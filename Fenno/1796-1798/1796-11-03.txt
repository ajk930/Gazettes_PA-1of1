PHQCIONâNo. XV. |
IN the preceding numbers i r . has been faticfafto- I
rily shewn, that Mr. Jefferfon, while Secretary of j
State, countenanced the intrigues of Genet, till i
they had proceeded to such lengths as to rouse the t
people_ to support the President, and to csmpel the
secretary to unite with the reft of the adminiftrati- i
on in demanding his recall. I
This has been substantiated by various corrobora- t
ting circumstances, and direst proofs. S.' (
Ift By the publications in the National Ga- c
â ette, by a clerk of Mr. feffetfon, reprobating the i
President's conduct, and exhorting Genet to perse- \
'â vere in llis opposition, far months after Mr. JefFer- ~ e
son knew that Genet was refiftiog the government.
2d By the which prevented the re- .
call of Genet, from the time of his firft open aft j
against the government, till the 16th August, and r
which could only have arisen from Mr. Jefferfon's
opposition in the cabinet to that measure. r
3d. His advice to eonvoke congress, a measure a
urgently demanded by Genet, and bis opposition to m
the iffuiig the proclamation of neutrality. {
4th. The writings of Htbidius again II that pro- p
clamation, composed by a confidential friend of his, /,
and qu"ted by Genet, as authority on his fide. , 1;
sth. Genet's charging him Vvith defeSion, after }
having profefled to be his friend, and initiated him r
into myjleries, which had inflamed his hatred against r
, the government, and aecufing him of having two si
languages, one confidential the other official. 0
6thl His being an enthujiafik admirer of the Cl
-I"reneh cause. 0
7th. His beirfg recommended and pointed out by f (
Cit.zcn Fauchet, in his intercepted letter, as the tl
man wham the Patriots had fixed on as President, i (
{hewing that Jefferfon was considered by Fauchet, _
as a friend to Genet's intrigues, notwithstanding ct
his official letter! r ,
We shall new proceed to notice some other fea
tures of Mr. Jeffcifon's violent aversion to the roea-
Alresof the federal government, which will still fur
ther prove his participation in the views of the Na- ?'
tional Gazette. iti
The friends and advocates of Mr. Jefferfon have
made no scruple to boafl of his abhorrence of the
leading principles of the adminifl ration of the finances
of the United States ; and the National Gazette, one rt
â Vis the maiii objeAs of which was te abuse that ad- m
mimftiation, in confornsity to that abhorrence, went
so far in one of the numbeis, as to urge the rnctjji. ?
~ly of a revolt. 4 n, in order to overthrow the whole
system of public credit. */
. ,Tbe leading principles of our fifcal adminiftrati- C 3
on were, that the public debt ought to be provided
far, in saver of thpfe, who, according to thcexprefs
terms of the cantraft, were the true legal proprie
tors of it ; that it ought to be provided for, inoiher
refpcifts, according to the terms of the contrast, m
except so far as deviations f.om it fho'uld be a/Ten- P c
ted to by the creditors, upon the condition of a fair' &
equivalent, that it oug.ht to be funded upon afcer- P a
tained revenues, pledged for the payment of inte- irr
. #â¢(!, and the gradual redemption of principal, that ct)
the debts of the feveial Rates ought to be compri-
led in the provision, on the fame terms with that of v "
the United States, that to render this great opera- te
tion practicable, aveid the oppreflion of trade and
indullry. and facilitate loans to the government,' in
cases ot, emergency, it was necessary to inftitut'e a P l,
rational indijefl taxes were in the aflu- co
al citcumftanccs of the oonntry, the most tligihle , aS
rtieapsof revenpe, and that dite<9 taxes ought to be Â° c
avoided as much, and'as long as poflible. tu 1
How, I aver from comperent opportunities, of au
know ing Mr. jefferfon's ideas, that he has been tk
cidedly hofiile to all these pofi'ions, except perhaps wc
the last, and thai, even in regard to that, his max- m 8
ims would .oblige the government in practice spec- rel
diiy to tefort to diredl taxes, > a t
1 aver morro-rer, that his opposition to the adrni- wc
niftration of the government has not been confined an<
to the measures conseftcd with the Treasury De- ? r
partnv. Nt, but has cxrended to almost all the impor-
lint mcafuies ft the governmeÃt. , M
It Mr. Jed 1 Ton's opposition to the measures
which are scfloeaed with the admi Ã iftration cf the the
, national finanrri had ceased, when those measures
had received the fÂ»nsion of haw, nothing more
â¢ could have been said, than, that he had trarrfg.ef
fed the rales ef official decorum, in entering the
lifts against the head of another department (be
, tween whom and himfelf, there was a reciprocal
duty ta cultivate harmony) that he had beta culpa
ble in pursuing a line of conduct, which wascaleu
lated to sow the feeds of discord in the executive
branch of the government in the infancy of its eÂ»-
s ' ijlence.
But when his opposition extended beyond that
v point, when it was apparent, that he withed to
render ediout and of course to fubntrl (for in a po
pular government these are eonvertible terms) all
rhofe deliberate and solemn a&s of the legislature,
which had become the pillars of the public credit,
his conriudt deserved to be regarded with a still se
verer eye.
What differences of opinion may have preceded
those exceptionable particular sea-<
turcs in them may have appeared to certain cha
rafters, there is no enlightened nor discreet citizen
but must agref, that they ought when clothed with
the fanftion of the law to remain undijlurbed. To
set afloat the funding system, after she faith as the 1
nation bid been so deliberately and solemnly pledged '
to itâafter such numerous and extensive alienations 1
of property for full value had been even made un '
- der its fan&ionâwith adequate revenues, little '
burthenfotne to the peopleâin a time of profound '
peaceâwith not even the Jhadow of aÂ»y public
* necejjityâon no better graund than that of theorem '
tical and paradoxical dogmasâwould have been '
one of the most wanton and flagitious eSs, that c
ever flained the annals of a civilized nation. '
Yet positions tending to that difgiaceful result r
were maintained in public discourses, by individuals, }
known to be devoted to the then secretary of state,
and were privately smiled upon, as profound disco- 1
veries in political science. F
Yet the 1 rfÂ» discreet, though not lead important 1
' parthans of that officer, spake familiarly of undoing '
the funding fyfl-.m, as a meritorious work : Yet bis
gazette ( which may fairly be regarded as the mirror r
of his views) after having labored for months to i 1
make it an object of public deteftstion, told us at 1!
â  length, in plain and triumphant terms, that " the
f funding system had had its day and very clearly,
1 if not expressly, that it was the objeS oj the party
t ta overthrow it*."
e It may be justly then, and from fuffiiient data,
- inferred, that Mr. Jefferfon's politics, wiile secre
tary of date, tend to national disunion, injgnijicance, >â¢
- disorder and discredit. That the fubverion of the
finding system would have produced mtional dif- a
â¢ credit, proves itfelf. Loss of credit, the -eafon be- b
: ing the fame, mud attend natianj, as wallas indi- C(
â¢ vidualj, who voluntarily and without nec:ffity, vi- 0
- 'date their formal and positive engagements f,
Injignificancc and disorder, as applied tccpmmu- w
- nities, equally with individuals, are the natural off it
t spring of a loss of Credit, premeditately and Wunta- g
1 rily incurred.
Â» Dlswrnaw would not long lag behind. Sober- r(
minded and virhwus men, in every Rate, wotid lose k
: all confidence in, and all refpeft for a govenment, tl
J which had betrayed so much levity and inainfiftl

of the republic, (z 2d July, 1795) have resolved to

whatever may concern the advantages and the com- te

A PARAGRAPH in the Aurora of Wednef- '
day, following so soon citizen Adet's note, publish- *
ed in that paper of Moacay, is a faithful comment t
, on that note ; the Aurora threatens us with -war a
from France, if we ele<S John Adams, president. v
What does this prove but that the note was calcu- h
lated, at the present jumfture, to excite that alarm, P
and thus to influence the ekttion. And will the real *
Â»nd independent Americans be so crouching as to r
have a president forced upon them by such daring
manoeuvres ? Is rot such a proceeding fufficient to Â°
alarm us for our liberties, and to roufe'that inde- f)
pendent spirit for which true American* are diftin - a
guifhed ? ft
What, if the Br'uifh minifler had pirblffhed at '1
the present juncture, a note endeavoring to alarm c
our fears about war ; and a newspaper, known to
be devoted to that minister, were immediately to Â°
threaten us with war, if we did not eledl as prcfi- t ]
dent, the candidate declared to be mod agreeable o
to that nation ? And does it make any difference, 0
at to our independence, whether the attempt comes 11
1 from oi)e nation or another ? Citizens of America, n
beon your guard, this is the crifu, when foreign P

im- SIR, j
the have the honour to acknowledge the receipt Â©f j
â¢ded your note of the s?th n,t- cover ' n g a decree of the <
Executive Direaory of the French republic, concern- f
ing the commerce of neutral nations c
This decree makes no diftintfiion between neutral a
powers who can claim only the rights secured to them i
by the law of nations, and others, between whom and ]
lf f. the V'reneh republic treaties have imposed special obli- 1
ifh- E atlons - Where no treaties exist, the republic, by
ent ! ClZln / and eonfifcat,r, g Â«he property of their enemies, t
found on board neutral vessels, would only exercise an r
acknowledged right under the law of nations, If to- t
ward Â» such neutral nations tfee French republic has for- o
cu. borne to exercise this right, the forbearance has been fl
â m, perfectly gratuitous. The United States, by virtue of
fa | their treaty of commerce with France, stand on diife
to rent ground.
In the year France voluntarily entered into a
Â» commercial Jreaty with us, on principles of perfeift re
eiproerty ; .W expreftly fitting, that f rie
e ' Jhould make free goods That is, if France should br
io- at war with any nation with whom the United States
should be at peace, the goods (except contraband) and
at the persons of her enemies (i'aldiers in a&ual service 1
rm exce P ted) found on board die vessels of the United v
to St * tes : wc ' e .!Â° from capture. That, on the V
other hand, if the United States should engage in war
with any nation, while prance remained at peace J
then the goods (except contraband) and the perfohs of C
ble our enemies ( soldiers in axSfual service excep-ed ) found U
ce, on board Frfnch vessels, were also to be free from can (
, es ture. This is plainly expressed in the twenty-third ar
tide of that treaty, and demonstrates, that ihe reci-
â¢ procity thereby stipulated, was to operate at differ,-nt
n periodsâThat is, at one time in favour of cneof the ai
J eomtrafting parties, and of the other at another time <!â 
O" the P re / en ' tin J e . the United States being at peace! ft
ent they possess, by the treaty, the right of carrying the
r a - goods of the enemies of France, without fubre<Sine
them to capture. But what do the spirit of the decree "
of the Execiifive Diredory, and the current of your ,
observations, require ? That'the United States should Ia
now gritu.toufly renounce .his right. And what rea
Â«Â», Â»ffig"Â«d tor denying to us the enjoyment of this U
>ry, ht ? /, our own words turnifh the answer. Â« France, le
'hi, r "Â»J United States, could find only a tl
<Â»", ,f'pdvarttage in the articles of that treaty, which U

ing to a comment upon these infiauations. .
You are also pleased te refer to your letters of March
:d 4 and April, last, relative to imprrfles of American sea
men by Britilh shins ; and complain, that the govern
:to ment of the United States had not made known to you
the steps they }>ad taken to obtain fatisfatftion- This,
lir, was a matter wiich concerned only that govern
ment. As an independent nation, we were ndt bound
. to render an account to any other, of the roeafures we
io j. deemed preptr for the of our own citizens,
ol _ so long as there was not the slightest ground to fufpedl
ona that thegoverimient ever aequiefced in any aggression. '
But permit-to recur to the lubjedl of the decree
lfe- ps the Executive Directory.
na - As before observed, we are officially informed, that
' re ~ the Biitilh government have ififod no new orders for
capturi#g the vefielsof the United States. We are also
Q d n " official!/ informed, that on the appearance of the noti- j
fication of that decree, the minifler of the United ! '
States at Paris, applied foi information, " whether or- | ]
en, " ders were ill'ued for the fejzure of neutral veilels, and j
ave " was that no such order was ifiued ; and |
lall " further, that none such would be iflued, in cafe the ,
f " rl ââ * seize our veflels." This eommunica- .
' nd tion from the minifterof the United States at Paris, to \
we their minister in London, was dated the jÃth if Au- ,
)ur *Â»Â«â¢' ut t^le decree Â°f the Directory bears date the <
ro- 'f tll Mcffider, aufwering to the id of July. These i
en- circumstances, together with some observations in your
ly note, leave the American government in a state of un
:es, certainty of the real intentions of the government 6f
er, France. AllÂ»w nie, then, to aÂ®, whether, in the ac
the tual state of things, our commerce is considered as Ha
lf- ble to ftiffer any new* reSridfions on the part of the
in Â° French republic*.' Whether the re/TVainrt now excrcifed ]
by the Britilh government are considered as of a nature
t k e to juftify a denial of those rights which are pledged to
us by our treaty with your nation ? Whether orders
â hy have been adluatly given to the ships of war and priva- 1
sice teers of the French republic to capture the vessels' of
the United States? And what, if they exist, are the
pre<*ife ternts of those orders ?
_ 1 hefe questions, fir, you will fee are highly interest- i
tng to the United Stares. It is with extreme concern
that the government finds hfel. reduced to the necessity -
of a/king an explanation of.t his nature ; and if itfliall I
be informed that anew line of condutf is to be adapted ]
towards this countrv, on the ground of the Decree re- 1
terredto its surprize will equal its regret, that prisci- l
ef pies fhoul J now be questioned, which, after repeated
he discussions, both here and m France, have been deraon
n- itratea to be founded, as we conceive, in the 1
ons of impartial neutrality, of stipulations by treaty ]
a' and o f law of nations. I hope, lir, you will find '
m it convenient, by an early anfvrer, to remove the fuf- (
id penie in which the Government of the United States is
li- bow hcid on the questions above stated.
>y I shall close this letter by one remark on the fineulari- ,
s, !y of your causing the publication of your note. As it
m concerned the United States, it was properly a'ldreffed '
a- to its government, to which alone pertained the right
r- of con,rrain,eating it in such time and manner as it -
:n mould think fit, to the citizens of the United States.
