AT a juncture when the question of j
a Commercial Treaty utiti France may soon
become an objc& of discussion, a work of this kind
becomes extremely ufefnl to thofo eitizens of the
United States, who may be defirons to enable them
selves to view this fubjedt, under its various af
pe^it; and they will have the faÂ£isfadion~to be
furnilhed with the necessary data, to judge of the
ufefnlnefsof this tranfallioa.
This work is principally diftinguilhed by the
rlchnefsof the obfervaMons, the pcrfpituity of the
iJcat, and the modesty of the theory which it
contains. At Pars, a man of wit observed, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufeful produce. It is addref â¢
fed te the unfortunate La Favktte, in letters,
which fugitive form, the author who could only
devote a few weeks to this occupation, wat obliged
to adopt. Although circumftancis are ill many
refpeds different at the present day, from what
they were in the year 1790, when these letters
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so ma
ny absolute and permanent data still remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate\the work
left on that account; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
sult of the author's remarks, it will serve to con
vince him that in all tranfadions, between free
nations, every thing maybe expe&ed from the ef
forts of truth andjuftice.

Observations on money, weights and mcafuret.
LETTER 111.
ElTay in the form r,f a tableau, to appraise the im
poitations into the United StatesJron France and Eng
land united. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better (urnifhed Irom France or
Englandâlt is principally on this fubjed (whith
would haveaftonifhed a mere theorifl) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kind of tableaux, uuluckily as difficult to obtain as
they arc much to be desired, are the only sure guides
the llatefman can take for th policy of treaties de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We cannot too much admire the apparent ex
aduefs of colonel Swan's calculations; and although
the proplicfies of Lord Sheffield have already been
contradided by experience, and by several able pens,
yet it is curious to lee the author of the present work,
dispute with him the only ground on which he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving jhat France,
under the tequired condition, will fcg better able
than Great Britain to supply us with several articles,
which the Englilh auihot allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter j the author's partiality tjjeft m (if he
has any) does not appear to have at any time created
a partiality Â»f judgment. Ihe result of this calculation
is that in 1789, that is to fay, at a period when arts
and manufadures did Â»ot preient in France the valt
means and probability of extension which they now
possess. that even in Â«789, it was prelumable, that
France would not only have the means to supply one
half of-anv given quantify of the pr<Â»dudions of France
and l ngUtnd united, butalfoto enter into competition
with Gieai Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wildom of her government, and the indullry
of her inhabitants.
LETTER IV.

and particular examination of their iuiiablenelt to

excell nt work of Mr. Tench Coxe, Mr. Swan's /Â«-
Ueau is by no meant fupcifluous . the principle of the
advantages which would result to France from the
importation of provihoita and raw materials, it every
where applied ; and it is upon this argument, that
the author eflablilhes his demands to the French go
vetnmenr, tor the limited ad million of the produc

timeâOpinions of the author on the finances, 011 the
etÂ»e*l< of na lomi debt, on circulating, &c. as more i
amply detailed in his National Arithmetic printed at i

LETTER VI
Gensral examination of the defeft* of ihe commer
cial policy of France with refpeft to the United States;
many oÂ£ these observations have produced the efFe&s
for which they Â«were intended, others (till remain,
pointing out the reforms to be made in future, as a
good chart marks the fhoats and rocks. The author
concludes his work, by fixing his attention on his
country, and the great men who have rerdered it il
lustrious; and we take a pleafurc in quoting what he
fays of the present chief of our government. To
praise a man when he exercises a diltinguilhed em
ployment, is common, and may be taken'for flattery j
but whilst he is* in private life, it is the homage of
sincerity.

T/TJ DIGNITY OF GOVERNMENTâ No. 11.
Is it not oniverfally acknowledged, that ihe a-
I bufe of public characters has tarnilhcd the A
meriean name, and that all parties regiet tnis
abuse when it lights on their own favorite. Why
1 then do not all unite in coiredting an error
! which all at fame timne difipprove There nev
-1 er can cxiftany circuinftances that may jollify
j abuse. Truth, and candour, are the bcftfliitrjii
of defense in a good cause, and the bell weapons
to beat down error and falfehood. These sn
liven and captivate the human mind ; and the
pervei fe spirits which are not influenced bv them
are loft forever. Who that knows the illuftri
oua men who were the great instruments in the
hand of Providence to accomplilh the revolution,
but hasfelt an indefcrihabre twinge of heart ard
repulfiv; indignatiap at feeing abuse flaw from
the tongues and peV.s of falfeho.id ajjaii ft the
fathers ut our country ? It has been the f tc of
all countries to produce fueh demons of iliford,
and they are the ready instruments of tyranny
1 as ready to flatter bad men, at 10 abuse good
) men ; having no moral principle to regulate
1 aflions they go to all extremes and are bought
ar.d fold with money or frniles or love or hatred,
by aiiy paflion or any interest. Happy would
it be for merica if its air would no: nourift}
. such Beings ; but our newspapers too often prove
1 their cxiUence here.
Liberty has mure to fear frotji the poison of
1 these pretended friends, and the diffufion of their
r vices, than from all the weapons European def
potj car. form /gainll her. "Honour thyfclf,"
1 i. an ancieat maxim, and Americans (hould
write it upon their hearts ; we ought to feel an
hoi'.eft pride in our name, an t glory in our
country. The merits of a Washington, and a
long lift of othti retired patriots, with the il
lultriousnam's now in the firft feats in govern
-1 ment, feed the the just ardour for our conntry's
1 farrt in ev.ry bosom. The moment men ceale
" to love their country'i friends, their patriotism
expires. Nor ought our criticism ever to befo
* fevereasto lose fight of prevailing virtues, if
j some errors sere unhappily mingled. Shall
the inadvertencies of a day or an hour becloud
the Ready fun and general tefior of life. But a
y diflin&ion as wide as heaven and earth, (hou.d
3 forever be pr-itrved between good and bad
men, that virtue and her friends may receive
their reward, and the world be accelerated in
its progress to brighter eras. A god man is a
blefting in every circle, in government he is in
eflimable j and every heart ought to be a barrier
f to his. In proportion to the di/lintlions of mo
ral charaÃers, in the gdneral eflimatioo, will
every community rife or fink. Thi<, revelation
afitires us, and reason confirms it j it is .a law
in the intelligent univÂ»rfe, wh ch no beings can
, invert; and by the observance of it individuals
] and nations afcrnd the fca'e of dignity ai d hap
piness. Should not therefore this principle pe
netiate the bolom and be planted deep in the
. heart of rulersâand the people' inspire it as the
1 vital spring of free exiflence, and fix the idea
,1 in the budding mind of their infant offspring ?
A purr chaiactu in government, is
t durable cement of the facial union ; it isanin
-4 exhaustible source ; It commands all the wealth
- and ftretigth of the whole nation to guard its
e rights, and to accelerate every measure for pub
' lir happiness ; it is the animating foul of a na
tion. The ancier.t republics pcrilhed for want
1 of it. It now rd.iains to be ascertained by
experience, whether our republic u ill occupy the
j yet vacant feat in tjiis m oil sublime temple of
fame. Heisunwerthy to rule the free, who
1 does aim at itâand he is a blot to creation
who gives a vote for a man whose foul is not
elevated towards it.
n Let not rulers or people be lulled in their
Humbert to profound sleep, by the common
t place talk " that it is in vain to expedl that our
people and government (ho Id be more wife or
k virruous than those of ether countries." Such
remarks are often repeated \vith an air of grave
Â® sagacity ; but they tend to extinguish that hope
:, j which i> the spring of a<flion, and to futfl the
prophecy, therefore they (hÂ«u!d be repelled.â
1, he contemplation of great and good objedU,
| fays a sublime writer, " ajjimulates the mind
and mallei it grest."
ThiHis the nature of man ; the-individual,
e or the nat on, that would ascend to glory, mult
e have elevated views above the walk of common
minds; and unbounded by what others have at
chievtd.
ii If Americans wish to be the great, the just,
the glorious nation which theii*extenfive regions
â and the bounties of nature stem to hztfe design
ed, and the dispensations of Providence point to,
they ought to fear more than dÂ«th the least de
parture from the strait line of honourâAn in
advertent flep in government mult never be de
fended, but instantly reformed âThe only en
qun"y be, "for the path of â¢wisdom"; and put
from us precedents that will not accord with its
diflates. 80 may lue attain the summit of hu

good men bound their terrellrial views.
* MR. FENNO,
I hare read the ftatcments in the papers
printed last evening and this morning of the
discipline administered by Mr. Grifwold to
the Knight of the IVooden Sword, that infamous
fpitler Lyon ; and I have Seen mortified to
perceive, from the general representation,
nothing which truly exhibits the faftâThe
truth is, Mr. Grifwold advanced towards
Lyon with the calm and unruffled dignity,
for which he is as mnch diftinguilhed as any
man in America. He was seen by Lyon,
r , whom he addrefTed before the firft blow,
, which was aimed-at and received by his
shouldersâblows were repeatedâno refif-.
tance made, but inllead of it, the wretch
( fled until he seized a pair of tonga- thus
armed he turned on Mr. Grifwold and it bc
-1 came aeceflary to throw him on the fluor.
About this time the house was called'to or
' der, and Mr. Grifwold with a noble felf
command left bis prey and as unruffled as u
sual took his feat. What happened with
out the bar, was a blow given by LyCm to
Mr. Grifwold ; which though aimed from
behind and undefended, was too feeble to do
â n injury.
4 A few words, Mr. Printer, explanatory
of the conduit of Mr. GrifwoldâLyon
was the firft aggrefTor, none of hia party
have had the audacity to deny it. The na
ture of thisjaggreflianâif was introduced
* relative to a fubjtft before the house. TJjc
intention, tÂ«> influence the votes of the mem
bers of Connecticut. The meads employed,
intimidation, accompanied witbdireA cbsrg-
Â«â¢ jjf corruption, servility, and falfcliood.
Outrageous and gross as wat this conduft,
it would better have become the dignity of
Mr. Grifwold's charaftcr,feeling as he mull,
for the authdr, ineffable fcoin, to have treat
ed him with lilent negleft. But in allulion
to his threat of controuling the public opin
ion of the enlightened State of Connefti
cut by his own personal charafter and influ
ence, it surely was not unnatural to hint,
at that part of hishiflory, which would ren
der him as contemptible in Connefticut as
he ought to be in Vermont. The abomi
nable aft which followed, which is without
example, and the turpitude of which no
words can describe, Mr. Grifwold, from
refpeft to the house, did not instantly re
venge, This amiable command of temper,
I this refpet\fnl attention 10 the tine, and fleet
which should have secured a just punishment
to the nujly beajl, was, in Whispers, repre
sented as ati evidence of cowardice. Tho'
I Lyon flood before the house convifted of
crimss which would hay*. expelhd from the
society of any Other aflociation in the Unit
ed States, whether legal, convivial or even
jpctlinic, yet a faftiou retained him there be
eaiife, forfooth, the house was not in order,
and because the rights of the people of Ver
mont might be injured by depriving them of
their representativeâyes, Lyon, the pure
Mr. Lyon, is retained in his feat for the
honcr and interest of hi. cooftituents. Thus
circumstanced what CAuld Mr. Grifwold do
but what he has done, revenge the injury in
the place where it was inflifted, and before
thole who were witnesses of it ? And (hew
to those who have the lesson yet to learn,
that to prevent private revenge, gross injuries
mufl he redrejfed by authority. Painful a#
must have been the necessity which imposed
this duty, it has been nobly performed.

T.HI ECONOMIST.
In Europe, where bankrupt laws are com
monly provided, all but the merchants are
excluded from the benefit of them. This is
done on an idea that no one, excepting those
who are engaged in commerce, ought to be
under circumstances to need such a remedy.
Every one whose expectations are not con
nefted with the hazard incidental to com
mence, ought to order his affairs in such a
maimer, as that he can fee his creditors with
confidence, andjuftice. We have more in
ftancesperhaps, in New-England, ofthe infol
veney of Farmers and Tradesmen, than there
are in any of the European countries. The
reason is, that too many of the people of
these clafFes engage themselves in concerns
to which their abilities are incompetent, and
calculate upon profpefts which have no so
lid foundation. Their expences exceed their
income before they are aware of it, and hav
ing once found themfelvetin arrear,they be
come discouraged, and although they then
reason accurately enough to fee their error
when it is too late, yet they find no means
of relief. There are instances, where trades
men and farmers enter upon commerce, and
make distinguished and reputable figures in
the buCnefs ; but if is always seen, that they
introduce themselves by cautious lteps, ex
amine well every inch of their progress, and
never risk any thing, until they have acqui
red a capital, or obtained to a filiation,
which is commonly called before-handed; and
then, never adventure more, than they can
l>ear the loss of. These men have nothing
to do with haiard, and are habitually Eco
nomics.
The Farmer, who attends to that kind of
business, as the only hope for th-e advance
ment of hi* interest, and the fuppoitofhis
family, is an habitual economist. He caK
culates annually, how many bnfhels of corn,
and how many tons of hay a certain num
ber of acres will produce. He measures
the needed quantity, by the known expen
ditures of his family, and extends his plan
of agriculture to the payment of taxes; the
expences of cloathing, and of foreign lux
uries. A small sum of money loaned on in
terest, raises a shelter against an accidental
storm, and affords courage to meet the de*
clinc of life, and the infirmities of advanced
age.
The Tradesmen who depends altogether
upon his vocation, are at all times determi
ned with a great degree of certainty, what
the expences of the ensuing year will be ;
and on an ealy calculation of his expefted
earnings, can keep his expenditures within
the ensuing year will be ; andon an easy cal
culation of his expefted earnings, can keep
his expenditures within the limits of them.
So the Clergymen, and others, who depend
upon fixed salaries, do very well with a small
income. This is, because their situation
make them habitual economists, and they
are ready habitually, when they fee an ar
ticle they wish for, to compare the price of
it with their ability to pnrchafe it. This
they do with a mechanical readiness, as o
thers play on or count in numbers.
But whenever people determine to possess
what they fee, because it would be conve
nient to have it, or because ojhers have the
fame, or because they would proudly lead
in the fafhion, then there is an end of all
economy.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY âFEBRUARY 16.
Immediately .upon the Journal's having
been read,
Mr. Davis (Kent.) rose and proposed
the following refolut ion for the adoption of
tlie houfej
" RefolveÂ«ithat Roger Grifwold and Mat
thew Lyoo, members of this house, for
violent and disorderly behaviour committed
in the house, be expelled therefrom."
Mr. Nichelashoped the resolution would
be permitted to lie on the table.
Mr. Davis saw 110 reason for delaying a
decifioji upon this refolutiou, He thought
the conduit of these gentlemen had been so
grofslv violent, and so notorious to most-os
the members of the house, that there need
|be no hesitation in deciding upon it. If
! gentlemen wiflied, however to take the fame
; course which had been adopted on a former
occasion, he should not objeft 'to it, though
he thought it unneceffaiy. It was needless,
now to fay any thing as to the necessity of
preserving the dignity and honour of that
i house; enough had already been said, and
he thought pertinently said, </> a former
occalion on this fubjeft. And as he believ
ed neither the dignity, the honour, or peace
of that house could be preserved whilst these
members remained in it, he hoped the house
would be unanimous in voting their cxpul
fion.
Mr. Thatcher did not fee why the inno
cent should be puniftied with the guilty.
The gentleman who brought forward this
proposition, he supposed, did not wish this.
From what he saw of this affray, he did
not think Mr. Lyon deserved to be punished
for the part he afted. He certainly receiv
ed a severe beating, but he appeared to be
passive from thebeginningto thf end; and he
did not think Mr. Lyon ought to be expell
ed because he was beaten. As to any investi
gation of what happened yesterday, he did
not think it needffary as mod of the members
ps that house were eye witnesses to the faft.
But the gentleman said there would be no
peace until these members were expelled.
He did- not know from what he drew his
conclulions. What waÂ» done yesterday,
was done before the house was in session;
and it had been already determined that afts
of violence committed without the bar, du
ring a ftffion ofthe house, are not causes of
expulsion. He did not know, therefore,
how gentlemen would support the doftrine
that a member ought to be expelled for an
aft of violence done before the house wa* in
feifion. It might be necessary, however to
investigate Pther fafts conncfted with these.
Mr. J. Parker seconded the motion for
the expulfmn of these members, because he
believed there would be no peace in the
house until they were expelled. He was
sorry the gentleman'from Massachusetts
should have said he saw nothing but what
was passive on the part of Mr. Lyon. He
himfelf saw more, and that the gentleman
must have seen ft, if he had his eyes about
him. He said, that after the offending
members had been separated, Mr. Lyon met
Mr Grifwold without the bar of the house
and began to belabour him with his cane,
when they were again separated. The at
tack of yesterday, Mr. P. said, at the time
when the house ought to have been in session
though it had not come to order, would
fix an indelibleJlain upon it; and if these
members were not expelled no member could
consider himfelf as fafein his feat. Such a
tranfaftion would certainly lower that house
in the estimation of their constituents. He
had even heard this morning, as he came to
the hall, persons in the street call out, There
is nothing to do in Congress to-dayâthere's no
fighting going on! In order to get rid of
tkefe reproaches, he hoped all parties would
unite in expelling these members. If their
constituents chose to fend them back, he
hoped no member would jffot iate with, or
take notice of them. And if a vote of ex
pulsion should be agreed upon, he would af
terwards move'to expunge from the Journ
als, all the entries relative to these disgrace
ful proceedings.
Mr. Nicholas wished the motion to lie up
on the for the present, because he was
not himfelf prepared to decide upon the
fubjeft; he wished also, that whenever the
motion was taken up, gentlemen might
came with their minds determined upon it,
so that a long debate might noc be necessary.
He therefore moved to postpone the consid
eration of this resolution on Monday.
Mr. Gordon wiflied to know what part
of the resolution the gentleman from Vir
g'nia was not ready to aft upon?
Mr. Nicholas did not understand the drift
of the gentleman's question. If he meant
to a fit whether he (Mr. N.) disapproved of
the vote he had already given, he would an
swer him, he did not.
Mr. J. Williams said he should approve
of the motion for postponement, if it were
made for to-morrow, instead of Monday ;
ana he hoped the business would not only be
taken up to-nioriow, but be concluded be
fore they rose. He had fat with great pa
tience during the late debate ; but he should
be opposed to going into any farther lesgthy
proceedings 011 so disagreeable a fubjeft,
which would prevent them from doing the
business of the nation, for which they were
sent.
Mr. Nicholas had no objeftion to make
the question the order for to-morrow, if the
house met.
Mr. Thatcher observed, that he had be
fore said that he had seen nothing on the
part of Mr. Lyon inihe affray of yesterday
which ought to fubjeft him to expultion ;
but the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Par
ker) said, that if he (Mr. T.) had had his
fyes about him he might hove seen fomc
thing for which he ought to be expelled.
If, indeed, he had eyes behind he might have
seen what he alluded to, but this sot being
the cafe,he did net fee it. Aa far as ills bu
siness refpe&s Mr. Lyon.fome enquiry might
be necessary; as all that saw he was, that
Mr. fuffered much, without any of
fence on his part. He thought, therefore,
the business fliould be gone into, as on a
formei occasion, and that they ought to ex
amine the fubjeft with cando'jr, and- then
thsy (hould doubtless decide upon it with
propriety.
Mr. Sitgrcaves was against the poUpiae-"
ment, in order that a different course might
be taken. He knew nothing in this cafe
which diftinguiflied it from a late cafe, and,
therefore, could not fee why the fame course
ought not to be purfucd as was then pur
sued. He (hould, therefore, vote agamlt *.
postponement, in older that the refolutioa
might be referred to the committee of pri
vileges.
Mr. Harper enquired whether fue'n a mo
tion would nofefupercede a motion for post
ponement.
The Speaker said it would.
Mr. Harper then made the motion.
Mr. Gallatin asked whether he understood
the Speaker rightly, that a motion for a re
ference to a committee fupercededa motion
for postponement?
The Speaker faicK he did.
Mr. Nicholas asked whether it would not
then be in order, to pwftpons the considera
tion of the fubjedft ?
The Speaker answered, it \yould.
Mr, Nicholas renewed the motion for *
poliponement till to-morrow.
Mr. Harper believing that it would be
proper to refer this resolution to a commit
tee, astefore, elpecially as fomeof thc-fc&s
did not pals within the view of the hou.fei._-,
he (hould (hould voteagainlt the postpone
ment. Not because he wished to avoid a
vote on the question"; for Tf it (hould be
opinion of the house that it ought not to gÂ» â¢
to a committee, he was perfectly -ready-to â¢â¢
give a vote upon the question ; but he tho't;
it better that the business (hould have this
course. With refpeft to any discussion be- "
ing necessary upon this fubjetl, he p.-rhap*"-
might think it necessary to make some ob^Â»
fervations upon itâ when the queftipii came
before the house for decifiou ; for though -
some gentleman might be endued with the."
happy faculty of doing every thing in an in- '
ftant, he could not boast of possessing that
faculty. But even if he were no* desirous'
of discussion for his own information, he
wi(hed it jjor the information of the public
and notwithstanding all that the house had
heard aboat a wade of public moneyVml
public time, he believed they (hould best
serve the public by fuffering the bufmefs te
take the usual course.
The motion for a poftpontment was put
and negatived.
Mr. Sitgrcaves then movtd that the re
folutioa be referred to the Committee of
Privileges. ~
Mr. Harper moved that the committee
have leave to fit during the session of the
house.
Mr. Thatcher thought, as it was proba
ble a number of members might be wanted,
to give evidence, the house had better ad
journ, as on a former occasion, as it would
not be proper to go on with business when
so many members were absent.
Mr. T. Claiborne hoped leave would not
lie granted for the committee to fit immedi
ately. He wiftied them coolly to deliberate
upon the business, which they could scarce-
Iy be expected to do, while their passions
were so ilrongly affeAed as they rauft be at
present.
The question for leave to (it during the
session was put and carried 45 to 36.
Mr. Harper movtd that the committee
be inftru&ed to report 10 the house the evi
dence, in writing, upon which they fliall
found their report.
Mr. Ivittera thought the fafts were so
notorious that there was no neceflity for this
inftruftion.
Mr. Harper said, if his friend from Penn
fylvaoia could fay that every body would be
fatisfied with the report of the committee,
without the evidence, lit would not infill
upnn his motion. But if the evidence was
not reported, how could he fay that all the
might not again be called before
the house. It was his wi(h to prevent this.
Mr. J. Willia.Tls said, there was a co'nffd
erable difference betwixt this tranfaflipn and
the one lately under consideration. He
thought iu this cafe, it would probably save
much trouble to report the evidence.
Mr. Brooks said" it mult" be recolledlec!
that the gentleVnan from Virginia was not
fatisfied with the former report. He wish
ed to hear the witnesses themselves; and if
th e evidsnce was to be reported, he di|d not
suppose it would be fatisfa&ory.
Mr. Nicholas seconded the motion, be
cause it would be likely to (horten the bu- â¢ *
(inefs ; but if, when the testimony came to
be reported, there was any obfeurity 111 it,
he (hould feel it necessary to aftc the~wftnef
fes questions by way of elucidation ( at e
very man who was called upon as a judge,
(hould be in full poffeffton of every faCtre'-a
tive to the fubjeft.
Mr. Brooks said the gentleman jiift fat
down, would have no difficulty in pointing
out some obfeurity, in order to furnilh an a
pology for a re-hearing of the witnesses.
Mr. Kittera. If to report the evidence
would prevent the uecefiity of hearing the
witnesses in the house, he (hould not objefl
to it ; but he believed this would not be the
cafe.
Mr. Venable was before of opinion, that
it would have beea bell for witnesses to have
delivered their evidence in writing ; he ho
ped that course wovld now be taken, and
then there would be no difficulty in report
ing it to the houfj ; and if it (hould b: found
necessary, in order to elucidate any part of
it, to put any quellions to the witnesses iÂ»
the house, the business would be greatly fa
cilitated and (hortenqd by the evidence beÂ»
ing reported.
The quellion was put and carried.

" At 8 o'clock this morning, a signal for
punishment was made on board the Cam
bridge guardfhip in Hamoaze, and repeat
ed immediately afterwards by the

after Evans, a Corporal of Marines,
and John Dixon, a seaman, late belonging
to the Saturn man of war, who were tried

crimes of Evans and Dixon being of a
more atrocious nature than the others, they
were sentenced by the Court Martial to be
hanged in chains after execution ; which Sen
tence being afterwards deemed derogatory
to the authority of Naval Court, it was
referred to the opinion of the twelve judges
who, it is understood, have not fan&ioned
the judgment of the Court, and which has
been the cause why the fate of those un
happy men has been so long suspended."

A Melancholy Fact.
.By a gentleman, just from the Sufquc
hannah, we are informed, that on Saturday
the loth instant, some malicious persons
wilfully set fire to and burnt a house near
the Canal, wherein were fix persons, all of
whom were consumed. The particular*,
as far as we can understand, are, that some
people belonging to the canal lodged with
the people of the house, whu disagreed, and
the party of the house having proved too
strong for the others, they went off; but
returning some time after with several others
entered the honfe by violence, killed two
children, and threw .them behind the fire;
then faftening the others in, set fire to the
house and burnt it; with all its contents.
The above gentleman further adds, that he
saw the body of one person, not wholly con
famed, and that five of the perpetrators of
this villainous deed were taken, and are in
confinement. ( Fed. Gaz.J

SATURDAY EVENING, fEBKWAkr 17.
ExtraS of a Utter from Norfolk of the Bth
tnjlaftt.
" I have a letter from my correspondent
at Guernsey datedthe - 2lft December, Hat
ing the intentions of the Direftory as hoflile
to this country, and in consequence some
veflels under American colors which had
been taken *p to load, had been flopped
from proceeding under a fear that a rupture
was unavoidable."
MR. TEMtiO,
The attempts of the friends of disorder
and confufion which were so fuecefsfully u
sed at the two late meetings at I.efher's and
Benders, in the city and Northern Liber
ties, were repeated this evening at Mr.
James Cameron's tavern, but we are happy
to fay this attempt met with a more deser
ved and a very different fatÂ£.
A Room in the above tavern was engag
ed by a few citizens on behalf of a larger
number (whose determination was to sup
port Benjamin R. Morgan at the approach
ing eleftion) with the view of deliberating
on and adopting such measures as they
(hould think necessary in the peaceable pur
suit of this determination.
Several attempts were made in the Â«arly
part of the evening by the friends of Israel
Israel, to obtain admifiion ; but these pion
eers of confufion relinquiihed their attempt
after being repeatedly aflured that the meet
ing contemplated was solely for the friends
ef Mr. After the retreat of these,
when the meetiug, which was numerous and
refpeftable, had organized themselves, and
proceeded to bufmefs ; the attempt to de
j feat its objeft was renewed by a numerous and
i daring mob, who attempted in defiance of
1 the above aflurance, which was frequently
| repeatedâto force themselves intotheroom;
, but was firmly refilled, and repelled ; and
: after vainly endeavoring to silence by clam
our and confufion out of doort, what they
had been prevented from effefting by force
within, they retreated.

Nothing gqve me more pfeafure than the
reading the last address of President Wash

by the Secretary. It was introduced by
one of the diftrift, and unanimously agreed
to be read: although lengthy, it was attend
ed toby the meeting, xruhthatrtfpeiS which
itfo justly merits from all real friends to their
country. The excellent doftnne and advice
it contains, deserve to be written in letters
of gold; and if duly and properly attended
to St this moment, when the very foundati
ons of our excellent constitution and la\vs
are menaced, by a daring and outrageous
foreign and dumiftic faftion, I think it
would have a very excellent effedlâand I
hope you will be kind enough to give it a

be read before the eleftion that will very

T# those 10bâ¢ have read this curious and valuablewwor t
it will need no recommendationâthey knoiv its solid merit
âbut as it has hitherto got into very feiu bands in this
country y it will nst be amfs to obferve â-so great was the
