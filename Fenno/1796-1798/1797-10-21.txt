Secretary of State to theSpanifh MiniOer's kppeal
1. one of those complete refutations which leave, no
room for an amplifying idea. It it neat, explicit
and deeifive It breathe, the spirit of an indepen

c.al and personal refpe<a. It will be read with
plcafore by every impatlialmind ; by every citi

with kindred sensations of patriotism and coi-fci
oua dignity.
COMMUNICATIONS.
The freeft and mod pointed animadversions on.
French affairs which have appeared in the gatettcs
of this country, were copied from French papers.
Foreigners may brandish their goose quills against
the United States, but the greatest calumniate;, of
the American charader are the writers in the Au
rora, Argu. and Chronicled. These three papers
have however been lying to very little purpose for
the last five or fix years, as is evidenced by the
numbers of emigrants who continue to flock into
the country. Had any faith been put in the repre
sentations of these fa&ionifts, Europeans must have
fnppofed the people in a state of misery and slave
ry, and the rulers tyrants and monsters.
The representations the characters and con
duel of men in office, as given in the Jacobin ga
zettes, are wholly destitute ef foundationâThey
do norlielieve them themfelvci, ths people do not
believe themâif they did, it would beeafyfor
the Jacobins to cempleat their plan of overturn
in the government.
If these lying varlets obtained credit in any
quarter of the Union, infurre&ion would be a
mod sacred duty there.
Volumes of abuse fcavo been written againd the
people,of America, particularly of the eadern
States, by various.ranters of high church and in
tolerant memory. The dribblers never found
their advantage in their publication!âthey become
Ihop lumber, at soon as they became extant.
It fecms that former ill fiiccels has not discour
aged them from recent similar attempts at defama
tion. The Editor of The Aurora has found some
precious morceaus for his paper in a late publica
tion of this damp from the pen of a Pruflian.
There is however more fallhood than malignity in
the samples given, but this deficiency is amply Sup
plied by the comments of the tranferiber.
If the Editor of the Aurora wilhes to procure
for his paper, blackguardifmi on the people of
New England, he may be furhiflied with a fcetter
assortment than his Prufliaa author, De Bulow,
can glvf, from a book written more than forty
years since.
The antifsderal faAion have labored for years
to prove that the majority of the people is with
them; notwithdanding which the printers who are
in opposition to the government complain of not
being lupported. Some of the charm ions of anti
federalifm have tried various lituations, without
success, and the profpcA dots ?ot biighten. They
charge their failure to the negleS of the wealthy
ps rt of the community. How reasonable this may
>e Is lelt to themselves to detes-mine. It certainly
is not a very natural expeaation, that they flloul<f
be encouraged in their efforts to undermine that
coMditution and those laws which form the only
bulwark to life, liberty and property. The truth
is, every man who possesses property, or expedts
to acquire it by honed industry, under the protec
tion of just laws, mud he opposed to the antifede
ral fa a ion ; the nlajority therefore is againd them.
After all it mud be acknowledged that some of
these gazettes have been and still are Supported, to
the great disgrace of our countryâThe means, it
is true, are invifihle ; still they are Supported.â
This number is however small.
A Hint to returning Phuadeiphmns.
â  The return of our fellow-citizens will,
doubtle'fg excite great caution, and every
pofiible exertion ought to be made to pro
cure perfect cleanliness throughout the ci
ty ; but it should be remembered that the
eau(eÂ« of disease generally lurk in hidden
plaees ; mere external purification, there
fore, (though pleasing to the eye) will B ot
dhace away the enemy.
Among the various modes that will pro
bably be suggested, I hope I fliall be par
doned for mentioning one, which, though
by no means new, may not be generally
adopted without a hi*t from some of your
correspondents.
I>t every house-keeper buy half a bushel
of quick lime, let it he pounded fine and
scattered throughout the cellars,
finks, and damp places of every defenption.
I will venture to aflert, that if this could
be uaiveffiflly done at one moment, the
whole city might be completely cleansed in
half an hour.
To persons, tolerably acquainted with
chemistry, this method of imbibing foul air j
will be understood to be infallible; but it â¢
may not he amife to inform the more nume- j
isds Â«lass of your readers, that lime is a
stone or earth deprived, by fire, of both air
and moiftuie ; that when in that state it
will attraft to Â£tf<lf what it has been deprived
' of, as readily as a dry fpwnge will take up
water j and that, by this absorption of the
more weighty and noxious part of the at
mosphere, the remaining part will become
: pure. I have gone into a cellar so very of
fenfive, that not only my nose but even my
eyes fufFered extremely ; but after I had
raised a fog of lime abbut me', the air became
as agreeable as it was'in the street.
I am content that .the simplicity of this
[ address should raise a fmije among philofo
. phers, ii the less enlightened and equally
i valuable part of the community should sol
â  low my advice. SfcNEX.

Communication.
In the neighborhood of Hoebock-Ferry
are to be found a considerable number of ser
pents of the kind denominated Copperheads ,*
I their bite is very venomous ; the poison diffu
-1 sing itfelf in a short time over a considerable
I part of the body, and producing fatal con
fluences, unlcfs an immediate antidote is
applied. A few weeks since a negro man who
had been at work in the fields of his employ
er, there took up a log of wood on his
shoulder, which was hollow nearly, through
froin one end and carried it home for his
evening fire. His wife and children (as is
usually the cafe in the country) had retired
to reft in one corner of the room, and he
was set down - at the fire, and nearly over
powered with sleep, when he perceived an
enormous snake, of the kind above mention
ed, Aiding foftly out of the aorner just be
fore him. Although powerfully impelled
by fear to attempt its immediate deftruftion,
he knew it would be dangerous to move left
the snake should spring at him. He there
fore remained quiet, and only followed the
motions of th<( serpent with his eyes, which,
(with an ereft head and a noise resembling
the cluck of a hen for her chickens) glided
backward and forward across the room, while
a eat followed the windings of his tail, and
frequently laid her paw upon it, without
heing noticed by *he reptile. At length
the serpent approached the fire again and
re-entered the wood, which the negro per
ceivings lie immediately flopped the aper
ture,' and kindling up a large fire, drew the
log across it, where it remained till the ser
pent was consumed. Â£ Timt-Piccel ]

RefUSions on the principles of the formation of
Political Society.
A Curious political work has made its
appearance in France, in which the author
endeavours tq. support the position that
war has every where been the originating
cause of the firft political affociationj. In
an army behold the type, the rough sketch
of the early social slate ; and. hence, too, is
it, that monarchy has been every where the
firft predominant form of government.âHe
distinguishes, in every kind of organized so
ciety, three efTcntial constituting elements,
from the various properties of which are de
rived all the diftinftions of political forms.
These three elements, are strength, or pow
er ; wisdom ; and genius, or in other words
democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy
Whatever may be the formation of a state,
or whatever its political denomination, these
three elementary pringiples ever exist therein,
and more or less preponderate. Power is
ever in the hands of the people, or multi
tude magistrates, nobility, and enlighten
ed citizens, of public spirit, represent wis
dom and sagacity ; but genius resides with
monarchy, or at least in that creative senti
ment of society, sailed legislation, the i
mage of ftipremacy ; or in other words a
king, a senate, a president, or whatever
may be the term of the representation ef the
majesty of aLe people.
Look at an army : the soldiers represent
democracy, or strength; to the officers,
whefe business it is to preserve discipline and
order, is entriiiied the care of regular action.
These are the men who, for own in
terest, slaves to any body that will pay them
for eteifiing in idleness, levy a useless contribu
tion on the indujlrious.
Monarchy lias in all ages attached what- >
ever it found, any thing like genius to itfelf.
It is time the tables were turned. As has
been often asked, what is monarchy ? Evi
dently the conspiracy of the cunning few, a
gainst the ignorant and undefigning many. If
genius is of any worth in the world, it should
evidently turn its attention to the equality of
mankind : of what Common value is ability
while iteontinues enliftedundertheflagoff*vr
felf-interefhd monarchy ?*Let us examine mat
ters right, and we shall find, that the three
elementary principles of all monarchy are
found in what is called an army. - Poor de
mocracy, and uninformed cannon-dragging
animals, are the support of the system.
The general, in an army, is always sup
posed to direst even tb ( e minutest movements
of bodies of men (combined to fight agaiuft
each other, frequently no one knows for
what). From the opinions or ablities of
these generals is the whole army afluated.
Under an abfolute-' general the body of an j
army are enslaved, and, for the most trifling
faults, are led to cruel and degrading pun
ishments ; tortured, perishing beneath the se
verity of a thousand lashes 1 These things
should be done away.
Possibly, from what appears to be the na
ture of mankind, this theory cannot in all
points be supported. However that may
be, legislators should know, that every just
government, and embracing 'the rights of
mankind, should include within itfelf the
germ of its reproduction in point of dura
bility and perfedtion. Such a/yftem should
embrace the equal rights bf every member
of a community, the radical HiCans ,cf na
tional prosperity, and the interests of na
tions with whom a commercial intercourse
ought {o be maintained. Hence, we should
fee the perfection of human society, man
without wars ; and even if he chose to con
centrate his authority -in an individual, or a
body of men,.putting it out of h's or their
power to trample on the multitude and
make them nothang.
The influence *>f reason alone can make
man himfelf, or induce him to aft up to the
fublimity, arili honor' of his nature.
ThiÂ« nature is progressive (beyond all doubt
to perfe&ion) like a rude plant'of.the earth,
whieh is ever improveable. And in the his
, JfOry the human mind, if we do not attend
to this principle of its natural progression to
virtue, we shall find alf dark and gloomy,
and perhaps feel ourselves secretly inclined
to refleft upon' rhe wisdom of the creative,
power, in which there can be no error.
This writer, in the application of his
theory to the business of the world, after ar
ranging jfnd duly weighing all those balan
ces of government, Jo much talked of, con
cludes that a â¢well adjujled limited monarchy
is the natural government for man. With a
grand and superb ariftocraeyi with an order
of nobility, placed between the monarch and
the people, or their representative. Such a
government (the writer supposes) would
contain within itfelf a check on,the unbrid
led strength of the people, as well asoipon
the feeret designs of ambitious usurpers of
their liberties.
But, in that complicated machine, called
fecial government, the real rights of the ma
ny have ever been facrificed to mere liypo
thefis and theory, and, other abftradt princi
ples that men have never understood or re
lished ; and like the miserable jargon called
law, has served to enslave and corrupt'
them. If man wishes to be free, he miift re
vert to simple principles, and not surrender
himfelf to be deluded with that fiftitious
fluff, that refinement of state policy, which
has ever enslaved him, and degraded his na
ture.
This writer, in advocating limited monar
chy, has not adverted to its abuses, which
have constantly prevented iil amelioration
of the human condition.
From the Western Telegra^he.
Reason suggests that in every govern
ment, theie is an absolute unlimited power, .
which naturally and origiqjlly seems to be
placed in the whole body,' wherever the
executive part of it subsists. This obser
vation holds in the body natural ;* " for
wherever we place the beginning of motion,
whethÂ»r from the head, the heart or the
animal spirits in genera], the body moves
and afts by acquiescence of all its parts."
This unlimited power placed fundamentally
in the body of a people, is what the legisla
tors of all ages have endeavoured in their
several schemes and institutions of govern
ment, to dtpofit in such hands aÂ» would
preserve the people from rapine and oppres
sion within, as well as violence from with
out. This absolute power was never con
stitutionally vested in the Roman people, as
forae writers have aflerted ; though oftenfr
hly it was, by ending a law, that no per
son should bear any magiflracy in Rome,
without the consent of the commons. Ac
cordingly we find, that the two firft con
suls were nominated by the nobles, and the
nomination was confirmed by the commons.
Their annual ele&ion for fpmÂ« time pro
duced a laudable emulation, morality was
promoted, the most cordial uniou prevailed
and not felfifh pursuits, they were deter
mined tQ. equity and right, not more by
force of laws, than by a natural propensity;
the only ftrife, the only diffentions they ex
ercised, were the public enemy. By
two principal means, valour in war, and
righteous eonduft in peace, they supported
their own reputation, and that of the com
mon weal. But the commons soon began
to feel the effefts of ill-balanced - power.
Harassed with debts, they take up arms
and leave the city in mutiny and discontent,
refufing to return, if they could not bfc ac
quitted of all their debts, and magistrates
chosen out of'their own order, whose busi
ness it should be to defend the commons
from the oppression of the nobility. TKeir
creditors compounded, and magistrates were
granted, whose persons were considered sa
cred. The commons now in their turn,
abused the nobility with a torrent of scan
dalous outrages. They gave themselves up
to precipitate aÂ£ts of vengeance, and in
order to procure it, followed blindfold the
guidance of those who encouraged them to
seek it ; followed their demagogues and
favourites, more dangerous matters than
the grandees of the senate, because impli
citly trusted, and consequently more pow
erful. They became the dupes of every
incendiary, if he were only recommended
by the merit of loudly inveighing against
their former oppressors. Thus they fuffer
ed the brutal Marius, in opposition to the
grandees, to hurt themselves more, and to
bring more disorder and desolation on the
state, than all the grandees the worst and
m'oft criminal, had done before him. But
under our benigntgovernmcnt, no constitu
tional diftinftions subsist. The poor, ho
nest, sensible man may aÂ£t in a legislative
capacity, if chosen by his fellow citizens.
Let us then remember, that our strength
and happiness consist in unanimity and na
tional affeftion, and "forbear to create a ge
neral disquietude by forming ourselves into
visionary parties.

NEW-YORK, Oftober j7,
A friend has put into our hands copies of
the papers relating to the (hip Ann and'Su
fan, Richard Weft, mailer, of New-York
lately condemned at Curacoa. The fub
ilance is as follows.
The firll paper is a copy of thfe memori
al of Stephen Kinglton of Philadelphia own
er of the (hip, to the governor and council
of that island, in which he slates, that hd
contradled with the French minister at Phi
ladelphia, to tranfpbrt to France a number
of French prisoners, who had b<?en takefi in
to Halifax by the English. For this pur.
pose he fitted'out his fliip the Governor
Hamilton of Philadelphia, and carried 243
pcrforis fafe to l'Oritnt. That he purchas
ed at Bourdeaux the fliip Ana and Susan,
and failed from thence December 8, 1706,
for Philadelphia. That he was forced by
stress of weather and heavy gales of wind, to.
put into the nearest port, and made MartiÂ»i
co, where he landed his cargo to repair his
veflel, and finding his cargo in demand there,-
he solicited and obtained permiflion to
from thence he failed for Philadelphia, and
was taken by the privateej- Le Pandour,
fapt. Garrifcin, fitted out at that island,
and commanded, as he was informed by a
citizen of the United States, contrary to
and >ll direst violation of the treaty between)
Holland and the United States,
Mr. Ivingfton proceeds to state in his
memorial, such, fafle and arguments as he
judged most proper to induce the govern
ment of the island to interfere and procure
a releafc of his ship. He mentions that the
Batavian Republic and the United States
art at peace, and that by treaty the parties
are bound to prated* each others trade in
their rgfpeftive portsâthat the proclama
tion of Viftor Hugues was issued in Februa
ry, when he was repairing his vessel at
Martimeoâand' that making that his
port was by the aft of God, for which
he could incur no liability to seizure, and
there was no decree of the French command
er prohibiting veflels failing from Britifli
ports ; and that he being altogether igno
rant of any prohibition, could not irt jus
tice be within its meaning. This memorial
was dated April nth.
On the 21ft of April Mr. Kingston made
a econd representation t& the government
or Curacoa, in which he urges that VidW
Hugues having been recalled and refufino
to obey and resign his government, could
no longer be considered as lawful governor,,
nor could his afts be valid'; and that citi
zens of the United States who might fuffer
in consequence of his orders, would claim
full compensation. He remonstrated against"
the permiflion of French privateers to be fitJ
ted out in Curacoa, to cruize against the ci
tizens of tire United States, at peace with
the Dutch republic. He mentions that the
commifllon of the Pandour dated at
Curacoa, and also that of the fchr. Char
maiite Maria, Don Pedro Martin, com
mander.
The Dutch goversraent at Curacoa, on
the 25th and 28th repjied, that they had
taken Kingston's memorials into corifidera
tion : That they were informed " that Jean
Baptifle Tierce, agent of the French repub
lic, was authorized to make condemnation
of prizes, w. >ut the concurrence of the
government of that island, and that he in
tended to exercise that power ; they there
fore had resolved to leave that business
wholly to the French agent that all the res
ponsibility might fall on him atidthofe who
had authorized him. M They however sent
the memorials to the said French agent in'
sure itliance that he would do what was
right and just. f
In consequence of this answer, the mail
ers of American veflels in Curacoa, present
ed a memorial to the governor and council,
111 which they charge some of the members,
as well ?s the French.agent, in being con
cerned in the privateers. We give this me
morial entire, as folldws :
TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR,
And t!<cgmtUmcn of til Council t/thc iJUrd of Curate*.
The memorial of the fubfenbers citizensof
the United States of America, on behalf
of-themfelres and other citizens intereiled
therein,
Respectfully Sheweth,
That they have seen with equal sorrow
and ! urprize by the answer of your honora- x
ble body, to the felicitation? of their fellow
citizen, Stephen Kingston, one' of' the sub
scribers, that " all captures are referred to
the deeifion of W. I. B. Tierce" (agent)
who is well known to the members of your
honorable body, to be concerned in the priva~
tcer; and that having all been brought in
by cruisers fitted out here, and in some
cases owned chiefly by members of your
honorable body, (in particular by Mr. Bri
on,'Mr. Van Eck, Ringhin and Mr. Steigh
lin) in violation of treaty stipulations, your
beg leave colle&ively to re
present
That the fchr. Be-tfy of Boston; late capt,
Sturgis, has been brought in here by a pi.;
rate (nowhere) not having a rÂ«mmi!lion,
and that the whole crew arerriifling ! 1
That Le Pardour, capt. Garrifcan, Â£,e
Horifon, capt. Pilote, L'Altiance, captain
Piere Margin, L'Eliza, capt. Du Pin, L'
Hiondcllt, capt. Cadet, Le Bayonefe, capt,
I. Baptifte, and Le Nottigeur, capti Lom
bard, have all been fitted out here, the lafl
having the quarter deck guns of the Dutch
frigate Ceres, laying in this port, and that
for all captures made, or that raay be made
by any of them', the United States will nat
urally expeft payment of the full value (not
what they may be facrificed for here) and
damages from the Batavian republic, and
tnat afterwards this island, or perhaps your
own honorable body may be called upon to
make good the fameâ
That by the decree of condemnation of
the brig Lady Washington and cargo, by
a tribunal at St. Domingo, received this
day, it appears that his excellency the gov
ernor of this island, " confirmed' by a cer
tificate in form" dated the 25th March lafl,
the proceedings had here thereinThat iti some inflpnees cargoes have been
taken out and fold (here, though not vet
condemned even by the agent â
That under those circurrfftances and con
federations your memorialists look forward
for ultimate redrtfs, and therefore pray
your honorable body, that the money of
every vefiel or cargo fold, or that may be
isild, be placed in fafpty to wait the ilTue of
their refpeflive appeals,your memorialists be
ing fcverally determined to appeal as hereby
they do appeal to national negociation, and
to the superior courts of jultice in Holland
and Spain, against the proceedings and de- I
â terminations had, or that may be had here I
tb such effeft against your memorialists, fo-1
Jemnly protest, that so the nioiicy may not J
be divided as prize, but as far as it may go, I
await the appropriations of ju ft ice 1
Praying the premisses to be taken into)
your consideration, yeur memorialists remain I
rcfpedt fully, &c. &c. &c.

All who have any taste for improvement
in the Machinery used in Manufa<Â£hires,
mtift be highly gratified by viewing the gin-
diflillery belonging to col. Daniel Tilling
-1 baft, late of this town, erefted at Uxbridge '
the present season, under his own dire&ion.
â1 he work is all done under one roof, and ' on
may literally Â£be said to be done by water.
The water used in the cisterns and worm *
tubs is conveyed through a log, frÂ«m a '
small but never-failing pond, raised for the
purpose of grinding the grain, and moving re P'
the other machines.âThe liquor is pumped 1
ââ  from the citterns into the ftil.'s by water 1!
the liquor in the Stills and cisterns is (lirred , ?
by w iterâand the grains, which run from Es(
the ft ills into a cistern, are pumped by wa
ter into the trough in front of the cattle.
âThe Machinery is so fimple'as to be easily
, tinderftood, and is hardly liable to get out PÂ°. n
of order. If we compare this mode of do- t ' lls
ing the buiinefe with that which is some- f onl
times used, the contrast appears very ftrik- ln
ing. The grain is generally ground by t,lis
horses, or carried Miles to Millâthe im
mense quantities of water used in the cisterns a "?
and worm-Tubs, are frequently pumped by Wl '
horses from a deep wellâthe liquor in the rc P u
ft ills and cisterns is stirred by handâthe li- ! co
quor is pumped from the cisterns into the ,
stills by handâand the grains for the cattle
are pumped by haÂ»d. In a cauntry like
this,where labour is scarce and dear, every ..
improvement in Machinery for saving labour ,! c ''
in adding so mych wealth to the nation.

" EVER fond, as I khovv you are, of ' p
what is curious, I have sent you a copy of
a remarkable prophecy, lately found in Pa
ris, and transmitted from a gentleman there, E>
to his friend in London ; who writes, that one ol
it was engraved on a slag-stone, two yards
square, in ftebrew characters, and very ele- Â°' '
gantly inlaid wjth gold. It is supposed to \\T Â«
have lain near 600 years, under an old wall,
taken down,by the late king of France, to
be rebuilt, * On removing the rubbilb from
the foundation, this stone was discovered.
" Permit me to aflure you, thkt I heard j
it from a man of very ftri& veracity and ho- J0 p

FROM AN ENGLISH PAPER. ,
A Letter from a fucccfsful Adventurer in a
lottery.
ii- sir, ' I"
a- You will not be at all surprised when I ! tl?e
tell you that I have very ill luck in the lot- .^ e 1
s, tery ; but you will flare when I further tell
Â° r you, it is because unluckily I have got a
'e considerable prize in it. I received the 2
. glad tidings of misfortune last Saturday Tt
night from your Chronicle, when, on look- f
it ing over the lift of prizes, as I was got be
hind my pipe at the club, I found that my -
tnkct was couse up a 20001. In the pride
as well as joy ofmy heart, I could not help Atf.o,
e proclaiming to the company my good luck, natty
g as I then foolifhlyi thought it, and the com- ' ri Â°">
d pany thought it too, by i n fifti, lg that I
fliould treat them that evening. Friends '"Ij"
are never so merrj-, or stay longer, than o'ck
when they have nothing to pay ; they nev- l " J S''
er care how extravagant they are on such "
an occasion. Bottle after bottle was there
fore Galled for, and that too of claret, tho' Plains
not one of us, I believe, but. had rather have vtUâ,

as I could about four in the morning-}' when r 'V'"

â  I told her the occasion of it ; but instead ,
of rejoicing as I thought she would, she
cried, " Pish, only two thousand pounds !" f ,om tl
, However, she was at last reconciled to it, fy'j'
â  takingparejto remind me, that she had, chosen ââj
the ticket herfelf, and she was all along ftire *fortfa\
it would come up a prize, bccaufe the (ium- "" cr i""
ber was an odd one. We neither of us got â¢""" L
a wink of sleep, though I was heartily in
dined for it ; for my wife kept me awake, numhr
by tell in;;, me, of this, that, and t'other, mill, in
thing, which (he wanted, and which she * r f
â¢ would bow purchase, as we could afford it. ar! fÂ° r,i
I know not how the news of my success
spread so soon among my other acqu&in
tance, except that my wife told it to every sforefui;
one fye knew,or not knew, at church. *The r 4 ll >-Â«
confequeoce was, that I had no less than Â£ rmiU >
seven very hearty friends come to dine with a*Zail

number of those hearty friends was inereaf
ed to above a dozen by supper time. It is
kiifcj in one's friends to be willing to par- I
take of one's success ; they made them
selves merry at my expence : and at part- OF '

more friends and have another jolly evening thÂ»Te u
