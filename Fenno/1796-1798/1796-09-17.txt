A very valuable Merchant Mill, p J
A DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and sundry STONE
QUARRIES to be let
I will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po
towmac, for any term not less thanfeven, r.oi mors than
eleven years, from the firll day of September next. The
>afj, mill-house is 41 by 40 feet, three stories high, built with <-p
bur- stone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two i 1
u . overlhot 18 feet water-wheels, and .Evans's machinery jQ f
complete, with every other thing proper and neceifary for anc
carrying on the bulinefs with dispatch, and at as little ex- pof<
penfe as possible, all in good order.âFrom the mill to my all 1
landing on the Potomac river, (-.vhrre craft, of any bur- kep
then may dsliver grain and take in flour) it is about 40 Â°, ut
barf, yards, and from thence by water to George-Town and | '> es
rung the City of WafhingtoH, about 3 miles, and to Alexan- sol
drii about !i miles. This situation, aided by a fufficient
capital, will command the produce of a very extensive
back country, where Urge quantities of wheat and other
grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8
to 10 miles less than to any market town upon the navi
, gation of the Potowtnac. There are on the premises a
1 ' large stone Coopers' (hip, a stone granary, and acommo-
3 C s house. At the landing aferefaid a bridge
"8"' is now building over the Potomac, which is in (rreat for
wardnefs and probably will be finithed the ensuing fall.
There are also 09 the premises, a Brewery and Distille
ry, built with stone, in them are three stills, two coppers
or boilers, with every necessary article, all new, and in
good order, and fufficieotly large to carry on the Brew
erjuind Distillery upon a very extehfiye plan. This prop
erty 1 will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my lands adjoining the premises, and along the
banks of the river, 'where craft may lead with ease and dif- *%
patch, is an i nmenfe quantity of building and founda- !
tion-ftones. Four quarries are now open, and as many j
more may be opened with ease 1 the stone taken from these ! p
quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries c
fcparately or together as may best suit. jot
5 On the top of the hill, and about 100 yards from the c
mill, is a stone Dwelling-hoUse, large enough for the ac- !r
commod'ation of a familJ: also, a kitchen, dairy, smoke- fe
V lioufc, &c. and a garden, enc ofed and in cultivation, the
foi of'which is equal in goodness to any in this state. I
aftetas wil i a lso rent this property. J â
:as 5 Adjoining to the Brewery and Distillery is a Smith s Â£
ldwill fliop, in which is a complete set of Blacksmith's tools, )(
which 1 will also rent, and if agreeabie I will hire to the
M da y tenant two negro black&r.iths, one of them is a complete 0
workman. . # a

vy-hich were built for the purpose of carrying stone : they
will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch Immediate
jnd poffcflion will be given. For terms apply to the fUbfcrib

jj Â»ThiÂ» obstinate and sanguinary conflidt, terminated
at g o'clock in the evening,
Â«' The detachment under the command of gene
ral Grenier, which had filed oft by Weilburg, did
not fall in Tvith the enemy. The detachment under
general Championet, which had filed off by Lim
burg, met the enemy at Oberfeltera. General
Championet attacked, and the enemy retreated to
Camberg, where, on their arrival, they covered the
plains with their numerous cavalry, And planted
(their infantry in ambuscade, in the wood of Wir
ges. General Championet, at the head of his in
fantry, gained poffeflion ot she heights on the light
aid left of Camberg, and general Klein, at the
head of the :zth dragoons and the 12th chasseurs,
charged the enemy's cavalry with fueh impetuosity,
that- they were totally routed with dreadful (laugh
ter.
" The battle was long and terrible. The enemy
left the field of battle covered with dead bodies.
>Thirty-five waggon loads of their wounded have
been collected, and Â£0 prifoner3 taken, among
whom is an officer of diftin&ion, and ijo borfes.
I " Alter this.-dtteatÂ« the enemy , hrrmtrht frefh
tioops into the field, apparently to t'ake their r.e
ve ;ge ; but a brigade of cavalry of reserve, having
come up to fup'port the 12th dragoons and I 2th
chasseurs, and several cannon being discharged
while their operations were suspended, induced them
to prefer a retreat. The conduit of the republican
troths,* in this battle, merits highelf eulo
. giums, and entitles them to the gratitude of their
country. General Klein distinguished himfelf in an j
eminent degree, by his courage ant) military talents.
" On the 22d; general Kleber Was informed that
the enemy had taken poll at Friedberg. He sent
orders to general: Lefebvre, who was on the left
t>awk of the Wetter, to push advanced guard to
ward Bauei nlierm and Offenheim, to follow with
his own diviiion, and to attack the enemy, but not
to attack thtm until he was informed of the arrival
of general Lefebvre. But the enemy having, in
fadt perceived tbi = manoeuvre, retreated wiih pre
cipitation, but afterwards rallied, and drew up in
order between Allenfaueibach and Rofback. They
made prodigious efforts to hinder the division of ge
neral L.efebvre to pass by Offenheim and Fouer
back ; but, in faite of their reliftance, that divi
. heights and maintained their posi
tion.
" I he advanced guard of the division under ge
neral Colaud,. commanded by adjutant-general NcyV
advanced in pursuit of the enemy as far as Ockftadt.
General Jacobin, at the head of the 43d half bri- 1
gade of infantry and the nth regiment of dra
goons, marched against Freidburg. The gates of
rfiat cit-y were forced open, in despite of a bride
fire of mufquetry and artillery ; and this column,
encouraged by its general, the adjutant-general LaÂ»
eroix, and citizen FrideKheim, aid de-camp to ge
neral Colaud; entered the town, drove the enemy
from thence, after havsng killed upwards of 200
men: a 13 pounder, and a standard, N after having
been taken and retaken several times,remained with
our troops.
" T lie division of general Colaud and general
Boqnard having arrived, the enemj found them
selves preffrd on both flanks, and were,compelled
to letreat. General Richepaufe and adjutant-gene
. nil Ney, purfned them until night. Beside the
piere of artillery taken at Friedberg, 2 others were
taken on the plain before that town. The loss of
enemy, in, the affairs of, the 2lft and 22d, may be
cilirÃated at 2000 men, of whom 500, including 8
I <fr"ei's, have been made prifoneis.
" We have loft the citizen Rouilly, aid de camp

with the Ms of some men killej and
twenty prisoners, of whom o.ie wnf a captain.
" On the 23d, the army halted to wait fftr pro

inverted the fort of Konigjlein.
" On the 24tk, the army was again on its march.
1 hÂ» wing passed the mountains and advanced
to the plain of the Mein. The left wiVg after ha

were summoned to open the gates of that city.

it, so that the day was passed is deputations from

But as the enemy seemed difpoftd to pecupy the

if he could. The emigrants disbanded ; they flew,
but were he'mmed in 011 all fides; they,endeavoured
to pass by the advanced guard of the French troops,
but the peasants, armed wiih pick-axes aod forks,
