STATE PAPER.
DECLARATION.
HIS Majesty's most" benevolent endea
vours -toTcftore to his People the blessings
of iecure and honorable Peace, again re
peated without fucccfs, have again de
uionftr. ted oeyondthepofiibility of doubt
the determined and perflrvering hostility
of the Government of France, in whose
unprovoked aggression the war originated,
boundlefs and destructive
ambition it is still prolonged. And while
kyr Uie course of these transaCtions, con
rtiuueJ proofs have been afforded, to all
his majesty's faithful subjeCts, of his anx
ious and unremitting solicitude for their
welfare, they cannot, at the fame time,
have failed to recognize, in the uniform
eonduCt of the enemy, the spirit by which
the councils of France are still actuated,
and the objects to which they are direct
ed.
His Majesty could not but feel how
much the means of Peace had been oh
ftryCted by the many additional difficul
ties which his enemies had so repeatedly
thrown in the way of every negociation.
Nevertheless, on the very firft appearance
of circumstances in some degree favora
ble to the interests of humanity, the fame
ardent desire for the ease and happiness
of his subjeCts, induced his Majesty to
renew his overtures for terminating the
caloaiixies of Warâthus availing him
fclf of every opening which could in .uiy
manner lead to lecure an honorable peace,
and confuting equally the wishes of his
own heart, and the principles by* which
his conduct has invariably been guided.
New objeCts were immediately inter
posed by those who still directed the eoun
cils of France, and who, amidst the ge
neral desire for peace which they could
not at that time openly clifclaim, still re
tained the power of fruftrating the wish
es of their own country, of counteract
ing his Majesty's benevolent intentions,
and of obstruCting that result which was
so neceflary for the happiness of both na
tions. Difficulties of Form were studi
ously createdâmodes of negociation were
insisted upon, the most inconliftent with
*hcir own eonduCt in ever pother instance;
the fame spirit appeared in every other
step which was taken by themâand
while die moQ; unwarranted insinuations
were thrown out, and the uioft unfound
ed Reproaches brought forward, the esta
blished customs and usages, which have
long prevailed in Europe, were purposely
departed from, even m thc.Hmplcft a Â£t3.
which were to be done on their part for
the renewal of the negociations All
these things his Majesty determined to
disregard ; not as being insensible of their
purport and tendency, nor unmindful of
the importance of these points in the
public intercourse of great and independ
ent nations, but resolving to defeat the
object of these artifices, and to fuffer no
â¢iubordinate or inferior consideration to
impede, oh his part, the difcuffian of
the weighty and extensive interns on
which the termination of the war rrtuft
neceflarily depend.
He directed his Minister to repair tq
France, Furnifhecl with the most ample
powers, and instruCted to communicate
at once an explicit and detailed Proposal
and Plan of Peace, reduced into the ftiape
of a regular Treaty, just and moderate
in its principles, embracing all the inte
rests concerned, and extending to every
subjeCt connected with the restoration o(
public tranquility. The communication
of this paper, delivered in the very firft
conference, was accompanied-with ftrch
explanations as fully stated and detailed
theutmoft Actent of his Majesty's views,
and at the fame time gave ajjaplp room
for the examination of every disputed
point, .for mutual Arrangement and con
cession, and for reciprocal facilities, aris
ing out of the progress of fair discussion.
To this proceeding, open and liberal
beyond example, the eonduCt of his ma
jesty's enemies opposes the most striking
contrast. From them no counter-pro
jeCt has ever yet been obtainedâno State
ment of the extent or nature of the Con
ditions on which-they would conclude a
ny peace with these kingdoms. Their
prptenfions have always been brought,
<brjrar:i either as detached or as prelimi
nary-points, distinCt from the main ob
jeCtof negociation, and accompanied, in
every instance, with an express reserve of
farther and unexplained demands.
Tk. ; points which, in pursuance of this
fyftera, the plenipotentiaries of the enemy
propofedfor separate discussion in their firft
conferences with his majesty's minister,
were at once frivolous aud wfFenfiveânone
of them productive of any solid advantages
to France, but all calculated to raifr new
obftacies in the way of peace. And to
the demands were foot? added another, in its
form 'HiprecedentL-d, and in its substance, i
extravagant, and fuel* as could originate !
only in the most determined and inveterate
hostility. The principle of mutual com.
penfation, before cxprefsly admitted by a
common consent, as the just and equitable
basis of negociation, was now dlfclaimed
every idea of moderation, every appearance
â  ofjuftice, was disregardedâand a concef
. fion was required from hil majesty's ple
; nipotentiary, as a preliminary and indifpen- i
T fable condition of liegociation, which must
at once have superseded all the objects, and j
precluded all the means of treating. France, \
, after incorporating with ber own domin- 1
; ions so large a proportion of her conquests, <
, and affeCting to have deprived herfelf by her t
own internal reflations, of thÂ« power of t
alienating these valuable additions of tern- I
1 tory, did not fcrupie to demand ftom
. his majesty the abfolilte and unconditional t
r surrender of all that the energy of his peo- c
pie and the valour of his fleets and armiefc, 1
' have conquered in the preftnt war, either 1
1 from France, or her allies,
i She required that the power of Great- r
( Britain should be confined within its former r
limits, at the very moment when her own t
dominion was extended to a degree almost r
uuparalleled in history. She insisted, that, c
in proportion to the inereafe of danger, the c
means of resistance fnould be diminished ; t
_ and that, his majesty should Â£ive up, without i
T compensation, and into the hands of his-e- a
nemies, the necessary defences of his possess- i<
ions, and the future fafeguards of his v
; pi r e- Nc>r was even this dtmand brought (
_ forward as constituting the terms of (ieace, r
, b ut the price of negociation ;as the condi- a
tion on which alone his majesty was to be a
allowed to learn what furthej unexplained t
) denvindj, .were fti'll reserved, and to what t
; greater facri&ces these unprecedented con- n
ceSions of honour and fafety were to lead. f
Whatever were the imprefiions which si
such a proceeding created, they did not in- 1
duce the JViiig abruptly to- preclude the t
; means of negociation. Tu rejecting with- p
( out a moment's hesitation, a demand, which it<
could Wave been- made for no other reason p
than because it was inadmissible, his majef- ;
ty, from the fixed resolution to avail himfelf b
â¢ of every chance of bringing the negociation c
to a favourable iffne, directed that an open- : d
ing should still be left for treating on rear
fonable and equal 'grounds, such as might n
become the dignity of his crown, and the h
rank and station in Europe in which it lias c
pleased Divine Providence to place, the p
British nation. j y
This temperate and conciliatory conduCt g
was flrongly expressive of the benevolence a;
of his majesty's intentions : and it appeared g
for some time to have prepared the way for ir
that result which has been the uniform ob- b
jeCt of all his measures. Two months elapf- o
ed after his majesty had unequivocally and t(
definitively refufed to comply with the un. si
reasonable and extravagant preliminary tl
[ which had been demanded by his enefrues.
During all that time the negociation was p
continued open, the conferences were regu- d
larly held, and the demand thus explicitly, b
rejected by one pal ty was never once renew- al
ed by the other. It was not only abandon- ti
ed ; it was dlfclaimed ; assurances were giv- T
en in direiSt contrauiCtion to it. I'rouiiLs al
* were continually repeated, that his majesty's h
explicit and detailed proposals should at tl
I length be by that which could a- p
i lone evince a real disposition to negoeiate rr
with iincerity, by the delivery of a counter- ai
- projeCt of a nature tending to facilitate tl
conclusion of peace ; and the long delaykof tt
; the French government in executing these ai
- promises were excused and accounted for by cl
an unequivocal declaration, that France t:
( was concerting with her allies foV those, fa- si
crifices on their pact, whicK might afford the m
means of proceeding in the negociation.â ir
Week after week passed over in the repeti- o;
t(on of these "solemn engagements on the tc
part of his majesty's enemies. His desire ; e:
peace induced him to wait for their'
completion, with an anxiety proportioned tl
1 to the importance of the objeCt ; nor was tl
: it much to expeCt, that his minister fhonld ei
â  at length be informed what was the extent t<
and nature of the conditions on which his w
enemies were disposed to terminate the war. w
It was in this stage of the bufir.efs that, ai
on the ilth of September, the appointpient d
of new plenipotentiaries was announced on fc
; the part of France under a formal promise as
. that their arrival should facilitate and cxpe- f<
dite the work of peace. i e i
To renew, in a shape still more offensive ; cl
than before, the inadmissible demand so long ! ir.
before brought forward, and so long a ban- T
doned, was the firft aCt of these meifengers ts
of peace. And such was now the midif- re
guifed impatience of the king's enemies to b
terminate all treaty, and to exclude all prof- oi
peCt of accommodation, that even the cor.- tl
tinuance of the king's plenipotentiary at the tl
appointed place nf negociation, was mase h.
by them to depend on his immediate com- ai
pliance with a condition which his court had tl
two months before, explicitly refufed, and fa
concerning which no further discussion had a]
since occurred. His reply was filch as tl.- w
occasion required : and he immediately re- o!
eeived a politive and Written order to depart d
from France. , c ,
The subsequent conduCt of his majesty's tl
enemies has aggravated even this proceed- c<
ing, and added frtfh in'fult Jo this unexam- tc
pled outrage The infurmouiitable ohita- tc
cles which they threw in the way of peace tj
were accompanied with an ostentatious pro- ai
session of the most pacific dispositions. In fr
cutting off the means of negociation, they al
still pretended to retain the strongest desire 1q
to negociate : in ordering the king's mifi- it
ifter to quit their country they profefTed the
hope of his immediate return to it ; and in
renewing their former inadmissible aud re
jeCted demand, they declared their confi- b<
dent rfxpef'.ation of a speedy and favorable
anfvver. iet before any answer could ar- ec
rive, they publiflied a declaration, annonn- S
cing to their country, the departure of the L
king's minister, as.d attempting, as in every ai
ts former in (lane?, (o ascribe lotjieconduct of
e, â¢ Great-Britain the difappointrnent of the
te j general wtfh for peace, and tl>e renew?.' of
te j all the enlamities'of war. I>e fnnie at
n - J tempt has- been prolonged in
a j communications, equally in fidious and iiiu
le fory, by which they have obviouÃy ipteil
- ded ta furnifh the colour andemply pretence
ie of a wish for peace, while they have still
f- ftudiuufly and obfliwately peril fled in err.d
-- ing every step which could lead to the fac
i- cess of any negoci'atiori, have continued to
ft inlittor. the fame inadmiliible and extrava
d gÂ»nf preliminary, and,have uniformly with
i, held ad explanation, eirher on the partica
l- hÂ»rs of the proposals of peace so long Gn?e
j, delivered "by his raajeily'i mitnfters, or any
r other terms on which they were fWrftfelVt*
>f ready to conclude : and ..this M the "vain
hÂ»pe, that it Wtildbe poftfble by'any arti
li lice to difgqife the truth of these' tranfac
al tions, or that any exercise ef poirer, hovv
>- ever despotic, could prevent such fafls from
s, being known, felt, and understood, e*en in
r France itfelf.
"1 o France, to Europe, and the world, ft
lhn ! be manifeft, that the French govern
r mem ( while they persist in their present fcn
n timents) leave his majesty without an alter
it native, unless he were prepared to furren
., der and facrifke to the undisguised ambition i
e of his enemies, the of his crown, and
; the fafety of his dominions. It must be man
it ifeft, that, instead of showing on their part
â¢- any inclination to meet his majesty's pacif- ]
! lc overtures on any moderate terms, tbey ne- ,
i- ver brought themselves to slate any terms
t (oowevtr exorbitant J.Â»ou which they weie .
, ready to eonclude peace. They have asked ,
- as a preliminary (and in the form ttie mod
e arrogant and offenfive) eoncefSons which j
d the comparative situation of the two coun
t tries would have rendered extravagant in a- j
-j ny stage of negotiation ; which were direS:- ]

- | power of afterwards a<xmnuUhigj"<,,rHint '
i i to time, frefh demands,,

- On the other hand, t^e,-.terms projsflTed
f by his majesty have been stated in the nroft
i clear, open, and unequivocal manner. The
- difcuflion of all the points to which they
- i elate, or of any others which thr enemy
t might bring forward as the terms of peace, i
e has been on his majesty's part, npeatedly
s called for, as often promised by tie French
e plenipotentiaries, but to this day nas never
j yet been obtained. The rupture Â«f the ne
t gociation is not therefore to be ascribed to
e any pretensions (however inadmifjble) ur-
1 ged as the price of peace ; nor to any ulti- j
r mate difference on terms, however eSorbJtant;
- but to the evident and fixed detarnination ti
- of the enemy .to prolong the cmteft, and 1
1 to pursue, at all hazards, their hostile de
r signs against the profperi'ty and fafety of (t
r these kingdoms.
While this determination continues to
s prevail his Majesty's earned wishes and en- u
- deavours to-reftore peace to his fubjedls must a
r be fruitlefs. Bui hisftwtimgets remain un- A
- altered. He looks with anxioits expefta- l a
- t:on to the moment when the government of r t
- France may frnjw a difpofitic&h and spirit in j,
s any degree correfpoÃding to his own. And
s he renews, even now, and before all Eur* P e
t the solemn declaration; that in spite of rc
- peated provocations, and at the very mo- I
; ment when his claims had been ftrengtherted
- and confined by that frerti success, which by
: the blefiiug of Providence, has recently at
f tended his arms, he is yet ready (if the cal
z amities of vVar can now be cloled) to con
: elude pe.ice on the fame, modfrate and equi-
- table principles and whieh he has be- -
- fore proposed: the rejec\ion of such terms
: mull now, more than ever, demonftrace the o
- implacable animosity and infac'abie ambition 1'
- of those with whom he has to contend, and I
: ! to them alone must the future consequences
tr of the prolongation of the War be ascribed. p
r It such unhappily is the fpii it by which '
1 they are ftifl aftuated, his majesty can nei-
s ther hesitate as-to the principles of-his own g
1 conduft, nor doubt the fentiments'and de- e
t termination of his people. He will not be '
s wanting to them, mid he is confident they
. will not be waging tor.themfelveft' He has 8
, an anxious, but a sacred and indispensable u
t duty to fulfil: He.wiJMifcharge ifHvkh re- tl

; as he must regret the cofltiimimcc Â«f .a War P

- These it is the firft objeft of his life to main- j

Â«d a refolutien to the effeil : cu
" Kefolved, that the committee of commerce r

Y law pasTed in 1796, for the relief of perfans /
I son&ned l'or debt, whether' it were intended to ' n
3 operate in lavor of persons impr'.foned at tbu wi
s suit ot the United States. They accordingly th
s addressed the attorney general noon the fubjeft, Q f
who was of opinion it did. Some IegÂ»l deci- g (
'' fions having, the committee underffood, been
e differently made, they thought it best, at pref

- but to decline affording any relief to the A
[1 tioner, and wait the ifiuÂ» of* a determination of le;
. the fnprenie court ; ss, if that deeifion (hould til

and a committee sf three appointee'.
e Mr. Harper moved that the Committee of the
, whole be difebarged from, a further ccmfidera
tion.ot the letter from the ft-eretsry <>f fiate^
13 inclosing a report of the oireiiW a? the mint,
;â  fnpgefting the expediency of forae ilteratioDS

depolitors, in nider that it might he referred ts
the rorumiitee nf ways an 2 mea-.ns. re he
fnppefcd it w s intended to appropriate a film
. {of money for the purpr fe-of j>jrehat>E<> bullion, â 
it was proper the bn'Jncls ihotd i go .to that com
e ! inittee. ,
Mr< Nicholas -u i(htd, before nny thiri"- was f
e done in the bufinel's, to know th.e iflue of th<
_ bill at present pending 'relative to foreign coia,
, If ii (hould be disagreed to, and the circulation
~ of foreign coin were to be stopped, he fuppof'
â¢ |ed t would b B(? JifCefCity so*" appropriating
money for the purehafc of bullion.
Mr. Harper thought thit, notwithft-,ndijig
; the bill whu.ijihe tÂ»etttkrosn alluded to, wai
. not yet-cjfl^ecU ypoÂ»Â» he law no reafins why
the course he .prop..fed fliould ni.t bo taken,
Cnce the camm.ttee of ways and means Could
in the mean time be turning its attention to the
without reporting upon it, until he
- bill now in itsp'flage, was decided upon.
1 Mr. Gallatin did not think it proper that this
business ftiotliU' go to the committee of wiys .md
means at prefervt. The honfe ought firfl to ih
cide whether they will make an appropriate - .
for this ohjefl. If they so delerrnii.et', the j
yf twirfe, be referred "> t
o^ means. It was proper
t alio, that an cuqyiry fhwld be made (which i.c
understood it wii the intention ef agentlerain
tobring forward) whyjhe treasury department
had not carried the fortfre| law into execution,
which required except Spanifli
| dollars and parts thereof, which came into their
1 hands, to be re-coined before it was re-iflfued
Mr. G. said there would be the fame propriety"
: in fending a proposition for the rasing ait array
to the i-Â»mmittce of ways and means, as there
would be in lending the letter and report in
r question.
Mr. Harper knew the house must deter
mine whether any apprepriation fliould be
made for the obje& in question, or not; but
it wzs foe the committee of ways and means
r to fay how the bnfinefs could heft be done,
and whether there was money enoughjn the
treasury for the purpose, or whether
would be necessary to effedt it. But if the
fubjeift were to be difcuftsd, before any re
port was had from the committee of ways
aÂ«d meant, it wouldJbp' used as a strong ar
gument--againit the measure, that there
would be need of additional taxes to tueet
the appropriation.
Mr. J. Wiilams wiftied, before they took
any step in this business, to know the fate
of the bill now in the Senate with refpeft tÂ®
foreign coin.
The motion was put and negatived with
out-a division.
Mr. Havens submitted a resolution to the
following efledt:
" Refoived, That the Secretary of the
Treasury be directed to lay before this house
fuc'ti information as it is in his power to give
refpeSiug the execution of the 3d fedh'on of
the aft to regulate fpreign coin aud for other
purposes, passed. Feb. 9, 1793, and which
directs that foreign gold and iilver coin, cx*
cept Spanifh.4uJlQri and parts therof, which
fliall be,rcceiv);<J,in payment by the United
States, pfjKjrjhe coining of gold & silver ooin
of the United States,
be ' n S ""e-iffued into cir
culation, be coified anew ; and if thid part
of the law has not been executed, to explain
the causes which prevented its execution."
Some objeftions were made to this resolu
tion ; a motion was made by Mr. Kittera
to amend it, by striking out all which sol-:
lows " Feb. 9. 1793 ; but after a few de
juJt'ofv remark's-upon this motion, it wasfu
perfe'ned by OSc made by, Mr. Gordon to
postpone the till-tomorrow, which
was carried
On motion of Mr. j. Williams, the house
refoived itfelf into a committee of the whole
on the? bill fdf the relief of Nova Scotia and
Canadian Refugees, Mr. De it in the chair.
The bill Was read, and several amenduiient9
introduced into it'j the principal of which
were, one to reduce the age of persons enti
tled to land from 18 to 14. years at the time
of their entering the ttrritory of the United
States ; the other, to extend the allowance
to female as wel,l asmale refugees, who were
of that age at the time of their emigration.
At length the committee rose, and asked
leave to lit again, but leave was rcfufed by
the house, 2nd the bill was re-committed,
in order to make it conformable to the a
mendments.
Mr. Livingflon reported a bill authoriz
ing the payment of certain ftims of money to
the daughters of the late CwUnt de Grade,
which was twice read, and ccwnmitted for

New-Theatre,
December 11, 1797-
'j '"pHE Managjrs particularly request the con-
I. currence of the public in the abolition of a;
custom, which has hitherto obtained, of givirjg a
â Sj way or difpoling of RETURN CHECKS at the
a- Theatre.
Ed They are aware that gentlemen are unconfuidus
er of any wrong done to the interest of the inftitu
a. tion by this practice, from a general, though rajf
ir. taken idea that Checks are the representatives of a
right to so many feats in tke Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at wiU ;
when in fa<si, they were never intended more
than tokens by which the Door-keepers arevcnablcd
to afc&rtaia with the least trouble to ttiÂ£f>qrtj?sÂ£hkt
they tbemfel'ves have been before in the Jfheatre, or
p;iid for their admiirion.
Independent of the injury the Managers fuflain,
such a pra<slice encourages a croud of idle hoys and
other disorderly ptrfons to surround the doers of
the Theatre, to the aoi ruption of their moral* and
Y" the great annoyance of the Audience.
c f' It has also been rfaefomxe of of no in- j
magnitude; one is, that famctimea
a very improper company is by these admit? '
ted ; and the other, that owin A to Chock? pacing ;
itjto diftt>neU hands, they have been l'requenaly
ar ! counterfeited to a large amount f<Jr t|ie purpofesof
I Sale.
w 1 This statement will, it isrefpedfully hoped, in
j duce the Public to discourage such a traffic : and
i the exertions of the Managers will, if thus afliltcd,
;r, ehfily ppove adequate to its entire abolition.
