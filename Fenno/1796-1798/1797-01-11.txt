BOTZEN, Ofiober 22.
The troops who are in Mantua with field-marlhal
Wurmfur, amount to JJ,OOO men. The want of
provifitins in that fortrefs becomes more alarming
to the fnldiers, among whom contagious fevers
have unfortunately made (hocking havock. The
furroundiag diftnAs are totally exhauftcd. The
French are not provided with a fufficicnt heavy
ordnance. General Alvinzi ilrains every nerve to
colleA a force fufficient to relieve Mantua.
HAGUE, Oft. 2;.
At present the basis of the conftitutien of eur
republic has been unanimously agreed upon by the
committee of constitution (except only one diflcnt
of citizen Kafteele of Haarlem.) The unity of
the Seven Provinces in regard of their exterior po
litical concerns is therein admitted, but not unity
refprfting finances and the confel'dation of debts,
since some Provinces as Holland and Zealand are
heavily in debt, and other provinces not. The le
gislative body is divided inta two councils, the one
of which cenfifts of 30 and the other of 60 mem
bers. The dirediory or council of state or execu
tive will consist of 7 members (like in the formsr
government) representing the 7 provinces.
This plan of our new constitution will be read
in the Convention on the Ift November, and the
members will be allowed 14 days for its considera
tion. Then they will have to accept or to rcjeft it
in a mass. If rejefled ten new members will be
added to the 21 who have hitherto fat on this com
miflian. These will have to make another report
within 4 weeks, and the discussion will then recom
mence and last perhaps 3or 4 months. The Snal
farftion of the people in their primary aflemblire
is then to ensue.
Very animated debates are expefled between the
parties of Fcderalilts and the Unitaries, as now
called.
HAGUE, OSober 29.
The day before yesterday a letter was read in the
convention, from Batavia, dating that the English
had taken all our fettletnents in the Eaft-Indics,
except Batavia and two fettlenaents in Java.
PARIS, October 16.
Suicides happen now daily here, in particular
amonglt thofc who depend on their rents of the
poblic funds, and who are reduced to a miserable
fltuatian. The dbefore yesterday a mother with
a beautiful dauglttei of 18 years, precipitated
themselves ant of the 4th (lory of their dwellings.
The mother was fond dead on the spot, and the
daughter furvVed her only a few hours. Meafurej
are however taken at the treasury, to begin with
the paymtnt of a fourth part of these rents. [
Citizen Quatrcmere Dmfional, Lieutenant Co
lonel iÂ» the service of the Batavian republic, has
invented a machine by means of which blind per
sons can spin hemp. The'invention is so far im
proved upon, that our soldiers also who loft their
arms and legs in the army, may do the fame work.

The directory hastens to communicate to yoi)
the TOiKtary operations on the easterly frontiers.
The result is one of the most decisive in the course
of this campaign, and thefuccefi alore could fe
curethe numerous victories of our armies on the
Rhine, and with precifiou decide, which party
would "finally reap the fruits and advantages of fa
many great efforts. The army of the Rhine and
Mofell*., which by the retreat of general Jourdan's,
found her left wing exposed, when before the gates
of Munich, and afterwards fiirroanded from all
parts, has returned in the order to the bor
ders of the Rhine. The fame army has not only
been fuffered to be eftablilhecf but also aiinnyed the
enemy by every occasion, and fnuglit their way
through every difficulty, and finalfy penetrated in
two columm as far as Huningen and Frybourg, af
ter a glorious victory (at Schaffenried) whereby
they made 5000 piifouers and took 20 cannonâ
having thus made a campaign at the expence of the
\ enemy ; fepatated most all princes of the empire
from the coalition, and favored by a vigorous di
version the iÃvafion of Italy. The fame army re
mains matter of the Brifgau, of all the bridges up
on the Rhine, of all the roads and pipes whiih con
duct to the enemy'B territories. Posterity will re
cord this remarkable retreat amongst the most fa
mous actions that have been ever executed. It
does the greatest honour to the army of the Rhine
and Mvfelle, and to their modest generals. The
enemy is after hit hazardcus motions, in such a
confufion, that it is permitted to us to expect yet
frelh and very favourable advantages.

dated Gibraltar Bay, O&ober 9.
" I received your letter upon our arrival at this

narrow escape from Spanish captivity. We have

41 hours at quarters. Had they come up great

very is well known, and I heard him fay, that they
fhoiild purchase the fiiipe very dear. We loft two
of the trartfports which we had under convoy, and
had it not been for the superior failing of our (hips,
they mull have taken or funk us all. When we got
into this bay, their van (hips were but three or four
miles distant, and the body of their fleet not far
off."
The Britifli naval force in -the Mediterranean

tion for a vessel captured by some of onr (hips of

Our government offered his excellency a frigate tp
convey him home, which he declined, and he has
hired a neutral vessel for that purpose.
A neutral vessel, sent into Harwich, by one of
admiral Duncan's cruiiers, left AmUerdam on Sa
turday last, has brought advice that the French ar
my of the Sambre and Meufe had advanced to
wards the Lahn, and were prepaiing to attack the
Aultrians, stationed is the vicinity of Neuwied and
Ehrenbreitftein. Their polts extended along the
Mumerbach, and to Dredorff in the Wederwalt.
Many (kirmiflies had taken place in the Hundfruck,
terminating generally to the advantage of the Au

tl.emfelves within a (hort diftanee of Keyferflau

publicans, comprising thegarrifon of Landau, and
l'everal battalions of national guards, had obliged
general Hotze to retire into the neighborhood" of
Spires. The archduke Charles had removed his
head-quarters to Baden, and withdrawn his forces
from the neighborhood of Kehl, with which Mo

Citizen Dirictors,
We have given you an account, some days ago,
of the arrival' of one part of the patriots of the
ifltnd of Corika, who were of those delhned to the
expedition ; and likewise of the movements which
the republicans of the inner tenitory have made,
and finally of the departure of general Gentili,
with the rett of the emigrants of Corsica, which
had united themselves at Livorne.
To-day we make hade to give you an account
of the happy intelligence, that the Englilh finding
it impoflible for them to stay any longer upon the
island, were forced to evacuate it. This intelli
gence, besides tlie treaty wittf Spain, the captiite
of Livorne, the embargo of the Genoese sea ports
againlt the Englilh, and the energy of the republi
cans who went to Corsica, willseftore the commerce
of Matfeillcs and the southern parts of France to
its original splendor and prosperity. May those
inhabitants of Corsica who had the misfortune of
being misguided by the Engli(h, serve those for an
example who may yet be tempted to tely up6n
those ifianders.
SALICETTI & GARRA^U.
General Gentili wrote, likewise, Â»n tlie 15th
ultimo, to the commiflaries of the government,
Saliaetti and Garrau, and gave them intelligence
that the Englilh had avacuated Corsica, to which
the landing ef a great partyof Corficansconlributed
very much.
The daily officii! Jbetl of the Journal des Defenfeurt
de la Patrie contains {he following :
ARMY OF ITALY.
The calutjuiies which are so of t i fyread abroad
and were so often refuted by the vidtoiies of ge
neral Buonaparte are only toys of the agitators and
others who mean to deceive the crednhus.
The enemies of the Republic, the Royalii'S and
the adherents of anarchy, rally their forces ant] u.
nite their endeavors to make those believe, what
may disturb thegood citizens ami the trire friends
of government. The new reports of a sally of
Wurmfer with part of his army in Mantua and his
pretended advantages over the Yepublicans are of
this kind. Italy fees Buonaparte her conqueror,
ever glorious, and (he will fee Wurmfer and his
army prisoners of war. The expedition to Corsica
(hews fufficiently the superiority of the force he
commands.
General Bournonville has f*nt an Jccount from
the head quarters at dated the 23d in
stant, of the' crofting of the Rhine, which the
Auftrians attempted on the 22 irritant at night, at
Neuwied, &c. (This account agrees in the whole
with that of the French already pnhlilhed ) Among
other artisies it is that all of the enemy who
eroded the Rhine at Neudorff wrt,e eitlser killed,
taken prisoners or drowned. On the left wing of
the Rhine were left in our liaod3 1,000 prisoners,
400 whereof were wounded. Those that were
drowned are edimated to be 3 or 400, and the lofj
r<r the.enemy on the'right wing must have been
extraordinary great, as they received from ths
bridge battery a mod aftonidiing site. The troops
under general Kleber and Grenier have diliinguilh
ed themselves mod wonderfully.
From Cadiz we learn that on the Bth instant,
the Spanish admiral Langara has taken some En
glidi men of war in the Mediterranean sea, and
that if he had had orders of hr.Qility 24 hours
sooner, he could have taken the" English division of
admiia! Maim, confuting of five (hips of ajie line,
with a convoy of 4000 men. In Eltremadura will
be raised a Spanish amp confiding of 60,000 men.
The Englidi (hips which admiral Lan'grra has
taken are one of 50 cannon anu 2 eorv; es. The
English men of war whicih hto k,v up ihe port as
Carthageua are returned to Gibraltar.
\ ederday the Council of Five Hundred laid an
embargo. No (hips wherein arv found EngJilh goodi
are to he fuffered to enter any of the French-ports.
On the 25th indant the Council of rectived
a riieffage from the Directory, whereupon it formed
itfelf into a secret commiitee. It is alTerted that
this mrflage relates to a peace with Portugal.
I lie celTation of arms with Modena was didurb

go and visit a French commidary in Seandiano.

In fine general Buonaparte fays in a manifefto,
that he published, that the Duke's governmeut
has caused the French to be liated by the Modena
people, Instead of paying the contributions, the
Duke has given hit money to the enemy, and all
those are now declared as enemies to the French,
who (hall make an attack upon the property and
the rights of the inhabitants of Modena and Reg

On the 7th instant, our troops took possession of

On the 12th instant the great admiral, or cap
tain Pacha, made his entrance in the channel. In
the middle of his fleet weren be seen the two Mal
tese cor fair fliips, which he had conquered. Their
flags were reversed, and their men laid in irons.
As soon as the captain Pacha came ashore, he was
received with the loudell acclamations of joy by
the people. He went to the Seraglio, where he
obtained audience of the grand fignior, and was reÂ»
ceived in a flattering manner. The enemies of the
captain Pacha, did net like this, because they are
afraid that he will be made prime minider or grand
vizier. The fultari desired him to give an account
of the adion of both the Maltcfe corsairs, and dif
miifed him moll graciously.
Among the prisoners of the M?Jtefe are one

A writer in the New-York Argus, denies (and bis
publication is copied mto the Aurora) that men with- He
cut talents er principles bear away the palm of public Pr
honors, which had been afTerted in the Minerva of Mr. Â«fb
Webster. Where such men get the palm, let others
tell. Neither in Philadelphia, nor in the County, wiir
Mr. Webster look for or find infUnccs to illustrate his
a (lemon. Men of talent 6, principle, and unspotted
mercantile honor are eleflcd for the City and County, rr
as every one knows. The writer is also angry with ,
Mr. Webier for defaming our country and its public
men; What ajoke I Greenieaf and Baehe are (hocked te
at scurrility,âat opinions discrediting our nation ;at dc
slander on public men !! ! Ytt that very paper charges la
the gove-nment with fomenting the whisky rebellion n!
Is this no slander ! \bufe of the PennfylvauL afTem- Q |
â blyi, and of the President, is nothingâit is nothing for j t
the Aurora to insult the House of Rep' efentatives of
the United States when they went in ,procession with P'
the answer to the President's fpcech. This and muck rr
more ol the kind, in the Aurora, indeed goes for no- bi
thing. It makes a very sorry and mean figure every- ci
where, except possibly in the account of fccrct ferviee
money, where Tom Paine's salary for writing againll [,
the President may be charged with that to the Printer q
for calumniating him. 1
The governor of MafTachufetts, in his thanks
giving proclamation, fugsjells a solemn prayer to
God for the success of the nations viho are contending Â®
for liberty. This sentiment was published in all the u
gazettes withoot a comment, and 1 could not but r
be struck with its appearance even in a Knoxville f
gazette (state of TeneFee). I
Foreigners, on reading this article, could nÂ«t t
fail to understand that the people of Maflacliufetts 11
are ipraying heartily, with their governor, for the
pom pope, the Venetians, the king of Sardinia, and a
(or the dukepf Tufcany, whose independent fov {
ereignty w*s trampled upon, and his sea-port town, t
Leghorn, seizedâhis commandant anefted, and t
the whole injury aggravated by the insult of a letter
Â£om the general. The people of MafTachufetts, |
who have lately gained independence, will set a
proper value upon that of other countries, and (
therefore every Italian reader would fay, this is t
very kind to pray for us. Ihe Italian llates, he 1
would add. arc groaning under the yoke of a con- t
qaeror, and any attempt to defend themselves is ;
threatened with death, the cities to be burned and
the peÂ»ple killed. ,
But he would be astonished if he was told, the â¢ ;
governor probably meant the French, and not their
enemies. They contending for liberty !he would
exclaim, that opinion is given up every where.
Does French liberty require that they should con
/ cjuer their neighbours, burn their towns, and ravage
and despoil the faireft regions of the earth. Ame.
Â« rica is the country of morals, of equitable and bene
volent sentiments towards all nations ; if your own
independence is dear to yon, Americans, you can
not wish other* may l#fe that jewel.
If it is answered that liberty within France is the
matter contended for, it may be retorted why dÂ»
net the French enjoy it then Becoming con
querors is not the way to become freeâit sets up a
military despotism. A nation of Writers is ana
lion of slaves.
French liberty and their cause of liberty aie
words of impoliii. il and deceit, which are now
exploded. Even here, whete multitudes yielded
willingly to their feelings, it is too late te revive
them even in party publications. But to intro
duce them solemnly into an address to the Al
mighty, is too much. What fort of liberty that
is we are to pray may be continued to the French,
their own governors have told us. Briffet repie-
V fentsit as thewildcrt, wickedest, and most dreadful !
dcfpotil'tn that ever scourged mankind. Gre,;oire
tells the convention," the greatett tneiny of Fiance
could not wifo the country to be going fatter to
deftrufiion than it seems to be by crimes, cruellies
and follies." The debates of the convention afford
" volumes of confirmation. ,
Now, if they chnfe to call this libertyâif this
he what they are contending for, it is really a pity
they fhauld have to contend for it, because I can
not fee why the poor Italians should objei. to the
French er joying the tranfeendent bappir.e.s of-. lien
liberty The liberty of putting all property into
.rquifitior, !o that no man was the owner of any
U,i, -hat a connmifJary or a committee man wrfh*)
to own, may Wt others. Americans do not like de
such a principle For prote&iujj property. Tro drag fa
every youngraan ratothewar in order to extend the
terrible Republic to the Rhine, or to set up sub ft ate s
beyond the is a very different tiling from q,
forcing the people to defend their Â«wn cowntry ins
against the duke of Brunfwick. This may be called th<
liberty by those who incline to be oddâit is how- tei
ever the liberty of a camp-Â»-fu< h as the slaves of to "
conquering *'efpots everywhere enjoy.
Judice is one of our'rights and privileges. In
France a man's head was secured on his shoulders '
by no legal protedion. Juries might stop the trial
of a person accused at any stage. Justice thers has
proved an affaflin, and walled rwÂ®re than ten pesti
lences. ' tri ;
If, in a word, this is liberty, much good may it
do them. But do not let us presume to address t ".
.... r . mi
our prayers to the detty in terms that are repugnant - in ,
to truth, and to PLAIN TRUTH. to
â eil
Much has been fat !by our exclusive patriots against w<
speculation, but no reason has been afiigned why a an
number of gave a violent opposition to an di:
ment offered in the Honfe Reprefentitivcs, to the cu
anfwtr to that part of the address On that tri
fubjedl, the amendment proposed was in the words de
followingâ*viz. " It is sincerely to be lamented that a

A SPECTATOR. g
â e
When good chrillian captains tun-away from 1
Spain and turn Mahomedawsâtrample on the fa-
rred erofs, and become Renajadoes, at Algiers,
they sometimes return to their native country, as o
ter having plundered her fubje&s at Seaâyes, they f
do return sometimes voluntarily after a life of vile
lainyâfo strong are 'he natural affeftio s to one'r, x
native land. But then these gentleme'i lead a life (
of severe penance, discipline and mortification.â (
In Gil Bias is a Â«haraÂ£ter ( Don Raphael) that ,
proves an exception : he returned, became a land- i
robber, and wfed to delight his rogue audience with 1
bravados and the tales of all his plundering. Poeti !
cal jtiliice however is done him at ladâhe filches

> NO subject which has been agitated finee the
r eftablifliment of the National vovernment, has
been of a more delicate nature, than that now
" under difcuilion in the House of Representatives,
1 relative to the payment of the balances due
: from certain of the States to the United Stares.
It has occalioned some warmth, but the refolu
t tlon for calling on the Debtor States for pay
s ment, has passed by a large majority.
The Representatives from the State of New
, York, the largelt Debtor, urge that the mode
and principles of settlement, adopted by the
Commiflioners, v\ ere improper, and that, ifjuf
Â» tice was done, no balance would be found against
d that State. #
r The advocates of the resolution cont-end that
. the accounts have been fairly adjurtedâthat a
' long time and full jhvelligation preclude the
a luppofition of an improper fettietnent âthat no
, objections have been made to the settlementâ
's but that the balances due to ohe creditor States
e have been funded, in pursuance of that adjutl
ment âand that it is unreasonable to call on the
i 8 States for taxes, while the debts of certain
i States remain unpaid
It may be proper to observe, that antifederal
ijrn originated in New-York and Rhode-Island,
ie on the subject of an import of si ve per cent, on
iÂ«" by the old Congress, and ac
id ceded to by all the other States. New-York
e and Rhode-liland, being importing States, were
unwilling to relinquish the advantage of draw
ing a revenue each to the State from imports.
Their opposition came near to involving the
e * country in a civil war. J
c- The fame principle was the main-spring of
rn antifederalifm in New-York, in the year 1788,
b- when the propriety of adopting the present coii
ftitution was under difcuftion. It was made,
l tho' secretly, a main objection to the State's .c
---ceding to that Constitution, That it would be
a relinquifhment of the superior fdvantages of
n " the State, which resulted from her favorable
Â» a poiition for trade " Luring the melancholy in
ia terval between the peace of 1 --M& and the New
Constitution in 1788, that State indeed paid irer
requilitions in specie, which few States did,
1 (and doubtless these are all carried to her
>w but at the fame time, the State laid an import
ed of 5 per cent, on imported goods ; oile halt' or
ive two thirds ofWhich were consumed in other
ro States. She thus drew a large portion of her
\l. revenue from her sister Statesâthe fnrplus of
... which was employed in purchasing up the army
. Certificates at a very low value, and the pro
* seeds of these now constitute the wealth of the
ire " Treasury of the State. The iinW-nfe confifca-
Iful tiwns of laud aided this projefl. What propor
lire tion of the (locks of that State was purchased
nee by the proceeds of confifcations, and what, by
to the proceeds of the Import, is not known. Suf
tice It to fay, that little or no part of it v. ai ac
quired bv the indujlry of the people, as ftuted
jrd by Mr. Williams in Congress. The present
wealth of the Treasury, was delved mostly

that State derived such immmft wealth, from
helr t(ie weakness of the Confederation. i hat admi

ft to manage this qneftion, as not to awaken the wet
smothered fire. Thepropofitions for seizing the Â»

On the other hand, a strong sense of justice in Fn

BASSETERRE, December 2. flit
By a letter from Martinique we learn, that his tho
majesty's fliip Regulus of 44 guns, has arrived at war
Barbadoes ; llie was Cent out with dispatches for Job
the Commander in chief on this and the St. Do- at 6
mingo station : on her paflage out she was fired
into, in the nighttime, by a SpanHh frigate, who TZ
took her to be a transport; the Regulus answer
ed with two broadlides, by Which 14 Spaniards
were killed. The Don then (truck his colours, 1
and confefled that war had been declared at Ca- fix
diz two days before he failed. The Regulus has this
cundijcted her prize fafe into Barbatloes. The or t
truth of the above intelligence may be depen- the
ded on. *
December 6.
On the 33d ultimo, a dlfpatch boat arrived
here from Align ilia, giving an account of an at- S
tack having been'made on that Itland by a French law
frigate and a brig, ori board which were a num
ber of troop;. At the time of the arrival of the Pre
boat, none of*his Majesty's ihips were at the If- Do
land: on the 25th his Majesty's frigate Lapwing En]
captain Barton, arrived and failed the fame e- Sm
veiling for Anguilla, taking on boar J the maftef Do
of the boat as a Pilot ââThe w'.nth being far Tv
to the northward, (he did not reach Angulla 'till A j
late at night on the 26th âSignal having been Ali
i made at St. Martin's of the Lapwings approach. 1
| the troops were all embarked, after having burnt
j the town, murdered numbers of the inhabitants, cal
< and loaded their veifels with the plunder At 1 are
j in the morning of the 'i', th : the Lapwing ran
j within piitol Ihot of the frigate and brig, which 0 f
were endeavouring to make their escape at the
mouth of the harbour, when anaÂ£bion commen
ced which continued one hour and twenty-five
minutes. Favoured bythe darknefsof the night By
the French frigate made her escape through a
narrow channel, between a small I{land and An â¢
guilla;âthe Lapwing having had her pilot kill
ed on the fir ft broadlide would not venture
through. At day break both veflels were seen pai
at anchor near St Martin's âon the Lapwing's th<
approach, the brig attempting to warp to the sri- dr
gate which had her rigging much cutt, was fired thi
on so heavily by the Lapwing that flie was de- nil
ftroyed andmoitjoftfcefailors and folciiers drown- tr
ed : the . rigate, after one broadside from the Lap- lÂ£M
wing Itouck her colons, and proved to be the Deci- in:
ousof 26 guns. The brig mounted three 24 poun- Â« v
ders. There were 128 loldiers killed and woun- ra
ded on board the Decius ; 189 made prisoners. Â»' r
She was so much damaged in the a&ion, having " r
nine fliot holes through the bottom, that after *'
keeping pofleifon of her for two days, captain . 1
Barton finding it impollible to act her into port
. fVom her leaky condition ; and two French fr: "
gates of 44 guns each, being in chafe, of him about
eight miles to leeward, after taking out all the
prisoners, the Decious was blown up, and all the
plunder configilcd ta tjie deep. The Lapwingar- ~
rived 111 this K'oad the night after, having nooth- f
er man killed in t&? ;tclibn but the pilot.
It i.> to be regretted that the Lapwing did not Q
arrive at Anguilla 111 time to fruftrate the deligns tl
of the French, and prevent the depredatsons p
committed ; but we believe there never was a n
cafe where an expedition was so completely de- l
ftroyed. and the hopes of an hoftiie pillager so en- u
tirely blasted, as iu this. The gallantry and good n
conduct of captain Barton, and his brave crew
arc so manifeft, that tire bare narrative of tacls r
do them so much honour as to render unn'ecefla- b
ry any encomiums. x

CAUTION.
WHEREAS very large and heavy debts are j'iftly
due and owing from mefirs. Blair M'Clenacban and
Patrick Meore, of the city of Philadelphia, merchant*,
trading under the firm of Blair M'tiknaclMin and P.
'Moore, and from Blair ia his separate
capacity ; to which, by the laws of the land, all the
joint ai well as separate of the said Gen>le
men, is, and ought to be, liable. Aiid whereas
it is clearly and fatisfa&orily afcertaincd, that mr.
Blair M*Clenachan, of the said firm, has conveyed
away to mr. Jobn 11. iluflan, his fon-in law, to his
daughter, miss M'Chrtaeban, and to his son, George
M'Clrnaeban, several large and valuable real cftates,
well as considerable personal property, in the city
and county of Philadeiphia, in the county of Lancas
ter, in the county of New-Castle on Delaware, and
dfewhere, with a view, as it is apprehended, to de
feat the Creditors in the recovery of their jult debts.â
This is, therefore, to forewarn all persons whgmfu
ever, against the purchase from the said grantees, or
either Â«* thend, of any portion of the ftid real or per
sonal property, as the most vigorous meafurea will
without delay be taken to render the fame liable to
the jo-fc demands of the Creditors.

TQ THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the pubh'c prints,
warning all pcrfonr. agaioft purchasing from the
grantees of Blair M*Clenachan, any portion of the
real and pet fonal estates he conveyed away to
hi# fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upen the fubjeft by a general and
numerous of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Cletiachan aiftl P. Moore as of BljÂ»ir M'Clcna
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confided in the fubferibers by
those creditors : a step which it would have bc< n a
i bieach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
.' The very statement of, the therefore mult dif
: pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
, or It originated in a detire to fccure
( thÂ« property of the debtor as a sand for the pay
. ment of his just debts. It was fan&ioned by the
advice of council as a measure necejary to the fafety
, of the creditors. If the advertisement has been
[ injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owe 9 that injury
to his own unju 11 iliable condu&, not to the fub
feribers who have merely publilhed the truth in
â¢ terms as mild as the fact would admit, and who
, mean to investigate in a high court oCjuftice the
. validity of thole purchases of which Mr. M*Cle
nachan so coelidently speaks.
The fubferibers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
caution against purehafing of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it tÂ© a
t pnrchafe from any other persons (if such there be)
to whom Mr. M'Clenachau may have made similar
conveyances. v
