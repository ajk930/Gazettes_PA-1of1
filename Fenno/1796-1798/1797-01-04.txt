To the Citizens of Philadelphia.
Willing to contribute my mitt to assist the lufferers at
Savannah, I propose to appropriate the products of the
Museum, on Wedflefday, the 4th of January next, for that
express purpose. The constant call for my daily excisi
ons, to prepare. the numerous fubjedta for the mufeurn,
has, and will for along time to come, prevent me from
giving my personal attendance on the vifiters of thi9 rÂ«-
pofitory : But on this particular occasion, it is my inten
tion to be pfefent the whole day ; and it will give me inucb
pleasure to fee the rooms crowded from the early morn
until ten o'clock at night.
N. B. G. W. Peale during the last nine months, haÂ®
made uncommon exertions to enrich and improve the â vfu*
feum, and although it is not yet what it ought,to be with
the aid of the City of Philadelphia, the proprietor asÂ«
fures the public that it is daily progressing in ufefulneft ;
aiid the confU.nt visitor will always find fonte addition*
to elevate his mind, and call forth fentimtnts of love, won

Philadelphia,
WEDNESDAY EVENING, JANUARY 4, 1797.
ExtraA of a letter from,an American gentlemen,
dated Cape-Francais, Nor. 29th, 1796, to his
friend in Philadelphia, received by the Medusa
frigate, Commodore Barney
" I would gfvÂ« you a (ketch of politic*, but as
you will soon fee an nddrefa " to the merchants, k
others, whom it may concern, citizeus of thf Uni
ted States," publiftiedin your papers, fctting forth
the embarrassed (late of our commerceâthe unjust
captures of our veÂ£Telsâthe bad profpefts of be
ing paidâthe conduct of the commiflioners, See.
kc. kc. kc. renders an accountfrem me anneetf
fary. I will, however, observe, that they fcem de
termined to make us take a part with or again ft
them ; they will let us remain neuter no longer.
They are capturing all our vcflVls bound to, and
from Briufh ports, taking all cargoes by force,
where the captain or consignee refufe to fell tu
them.
" They have laid a very heavy duty upon all
goods imported into the island ; the du'y is by
weight, and not on the value, and is curiouHy ar
ranged : all goods are weighed as soon as landed,
oq some articles the duty is equal to firft cost." '
COMMUNICATIONS.
The plundering of Italy has been juftified by those
who, have juftified every thing that the French hive
done from the begintng of the revolution. It is said
that the monuments of thÂ» arts are given by the Ital
ians in lieu of pecuniary contributions, and Yy treaty.
But what kind Â«f reciprocity pofiibly exilt in the
cafe ? âIt is force to weaknessâpower to impotrnc.
Individuals who pra&ice on this principle, .ire loaded
with obloquy & merited contempt ; but Bunibens pof
fcfling power, may extrcUc it to any extent with the
approbation of oor Jacobins, even to plunder, robbe
ry, and the threatening the Independence of their own
country. â
It is in vain the French partizans attempt to (bel
ter themfelvesfrom the defeat the insolence of their
minifler has produced, by pretending that the Bri
ti(h treaty has wrong'd their nation. The fopkifms
and lies dircft on that fuhjeft, already outnumber
the census of the United States ; they have made
more than out damning fib for every foul. Even
Frenchmen possessed of candor and good sense will
feel, though they may not acknowledge this fact
The public faith of America is at this moment the
purelt and most unspotted of any nation on the
globe. Let our patriots who wi(h to fee a French
army marching through our towns, to collect pic
tures, ire. Jtc. kc. Our patriots who already think
of a place of refuge in Louisianaâour patriots who
have agent* in Paris, and who expect to get the
upper hand by French help, and French threats
yes, let our patriots (but the word smells of filth)
this if they dare. Eyes are opened at last.
" The fyltem of terror'' is out of rogue. War
with France it nut even a bug bear. The jacobin*
while they threaten this event, laugh out and be
tray their artifice. To French can, Modena, Par
ma, Tufcary, Rome, Sardinia, Genoa, and Venice,
are mice ; bu\ America hat claws tooâand can
scratch if it cannot flay.
Lately it was argued in company, that Mr.
Bathe served hit employer! very illy. He wins no
body, it wai said. HiÂ» lies are all infolcut and as
frontivc. The answer waiâhe doei cujlom work.
Fer five thousand French erowni a year, a minitier
haa a good right to please hia fancy. 'Tit true the
money it well laid out for America. Every dollar
of the salary buyÂ« an antidote againil our filly at
tachment to guillotine liberty. Every sentence of
Adet's manifefto haj lowered the pulse of credu
lous foily, and raised the Independent spirit of 'â )5.
AÂ» Mr. Bache anticipates the gnat advantage
to the Uuited States to have an afyium lor the de
mocrats from at all, in Louisiana,
in cafe the French (hould get that countrv. A cor
rtfpondent observes, that ft would be prudent for
the party to go fooÃâfor they are down. Aja
cobiu Prefidcnt is ceitaialy not elected. Tfrc peo
ple are nÂ® friends to The Ftench can help
them with nothing but menaces, jargon, and fe
cÂ®H'( hand promtfes 5 and thrfe area worse curren
cy than aftignats. Bt fides, if the party was group
ed together at New Madrid, they would fee the ue
ceflity of some government, and fubrait to it. For
we hear that Barrington, the pick pocket at Bota
ny-Bay, is a great preacher, of morals and good,
order. Why (hould we despair of our democrats !
From the (Bofion) Ckhtinel
A SERIOUS WORD TO SOBER PEOPLE.
Fellow citizens,
More than twenty yeart have elapsed since we
declared ourfclves an independent natien ; furcly it
is not too foot) to a& in a manner correfpondcnt
to that declaration, and to fill (if we are able) the
cbaraAer we have affnmcd .-âBut if we mean to
do this it it high time to pnt an end to the cabals
and intrigue* of foreignert among tie, and'to cxtin
guifh at once the hope they entertain of govern
ing our country. Separated a* we are, by a thou
sand leagues of ocean from the people of Europe,
and distinguished ftillmorc by eharafter and condi
tion, it wovld seem to be no diffisult thing to pre.
serve euifelveafree from theii influence; but, alas,
that influence which we had virtue Enough to refill,
when attempted by the force of one nation, haj
been mere fucccfifulljr a: tempted by the fraudt tf
aiiolber. It Humid be always recolle&ed by the
freemen of America, that an influence over the
people (however acquired) is Co a certain degree,
a'power over the government, and in many cases
they must perceive that an ascendency gained over
a few met), will secure the fuffrages Â»f many.
When I read the Philadelphia Aurora, the New.
York Argus, the Chronicle, and (ome other of
our public newspapers which for a long time'have
been devoted to the service of France, and to the
injury Of the United States mote than the newfp*.
per* of PdHs, i cannot but imagine many of the
writers in luch papers have motives to which the
body of the people are Grangers; yet when 1 fee
that the patronage of such papers is not confined
to foreigners, but ex'ends to many citizens, I con
fefs that I tremble for the fate of my country. For
it is certain, that * people who can habitually cm
brace the follies, and believe the faljhoocis which they
propagate aad approve, tbe crimes and impieties which
they audacioujly jujlify. mujl be so deficient both in
isiifdom end virtue, that they CANNOT long be
fret: âFor without knowledge, without morals, -
and without rjligion among the people, I a(k whire
will freedom find a fuppoiC? The fatal experiment
of maintaining liberty in contempt of religion and
morality, has too oaen been tried ; it has always
ilTued as it mud forever iflue in the establishment of
mjtiltice, and tyranny of the wotjl kindâfor it
mult always Transfer the powers of society to the
mofl profligate of its members, men who will flat
ter the vices of people to obtain 'heir fuffragei,
and at the fame time unite with foreign enemies
fur the falce of their support. How such men ac>
quire power, and hoiv they makeufe of it, the hi
ftoryof France, from the rife of Marat, to thÂ«
fall of Robespierre, too plairHy {hewsâindeed
the spirit of injuliice, intolerance and batbaious
tyranny which they exhibited, drew from Condor*
Cet, at a very early period, the reluctant cuntef.
lion, " that the republic mujl fallwe all fee or
may fee how fully Condorc*t's apprchcnfions are
realized} for, though the fo>ms of a republic; are
preserved, yet of liberty which conftuwes all its en.
cellence, the very embryos f.em to have been dejlroyed.
Many well meaning men until lately,|have doubted
whether France was capable of the Machiavelian
policy with which she has been charged oward
the United States ; but no impartial man, I think,
cSn any longer deny that she intend/to eltablifh a
complete dominion over our country; prefumi>Â£
on her military fucceff.s in Europe, and encouraged
by her numerous partisans here, she has now pan
ly disclosed herdelign toward us, and if we haveiAwt
penetration enough to fee it, and virtue fufficicnt
lo refilt it, whatever may be the refuit ot the
piefent effort, oÂ«r futuie tr i quillity is hopeless.

as is in his power to the amusement of the generous citi

An Engagemsnt between two Frigates,
Or, A SEA FIGHT.
This exhibition, in fliades, will undoubtedly be very
interesting to the fpc&ators. They will be able to dif
tinguilh the manoeuvring of the two (hips, of the guns as
they are firing, with the concomitant noise ; the rigging
and fails made ragged hy the (hot; the continuation of
the battle, with the one lofingher ntain-topm&ft, the roar

the boats, andwonnded men on the furfaceof the watei,

BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS.
FRIDAY, 'OCTOBE*. 21
ARMY ESTIMATES,
Mr. Windham, stated, the whole force, f or
which piovifmns was to be made, was 196,674
men : in this were reckoned not only the home ar
my, known under the heads of guards and garri
sons, in which were included the troops in Guern
sey jnd Jersey, but also the trwops serving abroad,
under the name of Plantation army, including all
those in the Well-Indies, Nova Scotie, Gibraltar;
in short, in all our colonies, excepting tbofr inthe
East-Indies, which were on a different eftablilhment.
T he expence of the whole of those, and all theap
pendages, he dated to amjunt to the I'um of
5,190,7211. This the committee would fee was
somewhat, though very little, fliort of the last years
estimate. The commir.ee, hewever; were not to
look upon this as a saving, because the other esti
mates not prefentcd, would contain fame addition
al expences : but the whole, he was furc, taken to
gether, would not exceed those of the last year.
1 he Home army, or guards and garrisons, he da
ted to amount to 60.75$ men.
The remainder, or Plantation troops, 1064,277
âon the former of these there was an exceft over
that of last year of 11,546 âand on the other
there was a diminution of 11,641. DÂ«dudting that
exccfs from the diminution, there wat some small
rediiftior. on the whole.
Having thus Itatcd the various (ftimatcs under
their refpeftive heads, he moved a refutation, that
a number of men, not less than 60,765, be'em
pliiyed for the turreiit year.
Gen. Tarleton, said there was one branch of ex
pence, which he th tight ought to be saved, re
cruiting itwnejr. If we abandoned our old mode
of railing men by heat of drum, fair the new French
mode of requisition, there could be no occasion for
lavilhing money on the recruiting service.
The cxpence of the last year for the army alone,
amounted he said, to the .whole revenues of the
country, ar it flood on the year prior to the com
mencement of the war How then, he wished to
kndw, were the other expenses to be defrayed par
ticularly as we were going to raise an additional
force of no Hfs than one hundred and three thou
sand men ? This was a furious conlideratien for the
feoufe of commons, particulatly for a new parlia
rucnt. Theie wete many other things upon which
he might enter, but he owed it to the (ituation of
the country not to do so. AÂ» to the refourcei for
these cxp ences,,he could not fee where they were
âourconquefts were rather bofiowed from pur al
lies than taken from our enemies. Hehopedthey
would not be an obilrudlion to Lalt
year there was a kind of i;oyal piomife, that there
thould be gieat operations in the Weil Indies : but,
it we looked to the Well-Indies, either in a gene
ral view of the whole, or particular islands, there
was no cause to triumph* and it would remain foi
till that go. tleman, Vitlor Hughes, was dislodged ;
The chancellor of the exchequer brought in th.'
hill for enabling his m-ijelly to require the provifi
onal aflillance of certain pcifons, in order to form
a body of cavalry ; which was read a.firll time, and
oideicd 10 be reid a second time to morrow.
Exporhitian of Cam.
Mr. Ryder prefaced hii mo'ion with observing,
that t,laugh si me reduction had taken place in the
pi iceÂ« of corn, the com nittee would doubtlefi fee
the propriety of continuing the regulations whici
were already in exillefice, with refpeft to that ar
ticle, and of (till holding ou' inducement! to its
impoitation, and re{lriftiiÂ»ns on in exportation
The aft which wis at prrfent in foree on the fnb
jed, went to three points : to the prevention of
the exportation of corn, to the importation of other
provisions. The price of coin, i' was true, was
still such as to warrant a fuppoliiion that exporta
tion #ould be prevented by it j but at in a,parti
cuhr dirt' ift the fluctuation of the maiket might
cnnfiderably reducc that price, he thought it for
the general interest of the country that ths laws now
in force concerning corn fhotild be continued, left
this local reduction of its value should be the occa
sion of its exportation. All other provifioni were
at a price which would render the other part of the
aft still of use. He should therefore move a refo
lutian for continuing the aft of last frffion, with
the amendment of two claufcs, which, when the
farmer had been able moie juttly to estimate the
nett produce of the year after feed lime, might be
found necessary. The fiift was, that a permission
should be inferred in the bill, for repealing it du
ring this feflion, if it should be found inconvenient ;
the ether a limilar permission to his majesty in coun
cil, to suspend or repeal any part of it during the
vacation of Parliament.
The committee.agreed to this refutation, which
was reported to the houfr, and leave obtained to
briug in a bill conformable to it.
Mr. Ryder moved to consider the bill for permit
ting the importation of unmanufactured silk in
neutral bottom*, which wai agieed to, and a com
mittee of the whole houfc ordered for the purpose
tomorrow.

following mffage from the memoirs of general D â¢-
nican, entitled, " The Banditti UnmaskedÂ«
tranflatiun of which we are happy to And is now in
the press.
" This expedition (a descent upon England)
which is not so chimerical Â«9 some prions afLÂ£\ t<i
believe, has two principal objrfts :ârirft, to Ly
wa!le a rich and flovirifhinp country, Wy the intio
du&ion of Robcfpierrean liberty {âand fecondl*,
in the event of a fypurate peacf with the emperor
to get rid of that mafj of Belgians, and
other tronps, for which the Dtreftory will have r.o
further occasion, and which they mull Tend to pt
rifli in foffie country or other.
" For a long time, the irrtmenfe riches of Eng.
land h*Te been holden out as a lure to ifcc repub'.i-,
cans ; thepcrfons to command this famous
drfcent, rely on meeting jarith -v-w(Â«l fiicnda, par
ticularly in Ireland. They publicly boast that they
(hall be received with open arms, and seconded t-y
a numerous party. I*he plans for carrying thijdr
fign into execution are all fettled ; and the moment
is probably not far distant, when ambition will curne
to expire with rage on the coasts Â»f an ifte, whose
inhabitants are real patriots, and in which the ge
neral fafety prescribes the necessity of retraining
with vigoyr the partizansof anarchical libsrty, op
pit-flive equality, and wretched fraterniiy."
STOPPAGE or INTERCOURSE asms*
FRAN CE and ENGLAND.
The ftnpage of all communication with France,
for the la It fortnight, or m-ire, hai created no small
decree Â»f speculation, and varioui are the conjec
ture! to which this circumstance hat giveu life.â
We have heard it attributed to internal infurreAion,
but wc do not think that any immediate pieviou*
appearance! in Paris, or the department!, warrant
thiÂ» conclusion. It hai been attributed, and we
think with greater jutticc, to the dtfaftcTi cf the
French armiri, a knowledge ot which, thro' rfie
channel of the French journal!, the diredtory are
probably unwilling ftyuld, at the prefeui ciifil,
reach this country.
We can, however, aflign a flill deeper and more
important cause for thÂ« fioppage of communication*
from France. It is well known, for we stated it to the
public at the time ofitÂ» arrival, that the paiTport for
an agent to be sent from this country to treat foi*"peaee,
was cloggtil.with the new and ui.reafonÂ«ble stipulation,
that such agent or envoy should be in efled with full
powers to treat definitively. This condition inftitut*
ed, thatno intercourse should be allowed with thiÂ»
country during the progress of such negotiation. Thlt
our Ministers ftuuld have availed themselves of the
paiTport, clogged with such conditions prove! mor<
strongly than any word can do, their earnest desire to
procure tranquility to Europe. It never could bel'up.
posed, however that the French could mean that no
communication was to be made by ourenvoy of his re
ception, and his idea, from appearances at Parii, of the
probible result of his mission. V'dfind, however,
frona the fvent that the French construe their condi
tion ia its molt rigid and literal sense, and will not
permit of the smallest commnnica'ion, till prÂ«bal)ly
the return of our Ambassador re infeftai or till the cb
jcdl of his embaiTy (hall have been completed. Such a
proceeding, however, iÂ« equally new and
jnd .â Â« we conceive that no proportion for peacr will bÂ«
liflcned to, that does not include all our allies, Ivho
have l'o nobly persevered in the prosecution of tlje con
test : and as many pontsof difcufiton rnuft neceflai ily
arifc in the arrangements ti at are to lead to peace, wÂ«
conceive that no negeciation whatever can be carried
en under such reflr (ftiops, if in such unfair and illibc
rar-reitridlions the Executive Directory mean to perfc
vere j we ihall not be furpril'ed therefore, to fee
Malmeibury return without having been able to acort!-
pliih the grand objeA for which he was sent.
Notwithilanding the many paragraphs and reports
to the contrary that have been circulated, we can aiÂ»
sure the publtc, that to a lite hour last night, no met
sage from nor anyjaccount of Lord Malmefcury hid
reached town lincehis embarkation in the flag or truÂ«

NEW MILITIA LAW.
In co/ifequmee of the dread of an invasion, Par

be drafted, organised, difciplioed, and to take the
field for a certain 'number of day* ; when new
drafta are to be made, and take the place of the
firo, who return to their homes; and f* on in suc
cession. Thit feleft militia, which thus prepared
for a&ual ferrice, ana will be kept ready to miif
ter at a moment's warning, is to consist of 63,681
men. An oath is to be idminiKered to each man
when drafted, purpotting, that he ii a Proteiant,
that he acknowledges allegiance to his majesty, and
that h# will fevve for the defence of she realm dur
iag the exigence of this ad. Fifteen pounds is
the penalty for a nÂ«gle& or refufal of service, when
drafted, or to take the oath.

THE caution.introduced into the public prints,
warning all pcrfons agaiwft purchasing from the'
granteeÂ«of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and personal eftatcs he conveyed away to
his fofi-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upon the fubjeft by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P, Moore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confided in the subscribers by
those creditors : a step which it would have been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very statement of the fact therefore must dif
pcl the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindi&ive." It originated in a defile to secure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fantfioned by the
advice itt council as a measure ncctJJarj to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advettifement has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owet that injury
to his own unjuftiliable conduct, not to the iub
fcribÂ«rÂ» who have merely pubHfhed the truth itr
terms as mild as .(lie fatt would admit, and who
mean to invelligite in a high court eif justice the
validity of thole purchases of which Mr. M'Cle
nachan so confidently speaks.
The subscribers therefore are bound by a feiife
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
caution against ptirchafing of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
purchase from any other persons (if such there be)
to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
conveyances.
