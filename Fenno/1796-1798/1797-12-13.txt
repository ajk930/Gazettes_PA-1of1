To the Stockholders of the Bank of the
Uniteb States.
Gentlemen,
IF the spirit with which you engaged in I
J the original plan of the Bank of the United
I States, and-the vast aid which you have af
| forded to the government and to ycÂ»ur fellow
citizens by this laudable enterprixe, : be
justly confideredas a pledge of your fidelity'
to your intereft3 as they are iiifcparably con
nefted with the general weal, we are natu
rally led tor ask if you will now consent to
an addition to your capital (lock that it tWay
; keep pace with the increased and increafijig
demand* consequent to the growiug popu
lation and general bufihf fs of your country ?
If you can coijfiently with your rights and
to do this, you will confer
new obTigatians on your country, if you will
also ask for an extension of your charter, in
return for a permiflion in favour of govern
ment to create a limited number of addition
al (hares to be fold at not less than 25 per
cent, advance, forWje sole benefit of the Uni
ted States.
Thus whenever one million of new stocks
may be created, 250,000 dollars will be gain
ed to the Treasury of the Union, and in due
time, wkich in the nature of things cannot be
far dijlant, four millions of stock might be
beneficially fold, by which the United States
may gaia one million, and for which permif
flon on your part, they will not, they can
not, reasonably refufe to double the term of
your charter. In a future essay, I will en
deavour to /hew in part the incontrovertible
benefits that will result from this plan which
sooner or later mull be adopted.
You are therefore only reqyefted to con
fider whether this is, or is not, the accepted
time and of course a day of falvatton to many
important concerns of your country. W
we agree, you will consider the propriety of
preparing a petition to Congress for these
pufpofes at your next general meeting, if
not, it will only be deferred for futiire con
fideratiori.
PUBLICOLA.
WASHINGTON, (PotÂ»<wmac) Dec. 2.
Mr. More,
I fer.d you extra&s from original letters
written by a real American in Europe,
who fees and judges of the palling events
with impartiality. They tend to shew
that the recent violeneet in France are
not the consequence of any real plot or
conspiracy (at least not on the paÂ»t of
the perfoiis accUsed) in favor of royalty,
but are the effe&s of a dfep and long me
ditated plan of the old Jacobin party to
continue their power and tyranny over
the people, by a most atrocious and arbi
trary violation ; not only of the consti
tution but of every moral and political
right, which a nation can hold sacred.
D.
June,.z6, 1797. âThe negocjations for
peace between France and Great-Britain are
resumingâThey are to be conduced it -is
said at LifTe in Flanders ; I still doubt ve
ry much whetherthey will terminate fuccefs
fully ; there is yet too much ambition and
too much of the disorganizing spirit in the
French government to allow them a disposi
tion sincerely pacific Thei* treatment of
Venice and Genoa,both neutral Hates, which
hare nerer been engaged in the coalition has
been in open defiance, not only of all juflice
and honor, but of all shame ; they have not
been fatisfied withdifTolving thegovernments
of those republics, but are dismembering
them, and taking part of their territories to
give them for indemnity to the Emperor,
and the king of Sardinia, instead of the do
minions they have facrificed to the conquer
ing genius of France. Buonaparte, not on
ly wages, but formally declares warâmakes
peaceâdiltolves governmentsâorders the
adoption of othersâsets up or pulls down
the fovereigrvpeople, just as suits his own
caprice, or that of hii employersâAnd ie
the midst of the deep tragedy of massacre,
pillage, aflaflination, and crimes of every
dye, that attends these revolutions, the farce
of liberty, of equality of fraternity, of the
rights of man, with its whole babyloniflidia
left of imposture and hypocrisy is afliduoufly
kept up, and I verily "believe still finds its
dupes.
July, 2 1797.â I wrote you three or
four days ago from , which I left the
next day. I then mentioned that Paftoret
had made a motion in the couucil of five
hundred, tending to annul the arrete's of
the directory relative to Ameriea ; particu
larly that of 12 Ventofe, which he truly re
presented ascontrary to the constitution. It
was referred to a committee offive, to report
upon itâYou will have a more circumstan
tial account of the whole matter frum ano
ther quarter, but there are feme observa
tions which will not occur elsewhere, and
which may perhaps in some degree contri
bute to give you a just idea of our affairs in
France.
Infinite pains have been taken there to
spread universally the idea that there are in
America only two parties, the one entirely
devoted to f ranee and the other to Eng;
land. Mr. Adams has been, in the Paris
news-papers expressly represented as at the
head of the latter, and Mr. JefFcrfon of the
former.âThe English too have been much
disposed to countenance the fame idea. The â 
artifice of the French party America, to
throw the odium of partiality to the Eng
lish, upon every man who would not facri
fice his country to France, has heen very
induflriaufly pursued, and in a very consid
erable degree fuccefsful. It is one inftanee
cftheirdenominaticn-giving fyflem, which 1
Fauchet so much extolsâln France, every i
thing has contributed to give prevalence to
this falftbood. Paftoret therefore, iB mak- .
ing his motion said that the Arherican gov
ernment had indeed given some reason to
doubt of the loyalty of its intentions, by
their treaty with Great-Britain, but that
this was not fufficient for a rupture, &c.
The universal dislike of that treaty, by all
the parties in France, while none of them
can give one substantial reason for their dif
like,is forus its brightest panegyric. Itfhows
that it interferes with vitws which they dare
not avow. The objeftions that they have
ever made against it are perfectly futile.â
The arrete of 12 Ventofe bears internal evi
dence, that tie reafoni assigned are not the
teal ones. Some observations were drawn
up, about 2 mouths ago, concerning*the ar
rete, They dWelt particularly. upbn the
poit)t of the Brififh treaty, and fliewtd that
the jdireSory, try rafting Ae rules of their
upon certain articles of the treaty,
merely fought a pretext : that it was totally
destitute of foundation,fince every one of the
rules, was not only variant from, but in di
rect violation of the article cited sot itsjuf
tificatiou. In order to {hew this jn it* clear
est and mod; linking light, the several rules,
and articles were placed in opposite tolumns,
so that their incompatibility might appear
at a Cngle glance, and some observations
were added at the cjofe of each. This pa
per was fecn by Paftoret before he made his
motion, and he concurred in the opinion
that the arrete was Uiconftitutional. But
as to the opposite columns, it was said, that
in these difcuflions all long quotations (hould
be avoided ; because they would not read them.
Whether Paftoret read them or not, I (hall
not fay ; but what fort of difcuflion can be
carried on with perfbns who will not read
the very state of the- queflion in debate ?
Whether that part of the paper was read,
or was offered for reading or not, Paftoret
did not thekfs complain of the British trea
ty, and complain of it as an aft of the A
niericin government, unfriendly to France.
v Paftoret is ope'of the noil distinguished
memberj of theVouncil of five hii/idred.â,
He ctnf in at the firfl constitutional elec
tioarih Ofteber 1795, an< * was not a mem
hef of the convention. He has all along
fnpported, with eloquence and firmnefs, the
cause of moderation and jufticfc, against t(ie
revolutionary violence and wickedness which
' has so often prevailed, even since the estab
lishment of the constitution. Dumolard is
anothej- member of the fame description,
and these two are certainly the most con
spicuous charafters that have arisen in that
third part of the legiflatura.
Barbe Marbois, our old acquaintance,
came in at the fame time,>and appears to
have the fame system in the couficil of el
ders. This party, since the introduftion of
the new third part, have an unquestionable
and firong majority in both councils ; but
the old remaining third of the convention, with
their fourfifths of the directory are reviving the
jacobin clubs, preparing for infurreÃions and
endeavouring to secure the armies on their fide.
Since the motion of Paftoret, Dumolard
hat brought forward one of the like nature
against the measures condufted or permitted
by the direftory in Italy'. It occasioned
forae debate and finally was adjourned, until
the report of the committee upon the motion of
Pajloret Ojould be made.
This circumstance deserves notice, for the
adjournment was upon an observation of
Thibaudeau " that it was improper and
might be dangerous to investigate these
tranfaftions in Italy,fince they might be deep
ly conneded with the negociation for a general
peace." So you fee Genoa, Venice, and
perhaps Switzerland are to be not only re
volutionized but plundered, ifflmembered,
divided, tern in pieces in every way, to
make au arrangement for a general peace.
And as the fubjeft is adjourned until the re
port upon the differences with America shall
be made, ft looks very much as if some ar
rangement relative us too, was in con
templation as connefted with the negocia
tious for a general peace. There is an ob
servation of Montesquieu, that it is some
times bad policy, in a small state to re
main neutral in the wars between two great
powers its neighbours, because neither of
them being bound to it by the force of ob
ligation or intertft, they may finally fettle
the difference by Sacrificing the small power
between The truth of this remark
fs ftrtttigly exemplified by the pTcfent state
of the Italian republics though it is far
from beiug clear that they could have escap
ed it by taking part in the war. However
that may he, it is important for us to take
care not to be made ourselves the viftims of
any such agreement. If France had any
such designs, it mii/l be in the plan of fevering
the United States into two republics, onÂ« of
which (he would take under her proteftioti,
and mould to her will, leaving the other to
the influence and management of Britain.
lam far from being certain that the British
government -would be averse to such a division.
I hope they will both be narrowly watched.
July 6, 1797. âOur Situation with
France is ft ill equivocal, and dangerous,
Gen. P. afts with gre-t pruder.ee and wis
dom, and I ana persuaded will do every
thing poflible in the disadvantageous Situati
on in which he still remains. But there are
! many wicked Agents, and many {very bad
pafiions at work against the interest and the
friendfhip ofithe two nations.âWith regard
to the Weft-India depredations, the Direc
tory h? Ve published a letter from Santhonax
and hii brother Robbers their Agents, in
which they freely declare that they had em
ployed Cruizers against American vessels
without authorityâbut because they want
ed provisionsâbecause the Americans were
ill disposed and because after the eleftion of j
John Adams as President of the United!
States, they concluded there would be a war j
between the two Countries. The Direfto- â¢
ry haverecall'd those Commiflioners and their
infamous piracies have not been unnoticed
even in Paris. An investigation and fcruti- j
ny has been called for into the hostile mea- :
fCires of the Direftory ; there is, no doubt, '
a strong party in France who disapprove of,
themj but they are afraiddf nothing so much
as being too much in the right.
Among those who call and think thera
felves our friends, and who are indeed sensi
ble how unjustly the Djreftery has treated
us, is Barbe Marbois, a man well known
in America, and now a very diltinguifhed
member of the Council of Anticnts.âHe
has. lately made a report relative to the ex
pences in the department of foreign Affairs.
It appears they .are four or five times as great
a3 thty were in the mod extravagant periods
of the did government. And for all
this augmentation of charges, they "have
according te Marbois got but a very con
temptible set-Â«Â£ negotiators abroad ; among
whom he has with equal joltice included
their late MinilWr to the. United States
" One of them, (fays Marbois) Sent to a
friendly nation,, will imagine he feryes his
Country by sowing -diitruit and suspicion
between the Government and the people.â'
In order to acqqire the Reputation ofbeing
aftivc and influential, he will expose twona
tious united by their reciprocal lnterefls, by
benefits and Gratitude, to a fatal rupture ;
he will exert himfelf to fully the splendor of
the faireft'life, the eminent qualities ps the
greatest man, that our Century .can offer, to
history, aud present to posterity ; And e
ven though he should not attain the End
proposed, the minds of men will neverthe
less be alienated, and a double portion of
Wisdom will be necessary to bring them a
gain together." So you fee that even in the
Capital of France, even in the fanftuary of
their Legislature, a public, and an eloquent
voice is yet found ready to pay the tribute
of Justice to the Character of Washington,
and to reward with richly deserved Contempt
the reptile that would flied its filth and ven
om upon such brightnrfs.
July 29, 1797- âMy means of commu
nication from France are very much abridg
ed since I left , and I do not well uri
derftand what the Confluences to be
expefted from, the late phange of Miniflers
there, yau wijl find that strong diffentioiis'
have broken out between the legiflatita artd
executive bodies, and between the Members
of the Direftory. They will perhaps bring
on an accomodation, that will reftfire a fort
of Peace, but the remnants of the old Con
vention have entailed upon themselves fore
ver, the curse which Tyrants never escape ;
the undying worm of a guilty conscience,
and the terrors of approaching punifliment.
They never can be recoaciled to the Nation
which they have ruin'd and difgrae'd, nor
the Nation tÂ® them. War, open or Undcr
ftood, /s their irrevocable destinyâthey can
never support themselves but by force, and evem
appearance inditates that their only reliance ts
upon the military.
August 17, 1797.âThe debates m
Congress upon the importanrfubjefts which
were brought before them in their extraor
dinary session, fall far short of the manly
and vigorous spirit, which discovered itfelf
in the answer of the house to the President's j
Speech- If their deeds had corresponded
with the language of that Answer our Ne
gociatorj would have come out with a favo
rable profpeft of Succeeding in their million.
They will arrive at a time when negociation
is going forward in all quarters, and attempts
will doubtless be made to confound and in
fluence one with the other, though our pre
tensions have nothing in Common with any
other nation! Portugal hasjuft made a
Sepatate peace, by which another ally of
Great Britain is taken off without its Con
sent. The terms are yet unknown, but the
" Times" Says " that the Conclusion of this
treaty was one of the last events that our
Court could haveexpefted." Of the famous
Coalition it i*ay be said, that it was Joint
and Several; they began all together, and
concluded all alone.
August 31, 1797 âIt is painful to e
very true American to fee ene foreign Mi
nister using such language, as has been em
ployed by Miniflers of powers profeffing
friendfhip towards us, ever since the time of
Genet. To degrade our Government in
the Eyes of the world by (hewing that it
may be insulted and reviled with impunity,
is a part of that system which our foreign
and domeilic Jacobins pursue with concert
ed exertions for the difTolution of our union
and the overthrow of our Conilitution. The
figure of a Spanish Minister, afting as an
instrument to promote such views, however
incongrnnns, cannot be furprizisg. It does
113 no honour in the eyes of the world,when
they fee Such Conduft paSs without marks
of resentment : but the national charafter
fuffers still more, from instances Â»f such tran
faftions as are unfolded in Blount's letter.
A Senator of the United States !âand
write such a paper !âand aft such a part !
We have Enemies and Enviers enough in c
very part of Europe to feixe hold of such
Circiimftances, and blazon them forth as
proofs of our depravity and Corruption. â 
In this country (England) a profound
tranquility generally pAvails: in Scotland
the papers of the day mention some Riot
which has been excited by anew Militia
law, but the Affair wilLprobably not be ve
ry important. Inland is quiet Miile the
sword waves over her head. I perceive by
the public accounts from Holland, that 'he
Constitution which had been so long foi miiig,
and with so much pains made conformable
to the Will of the French Directory, has
been rejefted by the people .in the primary
Affcmblies. Vet the French Minister had
formally declared it was approved by his
Government, and formally intimated their
Expectation and wish that the People might
adopt it. It appears that a very small por
tion of the People took any part in the de
liberations upon it; or attended the prima
ry AiTemhlies : a declaration of political
faith was preftribed, as a tell which inevi
tably operated an exclusion to one halfof the
People, Of the reft, fhat is the moderate'
patriots,who have hitherto held the reigns
of the Government under French 'protecti
on, the numbers among the People are so
small, tliat the Jacobinical Patriots out-vot
es! them by a large majsrity, and threw out;
the plan as not fufficiently democratic, and
as bearing unequivocal marks of federalifm.
The negociat ions for peace both at Udi
na and at Lisle, advance but slowly,. It jg,
probable that the conclusion of the former
is retarded by two points upon which the;
parties cannot agree. The ceflioa. or redo
ration of Mantua, and the appointment of a.
congrtfs for a general peace. Upon the is
sue oflhefe quedions, probably depends all
so the profpecl of peace, or of a continuance
to the war between France and Britain.
The ftatc of internal affairs in France, af
fords the fame profped of disunion between
.the legislative and executive powers, tW
fame symptoms of approaches towards a mi
litary government as wiien I, wrote you hi ft;
the parties are becoming.more ar.d more bit
ter and rancourous against each other from
dw to day. Tie peopit very evidently fa
vor the fide of the legiflijture but the armies
have very apparently been conciliated by
the directory. \
London, Sept. ii, 1797. You Will
have seen hv the publie.prints that Edmund
Burke died in the course of the month of
July. His executors have within these few
days published,three memorials upon French
affairs, written by hitn in the years 1791,'
1792 and 1793. I have sent you a copy of
one of them.
If the several states and governments
which are spread over the face of Europe
are considered as composing a fort of con
federated whole, thei.- fituatioij aod circum
ilances appear to resemble in an extraordina
ry degree, thofc in which the fame portion
of the earth was placed at the period when
the Roman republic fell under the ambition
and talents of Csefar. There is.atthis time,
as there was then, one single fundamental
principle upon which the' whole fabric of 1
European policy ftafids.âA revolution is
taking place which mull entirely overthrow
that principle. Such was the cafe then.
The ultimate,cosfequence, in that indanee,
was the total dissolution of the system by
which Europe was governed, and centuries
of barbarism ; the novelties of the present
day are calculated to produce, with much
greater rapidity, the fame effed. If there
be any accuracy in this view of things, the
similarity between the charader and genius
of Burke and that of Cicero will appear
wonderfully ftrikingâlt is one of the :50ft.
retnarkable circumlt.inces common to both
that riling from an obfure origin, or as Paine
expresses it, upon the democratic floor, they
were the mod ftrennous and energetic defetv
ders of the aristocrats ; that is, of the inftfr
tutions upon which alone the protedion of
property subsided. In one refped the mo
dern philosopher, orator and statesman, was
mate, fortunate than the'antient ; he did not
live to fee the EnaTTff3"fPfsmevable ruin of
his cause, nor did he the martyr of iu

College, with a report of the Secretary of
the Treasury thereon J be referred to a com

Mr. Shepard presented the petition of
Giles Wolcott, late a captain in the army,
praying for recompence for lodes sustained

Mr. Lyon moved to have this petition re

the committee of claims were determined to

though this claim was harred, that the peti

This motion not being seconded, Mr.
Shepard moved to have the petition referred
to the committee of claims Agreed.
Mr. Harper called for the order of the day
on the bilLfor podponing commence

which being agreed to, the House resolved
itfelf into a committee of the whole on this

Mr. Lyon moved to'expunge the word
June and insert January ; but on the chair
man informing him that would not be in or
der, he changed his motion to the inserting
of the 3id 'of December, 1798; instead of
the 30th June,
Mr. Williams believed- the necessity of a
postponement of the commencement of this
aft, was oecafioner} by the ftcknefs which
had lately afflided thfs city, as that render
ed it impossible to get the prepara
tions for carrying it into effect executed.
'The Objed which lie fctppofed the gentle
man had in view, would be better attained,
if he Ueferred it until the bill was introduced
for making the alterations Which had been
' u ggcfted as tieceffary. A resolution had
tbeen feut to the committee of ways and
I means, directing- them to report a plan for
railing a iutiicient revenua to meet the de
mands which would be made upon govern
ment in the year fSoi. If this plan (hould
include u land tax, he {hould wiih that the
damp duty might not take place, as he vo
ted for it only on the ground of its prevent
ing the neccffity of a land-tax; but until
;his were ascertained, he (hould be in fa
vour of the â  damp-tax. [The Chairman
reminded Mr. W. that the quedionwas not
whether the Stanjp-Ad fnould be repealed,
but whether its operation should be fufpeud
ed for a limited time.] Mr. W. (aid, if the
amendment proposed were agreed to, heihould Mtifider it in the Unle light as a
peal of the law.
Mr. Brookes fa id, the sole nbjeft of the
bill before them was, to give time to the Se
cretary of the Ti edfury to prepare the ne
cessary damped pipes before the aft took cf
feft. IVhat were the vie ws of the gentle- -A
man who proposed the amendment, he fam<
could not fay. Perhaps he would himfelf '""Li
explain why he wilhed the aft to befufpen- pose
ded for a year, which was nearly one fourth dant
of the whole duration, and would, of course, the -
facrifice nearly that proportion of the reven- His
ue expefted from it. h' s i
Mr. Lyon said, one reason with him was Few
he had his doubts whether the time propo- enÂ®
fed for the suspension, would be.fufficient dev<
for government to make the necessary pre-
parations. The time which had been given don
was fafd to be too (Sort, fee wilhed now to fin
give time enough. The late ucknefiyn this mig
city wjis alledged as an apology for not ha- mill
ving the necessary preparations in re-.dinefs. con
He thought this a j>oor excuse; because, mo<
if the people of this city were sick, the j cou
whole country was not so. He had another j Â°PP
reason for his motion. He wilhed the peo- to 1:
pie to have time to get ready to receive a all
(tafnp-tax. It was a tas every where odi- Â° WI
pns to the people of the United States, and c
abTolutely necessity could only reconcile it g O%
to them. t â¢ 01 '
The question upon agreeing to the amend- ted
ment'was put and negatived, Mr. Lyon on
ly rising.in favour of it. ' t . at
Mr. Coit then moved to {lrike out, as tivc
xinaeceffary,'the second feftion of the bill, nlt '
which, had a reference to the time for which the
the law Ihould have existence. '9B
Mr. Harper wifhedthe feftion not to be ris
struck out, but amended. The objeft was (Â«!
to prevent the fix months'which would be coi

carried ; the committee rose, the house took P ai
up and agreed to the amendment, and the
bill wss ordered to be ertgroffed for a third ' a :
reading to-morrow. !t
Mr. Macon moved that the committee of th(
the whole be djfciiarged from the farther I cu
coniideration cf the report of the commit- j P '
tee of cla'ms on the petitions of Samuel Ab- [" e
bot, and others. The committee of claims in J
had recommended that provision by law Â« !(
fbould be made for the relief of these peti
tioners, whose claims are for arrears of pay, I th
&C. due fqr services during the war, whose j in
accounts were liquidated, and certificates j
granted ; but they alledge that they never j
riteived them by reason ofthe default ofthe I
agents ofthe regiments to which they be-1
longed. The committee adds, that great lan
caution, on the part of the officers of the 1 all
treasury will be tb prevent abuses. j R
Mr, M. wi(hed, therefore, that this report ve
might be again re-committed, in order that I ec
the cbmmittee of claims might fay what the ej
checks were which would prevent impofi- I di

effeftual. I e:
Messrs. D. Foster and Shepard were op- ai
posed to" the motten, and thought the house w
ought to interfere in behalf of tbre petion- d
ers to do them justice, and that it wouldi>e d
ijloing nothing to re-Commit the' report, un- I
til the house had decided whether they I si
â would, or would not agree to this princi- I a

Mr. Gall 3 * l ' ll moved'for the order of the I

to whom was referred to enquire into and re- j c
port on the expediency or inexpediency of I
designating certain claims against the Unit- I 1

of the ass of limitation ; which being a-1 1
greed to, the house accordingly resolved it- I f
felfinto a committee of the whole on the 1 1
fubjeft, Mr. Dent in the chair. The re I
port having been read, which ftatcd the in- I 1
expediency of suspending their operation, j 1
and Mr. D. Foster having moved a concur-1 1
rence, Mr. Gallatin vvidied to amend the re- j 1
port, by adding a resolution to the following 1 :
effeft : I
" Resolved, That so much of an aft, en- I
titled an aft making further provision for I
lupporting public credit, and for reducing I
the public debt, passed March 3, 1795Â» as j
bars from settlement, after a limited time, J
land office tickets, final settlements, and in- I
dents of interest, be suspended for a certain I
time."
The motion produced a very lengthy de- j
bate,.which, as it is conceived to be pretty
{ generally intcrefting, will be given to-mor
row, with the report of the committee of
claims upon the fubjeft. It was fuppoited
\ bv Messrs. Gallatin, Broikes, Dayton, Da
na, Read, Coit, Elmendorph, Isaac Parker,
S. Smith, Thatcher, J. Williams, and Bald
win. It was opposed by Messrs. N. Smith,
Allen, Edmond, and Macon. Noqueftion
was taken. The committee reported pro
gress, and had leave to fit again.
Mr. Harper, from the committee to whom
was re-committed the bill for the relief of
the representatives of William Carmichaej,
deccafed, reported a new bill, which was
twice read, and committed for 10-morrow.

Coss/w & Co. It
All our readers muil liave heard of the dinai
famous Felix Coffin, of Nantz, the memo- pose
rfalift agaiuft the United States. We sup- fatisi
posed he was a villain, and we have Co.
dant evidence to confirm the supposition, in
the deposition of a capt. Glad of New-York.
His conduit to that captain 3nd relative to
his (hip and cargo, was knavilh and savage.
Few are the bone/! men whooppofe the gov
ernment of the United Statesâevery day Wf , Â£
developes some scandalous trait in their cha-
rafters ; and the few boned men vivjl abavi- "j"
don such difgraceful connexions. This Cof
fin was naturalized at Baltimoreâand a ze tt
mighty tie our collnt'ry bus on him for pro- p ort
miling and affording hi 111 proteftion and an a
commercial advantages ! Coffin is a true de- re fl e
mocratic expatriatiftâhe would change [ 0 []
countries every day if he could improve his
| opportuniyes for plunder. Jacobins scorn 'j
to be bound by oaths.âCoffin is agent for ; n g )
all the piivateers out of Nantz, and part AS â¢
owner of several out of other French ports anc |
âdeeply interestedâand yet the French | ias
government with unparralleled weakness f ror
or knavery, listened to his libels on the Uni- avc
ted States, and his falfe and ridiculous state
ments ; and (as capt. Glad's deposition J
Hates) at his indance issued the arret rela- AC
tivc to the role d'equipage; ,which has so Cfo,
materially injured our tradeâand violated
the principles of justice. He beaded of be
ing able to get what he pleased done at Pa- ' J
ris and Nantz, and that he procure Â«
(biffed advantage of the Revolution .') the
condemnation of any American vessel for ,
five guineas. Coffin had a regular correspon
dence with people inthiscoiintryâ-fome who P o '
are " naturalized" we suppose ; who are at ;
only waiting an opportunity of miking a
diveftmert of their American citizenlhip a T, ' r
, | rÂ»gans of filling their pockets to flee back a j u
ito France. In a vessel lately arrived at New '*
York, a'number of Coffin's friend# came "
; pafTengersâthey are his true disciplesâthey PÂ°'
â¢ were numerous, and frequently on the paf
-1 sage broke open the hatches, rumaged the J ro
freight, drank and wafted the wine, and drew- P"
p their swords and knives on the captain and J nr
r crewâand sometimes, when liquor Com- P ut
. pletely unmasked the devil, " J wore
. they would set firt to the city" (mean- 0
s I ' n S probably if the citizens of New-York '

VENICE.
(FROM THE BRUSSELS PAPERS.) MeilC
The greatest interests of Europe are ac this
day agitated in Italy. Whatever tends , '
to makt known Italy, and the men who
are acting a conspicuous part there, (hould
be fought for and recorded. A French
journal, printed at Milan.,entitled " France ~,|
viewed by the army of Italy," furnHhs us
with an article calculated to make us bet- 1 j "
tcr acquainted both with the present sit
uation of Venice, and the genius of the
hero who has changed her destinies. The \f â-
municipality of this city had dispatched
to Buonaparte citizen Dandolo : The '
following is the acciJirnt which Dandolo '
gave to the municipality of one of his in- J lO . c
terviews with the deliverer of Italy': 101
I spoke to the general concerning the . re "'
dilapidation of the different forts of timber ln c "
destined for the service of the navy. He
difappvoved of that practice, teftified much j l .?'
interest; refpeflihg the fubjeft, and assured '
me that at Udina he would giveorderi which 0 Â®
(hould be scrupulously refpefted ;he defir-' e
ed me to present him a memorial on the sub- |
. . Lo
" I spoke to him of Ad r ' a > which has p hi e t
ever been considered as an integral part of ed to
the Ex-Dogeate, and at present forms a part
of the department of Padua. He teftified
hie fnrprife at this, questioned general Bara- â- v ,, 5
guey d'Hilliers, and decided that it (hould t [ ca tl
be united to our department. food
" I submitted to him the impoflibility we }>' cn
were under of arming with brass guns, as he
had required, the five (liips which wc were the ;
to furnifh him. He consented that they j W eat
(hould be armed partly with iron guns, and of h
that their armament (hould be completed ' ,e '!v
with brass ones.
" I a(ked him, with the franknefs of a A
re publican speaking to a republican, whether tled
the direftory had consented to the occupy- revo
ing oflftriaand Dalmatia by the Auftri- Thc
ans ? He answered mp, ho ; and as I in
filled on thiÂ«'{joint, lie repeated td' tne so J lei
positively that I was quite persuaded. He of n
questioned me eoscerning the disposition of whi
those provinces, the facility of taking Za-
ra by a landing, and told me to bring hitn
the topographical maps of the country. <â¢
" I informed hiro, that the people of If- kna
tria were very ardent tcbe free, and to be risa
united with Venice ; that the Sclavonians of
the coasts were very discontented with the
. Auftrians, and that the warlike tiation of tiotl
the Albanefe would repel our enemy, with cro'
. all its force. "
"I did not forget to speak to him con- d . 1
ccrning the mufquets of which our national wh
r guards are in such want. He answered me Â«
_ that Venice wss to equip with all speed wh
three battalions of the line, to complete the opt
eighteen, or thereabouts, to be furniftied by
our brethren of Italy ; that three thousand
1 stand of arms would be requifitc for that p r ,
(. pnrpofe, and that we might freely dispose <
; of the remainder.
1 " I spoke to himof the confiscations pro-
1 nounced by our commiflion against some
5 guilty persons, and which meet with diffi- 1
2 cultiea in their execution on the part of the de
constituted authorities of thÂ« other depart- v Â»
1f mentsâof the necessity of a central commit
d tee, conipofed of all the deputies of the e*-j tui
m Venetian (late, to unite its different depart- e d
t. ments, to remedy a thousand evils, and "re
to forma number of particular administrations, ||j
1 - whose operations are very expensive, and of 1
r- little utility. He assured me of his entire br
js consent to all these mpafures, and that in a w
few days I should fee the whole put in exe
id cution. *
re " I informed him of the use we hai made
of the economical, political and commercial
th picture of Venice, the happy result which
by it offered, and the publication we were go- A
ed ing to make of it. He immediately allied
he me for a copy of it, and promised me to ; H
read it with great attention. Fi
" His carriage was ready: he. was going _
us tofetout, when, after having conversed an
hour and a half, he questioned me again con
off cerning the pub'ic spirit which prevailed at
'ajr Venice. A Patriotic Society, well inten
the tioned, and diffufing â¢ Republican energyâ
-2d a Civic Theatre, well diredted, inspiring
if democratic sentiments under the veil of plea
}y > sureâour pubh'c fittings daily enlightening
the people of their true interests, the spirit
\m- which animates us all--âthis, said I, is what
2ge vffiljly civilizes the country, and renews the
m- brilliant days of Its splendour.
' MILAN, Sept. 8.
The People of Udina, finding that the ,
French Commiflioners had imposed a milita
ry contribution upon them which they were
on - not able to pay, sent Deputies to make re
' 1 presentation of their cafe to Buonaparte.
f t he The General advised them to fell the pro
perty of the Church, and apply it to the
ous discharge of the
itu- observed the Deputies, " who will venture
to purchase such property; Will the provi-.
a â fional Administrators take upon themselves
â ill ; to preside at the sale, or to guarantee its
lore validity?"â" E/itirtain no dtftrufl." said
kled Buonaparte, " Tou Jhall certainly be made
that free," It may be inferred from this affur
'Â°r ance, that the French government has deter
tain, mined not to cede any,part of the Terra
and Firma of Venice to the House of Austria,
3 of and that therefore the re-commencement of
