this estate, a large and well built brick huufe, containing
nine commodious rooms, exclufiwe 01 a spacious hall or en
try, si feet Square, two pair of ilaus, suitable aiid conTen
lcut pailages, and excellent dry cellars. It is placed on a
fine lie'lchy eminence, commanding views in
every over th t e towns of 1 redericklburgh and
Falmouth, and an extensive cultivated country. The
grounds aeijuming the house are neatly laid out in pleaf
u.'e esd kitchen gardens intcrlperfea with a variety of
fcarte trees, a choijc collection of flowers and flowering
(hi u'Â»s, and enriched by various forts of the following
fruits, viz apples, pears, walnuts, chefnuts,cherries,peach"
eÂ», plumbs, nad-arines, apricots, grapes, figs, rafberries,
goofebeiries.ftravvherries,and currants; the whule admi
raÃly varied by turfed flÂ«peÂ» which have been lormed by
great labour and eipencs. Bordering upon tbefe im
provements,are fevcrul lots, in a high Hate of Milcivation,
and well let with- red clover and ofcl.ard grass, from
which three heavy crops of hay are tfchen every year. Ad
jacent thereto are two large and flourilhing orchiirds ; cnc
ot well chosen peach trees, the other of apple arid pear,
trees, leleiiedtrom the be iiurlcncs in the ftatc. Pro
perly detached from the raanfion house are .extensive

underneath lor a variety 'of purpoies, a store-house and
Imoke house ail of brick, a dairy and Ipring house of ( tone.

arrangsmeatsfor stock of every delcriptiou, witha large
anu,convenient receptable for provender, from which they
can be furnilhed without being cxpofed to the inclemency
oi the weather. An overseer's houJ u , biacklmith's fliop,
and quarters fufficient to accommodate in the best marw
ner more than fifty labourers.'
The arable lands are fs> advantageouiTy divided as to as.
ford an opportunity of making a large quantity oflndian
corn annually, without bringing the fleldiinto fcnilar cul
ture oftner than once in fnur years ; confequentiy the
lands may be improved by keeping up the inclol'ures during
the intermediate years, or may be beneficially fallowed for
wheat and other grain at tne option of the proprietor.
On the prcmifes there is also a merchant mill with one
pair ot best French burr 1 tones, and one pair of Cologne ;
furnilhed with modern machinery, and now leafed for the
unexpired terpi oi four years, at 1501 per annum, and all
â grain for the ul'e of the farm, hopper free, which is near
ly tool. more, r'h* null and miiler'shoufe are built of
free stone, within a very small distance of navigation, near
to which are two or more valuable lilheries, and a well
accustomed ferry over the Rappahannock to the town of
Frederickfburg. ldÂ« land tontains mexhauftible qua'rrie s
. of free l tone near to the river, is plentifully supplied with
remarkable fine water and pofl'effes a due proportion of
meadow, which by having the command of water may
be confideraoly increal'ed. The roads are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel and sociable. In fa<ft, exelufive of
an improveable and well conditioned farm, the value and
emolument inseparably conneaed witn a mill, ferries,
fifberies and quarries eligibly fltuated ; the profits arinng*
Irom an ice-house inferior to none in the state, and a gar
den of four acres so abundantly ftockcd with vegetables
of all forts as to be fully equal to the demand in market,
thire might be detailed many other advantages, apper
taining to the fertility of theft lands, which the fubferiber
conceives it unnsceffary to mention, being fully convinced
that when examined, it will be found to be a complete,
pleasant and healthy relidence, possessing beauties and'
convenience* fuffieient to attract the attention of any per
son desirous of becoming a purchaler.
The' motive which induces the fubferiber to offer for
sale an estate so Angularly beautiful and adva/itageoas, is
a desire to. become an inhabitant of Alexandria, where he
can with more ease attend to his interests in the neigh
bourhood of that city.
The purchaser may be accommodated with a few slaves
ir. families, either for plantation or domestic use. A part
of the purchafc money will be required and the balance
made easy, the debt being properly secured.

CONGRESS OF the UNITED STATES.
HOUSB OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, January 4, continued.
The report of the committee of Ways and Means
on the fubjeft of the balances due from indivi
dual States to the United State* being under con
federation.
Mr. Gilbert fjud, the proposition offered by the
gentlemr-n from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) however
it might ferveto di/lingui/l the mover, was of such
a nature and complexion, that he was persuaded it
t. otildmtjet with no countenapca from that House;
he thought it ought to be rejected with indignation.
It was true, he said, Virginia, as an individual
debtor Hue. could not be effected by it, as (he h.d
no property in fndh condition. It icemed to him,
he said, altogether unexampled ; and to carry with
1 it a violation of the principles of all public confidence
and good faith ; fir.-h as was aat, at this day, to t>e
paralleled, or juilified hy the practice of any en-
civilized nation on earth. Hi cinfidered,
he said, that the principles of public law, no longer
allowed of (uch praSic., not even in a date of hof
tility between nations. He trusted, he said, that,
the United States, wh"o, by conditution, could only
adt upon individuals, not upon dates, would never
tatnilh its character by such proceedingsânor ex
hibit t<Â» the wbrld faeit evidence of depravity, or so
weak a lenfe of regard to (he common principles of
. confidence, good faith, and morality. He expect
ed, he said, the would be,indantly re
jected. /
M r . Hartley hoped this motion would not be
referred. He thought the meafurl a very Improper
one. It differed eiu:eeding]y from the resolution
reported by the committee ; that contemplated a
friendly requeit to the debtor states.to make pay
ment ; but ihe resolution now offered went to coer
cion immediately. liy our treaty with Great-
Britain, bt public fecu<itic3 were guaranteed, and
not to be attached or leized, upon any pretcnce
vv itever. iSlr-iH we then, said he, treat a fitter state
worfe'tfran a "range nation? He hoped so ungene
rous a would not prevail. He had no doubt
but the date of New-York would be inclined to do
v hat was jnit and light ; and if they objected to
pay, .they would doubtless give their reasons for it.
As to the ftite of Delaware, Mr. H. was of opinian
that (he was unable to pay thexbahnce found a
gaina her. He prefnmed {he would state her ina
'jili'.y, and that relief would be granted her. Ths'
tint Hate, perhaps,'did not advance much money
during the war, yet (he furnifhed more than in pro
portion to her number of citizens. He vas there
fore decidedly againd the refutation.
Mr. Livingfton had no obje&ion to the reference;
becaulc he was curious to hear arguments in sup
port ot 1 his new mode of keeping up harmony be
tween the dates and the United States, It would
doubtless require great ingenuity, and introduce a
new kind of morality and of logic, to prove that
to seize upon the property of a date was to culti
vate harmony with it : for, in hit opinion, the
propsfition was contrary to all (principle and fair
conduit.
Mr. Coit was at a lofi to know the intention of
the mover of the present tefolution, whether it was
to forward or defeat the objeiSt in view. If he in
tended to serve the cause, he would make use of the
fame homely adage in refpedt to him, that he had
done with refpeft to another gentleman, that " he
leaped before he came to the flile."âThe original
refelution, he said, was merely to call upon lite
dates for payment ; but to talk about Seizing their
property, was to suppose they wculd not pay. The
gentlemen of New-York, it was true, had said
much againd thejudiceof the debt but they were
not authoriled to ;tt in the business. Had they
afl<ed for the money ? No. Was it proper, there
fore, in this of the buiincfe, 10 lake such a
dep as was then proposed ! It was even a very feri
ouÂ» queliiwn to determine, whether, in any cafe,
they Ihould be autiiorifed to seize their fundi.
Mr. W. Smith hoped the refutation would not
be committed. He thought they (hould hare more
confidence in the date of New-York, than to sup
pose it would refule to pay its debts. He belicv
ed they would not refufe. Such a IKp at any time
would require much ferrous confederation before it
was adopted. The measure was particularly level
led at the ffste of New York, because if was the on
ly state in that fittiation. Even-were they to refufe
Uj pay, he had great' doubts whether it would be
proper to ittze- ttteir property. The meagre pro-,
posed by the rep rt was moderate, and equal to all
the dehlpr dates, which the mode now offered was
not.
Mr. G ) urn laid the arguments of the gentle-
IT: n from Si. Carolina, were iÂ«thcr againd the re
"folu iÂ«r< itltll, than againd the propriety of cum
liiituiy it, '.)Â«Â«#Â£ Uk gentleman's arguments was
not Jaunded in fast. He had said that the measure
fid affcrr New-York only. But of the fix debt
â  : 3, feur of them' had property in the funds
of the United St- es ; two of them had more than
they owed. Pejinfylvania had fix times as much
n the run .: as 1' was reported to ewe ; therefore
(lie meature could not be singular iowards New-
V >k
t . , Mr. G. said, heconfidered that when a re
mstton w i hid upon the table, the only argument
ft cot. mitting it mud be, that it was evident
i:-)g!y imprudent and improper. As to this
rt.'ohr si betag proper, or improper, prudent or
iri'pruccni, he could not fay, because not under
consideration ; but he thought there was nothing
so glaiingly improper in it, as to prevent difcufli
on.
He said he 1 had only Heard one thing which was
an objection to the motion being committed, which
was from the gentleman from New York. He said
the mealure was difgraceful, and such as woirid not
be adopted by one hodile nation towards another.
That gentleman, Mr. G. said, should recoiled! one
thing. Supposing that it would be difgraceful to
seize the ptoperty ef individuals in the public funds,
on account of any piifcondndt of that nation, yet
there was nothing difgraceful in the measure nbw
proposed. That gentleman had said that no nation
at war would seize the property of thair enemy.
Did nc not know that England had seized all
:Â® French property which they could lay their hands
upon. Here 1 was a state, he said, owed them a
sum of money, and the measure proposed was, to
tffke their property in the funds to pay it. He
-thought there was no difficulty in the cafe, if they
3 supposed the tranfa&ion, to happen betwixt itrdivi
J duals. If a person had hid mortey in his hands,
. and at the fame time owing him money, he (hould
at leatt discuss the matter in his own mir.d, whe
e ther he would let him have t&e money before he
r paid him what he owed. All that was asked, he
h said, was that the matter (hould oe discussed ; if it
; was found improper, it would of course be rejeftej.
Mr, Coit thought there was some differeucc be
u twixt the resolution before them being referred to
a committee of. the whole, and the committee upon
J the fubjeÂ£l of the balances.
Mr. S. Smith said, before quell ion was put,
h ha wiihed to fay a few words on the fubjefif. G en "
e tlemcn might fay they would lay hands 011 the pro
c perty of the state of New York. The gentlemen
. fri>m thence had said, that date fliould not pay the
| debt. But Maryland, he fqid,. would pay ; and
r (he depended on the iwiereft of her (lock in the
funds of the United States to p3y her ciril lift. If
j they chose to seize the funds of New-York, why
y fliould they leize those of Maryland ? Maryland,
r he said, was every year purchaiing frefe dock. At
this time, he believed, Maiyland had money to lay
0 out in these docks. A resolution fcf this kind, he
,f said, would make it poffibleJor the United Stales
. to seize the property of dates without right. He
thought payment (hould firft be aflced. Until this
was donej they (hould not take a dep of this kind
e which would have a tendency to defttoy the public
r faith. He hoped, therefore, that the resolution
n would not be committed, as ke would not have it
a supposed possible that the United States would at
_ anytime seize property which had been lodged fer
. security in their hands.
Mr. Nicholas said if the motion could have the
J effedt the gentleman mentioned, be would withdraw
e it. He thought it might be so modified as that
e such an effect Could not even be supposed HÂ«
. said he had heard no objeÂ£iens to hi* motion which
t had had any weight with him. He should not, as
3 had been insinuated by the gentleman from Naw
j York, use either new logic or fine words; but it
. was his opinion the measure would prevent the paf
-1 fions of the people from being raised ; as it was
. not likely that men (hould embedy their Force,
when it could have no effect. He did not think it
â¢ was proper to interfere with the proptrty of Mary
s land. He meant this measure only as an eventual
. security.
The motion was put and negatived, 42 to 3J.
The house then went into a committee of the
. whole on the original report, Mr. Muhlenberg in
the chair, when
M'\ Read hoped the resolution would be agreed
| to. He laid he had attended to all the objections
1 which had been made to the measure, and they did
â¢ not appeal to him to have any real weight. They
. were principally these.: It was said by some the
. debt was not justly due. that the lule of appor
tionment was not what it ought to have been ; and
â¢ that it was not iB the power of the United States
â  to enforce payment of the debts. The resolution
, was alfooljeited toon the ground of policy.
With relpeft tothe judise of the fettlementi he
did not believe that the debtor dates would pre
tend that tfie debts were not justly due, and there
fore ihe arguments on this head were of no weight,
| aÂ»they ought not to anticipate such a conduct.
. With refpefit to the power to coerce, it was frivol
ous in the extreme to talk of this. It was suppos
ing the debtor dates to object to the demand,
whereas they pretended bo such thing. He believed
the debtor dates w mid pay. With refped\ to the
policy of the measure, it was his opinion that there
was no better policy in either dates or individuals
than to pay their debts, if bur government, he
said, was founded upon erroneous principles, vicious |
mei.furcs might be rieceffary; but so long as it was
founded on equal rights and privileges, there could 1
be no founder policy than to auke ju.lice auU equi
ty our guide.
It had been supposed thtt tha state of New-York
would not pay her debt j that she would herftlf
less friendly to the union, lei's federal, than others.
He did not believe this, believed the state perfectly
federal. Would not the fame argument fall upon the
creditor states ? Were theytooaiit tailing upon the
ri btor states, would not the creditor dates be disappoin
ted by these debts not being paid ? Would rt not have
a tendency to make them less friendly, lets federal,
were they to be called upon for money which the debt
or states ought to have paid ?
Air- R. said it was clear, upon the principles of po
licy and juflice, the application ought to be made at
this time. The longer perfons'negledfed to pay any
just debt, the more unwilling they were to pay, and
the difficulty of recovering it, increased in proportion to
the delay.
In refpeff to the state of Maflachufe'tts, which he had
the honour to reprefi,nt, it was one- of tile creditor
Hates. It was at present burdened with very large
debts, contracted in support of the war. per
sons expeffed, and perhaps the state in general, that
their accouut would be allowed, ihe Jrijount was
1,100,000 dollars. They supposed this sum would be
paid by the dobtor dates, and if it were not paid, it
would make a direil tax very unpopular with them.
There had been Jn objection urged by the gentle
man from New-York ( Mr. Williams) which he tho't
hÂ«d not been noticed. He said there had beeu large
emigrations from other states into that state liace the
settlement of the accounts, which had so increased
their population, as to have greatly increased their debt,
that being edimatei on a scale of population. If it
was true that such an emigration ha 4 taken place, and
he expected it was, it enritfheu the state of New-York,
and enabled her to pay the debt. The people knew
when they went into that state that they would have to
bear a part of the debt. They had left creditor states
and by these emigrations of young and enterprrzing
men, those states were impaired, the aged and infirm
being left behind.
Mr. R. concluded by faying, that it was evident the
money was due, and it was proper requisition should be
made for payment, and he doubted not it would be
complied with.
Mr. Freeman-said he was in favour of the resolution.
It was Agreed on all hands that revenue was wanted,
and the people in the creditor states were extremely
diflatisfied that the debtor states had not yet paid their
balances. Indeed, he could fee nojuftice in calling
upon the creditor states for a direst tax to pay the
interest of a debt due from certain states in the union.

CONTINUATION OF
Late Foreign Intelligence.
From the Lor.dan Gazette Extraordinary.
Parliament-Street, November 3, 1796.
A dispatch, of which the following is a copyÂ»
was this day received by the right honourable Hen
ry Dundas, one of his raajefty's principal feorefa
rieS of state, from rnajer-geriaral Craig, command
ing his majelly's troops at the Cape of Good Hope,
dated Camp on the (bora of Saldanha bay, August
19, 1796.
SIR,
1 have great fatisfa&ion in reportingto you the
event of an attempt which has been made by the
enemy, and which has termjnated to the honor of
his majefly's arms, in the entire capture of the
squadron of Dutch ships of war, deltined for the
purpose of retaking this settlement.
Having made every arrangement within my
means, by the establishment of a imall poll, and
the laying the road by a fufficient number of the
few men which 1 had been able to mount, tor
watching Saldanha bay, I received a report an the
3d inttant, transmitted in fourteen hours, that line
ships had appeared off that coast oÂ« the preceding
afternoon, which I immediately communicated to
vice admiral fir George Keith ElphinJtone. By
the fame report there appeared to at the Itrongeit
probability that his majelly's brig the Hope, had
been captured by them ; and as there was no fur.
ther account of them the next day, I concluded
that the information which they had received, by
that means,of our lirength here, had induced them
to continue their route, and that they would Hand
far to the westward before they doubled the Cape,
to avoid fir George's Sect, which had put to sea at
soon as was poflible after the receipt of the intelli
gence.
In order, however, to omit no precaution, I sent
up lieutenant M'Nab, with a few mounted mÂ«n, to
watch the bay more narrowly ; and from him 1 re
ceived a report, on Saturday night the 6th inliant,
at twelve o'clock, that the fame number of ships
which had formerly been reported, had anchored
that morning in the bay, and that theie was no
doubt of their being enemies. I 101 l not a moment
in fending dire&ions to Simon's Town, from
whence, by the general willingness and activity
which prevailed amongst all renks, five vefTels win e
dispatched by nine o'clock, in quefl of the admiral,
with the information.
As it fortunately happened that the 2jth and
27th light dragoons, with part of the 19th, and
the whole of the 33d regiments, were in Simon's
bay, 1 eould be under no apprehenfiou for the fafe
ty of the coiony from any force which could be lan
ded from nine ships of war. It became, however,
ao ebje&'ef infinite importance to the welfare of
the settlement to pi event any body of the ensmy
from throwing therpfelvej into the coantiy. At
the fame time the security of the Cape Town be
camc jB object of particular attention, both from
the reasonable expetlation, that the enemy would
not have ceme with filch a force without a profpeft
of a jundioa with forae other armament, and from
the possibility of the admiral being prevented from
doubling the Cape by the North Wctlerly winds
which vfaal'y prevail qt this season, and which
would carry the enemy infix hours from Saldanha
to Table bay. It was therefore with particular
fatisfattion that I found myfclf poffciled of a force
adequate to both these objects.
No time was lolt in making the neeeffary ar
rangements in a country totally unused to a move
ment of this nature, The tiooptt began their march \
on Sunday morning, nectfTarily by divisions, on ac
count of fyhfiflenceC The BUrgher Senate was af
lembled, to whom I Â«<pofed rr.y intentions, to
which they exprefied the moll ready compliance.
Waggons Were every where demanded by them,
and fyrnifhed with chearfulnefs. Cavalry was ne
eeffary, but the appointments Â©f the 28th wct\j or*
board a Alio which had failed in quelt of the admi
ral. Thole of the 25th were alio on board a Ship
in Sifnon's bay, and we had not above fifty
The appointments were brought up, and I did not
scruple, on such an occafibn, to require all faddle
horfes without exception to be brought in, which
were valued by two members of the court of jus
tice, and (wo officers of the 28th dragoons, ana
paid for on the spot to the entire fatisfattion of the
owners.
By these means, fir, leaving major-general Doyle
in the command of the iroops at and about Cope
town, amounting to near 4000 men, r.nd briga
dier-general Campbell in the immediate command
of the town, I, on the morning of the i(sth inft.
leached Saldanha bay, at the headof the advanced
guafd, confining of the light-infantry, a body of
Hottentots, and fifty of 1114.25 th light dragoons,
a (filled by brigadier-general MÂ«.Benzie, the remain
der of whefe corps, confiding of the grenadiers, the
78th and Beth battalions, fifty more of the 25th,
and one hundred of the 28th light dragoom, in all
about 2500 men, with two howitzeis, and nine
field pieces, arrived theie also iB an hour after.
In ihe mean time the "admiral had â¢ returned to
I'alfe bay, and on there Veceiving the firfl accounts
of the enemy being in Saldanha bay, had pu* to
sea again with the utmost expedition ; and we had
the fatisfaClion, from ihe heights from whence we
defceiioed to the shores of the bay, to fee him, with
all his fails crowded, advancing-with a. fair wind
diredlly tu tha mouth of the harbour, though flill
at some diflance. One of the enemy's frigates,
which lay near the fliore to cover their watering,
cannonaded us very briskly as we defceuded' the *
heights, though without effeil, and/we returned
their fire with as little, having at that time only
three pounders with us; a howitzer being
brought up, a few shells were thrown wi.h great
precilion by captain Robertfon, who would prol.a
bly foon'have destroyed her; but perceiving that
our fleet then entering the bay, and :lfat there
was no poifibility of her escaping, I defilied from
firing, thinking it more for his majefty'a intereil
that fhe-fyould share the fÂ£te of tl\e remainder of
the squadron, the capture of which appeared to me
inevitable, tuaii that we should the destroyingher, ftom a vain punsilio of obliging her to flrike
to us We then employed outfelves in making the
neoefTary difpofitinnt for affording such afisftance as
rfciaht be in our p >wer, in the event of the
cy of the enemy obliging the admiral to attack
them, as well as such as \aouM be expedient in cale
tney should run heir lliips on shore, neither of
wliie , however, I thought probable.
1 was accordingly informed, by a letter from fir i
George the following morning, that the whole had
surrendered themselves to him. ,
The means by which this event has been actom
plifhed, fir, has not afforded any npportanity to his
majelly's troops of displaying that bravery in his i
service, which I am consent they would have 1
(hewn, had the occasion presented itfelf: but if thr i
Btmoft alacrity and chearfulnefs, under almost eve i
ry privation, except that of meat, during a march i
of nine r miles, through so barren 3 country that 1
> there exid but five houses in the whole line, have 1
any mrpit, 1 can with truth present them to his ma- i
jelly's notice. ,
This march. Sir, has never yet I believe been at- 1
fempted by any body of troops, Jiowever small, and,, ,
permt me to allure yon, has been attended with such
uncommon difficulties, that it never could have been
aecornphfhed but by the difj;lay of the qualities I have
mentioned in the troops, and a union of extraordinary
exertions ir. all the departments coneerned. In these
all have equal claim to my acknowledgements ; but
I cannot dispense with particularizing the intelligence
and afiivity -with which, regardless of the uncommon
fatigue which attended it, Jieutenant M'Nab, of the
98th regiment, with about twenty of his mounted men
performed the service allotted to him of uatching the
enemy, and preventing any communication with them,
from the firft moment of their coming into the Bay,
till our arrival.
It is, Sir, with very particular fatisfa&ioa that I ,
kave further to report, that P have received, on this
eceafion, every possible assistance from his Majelly's
fubjefls of the colony.
The Bnrgher Senate have discharged the duty impof
edapon them with the greatest readiness, impartiality
and aflivity, whilst their requisitions and orders 011 the
inhabitants for their waggons, cattle and horses, have
been complied with, with a chearfulnefs which could,
I am fatisfied, only proceed from a convii3ion of the
preference to be given of his Majesty'Â» mild and pater
nal government over the wild system of anarchy and
eonfufion from which they were furnilhing the means
of being effe&ually defended.
This will be delivered to you, Sir, by my Aide-de-
Camp, Captain Bayaes, who ha< been in this country
finee the firft arrival of his majesty's troops under my
command, and to whose intelligent and atftive affift
ancel have been, on every nfc.ifion, highly indebted.
I beg leave, Sir, rnoft humbly to recommend him to
his majesty's notice.
I have the honor to be, with the greatest refpe<sl,
Sir, &c. J. H. CRAIG.

PARTY SPIRIT.
The numerous virulent pieces that pass between
men of different parties, cannot but be disgusting
to every unbiassed reader ; and indeed these elfufions
of spleen have beccmr so common, that they seem
now to be generally palled over without regard, and
serve erily to fill the corner of a newspaper without
any-benefit to those who read them.
The liberty of the press, which ought to be
prized by every freeman, Ihonli at the fame time
be used with such moderation as to exclttdc all un
necelfary satire. One of the great parpefes of a
free press is to secure tlje liberty of a country, in
any critical time, by a candid and ingenious display
of principles, and to wÂ»rn its citizens of any Jaagers
that may chance to threaten them from ambitious
tÂ»en ; but it is sometimes so much abused by the
little politicians of a country, that many who are
otherwise welt disposed to the public welfare, are
led to wish that 110 such liberty of the press existed.
This is not indeed a wish cherished by myfclf, nor
even by a majority of society ; bat luch intemper
ance will sometimes be attended with this conse
quence, and if these fierce political champions have
ttally the happiness of their country fa much at
heart as they pretend, it might afford some induce
ment for :t hem to fopprefs their acrimony, to con
fidtr how easily mankind are sometimes prevailed
upon to give up a privilege for the fake of fafety,
and how freqaently nations are epflaved by ambi
tious men, who take advantage of their evils to
eaforce the necessity of more restraint.
1 have been led to these remarks, Mr. Printer,
>r the numerous " hints'* and "communications"l
that have tlruck my attention upon taking up a
newspaper. If the motive of these writers be ta
refotm errors, and do away prejudice, there is to be
sure fottie excuse for there ; but fti-H we are left to
lament that such inadequate means should be used,
as the method they take has quite a contrary tend- j
enpy ; and the breach between different parties, !
instead of being dosed, is made wider. The natural
pride of man induces him to rejeil advice, even tho'
hekuowsit to be given with good intentions; but
when it is accompanied with insult, it will lead him
to embrace the mod palpable errors with more cager
ttefs than he did before, and to difleminate them
amongst others, iif order to vindicate his own un
dei (landing in having firft admitted fhem-
But I am inclined to'think, fir, that their vietfi
are different. They probably mean nothing more
than to >;ive to the public lome bright fpecimcn of
wit, w power -of sarcasm; bat'let me ask any one
jÂ»ho thus frivoleufly wastes liis time and paper,
whetlier he htmfelf has ever received any pleaftire
from l:he perusal of similar pieces ? If their objedt
is to entertain, they should be more pointed ; for no
person is amused by general censure. Is any criti
cism agaiirft ar'tjjoerals or demoirats (tetmi that
cetirprife great numbers) calculated to please a
reader who undcrftands not,to whom they are par
ticularly _aimed ? 1 believe not, and if .the writers
who arc so ready to (hew their smartness, would
apply the enquity to their own feelings, the event
wou.ld be fufficient to baffle their hopes of diftinc
tioÂ»i from this source, and spare the public the talk
of <perufwg compoGtions that yield neither pleasure
nor information.
In satire that is personal, the cafe it different ;
i#ir here we are jfcrhaps acquainted with the cha
mbers.; and we are gratified in watching the ar
rows of reproach that fly from fide to fide, becautft
we know the objedt en whom they fall, and their
fate is iateteliin^.
Thus it appears, Mr. Pripter, that no msr> ought â 
to present his eff.iys to his fellow citizens, unless it
to communicate something valuable, or some
thing pleasing. For this rftfon I have always been
â ed todefpife the produ&ions of a writer, that denis
in mere abuse without argument, aÂ«d look upon it
as nothing more than a prostration of the purposes
for which the freedom of ttie prefj is designed. I
may by this means indulge my own malignity against
a particular party, but cannot hope to convince
other men ; and for what other purpose is it tha'
I publiih my reientment ? The man who wishes to

that Â«ur river will frozen, Cipt. Woodman landed

COM MVNICA TIONS.
The traitors by whose advice the Frenek.continue

SEASONABLE REMARK.
A can'ing set of men are at wotk t* impose si
lence on the independent language of the country
refpefting its violated rights, which at last, though
very late in the day, iflTues through the newspapers.
We *re told the power of France is net to be re
filled and must be foethed, courted and teneiliated.
We mull not use any language but conciliation, Jcc.
The answer to this hypoorify is plain and (hort ;
plundered men will complain and have a right â
nor can the editors of newspapers Another itJ
When Britain seised fon<- millions, these very men,
who now speak in whispers, would have thundered
from the cannon's mouth. Eight or perhaps ten
millions ate leized by France, now they fay suppli
cate. Inconfillency ! But the chief remark to be
made is thisâthe belief of the Diredtory that we
arc more French than American, has milled them
to aft in this violent way. \ The American rene
gadoes in Paris, and their afloeiates the club here,
have made the French imagine that all America
would turn Jacpbins and the government would
tumble dawn into the very miri, if they, the
Frertcb, would threaten a and if that
foiled would plunder the merchants who promoted
the Britilh treaty. This being the cafe, it is the
daty of the crirts Â«n every real patriot to (hew a
merited fÂ»pport of the governme.itâan indignant
lenfe of the injury, and a spirit that will a(k for
i rsdrefs. thougii it nay refrain from either uienace6
'or reprisals. If the Dire&ory of France should
fee as they mull, that our people are friends to out
government and no longer their dupes, they, will
change their fyllem which was produced by, and
founded os,. jjthe miflake falfe-heartcd Americans
have led them into.
House of ReprefentahDft of the United States.
Thtufday, January 19, 1797.
The following communication was received from
the Prefrdent of the United States ; together with very
voluminous documents therein referred to, which af;er
some debate on the propriety of the measure, were or
dered to be printed without being read :
Gentlemen of the Senate,
and of the House of Feprefentitives,
At rhe opening of the present fcflion of Congress, I
mentioned that some circumllam.cn of an unwelcome
nature had lately occurred in relation to France ; that
our trade had fuffered and was fuffering extenGve in
juries in the Well-Indies from thÂ« cruisers and agents
of rhe French Republic ; and that communications had
been received from its minister here which indicated
danger of a further diilurbar.ee of our commerce by its
authority, and that were in other refpe&s far from
agreeable ; but that I refervid for a fpecral meflage a
more particular commuuication on this interesting fub
je<SâThis communication I now make.
The complaints of the French minister embraced
mofl of the tranfa&ions of our government in relation
to France, from an early period of the present war ;
which therefor* it was neceflary carefully to review.
A collection has been formed of letters and papers rela
ting tfrthofe tranfaflions, whieh I now lay before you,
with a letter to Mr. Pinckney, our minister at Paris,
containing an examination of tke notes of the French
minister, and fuÂ«h information as I thought might be
ufefnl to Mr. Pinckney in any further representations
he might find necessary to be made to the French go
vernment. The immediate object of his million was
to make to that government fucli explanations of the
principles and conduA of our own, as by manifeftiug
our good faith might remove all jealousy and.difcen
tent, and maintain that harmony and good understand
ing with the French Republic which has been my con
ftaut folisitude to preserve. A government which re
quired only 1 knowledge of the truth to juftify its mea
lures, could not but be aftxious to have this fully and
frankly dilplayed.
Go: WASHINGTON.
United States, January 19, 1796.
The house went into a committee of the whole on
the fubjeiSl of future revenue, Mr. Dent in the chair,
when a long, but some what irregular debate took place,
in the cotirfc of which two or ttireoPdifferent amend
ments were proposed and negatived. At length the
quellion on the relolution for laying a tax'on la>id was
put and carried by a considerable majority, there being
56 in favour of it, and 54 in favourof that for laying
a tax on (laves. The committee rose, reported the
relolution, and obtained leave to fit again. The house
relumed, and amotion was made to take up the rcfo
lutions, but it was negatived 47 to 37.

TO THE PUBLIC.
JAMES <?tREY, No. 83.North Second Strfft, and
JOHN MARKLAND, No. 91, South Front Street,
Printers, have entered into partnerQ'.ip, under the firm
of CAREY & MARKLAND, for ths of pub
lishing an Evening Newspaper In this City, under the
title of
The Daily Advertiser,
The firft number of which will appear on WEDNES
DAY the firft ef MARCH next.
PROSPECTUS of th, WO R K.
I. Besides the usual feledtiSa ot intelligence, foreign
anddomeltic, The DAILY ADVERTISER will be en
riched with fech other articles as may tead to the im
provement and rxteufioc of our commerce, agriculture,
manufactures, arts and feiencea, 3cc. &e. nor fliall the
less profitable, though highly pleating walks of roblTC
LiTERATURe, be wholly unfrequented ; as its pages will
occasionally be variegated and enliv.ncd from thÂ« {tores
ef hiltory, travel, biography, anecdote, &<-. as well as
the lighter effufions of fenlimeot, wit, humour, and
pleasantry, in mole and verse
11. The DAILY ADVERTISER will be open for
caadid and liberal difculÃon, on both fides of every po
litical question which may interest the public mind. It
will likewise contain such extracts frompartj papers and
pamphlets, oa both fides, as may fcrve to develop the
plans and condttil of each âThis part of the gent â **1 de
lign, should it even fail of effecting its prime objeit, that
of lefiening the fervor of political zeal, will, at least,
difleminate that general knowledge of the best interafte
of society and the public weal, so eflential to every citi
zen of a free and enlightened country.
111. The DAILY ADVERTISER will eontaifl a full
and regularly digested MARINE LIST formed upon tha
plau of tile London LLOYD'S LIST, and a variety of 0-
ther commercial intelligence; so that the mercantile read
er may obtain at a {ingle glance that information which
he has hitherto been obliged, and often in vain, to seek
thro'a large and confufed mass of mifeellaneous matter.,
IV. The pages of this' paper will he numbered, and tho
Suhfcribers furniflied yeaily, with A COMPLETE AND
COPIOUS INDEXâThis part of the plan, which will
be faithfully executed, mutt render a volume of tbefc
papers of more value than the original fubfeription.'
Thus have the Editors briefly fketehed out the LEAD
ING FEATURES which lhall mark their intended pub
lication, to which they solicit a (hare of that publie pa
tronage and encouragement without which the moil ju
dicious plau and the greatest exertions mult become e
qually abortive and unprofitable.
To defervethat support which they now solicit, they
will leave nothing uneflayed which may be compassed by
the molt unremitted industry and liberal expenditure.
CONDITIONS OF PUBLICATION.
1. The DAILY ADVERTISER will be neatly and
oorreflly printed in Folio, on fine ror.il paper and with
â new ypes. It will be distributed every day (Sunday
excepted) at the ufaal li&ur in the evening.
The annual subscription will be only fix dollarsâ
the firft half years fubfoription to be paid on fubferihing
or in three months from the commencement of the paper.
Afterwards to bt paid hilf yearly in advance.
3. Advertisemints will bs confpiuoafly displayed,
carefully corrected, and inserted upon moderate terms.
gj" Until the editors can procure a convenient central
situation to confelidate their bufmefs, they will receivc
fubferiptionsand advertisements at their refpe&ive houfao
Ne. 83, N Second-llreet, and No. 91, S. Front-street,
from the latter of which the paper will be published.
N. B. They will iflue an AVANT COURIER of
the fee, typi, paper, and plan of the Daily Advertiser,
a vyeek or ten days before the publication of the firft
number, which will be diflributed gratis, to enable the
public iÂ»i form a decided opinion on the merits of the
undertaking.

grantÂ«eÂ«of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and personal estates he conveyed away to
his fon-in law and so his children was the result of
a deliberation had upon the fubjedl by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan ami P Moore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confided in the fubferibers by
those creditors: a step which it would have been a,
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very statement of the fait therefore mull dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindictive." It originated in a desire to feoure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fanftioned by the
advice of council as a measure nccejjary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advertilement has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjulliiiable condutt, not to the fub
feiibers .vho have merely published the truth in
terms as mild as the fait would admit, and who
mean to investigate in a high court of justice the
validity of those purcbafes of which Mr. M'Cle
nachan so confideir.ly speaks.
The fubferibers therefore are bound \>y a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
emiiion against purelialing of those grantees or
either of them, and to extead the terms of it to a
purchase from any other persons (if such there be)
to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made firailar
conveyance's.
