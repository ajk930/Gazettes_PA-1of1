MY CWfTTRTKUM, I â¢" T
The season of indifference is padâthere
is no longer security in a ftateof in-adionâ
If once deluded by the hope that the juftict
of France, and a recolledion of former
friendfliips would finally triumph and recon
cile our countries ; wc must now turn from
the delulivc fight and prepare for an inevita
ble cenfcquence. The powerful irapulfe of
"gratitude exists in your breads warmed with
all the zeal of enthofiafmâthe polTcflion
does you honorâit is the attribute of a libe
ral mind.
But my countrymen, Vour dear bought
independence must not lose a single tittle of
its privileges ; pofteirity have a claim upon it
as found and unimpaired as at its birthâthe
injustice and haughty pride of Fran.ce de
mand an absolute iurrender of that indepen
dence- whilft your own pretended patriots
ftcond the imperious call under this specious
form, that you are indebted to that country
for your freedom and should repay her by
facrificing your sacred and Inalienable rights
and thus commit thefouleft treafonâtrtafon
to yourselves. I grant you have received
from her eflential'fervices, bat (hould be far
from acknowledging that th')Cs services con
ttituted so important â¢ debtâFads conira
did the aflertionâone half the work of our
independence was fkiifhed before (he gave us
afiiftanceâthe capture of Burgoyne ilampt
the fate of the couteft.
But for thÂ« aid /he lent you, have you
not on every occasion evinced your gratitude j
and shown an attachment to the revolution ?
did not President Washington in a speech to
Mr. Adet declare his warmed wiflies for
their success and that the American govern
ment fympathizedwith them in all their mis
! fortunes? These fentimentswould have con
j tinued to this day had not the infradion of
your rights, the capture of your vtffels,
the insults to your flag, ministers and citi
zens roused the indignation of the people
and government, and excited apprehensions
fjer your independence.
And even after this catalogue of indig
nities the door of conciliation is not fl>ut ;
but a forbearance exercised that every other
nation but France mighc have looked sot in
vain. But she was not content with these
proofs of attachment to her cause ; the on
ly obcs which America in her situation could
-i-with iuftice to her own citizens intereli and
j honor give. She willied to pTunge you in
a war that has already exhausted so much of
, the blood and treasures of Europe. -Dif
.' appointed in this expedation by the wisdom
and firmnefs of the federal government, they
have now become your bitterest: enemy,
plundetiug your commerce and sowing dis
contents among you.
I believe, my fellow-citizens, that the
condud of France towards this country has
i) chiefly arisen from the misrepresentations of
j some Americans here, (unworthy of the
name) refpedingyoiir feijtiments of (he con
stitution, Ptefident apd adininillratiop.â
These evil disposed persons have defcrilaed
themselves as a strong existing party, who
would faciifice the dignity and independence
of their native country to th? ambition of
that republic.
That there are some men with minds so
debased arid hearts so callous to the ties of
' nature and calls of patnotifm I firmly belipve
' and it is againll fnch I wish to warn you, â
\ But that there il a large portion of our fel
low citizens so degenerate, I could never
admit without a conflid wo/fe than death.
My countrymen,' I flatter myfelf, have too
much regard for their inherent rights ever to
cringe to any nation under heaven.
Banith, my friends, from your confidence
those dtfigning hypocrites who delight in
I painting the power and wisdom of France
and your own weakmtfsâwho declaim a
! gainit the President and government as sub
servient to Britifli influenceâwho affed ap
prehensions for your liberties from the pre
tended encroachments of the Executive
e branchâsuch men are your moll dangerous
foesâunder the imposing name of patriots
they would rob you of every privilege' ot
freemen, to lay you the feet of France.
Be assured they have their ends to answer-;
France is not indifferent to the furtigation
of this country âit is promised her by these
base Americans ; and they will receive theii
reward reaped from yeur wretchedness and
* raifery.
; Judge for yourselves, look into the tran
if fadions of the government and examine
C whether a single article of the treaty hai
been infringed. There are certain limit!
prescribed to the presidential power which
every American may be acquainted with
it will* be an easy bufioefs to ascertain whe
ther they Vive been violatedâfee for yout
selves and be no longer imposed upon.
'â¢ Was not the administration of the iUuf
trious Waihington, who so justly pofleficc
Jt your confidence and affedion, branded b)
ie these artful men as arbitrary and unconftitu
f - tional ? Can you then cxped that the pre
fent executive {hould go pneenfured ?
Depend upon it the moment is come whet
;1 evary individual muli rally round the cpnfti
it tutionâthe approaching storm is a trerr.en
]t dous one and vll require the exertions o
II us all to bear up ag-tinll it. If you are difu
nited the pr'Â»e and boast of America wii
fall vidims to its fury ; but if ur.itc3 yo:
will rife above the malice Â«f you io?s and
bid defiance to their power.

ft may also contribute to their ir.itrjtticjn,
t)y shewing them to what lengths of absur
dity, inconsistency and wickedncfj men may
be carried, when they difeard truth and
principle, and give themfrlves up to the in
fluence of party pjflions, and JAj-intereJl.
This singular paper is the nrport ot a com
mittee of the Georgia Legislature, tailing
itfelf " tfte committee on the state of the
Republic." This committee, it seems,
was apppinted to csafider of the propriety
of running a line between the United SlateÂ«
and the Sreek Indians ; which line was a
greed 011 by the treaty held with those In
dians at New-York, under the authority us
the United States. " The committee on
the state of the republic" has difcoyered,
in its wifdqm, that it would not be " con-
Uflent with found policy, and the true in
terest of Georgia, under present circumstan
ces" to run this line ; and tme of the chief j
reasons for this opinion iÂ« that the line affe&s 1
the jnlprelt of the State of Georgia, which
never acquiejced in the treat V it was
established. I fhal) make no remark on the i
idea of withholdingthe execuUanof a treaty ;
because its provisions are impoliticâthat ig j
perfectly Jackfonian. Neither (hall lat
present dispute the right of the ftateof Geor
gia to que (lion the " policy" of a treaty en
tered into by the general government, to
which the fule andexiluftve right of making j
treaties, both with the Indian tribes and with
Foreign nations, is expressly given by the
constitutionâthat again is quite Jackfoni
an. I (hall equally omit any observations
on what is said in the report about plighted
Jaith und bonaJide contraSs by that very fac
tion which some time ago burnt their own
records, and declared void a sale, while
they refufed to give back the purchase mo
ney : Ads truly Jackfonian, and not ta be
wondered at, when done either by him or
Jaciall Jimmey. But what Ido wonder at,
! and must remark, and mast remark on, iÂ»,
' that this wife and -well informed committee
(hould declare that Georgia never acquief
' ced in the treaty of New-York with the
1 Creeks ; and that the wife and well inform
| thgy weieappoiiited feould
,' have adopted their te ore. This declarati
i on is so far from being that at the ve
: ry next feflion of the Georgia Legislature,
which was held after the treaty in question
took place, that legislature formally and ex
pressly ratified the treaty ; An ad no doubt
unnecessary in itfelf ; but conclusive as t,o
the faÂ£t which Jackali Jimmey and his com
-1 mittee have afTerted, and the present en/ight
i ened and well informed Legislature of Geor
gia has fandioried by adopting the report.
Quere âhad they not better proceed to burn
that part of thjeir records which contains
' this ratification, in order to preserve consist-

= ' Mr. Day,
, r '|| old Maa ; tike an old Man pcrroi<
p,,_ me to tell a taleâl recollctt a dispute whic'4
the happened when I was a boy between twq
Ijl- vet> worthy nitn, who livpd in mySacs* /
I
borhood, St whom I snail sot di(l:tt&ion fake
call George an J Lewis.
It happened that 'George had been for
sometime engaged in a lawsuit with one of
hisneighboÂ»s,wiomllhaUcall John,and who
poffetfed a grill thill ; this John was purse
proud and bid f-.-qoently overturned carts
going to and from other peoples mills in the
neighborhood ; he low alledged, that a
greeably to the title deeds by which George
held his fends, he and his tenants were ob
liged to bring all their grain to hi/ mill to
be ground ; this George denied, faying he
had good right t* carry his grift to what
mill he pleased ; on this they joined iiTue,
and to law they went | but John, being a
man of great influence,and having the long
est purse, was likely to bear very hard up
on his antagonist ; whereupon George ap
plied to his heighbor Lewis, who was like
wise a man of riches and influence* to assist
himâLewis, for sometime hesitated, but at
length he began to reason thus; âThis fame
neighbor John is becoming too powerful, if
he should succeed in this suit, he may take
it in his head to compel others to go to his
mill likewise, and by this means mine,
may be left idle ; now if I Ihould lend George
Inont-y to enable him to go oil with his fnit,
and assist hiai with my interest, and he
Â« should gain fciÂ« cause, he cannot in grati
tude go to any other mill but mine thereaf
ter ; I will assist him. He accordingly lent
George a confidernble fnm of moneyâwith
this ftipply, and w{th the Lew
is's interest at court, George soon after ob
tained a determination in his favor.â'From
this time George and Lewis became warm
friends ; they ,were as we fay hand and
glove with each other ; they likewise enter
ed into an agreement to"render each other
every aÂ£l of kindness iu tbe.r power, and
that the carts of either party loaded with
grain should not be injured or obftrufted by
the other party on the high road, whether
the grain with which they were loaded was
the produce Of their bwn or any other
neighboring farms, or going to or coming
from what mill or market they pleaftd.
In process of time a difputcarofe
John 8c Lewis about the property of their
refpeStive farms ; the dispute became warm;
at length tlit-y dctei mined to decide it by
I2W ; the exprnfes of the law ran high, and
the dif|jutSnts were obliged to fell their
'grain to pay the fees ; this they imprudent
ly die},till tiey bbth found their families on
tbe brink of ftarvatjon ; they tben both
applied to George for grain, who permited
his tenants to carry what they had ta spare
t<? Jofin's mill if they thought properâbut
knowing he was indebted to Lewis, and
being grateful for former favours, he made
extraordinary exertions to furnifh supplies
for his family,, and not only a (lifted him in
procuring graim but set himfelf to work,
coilt&ed money and rapid Lewis his debt
ever, before it became dtte, this money Lew
is was permitted to by out in grain and
carry to his-trtfil in George's carts'âat this
John took umbrage and his servants with
hispermiffionfreqaently overturned George's
carts when he found them carrying grain
to Lewis's millâOf this George complain
ed, and sent one of his servants to John to
remooftrate against it : John alledged that
tbe carts which had been pverfet were lsa
ded with grain belonging to Lewis with
whom he was at law, that he had therefore
a right according to the laws of the country
a right which' he would never give up, to
overturn carts ltad'cd with Lewis's grain
whereverhe met then". Hefaidfurther,that if
George could make it appear thathis servants
had overturned,iny carts which were loa
ded with George's own grain he would im
mediately pay forit, on this they agreed-
When Lewis'heard they had agreed, he
was highly di'fpleafed, he said George was
ungrateful, 3fter tbe services he had ren
dered him to enter into an agreement with
any man with whom he was at law, and that
as George had agreed that John had a right
to overturn any carts be (hooW meet with
on the highway loaded with grain,
so he would take the fame liberty with
John's grain, notwithflanding his agree
ment to the contrary.; he accordingly ordered
his servants to overset every cart belonging
to George they met with if loaded with
John's grain, and it so happened that Lew
is's servants in the lieighth of their zeal
â charged al mod:'" -tvery cart they met with
beiug loaded with John's grain,, and there
upon overset them. Furthermore Lewis
forbade George to fend his grain to John's
mill, or to permit his tenants to carry theirs
of this George's tenants complained bitter
ly, for it so happened that it was more con
venient to carry the grain from a considera
ble part of George's ellate to John's than
to Lewis's millâBut George forbad his
servants to prevent the servants of Lewis
from overfeting their carts, faying, Lewis
is a good man , I will fend mefleng;rs to
hfm and remonstrate to him against the in
v jury he is doing me. I have not been uu.
grateful to him : I supplied him with grain
in the time of his Beceffitirs ; I repaid him
the money I borrowed fiom him even be
fore it came due, that he might be enabled
to prosecute his Iswfuit, and even furnilhed
him with carts to carry his grain, to tbe
offence of my neighbor John, who quarrel
led with me on that account, and even now
I have not entered into any agreetsertt with
John to his injuryâIf I must not qnly not
carry my grain to any mill but that of Lew- j
i?, but nut be allowed to buy a horse from, i
or make any other bargain with any x of my
neighbors but such as Lewis pleases, I am
indeed ia a worse Situation than before I en-
tered iuto the contest with John, and had
better never have engaged in thit lawsuit at
allâwhereupon George sent meflengers to
Lewis, to confer with him on these things
and to renew their friendlhip, but when tbey
came Lewis indeed permitted them to enter
bis house, scut turned his back upon them
and refufed to See them, neither would he
hear them, or speak to them at all, but de
clared publicly in their bearing that he
would order his servants to overturn every
cart they should meet with going either to
or from John's mil!, or in wh.ch any mea
should he feunii which-had been ground at
John'd mill let it belorg to whom it might
âOn hearing this account' George saw t hat
he was in evil plight, and his tenants
very wroth, fcowevet" he deliberated wit i
himfclf calmly, and Taid, if I go to law
with Lewis, the expenses will he great and
my tenants may be very much injured betcre
a determination,can be had, though ju ice
would undoubtedly be in my favor ; 1 will
not go to law with him hastily, he is m ;
friend, he has been injured by John and is
irritated, a little time may alter his ienti
roents, I will permit my servants to defend
themselves, and to prevent his servants from
overturning ray carts, but I will not go to
law with him immediately ; when his pai
fion is abated and he has time to recolledt
hlmfelP, ttvln fKen argue with him calmly,
-and I am confident he will hear to reason
By this prudent determination a lawfiut
with all its concomitant evils was avoidsdâ
After some time the paflion of Lewis fubli
ded, he reasoned calmly and determined
wifelyâHe said with himfelf, I have been
too hady and betrayed too much passion in
my treatment of George, he hath fheun
more prudenee than I have done, I ha\e
injured him and will make him repaiation.^
If any of my friends feel .themselves ir.
a similar situation with George, I have told
this dory for their eonfideration, let them
profit by his example. SENEX.

The PURSE STRINGS /âNo, IV,
Or ttn EXAMINATION of the Idle ALARMING attempt
ioCoNGSESS, 1 ta CONCENTRATI J
Housi o/REPmsisrAi.v s.
FEiLoir citizens!
I Endeavoured to convince the public
in my Inft, by a great variety of argument
that the right to. carry on our lotercourfe
with foreign nations was vested in the Pre
sident, and T-conceive that none but difer
ganirers and-jacobins will refufe their aflent
to myi fec(W4 prtfpofitios, " That the
Hotif: of ReprefentutiQci has no r/ght tq in
terfere with, direst, manage or cheek this
jpower of the President ncr to examine in
to the expediency of its exercise,(except for
the putpofe of Impeichmen .)
The possession of a right necefTanly implies
the exclufionof inteffering rights or claims.
The delegation of a power absolutely, and
witHout any limitatioji, more especially a
-power which requires discretion, involves
in ir an unccntrouled right to jfxercife it.
Thus, the three gseat branches Â®f our go
vernment, have each of them refpeftirely
certain absolute powers, and neither of the
others Has aright tocontrol or interfere with
them.. The judges of the Supreme Court
have a 6 much right to enafl a law, as the
Legislature to make ajudicial decision ;
and the executive might as jtiftifiably lay
and levy a revenue without the consent of
the Legislature, a3 the latter can inter
pose between the President and foreign na
tions. Artful encroachments on any of the po
wers exclofively verted in any particular
branches of the government, are more daa-i.
gerous than open inroadsâThey are at firft
small, and pass unohferved ; they then ac
quire the authority of precedent, and array
themselves in the posture of rightsâOf
this nature are those conftruftions which
give to one branch the power to check and
control whatever they may deem the impro
per exercile of power in the other.
For illustration, SuppofeaPrefident, con
ceiving thatatax was oppreflive in its opera
tion, should recommend to the Legislature
to suspend it; that they fliould refufe , and
that he should afiume the power to direst
the officers not to colledt it ? What would
be the language of jacobin eloquence upon
such an encroachment ? Would' not every
"patriotic" throat be stretched to its loudest
tone, and every seditious firebrand be ful
minated against the tyrant who had been
guilty of the outrage ? And is this a more
decided, daring or direst violation of the
constitution, than the late inquiry in the
House of Representatives, itito the necefiity
the propriety, & even thehonefty ofthe execu
tive appointments ? But the 'patriots' will an
swer, that the Hyufe dpee not claim the
power to recall, or even leflen the number
of diplomatic agSits. and that the cases
put by me are not therefore analogous. It
is true â1< plead guiltyâthey only claim
the privilege ofJlarving them.
This idea naturally leads me to the con
sideration of my third propafitiou, which
is, that the povver to appropriate money
does not imply or include the right to in
fringe any exiftiÃg engagements made in
pursuance of Handing laws.
Appropriation, either in ftrift or liberal
conftrudtion, Signifies only the power to
designate the particular funds OHt of which
a debt of the government (hall be dischar
ged.
This is the cUar and obvious meaning of
the constitution when it provides that no
money (hall be drawn Irom the Treasury un
less by appropriations made by lawâand
such has heretofore been the coaftru&ion ol
Congress iu making all appropriation afts,
which have been Simple defgnations of tht
funds, out of which existing debts of the
government were to be paid. It is no mon
than the order of a merchant to his bankei
directing what particular money he should
apply discharge of a particular en
gagement. In'this afi the merchant has nt
choice 3S to the payment ofthe debt, hisc
leflion and discretion determined when hi
made the contract, and in like manner thi
discretion of Congress is exercised whei
they fix the salary or make an engagemen
with an individual, but the moment fuel
grant has pafied, all discretion is at an end
I he power to refufe to appropriate mon
ey for the payment ofambaffadorsâjudges
surveyors, or other officers, whose falaric
are fixed by law, ij no greater than the pow
er of a President or chief Justice to refufe t
do their duty ; nor is the rcfufal more ju:
than the demand Â»f the highwayman ol
that wealth of which he thinks lie can raaif
a better use than the traveller whom heplun-
It is in short, a violation of the constitu
tion, under the pretence, of discretion. t
is a pretext which has covered tyranny in all
ages and which will continue to Support it
so long as it is admitted. n - ,
The fourth and fifth propositions ftatert

ther the ihrccbrancles have no power to pals
a law, or else each of them is bound by it
after it has paf"ed. Jocolm metaphylicks

and yet not binding ; that a law m obligato
ry and yet may be violated at
that a mil may be and yet can be ar
retted, turned ouj! of cfs?e, banifted or
guillotined without trial or criminality.-
But New-England common finfe will exercise
the right to doubt these political bulls

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
MONDAY âMARCH 23.
The House being in a Committee of the
Whole on the bill providing the means of
Intcrcourfe with Foreign Nations, and
Mr. Nicholas's amendment being under
consideration :
Mr. Reed fpokf as follows :
The fuhjett before the committee } be
lieve is perhaps generally considered as near
ly or quite cxhaufted. Nothing very new
or important is further expefted : however,
resolving, so far as is poflible, to avoid re
peating those arguments and obfetvatrons,
which hare already, in the ("pinion of some,
been too often repeated, I feel disposed to
ipake'a few remarks.
The objedt of the amendment under cor
fideration, as I understand it, is to control,
or restrain the operations of the Executive
Department, with refpeft to ministers ap
pointed to officiate at foreign courts : and,
this restraint of executive power, is to be
effedted by reducing-the sum, or by appro
priating a less sum than hath been heretofore,
appropriated for that purpose.
The gentleman who brought forward this
amendment, and they who have joined with
him in the support of it, do not pretend to
accuse the President of having violated his
conttilutional trust, nor have they adduced
any proof to (hew that the charaJier of per
sons appointed to the office of ambassadors
is fueh, or the number so great, as really to
endanger the constitution, or the rights an\i
liberties of our county. The pretence is,
a fear, or apprehension of abuse in future ;
which in my estimation, is very far from be
ing a reason, fufficient to jwftify the mea
sure in contemplation. Certainly the Pre
sident is exclusively authorized by the con
ilitutionto nominate consuls and ambaflador#
gild flnj.oonlisnt flf the Cfcn
ate, hasan excliifive power to appoint them.
What reason have we to think that this du
ty has not been, or will not be discharged
faithfully and properly ? What reason have
we to imagine, that if the fuperintendency
and direction of this business, were taken
into our hands, it would then be tranfadted
with more fidelity, with more propriety and
fafety to our conftituerits ? Have we more
information upon this fubjeft ; are we more
capable of judging rightly with refpedl to
the number, the chara&er and grade of fo
reign ministers ? Or is there a greater degree
of responsibility and-integrity attached to
our ftatisn, than to the executive depart
ment ? These things will not be pretended.
1 am ready to acknowledge myfelf deficient
in point of foitable information upon this
fubjedt ; neverthelefis, it does appear to mÂ«
reafanable to suppose, considering the pre
sent peculiar (late of Europe, our relations
and connexions with the European nations,
that the number of ambafladors employed
abroad, is not too large, nor their grade toe
high, to manage well the difficult and inter
esting affairs of our national intercourse.
Responsibility is evidently a very import
ant and distinguishing chara&eriftic in i
representative government: and, it nauft b<
obvious to eveVy one, that the President ol
the United States, in this refpeft, is placet
in a different situation from the House o:
Representatives. It is perhaps a difficul:
thing, to render so numerous a body, as th<
House of Representatives, fufficiently res
ponfible. If a majority or less number o
individuals, fhanld at any time be guilty o
improper conduft, in their legislative capa
city, the blame might be divided amonj
themselves, or psffibly be fhifted from them
selves, to other members ; so that the peopl
at large, eould not easily ascertain, whoth
persons really blameable were. Befidei
members who belong to the House of Re
prefentatives, are chosen by diftritts, or b
theJlate they represent.
The circle which they more immediate!
represent, a-nd to which they are more pai
' ticularly refponfibie, i 3 comparatively small
whereas the President, is chosen by the L
â  nited States.âHe represents the whole unio
and to the whole union he is accountabi
and responsible. His responsibility, to Go
and men', is of the molt Serious and folcm
1 nature. His obligations to the fiiithful an
â  ! proper discharge of duty, are the greatefl
â  and motives the strongest conceivable ; ant
: 1 for my own part, I am unwilling to dim
1 ' nifh that responsibility, which is in foiT
t feiife our national security and Safeguard, fc
1 coatrolling or reftrairiing a power, which
â  am not suspicious has ever been abused.
I am sensible it has been insinuated thi
i our political intercourse is too extensive.-
s That this intercourse always has, and evi
- will prove difadvantageou9 ; but, perha]
0 these suggestions are without fufficient sou:
1 dation, We might have bees fubjedted i
much greater evils, without, and for the m
want of this intercourse with foreign nati- ur
ons, than we have fufiered in consequence cc
of it. ... r
Political as well as commercial intercourie cc
with .other nations, may possibly be carried pi
to fttch excess as to operate disadvantageous- m
ly : and, wbeimot carried to excess, it may
be the means-os violating and of inspiring er
some individuals and perhaps some particu- in
lar places, but the community at large, 1 t!
apprehend will be benefited. di
' All nations have their improvements and v<
virtues, as well as imperfections and vices ; bi
a suitable .degree of mutual intercourse, e:
would, theiefore, be in all probability, of ti
mutual advantage. In tills as a p<
nation, may be mere refpedtable tl
abroad : And, I am pervaded, that the ia
more our foreign ministers ; and also, the b
more ttrrpebple of this country in general, w
fee and know of other nationsâof their p
manners and customsâos the nature and o
perations of their governments, the mtg-e p
highly they will, eventually esteem and ad- tl
mire their own. ei
In America, free representative govern- rr
ment exists ; and, we hope, their existence n
will be perpetual. ' t;
Tins extensive continent, placed at so si
great a from other contineifts, and ai
discovered iu so late a period of time, is fa- b
vourable to the csufe of liberty ; it has pro- o
ved an asylum for the and perse
cuted of other nations : And, from our if
political as well as commercial intercourse w
with other nations and governments, fhey, it
as well as we, may be essentially improved
and benefited. Â©
Gentlemen in favour of the amendment, p
now before the committee, have urged its b
importance, aud the neceflity of its being a- o
dopted at this time, in order to check, as e
they pretend, a veiy dangerous patronage, t
arising from the exercise of executiveofpow- v
er, in appointing foreign agents and ambaf- fl
fadors. To me, the suspicion appears to- h
tally unfounded** '-I can discover 110 alarm"' b
iiig pivÂ£peift eÂ£ thfs kind. Corrnption is
not congenial to our government ânor is it e
requisite.to support and render popular any p
part of its adrriniftratiÂ«n. Our (late govern- r
menUprecludethe neceflity of many appoint- j
ments ; offices are, comparatively, but few,
and none of them very lucrative. No perfoo, a
in or out of office, can reasonably expert r
to secure any real and lasting popularity, by i
corrupting others, or by being himfelf cor- I
rupted. _
If our government had been founded in t
usurpation. and upon arbitrary and oppres- i
five principles, then it might have needed a
variety of vicious measures for its establish- -
ment. Then we might expeft that the ad- i
miniflrators would addrofs themselves to the <
paflions âto the avarice and the ambition 1
of its fubjetls. â¢ Then every species of ar
tifice and intrigueâpolitical and religious
tests, with hereditary and exclusive privile
ges might be neceflarv for the support of ad- :
ministration.
But the Constitution and government of i
the United States, need none of these means 1
for its fuppcrt. Formed by a free and en-
IglittMA, pcupU-T wyim !â Â»*"lTofateâtoans ot ~
equal rights snd privileges, it can only be
supported by just and equitable lftws, fairly
and impartially executed.-âThe President,
in his appointments, cannot be supposed
under the influence of favouritifm. Every
motive will induce him to have a proper re
gard, not only to abilities and information
; but also, to real and substantial merit, and
; integrity of character. I apprehend vis
â  have no reason to doubt, but that such
men will be appointed by the Executive, to
. the fevera! offices, as in their honed judg
: ment are bed qualified and disposed, to dif
i charge the refpeftive duties, with the grea
. left propriety, and most general acceptance
, to the people.
: Under these, arid similar impressions, the
i objeft of the amendment, appears to me,
; not only unnecessary, but improper, and
accordingly contrary to the intention and
j spirit of the Constitution: We find no vie
, lation of constitutional trust, in the execu
l tiveâno flagrant abuse ef power is pretend
> edâno inftaoce of improper conduft, which
. can, in the least degree jultify the meagre
in contemplation. 4
The method, which gentlemen, who ad
i vocate the amenement, propose, for reftrain
e ing the exercise of executive power, is by
f ! reducing the sum heretofore appropriated
I ! for the support of foreign miniller6.âln
f ! coufidermg this propopofition, a conflitu
t tionaltjueftionhas been broight into viewâ
e different opinions have been advanced and
- these opinions have been variously exprtffed.
f I feel therefore disposed to express my
f own opining also, and in my own way on i
- this occasion, with refpeft to the doArlne
t of appropriations.
i- The Constitution fays, no appropriation
e of money shall be made but by law. An
e appropriation is a law, or aA'of the Legi
!, j llature, appropriating a fmn of money for
:- ! some particular purpbfe. A legiflafive
y ] adt, is in its nature, voluntary and delibe
rate : Every member of the Legislature
y possesses the right of deliberating and deci
r- ding for himfelf.
; It is acknowledged by all that the legif-
T- lature has, what is termed thepbyjical
m er of making or of refufing to make <?ppro
le priations ; but in certain cases, and in the
d present cafe, some pr'etend this houle has
in not the moMir;power or to ap
id propriate a- le&ufurt been hereto
t, fore appropriated for the like
d, by moralpaiuer t is here meant, the right of
ii- doing a wrong and improper aftion, eer
ie tainly no individual, or body of men, can
>y possess this right, in any cafe whatsoever.
I There is no dispute here, and for niyfilf, I
believe it would be wrong and highly impro
at per and inexpedient to reduce the sum pre
- posed to be appropriated, according to the
er objedt of the amendment. But, if by mo
ps ral power be meant, the right of judging
n- when, and how the pewerougbt to
to be exereifed (and I think this must be the
meaning, if it means aur tbji'tr) ll.iV rir&i
undoubtedly belbngs to the legiflat-jv t. The
conftitun'on has no where: said th#jl eirinatatre
rti3ll not exercise this power ; nor hat the
constitution faid_the right of exetcifing this
power /fail be veiled in any other depari
ment of the government.
In this view of the fubjeft, I do consid
er the Conllitutional power of appropriat
ing money, as a sacred trull, committed by
the people of the United States, to the
discretion of the legislative branch of go
vernment.âThis power, or trull, is not to
be wantonly abused and trifled with, hut
exercised according to the principles of jus.
tice and good faithâof found wifdem and
policy. In the exercfle of this power,
there will sometimes be a difference of opin
ion among the members of the legislature â¢
but it is to be presumed, that a majority
will decide rightly, and legislate with' pro.t
priety.
I am sensible it maybe objedled, that this
power might be so exercifod as to fruflrate
the mod important executive meafnres, and
even Hop the wheels of government ;'it
may also be said, that if the senate should
refufe to concur with the house of reprefen
tatire, or the house of reprefentativei
fufe to concur with the senate, in making
and repealing laws, then there would
be an end of legiflatioti, and the wheels
of government be entirely flopped.
The fame unhappy effefts would ensue,
if the executive department should interfere
with the legislative, or refufe to discharge
its particular duties.
But these evils are not predicated upon a
conflitutional exiltence of powerâihey are
predicated upon a prefnppofed pjflible a
buse of powtr. Such abuses I conceive
ought not to be thus' anticipated. If they
ever Ihould arrive, then will be the proper
time to correft them j and, in the mean
while, each branch of the government
should lay alide unre&fonable jealousies, and
have a suitable confidence in all tha other
branches.
Each department of the government is
equally important, and equally dear to the
people of the United States ; and, their
â  mutual co-operations are necessary to the '
public welfare.
, The President and members of congress
, are all chosen by the peopleâThe govern
ment is theirs, and in their hands, as clay
is in the hands of the potter, and we mull
hope and expeft that they will moiMd and
falhion both the legislation arid adminillra
i tion, according to the true import and mean
ing of that mofl exeellent conflitution,
l which they have framed and adopted by mu
. - jal consent, and for mutual benefit, arid
which they flill admire and revene, as the
: only furc palladium of their dtareft rights,
1 liberties and privileges.
s Tuesday âmarch 27.
After some private business, which fhill
- appear in a future paper,
The house took up the unfinilhed bufi
f ness of yelterday, relative to the appropria
s tions for the military establishment ; and
. Mr. Gallatin's m#tion for ftrikimr out
F 200,000 dollars, tor the purpose ofinfert

r ter mailer's department, coming under con
, lideration, after some observations on the
I fubjefl, the sum was agreed to "be left in
y blank.
The refutations were referred to the com-
II mittee of ways and meaas to bring in a bill
i accordingly.
c Mr. Sewall moved for the order of the
h d;iy on the bill from the Senate to authorize
o the President to porchafe one or more foun
- dries.
Mr. Baldwin hoped the house would now
- resolve itfelf into a committee of the whole
e on the Hate of the. union.
After a few okferva'ions from Mr. Sevva'l
e agajnll, and from Mr. Nicholas in favour
of going into the business of the union, the
d house resolved itfelf into a committee of the
d whole on that fubjefl, Mr. Dent in the
chair ; when the PrefideHt' , s message of the
1- 19th inflant having been read,
1- Mr. Sprigg rose and observed, that every -
h fubjefit which came before the committee of
c the whole, on the ftafte of the union, mull
neceflarily be important ; but he-believed
1- there never was any more so than that which
). was prefentcd to them by the message of
y the President which had been read. Separ
d ated as we are from Europe by an immense
n ocean, it were to be wished that we were
1. equally separated from its political concerns
_ and that we fliould have to do with them no
d farther than what relates to commerce. â
|f. This unhappily, had not been the cafe, and
,y there now exilted painful differences betwixt
)n this country and the French Republic. The
, e meflage which had just been read was an e
vidence of this. In this fitn'ation of thirrgs,
)n it appeared necessary that the house should
n declare whether this country was to have
â¢j. prtce or war. This was a fubjedl in which
ur the bell interests of the union were deeply
concerned, and be hoped the business would
, e _ be met fully and fairly.âThe President had
re informed the houfc that the present slate of
-i- things is changed from what it was when he
prohibited the arming of merchant vtlTels,
[f. and that therefore he? had withdrawn that
v . prohibition. Whether the order formerly

NEW-YORKTMarch H- '
Thomas Paine has written a letter to vin
dicate the Directory forbanilhing Pichegru
and his companions on the 4th of Septem
ber lad ; a measure which he acknowledges
to have been a violation of the conditution, J
and to be judified only on the principle of '
" supreme necessity." t
No misfortune in life is more degrading i
than for a man's paflions to survive his pow- (
ers, and for his carcase to outlive his repu- 'â¢
tat ion. Paine has degenerated in his ability j !
to write,, as much as his repntation has been ! '
impaired by his principles, and his health, ; <
by his vices. His writings exhibit but the | t
, ficalcton of an author, and ferveonly to snow e
that the man once exided.
He sets out with affirming of the French
â government, " That a better organized con- '
lh'tution has never been deviled by human ; 1
'wif&om," and " that it is free from all the 1 *
Hrices and defers to which other forms of
government are more or less fubjeft." j r
He aflerts as a position which is not to be ' }
denied, that each of the parts of a govern-j .
xr.ent should be in perpetual maturity, and ; '
that we diould laueh at the idea of a nati- j C
onal council compoftd of children, or idiots, ; 1
of deaf, dumb, blind or insane persons. | f
Yet this is often the cafe of an hereditary
executive called a king. r .
Of all this pperile duff, Tom PainÂ« is
welcome to the credit. The ideas are like
a thousand others very proper to amuse chil.
dren and hackneyed sots. In all hereditary
governments provision is made for a
rary defect in the powers of the executive; a
yWid a nation is usually as well governed and c
as happy under Â» regency, as under a king A
of full age. And we venture to assert that 0
in very few of the monarchies of Europe 1
have the people had occasion to weep over v
the infirmities of their executive, so often
as thii miserable opprefled inhabitants of F
France, over the turbulence, the paflions,
caprices and vices of their executive. t<
Theories are idle thingsâand Tom Paine
will never make men believe themselves more a
happy under the executive of jive, who ar- 11
red,banifh and confifcate pe-rfons at pleasure;
than they are in a monarchy, where no man v
can fuffer the loss of life, liberty or proper- a
ty, but in pursuance of fixed laws. I
In deciding the quedion whether execu
tive power is bed lodged-in an individual or
a plurality, he fays, "an individual willnne w
ver be any thing more than the chief of a 0
party, and none but those of that party will c
have access to him. -â  , ~n
Admitting this in its fidl extent, what is
the preference of an individual who in the
chief of a party, or a majority of five, who
are chiefs of a party ? It is not in unity of
number, but in unity of principle and views,
that party confids ; and this unity will 'be !c
formed as certainly it) a dire&ory o( Jh>e,
as in an individual ; nay, it would be as '
certainly formed, only with more intrigue t .
and corruption, in an executive of jive hun- â
dred. In the name of common sense. let
Tom Paine fay, what is the difference in
principle, whether an individual leads a par- ; t
ty, or whether Barras, lieubel and Lepaux Iv
lead a party ; and fend their colleagues, and si
all who are not of their party, to South- t<
America, without law and by a sovereign g
aft of party ?
For shame, Paine. Cease to peder the p
â¢world, and especially the intelligent Ameri- n
cans, with fiuh sou ferric. ci
The writer goes on to fay, that three men
in the executive are too few tor the variety
and quantity of bafinefs and that Jive is the tl
right number. And will the reader believe tl
tbit this celebrated man, has let himfelf d
down so very low, as to judify the .choice
as Jive, as the number of the Direftory,
from the analogy of nature, in giving to t] -
the human m dy Jive fenfet, Jive Jingen and jj
Jive t'jes !! ! This is certainly going beyond w
Lord Ccke, in vindicating the number
Twelve ina jury, from the fame number of
apostles and of signs in the zodiac ; and in w
ptoving that edates never ought to ascend
to the ancedors, but always to defeend, be
cause, beeaufe the bodies defeend in the na-
tural world by the power of gravitation.â r j
We should have supposed that in the" age of
reason," even Paine would have been asham
ed of fueh puerilities! !
We (hall notice only one other paragraph
in this fix-penny publication, which is, that
which chargesPichegnj,Barthelemyfc Party, t
with defeating the negociations for peace. â¢ "
This is (uch an abominable falfehood, that
no honed man can overlook it. v
It is a thing known to all the world, that !
the proscribed party were the advocates for ] P'
peace, and urged the accomplishment of it 01
byall the meansintheirpoweft Nay, they ur- i
gedforpeaceon thebafis of judice,that of ad- j
heringto thepreliminariesfignedatLeoben in 1

durable. It is a known fadt, that Barthele- E '

liminaries, to preserve the integrity of the
German empire, arid wished a peace an that w
principle. On the other hand, the jacobin

With the emperor on those terms on which m

COMMUNIC/ITIQH.
When the late message of the President
was fird communicated, it was amusing to
remark the affected budle and rtfentmant of
e certain party, at the fsppreffion of the dis
patches. They pretended to hunger and
third after information, thinking that the
want of it would furnifh a fufficient excuse
for opposition to all defenfive measures, and
they announced their intention of demand
ing the papers from the Executive, presu
ming he would persist to withhold them.
But how hasthuclamour fnbfided since they
have discovered that no opposition is con
templated to their making a requed for these
paper*. Do thty fufpttt that the applica

Extract from a Journal publilhed in Germa
ny, refpeftitig the ever memorable revo
lution of the 4th September. The c
vents of it are there brought into one
view, and will teach every American more
and more to prize his country and gov

" From one revolution to another, consti
tutions to coftftitutions, new laws to new
laws France is arrived at a government
which disregards them all ; which, after
havitig secured the generals by corruption,
the army by its generals, and the Councils
by the army, reigns by force under some va
riable forms of liberty. The people, worn
out with long and afflicting agitations, ap
pear decided to let the powers, which they
havecreated or appeared to create, di'pute
among themselves the right of opprelfing.
The calm, which succeeded the revolution
of 18 Fru&idor, proves it ; the consequen
ces of that memorable day havÂ« been such
es we might expeft from the debasement of
the Representatives, the despotism of the
Direftors, the lafFitude of the people, and
the apathy of honest men.
Revolutionary Justice, it is true, has fa
crificed the life of one person ; but this aft
was the more junjuft and barbarous, as the
Direftors were certain without it of the sub
mission or flight of the unfortunate vi*timt
of their vengeance. The crouds of emi
grants, who had returned to Paris, seduced
by hope or by want, is diflipated al
most ina moment ; expelled from their coun
try a second ttme, they aIR an<lTeelt fn dlf
tant regions compaflion and an asylum.
Some feeble aflembliesof men inthefouth
of France were dispersed as soon as formed
âonly one town, Montauban, openly refill
ed for a month ; the Dire&ory ordered foma
troops thither, and the townfubraitted with
out linking a blow. Thus evaporated the
effervefcence of the South, of which so
much ha! been said ; this is all that the re
sentment of the departments insulted in the
persons of their deputies has produced !
Their eledtions have been vacatedâthe/r
representatives driven from the Councils ;
they are deprived of their (hare in the ma
king of the laws which th'e constitution pro
mised them ; yet not only do they fuffer
themselves to be governed without murmur
ing, but addresses of congratulation, that
partake of cowardice and guilt, are every
day pre'fented to a mutilated degraded le
gillature. I
Of the proscribed representatives, but
one, Camille Juurdan, has dared to address
his constituents uponjthe tyranny of the Di
redior)- j and his protections meet with,
derifioti from the oppreftors, and indiffer
ence from the oppressed. Those of his col
leagues who have not had the fortune like
him to escape the proscription,âthose men
who were little less than the Gods of the
dayâthe Pichegrus, the Villot3, the Bar
thelemis. are ignominioufly conduced thro
a hundred leagues of country and through
populous towns, and not one attempt is made
to deliver them. They are embarked with
piecipitation for the most savage countries.
Those men, who two months fmce were ca
ressed and enthroned in the opinion of their
countrymen, who are every day more and
more convinced of thefalfity of the folilary
charge allcdged against one of them, are
forgotten 1
But Hoclie, whe flood condemned by
the public voice for having promoted with
equal baseness and insolence the designs of
the Diredtory against the Representatives
of the nation, dies ; and although neither in
the field of honour, nor in consequence of
wounds, as so many genjerals of the Repub
lic have done whose tombs are-unkown, the
Direflory and Councils decree funeral hon
outs such as none of the great men of the
revolution had as yet received; and the Par
ifians, who are arrtufe3 or occupied with
this new pomp, leave the Cbamp-de-Mais
filled with admiration of the hero of the fefÂ»
tival !
The Direftory were not ignorant of the
effeft producedby those displays ef tranfito
ty glory upon susceptible minds, of the re
sources which feftivity in general afford the
masters ox a multitude pafiionately found of
Theatres and (hows : therefore they lose
no occasion of establishing new ones. The
camplaifnt oratuis of were
eager to propose to the Councils a fete in
honour of the day of their victory, and af
ter many fittings spent in idle difcuflion an
annual one was decreed to celebrate* its
triumph.
j What have not the Councils dtme a
; month past to second the views, and itcreafe
, the power of the l)ireÂ£h.ry ! The law upari
i the organization of its guard was inconve
| nient, and it was modified ; that upon
i the nat!onal guards displeased, and a revi
sion was ordered. The Council had depri
ved it of the right of opening the lettcrsof
foreigners, they have reftorcd it ! They
extended itspowerof nominating to places
vacant in the departmental administrations
-The Direftorywere indignant, at notbe
' ing able to eflablifh their power, or cha
stise the bravecolonifts for their refinance
in the I fie of Fiance, and to revenge
the fending away of the Commiflioners ;
not less so when the Councils required to
know what recompense had been made to
vice-admiral Sercy ; whose punifliraent they
now demand, and measures adapted to fab
jeft, or rather to ruin that colony. Finally,
the Direftory being offended, more than
injured, by the law, which the councils two
months previous having passed refpefting
the motions of the troop* deemed necessary
for their security, they are now in haste to
revoke.
It was necessary a!fo to flatter and reward
the army, which had so well seconded the
Direftory ; hence the veil drawn before ma
ny crimes ; hence the new modes prescribed
by military trials.
All the proceedings of the legislative body
are in dire it oJ.-JNjfition to those previous lo the
iSih Frudtidor. The wifeli nu.rihets of the
council of ancients had comhatted a laterefolu
tio.i of the council of five hundred refpeislin&r
divorces as being infirftieient to ae'refl the dre'a 1
ful confeqj. nces of the Jaws heretofore made
refpecUng tl em ; hut fcjrce had the ancients
been purified by the late ordeal of the direflo
ry, than the fame rffolution was approved.
A htimaneNw had recalled iâ¢ ito ths unfortu

like those recent'/ made to the council of five
hundred against the nobles.
The law which reimburses in new paper, or
to speak more corrc&ly, which finks two thirds
of the public debt This law Jiad been already
decided on in the council of aw tents, when
many am rig them opposed it as vnjuft, uncon-
Ritutional and impolitic; when R.iuiTeau had
the courage to fay that the Â« ft abftlute despot
could scarce believefuch an idea, that it was a
plan illy disguised of the molt Jhameful bank
ruptcy, that it tended to ruin 301/100 families,
in a word that it was worthy only to figure by
preeminence in the code qf a Gtngis-Kban. In
fa<9, it was so viewed even by thole who propo
sed the law, Â»hen theyjuftified it by necejity to
which recfon must yield j when they coalidered
the sums due by the state to its creditors as of
merely a variable imaginary value, when they
called fa many solemn guarantees given to the
unfortunate creditors indijereet promifet. Thus
neither truth nor arguments could prevent the
ancients from famÂ£lioning the bankruptcy pro
pped by the five hundred : thus those creditors
who. were warmly attached to che revolutionists
as soon as they had declared the public debt to
be under the " loyalty" of the nation, have fa
tattyfcarnt what *Â« loyalty" means in the revo
lutionary flyle; and that no means are too de
testable to be nfed to strip them of their proper
ty and lives.

INTO TJIE
or ran of epidemic diseases,
r FHE Letters to Dr. Curria, which I pui,lifted
X bft autumn, led me to an mve'ligation of
the origin and phenomena of peflilKn-ial diseases
in other countries, as well a# in the United St tes,
In the prof.cutioi. of the fubjed, new fajSs and
principles continually opened to my v|.*w. r n d fi
nally determined me to trace tack the hiilpry of
such diseases as far as the records of hiflory ex
tend. For this purpose, I have examined the pub.
lie libraries in Ntw-York, Cam-
Boflon, with a view to obtain'a 1 tho
material fails which can illustrate the fubjael.and
' l>ave nearly colledled all the materials for the
propof*cl Wor]Â£.
The laaseajl fled will enable me to demon.
Urate that many of the common
pefti'.eotial epidemics, are unfounded or extreme
ly iticorreil ; and this in'cotif quence of i.-.edical
writer* confideringan epidemic disease asad.tach.
Ed or isolated phenomenon in a particular coun*
try ; rather than as conneaed witK other < -ide
j-ics or other phenomena of naturf in various
parts of the world. The fads J have colleifted
lead to certain deductions which are furprifingto
myfelf, and whic*h will probably be new to many
others. Much light will be thrown on titiw dark
Â«d p rplexing fu'jjca, as well as op pl>U
ophy.
The proposed work will make a full filed o&t),
ve volume j and executed well on fine paper, caa,
not be afforded at lels than two dollar', bound,
with the usual allowance-to book-fellers. AÂ« th*
compilation will cod not only great labor.but con
fidsrable expcnce, no more copies wil) be printed
than to supply fubferibers. Tha book will be rea.
dy for fubferiber? early ii: the coming fumraer, an<{
