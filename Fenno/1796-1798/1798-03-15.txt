By accounts from Bern, of the Â»!th Decem
ber, it appears that the greatest unanimity pre
vailed in the councils of that state ; that all
political disputes were so entirely laid aside, that
the firft deputy appointed to the diet had been
supported, and tven nominated by the very
party whose measures he had hitherto uniform
ly oppofad.
The fame spirit continued to animate the
. troops as well at the inhabitants at large ; those
of the Pays deVaud in particular had given the
I raoft unqueftioriable proofs of their affeftien and
fidelity to the government.
The French generals, alarmed at the milita
ry appearance and t enthufufm of the troops of
thecariton of Bern, apprehenfivc also of a gene
ral infurreflion in the protectant part of the
bifhpric ofÃafle, had withdrawn their forces
from the territory of BienNe, and from the
whole of the plain country, and had retired in
to the Jura.
The inhabitants of Bienne had displaced the
municipal officers chosen Uy the French, aad
had called on the neighbouring cantons to gua
rantee their ancient rights and privileges.
The cartont of Zurich, Soleure, and Fri
bourg, had warmly approved the condtnS of the
, government of Bern ; and there fctsni every
reason to believe that, with the exception of
Basle, all the other ftatet will ail ia ptrfeA con
cert with the leading Canton
A disavowal of any hostile intention, and some
aukward explanations of the eircumftancet ac
companying the invasion, had been give* by Mr.
Bacher, and it may be collefled from the lan
guage of some of the French journalt, and the
total ftlence of others which were lately loud on
â¢he f'ufajVdt, that the directory has experienced
a severe disappointment oa this occasion, and
that it it now persuaded that its friends in
Switzerland had given very falfe accounts both
of their own strength, and of the temper and
fpn it of the government ind the inhabitanti.
In the mean time, Switzerland continue* to
bi inundated with French libelt; the dififtcÂ£l
ed fubjedls, who have quitted their refpeilive
cantons, are invited to civic fcfls in the house
of the new Fiench minister at Basle ; and the
whole attention of the French government feemt
now to be direfled to the separating some
one or more of, the cantom from the con
federacy. In this attempt it it generally believ
ed that the French will succeed only with the
canton Â»f Basle. Since the French have obtain
ed poflellion of the Pcrentrui, and the country
ca.led the Frichthal (which the Aullrian* ap
pear to have ceded by fame secret article of the
treaty of Carapo Formio J, this small canton it
left entirely at the mercy of the French.
We jre happy in having an opportunfty to
lay before our readers the note that Mr. Wick
ham delivered to the Helvetic body on hit recall.
In the language and cor.dufl which the British
iwnifter was direiSled to hold upon this occa
tion, the world will fee a new proof of the ex
treme moderation by which his raijefty's con

So in this country, men, hearing of this
e fa<3, inquire "why our atizens in Piris arc

tiee.
" The Marechalle de Biron, a very old
and infirm woman, was ia the Luxembourg
'Â» in Paris, where also her daughter in-law, the
duchess was also confined. A cart arriving
at the prison to convey a number of viftims
d to the Tribunal, the lid, in the coarse di-
Palest of republicanism, contained the name
1- of laftmme Biron. " But there are two of
them," said the keeper. Â«' Then bring
them both,', wa3 the reply. The aged ma
il rechalle, who was at supper, concluded her
1- meal while the red wefe preparing, then
took up her book of devotion and departed
It cheerfully. The next day both mother
c and daughter were guillotined."
This anecdote will answer answer all en

" The following 13 from an authentic

" Three men have been taken up lad

the jail in New-Brunfwn.k', who belonged
to the British frigate Hermione whose crew
seized the (hip, murdered the officers, and
delivered her up to the Spaaiards, in Sep

" They came to Amhoy in the brig Re

and their names art Williams Brigftock, a
native of New-York, Johannes Williamfon,
a swede, and Michael Campbell, an Eng
lishman. On examination before the magi
strate, they acknowledged, that they were
on board at the time of the mutiny, but
denied being concerned in tbe horrid afts
committed by a part of the crew. The firfl

The following article which appears to
corroborate the report of the capture of the
Spanifli fleet by :idmiral Orde, is copied
from the Sun, of Jan. 15.
Advices have been receivsd at the Admi

that two rich Spanish (hips had reached Ca
diz Harbour. They were part of a fleet
from South America, very richlv laden.â
His lordship was immediately to put to sea
to intetcept the remainder, and as the Spa

FROM A LATE LONDON PAPER
The following Angular and melancholy
event occurred at Bilfton, on Wsdnefday
fe'nnight A butcher had been employed
to kill a pig at a house at that place, and
after having hung it up he imprudently left
his knife behind him ; when a boy about
four years old, who had seen the pig killed,
took the knife, and ((hocking to relate)
Itabbed an infant under the ear, as it lay
asleep in a cradle : Alarmed at the blood
which flowed from the wound, he immedi
ately ran into the yard to his mother, who
was drawing water at a well ; the fight of
the bloody knife, and the boy's criÂ»s, so
terrified the poor woman, that'the windlass
flipped from her hand's, and ft ruck the boy
with such force on the head, that it killed
htm on the spot f ! The didrefs of the mo
ther, after losing two children in this dread
ful manner, may be better conceived than
described.â-
. T^ e Emperor Paul has revoked the pro
hibition upon the importation of Norwich
driped goods, and fettled the tariff upon a
footing the mod favorable to this country.
We are told by the jacobins, that the
military officers in the Britffh service are too
fluggiffi to set such an example to their sol
diers as may impel them to refid, with fuf
ficient ardor, the impetuous troops of France
slushed with conqued, and annimated by
their enthufiadic leaders. Jf the French
dare to land on our coad, we doubt not,
however, to fee the fleady valor of Eng.
lifhmen, employed in supporting the free
dom of their country, triumph over the
ruffian ferocity of miscreants, intent only
upon plunder.
By intelligence received'frem Bruflels, it
appears thai the United Departments con
tinue to enjoy the blessings in which they
have been permitted to participate ever since
the amalgamation of Belgium with the
French republic. That domiciliary villts,
for the purpose of discovering requi/ition m n
and deserters, are more frequent than ever ;
that many such perfnns have bren pn grcf
