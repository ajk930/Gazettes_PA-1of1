from the American Daily Advertiser. j
Mcfli'J, Claypoole,
On perilling your paper of Monday, under the
s;ad of New-York, dated July 22d, I read with
â¢hat emotion which every philanthropic mind mud
el, the unwarrantable arrest of tw# citizens o|
-lie United States, named Davis and Martin. The '
C.nife of their being imptefie 1 was, they had neither 1
c -'documents to prove they were Americans '
their persons, which had much the refemblancft, 3
of iTk'n-of-wars-men, betrayed the officer into an *
who took them out of the ship Chatham, at
If an attivedifpofition had.been fhewri
by the persons who ft* duty it was, to procure an r
oith r.ttefled before Mr. Johnflonthe American Con 1
â t in London, certifying the two n*.*n in question v
' Ie Americans, and delivered in before the Regu
luting captain at that port, befoi-e they were fcnt
oown to the Nore, it would have been ftriiUy at
tended to. 'In reply to the latter part of the charge 1
>peaking of the non-attention to the certificates of
citizenlfup, 1 beg to contradidl, as far as has rela-
ted to myfelf, having commanded (hips many years,
and within two years lad pad in particular. I have
never loft a feainan who had a certificate of his ci
tizenlhip about him, but have met the most polite
treatment from officers of men of var and press
gangs in general. The diabolical pra&ice of ta
king meninto afervice, contrary to their inclination, ca
cannot be defended, but a service once established 1,1
so extensive as the navy of Great-Britain, requires mi
unjiift means to obtain men fuflicient to a'ufwer
their purpose, for those flarioncd in the Weft or
Ealt-indies efpepally. Mr. Johnfton does grant to
certificates where the sailors have lfl
none from their own country ; but to prevent their
being impreOTed, they can obtain qne by applying 1 U
to him, and the fee I have always ttnderftood was
an emolument to the cletks for theii extra trouble
attendant on that dutyâand three weeks is long e- flt<
Jiough for tailors to be strolling in Wapping; they his
indeed generally contrive to part with their dollars in P r<
much Jess time, and after they have (hipped again tht
for their homeward paflage, the commander can col
and ought to fee his men protested, independant St:
of further expence, by a legal application to the A- wa
merivan Consul. Indeed, I accuse my brother ? rt "
commanders with negligence, for not feeing their
men in |<?:fefiion of certificates of citizenffiip, at the P m
time he pays them their month's advance, before
he fails from home. This 'would effe&ually keep tha
his crew togenheron an European voyage in parti- ancl
lar. My motive for noticing this ide'rtion of York P' ei
news, is no other than to declare truth and dete& " )a '
fallacy j for if opinions are formed by the seamen, ce "
that proteaions are useless, we fhsll find much dif- P ed
ficulty in procuring men to woik our fhipi, and untJ
those we may get at most extravagant wages. 1

Of the Kingdom of Sardinia.
(CONTINUED )
To complete the Duke's misfortunes, the city of
Geneva, the foveieignty of which 4ie claimed, feizui
thia opportunity to aifart axvd rwoW
produced also that of the neighboring territories. The
Genevans boldly asserted their independence noain.t
the duke ; and by the afliftance of the Swiss canton of Â® n S
Berne, were (inabled to defeat all his efforts. Taking m
advantage of his imbecillity, while overwhelmed by U
the armies of France, they also fcized all thecsftles and'
places of strength in the neighbourhood. The canton M
of Berne at the fame time conquered the Pais de Vaud.
The canton of Friburgh, too, although they had no r,
quarrel with .the duke, were unwilling to lose so favor
able an opportunity, and seized a considerable part of C
Charles's territory. Being still retained by the two P art '
cantons, these acquifitisns have become the most valu- hrigh
able part of their territory, and add considerably i 0 cloud
their power. t
The treachery of the marquis of Saluces was the
means oi restoring to Charles many towns in Pied
mout ; and this principality would have Seen re-cun- Â°Â° Nve
quered with the fame facility that is reqaifite to march E ai
through it, had not rhe governor of Fofiino detained
the Imperial army a month before that inconfidera'ole citize
place. Thui tiie treafoa of Saluces was checked. A peoph
truce for three mor.ihs ensued ; this stipulated that 'the so
each party fhoHld retain what they poflefTed. A truce w ;,h
for ten years followed, in 1535, by which Francis I t â¢
-wasfecured in poilefiinn of half the duke's dominions.
The Emperor itil) retained polTefiion of the other cities I
not ceded to the French, and the unfortunate duke 2 -
found himfelf fliut up in Nice, the only corner of 3.
which he kept pofTcfTion. He saw the reft divided be- I fence .
tween a powerful invader and the ally to whose protec
tion he had trullcd. I hus exhibiting a fad monument
of the imprudence of those who, by taking part in < .
the quarrel of mighty neighbors,.are frufhed and over
whelmed ifi the fliock. 7. '
In 1543, war having broken out afrefh, the duke of '
Savoy was befiegcd in Nite by the French, in conjunc- '"ay so]
tion with the Turkifli admiral BarbarolTa, who had and th
been joined by a French flett with a body of land fore- diffuf,-
es under the duke d'F.nguien. The town was gallant- â¢
Iy defended by Montfeit, a Savoyard gentleman, who
flood a general assault and rtpulfed the enemy, before
he retired into the caftie.. In that fort, situated on a '"Y '
rock, on which the enemy could make no impression, 11.
and H-hich could not be undermined, he held out i'o the frc
long that Doria had time to advance with his fltet. Up- 12
on intelligence of this, the siege was raised. .l
Shortly after this period Charles died. $y the trea
tv of Chateau Cat ihrtfis in 1559, the dutchy of Sa- , '3"
voy, principality of Piedmont, the country of BrefTc down u
and moll of the other territories were restored to his '4'
ion Philibert Emanuel, at that time commander of 15.

We hear from the confederation of Podolta, that tnol

Other hand is doing all in her power to mit. their Pea,

the parents of girls .who have arrived at the age of
ten years', to deposit their milage portion, in the
Imperial Treasury. She has like,vife tak-n upon
herfelf to choose hu(bmdÂ£ for them. It is to be

to rellrain the Poles, who will dread a fonfifcation
of a valuable part ef their property ;it is alio as 1
easy to forefec that she will choose none but ltuifi terr ,
an hufbmds, nndi'r the idea that children will anfe f.a<

ing to ihnt of their fathers. It mull be conceived, rC ve
that i ( that plan is put into execution, it will have Â£ ut
the effea which the court of Ruflia expieets, but its f
execution produ.es an extreme indignation. Never lolir
before hath any despot shown so effeÂ£tua!ly an utter tow
contempt for the feelings of. nature, and of Vl,) ' c {tor
rights which are held sacred among the -civilized and
nations of the woild, nor have men at any time lay

tkit.k i!,>.;ca.i ni.ke ule ot the Poles to work a g ra
diversion, they should profit, by the indignation (tat
which this new tyranny has ex .ited in that unhsp- eo n
py country. The king of Pruflia is busy in raising { eri
laTge bodies of cavalry in his new Polifti poflclTioii?. ct {\
He thus recruits his army with troops reputed ex- ; n f

shot here twodeferters from the Republican troops, {
who had bt<sn chiefs among the Chouans âthey sub- a
mitted to their fate with firmnefd. Some days be- j
fore, several folaiers of the main army, accused of
theft, rape and plunder, were condemned by- the (
irtilitary eummiHion, to two years imprisonment in
irons.
Jamin, thefon, returning to this place from Be- j
eltuel, was afijfliuated by the Chouans; his body j
was found in the highway, pierced with several
wounds, by (hot, and by the sabre. I tie cxclujivtt (
patriots, of our country, under the pretext that he |
,was a Ctiouan, rejoice at a misfortue which has (
