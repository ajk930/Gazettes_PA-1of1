been directed to makea report tocongrefsin March '

houle, but to the Senate only. He'fa'd the land .
in question was of gieat extent and value, and [
some measure ought to betaken on the fubieift. He j
therefore proposed that a meffaga ihould be sent to 1
the attorney-general for a copy ef that report. A

Mr. Malbone.faid he found it inconvenient to at- Â«

on the report of the committee of ways and means, \
on the fubie& of a land tax.
Mr. Henderfon. Mr. Chairman, lam very sensible
that our present revenue system is not fufficientlv pro- ?
dutpVe, toanfwer the exigsncies of government, and
that it isneceflary, during the present session, to adopt ''
forme measures to improve it. This,, I believe, will be si
admitted by all, and the only question is, as to the ti
mode by which it lhall be ac&mplilhed. a
iwo modes of obtaining an increase of revenue, are _
contemplated. Ihe one, by extending the present fy- ,
ft*m of muireA taxation, as far as prudence will ad
ir.RâThe other, by having recourse to direst taxation. t
llfon taking a comparative view of the two differ- Â«
ent modes, the advantages that appear to my mind, u
to arise ont of, and flow from tne firft, have so much
the preponde'rance, that 1 cannot give my aflent to the
adoption of the other,- until the improvement of the 1
IvAem of individual taxation has bcentairly tried, and
ihall prove infufficient to meet the necessary expendi- a
tures of government. * .' 'v * tl
Sir, I will take the liberty to enumerate Â» few of the Â«1
advantages lhat the present system poflefies, which can- h
not be attached to the new one. This fyftiin harbeen 1
organized, for a eonfiderable length of time, and the
citizens have got accuftcmed to, Â«ud are generally well
fittst.ad with it. It can be extended without any
â¢change in the- system, or perhaps the appointment of
one new officer. It will occasion the least possible ex-
â¢pcnce in thecolleaion. It is the molt easy aad agree- Â»
able mode of raising revenue from our citizens, in the tl
â¢power of government to adopt. They pay the tax a
vbiuntarilv and imperceptibly; they have an option,
to coniumc much, er little ; and in proportion to their r
eonfumption, will bc their contribution to the revfnue.
Sir, the revenue arising from this -fyliem, has been l '
8 state progreflion ever since the system was Ic
got into operation, and.l trust may be jireferved ia w
that state. It has, I believe, answered l '
sanguine expectation of its promoters, and I have Â£
very little doubt on my miud, but that iÂ» would have ff:
met all the common exigencies of govermtient, if
there had not, of late, atifen some very extraordina- 31
ry aad heavy greatly augmented ci
our public debt. b
Sir, with regard to the system of direst taxation, cl
almost every member who has advocated themea- el
sure, acknowledges that it will be attended with ?
coufiderable and I belfeva the opi- 11
nion to be well founded. Great innovations upon G
fyllems of taxation, are generally embariaffing. It r(
isto tu unexplored giound. The drawing of reve- u
cue, by coercion, trom our citizens, appear&to me "
one of ttit mo ft delicate and difficult fuljeas <jo- r '
vernment can engage in. Besides the danger*of u
ehcreafing the excitement of public mind, and 0
of alienating the affections of o*:r citizens from die ei
present government, 1 think that the difficulty of "
levying a land tax upon principles of equal juftics u
{a priiieiple that ought always to be kept {n view.) tc
W ..I be almost infuper bk. Thtsjfentiment was so ll
fully and ably difcufled by the metnber from South- f<
Carolina, who was-lafc up 00 the fubje&,jthat there Â§
is little room for any fur"her remarks upon it. 1 a '
will proceed t.i observe, thatthisXyftem wilLrequire 111

imoioperation short of a very heavy expenfc, and w
tijt earlielt probable time that it will afford aid to r 3
our revenue will be coflfi-krafcly icmote. With w
tÂ» the expenses of the fyilem, the feereiary w
of the treasury appears to have been, sensible that ul
the cidleition of taxes in this way would lie very â
expeuiive, as will appear by a ftatwnent m his re
port upon the system In that report, he appor
t'one the sum of .1,484,000 dollars to the fcveral

be as ! j to 3 3 4, or at mod to 4
C Sir, with regard to the txpenfes of collection, I
would nft, if any member would want a moment s
time to which is the preferable system ?
I apprehend net.
Sir, the gentleman from Pennfylvaoia, who wis
r firftupoa this lubjeiA, regretted exceedingly that a fy
' -stem of direst taxation hid not been adopted long lince
c by government. For myjÂ»art, I differ very much in
* .opinion from that-gentleman on this point, and-J can
f fay, that instead ot' regretting, I rejoice rtiit fucb a
1 system has not yet been adopted, aad have full confi
r dence that the measures of government will not be pa
ralysed, as that gentleman seems to ihiflk, if ' l fcoeld
be further postponed. That gentleman is eegaged in
the commercial line, I am in the agriealturli line,
which, perhaps, may account for our great difference
in opinion upon this point. Hawever confonmt it
may be to the feelings and interests of the commercial
| part of our-citizens, to have the revenue raised in this
, way, sure I am, that the gentleman, with all the force
of eloquence and reasoning that he is poffelTed of, w ill
never be able tÂ» convince the great body of the yeo
, manry of this country, that it will bÂ« snore for their\
interests to colleift the revenue at thÂ« expence of 15
per cent, than at the expence of 3 or 4 per cent.
Sir, it Appears that the geutleman from Pennsylva
nia has it in contemplation, tothiow the whole bur
then of government upon tbe farmer. If I rccolleÂ£l
right, his words were theseâ" The wealth of the
country rnuft have bccome so eonfiderable, from the
high price which eveiy agriculturalproduilioo had long
been at, as to enable them very well to fuppprt the ex
pences of government."âWith regard ta which, I
would obfewve that under the present system/ in my â¢-
piaion, the farmer generally bears an equitable pro
portion ef the expences of government, 't here may
be'fome few sxteptions, as it is impeffible that any re
venue Jyilenn can, be ettablilbed that W'H operate equal
ly in proportion to wealth upon every citiaen aad it
would he SljElyrajpolitiato ray tire whole burthen of
â¢the revenue upon anyone particular class or descrip
tion of citizens, but the surest policy, is to IÂ«t both a
gricuhural aad commercial bear their parts as they
now do.
The gentleman farther â¢bferved, " that if peace
was made between tbe nations a: war, he had po
doubt, but there would be a defalcation of she rev
enue," He offered no reason to support hiÂ« opin
ion, and as lam of different opinion, I will, in a
-few words offer the reasons why 1 think our reven
ue, instead of meeting with any ccnfiderable Chock
from that event, (so ardently to be wished for by
every humane mind, by every true American)
will be improved. Commerce depends chiefly up
on wealth and population. If peace fnould take
place, our wealth and population will pregrt fs very
tact. I think we n_ay reasonably calculate upon a
larger ratio of wealth and population emigrating
from all parts of Europe to America.' In propor
tion to the increase thereof will be the demand for,
and eonfumption of imported articles. Our com
merce will not only be continued with the old, but
be extended to uew markets, which will of course,
tncreafe the quantity of impoftj asd tonna|c, and
in proportion at they are increased, will cur reven
ues be augmented.
The gentleman observed that, with refpeft to
excise, he need not fay how unprodu&ive it had
been. Ihe article of fnuff, instead of producing
any thing, bad brought the revenue in debt j and
that the cxcife en another article;' hatjlalkd forth v
the military to enforce ft. Sir, if the gentletpan
had attended to the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, speaking on the fubje<3 of internal rev
enue, he would not have made so unqualified an
expression as to the produtft of the txcifc. The
Secretary of the TreafuTy informs, that tbe pro.
dust of the internal revenues for the prefest year
will be eonfiderable more than the year past, for
the year past they were stated at between 300,000
| and 40Â®,000 dollars. With regard to the article
of fnuft, it is obvious to every one that this arefe
from, the advantage that was taken of the law, but
the lav being suspended, there cao he ip further
loss ; and I think that when it (hall ie amended,
we may count upaa a-net prodnft hereafter ,f ro ra
that article. With regard to the article that the
gentleman allsdes to, that the ex C lfe upon had
en'led forth the military to info,roe it, I would only
remark, that it is now become certainly productive
and generally fatisfa&ory, a*d as to the unhtppy
circumftanee ot the .military being- called forth \I
believe that it was not-owing to any inherent pr'm
cip.e of the law, but much more to extraneous cauf.
es, which I (hall cot attempt to explain The
gentleman- went on toobferve tlut*the aujmenta
ti.nof duties would not prove an augmentation of
our revenue, * 1 believcthat lo bc ; ncor .
Â£3c } tlllnk . ,f th Â« gentleman had attended
to the final operations of our government, he would
not have advanced tt,-Sir, our du-ies have been
repeatedly raised, and daily experience convinces
us that our revenue has uniformly been in a st a t e

These confcfiiÂ®nÂ» are very candid. The f A
are perfc&ly in the charaAer of the nation. p er *
haps no nation ob earth take the fame pains and
equally fuccefsful, in worming out the secrets of
other people. The following anecdotes are told
in private circles.
When the negoction of 1783 was pend.W ,h-
Bntifh minister, Mr. Oswald, 1 0 * hi, papcrfco,,.
tainiÃg hu inftruaions. They were taken out of ,
hrt bureau, the locked. Mr. Ofwaid told Mr lay
his papers were gone, and asked him how he ,
trivea tofecure his papers. Mr. Jay replycd, he
Pt tllem IXI a pocket within his coat, usder hU
arm, and when he went to bed, he laid them un.
.er him. But fays Mr. Jay, ye u need t ive y OUr .
leit no uneabnefs about the papers; the French
wimfter has them doubtless and is taking copies
âana when he has done this, the papers will b"
returned to their place. Accordingly, a ft er two
or three days, the papers were replaced in the bu
reau, and the bureau locked aCufual.
V\ hat led Mr. Jay to his conclusion, was, a
knowledge of similar tricks before. During the
war, and while Mr. Jay was in Spain, a certain pa.
per r/as sent by him to thefecretary for foreign as.
fairs in America. The paper arrived fafe. Mot long
after, it was miffing for several days, k then refiored
fafely to ltj piacc. A few months after, and the fir/t
that Mr. Jay beared of it, the French minister in-
Spain showed him a copy of it. A clerk in the
office of foieigu affairs had been bribed, it was
supposed, to obtain the paper for the French minis.
ter in Philadelphia, who copied it, sent back the
original, and a copy to France ; from whence is
was sent to the French minister in Spain.

Porcupine's Gazette.
Proposals by WILLIAM COBBETT, opposite Christ
CHurch, Philadelphia, for publishing a news-paper,
to be entitled
Porcupine's Gazette, <sf Daily Advertiser.
Methinks 1 hear the reader exclaim ; " Whaj ! ha*e
vit not Gazettes enough already !" Yes, and far too F c
n-.any : but those that we have, are, in general, con
duced in such a manner that their great number, in
fteadof rendering mine unneeeffary, is the only cause
that ctlls for its establishment.
The gazettes in this country have done it more realm
jury than all its open enemies ever did or can do. They
mislead the people at home and misrepresent them a
broad. It was these vehicles of sedition and discord
that encouraged the counties in the Welt to rebel ; it
was they that gave rife to the depredations of Britain,
by exerting the people to such atfts of violence against
that nation, as left no room to doubt that we were de
termined on war ; and it was they, when an accom
modation had been happily effeiSled, that flirred up an
eppofition to it such as has seldom been witnessed, and
â which was overcome by mere chance. These gazettes
it was, that, by mifrcprefenting the dispositions of the
people, encouraged the French to proceed from one
degree of insolence to another, till at last their Minis
ter braves thÂ« Prefideot in his chair, and a bullying
commander comes and tells us that his only business is
to seize our vessels, in violation of a treaty,, in virtue
of which alone he claims a right! to enter our parts : and â¢
it \i these gazettes that now have the impudence to de-
fend what their falfehood and malice have produced. of
I (ball be told that the people are -to blame ; that
they are not obliged to read these abominable publica
tions. But they jo read them j and thousands who J
read them, read nothing else. To fupprjfs them is im- J
pofliWe j they will vomit forth thejr poiion ; it is a pri- S<
vilege of their natures, that no law can abridge ; and
therefore the only mode left is, to counteraA its effects.
This must be dose, too, in theirown way. Books, at
or periodical publications 'in the form of books, may
be of some service, but are by no means a match for j"
their flying folios. \ falfeboori that remains uncontra- *â 
difted for a month, begins to be looked upon as a truth,
and when the dete&ion at last makes its appearance, it
is often as useless as that of the doctor who finds his
patient expired. The only method of pppofition, then,
ie to meet them on their own ground ; to set foot to
foot ; dispute every, inch and every hair's breadth;
fight them at their own weaponsj and return them two
blows for one' , r-
A gazette of this (lamp is what I have long wilhed to
fee, but I have wished and Â«xpe<3ed it in vain. Indig-
nation at the fupinenefs of others has at last got th?

fine heelthy eminence, commanding beautiful views in
every direction over the towns Â«f Fredcrickfbi rgh and

and well set with red clover and orchard grass, from
Which three heavy crops of hay are taken every year. Ad
jacent thereto are two large and flourifhing orchards; one
of well chosen peach trees, the other of apple and pear.

The arable lands are fÂ« advantageously divided asts as

lands may be improved by keeping up the inclofure* during <
the intermediate years, or may bp beneficially fallowed for
wheat and other grain ?t the option of the proprietor.
' On the prcmifes there is alio ja merchant mill with one
