upon the propriety of principles which had

he did not contemplate any great ananimity

those whj cotifidercd the nation as placed in
a dangerous fitijation to advocate fueh mea
sures as fliaT! appear to them necessary, what
ever might be the conduA or feotiments of
others j artdlio-.vever flncerely he might wish

tk-men mu.t d.'fptnfe with this advantage,
and do what was rcquiiite for our national

Mr- Pincku E.T could not agree with the
gentleman just fat down, in throwing any
imputation upon gentlen>en who wilhed to

n.itted that part of his observations which
might bear that conftruÂ£l.iijn. Allusions of
this kind were best kept out of fight. He
belie'ed all hnd the fame riÂ«ws. All, he
believed, wifiied to avoid war. He was sure
this wasthe desire of both fides of the heufe.
Unfortnnately they differed in the means
btfl to be put sued for preserving peace
fowe gentlemen think an unprepared state
the best ; others think it is wisest to be pre
pared for the wofft. He was of the latter
opinion ; but he believed that the motives
of gentlemen who differed from him in opin
ion wereequally. pure withhis own. Perfed
unanimity as to the moans to be pursued,
could scarcely be but, he believ
t<J there was a perfefl unanimity both in
that house, and throughout tht 1 country, in
a wifli to avoid a war. With refpefl to the
q'.:efiion before the house, it did not go to
the paint Â» hieh,gcntlemen apprehended.â
7t went only to the providing of the mean!
of prote&icu at house; and the reason why
this fubjefl was now brought forward, he
believed, was owing to the unusual unanim
ity which had appeared in the felecl com
mittee as to the-propriety of the measure.
The consideration of any other meafnres
which might be neceiTary in cgijfequepce of
our <Jifpute wilh France, fueh as arming our
merchantmen, an embargo, or convoys,
would be peflponcd until it was seen whether

Under this idea, Mr. P. thought there was

Itoped gentlemen would, therefore, f*c the
pmpriety of going into a committee of the

upon any particular i'ukjefl, it might be
poftpc.iicd j but he fuppefed there wc-uid be '
certain meafurts upen which there waÂ«ld
be a pretty general Â»gÂ»eemcnt.
Mr. Giies did not suppose a few days
delay would make acy difference en the pre

go, he Â«as as ready t>> adi as any member

the present critical state of our country, be r
thought it was necessary they fh</uid be tin- 1
- ifhed, in order to defend our commerce a- t
1 gainst the pirates of one nation as well as
. those of another ; for he wished to oppÂ»fe }
] the unjust attacks of all. Officers, he said, v
, were appointed for the frigates, and they '
wt re in a llatc of readiness. The one at 1
f Baltimore is ready to bend her fails, and j
might be got into the ocean in four or five
1 weeks. He hoped, therefore, the house <
e would go into this business ; though the o- 1
) ther fubjefts, he thought, would be befi. de- â¢
5 ferred until th: house had further informa
v t">n. .
Mr. Harper, had not the least objection
to going into a committee cf the whole, for
r . the purpofeof voting a sum of money tor
r. completing and equipping the frigates. It
e was to any new measures which might be
necessary with refpeft to a foreign nation,
that he alluded ; and though he felt prepai
!t cd to go into any of the measures proposed,
f. and much stronger ones, yet he saw there
[ t were gentlemen who wished to have farther
rl information before they afted. And when
Id hitlery of the business before
_ them* they would, probably, be convinced
)tt of tlie propriety efjoiniag to carry intoeffeft
>y the measures proposed. If a few votes could
begained by this delay, he was desirous of
e> obtaining them, and he believed the-houfe
, n watild arrive at the end of the business as
jr. soon as if they now to ro into it. Mr. H.
ft juftified the executive*igÂ»iiifi the charge of
delay in not communicating the Britifli a&s
u t and said they were well known to the mer
in chants of the country, as their corielpon
le dents in England took care to give them ev
lc ery interesting information. Â«â 
n . With refpeft to the question of war or
jj. peace, he would state his opinion. The
;k gentleman from Virginia had said that he

aa fever^l li tyjiÂ«|uaÂ«JcnÂ»'w!cdged, that if gentle
.s> men meant by peace, that we (hould sub
mit to the insults of a foreign power, he
â  e . was not for peace, though he wifced to ftt
]y serve it, and would do all he conld to pre
n. lerve.it, if we could obtain redress for our
ig grievances. But if nothing was left to us,
V- but either to submit, or go to war, hecer
re tainly would be for going to war. He be
id lieved that this was the sentiment of the A
ir- merican people, which would be re-echoed
ce from all parts of the Unioa. He believed
id that state of things was -arrived, when this
â  t , country' must either submit, or refifl. He
, n was willing, however, that a delay (hould
c . take place for the communication which
might be expe&ed from the President.
or Mr. Livingston said, until this mo
lis ment, he had determined to give his vote in
p- favor of going into a committee on the state
nt of the Union, for the purpose of voting a
re sum to equip and man the frigates,believing
that that meafore would have no relation to
n. any foreign nation ; but when heard
:h gentlemen fay they were prepared for mar, -
,f. and that the period ivat arrived for it, he
fe dreaded to put arms in their hands, left they
ie (hould be made an ill use of. If from a
â¢d knowledge of the late dispatches the gen

n- men on this fubjeft] and that a declaration

m Sons, he wished to keep back arms. For
d fiuce these sentiments jwere avowed on this
floor, how did he know but the executive
u- might concur in the opinion. [The fpeak
is er said it was not in order to allude to the
m- ; opinion of the executive.] He believed if

,r some others, wete determined not to take t j,<

, e he hoped there would be found a large ma- thi

ft If the gentleman from Virginia wished

f e would fay it was those who constantly im- b*
a, peached the Executive authority ; who ut- d<
â¢J. tered sentiments which had a tendency to w
0 f dispirit the people, and lead them to believe
they could not be defended, and that cam- w

Mr. O. agreed that a change ofour Ctuatii,,' 1,

portarice ; it confiiied in the intelligence receir.
Ed from our envoys extraordinary that they Kit
sot been officially receired by the goiernment
of France, though they hÂ«(J remained in that
country about three months. The queftioa
was, whetbe.r that intimation in itfelf is fuflU
cient to induce coKgreft to adopt new mei
fares, or to take up such as were rejected at the
last feflion. To him there was not fufficient
reafou for this porpo r e ; hecaufÂ« hÂ« expend
farther information upon this fubjtfl j and un.
less the bouse kneu , not only that our wmifttr,
hid not been reeeivtd, but wliy they hid not
. been received,and whether it was from the want
, of powers, or any ejrcumftances not kno*nto
u >, it was difficult to fay what meafares eujht
to ke taken.
Another reason was, though our tnjSiftai
themfclves inform the executive that they hut
> net been received, nor have any hopes of it, or
- thiit the et their nsiflion will be acton.
Â» plifbed, they still refrain in Vatis ; and fÂ» W 1
j as they remain there, 2towÂ«ver " feeble their
hope, they have some hope of being received,n
. they would leave the place,as itmuft be unpia

I So long as we had not information that they
1 had left the country, he did not thiak any nor
measures ought te be gone into, Â«r meafurn
j which, in their tendency, must lead to war.â
When he said this, he did not mean to fay any
' thing againflt taking meafureo of felf-defenct,
e We ought to take every measure of this kind j |
i- but, unfortunatelj, however easy this was to be
dene on land, it could net be carried to fta,
0 without danger of war. Such is the naturt of
c ! felf-defence at sea, that if it be carried eit of
} our own jurifdi<slioa, it is uatimatily tonaefltd
with offenlive operatioas.
e Thus with refpefl to armingef mcrtkanttncn,
by putting arms into the hands of iadividutli,
iJ it might lead to war, whilil they wereintesii

It session. The fame reason, however, which W
li the honfets rejedl thismeafÂ»rÂ«liÂ«ytofÂ»re woÂ»14
JS lead them to oppose taking it up at thi) time.
It remaiaed to be conftdered whether it wooM
r P ro P er 10 FÂ® '"to a committee on those mtv
" fures which were agreed to at the iaft frffien ;
rs but .which now required further appropriations.
16 There were two such measures, via. the frigate*
.. and fortifications. With refptft to the foit.fi
1C eatioas, he was always willing to appropriate 11
, much as was neceflary for this objefl,
ference evÂ«r took place on this ftibjeifl, except as
!Cl to amount appropriated. He flinuld, there
fort, have no objection to this mLfure ; kul it
le was net neceflary to begone inte at preltnt; it
1 j would do to be considered any time during thi*
c _ session, aÂ« there remains a balaace of 90,00*
,j_ dollars unexpended of tbe last appropriation.
The only taeafure which seems necefliryts
be g-ire inte at present is the frigates. Thi
'd otjeifl;Â«n made to this measure had been, that
3r the executive might employ the frigates in ii
m improper maaner. This apprehenfi*u he fup
n. posed to be grounded upon the firft feflioa or
the aist of last fefiion, whieh gives the preMeot
, the right of employing them, without rfftriftios.
' If it was their opiaios that the preCdent wsuid
employ the frigates in * manner dingeroui te
1- the peace of the country, it would be Â« good tr
y guiucl.t againlt appropriating the money ;an 4
1 t it would be within the recolleflien of members,
that the sense of the house' was twice taken i*
favour of reftriifliag the use ot the frigates; but,
e for fear of losing the bill, this point wisgiÂ«Â»
up. Though, however, he was at that timca
'P gainfl the president's having a discretion to sle
a, the frigates as he pleased, he was not nowafri i
id of their being employed improperly. He hiJ
;n always sppofed tbe building of the frigates in
.jj every stage, because he thought the expenfltÂ«-
tending them, would be greater than tbe adrH*
a tage to be derived from them ; but he did not
a " wilh now to oppose the motion for gding intoa
d committee on thia fubje<a.
With refpedl to the question of W, Mr. 0.
it did itot believe any gentleman could with (or it
r _ as an abftradl good. He believed every one
j thought it an evil ; but he believed there Â«" re
gentlemen in the house who would be willing tÂ»
go to war, for caofes whi:h others did not think
in jaflifiable. He did not know, indeed, but w"'"
1- they eame to go into the fubjtdl that they
ts all ?gree ; but he believed this was the diltmu
re ion to be drawn betwixt the different opiÃi"*'
j as tiiflerent geatfjmen.
|e Two ether reasons might perhaps be alledg
, why the house Ihould not go into committee on
' this fubjeÂ£l ; the one wk, because the t- >-
had paftponed for an enquiry into tbe u
e> je<9 of former expcncea, and the ctim* I '-'
le enquiry have not reported, for his own F 'â 
J8 he believed tbcre had bÂ«en much e * tr f" 3 %'
J t in the expeaditar* ; but as no report * *
1 j njade, and as it could not be ioo n ' x P e .' .
believed those gentlemen who , t4 , t k "
a fr.gatss equipped had better pioceen ' n 1 c
\ r.n?f 3 without this report. The etner reaf.Â»
le was, that he thought the house had net â  .
13, information relive to the pay and fu 1 c c -
fs tbe navy. When the account Â«>Â»
laid before the house, the, ration* ' ere^ c ,'

ROUEN, January i. o
We can now announce the certainty of 0
the arrest of cheva'ticr d'Aranjo, the Por- v
tuguefe ambador, who remained at Paris Â§
after the order for his departure, given him c
r in confequentejof his court having refufed t<
1- to ratify the tÂ»eaty which had been conclu- w
- ded between its plenipotentiary and the
e French republic.
i Aranjo was sent to the temple, and seals
e placed upon his papers. It appears that
â¢ this ambafTador, who was formerly viewed
t in a favorable light, has been the dupe of
e Wifcovich, a well known intriguer, now in ,|,
r arrest. This Wifcovich always used to pay Ti
â  great court to foreign envoys, from whom
; he drew large funis of money, by making
them believe, that he could warp certain ,h,
s members of the government. M. d'Aran- tn
e jo deceived and abused by this fellow, it is
( said wrote home, that with a million more tlt
r he could obtain from certain directors, ad- c it
I vantageoug conditions for the treaty of
peace with Portugal. The,affair of M. Qui- I,l '
