r ~pHE Mavacfrs paiticularly rcqueft the con
i_ currence of thr public in the abolition of a
custom, which has hitherto obtained, of giving m
vay or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at the
Theatre.
They are aivare that gentlemen are nnconfcious
of any wlong i'Â®re to tje interest of the inilitu
tionby this practice, from a general, though rnif
ta>en idea that Checks are the representatives iÂ»f a
right to so many, feat" in the Theatre, during*an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will;
when in fact, they were never intended as more
than tektni by which the Poor-keepe Â»are enabled .
to ascertain with the least trouble to the W<Â«,that
t/jij tbcmfelvcs have been befor? in the Theatre, or
paid'for their admiflion.
Independent of the injury the Managers fuflain, t
such a pi'aittce enconragts a croud of idle boys and '
other disorderly parsons to surround the. doors of j
the Theatre, to the coiruption of their morals and f j
the great annoyance of the Audience. |
It has alio been the source of two evils of no in- j 1

For the Gazette of the United States.
MR. FEN NO,
" I have not the fmallell daubt but Con
gress will duly appreciate the advice of" the
learned gentleman who signs himfcrlf " an
Enemy to Nonsense," and though I do not
think ' right and juftiee'entirely wrong,both
fecm to have drawn very hasty conclusions.
Not over tjnacious of my own fpiuioiis, 1
entertain and treat with due rtfpeft the fen
timenti of those who differ with me.
The nonfenfual gentleman like many other
reafonor3 would no doubt lay a ivagtr also to
convince Congress and the public " that he
alone can think or argue" ! Now as to his
"arithmetical logic," though ihe cargo tak
en may go to market it it to an island or
port of an enemy of the other, and though
that port or all the ports of thsÂ»t enemy may
have a superabundance of necefiariee, if the
neighbouring island be Jlarving it cannot ex
pe3 or obtain relief frcm thence ; it is not
therefore " in competition with our wther
produce, and so lowers the market."
" One other delullen," that the loss to the <
country is exaftly the fame in all cases of
misfortune to individual property " when
nothing is returned for it," but when one
veflel in four bound- to the fame port is tak
en and carried to people at enmity therewith,
the other three upon general calculation ob
tain and bring bzck the value of the fourâ
when a veflel founders it is a national loss, if
uninsured it is both individual and national.
I do not " fear our merchants and under-"
writers being convinced" by " an enemy to
nonsense," that they should do .wrong, or
that they cAn pglnfrun. j "try m
ny measure : âhe recommends. He may
not be thought ft much an enemy tp nonsense
as he imagines.
As to " she whole statement" of right
and jufti'ce," it is not so much " a mifrfpre
fentatioji" as the want of cool examination
of the causes that Have produced " the dif
trefTed situation of eur commerce.",
Mr. Swanwick has written a pamphlet
not to prove the'eontrary of any thing av
erted by me, but to afford positive evidence
to every body that will have the patience to
read it, that instead of being worth nine dol
lars his creditors will probably get that
much from his estate !
" The situation of our prison" demands a
general bankrupt law to compel honefly andre
lievt misfortune." It is to be regretted that
our merchants-become fpecolators & our spe
culators merchants ; the fortuitous gains of
a season or a voyage was mijlalenly (onfalter
ed as an income ! The man who made twen
ty or ten thousand dollars by aecident seems
to have thought he had so much a year and
was entitled to set up a carriage and live in
y?:7c,ir.fteadof wifely reflecting that he should
ufc it as a capital, or an increase of his cap
ital, the benefit of which only he was autho
rized to spend. IVe have been drawing too
much upon the wealth of future times ; . our
commerce has not so much out-grown the
natural disposition of its strength as the ideas
of some of our merchants in not confidcr
ing that throughout the world it has been
and wjll continue liable to ebbs and flows ; .the
| wife will and benefit by the turns of
:h<j tide, and the weak and thcrunwary will
be neapt.
In Dunlap and Claypoole'i paper in June
or July 1795, upon the appearance of a
rupture between Spain and Great-Britaiu,
I ventured to' express an opinion " that it
was advisable to adopt a state of ftri& neu
trality," and recommended a proclamation
,to that effeft (under another fignatufe) ;
it did not then become neceflary, but when
the present war commenced it. was ifiiied and
the beneficial effeftsofit are universally ad
mitted. Mr. Ames eloquently urged the
fullfilment of the treaty with Great-Britain
te avoid a war, and our late beloved Prtfulent
wifely cautioned us to " beware in our re
sentment against om natiog not to throw
ourselves into the feale of another." Are
we then hastily now to forego or hazard in
the mojl diflant degree all the blcftings of peace
and internal tranquility to be revenged on
" a Fiench marauder ?" No Mr. Fenno, we
had much better be five years without any fo
reign commerce (we can do very well without
it) than one year with war. Wt have cho
sen to negotiate, and until that is at an end
the United States cannot with propriety
take any other step.
A FRIEND TO LAWS & FREEDOM.

From a IVafhington (Penn.J Paper.
EXTRACT
FROM BACHE'S PAPER OF NOV. 6.
ExtraÃ of a letter from a Gentleman in Wash
ington County, to his friend in this City,
dated 6Sober 17 I 797.
" The Republican Ticket has carried by
a great majority in this County for the AsÂ»
fembly. ,
" The Aristocrats succeeded in getting
their SenatorâJohn Woods is eleftedâ
The dittrift of Pittsburgh turned out nine
hundred votesâlt is said they have but five
hundred taxables, we may therefore conclude,
that there has nqt been fair play. BeGdes
the Addifon junto fixed upon a stratagem
which lc cured Wood's Eleftion, and they
were confident also of carrying Mem
bers of Affcmbly. The buiinef6 was this:
Addifon by management got himfelf ap
pointed a of the Ele&ion for the dif
triÂ£l of Wafinrigton, the result therefore,
was, that the Ele&ion lavvgf 1785 vvps en
forced in this diftrift. No man was allow
ed to vote who did not produce his certifi
cate of alleigance, or made oaih that he had
done so agreeably to the afts of afiembly,
or naturalized agreeably to the aits of Cbn
grefs. By this febeme, four hun
dred in this diftrift were deprived of voting, !
whose votes would hzve been alri;o!t to a
man against the junto, as the. i igiiers here
are generally republicans.
I "In Pittsburgh they pursued a different
j planâthere they let every body vote, and
I more than everv bodyâfurthe* they kept
emiflfaries at the' windows to foree the people
to put in their tiekets. âOne of these emis
saries, since the eleftion, has been heard to
fay that " they treated the damn'd rascals
1 (meaning tl>e country people, &c.) as.they
' ought, to be ; fur on their comihg up It vote, if
I they had not their ticket, they obliged them to
change before they got leave to put them in."
--â¢ V I
The abdve evtraft from Bache's paper
(the common fewet'of all the filth in the
date) is 4 small fpeciinwi of that impudence
and falfehood which the meancft of those
they call demdtfrafts trumpet abroad, to de
ceive simple men. If one may form a con
jeflure from its (fyle and matter, it is the
joint work of Sleepj Davie and Dr. Mor
pheus, tfie vise' min of the East and the
Weft. They carried on a very pretty cor
refpoiidcncc of this kind, jull before the lad
election of electors, and, from their great
deputation in this wiy, it is not at at all un
fair to set them down as the putative fathers
of all the trash from Washington to Phila
delphia.
The- impudence of calling the fuccefsful
ticket for representatives in Washington
county, the republican tifcket, is only match
ed by calling the men termed democrats re
publicans by way of distinction. It will
not fcrYe them to compare thtf understanding
and virtue of the two tickets or the two par
ties. A set of Wretches in France, the otoft
notorious fÂ«r {.heir crimes and theirbafenefi,
for their hatred to all religion and all govern,
ment but that of mobs and clubs, were dis
tinguished by the name of excluftve patriots.
The Pharisees amoig the Jews affe&ed to
be righteous and dyfpifed others. Tliey
were po(Â»pou4,prtCPudtrs to. religion,' but
noted for hypocrisy and oppression. Ttiis
letter writer and his republicans are of this
class, or the dupes of fiich. They are Sthe
Freach exclusive patriotsâthe Pharisees in
politicsârW-hited fepplchres which indeed
appear beautiful without, but within arc
full of rottenness and dead men's liones.â
There are among them men of, warm arid en
thwfiafUe minds who fancy all men as ready
to be governed by rcaton as themselves, de
rive all their notions of government from
theory, and have never had them cerrefled
by experience. There are alfd among them
honest apd simple men, who have never had
an opportunity of examining the principles
and tulesof government, who believe every
rant, every tale, and every (lander; and
whose credulityisferverted into a confidence
that our government is oppression, and our
officers tyrants. , These men may sometimes
deserve our pity, sometimes our esteem.
But the base and detestable class of our felf
flyled republicans is ps another kind. Some
times ignorant, sometimes intelligent, some
times weajt, fonaetiines able, they are vain,
impudent,"eftvious malignant and flauderous
âand.their malice and dÂ«famation is always
in proportion to the.virtue and refpeftabili
ty of the ctiara Aer they attack. From such
men what good and great man can hope to
efcapc, when " not IVifhington himfelf is
fafe."âTheir praise it a certain mark of
disgrace, and their obloquy of merit. The
wife willalk up other encomium than their
censure ; nor desre a more pointed stigma
on bad men than their applause. It is an
indelible mark on every Cain of the country.
Of this kind are your letter-writers who.
write of things which never happened, and
your letter-publilheri who publidi letters
that never were written. And it is by their
lies and misrepresentations) that discontents
murmurs and confufions are bred among
ourfelvesâraud injuries and contempt tow
ards lis foftered in foreign nations.
" The ariflocrats succeeded in getting
their senatorâJohn Woods eleited."
And this is attributed to fraud in Pktfburg,
and'the exclusion of three or four hundred
unqualified votes in Washington. As to
the word ari/loirat, I have never undertfood
what it meant, and thought even the silliest
Were* afilamed to use it its a terra of reproach.
.If fnccefs in eleftion were any tell of ehar
after, a comparison between the'two-candf
dates would itelf-juftHy the success of Mr.
Woods. He had in the three counties put
together, a majority of nearly 700 votesâ
and in the county of Allegheny, where he
and Mr. Morton both lived, a fnajority iÂ»f
nearly 900. In Greene county Mr. Mor
ton had a majority of about 16, and in
Washington county of about aoo. In these*
cotintiee Mr. Morton hada great advantage,'
he was but little known, and his qualifica
tions were taken on the word of republican
letter-writers. I believe Mr. Morton is an
honed man enough, and may make a very
decent member, oreven elder, in any church.
But surely he is no Solomon, and it will
hardly be pretended that hchasthe qualifica
tions of a legidator.
" The diftritt of Pitt(burg tuVned out
nink hunbrep votesâlt 'n said they have
but five hundred taxables." This will do ve
ry well for Philadelphia ; but, foolifh and
lying as the author is, he would not, I
think, have liked to have ptfhlilhed this in
Pittfbilrg. This is a lie of uncommon im
pudence. There are, I think, at ftaft five
hundred taxables in the borough of Pittf
burg itfelf ; and in the didrii!t of Pittf
biirg; whyre there were but nine hundred
votes, there be at lea(t fifteen hun
dred toters', exclusive of the settlers 011 the
wed of the Allegheny river, and north of
the Ohio river. For this diftriA includes
an extent rtf perhaps t\Venty miles On the O
hio and Monongahela, and fotrr or five miles
back from those riversâand perhaps twen
ty-four miles on the Allegheny and Monon--
gabela, and spur or five miles back from
those rivers.âAnd, belides these it includes
all the new settlements on Beaver, and all
the other settlements wed of the Allegheny
and north of the Ohio, except the CufTawa*
go and Prefqu'ifle settlements. What an
impudent liar this republican Is! And,
when thisrvaft. drftiiiV.mnitd out but 900
votes, how malignant is his concliifion,
" that there Was not fair play."
What is said of" the Affdifon junto,dra
tagem, and management," ir. tpo unmean
ing, in it a present fhape,'to dcfai ve any re
mark, A better opportuqity will perhaps
occur. I (hall now only fay, it i 9 foolifli as
Davie Acbefon's petitions, and falfe as his
affidavits.
" Yhe election law of 1785 was enforced
in the diftridt of Walhington. No man
was allowed to vot,e who did not produce
his certificate of allegiance, or made oath
that he had done so agreeably to the adte
Of alfembly, or naturalized agreeably to the
a&s of congress."âNothing is more odious
to your republicans of thin, damp than en
forcing laws ; and this is what they hate
mod in officers. Government and officers
would be very liarmlcfs and good things if
they would not enforce laws, and re lira in
the rights of republicans to do what they
please, whether lawful or unlawful. The
statement made by this letter-writeris about
as true, as that which he and his brother
republicans spread all over Washington
county, when David Achefon'; vote was
rejefted, as an alien, at the township election
for an Honeft David sent ex
prefles to the feverjl didrifts to inform
them, that all the IRISH were to be ex
cluded ; âand a wife uncla. of his said witti
ly I suppose, they were all to be .hanged.
The truth is, that the law, not of 1785
but of 1789, was .enforced again (tall aliens,
whether.lrifh or ScotchâBut no man born
in Americaâno man who in any of
the United States, at their separation from
Britainâno man, who in 9ny way was an
American citizen, was ever called to pro
duce a certificate, or other proof, of his
having taken an oath of allegiance. Yet
it was reported, and you fee the republican
letter-writer reports, v that a certificate or
oath was. required from all and this was, so
well believed,jhaf, when it was known that
representative Achefon* s feat.would.#e dis
puted, Jsecairfe he was not a citizen ; a col
league of his in the republican ticket was a
fraid that he, though a native of Pennsyl
vania would also be turned out, becaufehe
had never taken an oath ofajlegiance. Whe
ther it was the alien, representative that in
spired this fear in the citizen, to secure one
vote for himfelf, I did not enquire.
That it is proper to exclude aliens from
any agency in our government I think no
wife man will doubt. Before they under
take to judge or to manage our intereds,
they ought to have time to learn them.â
And, after the term of probation is expired
it is reasonable, that there be some solemn
\*(k of their adtniffion as citizens. The let
ter-writer will tell you why. " The foreign
ers here are generally republicans." Often
coming from governments whiclithey hate,
t-hey are told by ouÂ» republicans here, that
our government and officers hive all the
faults of every other. Lies are made and
tales ffcigned, to confirm* their opinion.
Strangers hare no means of dete&ing the
misrepresentation, they beliete all, join
themselves with the ftanderers, and are hon
ored with tjie title of republicans. After
some years they get better information, or
their own observation enables them to cor
reft their mistakes: from foreigners they
beepme citizens; but Alas! 0111 exclulive
patriots no longer own them as republicans.
"In Pitt (burgh, they pursued a differ
ent planâthere they let every body voteâ
and more than every body"âProdigious!
âYes and they did "force the people to
put ill their tickets." What barbarian Ar
istocrats thofc people of Pitt(burgh are !
Yes and " they treated the damn'd rascals
(meaning" to be sure " tbc country people,
&c.) as they ought to be, This I take to
be one of the plain down-right lies, which
it is not lawful for any but a republican to
utter. It does not fee'm to have the lead
mixture of Ariftgcratic truth, or even to fc?
at all corrupted with probability. I (hall
not therefore pollute it with any obfm va
tion of mine. *
SlirEÃ COIN FOUND
On the I Bth Aug. soon after the removal of
a dung heap in a yard â  at Winterborne Stoke,
Wilts, an earthen vtffel containing 301 pieces
of silver coin, -was discovered, the top of the
vessel being even with the fut'face of the earth
The coins are all of the reign of James I. and
Charles I. and notwithjianding the situation
in which they lay, are remarkablefrefh and
â¢wellprefervrd. It is conjeÃured they were bu
ried during the civil war in Charles's reign,
when probably fume building covered the spot,
and that fsnce, a dung heap has f>een laid there,
its repeated removals have occasioned the earth
to be gradually scraped away, till it became
even with the rim of the vessel. A girl of
fourteen, daughter to the farmer who occupies
the yard, d\fcovered the prize, and removed it
with (jfe to her fathers'* house. âEng.Pap.

further consideration of the petitions of
Israel Jones and Edward" Johnson, as they,
had already bten reported upon at>a former
fefiion, awd no frefh facts appeared to in
duce the committee to report differently-
Agreed.
The fame gentleman made an unfavour
able report on the petition of Mary Ivings,
which was concurred ifi by the house.
Mr. Harper, from the committee of ways
and means* made a report on the petition
of William Tomlinfon, and others, citizens
of Virginia, who complained of being
ed by the aft relative to the distilling of spi
rits,' to take out licences at inconvenient
seasons. The report recommends a lavr to
be passed to obviate their complaints. It
was committed for to-morrow.
Mr. Livingftoti, from the commute of
commerce and manufactures, reported a bill
for the relief of North and Vcfy, of Charles- -
ton;â Committed for to-morrow Â» i
On motion of Mr. Harper, the house re-,
solved itfelf into a committee of the whole,
on certaio resolutions which were lately re
ported, prescribing the mode of taking e*i
dence in safes of contested eleftions. They
were agreed to both in the committee of the
whole, and in the house, without debate,
and a bill direfted to be brought in accord
ingly.
Mr. Venable, from the committee to
whom was referred the resolution for sus
pending the second feftion of the aft for re
gulating foreign coin, and ether purpofes,i
reported a bill, which was twice read, and
committed for to-morrow.
Mr. Wadfworth moved the order of the
day on the bill authorising the President of
the United States to poftpoiie the meeting
of Congress in certain cafe J. The house
accordingly went into a committee of the
whole on the fubjeft, and, after making a
verbal the committee rose, and
the houft-agreed toil; when
Mr. Gallatin moved a provision to the
following effeft : " Provided that the day
to which the meeting shall be postponed
(hall flat exceed thirty days from the day to-,
which Congress flood adjourned.'!
Mr. Harper could not fee any good effeft
which this amenndment was calculated to
produce. If the gentleman -were of opin

President of the United States wi|Ji thÂ«
power of postponing the meeting qf Con
gress, in cafe of a contagious sickness, or o
ther calamity, the fafeft way would be
rejeft the bill; but the present motion, he
thought, (hewed great hostility, and the
highest difrefpeft, to the President of the
Uuited States.
Mr. Gallatin said, it was extraordinary,
that upoa an amendment to a bill veiling a
ppwer in the President of the Unitfd States,
which was not given to hita by the coafti
tution, because he did not wi(h to invest him
with the powsr, without limitation, he
fliould be charged wijh a want of confidence
and a want of refpeft. He fuppafed, that
so far as related to confidence, they wertr
bound to give the President just so much as
the constitution required, and no. more.â
Confidence beyond this he did not veiy well
understand. As to the motion's containing
a want of refpeft to the President, that
charge was (till less applicable. Refpeft,
he said, could only be personal, and could,,
of courje, only apply to the present Presi
dent ; whereas the bill under consideration
did not relate to him only, but to all future
Presidents of the Unilcd States. How the
argument of difrefpeit to men not. yet. iij
existence, could apply, he was at loss to
know. Cvt, he said, it was no uncommon
thing, whenever gentlemen Offered in opin
ion on any fubjeft touching another branch
of the government, however harmless that
opinion might be, to be charged with a want
of confidence and refpeS towards it. He
(houhl, however, never be deterred from aft
ing as he ahought right h,y such arguments.
Mr. G. referred to that part of the CÂ®n
ftitytioH where it is said, that, " neither
House, during the feflion of Congref*, (hall
without the consent of the other, adjourn
for more than three days, nor to any other
place than that in which the two Houses
(hall be fitting and also to that where
power is given to the President " to con
vene both houses, or either of then* on ex
traordinary occalions ; and, in cafe of dis
agreement between them, with refpeft to
the time of adjournment, he may adjourn
them to such time as he may think proper."
It wa3 clear, therefore, that the two houses
had the exclusive power to adjourn to what
ever time they pleased, only that in cafe of
difagretment, the President had the power
to adjourn them j but this bill went to vest
the power in the President of fixing another
period of meeting than that agreed upen by
the two houses. This, he said, was a de
licate fubjeft, and he thought they ought
not, upon so (light a vie.-v as the prefc.t
bill had received, to part with a power,
without some limit, which the Constitution
had placed in their Hands. What was the
ground, he alked, upon which the hill was
founded ? The President had fuggefttd, in
his Speech, the propriety of giving him
the power, in cafe of similar returns of con
tagions sickness, to poflpone the meeting
of- Congress. It had been suggested that
in the month of November, the President
had had doubts whether he (hould convene"
Congress in another place, in conformity to
the poweV placed in him for that plirpofe ;
but that if'. ehad had the power tohave con*
ventd them a few|days later, he would have
done it. The limited power which he pro-'
posed to give would enable the President, in
any future" emergency, to do this, and if,
from contagious sickness, invasion or any o
ther.cause, a longer postponement (honld ap
pear to be necessary, be tho't it would tebetter tUflf Conjjrefs fhruld be convened at
some other place, t:nn that furh a postpone
ment should take place. He did not think
the President asked for more than this 5 and
so far from being difrefpeftful, he thought
it the only way in which the bill could be
agreed to.
Mr. Harper admitted, that if nb other
cafe were contemplated by this bill than the
one lately experienced, the proposed limit
might be admitted, as harmlcfs ; as by the
Constitution, Congress must have been in
fefiion about the beginning of December,
and thirty days would not have elapsed from
the second Monday in November to the pe
riod fixed by the constitution for the meet
ing of Congress. He truft:d, however,
they should tot pass a law without an ofcjcft.
Suppose, said he, Congress flood adjourned
to the Ift of July, or lft of August, and
a contagious disorder should break out, or
an enemy invade the city, a few day* before
eit'uet of those periods, might it not be de
finable that the President (hould have the
# pÂ«wer of postponing the meeting for longer
than thirty dap* ? If such a disorder were
to break out in June, could it be supposed
that it would subside in July, when it was
clear to every one that nothing but froft. will
fiut an end to the contagion ? This amend
ment, therefore, where it could be afted up
on' at all, would be mischievous, aad in other
cases perfectly nugatory. As to refpeft and
confidence,-he did not mean that they should
be induced by them to do an im;n oper thing.
Cut if it were proper to place the power in
question in the hands of the President, he
would not have it so placed as to be nuga
tory and foolifh. The gentleman had found
out that refpeft could only be personal,
though all mankitid had agreed that refpeft
might be paid to offices, separate from per
sons. He never supposed that the law
would be particularly difrefpeftful to the
present President; but it seemed to (hew too
grt'at a jealousy of the Executive Depart
ment. The 1 gentleman feemed-to think the
difficulty would be removed by the Prefi
dertt's- having the power to convene Con
gress at-a different place; but he did not
consider what expence and trouble would
attend a removal of all the Machinery of
government. He could not suppose that if
the proposed power were placed in the Pre- |
fident, that he would postpone Congress for (
a longer period, at arty time, than was ne
cessary. His own credit would be a fuffi
cient guard agaiiaft this. The Gentleman
from Pennsylvania himfelf could scarcely be
lieve that it would not.
Mr. Swanwick said, that when congress
adjourned to any other day than that fixed
th|> Constitution, they had doubtless
some reason for doing so. If this were the
cafe, why (hould they put it in the power of
the President to fruftrate their views. But
th* expence of removing the government
had been objefted against. This could not
be allowed to be so great an evil as the part
ing with the power which had been vested in
them, of fixing their own time of meeting.
He thought the motion of his colleague to
limit the postponement to thirty days, would
be'' lite fuffieient, if fnch a power was ne
cessary at all, though be thought that of
convening congress at any other place, was
fuffieient tp guard against the contingencies
which Wfbeen mentioned.
' Mr. Nicholas believed giatleraen could
not fifrnre to themselves a cafe where, if a
postponement were proper, thirty days
would not be a fuffieient time. The con
stitution said, they (hould meet once a year;
but that the two houses (hould have power
to adjourn themselves to any time that they
thought proper ; and if they agreed to meet
in July or August, as the gentleman from
S. Carolina had fuppoftd, was it proper that
the President of, the United States (hould
have thepower of preventing them ? He would
agree, that in all likelihood, his refpeft for
his own charafter and his refpofibility,
Would in general, prevent him from mak
ing an improper use of this power ; yet still
it was a power vested in the legifiature, and
it fhonld be recollefted that in placing the
different powers of the government, there
had always been a jealousy over the execu
tive. He could well suppose that c Yes
might exist, where the wishes of a President
to do right, might be counterafted by in
terefl. It was possible that the President
and legifiature might have different views,
and it might be extremely important to him
to effeft his purposes, to have the power of
postponing the meeting of congress. If
these different cases were within the view of
the framera of the constitution, when they
arranged the several powers of the govern
ment, they ought to be touched with a de-,
licate hand. The law before them was
meant to operate principally against any fu
ture contagious sickness. To give the pow
er of l postponing congress for five or fix
months, would he an improper power. No
thing that he had fcen of the present gov
ernment could lead him to suppose that such
a situation of things as tbat which he had
mentionad (hould ever take place, by a disa
greement in the different branches, but he
believed the distribution of powers had been
made with a view to thefe 1 differences. He
therefore hoped, the power would be limit
ed.
Mr. Thatcher did not know that the
house could be engaged on a fubjeft of less
importance than the present amendment ;
for if they looked back upon a'l the adjourn
ments which had taken place since the com
mencement of tfie government, there had
been only one or two cases in which the .a
mendment could have operated ; and it was
not. probable that in fifty years to came,
there would be another. He supposed a
number of cases, in which the amendment
would either have no effeft, or a bad one.
He hoped, therefore, it )vould be disagreed
tq.
Mr- Wadfworth could fee no good effeft
which itie amendment could produce, as the
time was already limited by the constituti
onal day, and thinking it unncceffary, he
(hould be opposed to it.
, The question upon the amendment was
p\it, and negatived, 4.5 to 44.
1 lie question now heuigon the engrossing
of the bill for a third reading,
Mr. N. Smith said, he did not at present
fee the propriety of palling this bill. Per
haps gentlemen in favour of it, could fatis
faftorily explain its principles. They had
not been explained, and until tjiey were, he
should not be willing to vote for it. The
Constitution, he said, provided that there
should be one session in a year, commencing
the firft Monday in December. Thebill be
fore them provided that whenever an earlier
period of meetiag should be fixed by law,
that the President (hould have the power to
poftpon* the meeting, provided that the
postponement did notgo beyond the consti
tutional day. Now he supposed there Viould
not be a meeting of Congress before the
constitutional day, except by an express
law. If this were the cafe, it followed, that
whenever the legifiature should pass a law
for an earlier meeting, they could at the
fame time provide for asy difficslty which
might arise. Tire Prttfidefit might be au
thorised to delay the meeting, in cafe of ne
cessity, to the constitutional day, or any o
ther ; but why pass a general law to provide
for inconveniences which may possibly grow
out of some future law ? He had heard of
legiflatureS. providing for difficulties arising
from laws which they had passed, but never
far fueh as might be' supposed to grow out
of future laws, the parting of which was
wholly uncertain. As well might they fit
down and provide for inconveniences which
may grow out of a law laying a land tax ;
since that law may pass, and some gentlemen
may wish and expeft it will pass. He tho't
however, it would be timÂ» enough to pro
vide for the difficulties arising under it, af
ter it was passed. He might be told that
be told that the law, notwithstanding the
objeftion he had brought against it, would
do no harm; but this was not a fuffieient
reason for him to vdte for it : before lie did
this, he must believe it would dogotd.
The question on engrossing was Â£ut, and
negatived, 58 to 32. Of course tbe bill
was'loft.
Mr. Livingfton, from the Committee of
Commerce and Manufaftiires, made an un
favourable report on the petitions of Archi
bald Cook, Abiel Wood, and Robert Coo
per, who all prayed for the remission of duty
on goods, which had been loft and deftroy
|ed.
On motion of Mr. Sewall, this report
was re-committed, as he said he had receiv
ed some frelh documents in support of the
claim of R. Cooper. Mr. Thatcher also
wished that the cafe of Cook and Wood
might be also recommitted.-*âAgreed.
Mr. A. Foster called for the order of the
day oh the report of Committee of
Claims on the petition of Edward St. Loe
Liv<;rmore, â  which being agreed to, the
House went into a comuiitte of the whole
on the fubjeft.
i It appears that from the fingalar situati
on of the Judge of the Diftrift of New-
Hampshire, on the 3d of April, 1794, Con
gress were induced to pass an aft, whereby
the duties enjoined on the Diftrift Judges,
by the aft " to regulate the claims to inva
lid pensions," were transferred, as far as re
luted to the diftrift of New-Hampshire, to
*he Attorney of the said diftrift, whose du
ty it was thereby made to perform the fame.
The objeft of this petition is to obtain com
penfatio* for the difeharge of thÂ£ said duties
> and as duties have been required and per
formed under the laws of the United States,
by the petitioner, the committee conceived
; he was entitled to a reasonable compensation
j and submitted a rrfolution to the House, au
thorising the accounting officers of the
Treasury to fettle his account.
This report occasioned some debate. It
was supported as reasonable by Messrs. D.
and A. Foster, Gordon and Brookes, and
opposed by Messrs. Nicholas and Coi|, 011
the ground, that no expence was ever con
templated to be incurred by the business in
question, and that if they allowed a compen
sation in this cafe they might expeft appli
cation from all the officers of the United
States, whenever any new duty was laid u
pon them by laws subsequent to their ap
pointment.
The report was negatived 43 to 31, and
the House concurred in the votes.
Mr. Sitgrcaves said, the House had made
afubjeft the order of the day for to-morrow
upon which he did not think they had fuf
fieient information; he meant the bill rela
tive to Foreign Coins. The last report
which had been received from the Direftor
of the Mint was in 1796, and all the calcu
lations which had been made in the course
of the late debate were founded upon that
Report, and not upon the present aftual
state of that establishment. He should,
therefore, propose a resolution to the fol
lowing effeft:
" Resolved, that the direftor of the mint
be direfted to report to this House a state
ment of all the Bullion deposited in the mint
since his last report, and an account of gold
and Silver Coin issued from the Mint in the
fame period; distinguishing in the ftatcment
of deposits, the Foreign Coin from the Bul
lion."
Mr. Nicholas had no objeftion to this
if it were not meant to postpone
confideration of the bill which the gen
tleman had alluded to; as any postponement
of that business would have the effeft which
some gentlemen had said was already pro
uuced, of dbing all the mifchief which the
aft, if not repealed, was calculated to pro
duce. He could fee no "ffeft which this re
port could produce as to the bill in ques
tion.
Mr. Sitgrcaves said, the gentleman from
Virginia misapprehended his intention, if he
supposed he meant to delay for a single mo
ment the bufiuefs he alluded to. If he had
any such intentions, he would have taken a
direst mode of effefting his purpose: he left
it to others to pursue their ends by indireft
means. He wished only to correft the state
ments which had been made on tbe fubjeft,
collefted from an old report, ".'Mch might
be done and sent to the Houfo by to mor
row morning.âCarried.
Mr. Sewall presented the petition of Si
mon Forrefter, praying for the *mifi)on of
the duty on certain hemp which had been
destroyed by lire.âRcferre" tÂ« the commit
tee of commerce and manufactures.
On motion of Mr. Sftgwaves, the reso

Captain Rumford, of ths brig Sir John
Wcntworth, in 21 days from Martinique,
informs us,, that two days previous to his
failing, an English armed brig belonging to
Lancaster, arrived there in 32 days frora
Liverpool, with the important news of ad
miral Duncan's engagement with and com
plete victory over the Dutch fleet from the
Texel, which happened about the 12th of
Odtoter.
In "this engagement admiral Duncan cap
tured eight Jhipt of the line, and "a lifty gun
fliip, among which were two admiral-hips.
The account states it to have been a fcvere
and bloody battle.
Admiral Duncan's fliip was> in a disabled
state, towed to, and anchored ofF, Dover,
tvith four feet water in her hold ; and, ayi,
and feme other veffcls were sent from the
Downs to pick up the disabled Ihips.
In consequence of the reception of thi*
news at Martinique, every armed vessel at
St. Piers, fired guns of rejoicing.
The news of this vidlory was ptiblifhed in
an Extra, paper the day the brig left Liver
pool ; one of which papers capt. R. saw at
Martinique.
This will, by many, be ealled Weft-India
news, and of course, diibelieved, but, from
tha veracity of the capt. and the positive
manner in which he states the above particu
lars, we cannot heiitate in declaring it to
be our opinion that it is well founded.
The njght before the brig ftom Liver
pool arrived at Martinique, flic fell in with
the F reach privateer Satis Pareil, from Gua
daloupe, jvith which flic had a severe en
gagementâthe captain former was
killed, and Several, hand# baofy wonndtd.
ARGUS ACCOUNT.
EXTRAORDINARY NEWS.
Leeked out on Saturday, a raoft impor
tant piece of intelligence if true, viz. that
the Dutch fleet, in the NortlrSeas, had met
the Entifc flset, and bft 'nine fliipi taken !
To render the ftÂ«ry mce probable, it is ad
ded, that the Britirtt Admiral Dunce's fliip
had' nine feet of water in her hold, that se
veral other of his fleet were much disabled,
and that afrejh fleet was Tent out ta tw
them In !
This plaufille account, it would seem, is
brougkt by a British armed brig which ar
rived at this port from Martinico on Tuef.
day, but never leeked out until Saturday af
ternoon, though it fell into good hands. It
is related as followsâTkat prior to the fail
ing of this said British armed vessel, a vessel
had arrived at Martinico with the above
account ill 32 days from Liverpool, that
great rejoicings were had at Martinico in
confequencc of it, and that he, himfelf, the
brave little Britiih armed vessel akovementi
onee, popped off many gang !
What renders this account extraordinary
in our view is, that by accounts from the
Texel to Oftober 1, we were informed,' that
in consequence of fern? difaffeaion in the
Dutch fleet, there was a disembarkation of
ma,ny thoufaeds, and no appearance of an
expedition.
