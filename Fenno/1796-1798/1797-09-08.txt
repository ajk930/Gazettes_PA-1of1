A DfivELdPEMENT OF THE CAUSES OT THE
DISTURBANCES BETWEEN THE AMERI
CAN AND TRENCH REPUBLICS.
ylddrefjed to the Ciltieu* of America.
MY FELLOW-CITIZENS,
IN the fncc?eding pafTages of the fame
letter, from Mr. Jefferfon to M. Mazzei,
we fee the fame opinion and misrepresentation
of the difference of sentiment between the
people and the government of America re
j peated, in still stronger terras ; and the fame
hint for the French to profit by that djver
fity of sentiment, held out in rsuah higher
colours, of the fame figurative kind for
which its author is so remarkable, than in
the parts just touched .upon.
" I fhonld give you a fever," eonvinues
thiÂ» celebrated letter-writer, " If I fluÂ»uld
name the apostates who have embraced these
hcrffies ; men who were Solomons in council '
and Sampsons in combat, but whose hair
has been cut o/fhy the whore of England."
Here is not only the fame declaration of
the division of our country, but a positive
averment that even those who had formerly
been diftin#uifhedfortheir wisdom andprow
efs in the defence of it, were now rendered
too weak and fufpefted by their attachment
to Great-Britain, to be feared by those who
choose to attack us. Who these Solomons
in council and Sampsons in combat were, is
too obvious to need an explanation. " They I
would wrest from uÂ»," however, it seems, 1
notwithstanding this Sampfonic diminution
of their ftrcngth, " that liberty which we
have obtained by so much labour and peril;
but we shall preserve it. Our mafi of weight
and r/ches is so powerful, that we have no
thing to fear from any attenpt again ft us
by force. It is fyfficient that we guard our
selves, and that we break the lilliputian ties
by which they have bound us, in the firft
slumbers which succeeded our labours.'''
Can it be imagined that these sentiments
ever flowed from the pen of an Ameriean ?
And yet, that they did, I have not the
smallest question now rayfelf ; and doubt not
but that I shall prove it to the fulleft fatie
fadlion of ?very one who will be at the trou
ble of reading these papers before I have
finilhed. It begins already to be admitted;
and the excuse prepared to be offered for
this ftrangS and unaccountable attachment
to France, at the expense of our own coun
try, is, the old'ftyry of the nevetvo-be fa
tisficd deht of gratitude to that nation. In
deed the lad sentence in the letter itfelf pro
nounces its own apology. " It fuffices,"
fays th; letter, " that we arrest the progrefj
of that system of ingratitude and injuflice to
wards France, from which,they would alien
ate us, to bring us under British influence."
It becomes necessary, in order to find
out how far this is a fufacieat apology for
such conduft, to make some short enquiry
into this fubjeft ; which is rendered the more
easy and contraÂ£tÂ«d by what has been alrea
dy said by others, whose arguments I fitall
endeavor to avoid as far as pofiible.
It has been rendered manifeft by public
documents from the French themselves* that
they never thought of rendering us any as
sistance at all, until they had supposed our
| independence was well established by
ourselves ; and in the conclusion of the war
it has been proved by the fame authority,
that the independence of America was not
theirobjeft when they rendered us that aflift
ance ; but that they endeavored, all in their
power, to thwart U9 in that desirable objeft.
And in the secret papers of Louis the XVI,
published by order of the convention after
his death, it appears from the of
that prince's two f counsellors, Turgot &
de Vergennes, that it was the policy of
that court, by rendering us afiiftance, there
by to prolong the war between Great-Britain
and this country, as far as it could, in or- j
der to exhaust and weaken both, with a view '
of reducing the resources of her antient and '
dreadful enemy, Great-Britain, both at home 1
and abroad, as low a3 possible. To this )
history of their motives in assisting us, I will I
add one other piece of testimony, which!
appears to have been overlooked, and which"
will not, it is presumed, be called in ques
tion by any American ; it is the testimony
of Dr. Franklin, one of our ministers cm
ployed in the whole of our negociations at
Paris, on the fnbjeÂ£ts of the revolution, our
independence, &c. That well remembered
lerican, in a letter to governor Pownall,J
a member of the British parliament, friendly
to America, declares, that one of the con
ditions required by France, as a confedera
tion for her entering into a treaty of alliance
with America, was, that we fhcnld become
tributary to them ; and, therefore, that all

ThiVwas still the fame fyjtem of Turcot
and "Vergennes,'of reducing and
refourcej of Great-Britain, improved, by an
attempt to draw a cpufiderable part of those
/powers and resources into their own hssds.
But I will not reft the discharge
debt of gratitude entirely oil tho motives which
induced France to enter inte an alliance with
us ; but will admit, that, let the motives
have been what they would, we are indebt
ed for all the real benefits which their aHi fi
ance afforded us ; and that, although France
might have conceived herfelf at the time of
entering into that alliance, that oyr inde
pendence was in a great measure fecuredby
our own exertions ; yet, it is a fait to be
acknowledged,that we were, long that,
reduced to a very critical and almost despe
rate point with refpedt to the real establish.
ment of that independence ; and, finally,
that her affiuanc?>at York-Town in Virgin
ia, aided very much in the completion-os our
revolution. Yet, I cannot agree, that a to
tal surrender of that independence, even if
they have bestoWed it on us, ought to be
made the return for those services. If we
are so much indebted ingratitude, that noth
ing but a surrender of the thing for which
we are thus indebted, can fatisfythe demand,
then is the obligation destroyed by the very
nature of the demand itfelf; there being no
confederation left on the part of America ;
; and it being a principle in all fair dealing,
that there is no real obligation where there
is no consideration. The vast ainount of
the debt being an acknowledgment of the
great value of the thing for which we are
thus indebted, is a fuffitient confeffion of it
elf, of the Vatl injury also, which wpuld be
done us by the payment which is demand
ed ; for, that a total surrender of our inde
, pendence, is the only return that would
fatisfy ow generous allies for the services they
have rendered, the wretched state of slavery
and beggery to which they have reduoed
the Dutch awl Belgians for similar services,
too loudly proclaims. These deluded peo
ple, particularly the Dutch, confiding in
their profefiions of friendfhip and good-will
for their welfare, fuffered, nay, invited them
to take poflefiion of their country, overturn
their government, pull down their dykes,
convert their fhijis to their own warlike
purposes, and destroy the independence of
their trade ; by which one of the most fru
gal and money-making people in Europe (
were reduced to nought ; and all for what ?
To give them an independent government in
return, of French chaofing, under which, they
had to fnbmit to the opprefllons of their ar
mies, and furnifh them with supplies of pro
vision* and actual money, by way of requi-
Jit 'wn, to the amount of at least fifty-five
millons of dollars : While the Belgians were
aftually put under military government, and
plundered of two hundred and fifty millions
of dollars ( under pretence of destroying the
clergy) and made to furnifh their armies
with provisions at the point of the bayonet;
and this too, all under the express -profef
fions of felting them free, and making them
independent and happy. What have we to
expedl from an entire fulÂ»miffion to their de
mands on the score of difchnrging our great
debt of gratitude, who, from their own ac
knowledgments through Turgot and Ver
gennes, were only aflilled with a view of
prolonging the war, to deflroy us and Great-
Britain together : Ana what are we indebt
ed, when the demand for that assistance actu
ally turns out to be that very deffruSio*
which they thus contemplated and dtlired
when the service was afforded.
Where there is an intention of doinggood,
there is no obligation due, even if that in
tention fails in its defrred end 5 but if we
are to be indebted for a favor done, where
there was no intention of doing any, then
certainly should we be released, when that,
which we considered a favor at ftrft, is at
tempted to be turned into an injury in the
end. Thug, although the motives for ren
dering a service have little or nothing to do
with the obligation due for that service, yet
the end to which that service goes, has
something to do with the obligation.'itfelf.
If, for instance, an individual renders me a
service, and just as that service is about to
have it j itiofl valuable effedt, that individual
steps in and claims all its benefits tohimfelf
to my utter ruinâwhere is the benefit to
me, where the great obligation I am wnder
to him ? To turn this familiar and plain
ftatc of the cafe, from private life, into the
great and important national dispute be
tween France and America, 1 will just make
a short statement of fime of the naoft im
portant points on which this great debt of
gratitude rests ; which I will illustrate with
a few examples as familiar and plain is the
political way.
France, it will be acknowledged, render
ed us eminent service at the siege of York ;
for which, whatever might have been her
motives or opinions refpefting the progress
we had made in the revolution towards our
independence when fhc entered into the al
liance, we are much indebted : but then,
it must be acknowledged too, that there was
another point of our revolution,prior to both
the siege of York and the alliance too, to
which great consideration Should be had, as
produftive, or at lcaft highly efTeutial, in
producing both these great events. Every
body remembers to what a low ebb we were
reduced in December 1776, and January
1777, long before the treaty ofalliance was
formed. The times of our soldiers expir-
every comfort, every neceflary
and every inducement wanting to intice
them to re-inlifl, America had to face at
least twenty thousand prime British troops,
with about two thousand five hundred uu
difciplined, worn out, naked and heartless
men, when that celebrated and never-to-be
forgotten turn was given to the war, t>y the
affairs of Trenton and Princeton,-which arc
to be considered as the two neighboring
Tlxrmopylas of America. Allowing tke
French every possible erf slit fortheir assistance
at York, without regard to their motives for
entering into the alliance, as I have already
done, what let me ask, would those services
have availed us in 1781, had we been-con
quered, at this critical period of the war,
in 1776 ?
' Prior to 'tfee battle of Trenton, which
mayjuftly be ftiled the pivot on which the
fate of the American revolution turned, the
French had fliewn no great decilion in our
favor , and never, till after the capture of
Burgoyne (which, however lowVe might
have been reduced after, until the decisive
blow at York, helped to lay the foundation
of that final success) was her friendfhip at
all aftive : In the firft ot these Memorable
events, which is justly to be considered a
kind of supernatural intervention in our fa
vor, at that awful and alarming crisis, we
can be at no loss id pointing out the great
and principal agent. In the latter, we have'
to form a melancholy chasm in the holy book
of gratitude, when we reflect that an Arnold
was a most important instrument ; for who
has ever thought of gratitude to him for
those services, which he afterwards attempt
ed to turn to such a wretched conclusion ?
And who can think with patience of grati
tude to France, when /he demands all, and
more no than we ever gained by her afjijlance
for the favor ? The moment (he assumed a
claimlikc this,(he abandoned the true ground
on which our gratitude was founded, and left
us more indebted to her, than (he herfelf is
to Dumourier for his passed services. It is
the end, not the beginning of aftions, which
eftablilhes their cbaradter ; and France her
felf, since she has become a republic, has
carried into aftual praS'ue this principle,
much farther than any other nation in'ths
universe.
-The Marquis de la Fayette, it is well
known, was amongst the firft in that coun
try who .put a hand to tire real work of re
volution. He was the firft to propose the
annihilation of titlesâthe firft aftual step
towards Republican ism and Equality âiu
which he made a<i eminent perfonaLfacrificc
l)imfelf ; for which Tic Tus been rewarded,
not indeed in this unbounded measure of
gratitude by France,-which she would have
America shew her, but with the
the chains (not indeed of the goddess of
Fcnch liberty for being her enemy) but in
those of neighbouring tvrants for being
theirs. And how ! by the accident of War
which takes from one party a servant, whose
detention and final deftruftion is of conse
quence to the success of the other ? No !
But by the hatred which those have for him,
who, considering and knowing him to be
the real foe to tyranny, have seized upon
the opportunity of his being abandoned by
those who pretended to be the Friends to li
berty (even when from that circumstance he
conld be of nÂ«Â»' service or injury to either) to
tormentJiim with impunity ?âAmericans !
here let the lips in silence be forever closed,
and the eye of gratitude Vrhich travels into
Europe in search ofbbje&S, be forever shut,
left it should return bathed in tears from the
loathforne priior,where this great and distin
guished friend ofAmerican liberty lies breath
ing his lalt for want of a single breath, or
heavenly respiration of real liberty, with re
proaches to the heart !
Whatever*caufe the French may have to
abandon him, America has hone, until he
attempts to turn those services which he has
undoubtedly rendered u ?,*o >ur injury; then,
and then only shall he be relieved from our
obligations to him ; <<nd then too ought we
to he released from our obligations to any
individual, or even nation of individuals.â
The I rnch- the mfelves, it is a fidt, have
carrried the praftice of this principle much
further than any bther nation ; for they
have not only withdrawn their gratitude
from those, who, after rendering them ser
vice, have endeavoured to turn that service
against them ; but it is well known, that
they have executed fcveral of their generals
who had rendered them splendid services,
for the want of a continued success even in
their battles. And by what other principle
have those advoccates for this unbounded
gratitude to France themfilves been govern
ed, who have been endeavouring so long to
alienate our affeftions from a certain merito
rious American, if it is not that that they
have conceited that he was about to turn the
influence of those eminent ferviees 'lie has
rendered against his country ? It is that in
fluence which individuals or nations either
obtain by their services that renders them
dangerous to those they have benefitted :
And upon that principle I will admit, that
if general Washington had at the end of the
late war, have written to a fubjeft of a pet
ty Duledom, bordering on, and subservient
to Great Britain, " that our political situa
tion was prodigiously changed ; thatinftead
of that noble love for liberty and republican
ism, an Anglo-monarchico-ari/locratic party
had arisen in short, that the " principal
body of our citizens', all our proprietors of
lands, and the mass of men of talents, were
opposed to our government," and that those

house of Mr. fefferfon, then the JJmcrican am
baffador âat which, after ar. able difcufjton of
several hours, the medium, viz. a limited mo
narchy, was decided on, as the degree to which
the revolution was to go, and whith degree all
parties pledged tbemfelves to each other to sup
port. 1 The Marquis was considered the head
of that party ; and who, having accepted the
command of the army, and taken an oath to sup
port the confiitution of a limited monarchy, thus ;
agreed upon at the aforefaid meeting, in which i
he bad aÃcd a eonfpicuous part and to which j
the King himfelf had confentcd, was only, afling
iii conformity with those sacred obligations and
agreements, when he was driven off. This '
was the taufe of their complaintiâthis the true '

NEW-YORK, September 7.
From the Aieoiii.
Capt. 8001, of the (loop Charlotte, ar
rived at this port yellerday from Cape Fran
cois, has politely handed us Cape Francois
papers (Bulletin OJiiria/ de St. T)om'n?uc)
to the 16th of Augud inclusive, by which
we learnâ
That the* French commillloners, at the
leeward, have put the molafTeÂ«, produced
on the farmed plantations in the colony of
St. Domingo, in requisition Â£tr public ser
vice ; one quarter which is dqe the farmers,
will be paid them at the rate of five livres
th? velt ; the other three quarters will be
accounted for at the fame price, oeduding
what they owe for cattle, utenlils and rents.
This aft is spoken of as advantageous to ,
both parties.
That, it having been reported the British
were about attacking Monte-Chrifte, it was |
decreed by desire of the Spanish president,
that the French take polfeflion of it and
Lsxavon, garriTon them, and copftitute
them a French colony.
That, the 10th of August was pom
pously celebrated at the Cape.
Capt. 800 l informs that all nations treat
'Americans with equal contempt.
The English pretend to proteH us by
their convoys ; but it seems this is in the
outward pafTage, after their will of us is
satiated ; and even this protection is but a
fnnre, for the convoys generally leave the
velfels on cruising ground of the French
privateers.
The French treat us as bad as they can ;
they want VlO further proof than JiritiJh
prote&ion, let these veflels proceed from
what port they may. Condemned or not
the cargoes are taken for government, and'
bills of 60, 90, or 120 days given in pay
ment.
Capt. 800 l has also favoured us with the
following remarks 011 board the Charlotte :
From the Charlotte's I.og-BÂ»nk.
The (loop Charlotte failed from Cape
Francois on the 20th of August, in com
pany with the brig Iphigenia, Thomson,
of New York, bound for Port-au-paix ;
brig Delaware, , hs>;nd to Phila
delphia, and brig Chance, Turner, for Bal
tirgore.
Left at the Cape, brig Hunter, Parker,
of New York ; fchr. Triton, Hilman, and
ââ, ditto, besides many oAer American
veflelsi
The brig Courier, of Philadelphia, with
her cargo, worth 32,000 dollars, bound to ,
a French port, is condemned at Gonaives, 1
on account that the owner was a French
emigrantâthey not allowing the right of 1
naturalization to emigrants lince the revo- f
lution. ,
The Frenth -continue their depredations 1
on our commerce to a greater degree than
ever. They now fend in oil veflels bound ,
wherever they might be, for examination.
The (loop Charlotte was taken in the har
bour of Monte Ckrifte, and sent down to '
the Cape for trial; and bad it not been for
having some articles on board for an Amer
ican merchant at the Cape, and a number of {
letters for different people, besides many
friends who interceded in her behalf, (he
would certainly have been condemned.
The (hip Hope, Burr ; and fchr. J
Campbell, both of New ork, were at Port- j
au-paixâthey were taken 011 'their way \
down from Monte Chrifte to the Cape, by I
a British frigate, their registers indorsed and
they ordered for the Mole. The captains :
broke their orders, and entered Port-au-
Paix.
Hie British (lop our veflels, indorse some f
Â«f their papers; convoy them as far as the 1
ea(t end of Tortuga, just in the track of I
tlie French privateers, and then leave them; I
by that means- the unfortunate Americans
fall a prey to tbem. Their papers being
indorsed by a British commander, is fafficient -
to condemn them, in a French port, altho' t
aftually boundto the port where theyreoeive
their sentence. j
On the 2d of September at 4 P. M. spoke
the brig Caroline, Ezekiel Robins, master,
from New York, bound to New Providence, I
all well. In lat. 36. 30Ion. 73, 30.
BOSTON, September 3.
Capt WoodbrMge, in a brig from Lisbon, e
has arrived at Marblehead, 45 days passage, ,
he dates, that Admiral Jervis had comminc- 1
cd the bombardment of Cadiz, ar.d the c
Spanish fleet lying in port, that he had [
potted his ships of war in such a situation, !
that they could throw (hells and red hot (hot 1
across the neck, among the fleet, and that
it wasexpefted he would eventuallydeltroy it.
Capt. W. also informs us that the mzr-
3 fce: for American pravjfians was very good)

This morning, between 9 apd 10 o'clopk,
; the following melancholy plage,
which, it is hoped, will operate as a caution
- hereafter. As some men on board a
1 ner off Bowly's wharf, were firing a fwivdj
which had been loaded several days, it burfl?
mto a numb-r of pieces, one of which (4 '
inches long and 2 broad), (truck a negro
man, called Phil], (who has been "for many
years a measurer on the wharves) took the
upper part of his gullet, under-jaw and part
of his upper-jaw entirely away, and left
him a breathless and ghastly monument of;
the uncertainty of life. Several pieces flew |
against the veflels and ware-houses ; aVid it
was a lingular intervention of Providence,
that no other person, not even the'one who
'fired the gun nor those Handing round, re
ceived the lead injury. There were many
people walking near the place, and necefla
rily a number of narrow escapes.
FREDERICK-TOWN, August 50.
From the RrGHTS of Man.
Captain Toplift, arrived at Boston, in
52 days from Bourdeaux, ftatcs, as faft,
that the French government has iJued or.
ders for Mr. Adet to return again for Ameri
ca, to resume hia functions [That captain
, Toplift reports what he heard, may be true
j âthat the Directory of France have chosen
another minister to reside in this country, lV
! probableâbut that monsieur Adet is the
man, I John Winter, Printer of this little
paper, do not believe. âThe President of
the United States will not receive him.
i Monsieur Adet hat been here once too
often.]
j A writer in the Boston Chronicle, dated
August 16, who signs himfelf' Tully,' ad
drefles a lengthy piece ' To John Adams,
Esq. President of the United States'âAfter
filling up a column of that paper with senti
ments bordering on abuse, he concludes his
address in the following lines :
E)* " But I will contend, and to my fel
low-citizens,it (hall be my duty hereafter to
demonstrate, th?.t the whole of your influ
ence, your abilities, such as they are,
(mark these four words reader) instead of
bring exerted to extenuate and remove* the
exiiting misfortunes and embarrassments of
our country, have been devoted to measures
whose tendency is to aggravate and increase
them."
Five different newspapers in the United
States havtflopped within the course of a few
weeks. The " dilatory conduct of a uura
ber of their distant customerÂ», in not pay
ing up, punctually, their fnbfcription-mo
ney," the Editors observe, is a reason fuf
ficient to juftify them from proceeding anv
further.
These printers, " whose want of money j
prevented them from from proceeding any ]
further," were all Jacobins.
I forefee the end of many others. These
things are pleasingâas they are (triking j

" Ihe abolition of Negro fiavery, which

State? of New Hamplhire, Marfachufetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Vermont,

the Western State of Kentucky, for several

is to take place on or before the ift of No

who communicates the intelligence, the li

feeing them ercdV villages, cultivate farms,
and form communities of civilised societies.
Before the person who gives this intelligence
left America, they have established a lodge
of Mafmiry ; and he had the fatisfaftion of
ieeing them, oa a grand day, jÂ»;rade to
church in all the of the order,

be somewhat exaggerated) extend to the

The following extraordinary account of
the very great power of diftention in the
Snake may be depended on as a faft. A
Snake of about fifteen feet long wag caught
by the Molungeesin an Aurung, four or five
miles distant from Contai, and having been
disabled by than, was dragged along with
a rope fattened nbont his neck.âThe Paunch
appeared "very much swelled, and upoa ex
amining it with a flick, all the parts of sortie
four footed animal were diftin&ly felt, which
was fuppofedto be a wild pig; but on rip
ping up the Snake, it Was fuuhd that he
had contrived to swallow a whale full grown
spotted Deer, aiyl that without breaking
or crushing any of its bones: the Deer mea
sured round the body two feet ten and a
half inches, and as he was by VlO means of
fenfive, must have been recently swallowed.
After the Deer was taken obt of his body
the Snake measured no more, round in the
largest part of his bodythan feventceninches, ;
and his. mouth only to appearance, four in
ches wide: wheiriie was brought in, he dis
covered only faint signs of life, however no
fponer was lie relieved of his load, than her i
revived, ere:Ud his head, and attempted to

_ French tad In.lia-:s, fcst out by the Count de Fronr

ptize, tVnt'out 2 hundred of theirbrifceft young
men, purs the French, fell upon tbeir
rear, killed great many of t' em, and took feve
rsl prisoners. In the mean time, the old nen, or
, Suchems hailejied to All.a iy, 10 console wjil) the
the EnglHh on this me'ancho'v occasion. Part of
their fpyecb wa< as follows.
Brethren,
" We came frpm pur wigwams with
tears in pur eyes, tp bemoan the bloodshed
at ScheneSady. The French, on this ocea
fion, have not a&ed like brave men, but
like thieres and robbers. What they have
done cannot be galled a viftory, but only a
farther proof that perfidy is in their hearts.
Be npt therefpre difepuraged. We give
you this belt to wipe away your tears.â"
Brethren,
/ " While we buVy your dead, basely mur
dered in cpld blppd at ScheneSctdy, we know
not what may have befallen our own people,
who are gypne in pursuit ps the enemy : the
fame thing that has happened tp ypu may
perhaps have happened to us; and alas!
they may be dead alfp !"
"â¢ Great-and sudden is the mifchief that
has fallen uppn ypu, as if it had fallen from
heaven upon ourselves. Qnr forefathers
taught us to go-with all ffeed, to lament
with our brethren, when any disaster or
I misfortune happens to those who are leagued
in the fame chain with us. Take this till
of vigilance, brethren, from us, that you
' may be more on your guard for the future.
We also give you Eye-water, that you may
I be more ftarp-fighted."
" We are now cpme to the house where
we were wont to renew the covenant-chain;
but, alas ! we find it pollutedâpolluted
with blood. All the five have heard
of the horrid deed, and we come to wipe a
vvay the blood, and make clean the heufev
So long as a man of us remains, we wilHiot
desist till we have crunk deep of revenge.â
We are of the race of the bear ; and a bear,
you know, never yields while one drop -of

CAUTION.
WHCREA.S a combination of men in tiife
cov.nty hive undertakeu to enrich them- '
ftlves,by ftbrieatisg titles to sundry valuable trails
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New 1
York, Philadelphia, and Paris, for which '
tra<sLs of It nd large sums of money have been paid
to those fraudulent nun, by innocent purchafcrs â 
It is therefore just that public information Ihotild
be given, to the end, that the injured may feekre
drefs while the fnen have property, and are to be
found. Those who hive been diicovered areTru-'
man Harrifon, Joseph Witeomb, fuid now to re-
Cde in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several otbcri who go under fiiSlitious names. It is
supposed that the lands offered fcr sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at least worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have aflual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. JI and 13, Otfego pMent,
thousand acres each, the aftual property of William
now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64.
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chanmoat, now of Paris, and James Averill
and others, oi u* State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
Charles Whartpn, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.â* The Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to camion the
public against purchasing those lands, as also to de
prive these men in future from impoGng on indivi
duafs, which their education and addrels have en
abled them to da heretofore. Witeomb hat been
a (hopkeeper of some note in this country.
The following affi<}avits will fct in a clear point
of view the wickedneft of those men, which when
the public have perilled, will induce them to ex
tnfe the interference us Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 28th, 1797.
1 Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfejo, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witeomb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for iot No. 58, Otfego patent, which

that the several claims be so Rated, and support

the neceflityof obtaining further iulormation, or ad

the general agent thinks it his duly to add, (for the
