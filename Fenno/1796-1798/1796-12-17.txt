Ths PAINS OF MEMORY.
. From Mr. Merry's Poem.
j. As the proml veflel o'er the ocean glides,
Is And seems to scorn the winds and mock the tides,
le The jocund Mariners expand the fail,
a- To seize the vigour of the viewltfs gale:
5- From the high Ihronds their caroll d ditties raise,
y, To many a favorite maid, the notes of praise !
But now Aiore sullen blows the perilous blast,
Unsparing tempests work the struggling mall:
:e A moment lullsâand from the treacherous patife
I, Frelh horror gains, and fiercer fury draws !
1 n vain the pilot fliuns the o'er whelming wave,
Useless the cautionâfor no (kill can save !
The timbers crack, the ruddder quits its hold,
At random here and there the (b'p is roll'd.
Then comes the field of mem'ry tq dispense
Among the crew affliction's keener sense :
Dwells on each tender tie they left behind,
Grapples the foul, and preys upon the nun J!

Hint to Religious Men.
LEAVE sff that prayer for French fuctttfs.
That a wile governor continues it in his proclama
tions, exciife for y6u. He has ends to an- '
fwer which you have not ; and besides can take lacl \
or erase upon after calculation. To pray for French !
success is praying for the misery of Europe; and '
the corruption, moral anil political, of your ovrn 1
country. These evils proceed exaÂ£l!y in the ratio '
of that success ; and are as naturally the effcdls of '
it, as ravings are of the bite of a mad dog;.
Give up also your deluflon about the Millenium. '
It did not commence with the " regeneration" of J
n France. Nor can it be made of an " age of rea- 1
son."âThis certainly is a peribd in which Satan t
was to be loojed, not bound.âWhen Paine pro- '
claimed his " rights of man," the kingdom nf Sa J
tan was at hand But when weÂ»ks were tnrned in
to decades ; deep eternal inferibed on the tombs ; 1
and a naked girl, for adoration, was placed on the '
altar ; then it was come. And the sonÂ« of Belial 1
r - far *nd near, thpugh you did not underfiand rhem,
c scouted for joy !âFrom that time France has been
ie drunk -with whoredoms, and the blood tf the /lain. We 1
too have been made to drink of h|i- blnfjbemies ; ]
ie and mult for a season, drink of ber plague: The 1
Jews, you fee, are not callcd to Chriltianity 1 but
,c Deijls 1 o Athe'-.fvi. Ours are nearly: all in.âlDrean '
71 not then of being in the Millenium, or its dawn. '

Mr. Fenno, t
I HAVE had it ii contemplation since I saw '
Mis. Meiry in tha character of Juliet, to my r
sentiments ef her theatiical talents, but a diffidence '
t- naturally ari/ing in those, who have ntrvtrt giwn (
their thoughts on any fubjeft to the public, has
prevented the execution of my design until now. t
The dramatic fame of Mis. Mfrry was not eonfined J
' to Europe, but had reached the (hotes of Am?ri- f
ca, long before her arrival in this citj. When her '
r appearance was firft announced here, in a character >
that required no iefs nicety nf judgment, fully to *
comprehend, than abilities fuccefsfully to execute : z
I, it was justly to be expe&ed, that thefrieno* of the a
drama would be witnesses to her merit, and-yield c
their approbation to the palm of excellence, flie 1
had received in Europe. With this mutive, I St- r
tended the Theatre, and to fay that I was pleased r
with her performance would be doing injtiftice to 1
J my fceling6, aod faintly conveytlie ideas that were a
excited in my mind by the bBRe of talents, that t
obfeured the eye of the. eiitic, and captivated the t
fenfesof the fpeftatorg : whenever (lie expreQesthe c
various feelings which agitate the bosom of the in- t
r terefting Juliet, every foul is tremblingly alive, and S
vibrates in uiiifon with every paflion (he rcprefents. t
Her powers seem peculiarly fitted for this tharac- a
ter ; the melodious flexibility of voice, cliaftity and c
gracefulnefs of action, and propriety of dflivcrv, a
all conspire to astonish and delight us. If Shake- (!
fpeare InmMf could have beheld the darling- of his I
fancy perforated by Mrs, Merry, delufioj miolit p
have overcame his ienfes by the momentary belief 1
that he saw the reality of thof. fce.es, and the i<
force of that paffioa, which his imagination has so b
elegantly drawn. In representing charters, where U
ove, tendernels p.ty, with the reft of tho amiabU .
train of our affedion. are alternately predominant, ,1
Mr. Merry is unrivalled. I will venture ,0 assert 0
the opinion, that pet formers teprtfenc with more

Thk ANSWER.
[â Concluded frÂ«m yeflerday's Gazette.]
The French nation will not persist in asserting.
that becatffe the exercise of rights which (he has
claimed as legitimate on former occasions, become!
inconvenient when exercifcd by others, she may
therefore refufe to acknowledge and refpeft them.
This would be the language of an haughty despot,
in a conquered country, not of justice, honor, and :
good faith from one friend to another.
It is said that the 18th article of the treaty with
Great-Britain, suspends all the commercial rela
tions between the United States and France, by
preventing the fapplics looked for by France from
this country.
This article has not introduced any new cafe, in
which provisions may be contraband : It only alters
the eonfequence resulting from a seizure of them, i
when they are so. Valin (i vo], 264) fays, "By
our law, and the law of nation*, provifians are not
prohibited, except to plates befnged or blockaded." j
The article eomplaincd of, fays explicitly, that |
whep provisions and other articles not generality con- t
traland are become so, according to the exijiing law ,
of nations, and (hall, for that rtafan, he seized, they ,
(hall not be conflfcatcd, but the owners (hall be <â 
" Si completely indemnified, and reccive"btfi;les a rear
a . fonable mercantile profit. This principle operated ,
as an encouragement for American vefTels to feck v
.j, the French markets, by insuring theft agair.lk iols,
h , if they happened in any instance t , Â«be interrupted t
l( j in the voyageâFrance, I presume, f
n our vessels bound with provisions to a place besieged f
â or blockadaded, liable to ftizufe, after due notice n
jf of the fail ; if, instead of this, they contend for t
the privilege of paying for them according 'to the c
terms of the treaty with Great-Britain, 1 suppose h
,f it will Hot ( be denied to t/iem. But if, under pre- h
fence that aveffel is bound to a besieged or blockaded t
n part, wheÃ (he is not, either France or Great a
Britain should seize or detain her, it is an injury n
, not authorized by the treaty, or the law or|wtionÂ». ti
! This is what both nafi(Jbj have done, when, their j|
. inteiefts and necefiities required itâsometimes with v
e and often without any apologyâand what they ti
will often continue to do, [fear, as long as they 0
)( know we cannot ptinifh them for it. B
n Thcfe injuries are said to have been received while \
e every object around reminds us of thetyrandiof d
. Britain, atid the generous aiTtftance of France, dur- c
e iDg ihe American war.
it The generosity -of France and the ingratitude of tl
n the United States have been often suggested by r
some of our own citisens, and we are now fte- tl
lC prcached with it by France herfelf. Gratitude is 0
r _ due for favors received ; and this virtue may exist h
s _ among nations as well as among individuals: but w
lt the tnjtive of the benefit mud be solely the advan- so
n f a Â£ e "f party 0 Â« whom it was conferred, else a !
it ceases to be a favor. There is positive proof that r j
I' ranee did sot enter into the alliance with us in yv
f* r our edmantage; but for her mvn. The S
whoiccourfe of the neg'ociation, as well as a poll- h
tivc knowledge of the, fact, proves this. She re. C i
w fitted ail our folicitatiens for effe&ual afliftance for V ;
y near three years; and rose in her demands during si
c the campaign of 1777, wlien our affairs presented p
n raoft-tfrratcfling afjJefit." " " 7" "i

m, Continuation of tht delate on the Met, in an r w , r
3y to the Prtjident's speech.
-Â»r fâ¢â¢ s rrt u,d thcrc fccrned <Â° Â»* w
â¢ fads which a 1 were agreed, and some in which
Â« there wÂ« a flriking difference of opinion. Geu

â¢ re pea for the Pr.Sdent, but to disagree as tifwhat
y related to companLns betwixt the Ctuatiun of th : Â»
country and that of foreign nation,. Whatever
â a- may be our feeling,, said he, with refp ft to other
C , nations it is as .veil to keep them to ourlelves. If
'* we are more happy than other* it ii well for ut -
but it would be better to leave it to other n.tioai
to dtfeover our t'uperior enjoyments, and notour*
" W ve ' m Â» ke Â» boast of them. It was probable, he
laid, that those nations which we comtniferateo,
ce might think themselves as happj at we, If gen'
Â»r tie men referred to the fpeeclws of the Btitifh Chan.
,e cdlor of the Exchecquer, it would be fuuud that
le he painted that country as the moil flourifhing and
hippy on the face of the globe. The French na
tion alio congratulated themselves with being a free
1 and enlightened country, and yet these were the
/ nations which were looked upon as a proper con- 1
*â¢ tract to our fopcriority. Much lÂ«ad been said of
â¢r this prosperity, and the commercial derangements
h which had taken place to foch an unexampled ex
-7 tent had by one gentleman been -very highly spoken
7 of, and by another compared to fpees 011 the fun,
and foch as jouglic nut to have been mentioned.
r Was this tbe way in which to speak of the piefent
diftrefles of commerce ; when our vessels inliead of
r * coming fafely into harbour were taken and carried
into Halifax, Cape Francoife, Cunaives, and 0-
ther ports ? This was a situation in which geatle
-7 men who spoke so lightly of it, wonlj not like
f- themselves to be placed. All these evils had their
origin in the present war, from which this country
I had by no means been exempted. Indeed, whilst
II we had been thus fufTering, France, he said, had
been colle&ing gold and silver and the moil valu
es ablc\ productions of the arts and fciencrt from va
!t rieus parts of Europe. Yet this is a nation over
" which we are fheddirig tsars. We cannot, said Mr.
*. Swanwick, fend a ship to sea, with any hope of
Â»- her arriving at tl* port to which she is bound. In
conftquence of this, the rates of infncance are ad
"â  variced to double their usual price. If the public
g funds were looked to, they would b<e found falling.
Agriculture it_vvai_tmc, was fluujnlung; luit this
was all that could be said. This, he observed, wal
'â  not the time for drawing the contrail now made.
'Â» What, he asked would be the probable efft& efdb
'> ting so ? Envy, he said, was created by good foe*
tune ; no one envied the poor. Shall we, said he,
d invite new depredations upon our commerce by
it- such reprcfentations of prosperity ? He did not
s think this exaltation of ourselves above other iia
>e tions was a fit fobjeft for this address. Wt might,
h he said, express our own fatisfa&ion with the stare â¢
e of our affairs without depreciating that of other na
-- tions. Our calling ourtelves the most free and en
Â»- lightened natien in the world, would not be well
n received by other nations, and could have no other
1- 1 effect than to create rivals. He wished the addrefa
h I to be re-committed in order that it miVht be made
1 '
d | more acceptable to all parts of the house. Whillk
ir 1 every one was calling out agsiinft foreign influnncc
d i ;yÂ® were every day fuffering from foreignersâMr.
e ! Swanwick referred to the treatment of capt. Jtffup,
It and to the unproteftcd (late of our seamen, and atÂ»
d j tributed all the depredation* and injuries sustained
d by our shipping and commerce to be owing to our
it ' having no means of defending ourselves. The Prc
c tide t, he said, I:.V mentioned several thing* in ins
h Speech which did not indicate our prosperity ; 2-
ir mang other things he had hinted that a navy wis
- neceflary to our defence. Let us, therefore, said
M be moderate and fatisfied wirh our own fittMli
â  f on, but avoid rcfleiVing apon others.
