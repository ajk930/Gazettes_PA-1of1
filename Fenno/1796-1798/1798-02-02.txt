dot only to point out in easy and engaging lan

t f Mr. Nicholas's Speech frÂ«nt yrfierJay'j
j Gazette.)
] He said he was sorry to fee under tlic neeffity
of replying tÂ» lame reflexions which had bee:;
caff upbn oUrlate minister io France. Gentle
men had not Uated that business (airly. It was
neeeflary at the time that this gentleman wa*
lent ti> France, to fend i nianofhis political chi
caner. This conduct was forced upon the exe
cutive. He believed an offer of the embafly
was made to one gentleman who refilled it, al
igning far a rcafon to his fiicnds, that he was
convinced, that whoever accepted of the office,
muff be made a facrilijce of,'as he would he re
called whenever the situation of things fljould
be such as to allow of-it. He w*s fon-y, when
' our late minister to France hats laid before the
public Â»il the offic al documents w'hich lad
ed betwixt him and the two governments, that
t'critlemen should think it neecefiary to make in
t finuations against him. The public, who was
in poffeffit/ii OfTiis bt><,k, WtitiM how'evcT judge
. for themselves. But !f a decliraiioh was to be
mide on (Uis hÂ« declared it as his opin
t ion, that peace with the French republic mighft
have been ferured, but that the executive hail
) wantonly cast it from us. With rtfpefi to iii
finuations w'hich had been thrown wut against
â¢ the private charaifleV of that gentlemen, he
i (hould not notice then! ; but if any ihartje
: should be brought against him, let it be public
ly made, arid he had no doubt it would be an
fuer.d.
He would not have detained the committee
longer, Mr. N. said, but i' he did sot lay before
them some additional observations, they would
not be in full of his sentiments on this
fubjeiS. If he could (hew that there existed a
, description of persons in this ecuntry attached
by interest to the executive, who formed a kind
of a ftandingarmy more powe'rful than if thty
had guns in their hands, by being spread over
the community, it wculd afford one of the
strongest reasons for guarding against executive
patronage. He should, therefore, make a few
remarks on the origin of party in this country.
In speaking of the public debt, he trulted it
w6uld not be thought that he had any intention
offhaking its credit. He had been five years
in Cengrefs, and never done any thing which
had this tendency ; but he miift speak of the
creation of that debt. And when the political
rharadter of the fifcal operator was cocfidered,
it was probable that the scheme was intended
to produce a party in the United States who
would support the executive at all events. â
For this purpose all government paper waÂ»fund
ed at its nominal value ; and this was done fa __
that it CQuld be purchafcd up for a mere trifle,
before, the people could hear of the provision, so
that the class of mtu referred to, in a moment
made immense fortunes. The natural influence
of their magic fortunes was to attach them to
the perfbns who hsd created Aem, and to pro
duce a desire for (hose political inftuutiont,
which in other conntries, had been found most
fuccefsful in securing that kind of property.â
What was the effe.fl ? Scarcely one among the
fuccefsful speculators was to be feund, who did
not range himfeif on the fide of the executive,
and who did not become the advocate of the
strongest executive p6wer.
The influence of thofefpeculations in produc
ing a scries of othes, down to the present time,
is well known : we are every day experiencing
their effefls in the morals and happiness Â»f the
country ; their influericÂ» on the politics of the
country is no less discoverable, for vtrv few are
the instances, where men have been drawn info
the pr*.Â£lice of fpeeuUtion, in which it will not
be found that they are equally the disciples of
the politics of their infirudlors, and of their arts
of making money.
Another class of men had been conneiSed with
the executive by the force of opinion and parti
cular circumstances from whom it derived great'
llrength ; he meant the perfonsjwho Lad been
d faffe&ed to our revolution. These men, gen
erally, felt a leaning-to this government, on ac
count of their dislike oftheold.and on account
of itsapproachtothcirfavorite modelâhedidnot
mean to blame them for that, but merely to
trice the connexion. He himfeif had been the
firm friend-of the constitution, and would
vote for it again if it was in question. At the
dawn of our disputes with France, most ef these
1 erfons were attached to the executive by their
sympathy in the apparent animoflty towards
her, and in the progress of it, the conformity of
sentiment has been ftrengthsned, and thev Itand
among the foremoft of the patriots ef the pre
ftnt day.
He jiad mensioned these two classes of persons
far the reasons before assigned, and becaufc we
were entertained very| much about American
sentiment ar,d American character. It was not
to be doubted, that they myft have had great
influence in forming what they had so much in
fluence in supporting, and he believed it would
be fufficierit to examine its origin, to juflify gen
tlemen from the censure of riot partaking in it.
He had mentioned them for another reafori ;
aryi that was, that men, who were not ifhamed
of their political aflociates, difesvered great re*
pugnance to all perlens among their opponents,
who were even born in another country. So
far as it refpetfs a particular gentleman in that

met with the contempt which every honest man
would feel, when they were pointed at him ;
he was also sure, that candid and enlightened
men would consider them as acknowledgments
of a fuperierity which waserery day evinced;
but he did not know but that they might ope
rate differently on part of the community, and
therefore he thought it necessary to notice them.
Let it be teld,tu the public, that he has resided in
this country nineteen years ; that he came to it

nineteen, and that all his habits have been form

acquired independence, and that he has fennel

fay, too, that he was born in a country whsrt
liberty was well understood, and where, at the
fane time, the utmost order m*vailed ; and
that in his own time, his countrfexhibited the

The committee rose, and had leave to fit ifesm.
Adjourned.
Tx 1 day, Jjnuary Â«6
'The house having again resolved iifelf into
a committee of the whole, on the bill pro
viding the means of Foreign intereourfe,
and Mr. Nicholas's amendment being un
der consideration.
Mr. Goodrich obferred, that in support ef
thÂ» motion, the competency of the house to fix
our diplomatic intercourse, in refpeft to the
number, and grade of our aainifters, was aflcrt
ed, as well as the policy of the particular ar
rapgcineht contemplatecTby the amendment.
On the firft of these queflions he would make
but a few remarka. It required a clsfenefs of
reasoning tedious in debate, and a pracifion of
exprelCon difficult to attain ; it was coo a theo
ry upon which gentlemen formed their opinion,
father from the general cast of political senti
ment with which they had been accuÃomet! to
vien the executive pawer, than from fair invelti
gation and argument. The claim was deduce 1
from these fouÂ«es, the power the house hid of
creating offices, frotn the exercise of its power in
appropriating money, aad fixing lalaries.
With refpe.t to the firft, the office of foreign
ahimfter was created by the constitution itfelf,
and the appointment was confided to the presi
dent and fen ate, and if he was nofmuch
fiktn, when the memorable queftioo of appro
priajion was formerly utideroi cuffion, itwas not
pretended thitthe house had any powÂ«r to inter
fere direflly or indirefllyinr-fpei-'ltothe inftitut
jng.ir Ptanaj.'i'.ir foreign negociStionÂ»,orconduiS
ii.g our external relation-!. Such right was then
difciai-ned. The powaVoÃ thepart ofthe house
tn inflnute theoffice of minister, had been only
jio-v cufforily glanced at, without being much
infilled cn.
Jt wou'.d Botcfcipe the a:tÂ«ntion ofthe com
initice, that the right of receiving and accredits
ing foreign ministers was veiled solely in the
president. This right was so intimately blended
with that of appointing and fending ministers a
broad, that in pi;aflice they could not be well
For their due exercise bdth mull
in hands. It was a principle
known to be eflaSifhed among nations at the
adoprion of thÂ» constitution, that ministers of a
Correspondent grade should be sent from each
refpe<3ive nation, flow is this rule to be ob
ferv ed, if thelioufe has in any way directly-or
a power, to fix our diplomatic eflah
(i&ment, as to the rank of our ministers. N6
mode seems to haare been contemplated by which
the executive and the legislature are to afl in un -
son. And oftes it may so happen that the in
Â»er*fts of onr country, its peace and fccur,ity may
depend 011 a more prompt determination, than
is confident with the recess of the legislature or
its 'ieliberative forms- These considerations, if
any additional onetr are necessary, confirm the
d*d)rine of the power of appointing and fending
foreign ministers being exclusively veiled in the
president, vvith the advice and confcnt of the fe
Â»Â«e.
The rig't of determining on the number and
grade of mjnifiers by means of the power of
withholding appropriations is urged. Here all
that could be said had already been often re
peated, and if it had not been f e!t by the moral
finfe, there was little hope from arguments ad
drÂ«fl'ed to the und*rllandiÂ«g. The president as
the executive agent of our nation was authorised
with the confcnt of the fenateto appoint minis
ters. The appointment and service created a
debt againit the United States, which as there
prefentatives of the states they were under a mo
ral obligation to acknowledge and pay. In pri
va'e life, if an individual employed another in
his service, or his authorised agent so employed
him, the debt incurred could not honestly be de
nied, or psyment avoided. The tribunils of
justice we inftitvte tyiforte it as a debt ; good
faith and jnftice demand of us to pay for fervic
es.conllitutionaHy contracted for, and our con
ferences, he trufled, would always prove afuffi
cient tribunal to induce a fulfillment of the ob
ligations of good faith and juftic.
But it was said, if the end could not be attain
ed by refufinir an appropriation, it could cer
tainly be effected by the power of the ho%fe to
t-.x salaries. No oae denied the right of the
house, with a vitn to certainty and economy, to
Â£x the lalaries of diplomatic agents. But on
what principle were these salaries to be fixed.
If on any other, except those of equitable and
honorable reward, it would be dirty ceconnmyâ
it would bs descending to do, by chicanery and
uibterluge, what the house could not effect in a
ny other way, and which would he doing what
the constitution netrr could have intended. He
ftould however dismiss this fubjefl, and the
note cbearfully, as there were ether grounds up
on which the quefiion might be placed that
would not meet with so decided a predeteripi
natien in the minds of many gÂ«ntlei*en.
Jt mufl have occarrcd to every member of the
committee, that the bill was limitsd te two years
iji its duration. The nature of the amendment
was Â» limitation upsn a limitation, as avowed by
the mover, by curtailing alter one year a part of
our diplomatic intercourse. Was this done on the
ground of faring expense f This was disavowed,
as it was seen to befa matter of small moment.
Indeed it was dsubtful with hiin, whether any
thing would be fared, or not, as ic was certain
\ tfest aur ministers plenipotentiary would lot ac
cept the ofKcet of mfaifters reSdent with half their
present salary ; of caurfe new appsintmenrs must
r< rnide, and the expeo'e of frefh oÂ«Hct> incurr
ed. Mr. 9. also complained, on the Came ground
ai before Oated, ef the injultice of recalling our
prefrnt miniftt rs. He also thought it bad policy ;
as where a government like ours wanted all the
virtae and talents of its citizens for public office*,
it would be found difficult to obtain them if so
m irii Ujici.i'ainty was given tn the duration of
eff.ccr, which had all the appearance of j>troia
nency. It would aw-ange our affair* a- f
broad, om!:arrafs thehAfinefsof the executive, and r
wantonly interfere with the viaws of that depart- j
meat which it might mar and 11 y praltrave.
Some gentlemen had imagined, that these miu- '
iilers -were unneteflary at the courts to which they I
were font. la answer to thii, he should alledge, ]
the house did not information fufficent to
determine this point, apd it might be uafafe to be
communicated to them. But was there no reason
for having a mnulttr plenipotentiary at Spain ? '
No gentleman would fay so. was therano !
reafou for such an agent at Lithon ? Was not this
the center of communication with ti our
affairs with the Barbary powers. Uut w:iat fer
yice it was afced, could a minister at Hrrlin ren
der to this country ? \i a time when the affairs of
Europe are ditlurbed as at present, when our Ctu
ation with France is such that uo minittcr of ours
will be received in ihat country, rtafonsof a very
important nature may fugged themf.lves, why an
able and faithful mimlter (hould be placed at the
court of Prullia. Arguments of a more general
nature were introduced in favor,of the amendment.
It wab said to be the filtered of this coun
try to annul all our Foreign Political Inter
course. They might, he said", (peculate up
on this fubjÂ«A ; but they had not the pow
â¢er to decide upon it; for Political Iwter
! cuurfe did not depend upon our fending Mi
nisters abroad. It m'ght be carried 011 by
i Foreign Ministers sent here ; and the confti
-1 tution (as he had before dated) (hewed they
could not prevent this, as it expressly made
it the duty of the Pieddent to receive Fo
reign Ministers ; and, in this cafe, there
would be no call upon the house for the e
ftablilhment and support of Ministers, as
they would be supported by their own coun
' try ; and though it was true, that Foreign
1 Ministers were not usually sent to a country
' without a return of men of the fame grade
, to the country from which thev were sent,
yet he introduced this position, to (hew that
it was not in the power of the house to fay
whether this country (hould have Foreign
political Intercourse, or not.
But if the committee mult speculate upon
this queltion, there were other confiderati
oas which would lead them to a doubt that
it would be proper to abandon all Fofeign
Political Intercourse. It was a sentiment
advocated by the gentleman from Pennfyl
, varna, that we ought to have no political Fo
â  reign relations. That gentleman prided
himlelf in being of peculiar sentiments, but
on this occalion he was not so It had long
1 been the sentiment of this country. It was
a sentiment introduced into all our treaties
( but one, and it would be found in the fare
. well address of the late President of the U
nited States. Mr. G. presumed therefore,
â  when our diplomatic intercourse was eftab
c lilhcd by the late President (and he eftablilh
ed it as it is) he felt the force of this senti
ment as strongly as the gentleman from Penn
, fylvania But though the gentleman from
> S. Carolina (Mr. Pinckney) who had him
r j felf been employed abroad, had given it as
1 his opinion that this country would be bet
ter without miiiifters abroad, yet, though
he acknowledged the weight of this autho-
J rity, when he found the late President, who
j bad the best opportunity of forming ajudg
- ipeiit upon the fubjeft, from sage experi
ence, had appointed thefeminifters, he was
' led to doubt though he was fenCbie foroe e
e vils had arisen from foreign ministers redding
a in this country, as well as from fomt of our
j ministers abroad, whether they might not
. be too hasty in deciding upon this national
r queflion. Admitting that it was not for
- the interest of this country to have any fo
-5 reign political relations, he a(ked gentleman
1 what they Hleant by this? They (null mean
that fort of compaÂ£l with foreign nations,
y which was called a Treaty of Alliance de
i fenfive and offenGve. With a foreign rela
r tion of this kind we had nothing to do,and
f he hoped never (hould have. Butwhatcon
c neftlon was there between this fubjett and
the present amendment? Because we deter
mined to have no political relation with fo
reign countries, were we to have no politi
i cal ageÃts? Surely we ought, since they
f may be the means of preventing the necessity
' of these political foreign relations.
But before it w is determined whetker it
would be proper to have anypolitical foreign
s intercourse, he would enquire what was the
1 effedt produced by foreign ministers in our
'- country, and by ours when abroad. He
Â» acknowledged that produced by ministers
" sent to this country was not a very agreea
ble one ; it was not such an one as to encou
, rage us, or to flatter us. But from what
j cause had this arifan ; it arose out of the
- (late of the times ; from the situation of
f public sentiment in this country? If any
thing could leave a doubt on this fubjedl, it
would be'the effeft of the diplomatic agents
| in this country. He had doubted whether
_ it was expedient to admit them; for though
these public agents ought only to have cor
- responded with the President of the United
- States; yet, when they were thwarted in
5 their views, they had made their
e appeals to the people. Nor would he ex
cept the ministers of the two great Europe
an rival powers ; the condutt of all had been
1 far different from what it ought to have been
- and inftcad of supporting the dignified cha
i rafter of diplomatic agents, aflerting the in
terests of their own country, and conciliat
j ing the favor and affeftion of ours, they
e hate departed from this line of conduft, aud
observing the existence of two parties in this
it country, they have endeavoured to operate
i- upon the people. But it was true we had
no reason to objedl to foreign ministers on
e this ground as the good sense of the people
t had uniformly refilled their address, and all
y their proje&s had been fruftrated.
'f But what effects, he alked, had our agents
Â® | produced abroad? Undoubtedly their in
'' ftruCtions have uniformly been to represent
y to foreign countries the interests and views
i of our own. And was it not to be fttppof
- ed, that persons going from this country,
to foreign countries, would feel an attach
ment to their own, and that, they would
d make the mod of its interests? Calculating
r from what we know of human nature, this
; nuift be the cafe. It was tree, a minister
e might conduct himfelf so as to injnre, instead
J of serving the country by which he was eu>-
/ ployed. He might raifeexpeftatiuns whick
- his country could never gratify. He might
propoÂ£e to afford a Foreign nation such a ( I:
succour as his country coi.lil not supply. h
If this wefe to be dont, it would be regrett- j
ed ; but" becatife an inititution might pofli- g
bly be abused, it was no argument for its ( t
bting annihilated. j t
Suppose, said he, opr foreign intercourse , 1
were to be broken up, what would be the t
cÂ®iifequencc? We mull, then, when we >
have any business to fettle with a foreign na- i
turn, employ envoys extraordinary, which j
would be employing men of a higher grade 1
of charaftcr, and if public ministers were i
to be considered as full of mifebitf, it might <
be attended with greater evils than the grade i
we now employ. But it was said the bufi- !
ness of the country with foreign nations
might be managed by consuls; but, as had
been observed, these charafterÃ were not ad
mitted at foreign courts, if they were in o
ther refpefts fit for the bofinefs, which he
did nor believe they were. Besides, if no
accredited agents were employed betwixt fo
reign nations, spies andemiflaries would take
theirplace; asgovernment3 would be inform
ed, in one way or other, of what was going
on in every country with which they had a
ny connexion.
And if a resolution was taken in this
country to have no diplomatic agents abroad
in what situation would the executive of this
country be placed? He is entrusted with
the foreign relations of the country, but he
would have no foreign minister. He mull,
therefore defcendto thefame low means with
Other nations, and depend upon spies for in
formation; and when he got this informa
tion it would not be from authority, and
therefore such as he could not communicate
to the legislature. Gentlemen, he fuppof
l ed, would not be willing to put the business
upon this footing. He acknowledged that
the employment of foreign miuifters was at
tended with some inconveinence; but it was
seen there were evils on both fides, and it
was for government tp balance between
them.'
But it was apprehended, these ministers
would join the political parties of the coun
tries to which they were sent. On the con
trary, he should suppose they would carry
with them the feelings of their own conn
try and communicate them ; but if this
were to he dreaded, Would it not be mofl
likely to happen in the two countries that
were excepted from this amendment ? For !
where, he asked, were the points on which
the great affairs of the nations of Europe
turn, but in London and Paris ? If there
were danger of this kind, it must, there
fore, be at those places.
Bat it was said that wars were generally
produced by foreign ministers. That this
may have been the cafe, in some instances,
he did not doubt ; but speaking in general,
it was attributing too great effefts to too
trifling causes. The causes of war, he said,
were in.the passions and animosities of na
tions. Our own country had been agitated
in a manner which could scarcely have been
imagined, from its remote situation. by its
partiality for one nation and its enmity to
another. When Contemplating this fubjuft
therefore, the committee ought not too haf
t tily to decide. The intention of foreign
1 intercourse was to promote peace and amity
r âit had long been the "praftice of the civil
. ized world. If some of our minifies had
! caught the passions of the country to which
, they were sent, and we had not been whol
t ly able to avert the storm which seems to
. threaten usâa storm which appears to be
. bearing away all the aneient land-marks of
1 the earth, yet, he believed, upon the
. whole, that our foreign ministers had done
I great and permanent good to this country.
Instead of bringing forward a fubjeft of
this kind at this time, the legislature ought
. to be united in support of the executive of
f the country ; for from whatever eaufe oar
f misfortunes arise, whether from our own
mifconduft, or the tinreafonable dominatiftn
t of a foreign power, they did not originate
t under the present administration, and there
â¢ fore, the difficult situation in which tjnr
r chief magistrate was placed, required all
: the support which the legislature couldgive
s him. If the geatleman who moved this a
- mendment, had, however, introduced it
- unaccompanied with the refieftions which
t he had made ufa of, it might have been a
: fubjeft well worthy of consideration. This
f he had not thought proper to do. Topics
j of a lingular nature had been brought for
t ward. It had been said, that all republi
s can governments had a tendency towards
r despotic power ; that the power of appoint
i ment to office placed in the President had
- been basely prollituted ; that the doftrine
1 of favoritifm had been introduced, and per
l sons of a particular charafter were only ap
r pointed to office, aud that this determina
- tion was likely to produce, or had produ
ced, dangerous operations on the talents
i and abilities of the .'egiflature. When char
l gesof so serious a nature were/brought for
- ward,, it became necessary to repel them.
- He was sensible the fubjeft was painful.
- The weapons of felf-juftification of govern
( ment, became, 'in some measure, weapons
1 of attack, and few had the judgment to
s use them rightly If the charges were
: true, what were the constituted authorities
1 of the country ? The accusation impeach
i es the purity of the executive, the purity
: of the house of representatives, and lays
1 prostrate all the authorities of the country ;
and, instead of securing to them that love
s and refpeft which every friend of his coun
- try must wish to poflefs, they must
t become objefts of abhorrence.
3 But the gentleman from Virginia declares
this is a theatre, on which he will speak,
, and that this is a fubjeft upon which he will
- dwell; from this house an alarm is to be
1 communicated to the people out of drors.
r This is a temple Aom which is to be preach
s ed, not the mor<i| virtues of peace, charity
r and brotherly lore," wh'ch are preach d
1 from other temples, but the fubjeft is to be
- the purity of own conduft,
i the orthodoxy of his own political faith
t and opinions of his friends, and thepo-
Ikical hertzes, and political corruptions of I
his oppÂ»nentÂ«. 1
He thought this must be a fubje-A-of re- <
gret to the gentleman'* frien-ds ; for Â»when ]
tliis habit of preaching was once begun,
the love of it would increase, and though I
he preached in the mod elegant and har
monious manner, the virtues of his friends
would die in the melody of his accents. For
it will be asked, what occasion for this
preaching? I-s political sense and virtue of
that nature that it seeks thus to be extoll
ed ? Sterling worth retires ; it does not be- ,
come its' own trumpeter. It will not,
therefore, be a fubjeit of regvet to hiÂ« op
ponents ; for if he "preaches much, and in
the manner in which he preached yesterday,
he will do them but little harm. The fub
jeft when oft-en dwelt upon will have no
weight ot- credit. There had beru much
preaching of this kind both in church and
state. It might for a time do temporary
inifchief ; but its effefts were transient. He
would, therefore, have dropped the fubjeft
had not the (lander of this gentleman been
too much supported by others.
It was said to be the tendency of all go
vernments to come to despotism ; that true
it was, our government was tolerably pure;
it had dabbled in corruption, but dabbled a
little. And by whom was this said ? For
the name which said this, ought to be a
proud name indeed ; it ought to be distin
guished not only by brilliant public services,
but for a p*euliar disinterestedness of char
after ; to have something around it which
effeftually shielded it from suspicion. By
whom then, has it been said ? What arro
gant and proud pretence had led men to
speak in this manner r What had entitled
them to this high tone ? Eminent talents,
all knew they poffefled. But did mere em
inence of talents entitle men to this right ?
He asked how these talents had been em
ployed ? In great and national service ? In
fixing the independence and freedom'of the
country ? Have they aided in establishing
the great outlines and measures of govern
ment ? Have they assisted in building up the
government, with special interest to the
happmefs of the country ? They do not
pretend this. Not that they have done any
thing for the happinefsof the country, but
in opposition to it. . It would be invidious
to enter into a comparison betwixt the two
characters. But let the gentlemen go *o
the page of history, and what do they find
there ? Had the mere declaimer againlt go
vernment and its abuses, an enviable rank
: on that page ? No. Let me not, said Mr.
G. be misunderstood. Immortal honor is
due, and will be given, to men who have re
filled the afts of tyranny and oppression.
i Such a man was Hampden ; such a [man
i was Sidney. But a mere declaimer ranked
, not with these men ; nor did he rank with
> those who have been the benefaftors of man
, kind by establishing eminent -civil institu
tions. Yet, in that house, gentlemen claim
I ed as a right, upon this mere ground, to
i speak, and when they pleased, of the im
s aginary abuses aud corruption? of govern
> meat. '
t Mr. G. asked, what were these abuses ?
- They were said Â»o arise from executive pa
i tronage. Let the gentleman from Virginia
r go to his state, and the gentleman from
- Pennsylvania to his. Either was an extent
I of country, which, in the old world, would
1 form an empire. What were the officers
- under the executive ? A single judge in the
> judiciary department, a marshal and a few
: deputies, a fuptrvifor and ibme collectors,
f And though this is an epitome of the whole
;! of our country, yet, in the view of the gen
: i tlcman who support this amendment this
j patronage is alarming'and deftruftive !
f Let the gentleman fromPennfylvanialook
t at the supreme executive of that state, and
f he would find a much more numerous lift of
r of officers ; and rf not of a grade so high,
i j yet of a grade at least equally capable of
i j oppression. And was it a fubjeft of popu
; lar declamation that the governor of that
. state was bearing down the government by
r meajis of his patronage ? No. The fubjeft
I was not heard ir. the legislature of thatftate,
: the cry and clamour were only here.
But it was said, that this patronage or
t power of appointment had been basely prof
i tituted, by felefting eminent characters from
i that house for office ? He asked gentleman
5 how many men had been chosen from the
s legislature for office, since thethecommence
- ment of government ? But few indeed. He
. asked farther, if there was any thing in the
s constitution, which declared that members
- of the legislature should not be appointed
i to office; and if not, how it happened'that
t at this period they wfcre growing wiser than
. the framers of our constitution, with rÂ«f
- psft to human nature ? If the doftrine of
gentlemen wat true, which was to ptevent
- this patronage, no officer ought to be ap
s pointed from the Legislature. Would this
. cure the evil ? If human nature be so cor
. rupt as they think it is, have not the mem
. bers of the legislature friends ? And if they
. were capable of being influenced by these
- appointments, the influence might be as
s llrong if their friends were appointed. This
3 doftrine therefore not only went to ostracise
e the members of the legislature, but their
s families and friends.
But it was pretended that the doftrine of
â f Favouritifra had been adopted, and that on
s . lyonedefcriptionofmcn was appointed to of
; sice* He thought there was a great want of
: order iti gentleman who firtt brought for
- ward this fubjet. It was a fubjeft upon
t which it was difficultand indelicate to speak.
The doftrine had been allowed without au
s thority, for the Prcfident of the United
, ..States had not allowed that he had formed
II any such determination as had been attribu
e ted to him ; but if he had determined to
i. feleft to office only thofc persons who had
- evinced, by their manners, an attachment
y to the constitution of their country, and to
i those measures which had been fanftioned
e by the legislature and himfelf, he thought
, be had adopted a right principle. He did
i not think the Prefioent had resolved to ap
point'no man to office, except ht were Â«f
hi* own particular fentimetits, though he
might have determined not to make choice
of any man who had tnanifcfted uuifiorm Â©p
pofition TO all the meafares of government-
He asked what measure had been taken by
the executive, which had not been fan&ioa
by all the constituted authorities, and, -in
a less formal manner, by the people them
selves, and in some cases, by votes of the
State Legislatures.
But he asked against whom these fehargae
of venalityand corruption were made f They
were brought against the executive of this
country. And what was this executive I
Gentlemen seemed to consider it as a fort of
Leviathan or. which was always to
be goaded and probed with a tboufand
wounds for its venal propensities ; tho* for
some of its geod qualities, it must be kept
alive in torture and chains.
The duties of the executive were to pre
serve the powers of the country, to vindi
cate its rights; to prote6l its sovereignty,
to execute the public will exprcfled through
the laws. Rob it of one of these powers,
and you destroy the most valuable part of
the government âdepress it, and you only
do it for a short time. It will rife, on the
affedtions and favomr of the people, witti
new life and vigour. Indeed, these attempts
against the executive, were calculated to
produce a much more strong and powerful
executive than we now have.

Ou ( motiÂ«>ii of Mr.- Gregg, the House resolved itfelT

TheSpEAKER informed the House that he had re
ceived a letter from a member from Vermont, which
he was requested to lay beforethem.
Mr. Rutledgf thought, that [in aJI cases when

: itence of such communications before they were read,
{ in order that improper matters might Hot beÂ£brought
before them.

suggestion, and after stating the fubliance of the let

SALEM, (MafT.) Jan. 26.
Oait. Benjamin late of the Seh'r
Sally, of this port, arrived her* on Wednes
day, from Nantz, where he was carried in
by a privateer, and condemnedâbeingbnund
to Vigo in Spain. He came into Boston fel
low pafTengers with four other mailers, and
27 of their crews, whose vessels and cargoes
had also been condemned, and themselves
robbed and plundered by the barbarians ef
every article of their own personal property
that they coald get hold on.
Capt RufTell informs, that the Americans
captured and carried into Nantz are in a
truly deplorable situation. They are not on
ly llripped of their property, but their
are afTailed as they pass the streets, with the
rudest insults, and/noft bitter curfes,againft
tWmfelve6 and their government. The Ame
rican flag is frequently hoisted, by way of
jnfult, underneath every other. The few
friends the Americans have there, dare not
fay a word in their favour. The crews of
the veflele are turned alhore without the
means of subsistence ; and as there is no
other business than privateering carried on
there,many of them areobliged to enter into
that business, and take up arms against their
countryman, to save themselves from starving
Mr. Dobree, the American Couful, placed
as he is irÂ» a den of privateerfmeo, could do
nothing for the relief of his fellow citiiens
they were therefore indueed to fend on a
memorial to Mr. Skipwith, at Paris, defir
inghis advice and assistance. The memori
al states, that they are captured under va-
Ti'ous pretences, particularly for not having
a paper, which the French term a roll of
equipage, but which tlrey are entirely
unacquaint.ed withâThat they had every
paper which was conceived to be neceflary
among which were certificates from the
French, Spanilh and British ConsulsâThat
many of their people.are tempted with bribes
tÂ£ swear that their "property is enemies'â
That thej' have no opportunity to counte
raft such things in their courtsâThat their
turned aftiore and out of employ
ment was 160âand that the men would be
obliged, unless some provisions was made for
tjiem, to .enter on board the French priva
teers, [Or fiarve.
Capt. Rtiflcll further fays, that there are
evidently great numbers of the French dis
contented with the present order of things
âbut are obligedto fltout Vive la ' Repub-
Uque.âThat the country is full of brigands
âand that new explosions must again con
vulse the nation.
From appearances in some of our smiths
(hops, it may be conjeftured that our nau
tical citizens are determined to fail the o
cean in pe act.
New languages !âWe have lately
seen advertifad, Angloamerican grammars,
and Columbian spelling books. We imagine
that the people who {peak these languages
are some new republics which Jupitar Buon
aparte has established in the aerial regions,
by the thunderbolt which citizen Campenaj
ha 3 armed him with. That they are the
bed languages which exist within the solar
system, is proved by variois advertisements;
and it is recommended to the people of the
United States to discard their present aris
tocratic language, and adopt the Angloa
merican or Columbian, which cannot fail
to preserve the principles of pure democra

Which all we've loft, and more than all rcftonrs.
The following is a correft account of the
fecqnd high handedrobberyin New-York,
mentioned in yesterday's Gazette.
A daring robbery and bnrglary were com
mitted on Tuesday morning, between 12
and one o'clock, at the houle of Grenvill*
Temple, Esq. on the Greenwich Road, of
which th"e following are the particulars, as
nearly as we have been able te colleft :
About the time above-mentioned one of
the women (ervaÃts imagining Ihe heard a
noise at the Ihuttersofthe window, cxprelfed
her fear to Mrs. Temple that some persons
were breaking into the house. Mrs. Tem
ple ridiculed her alarm as groundless ; and
would not have taken further notice of the
matter had not a few minutes convinced her
that the servant's fufpiciona werebut too well
founded. She accordingly drefled herfelf
and prepared for the confeqnences.
After the villains had remained in the
rooms below for the space of an hour and
an half, during which time they had plun
dered them of every thing valtuble, they as
cended the flairs and proceeded to the cham
ber adjoining Mrs. Temple's, where another
of the women servants lay asleep. They a
woke her, and, holding a pistol to her head,
threatened her with immediate death if Ihe
occasioned the lead alarm. Her trunk was
in the room, which they opened, and took
out 30 dollars. They then enquired of the
servant if (lie was the lady of the house and
were answered in the negative. At this in
stant Mrs. Temple (with an amiable cou
rage peculiar to herfelf, and almofl amount
ing to romantic heroism) opened the door,
and presenting herfelf to the nan who ap
peared to be the captain of the gang, en
quired his business with her, informed him
Ihe was the lady of the house, and requeft
cd to be treated with delicacy. This the
man promised, and religiously adhered to :
he put coals into her foot stove, infilled on
her taking a cordial which he prepared for
her to prevent her spirits from being too
much depressed, allured her she was fafe un
der bis proteftiou, and behaved with all the
fang froid imaginable. .
The robbers then proceeded to the objeft
of their visit; and, after taking from Mrs.
Temple a purse containing five dollars, ano
ther containing a quantity as old Gold coins,
some Spanilh money with holes drilled thro'
Banknotes to the valje of 800 dollars, all
the Silver plate, some jewels, a watch of
Mr. Temple's, a blunderbuss, 2 pistols (one
of which they fired in tjieroom,) and a va
riety of other articles, in value amounting
to more than 2000 dollars, they left the
house about 5 in the morning.
Mrs. Temple throughout the whole of
these tranfadH'ons, cwndufted herfelf witn a
manly fortitude,' and a composure which a
ftouiThed even the villains themselves.
Mr. Temple had embarked for Europe
some \rfeeks ago to join his regiment, and
no roan servant was in thf house at thie time
when the robbery was committed.
The men had' their faces blacked, wore
black wigs and waggoner's frocks, and
ten in number Fium their conduft they
appeared to have a perfeÂ£t knowledge of
the house, and of the domestic. concerns of
the family. Their chief profeffed to have
known Mrs. Temple in Boston, at a tirtoe
when adverse circumftartces ha<3 not riduced
him to the necessity of following art occu
pation at once so disagreeable and fotfange
rons.

The committee of privilege*, to whojn
was rÂ» flirt*! a resolution oft the Joth Jsii.
ctf&fg'ng Mr. Lyon- vfritf. diforderlv beha
vior :âwith irtÃi ufJons to enquire into the
wholt 'matter thereof, and to report the
fame with their opin'on thereon, to ,tl c
hone, having examined the several witne(TeÂ«
on oath touching the fubjeft,
RfiPOSLT,
That during the fitting of the house of
representatives, on the 30th Jan. the tellers
of the house being ongagwJ in counting the
ba'lots for managers of the impeachment a
gainst Win, Blount, the speaker had left
hik chair, and many members their feats, as
is usual on such occasions. The fpejkcr
was fitting in one of tine member's feat*
next to the bar the house, afttl f-Vcr~l
members near him, of whfrm Mr. Gr.'fwold
was one.
Mr Lyon was (landing without the bar
of the House, leaning on the farr.e, and
holding a conversation with the Speaker
he spoke loud enough to be heard by all
those who were near him, as if he intend
ed to be heard by them. The fubjedt of
his conversation was, the tondnft of the
Reprefentatires of the State of Conic&icut
(of whom Mr. Grifwold is one)â' Mr. Ly
on declared that they afted in opposition to
the interest and opinions of nine-tenths of.*
their co iftituentsâthat they were pursuing
their own private views, without regarding
the interest of the people of that State, that
they were ieeking otJu.es, which they were
willing to accept whether yielding nine
thousand or one thoufafid dollars. Tie fur
ther observed, that the people of thac Stale
were blinded and deceived by those Repre
ientatives, that they' were permitted to fee
but one tide of the qu.'ftion in politics, be
ing lulled asleep by the opiates which the
| members from that Hate adniiniftered to
them, âwith other exprcfÃons equally tend
ing to derogate from the political integrity
of the Reprefentatiycs of the State of Con
necticut.
On Mr. Lyon's observing that if he
(hould go into Conne&icut, and manage a
press there fix months, although the people
of that flats were not fond of Revolution
ary principles, he could effeft a Revolution
and turn out the present Representativesâ.
Mr. Grifwoli, replied to these remarks, and
among other things said, if you go into
Connecticut, you had better wear your
wooden sword, or words to that effedi, al
luding to Mr. Lyon's having been cashiered
in the army.
Mr. Lyon did not notice the allusion at
this time, but continued the conversion
on the fame fubjeftâMr. Grifwold then
left his feat, and flood next to Mr. Lyon,
leaning oa the bar, being outside the fame:
On Mr. Lyon's faying that he knew the
people of Connediicut well, having lived a
mong them many years, that he had fre
quently had occasion to .fight them in his
own diftrift, and that he never failed to con.
viace themâMr. Grifwold asked, if he
fought them with his "wooden fwordâOa
which Mr. Lyon spit in his face.
The Committee having attentively con
sidered the foregoing state of fadb, and hav
ing heard Mr. Lyon in hi* defence, arc of
opinion, .that his canduÂ£l in this tranfa&ioa
was highly indecorous and unworthy of a
member of this house. f
They therefore recomra&id the adoption
of the resolution fnbmitted to their confide
ratiou by the house, in the words following,
to wit :
" Rcitlvcd, that Matthew Lyon, a mtmber of
this hÂ«ulc, for a violent attack and grol , indecsncy
committed on the ptrfoo of Roger Grifwold, inn
th;r member, in the prefenee of this house, whilst
fitting, be, for this diforjerly behavior, expelled
