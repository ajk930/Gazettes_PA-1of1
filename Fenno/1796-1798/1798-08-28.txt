PHILADELPHIA, iÂ«
v
EVENING, Augujl 28. j t l
The Jacobi prints, the Chronicle and j
Aurora, reproate the policy of interdi&ing '
ccsmmet'ce bewien the United States and j j (
the French ports in the Islandsâ" when
such flattering to the enterprize of
the American Merchants were ripening"â t
This flattering profpeft is produced by that
policy which the faction reprobate. The Â£
trade his hitherto proved the grave of our
velTels ai d cargoesâThe interdiÂ£lion may
open their eyes to jtlllice a>d found policy ;
Interim, it is not ill the jower of all the {
lying foreign, Gazettes in tie United States v
to prove, that the trade of tie islands can be
flattering or profitable, so bng as the plun
dering anti-commercial fyftirr of the present
rulers of France and her cdonies continues.
On this fubjeft the Maffaihufctts Mercury
contains the following judicious remarks. {
"It is confiflent withCHRONtcLE fairngfs ,
in general to impute to the friends of our j
I government a wish to ftarie the inhabitants t
of the French ColoniesâOther motives ar '
obvious. The American*have had the.car- |
goes of their reffels feizei in French ports t
and confifcated ; they hate in other inftan- â¢,
ces, had their merchandize taken from them, f
prices set upon it, and payment made in
I(land pr'oducr; the price of which was also '
set by the fame party; American vtfTels j
have been captured by French cruizers,
when bound to or from Â£ngli(h, Neutral or |
evem French ports, and condemned ; A me- j
ricans have been insulted, beaten, murdered ,
by French privateerfmcn } Some Viten j
turned on ftltrtfetta the Wejl Indies, without a ,
change ofcloathing from their own ch.efts, j
or a mojfel of provisions ffom their own
cargoes ;/aÂ«d have in some instances Itarved
or taken /ifeafes which have destroyed them.
Were ntt thtfe things fufficient to rouse
refentmtht in every mind ? When too we
knew ie deserved gratitude for onr sup
plies nther than such usage ? What could
be mote natural than to convince them of
their dependance upon u3. When the in
tercoirfe has been flopped for a flioct time,
they will know how to appreciate Â«ur
friendftip ; they "will know we art not such
koofs a to put victuals into the mouth
whichcurfes, or strengthen the arm which
plunders us. The eyes of the common class
of citizens will be opened, they will truce
the cause of their miseries to their rulers,
and they will be our avengers. Then will
Our granaries again be free; then will the
bee! cf America again cheer the honest I{lan
ders. This is the consummation aimed at,
aftd this is a oonfummation devoutadly to
be wilhed."
[ln the Gazette of Monday the 20th Inflant,
ibme articles were published from a Boflonpa
per, the Mercury of the "14th, (Utifig that pro
visions were extremely fcarec at St Domingo.
In the Chronicle of the 20th the ftatem?nt
was coutr*di<Jled and the mme of capt Bates
brought forward to confirm the contradiction.
The Mercury of the wfl contains the follow
ing pointed refutations of the Chronicle falfe
hoods.J
" Cap} Bates has called upifn us and autho
rized us to fay, that he never gave the intelli
gence of which yesterday's Chronicle mates him
thÂ« author. He never faicl nor knew that He
â¢ douville sent either hens, turkeys, geese, lem
ons, oranges or pine apples to any Englilh 'offi
cer ; or that./itu/j were eaten at the civic feaft,
( though he recolle&s hearing that they had no
bread) Or, that there were 30S0 barrels flour
in the magazines. Thus it i'eems, that under
old or new, Editor, communicating one fort of
intelligence or anather, the Chronicle supports
its thara&er as a LYING If APE R.
To the 'Editor i of the Mercury.
" In yesterday's Chronicle, I noticed a pub
lication, which is principally erroneous. It re
lates to the recerit news from Cape Francois, and
invalidates accurate flatements in the Mercury
and Centinel. I went the voyage in the fame
veilel with capt Bates and was as well situated
for obtaining information.
" The Spanilh vefiel mentioned in the " Â»d
proof," was not captured till after we fai'ed.â
She was loaded with cattle and w,as ordered for
N Mole. No ox was taken to find to Hedou
ville. A flag of truce had gone in, carried by
the captain ot the frigate, the avowed purpose,
to exchange a few prisoners, but the real defiga
to obtain information of the situation of the
Cape and of veflels there. ThiÂ» flag had not
returned when we parted with the British fri
gate. And this is the foundation of the migh
ty (lory of the ox, and the 300 hens, turkeys,
geese, &c. &e, âI was told by a French offu er
the fi<st which has been slated refpeiting He
douville's dinner of plantair.s and potatoes.
" The " 3d proof" mentions an elegant en
tertainment given to the people .1 do remember
a fort of holy-day like our ElcÂ£lion and Com
mencement Days ; but Ido not believe there
were many fowls eaten ; Nor do I think there
were so many fowls in the whole island as were
said to have been devoured on that day. I can
not conceive how capt Bates fliould be a " wit-
the fealt," when he pc.fitively was nÂ»t on
(hore the whole day. It is antrue that TÂ°uf
faiat was present at the feaft, as he left the Cape
the very day previous to it. . 1
Â«' The Chronicle fays " There was at the
Cape 30CO barrels of flour in the Public Maga
zine*." A baker told me there was none ex
cept in the hands of bakers, and with them on
ly fufficient to lafl a Ihort time.
" Small roUt, which I think did not contain
more flour than our bilcuit, fold for ten
Cents
Â«' The French frigates at the Cape, the Cock
ade, the Seine and theJÃrave, had theircrews
fed with plaintains and potatoes. The people
ot the Cockade, that being the Commodore (hip
were quiet; but the crews of the other two were
mutinous, and were nnf fuffered to come on
flioreat thefeftival, 011 account of this spirit.
" When we firft arrivtd at the Cape, in pair
ing an arrtied brig, they demanded who we were
and our pilot, in order to facilitate our pafling,
answered, "an A-mciican with ptoviiions,"
which occafionc.l shouts of joy.

the.mii.ds of men, and in that way to con ii
vinee them, take a (horter '.vay 'to fiffetl ti
thfir deiigns by addressing themfclves to u
their passions and prejudices. Nothing can n
more fully verify this remark than th? con p
dust of the modern Revolutionists and Pfii- ,c
lofophers of Europe and America. The >'
pariyin this country, disappointed in their J
bppofition to, the Britiih Treat) ; and in r
their attempts to eleÂ£l Mr. Jefferfon to the i
office of prelident, and put us und.-r the 1
contrOul of France, have redoubl.d th.ir f
adlivi'y in spreading (land r ana falriiood v
among the lead informed part of the com
munity, to alienate their attachment from \
their own government, and to unite them g
with an unprincipled foreign natioa in op 0
poiition to their own country.
The people are told. " That the pe-fnns c
â¢who adminijler our Government, and those ! (i
who support the late measures which have \ â 
teen adopted, -are old Britijh Tories, who are 0
endeavouring to bring us back to our former f
Jlate of Colonial Dependence." The tale of t
itfelf seems too idle to r quire eontradic- j
tion j but when we coufider how great a Â£
part of mankind are moved and influenced I
by their prejudices, without taking time to 1
reflect, it may not be thought useless to 1
'make a few obfervation3 upoa it. For my- 1
felf, I have no doubt, that the class of peo
ple who were called Tories, in . the time of
our late Revolution, have been generally as .
firmly attached to our Government as any
other description of men ; some of- them, I
know during our late infurreftion were the
firft in support of Government, to expose
themselves to dangers in the high places ot
lbs ficlJ. But let it be fnppofed, tor the
present confideratipn, that they are unfriend
ly to a Republican Government, and are
seeking to bring us into fubjeflion to Great
Britain. I would then a(k wTiere theft Old
Tories are to be found, who conditute, at
lead, two thirds of the whole American
peoj'le ? No where- -unless it be in the dis
ordered imaginations of the felf called pa
triotic republicans, and in the weak mind*
of ciedulous men, who have been wrought
upon by such hob-goblin dories.
Who are the chaiaders that are intended
to be stigmatized as Old Tories ? They are
Adam 3, Washington, Jay, and a long lid
of worthies, who were the firll movers, and
the firm and deady conduftorsof that revo
lution which fevered us from the British Em
pire, and gave us rank among Independent
nations. Who are the fupporlers of these
characters, and of the present measures of
government ? As we have not the means of
knowing the fetitiments of the people in the
reir.ote parts of the Union, we will only took
' look around U3 in New-England. The
four New dates fend twenty-seven
represent tives that num.
1 bcr three only can be counted on the fide of
opposition ; ic it is confidently expected that
not more than one of them w.ll be re-clcÂ£l
: ed. The Representation from New-Eng
land is then almod nine-tenths in support of
â¢ the meafure3 of Governm.nt. But look
at the late addrefTes of the several legisla
tures ot the fame dates to the President,
you will there fee in those four legislatures
. 482 votes decidedly in approbation of the
1 measures of the Executive, arid pledge
â¢ themselves and their constituents for their
supportâin tppofition to those addrefTes
you will .ind only the diminutive and pitiful
| number of thirty-fix. Almolt fifteen fix
teer.ths then of all the people in the four
New-England Hates, we may firmly con
s elude, are on the fide of government and of
! the adminidration.
Were all the people of New-England,
who were thefird and braved supporters of
our Independence, Old Tories ? Was the
firm and virtuous Adams, who signed the
1 declaration of Independence, and managed
r affairs of the highest importance at foreign
: courts, was he an enemy and traitor to his
' country ? Was the great and illudri.ous
j Wufhington, who led our armies in the field
and whose fame as a guardian genius llovets
. over this land, was hc opposed to the prin
ciples of our revolution and to our national
' independence ? Are the large majority of
both houfe9 of Congress, men feledted for
' their virtue, integrity and talents, old To
j ries? If these are the o d Tories, of whom
our Democrats so loudly declaim, what vir
tuous American will not be proud to be
, seen en their fide ? Let the followers of the
infidel, Jefferfon, and the foreigner Galla
' tin, call the vetcaa heroes and sages of AÂ»
mcrica by wh3t epithets they pleale ; I trud
my countrymen will have too much difcarn
ment to be cheated out" of their liberties,
; by the insidious artifices of political fwind
: lers, and too much spirit and firmnefs to
: surrender them to the corrupt and deteflable
' tyrants of France.

They have dedroyed all diplomatic inter

s to our trade, and dedru&ive of t/ie bed in

plicated them to hear our complaints, and
â to do us julliceâthey have treated our mes
sengers of reconciliation with contumacy â
r* they have turned a deaf ear to our entreaties
e âthey have turned on their heel from us.
[5 What then remains to be done ? Shall we

- FROM A LONDON PAPER.
The hostile condudt of the French go
n vernment towards the United States confi
â  dered in' a political point of view, and with p
refpeft to the situation of the French Weft a
Jndia IflanJs, which entirely fubfilt on the
I supplies received from America, is the more
extraordinary, as it is so cÂ° .'trary to the
interests of France. But if we view this fl
conduit as arifmg out of the spirit of the a
French revolution, it is easily accounted for. r
France is burthened with an enormous debt
"for provilions received from the Americans
in the course of this war, and American ci- c
tizens have also laid out very considerable t
sums in purchasing national estates itl t
France. In cafe of a war with America, ,
the Dire&ory will immediately suspend the
payment of the money due to America, and' (
-will sequestrate all American property in ,
I France The debt will thus be discharged,
and th> property fold, which are two very ,
valuable revolutionary advantages gained by
France. As to the French Weft India co
lonies, thev scarcely engage the attention of 1
the Direftory, France being without trade, ,
and likely to get some indemnification by .
She capture of the prizes.
In America, tKe publication of the cot
refpondence with France has' produced the
happiest effc&s ; and the conduit of the
mod violent oppofitiomlls in that | enale Â»
holds out a very laudable example for the
I imitation of others 111 this country- e
partisans of France c lied loudly for the
printing of the correspondence fr m the
American corhmulioners in France, luppo-
Gn? that their iJtflro&lAns were not ot that
conciliatory nature as ought to have been
jri-cn them. But no sooner was the cor
respondence made public, than two 01 the
leading opptfttion members rose to move
and leconu an address to the President of
' the United States, thanking htm for his
godlj conduit throughout the progrefe 10
I ' the negoci-tion. This is the la.elt news
from America, and we underload form a
part of Si. Robert Liftoa's d.fpatches, ot
'which his fecretat y was the bearer. Ihe
