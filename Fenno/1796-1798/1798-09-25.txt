RULES, S

FROM SPREADING OR BECOMING
EPIDEMIC. a
THERE is no evil in the world in which j
the great rule of " refitting the beginning, r j
is more applicable than in the present cafe.
And, as the means heretofore employed, v
have not been fuccefsful in preventing the h
yellow fever from spreading o r becoming
epidemic, after having gained admittance in- v
to the city, I beg leave to propose the sol- Â£
low lug, which I believe will, if adopted and #
ftridtly obferv.d, be found effeftual for that c
purpof â¢. And, as tliev are derived from | \
the experience of past age*, I hope they 1
will not be rejefted by those whose duty it f
is to provide fur the public welfare, unlcfs c
they can fubllitute rules of more efficacy. j a

icortfiftcntly with the principles of t
The plea therefore that private mtereft and (
the will of the individual it bound to fubm.t ,
to the intertft and will of the .Society of ,
which he is a member, (which being exprdf- ,
ed by t'h- majority of the legal reprefenta- ,
lives of that foci ty, becomes a law) is luf- j
ficient to juftify. the peaceable removal ot ,
tVerv individual or f.vmily, in wh'ch a con- ,
tagious dlfeafe of a malignant kind makes ,
Its firH: appearance, to such from <
tlie city as will prevent all danger of its be- 1
ing communicated to 'he reft of the inhabi- 1
tants of the city. And as the yellow fever
has heretofore always made its firft appear
ance in some of the lodging houses 01 ta
verns near the water, frequented by fearoen,
or among persons who have tranfaftcd bufi.
refs with vessels recently arrived from the
W- ft-Indies, it should be made the interest
of every person or family in which it ap
pears, to make instant discovery of it to the
guardiars of the Health laws, by granting
a suitable reward to the informer, and de
tering from concealment by the severest pe
nalties.
To prevent all concealment, collusion or
deception, let a small fallary be allowed tÂ»
tTrrev r ??.{frei! i g r l oÂ¥ s a Ts^^ r or b ?k n ?. i .7 t Â°
liberties, and par icularly to the grave dig
gers of the ft rangers' burying grounds,
whose business it should be to procure the
the name, and account of the nature of the
disease of every person that he is employed
to burv, aud to report the fame to the guar
dians of the Health laws previouflv to inter
ment ; who, upon any caute of ftifpieion,
{hould immediately fend two experienced
Physicians to make the necessary examina
tion and enquiry.
Let a fufficient number of buildings with
fcparate apartments after the manner of the
wards of an hospital, with suitable accom
modatittn, be provided for the reception of
the sick, at a proper diftanpe from the city,
in a high and airy fit nation, and also for the
whole family in which the disease makes its
appearance, where they may be attended
and nursed by their relations and friends,
without anv danger of being affi&ed by the
contagion ; for it is a known fa&, however
lingular and extraordinary it may appear,
that the yellow fever is very seldom contagi
ous in the air of the country, in this climate
especially in healthy situations.
This circumstance alone one would think,
would be fufficicn- not only to reconcile each
individual of us to tViis measure, but to make
it cur earnest rcqucft to be remove' to a si
tuation so full of f*fety and consolation,
when compared with that of the city, where
if the difenfe is fuffertd to extend its malig
nant ravages among the inhabitants, the
wretched viÂ£Ums of disease are left to fink
under a load of complicated miseries, with
out th<- presence of a sympathising friend,
to console them in their la ft mome nts, for
alas ! humanity itfelf ceafe3 when compani
on to another would be fatal to ourselves.
Even escape itfelf is destitute of pleasure,
when wc refle& that we leave those whom
we lovr or esteem behind, to the care of
mercenary nurses, to ptrifh by the most de
ftrcftive of maladies.
If the disease should make its firft ap
pearance in any of the more opulent fami
lies, the fame measures should be obftrved,
with refpeft to them, as with those in the
most neccflitous cireumflances, with only
this exception, that they should be allowed
to remove to their own feats in the country
upon giving fecuri;y not to return to the ci
ty after their recovery, till after the fitting
in of hard froft, which is now known to be
a perfedt antidote to the eontagion of the
yellow fever, provided the articles which
itftially harbour it, be exposed for forr.e
time to its influence.
It will be the fafeft method therefore, to
stint up every infefted hr>nfe, after the re
moval of the family, till the arrival of froft
and then after removing ewry article of
cloathing and furniture, "*to have all the
windows open for thirty or forty days, af
ter which it may he occupied with fafety.

SIR,
We, the underfigied officerc jtnd soldiers

other inhabitants of Burlint;toii and its vi

body of the citizens of the United States,
and even with those who have hcre'ofore ad- j.
dressed you, upon the present eventful pe
riod, yet being assembled to cefcbrate the q
ever memorable Fourth of July, conceive that
we cannot devote our hnurs to a more no- j
hie and patriotic purpose than expressing to
you our zeal in support of the rights to
which this day give bifthÂ« We will not j
confumc time in the repetition of inve&ives
against that government which w.e have, till
of late, admired for their republicanism ;
i we fay nothing of their unprovoked ag^ref
fions on otir lawful commerce, of their un-
i founded complaints, of their infalts upon
: our meflengers of peace and amity : but, be .
j assured, Sir, that we (hall ever hold ourf-Ives
in readiness to support your admiaYftration
in repelling any attempts to wrest from ns
our ihdepeadetice and national rights. We
therefore, in the spirit of' 76, which we this
day recognize, in the most unequivocal man
ner, without the leaft'refervation whatever,
tender to you ourselves/ and whenever re
quired will rally round the Itandard of our Â£
liberties, and risk every thing we hold dear
in fociety.'for the defence of our Conititu
tion, and the government of our own choice ;
the wisdom of which haa filled the world
with admiration j marked us with the envy
of foreign nations, and its just impartial ad
miniftratio*. caused {in many p.irf#bf Ame- J
rica) the wilderness to (1 flam as the rose.
We take this opportunity to declare to
you, S r, our entire confidence in the execu
tive. and all other constituted anthorities of . J
the government, and believe tlat your ad- j
ministration, as well as that of your worthy
predecessor, has at all times been conduced
in a manner the bed calculated to naintain
our national dignity and promote the inter
est of our citizens at large, on principles of
ft rift neutrality. We alto believe that thofc
who have endeavored tÂ® lessen the confidence
which ought to be placed in the mitiiftera of
a government (which we are convinced has
been the cafe in America) and at this a
larm'ngcrifis continued to do it, are decided
enemies to the government itfelf and would
><Â«ppy to fee it trembling on the brink of
e^anefcence.
We fleprecatc mc norrom of war, and
most earnestly pray for the continuance of
peace with all nations but if wÂ« cannot have
peace without facrificing our national digni
ty, without having a French Directory to
di&ate our government and regulate our
commerce, let us have war, we'll cheerfully
meet it with all its concomitant evils, rather
than admit for Â« moment such degraded
princip'es ; snd should those who make it
their boa ft of having delivered us from tbe

â  the fate of Venice. Let our citizens all feel

To the Officers and Soldiers of the Cavalry,

tants of Burling<â ' its vicinity, in the
d county a/ Chittenden 'â¢ of Vermont.
c Gentlemen,
y My journey to this place clayed till
d this time, an anfwe* to you. iging ad-
Y dress of the fourth of July. \our zeal in
support of those rights to which that me-
S morable day gave birth, is as natural as your
,e resolution to ho'd yourselves in readiness to
c support and defend them is commendable,
h- The conftitutiop and government of your
e own choice has indeed caused the wilderness
in many parts of America, to blossom as
0 the rose. Your confidence in the executive,
r " and all other constituted authorities of the
ft government, and your testimony in favor of
>f my administration, as well that of my great
' e predecessor, as far as it relates to me does
1 * me honor, and as fir as it relates to him
does honor to yourselves. Your opinion of
_ the oppofltion may seem severe, but as it
"l refpefts manv of the most fciveKrate, though
'y perhaps the most pUufible; I cannot hesitate
k to believe it just. A French Dire&ory to
diftatc to you who (hall be your rulers! and
who (hall be your ambaffadars ! A worth
less tyrant of a king oace said, " let me
have the appointment at my pleasure of jud- J
ges and bimops and I will have what law
and gospel I please." Let a French Direc
tory have the choice of your Prefrdeiits,
Governors and Ambaffadars, and you may
as well give them legislative authority over
you in all cases whatsoever. Rather than
this, I fay with you, let us have war, we ,
will cheerfully meet it; rather than admit
for a moment of such degraded principles.
Those who make their boasts of having de
livered us from the power of tyranny may t
now with equal modesty, undertake to rule f
over us.âAmerica delivered France from ,
the power of tyranny, at least, as truly as *
France did America. Let the history of
both countries from 1763 to 1774 deter- j
mine.âThe rising generation in America j
has not fufficiently attended to Ihis fubjeft.
It has been carefully concealed from their
studies and contemplation.
France I hope will find us still determined
to be free ; our citizens in fufficient num
bers will feel the spirit of real Americons.
I hope you will have wisdom and firmnefs
in your councils and a Washington to lead
your armies.

FELLOW-CIT IZ*NS.
OUR address of the ittinft was in
tended to pr.fer.t to your view the deplora
ble ft ate of our city, and to excite into ac
tive exertion thephila thropy and benevo
lence so eminently charafteriftic of the iiti
7,eiiS of Pennfylvatjia. The fame generous
featimcnts which you have difplaytdhas in
fluenced the wortliy ai d benevolent citizens
of Bait more ; who always alive to the feel
ings of humanity, have, it app ar6 by the
-public papers, agretd to a fubfeription for
the relief of our diilreffed fellow citizens.
We return them all the gratituoe and ref
peÂ£t to which dispositions so. amiable are:,
entitled ; âbut it becomes our diuy publiqj i
ly to ttate that a fu d has been provided for
the purpose, upon the principal of a lo in
in antici[uvtion of the liberality and justice
of our which precludes the '
Bect-ffity of donations in money from the ,
humane citizens of our filter (talesâC n
tribtitious of pr visions fro our
tizens in the ccu-.try, ?5 well in New Jersey
as in our own State, have been Forwarded
for the use of thediftieffid, with a liberali
ty which-does honor to the donops. 1
We flatter ourfelvts that similar donations ]
will be cofltiiHied by those generous indivi- t
duals, who are contiguous to the city, and
car, with convenience spare a part of their J
produce for the relief of fuffer'ng humanity. J
