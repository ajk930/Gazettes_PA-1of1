Th follow-in; Character of this work
d is cxtraacd frtnn the Monthly R'cview, p. 311, 31a, for
it March, 1793.
LS Â« We have no small degree of pleasure in anno uncing
j- theprefent work to our readers ; as one v. h'ch from the
1- Irecdom of-itserrquiry, the grandeur of its views, and the
fortitude of its principl.s, is eminently deserving of atten
*** tion. By this eulogiuM, we would by 110 means be under
stood to fubfe'ribt to all the principles which these volumes
contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived at that degree of
certainty which is requifitJ, fdr any two men to think a
like on all fubje&s; neither has language attained that con
' fiftent accuracy, which can ehible them to convey their
ur thoughts, even <vhen they do think alike, in a manner per
fectly correil artd intelligible to both. These difficulties
~~ are only to he overcome by a patient, incefiant, and bene
volent iriveftigstisn.
n( j " Many of the opinion: which this work contains, are
t0 bold; some bf them are novel ; andfbmedoubtlefsare er
roneous :âbut that which ought to endear it evert-to theffe
whose principles it may offend, is the ftrerigt/i of argu-'
he ment adduced in it to prove, that peace and order most efJ
fe6lually promote the happiness actor which political re*
formers'are panting -â-that as the progress of knowledge
is gradual, political reform ought net to be precipitate;â
and tfiat convulsive violence is dangerous not only to indi
viduals (for thai rcfult comparatively would be of small
account) but to the general caufe,of truth. It is the opÂ»
pofite of this principle mat infpirer the enemies of politic*
ai enquiry with so much terror ; it is the rifppofition that
change mud inevitably be attended by the turbulence and
injustice of commotion; and that innovation cannot be'
made without the intervention of evils more deftru&ive
than those which are intended to be reformed. Under the
-â_ .a.:. r un-imhrnpic fentimcnt, of calm and
gradual reform, (which in its he has fully il
luflrated) Mr. Godwin proceeds without scruple firft to en
quire into present evil, through its eifential brancka*, and
next to demontlrate future good.
'â¢ Dividing his work into eight books, aÃd making the
IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS the fubjeA of
the firft, he begins by an attempt to prove th* omnipo
tence of government over the moral habits of mankind;
and that on these moral habits their wisdom, virtue and
felicity depend."

" THIS is emphatically the tomb of genius and_
<rf science. Their child, their martyr is here
posited, and their friends will make his eulogy in
tears ; I stand not here to pronounce it. The
thought that engrofles my mind is thisâhow mueh
mora clear and inprefiive must be the views which
the late spiritual inhabitant of that lifelcfs corpse
now polTefTes of God, of his infinite exigence, of his
adorable attributesâof that eternal blaze of glory
which emanates from him, than when (he was
blinded by her veil of flefh. Accustomed as she
was to penetrate far into the univerfeâfar as cor
poreal er mental vision here can reach, ftHl, what
new and extenfivefcenes of wonder have opened on
her eyes enlightened and invigorated by death !â
The discoveries of Rittenhoufe since he died have
already been more and greater than while he lived.
Yes, and could ne address us from the spiritual
world, his language would be,
" All, all on earth is Jhadoiv, all beyotid
I\JubJiance âth. teverfeis folly's creed."
He would, doobtlefs, admonish us to live for eter
nity, and not for time. He would warn U3 to re
gard the whole period of this shadowy and palling
ttatc a* â¢ space of inllru&ion, of discipline, of trial 5
of preparation for a state that is to follow : And he
would charge us to afe all our talents and endow,
menu under the sensible influence of this impreifion,
and to difchargc the whole business of life with this
view. This is a view truly great and elevated ;
truly and only worthy of au intelle&ual, moral, and
immortal being. This is the view that unriddles
human life; that gives meaning to all its teeming
mysteries; that explains the intention of all its
toils, its afflictions, and its trials; that presents an
object suited to th jfe ceaseless grafpings of the foul
â¢f which we are all conftious, but which no mortal
ever did or ever can fill with any possession or at
tainment en this fide the grave. Say that a future
world is to rcftify the disorders, to supply the defi
ciencies, to compensate the labours and to reward
the fufferings of the present ; fay, that the fool of
virtue shall there drink to the full, (hall expand her
faculties and putfue her pleasures without hindrance,
and (hall find that " these light Â»ffliÂ£lions whieh
" are but for a moment, work out for her, a faf
" nyore exceeding and eternal weight of glory,"
and you givedelign and dignity to the present state
of man. He is leen to live for an end worthy his

be God, this view cannot De withdrawn from the
believing mind. It i 6 opened and rendered perma
nent by the sure word of revelation. This word af
ftires us of a future sxiftence. It aflures the pardon
of fin and eternal life, to him who relies, by faith,
on the infinite merits of the Redeemer. It teaches
that through tepentance and the renovation of our
nature by the spirit of grace, the human mind may
be fa purged from its moral defilement, as to be ad
mitted to the prcfence, and capacitated for the en
joyment, of mncreatcd purity. That when thus at
tempered it shall a&ually dwell with God forever,
and eternally grow larger in its conceptions of him,
and of his various and ineffable excellence diffufed
through the immensity and diversity of his works.
The fitne word inHrudtsus that all the dispensations
of I rovidence towards us here, are means wifely
calculated to produce in us the celestial temper, and
to fit us for the tranfeendant felicity, we contem

this tomb and resolve to regard the high designa
tions of nature. Rightly regarding this, wa. shall
fill up life with ufefulnefs and duty, we shall bear its
burdens with patience, and we shall look forward to
its close with pleafuie. We fliall consider death but
a* the lirtb of a new and nobler exiftenee, as a dark
but Ihort pafiiga to the region, of eternal day ; and
in the very agony of our change we may exclaim in
triumph, " O death, wh&c is ihy Uing ! O grave,
11 where is thy victory { Thanks be to God who

[concludes.]
With honed pride I fee my country bom to il
luminate the uniVtrfe. Her birth-day is the birth
day of freedom, and of :rue political science over
the whole earth. In seventy fix the dawn, in eigh
ty three the morning star, is eighty seven the fun
arofc upon the world. The pliilofophers of Eu
rope kindling their tapers at his fires have begun to
ftied on thedarknefs of despotism a light dreadful
to tyrants. The tyrants aghast are all trembling
their thrones are totteringâtwo have already sal
len with a tremendous convulsion. And the reft,
rocking to their foundations, threaten fhoitly to bu

thee O my beloved country ! has commenced

Americans! what an illustrious motive is this, to
cherifli in your bofgms the sacred flame of patriot

example, after the tyranny of so many ages, is, 'at

taericans f to mark out before them the path of
virtue, as Well as of freedom. By virtue you have
eftablilhed your rights as a nationâAnd virtue
will be the solid an 1 eternal basis of the republic.â
If virtue and liberty combined fliauld from hence
forth pervade and regenerate the earth, what a tri
umphant profpetfc would their piogrefs yield to ev
ery lover of his country, and of mankind ? I cannot
anticipate it but with a sweet enthusiasm. The
grandeur of the feene expands the miad beyond
Iter common dimenfioniâand the contemplation of
fueh extcofive happiness to man intoxicates the
heart with a charming delirium. The fourth of Ju
ly shall be the most illustrious feftival in the universe
âIt (hall be cenfecrated as the birth day of na
tions, as the commencement of a new otder' of
things in the world,
My countrymen 1 having begun a career so
splendid, let not the sacred cause of liberty be tar
niflied in our hands. The minions of tyrants have
boldly pronounced on the impotence of the people
to govern themselves ; and triumphed in theexpec
ted convulsion* that time will produce. Beware of
the rocks of jealousy and of fa<3ion. These are
the chief dingers to be dreaded by you. Hardly
any others can obftrud, even for a mdment, yÂ«ur
rapid progression to felicity and glory. The mu
tual jealousy of dates, by dividing, will enfeeble the
operations of the union. Fa&ion is only the con
tinual effort of private passions to throw back so
ciety into that chaos from which man, by the sub
ordinations of government, has endeavored to re

BRITISH PARLIAMENT. I
HOUSE OF COMMONSâFriday, May 6.
Impeachment of the Minister.
Mr. Grey said, those who consider the power of
the Minilter io_that House, the little disposition
that had beenmanifefted to inquire into hiscondufl ;
but, on the contrary, the readinef* difplaycd on
all occafioo* to give most unbounded con
fidence in every tranfadtfon, will naturally conclude
it is a vain and extravagant attempt to bring for
ward charge*, calculated to lay the foundation of
an impeachment. He was aware of these difficul
ties, and he almost despaired of success ; but he did
not feel that he could discharge his duty to hi* con-
Itituents and to his Country, without listing to
that house, and fuppoiting his statements by in
controvertible evidence, that the King's MinifÂ»crs
had contravened fpecific important aÂ«fts of Parlia
ment, and violated some of the mod eflential of our
laws, made to guai'd the expenditure of the public
money, in concealing fripm the knowledge of
the House of Commons the true disposition they
had made of it, and prtffeÃting falfe accounts, in
order to deceive the guardians of the public purse.
It was not neceflary to date the duty of a member
of Parliament to superintend the expenditure of the
public money, to giant with caution and inquire
withjealoufy Their power over the purse of the
people was the belt ffrcurity for the liberties of the
country, the highed authority delegated by their
condituents. These are faÂ£ts which will not be dis
puted. In all, in even the worll of times, the/
have been admitted. And as it has always been the
duty of this House to wateh with suspicion the naÂ«
tional expenditure. This duty becomes more
urgent a* our expence* increase, as our debts accu
mulate. But he would not enter into a detail of
themelancholy magnitude of oÂ«r r*t>Â»ncÂ»c; ?his was
not the objeS of his inquiry, and he should care
fully avoid it. HÂ« wiihed to call the attention of
the house to-the way in which the public money had
been disposed of, and to bring them to examine how
tar the mod wholcfome legislative provilions had
been complied with. He had heard gentlemen in
that House, when the game laws were difcufied, de
preciate any innovation on them, as they had been
handed down by our anceltors, who had cemeirted
them with theirblood; if any alteration, however"
salutary, was proposed in some of our ol 1 opprefilvc
laws, we weie told our forefathers had fought for
them, and we should be cautious of touching what
had been faiÂ«Â£lioned by the wisdom of age*. This
was a common and favorite language in that house j
and thi* night, so far as regarded his motion, it was
a language in which he would heartily concur. He
did not call upon the house to make any change in
the edablifhed laws or cudoms of the laud ; he cal
led upon it to maintain and support one of its oldest
and mod invaluable ptivileges, a privilege which,
whether we appreciate it by its antiquity or by the
zeal with which our ancedors on all occasions have
defended it, or by its iftual importan: e to the iiappi
nefs and welfare of the people, is one of the mod va
luable belonging to a House of Commons. For
no privilege have our fortfather* bled more freely,
than for the right of holding the purfedrings of the
nation ; and in do inliaoce have they manifefted
their wtfdom more confpicupufly, than in the un
shaken zeal with which they have maintained it. It
wai in fnpport of the good old principles of our an
cedors, that he now called upon the house, and he
cxpedted those gentlemen who had lately
lo much zeal for whatever had been far.dtioned by
time, would vote with him. He truitcd the House
would not fuffer the present fubjedl to pass on the '
ademption ol the Minider'g innocence, w::ich M>
nilUr* no doubt would afliime, and again c'si! (â *â inS 'igce with the feoUnei of Cotifcioui iris
. :l;icc. Hit rj'ted cbe house would eater into for: . j
'***"* enquiry on he wasabout to brinj ofecn.
ravening the lawâcharges which he would fl>-
nrr by fu.h evidence, that he would scarcely thin *
. fiat thty woald fuller such proceedings to pass uri
noticed. He had felefted them from many other
;r:iÂ«lcs ol a nature equally criminal, on account of
heir p'.ainnefs and simplicity, and hecoulJ not con
ceive any argument that could refill them.
The mifeonduft of ministers, in this calamitous
-var, formed an ample ground of charge and of rep
robation ; the enormous ex Â»,vagaHce, and culpa
<le mifroanagement of the public money, were also
matters of moll fcrious accusation ; but he (hould
â¢â¢>afs over all these, much ai they merited attention,
*nd confine himfelf to the (ingle charge of hafc'ing
iolated those laws under which the public money 1
% granted,and, having presented to that house falfit i
Accounts, with the view of making it appear that i
they had complied with the provisions of the acts i
Â«>f parliament, and what {till aggravated the fubjeft
of complaint was the violated laws had been bro't j
into that house by the miniiter himfelf. He firft I
< ailed the attention of the house to the appropria- I
j ion aft, by wltich die king's ministers are enjoined I
iot to use the public money for any other purposes 1
han those pointed out in the aft itfelf. They can- i
iot without a breach of law take upon themselves 1
todifpenfe with its provisions, and employ the mo- <
jcy for other pnrpofes ; and fie would confine bim- ;
fclf (imply to (hewing, that after that aft <
lad appropriated certain sums for cloathing the ar- I
my, paying the ftaff officers and lieut. governors a- ]
broad âthe money had not been so applied, nor i
nad account been given how it had been disposed of I
âThe disposition of the money for the army is t
â¢more ftrift than for any other fei vice. It is not '
disposed, in a general way, for the army, but every i
service is diftinftly and fpecifically provided for.â t
In the yeata 1-793 and 1794, certain sums were ap 1
propriated, which, by an account laid on the table, 2
dated April 21, appear tohave'been paid out of rfle t
fcrviee of the pref'nt year. Of these, there was i
644,0001. issued for cloafhing, 146,000!. to thÂ« t
ftaff officers, acd 34,413!. to lieut. governors a- c
broad, all of wlych had been incurred and provided p
for 1793 apd 1794, and were now taken out of a
the grants for 1796, in direst violation of the law, I
and even without giving any account of what has c
been done with the money originally afligned for c
those purposes. His proposition was plain and t
dimple ; there 19 the aft of parliament, and there is a
the account of the 21 ft ofApril, (hewing it has been r
â¼iolated. Ministers could not set up any good de- si
fence on the ground of convenience, or of public tl
â¢ecefiity. In the fituatton they flood, it was their tl
duty to have come to that house to have dated the c
necessity that compeilcd them to a breach of the v
Jaw, and to have a(ked for a bill of indemnity ; 1
there is no dodbt it would have been granted, and la
by this mode of proceeding, the law would have J
been vindicated, and the conftitutioa preferred in. tl
violate. But, instead of doing this, they have en- fl
deavoted to cover one, crime by committing anoth- A
er, to conceal the illicit ufc they had made of the it
money difpafed in the appropriation aft, by produ- b
cing falfe accounts tqih-.it Ijoufe. In their defence a|
will, perhaps, fay, the deviation vvgf iinavoida- I ei
blc, and was judged by former practice, but it was w
â¢ deviation and a practice which had been always u;
considered to be unconftitutioual and dangerous, m
and in all good times,it had been severely censured. pi
In 17H, during a war, distinguished both Wy ex, la
pence and glory, the practice was voted a mifappli- bi
cation of the public money. It is said extraordina- at
ries are unavoidable, and this is true, to a certain d<
extent ; but it is the duty of ministers to submit fe
'air accounts to the house, to (hew in the most (at- li<
sfaftory manner how those eV-aordinaries have
teen incurred, to give an honest statement of the ft;
aft and futuie expetifesof the nation ; andhesftc- oi
d ministers, whether, at a time when they readilyÂ» b:
:ceived from parliament every thing they deman- 4.
ied, and wet? even put in pofTeffion of 1,500,000!. at
ir unfoicfeen services, whether they could not have ce
ade eftima:es nearer the truth than those they had 8;
1 tely presented to the house ? Mr. Grey here de- lii
fcrfbed the rapid increafeof the ixtraordinaties, at
from the time of queen Anne'Â« wars,when 200,000! T
was deemed an enormous sum ; and he particular, w
1;. preffcd upon the attention of the house the ex tr

a member, had also, in 178J, dated, that the prat- oi
lice ol txtiaordiaaries, had been carried to an alar- it
ming heightii, and Mr. Pitt himfelf had then con- tl
â¦lemnad and reprobated the practice in the (Irongeft na
language. But let us compare his former declara- Is
: ions with his profcnt conduct, and we dull find he w
has far, very far, furpafled in extravagance all that p<
ever was done before his time; that he had furpaf- fh
fed r veil (!:c very improvidence of which he had so cr
much complained. w
A j eft ifi cat ion founded on the practice of former p:
t'mts, could not therefore be admitted from him, fe
hp had so warmly condemned that praflire, from di
!im who had (lood forth the advocate of public or
onomj ar.d of reforms, conduct which he re
â¢ >ped had npt been adopted merely with the view ac
f deceiving the people ; and Mr. Grey hoped lie he
ou'd not now contend that no-blame was due di
r taking the money voted for the army cloathing as
~C. in 1783-4, applying it to other purposes, an
a 'id delaying the payment of it beyond the (Ã¼bfe- a *
qarnt year. The sums which fh<Â«uld have been fu!
paid in 1793 4 hnve now been taken out of the lui
rams for 1796 of which no less than eight millions â
3ve fiecn expended in the firll quarter, and arrears
(>1" army cloathing Hill remain. Mr. Grey now
L rrocevded to read the refolutiont to the house. M

2 They firlt asserted, that,at all times, and H
"iler all circtimdances, it was the duty of the his
i>jfe of eOwmoiis to watch over the expenditure of wa
| " public money ; the fccond, that by aft of par- rc
â 'nt-nt it was. provided, that money (hould not be ga'
''pKd to any other purpufs# than those exprefTed hal

si of aticharging arrears
in- for army clothing, llaff officers, See. incurred iii
ler '793 -4, for which money in these years had been
of voted, but had never yet been accounted for. Ht
>n- now called the attention of tbe house to a refolu.
tion passed in 1784, when it was probable ther<
ius would be a diflblution of parliament before the ap
â¢p- propriation aft could be pafled,which declared thai
>a- iny minilUr (hould be guilty of a high crime and
so mifdemeanrir, who (hould use any unappropriated
Id sums without the consent of parliament, and con.
n, tended, that the conduct of ministers fell within the
1 g meaning of that resolution, and that they could not
;y lawfully emplay money granted for the current year
fe in retrofpeftive services. He next proceeded to
at notice the economical reform bill parted 1782, and
Is that which relates to the paymaster of the forces,
ft That bill had two dillinft objtfts: the firft, to
't guard against the accumulation of money in the
â ft hands of the paymalter ; the second, to insure rcg
Â»- ular annual payments to the army.âThis aft has
;d been violated. By an account presented to tha<
es house on the 22d of April of the expenditure of
1- money in 1796, it appears, that there hav# been if.
eÂ» sued to the paymaster of the forces 400,000!. in ex
-- chequer bills, that there remains in his hands a bal
n- ance of 83,2001. This was ft violation of the aft
ft of parliament, which provided, that no balance
r- (hould ever remain in his hands 5 for wltich pur
s' pose it had been enacted, that no money (hould he
tr paid lyr the exchequer to himfelf, but that it (hould
if be paid into his account at the bank, and that he
is fbould draw for it from time to time as occasion
>t might icquire. When firft he heard of a balance,
â¢y in he hatudaof the paymaster, he could not altogeth
- cr believe it ; he supposed it must be in the bank.
) But having often had too much reason to fufpeft
r, administration, he CP' fafrtfd with a pr- 'lenan 011
le the fubjeft, who was capablc oi giving '.um the V'ft
is iiitclligence : that get
m the balance must be
I- quiry he found it wa e
a pavmader to the full s
)f a fubjeft on which hn 1- ar >c ;
r, he eotild fay no more li
is declared that all moi < t-e ac
ir count of the Â» ban.;,
d that he (hould draw far it ' vices
is as they occured, and r
n remain in his hands : r-re .it p -
:â¢ fentcd to this house 1 g
c that 83,20 c!. was in i ; This violation of
r the law vtfas so limple, so visible, that nothing he
c could fay cÂ»uld place it in a stronger point of
e view ; the two facts themselves weie fufneient.
; Ihe second object of that aft had been equally vio
l lated. It had been provided, that on the 24th of
e June, and the 24th of December, in every year,
- the neeeffary sums for the cloathing o! the at my
- diall be ifTued âHe was pofuive, and he had nqw
- fufficient proof, that none had been ifTued from
e midsummer 1793, till December 1795; and now,
. by accounts on the table, dated 1 lit of April, it
: appeared, that these due for 1793-4, had been tak
-en out of the grants for the let vie*of 17516. It
5 wasimpoflible to divine what defence could be fit
1 up for this violation of the paymaster's aft. The
, miniiler cannot here (hew that he is juftified by
. precedent, for the aft was parted since he himfelf
, lafl canje into administration. It was an aft
- brought into parliament and parted under his own
â¢ auspices ; and he arcufed iiim of fettingthat aft Rt
1 defiance, and violating regulations which lie him
felf had acknowledged to he neccffary foi the pub
lic benefit.
â¢ Mr. Grey then moved refohuions, in fflbflance,
; dating, that all money for the use of the paymafUr
â  or the forccs, (hould be paid into his account at the
â¢ bank of England; that in contempt of the law,
' 443> 000 '- I'" heen ifTued by government, immedi
, atfcly into the hands of the paymaster of the for
â¢ ces, and that a balance remains in his hands of
I 83,2001. in dirÂ«*ft contravention of an aft of par
- liamcnt. The lad point to which he would call the
, attention of the boiifc, was the disposition paper.â
1 rhi3 paper, he presumed, was intended to be, that
. which it profefies to be, a real account ; and lie
trusted the house would never admit that it ought
! to be any other. This too had been violated The
â¢ Â«'niftÂ«Â» will f-.Tfts-p, th. of hiÂ«-prer
t deceucrs for this; but this is thÂ« lea'ff a^milTlÃle
- fiom him of all men, who came into power on ex
- puss condition of reforming the abnles of all his !
e predeceflors. Ihe disposition paper, he would
1 prove to be a falfe sccount, and that the provisions i
- of the law had not been complied with. Perhaps '
- it will be said this paper relates merely to ifluesfrom i
- the exchequer, and if the pay ma r tei' can get the â 
I moTu y out of the exchequer, it is of little impor
- lance whether it is applied to the exact service for
; which it was received. If the violation of the dif
t position paper arose from neeeflity, the mtnider
- i.iould have applied for a bill of indemnitv. His
> crime was aggravated by hiÂ® pretending to comply
with the aft, when in fact it had been totally de
parted from. Mr. Grey then moved a resolution
, setting forth, that certain foms, mentioned in the
1 difpafition papers for 1793 4-5, remained unpaid
â  on the Ift of January 1796 ; and his concluding
â  resolution was, that ministers had presented falfe
accounts, calculated to deecive and mislead the
house. Mr. Grey having enumerated his three
'liflinft chargesâ-id, rtfpefting the appropriation
aft ; 2d, refpefting the paymeder of the forces ;
and 3d, reTpefting the disposition paper, concluded
a very clear and able speech, confined entirely to the
fubjeft to which it related, by moving his firft reso
lution. (To be Continued.)

of the best jvater at the door, smoke and other convenient

may be tilled to advantage, fn front of the mansion-house j pato
and in full view, is a moil beautiful meadow of two hun- !
ffred and fifty acres v in which may now be cut one hundred | m l *
and fifty tons of the best Hay, besides affording a fufficien- ur
ey of pasture for the teams, and as much more meadow '
naay-bc easily put in, besides raising a large quantity of; l *
torn, potatoes and turnips. The lands belonging to this I aw
citato consist of about ten thousand acres; on whic'i are 1 j
the Mines for the works, two of which are of the best ! - fl
quality, one, so near that a (ingle horse and cart will bring l j cu
ten tons per day, the other, a team of four horses rhay j ceec
bring fix tons. Besides the above there are several other crs ,
mines of inferior quality very convenient, the iron of i rece
which is good for nails, and when mixed makes excellent I the
castings. The mines are in good order, with proper lev- in t
els for drawing off the watÂ«r, and {hafts at proper dift- 2
ances. Near the Works have been discovered several beds afte
of Bog Ore, and there is no doubt, with a little attention 3
a fufficient supply thereof may# be procured. All the Â£ ro
mines are supplied with proper houses for the miners.
\yithin a mUe and a half of the furnace there is an inex- !
hauftable vein of linveftone ; from whence not only a sup- 1
ply for the furnace may be had, but alio any quantity for ta( -
"building or manure. Within less than a mile of the fur-
nace is about twenty acres of the best double spruce for
beer; and near it is a celebrated mineral spring; and two
and a half miles from the fyrnace, within the tra&, arÂ«
two valuable sites for Forges and Saw-Mills, on an excel
lent itream of water; and two large ponds may be made,
and a permanent supply may be had, by a small cxpence, "
from a Lake of four miles in length and one mile wide, '
and adjacent a fufliciency of wood may be had : near to
oije of the sites is a good farm-houfe, and about eighty a- j
cres of arable land, a valuable orchard, and meadow to f j v
cut thirty tons o[ Hay ; and in the swamp that will form
the pond there may now be cut sixty tons of hay.
Belonging to the fame Estate, and sa\
within three miles thereef, nearer the Landing, is a good
NEW FORGE, with two fires, in complete order and re
pair, situate on Rockaway river, whith furn flies a con
stant supply of water ; adjoining which is a good conve-
nient dwelling-house, with three rooms and a good kit
chcn on the firft floor, and a good barn and stable; also a j
large, convenient Store, which is now kept for the supply ' tin
of the the country ; and this situation is
very convenient for the works, mucti more so than to hav; pn
the dry-goods store kept at the furnacc.
Adjoining to the foregoing Estate,
and within four miles thereof, may he had if wanted, a
â  tra6t of fix thousand acres of Woodland, and a site for a aJI
Forge, on a stream of water very fufficient in every re- p*
fpe6t; together with several houses new built, ani a tradl
of three hundred and fifty acres of fine low land ; a great
