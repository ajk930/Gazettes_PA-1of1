ing out some of the motives which fh '*iM le.'d

'hearers, in an enquiry into their conduct undjr |
such evidences ot divine favor, and-thus con- 1
eludes, with reprefetiting the alarm.ng reverie |
ot circumilanots.
<i Already does danger menace us from ,
L. abroad, undtr the twofold form of open vio- .1
, lence, and the ft:II more alarming, because i
! treacherous, afpeel of insidious policy. So f
.. ' that, in the language of li.tiy writ, fro n (
me " abroad the sword" threatenet!:, Â«vhile "at
ow home there is death." t
LU "! Till within a very few years, the tempe- ;
c , eS: rature of our climate, has proved in the I
' > highest decree favorable tÂ» health, and feÂ» J
! lenity of mind ; and the mortality through- f
~~ out our continent, was scarcely more than
! what accident, or the natural decline of life, â 
j occasioned : whereas new, the frequent vifi- <j
p nr ! tation of Difcafe, in Â«â¢< reoft teriilic form, f<
he defnlates our once flourifhing cities, by an j v
I nualiy bani/hing a great part of their inha- c
; bitaiits from their aecultomed places of;
! abode, and hurrying, with irrefiltible rapid- j'
! ity, very many of those whom negefiity com- '
1 pels to remain, down to the silent chambers n
in of the grave. (ii
j That these coincidently dillreffing cir- oi
:h ' cumftances may not have been infli&ed as 31
a merited puniihment for our violation,as a
people,of the injundions of Christianity, and "
he a gencrifl deviation from religious and moral [j!
"K redlitude, who can with ceitainty deny? f r
IC ' Yet, when we refledt on the attributes of 01
the Deityâthe general economy of his
providenceâthe regular andcor.fi mcd ope- !
"â¢ ration of physical causesâand the history of- dl
mankindâwe ftiould be particularly cauti
:n ous in di.iominating any temporal evil a n<
u- judgment upon the fufferer . : f r
'y The doArine of a superintending provi- fl,
10 dence is indeed clearly inculcated and prov- fp
ed, in almolt every page bqth of the Old
and New Testament, but we are by no ' h
ir.eans either authorized or able to diftin- â¢
- guifh the particular instances of the immedi- f n Â°
ate interference of the Deity ! from the or- â  tu
dinary operation of the eftabiifhed laws of . h<
nature. | m
[Be this however, as it may; it is i afl
A our part as men to commiserate with hu-i p S
11 mility and fear the fufferings of our fflbw j"
mortals ; and while Christian sympathy
heaves_a
d section otour iite catamuy, with all its a fad pr
1 variety of woe," let the benevolent and m
Â° highly meritorious exertions of those of our
k fellow citizens, who voluntarily rifqued their
lives, to alleviate the of their help
less brethren, be "ever remembered by us c &
with the rtloft refpeafui rjletm, and by those Ai
who were the JubjeSs of them wit h the molt Fr
ajfcdiofiate gratitude. As Chriflians, let us th
profit by the numerous examples of mortal- [J? !
ity, and Â« prepare for as sudden and unex
petted' a a arrest, as that which fe many '*!
- have so lately experienced. That we aie |,f,
yet fuffered to farvive, is surely a just and a in
; great cause of thaukfgiving. Human life P*
2 even when protrafted to its utmost extent is ali
: very short, and the mod aftive exertions f "
are indispensably neceflary to secure a bliss
â¢ ful eternity. That the greater our prcpa
ration, the greater will be the degree of our
felicity in the next state ofexifteiice, neither
reason nor revelation permit us tv doubt.

Â»n houf after fun-rife the alarm of fire was '
( Heard. It broke out at the top of a wooden
house near the centre of the town, where
. there were a cluster of wooden buildings, ,
nod three brick buildings, very large. The :

where the nre broke out, and aJarge hoafe
of brick, within about ten yards of the
famefqaare, and belonging to them also, -
were sTiiraculoufiy favsd after being on fire =
several times, and in different places, by c
the exertions of the citizens, which c
(topped the conflagration from extending _

wooden houses, and one large brick house, v
occupied by two merchants, one of whom v

was a deal of grain consumed that was in
