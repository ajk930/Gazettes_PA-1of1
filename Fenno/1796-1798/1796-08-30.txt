QUARRIES .0 be let K
I will rent my mei chant Mill at the little Falls Of Po w
sent towmac, for'any term not Ufs than seven, nor more than
i',i elefcu years, from thejfirll day of September next. The _
mi'il-faoufo iÂ»42 by 40 'eet, three ftorics high, built with t}
ftnne, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, tw6
1 overshot 18 feet water-wheels, and Evans's machinery _
tomplcte, with every otl)er thing propÂ«r and necessary for
Â§ carrying on the business with dispatch, and at as little ex-
penfc as poflible, all in good order.âFrom the mill to my
landing cr.i the Potomac river, (whtre craft, of any bur
then deliver grain and take in flour) it is about 40 31
yards, and from thence by water ti> George-Town and
the City ps Washington, about 3 miles, and to Alexan- Â»
dria about 11 miles. This aided,by a fufficient Is
larf ' capital, will command the produce of a very cxtonfive
trong back country, where large quantities of wheat and other
grain is annually made, the. distance to it being from 8
), to so miles less than to any market town upon the navi
', rS the Potowmac. Tbete are on the yrcmifcs a J
â  large ltonS iip.TTtone granary, and a commo
dious miller's house. At the landing aforefaid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, yrhich is in great for
' wardncfs and probably will be finilhcd the ensuing fall. r
There are alfij on the prcmifes, a Brewery and Distille
ry, built with Hone, in them are three Hills, two coppers
or boilers, with every necessary article, all new, and in ,
good order, and fufficiently large to carry on the Brew- '
0 baj - c ry and Distillery upon a very extensive plan. This prap
is vel- erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
1 tho- Upon my lands adjoining the premiies, and along the '
e lea- banks of the river, where craft may lead with cafe and dis
patch, is an immense qiantny of building and icunda
. tion-ftones. F our quarries are now open, and as many J
* more'may be opened with ease : the stone taken from these J
Â§ quarries is'better, and has the preference at this market, .
' to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries '
separately or together as may btft suit.
On the top of the hill, and about 200 yards fron* the
uguft, mill, is a stone Dwelling-house, large enough for the ac- !
Sally, commodation of a family : also, akitcheA, daity, smoke
house, &c. and a garden, enc:ofed and in cultivation, the J
1 foi of which is equal in goodness to any in this state. I ;
will also rcÃt this property. (
Adjoining to the Brewery and Distillery is a Smith's
olphe (bop, in which is a complete set of Biackfmith's tools, \
which 1 will also rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
s. tenant two negro blacksmiths, one of them is a complete
workman. â¢ \
11 I rent out the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts,
which were built for the purpose of carrying stone : they
will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch. Immediate
poficflion will be given. For terms apply to thefublcrib
er in this town.
J The Mill, Brewery and Distillery, with their appurten
'- - ances, will be daliverad to the tenant or tenants in good
' repair, and must be so returned, at the expiration of -the

Some obftrvaUons in yonr paper (!iew an extrem?
rettlefsnefs under certain paragraphs of letters frotr
England tefpefting the conduct of the H'mfe
j r( ._ Reprtfentatives as to the Briiilh treaty. It is t
able surprizing no doubt that we do find in
laces the EnglilTi prints any threats of war such- as
J e . rc " held up as scare-crows to the multitudeâbut nnthe
lain, contrary, applauses of the firmnef6 with which the
â  ces opponents of t!ie treaty infilled that our wrongs
1Â§ ues should be redrefled before we entered into compadi i
with so faithlcf* a government.
,!0, That the oppofers of the treaty in Congress did
par- not mean to set it aside is evident to all whÂ« are imâ¢
partialâfiom Mr. Maclay's propositionâwhich.
: e(cf was not to RtjiCTbut to sus?enb the execution
ying of the treaty until we h dafluranccs that ourfhips
o,n and seamen fhruld be fafe in futifre, and surely the
bin;- events Â°f'he day fully prove the necessity of this,
for the treat-'has made q,i change whatever in the
gant fla'ecfthe commerce of the United Statesâour
seamen are ft ill heat and infultcdâour ships are ft ill
ie , a l taken and condemned, the accumulated lofies oÂ£
ieve which threaten our insurance companies, our banks
pec- and all our trading people.
( . But if there be any crime in oppofirfg treaties
â when difcufled in the legislative body, what shall we
. fay to Peter Porcupine the champion of a certain
patty, who declares his firm oppofitiim to another
â3 treaty made a number of years ago, of which fpeak
-111 -ing he has this fugacious remark. " {5y the treaty J
for " roadc between this country and the King of
ies, " Fiance, the French na ion is in my opinion no
ere â¢'more illegally of the United States tha" the Chi
..n i pffc a 'e." Is there not an effort heie to set a '
for 'he French treaty in defiance of the -govern- '
merit of the Union, how can this be reconciled by '
>lic the so much famed friends of order, except that a '
ek, treaty is one thing when made with one nationâbut
lu *> quite a diffe/ent thing when concluded with ano- i
ther ? There is however one discovery rbade by
your coriefpondent the merit of whiih is all his 1
â ownâhe fays our feats were not of Britain decla
clating war agamft usâbut unless she would con- 1

l ' ExtraÂ£l of a letter from Wetzlar, June 17.
Herewith you will receive some details of the
battles fought, on the 14th, 15th and 16th, near
our city, and at Altemberg.
On the 14th there wete only (kirmifhes, withbut
ed 3 ny formal attack; yet the French were repulsed
ed from Wehrdorf, Betghaufen. Dillheim and Ketz
iy enfont ; all those places fuffered greatly by their
u- retreat.
of On the 15th, affairs be)?an to wear a more serious
In- afpedt. The French !#jrmed of the reinforce
th ments, arrived for the Imperialists on the Lahri and
be Dill,' intended to force the centre of the Jmpbria j
lifts, which expedition Gen. Le Fehvrc undertook,
with 2j,000 men. He is the fame who comman
ded the expedition of laftyaar in this quarter, Â«nd
is perfectly acquainted with the country. On th<-
15thin the foienoon, he attacked v the Imperialists
lr . at Berghaufen, Wehrdorf, and pushed his forces
â  t> forwards through the woods near those places.' The
3e Austrian Grenadiers, the regiment of Hufiars,
be Veczay, and the Saxos Chaffeuis, just arrived, at,
y. tacked thr enemy ; but the French annoyed these
[- ttajopa by tnad<cd baHcriej crcfted
from Leon to Altenftetten, firing grape shot, where
by the Saxon Cbafleurs fuffered fcverely. t icld
Ma rtial, Lieutenant de Werheck advanced with
v ' e the remainder of his troops, polled behind our ci
ty '.he cannonade betame frightful, the Imperi
'alifts on fevcral points were obliged to give way, the
of rain and weather not being in their favour. We
lived in anxiety, and a retreat appealed to be una
Voidable ; so matters at 7 in the evening,
,n when unexpectedly and like a saviour from Heaven,
atrired the Archduke CharleSj and hattened i'ft full
gallop to the field of battle. During the most terri
er ble fire *of (hot, he rode through the ranks
Is and encouraged the troops, by affming them that
reinforcements weie drawing near. The Imperia
ls liiti now persevered with unexampled bravery. A
few "moments past Imperial troops arrived from
WeiJn-'Uenfter and Nucmheim, filing off to Konigf
berg. At the fame time the brave Saxon ttoops
marched by Rechtenbach to the field of battle, and
te more cannon airived, which the Imperialists ftood-ia
ln need of. Now they attempted to-decoy the enemy
?â¢ fym. his woods : in vain. Then the lmpeii
m al'ft* ercAtd two batteries in opposition, and com
-10 menced a violent canonade. The Imperial and Sax
Â°f on cavalry turned the woods, the infantry charged
the batteries with bayonets and stormed the gaval
ry ranged in the woods, when the French were
obliged to retiie; and by jo at night vhftory
: decided ,for the Auftrians. On both fides many
ie were killed and wou-vded. The grape (hot did
18 great execution among the Imperialists. The Sax
| ons performed prodigies of valor, to them the
T j victory is principilly owing. Many prisoners are
not brQÃght in yet, amongst them is a colonel of ca.
lr valry wounded. Twelve cannon jvere taken. A
'1 lieutenant of the Saxon chaffenrs, the -firft who
c 1 penetrated in the woods, was taken prisoner, and
was found afterwards with his throat cut.
Yesterday the t6th the attack wae renewed and
the French driven from Leun, Stockhoufe, and
e Wcilbourgh. The huflais of Blankenftein crossed j
the' Lahn near Overbuehl, made many prisoners,'
i ana took a cannon.
General Lefebvre had his hand cut off by a Sax- ]
on horseman, and his brother was killed by the
mufquetry. j
The prisoners from Jourdan's assure us, that 3
f thev were protnifed to plunder Frankfort, if they |
e could penetratv' to place. This at firft oc
calioned great alarm amongst the inhabitants. Thus ]
V/e:zlar, Franckfort and their environs were-faved.
3 It was necessary to hasten the arrival of 9,000
Saxons, by an express ; the Archduke led them c
himfelf to the battle.
! From Dillcnburg the brought in yefter
j day a French commissary and seven upon
j whom they found 2Cp louis d'ors.
This-day the whole Imperial army passes the c
. Lahn in pursuit o'f the enemy, the loss of which
is said to be 3000 men.
