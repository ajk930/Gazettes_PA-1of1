HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, January 4, continued.
The report of the committee of Ways and Means
011 the fubjeft of the balances due from indivi
dqal States to the United State* being under con
_ fidcratioru
Mr. Williams recapitulated what he had before said
on the fubjeft of emigration, and infilled upon the rfif
advantage it was of to them in the settlement.
Mr. Gilbert said, before the queltion was finally
taken, he wa'f dlfpofed to make a few obfervatioas
more 011 the fubjeft, though he did uot know that
he should fnggelt any new arguments. From the
apparent disposition of the committee, frpm their
r#fufal to grant any time as requafted by the debtor
Hates, that Mey might be enabled to convince the
Hotife of the iujudice of this claim against them,
{he said) lie could entertain but little hope of suc
cess, by any argument or consideration with the
committee ; he (hould, however, as a duty he owed
ta the general sense of mankind, as well as to his
immediate constituents on that lubjedV, proceed in
| a summary juray to examine Jtirther into the merits
I and propriety of the refolutioa before them, and
fuhmit certain considerations resulting from the
fabjefl, to the reflection of' those who were dif
poled to consider them.
The resolution, be said, was in effect, afTerting a
claim, by the United States, to those balances
againlt the individual liates, and making solemn
demand oflhem for the payment. It would there
' fore be proper, he said, to examine the fubjeft, in
order to be clearly fatufied, against all objections,
'that this was a jujl and righteous claim. And in
his opinion, Mr. C. said, the present was the pro
per mÂ«ment, notwithstanding the opposite feuti
ments exprefled by some gentlemen, for makinjA
the enquiry and ascertaining the important fadL
It would be remembared, he said, that when
Congress m?de provifian to pay the balances claim
ed by the creditor dates, about three years agoj
the fubjeft of these corresponding balances was
prcfented to the consideration of that House,
and underwent a particular animadversion and dif-
It would be recollected how solicitous the
creditor states then were to secure from the.United
Statej provifian for their claims ; and how far they
wese, at that lime, from Hrging or even proposing
the idea contained in the present refeltitioo, ofex
â¢aQing these balances from the individual states. It
would also be reeÂ»lle&ed by many who were then
present, he said, that certain gentlemen frojn those
states, favoured the opposite idea in behalf of the
debtor statesâthat one ef the commiflicners em
ployed in the settlement of the accounts, and then
a member of that House, and who, he said, from
his intimate knowledge of all that bulinefs, was
better acquainted with Its nature and merits than
any other member, explained it, and in order to
prevent any measure like the present, proposed a
relinquifhment of all such claim on the ground of
justice, policy and equity. It would also be recol
lected, he said, that it was considered at that time,
by certain gentlemen of the creditor states, that
such lelinquiftimeot ought to be made; and that it
was particularly so contended by one of those gen
tlemen, then very adtiveas well as eminent en this
floor, and now of the Senateâthat this geutleman
considered the law prefenbing the mode of settle
ment and rule of apportionment (and he was one
of the makers of it) no more than 1 an artificial ar
rangement for effecting a final settlement and quie
tus of that difficult businessâwhich con(truÂ£tion,
Mr. G. said, derived great strength from the aÂ£t
itfelf, as well as from other confiderationsâfor it
was remarkable, he said, that the aÂ£t prescribing
the mode of settlement, without expreffiug any
thing as to exaflting payment from the individual
states, against wlÂ»m balances should be rendered,
cantains express engagement that prorifion should
be wade, by Congress, for the payment of such ba
lances as should be rendered in favor of individual
states. This remarkable omifiion and fiienie of
the aft rtfpeÂ£ting the debtor states, feemcd to him,
he said, strong evidence that no such thing, as now
contended for, was then coinempla'cd. It it true,
said Mr. G. that no such relinquifhment was then
made; but it iÂ» equally true, that after provision
was made for the creditor states, pursuant to the adt
of settlement, no .motion or idea like the one corf
tsined in the resolution before us, was offered ; and
j t,hat, the impreflious arising from the con
| liderations then suggested, it seemed to him, and so
;he had beett, he fafd, in fact assured by others, that
1 no fiich cljl.ii, as the present, would ever be af
j ferted.
! In addition to these obferrations, in reference to
the former impressions entertained upon the lubjeft,
Mr. G. laid, he /hould be glad to fee on what ba
sis this claim agaiijft the individual Ita'.es rcfted, and
whether it were fohd or net. When he contem
plated the state of thiftgs nnder the Â»ld fabrick of
confederation, lie could find he said, no principles
contained in that? com past, to warrant the course
and proceeding adopted, in refpeft to the settle
ment of those accounts, by the present government.
He could perceive 110 fort tÂ»f provision ji\the new
con ft it ut ion, by which cohgrefs could derive, ores
ercife any power of arranging and direÂ£ting the
mode of settlement in the manner they had done ;
and although such proceeding, so far as it, related to
the United States only, might be proper aqd found,
if they contemplated a mere artificial arrangement,
for ascertaining and fettling all accounts, andqui-""
etting those who were creditor states ; yet if they,
intended by such mode of proceeding, to exaiEt the
balances which should be rendered against individu
al (tales also, the procetfding anf) aÂ£t of congtefs as
to their binding influence on individual states, he
considered (he said) quite unconstitutional and nu
gatory. And this consideration also, he said, cor
roborated th<f conftrudtion whish had been made,
that the law us the United States prescribing the
mode of settlement, was but an artificial plan, for
aecomplifliirig an easy and final close of that bttfi
nefs.
To avoid the force of ftiph Ã¼bjeÂ£tion, as wtll as
all other exceptions, belaid, it had been urged and
refptikd, that the settlement had been the relult
of an aibitration between th_- ftat/s, and that this
was the filial award, as repotted by the commifii
oners. But where fir, he asked, was the evidence
>.f such arbitration among the parties ? Where are
their submissions to befaund. He said he had ne
ver seen any- Certainly thÂ« legislature of the U-
Rited States would not he said, consider their own
aÂ£ts competent to such and arbitration,
as must bind all the individual states, uulefs there
was. eXpVefs power given them by the conftitutian
fijr such aft of legislation. Certainly he said, it
was not pretended, that conprefa had any special
delegated authority from the individual" llates for
tha* proceeding. Admitting however, that con
gfefj had been specially authoriz-sd to adt on that
fubjeft by way of 'arbitration, yet he said, palpa
ble error, or mistaken principles tending to an une
qual result, without any frgud or fault in any party,
and much more so, when the unfair com'uft and ex
travagenee of a parry contributed to such result,
would always nullify the award. â¢ On the ground
therefore, of arbitriment and award, he said, the
claim mult alio tail.
The principles of the extraordinary mode of fÂ«t
tlement, the unequal rule of apportionment, their
application.to New-York, with theit unequal epi
lation and effects, he said, had already been fully
explored by hii colleagues as well as himfelf, to the
committee, and therefore needed not again to fee
fpecified.
When we take a retrofpeflive and compara ive
view of the efforts and conduct of the feveraf ftntes
during the revolutionary war, anjl compare it'with
the statement of accounts made by the (.ovnmiflioÃ
ers, and fee the enormous sum placed against New-
York, far beyond the amount Â»f all the sums pla
ced against other states ; at firft blush he said, all
would be convinced, (except those who intended
not te be) that the settlement must have been une
qual, and if fÂ« found a claim against the ttate, ve
ry unjulf. He had said it before, and he said he
would here repeat it, that he did not think there
was a member on that floor, who -w3s acquainted
with the whole btifinels, how gravely soever he
might affe& to think otheiwife, that could in his
confcienec believe the statement made against New
York to be the result of a fair equal adjustment.
In that settlement, he said, was found, (and that
under direction and fan&ion of the law) that while
no charges by New York had been made againlt the
United States, but for general defence, and autho
rised service Jlridty vouched ; there had been allow
ed in favor of other states,, charges and claims of
all forts, as well for private as for general defence,
for unauthorised as well as authorised Services, and
all these whether vouched or not. Was there ever
said he, such an inequality heaid of ? He believed
not. This circumliancc however, afforded convic
tion to his mind, he said, that what had been here
tofore urged, was true, tw witâthat congress canfi
dered it but an artificial arrangement.
For (he said) a these things, with the unequal
rule of apportionment must, and moftÂ»certaiuly
yvere foreleen, it weuld rat otherwise be explained
or accounted for, at this day^âand thetefsre (he
fajd) he gave it that conftrudtion, which alane it
would coujlitutionably and rationally bear ; and
some Â»f riiefe, who were makers of the law* de
clared was its only intent and meaning. To for
tify this conclusion the more, (he said) he fhauld
present another view of thefuhjeft resulting from
the change of politicalfituation, which he thought
defeived feriaus confidcration.
It seemed to him (he said) that gentlemen mis
took the state of things in refpeft ta. the United,
and the individual states, and confounded themselves
with those local feelings and dilpofitiÂ».ii so predo
minant under the old confederation. Under the
old fabric (he said) each state stood alone clothed
with all the rightÂ»-uÂ£-fc>vereignty and means of re
venue. The United States who had incurred this
debt, were refj-ouirbie for its payment, without
the power or means to difchargc itâTo remedy
this defedt, to give all power and means to the U
nited States requisite to fatisfy this debt, and pro
vide for all other exigencies, and to meet all oc
currences, a new compact was formed and lyftcm
adapted. To effect this purpofc, the individual
states ceded great portions of their sovereignty and
all their principal means ef revenue. These ces
sions were more ar less impÃrtant to the United
States (be said) according ta the magnitude and
peculiar lucxl Jxtuation as the state. The cessions
made By New-York in-this refpeit, if not equal
or superior toar.y other, were (he said) of gteat
er value than ftidfe of .one halt of all the other
states in the Union, and served to afford ta the
United States mere a&ual current revenue. And
yet so little grateful or imprefled with manly re
fpeil for the boan, in which they ali participated
alike, (he said) thert,*feemed a mntradmg levelling
defpotilin that was not to be fatisfied, so loÃg as
that state was luppofed to be more wealthy than
ftime of her neighbors. He hoped however (he
said) that liberal feelings and candid reflection on
this fubjeft, would discover the injuilice, the Im
.propriety of asserting this claim against the indi
vidual states ; and that a due confidcration of po
licy and of justice, in reference to the mode of
settlement, and lii-fegard to the conftitutionajity
of the, la vr p efc ibing it, as well as tHe political !
change in the arrangement of the government of
the United States and th? great resources of reve
nue ceded by individual states, when feiioufly con
templated with all the probable cenfequences re
sulting from this proceeding, would restrain the
committee from adopting the resolution piopofed
and induce them to abandon the projedt, as unjuit
and eppreffive, cantrnry to the Spirit and meaning
of the law, as well as the constitution of that go
vernmentâBut if they were inclined (he said) to
adopt it, in order to hear what the states had to
allege against the demand, he was confident New
\ ork would be able to offer good and Sufficient
reason, to (hew that the claim against her was un
just and ill founded and ought not to be.exa&ed.

DOCUMENTS
Which accompanied thevnieflage of the President of
the United States to both Houses of Congrei's,
January 19, 1797.
Letter to Mr. Pinckmy, Mirujler Plenipotentiary of
the United States to the r'rench Republic.
Department of State, January 16, 1797.
SIR,
In ray letters ef the sth and 26th u!t. I feat you
two Notes from Mr. Adet, the Mi liter of ,ie
Frenvh Republic to the United States ; the to m
er dated the 27th of Oitoher, and he latter the
15th of November lalt; and my infwer to the
firft. The latter note embracing nUrr.eroiu topic*
of complaint, and going as far bai.k as the year
1793, required a particular examination ail the
tranfafiions of our government from that time to
the preffint. The other iiidifpqttfable duties of the
office prevented tny entering on this examination
as early as I had expected, and she current bnfi
nefs has retarded the pursuit. The result of this
examination 1 am how, by the dircftion of the
Prelidcnt ps the United States to communicate to
you. This history of out affairs you will tmi sup.
ported by documents, many of which were deliver
ed to you at your departure, and the relidue will
be herewith traÂ«fmitted. The remarks and reason
ings on fadh you will duly appreciate ; aad, from
the whole,joined with your own obfervation6, yoa
will be enabled, it it believed, to vindicate the li
nked States, and to their impartiality
as a neutral nation, their fidelity in the oldlervatiori
of treaties, and their fricndlliip as an ally.
Ihe difcuiDon on which I am entering will in*
volve much repetition ; for tkegeneral queftioimand
particular cales grouped together i h the Mini tier's
last note, have been fubjetis of controveify and
correfpondeuce from May I 793 to this dav. Some
Other points have indeed-feeen contended for, which
the Minilter has now without notice. Why
they ate omitted I know not ; for in these cases
the United States were as ppfitively charged with
violating treaties as in those which he has been
pleased now to detail. Some ol thwm it may be
fouud proper to introduce, to render less imperfect
the view of our relations to France.
The complaints of the Fr'ench minister against thÂ«
United States, have reference ta three principal
iubjc&s. 1 ft. lo the abandonment of their neu
tiai ri'hts to the injury of France,-in not maintain,
ing the pretended principles of the modern law of
cations, thatfree/lips make free goods Ani that tim
ber and naval ftorcs for the equipment and arma
ment of veffcls, are nut coutrabar.d of war.
2d. To violations of our treaties with France e
ven in their letter. '
3d. Tiil the Treaty of Amity and Commerce bet
ween the United States aâd Great-Britain ; which
he alledges '< deprive, France of all the auvanta,ei
ftipulalcd in a prev.ous treaty." A fourth com
plaint iÂ» t. uly ingenious. The fortune of war ha.
constrained some of the belligerent powers from e
nemres, to become her allies ; aad if the alleged
abandonment of the rule of the modern law of na
tions, limsconfequences, works an injury to those
ahies, from that moment France is alio injured.
1 evhaps 1; will be in time to notice this last charge
when the allies themselves complain ; if the answer
to the firft, involving the fame principle, should not
render inch notice altogether URneceffary.
1 fiiail now prcL.it to your view those fads and
observations which will pr.ve,.we con:ei,e, that'
the mini Iter's complaints arÂ« without any iuft foun
dation. J
Under the firft charge, That we have not main
tained, as we ought to have done, our neutial
rights, it is alledged ;â¢
ijL That the pofuion, that frte Jhib,make free
goods, is an eftablUhed principle of the modern
law,ot nations, and that Great-Briuin, by cap
turing French properly on board our vessels, has
violated our neutral rights ; and that unlrfs we
canape! Great-Britam to refpecl those rights, France
will be jultiSed in violating them.
Not to remark on the singular reasoning, Tbat
if one warring pawer commits an adl of injustice
towards a neutral and innocent nation, aiioiher
warring power may lawfully commit the like id.
jultice, we may ask what authority is adduced, to
fl)ew that the modern law of nations has eftablifh
!ed the piiutiple, That free Jhips make fee goodsVatlel fays pofltively that " effe&s belonrmg 'to
" an enfcmy foun I .on board a neutral (hip, are
" fcizable by the tights of wai 1 ." Agreeably to
i his long efta.lifted rule of the law of nations,'
France herfelf, in her marine laws, has dire&ed
tha' the rnerchandiv.it ami rfftfts belonging to her ene
mies -which Jhall be found on board neural vej/'els
jhall be good prixe. By a former law, indeed, the
neutral veflels ihemfelveg, as well as the effects of
her enemies on bÂ«ard, we> e declared to be good
prize. Valin remarks, however, that this regula
tion was peculiar to France and Spain ; and that
e4fewhi?re the goods of the enemy were alone fub
jefted to confifcation. And in the treaty of France
with the city of Hamburgh in 1769, it was sti
pulated that " all effefls, provisions and merchan
" diic whatsoever belonging to her enemies, and
found on board the veflels of Hamburgh (hould
be coi.fifc#ted."
Mr Artet remarks, that one of his predecclTors,
in July 1793. applied on this fubjeft to the govern
nrent of the United S'ates, but was nnfuccrfsful.
He mult refer to Mr. Genet's letter to Mt. Jt-ffer
-8fÂ«, dated July 9, 1793, [the fuhjeA was resumed
in terms Hill meie extraordinary in his letter of July
ajth, 1793,] to which Mr. jefferfon answered on
the 34th, declaring " bis belief that it cannor be
" doubted, but that by the general law of nations,
*' the goods of a friend fpuiid in the vessel of an
" enemy are lawful prize. It is true that sundry
" nations, desirous of avoiding the inconveniences
" of having their vefTels stopped at sea, ransacked,
Â«Â« carried into port and detained, under pretencc
" of having enemy goads on board, have, in many
" inflawces, introduced, by theirfpecial treaties, ano
" ther principle between them, that enemy bottorrts
Â«' (hall makÂ« enemy goods, and friendly bottoms
" friendly goodsâbut this is altogether the cffedl
" of particular .treaty, controling, in fpetial cases,
" the general principle of the law of nations, and
" therefore taking effect between such nations only
" at have fa agreed to control it." And it is
plain, that it was to avoid the inconveniences re*
fulting from this general rule of the law of nations,
that France and the United St/tes stipulated, in the
23d article of their comrriercjfcl, treaty, " That free
" (hips should give freedom to goods ; and that
" every thing (hould be deemed fret which (hould
" he found on board the Slips belonging to the
" fubjetis of either of the contra&ing parties, al
" though the whole lading, or any patt thsreof,
" (hould appertain to the enemies of either, con
" traband goods being always excepted." It is
alto slain that this ftipulatiou was intended to ope
rate (indeed it was its sole objeA, and otherwise
could have no operation at all) when one of the
parties fliould be at war with a nation, or nations,
with whom the other at peace. France,
therefore, has now no right to complain if the
goods of her enemies find protection on board
American (hips, or 1o pretend, that,in order "TÂ»
" reflore the balance of neutrality to its equilibri.
" um, 1 (he may feiie on such goods : the jurt equi
librium between her and the United States will be
reftorcd when we are at war and (he at ; at
which time the geodiof our enemtes.will find pro
tection on board the veflels of her citizens.
2d. It is alledged that we have abandoned the
modern public law on contraband, and by our trea
ty with Gieat-Brftain granted to that pawer exclu
fively the free carriage of articles for the equipment
and armament of veflels.
Here, as in the former ease, the question recurs,
what is thr law of nations on the point in dispute ?
Vaitel defines contraband goods to be " comkjiodi
" ties particularly ofed in war--fuch are arms, mi
" litary and naval Mores, timber, horfee, and even
*' provisions in certain juoitures, when there are
" hopes of reducing the eftemy by famine." In
the treaty between France and Denmark, conclud
ed oh the 23d of August, 1742 â"Tar was de
" clared contraband, together with resin, fails,
" hemp, cordage, mails, and timber fsr (hip biiil
;"ding.'* " Thus, on this account (fays Valin)
" there would have been no cause far complaining
41 of the crinduit of the English, if they had not
â¢â¢ infringed particular treaties ; for of right thefc
*' things are now contraband, and have been so since
" the beginning of this century, which, howevc,
4 * was not the cafe formerly." " The modern pub
" lie law on contraband," mentioned by Mr. Adet
and his predeceflora, probably refers to the princi
ples declared by the armed neutrality? during .the
American War. This tranfa&ion is too remarka
ble to be passed unnoticed.
During that war/ Gieat.Britain and the other
belligerent powers, exercising the rights adored to
them by the law of nations, made prize of enemies
property on board neutral veflels, and of contraband
goods belonging to neutrals. Eageras neutial 11a- j
tions must be to seize the opportunity which war
presents, of becoming the tarrieis for the bellige
rent nations, where (hips and mariners are wanted
for military cpeiatiens, it was petfeftly natural that
the former (hould deiire to establish as a rule, that
frce(hips (hould made free goods ; or in other words,
that neutral bottoms (hould protest the goods on
board, to whomsoever these belonged ; and it was
equally natuial.for them to deflre to diminish the
lilt of contiabaÃd. In refpeft to the latter, it must
have been particularly interesting tÂ® the three nor
thern Bioiitime powers, ftoM dominions
chiefly the other maritime nations of Europe re
<iived supplies of timber and naval (lores, to strike
these from the lift of contraband, or by fomt means
to exempt them from capture.

Difpatehes, of which the following are copies, (bro't

Vica Admiral, Sir George Keith llphinftone, K. B.
Monarch, Saldanha Bay, Auguji 19,1796.
Sir,
I have the honor to inrlofe a lift of a Dutch fquad
on under the command of Rear Admiral Enijelbertus
Lucas, lent hither for the reduction of this colony, but
which were compelled to surrender by eapitulation, on
the 17th inftaut, to the detachment of his Majesty's
Clips undtr my commind, named in the margin*, on
the terms also inclofeit, For further particulars I beg
leave to refer you to the accompanying detail of the
proceedings of the squadron from the 4t)vto the Bth
inft. and I hope the Lords Commissioners of the Ad
miralty will approve the measures I have taken, so es
sential te the Britifli commercial interest in the East.
Ihe ships are all coppered and in good condition,
except the Caflor, wliofe rudder is defective.
In juft'ice to the officers and men I have the honor
to command, it is iny duty to observe, that, in conle
quence of the mod violent tempestuous weather I eyer
beheld, and the very unpleasant fittution in which the
squadron was at limes placed, they chearfully, and
much to their credit, underweul a degree of fatigue
hardly credible.
Caprain Aylracr will have the Jionor of presenting
thei'e difpatehes. I beg leave to mention him to their
Lordfliips, as a rei'peiSable Gentleman and an a<Sive

Sir,
Your most obedient humble servant,
G. K. tLPHINSTON.
Evan Tfepean, Esq.
Monarch, SaldbaHa Buy, Augujl 19, 1796.
Sift,
I have the honor to inform you, that intelligence
was received at Cape Town, on the 3d inft. of a num
ber of (hips having been seen in the offing at Saldanha
Bay, which was confirmed en the sth. In cense-
this 'very preparation was made for putting
te i'/Jpinmediately, with the squadron under my com
nnunl; bin from the Monarch's main mast being out,
and theiefiipeÃuous weather, I was not able to quit the
anchorage in Simon's Bay until the 6th, when we
pffrcefded toTea.
Oil getting under way an officer from thelhore, came
on board t.> ( i ifoi m me thai a number of fails had been
seen the preceding night in the offing, near False-bay j,
I theq refpjve ito ftecrto the Couth ward and weft, in"
expedition of their having taken tfiat eourfc.
i he fqjnlro; continued eruiling in the mÂ»(l
temj rftupiti wea'her I have evei experienced, which
damaged many ot the fhip3, and at one time the
Ruby had five feel water in her hold. We were
joined at sea by his majesty's (hip Stately, Rattle
snake and Echo fiopps. Oil the 12th L returned,
with a frslh breeze blowing .frcm the fpuih east,
upon anchoring in Simon's Bay, the master
attendant Come ofF with information that the ships
seen, consisting os-nine fail, had put into Saldanha
Bay on the 6th, the fame day 011 which I had pro
ceeded to sea ; that they remained there by the last
advice, and that four ships had been difpaiched in
quest of mq to communicate this welcome intelli
gence.
1 immediately made the signal to fail, but the
Crcfcent had got afhorc ; the wind blew strong and
increased on the following day to a perfect tempest,
in which the Tremendous parted two cables, drove,
and was in great danger of being 1011, so that, not
withstanding every exertion, and the n*jft anxious
moments of ray life, we could not get out until
the 15th.
On the 16th the squadron arrived olf Saldanha
Bay at sun-set, and the Crescent, which had been
ordered a-head, to discover information and 10 re
port, made the (ignal for the enemy, consisting of
three ships of the line, three frigatti, and other
(hips, being moored in the bay.
The squadron Hood on into the Bay in the order
of failing, but the night coming on, and the rear
being too far extentjud for action, I judged it ex
pedient to come to an anchor within (hot of th#
euemy's (hips, and perceiving their numbers very
inconfideraWe in comparison to the forces under my
command, T confidcred it my duty, and an imam
bent aft of humanity, to address the Dutch offieer
in command, and consequently forwarded the lcttef
to him, of which the enclosure, No. 3, is a copy,
by lieutenant Coffin, of the Monarch, with a flag
of truce; to this I received a verbal return, that a
politive leply should be sent in the morning at day
break. I was fearful the enemy might attempt to
injure the (hips, and therefore ordered lieutenant
Collin to return immediately with my letter No. 4.
to which he brought back the reply No. 5.
On the 17th, at nine in the morning, a Dutch
officer came on board with a flag, and presented
proposals of teims for capitulation, which you will
observe in the correspondence, with my remarks
and definitive letter ; and at five P. M. the terms
contained in the inclosed copy were ultimately
agreed upon, but it was impofiible to take pofTef
fion of the (hips until the 18th, on account of the
(lormy weather.
It affords me the highest fatiifaftinn, therefore,
to communicate to my lords eommiffioners of the
admiralty, that a squadron of (hips belonging to
the United States, under command of his ex
cellency rear admiral Engtlberttis Lucas, has fur-
to the Britilh force utider ray command,
confilting of three fltips of the line, swo fine In
fjates, twÂ« of 28 Â£Uns, and a flonp of (8 jfans, all
completely coppered, stored and victualled, toge
ther with a large laden store (hip, the names of
which are described in the inclofure No. 6, and the
Britilh ships, to whom they are prizes, in the in
elofure No. 7.
The consequent joy of this fortunate event it
much augmented from the eonfulatory reflcAion on
it's accompli'hmeitt without effufion of human
blood, or injury to either of the enemy's or Britilh
(hips, nÂ«t a single shot having been filed.
T must, however, beg leave to observe, tVat any
refiftaace on the part of the eneiwy could only have
occasioned the wanton facrifite of a few lives; and
I doubt not, that had their numbers been adequate
to contention, their eondu& would have confirmed
the acknowledged merit at all times reeorded to the
martial spirit Â«f fubjefls of the United Stales ; and
I can with similar confidence afl'ure you, that the
officers and men under my command would have
exhibited a conduct equally ereditable to tIK-m
----felves.
The repeated advicÂ»s communicated in your let
ters, refpefiiiig'the enemy's force* dettined to this
quarter, agreed so corre&ly with the intelligence I
obtained by other means, that I have lo'tg been ex
pe&ing this arrival, and was thereby enabled to be
perfectly prepared to receive them, and contLantif
to keep a vigilant look out.
I have the honor to be, with great sfteem,
Sir,
Your most obedient humble servant,

those crediturs : a step which it would have been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
1 he aery statement of the fact therefore must dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindictive." It iÂ»i iginated in a delire to feoure,
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of his juit debts. It was faniSioned by tlie
advice of council as a measure Ttecejfary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjuftiliable condua, no; to the Yub
fcribers Â«'no have merely puWiflied the truth in
terms as mild as the fact would admit, and wl o
mean to investigate in a high court of justice the
validity of thole purchases of which Mr. M'Cle
nachan so confidently speaks.
The lubfiribers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
eaaiion agaiaft purohafing of those grantees 01
either of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
purehafe from any other persons (if fach there be)
to whom Mr. M'Clenaehan may have made firililar
conveyances.
