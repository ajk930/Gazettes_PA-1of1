Fellctv Citizens,
IT hat ever been my opinion that the fuffragei
tain- of freemen, at all elections, ought to be given in
g re- the mod free and utibiafled manner, and, therefore,

for their votes, a pradtice which ought to be dis
countenanced in a republican governmeit, where
eon the inteiefts of the citizens so materially jepend on
the proper exercise of thÂ« right of fuffraje.âBut
Inef- it is also my opinio* that the political fentmentsof i
every man who offers hinafelf as a candidate for '
any office ought to be well known and uaderllood. '

Each of these gentlemen, it it supposed, were paid j th
4 or 500 guineas as a fee. te

long behel*} tiat people trampling, with irrpuaity,
upon the lav* and liberties of nation). But if it
is to he coused as advantage, and estimated as fuc- :
2d fucccfs, weisave a very serious protest against that I
use mode of co lidering it. In the firft place, their I
lei- views of t
llumhr of Brttifa Property, i
oh have been diappointed .n aimoii the "whole, by the <
wisdom and of thi'meafures adopted and t
executed byihr ;
FaHory and the Fket. ;
ho In the next,their aimies have been Hill more weak- f
ho ered and dlprrfed.âAnd laltly, the resentment t
lr. and hatred ps all Italy, have been redoubled and
9*B confirmed. The Brftifr fleet, however, js expelled
an from the 'pott of' Leghorn, and our commerce, aÂ«
eh well as our military lupphes, has been diflurbed and ]
lid diminished in the Mediterranean. If this state of f
;'s things is supposed to be lalting, if the eftablilhment v
Rd of its conquerors is to be esteemed permanent in L
d. Italy, no doubt this acqtiiiition is of the gteatelt f
he coniequence to France, and of serious detriment t
ed and prejudice to Great-Blitain. ']
It becomes necefiary, however, as often as any a
jy usurpation of territory is effected by arms, to con- .f
fh fider its advantages under two very different and a
n- points of viewâand perhaps under a third, v
;d which is the-complicatcd r'efalt of the two others, n
tn Theufesof any conqneft during war, are very dif
a ferent from tta final benefit .which is to arise frotn
es it, fuppofingit to remain with the acquirer in peace
to able jioffeffioD at the close of it. In war, to seize
nt a fortrefs or a bairen rock, is often decisive of its
at fate, or at loft prodpdtive of the great eft advan
ce tages; but the occupation of the most fertile and
rd populous territory, which in peace would enrich
and fttengthen the conqueror, is frequently even Â®
I, hurtful in war, from the force it requires to main-
tain it ; or can only be eltimated as a negative ad
al vantage in the inconvenience arddiliiefs it may oc
>r cafion the enemy. When ihe robbery, however,
â¢y is made from a weak and neutral power, in whose
difficulties and calamities the conqueror has no in
y tereft whatever, even this negative advantage is Â®
s. nothing ; ahd it can only be considered Amply, whe-
d ther the uses he derives from it, 'more.than coun
terbalance the inconvenience of extending and di
d viding his armies. That the French in Italy can-
i, not, without extreme hazard and imprudcnce, thus Â°
), multiply themfelve* upon every point, is evident
from the necefiity they have experienced of with-
â - forces from the siege of Mantua into
d the Milanese, and another retreat, of which we
y have already taken notice, '
The hopes, however, of the impel ialifts in Italy, '
which do not only redouble with these circHtnftan- Â®
, ces, but with the frefh armies they have received
- from the Rhine, are dearly bought with the danger Â®
- which that frontier of the empire has incurred from ')
- the withdrawing of so powerful a force, â¢â and so ne
f ceflary to its own defence aud security. The armies
: of the emperor, outnumbeied and outflanked (not
t withstanding that heroic valour which gilds the
- morning of every combat with success, and yields ai
s only tothe perfeveranceof atiscks & the frelh troops ' c
â - whi.:h the enemy produce in fcrccJEuj) rticfc ai- ''
> inics, we Cay, nave d"HTy"a~ choice of difficulties, " J
and even of lofies ; for it is there where they can- u
, not he, that.the fuperioiity of force secures to the
i republicans thole successes which they call cwnqueils, (t
but which are in fftdt, furrenderi of places, which
the Aultrians are obliged to facrifice for the de- 111
fence of others, which they eHeem more important.
It is the eternal shame of the court of Prussia to at
behold (from a base a jealous policy) these armies,
so dear and so revered in Europe, struggling with
every difficulty, worn down by fatigue, outweighed
1 by the mass of an enemy they always conquer in de
tail, by giving lessons of valour and geneiofiiy to g
Europe, which she is unworthy to rtceive, and too
corrupted to imitate. Does this sovereign forget -
Ik is I German ? or will he reft upofi his arms till
his own turn comes of fubje&ion and insult, and
assume the defence of the common cause when it is
too late, when it i; tfefperate? Upon this fubjett
we ?rc obliged to leprefs ourselves ; the sagacity, Ei
the ientimentt of our readers will leave us in no
danger of becoming obfeure; and besides, there ~
are,men whose very name involves and exprefles ah Oi
t,hat the bitterness of invective and satire can cÂ»n
vey.

rope at this fatal crisis, to'determine i t any price, j;
and with a/iy facrifice, this court to be virtaoui, to St.
