tn Bac'ne's Aurora of lafk Saturday, I e 1 :

an extract of a iett'er from a member of Con- <*

Ved an account that the business of Â«

The \fhole 0 f this intelligence is so noto- v

COMPLAINTS have been frequent p
during the present Session of Congress, re- g
lative to'the reporting of their debates, but c
I believe no speech has been worse, if any, c
so badly reported', as that of Mr. Dennjs. h
The sense is not only in many important, c
particulars greatly perverted, but it is in fe- i
veral parts rendered perfeftly nonsensical f
and unintelligible. One example will fuf- I
sice. Mr. Dennis said that a gentleman <
from Pennfylvar.ia had said, : that it was not i
to be expected that the different parts of the t
Government, like a Clock, would operate f
in perfect unison, but that one part was in- t
tended to differ from, and controul another, i
As reported, it stands thusâ" according <
to an observation mad*, the Government is i
like a Clock, that if one part does not do 1
its duty, the other parts, will compel itâ"
T.he speech has evidently been reported by '
an unfliilful hand, aud.can only be accoun- i
"ted for in this way, th?t as it was delivered i
â mme'diately after the Houf&jvas called, the
bell reporters had not probably taken their
places. . . ' '
The following may serve to elucidate the
opinion entertained by the. Government of
France itfelf, as to the solidity and duration of â 
i Republican Governments in France :
Extract from the Meflttge of the Directory to the
, Councils,, concerning the oath recommended
to be idminiflered to the Ele&ors, dated in
March lift.
" Such is the present situation of the
Republic as to: leave' no doubt that b'oth the
partisans of royalty and anarchy equally
rely on- the approaching elections for the fuc
cefs'of their criminal designs. Each party
is striving to get their accomplices elefted.
Tliis plan is developed in the papers found
on the late conspirators. On the other
hand, liberticide-writers preach up openly,
ROYAL ism, invite resistance to the laws, and
heap obloquy, calumny, and on
every thing connefted with the Government.
They publish and disseminate apologies for
the Emigrants ; in short, the retue tic
may be faidto become a problem, and to
judge from the audacity of its enemies, we
MAY BE ALMOST PERMITTED TO DOUBT
OF ITS EXISTENCE."
COMMUNICATION.
IN the debate in the House of Reprefea
tatives on the answer to the President's
Speech, and in the course of discussing the
defenfivc measures proposed by Mr. Smith of
south Carolina, it was said by the French
party that France hat nothing to fear from the
Untied States.
France, it may be seen, has to far,
iftly. The deprivation of those supplies
of various kinds which she has heretofore
received by American veflels, and through j
the medium of American merchants, and ;
which are ejintial to the prosecution of the j
war. I
2dly. The clamours of her allies, Spain j
and the United States, from the injuries ;
they must experience, should she oblige
them to adopt similar measures to those she
is pursuing.
3dly. The critical situation to which she
will reduce Spain in particular, should she
drag her into the war, considering that the
fate of the Fl*ridas and Lguifianq depenti up
on her retaining the frioidfliip of the Uni
ted States. _ / â¢;
4thly. The certain loss of the Weft In
dia i(lands from a want of our provisions,
and intercepting their supplies, which mult
inevitably throw them into the hands of
Great Britain.
What, on the other hand, have the United
States to fear from France ? It is not pos
sible, that, in the present situation of th*
French Marine, there can be, ffJred from it
1 detachment -ad.quat: to m -ike a i>p'iinpref- i "
fioH or.~tfce United' States, feould the mea- j
tures of defence .reeorwnended by the Exe- ;
cutive be adopted-. It is well known that j
(he â ennnot furnifh a fleet to protefl hsr Weft '
India islands ; can she then fend a fleet that ' h
could materially distress the Uni.ri State; ? i
Admitting h<jivcvei"that (he may nwke :

THE ANSWER. \ !Â»"
w
>tAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY.
YOUR address to the Legislature gives "
.great fatisfadtion tothe RepresentativeS, and
e'xeites the molt pleasing expeftations from t,o
, your adminiilration. With pleafurp do we &
offer you our congratulations on being elett- J?,
ed the First Magistrate of this Common
: wealth. An appointment equally honorable t0
; to you, and our conflituents, as it has pro- oi
. ceeded from a just estimation of your cha.- G
I t after,.
It is the Angular felicity and high privi- el
lege of the people of the United States, w
: to live under conftitution9 of government de- v.
j liberately frapned, and solemnly eftablilhed c:
g by themselves ; which are administered like-
. wife by men of their own choice. The fe- (.
i curity, the freedom, and the happiness
t which ihefe conftitutionshave afforded, can
. not fail of having produced an nniverfal affd
. strong attachment to them. The unrivalled
profperky which our country has enjoled,
for several years pad, is undoubtedly much â
to be ascribed to the eftablifliment of the set
deral government, and to the wisdom, and c
t purity of its tdminiftration : While we re- *
- gret that the beloved and distinguished fellow ,
t citizen who presided over that adininiflrati- t
, on has retired to private life, where we trust t
. he will continue to enjoy the blessings of his c
t. countrymen :* We are happy to recognize
- in his successor, citizen of Massachusetts, j
I so eminently confpicuoua for his talents and ;
- his virtues.. His long ekperience in_ politi- i
i cal life ; his approved integrity and patriot- 1
t ism ; and his great abilities justly entitle him 1
e to the highest esteem and confidence of his (
e fellow-citizens'. Our relation to foreign na- ,
- tions appears critical and important. The i
. unjuftifiable depredations which have been 1
$ committed on our commerce by the Bellige- ,
s rent Powers, and particularly those which
o have recently proceeded " from a great na- ,
'' tion whose friendfhip we highly value, and
y whose happiness we have not ceased to wish
i- for," cannot be'cortfidered without the mod
d serious concern. On this interesting occa
e fion the President of the United States has
ir funimo'ned the National Council, and point- ;
ed out so them for their consideration the
. rm'funderftanding which unhappily exists bet
e ween the Goverriftietlt of France and that of
if this" country ; " ami has fignified his intenti
f on to institute further negociation, in brder
if possible to effeft an accommodation upon
honorable terms. 'To those of your excel
',e lency we unite dur fervent wishes, and we
II cannot refrain from addingour confident ex
n peftation that theft overtures may be cro'wn
ed with That in the magnanimity.
Ie of the F re nch nation, and in return for ni
just and liberal policy on the part of our own
| y government, we may find indemnity for the
c _ losses we have sustained, and a restoration of
the haimony and good will which formerly
subsisted between the two republics. To_
1( j the wisdom of our national government the
er people have afligned the consideration and
decision of this, with their other important
1( j national concerns, and we are confident we
3JJ speak the language ofour conflituents, when
we fay, they consider, in anjt reverse of for-
0 * tune, a firm support of their Federal Gov
1C ernment as the sure, the only means of eo
to joying and securing their national happinefs
,E In any event they will never be separated
T from the government of their choice. The
rights and liberties, the freedom and inde
pendence of America, have been dearly pur
chased, and will never be surrendered to a
ny power on earth.
tj. A cheerful fubmifiion to the laws, and a
t' s readiness to support the civil magistrate in
he the constitutional and legal discharge of his
0 j duty, is indispensably incumbent on every
citizen, and is the only method by" which
! lc we can receive the full benefit of our free
and happy political institutions. The esta
blishment- and encouragement of such inftitu
ies tions as -tend to diffufe ufeful knowledge ;
ire tÂ° promote industry, religion and virtne is
gh of the firft importance and we doubt not of
nd | your ready co-operation in every measure
he ' that may subserve these valuable purposes.
1 The" enjoyment of a free government effenti
lin i ally depends on the enlightened morality of
ies â¢ its citizens; While exercising our thoughts
ge ; and everting our best abilities to establish the
Hie peacS and promote the prosperity of our
country, we trust, we shall never be unmind
fhe fulofjour dependence on the Supreme go
vernor of tlie Umverfo,- no;- of his signal in
thc j terpofitionsi in behalf of the United States,
up. but ever acknowledge them with heart-felt
ni- ! gratitude, and look up to him for wisdom
jto direst us in all. our measures. Your Ex-
Ia- : cel'tncy will permit us to add, that enter
ins, | tafningan X'gh sense of your fitmnefs and
uft ! impartiality, we repofe'fuch implicit confi
of i dence in your assurance, that in your civil
| and military appointments, so important to
ited the prosperity of the Commonwealth, you
>of- ' will invariably consider virtue, attachment
the ! to the conflitution of our counti-y, and the
n it , love oforder as aaiong the firft qualifications.

THE NEW DEPUTIES IN

As the manner in which the Legislative 1
Body of France is compofcd, must naturally
have a powerful, influence on the conclusion
of a general peace, and" as in this '.point of .
. view it appears to us-important to Know the
f. charafter tkroew eledted deputies, we in

â¢ exaft description of the irroft prominent
' features of their charafter and former, fitiia
j tion.
fleurieu (ci-devant chevalier) was a mem
-1 ber of th acadejny of sciences at Paris ; one
- of the most able officers'df the ancient royal
â¢ navy, and minister <of the marine under the
4 reign of Louis XVI. who-appointed h?m
e tutor of the young dauphin. He is a man
e of known honesty and modei-ation. His
- brother Mv de la Tourrette, perpetual fecre
r tary cf the academy of Lyons, perished in
r the riiaffacres commit ted in that town.
ffiuriuais (ex-count) who, as well as.the
former, has been appointed a member of the
council of elders, is pot to be confounded
with" the chevalier de Murinais, his brother,
y ex-member of the'right fide of the conllitu
i eiit of assembly, who at prefect resides jn
- London,
The new deputy, formerly colpnel of the
n regiment of dauphin infantry, and afterwards
Marechal de Camp, has always displayed in
â > his conduct prudence, firmnefs, and mode
e rate principles.
Debonnirres, eledled member of the coun
cil of five hundred, was formerly .one of the
e aioft virtuous, honest, and able advocates of
d the ci-devant parliament of Paris, and was
y ilniverfally refpefted. â  .
d Emmery, son of a Jew at Metz', and coun
r- f e llor in fhat town, was at firft one of the
most Violent members of the left fide of the
d constituent assembly., But tin his feeing that-
V assembly degenerate into a fadlious body,"his,
revolutionary zeal .began to slacken, and he
j- \v-js afterwards considered as one.of the most
moderate deputies of the left fide, and he
has ever since belonged to the-clafs of citi
zens who wiih for the return of peace and
ie order. 1
is Gfuatremere de Quincy is known by the
c " part he afted about 18 months ago, at'
>' e ] iea d of one of the fe&iorts of Paris in the
ie a ff a j r of Vend'emaire. His good conduit
ie C aused him to be condemned to death by the
f-1 sanguinary tribunal which the direftory
j ere tied on that occasion. But he was after
wards honorably acquitted by the lawful and
constitutional tribunal, which the public
a opinion forced the direftory to charge with
a- the revision of his trial. He is the author
1 > of several well-written letters against the re
-31. moval of the mafttr-piecCs of the arts out of
fts Italy, a man of chaca&er, and amateur of
3n the fine arts.
5Â° As to Boijfy d'Anglas, likewise elefted
deputy to the council of fi\e hundred, both
at his zeal for the return of good order and the
moderation o"f his principles, are too wed
known from his past conduct in the
le " tive body, to need any comment.
on The choice of these deputies clearly IheWr.

LONDON, April 25. _ I
A letter from Milan of the 21 ft ult- writ
ten by a gentleman of known refpe&ability, r
ftr.testhe following particulars refpefting the
fcandaleus conduft of the French generals v
in Italy, whose virtue and generojity we hear C
sometimes extolled in the most entiiufiaftic r .
strain :
" The French owed the Venetians about
28 millions for grain, cattle, &c. as the in- .
habitants ef. the Continental Dominions of .
the republic of Venice had ehiefiy furnifhed !
these articles, the French have discharged 1
this debt by bringing about a revolution in J
these provinces,, which are likcu'ifc sure to
be pillaged in the fame manner as Lonjbar- '
dy. Immense contributions will be imposed '
as the price of liberty ; public arid private
property will be plundered, and all young '
men forced to enhft or fly, that in the latter '
cafe their eflateS may be confifcated. Buona
parte, at the time he signed a treaty of peace '
with the pope, invited againil his holiness
the duchy of Urbino, wffich has lately been
revolutionized. After having induced the
grand dukfe of Tufcany to pay four millions
ps livres on condition of the French garrison
being withdrawn from Leghorn, he has
ordered it to be again occupied a
â¢whole division. The very moment the llate
of Genoa had ransomed itfelf, all its fubjefts
who poflefs any property in the Imperial
Fiefs, were crulhed with taxes. Prince
â¢ Doria has-paid 150,000 b'vres ; and the
Fiefques, the Balbis, and others, have been
saddled with enormous sums.
Biwnaparte has extorted from Lom
bardy 130 millions in money and merchan
dize* without taking into the account the
spoliations of churches, the pillage of pri
vate property, and the robberies committed
' with arms in hand. Three lours were fuf
ficient for general Maffena to seize 011 the
Mount of Piety and Milan, containing pre
cious effefts to the amount of *IJ millions of
livres, and on the chests of the. hospitals,
communities, &c. The fame line of con
was obfervediy the French generals at
.Bologna, Modcna, and Ferrara. All the
.'.furniture of the archduke Ferdinand, at
Monza, has-been pillaged. This prince had
removed a considerable part of his effefts to
Bergamo, a neutral totvn ; but Buonaparte
ordered them to be carried off by force, and
a piece of furniture worth 583,000 livres,
with which the late queen of France had
presented the archduchess, has fallen to the
lot ps his wife.
" Salicetti has by these means raised a
fortune of four millions; Buonaparte, a still
greater ; and all the other generals and com
initfaries hive coUe<ftcd considerable wealth.
" In addition to the robberies committed,
Buonaparte has received considerable sums
from Genoa, Venice, and the pope, on his
promiiir.g lo.fpare them._ As to the dircÂ£l
contribution in money, has paid
upwards of 65 millions. As,the capital in
circulation did not amount to more than 2 5
'millions, it became necelTary to discharge the
f oaiinder in merchandize, plate, arid with
money boirfowed at Genoa; Count Litta,
after having paid livres, has.fled for
fearof worse treatment, and count Grepi 11'
to pay 900,000 livres. All tlie inhabitants
of Milan had. been ordered, cn pain of cofl
lifcatiSn and baoilhmenf, to return to town,
and now the permifiioato withdrnv to their
villas is fjM them Â£br 4000 livres,per month.
Marchell, tlie ct!<britsd â¢ finp;i , having re-
fufed to appear on th- was ordered by J
Buonaparte to quit L om bardv within three
days, and not to return on oain of death."

fufficient force to pursue General Loudon,
and marched direftly to Clauzen. The ene
my, availing themselves of the means of de
fence which the country afforded,had made
the best diipofitions. The attack was warm,
and well concerted, and the event long un
certain. The light infantry clambered up
inaccefisble rocks, the nth and 33d demi
. brigades of'infantry of the the line in a
clcfe column, commanded by Central Jou
[ bert in person surmounted every obstacle.
The enemy'# centre being penetrated, they
. were obliged to give way, and the rout be-
came general. We made 1500 prisoners.

HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES, | '
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 14.
Mr. Reed, from the Committee of En- 1
rolment, reported the bill for preventing J
privateering, which the Speaker iigned ac- I
cordingly. t
Mr. N. Smith, from the Committee ap- >
pointed for the purpose,. reported a bill to
prevent vessels taken by foreign powers, <â 
from ever after receiving new Registers, ex- 1
cept by the original owners, but, though !
possessed by citizens of the United States, '
be considered as vessels of a foreign power. 1
Mr. Potter, also reported a bill for autho- (
rizing the President, during the recess of <
Congress, to provide gallies, or other vef- 1
fels, for purposes therein mentioned. i <
Both these bills were twice read and com* '
mitted to a Committee of the Whole to- '
morrow.
Mr. W. Smith said the Committe of ,
Ways and Means had received some docu
ments from the Treasury Department,â
which they thought ought to be printed for
the use of the House ; they had therefore
commifiioned him to alii leave to have them
printed. Agreed.
The . iioufe again refolded itfelf into a i
Committee of the Whole on the fubjeft of
fortifications, when
Mr. Allen moved to add a clause* to the
bill, to the following efleft, viz. "to em
power the President of the United
to authorize the Governor of the State of
New 7ork. to expend a certain sum, not
exceeding for the purpose of fortify
ing the ports and harbours of the State of
New 2'ork, provided the sum so expended
be placed to the credit of the said State, on
â¢account of the balance found due from,that
State to the United States, and provided
that that State cede the right of jurifdic
: tiori of the places Upon which such Fortifi
' cations (hall be erefted, to the United
States."
" Mr, Brookes opposed the motion, as be
ing particularly pointed at the State of New
7ork.
Mr. Havens proposed an amendment to
at, which was to make it apply generally to
all the debtor States, instead of confining
it to the State of New 7~ork alone.
Mr. Harper seconded the motion, and
Mr. Allen conferited to have it incorporated
in his proportion.
Mr. Skinner advocated the motion, and
denied that it operated in a particular man- â 
ner upon the State of New Tork.
Mr. S. Smith was in favour of the mo
tion. He wilhed the business of fortifica
tion to be gone into effectually, by securing,
every principal port in the Union, and not
that final! sums- (hould be (pent here and
there which could produce no good effeft.
If he were Secretary of War, therefore, he
(hould think it bed to expend the whole
75,000 now proposed to Ve appropriated,
on the' fortifications on Mucf-Ifland, as he
did not think any particular exigency at
present called for partial measures.
Mr. Williams agreed with the gentleman
last up, that attention ought to be paid to
-all the. fnportant ports in the United
States ; of course he (hould be in favour of
the amendment ; and he did not doubt but,
rather than be continually stigmatized with
being debtors, the State of New 2vrk
would consent to lay out the a (Turned debt at
the Narrows, thu' he believed, they would
not like the way in which the business had
been done.
Mr. Brookes was opposed to the motion,
as the debtor States would be deprived of
, all advantage from the 75,000 dollars ap
propriated ; he also infilled that the debt
said to be due from the State ps N- T'ork
. to the United States, ought riot to be drawn
into the prefeut discussion, but if it were to
j be considered, it \vould be proper to let the
. fubjeÂ£l (land alone. To do othervvife was
5 making an odious diftinftion to the difad
. vantage of New 2'ork.

_ qu
Capt. John Barton, /rom Cadiz, has fir,
politely handed us the following :
Hts Britannic MajeJl/jJhip Captain,
ess Cathz, iitb April, 1797
Sir,
In consequence of the unprovoked Decla
ration of War from his Catholic Majesty &-
gainll his Britannic Majesty and the British
Nation, it is found right that Spain (hould .
no longer have any trade.
I have therefore the honor to acquaint
you, that no neutral vessel (hall hereafter be jv
fuffered to enter or leave the port of Cadiz,
without having obtained my permission or
that of the Commander in Chief of the '
Britilh Fleetâthat from this moment Cadiz y
is to be considered as a Blockaded port. â , a
I have the honor to be, &c._ - T
HORATIO K^LfeONv
To the D?ni(h Consul, '- , .
NEW-YORK, June 14. -' T,
Yesterday afrived here the (hip America,
capt. Baxter, in 45 days froirr Cadiz.â. .
Capt- Baxter informs us, that the Spaniards
were fitting out in that harbour, a fleet of
33 fail of the line, besides 15 frigates, and
7 fire-lhips, with the greatest expedition, â¢
insomuch that the workmen in the" nayal
â yards and on board the (hipping were work
ing double tidesâthat the newly appcinred
admiral Don' Mafferado, was a great favor
ite with the crews, to whom he had been p
peculiarly kind, in recommending an entire ' n
new dock of provisions, &c f and an advance
of 30 dollars per month, which the Gov. 1 !
erpment complied withâthat .this Fleet was
,to be joined by 7 French and 7 Spaniih-fhips
of the line from Cartliagcna, and that when
this jupftion was. made, they were determi
ned to attack admiral Jervis, and drive him
from the Mediterranean, or perish in the at- "c
tempt. It is said that the King of Spain I
is so highly incensed against a number of the 1 J
officers of the late fleet defeated by admiral (
Jervis, that he is determined to puni(h them <
1 severely. The Santiflima Trinidada v/as
' nearly ready for sea, and is to make one. of i
[ the above fleet. It was said thewhole would
' fail from Cadiz in 20 days.
' On the 26th April, capt. Baxter passed
' through the fleet of Jervis, who were
L then blockading the po* of Cadiz, consist
: ing of 22 fail of the line arid 5 frigates : he
* was ordered on board admiral Parker's (hip,
' when, after a ftritSl examination, was per
mitted to proceed. The firft lieutenant of
Â» tjie (hip informed him that before the fleet
' left Lilbon, the Portuguese had sent an am,
" baffador to Paris to treat for peace, and that
1 he expe&ed they would not p erfhit the Bri-
I tifli fleet-to enter their ports for the future.
