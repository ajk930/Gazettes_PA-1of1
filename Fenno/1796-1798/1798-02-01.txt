dreadful afthrna for about twenty-three years. I

traublefon ein thfe night; and used to discharge an
almost incredible quantity of glutinous matter
ironi my lungs ; and my breath wasfo exceeding
itcrt that I could not walk across ray room. Pro {

also a memfcer ; and any of them will gladly fa- V
tlasy any inquiry concerning the truth of what I

MR. VElf no,
In Porcupine's gazette of the 1 it'n of Ja
nuary 1798 I observe a paragraph, which
states that the communication made to you
sometime ago from Virginia, that th* coun
cil had refufed the public bell to the Federal
Judgf, is dated to have been incorre& . as
your correspondent, the author of that com
munication, conceives himfelf in duty boand
in order that you may not appear improper
ly committed, to give you a statement of a
few of the faft. If Potcupine's "best p'of
fible authority" meant that no order, refuf
ing the use of the bell was entered on thi;
journals of the council; so far he is I be
lieve correft, at least, T have understood so
from more than one of the members of that
body. But, if he meant that the keeper of
the bell received no such orders from the
lieutenant governor, who, it is understood,
considered himfelf at the head of the Exec
utive, from a supposed interregnum, and
which were acquiefctd in by several of the
members, he is certainly very incorre&, as
may be known by application to the judge
who, if he choÂ£e, could entertain you with
the circumstance of one of those very hon
ourable gentlemen's waiting on him for the
express purpose of offering apologies.
TRUTH.
N.B. Should further contradictions from
" best possible authority " appear, I (hall
consider mvfelf as bound to give a full state
ment of the business with the names of the
several aftors as it is understood and believ
edTn Richmond, although it is not my with
to particularize.
Elegant Extract.
From a volume of Sermons publilhed lately,
called *' 7he Scot's Preachert'
" Twice had the fun gone down upon
the earth, and all as yet was quiet at the se
pulchre; death held his sceptre over the
Son of God; still and silent the hours pas
sed on: the guards stood by their poll, the
rays of the midnight moon gleamed on their
helmets, and on their spears; the enemies
of Christ exulted in their success; the hearts
of his friends were funk in despondency and
sorrow; the spirits of glory waited in anxi
ous suspense to behold the event, and won
dered at the depth of the ways of God.
At length the morning star, arifiog in the
east, announced the approach of light; the
third day began to dawn upon the world,
when on a sudden the earth trembled to its
centre, and the powers of heaven were (ha
ken; an angel of God descended, the guards
lhrunk back from the terror of his presence,
and fell prostrate on the ground ; his cpun
tenance was like lightening, and his raim
ent was as white as foow; he rolled away
the stone from the door of the sepulchre,
and fat upon it. But who is this that Com
eth forth from the tomb, 'with dyed garm
ents from the bed as death? He that is glo
rious in his appearance, walking in the
greatness of his strength! It is thy Prince,
OZion! Christians, it is your Lord. He
hath trodden the wine press alone; he hath
stained his raiment ifith blood; but now as
the lirft born from the womb of nature, he
meets the morning ot his refurre&ion. He
arises a conqueror from the grave; hr re
turns with blessings from the world of spir
its ; he brings salvation to the sons of men.
Never didthe returning fun usher in a day so
glorious! It was the jubilee of the univcrfe.
âThe morrsing stars fang together, and all
the sons of God (houted aloud for joy; the
Farther of Mercies looked down from his
throne in the heavens; with complacency he
befetld his worl<^ reflored; hp few h:s walk t
th'ftt it was gooij. The'i did the defart re- u
joice; "the face fcf nature was gladdened be
fore him, f>fthe Eternal de s
fcended as the (Jew of Heaven for the refrefh- <
ing of the natiens." *

pigeon seemed mueh convufed, and some fymtoms
of recovery were perceptible in the child. From
this happy appearance the remedy was continued
for near three quarters of an hour, when the
infant completely recovered andthc pigeon became

CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Debate on Foreign Intercourfi.
[Continued fronj yÂ«fterday's Gazette.]
THURSDAY JANUARY ZJ.
The house having again resolved itfelf into
a committee of the whole, on the bill pro
viding the means of Foreign mtereourfe,
and Mr. Nicholas's amendment being un
der consideration.
Mr. Nicholas rose, expe&ing some other
gentleman would have opened the debate, he
said he had not held himfelf in readiness to
enter upon a reply which he felt himfelf call
ed upon to make to a number of observati
ons which had been brought forward on the
present occasion.
He had been represented in the course of
the debate, as beingj'n favour of monarchi
cal governments, rather than republics, and
as faying that republics were more dangerous
toliberty than any other fort of government. .
The gentleman from Maflachufetts had a
stonished him, wheahe declared that he had
begun his speech, on introducing the moti-.
em to-the house } - by-ftafciÂ»g that republics
were more liable to corruption, aud more
unfavourable to liberty, than despotic mon
archies. He could not have supposed that
such a position could llave entered into a,py
perfon'smind, and he was &rry to think a
ny member should have deemed it necessary
to" go into arguments to prove the fuperiori
iy of a republican over a monarchical govern
ment. He was surprised that arguments
like these should be brought forward in -an
swer to any thing which fell from him : be
cause if there were a man on earth exclusive
ly devoted to,republican governments, it was
: heâfor he would fly from a monarchical go
vernment as far as the earth would give him
limits. " -
[ The gentleman from Maflachufetts, (Mr
Parker) had ftatqd that the republican fpi
| rit had continually overturned monaicKies.
' He knew it; and he would find nothing in
his sentiments, which stated that republics
were more liable to corruption than monar
chies: but that republics were more liable to
be destroyed by an excess of influence in the
executiveâand he said so again. ,
He was not so much surprised that the
i gentleman from Connecticut should have a
[ vailed himfelf of the opportunity of mak
. ing a declaration in favour of republican go
: vernment, by mifreprefentmg whit he had
. said, as hitherto he had given no fubftanti
t al proofs of his attachment to it. He said
by misrepresenting, because he had stated
him as faying that every thing was to depend
upon feeble minorities, in opposition to ma
, jorities. The word feeble minorities could
, not be so distorted. What he said was, that
i it would not be in the power of a feeble mi
. j nority to attraft the public mind to the dan
; ger, by which the government should be
- threatened, in cafe of the corruption which
: he predicted as pofiible to exist. It was to
r j this appeal to the public mindâto the fen
s J timents of the people over their misguided
! representatives, which he considered as the
I fafeguard of a republic, to which he allud
- ! ed. That gentleman had no apprehension
- I from feeble minorities; but he feared the
. ! sense of the people should be awakened to
; ' the abiifes of power in the department he
: had alluded to ; for, it was the theory of
, gentlemen opposed to this amendmen, that
s it was not right tÂ« the departments
. of government; and that the people ought
s not to trouble themselves about the executi
, on of its measures.
A colleague of that gentleman's (Mr.
- Dana) had charged him with addressing the
' galleries, rather than the members of the
, committee. Upon this fubjeft he wished to
â  be understood. A clamour of this kind had
- frequently been raised. He was, ready to
- confefs, that he wished what he said not to
s be confined within those walls, but to go
, beyond them, andproduce an effeÃ upon the
: public mind; and if thÂ» doors of the house
i were to be shut, and there was no chance
â  of his sentiments going abroad, his feat
e should be vacated to the firft person who
e would accept of it.
But it was said that what had fallen from
- him with refpedt to the liablenefs of corrup
. tion to creep into republican governments,
n was a serious attack upon the republican
. system, itfelf; but he believed those gentle-
II men who were continually flattering the fyf
e tern, and thereby deriving the people of a'
s proper caution, were greater enemies to this
e system of government, thao those who ad
fifed caution 3 gain ft undue encroachments th<
upon it. l ar
Gentlemen had fa id, that the effett of this pr<
amendment could not be what he declared tic
it to be, to operate at a distant time,, and th<
not immediately. The gentleman from foi
Delaware had said, this could not be the Pr
cafe, except a new clause were to be intro- pa
'dticed. Thi3 he knew, but there would be fix
no difficulty in it. This difficulty had arif- tn
en from the want of caution in the drawer be
of thefeiH. Gentlemen concur in consider- an
ing this provition as for a permanent eftab- gt
lilhment, though the latter appropriation ed
was introduced rjiertly as a temporary pro- th
vision. It was origina.ly so introducedâ a
but having been repeatedly fanftioned, as an
the gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr. Har- co
per) had declared it had, it ought now to pi
have been considered equally permanent with (h
the other.
It would be understood, Mr. N. fuppof- ve
ed, by many persons who heard of this de- d<
bate, that there was a party in that bouse j fl'
who were diflatisfied as not being likely to ly
get any office under government, and that, p<
therefore they were determined to obftruft tc
governmental measures as much as pofiible. fu
Insinuations of this kind had been made, and fc
they would not fail of gaining credit with c<
some people. His motive was sntirely mis- ei
understood. When he complained of the vi
President's confining his appointments totof- rj
sice, to men of his own opinion, it was not fr
because he wanted offices either for hirdfelf," tÂ«
or friends, but bteaufe hÂ« beli.ved the mea- U
sure would produce serious mifchief to the tl
public. Nor was it of any change of prin- h
ciple that he complained, because he believ. ei
ed it was no new praftice; but it was be- w
cause it held out an improper temptation.â tl
It said, â¢â¢ Come and aft with us, and you t
will be entitled to office." tl
The gentleman from Sautb-Carolina had
acquitted the fnpporters of this amendment tl
of wanting the offices for themselves ; he e
called them paltry, and unworthy of accep- a
tance. He dated their ambition as going v
farther. Nothing would serve them but e
popular applause, and to have the direction v
of publis fentimcnt. He considered this fl
house as a theatre, upon which members t
adled for public applause. For his own cart n
he did not think he poflefled a talent for pub- f
lie speaking; but if the house were to be si
Considered as a he thought that gen- Â«
tleman himfelf would make the moil confpic- a
uous' figure upon the stage. f
But the gentleman added, that this ela- c
. moar of opposition bad existed inother coun- a
tries, and would continue to exist. It had c
existed, he said, in England many yearsâ t
and this, he supposed, was to reconcile this j
country to it. The fame predictions with f
respeCt to the exceflive patronage of the Ex- J
ecutive, Mr. N. said, had been made in that v
country, but disregarded. And he recoin- t
mended that they should now be disregarded *
meaning, he supposed, that the people, of t
this country would be contented to be in the t
fame situation with the people of England, t
But if there was something in the situation i
of that country, which every unprejudiced Â«
man must think would have been better a- ]
voided, and which would have been avoided I
if the clamour, which the gentleman fays is >
common to all countries, had been attended 1
to. in due time. This was an argument i
which ought to induce the people of the U- t
m'ted States to attend in time to this clamour. 1
Not that all clamour was to be attended to,
but he doubted not but the people would be '
able to discriminate betwixt that which ought <
and that which ought not to be attended i
to. 1
He considered the fubjeft of this bill as <
one of the most important that could come i
before the legislature ; for he attributed sll I
our misfortunes to this source. He tho't <
we ought to have no political connexion t
with Europe ; but to be confidered,,in rela- '
tion to that country, a3 mere buyers and '
venders of their manufactures. With res- '
pest to this government, the power con- >
tended for, which would empower the ex- <
ecutive to fend ministers to every court in <
Europe, was every thing Read the con- â¢
ftitutioa, and fee what was committed to it
and what would be its power, if this doc- i
trine xpere to prevail. It would be the <
/crew which could' raifeor fink the govern- ]
raent at its pleasure. Was the declaration
of war an important trust âand would it i
not be in the power of the executive, if the
ground contended for was established, to !
bring the country into such a situation, as 1
to oblige congress to declare war ? At pre
sent, there were few people who did not 1
trace our situation to causes growing out of '
our diplomatic establishment. There wasa 1
difference of opinion, it was true, as to
the condnft of the executive. Some tho't 1
it perfeCtly unblameable, and proper ; oth
ers declared it not only to be improper in
itfelf, but intended to bring the country to
the situation we are in. It was not impor
tant for him to enquire into" this business ;
it was enough to shew that the President
had at any time the power of producing
this effeCt, when he pleased, and whether
it wai done by design or accident ; it was
the fame thing to the country. Perhaps
the aCtors in the business were the only per
> sons who did not attribute our misfortunes
[ to this source.
I He believed we were placed in such a fit
i nation as always to be liahlc to be thus in
i volved from our commercial connections.
: The commerce of this country would al
ways create a partiality for Great-Britain ;
the exteafive credits which were obtained
from them, and the continual extenfioit of
> that trade, would constantly operate that
way. It would, therefore, require Confid
i erable caution to prevent too el-ife a polit
. ical connexion being formed with that coun
, try.
I But it was said there was no danger, and
. that in this question, the constitution and
- the people were on one fide, and the faÃton
t or the supporters of this amendment, on
s the other. If this were true, he owned
- they ought to (lop here ; but be uuderftgad
the constitution as fpeafcing a -cry different
language, and lie thought th*t gentleman
produced thi* doftrine merely by conduc
tion, in oppoGtion to the plain meaning ef
the instrument. The constitution provided
for the appointment of miniftrrs by the
President but it only gave him the power
partially because their falar.'es were to be
fixed by congress ; that part of the consti
tution which declares that no money (hall
be. taken from the treasury but by law, was
an efTe&ual check upon that power. Xan-
not be plainer. If it was dtouht
edÂ» whether the constitution, by giving
the power of appropriation, meant to give
a power over the thing to be provided for,
another <;laufe of the constitution would
convince- The constitution fays, "no ap
propriation for raifiiig or supporting armies
(hall be for a longer term than two years
âThe power hereby meant to be given is
very little doubtedâhe had never heard it
denied bymbre thai) one gentleman on the
floor of congress, and two or three private
ly, that ft was to put it into the
power of either branch of the legislature
to reduce the military establishment, by re
fufing appropriations.âlt is clear, there
fore, that in making appropriations, the.
constitution understood that we fhonld ex
ercise a discretion over the thing to be pro
vided for. Those who advocated a contra,
ry daftrine, did not adduce their argument
from tht constitution. THey barely afler
ted that it was lb, and that those who would
not believe it were diforjanizers. Mod of
the gentlemen opposed to the amendment
hid insisted that the fXecutive had the pow
er of checking the legislature, but that it
was not the intention of the constitution
that the legislature Ihould check the execu
tive. This stood upon no better ground,'
than " it is so, because it is so."
The gentleman from Delaware had said
that that house had no check upon the ex
ecutive, because his powers Were defined,
and theirs were not. The queftioo was,
what is the definition of the executive pow
er ? They were endeavoring to afcertaiu
what it was, and whether that house was
not a check upon it, by having the power
to refufe appropriations. But the gentle
man had said that the house could not re
fufe to appropriate for tke salary of the Pre
sident or chief justice. Surely nothing
aould evince the weakrtefs of gentlemen's
arguments more than the introdu&ion of
such as these. Every one knew the house
could not refufe to appropriate for the fal-.
Aries mentioned, for this good reafoa, be
cause the constitution forbade them Vi He
thought that the reverse conclusion was the
just one ; that when power was taken away
fn particular iaftances, it was left in the
general. The part of the constitution
which forbids congress to appropriate for
the military service for more than two years
will (hew the power meant to be given by
the power of appropriationâVery few will
: deny (he never heard it denied by more
than one on the floor of congress, and two
or three privately) that it .was intended that
i either brancho'f the legiffatuje flieuld have
. power to reduce the military establishment
i by refufing appropriations, aYid yet noth
i ing is said but that the appropriation (hoald
I recur every two year*âthe inference is per
fectly olear, that the power of appropria
tion gives power over the .thing to be pro
vided for.
, He thought it was neeeffary that the ex
tent of gentlemen's doitrine "should be un
derftqod âThe constitution fays, no
1 shall be taken from tfye treasury but by law;
byt gentlemefi fay, the Preifident has pow
i appoint foreign ministers; and to call
upon the house for appropriationsâthey
[ have before told the hoafe he "had.the powÂ»
er to make treaties, and that when made
i they couid not refufe appropriations to car
ry' them into effedh So that he not only
I had the power to appoint ministers and
make treaties, but to command the treafu
â  ry to open at his will. Suppoie the Presi
dent and the senate were to make a treaty
i offenfive and defenfive|(and they could make
. a treaty of this kind as well as any other)
would not congress be driven into a war by
force ? So that not only the keys of the
r treasury were taken from them, but tbe
. power of determining the important quef
i tion of war, if these do&rines refpefting
the power of the executive were founded.
; The theory of gentlemen deserved serious
> attention. They tell the committee that
each department of government has a cheek
within itfelf, but that they have no check
t upon each other. Bow this theory was to
f be fupportrd. he could not tell, except the
i different departments were never to touch
> each other in the exercise of their functions ;
t or, when one approached the other, thajt other
. was to give way ? How was the check of
i departments to he avoided ? He could not
> underiland it. It was well known that the
- Legislative, Executive and judicial depart
; ments of government ran into -each other,
t The partition between them, if any at all,
r was extremely tbin, and would not pre
r their coming ia contadl. â¢
s But if it were possible that the do&rine
s (hould be correft, what would jt lead to !
â - The departments of government were not
s to check each other., Why not ? One of
the reafon3 afligned was becatife.they have
- not the meens of information in their hpnd,
. and therefore could not judge ,<lf. what was
i. proper to be doÂ»e by their co-departmentr.
. All agree that the power of th< executive
; may fee abused ; if (o, heafked, yrhere w.'S
d the check against that atjjÂ»fe ? If not Ycfticd
if in that IwSuie, in the power to grant or rc
it fufe appropriations as they fie proper, where
- was the check? Was it in the people i Had
they more information with refpeft to owr
i- foreign relations, or were they in -other ref
pefls, better calculated to dctermirie the a
d bufe than that house ? Or did thÂ«fe gentle
d nun impress it upon their constituents as a
n duty, to exercise this kind of guardianship
n over the executive ? If this were" enquired
d into, he believed that gentlemen used tbe
d fame kind of /oporijlcif at home, as were u-fed !u that lioufc. " All 'yrÂ»nr irtereftJ are : w,
fafe ; nothing can be doae-amifs in giu'ern- I fu
ment without fame departrtent difcovring of
tlic mifchief:" As he believed, therefore, 'in
the people were not direfled to be upon the fin
watch, aÂ«d as they had not better informs- 3u
tion with refpe to executive measures than foi
that house, he saw no reason for transferring go
the business to them. Nor could the people he
â  co'treft the evil by eleftion, as they had not tb
the knowledge of facls upon which it Was ; it
neceflfy-y to aft. - . |A"
Was it true, Mr. N. aflced, according to ; fe<
the pra&ict of the government, that the de- th
partments hÂ»d no check upon each other? to
Did not the judiciary consider the aSÂ» of in
the Executive and Legislature? Certainly
they did. There were inftancet in which the ex
judges had decided upon the constitution
and laws of the country, and in one instance, be
he believed they had determined for then, f r<
and in another against them. in
Would gentlemen fay that We had bo foi
power over the approptiatioM now under
consideration, in relation to the ability of
the country to afford it, and the fatisfaftion
of other public engagements? If they did j,j
lay'fo the consequence might be great dif- tb
order in the finances, and the power of the th
execdtiVe would not only go to force appro-
pria'fions, but to compel taxation.-Â»-If they a "
admitted that in this refpeft the haufe of w
representativeS had power, it was putting ; n
the exercise of their constitutional duty or. a p C
most precautious footing: If the fame thing
wa9 Forbidden er permitted, according to hi
the mot" e which induced it, there could
be no doubt that the legitimate motive might fc
alwayÂ» be afligned. ar
But it was said there was no need of g
checking the Executive, because the Senate fu
was ieheck upon it. This was no check re
with refpeÂ£t to the office, it only related to t "
the person appointed, and here the power
was equally interested. The only difference tl
was; that there were more wills to COtrftih f c
in the Senate. c<
But it was said the doftrine which he ad- q
vo'cated was novel, and imported, He tho't 1
he had obviated the objeftion by producing f
tke debate which took place at the ftrft eft a
biifhed of the Diplomatic Corps; and he re
ferred to the opinon of a gentleman who n
lived at a time when Party had not appear- b
<d to influence the opinions of men, who 1
said that it was competent for Congress to l '
fay whither ministers Jhoiild be sent, and
whither they fhoHld not be sent. And he j
could fay for himfelf, and his country- t ]
men (for he never heard a different opinion si
in Virginia) that he never had an idea that o
the house had not this power, and therefore 11
had it not to learn from any other Conntfy.
But the gentleman from Maryland said yes
" terday, that the do&rine was not only nov- f
el hot that it had been decided-againft in t
three or four inftanees. In the British i
Treaty, he said, the house decided against r
the power to refnfe an appropriation. If v
sixty-seven members who voted on the occa- |
fion, did not understand their votes, that f
might be the cafe ; but he believed that t
would not be infilled upon. The gentleman c
was equally unfortunate in the other inftan- 1
ces he adduced, Â«sin none of them had the' '
question been decided against.
But it was said, if even the house had the (
power, it ought not now to exercise it, be- ,
cause the neceflary information beinglsdged (
with the Executive, they could not form a |
proper judgment upon it. He believed, 'â¢
however, the house had -a right to all infor- '
matron which related to fubjeils upon which '
they were called to atl. But the commit- t
Ke had fufficient knowledge on the fubjefl, t
to determine there could be no connexion i
between this country and Prussia, to render ;
aminifter oeceflary there; for no gentleman
had even coojedtured an use for such a char
' after at that court. He agreed that it was -]
the duty of the President to carry on the ,
details of foreign correspondence, where the t
Legislature determined to have ministers,
but he did not believe his power extended '
beyond this. But with refpeft to inforÃjg- '
tion, even the body who were called upon (
to concur in the appointment of ministers, (
had no more than that house. The mere t
nomination was sent to the Senate, without i
any thing more than the general reasons for
the measure.
The gentleman from Delaware gave a
clue to the conftrudion of the constitution,
whitii he did not mean to attach to the gen
tleman himfelf. f He said that the executive
department was one which required support 1
in order ta preserve Jt; because the heredita- 1
ry chief magistrate of Great-Britain, with all '
the patronage h<i pofleffes, would not be a
â¢bie to (land against the House of Commons ,
if it were not for the members of venal bo- 1
roughs. Thi9 doftrine was a little strange,
and when he heard gentlemen hold such
high uotions of executive power, if the ft rift .
letter of the constitution wÂ»uld not support
the doftrine he contended for, there would
be a strong temptationto stretch it, to coun
teraft what appeared to him so repugnant
to the spirit of a republicsff government.
He was told that he had introduced very
unnecefiary topics into this debate, and that
the increase of power and patronage in the
President, had nothing to do in this ques
tion ; but gentleman must allow, that if he
â¢ finccrely thought, that the power of deter
mining what Foreign ministers (hould be em
ployed was in that house, and he saw them !
etnployed where they could be of no poflible j
â  use, that he wasjuftified iu bringing forward
the difeffffion. But it vyas said, the power ;
was so small, as to be unworthy of notice :
hut he supposed so far as the appointment
to office was goDe into without necessity, it j
â  was for the purpose of patronage. It was
said, however, that this patronage was not j
Â«nhcjentto ground an alarm upon. Were ;
theytihen to wait until the mifchief was
done i It would be too late, when the tyf
tera was completely matured, to cheek it.
It eould only be done <t its commencement.
And when gentlemen saw that one of the
objeftt oi government had invariably been
to increase officers and faLries, there was
i was fnOk'ient Canfe. for alarm. Biit it TaÂ»J I
I further fa.'d, that if there was danger out ; '
of the wails of that hottfe, there vraa none j ,
'in the legislature!. He did not mean to in
sinuate that majorities were produced by in- t
Silence. He tilled if measures were brot I
forward, which were inimical to the puolic
good, they would be rejefted as they had '
heretofore been. He believed however, that j,
this business of Foreign Intercourse were Â£
; it continued, might become dangerously in-<
j fluential on the legislature itfelf, as they had
; seen, from what had r already taken place, I
that persons for thjfe appointments, were e
to be fele&ed from men of a certain opinion f
in that body.
But no injury, it wis afTerted, could arise from '
executive influence, unless the office was perma i
nent. Ah executive upon a f<tur years lease, 1
could do no harm. Mr. N. did rot know that
being in office only four years, prevented him j
from uling his influence during that time; and H
in.proportion to that influence, would be his ef
.: forts to retain his fituitiem. He was net faying j
that these things had really happened, but that (
â  they might be reasonably expelled to lake glace. (
The committee .were told, however, that ambi- j
tipn was only a Tegiflative property. He thought, t
he kad made concessions enough, when he said j
that legislatures migh: make encroachments in j
this-way ; he believed history would uniformly j
(hewjthat executives had never failed to aim at 1
an increase of their power. f
: When he was up before, one of the reasons ]
which he gave, for reft raining the diplomatic i
i intercourse, was, that men only of a particular
i political opinion were appointed to office. Ma- 1
; ny of the gentlemen who oppo/ed this motion, '
, ! had acknowlededfhe faft, and were afraid on
[ ly, that it might not always b# observed. If
this were the cafe, the appointment to office,
1 could operate only to corrupt the public opinion,
and influence the elections of the country. Â£Mr
' Dana desired to know to what extent, he con
: fidered the executive determination to go ] He
; replied, that he understood that no man was to
, be entrusted with an office who had found fault
r with executive measures. This had been seve
ral times declared, though it was true, the gen
" tleman from Maflachufetts had endeavoured to
' foffen the business by fuppofmg that certain offi
ces would be excepted. He laid, he would cn
- quire inio the operation of this determination,
t The gentleman from Penafylvania (Mr. Sit-
T greaves) said, it wasperfeflly jult,as the prefi
' dent must think himfelf fight. He agreed that
this principle ihould go as far as it eould ; but
" the gentleman must acknowledge, that it was
3 not* constitutional idea, that theprefident must
- be right. The constitution provided that he
3 should be tledled every faur years, in orderthat
j the people might judge whether he had ailed
2 tight or wrong ; for the Englilh doitrine,
" that the King can 'Jo no wrong,"'was not a
e dopted in this country. Upon the principle of
* the president being always right, it had been
n said that he ought not to appoint ministers whose
t 'opinions would Militate against their duty. But
e hs might differ with the gentleman with refpefl
to the extent of this opinion. He did not him
felf know, that it was necessary, at a time when
we were desirous of peace, to have a secretary of
' state, whose manifeftoes were calculated only for
n the eve of a war, and who seemed to be hurry
[l ing on as if it were considered that he pofTeffed
| most merit who was moll aitive in promoting a
Â£ war, Heagreed, that when a perfon'a opinions
difqualified hire from duly executing an office,
the president w.ould aft right in hot appointing
1 such an one ; but he understood the determina
tion to extend to all offices, which was profe
n cuting one half of the people of America, mere
i- ly because they have thought fopi* of the exe
e, cutive measures wrong. Such a resolution was
equallyjinjuft and ilMberafffince it was not ner
ceffary that a colleAor, * military officer, &e. in
e order duly tÂ» perform his duty, thould have an
*" opinion dire<sfly eorrefponding with that of the j
d chief magiflrateoftheUnit<;d States. Ifthisprlnci
a pie Were to be carried into the judiciary, could
1 ) a man whom government cafled a diftrgamier,
r _ expedl io find justice in a court formed of such
materials ? Ihe only operation of such a prin
ciple in offices where particular fentimenvs were
not neceflary to the execution ef the duties of
the office, must be the corruption of public opin
n ion, it tends to destroy the freedom ofeletflions,
; r as well of the president, as of the legislature.
n If gentlemen think that the president of the
United States cannot support his office, with
out a patronage similar to that of the Kihg of
ls "England, they are right in wilhing for an ex-
IC tension of this-influence j but he could not agree
ie to yield it, because he had sworn not to do it.
s, The example of England ought te be a fufficient
J warning to rhe people of this country, how they
fuffer theii> executive to become corrupted j for
the ahufes of that country would never have
" been borne to this day, had not the people been

a WEDNESDAY JANUARY 30.
n From the journal of yetterday's proceedings in'
' congress, it appears that the buSnefs whiih took
1 place .-.fter the doors were dosed, was as fellows :
'e ThehouÃ being cleared, Mr. Sewallflated, that
â t he'+ad keen informed, in a manner which left no
a . deubt of the truth "f the fail, that, in the pref
(jj ence of the house whilst G.tirg, Matthew Lyon,a
member from the ftÂ»te of Vermont, did this day
a " commit a violent attack Â«id gross indecency upon
US the person of Roger Grifwold, another member
0- if this honlÂ°e ; and, in order to bring the business
e before the house, that he had prcpareda refoluiton,
which he read in Ms place, and delivered at the
' clerk's takle. A question was then taken in the
" following wor <1 s :
rt " Does the matter.so communicated require fe
ld crecy.
n . This motion pafled enanimoufly in the negative,
and the jgdleries were opened.
The hotifs then proceeded to consider the motion
made by the member from Mafiachufetts, wfcich

committed on the person of Roger Grifwold, ano

It was moved that the resolution be referred to a

The motion being negatived, the -fcnfe of the
honfe was then taken upon the main qu'edion, as
originally offered, and it was carried The honfe
adjourned about 8 o'clock jn the evening. -
After the journal was read this morning,
Mr. D. Foster reported a' bill for â¢.*(â ' relief of
Lucy Clark, which was'twice tfead and committed
sot to-monow.
The Speaker desired meÂ»)bers to prjpare their
ballets for the eleflion"of Three managers of the
impeachment against William Blount, which re
mained to be eleijed" ,
Mr. Pinckney hoped the house would now a(l
---jourh,' in order that the Committee of Privileges
might proceed in the business which had'heen com
mitted t<Â» them, as"lt wasdefirable that it should
bedifpofed of asfoon aspofhble.
The motion for adjournment was put and nega
tived. 4 to 33.
The house then proceeded to the eleition ufthe
three managers, and the votes having been collec
ted, Messrs. D."Foster aad Jones were again ap
pointed tellers ; and having counted the votes, re
ported as follows :

NEW-YORlCjanuar/, 31.
On Monday cvenhig last, the new Theatre
Was opened to the most overflowing house
that wa* ever witnefled in this eity.Though
the commiflionets have been constrained to
open it inan unfiniihed date, it still gave high
fatiafa&ion. The essential requifitei of fee
ing and hearing hare been happily attained.'
We-do not ever remember to have been in
j any Theatre where the tietf of the stage is
: so complete from all parts of 4he house;â¢-
' where the aftors are heard with such diftinft
nef?. i I
The house is made to contain about 2000
persons. , The audience part, though want
ing in those brilliant decorations which the
artists have deiigned for it, yjtexhibited a
neatness and limplicity which were "highly a
greeable. The ttage was etery thing which
could be wiih'ed. The scenery was execute
led in the most maftfrly style- The exten
â¢ fivenefs of the scale upon which the fcens
are executed ; the correftnefs of the designs
and the elegance of the painting, prefeated
the most beautiful views which imagination
can conceive. The scenery was, of itfelf,
worth a visit to the Theatre.
The company are k,nown to the public;
and they played with great spirit. We in
deed think it the best company of comedi
ans which has as yet appeared on the boards
of any theatre in this place; and we presume
they will this season, receive an uncommon
(hare of public patronage,
r Great credit is due to the Meflrs. Man
gins , who were the architects of the honfe,
for their ikilful and commodious arrange
i ments: and too ntÂ«ch cannot be said for the
. fcienceof Mr. Ciceri, as the-machinift, and
1 for his taste as painter. They are ar
tists who would do honour to any country,
\ and are a great acquisition to this.
Another robfcery, we are informed, was
committsdthe night before last, at. the house
! of James Temple, esq. on the Greenwich
road, by 8Â«or to persons: and we are fur
ther informed, that some circumstances at
tending it, to strong iufpicions that it
mnft have been perpetrated, or instigated,
1 by persons /who had a more accurate know
' ledge of the situation of the family than
p could have been attained by general iparau
r ders.
1 A little after 8 o'clock last evening (fays
the' South, Carolina Stat? Gazette of Janna'
, ry 13,) this city was alarmed by the cry of
f fire. It commenced on the weft fide of U
nion-street, in the house of M. Ejigland.
', The night was calm, wind at. S. W. but
the danger was formidable from the great
number of wooden buildings adjacent.
, Three or four houses, besides back build
> ings have been burnt; the particular loflics,
we have not learnt. â¢

' reverse. Io vour gazette of this evening, you have
given a crreft statement of the faÂ£U relative to this
bttfiuef*, as I learn from ftveraj'iburcea oPauhentic
testimony. A rtioft unmanner'd ruffian has offered
Â» Mr. Griswolb an insult never to be endured. With
a pre fence of mind pot to have ,beeo expefted from
, his strength and {\>Â»rit, but highly honorable, he re ?
framed from iWrfciug him' to his fret, even to the de
' ftruciHon of that refpeft and order which ftiould ever *
be observed to the Representatives 6\ America. The j
' House have taken, as they ought, the affroot upon {

then, fktsll be so 101 lor indifferent to their own dig- {

been offered to a public body; or if they ihall be so \
funk in the filth of party and difhoiiour, as still to
- fufirr this beast to fit ametig them Â«\>on equal terms ; j
s it is to be hoped Mr. Griswolb wiil not fuffer so
; base an example to influence him, or restrain his re
sentment, As I yon has received every species of in
sult, and been used to nothing else all his life, from
f the days ofr his fortitude to his highest e altation ;as
J diftionor and contempt have been hc4p-d upon him
for yean without etfeft, or any excitement of feeling ;
r it must be taken for granted that he has no feelin? for
e such punifoment. - His viis and worthlefacur.ale is all

be made to that I therefore am of opiuion 'hat Mr. ,
Griiwold should most inflexibly rcfolve to beat this
fellow daily and every day, until Â«ne or the uhe* of

Capt. Meany, of the Rose, from the
ie Isle of France, informs that the fleet under j
a Admiral Rainier, eorupofing the expedition
a " against Manilla, had set fail frÂ»m Calcutta ;
but meeting with .the loss os-three of the

failing of two lirge'frigates, and several
firaa'ller vessels of war for Porto Rico, with
several transports with mÂ«n and flares; a
packet from C6runna, and a paqket for
Cadiz. This fleet was driven back three
days after by a gale of wind' from the north
ward, except one of the frigates, which
was cast away en Salt Key ; the men and
