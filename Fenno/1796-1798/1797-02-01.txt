NEW-YORK, January 30.
A bill lias been debated in the Assembly (but no
qneftion taken) for felling tothe New-YÂ«rk Bank
all the fiz per cent (lock of this state at par, or do
mir.a! wthle : 'the purcTiaie ttior.tr to f.i pi:d JBc?.
and] the bank to pay 6 per cent iÃteieit half yearly
on the 6 percent stock, and die fame intereli oh
the deferred stock after the year 1800.
A bill is before the Senate far the gracl I abo
lition of flsvery, and another for improving the
criminal police of the City of New-York.
It is already published that the bill for granting
relief to the fufferers at Savannah has been rtje&ed
by the Assembly of this State. On this occafian,
it may be proper to state that thefum of 5
dollars was raised by fubfeription in Philadelphia,
for thorfufferers in Charleston by fire lalt year.
Confiderahle sums were raised inÃahimore and. oth
er towns for the fame humane purpose. The-Le
giflature of Pennsylvania have granted 15,000 dol
lars for the relief of Savannah ; but not a billing has
been sent from New York, one of the 'icheli states
in the union. Yet in Charleston, which had fuf
fered five times more than New-York by fire, in
proportion to its numbers and wealth, no sootier
was the late fire known in Charleston, thin ajiublic
jÂ»ropofition was made to enquire whether any per
son in New-Yoik had been reduced ta distress, and
if so, to open a'fnbfcription immediately for their
relief. The fact is stated without a ceramtÃt.
The French Directory have written a letter ef
condolence to the mother of Gen. Marceau, on the
death of that brave officer.
From a Charleston paper of the xo:h inftint.
A gentleman of this city has received a letter
from his friend lb the Havannah, which mentions
that Mr. Thomas Mnir, one of the gentltrtien who
were transported to Botany Bay by the British go
vernment, about three years ago, had arrived in
that city a short nine fnice.
The account he gave of himfelf was, that he elu
ded the vigilance of his keepers at Botany Bay,
and got on board of a vefTel which carried him to
Nootka Sound ; that he v. ent amongst the Indians,
and, after travelling nearly the whole length of the
weft coait of America, he got to Panama; and
there he made himfelf known to the governor, who
sent him across the Isthmus of Barien to La Vera
1 Cruz; from iheuoe, he was-fent in a Spanish fri
gate to the Havannah, wheie he expe&ed to get on
1 board an American vefTel and reach the United
' States, but unfortunatly fer him, a letter was feat
by lire governor of La Vera Crur to the governor
1 of the Hayannali, in which he mentions, that tho'
. he had shewn Mr. Mnir every civility in hiÂ»J>owrr,
yet he thought that a man pYofeffing his principles
â¢ would be dangerous in the Spanish dominions ; â 
iherefore+ie recommended his being sent to Spain!
. for the king to determine what should be done with â 
i him. After being a few days at the Havannah,
he was committed to a prifdn on the north fide Â©f
3 Cuba, called La Principa, where he is to remain
' until a proner conveyance offers to carry him to
Spain. His confinement is not rigorous, and eve
.l ry indulgence is shewn to him that is not incompat
ible with his lituatien. The gentleman who writes
- the letter containing this account, conversed with
Jj Mr Muir, who was much disappointed at not meet
ing an American agent there, as he had hoped,
thro' his interiefiion, to be relesfed, and be permit
ted to fail for this continent.

berlind, and Luzerne, it is declared, that taking pos

clause, will warrant any such inference. It contem
plates merely a special Uw, viz. that where any two H
Jlutes may have adjusted the question of jurifdittion,
as far as refpetSlsthe lands claimed by them, and the j
grants to the lands are claimed to have originated pre- I P'

Other persons, I well know, are propagating a
still more visionary scheme, of a second trial, on tht j ai
merits of the original controversy. In the ordinary jtl
cases of private property, the laws recognize a right
to a second trial, under certain cireumftances, and j
therefore it may be had. But in the cafe of a great 1
national question, it is both trifling and ridiculous to j
talk of it; more especially as the ionftitution, in con
formity to -witiek vlic ttiilhath bren had, explicitly de- I
blares the judgment of the commissioners ftiil be " si.
nal and cosclufivc " I ''
But perhaps you will fay, why are these obfer- J ti
nations made nrw, and why are we at this time, called j a
upon to execute the a& against intruders ? I
I answer yon candidly, gentlemen. Very alarm- d
ing reports are ever-, where spread, and have reached j j.
the government, of surveys made by men in armsâ I
of whole townlhips being laid oiF under an a;]umed j v
aathorityâand that a land office has been opened in (
the county, for the avowed purpose of granting war
rants and dilpofing of lands, in direA opposition to I a
the laws ana government of Pennsylvania. _ ! |
These are high charges, and of very serious im- t
port; and there is too much rcafon to believe that there 1
are those amongst us, of desperate charaifter and views, 1
who are fatally bent upon the mad scheme of a fepa- 1
rate Jlate : and t â  attain their objeift, scruple not the |
use of means whii.h invariably lead to war and blood-1
Ihed. I
I befeeeh you, gentlemen, to eonfider eoely, I
whither these meafmres tend. We will venture to I |
calculate, without the spirit of prophecy, what will I
be the result, in fpitp of the fanguint praje&s of a
few deluded state (peculators.
It is impofiible to believe, for a moment, that I
littleJVnfe â¢Â»Â«! in as to I
fuffer an enterprjze like this to facceed. Every
member of that body, cannot "but fee, that what]
hnppers here to day, may happeS el/etubert to-mor I
low ; and therefore we may be confident, they will
unanimously set tbeir faces against the present law-1
less attempt to form a ftparate state. Should they j
quietly give way to violence and ufurpaiion here, J
similar schemes will doubtless be pursued in other j
places, and our country swarm with projeflors, j
who will focn hitter it into as many divisions and J
sub divisions as ambition or avarice may devise.; A j
common sense of danger will therefore unite ail j
~ _ "TSJts of the union against you. If the weftetn in-1
Ci.'re&ion was fiiÃtlnjfd a few years ago, by the j
spirited exertions of the people in fuppnrt of law j
and liberty, how ean others flatter themselves with J
hopes of fi/ceefs, and between whom there is this I
difference ? They had risen in opposition to a law, 1
by many esteemed odious, and dangerous to free-1
dorn. But_yÂ®Â« are 'orraing a projriifc to seize the j
property of other persons ; an enterpriie infinitely
mischievous, and whiah can have no advocates, ex
cept thc-paiti? His of anarchy and plunder.
It is trm.7 we pcrtteis very eahght
ened ideas of government, and bonft much of our
republican virtue, and we are not sparing in our
abuse and contempt of monarchical constitutions.
But what fignify these things, if they are not fuf
(i ient to inducc us to submit to governments of our
czcn making, and rulers of our own choo/ing f Re
publicans who openly oppose themselves to the de
Â«rees of the tupieme authority of the nation, are a

'i Monday, January 9, concluded.
On motion of Mr. Madifcn, the House Went in
to a committee ef the whole, on the report of the
*" secretary ef war, on the petition of M. Poira, fe
ut eretary and aid-de-camp to major-general La Fay
ette. Thf report was in his favor.
It appears that M. Poira followed the example
of general Fayette, in declining to riceive any pay
'I- for his services in the ceurfe of the late war ; but,
n > like his rnafter, having been overtaken by misfor
tune, he calls upon the equity and generosity of
the American nation 10 afford him relief, in the
Â«â¢ fame manner as tbey had, miafked, requited the
lr . ferviees ef general La Fayettee.
aÂ» Meflrs. Coit, Thatcher, and Kitchell, were op.
posed to the allowing of compensation to this gen
"lleman, alledging that his claim flood upon the fame
"y ground with the claims of many other deserving
Â»- men, whose demands had keen barred by the statute
tr of limitation.
or Meflrs. Madifen, W. Lyman, Swanwick, Day
ton and Mat ray, fupperted tbe cause of M. Peira.
They urged it is a finpita cafe. It was aflerted
that M. La Ffvcttff) and hi* family, were the only
persons who hÂ»J fervfd in the wat, with a previous
profelTion that they would receive no pay. They
dei.ied that it was a claim of jufh-e; in that cafe
they allowed the ftatate of limitation would have
barred ii : I> was a claim upi>n the equity arid
generosity of the ion This gentleman, liK- his
mrifter, they said, had been ovettaken ! v i ale -
tune, and to reftife to afford him tint relief Â» oich
juftiee mud have paid him, had he alked it at Â»n
eailier day, would be derogatory to the honor of
the nation. Ii was remarked, by Mr. Swanwiek,
that such couduft was also impnlitir, since it would
difcotirage any foreigner from entering into our ser
vice in future, and wi did qot know how soon such
afliltauce might be valuable.
There is not, said Mr Murray, a farmer in the
United States, who would not approve the afford
ing of relief m rhu cafe | fitr, said he, who among
them of a young man, fend of agriculture, should
serve him faithfully for a yetr, and at the end of
that period, wiAiing to pursue his enquiries intÂ®
distant lands, fheuld leave him, and decline to be
paid fer his services because he did net want the
â Honey, would, if that fame young man should re
turn in the course of a few years in distress and aflc
of his equity and generosity, what, before he could
have claimed of his justice, turn a deaf ear to him,
and fay, " I owe yen nothing j since you did not
receive your due when you might have had it, i
cannot listen to your distress." He believed no one
would be found to do this.
After considerable debate, the queSion was car
ried for making provision, by law, to fettle the
claim ; the committee rose, the bouse confirmed the
resolution ; and a committee was appointed to briar
in a bill.
Adjourned/
Tuesday, January to.
Mr. Dwight Falter, from the committee of
claims, made reports an the petitions of George
Lucas and Joha Wood, which were, again ft them
they were read twicc and concurred in by the
House.
Mr. Thatcher, from the Committee appointed
to enquire if any or what alterations were necessary
in the eftablifiimcnt of Poll Offices and Poll Rentis,
reported a bill, which was twice read, aud ordered
to be committed to a committee ef tbe whole oa
Monday.
O" motiea of Mr. Milleoge, the House refolytfd
itfelf into a committee of the while, oa the report
of the committee of claims oe the petition of John
Gibbons, treasurer of Geoigia. This report wts
against the petitioner.
After a long debate, the committee icfe and had
leave ta fit again.
Mr. Madifuo, from the committee to whom it
' was referred to bring in a bill for making provision
â  for the fatisfaAion of the claim of M. Poita, fecte
l*tj and aid de-camp of general La Fayette, re
ported a bill, which was twice read, and ordered ta
i be committed ta a committee ef the whole to-mer
, row.
Mr. Livingfton said he had a proposition to
t make relative to the communication yellerday re
ceived from the President of the United States,
f and therefore meved that the house and galleries
f might be cleared.

New-Theatre.
THE Managers, (who have been accaftomed uniform
ly to,cÂ»nfult and adopt the public â¢pinion, as well
from motives of gratitude as inetereft) underlland that it
is'generally thought that the price of admifiion into the
PIT, has been raised difprbportionally to the prices of ad
million into the other parts of the Theatre, and therefore
do not htfitate to reduce the price of a Pit ticket to seven
eighths of a dollar.
It is not to be concealed, however, that in making this
facrifice, the Managers risk considerable' pecuniary em
barrassments ; but it is foir.e Cord'olation that while they ac.
cede to the present redu<ftiÂ»n,. they have reason to believe
tkemfelves juftified by the prevailing sentiments, in con
tinuing the advanced price of the box tickets,
â¢which-it would indeed be impracticable to conduit the en
tertainments of the Theatre on a scale adequate to the
public e.xpe<sation, and cotmftent with their ideas of duty
and refpeift to a community Â»n whose liberality they mull
ever depend, and by whose taste they are proved to be re
gulated. x January 30 3t

ient piffages, and excellent dry celiara It ii placcd on a
fine he-lthy eminence, commanding) beautiful views in
every direilion over the towns of Frederickfburgh and
Falmouth, and an cxtenfive ctdtr/ated countryâThe
grounds adjoining the house arc Tieatly laid out in pleas
' ure snd kitchen gardens interspersed with a variety of |
i fearce trees, a choice colleiSiion of fiow.crs and flowering j
! Ihrubs, and enriched by varioos forts of the following
I fruits, viz apples, pears, wilnuts, chefnuts, eheri(es,ppach
i es,plHmbs, neiftarines, apricots, grapes, figs, ralberries,
gooseberries, ftravvherries, and currants; the whale admi
\ rably varied by turfed slopes which have been formed hy
I great labour and expence. Bordering upen these im
provements, are several lots, in a highilate of cultivation,
and well set with red clover and orchard grass, from '
which threeheavy crops of hay are taken every year. Ad

can be furnilhed without being exposed to the inclemency
of the weather. An overseer's house, blacksmith's shop,

ner more than fifty lahourers.
The arable hnds are it advantageously divided as to as- |
ford an opportunity of making a. large quantity of Indian
corn anHually, without bringing the field into similar cul
ture oftner than once in four years; confequcntly the
lands may be inip.rovsd by keeping up the inclofuresduring
the intermediate years, or may be beneficially fallowed for
wheat and other grain at the option of tile proprietor.
On the prcmifes there is also a merchant mill with one
pair orbeft French burr stones, and one pair of Cologne;

accustomed ferry over the Rappahannock to the town of
Frederickfburg. I'lie land con tains inexhaustible quarries
of free stone near to the river, is plentifully supplied with
remarkable fine water and pofleffes a due proportion of
meadow, which by having the command of water may
be ccmuderably increased. The roads are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel and sociable. Infadt, exclufivcof
an improvable and 'well conditioned farm, the value and
emolument inseparably conn.eclcd wit. 11 a mill, ferries,
fifteries and quarries eligibly situated ; the prefits anting

that when examined, 'it will be found to be a complete,
pleasant and healthy , residence, poffefihig beauties and
conveniences fiifficient to attract the attention of any per
son desirous of becoming a purchaf?r.
The motive which induces the fnbfcriber to offer for
sale an estate so Angularly beautiful and advantageous, is
* desire to become an inhabitant of Alexandria,' where he
can with more ease attend to his interests in the neigh

The purchaser may W accommodated with a few slaves
