at their deceafe,tends to dimitiffh the interest ]
and abate the benefit which a just tribute to 1
the memory of departed worth is calculated j
to create. But in the affe&ing inflatice of ;
this young gentleman, the sympathy of pri
vate friendfhip would prompt the attempt,
even if the public utility of doing jullice to j
figt al merit did not fanAion this last melan
t choly tiflice.
Mr. Thomas Lee Shippen, from child
hood, was eminently dillinguifhed fordoci- 1
JlÂ»y of dilpofition, actitenefs of discernment,
and graceful â manners. His early proficien
ts kept thi promise that such faculties gave.
At a time of life when many individuals of
his own age weie, perhaps unblrmeably,
ignorant, or innocently puerile, Mr. Ship
pen was matter of four or five languages
acquainted with the clafiics and modern bis
tory âfamiliar withfeveral subordinate bran
ches of science - and could fu'.laif, in the
best societies, the situation Â»f an intelligent
scholar, and the rank of an unaffected gen
tleman.
Yet these acquirements were eclipfsd by
the best propensities of the human li^artâ
benevolence, lenity, tenderness, a nicefjnfe
of honour, and a delicate regard to duty.
Those acquirements adorned; but these qua- j
lities endeared him. No wonder he became :
the favorite nt.d leader of his companions j
.the pride and boast of his parents. No I
wonder those whose delight and ornament I
he was, all those with whom be was most I
intimate, deplore their irreparable loss, and !
refufe to be comforted.
Mr. Shippen having concluded his eourfe
of pupilage, together with the studies that
afterwards qualified him for of
the law, was permitted to vilit England.â
There, in attendance on the Court of Weft-1
minster Hall, and by an advantageous refi- j
dence at Oxford, he compleated abroad .
whatever had been left urfinifhtd at home. I
Mr. Shippen then Tifitedmany of the chief â 
â¢itics of Europe, indulging a liberal curi
osity, yet lefifliitg the allurements of difli- j
pation. This pursuit gave him opportunity j
to examine the laws, custom*, and forms of j
government of several great nations ; and by
eomparifon of their effeifts on the people,
to confirm that judicious preference which
Mr. Shippen ever afterwards cberifhed for
republican institutions.
At length be joyfully returned to the bo
som of his famil* in Philadelphia. He came
in the morning of manhood, embcllilhed by
pleftfing talentsâadorned by polifticd man
gersâ-improved by sol d attainments. High
health, a commanding form, the graces of
periuaiion, doroettic biifs, the fmilcs #f so-
cicty, a heart animated.by. private virtues,
a mipd replete with- patriotic ardour, now ope
concuired to advance His prefect felicity, tba
and afford him most brilliant profpe&s in the coi
future paths of glory. But in this very con
crisis of growing joy and rich hope, with the
all these blulhing bounties thick upon him, it v
sickness approachedâit smote him, and e- ere
* ery blossom fadedâ a f
" Bit by an envious wwm, go
" Ere he could fptead kit sweet wing* to the
the air t j, e
" Or dedicate hii spirit to the Sun."
During three years, every remedy that (kill
and experience could suggest, or tenderness
apply, was refortcd to for his succour. But
vain were the efforts ef medical fcienceâ
vain the solicitude of vigilant affe&ion.â
The malady, though flow in its progrtfs,
was fatally sure. Mr. Shippcn perceived
his destiny, and met it with fortitude.â
Social chearfulnefs, and the full powers of
hii understanding never forfook him, except
in the paroxyifms of excefiive pain. Nay, t
inflead of drooping, subdued by the decline
of health, his foul seemed to gathjr new | .
strength from bodily infirmity. How fre- â 
quently did he charm and astonish the most j
enlightened of those who came to visit him
in confinement, by the sagacity, the vigor,
the ingenuity, theeloqtience of hisdifcourles. co
Pure in morals, irreproachable in duty, stre
nuous in opinion, untainted by folly, fted
fall in principle, exemplary in conduct, firm a

templated the approach of death with un- J? T
fuffled resignation, interrupted only by, an- 111
tieipations of thf keen sorrow that thrpfe ki
survivors now experience, by whom'he felt
himfelf extravagantly beloved.
The malady that was graduallyconfuming
bis body, by making meditation his amuse- tr
ment, doubtless contributed.,to enrich his
mind, exalt and enlarge it, till at last it
burst from its frail tenement, and he winged
his flight to the world of spirits.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, t 1
_ , f;
FOREIGN INTERCORSE. C
_ t
TUESDAY FEBRUARY 27. f'
Mr. Havens oiiferved, thnt when this y
fubjeft was formerly under cÂ«nfideration,' r
the grounds upon which the prefewt amend- c
ment had been fnpported were, the danger c
arising from an extension of our foreign in- I
tercourfe, from confederations of economy, '
and to prevent undue influence ; on the o- a
ther hand, it was opposed on conflitutional t
ground'; it was said that house had no right
to interfere in the btifinefs, as it was whol- 1
ly an executive concern. y
On all queftiotjs of this kind, Mr. H. â¢
said, the eonftitution of the United States '
was constantly brought into view ; upon '
which different opinions were now entertain- I
ed from what were entertained at the time '
ps its adoption. He always understood that 4
. this government was intended not only to
have all the advantages of a republican go- j
- vernmcnt, but being eleftive, all the advati- f
- tages which arise from a proper diflributiou '
- of power. This principle of a distribution <
of power was derived from the government '
I of Great-Britain, as it wa3 theoretically de'- '
i fcriTjed by Blacklloue, not from what it is in. '
1 practice. His description of tUat govern ">
a ment (which he read) (hewed that every de
-1 partment of it was a cheek upon the other,
if De Lolme, though a panegyrist of the
- British government, agreed in the fame a- 1
:, pinion ; for though hedefcribes the kingly
0 power as raising armies and equipping fleets,
- yet he allows it to be checked by the peo
ple. Here, the doflrine maintained was,
I- that the President of the United States can
i- appoint to office, and that that house had
t, no right to refufe an appropriation, which
i- was wholly subversive of what he understood
:. to be the original principles of the govern
>f ment. Mr. H. said he did not contend for
r, any power in the house of representatives,
J- which did not equally apply to the senate ;
- and if this dodlrine was not allowed, there
f would not be the least check upon the Pre
i- fident by the senate oi the house of reptc
e fentatives, as the concurrent power of the
it senate with the executive only went to the
l- ehoiceof men in the appointments to office.
The President has a right to appoint as raa
iy ny amhaffadors as he pleases, without check
- or control. This power in the President
fe and senate could compel that house to raise
y. any sum of money whatever. They might
a- | make a treaty granting a subsidy to a fo
ne ' reign nation, and that house would be bound
ns jto pay it. They might aifo borrow money,
lo I and might bring the house into such a-(Hu
nt j ation as to oblige it to declare war, to raise
>ft I armies, support a navy, &c. contrary to
ad ! their conviftion of right. But when the
| house makes an approprffttion of money,
"fe the President has the power to put his vote i
at upon it ; and if he can do this, how is it
of; that the two houses cannot exercise their dis
cretion in appropriating for ambaf&dors or
;ft- for treaties ? Whenever an appropriation of
si- money is called for, they ought certainly to
ad . consider for what putpofe it is wanted, and
ie. I whether some mor>* important objeft does i
iff not require previous attention. It was said
ri- the house were as much bound to appro
[ft- ' priate for the falai y of ambassadors as for
ity the salary of the President or judges,
of j When gentlemen reasoned thu-, they ap
by peared to consider the diplomatic corps as a
ile, part of the government ; whereas the guv
ich ernment could go on very well without them,
for And even, with refpeft to the officets of
government', if the money was wanted for
bo- more important fcrvices, such as for the im
me mediate defence of thecountiy, they mud
by go unpaid for a time. He, therefore, con
an- eluded that each branch of government,
igh viz. the Prelidenl, senate and house of re
-los prefentatives, had rack a discretion in die
so-: appropriation of money.
Therc Wfs arother coi;fideration which Â£0
operated ujion his mit;iJ, to convince h:m by
that this was the only conftru&ion whicji wi
could be put upon th e constitution. A re!
considerable degree of difevction was left to pc
the Pn-fident in the execution of laws, and of
it was always in his power to abuse that dif- let
cretion, by beginning a mcafure upon such fei
a scale of er.pence as to oblige congress to ic
go farther than they intended, and except th
the two hoirfes had the power of exerctfing
their sifcrction in checking any such abuse, ot
there was no way of preventing it. There ve
was a singular exemplification of this facl, w
he said, in the Englifti government, in the an
miniftcr's having expended vast lums of mo- w
ney, without the consent of j fit
He mentioned ftveral it:.lances, the two w
last of which were din ing the war with this nt
country, and in the year 17.96. In the for- p<
mer mftance, lie dated that the minister ex- e "
pended 38 millions with the confcnt of Par- ec
liament, and 28 without it ; and in the lat- rs
ter, 50 millions with the consent of Parlia- ei
ment, and 49 witho'jt it. And except the q
legislature had a right to refufe to appropri- v
ate in such cases, there was no way of pre- Ic
j venting abuses.
He believed the house would recolleÂ£l a ;
conduit in feme degree similar to this in our
government. He alluded to the business
of the frigates; since they were begun npon
a plan which obliged the house to consent
to much larger appropriations than they at
firft intended. If it weie neeeflary, other
instances might also be adduced of the fame ,
kind. c
Gentlemen who supported this extraor- ,
dinary power in the Executive, argue in
the fame way with the supporters of Â«he ex
travagant executive power of Charles I. in 1
the cafe of Mr. Hampden, with refpeft to
ship money. It was at that time asserted, '
that" the King, having a right to declare war, I
had a light to demand the service of any man's
perfo*, and consequently to demand his mo- j.
nev. But this doftrine was now every
where ackriowledged to be the molt arbitra- .
r y- . . a
He thought the British government affor
ded another lesson of inftruiftion. After
their revolution in 1688, it was well known
that the government adopted the funding
system. When this took place the house of
Commons ceased to have any control over
the expenditure of public money.' In con- Â£
sequence, the public del)t had increased be
; yond what could be conceived. Mr. H.
read Sir John Sinclair's account of this in-
. crease, and observed that the present amount
r of that debt, exclusive of the last loan of the
. Emperor, is 410 millions. If the house of
t Commotl* had had a proper check upon the
. administration, theri would probably have
1 been no debt at all.
t Government might be considered as fÂ«rm
. ing two diSinftions, viz. payers and recei- ,
vers of money; and it was the perfedtion of
all the state governments in this country, ,
3 that both had a right to judge of the expe- |
n diency of the expenditure of money, and
. particularly the payers. If this check did
e not exiit, no government would long con
t tinue.
3 ' Much had been said about supporting
government. Some gentlemaw called *hem
. selves supporters of Government, and others
u they termed Dejlroycrs of Government, D'if
n organizers, See When gentlemeD fpdke of
t Jupporters of government, .they meant, he
believed, supporters of the Executive branch
D, of Government; so ti at a perfou acquiescing
i. "in every measure of the Executive was a
.. supporter of Government ; whilst tliofa
r< wliD disapproved of any Executive measure
,e were destroyers of Government. This
doftrine alone was fufficient to destroy the
y idea of the government's consisting of feve
-5f ral branches, and to blend all the powers
j. of the Government in the Executive. In
s> this cafe, the goverament of this country
n could not long remaip a free Republic, but
d would become an Eleitive Monarchy, and
h the whole power of the Government would
l( J be in one man's hands. He conld not con
j. ceive that the people of the United States
, r could think this a proper ground upon
S) which this government ought to reft.âlt
; was felf-evident to him that our govern
â¢e ment ought to consist of three branches,
e _ the President, the Senate, and the House of
c _ Representatives, and when that House has
ie determined not to do a thing, the Govern
ie ment has determined not to do it, and so of
e . the other branches,
a _ The fame observation would apply tÂ« a
phrase which they had frequently heard, and
n t which had been introduced in- the course of
f e this debate, by a gentltman from Connefti
ht cut, of flopping the wheels of government.â
o- To put a itop to any executive measure was
to flop the wheels of government; and to
y ; keep them properly running was to offer no
i,. control over whatever the President recom
;fe mended. If this was not the meaning of the
to phrase, he should be glad to know what it
he was. For his part, he believed the perfec
tion of government, cqrififted in what these
>te 1 gentlemen called flapping the wheels, and
it when that H6ufe, or the Senate, determin
|f. Ed they would not gu into that expence,
or ! they speak the voice of -the people,
of It hÂ»l been remarked that the house had
to the physical power to refufe a grant of mo
n<J ney when called upon by the President; but
ies : that members were under a moral obligation
lid 'to grant it. This was faying we can do a
ro - thing but we-ought not to do it. He be
for lieved it was proper for members to do what
es. ever they conceived was for the public good,
ip. When the fubjeft of Patronage was firft
lS a mentioned by the Hoover of this amendment
uV . he was persuaded he only mtant to introduce
â  m . the fubjedt on general ground. The idea,
of as he understood him, was, that all nations
for and locieties were liable to depart from o'ri
im- ginal principles,to corrupt their governments
iuil and in the end to fubvtrt them ; that,
on- in this country we were fubjett to an impro
:nt, percomietlionof-the-difFerttit departments,
re- That it was necefTary to guard against this,
the if an appearance of such a connection should
at any time appear. Ke thought this was
so obvious, that it would be acknowledged t,r
by every one, that we were equally liable *'
with other nations to this corruption. With
refpeÂ£t ta what had been said refpe&ing ap â¢ j,,,
pointments to office being confined to men n e
of particular sentiments, it had been acknow- i Fa
ledged by some gentlemen to have been ob- tif
served in the choice ef men in the Diplomac- J V'
ic corps; but others had acknswledged that .
the regulation Was a general Â«ne. c 0
Was it not evident, Mr. H. asked, that in an
other countries, original principles of go- no
veromrnt were departed from? That there tit
was an inccflant desire after wealth, honour P r
and power ? He never heard of a monarchy
which did not suppose itfelf und'i the nectf-
fity of creating a fort of government party,
who had the difpufal of large sums oi mo- \\
ney, wliich they could diftribnte amongst th
perfonswho were subservient to their purpos
es. He believed thiÂ«difpofition had prevail- f"
ed in all ages of the world, and which had
ravaged the earth. It must be evident to y
every one that peace, independence and e- V]
quality, mud constitute the happiness of e
very country; but it was notorious that the ta
leading men in molt countries had been op- a '
posed to these, for their own ends. Becca
ria, he said, in his efTay on cfimes and pu-
nifhments, had laid it down as a certain prin- q
ciple, that there were in every society such p ,
a class of men. In England, perhaps, this th
was more evident than in any other nation, 'a
A set of mfcn appeared early in that coun- r '
try to render the executive power a govern- *
ment of despotism. The do&rines of pas
sive obedience and the divine right of kings, al
continued to be aflerted fer one whole reign. Â»
After the revolution, the funding system waÂ» fe
set on foot, which bound men to the exec- P
utive by interest; in fafl persons were hired h
' to support a certain system of measures. It
, must appear evident that the great cause of
. keeping that country continually engaged in n
war, had been the host of placemen and pen- tl
fioners contained in the two heufes of Par- t<
liament, who were always inclined to support
measures in which they found the greatest 1
interest. The treasury msft be considered t
as the head of the body politie ; and what
ever party got into power they pursued the fc
fame courseâa course which had now bro't ' t
that nation to the verge of bankruptcy and ; >
ruin. j J,
If this was the constant course in other (
couniriesjwas not this country, he asked, e- j
qually liable to the fame evils ? He believed t
it was. He .did not fay that the evil had r
gone far; but he thought it was proper that c
we (hould be on our guard against any doc- '
trine which may have a tendency to make '
one branch of government dependent on the 1
others,. t
This spirit of grasping at wealth and pow- t
er had been so great, that it had even at- t
tached itfelf to religious opinions.âWhen 1
the christian religion was firft preached, it '
: was of a democratic spirit; afterwards it be- j
came ariftocnftic, and then monarchic ,
1 When, therefore, this lust after power had j
been so general, it could not be said that
j this country was not liable to the fame vices |
and errors. < : -
This consideration was also worthy of at
tention. Men of the best private character
' had been supporters of these corrupt systems.
It seemed, therefore, as if there {hould be
' line of diftinetion between private character
~ and political conduft. Though a man may
pofTcfs the greatest private integrity, he may
still fuppcrt such principles as aiay lead to,
arbitrary power. There could be no doubt
Â» thattliofcperfons maintained the divine right
of kings were many of them men of the
4 greateil integrity; but their doÂ£trines were
c not the less mischievous cn that account.
s In the fame way it might be reasoned with
e refpett to the United State's. Men may be j
' induced to support opinions which have a
tendency to subvert the government,by plac
" ing all power in the hands of the executive
and make the' governmenr a fort of four
* years monarchy. Yet these me,n may be
j men of the greatest integrity, and even pa
triotic, according to their views of patriot
ism; but if others believe their opinions
s have this tendency, it is their duty so to re
n present them to the people of the United
r " States, leaving them to decide the point.
" Mr. H. concluded by observing, he had
'j. heard no reason suggested for a minister at
Berlin; nor could he fee any use for one at
lS the Hague. He was of opinion Vienna !
"j. would be a more fit place for the residence >
of a minister than Berlin. We have.no com
merce with this coantry; and if" we had a- j
* ny wish to intermeddle in the fubjedt of the !
j. balance of power in Europe, we might as
well fend embassies to the Emperor of Ger
many and Ruflia. But he believed we had
~ no business with this balance of power. He
( s thought it was poflible so to manage our af
Â° fairs as to have nothing to do with any of
Â° them. Nor did he think we had any thing
to fear, on the fubjedt of invalion: if there
was any danger it must be from England, by
way of Canada. Besides, if we were to
have any fcrious difference with France, he
knew of no use our ambassadors could be of.
1 It might, perhaps, be neeeflary to have am
bassadors at .London, Pan's, and perhaps
e ' Spain and Portugal; if others were neeeffa
j ry at any time, special agent 3 coÂ»ld be sent.
He hoped, therefore, the amendment would
ât be agreed to, as he thought it was a proper
time to make a retrenchment in the expenc
es of this department of government; and
however small the laving might seem, it was I
~ of consequence to make every saving pofli
j ble, which he wished to be applied to the
diicharge of our public debt.

forming the house that they had agreed upon a
Writ of Summons to be iflued for the appeac
â anceof William Blount, late a Senator Â»f the
United States, before the Senate on the third
Monday in December next.
Mr. Sitgreaves believed it would be proper to
take feme step In this business in order to get an
alteration of the day mentioned in the writ.â
It must be known, he laid, that the day
of the return'of the fummoiis could not be
the day of trial- Previous to the trial, Mr.
Blount must be called upÂ«n to answer to the im
peachment, and a day could not be afligned for
the trial before the iffise was joined. The dis
tance betwixt the two periods reuft be confide
"â¢able, becaafe until a day was,appointed for tri-
fubpeenas ceuld not be issued f< r the atten
dance of witntlTes who lay at a great distance.
The next session must of course be a (hortone,
as the powers of the house expired on the jd
#f Mareh, and would fearcely allow time for
serving the procefa upon the witness, and to
procure their attendance. It would thersfore,
be defireable that Mr. Blount fliould be required
to appear before the Senate during the present
session. He did not know how the demand
from this house ought to be made for thtappoinU
ment of aa earlier day in the summons j but he
thought it would be well to commit themefiage
to a feledl committee, which committee, if "the
house thought proper, might be the manager* of
the impeachment.
Mr. D. Follcr hoped this couple would bÂ« >
taken.
Mr. Nicholas had no objeflion tathe mtflige
being referred to the managers ; bat he wifiied
1 to enlarge the inftruilion to the committee be
yond a mere reference. He doubted whether
it would not be proper that some permanent law
; fliould bepafied for regulating this business. If
the court which was to try the impeachment
had the power of fixing all the rules of trial,
the business might be so much retarded as to
ren- er the prefecution uftlefs. He Wished the
committee therefore, to be inftrufled, to report
the propriety of palling a law for regulating the
manner of proceeding in the trial of impeach
ments.
Mr. Sitgreaves had no ebjeflion to regulating
the proceeding by law. He thought it impor
â¢ tant that thjs (houhl be the cafe. But whether
the delay which would be occsfioned by
! preparing the details of a bill of this kind tvould
not too much protra<S the business, he submitted
to the house. Besides, he believed there was a
bill before the Senate for this parpofe, which of
course, they might expedl to have before them
' ia the course of the session.
Mr. Nicholas thought it wotild be wrong tt>
i procecdin the business without a law.
Mr. Sit;;reaves consented to the inftruiSion
being added, and the reference was made ac
cordingly.
1 The house then again resolved itfelf into a
â  committee of the whole on tile bill providing thÂ«
? means of foreign intercourse w.th > fort'gn na
r tions j when MefTrs Otis and Harper, fpÂ»ke at
, great length against the amendment ot Sir. Ni-
cholas. At the conclusion of Mr Harper'*
fpeech, the question was called for ; button mo
tion to rife and ask leave to fit again, it wa*
' carried-by 50 members rising.
' The house adjourned at four o'clock till

PROPOSALS,
ir thÂ»
Insurance Company tf North Anierica.
For Insurance against Fin, on Dwnllihg-
Houses, Ware-Houses, and other Buildings (and
on Oood* contained in such Building*) diflant from
Philadelphia, in the United States.
1. Common fufurancei, on hazards of the firft
class, will be undertaken at a premium of sfliout
half per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous
rifques a larger pretr i*m will fce required, which
will vaiy according to circumstances, fcidom ex
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; but in some in
stances, where the property insured is not only in
itfrlf extra hazardous, but rendered still more To
by th: vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and
occupations, the premium demanded will be railed
according to eircumftacces.
Houses and Ware-Houses, the walls and parti
tiÂ«ris of wkich are wholly of /tone or briqlc, well
cunllrufled, i'o as to bÂ» guarded as well as may be
against fires from within, and tree l'rom extra ha
zardous buildings and occupations in their neigh
borhood, will be deemed hazardous of the tiril
class, a>id may be insured to their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not oi an extra
hazardous kind, in casks. bales, or pack-agos, de
pofirtd in such buildings, to an amount not ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; but if more' than thisfnm
is required to be insured in one tenement, an addi
tional premium will be required, in proportion to
circumllances.
11. Infursnces will also be made on buildings and
goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to tha risque. But it is not easy to arrange these
under particular heads or daffes, so as to defctibe
each with the ncceflary accuracy. Each east mufl
â  therefore be decided upon according to the cireum
ftances attending it; and these circumftaiiecs wili,
in general, appear from the defcriptioli accor-ip*-
uying the application.
Buddings partly eonftniifted of brick or stone,
are preferable to those wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the stile of building, how they are oc
cupied, how they are fitutted, the neighboring
hiildings, and how occupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And withrefpeft to goods,
their tendsncy, whether from their nature, or
â¢from the niantur in which they arc exposed, either
to commence or to increase an accidental fire, and
their liability in such state to receive damage by
wet, or by fvddcn and hasty removal, or to be fl.o
len in time of confufion and hurry, are all cir
cumstances of weight ; and the premiums muil be
proportioned accordingly.
111. The following cenditiont are to be undÂ«r
ftood by the parties.
i(l. The Infnrance is not binding till the ftipa
lated premium be paid ; but it (hall be deemed ef
fefiual from the time 0/ fueh payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately
signed or not.
Â»d. Insurances may be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without farther ex
pcnfeÂ« than the payment of the premium of the re
newed term, the circumllances continuing the samÂ«
as they were anderltood by the Infurrrs at the time
the former insurance was maAi ; but the payment
of the premium is fuch renewal ; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration ef the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time; nor can the insurance be renew
ed on thd former policy but by computing the
commencement of the renewal from the expiration
of the former insurance. The fubjeft of insur
ance may neverthslefs be open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. If any other insurance be made on the fame
property ; it mufl be made known at the time of
application, otherwifc the policy made on fucji ap
plication will be void.
4th Goods held in trull, or on consignment,
â ay be insured as such in a separate policy} but
they are not to be considered as infuiedotherwife.
sth. This company will not be liable or accoun
table far any loss or damage occasioned by any for
eign invasion, or by any military or usurped force,
or by peafon of any civil commotion ; or occasion
ed by gunpowder, aquafortis or ether thing of the
like kind kept in the building, or amongst the pro
perty insured.
6th Bills of Exchange, Bonds and other Secu
rities, Title r>e ds, Money, Bank and other pro
mifTttry Notes, are not included in any insurance ;
nor are paintings, UfdalÂ«, jewels, gems, antique
curioGties, or mirrors exceeding the value of twen
ty-five dollars each, to be considered as insured un
less particularly mentioned and by special agree
ment.
7th. No insurance will be made for a ftorter
term than one year, nor for a longer term than fe
vea years. Persons choosing to insure for seven
years lhall be allowed one year's premium by way
of difeount: One third of a years preniium shall
be abated in like manner on an insurance for
three years.
Bth. LolTas sustained by fire on property inCured,
(hall be paid in thirty days after due prouf and li
quidation thereof, '.lithout deduction.
A defeription of the property to be infurod will
be ixpe&ed with each application, to be made by
a matter carpenter and fijned by him, as well as
Hy the owner of the building ot applicant for in
surance, and attested before a Notary or principal
Magistrate, who will certify his knowledge of the
parties and their credibility.

" The knowledge of thi Lord Jhall ewer the earth as the \

Living in an age when the devaluations of war
teach us to appreciate and extend the blcflings <j(
peace, all good and enlightened citizens will con
cur with us, that every step which tends to intro
duce the arts of civilisation among the Indians,
rauft be highly favorable to the interest of the Uni

The easy access which may be had at present to '
the different tribes, by means of government ef
tablifhmctits in various parts ef their territoryâ
their tranquil ilate, and the freindly difpofitien of
some of their chiefsâdifpofe the Society to believe
that their arfdrcls is net premature. They presume
that nothing more is necessary to excite the atten
tion and fciure the fuppart of their fellow .citi
zens than to present their plan to the confederation
cf the public.
THE Subscribes, penetrated with a convic
tion that their duty and happiness are involved in
promotipg the knowledge and diffufing the spirit
of th*' t/hriflian religion, do aflociate for the pur

recorded are well fulftautiate , an d thereafoning
