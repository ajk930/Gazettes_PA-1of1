HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES- <
Friday, March a. Â«
The House being in a Committee of the Whole
on the Bill providing the means of Inter- ]
course with Foreign NatioiA, and Mr. Ni
cholas's amendment being under conlidera
tionâ I
Mr. OTIS
HAVING been abfei:t during a very ela
borate and protracted dilcuflion of the
present amendment, and having observed that
all arguments pertinent to the lubjeCt had been
long lince exhausted, he had been gratified by
the belief that the occalion would not require
him to e\prefs an opinion. But Gentlemen
not appearing to be content, even with the ve
ry ample examination already bellowed on this
â¢tieftion, without reviewing and copiously en
larging upon it, he would claim the indul
gence or the Committee in liltening lo a few ,
observations on his part, though he was ap
twehenlive that his powers of utterance in the
present State of his health would not enable
him to do jultice either to the subjeCt or to
himfelf.
The objects-os this amendment were olten
fible and rael. The olteniibie motive lstore
duce the Salaries of two of our Foreign Minis
ters, at Lifbo" and Berlin; but various real
motives, and of a contrary and inconsistent na
ture were alligned by Gentlemen who sup
ported it. Some avowed that it was a prepa
ratory measure to the discontinuance of the
â whole lyltem of Foreign Inteic-ourle ; other
confeffed the probability that this intercourle
to a certain extent, would always be indepen
dable, but that it might be reduced, and the
defti nation of the Minilters fixed by the House;
otlvers again, contended for the nghtof fpeci
fying the amount of the.r lalanes; âbut all
mull agree that one real object was to try the
itrength of pasties; a"nd another, to sanction
the practice of an annual invective againlt the
Executive, and to confirm their to in
terfere with his measures.
Strange as were some of the irgufnents used
\>y Gentlemen, he (hould think there had Jjeen
mure cotour fop them, upon an original pro
pofttion to eflablifh or tu extend our Foreign
Intercourle,. though in that cafe he Ihould
contend that they were not warranted by tlie
Constitution : but this queltion was not upon
the creation ofanew eftabli(hment, it wasupon
changing one which already exilts. The date
and duration ot its exitience are immaterial
the debate and deliberation which accompa
nied its adoption were alio-unimportant, ft
â was to him a new doctrine, that laws mull be
repealed and fyflenis unsettled, on the ground
that principles had not undergone a futficient
difenrtion. Should th:s doctrine of surprize
fce fuftered to prevail, there would be no (ta
bility in our laws, and no conlillency in our
conduct. When an ACt has patted the Legis
lature withourdebate-, the presumption is that
its expedience was too evident to be disputed,
and he" who would effect a repeal of fpeh an
aCt, like a plaintiff in error, should be pre
cludsi from objections that might have been
*Â»rged against the original process, and be con
fined to a demonliratLon of experimental mil
chiefs. In (he present instance, however, he
â was not reftrictea to this, groundâThe appro
priation for the Minister at Berlin was the iub
jeCl of debate at the lalt fefiion ; and though
no op'poiition-jwas made to ajrproprianon
for the advanced gxaÂ«ie of the MuutU'li lu Us-"""
bonand Madrid, yet the principle on vÂ« hich it
was granted provoked a controversy which en- ''
j' t aged all the abilities and ingenuity of both j
parties. This.last appropriation was made on :
the ill of June, 1796, pursuant to the Presi
dent's message of May 28, in that year; but ,
in the fame month of May the House had de- :
cided in favour of the appropriation for the
Britilh Treaty, after a debate that continued
many weeks, and which involved the fame
principle. âIt was indeed a curious argument
of the Gentleman from Maryland (Mr. S.'j
Smith) that the vote of the majority upon the
eall for papers, (hewed the opinion of the
House with respeCt to the right of refilling an
appropriation; the contrary inference was
certainly more just, from the decision upon
the main question, on which some of that fame ;
majority voted in favour of granting the mo- I
ney, and did actually grant it.âHe (hould,
therefore, perfilt in his assertion, that the
friends to the amendment ought to have de
monstrated the inconveniences resulting from
our foreign intercourse with Lifbonaud Berlin
inltcad of descanting upon the dangers attend. ;
ant on Executive patronage; for, it these in- :
tonveaiences were ferioully alarming, and if ,
they had a right to interpose, the MinisterS â 
ought to be recalled, be the patronage ever
so inconsiderable; but if advantages had re
sulted from their miflion, they ought 10 be
continued without regard to the patronage ;
and if it were uncertain whether they would
promote the public welfare or not, time should
be'allowed to them to make the experiment
under the direftion of the proper department.
In this firft and mod prqper view of the ques
tion, he would enquire what evils had arisen
from the present eltablifliment of our foreign
intercourle ? The answer was plain and con
clusive. None from ottrintercouri'e with Lis
bon and Berlin, the only countries implicated
in the amendment; we were in perfect har
mony with them. Great Britain, Spain and
France, are the three countries from which
our embarrassments have arisen, and these, in
the two firft instances, cannot be imputed to
our stationary Ministers, or our Treaties; and
in the last, Gentlemen themselves will be un
willing to admit that the public interest has
fuffered injury. The British depredations had
never, as he understood, been imputed to our
Treaty with France; it was more natural to
ascribe them to a spirit of violence and injus
tice, which is too common to powerful nati
ons engaged in war, Â»nd to apprehensions of
our making a common cause with France ;
apprehensions that were unfortunately coun
tenanced by the conduCt of French Ministers
and citizens ; by the enthusiasm of clubs, by
the equipment of privateers, by civic feafls,
and by loud and unequivocal demonstrations
Of joy upon every fortunate event that befel
their arrrts, which rebounded from one ex
treme of the continent to theother.
If-from Great Britain we went to Spain, it
would not be pretended that our nte misun
derstanding with that nation was to be imputed
to our Ministers redding there; but entirely
to her Ministers and officers in this country.
With refpeCl to the agency of our late Min
ister to the French Republic, in our present
i ontroverfy, he was aware that a great diit'er- I

ance of opinion prevailed. There were thojp
who believed that lie had betrayed the inter
ests of his country, and that he was either the
or the tool of that nation; that he had
bad dvfigns or weak nerves, that he was daz
zled by the (plendour of theirViftories, or ca
joled by the ardour of the fraternal embrace;
that he fup'prelfed communications which it
was his duty to have made, and contraCledob
ligatioÃs which he was not authorised to ful
fil.âThere were those who thought that the
disclosure of his inltruClions was not only in
jurious to his country, but a measure for
which a Minilter in Europe would be hooted
by all parties, and in France would lole his
head ; that it was a measure which even the
mod unjust accusation (hould not have promp
ted, and forwhichinjured innocence could claim
noexcule.âBut there are others who contend
that he has aCted a part becoming the Minis
ter of a free country, that a Republic (hould
have no secrets, except such as might be dis
closed to o.ir magnanimous ally, with the con
fidence that a lover whispers his tale in the ear
of his mistress. It was of no moment, which
of theic opinions he espoused. Gentlemen
who supported the amendment did not believe
in rhe former. But >( his private feutiments
were required, he was ready to profefshis sin
cere persuasion that our difficulties with
trance were not to be imputed4o any one
man, but to a desperate and misguided party,
existing in the bofomaf ourown country, who
were in leajjue with other bad citizens resident
in France, and with the French nation; and
he had no doubt that regular information and
inftruClions were conveyed from this country
to influence the measures ot the Directory, and
impede our attempts to negociatc with fuc
cels.
The British treaty was notthecaufe of the
measures adopted by the French in relation
to our commerce, but an apology for those
measures. 1 hey had captured our vellels
and laid embargoes upon them, prior to the
ratification of that instrument, nor was this
treaty, deemed a justification of their conduct
until many months after they were acquaint
ed with its contents.
But we are challenged to (hew any advan
tage*, gained by our treaties and intercouHc
with foreign nations. He thought it easy to
fpecify many, and to (bew the probability of
others, whiclf might (till be expected.â
And firft, France (till continued to manifeft
a difpolition so hostile and injurious, that he
could not relyat present upon any instance in
our connection with that nation to aid his ge
neral position.
Secondly, Great BritainâHe did not feel
it incumbent on him to become the encomiast
of the British treaty, nor was he to be deter
red from exprrffing hisopinion upon it, thro'
fear of giving offence to its warm and nume
rous adverlaries. Had the provilians of that
treaty been more beneficial to the country,
had we been able to make a treaty to suit our
own wishes and circumstances, he should have
been more happy, but this was to fay nothing
that would jiot apply to every treaty. But
had no advantages resulted from that com
pact ? Had we not obtained the-weftern polls >
Has not lead a partial comp/cnfation been
made for the fpoliattons upon ourcommerce f
Is it not probable that we have been saved
from i war with that nation, whose powerful:
navy wÂ»uld have proved more formidable to
ourcommerce, than the whole force of any
other nation i Or,tf jjentlemen now believe
tha' Â«;e <H twn at open war,"
"WTtf they maintain that the Bntifti depredati
ons would not have (wept off the greater part
of our navigation ? On the contrary, we have
1 gained three years time, in the course of
: which our commerce has prospered under all
i disadvantages, and in the last of which our re-
I venue has increased by nearly two millions of
dollarsâThese advantages were not (light or
contemptible ; but a more important acqtti
fition had been secured by means oi that trea
ty. It has been inftrumemal in correcting
our unfriendly preiudices agamft one nation,
, and out blind admiration and affection for a
nother. It has restored the equilibrium of so
ber judgment. It has given feppe for the A
mencan character to unfold itfelf, and taught
us the value of our own rights, in preference
to those of any other nation.â
Thirdly, believed that the ad
' vantages secured to us by the Spanilh treaty
had never been doubted or denied. It had
been'faid, that for this we are indebted to an
envoy extraordinary, and not to a stationary
minilter ; but who can fay, that the talents
and addrefsof htsrcfpeClable friend from S.
Carolina (who was not then in his place) could
have accomplished this object with the fame
! facility, had not the good will of the Spanifli
i cabinet been conciliated by familiar diffusi
ons ot the controverted points with our mini
lter resident > Or who will pretend that our
interest does notrequire us to prefcrve the be
neficial relations of that treaty, at the expence
of fupportng a minister conltantly at that
court t This is now contemplated by the a
mendment, as new modelled, but the argu
ments originally applied against this eltablifh
ment in common with others.
Fourthly, PortugalâLisbon is the obser
vatory from which we raufl watch the variable
alpeCts of the Barbary powers, and protect
ourincrealing commerce to the Mediterrane
an; by our connection with that country, we
had procured the advantage of pacifying those
powers. She. also afforded an asylum to our
vessels in time of war with those Hates, and
not unfrequently the protection ot a convoy.
Fifthly, Prullia âWhat employment can
we have for a minister at Berlin ? He would
mention some of the ufeful provisions to be
found in our treaty with Prufliaâit stipulates
tograut convoy incertaincafesj itcontainanolifl
i of contraband articles ; it agrees that the ef
fects of our merchants dying in that country
hall rot be confifcated. And this treaty, in
common with the treaty with Sweden, recog
nizes the great and important principle that
" Free bottoms make freegoods," a princi
ple-whicK is allowed to be of the highest im
portance to the commerceof this country, and
the direliCtion of which in another cafe, had
drawn forth the heavieftcenfures. But other
reasons for renewing these treaties had been
afligned by the President, in his meSTage at rhe
last l'efljon, which he coufidered deserving the
highest attention. But the gentleman from
Pennfylvariia (Mr. Gallatin) hadafferted that
this meliage was at variance with the valedic
tory address ot the late Prefident,and to prove
his aflertion, he had grossly perverted the
meaning of the meliage.âThe President had
!' never intimated that we should interfere in
the adjustment of the political balance of Eu
rope ; but that car. ran was proper to pre-

per to prevent our being thrown into the scale
of either of the European powers. A fenti
meat perfectly in unison witli the whole tenor
of the aJdrrii, and with the system of his Pre
decessor, in whose time the grade of the mini
tier at Lilbon was advanced, and whose ad
vice was, that in exteadufj* our commercial
connexions, we Ihould beware of political
Co in parts.
It is for the public to decide upon the mo
tives of that gentleman, in attempting to
prove the exiltence oi a ditferent policy under
the late and present admimltration.
The fame gentleman had allowed that it
might be necessary to maintain mini Iters at all
the courts, with which we have commercial
treaties, but that consuls are adequate to all
purposes in other countries. We have trea
ties of commerce, or of friendfhip, with all
the countries to which we have sent ministers,
except only with Russia, (the treaty with
which has lately expired, and ought tÂ« be re
newed), and Portugal, where the gentleman
himlelf"would not feriouily contend that a
confitl would be competent to the business.
It is well known, that consuls are intended
merely to accommodate private disputes, and
are not under the protection of the law of na
tions. Whenever they receive credentials for
tranfatting public bulinefs, they are ministers
and not consuls.
But, fay gentlemen, ministers resident, or
ministers with reduced salaries, will be ade
quate to the management of our affairs at
Lisbon and Berlin. He wiQied to know from
what source the gentle mar) from Maryland
derived this information ? Did he correlpond
with the Prince of Peace, or tlie Cardinals
,cr Grandees of those Countries ? Or did he
acquire his knowledge troru the captains ot
his own vellels or any of the passengers i He
wilhed, at lead for more jirecife.information
on thisfubjett, and thought the change ought
not to be made upon flight suggestions, or on
account of personal prejudices against either
of the persons now in office ; he added that
minified resident going out of falhion.
Holland alone commiflionsof that grade.
The lowest diplomatic rank now usual, is that
of ministers plenipotentiary ; and if we mean
to preserve any foreign intercourse, it must be
done by such agents as are accredited at the
courts near which they reside, who can have
readyaccefs to the fountains of power in those
countries, and be placed on a footing in rank
and consequence with their affociatcs.
The projeit of totally abolishing our fo
reign intercourse, he considered as perfeitly
chimerical, and when a resolution mould be
offered Â»o that effect, it Ihould be accompani
ed by a propolal to encompass our seaboard
with a magic circle, and to build a Chinese
wall on our frontier. We are a member of
the great family of "nations, and our comfort
and convenience, require no less than the ge
nius of our people, require an extensive com
mercial intercourse with other countries;
and this gives rife to rights, regulations and
controversies, which mull be explained and
adjusted by such ministers, as by the cult cans
of those countries have a claim to attention
and refpeft.âlt had already been Ihewnthat
on* ministers sent for the purposes of com
merce, and ot requiring information, would
not increase our political connexions with Eu
rope ; but said the gentleman from Pennsyl
vania, " it is natural for man to aÂ£t in whate
ver sphere he is placed, and if they cannot do
good, they will do harm . Mr- O h*tiÂ«vad
Â«v<rr tnrs priWljSle~mignr be more applicable
to individuals in a Icgillature, where responsi
bility was divided, than to a public and re
sponsible miniller.
Mr. O. contended that this view of the
queftioii was fufficicnt to fatisfy the calm and
dispassionate enquiries of those who limited
their right to interfere with this power of the
Executive to cases of actual abuseâ-It would
be fatisfaCtory to fay to those, point out the
abuse and we will unite with you in devifjnga
remedy j and where they failed to da this, it
would be more than latisfaCtory to aiTume the
burden of proof and demonltrate ths.t the au
thority has been exercised for the public ad
vantage. But there are other men whole en
joyment of the present is always clouded by a
gloomy anticipation of the future, and who
are never contented with themoft ample mea
sure of prelent liberty and security ; but
brood over the histories of kings and the op
prelfions of arbitrary power, until their ima
ginations are heated by day and their visions
dillurbed by night, by the spectre of tyranny
stalking over their country â" Whence and
what art thou execrable shape 1" is'*' ques
tion proposed by their Itartled fancy to every
proportion and measure of the Executive.
This jealousy is uncomfortable to themselves,
and inconvenient to those with whom they are
called to att, but it is sincere j it therefore de
serves to be reasoned with, to be pitied and
forgiven.âThere are also other men, much
less ianocent, who really feel no fugh jealousy,
but who expeCt to promote their views by *'i
"apparently noble and patriotic affectation of
it. These are the exclulive guardians of the
public welfare, the centinels who forewarn us
of future danger, the political quacks who
acknowledge the body politic to be in per
fect health, but at the fame time foretell its
untimely diAblution, unless they are permit
ted to furfeit it with their noltrUms, and to
bleed and blister it into long life. These men
make a loud out cry against all influence
which they d(f not lhare, and all patronage
under which they do not balk. Now between
these two descriptions, these over-heated be
lievers and hypocritical profeflbrs, it is ex- %
tremely difficult to diltinguilh.âThey utter
their lamentations in the lame language, and
they avail themselves of the fame occasions.
In times of alarm and danger, when the pub
lic mind is agitated, when the storm approach
es and men grow anxious for the lafety of
their families and their country ; these two
orders of men are ever found to talk loudest
and increase the exilting ferment. âHe had
no doubt that some- men of this latterdefcrip
tion had insinuated themselves into every le
giflatr.rebut the present. If he supposed that
any of them were in that house, he Ihould
deem all argument 101 l upon them. He Ihould
merely fay to them, " Gentlemen go on with
your fpeeclies ; they are the fame in fubttance
that were made two thousand years ago. Shew
me a well alTorted library, or even a set of
the parliamentary debates, and I will find you
an huni'.red models of such speechesâThey
are the fame which t>anifhed from Greece her
best and most virtuous citizens, which filled
Rome with profcriptisns and blood-shed ;
which excited revolutions in England and
turned Paris into a charnel-house; which have
done some mifchief in our town meetings and
l!ate houlc yard:, lÂ»ut which, upon thÂ« sober
sense and cool reflection ot the American peo
ple, produce no imprefiion that is deep or vi
lible." He thould fay to them, " yiou de
claim against corruption, and protefs views ot
alleviating the burdens ot the people âSo did
the tribunes of the Roman people and all the
race of reformer:, fromtheii times 10 the prc
fent. This was the language of Oliver Cro
mwell, who was once a leader of a feeble mino
rity ( it was the language ot Sidney, whose
book the gentleman from Pennsylvania has
read, and who, after writing the fine things in
that book, has left an equivocal character,
and has "been charged by the pen ot hittory
with receiving bribes from the French.âit is
the fame language that is used in the Britiih
House of Commons by Sheridan and I'.ox,
possibly with gnod intentions, and it wis the
favorite theme of Marat Sc Robefpicrre in the
French convention, who certainly hitd the ve
ry word intentions. âPerhaps your meaning
is perfectly honel ; but no taith is due to
profeffions ; we must adhere to the Â«ld stand
ard of truth, " by their -works jiaU ye know
t htm."
But, upon the presumption, thai there arc
some in that house who are fcriÂ«ufly alarmed
upon the fubjett of Executive patronage, -nd
who prophecy future danger from that source;
he begged leave to a)k for a precise definition
of the meaning of thole Do thefc
gentlemen mean by patronage, the right veil
ed in the President by the conftitutisn of no
minating to certain offices I Surely not 5 for
tbis would be an infndious reproach upon the
constitution itfelf. Do they then mean, the
natural influence acquired by a fair exercise
â¢f that powet; ! They will rvot allow this to be
their meaning:' For the influence to a certain
extent being the inevitable consequence of
the right, an objection to one is an objection
to the otWer, and both again are objections to
the conllitution.âThe only obnoxious mean*
ing which in his view could be applied to Ex
ecutive patronage, was an undue influence a
rising from an improper and unconllitutional
exercise of that power, and this could happen
but in two modes, either by the appointment
of improper characters, or by making the ap
pointments too numerous âWith respect to
the characters of the persons appointed, it
was not suggested by any gentleman that the
President with the advice of the Senate, had
not a constitutional discretion ; it was not
contended that the authority of thejioufe ex
tended to th3t point; no person had yet open
ly avowed tlfisdefigno breakingdown all the
barriers of the conllitution, of opening all the
flood gates of innovation; if any gentleman
would hazard such a pretention, he must be
prepared to order the President and Senate to
take their feats in this houle. Had then the
appointments been too numerous ? He had
attempted to shew that our connection with
other countries required them all ; but if he
had failed to convince gentlemen of this truth,
it would not follow that the Executive was
solely culpable on this- score ; for upon their
principles, the house could have refufed an
appropriation in the firft instance, and they
were therefore felf-convicted as acceflaries
before the faCtâFurther, the amendment
would not diminilh the number, or the pa*
tronage. The present ministers might indeed
resign, and tht vacant offices might gain over,
or confirm two other proselytes to administra
tion.
But we are directed to take precautions a
gattift-the future abtjfe of powers that are at
present used with wisdom and moderation.-
So then we mutt do evil that good may come
of it.âThis may be agreeable to the mo
dern theories of political jujheeâWe must alio
bind our fuccetTors, and legislate for the next
generation.âThis was not consonant to the
modern theories of the rights of man. Gen
tlemen malt be careful, left their favorite ai|Â«
thors btrtray them inro contradictory theses.
Did not the framers of the constitution forefee
that affl its powers were liable to abuse f Did
they attempt to change the nature of the hu
man paflions f No, 'hey were content to fur
r.ifti the departments with checks fuflicient to
prevent inltant danger, and to remedy aClual
abuse ; but they never intended that they
thould speculate beforehand upon the mifchitf
which they might retpettiveiy do each other.
To anticipate such cases, was to amend the
constitution, and if gentlemen could be in- !
dulged, there would be.no end to the paflion
for amendment, every seam in the constitution
would be unripped, every ornament lopped
oft', new cloth would be added to the old gar
ment, and therein would be made worse.
Again, said Mr. O. it is edifying and amu
sing to remark the great uneatinefs entertained
by gentlemen at the danger of the Executive
power, and the'eompofure wich which they
regard the powers in their own hands âIt was
another proof of the control of prejudiceover
the imagination. The gentleman from Penn
sylvania, according to the humour of the mo
ment, might imagine a period, in which the
Executive thould arrogate all the powers of
that house, and make treatiesand riife armies
witV,ut their consent. On the contrary, with
a lets violent effort of the imagination, he
could ftippofe, that at tome future day, there
might exilt within the walls of that house, a
furious and inveterate party,whole ruling paf
lion thould be an invincible hatred of a wife
andvirtuousaduiiniftration; a partyoppofed to
every meafiire calculated to raise the droop
ing honour of their country ; a party infatu
ated by the politics of another nation and in
different to the degradation of their own ; a
party forever aCtive to embarrass and divide
the people, and always inventing means to
diltract the public councils, and to fever the
Union. But as there was room for imagination,
there might be some for hope ; he therefore
invited that gentleman to hope for, and to
join in promoting a better state of affairs ; and
to place before his view the piCtnre of an ad
miniftrationfullof energy; alegitlature harmo
niously moving within its appropriate sphere ;
to their government with confidence and af
fection in trying exigencies; a government
organizing, by prompt and vigorous opera
tions, the resources of the country for the pro
teCtionof its liberties and rights; beloved and
prolperous at hoiue, and feared a
broad. This was the pfofpect on whiqh he
delighted to dwellâTh s was the hope which ]
he fomet.mes cherifheii at his heart. i
Let us, (aid he, delcend from the regions of
imagination and reason from analogy
He believed the polition to-be found and. ten
able, that in a government conllituted .Jfice
ours, the danger of an unjult atTuuipti oil Of
power was on the tide of the popular branch,
and did not arise from the Executiveâand for
thi'. opinion, he would fubinit a few obvious
reasons. In the firft place, a House of Repre
tentative has ttroiiger inducements to extend
I its powers. The lovcof power, he would flip*
pofeeqctal in all men; and this fondnefs arife-'t
not merely from the pleasure of po Helling it,
butfromthe fatisfadion ofdifplaying what Â»c
poflefs. The ordinary business of legiflatior,
is a remote nperaiion, the execution of the
laws it a dk*Â£t operation. In the latter, tie
hand that moves is more visible, more feared,
more refpetted ; and as men affeel power, not
only f<>r the fake of strength, but ostentation,
a House of Representatives is not likely to be
infenlible to this charm. On the other hand.
the Executive pollelling this advantage undtr
the Couftitution, has no motive to enlarge the
bounds of h ; s authority. v
Again, a House of' Representatives wculd
generally potrefs a greater (hare of the confi
dence ot the people. Its members Â«hofea
from the body of the people, are presumed to
be actuated by the lame feelings and interells
with theircoaftituents; and in doubtful cases,
they have the daily advantage of pleading
their own causes before the tribunal of the
public ; while the Executive is heard only in
formal messages and addrelfes. This advan
tage inspires thÂ«m, in the third place, with
greater confidence, in themselves, and their
refpQnfibility being divided, bold pretention*
are advanced by individuals, the merits of
which, if fuccÂ«f*FuU they claim forthemfelves,
while the discredit of a bad experiment is di
vided among their companions. One other
reason had been often mentioned, to which he
would (lightly allude, though it was very im
portant and conclusive. The greater'facilitv
ofextending the legiftative power,by reason of
its general and comprehensive character. The
power of the popular branch was, in ilvs re
lpfcft, like a river fome times overflows
and sometimes undermines its banks; while
that of the legislature might be compared to a
lake whose margin was defined, and which ne
ver rose above a certain level.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania had ven
tured an atrertion repugnant to this doctrine,
and had assigned two reasons that fliould ren
der the popular branch less able to usurp an
excess of power than the Executive depart
ment. It had not the Esprit du Corfu and
the privilege of imposing taxes was odious in
its nature. He utterly denied the faft, that
no Efpritdu Corpsexifted in such bodies as that
house. On.the contrary, it was always clojir
and unden : able. Did no* that spirit exist in
the Britifti House of Commons ? and was there
not another house in which a party was seen
obedient to the very <wink of its corporals ?
There was not more weight in the other ob
jection ; for those members of a House of
Representatives who were most ambitious of
popularity and influence, had the address to
be in a minority upon all questions of taxa
tion, and to escape the odium attached to the
impositions of public burdens.
.He would not follow gentlemen who had
preceded him in their illustration of this doc
trine, by examples taken from the republics
of Greece and Rome. It was true, as the
gentleman from Pennsylvania had asserted,
that no great resemblance could be found be
tween those states where the principle of re
presentation was unknown, and a reprefenta.
tive government constituted like ours. But
the comparison might become just, when a
house of reprefentatHes (Uould engross the
whole power of the country. Representation
was the greatest improvement in the science
of government, when modified and divided
into different departments ;--but he could fee
no difference between a ftngle house of repre
i fentatives, and the Comitia of Rome, or the
i popular aflemblies of Athens, except as the
! former would unite greater abilities and ad
| dress, faction might seize its prey with greater
I certainty.
Bui if the resemblance did not hold between
| ancient and modern republics, there was dill
| less between our government and the feudal
governments of Europe. He would howe
ver quote one or two eS tmplej from history,
which he thought applicable to this position.
In the time ot Charles the First of England,
the parliament conceived the design of "redu
cing the undue influence of the crown. They
began with aboliftung the more odious and
oppreflive prerogatives ; but did they content
themselves with a wife and neceflary reform ?
No, the work of reformation was takeirfrom
the hands of those who began it, and was pro
secuted by one set of fanatics succeeding an
other, until the constitution was subverted.the
monarch was bro -ght to the fcaffold, and the
government fell firft into the bands of the par
liament, who were deprived of it by Crom
well ; and after the people had groaned tor
years under thedefpotifm of this patriotic and I
republican rcformer.'hey called in their young
king, who became more arbitrary than his fa
ther; and fodifgutled were all ranks of men
with the abuses of usurpation, that tho' tome
conceflions favourable to liberty were obtain
ed at the accellion of the Prince of Orange,
yet the crown has acquired an influence which
is now truly overbearing ; but which could
not, perhaps, be reduced with fafety to the
country.
But why do we refufe to go for inftruftion
to France ? Is it from motives of policy that
we decline to moralize upon the scenes which
have happened in our own time ? Or does
not the lnltance apply f It is well known,
that a very large majority of the firft National
Convention, conlifted of men whose intentions
were very distant from a definition of the re.
gal power. They intended to limit tlrat pow
er within wholesome bounds, and to reform
the great and enormous abuses of th<* old go
vernment. They attempted to frame a con
stitution, after deciding in favour of a legis
lature with one branch, which deftroyedÂ°the
hope and poilibility of a constitution, and
when the wretched instrument that was called
by that name was produced, and the only
good feature which it contained was, the ne
gative giv.-n to the king ; the legislative boilv
intoxicated with power, and impelled by it?
furious leaders, compelled the monarch to
renounce it. This i.tcrifice, was soon sealed
with his blood ? Popular leaders then l'quah
bled for the supreme power, the people look
ed on with horror. Robcfpierre prevailed
the fame Robespierre who had so often raived
agÂ»Â£>Â£ corruption and waftc of public money,
1, draw a veil over the mournful, well known
sCenes that followed. It is fufficient, that the
people, flying for refuge from anarchy back
to defpotilm, have permitted the Executive
Directory to take all the powers of the nation
into their hands, to hold the prize, to com
mand the army, and to-difpofe of the lives of
the citizens.
It is, therefore, for our common interest,
to extend the powers of the house, with the
greatest caution, other-.vifc precedent will fol

Vlr. O. obfened, tliat he Ihould hive at
tempted to (hew, tlut these lcgiflative en
er ichments had fometimrs happened in oar
own country ; but the "gentleman from New.
Jerley (Mr. Imla v) had read the authority on
which he meant to rely. It was Mr. Jener
fon'f notes on Virginia. He would, however,
take occafton to read another paflage, to ano
ther point.. When the gentleman from Ma
ryland (Mr. Smith) was pleased to compli
ment the Virginia members with the putt di
rect, he did not know but that some invidious
reflexions had been made upon that date.â
Thedefign, however, was understood bv him.
when he perceived that a gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. T. Claiborne) by a rideran
i nexed to his written (peech, returned the
compliment to the people ot Maryland. For
h s part, he thought it highly improper to
criminate the designs of the people of any one
(late, hc presumed the people of Virginia
were like other people, ami with some of
their representatives it was his pride and his
pleasure to think and to aft. There were
others from whom he differed in politics, and
whose measures and opinions of government,
he believed to be pernicious and unfounMâ
But for them tie found an apology in that
book ; Mr. O. then read the parage in Jeffer
â¢ Con's notes page 194 âwhere ;t is hinted that
j lie govern me nt of Virginia is an tltXivt def
foii/'tt j and a palTage page 195, to thisefFecl,
" that the direction of the Executive during
the whole time of their session, has become
habitual and familiar." It was, therefore,
natural for gentlemen edusated in thole habits
of diftatingto their Executive npon all occa
sions, to form erroneous ideas ot government,
â¢ and of the Federal Confutation. Mr. Jeffrr
fon has indeed remarked in the fame book,
that this conduft of the legislature ofVirginia,
" proceeded from the heft intention 1, and that they
lucre m 'jlcd hy art and dejign in otters" âHe did
not m?an to dispute upon the fubjeft of their
intentions, but their measures he could never
approve. .
\ftcr so much had been said upon the fub
vcct ot Executive Patronage, Mr. O. would
add but a fe<v obfervatiohs. The patronage
of the Executive was fairly presumed to be
the patfonage of the people. When a man,
afterrendering the mod important services to
his country for a series of years, is defied at
an important crisis of national affairs to the
liigh office of President of these dates ; his po
litical opinions, in general, and his sentiments
upon the exiding (late of affairs, mud have
been known to the people by whom he was
deftcd. It mufl all'< have been forefeen,
that he would purfije ftich a fydem of adminif
-11 alien, and hy the aid of fitch means and a-
tits as would be bed calculated to give effi
cacy to his own sentiments and fydem. His
fyflem, therefore, may be considered as fanc
tioued by the previous a (Tent of the majority
ot the people. His conditional patronage
is the patronage of that majority, and to m
creafe that majority by all fair means, istoin
treafe the chance of public tranquillity. It
is an important duty that fbopld bejudicioufly
exercised, and no' an offence to be disavowed.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania, as a
pipofof the patronage already enjoyed by the
Kxeeiitivtj h_d exhibitedanaggregateamount
of the salaries of the public officers, and con
tractors 111 the United States. Biira large
proportion of these officers were not appointed
by the Executive, nor d : d they feel any de
pendence upon him. In many instances.they
would be found among the mod zealous op
pofers of his measures, and cnlilled under the
banners of his adversaries. Numbers of them
appointed by the heads of department?, were
ur.knowa to the President, and feeling morally,
sure of retaining their oljiccs, except in cafe;
ofgrofs mifbehaviotir, they were often led, by
the violence of oppolition, to prepare for a
change ofmen and measures, and to be more
solicitous for the favour of members in that
Itou/e, w ho might attempt to raise or diminilh
their falaties, than of the Executive himfelf.
After so much liad been said refpefting the
"cnltitutional right of the House to refufe an
.appropriation, Mr. Otis obfevved that hc
Ihould add but a few remarks.âTo prevent
conftifion on this subject, it might be well to
tfate the poiuts in which both fides of the
House were agreed, and those in which they
'hflVnted, âIt was not denied that the Presi
dent had the right of nominating public Mi-,
nillers; nor had it been contended that the
iloufe pollelfed the right of fixing their fala
i is; the doctrine ot his friends was merely
that the appointment of a Minister imposed
a moral obligation to give a reasonable fahjjy,
and that beinjj once' determined, it was unjiid
to reduce it without tiie bed reasons. It was
doubted by the Gentleman from Pennsylva
nia, whether the office of Minider.was crea
ted by the Constitution, and whether it was
not competent to this House to fix the dedi
nation of a Minister, and it was afl'erted by
him that in all cases the House had an autho
rity to refufe appropriation. On these
tall ppints they were at iffiie. To explain the
reason of his doubt refpefting the right of the
president to designate the Courts to which the
Ministers (hould be lent, thafGentleman had ,
rclici that the fame clause in the Conditution
which gives the power of appointing Minif
ies to the Executive, aifo gives that of ap
pointing Judgesof the Supreme Court; which ,
he never pretended to cxercife until the num. ;
btr of Judges had "been afcertaincd by law.â |
In this argument he hardly appeared to be
ferions 1 but he would answer, that the fame
-Conditution provides that a Supreme Court
f ; ill be edabliflied by law," and it lias no ex
lttanee until created by law.âA Court is a
,urifdiftion committed toone ornvore persons;
the jurisdiction is conllituted by a Idw, which 1
defcrifces the number ot persons to whom it 1
nallbecommitted; the Executive then appoints '
those who ire to exercise this legal jurifdiftion. 1
In cafe of foreign Miniders, if their deftina
fco:i ntud be edablidied by the I.egifiature, the
cbjeftj of their miffton mud also be anderdood
-ind ratilird by the fame authority, or it mud
be exercised without discretion ; and the
whole power of negociation would thus be ,
attraftcd as incident ta the other.
It was further urged bv the lame Gentle- ,
â¢tun, that in all cases the House might refufe ;
to appropriate ; otherwise the Executive
r.t'ght ablorb all the powersof thelegillature,
.ught toon I reaties ot Alliance, maintain an ,
Army ind Navy, all the public
tie.ifure.
I.et us conrtder, on the other hand, the
consequence of that Gentleman's rWtrinc.â
.J very appointment made by- the Executive
comes a nullity, unless ratrjed by that '
House ; in the face of the Conllitution whidi
'â¢xcludes them, and confines this dutv to tJie.
with the advice of the Senate.
It was owing to the apparent
' .Jingtrom athrorotical view of confutations
tke ours; that they wer~ pronoiftKed to be
â practicable by some Â»>f the bed writers of
â > itiquity. And these abdract qtiefitons and
cafes were not calculated to reconcile i
.muds of our citizens to our excellent torn
kl government. It is a plain conclutive I

â  I sentiment will yield to reason and explanat:-
r j on, and that extreme cases are not likely to
1 j ?>ne word in relation to the motives of Gen
. I tlemen, and he would finidi h:s obferyations,
, which, he was admonished, by his voice and
. Â»teelings hid been too much extended. Why,
said Gentlemen, do you charge us with de
. I signs to subvert the Conditution t Have we
. ' not our (hare of wealth and ot power ? He
i I was not one of those who had imputed fucli
â  designs to Gentlemen ; nor would he pretend
, to (ay whether the part of the Union repre
-1 fented by thole Gentlemen was ritto, or gene
â  rally involved in debt. But he would fay,
; that wealth was not alw ays a fecurity.forpub
r lic or private virtue. Was not the Duke ot
> Orleans rich â¢ Was hot his income equal to the
reivenuc of a kingdom ? But hc was not fatis
fidd with his elevated rank or princely for
f tune âHeconfpired-with others, men high in
s dation, who poflelTed both riches and their
r (hare ot power, and promoted a revolution
I which, like a whirlwind, swept thctnofl into
, fwift dedruftion.âlt is not easy to dilcern,
- 'and therefore not always neceflary to impeach,
the motives of men. When, therefore, a
Gentleman exclaims, we want no revolution,
: we wilh for no change, we wish to keep things
quiet, he was not authorised to dilpute the
ztfurance, and fay it was uot true.
But when, in the fame breath, lieheardin- ,
(â filiations eompar : ng the I'relideut ot the
United States to Charles I. and the mild ex
ercise of a conditutional power to the odious
claim oi Jhif-money, in that reign; and w4ien '
he heard further, the opposition to the pre
fentbill compared to an oppolition to that o
dious measure, he would not fay that he dif- ,
credited the profeffions of Gentlemen âGod (
only knew fheir hearts, but their language
was full of danger.
The Gentleman from Pennsylvania had '
concluded with an invitation to his friends to i
unite with him in twoobjefts; in preventing :
the incrrafc of foreign Influence, and In dirai- (
nidiing the expenditure of ttie public money.
He would meet that Gentleman; and, if lie
and his friends would discover a real disposi
tion to join in measures to prevent the increase '
of foreign influence ; he (hould almolt be in- '
rlined so secure that advantage, by confcnt- 1
ittg, for himfelf, that they should dispose of >]
the money upon their own plans. I

Mr. Co it, from the Committee of Elec- .

Mr. Livingston observed, that the Set

with the Senate. i 1
Tiie Speaker said it was firft necedary for t
the House to determine they ivould not recede I

The (enfe of the iloufe was accordingly ta- :
ken, and having determined to inlid on their *
difagreenient, a committee of conference was
appointed. '
Mr. D. Foster, from the Committee of t
Claims, made an unfavourable report on the a

The Speaker laid before the Hpufea com

Portland Marine Society, who pray for cer- v
tain buoys to be placed in Portland harbour, f
The report is favourable, recommending the e
placing of fix buoys in the said harbour, the r
expence of which is ellimated at 400 dollars.
The report was referred to the Committee of a
Commerce and Manufactures, with indujCii- ' Â£

A message was received from the Senate, 1 e
informing the House tlut they had pafl'ed the e

providing the means of intercourse with for- '

Mr. Sew At, l wished the House ftp go into c

resolutions which had been referred to it. J'
This motion was objected to, 011 the ground
of further information being expefted from c
the President with refpeft to our dispute with f
France, and occasioned a very warm debate v
(which (hall be given to-morrow). It was
at length agreed to go into a Committee of the

I-
S : HOUtR OF I.ORDS, f>IE MIHC. January ir.
The question was put, that this bill be
â¢ ! committed.
e It was carried in the affirmative,
e DUskntiemt,
h Because, we conceive that in the pre.ent
f circumftapces no grant of money by parlia
ment, can alone be fuffieienTto extiicate the
country from its alarming and critical fitii
- ation.
it When the exigencies of the State are
e such, a* to demand large supplies from the
people, our duty is not confined ta the bare
~ confidcratiun of the ceceiEty of the cafe or
ââ  the mode of levying .the money. We are
n not from the prefiure of cireumtlarices and
o the approach of danger, haitily to concur
'Â» in laying additional burthens on our fellow
'â  fubjedts, without in luring to the public a
" wife application of the money so r.aifed, and
3 without due precautions for diredling the ef
e forts of the people to their only legitimate
objeft, the benefit of the community. A
â¢ neglecl of this moil important of all parlia
e mentary duties produce, and in our o
~ pinions, it has already produced confequeuc
n es the moil fatal to the dignity of the na
tion, the (lability of the government, and
- the interests of the pe#pls. In the uncon
- dirional compliance with the demandsofthe
executivt government again proposed as the
f remedy, we perceive the real and fatal source
j of the evil. Year after year his majesty's
0 ministers have giounded their application to
g parliament upon the urgency of the oceafi
- on, and the extrantrdiriaty exigeacies of the
State. To fatisfy their demands, to enable
them to encounter the dangers, and remove
c the difficulties in which we are involved, e
- very article of luxury or convenience have
- been taxed,the resources of the country have
' been exhausted, and fumÂ§ unparalleled in
history, have been eatrufted to their dispos
al; yet, year after year the occasion has
been more urgent, the exigencies moreprefT
. ing, the difficulties more alarming, and the
dangers more ir-imcdiate. The fecarity of
- the nation has been shaken in the fame pro
> portion as the profperityef the country has
1 been impaired, external danger has kept
r pace with internal distress, and the exertisns
which have impoverished the people, and
r shaken our credit, have purchased nothing
: but the loss of national honor, the defection
â¢ of allies, and the failure of every great ob
je& of the war.
. If the whole force of Great Britain and
Ireland, aided by grants, lavilhed beyond
f the example of the moil improvident timet,
; aflifted by the most powerful monarchs of
â  Europe, has proved inefficient in the hands
of ministers to secure the blessings of peace,
or even to' avert the present awful circam
. fiances of the country, it seems inconsistent
. with reason, to expeil that the painful ef
. forts of an empire, whole means ate exhauft
| ed by taxation, whose spirits are damped by
failure, and whose affedlions are in part
j- alienated by oppression, can, without a sin
gle ally, under the direftioa of the fame men
. relilt with effeil, a powerful and exafperat
, ed enemy, elated with success, strengthen
â  ed by conqued, and supported by the unit
| ed powers of Holland and of Spain. In
this situation of affairs, to perfever? in the
[ | fyllem which has produced it, to confide in
r the ministers who, with the aid of so many
. ' millions, have been unable to avert it, evinc
> cs, in our opinion, a total disregard of the
; common maxims of prudence, a wanton re
je&ion of the lefion3 of experience, and a
[ determined negledl of tfie most important of
1 ! our parliamentary duties. Under the per
-1 suasion, therefore, that the dangers with
: which we are now threatened, are the result
J of force, dire&ed to objeds at once imprac
[ ticable and foreign to the interests of this
- country j and that they arethenecefTary confe
. quences of a misapplication of the public
- money, and the natural fruits of the iuca
. pacity and profufion of those to whom it
j has been improvidently entrusted, we deem
ed it iftir duty not to fanaion any grant to
I the executive government until a pledge was
[ given to the House, by the removalÂ°of his
â¢ his majesty's ministers, of a complete alter
ation in his councils. We held it neither
k just to impose, nor reasonable to require any
; additional facrifices from our fellow fubjeds
until (ome profpeft was held out to the peo
[ pie of a reform of that house which had
granted and a censure of thoft ministers who
have lavished sums so enormous, without a
ny benefit resulting to the community. We
thought that while his majesty's affairs were
conduced by those who originally engaged
in this calamitous contest, and who can nei
ther carry on war or negociation with honor
advantage, or success, no grant of money
by parliament, no facrifices on the part of
the people, could afford a reasonable hope
that the bltflings of peace would be speedi
ly rettored, or permanently secured. We
imagined, that until some earnest was given
of a radical alteration of the system of ter
ror and coercion in Ireland, of the repeal of
the two bills, the one intitled "An a& for
the fafety and preservation of his majesty's
person and government against treasonable
and seditious pra&ices and attempts," and
the other intitled "An a& for the more ef
feftually preventing leditipus meetings and
afTemblies," of (Economy in public expen
diture, and diminution of the enormous pat
ronage and influence of the crown, we are
not warranted inexpefting that cheerful co
operation of the people, which being at
once the indication and result of a recipro
cal confidence between the government and
the governed, can only be restored.by the
relloration of the ancient and happy prac
tice of the cor.ftitution undisfigured by coer
cive lawsâcf a parliament speaking the
lenfe of the peopleâand a miniflry depen
dent 011 the voi-.e of th? MtltsmttnV.
Beccufe it appeal to uÂ» tkat ar.y attempt
to'raile the supplies within the year, in the
present exhaufhd state of the country, must
be attended with the grcate'.t difficulty and
danger. . .
Because were we to allow that the [prin
ciple of railing the supplies by contribution
in/lead of loan, was jnft, wife and expedi
ent, ret under the'prefent ministers it would
appear to us attended with the mod danger,
as the real expenses of the year have jrener
a'.ly exceeded by nearly one half their cal
culation ; and thus- any regulation for the
equal distribution of the burthen which we
adopted upon the firft calculation, might be
rendered ineffe&ual by subsequent and more
extensive demands. (
Because if the bill is i-.n ended aÂ» a tax
upon expenditure it? retrofpeftive operation
is arbitrary and cruel in the extreme, and al
together repugnant to the uiages of our
ancestors, the fahll ofcivilized
and the common dictates of humanity and
juflice. If it is intended as a tax upon in
come, in our opinion the criterion proposed
is objectionable and iusdeqnjie â¢; and above
all, as income is of rarious descriptions,
sometimes arising from permanent and dispo
sable capital, sometimes from precarious or
temporary pofleflions, and sometimes from
labor, talents or industry we deem any at
ceropt to proportion the burthen to the in-
Come, in itfclf urijuft, unequal and impoli
tic. If it is intended as a tax upon pro
perty, neither in the original criterion, viz.
the a fie fled taxes of '95, r.or in the propo
sed relief, do we recognize any just princi
ple of taxation, or perceive any fair or ade
quate method suggested for the imperial dif
tributionof the burthen.
Because the relief proposed in the bill,to
those who may, by the increase of their al
fefled taxes, be liable to pay more than the
tenth of their income, requires a difalofure
of their peconiary circumstances, which is
contrary to the customs and prejudices of
Engliflimen, and repugnant to the princi
ples of the eonflitution ; and which to per
sons engaged in commerce or tradf, must be
attended with yet greater inconveniencies
than the payment of more than the 10th
of their income. Furthermore; this re
gulation ap<pears to us an indireft >. breach
of the faith so often and so sacredly pledg
ed to the stock-holder, for should the whole
of the income of any individual claiming
this relief conilft in a dividend upon stock, a
tenth of that income is immediately facrifi
crd, and the dividend, in violation of the
faith of the parliament and the nation, di
minished one tenth by the intervention of
government.
Because the operation of this bill ii not
confined to a definite period of time, but by
the mod wanton violation of justice, re
mains in force till a certain sum is produc
ed ; thus exacting from the honefl the de
ficiencies whish may have been occasioned
by accidental circumstances, by the designs
or the distress of individuals, by the favor

a squadron of line of battle (hips, had fal

richly laden,under the convoy of three Spa
Â«i(h line of battle (hips, bound from the

whole of the fleet. The greatest credit wai>
given to the above information at Lifooti,
I inafmnch that the arrival of the Spauifh men

Admiral Parker had hoi#edhis flagon board
h,s Majelly's ship Princess Royal, and had
failed with fix line of battle (hips, to cruize
off Cadiz, and to fupercede Sir fohr. Orde.
Both iquadrons would form a very strong
fleet, and Admiral Parker wa3 to have the
command, to cruize off and on Cadiz bay,
and watch the motions of the Spaniards ly
i.ig thcr*, but who durst not venture oat,
tho' ft much superior in numbers to the Bri
tish fleet. A fleet of merchant vessels had
failed from Lifton the 26th ult. undrr the
convoy Â«f his roajefty's (hip Irrefiftahle, of
74 guns, G. Martin, and, a (loop of war,

sixteen vessels. The emigrant hrmy was
down at Calh Kies Fort, all in readiness and
expefted to be embarked for England, in
transports waiting to receive them, having
been all marked and numbered. It was re
ported a; Lisbon that Lord St. Vincent .
had declared to the Court of Portugal, that
et their refufal of supplies of provi
vifioys and water to the Britifli fleet, he 1
would reduce the city of Lifcon to ruins.
His lord/hip was in perfed health when the

Notice was given at the Bank of England
| on Saturday that Books will be opened and
receipts given for voluntary fubfcriptioni in
aid of the Requisition which is now passed
into a law. The law direds that the bank
ihall give receipts for funis that may be paid
in, together with duplicates, if required. If
only receipts without duplicates, shall be
required, then such payments/hall be deemed
and taken to be the voluntary contribution,
but if they require a second receipt or dup
licate, such second receipt or duplicate (hall
be deemed and taken to be in advance of the
new assessment ; and which receipt (hall
upon delivery to the colleftor, be an acquit
tance of such affeftnent as for as the fame
will go ; all funis above the auual affefl
ment to be deemed and taken as the volun
tary contribution of tS person crr persons.
That the Aims to be paid into the bank in
this way over and above the amount of the
assessment of each individual may be great,
we hope that fplepdid examples will be set
from the highest places. Their Majtftifjs
and'all the court have beefi called upon in
a strong and pointed way. The people ex
peft fabrifices, and this day we trufl will
prove that there is a just feeling in the higher
circles of the burthens they have brought
upon the country.
Admiral Thompfoa and Sir Roger Cur

Now that Parliament is adjourned, thÂ«
loan is immediately to be fettled, Mr. Pitt
has fortunately made a competition, so that
the terms will be more advantageous than
he might otherwise expeft. According to

It is a most dreadful blow to our trade;
but it is ridiculous to charge it upon the e

LONDON, January 18.
ExtraS of a letter from citizen Joseph Buon
aparte, ambajfador from ihe French repub
lic to the court of Rome.
" tlorence, iithNivofeâDec. 31.
" On the 6th, three persons came to me,
and informed me that a revolution was pre
paring, and that the insurgents hoped far
the support of the French government. I
replied, that the epoch of geaeral peace
did not appear to me to be that in which
my government ought to take any part in e
vents which might retard it ; and, at the
French minister, I enjoined them not to
come again to me with fueh propositions.
" " Next evening, Chevalier Azarra told
me confidentially, that he had just been with
the secretary of state, and that it appeared
probable some imprudent persons were about
to attempt a rising, which would be as un
fuccefsful, on account of the fmallnefs of
their numbers and their fbllilh conduA, SJ/
that which was undertaken some months
before.
" I learned at the Marchioness Maflimi's,
that four of the leaders of the affair were
the fpiesof the government, which had ta
ken mtafures to defeat the plan of the in
surgents.
" I was informed, the day after,'that a
patrol had been attacked by about sixty
men, and that two of the Pope's dragoons
were killed. Several of the insurgents wore
the French cockade, and left, as it were by
mistake, a bagful, which were fcattereda
bout the place of meeting.
Â«' I'went immediately to the secretary
of state, and told him, that, far from op
posing the arresting of the persons who had
aflumed the French cockade, I came to re
quest him to arrefl all who did not belong
to the French legation. These amounted
only to the number of eight, and I pointed
them out to him.
" The Cardinal secretary of state went
to dinner, and begged me to come to him
at fix in the evening, along with the Span
ilh minister.
" On my return home, I found general
Duphoz and adjutant-general Sherlock wait
ing for me. We conversed upon the child
ish attempt that had been made at a revolu
tion during the night before. We had fat
to table, when the porter came and
informed me, that abont ZD men had pre
' fented themselves at the gate of the palace,
erving Live the Republic I Live the Roman
Peop e !âOne of them infilled upon speak
ing to me. He had the appearanee of a
wild fanatic, and said, TVe are free, and tve
come to demand the support ef France ! I re
plied to this extravagance by desiring him
and his companions to retire immediately
jfrom the jurifdi&ion of France, or other
wise that I should take strong measures a
gainst them. The military men who were
with me endeavored to convince them of
the folly ef their enterprise. Were the
government of the town, said general Sher
lock, to point a [ingle cannon against you,
what would beconie of your pretended lib
erty ?âUpon this the man withniew.
" A French artid came r.nd informed
we, that the number of the multitude with
out increased, that handfuls cf piastres were
thrown among them, and that the entry to
the iÂ»onrt was ohftrudted. 1 drefled myfelf
'n my diplomatic robÂ», and went into the
csur't, accompanied by the French officers
who were then in the palace. I heard a
Jong discharge of musketry. A party of
cavalry had penetrrted intw the midst of the
French jurildidtion. A great multitude
filled the court, and the different stairs.
But soon thsre were â¢nly to fee iVen persons
. , t \ J, .
VyiSg. intur.idatfi fugitive*, and er.thuS- th
afes. 0 |
" A company of f.itflsera closely follow- ta
ed the cavalry. I ordered them to with
draw from the jurifdi&iou of France. They tl
fell back some steps, and the people adÂ»anc- ir
ed in ) voportion as they retired. But it tt
appeared that the Papal troops had only h
made this retrograde, motion in order to be f<
out of piftel Riot, and to be able to make $
a general discharge of their muskets without J
any danger to themselves. 1 delired the aid n
de-C3mp Beauhamais, and another French b
officer, to endeavor to quiet the multitude ; b
and I advanced myftlf, along with generals t
Duphoz aÂ«d Sherlock, to invite the troops
to cease their and to return without
the French jurifdich'on. a
" Brave general Diiphoz, accustomed to t
conquer, threw himlclf among the bayonets f
of the Pope's soldiers; he prevented one t
from chaiging, iiud avoided the push of a- j
nother. HÂ« was Grr.ply a mediator between 1
the two parties. Misled by hi 3 courage, he ]
proceeded as far as the gate Septiminiana.â 1
A soldier fired a mu&et at him, and the Con- i
tents lodged in his breast. He fell, but vofs
again, and supported himfelf on his sabre
A fecor.d shot extended him pro Urate on |
the pavement, and about fifty was dire&ed
agai*ft his inanimate body. This brave '
warrior was to have been married the nest
day to my filler in-law.
"Though protested by all the French
artists and military I could gather round|me,
I regained the palace with much difficulty,
which I found filled with,the dead, the dy
ing, and the fugitives. .
"It was now fix o'clock. Two hours
had pafled finee the mafiacreof general Du
phoz, and no member of the government
had yet appeared. The Spanish andTufcan
minillers only, liaftencd to the French pa.
lace, to (hare in the dangers to which I was
exposed.
" No official correfpondeace took place
between the Cardinal Secretary of State and
me until eleven in the evening. I thought
it my duty to leave Rome ; and at fix in the
morning of the 9th Nivofe, fourteen hours
after the murder of general Duphoz, I
quittedthis criminalcity,to go to Florence."
Joseph Buonaparte concludes his letter by
stating, that he will soon repair to Paris, to
give farther accounts of the crimes of the
court of Rome, and to consult with the
Dire&ory on the punilhment which ought
to be inflidted upon a government as cruel
as perfidious.

We flopped the Press on Saturday, to in

? which the King of Pruflia announced to

â¢ government, be no security against an event
of such extensive injury to the Northern

d MADRID, Dec. 18.
1- We are looking with much impatience for
e the conclusion of 1 general peace. Spain
o fuffers from the war more than any other
if power, because the war exposes her to ma
e ny dangers in her diflant poffeflions, and he
's cause it intercepts hertreafures from the A
a merican continent. On this account the
if exchequer is in the utmost penury 5 so that
e the government is obliged to have recourse
e to the mod barihenfome ekpedients. It
j. hasjuft negociated a third loan, hearing an
is interest of five per cent for the year, with
the aruremenf of a lottery, giving a profit ' *
of three per cent on the total of the capi
tal borrowed.
This resource will soon be exhaufled if *
the war be prolonged,because the reimburse
ment depends on the arrival of <Â»nr precious
metals from America, in whicl) the King V
haj always a (hare. It would be (lill worfc
for ns, if it ftjould happen, as we have been
