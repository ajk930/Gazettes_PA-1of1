AT a juncture when .the qucftion of
a CetfiK.erciai Treaty ivitb France may soon
become an objc& of difcufliien, a wÂ«rkÂ«f this kind
becomes extremely ufeluf to thofc Â«itizens of the
United States, who may be desirous to enable them
fei ves to view this fubjedt, under its various af
pedb ; and they will have the fatisfadlion to be
furnifeed with the ncceffary data, to judge of the
ttfefnlnefsof this tranfa&iou.
This work is principally diftinguilhed by the
richness of the observations, the pcrfpicuity of tho
i*cas, and the modesty of the theory .which it
contains. At Pars, a man of wit ebferved, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufeful produce. It is addref â¢
fed to the unfortunate La Fayette, *a letters,
which fugitive form, the author Xvho could only
devote a few weeks to this occupation, was obliged
to adept. Although are in many
refpc&s different at the present day, from what
thÂ«y were in the year 1790, when these letters
were written, yet it maybe justly faid,thatfo ma
ny absolute and permanent data (till remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
fill t oi the author's remarks, it will serve to con- j
vince him that in all tranfa&iotis, between free j
nations, every thing may be cxpedled from the ef
forts of truth andjuflicc.
LETTER I.

LETTER HI.
EfTay in the form us a tableau, to appraise the im
poitaiions into the United Slates Jinn France and Eng
land united. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better lurnifhed from France or
Englandâlt is principally on this lubjeft (which
would have artonilhed a mere thcoriit) that the auihor
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kina of taklc2ux> uuluckily as riiffxcult to obtain as
they are much to be dcfired, arc the only sure guides
the flatefman can take for th policy of treaties, de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We cannot too much admire the apparent ex
aftnefs of colonel Swan's dalculations. ; and although
the propbefles of Lord i>hctHeld have already been
contradicted by experience, and by feverai able pens,
yet it is curious to lee the author of the prelent work,
difpuie with him the only ground on which he has
1191 been hitherto attacked, by proving that Frauce,
under the required condition, will t>e better able
than Gieat Britain to supply us with feverai articles,
which the author allots excluQvely and forev
er to ihe latter; ihc author's partiality *ffcÃ on (if he
has any) does not appear to Have at any urae created
9 partiality of judgment. Thd result of this calculation
is that m >789, that is to lay, at a period when arts
and manufactures did s>ot present in Franec the vail
means and probability ot cxtenfion which they now
pofTcls. that even in 1789, it was presumable, that
France would not only have the means to supply one
half mi any given auantiry of the productions of France
and t united, but also to enter into competition
with GÂ»eat Biitain tor the remainder, :n proportion
te the wisdom of her government, and the mduftry
of her inhabitants.

PHILADELPHIA,
FRIDAY EVENING, FEBRUAKr 9.
EiktraS of a letter from an inhabitant of Pittf
inrgh.
" In the notes of the debates in con
gress, on tbÂ« fubjctS of making a farther
provision for the daughters of the late Count
de Grade, it is obfetved by a member that
there are claims of equal or superior right
amongst derelift widows and orphans of A
naerican citizens who have yielded important
military services in the course of our revo
lutionary contest. The widow and family
of the late general Butler are particularly
mentioned. lam not about to compare the
services of general Butler withthofeof the
Count de Grafle, being diftinft in their na
ture; the one with the command of a fleet,
yielding aa important service on a single
great occaCon when perhaps he could have
avoided it, with less nfque to his reputation
and refpotiGbility than by supporting his
station in our favour: a foreigner also, and
from an enthusiasm in our cause, to riujue a
great deal was not .to be demanded. Nor
(hall I compare the filiation of the daugh
ters of the late Count de GrafTe with that
of the widow of general Butler; being al
so materially different, these thrown upon
oar coafls naay fay totally destitute, and
calling for the feellings of humanity to
themselves as well as gratitude to their fa
ther. Nevertheless at the fame time that I
approve of the provision made for the daugh- j
ters the late Count de Grafle, I think it 1
ai (hame to the American republic not to
have taken feme notice of the family of,
general Butler. I always well knew, and
perhaps was the firft tint acquainted Mrs.
Butler with the circumstance of the fall of
the General, "that (he was not within the le
gislative provision of Congress for the wi
dows of officers that loft their lives in the
service, for that refpeÂ£ied only the revolu
tionary war; and I saw clearly the embar
raflroent of Congress in extending that pro
vision to the establishment since the war, as
it was no part of the terms on which com
missions were given qr retained in the course
of that service. And it was more than I
expedled when I heard that a bill making
that provision had palled nearly bo':h houses
of Congress, and was loft only by one vote.
My idea always was, that, of making a
special provision, gratia, not for the wi
dow of. the general, for she does not abso
lutely (land in need of it; but the sons of
the general. His was small but not
embarfafled ; and his widow though no; in
affluence, is above indigence, from her dis
tributive (hare of theeftate; but the delica
cy of her fitnation is that (he is not able to
give her fons'an education worthy of their
fÂ» hers rank. She has struggled hard, and
by great economy, and the sale of proper
ty has been able hitherto to continue tneir
education, but must (hortly give it up. The
eldest is fourteen, and the younger about e
leven years of age. A small matter would,
enable her to continue them at an aaademy,
and save some real property,' with which
they might begin the world when they are
of age : fay three thousand dollars : What
would this be to the fund of the United
States; and how much to their glory? At
the fame time that it would be honourable to
the public, it would be a delicate compli
ment to the memory of general Butler, to
have this notice taken of his sons; adopting
them in a degree by the (late, and taking
that care of them, which the fortune of war
put itoutof their fathers power to do_
The general was certainly a deserving of
ficer; and distinguished hijnfelf on many and
great occasions, particularly at Saratoga, at
Stoney point and at Monmouth, where the
bayonets of his regiment checked the Brit
ish horfc and covered the retreat of the troops
under genaral Lee. At the flege of York
town also, in running the second parallel;
The battle of the second of Nove raber 1792
where he fell, was the loth in which he had
been present; and his condudt on that d3y,
though unfuccefsful, did not disgrace his
former reputation.
I (hould think under all the circum
stances of this cafe, it is hard that his chil
dren (hould not be provided for in such a
manner as to introduce them into life "with
some refpeftability. The son of General
Mercer who fell, at the battle of Trenton
hasbeen taken careof. On the fame principle
I would have something done for the sons
of General Butler.
Shall monarchy have this advantage over
republics ; that there is a greater capacity,
or at least greater habit in the government
to compensate individual services, by the
special interposition and muniiceuce of the
Prinee ? The history of Greece and Rome
affords at least some instances where the in
digent worthy, who had fought glory and
despised wealth, was buried, at the public
charge ; and his daughters endowed in mar
riage and his sons educated after his death.
It is impossible by a general law to reach
particular cases. The danger is that appli
cations will be frequent.. Better this, than
what would in faft be injustice ; or if not
injustice, at least a great impeachment of
national honour and generosity, and, which
mult sap that very virtue in the bosom of
the public rtian which is the principle of a
republic, who will fcrve in the field at !
least with enthusiasm where life is most un- j
certain, when he reflefts that extra courage 1
and extra service if I may so express it,
will not be able after his death to procure
the babes which he leaves behind more at- '
tention from the parent state, than thofeof
him whose mind has never risen beyond the j
idea of mercenary pursuits, and the aug
mentation of hiteftate ?
I fugged these things to you, either that
you may romnr.unicate them to some mem
ber of Congress, or give them to a Gazette
if you think they <nay ia any degree contri
bute to incline the attention of the public :o .
this fubjeft."

Rcmrrlj nn the p:cre Jjgrirri " /In adntr.-r nf
â  the true American churaSir," in Monday's
G at.it te of tap Uuitcd States.
VVhat diliintfion does our conQitutioti
make between foreign born citizens and the
â  satire born ? Only that such of the former
j clsfs as hare come to this country since its
_ ! adoption qannot.be ehofen to the office of
r President of the United States ; all other
t ; offices are as much within their reach, as
. ! within that of native citizens. The eonlti
j tution is then arraigned, when attacks arc
_ thus made upon that class of citizens. In
reason *nd in faft, what is the diltinftinc
tioiftetween the foreign born, and native
, citizen ? Truly it is in faÂ»or of the former ;
, he is a citizen of the United States from
, choice the latter from chance.
, Again ;is not Mr. Lyon a reprtfenta

1 But Mr. Lyon underwent a term of fer

Lyon, that from a low beginning he has
: raised himfelf to competency by iaduflry
and acquiredtuch a (landing among those
I he lives with, as to be appointed to one of
j the firft Rations in their gift. None but a
1 proud, prejudiced and felfifh being, an aii

cause he did not draw his firft breath on the

him, because the consequence he has acquir

to him by his ancestors, but earned by his
own industry and merit.
Answer to tie above.
MR. FEVNO,
In the Aurora of this morning, Mr.
Bache very much disapproved of my vindi
cation of tho national charadter of the U
nited States.
I mentioned that " Mr. Lvon was born
' n Ireland and fold in the United States,
for his passage hither," not as a fault in
him ; but in order to account, from his ed
ucation, for the indecency with which he is
chargedâlt is probable, from the manner
in which he came to this country, that he
was among Jthe lower class in his native
country.
Neither ought what I said, to be consid
ered as a refledlien upon foreigners general
ly, who come here. Upon all, who turn "
demagogues the moment they are landed ;
upon all, who profefs a supernatural affec
tion for this country and hatred to their
own, I am willing it Ihould be so consider
ed. Btrt I know of many foreigners, who
are not of this description ; men of modes
ty ; men of worth ; men, who, for the
value of tKe numerous advantages this coun
try fields, are willing to submit to the ve
ry few reftraintc, its government imposes.
But wily docs Mr. Baehe wish that Mr.
Lyon's indecency flujuld be thought char?
afteriftidtof this.country ? Is it because he
vyifhes to fee his country funk in ignominy ?
If Mr. Bache wishes that Mr. Lybn's con
duct ftiould be thought charafteriftick of
the editor of the Aurora, I be
lieve all the people will fay amen : but
he must excuse the great mass of Ameri
cans from btlieving, that such infamy is at
tached to their chara&er.
An admirer of tht true American charaSer.

TRANSLATION.
The hi/lory of arts has made a valuable etcqutfi
tion by the raising of an excellent iron bridge over
the Strigoiv ttfck at Laalan in Upper Silejia,
which has been Jtn'tfhed last fummtr. All the
iron requifitefor tbertmcutinnof this undertaking,
â¢was fnrnifhed by the forge ofMai apart, belonging
to Count de Surghauft, vii.
Cast iron 93191 l-2lb.
Forged do. '459
â weight of the bridge 94650 1-2lb
This work was completed in ten weeks by sixty
persons who were employedforging and cajling
iron, transporting the materials to the spat and
in raiftng the fabric. The whole expences
amount to s,2lopollers and 20 cents.
Tht bridge is 52 ( Rhemjh) feet long and
I Sfe et wide. The arc in its greatejl width con
tains 40 feet and is 9 feet high. 7he ground
workof the bridgeconfijlsof ten iron half -circles,
thepainted end of which, on one fidefit into holes
made for that purpose, in tht pedejlals, and on
the other, they enter into a kind of a key-bar of
cqfi iron, which forms the center of the bridge
and weighs 2,4.00 lb. The pame of the forge
Mtlapan and from which allthe iron was taken
and the date of the ereSion are inferibtd on the
elegant front pieces of this centre-bar. The
pedeflals are of frreflone,tovercdwith iron plates,
into which holes are made for the reception of the
pointed ends of the half circles. The latter are
are, covered with iron plates 18 feet long, &
having each on the inside five notches, which Jit
to the edged backs of the half citde, & keep them
at the proper dijlanie from each other. Certain
! cross bands of cut iron, which are fajlened by
I means of screws & form c kind of a net on the
j concave fide, prevents the bridge from inclining
' towards either fide. The of the bridge, have
! the shape of a corni/h fupperting elegant ballujlers
1 and lanthorn pofls, with handsome iron bajkets,
!cn which reft globes of glafsfor the reception of
' lamps. The furface of the bridge, is covered
j with find and gravel eighteen inches deep. On
; each Jide is afoot way paved with free Jlone.
The heaviejl waggons and artillery pass over
this bridge vithout making any fenftble agitation.
We have been thus particular in giving an ac
count of theJlruÃure ,coflls c. of the above bridge,
hecdufe -if is pofftble that some hints on the fub
jcÃ, added to a proof of the prachcability may
\esuHeftme of our country men to imitate, or even 1
improve the European plan, and render the th
â  vention ufejul to the United States, It seems
that a thing of this kind might be undertaken
with advantage in parts remotefrom theft a, and
in the â¢dicinity of forges.

sworn would be examined.
Mr- Lyon said, the reason which had in
duced him to requed some gentlemen to be
sworn who were present at the conversation
betwixt him and the Speaker, was, that he
did not think it had been related to his ad
vantage; but he had since thought it was
unneceffaty to examine them. If the com
mittee wilhed their examination, he should
not oppose it, but he had then no desire to
have it
Mr. Bracks having come into the house
he said, what he wished his colleague to'
prove was, that this was not the firft time
Mr. Lyon had had fracas with Members of
a Legislature.
Mr. Lyon said, gentlemen wished to blow
hot and blow cold. At one time it was said
he received affronts with impunity, and at
others that he was very irritable. He sup
posed the committee were already clear he
was irritable enough; if not, he was ready
to confefs it.
Mr Harper did not think this fort of
tedimony proper; as it would be introdu
cing particular faCls to impeach a man's
chara&er, which he was not prepared to
meet, which was not admitted in auy court
of judice.
The tedimony of Mr. Van Cortlandt was
not heard.
The clerk then proceeded to read over
all the evidence which had been given to the
committee; in the course of which, some
additional quedioni were put and answered.
The reading of the evidence by the clerk
being finifhed,) and all the queftioni put u|>-
on it which occurred to gentlemen,
The Chairman read over the refolutiun
which had been reported by the committee
of Privileges, for the adoption of the.house;
which was in the following words :
" Resolved, That Matthew Lyon, a
member of.this house, for a violent attack
and gross indecency, committed upon the
peffon of Roger Grifwold, another member,
in the presence of the house while fktisg,
be for this diforelerly behaviour expelled
therefrom."
Mr. Lyon rose, and fpokc as follows:
Mr. Chsirman, I feel myfelf extraordinarily
tircumftanced, and secidantully drawn into a
very f'erioui situation, merely by my ignorance â 
of the house of repieiVntatives being likely to
take cognizance of an aff.iir that happened
when the members of the nous* were at their
amusement and recreation ; when every one â 
wat doing that which was rijht in his own eyes.
Haw much I wasfupporttd in this opinion hy
the-condufl of the ip taker, every gentleman
may fee by hiÂ« teliimony. He fat in a chair
within the bar facing me as I stood without it.
He spoke to me of my country, and the conduil
ot'feme people there coacerning the flamp a<S ;
it appears, I turned the conversation towards
Connedltcut; it appears 1 kad four or five other
gentlemen's wit and raillery to bear, and this in
the hearing c f the Cpcaker.
Does this look like the house being fitting ?
How could I imagine this house was fitting,
when the I'peaker fuffered me;o he Interrupted
when fpÂ«aking,to him by the remarks and jokes
of four or five gentlemen ?
How could I imagine the house was fitting,
wh< n the speaker was joking me about an ern
baffy to Kjmfchatka amongthc fur tribe ?
How could I imagine the house was fitting,
when I heard, and knew the speaker heard Mr.
Giifwold insult me, without checking him ?
How cÂ«uld I imagine ihe house to be fitting,
when the speaker fuFe ed Mr. Grifwold to
proceed a second time *ith the mod provoking
insolence ?
Had the house been fitting, I should not have
been called on by Mr. Dana, with refpeA to
something Mr. Williams had kid, coul'equently
I should not have entered into any convcrfatron 1
about Consedlicut âthe speaker would not have
spoken to me of Vermont, and I (hould not have ;
again turned the fubjeift to Connedlicut.aed Mr. ,
Grifwold would have postponed his premedi-'
tated infuh : prtmeditated 1 fay, because it has
been pYoved that he had notice of my feelings
and my determiiaatinn on this fubje<3.
IÂ» it proper to fay ths house was fittifig, while <
half the members were Handing round the bar, 1
the speaker engaged m a jocular coil verfatio*,
and the tew who remained in their feats, either ,
ia private conversation or writing letters f
But, Mr. Chairman, it seems, bv the course '
thii bufirefs has taken in the committee, that 1 '
am to We criminated for fiolt-ing an indelicate 01 '
unpo ire conversation within the liea ing of the f
gentleman from.Conne<2 ; cut. Every one knows t
that there are two riiPiercnt opinions entertain
ed in this country with themamgc- (
ment of the goveromen', ami every one who
knows me, knows that lam very free in speak- '
ing my opinion on these fuljefts. Thee are (
many, and I believe fume in ths house, who t
know something of the rough, illiberal manner c
in which 1 have been treated ir. the New ling- t
land newfpaperi, on account of ii:y political o- ,
pinion ; and I believe there are many perfoni in
this house who are well acquainted with the \
kind of politeness which the gentlemen from
Conne&icut make use of towards their oppo- J
nents ; and some are acquainted with the (hare i
.| of politeness which thofr gen'.' p.:.:, . Jttve
f I from me.
; 1 If the house are at a los, on this fttHje.f!. 'hey
, will, I hopejâ.cur to the language maile use of
bv yir. Coit and Mr. Dana, in their tellimony ;
anff the house, I believe, will recollefl a speech
from a gentleman who fits behind me, in which
he told the committee twice or three titnes, that
I was no gentleman.
Again, I fay. Mr. Chairman, I am v.ry ex
traordinarily (ittiated. Evidence has beeti in
-1 troducedÂ»into tiiis honle, to induce the members
| to believe that I left Pel. Warner's regiment
.â  with aiiQienor ; that I am a perfow of difrepufe ;
. j that I have been in the habit of receiving insult
, with impunity. Here I am 350 miles from
home, and frnm the svidence who are able to
fcew to the contrary. Had I a reasonable op
portunity, 1 could j:rove, by the lieutenant colot
: nel, who is rt-ow general Saffbrd, and Jeveral o
iher officers of that regimentâthat when I left
i it, I left it with :he regret of much- the greater
. p n't ofthei'fTict:t-s,andall the soldiers. I mention
the lieut. colon. 1, because colonel Warner is
not livinp.
My certificate cf having fert.'ed my accounts,
which is at home, wculd prove my having done
my duty we'll.
Fcould prove my having taken my mufltet,
and mirrhed to the lines every day, during the
siege of Burgoyne I ftould not have mention
ed ihis circumflance, had not the fpealcer. men
tioned his liaving dons so when pavmafter.
I could ajHo prove, that when an officer offer
ed me an insult, I chastised him before the of
ficers of that regiment.
Mr. Champlin alked whether, the gentle
mrn said he had chastised an officer, or would
shaft !fe him ?
Mr. Lyon answered, that I had chastised
him.
I could prove that I took the commiffioa
in Colonel Warner's regiment, when I was
driven from my plantation by Burgoyne's
invasion ; that I resigned my appointment,
and left the regiment for the care of my fa
mily, for preferment, for honor, for supe
rior office ; and to serve the people of the
state of-Vermont.
I could prove, had I opportunity, that
I was immediately appointed deputy secre
tary of the State, payrnafter of the troops
of Vermont, assistant to the treasurer, aflift
ant to the cooiaiiflioner of loans, aad cap
tain of. the militia, befidfs being called on
to aft as private secretary to the governor.
I could also prove that within two years
from the time of that resignation, I was ap
pointed secretary to the governor and cohb
cil, a member of the legislature, clerk of
the house of assembly, one of a committee
for the colleftion and reviiion of
and to a number of other offices under the
authority of that state, beside a coÂ»fider
able number of offices in the municipal ef
tablifliment of the town in which I lived, as
well as my promotion to the. command of a
regiment, and all this before I formed k
connexion with one of the most trfpeftable
families in the state. I could prove also,
that I have been a member of the legisla
ture of the state of Vermont, except two
years, ever since, that I hare been appoint
ed to many other important offices which X
did n#: think proper to serve, such as audi
tor of the treasurer's accounts, and judge of
the county where I live.
By these things, and my {landing in this
house, I could prove that I have always
been refpefted in the Country I represent,'
and where I have lived these twenty-four
years.
The free eledtors of my diffiri& have giV
en me a preference to a gentleman of vety
great reachability, one who fefved fix
! years with unimpeachable fidelity jjn this
house, and is now ohief jiifticeof the state
of Vermont, yet evidence has been adduced
to fnew that I am a person of disrepute.
As to my being iu the habit of receiviog
; insults with impunity, for which it feemi '
> Mr. Chipman's teftitnony was introduced,
were I allowed to call testimony from Ver
mont, I could very easily prove fa much
011 this head as, perhaps, to draw in ques*
: tion in the naiads of lorae gentlemen, that
| refpeaabiiity which, in every other refpeft
I attaches to my chara<sÂ«r. Among other
things, I could prove that the gentleman
from Vermont, who was called to give testi
mony against me, has, with the politeneli
peculiar to a certain country which I will
not now name, insulted qac and received
due chaftileme'nt from m< for it.
Mr. Harper called to order. The gen
tleman from Vermont had already spoken
very improperly of witnesses, 3nd he now
spoke in a very reprehensible way of Mr.
Chipman. He hoped he would be admo
nished.
Mr. Otis differed iu opinion from the gen
tleman from S. Carolina. If the gentleman
thought it would be of service to him to
inform the committee that he had chastised
an officer in the face of his regiment, or
beaten a Judge of the Supreme Court, he
was right in llating the circumstances.
Mr. Harper said, if he wished to fee the
gentleman disgrace hmifelf, and the house,
he (hould not objeft to this mode of proccd
ing ; but he did not.
Mr. Lyon. It would be folly in me td
state any thing to this committee, thai I
cannot prove. Nor {hould I have mentioned
that circumstance had I not been charged
with receiving injuries with impunity. I ne
ver did receive injuries with impunity; nor
did I come here to do so,âl would sooner
leave the world. Mr. L. then'proceeded.
Were I to be allowed time to bring for
ward tellimony from Vermont,l could prove
that my character, as a man of spirit, Hands '
on such ground in my coustry, that I had
no need to defend it, by entering into a
squabble with fucn a chief justice in court
time.
If the proof of these things be eo&fidcred
of importance, t hope I {lull be allowed time
to fend to Vermont to obtain it {/or my
own pait I cannot so consider it, I mult
think that the House of Representatives
ought never to have taken up the matter,
of the difference between Mr. Grifwold and
myfelf, circutnflanced as it was ; and that
if the House thought otherwise, the due
fuUmiffion to thrir authority which I have
always stood ready to pay, ?nd the sorrow
whiÂ«h I have exprefled, and am continuallyf-rre as some mitigation of an offence ej-rrrl
t'nediguity of this Hopfc, which I never '
could hare knowingly been gi'.iity us. i
Mr. Lyon having finifhed reading his de
fence. ; '
Mr. Champlin rose and said, it was ex- t
prefsly declared by the constitution, that ]
'â¦ each heuf? may determine the rule of its r
proceedings, its members for diforr }
Vterly behavior, and, with the concurrence f
of two thirds, expel a member." And he
thought, they were called upon to exertife
the conftitmicnal power of expulsion, in
the present instance, by the refpeft due not n
oijy to thetnfehres as legislators, but to their p
constituents. And as they valued the repu- t
tation of the national legislature, both at e.
home and abroad, as they regarded the A- o
merican charafter,uninfluenced by the spirit v
of party, without taking into view the re- t
lative charafters of the person who offered,
and the person who received the insult, f
without attending to the infinite distance I
there was, between the em- and the other, t
they were bound to give their votes, upon o
the present occasion, undei the influence r
only of an high sense of duty and of honor, a
And under these impredions, he said, he
hdd attentively and impartially eonSdered r
all the circumftance3 of the present cafe, as t
they had appeared in And he r
found, it was that an offence c
of a gfofs and injurious nature had been a
committed by the member from Vermont
(Mr. Lyon) again ft ifye person of the mem
ber from Coonefticut (Mr. Grifwold) that 3
the conversation which produced an alterca- 1
lion between them origin?ted with the mem
btr from Vermont ; that it was a violent 1
asd groundless attack upon the public char- r
after of the member from Connsfticut ; in- 1
aftnucli as he was reprefen'td to be regard- '
left of the public good, and entirely aÂ£tu- 1
ated by lelfifh fordid views ; that this inde- :
cent attack upon his political integrity was '
repelled by a retort that the occafjon fully
juftifitd ; that in consequence of that re 1
tort, the member from Vermont committed
within these walls, and whilst the house was '
fitting, the gross indecency Rated by the '
committee of privileges, and of which the
very Speaker of the house was an eye wit
htfs. And that the member from Connec
ticut, whose cheek glowed with indigna- '
tioh, and whose arm was nerted by the de
sire of vengeance, recollecting the place in :
w'dich he flood, and the refpeft due from
Jlim to that house repressed his resentment. ;
Mr. C. then observed, that the paflions 1
ef some men, had their feelings been thus 1
outraged by the member from Vermont,
would hive made him expiate the injury up
on the spot. For this outrage committed
fcy him bid defiance to order and decorum,
tended to degrade the members of that house
from the rank of men, and to reduee them
to a level with the meanest reptile that crawl
ed upon the earth.
He was therefore compelled to declare,
that, in his opinion, nothing short of a vote
that woul4 deprive the member from Ver
mont of a feat in that house, could vindicate
the honour of it; which had been deeply
wounded through one Â»f its members. He
was aware, he said, that the punifhsient of
expulsion was a severe one. And there was
.no mart, who had the feelings appropriate
to that charaSer, and whose miatj was form
ed cotnmon materials, but would be deep
ly affefted by it. ,It mult fix a stain upon
kirn who foffcred it, for a gross and fc?n
d'alous offence, "that the waters of the ocean
could net wash away. It-<hould, however
be recollected, that it was no farther aif
graceful, than as an unquestionable evidence
of thf gross indecency ;hat gave occasion to
it. Apd if a Cacrcd regard tojuftice, to the
Â»eprefentative eharafter they full allied, and
to their own honour, required that they
(hould inflift that puniftiment upon a mem
ber of that house, they ought not to start
at the effefts of it. For if the member
from Vermont Ihould be compelled to re
turn to his conftituenU, loaded with the op
probrium necessarily attaahed, in the present
instance, to the punifhmeiit contemplated,
they wohIJ have only to rrst the difgrace
ful circumstance, the painful neceflity that
had led to it. They would have discharg
ed their duty, and the honour and dignity
of the house would be preserved.

From the New Torle Gazette.
Meffri. M'Lean & Lang,
LIBERTY is the agony of the dayâthe
rage for it is universal, and every thing Di
vine and Human must he new modelled to
suit the public taste.
Politicians, Infidels, and Enthusiasts, arc
united, (or appear to be united) in accelera
ting the arrival of Halcyon Days. Tyran
ny, civil and ecclesiastical, and indeed all
old fafhioned Rejlrainti upon the freedom of
Free Born and Noble MAN, will most like
ly be foou destroyed.
The Golden age must be cammeneing,
and the era of no government, must be at
no great diilance.
Reason and Philosophy are about to at
chievewondersâReafoa and Common Sense
will foori be difcarded'as uftlefs t'riflers !
No fpecics of (lavery (hail disgrace the
anfials of our approaching philosophic age.
Every man (hall do what is right in his own
eyes 1 Magistrates and Priests (hall be con
fidered'as usurpers 1
We .(hall require no Laws, as we (hall all
be Philofopbersâwe shall all be ftriclly mo
ral, and consequently will do no wrong !
Hir/.za ! Huzza ! May every citizen ex

Hymn to VENUS. No Rcligfon ! No
Priests ! .No Magistrates 1 What an happy

Indeed we (hall require no Teachers of any

Industry may then lay aside her various

But it is uncertain whether food will be

another candidate of Belzebub was added
to the infernal crew, charged with fettrng
fire to a dwelling-houfc, near the borders
of this county, while the people were gone 1
to meeting.
Last Friday night, an attempt was made
tohurn the goal in this town, supposed by
fdme of the criminals ; but after the fire
had penJtrated through the floor, and the
coals dropping on one confined in the dun
geon below, who finding his fixation rath
er critical, was ohliged to give the alarmâ
when tjh fc'ire was in a (hort time extinguish- ,

A NJRW AND IN TIRRSTISO WORK, IKTITLHD,
A TREATISE
ON THE POLICE OF LONDON,

aud E/Tcx ; for the city and liberty of Wcitmin
fier ; and for the liberty of the Tower of Lon
don.
'To those 7have read this curious and valuable
ri iv ill netd no recommendation âthey ino-zu its solid merit
-*âbut as it has bitberto got into very few hands in this
country, it -will nÂ»t he amiss to obferve âft great ivas the
approbation and demand in I ondon y that it P"ff<d through
three tdjge editions in the eourfe of twelve months. As a
detail of the ingenious variftitr of fraud, that endanger â 
[trhpcrly in I.on Jon and mofl other o\vara row* and opulent
citie*, it cannot fail to afford ike reader great cnlerta't. imer.fi
as "well as injlruflion ; but as the author traces all tbtfe
enormities ton feiv t and in tbemfelves x inconfderable eiuf
es, ftiisny of Hvbich actually exist in all the large capitals cf
the United States, the business is brought home to our oiun

fiveterufal.
TÂ» ajjiji the legislator and the magflrate in the humane
office of preventing crimes, and their confequat punijh
wftits, was tbi patriotic deftgn of the author. " Private
offences, befays, are the source of public crimes, and the
befl method of guarding society agamfl ibe Utter is, to make
proper provisions, for checking the former â u Those men
are easily fduccdfrom their Uya'ty who are apojlates from j
virtue.**
