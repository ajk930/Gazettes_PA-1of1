â f A very valaable Merchant Mill, Inc
' a DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and sundry STONE
il QUARRIES to be let.
I will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po
towroac, for any term not lift thanfeven, nor more than
eleven years, from the firft day of September next. The
mill-house is 42 by 40 feet, three stories high, built with
(lone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two gra
will overshot 18 feet water-wheels, and Evans's machinery arK
irg e complete, with Â«very other thing proper and neceSary for h!
ges, carrying on thebufinefs with dispatch, and at as little cx
' penfe as pofiible, all in good order. âFrom the mill to my
anding on the Potomac river, (wherÂ« craft, of any bur
then may deliver grain and take in flour) it is about 40 ~"
yards, and from thence by water to George-Town and
the City cf Wafliington, abeut 3 miles, and to Alexan
dria about ft miles. This fuuation, aided by a fuflicient
capital, will command the produce o(j a very extensive
back country, where large quantities us wheat and other -r
' grain is annually made, the diftante to it,being from 8 I
to 10 miles less than to any matket town up Â»n the navi- 0 f
gation of the Potowmac. There are on the premiles a a nc
large (lone Coopers'.(h Jp, a (lone granary, and a commo- put
dious miller's .house. At the landing aforefoid a bridge all
i& uo w_ iiiihJing aver the Potomac, which is in irreat for- kef
wardnefs and probably will be finiihed the erifuing fall. oui
There are also on the premises, a Brewery and Diftille- ~e'
ry, built with (lone, in tjiem are three dills, two copper#
or boilers, with every necessary article, all new, and in
good order, arid fufficiently Urge to carry on the Brew

W1 patch, is an iaimenfe quantity of building and foilnda

" more may be opened with ease : the done taken from thefc
quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
er ' to any other (lose brought to it. I will rent these quarries
â separately or together as may best suit.
On the top of the hill, and about 200 yards from the
mill, is a done Dwelling-house, large enough for the ac
-5 and commodation of a family : v also, a kitchen, dairy, smoke-

Adjoining to the Brewery and Didillery is a Smith's
(hop, in which is a complete set of Blacksmith's tools,
j'' t f which 1 will also rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
â- tenant two negro blacklmiths, one of them is a complete q(
workman. C
E If I rent out the done quarries', I will fell three crafts, c(

'* S/itly to lequiet, and to tie your vwn bujinefi."
THE Thefldilonians, to whom this rule was giv
en, were probably an inquisitive race, and, like the
men of Athens, fpe'nt their time in nothing elfebut
either to tell or to hear feme new thing. We mull
'frame fume such fuppefition, to excuse St. Paul
from the charge of impertinence : for nothing'can
appear more a wotkof supererogation, that to teK
iko, felfuh by nature, to live in peace, and to
pursue his own advantage. Nature, and the pri
mary laws of being, have told him so already.â
But this epistle, written at Athens, and sent to
Thefulonica, that is, from one tattling, idle city
' to another, was feal'onable and proper,-notwithftand
;:!Â£ all the fine reafoningto the contrary. Formy
felf, I can affirm confidently, that I nesd pot turn
jver the arehievesof the Thcffalonians to discover
a Eiillior. of cases, where men study to be reliefs,
and Â«'o pry into other people's business.
Impertinent curiofitv is, however, a vice of the
viihge, rather than of the city. I am futprifed
â¢ that Paul did not give tM direction in my text, ex
pressly to the cauntry people. For, though imper
tinence is not To local at sever to be found except
in cottages, still it is a faÂ£t, that the alkers of whys
and wherefores are generally villagers, arfd not ciis.
In town, strange fights are so. common, and the
tongues of fame so numerous, that each inhabitant,
diftra&ed with endless variety, thinks it better to
mind his own business, than ;e infpeci the acncerns
of z thousand neighbours. In the country, /exter
nal cirtumftances begin essentially different; hence
the manners of the people assume a different colour,
There the incidents are so few on whieh glutton
curiosity can feed, that even morsel noveltits are
seized upon with avidity. A farmer's purchase of
a iilk gown for his wife, or the irregular pregnan
cy of his daughter, 1 have known. to engross, for
weeks, the thoughts and chat of-thofc vacant and
meddling neighbourhoods, which disobey the pfe
cept of Paul.
A certain elegant fabtiHft among the Latins, de.
fcribts a race ot the busy-bodies, tunning wildly
jibout out of breath with inquiring, prying into
every nook, and, by their restless indolence, wea
rying tjiemfelves and tormenting, others. This is
a strong picture, and some might fay overchargedâ
a Dariy's caricature of manners, rather than the
natural strokes of an Italian. But I wist engage to
find the oiiginals of this>portrait in every village 1
visit. Men in the country, no less than in town,
have various schemes to execut*, and duties which
ought to be discharged. But, negligent of thsrfe,
and with the beam in their own eyes, they go'gr'op
ing about, to difcorer a ftiote in their neighbour's.
It is a mote, in general) that they gaze for most
earnestly, and it i 9 a mote that tbey magnify into a
mountain. â¢
This weak, if not criminal conduit, is generally
the firft begotten of jealousy aad rivallhip. The
malignant Inquiries that are then made of a neigh
bour'? fortune or fame, are veiled by an affectation
of impartiality and candour, But al! may discern,
that such insidious queries, 6re like attows discharg
ed from a covert, meant to deeply wound, and yet,
by their coutfe, not to betjay their archer.
What is it to thee, cÂ«nforious woman, if thy
frgil filter has lapsed by the way fide ? Doth her
fall shake thy foundation I and haft thou to bear the
burden of her suckling ? Gaze not at her infirmi
ty, nor circulate her reproach. Con over the ca
talogue oÂ£ own galantries, and, trust me, thou
wilt not have a moment left to read, or to coftpile
a scandalous chronicle.
What is it to thee, meddling man, if thyÂ«eigh
bcur's goods be attached ? haft thou to pay the fee,
of the officer ? Keep thy ledger accurately, and
peep not into his day-book v Ask not of his ap
prentices hew'they fare at their mailer's board, nor
hpw many dollars he takes m a year. Study to be
quiet, and to mmo thy own business, and thou wilt
find that thou haft little leifute to take an inventory
of another man's wealth.

NO speculation at prefjnt gives so much satis-
HFadtion to the French nation and their fraternity
in this jottntry, as the expedted bankruptcy of
England. Thomas Paine has published a sixpenny
panjphlet to prove, that Great-Britain is "* on the
-verge, nay, even in the gulph of bankruptcy;" and
all the boyifn disciples of Tcm Paine ars gaping
with admiration at hiivrifdom. Indeed, Paine's ta
lents for willing for illiterate minds, has neverbeen
exceeded ; and his pecaliar expressions and eompa
rifons, which are jfdapted to ordinary capacities,
and the only merit of his writings, are fubftitutej
for gc*>d sense and found wil'dom. Paine is 4 man
little reading and erudition; but he m?.kes that
little go farther than any man living. In theologi.
cal matters, he has colleÂ£ted Ideas about the bible,
that have been current among unbelievers for cen
mries ; and his objections to its authenticity, have
fcllbeen conlidered, by multitudes of philosophical
men, ages ago. Paine, so far from being original,
has not even the meiit of accuracy; for lie has
â made some gross blunders hi point of hiftarical fadt.
With refpeft "to his ideas of the BrÂ»tiÂ£h debt,
tie is nothing new, uirlefs it be his rate of progref
J :6 Â» Â»r._:Uiucreafe. The i_eafon why the expences of
every succeeding war ate increased and must incieafc,
an obvious one, and afubjed of common renaik!
The evils of com ing on war by anticipating the
revenues nf a nation, ale well known and umvcrfal
\y acknowledged. This fubjeft hag been well un.
tleritood and difcuffcd by many writers on political
â¢xonomy, particularly by Ivlt. Hume, in his chap,
ter.on public crctfk; Essays, vol. {. where Mr Paine
f.iaj had these evils more strongly marked and ele

He also find arguments in that philosophical
correci his own opinions iclative to the
e<,efl whieh bankruptcy wonld have on the English

'K yearsago, thrt tile nation was hastening to bank

( 4th year, Juhc 29, 1796. t
Citizen Diredtors, I
â  I have to give you an aceount of the new fuC- e
" ccffes, which the army of the Rhine and Moselle 1
> has obtained upon the enemy since the passage of
1 the Rhine. '
9 The eftablithment of the bridge, which was
r compltated on the 17th enabled us, to make the ar
' tillery and cavalry pass. Gen. Ferinot went itn
- mediately to tbwards Maeleti and Gold- .
t fcher, in order to afcenain the march of the corps
of Conde, which after our palling the Rhine pushed
very hard towards Offenburg. General Defaix at- <
taeked Vleanuhl ; which he carried with the great- i
eft bravery ; The loss of the enemy consisted in 200
prisoners ; and the lÂ»fs in killed aud wounded was
at least equal to that number.
On the Bth, the division of General Ferinot pur
sued his march against the corps of Conde ; he
crossed .the Shutter and marched towards Houg
horft and Langefhiaft.
On the fame day General 'Beaupois began his
march on the right bank of the Kintzig in order
to attack the camp at Wiltftedt': we met the enemy
at Goriih, ar.d obliged them to fall back with pre
cipitation to tlieir camp ; but when we came out
t of this village, the regiment of Cuirafuers of An- <
a fpach attacked the column in front with such fury,
f that they overthrew all what had patTcd the defiles,
s and who had not time yet to form, liotwithftanding
t all the efforts made to effect it.
The general of division, Beaupois, received 7
or 8 grievous wounds with the broad-sword, as like,
wife citizen Drouault, aid-de-camp to general De
faix. Two battalions of the 10th half brigade of '
light infantry, placed in the head of the village, by
a well airefted fire, soon put a flop to this attack.
Our cavalry soon recovered the momect of disorder
they haÂ« been thrown into j they in their turn at
tacked the Ouirafksts. wiA the" ~gtÂ£atcii bravery,'
drove into.the camp at Wildftadt, and bro't
back 150 prisoners, and 60 hoiles. They march
ed immediately against the camp, from whence the
enemy was diflo with the loss of on; cannon
and feveial caifloaiis.
The brigade of general Saiute Suaanne marched
this day towards Heltzheim and Lingt, the troops
behaved with their usual bravery. Enough cannot
be said in praise of generals Lafaix and Beaupois,
' and Ihe adjutant general Decamp. The latter, ill
'crossing the Kintiig, feeing a grenadier, ready to
s (frown, threw himfelf into the river, and fwimmiag
1 preserved to the Republic, the life of one of her
1 defenders. The chief of brigade, Fouconnet, who
f was wounded in this affair, has dillinguifhed hitn
- felf in a particular manner. Two pieces of light
- artillery, got between the enemy at the time the
, Cuirafliers made the attack, but not a single gunner
quitted his piece. The drivers distinguished them
, selves by the coolness wherewith they remained on
- their hoifes, where without the lealt means o! de- 1
1 fence, they were exposed tothe swards of the ene
t my, who wounded feveial of them. â¢ '
, 011 the 9th, the division of Feiinot 'marched '
aloiig the left bank of the Kintzig to -et into the j
rÂ«)ad from Offenburg to Friburg, in order to threa- ']
ten the enemy tp cutoff their retreat in this puint,
e and to harrals them on the left by threatening Of
, fenburg with an attack.
i The red of the army marched.ia 4 columns for
1 the purpole of attacking the catnp at jSolbcl, before
- Offenburg. The Si ft commanded by general Le
eonrtbe marched by the road of Willladt, and was |
l to attack the left of the position in froilt. Adju-
J taut general Decamp was to gain the foot of the
- mountains, ii> order to turn the right, but befoie he
i began to att he was to reconnoitre well 011 his left, 'â¢
: in order to be sure that general WurnÂ»fer's ar'my, 1

j The corps of Geqeral Suzanne fell in
likesvife with the enemy at UrtafFen,'drove ihem
off with the greatest frigor, and took about one
hundred ptifoners. Night prevented him likewile
froth pursuing his success. and the array remained
on the field of battle daring the most dreadful wea
ther; the enemy evacuated the camp at Bihel dur
ing the night. Seeing that it was impoiliole for
the enemy to form a junction with the corps wÂ£/
Wurmfer, General Ferinot at day break-took pol
feffion of Gffenburg, and pursued the enemy, who
left, him two pieces of caanin and some oailTons.

I cannot, citizen Dire&ors, fufficiently praise
the bravery of t"he troops and the general officers
who commanded them 111 all these attacks made one
after the other with -iroops not yet organized, but
who were nothing but detachments, joined by
forced marches Irom the different 4' ri 'ions of the
army, who were next to fend them for the passage .
of the Rhine.
The rapidity of this march and the several at
tacks as the neceflary consequences thereof, have
prevented the junftian of the two armies which thÂ» â >
enemy had on the Upper and Lower Rhine; and
the want of uniformity, which this must occaGoa
for some days ia their operations, promises us new

THE merchants and inhabitants of the town of

Although the Indian country has Ufcen involved

well secured from depredation, ar.d his life as invio

tranquillity ; and latterly, when a well known cause
had aimed placed this country under the mod un
propitioits circumstances, which the horrors of war
can impose, we have reason to believe that your
wife and temperate measures landed in no incQcfi
derable degree to avett the calamities of impending
misfortune.
Advantages of such an ir.eftimable nature are
not the produftlons of chance, nor the common
phenomena of natural causes; we therefore assume
that they are referable in a high degree to the a&-
ive vigilance, wisdom and humanity of your cha
raÂ£ler.
The affable and polite deportment of the officers
of your regiment eptitTe them to our warmed ac
knowledgments; and'tothofe of the royal regi
ment of artillery and engineers, our thinks are e
qually due.
Captain O'Brien will long be remembered for
his readiness and affability in the duties of his office

NEW-YORK, September 12.
Extn& of a letter from a merchant in Stratford,
(Conni&icut) to his friend in New-York, dated
9th inft.
" I have been op part of the night in confe
queni e of an alarm from Newfield, occasioned by
the most (hocking tranfaftion 1 ever knew in thip
town. AHont ten o'clock at night, the dore be
longing to Mr. Isaac Tomlinfon, which we used to
OCT upy, was discovered to be on fire ; the neigh
bours were called, and put it out, when they found ;
a boy lying in the (lore was murdered, by being firft
knocked in* the head with a (hoe hammer, and then
his threat cut. The (lore was robbed of a sum of
money, which Mr. Deferred, the owner, fays, was
about one thousand dollars. The inhabitants mus
tered out in all direfiionsâtwo came to me, and I
got a number out from here, and sent to dop all
the passes, to prevent, if possible, the escape ef the
villain or villains. The store was set on fire, no
doubt, to prevent discovery. It is. fuppefed the
b(>y let some perfÂ®n or perfons.mte the store, as
there was (landing on the counter, near where he
lay dead, some liquor, and the nppearance of some
one having been drinking. The boy was (Jreffcd,
artd with his hat on. I have as yer, this morning,
heard nothing further of thi6 melancholy bufinefa."
Extract of a letter to_a friend in Salem, dated Bil

Convention have petitiort the king of Spain for li
berty to march 70,000 men thro' Spa in into Por
tugal, Captain Eainey has taken the command of
three frigates, and failed for Cape-Francois. I fell
in off Cape Ortogal with 1 v fail of the line, by whom
I was boarded, and treated very politely, morefo
than I have -ever been by the English. This fleet
were in pursuit of 8 fail of the Enghrti, l'uppofed

We are authorifcd to inform the public, that the
two commifliouers for fettling the true St. Croix L
river, as the boundary line between the United p
States and the Biitifh territories, have chosen Eg- o

lioner; and have dispatched n veffei to this port to
conduct him to St. Andrew's, where they are to
convene, far the accomplishment of the bufinefa.â B
The e'xprefs has arrived here. Judge Benfon is ab
sent in a northern county, aniadvices are forward
ed to him. Whether he will accept or not we can!
i not inform the public.
It gives us pkafure to heat of this amicable a

r they have fallen upoa so diflinguifhed and impartial S
a m in as judge Bcnfon. S
From eaptain Tailman, of tke brig Commerce,
arrived on Saturday from Cadiz, which place he ir
left the 29th July, we learn, that a few days be
fore he failed, a French cutter arrived there with a S
Portagueze prize, laden with wheat, from Barbary C
, bound to Lisbon. The French vefTel obtained o
much credit by carrying in her prize through the p
i English fleet, which was llretcbed across the bar- v
1 bour.

but fays, that the Eiglifh merchants there had con- '
veyedmolt of their pcrfonal property t6 Venice and 5

Citizen Directors,
I have the honour to inform yon, that the divi
sion of the army under general Klebei, left Duffel ],
dorT on the 28th of June. The division underge ]
rieral Grenier passed the Rhine at Colognt on the
29th, and joined tl.e tfÂ»oops under Kleber. This J
corps arrived en the 30th as Sieg, on the left bank
- of which the eijtmy had Rationed about 1200 light'
1 trooÂ»8. Adjntant-genual Ney attacked with his -f
v ufua! impetimfity, took about sixty of the ca
valiy, bdides killing and wounding a tolerable num '
e ber. The lb:* regiment of ChalfeHis exhibited the
- ilrongeft proofs of courage in this action and per- 5
I foriHed all their movements with the greatest celerit)
> and preiifion. ' , , 1
General Klebei* halted, otr the Ift of July, or
3 thelÂ«ft bank of the Sieg, in order to wait the arris
val of provisions, and to give time to general Le- c
r febvre, who had dtreftcd his march to Siegen, Ui
reach the place of his defoliation. This division oi f
t the aimy had ordtrs 10 advance this day in front of [
- Ukeradt.
In order speedily to eflefl my junction with ; gen. t
Kleber, I made that division of the army which was -
encamped between Coblentx and Andernach pals
the Rhine this morning. The paffsge was perfor
med in prefencc of a corps of 5 or 6000 men ; the
f whole of which would have been made prifonrrs of
war, had it been possible far the cavalry to qryfsthc ,
liver footer. As it was, we took two pieces of j
camion; and about 200 prisoners.
To morrow I fhsll have the honour-to fend y4B
the particulars of this affair, in which ieveral regi
ments and several officers distinguished ihemfelves. ]
I have ordered one column to march to Monta

then endeavour to bring the enemy to a general en- I
