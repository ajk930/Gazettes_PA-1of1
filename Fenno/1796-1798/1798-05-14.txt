LONDON, March 15.
To the intelligence which we yesterday re- i n;
ceiÂ»ed frdm Plymouth, of the preparations ad
making in France for a fpsedy descent on this wl
country, we have to add the substance of inu
formation brought by a Teaman who bad been
prisoner in France, and who arrived at Fal lc
mouth on Friday last in a cartel. He ftateii
the French force in Brest harbour and Bred g\
water to consist of twenty one or twenty-two
fail of tbe line, about eight of which were
nearly equipped,and â¢he greatest diligence was
employed in fitting the remainder far fca ; f e
one of these failed on the 6th instant into the ft
otter road, in which lay eleven frigates, a as
corvette, and three arnrrd brigs. The sri- fe
gates were ready for sea. ''
No letters have for these three or four ''J
weeks been received from captain Cotes, out j 0
agent f.r prisoners in France, from-which ir w
is concluded, that his letters are intercepted w
by an order from the direftory. _ V
Private letters from the Hague mention, te
that the Batav an governmrnt dejmuri toac- '
cede to tbe ptopofitiort of the'ex;cutive dir
e&ory, for prohibiting the entry of any mer- ir
chandize tv goods from Great-Britain. Eve- n
j-y person conversant with the trade to Hoi n
land, knows that the Dutch cannot even sub- It
fift without a cpmme.c al intercourse with Â«
this country. _ t :

By the lafi accounts from Sir R. Strachan, Â®
who is now blocking up the port of Havre, it Â£
appears that there are nine frigates and cor-
vettes in that port ready to put to sea.
From Brelt we learn, that there aie twenty
fail of the line in that port, of which 18 are
fuppoled to be fit for (ea, and of those 9 were '
ready to (ail at a moment's warning j of Havre,
it appears that there are nine frigates and cor- J ,
vettes in that port ready to put to sea. There
are.also a very considerable number of gun
boats, but nothing gpes in or comes out- }
since Sir Richard's squadron has remained off
that port.
The Berwick, ot 74 guns, with 10 frigates c
was in the Outer Harbour with fails bent on 1
the 4th of this month, and the whole seemed 1
to be preparing for sea, but wehave not heard
that any of these veilels have yet come out.
Yesterday government ifTued a proclamati- 1
on, offering a reward of zool- to be paid by 1
the Lords of his Majesty's Treasury, tor the ;
apprehension of Robert Thomas Crofsfield, ]
charged on suspicion of being guilty of. high
treason. Crofsfield is the fame person who .
was in custody some time since for having
caused a poisoned dart to be made, which it
was supposed was intended to have been <
thrown at the King when in the Theatre.
We have rcafons to believe that our pre
parations for secret expeditions, which are
now carrying on, create the moil serious ap
prehensions in the French rulers, notwith
standing their pompous and arrogant threats
of invading and subjugating this country.â
We are confident, that the carrying the pro
jected expeditions into prompt execution will
not only tend to rouse the spirit of English
men, but perplex and appal our insolent and
implacable foe.

On Satnrdgy morning Mr. Fabiarti and Mr. con!
Hyde, two ot his majelty's messengers, arriv- lier 1
ed in town with dilpatches from the Loid nnit

"Yesterday at eleven o'clock, one of his
rtiajefty's messengers, attaoded by a civil and p rQ ,
military power, proceeded to the liouCe ot Mr. an( j
Oliver Bond, in Bridge-street, upon aniin-
formation which hail been received by Oo
vernm'ent, that the Provincial Committee ot
the United lriflimep of Leinfter were toaf
lemble there for the purpose of treason. /
" A committee of fourteen delegates were g pa
found fitting, |nd immediately taken #ito S p a
custody ; aud many material pSpers, contain- p re
ing proofs of a serious nature were found up- r j es
on them. Mr. Bond was not in the 100 mot -j
the meeting ; but papers atfe&ing him are finc
said to have been found in his pocket. We con
have not yet received a lift of the delegates t j le
nor any particulars of their examination.
" At the fame time we understand*, Dr.
M'Nevin. was apprehended at his lodgings
near the Four Courts ; and Couiilellor Em
mett in Stephen's green, John Sweetman in yal
Francis flrcet, and Henry Jackfonand Son in the
Church ftieet. Warrants were alio said to
have been issued for apprehending Richard w | (
M'Cormick, Councellor Samson, and Lord t j lv
| Edward Fitzgerald. Lord Ed-ward was miff- c
ed by the person who" had the warrant against
him, tho' lie appeared in many-parts of the t jj e
town âThe othsrs are not discovered. nel
" The murder of Mr. Buckley, a gentle- c j e
- man residing in the neighbourhood ot Naas, j > j 0
s adds one more to the horrid afl'affinatjons t[)(
s which disgrace this country.** V 3
The above information is confirmed by f Q[
privite letters, except in the inftanre of Coun- Â£ j Â£
1 (ellef Emmet, who has fled ; and so has Counr
iellor Sampson and Lord Edward Fitzgerald. f Q(
S 1 The following extract of a private letter j Â£(
t gives some further intereftfhg particulars : u
j "We have been in great dismay and con
, fternation during the loli 24 hours. Yefter- co
" day a party of military searched Leinfter houte p
for Lord Edward'Vitiegerald, who had been
> seen walking in the llreets at his ease only a
e (hort time before ; b>it the search was in vain to
1 as he had escaped. While the military were
. feafching Leinfter house, Oliver Bond, and
16 others, were taken up as they were fitting
i.i council, and were conducted under a flrong - 0
guard, As the Lord ChancÂ»l- 'gj
1 lor was returning from thence to his carriag, g,
r which was in the street, the mob outside
d who were numerous closed round him so as to | 1(
prevent his parting ; on which, one of the.at- j s
1 tendants requested him to step into a fliup till
/ the crowd was dispersed. This he refufed to c(
' do, and putting his hands into his pocke ts,he â 
drew out a pistol from each, and holding them |
in his hands, declared he would shoot the firft 0 |
- man that obftruited his paflage. On this the C(
I mob gave way, and opened to the right and
>. left, leaving him room to pass to his carriage,
h which he did without further obftrnftion. â f
About 5 o'clock his Lordship walked through
the streets alone, (hewing a presence ot mind -
lc and a degree of courage, which has always
y charaCtenfed him. A
s- " Every day brings further accounts of new
ii murders ; and the report has been very gene
-ral here, that St.'Patrick's day was marked 0
for the deftrndtion of the well-affeÂ£ted, and t
of every person immediately connected with j

[1 (piracy, have been deltroyed. Those who
are taken up haVe been lodged some at*KK- t
r.' jnainhain gaol, and others at the Custom- j
rp House. â  ~ v
Â»I am happy to fay that Sir Man- \
\' t nix, who was reported to be dead, is recover- g

"It is said that Lord Edward Fitzgerald ef- -f
escaped by jumping out of a window, and that 1
>n he was seen to take the road to M&nawar ; r
d but it is not thought that he can escape the t
rd kingdom." [
On the receipt of the above advices, a t
:i- Council was l'ummoned at Lord Greville's a
iy Office, which fat four hours-in the evening ; c
lie and yesterday, when the service of the Cha- f
d, pel Royal was over, a Council of the Cabinet 1
rh Ministers was held on th*e affairs of Ireland, i
ho at which the Duke of Portland, Earls ot t
nr Chatham, Spencer, and Weftmoreland, the
it Lord Chancellor, and Mr. Windham attend- <
en ed. The deliberations (which had been pre- 1
vioufly discussed the preceding night at lord
â e- Greiiville's Office,) continued about 20 mi
ire nutes ; after which the-Duke of Portland and I
p. the Lord Chancellor had a conference with i
h. the King till 4 o'clock ; and in the evening, 1
ats Mr. Hyde, the Messenger, was sent back to
- Dublin Cadle, with orders to use all poflible ;
0- expedition. .
/ill The following circumstances relative to the
fh- news from Ireland are sent to us by a corref
md pondent :
The advices are of a very serious and alarm
ing nature, and contain an account of the
ar- dilcovery of a most horrid plot to facrifke
the kingdom to the views of the French Re
public. â¢ '
In consequence of the evidence which had
hat been produced fiom papers found in the pof
iif- feflion of the persons now in custody in this
:di- country, by which were alfi/implicated many
Ider persons id Ireland, Government thought it
I aavifeable to direct
ron Warrants were accordingly iUued, and the
jrm house of Mr. Bond searched, where sixteen
los persons were apprehended, and their papers
mer seized. Edward Fitzgerald was in the
into house at the time, but there being no warrant
[ ot for his apprehension, he could not then be
taken into custody, and thereby escaped.
den The papers fejjied are said to be of a most
ling treasonable nature, no less than to give up
jinft the country to the French. The day fixed
for upon was Saturday last, the antverfary of St.
:he- Patrick, which being kept as a tefhval, it was
imagined that advantage could be taken of
the inebriety of the people j and an attemp
J. was to be made tofeize all the principal offi
cers ot the government. It was expected I
un- that rlie French Would have a force ready to
lart. co-operate with the Irish rebels, and thus
decide the revolution by a coup de main.
(t. Mr. Pyle and Mr. Major arrived 111 town
and yesterday morning from Irtland, with fflrther
difpatclies. Lord Edward Fitzgerald had
not been taken when they left Ireland.
It was last night currently reported, that
the kingdom of Ireland was put under marti
al law.

h about five hQndred pounds worth ot Merchant

1- brought with them fire in order to slash pow- 1

when they came into the store, Mrs. Francis '
1- saw the fire, bid the poor unfortunate boy to 1

f- -fire on the head of the powder calk, whereon 1
at lay some scattered grains ot powder which im

he the head of the powder cask, it was open,
from which the powder on the inside took fire,
a blew <up the store, and two dwelling houses
:'s adjoining, one belonging to Evan Francis, the
I; other to Stephen Ra(kliff; there were sixteen
a- fouls in the house, the two boys were killed

On mtttion rf the fame gentleman,.the hoÂ«fe tai
went into i committee of the whole on the re- co
port of the fame committee on the petition of o ji
James Peri y, for fevmfclf and parttitrs, who ~ de
proysfor compenTation for certain fupphes laken na
from their iron works at Spotfwood, in New
â  Jersey, in the course of the war, on the ground
of himfelf and partaers having been out of the lai
country liiice the cooclufion ot peace. The re- wl
port of the committee was unfavorable, and was th
! coscurred in, by the committee of the whole, l al
and by the house. f e
Mr. Sprigg called up the report of the com- f
mittee appointed on the fuhjeÂ£l of Post offices
! and Poll-roads. It was read, and states that it
\ will be inexpedient to make any alterations in hi
: the law relative to Post offices and Post-roads at m
prffent. fu
' Meflrs Dawfon, Sprigg and W. Claiborne,
each exprefled their disapprobation of this report
" and concurred in blaming thecommittee for hav
ing so long delayed making- a report, and for
j having now reported in this way, though very d
many petitions had been presented for the altera- e<
tion and addition of roads, and as there was a
1 surplus revenue ariling from the Poft-office of j.
50,000 dollars. ,
1} Mr. Thatcher did noÂ» think the committee
were chargeable wjth deliy v for as they conceiv- P
1 ed, from time to time, that there was not fuffi- li
n cieut ground, for making any change in the pre- I;
f sent law, they waited to fee whether any thing g
(hould arise to change that opinion, and when n
i thecommittee had been applied to by the gen
- tleincn who tiaa exprelica their dinppronation ot j.
I. this report, they were repeatedly desired, if
:. they thought the committee ought to report, to _
ie call upon them by way of Tefolution. Mr. T. tl
y said, upwards of 3000 miles of new road had f
been applied for, and from the best information c
:) he could get, not any road of 50 miles in length r
is would pay one half the expence of carrying the
:o mail. Upon an average, he believed, the roads .
1- applied for would not pay 15 per cent Â»f the ex
le pence. A few (horter roads might pay more a
in than half the expence. He was as desirous as any f
1- gentleman of extending the post-roads as faft t
>n as poflible ; but he thought once in two years, t
11, which had been, the custom heretofore, was of- j
e, ten enough to take Â«p this fubjeift. 7000 miles
es of new road had been ordered to be made at the
ie last winter leflion, which, he believed, would not 1
:n pay ao ppr cent of the expence j and at he be- 1
:d iieved there were 10,000 miles in the United j
as States which had as good a claim for poft-roadi ]
w as the 3000 applied for. and though there was j
Â£â¢ at present a surplus revenue (not so great howe
-e ter as had been ftateil) as he was apprehensive j
'd from the conversation he had held with the pÂ»ft
it> maiter general on this fuhjetfl, that the circum- <
>fs stances in which this country might expeift to be J
: h inv> lved would lei Ten the revenue arising from ]
r y the poll-office, he did not think it expedient to |
L| e go into the fubjedl at present. Mr. T. said he
th was totally udeoncerned as to himfelf whether
ht the report was agreed to, or not ; but if it was
he disagreed to, and referred to the fame commit- ]
r - tee, he Ihould not think it right to make any
' le other report on the ful>jeA at present.
ir " Meflrs. Harper, Oallatin and Blount, each
n " exprefied their disapprobation ol the report j and
Ir. Mr. Macon and Mr. T. Claiborne (the other
d- two members of the fcleÂ£l committee) their
en opinion in favor of it.
ir - r #he question on agreeing to the report was
fe, put and negatived 38 to 3 1 .
Mr. Dawlan moved that the fubjedl be re-,
comaiittedâagreed, and a committee of seven
: ' ie mepibers appoioted.
ers Vr. Livingfton,, from the committee appoint
ed to enquire into the expenditure of money in
an ' the Naval Department, informed the house that
that committee had received a number of state
ments from the head of the Department, which
Â°y he was move to have printei.
0 Mr. Otis thought the printing of 1b large a
volume of papers, which he did not think one
member in tlfty would ever read, would be an
ufclefs expence- Mr. Gallatin advocated the
printing, aflur ng the gentleman from Mall'a
~ chufetts he lhould read every one of them, as
he was desirous of knowing how the money
which had been appropriated for this obje& had
been expended.
The motion was carried.
Mr. Champltn presented a petition from the
sets, inhabitants of Newport, praying that attention
v may be paid to their fortifications, so as to fe
â cure that town agaiitft the attacks of a foreign
enemy. Referred tothe Secretary of War. ,
On metion.of Mr. Harrifon, the house went
into a committee of the whole on the.State of
clc. the Union, for the purpose of taking up the bill
frpm the Senate, for authorising the PreOdent
!.t oflhe United States to b*ild or purchase a num
â' berof small vessels', to be equipped as Gallics or
otherwise ; which being aereed to, the bill was
lira, K one through without debate or amendment.â
The committee refe, and the bill was ordered to
be read a third lime 'o-morrow.
' On motion of Mr. D. Poller, the house took
up the report of the committee of claims or,
t. the petition of Robert Parker, praying for com
-5 pcnlalioa for dry geodf fold to the state of Geor
gia, for the use of the United States. The re
port was unfavorable, and was concurred in.
Mr. Harper, from the coramittea, of ways
and means, rxade a report in purfuanceof a re
solution referred to that committee on tha 6th
ult. diredling them so enquire and report whe
ther any and what additional revenue will6e ne
ceffarv The report was read as follows:
Â«< That in their opinion it will be jiecefla
rv to raise the sum of two trillions of dol
lars, by a tax fan lands, houses and Haves,
to be apportioned among the ftveral states,
according to the cenftitutional rule, and on
the basis of the late census ; the mode of as
sessment & colledlionto be uni form through
out the United States.
" This opinion they have founded on a
view of the probable amount of the ordinary
expenditure of thi present year, and of reve*
nue from the existing taxes, prefenred by
certain statements frÂ«m the Secretary of the
Treasury, w(iich, together with the letter
of the committeeto him on that fubjeft. and
his answer, are subjoined to this report
" From these statements, it appears, that
the ordinary expenditure of the present year,
making an allowance of one hundred thou
sand dollars for occasional grants, and one
hundred and thirty thousand for reimbnrf.
ing the unfunded registered debt, and the
payment of did accounts, will amount to fix
millions, nine hundred and twenty fix thou
sand, four hundred and sixty dollars
" And that the revenue from existing
taxes, stating the impost and tonnage duties
at seven millions of dollars and the internal
duties at seven hundred thousand dollars,
will amount to eight millions, eleven thou
sand, eight hundred and ninety-fcven dol
lars.
" The impost and tonnage are stated at
something more than five hundred thousand
dollars below the aftual receipts of last year,
which' were seven million, five hundred and .
forty-nine thousand, fix hundred and forty
nine dollars : an abatement which the Secre
tary has thought it prodent to make on ac
count of the'effe&s Hkelv to be produced. T
Oft that great branchrftlie revetwe by tie
"depredations on our commerce. The inter- . ..
nal revenues are stated higher, by a funi #f
one hundred and twenty fivg thousand dol
lars, thau the adlual receipts of the lÂ»ft year,
which were five hundred and feventv five
thousand, four hundred and ninety one dol
larsâThis encreafe, the Secretary suppo
ses, may by expe&ed from animprovedmode
, of colleftiort.
" The stamp duties are stated at two
1 luindred thousand dollars annually ; an efti
t mate which the committee conceive to be
fufficiently moderate.
' " Taking the total amount of revenue ,
1 from all the present branches of it, to be
r eight millions, eleven theufand, eight hun
y dred and ninety seven dollars, as above stat
ed,"and dedufting^,that of ordinary expen-
I ditiire, takenat fix millions nine hundred and
twenty fix thousand four hundred and sixty
dollars, there will be a clear surplus, in the
â¢t present year, of one million eighty five .thou
- sand, four hundred and thirty seven dol
:- lars, which, if left unappropriated would
S go to the discharge of the public debt, bui
n may be applied towards defraying the ex
b. ..li'n-.. y Â»ntÂ«i during the pre
sent session. - > j
0 " These expenses- confitt of the following
\ items : Fortifications, three hundred and
d forty thousand dollars, Fabrication, or pur. .
Â« chafe of arms, cannon and military stores,
nine hundred thousand dollars. Naval arma
'e ment, nine hundred and fifty thousand do!-
' lars.New regiment of artillery, one hundred

Â« To this it will be proper to add, a lum

ds lery. And (hould the bill, now before thÂ«
as house, for providing gallies, be agreed to
e " an expeofe of eighty thousand dollars will
be incurred on that account. These two sums
n . added to the former, will raise the aggre
be gate of extraordinary expenses, to two mil
m lions, four hundred and eighty two thou- .
t0 sand, one hundred and forty two dollars,
he m The committee have not taken intÂ®
er view the' expenses which may incurred for
tl)e military defence of the country, either
ay by a provisional army, or detachments of
militia. It is certain, however, that which
ch ever ofthofe modes may be preferred, aeon.
fiderable expense, in cafe of aitual ferviie,
er must be incurred ;it will be for the house to
E ' r decide, how far a provision for this expenle
ras ought now to be comtemplated
" Neither have the committee taken into
â e-_ their estimate. a provision for the deferred
ren debt; the injereft and extinguilhing annuity
on which, amounting to one million, one
nt " hundred and forty fix thousand, three hun
l'Jl dred and fcvtnty dollars, will become paya
ite- ble in the year 18m ;jnorfor the heavy in
ich ftalments on the foreign debt, which wil
become due in the years 1802, 1803, an
e * 1804. But they conceive it is of nfe ta
3ne state, that those instalments, joined to the
interest, which, in this year, are only fix
fla C hundred thousand and forty one dollars, will
as amount, in the year 180J, to one milii.n,
ney nine hundered pnd one thovlfand, ninehun
had dred and thirty one dollars ; âin the year
1803, to two millions, fix hundred and for.
ty one thousand, four hundred and fifty
the three dollars;âand in the year 1804, to two
millions, fifty two thousand, fix hundred
â¢i gn and twenty three dollars âAfter which,
, they decline to one million, thirteen thou
rent s an d, two hundred and thirty two dollars,
eof in the year 1807 ; and to two hundred and
. biU fifty four thousand, five hundred and twen
ty dollars, in 1809, when tha debt will be
sor extinguished. Hence it appears, that in
was I the year 1801, the ordinary expense wi
t.â be encreafed one million, one hundred ami
dto forty fix thousand, three hundred and seven
, ty dollars ;in the year 1803, to the amount
too,{ of three millions, seven hundred and eighty
â¢om k ven thousand, eight Hundred and twenty
feor- three dollars, being the sums payable, wthat year, on the foraigti and deferred debt*,
âwhich sums it will be necsffary to pro
vide, in those years, above the ameunt of
the pretent ordinary expenditure.
" T* meet the above mentioned extraor
dinary exp-rnfes, amounting to two millions,
four hundred and eighty two thoafand, one Â£xt
kundred and forty two dollars, Congress has
no present funds, beyond the surplus alrea- {
dy stated, and amounting tÂ« 0114 million,
eighty five thoufarid, .four hundred and thir- don
ty seven dollars, which being deduced from day
the aggregate of extraordinary expenses, j
leaves a balance of one million, three hun
dred and ninety fix thousand, seven hundred
and fire dollars, to be provided by new re- WI
venue. at
" The committee Woiild also observe, that Mr
two inftalmcuts on the debts to the bank of to
the United States, amonnting to four hun
dred thousand dollars, and not continued on
loan, will become due on the 31ft of De- cel
cember, in the'prefent year. It will be fÂ»r on
the house to consider how far provision for
the discharge ef those inftalroents ought now
to be made. Should such provision be con
sidered as neceflary, it will raise the amount P u
to be provided for by new revenue?, to the to
sum Â®f one million, fcven hundred and nine- or ,
ty fix thoufartd seven hundred and fire dol- g Q
" This sum, it will be obferve4> fa^ s co^"
fiderably (hort of the proposed tax,âbut in di J
the present situation of the country, with to
such probability of increased expenses ; such F|
poffibilhy, not to fay probability, of defal-
cation fn the graateft branch of the present ,
revenue, the impost and tonnage duty ; and Â»
the certainty of the great augmentation in le
the ordinary expenses, by the deferred debt t J.
and the encreafing instalments of foreign j
debt; the committee do not think it fafe
to contemplate an additional revenue, from '
permanent sources of taxation, to a less a- h
mount than two millions of dollars. nr
On this view of the fubjeS, they submit g[
<o the hoofe the following resolutions
j, ~ That itw-*H be expedient
to wife an additional revenue of
dollart, annujilly, by a dirtii tax. ft
3. " Resolved, That the said tax ought
to be laid, by uniform afleflment, on lands,
houseS and Haves. . r
3. " Resolved, That the apportionment
of the said tax ought to be made among the
several states, according to their refpe&ive â¢
number of inhabitants, as afcurtained by
the last census." . t
Some pbjeftions being made to this re
port by Mr. Bayard and Mr. Ghamplin, 011 i
the ground of its not having been laid be- \
fare the committee of ways and means finse t
jt was drawn up by the Chairman,(and Mr.
Ha'per declining to withdraw it)it was re
committed to that comisittee. c
Mr. Sewall, from the committee for the 1
protection of commerce and the defence of ]
the country, who were inftrufted to enquire j
and report whether any and what alterations
were neceflary in the Naturalization AÂ£t,
and into the expediency of establishing by
law regulations refpe&ing Aliens arriving
or residing within the United States, repor
ted as follows :
THAT, by force of the aft. intituled, "
An aft to establish an uniform rule of natu
raliÂ«atibÂ», and to repeal the aft heretofore
pasTed on that fubjeet," aliens are admitted
to become citizens of the United States,
when, in tlie opinionof this committee, there
is not fufficient evidence of t,heir attachment
to the laws and welfare of this country, to
entitle them to such privilege : and that, for
this purpose, a longer residence within the
United States, before admission, than the
aft provides, is essential, and ought to re
quired. The committee are also of opinion,
that some precautions against the promiscu
ous reception and residence of aliens, which
' ' may be thought, at all times, advii'able, are
at this time, more apparently tieceffary and
important, especially for the securing or
removal of those vvko may be fufpc&ed of
hostile intentions.
On these fubjedts refpe&ively, the com
mittee beg leave to recommend the follow
ing resolutions :
1. Resolved, That profifion ought to be
made b)y law, to prolong the term of refi
dencewithin the United States, which (hall
be proved by an alien, before he (hall be ad
mitted to become a citizen of United States
â¢r of any state.
2. Resolved, That provision be made, by
law, for a report "and regiftiy of all aliens
who shall continue residents, or shall hereaf
ter arrive within the United St-ite?, with
suitable descriptions of their places of birth
And citizenlhip, and places of arrival and re
sidence within the United States.
3. Resolved that provision be made, by
law, for the apprehending, securing, or re
moval, as the cafe .may requite, of all aliens
being males, of the age of fourteen years
and upwards, who shall continue to reside,
or shall arrive within the United States, be
ing natives, citizens or fubjefts of any coun
try, the government whereof shall declare
war against the United States, or (hall threa
teri, attempt, or perpetrate any invalion or
predatory incursions upon their territory, '
as soon as may be, after the. President of the
United States shall make proclamation of
such event. Pioviding, in all cases were
such aliens are not chargeable with aftual
koftility, that the period fettled by any
treaty with such hostile nation, or other
reafonablf period, according to the usage
of nations, and the duties of humanity, shall
be allowed for the departure of such aliens,
with all their eflefts, from the territory of
the United States ; and excepting all cases
of such aliens to whom paiTports or licences
of residence may be granted, confidently
with the public fafety.
This teport was referred to the commit
tee of the whole on the state of the Union.
â¢ ' On motian of Mr. S. Smith, the house
went into a committee of the whole on the
bill to continue in force part of an aÂ£t there
in mentioned ( relative to the revenue cut
ters) which was agreed to, and ordered to
be read a third time to morrow.

there yet remained a sense of justice and
er magnanimity which would nof permit the pâ
ut administration of that country to turn a to]
ne deaf ear to the complaints of violated friend- ?Â«â 
(hip ; nor could it be supposed that the ou '
friendfhipandthe justice of that governmeat â¢
had expired at the fame moment, and were
succeeded by a system of avarice and cor- t,
nt ruption unparalleled in the tyftory of na
,e _ tions.
In this state of anxiety, common to
themselves and their fellow citiiens, your
,a - memorialists have perufed'the inftruaions fe '
ie, of the President to our envoys extraordina- vc
rv at Paris, and thair communications and hi
dispatches on the fubjeft of the negociation
ny
with the French republic ; and they cannot 1 n<
ta " refrain from exprefling, in the most firm
He and decided manner, their full and complete
is conviÂ£lion of the good faith and sincerity j
with which the executive has endeavored to
cultivate peace and harmony with that re- B
lin public, and the spirit of moderation and lib- -
00 erality which has charadlerifed his pursuit ~
us of those obje&s ; and also their warm in- J
dignationat the humiliating treatment which
OU r country has received from a corrupt ad
miniftration.âWhiift our public agents
it have experienced jhe nsoft insulting negleÂ£t,
the sacred ear of our country has been I
'du- wounded with infamous proposals which it
and is degrading to have- heard ; and menaces v
have been offered, which the spirit of A- i
r - merica equally defpiles and defies. Our
tninifters of. peace have been refufed an op
the portunity of exprefling the amicable wi/hes
ehe of their country ; they have been direfted (
to solicit the acceptance ps bribes and tri- '
butes topurchafe from perfidy a promise of
' tl,cr jullice ; the power and kaughtinefs of
Â° l C j France have been displayed to them, whiift
jt J their country is threatened with the fate of
Venice, and a price is put upon their na- (
tional exigence ;-and the great and enhght- "
cned people of t(Vet*: states have been ca- 1
lumniated as base, degenerate and divided ship
balancing their country's ('ear bought hon- Sch. ;
or. against their wealth ; and regfcrdlefs of S
her independence whiift they are occupied 1
only in the fordid pu'rfuit of gain.
Under the impression of such accumulat-
ed injuries, with a spirit of patriotism to g
guide them which never has forfaken, and Sloop
they trull never will forfake, the virtuous S
citizens of this rising repuhlic s your me- I
morialifts have no hesitation in declaring |
that we are not a divided people ; that on
queftioas which- involve the honor and indc- g Q Q f
pendence of the United States, or measures e <j.
which oppose the happiness of their coun- from
try to the demands of a foreign nation, there orc J
can be no difference of and whist J
they repel with indignation every tnfinua p fea)
tion so derogatory to their national honor, g a j
they pledge themselves, with the assistance f
of heaven, to their children and their coun- Bilbc
try, by every tie which can bind the affec- T!
tion and fidelity of man, to refill with fiim- isarr
ness every invasion of their rights, and to
transmit to their poilerity, sacred and invi- (
olatc, the freedom, honor and independence j
of their country. 1
Your memorialifti therefore deciare, that c
they are ready and willing so support tveiy
conflitutional measure of the government, Arj
which may be necessary to secure these in- Horse
valuable objects. 9 1 ! 1,1
