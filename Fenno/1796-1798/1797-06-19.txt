)s) MY DEAR SIR,
in lAM informed that the Officer com
-0 â  manding your escort, has enlisted several per
-- ions, residents of this government, which J
jj being a g, a '"ft the laws of nations, I cannot
I, pass unnoticed, it being an infringement on
â  s the sovereignty of the King my rnafter, and
r. a Regard of the authority refidihgin me.
rt _ Ica not persuade myfelfthat it was done
intentionally, nor thinking that it could
r e g' ve the most remote offence; but as the 1
| e matter is of a most delicate nature, I re
quest yau to give the necefiary orders, that
e the men so enlisted may be discharged, and
'* delivered to Major Minor, whom I conlmif
h fion for this purpose.
objeft of the escort not being to
raise men in this country, while under his '
s Catholic Majesty's dominion, I reqneft of '
â you likewise to give. the most precise and
, positive orders to the officer of the troops,
1. or to whom it may appertain, to difoontinue *
1, such proceedings, or any thing that may ir.-
e JUQ. the immunity of the King's dominions,

t The most perfeft harmony arid friendfhip
subsisting between his Catholic Majesty and.

being recommended in the most particular"

it would be unaccountable if we, that have

, and keeping to one another the prerogatives,

CONGRESS.
â¢ HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
: FRIDAY- JUNE 16, '
A meffagc from the Senate informed the
i House that the Brefident had signed the
A&s which originated in their House, for
1 prohibiting the exportation of arms and
ammunition, afld for preventing privateer
: ing
-1 The bill to provide for the fafety of the
' ports and harbours of the United States,
J was read the third time, and about to be
. pal Ted, when
f Mr. Williams observed that he should
- vote against the bill for the following rea
â  sons, viz. because it contained a clause a
' dopting a principle which he conceived to
be both unnecessary and unjust, with ref
pe&s the State Debts ; because he did not
, believe the State of Hew York to be a
f debtor State : and because the adjustment
1 of the expences ot the war, had been made.
" upon the most erroneous principles. Each
" State he said ought to have- been charged
j with'the requisitions of Congress, made du â¢
ring the' war, and the interest on ar,y defal
-1 i cation of payment in each requisition, and
e t credited with the sums paid, and with such
- other supplies and payments as were pur
" chafed or paid in conformity to aits of
Congress ; but every claim, such as the ex
l pence of the expedition" to Penobfcot, the
! frigate South Caro;*ia, and' such as was
f admitted ought to stand as a charge against
t the United States, and to be paid out of
= common flock. (The Speaker reminded
1 Mr. W. of the qiieftion.) Mr. W. said if
' this objectionable clause could be modified
I | so as to call on the debtor States for the
â¢ j furcs a(!b:r,ed, and accredit States who had
expended money 011 the fortifications, he e
then ftioutd have hopes of an accomodation f'
cfpecially with the State of New York, he
therefore moved fov recommitting the bill,
so as to have these objqdts embraced. t
Mr. Brookes objected to the passing of (1
the bill on the fame ground, and supported t:
the ipotion of his colleague. v
The Yeas ami' Nays were taken on the 1

A yil from tl* Senate, for the protec- \
tion of the trade of the United States, was
twice read, and ordered to be committed to 1
a Committee of the whole on Monday.â a
This bill goes into the detail as to the man- 3
ning of the frigates, fixing the pay, rations, ;
See. and also empowers the President to 1
equip nine additional vessels, if he shall fee <
necessary, not to carry more than 20 guns 1
each, to be employed in the proteftion of t
our trade. > 1
.Mr, Varnum moved to have theconfid- t
eration of this bilT postponed till the firft (
Monday in November ; but was informed 1
his motion was not in order. t
.Mr, W. Smith moved the order of the ;
day on the bill ft>r raising an additional corps <
of artillery. 1
Mr. Gallatin moved that the Commit- 1
tee of th e whole be discharged fur- j 1
ther consideration of this bill. He made : 1
this motion, he fnid, for the purpose of 1
shortening the difcufiion ; because, if it '
should be the opinion of a majority, that it j
was not proper- to go into the consideration j
of this fubjeft at present, there would be ; '
no use 'in going into a Committee of the
whole. He did not think, it connected with
the business upon which they were especial
ly called. To carry it into effeft would at j
least cost 300,000 dollars, and no adequate !
benefit would be derivec from it.
Mr. Williams said, before he voted on '
this queftipn, he should be ghd to hear ;
from the Secretary of War what was the
present number of our troops, and where !
the.y were stationed. At present he was of
opinion that the men we had were fufficient; ;
though he allowed it was necessary that time j
fhoukl be -given for artillerists to learn their
duty. He should vote for going into a !
Committee of the whole. '
Mr. W. Smith objected to the motion, !
as, if carried, it would amount to a reje&iou |
of the bill. He was against it, because he
conceived the bill to be necessary ; and he
thought it would appear to be so, from the
! argument of the gentleman himfelf who
i brought forward this motion, as he had told
them, when the fubjeft of fortification was
under -consideration, that if 115,000 dollars
were appropriated, it would be necessary to
have additional artillery to take care of the
new forts. He should, therefore, to be
confident, withdraw his motion. The fame
gentleman had yesterday said this corps
would cost 400,000 dollars a year to-day
he liid three ; but Mr. S. said, he had a
. calculation, by which it appeared it would
only cost 200,000.
Tie gentleman last tip had wished for in
â¢ formation as to the stationing of the present
: corps. He had in his hand a letter from
the Secretary of war to the chair
| man of the Select Committee of the Senate,
i who reported this bill. ( He read it ; from
whicl it appeared that there were 350 pri
vates at the differeat forts oa the Atlantic,
aad the remainder on the Western Frontier)
Theft 350 men were said to be necessary to
keep the garrisons in repair, and that no
part !>f the men on the Western Frontier
z could be detached from thence, as it was
e probaUe their presence prevented a
r War or the frontier from Tennessee to Geor
i gia. To (hew the neceffit'y of- force on the
- frontiar, Mr. S. read a letter and affidavits
from louisville, giving an account of a mur
e der ani other disorders committed by the
:, Indiari. ,
Â» BtfÂ»re the late reduflion Mr. S. said, the
numba: of the privates in our eftablifnment
i was 4980, and when the 832 additional
1- men proposed to be raised were added to the
[- prefeni establishment, it would be less by
o 1132 men than it then was. He hoped
therefcre they -should go into a Committee
it of the whole, and finally agree to the bill,
a as he vifhed not only to have men now to
t keep the works in repair, but to use the
e guns, if there should be occasion. .
h Mr. Nicholas observed, that two rea
d sons wtre given by the Secretary of war for
i- this actional corps ; one was, that there
I- were ipt men enough to keep the works in
d repair ; the other was, that it was necessary
h to havfe ifcen to use the guns, if necessary.
-- With lefpeft to the moaey voted yesterday
if for fortifications he understood it was in
:- tended to be expended on the forts already
e built, aid not that new ones should be built,
s When these forts were firft erected, nothing
!t more was. contemplated, than putting so
if many inert into them as Wonld be able to
d keep them in repair. They were built in
if populous parts of the country, and if they
d were attacked the inhabitants would be rea
e dy to froteft' them. The militia of New
d J York, Philadelphia and Baltimore, he doubt-
Ed not, tii cafe of danger, would ijocktocje â  w '
fend their fortifications. I ta
Mr. N. read a letter of the Secretary of tl
War.in January last, ia Which he raeiltioncd tl
that the fortifications were generally in good g'
(late, except a few on which the ravages of tl
.limp had made some inroads, and which o
would require 4,000 dollars to repair. He In
thought this account and thi present were* U
at variance. He wi<h;d the Secretary x>f â -
War had said (and if he meant to have gi- al
gen information to the House, he ought to si
have said it) how many men were hi this re- 01
gimeut; because, if it were full, 55Â° al td- fc
lerifts would be oa the Western frontiers, f{
which he could not believe were neeeffiiry.- b
He believed the truth was, the regiment was "
not more thaa two-thirds full. Mr. N. de- t;
nied that our eftablifhihent' would be less by ii
1132 men, if this corps wafc kidded ; for tho'
the establishment had appeared larger pn r
paper, it had never, in faft", exceeded 3,000, u
or 3500 men. He believed there had not h
been any aÂ£tual reduction of men. Nor c
did he believe the gentleman from- Penlifyl- p
vania was far wrong when he estimated the u
proposed new regiment at an expence of tl
400,000 dollars per year, as the constant Â£1
annual expence of the establishment was
from 12 to 1500,000 dollars. When mean
fures of this kind were proposed, they were d
persuaded they would colt nothing, but o
when they were gone into, the expence was r
found continually to i'nereafe. He hoped b
they should not go into a Committee of the t
whole. , h
Mr. Brookes thought it was firft neceffa- n
ry to enquire whether these additional men n
were necessary. He thought the vote of t
yesterday conveyed some "idea of danger, f
and if defence was neceffary,lt mull be al- c
lowed that forts without artillcrifts would n
do no good; but gentlemen seemed to go â¢ t
upon an idea'that there was no danger. lls v
thought differently, and he believed a majo- t
rity of the House thought so. He denied v
that militia-men would be proper to be pla
ced in these fortifications, and allied gentle- a
men how they v could answer to their con Iti- t
tuents, if they went away without doing 1
any thing, and an attack should be made up- r
on our coast ? He thought nothing had tar
ken place in Europe which placed us in a
better fitu3tion ; but that we, on the con- a
trary, should be doubly vigilant. He truft-. t
!ed they should not be lulled 40 sleep by fair c
; representations. He was for going into a t
! Committee of the whole. . i
| Mr. Varnum supposed the gentleman last t
jup had received some new information, since 1
!he put his negative to the i>ill providing for 1
the fortifying of ourports. What that in- i
I formation might be, he' could not tellâHe 1
had received none. The gentleman from 1
! S. Carolina had indeed rftid some papers t
! giving an account of a murder on the- si on- 1
j tier by the Indians, and of.a woman firing 1
' at them. But was this a fuificient reason for t
; raising a frefh regiment of artillerists ? He 1
believed not ; they sometimes heard of mur- <
! ders among civilized people ; and therewere <
modes of punishment, without the aid of mi- i
, litary force. He believed when the present
j regiment of artillerists was fall, there, would
be men fufficient for every pvrpofe. The 1
! measures of gentlemen Mr. V. said, went
) to a deftru&ion of national credit, by pufh
j tug every expensive objtjft they could lay.
j hold of. The United States had pledged
themselves to make good engagements at
certain periods ; he thought these should be
firft fatisSed, aad then, if there were any
surplus, gentleman might, perhaps, be in
dulged in a favorite measure. If indeed,
there was any foundation for what had jfal
len from the gentleman from Connecticut,"
that we were on the eve of a war. then, in
stead of 900, it would be necessary to raise
150,000 men ; or if we were to declare war
upon France, in cafe she did certain things".
1 He did not, however, believe that gentle
man's do&rine.
It was time, Mr. V. said, that the fenfr
. of the people should be exprefTed to the
President of the United States, in favor of
â  peace, that no irritable measures might be
: taken. He did not believe there was any
1 danger of war,except from provocative mea
sures on our part. (The Speaker spoke to
, order.) Mr. V. concluded with fayftig he
1 hoped the bill would not be committed.
Mr. M'Do vel l^vas against going into
, a committee of the whole, because additions!
I men were unnecessary for the peace eftablifh
> ment, and if war was contemplated, they
> would be wholly inadequate. Militia, he
r said, were the proper defence of this coun
-3 try, and deprecated the idea of a Handing
1 army which was the sonftant attendant upon
- despotic governments.
: Mr. Harper said, if the bill were to be
s reje&ed, he thought it ought firft to under
- go a difcufiion in a committee of the whole.
: Did the gentleman from Pennsylvania shrink
from an examination of the principles of this
e bill ? Or was it because he was unwilling
t his negative should stand against it! If he
1 were not, he thought he ought not to en
e deavour by a fide-wind to throw it out.â*
y Why, said Mr- H. was the bill pasTed for
i fortifying the ports of the United States,
e if men were not to be put into them ? They
, would be useless, and their conduft would
> appear ludicrous and absurd. He could ac
; count for this mode of aftiirg in gentlemen
who had determined to do nothing for the
1- defence of the country ; but for gentlemen
r who voted for fortifying, he could not dif
e cover their consistency in being opposed to
n this measure.
y Gentlemej cou'd not be serious hi sup
- posing that the liberty of this country Would
y be endangered by 900 additional men". In
1- expreffmg an opinion of this kind, they
y shewed a low opinion of their constituents.
:. Gentlemen had frequently argued as if we
g were to hold our liberties at the will of the
o French nation, but he could not have fup
o posed they would have exprefTed a fear of
n this kind*
y But if there-were danger, gentlemen said
1- the measure would not be effectual. It could
.v not be supposed tliat these men "were to pro
test the country against invasion ; no, they
wÂ«rÂ« to prote& our tea-ports again it the at
tacks ot" privateers and: pirater. Some gen
tlemen fay appearances are tlattetiilg, and
there is no appreheniTon ot danger. The
gentleman from Maffachufctts said we were
threatened witn war, and fubiniffidii could
only fecnrfr.us in peace ; so that we were to
hy ourfelvps at the mercy of an offended fo
teigrter t ,and fay, " Wehave been very wr-ong,'
and beg you will spare us." He attributed
all this to a wiifh to prevent measures of de
fence from being taken ; for in one way or
other, every defen'fi've operation was opptv
fed. On the. contrary, he wished t6 shew a
spirit to repel the injuries we had received,
by putting inns into our hands, and frying,
" We mean to do juffice, but to repel at
tack," nor could he fee any ciufe of offence
in a conduÂ£t of this kind.
Mr. Shepard said, if thete man\tere not
railed, many of the fortifications would be
, useless, and denied that putting our fortVarid
harbors in a ft ate of defence, coa'.d give juit
cause of offeiice to the French. He said the
plan of fortifications was originally laid out
upon too large a scale, and would not allow
that militia could be used to advantage in
fortifications,
Mr. G.'les did not believe that these
men were raised with a view to any present
danger, but that advantage had been taken
of this season of alarm to increase our milita
ry establishment; he was therefore against it,
because he believed the present eftablifliment
too large by one half. "Gentlemen, he said,
had been charged with taking humiliating
measures ; but he thought it was more hu
miliating to tike a measure of this kind, on
the ground of danger, than to oppose it,
from a conviAiOn that it was meant to in
create the peace establishment. The gentle
man last up spoke like a hero ; he truftad
â¢ they should all aft like heroes when danger
was at hand ; but at the distance he now
thought it, he saw no use iu the gentleman's
vaunting.
If this bill parted, he said, there wo\il<fbc
a necessity for going into a fyftenj of taxa
tion, The 115,000 dollars voted yesterday,
he believed, might be got ont of the present
revenue ; but if they went any further, taxes
must be laid to meet the expense.
Mr. Dana said, the question was whether
any part of the bill before them was proper
to be adopted. He thought as it was a bill
of an important nature, and being sent to
them, by the Senate, they should at lea ft go
into a discussion of it. It had been said
this measure was intended for a peace estab
lishment ; if it were pfoper for a peace estab
lishment, it could not be less proper for us
in our present fituatidn. But it was said to
be inadequate to resist the attacks of a fo
reign nation ; so that gentlemen would have
no force, except an" efficient one; He be
lieved we had not more aftillfery'in our re
volutionary war 1 ,. than we should have, if
this regiment is raised; and as, the gentleman
had given no reafoa why he thought half
our present eftahlHfiment" would be fuffici
ent, he.'would excuse him if he thought dif
ferently.
Ms. D. did not think the gentleman from
Pennsylvania was warranted in his expecta
tions from the present situation of . Europe.
He thought the refufal to honor American
paflports was alarming.
Mr. Ki'ttera said when they' firft met,
it was pretty generally believed that it was
necessary to put the country in a state of de
fence. This bill went He had
two reaforis' for wishing the measure to be ,
difcuffcd ; one was, because the President
1 had recommended it ; the other, because
the Senate had thought the business fuffici
ently important to pass a bill upon it.
Mr. S' Sjfli.TH had not determined how
he should vote upon this question. The
. present corps of artillery, he said, was raised
when the country was threatened by Great--
. Britain, when the Indians were at war with
us, and when the governor of Canada had
given us reaibn to expeft a war. It was
then thought necessary to erett fortifications,
, and an add tional regiment of artillery was
raised to what wa3 already in being, which
made a corps of 990 men. These weretho't
( fufficient. Since that time peace had been
a made with the Indians, and we had got
possession of the posts from the British. These
) required a few artillerists. He wished the
j secretary at war to fiiew how many men
were stationed at each of the posts. He
believed the number of men which was said
[ to be cn'thc Atlantic frontier was fufficient
to guard the forts, were always
excused from labor. It had been said mi-
J .litia coutd nyt be employed, because unfkil
le9 in the business, but he said the laborious
â part of artillery could be taught in a few
days. For want of the information lie had
alluded to, he was a little at a loss in the bu-
finefs ; but when the late President (a milita
s ry man) had thought the present artillery
fufficient for that season, he could not help
believing they were so for the pijfent time.
With respect to American pflÃorts being
annulled by France. There were vessels

' own- coiifuls might have countersigned. It

n An argument of the gentleman from S.
e Carolina (Mr. Harper) was conclusive with
n him for not wishing to go into this fubjeft.
(- He stated there was only a surplus of 30
o â or 40,000 dollars of revenue (though he
was of a different opinion) and this objeÂ£t
would require at least 500,000 dollars.
d Mr. Gallatin said, when he brought
n this motion before .the Koufe, it was not, as
y had been stated, to get rid <>f the fubjeft by
s. a fide wind. They hod been three day 6 up
'e on a bill, oi small importance when compared
ie with this, in proposing and reje&ing amend
)- and he thought it would save time to
jf -determine at once upon the principle of this
bill. He juftified the measure as parliaiften
d tnry. If he could have conceived, it would
Id have occafioried so long a debate, he believed
3- however he should not have made it; and if
j there was any one fr.an ju the Hoyfe whowouid fay he had not ir.cde uj> jiis'inind an
the fubjeft, he-would withdraw his motion.
In relation to the principle of the biH. It
had obferved that lie had said yefterdiy
that if the iij,ood dollars were agreed to,
this bill hiuft also be agreed to. It was true
he had read the letter of the secretary of
war On the fvibjett, and predicted, that if
thai sum was agreed to, it would be brought
as an argument for agreeing to additional
artillery ; and the event shewed that he was
tight
With refpeft to our prsfent situation from
the-late tranfa&ions in Europe, he (hould
fay nothing. It was mere matter of opiuion
which operated differently on 'different minds
acceding to their habits of thinking, or
pÂ«rhaps their prejudices.- Nothing could
astonish him in this refpjft, after what he hat!
heard ip that Hoirfe.
Granting, iiowever, the danger to Be
possible, whidn he did, he would'afk whether
the prefer.t measure was calculated to repel
the danger ? He believed not ; but on the
-contrary, that it was calculated to weaken
the union. The danger apprehended was
war ; but he did not believe "that those who
feared war, e:;petted an invasion ; and if not,
the present measure was not calculated to
meet-the danger. To defend the sea coast,
tlie inhabitants nuift man their forts, and up
on their own exertions their fafety must de-Â«
pend. He supposed, if war was made upon
â¢ Its, it wqnld be in that part in which we
" were vulnerable, and not ia that in which we
were invulnerable. The attacks of anv so-
reign power would be upon our trade. The
United States were impregnable to the at
tack of any foreign nation ; they had ten or
fifteen years ago refilled, those of a more
powerful nation, with refpeft to naval force,
than the one about which we were now a-
lanned ; when-the population was much
less, and much left compact, and when the
government was very imperfeil. He there
fore looked upon any fear of an invasion as
grourtdlefs ; and if there were attacks upon
our commerce which were apprehended, a
nevf regiment of artillery could have no ef
â¢ feft. The operation of such attacks would
fall upon our merchants and upon our reve
nue. Every additional expense, therefore,
not calculated to repel the danger, will di
minish our means for repelling it in the pro
per way, which would be by means of fri
gates, gallies, and vessels of every descrip
tion.
He believed, with the g?ntlenvMi from
Virginia, that this was not a war measure,
but merely an attempt to -increase the army
eftabliihment, which had always been a fa
vorite objeft with those gentlemen who seem
ed to flaisn an exclusive right of supporting
government ; and yet he knew of nothing
which weakened it more. He was not afraid
of troops impairing the liberty of the people
of the United States ; but he believed no
thing tended more to weaken the hands of
government-than the want of woney, and
nothing consumed To much of it as lair*
litary establishments. That the secretary at
war fliouW \vflh to l'ncreafethe establishment,
he did not much wonder at; it was natural
that he fhoujd do so ; but his opinion ought
not to guide them. -Mr. G. concluded by
faying, that if it were necessary to have this
additional number of men for the purpose of
having them trained in the artillery business,
he had no obje&ion, if the fame number was
lopped off the infantry.

to a Committee of the whole on the state
of the Union, upon the resolution which he
laid upon the table some days ago, authori
sing the President to purchase a certain
quantity of arms.
Mr. W. Smith suggested the propriety
of referring the matter to a Seleft Commit
tee, as there might be matter connected
with the enquiry made, which might not be
proper to be made public ; an Â«n quiry ref
pefting the quantity of arms in pofleflion of
the United States, and where lodged, was
somewhat of a delicate nature. *lf it was
referred to a Select Committee, they could
determine apon the propriety of making the
fubjeft public.
It was agreed to be referred to a Com
mittee, and a Committee of Five was accor
dingly appointed.
Mr. Harerp laid two resolutions upon
the table to .the following effect:
" R'fohied, provision ought to be

and calmness which the good ministers of

when the Dominc fal-vum sac Re gem (God

thundered out this verse with alltheftrength
of lungs he was master of. The people re
mained silent and amazed. The Curate
immediately ordered the Church doors to be

INCIDENTS AT HOME
The Senate of the United {States }, ave

Prnfident. It is exprefiive of natiortah'ty,
and of high confidence in the talents and vir
tue of our firlt officer. The house have re
ported an answer ; which, in the usual way
has originated much debate. Mr. Nicholas
has made a luke-warm proposition, calcula

ergy, with which the Representatives have
exprefTedthemfelves.ontliefubjeft of France.
Mr, Smith, from So'jth Carolina', with his

loquence, advocated the reported reply.â
The abilities of Meflrs. Harper and Grif
wold were likewise displayed on the fame

theclofe stile of Tacitus, and in in more
than one particular, Roman. Its tone is
high, and indignation is with the ftrifteft pro
priety, the word employed to express the
feelings of our political guardians, on the
fubjeft of French aggression. It is said,
that Tom Paine, the modern Jack Cade,
wrote, before he left Pari*3, another little

reported that an English frigate of 36 guns,
and a Spanish of 44 had a severe engage
ment, and that the latter struck to the En

Yesterday arrived fchr. New Adventure,
capt. Samuel Lightburn, 4 days from Netv
Providence, who mentions that a schooner
had been brought in there under American
colours, with 11,000 dollars in specie on
board.
The following authentic information is re
ceived by captain Cooke, from a corref
pondant at St. Mary's.
Tgiun of St. Mary's, in Georgia,
May, 17-97.
Yesterday, returned to' nis place, James
Seagrove, Esq. commifiioner from thfi Uni
ted States of America, to the government of
Florida; and Thomas King, Esq. agentfrom
the state of Georgia. These gentlemen have
been at St. Augustine, for a month past,
during which time an agreement took place
for an exchange of all fugitive Haves from the
United States, or his Catholic majesty's pro
vince of East Florida, from the 2d Septem
ber, 1790, until the 19th instant. All fu
gitives, prior to the 2d of September, 1790,
remain to be fettled by the king of Spain
| and the United States.
It is with pleasure we inform, from un
doubted authority, that Mr. Seagrove has
entered fnto a treaty wk?i tiie SpSnifh go
vernment, whereby a total ftcja is put fci* aIL
fugitive slaves, or servants, being people of
colour, ftom' receiving countenance or pro
tection'in Florida. Should any fucli people,
go there, on being diil'overed, they, will be
thrown into priion,.until demanded "by their
owners, when they will be delivered upV
This Treaty, we are informed, extends to
Horses, Cattle, and all other property, that
Inay llray or be stolen, and be taken intci
Florida, are to be returned without delay or
expeuce. The United States are recipro
cally bound to t'l â  Spanish Government, so
soon as the Prefidcnt and Senate' of' the:
fame, {hall approve and" ratify this Treaty.
" Twenty-fiven of* the American Fugitive
Slaves -were brought to this place on the
22d inft. in the (]oop Harriet, Capt.' Cooke
from St. Auguflsrie, well secured in irons.
They are now fafely lodged in the new pri
son in this town, until proof be made by their
owners. Eleven runaways are left in prison
in St. Augustine, as hostages for the return
of an equal number now detained in Geor
gia, belonging to Spanish fubje&s. A lift of
the negroet delivered up, will be forwarded
to be publiflied. _ The commiflioncrs speak
in high terms, of the polite treatment they
experienced froiti Governor White, as well
as from Gentlemen ir.ciiv 'duals. There ap
peared a great def're in the government and
many of the fubjefts to have these runaway's
sent back, as they had become so great a
nuifarice to 'that country, that molt of them
were chained, and at work among the con
vifts.
Yesterday arrived here, Em an Oil R.en

FOR carrying into cffc<Sl the sixth article the
treaty of amity,commerce and navigation, con
cluded between his 3ritannic majesty and the United
States of America, Â©Q tlie 19th day of November,
1794, having this day constituted their Boardj
pursuant and agreeably to the said treaty, do here
by give notice, that they are rc.idy to proceed to
bufind's accordingly; and they desire that all claim#
un ler the said article (which so far asthe fane de
scribes the cases thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
They further desire that all such claims may rot
only state in what manner the several cases come
within the description of the said article, but also
Specially fet'forth .he nature of the evidence by
which the claimantsrefpeitive'y undertake tofub
ftantiate the fame.
Ex'.nit from the {aid article,
" Whereas it is allcdged by divers Bri:i!h mer
" chants, aud ethers his majeft) 's fubje&s, that
" debts to a confid rabla amount, v\ hich were bona
" Bde con traded, before (he peace, still remain
" owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the
" United States; and that by the operation of va
" rious lawful impediments, liner the peace, not
" only the full recovery of the said debts has been
'â¢ delayed, but also the value and security tftereof
u have been in several instances impaired and less
" cltd, so that uy the ordinary course of judicial
" proceedings, the British creditors canuot now
" obtain and a&uallv have and receive full and
" adequare compeufation for the loiT s and dama
" ges which tney have thereby fuf ained: It in a
" greed that in all such cases where full compenfa
" tion for such loiTes and damages cannot for what
" ever reason be adudly obtained, had and recei
" ved by the said creditors in the ordinary course
" of justice, the United States will make full and
" complete compensation for the fame to the said
" creditor# : but it is diltirxftly understood, that
" this provision is to extend to such losses only as
" have been qccaftoned by the lawful impediments
" aforefaid, ard is not to extend to losses occifion
" ed by such insolvency of the debtors or other
" causes, as would equally have operated to pro
" duce such loss, if the said impediments had not
â¢â¢ existed ; nor to furh losses or damages as have
â¢â¢ been occasioned by the manifeft delay, or negli
'â¢ fecncc, or wilful omiflTon of the claimant."

where he is ready to receive all claims or injiru&ious
for claims with, the vouchers aud documents thereof,
for the purpoie of bringing forward the fame agree
ably so the rules and orders which the board may
think proper to prescribe.
And ai it will be for the interest of all concerned-,
that the several claims be so dated, and support.
Ed, as to prevent the delay which would arise from
the fiecediiy of obtaining further information, or ad
ditional materials,from perfonj rcfiding
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (tor the
direction chiefly of those, who, not having employ
ed particu*' agents, may leave the profecuticui of
their claims tÂ» his charge and management) that all
lucti ought in particular to fct firthâ
ift. The proocr tirfcripiion and fitnation of the
creditor or claimant, enct debtor,
ivcly.
ad. The date or nature of the original contrafl or
debt.
3d. When, in what manner, aod to what extent;
the creditor or claimant w. $ prevented or impeded,
by the provifirm, operation or defect of law, the
decisions and pi attire of courts, or rettrain! of exe
cution, from recovering payment of the debt in
quo&ion.
4th. The loss and damage incurred or sustained,
in consequence of such impediments, whether the
fame may have irifen from the inlolvetrey, change of
situation, or death of the debtor, the loss of legal
remedy from laple of time, or other causes impairing
the value and security of the debt, which wouid not
have so operated if sUch impedimenta had notrxiftcd.
The particular grounds and reasons ou
which the claimant maimains, in the terms of the
treaty, that " by the ordinary course of judicial pro
ings, the creditor cannot now obtain and actually
have and receive full and adequate compensation" tor
the loffesand damages fofuftatued.
The general agent thinki it his duty farther to sug
gest that the ftvcral claims ought to be accompanied
and supported by the affidavits of the claimants duly
sworn and regularly attested, both as to the exigence
of the dtbts claimed, and such other circumitances
as may be within their owri knowledge relpettively.
And Wherever the claimants it) Hating the nature of
their evidence (which must in every inftanctf be the
best of which the cafe is capable) have otcafion to
refer to the teltimony of witnesses, it will b.e proper
to appnCethe general agent of the names and places
