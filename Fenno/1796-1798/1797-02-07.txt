' rs * FRIDAY, January 13.âContinued.
Mr. Harper said, they had been informed farther
tevenae was wanted. Every gentleman who had
l,g advocated a fyttem of direst taxation, had taken
fti- pains to prove this, 'which was unneeeffary. He
4e, admitted the fact in the amplest extent. But there
was another position of gentlemen in which he by
''"l no meant agreed, viz. that the foarce of indirett
taxation, would, if refortcd to, be unproductive,
p n . and that it had lince been exhaafted, confe
e. quently, that we mull have recourse to a land tax to
tin procure the necessary supplies. This statement he
entirely dissented from. He was pcrfuaded this
country poffeiTed ample sources of rev.enue, thre'
eflahlifhetJ channels, to raise all the money wanted.
The quettion, then, was one of expediency, whether
this or that mode of raising revenue (hall be adopt
iter- ed I And here lie would observe, that however the ,
The tax was laid, it roust be paid by the people; the
co " pofftffor of the foil and consumer mult pay. The
j^ r whole question was, which way will fee the most
. ],; s convenient to draw the sum wanted from them ?
lord Whether by a circuitous and inditeft mode, or
cm i d y a dircdt and pofitive 1 method ?In comparing
' these different modes 0/ taxation, it would be ne
tof}, ctffaiy to take a view of the difference of circum
itantcs which liiftiiigoifoei ihiscountry from ethurs,
of whose practice in this refpcdl we had foms
knowledge.
He confefled there were great difS.ulties aftend
-1 iÂ«g this fubjoft. He was not a&amcd to c ante fa
himfelfvery uueqoal not only to the ta/k of indica*
ting tÂ» the house what meaftires would be proper
to be taken, but even of judging for himfelf on the
fubjefl. It was a fubjeft which h*d engaged for a
long time tlje heft talents of thiÂ« country, and there
still existed a divifmn of opinion about which waÂ»
the best mode of railing revenue ; but, when an In
dividual waÂ« called tipon to foms a judgment, bowÂ»
eÂ»er difficult the talk m&jr be, he mull take feme
j courfe-or other, and in his choice he could only be
directed by his own understanding, improved and
informed by the experience at others.
Since the fubje& was full of difficulties on all
fides, he said, they had only to chufe between evils.
He was of opinion that whatever objections might
be brought against the fyflem of inditedt taxation,
that the inconveniences of that fyliem weic far left
| than those which would be found in a fyliem of di
rest taxation. With refpeÂ£t to a land tax, or tax
on real property, there were circumstances in whick
he believed it the very belt mode of raifiug revenue
which could be adapted, vis. in a country where
wealth & population were equally diffufed through
out the whole territory ( were markets were, of
course, every where convenient 5 where a farmer
could easily exchange his labour for another man'*
labour, or where produce fold evety where at near
ly the. fame price. In such a country, he believed
a land tax was a very good tax ; there the ratio up
on which such a tax might be equally laid, was rea*
dily attainable ; but, in our country, he said, the
situation of things was totally diiferent.
( It was well known, that the great population and
wealth of this country lay near the sea coafi, and
: that, in proportion as it was reaeded frÂ«m, the pa.
1 pulation became thin and the country comparative
ly poor by being far removed from a market for thÂ«
1 produce of the foil. The exchange against a man
t removed 300 miles from the coast was so great, thÂ«
much oi what he sent to market was waited by the
' expence of conveyance. Hence results, said he,
, the feSrcity of money which exilts in the interior
: of a country like ours, which renders the payment
of a small sum inconvenient, and this difficulty can
" not be removed by any regulation which on be in
t troduced, A man on the Mon .ngaiiela called up*
f on for twenty (hillings, would lind it lie hcavierwp
i on him than a farmer on the Delaware would find
f twenty pounds lie upon him, as he would experiÂ«
ence more than twenty times the difficulty in proÂ«
, curing the money ( for, from the fcarcliy of circu.
lating medium, in remote fituafions, it was almost .
0 imp'oflible to convert the molt valuable articles of
produce into money, wbilft persons living near a,
good market were able to fell the molt triliing
o cles for a good price.
t These observations were so well verified in that
part of the country with which he was belt acÂ»
c quainted, that tlfangh the molt equitable valuation
had taken place, yet a tax which had been laid in
d consequence of that valuation, had been collected
â¢ with the greatclt difficulty.
y It would be found, therefore, from these ftate
u ments (for tiie ttuth of which he appealed to eve
n. ry gerttleman who had thought upon the fubjeft)
n that" let direct taxes be laid in whatever manner
they might, tliey would bear ejttrem.ly hard in
fnme cases, though they mi x ght be perfectly light in
al others. This lie considered as one of thegreateft
" objeitione to a land tax, an objciftion which did not
exist in European countries, as they are full of inr
re habitants, and the farmer had where a mar
ket for his produce.
f n lndireit taxes, on the contrary, Mr. H. said,
were cÂ©lleÂ£ttd with facility, and were voluntarily
paid. If a man found himfelf pinched for money,
3 - he might refrain, from purchaling.'at leali for a
time, of such articles as were taxed, and not ira
lt. mediately necefiaries of life, or he woulel make a
he less quantity serve him ; but a dircft tax could not
,B be avoided, however unable a man might be to pay
it. Hence, he said, would arise executions and a
if- variety of diltrefs amongst that class of citizen*
'f- who wete unable to meet the demands of gewn
'y ment.
ry
Another objeÂ«Sion, not lef* strong, to direA
j' e c taxation, was the impossibility of apportioning such
a tax equally. He said impossibility, ?nd he was
wairanted in the expression. He was desirous ef
"" hearing how the committee of Way* and Mean*
. meant to apportion and colledl this tax ; but thi*
information was withheld, and they were called
upon to agree to the principle without any plan of
carrying it into effefl. He said it was impossible
from two causes; firfl, from marketsbeing remote
ier in foane parts and convenient in others, and confer
ad quently land being of much less value in f.ime part*
en than in others, and from the vast inequality which
â Je took place in proportion to population and to the
â¢re improved or unimproved date of agriculture. SÂ»
by that some parts of the fame di/Mft was of much
id more value than others, and even some farms more
re, than other*, from the superior skill and indultry of
fe- their present pofleflbra, or of those who heretofore
to poffetled them. There, was no part of the country,
he he said, where this remark would not be verified.
!>iÂ« Combine with this circumflance, the contiguity
re' and distance from markets, and the impossibility ef
rd. an equal apportionment would appear evident. Nor
ier was the diffance from a market alone to be confidr
pt- ered ; bad roads were an insurmountable objefiioa
he in some parts of the country. How these difficul
he ties were to be overcome, he was at a loss ta fee,
'he He believed such a tax could not be laid with any
oft degree of justice. It had been aUempt#d in some
n ? slates ; in some it had been found impracticable,
or and 1# otheis attended with very great incoeveni
ing ence. In the (late which he represented, it had
ne- been attempted upon a principle which seemed to
im- be generally approved ; but it had been found that
c/s, a man who pvffefiVd land t>f four tiroes the valuÂ« ofhis neighbour, paifl no Higher'* tw tVan he who- p
poficffcd the pnor lan<l. ,
What, laid Mr. H. must then be done ? Would
you lefort to an aiT.flment ? If so, you embrace an n
immense expeiife. For an assessor to go through p
, thc 'United States, land to class every farm accord- v
irig to its value, would not only be very expense,
but it would require a very long time to accomplish g
such a bafinefs ; and the expense could not be dated
at left tfean from twenty to forty percent, the firft .
year upon the sum raised. And to preserve . iy,
thing like a just valuation, it mali frequently be E
Tepeated, as from emigration, and a variety of a
other caufei, the value of property was continually f
* changing, and thereby the expense would become
very heavy. Besides, from the attachments and
interelts of the persons employed on such an occar-
(ion, there would be no certainty of obtaining a .
just valuation. t
, Viewing ail ri'.efe objections, thersfore, he be- j
lieved it would be allowea', if it was not impeffible, f
it was at lead impracticable to any good effect to '
lay au equal land tax. In other countries, he said, '
" these difficultier, did not exist. The rent of pro- (
perty afforded a certain criterion by which to judge ,
of its value, and there was therefore no difficulty ,
fn forming a just apportionment. 1
These obje&ions, he remarked, couli! not be I
urged againlt iodircft taxation ; but there were
other objeftioHs. They were told that the fotirce '
of indirect taxation was so far exhauded, that to |
encreafe these taxes would risk the int,rodu&ion of '
fmujjgling, by which the. morals of individuals 1
would be destroyed, and the revenue dimiuifhed. 1
These, allowed, if tine, were very serious ob- '
jefliont; but he denied their truth. Ho.* did it
appear that this source had been so much exhausted 1
that no addition could be made without introdu
cing smuggling? TUere was no flatement to prove
this ; bnt he believed he should produce a state
ment which would prove th<; contrary. He be- 1
lieved the duties on several articles were rapidly in
creasing. This proved that duty was paid with
ease and, convenience, and that it might be aug
mented withont danger. But they were lold,
that whilst the revenue depended upon commerce,
it was in the power ef foreign nations greatly to
embarrass it, and utterly to destroy it by a war
with, this country. The propriety was therefore
urged of transferring the tixes from sources which 1
might be so affcÂ£lgd to internal sources.
These objeiflions, Mr. H. said, deserved to be very
seriously weighed. He believed them to He infinitely
the moftfolid which could be urged against this mode
â¢ of taxation ; and if true in their whnle extent, would
afford real ground of objection. But, in the firft
place, it miy.be remarked, we are already in this pre
dicament. as ojjr refeurces depend upon duties arifrng
from foreign articles imported ; and we should be fto
morefo, by increaling those duties, since we were as
Â«ffe<ftually under frhat influence whilst five millions were
drawn from thit source, as if double the sum was
drawn from it. He would ask, if the danger was in
creased by increasing the duty ? He believed not; but
that the benefits would be increased, without increasing
the danger or evil.
He believed, however, that this objection was so so
lid as to command attention, and to require us to fbape
our course accordingly. He believed it was advisable
for them to turn their eyes from foreign tÂ» domestic
sources of revenue, and commence a system, which
may be increased as neceflity may require, and upon
which may be transferred a part at least 6f that duty
which is at present drawn from foreign sources. This,
he thought, was found policy, and this would be found
to be his intention;
There was another point of view, in which lie plan
lie should propose recommended itfelf. all knew
money was Immediately wanted. They were not to
project a revenue which would be wanted by and by ;
1,t00,000 dollars were wanted immediately. This
sum, he said, might immediately be drawn from esta
blished channels ; but how long a time, he asked, would
it take to raise it by a direÂ£l tax ? ThofÂ« who were belt
acquainted with the fubjerft, would be able to fay there'
was always great uncertainty in new sources of reve
nue, particularly when the objedt of taxation was en
tirely untried. Circumstances might hereafter juftify
a transfer of a part of this tax, but, at present, the
system of taxes already organized, should be relorted
to, as in that there could be no deception ; they would
only have to ask for the money and ft would be there.
He believed it would be to extend any
farther his general observations on the introduSion of
this fubje<?t x he should now fubir.it to the committee a
sketch oi objefis, which he meant to propose in place
of a direct tax on land. He did not mean this as a
Complete system ; some of the articles might pe-haps
be properly enough struck out, and others introduced.
He intended more to recommend the plan than any
particular object. He would, however, point out the
sources which had struck him as proper tolie resorted
to, and leave the committee to determine upon the
propriety of adoptiiig or rejecting them.
Salt at present paid u cents pe; bushel, ard theckar
inereafe of duty from 179J to 1795* had been from
*47>000 to 345, cop dollars. This inereafe, he said,
proved that the present duty was no way burderiforrte,
as the ccnfumption had greatly increased. He there
fore proposed an addition of 12 cents pirbufhel, which
â would make an inereafe of duty at least 300,000 dollars.
â If it was thought this was too great an inereafe, a less
might be adopted. It might be said this was taxing
a necefTary of life ; bat, he said, if fait were taxqdi !
he could use what he pleased of it; but the fame re
jr.* k wmld not hold g<;od with refp*<ft t 0 a tax on
land. Three bushels of lalt would serve a laboring
man, his'wife and three or four children a year, or
admitting it; to be four bushels, this additional duty
would only amount to half a dollar, and what portion
of a land tax would fall lighter than this! It would
be said fait was used for cattle alio. The quantity used
for this purpose, he believed, was final!. A bushel of
fait would be enough for 30 cattle in a year, but if \it
â were twq bushels, the additional duty would only be
a quarter sf a dollar, which would not be felt by a
mar. who kept this number of cattle ; and if his num
ber Â«as larger, and he were a dealer, those to whom'
be fold them weuld pay the duty. The fame jekferva
tion wquld hold good with refpeil to fait used in fall
ing up provisions for file.
His next'objea was an augmentation of the tax on
foreign merchandize which at preient paid percent,
ad valorem. This duty, he said, had increased from
T793 to '95 from 4iJ,000 to 1,781,000 dollars. There
had, indeed, beer, a small inereafe of duty between
**9j and '794, w hie I. operated 111 1794, bat the in
ci'eafe of duty had nfct been by any means equal to thiÂ«
n.creafed produce ; and this being the cafe, it
hi concluded the duty ha* been paid with convenience
and that it would bear an augmentation, and more pari
ticu'.-rlv if It was recollefled that the articles included
Â»n this clals, wtrc raeftly articles of luxury and ex
pence fair rtbjetfs of fine* Â«
ihe tax won la fall fpuu the rich cpffwf*. P^ a Pfj
he said, there aiight be inme articles ot riectULy
the lift, whfch might bedeiudted, without making a
material iiflÂ«ence in his calculation, lie would pio- j
pose to augment this class of articles to ij per cent.
which would produce 300,000 dollars.
He would propose alf<> to augment that clats 0.
goods which at present paid per cent, ad valorem.
The duty on these from 1773 to 1795 had increaled c
from Â«3,0c0 to 645,000 dollars. This duty having t
increased five-fold (allowing for a small increak ot a
dutv as in the former cafe) it might very well be aug
mented, especially as the articles in this chfs were
alf) articles of expellee and luxury. Suppoic 2 i-i
per cent, added to this ; clifi, it would produce ieo.soe
dollars. ,
His next objefl was that class of foreign merchan
dize which at present paid 15 per cent- The net re
venue of this class in 1793 was 81,000, m 1794,
36a,800, in X79J, 885,00 c dollars. Thucla f s of ar
ticles, he said, was exctedingFi numtrous, Â«ind corn
prifed many articles of geuei al confumptisn by all clal- 1
fes of the community, but also some of expcnce. rei- <
haps it would not be advisable to increale the duty very
much on this particularly as many of (
were such as were manufactured in this country, and (
to increase the duty too much, might enrour a mo- j
nopuly amongst our manufacturers at home, wjiich he i
w r ould wilh to avoid.âHe (hould think, however, 25
per cent, upon the present amount might very well be 1
laid, which would produce ioc,ooo dollars. (
Madeira Wine was an article, the duty upon ,
which might be increased, though it was already 1
pretty high. In 1793 this duty had produced 1 17, 1
000 dollars, 1794, 152,000, in 1785, 190,000 (
dollars. The consumption it appeared had increaf- 1
ed very confiderablv and he thought it would at 1
least bear 10 per ctnr. upon the present duty, which 1
would produce 15,000 dollars. He believed this
might be done ; but if it (hould be doubtful, it
might be dropped without inconvenience.
Sherry, Lisbon, and certain oii er unenumerated
wind, the duties upon which he oelieved liaol in
creased mere thaÂ» upon Madeira, he proposed an
augmentation which (hould be equal to 15,000 dol
lais.
Foreign Spirits not distilled from grain, was a
msiigft the objects on which an augmentation might
take place. This article produced in 1793, 898,
COO dollars in 1794, 1,492,000, in 1795, 1,400,
000. The drawback in 1795 had been greater
tha* the preceeding year. He would augment this
duty to per ceut. on present amount, which would
produce 100,eoo dollars.
Bohea Tea was an article of great consumption,
which at present paid io cents per lb. In 1793
this uriicle had produced 163,000 dollars, in 1794,
226,000, and in 1795, 222,000. He said he
was not so certain with refpeft to the pni*irietyof
increasing the duty upon thife article as upon ethers.
The fmallnefs of its bulk made it a convenient arti
cle for fmugglisg, and it would not therefore, be
prudent to advance the duty toj high upon it. He
thought, however, 10 per cent might be added to
it, which would produce 20,000 dollars.
Brown Sugar, he said now paid if cent per Ib.
It had poduced in 1793, 646,000 dollars, in 1794
510,000, in 1795, 7o 1 7,000 dollars. This duty
of t 1-2 cent having been found a very light duly,
being more so than the duty upon moil other for
eign articles, he propose to augment it one cent
per lb. which would produce 4Â®Â®,ooÂ® dollars.
These augmentatioasjadded together, he said,
would amount to 1,450,000 dollars.
This sum, he believed, might be very well raif- I
ed by additional imposts, which was a greater :
sum than was wanted ; 1,200,000 dollars being 1
' the ettimaied sum required. The augmentations j
( which he had proposed might therefore be greatly ;
. reduced. This additionaly revenue, he said,"- would
i be raised without as increase of expence of one cent
in the pound, by a fylletn ef collection already ef
' tablifhed, and understood, and might be produced
' without delay. '
] He proposed also that 100,000 dollars ftieuld
. be raised by a tax on (tamps, and 150, or 200,000
, by a tax on windows.
He propefed these ? he said, not so much with a
I view of immediate revenue, bur as a means ps tranf
-1 ferring by degrees the revenue from foreign to do
mestic sources. He had no doubt that a tax on
' (tamps might be made to produce 500,00o v dollaiÃj
and a tax on windows 4,000,000 if wanted. This
' might also be done with great facility, ant) would
t be infinitely preferable to a land tax, as it would
j fall equally upon all parts of [he Union. He was
. not lure jjut a lax upon hearths might not be (till
r better; and by these meafu res they would fee how
j far they could go in drawing revenue from internal
instead Â»f foreign fosrees.
This, he said, mn(t be gradual. The firft thing
aeceffary was to organize a tax, which might take
, several years to bring to perfeftien. In the mean
time, they (hould get what was immediately wanted
) from the sources he bad already pointed out 5 and
- in cafe of future wants, they could have recourse
h to the (tamp and window or hearth tax.
s r Â° ar P cr Concluded with faying, he was feufi
ble the Dianhehad proposed an imperfect one;
Â» but as gentlemen had been cautioned agaitift object
ing to the fyfiem of direst taxation, except they
n produced a fubltitute, he had piodueed this, which
g might be added to or dimiuilhed from, as the cÂ«m
>r mittee (hutild fee proper. He was convinced of the
) neceffily of iurther -evenue, and he believed that
a the paiiiatifm of the people <>f this count,y would

COMMUNICATIONS. ,
The French party seem very sure that an envoy
extraordinary will be sent to Franceâbecause they
infill that the very fame (hould now be met
ed out to France that W33 raetcd to Btitain it),
1794. If they think thus, is it not strange that
they do not propose an embargo ? Does their own i
conduct make' no precedent for ancfther call exact
ly similar, putting France instead of England ? i
Why are they filer.t about sequestration of French ,
debts and propetty : Why do they not prohibit all i
commercial intercourse vith France and her coio- |
nles ? Yet these are the men who boall of a majo
rity in one house of Congress, and neve i belefs have (
charged the friends of order with paitiality and in- i
confirtency, as if a minority were answerable for |
what they cannot dÂ», and as if they thought the ,
task easier to make the charge again ft others than ,
to answer it themselves. Fasts are ftubboru things.
Colonel Pickering is attacked by a drowfyfeep
tic, yclep'd " a citizen*' on the score of ignorance,
because he was not so learned in the treachery of
courts, as to di Jbeiieve every thing that the Minis

A Secretary of State here is to aft the part of a
member of a Democratic Societyâto believe every
thing untrue that any government asserts) and to
aft upon any thing foatier thau the evidence of
faftsand the best authentic documents. The ,tio
ral spirit of this country ib net debased enough to
fanftiau this fort of political decyphering. When
eÂ»er it becomes rteceffary, however, in felf defence,
good mailer citizer. has told us in what diplomatic
corps we may find a mailer key to the cyphers.
It has been been frequently and justly remarked
that a habit of falfehood realiy bewilders some per
sons. When once accustomed to represent things
as they are not, they lose the nice and ready dil
cernment of the impreflion that facts make upon
those who ate nfed to feeing and reprefeuting them
at they art. The chatafter of public men is a fact
of this fortâit is in reality the impreffioti that the
public has taken refpefting such men. When we 4
speak of a Congress man's or Secretary's charac
ter, we do not confine it to one man's pi irate
judgment, .npreven to that which would'geneially
prevail, if the foibles and weaknefles of the char-,
attcr in qtieftion were trumpeted abroad. The ac
tual impreflion on the public decides what is called,
character, a word which imports that we speak of
what is, not what might be.
TheTe observation lead one to remark on the
great blindntfs of the diforganizersas to facts.
| Their little junto has so longbrpoded over the tales
! thai are hatched in their midnight meetings, that
| they lwfe all knowledge of the judgment that the
impartial and refpeftable public has definitively
! pafled upon the characters thev have slandered.
The Prefiderit and the heids of the Depaitments
are mentioned in the Jacobin Gazettes, as having
funk very low in the estimation of thc'Citizensâ
and thi3 they lately tell the very public which at the
moment is solicitous to evince it a unbounded ref
[ pest for tha President, and which is alfa reading the
, 1 able, perspicuous and masterly report of one Secre
t tary 011 the Land Tax, and the excellent and irre
, fragable diplomatic letter of another.
The Jacobins mistake their own opinions for that
of the public, and they become once more as they
, have been invariably heretofore the dupes of their
own credulity and malice.
| The anarchists arc sue that an extra envoy will be
I fcle<sted for a Trench million froai the iDemocratic
corps. It might indeed please Fiance to fee such an
' ; one, becaafe Charles de la Croix would answer our end
1 no worle and that of France nc better' rhan a true De
mocrat. Ihe man who would have fubjesed Mr. Jay
I in 1781 to the Count de Vergennes has given proof of
his gallicism and might polfefs and deserve the confi
. denee of every body, but his oÂ»n countrymen. Yet

Yesterday arrived here, in a felp from Marseilles, | t
Monf. de Montpenfier and Monf. de Beaujolois, bro- â
thers of Monl d'Orleans. u _ b
They have left Frauce with a passport from the Ex

COMMUNICATION. a
The expreflion that Archduke Charles would prove J
the bed segociator for this country was e
nough never used by tile gentleman to whom it is a
scribed by a Jacobiu gazette. However that may be,
it isaJmelt as easy to'vindicate as to misrepresent it.
In the ftrll place the Archduke Charles would not r
leave the terms entirely to the i-reucluhemi'elves, which
the more than half Frenchman whom the party would n
employ directed Mr. Jay to do in 782. t
But the question really is this, Do the fuccefles of
the Auftrians tend to the good or evil of this country
as it l'efpedls France? the uncontrouled power of
France has excited her to abuse the rights of the Ita
lian and other dates. Tfie fame caul'e has led her to 1
attempt to cut off the trade of England with this coun- 1
try. This is the true motive of all her conduit, as t
the declarations of the French thenafelves have clearly t
proved. Now do oujr-patriots chul'e to avow their mi- f
abated wifees that France may so on conquering and
fSTÃmjOTitrll the trade and independence ot-Amenca
are as low at her feet as thatÂ«f Tufcany and Sardinia !,. 1
With less power fee will no doubt effeit mere mode- t
ration and treat neutrals better in proportion as fee c
comes down again from the imaginary throne of unit
verfal dominion te that level winch will oblige her to
r'efped the rights and fulfil the duties prescribed by the
laws of nations. Not wifeing to fee my native cotln
try, plundered and oppressed as it is, I wife success to
those who are fighting our defpoilers androbber's. May
France keep her independence and gain finally that li
berty winch fee ha 3 so much abused and outraged ; but
may her power never be so augmented as to put our
rights and sovereignty at her mercy. ,

THE WARNING No. 11.
INDEPENDENT of the commands of hnnor, 1
the cooled calculations of intered forbid our becu- 1
ming the inltruments of the ambition of Fiance, !
by associating with her in the war. The question '
is no longer the establishment of liberty on 1 lie ba /'
iisof republican government. This point the en -
mies of France have ceased to dispute. The ques
tion now is whether (he (hall be augraudixed by mew
qui fit iocs, and her enemies reduced by dilmem 1
tie iâ a raÂ»v render her,the
jnillrefs of Europe, and confuquently in a great
measure of America. This is tru y the lemaiuing
fubjeft of contention. '
They who understood the real strength and re
sources of France before the prelent war, knew
that (lie was iturinfically the moil powerful nation
of Europe. The incidents of the war' have dis
played this faÂ£t in a manner which is the a(WÂ»ifh
ment of ,the W'rld. If France tan finally realize
â¢ "Her present plan of aggrandizement, she will attain
to a degree of greatness and power, which if not
counteracted by internal disorder, will tend to make
her the terror and the scourge of nations. The
fgirit of moderation in a date of overbearing pow
er is a phenomenon, which has not yet appeared,
x and which 110 wile man w ill expect evet to fee. It >
is ceitain that a very different fpitit has hilhorte
marked the career of the new republic ; and it is
tiue .0 truth to add, that the arden', impetuous,
and military genius of the French, affords perhaps
less profpeft of such a spirit in them than in any
'other people.
'Twere therefore tontrary to our true intercft to
aflift in building up this colossus to the enoimous
iize at vyhich (he aims. ,'Twere policy as (hort '
fiflH'-f * ff "*'" f '****J a fubfervit 1 icy to
her views as the price of her clemency. This at
bell would be but a temporary lefpite iroiri the rod ;
it indeed that can be called a rtfpite, which is of
, itfelf the lacrifice of a real to a nominal indepen
dence.
These reflections are not designed to rouse a spi
rit of hostility against France, or to inculcate the
idea tlt#t we ong)>Â» of choice to participate in the ;
war agaifift her. They are intended merely to for
tify the motives of honor, which forbid our (loop
ing to be ccmpclledj either to submit without resis
tance to a viuual war on her pari, or'to avert her
blows by engaging in the yvav on her fide.
When it was the opinion, 'hat France was defend
ing the caute of Liberty, it was a decisive argu-.
mcnt againlt embaikirig with her in the contest,
that it would expose Us to hazards and evils infinite
ly difproportioned to the afiiltance we could render.
Now that the question plainly is, whether France
/hall give the law to mankind, the addition of our
opposition to her plan could have too little influ
ence upon the event tojufti'y our willingly encoun
tering the certain dangers and mifchiefs of the en
terprise. 'Tis our true policy to remain at peace,
. if we can, to negotiate our fubjeds of complaint as
long at they (hall beat all negotiable, to defer a
refortjo arms 'till a lad effort of negotiation fliall <
have demonstrated that there is no alternative, but i
the surrender of our sovereignty or the defence of 1
itâthat the only option is between infamy or war. '
But if unhappily this period (hall ever arrive, it I
will impose a (acred and indispensable dutyâto
wieet the contest with firwnefs, and relying on a I
just providence, confidently to commit the iflue to c
the God of Battles.
While it is a cenfolation to know, that oar go
vernment, on this as on other trying eccafions, will
aft with perfefit prudence, and will do every thing f
that hoi,or pnmitj to prefenrc peace; Yet it is uot i
Â«
tn he forgotten that there is a point st which for- . â
bearai ce must flapâbeyond which moderation ! T
were bafet-efsâwhere we must halt and nuke a
stand for our rights or cease to pretend ta any. wi
When the'indifcriminate seizure of our veffeta
by British cruisers under the order of tbe sixth of sri
Novrmber 1793, had bfought otir affairs with B
Great Britain tu a crisis, which led to the measure th
of fend i ig a special etiv<Â»y to that country to ob- â¢
tain relief and reparation, it was well understood N
that the iffuc of that miftUn was to determine the ea
question of peace or war between the two uations.
In like manner, it is to be expected that our execu- fe
tive will make a solemn and final appeal to the justice
arid filtered of France, will infilt in mild but ex- hÂ«
piicit terms on tbe renunciation of the pretension
to intercept the lawful cojnuierce of neutrals with li
the enemies of France and the inilitution of some ca
equitable mode of ascertaining and retributing the u
lodes which the exercUe of it his inflicted Â«pon our ai
merchants. If the experiment (hall fail, there will ai
be nothing left but to repel aggression and defend t|
our commeree and irrdependenee. The refoluti <n *
to do 1 his will then be imposed Â»Â« ihe government ci
by a painful but irrcfiftible neceflity, and it were F
an outrage 'o 'the American name and character to c:
doubt that the people of the United States will ap- pi
prove the refolutioH, and will support it wilh a con- w
ftancy worthy of the jtidice of their cause, and of ei
the glory they have heretofore delerved and acqui
red. I"
No: let this never be doubted! The servile (1
I minions of Franceâthole who have no fenfibihty in
to injury but whea it comes from Great Britain, h
who are unconscious of any rights to be protedted vi
itgainft. Franee, who, at a moment when the pub- ,(1;
lie Ufety more than ever demands a drift union be- ai
tween she people and their government, traiteroully
labour to detach them from it, and to turn againlt 2
the government foi pretended faults, theA-fentmeiit
which the real opf.rcffu.ns of France ought 10 in- t(
spireâthese wretched men wilt difccvcr in the end, b
" that they arenas irtfignificant as they are unprinci fa
pledâ'l ney will fina that they have vainly flattered w
themselves with the co-operation of th# great body it
of tho(e men with whom the spirit of party has
hitherto associated themâln such an extremity the F
adventitious difcrimii.ations of party will be 101 lin fa
the patriotism and pride of the American charac- F
ter. Good citizens of every political deaomiiia- h
tion will rcmembtr that they are AmeiicansâthÂ»f d
when their country is in danger, the merit 01 de ir
merit of particulnv measures is no longer a question
âthat it is tbe dmy ot alt to uni e then efforts to J
guard the national rights, lo avert na'ional hub
miliation, and to withltand the imposition of a si
yoke. The true and genuine spirit of 17761 9
not the vile counterfeits of it which foofteudifguii j>
our eyes and our eirs, will warm every truly A me- v.
rii an heart, and light up in it a noble emulation to n
maintain inviolate the rights, and uniuilied the ho- u
J nor of ihe American nation. It will be proved, to
the confuQon of all falfe patriots, that we did not C
break the fetters of one foreign tyranny to put an f;
those of another. It will be piove'.l to ihe
world that we uoderftand our lights and have the V
coiwage to defend them. li
But there is tiill ground tohtve that we IhalNiot 1
t>c~n.ivcii 10 liiis clifagrrcrrtric-extttmity. l'hemoie f
r deliberate calculations ot Fiance will probably tef f
' cue us from the prefer.t embarrafsiiient. I. (Jio.per- u
feveres in her plan, Ihe mult inevitably at'd all. the -
neutral powers to the numbei of herenemies. How
( will this fulfil the purpose of destroying the com- y
- merce of Great Britain ? The commerce Â«f those 1;
powers with Fiance will then intireiy cease, and be
turned more extenflvely into the channels of Great 5
Biitaiu, protedtcd by her navy, with the co-opcra- i
t tio'o of the maritime fofce of those powers. The r
e relult will be the reveift?of what is projc&ed by -
c the mcrfute. The comrri;rce and revenue of 'Bri- r
tain will in all likelihood be augmented rather than (
I dirainifhed ; and her arms will receive an important ci
reinforcement.
u Violent and unjust measures commonly defeat v
s theii own purpose. The plan of Starving France '
was of this delciiptiun and opuattd againd the ~
views of its projedtors. The plan nuw'adoptcd by
France of cutting u.ff the trade of neutrals with her j
etilmies, alike violent and /Ur'jtiH, will 110 doubt I I
) end in limilar difappÂ»intment. Let us hope that i\
it will be abandoned, and that ultimate rupture
j will be avoidedâbut let lis also contemplate the
! pt>flÂ»bility of the contrary and prepare our minds r
seriously for the unwelcome event.

Dear Sir,
/ I should have written you last week, had I then been
able to ascertain ccrtain fads, the rumour of which I had
heard. A Mrs. Beers, a near n'eighbour to me, the wife
of Lben Beers, and daughter of capt:.in Samuel Hoggins,
of this town, had been, ior tourteea veeks, exceedingly
dillfelTed with the Rhcumatiim, to lut.h a degree that for
fourteen week* pr viotn to the 19th of lu'l month, she
had net been able *. walk across tile room even with crut
ches. lave only once, when file made out with thu a (lift.
ance of crutches to hobble part of the way aero s her loom.
Ou the 2vtli o! September tail, she procured a set of your
metallic fubftanccs, acdin less than an hour after ihe had
begun to ufc them, in the manner dir. vHcd by ) ou, she
roft from her chair, and walked about her house, and on
the next day she went abroad to her neighSourc, having
thrown afidc her ct utches. I have this d..y paid htr a vi.il
in company with her father, and Timothy Jones, Elq.
who lives in the flreet where fee rcfties and direflly or>-
posit- to her residence, and with Capt. Abel Btlrrett, Vrho
ia her nex* neighbor, and lives, within eight yards of her

It is a duty which yen owe yourfclf and the world to pro
