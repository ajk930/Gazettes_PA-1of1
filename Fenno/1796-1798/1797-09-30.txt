* i Bache's- opinion ofthe present Despots of France.
From the Aurora of May 18, 179 J.
It will give an idea of the party* which
â¢ now prevails in Paris, to mention, (and that
can be done on the authority of the Paris
" prints) that those citizens who chufe t<s dress
in a plain manner aijd without powder, are
insulted in the ftrects by the Mejfieurs, who
fide with Tallien and Freron. The leaders
of the faftion now uppermost in the Conven
tion*, are remarkable only for thefc pecula
tions and profligacy ; their reign will there
fore not be long. But while contending
faftions, impelled by private motives, thus
ft disgrace the hall of the Convention, by their
scandalous proceedings, the real pilots of
j the state digrft in secret retirement the plans
which, independent of the conduft of in
triguers and political gladiators, will con
duit the Teflel of state to the harbours of
peace and political happiness.
? 1 Every person who has followed the course
of European politics, thro' the French re
e volution, will reoollea the name of the ab
bejSieyes, and fo'mething of his political
sentiments. It will be remembered, that,
against the opinions of Thomas Paine, he
maintained, that an extensive territory could
I be governed bnt by a monarch. This man,
Robespierre saved (with many others) to
make a tool of his talents, but never trusted
hint further than in digesting the details of
i plans of which the outlines and principles
were firft laid down.âThis man, the present
,* ruling party have places in the Committee of
â  Public Safety, a situation of primary import
ance. This faft is a ufeful commentaty on
the views and principles of that party.
; | The known enmity between Tallien and
. his party, and Barrere, Billaud and their ad
herents. has induced us to give more im
plicit belief to the account of the execution
! â¢ of the latter, than, upon refle&ion, it de
serves, &c. See.
' ** The authors of tht now existing state of
things in France, and from amongst wham the

by inferring in his ufeful paper the within

Five Shillings for every offence by Cursing, ,

A.good thing can never come amiss, tho' '
it be late ; and it is pleasing to fee the pus- 1
sing, truth-telling, honest orator of New
â  York, called up once more to merited con
tempt. In his long, fulfome, frothy ha
rangue upon the answer to the Prelident's
Speech, the ." faftidious" citizen spoke of 1
his penetration at about seven years of age ! '
in forefeeing the consequences of the French j
union to America. A very forward and ,
promising child ! Nature, as if tickled with
so bright an inflance, seems to have prolong- J
ed his childhood to this time.
From the ALBANr CENT IN EL. <
Mr. Andrews, v
By recording in the Centinel the following c
instances of democratic veracity, you will c
gratify A CUSTOMER. I [
In the debate 011 the reported address to \
the President, during the last feflion of Con- c
grefs, Citizen Edward Livingston, a- a
mong other filly things said, "Oh ! let me e
not pass unnoticed that joy -which Iso -well t
remember to have beamed on every counte- t
nance, upon the inspiring tidings that F, ance 0
had joined her arms to ours, in defence of our J
libertiesâ No, it njver can be erased from my 0
heart : in the gloomy horrors of desolation n
and an affaflinating wer, I could read by the a
light of those flames which consumed my pater- f,
nal mansion, by thejoy that Jparkled in every 0
eye, how great were the consequences of her x
union to Americaâl feel the revival of that r |
animating joy kindle this moment in my bo- tl
fomâl will ever cherish it in my heart." f ;
Reader, pause a moment, and then judge of t ]
the veracity of ri/Â»zÂ«iLivingfton'sftatement. tl
His paternal mansion was consumed in the h
autumn of 1777â Yet he tells us that he so
well remembered to have read, by the light of
ibt flames which consumed it, a treaty not
made till about four months after, at Paris. a .
To crown all, at the moment he delivered 1}
his speech, "he felt the revival of that ani- Â«
mating joy kindle in his bosom." It is a Â«Â«
pity the young orator had npt said that he Â«Â«
anticipated all this animating joy j xij-, that fp
â t exiited in his mind's eye,
Those who talk of bluftAng for a man whose
talents, veracity, real love of country,
have never been questioned except by a fafti
Â«Â«* gaug of pretended patriots,'who, in the
pursuit of promoting themselves to office,
have vilified those eminent characters vvl/ofe
virtues and talents have procured to them
; n the. confidence of the people, should think
ln of blushing for themselves.

P" Brookes gives the following account of an ex

in Â« Their monarchy is eleftive. On the
death of the sovereign, the privilege of

s Â» without regard to primogeniture, is con
ferred on three of the most diftinguilhed
w men, whose age, and charaftor for wisdom,
Â»- are denoted by their title of elders. These
s - retire to a sequestered place, the avenues to
in which are carefully guarded ; and, while
their deliberations last, the princes are
as closely confined in separata chambers of the
lm palace. Their choice being made, they
proceed to the apartment "of the foverrign
. eleft, and condiift him, in filente, to the
>Â» gloomy place, \Vhere the unburied corpse
*â¢ of his father, that cannot be irtterred till
the conclusion of this awful ceremony,
'â¢ awaits his arrival. There the elders expav
tiate to him on the virtues and defefts of
his deceased parent; describing, with pa
negyric or censure, the meaiures that ex
Â»â¢ alted or funk the glory of his reign. " Yotf

t EXTRAORDINARY ENTERPRI7.E.
s Cadwalader Colden, in his hijlory of the
s Five Nations, gives the following remark
e able tnjlance, of savage courage and perfe
-3 verance in pursuit of revenge.
s An Indian, named Pifkaret, one of the
- captains of greatest fame among the Adi
rondacks, with four other captains, set out
for Trois-Rivieres in one canoe, each of
> them being provided with three mufquets,
3 which they loaded with two bullets apiece,
r joined with a small chain ten inches long ;
f they met with five canoes in Sorel River,
5 each having ten men of the Five Nations
on board. Pifkaret and his captains, as
â  soon as those of the - Five Nations drew
! near, pretended tor give themselves up fori
loft, and sung their death song , then fud- j
; denly fired upon the canoes, which they re
peated with the arms that lay ready lpaded,
â  and tore those birch vessels betwixt wind
and water. The men of the Five Nations
i were so surprised, that they tumbled out
â¢ of their canoes, and gave Pifkaret and his
companions the opportunity of knocking*
i as many of them on the head as they pleaf
-1 ed, and saving the others to feed their re
| venge, which they did, by burning them
alive with the most cruel torments. This,
however, was so far from glutting Pifkaret's
revenge, that it seemed rather to give a
keener edge to it; for he soon after under
took another enterprize, in which none of
his countrymen durst accompany him : he
was well acquainted with the country of
the Five Nations, and set out about the i
time the snow began to melt, with the
precaution of putting the hinder part of
his snow shoes forward, that if any should
happen upon his footfteps, they might i
think he was gone the contrary way ; and,
for further security, weot, along- the ridges
and high grounds, where the snow was 1
melted, that bis track might be often loft ; i
when he came near one of the villages of i
the Five Nations, he hid himfelf till nijrht, i
and then entered a cabin, while every body I
was faft asleep. murdered the whole family, i
<jnd carried their scalps into his lurking l
place. The next day the people of the <
village searched for the mtirderer in vain. (
The following night he murdered all he i
found in another cabin. The inhabitants <
next day searched likewise in vain for the ]
murderer ; but the third night a watch was i
kept in every house. Pifkaret in the night c
bundled up the scalps he had taken the two t
former nights, to carry as the proof of his I
viftory, and then stole privately from house t
to house, till at last he found an Indian nod- c
ding, who was upon the watch in one of r
the houses ;he knocked this man the r
head ; but as this alarmed the reft, he was 1
forced immediately to fly. He was, how- 1
ever, under no great concern from the pur- t
suit, being more fwift of foot than any f
Indian then living. He let his pursuers [
come near him from time to time, and then r
would dart from them. This he did with i
design to tire them out with the hopes of c
overtaking him. As it began to grow dark, r
,he hid himfelf, and his pursuers flopped to c
reft- They not being apprehensive of any e
danger from a single man, soon fell asleep, fl
and the bold Pifkaret observing this, knock- a
ed them all on the head, and carried away p
their scalps with the reft. Such stories as v
these are told among the Indians, as extra- r
ordinary instances of the courage an 3 con- 1
dust of ther captains. The Indians will r
often travel thus three or four hundred p
miles singly, or two or three in company, g
and lurk about their enemy's borders for ;
several weeks, in hopes to revenge the death c
of a near relation or dear friend. Indeed t
they give themselves so very much up to f<
revenge, that this pafilon seems to gnaw I<
their fouls, and give* them no reft till, they ri
fatisfy it. It is this delight in revenges fl
that makes all barbarous nations cruel; and f;
the curbing filch pailions is. one of the e.
happy effefts of being civilized- h

REMARKS.
Such are some of the blefled <jfFefts of the
total difofganization of civil society, or what
is called a revolution ; by which the industri
ous mechanic and the refpedable farmer are
mod commonly ruined, and the idle, the a
bandoned and profligate, who are always stir
ring up mifchief and trouble, enriched by
the disorder they have created. I view fre
quent revolutions as pregnant with so many
evils and crimes, that those who dire&ly or
indireftly foment them ought to be branded
as the greatest enemies of human happiness..
How often have a few desperate villains,
under the plaulible, specious pretext of ne
cessary moderate reformation, introduced
the moll horrid anarehy, butchery and rob
beryâoverturning the mod sacred institu
tions fetting father against child, and
child against fatherâpromoting feuds a
mong frienus, and'dcadly anrirtofities amono*
neighbours > That the revolution in France
has not tended to the good of the people at
large, is glaring to every perfijn who knows
the general misery which prevails in that un
fortunate country. The great body of the
people have only changed mailersâhave, in
i eturn foi their former landlords, who were
in general, polite, refined and humane, re
ceived as mailer's a banditti of idle, lawless
ruffians, at once brutal, unpoliihed, and un
civilized. Ihe great estates formerly own
ed by men whom a principle of honor re- '
drained within the bounds of moderation
and benevolence, are now owned by the des
perate unprincipled villains who have per
verted the objed of the revolution, and car*.
ried it to such an unheard of extreme.
Property is gone out of the hands of honed
men, into that of scoundrels ; and the poor
of France, w|lo hardly own a An
gle acre of the foil they cultivate, have by
the glorir.us revolution, only be ome demo,
cratic instead of feudal vaiTals. They have
this additional mortification', that their pre
iep.t brutal, unpolifljeJ and *nprincipled
lords are deftitutt of that mild douceur, that
refinement of manners, which makes even
slavery itfelf supportable. It is a notorious
fad, that the greater part of those immense
estates which were ccnfifcattd in France,
have'througli iniquitous laws, got into the
hands of the most furious of the revolution
ids, who have paid little or nothing for
them, by means of a paper-currency depre
ciated to almost nothing. lam convinced
thattlie war owes long continuance to
the rears of the n...rs of France and their
partisans, of being dripped of their iic
menfe and i!l-gottcÂ» polTeilions, which they
are fe Ã fible will be taken from them on the
â¢vyitofa general peace, and whith they; ilerermtned to enjoy as loijg as they can.
* They know that a fwte of tranquillity wquld

to overawe and prevent a free eledtion of re

ries the people have fnftaiaed by men ailing
iiithename'of libertyâthey feel justly ap
prehthfive of national resentmentâWhen
peace takes pk<s,e let them trouble ! Yes,
I hope, and am certain, that when the feel
ings of the French people are reprefenyd by
an unbiassed ele&Ioo, to which as yet they 1
are flrangers, that national vengeance will
hitvlthe present bloody usurpers from their
feats of power, and drip them agd their par
tisans of HI their revolutionary plunderâ
What good man but raufl wish, with anxious
solicitude, the speedy confummution of so
j aft, so fortunate an event ? But while we
indulge the sacred hope of feeing the revo
lutionary robbers stripped of their immense
possessions, we should suppress the wish of
feeing the former great land-holders reinstat
ed in the whole of the property they for
merly owned :âwe ought to confine our
hopes of restitution to those only, who pos
sessors of a moderate property and friends to
regulated liberty, were driven from their
country by the tyrants of the revolution,
who, had they remained in France, woul<f
have loft their lives. What a flab will
the hellish views of revolutionifli throughout
the world receive, from the changes wh jch.
peace tvill bring about in France ?âWfiat
a mortification to fee the apoflles of hbirty
and equality lose all their revolutionary spoils;
to fee all their overgrown, ill-gotten proper
ty torn from them ? What a dreadful ex
ample will it not afford to
out the universe, and particularly, those of
America I What a death flroke to the hopes
of our anarchills and diforganizers,' to fee

NEW-YORK, September 30.
On Wednesday the 20th iiift. came on to
trial, before the hon. Judge Cufhingy in the
Circuit Court of thp United States for the
â¢ diljriil of Coine&icut, the cause of Samuel
Fowler, and others, against Maiy Lyndfay
and others, in which the Plaintiffs claim, un
der a grant from the state of Connefricut,
a part of the traft of land called Connecti
cut Gore. The defendants holding under a
title derived from the state of New-York,
appeared and pleaded to the jurifdiftion of
the Court, that the landderaanded was with*
in the diftrift of New-York, and not with
in the diflriÂ£t of Connecticut, on which an
t issue was joined, and a jury summoned to try
the issue.
The defendants then challenged the array
of the jurors, and for causes of challenge al
ledged, I. That the pannel was arrayed by
the Marshal of the diflrift of Connedlicut,
who was a, freeman and inhabitant of said
state. 2. That the deputy Marshal by
whom the Marshal summoned and arrayed
the jurors wa3 interefled as a purchaser and
claimant ih said Gore. To which challenge
the plaintiffs demurred, and the defendants
joined in demurrer.
The question was very ably and learnedly
argued by Mess. Parsons and Sullivan on
die part of the Plaintiffs ; and by MefTrs.
Hoffman and Hamilton on the part of the
defendants. After the arguments the court
gave tlveir opinion that the firfl cause of chal
lenge allcdged was inefficient, but that the
second reason assigned was fufficient, and on
that ground quashed the array. -
A m6tion was then made by the Plain
tiffs to have another jury immediately sum
moned ; but the term being so nearly expi
red,- as not to leave fufficient time for the
trial of the cause, thecourt overruled the mo
tion ; and the cause of course was continued
to the next term to be holden at New-Ha
ven in April next.
BOSTON, September 26.
This day general Hull's division of mi
litia will be reviewed at Concord. It is
supposed there will be about 7000 men un- I
der arms, including several trsops of cavalry. J
His excellency the governor left his feat at |
Roxbury, this morning, for the field of re- j
view, under escort of two companies of 1
horse. To-morrow he will return, escorted
by four troops of cavalry. Many of the
refpcftable inhabitants of this town, will
be present at the review.
[These troops are all in complete uniform
âblue broad-cloath, with various facings.
Attached to this division is a body of dra
goons, consisting of 500 men also in com
plete uniform.]
On Friday hft, another effort was made
to launch the frigate Conflitution. At the
instant the shores were removed she started,
.and glided to the water with a regular rapi
dity, which promised a handfomc comple
tion of the wishes of a very numerous collec
tion of the inhabitants of Boston and its vi
cinity; but after moving about 30 fe-t, she
suddenly flopped. As she was just then en
tering on the temporary wharf, erefted to
support the ways, ij was conceived unfafe
to make further attempts to get her off, till
there was the most perfect assurance of her
finifhing her launch ; as it wjs dreaded her
weight, resting on the wars, might occasi
on it to fettle, and the consequences be very
serious. What was the real impediment to
her launching on this latter day, wc are un
able to determine/ It is ascribed to several
causes. The fettling cf the groundâthe
tightness of the bligeways, &c. But too
much pjaife cannot be bellowed on the inge
nious Conftruftor, whose prudence and fidel
ity so evidently triumphed over his ambition
and resolution. Vic hear, the workmen will
as usual, be employed upon the frigate, and
that the launching is deferred till about the
19th of October.

9F SANTHONAX.
The following interesting particulars of the
proceedings at Cape Francois, refpedling
Santhonax, from the 16th to the 29th of
August, we received by a gentleman pas
senger in the brig Democrat, arrived on
Thursday.
On the 16th of August general Touffaint,
with part of his cavalry, arrived at the Cape
from Gonaives ; on the 17th, the regular
troops and militia were summoned by beat
of drum through all the ttreets to a general
review the next morning. At this review,
general Touffaint harangu ed the troops, ex
horted them to support the laws of France,
and never to deviate from the true principles
of republicans. After the review was over,
general Touffaint arrested the aid-du-campf
of Santhonax, and sent him on board a ves
sel in the harbor. On the fame evening the
gerieral fujrimoned all the commanders and
generals of the Cape and the neighboring
diftrifts, before him, and presented a paper
for them to sign, the purport of which was
the crimination of Santhonax, and to fliew
the necessity of his bting sent to France :
this paper they all refufed iigning, except
the commandant Chriftophe, who declared
that he would sign it, conscious he would
serve his country, and probably save the ef
fufion of much blood. On the morning of
the 20th, general Touffaint waited on San
thonax, and told hire that he mull positive
ly embark on board the ship Indian for
France, and answer for his conduft during
his administration ; that he would give him
to the 25th to arrange his affairs, but that
he must on that morning be out of the har
bour of the Cape, or his head should an
swer for it : an order was in consequence
given to get the above ship ready for sea,
and two seamen from each of the American
veffelr m the harbour were put on board to
assist in rigging her.
General Touffaint then went out to Petit-
Ance with his cavalry, part of which he en
camped there, and stationed the remainder
of them on the Heights of the Cape, to cut
off all communication between the town and
country, and the Cape was embargoed both
by land and water.
On the morning of the 25th, the ship
failed with the commissary Santhonax, ac
companied by a confidential Spanish officer,
\vith whom was entrusted general Touffaint's
dispatches : the ship was to touch at Port
au-Paix, to procure more seamen; but when
they came off the island of Tortuga, com
missary Santhonax called the Spani/h officer
to him, told him he was not ignorant of his
being charged with Touffaint's dispatches,
and opening a chest containing 10,000 joes
in gold, offered him what part of them he
pleafed, provided he would let him fee the
contents of them ; this the officer refufed,
declaring at the time that nothing should
prompt him to break the trull put in him.
Santhonax then told hi in he was as much
corn miliary on bÂ«ard the (hip as he was it
<
- the Cape -he ordered the officsft trunks to
be hr.&fe offifgyfewd- Â«lx diipstclits,, sead
' thcin, and afterward â â¢ lore them up, and put
, the Spaniard ashore on the island of Tortuga
- without any clothes except what he had on,
- | from whence he got to the Cape.
| On the 28th there was another gtnenj re
, view of the. troops arid militia, at which
1 general Touffaint addr;ffed. them* telling
[them that the reason for his fhippiog off the
t 'ComtniHary was, that he had laid
i- a plan to detach thcgovemmfrit of the island
. from France, and not to acknowledge her
. 'any longer; that, he was. to be the chief
r 1 ruler of the island ; that he had iffijed out
I wine and money to gain the present leading
men of the Cape on his fide, so as to be able
. cffe&ually to put his bafff proje&s ill fcrce.
The general also said that helcnewthe.names
of all that-were concerned, would point them
1 out, aodthat .he would 4v> every thing in his
: power for the good of his country. The
â  fame day general Laveller, colonel Roderic,
I and another commandant were arretted, and
t were to be tried; in a few days.
, It is fupppfed that general Touflaint has,
by his spirited co;iduÂ£t and the discovery of
Santhonax's plot, saved all the white inha
bitants on the island from being massacred.
The general.has also allured them that in a
few days he would lay the whole of Santho
: nax's plan before v them. Conjpftures were
â¢ various as to the rout whiph Sanihonax had
taken ; but it was mostly expe&ed he would
i go to some' Spanish fettlpment.

MR. FENNO,
I have observed, with the utmost regret,
in several late papers, a great number of pa-'
ragraphs, which were evidently intended to
injure a medical character of the higheflt esti
mation, both in Europe and America.
In desiring you to inferc the following re
marks on these paragraphs, I rely on that
candor and impartiality, which, at leal}; in re
gard to fcientific subjects, oyght to charac
terize every.public print.
The torrents of abuse which have so a
bundantly been poured'on Dr. Rulh, seem
to have arisen from a desire of wounding his
feelings as an individual ; of injuring hia re
putation as a physician ; and of preventing
â¢the general introduction of his mode of prae
tice. J}ut the enemies of Dr. Rush may be
assured that their vile and illiberal scandal
cannot disturb the tranquillity of his exalted
mind. In the present instance the tongue
of malice will as ineffedtually ftied its venom,
as it did at the time when our late illustrious
president retired from the chair of govern
ment.
"JThe objeft of the labours of Dr. Rush is
the improvement of the science of medicine.
Ht finds an ample reward in the approba
tion of his own conscience ; his endeavours
havt been crowned with success, and he has
added largely to the stock of human hap
piness.
With a view, probably to injure the re
putation of the-Dr. as a medical pra&ition-*
er, he-has been emphatically stigmatized by
the name of a' quack. With equal proprie
ty might we denominate Newton an illite
rate pretender to philosophy, or Homer a
poetaster.
Those feeble attacks which have been
made oft our American Hippocrates, can have
but little effect in blading or injuring his
fame ; like the fhort-ljved ephemero", they
are limited to the existence of a Jingle day.
The" principles 'of medicine which are
taught and promulgated by Dr. Rufli, have
been afftrted-by one of your paragraphifts,
to be 1* contrary to reaCoji. aud experience."
I take the liberty, however, boldly to de
clare, that they will* eventually triumph o
ver all op'pofition, merely because they are
molt ftridly iupported by reason and by ex
perience. It isliot a; new thing, that men,,
who by their exertions have promoted in an
eminent degree, the cause of science and hu
manity, are rewarded with detraftion and
ingratitudeâThis is not the lirff time that
" truth has been Dr. Har
vey's immortal discovery of the circulation
of the blood, was long a-matter of dispute
and calumrryâHe wasabufed and perfect
ed 5 but the names of his perfeeutors, like
the animals which have paid the price 6f his
discoveries, are consigned to eternal oblivion.
It may be necessary to add, that in spite
of all opposition, the mode of practice pur
sued by Dr. Rush is advocated by the most'
refpedtablephyficians of Philadelphia ; and,
from an appeal to reason and experience,
every liberal and unprejudiced mind will be
convinced, that it is the most fuccefsful
method of treating the yellow fever.

CAUTION.
WHEREAS a/fombination of men in this
county have undertaken to enrich thÂ«m
felves.by fabricating titles to sundry valuable trails
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New
Yoik, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which
trails of land large sums of money have been paid
to those fraudulent men, by innocent parchafers â¢
It is. therefore just thit public information (hould
ke given, to the end, that the irjured eiay feekre
drefs while the men have property, and are to be
found. TJiofc who have been difcovercd are Tru
man Harrifou, Jofcph Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several other; who go under fi&itious names. It i>
supposed that the lands offered fcr sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at lead worth fitty thousand
dollars. Snch as we have afluol knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and 11, Otfego patent,
thousand acres each,the a&ual property ofWilliam
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chaumont,' now of Paris, and James Avenll
and others, ot this State. There is fame grounds
to suppose that the lands of Riehard Wells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, areSinder tlâir
management.âThe Printers will do well to.give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public agninft purchasing those lands, as also to de
prive those men in future"from nv.pofmg on indivi
duifs, which their .education and adiliefs have en
abled tliem to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a Ihopkeepcr of some note in this country.
The following affidavits will set in a clear point
of view the wickedness of those men, which when
the public have perused, will induee them to ex
cufc the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 28th, 17J7.
I Thomas Kelly, of the Crunty of Otfego, hav
