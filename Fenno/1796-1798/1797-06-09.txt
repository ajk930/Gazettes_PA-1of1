" Philadelphia, 2d June, 1797-
" Sin; 1
" WE have this day agreed to a report in
erf liter to the Preftdert's Speech, which is all f
the bufmefs we have done since the meeting of v
Cor.grefr; and which I would fend you, but it I
is too lengthy for a letter. It hits eojl the coun-
try at leafl nineteen or twenty thousand dollars ; t
the daily expense of Congress being eflimated at j
about one thousand dollars, and which neither f
the corftitution nor laws of this country have t
required of us, or even warranted in my opin- c
ion. It is an evil introduced by our predecessors,
who wished tO'be aping oftcr monarchical pomp ;
and parade ; forgetting that they were citizens, i
and not fubjeSs. In the course of the debates <
upon this fubjeS, amendments were brought for- |
ward which ultimately prevailed to this effeÃ : f
IVe cherish the hope that the Preftdent will fend [
an Ambassador, or Envoy Extraordinary to f
France, who shall declare to that Republic un- â >
equivocally, that, the United States are willing j:
to rcrrjtve all inequalities which may exifibetween {
her and other foreign relations with the United t
States, and require that France would on her a
part make good thi spoliations committed on our 1
neuiral rights.â The friends to this amendment Â£
(amongfl whom I was one)hefitatedâPerfuaded
it wasbetterto try farther negotiations,&wifhing r
rather to conciliate than irritate the French into c
war. This principle was opposed by the friends t
to the original reportfrom the committee. They n
urged that we had fufficient cause to go to war e
with the French, in as much as the Executive e
DireSory refufed to receive our Ambassador, ti
and called him Anglo-American ; that her pride Â®
ought to be humbled; that America was able to ,
do it, if fie would Jhew the frmnefs of the c
Emperor, and assume the manly tone of Great
Â£~:Z >i' v ! W"'' latter of which (as their J
arguments "joeniprove) we ought to form an
alliance ofenfive and tvotild t
do great things. Again-, that zue kjd no right
to ie l the President that we had an opinion
it would be affum'tng a Aitlatorial flation, even (
to tell him we had a thought or a w 'tfh about r
the matter ; nntwithflandwg he had called Con- \
grefs for that express purpose. Other members \
went Jlill further, whose firmnefs I lament, and *
whose politics I very much qucflion ; for Ido 1
not heptate to declare, that I am afraid that j
there are many members in Congress, whose fin- (
cere dfire is to involve us in a war with the |
mfl powerful nation in Europe, where we mufl \
hazard every thing, put every thing at flake i
without tie mofl dijlant profpeci of gain, and in <
JLort, when we cannot gain. What unwise '
policy I Infiead cf shewing a dfire to queflion
the public councils, to view thepajl conduS, and
to provide for the future welfare, it appears
more than ever the prevailing <fnd exulting
maxim, that government mufl be supported;
mixed too with a considerable degree of bitter
tufs againjl all those who queflion its proeeed
ings.
" That government mufl be supported, is a
maxim jufl and incontrovertibly true, when
rightly underflood. But a disposition to remove
r.'ifs, under any regulations whatever, is ac
, imtrd by those who even admit and lament
'r cxijlcnce, as an attack upon the conftitu
'l authorities, or even the constitution itfelf,
. â  -ih fuffers from them. It is by this fenfa
ihat the authors of our present calamities
lire cheri/hed and supported by those whocondemn
them ; whilfl, on the other hand, those who
with wisdom ond perseverance oppose all those
meafurcs which produce them, are discounten
anced and djirufed. Hence nothing is more
certain of being acceptable with the multitude
than extravagant afferthns in favor of ihat
fide of the queflion which the individual hap
pens to efpoufc : thegroffejl allujions have in that
cafe found credit. The truth of this remark
we have a recent 'tnflance of in the Richmond
paper of Mr. Davis of the 2\th ult. wherein
are tbefe degrading words : " We of the Grand
Jury of the United States for the diflriÃ of
'Virginia, present as a real evil the circular let
ters of the Members of Congress." In an
swer to Ms, Ido mojl Jtncerely lament, that
;mofl of our political disputants, newspaper wri
' tirs and pamphleteers, seem to let local attach
ments, pnrty spirit, or ambitious views, take
preference of truth, in search of which scarce
ly can we find a sentence of fair, vnbiajfed rea
faning, in d whole page or pamphlet. At the
fame time, are not the rights of the people puck
at in â¢ this mode of doing buftnefs ? I would
* vjl, how are the people to know what is doing
on the foor of Congress, vnlefs they have the
informa:kr. f -jrn their Reprefintatives, if there
is not a newspaper printed in every neighbor
. hood'? And as this is not the cafe, what better
way can be devfed, than for ibe members of
each diflria tocutlfnm the gnat mass of fluff
_ -fontflinsdinjhe pubiit;pri/::s, and coflmnfe it in
to one paper, which may the mei-e eaftly be con*
jvcyed to their conJ)'ttver.ts : for it 'cannotlefup
pofed that a member -could write as and
' as.often, as the people far from. him.
And again, what was the intent of freaking
of letters ? 'Was it merely for the purpose oj'ac
cohmodating members tn write to f amities ?
For my own fart, I think otherwise. I f'p
fnfe it was intend:dthat the ptoijejhonld kr.ow
femething elfbeftds the bis.ness \f the tax ga
tberer ivhcn he ccr.cs* But cjrJid the.
â thix ismt all tlsal is n:.v," !j that fnmyjs'pre-. V

Kingly government â ? If they have not, let them x

In the mean time, Irtqurjl furb gentlemen its dif- n

The following extra&, on r '-c autSentictty of
which you may rely, as well as on the tru-h of r

it proves that if the Bricifil iniprefs teamen from (

ing a aitich greater nUmier from them. It may
tc Lch us to moderate our anger for a|jgreflions,

Extrafl of a letter from Antigua dated sift OISO- c
bcr 1796. t
Mr. wrote by , and I hope has f
fatisfied you that his sentiments coincide pix feiSly r
with yours (in the fubjeft of yonr correspondence, '
I know he has had a great deal of trouble, durinjr t
this whole war, in rescuing Americans improperly V
detained by the officers of the navy, and a very
troublefoms part of his duty it mufthavc been.â j
Jullice requires however that what can be laid in ,
palliation of the conduit of those rough ions of
the ocean, towards the Americans, ihould not be v
omitted :â¢ The Americans have exerted wonderful d
induflry in fecre:ing and carrying away deserters
from our Navy; you may judge of their diligence v
by what they have done, during the hmricane
months in this small Illand; one seventy four and ''
five frigate*, lying at Englifn Harbour, have loft f
fincc the month of August above three hundred t
men by desertion ; 1 very large reward has been r
, granted by the legislature of the Island for appre-
hending these. men, and after the mjft diiligent
fearth not above thirty of them can be found in the
whole country: we have had no vessels of our I
own here to convoy them away, for our {hips all
failed before the commencement of the Hurricane
r feaion: they have doubtless been carried ofl by t
the American vessels that are conllantly corring ,
and going, and allthefe seamen are a loss to great '
Britain at lead for the remainder of the war. I '
think some pains (hould be taken by the American I
Government to prevent Britiih seamen from being (
smuggled in a mannar so improper : or some ar- ]
rangement (hould be made between the two
countries, by which proper officers might be au
thorised on the part of Ureat Britain and the Unit
ed States to go on board of American vessels im
mediately on their entry into Britiffi ports, and j
examining the number ef their seamen ; another
examination to take place when they are quitting
the port-. this, if properly conduced, would not
only effedlua ly prevent them from carrying off
Britilh Seamen, but be the means ofpreferving ]
their own from the violent hands of the Navy
Officers.
Extras of a letter from Holland, Feb. 7, 1797.
Since Twrote you lad, I am informed that
the French Direflory have ordered Mr. Pinck
ney to leave France, and he has determined to
come into this country and wait here for the
GidÂ«Â« of his government.-^âAt the time when
the refill to receive him took place, an inti
mation wis given him, that it was expedted he
would depart, but he refufed to go, without a
written order. This was delayed Until the Di
' reftory received their last dispatches from the
United State 6 and the most recent statement of
; the eleflion of President and Vice-Prefident.
I havÂ« already written you in what manner they
consider this event âwith what mortification
they have found their influence inefficient to
' turn the choice, and how much they are incli
â¢ ned to persist in their system by their proximity
to Juccefs. This last incident strongly corrobo
. rated the cpision.
A citcumfiance which cannot eft-ape oblerva
, tion, is the treatment at this time experienced
from the fame quarter by Mr. Monroe. He
' has been upon a tour through this country. He
' came strongly recommended to an influential
r member of the committee of foreign affairs,
. and to the secretary of that committee, who as
well as the French minifler here, paid him the
greatest attentions. This member of the com
mittee is devoted totally to France. He gave a
1 fplsndid entertainment to Mr. Monroe, at which
1 were present other members, and the secretary
t cf the committee, and the American miniller.
- After dinner while they were fitting at table,
t he aceofled Mr Monroe, and the American
mimfierby name, and gave, for toast, "The
- peuple ot America." The secretary upon whom
' the American minifler instantly turned his eye,
" was apparently confuftd, and inflead of re
peatiDg the toast as given, fubflituted in its
n liead " the United States." Mr. Monroe said
0 neither the one nor the other.
r e This anecdote may appear trivial, but is a
clear indication of things far othcrwife.
I saw Mr. Monroe almost every day while he
1 was here, he converted with me upon our pub
e lie affairs, but with great reserve, particularly
]t -concerning our situation with France. His de
portment evidently discovered an exasperated
it and strongly agitated mind, though his conver
i fation was in every particular extremely gnard
d ed. He went from the Hague to Arafterdam,
where he flayed only a few days, and from
whence he very suddenly set out for Utrecht on
his return to Paris, on the fame day when the
'/ news arrived here of the order to depart given I
t- to Mr. Pinckney.
1- In this country the name of the Vice-Prefi
it dent (Mr. Adams) is remembered with refpefl
and attachment by the people of all parties.
1" The proofs of it, whick I have observed, are
, innumerable, and mrlt particularly fmce the
'' recent American cleflions, h:ve become an ob- j
jefl of immediate notice and attention. There
1- is however a power extant in this country,
'ie which overrules all attachment and will either
-I silence refpeift, or render its voice unavailing.
U To an orcer f.gncd from the French Diredory
be it what it may, no refinance can be made,
'Â£ and hever is attempted.âlf, therefore, they
(hould require of this government to suspend
re all intercourse, commercial or or both
r- with the United States, tbey could not refufe

B f be a meajure extremely odious to thÂ« pcoplt,
ir andthst in conference 6f such a difference,
they would fufftr niucb. ir.ore injury than Aratr
icaos. If, tHerrfore, the Amnican minifler
(hould be ordered away from hcace, as Mr.
p- Pinckney has been from Paris, you will tot be

The Address In answer to the Speech of
the Preiidcr.t of the Unijed States, passed
the House of Rcprefentatives by a majority
of TWENTY-SIX. Sixty-two Ayes and '
thirty-fix Noes. This Addreis solemnly as- ((
fureo the President of the United States, ,
That they believe that the conduft of the z
Government has been just and impartial to-
wards Foreign Nations. r
It is true that the majority against ftrik-
ing out these words was only 8. The faft
however is, that on the final decision there
was a. great majority in favor of the Ad-
dress containing the sentiment.
To suppose that any of that majority Â°
would aft counter to this solemn declaration,
may square with the politics of a foreign ?
faftion, but would be a gross refleftion on
the honor and integrity of any man who
pretends an attachment to the interest of the

COMMUNICATION.
The Aurora of Wednesday last acknow- '
ledges, in plain language, Mr. Jefferfon's
fathering the letter to Mazzei. This is an 1
importantâa precious confession. The '
friends of the government will aft according
ly. The intelligence ought to be commu- 1
nicated from Maine to Georgia, that the
real sentiments of the Vicc-Prejident may
be generally known.
The Aurora of Wednesday last asserts,
<Â« that some members of 1 Congress dined at
the Britilh ministers, on the 4th of June, to
celebrate the birth-day of the Britilh Mo
narch."âWe are authorised, by a gentle
man who was present at that dinner, to con
tradift positively the aflertion in the Aurora,
and to assert that there was not present any
member of the federal governmeut, nor any
member of Congress The above attempt
in the Aurora to deceive the public by lies
is worthy of notice.
One of the Aurora-men asserts, that the
letter from New-York, publilhed in this Ga
zette, relative to the eleftion in that city,
is a fabrication. The original letter is in
the hands of the editor hereof.
In one of the French Gazettes publilhed
in this city (not Aurora) the speech of
Ned Froth is thus eulogized :
" After having proved with equal energy
and truth ! the jujlice of most of the ac
cufationsof France,he(Froth) reproached the
United States with forgetting the services
which the French nation have rendered
them."
" I am, cried he, one of those whose
number is daily diminifhingâ[" A preci
ous confeflion"âit is high time that such
patriots should become fcarce.J
To meet the decided approbation and even
eulogium of an enemy, must be regarded as
rather lame evidence of the patriotism of
the objeft of it.

The repeated accounts we receive of mis
representations circulated in France by our
jacobins, must convince the Americans that
the differences between the Government of
that country and of the United States, has
proceeded mostly from the arts and treache
ry of our citizens. When we fee such abo
minable fallhoods as those contained in Mr.
Jefferfon's letter, propagated through Eu
rope by those charafters who have held high
offices in America, we are tempted to apolo
gize for the resentment of a nation exposed
to those deceptions. The evil is deep root
â  ed among ourselvesâand unless some mode
can be adopted to restrain these traiterous
f correspondencies, between the faftious of
â¢ our own citizens and foreign governments,
we (hall never be represented to Europeans
in our just charafttr.
We have taken pains, Snce the opening
1 of Spring, to make enquiries of gentlemen
, from different parts of the country, ref
j pefting t,hc state of the public mind in the
' interior. We find but one opinion, as to
r public affairs, the farmers, who conflitute
' the strength of our Republic, and who be
â to no party, as a body wish foracon
y tinuaace of Peace. At the fame time, they
it are extremely irritated at the injuries we
d fuffer from France, and if no honourable
e means can bejound to prc-ferve peace, they
will, with 'jxrfeft unanimity, and great ,spi
rit, encounter the perils of war. . Such we
may be affnred is the unanimous sentiment of
.< the Eaftem States. N. T. Paper.

The" Quotidienne" aParispaper,makes in
the following interesting remarks on the li'
late Proclamation of the Executive Direc- ti
tory, relative to the Primary Assemblies :
" The Direftory formally invites all citi- g
zens not to choofc those who regret-the an- ft
cient regimen. I beg to aik," fays the a
writer, "what it metns by the words ancient tl
regimen. Does it wish to exclude those
who regret the tranquility we enjoyed under f<
our kings ? No ; the Direftory has no in-
tention to perpetuate disorders. Does it &
allude to those, who regret the time when Â°
our property was held sacred ? No ; the n
Direftory will not protest and encourage r
pillage. Does it speak of those who regret a
the day when no blood was Ihed on the fcaf- ti
fold, but that of robbers and affafiins ? c
No ; the Direftory seeks the retiirn ps 1
the reign of justice. Does it mean to point t:
out those, who regret the Lettres de Ca- d
chet ? No'; the Revolutionary Committees
have made us forget them. Or does it per- t
haps allude to those who regret the reign of: t
Religion ? No ; Government has formally 0
proclaimed the liberty of religious worihip. ! <3
What then do you mean by ancient regi- 0
men ? A king, no doubt ; but he was r
murdered by you. Besides, the word king f
is void of sense, and a Republic of frogs
alone can demand a king without making men- r
tion of a government. A king may be as well e
at the head of a Republic, as at the head J
of a Monarchy. The Spartans were certainly 1
stout republicans, and yet they had two 1
kings. Poland was a Republic, and yet Â£
Poland had a king. The word king is there-
fore a bug bear to frighten children and c
nurses. The word ancient regimen conse
quently implies an absurdity, and should not 5
be found in a Proclamation' of the Direc- 1
tory. London paper.
MR. fp.nno, | :
AS the right of a Neutral Nation to protest*
its commeree by convoys, is now agita- 1
ted, I inclose a quotation from Puffendorf '
on that fubjeft, and with you to insert it '
in your Gazette. A. B. 1
In the year 1692 the celebrated Mr. Pus- 1
fendorf was consulted on the free navigation
of the Northern Powers of Europe, during
a war between the Englilh, Dutch and
' French, when he gave the following opi
nion :
" If the Northern Princes can maintain
! " their trade with France by fending strong
" convoys with their fleets, I fee nothing to !
" blame in it,, provided their vessels do not j
. " carry contraband goods. The law s of j
" humanity and equity between nations do 1
Â«â¢ not extend so far as to require, without any j
( " apparent necessity, that one people should
" give up its profits to another."

f HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
r Wednesday, June 7.
Cmcluf.ori of Mr. S Smith's remarks,
t If the latter amendment was agreed to,
s he should be for striking out the whole, leav
-1 ing it general, because with Weft Indies in
it, it would be particularly pointed.
; They had been told of the loss fuftaifled
- by spoliations, and where it fell. He believ
Â£> ed it fell uppn the great body of the people
of America, and that the fall in the price of
1 produce had been occasioned principally by
s the Britilh admiral having forbidden the car
s rying o four provisions to Hifpaniola. The
Britilh fleet, in the Weft Indies, he said,
was supplied with provisions from Ireland,
whilst the French depended upon this coun
- try for supplies, so that they were our best
r customers there.
,t The gentlemanfromS. Carolina (Mr. W.
if Smith) supposed the cry of war would have
lb no effeft in the country ; but let us refer
â - back to to the British treajy, said he, when
>- that gentleman was so loud in his cry- But
r. that was a war with Great Britain, and not
1- with France. At that time there was not
h a British tear which was not called forth by
i- the appealswhich were made on this ground,
d But, Mr. S. said, he did not then fear
t- war, nor did he now, if they took prudent
le measures. The gentleman said,, his plan was
is to prevent war, and yet he proposed to go
)f to Jight and Jink the vessels of a particular na
s, tion. This was a way of prefervirig peace
is peculiar to himfelf.
If merchant's vessels were armed, they j
ig would fcrve the purpose of privateers, which
â ll might be used against our own vessels. Tin's I
f- was 3 risk he did not chufe to run. But it
le was a curious faft, that at the fame that we
to are proposing to permit the merchants to
te arm, they express a disinclination to it ; be
e- cause they love their country bette vthap their
n- own interest. But the gentleman had said
that the expence of insurance would be lef
ve fened by this arming- On the contrary, he
ile (and he was an underwriter) should confiiler
ey the ri(k greater from their having guns. In
?i- 4e<*'he found the InCurancf Offices were all
ve against the measure.
of But the gentljrrvan fays, let.the French
know we are preparing. He trusted we
(hoaid prepare a defence which could not of
fend any oue. Let us do all we can to pro â 
mote peace ; let tl>d negociations go on. It
would he a fine ltory, indeed when a reconci
liation was about to take place bctwnct our
negociatdrs and the French government that
they (hou'd hear we were {inking her priva
teers in- the Weft Indies. They would
doubtless fend them about their bulinefs.
The gentleman from S. Carolina seemed
to thick it was right for our veflek to go".
into Rebel .ports in the Weft Indies ; and
told them < tour men being taken by Vittor
HugueSj coaiideredas pirates and hung (Mr.
W. S. denied having said our citizens were
Lung) Mr. S. read Victor pro
clamation, (though he said he had no more
refpeft for him than that gentleman,
as he had loft 6or 7,<360 dollars by him)
and (hewed that those persons were only con
sidered as traitors who failed out of rebel i
ports, and not citizens of the United States.
Nor were those ports conlldered as rebel
ports which were taken by the Engliih,
(Cape Nicholas Mole was one of those) but
merely those which were in a state of rebel
lion, to which, if we were determined to
trade, it would certainly lead to war.
Mr. S. said he was surprised to hear the
gentleman from S. Carolina make one cori
feffion, viz. that the French minister had
allured our government the prizes taken in
the Weft Indies were unauthorized, because
when he had aiferted the fame thing, on a
former occasion, that gentleman denied it.
Mr. S. inftfted that the French trade carri
ed on to the Weft Indies was a produftive
one, and that payments were in geperal
made as punctual, as in any otber parts, and
referred to m?jor Mountflorence's letter for
an aft of generosity .never (hewn by the Bri
tish ; nay, he thought there was a better
chance of getting money owing from France
than there was for getting it for any spolia
tions committed by the Britiih, and novv;un
der adjudication.
Mr. S. concluded by faying, be had ano
ther reason for opposing the meaiufc. Two
thirds of his constituents were farmers, and
one third citizens, and they enjoined him to
do all in his power to keep this country out
of war ; he thought the rejection of this
resolution as tending to this end, and there
fore he opposed it.
! Mr. Harper went into a defence of the
resolution at considerable length. lie deni
ed that the French could take reaforiable
grounda of offence at the mcafure, as the
power would only be given under such re
ftriftions as mull prevent it from being abus
ed, as men would never wantonly forfeit the
sums in which they were bound to obey their
order?. Â»
When Mr. Harper fat down there was
a loud call for the committee to rife (it being
past three) when Mr. Livingfton rose, and
hoped the question would be taken. The
: question was put for the committee to rife,
| and carried 42 to 40.
J A bill was received from the Senate for
raffing and organizing an additional corps
â  of artillerists and engineers, which was read
the firft time ; when Mr. Macon moved that
it be rejefted, as he favv no rrecefiity for in
, creasing our army. The-motion was oppo
sed by Mr. W. Smith, who said the men
. | would be wanted for supplying the garri
i sons ; and in order to get rid of the quef

ried.
FRIDAY, MAY 16.
In committee of the whole, Mr. Dent in the

: | Mr. Dennis said, being unacquainted with
f j the fubjedl, In a manner, and newly honored

j . have remained had he not observed thf
ground offome gentle.r,en's arguments, which
had roused him to a sense of his duty; he, un
der that imprefDon.came forward, not merely
to examine many of the arguments introduced
on this <>ccafjon, but to Ihew his reaforis why
, he could not vote in favor of the amendment
now before the Committee.
It appeared from the turn the debate had ta
ken, as though the quetUon was, whether A
, merica fnould enter into a war or nut, âat leali
- it would appear so to persons attending to the
[! debate ; indeed, he said, be (hould not be at all
fuprifed if at this moment waggon loads of pe-

" the French Republic : was the question alked

[To be continued.]
THURSDAY, JUNE 8.
The bill for preventing the exportation of
arms and ammunition was read the third time j
âwhen,
Mr. Lyon said, except the word cannons 1
were (truck out of it, he could *ot consent
to vote for the passing of the bill!
Mjc.W. Smith called for the yeas and
nays upon the paffmg of this bill, which
were accordingly taken, and were 79 in
favor of it, and 8 against it. The nays were
Messrs. Elmendorff, Findley, Locke, Ly
on, Macon, M'Clenachen, Nicholas, and
Venable.
Mr. W. Smith, from the committee to
whom was referred the bill for preventing
the fitting of privateers, made a report,
which recommended an agreement to alt the
amendments of the committee of the whole,
except one for prohibiting citizens from
taking command or entering on board of any
vessel with intent to cruise against vessels of
the United States, instead of which they
recommended another to be enadted in a se
parate law, confining this bill entirely to
private vefll'ls.
The House went into a committee of the
whole on this report, agreed to it, and after
wards took it up and agreed to it in the
House, and the bill was ordered to be en
gvoffed for a third reading.
Mr. W. Smith moved that a comnlittee
be appointed to prepare and report a bill to
prohibit citizens of the United States from
taking the command of or entering on board
any (hip at' of any foreign power. A
Committee of three was accordingly ap
pointed.
Mr. CoiT heljeved that some inconveni
ences arose from vessels which had been taken
prizes' from citizens of the United States,
being again fold to citizens of this.country,
atid from their obtaining frelh registers for
them, as the doing of it appeared to be an
additional inducement to captures. Pie
therefore proposed a resolution to appoint a
coromjticc to conftder the propriety of pro
hibiting tlie pra&ice, in future, which was
agreed to, and a committee of three ap
pointed.
Mrt W, St*ith moved that the House
take Hp the bjll which was under considera
tion yeftcrday,-when an adjournment took
jjlftrt, viz. the bill for raising additional carps
of artilufifts and engineers ; when
Mr. Macon said he (hould not renew this
motion for rejecting t!< : bill, as it might
cÂ«iÂ£ume mora time than letting it take its
regular covirfe.; but he did not think he
'.hewed any want ofcaiuior in wifliing to get
rid os-it iri that.way. The- gentleman from
South-Carolina talked as much about can
dor, aad Ibewed aa Ft(tie of it as man ill
that Honfe- The bill was referred to a com
tn?tl *e cf the v.'hclc, to-morrow.
Mr. L tvjNdfiTOhi said, that it was well
known that the qoinmilTipnerg for fettling
the British dells were now orgawzed and
vjr.dy to proceed U tiaSr.cfe. It had been 1
fuggefied that great evijs might grife fur '
want of an agent to *hcc':..tbe. claims of the i
Britifti ; lie (liould tlK'jrefore propose that
such ah agent be appointed. He laid a re
fohltion upon the "table, direfting that pro
riljon be made bylaw for enabling the Ex
ecutive to appoint an agent for this purpofi.
The house again rcfo'.vcd itCelf into a com
ttiittef Of tbC whole on the (late of the union,
and the fifth refokrtion. viz. that refpedting
the arming of merchants vessels, with the
amendments which had been yesterday of
fered, being under configuration.
Mr. Otis said it ought to be considered
that they were not about to giant a privi
lege to our vessels to arm in their own de
fence, but to modify that right, He tho't
all difcuflions on the law of nations were
secondary ; for j if our own law did no.t for
bid the practice, it was neceflary something
(hould be done to regulate it," and when the
bill was brought in, gentlemen might direst
tKeir objections to such parts of it as they
thought proper; There could be no doubt
that the law of nations warranted the prac
tice ; but it might.be our policy to put it
under a stricter control than other nations
had done, because all other commercial na
tions had fleets to protect their commerce.
He spoke of the difference of carrying arms
on board a vessel and using them.
Mr. O. referred to a provision in the law
of nations, which, if it did not positively
acknowledge the right of merchants vessels
of neutral nations to be armed, at least im
plied it. It was, that vessels of war have a
right to examine merchants vessels, and rf
they make any resistance, they (hall be con
sidered as lawful prize, which he said sup
posed them to be in a capacity to fight. It
was acknowledged that this power might be
abused, and therefore it was that he propo
sed to reftrift it in the mqft effeftual manner.
At preferlt there was nothing to prevent
the owner of any veflel from arming it, from
which great disorder might ensue, but the or
der of the Executive, which might be any
day revoked.; butthefe regulations were in
tended scrupulously to avoid cause of offence
to any nation, and the improper conduct of |
the captain of any vessel would be disavow- â 
ed. The only question was, which was the
best Way of doing this. All were agreed '
that the regulatibn would be proper to the i
East Indies and the Mediterranean, but there
seemed some doubt as to the propriety of
including the Weft Indies.
Mr. Otis contended, that if the danger
in the Weft India seas was as great from un
authorised cruisers as it were in the East In
dia or Mediterranean seas (and he thought
this had clearly appeared) the fame regula
tion ought to be extended to that quarter.
But it was said it might be the cause of war.
He took it for granted such reftridtions
would be made in the law as would prevent
any real pretext for war, and if the French
were determined to aft upon fpec'wus ones,
they would not want them ; and if they had
them not, they would manufacture them,
and nothing that we could do would prevent
them from making war upon us.
Mr. Otis denied that resentment could
have all the effeÂ£t afcribedtoit, since it would
only operate to any effeft upon a few indi
viduals ; nor did he think the captains em
ployed in the Weft India service would be
less likely to consult the interests of their em
ployers and of their country, than those em
ployed in the East-India and Mediterranean
trade. He denied also that if a captain was
so imprudent as to force a vessel into a re
bel port that it would be a cause of war, nor
would the French Republic ever make it a
pretext of offence. Indeed, if it were a faÂ£t
that the unauthorized cruizers in the Weft
Indies were in rebellion to the French gov
ernment, we (hould, in fact be fighting their
battles by fitting out vessels to oppose their
unjuftifiable attacks.
The gentleman from New-York had ob
jefted to this proposition, because it appear
ed naked. He thought this no objection,
because the gentleman could take it out in
to the committee room and clothe it with
his own ideas. The gentleman from Penn
sylvania had said the expence would be an
objedtion ; but he might have known, that
no one would be forced into the regulation.
But it was said the merchants were against
arming their vessels. They were apt, he
said, to suppose,' that because half a dozen
persons with whom they conversed were of
their opinion, that every body thought a
like.
But suppose this was the opinion of some
merchants, did not they expeft there would
be other measures taken for the protedtion
of our trade. In order to put the matter
upon a right footing, gentlemen should fay
to the merchants, " We will do nothing ;
we are willing that privateers (hould not on
ly come off your Capes, but up to your ci
ty, and take your banks ; (he did not know
whether there would be any one found to
Welcome them) we want to go home ; the
weather getting warm, our own affairs have
r.eed of our attention." . But, added Mr.
O. if the merchants are averse to this pro
position, why do they not meet and declare
their opinions. If they were to do this, it
would have some weight with him.
Another gentleman had told them, that
the loss sustained by depredations upon our
commerce did not fall wholly upon our
merchants, but upon the public at large.
That the gentlemen from Pennsylvania
(hould have fupporteia theoretical idea of
this fort, would not have surprised liinf; but
that a gentleman, who was himfelf a mer
chant, lhould have given countenance to it,
was extraordinary. If the merchants and
insurers were to lose the whole of their capi
tals .by these fpoliatfons, would it be any
fatisfadtion to them to be told, that the far
mers would also be affedted by their losses ?
Or, if the matter was reversed, and a mil
dew ijiould destroy the crops of a number
of farmers, the iniafoitunc wcftild of'courfe
raise the price of grain, and the public
would be affedted by the misfortune, yet
the advance in price would be general, and
| the (jifrerirg would not be confined to those 1
whofV cropi bad been deftroycd.
Seeing then,faidMr. O.thatatircojEmcrce
is thus exposed, fliall we defiil from all pru
dcntrncafures* of prote&iilg'it ? Ifwedo,wc
fnalf be obliged to resort to the mortifying
alternative of putting our vessels undci'Bri
l'tjh convoys, or fuffer them to be captured ;
and he believed if nothing was done- for the
protection of cur trade, it would be foand
at the nekt feflion.of Cortgrefs, that all jhe
vefTels which had arrived fafe, would liave
been thus convoyed.
Mr. Otis concluded by A complaint at
the want of candor in charging gentlemen
who advocated this motion, with being ad
vocates of war ; he thought gentlemen had
used language in the course of the debate,
that they Would not have used out 'cf dcOrS.
He feared the time was coming wTien they
should be obliged to unite in the defence of
their common country, and he ithougbt it
would b; well to avoid all unreiuViable pro
vocation. But if gentlemen were determin
ed to fay, because he advocated the arming
of our merchants' veflels, that he advocated
a war proportion, and that it wo aid pro
duce war in fix months, he could not help
it. The public must judge betwixt them.
Mr. Varnum said the gentleman laftup
had taken much pains to P.iew that the citi
zens of the United States had a right to arm
their vessels, and to refill the attacks of fo
reign nations. If this were true, he was as
tonished the doftrine should have lain so long
dormant. But he believed right had not
been considered to exist, and he believed it
ought not to exist. Tho' the President had
forbidden the arming of merchants veflels,
yet gentlemen aflerted they had a right to
doit. (Mr. Otis interrupted Mr. V. to
read an extract from the President's speech
on the fubjetl, -where he fays he did not
doubt the policy andproppety of merchant's
arming thcirveffels. Mr. V. said the Pre
sident might not doubt the policy and pro
priety, and yet not be fatisiied as to the le
gality of the meafnre. If individuals had
this right, he hoped they should pass a law
before they rose to prevent its exercise ; as
he doubted not if this plan was gone into,
that this country would soon be involved in
the horrors of war.
Mr. V. wilhed to know what cause ex
isted at present more than for four years past
for going into this measure. Gentlemen
had brought forward many ideal depredati
ons committed by the French Republic, of
which no evidence had been attempted to be
adduced. They had proof indeed of three
or four veflels being taken into Francein the
report of Major Mountflorence, yet gentle
men exclaimed that our commerce was laid
at the feet of France. If this were so, why
did not the evidence lie before them ? The
cries of women and children which had been
the other day introduced, was not proof.
He believed those cries had been produced
by an overbearing spirit of speculation, in
this country, more than by the depredations
of any nation whatever. He saw nothing
in the French Republic like a wish to injure
the property of the citizens of the United
States. Mr. V. then took notice of the de
cree which they had pafled in refpedt to
the British, and doubted not, when our ne
gociators should fettle t'natbufinefs, that the
present misunderstanding would be done a
way, and they would be convinced of our
good wishes towards them. He did not
wonderthat the French should have been of
fended with this country ; he thought they
had cause for offenee in the British treaty ;
nor was he of opinion that our conduit tow
ards them had been more friendly than to o
ther nations, which he thought they had
some reason to expeit ; not but that he ap
plauded our executive in taking such a part
as was calculated to keep us out of the war.
He believed it would have been a wife tiling
j not to have entered into any treaty with ei
! thcr nation till the conclusion of the war.â
(The chairman reminded Mr. V. of the
| question.) He concluded with hoping we
j should wait the event of negotiation, with-
I out doing any thing which might eventually
lead to a war.
Mr." Nicholas would not again have
troubled the Committee had not the impor
tance of the question appeared to him to re
quire it. They were told that merchants
had a right -to arm their veflels, and a mo
tion was made to fanftion the arming of
them to the Weft Indies, in addition to the
East Indies and the Mediterranean, under
certain reftriftions. So that they were a
bout to admit the right of the merchants to
do the thing. It was neceflary therefore,
to enquire whether this was the praflice of
nations.
It was said there was no law to prevent
arming, yet the President had forbidden the
arming of merchant's veflels, except in cer
tain cases, and he flioidd not be willing to
believe that he would do what he had no
right to do. And surely no gentleman
would contend , that the President had the
power to do, or not to do, according to his
will. It was his bulinefs to execute the law,
and not to make it. He believed there had
been no hffitation, since the pafling of the
law in 1794, in believing that veflels arming
in the ports of the United States, were do
ing so with an intent to commit hostility.
To suppose the contrary, would be to bring
the Executive into a lituation which he did
not deserve.
The gentlemen declared it was their in
te'ntion to suppress a natural right. He
would not willingly dispute their intention,
but he believed this was not the whole-os it,
because the gentleman from S. Carolina had
' spoke of forcing our veflels into the rebel
ports of the Weft Indies, than which no
step could be taken which would sooner lead
to war. But gentlemen said that the law
of nations countenanced this doctrine, and
â said it remained with them who opposed it
to prove the contrary. The fact wireâthe
law of nations was silent upoo this point.
But, if it h;d been a beneficial thing, and
conducivethe happiness of a country,
*rorcld'it not have been at some time aited
upon, and noticed by the writers or. the law
of intions ? Arid is not tlieir silence, nret
ty lirong evidence that the right was never
exerciTcd ? The reason of the cafe was
ftrong.agisaft the praftfee ; aj, if unreftrain
ed> it wa3 acknowledged it would lead di
rectly to war, as it "Would have a tendeacy
to v,okte the rights of. other nation#; and
if tl.is would be she natural cmifequcDce of
the meafnre unfeftrained; lie believed tie
fame effefts would be produced, and not-,
with (landing aav restraints which raigiit be
enafktl to regulate "the practice: And if
they, authorized a pratlice which, produced
an evi|, it would be the fame as if they au
thorized the evil. -
But gentlemen fay this measure could
give the French no real offence, and if they
would act from specious ones, they would
never be in want of them. Mr. N. said he
did not want to remove specious pretences
of offence,^and if this country gave no solid
ones, he should never be heard to raise his
voice in favour of France. But it was his
opinion this proportion was pregnant with
real offence.
The gentleman last up seemed to think,
that if the merchants were indisposed to the
measure, that it would not b< carried into
efle&, and of course could do no harm ; but
tho' the generality of merchants might be
opposed to it, yet there may be enough rea
dy to enter into it, to involve the country
m mifchief. For, they could not fay, thus
far it shall go, and no farther, nor would
any bond which could not be entered into be
an efiedtual security for our peace.
He was surprized to hear the complaints
of the gentleman just fat down with refpeft
to attributing improper motives to gentle
men ; since he believed that gentleman had j
himfelf been as reprehensible in this refpedt '
as any other. Indeed, this very day, he had
spoke of the French coming up to our
wharves, and intimated certain perforis
would be ready to receive them. He th'o't
the admonition came illy from one who had
been twice obliged to recant what he had.
said in this way.
Mr. N. concluded with hoping the a
mendment would be rejected ; nor did he
wish the resolution to be agreed to without
it, since he believed if it pafled that House,
it would not pass the Senate, and if any law
pasted on the subject, he wished it to be so
exprcfled as to do away the fuppdfition that
the right in merchants to arm was acknow
ledged.
Mr. Swanwick next spoke against the
motion ; he was followed by Mr. Harper,
on the other fide. Meflrs. Brooks, W.
Smith and Williams also supported the a
mendment ; and Meflrs. S. Smith, Giles,
Gallatin and Macon opposed it. The ques
tion was then taken on inferring the JVeJI
Indies and negatived, there being 35 votes
in favour of it, and against it 46. A mo
tion was then made by Mr. Harper, for the
Committee to rife, which was negativedâ
there being only 32 votes in favour of it.
The question was tHbn taken on the firft a
mendment to insert Eajl Indies and the Me
diterranean, and negatived, there being 41
for it and 40 against it. The Chairman de
claring it to be negatived.
The question was about to be taken on
the resolution as amended, when Mr. Day
ton said he had an amendment to introduce ;
but as it was then past four oclock he should
move that the Committee rife. He would
