COMMUNICATION.
â  Mr. Fenno,
* I have frequently remarked, that when the scrib
blers in the Aurora are at a loss for new iubjefls of al
fafiination, they indulge their murderous habits by at
tempting to deprcciatt. the talents of gentlemen
who now prcfide at the head of the departments of
slate and treasury. It is rather lingular, however, that
in order to effeift their purpose, they lboald-be com
pelled to resort to the unmeaning exprefiion of " suc
cessors.in form," adopted by a mas, whose abilities
were never the objeit of envyâand to whose preten
fions for honelty, 1 belienf no person could be ambi
tious to lucceed.
S If the secretaries of slate and Â»f the treasury, ably
and faithfully dil'charge the duties ot'Â«their refpef\ivÂ£
offices, the public surely have no caule of complaint.
Upon what principle, therefore, can Mr. Bpche's cor
nd I reipondent's pretend to fay, that they are not equally
ca - : entitled to an encreafe of compensation with the other
"7 j officers of government? Is it becanfe they are not
ro" i members of feme foreign philosophic.l focietyâyr, ra
jm ther, becauft, they prefer living on the_fcanty stipend
allowed them by their country, lo imitating the base
- examples daily exhibited by pretended patriots? Let
the people determine.
Thursday last the Senators and Reprefentativs in
â Congrefe of the State of Delaware, pursuant to
refolufioni Â»f the Legiflatare, waited on the
President of the United States, with the follow
ing addreflts.
To GEORGE WASHINGTON,
Prejidtnt of the United States.
Sir,
THE Senate of the State of Delaware cannot
view with infeefibility your contemplated retire
ment from the fiift office of your country to flic
rrpofe of private life.
Upon Cuch an occasion to bfc silent and to with
hold the mod cordial exprÂ«fliou of Â«ur aifeilion, â 
refpeft and veneration, for your character, vould
1- be as ungrateful to you at it would be di/hoaorablc
s te ourselves.
It it in attempting therefore to do justice to our
ft feelings, and to discharge a patriotice dutyi that
we present this address as a tribute of gratitude,
. and a homage due to your virtues.
More than twenty years have elapsed since you
left the civil gouncils of America, to undertake
n and sustain the more difficult and perilois duties of
the chief military cammarid. The seven years con
, which ensued must have been to youa gloomy
n series of seven year's fufferings, except aÂ»it was re
lieved by temporary vidories, and the plafing hope
that the exertions of your country and the aids of
heaven, would crown yaur labours witi ultimate
success.
At the close of the important contelt wÂ® view
you in the command of a disciplined, sffeftipnate
and admiring army ; and from, the example of other
conquerors, we might have trembled for the fa'e of
our country, in the appiehenfion thaC itsptotccior
would become its tyrant.
j happily for the United States, and honora
bly for yotirfelf, and the chafer of human na-
Lure, the feelings of the conqueror, were loft in
those of the patriot; anil the i fÂ«,uations of ambi
tion were reprefled by the triumph of virtue.
Ihe glorious fpe&acle was presented to the
world, of a popular, powerful and fucccfsful gene
ral, atchieving the emancipation of his country, and
then tefigning his command to an unarmed repub- <
lie, voluntarily retiiing from the honors of office, :
and receiving in return the tribute not oi pr.-wer
i but of public gratitude.
We view you a second time in obedience to the :
unanimous veice of America, rciinquiftiing the en
joyment of your beloved retirement, and accepting
the chief magistracy of yeur country, in erder to 1
add character, credit and energy, to its govern- I
ment. That character, credit and energy, ycu have '
affilted, in forming, and fecuting to our govern- '
ment j' and wc hope they will be preserved, as well i
to perpetuate the memory of your virtues, as the â¢
happinefv Â°f your feliow-citizen*. i
We ad-dress you fir, in the name, and on the be- 1
half of the citizens we represent. We know that <
they unite with us in viewing your abilities with i
refpeÂ«, your virtues with veneration, and your '
fervicee with gratitude, and in soliciting ftom hea
ven for you, every bluffing which can increafc your <
happincfs here, and hereafter. j

as Gentlemen,
c _ I receive with great frtisfa<ftion the Addreffe* of
e8 the Senate and the House of Representatives of

t These evidences of their effe&ion, and teffimo
r_ niesthat my public services have been ufefal to my
ly country, will ever be dear to me.
rr If yielding to the calls of my fellow-citisens, I
it* have renounced the ease and* enjoyment of private
life, to encounter the dangers and difficulties of the
firft and moll arduous employments, it was becaufe
et the facrifices> on my part, were by them deemed
interefling to their fafety and welfare.âAnimated
by such motives, and supported by the general spi

-0 jeÂ£U of my public agency were attained, nought
(' remained to me but to seek again the private station
r . which their partiality- and confidence required me
for a relinquiih.âln thiVchofen retirement,
the approving voice of my country will ever be a
fubjevt of grateful reeolleftion ; while 1 behold its

. I never wrote a Didionary,; I believe that I
f have no talents for fueh a work, but, were I to
print two folios as ample as Johnson's I could not
[ define the meaning of that impofirg word Patriot
- , Sfiiie Jenyns, one of the few and thinking
; philofophei's of the present time, has remarked a
.. cutely that patriotism is not among the lift of New
| 1 ettament virtues. No wonder that it is hot an

every name vituperative under heaven." 1 have
looked narrowly into the characters and exploits of
fame of the mod noted patriots of ancient and mo
dern times. History and Chefterfield assure us that
the great Brutus was a thief in Macedonia, Attt
cus was a time server, and if the reader will be at
the trouble of confultlng Dalrymple's memoirs he
will find that Lord RufT.l and Alfiernuo,, \Sv j ucy
were hired by France to dothediity work of cor
ruption. Yet these men were called lovers of their
country, and were doubtiefs toasted by many a po
pular club in Rome and London. The year 177 C
produced many Bruti? One has cheated his audi
tors, one has defrauded the public ; theie have been
renegado patriots, and patriots who have capered
at a whipping poll, and dangled from a gibbet.
One may at any time, after an Irifti assize, pick
and choose full grown and athletic-ones from the
goals of Dublin. A patriot is aifurprizing a cha
rafler as the admirable Crichton. He can' do ma
ny and 11 range things. Out of leve to his country
hecan make free with other people's sheep and
goslings ; love to his country loosens the rudder

advise them, when reading the clafficks, to consider
all ancient stories of patriotism, as mere rant,; and

CONGRESS or thk UNITED STATES.
HOUSE or REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, January lj.
The speaker laid before the house a lettei and re- , ,
port from the attorney general on the petition of
Fanny Forfyth, widow of Rribert Forfyth, refp<*cÂ«
ting a lot of land in F-ederickfburg, which had
beenjeonveyed to Gen. Greene, as a counter securi
ty. He recommended a disagreement to the prayer
of the petition. The report was ordered to he
committed to a committee of the whole on Mon
day next.
Mr. Dwight Foster, from the committee of
claims, made reports on the petition* of T'
Currey and Henry Hile. The firft was against th*
petitioner, and conr urred in by the house, the last,
which related to a sum of upwards of nine thou
sand dollars which had been misplaced in the ac
count of the late John Banks and Charles Pettit
with the United States, was referred to a commit
tee of the whole or Monday.
â¢ Mr. Kittera presented a petition from the Illinoio
and Wabafh land aimpanies praying for certain im
munities, which was read, and ordered to be prin
ted, and committed to a fcleit committee of three
members.
Mr. Kittera moved to have the unfinifhed busi
ness pofiponed, in order to take up the report on
the petition of William Alexander, but his moti
on was negatived.
On the motion being about to be put for going in
to a committee of the whole, on the fobjeft of
further revenue.
Mr. Coit' wished the house to take up the reso
lution he had yesterday laid the table.âThe
difference, he said, betwixt this resolution ard the
one reported by the committee of ways and means,
was, that this called for the particulars as thspla",
whilst that called for an agreement to the principle
of diieA taxation without any reference to a plan.
This difficulty, he said, occurred. Many gentle
men objeded to a direst tax, because they oould not
fee their way thro' any plan of carrying it intnef
fedt. He himfelf did not feci this difficulty. He
should vote far the resolution ; because, if a plan
was brought forward which he did not approve, he
should vote against if. It appeared to him, howe
ver, that the house vyould have a more diftintl view
of the fuftjedf, if tpey bad a plan before them.
Mr. Swan wick fairt theobjedHen which he had
to the motion was, that it would embarrass the
queflion whether or not the house wculd agree tÂ»
any system of diredl taxation ? Some gentlemen
thought itJmpoffible to devise a plan for this pur
pose j if could not be expedted therefore that theV committee of ways and means ihnld produce such K,
an Bne as would be wholly unobjefl .onable In m
deed, when he heard it asserted to be impaffibte, he or
trembled for the existence ** our Roremrnant ; for w
it could not exist without revenue, and he could la
not fee ho* that revenue could be ra.fed but by a d,
t*nd rax. The propriety of laying additional bur- h<
then, on commerce h*d been suggested, but, (as ar
he had already stated) this tfocld net probably in- te
crease the revenue, ai it would moll probably pro- at
mote a fpuit of smuggling. Let u. go into a com- w
mittee of the whole an the fabjeft, said Mr. S. p
and let gentlemen bring forward their different
plans, and then the committee will be able to 1)
tetmine which will be molt likely to be effectual, u
and attended with the least inconvenience. There n*
was bÂ»tf one feniiment as to the Heredity of provifi
on being made ; and he was of opinion, if it was Â»
once determined to have a direct tax, such a plan
might be produced as would prove acceptable, when c
gentUmen (hould be convinced that fame plan of P
direct taxation mull be adopted. 1
The speaker said the only motion in order would r
' be, that the committee of the whole on the fubjeft F
of'finance be discharged, in order to refer the pre- <
sent resolution to the committee of ways and
means to inltruft them tp report a plan j or, to 3
commit the resolution o the committee of the
whole on the fubjeft of finance. r
Mr. Harper asked whether it would not be in 1
order, when the house (hould be in a committee of '
the whole, to move the present re(olution by way '
of amendment to ihat reported ? 1
The speaker said the chairman of the commit- 1
tee of the whole would determine thai que:Hun.
Mr Coit moved that the commi tee of the whole '
on the fubjeft of finance, might be discharged from
the further cenfideratioÃ of the fubjeft, for the
purpose of referring his resolution.
Mr. Williams hoped the committee would be
discharged. He wished to have tie plan in quef
tien before them, because if it was not necessary to ;
" prrfo*. it might be necessary at 1
Â« some future day. As to what had been said that
government could not be Supported without aland 1
i tax, he believed other means might be hit up'>n to '
raise the money required without a land tax. Not '
that he would commit himfelf so far as to fay be
might not eventually vote for a land tax. But he '
believed if a small additional duty were to be laid
upon fait and rum, and, fome other artieles, there 1
would be no difficulty in he business.
The speaker reminded Mr. Williams of the
queflion.
Mr Williams said he was Hating hit reasons why i
the fyftem v of direst taxation (hould not now be j
determined upon, because he thought there were j
certain ariiclÂ«s upon which a heavier duty be j
laid ; though he wilhed, at the fame time, to have
the plan of a direst tax broajjht into view, to aft
upon when necessity should require it.
Mr Craik was in favor of the committee of the
whole being discharged, in order that the commit
tee ef Ways and Meant might be inttrufted to report
a plan. He said he was in favor of this proposition,
net so much from any objection.be had to vote for
the resolution as reported, l>ut because if they were
to have i phrv reported, they should lie more likely
to bring the fubjeft to an early conclusion. He
did not think, with some other gentltmen, that by
â voting for that refolution,khe (hould be bound to
*ote foi any plan which might be reported. He
scad no Ifars of this fort; he believed hinsfelf al
ways at liberty to vote as he pleafcd, and to change
hi 3 opinion on any fubjeft when be saw proper.
But, as some gentlemen had expreflcd their objec
tions on this ground, be thought it would be well
to refer this resolution.
Â» Mr. C. fa d, he believed when they confidercd
their real Situation ; that they were not called up
on to determine whether additional revenue (hould
be raised or not, but that revenue mtift by some
means be railed, he trusted that gentlemen would
turn their minds in earned to the fubjeft. 'He be
lieved tffis to be the important bufirefs .ps the ses
sion j and when he looked at the report of the
secretary of the treafuty, he could not hefitatc a
moment in concluding that there was a necessity
foi acting with energy. Seeing, therefore, that
they had no alternative, it becamc their business to
have the fubjeft thoroughly diCcnffed, and to take
a view of both sources, viz. direst and indirect
taxsltort, m upon what fyiicm
they would aft. A resolution, he said, had been
referred to the committee of Ways and Means,
some days ago, calling upon them to report what
' further revenue could be raised by indirect taxes.
It would be well if that committee would brirg in
to view all the ftthjefts upon which indirect taxes
might be raised or increased, in order to enable
them to determine betwixt the two fyflems. It
might perhaps be advifahle to have recpurfe both to
direst and indirect taxation ; for though indirect
means miÂ«ht supply our prefe/it wants, after the
year 1800 they would certainly fall and he
was not for putting off till to morrow what might
fee done to day. It waÂ» nectffaty the attention of
the people (houlil be driven to the fubjeft, and that
government fhouM not he drawn to anticipations
?nd loans, and to give extravagant prices for our
own money.
He believed gentlemen oppefed to direst taxa
tion, were not so much so from principles as from
an idea that it was impoifiblc to adopt a system
which would fall equally upon all parts of the linibn-.
It was to be wished, therefore, that -the plans could
be *en and agreed upon,, since some gentlemen
were apprehensive that by giving their aflent to th c
abftraft proposition, they should pledge thcmfelve,
to support a plan, however objeftienable, when i,
{hould be reported. He hoped, therefore, the re
solution would be referred, and a plan reported.
Mr. W. Smith said it was to be regretted that
the gentleman from Cennpefticut had broOght for
ward this proposition, as it caused them to debate
about form, rather th,an fuhltance. The propÃpo
Ction of the committee of Ways and Means, went
to fay direst taxes (hould be laid ; this directed the
committee to report a bill. He thought it befl to
decide in the firft instance, whether direst taxes
, were neccfiary or not. By bringing the fubjeft
before the committee of th* whole, gentlemen would
have an opportunity of propofinpr their fubftitu'es the
in place ot the plan propped ; and, by contrasting
une with the other, thry should be able to judge
which would prove the belt mode. But gentlemen I
fay no, we will.have the plan in a bill, and if wejj u t
do not like it, we will rrjeft it. He thought the H e
heft way would be to go fairly into the business, dif
and determine whether they would adopt any fyf- i
tem of direst taxation, which could be planned,
and so far pledge (hemfelves, as to deteimine-they j â¬
will agree to any practicable plan which may be j u
produced. _ j (he
Mr. S. said there could only be two objections to i n j
fyltein of direst taxation ; either that by the confti- the
tution there is not a fufltt ient power in the govern- "" e(
ment to raise such a tax, or that it is inexpedient.
If gentlemeii thought there was not fufficient power j
in the constitution to raise such a tax, it (hould be > w ]
so determined ; or, if it were tiioue;ht that mopey i,u
could be raised in a more convenient mode, it was j pl<
proper to discuss the principle, and come to a de
termination on the fubjeÂ£t. 1 hfsÂ» he said was the j.
rational way of proceeding ; for if once the princi-
pie was determined upon tnat a direst tax was ne-
( efTary, a number of objections would be foftened pc
down by the necessity which was seen to exist for ti<
adopting a plan of this kind. (
It had been observed, that a resolution had been w
referred to the committtc of ways and means, in-
ftrufting them to report on the fubjeft of indirect
taxation. He did not object to the reference at
thai time but he had yelterday-declared that tjiat re
repeatedly attempted in vain to hit d;
upon fubjefts of indirect taxation for further reveri- le
ue, and that they had therefore recommended a fyf-
tem of direst taxation.
He hoped thc resolution of thc gentleman from
Connecticut would not be adopted, and that they j,.
(hould go into a committee cf the whole on the p;
bufm.efs. tt
Mr. Nicholas said the question was now wheth ft
er they should determine upon something, or put
it i>ff till another time. We want revenue, said
Mr. N. and we mult have it ; and was it not bet-
ter he asked, to determine Upon what principle they 0
(hould aft, than to call upon the committee of w
ways and means to report a plan. It was well r<
known, he said, nothing but necessity could have Cl
obliged any member to have proposed direst taxes. r '
Unless they firft determined upon the principle,
they (hould never be able to proceed ; because,
however perfect the system might be, objections c
would doubtless be made to it, and these would be
made a pretence for doing away the bill altogether. | c
IHs would have them now go into an investigation P
of the fubjeft ; when the gentleman from New- P
IYork, will of conrfr propose his tax on fait and
rum, and other gentlemen will bring forward their
f substitutes, so that thry should be able to fee, wheth- p
j er any other effeft'UaKmode could be determined
upon in preference to, the one proposed ; if not,
, they would be obliged 10 unite in agreeing to a di
rest tax. But, if they were called upon to decide e
t upon a detailed plan, before they had decided up
on the principle, it would never pass. g
' Mi. Buck said he hoped the committee would <
not be discharged. It seemed to be agreed ton all
hands, when the constitution was adopted, that I
e divert taxes (hould not be iyWjiftto, exceptj in eÂ»-
fes of urguncy and necessity. It seems now to be f
o agreed, that additional revenue was eflemhl. The ;
e fubjeft had been before the committee of ways and
l_ means, whose peculiar province it was to attend to c
all money tranfaftions, and they had reported that t
r ihe peri-id was arrived, wheu it was become necef
,[ faty tÂ» resort to direst taxation. Why, then (hould '
j] [ they (hriuk from the enquiry ? Since tht'y had '
said this was the lime, onlefs it were to be prefum
â d ed they had erred, or members were ready to pro
-3 pcfe some other whi h they think preferable I
j to direst taxes, they ought to pursue the report
le made and take up the business.âTaxes, he said, 1
U were always difagreeab'le, and it was witij icluftance
e the people cbnfeiited to pay any, cxeept they law | J
f. advantage ariling from the payment of thetti great i
lf er than to counterbalance the evil of paying. He i
a knew also that a direst tax would be received !
r with reluctance. He himfelr would never vote for
at it, but upon the principle of necessity. He widi-!
o e4, therefore the fubjeft to be difcufled, because if
ce there wsÂ» any other better wa> of raising the mon- !
ey required, he should vole for it ; but if not, and
m there was an absolute revenue, then
, n necessity would force him to vote for a direst tax.
9j The reason affitmed by the gentleman from New-
York (Mr. Williams) for wishing committee
5 _ to be discharged, v:z. because he thought indirect
n taxes might be found to answer the purpose, indu
cs bed him to wi(h the enquiry to be thoroughly gone
j e into, and that they (hould not amuse themselves
lt by referring the report back to :he committee of
[o ways and means, until they had decided that the
time was arrived for laying a ?treft tax.
Ie Mr. Galiatin said, that altho', in appearance the
le difference between the proposition of the genthman
from -Connecticut (Mr. Coit) and that reported
by the committee so ways and means, waa Only in
at form and not in substance, yet he saw great dÂ»o.
ns er in adopting this proposition. This dang, r
ur would arise, provided there should be a majority in
that House determined to vote against a system of
a _ direst taxation at all events. If there were such a
m majority, he said it would be well to know <it as
m soon as possible, that they might either determine
n upon some other plan of railing revenue, or drter-
U mine to retrench the present expences of govern
,n rneht.
Many gentlemen might vote for the proposition
e c of the gentleman from Connecticut, who would
; 9 eventually be against a system of direst raxes ;
whereas he wifiied at present to know whether there
was a majoritv in favour oraginft that system . if
the majority was against it, it would be well' to
at have it rejected at once.
r - Mr G. said he did not think any gentleman wonld
te be pledged by voting for the report of the committee
o of ways and means, to support any bill which might
nt might be brought in in consequence of it, if eontrarv
,e to h,s ldeas ri E ht - To vote for the resolution, was
to no more tftan to fay, they were willing to adopt the
* system, provided it could be fatisfaftorily carried into
â¢ effect, He hoped, therefore, there would be no more
Â« objedtious on that ground. He also hoped those who
Id intended to vote against diredl taxes, would vote against
the proposition of the irentleraan from -Connc.-lic'tt, "SP
and go into a committee of the when, if they
have a majority with them, they will-vote out the pro
position altogether. s
He would not then, he said, fay any thing on th* -j
fubjeil of direst taxation, as it would not be in order â¢
He hoped the committee of theÂ»whole would not be "
discharged. " a
Mr. Craik said the gentleman from South-Carolina Â°Â» 1
(Mr. W. Smith) railed this a question of principle, 1
He agreed it was so ; but he thought the measure pro- Mo
posed by the gentleman from Connecticut, would pro- pl ar
duce the efFed! si much wiflied for. He believed he
Ihould be fpund to go as far as any gentleman in adopt
ing efficient nKtfuies for raising revenue , but he
thought.the mod; jf proceeding (Chalked out by the me j
refalution now proposed the best. He did not ronfi
der it as improptr to to d>re& taxes,
: whilst there were any sources of indirect tixation ex-|
1 iftiag There might be fubjeiSs of indiredl taxation |l w 1
! which it would be improper at present to resort to; one
but his objeflion 10 deciding upon the prtnei- the t
1 pie was this, that many members had greater objee- the
1 tions to the bufincfson account of the difficulty which
they supposed would attend the carrying of it into ef- j
feiSl, tlran to the principle itfelf. And it in vain
to tell gentlemen they might vote againfl the bill, if ?
they did no' like it, because they knew it was in the
potVer of a majority to carry the bill, however objec- â¢
tionalile, into effect. I
Th- question for discharging the committee of tne ;
whole was put and negatived.
Mr. Harper said he was not moredifpofed than other '
members of that House, to throw any obstacles in the I
way of providing revenue ; nor of unneceflarily post
poning a bulinefs with a view Â«f defeating it by indi- I '
re<Jl methods. But he believed tisei e was always more
danger to be apprehended from hasty, than from flow !
legislation. Large bodies like theirs, he said, fuffered I ,
more from precipitation than from delay. If this ob- j
Tervation was true, as it refpedled ordinary legislative I j
bulinefs, it was much more so as it refpe&ed finance,
and new objects of financeâmeafures which were to I
have an extensive operation on the prosperity ar.d hap- I 1
pinefs of the country. He was one of those who I '
thought that a certain portion of time devoted to this I
would have been well spent ; as the house, I 1
however, had been of the fame sentiment, but had 1 t
determined te come to a decision upon the abitrail I (
principle, he should do, what gentlemen had been cal- I
led upon several times to do, viz. submit to the view I
of the honfe, a 431'opofitiou by which all the revenue I
which government Hands in need of, without having j
recourfeto the tax on land and llaves, proposed by the I
committee of ways and means, might with ease be I
raised.
Mr. H. then proposed the following resolution to I
the houleâ I 'j
" Resolved that the duty now paid on fait be in- 1 0
creased cents per bushel,
" That the duty on that class of wares and m#r-| ca
chandize imported from foreign countries, which now I
pays 10 per cent, ad valorem be augmented to
percent. I
K That the duty on such merchandize as pays 12$ I
per cent, be augmented to per cent. I
" That the duty 011 such merchandize as pays 15 I
per rent, be augmented to per cent. I P'
" That the duty on Madeira wine beÂ» augmented I
per cent , on the present duty. I â 
" That the duty on Sherry, Lifcon andtertain ud
enumerated wines be augmented per cent', on I
tke present duty. i I a'
" That the duty on foreign spirits not diftil'ed fron. I
grain, be augmented per cent, on the present I â 
duty.
1 " That the duty on Bohea tea, be augmented
per cent, on the piefent duty.
a _ " Thai the duty on brown sugar be augmented
per pound.
" Thiit thefum of be raised by a duty on |
Ramps. I
' " That the sum of be rzifedby a tax on win I J
1 dows, by apportionment according to conftituliona! I
t rules amongst the different states."
Mr. Gallatin enquired whether there was not a refo I n
I lution referred to the committee of ways and means t<> I a
. the fame effecfl by a gentleman from New-Je.fey (Mr. I
Henderfon.)
Mr. W. Smith read that refolÂ«liÂ«n.
Mr. Venahle fuegefled the propriety of referring | "
s this resolution to the committre of ways and means. I v
t Mr. VV. Smith Wished rather that the resolution j n
should be committed to the committee of the whole ? I '
* the committee of ways and means, hp' said, had al-1 v
ready determined that fuflicient revenue conld not be 1
v I raised from indiref) sources. He wished the sense oN
| the committre of the whole to be taken on the.f*bje<S. j
e 1 The refoiution was referred to thecommictee of the |
d j whole.
r j The House then resolved itfelf into a comrrittee (
- of the whole, on the fubjeft, Mr. Dent in the chair, c
if when f (
; Mr. Cnoper Oiid the business before the commit" f
J tee was of so impjitawt a nature, as to call npon 0
every gentleman to declare his sentiments freely on !
'â  the fttbjeft, diredl taxes, he laid, had always been
confidend as only to be juftified in times Â»f necefli- f
:e f y, This was hir opinion. This being the con- v
fttuftion, it became a qneftion whether we were 1 <.
now in tbat situation, whether we can ftipport the
e expenees of *overnment ; whether we can pay the -
:s interest and principal Â»f our debt ; whether we can
meet the ; whether we can keep
e up our foreign intercourse ; whether we ean in
short, support the honor and chara&er of the Uni- '
e ted States, without having reaoufe, to this method ,
n Â»f taxation. If we could do this, hÂ« said, then j
d this mode should be left unexplored till the worst j '
B of times. ! 1
: Mr. C said he had no expeflation that a dirett
j tax on land would meet with the general approba-
J tion ef the citiz;ns of the United States. It did â¢
a I not meet with his; but, perhaps interest, he said, j
j mighl influence him, since it would bring the whole ]
los his property tinder a tax. He (Tumid, however, (
vote for the resolution. He should do 'so because 1
he thought eur commerce already fufficiently shack- '
led, ard because our citizens had had no experience I
in window taxes and (tamp duties, and therefore
would not relilh tli^m; and more efpeeially be>-
cause in times like the present, when all Europe
' was at war, it was more difficult to support our
jj- neutrality and honor aa a nation, than in times of
peace.
j This being the cafe, Mr. C. said, he was desirous
Id to do all in his potfer to secure an ample and fub
ec ftantial revenue, in order to enable us to meet our
ht engagements with punctuality ; because it was with
r y governments as with families, when want approach
ed, they were apt to senfure each other as a cause
(o of the evil. This had always been the cafe. The
ire only remedy, he said, was to make provision before
ho band ; to keep oil in onr lamp, in order to feÂ« our
all way en every iide.

AN ENQJJI R Y
Concerning Political Justice,
And its Influence on Morals and Happiness,
By William GqnwiN.
THE reputation of th; work is already well efia^
blifned in Europeâlt is hardly neteiTary for an Ame->
rican editor to ijy more than barely to mention, that
the Enquiry concerning Political Justice has ever
since its publication been a favorite performance w*tu
the friends of republican government. The lii'e is
pure, nervous, and classical; the Ideis are ftcoiiKly 1
marked by an original vein of thinking ; and, anion .it
a multitude of other just and ftrikiug pillages, the
author's delineation of the peculiar infelicities inftpa
rable from the condition ot a King, raay be pointed
out as a mod mafteriy specimen of philofopliical d.f
qtiifition. The latest London edition of .his work
fells in this city at four dollars and an half.

Porcupine's Gazette. 8
Proposals by WILLIAM COBBETT, opposite Chtift
Church, Philadelphia, for pubiilhing a lidw.-paoer,
to be entitled 1
Porcupine's Gazette, Daily Advertiser.
Methinks 1 hear the reader exclaim ; " What! have
we not Gazettes enough already ?" Yes, ,md far tao
many : but thole that we have', are, in general, "con
ducted in such a manner that their great number, irf- '
Itead ot rendering i.iine unnecessary, i, the only cause
that calls for its eftablifliment.
T he gazettes in this country have done it more real in
jury than all its open enemies ever did or can do. They
mjflead the people at home and ihifreprefent theiji a
btoad. It was these vehicles of sedition and difcortl
that encouraged the counties in the Weft to rebel ; it
was they that gave i ife to the depredations of Britain,
by exciting the people to such aft.; of violence against
lljat nation, as left no room to dsubt that we were de
termined on war ; and it was they, when an accent- J
I modation had been happily effected, that flirred up an
opposition to it such as has seldom bten wiuefled, and
whieh was-oveicome by mere chance. These gazettes
it was, that, by mifrcprelenting the difpofitioi.s of the
pc irl.*j encflairjigad the Fi ein jt -to -pn cccd from one
degree of infulenceto another, 'till at last their Minis
ter braves the President in his chair, aad a bullying
commander comes and tells us that his only bulinets is
to seize our veliels, in violation of a treaty, in virtue
ot wiuch alone lie claims aright to enter our ports : and
it is these gazettes that now have the impudence to t'e
fend what their falfehood and malice have produced.
I lhail be told that the people are to blame ; that
they are not obliged to rea.i thefe> abominable publica
tions. But they do read them ; and thoufsnds who
readthein, read n.Sthing else. To suppress them is nn
polTjbie ; they will vomit forth their poison ; it i,Â» a pri
vilege of their natures, that no law Ift abridge ; and
therefore the only mode left is, to eouiiteradt its efu cts.
-This inuft be done, too, in theirown way. Books,
or periodical publications in the form of books, iii.iy
be of fomc lervice, but are by no means a match for '
their flying folios. A falfebood that remains uncontra
dicted for a month, begins to be looked upon as a truth,
and when the dete&ion at last makes its appearance, it
is often as useless a that ef the dodtor who finds his
patient expired. The only mcthodiof opposition, then,
is to niat;t them on their own ground ; to let foot to
foot ; dispute every inch and every hair's breadth;
fight them at their own weapons, and return them two
blows for one- i
A gazette of this stamp is what I have long wished to
fee, but I have wished and sxueifted it in vain. Indig
nation at the fupiiienefi of otilers has at last Â£ot the
better of all diffidence in my own capacity, and has de
termined me to encounter the talk People have heard
one fide long enough ; thÂ»y shall now hear the other.
CONDITIONS.
1. Porcupine's Gazette shall be of the usual size,
and the fubfeription Eight Dollars a year, to be paid at
