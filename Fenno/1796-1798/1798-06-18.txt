HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Saturd'ay, May 26.
(undry refolutionsrrom
Charles County, Maryland, exprelfiveof their
approbation of Government, and pledging
themselves to support its future measures.
.The bill supplementary to an act for the
relief of persons imprisoned for debt, and the
bill for providing relief for persons imprison
ed for debt due to the United States, were
read the third time apd paired.
Mr. Sewall called for the order of the
day on the bill from the Senate for the more
effectual protection of the Commerce and
Coaftsof the United States ; and the house ac
cording resolved itfelf into a committee of the
whole on the said bill, Mr. Dent in the chair.
The bill having been read,
Mr. Macon rose and observed, that he
wished to amend bill and the pream
â  ble to it, and de(ired the Chairman to fay
which it would be in order to move firft. The
Chairman having anlwered that it would be
molt regularfirft to amend the bill, and then
the preamble could be made coniormable to
it, Mr. Macon moved to strike out the word
44 such," in the enacting clause (the etfeft of
which was to make the informations given to
the Commanders of our Vellels general againlt
all cruizers, as well as against the French.)
His reason for making this motion was, that
; if this bill must pals, it might be general
; against all Nations who commit depredations
upon our commerce, for it was a fait well
known that France is not the only Nation
which does this. It was his opinion, that be
fore any measure of this kind was taken, we
ought to know the result Of our million in
France ; for, however flenderour expectati
ons of an accommodation may be, (till those
expectations ought not to be abandoned, un
til we arc certain our Commillioners have left
Paris, without being able to accomplish their
mi (lion.
Mr. M. believed, it could not be doubted
by any one that if we had thought a ttate of
war, preferable to the itate in which we had
been placed forfome rime back, we had had
fufficient provocation from more than one Na
tion to have declared war long ago. Indeed he
looked upon this bill as a declaration of war in
iubftance ; he saw that this was the situation
to which measures was progrefling, but he
could not have expe&ed that gentlemen
would have proposed a measure of this kind
whilst our Commillioners were yet in Paris.
It was his opinion, however, that difagreeablg
as our present lituation may be, it is nui(;h pre
ferable to a (tate of war ; for notwithstanding
all the lofTes which our merchants have sus
tained, our trade and our revenue are conti
nually increasing.
In the part of the country from whence he
came, Mr. M. said, the price of produce is
now higher than it has been for lome time
past. But in cafe of war, it would fall of
course.
Notwithstanding all the evils wliich he was
sensible mult attend on aftateof war, when he
found our Comnnftioners had left France, and
no hope ofaccommodation remained, helhould
not hesitate to join gentlemen inany measures
which shall be necellary to meet a Itate of war.
Mr. Harper could not 'help being surpri
zed at the motives which the gentleman from
N. Carolina fa ; d had induced him to make
this motion. Gentlemen had heretofore said,
they were unwilling to take any active mea
sures against france until Negociation was
exhausted; now though they contefs that they
have no hope from Negociation, they are un
willing to do any thing against France, until
our Commiflioners come home. Yet the gen
ileman from N. Carolina willies to make this
bill general, and though he inlrfts upon its be
ing a declaration of war, he deifres it may not
be levelled at France only ; but at England
and Spain, to whom no renionltrance for their
depredations has been made, and with whom
no attempt has beeh made at negociation. Is j
it not astonishing that men who have always
exprefed themselves in favour ot peace,
fliould be able to get their consent to argu
ments which give the lie to all their former
declarations ; that they should objeft to a
measure, because they deem it a war measure
with one Nation, and (till be willing to em
brace it when it is made to apply to three
Nations. If gentlemen are thus blinded by
their paflionsin favour of some Nations, and
against others, he could only deplore that
blindness. If, 1 with their eyes open, they can
rulh into the measure proposed, and yet de
cline it when confined only to one Nation, he
left it to themselves to reconcile the inconsis
tency. And yet these gentlemen are continu
ally loading those who wish to take spirited
measures of defence, with the mod odious
epithets, as being friendly to war. He could
account for this inconsistency ot conduct only
from the violent antipathies and attachments
which he had already mentioned, which fee
mcd effectually to blin:! gentlemen as to what
respeCt the true interests of their own coun
try.
Mr. M'Dowe LLfaid, the gentleman from
S. Carolina had dwelt much upon the incon
sistency of the present potion. He himfelf
colud not fee any in it. He had insinuated
that the mover and seconder of it must be
blined by prejudice and governedby paifion ;
that instead of going to war with one nation
it would be going to war with three, and
that before we remonstrate with them, or re
quest them to desist from their practices ;
that we have been attempting to get redress
from France for eighteen months past without
effect, but that no attempt has been made to
negociate with England or Spain oh the sub
ject of their depredations. Ir. this the gentle
man from S. Carolina was certainly mistaken.
He knew we had lately concluded a treaty
with England, which had b?#n conftaiitly
violated; and what faith Mr. M'D. asked,
could be placed in a Nation which one day
a treaty, and the next violates it ? The
fame remark would apply to Spain, so far as
they have depredated upon our commerce.
Mr. M'D. said, he had all along declared
himfelf opposed to war, or to any measures
which would lead to it, and he (till held the
fame opinion. He had no prejudice against or
in favour of any Nation whatever, except so
far as their conduct towards thft country was
hie nelly or otherwise ; and he could fee-no
reason sot giving inductions to the Comman
ders of our vellels to seize and brfng in the
vessels of otic country which may ctnnmit de
predations upon otir commerce, and not those
of smother. He was hirr.felf opposed to the
bill altogether ; but if it must pals, hewilhed
to make it contain as little mifchief as pofti
ble, Â«nd he thought by striking out the word
" such," and by that means nuking it gene
ral, France could not take the fame offence
at it; jis the bill now tiood, it was tantamount
to a declaration ot war.
Mr. J. W1 ll.iams was in hopes when the
gentleman from N. Carolina firft made n\smo
tion, rjiat the opposition which he had here
tofore (How 11 was done away, and that the bill
was only objected to becau e it was not gene
ral ; but now it appeared that gentlemen are
opposed to the bill altogether. He had hop
ed when gentlemen had reflected upon wlut
had taken place, even within our own jurif
dict:on, that there would rot have been a tin
gle diirenting voice in the committee. Gen
tlemen alledge that this will lead to
war ; but he would alk whether other Neu
tral Nations had not taken measures fully as
ftrongasthis; without producing war I For
his part, he supposed it might have been bet
ter if this country had gone into this system
of defending our commerce. He wasoppofed
to it'for a eonfiderable time. He was in hopes
of areconciliation taking place ; but he had
been deceived from time to time, and instead
of any appearance of accommodation, every
day brought information which coimnced
him, that, except we meant to fubniit alto
-1 gether, we must defend ourselves. This be
ing ttoe cafe, he alked gentlemen which they
I would chufe) Whether they would futier
| themselves to come under the power Â®t 4he
French Nation, or repel forCc by fÂ«rce t He
i did not believe any gentleman would fay we
' oughttiot to embrace the latter* .
At a time when the enemy's veflels are
within our own jurisdiction, are we to with
hold the necellary instructions to the com
manders of our vessels f He hoped not. Not
that he Would go hastily into war ; but have
we not, he a(ked, been in war for a long time Â»
A war on one lide, and tutal fuhnviTiion on
the other. Yet the house are now,called up
j on to postpone the <tenfideraiion of this ques
tion, left it Ihould produce war. The only
! way to prevent a war, he believed, was to be
prepared to meet it. If spirited measures had
been taken during the extraordinary feflion of
Congress, he believed it might have prevent
ed the loss of property to the amount qf
twenty millions of and the neceflity
of a war. But Congress lUd gone on from
time to time, faying we will'wait (6r this, that
and the other, and it w ill, in all probability,
prevent war. This conduit had produced
the greatest difficulties, and yet gentlemen
wish to go further in the fime course. The
enemy's vessels, he tinderftood are within the
Capes, and he fuppafed gentlemen would
wait till they came up to the city before they
i would take any means to oppose them. He
! believed it wgs high time, to fay " we will
j not submit," and to prepare to rrpel the re
peated aggressions of our enemy. But gentle
men fay, " No, we will oppose the bill alto
. gether." Let us, said Mr. W. pass this bill
as it is, and if gentlemen chufe to bring for
i ward another bill against any other nation, he
(hould not object to it, if they refilled to do
;us justice. He was not in favour of one nati
on more than another ; he would relist op
pression from all. This bill, he believed
ought to be p.affed immediately.. Ifjt had
been pafled a *keek ago, it \Vould have saved
to the United States a large Ann of money.
Mr. Shepard observed, that much had
been said on thit bill, and on the refelutionis
011 the fjme fubjeft, which were referred to
the fime committee. Members differed ih
opinion very materially as to the proper mode
of conducting our affairs at this important
crisis ; blithe could fie no reSfon for defer
ring vigorous measures anv longer, as he did
not fee the least ground of hope-os a reconci
liation, it was therefore idle to diipute about
it.
He Would ask gentlemen so violently o"ppo
fed to th ; s bill, what they would do ? Ars
they willing to fend more envoys to rhfc
French nation, to sue for an accommodation ?
He supposed not; every thing which can be
done, has been done to effect an accommo
dation. Are gentlemen ready, then, to
give the money which had been demanded Â»
He presumed not. He hoped gfentlemen
pofleffed l to much American blood to
to any such thing ; wid (f so, why do they he
sitate to take the measure proposed, and en
deavour to throw embarrassments in the Way
of every measure of defence which Can be
taken. Ifweareto purchase peace, let ui
doit; if not, let us defend ourselves like
men. Or do gentlemen wish to wait until
more injuries, and more insults are added to
hose already received, before any step of de
fence must be taken, left it should lead to
war ! Will a conduct like this save America i
No ; it will not.
But "gentlemen decline taking this measure
because they are apprelienfive it will irritate
the French nation. Mr. S. believed this
country could do nothing to .alter thÂ« conduct
ot the French nation towards us, Â«;cctpt it
were by giving them money. There could
be no doubt, lie said, but the French meant
to subjugate this government, and to lay the
United States inder contribution. Every
news paper told them this, yet some gentle
men seem opposed toevery thing intended to
refill their doing-, or even to tell them they
have done wrong. For his part, lie believed
that nation had been boiling over with mad
nefo for two years past, and that they are to
tally void of every virtue.
They have told us, said Mr. S. in plain
terms, they mean to subjugate us. They fay
they have a strong party in this country, and
that they understand diplomatic agency as
well as any other nation. This he believed,
as he faw-they had effectually tifed that pow
er in fnbduing every country ih Europe that
they -have any thing to do with, except
Great Britain, and he feared they would suc
ceed against her. No man, M. S. said, dislik
ed war more /han him ; but he believed the
belt way of preserving ourselves from it was
to take measures to oppose a power which has
so nnjuftly treated us. We ought ndf, he
said, to trifle any longer, but take new ground.
The more insults we submit to, the more we
(hall have. He could not suppose gentlemen
would be willing to wait till all our vessels are
taken and our government overcome, before
they will make resistance. If we meant to
preserve our independence, he believed felift
ance ought now to be made. It is time, said
he, to telt the French nation, "we will not
submit any longer." This was the way we
gained our independence, ami this must be the
way by which we must keep it. He hoped,
therefore, the bill would pais as it (lands.
Mr. Oris said, though he had fufticient
confidence in the committee to induce him to
believe that the present motion cannot (tic- '
ceed, yet he could not forbear to expostulate
with gentlemen on the impropriety of any
measures which fliould have a tendency to
give unneceflary offence to tfther nations be
lides that againii which we are called upon to
aft. To increase our foes would only be to
aggravate otir misfortunes. Mr. O. hoped
and believed this country would be able to
defend itMf singly and alone j but litppoCng
as gentlemen agree to be true, that we are on
the eve of a war, would it not be highly impo
litic to irritate a power whose alfiftance we
may find very acceptable in the course of a
few months again!) a common enemy >
hoped itw#uld never be neceti'ary to seek tor
11) sa.liftancc, though it ispoflible, it we arc
driven into war witn our old friends, that we
may willingly avail ourselves of the aid ofour
old enemies forthoughwe had flittered in
juries from more nations than one, yet he a
greed with our envoys in thelentitnent that if
France fliould attack us we must seek the belt
means of defence", and may find it more pru
dent to forgive than to provoke by harsh mea
fnres, a nation which may aid in our defence.
Mr. O. said, if alter injuries had been cont
mitied againfi us by Great Britain and Spain,
of the fame nature with those which liirve
been heaped upon us by France, and thofc na
tions like her, had refufed to hear us or to do
usjuftice, he'would support the faine mea
fnres againfi them and vindicate our national
character and honour. But though he should
by 110 means attempt toextenuaie the conduct
of Great Britain or Spain, lie believed lie
might fay that the depredations committed
by these powers subsequent to their treaties,
have been under colour at leaflof
nations. But the difference in the degrees
of these depredations in comparison with those
of the French republic, cannot be better as
certained than by thj rates of insurance paid
as a security againfi tiiein refpeftively.
Insurance may. be effected against the Bpi
nifli and Britifli for si epercent. whilst it can
j not be procured againfi the French for less
than 25 or 30 per cent. And though the
| British cruizers do, in some cases, take our
1 vefTels, in others they afford them protection,
j Indeed, he believed, the number of our vef
| fels rescued front the fangs of the French,
andreftored to us, by the Bririfh, greatly ex
ceeded in value the amount ot those which
1 have been taken from 11s by them since their
treaty. They have saved to Philadelphia a
bout half a million of dollars. With refpeil
to Spain, he believed her disposition towards
us to be friendly, and that any injury offered
by them to us was done at the instigation of
another country. Again we have received
under the la'e treaty with Great Britain
ioo,oool. sterling soT damages sustained by her
i depredations, and from Spain 300,000 dollars
hjive been awarded on the fame account. So
that no comparison could poflibly be made
betwixt the treatment we experienced from
France and those countries. She makes no
treatiesâShe pays no compensations.
The amendment is proposed, with a design
to hold up to the people the idea, that if we
were at war with France, we cannot calculate
to receive afliftance from any other country
having catife of complaint against all parties.
Gentlemen were certainly accountable to
themselves for their own conduit and modes
of expression, and doubtless think they ail
with discretion; but he believed that when
the warmth ot the present feflion and the ar
dour of debate should subside they would be
persuaded I hat cpmparifons such as they had
matte were not pertinent or judicious. Mr.
O. said, it whnld be recollected that gentle
men had acknowledged, that if this amend
ment was adopted, they should (till vote a
gaipft the bill. It' Great Britain and Spain
have injured us, the proper mode of proceed
ing, was firll to endeavour to obtain redress ;
and it that is not allowed, it will be time
enough to use force ; but with refpeel to the
French Republic, every kind of application
has beenexhaufted. There can be nuquef.iou
about war, the only way was to confiderhow
we fliould get an honorable peace. They
have made war upon us, and he believed we
should be more likely to obtain peace, by a
fpirrted conduct, than by base fubmiflion.
Mr. Kittera role to'obferve, that gn'e of
the articles in our treaties with Great Britain
and Spam, flipulates that 110 reprisals (hall be
authorized by either country until application
(hall be made to the other, which he thought
would be a fufficient reason for negativing ilie
amendment. He believed it would be proper
to adopt an additional rule to those already
efiablilhed for the government of the houle,
viz. that when French privateers came with
in our own ports and take our veflels, a long
debate shall not take place upon a bill to iu
ftruft the commanders of our veffcls to make
reprisals.
Mr. Gallatin in reply to the last olifer
vation of Mr. K. said, that if his assertion
was true that French privateers were commit
ting depredations within our own ports, orany
where within our jurisdiction, it was no rea
son why this bill fliould pais
for withoiff the bin, the President had full
power to apply the armrd veffcls, or any other
force at his dil'pofal, in repelling the outrage.
As to the amendment he would not pretend to
lay that it was very ell'er.tial ; but he suppo
sed the reason for moving it was this.
It was alferted that this bill was not a de
claration of war, but only a kind of special
reprisal author;fed by the law of nations, it
was therefore tlvnight it would be proper to
make it a general regulation. If it was in
tended to be a declaration of war, it would
be extremely wrong to make two enemies,
instead of one. If it was to be passed with
that intention, it would be wrong to adopt
the amendment; but he supposed it was in
troduced on the ground assumed by the sup
porters of the bill that the measures proposed
might be entered into without.violating the
laws of nations, and confidently with a (late
of peace.
In relation to the opposition which had been
given to the various war raeafures which had
been brought forward in the course of the
feflion, it was in the power of gentlemen to
have prevented the greater part of it, if, in
stead of going on step by ffep, the whole fyf.
tem which they had in vie* had been laid be
fore the house at once, only one debate would
have taken place on the propriety or-policy of
placing the country in a date of war. After
that had been determined, the other mealures
which mutt have followed in course would
have bjeen adopted without much debate ;
Wcaufe after tke country fliall bÂ» declared to
\} T OLVMf. XIII.
be in a (late of war, it will be the duty of
every member to make it as effectual as he is
able, and as hurtful to the enemy as it can be
made; but To long as the country is declared
not to be in a (late of war, it is natural for iliefe
members who are ovpoled to war, 10 endea
vour-to prevent mealures leading to that (late
or inconfident with a date of peace ; but, if
war is once declared/ he would take upou
himfelf to fay no longer opposition would be
given to either dÂ«. c enfive or otfenfive prepara
tions.
Mr. G. wished the committee had also
made a report upon the rcfolution on this
subjeCt lately referred to them by the house
which tltey lay they had not time to consider ;
and not that the house Ihould have this b: 11
to-day, another to-morrow, and so on, for
if it tpe intended at all everits to get into war,
the more effectual the measures are which
(hall be taken, the belter. He would at once
concur in this bill, or any one which Ihould
go farther, whenever the country lhall have
be;n declared to be in a (late of war.
All that had been said for the postponement
of this quedion, and againlt it, arole trom the
aitferent opinions entertained as to the pofli
bility of ao accommodation with France. He
owned his hopes on this subject are very (len
der ; but there is one (tubborn fact againlt
any hollile measures at present, the .negotia
tion is itill open, and .jur Coiiiinillijiici. are
(till in Paris ; and whiiA this continued to be
the cafe, although he was not able to account
for tlteir.remaining there, lie would continue
to vote againlt any mealures inconliden. with
a (late of negociution.
On the other hand, when gentlemen fay
this measure s not war (though he believed
the contrary) but authorized by the laws of
nations, the gentleman from North Carolina
came forward with his amendment, and laid,
if this is one of thole things which nations may
do confident with their neutrality, let us make
it general ; for the muntent you take meafiire*
ola holiilt nature againlt one of the belligerent
powers, and not againlt another, it would not
be fuflicient fur us to fay that one of them hat
Committed more depredations upon us than
another, though this would be a good teafon
for going to war, with one nation more than
the other. Mr. G. wished, therefore, if this
was intended as a war measure (and he had no
doubt of its beiag so) that it might be clearly
exprefTed, as then every effectual measure
might be taken for furthering war prepara
tions, and every oppolition vfrould hereafter
cease.
Mr. Hartley said, the opposition made
to this bill was very extraordinary. As to a
declaration of war, he did not think such a
measure could be proper whilst our Commilfi
eners remain in Paris j but for more than.a
week pad he was convinced France would
have war with this country, he therefore wish
ed to go into every measure of defence both
of our commerce and territory. Gentlemen,
notwithdanding, they mud fee that France is
aiming at universal dominion, wish to put off
measures of defence from one period to ano
ther. He thought we ought no longer to heâ
sitate, but to go as far as poffihle in the pro
tection of our commerce; for he did not think:
we had any thing to fear from the mighty na~
lion. A body of a few tlioufand men would
secure us in the fouthcrn dates, and we had
nothing to fearin theealtern ornothern (fatey
He hoped, therefore, this amendment would
be negatived, and the bill palled, without
farther ebjeftion.
Mr. Edmond supposed that the minds of
gentlemenwereprettv generally determinedim
this quedion, and he could not therefore hope
to effect any change of opinion in any mem
ber of the committee, yet he hoped he Ihould
be jull.fied, in a question of so much impor
tance, in taking up a little time of the com
mittee, in delivering his lenriments upon it.
He role in opposition to the present amende
nient. It was said, this is either a peace mea
sure, or a war measure. If it is confident with
a (late of peace, it was argued that there could
be no danger in extending it to other Nations
as well as to the French. Heconlidered it as
a peace measure ; but bifore the committee
agree to the proposed amendment, they ought
to conlider the consequences of c'oing so.
lfoneofour merchant velfclj' (houla be
depredated upon by a Uritifli ora Spanifti (hip
of war, it could not be. war, but a breach of
our treaties with these powers which stipulate
that complaint of any injury received, (hall
fird be made, and fatisfaclion demanded, be
fore any act of reprisal) fliall be authorised.
But with respeCt to Frakce, admitting that we
have (he fame treaty vtffli her, how does the
fad dand f With refpecf to Great Britain and
Spain, it is (bpuiated that retlreft (hall in the
tirft place he asked. This had repeatedly been
done wifhrefpeCt to France. We have fre
quently made an application there in the lan
guage of supplication. Do France and Great
Britain, then Hand upon the fame footing*
No; they dand upon diffc/ent ground, and
the fame rule of conduct will not apply ti>
them.
Another idea has been fuggeded, riz. that
the bill should be general, lelt it (hould dii
pleaie France, and impede our Negociation
with that country. If there was the niofl dis
tant hope of an honourable settlement of our
differences with that country, lie fliouid be as
unwilling as any man to (top or impede the
business; but when he reflected upon what
had paired between the two countries front
the commencement of our Independence to
the present time, that hope was lellened, if it
everexifted. When he saw, that inllead of
friend (hip, (he had Ihewn quite a contrary con
duct towards us, he doubted whether that
friendlhip ever e.vilfed. When he found that
on the 9th of May, 1793, (he undertook to
pass a decree to take out of all neutrals veirels
enemy's goods, in violation of her treaty with
us, but that upon remxnilratuig with her, (he
undertook to repeat it on the ajd ; but w'hen
(he had blinded the eyes of our commercial
people by this repeal, die fat down five days
after, and repealed her last decree. When he
saw this he InfpeCled the hatred of France in
dead of its friendlhip. Another application
was made on the fubieCl, and on the id #f J u _
ly, theoffenfive decree is again repealed, this
repeal' contined till the aÂ«th of the 'fame
month, when if was again rescinded.
Try the conduct of France farther, and how
does it appear? When we look at the depre
dations which have been Committed upon our
commerce; when we l*e the manner in which
our veflels had been tal.eti upon pretences of
certain papers being wanting of which our
matters an t owners of velfels were ignorant.
What would luve befii a friendly conduct m
fu*tÂ» cafesi Would it nave !j : etÂ» to take jti-vantage of inadvertence and ignorance * Crr
tair.ly not. Or it" we V.i lite c\m4\ist of
their Minister in this country. He comes to
cultivate harmony { but when we fee him en
deavouring re ra.fe up the peopleagamrt their
Government, it cannot be taken as a friend
ly proceeding.
\lr. ft. wuhedfome gentleman would un
dertake to'!h-w the marks ofthis friendfh'p of
France of which so much had been heard.
What has been done on our part ? After re- i
reiving repeated injuries, we have appointed
Coinnii(liÂ»iiers after CpmmiQSoners to treat
with them. Our reward is known. He did
not vrifh to aggravate the conduct of France ;
but he wished to know how long gentlemen
would be willing to lie,at her foot (tool ? Was
it proper to continue our Negooation with a
power which is the Ocean of all our
vefleis f Suppose our CommiHion;rs are in
Paris, endeavouring to negotiate, how comes
it that the privateers of France are not re-call
ed, instead of being fufterct to mfeft our
coafta ? Rot instead of thi< their disposition is
shewn by their decree of the nth of January,
which determines the character ot veflels by
their cargo.
All thefc afts, Mr. E. said, demonftra'ed
the temper and disposition of that Republic
towards America. He thought it perfectly
idle sot* our Com in ifli oners ro remain at Pans
stating complaints, and writing vindications,
without the least hope of success. What will
the Directory fay to them i They will (ay,
you set tip your claims, but how will you
ertfOrce tlwrm f You cannot get a vote to lay
your luivlupon any of our privateers upon
your co.*(t; you coiue on an idle errand.
Congress have no idea that your country has
any I ich claims; if they believed it, they
wÂ«uld fupporr them." When the French find
its a feeble and ciivied Nation, will they listen
tora moment ro the suppliant and feeble pray
er of our Commt (doners > No; they wtll con
tinue their war upon our commerce, and raise
a tribute upon us when they please, and when
they hate accoiupl.fhed their part with Groat
Britain, they will then treat with us. We
{hall then be called upon to buy a peace upon
ttteur own terms. He acknowledged they had
overpowered many Nations, and made peace
with them, at various prices ; hut the peace
which they aredifpofingof is of French manu
facture; it may be brilliant, but not durable.
He wished rtor to purchase such a peace. He
would, on the contrary, now adopt spirited
measures, and convince France that we -ire
not to be tr fled with any longer. Or, if Â£en- j
fleinen wifti us o appear so degraded, so re
duced and humbled a Nation, as to be ready j
to receive the boon we can beg from them, j
then it will be right to continue our Applica
tion. But, if that is not their idea; if they
cotfceixe that we have rights founded in jus
tice, which otigh&o beiupported, will they
not beperfuaded that we (hall be more likely
to have them refpiCted, by taking a spirited,
inanly course of conduct, than Uie contrary ?
They certainly mull. '
For hi.ufclfj Mr. E. said, were he sent to
treat with Francea period like the present,
and that Nation were to tell him that one half
his countrymen disavowed the claims which
he set up, if these were any truth for the re
mark, he ihould think he might as well at
tempt to. negoci.ite upon his own authority*
as in behalf of Government. It, said he, we
rlo not mean to lie upon our oars, let us come '
forward and support the claims of our Com
missioners, and tiien there will be (ome proba
bility of rher being fuccefsful. Without
this, our Commillioners will never be able to
acconiplifh any thing, and the French would
continue their depredations upon our trade.
But if we adopt the measure proposed, are we
about to declare war ? Certainly not. If, said j
he, I a-n attacked by an individual, yd resist
iiim, and in doing so, I break or talcs. from
himhis fword,dold*clare waragainft him? No*
common fcnle, and the firt principles of felf*
defence fiy that rhis is right. And will not the
fame reasoning apply to Nations ? He said,
it certainly would. The measure now propo- ;
fed, goes no farther than to-arrefl the sword !
from*he hmd of our enemy, aiul to keep it |
foronr own fec-irity ; until our diTpute is '
fettled. He hoped, therefore, the amendment
would be disagreed ro.
Mr. Lyon could not diicover why gentle
men fbould be opposed to this amendment,
if they did not suppose the bill under conside
ration would amount to a declaration of war.
It was his opinion it would have that effect, I
and therefore he wa> opposed to it. He hoped j
our Negociation in Paris was not yet doled ; |
but if this bill paff'es, his hopes ot peace would !
be at an end. The gentleman last up Ipoke
about the price of peace, he could not fay for
his part what would be the price of peace
hereafter, it the country once got involved in
war. He did not suppose we (hould be able
to beat the French so severely as to bring
them to ourown terms. He was himfelf very
unwillmg to go to war. He believed the peo
ple of the United States are delirous ot pre
serving peace, what had been
irtfinuated to the contrary, from the addresses
which had been sent to the President and to
Congress. We had, (aid he, a million of think
ing people within the United States, and sup.
posing all the addretlTes to be in favour of war
measures (whiph he was tar from believing)
they do not amount to more than 20,000. He
believed there are more persons in this city in
favour of war, than in any other part of the
United States. He was confident there are not
200 people in his diftrift who wish it. Indeed,
he saw nothing to be got for this country by
going to war. He said he (hould vote for this
amendment, because it would rake off a part
of the asperity of the. measure towards Frarce. j
Thequeftion was put and negatived, there I
being only 21 for it.
Mr. Lvon proposed to amend the bill by I
inserting the words M confidently with the laius
of nationsbut his motion did not find a fe
cpnd.
The committee then rose and reported the
bill.

To JOHN ADAMS,
PRFJID: MT oÂ» thi UNITED srÂ«TES.
Â»t a,
AS inhabitants of this ancient town,
which gave you birth, though now by its
division, Quiocy is honored, as the place
of your rtfidence, wc rettin that attention
and esteem for your personal honor and hap
piness, which are the natural result of such
a connexion; yet this is 1 circumstance of
very small confidrration, compared with o
ther reasons of at'achment and veneration,
which upon this trying crisis of political
emergencies, we beg leave to offer in the
following addrrfs.
Your promotion, fir, by the merited fuf
fragesof a free people to the chief feat of
government isacircumftance of preeminence
and honor to which despotic and hereditary
princes can never attain. Being thus made
by your country, the centre of their nation
al dignity, confidence and affe&ion, we
glnry in your great and acknowledged abil
ities as a statesman, and in your unabated
zeal, uttfhaken fortitude and perfev. rance as
a patriot; all which qualities have long since
been rendered conspicuous to your fellow,
citizens, and to the world, in yogr political
and eminent ferviccs. We contemn, fir,
as we know you do, the fawning paralite,
the flattering sycophant, as a reproach to
merited honor; a vermin that mars the tree
most, to which its attachment is apparently
the greatest. We (hould not, therefore,
presume to express the just sensibilities of
our hearts in language that would bear the
remotest resemblance to that praile so often
unjuftlv lavilhed upon tyrants, 10 answer
ends as base as their encomiums are falfe,
weve it not to contradict the envenomed
pens and tongues of reproach and slander.
which, with uncontrolled license, have been
attemp ing to tarnish the charafter, with
the honor, probity and firmnefs of which,
are intimately conne6led the political glory,
fafety and happiness of these united, sove
reign and independent dates.
Were you the man, fir, intriguing for 1
Britilh influence, and to yield up the inde
pendent glory of united America to the
nation from whose unconilimtional exaflions
you had the honor of being eminently in
ftr.imental in procuring our deliverance ; or
were y u secretly exerting your abilities to
prevent a compromif- with France, for an
amicable settlement of all real or imaginary
injures of which they complain, as has been
so ofien, so confidently, and, we fear, much
worse than ignorantly announced to the pub
lic, and which many, too many have been
Betrayed to believe,âwe (hould now, with
ur.fufferable regret, have to lament in our
firft Magistrate an itiftdnce of apoftacy, un
equalled in the page of civil hiltory. You
will then pardon our erithufiafrn, while in
your letter of credence to the French direc
tory, & the liberal^generous, p/ici:icinftruc
tions to our envoy , we fee the diforganiz
in tr designs of thajectet enemies of our unri
valled profperi'y, as in a moment defeated j
&, in fpight of malignity itfelf, the hontor of
our Executive, and government at large,
eftablifned by evideuce that enfortes con
viftion.
The joyous effeds are every where visi
ble 1 At the return of harmony in Congress,
the heart ol every true friend to America
exults : the people, who in great numbers,
before were alarmingly separated in affeÂ£tion
and confidence from their own government,
and rendered jealous of the firft charafters of
their own eleftion, convinced of the snares
spread for their country by foreign intrigue,
are now crowding to its standard, and c#n
fecrating their furtunes and lives for its de
fence. So signal a Provider e for the de
te&ion of fraud, and the coalition of a peo
ple. divided and confequcntly linking into
inevitable deftruft on, is perhaps a novelty
in the annals of nations.
While solemnly grateful to the all-dif
cening eye of divine benevplence, which has
brought to light those hidden things of
d rknefs by which so many of us have been
so unhappily deceived, we congratu'ate our
country at large that numerous private
friendfhips, which were violated, and other
wise good neighbors and important connec
tion* estranged from one another, are now
returning with mutual exftacy to the fra
ternal embrace. The uninformed and un
reasonably impaficned only, Hand at a for
bidding distance.
Disgusted at the illiberal a> ts and avarice
of thole, with whom our Envoys were ad-
f lifted to converfc, and at the refufal of au
ience by the French Direftoty, after so
friend'y an advance, accompanied with every
mark of refpctlful attention to fa great a
people,âa revolt frnm our over heated af
feft on for such a government,
of being the consequence. Sincere and
ardent was our attachment to the interests
of the French nation, while they stood on
their own defence, and preserved a spirit
limited by the decisions of reason but
when universal empire seems to be adopted
as their objeft, and the darkness of intrigue,
as a favorite measure to accomplish their ne
farious designs, when the price of friendlhip
with America is the prostitution of her
wealth, her honor, her independence, it must
be our duty to reprobate their pride, and
fptirn their insulting demands ; nor can the
genuine sons of America, though friendly
to France, and with their illustrious Execu->
tive, defirons of forming an al iance upon
foundations mutually just and beneficial,
forbear pledging themselves, for the defence
of their invaluable rights, against the un
provoked invasion with which we are threat
ened.
Acquiescing, fir, most cordially in your
public adminillration, wishing you the
guidance of Heaven in rvety duty of your
important and molt difficult llation, and
that thÂ« pen of slander, however artfully
aimed, miy rtrcr penetrate to dittnrb your
inward pcact and tranquility, or difcouragc
your rxefliooJ, ft ill so iecdfi:l, for tlie
profperii v of your country ; we beg leaÂ»e to

GENTLEMEN,
â¢ THIS kind address from the inhabitant

The torguea and pens of (lander, inftru

never made impreffior-s on you, my ancient

To TBl PRESIDENT OF tÂ«i UNITEDST^TES
SIR,
THE ability, re&itude and firmntfs
which have distinguished your administrati
on, and indeed every part of your conduit,
in the various important public stations, af
ligned you by your country, would render
unreceflary any aflurances of support from
U3, inhabitants of the ancient towns of Ply
mouth and Kingston, were it not of conse
quence to remove an imputation industrious
ly circulated, that the people of the United
States are divided from their government,
and henye may fall an easy vi&im to that
" destroying angel of republics" foieign in
fluence and intrigue.'*
â¢â¢ Enthusiastically attached to the eaufe
of the French," at the commencement of
their revolution, we devoutly wished them
success, in the establishment of a constitu
tion of governm nt, founded on the broad
basis of equalliberry and political happiness ;
but having departed from the system of fe*f
defence, having plundt red, demoralized and
prostrated all the countries subdued by their
arts, or their arms, and even now, with the
fame hostile views are contemplating new
cohquefts ; we cannot but consider them as
the' determined foes of religion, order, and
social security.
Regardkfs alike of the Laws of Nations,
and the faith of treaties, they have in open
defiance of both, wantonly captured and
condemned our peaceable (hips ; robbed and
maltreated our citizens, while pursuing their
lawful bufinefV on the Ocean, and when o
vertures of amicable accommodation are of
fered, instead of retribution, they imperi
ously demand the payment of immense sums
of money as the price of ncgociation, a
compliairce with which would comprpmit
our neuarality.
Indigiities and infultslo outrageous asd
unprovoked, have excited in us such fentf
ments of disgust and rcfentment, as would
have roused into a&ion the independent spi
rit of our venerable ancestors, who braving
every danger, bfgan here a settlement on
" bare creation," which by the wisdom of
their inllitutious, and under the patronage
of Heaven, has extended itfelf, and attnin
ed an height of improvement, with arapidity
unknown in the annals of the world. And
whofejdtfcendants, inheriting their hardi
hood and animated with the
splendor and~ dignity ofjtheir enterprize aid
example, will repel with indignant scorn,
the insolent aggre(lions of all the nations on
the earth.
Happy in the reflexion, tha* n-> measures
compatible with the national honor and fov.
ereignty, have been left uneflayed to avert
the calamities of war, you, Sir, will be pre
pared to meet every event ; and a govern
ment adminillej-ed with so fscred a regard
to the precepts cf political morality, will
command the aid of all virtuous citizens to
the utmost extent of their powers.
Being inhabitants of towns, who derive
their principal means of subsistence from the

GENTLEMEN,
This address from the mod ancient settle
ment in New-England, where, in the earlier
part of my 1 fe, I passed so much of my time
and with so much fatisfa&ion, gives me great
pleasure.
I trust we all still wish fuecefs to the
French in the establishment of a conftitntion
of government, founded on the broad basis
of equal laws and political happinessâbut
the system for cna&ing and executing equal
laws mult be better understood than ever it
ha 3 been, or all our best wishes will forever
be enfhufiafm and delusion ; and the French
will become enemies of the human race, a
gainst whom all nations wÂ» 1 have to unite.
When immense sums of moacy are de
manded as a price of negociation, a compli
ance would not only compromise our neutra
lity, but debase our minds, corrupt our
fouls and make, our own government in a
few years as profligate as theirs. It would
be the beginning of an habit in the minds
of our government and peoole of fnbmiflion
to injustice, insolence anddifgraceâlt would
lay a foundation for employing our own mo
ney in corrupting our own ele&ions. This
very money would be employed in hiring ve
nal writers and printers of scandal again ft
virtue, and panegyric upon vice. It would !
.but I mnft forbearâ-inhabitants of the old
colony of Plymouth cannot beir such indig*
I nities. Their yenerable*anceftors who bra
j ved every danger, and began a settlement on
bare c cation would not only have felt dif*
gust and resentment, but would have put
their very exiltenee, and that of the great
work of plantation, they had so much at
heatt, at hazard, rather than hav? submitted
to any thirk like it.
May your Fisheries, to which nature, u
sage, law and compa& have givm you a
rfglit, be forever preserved to your posterity
and prospered with that success which in
dustry and enterprize like yours will always
merit. JOHN ADAMS.
Philadelphia, June 8, 1798.
The Governor of Maftachufetts, in his late address
to the leg flaiurcot ih'at Uate, fays,
M The events ol the day draw our attention
from the more local concerns ol the Commonwealth,
to contemplate ihnfeof our nation at large.
â¢Â« The fuua i >n of our foreign relations, you ate
not ir.fei-fible ht>s bee nne critics I an-i alarming, and
calls for the united wisdom, decision and firmnefs of
the American government ; and for the unequivocal
aid and afliftance of t-a h member ol the Union. We
were led to slater â¢ uifeUes, si at the system of im
partial neutrality ?d opted by the exceptive, and which
we have ft'Uggled so Itng *0 m. intatn, would have
fhel'ered us trom fhfecalamities incident to a state of
war.âWhen the troubles of Europe commenctd, the
United States were at peace with the world, and
happy in the rrfleftion that no obligation compelled
them to intermeddle in their contcUs ; but had every
inducement to avoid it: having wifely adtvved this
system, our government end tvored 10 avoid every
just cause of complaint, and when injuftifiable dep e
datioos were committed on our commerce by one of
the belligerent powers, a treaty opened a way for re
mo" ing just grounds of un<afinefs by adjusting mutu
al demands. Thns a cent ft with that power which
then threa encd t?i, was happily prevented and peace
and haimony reftorad : *hen similar caules of com
plaint and uneasiness with another of those powers
cxifted, the Prtfidcnt ol the United vStates, anxious |
to p-eferve the good understanding which has so long
subsisted between the French and .American republics,
fu'fued similar measures, lor the reftoraiionof amity
and friendlhip between them. These overtures, af
ter a contemptuous rtje&ion in the firft in fiance, from
an extreme aefire to remove every reafonahle ground
of complaint, were renewed ; and with what lucce's,
let the communications from the envoys to our exec
utive declare! Could they have been furnifoed with
powers more ample, or have addrefTcd the govern
ment of France in language more refpe&ful, pathetic
or com iliating ? They aflure that government of 44 the
deep regret which the President of the United States
feels m the loss or fufpeniion of the harmony and
friendly intercourse which had (Ã¼bOfted between the
republics, and of his fircerc desire to restore them ;
to discuss candidly the complaints of France, and to
offtr frankly those of the United States; that he had
anthorifed a review of existing treaties, and such al
terations thereof, as (hallconfift wirh the mutual in
terest and fatisfafiion of the contrasting parties
At the fame time warmly expressing the happiness
they should feel, if their exertions could in any de
gree contribute to restore that friendlhip and mutual
interchange of good offices, wbich is alike their wish
and their duty to eft\tt between the citizens of the
two republics t" but instead of liftcningto those ref
pefiful, conciliatory overtures, our envoys have been
treated with a marked contempt,heretofore unknown
among civilized nations, and exorbitant sums of mo
ney demandedâon what preteÂ«Â»ce I know not, unlefa
it be to compeniatc the citizens of France for the
trouble they have been put to, in capturing and con
demning our property.
44 The calamities of war, we sincerely deprecate,
but are fully fatisfud that eVery effort has been made,
ftiort of national difoonor and degradation, to pre
vent them. The United States, contented with the
station which Heaven has been pleased to aflignthem,
have noreafonable wilh for aggrandizement, nojdefire
of conquest or extension of territory ; but are only
foiicitous for peace and that security to their proper
ty and independence, which the God of nature hath
given them a light to claim and enjoy : And while
the cars and hearts of the citizens of these states will
always be open to every reasonable proportion for
accommodation. I believe I am rot mistaken in fay
ing, they are determined never to submit to plans of
coeicion : for they well know that a people united in
a just cause, and roused by injuries and indignities to
resentment, cannot be easily conquered. Notwith
ftandmg individual citizens may have entertained dif
ferent opinioos, as to the motives and conleguenccs
of the wars and revolutions in Europe, yet I am con
fident, they will not disagree in one point; 1 mean
the nect fluyof union among ourfelvei, in order f|ic
ceWully to defend our liberties and independence
These incltimable bit flings have been tranl'miited to
us in#ire, by the virtuous struggles of our fathers,
who despised every danger, and encountered every
difficulty in their just defence; and (hould we resign
them to any nation on earth, wuhout ** one manly
struggle," should we not be considered as unfaithful
gnardiansof the facrrd trust ? Rather let us endea
vor honorably to discharge the debt by united efforts
to transmit the fair inheritance undiminifhed to pof-
I tCrity *
44 In such a contest all nations will do as the justice
to believe, that nothing hath been omitted on our
j?art, to prevent the evils and dtftrefles of warâand
that it a sincere desire to maintain the rights of neu
j trality, and to keep up a friendly interco-irfe with all
nationsâif exemplary moderation aud forbearance,
under accumulated injuriesâif the candid and liberal
declaration of the executive, that " it we have com
mitted errors, we willreftify them,"âif the moll
sincere and reiterated attempts at friendly negociation,
and even a predilection for the French nation, whom
we have been wont to regard with the mod (incete
friend (hip â¢, could have shielded the United States
from depredations and war, our tranquility would
not have been interrupted :âAnd thai, tf mercena
ry, exorbitant demands of money lor the privilege of
being heard, joined to the most pointed contempt of
our envoys and nation, aggravated by continual hos
tility on our commerce, can afford ground f-r the
claim of the rigUf ot defence against further ou rages,,
that this rioht of die United >taieswill remain unJif
pu ed May we not therefore, if driven to defence,
with huinb>c confidence, look up to the supreme
44 arbiter of nations,"for kis protection and blefling,
by granting fuccels to our exert ions against those* who
without any just cau'e alledged, seem to be dilpofed
to compel the United States 10 withdrawtheir friend
lhip and become their enemy . Do not thefatts be
fore ihe public, juftify the observation, that to fepa
iate the people Irom their government is a measure
unremittingly pursued, thereby destroying the ener
gy of government, and turning the force of a nation
a ainft ufelf What then is the duty of a private cit
izen ? It it not to exert his utmost ability to counter
act so dangerous, so fatal a policy ? What more cfpe
cia ly is the duty ol all our constituted authorities and
Inch ot our fellow-citizens as have officially bound
themfclves by the most solemn of all obligations, to
lupport the conftitutionof the United States?
44 in this unhappy exigency of affairs, I recom
mend to your immediate confederation, tke oecef
fary means Â«f defence, within this Commonwealth,
that they may be used with effect, whenever it
(hall bÂ« considered necessary by the government ot j
the United States ; particularly the important for- j
tification on Castle lfland ; this fortrefs, fÂ« essen
tial to the defence of the harbor and town of Bos
ton, in cafe of aflault or invasion, requires much
labor, and fonte expense, to give it that Â«ffe& in
repelling an enemy, which its very advantageous
situation would command. Some improvements
have been made, and with but little coll to tie
Commonwealth ; but to render it capable of inter
nal defence, it it neceflary a small work for fccuri
tv aeaird small arm*, ibould be conftrvded in the
centre of the place; this might be done with great
ease, and at small eipenfe, by employing the con
*i&Â» on the island in that ff rrire.
" I haÂ»e the fatitfa&ion to annonnct to you,
that the militia cf this Qate (with the except ion .i
a few corps) ii in very g.od order, and capable
of performing such ferÂ»icea at thÂ« exigencies of the
tinaeÂ« may poflibly require ;âif, however, any
thing can be done to make it mora efficient, I
(hall be hippy to concur with you in the measure.
" I will detain you longer, than to fagged
to your conGd ration the expediency of providing
a few heavy Brafi Field Piecei, to te diftrihuted â¢
upoo the feacoada would be highly ufeful
in cafe of aflault and deprcdatice fromfingle Ihipt,
ai they might be cafily transported from place to
place, as occasion may require.âWhilswe indulge
the hope that the French republic may yet alter
its meafares refpe&ing, the United States, and
render these precautionary steps unnecessary : yat,
I apprehend a sense of onr,duty and interest will
not fuller us to remain unprepared for the disagree
able events, which so flrongly threaten the peace of
the United States.
" In every measure, which fliall have for its ob
jeA the fefurity, peace anu prosperity of the peo

" Of tU Legi/lature of Majachufetlt
Tothe President of the United Sates.
be â Si'k,
be THE Legidature of Massachusetts, evtr
he anxious and long habituated to take an early
and decided part, in whatever relates to the
n- fafe' y and welfare of their country, beg leave
e- to join the United voice of your fcllow-citi
a" zeng, in offering you a testimony 6f their
refpeA and confidence.
Asa native citizen of this commonwealth,
3S and as the supreme Executive of the go.
,(1 vernment of our deliberate choicv, we feel
for yoÂ« tho e sentiments Â«f attachment and
veneration which the recolleflion of your
long, diftmguiffied and fuccelsful f.rvices
is calculated to excite ; and if the measures
of a wife and virtuous administration, such
as-we believe yours to have been, can re
ceive aid cr famfticn from our molt decided
and unequivocal approbation, cur duty in
exprefiing it will be discharged with in
crtafed fatisfaflion.
It is with a mixture of indigration and
regret, that we learn the Hate of our nego
ciations with th? French Republic. From
a careful reviewof our relations with France,
and of the unremitting eff.rts of the national
government, to preferve'and perpetuate her
triendlhip, we might readily have believed
â¢ that there could be no crisis in the progress
of her poli:ical career, in which her tran
quility could have been diflurbed. But
ainid It the collision of parties, France has
loft the objeft of her revolution. She once
fought for liberty ; (he now contends for
dominion ; and, having declared by the
voice of her Executive, that " Hie ought to
i, become the model and arbiter of naÂ«
tions, has violated th- rights of every
neutral people, and proflrated the govern
ments sf most of the republics in Europe.
Should any further attempt, eithrr to '
controul the government, or subjugate the '
people of the United States, be the result '
of her inordinate ambition, the citizens of â¢
MafTachufehs will meet them with the firm '
, and determined spirit of Freemen ; and as ,
. they have been among theftrjlto defend, will â¢
, jbe the lafl to rejlgn the rights of national F
f i fovereigmy.
1 | In this all important conflia, we expeft
t ( the resdy and zealous co-operation of the
" : free and enlightened people of America; and S
j 1 our country, having adypted every reafona- \
. ble measure to avert the calamities of war,
1 may, with humble confidence rely upon the S
1 God of our Fathers for proteftion and
' success. C
A people by whom the bledingj of civil 5
ai d religious liberty are enjoyed and duly *1
appreciated, will never surrender them but
with their livis. We will never forget, that ,
our character to this /ilerty, is feaJed by the V
blood of Americans I ai d we pledge to you fe
the pal riot ism, and all the energies oi our con- lt
, fti'Uents, that it (hall never be virlated by ol
the sacrilegious hand of foreign power. We
also molt folemniy pledge ourselves to sup.

NOTICE.
HAVING observed an advertifcmcct of C. I
Gullagcr, in terms derogatory of our pro- 1
sessional abilities, we have to request the public <
not to be imposed upon by foreign artists ; but to
decide upon the merits of each by a comparison oi
the work executed by both, as it is a mode almost
,s universally adopted by tkem to invalidate the ta
lents of eftabliflied artists, with a view of deceiv
ing the public, and engrossing that bufinef-s which
their profeffional knowledge in 110 wife entitles
them to. Well knowing that public opinion must
govern, we fottcr ourselves that the work execut
ed by us will convince them of our great superio
rity over Mr. Gullager in every branch of por
trait and ornamental painting, andfhew thenectf
fity of judging for themselves.
