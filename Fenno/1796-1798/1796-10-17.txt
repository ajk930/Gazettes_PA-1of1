THOMAS jEFFERSON, secretary of state
g e> of the United States, in his letter to the negro
Banncker, acknowledges himfelf converted from
all his former opinions, refpefling the inferiority ot
. the black race, and declares himfelf convinced
" that nature has given to his black brethren talents
equal to those sf other colourt, and rkat the appear
ns ance of a want of them is owing merely to the dt
' graded condition of their existence botU in Africa
and America." He concludes his fraternizing epis
tle with these words, " I can add with truth, that
nobody ivi/Les more ardently to fee a good ffliem
commenced fur raising the condition both of their
vi- body and mind to what it ought to be, at fajl as the
iif- imbecility of their present exillence and otl)tr tircvm
11 c |' fiances which cannot be neglected, will adianit 1"
18 s Notwitkflanding the caution and cunning with which
j the latter sentence is worded, to admit of a double
interpretation, if necefiarj, it cannot be denied
jhat, taking the whole letter together, it meant to
ms. express to the negro, Benjamin, an ardent wi(h to
fee an early system of emancipatitn.in the southern
um states: he bad jurt said, that nature had given to
n l his black brethren talents equal to those of the whites,
and that the appearance of a want of them was ow
ing merely to their degraded condition; he immedi
ately ardent wish for a good system for
raising the condition both of' their body and mind t6
ne i- 'hat it ought t> be, that is, in plain English, " from
an ' the degraded condition of slavery to a Rate of free
dom." The qualification subjoined, viz. " As
fad as the imbecility of their present cxiftence, and
other circumjlanees which aannot be negleSed, will
admit was introduced as an artful salvo, not too ]
far to commit himfelf: behind these equivocal ex-
; n '' preffions he thought himfelf fhcltered from an at- ]
~ tack in the southern states ; he might, if pushed, ,
j or construe them into an opinion, that for ccnturies j
U p to come, emancipation would be impolitic and dan* ;
1m gcrous, because other circumJlances would not jufti- ]
til- fj the measure. But this is certain, that had fee |
} viewed the measure of emancipation as a dangerous j
r s one, either he would have difeountenanced it, or at ,
lealt, on so delicate a fubjeft, kept Went. Why ]
such an answer to the negro* letter ? Why not ,
eonfine his anfwÂ«r merely to the almanac, and to ]
the usual compliment on such an occasion ? Why
an make a parade%f his opinion, by extolling the na- j
tural genius of the blacks, reminding them of their }
'b- degraded condition and expressing a wiflÂ» to fee it f
t0 " changed ? Either he was a friend to emancipation, j
jj- s or he was not : if the former, then the qualifies- }
tion refpe&ing othermrcunfluncss was absurd and un
eft meaning; if the latter, then the encomiums on the 1
:o- talents of the blocks, and his ardent with for their J
' r - release from their degraded condition, were equally :
absurd. Again, he tells Baniieker, and through j
him all the negroes in Americai " I an fatisfied
l, e that your natural talents are equal to those of the ,
whites, and that the appearanceai a want of them
in you is owing merely to the degraded eonditiun of
your exigence now what does he mean by ad
j ding, " I wish to fee you emancipated, as fooH as
the imbecility of your present existence will admit ?'*
If' the appearance of {heir want of talents wasjpw- i
ing merely to their condition, the sooner they errwrg
ed from that condition the better; if their imbe
cility wa3 produced solely by their degradation,
that imbecility would cease the moment they were
emancipated ; what kind of teafoning is it, to
charge their imbecility altogether to (.heir coÃdi- v
tion, and yet to expert an amelioration of their w
reason antecedently to their change of condition { ai
It is no better than the blunder of the Irijhman, P
who would not fuffer his son to go into the water, jj
until he could swim. According to our author'* tt
mode of reasoning, the negroes could never be e
mancipated, his ardent wish could never be gratifi
f- ed j the flÂ»very of the negroes he fays is the sole a t
cause of their imbecility ; but he immediately adds fa
they might remain in slavery 'till their minds are >!<
'' enlightened. How arc they to acquire this neceflary Q |
pie-iequifitetoemancipatioÂ», when,according to his te
j. dodlrine, that pre requilite can only be obtained st!
after emancipation ? Here is such a jumble of ideas, fl
ia such a confousding of cause and effeil in this letter, j r
that the production of it by a man of common la
undcrftanding can only be accounted for by afcrib
lf ing it to a pitiful grasp at popularity from a class
which he had dcfpifed, and to an ardent wish for C c
the emancipation of the southern negroes, fliroud
'â¢ ed in the cautious and ambiguous language of one, P r
s who thought the times not yet ripe enough for a jfj
full difclafure of his dangerous views.âAnother A
qualification in his letter refers to " other circum- bu
Jlances, which cannot be negle&ed 1" What cir- a '
cumltances had he in view, ta prevent the immedi- an
y ate emancipation of the blacks ? Does he allude tr;
to the difficulties which would oppose his tranfpert- m
Is. at ion scheme ? Sure the negroes would not thank
him for their liberty on such terms ; but in his fu
Notes on Virginia he is decidedly of opinion that
the negroes ot the United Statee, when freed, [ rl
d rnufl be removed beyond the reach of mixture ; ra
;s ther a treatment for his black brethren 1
Whence proceeds this right of transportation tc
(without a crime or convifkion) llur philosopher Ii
has not informed us, and on what pretext of law S
or justice, freemen, not even charged with any of. tl
r- fence, are to be shipped off, like cattle, lam una- h:
ble te discover : had he proposed shipping them C c
off, while slaves, there would be more sense in the
projeA, but firlt to erAancipate and invest them , e
with all the rights of free citizens, and then forth.
with to treat them as slaves and cattle, is altogether fu
unintelligible. 4K r v
ie Perhaps the projeWwas, to make it a preliminary ar
condition fiue qua non with the Africans that they m
iiould be free, lubjeft to immediate transportation : fe
but when free, it is doubtful how many of them fa
would confidtr themselves bound by such a coÃdi- S
tion ; indeed it is questionable whether many of fa
them would accept their freedom on such terms, hi
But waving thtfe difficulties, how impolitic would n<
it not be to banish from the country feveial hun- pi
dred thousands of our black brethren, to whom na- R
lure has given talents equal to our own, and who in
spite of their monotonous colour and offenfive few
. fictions (circumflances common to thousands of tl
' colours) might become very ufeful citizens, a
\
" who according to the JeeTrtery's letter -,vÂ®u!d rank,
with 'the whites in point of genius and nieri.,.Ht
the very instant of their emancipation. It the se
cretary of (late meant in his letter to allude to his
{hipping project by the words eircumflances,
ro jt would have been but can3i'd in 'him to have un
m folded to his black brethren the whole extent of his
views, that they might be fully apprised of the
terms.on which they had his ardent r/ifhes for eman
'ts cipation. Having omitted so efTential a part oi
r- the plan, it l's to be presumed that he has abaudon
lt- CC I it. and now wishes for their emancipation, as
fajl as other circumflnnces will allow it to be accorr.-
if- plifhed, that is, Â£\s feon as he (hall find it conveni
at ent todifpofe of bis own, and as soon as the mea
m fures which are now pursuing for that purpose in
' r f;vera) of the states, even in some of the fotithern
,e states, and the principles which have been trarf
" planted from the French colonies ihto America, and
his countenance as Prrfidcnt of the United Slates,
(hall combine to make the measure appear pra&ica
k ble in the eye* of its promoters.
d It appears almost incredible sand could not he
0 credited had we not the facts before our eyes) that
0 the fame Thomas Jeffetfon, who not many years ago
n ptibliflicd to the world his opinion, '* that there
0 " were powerful obstacles to the emancipation of
Â®Â» " the black?, because deep rooted prejudices en
" tertained by the whites, ten thousand recellefii
" oris by the blacks of the injuries they have fuf
)r " tained, new provocations, the real diftindlions
6 " which fiature has made, and many other clrcum
-71 " stances, will divide us into parties and produce
E " " Convul/ions which will never end but in the exter
'' " min/ition of the one or the ether race," (hould have
d recently, declared his ardent -with forfuch emancipati
l! on, at thep(k of all the horrid consequences which
Â® he had himfelf so strongly depiÂ£ted.
â " if such a wonderful change has been wrought in
â * his mind, to what are we to impute it ? I can find
'Â» no other clue to it than the delusive and visionary
principles which he has imbibed Â®n that fubjeft by
J" his rtfidence in France. It is to be remarked that
he publilhed his natfes en Virginia, after spending
e greatest part Â®f his life in Virginia, among N_e
18 gree holders and Negroes, and at a period when he
' be presumed to be pretty well acquainted with
Y Negroes, and aware of the cosfequences of their i
1 emancipation; he wrote his letter to Banneker, the
0 Negro, soon after his return from France.
y If his sentiments on thisfubjett were not chan- ]
gcd w hen he wrote to the Negro, then his letter to 1
r him is a piece of gross hypocrisy, calculated tÂ» '<
1 filch a little .popularity from a few free Negroes, 'â¢
'Â» and the friends ef emancipation at the expence of '
l - his own chara&er and of the peace of his country. '
Whether the Secretary complied with the pro- 1
e mife made in that letter to Banneker "of fending
r his almanac to the great philofc: Condurcet," as
y a testimony of his black brother's extraordinary ge
nius, we have never learnt.

/ AUSTRIAN ACCOUNT OF THE RAISING THÂ£
SIEGE OF MAN". UA.
\ The fortrefs of Mantua has been invested fix weeks by the
1 enemy. On the 6ch and 16th July, the forties (already
J known) were made, under general Vukuffowich, in which the
TihstJm v were foond much Wronger than it was supposed, and
which they loft near 1400 men. The want of fodder for
the Cattle in the fortrefs. occafoned the firft sortie. In the
nf|>ht of the 15th of July, the enemy besan to bombard the
cfty and citadel from four batteries. âThey attempted toftorm
itâbut were thrice repalfed by gen. Ruckowina, with the loss
of 900 men, kiiled and wounded, during the storm, the e
nemy had dug trenches in the foft ground before the glacis,
and continued their works, notwithflariding the violent firing.
Â£ Lite bombfrdment lasted without interruption ; the fcre broke
it out several times, and did no fmali damage to some buildings
lS On the 20th. gen. Buonaparte iiimmoncd the fortrefs to fur
, render: the summons was answered by a refusal. Althbugh
< many of the enemy'* pieces of artillery were often difmount#
O' ed, yet they violently hattered thetown from a second paral
e lei of three batteries. Mear.while it was agreed to spare the
hospitals for the Tick,,on both fides, which were ditlinguifiled
' by black flags. On the 27th, .'heeiÂ»emy repeated the lecond
** aflault upon the entrenchment of Miglraretto, and on the 29th,
c the third, but pen Ruckowina beat them off, with the fame
bravery at the firft time.
The enemy, who fuiUincd confidciable loss, dragged back
their dead and wounded into the trenches, so that their loss
cannot be ftriftly afcertauried. â Notwithftandiug all this, the
- bombardmcrv continued Wsthout interruption 'till the last
e davos July, at 11 o'clock at night, when the last bombs and
red hot ball? were thrown into the city. Buring tho night
theie was a rat. lingof waggons, and in the morning a general
> stillness wat percei ed in the enemy's trenches. A reconnoi
tring immediately was made, and the enemy being discovered
. Â©n theirretreat, were instantly pu> sued. Count Canto d'Yrles
allures, that the quantity of provisions, an d all kinds of mili
â¢ tary stores taken irorn the enemy, is so great that it will re
n quire some weekitotake oroper inventories of them. There
0 being a want of troops, wre armed, and with
n their afliftance there were made priloners in divers place}, one
ten Officers* two Secretaries, add 582 Privates.
I PrifooerÂ® are continually brought in, and inagazmes of pro-
U I vision the enemy difcovercd, Near Guito thee,
neiny were obliged to take to flight precipitatelyâand they
also left there a confidcrable magazine of hay straw. Count
Canto is now occupied with deftroyiag the enemy's batteries
and trenches. The lof* which the Auftrians sustained fmce
this place was firft invrfted, down to the raising of the fiegc,
b amounts to 120 men killed, 395 wounded, including 14 offi
cers, and 87 men miffing. Kie)d-Mar(Vial-Lieut, count Canto
d'Yrles cannot fuflicicntly praise the courage and condutt of
y the whole garrison ; âMajor-Geneials Rukowina, Vukaffo
j wich, &c. have particularly ffgoaliierf themselves. The Field
j j Marshal Lieut, oan never bellow futiicicnt praise on the patri

s The following letter from an officer oil hoard

j lite atrhievement of Sir John Borlafe Watren.
" F r tmc lias enabled us to annoy the enemy ef
,(â¢ feiiually :âOn Sunday the 301k uk. at 6 A. M.
,{â  Bei de Ray bearing S. S. E. 6 leagues, and Ufhant
N. N.-E. 9 miles, a convoy coniilting of 11 fail

J and upon our nearer approach, perceived it to con
,f lift oi a French frigate of 32 gnu#, and a brig cor
vette of 8 guns, the relt merchantmen, who, finding;
, they could not get through the psfLge ot the
e Saints, bore up, and inn iÃto Douaray bay ; but
, r fiom the superiority of failing of out squadron, we
(. cutoff the convoy from,their efcort< La t'omone,
Anfon, and Artois, pursued the frigate and cor
vette, who continued running towards the end of
n the bay to a small river, railed Poldare, iir which
n was a small creek, protcited by batteries. We con
a tinned the pnrfui; until the frigate haj run aihore,
and we brig so much, that, had (he
n been in deep water, (he must have gone to the bot
n torn : but, at all events, (he never can be of use to
j. the enemy, our fh-Jt having done the business effec
j/ tually. Being within three leagues of Brefl, and
having a bay of aliroft that length to work out of,
[, Â«nd the wind blowing pretty flroog Irom the weft
e ward, nijjht coming on, and the ebb tide having
r made, which might have eafilv brought,any force
e they thought proper round from Brett, we thought
it advifeable not tb anchor in the bay, or to endea
c vor to carry off, or annoy the enemy any more,
,1 but use our utmost to get out, to sea. During our
trai fatiions-wit'n the frigate and corvette, the Ja
-11 son, G'll.itea, Argus, and Dolly cutter, were em- â 
,f ployed hoarding the merchantmen. We had the

(hore, and ft-'ting fire ro nine fail of them, who were
8 all in ballad, and burnt down tojpPwater's edge,
