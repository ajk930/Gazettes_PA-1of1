# CONTINUATION OF
FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE,
BY LATE ARRIVALS.
SCHAFFAUSEN (Switz.) July 9.
" In confequesce of tUe iuccefics of the French,
and their promptitude in following up their advan
tage! over the allits, Condc's army was cut off frem
the Imperial army, and hid themselves in the Black
Forest near Sultz. Daterrained, however, to come
out, their retreat was marked with every kind of
excefi that could be perpetrated by a licentious sol
diery; they pillaged houses, and fired villages, and
violated the chastity Â«f wives and daughteit. Se
veral troops of the Empire, and'a party of the Su
abian militia, toufed with indignation on hearing
of these exceffcs, engaged the emigrant army and â¢
routed them. A vail number remained dead on
the field of battle, and the survivors were pursued
and dtfperfed in the foi eft.
" The French army in Suabia amounts to 70,00 to
men. The battles, which take place between the
Republicans and the Emigrants, are moll oblliuate
and bloody, and for the mod part terminate in the
utter deftru&ion of the one or the other party." â 
PARIS, July 9.
The Emigrants who have been obliged to quit
Switzerland, are dated at 8 or 10,000. There
have been no exceptions.

Meflidor, (June 29,)
" Citizen DireSors,
" In my dispatch of yesterday 1 announeed to
you, that after the evacuations of the camp of Bif
fel, General Defaix proceeded rapidly with tha
troops destined to the attack of the camps towards
Appenhyic and Rataffen, forefeeingj that the rein
forcements which the enemy had received from the
lower Rhine, would bring on aferious engagement.
" General St. Susanne, who remained at Rataf
fen to keep them in check, was already engaged
with the enemy when these troops under Deftix ar
rived there. , /
" The enemy occupied the excellent poftiion in
front of the village of Renchen and of the river of
that name, rendered famous by Marshal Tu-enne's
passage of it.
" The battle began with <he utmost obftitiacy ;
the cannonade was terrible ; the enemy prote&ed
by a wood on their rear, manoeuvred with rapidity
in order to surprise one of our flanks j but the re
fervy, dtre&ed in a proper manner, rendered their
attempts useless, and drove them back every time
with loss.
The cuirafliers of Kawanack at length at
tempted to turn our right and charged with vigor j
but two battalions of the 97th demi-brigade, sup
ported by tbe carabineers and the light artillery,,
drove back the cuirafliers, and though fwrrpunded
on all fides they manaeuvered with fang froid, in or
der to direct their fire to all the points where they
were menaced. The enemy left the field of battle
covered with dead bodies aud harfes.
" Without being di(heartened by the check, the
â¢enemy directing a grand effott againft-our left, at
tempted to turn it, and attack it in front. At the
moment in which our infantry were ready to pene
trate into the wood, they attacked it with their
whole cavalry with great impetuosity. This move-,
ment had beenforefeenâGeneral St. Suzanne im
mediately made Adjutant-General Levaffeur charge
the cavalry in flank, at the head of the Chasseurs,
and in front by the 6th dragoons and 15th cavalry.
Aftoniftred at this mqvement, the enemy were soon
put to a complete rout by the rapidity of the
charge.
" The infantry, cavalry, and artillery favinp
themselves in the greatest disorder, the 84th and
10th ciemi.brigades parfued them as quickly as the
horfe ; the grenadiers of the last brigade took two
pieces of cannon, and in one instant we were mas
ters of the river and the village of Renchen.
" As soon as the defiles were occupied we con
tinued the pursuit. General St. Suzanne's Aid-de
Camp came up with them at Valenbacli ; in a mo
ment they were defeated and put to the rout. The
troops did not stop till night, and uutil loaded with
borfesand prisoners they Could go no further.
" loss of the enemy was enormous. We
took ia killed and wounded 600 horses, and made
1,200 prifosers, 500 of whom arc waunded, 10
pieces of cannon, and almost all the light infantry.
The field of battle vrtls covered with dead bodies.
Â« Such complete success, Citizens Direflors,
renders it unnecessary to make an eulogium upon the
troops; they shewed a courage and a coolness of
which there are few examples.
" General Defaix end St. Sufanne, Â»nd Adju
tant-General Decamp and Levefleur, and the Chief
of Brigade, Fouconnot, manoeuvred with admira
ble precision and bravery.
" Citizens Vigneron and Young, Lieutenants in
the 7th drrgoons, particularly distinguished them
selves in the pursuit of the enemy. The former
took the commander of the rear guard, whom he
had wounded, and to whom he immediately admi
nistered the neceflary affittanee with an eagerness
whieh he did not (hew for his own wounds, which
he would not have drefled till after the affair.
" As soon as 1 shall have received a report upon
the other traits of bravery, 1 will give you aa ac
count.
" Health and refpedl,

" Citizen Diredors,
"ON the 13th (July 1J we pttfhed a Teconnoi
tering party to the camp of Babrac. The enemy
occupied it as well as the position of Knubis, at
the back ef the black monntains. All the advanced
posts of the enemy were Â£riven into the camp.
" A company of grenadiers of the 100 th detni
bngade, charged by 150 Emigrants, who called
oÂ»t |o them to iurtgidcr, and cry Five la R*i,
and they would do them nÂ» harm, replied tpr a w<?.. j
dire&ed fire, which killed 20 of the Emigrants; 1
the rcit fled, The grenadiers would hare injured *
themfelve* by the pursuit if they had tiol been t
checked. . 8
â¢ " Or. the 14th (July 2) Brigadier-Genera! La t
Riche proceeded with the 2lfl demi-brigade of v
light-infantry and a detachmeHt of the second re- j
giment of chaiTeurs to Openau and Kflubit. The
defile of Renchen which he had to penetrate, was
full of enemy's troops, and of armed peasants, c
whom, hovyever, he soon difp'erfed. He found the Â£
enemy in great force upon the mountain of Knubis, {
the highift of the Black Mountains ; he did not
hesitate to attack them, in spite of the obftav'les %
which the ground presented, without artillery; {'
the roads would not permit him to h *Â« any.
" After having driven them from the Mountain,
â where they had made the mod obilinate rsfiftance, ]
there remained to be carried a very strong redoubt,
which the enemy had built upon the lummit, with
a casement surrounded by a ditch.
The courage and impetuosity of the French, t
could alone overcome such an obstacle. General (
Larochc was the firft to jump iato the ditch ; and f
notwithstanding the terrible fire of those who de- c
fended the redoubt, and the grenade* which they a
threw into the ditch, he scaled the walls at the head t
of the brave chasseurs whom he commanded. ]
" The loss of the enemy was confidersble ; the
field of battle was covered with dead bodies. Four
hundred pt ifoneis were taken, two pieces of cannoa.
and two pair of colours.
" The prince of Wurtemburg, commanded in c
person, and, before the affair, he harrangued {lis t
troops, hoping, he said, they would defend the rc- {
doubt better than they had done Keltl. \
" I have conferred the rank of corporals on ci- c
izens Saboron and Dumont, wlio were the firft to ]
reap into the redoubt, and to take the colours. {

" General Jotirdan did not wait, in order to re- '
turn to the right bank of the Rhine, and to join '
Kleber, for the retreat of the army, encamped be- '
twten Neuwied and BendorfF. He forGtd them
to baften in difotder by passing the Rhine in their '
fight, and in strong force. This expedition, whose 4
boldness astonished the enemy, was attended with 1
complete success. i
" While these intrepid Republicans, by the ac- '
tivity of their movements, and multiplied acts of '
the highest valor, forced the enemy's columns to '
precipitate flight, the bridge of Neuwied was re- f
established; and at the end of five hours, the di- *
vifwtn landed in the plain, formed, and parfued the '
Auftrians. The terior which this unexpected pas- <
fageoccafioned was fueh, that one of their Gene- 1
rals surprised at his head-quarters at BendorfF, could 1
only faye himfelf by leaving his baggage, papers, 1
&c. behind him. <
"It is certain, that if we could have had fufEci- <

been cut off. t

Extradl of a letter from Capt. Trollope, of his
Majesty's (hip Glatton, to Vice Admiral Mac
bride, commanding his Majesty's (hips and vcilels
to Yarmouth Roads, dated the 21 It mil.
" I beg leave to inform you, that in pursuance
of your orders, I failed in his Majesty's ihip Citat
ion, on the 15th of July, ftom Yarmouth Roads,
in order to join Capt. Savage and a fqundron isnder
his command ; and 0:1 ihe 16th at one, P. M. we
observed a squadron about four or five leagues off
Helvoet. Owing to light winds and calms it Was
seven P. M. before we were near enough to difco
ver'the squadron to coiifift of fix frigates, one oÂ£
which, the commodore's ftiip, appeared to mount '
fifty guns; two otlrrfS "appeared about thirty-fix
guns, remarkably fine long frigates, and the other
three smaller, and might mount about twenty-eight
guns eacfy. There were also a very fine brig and
cutter with them. .We soon suspected, from their i
signals, and their not anfweringcur private signals,
that they were enemies, and immediately cleared
for a&ion, and bore down to them.
From their manceuvfing it was ten at night be
fore we got close along fide the third ftiip in the
enemy's line, which from her fizc, we suppose to be
the commodore j when after hailing her and find
ing them to bÂ« a French squadron, I ordered him teÂ»
strike his colours, which he returned with a broads
fide, and I believe was well repaid by one from the '
Glatton within twenty yards 5 after which the ac
tion became general with the enemy's squadron, tha
two headmost of which had tacked, and one of the
largest had placed herfejf -along fide, and another orÂ»
our weather bow, and the fternmoft had placed
themfelres on. our lee quarter and stern ; in this
manner we were engaged on both fides for a few
minutes, with our yard arms neatly touching those
of the enemy on each fide ; but I am happy to ac
quaint you that in less thau twenty minutes the
weight of our fire hid beat them off SiraTl TTties ;
but when we attempted to follow them, we, niuclÂ»
to our regret, fonnd it impossible. I have no
doubt, from the apparent confufion the enemy were
in, we fh&uld have gainer! a detifive vhSory, but un
fortunately, in attempting to wear we found every
part of our running rigging totally cut to pieces*
and the major part of our Handing rigging : every
flay, except the mizen, either cut or badly wot'ii
ded, and our mails and yards eonfiderably damaged.
In this situation, although every officer and man
exerted tfcerafelves to the utmoll the whole night,
it was seven in the morning before the (hip was in
tolerable order t* have renewed the aflion. Tfie j
enemy, who appeared in tfie morning ip a clofts 1
line, seemed to have suFFered very little i , t rig
ging, although lam Gertain they mud ha>Â«. much
damage in their hulls, at which the whole of one
fire waÂ« directed. As they did not chufeto come
near us again, although they mud plainly have fecit
our disabled state, but made the bed of their way
for Flushing, and we followed them as close as we
could till the 17th at nine A. M. when they were
within three leagues of that port, with the hopeÂ®
of meeting with fprne affi(lance to enable me to-deÂ»
ftroy them ; hut it coming on to blow hard at W.
in the disabled (latethe foip .was in, we were forced
to haul off the shore ; but although we were ndc
able to take any of them, I trull you will think
the officers and men whom I have the honor to
command in the Glatton, to whom f have rta&>n to
give every merit for their Heady, gallant, and cool
behaviour in the attack, having done theii utipoft,
and also some gbod, in driving Co very superior a
Force into port to refit that might have done very
considerable damage to our trade had they got to' *
sea. 1 cannot conclude this without recommen
ding to your notice, in the flrongefl manner, lieute
nant Robert Williams (2d) my firfl lieutenant, who
gave me every afiiftance in his power on the upper
deck : and also lieutenant Scbomberg, second lieu*'
tenant, who commanded on the lower deck 1 and
also Captain Straogeways, of .the marines, who, I
am very sorry to acquaint you, has received a bad
wound from a mufquct ball in his thigh, which is
not extracted yet, who, after he had teceived it,
and had a tourniquet on, infilled on coming on
deck to his quarters again, where he remained, en
couraging his men, till he was faint with the loss of
blood, and 1 was under the necefiity of ordering
htm to be carried down again ; and all the warrant
and petty officers and ship's company behaved ai'
English sailors always do on such occasions. And I
am particularly happy in acquainting you, that I
have not loft one life in so warm an adtiou, and on
ly one wounded besides Captain Slrangeways, vis,
William Hall, the Corporal of Marine, who also
received a m-ufquet bail through his thigh bone;
the ball pafled out on the eppbfite fide. Ourfmall
loss can only be attributed to their firing totally at
our rigging to disable 11s, in which ttiey too well
succeeded ; and hig majesty's ftiip Glatton, being
unfit to keep the sea from the damage (lie has recei
ved in her masts, yards, and rigging, l'bave though;

"On 'he 7thof February, Major Petrie march- Re
ed with 4 considerable detachment from Nigambo, Bal
and eroded a river 10Â© yards broad, deep, but not
rapid, the whole distance making about 11 nlilcs.j jetjt
" The Bth, moved forward, and reached a deep
Nullah, where had been a strong wooden bridge, 1
which the enemy destroyed on our approach. As cop
the Nullah was not fordable, it was necessary to re- pen
pair the bridge, which detained us some hours. em
The Nullah was diltant about four miles from our
former ground, and we encamped at Pafiibattal on her
the large river Mallway two miles farther. On
the opposite banks of this river, which is 170 yards
broad, the enemy were potted in considerable force, t(j ;
having with them fix pieces of light cannon. nlu
" About two miles farther up, and nearly the tivi
fame distance towards the fca, they had established cor
themselves in the fame manner. We halted until
we were joined by Colonel- Stuart with the line, mc )
and to allow time to provide rafts and boats. This
riÂ»er is three miles from Colombo ; and every ap- g ta
pearance threatened an obltinate refinance. to 1
"Ob the 10th, the enemy perceiving probably coi
some of our parties, discharged 18 guns, but with- ing
out doing us any damage.
" On the nth, to our complete aftoniftiment,
this formidable pass was discovered to be abandoned,
and with the utmost expedition we crbflei almost t0
all the army in the course of the fame day. W V
"On the 1 zth, the flank companies were at- th<
tacked by 200 Europeans and 600 Malays. The flic
line was ordered to advance for th.eir support ; but
before any of the corps could render any effe&ual
aid, they had charged and totally defeated the ene

"In the beginning of the action, the Malays as
displayed their usual treachery, and appeared be hi
fore our pods making signs of fubmiflion, laying de
their dresses, &c. on the ground : a Dutch officer i s
disgraced himfclf by a similar conduct. de
'â¢ We have now taken up our final position a- ed

Pettah, and all our are now to land our fp

and defpundency." tr

evening a cessation of hostilities was proclaimed fipr w
24 hours, when it was understood that articles of h;
capitulation were agreed to. f
" The 15th was employed in finally adjnfting lt
the teims of the surrender ; and this morning, at
ten o'clcek, the flank corps of the three regiments, 8
two companies of aitillery, the 52 regiment and
grenadier battalion, took pofleffion of this import- B
ant eonqueft. 31
" Since the affair of the 12th not one (hot had

exhibited the molt apparent marks of imbecility b
and indecision.
" I am not informed of the particular articlea
