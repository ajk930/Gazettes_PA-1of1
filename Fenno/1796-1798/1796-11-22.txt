There ate four diftrifts in the E.'S. of MaTy- |^ a

are elected. The' Hon. .Judge Done, Gen. Jdhn

supposed to be anti-federalâthus on the Eastern
â¢Shore of Maryland, we have three out of four, fe-
detal electorsâin Dorchester county tbe Democra- -
tic candidate had but one vote, in neariix hundred
that were polled at the cleft ion. ,
The jacobin faflion after being "repeatedly/oiled meÃ
by their efforts to amend our codfiitation, have for atro
the fake of. encreafing their number, coalesced with "PÂ°
'the old tories, arid even condescended to place one \

knowing that an old tory will ever be true in hatred 7e "

Mx- Ftitno,
1 observe in yoor gazette that a oidevant tory is
-attacking the writing! (reu/and supposed I )' and the
tharaSer as the Vice-President at the United States'.
Tkc circumftafice is in perfect coincidence with the
conduQ of the tory faction thro' the whole course
of the revolutionâMr. Adams it is well known
was the atlas of the *hig interest, and no man in
-America was so much feared and execrated by the
loriesâtheir malignity is not extinctâat the late
Â«lection it was declared by some of the anti federa
lifts, thet they hated the very name of Adams. It
il now abundantly evident that the objections to
that man are founded in his peffevering attachment
to thofc principles which gave us our independence
âprinciples from which he never deviatedâwhich
ke will support to the end of bis exiftenceâmaugre
all the intrigues of foreign agents and domestic
traytortâthia they knowâand for thUthey oppose
kim.
The legislatures of the Tcveral dates are answer
ing the appeal to the people by citizen Adet, in a
manner that mull silence the enemies of our union,
peace and â¢iNDEl>iNPÂ«t*c&. The legiHatures of
Hew York and New-Jersey, have entered the Pre
fident'a address on their journals, and every state in __
the union will doobtlefs Follow the example. Uni
ted, we Jiand.
The public CUHÂ®Â»iTY has been excited by the
publications in the Aurora, relative to a long note
Â«f Mr. Adet, announcing to the government of the
"United States the fufpenGon of his fun&ioafc as mi
jiifter plenipotentiary of the French republic ; a
rote so very long as "to prevent its immediate jh<
jicatiaa." But to relieve in some degree the impa- j th
of the public, citizen Bache has had the j V'
goodness to publish" a sketch of its contents." In, 1
the mem time, it iÂ« said, he has been working off :
privately, in pamphlets, the entire note, for the use Â£
of the chtfen friends of Ftench politics and French
< influence ; doubtless to be applied to the like patri- "V
otic purposes, as his edition of the British treaty be- A
fore it received the President's ratification. The
real patriots, the ftiends of American independence,
will be on their guard again ft the inOdious designs
of the devoted tools of a foreign power. Their g
examination of the note itielf, which has this morn
jng appeared in Mr. Brown's paper, will produce
this caution.
This long note appears to be occupicd in a de
clamatorjr detail of old complaints of the French (
jninifters against the United States. The minilter ,
goes back to the meraornblrtiays of Mr. Go rt, and )
roundly shargee the government of the United
States with a violation even of the letter of their 5
treaties with France. The eomplaints hang chief- j
ly on pretended violations of the 17th article of the (
commercial treaty. Mr. Genet's printed ccrref- ]
pondcnce witk Mr. Jsfferfon, in 1793, Iliows how ,
erroneously a French miaifter may that ar
ticle ; how erroneously he may interpret the plain
est and most incontrovertible laws of aat-ions; and
then raise upon his own errors a mass of complaints 1
aÂ» indecent in terms as unfounded in reason. The
citizens of the United States have seen that corref
pondenoc, and thence may form a pretty cor reft idea
of the tenor of Mr. Adet's long note ; with this
difference, that while the pointed abuse from the
former miniftcr raised the indignation of every in
dependent American, his fpiritand vivacity yielded
fomearouft/uent : in reading thi noteof tl.elaJUT;
o'lv one feniiaient will be extitcd. , , tical ;

by parliament, that there was no way likely to ob- he
tain t peace, commonly fafe and but ro
through the antient and legitimate government long
' established in France. That government in its law- dui
fulfuceeffion has been folewnly recognized, anrf [h ,
.ffiftance and ptoteftion as solemnly proofed to v.f
those Frenchmen who lhÂ«uid exert themlelves m #f

None have yet been employed with the imalleft de- f 0
jrree of vigour and perfcverance. Â«"
* 7 th, Because the example of the great'change â¢
piacie by the ufarpauon in the moral and political
world (more dangerous thirt all her conque#Â») is >]
by the prcfent procedure confirmed in all its force.
It is the firft fuccefsful example furniftied by history
of the subversion of the antient government of a pj
eteat country, and of all it* laws, orders, and re- ge
licrion, by the corruption of mercenary armies, and Â«
by the feduftion of a niultitude, bribed by confu
tation to feditios, in defiance of the sense, and to ne
the entire deftruftion of almost the whole proprie- gÂ»
lory body of the nation. The fatal effe&s of this
â¢sample must be felt in Â«very country. New means,
*Â«w arms, ne* pretexts are furnifhed to ambition ;
â¢lid sew perfonsare intoxicated with that poiion. Â°*
Bth, Because our eagerness in suing for peace J"
may induce the persons exercising power in France j,
â¢rroneoufly to believe, that we aft froiÂ» necessity, th
annate unaETe to continue the war, a penuafion,
which, in the event of an actual peace, will operate va
as a temptation to them to renew that condafi g <
vhicK Wrought on the prefeot war; neither Siall hi
ve have a*y of the usual fecuitics in peace. In "
their ttejities, they do not acknowledge the obliga
tion of that law which for ages bar been cemftion gr
to'all Europe. They have not the fame sentiments le
por the fame ideas of their interest in the preset va-
tion of peace, which have hitherto influenced all
regular governments; they do not in the fame w
wanner feel public distress, or the private misery of
theii fiibjffts ; they will not find the fame difficulty ti
on the commencement of anew war to call their tc
whole fbrfre into fad den action, where, by the law,
â¢very citizen iaa soldier, and the persons and pro- o
perty of all are liable at once to arbitrary requifi ,r
tions. On other hand, no attempt has been
made to (hew in what manner, whether by alii c '
â nces, by force, military or naval, or by the im- '
jprbvement and augmentation of our finances, we
stall be better able to refill their hollile attempts Â«>
after the peace than at jhe present hour. If we
Temaiti we cannot reap the ordinary advan t(
tagif of peace in economy ; If we disarm, we shall C
be fubjeft to be driven into a new war, under every
cireumftance of disadvantage, unless we now pte-
pare ourselves to fuffer, with patience and fubmif-
6on, whatever insults, indignities, and injuties we \
jnay receive from tkat insolent, domineering, atid
unjtift power.
9th, Because the inability of humbling ourselves ,
again to solicit peace in a ftianfier, which is a recog ] 1
filiation t>t the Ftench republic, contrary to alt j j
k Â» the principles of the war, the danger of peace, if I ,
obtained, the improbability of its Juration, and the ! j
perfcverance of the enemy throughout the interval
of peace in their mifchitVous system, is not corjqc-
ture, but certainty. It has been avowed by the (
adual governors of France at the very mbment they 1
bad before them our application for a pafTport. 1
They chose that moment for publishing a Rate pa- !
per; breathing the most hoflile mind. In it they 1
Simulate and gnad us, by language the mod op
probrious and offenfivtj. They frankly tell us, that |
it is not our interest to desire peace, for that they (
regard peace only a* the opportunity for preparing i
frtih means for the annihilation of our naval power. 1
By making peace they do not conceal that it will \
be their ofcjeAâ" to wrest from us our Maritime
preponderancyâto re-eflablifh what they invidious- <
ly call the freedom of the seasâto give a new im- '

with " unjustly attacking, when we can no longer
dupe," tnd which they throughout contemplate as <
their own dependencies, united in arms, and fur- 1

oftly been aoW to leave him forces too inadequate to controal
