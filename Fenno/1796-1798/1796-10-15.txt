A FEW comments on T. Jefferfon't very ridi
culous and elaborate attempt to that the
' ncgrots art an inferior rait of animals, will place in
a just light the philtjophical merits of the aathor :
3 The /arxgoing paflage has been felefted because it
it among those which have been mod admired by
the author's friends.
Firll we sbferve an affected anxiety to emanci
pate the negroes of Virginia, why, " in order to
vindicate the liberty of the human race;" but this
commendable zeal prffently yields to a more inte
-5 . resting anxiety " to preferye the b;auly of the hu
man race."
0 To extricate himfelf from the embarraffmsnt in
-0 tc which he is thrown by the confliSing desires of
0 " vindicating the liberty of the human race," and
" prefervifig its beauty," he hits on the notable ex
pedient of emancipatiHg all the slaves of Virginia,
and then inilantly fhippttig them off, like a herd of
black cattle, the Loriknows where. The desire
of preserving the beauty of the human race pre
j dominates, however, in the mind of our philofu
-8 pher j for notwithllanding the Dave* are to enjoy a
4 momentary freedom, they arc fuddenlv after to be
seized, bound, packed on board vefiels, andagainll
their consent exported to fÂ»Me less friendly regions,
where they might be all murdered or redaced to a
3 more wretched (late of flavery.âSoch are the noÂ»
7 ble and enlarged views of philosophical politicians!
4 But some juftificatinn mult be given for the latter
. part of this emancipatiag and merciful project :
It was neceflary therefore to prove thtt the blacks,
(whose emancipation was requiSte to vindicate the
liberty of the human race,) were not in faÂ«t of the ,
hufnan rttee, for N this must be the author's meaaing,
' if there be any meaning in his work, for the idea
5 of two or more human races, a black human race, 1
and a white human race, is too abfuid even for
1 him to have suggested ;it is tme his exprefliensare '
1 so vague and contradi&ory that it is difficult to
t ascertain very precisely his meaning, but taking
t the whole together, it results in thu, that the i
> blacks are a peculiar race of animals below man and 1
above the eran outang, a kind of tertium quid, a 1
( high kind of btute, hitherto undefcribed. I am
3 at a loss to annex any other rcfult to the following '
expressions and observations, viz.â" The real dif
; tinftions which natare has made"âa difference in '
' ' the two races"âcomparing the preference which 1
the blacks have for the whites to the preference of 1
; the or an outang for the black womenâsecreting less 1
t by the kidnies, and more by the glands of the 1
skin than the \vh'itesâdifference of ftrudtifre in the '
\ pulmonary apparatusâbeing in reason much infe- '
rior to the whitesâ-different species of the Amt
t genus, or varieties of the fame fpeciee---their ex
-3 iHence participating more of sensation than .reflec
-5 tionâgradations in the different races of animals.
The confulion of ideas which pervaded the un
-1 derftanding of our author through the whole of
this very ingenious and learned dissertation mult be
manifeft. At one moment he is anxious to eman
cipate the blacks, to vindicate the liberty of the
human raceâat another he difcoÂ«ers that the hlarks
are of a different race ftom the human race, and
; therefore when emancipated they must be inilantly
removed beyond the reach of mixture, lead he (or
! (he) should Jlain the blood of his (or her) mailer,
not recoile&ing what from his situation and other
; circumstances he ought to have recollectedâthat
; this mixture, may take place, while the negro re
j mains in slavery : he mud have seen all around him
> fufficient mirks of this flaining of blcod to have
' been convinced that retaining them in slavery would
not prevent it, and he must have been that
, the mixture would not be the less degrading from
r the emancipated late of the black. At another
moment he discovers that the blacks are indeed a
! part of the race, but than they are a differ
ent species of the fame genus, or they and the
j whites constitute varieties of the fame species. In
> one ptace he asserts with confidence " that thc-y
are in reason mucfc inferior to the whites jn ana
} ther he seems to'doubt it ;â¢" this difference of co
lour and perhaps of faculty;" to jnftify the eman.
ci pat ion of the blacks, they are made a part of the
human race, to jullify their emancipation, they are
classed with the brutes.
f But the molt extraordinary of all the felf con*
traductions of this phitofopltcr is found in a letter
; ! written, while secretary of Hate, to a negro named
t . Benjamin Banneier, which letter having a dose re
' lation to this fubjsdt may very propeily be here
introduced.
> We have seen from the above quotations that our
author was decidedly of opinionâj ft That there
t was a fixed difference in nature between the whites
1 and blackbâad That this amounted td a diftinfti
on, conllituting the blacks a different raceâ3d That
, the blacks were in reason much inferior to the whites,
r their existence participating more of sensation than '
' reflexionâ4th That this inferiority was evidently '
not produced by their condition, but by nature.
( The negro Benjamin was the reputed author of
( an Almanac, which was either dedicated to or sent,
with forae complimentary epistle, to his brother
author, our philosopher, whose philosophy was of
so pliant a quality that, ioltantly forgetting all his
â¢ learned discoveries on the skin and f?arf skin and 1
kidnies of ths unsavory Afiicans he fat down and
wrote to brother Benjamin a fraternizing epistle, in '
which he rejoices to find that nature has given to
his black brethren talents equal to those of other co
lours, and that the appearance of a want of them,
is owing merely to the degradedcondition of their ex
, iftence, both in Africa and Ameiica." He then
adds his wifhe* for the speedy emancipation of the i
negroes in the United States, asfaft as circumstances 1
will admit. Here we find a direS and flat contra- c
diaion to all his assertions ob this fubjeft in his Notes;
from which we must infer, either that that work a
was compiled with so much inaccuracy, and such t
want of information or refleflion, that the mofttri- t
vial circumstance was fufficient to induce him so t
contradict irÂ» contents himfelf, or that.he was so I
influenced by a ridiculous vanity, so tickled by a a
filly compliment'from an unsavory animal of an in- r
, fertor race, as wilfully and publicly to contradict,
without any (hame or regard to public dcccncy, his t
i.l former afferrions, ft ill believing them to he we!!
founded. Hi 3 panegyrist may chobfe from the a
bove alternatives, that which maybe the leail inju
rious to his friend. He will probably attempt to
i- vindicate the philosopher by introducing his canior
ie Avhich led hire to recant an error. The wonderful
in produ&ion of Brother Benjartiin, he will fay> has
â¢; convinced him of the untruth of his former do&riije.
it But this apology will not do ; bceaafe the Aotes on
iy Virginia prove our philosopher had fcen the
â¢ -uted works of other lilaeks, at leafl equal in
n'trit to Brother Benjamin's, and had fuggelled,
to that they were the production of fame white person,
is falfelf attributed to the negro. He had fully con
e- fidered and discussed this fubjeft : this appears from
j. the preseding quotations; but to leave no room for
doubt on this point, a further quotation (hall be in
n. ferted. Our author, hi his great zeal to support
as his doctrine of the inferiority of the race of the blacks,
id proceeds thus to the proof : " Thejr are in reason
c- much inferior to the whites; as, 1 think, one could
a, fearcely be found capable of tracing and compre
){ hending the ir.veftigatiorts <if Etidid ; in intagina
â¢c tion, rhey are dull, tasteless and anomalotis. Many

ie arc cultivated to a considerable degree, and had

8) of the mod sublime oratory, such as prove their
e reason and sentiment strong, their imagination
e glowing and elevated : but never yet could I find,
r, that nblaci had ujtercd a thought above the level of
( plain narrationânever fee even an elementary trait
â¢ t of painting and sculpture. Leve is the peculiar
, r ostrum of the poet : their love is ardent; but it
e kindles \hc sense only, not the imagination. Reli
-0 gionj indeed, has produced a Phillis IVhsdtly, but
g it could not produce a poet. The compolltions
c published under her name, are below the dignity of
d criticism. Ignatius Sanchi has approached nearer
â to msnt in his compoiition : Though we admit him
n the firft place among thofc of his own colour, who
g have presented thenafelvcs to the public judgment;
yet, when we compare him with the writers of the
i, race among wh6m he lived, and particularly with
h 'he epistolary class, iji which he has taken his own
(land, we ate compelled to enroll him at the bottom
"s <f the column. This o*iticifm supposes the letters
c published under his name, to be genuine, and to
e have recttved amendment from no other hand, points
.. which â¢wou'd not he easy of invejfigation, (furpiifing
t the fame refieftiotis did not oqctir refpefting BeiÂ«ja

- blacks, in body and mind, in thefiifl injlance of their
mixture with the whites, has been observed by every
. one, and proves, that their inferiority is not the rffeft

PARIS, August 19. ol
There have been new diflurbances at Geneva. The two ] u
parties ihere have been contending so long that there was e
\ery reason to dread the effufion of blood. An infurreftion n
wasdevifed, of which these parties reciprocally accused each o
other. Nine of the agents of Ariftoeracy are, however in p
euftody on (peciHe charges. The alarm bell being founded, _
both parties diew up under arrni, but as neither offered to ,
attack, tranquility was soon reflored. It is feared that the
trial of the aciufed parties may bring back new troubles.
The momentary reverses which we have experienced in
Itaiy have been nfeful in one they have displayed the
cunning and falfehood of those who at one time appealed to
cur generofuy, but who would certainly have betrayed us, if
the fuccefsof Wur refer could have given them a durable im

Mr. Fenno,
THE paper wliith has been pubhthed in the
Gazettes, purporting to be an official note from
the French minister lor foreign affairs, to M. Bar
thelemy, seems to excited much alarm among
the merchanu concerned in trade with the British
dominion). Whether note is authentic or not,

there exists no such older of the British govern-
ment, as the note represents to have been just giv-
en, and which is dated aj the immediate cause and
juliifieation of the resolution of the directory K te-
Ipifling neutral vessels.

John Wilkes Kittera, Esq. is re-c!eAcd member of j.

It has been induftriotifly circulated in the Country Is

fall ia the price of grain, are mere fabrications, the t|

There were several European arrivals yesterday;
but none of them can bring us any ntwi except the
brig Bollon, Capt. Curlis, from Hamburg in 41 and
Falmouth 24 days, and the fehooner Abeona, Captain f
Ropes, in 36 days from Cadiz. ' |j
By the Boflon we hope to get Hamburg papers this v
morning. Her verbal aceounts and letters corroborate
'our Dutch accounts in yefterday'j Argus, that Jourdan c
had defeated the Imperialists between Neurenberg and
Regenlburg, 'as we had it yesterday ; [We find on d
examination, that Regenfburg is the German for Ra- c
tifbon.] r
Verbal accounts by the Abeona, from Cadiz, state,
thatrhe British sailors had been permitted to return on
board their vefTels again, on,the day (he left that port, '
viz. the 4th September. '

There is a brilliaÂ»cy in military atchievsmentt
that dar.zlea the eye, and blinds it to other prof- c
pedis- Thus, while we are astonished at the heroic 1
aftiens of the Freqch, we are apt to overlook the 1'
real efftfts of their principles on therofelvcrand on
other nations. We arc apt to Overlook the diffo- t
lute (late of morals, the total conuption as man- a
ners that pervade all their large cities; their neglect c
of arts ?nd science ; their violation of rights and c
property ; their internal fa&ions, which, in some 1
parts, are constantly (hedding blood ; their mur 1
ders and affaffinationi; their robbing and plunder- '
ing shipwrecked seamenâand especially their viola- 1
lion Â®f the neutral rights of peaceable nations, and '
their dictatorial iiifolenee to Holland, Geneva, and '
other independent Rates.
What fife could be expc&ed ?âThefe are the 1
inevitable confequenees of the atheistical tenets 1
I which arc imbibed even by the common citizens. '
i An intelligent gentlemen, who cannot be fufpec- '
1 ted of enmity to France, and who has lately return- '
â¢ cd from a tour through that country, informs, that >

f cially among the young people, that astonished '

1 <womenf absorb all their attentionâThat the cities
are finks of corruptionâThat their famous national ]
institute is contemptibleâfar infetior to the poorest !
' of the Ametican colleges. 1
Of the total want of morals in that country, we '
