HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, May 21.
Mr. Havens prefentcd an address from
Suffolk county, in the slate of New-York,
depri-acing war as the woiic of evils, and
praying that merchant's veflels may not be
permitted to arm,but that every means maybe
ofed for the prefervaiion of peace with the
French Republic. Referred as irfual.
?ylr. Skinner asked and obtained leave of
absence for three weeks.
The bill refpe&ing loan office certificates
and final fettletnent certificates, indents ofin
tereftÂ» and the unfunded or regiftfcreu debt
credited on the books of the treasury, was
reaÂ«Lthe third time and paflcd.
Mr. Varnum, from the committee on
poft-offices and post-roads, to whom was re*
committed a former report, reported a bill in
addition to theadt for eitablilhing poft-offices
and post-roads, which was committed for
Monday.
Mr. Bayard said, he had a refoluticn to
offer to the house, which he trusted would
meet with no opposition from any quarter. It
was intended solely to explain the grounds
upon which the house proceeded when they
refufed to consent that Mr. Pinckney should
receive the presents usually made by foreign
courts to ministers upon taking leave, and
which had been offered to him by the courts
of London and Madrid. He had pUrposely
avoided in the resolution, any exprefiion of
approbation of the conduct of Mr. Pinckney
during his millions, because he perfectly
knew that no approbation of that house could
add to the Iwgh sense the people of the United
Stares already entertained of the integrity and
talents of that gentleman ; and becanfe it did
not belong to the occasion, for the house to
exprels any opinion as to the conduct of the
gentleman during the time he was employed
abroad. That the design of thejcfolution he
had tofubmit, was simply to negative an an- i
plication that polllbly might be made, that as
the confiitution certainly did contefjiplate
cases in which ministers might be allowed to
receive prefects, that the house were induced
by reasons connected with the conduct of this
gentleman, to refufethe liberty to accept the
presents ; whereas he was perfectly fatisfieu,
from the declarations of gentlemen who op
posed the permiflton, who had all taken occa
sion to teftity much esteem for the character
and entire approbation of the condutt of Mr.
Pinckney wiiile iaoffice, that their opposition
arose from principlesofgeneral policy, which
led them to think that in no cafe should pre
sents be allowed so be received. Nay they
had said, that the purity of this gentleman's
character, and the importance of his services
furnifhed a happy opportunity of establishing
an invariable rule precluding the acceptance
of these presents, which no merit hereafter
should induce the house to depart from. The
subject, however, was of so delicate and ten
der a nature, that he conceived it a piece of
jtiftice on the part of the house, to state ex
plicitly the grounds upon which their deci
sion was made in order to preclude the polli
bility of any mi (take as to their motfves. He
should rely, therefore, with yerfeft confidence
that the following resolution would be una
nimously adopted :
â¦' Resolved, that this bonfe, in refusing to al
low Thomas Pinckney, late minister at the court
of London, and envoy extraordinary to the court
.of Madrid, to receive the presents usually made
by the said courts to foreign ministers on taking
leave, <zuere induced to such refujal solely by mo
tives of general policy, and not by any vieiv
personal to the said Thomas Pinckney."
Mr. Grjswold moved the poftponment
of this resolution till to-morrow.
.The question on poftponment was put and
negatived 41 to 34.
The question on agreeing to the resolution
then returned.
Mr. Sew all had some doubts as to the
propriety oÂ» the determination of tke general
question, as he believed by, that determina
tion, the house had parted with an advantage
placed in them by the conlbtution. He tho't
the best way of fettling tbis btifinefs would be
to re-consider that queftiou. He knew one
gentleman who had voted upon it thro* mi in
take, and there might be several others in the
fame situation.
The question on agreeing to the resolution
was put and carried unanimously. /
On motioa of Mr. Sewall, the house
went into a committee of the whole on the
bill fnppiementary to, and to amend the act to
establish an uniform rule of naturalization,
and to repeal the aÂ£t heretofore paftedon that
subject.
Sewall movetj to.fill the blai^c(pacifying
the length of time neceflary foi an alien to
give notice of hiÂ§..intentiou to become a citi
zen, before he can be admitted, with five
years.âCarried.
The blank the length of time ne
ceJl~ary for an alien to reside here before he can
be admitted a citizen, Mr. Sewall moved
to -fill with fourteen years.
Mr. M'Dowell hoped this blank would
not be filled with so long a time. The reli
dence now required from foreigners before
they can become citizens is five years. He
would not object to an increase of the length
of this term to seven years; or if the commit
tee rhought nine better, he would not object
to \l. He did not wish to discourage an emi
gration so this country of respectable. foreign
ers, by barring them from the rights of citi
zenfliip. The policy ofthi? country had al
ways been different, and he did not wish en
tirely to change it. When persons come here
from foreign countries, it was our he
laid, to attach them to us, and not always to
look upon them as aliens and Grangers.
The <|ue(KoÃ for filling the blank with 14
was put and carried 41 to 40.
Mr. Sewali. moved a clause providing
that no alien, who comes from a country at
war with us, fliaH be admitted to citizenship
whilst such war continues.âAgreed.
Mr* Gallatin wiihed to know whether
he provilions of this aCI are intended to ex
end to persons nho were in this country pre
vious to the parting of rhe law of January,
I ?9SÂ» which requires a residence of five jears
before an alien can become a citizen, but who
have neglected to become,citizens, as well as
to all those aliens who have come to this
country since January, 1795, although they
may have made the declaration by that law
required, three years before they can become
so, ot their intention of becoming citizens of
the United States. The hw of Jan, 1795, had
made an exception in favor of all aliens then
in the country.
As the bill Hands at present, Mr. G. said,
it would have a rerrofpective eflfeCt on three
defcriptiens of persons, v;z. all these
who were in tiiis country prior to the adop
tion of the present constitution of the United
States and who were not naturalized under
the state laws before the atl of 1790 ; in
the next place it afteCts all those who under
the law of 1790 might have been naturalized,
and all those who, under the the law of 1795,
might hereafter be naturalized, provided they
have made the neceflary declaration of their
inten;ion of becoming citizens. From the
year 1795, Mr. G. laid, many persons, with a
view of making themselves citizens of this
country as soon as the law would allow them,
have renounced their allegiance to the coun
tries from whence they came, and if this bill
paires in its present form, they will for ten or
t.velve years to come be withoutcitizeufliip
in any Country. He hoped, therefore, some
exception would be made in favour ot the de
scriptions of persons which he had named.
âOne which led him to mention this
circumstance was, that there are a great num
ber of persons in the state ot' Pennfyivaiiia,
and many in thediftrict from whence he
who, though they are not citizens of the U1 i
ted States, really believe they are. This mis
take has arisen from, (an error common to
most of the diftricls of the United States) a
belief that an alien's being naturalized by the
laws of a state government/ since the act of
1790, made him a citizen of the United States.
The Mayer of thiscity till the year 1795,
admitted citizens under the state law, whoaf
terwards considered themselves as citizens of,
the United States. He (Mr. G.) always
thought that conftruttion to be wrong, Con
gress having the power to pass, and having
pasTed an uniform naturalization law, which,
:n his opinion excluded the idea of admifiion
to citizenship on ditferent terms, by the indi
vidual states. But he knew the contrary o
pinion, till lately, generally prevailed. In
deed he knew that at the late election in this
city, the votes of respeCtable merchants, who
had obtained American registers for their ves
sels, on a presumption of their being Citizens,
were refuted on this ground- The famemif
take had extended to other parts of the union.
It may be said, that since the year 1795, these
persons might have gone to any of the courts
and have become citizens. In this city, and
in others, he supposed persons had generally
done so ; but w here people are 2or 300 miles
diiiant from the distriCt court of the United
States, they had not always an opportunity of
doing it, especially on account of a construc
tion of the aCt of 1795, which had prevailed
in some counties of Pennsylvania, and which
made ;it doubtful whether any court in the
state, out of/he city could adminifterthe oath
ot citizenship. Mr. G. supposed that since
the year 1790, from 10 to 15,000 emigrants
had come int? the state of Pennsylvania, two
thirds of whom believed, till lately, that they
were citizens of the United States, from their
having been naturalized by the laws of that
state. It has now been discovered that they
are not citizens ; but since that discovery
was made/ they have not had an opportunity
of being admitted according to the law of the
United States. If some limitted period was
given to these perfont to come forward to be
naturalized, and they did not become citizens
in that time, he Ihould be willing to exclude
them. He thought, indeed, provision should
be made for all thele persons ; but he would
not move any amendment until he had heard
! the opinion of the committee on the subject.
The amendment just adopted, for excluding
alien enemies from citizenfirp, would do away
any objection which could be urged against a
provision of this kind. Indeed the persons
lie alluded to, generally came from the ter
ritories of .the king ot Great Britain, and three
fourths oGhetn from Ireland.
Mr. faid, this subject was before
the Select Committee, and it was the opinion
of a majority of that committee that no excep
tion ought to be made, but that the bill should
pass in its present torin. Hisown sentiments,
lie -said, were decidedly againlt any alteration.
As to the irifbmqn whom the gentleman from
Pennsylvania has mentioned, as they have
neglected to avail themfelvs of the privilege
of becoming citizens, he supposed they aid
not place any high value upon it. They are
now permitted to hold lands ; and from the
present t>i&racted shite of the country* from
whence they have emigrated, heaiid notihink
it would be prudent to make them eligible to
hold feats in the Government, after a resi
dence ot five years. He believed the
liberty which the United States have given in
thisrefpect heretofore has been unexampled,
and it was high time the evils which had ari
sen from this imprudent liberality, ihould be
remedied. The present difiracted state of
he world, and the attempts made to diflurt)
other governments, she wed the neceftity of
the pTopofed regulations. Mr. S. did not
confiderthe persons who bad been mentioned,
as labouring under any disadvantages. Con
sidering what they have left, and wUat they
receive here, their situation is vastly improv
ed by the chauge which they have made,
without giving them any chance of becdmirfg
Members of our Government, for they would
have ftad little chance of becoming members
of the government which they have left. He
did not /uppofe they came here with a view
of getting into the Government, but to ac
quire property, and to enjoy peace and hap
piness, aud this they might do, independent
of citizenship. Ashe saw no good, there
fore, to be derived to the country, froyi ad
mitting these persons to citizenship, but much
danger, he hoped the bill would be agreed
to as reported.
Mr. Gallatin said, if the bill was pro
ceeded with, he would prepare an amend
ment in favour of those classes of persons he
had mentioned.
The bill was accordingly proceeded with ;
and coming to the sth seCtion, where it. is
provided, that if an Alien shall continue to
refwie here, and shall refufe or neglect to
make a report of his residence, and receive a
certificate thereof, shall forfeit two dollars,
and shall be liable to be arrefled as a ftfpeeled
person,
Mr. Gallatin moved to strike out the
words printed in italic. It was fiitficient, he
said, that filch a person should pay a fine. It
was a new filing to punish a man by impri
sonment not for delinquency, but because he
was fufpetied. A conduct ot this kind had
been highly condemned in another country,
and he fu>*ted it would not be auoptec^here.
Mr. S'lWATti said, it was the intention of
! the committee: to fliew the nature of th e of
fence of omitting to make the proper report ââ 
to (hew that fitch omvffton vvgcld lay me ci-â¢
zens under the suspicion of not ailing open
ly and candidly.
Mr. Sitc reaves remarked, that if his
colleague's objection only went to the words
fufpcclcd per/on, Jlis motion went too far.
The queition was put and negatived 37 to
3 6 -
Mr. Gallatin then proposed an amend
ment to the following efTect, 4< provided
that any Alien who Was resident within the
limits, and under the jtirifdicHon of.the Uni
ted States be lore the 29th of January, 1795,
and any Alien who (hall have made a decla
ration ot hisiijtention of becoming a citizen
of .the United States, in conformity to the
provisions of an nil eftablilhing an uniform
rule of Naturalization palled on that day, may
to become citizens of the United
State*, according to the provisions of that
ad."
, Mr. Craik. was disposed to go much far
ther than is proposed by this bill in restrict
ing Aliens from becoming citizens of this
country. He {hould have no objection to fay,
i that no foreigner conunc into tins country af
| ter tiy.s time, lhail ever become a citizen;
I but he believed it this law was to have a re
| trofpective operation on all thole foreigners
| novf t'efiding v iihin the United States, who
have neglected _to become citizens, it would
be very unjulr. 'JT.er< was a large clafv of
persons, he laid, in the -country irotn which
lie came, who are not 11.1!uralized underlay
law, and many others who.had been natura T
â¢i zed tinder the State law ; about the legality
of which, as had been {fatal, there is.mucu
doubt, though in Maryland and Virginia,
foreigners are (till naturalized by the States,
notwithuanding the law of the United States.
In deciding upon this queftioi*, Mr. C.
said, it would not be proper to take inty con
sideration emigrants from any particular coun
try. Many of the perlons he ailuded to, are
Germans, and well entitled to every privi
lege that can be given them, a.id whose neg
lect to become citizens was probably owing *
to the'u - ignorance of our language and laws.
He (hould, therefore, be in lav our of this a
mendment, efpeciaUy as saras ittefpects't I}ofe
Aliens who were in this -country before the
year 1795. .
Mr. Bayard said, though foreigners were
prevented from becoming citizens of the U
nited States, until they have reiided 14. years
in the country, in many of the ttates, they
are entitled not only to vole for filling
of the State Governments, but also for filling
those of the United States. Therefore, the
only privilege which they are denied, :s the
capacity of becoming Members of the Fede
ral Government, which was a denial, he
thought recommended by found policy. And
he did not fee why the reltriction fliouli not
extend as well to the Aliens now within
the United States, as those who (hall hereaf
ter come here. It aliens residing here had a
ny right to expect an exception, it mull be
on the ground of compact. He did not, how
ever, consider Naturalization Laws in that
light. Aliens cannot be considered as mem
bers of thefocietyof the United Stales ; our
laws are pa(Ted on the ground of our own po
licy, and whatever is granted to Aliens is a
mere matter of favour, and if it is taken
away, they have no right to complain. Every
principle of policy in his opinion, required
this regulation to be inade general ; for he
believed there were as many Jacobins and
Vagabonds come into the United States du
ring the last two years, as may come for ten .
years hence ; fothat these very perlons agunft
whom this law was intended to operate, vt ill
become citizens, and may be chofea into
the Government. He hoped, therefore, the
amendment would not be adopted.
With refpeÂ£t to those persons who have gi
ven notice 0/ their intention of renouncing
their allegiance to the foreign country from
whence they came (for they do not actually
renounce it until they become citizens) it can
make no difference to thorn, clpeciaiiy those
referred to by the gentleman from Pcninfyl
vania, because it is a principle of the Brkiflt
Law, that Britiih (objects have not a right to
alienate thenifelves âthey cannot renouoce
their Allegiance to the Brituh K.iuÂ£. No ob
jection, therefore, could lit; agalnii the mea
lurcs being general on t.'uit ground.
Mr. Macon was aj>preheÂ»five that gen
tlemen in their zeal to get at particular per
sons, will go too far in this business. He agreed
with them, that for three or four years part,
people of all forts of pulit .es had come to tb*s
country, from tlie lugheft driflocrat to the
greateir Jacobin ; and he doubted not that per
lons who were -very deiirous of becoming ci
tizens, or who had any particular end to an
swer by it, had already availed theuitelves of
the law. But there are pcrlonf indi&ant parts
of the continent, \\ ho have never yet become
citizens, perhaps from their not being in- the
way of going through the ceremony, and be
cause he had no apprehension cf the privilege
b 'ing taken from them. Many had alio omit
ted to do it from an ignorance of our ianguage-
He hoped, therefore, this amendment would,
be agreed to. If perlons have given notice of
their intention to become citizens, they have
complied in part with the laws; and he did
not think it would be r.ght to put it out of
their power to comply with the other part.
Mr. Sew all fai .this amendment would
comprehend those Alrens v, ho have come here
11 nee the year 1795, though they may have
made no declaration of their intention to
become citizens, as they may make the deco
ration la v patfcs. As to the other
description. of persons, he had the laaie
objection to them. He agreed with the gen
tleman troki Delaware, .that o*:r regulations
in this respect, are made for our ov\:i # conve
nience and farcty, and that no Alien has a
right 10 complain, t these regulations iliould
disappoint his expectations.
Mr. Sitcreaves said. this was either a
qneftion of right, or cxped oncy. He presu
med no gentleman was prepared t6 f*v any
Alien had acquired an abfotiKe and positive
right in this country, to cinzenfbip at any par
ticular time. If not, it was a mere matter of
expediency ; and v.hen :t is ccnlidered
in this light, there can fee litfTe diifieul
tv in feeing the dangers and disadvanta
ges which would a rife frain allowing foreign
ers to become citizensas heretofore, or as pro
posed by the prilent amendment. They are
too evident to be enumerated".
But it vvasfuppcicd that there arc a
hnmberof individuuH *Â»h fh'?s couutrv, enjtu-

. if this were so, tlwt perlons Ihould tor so long
. a time have negleited ta embrace a right,
which'it is now woi>W bÂ«<fttiiÂ»g
them great injury to depri'Â®t thetjt of! As to
ihofe persons who Came into the Country (ince
the law of 1795, he saw no good realon for
making an exceptien in their favour. As Po
licy, Safety and Security dirtated the measure,
he hoped the bill would be paired us reported.
Mr. W. Claiborxe said he could not
reconcile it to his feelings to vote far the bill
without the amendment propoled by the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania, beca ife it would
be doing a number of people whom he repre
sented, the gfeateft injustice. Those people,
hefa ; d, were peculiarly lituated. It was only
at the lall winter feflton that the State of Ten
helTee was reiirelented on this floor j and at the'
tune of palling the Naturalization Law the
people of that country were not in a situation
to receive information x>f what was done in
Congress It need not be a rnattcrot fufprize
therefore, if in th.it frontier country, there are
many persons, not take advan
tageof the law of 1790. There afe numbers of
such who have givÂ«n the ffrortgeft proofs of
attachment to the
and bled ofthe United State.s,
Â»nd are as much wedded to the Government
of the United States as any men born on Ame
rican foil. If this amendment does not pre
vail, it will afi'eiSt many valuable citizens of
the llate of Tettnelfee, .who wefe citizens in
the year 1795, and ten years before ,tl*t time.
These persons would be deprived of rights,
because they were living in a country to whicli
there was no polt road, and where of course
they had no Newspapers to give them infor
mation of what was going on as the feat of
Government: He hopfcd therefore it would .
(lot be agreed to.
Mr. j. hoped this provision '
wonfd.be agreed to; When an ait is palled
good reason, he said, ought to be given be ore 1
any change fakes place. Many persons had I
tome into the country from an expectation of f
being naturalized at the end of a certain peri- t
bd 1 but, if this provilion isnot agreed to, the c
system will be entirely changed. He fa"/ no L
difficulty which could arite from agreeing to c
this provilion, as persons from countries at a
war with this cauntry, could not be made citi- 0
lens at all. Heknewa number of persons who I p
bad not taken advantage of the NatUralizati- ii

that by thclawsofthe fevcral (fates Aliens are
allowed to hold land ; but wlrn foreigners w

The queflion was put and carried, there ti
being 52 votes for it. ni
The committee then rose, and the house i t
proceeded to take up the amendments. f\:
The amendment of Mr. Ga llatjn com- pi
ing again under CMilideration,
Mr. Coit hoped that part of the clatife al
would be disagreed to, which embraces per
sons who were in this country before the year tii
179,5, but who had never (hewn anydifpofi- w
tiuu to become citizens. Those who came w
since, and had given notice of their intentions
01 becoming citizens, Hand on very different w
ground. He should have 110 objection to the bi
luttcr being accepted in the way proposed, fli
but not the former. a s
After a few oblervations on this amendment th
it was negatived 49 to 31.
Mr. Sjtcrkavcs proposed an amend- pr
ment, limitting the time within which aliens nit
included in Mr. Gallatin's proposition, should tin
be permitted Wavail themfeives of the ex- (in
teption in their favour, viz. those who were ful
in this cou try before the year 1795, within we

notice of their intention to become citizens, tin
within four years from the time of such no- ]
ticc having been given. nle
ihe quelfion vvas firft put on the former poi
part of tile amendment.
Mr. T. Ct.AiBORKE did not wish to pu- (ao
nifh men for not being born here, but to pu- - Â°
nifh both natives and foreigners when guilty. 1
He hoped two yea.-s would be allowed, inffead !
of one. Sta
â¢ The question oh two years, was pnt and ne- ing
gatived 31 to 39. It was then put on one, and it Â«
carried, 57 votes being forit.
The qtK.fion on the second part of the
amendment was then put. nle!
Mr. Varncm (aid, the impulfeof the mo- - t^el
,mÂ«tit led members to believe that these re- Â°co
ftri6fmns upon foreigners were necedary. He di fc
thought there was no neceflity for any mea- fort
fures being taken with rfefpeft to foreigners, f erv
e.tcept such as belong to the nation with r
â vhom wc expert to be at war ; yet he had no 'Â° re
â¢ particular objecfion to reftriCfions being made Â° e a
with refpett to such foreigners as (hall here. "
sfter come to thiscountry ; but, having here- sent
tofore held out inducements to foreigners to raise

come; with an expectation of becoming enti
tUd tti the rights of citizens in a cfcrfain time, rÂ° m
he would not disappoint those expectations. " v ?
Mr. T. C i.a IBoÃtrr. said this was a very
important bill, and he should wifli a little and
more time to conlider of it; he therefore the j
mbved an adjournment. Stati
The motion was put and negatived, bein"

Mr.Sitcreaves said, theobfervationsof **s

it, and the resolutions were ordered to lie upon 1

Your opinion, that war with all its attendant ,n ? r
diflrcfljs is far to a surrender of our Ra

Americans; but our fltuation is such, that a sur
render of our independence to those who afTuil it,
would only more furcly involve us in the wont 1
war that could fall to our lot.

Yciir approbation of the cbndua of the

under the guidance of the Supreme IKfpofer, '<
by the united valoV, constancy and exertions

GENOA, Mr.rch jq, i
A treaty of alliance and- commerce is on thev (
tapis between thc Ftensh republic ami tile Ligii- ;
nan. There is little doubt, ihat it will be made <
conformable to the principles which have pre- v
dominated in the alliances of the French repnb
lie with the Baravian and Cisalpine republic?. J
It IS not probable that it will meet here the f., ,e 1
difficulties aÂ« that with this last Republic. It is f
relative to the opposition wheh general Berthier (
has encountered in this affair at Milan, th the t
has ilTued the following proclamation.
Head Quarters, Genoa, March 17, ,
A treaty of alliance with the Freneh republic ?
can alone assure you liberty ; and by eonfequence J
this is the lad blow flruck at tyranny. A great
treason was organized against your welfare,
Already we have difcovered'many threads of 4
that conspiracy: at the fatne time, they fought c
to excite the French a. my ag inft discipline, in o
order to How up troubles in vour departments :
Journahfts were paid to mifr'eprcft nt and insult "
the 1 icnch nation ; and yon know thai it is not
insulted with impunity. The counter-revolu- i<
tiomlti drove to let the French and Cifalpines to a
cutirg one another's throats. A deputy of the n
council of ancients (but, I speak it with pha- 1.
lure, a flranger to tl.o Cisalpine territory) or- r
gamzed a (edition, for delivering Mantua to thc ,
enemies of the Cisalpine republic: the traitors
in the pay of royalist powers, who furr und
von, are perhaps conceal, d in some of the mod
relpedlable authorities of your government. V
Other men, wholeintentions reufi be pnre.ferve, F
without wishing it, your enemi. s, either from k,
Want "f re-fle<f>io/Â» or from ignorance.
Cisalpine People, can you ever forget that C y
yon owe your liberty to the French blood,
which has besprinkled your country, to
the pains and facrifices of that Grande Na
tion, which is the admiration of the entire
universe. Yes, the French are your friends:
They will always be so: and they will
know how to carry on the work which they 5 '
have begun. te
In the orders which I have given for j
punilhing the counter-revolutionary and im
pi ndent jotirualills, who have spoken with >
irreverence of theJFrcnch nation ;in theac- '
cufation which I have called for against a r 3
reprcfentative of the people, traitor to his C
country and to the French army,âl have
refpetfed those principles of Liberty, which "
we have given you. when at the fame time
I might have employed the Military Au, Tl
