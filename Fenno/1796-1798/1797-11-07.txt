Governor, some of you are to be called on
to parade in honor of the President of the
United States! In thus honouring the firtt
roagiftrate of a free people, we honor our
selves. It is not necessary to enquire from
whence the power was derived, for issuing
this order. The Governor ie conftitution
aiiy, the commander in chief ; to the con
stitution he is amenable ; and ncirie but tray
tors arid parricides will question, oroppofe
his authority in this refpedL Like him we
are free men, and fubjeft to the laws and
the constitution ; but that ConttituJon has
given him a to command us, as a part
of the militia of the Rate. No friend to our
country will dispute that authority ; fncl\
opposition will be setting up an authority
unknown to the laws and the'conftitution,\
which is worse than to revert to a state of
nature.
The objeÂ£t of this order is to {hew our
refpe /t to a magistrate of our own electing,
our attachment to {he constitution of the
United States, and that the feat of govern
ment possesses equal patriotism with other
parts of the union, which have paid fiich dif
tinguillicd honours to the patriot whose pub
lic services meiit every acknowledgement of
a grateful people.
Are you not men, citizens, soldiers!
i Rave you not righss, privileges, property
and honor to defend ? Is not the constituti
on your own work ? Are not the magis
trates, the guardians of that constitution,
those rights and privileges yourown choic ?
At a mom 'lit when the demons of anarchy
<tnd confufion would lay every thing pros
trate, are not your countenance and sup
port necessary to encourage and animate your
public officers, to stand firm in the support
of that independence, peace, liberty and
fafety which the constitution was adopted
to secure ? Citizens, this is an honourable
teftitnony of your attachment to your gov
ernment. The wretchss who inculcate a
contrary do&rine, would make you Haves
inderd.
What has the President done, has been
afl<ed by a contemptible organ of the fafti
on ; that faction, which has done nothing
but degrade the country for the last /even
years. What has he doneâconsult the re
cords of a long and arduous life. A life
of labours for the public good. Consult
the written and printed annals of your coun
try. They are replete with testimonials of
the most important benefits evercoaferred by
a'nv individual on a country.
When the illustrious Waftiington was re
ceived with the civil and military honors of
the city, the fame parricidal arts were em
ployed to'arreft the noble and independent
testimonials of your attacfiment to the fa
ther of his country- but the efforts were
blastedâthey were vain. The head of the
fa&'oii funk abalhed.
It ie for the fonsof sedition and fa&ion
alone, to fay that they will spurn the or
ders of government ; full well have they
experienced the bitter effects of their anar
chical principles. May they continue to
drink deep of the cup of chagrin arid mor
tification. Believe it, fellow-citizens, your
honor, peace, liberty and property are se
cure, only in proportion as such persons are
without influence.
The service proposed, is a voluntary ser
vice. It can be grateful only on that idea.
Independent however of every other consi
deration it is a duty of policy. Philadel
phia, adds an honourable testimony to those
of the Eastern states, of her attachment to
the government, by paying public refpeft
to the President. She conciliates the good
opinion of the other members of the union ;
'and demonstrates that she is worthy the ho
nor and privilege of being the feat of gov

guiflied for their federalifm ; and it has
been her peculiar good fortune generally to
baffle the designs of that junto, whose efforts
â re perpetually diretted to her degradation.

NEW-YORK, Nov. 7.
Yesterday arrived here the ihip Mary,
Capt. Allen, in 45 d?.ys from London.
By this arrival we are furnilhcd with
LONDON PAPERS as late as the 18th
of September, from which the most im
portant ictelligence is extracted. '
A gentleman who came paffihger in
forms, that he saw a Loudon paper at
the? Downs, of the 20th Sept. in which
it was announced that the negotiations at
Lisle had been abruptly terminated, and
that Lord Malmcfoury was returned to
England re infeEla.
Phis eyent is rendered highly proba
ble by the tenor of our accounts of the
14th Sept. this day publilhedfrom
which it appears, that a categorical ati
fiver had been required of his Lordship
to the laji proportion. The purport cf
this propoiition we do not know ; but
it was probably one to which the Englilh
mini ft er had refufed previouflv to accede
âand as he is not of a character to be
dragooned into a compliance, we think
his return indubitable. (N.Y.Gaz.)
LONDON, Sept. 12.
We enter on the duty of detailing the ex
traordinary event that occurred on Monday
last in Paris, with emotions which it is not
easy to describe. It is a proceeding which
in every view, either of gigantic interest in
its confequeuces, or of audacious charafter
in its design, has scarcely a parallel since the j
commencement of the revolution itfclf, and
it is impoffibleto speak of it in the language
which applies to ordinary events. It may
be r.ffertfd that there are occasions in the po
litical as well as the physical combinations
of life, when all principles must yield, to im
perious necefiity, and when all the rules of
moral condutt are set at defiance. The ad
fniffiori of this axiom is all that the most !
odious tyranny demands for the juftification
of every excess ; and it is certain that it is
fufficient to take from the most fettled fo
cietv every assurance that it can frame for
its own independence 1 . With this Ihorl ob
servation, we preface the narrative of the
new revolution in France. We (hall faith
fully lay before our readera every thing that
the Triumvirate has said in juftification of
the measure it so secretly contrived, and vi
gorously carried into execution ; our read
ers will thereby be able to decide whether
the circumstances of the republic were such
as to create the pretended necefiity which
fupercedes all law ; or whether it was mere
ly a cabal of pcrfonal interests, in which a
struggle for ascendency is exalted into a
.ftioek for the deliverance of the people.â
The genuine friends of liberty iii every
country of the world, who are the steady
and impartial fpeftators of this astonishing.
r cene, and a severe posterity, free from all
the paflions which blind the performers, will
pronounce judgment on the aft. It for us
to furnifh the materials.
The blow was struck between three and
faur o'clock on Monday morning the 4th
September. The confufion of dates from
their new division of the year, made our cor
respondent call the 17th Frudtidor, the 4th,
when it ftwmld have been the 3d of Septem
ber. We yesterday morning received the
following letters up to the 21ft Frudtidor,
or Thursday last, the 17th inclusive.
Paris, 19 FruSidor, Sept. 5.
The explofio* has at last taken place.-
The events of yefterdey are of the greatest
importance. lam going to relate them in
order as they happened :
Duringthe night df the 17th, the com- ,
million of infpeftors, with several members ,
of both councils, had assembled in the hall 1
of 500 at the Thuilleries. At midnight 1
General Lemoine (others fay Moulin) ap- ]
peared at the gate of the Pont-tournant, ]
which leads into the garden of the Thuille- 1
ries fronj the square of the revolution, at
the head of a confidcrable detachment, and 1
demanded admittance, which was refufed <
him by Ramel, commander of the guard of 1
the legislative body. But upon the gene- '
ral's ordering two pieces of cannon to ad- '
vance, and the grenadiers at the fame time 1
declaring against their commrnder, the gate
was opened and Ramel arretted. The gen.
then proceeded to the Manege, where the
members' were deliberating, and found there
Rovere, Bourdon de l'Oife, Pichegrn, Wil
lot and several others, all of which he
immediately arretted. Pichegru and Willot
made some resistance, but were immcdi- t
ately fcized and disarmed ; and it is even t
said, that Pichegru is grievously wounded, f
At the fame time Barthelmy was arrested at
the Directory ; but Carnot had contrived to e
make his'efcape. ;
Before the execution of this blow, the i
Direftory had taken care to have all the c
bridges, the square of the revolution, the ,
avenues leading to the Thuilleries, and the :
mofl considerable posts of the city occupied
by strong detachments of troops, with canneii. c
In the mean while general Angereau re- t
paired to the barracks where'the grenadiers t
of the legidative body were quartered, and, <
having assembled them, alked them if they (
would follow him : to which they all an- t
fvvered with one voice Yes. They <hen de
manded to fee their ci-devant commander (
Ramel, and degraded him by pulling off his 1
epaulets, and then marched to offer their
services to the Direftory, c
The walls were covered with different pa- a
pers posted up by order of the Dilcttory ; e
copies of which you will find in the inclosed c
Reda<3eur.
At seven the arrested deputies were con- }i
veyed in fix or seven carriages to the temple, a
At 12, in consequence of an adverrife- p
merit, polled on" the doors of both cojiicils, (1
the council of jco aiicmbhd at the OJeon, t
the ancient French theatre near the di recta.
r y> and. the elders at the, fchpol.of Surgery,
not f ar f rorn thence.
The Fauxbourgb St. Antoine, well arm
ed, evidently by preconcert, came and of
, iered their serviceS to the direftory and both
councils. They were thanked, and invited
to repaid to their refpedtive occupations.â
before they returned home they drew up in
1 the Rucdes Francs Bourgeois, where gen.
â  Angereau pafild along the line, and was re
ceived with the loudest acclamations. They
afterwards retired very peaceably. â¢
During the whole day the bridges and
chief polls were guarded by the troops ;
the ftreetp, especially about the directory
and the councils, were crouded with incre
dible numbers of inquifitivt persons, who
seemed to be guided by no other motive
than curiosity. Not the lea!l outrage was
.an'd' the ntrnoft order and tran
â  quillity reigtied in e-very quarter of the city.
At 6 in the evening the directory an
swered the meflage of the council of five
hundred, by fending papers relative to the
conspiracy. [These papers we have already
mentioned.]
During the night the commission of five
made report on the measures to be adopted
in the present conjundture, and proposed a
projedt of a resolution, which you will find
in the Moniteur.
The only uncafinefs now entertained is
from the friends of the constitution of '93,
or if you will, the Mountaineers; but it is
affVired that the diredlory has positively re
fufed to join them.
The barriers still remain shut. It is pre
sumed that there are 12 or 15 thousand
troops at Paris, while all the issues from that
city are completely blocked up by 25,000
men, distributed around at the distance of
5 leagues, so that it is impossible for any
j person to escape.
No news hitherto of Carnot. Some fay
he has (hot himfelf, while others pretend he
was killed by some people who attempted
to arrest him.
It is now one o'clock. Every thing is
remarkably quiet.
From the Stnllnelle.â" One Perotteau, a
gun-smith, Rue Croix-des-prtits Champs, has
j been arretted. This villain has confeffed,
on his examination, that the royal commis
sioners of Louis XVIII. had purchased
from him 700 muskets, on bons, signed with
the initial letters R.. .e. The whole has
been seized and confifcated, and the proofs
and papers are now at the Bureau Central."
20 Frudtidor, Sept. 6.
Never since the beginning of the revolu
tion was a plan carried on with more cau
tion, or executed with more celerity, than
the famous measure taken by the diredlory
on the 18th infl. This will appear evident
to any person who considers that the majo
rity of the diredlory, while they were pre
paring every thing for such an important
blow, had to baffle the vigilance not only
of their colleagues, Carnot (a man of su
perior abilities) and Barthelemy, but also
to deceive the numerous spies employed by
their enemies in both councils. So great
was the secrecy with which all their mea
sures were concerted, that they had adlu
ally marched a considerable body of troops
(some fay 10,000 men) into Paris, sur
rounded that city on every fide at the dis
tance of 5 leagues, occupied every import
ant pott, and arretted their enemies, within
the space of two hours, without any one's
having had previously the least suspicion of
the matter, and almost without noise. â  It
was not known till every thing was over.
It is true that the anti-diredlorial journalists
had repeatedly denounced to the public a
plot, refemhling in some few particulars
the plan executed by the diredlory, but as
they had been ofte'ri obliged to retradl their
assertions, and to invent reasons in-order to
explain why the execution had been defer
red, they at last fell into the predicament
of they lying (hepherd in the fableâNobody
believed them when they told the truth. So
minute were the preparatives taken by the
diredlory, that the prisoners of the temple
had been removed the day before, and that
house of detention cleared for the reception
of the members who were to be arretted.
Gen. Moulin, and not Lemoine, was
the officer who, on the night of the 17th,
or rather on the morning of the iÃtb, ob
tained admittance into the garden of the
Thuilleries, through the gate of the Pont
Tournant, and arretted the members then
aflfembled. >â 
The fame day ( 18th) about 12 o'clock,
Lafond Ladebat, president of the ancients,
aud Simeon, president of the council of
500, followed by some members, appeared
at the doors of their refpedlive councils,
and demanded admittance, which being re
fufed them, they adjourned to a house in
the Rue St. Honore, and drew up a protes
tation ; but the fear of being arretted soon
forced them to disperse.
That day the theatres shut up, but open
ed the next. This evening, pursuant to an
invitation given from the diredlorv, the
adlors of the opera eelebrated the victory
obtained by the Republic over the attach of
Royalty, by giving the OJfrande a la Liberie
and the Marftillafc.
The law annulling the eledlion of several
departments, and â¢rdering the emigrants
to quit Paris, &c. having passed through
the necessary -formalities, has been promul
gated to da'y, and polled upon the walls ;
so that it is txpedled very few emigrants will
be found in Paris to-morrow evening.
Carnot has not been taken as yet, some
fay he has been killed ; others, that he ha 6
killed himfelf.
It was reported this morning at the coun
cil of ancients, that Dumourier and Bouille
are at Paris, that the latter has been arrett
ed, and that every precaution is taken to
discover the former.
No. 8 of the democratic conftitutionel
has appeared to day. He violently inveighs
against Merlin de Thionville for having pro
posed that Antonette and Felix Lepelletier
should be included in the decree of transpor
tation, and accufis that member of attack
ing the true patriots under tlie liatae of ariar- <
chifts. I ills makes forae peopte imagine '
that the Mountain is beginning anew to' '
rSife its head: But it appears that the di- '
redlory and a majority of both councils are j
resolved to keep it down. Tims will tell. c
In the mean while it seems, that the vidtori- i
ous party is resolved not to spill one drop of t
blood, and to use as lenient meafurts as the '
r.ature of circumstances will permit. 1
What will serve to confirm our formerÂ»ob- !
fervations on the trade of this city, is that
the public inferiptions which on the eve of i
the explosion were so low as seven, rose the t
two days following to 13, a rife ascribed to
the firmnefs and vigor displayed by the go
vernment This day at two o'clock they 4
fell to 10, owing to some appehtnfions of a
new commotion. .
Amongst the different persons spoken of j
as being to fill the two vacant places in the "
direflorv, the molt remarkable, are, Merlin, >
minister of jltftice; general Jourdan, Robert 0
Lindet, Garat and Talleyrand Perigord. I â¢
21 Fruftidor, Sept. 7. j)
Among the different objedls seized in the ;
place where the members of the commission a
were arretted by general Moulin, were a con- c
fiderable number of swords and daggers with '
hilts half red and half black, several packets
of cards signed Rorere, a new dress for the
deputies, and a chest containing 40,000 li
vres. | j
! The prisoners of the temple dine toge- t
ther, and communicate freely with one ano-; !
ther ; but are allowed no communication
| with the outlide.
They -ppear very airy, especially general
Pichegru ; Bourdon de L'Oife is the only j
one amongst them that appears dejedled. I a
Those not included in the transportation lift â¢ 1
, have been set at liberty. It is ever, allured i '
i that Thibadeau was at the fitting of yefter- 1
I day- t
By a decree of yesterday evening, the
journalists whose arrest had been ordered by '
the diredlory, have been condemned to be |
transported, and the diredlory authorized to :
make domiciliary visits in order to discover '
the retreats of such as have not been arretted. '
From the Ami des Lois, citizen Betami, '
living in Rue St. Logare, No. 1 79, has writ- \
ten the following letter, dated the 18th : c
" Yesterday, about 3 o'clock, a man c
whom Ido not know, came to me on the r
part, as he said, of the brother and secretary L
of general Pichegru, and offered me a muf- 1
ket,-piftols, a sword, and a good reward,
provided I would afiift at carrying off Pich- j
egru from the temple. I told him that I t
would consider about it. They told me t
they were very numerous and sure of fuc- {
cess. He teazed me very much, but to get j
rid of him, I answered yes. He wrote
down my name, and said he would call again.
They know me, at I served under Pichegru,
and went to fee him from time to time. But
I will never betray the republic."
I'rom the Journal des Hommes Libresâ
We read in the declaration of Duverne de
Prefle the following remarkable passage :
" There is a foreign party *vho expedl
the future afiiftance of Spain. At the head
ot this party are M. M. dela Vauguyon and
d'Entraiguts. I will give their means of
eorrefpondence with the Interior. The
members of this party think the king of
Spain is for them, and among other particu
lar*, the marquis de las Cafas.
" Now we mud observe, that of the in
dividuals mentioned in the above phrase, La
Vauguyon has been at Paris this long time.
His intrigues were known by the diplomatic
body, and he himfelf is not fignified /.mong
the conspirators lately fallen. Another, viz.
Las Cafas, remained in England notwith
standing the rupture with Spain, under pre
tence of an illness that has laflcd till novu, and n
arrived yesterday in Paris in high ftilcj at the a
Hotel d'Orleans, rue des Petits Auguf- f
tins."* v
Barruel Bauvert, author of the Adtes des â
Apostles, and Richer Serezy, aufher of the n
Accufateur Public, have been arretted. The a
ex-deputy Chiappe, attempting to get into f
the temple in order to speak to general Pich- ''
egru, was sent by general Dutertre, com
mandant of the temple, to general Ange- '
rau's head-quarters, and then arretted and [â 
sent to prison.
The report of the arrest of Bouille and r '
Dumourier is not confirmed. ''
The day before yesterday the constitution- f
al circle held a meeting at the hotel de Mont- J
morency. p ,
Yesterday the barriers were opened, and >'â 
the troops withdrawn from the bridges.
Places of public resort, such as the Palais 01
Royal, the Champs Elifees, the Garden of -J
the Thuilleries, &c. are as crouded as ever j hi
coaches and cabriolets roll about the streets e <
as usual. In fliort, every thing wears the
afpedl of the greatest tranquility.

been raised on a land convulsed and ready to

that the oath should be taken on the spot.
This motion being agreed to, the members

Sitting of Sept. 6.
The fitting being resumed at one o'clock
in the afternoon, Marbot was eleded Pre

Lacombe Saint Michel made a report on
the resolution of the 23d ult; relative to
the pay of difmifled officers, and tending to
force them to quit Paris, and to expe& the
payment of the above arrears in their ref

" Yes," said Lacombe, " gallant soldiers
of every description, you shall kno\v r that
a fa&ion as powerful as hypocritical, intend
ed to remove you from the place where the
government resides, which you have found
ed and maintained âyou shall know that it
aflemblcd the'fe emigrants, fanatical priests,
in short, the whole horde of royalist conspi
rators, to overthrow the republic. It was
teferved to one of the generals of' the army
of Italy to defeat this conspiracy without
one drop of blood beiftg flicd.
With what artonu'.'unent will Europe
learn, that the celebrated general who once
led our phalanxes to viftory, fold the Re
public to a Bourbgn. Let Pichegru and
his accomplices no longer defile the territory
of libertyâlet them carry their remorse to
the scorching foil of Africa.

be the dawn of the fined days of the Repub

Lacombe moved, that the resolution be
rejefted.
The council reje&ed the resolution, and
ordered the report to be printed.
Sitting of the 10th.
The council received, and immediately
approved of a resolution pafled yesterday,
which stated that all the armies having by
their conduft and addrefles, contributed to
the tranfaftions of the 4th of September,"
had deserved well of their country.
PARIS, September n.
The depmties condemned to transporta
tion, left Paris yesterday morning at 4 o'
clock, in covered waggons under a very
ftroug guard. Some fay they are to be sent
to Cayenne, others to Madjigafcar.
Several emigrants of diftindion have been
arrested Ihe number of paflports which
the Central Bureau continues to grant ex
ceeds credibility.
According to the reports which were in
cireulation three days ago, the half of
France was in flames. Lyons, it was said,
had revolted, the department of l'lfere was
in a slate of infurreftion, and the war in La
Vendee was kindled up again. The news
received from the neighbouring departments
is, however, dircftly the reverie : the Exe
cutive Dire&ory has received addrefles of
congratulation from fevcral. The intelli
gence of what happened on the 4th inft.
caused the liveliest joy at Rouen, and everv
wife measure was taken to secure the emi
grants, the priests, and she agents of Louis
XVIII. at Lyons, which has constantly
been the hot bed of superstition and of roy
alty.
It is probable that the 4th of September
will be considered in all the departments as
an epoch which consolidates the true inter
ests of the Republic, and rescues the consti
tution from the chains with which it was
opprefledâ (Le Survcillantt.)
LONDON, September ij.
The new Directors, as we have already
stated, are, Merlin of Douay, and Francois
de Neufchatean, the former of whom, after
having been privy to most of the maflacres
which have stained the revolution, in the
true hypocritical cant of a Cromwell, as
sumes the chara&er of humility in his ad
dress to the Dire&ory on accepting his new
office and faysâ" I cannot approach the
duties of it without a religious trembling.
What ought to be my anxiety and fear in
being placed so near to you, Citizen Di
reftors, around whom the beams of glory
shine with such tranfeendent splendor.
In the Redafteur of the nth is a letter,
signed Moreau, addressed to Barthelemi,
which the Dire&ory has sent to the two
Councils to render it the more public. This
letter is dated StaHburgh, Sept. 5, and
incloses some pretended correspondence
found in the tnunks of the Austrian General
Klinglin, many months since, in which
General Pichegru's najne is mentioned as
being in the league with the Prince de Con
de and other emigrants. As this secret has
been long in Moreau's pofleflion,we can on
ly account for his having published it at the
period he did in order to save himfelf at the
expense of his friend Pichegru.who he might
have heard was arrested. We must leave it
to future historians to account for a man of
Moreu's acknowledged bravery, meanly at
tempting to save his own existence by facri
fieinghis bosom friend. We have infrrted
the letter at length, as it is extremely fit to
be bound up with the pretended correspon
dence of the Cher. d'Entraigues.
In the Annales Politiques of the 11 th, it
is mentioned that news is arrived from Gen
eral Berthier, of the treaty of peace with
the Emperor being signed; but as this re
port is not confirmed in the succeeding. num
ber, we considered it to be premature.
Among the firft petitions presented to
the new Council (not of five hundred, be
cause one half the members are either trans
ported or fled) is an address from the deser
ters of the armv and other vagabonds con
fined in the prison St. Pelagie, praying to
be released, that they may fight the enemies
of their country. Their petition was order
ed for the inquiry of the military commifli
on. The next petition will probably be
from the Galley-Slaves of Brest.
Yesterday morning lieutenant General Sir
R.alph Ambercrombe arrived in town from
the Weft Indies. We understand that he
is to be appointed commander in Chief in
Ireland.
Merlin of Douay, the fun of a peasant,
was taken into a house of a religious com
munity as a servant boy. On discovering a
quiqknefs of talents, and a desire for learn
ing, he was taught to read and write, and
afterwards officiated as an attendant at the
celebration of mass. He was thence sent to
college, and became an advocate of the Par
liament of Douay, He purchased, previ
ous to the revolution, the title of Secretaire
du Roi, for the purpose of obtaining rank,
and afterwards attached himfelf to the fad
ions of Orleans. In all the ftnges of the 1
revolution, he has (hewn himfelf a molt 1
blood thirsty villain, and is supposed to have
been a principal plotter in the late revoluti
on. His charader i 3 extremely well suited
to that of his colleagues.
Six (hips of the line, including the flag

PORSTMOUTH, Sept. 13.

NEW-YORK, November 6.
From the Commercial Advert ifer.
The storm which has been so lon<r
t>
hanging over France, has at length burst.
âThe call of the troops to Paris and the
violent addresses of the armies were only
the precurfers of the explosion. Three
members of the dircdtory, Lareveilliere
Lepaux, Rewbel and Barras have been
taking measures to ftifle what they call a
conspiracy of the royalists, and having
secured a large military force and barred
the gates of Paris, they ordered their
two colleagues, Barthelemy and Carnot
to be arreftedâCarnot was not foundâ
Barthelemy is arrested, with Pichegru,
Willot, Dumolard, and other members
of the Councils. The papers, which are
called proofs of their guilt, have been
published, and without trial, a number
of the members as the Councils and the
two Directors, are condemned to banifb
ment.âThe prisoners Were immediately
sens off to Rochfort to be embarked, ei
ther for the East or Weft Indies. The
detail of these events is too important to
be curtailed.
At present, we shall make but one re
mark to fatisfy inquiries how far this re
volution. may affedt the United States :
and this is, that those members of the
directory and legislature who haye open
ly reprobated the condudt of the French
government towards this country, are a
mong the fallen and proscribed party ;
and our bitterest enemy, Merlin, rrtinif
ter of Justice, is elected one of the Di
reftory. Appearances are therefore ex
tremely unfavorable ; but perhaps the
cloud may be diflipated. We must wait
for further intelligence, before we can
form a decided opinion on the fate of the
proposed negotiation.
Among the exiled deputies we notice
Barbe Marbois, of the Council of El
defS) formerlyconful iiatheUnitedStates.
The Britilh frigate Doris, of 3$ guns,
Lord Ranelaugh, has taken, after a smart
aftion, off Ireland, the French privateer
Le Fabin, of 20 guns and 140 men.
From the Daily Advert'tfer.
The Emperor, or his Britannic Majes
ty, do not appear to be implicated in any
league with tlie late overthrown party ;
and yet the rtbrubt departure of Lord
Malmelbury from Lisle, would lead us to
suppose, certainly, that the events in Pa
ris were unfavorably viewed. In ac
counts of a prior date to this circum
stance, we notice that it was believed in
Paris, that Ch. de la Croix was agaiu to
be brought into action ; and from the
complexion of his former irrtercourfe
with Lord M. in his capacity as secretary
for foreign affairs, the English Editors
had began to apprehend consequences
equally unfavorable.
Lord St. Vincent was still off Cadiz,
and admiral Duncan off the Texel. Six
ships of the line are ordered to reinforce
the former, under the command of ad
mirl Sir John Orde, vice admiral Nelson,
who has retired upon a pension.
The President of the Dutch Conven
tion lias officially announced the rejec
tion, by the people, of the new consti
tution.
Carnot. There are no pofitire ac
counts of his death. In appears moll

Triei.hard and Bonnjer were the
new commiffioriers at Lisleâmen who
are fb.ted to have been of less accommo
dating views and manners than the for
mer ; another confirmation of the un
fortunate refhlt.
Pjchegru is UA to have told the
prince of Conde, he would leave no
thing unf.nifhedâ" I do not wish to
be the the third vol. of La Fayette and
Dumourier."
Tali.eyrand Pf.rigord. We find
him Ml among the candidates of the
fuccefsful party. He was on one nom
ination for the new vacancy in the Di
rectory, and his predecessor was again
employed. Weprefume it was in foir.e
diplomatic agency which has tended to
the unfuccefsful iiTue at Lisle.
Marbois, Gen. Jourdan, Gen. Hochc,
and others, are among the new party.
Died, lately in England, in child
bed, Mrs. Godwin j more known as
Miss Woiftonecraft, the celebrated au
thoress of The rights of Women.
A gentleman, who cam; paflenger in

The charge against Pichegru is, that he,
bribed by the Prince of Conde, was to place
Louis XVIII. on the throne, and who, in
return, was to be made marlhal of France,
and governor of AlsaceâTo have the Sig
