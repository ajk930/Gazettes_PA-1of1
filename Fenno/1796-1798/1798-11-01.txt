Mr. J. IV. FENNG. "
EASTIRN SHORE, MARYLAND.
M A GJN A NIMITT! en
A striking instance of this quality was exhi- j n
ted by Lieutenant Knight, of the artillery, in thi
late reneonire between this young officer and tin
Ir. James P. Heath. he
As, in.cases of this kind, both parties have th;
ieir friends, and, witji a portion of the world, W (
e"equally obi>oxious tocenfure, whatever may ur)
: the cause of quarrel; th; immediate occasion an
' this is purpolclj omitted.
They took their stand, by agreement, at so ari
trc!s apart, and were to advance and fire as 0 n
ev thdtijjht proper; each had a brace of pis-
Isâiftl efe .vere exhausted without effect they tei
ere to resume their and with re-load- tci
1 p.ftols to advince &c. as before, until they co
'ok ejfetl.
Two propofds were made on the ground, by
Ir. Knight's friend :
ift. That ihe difeharge of a brace of pistols,
l e3eh of the parties with or without effetf,
ou!d terminate the affair. This was rÂ«jedfed
adly. That, if either ftiould be wounded, ar.d
n tfce opinions of the surgeons, dangerously,
e thing ihould eeale. This was also dilTented
on.
Mr. Knight's friend knfiwing tbat he had 2>
evioufly deiermincd to give quarier, in c;>fe M
â¢ had Mr. Heath ia his power, thought it his ' I I
jty to inform him that no quarter would be al- thi
wed bini âthis was at the moment before they lil '
igan to advance. XÂ®
Mr. Kuight's second (h,ot firuck Mr. Heath't ln
ip, and brought him to the ground. Mr. K.'Â» j"
iend reminded him of the advantage, and, at fa ,
i-fame time, of the didlates of humanity. Mr.
knight immctiiately replied te his friend, and.
blerved to Mr. Heath, " that he did not v. ifh jk
> take his lite," and expressed a hope " that of
le wound might not ptove fatal." We are rt
appy to add, that the ball has been extracted,
nd Mr. Heath in a fair way to recover.
N. B. Mr. Heath was the challenger.
As the above account of thÂ« affair, taken from n ,
; The Gazette of the United States," contains a i>
harge of a very sanguinary complexion, agaiatt,
dr. Heath, and for which the following state- w
uent (not imagining it possible thatfuch an ac- w
ufation could ever be exhibited ) has nflt pro j'
ided refutation to deprive it of the intiu- jj
nee which it is evidently intended to have. I (
iO m positively aver, that it is utterly without
ruth, that no intimation of the kind was ever "
;iven hy me, either to Mr. Knight or his friend.
It was not blood but honour that afiuated Mr. ki
ieath, and so far from its being his intention v<
o deprive Mr. Knight of life, (had fortune P 1
ilacod it in his option) the verycontr ry was "â 
lis fixed determination; he had fully lefolved '
let to take advantage of hit fortune, at the ex- j 3
tence of his humanity. Had he fired his pistols j,
t the diftinte of fourteen 'or eighteen yjrds, he
ould not have charged bis humanity wi'h ihe Ui
onfequence, had it by chance proved fatal to Â«
lis antagonist. I hope thejudgmenl oi men is f>
lot yet so depraved, but that candour and truth cl
till, without any difliculty, be able to tftabliOi
hemfelve3 in the impartial mind, againlt any
iare assertion of their opponents.
Under this convidlioh that this hope
out.ded, I freely submit to unpr*judiced judg- a!
nent, the fallowing documents, and with them n
he entire juftification of my rrier.d. u

In Mr. Feno's Gazette of the united Sates of the

degree of intcreft ill the City. It ,s con_ Wc 1
firmed that. Bilonaparte did not reach Alex- o n j,part
andria till some days after Admiral Nelson fromSt
had left it. The landing of the French has ; n con j
been cbnfidered by the Porte as an open vio- a

ing its own canity. Russia joins with the It is f;
Porte oh the present occasion and the let- t he i\
ters from Vienna ffcte, that all the French The I
property in Turkey has l-een confifcated. ft an tin
The moll important intelligence is con. anJ[iet;
tained in a letter from Berlin, of the 4th 111-
ilant, which dates that accounts had reached Wc
Conflantinople of a place n
near Cairo, between a Turktfh force and the Q
Frenc'i troops under -reneral Buonaparte, in .
which tbk latter was d seated with confide-
rable lossâsome accounts f y, booo killed y
and 2000 made priloners. . lowini
This intelligence if true, is of the grcatelt (
importance to' Britain ; for there can be lit- g
tie if the French tnould succeed, t j iere
with the loss of even half of the army, in
reaching India by the rout they have taken, muc f,
that' otir pofleffio'is in that quarter wnulJ be um
much endangered.
The accounts that hav- reached us of this
cve.it, do not enable ui to state the particu
lars, or appreciate the degree of credit to ri -' n
which it may be entitled. It is plain, ho- ai ' '
wever, that if the pafTage of the Ifthmiis was
undertaken without theconfe*t ofthe 1 urks, I q uire
they had it io tAeir power to throw innum- l Â» vc
beiable obllacles in the way of their pro
