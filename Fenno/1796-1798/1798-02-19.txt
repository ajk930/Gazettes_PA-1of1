AT a junfture when the question of
a Commercial Treaty ivitb France may soon
become an object of difcufiion, a work of this kind
becomes extremely ufefat to those citizens of the
United Statei, who may be defirons to enable them- !
felves-to view this fubje<ft, under its various af
pe&s ; asd they will have the fatisfa&ion to be
furniflied with ntrceffary data, to judge of the
ufefulnefsof this tranfa&ion.
This work is principally diAinguifted by the
richness of the observations, the pcrfpieuity of the
iÂ«!eas, and the modesty of the theory which it
contains. At Pars, a man of wit observed, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufeful produce- It is addres
sed to the unfortunate La in letters,
which fugitive form, the author who could only
devote a few weeks to this occupation, was obliged
to adopt. Although cireumftanos are ia many
refpeds different at the present day, from what
they were in the year 1790, wten ,these letters
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so ma
ny absolute and permanent data (till remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the wQrk
lesson that account; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
fulc of the author's remarks, it will serve co con
vince him that in all tranfaetions, between free
nations, every thing maybe expedled from the ef
forts of truth and justice.
LETTER I.
General view of the obstacles,"created in France,
to pi event the extendon ot commerce, with tjie
United StatesâObservations made in a tour, taken
for that express purpose, uponfome French manu
fadures (a precious fragment this). Examination
and refutation of the prejudices eliding in France,
againlk the quality of certain produ<slions of the
United States, and against the advantages of their
importationâDemonltration of the bad policy of
laying duties ob their importation, principally on
proviGons in gener*!, and on fait provisions, and
fi(h in pa< ticularâConsiderations on the regulations
of the French custom-houses.

Observations on money, weights and measures.
LETTER 111.
Essay in the forr* nf a tableau, to appraise the im
poitattons into the United i>uteÂ»from France and tng- !
land un ted. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better (uvnifhed from France or
Englandâlt is principally on this fubjett (which
would have altonilht d a meie th? orill) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kina of tableaux, uuluckily as difficult to obtain as
they are much to be desired, are the only fuie guides
the llatciman can take tor th policy of treaties de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We Cinr>ot too much admire ihe apparent ex
a&nefs of colonel Swan's calculation*; and although
the prophcfies of Lord Sheffield hate already been
contradiÂ£led by experience, and by fcvcral able pens,
yet it is curious to fee the author of the present work,
dispute with him the only grout d on wh}ch he has
not been hitheito attacked, by proving that Fiance,
under the required condition, will be better able
than Gieat Britain to supply us with fcveral articles,
which the hucliih author aliots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's pat tia/ity m (if he
I has anv) does not appear to have at any time created
2 partiality of judgment. The re fa It of this calculation
! is that in *7B9* thai is to fay, at* period when arts
and manufactures did *Ol present in France the vail
means probabiU.y of cxtenfion winch they now
pofTcfs. that even in 1789, it was presumable, that
France would not only have the means to supply one
half of any given auanti'y of the prcdu&ions of France
and I ngland united, but also rÂ» enter into competition
with Great Britain for xhe remainder, in proportion
to the wildom of her government, and the iaduttry
of her inhabitants
LETTER IV.
Calculation of the exportations of the United States*
and particular examination of their fui'ableuefs to
France; this is one reason why, notwithftand ng the
excellent work of Mr. 'iench Coxe, Mr. Swan's ta
bleau is by no means fuperfluous . the priuciple of the
advantages which wou<d result to France Irom the
importation < f provisions and taw materials, is every
w here applied ; and it'is upon this argumeot, that
the author cftablilhes his demands to the French go
vernment, for the limited admii&on of the produc

LETTER > VI
General examination of the defefts of the commer
cial policy of France with refpett to the United State* ;
many of these observations have produced the effc&s
for which they jw/" intended, others still remain,
pointing out the Qns to be made in future, as a
good chart marks the shoals and rocks. The author
conclades his work* by fixing his attention on his
country, and the great men who have lerdercd it il
luftrious; and we take a pleasure in quoting what he
fays of the present chief of our government, 'l o
praise a man when he exercises a diliinguilhed em

>VHBN the world wat wrapt in ftiHneft, f
and tha pioat and the good were beading in ,
devotion, tke dogs, at though drawn by i
on* aniverfal sympathy, assembled on a t
mountain near Simftury Minet. A fileaee )
reigned thrmigbout the whole allembly, i
whea Jowler at leogtk proposed to choose
Lion President of the meeting 5 Scnp wat <
Appointed secretaryâ-The Prefidtat thca ,
opeaed by the following Speech : 1
â¢Â« Brethren of lit Canine Rate, (
"We are drawn to thit aflembly at by (
the cordt of calamity, and universal diftreft. ,
"the legillature of a people, whofc doort ]

to adopt meafuret for our fafety. There- ]

your miudt freely." . â¢ 1
The fubjeA thut opened, appeared infi- ,
nitely important. Every one of the aflem- |
bly from Jottler down to Whapet, made a
speech.
Whea th* othert had done, Sneerwell,
an old euaning cur, drew the afTctnbly s
attentioa by a long and intending fpcechi
fication, in which he observed, that " the
aft of the legislature was not left cruel than
impolitic ; not less unconstitutional than
unjnft. It is true that some dogs have been
attacked with a hydrophobia,which may
be communicated by a bite, by indenting
the fkinof the alTailed, and mixing the sali
va with its circulations. But it follows not i
from thence, that if the diseased animal be
the fubjeA of laws, that all the race
of Dogs (hall be exterminated.
" The human race are no less fubjeft to
madness than ours, and yet they wauld con
sider it highly unjnft to cut off the inno
cent with the guilty. What is it but mad
ness, that hat lately deluged the European
fields with blood I What is it but madness
that preventl that proud and profligate crea
ture man, from enjoying the blessings of li
berty, Â»nd his right (derived merely by
the use of hands) to universal dominion o
rer other animal* ? What is it but madness,
.which now involve* the United States in
controversy, where there is no room for
contest ?
Â«' The di (temper among them is commu
nicated by biting, in the fame manner, as
among ut.âWhet. Mr. ?â¢**â¢* had made
â¢n imm*nfe fortune by Tennessee lands, he
became mad enough to covet more; but he
fealitct that hit wealth ha 3 no enjoyment
appurtenant to it. The disorder spread.
Mr. B # *** # * and others grew mad for
' four million! in the east. The legislature
of Georgia beeam mad, and fold twelve
tnilliont of acres to Gunn andothert. Their
ffladneft increased, until they bunrt their
own recordt, disgraced their own govern
ment, and subverted all ideas of govern
mental faith and honor. Some of their gran
tees run mad, and bit lamentably MefTrs.

pÂ«t#Â» stu l Company; theferun
violently mad, and bit'a great number of
people in MafTtchnfetts âall these are now
mad, and trying to bite all who come with
in their reach. Gunn bit Greenleaf; he
bit a great number of the mod cautious
men in New-England. These are all mad.
But the noise thereof, Like our sympathetic
notices by night, has been echoed around.
Evety body it on the watch, and no body
will now (land still to be bit.
Â« Doftor Letfom of London 4Â«a mad up
on an ideal deed of the Indians in the moon,
tÂ« J. Carver. Three or four people of longe
tudinal greatness, run mad on the occasion,
and bit several hundreds of others.
n The people of our state (Connefticut)
run mad about their Sufquehannah claim,
and a great number have bten bitten, and
are now under a diftrefling hydrophobia,
from their wounds.
Â«Â« The general court opened a sale of th*
Connefticut Reserve. They fold more a
cret than th* Reserve contained. But the
purchtfert run mad, and bit others by fell
ing a million'which were nevÂ«r created.
" The General assembly wanted a Court
House ; and being under a disease, which
rendered tke grant *f money odiout to thrm,
they Told the Core to build the house ;
when it wat finifhed, they were mad enough
to dedicate it ly solemn fervicet of religion,
the Chaplain well knew
how it wat built.
" Thit disorder is not confined to one or
twollatei only. The ancient dominion of Vir
ginia, has been mud enough to fell fevtn
millions of aerrs, within a circumference,
where nature with all her powrn could not
place one million. The purchalers are bit
ten and run mad.
" New-York it in a manner, claiming all
the world as the rrfidutry Legatee of the
king of EnglandâltÂ« said they had a frelh
bite from his majesty in hit late illtieft.
" I fliall now proceed to illuflrate my po
rtions by other laAs, but flay ! I hear !

Extract
It is not flrange, that those who have
confeffedly done us injuries, (honld add in
sults. One great cause for our havinjj fuffer
ed both, is the unfortunate opinion of the
Rulers of the French Rupublic, that our
1 government and people, are divided between
France and England. This Is as falfe as
it is dilhonorable to the American name,
but neverthelefr it is believed, and the be
; i lief of it has drawn upon us, the experience
of the French system of depredation. This
; will appear by a very ftiort French argu
" ment- " Half, the Americans including
1 " half their Congress, will juftify and ap
' " plaud what we do, and as to the other
* half, the tools of Britain, no matter if
" u they fuffer loss by thÂ« French privateers
1 " the friends of France in America will re
Â® " joice to fee them reduced to proverty !1"
Â«Â«- What ftamps4iriportanc* on this last ob
* fervatioff,"knd gives it every mark of authen
f ticity, is the published correspondence of
* Mr Monroe, our late minister to the Re
Â» public; He fays that he informed the French
1 Government, that if they found it for their
r intercft to set aftde the articles' of treaty
refpefting neutral veffelt, the Americans al
* though it would be very detrimental to
9 thcin, \yould .not only acquiesce but re
e joice ia their so doing. No wonder such a
e minister wat recalled by the President, but
e it proves the aflertitni, that our troubles have
1 chiefly arisen from the falfe opinion of our
'â¢ being rather Frenchmen than Americans.
r It it time that Europeans, so long misled by
e their own vanitr, and the mifreprefentatioat
e of our renegado countrymen, (liould b* per
r fuaded to think with more refpeft of oar

111 a
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
_ i
FRIDAY FEBRUARY 16.
(Concluded from Saturday's Galeae. J
Mr. Livingfton said he wished to pro- t
pole a tefoiution for the adoption of the t
Houfc, wÃich had in view the encourage- '
ment of a mannfafture which wai much '
increasing in the United Statis, and might '
become of configurable national import- |
It was to the following effeft : r I
" Resolved, That the committee of com- .
merce and manufafturta be inftrudled to en- I
quire whether any provision be expedient j
for encouraging the printing of white cot
ton troodii in the United|fcates, and report j
thiir opinion the house.âA- |
gfeed. i
Mr. Livingfton called up for confidtrati- i
on the resolution which he yeflerday laid on 1
the table upon the fybjeft of the clashing
jurifdiftion of dates, when it was determined
to be referred to a committee of feTen mem
bers.
Mr. S. Smith said, that a letter and re
port of the Secretary of the Treasury on
the fubjeft of regulating the colleftiou of
the duties arising from impost and tonnage,
had been lefcrred to the committee of com.
merce and manufactures ; but as it was ne
ceflary obtain local information from parts
of the Lffiion from whence none of the mem
bers of the committee came, they wished,
for this particularpurpofe to havefomc mem
bers added, so that they might have the be
nefit of a member from every (late in the
Union.
After a few obfer rations, it was agreed
that the committee of commerce and manu
factures (liquid be discharged from the far
ther consideration of this fubjeft, and that
it should be referred to a committee of six
teen members.
Mr. Otis btlieved something further was
neceflary to be done in refpeft to the unfor
tunate business which had already engaged
the attention of the house. From what had
happened in the view of the house, it ap
pears that th s parties are in the habit of
confliftiÂ»g with each other, and except they
are restrained by some authority which (hall
be fufSciefttly impoling upon- them, farther
violence may be expefted. In order, there
fore, to secure this house from future viola
tions of its dignity and order, he proposed ,
the following resolution for adoption :
" Refolvedthat Roger Grifwoldand Mat
thew Lyon, members of this house, be ref
peftively required by the Speaker to pledge
their words to this house, that they will not
commit any aft of violence upon each other
during this feflion ; and that-if either refufe
to make such engagement, the party refu
ting (hall be committed to the custody of
the ferjeant at arms, nntil he fliall comply
with this obligation."
Mr. Sewall understood a motion had been
agreed to in relation to the affair of yester
day, which might produce an expulsion of
the mertiber3 in question* He thought it
woufd be better, therefore, to alter the
wording of the resolution, and instead of
" during this feflion," fay during the continu
ance â Â»/ the examination *f the bv/inefs lefore
i the house.
Mr; Sitgreaves did not think any altera
i tions was neceflary. An expulfioji of the
members was a pofiible, but not a neceflary
'â  result. If an expulsion does not take place,
f the tefoiution will remain in operation for
â¢ the remainder of the feflion, which would
r be proper, and if an expulsion took place,
â¢ its operation would fall ef conrfe.
Mr. J. Williams thought it best to pafi
r the resolution as it stood. If a similar reso
lution had been entered into on a former
' occasion, it would probably have prevented
what had now taken place.
- Mr. R Williams called for the reading of
f the resolution which was pafled on a former
occasion [lt was read; it dated, " That
* any personal contest between the members
) before the house had come to a decision up
* on the business, would be considered as a
* high breach of privileges."] Mr. W. tho't
this resolution went as far as the house had
a right to go. The resolution proposed by
the gentleman from Maffachufctts, went
, farther, he thought, than they had power
, to go. It went to imprison one or both of
â  the parties if he or they refufed to comply
1 with at request of the house. He had his
I doubts whether that house had the conftitu
; tional power to imprison a man for a crime
' as the law only could do this. He thought
a resolution similar to that adopted on a
I former occasion would be fufScient at pre
sent; and if the mover did not think proper
so to alter it, he would himfelf move an
amendment for this purpose.
Mr. Otis flattered himfelf, jhat his objeft
' wduld have met with the concurrence of all
fides of the house, believing that all wiftied
to prevent future violations of order and
peace, With refpeft to the doubts of the
i gentleman from N. Carolina, his politics.fee
' med to be altogether a system of double. If
' this system was common, it would be ex
tremely difficult to progress with business
at all. He believed, on the present occasion
' these doubts were groundless, When an aft
of violence was doRC in the view of members
f of the house, they had certainly the power
E to obtain some security against a repetition
of such violence. If this was not done, the
i preemption was, the business of the feflion
f might be continually interrupted ; and had
they noc the right of securing the peaceful
exercife of their legislative funftions for the
remainder of the feflio.i ? He thought this
I could oot feriouflv be doubted. With ref
peft to the former resolution, if he had been
- in his place, he (hould have suggested its
â¢ impropriety ; for, by it, it feeoned to be
implied that, after the question was deci
ded, though they could not no it before,
\ the members in question would be at liberty
' to commit any aft of violence they pleased
upon each â¢tbcr. They had fcen tbe con
sequence. He hoped, therefore, the houfc
would restrain these gentlemen in such a
manner as that it may not be is their power
again to interrupt their proceediags. ,
Mr. K. Williams defended hisopinv>nÂ» *nd
infilled upon hu right to deliver it, nor (hould
he ask any gentleman to explain to him the
oath he hid taken to support the constitution ot
the United States. When gcntlcwi n violated
the lulesof the house, the houfc had a rig.lt
to punilh them ; bet he wai doubtful whether
they had the poa'er to imprifona member if he 1
tefufed to fav.rÂ«, to a question whicn (hould be 1
put t>< him.
Mr. Sewall presumed that the house had the
fame right which every court poffefled of pre
fervir.g its order by imprifonnimt <)f offenders I
and it was incident to this authority to restrain
persons likely to-commit these offences. It was.
neceflary for the future security ot the hÂ«ufr,
for these gentlemen to fay, " they will nat a
gain afT.iult each other." This a m.-ans of
prev. nting and not of pnnifhing . ffciiceÂ». He
had no ohjetfios to the resolution, therefore, on
the ground of power, but lie had some doub" as
to the pr priety of the exprcflj'Sn. Fir, said
he, Jiippofe these gentlemen are expelled, ant!.
Mr. CÂ». afterwards aflaitW Mr. L. the former
might confi'ler himfelt boirml by his promise to
the forbear to defend himfel . To 4
rorrefl this impropriety of exprelfion, he mov
ed to strikeout the words " durinÂ« this feflion,"
and infer. " suhilfl members of this hpufr."
Mr. Otis confentril t" this amenJmcut.
Mr. Sitg;reaves wished the mover to alfent to
another phraf.-ology <?f his motion. Aifts inigh:
perhaps b; corp:nitted which wou'.d not be cal
led ttjt of violence, though vet y offcnfive lie
wifbed the fame word used as formerly, viz.
personal eo iteU -with ettch other.
Mr. Nichoiai had no oVjeflion to the general
ohjes of this i-efalution ; but the amendment
of the gentleman from Mafiachufetts went to
govern members during the recess of Congrrfs.
He supposed this was soing farther than gentle
men themf'elves intended He thought a rel'o
lnti'-n like the former, which fijould ex!Â»nd dur
ing the prefer.t feflion, would answer every pur
pose. He did not fee any nceeflity to infliiit pe
nalties before a breach of order was committed.
( Mr. Venahle said, the idea i f the gentleman
from Malfachufetts ( Mr. Sewall) was not e'er
refl, when he suppose 1 an obligatioÃ entered
into at this time, would be binding when a per
son ceased to be a member of that house. All
obligations wh'ch members owe to the house,
are difTolved when they cease to be members ;
nor wai it in the power of the house to extend
the force of the refolutioon beyond the prtfent
. fcfiion. He (hould not object to its having that
extent. He thought it only reasonable, in order
to obtain a pmfpeJl of future peace in their de
liberations, that these gentlemen (hould declare
that they will not enter into any further person
al conte# during the feflion. He moved, there
fore, again to *ltÂ«r the rtfolution to read dur
ing the fefjion.
i Mr Otis" hoped the amendment would be
made, he had too readily consented to the for
. mer alteration.
The question was then taken on the refolu
tion, and carried *y a large majority, there be
â¢nt> 7.1 votes in favour of it.
The Speaker aflied whether it was the plea
sure of the house that the sergeant at arms (hould
: be sent for Mr. Lyon.
Mr. Sitgreaves said it might nÂ»t be eonveni
r ent for Mr. Eyon to attend the house ; he a(k
---r ed whether the resolution might not be sent to
him, and his answer be received in writing !
Mr. Nicholas supposed, that if both gentle
man prepared a declaration in writing, and pre
" fented it to-n,orrow, it would answer the pur
â  pose.
t Mr. Harper replied the tnifchief intended be
; be guarded against might in the mean time be |
f do*e.
Mr. Gallatin said, he had jufl been called out
by a member of tfie houfc who had alked him
e whether he thought it would be proper for Mr.
Lyon to attend the hotife. He supposed, there
. for*, jf the ferjeant at arms was sent for him, he
e would immediataly attend.
Mr. Harper hoped the ferjeant at Arms would
' be sent.
> The Speaker said, as soon as tbe clerk had made
r a copy of the resolution, the ferjeant at arms
i wou'd wait upon Mr. Lyon with it.
, I Mr Elmendorf prcfentud a petition from ââ
' Van Rei felaer, and others, for sup plies ftirniftied
doii' g the war.
' Mr Dawfon prpfented two petitions; one from
i- John Whitlock, iare afoldier in the war, and HÂ«n
---r ry Heely. a continental waggoner, for compenfa
j tion for servicesâThese three petitions were re
| fcrrcd to the committee of claims
I Mr; Wadfworth prffented a petition from the
* , Portland Marine Society, praying for certain buoys
r to be placed in that harbor.
' Mr. N. Freaman prefcnted a memorial from the
5 merchants and fcip owners of New- Bedford, pray
i- mg for theercflion of two light hoafes, and some
jl buoys; and also that that port may be made a
port of entry ior the Cape of Good Hope and he
' yond.âThis and the lafl petition were referred to
3 tbe committee of commerce and manufa&ttres.
y The bill appropriating money for holding a
t treaty with the Indians in the (late of Tenaelfec,
r wai received from the senate with amendments,

rELLOW CITIZENS,
A person, who, in the Philadelphia Ga
zette of the 14th inilant, haÂ« thought pro
per tÂ« aflurae the title of A Friend to Jus
tice, has endeavoured to alarm your fears,
on the fubjeft of your right of fuffrage.
He Items to believe, and he end#lvourÂ»
to make you believe, that the report of the
committee of the Senate, against the valid
ity of Mr. Israel's ele&ion, was founded ex
clufi/ely upon the omifilon to require a cer
tificate of allegiance.
Defi.rous of ascertaining the truth of the
charge, I have applied to a member of that
committee, who very readily furnifhed me
with a copy of the report which was proposed
to be made, and which contains, a full state
ment of the principles, on which they form
ed their decision. Tamauthorifedtofay, that
the only,reafon why'it wasnot made at length,
was, that a majority of the committee,
thought it most confident with parliamenta
ry forms, to Report their fleci'fion without
assigning their reaforis, but'as their conititu
ents have an interest in knovfrihg the grounds
upon which the deciGon they*
have no obje&i'en to its being made public.
The pertifal of this paper .will surely re
fute the acrimonious chargeS'o'f the writer
I have alluded to. Your privileges have not
been violated, your rights have not been
outraged, your voice* bave not been set at
nought, unless it is an injury done to citi
zens to confine to themselves th'fe'exercife of
tlieir best and dearell privilegrs'te prevent
an unauthorized and illegal usurpation ef
theii rights and to prcferve by all imaginable
care that purity of election on which the
fafetyof a republic depends.
It is the vital principle of a republic to
repel from its e-ledioiis all foreign interfer
ence. Those only,* who being citizens,
have a manifeft and permanent interest in its
welfare, pofiefs the right of fuffrage, and
can be legally called to the exercise of it.
If upon examination a single vote appears
to have been rtceived from a ft ranger and an
alien ( and all -who are not citizens are aliens J
it is necessary to rejedl it, for such a vote
passed over to day, is a precedent for thou
sands on the next occasion.
The committee of the senate would there
fore, have betrayed the solemn trust confid
ed to them, would have defetved the censure
the indignation of their country, had they,
upon any considerations whatcyer, allowed
the votes of those, who are not citizens, ac
cording to our laws, to be numbered with
the votts of those who are.
In every such inftanee the value and effett
of your own fuffrages is impaired. It is f>
l*ntly leflening your interA in''the commit
nity ; it.is creating officers fgr the people,
who are not chosen by the peopleâ(for the
people of. a state means the citizens of a
state) it jÂ» ( compelling to submit
to. laws you have i\ot paflfd, and to o
bey magistrates whom you haiVe not chosen.
' Yet you are warmly urged'by some who
mean â Well, 'and by Others whoknnw better,
to coniider this just aid legal determination
of the do'rhmittee, as an injury done to you,
to the citizens, the conftitwt'iitoal eleflors of'
this diftrid.
In all countries where popular eleftioos
are te be found at all, they will be found to
be confined to the citizens, H>r>(in monarchi
al societies) the fubjeds of thiofe countrie*.
In Franee, and all the'countries which
Francs has fraternized, the vote of a per
son not an active citizen, as -there termed
would be treated with c'ontetnpt. In En
gland, Scotland and Ireland, the right of
eleding is much and variously limited ; but
in all most jealously guarded. Shall our free
and happy American commonwealths be
contaminated, our sober and rational consti
tutions, happily combining the enjoyments
of liberty with the obligations of law, be
undermined by flie spirit as a party, which
veiling its attachment to a paiticular cha
racter under the pretence of zeal for the
public good, endeavonrs to excite your re
sentment at the preservation of your own
rights, and ipflame you against the decision
of a legal tribanal, because it did not take
less care of the privileges of citizens tban
would have been taken in other countries ?
My fellow-citizens, whether by birth or
naturalization, rcjed these insidious artifices
âbe steady in theprefervation of your rights
âfufped the man who endeavors to dimia
ifh their value, eled the Senator who can
best perform the duties of his trust, and
preserve inviolate the iaterefts and indepen
dence of your country.
A Citizen of Pennsylvania.
Feb. 14, 1798.
The COMMITTEE feleSedagreeably to law,
to try the matter of the petition complaining of
the undue election of Israel Israel, returned as
a senator for the difiriS comprfcd of the City
and county of Philadelphia, and the county of
Delaware, and sworn or affirmed to give a
true judgment therton Recording to the evidence,
report, that agreeably to the duty thus solemn'
ly imposed on them, they proceeded to tali tie
said petition into conjideration, and required
Â»f the person appearing in behalf of the pe
titioners, to spec fy in writing Jhis objt&ione
against the f.iideleOion, who, thereupon f re
sin ted the following:
" 1 ft, The eledion in Southwark was not
; held at a place appointed agreeably to the
laws and constitution of this state.
2nd, The legal proof of citizenfliip was
not required of those who voted in Sovth
wark and the Northern Liberties,
i 3d, A fufficient number of votes to set
aside the eledion of Mr. Israel, were re
ceived from persons who were not qualified
to vote far members of the senate."
' That it appears, that by a law palled the
till day of March, 1797, entitled. "An
ad for the eredion of certain eledion dif
trids, and for other pvtrpofes therein men-tioned," the freemen ofthediftricl Â»;fS > i.h- (;t
mit. and of tlie townlhips of. f;
and Paffyuak were, from thenccfortfi to te
hold their general eleftions at the Com-nijjt- as
nur't-haH\n the diftriift of Southward afor*- or
laid. an pasTed the 2oth day tli
â¢f September, 1781, entitled, "Ana 3 to ce
enable the eommiGiouers therein named, to qi
purchase public landings iu the dittrift of ai
Soi/liwark, ia the county of Philadelphia, sic
and for raising a fund to j>ay the parchafe qi
money thereof:" ar.d a:i aÂ£l pafled the 18th pt
day of April, 1794, entitled, "An aÂ£l to to
iucarporate the diftiicl of Southwark," the th
commissioners were authorifrd to Jim on their je
place of mreting.âThat from the evidence vc
adduced to the committee it appears, that w
at the time the legiflaturr pasTed the law for qi
holding the general ele&ion at Cemmiffion- F
ers'-hall, the said commissioners held their te
meetings at a place known by the names of a
" Little's fchool-hoÂ«fe."âThat about two ei
weeks before the late general ele&ion, they tu
changed their place of meeting to the house Â»c
of Samuel GofF, in ibl said diftrift. That S
in Confequtnce thereof, the general eleftion bi
was held at the house of the said GofF. It h
appears, that at the time this removal took
place, the late contagious fever made it dan- vi
gri out to meet at Little's school house : jv
t/Hit full- and complete notice was given of tl
the plape of holding the ele&ion: nor does tl
it appear that any person was prevented b
from voting on that account. v<
Under this view of the ease, the commit- t;
te? are as opinion that if it was wrong for o
the commissioners of Southwark to pofTefs ti
the power to change the place of holding It
the ele&ion, the fault lay with the legifla- h
ture, who, it may fairly be implied, gran- p
ted that power, and not with the commif- f
lionet s who exereifed it; and as no difadvan- d
tnge appears to have resulted from the re- o
moval, the committee are of opinion the
eledlion ought not to be set aside on account t
of the firft objeftion. a
That with rcfpedl to the second objec- d
tion, tÂ» wit, " That tke legal proof of e
citircnfhip was not required from those who v
voted at Southwark and the Northern lib- e
erties." It appear by the evidence of the t
judges and infpe&ors, that no enquiry was c
made of sny person offering to vote at the I
said diflricts, other than whether they were }
31 years of age, had resided 2 years in the f
state, and within that time paid a Rate or I
county tax, assessed at least fix months be- 1
fore the ejr&ion ; or beihg between 21 and 1
12 jean of age, and not having paid taxes, f
that thpy were the sons of persons qualified f
as aforefaid. That the season why no evi- <
dence of citizenship was required by the )
said judge* and infpeftors, appears to have I
been from an opinion entertained by them I
that nil freemen who had resided two years
in the state, and paid a tax as aforefaid, 1
â were enticed to the rights of an eledtor. In
the opinion of the committee, in addition
to the payment of tax and residence, as a
forefaid, to entitle any person t<) the rights
of an ele&or, he must have been a natural
born cititen of the United States, or fet
tled therein on or before the 4th day of Ju
ly, X 776 ; or in this state on or before the
aSth day of September, in the fame year ;
or being a foreigner, who, since that time
~ came to fett'e in this state, he must have ta
. j keit an oath pr affirmation of allegiance to
the fame on 6r before the 36th day ofMarch,
-\t79o, agreeably to the then existing confti
lutioo and laws, or hive been lavffully ad-
as a citizen of some other of the U
sited States, on or before the day last men
tioned ; or haÂ»e been naturalized conform
ably to the laws of the United States. J
That although several parts of the present
eleftion laws have grown obsolete from there
beinj no ofcjedt to operate on ; and the
â¢oaths and the affirmations therein prescribed
to be taken by the judges and infpe&ors are
in some parts not only inapplicable to pre
sent eircumftances, but would impose an o
bligation contrary to subsequent laws, and
that therefore the necessity of the cafe jufti
. fied the judges and infpeiSors in the said dif
trids, as well as the city and other places,
in the alterations as to form with which
they took the said oaths and affirmations,
yet this could not impair the legal or moral
obligation incumbent on every person under
taking to perform an office, to fulfil and
difoharge all the duties which the office im
poses, and as the present eleftion laws clear
ly point out the mode in which foreigners,
who had acquired the rights of citizenship
under the former constitution and laws of
this state, are to give evidence thereof when
they offer to vote at elrflions ; the plain in
ference seems to be, that the fame mode
mull apply as ftr as eircumftances wilj ad
mit, to the giving evidence of such right,
although acquired under another authority,
or different laws. It cannot be pretended,
that a person who has not complied with
the stipulations necessary to become a mem
ber of the community, enn have any right
to vote for persons who are to regulate the
affairs of the commuaity. When, there
fore, he attempts to exercise a privilege at
tached to that right, he must give some evi
dence that he i* entitled thereto. The com
mittee are therefore decidedly of opinion,
that admitting persons indiscriminately to
vote at the general tledlions without mak
ing any enquiry as to their being citizens,
if the fame be not within the knowledge of
the infpeflor or some judge of the eleftion
or without requiring due proof thereof if
they have any dcubts refpefting the fame,
isdire&ly contrary to the letter and fpjrit
of our constitution and lawsâthe result is,
that the second objedlion has been fully sub
stantiated.
The committee thinkit their dÂ«ty to state
I that thtre does not appear any reason to
suppose, that the judges and infpedtors of
the said diftrifts were influenced by any im
proper motives, nor has any charge Â®f that
kind been made agair.fl them ; that it ap
pears the eledion in both diftriAs, except
as to the omiffiou aforefaid, was conduced
regularly, and in a fair and impartial man
lifrT.
In forming ajtdgrfent how far an onif-
(ion, irregularity, or aegleA, to as- j cu
fe3 the return of an election, the commit* I no
tee, presume the enquiry, will naturally be * frs
as tu the uTett such omission, irregularity to
or neglefl, would probably produie: If ce
the effefl could not be such as to deftrov t-he to
certainty of the poll, or the rights ~t>f the ce
qualified ele&ors, it would be unreasonable th
and unjust that an eleflion fhotild be set a- mi
fide. If on the contrary the right* of the re]
qualified eleftors, or tha certainty of the ho
poll might be destroyed, it becomes a duty - ex
to enquire how far that has been the cafe ; | j;
this leads to a confederation of the third ob- J
jeflioo, to wit, " a fulficient number of
votes to set aside the eleftion of Mr. Israel =
were rec-ived from perfous who were not
qualified to vote 1 for members of the senate."
From the evidence produced to the commit
tee, they are decidedly of opinion, that
a greater number of persons who were not
entitled to vote for members of the legifla- j ,
litre, have been admitted to vote for fena- ,
tor ae the eleflion held in the diftrift of "
Soufhwark, thjn the difference in number
between Mr. [frael and the person next
highest in vote.
Ele&ions by ballot are unquestionably fa-
vorable to the eleftors exercising his own
judgment independently, without fear, or .
the hope of favour ; but they are liable to
this inconvenience, that when tickets have .
been received from persons not entitled to
vote, it is generally impra&icable to afcer- .
tain for whom they were given.âDangers
of a feriows nature might arise from admit
ting a person who had been improperly al- a *
lowed to vote, to give evidence as to whom
he had voted for. If he had really votedfora
particular ticket, and, after detection, (Tiould
falfely declare he had given one of another .
description ; and if this declaration should
occasion a dedu&ion from the person or per
sons he had thus falfely declared he had vo- tc
I ted lor, it would increase the firft injury,
I and leave no possibility of applying a reme- v j
Idy : but if no danger was to be apprehesd- ,
led from this source, theperfon who had thus p
voted, probably not feeling inteiefted iu the
event of the eleflion, but brought forward
by the solicitation of some friend or ac-
I quaintance, might not know for whom he
I had voted. It appears, therefore, to be im-
I possible to ascertain with accuracy, the ef- c
I feft of improper or illegal votes, .except they Â®
j have been given in a diftrift where the votes j.
I have been all for any one candidate or near-
Ily so. If so many illegal votes hr.d been v
I given in any diftridt as would exceed the dif- ,
I ference between the person returned and the |
one next highest in vote, and all the votes
I given to the lad mentioned candidate in the
j fame'diftrift, it would then certainly be right
j to set aside the return of the fitting member
I and declare the other duly elefled ; but ex- <
I cept in a cafe thus circumstanced, it would w
Ibe wrong to do this,'let the number of il <
I legal votes which have been received, be e- 1
I verso great, as it could only.be introducing 1
I one uncertainty in the place .of another.â
I But they are a 'so of opinion, that the votes '
los qualified eleftors ought not to be fuffered '
Ito be destroyed by admitting" such a num- {
â  Iberof persons to vote who were pot.qualifi
led agreeably to the laws and constitution of j
â  I this (late and of the United States as might
. I change the state. of the poll. Whenever
i such a number has been illegally admitted,
, j whether it be an hundredrh pats or a mbjo-
I rity of all the voters, the committee fee no
- I remedy that can be applied but a new ele&i
. lon, in which proper 'attention may be paid
- I to the qualifications of the perfcvi9 offering
. I to vote : without this be attended to, our j
. I cleftions will not be considered as an expref- j
t I fio.n of the will of "the majority of the citi- j
e I zens, to which the minority arc bound to 5
e submit.
J After due consideration of the cafe now
e before them, they do from the evidence ad
! dticed, give it as their judgment and opini
i- [on that the return of Israel Israel as a Se
el nator, for the djftrift composed of the City
- and County of Philadelphia and County of
Delaware, ought to be set aside.
i, In the arguments of Council on the pre
h I lent occasion, many precedents and authori
i, I ,ieÂ« have been cited, and much ingenious
il I reasoning used, but very few of the cases or
â - 1 authorities are applicable to the mode of
d I holding elections by ballot, and of those
i- I which might be applicable to that mode,
â - I none haw arisen from decisions of commit
i, I tees instituted in that solemn manner which
p l our conflitution and laws at present pre
if I scribe; but little information on the fuhk.fl
n I could, therefore, be derived from those
i- I sources.
le I In determining on the obje&ions made to
[- I the tight of persons to vote at the eleftion,
t, I the committee have been governed by what
r, I they conceived was the law on the fubjeft:
1, I they did not believe they had anyautUority
h I or right to eiercife a mere difcrction, and
i- I in so doing, admit or rejeft without rule, as

MR TENtIO,
It iÂ« with pleasure that t inform you, rt
thai the violent proceedivgs of the'ftiends
of Mr. Israel has had the happy efFc& to -j
animate the friends of order, several persons n
are now very aftive, who had not even de- tl
clar-ed their fentimenti, before the infiilt of- b'
fered to Mr. Morgan's friends waÂ» made *
knownâOther*, though residing here for
some years, had not been naturalized, are
now coming forward in open court, to join j,
! the friends of the confUtution and govern- o
' nient. h
I do Bot mention these things with a view 1
to leflen the exertions of our friends in the '
cause of the commonwealth ; No. I pub- t
lilh them, that they may stir up others to
the exercise of their molt sacred rights, while r
in their power. For it is most certain, that j
the fame spirit, which has led them to in
trude onour private companies.will lead them ,
to exfirpate. every civil-right, which we, 1
citizens of the United Stated, and of Penn- 1
fylvania glory in, and which in duty we ate 1
bound to deliver pure to our posterity.
Let every citizen if he believes that- op- 1
position will gain the election of Mr. Israel,
let him, I fay, come forward with his vote
and influence, to lelfen the majority of the
Jacobins. And let ever/ person who ia con
fident in the eleftion of Mr. Morgan, come
forward and strengthen that confidence by
every contlitutional measure in his power.
Let us endeavour to incrcafe the majority,
as the sure and the only means left, to se
cure the poQcffion us our invaluable privi
leges.
Not boasting, but with regret, I add,
that my exertion extended wight turn
ed the late eleftion in Miv Morgan's fa'vdr,
and prevented the pirefent difagreeak3Â« cottr
