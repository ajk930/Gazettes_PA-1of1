HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES,
Wednefibry, Afiy 24.
( !flr. Swan wick's S/i.'Â«4 concluded.)
Ai to the fpoliatiwns, they rioubtleft ire alf:>
causes of jult tompkriut' from America ; l> .t
while they are equally continued to thisdsy, by
England, Spain, Holland and France,"we ought
to go to war with all these powers ; if we mean
lo attack any on tfcis scoreâtor lurety, the
groans of Our teamen, fa emphatically heard by
a gentleman up before me, from Maflachuletts,
are heard as dillinilly from Cape Nichola Mole,
as fivmi Cipe Francois, and ought to rouze e
qual indignation, uajei's we have ears to hear for
injuries from one quarter only. He thought,
; :udeed, it would evince our spirit to go to <war
jjitb them nl! and by that means retaliate up
on each the mjsries we have recciÂ»ed from each.
But nothing was laid aoout the spoliations of
die Britiftt. The UntiQi take property bound
to France in p'iri'uance of the treaty ; and the
French taking advantage of the stipulation made
in the liritdh treaty, that " free (hips do not
make free goods," take our property lkjund to
Englifii ports. So that this is the ground upon
which all our difficulties reft. Upon the ad
mission to take, lies the evil; for, a French pri
vateer meeting an American merchantman, fays
to him, " Yon have Englilh goods on board."
He answers " no," but the veflel is taken into
a French port, to undergo a tiial, and in the
mean time the engagements of the merchant
becomes due, which being unable to meet from
this failure in the arrival of his veflels, hs is ru
ined. l'he fadV is, that while the war lasts, so
will the fpoliationt in spite of every thing we
can do to the contrary ; not because the nations
at war are just, but because they are powerful
and use that power only as suits their own inte
rest without reference to our grievances or com
plaints. For this there is no remedy but an
embargoâfini e nothing fliort of this can pre
vent the captures coisplained of, and this
remedy has bee# thought worse than the disease,
since it puts a flop to all commerce, and must
tend to lower the prices of all our produce ;
we must therefore, he prefumcd, leave trade to
regulate itfclf in this refpefl. Although it may
be incidentally ohfeived, that our European
and China, and East India trade have been hith
erto preftrved pretty free from violation. We
hive iuffei ed inoft in the WcA Indies âbut here
it is to be remarked, the French republic have
no decided power, their islands arc governed by
a provisional agency, who are obliged to keep
the blacks and mulattoes in good humor in or
der to preserve those poflefiions, and who are
so little under the controul of France, that they
have frequently (hipped back to them the gene
rals and commifiioners, they have sent out to
them. In the Weft Indies, in faft, all is plun
der, the age of the fluccaniers is revived, and
even exceeded, and those who go thither mufl
trust for fafety only to their heels ; for as to
arming them, I doubt much whether we could
prevent this being made a pretext of for fitting
out more privateers and from among ourselves,
who perhaps, according to their different inter
ests, w6u!H, under pretext of defending com
merce, only be committing spoliations on each
other at seaâWar might increase the quantity
of depredations, but I doubt, if by this men
fare, we could lately repress or controul themâ
foor.er or later it must lead u? to the calamity
we all wife so ardently to avoid, the pcfitive e
vils-afid misfortunes Â®f war.
But it is stated Franca wanted to divide the
people from the government, and to it
unduly ; and this has been compared to divid
ing us from ourselves ; as if Ihe wanted to tear
the arms from the (houlders, the legs from the
thighs, or the head trom the trunk ; this is sure
ly too absurd for any government to have inten
ded, and could never be expected to l'ucceed,
unless indeed measures were to be taken by the
government, oppressive and injurious to the peo
ple j in which cafe we have often seen this ef
fect produced in other countries, not so much
however from foreign faflion or influence, as
iromdomeftic oppression or difcontect. A ge
neral clamor was indeed raised against France,
in Europe, as if she were the enemy of all fociai
order and government j but the fa<ft is, their go
vernments would never have been affefled, but
in proportion as they were intrinCcallj bad and
oppressive. In this country, the people love
the governmemt becaufe'they arc happyâkeep
them so, keep them as free as possible from tax
es, embark them in no unnecessary wars or
troubles, and you need never fejr the effects of
any foreign influence on them. Alarms of this
kind may do well for huHgry pamphleteers and
greedy scribblers, whole writings, it is to be la
mented, art so greedily purchifed and read >-
mong us ; but never ought to be admitted with
in the limits of these walls; all thenoileof Bri
tilli and French parties in this country being
merely terms of abuse bandied about,and at belt
but empty nonsense.
But it isfaid, our independence is menaced
and we must make a Cecsnd edition ef it. By
whom is it invaded ? Does France want to gov
ern us ? She would have but poor encourage
ment in this, from the fate of her predecessor.
Can Englahd desire it ? She makes more by us
in the silent, but preclusive operations of trade.
Let us not then deceive ourselves by this empty
declamation. If France finds fault, it is not
at our laws or coaftitutions, as they relate to us
at home ; surely if by any cffccls of them a
bioid, they operate to her disadvantage, lhe has
a right to complain, and we ought to euquire
into the complaint, and if well founded, to re
dress it as far u is in omt power.
But a gentleman from Massachusetts appre
hends the Atlantic will not be able to restrain
the tide of French vi&ciies they will land'and
revolutionize the southern states, and free the
negroes j I eonfefs, said Mr. S. I have no appre
hensions of this kindâbut if we really have
such ideas, so much the more careful ought we
to be, to avoid a war, which has been so def
lating tÂ» other nations, and efpeeially now
when they are getting fa tired of it, ahd anx
ious to put an end to it, fer it is plain, their ex
hausted resources must soon compel to do this,
and it would be an unlucky moment for us to
get into the scrape, as others were getting out
of it.
It h:.i been often observed, that the people
and the governmenfare one ; but if the reprc
fenutivei were compelled to divide, even tocar
ry an answer, by a majority ofoneort wo votes,
will this carry an ide* of unanimity ? Had we
not better modify the answer is such a way Â»
may produce a more genera! acquiescence in it ?
This will give more true dignity to our proceed
ings, and give a proof that we are govcrncd-by
rcafjn more than by passion, by the love of our
country. rather than by any other eonfideratlon.
Mr. Livingfton having liftencd to the fe
vtrral gentlemen who had preceded him, with
the molt refpeftful attention, and heard
their ardent exprefiions of patriotism, and
the lively sense which they eutertained of the
true dignity of our government, he (hould
not attempt to follow them into a field which
they had exhaufled, but would leave it to
the confider?.t:on of the committee and his
country to determine upon his sentiments
cadtf
and the measures which he should fuggcfl,
-âwhether he was or not, equjllp difponid
with others 40 promote the peace and honor,
the happiness and the security ofÂ»hi3 coun
try and government ; he would leave it for
his measures to speak for him, he would not
fce led away by arty idle Or extranious vanity
from objefts so solemn and important, he
should speak. freely as became an American
at a crilis so very prelliiig. First, then, lie
(hould notice the address that was before
the committee and the amendment proposed
to be made to it. He w Â» fori y-to observe
the manner in which they had been dilcufTed;
it had been conjidered on one fide that to a
dopt any language in reply to the address
but that which has been laid before the com
mittee in the report, would amouna to a
surrender of all our rights, privileges and
independence as a nation, to France ; on the
other it had been held that the differences
between us and France are distorted, and
that we should at least not (hut up evsry av
enue to negociation, by an obflinate and
blind affcrtion of our own infallibility : if
he believed with those of the former opini
on that we should in any shape incur the
fligma of degrading ourselves, or if he fuf
peclcd even that we should facrifice one
right of our country or government by an
adoption of the amendment proposed, or
he thought we should not endanger our na
tional charafter and fafety by the adoption
of the report, he should most certainly re
jeft the amendment and adopt the report ;
or if he believed with the gentleman from
Maffachpfetts (Mr. Otis) that the demands
of France now were any-wise analogous to
those of Great-Britain on a former occasion,
sooner than consent to a dereliction of our
independence and national character, he
would not flop short of the language of that
report ; but as he could not force his judg
ment to so outrageous a mifconftruftion, as
he saw on the contrary numerous reasons to
entertain a very different opinion, he would
not consent to incur the perils and the errors
in which the report may involve us ; he
could not consent to so hasty, so precipitate
and inconsiderate a step:
The question properly before the house at
this time, is, whether we shall continue to
express so perfeft a reliance on all the afts of
our own government, whether we shall fay
obstinately to France that there is no possi
ble cafe in which our judgment could have
been milled or miflaken in our conduft to
wards her, and by determining to adhere to
our former conduft, preclude every possibi
lity of an amicable adjuflment ; or leave a
reasonable opportunity open for an effectual
discussion and adjustment of differences,
wherever they may fubfifl.
The scope of the speech of the President
to both houses, it must be confeffed, goes
to bind us to the former conduft, and it is
too evident that the report, in ftrift coincid
ence with the sentiments of several, but not
all its fupforters, bears that fame dangerous
tendency ; from which line of conduft are
we to expeft the most beneficent ifTue, to
treat with a complaining power by a determi
nation to {hew that its complaints are ground
less, or by examining the complaints and
the evidence in amicable negociation and de
ciding afterwards; let us examine all the com
plaints of France and then determine wheth
er they are all so frivolous as to excite irrita
, tion at the mere mention of them ; unless we
are thoroughly fatisfied that they are so, we
cannot vote the answer as it is reported ;
should we discover in such an examination
that some of our measures have been founded
at least in mistake, would it then be proper
to adopt the language of the address ; but
should we persist under such a possibility of
mistake, what do we risk, an evil much
more fatal than the worst that could follow
the most sober resolution we ean now adopt;
we risk the alternative of abandoning it af
ter a war in which we may be fuiTerers, and
after we may' have retarded the increasing
1 prosperity of oUr country, half an age : we
have an example before us in a nation that
was eager- to snatch at a remote pretext for
an assumed interference in her government,
we have seen that nation among the most
powerful and haughty in Europe, the most
vain of her dignity (real or unreal) the most
apt to interfere in the government of others,
we have seen her enter into a war, and we
have seen her driven to the lowest state of
humiliation, we have seen her obliged to
pursue the most abjeft means of solicitation
to obtain a peace from that very nation
whom (he had irritated to a warâand we
saw her more humiliated flill by the rejeftion
of those propositions which she had made to
obtain peace. Have we a better profpeft
than that nation ? Are our means equal to
hers ? are we indeed ready to embark in a
war, with France too, and present such a
lesson to the world as America at war with
France, after France has defeated the efforts
of all the world ! He again aflced, have we
the means ? Let gentlemen who are willing
to plunge us into that dilemma make the
reply : but let not gentlemen indulge in so
hateful a pifture ; but although we have no
he was flill against surrendering the
honor of our country. Fortunately no such
facrifice is demanded, no such measure is
necessary ; and were we ten times more des
titute even than we are, he should never
submit to our national degradation, were
there a power so insolent as to expeft it.
But let us examine whether we have not
been fubjeft to the common lot of human
fallibility in our measures ; let us to whom
peace is so desirable, from experience, from
principle, and from our natural love of hap
piness, and to whom the rifles of war would
be attended with such incalculable disasters,
enquire before we rush wantonly upon them,
whether it is raally clear that we have been
uniformly rightâwhether we have not been
sometimes wrong ? Suppose it (hould be
found that France has had some cause of
complaint, that some of her claims are foun
ded in reason, or even suppose that she only
earncftly thought so, and that she would
prove her sincerity ; are we to (hut our c-yes
and ears against an examination of these
complaints, are we -to leave no room for a.
fair and candid dlfcuflioÃ, such as may con
vince whichever may be the milta'>efl party ?
It wis he knew a very ungrjKSbw, and
often an unpopular tsfk, to difpl.iy tne er
rors of our own government : there was a
national vanity, a vain and unmeaning pride
which fought to be be bolstered up by frip
pery of word-i, and afts of diffimuiation, he
knew that this empty and pernicious vanity
often alfutlled the poll and place of the true
dignity of a"country, and blinked contume
ly on him that was rtifpoliwt to prefer the
plain, frank, open path of integrity .and
truth. He would chufe between these op
poiite paflions of a nation, and preferring
his duty to the appreheniion of unmerited
reproach, he would neither repress the fen
tirren's of his mind, nor fofter those which
he coneeived to be pregnant with ruin : he
would glory more in promoting the juftipe
of his country, than in condafting her to
the moll brilliant triumphs in an unjust cause.
He would therefore calmly examine whether*
France had just cause of complaint ; and
whether (he had or not a just he would
aflert that Frante might without exciting
indignatioir, think herfelf injured ; that (he
might, was a fufficient reason with him for
preferring the amendment, as it left an o
pening for rather amicable discussion and ac
commodation, than the report, which had
an opposite character.
In enumerating the complaints, it was
very true, that France had preferred many
which were not in themselves reasonable or
well founded ; but there were circumstances
in which France was liable to mistake as
well as ourselves ; the objefts presented
themselves in a delusive or adverse form, and
it was a fubjeft rather of regret, which we
should use as a warning to our own judgments
than a crime in her, if (he afted in the fame
way that (he (hould do when under the con
viftion and certainty of her rectitude ; when
(he was unconscious of her error.
The firft object of her complaint was the
interference of our courts in prize causes.
Was there no color of complaint on this
fubjeft ? He did not mean to enter into any
particulars of the cases that came before, or
the decisions in our courts, he only alluded
to the 17 th article of our treaty with France,
upon which she grounded this fubjeft of
complaint, " that it (hall be lawful for the
ships of war of either party, and privateers,
freely to carry whithersoever they please,
the (hips and goods taken from their ene
mies, without being obliged to pay any du
ty to the officers of the admiralty, or any
other judges; nor (hall prizes be arrested or
seized, when they come and enter the port
of each party ; nor (hall the searchers or o
ther officers of those places, search the fame
or make examination concerning the lawful
nefs of such prizes ; but they may hoist fail,
at any time, and depart, and carry their
prizes tn the places expressed in their com
missions, which the commanders of such
ships (hall be obliged to (hew ; on the con
trary, no (helter or refuge (hall be given in
their ports to such as (hall have made prizes
of the fubjefts, people, or property of ei
ther of the parties ; but if such shall come
in, being forced by stress of weather, or
the dangers of the sea, all proper means
(hall be vigorously used, that they go "out
and return from thence as soon as possible."
Every gentleman must fee, that the latitude
of this article was indeed very wide, so wide
that not even a searcher was permitted to go
on board, nor an officer of our admiralty enti
tled to a fee or duty nor any other of our jud
ges ; ought we to be surprized, that a nation
imperfeftly acquainted with the detail of
our municipal regulations and official duties,
(honld differ with us in the conflruftion of
this article, after our detention of their pri
zes, in the discussions that have taken place
already on this article ; the difference of in
terpolation is not at all surprising ; they
have said to,your courts, we allow their due
jorifdiftion, tout as treaties are fuprcme laws,
osr prizes not have.been fuffered to
enter your courts ; according to this article,
you fubjeft us to tedious delays, nor involve
us in litigious fuitl, but your Executive
(hould have decided in a summary way, and
not kept our armed (hips idle and expenGve
to us; he would not fay that in this con
tlrudion France was right, or that our courts
were wrong, far from it ; all .he wifiied the
Committee to consider, was whether France
might not without great violation of rea
soning toneeive herfelf tight, and accor
dingly ilaim of us such an explanation an
might place us clear of any suspicion of
designed wrong, tewardi her in violation of
that treaty.
The second complaint was our admiflion of
veffils hostile to France, and that made pri
zes, into our ports, contrary to the last part
of the fame article ; and France had also
conilrued this one way a,nd our Executive
anotherâbut was a mistake a cause of hosti
lity ? (hould the mistake be oursj would
France be juftifiable in hostility marely on
account of the mistake ; and (hould we be
any more juftifiable to rifle hostility, rather
than enter upon discussion.
Another cause of complaint was the con
veifion of our neutrality into an injurious
hostility, by out indifferent fufferance of the
impressment of our fesraen by Great Britain,
by which her enemy became-poffirfled of our
force and employed them against her, while
we were on terms of the molt intimate and
friendly alliance, and they were embarked in
a cause common with our own ; they com
plain of this indifference very ftrorgly, and
it must be acknowledged that no open inter
ference took place 011 cur part upon that fe
riou9 ftiljtft to ourfelves,and important to us
as a nruuai nstios, until the latter end of
1796, except a few lines (rom our minister,
Thomas Pinckney, in a letter to lord Greti
viJle in the summer of that year ; from so
long a filenec on fuaii a fubjeft, was it fur
rifing that Fiance (hould entertain doubts
of our disposition to prcfetveour neutrality,
was it surprising that die fliould consider
Tome hidden but unaccountable change hav
ing taken place in the attachment of the U.
States ; was it surprising, or a matter cillipg

Under the m3irt object of the British trea
ty, which is o::e of the complaints of France,
there are f-veral Jubordinate parts ; the fiift
jj that of the abandonment of that principle

Testis factifice the fapreme advantages which
our commerce would derive from its mainte

'apparent adversity, could (lie fee this and still

the United States rtlinquifhing it in any
treaty with another nation ; he would by and
by examine the principle ; now he would â fuf
fer it to be argued the contiaiy principle)â
that the right us seizure of enerry's properly
on neutral (nips, was the universal and re
ceived law ; was it the'aftuaily received law ?
Then if it was, how came it to be made a
part of that formal negotiation, jnd to con
llitute an article of the Briiiih treaty ,'Wliy
introduce it so unguardedly there if it wss al
ready the universal and indisputable law ? But
we had even exceeded that law, for we hai
admitted the right to carry our (hips into
their por!3 merely on suspicion, a concession
which was not even presumed to be authori
zed by any law or ufageof civilized nations ;
aconceffion wlich neither went to profit our
felvea, nor to ameliorate our condition ss *
neutral nationâif the principles were even
fixed htfore, was it an evidence of out ami
ty, of our tenacious regaid or our own dig
nity, or of a seriously ncntral difpobiien to
conclude these novel moderations, which
went to fetter our commerce with the most
perplexing (hackles.
But let us enquire whether it is ferioully the
law of nations ? and in making this enquiry it
is not from patched-ideas, halt quotations, or
l'craps of learned opinions parcelled out and bot
ched or fubterfuge, that we must dcciije , if
upon this examination we (hovid find realiil e
ven to fufpefl our error, and that we have
conceded any llifng to Great Britain rojitrary
to that law, it will b? surely a fubflantiii feafou

the law of nations is fdnndei 0."? certain usages
of nations at various periods, and upen the fti- '
pulations of treaties of nations with eacs ether j
these laws were either partial or geneifl, and
the latter have hern the fubjeft of temmsn
claim among ualions ; now in ll! that
has been written oirthofe laws he knew of none,
which had received ihe common ajfoutofall
nations, or of nearly all, authorizing the fei
zuie cf enemy's property on free (hips; the
principle had been repeatedly af
though ialiad been often tvaiJed, it had never
been difpvoved, that a (hip of a neutral nation
fliould be asfacred as its territory; wherever
the flag of a r.eutral nation waves that fnould
be sacred, and goods seized on board a feutral
(hip is as much a violation of the universal law
as the seizure on the neutral land cculd be ;
why is it that belligerent nations are precluded
from the (eizurc of the goods of an enemy in a
neutral port, betaufe it would be a violation of
the neutral right! ; do thei'e rights depart from
the citizens'ol free dated upon their departure
from their o-wn ports ? It is too abfurdto'ex
pe&any oiherbut the plain reply. B:;'. if we
cannot find the decision in the tomes of the civ.l
-ian, Ictus lfcok elsewhere ; let us lo k into the
treaties : and here we may obtain si me fatisfac
tory ted upon which w? may reft the quel*ion;
prior to the war of our revolution, the treaties
of European nations were a ferics of cpntradic
tory aflertions and denials of known principles ;
the fame principles were afFerted in one treaty
of the fame nation, which were faci oieed to
partial inter:fts in another ; the spirit of mo
nopoly of trade corrupted-the current of univer
sal law ; and local situation, a temporary ftra
tsgem, or an ambitious project sealed what the
other had negotiated ; but i<Â» the midftof war,
Europe saw irife a eomtvnation of neutral pow
ers who were resolved to restore the laws of na
tions to their primitive principles from the in
tolerable atfkife into which they had fallen ; and
they declared that principle which no nation
ought to deny ; Ruflia finding that the depre
dations which the belligerent powers were torn
raitting on her commerce, furpafled all bounds
of juftite, notifitd to the other r.eutral powers
in herfirft declaration her purpofc to ascertain
and fix the principles which neutral nations
ought to cbferve toward those at war and reci
procally, and expreflcj herfelf thusâ" pbe
" does this with the greater confidence, as (he
" finds those principles founded on the ii iÂ»ii
" tivelawof nations, which everyone may hive
" recourse to, and which the bell gtrcin powpa.
" cannot invalidate wUhout violating the laws
" of neutrality, and disavowing maxims which

this is a private compail, and that the agreeing

â aufwer me, is the principle inconsistent with i;ea

ot nations,'is it not binding upon evtry natioii
who fubfcrilred to or adopted it; âuntil gentle
men deny this, I (hall fairly conclude that it is
the tiue and genuine law of nations ; but it will
b< Ciid, there is one power which did not agree
to that convention, ami therefore the agreement
of all the reft is invalidatedâwill this indeed
be infixed upon, is it because one haughty, cÂ»

But it iÂ« ("aid, thk declaration of the armed,
neutrality is only a teriporary, and not a per- "
inanent compaft, and xve (hall be told that this ti
Terrion is fupportcd by an article of the treaty d

principal officers of a government, he believtd
the like was not to he fotfnd in the annals of the ,
inoft vicious policy in any nation 7 in that let
ter the 9th article of the armed neutral conven- F
tion is thus quotedâ" The Convention being a

article ; wai it to be supposed that our nimilter r
of State could obtain only a mutilated copy us [
this important hillorica! record I âthe article t
concludes with this weighty and important de- ; |
tlaration, which our Secretary has entirely o- j
mi\ted â" These llipulations fnali further be :
" considered as permanent, and (hall decide 1 {
" in ALL MATTIRS of Commerce and Ka-viga- \ '
" tion ; and in (hort in every f ase where the 1
" rights of neutral nations are to be determined.' 1 I
But a gentleman has told us this principle <
of the armed neutrality cannot be a true one ? 1
and why v ? truly because the fame Empress J 1
of Ruflia who was at the head of the con- i ;
federation, has, during the present war, ea- j j
tered into a treaty with that power which |
formerly denied the principle, and had herfelf ;
agreed to contravene it ; and further, that 1
Spain had acceded to that contravention ;
that this conduft of that Empress and of
is a melancholy proof of the captici
oufnefs and indability of arbitrary councils
and of rations, he was ready to confefs ;
but he did not fee upon what ground this
partial dereliftion of right principles (hould
f,o to the universal establishment of wrong :
France in the convulsions of her revolution
had alarmed all Europe, and Britain always
jealous of her power, and much more of that
power under the influence of liberty, had
entered into an engagement with Ruflia to
(la.rve France, and Spain accedes to this pur
pose ; but tinder what cireumdances; under
the proclaimed avowal of the measure being
adopted, because the revolution of France
was a new cafe ; a flame had been lighted up,
as they called ir, which threatened to des
troy all Europe ; and to quench this flame
they agree to overturn thÂ« law of nations,
whiÂ»h if obeyed or regarded, would counte
raft the designs of England and the withes
of RuQiaand Spain.
But we are tsld that our government has
receded from this principle on a former oc
cafioÃ, and had declared it in Â«ur correspon
dence with _ Genet ; but he would a(k any
gentleman, does a dSte alter a principle ?
Do principles of right and wrong alter with
the seasons of the years ? If we abandoned
it then or at this day, what is that to France ;
(he tells us we have done it, and acknow
ledge it is done ; thus the quedion is then
reduced to this pointâHave tut done right ?
This quedion unfortunately does not reft
with our partialities to decide j it not only
reds upou tfee powers of Europe whom it
may implicate or concern, but upon our own
formal recogmtion& acceflion tothe principles
of the armed neutrality, nay with the com
pltmenr3 expressed by oar government to the
Etaprefs of Ruflia for promoting it; upon
our ascepting of this principle too at a peri
od in which we manifefted that eur love of.
justice was in perfeft consonance with that
loveof liberty which then engaged us in our
revolution ; upon <*ir aceefÂ»tanceof it when
it was calculated to operate mod seriously to
,our difudvantage by depriving us of the sup
plies which could be thereby kept from us ;
' it msttars not then what date, or in what
manner we felinquiflied it, ifhaving formally
received it we abandoned it to the disadvan
tage and injury of our allies and of other
previously subsiding treaties ; we have un
qucftionably done this evil, perhaps from no
malign dispositionâbut it was our duty, hav
ing committed the error, to reftify it | it
had been urged that we had been compelled
to abandon the principle or go to <war with
Britain ; and we had cholen it as the alter
nativeâwhat compelled I he w*nld not dis
cuss this unhappy argument âwe have in
flifted a wound on our commercial neutrality,
but what is much worse on our national cha
rafter, which he feared we (hould sever re
cover.
Another fiipula,tion is contained in the
British treaty relative to provisions, which
admits the Britiih, contrary to the law of
nations, to seize upon our vessels going to
France ; it is said that this aitide does not
i admit any new principle, and that indead as
ijeing disadvantageous to Ftartce, (he is put
Â«u'a better footing than before 1 He would
read the article ; the firft paragiaph of the
i3th article after defining the new extension
of what (hall thereafter be deemed contra
band, proceeds in the fccond thusâ" and
41 whereas the difficulty of judging of the
" precise cases in which alone provisions and
â¦â¢other articles not generally contraband may
" be regarcvd as such, rendets it expedi
" ent to prÂ»vide againd the inconveniences
" and rnifundcrftandings which might thence
â¢' arise : It is further agreed that whenever
" any such articles fa becoming contraband ac
" cording to the cxiding law of nations, fiiall
" for that reason befeized, the fame (hall not
" be, confiscated, but the owners thereof (hall
*' be speedily and completely indemnified ;
" and the captors, or in their default the Goâ¢
" f rnm:nt uadcr whose suihority they aft,
" (lull pay to the mailer, orownerf, of fuc!i
" vtffel, the full valu? of al! arjiulcs, wi"h a
" reasonable mercantile profi' thareon, toge
" ther wiih tlie freight, aud alf>< the demur
" rage incident to the detention." Our
treaty in the subsequent pjÂ»ra;r ra p',j reeapi _
tulates the ordinary provifiuu for the circum- Fl
Itances attending (hips peoceediug through
error or inattention, to blockaded ports, but
in the above ftjpulations a new principle is
foijled into the law of nations, far which we rc
are to receive the full price of aur articles and ~fe
a reqfonable mercantile profit ; and after doing tl
this we are told, that we place our ally in a A
better condition than (he was beforeâthat
the power of her enemy to seize our snips,
which are protested by the law of Rations f 0
from seizure having nothing contraband on ai .
board, when going to the ports of abellige- tl
rent power not blockadedâis an advantage W
to that power so deprived ; we might admit' L
what is not a faft, in the firil it! dunce that a '
provisions are contraband, and we accept c<
coiripenfation for our facrificc of the univer
fa! law ; we admit the inhuman and horrid ft
principle, that one nation has a right to darve p
another at its discretion, and while thus con w
niving at, and profiting by the collusion, as- M
fed to be indignant when remondrance or "j
resentment flow from the injured nation ; this *
is the lad and afHifting picture of enorinto
which we have been blindly fcJuced ! Of all i
the authors that have written on the law of o
nations, there is not oneâno, not one, that 0
supports the idea of provifiops befog liable P
. to the dcfci.iption of contraband, in any cafe
; but in approaching a blockaded pott ; the t
j only author indcedthat mentions such a thing a
i even in the way of suggestion, who a
| fays, that possibly there may be a cafe where h
there is a reasonable hope of reducing a nation
by want of provisions, they may be deemed ''
contraband ; but this is delivered as a mete '
fuggellion, and contrary to his usual difFuTo- ;
> ness he leaves it naked and unsupported by
j any one htftorical example or reference ; Lut
| gentlemen fay, we do not alio v provisions to j
be contraband, although Vattcl has used this ! ;
suggestion, we think the doftrine unfounded; !
but he would not dispute about opinions j
while he had rafts, and he would fay, while ' i
you have denied the doftrine you have allow- j )
ed the praftice; you not only do wrong c
thereto France, but we have done it in the 1 f
moll offcnfive formâand irritated as (he ' i
mud be by the intrigues that have already <
torn her for so many years, the foreign ma- I
chinations and the efforts to subjugate her by (
all the arts which perfidy could fuggefl, we t
(hould not be surprised if (he (hould be relu'c- i
tantly led to believe, that we had thus bar- l
teied our supplies to Britain, reckless of her <
ruin and regardless of our treaties ; I fay (he . i
may be reluftantly led to believe this, since i
the error of our blindness or our weakness is i
visible as noon day. ! \
But we are told that this dipulation is ad- i
vantageous to France, as it holds out a temp- 1
lation to mercantile adventurers from the ;
certainty of payment in v either event of a voy- j
age ; for his part he could net discover in the <
conduit of the ncgociation, nor in the treaty j
itfelf, any such intention on our part ; âbut (
he could fee in the facrifice an effort, and he i
! would aflc any gentleman haw far fuccefsful
it had proved, to guard against British depre
dations j but he could fee in the argument a
weak effort to support a tvotfe meafute !
But let us fee what is the conftru&ion of our
, own government upon this principle | it mud
[ be telted by other fafts tlian its adoption or
; rejeftion in a treaty; since the execution of
the treaty our Execntive has put a strong
i conltruftion on this principle; but our Ex -
Â» ecutive had also, in a letter of isllruftion to
t Mr. Thomas Pinckney, expressed his fenti
r ments equally pertinent but confpicuousâ
fpeaking of the orders of the Britiih govern
i ment for seizing provisions in neutral (hips,
3 the firtl article of which was in theft; words ;
. " That it (hall be lawful to (top and retain
; " all vessels loaded wholly or in part with
i " corn, flour, or meal, bound to any port in
" France, or any port occupied by the ar
f. " mies of France, and to fend them to fueh
t " port as (hall be mod convenient, in order
â  " that such corn, meal, or flour, may be
i " purchased on behajf of his majefly's gt*-
3 " vernment, and the (hips be released after
. " such purchase, and after due allowance for
; " freight, &c. .
t The Executive thus notices the order,
jr " this aft too tends direftly to draw us from
- " that (late of peace in which we are wishing
r " to remain : It is an essential charafter of
. " neutrality, to furni(h no aids (not (lipu
o " lated by treaty) to one party, which we
" are not equally bound to furnilh to another,
t " If we permit corn to be sent to Great
d " Britain and her friends, we are equally
h " bound to permit it to France. To re
" drain it would be a partiality which would
f. " lead to a war,*vith France ; and between
i- " redrainiog it ourselves and permitting her
" enemies to redrain it unrightfully is no
i- " differenceâShe would consider this as a
s . " mere pretext, of which (he would not be
'â¢ the dupe, and on what honorable ground
e " could we otherwise explain it ? Thus we
I " thorized aft of Great-Britain, into a war
0 " with which we meddle not, and which we
)t " wish to avoid, if justice to all parties will
f " enable us to avoid it." Now, fir, if go
vernment thought France wonld not be the
dupe of an artifice then, what reason have we
to believe that die will now ? Let gentlemen
n who are eager for the report, reply and (hew
wherein the dillinftion lies. In 1793 our
j Execntive conlide: ed it as a caitfe of war on
1C ly to permit the infraflion of that law of na
j tions, or the partial supply of one or other
y party with provisions; and are we to expeft
j_ France, to whom we were at lead under some
ties of regsrd, not to fay obligation, (hould
tamely condescend not to notice our facrifices
, r thus made ; gentlemen would not be serious
, _ and expeft it.

NOTE. , c
The flatement of Mr. Harper's speech in
Markland and Carey's paper of yefti-rday, is
perfeiffly falfe in all its parts. He said not one 1
word to nrge a com.non cause or an alliiÃce Â«
with England, nor did he make the most dillant t
insinuation that there were French ptrnfioners in ;
the house or out of it, much less of their being j
paid out of the fpoiiations. t
Mr. Harper was so far from urging an early
declaration of war, that he expressly declared hi >
objedt to be the avoiding of war, which in his <
opinion was belt to be done by negotiation, sup- '
ported by measures of effeflual defence. 1
His mention of Spain, Holland and Belgium j
was merely by way of warning and example to 1
this country ; and when he adverted to Mexico (
and the Floridas, it was to fiiew that France
and her allies had too much to lose by war for '
her to think feirioufly of driving us into one. 1

Cursory Thoughts on the true Policy of the \
United States.
%
MR. rrNNO,
IT may not, perhaps, be improper for the
1 public to turn their attention to the immediate
operation and confequenccs of a fyftcm, em
braced by a set of men who would impose
â  themselves upon the people, under the capti
vating names of Patriots or Republicans.â
men, if we are to judge from their conduit and
conversation, lay it down as an invariable
> principle, that every military and naval me a
1 sure, to put the United States in a situation
I to repel foreign insults and attacks, ought to
f be refilled by the reprefentaiives, and depre
" cated by the people. This truth is so nototi
: ous, that it would be a wade of time towefer
â¢ to those documents vhith contain so many
â  inltances of the faft.
f In every European war, by which the in
terest of the United States, or any of their
rights of sovereignty maybe involved, an ad
1 herenee to this principle neceflarily and una
r voidably leads to one of two results ; firlt,
3 " To a fubmiffton to every aggrejjion or insult
a which may be attempted or infliHid upon them,
c by any of the belligerent powers." Or, fecoud,
" the alfilute neccjjity of the United Slates
e throwing themftlvrt upon the protection of one
- of thefepowers, in order to prcfcrve their rights
r or interefk from beingfwallowed up or drjlroyed
e by the other." This pofii ion being supported
'' by the experience of all ages, it would be
matter of surprise to fee it prattifd upon in the
c United States, did not the fame experience
e inform us, that there has been always fount.',
n in every country, men who, either from mo
" tives of ambition, or some special cause rela
r tive to themselves, have opposed or defeated
'* thÂ»fe measures which alone could have saved
â¢ their country from ruin or dependance.
'' Let us speak plain ia treating on this sub-
jeft. Is it intended, for example, should
ie England commit depredations on our trade,
d contrary to the laws of nations and treaty, tu
â¢ s submit to the injuries without an attempt at
" defence, or to implore France to take onr
trade under her protection t Would not this be
to make France the protestor of the United
States and the arbiter of their fate ? On the
other hand, (hould fpoiiations be committed
on our trade by France, contrary to expref
4 ' Imputations and to the law of nations, can the
United States submit to receive the proteClion
jof Finland, without fjibmictli:CT to fimilir
drpendance and humiliation ? What is the
courf.-that qught to be purfurd in fuJi a
state of things': What the position which the
United States ought to assume to avoid so
mortifying, and eventually ruinous a depend
ance ? Is it to be effefted by envoys extraor- '
dinary, by conccjfions, by relinquinfbmcnts, by j
humiliations; or is it to be by .
drawing upon the resources of the country, and l
converting them into a maritime vnd landforce i
competent to yield protection, and fufficirnt t
toinfpire a re'uÃance in either ofm'-e contend i
ing power) to wound pur rights, left we
should be thrown into the scale of their enemy ? ,
Is the latter the policy the United States
ought to puifue ? Yes, it is the only policy
which can procute to them that coif dera
tion to which they ere entitled, and to ir.y fel
low-citizens that freedom which I tr:.jl they 1
would sooner die than relinquish.
Should the councils of those men prevail, ,
who are for keeping the United States with- ,
out a naval and military defence, what have i
we to fear during the prejrnt war, and what <
to dread upon its termination ? It ii vain to
exp?& from any million to Fiance that our 1
trade to the Fionch Weft-India islands will
be placed in a better fitnation than it is. at
present, or that while it is left unprotected in
that quarter by our own ships, it will not con
tinue to be plundered. Humiliation and ,
conceflkw may indeed prevent its fullering
equal injuries ir. the European and other seas;
but nothing short of an armed force can cover
it from the buccaneers of the Welt-Indies.â
During the exiltence of the wat, therefore, a
naval and military army cannot be dispensed
with, without relipquifhing every thing tu
chance and the good will of a horde of foreign
plunderers, aided by the bankrupts 3nd out.
cafta from our own society. To Ihefe evils
we mult submit ; by such buccaneers & out
calls our citizens mud be plundered, fllould
falfe fyllems, erroneous spiuions, or any other
motive induce thole men to withhold defence,
who alone have the power to create it.
If unfortunately a system of inaction should
prevail, to what a condition do we fubjedt
the United States at the close of the war ?
Should France emerge from it the dominating
power, and England be in 110 situation to
prevent her farther aggrandizement, we may
iindoHifelves suddenly awakened fromourfleep
of security by a treaty between France and
Spain, which mull plunge us into a war to
preftrve the unity of our country. Who can
1 doubt of the views of Fiance and Spain up
on the weflern and southern parts of the uni
ioh ? On the other hand, should England
ride out the storm and rife upon its ruins to
greater power and consequence, Ihe may put
forth pretenfiont, fthich are at present dor
mant, and require of the United States con
cessions or alliance which, if granted, mult
humble us in our own eyes and in the eyes
of all the world.
To avoid then the calamities of war, and
to secure to ourselves a position at its termina
tion which may prevent either of the belliger
ent powers from taking advantage of our
weakness, found policy requires that we should
adopt inflantaneous measures of defence, and
that we should be found prepared for war, at
a time when all Europe may seem desirous
of repose.
The distance of the United States from the
three European powers, with whieh they are
mod likely to be entangled in disputes, and
to whose colonies they are so contiguous, ena
bles them to aflame a refpeitable position
with means very difproportionedf theirs, anil
yet truly competent to secure them against
their attacks, or to annoy or reduce some of
their polTeffions If attacked. Such a position
may be maintained at a small cxpenfe ; and
till such be taken the United States mull
oontinue to be inful.'ed, abused and plundered
by thefc powers, as often as it fliali be their
, interell to violate their treaties, and set at
nought '.he laws of nations, jnflice aritl hu

' In the House of Reprefehtatives Yes
terday (the House having again formed
; itfelf into a Committee of the whole on
the Answer Reported to the President's
' speech, and Mr. Nicholas's amendment being
underconfideration) Mr. Harper resumed his
observations against the amendment, which
he delivered at great length. Mr. Gallatin
1 followed him, on the contrary fide, and ha
-1 ving noticed some remarks which fell from
Mr. Harper, that gentleman rose to explain.
The call for the " Committee to rife," and for
r the " Quc/lion," from different parts of the
' House became very loud ; when Mr Giles
rose and faiJ" the gentleman last up had
thrown out insinuations of mifconduiS a
r gainlt (he foppofed) one of our late public
functionaries in France. Insinuations of a
similar kind he had frequently heard out of
' doors, but he tha't them unworthy of no
' tice; but asthe gentleman had tho't proper
' to introduce the calumny in that Ilunfe, &
' as he was a friend of his, and not here to
' answer far himfelf, he wifiied to know
" of the gentleman, whether it was to him he
J alluded, and if it were, he called upan him
; for proof of his assertions. Mr. Harper le
plied, that he did allude to that gentleman,
e and would, at a proper time, produce evi
' dencc of what he had laid. The Chairman
e reminded the gentlemen that this conversation
' was out of order. The confufsd call of the
" Committee to rife" and the "
] was again revived ; when the motion for the
committee to rife, was put and negatived,
there being only Thirty in favor of it. The
qaeftion on Mr. Nicholas's amendment was
then put and negatived, there being 48
votes for it, and $2 against it. Mr. New
' moved that the House meet in future at ten
0 in the morning, the motion was negatived,
there being only 36 in favor of it.
