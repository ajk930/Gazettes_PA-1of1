ork j-p fema j n , now to coofider the pacific meafurcs,
i as Hampden call's them, which Mr. Jefferfon re
' commended to Congress, while Secretary of State,
to the perfidious conduit of Great-Bri- ,
joi! tain, raeafures which he asserts, would have been
more advantageous than those which have taken
iffia place; this confidcration will neccffarily involve a ,
confideratiou of the diplomatic talents And political ;
figacity of the Secretary, which are asserted, by j
i; ns Hampden, to be not inferior to his republicanism ,
and unalterable attachment to liberty, (
These themes of panegyric are comprized fn the c
6th and jth divifwni of Hampden's Essay. a
As to the 9th and last, viz. " Mr. Jerfferfons' a
poffefling a fortune no less independant than his prin. j
ciples," it is so extraordinary a fubjeft of rdcom- j
mendationin.the quarter from which it comes, and
as applied tn this limple republican and zealousaa- t
mirer of irquality, that we are at a loss to account f
for its flipping into this panegyric ; we (hall only
ads remark, that, in this rcfpeÂ£t Mr. Adams nuift yield
to Mr. Jefferfqn ; the former, having a large fami t
ly and a fmill fortunedaes certainly not boast of the t
ins pecuniary advantages of the latter, who has a very,
UIC I small family arid an independent fortune,
egj Among the advantages which may result from ft
this foperioritV of riches, that of being able to attach p
to a chief magistrate ufeful imd zealous fuppsrtirs f (
of his adminiftratinn, will not be the leait important. f
And if a salary of only two hundred and fifty dol- n
lars, on a former oceafion, could procure fHch sup- (l
port, what may not be expected from the independ
p ent fortune of a Piefident, the whole of which p
â might conveniently by applied to the pensioning of

The .Executive Directory of France keep in y,
their pay regular Journalists, who publish their pro- rc
ceedings, vindicate them from attacks and endeavor C e
to -write down their afTailants. These Journals are
called the Official Journals of the Directory, and m
are known to colt the government an imraenfe sum ti
annually. j 1(
or We cannot then doubt, that with so ufeful a tii
lesson before his eyes, and not scrupulous about the
ueaos, iÂ£ they attain certain ends, a~rich President, t h
devoted to every thing which comes from tfiat coun- ar
try, not being yet allowed to apply the public mo- v ,
nev to fiich purposes, will find a valuable aid in his "
private refourcea. Having just reason to dread the bf
severe displeasure of the people for molt of his mea- ag
fures, it cannot be doubted that Writers will be m
kept in pay to vindicate his official conduit, .and to f 0
defame his opponents. q
With refpeft >o the measures recommended by co
Mr. Jefferfon, telounteraft those of Great-Bri- G
t. tain; they are so connected with his correspondence 0 f
with Mr. Hammond refpedting the non-execution
of the Tieaty of Peace, that, in order to have a c ] s
complete view of the fubjeft, it will be proper to M
advert a little to that correspondence, for which he R,
n has received so much applanfe from his Panegy- f m
ie rifts.
Â® It is not intended- to deny to Mr. Jefferfon tlyr tm
S merit of having devoted considerable pain* to the f o j

approbation for some /kill and ingenuity in com- we

talents and his diplomatic (kill and ingenuity much
'j greater than they are admitted to be, by all those ] et |
v who have examined his works with more than a wo
, Superficial view, and are capable of judjririg of their OUI
c real merit, (till those talents and that (kill offer but agi
(lender pretensions for so high and important a ftati- b a t

m Â«tremely injudicious and unwise then was it to de
a clare, not only in his letter to Ger.ct but to Mr

TOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UN ITED irÂ«rÂ£S.
To the Ele&ou of the President of the United
â¢ Stares.
Refpeflable fellow-citizens,
WHATEVER may be the relult of your ap
proaching deliberations, the interetts of this coun
try cannot fail to have been promoted by many ot
the difcuflions to which this great occasion will have
given rife. The numetous addresses to the peopiS
at large, to the state legiflaturee, and to yourfelvts,
will often bring truth and reason into the public
view, or expose to detefliort the improper measures
which piffion or unworthineis have induced tbs
parties to adopt. .
It is plain that those, who have necessarily reply
m a very late Lour have far the hardc.l talk, thoughtruth were admitted to bean their fide. Nothing,
which can be prepared, for example, to manifeft aa
the errors of " Phocion," can poflibly reach in time
the distant Electors.
The opinions of Mr. Adams in favor of an he.
reditaiy President and of an hereditary senate, and
his desire tp fee them introduced among us, are
the great objeSions to him, which prevail copclu
fively with all tlfc friends of the Federal Conftitu
t tiou, who are opposed to hii election. Hence we
fee, that though Mr. Pinc'ney is underflood to be
fit up by the fame persons, no objections whatever
have been made to him. This gentleman gives rife
to no alarms even among the fiier.ds of Â»ther can 1
didate., because he is um'veifally admitted to be a
friend to reprefentat'vse or eleSive government. Nay, (
even the papers, charaftsWzed as Anti federal and I
Jicobin, hive not founded any alarm concerning j -
the Republican Pinckney.
The friends and enemies of the Federal Conftitu- -
* lion have been accustomed to believe, that Gene
ral Washington is j lover $f rtprefentative gt
vsrnment. It has been a cause of a devout tbank
fulnefs to Providence in the minds of serious and
anxiwus men, that this friend to Republics was in t j
the chair, when the combined powers afTociated to
reltore Monarchy in France, and particularly in "
1793, when the of Great.Britain iflued <<
within the fame week (Oil. 31, and Nov. 6, '93)
a publlb proclamation tofuppufs Republican govern- n;
ment in France, and feeret orders holfile to the re- |j
fjurccs and naval organ of our unoffending Republic.
Here we might offer exculpa-ory conecrn.
log the difpufitions, which of eirciim
(tances like these naturally excite in the bo-
fom of secretary Jeffcifon, perhaps we mig*t fully Ni
establish his merit on the occafioH ; but is only V
Beccflnry to our present argument to sbferve, that A
the friends of our Republican Conttitution felt E
great comfort, at a moment so awfully eventful, in B
the knowledge, that Our chief magistrate was an C
indisputable enemy to every modification of hcredi C;
taty domination. If t'he fneads of representative Pt
I y government cbcrifted with thankfulnefs this cum- H
fortable ttuth, what will they now think and feci, W
if they behold the high presidential authority in El
the hands of one, who has no faith, no cbnfideuce D
# ill reprefentativc or eledive government, who be- W
lieves, with the jealous enemies of our Conftitu- , St
tion abroad, that a Monarchical Constitution it not
only better than our Federal Conllitutian, but that
â a mixed Monarchy is >â¢ \hc befl of all pojfiblt go- cit
, vernmems." Ask yourselves. refpedable but highTT tai

sages, in faror of hereditary government, which a
wife and zc-alous advocate would (if tic could) have
openly seized and refuted. This is a cafe in which
the very horns of the adverfaiy, if w e may ufethe
expression, should have been taken hold of with in
trepidi'tjr. " Pijflcion," of referviag alumft
entirely for Mi. Jefferfon a pen, whieh alas'he hat
unconfdoufly fteeptd in the acidulated gall offelf
deceivinjrpr <ji 1 d ice, should have explained the many
pTlages like the following, which arc to be found ,
in Mr. Adams's three volumes.
In treating of the Laaedcmonian 'government,
which was hereditary in the lings and fen atur3, in
the two hundred ind fifty-fifth pai je of the firlf
volume, Mr. Adams writes the following words
" The Lacedemonian Repnblic may then, with Si
great propriety, be willed Monarchical, and had O
the three essential parts of the best possible govern
| _ ment; it was a mixture of Monarchy, Atillocracy
and Democracy." This pi-foge is unequivocal and n

fronts on two of the public squares; from these prawings-l
it is proposed to ered two centre and four comer buildings, j
as soon as poflible after this lottery is fold, and to convey j
them, when complete, to the fortunate advenmrtrs, in
the manner described in the fchemc for the Hotel Lottery.
A nettdeduflion of fiiwper cent, will be made to defruy j
the necessary expenses of printing, Second the iurplus
will be made a part of the fund intended for the National
University, to be creaed within the city of Waflungton. Sgl j .
The Drawing will commence ?s soon as the tickets art I
fold off.âThe laoney prizes will be payable in thirty days 1
after it is finifked ; and any prtfei for which fortunate j <
numbers arc not produced within twelve months after the I
drawing isdofed, are to be considered as given towards | ror ra ,(j
the fund for thd University ;it being determined I to/fettle ihe L
the whole business in a year from the elding of the draw- I feffio.
ing, and to take up the bonds given as fecunty. Schu>
The real fecufit.es given for the payment of the Pnzes, Berk,
are held by the President and two Dirtf&ors of the Bank 1 .
of Columbia, and ate valued at more than halt the a
mount of the lottery. , f ,
The twenty four gentlemen who by appointment of 4
the late CommilÃoners aflilled in the management ol the
Hotel Lottery are requested to undertake tbisardu oust aft: g D
a l'econd time on behalf of the public ; a iufficieiit num teo
ber of these having kindly accepted, it is hoped that the
friends to a National University and the other federal ob- ,
lefts mar continue to favor the design.
By accounts received from tJhe different parts of the {
Continent as well as from Europe, where the tlckets
have been sent for sale, the public are affared that tliÂ« g<<>o
drawing will speedily commence, and that the cart alld
caution unavoidably necessary to'infure a fafe difpoiall ol
thÂ« tickets, has rendered the iter: -suspension indilpenlabU.
