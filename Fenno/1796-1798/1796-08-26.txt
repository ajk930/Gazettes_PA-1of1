A very valuable Merchant Mill,
\ DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and furidry STONE
il QUARRIES to be let
I will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po
t'owmac, for aoy term not lÂ«fs than seven, nur more than
eleven years, from the firft day of September next. The
mill-noufe is 41 by 46 feet, three stories high, built with
stone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two
J overshot 18 feet water-wheels, and Evans's machinery
complete, with every other thing proper and necessary for
carrying on the business with dilpatch. and at as little ex
t penle as possible, all in good order.âFrom the mill to my
landing 011 the Potemac river, (wheris craft, of any bur
- then may deliver grain and take in flour) it is about 40
yards, and from thence by water tn George-Town and
the City of Walhingtoa, about 3 miles, and to Alexan
dria about 11 miles. This situation, aided by a fufficient
capital, will command the produce of a very extensive
back country, where large quantities of wheat and other
Â» grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8
to 10 miles less than to any market town upon the navi
gation of the Potowmac. There are on the premises a
large ft#ne Coopers' ihÂ«p, a stone granary, and a commo
dious miller's house. At the landing alorefaid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, which is in great for
wardriefs and probably will be finilhed the ensuing fall.
There are also on the premises, a Brewery and Distille
ry, built with stone, in them are three stills, two coppers
or boilers, with every ncceflary article, all new, and in
good order, and fufficiently large to carry on the Brew
ery and Distillery upon a very extenfivi plan. This prop-'
erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my laHds adjoining the premises, and along the
- banks of the river, where cr'aft may lead with eal'e and dil
patch, is an i-nmenfe quantity ol building and lounda
tion-ftonet. Four quarries are now open, and as many
more may be opened with eafc : the stone taken from thele
quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries
. separately or together as may best suit.
On the top of the hill, and about aoo yards from the
mill, is a stone Dwelling-hoyfe, large enough for the ac
- commodatioa of a family : also, a kitchen, dairy, fiuoke
- house, 4cc. and a garden, enclosed aad in cultivation, the
foi of which is equal in goodness to any in this state. I
will also reat this property.
Adjoining to the Brewery and Distillery is a Smith's
lhop, in which is a complete set of Blacksmith's tools,
S which 1 will also rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
tenant two negro blacklxniths, one of them is a complete
workman.
Ii I rent out the stone quarries', I will fell three crafts,
which wei e built for the pUrpÂ®fe of carrying stone : they
, will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch. Immediate
poffcfTion will be given. For terms apply to the l'ubfcrib
er in this town.
The Mill, Brewery and Distillery, with their appurten
ances, will be delivered to the tenant or tenants in good
repair, and mutt be so returned, at the expiration of the
Icale or leases.

The Pacha of Achra, furnamed Gezzar or the ,
Ravenous, to defignatehis ferocious ch <raÂ£Ur r has |
raifrd the ftandaid of rebellion in Asia, because he |
had been di%>!aced by the Grand Signior, who juil ,
ly felt indignant at the cruelties committed by that ,
raonller in the government under his orders.
The Pacha having fortified Acra, has put him
felf at the head of a band of bvigantfc, and took '
the towns of Kaffa and Rama, which form part of
the government of Damask ; he fpteads devastation j
and death in those unfortunate countries. I
Thirty years ago, this individual was Bey (Go
vernor of a town or province in Egypt) of Cairo ; j
lie stirred up a rebellion agairA the famous Aly (
Bey, then Governor of Egypt, and put him in ,
pnfon ; but being fubdutd by the other Beys he ,
fled to Damask, where - he afterwards kept a coffee- ]
hou'fe. The Pacha of Damask, who knew his mi- ,
litary talents, employed him during the war against ,
.the Ruffians, and charged him to fortify and defend ]
the port of Bayruiti; he built a fortrefs, and it ,
wis here that he got.the surname Geezar, or the
Ravenous, because he had ordered a great number
of people to be buried in the foffe of the fort.
When peace was restored, the Turkilh Admiral,
whohadbeen'-a'JiJaKnted with hitp in Egypt, gave
a very favorable account of his operations at Bay
ruiti, and had him appointed Governor of Acra
and Pacha of Sidon and Tyrus. '
The English General, Cook, has received orders
from the Grand Signior, to leave the territory of
she Ottoman Empire. This order was given in
conference of some violent disputes between the '
Turkish Minister and that General. -1...

Court of King's Bench, June 16.
GAMING. - ;
BADIOLI V. OLDNO.
This was an adtion for money had and received '
for the plaintiff's nfe.
Mr- Gairow stated his client, Mr. Badioli, to 1
be a vety refpedable man, who lud lived many '
years in this town, and had by his indus
try, a handsome fortune.
The defendant kept a gaming-house, at No. 29, 1
Qiendon- BKeti '
He was certain the jury and every body would
â agree with him as to the importance of thisadtion.
The plaintiff had in his hoafe, and'educated under '
his care and protc&ion a gtandfon, not yetairived 1
at age, who, after he had finifhed his education,
was taken into htilinefs by Mr. Badioli, and was '
afterwards to be furmfhed with the means of living '
by his own industry.âThis young man had the '
misfortune to he enticed into qne qf those nume
rous gambling-hoÃfes, which form the pest and de
ftrudiion of the young men of the times in which
wcJive. He there loft a great deal of his grand
facer's money, and of eourfe could not come out
without those arts which undermined every thing
that was valuable in the human mind. He loft at
this house Â£. 161 14, ti>e,fum for which this action
was brought. If he matle out by fair legal evi
dence that that sum of money bad been loft at the
defendant's gaming table, juftiee, common sense,
and law said the plaintiff was entitled to recover it
back again. ThetfTeif of a few verdi&s against
such men, would be extremely beneficial to the pub
lic, inasmuch as it would make the keeping of
gambling houses an unprofitable trade, and there
" tore they woufiJTFiuTtheir tfo'GTJ agalnff 7 yoiing men,
and betake themselves to something better.
The learned couafel hoped the jury, by their
verdifl, would convince fu.:h defendants, at least
that they were not fuperiorto the laws, and make
them feel that the keeping of such houses was a
losing trade!
M. Wilson was here called on the part of the
plaintiff, and said, he was the grandson of Mr.
Badioli, aod lived as servant with him, in the month
of June, 1795. He loft to Mr. Oldno, the de
fendant, the fem of 1611. 14s at No. 29, Oxen
don-ftreet. He loft it playing at Rouge et Noir.
The defendant was there, and, after the game was
over, put the money of the bank, as well as the
money he had won, into a bag. During play,
when any thing was wrong, the defendant dire&ed
the table. There were a great many other people
here. He always law Oldno there. He saw him
there after he had loft his grandfather's money.
On his eiofs examination, he said, his grandfa
ther was an oilman, and he was his servant, and
adled in his shop. He never rendered his grand
father an account, because he kept no till. He
robbtd him of 5001. between the month of June
and the month of September following.âAmong
other things, he discounted two notes, the one for
â¢ 001. and the other for 801. which he took out of
a book belonging to hii grandfather.
Mr. Erflciae was Counsel for the defendant, and
said, he was certain, hii L or dfh'P an d the gentle
men of the jury would join in giving him full credit
for the sincerity of those observations he had made
on that important fubjeft, when engaged for plain
tiffs. then feel any difpofitioni inter
est, or duty to contradict any one of those observa
tions. That the exigence of gaming houses wa's
the pest and definition of the rising generation, of
the young men of this age ; and that they were exl
- dangerous to the community of which we
were all members, he had no inclination to dispute.
But he knew his Lordship too well; and he had no
dOubt that, before the fittings were over, he should
likewise know the jury too well, to suppose their
laudable attempts to prevent the deftruflion of the
community by gambling, would at all alter the or
dinary administration of juftiee, or the rules of evi
dence as applicable to that administration. Be
cause there were gaming houses in this town, which
deserve to be reprobated, did it therefore follow,
that, oti flight evidence, any one fubjeft of the com
munity was to be pitched upon by such a witness
as they had heard, and to have taken out of his i
pocket so large a sum of money, on the single oath
of such a man ? If that witness had been a young 1
man of irreproachable life, conversation aid charac
ter, the cafe would be extremely different. But, '
on his own testimony, he had 110 morality at all,
and had violated every rule of affe&ion, most un-'
doubtedly, which nature had implanted in him.
He took his grandfather's money and applied it (o ;
his own use. He therefore flood in the most suspi
cious He now wished to get back part
of that large sum of money of which he had robbed 1
his grandfather, and a great part of whidTht bad 1
expended on other p'eafures, at brothcis, &c. It
was therefore extremely dangerous to rely on the
evidence of such a man, unfupporKd by any other
testimony.
Two witnesses were called on the part or the
defendant, who gave their evidence in fuelr a man
ner, that
Lord Kenyon told the he thought they i
ought to pay no credit to it. His Lordship was i
certain they would find a great deal of pleasure, as '
far as the administration of juftiie could do it, to i
chcck this growing and monstrous evil.

BURDON V. CARTWRIGHT. (
This was an action for damages agaii)il the de
fendant, for criminal converfatian with the plaintiff s
wife. The declaration Contained also a count for ,
seducing the plaintiff's wife away from her husband,
and harbouring her, &c.
The firft witness proved, that the plaintiff and
his wife lived happily together, and had three chil
dren.
It appeared afterwards in evidence, that the de
fendant had been married to the plaintiff's sister, but
(he was dead.
Some time Â«go the plaintiff's wife quitted her
husband, and went to live with the defendant, 1
palling as the defendant's lifter, who had come
from the country, 300 miles off. Ihe defendant j
invited a gentleman and his lady, Mr. Apd Mrs.
Fletcher, to dine with hirr> ani the plainTTtt's wife,
Whom he called his sisterâWhile they were at din-
ner, the plaint iff came in and addressed his wife,
aflcing where she had been, and wheig her ring was ?
(lie pulled it out of hÂ«r pocket. He invited her to j
return home with him. The defendant said to
her, " Mary, if you have any thing to fay to this |
man, go into another room, and do not dillutb my J
company."
The plaintiff and his wife then went away toge- 1
ther, and she ftais with her husband about a fort
night, but then returned to the defendant ; imme
diately afterwards This action wasTitougfttr mere 1
was no evidence whatever of any Adultejy. f
Mr. Erfkine made a very able and eloquent speech <
for the defendant. He produced a letter which \
the plaintiff wrote to the'defendant after his wife t
went home with him, thanking him for the care he I
had taken of his wife. He then produced anothpr f
letter, and propofsd to read it in evidence ;it was a 1
letter from the plaintiff's wife to the defendant, <
whereby she complained of her hufbandV treat- |
ment towards her ; but Lord Kenyon decided, j
that it could not be read in evidence, for that the <
wife could not, in any manner, be evidence in this i
action. One witness proved, that the wife had, 1
for several year 6, complained of the ill-treatment of i
her husband. I
Lord Kenyon observed to the Jury, that this was 1
a blended action ; that of adultery and feduftionâ
of the adultery there was no evidence, and there
fore they would dismiss that part of the cafe ; but 1
of the feduftion there was abundant proof, and that
was as much an attack on the plaintiff's comfort and 1
peace of mind, as adultery could be. If the wife j
had any rsafon for quitting her husband, she should
have gone to her mother. The defendant had no 1

NAPLES,, May 4.
In spite of the horrible inquifi'ion eflablifhed" by !
the Minister, and the numberlcfs arrests that have
taken place, people still talk here of the disasters of 1
the array of the coalition, and murmur at the ob- 1
ftinacy of the Government. The refufal of the me> 1
diation of Spain, and all the misfortunes of the
State, are attributed to the Queen, who has always
facrificed the interest of Naples to the views of 1
i her family, and the fame remarks are made upon 1
her conduct as those of the people of Paris on her
nnfortunate lifter. Preparations of war are still 1
going on, but the fermentation encreafes. The
troops in Naples far from being fufficient to op- 1
pose the French, will scarcely be able to maintain 1
order and tranquility. Among the persons arrest- 1
ed are almost all the men of letters, and a crowd of
monks and eccleliaftics. The Abbe Vechietti is 1
dead in prison, after having drank a bow! of chdco- :
late, in which it is fufpefted that poison had been 1
infufed. It is not known whether a number of state I
pnfoners of diftinftion and rank, who were perse
cuted are still alive. The numbers arrested in Na. 1
plesand Sicily are eftimatedat 14,000. Ifthe Go
vernment be compelled to enlarge all whom it has 1
prolrcibed, a revolution is inevitable. ,

Different proclamations have appeared within

these proclamations, dated Infpruek, the 21ft of ,
May, begins in the following manner: t
"We mull unite all our efforts to saw; the count
try. It is essentially ne,effary to the maintenance t
of religion, the conftitmion, the property, and e
very thing that is most dear. We have an entire
confidence in the tried courage of the Tyrolefe na
tion, which conjointly with the Imperial troops who v
are this moment entering the county, are in a con- i
dition to check the enemy if they should attempt
an invasion. But to this end provisions and money
are neceflary ; the former cannot be procured with
out a fufSciency of the latter.' 1 t
Hie Proelamation then goes on to recommend t
the instant converting of the church plate into mo- <
ney. Private persons are also invited to fend their f
plate to the mint, and their arms. u j
A second Proclamation was iffiied on the 22d ess
tabliftiisg the ma.nner of transmuting the church and \
private plate, and the nature of the obligations to <
be delivered for them.

s The Venetians were assembled in what is termed

e The young Senators, probably allured by the in

if But the elder and wiser Senators overruled them
is in the debate; and produced a decree, importing,
1- that they would arm only fufficiently to preserve in

A few nights since the Bristol and Birmingham
mail coach arrived at the Hop-pole, in Tewkefku
ry, about twelve o'clock, with four inside passen
gers, confiding of three gentlemen and a lady, when
one of the gentlemen and the lady getting out, left
an old gouty gentleman and another passenger be
hind in the coach. Fresh horses being put to, the
guard and coachman went into the houfeto take a
little refrefhment, when the horses set off full speed,
and passing through the turnpike gate, which was
open, went on for Gloucester, and pafled along the
various turnings with as great legularity as if the
coaehman had been on the box. After going al
most eight miles, to the no small terror of the pas
sengers, they met the other mail coach, the guard
of which, observing that no coachman was on the
box, he went on with the coach towards Bristol.
One of the pafTengers, just before they met the
other mail coach, was so much frightened that he
jumped out, and was much hurt. The old gouty
being unable to follow him was obliged
to flay behind, and was several times heard on the
road, by different persons, crying out murder.

Extract of a letter from a Refpeflable Merchant in J,
London, to a House in this city. r
" I do not regret the treatment of Mr. Jay's j-
Treaty. It was not what it ought to have been,
and might have been, as is generally believed here.
The spirit of the Representatives will be a lefTon to j
future treaty makers. One thing 1 cannot but
express a degree of adonifhment at, and that is the
dread your papers were full ofâof a war in conse
quence of the reje&ion of the treaty. This coun
try has more than enough of war already, and A- ( j
merica will ever'derive morejuftice from firranefs,
than by any expreflions of fear."
â 1. REMARKS.
Nothing can be more ahfurd than to suppose that
the heroes of the American Revolution were afraid
of Great Britain. No, this was not the quelliou
with the statesmen, the patriots of our country. â
War or negociation were the alternative.-âNot
that Great Britain would declare war againd the
United States, but, that, unlels she would consent
to do us.justice, we should unavoidably be compel- f
led to declare war agtiinlt Great Britain. (
The " treatment of Mr. Jay's treaty" has been f
the means of encreafing thfe public expence6 of the t
United States enormouslyâand nowâits oppofers
are trying to persuade the people, that they never
intended to set it aside 1 Let the people beware of I
such -wolves, who are thus arraying themfebes in e
1 sheep's skins. Â£
With refpeft to the above letter, its authenticity J
!. may well be doubted when the compof.tion is taken r
into view. If is however singular that certain per-
sons w\\a feel that (heir opposition to the treaty has '
rendered them odious to the independent and free 4
' citizens of the United States should seek for apo
logists among the English, whom they have been in
the habit of abufirig for two or three years past.

and like the poison tree of Java/would, if not

Liberty.
, J. TO THE PF.OPT.K %
, THE French have broken the fetters which for
so many centuries have weighfed heavy on us ; they
. have put to flight the cowardly satellites of the
, Austrian tyrant, and by the valour of a free peo
t pie we also become free.
The emblems of liberty already wave in thp air.
: This tree which we have just raised in the midd of
1 plaudits and of the transports of joy of an immenle
, coneourfe of people, announces to alt our future re
-5 generation. 1
; Citizens,
; By this feftival, by these emblems, we declare
- that we are free ; but shall we will to be free with
. fufficient energy ? Shall we determine to imitate the
1 generous people that has driven away our tyrants;
; and shall we be animated by the sacred fire of Li
. beity ; shall we prefer death to fubmiflion to a new
; yoke? Yes, Lombards! Let us swear to live free
: or die.
r Let us hasten, Lombards, to accomplish this
1 great work j let us declare unanimously, that we
: will be free; let us (hew ourselves worthy of be
ing free, and we shall be so in reality. Let Reli
. gion and Liberty go hand in hand. Yes! Let
Tyrants tremble at tha sacred name of liberty ;
and far from submitting to new chains, let the vo
racious Eagle return affrighted to his enslaved
, country.

" CITIZENS LOMBAÂ«CS,
Lombarby, ci-devant Austrian Lombardy, after
having experienced duiing so many centuries the
I oppreflive yoke of a number of usurpers, who have
, mauled it even to dedroying the name of its ancient
5 origin, has at last reverted into the hands of its ori
ginal founders ; this country has ceased to be the
patrimony of crime and tyranny. 1
People ,of Lombardy 1 Let us rife j let us turn
with joy and admiration our view towards those
bra/e Frenchmen, the scourge of tyrants,and let us
acknowledge in them our fathers and deliverers. 1
They have not invaded with projects of avarice 1
and ambition. They neither wish to subvert our 1
religion, invade our property, nor endanger ou: 1
fafety ; their efforts are solely againd our natural- 1
enemy, whom we were obliged to call our sovereign, <
he who.had so far debased us as to make us kiss the 1
chain he imposed. !
Let us awake, Citizens Lombards, the tyrant is <
here no more, he has fled. Let us not delay a mo- I
ment the naming 6f a national representation to '
take out of the hands of the mtinicipalities parti- j
fans of oligarchy, the deposit of the Audrian feep
tre. Let us establish a government founded on the t
rights of man, which shall unite all classes into one ;
family ; a government founded upon the principles !
of liberty and equality ; which (hall be the hope
and solace of the poot hitherto oppressed and deba
fed ; let us waufe to be heard at fad, throughout the
crlobt, that the Lombards have resolutely determi
ned to make themfclves a Country.

MR. KENNO,
THE instances of individual heroifnt in the
French armies are worthy of being recorded, and ,
they do honor to the French Nation. There were J
however as striking and extraordinary traits cf he
roism and firtmiefs discovered by the officers and,
soldiers of the American army during our r'evoltlti
on-war, as were ever exhibited on the theatre of
the Globe. An Officer of Artillery told me, that
in one action with the enemy, every one of his ma- i
troffes \yere either killed or woundedâand of
thffe fvho survived, several were wounded in three
and four different parts of the body early in the ac
tion, and yet continued at their poll till it was en
ded. in another adlion a ferjeant of Artillery
continued at his gun, after receiving seven musket
wounds from the shot of the enemy. Yours

TRIBUTE OF GRATITUDE.
ON the 3 111 January, 1796, at half past â¢)
o'clock in rhe evening, the American brig Friend
ship, Capt. Afcough," in a violent gale, stranded on
entering the port of Lisbon. The vefTel soon fill
ed with waterâin this fituawon we remained until
2 o'clock the 1 ext day. The officer commanding
the round Castle, so called, had the goodness to ex
hibit torch lights the whole night. In the morn
ing at fun-rife he alarmed the Bellum Castle and
the city by firing signal guns. The Sea at this '
time wjs so boisterous that n<a one could be prevail
ed on to attempt relieving us. Boats at length
were manned and sent out by public authority, with
orders not to return without effecting our relief,
under pain of deathânotwithstanding this, the
boats after having proceeded, were observed to
turii and rowtowaids fhote,'ou which several can*
non loaded with ball were fired at them. They
then redoubled their exertions, and at length reach
cd the brig and took us outâwe had then been up
to our armpits in water sos mahy hours. We were
carried to Lisbon, destitute of every thing but the
cloaths on our backs, thoroughly drenched. As
soon as we landed we were mod humanely received
by Mr. Jacob Dohrman, merchant of that city*
who placed Us in comfortable lodgings, and the day
following furnifhed us with cloathing. The bene
volent, humane and polite condtift of-the Portu
guese officers, and the friendly attention of Mr.
Dohrixian experiened by, us on this trying and cri J
tical occasion could not be exceeded, and demand
a more grateful acknowledgement than we are abW
