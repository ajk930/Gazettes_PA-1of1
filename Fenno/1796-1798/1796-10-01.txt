or the pradtice of what is called virtue; and ii 1
this (as far as religion is concerned) you relt ail f
ydur hope 6. There is nothing in deism but what c
there is iq christianityâbut there is much in chris- f
tianity which there is riÂ«t in deism. The Chriltian t
has no doubt concerning ajiiture (late every De- t
id, from Plato to Thomas Paine, is on this
overwhelmed with doubts, insuperable by huifc'an t
reason. The Christian has ni misgivings as to the t
pardon of penitent sinners, through the iriterceffion i
of a mediator ; the Deilt is harraffed with appre- a
fceofions, left the moral justice of God (hould de- I
mand, with inexorable rigor, punishment /or tranf- b
grefiion. The Chriltian has no doubt concerning ti
the lawfulnefs and the efficacy of prayer :the'De- h
â¢i!t is diftu-bed on this point by abftradt confideta- b
tions concerningthe goodrfefs of God, which wants Ii
wot to be entreated'; concerning his forelight, 1<
which haS no need of our information ; coÃcerning u
his immutability, which cannot tje changed thro' d
bur lupplitation.' The Chfiftian adwits the provi- g
dence of God and the liberty of humao actions ;
the Deist is involved ia great difficulties, when he
pndertakes the proof of either. r I he Chriltian
has affiance that the spirit of God will help his
infirmities : the Deist does not deny the poffibi'ity

David and Solomom. - g
Mr. Thomas Paine has called the Psalms of Da- f 1
vid, and the Proverbs of Solomon, "ftng books, ami 11
jejl books."
" It is an error, " te call the Psalmsâ '
the Psalms of David-" This error was observed *â¢
by St. jeronfSj many hcmdÂ«<l- before you a
was born. His wordt are "We know that" they 1
are in an errcnf'who ajtribute all the Psalms to Da' 'â¢f
v!d." You, lfuppofe, will rot deny that David
â¢wrote some of tbem. Songs are of variaus forts 1
we have hunting forigs, drinking songs, fighting 1
(orgs, love songs, foolifh, wanton, wicked songs ; 1
if you will have the " Psalms of David to be nothing
but-a colledtion from different song writers," you "
jiyift allow that the writers of them <werc infpiredby
ao ordinary fpr't ; that it is a collection incapable
of being degraded by she name you gave it ; that v
it greatly excelsÂ»every other colledtion in matter and
in manner !â Compare the Book of Psalms with
the Odes of Horace or Anacreonâwith the hymns
of Callimachusâthe golden verses of Pythagoras
âthe Choruffes of the Greek Tragedian, (nocon- I.
"temptible ccmpofitions any of these) and you will 1
qaickly 'fee how greatly it furpafles them all in pi- '
ety of fentimsnt, in lubiimicyof expression, in purity
of morality, and in rational theology !
At you sfttcrn the Psalms of Uavid a Song-Book â¢
it is confident enough in you to esteem the â  Pro
verbs of Solomon a Jest Book : there come down
to us above eight hundred of his jests ;if w e had I
the whole three thousand which he wrote, our mirth
â¢would be extreme ! Let us open the book, and fee Â®
what kind oijefls it contains : take the very firft as
a specimen. " The fear ofthe lord is the begin
ning of knowledge ; but fools defpifc wisdom and in
ftrnÂ£tion.' v Do you perceive anyjeft in this ?The
fear ps the Loidl What Lord Soloman
meai IHe means that Lord who took the pojftrity
fjf Abraham to be his peculiar people who redeemed
s that people from Egyptian bondage, by a miraculous u

the nations of Canaan ! Now this Lord you will

oly " The bombardment comm?nced'at two o'clocjs

of << The alarm depi<3ed on the countenances of the
