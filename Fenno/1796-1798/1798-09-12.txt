FLORENCE, June 1.
The Roman consuls and French com
missaries and generals at Rome, have con
sented to the Pope's remaining in Tufcany ;
but they have desired that his royal high
ness wou'd remove Jiim to some part of the
Grand Duchy more distant from the con
fines of the Roman Republic: in confe
.quence of which, his royal highness invited
his holfnefs to take up his abode at the
.carthutfian convent, distant only two miles
from his metropolis, where his holiness ar
rived yesterday evening in tolerable good
and was received with all the atten
tion and refpeft due to his rank and cha
radter, by his royal highness' special orders,
who Cent offers of every thi.'g that could be
ferviceablc and magnificent s .for his holinefs's
accommodations.
The Pope would have arrived at this con
vent some days sooner, had he not been
obliged to fly to Sienna, and take refuge in
a noblrman's coun'ry house, near this city
in consequence of a dreadful earthquake
which took place there on the 25th ult.
which threw down a considerable part of
the convert in which his holiness resided.
The earthquake has Heen attended with
fatal confequeiictÃ, and has been continued
by repeated (hocks, and trembling of the
earth; and even yesterday the earth was
oceafiona ly perceived to move.
Some lives have been loft, and a great
number of the inhabitants maimed, and
there is not a house in the whole city
which has not fuffered more or less, and
some are actually levelled with the ground.
PHILADELPHIA
The town is entirely def rted. Those
who have not country houses to retire to
have made temporary t'en-ts and coverings in
the adjacent fields, to which they are retir
ed. Even trials is said in a public garden
adjoining to the city. -'
ITALY, JutfE 1.
The Milan Gaiette contains a report,

troops.
At Genoa an infurrediion of the popu

Death to the Patriots." Several

Tranquility is again restored in the vici

of Malta at Rome, has been seized, ar.d

MUNICH, June 5.
TRe Nuncio of the Holy See resident
here, has received we learn the following
intelligence:
" The Fernch general St. Cyr, who com
mands at Rome, wrote some time since to
the Grand Duke of Tufcany,-that as the
troubles which had broken intf Italy>
and principally at Pel ugh, had been occa
sioned by the Pope, he prayed his highness
to take such meafurts as should prevent his
holinvfs from making 33-y longer day within
his territories. The Grand Duke having
declined, it is said, to take any ftcpi in
eonfequence- of this demand, the general
sent him a second letter, the contents of
which resembled a declaration'of war. Soihn
after a detachment of French troops entered
Siena, seized the person of the sovereign
Pontiff, as well as several cardinals an i con
veyed them to Leghorn, where a flotilla was
ready to receive them, which immediately
set fail for Cagliari in Sardinia,
GENOA, June 8.
War between our republic and-the K : ng :
of Sardinia is now nearly declared. It is
kngwn that a (hort time since, about 500 Pi
edmontefe rebels seized the townof Carofio,
which is entirely surrounded by our terri
tory. The king of Sardinia after some fruit,
less application to onr government, for a
passage for his troops, thought proper to
order 4000 men to march thro' the Liguri
an republic and attack the town. The re
bels immediately evacuated Carofio, which
was taken poffefiion of by the Sardinian
troops. Shortly after a battle took place on
tfie Ligurian territory, nearGavi, the com'
mandant of which town fired on the con
tending parties. The flrirmifhing continu
ed two days longer, without any decisive
advantage on either fide. The loss of the
Royal troops in killed and wounded was
much greater than that of the rebels. This
inroad into the territory of the Republic
caused the great council to come to the fol
lowing refoiutions.
ill. That the diredtory (hould take such
meafurts as (hoflld render the Ligurian ter
ritory refpeded.
ad. That all Ligurian citizens (hould re
ceive notice of the present situation of the
Republic with refpedi to the court of Turin.
3d. That 500,000 livres should be as
signed to the dire&ory to enable it to take
such measures as would repel any hostile at
tack of the Piedmontefe troops.
I he frontiers of the Republic have been
in eonfequence occupied by the troops of
the line, volunteers and artillery, and a pro
clamation publi(hed, addressed to the citi
zens" of the Republic. We are very defir
Â«us to know how the French will adt in eon
fequence of this affair.
It is said that 7000 Freflch troops have
already marched to Aleffiiudria and Novi,
to watch the motions of our troops, and
those of Sardinia.
Another letter, fame date.
Yesterday and to-day several corps of
troops marched for the Piedmontefe fron
tiers. Our patriots flatter, tbemfelves that
they will soon return crowned with laurels,
after having dethroned the king of Sardinia ;
though this latter event is certainly much to
be doubted. Some obfeived, that the
French Republic has promised the king of
Sardinia an enlargement of his dominions,
and that he is the ally of France. They
likewise remind us that it was not long since
reported, that the French Republic would
extend its boundaries to Savona, and even
to Genoa. But on the other fide, our di
reftory appears to have a tied in concert
with the agents of France.
It is said that a battle has already taken
place between our tro6p& and those of the
king of Sardinia.

1798-
The inclofijd copies of letters will in

and the loss of his majesty's (hip La Pique.
On both these events I can add nothing
more than to express my fatisfadiion on this

jelly's squadron under my command, con
lifting of the (hips named in the margin-)-,
gave chace to a Frigate of the Saintes, at
eleven at night. The Pique, brou-ht her
to adtinn and continued a running fight, till
the Jason pasTed between the two. At this
inftantthe land near the Point de !a Treuche,
was seen close on our larboured bow, and
before the (hip could aniwer her helm, (he
took the ground close to the enemy, which
we immediately perceived had grounded
also, mod unfortunately, as the"tide rose we
hung only forwards, and therefore fwtwg
with our (tera close to the enemy's broad
side, who, although he was dismasted, did
not fail td take advantage of his happy po
sition; but a well directed fire was kept up
from a fe>.v guns aba f t-, and at half past two
(he ft ruck Our opponent, called La Seine,
was commanded by e capitaine Brej-rt. her
force 42 guns, eighteen and nine pounders,
with cannonades, and 610 men including
troops, she failed from L'lfle de France
three months ago bound to L'Oorent.
IjP the early part of the battle, I had the
mortification to be wounded, and wa9 oblig
ed to leave the deck; but my misfortune is
palliated by the refledlion that the ferviee
did rot fuffer by my absence, for no man
could have filled my place with more credit
te-fcimfclf, and benefit td the State than my
firft lieutenant, Mr. Charles Inglfs; wham
I beg to recommend in the (Ironggft man
ner for his bravery, (kill, and great ex
ertions.
I come now, my lord, to the painful part
ef my narrative, which I am neceffiated to
make more prolix than I otherwise should,
from the peculiar circumstances attending
the engagement; and I firfl mention the
loss. Â»f the Pique, whose officers and crew
deferred a better fate. Captain Milne had
led her to fight in an officer like manner, but
it wai his misfortune that the main top
mad being carried away, he was obliged to
drop a stern. Ardour urged him on to re
new the combat, he did not hear me hail
him to anchor, and the (hip therefore
grounded on cur off fide, near enough to
receive the enemy's fhrtt over 11s, although
very aukwardly fituattd for returning the
fire. In the morning every attempt was <
made to get the (hip off, but the Jason was j
alone fuccefsful I therefore, on si ding '
the Pique was bilged, dire&ed the captain ]
to destroy her, and to exert bis abilities and |
adlivity to save prize; which he with
great difficulty got afloa: yesterday evening,
after throwing her guns, &c. overboard-
The carnage on board La Seine was very
great; 170 men were killed, and about 100
wounded, many of tjiem mortally. I !h
---clofe a lift of the fnfferers on board the Ja
son ; and it is with great concern that among
the killed I place the name of Mr. Anthony
Richard Robot'er, my second Lieutenant,
who died fighting glorioully, and by whole :
fall is loft a mod amiable man and excellent
officer. Lieutenant Riboleau commanded
on the main deck afterwards, and behaved
with great spirit, as did Mr. Lock wood,
the Mailer, and lieutenant Symes of the
Marines ; my other officers of eveiy descrip
tion behaved vastly weil, and the bravery
and excellent copdudt of the crew deserve
much praise.
The Pique was exceedingly (hattered in
her rigging, and tfie Jason has not one mad
or y*rd but 4 what is much damaged, nor a
(hroud nor rope but what is cut, with all
the fails torn to pieces. If our ship cpuld
have remained in hrr fiift position, or our
companion could have occupied the situation
he widied, the bufnicfs mud have been
soOner finifhed, withou so much injury be
ing done aloft. It is but judice to observe
that every effort was made on board the
Mermaid, during our long chace, to ap
proach the enemy, and I feel much indebted
to Captain Newman for having this (hip off,
as that was the only possible means to favc
her. So soon as we were afloat, the squa
dron under Captain Stopford wa6 fcen in the
offing, and being called in by signal, was of
infinite ferviee.
I have the honr;rto"be See.

Member of the Britijh Parlianient) at Ken

land, with a view to rinder me obnoxious
here. Whether they ought to have this
effeft, let any impartial person judge from
tbe -following circumstance*.

England, hut his brother) was a member ol
my congregation at a*d a zea

rev.'lutio s, which fufficiently accounts sot
bis corresponding with me. B"t lam not
anfwerahle for what he, or any other perfoa,
may think proper to write.to me.
The letter inclosed to me is for Mr.
Benjamin Vaughan, formerly a pupil ol
' mine, and son to Mr. Samuel V*nghan,
who fiimetirfic 'tfgo.refiried in Philadelphia,
He, like rr.e, thought it neceflary to have
England, and si r si.m time is said to have

OUR. address of the id inft. was' in- j
tended t"> present to your view the deplora
ble date of our city, and to excite into ac
tive exertion the philai threpy and benevo
lence so eminently charafteriftic of the citi
zens of Pernfylvanta. The fame generous
sentiments which you have difplaytd has in
fluenced the worthy and benevolent citizens
of Bait more ; who always alive ta the feel
ings of hurnanity, have, it app ars by the
public papers, agreed to a fubfeription for
the relief of our distressed fellow citizeni.
We return them all the gratituue and ref
peft to which difpofttions so amiable are
entitled but it becomes our duty public
ly to state that a fund has been provided for
the purpose, upon the principal of a loan
in anticipation of the liberality ana justice
of our Legislature, which precludes the
necefEty of donations is money from the
humane citizens of our 'filter ftatcs.âCon
tributions of provisions fro ti our fellow-ci
tizens in the country, as well in New Jersey
as in our own State, have been forwarded
for the use of the distressed. with a liberali
ty which dopsbpnorto tiie donors.
We flatter that fimibsr donations
v.'tjl be continued by those generous indivi
duals, who are contiguous to the city, and
with convenience spare a part of their
produce for the relief of fufFer'ng humanity,.
By order of the Board of Managers.
