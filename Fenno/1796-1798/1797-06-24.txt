1 HOUSE or REPBTESENTATIVES,
r May 31.
Delate oh Adorefs-, reported, in anfister to the
Pre/idcnt's Speech.
Mr. Dayton, (the Speaker) CaiJ that
the tedious length of debate and unprofitable
' waste of time which the ftrft amendment oc
casioned, had determined him to submit his
t proposition to the Committee and without
troubling them with any comments to leave
- it to it's fate. The criticism which it had
1 provoked from the gentleman from South
Carolina would have juftifted him in depart
ing from that determination, even if there
had been no other inducement, but as sever
al gentlemen had defired'a modification of
, his motion, he rose more Immediately gra-
J tify.them, as he found he could do it with
-1 ; out affefting the principle. / _
. I . Mr. Dayton here particularly pointed
' out the alteration which he consented to
j make in his amendment; -which being ac
, cordingly made and read by the Chairman,
Mr. Dayton said that he trufled that all
u parts of the house were imprefled with the
"' importance of their being unifetT at la time
t . and upon an occasion so critical, when the
e eyes of a corifiderable part of Lurope were
3 turned upon them, and when they had been
y informed that their AddrefTes to the Prefi
" 1 dent, far from pafling unnoticed, had pro
bably already influenced the conduftof some
- of the European powers towards the United
t States.
3 With this information before them,' he ho
-1 ped that gentlemen would not obstinately
I persist in maintaining their ground without
it yielding in the least to each other, and in
a refilling all advances towards accommodati-
; f on, especially when it appeared that their
, difference was confined to words, or at mofl,
â to forms, and that in substance they were
J almost all agreed. From all parts of the
- committee a difppfition had been avowed to
~ place France on grounds as favourable as o
" i ther countries, and not awithhad been uttered
|]! to the contrary even by t!ie member from S.
! Carolina until yesterday. Believing himfelf
J that the United States were thus favorably
d disposed towards that Republic, and very
lt much preferred an honorableaccommodation
, to an unprofitable warfare with them, he had
1- thought it his duty to offer an amendment |
:r avowing such principles. He had before .
said and now repeated, that he was desirous
of maintaining peace, so long as it could
i. be effefted without the loss of independence,
or national dishonor. He trusted that he
should hot be charged with a want of zeal
in the cause, ifhe did not particularly an
swer the arguments and follow the footfteps
of those gentlemen who had taken it npon
themselves to arraign France like a culprit
. it their Bar, and to compel the committee
,y to fit; as it were, in judgment upon the
1- condutft, the motives and the designs of that
Â» Republic,.not in relation to the United
States whofe'interefts alone were confided to
t. the care of their Rcprefentatives, but in ref
> psft to the nations of Europe," who - had
'd 1)f-n leagued for her deftruÂ£tion, and witll
" whose internal regulations and political con
\ rtexir.ris that Itoufe-had nothing to do. If
18 truth had permitted, decency, Mr. D, said,
I' fhouldhave forbidden the members to address
iy the nations of Europe, &to fay to one nation,
you are enjlaved ; to another, you are oppref
'> fed, and to a third, you are deceived, and
your monarch held in leading firings by the
I- French Repvifclic under the femb lance of
c > Friendship. Policy and decorum should e
'e qually have restrained gentlemen from such
if reflections at a time when Representatives
II from those very nations were received and
accredited as the Ministers of Nations, fov
Â£ ereign and independent as ourselves, and per
mitted not only to re'fide in our Metropolis, !
J r but to fit within their walls and listen to their
debates. If they were discussing the means
j) of maintaining the balance of Europe, and
ie were deliberating into* which scale theUni
e" ted States would throw themselves as make
10 weights, then indeed such obfervatious might
d, be more pertinent and juftifiable, but as the
le question really was, by what means the peace
of this country'jhould be honorably preferred,
,g he could not fee the propriety Of such rea
nt foiling. Mr. Dayton hoped he should not
be accufod of want of spirit, if he did not
assume the high tone of menace which some
0. gentlemen had done, if he did not talk of
!y war, as a mere matter of paflime, or of con
or quering whole provinces, as if they had only
to walk over and make them their own, or
-d of buckling on the armour of hostility, and
'y of dying in the lajl ditch. He had conceived
cc that this country might exhibit becoming
y firmnefs, w-itho'ut rushing into intemperance
of and that they might shew a proper spirit of
llc resentment without exhibiting the rage of a
' e Â° madman. Fortunately for them, it was not
; es necessary that they should crouch as fuppli
ta- ants at the feet-of a mailer and hold out a
carte blanche, to have" inferibed on it the
terms of their fubmiflion and peace, nor' on
the other hand to assume the poftu're of Gla
diators and found the trumpet of defiance.
He neverrhelefs felt the full fotce of thein
th dignity which had been offered us in the re
e(j Jecrion of our miniiler, and he owiied that
rB he could not calmly hear the French Re
-e public addrefling the United States in terms
a l the mofl imperious and fayirig' " this law
1 a you mull thrfe decisions you mull
refcind, those engagements you mufl-annul
jjj before we can have further communion or
a _ intcrcourfe with you." Such language was
unwarrantable and iufulting. But a desire,
still if possible to conciliate, rather than to
make war,-and afenfeof gratitude, not yet
extinguished in his bread, induced him to
moderate htÂ£ indignation, although it did
not prevent his refilling such improper at
tempts to interfere in the Government.â
l '' The recolltfftion of what France had been
to us, in times the most critical, would in
cline him still to address her and to (ay,â
"You Frenchmen were our JirJl, yon have
been our bejl Ally. You alone came for
wards to our alÃflance, at a time when that
country wlio called herfelf our motlier, .and ;
whom we had been pioud to acknowledge
as fuchj) not only threw us from her protec
tion bt>t endeavoured to reduce Us to uncon
ditional fubmiffipn. When every other na
tion fled from our alliance, and all other peo
ple avoided any intCrcourfe, treatihg us ra
ther as rebels than as men struggling for Our
just rights, then you, people of France, or
(jf gentlemen prefer it) your monarch,- â
strong in your flrength, rich in your wealth,
supported by your will, nobly held out a
helping hand for our protection, and ac
knowledged and granted our Indepfndeace.
Then wasfigned that compact which uni
ted your fate and interests with ours. But
if owing to change of circtimftances, that
treaty operates now to your injury, we will
no longer hold yon to its observance. That
which you generously gry.ted in 1778 as a
pledge of friendfhip, we as liberally restore
to you in 1797, when it is your opinion
unequal, and has become a source of dif-"
quet to you. We agree that it should be
cancelled. Our laws made for the preserva
tion of our neutrality and peace we. cannot
repeal, the deciiions of our courts we cannot
rescind, oUr engagements with foreign pow
ers we cannot violate, but vve freely consent
to cancel that compaft fublifting between
us, which prevents your participating in the
favors granted to Great-Britain in the treaty
of 1794. This obflacle removed,'the three
articles of Mr. Jay's treaty, viz. that of neu
tral ships not protecting enemy's property,
that regulating what ftiall be contraband,
and the provision article can be extended to
you."âThis, Mr. Dayton said, was the
lapguage which he conceived to be most pro
per and dignified on the present occafiori.
He, however, refilled the conftru&ion which
had been put Upon the second article of the
treaty of 1778, and had been the pretext
for passing the decree of the 2d of March,
and by no means admitted that France
could- claim, those favors as a right. Altho'
he could never consent to repeal the aft of
Congress of 1794, nor to violate in the le'aft
our engagements and treaties with other na
â¢ f _â¢
tions at the requisition of France, or any'
foreign power, becanfc the independence,
the honor and good faith of the U. States
forbade it ; yet he should rejoice to learn
that our government would think proper to
offer at the very commencement of the ne
gociation to annul the French treaty, in
! which their miniiter fays they find only dif
; advantages. This he believed would be
found to he the truefl policy also in refpeft
to all other nations whose treaties with us
' should, from change of circumstances, cease
to be equal and reciprocal. They would
otherwise be the sources of hostility rather
than of friendship and good neighbourhood.
The amendment which he offered to the
committee of the whole had expressed a hope
to that effeft, that the d'ifpofition" ( which
was not. questioned) in our government to
' place France on grounds as favorable
other gountrifs, joined to. a mutual spirit of
conciliation, vould prbdnce an accommoda
tion compatible with.otir engagements, rights,
honor and intCreib. If he had believed that
such a difpofitioo (lid not exist in this coun
try, or that the e*prefiion of a hope that it
would elfeÂ£t an accommodation, could ,be
fairly tonftrued into an improper interfer
ence with this executive authority, he should
have been among the last" to advocate a mo
tion of such tendency, but\as on the contrary
it contained in it nothing dictatorial or im
perative, and as the speech of the President
invited them to give an opinion relatively to
the contemplated' negociation, he was per
suaded that it was not liable to any conftitu-
I tional objeCtitm, and that it might have a
conciliatory effeCt". After making these
general remarks, Mr. Dayton said it might
be proper to take some notice of the objec
tions of the gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr.
Smith) which were at confli& with each
other. He said " France -would be offended
at the propofalif that were true, then
agreeable to the doCtrine of his colleague
(Mr. Harper) it w;ould inspire them with
respect, for us: but he added also that
France would ;" laugh at the propofalthis
was indicative of contempt, and Mr. D. did
not fee how they could look upon it with
such opposite sensations at the fame time.
The fame gentleman went on to fay that
to place France on grounds as favorable as
other countries would be to put her on a
worse footing than she then flood, and yet
in almost the a?xt breath he declared, that
the reprefentaftves would betray the interdls
of their conflituents if thsy did not demand.
from that republic' some compensation in re
turn for granting them such favors. These
were inconfiftfcncies which the gentleman
mufl reconcile' hefore. he could be entitled
to a more particular answer. Mr. Dayton
then took notice of what had been urged
againfl his arnendment, as improperly dicta
ting to the Executive, and as a violation of
the conflitutiqn, and fliewed that it was nei
ther the one nor the other. He concluded
with faying that .such a sentiment mijAt
have an influence in preparing the way for
the favorabk reception of their negociators,
and prove the,harbinger of peace between
the two countries.
THURSDAY, JTfNE tl
f Concluded fropi jeJltrdafi Gazette )
Mr, Otis /lid not think that the objeft
of the mover of thisamendment would be ob
' tained by it, fjnee he believed vessels woufd
be as'much exjjofed todanger within aswith
out the jurifdiftion of the United States.
Hetrufled they should leave this business'
to the President ; for whatever personal ob
jections gentlemen might have to him (be
cause he was not the man of their choice) he
believed the people at large would be willing
he should have this power. Indeed he tho't
whatever it might display of candour in gen
tleman to fay they had no confidence in the
firfl officer of Government, it had very little
of discretion in it. It was to deflroy one of
the objefts of the fefiion, which was to (lie w
to the world that we were not a divided
p.op!e.
Mr. O. did hot fay that Congref* had not
a right to defiijnate the ot>je& of tins iorce ,
but he believed it would not be convenient ;
for, said he, suppose either of the Barbary
States were to declare war against us (and
they all knew there was no certain reliance
upon their observance of treaties) fhouid
not the President have a right to fend those
vessels into the Mediterranean ? Or suppose
we wanted to fend an AnibaUador to a for
eign country, or dispatches to our Minitler
reliding there, shall we, said he, limit his
power in this respeCt ?
He denied that the House had expressed
art opinion favorable to a limitation of the
employment df the frigates, by theit decisi
on upon the fubjeft of the gallies : The
equipment of the gallies was an extraordi
nary measure, intended for temporary exi
gencies.,-and as it was a new force placed in
the hands of the Executive, it might be
propel* to avow its deflinatiot), and thus
avoid the appearance of hoflile intentions,
But the frigates were'-an ordinary peace es
tablishment, provided long before our oon
troverfies with the French ; a law had pas
sed the lafl feftion for completingtheir equip
ment, in which no mention was made of t!Â»;
mode of employing them ; I n making pro
vision for manning and fending them to sea,
we exercised a right in the regular course of
legiflatioh, for which-we were not accounta
ble ; and if the amendment prevailed, he
thought three wooden towers would be
quite as ufeful as confidence.
It seemed to be the objeft of gentlemen,
Mr. O. said, to hang a dead weight upon
every measure, to prevent any thing effec
tual from being done, that an idea might go
abroad that the President had ealled them
together unnecessarily. If gentlemen could
succeed in this, .the people might adopt
their opinion, and believfe the President was
unworthy of their good opinion.
He thought when all the world was in
arms, and we did not know how soon we
might involved in the calamity, it behov
ed us to be upon our guard, and to give the
President such powers, as should enable him
to take proper measures of defence againfl
any attack that might be made upon us.
Mr. Macon thought every thing which
had been introduced about confidence, or
the want of it, in the President, was ex
tremely irrevelant and improper. For gen
tlemen to charge others with a want of con
fidence in the President, because they hap
pened to disagree in opinion, was extraordi
nary conduft. His reason for proposing the
present amendment, was to prevent these
vessels from being sent to the Mediterranean
or the Weft Indie*. He read an extraft
from the law in 1794, to shew that the ob
jeft of the frigates was there designated to
be against the Algerines. Hi 6 objeft wa3
now that they should be employed on the
coast, and no where else. If a provHien
of this kind was not agreed to, they knew,
from his speech, upon what business the
President would employ them. He had gi
ven his opinion to the House with candour,
and he wished the House to be equally ex
plicit.
Nr. GAttATiu observed it seemed to be
the opinion of the gentleman from Massa
chusetts, tbdt if they defined the objeft up
on which these vessels were to be employed,
they should be chargeable with difrefpeft to
the President. We have, or we have not
a right, said Mr. G. to define the objeft.â
if we have not the right, we ought not to
exercise it ; but if we have the right, there
could be no difrefpeft fhe>yn to the Ptefi
derit by an exercise of *hat right. It might,
be improper, but could not be difrefpeftful.
If once such an argument as this were ad
mitted, it would be introduced on every oc
cafiori vyhen it would have weight. Indeed
the gentleman saw that such an assertion was
likely to have its weight on this queflton,
and therefore introduced it. He wished to
know whether the clause from the Senate
' did not define the .objeft ; and if so, whe
ther that body could be charged with want
ing refpeft for the President i
objeft of the frigates had never
been defined, for a good reason ; because
they were never ordered to be manned till
now. The gentleman from S. Carolina had
said they were not to be used for any hoi
tile purposes whatever. He wished to know
how they were then to be employed ? He
thought they would be somewhat expensive
packet beats to carry dispatches abroad. He
knew only of two purposes for which they
could be used, viz. to be held in readiness
in cafe of war, and in the mean time to be
employed in some purpose, or other, which
he thought should be defined, and not left in
doubt. He therefore hoped the amendment
would be agreed to.
Mr. Dana said, admitting that they had
a rjght to define the objeft of this arma
ment, it was no reason why they should irt
fift upon exercising it. He agreed that
" they had the right. He had no ob
. jeftion to leaving.the.business to the Presi
dent, except that, if the vessels were em
ployed in convoying our commerce, he
â  should have wished to have shared the res
ponsibility With him. He denied.that the
, danger which had been predicted could arise
from the disputed. articles in thc_ French
treaty, as the President had a riglit to give
such inftru'Ctions to the commanders on that
fubjeft, as he saw proper.
Mr. W. Smith thought the propofitipn
â  vague, fincp it did- not fay the vessels should
1 -not be ufe'd in any other way. Gentlemen
- were begging the question, when they said,
â¢ that if the business were left with the Pre
> (Ident, the consequenCe would be thai the
â  vessels would be employed as a convoy , iinee
he did not believe they were equal to that
' objeft. It was liis wifli that the hands of
; the Prefideiit should not be tied, and tho't
: it extremely imprudent at the present time
â¢ to discover a want of confidence in the Ex
' ccutivei
Mr. Kitter A had often seen that House
attempt to take powers which did not be
' long to it. He thought this one of those
I cases. had power to raise an army
navy, but the use of them lay frith the
t President.'
Mr. S. Smith said they had beencalled
together, beeaufe the French had commit
ted depredations on our commerce, and re
fufed to-receive our Minifler. He took no
tice of the different aÂ£ls which they had
pafl"ed this session, till, he came to this,â
which, .in his opinion, if our veflels went
out to lea, woUkd iead to war, and therefore
he wiHied to Invs them limited- .

had been rcjefled in the Senate, by a ma
jority of three votes.
Frid-ay, June 23.
A message from the Senate informed the
House, that they had passed a bill making a
detachment of the militia of the United
States ; and also a bill preventing the regis
tering of-.veffels taken by any foreign
and afterwards purchased into the United
States, except to the original owner, with
amendments. The amendments were taken
up and agreed to.
1 The House again went into a committee
of the whole, on the bill providing for the
prote&ion of the trjtdeof the United State,
when
" Mr. V"EN able renewed his motion to al
ter the lixth. feÂ£tion of the bill, so as to fix
the wages to be allowed to the petty officers,
midlhipmen, seamen, ordinary seamen, and
marines, instead of leaving it to the Presi
dent to fix them, on the ground of its be
ing legislative and not executive business.
This motion was opposed, from the cir
cumstances of wages being so fluftuating as
to make it impoiTible to fay now what would
be a proper rate of wages to be 'given when
the veflels were ready to receive <their men ;
and as the fufn was not to exceed fif
teen thousand dollars per month, rio mif
chief could arise from leaving the business
with the executive. -Â»*
Thfi question was put and negatived,. 48
t0 37* , '
' Mr. P-ARK-Eii moved to add two new fec
tipns to the bill ; the firft was " to autho
rize. the President of the United if
be deem it necessary, to enoreafe the strength
of the revenue cutters, fp as that the num
ber of men do not exceed to each in
order to defend4he sea-coast, and to repel
any hostile veflels, and to ptoteS the com
merce of the United States within the ju
rifdiftion thereof, having due regard to their
duty in the protettioiyjf the revenue."
The second feci ion provided, " That the
â¢additional compensation allowed to the men
employed in the revenue cutters, by an Aft
of May 6, 1796, should be extended to the
additional men proposed to be employed."
Mr. Nicholas wilhed, instead of the
words " if he deem it neceflary," in the
firft clause, to introduce those used 011 a for
mer occasion, when the gallies were under
consideration, aiz. " if c'ircurr.jlances Jhfill
hereafter arise, which, in his opinion, Jhall
render it expedient."
Mr. W. Smith saw, no difference be
twixt the two phrases, except that the one
prOposed was not so well expressed as the
priginal. He wilhed the gentleman to fay
in what the difference confilted.
Mr. Nicholas said, that by the words aÂ»
they now flood, they referred to the Presi
dent what it was their duty to determine for
themselves. He wilhed to have an eye to
any future occasion which might arise ; but
if the clause passed as it now appeared, the
President might immediately go into the bu
siness:
Mr. Parker consented to adopt the
words of Mr. Nicholas.
Mr. S. Smith and Mr. Parker intro
duced two or three fmafl amendments,which
related to the number of lieutenants, fer
jeants, corporals, Â£cc. to be employed, which
were agreed to.
The bill having been gone through,
ftft. R. Williams proposed ta amend
the firft feftion of the bill, "by adding, after
empoweringthe President, ftiould he deem
it expedient, to cause tee frigates to be man
ned and employed, " provided they Jhall not
be empioyed as convoys."
Mr. Giles hoped this amendment would
be agreed to. He wilhed to define the ob
ject for which these veflels Ihould be employ
ed, that there might be n.o mifundprftmiding
on the fubjeit. ' Mr. G: infilled tliat the
French nation had a rig'it to enq *ire of our
tommiffioncrs for 'what we were arming ?
And if this amendment Were agreed to, it
would be a fufficient answer.
Mr. W. Smith fiid, if
were agreed to it mjcht go farther than it
was meant to go. frigates might not
be able to protest the trade of the. United
States Â«t {ill. He did not suppose they
would be employed in convoying our veflels
to the Weft-Indjes, ; but if this provision
passed, it would not be pofljble for them to*
protest our trade from the cape aof tha De
laware to the capes of Virginia.
Mr. S. differed in opinion from the gen
tleman lad up that the French nation had a
right to take umbrage at our arming. Whentvri nations were al peace, atvl one o; them i'
began to arm ( it wa> customary to tnquire'; ]
what was tlic objeft of it.; but when two , i
nations had disputes tq fettle,, and one of 1
ihi nations had committed v aggreffioris a- 1
gainst the other, it was'common for the in- i
j used nation to drm in her defence ; and, if I
the Frefich najtion refafed to treat with out' 1
commissioners, until they arifwered enqui- i
rie3 refpefting our arming, he believed they
were determined upon war. ,
Mr. S. Smith said, if he tinderftood the
amendment to go to the length which the
gentleman from S. Carolina represented it to
.go, he ihou'd Certainly be oppofefl to it ;
but he believed'it only Went to prevent the
frigates from being employed as convoys to
foreign ports. Merchants, he said, who â '
eaft-ied on a fair course of trade, would not .
â¢&fk for tanvoys 5 they would wish to run the â 
risk and go aloneâfor if they Went under j
Convoy the probability would be, that from â 
a n>Â«nbcr of vessels failing together, they
â would glut arty market to which they might
go, and consequently lower the price of their
cargoes ; "but merchants who wished to go
Snto tefeel ports would wish to be convoyed,
md the firtl convoy that wertr on such a
business, be was confident, vyould produce
war.
Mr. S. jnftified the expression he made use
of yesterday, with refpeft to the French,
making enquiry into the cause of our arma
ment. Not that they could take any notice
of our fortificatiems, or our militia regula
tions 5 but when we are about to fit out a
naval armament, it was a different thing,
and the maritime powers of the world had a
right to enquire the cause of our arming.
Our commifiioners, when they were asked,
would fay they knew not. The French
would answer, " Enquire, if it be against
us, we (hall know what to do ; if not, let us
know."- To avoid this enquiry, he wished
to designate the objeft.
Mr. Venable said, from what fell from
the gentleman from S. Carolina, he supposed
he would be fatisfied with a small amend
ment. That gentleman supposed that the
present amendment would prevent the fri
gates from convoying our merchant vessels
from one part of the union to another. This
might be remedied, by adding, " to any fo
reign port or place"
Mr. R. Williams consented to make
this a part of his amendment.
Mr. Brookes wished to know whether
the frigates were to be prevented from tak
ing any vessels bound to a foreign port un
der convoy at all, though she might be go
ing out at the fame time with vessels; bound
to different parts of the union.
Mr. Potter hoped this amendment
would, obtain, as he did not believe these
vessels would be equal to the convoying of
onr commerce. He hoped, before,the ses
sion clbfed, they should pass an aft for arm
ing our merchantmen, which, he believed,
would be the best proteftioa that could be
given to our commerce.
The queflion was put and carried 47 to
Mr. CpiT moved an additional feftion,
** to confine the duration of this aft , for one
year, and from thence to the end of the next
session of Congress, and no longer."
Mr. Sitgreaves thought that the period
for which the seamen and marines were en
gaged, being only for one year, there needed
no other humiliation.
Mr. Coit was of a different opinion. It
was true the men could riot be engaged for
' a longer period than a year, but those en
gagements might i>e renewed from time to
time, tor his part he did not wish to fee a
permanent naval eftablifiiment in this coun
try ; he would rather fee the frigates at the
wharves than fee them go to sea. He trust
ed a majority of the House would one day
be of his opinion , and, if such a change of
sentiment should take place, he wished to
put it in their power to annul the establish
ment.
The question on this feftion was put, and
there appeared to be 46 votes for it, and 45
votes against ; when the chairman (Mr.
Dent) according to the power given him
by the rules of the House, declared the
question not carried.
The committee rose, and the house pro
ceeded to consider the amendments ; the firft
which came under consideration, was that
for confining the frigates from being used
as convoys.
Mr. Sitgreaves hoped this amendment
would not prevail. He was at a loss to ac
count for the change of sentiment *1 the
House sinCe yesterday ; he thought it was
then the opinion that they ought to provide
the force, and when provided, leave it to the
disposal of the Executive, and that if he
thought proper to employ the frigates in
the protection of our commtrce beyond the
jurifdiftion line, he should be authorized to
do so. He yet entertained this opinion.
It Was a little extraordinary, be said, that
those gentlemen who had, on a former Joc
cafion, quoted the articles of the armed
iteutrallty, should forget one of the moll
important, he meant that which fanftioned
tht right of convoying their trade in time of
peace, to protest tbeir ueutrality against the
aggressions of belligerent powers, which
doftrin'e had, by a solemn aft of her gov
ernment been aequiefced in by France.â
This being k the cafe, and feeing that the
President of the United States, in his speech
at the opening of the session, had declared
his opinion, tjiat vessels ought to be provi
ded as a convoy to our commerce, and
knowing no principle in the law of nations
to the contrary, he was surprised the right
should be called in question. He hoped no
aft of that House would juftify such a sen
timent.
Another glaring inconsistency. Gentle
men admitted that the frigates were to be
employed for the proteftion and defence of
our commerce ; but he asked how' this
aould be effefted, if they were not to be
employed in the way of convoys ? He dia
ftot mean for a number of ships together,
but for fmgle vessels. But it was said that
citizens who carried on an hon'ell trade, â
â¢Would Aot afira convoy. How did this a*i
pesr ? H?d no attack. be;n made upon the
fair commerce of this country ? If there
had been none such, he would allow that
there Was no necessity for a convoy or naval
force ; but, if therf had been aggressions,
they must hafre been upbfl the fair trade of
this country, and persons emp'.Tysd in this
trade, were entitlea to proteftion.
Why, he asked, were they always told <jf
our commerce-being forced into the rebel
pori's in the Weft Indies, and that war
would be the consequence ? Were it to be
supposed that the President would Wantonly
go into this business ? hoped they
should do what the circumstances of the
country required, and not profufely lavish
money which could ar.fwer no good purpose,
since -the injuries committed within ourju
risdiftion compared to those sustained upon
the high seas, were not worthy .of being
named. If any proteftion was given there
fore, it should be extended beyond the jurif
diftion line.
But it vvas said three frigates were incom
petent to the proteftion of the trade of the
United States [ but they might be compe
tent to protest a part of it; and if three
frigates were not effeftual, Was the duty
of that House to provide such as would be
effeftual. But if this force -would not be
able to meet the naval power of any Euro
pean country, it would be able to keep off
privateers and picaroons, and therefore be
of some service.
Mr. M' Dowell said, that if the gentle
man last up had beed present when the fub
jeft had before been under discussion, he
would have spared his observations, as the
principle 01 a convoy had been decided a
gainftby a large -majority. Mr. M'D. went
over the arguments which had been several
times repeated against the employing of con
voys, and concluded with hoping the mo
j tion would pass.
Mr. Sitgreaves acknowledged he was
absent when the fubjeft of the gallies was
under discussion ; but he had been told that
principle had not been decided ; but, sup
pose it had, his opinion was not to be influ
enced by a majority of that House, if he
were convinced it was well founded.
Mr.Giles said, heretofore gentlemen had
given up the idea of employing these vessels
as a convoy, from their incompetency to
that objeft'; but now, the gentleman last up
came forward, and said if they were not
used for that purpose, they would be of no
service at all. He allowed with the gentle
man that we had a right thus to employ
them, but he denied that it was.expedient
to do so. The President had committed
himfelf on this, head, and he thought they
ougflt to give him an opportunity of re
trafting his opinion, by fixing the objeft to
which the vessels should be employed.
Mr. Swanwick said, he felt himfelf call
ed upon to give his reasons for voting against
employing these frigates as a convoy to our
trade. HeJooked upon the force as wholly
inadequate. But it was said it might be
brought t6 operate in part. He was, how
ever, afraid, that in attempting an objeft to
which they were not equal, they might, in
the Weft-India seas, endanger the loss of the
vessels themselves ; for, when the privateers
a nd cruisers in those seas, learnt that we had
frigates out, they would become more acri
monious than ever.
Mr. S. said, it could not be supposed that
the present war in Europe would be of long
duration, nor could it be expefted that we
should be competent, whilst ~it lasted, to
give complete proteftion to our commerce ;
he thought, therefore, it would be much
better to trust entirely to insurance, than to
risk these vessels as a convoy. And if the
trade was not worth carrying on, after hav
ing paid the insurance, he would give it up.
He wished to avoid any measure which might I
lead to war; for if that were to take place,
we should fuffer infinitely more than we now
fuffered from any depredations committed
on our commerce. Our trade in the Weft-
Indies, he said, was in some degree protect
ed by the rival interests of the contending
powers in those seas. They had heard (&
he owned that it was with no pleasant sen
sation he heard it) that our vessels had fail
ed under British convoys in that quarter, so
that the trade, in some degree, protested
itfelf, by the interest which it holds out to
the parties. If the frigates were to' be em
ployed as convoys, he did not believe the
ratesofinfurancewouldat all be lowered ; for
hedidnot find .that even the Britifh,with all
the force they had in the Weft-Indies, could
effeftually protest their merchant vessels
against the French privateers. Besides, he
should look upon the loss of one of the fri
gates as a very unfortunate occurrence ; it
would cast a damp opon the germ.of our ni
vy, and would be a discouragement, to the
voting of any more money for that objeft.
This he should most sensibly regret. The
frigates might be of some use in the protec
tion of our coasts and jurifdiftion, without
running any of the risks which he thought
would be run in fending them out as convoys
Coming from a'large commercial city, as
he did, he should never be backward in his
support cf an effeftual riaval establishment;
but for the present, he thought it best to
keep the frigates about our coast.
Mr. W. Smith agreed with the gentle
man from Rhode Island, that the arming of
our merchant vessels would be a good defence
for our commerce; but he thought there
would be little chance of fucha measure pass
mg ; he fuggeÃed to lhat gentleman, there
fore, whether it would not be better to cleave
to thii.âAs to the amendment, he was
doubtful of its meaning. Did it mean the
frigates might be employed to convoy vessels
houtid to a foreign port, bnt not within a
certain diflanceof those port?; or did it mean
that they should not go further lhan thres
miles from the sea coatt. He thought it very
doubtful, and calculated to coabarrafi the
executive in his pro*, ceding*.

the duty of a republic to correel those errors, or

As to Louifianaâln the firft plaee, the French

The foregoing is a more explicit avowal of enmi
ty to the' peace, liberty, fafety and independence of
the United StatesÂ» than any thing that the pen of
a nefarious.fa<Jlion has yet produced. The reader
will observe that not the smallest benefit is propos
ed to result to the people of the United Sta e& from
the plan, except that the British will not have it in
their.power to let loose the Indians upon us.
A late writer in a Conne&icut paper afTerted
that the Indians, previous to the peace of 1763, had
been at war with tht people on the Frontiers for
o;Â»e hundred yearsâand to ascertain the difference
between French andEnghfh influence on the minds
of the Indians, consult the newspapers of the late
Dr. Franklin.
It needs not the spirit of prophecy to determine,
that fhouid the wishes of the fadlion be realized,
peace will be a stranger to our frontiers so long as
an Indian exifls to wield the tomahawk.

Lajl Evening arrived here his Majrjly's

6th of Mayj and have extracted from them the
very interefling intelligence of the Peace concluded
between the Emperor ahdthe French Republic.
Mr. Hammond had arrived at Vienna, and
theJlrvigefl expeSations were entertained that a
general Peace would immediately take place.
The embargo flill continued injhe ports of
France. The mo/I perfeS order'wai reflored
in the fleet at Sp'itheadâthe firfi division of
which under Sir Alan Gardner had dropt
down, the other divisions were preparing to fol
low, and the whole fleet was immediately to pro
ceed to sea. The men, gratful to government
for the indulgence Jhewn them, go to sea with
inyeafed enthusiasm to meet the enemits of their
Country.
The following are the mofl interefling Arti
cles which are continued in the London papers.
LONDON, May 6.
Mr. Baflet, one of the King's MefTen
gers, arrived at Lord Grenville's Office yes
terday with dispatches from Sir Movvon E
den, his Majefly's AmbafTador at the Court
of Vienna, dated the J2d ult* They con
tain an ample confirmation of the important
inteib'gence announced to the public in our
last paper. The preliminaries of peace bet
ween hie Imperial Majesty and the French
Republ'c, were Igned on the ;3th instant, J
betiveen his Royal -Higfinyfs the Afchduko )
Charles and Gen. Buonapartet
We believe we may state, with some de
cree of confidence, that the bafis> on which
the Preliminary articles of peace was agreed
to, wasâthat the Emperor confenteEto cede
to the French Republic the Low countries,
the country of Nice, Savoy, and Avignon.
The other complicated ot the general
arrangement for the peace of Germany, and .
we hope, of Europe, are to be fettled at a
Congress to be held at Bade, to which his
Britannic M-ijefty has the option of fending
an ambassador, if he pleases. Mr. Ham
mond will, therefore, arrive at Vienna very
opportunely to repair thither, as he is char
ged with full powers to treat for this coun
try. Mr. Hammond was met at D.refden
on the 25th ult. on his journey to Vienna.
We cannot but regard the nature of thdfe
Preliminaries as favorable to Great-Britain,
underallthe circumstances ofthe cafe.âThe
French by admitting of a Congress have a
feandoned that filly and vain ftipulatioA of
treating for peace only , at Paris, to which
all the powers of Europe who wished to sue
for it, were to fend their plenipotentiaries.â
As a cessation of arms on the Continent, has
alfobren agreed on, in order to give-time
to fettle the various points which mud come
under discussion, we may hope that the ap
pointment of a Congress may lead to a fa
vorable result. From the particulars \yhich
are already known, we difcoverthe cheering
profpeft of a general peace.
But whatever may be the ultimate effeft
of the peace between Auflria and France,'
one material advantage is certain to he deri
ved by this country from that eventâthe
drain of cash from England to Vienna will
henceforward cease, and the vote of Parli
ament will only be to cover the advances hi
therto made to his Imperial Majesty. Such
is the purport of a declaration made in the
House of Commons last night, by the chan
cellor of the Exchecquer.
In regard to the Ecclesiastical Ele&orates
and every thing which relates to the new ar
rangements of the terrkories on the Rhine,.
which heretofore made a part of the Ger
manic Empire, those the House of Austria,
could not of itfelf surrender : and upon these
points it is agreed that there lhall be held a
Congress.
The dispatches brought by Mr. Baflct,
in addition to the intelligence above stated, !
mention the disastrous condition of the Im- |
perial armies, prior ro the preliminaries of j
Peace being signed, as related in the official ,
letters contained in tha last French papers.
On the receipt of the news from the con
tinent yesterday, consols rose to 5 1, but they
afterwards gradually fell to 48.

derable importance. It appears that gov
