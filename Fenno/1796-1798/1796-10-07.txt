ExtrjS of an Address from a candidate for the office
of Eledor of Prefdent and Vite-Prejtdent of the cc
United States, publipsed in the Alexandria paper.
0Â»e of the charges against Mr. Jeffeifen, to j;,
which ray former address alludes,, is, that at a meet-
ing of Mr. Butr, 'of New-York, a man of confi- n(
. derable talenjs, and one who has been as violent an t j.
oppofer to the present government and its adnaini- p (
ftration as any in America, with several gentlemen j
of this (late equally violent in their politics, at MÂ» g[
Jefferfon's hout'e, in October last, the rash and vio
lent measures brought forward irt the last feffioo of p (
congress, which m<*ft df us then thought, and 1
(till think, would hare led this country into a war jj
with Britain, were planned and approved of by
Mr. Jefferfon ; who, it is said, wrote to the differ- y (
ent southern members, urging them to persevere in g
the line of condud there agreed. In proof oi this, ~j
r it is also said, a letter of hi 3 will bi shown: and
should these things be made appear, I cannot hefi- ti
*ate to declare, that I will not vote for him. w
Wjth refpeft tÂ« Mr. Adams, whose conduct ha 3 ar
(hewn that he is a friend to the present government, b:
> it has been the policy of those unfriendly to it to
charge him with ant I republican principles, and an f e
attachment to monarchy ; and have qHoted a book
called Adams's Defence, to prove that he poffeÃes f e
such sentiments. 1 have read that book with at- |â
tention, and find nothing in it to juftify that charge, ki
It bieathes, throughout the whole, as far as I am
capable of judging, the purcft lepublican princt- cc
pies. " ei
But greatly to be lamented, and to t-he diigrace d
of this country, it is said two paities are formed in ao
it, one in favour of the French, and the other the' va
British. I deteÃ them both, and think it may be
well feared, that with these party principles iu our f u
rulers, we may became a prey to one oifcthe other. _
We are told, that Mr. Ames, when he was in this p,
country, said, that the people of New-England te
looked on Mr. Adams as a man attached t* the t j,
British party, and that in his opinion they would
vote for Mr. Henry as President in preference to
Mr. Ames and the people there know
Mr. Adams better than we do ; and if he made
â¢ such a declaration, 1 (hould think it contlufive evi
dence. My wish is, that we may fix upcD such d<
chara&ers as will give their whole attention to the Â«Ji
interest of their own country, leaving foreign na
j tion6 to a& for thcmfelvls in the fame manner, if â
r they chufe ta do so.âAnd it is for this reason that
f Ido at present feel disposed to vote for Mr. Henry
and Mr. Pinekney, as President and Vice Presi
dent. If these gentlemen should not be candidates,
and either Mr. Jefferfoa or Mr. Adams mud be
President, it would become the duty of your Elcc- ta
tors to vote for the one*who, from,the best infor- ~
mation, may be least exceptionable. G

CHARLESTON, 16. at
Died an Tuesday morning, of a painful illness,
which had continued several weeks, Mrs, Hannah
Sproat Keith, the amiable confott of the nÂ».-erend
doAor Keith, of this city, and daughter of the [5
late reveiend do&or James Sproat, of Philadelphia, v "
who, with a great part of his family, fell vidlims k.
to the yellow fever in the jear 1793. /Â«
j This truly excellent lady, in addition to a good P'
i underftar.ding aod the moral and social virtues
â¢ which adorned her character, was eminentljftdiftin- "
, gui(hed by her genuine and vital piety.
, Long had the felt the force of that great truth, a
' to glorify God is the most desirable end of human fÂ£
life. This principle hath so fully taken posses
sion of her heart, that for several of her last yeais,
she appeared to a& continually under its governing
e influence': and while (he exemplified true religion
' is its excellency and importance, in her own tem
â ' per and conduct, she did not fail to to improve eve
ry favourable opportunity for recommending it to
others, .in a kind, engaging manner, by her con-
verfation ; the influence of which, there is jull rea
son to believe, will be felt by many, and especially
by the younger part of her friends, through the re
mainder of their lives.
In these pious a&s of friendship (lie found de
- lightful employment while on earth ; but the knew
5 that "to depart and be with Christ, was far bet
- ter."
Her remains, accompanied by a very numerous
y train of refpeftable and weeping friends, weie con
- veyed on Wedr.efday to the Independent church,
in Archdale street, aVid depafited in the cemetery ,
n adjoining to that place of. worfltip ; on which oc- /

f, Some members of the national affeir.bly having c<
s, in one of the late fittings, attributed the desertion P'
s ' of the Batavian troops to their being placed in the al
firft line j and this assertion being denied by other as
I- members, as well as the comraitte of union for as. 1
fairs en landâ . w
"Head-quarters, Utrecht, Â»8 Prairial (i6thjune) c<

" one and indivisible. w
i " Citizens, , tJ
:e " I read in the public papers, the ridiculous de tl
,f claration of fomedeputies refpetting the motives for ci
c, desertion in the Batavian troops, ascribing it tiÂ»
lheir being placed in tlve fiift line, when they (hould '
n be in the second, &c. q
" When the Batavien convention placed under
f- my command the army of the republic, it imposed
le on me no conditions about placieg it in the firrt or o!
y second line ; and this mark of its extreme confi-
y t dence has impressed me with gratitude. In return a
â  0 for that confidence, and for yosra also, citizens I
s, am eager to inform you, tliat the delcrtion has 'no
:s other source than the scarcity of provisions and neb
ceflai iesâfo scanty and dear, that they who are paid tl
;d in moneycaraat procure them in their canton, ci
!- menu. To feed your foldicrs, it the true means "of tl
e preventing desertion ; and you need look for Do t<
other. t j
t "It mud a!fo be observed, that your regiments d
did not make war to support your revolution ; and V
ie possibly there may be individuals amougft them p
who do not like it: far, therefore, from blaming ci
â  thsir emigration, lam cx> cdiug!/ to^fir>d
r none rem inijut the true patriots, whose ardor and
,i coinage can alone support it.
" Would it not be equally extravagant and tm
politic on my part, to place behind me in the second
t0 line troops, in whom I can have no confidence ? <
:t " And should the enemy appear before me, would it <
f'" not be putting myfelf between two fires, in cafe
a . n they (houlf) have an understanding with the fuf
individuals that may be amongst your troops?
en 1 repeat itâthis emigration is, perhaps salutary ;
?â¢ and 1 would rather give battle with a handful of J
10 * brave men, than with a large army composed of (
poltroons and counter-revolutioni.ls.
1 <1 your troops and they will be in good con- r
,ar dition ; pay them well, and you will retain the
ky brave ; but as to the scoundrels or cowards, I tell j
cr you once more, you should not interrupt them.
Such is my opinion, which I pray you to commu
'sÂ» uicate to the national assembly, that it may nat be
diverted from more serious considerations âSuch is
the answer 1 \}'D'jld give to those deputies who
would place in the second line those brave Balavi
-183 ans, who, true to their colours, desire only to com
bat in the cause of liberty, and rival the gb'y of
10 the Frensh, who have all along so gallantly de
an fended it.
ok .Â« Xhe committee of union tnuft have already
s een by the nature of my dispositions that 1 know
"â¢ how to do juftite to the Batavian soldiers, and
! c> know how to estimate military talents.
" For a manth, lieutenant-general Dumoreeau
ci * commanded the three divisions of the line ; and for
eight days lieutenant-genemj Daendals has fuc
cc cteded him. At this moment, three battalions
,n , aod four Bataviao squadrons are moving to join the
he vanguard of the French, Rationed between Ntme
be guen and DuiTeldorf, to cover he lafV place, and.
ur support the left army of the Sambre and the Metife
'[â¢ âI wi(h them to partake the glory which the

LONDON, Monday Aug. 22.
> On Saturday the Paris papers of. the 15th and
' i6rh instant, were received after our paper was at
1 pref* They contain the official accounts of the
c late successes of the French in Italy, of which we
had before only the fubltance in an official meflagc
fen by the directory to the council of five-hundre 1.
They contain besides, some fiffi-ial details refpei. 1 -
ting the operations ol the array of the Sambre and â¢
iffeufe.
This morning we received the Paris Journals of
the 17th, 18th and 19th in ft. They contain a It-t
---" ter from General Buorfaparte, which our readers
5 will fiad in its proper phce* giving an account of
the raising of the siege of Pefchiera, and the re
capture of Verona by the French troops
to which the Auftrians made a last ineffectual ef
fort to retrieve their,affairs. The wretched remains
of the Imperial troops, have taken refuge in Ty
rol. The Paris Journals also contain some official
letters ftom the army of the Sambre and Meufe,
I they arc of dates anterior to those which we
â  have given in the preceding uolumns from the Pa.
riÂ» papers Which reached uj 011 Saturday, and affyrd
only details of operations, the result of which is al
ready known : .we therefore pultpone until to-mor

tance, that we may reserve room for the contents
Â®f the
j HAMBURGH MAIL,
Which arrived this morningâThe accounts which
it brings rcfpc&ing the operations-os the war is
Germany, are. not of a later date than those from
the French papers. They contain, however, forr.e
' important particulars not before known. The ac
counts from Italy are only details of the fliort
lived advantages which general Wurmfer had gain
-1 ed before the tide of victory had again turned in
favbur of the French, and enabled them to gain
those successes which have been detailed at inch,
length by Buonaparte in his dispatches to the di
rectory. These we lhall lay before our readers to
morrow.
! The political state of Germany seems fact halting
to that crisis which we'have more than once called
to the attention of our readefs. The little states
and free cities are now only talked of as make
weights in the general adjultmeut of the greater
interest ; rtrd it is nÂ»t impoffibL*, will be coniidered
"as divisible spoil, and treated like wretched Poland,
j âBut all this i 3 perhaps as neceflary as the war itÂ«
felf was to prevent thefpread of revolutionary prin
ciples, to maintain regular government, and to se
cure individual property !

have reached us before our readers. They are aÂ®

breitftein ate to be abandoned to the French ; and
the republican troops arc to retreat to a certain

is to meet at Hair.au. â This congress is to be coo*

public. All the powers which have taken a part
in the coalition are to fend thither deputies ; and
after the treaty between the two furrper powers is
concluded, the difference between the others are
be arranged, and the lalt hand put to a general
peace.

ExtraS of an Address from a candidate for the office n
of Eledor of Pre/idcnt and Vice-Pr-ejident of the c
United States, published in the Alexandria paper.
0Â»e of the charges against Mr. JefFeifsn, to ;;
which my former address alludes, is, that at a meet-
ing of Mr. Butr, 'of New-York, a man of confi- â
, detable talenjs, and one who has been as violent an t |
oppofer to the present government and its admini- p
ftration as any in America, with several gentlemen j
of this (late equally violent in their politics, at MÂ» a
Jefferfon's hout'e, in October last, the rath and vio- j,
lent measures brought forward irt the lait feffioo of p
congress, which nvft df us th*n thought, and 1
(till think, would have led this country into a war j
with Britain, were planned and approved of by
Mr. Jefferfon ; who, it is said, wrote to the differ- y
cnt southern members, urging them to persevere in g
the line of coodud there agreed. In proof oi this, â
it is also said, a letter of hi 3 will bi (hown: and j
(hould these things be made appear, I cannot hefi- t ]
*ate to declare, that I will not vote for him. w
Wjth refpeS tÂ« Mr. Adams, whose conduct ha 3 a
(hewn that he is a friend to the present government, j,
it has bean the policy of those unfriendly to it to t ]
charge him with auti republican principles, and an f,
attachment to monarchy ; and have qHoted a book
called Adams's Defence, to prove that he poffefifes f (
such sentiments. 1 have read that book with at- |,
tention, and find nothing in it to jufttfy that charge. k
It bteathes, throughout the whole, as far as I am
capable of judging, the purest lepublican princt- c ,
pies. " Â£
But greatly to be lamented, and to t-he diigrace CJ
of this country, it is said two panics are formed in a
it, one in favour of the French, and the other the' vi
Britifli. I detest them both, and think it may be p
well feared, that with these party principles in our f t
rulers, we may become a prey to one oÂ»the other. _
We are told, that Mr. Ames, when he wa9 in this p
country, said, that the people of New-England t <
looked on Mr. Adams as a man attached to the t j
British pprty, and that in his opinion they would
vote for Mr. Henry as President in prefeieuce to
Mr. Ames and the people there know
Mr. Adams better than we do ; and if he made
such a declaration, 1 (hould think it contlufive evi
dence. My wi(h is, that we may fix upcD such di
characters as will give their whole attention to the d
interest of their own country, leaving foreign na
tions to a& for themfelvls in the fame manner, if -
they chufe to do so.âAnd it is for this reason that
1 do at present feel disposed to vote for Mr. Henry
aad Mr. Pinekney, as President and Vice Prefi
| dent. If these geÃtlemen (ho.uld not be candidates,
[ and either Mr. Jefferfoa or Mr. Adams mud be &
, President, it would become the duty of your Elcc- t<
tors to vote for the one*who, from.the best in for- "
matioÃ, may be least exceptionable. G

1 which had continued several weeks, Mrs. Hannah

to the yellow fever in the jear 1793. /Â«
This truly excellent lady, in addition to a good P
undemanding aad the moral and social virtues
which adorned her character, was cminentljftpliftin- "
, guifhed by her genuine and vital piety.
Long had (he felt the force of that great truth, a
to glorify God is the most desirable end of human f!
life. This principle had* so fully taken poflef
fion of her heart, that for several of her last yeais,
(he appeared to aft continually under its governing
; influence": aÃd while (he exemplified true religion
is its excellency and importance, in her own tem-
I per and conduct, (he did not fail to to improve eve
ry favourable opportunity for recommending it to
others, -in a kind, engaging manner, by her con- J'
verfation ; the influence of which, there is jult rea
son to believe, will be felt by many, and especially
by the younger part or her friends, through the re
mainder of their lives.
In these pious a6ts of friendftiip (he found de
lightful employment while on earth ; but the knew

" Citizens, ,
e " I read in the public papers, the ridiculous de ti
f claration of fomedeputies refpetting the motives for c
, defertiou in the Batavian troops, ascribing it to
â¢ their being placed in tlve firft line, when they (hould
3 be in the feeond, &c. q
" When the Batavian convention placed under
- my command the army of the republic, it imposed
e on me no conditions about placing it in the firft or o
y fecoid liue ; and this mark of its extreme coufi
Â£ dence has imprefled me with gratitude. In return a
a for that confidence, and for yours also, citizens I
1, am eager to inform you, that the delcrtion has 'no
5 other source than the scarcity of provisions and neb
ceflariesâfo feasty anddear, that they wha are paid t
d in money, cannat procure them in their canton- c
. menu. To feed your soldiers, is the true means "of t
0 preventing desertion ; and you need look for Do t
e other. t
" It mud also be ob(erved, that your regiments d
did not make war to support your revolution ; and \
e possibly there may be individuals amougft thera p
who do not like it: far, therefore, from blaming c
thsir emigration, I afn ex> cdiogly plejfcd to find
none rem in-but the true patriots, whose ardor and
coinage can alone support it.
* 'â¢ Would it not be equally extravagant and im
politic on my part, to place behind me in the feconci
0 line troops, in whom I can have no confidence ? c
;â  And (hould the enemy appear before me, would it c
'* not be putting myfeif between two lires, in Caie
n they (hoald have an understanding with t!ie fuf
'* peiied individuals that may be amongst your troops?
n 1 repeat itâthis emigration is, perhaps, salutary ;
* and 1 would rather give battle with a handtul of j
brave men, than with a large army ccmpofed of
poltroons and counter-revolutionists.
1 <> p eet J your troops and they will be in good con- r
lr dition j pay them well, and you will retain the
Y brave ; but as to the scoundrels or cowards, I tell j
r you once more, you (hould not interrupt them.
" Such is my opinion, which I pray you to commu
- 3Â» uicate to the national aflembly, that it may nst be
diverted from more serious considerations âSuch is
the answer I \yould give to those deputies who
would place in the second line those brave Balavi
-13 ans, who, true to their colours, desire only to com
bat in the cause of liberty, and rival the glo'y of
0 the Frensh, who have alt along so gallantly de
n fended it.
â¢" The committee of union uiuft have already
5 seen by the nature of my dispositions that I know
'â¢ how to do juftite to the Batavian soldiers, and
kHow how to estimate military talents.
P " For a manth, lieutenant-general Dumoreeau

LONDON, Monday Aug. 22.
Ofl Saturday the Paris papers of. the 15th and
16rh instant, were received after our paper was at
pref* They contain the official accounts of the
â  late successes of the French in Italy, of which we
had before only the fubltance in an official nveffagc
fen by the directory to the council of five-hundre 1.
They contain besides, some fiffi-ial details refpei. 1 -
ting the operations ol the array of the Sambre and â¢
ifteufe.
This morning we received the Paris Journals of
the 17th, 18th and 19th in ft. They contain a let
ter from General Buorfaparte, which our readers
5 will fisd in its proper place* giving an account of
the raising of the siege of Pefchiera, and the re
capture of Verona by the French troops
to which the Auftriaus made a last ineffectual ef
fort to retrieve their,afftirs. The wretched remains
of the Imperial troops, have taken refuge in Ty
rol. The Paris Journals also contain some official
letters ftom the army of the Sambre and Meufe,
I ,but they arc of dates anterior to those which we
â  have given in the preceding nolurans from the Pa.
riÂ» papers Which reached uj 011 Saturday, and affyrd
only details of operations, the result of which is al
ready known : .we therefore pultpone until to-mor

j HAMBURGH MAIL,
Which arrived this morningâThe accounts itfhieh
it brings refpc&ing the operations-os the war is
Germany, are. not of a later date than those from
the French papers. They contain, however, some
' important particulars not before known. The ac
counts from Italy are only details of the fliort
lived advantages which general Wurmfer had gain
-1 ed before the tide of victory had again turned in
favbur of the French, and enabled them to gain
those successes which have been detailed at inch,
length by Buonaparte in his dispatches to the di
rectory. These we lhall lay before our readers to
morrow.
! The political state of Germany seems fact halting
to that crisis which we'have more than once called
to the attention of our readefs. The little states
and free cities are now only talked of as make
weights in the general adjultmeiit of the greater
iutereft ; rtrd it is nÂ»t impoffibL*, will be coniidered
"as divisible spoil, and treated like wretched Poland,
j âBut all this i 3 perhaps as necessary as the war itÂ«
felf was to prevent thefpread of revolutionary prin

cure individual property !

e FRANKFORT, August.6.
Well informed persons pofuively state that ne
* gociations far an armistice are on foot. Accord
j ing to them the fortreifes ot Mentz and Ehren
breitftein ate to be abandoned to the French ; and
the republican troops arc to retreat to a certain
r line of demarkation, to the end, that they may
3 not interrupt the operations of the congress, which
is to meet at Hair.au. â This congress is to be coo*
! vened by the emperor, jointly with the French re
public. All the powers which have taken a part
in the coalition are to fetid thither deputies ; and
after the treaty between the two furrpcr powers is
concluded, the difference between the others are
be arranged, and the lait hand put to a general
peace.
Among the effe&s lately seized by' the French
between Wurtzbourg and Oemunden, was the câ
i quipage of the imperial envoy, count de Shlick ;
together with all the public and piivate plate be
louging to the bishopric and bishop of Liege, as
well as the piate of several of the rich abbeys of

""1 he king of France-wag on his way to seek a
refuge at Dresden; but he was met at Amberg by

The latest advices from the upper rhine, dated f(
the 4th inltant, announce that the French army has c
made anolKfer general movement. The division of ti
General Labordt, which eroffed the Rhine at Hun- v
ingen, aftpr having taken poffefiion of Constance f
. and Stockach, left a body of troops in the rear to p
facilitate its jundtion with the army of the Alps, p
and proceeded up the right bank of the Danube, o
This manoeuvre, which was intended to oblige e
the Anftrians to recrofs that river rapidly, produ.- h
eed in a great measure the effedt : on the lit and a
2d in!t. the Imperialists retreated from the posts f
they occupied in the county of Rechtfberg on the t
Steig, and from those near Geiflengen, to proceed r
to different points of the Danube. In eonfequence v
of these movements the while of General Moreau's ti
army advanced ; and at the departure of these ad- I
vices was advanced rapidly towards th; Danifbe, b
which river the Auftrians had not as yet entirely F
eroffed. General St. Cyr, commandant of the cen- c
tre of the army of the Rhine and Moselle,. had
fhifted his head quarters from Goeppingan to Doni- a
dorff near Heidenheim. General Defaix, who b
commands the left wing was at Getnund ; and the t
commander io chief had jutt sfta-blifhed his head- t
quarters'at Schondorff. t
The army ot the Sambre and Meufe, and that f
Â« of General Wartenfleben, opposite to it, have been r
. perfectly tranquil since the affair of the 27th ulti- t
mo. According to the latest advices, the Austrian f
General had his head-quarters at Zeil ; he ha{) ex
tended his wings, as if he meant to resume offen- v
five operations. Since the flight of the balloon, Â£
nothing has passed either at Mentis or at Ehrenbreit- 'â 
ften. a
On the 7th, after the eighteen hoflaf/s had been 1
carried off, another ediift was published concerning 3
the payment of the contributions, and to avert the t
Yiolcut-meafures which threatfn our city, the Se- I
nate has jutt acquainted the inhabitants, that, in a
cafe they were not immediately assisted in the belt t
poflible manner, the deftrudtion of this city and its li
conflitution, within a few days, would be unavoida
ble. Every inhabitant was again fammoned, with- c
in hours, to deliver in allcafh and plate 1'
that could be found, to save our city. a
Much as our city has till now refufej to accept 1
the offer of the Landgrave of Hesse Caffel to ad- 1"
vance the money necessary for paying the contribu- f
tions ~by the French, it now finds itfelf v
under the nccefficy of accepting that offerâa_ step f
which may be produdtive of (Jilagreeable confc- a
quences. Ytlterday negoeiations were opened for, c
that purpose by our Senate with the Hessian Mini- f
fter, Baron de Waitz. To day that painifter, ac a
compnr.ied by the French Ambassador, Citizen Ri- *
val, departed from hence.
It is now publicly said that owr city will foonbe under C

We have not yet learnt what success the deputa

Should they rot be able to obtain a complete neu

Archives and fervaiits, as well the security of

f and dispersion of mighty armies, of the sbjedt hjiÂ», jq
e miliaiion and impending ruin of the greateff powers rie j
- âin one word, of events which seem to us to be w i
e little less than a pfelude to the total deltrudtion of alfi
e the established fyftcm of Europe. of
s It was natural and reasonable that the imperial ma
coart should confidcr Italy as the quarter in which
olone the French could be vulnerable. An army ; j o
j scattered over an extensive country, and occupied in
3 containing a re.tlefs and mutinous people, seemed fuf
f to present many favourable points of attack. To
- wards Italy, therefore, the efforts of Austriaaap t 0
e pear to have been diredtecfc 'It was even thought te
3 politic to weaken the army of the archduke, for the
, purpose of reinforcing Wuimfer, and a large body
. of men were detached for that objedt. By these , ftt
e extraordinary exertions, general Wurmfer found
.. himfelf at the head of a .gallant and well difqiplined Gr
j army of 60,000 men ; and that excellent officer
s seems to have thought himfelf in a condition to raifc '
e the tiege of Mantua, and perhaps effeiS the recove- v j'
d ry of Lortibardy. His firft fuceeffes corresponded j, s
c with the hopes that have been formed from so for- dÂ«i
s midable a foice. On the 29th ult. he drove the
- French from the post of Salo,. situated an the left w '
bank of the Lago di Garda, and shortly after ex- ul
y pelled them from Brefciaj the capital of the Bref- ' a
- ciano. Tel
j These successes, however, proved as short lived j m
. as' they were trivial. The army of Buonaparte had
0 been reinforced by-25,000 men from La Vendse â lig
e that unfortunate celebrated country, through which un
the combined powers so long hoped to give a mor- t ' v
tal wound to the French republic, but whieh has in
t fadt proved the grave of the royalifls, and the belt
n nursery of republican soldiers. He withdrew his as
. troops from Verona, and concentrating his whole w<
n force, he marched without delay against Wurrsfer. Pc-
I'he dates and particulars of the astonishing events N
. which followed, are so imjjerfedt, that we can only
, give a very general them. It appears, c Â°
however, that Buonaparte attacked the Auftrians
at Lonado and Salo ; and at the firft of these places trt
n made 600 prisoners, and killed 2000 men. On the th<
t 3d instant, be agaia attacked them in the whole ex- cit
e tent of their lineâat Lonado, Caftiglionne, and ' n
- Montechiaro, with such fiiccefs, a3 to have killed m
n and wounded 2000, taken 30 field-pieces, and made
t 6000 prisoners, among whom were two gcneial of
-8 ficers. 5^
What the particulars Â»f the events whieh fuc
. ceeded this great vidtory were, we have not yet
e learnt ; but Xuch has been their astonishing and j
awful result, that in five days (probably from the
t lit to the 6th inft) twelve thousand Auftrians have Tl
. been made prisoners, fix thonfand have been killed,
. seventy pieces of cannon have been laken, and their p
f whole army have been completely routed and dif- Ti
j> perfrH Icj this short pxriod uas becu nfmiliil tcd
- a numerous, brave and disciplined araiy, command
r, ed by one of the mod celebratedgeneralsof his age ; .
. for the formation of wHiieh such extraordinary efforts j- r
and faCrifices were made ; which was the sole bul m
I- walk of Germany on the Italian frontier, and in w
which were depojited the last, faint hopes of the 111
r Court of Vienna.
At a calmer momeot we might express our afto
nifhmeht at these ftupendousi and almost incredible t ;,
events, and pay a due tribute of admiration to the vi
. flcfll and valor lyliicfi have wrought such prodigies ;
j. but astonishment and admiration are loft in feelings
i, of a more awful kivrd, in the relation of vidtories,
o which threaten nothing less than the univetfal fubju- j;i
b gation of Europe. The French are now the unÂ» et
difpntcd masters of Italy, from the Alps to the R
0 Straits of Messina j and whether They parcel it in
to dependant republics, or (till for a while, fuffer its 8
wretched princes, trembling in their palaces, to
retain a precarious and nominal authorityâit is in ri
le truth and iubltance a province of France. . o
:- If turn our eyes towards Germany, the prof- tl
pedt appears, if poflible, still more clouded and
et gloomy. The Diet of the Empire, assembled at a
>e Ratisbon 011 the 30th ult. in.the lift agony of dif- e
:h may and consternation, passed a decree (whish may t ,
:h perhaps, be one of the last adts Â©f power they will n
ie ever exercise I) for imploring the/French to grant e
a peace to the Germanic Body. They accused the P
Emperor of having protradted Hostilities ; and his ll
minister recriminated, by afctibing all the ca'amities
1- of the war to their inactivity and pulillanimity ; ,
et accusations which may both in part be true âBut
e- on what a miserable and desperate footing they must (
in negociate, tnay be judged from the circumstance,
ie that they found it necessary to fend a deputation of
- their own number to the French generals, fuppli
u- eating them to grant protedtion to their persons and r
re archives | and that they have been compelled to
a- employ the mediation ot the King of Prussia for
:ir the fame humiliating objedt. It is a gross abuse of j
of language, to dignify by the name of negociation,
the igHominious teims which a conqueror may ehufe
:h to didtate to those who are reduced to implore his
ut protedtion.
ir- Thus is ihis proud Affemblv, the rcprefenrative of the
i, e greatest .number ut princes and ftatei that were ever united
1 in a political affectation, obliged to depend for its per- -|
1 fonal fafety upon the precarious mercy â¢'nd accidental J
~ > Â° moderation of those who may command the armies of
ur France. I his wretched humiliation is not alcue deferr
ing of notice as an awefuf and memorable example of
"e- the vicififitude of human affairs ; he must be a ihallow
in politician indeed, who docs not perceive that fuels 1
H fiances of humiliation are likely to be productive of the
' molt terrible conferences. A vi<Â£lory over the dignity
of the established governments of Europe is as import
ant to the French democracy as a vidlory over their ar
mies. The one diffufes their opinions is much as the
other extends their territories. When the people ef e
â¢very country fee ail that has been the object of their ve- 1
neration for so many ages, degraded and laid proflrate j
'y> in the dull ; their reverence will be changed into conr
ur tempt ; All the sentiments which produce obedience to

been ever jufiiv 3cc,ount;d cr.c of the chief bulwarks P;
of the eflabllfued system of Europe, ij thus rapidly a ]
t tumbling to pieces, the fttuation of the Emp;ror ap- j ( j
pears to be equally mortifying and unfortunate. Even {
' the pallant fpirn of Hungarian Loyalty, which has of
ten, in the raoft delperate moments, sustained the tot.
3 tering fortuiles of the Bouse of Austria, has, on this
' occasion, f'orfaken him. Hungary has jpeen.deaf to
i thg voice of its diflieffed sovereign. which in other on
e times has produced such powerful effeels on that mar- C J
t tial people. . . .' th
We have received authentic intelligence that ,
Klebei lias entered Ratifbon ; but the particulars of his
s negociation (for so it-will still be ridiculouHy called !) a '
J with the captive diet, have uot reached us. We have so
f alio the bell realon to believe that some wretched terms of
of capitulation, which, by the covirtefy of Europe, c g
| may be called a Treaty of Peace, have ere this been m;
j granted by the French to the Emperor at Munich.
The term Negociation may be applied tofuch traufac- .
tiom, but negociation implies at least some equality.
1 There is no negotiation between a conqueror and a
1 suppliant. an
Whether the vi&orious Republicans will condescend ef
. to listen to the fuppiicaflons of Mr. Pitt, and vouehfafe t e
t te include him in the conditions which they may grant j )e
e to the govcrmnems ot Europe on their surrender, we ! / ,
know not j and arpidfl the draggling sentiments of
y flame, sorrow, terror and indignation, which at this ce
Â£ moment fill our minjls, we had almo'd said we care not. a ''
J The probability feeinp rather against a peace with to
J Great-Britain. The Emperor is too much overwhelm- ta
r td by hi. own calamities and danger*, and too urgent- co
c W prelTed by tlie necessity of an immediate accommo
dition, to be solicitous about the intereds of an ally,
whose delirucflive frieiHlfhip has been the source of all 1
Â® h ! misfortunes : and in the race of suppliant ambaffa- j
- dors to l'aris, Mr. Hammond seems likely to be outrun. tu
e The dctellation of the Republicans against a minister o'
: t wiote incendiary intrigues they believe to have llirred 21
uj: all their foreign and domestic enemies, is still unex- zc
hajfted ; and they can have little inducement to grant ej
temis, however humiliating, to a power wht>m they ,
m:y injure materially, and which can scarcely, in any 0
" importjnt interest, injure them. m
d We are perfeflly sensible that some part of the intel- th
- ligence may b.e called ineoiifident with that earned and ca
(j uniform delire of Peace, which we have exprefied since
the commencement of this, unfortunate conted. But
n there will nor be the real inconGdency in the
, condudl of the warmest enemies of the War, if they
reprobate vith equal warmth such conditions of peace
8 as Mr, Pitt is likely to obtain. The contrary esndufl l '
e would in fail be grossly inconfiflent. His ignominious pi
â . Peace will be the natural fruit of his abominable War. pi

the batteries on the Nprth East end of Porquerol
le with an easy fail, in hopes I Ihould be taken for

is of thf enemy's ship before I was difcoveted, and
-> cautioned the captain through a trumpet not to
n make a fruiilefs reliftance, when he immediately
snapped his pillol at me and tired his broadside.
At this period, being very near the heavy battery
r j of Fort Bregahfon, 1 laid him inilantly on board,
and lieutenant Lydiard, at the head of the board
d ess, with an intrepidity no words can describe, enÂ»
tered and carried tier in about ten minutes, although
he met with afpiritcd resistance from the captain
