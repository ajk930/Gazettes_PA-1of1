in which admir-: 1 Nelson has been conquer- 3

however, are unconfirmed reports, deferring v

It is likewite said, that fame 6f the French n;

Augufl 29. Th
We yefterJay presented to our readers the t
various reports from the continent, of an f
a&ion having taken place between Horatio
Nelion ants Buonaparte's fleet. These re
ports, it mull be admitted, contain nothing (
circumftancial respecting the action, men
tioning neither the place where, nor the
time when it took place; but from the va
rious channels through which this news has ?
reached us, the increasing report* from the in J>
xontinent, and the obvious probability of ..
the event, little doubt rests on our minds 1
that it has aftually taken place ; and we
kr.ow enough rf the superiority of British ,
seamen, and of the enterprifiÃg and gallant Â° 1
spirit of admiral Nclfon, to be attired of the !"' 0U
happiett result.
The credit of the accounts of yefler'day, ro ]
however, do not refl entirely upon the arti C f U .
c!es ejLtradled from the German and Italian ?
journalsâMany private le'tera from diffa- ?
rent parts of the continent, and particularly a ". <
from Hamburgh of the 21 ftsjnft. mention,
that accounts had been received of that 3
great event, to which the eyes of all Europe f re '
arc turned with so much anxiety and ex- .
peftation. a meeting of the two hostile fleets U
in 1 lie Mediterranean having taken place; I" 10 "
the letitrsfrom Hamb-irgh to which we al- ''i,
lude. and ore of which we subjoin, are of W 'i
the befl authority, and Rate tint the English . 1
ajjent at Leghorn had publicly announced
that admiral Melfon had obtained a vi&ory, Â£
and the French conftil was remarked to 8
pr;-ferve the moil gloomy fileoce. The Â° W ,?
action is fnppofed to have taken place near PÂ°.!r
Alexandria, and it is even conjectured that !j j
it happened before any pact of the French .
. fleet had reached that port. Itisftatedin 'J 00
the Florence article- by the Hamburgh . r
rr all, that the commanders of both fleets had
been killed, and in another article that Bus e r
cHaparte oaly had fallen. These,. it mu
a jÂ°y l
be allowed, aie only general aÂ»d vague re- "Â°} '
ports, but it appears '.Â© us that they would Â£ a '
foarcrly be fa genera', or foofien repeated, f Â°. r
if they had not some foundation in faft. rient
The best informed people entertain little tx- . W '
pcÂ«tati'yn of official or au'hentic intelligence
from Sir Hcratio Nelson's fleet reaching
London, till towards the close of the pre
ftnt month. Such intelligence may be 1
hourly expelledâthat it will be cheering

When Tall'yrar.d undertakes in his last
note to Mr. Gerry to contrajf the condua w
1S of the two governments, it would fecm that ti
,i s Mr. Gerry had at last really given him the E
all diceur to turlefque the " terrible republic."
ch In h.is survey of the'cOndnft of France, he
has completely described the forbeara-ce of
the American government : In thepretended
violence of the American government he has
displayed a jail piaure of the conduit of M
F â _ V
The American editors in their remarks on n:
the fecent correspondence between Mr. ft
S * Gerry and Talleyrand, fecm totally at a
loss to discover what the French minister
meansâand it must be confeffed that this P
confufion arises i > a great decree from the 1
confufed manner in whigh be has expressed
ser himfelfâOne editor supposes that the firm
llrs ness of onr government has al last wrought j
a pacific change in the policy of France,and
na ~ founds this opinion on Talleyrand's anxiety
to negociate, and the forroni he expresses at Â»
the profpea of hofti'.itiesâWe may, how
ien ever, fafdy rely, that this pretended cuxicty
nS and [arrow arc not the working of a contrite
1<? ." fp' r,t â  Talleyrand is no doubt to the
e j.' foul at the disclosure of his infamy and cor- _
, rnption ; and the gloomy difcontcnt of his
lie mind appears to pervade his correfpon- )
denes ; but we have more reason to flip- f
lrt " pose that this state of mind would inCrcale 1
a ' e his malignity, thaa engsuders remoafe. This 1
malignity will disguise at the fame time '
lee that it embitters the draught that is preparing ;
f for us. We ought to believe every thing j 1
l . , C fooncr than the prof fiions of tÂ». French i "
' government : We ought to txoea any â¢
thing sooner than the fulfilment of their I
promises. They mult have loft, before this ;

J, country âTheir only objea,will now he to

the paffitjg of this aft, a just and true account
of their claims to the bounty or CongrcK.
See. 2. And be it further enaiied, That no
