(Gonti'iii'd from yeflerdat's Cup t'e. 1
By this ftatetjient it appears, thi't the {
eolfee was thrown into the dock and not 1
upon the wnarf, as itated by Dr. Riifh ; >
and I know from perfru.' inflection, that
the dock into wliieh the damaged coffee was ! J
t!hro,wn was always covered at flÂ«Â»d tide ; 1
hence any effluvia mud have been prevented t
from riling iiom that source. That no <
morbid effects were produced by that fold <
on the wh?vf. is evident from all the enfes :
which occurred for the fir ft two weekj being
confined to one* neighbourhood, or to per- <
fotÂ»"> who ha-d intercourse with the inhabit- 1
ants of that neighbourhood
If the {vlge water could Haye given n'fe ]
â to the ditefe, no commercial city would 1
t'ver life free from it in the fifmmer season.
To the argument offet-ed in support of :
, the effluvia frrym the damaged coffee pro
ducing the dife?fe, becaiife the failore were
indifpo'fed while clearing the hold, it may
be replied that their indispositions were too
mild n; ' -f too (liort duration, to give
fi.yport to iwch an opinion.
1 we learn from the writings of the ex-
Lind and Blanc, that it is com
mon for people to be made giddy and ij'rk
by the effluvia from putrid bilge water,
and that the gases generated in the eonfined 1
holds of fiftU mips, from, whence frelh air
bail been.long excluded, has, like the fixed
air of fermenting liquwrs, occafipned in,
fiat death to perform incautioufi.y or fud
dfilly exposed to it, before the holds have
been ventilated or exposed to the aceVfx /if
frefn air; but there is no mention hi either
of these authors, or in any others shnt
have come to my knowledge, where they
have occasioned a fever even of the mil deft
kind, much 'ess a malignant and contagious
fever. The effluvia which arise from putrid
coffee are precisely the fame as those which
arise from putrid .grafj and other herbs,
from the leaves and hark of plants aud trees,
ami from almpft every other kind of jiptrid
Vegetable: hence, if the effluvia of putrid
coffee ever produces any kind of fever, it
mttft produce the fame kind as other putrid
Vegetables '; but the effluvia ot other putrid
vegetables never produce any fever but ore
of an mtermittiiig kind, which are never
eonfagfeus, of which the remitting fever,
whether r.ccorrpr.oi<d with bilious evacua
tion* or not, is only a variety, rendered
"flS&rcnt only by the difference of the con
iKtutions or condition of the persons affect
ed by the aÂ£ting cause ; that is, if the cause
operate upon a patient with a phlogistic or
inflammatory diathesis, the fever will 'be
accompanied with inflammatory symptoms,
'.and the remissions will be obfeure so leng as
-{hat diathe()B continues. When it operates
upon Â«i patient with the opposite. diathesis,
called the nervous or typhus disposition or
constitution, the remiflionS will also be im
perfect, but the increase or recurrence ot
the febrile fymptojjis will also be moderate,
though the danger may be great. The
circumstances faÂ£ts whiclt have now
been stated, appear fufficient to convince
every impartial enquirer, that a disease of
so malignant a nature as that which occasi
oned such mortality in 1793, could not
arise from the effluvia of damaged coffee or
any other vegetable substance. If tc these
â K e add that such a disease wps never known
'to' be in Philadelphia, or any
other part of the United States of Ame
rica before, hot had altvays been introduced,
when it did occur, by vessels from the Weft
Indies, though the seasons had frequently
been as hot apd dry,'and some more so,
and the streets more replete with putrid ve
getable matter than in 1793. And if we
compare its leading and charafteriftic symp
toms with those of the bilious remitting
fever in its most equivocal and dangerous
I form, as well as with the observations of
all the physicians that have written express
ly on the fubjeft, together with the causes
which give rife to other ceintagiou!' fevers v
110 person acquainted with medical history,
and qualified to discern the connection be
tween cause and effett, can hesitate in be
lieving that the disease never has originated
\ in Philadelphia, nor ever can be occasioned
by putrid vegetable effluvia, but is always,
imported by vessels with sick pevfons or in
fedted goods on board.

Mr. Woods,
I have with pain observed in a confpicu
oua place of the CentiWl of Freedom of
last week, under the .New York head, a
statement intimating that gan. Wilkinfon
had arbitrarily proclaimed military law at
D'Etroit, which had excited great discon
tents, and eaufed tbe merchants and others
to remove to the oppoiite fide of tne Strait.
It is to be lamented that there are to be
found among us, persons base enough to
invent and publifll every fpecits of report
that can pruHbly bring injo disgrace either
our government or its officers. Lut as
there are fueh, it is our duty to defeat their
nefarious policy, b"y detesting and expofmg
them, when in our power.
Having kft D'Etroit iii July last, I feci
myftjlf authorised to contradict the above
statement, and affureyou that it is in'pare
iibfolutely falfe. Admitting it to be a faÂ£t
that the general has proclaimed military
lav, which I think is not improbable;,yet
the' eonclufcn that the proclamation has
produced great discontents, and caused the
merchants ai;d others to leave the place and
form a new settlement on' the .oppose fide
of the river, is altcgether without founua
t,'op. So 'far from military law being un
â¢ por-la#, I can sffure yon, that u a has
been fercctaitiied, it has been dor.s fit the vi
fpeeial inftar.ce and riqusft: of the irthsbi- b
tarits themselves;, I was witness inyTelf to ti
frequent solicitations from the moil refpec- it
table of" the inhabitants, earnestly re que ft- ti
ing the general to adopt the measure ; afid
a petition was actually in circulation before r<
t left that place,' ftjrit niÂ£ it sex pedietiii y arid b
urging its necrffity- It is pofliblc, how- t;
ever, that there may have been Come who n
were opposed t\> the nieaftire ; yet it is not ti
to be Wondered at, if, in theft, days of re- t :
generation, there are to be found there, as f<
well as here, pevfons who are opposed to g
all government. â¢ t
The sffertiofl, thr.t many of the inhabit- h
antshad, in conference of martial law, form- 1:
ed a new settlement ou the BritiiTi fide of
the strait is equally untrue. In confcquence
of the trtaty bet ween us and Great-Britain, f
eighty-four of the inhabitants of D'Etroit, f
agreeably to that treaty, declared ihemfelres f
British fuhjeelsâfhortiy after its ratificati J I
on they formetL the plan of the new fettle- c
ment-above alluded to. In the latter et>4 ot :
August, the / laid out the town on the op- c
polite fide ofthe Strait, about two miles be- i
Jovv D'Etroit ; and on the 4th July last, the i
proprietors call lots for their several places, t
and aÂ£tually commerrcedtheir improvements. c
The frame's of several dwelling houses, as c
well as of a Block house, were befote this :
framed, and ftigulated to be raised in a (hort j t
time.â It is therefore not only a falfe, but '
a cruel assertion, that it was in confcquence '
of the general's inhabitants /
of D'Etroit formed this new settlement
within the Britilh, lines. 1
Among the-Â».nany reasons that were urged <
in favor of' military law, it was alledged,
that in eonfequence of the sudden change 1
from a rigid and military discipline, to a mild
and lenient eiril administration, crimes of
every species had ertcreafed to_ fueh adegree,
that there was no security of persons or pro
perty. âThat by reason of forae ridical de
fe&.in the, new system, or in consequence
of the remiffnefs of the officers, there wes
no adequate remedy }o redress the grievances
complained of. That on account of the
prejudices of many in favor of foreign gov- . 1
ernments and their enmity to their new qne,
added to thelarge assemblage of IndiaS-i that
were continually gathered round the towÂ»,
and frequently in it, who in eonteauencs of
the secret mitigations ofthe Frenchand Spa- i,
nifti had discovered enmity towards the A
mericans,, the town was in real danger, of
being plundered and pillagedâto prevent j
whjch military law was the only remedy, as
the civil could not exclude the ladian3 from
the town, nor prevent their affeniblage out
of it.âBut many even preferred the milita
ry to the civil law from principleâit was a
government they had ever been accustomed
to; under which they aliedged they experi
enced fewer crimes, than under their new
government. Their disputes they urged
were then quicker fettled, with less expeuce,
and generally agreeable to right and justice.
It wai also formally stated to the general,
by Col. Hamtramck the then commandant
of the Post, that under the present law his
garrifop was daily dimini/hing by desertion
being enticed away by the inhabitants.â
That frequent complaints were made of the
excesses which they committed in .town,
which it was impossible for him to prevent
while the inhabitants were permitted to fell
them liquor; an evil the civil law wus ina- 1
dequatc to remedyâthat they were in real
danger of an attack and in cafe of an attack,
of a defeat by the Indians, as there were .
frequently five or fix hundred of them in â¢
the town many of whom had discovered hof-1
tile difpolitions, and who might, ealily un-:
der the present regulations, intoxicate his
garrison and render them an easy prey to
their mereilefs enemies.âln (hort he ailed- (
ged, that military law was the only method
of preventing the threatened danger and re
dressing the cu:iy evils complained of.
Difpatche's containing these statements
were, on the 7th of July last, forwarded by
the General to'the government, and request
ing orderi on the fubjedt:âlt is therefore
presumable that iflie has proclaimed milita
ry law, he hat not diine.it prematurely, nor
without orders. Before the measure is cen
sured, the above circumstances ought to be
known, and it is believed, thjit when weigh,
cd maturely, they will be fvund fufficient
juftificfitron of its adoption.

Translated for this Gaitette, from a work
entitled " An Eleftor of Paris/' written
and "published at Paris, by COWSIN
JACQUES ; author of several elegant
and much admired prodiiftions on religi
ous, moral, political and fanciful fubjef-ts,
page'l6l. This work is universally and
highly eftcemed and fought after by all
ranks of people, not only at Paris, but in
: the departments.
1 " What do you call RoValift ?
1 " Do you who regret the an
cient regimen ? But, with the exception of
. an handful of anarchiils, interested in the
i prolongation of the revolutionary goyern
. ment, every Frenchman regrets the ancient
order of things. It woujd be ufclefs to dif
, guise any longer this truth, founded in na
s ture atid reason."
" It is, in effeft, very natural and rea
i fonable, to compare the situation in which
â¢ we were, with that in which we are. There
â¢ ts not a iingle honcft man iu France who
docs not make this companion each moment
I in the dayâwho is not by an irrefiftiblc
; movement forced to maVe it, even when ha
yvifhes it suppressed. Before the revolution
there weie abusesâgreat abuses ; and the
â  revolution was made to correct those abr.fes ;
to-dÂ»y abuses of every kind are multiplied
; without end. The film which bear
' upon us at present is such, that nothing
[ which eppreffed men under the ancient re
; gimen, is comparable to cur actual situation.
. Every kind of- privation, vexation and calfi
. ttiity desolate us; we cannot make one ftepj
s ] walking on ruius or dead bodies ;
â¢ V \
We cannot look aActtai! Â«.?Â» without feeing ir
blÂ«od or tears. A'flu redly, this fltuation is v.
not eonfoling ; and to force men to prefer o
it to the ancient order of things, would, be tl
to fay to them : Â»
" We command you to prefer iniquity to si
religious fentituents, crime to virtue, rob- c
bery to honor, pirfidy to good faith, devaf- a
tation and pillage to tranquility and the i
maintenance of property, misery and famine \
to abundance and physical enjoyments, eveiy c
thing that defoTates to every thing that con- c
soles, alitlnVis sbfu'rd, over-dene, extrava- v
gant, perplexing, tyrannical and murderous, f
to all that is jufl, reasonable, confident, mild, \
humane, propitious to innocenre and favora- v
hie to pre'f.rvatidiii" ,
" Who further do you call Royalist,?" i
" Is it the mart of information, the re> J
fleiTting obferverj wiio,. judging of .the pre- <
sent by. pa ft ages, and. feeing faftions -rncef- v
fantly fuceeeding eaÂ«h other, (liould fay to
Jiimfelf: â" If the prtfont regimen engen- <
dcrs'faftions ; if it is in its essence to create <
-them ; if we march without ceasing from I
convulsion to convullion ; if parties succeed- !
ing and destroying each other by turfis, find 1
, in this order of things an eternal aliaieut to
their fury ; it would then be better to be un
der a chief, than to be in a republic ; be
cause a chief is the only means of fuppr&ing
all factions ; because factious rend and dif
traA the bosom of the country, and leeauje
tht people would never he Jmppy m a country al
ways tt prey to patricidal children who tear her
to pieces." ' (
â¢' But a man who reasons thus would me
rit a civic crown, in Head of deferring perfer
cut ion, becauf/he would be E&uated by a
sacred love of his couhtry, and love of coun
try is what constitutes the good citizen."
REMARKS. â¢
Friends to liberty, wherever ycrti are, fe
| tioufly weigh the above fctitimentsâthey
j were written by a man whom you will fee,
. by the quotation bel-w, was once an ardent
advocate for the revolution, which has taken
â¢ plaÂ«e in his courjtry. How much morerea
fon, Amtricr.ns-Trjr.y countrymen âhad a
frenchman, who lived under tsie despotism
. of the Grand-Monarque, to wi(h a change
in government than you, who in this land
of liberty, enjoy .every right compatible
v. ith the exigence of social order ? Do not, ,
my fellow-citizens, by complaining of ima
| gitiary, bring upon ypurfelves real oppression.
If you love and with toprelerve liberty, fol
low not blindly the devotees to Franceâ
, they will lead you into the paths qi despo
tism, through their zdtniration of every
thing that is French ; for it mud be evident
to every man of the lead penetration, that
the too long continued and.mnrderous anar
thy which dcfolates France," has opeued the
docÂ«s of despotism, which the people of that
unhappy country will soon eagerly rush iÃto,
to fhdter themselves from a more devasta
ting tornado. Consider the excellence of
your govcrnmeptâ-the invaluable privileges
you poffefgâthe benevolent and rational
laws that have been made to feeuje you in
the unmolested enjoyment of your particular
mode of* religious worship, your property
and reputation. Will you facrifice the cer
tam enjoypicnt of all tbpfe bleHings in the
chimerical hop " of eftaljlilhing a better and
more eligible order of things ? No, the bulk
of you are too enlightened not to fee, and
too honed not to defpifeauy attempts at in
< novation under the specious and
pretexts of exclusive and superior patriotism
and benevolence : a friend to mankind, I
love regulated, rational liberty as the true
source ps human felicity : and view as my
greatest enemy and the decided foe to the
â  t happiuefs of his fe.iow-creatures, him, who,
' continually at. work to undermine thepillari

" The cmtfe of these proceedings utn the

be attributed to the general alarm Sahi dis
quietude, which for some months pf>V*, have
taken possession of allperfons, has fvc Tcecded
the profound tranquillity that reigned,', and
the general confidence which every wltcri*
prevailed- It is to be attributed to rhe de-V.
falcation of the revenue, w-hich leaves all
parts of the administration in the most de
plorable situation, and deprives, often of
their pay and their subsistence those insn,
who, for years past, have facrificcd their
health and Ihed their blood t'Â»- ferÂ»e the re

nafion if the purchasers of the national property,
of the public functionaries, of fhÂ« defenders
of the countryâin short, of all those tvbo

New-Tori, October 9, '97. !
His excellency the President of the U- |
nited States being hourly expeft'ed in town
from the eastern states, on his way to Phi
ladelphia, brig. gen. Hughes calls on the
companies of grenadiers and in
fantry of the different" battalions of the
brigade, and the companies of horse, to
afierable (at the iignal of the troop beating
through tht ftrecis) in Broad Way, oppo- ;
lite to Trinity church, in order to pay him
clue honors on his arrival. They will be
%j,fter the pommand of col. Morton, aflifted
by major BogerH-The adjutant will come
from the 3d regiment. 1
Col. Morton, on the arrival of the troops
of horse on thi ground, will instantly de
tsch them to gen. Hughes' quarters, at
Hunter's hotel, there to wait his orders. , .
CtfpU Ten Eyck, of the brigade artillery ( I
will, at the above mentioned signal, affcm- |
ble his company at the battery, and fire a :
. federal salute, on notice being given him
of the president's arrival, and do the other
lifual honours. Col. Morton will proceed
with the reft of the troops, as shall be com
municated to him by the brigadier general.
Those officers of the brigade, not de
tached on particular ferriee, who make
it convenient to assemble, mounted, will be
-very acceptable to the brigadier general, on
hi? route to meet the President.
By order,
John Morton, Maj. of Brig.
It having been determined by a large
iiurtiber of eirizens to give an entertainment,
at the city hotel, to the President of the
United States on his arrival in this city
(which is daily expected) the committee of
arrangement have fignified to the 1 major of
brigade, that it would be a desirable cir- â 
cumftance to be joined, in this attention to '
the chief magistrate of our nation, by the
officers of the brigade. For this purpose, '
therefore, fubfeription papers will be open- j
ed by the major of brigade, and left with .
the adjutants of the different regiments ;
and also at his offict, where the adjut'tots I
will be supplied with tickets of admission. i
â  N. B. Notice will be given of the day ,
fixed for the entertainment. r

'' Permit ns to addrefsiyou nt this awful
crisis, and lay before you a brief statement
Ir.n of the diftrefllrtg situation of our fuffertog
fellow-citizens. It in known to you that
on the firft day of September we accepted
of the appointment fr.,m the governor, to
aft as commissioners for the purpose of re
lieung the indigent, by donation and em
ployment, with the ftipuhtcd sum often
thousand dollars, granted by the Icgiflature ;
and we presume it was generally believed at
that time to be more- than fufficient, arising
from an expectation that the disease would
soon abate, and that our abftnt friends
would return and give employment to those
b-r, whose refouroes were cut off by their leav- 1
ing the city ; but, alas ! how are we dif- 1
appointed in our expeftation, for our Â«ity )
>me yet continues in the fame desolated gloomy t
der state, and consequently all means of employ- c
â r'u mentfor the industrious mechanic and la- t
vn. bourer are still suspendedâAdd to this the r
irf- numerous body of-females that procured a J
bat livelihood by waftu'ng, ironing, needle work, 1
ad &c. who are left destitute of their usual J,
pn means of subsistence, besides a number who '
*>on are aged and infirm, that used to obtain re
il, lief from the bounty of their more able
m- friends and relations, as well as many sea
men s wives who depend on the merchant J
part of their husband's monthly pay, and I
who are now deprived of relief from that si
Its, source. In this deplorable situation we d
1 < found not less than three thousand people, d
inclnding children, when we undertook to f:
tu . execute the trust reposed in us, the numb*r si
la - of these have since greatly increased, and la
â 'T they still remain in the fame fuffering con- 2
: ' y f dition, with this difference, then they had b;
