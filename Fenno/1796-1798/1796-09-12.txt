A very valuable Merchant Mill,
' A DISTILLERY andfundrySTONE
" 1\ QUARRIES to be let ,
I will rent my merchant Mj'l at the little Falls of Po -
towmac, iFor any term not lsli than seven, nor more than h
eleven years, from the-firft day of September ner.t. The' fe
mill-house is 42 by 40 feet, three stories high, 'ouik with c c
store, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Si >nes, two k
[. overfiiot 18 feet wat.r whe;!s, and Evans's machinery cl
e complete, with every other thing proper and nereffary for ir
carrying on the business with dispatch, and at as little ex- le
penle as possible, *11 in good order.âFrom the mill to my 'â¢
landing on the Potomac river, (wherecraft, of aiiy bur
then muy deliver grain and take in'flour) it is about
yards, and from thence by water to George-Town anil
the City of Wafllington, about % njiles, and to Alexan
dria about Ii miles. This situation, aided by a fufficii-nt
capital, will command the produce of a very cXtenfivc
"back country, whÂ»re large quantities of whsat ami other
grain is annually made, the distance to it b?inÂ£ from 8
to 10 miles less than to any market town up -n the navi
gation of the PotOwmac. There are on the premises a
large stone Coopers' (hap, a stone granary, and a commo
dious miller's house. At the landing'aforefaid a bridje
is now huilding nvcr the Potomac, which is in great forf 0
wardnt/s and probably will be Eniihed the ensuing fall. a
There are also on the prtmifes, a Brewery and Diftille- p
rv, built with stone, in them are three Hills, two coppers
or boilers, with'cverv necessary rrticlc, all new, and in k
good order, and fufficiently large to carry cn the Brew- o
ery and Distillery upon a very cxtenfive plan. This prop- ti
erty I will rent for the lame term of yqars. F
Upon my lauds adjoining the premises, apd along the
banks of the river, where craft may lead with ease and dis
patch, is an i rimenfe q lantity of building and founda
tion-ftones. Four quarries are now open, and as many
I*'1 *' more may be opened with ease : the ftoae taken-from these
quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries
_ separately or tog ther as may best suit.
On the top of the hill, and about 200 yards from the
mill, is a stone Dwelling-house, large enough for the ac
m coir.medation of a family : also, a kitchen, dairy, smoke
house, &c. and a garden, enclosed and in cultivation, the
foiof which is equal in goodness to any in this state. I
h, will also rent this property.
ds Adjoining to the Brewery and Distillery is a Smith's
(hop, in which is a complete set of Blackfinith's tools,
1 which I will also rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
s: tenant two negro blackfrnitns, one of them is a, complete 5
'5 workman.
"S If I rent nut the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts,
which were built for the purpose of carrying Sone : they
in will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch. Immediate '
poffefficn will be given. For terms apply to the fablcnb- \
ed er in this town.
n- The Mill, Brewery and Distillery, with their appurtcn- J
to ancej, will be deliVerad to the tenant or tenants ih good ]
in repair, and muftbe so returned, at the expiration of the j

The Duke de*Crillon Mahon, Captain-Genera!
of the armies, died here lass month, at the age of
_ So. It is calculated, that he has been in- 68 dif
ferent engagements.
le It is extraordinary that thÂ» public papers have
he not sooner announced this loss which Spain has fuf.
tained. The DuKe de Crillon, of a'l their Gene
rals, commanded the Spanim armies with ths great

IE It was he who in that war took the island of Mi
norca, from England. After having served long
in France, his native couÃtry, at the conclusion of
the seven years war, he pafTcd with the approbation
of "the French government into the service of Spain,
where he acquired the firft military rank. Not
having taken any part in the lad war of the Spa
niards a?ainft the French, he had a very a&ive

The title of Duke of Mahon, destined to per
petuatethe remembrance of his vrftories, has pas
sed to the youngest Â»f his sons by a third marriage.
The two eldest sons of the Duke de CriÃon, have
a title more precious in th< eyes of their country,

their glotj ip the facrifices which liberty demanded
of them. Great diftin&ions awaited them, had
they wilhed to leave their country j but they -pre
ferred the honor -of remaining French- ritizens.
Even persecution, which they did not efeape, has
not weakened their conflancy. This example of
devotion to the republic, far exceeds the palriotifm
of who boast of their disinterestedness, while
the revolution has been to them a mine of gold, or
who have seta high price upon very trifling services.

General Buonaparte is, it is, said, gone to Paris,
to confer personally with the Dire&ory, and receive
new inftruftions for his future operations. He is
ejtpefted to return within a fortnight. Citizen,
Pinfot has been appointed commifTary of the French
. army in the room of Salicetti.
On the 12th three deputies set out from this city
to Pan's, to notily to the French government the
wish of the inhabitants of Milan, that the Milanese
1 and the reft of Lombardy may be changed into a
republic. >
When the deputies were about to depart, a great
multitude of people was afTembled. The president
of the munii ipality made a discourse to them, in
which he said, " that all the municipalitieÂ», legally
affetabled, had expressed their wish that the country
might be changed into a republic.'?- One of the
deputies replied, and aflure'd the president, that he
would exei t himfelf to the utmost in the execution
of his mission, that the people might be gratified in
their wi(h for republican liberty. Another of the
deputies (Serbelloni) at his departure, took off the
key he wore as chamberlain, and declared that as
he wa4 now a freeman,, he would no longer wear
the badge of slavery.
The new French CommifTary, Pinfot, has order
ed that all persons who are indebted to the Auftit
an government, the Archduke Ferdinand, the Emi
grants or the powers at war with France, shall give
them in, tinder pain of paying double ; all feudal!
rights, exclusive rights of the chace, all armorial
bearings and liveries, are abolished. All diplomas
of nobility are to be given in, within a'week, and
burnt.. "No person is tÂ« bear any other title, except
profefiional, than that of citizen. Inventories are

LONDON, July 5. 1
, The fcherae of operations of the French Armies '
is not fufficiently understood in this Country to ena- f
ble us to form a proper estimate of its merits. Mi- !'
litary men who know \he country, however, speak 1
of it \Vith the highest commendation. They fay
it is a plan conceived with equal enterprize and c
still: it defeats every project that the Auftrians
formed for the campaign ; since if Prince Charles *
fttould detach from his army a body oT men fuffi- '
cient to Wurffifcr to attack Moreau, he v
must expose the important line of the river Main to 1
Jourdan, who would afTuredly again cross" the ''
Rhine : and even sn attack by Wnrmfer would not 0
be disastrous to Moreau, while the Ffench bavefe- u
cured the bridges for their retreat.
On the other hand, if piince Charles does not a
detach, it is likely that Morfcau will form a jundti- 3
on with Kellerman, who has hardly any thing to
oppose his pa (Tags by the Lake of Conltance, ex
cept the feebie garrisons of Landau and Bregenlz ;
and, this junflion once the Austrian armies
mult retreat fiom the Rhine to save the veiy heart P
of Germany.'
In the mean time, even if these grand projefls d
Should fail, the FVcgcb have succeeded in turning
the war into the enemy's country. The fertil? c l
fidee of the Brtfgaw not merely save their own a,
f crops, but deprive the Auftrians of their only near y
supplies, and force them tojliaw all their fubfjftence b
from the Mam and" Necker.

of the oppofers of the treaty; for it was unques
tionably brought forth and intended to be relied
upon by thtm. By it will be seen, that those
charged with seeking war, would in fa&, for peace
- fake, have probably vo'ed for the appropriation,
had the (late of our eomrcerce warranted it 5 but
â¢ with daily and aggravated impediments and spolia
tions before tfctir eyes, they were desirous to fuj
, fend appropriations until fatisfa&ion for pad, and
fecuri'ties against future injuries was obtained.
Mr. Dearborn, in fact, made even a motion to
agtee to the appropriations conditicnally, with a
reliance on the executive interference in behalf of
our commerce. Even this was denied, and thÂ«n
it was when the vote was forced unconditionally on
the membersâthat many voted against jt who
might have voted for it, had the proposed condi
tion of the vote been agreed to. A reference to
the debates, as'publifhed by Mr. Bache, will fully
prove ami explain this. As to the (hameful wffte
of time and public money iu cife lilting im
p'ortancp of the occasion certainly warranted Jhe
btdligation it met with, and impartial poftcfity j
will judge cf the force and wildc ni cf ' the argus
rtients adduced os en aef fide j but if too milch oub>
lie time hath beÂ»iÂ»-already fpetit about it, it WfÂ»uld t
perhaps be best, Mr. Fenno, not to' increaftr that f
evil by extending it. I
A. B. c
This is not the firft Instance, in which the 3
politeness and urbanity of this writer has fed him I
to stigmatize the Gazette of the United States, Â«
when he has seen proper to make it t!je vehicle of t
his remarks to the public. It may be true that this v
Gazette is aimoft the only one in this Gity, (and it '
is an honorable peculiarity) which contains obfer
various similar to those A. B. objects toâlt is not
however diilingtiifhcd for circulating those detesta
ble profluftions in which it is attempted to 1 degrade 1
f.* the American name and charafler" below those 1
of any other nation which ever ex'tt<"d. Nor is it
distinguished by a pretended Veneration for out re- (
publican government, and at the fame time reviling ,f
the majority #f the people. It is not diftinguifiled
by abufe'of the Government for not pursuing meat
fores that would involve the country in war, and at
the fame time deprecating war as the greatest of e
evils. What is the honorable chsratferiftic of (
other paper*printed in the city.âlÂ» the Philadel- 1
phia Gazette of Friday, there ic an article copied t
from the Kentucky Gazette, (which originally ap f
peaied in an paper,) and is as follows.ââ c
" LEXiNCTftN, Aliguft 6.
" If the French should fuccee*! in their negoci
ation with Spain, and obtain poffeflion Â»f Louisia
na, we shall be bound by a much stronger tie of in
terelt to observe a good undcrftanding with her go
vernment. The proximity of Gtuation will give
them greater opportunity of annoying us, fliould a
continued couife of unfriendly condudl towards
them render fifch a vefolution necelTary.âEvery '
American should be filled with corfufion at rtflee
ting on our deportment to this nation to whom we '
owe so much. Wliilft on the one hand,we have- '
meanly crouphed to Britain whenever (he pleased to '
adopt the stile of a braggadocia, we have behaved
to France.with an infalence aimoft incredibl*. It
is in vain that we seek for"tTie motives of this con
duct ; theyare hidden beyond the ken of the com
mon eye. Reason-, gratitude, justice, all oppose it:
the frie idfhip displayed by Britain could not allure
us 1 for (he has treated us in a manner so base that
the pirates of Algiers themfclves would blush to
avow ptaflices so contrary to the laws of nature and
nations. And yet we have tamely home it all !
" How natural-was the warm enthufiaitic ex- 1
preflions of Genet, when a manly indignation led
him to cryout, " if your ftllow-citizeYii have been
deceived, if you are not in a condition to maintain ]
the sovereignty iff the people, speak : we have 1
guaranteed ir when slaves ; Vfe know how to render I
it rt'fpe&able, having become free." If this lan- 1
guage was applicable when it was used, how mu*h
more so is it new.âTruly it appears that it is Wat
ter, it is Milk which creeps thtoiigh the veins of Â»
Americans." [Kentucky Gaz.J 1
That the abore is a falfe reprefentatron, so far as c
ij refpedls the Government' of the United States, '
and the people of this country, no one will denyâ 1
Is it not then an infamous attempt to degrade the
American name and character ? And tlio' this re
mavk may be confined to this Gazette only, it dc.cs
not follow, that the greater jufiice is done to the
people of the Unitrd StAÂ«'s, by not publrlhing si- -
milar remarks in any other paper of the city. It
is hoped A. B. will feel the propriety ot taking his
own hint at the conclufiori of his effsy. It v.ill
certainly be advantageous to the public if they
should be influenced by it or. a future occasion.

BY THIS DAY'S MAIL.
NEWBURYPORT, September 6.
STATE of HEALTH,
Monday Evening, September _j, *796.
Since our last publication-os the 3d inft. three per
sons only have died ot a malignant fever, and one
child ot a quincyânone have been tsker. lick with the â¢
above fever since last Thursday, and three only are
now fitk, and we havÂ« great real'on to hope from the
present appearances to be able to give a more favoura- '
blc account of the disorder.
By the Committee of Health,
Captain Lunt, arrived yesterday in 13 .days from
Gnidaloupe, informs, that the plague had broke out 1
3t St. Thomas's, which carries off numbers daily.
SALEM, (Mass) September 6.
By the best accounts we can obtain refpefling the '
fever at Npwhury Port, it appears th t Capt, Mul- :'
berry arrived at that port from Jamaica, the 31ft of j
May, and loft two of his men on his homeward i I
passage, by the fever prevalent in Jamaica. On the
Ift of June he discharged his cargo, which was rum, (
at a wharf near to a place in which the offals of fifh, j ;
in a highly putrid state, had been laid for the pur
pose of manure. On the 15th of June, the health i
Committee begun the lift of deaths from the fever, .
which has prevailed only ; upon this spot. It has
continued in this place to the present time, apd 26
pfrfons have died, either upon this spot, of after
having been refideftt upon itâ-15 of each sex, of'
the following ages, none below 12 years of age, 6
between 12 and 20 years, 6 between 26 and 30, 5
between.' 30 and 40, 4 between 40 and 50, 1 be
tween 50 and 60, and 4 between 60 and 70. The
physicians have not yet reported to the public the
charafler arid treatment of the fever, Do&. Swett :
died on the 16th of August, with the symptoms of
the yellrfw fever after 4 days illness. He had no
success while he attended the fever. By some, the
fever has been called the jail, and by others the yel
low' fever. The patients are seized with delirium, <
with vomiting, and with drowfinefg. The Do&or t
was seized witlvvotijiting, and inftantlv pronounced 1
upon his owji fate. Upon inquiry from the Health '
Committee, and from reports of the physicians I
inhabitants, it is generally attributed to the putrid
fifh, which has not been removed, but coverpd up. I
It isfaidno persons have fuffered who had connec
j ".ions with the vessel, if thev have net lived Or eon
| tifiUeirear the putrid ftlh. " Â»
' ' ...
The fever lias not been so (uglily contapious aa
to have been conveyed from this spot. The per- t!
tons who have fur various purpofesattended the lick,
have all escaped. Only $ were reported 00 Satur- C
day a/ fickby the Health Ccramittee. Great con- I
Iternation has been difcovertd by the i:,Â«abitants ; f
and many have removed. Water ftrect has been b
(hat Up, but the fever certainly haunts the spot in â¢ 1.
which the filth was laid, and is in 110 other part os l o
the town. The late tains give usreafon to hope, k
with, other ci'rcumftam es, that it will foot) cease.-â tl

By Capt. Plummer, from Cette, Barcelona and ! a ,
Gibraltar, we have much the la;eft'news from the

At Barcelona, July if, the following was given 0
by a gentleman as the current news of the place.
" We had an account yesterday, that an event,
expefteJ For so one time pail, had at length taken Â®
place, namely, the occupation of Leghorn by the
French. About Joo irten, chiefly cavalry, having p
come to Piftoya, and on thy road towards Sienna, 0
struck down suddenly on the morning of the 27th
of June, and tookpoffeffion of Leghorn, evident
ly with the expectation of furpiifing the Englifli, Â®
and plutdering their property. Aa the Englifli
were, hewever, appriled of their visit, every thing

the <ffets and furniture of Twenty
three fqtare rigged veflels, with fixteeh Tartans, 1
! laden, f;iled out of the harbor the morning that
tire enenly entered the town. The news that we
