Mr
AMIDST the mass of intelligence re
ceived by the recent arrivals from Europe,
~ there are t<o or three articles, though of a
trifling ind personal nature, wiiich havecon
ftderabiy excited my aftonifhmentl allude
, lo those which announce the appeaiance in
t.J Paris, of the famous Polijh General; his
sentiments with regard to the American go
ks. vernraent and its admim'ftratcrs, and his ex- I
traordinary connedtions with the powers that
be in France.
During his late residence in America, lie
id- ex^l^l " a F'&ure which seemed more to
call for commiseration, than to awaken fuf- '
picion or apprehenfiun. Mangled, weak
Afd emaciated, he was confined to his room;
enjoying of life no oiher pleasure than what
was administered by the friendly society of N
those who either through pity or curiolity, 1
visited him. Even in this confinament,
I however, he probacy experienced the high j
i happiness of which hiÂ» pride was fufcep
tib'e, being politely attended by every dif- \
tinguifhed Member of the Federal Govern
n, ment; by molt of the ladies as well as '
ed tlemen of this city and New-York. This 3
Â£ view of his fituftior, contribu ed, no doubt, C
u to accelerate the pecuniufy grant which Con-
grefs, during that session. made him in con- t
fideration of his services in our revolution
in Willing to attribute to all men the faireft C
le motives for their conduft, 1 at that time,
a- disregarded the fufpici ns which were often Â°
e, l.i'ted at his intentions; believing <liat he '
V had returned hither to enjoy in peace, the Â°
decaying remnant of a life glorionfly devoted ,
â 8 to danger, in the cause of liberty. In this
I was further confirmed, by frequently hear- r
iog him exprcts sentiments of regard for the !
American government, and a veneration for ,
if' the ll'uftrious charaders who conduaed it. V
; s Hence has proceeded my astonishment and
:- indignation!â Hence I cannot priflibly give Â°
credit to the articles above alluded 1 to, with o
- out assigning to the conduft of the illuf
i- trious General, the odium of the fouled dti-
i. plicity as well as the bhekeft ingfatitu ie.â
e Painful as it is to concur in this femur Â°
. there are many circumftai ces which up
, recolledlion, arise in confirmation of tbe dif- '
graceful charge. Thcf I (hall freely com- 3
municate t my country, h pingthereby to

he may betern.d) Â«er< t!,e Hon. T. Jef

honorably distinguish themselves in tradac- l
, >ng: the government of the United States, 1
and in extolling the comlu& of the imn:acu- a '
late Direftory of France H Logan, aa is â¢
hinted m one of the articles referred to
above, in going to France, did no doubt W
' follow the advice of Kofciufko ; having had
isveral long conferences with liim. tbe few j"
; days preceding his departure.* Jefferfon's c
connexion with him was as fingtil r, as I
fear, it will prove difgraceful. Tfic Gene- "i
ral had repeatedly given out, that
posed visiting Virginia to take the benefit
; the baths. On the night of the 4th 0/
May, after a hafly vilit from the vice-Pre.
. Went, his baggage was ordered to be packed
up, "and early next morning, accompanied pr
by his Excellency, (who, by the bye, at that ga
time, was deserting his duty in the Senate) ro
departed in % close coach, for (as was sup elj
posed) Virginia. Of the former, nothing â¢pe
had been heard until - it was known be was ca
in France ! What may add perhaps, to the Fi
occafioned by this develope- wi
ment, is, that he was net attended thither ga
by his very courteous and distinguished com- ey
panion!
In the fame gallican articles he is repre- th
fented as having a fettled disgust for the A
merican government and its griateft orna- foi
ments : this disgust was so feverJy pointed gu
at President Adams aud General Washing- tai
ton, as to induce him to refufe a vilit from Fe
either! Wonderful indeed!â His not re- th
ceiving a visit from these diftinguilhed cl a- g U
rafters however is ow ing to far other motives an
than his own aversion; the former never be- ess
ing deli rows of such a gratification, and the am
latter, being at Moi:nt Vtrnon, would not I g U
am sure, undertake a journ y co behold the go
Ihattered rcmaants of G neraT so much his mc
inferior both in vim \i i hqneft fame ! ret

Thus it is perceived that after coming to fro
this country, and by a shew of I am alrooft t uc
tempted to fay, unreal misery, exciting from cat
our government a liberal mark of its muni- to
ficence, he has returned so Europe, and ear
ly commenced the honest work ofcalumnia- Th
ting his benef.iQcrs t Thus it is evident that th<
while enjoying the honours which our wor- rei
thieft citizens heaped upon him, he was col- dei
leagueing with the direst enemies of our Ch
peace ; by his councils afli.iing incendiaries, am
'and by his influence encouraging treason! th;
And thus may we behold in a charafter that ,me

â¢ f - ENVOY LOGAN.
<-' dÃy extraas from Paris papers, nojy
sd printed in America, it appears that Dr. Lo
ut gan has drawn to himfelf the eyes of Eu
r) rope and America. When he left Philad
p- elphia. there were many jull causes to fuf
ig â  pea that he was sent to France on a politi
as cal million, iri the charaaer of agent for the
ie French faaion in '.he United States, Who
e- will doubt it, when he knows that Dr. Lo
er gan has had frequent conferences with Tal
n- eyrand, the minister of foreign affairs, and
has been honourably entertained by Merlin,
e- the President of the Direflory.
It was long ago afceitained, andhas been
a- for some time generally believed, that a re
gular intercourse was kept up between cer
-- tain leaders of the opposition party to the
m Federal government, and the condndlors of
e- the Fresch RepublicâThat there was a re
a- gular co operation of the French faaion here
ess and the French rulers there, to deilroy and
e- effcntially change the present conftitutiou,
â¢e and to put the affairs of America under the
I guidance of men devoted to France. Can
Â»e (Â«w any per/on whatever, who has given the
is moil cursory attention to political occur
' rentes, helitate to believe that fnch a faction
f- has txifted, and at this moment that thei?~
chief is usurping the executive powers of the
t, nation. We are informed under the Paria,
head of news, that Dr. Logan is an envoy
0 from the Americans who avow their grat -
ft tudeand friendfliip to France ; and that h#
m carried with him letters from T. Jefferfon
to Merhu or Talleyrand.
1 - Netd it be asked by what authority has
a- 1 homas JefFerfon presumed to interfere in.

T,
:e From tbe " Ami des Lais" of tbe second Frut- '
o- tidor, printed at Paris, <we bave extracted
tbe foUt'iving :
11'. " Since the last inteHigence from Philadelphia
n _ the Congress of tha United States li<.ve adopted
ft a motion of citizen Otis, of Boston, winch
imports, in fubftar.ee, " that all
y who may be obliged to qsit the country 'hall
1* hA' e permlfTion to take such or their effefts a
:r they may conveniently carry a-.vay, and thai
ig whatever remains, (ball he a lubjefl to t.'oeir cr
rl. der after their departure."
e _ And we are well atTured, that this tiberil and
judicious provifton had a great influence in ob
taining a repeal of the erabirgo 011 A.nerican
Jr vcffels.
:e
h We have good authority to conclud-,
That the Difpatehes w iich werÂ£ brought
by Mr. Woodward, and immediately sent
| to the President, contain nothing more than
an official com nur.ication to : vir. Skipwith
' of the lite Arretes taking off the Embargo
v on our veiTels and enjoining tbe libei atior,
x " ! of American fiilors, with a copy of new
Orders to the Commanding Officers in tEe
ports of the Republic, dire&ing ihem to
treat our veiTels as they treat other neatrnls,
o- notwithstanding- the late atSs of our Go
vernment.
| But with all these fair appellees, the
S laivs, which authorize the capture of our
; vessels and property, are not yet repealed ;
'j. i though we learn, it is Mr. Skipwirli's opi
nion that the Directory wiil recommend to
'1 tiic two Council* a revision and modification
ofthofelaws, and we may presume that
13 the two Councils will continue to do as they
'â¢ are bidden,
n
Letters from gentlemen of the firfl isfir
-0 ma:ion, and of different political principles
in Paris, to others in this town, ail concur
in dating that the rigorous and decide*'* con
duft of our Government, and the appear
ance of unanimity in the addresses 'of the
j' people, have produced a strong fesjfat'.ou
1 throughout France, and to these fnzr.i.
" we are indebted for any apparent chv 1

j It is confidently said, and we n,
doubt of the fadl, that the king of N
f has made a treaty with the king of Gre .â 
Britain, granting proteftion to Britilh ih. j
1 and property, and that the Emperor ie
s agreed in cafe the French oppose thistle::
ty, to support the king of Naples. >
The French hÂ»ve loft the esteem and
friendlhip of all the jacobins in Europe, in
Hamburg, and other neutral countries, the
jacobin papers have changed their complex
ion. In the " Speiflateur du Nord," a
Hamburgh paper, there is a dialogue be
tween Robefpiere 3tid Cromwell in which
their aspiring ambition and dangerous prin
ciples, are exposed with great wit and pro
priety.â A few American jacobins only still
hold out.
Tlie difpatchts from our Envoys were
' published o-dy in one department in France;
> a few copies only found their way to the
' light. They wctj immediately suppressed
by order of government. Thus (lands the
French liberty of the press.
Our Jacobins pretÂ«nd that the late change
of the m afures us the French dire&ory
mud be imputed to Lagan, their private a
ge:,t ; but the fact is, that all tbe favora
ble arretts were passed ten days before /.s

A very sagacious Correspondent of
Mr. Cobhett's (in a witty vein) aftects to
; have found out, that 99 is an hundred ;
or ig other words " that the moment
we ended counting 1797, there were
' 1798 years part." This witty gentle
a man] too, broaches this humorous dif
eovery, after having accused his oppo- 1
nent of vanity and tgniraucf!
As he concludes by informing us that
a Lawyer and a 'Judge, (alias two Law

â¢ Two young Widows have just com

ing at the. abolition of an horrid and
cruel cuftotn of Italy, by the power of
rrench influence. As the world natural
ly lets it down, from the peculiarity of the
circumstance, for a charaEieric trait, one
cannot too much admire at the bungling
itupidity of the loggerheaded boobies,
who under the fÂ«iÂ£tion of those ladies'
names, have committed this intolerable
faux pas.
During the performance of Lear at a
minor theatre, which had been raised on
the ruins of a boat-builder's shop, a hid
den rife of tfe tide actually overflowed
the pit, and expelled the gaping crowd,
to the great chagrin of the wonder-work- i
-iig actor, who, bent on fixing his audi
ence, and not observing the Jlimulant to
motion, still kept vociferating "Ye ca- -
tracts and hurricanoes spout, till ye have
drencht out steeples, drown'd the cocks,"
thereby greatly adding to the horrors !
of the audience, who now began to think
the whole a contrived scheme for their '
deftructton. ,

" On the 22d of Anguft,-lat. 33, I had
very heavy gaits, of wind : it blew with such
violence, and heavy sea going, I was fear

;ir at that moment we received a whole broad

For Insurance against FwÂ», on Dwelling- j n
Houses, Ware-Houses, and other Buildings (and
on Goods contained in such Buildings) distant from j n
Philadelphia, in the Uuitcd States. j t
â  1 Q
I Common lufurancet, on hazards of the firft
class, will be undertaken at a premium of ahout Jv
hall per cm. per annum. For extra Hazardous
rifques a larger premium will be required, which
will vaty according to circutiftances, feldam ex- '
leeding oa.- per cent, per annum ; but io some in- Â°'
fiances, where the property ir.fured is not only in
itfelf extra hazardous, but rendered flill more so tl
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and to
occupations, the premium demanded will be raised m
according to drcumflances. di
Houses and Ware<Houfes, the walls and pcrti- tk
tions of which afe wholly of stone or l>rick, well bi
conftruiled, so at to be guarded as well as may be
again!! fires from wrfhin, and free l'rom extra ha
zardous buildings and occupations in their neigh- Q
borhood, will be doomed hazardous of the firft
class, a"d may be insured to their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not o' an extra
hazardous kind, in casks. bales, or packages, Ae
pofited in such h uildhigs, to an amount rot ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; but if more than thisfnm â¢Â«
is required to be.insured in one tenement, an addi~
tioaal premium will be required, in proportion to f(
sircurnftances. [ a
1!. Insurances will also he made on buildings aad p
good* extÂ»a hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to thfl rifoue. Eut it is Hot easy to arrange tb-.fe
uiu'er particular funide ( r clafTes, so as to describe
each with tl>e necessary accuracy. Each cafe mufl
therefore be decided upon according to the circum
fiances a-tending it; and these circumftanccs wifi,
in general, appear from the defcripticn aceompa
uyibg theapplication.
Building" partly conftruiled of brick or none, N
are pveferablc to those wholly wooder. And in
both cases, the stile of buils'inj, how they are oc
cvpied, how they are fituitcd, the neighboring
buildings, andhow areconflderatiocs to
be taken into view. And with refficit te goods,
their tendency, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, ether
to commence or to increase an accidental fire, aÂ«d
their liability in such state lo receive damage by fy
wet, or by sudden and ha(ly removal, or to he fto- 0 ]
leu in time of confufion and hurry, are all dr- e .
cumftances of weight; and the premiums mufl be . e
proportioned accordingly. ] ]

2.!. Insurance* naay be renewed at the rxpira- P*
tion of the tern) of the policy, without further ex- >*
penfesthan the payment of the premium of the re
newed term, the circumftanccs continuing the fame
as they were uhderftood by the Insurers at the time
the former insurance wss made ; but the payment
of the | remiuni is essential tÂ® such renewal ; and q
if the party infu*edfuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he r
pays 3 ; refnium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; Bor can the insurance be renew- â 
e.l en the forfner policy but by computing the *
commencement of the renewal frem the expiration
o[ the former insurance. The fubjeA of infur- Â°
ance may neverthelefe be open to treaty for a new le
insurance.

1 Onondago.a nd state of New-York, on the Banks (
of the SenecÂ»-riVer, two miles weft of the Cayuga- j
v ferry, and eleven miles east of Geneva. ,
This ellabli'hment consists of Â»n excellent grift
e mill, saw mill, dwelling house, bars, and a port
,f age or carrying place, with between thirty and
forty acres of land, under good improvement, and
as much more in the jrtciility, as maybe required i
for future improvement, t
l The grift mill is a handsome, new and well fin ' 1
ifhed building, of jo by 30 feet, 3 stories high
and furnifhed with a run of excellent Burr stones
and another Â®f ftopus' stones, of the bell quality '
- âand the mod approved boalts, &c. calculated to i
make all the different qualfties of flour for sxpor-
' m tation or for hcmeconfumptton : It is acceflilile by
â water from every part c(f the Cayuga lake an 4 Se
neca-river, as well as fVotH the Seneca-lakeâand '
from its situation, commands a veryextenfivc and
_ encreafing caftom : The flream on which it stands,
. being the outlet of tjbe Seneca-lake, the mill cau i
g never be in want of water ; and as it has been kept
warking during the fevtrdl feafor. of the last w;n- ,
e ter, it is not liable to be impeded by froft :
The saw mill is also new, situated on the fame j
flream, now furnifhed with an ample flock of .
r logs, df which a fopply may at all times be pro- j
cured by lani or water, of the bed quality :
n The dwelling house is well calculated for the life
of the miller, is new, and fuf&ciently large : The
U barn is about 40 feet square, and entirely new :
r The portage is 3-4ths of a mile in length, along
the Sfcneca-fallsâover which were passed in the ,
1 last year, nearly two hundred boats with their |
[' contents ; this objeft is already produ&ive of a (
handsome income, which niuft be increasing and j
[j permanent:
Among the many advantages of thisfituation,
ts must be numbered the fertility of thefuri ounding
countryâbeing the btft improved part of the coun
,l ty of Onondagaâthe concentration of inter
e coarse by land and water, the Geneffee ftateroad
paDTing through it, as well as all water carriage to j
Geneva, and the counties a# Ontario and Steuben ; .
which renders it a mofl eligible fland for a Store or j
TavernâThe river and lakes abound in fifii and
Â® fowl, aud the country with deer and other game- .
Besides the mills already erefled at this place, it j
e is calculated for any additional water works that
1 1 maybe found neceflaryâFulling mill, baik mill '
' tannery, forges, &c. maybe ereited at a small ex- (
