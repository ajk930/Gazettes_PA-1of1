JÂ»R. TEKVft,
It is a'fad confirmed by daily experience,
that we have among us some chnrafters, so
abandoned to all sense of honor, so destitute 1
of that love'or country whioh nature has
implanted in the breads of all men, traitors â¢
excepted, as to eridraÂ«or to juitify the ont- 1
rages of the FvencK rulers upon the sacred '
rights of their own citizens and their wick
ed and unprovoked aggrcflions upon neutral 1
nations; by ransacking the records of etc- '
ry government from the creation of the world
prefent'day sos precedents. Theme- >
rit of this new dii'covery, thai ont immoral
aSion veil!cxtvfe another, is certainly due to
the French apologias, and fully accounts. â¢
fcr the mpny reccat violations' ef trad and
toufidencc of tvhich their moll zealous parti
sans have been guilty.
. during the firft years of the revolution
in France, our excltilive patfribts vindicated
the cruel and Unjust adÂ« of tfre French ru
lers, upon the ground of. thur being grand
originals in ihemfelves, and as such,
worthy of cbt imitation of all the surround
ing nations.âNÂ«vv forfootb, that we'arte
crime to our lcafes, and can no longer view
Frenchcrimesin the light of cardinal virtues,
our patriots have wheeledabout, anil plainly
tell us, the dire&ory import their habits of
perfidy and pillage from abroad! These are 1
precious confejions, from which a IdTon may
be drawn of the utmost importance to the
wtlfare of the human race; it is this, That
the French people,after having (lied torrents
of blood, after having laviihed mountains of
treasure, and endured years ps unspeakable
misery in pursuit of Liberty aud Equality,
are now groaning under the yoke of a gov
ernment, more sanguinary, mire immoral,
more faithlefs and more arbitrary than
ever existed before.
I have been led tb make these refleflions 1
by perilling" a series of publications in the
Aurora, under the signature of an American
Merchant/ .in which the conduct of the
French government towards this country, is
not only defended on the principle of pre
cedent;, but a number of Jesuitical argu
ments are adduced to shew, that the result
will be rather beneficial to U3 than other
wise. It is not my intention to notice all
the filly ideas, which this tirrfeme writer
ha: broached ; : t would be apiece of drudgery
. to which my icifure is not competent: bet
as his object is ta reconcile the people of the
United States to the late hostile mesfure of
thtdireÂ£tory, by nprefenting it' as militat
j->p solely agaioii Great-Britain, I flialL in
h>y luin endeavor to prove, that thcConduft
ci the French ruler? in relation to this coun
try, has beeo from the beginning diihonelt;
fcaft aft J treacherous; and that in the pre-
Tent instance they are aiming a'death blow
at our merchants, ftiip-buildcrs, mechanics
and farmers.
At the commencement of the war between
France an ! England, we owed a debt, of
some magnitude totbe formerâbat this wa6
r.at allâFrance at that period was threat
ened with a famine, hence it became necef
fsry for her then rulers to sbferve some ma
nagement in their plans for despoiling our
citizens; and being fully imprefied with the
importance of precedents, they began their
fyitem of fraud, by imitating the example
of the Jews in borrowing from the Egypti
ans The mode of doing it was this. Thef
inftrufited. their agents in the United States
to contradt with our merchants for supplies
to an immense amount; they opened all their
ports to Â«-ur vtffels; they welcomed our cap
tains and fupercargocs to their (hores; call
el them braves AmcrlcainSjirtd almofl squeez
ed them to death with their fraternal embrac
es; until tliey had decoyed into their pof
fefficn, property to nearly half the amount
of the commercial capital of the United
States But mark the sequel. Theyrefuf
td complying with the contra&s made by
their agents on the mpft frivolous pretences,
to some of the (hippers they paid* part,"to
others nothing, and embargoed all ourfhip
pfng, until the value of both vefltls and car
goes were consumed in expences. When
these advocate* for pure principles, however,
began to perceive, that the braves Americans
were not dtfpofed to trust. them with the re
maining half of their property, they instan
taneously difcoveredthat ourveffels had been
navigating unmoleiled for several years
without the Role sEquipageâprivate or
der 3 were therefore immediately issued for
bringing in and condemning all Americans
rcffels unprovided with that document, this
order was promptly obeyed, and several
hundred of our (hipping, trading under the
fanflion of a solemn treaty and furniflied
with abundant proofs to-identify the pro
perty to be American, were captured, con
demned and fold, and the crews turned on
shore exposed to all the horrors of want.â
It was forefeen however, and predicted by
those persons who have marked the rapid
march of the French rulers toward the tem
ple of infamy, that when our veflels became
provided with this magical document, resort
would be had to feme new pretext. This
brings me to notice the late decree of the
French government, which declares as good
pn'te, " all neutral fr'ps, baaing tn board
merchandize end comnodities, the frtdisÃisn of
England, or of the English p'ffejjions."
I need not inform my readers, that every
cargo of -Weft India produce (hipped from
the United States is composed in part of
coffee and sugar from the English islands,
that all our vefftls without diftin&ian.coaft
ers included, have some fyare (lores of Bri
tifa manufafture on board; but I will bold
ly affirm, that in all caseS where the cause
of capture Ihould not happen to exiil under
;he deirce, it wiU bi fnpplird by th; castors

c )m.neid the use of preventatives to his pa- *
tient ip the agonies of death, as for this pie
tended American merchant tb erpntiatc on
the bltflings "t peace, when there is no
peace.
In contemplating the present awful ci ltis
of our affairs, we fbould do well to cor. Gdi r g
whether national calamities arc not deligned v
as punishments for national offences. Dur
ing those times which tried men's fouls t
when the iflue of the conflict was doubtful, a
when our hearts were too humble and too v
honest to miitake the objÂ«.(Sis of our gr iti i
tudr; we flocked to t>ur temples to return v
thanks to tile supreme being fur having ra' J
edus up'a powerful ally in the person of t!;e n
late unfortunate king of France*.âNa>, y
those statesmen and heroes, who under the t
. fame'divine influence conducted our n 'fairs to j f
a profperoos issue, hejd but orte opinion on 3
this head; which opinion was hy the".n ex- ' {:
preffi,*d again and again in their solemn del A'- t
erations, ?.s will mare fully apjjesr by tiÂ«e v
journals of the late congrcfs, reference be- d
irg thereunto had. What thf n mU?I be the a
language of the hiftotisri, when lie coined li
to record the events us events which tl
form a ia the annals ot this country, t
that nothing can obliterate? If a candid t
man, lie will fay, that in applauding the
conduct ot the persons who had embiued t
their hands in the blood of our deliverer - t
who had rejected the God whose ioterpofiti. t
onwefo often acknowledgedâwe were guilt
ty of the molt abominable perfidy and in- t
gratitude! 1 t
No rr->n fubfcribe6 more implicitly than t
myfelf to the axiom, that every nation has j
full right to exerci e its own discretion in t
the choice of a government âbut I deuy the v
newfangled dodtrine, that all means are law- r
ful. It was unlawful, for instance, becauie c
not neceflary to the success of the French t
revolution, that the blood of the dethroned 1.
king and his innocent family (hould be (hed 0
on the fcaffold, and their memorits branded Ji
with the most unfouoded and atrocious ca
lumnies: but if these things were unjuftifia- t
ble on the part of the French people, what t
apology can we offer for becoming parties to t
the tragedy by transferring the obligations 1
we owed to the fufferers, to their cruel and f
unreleuting persecutors. c

The letter from Philadelphia, published yes->
terdayin your paper, was unqaeftionably genu â 
ine, so far at least as to the real exprrfliou of
writer's sentiments, though prob .bly im
proved in the languige by some friendly hand.
Its tendency, though not manfully avowed, is
very obvioys to all who have watihed the po
litical char jflers and couduift ofpbMic men.â
To prepare Americans to f>ifT*r with tamcntfs
a,continuation of thoSe infultsand depredation s
which have long tried their uience, and ftrip
pidlhem of their propelty v (Â» certainly its ob
jed : and if, after feeling the public pulse by
this flight efiay, the wrier Cin flatter hirafelf,
that it may be brought to 3 temper tailed to
his views, there is no doubt hut we (hall fee
measures proposed and advocated to keep us in
our prtfent state of imbecility, without any
means of affording prsteiflion to our citizens,
and in despicable dependence on 1 foreign coun
try ; by whose arbitrary orders our commerce
is to he deftrnyed. If feme favored partisans
can make profits under these general grievances
of their countrymen, by a trade on fufferance,
to the 'A'eft-Indies, it is plainly insinuated, ihat
Â»emÂ« 4 ulcno efToi ts to deliver ourselves from
a fubjeiftion so difgraceful. Americans, it fceins,
muit renounce every principle of rational dig
nity ; nor hope, after thetr total fiibjefliori to
the power of their matters, that they will be a*
â¢ ble to fay with Francis the firft of France, after
hii defeat and captivity, -we bait UJI every
i thing hut our honor. This is not the only view
. of the letter-writer : another is, to calumniate
, the government of the United States. He has
the boldness to fiv, that the calling of congress,
last ksnreer, was with a view to produce a war.
' Whether thia discovery was made by hiinfelf,
or jderived from tbe Utter of the
I which an unadvised correspondent too hastily
I made pSblic, it is not matcrisl to enquire. Bijt
f there never was a more unfounded iinputaiipa';
and, ier the refutation of it, nothing lurther

aar.cs.nced his resolution to renew negociatjon,

DUBLIN, Jan. 9 .
We hear from. Monatterevan, that tliÂ»
house of captain Evan*, within three inilci
of that town, was attacked on Saturday
night by a party as United Irishmen, who
fired into the windows and wounded des
perately a female fcrvantâThey were not
able, however, to accotnplifh their purpose
of breaking into the house. . '
January 11.
The ensuing teini is likely to give full
occupation to the eouri of king's-beoch:
the trials of the Belfaft prisoners -for high
treason, and that of Mr.'Arthur O'Connflr
for a seditious libel, are the principal caufÂ«
cxpc&ed to come forward.

! HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
i STATE OF THE UNION,
TUESDAY MARpH IJ.
â  ' Mr. Sivjll
â  Having moved that the House go into t
. ] Committee of the Whole on the&tateaf
r J the Union, ' .
I j Mr. Nic noxashopedthe house wAtild not
â  go into a committee of the whole on thÂ«
[- u ÃÂ«te ps the union to day, as they hs3 some
treason to expect' farther information' from
) the President of the United States with re&
- pedt to our dispute with France. The let
r ter communicated from our commissioners
, refers to other letters. It fays, â¢' we fee nÂ»
. ; better profpedt of our being received than
n 1 when we wrote last." He wrfhed to havf
j the information to which this letter refers â¢,
j ' fiuce, if it was true that all negociation was
1# at an end with the French government, it
e was proper t'ne information should be l&id
- before the Lcgiflature. He hoped, there*
n fore, the house woald wait for a day or two,
t- to fee whether or not farther information
t woÂ»ld be sent to the house oti this fubjetff.
It' . Mr. Sew ax l said, that the howfe were
:, already informed, that, in the opinion t4
i. the commissioners, all piofpeft of negoeia
e tion with the French government had ceifed,
n but as, farther communications on the fnb
ject might be cxpefted, the feledl commit
l. tee did not wish the house at present to gs
g into any new measures, but pierely fo.g*
M into a consideration of the resolutions re
5. ported in January last, which might be danÂ«
5 . without any further information, from thji
g President.. He supposed the information
which h?d been sent to the house was intendr
ed to haftentheirproceedings in taking mea
ts fures for the protection of our commerce
[y and the defence of the country ; and if nÂ»
n . information at all had been received froÂ»
at France, be supposed the house would have
g. thought it necessary to have gone into the
defentive measures proposed, though thjy
of might, in that cafe, have driven it till tÂ»Â»
fe wards the close of the session.
Ie Mr. Harper said, if he could be of opi*
)n nion that all the members of this house
he fatisfied as to the neceflitj of going at P rr "
in Cent into the measures propÂ»fi.J, he (Viould
" ar be ready to go into a committee of the whole
;r . on the state of the union. He himfelf tho t
vn there was information fufScient in the com
munication which had been received, to ao
j : thori/e the house in immediately atting i'
of pon the bu'fintfs ; bat as he doubted whe
he tlier other gentlemen were of this opinioÂ®,
it and as more might be expefted, he wifted
yj to wait for it, as'it might produce greater
f m unanimity as tothe ncceflityof the meafurei
'ti. which itmigkt bethought propet to take*
f e . . Mr. Dana said, though the commiÂ® o "'
we ers had written a folio before, the ' ctt^
which had been laid beforetlxehoufe was â¢
t;]l result of the y-'holt, as they t*ll the Irt â¢"
uls dent they have abandoned all hope oi
ind commodatiou. And he thought we vtr
nyS brought to that situation in whiih wÂ« Â»u
jay whether wc will take any means for t.
piefervrition of our rights and liberties, <â 
' submit depredations and infultscois
srr. milted upon us by a foreign power.
Mr. J. Wi-t.[amihopwl the house wor.r<t
wait for the furthtr infsrmation wbicfc
by roight bft expefted froit "wis datable that Â»'VfÂ« the koaft went into
this fubjeft, theyfliould do so wtcha* much
unanimity at pofiibie.
Mr. Nicholasjuftificd what lie had be
fore obfervea with refpecfc to the letter of
our commiflionert, which (he said) contain
ed no fa&s, but referred to their former
communications, and agiin urged the im
â¢propriety of going into the bufinef. at pre
feut.
Mr. RuTLifioÃ could not agree with the
gentleman fmm Virginia thai the left* from
our Commiflioners .contained uo fai!i upon
which thehoufe couid deliberate. In his o
piuion it contained a very ilrong, extraor
dinary and melancholy fndt. It informed U3
that on the Bth of January out commiflion
ert had not been received by the French re
public, and although they had been near
four months at Paris, they still continued to
exhibit the strange and humiliating fpe&acle
of the representatives of an independent
people foliciymg in Â»ain to be heard. If the
late communication from the President had
*ot been received, and the heufe remained
ignorant of the situation of our trillion tq
France, it would be expedient to adopt the
, measures which were now attempted to be
brought before the committee of the whole
on the state of the union; for all that was j
pressed for at present was, to have our un- .
fini/hed frigate* completed and equipped, â¢
and an additional appropriation for the pro- !
teelion of Â«ur ports, harbors and sea-coasts.
With refpe<St to the frigates,the house would
recoflccft that when a bill to appropriate for
the finifhing of them was called up some '
â weeks ago, its consideration was postponed
for the purpose of obtaining information a
bout the expenditures which had already
taken place with rtfpeft to ihem; the bill
was then poftponcd becanfe the gentleman
before him from NewYorkfMr. Living (Ion)
wanted information ffom the war-office ; at
bis request a committee was raiftd for the
purpose of obtaining it; and notwithftand
jng the zeal and anxiety Ihewn by the gen
tleman .from New-Vork, three weeks had e
lapsed without the committee's having been
called together. With refpeft to the ne
eeflity of some defence for eur coast, it was
so palpably efleutial that he could not eon.
ceive why any gentleman could wi(h to post
pone the neceflary measure until we should
!:ear further from France ; the documents
upon every gentleman's table no* only jufti
fitd the going immediately into some mea
fnre* of defence, but rendered it ahfolutely
neceflary; of all these documents he would
call the attention of the house to one only ;
that was so strong as to render it tinnecefla
ry to notice others; it was the communica
tion received through the Executive, from
â¦he gqvernor of South Carolina, in which
we are informed of the gross violation of
Â©nr neutral rights, in the burning of an.
Englilh /hip in the harbor of Charleston.
The governor fays this was the a<S of a pi
rate; hedoesnot giveit at his mere opinion,
that the crew of thitTeffel were pirates, but
/peaks positively, and fays they were, that
he tvas perfwidrd Â»f it. If then, in additi
on to the multitude of newspaper informa
tion, we have this, official account of the
toad of a state, in the neighborhood of
â¢whore coal! therÂ« it much wealth, being in
fefted hy pirates, surely it is neceflary to go
jato some measures of defence. But the
gentleman from Virginia will wait for more
_ information: he wants to know what our
commillionert wrote and did anterior to the
Bth of January; this information might grat
ify the curiosity of gentlemen, but it cer
tainly wat not neceflarys the house ;knew
the icfult of our commifliÂ«ners having been
â¢t Paris feijie months, it knew that they
not been received by the French govern- j
stent and had no expectation of it. This
information was public, it was before our
eonftituents ; they were waiting with im
patience and anxiety to know what congress ,
would do. Mr. R. wilhed to put an end ] <
to their impatience ; he wilhed to fatisfy in
some measure the honor of his country, and I
he wilhed to give some protc&ioa to her '
much exposed interests .
Mr. Hartiet said, the House might
fafely go itvto a committee of whole on the
state of the Union. A Refolutiun for equip- '
ping the frigates wat the firft tn order, and '
he fuppoCtd there would be no obje&ion to ,
taking up that fubjed. The purchaflng of ,
vetTels would be another confederation. He r
believed the people were mweli surprised at
the delay which had taken place in thit bu
ftntfs. When we had a dispute with great '
Britain, he said, an Envoy Extraordinary *
Was sent to* that country, and our differ- â
encet were accÂ®mitiodated ; but the French
refufe to receive our Commiflionert, which 4
is a proof that they must despise this coun- f
try, and he feared it would be neceflary to
take very strong measures before Congrtfs 1
rofÂ«. At present, he supposed, there would "
â¢ be no obje&ion to the taking of measures 'j
â¢r the prote&ion of our coast. si

d-
M r F.N NO,
0 ' In Mr. Bach:*t paper this morning is dc
ie tailed the fulfilment of a prophecy, which
nt the Editor fays, we(meaning himfelf) made
r " about John Adams, when he was ap
'; pointed Mjtiifter at Berlin : viz.â" When
" John Q;_ Adams the son of our President
vva* from the Hague and sent to
u , " Berlin ou a new appointment with a' ne<w
" " outfit, we that he would be
" made to perform the circuit through the

" autfit at each removal, as such business
'* would he found more profitable than any
' " he fottld follow,at home, and as it was
e " the duty of every father to provide hand- ,

re j " could be done at the pnblic cxpence.â '
j " Our hint has bsen taken and John Q.
ay [ " Adams has been appointed for Stock" !
" n Â» 'Â« holm." ; 1
Thus far Mr. Bache's prophecy and fulfil
r. ment. Now, Sir, permit me. to inform the '
er public, thro' your paper that when John '
of Adams wasappointed to Berlin, he had 1
ijr not a new outfit, other than a small sum 1
whieh was scarcely fufficient to bear hi* ex- !
pence* from the â¢ Hague to Berlin ; Mr. 1
ic Bach* very well knows an outfit to a mim'f- *
Â»â¢ ter i* generally underftoodto be one year's fa
Â°f lary, and the law of the United Stated .
fanftions such an outfitâthis was not given,
j r and Mr. Bache know* the fafl. Mr. A
ir damo, when he received hi* commiflioa for
the Court of Berlin was at London, from (
p wkich place he was preparing for his voyage
_ to Lifhon, in pursuance of an appointment
to that Courtâhe bad takea a house there,
>f purchafcd hi* furniture, and paid the fare w
j for himfelf and wife ; aad the facrifica he
was forced to make, in changing hi* route
.. fÂ° r Berlin, wa* much more, iqcluding the
>r aSual expenee* of the journey than the sum
he received a* an outfit, which has been puh-
T lilhed in all the newspaper* a* aa item in the
appropriation* for that year.
Now, Mr. Adamt ha* power* given him
. to negotiate a treaty with Sweden, and iÂ» S
not to recaive a farthing addition, either a*
â¢ salary or outfit ; nor it he to leave Berlin : s i
| This faft may not have been knows to Mr.
Bache, but if he hat any candor, he will
corredl this error, if no more. The re- 2 ,
- proach, contained in the publication of the
- President aad hi* son, will be properly ap- c<
predated by the public, *rhen they know

MR. 7KNNO,
" The times" seem to be fill aj.'proachinp that
) may again " try mer.'t fault"âthe call is loud
f for energetic to combinct the whole
â  strength of our csuntry ; to make the best pol
lible arrjngemetfts in every civil and mil tary
â  line; and above all, to put the finaa eÂ» in the â
best trainâthat by all these mesna we naay be
prepared to meet -vhatever evils or Hangers lie
1 before uÂ«. And, " trufling in the Got) of our Ft
: fathers," we ought nor to â¢Â« fe.ir wliat men can 2C
1 dÂ« untouÂ»"âbut wi(h jiuls,tr/B defythe â¢u/d-uei ua
; tjgers of the earth and seas. Surely goad 1
men will now unite to promote the i'afety and .
general weal of tl eir cou .tryâand not ("uffcr 1451
party views or. passions to influence their ton- w<
dufl. Union is a nation's strength, omjme'nt, P a
and wealthâAmerica united, will ever com- wi
mand the refpeifl of all nalions; but if divided,
will be a prey to all.
It iimueh to be refwted, Mr. Printer, that res
aÂ» this alarming pjriud, there remains any un fatS
â¢fettled claims for ferviees during the revolution ,i a ,
war ; and we are sorry to observe frvere ceo- â¢]
â fures upen government on account of the new m ''
emrffion tills Â»f credit, as they ire called. It is P' a
to be hoped (bis claim way have a full and can
did difiuflion in t.tc senate, where we are'toi 1 it
now is, that all impartial men mav be fatiifud ffia
with the ji) ft ice 0/ our government. The vote r .. a
the heuft, I mud confefs, Mr. Printer, was
not supported by such cleat evidence of equity
as I could wist. The question is, "Is not an .
which promises te ensure ihe pjy Ta '
of the Ml, and to pay the interest annually in
, !f. ,, eXle h*ngÂ«,"an absolute contrail, equal- '
ly binding on nvery citixeo ? All judges of law the

"a government nf laws." It has been fair:
however that n condition i? exprtfcd in the afl

to the principalâand that from the tenor of the
