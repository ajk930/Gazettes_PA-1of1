TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public prints,
rnds, warnirrg all persons agaisft purchasing from the
1 the grantees ?f Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
â¢V?' l sr g f â  real snd P ei fÂ° nal estates he conveyed away to
r U his fon-in law and tÂ» hiÂ» children was the result of
tied a a deliberation had upon the fubjedt by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
ortei M'Clenachan and P. Moore a* of Blair M'Clena
g'atit chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confided in the fubferibers by
ftjnct those creditors: a step which it would bave been a
s breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very ftatcment of the fa& therefore mud dis
pel the imputation that it was eithfcr " precipitate
. or viadidlive." It eriginated in a desire to secure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the p*y
r ment of his just debts. It was fanflioned by the
advice ot council as a measure ntcejary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advertilement has been
down injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
ed in j 0 y s own unjuftiliable conduct, not to the iubÂ«
If' fctibers who have merely publi(hÂ«d the trutli in
terms as mild as the fadt would admit, and whe
ine y mean to investigate in a'high court of justice the
Eittes. validity of thole purchases ef whieh Mt. M'Cle
nachan so confidently fpeakl.
'â¢ The fubferibers therefore are bound by a sense
of doty to the creditors in general to repeat their
caution against purahafing of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
' their purchase from any other persons (if such there be)

Conclusion oj th: debate on the address in anfv/er
j- evcc to the Prtfident's speech.
Thursday, December 15-
Mr. Sitgreave, said he wished to propose an a
mendment in the fourth fc&ion of the address. It
[Eons, had been thought that the committee bad not ex
pressed with fufficient strength the desire of the
. house to preserve harmony with the French repub
-ftore' '' C * an arnÂ£n dnAent had accorJingly been agreed
Book- ,0 Â» to cncreafe the force of the pafiage. For his
own part, hefaid, he had no objection to the use
of themoft emphaiical cxpieffions of desire to pre
serve peace with that country ; but he thought
um, there was a sentiment which it was equally import
ant to have expressed as unequivocally, and in al
strong terms, viz. that it, from any unfavorable
Iw circumstances, the harmony heretofore subsisting
betwixt this country and the French republic, should
be interrupted, that'the people of this country are
Qrctt, determined to aflert themfelve, again ft all aggres
sions, ihe resolution to assert onrfclvcs in this
way, ought alwaya, he said, to be in as llroiig
tof as the desire for peace. This determination,
it was true, was already cxpiefled in the anfwe-r ;
hut finee the amendment had been made, it was
s aot fufficiently Itrong.
Mr. S. supposed that the abftraA importanee &
propriety of this would be evident, in order to
aid any negociation which the executive might un-
Sea - dertake ; but he was led to give additional weight
rarei l Â° hi ' ar S UlÃent what had fallen from the
gentleman who brought forward the amendment to
wa- 'his clause. They had been tol<3, that whatever
ignorance might be- pretended, that all the griev
& ances complained of by the French government re
, or felved 'hcmfclvcs into a diflatisfadion of the British I
treaty , that this had been the cause of a suspension :
of of their minuter, of the orders far '
capturing of our yeflels, &c. and that these will j
con'tinue until they receive fatisfadlion. If this '
was ically the cafe, he, for his part, did not expect
a favorable issue to the nepociation. He should
mon hope it would not terminate in peace. If harmony
could not be preserved, except we abandon the
contrast which we have made with Great-Britain,
he trusted the termination would not be an aban
donment of our honor and of our rights.
AÂ» there had been attempts made, Mr. S. observ
ed, todiawa line between the government of this
country and the people, artfully insinuating that the
acts of government were not in unison with the
any voice of the people, he wifked it unequivocally to
appear to the world, that whatever differences of
mil opinion there might be in th t house, in one fenti
-U ment ' at least, all were united, viz. in opposing
" t ? s ,llc a Â£grefiionÂ« of any country. That this fenti
of ment of asserting our rights, should be expressed ;
ood "it' l firmaefs, but moderation, was essential to the
peace and honor of our country. I
Mr. S. therefore moved to strike out the words ,
,c " from Â«Â« while" to Â«Â« countryman," towards the ,
conclusion of the paragraph, and to insert, ,' at ,
rge the fame time that we aflureourfdves that your just .
in confidsnce in the pattiotifm, felf.refpedl and foiti- ,
for tude of our countrymen, will not in any event be (
disappointed, and that they will not on'any occa- <
tall f,on tor g et what â¢Â» to the character and govern. ,
ment of our nation."
Before he laid this amendment on the table, he i
would observe, in, confirmation of what had been c
ftaied by the gentleman from Maffachufett, (Mr. L
Ames) that the answer leported was the result of ,
aceommujation aud comprÂ«iraife ; but, as addition- f
al emphafi, had been given to the defiie of harmo- -
iiy and peace, he was desirous that a Jike additional
force should be given to the other part of the fen
tencc.
Mr. Nicholas said the proportion of the gentle- v
â man j"' l fat down went to the pledging 8
at all events to support the executive in the dif- o
pute with the French government. He was not
willing- to do this. He had purposely .voidedfay- a
â¢iil ing any thing in this debate on the difpure subsist- )i
he ing betwixt this country and France. He was c- ei
ct, ven iilent when he heard an insinuation made that OI
the mifunderflandiag between the two countries
was fomented by American citizens in Paris. He si
had meant, indeed, at feme future time, to have
- called upon the gentleman who made this assertion
for information, as he certainly knew the circum
>r fiance, of which he spoke ft, confidently, to be
ic "r C ;. " e confill Â« re d the dispute with France, 'a, , D
t- a [ ub J e Â« n Â°t yet ripe f or dif.uffion. They were t
Df told by the Prelideut that he reserved hi, commu- ,'h
mcatlon on this fubjed* to a future period For f
hi, part, he had never yet .ead the French mini ft"
fter . note having been but a few da ; ,in ,hc city, u
it had not fallen m his way. He l.ad no doubt ihc he
executive would fettle the buhnefs amicably with h
n the Fiench republic ; but he should think iiimfelf m
unpardonable to pledge himfelf to any thing re- â¢
,e fpcdling it at present. He tuonght the proceedinir
r. an extraordinary one; he believed however the Z
X form, of the house admitted of a remedy for a bu- j n
.. f ' nef ' of th " k,l,d > a tÂ»Â» : Â« was by clllintr for F
, the previous queftioa. He therefore moved the If
f previous qucftion.
Mr. Hartley said he was not present when the U
" communication of the President was received ; but mÂ«
he thought they were not called upon to gâ so f, r 1,
'Z L 1 of hi, colleague proposed. He c l a
'Tr V / a ! d bf < areful , 'Â°* they went into of
a business of tlus k.nd, The fubjed was not at L
present npe. The President was at this time oro
bably fettling the matter amiiably. He hoped the def
gentleman would therefore withdraw his motion intl
and âot force .t upon the house. When .here feenv b c
ed to be a dilpofmon of unanimity, he hoped it hea
wou d not be dil urbed by this motion. They had |
a dehcare part, he said ,0 afl. The world was M,
armed at all point,, and we were not. If war was n '
declared against France, he should wish that it
m.ght be done unanimously. He hoped the rao . nr
tion v/oul j be withdrawn.

*SS? Mr. Sitgreaver. said he was sorry that Lis rtlotiorl
had created in the mind of his colleague any thing
like alarm. In the fame breath in which he had
emphatically declared that he concurred in i : .e
wi(h to cultivate peace and harmony with tin;
ifwer French Republic, that gentleman came forward
' and said if war wai declared he hoped it would fie
done unanimously. He had ft*'ed they had no
information on the fubjeff. Was there anything
in this resolution, he asked, which required infoi.
ma- mation. It was stated by the President that dif-
I. It fereneeshad arifea which he regretted. He alio
t ex- slated it to be his wish tc cultivate peace and h r
f the iHony with the French Republic; but he (late*
:pub- that, in pursuing this, he (hall not forget what ia
greed due to the chara&et and government of our na
r his tion.
e use The amendment he had proposed conveyed no
pre- o'her fentimeut, and ought by all means to be com
ught nedted with the earned wish expressed for peace,
port- There was nothing about declaring war or wishÂ«
in al i"g for war, but that we (hould in any *vent not
rable forget what was due to our national character. \
sting There was nothing offenfive or irritating agairrt J
lould the French Nation, or any other nation in this,
y are Any feutinieat of this kind must arise fiom the
gref- gentleman's own feeling, and not from his propo.
this fition. He was glad the yeas and nays had
ro*g called for ; if they had not been called, he himfelf
tion, wouU had made the motion.
ver ; In answer to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
was Nicholas) hi would just fay,'that this houle, or
this country were not pledged, this resolution,
e & to do any thing which we ought not to do.
rto Mr. Claiborne hoped the motion of the gentle
un- fan from Pennfyivania would not be put,' as it
ight carried with it an afpeÂ£t, and he vviihed by
the a" means to preserve peace with the French Re
it to public.
ever The Speaker reminded the house that the pre
â¢iev- viousqueltion had been callcd for and that gentle
t re- men must confine their observations te that object.
itifh , Mr. W. Smith said gentlemen might as well
lion | be muzzled, if they were not permitted to speak
; their fentiraents.
W'jl j The Speaker infilled upon the gentleman con
this ( fcning hi in felt to order.
? c & Mr. W. Smith said herofetogive his reafona
' in favour of adopting the propoied amendment,
Â°"y and against the previous queliioni
seemed to think that at some time it might be
am, proper to enter into such a resolution, tut not
ian- novv , He conceived that this was the proper
time, and would give his reasons for that opinion
Â«Â»- â because it refpeAs the fubjed before' tbero, the
this j answer to the Prefident'* addiefs, and because
the | fomethtHg of the kind seemed to be called for, to
the i declare that we did not depend entirely on the juf
rto j tice and moderation of the French Nation j that
or I we were determined to i'upport cur Executive ia
["'* maintaining the dignity of our country, and that
">g | we were not so alarmed by the note of their Mini
nti ; fter, as to throw ourselves upon the mercy of that 4
| nation.
l " c Gentlemen said they had no information on the
fubjeft. He alked thtm whether the French Mi
r. nllte ( r had not appealed to the people of the Uni
t*e ted b'.ates ? And whether it was not proper for
at them to speak on this occafioa ? He Hates that his,
. nation is offended with ours, and that the meal'mW
ti- which that Government has taken will continue Hn
be till our Government returns to hfelf by a i nnate
Ci " ofesniua. In his opinion, Mr. Smith said, 'this
rn " w " the proper time lor thole gentlemen who con
cetved that government had maintained fts neutral,
e it/ with wiidom and Hrmnrfs, to come forward and
â 5" declare it ;to fay to the executive it might depend f
r - upon that house for fupp-m. There was no threat
-0 n 'ng, he said in this. The threat did not come
J " from us ;it came from the French Government.
I he French Mimftei had laid great stress upon the
treaty with Great Britain, which he conliders as a
:,i " violation of reutraliry, and a just cause of offenee.
If this idea was pursued, he laid we must bÂ«ve war
|Â«. with one nation or the other. Would not, then,
'es gentlemen fay to the Executive you inay rely ' up
if. on uj.
r,t Mr. Smith said he had made these obfervationg
y. and had endeavoured to cotih e himfelf within the 1
ft. line of order (about which he had been hampered)
f. endeavouring to Huwthat the motion of his friend
at ought to be agreed to.
es The fpeakei read the rule of the hoÃfe on the
le fubjeft ot order.
Mr. Hartley said that he wiflied to withdraw hit
oppofiuan. He now saw the neceflity of the mo
" lion of his colleague, and should support it.
5c Mr. Harper conceived it to be ftriaiy in order
" ;Â° " le " that the propoM declaration was proper to
'Â« be puffed at this time. If he had a right idea of
1 the previous queflion, it could not have an effcA to
'. r dt bate. He ft lo uld therefore, go on to
' "ate ore or two thing, whi.h he thought impor-
Y, taut, and he would begin by declaring, that it he
>e believed the resolution went to the oledgioy the x
' house to any particular measures they hereafter
might fee reason to disapprove, he would not only

Ihe speaker said the gentleman was out of or

er informed him he could rife only to explain. (The
speaker read the rule on this fubjed.) Mr. Harper
rose, and the fpesker wiflied to know whether he

in Extra& from the Journal of the Senate.
' Saturday, December 17, 1796.
to The committee appointed to confer with the di
to rectors of the bunk of Pennsylvania, chosen by
thehenatc, having, according to the directions of
r _ the Senate, joined the committee of the House of
It Keprefeutatives, appointed "to -eceive, from the
In- dircdor. of rhe bank of Pennsylvania who have
er bee. appointed by the any communi
lt. c*tton( they may make relating to that institution,"
r . reportâj
" r 'a""* 3t the srft conft,t ' nce w 'Â«h the faij '
st directors, they informed your cemmiitee, that :
c . John Barclay, Esq. pi fa-dent of the said bank, had
â¢d applied, to his own use, a large sum of money,
is 'he property of the bank ; that the said director,, '
j. as the immediate repr< Tentative. of the state in that
K '"ft'tU'ton, conceived it to be their duty, 10 make
an early commu lication of t"ne circuro(hÂ»ce to the
Le b iflaiure, not only for their information, but
â that a committed might be appointed to receive,
fiom time to time, an account of any other cir
rs cumllances which, on itiv C l>iga:ion, might appear
; to demand attention.
Ie At a subsequent conference with the said direst-
T |ors, your committee were info.med, that a more
â | accurate investigation nf the atcounts of the bank
,f :ake "- P lat ' C ' Wl '^ n il appeared, that Jonathan
Mifflin, the late calhier, and several Â»iher persons,
. had, by over drafts and other means, obtained from !
,f the auk sundry fnms of money, the property of !
the : ank ; that, in consequence of this difeovery,
0 the diltdtors applied for payment of the several <
(linn so procured, a confide*ask portion of which i
has been paid in money, and security taken for the
remainder, except to a fmali amount.
J Upon the whole, your committee are of opinion,
â that thelffs which the ftocklioldcrs of the bank of;
Pei<nfylÂ»a;.ia may sustain, by the <iifagree*ble trai.f
atftions above fpeciticd, will amount to a very in.
coi.hdeiable sum, being, in the estimation of the
â  diteflors, lefn than Bfieen thousand dollars, from
every canfe, fiuce the commencement of the insti
tution.
Your committee think it proper to (late, for the
iiifoimation of the Senate, that the whole amount
of ovcr-dia!ts was about two hundred thousand
: dollars.
1 J They, with pleasure, add, that the conduct of
â¢ I the direclor. on the part of the state, throughout
, , this bulinefs, merits the approbation of .-,11 who arc
| lnterelted 111 the welfare of that :nftitution ; and
I th;t they have reason to belies, the Bank is in a
â  fit j*.on perfeftlr fafe, and, therefore, dcfcrving
1 the confidence of the public in general '
1 __ I
Ho'jfe of Keprefentatives. j
Yeilerday the house w s engaged in hofinefs re
la'ive to the bank of Pennfylvan.a. Some Jays !
fil". a leloluiion parted their body, appointing a
joint committee of the two houses to it-ipme o*l he
Direflom of that bank, for the purpose of laying
before the fioule, a llatemeut of the accounts of
the said Bank, includiag an acco.mt of the notes
111 circulation, notes and cafa in r.a.id, &c. This
refolntion was sent to the Senate for concurrence ; '
but inltead of concurring in this reioiiuiosi, they
sent a diffe rentone to the house of Reprefentn- 1
rives, upon a principle which had already been v
overruled in that house, appointing a committee f
to make the enquiry, and to report generally. '
Fhis lefolution was yesterday under consideration, v
when Mr. Lieb moved-to puflpone the bufiuel". lor 1
the ptirpofe of appointing a conference betwixt
the two houses. This was objt&ed to on the
ground of unneceffariiy protra&iug the bufinels,
which, it was would unnoceffarily injure
,ne credit of the Bank, by rxcitu g unueceffary "
alarm. On Mr. Evans obferviug that if the house a
h d been more particular in its enquiries hereto- d
toi e, the mifehiefs which had arisen by the over
drawing of individuals, would m l probably have
happened, Mr. Wain replied that the gentleman
was miltaken iti fuppotmg *wy enquiry the Legif- 11
lature had a right to make could prevent the over- t
drawing of individuals, fjnee a committee from the v
two houses had not power to look into the ac- c*
counts oi iadividujls, but merely to obtain a grne- t
ral flatement. He was in favour of the refolu- C
Hon from the Senate, as comaiaing all that was d
neceffaiy, though he said he doubted not the cob- b
ctrns of the Bank would bear the drifted fciutiny, si
and particularly at this time, as the preferit was a â¢'
season peculiarly favourable to the Banks in Phila- w
delphia. But, if gentlemen supposed (as it had 1
been hinted in the courfc bf the debate) that the H
bank of Pennfylvawia, or any other Bank, eould at
any moment answer all the demands which might "
be made upon it, they were miflaken. If this were
tbe ease, laid he, how ciruld we receive nine per d
cent for ourmoney, when the Batik onlv charges h
Jix to its ruftomers ? ' a<
If this were so, dockhqlders could receive 110
! more than would remain out of 6 per cent, when
| all the expences of conducing the business were de ti
fiayed. But, Mr. Wain added the profits of a
bank arise from its being able to discount beyond b
its capital, and any step taken which had a tenden- Â£
cy to lefien the good opinion of the public in an --
institution of this kind, would necefTariiy rsnder it ~*
less produflive. At length the sense of the houle
was taken by yeas and nays, when there appeared ?!
40 in favour of the podponement and 22 ajrainii
it.
Mr. Leib then moved that a committee of con
ference with the Senate be appointed 5 but en some
objeftioHs being made to it, he withdrew his mo
tioi, and the house adjourned. The answer to the
address did nAt come under coofidention.
