)>tr. Fenno,
I confuler myfelf bound in jnftice to Mr.
Smith of South Carolina tocontradift
the falfe ftat.ement, in Bache's paper of ycf
terday, of hi 3 observations concerning the
of Foreign Miniftcrs in Congress.
prefent through the whole of the de
mote and can therefore attest the following to
bf & true account of the matter :
Mr. Dayton, the Speaker, had cenfu
redMr. Harper, (Mr. Smith's colleague)
for making certain observations refpe&ing
Foreign nations in the prejcnce of their Repre
sentatives. Mr. Smith in answer animad
verted on Mr. Dayton for exprefiions which
tended to reftrik the privileges of the mem
bers -He.did not juftify or condemn any thing
his colleague had said, " but wished merely
to vindicate the rights of the house, which
}ie thought attacked by Mr. -Dayton's cen
sure. Mr. Smith faidthat no member Ought
to fed himfelf restrained from express ng his
opinions freely and difclofingfuch sentiments
as he thought pertinent to the debate, on
account t>f the presence of any foreign minis
ter, that while the member was in order,
and so allowed to be by the Chair, the pre
sence of a-foreign minister ought to hav; no
influence -whaUver on him, and that a con
trury idea would be repugnant to the pro
tÂ«Â£liÂ«n afforded the members by the con'ii
tut-on, v.-hich declared Â«â¢ that they should
not be <ju<ftio.ncd in an* other pl-.c: for ;.cy
fpcieh or debate io the house." Mr. Smith ( La-.
I avtr did cot employ eoarfe language : lin
ascribed tp him by Bach:'t correspondent; he enc
only said, in polite terms, that, " While cos
the membars were solemnly deliberating on ' her
the great affairs of the nation they should fan
confidcr themfclws as entjiJy among them- to
selves,' and rfot as addressing their obferva â¢ tie
tiojl3 to the bystanders, that the house lot
did -not.ftivite the audience nor foreign mi- he
nifters to hear their debates, and th:' if they wt
attended and heard unpleasant things, the m;
members .were surely not tq blame ;he should an
be sorry for his part that any foreign minis- afl
tera (hould be in that disagreeable predica- ( wt
ment,but it nevertheless ought not to check ty
any member frcvrtS freely delivering those bi
sentiments, which, in his opinion the good m
of his country required." b<
As I was, along with many others near if
me, much pleased with tliÂ»fe manly and pa- pi
triotic sentiments, so proper to be inculca- w
ted at this critical period, and could not fefc w
without disgust, the impertinent reflections pi
of some meddling Foreigner ( the evidentwwrit)
terof the piece in question) I have pleaiurc in
in paying my tribute of gratitude and juflice fa
to an independent member whose exertions w
for the good of his country were sure to be I*
rewarded with the execrations of its Ene- bi

Conclusion of Air. Gallatin's Speech on a{
the Amendment proposed by Mr. Nicholas. t(
Gentlemen in this discussion have taken a g
very wide scope indeed, and the gentleman t(
from South Carolina in particular, who' is a]
usually very cool, had indulged himfelf in ti
a poetical flight ; he had indeed forgot him- ft
felf and launched into aflertions for which tl
therewas not the lead; foundationâfpeaking
of the conduct of the several French minis- vt
ters, he had described Genet as making an Â«
appeal to the people, Fauchet as fomenting t<
an infurre&ion, and Adet as insulting the a;
secretary ; the particular point he meant to Â«
notice was the fomenting an insurrection : b
he was willing to allow that his constituents tl
on that occasion had not behaved well ; but si
it must be in the recolleftion of many gen- a
tlemen in that house, that the common cry a
and charge againft-them at the time was, w
that they were going to join the British, i;
and even the letter of Fauchet himfelf de- ti
. clares it to be the cafe ; it is true he would a
r.ot place much reliance 011 that man -
: who could write on a fubje& pne day and n
â  sign a certificate to the contrary another ; p
1 but he believed he was right in faying it was li
; a poetical flight just made to round a peri- b
od, he had found poetical occupations for t
.. his firft and last personage, and it was ne- d
â¢ ceffary to find some business for this middle h
â¢ person : indeed this was rendered certain, ii
" for he had never heard of but one other au- v
" thority for the flight, for it was never be- ii
! foreafierted but by one Phocion and Wil- a
f liam Wjlcocks. a
1 The gentleman has with the spirit of a j
â  legislator almost as sublime as his poetical j
Â» chara&er, told us that he should prefer car- *
5 rying the question with only a majority of \
} one or a casting vote, than .not at all ; a ma- s
j jority of what, of the representatives of the
e people ; thus then it appears that this gen- t
r tleman who i* at turns recommending una- t
a nimity, and the union of the people, is in- 1
f different about an equal division ; content j t
â¢ with the unanimity of the government âso i
! the Senate and Executive agree with a majo- 1
rity carried -only by one, the gentleman 1
g cares not-if the remaining half of the rep-. 1
a refentatives, and their constituents differ up-.; 1
r on the question to be dicidedâw<* fee then j '
who it is that reaily wishes to divide the go
~ vernmer.t from the people.
~ But he hoped that such adverse opinions
would not prevail in that house, they were
â¢ baleful to the very happiness of the country
h and the due credit of the government, he
:o hoped that a great majority would be found
a unanimous in refilling the ralhnefs that
ln would drive us to a war ; he hoped that
a there would not be found one man, unless
J,' IT WAS THOSE WHO WERE EAGER AFTER
power or monev, who anticipated in the
to deflations of war, the realization of rich
of es by plunder, either as agents, contractors,
:>e or one or other of'thofe train of wretches,
E< * that hover like vultures in rear of battlesâ
to then none but such as these would be found
eager to involve us in calamities which were
too grievous to be yet forgotten among us,
and too terrible to be encountered but in the
last extremity.
Whatever may be our determination, he
fr. said rafli or weak men should not divert us
IÂ£l from our sober purposes, in the pursuit of
;f- measures calculated for accommodation and
he peace :âWe could not be. too speedy in our
fs. decisions ; the events on the other fide of the
[e- Atlantic, are so rapid, as not to be within
to our reach or control, we do not know the e
vents which have already taken place ; he
[u- would not rely on the generosity of any na
e) tion, in particular circumstances ; and there
ng is 110 knowing the extent to which success
re- might lead men, under a mistaken impreflion
id- of injury ; we ought to loÂ£e no time ; the
ch haughtinefb of France has overwhelmed
m- nearly all Europe on land.âWhat she may
ng do next we know not ; whether she is jult
ely orunjuft, we should at least not lose time in
ich negotiationâand we ought the more readily
en- to do this, because there i 6 no man in Ame
rht rica, of what party he may be, who will
Lis not resist, if resistance is required ; there -
nts fore while the conflict is doubtful, we should
on determine our affairs, and as the amend
rtif. ment appears to furnifh the only grounds
ler, upon which negotiation is at all likely tp be
ire- attended with the necessary effedl of feenring
no peace and independence, that ought to be
on- preferred.
iro- The amendment had been opposed on va
i&i- rious other grounds, and among the molt
tild curious was that of the gentlemap from S.
'.oy Carolina ( W. Smith)âhe fays, either we
i , Lave or we have not granted a favor to Eug- He
: lind ip the provilion article ; and his infer- gei
; ' ences are, if wc have net, France cannot at
: j complain ; but if we have, finfce (he has Â£y his
1 her decree of tile 2d r larch tad taken the
1 fame advantages to herfeif, (he has no right vai
- to ooir,plain; thus, according to that gen- lie
â¢ tlemati's logic, we have done France the as
e kindest favors, whether we meant it or not ; th
- he would just obfervc, and the committee
y would not forget it, that this fort of argu- m
e ment did not belong to the fuppoiters of the dc
d amendment, âwe fay France lias no right to
f- a flume those immunities, we do not allow it; tl<
i- we fay of the 2(1 article' of our trea- to
k' ty with France (he cannot insist on it ; 01
fe ; but fuppefing we (hould agree in the gentle
d man's style, and fay either we are resolved to t'
be attached to Great-Britain or we are not, 01
ar if we were such arguments might be very tl
a- properly used to cement that union, but if (h
a- we are not, in the name of common sens hi
efc why objeft to the amendment. We who oi
11s propose the amendment fay the British trea- W
ri- ty exilts, it is the law of the land, and we
rc insist upon keeping it ; we confefs we have h:
ce said it was a bad one, and so we fay (till, but rt
ns we will not therefore go beyond it with you 1 n
be France, we (hall agree to make you equal, ; w
1e- but no more. The gentleman appeared to jo
coincide in one particular, that was in their tl
opinion of the British treaty ; they felt so ti
sensibly aliv>_ to it that they dreaded even to o
touch it, and yet they infilled that it was uni- e
S. verfally popular, and that Its popularity en- tl
creased in proportion as it became more 11
known ;he would leave gentlemen unmo- a
lefted in the solacing indulgence of that idea I
ort as long as they could persuade themselves in- v
to. such a phantasy ; but he would just fsg
a geft to gentlemen, that there did not appear t
an to him a likelihoed of its gaining a consider- t:
is abla (hare of popularity on the western fron
in tier when the memorial of the Spani(h mini- t
ti- Iter (hall have found its way into that part of n
ch the United States. 1
ig It has been several times asserted, that all r
if- we can fay or do on the afTr irs with Franee t
an will be now perfectly useless, for (lie is de- t
ig termined to go to war with us at all events, 1
he and various reasons are assigned for this, a- y
to mong others that (lie is resolved to make us 1
- break the British treaty, and to overturn c
its the British. trade ; âgentlemen might have t
ut fufficient authority for these reasonings q
n- and they might not ; âindeed he would not f ;
ry argue it with thert on this occasion j he c
is, would suppose it possible that France would t
fh, facrifice her interests with us to injure that
le- trade which is the vital support of Britain, c
ild and commence a war with us on that account u
an âbut if such is really the .opinion of gentle- t
nd men, ought it not to"" be the firft and most t
r ; pressing motive with us to adopt measures (
'as likely to extricate us from such difficulties j 1
ri- but do gentlemen believe the faft ? Do
for -they, who give the Preiident even more ere- j â 
le- dit than he asks on so many occasions, doubt | Â«
lie him on thisâor have they better means of , (
in, information on this fubjeftâif they nave, t
tu- why has he not been made acquainted with '<
3e- it ? But he still thinks we may negociate, t
r il- and consequently eiitertains no immediate i
apprehension of a war ; this sentiment is ex- j 1
" a pressed in his speech, and it even makes a j 1
cal part of the report, and consequently those | '
ar- who support that part of the answer, cannot j i
of with propriety oppose the fame thing in the j '
na- amendment.
:he It is also charged against the amendment , 1
en- that it Concedes every thing and a Herts no- ' 1
na- thing ; now the impression which the amend- i
in- ' ment made on him was, that if any thing, it j
ent j took higher ground ; we all agree as to an
-so ; insult being given in the dismissal of our mi
ijo- : nifter, and in the amendment, while we leave
nan : open the ground for negociation proposed
ep-1 by the President, we declare that a repeti
up-.j tion of insult will put an end to every friend
hen I ly relationâand after all, this firm language â¢
go- is said to be degrading.
Mr. W. Smith begged leave to offer a j
ons (hort reply, he had been accused of indulg- j
rere ing a poetical flight, but the gentleman who |
itry accused him appeared himfelf in that parti, i
he cular to have been indulging a poetic li- j
und cense j he had talked of concession as if j
that France had not spoliated ; v> T e are not about
that to conclude a treaty of concession, but to i
ess enter 011 negotiation for a treaty of ftipula- ,
ter tions for equivalents ; if we are to ufurpthe .
the treatymaking power in this house, he hoped '
ich- would not forget to do something for A
:ors, mericaâ as to the poetical flight, he appeal
hes, ed to the recclleftion of gentlemen who-had
:sâ read Fauchet's letter wherein he pathetical- .
>und ly deplores the failure of the Weltern'infur- ,
vere reftion by a too early explosion. The gen- ,
us, tleman fays he is not disposed to make any
ithe concession, but is it not evident that force s
exists ; does this not invitelloftility, if we
, he fay we must concede : do we not admit by ;
t us this what France seeks, and if (lie' obtains S
t of one article of the Briti(h treaty by threats, 1
and may we ndt expeft to hear her demand all j
1 our the other articles by fmiilar meansâand !
f the the repeal of the law of 1794, and all her
ithin other insulting demands. The gentleman
tie e- had made another extraordinary discovery, j
; he that the Preiident seeks our advice, he deni- J
y na- ed it ; he gives us a narrative of the state of
here the Union, and he tells us he means to pur- ,
:cels sue negotiation, he calls you to defend your (
ffion country against external attacks, and to be ;
the prepared to repel them ; but here we work
Imed whole days in discussing business that does '
may not belong to us ; and perhaps in this great
juit revolutionary change cf constitution while
ne in we are thus employed the Senate may be
adily doing our duty and debating the means of
V.me- defence.

lould Amendment
lend- Friday,-June 2.
mnds [Mr. Harper was not surprised that the
to be gentleman last up (hould have so far -wander
nring ed from the fubjeft; nobody who knew him
to be would be surprised. From what he had said,
he (liould have thought the motion before
n va- the house had been a call upon the secretary
most of state for papers. The rcafon why the
>m S. papers the gentleman mentioned were not be
:r we fore them was, they had not been allied for.
Ke looked vvitWanM-spt upon whattV- !i
gentle man had said about thJ practice ot j
country courts ; he thought it indicative ot .1
his want of sense va&Tiod mimers. t
Mr. IvUtiedge wiflied to ma't: an Odfer- t
vation, which though not ftriftly la older, h
lie triifted he (houldbe permitted to make, t
as it was in reference to what had (alien from
the gentleman last up.
The Sptakt.r said he could not be pw- y
mitted to pivceed with remarks, not in or-, a
der. - ' f
Mr. W. Smith supposed that -as the gen- ji
tleman Irom Maryland-had bfeen permitted e
to make his observations, a reply to them .a
ought to be allowed. â  *" S
The Speaker said the remark of th: gen- J
tleman from S. Carolina was equally out of r
order. (He read the rule. ) The gentle- 1
tleman having set out with faying what he t
(hould offer Would not be in order, it was 'I
his duty to flop him. He (hould ash leave t
of the house for hrm to proceed. Leave
was a(ked and given.
Mr. "Rutledge observed, the gentleman r
had frequently called for documents with 1
refpeft to spoliations. The gentleman could 1
I not have Yead the documents on the table, 1
! without feeing major Mountflorence's papers !
jon that subject, which not only confirmed (
the taking of vessels, but also the refufc.ta- 1
tion of an* old law requiring the proteft'.on
of seamen to be countersigned by tfye offic- 1
erSjof government. âHe (hould vote against 1
the previous question ; but he was for leflcn
ing the evil aÂ» much as he could, which was t
a common course taken in passing of bills. 1
If the amendment was adopted, he (hould '
vote for the whole.
Mr. S. Smith answered that he had no- j
ticed the documents which had been men- '
tioned, when he was up the other day.
Mr. Craik thought there was no neceffi- 1
ty for farther proof of the spoliations com- '
mitted upon our commerce by the French
than they had before them. He thought it
right that the stipulation in favor of our ci- 1
tizens (hould be added, and that the attempt ]
to get rid of it by the previous question was
unfair, as a refufal to consider the subject
would amount to a juftification of the spo
liations, and to a denial to the right of our
citizeni to fatisfaÂ£lion. He denied that
there was any danger of a war in conse
quence of the French refuflng to make the
fatisfaftiori here mentioned ; nor -could he
corfceive gentlemen need to be alarmed for
the loss of the amendment proposed.
Mv. Nicholas said, it was his wi(h to
offer France the concession already agreed
upon, for the fake of peace, and at the fame
time to convince them that they had nothing
to expeft from any party in this country
(which it appears they had been led to..be
lieve) in support of any unjultifiable -claim.
The amendment which had Seen agreed to,
. ! he thought well calculated to produce this
as it declared what these Frenchmen'
7 , (as they had been stigmatized) were willing
to do ; but now gentlemen came forward
and wi(hed to tack another proposition to.
this, viz. that compensation (hall be made
. for spoliations committed upon our citizens.
. . It was not doubted that this was a proper
1 i fubjeft of negotiation ; but when they saw
; j the zeal which was (hewn by the executive
: ; in favor of our own claims, they did not
; i suppose these would be forgotten ; but they
i did think it possible frotn the complexion of
t ; the speech of the President, and the report
. | ed answer to it, that it was possible the con
. cessions which they had introduced might
t ' not be attended to. They wiflied, there
-1 fore, as they believed the. peace of the coun
. try depended upon it, to express their wilh
e es on that subject ; but if the fubjeft of fpo
i liations was introduced in the way proposed,
. it would be to fay, "we will have fatisfac
_ tion for spoliations, or we will not treat 5"
e i for said he, it is either a fine qua non, or it is
j not ; if it were, he apprehended war would
a j be the consequence ; if it were not, it could
â¢_ : not be ps any use, but would destroy the
0 claims of the merchants. He denied that
i. ! gentlemen averse to this proposition were a
j verse to obtaining redress for the merchants ;
;f â  their objeft was peace, and they did "not
lt ' wi(h to clog the negotiation with any thing
0 j which might prevent a continuance of bleff
j. - ings to our country.âMr. N. defended him
ie felf and those who voted with him from the
j i charge of btmg friends of France. He be-
L _ : lieved they could challenge gentlemen on
j. the other fide to. (hew that they had more
d reason to be attached to this country than
1_ , they, he thought their 'fortunes were as fa
r_ Lie and their domeflic comforts as great as were
thofe of other gentlemen,

s j Mr. Dana said he was perfeftly fatisfi
j ed with the vote whicK" he had given on the
1( j ; proposition for placing France on the fame
cr footing with other nations ; he notwith
ln ! Handing acknowledged the obligation he
j was under to those gentlemen who seemed
j to express solicitude at the dilemma in which
0 f they supposed those who voted for that
r _ question were now placed, However the
ur ' solicitude of gentlemen on this account was
be ' misapplied as to himfelf, as he did not wi(h
r k 'to evade a vote upon the main question. He
, es j (hould therefore vote against the previous
rt ' question.
ile j It had been said that if the proposition
be now proposed to be introduced was carried,
of it would be either pledging the house to go
'to war, or amount to a relinquilhment of the
claims of our merchants. If he thought
t's it would pledge them to go to war, if net
acceded to, he (hould be against it. The
question having been brought up, if 110 de
he cifion had upon it, it might be fuppof
er- edthat the house did not consider that any
im injury bad been done to oÂ» neutral rights,
id, t In cafe we were disposed to go to war, âif

our neutral rights, and lie hoped flte would

their lolfcs ; and he woutd have exprefFed
this hope, if the former amendment had not

prepokd amendment by rvfivGiMwie was a
just one ; it meant no more', be to
exprcfs'.a 4Â»opc that the French *.v<m:!d have
a difpofitiqh to "itiafcc the injuries done to
our neutral rights a filbjeiS of Htgociation.
They had often been told of the juflice and
magnanimity of the French tiatioft (hebe
lieved by thjij;.gentleman) ; and truited
they would not be so unjufi, so atrVcious, as,
â¢because we exgrefsa hope that they will da
this, to .make, war upon us.
Mr. Gallatis interrupted Mr. S. to
fay that he had never made use Of'ilich senti
ments ; he had never, spoke afThi French
making war upon us. fie r.Sver' said the
exprefling a hope would be an ultimatum.
He made two proportions of the question
(which he explained as before.)- He never
said any thing either about the'jufticc or
magnanimity of the French nation.
Mr. W. Smith said he would not inter
rupt the gentleman, because he expected
he would confirm what he had aflerted.
Mr. -S. said he was firft endeavoring
to (hew how far it would operate with
refpeft to France ; because, Jf that natiou
was so great and jtot as file was teported to
be, thei\t would brtio danger of war on her
part ; and he was going to (hew how far
war was likely to take place on our part.â
In order to support his argument, the gen
tleman must (hew that we pledged ourselves '
to go to war. There was no such thing,
and he denied that any such idea existed.
No .gentleman objected to negociate; nay,
it was known that a nomination had taken'
plaee abdve Hairs of negociators.
They were now, Mr. S. said, doing the
bufmefs of the other departments of govern
ment ; but, as it had been' so determined, /'
they must confiderthemfelvesas in their situ
ation. He therefore supposed that House
as forming a council to the Prcfident. He
supposed that the President might be in the
chair, and they .were -advising him how to
aÂ£t. He alked their opinion'. In the full
place, said he, we anfsver, you must con
cede to France the article refpedting free
(hips, '&c. Other gentlemen fay, that is
not all, you must fpeakof spoliations. They
fit .down, and begin to draw the articles of
inftrudtion for the' negociator,. They firft
mention the concefficm withrefpect to the
Britilh treaty ; but "fay other gentlemen, you
mull add a hope that payment will be made
for spoliations ; but they answer, no ; you
must not aftc France for this, that would be
an ultimatum.âThis, said Mr. S. would be
our fituationV' He denied however that such
a proportion was any-more than exprefling
a hope that the spoliations would become a
feature in the negociation.
Gentlemen alked why triumph id their
dilemma. There was no doubt, they were
in one ; they confeffed it. And why ? Be
cause they did not v. i.'h to make this claim.
Why did not they wife it ? It was difficult
to fay ; but they might conjecture, and he
believed it was, that to agree to fuchapro
â¢ position, would be to fay that there had been
injuries done to this country by France.â
â  Do they wifti te hold up an idea that France
â  is jullified in their ipqjiaticr.s ? Do they
â¢ think the conduft of . our Executive
â  has been such as to provoke them ? He
i hoped not ; though the conduit of some
â  gentlemen feemc-d to imply it. It would be
easy to (hew that this was not the cafe ; and
! he had to doubt that when our commifiion
' ers.came to make a candid explanation of
' that conduft to the French'government, there
â  would be a disposition on the part of France
t to make reparation.
But the gentleman from Maryland, said
; there was not many regular captures ; that
t tbe veflels taken were mostly going to rebel
> porie ; if so, they would be the easier com
- penfated.
Gentlemen allowed that the firft part of
: the proposition was what it ought to be ; but
-it -was improper to-fay any thing about fpo
â¢ liations. By this it appeared as if that house
e intented to entrap the Executive.âGentle
-1 men fay if you demand compensation for
â¢ spoliations, it will involve a war ; yet they
e expeft the Executive to, make a demand on
this head. Did not this hold out an idea
> that the House was for peace, and the Ex
ecutive for war ? He believed, though this
was not expressly said, it had all along been
'â < insinuated. We will usurp the right of
making a peace-proposition ; but we will
" throw the obloquy of the war proposition
c upon the Executive. We will hold out the
e olive branch ; but the Executive (hall bran
r di(h the sword !
e Mr. S. referred to themeafures of fequef-
tration and a prohibition of commercial in
k tercourfe which, were propofÂ«Lwhen Britilh
1 fpoliatione were complained of ; but now 4
e . he said, they were not to express a hope for
ls redress.
h With refpeft so. the fear of >var, Mr. S,
e afl;ed if, France were to fend an ag*:it ta
18 make a rtquifition upen then!, if the fame
arguments as were now u'fed would not ap
n ply ! Suppose, for iiiftarice, they fliould
1, want five millions cT dollare, and if ndt paid
;o within a certain tipt-' war would be made
le upon us. It might be said, why (hall we go
it to war about this ? One campaign would
;t cost more than all this. Would not such
le language as this, encourage them to make
e- a requisition upon us ?If they discovered our
f- utter want of spirit to Tcfcfit wrongs, they
:y might carry on a mockery of a negociation,
s. and in the mean time,let loose their cruifero
â if upon our commerce. In countries where
Id the French have armies, said Mr. S. they
c- can do all this and more. They fay you
be must raise us so many millions of money, and
ed such a quantity of fr.pplies by such a day ;
ly yciir.ruU do'tfcii-, or ;,;kc the cenfequence.If we wers ia th.*:r situation ZvrJjicK tlian!i j

Mr, B*knt decbcfd Lis intÂ«ition "of vo-
in favour of the previous quittibn, tho'
he h?d expreifed hit intention yesterday of
vutfng differently.; but, truce hearing the
acgnpientsof the gentleman from PennfyU <
rania,. and having himfelf seriously consider
ed tqe fabjjeft, lie was determined to vote
cgakft. now putting the main queftioa.
Mr. KITTEt.I faidheliadlctpt his feat with :
difficulty when he heard gentlemen speak of
this as an offenfiv* proposition to France ;
he thought to cberfi a doubt that they would
do justice, would be more likely to insult
thai nation. Many prefefuens he said had
been made with refpeft to wishing the peace
of the country to be preferred.* Immedi
ately reprefentmg people who enjoyed peace
Ã¼bovp every thing else, it would bt/ difficult
tÂ«KP?ke them believe he was not as sincere
in his profeffions for peace as any manâ
He Ueheved his proposition did not tend to
war but to peace. He thought the main
question ought now to be put, as the pro
position, carried without the amendment,
would carry a Itrongttnplication that this go
vernment was about to abandon the claims ef
her citizens. r
Mr. R. Williams should make no apo
logy for troublingthe house as was common,
as he conceived he had a rig'jt to expr'efs his
thoughts on this and every other question
presented to him. It was said that if the ]
present motion was not adopted, it would be
abandoning the rights of our fellow citizens,
this argument he supposed was used to
frighten members into a vote which they did i
"not v/ifii to give. He considered the nation <
as bound to protest its citizens in the legal ]
exercise of their business on the Ocean ; but i
if any other nation injured them, they were j
to look to their own government rr>r redress i
and not to the foreign nation. It was true, â 
the government had a right to look for fa
ti.tfadion for the wrongs. He did not there- i
fore consider this vote as in any degree inju-. ]
ring hi; fellow citizens. They did not at
present know the amount of the spoliations.
It v7ould be an after consideration, if they i
fnould not be paid, whether we will pay ,
them ourselves or go to war. Mr. W. took i
not 'ee of several argnments which had been i
used against putting the previous question ; i
he particularly observed upon the ftngular'tty \
of what fell from Mr. Otis, that he believ- ;
ed the principle wrong, and that such en- ,
croachments upon the Executive would lead i
him to fortify himfelf by corruption or force ; ;
yet he would vote for it.
Mr. Potter hoped the previous questi
on would not prevail. He trusted the Re
presentatives of the American people were
not prepared to give up the claims of their
fellow citizens without even alking for a fa
tisfaftion of them.
The previous queftjon was put in this form
" {hall the main question now be put."â

Wednesday, June 7.
Mr. Otii presented a petition fropi sundry mer
chants of Boftoa and Charltftown trading to Chi
na and Incia, praying for a fufpenfton tor a limit
ed time of certain duties imposed la(t fciion upon
tea and white cotton goods, intended to take pJace
from the firft of July aext, on the ground that it
was the intention of ihe Lcgiflaturc to exempt
frcra the duty the cargoes of all vefTels then on
tlicir voyages, \llsdging that their vessels required
a loiigei time to make their voyages thin vessels
from ionic. other ports of the Union-. Preferred to
a Select Committee of three.meaibcri.
Mr. W. Smith ;nÂ«ved that the House go into a
Committee of the whole on the Bill for prohibit
ing for a limited time, the exportation of arm.
and ammunition ; which it accordingly did, and
after receiving sundry verbal amendments, fugged- I
edbyivlr. Bayard, the committee role and the
house agreed to them. The kill was ordered to
be re-engrofled.
Theh<>ufe then refoJved itfelf into a Committee
ef the whoie on the State of the Union ; when
the third resolution, relating to the purchaJe of
ditional armed vessels, having been cead,
Mr. Sewall fabmitted it to the gentleman who
brought forward thafe resolutions, whether it
would net be bitter to poftporie a determination
upon the third and fourth resolutions, until the
fifth was difpoicd Â©f; feeeaufe if it were agreed to,
it might have'an effeA upon the vote of gentle
men upon the ether two, 2Â« they might be of o
pinion that if the merchant* vessels were armed,
there would be no necemty for a convoy.
Mr. W. Smith had np obje&ion to postpone
the coniideration of the third aMd fourth resoluti
ons for the present, in order to take up the fifth.
Mr. Nicholas supposed this could not be done
except the gentleman chose to withdraw the third
and lourth resolutions.
Mr. W. Smith said it might be done by gene
val coiifent.
Mr. Giles could not confentto depart frorrt the
plan of difcuflion laid down by the gÂ»ntlenian
S-Carolina. his part he ftiould voti a
gaiull the whoie of the resolutions, and trusted a
maturity of the committee would do io : and he
did itot wifo the decision to be delayed He wifh

Mr. Ofis could not fee how it was materrfl to

jt&Was of opinuTn with hi* colleague that it would

au-i he ihougfct it would be unclndid to objeA to
the poftponcment. The Senate had already passed
a law on the 3d and 4th, and thofc might as. well

Mr. W Smith said he (houlJ adopt a mode,
which wculd net retire the confentÂ«f gentlemen.
He withdicw.for the preknt, the third and fourth

have considerable weight in iniiueoceing his vote.

It might afterwards undergo luch ni<jÂ®ifuÂ»tioi!s as <
should be found ncctffary. > ;
Mr. Livingston said the gentleman from 1
Pennsylvania liad very properly enquired i
what was the scope of the present refolutiQn, 1
and he expected some answer would have <
been given. The gentleman frcm S. Caro- ]
lina had said, they mult vote for the princi- 1
pie, and the detail would come of course. 1
So that without knowing its object, wheth
er it was defenfive or offenfive, they were i
called upon to agree to the principle. This 1
deficiency had been supplied in some degree, 1
by the gentleman from New York. He 1
fays the merchants have undertaken to arm ]
their veflels. He wiflied to know whence 1
he derived his information i The only in- '
formation before them was the President's I
speech, where he fays he has forbidden â 
such armament, except in the East India i
trade. He therefore supposed the faÂ£t not 1
founded. What, he aiked, was intended
to be done with these armed vessels ? He 1
said they mull argue hypothetically. He
supposed they were intended to protect our 1
trade. He did not believe they were meant '
to operate offtnlively. But he would a(k, 1
if this were the cafe, if it would not lead '
diredtly to war ; since individuals would be '
left to determine the law of nations, and of '
course the peace of the countiy would be '
placed at their disposal, and all precautions, '
on the part of government, tvould be in 1
vain,fince individuals,who might have an op- ]
pofite interest to that of government, â 
might be continually committing atts of '
holtility.
Who, said Mr. L. are our merchants ? 1
Were they all men in whom implicit confi- 1
dence could be placed T~Were they all Amt- 1
ricans ? He believed the generality of them 1
might be welldifpofed towards the intereits j 1
of this country : but if there were one man j 1
of a contrary spirit, the peace of the coun- j (
try would be at his disposal; for what would j 1
avail all the inftru&ious which were gives, if '
one foreigner had the power to commit aÂ£ts 1
of hostility on a power with whom we are '
at peace ; and if government were to difa- ;
vow violations of this fort, yet a repetition 1
of them would certainly involve the country
in a war. And when it was considered what
a number of Englijb and French we had a- :
mongft us, who would wish to fee this coun- 1
try take part in the present war, it would
not be extraordinary, if they should seize
such an opportunity of provoking hostilities
with one or the other, power. For his own
part, be looked upon the meafurfe in so seri
ous a light, that he should not hesitate to
fay, he should prefer a Declaration of IVar,
to such a step, because it would be a derelic
tion of principle, thus to commit into the
hands of they knew not whom, that most
sacred trust, the preservation of the peace
of the country ; whereas, if war were to be
declared, we.should put onrfelves into a state
of defence accordingly. A measure of this
kind taken under the rnalk of peace, would
be plunging a dagger into the vitals of the
country, from which it would be a long
time in recovering. Mr. L. concluded, by
remarking upon the extraordinary manner
in which this business was condufted, and at
tributed the withdrawing of the 3d and 4th
resolutions to a persuasion that they would
have been negatived, if persisted in.
Mr. S. Smith acknowledged that the
present was a very delicate fubjett; but had
not the President forbidden the arming of
merchant vefTels, he should have been of o
pinion that the merchants vessels of a neutral
power had always a right to arm for their
own defence. But he believed it was neces
sary that something should be done. Mer
chants would arm their vessels from the right
given to them by the law of nations, and, if
not restrained, might go on to do aÂ£ts which
could not be juflified. Though he believed
merchants poffefTed the right of arming their
velTels ; yet, rather than do any thing which
would involve the country in war, he believ
ed they would desist from the praÂ£tice, and
bear the lofTes which they might, for the
want of arms, fuffer. , He moved to flrike
out the word regulating," and to insert
in the place of it " reflricting in certain ca
ses."
Mr. Swan wiCK believed it would be very
difficult to devise any plan by which to reg
ulate a power of this kind, since private in
terest was set to work to evade the law.
There had always been great difficidty to
pfeventprivateersfrom being fitted out in-our
ports, and it was known that many of the
vessels employed against our trade in the W.
Indie 3, notwithstanding the precaution, had
I been fitted out in our ports, and whenever
pcrmiflion was given to merchants to arm
, their vessels, that pcrmiflion would be a cover
â¢ for a variety of abuses. Besides, the arm
' ing of vefTels, Mr. S. said, would be atten
ed with an expense which no regular trade
could support. If it were not for this, na
â¢ tiou&at w? . might carry on trade, as well as
neutral nations. He looked upon the advan
tages which the \Jnited States had derived
, from their trade to be owing to their having
â¢ carried it on without the necessity of arming j
â¢ this provision, therefore, could have no oth
' er effect, than to involve us in war. What,
Jie asked, had been the conduit of other neu-
I tral nations .' He did not believe Denmark,
: Sweden, or Venice had carried guns on
> board their merchant veflels, though they
had had very considerable commerce. He
believed that the only proper protection for
. the trade of a nation wa* the armed fottf 'of
the government, which would always be un-
ier tide regulations. Fct tliefe reafor.s, lft :
hould be o)Â»pofcd to the present measure.
Mr. Gallatin said, it feemcd as if the
notion of the gentleman from Carolina
â vr.s. fufc-ptibl; cf any fhaps, since the 3-
nendmenf now incorporated into :t, seemed
;â > hvft a different view, from the original;
At p-fent, he would state hi* c'tjeCiionn to '
:h-! principle of the refohtfioa itfelf. The
firft enquiry was, whether the law of n=i- 1
:ions permitted the merchant veiTck of a neu- 1
:ral nation to arm. If they had not a right 1
to permit it, whether they are not bound 1
:o prohibit it. He had examined the law
>f nations on this subjeCt, and,found no such 1
mthority, nor did the practice of modern 1
:imes juflify the praCtice. He took a view 1
>f the different stages of society to shew,
:hat whenever regular governments were
:ftablifli<d, the public defence wa. always 1
placed in them, and it was their duty to pro- j :
:eÂ£t individuals, since they did not give them 1
leave to proteCt themselves.
Mr. G. said he knew of no exception, but â¢
:n cases of letters of marque and reprisal, and '
ie did not know a single instance within the
aft century, where these had been granted, '
Dut war had been the consequence, so re- 1
pugnant were they to the present state of 1
ociety.âlt was true nations might be ih 1
uth a state, to find it necessary to grant '
uch a power ; as when a nation with which
:t has to do is unable to support the common '
-elations of intercourse. Two inftancesof 1
-his kind presented themselves, viz.âthe 1
East-India trade, and the Mediterranean !
-rade. In carrying on our trade with the 1
East-Indies, our vessels were met by those 1
sf a number of uncivilized powers, wpon ;
â vhom no restraint could be had, so that no '
emedy was left to us, but immediate re- i
iftance. - Nearly of the fame nature was the '
ituation of the Barbary powers in the Me- 1
iiterranean ; and although we enter into a 1
:reaty with them, we have not a perfeCt re- '
iance upon their obfervihg their engage- j '
nents, our merchants vessels are, therefore, 1
) emitted to trade to those parts armed- '
tie knew it might be said, that at present, 1
he Weft-Indies were in a similar situation. '
tie believed in some respeCts they were; and '
his could be the only plea for adopting a
neafure like the present. If it were to be J
inderftood that there was to be an end of '
;he negociating with France, or that the '
privilege of arming would not be abandoned, '
t might be proper to authorise the arming l
>f merchants vessels ; but he believed, if it '
vere considered that such a permission would '
je almost certain to involve us in a war, it
would appear to be much more wife to await '
:he event of the negociation with France by :
1 measure of this kind, but he was-afraid of '
involving our country iu a war. '
Mr. G. observed, that when he said it
svasour jiuty to prohibit the fitting out of 1
irmed merchant vessels, he thought we ow- 1
:d it to our own security to do so ; and as
the President had told them that he had !
prohibited the fitting out of any such vessels
until the will of Congress was known upon
the subjeCt, he saw no danger that could
arise from vessels still remaining unarmed.
And if-there were any merchants vessels ar
ming, he believed it would be best for go
vernment to remain silent on the subjeCt ; for
then, if merchants proceeded to aCts of hos
tility, government might disclaim the aft,
and they alone would have to answer for
them. Mr. G. concluded by faying, that
this being a new subjeCt, he (houid be glad
to hear what, could be said in flftor of it, or
of any historical faCt which could throw light
upon it.
Mr. Coit complained of the proposition,
when .firft introduced, and now amended,
being very indefinite. He thought the pro
vision fliould be made, but he wished the ob
jeÂ£t to be defined: He could not fay that
he could-fo modify the resolution, that he
could himfelf vote for it ; he had not made
up his mind npon the subjeCt as to what ca
ses restriCtions should be'made ; but, in or
der to take the sense of the committee, he
would move an amendment, in order to
bring the subjeCt before them. It was to
strike out " c#rtain cases," and to insert at
the end of the resolution " bound to the Eajl
Indies and to the Mediterranean."
.Mr. Harper proposed to amend the a
mendmen, by adding the word " Weft,"
after " East," so as to read " East and Weft
Indies."
Mr. W. SjniTH did not think it material
whether Weft-Indies was inserted, or the a
mendment was rejeCted altogether. It was
his wish that the committee should firft have
decided upon the abstraCt principle. Pre
suming it to be the existing law of this coun
try that merchants have a right to arm their
vessels, he wished to know whether it was
their wish to interfere in regulating and re
striCting that right. He believed the modi
fication of the business might very well have
been done in the bill. He would have risen
before to have given his reason for this, had
he not been prevented from doing so by gen
tlemen who had complained that he had not
done it. He was in favor of the amend
ment to the,amendment ; but, if it was not
carried, he would be againlt the amendment.
It would be in vain to take into confedera
tion the East India and Mediterranean trade,
when spoliations were principally committed
in the Weft Indies, when, indeed, the ob
jeCWof the present meeting of Congress, was
principally to take into consideration the
protection of the Weft India and European
trade : he presumed, therefore, if they meant
to do any thing effectual, they ffy>uld take
into Weft India trade.âr-
Gentlemen were very ready, he said, to ob
jeCt to every plan brought forward, but they
themselves proposed nothing. All they (}id
was to hold out alarms of war, though eve
ry one expressed a desire for peace.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
Swanwiek) had objeCted to the arming of
merchant vessels, because of the expence.â
He believed the merchants of the United
States in general thought differently, tho'
there might.be some merchants in this city
who would be averse to the measure. As
to the expence, he believed, the expence of
fitting out the vessels, would Le mcfe tKati â 
Caved in the insurance. But there was z fur- 1
ther confederationâbj T 'his means the vcf
fels and fe?,men would be prcferved to the
United States ; wherias, "if -it wereput. a,4
dopted, we not only 'loÂ£e out - reflets- anil !

. Something had been said about the con
2uCt of other neutral nations. He believ
ed they had armed their merchantmen, â
though he did not pledge himfe-lf to prove
it; but if this were not the cafe, they had
fleets to convoy their trade. We, on the
:ontrary, had no fleet, nor did gentlemen
!eem disposed that we should have any,â
mce they have exprelfed faeir willies that
the frigates now building were burnt. He
iflced what was to become of the commerce
jf this country, if we refufed to proteCt it ?
If we were to resort to an embargo, what
.you'd be the consequences ? You would
lot, said he, fuffer your vessels to lay up for
:ver. After a time, they would be sent
jut again. In cafe of an embargo, what,
ie asked, would become of our seamen ?
rhey would vender about the country, dif
:ontented, and peri thing for want. What
would become of our produce ? It would
â ot upon our wharves.
The gentleman from Pennfylva.iia (Mr.
Gallatin) had not said neutral nations had
lot a right to arm their merchant's ycffels,
md he had no doubt, if he could have done
the would. Was it, then, right for us to
It still and fee the property of our mer
:hantÂ» spoliated, Was it not our duty to
sroteCt our commerce, our merchants, our
-evenue ? If we were to fuffer these to be
aid waste, when thÂ«tt state of things arriv
:d which he believed was not for distant, in
vhat a situation should we bt;.! Nay, he
jelieved that the conduct of gentlemen on i
:hat floor would have the effeCt to increase 1
he demands of France upon us, by con- j
rafting her means and our weakness.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania had
uftified our right to arm merchant; vessels
:o the East Indies and the Mediterranean,
)ut had introduced some nice distinCtions to
hew that,the fame reason did not exist for,
trming our Weft India vessels ;.but lie could
ec no reason for it in one cafe, which did
lot also exist in the other. j
But he was furprifedt'nat the gentleman
hould have treated so cavalierly our good I
illy the Dey of Algiers, who had behaved
o very politely and generously to us. â¢ He
:hought much more respeCt was due to the
Dey than to Viftor Hugues, though that
jentleman did not seem to speak of him with
equal respeCt, The Dey of Algiers had
lent 40,000 dollars to our agent for the
purpose of making a treaty with Tunis.â
Victor Hugues, on the contrary, took all
he could get from us.
Unless some means of protecting our
vessels was determined upon, our coasting
trade would be loft, since the Picaroons had
been off the Capes of the Delaware. And
if they were to know, that Congress had
adjourned, without doing any thing for our
protection against them, our coast would
fwarni with them.
But gentlemen were afraid, if our vessels
went to the Weft Indies armed, war would
be the consequence. â  He did not think so.
He believed France conlidered all that part
of the country as outlawed, and that it had
little connexion with the Government of
the country, Indeed, he knew it as a faft,
that the French Minister had allured our
Government, before he left Philadelphia,
that the spoliations committed in the Weft â 
Indies were unauthorized ; and, therefore,
if no means of defence were taken against j
them, we could have 110 ground upon which
to expeCt redress from France.
But gentlemen said, why take these mea
sures at present, since they may be looked
upon as hostile, while our negociation is
pending ? He believed, that after the pre
sent dispute should be adjusted with France,
ic would be necessary to arm our vessels tra
ding to the Weft Indies, as he believed, for
some years to come, these buccaneers of va
rious colours, would continue to infeft those
seas. And if this were the Cafe, why ought
they not to go into arming our vessels at
present, when they were met fo'r the purpose
of taking effectual measures for the defence
of our country.
Mr. S. Smith conceived that Congress
were called together to adopt such meafurcc
as were best calculated to preserve the peace
of the country, by means of negociation,
and to fix upon fush means of defence as
would not be injurious to the
was his-opinion that the Prefideut was not
authorised by law to prevent the vessels of
merchants being armed ; but the merchants
of the United States would readily submit
to any loss rather 1 than go to war. He knew
that this was the opinion of the Philadel
phia merchants; he had seen many of them.
Nor had he met with one native American
who wished to go into this arming plan ;
it would infringe our neutrality,
and throw us into a war. When he came
here, his mind was scarcely made up on the
subjeCt ; he did not like t* give up his right
to defend his property ; but he had found
this to be the general opinion, and therefore
he brought forward the amendment, which
had been well amended by the gentleman
from Connefticut. The gentleman from
South Carolina had since added Wejl Indies,
and this brought them to issue ; jor it was
â¢war, ox not -war. â
