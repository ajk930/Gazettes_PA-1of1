is a rare phcenomenon.

Celebration of
The President's Birth Day.
The Citizens of Portsmouth, paid a most
honorable teftimqny of refpedl to the Birth
day of the President of the United States,
in the following verV}judicious manner : fit
fun rife a federal faiute was fired from the
Revenue Cutter, commanded by John \-
darns, Esq. which faiute wis returned by
a jovful ptal from all the bells ; by Major
Boyd's private armed ship, and from two
brass field pieces centrally disposed in Cant.
Whidden's garden. At to a. m. the 'right
Infantry, under the orders of Thomas Spar
hawk, Efq paraded at the State-Houfe v
and after peiformi'-g a variety of military
evolutions in a very fiiperior llyle, marched
out of town, to escort his Excellency Gov
GILMAN in, wo had previoufiy been
invited to honor an elegant entertainment
with hs pretence, which had been provided
by his fellow citizefis at the aflembly room.
The military escort and his excellency met
at the confines of the town, when, with
that diftingui/hyl politenef; which marks the
charafter of the fuiifhed gentleman, he in
stantly dismounted, and placed himfelf with
the line of Infantry, and in thii manner was
condu&ed to his lodgings at Col. Brewfter's;
his arrival being announced by 16 rounds of
artillery At 3, /. m. the military resum
ed the line of march, and waited on his Ex
cellency to the place .of entertainment,
where they displayed files, saluted, fired a
ftu de jdye and wÂ«re difmifled. A few mi
nutes pall 3, his Excellency entered the
room, Â£Thomas Martin, Esq. afiin,r as
President, and Col. James Sbeafe as Vice-
Prelident,] and participated oF a dinner
which did honrror to the ftewardsa id reflec
ted equal credit on Mrs. Whidden, whose .
abilities were never displayed to more advan
tage. His Excellency was attended by his
fuitc and followed -by the Re*. Clergy.
Among whom we noticed Dr. Tappan, the
Hollifian profefTur of D vinity at Cambridge
and many other diftinguilhcd characters
A great number of the militia officers, join
ed the escort ii complete uniform. What
rendered the prefruce of his Excellency pe
culiarly grateful to his fellow citizens at this
moment, was. that he had jull completed
bis personal review of the militia through
out the slate, and returned in perfect health
to the affections of a people, who appreci
ate his talents, and revere his virtues.
After dinner a number of federal and pa
triotic loalls were given out, and the follow
ing original and moll excellent songs sung
with liiyh approbation. The company a
mountir.g to nearly fro, broke up at an ear
ly hour, and retired with that dt-conim,
which so well become* men who acknow
ledge thcnifelves the citizens of a federal re
public, which gave birth to the illustrious

vate, than immortalized by his public vir

OS. 13.PROPOSALS,
BY THK
Insurance Company rfNtrtb America.
For Insurance againlt Fim, on Rwelling-
Houses, Ware-Houses, and other Buildings (and
on Good* contained in such Buildings) distant from
Philadelphia, in the United States.
I Common lufurancet, on hazards of the Srft
class, will be undertaken at a premium of ahout
hal! per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous
rifques a larger premium will be required, which
will vary according to circu*ftances, feidom ex
ceeding one per rent, pc- annum ; but in some in
stances, where the property insured is not only in
itfclf extra hazardous, but rendered il ill morefo
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and
occupations, the premium demanded will be raised
according to eireumftances.
Houses and Ware-Houses, the walls and parti
tion? of whioh are wholly of (lore or brick, well
conftruCled, so as to bÂ» guarded as well as may be
against fires from within, and tree from extra ha
zardous buildings and occeupatlons in their neigh
borhood, will be deemed hazardous of the firft
class, and may be insured ta theirfull value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not ol *1 extra
hazardous kind, in casks, bales, or packages, de
pofired in ftich buildings, to an ameunt not ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; but if more than this fnm
is required to be infuroi-l in one tenement, an addi
tioÂ«al premium willbc required, in proportion to
circnmftances.
11. lnfurances will also be made on buildings and
goods i-'xtra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to tho risque. But it is not easy to arrangf these
uader particular heads or dalles, so as to dt feribe
eai.h v itb the necessary accuracy. Each caf must
therefore be decidedupon accordingto the circum-
Oaecesa'fnding it ; and these eireumftances wili,
in general, appear from the defcriptii.n accompa
nying t'-eapplication.
Buildings partly conftruCtrd of brick or flotie,
are preferable to those wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the stile of building, how they are oc
cupied, haw they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how ortupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And with rcfpeS tÂ® goods,
their tendÂ«ncy, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, ether
so commence or to increase an accidental fire, afld
their liability in such (late to receive damage by
wet, or by fuddenardhafly removal, or to lu: lio
len in time of cor.fuficn and hurry, are all cir
eumiUnCesor weight ; and the premiums must be
proportioned accordingly.
111. The following conditiont are to be uader
ftoodly the parties.
lie. The Insurance is net binding till the stipu
lated premium be paid ; but it (hall be deemed ef
fectual from the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately
signed or not.
2d. lnfurances may be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
per.fe* than the payment of ths premium of the re
newed term, tho eireumftances continuing the fame
as they were underflood by the Insurers at the time
the former insurance was made ; but the payment
of the premium is essential t# such reirewal; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; nor can the ipfurance be renew
ed on the former policy but by competing the
commencement of the renewal frem the expiration
of the former insurance. The fubjeCl of insur
ance may nevertheless be open-to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. If any other insurance be made on the fame
property ; it mull be made known at the time of
application, othdrwift the policy made on such ap
plication will be void.
4th .Goods hÂ«ld in trull, or on consignment,
isay M insured as such in a separate policy ; but
tilt) tire not tube considered at insured ethervuife.
jth. This corop*tiy will not be liable or accoun
table for any loss or damage occasioned by any for
eign invasion, or by any military or ufu. ped force
or by PLvfon of any civil commotion ; or occasion, â¢
ed by gunpowder, aquafortis or other thing of th
like kind kept in the building, or amongst the pro
perty insured.
6th. Bilk of' Exchange, Bonds and other Secu
rities, Title Deeds, Money, Bank and other pro
miffary Notes, are not included in any infarln.ee;
nor are paintings, medals, jewels, gems, antique
â¢uriofitias, or mirrors exceeding the value of twen
ty rfive dollars each, to be considered as insured une
less particularly mentioned aud by special agree
ment.
7th. No ir.furanee will be made for a Siorter
term than one year, nor for a longer term than fe- â¢
veil years. Persons choosing to infuse for seven
y.ars (ball b eallowed one year's premium by Way
of difeount: One third of a yearsprenitom fball
be abated in like manner an insurance for
three years.
Bth. Losses sustained by (Ire property injured,
fliall be paid in thirty days after due proof and li
quidation thereof, without deduction.
A defciiption of the property to be infurod will
be expired with each application, to be made by
a mafi r carpenter and signed by him, as well as
iy tlvi owner of the building on applicant for in
aÂ«rawcÂ«, and attested before a Notary or principal
Magiilrate, who will ceÂ«ify his knowledge of the
parties and their credibility.

TO BE LEASED FOR A TERM OF TEARS.
TO be leafed, for a term not kfs than three,
nor mote than seven years, a V ALUABtIE
PROPKRTY at the Seneca-Falls, in the county of
Onondago, 1 ndftato of New-York, on the Banks
of the Seoeca-river, two miles weft of the Cayttga
ferry, and eleven miles east of Geneva.
This eflabliffiraent consists of an cxcellertr grift
mill, sawmill, dwelling house, harp, and apart
age or carrying place, with between thirty and
forty aires of land, under good improvement, and
as much more in the vicinity, as maybe required
for foture.improvement.
Thf? frill mill is a handftfme', new and well fin
ifhed building, of jo by 30 feet, 3 llo'riei high
and furtiilhcd with 3 run of excellent Burr ft'ones
and another of Sfopns' floncs, of the bell quality
--and the molt approved boÂ«lts; &c. calculated to
.make ail the different qualities' of flour for expor
tation or for home comumption : Itisacceffxble by
water from every part of the Cayuga lake ana Se
neca-river, as well as from the Seneca-lakeâand
from its situation, commands a weryextenfive and
encreafing custom : The stream on which it (lands,
1 being the outlet of the Seneca-lake, the mill cau
never be in want of water ; and as it has been kept
working during the fevcreft season of the last win
ter, it is not liable to be impeded by froft :
The sawmill is also new, fitaated on the fame
stream, now furnifhed with an ample stock of
logs, of which a supply may at all times be pro
cured by lan 4 or water, of tlje bell quality :
The dwelling house is well calculated for the use
of the miller, is new, and fufficiently laige : The
barn is about 40 feet square, and entirely new i
The portage is 3-4thsof a mile in length, along
the Seneca-fallsâover which were passed in the
last year, nearly two hundred boats with their
contents ; this objeiSl is already productive of a
handsome income, which niuft be increasing and
permanent:
Among the mlny advantages of thisfituation,
tauft be numbered trie fertility o'f the furronnding
countryâbeing the best improved part of the coun
ty of Onondagaâthe concentration of inter
cosrfe by land and water, the Geneffee ftateroad
palling through it, as well as all water carriage to
Grnevaj and the counties of Ontario and Steuben ;
which renders it's mod eligible (land for a Store or
\ TavernâThe river and lakes abound in (ifh and
\ fowl, and the country with deer and other game.
Besides the milU already eretfled at this place, it
is calculated for any additional water works that
! may be found necessaryâFulling mill, bark mill
. tannery, forges, &c. may be erecSted at a small ex
| penceâlron ore may be brought ia boats from the
1 Cayuga lake ; and it is thought to abound in the
neighborhnod.
The flock, on hand w : ll be fold to the lessee, and
the cattle, utensils, smith's forge, See. may be fold
or let the premises.
If a purckafe (hould offer for the whole or an
undivided part of the premises it will be fold.
