â¢ Stafonable and candid Thoughts on Party. m

Many perfonslameMeur party divisions, and wilh f

ml â become a perse* being, and perhaps never
,u -hi t# be, while government newt* ro be watched, ]q
and liberty iÂ» worth witching trr
It is therefore rather unrrtlonahle, if not chi d
ifll, to lament the nidncc: 0 party-it Â» the U 01
of those who are free, and liberty, m
â¢ Umijb, is a million timet better than iLvi.ry. c<
der a defpotifin, there ara no parties â¢
Party is ncceffary and ofeful to watch ruler Â»- ,
Power Uan edge tool, and wild cat and wound ol

keeb it harmless in thefcabbard. Ao lnjivi.ua ,

aSivc and iiittreftcd proteflor. Indeed, without
pal ty at there never hoi been any libert}, 11
proline there never â will be-n would be too much w
to get rid of both. Nothing lcfs keen and clear
. sighted than party, would ferutinixe public men
,nd mealures as they ought to be.
uis not pretended that party frint.. not an e- T
,il j but it has some good tendency and irfluence. p
AH pirties are not equally similar. Such as go a
to the very bottom of th- principles of our govern
ment, and try to dig op the foundation ttonea, are al
neflilent. 1 here is a great difference between op- tl
prfition to the and the mufure, of a #
and a revolutionary llrife again#He be,n Z . Yet such D
is the objeA of the anti-federahfts. 1 hey are not
numerous, but they exist. Ihe nature ot certain w
amendment, proposed by Virginia, for the coiifti- â
tution is a demonstrative proof o( their exiftcnce, a)
which i. well proved aifo by other circumflance.. â
A party fubfervtent to foreign influence, is alio v
uniformly mifehievousâ Â»â¢ good can torn.Â«Â«<of itâ
it well deserves the name of faOion, and is the woi ft o|
form of the word thing in the world. Ihe two p
e r(at parties in our country mutually eall each otk- h|
*r Freach and Britilh ; and as far as ihefe words of
reproach go, they are even.
But the cafe between thu two parties is not j.ite
even. For the French partizars r penly avow tiicir
love for Frsnce ; and aff.rt that we are bound in fe
rratitude and justice to make great facrifices to her Â«
cause. It has not yewppeared thut any can be, in pi
their opinion ho grJ. While France wage, a pri- ol
vateerine war upon our trade, they juftify her, and ci
coDi'ernn our own country and government. Many
of them evsn dec:arc, that they would join the
Franch, if they (ho'jld laud here to invade usâ
which is uniuaiSaH* on every principle.
Those charged with being British partisans, oil
the contrary, to a man, deny the Charge. Whin t j.
Britain so outragroufiy wronged us in 1794, not K
one of them jnftitied her.âln oafe Mr. Jay strea- ct
tv had failed, they said we mull fight her. They N
aifc express their fears of a too close connexion s ,
with England, f wefhould hive to fight France.
If, however,"any of this lad dcfc'ription berÂ«-
ally liritifh panizans, they are to be defpif>d and
tlctcOfd. Prijbabiy they are few. C
Ca*dTalio demands the acknowledgment, that
many of the peifons charged w ' th being too zea
lous (or jFiance, love their own country, and would
net knowingly twind itshappy conilitution l'heir
infatuation tor the ""J' Â°f Frmeb liberty
has blinded manv very good cyts, and perverted
many hofteft hearts. The honeit m nof the party,
hevweves wiW own that,*h<ry ar< not in good com- S
pany, as some "of the party are both ant -ledcral
and Frenchified. '1 hey ought to turn their backs |,
on such with abhorrence. 5
The dread of the power of government is call
ed f>y many a wife jcaloufy. however, is a f
hli.J pat Con, as well as a llrong r:.c. Ihis at least, j f
it clearvthe mod enlightened daffes of our cm
fens are friends to the government. As they are
likely to fee the danger as soon at others, it is also
certain that no clali of citizen;, have more-to loft by
lofiti" such agevernment as will protest liberty and
property For, let it be obl'crved, that the firil
and furefl fac.ific* that arbitrary power is known
i'o require i$ firoberty. The wealthiest anJ befl in-
fo.med part of our citizens, and probably by far
the greatefl number, are attached to our conditu
tion and govtrnment. If then our governeient be j
really progreffinr toward# tyrannny, as its enemitÃ
fay, the federa supporters of it are in a miterable
rrror; as their interells and wishes are opposed to
iueh a progress ; an error that calls for all the pity
of the candid among the opposite patty, the fede- *
ralids being thole wh 1 wili fufTtr fir ft, and fuffer
mod, by the introdudion of arbitrary power.â
One party or the other it no doubt in such an error.
Each really thinks the other it wrong. Now
â¢which of the two parties it mod likely to be mida
kenâthe wealthy and thelea.-ned, the merchants,
the clergy, the ui.iverfities, the governors (except
one) ferates aud majorities of affemblics, from Vir
tadv&rd, who admire and support our govern
ment, or the discontented and complaining he ned
nien, few in number; seven eighths of whom are
to be found in the citieiof Philadelphia, New-York
and Boston, who oppose and condemn our public
roeafuret ?
Let every man, notwithstanding, use all the
sense and underdanding he has, and forhcar to pin
his faith blindly on the flceves of theft richand dig
nified people. But at the fame time it is fair and
proper to allc him, when he foes such characters
opposed to hit prejudices, to ufc all the candor and
"judgment he potftffes, before he allows himfelf to
withdraw his affections and lervice* from the con
stituted authorities of his own cotlntry, and attach
es himfelf to one that inl'ults, plunders and wrongs
it.
TKcfo fails are mentioned, aÂ»d these remarks are
fuggeOad with a view to abate the mutual bitter
ness of honed minds an both fidts Ths writer
doetnot di Â«y for a moment that he is naloufly at
tached to the American cjnditutiou and adminis
tration. But he has brought into its proper place,
at far as hÂ« wat able, every confederation that will
tend to vindicate those who differ from him in opin
ion.
One remark more should not be forgotten In a
time of danger, and iu a threatening crisis of af
flirs, liketheprefent, honed men of all parties should
unite for a timeâ(and it is only in such a time
that partiot can unite) âand by leaving the British
agents, if any such there be, and the servile toolt
of France, in a very small minority, and in merit
ed contempt, afford to government at lead a tempo
rary confidence and atd. The time callt for itâ
at by the appearance of union among hened citi
*eni, and meafurcs of energy in congreft, our
peace, our property, and our national independence
ray evenyethc preserved.
NEW-YORK : March j.
At this crisis of our affairs, when it ap
pear* probable that, after all our efforts to
preserve peace, we 111 all be driven to an o
pen rupture with France, it is a most conso
ling conitdcration, that the differences of
opinion in cur country are yielding to the
preffureofcircumftances, and to a conviftion
of the utter impolGKility of maintaining a
free gÂ»*ernnient, ander the influence of the
irreligious and anarchical principles of
modern theoretical pbilufophcrs. The en-
rVifiafra with which the principles of Ro
f eiu and have been embraced m
France, England and America, is a proof
how much more easily men are led by their
wi/hes and their feelings than by J B<l g I " en * CJ
and experience. But the terrible d.fafter- fe|
that have befallen France, and which threa- g .
ten this country, have brought a furpnz- bl
,'ngr change in men's minds on the fubjedt ot
govemmcnt. Th.' advocates of pure de- e,
mocracy, of reason and morality,
and maintained by education, independent
of a religious system, are every where ahan- o
doning their belief in those principles, and â
clinging to ancient institutions for political t ]
order and fafety. There x is even dang er t;
the hatred of the schemes of visionary a hi- f'
lofophers, may become too violent, and from
a natural vibration of the human mind from
one extreme to another, men may lean so n
much to old habits and opinions, ai to dil p
courage attempts at rational improvements p
These remarks are the result of careful f
observation on a late journey fro si Nev- - v
Yoik to Boston. A great increase of union
In favor of our adminiflration is every where f
visible ;and the foreign nation that attacks r
the Northern States, will find them firm and e
unanimous.

PARIS, January 8.
The greatest cire has been taken by govern

before its execution. Every municipality in I
the republic had received sealed bundles, with
orders not to open them until the 15th in the
morning, in the presence of the justices of
peace, commiflioners of the police, &c. (
We arc yet ignorant of all the particulars ref
pefling the seizures which have been made ; we ]
can snlv de lare, that, in general, they have
been considerable, in various magazines ot the â¢
streets of Luxembourg, of the Palace Egalite,
those of St. Dennis,&e. &c- The aftfaifliment
will cease, when we contider that the law of the
tcth Brumaire, was considered as delusive, and
when we call to mind that it strikes the follow
ing obje^s:
j. All kinds of cotton velvets ; all fluffs and
woolen clothi, whether made of cotton or hair,
wholly or mixed ; all quiltings, dimities, non
kinets, and mufhne s, spun woolens and cot

On the day when a feareh was made of Eng
lish goods, J.Aymer, frightened at the military
preparation, which was made on the octafion,
wishing to leave Paris, was known 'nd seized at
the barriers.
The English goods confiscated the last [earch
made at Paris, are estimated at nearly three
millions. Although it be known that one of
the best means ef redueing our tenacious enemy
is to prevent the cirenlation of its goods, yet we
cannot avoid wishing that the measures taken
for that end be such as rather to prevent their
introduction, than:# f'cize them when they are
introduced. BeGdes the inconveniences rcfult
lf ing fiom the inquifiterial visits, which are ne
cessary, it is evident that the hurt falls more
immediately on our citizens,than on our enemy,
who has received the price of those goods.

I arrest. This Wifcovich always used to pay
I great court to foreign envoys, from whom
he drew large sums of money, by making v
them believe, that he could warp certain 1
members of the government. M. d'Aran-
jo deceived and abused by this fellow, it is
said, wrote home, that 'with a million more
Ihe could obtain from certain direftors, ad- v
I vantageous conditions for the treaty of
peace with Portugal. The affair of M.
Quirini is somewhat similar, except that the c
latter does not merit as much indulgence as a
,I M. d'Aranjo, to whose principles and mo- r
L rality we cannot but do justice. However, *
[ is an happy circumstance it is discovered,
â¢ | that M. Wifcovich, who was extremely in- '

of this kind only, but was also concerned in '
. the royalist conspiracies. He is strongly '

Frenchmen were on their way towards Swit

it was supposed wasceded to France by f;me
secret articles of the peace of Campo Formio.

" CITIZENS,
" The legiTâtive body haejuft solemnly
fanftioned the patriotic offering made to the
direftory by the merchants of Paris, by
publishing the law requesting the Englifil
lotn ; tW _exrÂ»nÂ»>Ve jtre&ory will now re
* call to your mind the woiives that must give
you all an interest in the fucctfs in this mea
Â» sure
" Citizens, conquerors of Europe, you
have none but one enemy,'who lords it Â©-
ver the seas, and intendsto exclude yÂ»u frÂ®m
n them '
" The agriculture, the commerce, and
â¢ the induftryof France, every thing is bound
! down and fhaÂ«kled by the English fleet,
j whifch blocks up your ports.
" But it mÂ»re peculinÂ»ly belongs to you,
French merchants, manufacturers, and (hip
owners, to second with all your zeal the ex
1G ample that has been set to you by the com
mercial interest of Paris. Have you liken
ed to the minister of Great Britain, who in
'' farms you with the raoft insulting ostenta
tion, that the English commerce is to that
B " of France as 18 to 2 ; that the imports and
exports do not amount in France to more
than 400 millions, and that is England they
j" amountjto more than seven milliards French!
Have you a moment to lose in baffling those
calculations of English avidity ?
" France ha? been obliged to make a
temporary facrifice of her credit to the fne
cefs of the war. But now vidory ought to
repay its facrifices, and at the fame time se
cure to it tbafy portion of metallic wealth,
and that rank which the nature and extent
ro- of its territory, its [population, its coasts
ive and its rivers, ..challenge and mark out to-it
among the commercial powers. On this,
on> worthy merchants, you ought frrioufly to
Z, refleft. The national credit should be the
er- great foundation of your wealth. You (ee
iu- the aftivity of government in prohibrting
ax " all English merchandize, while it iÂ» equally
,ca ' anxious to open new outlets for the produce
of French industry. The cause we refer
th* you to, is your own. Whatever exertion
for you may make for the fuccels of the war,
liv . e vou will have made fur yourfebesâfor the
c . ri " prosperity of your manufa&ures ; for the
jn'i interest of your families ; and for that ot
ady your posterity. _
na- Citizens of every calling, reflect on trte
otlc important consequences which null result
oth ," from the effort which you are about toe*'.
C - n ert in order to humble and punish the pride
Item of the cabinet of London. For more than
one, a century, England has not cfeafed to 1-
Ol l> turb the tranquility of Europe ; her rett
a!"i less and unrelenting ambition has been ever.
rV vexing and turmoiling the continent, ro
J which flie imagined herfelf to be invinci f
separated. Frenchmen, it is your duty M
fur- teach that Island, that notwrfbftanduig
car-' insular fixation, it is by no means inaec *
, the fible, and that you may carry back into it
fter- bosom the calamities which it has broug
iedi- home to your fire-fides. England once di..
tlge- armed and vanquished. a perpetiw PÂ«-
che- from that instant established, and the bad
Hires ance of Europe fettled on a pevmanentba
nub- lis ; for the French republic, too *ro g
'lan. be attacked, will feel no mot.â¢ to
i the her greatness will set her above the fightsambition, and she will feci no desire of trans
gressing her own limits.
" Your success may, therefore, be ensur
ed. Vanquifb the English, and you seftow
peace on yourselves and on your posterity ;
you communicate its fcleflings to the whole
human rce. Your battles are the lad that
it (hall be neceflary to fight. With yon
Military glory {hall make it? stand, and even
future ages shall not produce any rivals of
- the heroes of France.
" But it is not enough to talk to you of
S'lory. The French revolution, disturbed
rom its fuch numberless obstacles
of every kind, will now be anxious to re
turn towards its sourceâit ought never to
be forgotten, that philosophy was its prin
ciple, liberty its objeft, and above all, that
its defthder* took up arras for the happiness
of nations. Frenchman, it is your ambi
tion to overthrow the dominion of the Eng
iilh cabinet ; but it is by no meani your
wish to epflave the English people- After
the unchecked success of the republican
arms, that people will owe you the obliga
tion of having rescued them from the weight
ef enormous taxes which oppress their towns
and villages. England shall no longer be
hold 18,000 fÂ»ldiers, J 8,000 foreigners, to
traverse th^ocean to threaten her iuhabitantg
with an immediate servitude. Her king,
by the combination of insulting tyranny,
(hall no loÂ»ger compel her to defray the ex
pences of these mercenaries who are paid to
enslave herâwho would believe it ? Eighty
millions of French livres have bÂ£en thrown
into the private coffers of George 111. to
indemnify him, as elector of Hanover, for
the expences attending the Hanoverians,
who he keeps is pay to maintain hi?defpo- j
tifm over his own British fubje&s.
" Hasten therefore, citizens. to vindicate
the freedom of that nation, whom you fepa- j
wte from the hatred which is due to her
â¢ppreflors. Let the French, ever loyal and
and ever invincible, approve themselves in
England both the opprefTors of the nu'niftry
and the saviours of its citizensârThe con
querors of the court aud the deliverers of
the people !
" Be allured too, that EnglilUmen, re
stored to freedom, will hasten to sue for a
glorious peace. The Englilh themselves
cempare the machiavelifm of their govern
ment with the good faith of F ranee, They
themselves have admired the moderation of
the French republic in the treaty with Au
flria. They know that in this contest which
their government compels you to renew,
â whatever may be the event, all the dccifive
, chances are agair.ft England. If France is
victorious in the firft attack, the govern
ment of Great-Britain will tumble to pieces
under the weight of an immense debt. -If
any rt'erfes retard your success, the Eng
lish mnft have seen that nothing can damp
your courage, and nothing weary your?per
feverancc. The more the efforts ofthe French
â¢re prolonged, the more the debt of indem
nification will augment, and Europe knows
that this debt will be discharged sooner or
later.
" What has been the consequence of
that fornndablefsague wIII ell the cabinet Â®f
St. James's had organized against you at
Pilnitz ? 6 7
'â¢ They compelled you to fight for your
independence; yon have conquered Bel
gium. They difpnted the pofleffion of Bel
gium. In defending Lombardy you restor
ed to France the boundary of the Rhine.
The war against you began in 1792, forty
leagues from Paris ; you pint an end to it
in 1797, thirty leagues from Vienna. Eve
ry obstacle opposed to peace has only given
the signal of new viiSlories. O, Frenchmen,
of all parties, the Englilh hav e done you
most evil. Their cabinet has excited your
internal discords. It was it which roused
Europe against you. It was the Cabinet of
St. Jajnes s that armed you against one ano
ther. Turn your arms against itâunite
march to London. There you will extir
pate the causes of all your calamities You
will find at London the advantages of ex
ternal peace and the end of your troubles.
Having no longer any enemies to conquer
5-ou will think only of founding the repub
lic upon repose and happiness.
" You have traversed a long career, and
attained your objeft. Already many con
curring presentiments announce vidWy
The power of enthusiasm has no limits in
France. In order to presage your success,
meaftire only your will. Your enemies have
but one hope, and that is, in influencing
your opinions, if they can, in discouraging
and disuniting you. It is in your own minds 1
that they wilh to eombat you on any other .
ground you need not fear them. Prove by J
the effect, that you have but one sentiment
that every one for himfelf is anxious to con
tribute to the great national work; that e- '
very one, according to his resources, inter
ests himfelf in the proposed loan. Let your
promptitude to accomphfh this objett be '
the omen and the image of the terrible ra- '
pidity with which the expedition must be '
conduded, and be aflured, that at the very 1
news of this unanimous movement, the ca-
binet of London, will already be vanquish- c

Insurance Company of North America.
For Insurance against Fias, Â° D .,P /"jfj
Houses, Ware-Houses, and other BniMmg*
on Goods crtnwned h' such BÂ«il<hÂ»gÂ») diftan. from
Philadelphia, ia the United States.
I. Commui lufurances, on hazards of the firft
class, will be undertaken at Â» premium of ahout
half per tent, per annum. For extra haear ous
rifqaes a larger prerr.iim will We required, w i .
will vaiy according to cireomftances, feidom ex
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; but in some m
(tances, where the property insured a not on y i
itfclf extra hazardous, but rendered still more
by the vicinity of extra hazardous bo. ding* anc
occupations, the premium demanded will be ratl.d
according to circumftacces.
Howies and Ware Houses, tKe walls and parti
tions of which are wholly of ftonc or jric. , vre
corftruAed, so aÂ«Â» bÂ» guarded as well *Â«may be
againlt fires from within, and tree trwffl extra_ ha
zardous building, and occupations in their neigh
borhood, will be deemed hazardous of the flrlt
cUss, and may be insured to their iV i value.
Also Goods' and Merchandize, not o< an extra
bazarJous kind, in cifks. bales, or packagss, de
pofitcd in foch buildings, to an amount not ex
ceeding 400 c dollars ; bat if more than this sum
is required to be insured in one tenemcat, an addi
tienal premium will be required, in proportion to
circumftaases. ,
11. Insurances will also be made on buildings and
goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to the risque. But it is not easy to arrange these
under particular heads or dalles, so as to describe
each withthe neoeflary accuracy. Each cafe mud
therefore be decided upon according to the circum
tlancesattending it; and these circumftanees will,
in general, appear from the defcriptioii accompa
uy.ng the application, t
Bu Idinjjs partly confVni&ed of brick or stone,
are preferable to thefc wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the stile of building, how they are oc
cupied, how they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how occupied, are cÂ«n6derations to
be taken into view. And with refpe3 to goods,
their'tendency, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are txpofed, either
to commence or to incrcafe an accidental fire, and
their liability in fucb state to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden aid hafly removal, or to be sto
len in time of confufion and hurry, are all cir
cumstance* of weight; and the premiums must be
proportioned accordingly.
-111. The followi%r conditions are to be under
flood by the parties .
lit. The Insurance is not binding till the fiipn
lated premium be paid ; but it (hall be deemed ef
fectual from the time of futh payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately
signed or not.
Â«d. Infurafices may be renewed at the expira
tion of the terra of the policy, without further ex
penfe< than the payment of the premium of the re
newed terra, the circumftancescontinuing the fame
as they were understood by the Insurers at the time
the former insurance was mad* ; but the payment
of the premium it efTential to such renewal; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; nor can the insurance be renew
ed on the former polity but by computing the
commencement of the renewal from the expiration
of the former mfurance. The fubjeA of insur
ance may nevertheless be open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. Tf any other infuraace be made on the fame
property ; it mud be made known at the Unit of
application, otherwise the policy made on such ap
plication will be void.

AT a juncture when the question of
a Ctmmereitl Treaty weitt France may soon
become aÂ« object of discussion, a workof this kind
becomes extremely ufefuf to those eitirens of the
United States, who may be defiroÃS to enable them
selves to view this fubjeft, under its various af
peiSs; and they will have the faiisfa&ion to be
furnifhed with the necessary dat 3, to judge of the
uiefulnefsef this tranfa&iou.
This work is principally diftiÃguifhed by the
richneft of the observations, the pcrfpieuity of the
iftas, and the modesty of the theory which it
contains. \t Pars, â  man of *-it observed, that
rhis work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to die very roof with ufeful produce. It is addref â 
fed to the nnfortuaate La FatÂ»tta, ia letters,
which fugitive fem, the author who could only
devote a few weeks to thje occupation . was
to adopt. Although eireumftancss are 111 many
refpedts different at the prrfcn: day, from what
shey were in the year 1790, when these letters
were written, yet it maybe justly said, that so ma
ny abfelute and permanent data still remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
sult of the author's remarks, it will serve to con
vince him that in all tranfadiotis, between free
nations, every thing may be expefled from the ef
forts of truth and juflice.

EfTayin the form of a tuilttu, to aporaife the im

iatii in ted. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better furnifbed fiom France or
Englandâlt is principally on this fubjeft (which
would havealtoaifheda mere thtonft) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kinJ of taMenux, uuluckily as difficult to obtain as
they are much to be defned, are the ooly sure guides
the fiatefmen can take for th policy of treaties, de
prived of wl.ich he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We c-innoltoo much admire the apparent ex
aftnefs of colonel Swan's calculations ; and although
the prophesies of Lord Sheffield have already been
com radiated by experience, and by feverai able pens,
yet it is curious to fee the author of ihe present work,
dispute with him the only groui.d or, which he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the required condition, will be better able
than Gteat Bntasn to supply us with fcveral articles,
which the Englilb authoi al.ots exclusively and foicv.
ertothe latter; the author's patiJity efeS en (if he
has anv) does not appear to have at any 11 me created
1 partiality cf ]*dg,mt. The refuit ot this calculation
is that in i;Bg, that is to lay, at a period when arts
and manufd&.itss did to: prefect in France the vast
means and piohaU'i.y of extension wlich tbey now
po&fs. that tÂ»en in 1789, it was prelumabie, that
France would not only have the means to supply one

with Gieat Bfiiain for the remainder, in proportion
