OBSERVATIONS
On Lavater" s Remonstrance to the
Executive Directory.
THE lamentable cries of Lavater to the
great nation,' have excited nothing in my
mind bjt ridicule and contemptânothing
of pit)'ânotbingof commiserationânothing
of friendfliip or good wishes. O Lavater,
you have greatly mistaken the phyfiogn-my
of the great nation, if you can believe that
either the pompous and absurd flattery, the
pitiful moan, or the ineffedtual threats of a
degraded Swiss vaffal âdegraded by his own
consent, by his owa agent yâcan move their
inexorable purpose of universal domination
and -rapine. Doll thou look for redress
from their justice * Follow with thine eyes,
as far an thine eyes can carry thee, the
baundlefs course of blood and devaliation
which they have passed over in a few years,
in a mite of time, and you may then indeed,
exclaim, with feelings of and not
in the vile'humiliation of a slave's flattery,
" What ether nation, ancient or modern, has
perfermed the actions which it has done ?"
But you must hope for nothing for poor
Zuiich from its justice. Do you hope for
a rettoration of your immolated liberty, and
plundered property, from the pity of the
great nation. Take the whole range of the
last eight yearsâtake all the vast and innu
merab'e scenes, both at home and abroad, 1
in which they have been engaged, and point
me a single instance where the cries of hu
manity have arretted the hand of blood, or
the tear of pity has glistened in the eye of
a Frenchman. Noâthey have thrown off
the authority of Heaven ; they have broken
down cxc*)- obligation of tfiiualfcy j tbsy
have extinguished every chaTafteriftic of
humanity, every tender attachment between
Man and man; âthey conquer to plun
der and enslave ; and the conquered and
enjlavel cry for mercy in vain. Meet the
robber at the thre(hold, and resolutely de
fend the entrance of your dwelling. If you
fly before him, or if, deluded by his per
fidious offers of frivndfhip and benefits, you
open your arms to welcome him, you are
indeed loft. Is it not incredible that in the
year 1798 any man (hould make an appeal
to the juflicc and pity of France. Where
have you been Lavater ? Are you " ig
norant of its deeds," or have you loft the
faculty of horror ? Do their awful crimes
pass in long fncceffiou before you without
an impreffian ? If thou could'ft applaud,
while they sacked the world and opened
riven of innocent blood, learn at least to
think, to reason, to know them from the
fate of Switzerland. But the desolation of
a neighbouring canton, of a filler state, was
too remote to open thine eyes, to expose
the bloody assassin, the insatiate robber.
Look then to Zurich, to thine owo Zurich,
and how canst thou be deceived, or hope
for justice or mercy from But you
would sooth them with thy flattery. Believe
me they will laugh you to scorn. The
flattery of a conquered, voluntary slave, is
dull, vapid, vile and ridiculous. They are
the " great nation, ~the matchless nation."
Alas ! poor Zurich has found them match
less indeed in perfidy, cruelty aud villainy.
You fay, " many of the most able and en
lightened heads admire the atchievements of
this people, considered as philosophers, poli
ticians and heroes." As philosophers, they
have filled the world with vice, discord aid
unexampled misery ; as^politicians, they have
governed by falfehood, perfidy and force, 1
and have laid the certain foundation of ages
of discord, bloodshed and wretchedness for .
their country ;â¢ as heroes, they have murdered t
weakness aud innocence, the infant and the
aged, the mother and her babe. You assert
another sentiment, for which I almost de- I
fpife youâLavater fpe;.ks not then ; it 1
is the conquered slave of France,âthe I
wretched dupe of Republican intrigues. 1
âYou fay that France " maybejuftly call
ed the great nation, fjr it has produced the I
greatest, and I -wills ill hope the mtfl benefi- ;
cialrefults ever produced by man, in any pe- I
riod of time !" This sentiment can need no
comment, no contradiftionâa(k Italy--a(k t
Switzerlandâalk Zurich, what are the be- <
neficial results of the atchievements of this t
great'nationâShew me the country oa earth, <
(hew me the man on earth, to whom their I
revolution, their conquests, their principles
or their friendfhip have yet been or are like
ly to he beneficial âSlavery, ruin and defola- c
tion are the certain consequences of all and
each of themâWhile the relentless rapaci- \
ty of France excludes you from all hope of *
pity from her, you give us a faft that will t
make the world deaf to your cries; even i
(hould misery accumulate tenfold upon you f
âWhen the true heroes of your country, (
her noble and magr.aaimous defenders, (pa- ]
trioti of immortal glory receive this weak ]
tribute from a free American !) were strug
gling against the hosts of France and the
dastard degeneracy of corrupted Switzer
land, werÂ« contending in a deadly exertion <
against the arm of the murderer and the trea
son of their brethren ; what did Zurich ?
" supplied the batbjrians with cannon and am
munition r For this deed (he is blasted of
Heaven and detested by manâParricide !
talk not of atonement. The ghosts of your
flaugbtered brethren call aloud for vengeance
âthe groans of your enslaved country (hall
ever disturb you. Let Zurich be swept
from among nationsâlet her become deso
late as a wildernessâlet her habitations be
come lonely rocks, and her waters be turn
ed to blood, and let it be remembered that
(lie aided the destroyers of Berne, and (he
will find no commiseration from man. Let
every American read and seriously refleft
ou this impsrtant fadt. Let them learn
from it that France divides to destroy ; and
j that those who adhere to her are involved
in a common ruin wijh those that oppofeâ
no pramifes bind tier faith, 110 fervics hold
her friendfhip. To feive France, Zurich
murdered her brethren: Zurich struck a
dagger to her own heart-.-yet Zurich is en
fiaved, plundered and destroyed. France
promises that no French troops (hculd enter
Zurich, that not afou (hould be demanded
of her. " But the vÂ«ry reverse happened"
âthree millions of livres are exa&ed, and
troops are marched in withojut the least pre
vious application to exhaust the country.
Americans ! be not deceived, be not divi*
ved by the black perfidy of French promi
ses. Let us stand ii m!y together, man to
man, brother to brother. If we then fall
it will bewfth glory, and we (hall not, like
Zurich, be funk in infajjiv and humiliation,
we shall not like her Pe followed with the
curses and contempt of the human race.

" IVe insert them Jor the amtffement of our

LIBERTY or DEATH !
Northern Army of Avengers.
" Head quarters, the First Year of

" United Irishmen,
" The soldiers of the Great Nation have
landed on your coast, well fopplied with
arms and ammunition of all with ar
-1 tillery worked by men, who have spread ter
ror amongst the ranks of the bed troops in
Europe, headed by French officers ; they
come to break your fetters and restore you
to the blessings of Liberty.
" James Napper Tandy is at their head.
He has sworn to lead them on to victory or
- to die. Brave Iriihmen, the friends of li
berty have left their native foil to assist you
in re-conquering your rights". "They will
brave all dangers and glory at the sublime
idea of cementing yosr happiuefs with their
blood.
French blood shall not flow in vain :
To armsâFree-men to arms : the trumpet
callsâlet not your friendsbe butchered unas
sisted ; if they are doomed to fall in this glo

" In the name of the French
Officers and Soldiers now on

General J. N. Tandy, to. his Countrymen.
" United Iriihmen,
" What do I hear ! the British Govern
ment have dared to speak of coÃceliions!
Would you accept of them ?
" Can you think of entering into a treaty
with a Britilh Minister? A Minister too,
who has left you to the mercy of English
soldiery, who has laid your cities waste, and
massacred inhumanly your best citizens ....
A Miniller,the bane of society, & the scourge
of. mankind .. . behold, Iriihmen .. â¢. he
holds in his hand the oliveof peaee ; be aware
his other hand lies concealed armed with a
poinard. No, no ... . you shall
not be the dupes of his base intrigues. Una
ble to fubdne your courage he attempts to
subdue you, left his efforts be vain.
" Horrid crimes have been perpetrated in
your country . . Your friends have fallen a
facrifice to their devotion for your cause.
Their shadows hover round you and call a
i, loud for vengeance*
" It is your duty to avenge their death.
It is your duty to strike on their blood-ce
mented thrones the murderers of your friends
â¢' Listen to no proposals, Irishmen : wage
a war of extermination against oppreflarsâ
the war of liberty shall triumph ?
Â«j. n.. Tandy."
Such is the authentic d'etail of a.circum
ftancc which was yesterday magnified into a
new invafian by 25,000 men, landed at Kil
lebegs, and established in full possession of
the county Donegal.
Black well, who accompanied Tandy io
his expedition, is a person who some time
ago was compelled to fly the county of Clare
for seditious pradtices.
When Napper and his friends found that
the good people of Rutland were not formed
of revolutionary fluff, and thought it prudent
to re-embark, they left with the post-master
of the town a certificate of which the fol-'
lowing is a copy
" Rutland Island, 30 th Frudidor.

" Dublin, Sept. 29.
m! J5r e -,n C Â°- ntof / hedefcatof th * Re
bels at Killala is confirmed.
" At an early period I told you that Mr.
Reynolds was to be rewarded for his infor
mation, and evidential service,, against th*
Executive of the Irish Union, wi,h the ap
point men t of Governor of the Bahama ft.
lands ; and I have now received further as
surance of this fad from very refpedable
au honty I l.ave also to inform you, that
Mr. K. has not only renounced, as you al.
ready know, his political errors ; he has
also adjulird those of religion, and last Sun
day le unight read hrs recantation of the doc
trines ofPopery, at the Asylum Chapel in
Leefon-ftreet.
Â«'â¢ When rogues fall out, honest men come
by their own. If this maxim appli s as
well among politicians as anions thieves,
some benefit may result to the public, fruni
a falling out that has taken place between
the proprietors of the Dublin Journal and
their late Diaator ! The cause was this, a
certain corps were prefenttd some days back
with a Hand colours by a lady, who accom
panied them with an address suited to the
occasion ! This was givtn to the Dublin
Journal for infertior, a d, (trange to tei),
1 cfufed a place in thofc columns which have,
under the present divots âf that print,'
ever been devoted to the purposes of politil
ca! irritation and division. But incredible
as it may seem. fnch was the fad xhe
Editor, who isSccreiary to a kind of Com
mittee of Orange Matters, or, if I ma y f 0
term it, to the Orange Directory 01 the
Irilh disunion, endeavours to excu'e himfclf
by faying that he has been obliged to ad in
this cafe conformably to orders received from
a cer-uia- high official quarter, and which
went to prohibit the insertion of any thing
of the Orange callâbut all in vain. The
great man is not to be appeased ; and his
high fpint can ill brook to have his " wav
prescribed in Venice." This, following the
defeat of the Wide-street job, looks well
for Ireland.
" Hie plunder and depredation exped
ed to arifeout of the present disordered state
of this illand, is every day more daringly
manifefted. Last night a banditti of a do
zen or twenty men brgke into Alderman
Truelock's country-house, within about a
mile of the city, and on the Rock road the
rnoft populous avenue, and robbed it of cafli
&c. to a considerable amount. The fecuri'
ty of perlons and property, I am sorry to
fay, promises to be very precarious through
out the ensuing winter. f
" I have nothing further to add, than
that Tone has not been executed this day,
but is expefled to be hanged tomorrow."
TONE's DEFENCE.
September 14,
This day Mr. Tone proceeded in his de
fence. He called as a witness his father,
Peter Tone : the questions which he wilhed
to alk him were written on a flip of paper,
and piefented to the Judge Advocate, who
examined the witness from it.
yau knoow the prisoner ? and have
you had any, and what intercoufe with him.
âA. 1 am his father ; I reared him, and
have had that intercourse with him which
generally subsists between father and fan.
How old is the prisoner ?âA. About
twenty seven years old.
Did the prisoner at any time leave
his country to go to any other, and at what
time. A. He left this country about lis
years iince, in to to America.
â¢ Why did he leave Ireland ?_A.
failure in his circumftancesmade him leave it.
Did you know the habits in which
the pi ifonei lived, previous to his going a
broad ? A. I did ; and knew him to lfave
been sober, anj attentive to his business, un
til business went wrong with him.
What was his business ?âA. He was
engaged in the cotton manufaaory.
Was a man that at all interested
himfelf in politics ?âA. Not to my know
ledge ; I knew him rather to attend to his
business.
you know him at any time to be
long to any political foriety ?âA. Never;
nor Jo I believe he ever knew any thing a
bout them. Had he belonged to any s uc h'
fcciety, from my intercouife with him, I
rauft have known it.
Mr. Tone called no other witness. He
proceeded to read his defence, which was
nearly as follows : '
Mr. Prefidcnt, and my lord* and gen
tlemen of the court martialâFully relying
upon the validity of the obje&ions to the
competency of this court to trv mt in the
present cafr, and expefling, from the hor.or
and humanity of the court, that they will
not only allow to these objedions their fall
weight, but that they will also take into their
aouuderation whatever favorable circtimftan
ces may be conneded with my Unfortunate
situation : I proceed not so much to urge a
defence, as to give you a plain and candid
account of the whol.- courfc of my condufl,
before I do so, however, I must cbferve to
the court, that when I objeded on Monday
aft to their competency, I did not mean to
ay that they were a court nnbiown to the
law ; I acknowledge that it is 2 conftitutiot -
al court, and recogmV.ed by the common
law of the land ; but I did mean to infill
that it is authorised to .dÂ«Â»ly in certain ca
' and at ccrtaln times, and that it is in
competent to ad, unit fs at those times, and
in those cases. I have already admitted that
lam an Irishman. Unfrcccfsful Tn my en
deavors to obtain an e!labli(Wnt in my t.a
ttve country, I was obliged, at an early time
of l.fe to quit Ireland, and go to America.
This ncceffity | rcfe f rom cUcatu Ãw*
v v. nich 1 was unable to for?fec or to remedy ;--
It arose (imply from my failure in bliSnefs,
and was totallv uncÂ»Â»ne&cd with any polit
ical co You have heard from
the witness against me, that, previous to my
going iu America, I was in France. It is
true that I did go to France ; bat at that
time the war between France and these
eoÃritritHi had not commenced ; and as you
Lave l.tard from the witnef?, 1 was arretted
in France as a spy, and confined for nine
months Had I been a polical agitator, j
did I entertain designs against my country, |
or was I accredited by any discontented par
ty, it is impossible to suppose that I ftiould
have b-en tUus treated, at a time when it is
well known France was but too eager to ex
cite and to receive persons of that descrip
tion. Fom France I at length escaped
and arrived in America ; from
I had resided tSere for some time. I was in
duced to vilit Hamburgh, where I had a
fitter. At Hamburgh I remained un
til I became weary of being a burden
to those whom I would rather have
wiflied to affilt. I quitted it; and will it be
imputed to me as a crime, that with pover
ty flaring me in the face, and a c mpetence
folic!ting my acceptance, I accepted that
compete ce, and did take a commiflion i/
the Frcech service ? I became a foidier ;
and, ir ohedie- ce to my orders, embarked
at l;i R 'Ciiciie with the army which landed
j- Ireland. But though I embarked with
that army, I most solemnly declare I was
not only not consulted, but not even appri
sed of its object. I was too obfeure to be
afktd for my advice, though my
of both languages induced them to fvcure
my co opeiation. When in Ireland, I ap
peal even to the witneis against me whether
I officioufly in the fervicc,'or wheiher
I d-d more than it was neceflfiry I (hnuld do
to avoid disgrace and death ? I appeal io
liini, whether I affiled in depredation, plan
ned an attack, or appeared in any way cor
dially and a&ively to promote the object of
the expedition ? Though I aflÂ» d fr ,m ne
otffity a3 an officer, it appears from the
evidence that I was decidedly adverfc to the .
Reb Is ; as soon as possible I made my ef
capc irom thern, affnmed the appearance of
a peasant, while I was in fcarch of a Ms
giltrate to whom I mi;;'nt surrender. When
tak;ii, Ici nfeffid my name and my litua
tion, and used no artifice to conceal the
truthâa circumflance which alor-e m,iv tend
to procure me relief, when I fay that I had
fled trom the Rebel-;, because I would not
join in their cause, and was seeking an op
portunity of giving my felf up to a Mag'f
trate. You have now the whole of nay un
fortunate (lory : born to no inheritance, re
duced in my circumstances, fend deltitute of
support, I left my country and entered into
the service of France. This is my only
crime, t am no fomentor of sedition ; I am
no conspirator against the state. As a foi
dier, I was ordered upon service, and I 1!
obeyed ; and in that service confined myfelf
flriftly to the inevitable duty of the station
which I filled. It this (hall not amount to
a legal defc ee, I hope it will at lead wipe
obloquy from my name, and foften the !
har(hntfs of piivatc judgment, if it (kali fail
to mitigate the severity of a legal fentenre." j
Mr. Tone, having given in this defence,
"begged it might be transmitted with the j
other proceedings of the trial. In prsfent- i
ing to the Judge Advocate, he said, hit.!
wilh was to prove to the court that he was i
no way conneAed, nor ever was, with the
Society of United Irilhmen ; and that he
fled from the Rebels to avoid engaging in
their wicked proceedings The court was
then cleared of strangers. *â

'
# * # The EaQern Mail arrived at a i
: very late hour, but brihgs ncthing new. <
THE man who doubts the organization of a 1
party in thia country, to overthrew its confti- r
tution and government, and to new model both -
with the affiftanee of France, mu!lbeacrea- e
twre of the doubtful gender, to fay the best of t
him:âbut he that fees the danger clearly, and
1 is not rea'ly to oppose it with all his force, pof
fefTes less animation of patriotism than is eonlil
trnt the charadterof a good citizen. If F
we refleil on the general fame of the French a
. Defp ts for auÂ£livity, am(>ition and perfidy ; if
we cail into review their eondvnil tewards the
government and people rff this country, as j
well as towards all others ; and especially, if
we recolledt their impudent threats of humbling
ns to their wili, by the means of ipternal trai
tors, we mrjl think it neceflary to watch this V
vile class with vigilance, and to oppose e jery, o
suspicious attem vt oftheirs with decjfion and vi- J
gor. lam far from thinking tV,at the dangers, 0
which tkr.u en this infant empire, are confined j
to the pref nt day, although they now appear .
more obvious : No! the fame reitlefs ambition
the fame want of good faith, that have always J
been the charaflei iftic features of the French J
, cabinet, will continue todiftii'b our rrp 'fe, and
to exacerbate parties among us, fq long as there
isa rivalry between her and Great Britain ; âor ft
until there is an infuperabie barrier oppol'ed to
her profligate schemes. _
But to cftmhat this hydra the ordi iary powers
_ of gnvi-Bomepr ice h.trdly fifScicnf. without
tcrme extraordinary aid from the loiirTTTr and n
! tuous part of the community. There are many
things tkat (.ugiit to be done,' for which there is
no law provided, or funds exiling, which are
necessary to secure the general fafety against so
dangerous a foe. Few men are so profligate as
to plot against their eo'untrv, without some mo- "
tive of puo he or private advantage j and there g
are very few indeed, who can promise themfelvts
any real profit or gratification from a convulCon
or revolution in the State. But if this number, t ,
however small, are men of talents, and become f,
the obedient engines of the enemy, they are
fufficient to delude, inflame, and mislead a host c
of unfufpedling ignorunt men. she firft, there- v
fore, ought to be closely watched ; their secret r
caballings deteaed and exposed ; and the last to d
be undeceived, and, if it is pollible, to be re- a
claimed.
This will be laying the axe to the root of the
tree. Against an uaired people the French will r
never attempt any thing. Their government is
a " Committee of Uuiverfal Infurre&ion" ; it a
is by treason they work ; and the man who will ri
not unite with his own government and its
friends, to oppose so dangerous an eueoay, is a
traitor, and ought to be immediately crulhed ;
for if there ever was any truth in the axiom,
that "he that is not for us, is against u,," it a
exists at this day. It is fafer to cut off a gan- ti
grened member, than to endauger th# life of f,
the body, by its continuance. t |
Unite or Die, was the motto of the revo
lution war. We remember its powerful effect B
at th at period, and it will certainly be good po- G
liey to bring it into operation at theprefent crisis, a
when we have ten thousand times more at flake, c:
We were then contending against a parent and lc
brethren, frora whom we had reafor, to expefl t i
moderate terms, if their superior ftrcngth had
prevailed against us. The abjedl subjugation of
the colonies was never contemplated, nor would ?
it have been tolerated, even in England. But c
we have now to war agair.ft a crue! and rapa- Â«
cious enemy, opposed to us by every principle w
that is inimical and repu'five ; barbarians that p
contemplate not only tire total annihilation of â
civil liberty, but the proftra ion of our sacred ~
altars, the renunciation of our religion and our
God Unite or die is therefore at prelent, more "
than It ever was before, a maxim and a dutv of l '
ind.iperifablf obligation. * ai
The fr.ends of government should not only fc
know their own lirength, which I Mi=ve is o
great; but they should also know their enemies t |
and their lirength. i hey lhould atft with regn- si
larity, ui t ion and decision ; determined to sup
port one another, and the common cause of f:
their country and government against all pofÃble
rilques. But this will never be done without
niore union, and a betttr organization. Look
f t ,, t .' lf r ' aCoh i n3 â¢ f uc A "h kojte doreri ; fake a
lelion from them. Every where, however wi Je
ly dispersed, their lirength is concentiated â¢
they acl with the usitv of inflinel, as well as
the indtftry of demons; and it is b* th-fe
meins, they have beÂ«n able to retard and criop'e
every measure of national defence ; altho'iigh- "
they are fc*er in number, and incompjral. lv o
weaker in power, that they are dill able to fee' I
j the hopes, as well as to po.nt the blows of our ir
; barbarous enrmy.
I Let, therefore, Associ ati on sbe formed in
every confi erable City and Town of the Unit- r
ed States (the eximple may be set in Philadel
phia, 10 justly ciÂ«flihpruifhrd for its patriotic ex
ertions) let committees be appointed; fundi ) ,s
raded; prefies employed ; let information he n
dineminated at cheap rites every where ; let the
ignorant be
ed ; the banditti watched, in their upriftng and
dof.vniyings ; and I will rffer my neck to the
guilh tine, if, in rwelve months, after the scheme
is brought into operation, they are not complete
ly en/lied.
I The money and notes, taken by requifi
uon from the Bank of Pennsylvania, amount- ! â
ed to th. enormous sum of 164,000 dollars ; !
-tie whole of which has been recovered, to f,
within 2,000. This waÂ» almost a Gallic b
hug 1 fie Por er, Cunningham, wbo was ;
i alio a Democrat, wag a man' ia whom, it
seems, the greatest confidence had been
p<ac,dâ f which he availed himfelf to effeft
his villainous purposes. Finding he had '
got the Fever (with which he was seized (
the day after the robbery) Davis went to '
him, and thinking it uiifnfe to have so great 1
a quantity ot money, in so myllerious a fitti- 5
attcii, proposed to take it all home with
him, which was done : Davis, having thus
gotten the whole into his poffeflion, be
,â  th ught hiin how he might dispose of it ;
| and began to make large deposits in the
j different Banks. Coming, one day, to the c
, B-ik of Peruifylvania, with a coi'liderable
| fu;u, and being known to some perfous in t
.

c the bank, as a man wkofe visible means wore |
0 infiyniftcjnt, strong fufpiJous naturally |
d arole, and an erquiry was immediately
k made at the other banks, where it appeared
it lie had made (iepofits to the amount of
1 17,000 dollars. 'Means were instantly taken
to examine him, and after mueh ado, he
confeffedârefufing, however, to acknow
. ledge a large quantity of gold, which was
in the end difeovered upon him, untouched.
He had purchased a carriage and pair of t
- horses which he delivered up. Cunningham
died four days after the robbery.
The horrid (Irides with which the Dcmo
, crats of America daily advance in depravicy,
through the influence on their minds of
thofc deteflable principles of France, which
a inculcate that all property is common, that
to hold wealth is ariftocratical, and that j:
there are no future rewards or.punifhmeifs, i
a must, if net suddenly and severely checked,
- too' up all the foundations of society
h âWe regret, therefore that the villain has I:
' escaped the hands of justice, It-is hoped
I that these terrible instances, added to hun- F
â¢_ dreds which have heretofore occu r ed,of the si
. danger of tru fling men of democratic princi
f pies, will operate in future as a caution to

Mr. Fenno,
ALTHOUGH I have heard much said
about the beginning of the Nineteenth Cen
tury, I never supposed a reasonable doubt
subsisted in the mind of any person when
that period would arrive, and I acknowledge Â«
myfelf much farprifed to hear a gentleman
of education, abilities and candor, advocate
an opinion different from mine. From th s
circa:n(lance I am UA to propose tliÂ£ fol
lowing questions and answer them agreeably
to my own ideas of the matter. I
How many years make a century ? Sup
pose onÂ« hundredâcan the second centurv '
commence before the firft i 3 complcated ?
we suppose notâThequeftion then is when
was the firft century or hundred years com
pleated ? But not having befn much ac- T
quainted with centuries, and finding a ma- r
thematical prop rtiop between them and
months, I fnollitute.) th- word month in Â»
the place of century, Â«'hen a similar position
at once occurred to my mind. Moses mv J.'
