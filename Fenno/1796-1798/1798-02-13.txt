AT a jun&ure when the question of
a Commercial Treaty with Fran:: nviy soon r|
btc uie an objeA of difcuflion, a work of this kind J[
becomes extremely ufe(ul to those eitizens of tks
United States, who may be defirons to enable them- y.
selves to view this fubjeft, under its various af
pedis ; and they will have the fatisfa&ion to be
furniflied with the neceflary data, to judge of the "j
ufelulnefsof this tranfa&ion. 1
This work is principally diftinguiflied by the Â» rl
richness of the obferva'ions, the ptrfpieuity of the tai
iJcas, and the modesty of the theory which it foi
1 contains. At Pars, a man of wit ebferved, that pu
: this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up in)
to the very roof with ufeiul produce. Itisaddref- w.
fed to the unfortunate La Favjtte, in letters, pr
which fugitive fo'm, the author who could only an
devote a few weeks to this occupation, was obliged
to adopt. AlthoUfh circumftancrs aia ill many VV
.refpefls different at the present day, from what t h
thiy were in the year 1790, when these letters
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so ma
ny abfelute and permanent data still remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
. lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of
r the alterations, which have been made, are the rc
' fult of the author's remarks, it will serve to con
vince him that in all tranfa&ions, between free r
nations, every thing maybe expeAed from the ef
forts of truth and jufl ice. a"

the propheftea of Lord Sheffield have alreaoy been

yet it is curious to fee the author of the prelenl work,
dispute with him. the only gioutd he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the required condition, will be better able
' than Great Britain to supply us with fevetal articles,
which the Englilh author allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's partiality affefl tm (if he
his any) does not appear to have at any time created
trv a partiality of \uigmnt. Ihe result of this calculation
â¢ is that in 1789, that is to fay, at a period when arts
10 " and manulafi lies did not present in France the vail
' means and probability of cxtenfion which they nr^w

CONGRESS. th;
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
DEBATE ON THI Â»EPO*T OP THE COMMITTII
or PRtVILkOBS. ''r
_ th:
F*RIDA Y âFEBRUARY 9. ge
{Continual from ytjlerdmy 4 Gazette.) do
The House having resolved itfelf into a Committee VYi '
of the Whole, on the Report of the Committee wl
of Privileges, Mr. Dent ia the Chair, 3S
Mr. Otis said he was one of those who vvi
sincerely wished that the question before the be
committe could have been decided without th
debate, and that the world might not have
been informed that in that house a difference th
of opinion could exist on such a fubjeft. He wi
believed that there was a standard of propri- rt
ety a moral sense of decency existing in the T
mind of every gentlemai, which if followed di
would condnfl them to ijuft decision. The fie
finger of featiment pointed out the road to nc
their own duty and their country's honor; jig
strait was the gate, and narrow was the way. er
They might avert their eyes from this faith- ta
ful monitor, but they could net be <leaf to fu
its voice, nor should they escape the chagrin hi
that would arise when cool refle&ion should it
convincethem thattheyhadbeefc iwftrumetital tt
in sealing the infamy of the national legifla- fa
ture by difobryirig itl diflatea. The pre
sent question he stated was not a question l?<
between the gentleman from Connefticut and h;
the member from Vermont, but between the le
House of Representatives and one of its fa
members who feenaed to be unmindful of the n
dignity and decency that ought to be at- fa
tached to that character. It was a queftioA o:
between the people of the United States, g
whose dignity had bÂ«en insulted iri the per- o
son of one of its representatives and the de- p
linquent who had committed the infnlt; be- e;
twees the whole UÂ«ioti and the state of Con- v
ne&icut, an intelligent part of that Union. C
It was a coatroverfy of principles, a war of n
outrage: upon decorum, a struggle between d
ferocious paflions and wholesome restraints. p
On such a qucftien all party spirit should f
cease, all private friendfhip and political at- r
tachment should be fufpet>ded,and they were h
called upon to unite in a joint effort to save f
themselves from common infamy. t
In considering this question, he would c
challenge any one to shew fe fharneful an aft J
of aflault and battery, committed r
provocation, at any former period, or in a- t
ny country. It would be in vain to look t
to any of the states of Europe, agitated aÂ«d 1
convulsed as they are, for such an offence. ;
No man conversant with the history of the f
Six Nations, or verftsd in the traditions of ]
the Cherokees or Creeks, or of aay lavage i
tribes, who, in the fir ft rudiments of focie- <
, ty find it necessary to affociatc and deliberate 1
on their common ioterefts, could poiut out i
an inftancc of outrage so monftrons, so a- 1
bominable. It was conduit contrary to ]
the principles of all association good and 1
bad. It was that would break up> '
â¢ a brothel and put an end to a den of robbers.
At the recital of it the countenance of Â«ve
ry Americaa reddened, at the thoughts of
it his heart grew sick. He did not mean,
however, to attempt an aggravation of the
offence; but it was aa event which had deep
ly affe&ed himâhe had thought of it by
day, and when upon his pillow, he had not
I forgot jt.
Whit was said in defence of the member .
' from Vermont? No attempt had been made
to juftify his eonduA ; yet some gtntlemen
. had brought forward circumstances of ex
e tenuation. What wete they? It was said
Â« some provocation was gives, and that some
allowance ought to be made on account of
'' the situation of the house at the time.
8> With refpeft to the provocation, he
would mot now enquire whether any prov
ocation could juftify the offence which had
s been committed ; but on examination into
Â° fadb, it would be found that the provocation
,f was on the part of the gentleman from Ver
mont, at his was an accusation founded in
d error, whilst that of the gentleman from
j Connefticut was founded is truth; as the
._ (lory of the woodea sword, aritjhg from the
). gentleman from Vermont having been cash
iered and disgraced from the army, was sot
denied ; whilst what had been said with ref
,o pest to the representatives from Connefli
j. cut a&ing contrary to the lenfe of their
constituents, was founded in faljhood. These
>' were charges made aloud, and which the
II gentlemen from Connefticut, if he did not
_ hear them, might have heard as well as not.
And shall it be said, that members of that
hutife who quit the comforts of home, the
pleasing fuciety of friends, and honorable
te employments, to serve their country ; shall
;d khey be told, that their motives are venal ;
it that they are a&uated l.y a vvifh to obtain
offices in which theymightJlarv: in splendor,
'j? and in which they would be abused with im â 
Id puntty ? Yet this was said by the gentleman
from Vermont ; so thaft the provocation
if came from him, and of seeking
here for_extenuation, nothing but aggra-
j le vation was found.
With refpedt to the situation of the
house at the time, gentleman who have re
course to this circumstance, must fan6tion
" one of two pÂ«/fitions, viz. the house
]t was not in session, or. that the members of
the house were to be protested whilst in cer
re tainjjufinefs, and not in others. With ref
n* pefl to the house not being in feflion, could
t it be said, that after it had been regularly
formed, it could be dissolved without a vote
for the purpose ? Should it be said that
g, whilst the speaker was in his chair, members
were fafe.{ but, if he stepped out of it,
0 . club-law should immediately commence ;
: e- that they were to be protested on this fid*,
tv and not on that fide the bar ; that this fide
â¢Â° was a favMuary, but that that was a btar
garden ; that in their feats they were fafe,
but if they walked out of them they were
liable to be cudgelled 4 Surely not ; these
miflaktt arofc from a misunderstanding of'
>a ' the rules under which they afttd. They
were intended to prevent offerees from be-
ing
t.Viat offence* should take place after the
speaker had left his chair, as whilll he was j
in it. It could hardly be supposed, that jâfl
wliilft the speaker was in his chair, and ev- rt f i
ery member in his feat, that any violence lie
should happen. It conld not be expefted | >e '
that even the member from Vermont \totild -
<ts and spit in a mtmlcr'j face, or Inock him jr
down, whilst ht was fitting in his place. It ]
was when members were outlideof the bar,
when theyw?re not mxlerfo much re!lr*int S.
as at otlser-iTues, that the rules of the house to
' were mod-liable to be infringed ; and mem-
ben were surely protested as much as if .
, . f tio:
they were in their leats. g tt
The gentleman from Virginia bad stated p s ,
that a great part of the members were go
without t'ne bar of the house ; b.it was no gei
rtfpeft due to !who were within it ? ' !a '
They were certainly not inHruments to the mt
disorder. Would the people have any coti ,' ni
fidencr in their repreferita'ires if they had f e f
nothing to do but go out of th% bar to its
fight ? This vvas a diftitiftion which he nev- wa
er expefled to have been set up, and it cer- th
â  taiftly arose from a prejudiced -view of the
i fubjrft. He believed the American/people
had already anticipated their decision, and rc f
1, it could only be in one that the house and cu
1 the country could be saved from indelible in- W
â  fumy. cit
The fame gentleman fsid that all the mem
i tyers might have left the house. If this re J
1 had been the ease, or if a'grealer part had )ja
; left it, he fuppoftd the speaker would have f|
s said there was not a quorum, and the bufi- e d
: ness could Bot have proceeded. Mr. Otis si]
- said he did not mean to go into the fubjeft b
1 of privileges, though he did not, like the ,
, gentleman from Virginia, hate that or any Â°'^
- other fubjeft, the discussion of which was
- properly before them. He thought, how- th
- ejftr, that the conduft of tKe member from fu
- Vermoit in faying that if the members from th
. Connedlicut were to vote ngainfl a certain c
f nsotion, which was then the order of the m
ii day, they would be turned out of their
i. places, was a direst attempt to control the f 0
d freedom of debate ; the gentleman came !Â«a
> recking from Connefticut, where he said he jio
e had ascertained the sentiments of the peo- j ,O
e pie, and undertook to intimidate and abuse
the members from that state. Wat it not j r
d clear that such conduft had a tendency to ;
3 provoke recrimination ? And if it were ad- |
it rnitted, it must be evident they had nothing t j
l- to expeft but disorder, lloÂ«dfbed and mur- f c
k der / If gentlemen decided reafbnably, they w
d must decide that there never could be a J,,
e. greater outrage than this committed with tl
ic so little provocation. The resolution re- a
sf ported by the committee of privileges was f r
re a proper one, and to agree to it, was the 0]
e- only way in which they eould purge the tl
te house of its pollution. If this was not done, d
jt it could not be expefted that this would be
j- the lafl affray which would take place in the e l
;o presence of that aflembly ; if not done, w
id the people would lose their confidence in <Â«
ipl their representatives ; and if not done, he, g
s. for one, fhoold feci the honor of a feat in ft
e- that house, as greatly diminished and over- b
of (hadowedâaÂ» falling, as declining. Indeed l e
b, the only fatisfaftcry mode would be, to fend M
ie the member from Vermont back toliis con- ;t]
p- ftituents ; which would shew te the world, tl
>y that a conduft like this could never receive c
ot the fanftion of the American people. If c
this mode weie not adopted, it would be tl
er .better for the house to expunge its rules, ' a
ie and trust to their own forbearance for'the p
rn observance of order; or they had better b
x- adjourn, and leave the public business un- ;f,
id done. It is better to have no rules at all, h
ne than fuffer them to be thus grossly violated h
of with impunity. b
Mr. RtfTLfDOf said, he was hoc difpoficd to h
he ac ept the invitation which had been given yes- ! v
v- tcrday to pats over in silence a fubjeift which uaft
a( ] an indelible (lain upon the legislature of the â¢
to United States âHe was furprif*d at this inviti
tion being given, and greatly so at its coming
on from th eqwarterit did. He did rot suppose | a
tr ~ that twemy years has so tooled the hlood of the b
in hero of Mud Fort (Gen. Smith) âhe did not fl
>m imagine that short space of time would have c
be brought so much philosophy to bis mind as to fj
permit him to give a silent vote refpe<s\ing an
offence which wounded the chara<i>er of his
country, and preflrated her dignity and honor. J 1
Mr. R. said, he must own, that he had not the '
f '- philosophy of that gentlemen, but (hould ex- tl
it- prels, ii) flrong terms, the abhorrence which he c
eir felt for this giof# indecency. He hoped they (
c f e OouW expel the r*ember who had thus offend
ed j he was perfuadtd, sri m whit he saw m the
liÂ»ufe, that he would not be expelled uuanimeuf- r
JO ly, but he trusted the vote would be carried by '
ot " more than two thirds of the members present. f
iat If he Ihould he disappointed in his expectation,
:he and the hottfe,wa& not to be cleansed of its pollu> ;
ble tioa, fume eonfolationtohimto/eileift
a J] upon his not having given a silent vote âit would
. afford him some comfcrt when he thould return
to his constituents, who, he was persuaded, in s
al " commoÃ with their fellow citizens, from Geor- '
cr > gia to Nrw-Hampih re, would be scandalized t
im- l>y the Â«Â«irageous iadecency of the Vermont {

Jon on the p efest â¢ccafion âthat unused as he was (
j n â to public speakingânever having aR oceafion to

'^ e decency which would (if not pupifhed with set

0 f Virginia had spoken to-day. b:eaufe he flood in
order te lpeak. Yeflerdey he did not with the '
â  e *" yote to be taken until he had delivered his fen- '
T "~ tisncpti. He wished that gentleman had felt as I
u 'd much for the dignity of the country, as he did i
irly for tlx gentleman from Vermont; if so, t e |
ote committee would hot havt had to liflen to his (
bat up-biUfpeecbt Ti c genllcman wo rd
for uling / this term, as his observations
' â¢ were inaccurate, and he had recurred to things 1
1 ' aa fa<SÂ» which were notfo. <
cc Â» The gentleman had undertaken to fay the
house was rot in fefT:on, % without attempting to j
fide prove it. In confirmation of this opinion he
rar - said, that a feoltor fat in his (Mr. N't) feat, ,
a f e during the coufcting of the ballots, and wrote a
' letter." This, Mr- K asserted was untrue. â
j- Whim the senator was standing without the
1r bar, he was requested by a member from Perm
Â°* fvlvania tq frank a letter.. He was invited to
hey ,uke < feat for the purpose. He declined, fay
be- ing, " vcur uosf; Â»Â» ia feffioa " On being as-
r fured there would be no impropriety in the tbi
thing, he went to a dtfk and wrote the addrels p t
of a letter as requeued, and theit retired.
! Mr.FiNpI.KY said, that the faA was as hid â 
1 jnft been stated, except that when the gentleman ;
- rif the senate was delired to write the frank,
: he did not objeA to it from an idea of the house o
I being in feCion. For his own part, Mr 1' â¢ laid,
j .he did not foconfidar it, or he fliould not have frc
thought e>f afkiug him to take a feat within the ne
' bar of tbe house. jTI
c Mr. Nicholas could not fay he saw the

Mr. HuTlitt'OK fa d. it was not nnnfual for j th
r the gcntlrinHn from Virginia to deny the iut"*;i- ; ati
tion of milreprefeotatiori. With refpeift so the (b
firuation of the house at the time rhis- affray hap- W(
pened, Mr. K. acknowledged thnt it was not in
e go'd order, thou hit was ill fefboii. Uut the
d gentleman from Virg nia said, no.motion c.rjld , w

motion could be made whilfl he was Ipeikirrg,
nor whtlff the house was engaged in any other jb
' business. There was noway of getting oit of no
" Telfion, but by adjouniment ; so that instead of
0 a flSion to l-iv the houlewasin
was certainly a fitffion so I-'iy it was not fi>. He j
. thought with his friend from Madachufetts, it"
e that this was riot to be considered as an offence j
against the gentleman from but as m ,
j an offence against the nation ; and unl;fs the ];].
resolution Ihould be adopted, the charter of,
cur country would be a degraded o e indeed â : -
i- What will on this occasion be the feelings of our i

' e They must acknowledge the fail ; but ha hop- i
i- ed they would also have it in their power to j '

a ly exfielM." i p
ie The gentleman from Virginia concluded his ,tv
obferv.-.tiens with a with, that every thing of a th
' ' party nature might be kept out of visor. Mr. jj,
R.faid this, might desirable! but he alio m
thought it was neeefiary to look at the business
Â« fully. He 'wished gentlemen to fee the thing in j c
m this light s for if members were permitted to j
[ n commit offences with impunity, it would put a ui
)e minority completely iu the power of a majority, at
and buoy lip the latter te a height which would bi
II be very inconvenient to a minority. He, there
,e j fore, thought that though a difference of pnliti-
ie ! sal opinion ha-1 drawn a Ilrong line of diftinift
le j ion betwesn them, to restore the house
0 . 'to its former purity, they ought to unite thsir "
f e | force in expelling the member from Vermont fc
j from his feat. ft
s I Mr. R. having fat down, the Â«a|l for the quef
to | tion was very loud. t(
I Mr. Sitgreavss said, before the quef- j
'S tion was taken, he wished to make some ob- .
""" fervations upon it. He was one of those
c y who had felt from the firft moment in which a
a Ve was informed of this occurrence, until
â¢ the grefent time, as a member of that body f
" e " a very firong sense ef humiliation, arising
a ' from the fatt itfelf, committed in the face
he of the house, and from the manner in which
he the enquiry into the bulinef) had been cob-
c > d lifted/ j-|
be On the'evening <rf the day on which the {
he offence had been committed, he had said {
ieÂ» what he never fhottld repent having said,
,n " that he was at that moment prepared to
!e, give the vote which is now called for. He
it ttill believed, that to have expelled the mem-
ft"- berfrom Vermont before the house separat
ed i f d, would have been the propereft step
nd which could have been takem for preserving
,n - the honor of the house, and for expiating
Id, the offence. The major opinion was, how
ivc ever, different. Though the offence was |
If i committed before their eyes, it was agreed
he that a committee should be appointed to ex-
es, amine the evidence. They did so, and re- j
ht ported the result. Yet, after this, it had c
'Â« r been determined to re-hear the evidence be- J
; fore a committee of the whole ; so that they
'IU had been obliged t* expend the time of the
ed house and the public money, in rt-hearing a '
bulinefs whiqfi had already been fufficiently
to heard, and they are now called to give a
ef- vote upon the resolution originally reported.
The gentlemen who have spoken against
the resolution, have made no apology for the J
â  U r faft itfelf. They have acknowledged the
0 Â£ aft was indecent, outrageous and improper;
the but they have availed themfelvcs of circum- 1
not stances to get rid of the consequences of this N
Â»ve confeffton. Though he owned this admif
-Ito fion gave strength to the resolution, yet he |
was sorry it had been admitted, if gentlc
men still opposed the propriety of the refo- *
t ]ic lation; as he hoped when the faft was ad- j
ex- mitted, the committee would not have been
he compelled to listen to any thing in extenua- |
hey tion of an aft so grofi and indecent.
Mr. S. said he would confidyr the argu- J
ments which had been adduced to get rid of 1
b v the consequences which followed an admif- *
mt. fion of the faft.
on, He confefftd he had heard it intinuated,
" u * in tlie course of the examination of the wit
neffts, that the house was not in order when
this offence was committed ; yet he hardly
â¢ n expefted it would have been seriously main
ror- tained. It had been conllantly aiked whe
zed ther the house was not in feiHon, from the
ont Speaker's taking the chair till the vote of ad- '
journment ; fe was impossible to disorganize
* as the House without a vote of adjournment ; 1
l and all the pretexts which have been Hfed to
â ble S et t ' l ' l P 0^110 "* are l 'fe the argu- .
in- ment of the gentleman from Virginia, Jic- (
fe- tiont contrary to faft. It was said the house j
and W as not engaged in any bulinefs. Was this
true? Were not two members of the house '
appoiuted as tellers to count the ballots for '
t | le managers, and were they not counting the 1
rcn . votes ? Wss not the house engaged in bu- '
tas finefs when a member was speaking? purely
did it wis. And was it not also engagrd in bu
t Â« finefs when the clerk was reading papers? It !
, I 1 '* certainly was; and, at the time when this
affray happened, the house was as much en
in 'â > ' n 'he ordinary business of the fitting,
as at (his or any other moment. It was
tlje said the house was not in order because ths J
gto speaker was not in thÂ« chair. The Speaker
I is not in the chair now; nor was he when
f "' lengthy communications were received. But j
it was also said that many members wer# out
the of their feats. But some were in their [Jac- !
;rm- es and could not the house be in fellion, ex- I
1 to cept. all the members were in their places ? j
fay- At this moment, he said, I fee groupes j
I round the fires, and would it be said that j
the lioufe wire not now in order â¢ /t waÂ« inj.
1 poflible to shew, (hat thtfc indulgence!
which members availed themfelvts of, de.
composed the house. It was not in the na
' tare of things that the bouse could be dif
' solved is flic h a way.
, But it was also itated, that the member
: from Vermont and the member from Con
: ne&icut Were on the outside of the bar.â
This was an endeavour to substitute a fort
= of fiction to get rid of the rules of the house.
, But could it bs supposed, that a ir.embet
' without the bar was less fnbjeft to the tnles,
r than whan ia his feat ? Gentlemen had cre
ated thi 3 diftin&ion ; but no one had said
s that an offence committed without the bar
would not be puuifhable ; and if it wereli
' able to punifhmcot at all, he saw no reason
j why it (hould not be liable to the highest
j punishment.
. Mr. S. was inclined to believe, thattho'
r these nice diftindlions were urged, they were
\ not mnch relied upon ; because though gen
tleme.i used them, they had recourse to o
e I thers; a'id if these had been well founded,
i they woulJ have been fufiScieot.
* | It 1 was said} that the member from Ver
-8 mont could not have put up with an insult
e . like that offered by the member from Con
s ne&icut, and that the impoflibility of pntt
~ ! ing up with it was a fufficient extenuation of
e ; his crime. He had all along thought that
r whenever any thing was said of the provo.
d ; cation which produced the aft complained
r i of, they wandered from the proper path.
â¢ j He believed no anterior ciiVmtiftance had a
' ! ny thing to do with the judgment which:, the
.. | House ought to pass upon this offence.â
; Provocation might make forme difference be
lt j.twixt the parties themselves, but it had no
a thing to do with the bufistfs as it n>fpe&ed
r that house. If provocation was to be ad
? mitted, in extenuation of a crime, no of
n fence could be committed that waivM not
0 | find an apology. If a man's pafiions, and
1 | ungovernable iiature, were to be an extcnu
atiori, crimes of the blacked nature wouid
( ! be thus apologized for. But it was agreed
â ' in every society, from the convivial meeting
t '" to the Legiflatnre, that some rules were
)e neceSary for their government, and when
j r these rules were once fixed, it was necessary
at for the preservation of order, that they
should be observed. If the gentleman from
Vermont conceived hirmfelf injured,he ought
- to have taken another time for resenting It.
If a number oÂ£ gentlemen meet together,
j!" and an insult be given which is patt be-
I rng tolerated, and which calls lor fatisfaftio*
.j and atonement, will any one fay that the
I proper way of obtaining these, would be to
interrupt the harmony of the company in
which the individuals are assembled? Do
not those who call themselves gentlemen,
suppress their indignation, and seek other
means of obtaining fatisfaftion, means which
shall not afFeft the peace and order of foei'e
ty? Is it net one of the efTential rnles of
j the laws of our country, that no man shall
be permitted, by giving way to his own
private passions, to disturb the or<jer of so
ciety? And the fame rule ought certainly
to be observed in that house more efpeeially.
But will gentlemen fay it was impofiible
"P fee the gentleman from Vermont to post
pone an atonement for the offence which he
'k supposed was committed against hi*i? will
" gentlemen ferioufiy fay this, when the mem*
, ber from Conneftieut, who received a much
greater insult, was able to preserve the ref
peft due from an individual to the whole
Repvefentativds of the people of the United"
States; could, any man suppose that the
' feelings of the gentleman from Connecticut
were less sensible than the feelings of the
gentleman from Vermont? would any pne
call in question his spirit or ability? Do
not all who khow him, know that his cos
j rage, strength and spirit, enabled him to
take instantaneous revenge, had not bis res-
peft for the house prevented him from doing
he so L
But, if they were to' enquire into this
' provocation, the result would be as unfa
voorable.astheprineiple itCelf. Ifan enquiry
jj- were inflitutedat ail, it must be carried to
its fouree; and it would be found the mem
j ber from Vermoat was the aggrefior. It
would be found that he was in the habit of
j provoking insult. It was in proof that,h*
en had called in qneftion the integrity of ihe
(a members from Connefticut. The whble
fubjeft of his conversation with the Speaker,
was one uninterrupted series of refleftions,
the most scandalous and nntrue, upon the
whole delegation from Comreftieut; and the
person who was guilty of the firft provoea-
tion was guilty of the whole. When gen,
j ' tlemen admit that the provocation which
eH the gentleman from Vermont received, as
it some extenuation o'f his fault, they must al
|Q so admit the fame for the provocation reeei
ved by the gentleman from Conse&icut; so
that when gentlemen find the firft and lad
offence committed by the meifibcr from
Vermont, an inference it drawn which is ir
t refiftable.
For SÂ»imfelf, he thought the indecorum
r which the gentleman frsim Vermont had
been gailty of towards the representatives of
Connefticut, would, of itfrlf, have juftiiied
s his expulsion from the houft. He confid.
ered the fpittiiig in the member's face as a
f 0 personal oflence; butthc others were wounds
l ie upon the better part, the moral spirit of
ju _ those gentlemen; so that the firft offence
J was the most aggravated of the two.
H| It was impossible, f.ir, S. said, to state
j t a cafe more clear than that the resolution
j 3 before the committee ought to be adopted
en Â® ut was thi.'i all ?It was not. It was neceflif
lrT ry to call the attention of the comm'ttec, tÂ®
the Itatement made by the chairman, of the
ths K r Â°ff'y indecent words mad* use of by the
_ tr 1 member from Vermont, in the close of hi*
]fn defence ycfterday. When the member \vaÂ«
sut ' la y in K u "^ er the reproach of the house, for
nt violating the rules of decorum, for violating
ac . i the refpeÂ£l which he'owed to the houfeâ
ex- ' w^en on s trial for this very faft, he in
,g j J traduced au indecency of nxpreffion which.
p tJ | cannot be overlooked, as if he bid defiance
hat Ito the house, and wen; determined to addoffence to offence. This alone, as well ax
his former aft, was fiifficient to havciuitifi- <if.
Ed an immediate expulsion. He â  believed a fta
body properly tenacious of its own honours me
would have come to a vote of this kind ;hnt the
the longer the enquiry was prolonged, the ela
more they invited his outrages. He wiihed,
therefore, to add this latter offence to the cla
former, in order to fh<-w the full ground of pel
the member's expulsion, since this latter tai
offence was of too gross a nature to be 101 l hir
fight of. He moved to add the following wa
woWs to the resolution," and for a gross
indecency of language in h<: defence before this mi
.house." ' c Â°
This offence, Mr. S. said, did not pass fid
outside the bar, or whilst votes were coun- to
ting, nor was it provoked. If there were
gentlemen in the house, therefore, who wi(h- be
ed this man still to remain amongst them, pi
let them take the responsibility upon them- be
ftlves. k
There was one circumstance more which
had not been noticed, which was the impro
priety of depriving the member of his feat el
and his diftrift of a Representative. It would n<
be more honourable to the diftritt, as men
and as citizens, to believe they would re- r Â«
joice in (hewing theirfenfe of the mifcondud
"of their ratrbtr, by returning another. In
sfting thus, they Ihould be giving thediftrift tl
an opportunity of wiping away the stain b
which in some degree attached to them for tl
an 1 offence dose by .their representative. Â«
When he was sent back to his conftitnents, f'
they would difpofeofhim a3 they thought
proper ; if they approve his condudV, they 1
will fend him again; if not, they williend w
member in his place, less likely to
contaminate the body to which he is sent. u
Some objections were offerer} to this y
amendment by Messrs. R. Williams and (<
Mi- Gallatin. They said, if the expref- r
Cons complained of were considered as a F
contempt of court, they ought to have been 1
punilhed immediately as fucb ; but if they
were bro't forward as part of the char ge "
against the member from Vermont, he ought 0
be heard in bis behalf, as on the former
charge.
Aflei the amendment had been support- 1
ed by Messrs. Sewall, Brooks and Harper,
Mr.'Coit trusted, when he declared it to v
he his intention to vote against this amend
ment, he (hould not be thought to be an ad-
Tocate of Mr. Lyon, or Â«f his iniecent
language. 111 the course of his defence,
he hid made use of seVeral expressions high
ly improper to be uftd by a member of that
house ; but they marked the charafter of
the man. He wa6 unwilling, however, to
hnld of these circumstances against
him, but would give them all the weight
they deserved. He presumed the particu
lar exprefiion alluded to fell from the mem
ber inadvertently, and was not intended to
offend the decorum and order of the house.
He. therefore, thought, notwithstanding
the opinion which he had of the man, that
it wonld be more confident with th â¢ e ndor
Â»iÂ»d dignity of the house, not to notice it.
Mr. Dayton (the fpjpker) said, that in
his opinion, the gentleman just fat down,
had said more in defence of themember from
Vermont, than he had himfelf uttered, or
than had been said for him by the gentle
men from N. Carolina and Virginia. He,
had given fan&ion to the plea of the mem
ber from Vcrmortâwho said that he did not
know he was violating the rules of the house
âhe did it thrtugh inadvertence ! Was this
a plea to be made for this man ? Before,
said he, we knew what we had to expeft,
and that it was necessary to walk with dirks
or daggers for our defence against him ; now
we know, that when he rises to speak, the
ears of all must be flopped, or offended,
with his gross indeeencies. He hoped,
therefore, that the gentleman froth, Connec
ticut would allow this charge to be added
to the resolution. Ne.ither the gentleman
from N. Carolina nor the gentleman from
Virginia attempted to defend his conduft.
Already it may have been noticed (be at
least had noticed it) that the chairs in the
line in which the member from Vermont fits,
have, in a great meafnre, been deserted.
He hoped, therefore, the committee would
agree in bringing forward this last indecen
cy, and join it to the other charge, as it
was fiich as would not be allowed in any
grog-shop in the country.
Mr, Coit said he (hould withdraw his op
. yofition to the proposed amendment, so foen
as he was convinced he was wrong ; sooner
hÂ« must not be expefted to do it. There
was a great difference betwixt words and
a&ions. Every man's experience must tell
him that words sometimes drop inadvertent
ly. This might have been the cafe with the
member from Vermont, and he still thought
it would be better to pass over thi3 ex
prcffibn.
Mr. Kittera said the expression could not
be uttered inadvertently, as the member read
hit defence.
Mr. S. Smith dt'4 not believe that the tx
jpreflfion alluded to was read. What the
gentleman read, was delivered in a tone of
voice whieh every one could hear ; but
what he said as he fat down, was uttered io
a lower tone of voice, and he did not hear
it. He had read his speech that morning
in the papers, in which there was no such
expression âHe wiihed to repeat to the gen
tleman fromS. Carolina (Mr. Rutledge)
â who had given him a PhiUippu, that his rea
son for wishing to take a vote upon this
question without debate, was no other than
to spare a farther cxpenc# of time up
on a business, which he thought, had alrna
dy oecupied too much.
After a few other observations, the ques
tion was put on the amendment and carried
48 to 43.
(Debate to be continued.)

king out tlft words "be for this disorderly th
behaviour expelled," and insert in theii A
place, "is highlycenfurable, and that he th

The question was then taken upon the in

The house took up the report, and the tl
question being put upon the amendment, it p
was agreed to 49 to 46. si
The question was then about to be puÂ» a

l( Your fliends, Patrick M'-Mafter and
Mr. William Harrij, have lately perilhed by

ANOTHER FIRE !
About 4 o'clock yesterday morning the
inhabitaats of this town were alarmed by the
nÂ» cry of fire. It was from Mr. Gray's Chip
rc the Aurora, lying in the harbour, partly
loaded for a foreign voyage. When firft
d discovered, Ihe was so completely involved
in flames, that neither the owner, or scarce
: h any other person, conceived there was any
chance for saving her. However, some
m boat-loads of men, of extraordinary powers
y. of exertion, went off direftly with the fuc
iv tion engine, which is under the direftioa
a, of Mr. Sweetfer, got under the stern of the
:h vessel, and poured a deluge into the cabin
(where the fire began) and soon darkened
ig its fory. They were immediately seconded
Jn by other* of their fellow-citizens; and their
âºd united efforts fiaally restored to Mr. Gray a
de ship and cargo worth ten thousand pound*
which he had conldered as inevitable loft,
ce with a comparatively trifling damage. A
its large quantity of rum was in the hold, but
nd so well secured that happily \he fire Jid
;rs not touch it; but two puncheons which
nd were left between decks caught, and assisted
in spreading the Qacies ovar the ship.
An u/ibappy man, by the name of,.Dun
c:\n, had the care of the vcfTel that night, and
hi# canille no doubt occasioned the fire. He
Inmftlf was burnt to death in the cabin.
A number of the fame getitLnperi, whose
exertions were so couf i wous, and ft> cffeGn
al in the late fire at the school-house, were
foicmoft in faring this vi-ITel ; and they and
their companions defcrve the thanks of the r

T he firft coup d'rjfai of the new order of

have believed with Burke, that the Age of Chi

which exffttd the prime bulwark of Chivalry,
till certain modern quacks drove it out of vogue,
by il Turpi up it as a cover for rascality, bound
every Knight by the (once) forcible ties of firm

of the order, and the person ofTlis aflociate, at

its primitive ilate, when tyrant order had not

From the old world, indeed, it may have taken

it still lingers here, and that here it (till has va

t- The Habitual Bottle.
'' MR. FEN NO,
y I called a few days pad, after an absence
of fix years, to visit an old acquaintance, whose
talents are at once an ornawent and an honor
to the community; the pride, the l>oa!l,
and the support of his friendsâand I pro
ie I phecy may long continue so, if the habitual
,p battle is banilhed from the number of the
] y Utter, and ranked a3 it'ought to be, amoag
â¢ft his mÂ«ft deadly enemies. Infteadof the man
â d ly step, the upright deportment, and tha
cc jrm hand of friendfhip, I mark'd at altcr
,y ed gait, a faultering voice, and received a
le trembFtng hand.
rs I was struck with horror at the change,
q. yet in these things it was not less visible, or
)B less mortifying, than in the change of fub
i,, ' jests which were chosen for my entertain
in raent.
â J In place of information, amusement, and
rd what Â«f either had ever before been marked
:ir : with the strong lines of genius-, were allufi
a' oÂ«Â»> puerile, undignified and indecentâand
d, ; melancholy reverse, the bottle supplied the
ft,; de6cienty.
A I He had not returned late from the eonvi
ut : vial board, nor had he accidentally over-ftep
iid ed the line of tempetance m the luxury Â»f a
ch cheerful glass with a few friends at home ;
cd but, with <ach transient (lunger or acquain
â  tance, or fwr want of even that apology,
had nearly finilVed, end a/ear, the
and difqualifying foiitn.
Curjcd bottle, that enftel.les, lays pu.
trair, add i:i ruins, the grealeji minds, t\->
pofei to view their weakneflVs and vices;
g tcs cause el triumph to their cnenfies,
and of lasting sorrow aiid regret to tin. if

and sullies the evening of an ufeful, and c;l *
honorable day.
Hail! ti> the cheerful, companionable,
healthful, temperate glass. But curie on
the enervating, dtllruCt ive, babilual bottle.
Intemperance has so long been the tbeme
of the moralist, that perhaps much force
cannot be added to the arguments heretofore
produced againit it : in all its stages, in all
its varied forms it is odious, difgulting, and
deftruftive. I mean only here to point at
its eflefts, on such is become its votaries,
and Jits vi&iras, from long habits of indul*
gence, which daily, and a'moft impercepti
bly to thtrmfelves, but not with left certain
ty on that account are dfawn into its inexÂ«
tricable vortex.
To trace the pmgrefs and decline of a
great mind j to arrest its progress to decay
and ruin j to reflore it to its native ftreagtli
and dignity, is the objeft of this little eflay.
If volumes were deroted to the fame end>
