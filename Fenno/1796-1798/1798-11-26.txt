BUONAPARTE'S EXP ED II lON.
Cd" During the present anxiety respeCting
the design of Buonaparte'sexpedition, and
the practicability of the voyage to India,
the following observation on the Mon
soons, extracted from the Bombay Ca
lender must be interesting.
OUR readers will not require to be told, )
that onr year is divided into two grand sea
sons, or as they are called, the South Weft
and North East Monsoons ; that the firft
generally prevails from May to the middle
of September, inclusive, the other during
the remaining months ; yet we must premifc
this as an introduction to what follows :
We need fcrcely to. observe, that during
the South Weft Monsoon, all the ports and
roadfteds on this fide of India deny approach
âso much so that between the 15th of May
and the Ift of September, ships are preclu
ded by their policies from touching upon the
Malabar coast, or from lying in SuratVoads
between the Ift of May and the lit of Sep
tember. Generally speaking the Monsoon
is considered to extend from Dunder-head,
the southern extremity of Ceylon, to the
Persian gulph ; in order to attain which,
they -who (hould fail at this season, would be
obliged to make what is called a fauthern
passage, that is, go firft to the south of the
Equator, before they could (tretch over to
the weft ward , a vayage that would occupy
for Muscat about 40 days, and to Bufforah
about two months ; the fame objection ex
ists Sgainlt failing at this season to ajy part
of the Arabian coast ; as for'the Red Sea,
it is considered in vain to attempt enterjng
it at this feifooânor can i( be said to be
favourable to fail now to the cape, the Mau
ius, or any port to the weft ward.
To die Other fide of India <xt*lie-cÂ»ntra
ry, it is now the mtaft advantagrtms period
of departing. From the middle of April
even to the middle of August, a voyage to
Madrafs may be made in about 12 or 15
days ; to Bengal, from 15 to 20 days ;
after this time it becomes excessively tedious
from the necefiity of keeping to the Eas
tern fide of th* bay to avoid the violent wea
ther on the Coromandel coast ; for the fame
reason the south weft Monsoon is eligible to
leave Bombay for any of the ports in the
gulph of Bengal or the straits of Malacca :
hence also it is the season for failing to Chi
na ; after the 20th of August, howevrr,
what is called the direst passage to China
becomes very precarious, with much proba
lity of finding blowing weather in the Chi
na seas.
With regard to the ports from which
(hips may be expefted to arrive at. Bombay
during this monsoon ; it may be lata down
as a general rule, that'the quarters favora
ble to fail during any season, are those that
it is unfavourable to expeft arrivals from,
and vice versa : hence, from the Persian
Gulph, the Red Sea, the Cape of Good
Hope, and the westward in general, this is
the most seasonable period to expedt arrivals;
from Muscat, a trip may now be made in
10 or 12 days, from Mocha in 20 days,
and Suez in about a month ; it (hould be
remarked, that after September the Red
Sea admits of no egress : (hips consequently
remaining there beyond that time, must
continue there all the north-east moonfon,
and are said to have loft their passage ; on
this account the 25th of August is the
latest day to which our cruisers are allowed
to remain at Suez. From the Cape a pas.
sage may be made in five or fix weeks, from
the Mauritius, in three weeks or a inonth.
The south-west monsoon is also the most
faverable season in which a passage may be
made from Batavia or any ports to the east
ward, through these southern (traits; from
Batavia to Bombay in particular, a passage
may be made in about 35 days. From
Madras and Bengal during the south-west
monsoon, it is necessary to make the south
ern passage in order to'reach Bombay ; this
will require in a passage from Madras, from
30 to 40 days, and from Bengal from 45
to 60 days, frons the necefiity of working
out of the river, and beating down the Bay
to clear Acheen-head ; from the straits of
Malacca it i* in arduous task to fail for
this port, or even to any one in the Penin
sula of Iniia, owing to the difficulty of
wearing round Acheen-head.
We have now to treat of the north-ealt
monsoon, or the season which may be con
sidered as included between the 15th of
August and the 15th of April, in which,
the firft circumstance that occurs to us to
remark, is that our coaik is rendered in a
peculiar manner feaure and favorable to na
vigation ; it is now considered the most eli
gible period for failing to the Persian Gulph,
and irt general to all ports to the westward :
to Muscat the trip is generally 15, and to
Bufforah 28 days. The time suitable for
failing to Mot ha aad Suez, is from the mid
dle pi February to the middle of Match,
when a passage may be nude to tSe firft in
18 days, to the second in 25. If â Â» flÂ»'P he
delayed till the end of March or the
beginning of April, the passage becomes
more tedious, being then obliged to make
th* land to the foufhward of the island of
SoCatra, before the Gulph can be entered,
on account of the southerly winds which
prevail, and a current setting to the north
ward. After the 15th of April, a (hip
bound to the Red Sea would be very likely
to lose her passage.
Between the 15th of August and the 15th
of September, it be considered favoura
ble to fail to Madras and Bengal, but after
this time the season is fufpmdtd. owing to
the setting in of the North-ealt monsoon on
the other fide of India, which closes the
ports on the coast of Coromandel, Golconda,
and Oriffa, between the 15th of OCtober
and the 15th of December, at least this peri
od is excepted in common policies of insu
rance : after this time again a passage may
be made to Madras in 30, and Bengal in
50 days, this season may be deemed unfa
vourable to the coast of Pegue and the straits
of Malacca, but far the straits of Sunda, Ba
tavia, for example, it is the best adapted :
a passage thither may be Dade in 35 days.
With regard to the seasonable imports in
this monsoon, it is at 110 time more advanta
geous than now for coming from the Coro
mandel Coast and in short the whole Bay :
a passage may be made from Madras in 26
days, from Bengal in a month, and Penang
a month. From the Persian Gulph it is no
less favourable, the paffige from Muscat be
ing about !o days j and from Bufforah 28.
The Red Sea is now closed ; nor is it rea
sonable to exprCt arrivals from the Cape or
the Straits of Sunda ; from the latter in par
ticular it isalmoft impoffibleat this season to
make a tolerable paflage.

LONDON, September 18.
The independence which France bellows
upon the Republic? which (he has formed
is, to be perfeflly dependent upon her ; and
the liberty of doing what (he pleases. " You
(hall be King, and I will be Viceroy over
you."
A French Loan has been whispered at
Madrid ; but Don John, who is a sulky
fort of a gentleman at times, declares he
will let it alone.
Amsterdam once so distinguishable for
the firmnefs of its police, and the decorum
of its manners, is said to have now become
the fink of vice and debauchery. Every
street is crowded with prostitutes, and almost
every house is a Brothel.
Wednefaay la 11 upwards of 30c French
prisoners, taken by the Hazard sloop of war
(coming from the Mauritius,) were landed
at Liverpool ;-:amongft many females cap
tured, one heroic Joan of Arc was feei*,
who (food to her gun, and commanded the
mctrduuiig theKCWoii ; her child accompa
nied her as (he marched along guarded by
British soldiers.
It now appears, that the united English,
Ruffian, and Turkilh fleets are to be em
ployed in traafporting from Greece to Al
exandria the army of the Captain Pacha,
who has left Widden, and is on his march
to the Archipelago.
The books, manuscripts, and curiosities
lent from the Vatican at Rome, and the
Library of St. Mark at Venice, to Paris,
have not received any damage in carriage.
The manufcrpts are in the highest preserva
tion, and are bound with much elegance.
Amount the antiquities are, a sacred veffelin
gold filligree, of singular workmanfliip ; two
gold crosses, enriched with precious (tones ;
two golden crowns, one of which belonged
to King Flavius Agilius, and the other to
Queen Theolinds. They are of a circular
form, ornamented with (tones, and were
used at the coronation of the Lombard
Kings, 1 here are also some large tables of
marble and porphyry, with Greek inferip
tions upon them. All the curiosities have
been placed in the Cabinet of Antiquities
at Paris.
We have been told of the immense funis
gained by our Naval Commanders. The
public (hould also be acquainted with their
liberality. The wife of Rorere, one of the
Deputies sent to Cayenne, and one of those
who are now arrived in England, was, with
a great number of Priefti, taken some time
ago by Sir Edward Pellew, in a French
frigate going to Cayenne. She had fold all
her property in France to go to join her un
happy hulband, and had with her about
300Â®!.âSir Edward ha 9 given back to her
the 300 PI. and has paid the sailors their share
out of his own purse.

specimen of the ingenuity of London Edi

The complaint in the Princess Amelia's
knee, is said to yield to the remedies that
are now going on, by the advice of the at
tending faculty, at Worthing, in Suffcx, as
far as refpedts the fears that from a defeCt in
thcfynovia, there would be a constant (liff
nefs in the joint ; but it is doubtful when,
yÂ«ung at-ftÂ»>ii, her Royal Highness will
recover the full dfe of it.
Several accounts have been given of large
floating vcffels, but none equal to the fol
lowing ;âPhilopater, an Egyptian King,
built a vessel of 40 ranks of oarsâmore like
a castle or palace than a (hip ; being in
length 420 feet, and in breadth 72 ; con
taining 4000 rowers, 400 mariners, and
3000 soldiers.
It appears, by a private letter from that
excellent prelate, the bifkop of Killala, that
the expeoces in keeping his visitants, the
French, at his palace, in fix days, amounted
to 5001.
The French geceral who commanded at
'
Killala, told the biftiop, that during all i%.
campaigns he had made with
he had never fuffered so much as in the fn> ii
(lay he made in Ireland.
The Following particulars come from a Ren
tleman who was on the scene of aftioit du
ring the late momentoui business in I re
land, to his friend ill Bath. The circum"
fiances may have appeared in the public"
, papers before, but their being written bv
a private hand, adds to their intercft and
eftablilhes their authenticity.
After giving an account of the furreod
er of the French troops as appeared in tkl
Gazette, he fays, " The rebels who w cr ,
with them, are completely cut to piece, â¢
they were put in the front of the battle bC !
their new Jriends, and from their gre J
slaughter, it it is generally underftaod on
their giving way before our troops, thev I
were cannonaded by the French according
to their plan at the battls of Jemappe Th
French would have surrendered some dav!
previous provided the Irish who were in
their camp, ihotild be included : this l on t
Cornwallis absolutely refuftd, and the del,,
ded rebels in confcquence, had no qU artÂ«
given theai.
Â« You have no|dta how admirably lord
Cornwallis conduits hmfelf ; he adheres to
no party whatever j he lifters attentively to
all, but judges and adls from himfelf
" The limerick m ilitia have gained i mmor .
ho " or 5 tli9 y fuftamed the shock of the
army for upwards of two hours. Col Ve
reker has got infinite credit by it âLord
Roden greatly diftinguilhed himfelf,' and his
regiment behaved in a moll gallant manner.
In the firft charge to animate his men, he
advanced so far before his regiment, that he
fell into the hands of the enemy ; which
when the regiment perceived, they determin!
Ed to a man to retak, him, or perifl, in the
attempt---they accordingly charged again
with such hrmnels and impetunfity, that
they brought off their adored colon*! in
triumph. . This little business has giver,
such an energy to the army, and to militia
regiments in particular, that I verilv believe
were the French to effed another 'landing
they would not keep their ground a second
day."

Carnot, it is laid, resides at a village near
Linti, where, under an affiimed name, he en
joys bare toleration, without the slightest favor
or countenance from the Austrian government.
He is busily employed in writing memoirs of the
revolution, which will difclo'fe many interesting
secrets, and which more particularly will illul
trate those military operations which he planned
and of which the consequences seem likely to
change the whole face ef the earth.
The Roman territory continues to be> dread
fully diftrafled. Troop, are constantly March
ing from qne place to another to quell the dis

has publiQied an order, making every commune

ai -^' v '*V ot out cruizers along the eosft from

threatened at one point, sometimes at another, and
the enemy's forces, much weakened by drafts to the
Rhine, areexpofed to incessant fatigue.

Barbarities of the United Iri/hmen:
DUBLIN, Sept. ?1 .
Wcdnefday night, a numerous gin'g of above
100 desperadoes, entered the house of Mri.
Lamb, near Old Bawn and Tallagh, in thÂ«
county of Dublin, and plundered it of cash,
and every portable article of value it contained.
While the villains were in the house, they ap
peared to be under great apprchenfion, for they
were frequently heard to fay, "Boys, mind the
piquet," which wl suppose was a guard of their
party they Rationed at the outside, to be oJ the
watch. They were goinÂ« to hang a gentlemis
who was a visitor in she house, arid had a re?e
about his neck for the purpafe ; but some lÂ«iÂ»
cruel than their comrades, interfered, and fjv

On Wednesday iaft a poor inoffenfive jsm6Â»

Seme nccounts of the con/litution of Egypt,.
Undtr the government of the Beyt.
Egypt is called a Turkidi Province, but
it is in taft a Monarchical, Ariflocratical,
Military Government. The Beys or Go
vernors of the eighty Provinces have all the
power in their and ftipport thtir au
thority by their confederates, the Mamelouk
foldicry The Sultan, tn.ieed, keeps a
Pacha in Cairo, the capital, but unless he
were to be accompanied with an army, this 1
Representative could not exercise any degree 1
of power. Four and twenty of the most 1
powerful of the Beys compose a kind of '
Divan, wbich communicates its orders to !
the Pacha, which he publishes in the name
of the Sultan. Almost all the BeyÂ» are .
Mamelonks, that is numumitted chriftiai ,
(laves from Georgia, Circafiia, &c. &c. who 1
have embraced the Mohammeda-j religion, Â«
and have risen gradually from the fitua-ion 1
of a common soldier to the rank of Bey. *
The name of Mamelouk i- given to tiiofc j
children who have hern catried off by merch- i
ants or robberÂ® from Georgia, Circafiia, Na<- r
to|iÂ«, and the other provinces of the Otto- t
man Empire, and aftrrwuds exposed to pub- .
lie sale in the public market at Conftantino- =
pie, or Cairo. The Egyptain grandees, who f
themfelvc? have a similar origin, educate t
these children in their houses, and prepare a
them for being their fucccffor* in their dig- t
nities At present these foreigners alone v
can attain the rank of Bey, and be inverted f
with public offices. The law on this sub- '
jest is fÂ» precise that the son of a B;y ne- \
v.r can succeed to his father's station. Com- v
monly the sons of the Beys enur into the ar- f
my, and the Divan assigns them a conlide- t
rable revenue. J
Almost all the Mamelouk' are sprung j
from chriflian parents. After they are pur- {
chafed, they are comp lied to embrace the ;
Mohammedan religion, and learn the Tur- r
kifh and Arabian languages. After they r
liavc leatnt to read and write, thty are 111- f
itruiSed in the Koran.
From their earliell youth likewise, the '
Manelouka are taught to ride, and the ex- ! j
orcife of the fpenr, the fibre, and other v
arms. Tbey are conllantly exercising in i
military evoiutionc, ir.ured to the heai of the
climate, and to rndur â  the parching drought
of thedefarts. By these exercises they at- 'â¢
tain health, vigour and courage I > order '
to make~good soldiers they only require to
be iflftrufled in European taAics. At pre- i
lent, however, they fight without any kind ; v
of order, and are totally ignorant of artillery. ' p
The number of.the Mameloaks is from 3000 Â°
to 6000. ! 3
When the Turkish emperor Se/im,'in the
year 1517. conquered Egypt, he endeavor- \ s
ed (to preserve this important conquest) to f !
gain the favour of the Mamelouks. For a
this reafoti he made little alteration in their si
form of government, and in a treaty of peace I 1
granted them great privileges. By this trea-1*
tf Â»he Beys were authorised to fufpenii from P
his office, and denou te to the Pope, the ;
Pacha, or Viceroy ot the Sultan, if he hap- j
pened to incur their displeasure, or was guil- ] -
tyof any encroachment on their power. By
this treaty likewise, they were boatid annu- 1
ally to pay the sum of 500,000 ajlani to the ; !'
Porte. This sum was afterwards raised to
800,000, or about 150*0001. fteiling âThe ! 3
Beys, however, commonly retain great sums
for the repair of the canals and fortifications, â 
and do not temit the half of it to Conflanti- r
nople. Befidts they are bound to supply a ,
ceitain quantity wheat, and nearly 150,0001.
for the support of the tomb of Medina, 1

of Mecca. Upon thele conditions was r
the unlimited authority of the Beys over
all the inhabitants of Egypt recognized. I f
Ihe Beys are sensible of the advantages r,
of their fituati n, and abuse their power most
groflly. A Pacha retains his authority on
ly while he favours their views. If he at- *
tempts'to defeud the interefls of his raafter
or the Egyptians, he is immediately confi- ,
dered a traitor ; the Divan assembles and n
fends him about his bufi ;efs. The Beys ,
wl\o are at the head of the provinces and of
the troops, accordingly have all the power a ,
in their hands, and the people is completely â 
fubjeffc to their arbitrary will

0 THE public attention hat been called during
s tke part week to the flagrant and atrocious fadl
e Â°f 'be existence of < fnciety of United Irishmen
!t in this City. The meeting which gave rife to
our remarks, has doiibtlefs been held, and the
0 prOposed plans agreed on. Inftsad therefore of
e relaxing in our attetit\ui) to thel'e defipns, there
is a manifeft call (or inufejfed v'gUance. Their
e apparently iooffenfive lie'tgnaficW <jught by no
n meant to deter us fromTufpecflmj; them of the
0 most bloody purposes. Whe:i I beho'd a man
, evidently plotting mv de ru&ion, it is of but
[j little import whetker he ftrikc under the name
of in*highwayman or jn U ited Iri/hman, a 1
c burglar, or j peep o" day boy, an a (Tallin, or a
Defender. Ihe fangsinary watchword assumed
by this daring gang of outlaws, should arm eve
ry man in de[eftation and abhorrence againfl
the'n, and every United Irishman ought to be
punted from the couivrv, as much as a wolf or
a tyger. for a more bloody and remorftlefs
band of organized alTiiTins never polluted the
fountains of society. As there is little doubt
e that delegate* attended at tins meet ng from the
e affiliat societies of New-York and e fewhere,
- the attention of the Editors of public papers'
? will be profitably turned to ascertaining this
1 Whether any and what Irifh.nen of no
. torions charadler have recently left the place,
what the ofUnfihlc, what the probable bnfinefs
they could have in hand these are points
which ''emand the attention and co operation of
- spirited aid well dilpofed citizens generally, in
- exploding the d.vkeft and mod nefarious conspi
racy, which -ver yet found abettors in America.
T I have a lift of members of the societyâto this
' I (hall always be happy to receive additions.â
Fafls, also, identifying the memherfhip of anv
individual whatever, will be ufeful and necefia
- ry. When as complete as I can make it, the
f names of the whole of them (hall be published,
. from the gloomy, close-working, cut-throat
looking son of Galen, to the fatuitons and fpat
c tering Bookl'eller, though the knives of the
* I whole bloody gang were at my breast. Similar
lifts should be cdleiUd every where, and the
r villains dragged forth to light. For light to them
â  is death.
e
t When their majesties of France, invaded Ire
. land, they set forth one of their objefls to be,
r the restoration of the Irish to the unrestrained
3 enjoyment of the Catholic worship, for that
I they themfelveÃ, being Catholics, the talk would
*I be peculiarly grateful to them. To the Pope, 1
1 j when they invaded his territory, .unbounded
. profeflions of refpecl an"! reverence were held ,
> out, and he was acknowledged as U)e legitimate <
) and divine Pastor of the Holy Catholic Church '
, Universal. To the Muflelmen, they exhibit
themselves in the light of true believers in the '
Mahometan faith, and Suonaparte would no
' doubt perform aÂ« many genuflexions per diem, â¢
r as Abu Bekr is said to have done, to get poflef
r fion of the treasures of Conflaotinople or of
: India. Thus these blaspheming Frenchmen,
. I amidst all the aberrations of their infidelity, '
t prove that thÂ«y i-aaietnber at least one paflage in
- the Bible, by becoming W/ things so all men.
" j Some people are led to fuppcrfe, that be
'j cause the Arabs are a loose and disorderly
banditti, that the army of Buonaparte) be
[ ing so powerful and well-appointed, must
' triumph overall their efforts. But there are
' a number of eircumftances. abftra&ed from
E the consideration of physical force, which
! | mud operate the deltruftio'n of the French.
' j A celebrated traveller (who was afterwards
sent by the Dire&ory, to find how the wind
blew in America) tells us, that from March
to November, the heat to an European, is
[ almost infupportablc,âthat dur ng this
' whole season, the air is inflamed, the flcy
sparkling, and the heat oppreffxve to all un
r j accuflomedto it. The southerly winds are
I by the natives called " poisonous winds."
Â® These are of such extreme heat and aridity, ;
that nd animited body exposed to thenj can
withfland their fatal influence. During !
the three davs that they generally last, the <
r streets are defe t d ; and woe to the travel- ]
j ler whom this wind surprises remote from
shelter. When it blows longer than three I
P days, it is infupportablc. The inhabitants <
are often almost blinded by drift* of sand. '
All these comforts mud be peculiarly accept- :
able to an army accustomed to contend with i
no other oppoiition thao the force of the
feeble and effeminate Italians, or the dif- ]
pirited and broken legions of the Emperor.
Besides, it is the very disorder of the Arabs; (
which renders them fotmidable. They are ]
an invisible enemy. Mounted on horfej as
fleet as the wind, and seldom moving in a
large mass, they beset their enemy in small ]
I dttachments beat up his quarters, cut off ;
his convoys, and harrafs hi* men with in
ceflant alarms. It is in vain they are pur
sued, and the nature of their warfare ex
empts them from the poflibility ot defeat.
The emperor Julian marched an army of ' (
50,000 men agaiuft barbarians of the fame [ j
nature, chara&er, and, in part, of the fame !
country. His foroe was felefted from the t
flower of his army, and the belt appointed of j
the empire. A rapid tide of success marked j
his career, 'till, arrived at the Banks of the <
Euphrates, he was prevailed on, by some
irifidious Zopyrut, to destroy his fleet and j
transports. Julian still advancedâbut he
advanced to deftruftion. The barbarians
inceflaÂ»tly hovered round him, and were $
no sooner dispersed on the one hand, than I
they appeared in greater numbers on the I
other. Irritated at the vexations of an ene- a
my he deemed contemptible, he attacked, j
dispersed and ptirfued them on all fides, af
ter killing immeofe numbers of them. In |
three days Julian was no more; and his ar- j
my. reduced to one quarter of its number, c
capitulated with the depifed enemy. The â¢
fate of General Braddr.ck and his army, of
General Harmar, of General St. Clair, are Â£
inllances (trongly in point, and demonstrate c
the inevitable dangers that attend a remote t
warfare a lavage or barbarous enemy, t
Discipline is no qualification to an army c
that has to contend with such enemies ; the J
gre.ueft veterans beccrac the surest prey* j
f
L Whoever give# to these confiJeratiuns their
true force, must be persuaded that the
mighty hofl of Buonaparte, long ere 'his
day, lie scattered lifelefs o'er the sands of
Egypt; and I only wish.that instead of 30,
he had 300,000 mtn with him.
The fix fallowing flutes have ratified, in
'he following order, the amendment to the ;
constitution, proposed by the state of Mas
sachusetts,âand wh ch goes to the exclnfion
of foreigners from the office of President .
and Vice Prefid;nt, and from a feat in either .
it house of congress, vir.
Massachusetts, j
New-Hampshire,
New-York, ,
f Rhode-Island,
Vermont ar.d one other.
So that the 4nal adoption of thiÂ» salutary J
and necessary amendment to the Constitution r
may be considered as certain.
Mr Gallatin doubtless views with much 1
concern the approaching period t<r his patri
otic labors. How cruel was it to lay a plot -
whi' h must inevitably cut short the melliflu- J
ous warblingi of his tuneful tongue. j
With whatever reluftance the horrible ex
ample before our eyes may induce us to '
view innovation, everv patriotic American J
must rejoice in the proTpedl of having exo ic J
revolutio izers excluded from our councils,
at a time when we find the in rigues of our
own varlets a match for all our watchful
nefs and energy.
The miraculous traveller, Eruce, tells
uÂ« of a euftom, prevalent amongfl the E- 1
gyptians, of cutting fleakes off the haunch-!
es of live cattle. This practice may prove j
extremely convenient to tht French under j
Buonaparteâlt is certainly extrpmely con
genial to the humanity of their natures.
It is supposed by some, that owing to
the famed fertility of Egypt, and its abun
dance in corn and every kind of grain, the â 
French will find little difficulty in supply
ing an army of 30,000 men. But as the .
harvell is in the month of March, and Bu- ,
onaparte's arrival took place in August,
> these calculations are probably deceptive.
The second Seflion of ths sixth Con
gress, commences in Philadelphia, this day
j I week, conformably to the Constitution.
t , ; â:
i The French prisoners confined at New
, Castle, attempted lately to break jail, but â¢
' were restrained by the vigilance and aftivity â¢
' of the keepers. It is not improbable they
; had received intimation of the design to
t transport them back to their blessed land of
. liberty, and that they were animated to ;
> this attempt by a desire to escape the difa- '
, greeable destiny. â¢
f A gentleman contends that the Babarity
' of an enemy can be no source of alarm to
' the French ; as this has long been a conspi
cuous trait of their republicanifjn, hav
ing, by long praAice refined it itito system,
. they are unquestionably the greatest Barba
r riai.s in the Univerft. ,
t We are happy to find that the serious ]
: attention of the citizens has at length been 1
i turned to an objeft of the lafl importance

ExtraS of a letter from Wilmington, North
i Carolina, dated Nrvember 3d, 1798.
! " Since my last, almost all the remaining
part of this unfortunate town, has been ileftroy
ed by fire. It broke out about two o'clock in
the mornii.g, in a large house ntcupied by one
â¢ Parish, nearly adjoining Henry (Trguhart,which
destroyed all that square up to the market, and
down to Mailer'sâthence icrofs to the square
of which my store made a corner, and swept
the whole up to Berquin's large house, one or
two small buildings excepted, 1 suppose about
one hundred and thirty. Sixty houfes j
ware-houses ar.d stores were consumed. ll
flopped at Bernard's, without consuming his ,
