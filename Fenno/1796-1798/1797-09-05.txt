Wilmington, Sept, id, 1797.
Dear Sir,
Shall Ibe permitted so far to trespass U
pon your time, as to alk you to state tome
in a letter by an early port, the symptoms
: which characterize the contagious fever now
or lately prevalent in you* neighbourhood"in
Philadelphia, for I have although not in
pradice seen a cafe of a little girl so denomi
nated, who fc fever had been Of five day 9
continuance, and waa at the time to which
I refer attended with no great degree of fe
ver, very little yellowness of the eyes, skin
perfettly clear, with little heat, clean tongue,
no pain in the head, and very little sickness
of stomach, (altho' both these last symp
toms haft existed, but went off without
bleeding.) She had over the whole furface
of her body a miliary eruption oÂ£ a bright
red appearanceâl am the more induced to
a(k you for a correct defeription of it, as
some cases are said to have occurred here in
persons flying from Philadelphia, which has
occasioned some alarm, indeed more than it
necessary. At this time of general fright,
every disease, is fufpe&ed to be the Yellow
Fever, and is consequently the tjccauon of
alarm.
Pray what is the state of the disease in the
City, our,nccounts <jre so various and con
tradictory as to render all rational conclusion
impracticable.
With very fmeere withes for your health
and welfare, I am your obedient servant,
HENRY LATIMER.
]Qr. William Currie. *
/[ Phi adelphia, â¢ September 4th, 1797,
/Dear Sir,
Time onljrferves at present to inform you,j
that tho contagious fever at present in this?
city, generally attacks suddenly, without
previous sense of debility, with pain in the
fore part of the head and in the knivs, and
often in the back, accompanied with consi
derable sense of cold, (and in more violent
cases with great ftirfture about the region
of the heart, and diftrefsful anxiety and
restlessness) but no rigor or (hivering.
In many cases the eyes smart like a burn,
and are as watery as if the patient had been
weepingâmore or less redâbut seldom
yellow for some days : the face appears
slushed ; the skin feels hot and dry ; 'the
pulse quick, tense, and confined: symp
toms worse in the afternoon and. fore part
of the night: bowels eoftiveâfeldom any
sickness at stomach or inclination to puke
for the firft two days.
A complete inter-million takes place on
the third or fourth day, and the fever -re
turns no moreâor a considerable remiifion,
succeeded by coldness of the extremities,
and an incessant desire to puke. In a day
or two later, the matter puked up or dis
charged by stool, appears black, unless
comatose symptoms come op, which is
often the cafe. Coma is generally succeeded
.hy fymptQiTls of scurvy, which finally ter
minate in profufe hxmorrage, vrhfeh pnrÂ»
a period to life.
The remedies which have molt invariably
succeeded, when employed frofn the begin
ning of the disease, have been', blood-letting
repeated to a third or fourth time at pro
per intervalsâtwo bleedings frequently an
swer ; but where the inflammatory symp
toms are manifeft, it has been found to be
ufeful to repeat it in the height of the pa
roxiftrw to a ninth time, and in one cafe
eleven times. In addition to blood-letting,
mercurial purges have produced unequivo
cally good effects.
In cases where vomiting has come on,
calomel in doses of 2 grains every two
hours, or at longer intervals if it Ihould
occasion too copious evacuations. At this
period, blisters to the stomach and wrists,
or to the infidc of the thighs, have also con
tributed to the relief of the patient. The
patient is still, on account of the irritability
of his stomach, reftriÂ£ted to cooling and
diluting drinks, and prohibited kinds of
nourilhment except what can be conveyed
in glyfters. In cases where the vomiting
cannot be restrained, a yellowness gradually
pervades the eyes and skin of the patient,
and at length a matter black as ink is either
puked up or evacuated by stool, and in a
Ihort time after the patient dies.
After the reduflion of the inflammatory
symptoms, when mercury, either taken in
ternally or applied externally, affefts the
salivary glands, the patient generally re
covers.
The disease is the very fame in kind that
we had in 1793, rendered different in degree
by the difference of the season.
About 200 persons have â¢ already been
affefted by it; of these betwten 6o and
70 have died, including 27 that were sent
to the hospital at different stages of the
disorder.
Among others we have to lament" the
death of Dr. Way, whose talents you know
in a certain branch were conspicuous, and
who on that account will be much miffed
as well as regretted.
The disease has not gained much ground
for some days'paft below the new market,
which is the part of the city where it firft
appeared, owing I believe to the line of
communication being cut off by the removal
of the inhabitants :' but as it has infmuated
itfelf into other parts of the city, there is
no reason to exped it will be entirely extin
guilhed till the appearance of froft, by
which the contagion, whereby it is propa
gated, is as certainly destroyed as the moll
tender tropical plant. Rain and cool wea
ther, though they have some controul over'
the contagion, never entirely destroy it.
A few instances have already occurred
of persons who had been cxpofed to conta
gion, having taken the disease after removal 1
to the country. If any such cccur at
W[lmiugtoDj {hall thank you to let me
know it.
I remain^
With fentimcnts of sincere regard,
YÂ«?ur friend and humble fervapt,
V/m. CURRtE.
Dr. H. Larimer, lVihningioni.
For of the United Statues.
REGARDING the insult which the
Spanish minister, the Chevalier d'Yrujo, has
offered to the. government of the United
States, by his Jjtte audacious appeal from its
adminiftratiou to the people, as alike intend
ed to subvert the happiness s*d abftradi from
the dignity of our country, and being aware
of the motive.? which have prompted this
pernicious purpole, I feel myfelf called on
to affisrt that /hare 0$ the right, which ap
pertains to each individual citizen of the
American community, to avenge the insult,
and to expose its author not merely to the
contempt of the people, against whom he
has meditated so foul a wrong, but to the
crimination of his proper fovercign, whose ef
feptial interests he has deeply wounded by
his unwise and ridiculous condudt.
And here I will Venture to predidt that,
if those interests, and the injury they have
fuffered on the present occasion, are well
understood and justly appreciated by the
court of Spain, it is by no means impossible
that the translator of Smith's Wealth of.
Nations himfelf.be translated to one of
the more immediate sources of that wealth ;
where a practical acquaintance with the sub
division of labour would give him a clearer
idea than any he has yet acquired of his
original.
When this minister undertook, by a con
temptuous appeal from the proceedings, of
the executive department, to debase that
branch of our government in the estimation
of its citizens, he either was or he was not
acquainted with the ftrudture of the govern
ment, and its relations to the people, for
I whose uses, and by whom, it had been infti
i tuted.
If acquainted with its nature and relations,
he could not be ignorant that his appeal
was not only a diredt and daring violation of
all diplomatic rules, but a gross and humili-.
ating insult to the people themselves, from
whom the Executive of the United States
immediately emanates ; and whose elective
fandtion, so recently given, (hould have
(hielded the objedt of their choice, and the
representative of their authority, from the
rude impertinence of a foreign agent. If
this minister was not acquainted with the
nature of our government or its relations,
but blindly, though wickedly, plunged into
a mcafure the whole tendency of "which he
did not csnprehend, and the consequences
of which he had not calculated byond the
quantum of ftcret fervicc money which it might
enable him to draw from hit employers, then
there can be no want of charity in pro
nouncing him a very undignified and un
profitable agent for his mailer, and a very
indecorous and dangerous inmate of the U-*
nited States.
The part which he has adted, and the
unworthy insinuations which he has dared to
utter against the Executive of the United
States, have excited a spirit of indignation
throughout this country, which, if the
of its government were not purely
pacifis, and scrupulously neutral. would re
alize all the apprehensions, which he has
affedted to entertain, and in less time than
his uncombining int,elkÂ£t has been led to
imagine.
" An astronomical apparatus," to
the transportation and use of which no per
mission would be alked of Spanish governors,
might be carried to the Mississippi, which
would give such lines of demarcation as
have net yet been contemplated.âBut an
inviolable refpedt for the faith of treaties
will bind the United States to the diie ex
ecution of themâand so far the interests of
the Spanish nation will yet be fafe, not
withftasding the insidious counsel of her falfc
friends, and the unjuftiflable conduit of her
filly fervaats. She will adt wifely, however,
in disclaiming such servants and such con
ductâand, profiting by the present lesson,
Spain, if her dearest concents are consulted,
cannot fail to cultivate with gÂ«od faith, and
through an able agency, the friend/hip of a
people, whose enmity, provoked to action,
would instantly subvert the empire of her
colonies, and fink her consequence in the
scale of nations forever.
DENTATUS.
From the N. T. Daily Gaz.
We have attentively perused the remarks
by Obfervator upon the paragraph in -our
Gazette on Tuefdaylaft ; and, though he
is ostensibly right in the conftruftion he be
stows on Haley's letter, and really so iu the
animadversions he makes on the principles of
our American Jacobins, yet we cannot help
thinking he does not fufficiently extend his
views, as well with refpedt to the diredt as
the collateral consequences and influence of
the condudt of that foe to America. Tho'
the intention, as avowed in the letter, is to
feizethe property of his " detested enemies,"
it does not follow thattheEnglilh are exclu
sively to be the vidtims of his malice. It is
believed that Americans are meant to be
robbed, as wall as his " infernal enemies."
There-are, it is well known, in this country,
men real native Americans, who are no ad
mirers of the sanguinary excesses of the
Frenchâthese, by such fellows as Haley,
are branded with the nameof 7or/fjandArif
tocrats though sincerely attached to the
freedom and independence of the United
Statesâand men of these descriptions- are
expressly named by this " consummate vil
lain," as among the number whose property
he meanp to depredate onâThis is certain
ly no strained conftrudtion, for the letter ex
plicitly declares it. Bcfides, a single con
iideration without the aid of any other,
stamps his condudt- with the mark of hostili
ty to the United StatesâEvery one who
knows any thing, knows, 'that the capture
of the Hare raised the premium of Insurance
last spring from 4to $ per centâand per
haps, if; calculated, this Angle
item would amount on the imports of l&ft
Spring to at lead 3 or 403,000 dollarsâ
Surely such a sum is fufficierit to (hew that
so Safe a measure as Haley is chargeable
with, and which was the result of delibera
tion, is evident and diredt hostility against
the United States âlt may be said the pre
miums are insured as well as the capitalâ
and that they will be paid togetherâ>goodâ
but though this may appear plausible it is
not folidâlt ought to be the cose, but is
notâT<fe instance of the Severn taken into
Brest, where the cargo was condemned, is a
cafe in pointâa large proportion of that
property though infursd in England, is still
unsettled, and like to continue so to all eter-
feveral infured there, have
been carried into France this spring, the in
furanee upon which the underwriters refufe
to pay, because the vessels were unprovided
with a role d'equipage. The loss in these
cases fall of course on the insured. We are
authorized also to infer from recent ac
counts that the whole of what is alledged as
causes of condemnation, are mere pretexts,
notindeedoriginally conceivedby the French
themselves, but suggested to them by un
principled Americans for the purpose of en
abling them to plunder with impunity the
j property of their defenceless countrymenâ
; and of this abominable class is Haley : His
1 letter ihews him to be utterly abandonedâ
and a man possessed of such a mind, may be
fairly fufpedted of the blackest defignsâln
short, it is pretty generally understood, that
the defedtion of this wretch, was not ip or
der to attain revenge from his " detested in
fernal enemies," but for the purpose of en
riching himfelfby feizingand appropriating
through the inftrumtntality of the French
maritime courts, the property of English
men and Americans without diftindtion.
This we believe is generally understood, and
every circumstance warrants the inference.
From an European paper.
SKETCH of POLITICS.
It is a curious circumstance which cannot
have efc # ."d the observation of those who
have traced the French revolution with an
attentive eye, that many of those momentous
events which have, in a great degree, decided
the fate of Europe, have been influenced by
a combination of fortunate occurrences ; and
i that the success of many of their principal
j operations which have contributed to the
1 establishment of the French republic, has
j neither resulted from wisdom in confidera-
I tion, depth of judgment, nor extent of po
| litical forefight. The elements alone gave
the French pofleffion of and secured
j their navy from deftruftlon on the coast of
Ireland ; while the hand of death j.who might
1 justly be termed the tutelar deity of the re
public, by snatching the imperial Catharine
from the throne of Ruflia, when on the
1 point of adtively co-operating with the allies,
I enabled them to obtain the advantages that
marked the last disastrous campaign.' But
in no one instance has their goodfortune serv
ed them so essentially and decisively as in
- the feafqnable conclusion ofj>eace with the
emperor. Fourteen hours after the prelimi
nary articles had been signed at Leoben, a
courier arrived at Vienna with dispatches
from the emperor of Russia, who had been
just crowned at Mqfcow, containing the im
portant communication, that an army of
18o,oco Ruffians bad received orders to
march to the afllftance of the imperial af
mies in Italy and on the Rhine ! These
troops too were to be paid by the Ruffian
monarch. A reinforcement so decisive must
have given an immediate change to the whole
face of affairs. The expulsion of the French
from Italy would have been certain, and it
is highly probable that, ere the conclusion
of the campaign, they would have been re
duced lo the necessity of retiring within their
ancient limits. How much then must Eu
rope deplore the superabundant afid impro
vident caution of the emperor Paul, in ne
gledling to give some private intimation of
his intentions to the court of Vienna. This
step would have answered every purpose, by
inducing Joseph to adopt a defenfive fyftcm,
until the arrival of the Ruffian army, and by
averting, at the fame time, those dangers
which Paul was fearful of incurring by an
open avowal of his designs before the cere
mony of his coronation had taken place.

NEW-YORK, September 2.
Last night abc\it 11 o'clock, a young
man returning home, was accosted near Lif
penard's grounds by a man who ordered
him to at the fame time presenting
a pistol : he ftized the robber by the fhoui
der, who immediately fired : fortunately the
pistol glanced aflde ; but his coal, waistcoat
and shirt, were much burnt by the powder.
On feeing he did not fall, the robber whitt
led, as a signal for his companions, when the
young man, apprehetifive of other attacks,%
thought it prudent to make his escape.
From several late instances it ii evident
that a gang of thieves is lurking about thi'3
city, and acting in a tnanner that deserves
something more than ordinary vigilance to de
test and trace them to their source.

COMMUNICATION.
The valuable American East India ship,
mentioned in a Hamburgh article yesterday,
was taken by a privateer belonging to the
celebrated Felix Coffin of Nantes. He has
agents in this city and other parts of the

seizing American vefTels.
September 4.
The following we believe to be the au
thentic particulars relative to the barbarous
treatment received by the fhip'Fame, of Phi
ladelphia, from a French privateer.
Yesterday arrived at the place,
the ship belonging to MefTrs. Oditr,
Bosquet and brothers, Capt. Robert Wil
few, who failed from the Capes of the Dele
ware on the 27th ult. bound for Havre de
Grace, with several French ladies and gentle
men pafTengers. Capt. informs us
that on the 29th, inlat. 38, 30, Sandy Hook
beinpr distant about 60 leagues, he saw two
brigs, one of which gave him chafe ; at 11
A. M. finding he could not escape her, he
shortened failâat half past 11, the brig be
ing within eannon shot, and having no co
lour hoisted, fired a shot which wounded
Madame Fatan, a lady pafTenger, very fe
ver<*ly, by carrying away half her bread, and
bfoke her arm in two places : They then
boarded the ship, and commenced to ransack
her in every quarter ; finding part of an
English flag on board, they laid hold of two
â¢ French negro boys, and threatened to hang
them if they would not diÂ£clvÂ£Â«.fome parti,
culars refpetting the ships papers âthe elder
boy gave them 110 fatisfaÂ£lion,but the young
er being intimidated, said that the
had hid his papers. They then commenc
ed a second search and finding nothing to
induce a further detention, after stealing
from the captain a pair of gold knee buckles,
they fuffered him to proceed on his voyage
at 7 o'clock P. M. Capt. Wilson through
motives of humanity to save the life of hi 3
pafTenger, landed her, with her husband in
this city'on Friday, in the afternoon ; and
we are happy to understand, by surgical
aid, there is a probability of saving her life.
When they firft came on board Captain
Wilson, they called th.e brig Eagle, and said
she was commanded by capt. Marrew, but
when capt. Wilson asked them for a certifi
cate to shew that he had been boarded by
them, they said her name was the Camite,
Capt. Marret. She mounts 14 guns and is
full of men.
Capt. W. has noted a prÂ®teft against the
above proceeding, before Teunis Wortman,
Esq. Notary public,,of this city.

Extra# of a letter from a very refpeilable mer
cantile house in London, to a gentleman in this

" We think it right to remark, for your infor

your eoaft baine much infelled by French priva
teers, and of several American vessels having been

guineas per cent, and we fear it is not likely to be
lower the present season, unless the negotiations,
now going on at Lisle, Ihould end in an immedi
ate pea<e (which does not here seem to be much ex
iiefled :)i n which cafe insurance will soon fall to
the o!d premium.âThe critical situation of affairs,
in this refpea, and the general apprehensions en

BALTIMORE, September j.
All the various enormities of the old world
during its late convulsions, have been more
or less felt in the new. The revolutionizing
phrenzy, the prostration of all'law and or
der, and the total disregard of everything
human and divine, which had feizedthe one,
have also infefted the other. Robberies,N
murders and aflaffinations, art now becoming
the order of the day, towards the close of a
desolating war in Europe ; and the greatest
vigilance of our officers will be required to
check the infernal mania in our'own coun
try. Pick-pocketing, countevfeiting, high
way robbery and murdering are geting so l
( frequent, that scarcely a mail arrives -which |
does not relate some recent horrid instance. j
Let those whose business leads them to tra
vel from home go well prov ded ; and let
the officers of jnftice exert themselves in ap- '
prehending andbringing to punifhmcnt those
faring offenders. Nothing else have we to
hope from,, in the present Ante of society,
to cr*fti such dangerous practices.
A tnojl daring Rqbbkkt ! ! !
A gentleman on his return home from
Philadelphia, was yesterday flopped on the
road between this city and Ellicott's Mills, !
in broad day, by a foot-pad, who seized his
horse's bridle, and presenting a pistol to his
breast, Ordered him to deiifer. The
gentleman put his bancl into his pocket, but
finding the fellow off his guard, gave him
such a blow with a loaded whip, as to dag
ger him very much : He then drew a pistol
froth his holders, which he was fortunately
'provided with, and shot the villain through
the armâthis brought him to the ground ;
but he was molt unluckily prevented dif
patch'ing him on the spot, as his horse, af
frighted at the flifh, and report of the pis
tol, ran off near half a mile before he could
take him up. When he returned to the
scene of aÂ£lion, which he did as soon as pos
sible, he found one of the comrades of the
robber dragging him out of the roa<j with
on<hand, and holding the pistol other.
Not knowing how numerous the gang might
be, he thought it unfafe to hazard another
rencontre, and proceeded on to the mills,
where he related the affair. We are sorry
no measures were taken to pursue those dan
gerous and daring disturbers of our high
ways : if there had been, we should proba
bly now have the pleasure of announcing
their committal to prison. The wound
which one of them received, we hope wiH
lead to a discovery. They were both dres
sed in gingham coats, and their appearance
was tolerably genteel.

By a letter from Raleigh to a gentleman

Blount was lately in that place, and remained
there about 2 days; that he had taken his
departure privately, and it was not known
which way he had bent his courfe.âÂ«We are
told that he said the objeft of his intended
plan was the conquest and plunder ef the
Floridasâthat Mr. Lifton nor the British
government never .countenanced the scheme
âthat as it was a matter of as much im
portance to them as it was to him, they
would hereafter regret their backwardness
1 âthat fearful of meeting the wrath of our

There appears to be a difference bet ween the
reports of Dr. Currie and several other phy
sicians, and Messrs. Girard and LoWnes,
â¢ respecting the exiftene'e of cases of yellow
fever in Southward. This difference may
be easily accounted for. MessrS. Girard
and Lownes have baen accu'ftomed to fee the 1
yellow fever, in the year at Bulh-hill
only, where, fr*"n the mdde-of treating it,
the disease put on its mod malignant and
terrible fuch as obllinate vomit
ing, coldness and yellowness of the (kin,
! languid pulfe,'purple spots and black vomit
ing.âBy the mode of treating the disease,
now used by Dr. Currie, and all the phyfl
cian9 in Southwark, viz. plentiful bleediDg
and purging, all those terrible And malig
nant symptoms are prevented, and the dis
ease in a few days is made to put on the form
of a common mild fall fever. The decep
tion here is natural, and should be pardoned
in men who are not acquainted with diseases,
or the effects of certain medicines upon the
human body.
When a man possesses an eager anxiety
to establish any point, he will often times'
substitute his withes for fa&s, and milled
by the vagaries of his own heated brain,
will pursue the ignis fatuus of his own cre
ating, till it leads him into errors, contra
dictions and absurdities.
Thus has it been with citizen Bache :
In his labours to shed an obloquy over the
administration for concluding the treaty
with Great Britain, the great advantages
daily accruing from which grieve our fo
reign and domestic enemies to their inmost
fouls, this patriotic typographer has revers
ed the old law of nations, and brought for
ward several new codes, (as absurd as any
fiftion of his (hallow brain must ever be)
which be would impose on us as a substitute
for the worm-eaten volumes of antiquity ;
he has brought forward treaties concluded
under circumstances wholly oppolite to
ours, and totally irrelevant to onrown cafe,
as examples to (hew that our treaty was not
so favourable as it might have been : but
in a recent instance which he has resorted
to, he has made a rr.iferable figute indeed.
After giving us an extrafl front the last
treaty between England and Russia, which
I will suppose to be just and true, he infers
from a principle there laid down, that a
shade is cast over the American chara&er
by her having ceded to Great Britain a
right which Russia reservesâalthough that
principle is identically the fame with that
on which Great Britain grounds her prac
tice towards us. The article expressly
cedes to her the right> for which (he has
uniformly contended, of availing herfelf
of the services of her Own fubjetts, Kfchere
ever found. Yet this imaginary difference
is made the ground of a reiterated denun
ciation of the whole government, by this
insolent calumniator. In looking for" (hades
on the American character,** I find none
deeper than the difgraceful career oi the
editor of the Aurora. y
But if there aftually existed thedifference
which this factious mifreprefenter- insinu
ates, it would in truth be no stigma upon
us that Russia had extorted what we failed
in obtaining. The difference in the two
eases is obvious. It is of little moment
that Britain guarantees to us by no express
ftip'ulation, the security of our own citi
zensâThe very existence of such a fact
would be a reploach to our national dig
nity. It is enough for us that Che does not
â¢attempt to invade those rights. The fadtibn
reiterate {heir clamours about three or
four instances of impressment of natives, as
long and as often as they pieafe, ft ill the
assertion may be boldly proclaimed, that
no nation 'can ever more'fyftematically re
fpeÂ£t the rights and privileges of another,
than Great Britain does tlfofe of America
at this day.
, But it is needless to offer to men of sense,
any notices of the groundless calumnies with
which the Jacobin prints abound. Their lies
are not designed to meet the eyes of citizens
of this class. No, they -havc their cue ; ,
ind employ' them whei'e
more sure and certain effeft. Whether those
whose minds can be moved with a profpeft
of danger from the effeft ef the malignant
(landers, feattered by the industry of the
Jacobins, their authors, thro' all quarters
of the country, will ever turii their atten
tion to adequate antidotes, ere it be too
' late, seems at j?refent doubtful. Cures are
generally preferred to preventatives.
, A meeting,'tis said has been called in
Virginia, for the purpose of recommending
amendments to the State
[Should salutary alterations take place, it
may-be hoped they will have some influence
in restoring to political founduefs of mind
a majority of the Congreffwnal Members j
from Virginia, and operate to diftand that
phalanx of faftion which has so long dis
graced the ancient dominionâa phalanx, one J
of whose file-leaders [Giles,) his declared
that he has no confidence in the Govern- 1
mentâwhile at the fame time himfelf and
followers have been pursuing a conduct that ]
has rendered them unworthy the cortSdencs

STAGES.
THE public are requcfled to take notice, that
the partnership which has far some time fab
filled betweaa Mathias Slough of Lancaster, and
William Geer, is now diftblved: but, not as M.
Slough infinuatesto the public without just cause ;
as will more fully appear by a letter on the fub
jed from M. Slough to W. Geer, dated the 19th
December last. a recital of which is not now deem
ed necessary. Atoy gentleman who wilhes to be
more circumstantially informed of the merits of
this bulinefs, by applying to W. Geer may have
the perusal of M. Slough's letter, and then can be
at full liberty to determine whether or not W.
Geer is not perfectly juftifiable in attaching him
felf to any other person in the prosecution of the
Stage conveyance from Philadelphia to Shippenf
urg, or any other place.
Now from tbe liberal and generous support the
public were pleased to confer on the firft effort in
this business, VTilliam Geer, in conjunction with
Messrs. Reily, Weed and Witmer, is determined
to profecutc and carry it on, with every care, at
tention and dispatch that a zeal to oblige the pub

The above company, who are amply provided
with carriages, horses, and every appurtenance to
render the paflage fafe and commodious, inform

CAUTION.
WHEREAS a combination of men in this
county have undertaken to enrich thÂ«m
felves.by fabricating titles to sundry valuable trails
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New
Yoik, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for whiah
trails of lsnd large sums of money have been paid
to theft- fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers *
It is therefore ju.l that public information fliould
be given, to the end, that the injured may feck re
drefi while the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have been discovered are Tru
man Harrifoa, Joseph Witcomb, fa id now to rc
fide in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several otheri who go under fi&itious names. It is
supposed that the lauds offered frr fa Won thofejFa
bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thoufaud
dollars. Such as we have afiual knowledge of are
as follows': Lots No. II and 11, Â©tfegs patent,
thousand acres each, the aAual property of William
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and lames AveriU
and others, Â»i this State. There is Tome grounds
to fuppofc that the lauds of Richard WelU and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchaling those lands, as also to de
prive those men in future from imposing on indivl
du&fs, which their education and aildrefs have en
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has beta
a fhopkeepcr of fume note in this country.
The following affidavits will set in a clear point
of view the wickedness of those men, which when
the public have perused, will induce them to ei
cufc the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego.July agth, 1797.
I Thomas Kelly,of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to Ggn a
deed to them, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, which
was the property of William I Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others ; and further the hid Joseph
and Truman did persuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made out on the icth day
of November, 1793, or set back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the name of
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fiflitioui nam-,
there being no such perlon there. To this I mako
voluntary oath. TIHOMAS KELLY.

On the 19th July, 1797, cameperfonally before

two of the parties abovementioned did make ap

winter of 1796, to make them a deed for two thou
sand acre? of land in the Otego patent, and pro
mised this deponent a (hare of the profits, on the
sale of said lands, for his so doinÂ£ ; and that they
madeapplicationfcveral times for the fame purpose,
which ferrices this deponent as often refufed, de

could do no such thing ; whieh daring attempt on

X-j on the 19th inllant, a negro man by the
hameof DICK, about twenty-five years of age,
and five feet nine or ten inches high; by trade
a carpenter, and is a very lively brisk work
man. His countenance is very goodâWhen
spoken to, he coiiverfes with ease and confi
dence, and is pretty sagacious. I purchased
tlw said fellow of Mr.Dubney Minor, in whose
name he has teen advertised in the Kichmond
newspapers. During his last runaway trip (last
fummcrj he was employed a considerable length
of time, by fomc peri'on near Dumfries, from
which circumltauce, I conjecture, he has taken
another nothei n route I focewarm all perfoas
from giving hiro employment, of any kind
whatever, and maftersof veflelsand otheis, from
rarrying him cut of this Hate. The above re
ward will be given if he is taken within forty

proportion to (he 4iftance he may be brought,
or the trouble and expctice the'appreheilder may
be at, in bringing him to this place.
