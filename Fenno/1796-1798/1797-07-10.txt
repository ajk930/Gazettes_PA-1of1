The Commifiioners
carrying into effect thefixth article of tlie
X treaty of amitjr^commerce and navigation, con
cluded between hisÃritannic majesty ana the Urited
States ot America, Â©n the 19th day of November,
1794, having this day conltituted their Board,
pursuant and agreeably to the said treaty, do here
by give notice, that tlwy are ready to proceed to
bufiuefs accordingly; and they desire that all claims
under the said article (which so far as the fame de-
Icribes the cales thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out dday.
They further desire that all such claims may not
only state in what manner the several cases come
within the description of the said article, but atfo
specially set forth the nature of the evidence by
which the claimants refpeStively undertake tofnh*
l'tsuitiate the fame.
Ex!raft from the fu<f article,
" Whereas-i: iÂ« alicdgcd by divers British mer
u chauta, and .ethers his majesty V fubje&s, th3t
debts to a ccofid-rablQ amount, which were bona
" fide contr.idlsd, before the peace, ftrll remain
" owing '<> them by cn>aÂ«Ltor inhabitant of the
st \Jnite<i States; aniÂ«h*t by *h* operannv ot v;>
* 4 rious lawful impediments, (irÂ»ce the peace, not
" only the full recovery of the said debts has been
delayed, but alfothe value and Security thereof
<c have been in fcvcral inftunces impaired and leff
if tned, so that by the ordinary course of judicial
<l proceedings, the British creditors cannot now
" obtain and a&ually have and receive full and
" adequate compensation for the losses and dama
" ges which tncy have thereby fufained: It is a
u greed that in all such cases where full compenfa
" tion for such losses an J damages cannot for what
" ever reason be a&ually obtained, had and recei
" ved by the said creditors in the ordinary courfr
" of justice, the United States will make full and
" complete compensation for the fame to the said
" creditors : but it is diftindly understood, that
" this provision is to extend to such lofffis only as
" have been occasioned by the lawful impediments
" aforefaid, and is not to extend to losses occasion
" ed by such infolvcncy of the debtors or other
" caufcs, would equally have operated to pro
" due? fucn loss, if the laid impediments had not
" exi/ted ; nor to furh losses or damages as have
â¢â¢ been occasioned by the maaileft delay, or ncgli-
or wilful omilfion of the claimant?."

Ihe general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the

| The general agent thinks it his duty further to fug-
I geft that the fcvera! claims ought to be accompanied
and fnpported by the affidavits'of the claimants duly

of the debts claimed, and such other circamlhnces
as may be within their own knowledge relpeftively.

yIDDITION A L REPORT m
OF THE SFCRKTARV OF STATF, F
To the Prefidfnt of the United States, of the pro- ai
ceedir.gs of the offers of his Catholic Majefiy, p<
in relation to the po/ls occupied by Us troops fii
tusitbin the limits vf the United States, the fii
koundarv line, and other matters therewith ai
connected. ai
ON Thursday last, the 19th rif June, I re- ft;
ceived farther dispatches from Andrew El .u tt, g<
Esquire, the comroiffioner of the United States
at the Natchez, dated the tenth of May last, of n<
which an extra& and copies, numbered one, two, cc
and three, are subjoined. By thel'e it appears fe
that a new motive has been afligned by (Jie com- la
mander in chief, the Baron de CarcndeTet, and fe
Governor Gayofo, for ftitt retaining the poflefEon
of the ports of the Natchez and the Walnut
Hills, and for strengthening the fortifications;
viz. to guard againjl an attack by the Britijh
from Canada. This motive being derived from
information communicated to the Baron do Car- â
ondelet by the Chevalier de Yrujo, the minister
Â«f his Catholic Majesty to rhe United States, i'
appears neceflary again to bring before the Pre
sident my, correspondence with the Spanish and
Britilh ministers on that fubjefl. These papers
are numbered 4,5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. w
Although the minister declared he had just pc
reasons for fufpedHng an expedition from Cana- te
da, was preparing by the British against the up- U
per pofls of Louisiana, yet he never mentioned th
a single fail or reason on which his suspicion was to
founded. From allexifling circumstances I ever te;
believed the suspicion to be groundfefs.-'-Aml the 'e l
note of Mr. Lifton, the British miniftert, of the bu
19th of the last month, declares that no such ex- ve
pedition has been or is intended, by the Britilh in
government.
On the 16th of March last, by the President's si*
direction. I enquired of the minister of his Ca- in
tholic Majesty whether the Spanish troops had
been withdrawn, agreeably to the treaty, from P r
the territory of the United States ; and if not, pe
what orders or measures for withdrawing them of
had been taken To this the minister answered, of
on the 17th, of April, that not having for some be
iÂ»iontbs heard from the fiaron-de Carondelet, fie tic
was " deprived of any information touching the fe'
Jleps taken for the execution of the treaty."
Nevertheless he had previouflv informed the Ba- fr<
ron dc Carondelet of his suspicions of a projected tli
expedition from Canada ; for on the firft of May
it is offered by Governor Gayofo, as a new rta- : so
foil for continuing to hold the posts. These two 1 gr
letters are numbered 10. 11. [ to
On the 14th of June last; the minister of his , Sf
Catholic Majesty wrote me the letter number ia, u;
in which he undertakes togive the substance of toi
t\y" letters from the f iron de Carondelet, and th
which about a week before lie had orally tnmf- pi'
lated to me from the Spanifti originals These en
letters (as appears by the .let Ail of them now gi- to
veil by the minister) exhibited divers complaints nu
against Mr Ellicott, whose conduct is a&gned a s j
1_ t.ife cauft of an a,ieJge<i be
tween him and Governor Gayofo; and fit' the
delay in the running of iiÂ»e boun
dary line.
One article, however, tlie miuifhr has omit
ted ili his recital-. The Baron dt Carondelet
" complained, among other things, that Mr. lilii-
H cott had not given hen notice of his arrival at
the Natchez, as the comnJiHionf r on the pari of
the United States, for running the boundary line
â between their territories and those of Spam. I
, was afton ; fhed at this complaint, as I had then ly
ing on my table a copy, of Mr. Eliicott's letter
to the Baron, dated the 27th jof February, only
ic three days after Mr. Eliicott's arrival at the
in Natchez, announcing his arrifal a* the eommil
Â»_ fiwntr of the United States for th* objctSt above
() exprtffed, and two copies of the Baron's answer,
dated at New-Orleans, the firft of March ? one
of the original Spanish, and other a tranfla
) tion in English, acknowledging the receipt of Mr.
J -â  Eliicott's letter, and " congrajqjating hiro on hi 9
le arrival in that country in the character otf com
h mifiioner on {fie part of the United States." I
y- immediately presented these copie.< to the mini
,e " er > in whom the repugnance of fail to assertion
excited the natural feufation: but soon rectlledl
ing himfclf, he made this apology for the.Baron,
]' 'hat hefuppofedhe did not coilfiderMr. Eliicott's
1- letter as official I This Icttcrand the translation
of the Baron's anfw'er, have been already laid be
j. fo.e Congress and published : I now subjoin the
j copy of the Baron's answer in Spanish. No. 13.
The facls I have heTe Hated, relative to the
complaint of the Baron de Carondelet, which
le the Ppanifh minister has offiitted in his detail, ap
-0 peared to me important to be laid before you, to
it be ccnfidered together with the other complaints
a which the minister has recited. As to the cora
n plaint that Mr. Ellicott " attempted to get pos
session of the Natchez Yqrt by surprize, and that
the Governor Gayofohas in his power documents
which evidently prove the intention of that at
tempt," I haveexamined the two gentlemen who
'â¢ have brought Mr. Eliicott's difpatchts' and they
I- declare that they never heard of such an attempt
beingmadeer intendedby Mr.Ellicott; and that
< 0 fofar from exciting diflatisfaÂ£lion to the Spanish
government, in tne minds of the inhabitants at
the Natchez, he uniformly recommended pa
tience and fubmiflion, until the Spar.ilh jurisdic
tion (hould be withdrawn.
e Upon a view of the whole correspondence now
t and before submitted to the President, it appears
I, that the governors of his Catholic Majesty, on
n the MifTifipi, have, on various pretences, poft
t poned the running of the boundary line, and the
withdrawing of his troopt from the posts they
occupied within the territory of the United
r States: That after repeated overtures, promises
- and appearances of commencing the execution
- of the treaty between the two nations, in both
j those refpedh, their condudl demonflraies, that
t I for an indefinite period they mean to avoid doing
either: That there i> but too much reason to be
lieve Mr. Eliicott's suspicions well founded, that
an undue influence has been over the
Indians by the officers Â»f .his Catholic Majesty,
t to prepare them for rupture with the United
f | States; thofefufpicions cprrefponding with other
1 intelligence recently received by the Seiretary of
, i War and by me. Mine is by a private letter from
j | Colonel Sargent, the Secretary of the territory
northwest of the river Ohio, of which an x ex
trait, No. 14, is annexed.
Whether this plan of exciting the Jndians to
i direct hostilities against the United States, has,
1 been contemplated and promoted by any of our
f own citizens, it may be difficult to fay ; but that
one or more of those citiiens have proposed and
j taker, measures to detach the southern Indians
from the interests of the United States, and to
destroy the influence of the public agents over
those nations, and thus to defeat the great objefls
of their appointment, the chief of which is to
preftrrve peace, is certain. The evidence of this
important faift will be laid before you by the Se
cretary of War. That evidence having a refe
rence to the Britilh Minister, and his government,
I took the liberty of addrefling to him a letter,
â¢ dated the ift instant, ( No, IJ,) to which 1 receiv
ed ;9e answer, No. 16.
At closely connected with this business, I lay
, before you the copy of my letter, No. 17, dated
s the 27th of April laft,to Charles Jackson, Esquire,
. the Diftrill Attorney of Georgia, Reciting a pas
sage in a letter from the Spanish Minister, dated
the aiftof April, declaring his pofitiveknowledge
that the English had made proportions to Gene
ral Clarke, of Georgia to obtain his influence in
that state, in conjunction with some persons who
might make a diversion or serious attack against
Florida. By Mr. Jackson's answer, from which
- an extrail. No. 18, is herewith presented, it ap
, pears, that after diligent enquiry, he could not
s find any person that knew any thing of the bu
e Gnefs, or that entertained a belief of the kind ;
b and that from General Clarke's known violent
antipathies to the English, and other circum
- fiances, he doubted the truth of the report alto
, gether.
s On the 30th ult. I received a letter from Ge-,
f neral Piuckney, dated the 9th of May, which
, contains the latest intelligence from him, and
s seems proper to accompany the other papers now
- laid before you. His letter, No. 15, therein re
-1 ferred to, has not yet eometo hand.

| SIR,
1 SINCE my difpatJies by Mr. Knox, the
whole of the Spanish 4fommifison for the pur
l pose of running the boundary lines between the
. territory of his Catholic Majesty, and tlat of the
. United Sta'es has afrived ; but notwithstanding
I this circumstance, I fee no appearance of getting
1 to business in any reafouabW time : various pre
tences are resorted to by the Baron de Cupnde
let, and Governor Gayofo, to juflify the aelay ,
but the true reason, I am well persuaded, hasne
. vet* yet been made known to myfelf, or to the
1 inhabitants ef the diftriil of Natchez, who are
generally very uneasy, and many of them con
i fider t'hejr situations as desperate if not lupported
. in a few months by the United States.
1 As the arrival of the whole Spanish commission
1 produced no effc<Â£l favorable to our business, I ex
, pedled that of Lieut. Pope, with a detachment
1 of about forty troops, which happened the 24th
, of last month, would make some change for the
; betterâin this I have been disappointed. Addi
; tional labourers werefet to work in the fort, and
several more pieces of artillery mounted.
' On the firft of this month I received a letter
. from Govtrnor Gayofo, a copy of which, with
I the answer, you will find inclosed.
On Sunday last, the fort at this place was rein
forced by about forty men, and a company of
1 grenadiers are on their way, and hourly expeded
to join them. Yesterday Mr. Gillimard, the
Spanish surveyor, an engineer, and several other
, military officers, with a boat-load of entrenching
: tools, left this place sos the Walnut IlilJs, where
1 the works are to be immediately put into a com
â¢ plcra state of defence. The la-murers who were
â¢ employed by the direflion of Governor Gayofo
to go 1 n the line, are now ordered to the Wal
nut Kills to assist in repairing the fortifications.

mation which I have lately received from a source
to which I cannotavoid giving a degree ofcredit,
but a (hort poriad wid elapse before we fliall be
ordered to leave this place', if not the cotintry.
I ha ye in a form:;r communicrvon mentioned my

rupture with the United States, and to awe
into a quiet fuumifiion the inhabitants, of this'
diftriil, who are at their mercy. lam furry,
that no has yet occurred to make
me change this Opinion.
Immediately upon Mr. Pope's arrival, he was
joined by ensign M'Clary, who, commands my
escort, which conflfts of about thirty-seven men,
and ail with me. We now make a

Pope has hitherto jcondu&ed himfelf in such a
manner as to give general fatisfadlion to the
neighbouring inhabitants, without incurring the
displeasure of the present governor, or his offi
cers,'and at the fame time supported the honour
of the United States ; but he has unfortunately
been indisposed almost ever since his arrival.

[No. IV.]
Sir,
THREE days ago I declared to you the just
reasons which I had for fufpefling that an expe
dition was p.eparmg on the lakes, on the part of
the Englilh, the objeft of which is to attack Up
per Louisiana, and take by furffrife the ports of
St. Louis and New-Madrid. The proofs which
I have since been able to obtain, confirm me in
my suspicion, that the English troops, who me
ditate this coup de main intend to descend the
Miffiflippi by Fox river, Oniconfin, or by the
Illinois, or other parts of the territory of the
United States. I suppose the government of this
couatry toojealoui of its rights to fuffer so scan
dalous a violation of its territory ; but having al
ways in view the interests of the king my matter,
and the security of his poflcfiions in this part of
the world, in his name I that in
Tirtue of the information cited, this government
may take the measures neceflary for preventing
th.e passage of foreign troops, of what defecti
on soever, over its territory.âAn undertaking in
which are united the dignity of the United States
and the security of the poffefiioits of a friendly
natioD, allures me beforehand that the adminis
tration of this country will take the mealures
which (hall he most adapted to this end.
With these rrafonsl offer myfelf to your dif- j
pofal, and pray Ciod to preserve you many years.

CHARLES MARTINEZ de YRUJO.
Philadelphia, id of March 1797.

CONGRESS.
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES,
Thursday, July 6.âContinued.
Mr. Nicholas declared, he was as rea
dy to aft upon the bufineTs as any person in
the house, and gave as much credit to the :
charge. He wilhed to probe the bulinefs to
the bottom. He thought they should en
quire whether there was not another person
equally culpable with William Blountâhe
meant the minifter.
He suggested the propriety of deferring
the whole bufmefs till next session, as he did
not fee any advantage that would be derived
from determining upon it at present, except
it were by making an example of the offend
er. He supposed there would be no danger
of his escaping ; and if he were to escape,
he did not know that it would make any
canÂ£dcrable difference as the only punish- ;
ment which could be inflifted upon him,
would be a difqualification from office.
Mr. Gallatin said this fubjeft was al
together new to him. He never had turn
ed his mind to the constitutional question
with relation to impeachment before this
morning. Of course, what he should fay,
would be more in the shape of queries than
of any thing else, as he had not formed any
decisive opinion upon it. He was not,
therefore, ready to vote upon the fubjeft,
but merely wilhed to submit his doubts to
the eommittee.
It had struck him upon a cursory view of
the constitution, that whatever might have
been tHe extent to which impeachment was
Carried m England, by our constitution, im
peachment in this country must be limited
to the officers of government alone. He had
derived this idea from the two following
clauses in the constitution, viz.
" The President, Vice-President, and all
civil officers of the United States, fliall be
removed from office, on impeachment for,
and conviftion of, treason, bribery, or other
high crimes and mifdemeano'rs." 1
" Judgment, in. cases of impeachment,
fliall not extend further than to removal from
office, and difqualifidation to hold and en
joy any office of honor, trust, or profit, un
dertime United States. But the party con
vifted fliall, nevertheless, be liable and fub
jeft to indiftment, trial, judgment, and pun- -
ifhment, according to law."
It appeared from these clauses, that where
ever an officer of government committed an
offence upon which a judgment of impeach
ment should be had, he wa? also liable to in
diftment according to law, as the extent of
punifliment from an impeachment was a re
moval from office, apd a difqualification to
in future any office of honor, trust, or
profit, in the United States. He did not
think the cafe of Dr. Sacheverell in point.
It was his opinion that by the constitution
officers of the government only were intend
ed to be impeached, and not members of
the legislature. â¢
His tolleague had given it as his opinion,
that a member of that house might be im
peached for his vote, if bribery could be
proved, though the constitution expressly
declares, that no member shall be question
ed Out of the house for any tiling he may
do in his charafter as a legislator. He sup
posed this clause was meant to prevent any
interference of the Executive ; but if a man
were to be called in question for a vote,
though not for a speech, the privilege which
he had always understood that they enjoy
ed, would be greatly narrowed. It ap
peared to him that the appropriate punilh
ment for offences committed within those
walls was expulsion ; and that impeachment
: could not apply to them.
â¢An argument had been adduced in favor
. of impeachment of a S nat j, from that bo
dy's having free access to the executive re
cords. This assertion was not correft ; as
he recollected a cafe iti which the Senate
Applied to the President for certain papers,
which, if they had had free access to his re
cord, they would not have had occasion to
have requested. He also recollefted that the
request was only granted in part. He be
lieved indeed that feme Senators, as that
feme members of that house, might, by
special favor of the secretary of state, have
access to this record ; but he believed it
might be refufed to the members of either
house.
It was said this offence was the feduftion
of an officer of the government. He knew
nothing of the offence ; but he saw no rea
son why the offence should be greater be
cause committed by a Senator. He knew
not whether this Carey, an Indian inter
preter, was an officer nominated by the
President, and approved by the Senate. He
knew nothing of the faft. It was therefore
necessary to have feme further information
on the fubjeft. ,
With relation to the letter itfelf, it was
of a very serious nature, so serious, that
though he conceived it fearcely ripe for le
gislative enquiry, he thought it called for
Itrift executive enquiry. He thought they
should know something of the faft that the
letter was William Blount's. It was nothing
less than a conspiracy between a number of
men in the United States and the British
government. He said a number of men, be
cause the letter mentions a captain Chef
holm, who held the correspondence with the
British minister at Philadelphia last winter,
so that at least two officers of government
were acquainted with the plan. [He read
an extraft from the letter.]
It appeared, therefore, that a most serious
plan had been laid, in which captain Cjief
holm was a partner, and made the instru
ment to confer with the British minister ;
that a man of feme consequence was gone
to England, and that the design was an at
tack upon the Spaniards in America ; so' that
the plan, if carried into effeft, must involve
us in a war with tjiat nation. This plan,
Mr. G. said, had been fufpedted by the
Spanifli minister at Philadelphia, who has
addressed our Executive more than once up
on the fubjeft ; and also by thev ministers of
France and Spain at Charleston, who, in
order to meet the atuck, had purchased all
the arms and ammunition they could meet
with, and sent them to Augustine.
How far the legillature should go into the
business, or whether it Ihould be left to the
executive, he did not know. At firft, he !
thought the fubjeft wholly of an executive
. nature.
Mr. G. observed, that what he had de
livered were mere curfoiy thoughts. He
should with to hear the fubjeft difeuffed, as
,he should attend more to the arguments of
gentlemen in that house, than to the ppini
ons of legal authority. So far as to the le
gality of the question, they were certainly
better judges than he ; but as the power of
impeachment was committed to that house,
they certainly ought to judge for themselves.
He mentioned this, because he thought the
answer of theie legal gentlemen very curious,
" that the letter <was evidence of a crime ; that
this crime ivas a misdemeanor ; and that it is
liable to impeachment." When the President
alked advice what he should do, the answer
seemed to be a direftion to that house, what
they should do ; and this was advice unasked.
Perhaps, however, the answer given to them
was only partial. He wished, if it could
be done with propriety, that the . business
might be postponed till the next session.
He ur.derftood that the gentleman supposed
to have taken his feat in the Senate this day.
As to expelling him from his feat, that
might be done now, and when that done, it
would prevent him from doing any further
harm. s The difqualification might take
place at the next session as well as the pre
sent.
Mr. I}ana said, that the firft impression
upon his nu'nd were, that a Senator was not
impeachable ; but, upon farther inquiry, he
had found reason to doubt his opinion.
He asked whether a power could be im
peached for any offence, which was not a
violation of official duty. He thought this
was clear by the constitution. A judge was
certainly a civil officer, yet, if he were guil
ty of treason against the United States,
" by levying war against them, or adhering
to their enemies, giving them aid and com
fort," this would be no breach of official
duty, and yet he might certainly be impeach
ed for the offence.
Another enquiry was, whether members
of the legislature were officers, in the sense
of the constitution. This was an enquiry
of great importance.
' The right of impeachment, seemed to be I
a right clearly politicalâit was a right in
government to protest itfelf, by displacing
from her councils men who were faithlefs
and unworthy. Taken in this view, the
reason of the thing seemed strongly to apply
to the members of the legislature.
With refpeft to a k'giflater being a civil
officer. He would ale whether, if a man
was displaced from a civil office, he would
be eligible to be eicfted as a member of the
legislature. 1 liis would be an absurd con
cluflon, unless.it fhoiild be said that to be
elected to such a was neither to be
in a place of honor, trust, or nrofit.
Another clause of the coflftitution faidâ
that no title of nobility shall be granted ;
and rio person holding any office of profit
or trust, shall accept of any present, emolu
ment, office, br title of any kind
from any king; prince, or foreign state
Aiig it was not meant to be said, that
our officers were not to be allowed to receive
emoluments, &c. the members of the legisla
ture were not forbidden to do it. This
would be strange doctrine. Â»
He would submit to the committee what
he conceived to be their duty. He thought
the house should be fully fatisfied of the faftj
but if there was any doubt as to the flagran
cy of the offence, or the liability of the per
son to be thus tried, these doubts should te
left to the decision of the Senate, as the pre
per constituted authority.
As to the enquiry relative to fads. The
committees did not conceive that that en
quiry ought to extend to a foreign minister.
They had nothing to do with him. He
did not come within their cognizance.
Mr. D. thought there could be no doubt
ns to the faft of the letter being' really Mr.
Blount's, as several persons in the house
could prove his hand writing. It was ne
cefTary firft to enter into this general resolu
tion. Afterwards fpecific articles of im
peachment could be prepared.
