Dieppe, 30th April, '97.
Â»Â«aÂ« lit,
I take the liberty to inform you of my present
situation âWhen I left you in London, lift Janua
ry. for France, my dcterminatio'.i was, to obtain a
French commiflion, in topes tt get revenge from
my infernal enemies ; and my good friends in thii
coÃtitry granted my rÂ«quÂ«ft. Whet I retnrned
to London, my intention vrai, to cut forae
vessel out of the Downs, but by good luck, you
had not le't London when I returned, and you
was good enough to offer me the commaud of the
Hare, which I thought would be a good opportu
nity for iib, at I well knew the principal ptrt of
the cargo belonged to my detested enenrei, to fay
the English, and all the cargo insured in London,
among the reft of the robbers. All this business I
kept to myfelf and after leaving the infernal tory
land, by virtue of my eommiOion, 1 foundafafe
port in France, called Dieppe ; my intention was,
t6 have the cargo condemned, but had not an idea
of the fhip'fharing the fame fate; however, that
is the cafe* and if I was tp fuffer ihip wreck, you,
nor no other republican fhouid fnffer on my ac
count, but at prcftnt it is out of ay power. I ex
pefi the darsnei tory party would cut/ny throat, if
in their powi r; however, as long as I live, it will
be my only study to annoy them, and jf the war
continues, they may think themselves lucky if jhey
dont get another bite from me. I hope you will
excuse me for taking this liberty with your fljip,
and hope you may get her restored to you. I wifk
you would fend a copy of this to London, as I am
afraid they have forgot me j but they may reft as
fured that ! have not forgot the Old Jersey, and
those damn'd violations committed on me in Lot
don, and other parts of thtir infernal domin'ons.
Although the cargo of the Hare, does not fall into
my hands, it falls iuto the hands of the republicans,
which ii the people that 1 delight in.
I am, Sir,
Your most obedieb t servant,

remain amount to about 100, with four field piet

men ; that they were treated wjth liberal hofpita'i

County, at the Court House on Tues
day the Bth day of August, 1797, (it
being Court day) convened by public no
tice given by the Sheriff of the said coun
ty, to conlider whether the constitution
of Virginia required revision and amend

pursuance of a resolution of the General
Assembly. The fubjeft was taken into

Resolved unanimously, as she opinion of
this county, That the faidconftitution is de

Signed by order of the meetingt
JAMES TAYLOR, Chairmari.
JOHN PENDLETON, Juii.
Secretary.
A few of the most prominent defeats in the
constitution of our stateâSubmitted to
the meeting for consideration.
I ft. The inequality in the representation.
For inltanceâCaroline havingabout 20,000
people, hag no more representatives than
Warwick, having about 3,0c0 : and this
mequality.is felt in a greater orlefs, degree by
every county in the state. '
2d. The limitation of the right of fuf
frage to freeholders. This excludes the ma
jority of the citizens from representation,
which it unjust, as they pay taxes, and are
liahle .to military feryice. This injustice is
aggravated by the mode of taxation which
ConjÃxfs have adopted, all their taxes being
laid consumption, and not on property :
so that those who have no land, 'pay â as much
as those who have. The taxes on fait and
spirits bear hardest on tke poor, for they
consume most of those articles ; they ought
therefore to have a vote for those who im
pose them': and by the Canftitution of the
United Statei, those who vote for the most
numerous branch of the State Legiflaturea,
are intitled to vote for tht members of the
House of Representatives in Congress. Un
der this article all freemen in most of the
states have such a vote, and why should most
of the Freemen in Virginia be excluded ?
The inequality in the Senatorial dif
trifte is already enoimous, and daily beco
ming more so.
4th. rhe militia officers hold their offices
during good behaviour, whereas they ought
to hold them during pleasure ; because it is
the firft principle of liberty, that the mili
tary Ihould be dependent ou the civil pow
err, and because military officers for life are
a fort of priviledged nobilityâare the next
step to hereditary diftindtionsâand art, of
course, incompatible with republican prin
ciples ; ours is the only state in the union,
and probably the only government in the
world, where such a thing exists ; and it
defeats one of the checks of the Constituti
on Â«>f the United States, which, whilst it
girea to the Prefidentand CongrefÂ« tbr right
of commanding and regulating the militia,
leaves to the ttatei the appointment of offi
cers to fecureÂ«to each state their fidelity ; a
security which is defeated, by having no pow
er of dismission.
sth. A numerous council is maintained
at an expence, for which their services are
n* compensation to the community.
6th. Freedom of religion is so loosely
provided for, that two laws, since the revo
lution, have been thought necessary to se
cure it; one to Manumit the di(Tenters from
the religious government of the Episcopa
lians ; the other to establish religious free
dom. Now this ought to be established by
the constitution ; because if the legislature
had a right to eftablrth it, it follows, that
they ilfo have a right to destroy it.
AUGUSTA, August 3.
The court of inquiry instituted for the
purpose of inreftigating the fatfts and cir
iumftances on which was grounded the sen
tence of the court martial on the trial of the
former adjutant general, met at Louisville,
pursuant to the resolution of the legislature,
and confirmed the former sentence in all its
parts, two only difTenting, viz-âthe honora
blt major general John Twiggs, and the ho
norable brigadier general Morrifon
haÂ» a boaryl of officers been twice convened,
at a most enormous expense to the state, firft,
for the purpose of breaking, and again for
that of restoring, a character whose sole
pursuit fmce his residence here, ' has been to
breed anarchy and confufion. We should
not be surprised if Jackson and
Twiggs would open Sim a plan of hatching
up some other grievances against the meet
ing of the next legislature, by which a few
thousand dollars more will be drawn from
the state coffers.
There is a degree of fupinenef* attached
to ptople even in the moment of danger,
from which innumerable calamities frequent
'j~Tbey will not have seen their error un
til it be too late to offer a salve to the wound
already infliaed. This Imbecility of the
human mind arises from Two causes
by placing ao overstrained confidence in those
who once profeffed to have been our friends ;
and secondly in believing we are at all times,
ready and capable of warding off any unfore-1
seen blow which may. be aimed us. Be
tween individuals thiÂ« doftrine may hold
good, but in political bodies, and in
the itercourfe between nations, nothing
can bÂ« more absurd. There was a
time when it was thought a crime to sup
pose a Frenchman capable of treacheryâca
pable of injuring an American ; but that
time is now no more:âThe American*
have since received abundaut proofs of the
treachery of that peopleâwe fay treachery,
because they have not attacked us as open
enemies, but as assassins in the dark WÂ«
have frequently apprised our fellovr-citizens
1 Â°f the secret intentions of these people in
distributing themselves all over the United
Statesâwe have frequently told tftem that
this intefltion partly consisted in poisoning
the minds of th# people against their happy
government, and partly in instigating a spirit
. of commotion for certain supposed grievan
ce'âthat these things are now fully verified,
is unhappily too true. There are, at thil
time, about a million and a half of French
men within the United Statesâthe calcula
tion is far from being, exaggeratedâWe
appeal to any man who will give himfelf the
trouble to reflect a little, whether this num
ber is not capable of mpch mifchief at this
time âIt is true, we gave them an asylum
from affaifination and oppression, as we would
have done to the people of other nations,
but we did not flop hereâwe clothed, we
fed them; and raised liberal fubferiptions
for their fupportv-although their nation
â was then endeavouring t> yverttfrq fir go
vefnment, We (hewed ourfelvcs above taking
revtnge on the unfortunate. But how have
this very people repaid us ? By every aftion
which could link or degrade the human cha
racterâln this place we have bur (hare of
them j and perhaps trione than we ought to
countenanceâLet fads speak for themselves
When the stage arrivved here this day Week,
a certain Frenchman in this town opened a
letter, and with much alfiduity circulated
the following as part of its viziâ
That Jtfcffrs. Harper, Rutledge and Smith,
of South Carolina, all three members of
the house of representatives, had absconded
in consequence of their being implicated in
the difgraceful design of William Blount;
and that the British consul general was com
mitted to jail. * ,
We know this to be a lie ; becatife Mr.
Smith is appointed minister to Portugal,
and has aftually aecepted that appointment
âMr. Harper is one of the committee ap
pointed to investigate, in the recess of con
gress, the tranfaftion which led to Blount's
design on our government ; and as to Mr.
Rutledge, his chara&er is too' well-known,
and established in this country to fuffer ariy
thing from the animadverfionsfcf aa itinerant
refpett to the British
consul, the executive of the United States
know 3 his duty and the right of nations too
well to attempt the imprisoning a foreign
confnlâHe is in an official capacity ; and a*
such, is not amenable to the civil laws of this
country, he is proteftcd by the law of na
tionsâ such things might do very well in
France ; but at this time they are better
ordered in this country. Whether the a
bove letter was manufaftured by the French
man himielf, or that he received it from a
citizen correspondent, Â£who is, perhaps in
some other part of the union, upon the fame
exprefg errand that this citizen is here] is
perfeftly immaterial to its criminalityâln
either cafe he deserves a quick conveyance
from Georgia.

a 'drifs of Mr. Grattan to his fellow-citizens of

Felloiv-Citlzenj of Dultlin,
I thank.you :or pad favors t have foun lin
you a kitid and gracious matterâyou hav;
found in m'e an unprofitable fertant Uinter
that impression, I beg to allure you, that so long
as the pi efent state of reprefentatior. in tlie Cer'n

fullv decline the honor of fuliciting at you/
hands a- feat in that aflcmbly.
On this principle it was I withdrew from

charge my duty, hi communicating With my
condiments, at the eve of a general eluJlinn,
some fay an immediate diflolution, when I am
to render back a trust, which until Parliament
(hall .be reformed, I do not aspire to re-jfllime.
The account of the most material parts of my
â  eondu<!\, together with the reason of my reso
lution, will be the fubjefl of this letter.
Mr. Grattan concludes this appeal to his fel
low countrymen in the Following wo.di :*
May the King'y power that for'ms.ope tflatr
in our Constitution, continue forever ! but let
l it be as it profefies to be, and as by tfic princi
ples and laws of these countries, it fhouldbe,one
estate onlyâand not ? pow;r confirming one
estate, creating another, and influencing a third.
May the Parliamentary Constitution prosper I
but let it be an opeiative, independent, and in
tegral part of the Constitution, acfvifiiig, coufiu
ing, and sometimes directing the K ; ngly powtr.
May the Houf- of ComradnsftourHh ! but let
the people be the sole author of its exiftenct, as
they should be the great objefi of it care.
May the connexion with Great-Bi itain con
tinue I but let the result of that connexion be
the most perfect freedom,in thefaireftandfulleft
fenf j , of all descriptions of men, without dif
tinetion of religion.
To this purpose wefpokeâand speaking tliii
to no purpose, withdrewâlt remains to add thi>
supplication : Hawever, it may please the A 1
mighty ts dispose of Princes or of Parliamentsâ
MAY THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE

PffILJDEL PHIA,
\VEDNESDAY EVENING, AuguJ 30.
Yesterday, at 11 o'clock, his Excelletfcy the
Governor met both houses of the # Le
gislature in the Chamber of the Senate,
and addressed them as follows :
Gentlemen of the Senate, and
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives.
THE objeft for which the present session
was appointed, being confined, I believe,
to the completion of such bufinefd*as was de
pending at the period of your adjournment,
it will be proper to avoid pressing upon your
attention any fubjeft that does not require
an immediate irtterpofition of the legislative
authority. I enjoy indeed, a sincere fatis
fattion in beirtg able, on this occasion, to
repeat, that experience has disclosed but
few important defeats in the general inftitu
tit>ns of our municipal policy ) while even
those subordinate regulations which are ne
cefTary to accommodate the progress of po
pulation and settlement in a young country,
have, in a great degree, been anticipated
by the wisdom and liberality of your prede
cefibrs. It is another interesting source of
pleasure and congratulation, that, notwith
standing every rccent 'symptom ofdifiatisfac
tion and hoftih'ty, thp conciliatory conduft
which the Federal government haspurfued,
promises effectually to restore the harmony
of our foreign relationÂ®, anito preserve the
peace and prosperity of the Union.
In order, however, gentlemen, to pro
vide against a difappolntment in this hope,
Congress have directed, among other cau
tionary m-afures, that a corps of 80,000 wi
litia shall be organiaed, of which 10,696
men are to be furnifhed by Pennsylvania.
The necessary inftru<ftions have been iflued
for complying with the requisition j but per
mit me to observe, that the imperfeftions
of our militia law, ( which' have often been
the fubjeÂ£t qf femark in my communications
to the Legifiature) forbid the expectation of
certainty or expedition, in embodying a
competent force, upon the present or upon
*ny future emergency. 'ln carrying the
aft for procuring a supply of arms into ef
feft, time has been allowed for transmitting
proposals from the moA distant part of the
Union ; and the delay has enablfd me to
obtain the aid of the Prffident for facilita
ting an exportation from Europe ; to ascer
tain under a late law of Congress, an exemp
tion fromdutyon the importation into Penn
sylvania ; aad, in consequence of the sud
den profpeft of a general peace, to insist u
p6n more advantageous terms, than Could
have been contemplated in an earlier pur
eliafe. The contrasts. will nevertheless, I
trust, be formed, so as to infu're the delive
ry of 10,000 ftaad of arms in the course of
the ensuing spring : But ftrlf, it is obvious,
that the eftablifhmeut of au can be of
little importance, unless the regulations for
mustering a retraining the militfa shall also
be efficient; and therefore, you will excuse
tberenewed exprefiion of my solicitude, that
a reform, may be speedily introduced, on
points so essential to the national honor and
defence.
As the state of the unfortunate controver
sy at Wioming has not been /natfrialty
changed during the recess, T prefurae this
fubfett will, likewise, be revived in the de
liberations of the present session. The
hope was entertained, that a judicial deter
mination in the Supreme Court of the Uni
ted States would, before now, have obvia
ted evtry ground of litigation, even upon
the question of private property ; but as the
ifi"ueâof the fuftsinvolving that question, can
have no direst influence upon the obligation
of the government to assert its right of juris
diction, I again submit to your considerati
on, the expediency of adopting, in that
refpefit, a prompt and decisive course of
proceeding, whether it shall Wad to an equi
table'commutation of either of the contend
ing claims, or to a coercive establishment of
the public authority. The additional do
cuments that I have directed to be present
ed to you, evince the continuance of that
spirit of'refiftance-to our laws, which any
appearances of fupineqefs 01; of irresolution,
on the part of the state, would, I apprehend,
fatally extend and embolden.
From -the many other fubjefts which your
records will exhibit, allow me, Gentlemen
to feleft, as deserving of peculiar attention,
the institution, of public schools, and thf sys
tem for regulating bankruptcy: the former
is recommended with all the force of a cqnfti
tutienal injun&ion, and the. latter, by those
ccinfiderations of policy and humanity which
will naturally occur, at this cfifis, to every
mind of feeling and reflection. Some further
provisions might likewise be advantageously
made, refpefting the interior management
of the prilons'for debtors; particularly in
the articles of lodging and fubfiftance; and,
It is thought,- that the authority of a law is
â wanting, for a removal from the debtoi's
apartment to the criminal jail, when a per
son in custody, upon civil prqeefs, (hall af
terwards be convifted of a crime
The reprefentatipns which have been made
bv the officers of the Land Office, point
out the necessity of an early appropriation
fjr paying the arrearages due for past Servi
ces, and for compensating, in future, a
competent number of clerks to perforin the
dnties of that depa+tment. The allowance
kas hitherto been so infuffieieut, that the
Records, for a series of years, have been,
unavoidably, left imperfect, and even the
â¦xpence of trpife&ing the indifpenCaU^Cur
vent liuftnefs, has been partially defrayed,
as I am informed, out of the- private funds
of the officers. YÂ«u will likewise be pleased
Gentlemen, to prescribe the mpde for dis
tributing 546 copies of the neweditionof the
Afts of Congress, which the Secretary of
State has transmitted to me, for the benefit
of the Common werffth; and Tome use should
immediately be defignat'ed, sos the'hoilfe or
riginally intended to accommodate the Pre
sident of the United States, as, in its pre
sent unoccupied situation, it is greatly ex
posed to dilapidation and injury.
It is proper to t;ike thts opportunity of
Hating, that the eoutroverfy relative, to the
prize (loop Active, which was captured
from the British in the year 1780, has been
revived in a suit brought by certain claimants
against tha then marshal of Pennsylvania,
who paid the proceeds of the priz.e into the
court of admiralty, under *ll order of the
judge, and with the fanftion of the legisla
tive and executive authority of the common
wealth, as appears from'the records of that
\ period. It being incumbent on the (late,
under these circumdances, to indemnify the
marshal, I have directed the suit to b; de
fended on account of the public, and the do
cuments will be laid before you, that fuÂ£h
further steps may taken upon the occasion as
your wisdom and justice shall devise and ap
' prove.
The appearance of a malignant and con
tagious fever in Penu-ftreet anA,its Vicinity,
as the time of your
induced me, gentlemen, to convene such of
the members as could conveniently att#nd,
1 that they might be apprised from the belt
| fourcea of information of the fafts relating
to the fubjeft : but a variety of reasons oc
cuvied to render it improper on the part of
the executive alone to pursue any (tep, that
might prevent your meeting at all, or ( even
change the ordinary feat of the legifiature,
without the previous authority of a law.' fl
aivxioufly hope, however, that the jirecau
tions which have been takeuj and the fa
vorable temperature of the seas n, will ena
ble us fpetdily to remove every of ap
prehension : And that you may, from time
to time, pofTefs authentic accounts upon the
fubjeft, I (hall direst the reports of the
health-office, and the communications of the
college of phyficiane, to be regularly la,id
before ,yÂ«u.
But, under the irtipreffions made by the
calamity which threaten*, you will naturally
be disposed, gentlemen, to invigorate,, by
efery poflible means, the police, for restoring
and preferring the health of the city and its
fnburbs. The existing law hat empowered
the infpeftors to prohibit an indiscriminate
intercourse with the infefted quarter, to re
move the (R, and to provide for their ac
commodation : and you will, doubtless, con
cur in thinking, that the emergency jultifies
me in having made arrangements for estab
lishing camps on the neighboring compions,
as an asylum for such of the citizens as may
wish to fly from the immediate sphere of con
tagion. For the outlines of a permanent
plan, however, permit me to refer to there
port, with which I have been favored by the
college of phyefiians ; a plan which will, I
am confident, be digested and matured by
your wisdom, upon liberal and enlightened
principles, adapted to an objedt so deeply
affecting the tranquility, opulence and prof
kperity of our metropolis. â¢
Gentlemen of the House of Reprefcntatives,
By the report from the department of ac
count!, of which copies will bt presented to
the legifiature, it appears, that to a balance
of 94,718 dollars Cents, which was
in the treasury on the I ft day of January last,
there has been since added a sum of 178,205
dollars and 51 cents, the accumulative re
sult of various sources of our revenue. Du
ring the fame period, the dilburfements for
1 the public service, including the enpenfe of
the late session of the general a(Tembly,-an J
the grant for the relief of our fellow-citiiens
in Savannah, have amounted to the fnm of
176,439 dollars and 1 cent ; so that there
remained a specie balance of 96,485 dollars
and 35 cents in the treasury, on the firft day
of the present month. It should be recol
lcfted, however, that this sum,. and the
growing revenues of the state, are fubjeÂ£ted
to very appropriations, independent
of the current charg.es for the support of
government; and I trust that the next general
aflembly ( should your other avocations pre
vent an immediate investigation) willjndge
to review the fta,tÂ» of our finances,
and to take the necefiary precautions for
preventing the public expenditure exceeding
the public income.
The officers of accounts will submit to
your â¢consideration the ordinary objeSts for
appropriation, which have occurred during
the recess ; but permit me particularly to
suggest, that it"may be proper to mak? a
provisional grant for the use of the health
office, left the progress of the disease, which
at present excites an alarm, should call for
pecuniary aid more suddenly and more ex
tensively than the powers of the infpeftois
could supply.
It will likewise, I conceivS', be an aÂ£t of
true policy, as well as of benevolence, to
provide fame means for employing and pay
ing in the public service the indigent and in
dustrious citizens, "who may be deprived of
the ordinary resources for the maintenance
of themselves and their families, during the
continuance of the calamity.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and
Geitlem. n of the House of Rep refenta lives,
The general information, which has been
received, will not indeed permit me to flatter
you the hope, that the malignant and
contagious fever to which Ibavejuft alluded,
has ceased to exist. It is, I fear, a melan
choly truth, that the number of victims in
the neighbourhood ofPenn street, in South
wark, and in that part of the Northern Li
berties, which is called Kensington, ha 3 un
doubtedly inereafed in the course of the last
week; and some cases, it is said, haveocur
red even in the interior of the City. lam
aware geatlemen, us the painful confequen
ees of these public communications; but I
have thought it aÂ» iudifpeuisbk duty, iu aj
I matter of such moment, that'every individu
al {hould have an opportunity to judge for
andtopurfue the measures which
his own ideas of security might suggest.
To the lufpedtora of the Health-Office, how
ever, as more intimately acquainted with
the state of the various parts of the city and
its suburbs, T have implicitly confined the
talk of deviling regulations, to check and
prevent the progrtfs of the contagion'; and
you will pq[Â£eive by the Proclamation which
I have issued at their earned jrequeft, that
whenever they have thought it necessary, to
a!k my aid, their plana have received the full
support of the Executive Authority. Those
plans (which in mod points coincide with
the Opinion with the College of Physicians)
certainly corttain arrangements that will af
feft the feelings and the interests of indivi
duals ; biit our Fellow Citizens will perceive ;
with their usual candor and good ferife,that I
on oceafions like the }>refynt, perfoual con
federations must be superseded, by an atten
tion to the welfare of the whole community ;
and it is great consolation to refleft, that the
power is ex rcifed by men chosen by them
selves for the purpose; by men whose duties
eipofe them to extfaordinary dangers with
-ojt the exemption from the operation of the
roles they establish; and by men whose vigi
lance, judgment, and humanity ,-entitle them
ta public confidence andVfteem.

ALBANY, August 2j.
By Major Cafs, of the United Statei
â 3d regiment, who arrived in this city oil
Monday last, we are informed, that he left
Fort Hamilton, on the Great Miami, the
15th of May last, and travelled through
the North-western Territory to Detroit ;
that as far as he could discover, the Indi
ans (hewed no hostile disposition towards the
United States, although their minds ap
peared to be much agitated, and many of
them were moving off to the Spanish fide
of the Miflitlippi. The fpint of desertion
which had prevailed amongst the American
troops'at Detroit, had considerably abated
previous to his departure, in consequence
of energetic' measures being adopted by
brigadier general Wilkinfon. Great cor
diality subsisted between the American and
British officers in that quarter.
BOSTON, Augnft 25.
We learn by an arrival at Newberry, that
orders had arrived at Curracoa, frorfi Gua

that place, is a ffbooner mounting 14 guns
and enrrying 70 men. Th? conduft of the
crew since her arrival, it is said, has excited
some fufpicioÃS, that her visit was not for
the purpose of bringing dilpatches. And
we are informed, one sailor, either whan in
liquor or from receiving fomeaffront, threat
ened to inform the Selectmen of Marblehead
of the real design, which he hinted to be, to
gain information, what Indiamen were about
failing, or were expe&ed home ,-Â»*3nd, that
to form a pretext for entering our ports,
which might prevenr suspicion of the objeft
âthey emptied the water from the calksâ
befides the fpeciout one of bringing dispat
ches. The sailor alluded to, aftually quit
ted the veflel, and the other seamen were
so much enraged, that they menaced him
with death, if be attempted to return again.
He was yesterday seen on the road from
Marblehead for Boston.

CAUTION. ,
WHEREAS a eombination of men in this m
county hivo un '.ertaken to enrich thÂ«m- j tl
selves, by fabricating titles to sundry valuable trail s h
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New â  o
York, Philadelphia, London anu Paris, for which v
trailp of lsnd large sums of money have been paid f'
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers â¢ ''
It is therefore just. that public information should 4
be given, to the end, that the injured may seek re- 1
dress while the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have beÂ«n discovered areTru- j
man Jofeph Witcomb, (aid now to re- (
fide in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and Â£
several othert who-go under fi&itious names. 11 is (
supposed that the lauds offered fcr sale on those fa- c
bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand c
dollars. Such as we havÂ«a<Slual knowledge of are t
as follows : Lots No. II and n, Qtfege pstent, f
thousand acres each,the a<9ual property of William
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64. ' c
fatije pstent, thousand acres each, the property of i
Mr. Chaumonr, now of Paris, and ames Avenll

to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their j
management.âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, aÂ« well to caution tKe (

prive those men in future from imposing on indivi- :
