HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
ij Wednesday, May 16.
ock (Continued from ytjlerday's Gazette.)
n, Mr. Gallatin laid, it appeared to him
d that both the gentleman from North Carolina
last up, and the Speaker, had considered
this fe&ion in a very different point of view
8 from that in which it had been stated.by other
,ck gentlemen. Both of them considered these
volunteers as a part of the militia. The
Speaker, when alluding to the militia of N
he Jersey, bad (aid they were organized com
panies, or armed associations. He also con.
aio Â®dered these volunteers i'n t'ie fame light,
,jll when he spoke of them as an advanced guard
at _ of the militia. And the gentleman f;om N.
ich Carolina when he spoke of an amendment
nd which he intended to introduce, evidently
considered these volunteers as a part of the
mili'ia.
ck Other gentlemen, however, Hated- that
these men were not to form a part of the
ft militia, but of the ariny o.f the United States ;
ck thac if they were militia, they would not be
volunteer aflaciations, as law compels militia
, e y Â» that the diltin-tive feature betwixt
lc gulars and militia is, that the latter are
obliged by law to serve, and the former be
jf- come soldiers hy their owi consent. The
id spirit of the fvftion is, Mr. G. said. not
that these volunteers should be a part of the
miliiia, but of the army. The associations
Id to whrch it alludes are perfeftly diftiuft from
,;t she militia. If they had not been considered j
& in this light by the Senate, where the bill \
ys originated, they would not have provided i
er that the officers of these corps (liould be ap- !
m poi ted by the President ; and until what
:a te " from the Speaker and the gentleman
d from North-Carolina, in relation to their
,<j being a part of the militia, he had no idea
e. I their being considered in that light. In
le I deed, the Speaker, at the fame time, obferv
j ed, be should objedl to the amendment fug
e, gefted by thegentleman from North Carolina,
; to make the fjftion clear in this refped ;
therefore, though he called them a part of
r ' the militia, both his arguments and the spi
rit of the feftion, prove they are not really
y considered as a part of the militia. It now
d from a belief that these corps were intended
f" to make a part of the army, that he objefted
to them, and (hewed that if they were to be
considered as militia, they might become
y so, without any new law, aa there are vacan
d cieS fufficient to embrace all the volunteers
i- who may offer, in the volunteer corp* which
are or may be attached to the militia of the
Â» several dates. In support of this opinion,
[_ r .' an extract from the militia law,
[_ which enaÂ£ls that there shall be at leall one
company of light infantry attached to each
r battallion, but does hot reflrift the number
y to one company, and he Hated that in many
battalions that company was not even form
* ed, that there were vacancies i'd all, and that
j supposing in some instances that not to he
' f the cafe, there was no impediment in the
law presenting the formation of new uniform
companies.
I| When he had mentioned that it appeared
.o be the intention of the fefiion under con- ,
fidera'ion to embody a certain class of citi- I
r zen s, such as merchants, lawyers, See. and 1
â  place them in the hands of the Prefirimt, his 1
colleague said ihe remark was insidious, and 1
that he (Mr. G.) mnlt kiow that thevolun :
teer corps in the militia are coinpofed chiefly |
of the ysomanry ofthj 'country. This he v
knew and this he wished to continue to be t
the cafe, but the objett of this feftion was 1
to create a change in that refpeft and to 1
nake the volunteers a separate and diftind c
body from the militia ; in (hort, that they [
should not be composed of men of all de *c rip - n
tions. And unl.*fs fnnje reason c.;uld be v
given why these volunteers would be more P
ufeful under this new organization, than as 11
militia, he wished them to be considered as \
the latter.
His colleague (Mr. Sitgreaves) had d
given two reasons why these men should ke G
considered as regulars rather than militia.â
The President, he observed, had no power r >
to call out any part of the militia for a longer ?'
term than three months ; whereas h: wouid p C
be authorized to call out these corps fÂ®r two c*
years. But if tnis was the only objedtioh, bt
it would be an easy matter to pass a law giv fu
ing the President tne power to call the militia n '
out for a longer period. But this was not a '
the only objeft of his colleague. He went tC
farther. He said there was an efTentiat dif- th
ferencebetwixt th?fe corps and the militia ; ril
tha* the law which authorizes a detachmen, C
of the militia, limits their service to iovafion re
infurredion, or imminent danger ; whilst re
the bill now before the committee is not so
limited, and this he gave as a reason why it e v
ought to be adopted. Now he would ask di
for what purpose these volunteer corps could fid
be employed, other than those above named ? dil
He should have been at a loss to have con- P e
jeÂ£tured, had be not heard an argument from lel
another gentleman from Massachusetts which je
feetned to lead to that object. After speak- cit
ing of the imminent danger of our situation, tin
and giving it all the colouring he was able, al1)
he went on to fay that England and Ireland, a "
who flood in a similar situation with u-, as be .
to the danger of an invasion from France, lud If
adopted the plan of raffing voluuteer corps fpt
upon a similar plan with these. And now, for
laid Mr. G. I woyiJ ask whether these men Â»? 1
are intended to'be raif'ed for pÂ»rpofes similar ,e[
to those for which volunteer corps have been w
raised in England and Ireland. He hoped i
not - f :
Another gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. cot
Dayton) had frtoken /till more piairiVy, jnd ral
told the committee, that, in addition to the
common service of troops, these volunteers
would be the firll ready not only to repel any
jS. invalion, but also to suppress seditious and
difaffefted persons, infiirgents, or any daring
infractors ot .the laws, Mr. G. asked, whe
thei it could be liippofed these Volunteers
lim w ould be better able to meet any of* these
ina â x? thanthe Militia (and the gentleman from
New Jcrfey argued as ifjhe thought so) and it'
10, whatwi)l make them better? The gentle
ew man himfelfhad proved that thfe Militia are
ier equal to the fubduingofinCurrettions, bymen
efe tioijing tjie Wertern InfurrccUon, which was
'j ie subdued by. the Militia ofN.ew Jersey, Pcnn
fylvania, Maryland and Virginia. Four years,
' Mr. G. laid, had elapsed since that insurrec
tion, and from that time, nothing; has been
HI- seen but a chearful, fumbiflion lo the laws,
lit, From that time, it is true, we have seen dif
ird ferences of political opinion j but no fym
(f. to 'Â» of any infraction of the laws.âOn the
n " contrary, we have seen nothing but an uni
versal attachment to the constitution, and a
â¢y sense of the happinef enjoyed under it. Why
Â»e then, is the house told, not only to day, but
on former tjccafions, of seditious. and difjif
at fedted perfonsâQl' dangers threatened to this
[le country, from insurreCtions f Of the dangers
. ftf an mvaliou he had already spoken, and
' would not repeat his observations on <hat
. head; bi;t gentlemen do not (lop here. They
:ia f P eak ' not ottfy of the danger or an invalion,
xt but ot the dangers of a Revolution, of an
re oversetting of the Government; and this is
e _ reprefeuted as more dangerous, and as likely
to be attended vvit.lj mpre difordcr than were
- the incurlions of t|io<?.Qths and Vandals of old.

at becaufeour veiTels continue to be captured in

â¢- order to suppress a supposed disaffection of
y the reft of the community. And feein-r that
w these motions rapidly succeed one anothT-r no
d one can tell how far it is intended to extend
d j ! hat . aiul whether we shall not soon
hear of fictitious conspiracies, pop-gun plots,
and every other party artifice which has been
practifed'n England. What, Mr. G. would
i- ask, had been the and what the con
â S faqwence of that fyflem in England > To
I, (frengthen the Executive at the expence of
e individual liberty, and to involve tile Coun
try in the mod fatal war, a war that has
' brought that country to the very brink of de
j ftruttion. Whether there existed in England,
e at that time, fnfficient reasons to have iu&ee[-
(i ted those measures, whether there wert in
r that country a number of persons difaffected
to their own Government, and desirous of pro
ducing there a revolution, he was not fuffici
- ently informed to be prepared either to af
firm or to deny. But certain he was, that
e whatever danger might have exilted there
s from France, or from internal difaffVtftion
t the measures adopted by that Government'
however well calculated to suppress for the
. moment, any dangerous fymptomj, had ulfi- '
mately terminated in creating real and imirii
â¢ nent danger from within and from abroad -
â  had brought Ireland to its present deplorable
I lituation, had provoked a perhaps fatal inva-
I (ion, and inlleadof preventing, had paved the
way tor a revolution.
But supposing there were reasons which
impelled the Bntilh Government to take the
meaiures which they did take, Mr. G. alkerf
wlnt cause there was for taking similar ones in
this country ? He knew of nothing which had
taken place here, since the We (tern Insurrec
tion (as he had already (aid) which couldindi
cate a necefiity for awe the people of
this country ; unless indeed it was the inten
tion of gentlemen to suppress Political Opi
nion. He saw symptoms on this floor , and in
various partsof the country, of adifference of
political opinion; but noneexiftsany whereas
to the propriety& necefiity ot repellinaanin
vading enemy, of'fupporting the Condmition
the Liberty and Independence of the coun
try; even amongst those who may have been
displeased with the former conduct of our
Government, in some of its foreign relations.
Gentlemen in this house, tMr. G. said, ve
ry often differed in opimon as to the propriety*
of laws and fettions of laws which palled the
legislature of the Union; but, when they are
paired, all were ofone opinion as totheir beinw
carried into effect. Vet it Ihould seem that
because persons differ in opinion on various
subjects, those who do not come up to the
flandard of the present majority of Congress
are to be considered as seditious and difaffec
ted persons. If this were not the cale, he
could not fee the use of the motion which has
this morning been laid upon the table, autho
ring the Committee for the protection of
Commerce and the Defence of the country, to
repert a bill to enable the President to secure,
remove, and otherwise redriet Aliens, ami
others, (the word Aliens might as well have
been omitted for the word oib-rs includes
every description whether citizens or aliens)
difaffected or seditious persons. This he con
sidered as a pari of the Alarm Syllem. Ho
did not believe that there were any seditious
persons within the United States, that could
renuer it necessary for Congress to exercise a
power forbidden by the conlfitution ; for he
denied that they had power to remove any
citizen out of tile United States ; nor was
there any necefiity for a military afiociation to
affiftthe Executive in the exercise of his leal
authority. Â°
be considered merely as providing, a force
againd any invasion which may be attempted
againfi this country, he would ask in what re
fpefts these volunteers would be better fitted
for that purpose than the Militia corps ? And
if there be no difference, he had already con
tended that there is no occalion for this law,
as Volunteers to any amount, might join the
Militia, according to the exlfling laws.
Ilis colleague (Mr. Sitgreaves) in reply to
fotnc obfervatioiis of his, has said, that th
qonfiderationof these volunteers being gene
rally men of properly, or who have expeCta-
\VOLUME XIII.tions of coming into the pofleffioifTJf"property,
will be the very reufon why they will prove a
sure defence of the country. Mr. G. (aid, Its
had as much confidence in men Â®f property as
others, but no more than he had in every free,
independent citizen. Whether a man bench
or poor, provided he has a common interest
in the welfare of the community, he had an
equal reliance upon him. And this is a confti
tutiunal idea ; tor th& constitution fays, 44 the
rights of the people to bear arms (hall not be J
questioned " Upon that ground, therefore, no
found argument could be drawn.
When his colleague frid, that no objection
could be brought against this corps on the
principle ot its being placed under the com
mand of the President, as the Militia is also
placed under his command, what does the re
mark amount to, but to fay that all the mili
tary force which can be railed, muftbe placed
under his command ? This he knew; but be
cause all the force to be raised, mule be placed
under his command, does it result that it may
not be dangerous toraifeand therefore to place
under his command, a force of a certain de
scription and unlimited as to its number ?
This feftion does not fay how the force is to
be employed, and his colleague makes this an
argument in its favour, because it is left
wholly at the disposal of the President of the
United States. And they are not only placed
at his disposal without any reftritton, but he
may accept of the service of as many as (hall
offer themselves. By this law, Congress give
up their right ot judging in every instance,
& leave to the President the sole power #f de
termining both the application and the num
ber of the army.
Mr. G. said his great obje&ion to this
armed force was, that it had the appearance
of arming one part of the people to guard
against the other ; and this was evident from
the arguments of gentlemen themselves, when
they (peak of this force being wanted for the
fame purpose, for which a similar force has
been resorted to in England and Ireland. In
short, if we consider the present state of this
country, and that in cafe of attack, nothing
can be so desirable as unanimity, he did not
think it would be prudent to have this half
way corps betwixt regulars and militia, which
would disgust the militia, and which in his
opinion would rather have a tendeney to di
vide and disunite the country, than to provide
for its defence in cafe of real danger.
Mr. Hartley said, the gentleman laftup,
in speaking of the troops which subdued the
iniurrettion ill this (late, represented them as
being wholly drafted from the militia. Ht;
mtift recoiled that one of the most refpefta
ble corps employed on that occasion was a
volunteer corps of this city.

SI R,
WHILE we disapprove an interference
of the people with the admisiftration of oar
national government, we consider it our du
ty at this time to aflure you, that the mea
sures you have adopted and pursued, as firft
Magillrate of the union, have universally met
our hearty concurrence ; in full confidence
that those measures have been di&ated by
wisdom and the pure It principles of patno
tifm, we cannot withold the grateful ex
preflion of our thanks for your undeviating
firmuefs in their execution.
Your late exertions to redress our wrongs,
to accommodate differences unhappily > x
illing between this country and the French
Republic, to conciliate the affeftion of pur
all es, to preserve our neutrality, to eftablifli
our peace and happinels, and above all to
support the independence, dignity and free
dom of the United States, afford the highest
evidence of the justice and wisdom of your
adminiflration, and demand, in an eminent
degree, the gratitude of every patriotic
American.
We humbly deprecate the calamities of
war ; but when the fafety, the indepen -
dence, the freedom of our country require
it, we submit to the direftion of the go
vernment of our choice. Imploring the
blefljng of Heaven, we are prepared, with
our property and at the hazard of our lives,
to support our government, to vindicate our
rights, and to defend our country.
To the Inhabitants of the Town of Haverhill,
in the State of Majfachufetts.
GENTLEMEN,
I THANK you for a refpe&ful and
affectionate address, which has been pre
sented to me by Mr. Bartlett, your Repre
sentative in Congress.
The inters rence of the people with the
administration of the national government,
in ordinary cases, would be not only useless
and unnecessary, but very inconvenient and
cxpenfive to them, if not calculated to dis
turb the public councils with prejudices,
paflions, local views, and partial
which would better be at reft ; but there
are some great conjun&ures, in which it is !
proper, and, in such a government as ours, j
perhaps neceflary. If ever such anoccafion |
can occur, the present is one.
Your aflurance to me that the measures I
have adopted, as ficft Magistrate of the uni
on, have uniformly met your , hearty ap
probation ; and your declaration that you
are prepared, with your property and at .
the hazard of your lives, to support your
government, vindicate your rights, and de
fend your country, are to me a great con
solation.

Ex trad ofa letter from a gentleman oj good information in
Europe, dated Feb. 17,1798.
u There is no doubt that the French are indefafiga
bly working to raise an infurrc&ion at Hamburgh, a
gainft^heprefent government. Among the means
they are using for the purpose, I (hall particularly no
tice at present, only the eftablifhraent of zTAto-phi
lanthropic Sociaty.
It is a theological and political mixture of deism,
morality, antt-chrifttanity and revolution, that the
do&rine preaches. It is under the special encourage
ment and protection of the French direftory. La
reveillere Lepaux is one of its founders. He is a
profefled and bitter enemy of Christianity, againil
which he has read a long and tedious diflertation, to
the national institute.
â¢â¢The Paris prints have latelyafferted that Dupont ;
De Nemours is going to America, with the intention of
fettingupaTheo.philanthropic Society. He has been
to the society at Paris to request of them a copy of
that which contains their do&rines and constitution
Dupont de Nemours was one of the unfortunate
membcrsof the legiflÂ«tive aflcmbly, upon whom the
Fru&idor revolution fell.- He was not like the others
condemned to transportation or even expelled he was
permitted to his feat, and by yielding to tne
torrent, escaped its dellruftive fury. He is the man,
who, while a member of the legifli'uie, was so anx
ious to have France pursue a I)ftem of conciliation to
ward the Americans,- so as to induce them to chufe
for theirPrefident, a man devoted to France.
â¢' If Dupont is going to America, w th the deGgn
mentioned, he has made his peace with the dire&ory
and wil. be a diligent servant to them on your fide of
the Atlantic."
LONDON, April 13.

Uni t'dStates, stb June, 1798*
Dear Sir, Paris, March 9th, 1798. '
Agreeably to what we reprefeuted to you in our '
No. 6, we prepared a letter to the Miniiter of Fo- 1
reign A {fairs, on the fubje& of the lute law au
thorizing the capture of neutral vefTeis, on board 1
of which any produ&ions of Great Britain, or its
poflefiinns, should be laden, (hewing how incom- 1
patible such law was with the rights of neutral
nations, and the treaty between France and y\me-- 1
rica, its dire& tendency to de j-oy the remaining
commerce of our country, and the particular hard-
Ibipsto which it would; fubje<sl the agricultural as ;
V/elf as'fcimmercial of our countrymen,
from' the peculiar fitttatjqn.of the United States. NVe
I added,'that under emitting .ciicumftances, we could '
' no longer resist the convudion that the derr.ands'.of
FrancV rendered it entirely impraCUaable to effe'dl '
the objeds of our million, and that not being per
manent min'fters, ; but Enyoys Extraordinary witli
fullpower for we deemed it ifti-'
proper-to remain longer jn France after the'ifrtpoPi
bility ofefftAingtfeofe.purpofes had bean'dertonflrii
| ted. Before however, we took this measure and ex-*
-pHcitly demanded our passports. We. deemed it ex
-pedient to desire major Rutledge to call oh *mr. *
Talleyrand, on the 19th ult. to know if he had any
1 cowo*unication to make 10 us in consequence of our
j, letter dated ;the 17th and delivered the 31ft of Jan.
To this mr. Tally rand replied, that he had no an
swer to make, as the directory h d not taken takeu
any order 011 the fubjaft, and when they did, he
would inform us of it Still being anxious to hear
explicitly from mr, Tallyrand himfelf before lent
our final letter, whether there were no means with
in our power, of -accommodating our differences
wlth : France on just and reason able grounds, we'
wrote to him on the 2.7 th of fdlidftmg
a personal iuterview on the fubjed of our million ;
he appointed the ad of March following. You
will find in the exhibit a, herewith inolofed, what
passed on that occaflon.. On. the 4th
rsquefted another interview : Wa have detailed in ,
the latter part of |he samÂ« exhibit, for your infor
mation, the substance of that conversation.
From these accounts you may obfcrve, that the
views of France, with regard to-us, are not essen
tially changed since oar communications with its
unofficial agents in prober last.

Col. Pickering, Sec. United States.
A.
March the second. At three o'clock we ;
waited 011 Mr. Talleyrand, and were aimoft
immediately introduced to him.
Pinckney commenced "the conversation, by
faying, that our government, and ourselves j
were extremely anxious to remove the ftib- I
lifting difference between the two republics \ !
that we hadreceived many propositions, thro* |
Mr- Y. to whigh w.e.had it impVactic?a- ;
ble to accede ; and that we had now warted
on him for the purpose of enquiring whether,
other means might not be deviled which .
would effect so defirabl*object'. Tjie
.rninifter replied, that without doubt, the.-Di
rectory wished vefy fincerelyV on onr arrival,
io fee a solid friendfhip eflablifhed between
France and the United States, and, had marti- -
fefted this dilpoTition, ty tjis readmd's witli
which orders for our passport were given.
That the Diredtoty had bee7l exrremely
wounded by the last speech of .General W'afh
ingtpn, made to Ccngrefs when about to"qiiit
rhe office of President of the United States ;
and by the firft and last speech of Mr. Adams.
That explanations of vhefe speeches were ex
pected and required ofiiS. General Pinckney
expressed his surprize that the speech of Ge
neral Waftiington was complained of ; and
laid this was a new complaint. Mr. Tal
leyrand merely observed, thai: the Directory
was wounded at it; and proceeded. He said
that the original favorable disposition of the
Directory had been a good deal altered by the
coldness anddiftance which we had observed.
That instead of feeing him often, and endea
vouring to remove the obstacles to a mutual
approach, we had not once waited or. him.
General Pinckney observed, that when we
delivered him oilr letters of credence, he in
formed us that the DireCtcry, in a few days,
would decide concerning us, and that when
the decision was made he would communicate
It to us. That this had for some time fuf
peMed any proceedurc on our pirt. He an
iwered that this related only to our public
character, and not to private visits. General
Pinckney said, that on an application made
by hisfecretary fora passport for an American
his care, he was told that he mult ap
ply to the office of police, for that America
had no minifler in France, since the recall of
Mr. Monroe. Th> minister said that was ve
ry true ; and then proceeded to fay, that the
Directory felt itfelf wounded by the different
fpeech&s ot Mr. Washington and Mr. Adams,
which he had stated, and would require some
proof, on the part of the United States, of a
friendly disposition, previous to a treaty with
us. He then said thatfhe ought tofcarch for
and propose some means which might furnifh
this proof ; that if we were disposed to fur
nifh it there could be no difficulty % in finding
it ; and he alluded very intelligibly to a loan.
He said he had several conferences with Mr.
Gerry on this lubjeft, who had always an-'
fwered that we had no power. Mr. Gerry
said that he had slated other objections; that
he had particularly urged that it wtfuld in
volve us in a war with Great Britain. He
made no reply ; and Gen. Pinckney observ
ed, that a loan had been suggested to us j but
| that we had utH'lomily atifwered, that it ex- ~
ceeded our powers. j (
Mr. Talleyrand replied, that persons at , (
i such a distance as we were from eur govern- ! f
men', and poflefled as we were of the public â 
confidence, mult often use their discretion,
and exceed their powers, for ihe.jgublic good. '
That thereTJas a rlidtirfal difference between 1
afting where inltruCtioiis were silent, and do- 1
ing wtut was particularly Forbidden, that if i
indeed a loan was pofitivelv forbidden, we <
might conlider ourselves as incapable of male- -
ing one j but if, as he supposed was the cafe |
(he looked the question) our inftrnCtions were
only lilenf, that it must be referred to us to
ait in a cafe not provided for, according to 1
the bell of ourjudgment, for the public gobd : â '
that in almoi,.ill the treaties made duri.ng.tht â 
revolution, the negociators had exceeded I i
their powers; although the government ap
pointing them wasat no conliderable distance. j j
He particularized the treaty with Pruflia, and | (
several others. General Pinckney told him
that oup powers did not extend toaioan, and I
perhaps might forbid it. The Minister (till j
urged the difference between an express pro- j
hibition, and mere silence. He then proceed- ! 1
ed to (tate that the principal objection on the i 1
part of our Government to a loan must be, I ]
that it would draw us nut of the neutral litua- 1 ,
tion in which we wiflied to continue : that ,
there were various means of evading tins j ,
firlt, the secrecy of France, which might be ,
relied on ; and fecondlv, means of disguising '
the loan might bedeviled, which would ef- j
feCtually prevent its being considered as an '
aid during the present war : that if we were '
truly and fincerdy delirous of effecting the '
thing, we Ihould experience no difficulty in <
finding the means. Ae again Hated t> propo- ,
fition of this fort, on our part as being abfo
-lutely necedary to prove that tlie government
was not about entering into a treaty with per
-fons of a temper hostile to it. MV. Gerry not 1
well hearing mr. Talleyrand, who fpokelow,
asked him to explain himfelf with respeCt to :
the proposition which he had alluded to, flip- '
-paling it to be a new one : and lie answered, ,
that one of them was secrecy; but that there ; ,
were besides various ways which might easily |
be suggested to cover the loan as an imniedi- !,
-ate one, by.limiting the lime of advancing it | .
todiftant inftalmcnts Mr. Gerry observed, \ '
that Dutrimond had fuggellcd that a loan was j
propof.d to be made payable after the war,
and irvfupplies ts St. Domingo. Mr. Tal
leyrand fignified, that that might be one of
the mjans tifed ; and said that it we were on
:iy sincere in our wiffi, it would bÂ« cafy to
bring ab ont th e e nd.
(general Marshall told Mr. Talleyrand,
that if tlie;Mimfters of the United States
liad manifefted.any tmwillingnefs to take
aU'proper v HiQans to reconcile the two re
â¢publitA, or any indifference on the sub-
they had very badly represented the
Teeii.ngs and wishes of their government;
that the government of the United
States, was most tincerely delirous of pre
serving the friendfliipof France,"andhad,
in his opinion, unequivocally manifefted
that delire', by having deputed us under
the cxeraordinary circumstances attend
ing bur milTion, atjd ,h,y having so long
patiently borne .the immenfc lofsof pro
perty which had been sustained ; that We
had endeavoured,- according to the belt of
our judgment, to represent truly the dif
jfofition of our government ; but tnat we
undef-ftood that Frdnce would consider
nothing as an evjdfnce.of ;Â£riendÂ£hip, but
ap aft which, would tranfeend and- - vj<slate' '
out'powers, and at the fame time operate ;
the mod feviouS injury to.our country ;
that neutrality J inthe present War, was of
the last importance to the United States ;
and. they had resolved faithfully to main--
tain it-; that they had committed no aft,
Voluntarily, which was abrca<;h ofit; and
could do nothing jjj fecretj which, if
known, would just', v-ai range them among
the belligerent powers ; that in the pre
sent state of thjngs, if America was aftu
< ally leagued. wijh-Fra-nce in the war, she
I would only be required to furnijh mp--
I TlÃy that we had neither war or
j men to be employed in it â  and could corr
| ftquently, as a belligerent power, only be
| asked for money ; that therefore, to fur-,
j nifh money, was, in -faft;" to'mafce War ; .
j which we could by no'ttiearrs cbnf.ent to
I do ; and which -Would abfol.utely trah
! Icend our powers ; being an aft altogether.
wirhoiit the view and contemplation of
our government when our million' was
depided on : that with refpeft to supplies
to Saint Domingo, no doubt coulti be en
. tertained. that our merchants would fur
nifh them_ very abundantly, if Frairce
would permit the commerce ; and a loan
really payable after the Close of the war,
might then be" negociated. Mr. Talley
rand again marked the diffcirielion be
tween silence of inftruftions and an ex
press prohibition ; and again infilled on
the neceflity of our proving, by some
means which we mud offer, our friend
fhip for the republic. He said he must
exaft from us, on the part of his govern
ment, some proposition of this Wrt ; that
to prove our friendfhip, there must be
some immediate aid, or lomething which
might avail them ; that the principles of
reciprocity would require it. Gen. Pinck
ney and Gen. Marshall underflood him, by
this expression, to allude to the loan for
merly made by France to the U. States.
Mr. Gerry, at the time, thought he al
luded to the treaty U> be made, and said
all treaties should be founded in reci
procity, and then asked him whether a
loan was the ultimatum of this govern
ment. Mr. Talleyrand did not give a
direst aniwer to the question : he said,
as he was underflood, that the govern
ment insisted on some aÂ£t which would
demonflrate our friendly dilpofition to
wards, and our good wishes for the Re
public : this once done, he said, thead
juftment of complaints would be easy;
that would be matter of enquiry, and if
France had done uj wrong, it would be
repaired. But that if this was refufed,
, j it would increale the diftancc and cold
i ness between the two Republics. The
conversation continued in this style un
i til four o'clock, when we took our leave,
and agreed to meet. in the evening. In
' the courle of it, and in reply io some
observations of Mr, Talleyrand, refpeft
ing the proofs of friendfhip required by
! France, General Pinckney observed.
t that our being hercâwas a mark of the
- friendly dilpofition of our government;
c j and that while-we were here, the govern
â¢ I ment had parted a decree for seizing- neu
t ' tral veffcls having on board any article
coming out of England, which in its '
operation* Would iubjeit to capture ail 1
our property on the ocean. Mr.Til lev-
rand replied, that this was not particular (
to us, but was common to all the neti- j
tral power;. \t another timcy-m anl- ,
wer to his demand of some ran!, if our
friendfhip. General Marshall observed, t
that we considered the mutual interests t
of the two nations as requiring peace '
and friendfhip ; and we relied on finding '
fufficient motives inthc intereflof France '
â¢topreferrethat friendfhip,withoutforcing j
us loan aft, which tranfeeudedourpowers c
and would befo injurious to pur country. (
As we were tan ing our leave, Mr. Talley- (
rand again noticed our not visiting him, i
and said, that he conceived onr not hay- I
ing had an audience from the Direftory '
ought not to have prevented it. General '
Marshall told him, that our feeing the .
Djreftory, or not, was an objeft of no |
fort of ctSicern to us ; that we were | ,
perfeftly indifferent with regard to it; I
but that we conceived* that until our j
public character was in some degree re- ;
cognized, and we were treated as the mi- j
niflers and retire fen tat iV es of our go- !
vernmcnt, we could not take upon our- j
selves to act as mini flers, because by do
ing so, we might subject durlelves to
some injurious circumflances to which
we could not submit. He said that was
very true; but we m'ight fee him as pri
vate individuals,'and discuss the objects
of difference between us.
We requested of Mr. Talleyrand ano- 1
ther interview, at such hour as might be
convenient to him, on the sixth instant.
He answered, that he would receive us
at half pall eleven ; at which hour we
attended him.
Immediately after our arrival at his
office-, we were introduced to the Mi
nifler, and General Pinckney stated, that
we had considered, with the mo ft serious
attention, the conversation we had had the
honor of holding with him, a few days
past: that the proportions he had sug
gested, appeared to us to be fubflantially
the fame with thole which had beers made
by Mr. X, by Mr. Y, and also to Mr. Gerry,
with an intention that they fliould be commu
nicated to his colleagues ; that we consider
ed it as a proposition, that the 0. States should
! furniill aid to France, to be used during the
present war: that tho' it was unusual to dis
close infractions, yet we would declare to
that in addition to its being a liieafui'e
amounting to a declaration of war againfl
Great Britain,we were expressly forbidden by
our intfruition to take such a step.
The minifler said, in the tone of question,
he supposed our inflrudtions were to do no
thing which would amount to a departure
from our neutrality.âGeneral Pinckney said,
that we were so inftrufted ; and that they
were Hill more particular. Mr. Talleyrand
then proceeded to argue, that it would be |io
departure from neutrality, toflipulate a loan
payable after the war : and spoke of it clearly
as admitting of application to immediate use.
He said a good deal of the secrecy with which
the tranfactioa might be cloathed ; and obser
ved further,, that a loan payable after the war,
would lie a proof of our faithful observance
of the duties of neutrality ; since it would be
JSPnfidered as proving that' we had rejected
;propofitions {6r an immediate loan. General
Marshall replied, that we thought differently ;
that in our opinion, any aft on the part of the
American Government, on which one of the
belligerent powers could raise money for im
mediate afe, would be funiifliing aid to that
power, and would be taking part in the war.
It Would"! be, in to take the only part
which, in the exifling slate of things America
could take. This was our deliberate opinion,
and in addition to it, we considered our in
(lructionS is csucluftve-on thispoint.
He observed, that we had claims on the
French Government, for property taken from
American citizens. Some of those claims
were probably jufl. He alked,,if they were
acknowledged by France, whether we could
not "give a credit as to the payment, fay tor
tvvo years We answered that we coiild. He
then infirtetj that it was precisely the fame
'thing, that by such an ait we should consent
to leave inthe hands of Trance, funds to u Inch
'our citizens-wer; entitled, and which might
be nfed in the profceuiion of the war. Gen.
Puiikney said tliere was a difference between
the cases; that such prizes were now actually
in the power of the French, without our con
sent, we could not prevent it, or get them
our; but the granting or not granting a loan
was in our power. He repeated his observati
on, and GeneraJ Mardiall said that the pro
perty for which money was due to American
citizens from the French Government, was
taken into the pofTcllion of that government
without any co-operation on the part of the
United States.
No aft of any fort was performed by our
Government, which in any degree contribut
ed to place those funds in the hands of France,
nor was there any consent tow ards it ; but in i
the cafe proposed, the aft would be the aft
of the Government; the Government could
itfelf place funds in the hands of France ; and
thereby furnifh means which might be em
ployed in the prolecution of the war. This
waithe difliniStion between the cases, and in
a queltion of neutrality, it appeared to us to
be all important. The Miniller then pro
ceeded to ftaje the cafe of our alfuming the
debt of our citizens, and of paying the money
in that manner : but General Pinckney arid
Mr. Gerry told hi in we were positively forbid
den to assume the debt to our. oy.'n citizens,
even if we were to pay the money direilly to
them. He seemed surprized at th's. Gene-
obferved, that contrary to ulage,
we had deemed it proper, in the exiting slate
of things, to state candidly our powers to
him, that he might know certainly that we
could not secretly, or under any difguifeh wat
! ever, make a loan which might be used dur
j ing the war.
Mr. Talleyrand said he must resume his po-
I fition, that there was a difference, which lie
i must insist upon, between a loan payable im
â¢ : mediately, and a loan payable in future ; and
\ he (till infilled there was no difference between
i a loan payable in future and a credit for the
J money which might be due to our citizens.â
â  Mr. Gerry observed that his colleagues had
: jufUy stated the distinction between the debt
which will be due to the citizens of the Uuit
ed States from France, in cafe of her recog
nizing the claims which we shall make in their
behalf, and a debt which might arise from a
loan by the Government of the United States
to that of France, during the war. The one
is the result of an arrelt of their property with
out their consent, the other would be a vo
luntary aft of the Government of the United
i States, and a breach of their neutrality.â
â  There is an additional objection to the latter ;
â  if the United States should make such a loan,
; it would give too much reason to suppose that
their Government had cctifented, "in a c 6'â¢,-'
five maiin.'r, to the capture of ihe-vellels .if
their citizens, and had tluis U-eu turn
France \Vi'tli frtppfies to carry on the war. â 
Our 1 fnftruftions are exprel'St not '<> llipulaff
for tiny aids to France, either directly or iuji -
reflly, during the war.
With relpecl to a secret flipulation, a loutl
cinnot be 'made without an act of the â¦egifla
ture : but if the executive were adequate til
it, we have had an rnllance btaninjunction of
secrecy on members of the Senate, on an iui
portant fubjeel, which one of the
thought himfelt warranted *ll publishing iii
the news-papers ; and of frequent infantes
ot fee rets which have otherwile efcaped't se
crecy, in this infance,' might therefore be
considered, if the measure was in itfelfadtijifs
ible, as being impracticable. General Mar-*
(hall oblerved, that we had considered the
subjeCt with great solicitude, and were decid
edly of opinion, fhat we could nor, under any
form, make a loan which Could be used dur
ing the war ; that we could no't tell what out 1
government would do, if on the spot ; but
were perfectly clear, that without additional
orders, we could not do what France requeu
ed. Mr. Gerry observed, that the govern
ment and nation of the U uited States, as well
as ourselves, were earnestly folicitbus to re
flore triendfllip between the two republics;
that, as Gen. Marshall had dated, we could
not fay what our government would do, if on
the spot; but if this proposition met the willi
es of the government of France, General
Marshall and himfelf bad-agreed immediately
to embark for the United States, and lay be
tore our government the exifling fate of
things here, as it relpeiled our nation, to en
able them todeterminewhelherany, and what!
other measures on their part were neceliary.
Mr. Talleyrand made no observation on this
proposition : but enquired whether we ex
pected soon to receive orders. Mr. "Gerry
mentioned an answer lie had received tea let
ter sent by him in November; aiid General
Marshall fated, that pur firft dif'patches were
sent on board two vessels at AmfteTdam, oil
the twentieth of November ; from which
Mr. 1 alleyrand could form as ju(t an idea as
we could, when an answer might be expect
ed : but he did not think it probable one
would arrive befuri a month to come. Ge
neral Marshall told hint, we knew that. >ntr
'government had liot reqeived our d-fpa'tches
on the eighth ot January ; and we could not
tell when tfiey might be received. rie afkfd
whetheroitrintelligence came through Eng
land. Gefferal Marshall answered that it did
not; and General Pinckney said, that Ame
rican papers as late a-s the eighth of January
mentioned the fait.
There was some ConVersation about the
time when tliefe inflructions might be expec
ted ; and General Marshall fuggefled a doubt
whether our Government might give any in
flruifions. He asked, with some surprise,
whether we had not written for inflructions f
And we answered, that we had not t and Mr.
Gerry said that we had fated fails to our go
vernment, and conceived that nothing more
was neceflaiy. General Pinckney obierved,
that the Government knowing the fails,
would do what was proper ; and that our ap
plying or not applying for inftruftions wonld
not alter their conduil. Mr. Talleyrand then
enquired whether we had not sent any one to
the United Ststes. General Pinckney said
no : and Mr. Gerry added, that soon after
our arrival we had made propositions to fend
one of our nnmber, which were not accepted.
And General Marshall further added, rhat
those who had communicated with us, had
told 11s we should be ordered out of France
immediately ; and we had supposed that we
should be ordered ofutbefore our letters could
reach the government. Mr. Gerry then ob
served, that the Government of France mult
judge for itfelf ; but that it appeared to him,
that a treaty on liberal principles, such as those
on which the treaty of commerce between the
two nations was firft edablilhed, would be in
finitely more advantageous to France than the
trifling advantages file could derive from a,
loan. Such a treaty would produce a friend
fhipand attachment, on the part of the Uni
ted States to France, which would he solid
and permanent, and produce benefits farm-,
periorto those of a loan, if we bad powers to
make it. To this observation Mr. Talley
rand made no reply. Weiarted without any
sentiment delivered by the miniflsr on the
f'ubject of our going home to consult our go -
vernment.
As we were taking our leave of, Mr. Tal
leyrand, we told him that two of its would
return immediately, to receive the' inHruili*
ons of our government, if that would be a
grecable to the Directory : if it was not, we
would wait some tinie, in the expectation of
receiving iafl ruCtions.

NOTICE.
HAVING observed an advertifemert of C. 1
Gullagcr, in terms derogatory of our pro- 1
sessional abilities, we have to request the public f
not to be imposed upon by foreign artists ; but to t
decide upon the merits of each by a comparifon.ot c
the work executed by both, as it is a niode almost
universally adopted by them to invalidate the ta
lents ef ertablilhed artists, with a view of deceiv
ing the public, and engrofling that business which
their profeflional knowledge in no wife entitles -
them to. Well knowing that public opinion must
govern, we flatter ourselves that the work execut
ed by us will convince them of our great superio
rity over Mr. Gullager iu every Uranch of por
trait and ornamental painting, and {hew the nectf- r
fity of judging for themselves.
N. B. In future no attentian will be paid to thi a
