On Monday, the committee from both
branches, waited on his Excellency the Gov
ernor, informing that a quorum of each was
present, and ready to receive his communi
cations. He assigned Tuesday at 12 o'clock
to meet the two Houi'es in the Representatives
Chamber.
Agreeably to appointment, on Tuesday at
12 o'clock, his Excellency, attended by the
Council, came in, ahd addrell'ed tiu- Senate
and House of lieprsfentatives in the following
SPEECH.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives
SELECI ED by the citizens of the State,
and afiembled at this time agreeably to your
own determination, for the important pur
pose of promoting the general welfare ; it
must afford great fatisfattlon, that our fyl
tems both of State and National Government
are so well adapted to this desirable end.
To redress public grievances, if any such
there are, and to make laws calculated to ie
cure the bleifings of liberty and advance the
happiness of the people, must be a pleailng
employment.
The great degree of harmony and tran
quility, so apparent as it refpefts the internal
concerns of the State, must be highly grati
fying ; and if the welfare of the people re
quires an amendment to any of the laws now
in force, or that new laws (hould be made,
these circumftanccs riiuft be known to their
representatives.
United with other States by a Federal
compatt, for Certain purposes, our interests
are inseparably connected with that govern
ment, which is endeared to us by the highly
beneficial effects it has produced.
When we lee a foreign nation overturn- '
ing ancient systems of government, without !
any regard to their form : extending robbe- i
ry anddevaftation as far as their forces can j
reach ; when we fee them contemning all
moral and religious obligations ; despising
national compa&s j plundering our citizens
while in pursuit of lawful commerce ; in
sulting our government, and threatening us
with the fate of nations it has degraded and
destroyed ! At iuchatime as this, we fliould
highly prize the bleifings of good govern
ment, and determine with one voice and
mind, to support and defend our rights and
piivileges, against all hostile attempts what
ever.
Much of the bl6od and treasure of the
United States ot America, has been
themlelves is such manner as they fliould 1
chooft4âthis great okjÂ»<ft being gained, our
Tyftem of general government has been form
ed in as free a manner, and under circumftan- :
ces as favorable, perhaps more so, thaa ;
that of any government which ever existed
over such an extensive territoryâlt is such a 1
fyft&m as the people have chosenâmay be ]
altered when it lhall be found necessaryâthe 1
persons appointed to administer it, return to :
the class of citizens at short intervals, and
others are fele&ed in their places. What <
more can be desired ? If this is destroyed, ]
where (hall we look for a free government ? 4
While tlie French nation was apparently 1
pursuing meafuj-es for the promotion of lib- 1
erty, they had the good wiflaes at least, of a '
large proportion of the citizens of the Uni
ted States ; but, unfortunately for our coun- c
try, they have had much encouragement t
from the conduit of many citizens, when it c
leemed alraoft impossible that any one (hould
entertain an idea that the freedom of man !
was their objeÂ£tâafter they* had prostrated a
governments, once free, and tyrannized over c
the citizensâand after it had become appa- c
rent, that universal domination was their ob-
The conduft of those who rule over

aided by the conduit of some of our own
citizens, our Government has been traduced ;
attempts have been made, and in some instan
ces succeeded, in exciting unreasonable iea- '
louues among the people, persuading them
that they have a separate interest from thole
whom they have eledted to administer the
Governmentâno service*, however wife, 0

ment, to adopt every neceflary measure to
maintain and defend our dear-bought rights
and privileges: And that we and our Condi
tuents are ready to rally round the ftandaid
of our Government, and defend it at the ex
pence of our blood and treasure, against tl e
machinations and violence of a foreign power
aspiring to universal domination.
We lament, that so many instances have
occurred in this countiy, in whiqh periodical
publications have been the vehicles cf /lan
der and calumny against the guardians of its
rights ; and that any American should fce
so degenerate as to abuse and vilify an
" Adams, or a Washington."
A law for establishing a new proportion
of public taxesâand the exiting state of
the 1 reafuryâare objects worthy of our
confide ration.
The resolutions of the Legi/lature of
Maflachuletta and Connecticut, are of such
an important nature, and come from faur
ces so refpe&able, as to merit, and shall re
ceive, our candid attention.
i ANSWER,
Of the Senate of New Hampjhire, to tht
Governor's Speech.
[Prefcnttd on lift.]
May it pltafe y*ur Excellency,
THE Senate of the state of New-Hamp-
Jhire, with particular pleasure meet your
Addrcfs at the opening of the present felfi
on of the Legillature.
Afftmbled for the pnrpofe of consulting
the common good of our constituents, we
contemplate with fatijfaftion the advantag
es we enjoy under a free government, to ren
der a people happy ; the effedU of which are
so apparent in our present internal tranqui
lity ami union.
While we view thc nation of France, un
der the falfe pretext of eftablifliing liberty
amongst thcmfelves and other natiei s of the
earth, tyrannizing over thc vidims Â«f their
ambi ion ; unprovokedly and indiscrimi
nately dcfolating cities, and overturning
governmentsâwe cannot but prize the bltf
lings of our own, and refolre, at every ha
zard, to d< fend it.
The Constitution of our general govern
ment secures to us every privilege which a
rational mind can desire, and is the admira
tion of the wisest politicians
The intercourse of kind offices between
thc French nation and America, and the
mutual services rendered each other, for ma
-1 y rears, had united them to us in bonds of
amity which no inconsiderable cause has
broken, and wWe the liberty and happiness
of man appearrd to us their only <.bje<fl, our
good wilhes attended them in evety pursuit :
But avarice and power, gaining afceirdency
over honesty and rcafuii, hurried them on
to such wild extravagancies as astonished the
mod friendly nations, and incurred our jufl
refeutment.
When w? turn our attention to the longcontinued deprcd -.nous on our commerce,
the repeated infulti to our general govern- !
ment in the rejection of our envoys, anil the I
inlijious measures pursued to divide and
diflraft our councils, every tender feeling is
ex inguifhedâBut what better can we ex
peft from a nation divelled of piety and e
vtry moral sense, and whufe Creed is Athe
tftti ' âWith such, friendfhip cannot be
maintained, and solemn treaties are as idle
tales.
It is to be lamented, that any American
citizen wuul i take a part on the fide of our
enemies, to calumniate our favorite Rulers
and weaken the arm of government. \v e
lament also, the abuse of that fundamental
privilege in our conliituiion, the liberty of the
Press: But calumny, when ifluing from
some particulai periodical fountains, and
aimed at " a WASHINGTON, or an
ADAMS," is praiie : For such illustrious
charaders need only be named, to be admir
ed ; w ofe wife and patriotic exertions,
from the commencement of our revolution,
to the present day, have uniformly tende - '.
to obtain and prcferve our Lioert) and la
dtpei dence
The measures pursued by the Executive
of our General Governmeii:, in appointing
and inltruftin? Envoys with a view t'> oper
ate â  reconciliation between thefÂ« United
States and the French Republic, are evi
dences to us of f.iperior wisdom, and an ar
dent desire for peace ; and the effeft of their
negociatiou convincing, that further at
tempts would prove frilitltfs. Nothing
therefore remains but to place oarfelves in
a proper fitoation of defence, having no al
ternative but the ultimate argument of in
jured republics : but in any event, ulyi'ig
on the wisdom of our conllituted authori- <
tie* to dilate, we (hall ever Hand ready to I
co operate with them for the general fafety. <
Ihe important and interelling fubjedts
contained in the communications from our i
neighboring Hates, together with those t
which more immediately concern this, will ]
meet our early and due attention ; confident e
of yout Excellency's readiness to unite with e
us, in every measure conducive to the wel- i
fare of our common country.

â rt 1 herefore Logan, and his employers, can be on W
,a- looked upon in no other light, than as trai- j
tors. It was not for the benefit of America ~

a- Â«'hat plan to puifue, in order to accomplilh Hay

Logan and his empi.oykrs, would pav the

e, Any compromile with the present rulers

n. horror, much less, such an one as they would
be willing to make. A writer in this paper a
