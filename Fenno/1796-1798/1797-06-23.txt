Wednesday, Juneiii . '
Mr. F1 kxsl E Y obtained leave of absence I
for the feiiiaindcr of the fcflicni c
The SpeaREA having informed thehoufe T
that the unfinifhed business of yefterdav, vie. t
the bill prohibiting citizens of the U. States
from entering into the military or naval fer-
Vic< of any fofeigit priilce or state, had the 1
priority- 1
Mr. (Jailal'lk moved to have itpo(lponÂ» <
ed, in order to take up the bill refpedtmg an 1
additional naval armament. This motion was '
supported by Mr. Giles and opposed by Mr.
\V. Smith, and negatived 35 to 34.
The bill refpedting foreign service was
taken up, aud, on motion of Mr. Havens,
It was agreed to leave the time of its taking
place a blank.
Mr. Colt moved to strike out the sixth
lection, which was in the following words:
" And whereas for the due execution of
this and other laws tending to- the security
of the public welfare, it is expedient to de
fine ana ascertain the mode in which a citi
zen may diflolve the the ties of citizen
ship, and become an alien; be it further en
aÂ£led,
That the citizen 1 of the United States,
whether native or adopted, shall be deemed
citizens thereof, until they relinquiih that
character in manner hereinafter provided,
that is to fay ; whensoever any citizen of
the United States shall, by deed in writing,
under his haud and seal, executed in the
presence of, and fubferibed by two or more
witnesses, and at leafl by two of the sub
scribing witneflei proved before the supreme,
superior, diflrift or circuit court of some one
of the States, or of the Territories north
wefl of the river Ohio, or before a circuit
or diftrift eourTof the United States, with
in Ae jurifdidtion of which court he shall
then be resident, or by open verbal declara- !
tion, made and recorded in either of the
courts aforefaid, declare that he abfolatfcly
and entirely renounces all allegiance and fi
delity to the United States, and to every of
them, and (hall forthwith depart out of the '
territorial limit's thereof; every such person,
from the time of his departure, if 'his re
nunciation, verbal or written as aforefaid,â
shall have been duly recorded beforr his de
parture, (hall be considered expatriated, and
for ever thereafter shall be deemed an alien,
in like manner and to all intents as if he had
never been a citizen : Provided always that
he shall not enter into the military or naval
service of a foreign nation, or become the :
owner or p&rt owner of any foreign priva- '
teer or letter of marque, within one year of
his departure from the said United States ;
and if any such person shall enter the mili
tary or naval service of a foreign nation, or
become the owner or part owner of any fo
reign privataer or letter of marque, within
the space of one year from the time of his
departure from the United States, he shall
be liable to all the pains and penalties to
which he would have been fubjeft for the
like condudt if he had continued-a citizen."
Mr. StwALL hoped it would- bettruefc
out. In every country in the world where
civil feciety was established, th<; citizens of
that society owed a certain duty 'to'their
government which he could rot readily get
clear of; but they were about to establish a
principle to put it in the power of the citi
zens of the United States at their will,"and
without any pretence, to fay they would be
no longer fubjeft to this government ; and
this at a moftient of danger, when citizens
of other countries might be called home
from this country. He thought this would
be extremely wrong, it would be giving an
opportunity for insult to our court? and
country, and he was sure no nation would
shew us so much complaisance in return,
Mr. Claiborne thought it no more bin
ding for citizens born in the United States
to continue citizeas of the United States,
than it was for a Romae Catholie or Protes
tant, to continue of that opinion, when he
arrived at years of maturity, and could
judge for himfelf. He infifled upon it men
had a natnral right to choose under what
government they would live ; and they had
no reason to fear our citizens leaving us
whilst our government was well executed.
He did not wish citizens of the U. States
to be in the situation of fubjedts of Great
Britain, who, tho' they had left the country
40 years ago, were liable to be considered as
fubjedts of that Government. He trusted
the rights of man would not be thus infrin
ged, but that they should allow the right of
expatriation unclogged.
Mr. Sewall said three was a great dif
ference betwixt the two cases which the
gentleman had Hated. A man born and ed
ucattd in a counary certainly owed it obliga
tions which were not to be shaken off the
moment he chose to do so. The different
societies of the world, he said, were like so
many families independent of each other;
and what family, he asked, would fuffer any
of its members to leave it, and go into ano
ther, when they pleased ? He thought it
unreasonable that it should be so.
Mi". W. Smith (Ch.) said, the dodtrine
of perpetual allegiance was derived from G.
Britain, which, though it might be good in
theory, was not in pradtice. They had de
parted from many dodtrines derived from
that country, and the time was come, he be
lieved, for departing from this. The idea
of a man being compelled to live in this
country, contrary to his will, seemed to be
repugnant to our ideas of liberty. He
thought when a man was so difgvftcd with
the country, at to refolvc to leave it, for the
purpose of becoming a citizen of another
eountry, he should be at liberty to do so on
his complying with certain formalities, and
should never again be re-admitted. It was
upon thi* principle that this fedtion was
founded, and he thought if valuable.
Ms. S. Thought this fedtion efTential at
it would'be the meant of preventing quar- 1
re Is with foreign countries. For itiftanCe,
if â¢ citizen of this count'y took command
! of a French riilp of **nr, and were to corn- |
j mit boftilhies on the property of citizens of J
the United States ; if he were taken, he
might allidge he was a citizen of the French
Republic, and that government might claim
him as inch ; but if this bill palled, no man
could cover himfelf under this pretence who
: had not complied with the remjifitions in.
. this ad. He mentioned the cafe (|f Mr.-
s Talbot.
Mr. S. said they had held out iiidi&e
---: menti for perfoas to come to this country.
we dul not allow they owed allegiance to any
Â» other country after theV had become citizens
i of this. To jrrant this, would be a fatal
s tiodtrine t<i this country. It? would he to
. declare, that in cafe we were at war with
another country, that country might recal
s persons from this, who formerly came from
>f thence. Many persons of that description
5 were amongst us. At prtfent, they enjoy
ed all the benefits of our law, and voted at
li our eledtions ; and yet,'"if this doftrine
â  were admitted, these persons might be re
if called as aliens ; and, if. they were not re
)â¢ called, they would be considered as qualifi
â¢ ed aliens, and not as real citizens.
- This law, Mr. S. said, was as
i- at present there was not fufficient energy in
- the government, to jninilh persons serving
on board foreign (hips of War. This bill
;, would cure the evil, and give an opportu
i nity for turbulent, discontented charadters,
t to leave the country, for ever. He believed
t,' it was the general opinion of the citizens of
if this country, that they had a right to expa
;, triate themselves, and he thought it was now
e a proper time to past some regulations on
e that fubjedt.
i. Mr. Sitgreaves thought this one of
the mod delicate and important fubjedts that
e ever came before Congress. He saw a num
ber of difficulties ; but he thought they
t were not of a nature to discourage them
from considering the bill ; he trusted they
11 Ihould meet them with firmnefs.
The evil, he said, "which gave rife to this
e bill, was a great and growing One. In the
y firft war which had taken place in Europe
since our Independence, they found this
if, do&rine of expatriation, as claimed by our
e ! citizens, endangering our peace with a for
i, | eign nation ; and if this principle were ad
> mated, he feared we ihould always be liable
- to similar embarrafTments.
Mr. S. took notice of the different objec- '
d tions made to this fedtion. He obferved
i, there seemed to be much doubt on the fub
d jedt, which he thought ought to be remov
t ed by passing a law of this fort. He wished
il he could agree in the opinion, that no citi
e zen had a right to expatriate himfelf from
! this country. He thought it a dodtrine es
s fential to the peace of society. He wished
; it was generally recognized ; but he believed
- the major opinion in this country was dif
r ferent; and though not diredtly, it had in a
i. great degree been recognized by the execu
n tive and judiciary, in the cases of Henfield
s and Talbot. He feared, therefore, it was
1 too late for to fay' the right did not
0 exist ; it was time, however, for Congress
e to declare an opinion oft the fubjedt. If the
" propqfitjon in the bill was not a proper one,
1 it" should be' made so.
e In the state of Virginia, this dodtrine was
J legalized, and in the constitution of Penn
r fylvania, it was ftrbngly indicated, as it said,
:t " emigration should not be prohibited." It
a was a favorite idea of a republican govern
i- ment not to forbid it. lie did not agree
d with the principles of the clause in all its
e parts. He thought citizens ought not to
d be allowed to expatriate in time of war, as
is their affifiance would te wanted at home,
e It was his intention-to have moved an amend
d ment, allowing expatriation only in time of
n peace, aHd an express provision against it in
d time of war. He thought the dodtrine of
d the gentleman from Maryland, viz. that our
citizens ought to go into <*ther countries to
l- learn the art of war, was chimerical. When
:s they had- obtained rank and wealth in a so
s, reign country, it would be in vain to call
f. them backâthey would not return. He
ic hoped, therefore, the fedtion would not be
d struck out, but that they should proceed to
n amend it.
it Mr. N. Smith was sorry that the com
d mittee who reported this bill, had thought
is it necessary to report the 6th and 7th fec
1. tions. The dodtrine of expatriation on one
:s hand, and perpetual allegiance on the other,
it were fubjedts they had all heard much about;
y but expatriation, under limitation and re
ts flraint, was a new business. From its no
d velty it became doubtful. This being the
1- cafe, he wished the fubjedt had been defer
>f red to an ordinary feflion. Particularly as
it appeared to be no more connected with
f- other parts of the bill, than with many other
e laws now extant. If we were to have a law
l- on this fubjedt, he should wish to have it in
1- a separate bi11... For hÂ» part, he could not
e fee how the committee could suppose it to
t have been a part of their duty to report these
0 fedtions ;"if he had thought it had, he should
; not have voted for appointing a committee
y on the occasion.
1. Gentlemen advocating these clauses, fay
t they would not allow of expatriation in time
of war. He would go further and fay, he
e would not allow of it when there was a pro
. fpedt of war ; for it would be idle to pro
n hibit it in one -cafe, and not in the other.
> He then asked, if this was not the very ilate
1 in which we now were ? If it were, why
- pass such a bill at this time, when it could
i not go into operation ? He thought this a
s good reason for rejecting these clauses. *
t There was a mutual obligation, Mr. S.
e said, between a government and all its citi
zens. The government -owed protection
c to its citizens, and citizens owed obedience
r to their government. These duties were
1 mutual and co-extensive ; and they might as
1 well fay that government could abandon its
j citizens when it pleased, as that citizens
1 could desert their government when they
pleased" j yet he would allow that government
> might, on certain occaGont, legalize expa
triation, but not On the ground of a citizen's
, having a right to expatriate when he pleased.
1 He should have no objection to take up the
fubjeft 4t a time whf~ they could do justice
to it, but he thought the present was not
that.time.
The qtteftion for'ltrikiug out the 6tli feo
ticin, was put and carried 45 to 41. The
7th flection, which was as follows, fell of
courfie : *
, ". That all persons who (hall exercise the
right os-expatriation, according to the laws
of the United States, (hall be and are here
by prohibited from becoming citizens of the
Utjjted States forever thereafter."
Mr. Harper proposed an amendment,
which intended to introduce a new prin
ciple.âAs the bill now flood, no person
coul4 tq into foreign service without incur
ring the penalties therein provided ; but he
behVved there might be cases where it would
be for the benefit of this country to allow
persons to go into foreign service. He there
fore wished to strike out the words " the
limits of the fame," to introduce those of
" without fiaviny ftrfi bltaineii leave from the
PrcfidcrJ of the United States."
Mr. Claiborn thought the powers of the
President large enough, and (lid not wi(h to
increase them, nor to lay additional daty
upon him.
Mr. Vf.nable did net think, it neceflary
to entrust the President with such a power.
He did not believe it was the practice of any
country to grant a power of this kind, ex
cept in cases of officers, who, when they
wi(hed {o go abroad, alked leave, because al
ways liable to be called upon.
Mr. DayTon (the speaker) moved to
strike out the words moved to be struck out
by the gentleman from S. Carolina, with the
addition of the word " without." As the
bill flood, he laid, there was a provision a
gainst citizens who accepted and exercised
a commission within or without the limits of
the United States ; but none against those
who accepted within, and exercised it with
out the limits, or who accepted it without,
and exercised it within the limits. He was
against lodging the power proposed in the
President for the reasons assigned by the
gentleman from Virginia. Nor did he think
it would be attended with advantage for our
citizens to go abroad to learn what could
not be learnt at home ; he believed, in doing
so, they wot)ld learn more vice than virtue,
and bring home a greater portion of evil than
good. ~ !&,â¢
* Mr. Swanwick was surprised, that after
all that had been objefted against our citi
-1 zen 3 entering into the service of foreign
countries, that gentlemen should bring for
ward a proposition to atlthorife the President
to grant them leave to go into it when he
(hall think proper. This would be placing
the President in a very delicate situation ;
because if he allowed citizens to go to fight
in one country, he must allow them to go
into another, or there would be a breach of
neutrality ; and it would be an unpleasant
thing to refufe applications of this kind.
No advantage could be derived from this
plan, equal to the disadvantages of thus
placing the power. Indeed, he thought
the proposition an argument against the bill
itfelf.
After a few obfemtions from Mr. Har
per and Mr. Sewall, the question on the a
mendment .of Mr. -Dayton, was negatived
44 to s9'
I Mr. Dayton hoped some remedy would
be applied to the evil he had mentioned; and
1 that they should not report so imperfect a
, bill.
Mr. Sewall fuggeftcd a way in which
it tpight be remedied in the house. The
committee accordingly rose, and the House
took vip the amendments. Having come
to that for ftrikingout the 6th and 7th fac
tions.
Mr. Dent called for the yeas and nays,
which were agreed to be taken.
Mr. Vlnable said, it seemed to be ad
mitted that a right of expatriation existed
in our citizens ; and if so, he thought there
should be some mode of exercifingthat right.
He had no particular obje&ion to the mode
marked out in these clauses. It had been
said this was not the proper time, but he
thought it fince it was in some degree
connected with the present bill. The gen
tleman from Connecticut had stated allegi
ance and protection to be mutual. He did
not think they were so, to the extent which
he stated. This government was not bound
to protest citizens who went into fqreign
service, as in doing so they chose the pro
tection of another government.
Mr. Harper asked for an instance in
which the executive andjudfeiary had coun
tenanced the dodtrine'of expatriation.
Mr. Nicholas thouhgt it would have
been better to have avoided taking up this
subjeCt at pre Tent 5 but having taken it up,
if the bill passed at all, he believed it had
better pass with some regulations at the pre
sent. As to thf doftrine of perpetual alle
giance,hedid not think it could findmany ad
vocates in this country. It would, indeed
be dishonorable for us to hold out such a
doftrine, after inviting people to come here
in crowds from foreign countries. This
drxftrin* he said would affeCt a third or fourth
of the whole people of this country. He
thought, therefore, ttfÂ£ right of expatria
tion ought at least to be confirmed here, as
an example to other countries.
Mr. W. Smith in answer to his col
league, produced the cafe of Talbot, and
the opinion given by -the Secretary of State
and by thc'Judicrary court on that occasion,
in favour of the right of expatriation.
Mr. Giles thought there could not be a
doubt in the minds of Americans on the fpb-*
jest of expatriation. Indeed, he said, this
was the foundation of our revolution ; for
they were not now, he said, to be told they
owed allegiance to a foreign country. It
had not only been the gr.iund of the revo
lution, but all their afts had been predicated
upon this principle. He referred to the aft
refpedtingthe rightsof naturalization, which
makei every new citizen swear to support
the conflitution of the United States, and
to renounce all other allegiance.
Mr. Gallatin was opposed to these
feftioM. With refptfft to expatriation, hav
ii.g himfelf exercised that right, he could
riot be supposed to be opposed to that right.
Perpetual allegiance was too absurd a doc
trine to find many advocates in this country.
The question was not whether citizens had
a right to expatriate, but whether they
should in this law prescribe a mode of doing
it. The doCtrine seemed to have been
recognized by the Executive and judici
ary, He was against going into this bu
iinefs, because he thought it unneceflary.
He believed the determination of who
were Citizens and who were not, might be
fafely left with the judiciary. He also had
lu6 doubts whether the United States had a
right to regulate this matter, |or whether it
should not be left to the ftate3, as the con
fl'tution spoke of the citizens of the States.
It was a dotibiful matter, and ought to un
dergo a full discussion, The emigrants from
this country to foreign countries were trifling
âbut from 10 to 12,000 of our citizens had
gone to Canada, and upwards of 5000 bey
ond the Miffifippi, 4000 of whom would be.
got back by the running of the lines. A
number of these men hold lands in the Uni
ted States ; some have fold their lands and
become citizens under another government.
This subjeCt would, therefore, require con
siderable deliberation at a future day. He
wiftied the amendment of the committee of
the whole to be adopted. ,
Mr. Sitgreaves confirmed his former
statement with refpedt to the question of the
right of expatriation having been fettled by
the Judiciary. In order to do tlys, he read
a note from one of the counsel in the eases of
Henfield and Talbot, giving an account of
! the opinions of the court on the occasion.
\ Mr, Sewall infilled upon the policy' of
| preventingtherenunciationofallegiancewith
; out controul. The treaty of peace with G.
Britain he said, had diflolved our allegiance
â  to that country, and acknowledged our in
dependence.
Mr. Giles believed the evil apprehended
from individuals having the right to expatri
ate themfelvs when they pleased, was more
imaginary, than real. Only two citizens had
taken advantage of that right in the (late of
Virginia, where it was allowed in all its ex
tent, in twelve years! But if there were any
citizens so detached from the government, at
to wifli to leave the country, ne should wiih
them gone. To suppose this, would be to
fuppofc a real divifioii betwixt the people
and government, which he did not believe had
existence. It was said Great Britain did nÂ»t
allow the doftrine of expatriation; But he
said, (he had not any naturalization law. He
was in favour of excluding citizens who once
expatriated themfelvei from ever returning to
this country.
Mr. Thatcher did not think the princi
ple was so important as It had been'confider
ed. The great emigrations which we every
day saw to this country, miglir quiet their
apprchenfions of many goingy"rt>m it. He
did not think one man a year would take ad
vantage of the expatriation clause for 50
to come, which could be no great objefl ef
pceially when it was coufidered that these
would probably be the lead veluable of our
citizens.
Mr. Gordon was in favnuf- of the amend
ment of the committee of tjie whole, though he
could not fay he had wholly made tip his mind
Upon the subject. He thought theft fefliorts
important, and perfeftly di-ftir.<Â£l from the bill;
he, therefore, wiftied the confiderition of this
matter to toe postponed to a perio'd when they.
Ihould have more letfure for the difciiflTon. ..,
Mr. Otis said, that when- this bill was firft
reported, these clauses ftrm It him unfavorably;
but a little reflection had convinced him of the
propriety of retaining tfiem. The pafling. of
this proviGon, he said, would not affedt the
conftituticnal right with refpeil to expatriation,
whatever it might be. This bi.l did not relate,
to persons emigrating intÂ® the Spanilh or Â£n
glifh territories, but to perlons expatriating,
therafelves, and engaging in the service of fo
reign countries.
The question on agreeing to the report of the

Mr. Pa.r ke r moved the order of the <ja*y
on the bill from the Senate; providing (or
the proteftion of the trade of the United
States, and the House accordingly went in
to a committee on that fubjeft. ': ~
The bill having bein read, some observa
tions took place refpecling the fixing of the
price of feameti's wages, instead of leaving
it to the difcreation of thePrefident, but ro
question was taken; as it was fuggeffed the
othec parts of the bill had better firft be
gone through.
Mr. Pakkir,, moved to strike out tlie
following fefiion, of thebill, viz. -
" Th'at the President of the -Unfted State*
be, and he is hereby authorized jnd em
powered, (hould-he deem in expedient, tÂ»
pause to be procured by purchase or other
wise and to be fitted out, manned, & employ
ed, a number of vessels, not exceeding,
nine, to carry, not exceeding twenty guni
each."
Mr. P, thought, if the revenue cutten
were armed, as had before been suggested,
there-would be no necdlity for tbe
here proposed, which he did not think 16
well calculated for service as them. They
would carry 10 or 12 guns, ar.d from 40 to â¢
yo men, ttffd would be able to cope with
any small privateer on our eoaft, or in the
Weft-Indies. He proposed to introduce a
ntw clause for this purpose.
Mr. 8. Smith thought the objeft of thÂ«
geutlemtJi last up might be attained byamending this-.l.iufo. Ho was hi'
iwQr of the cutters, as tltey w<>ukl not only"
lerve as a difence frtr our coalt, hut as ten
ders to the frigates. Nihe vessels of io
guns, lie fa id, would require 674 fearnen
to man them, and the frigates would require
432 able,and' 300 ordinary fearnen, which
he did not believe would be vsry readily
railed. Belides- veffek which would bepur
chnfed for this would not be cal
culated for the fcrvice, not being fufficiently
lÂ»vift sailers, wltihl these cutters would out
sail molt privateers, atid half the fearnen
would be lufijcient. They might be ready
in a fortnight, whilst the others could not
be lit for sea for three month:.
Mr. Parker had thought of amending
the bill in the way proposed ; but he found
fwne objections to that mode. It would be
ntcelTary that the cutters (hould be employ.
irt the protection of our revenue, as 'w ell
as to guard ottr coait; and, on that account
he believed it would be better not to include
them under the naval eftablilhmpnt, as they
would not, in that cafe, be-so much"at the
command of the secretary of the treasury.
I he question was carried without a divi
sion ; the claufc following, which respeCted
the officers and crew to be employed, fell of
courfc.
Mr. Giles moved to ltrike out the fol
lowing clause, for the purpose of inferring
a similar one to that agreed to in the bill for
the gallies,. yiz. to Confine their use within
thejurifdiclion of the United States :
. " That the President of the United States
may employ the said frigates and the said
vessels, to protect the Ihips and cargoes be
longing solely to citizens'of the United
States, and also the harbors and fea-coalt of
the United States, infuch manner and under
such regulations as (hall in no wife contravene
either the laws of nations, or any existing
treaties between the United States and fo
reign nations."
Mr. W. Smith hoped this amendment
would not be agreed to. He believed it
was never attended to confine the frigates
within so narrow a sphere. sie believed
the latter part of the clause proposed to be
(truck out would prevent any mifchief.
The Commanders of these vessels, he said,
would be men of abilities and Character,
well inltructed as to their duty with respeCt
to the Law of Nations. If the Frigates
were to be thusconfined in their operations,
they would be of no real use.
Mr. Giles wilhed to know to what o- ;
ther purpose, besides the protection of our
coad, the gentlemen wilhed to employ these (
vessels. It seemed to be tho't the Frigates
Could be of no use, except as convoys; but
he' denied that they were equal to that objeCt
if it were agreed that they ihould be so em
ployed. It was said the cutters to be em
ployed were to aft as Tenders to the Fri
gates ; yet they were to be kept at home;
it would therefore be curious to fend the
frigates abroad, and keep the tenders' at
home. To employ the frigates in any o
ther way than for the protection-os ourcoaft,
would, in his opinion, hazard the Peace of !
the country, without producing any good;
for if he was a merchant (and he believed the
merchants were generally of that opinion),
he would sooner fend his vessel unprotected,
than with the proposed convoy.
Mr. SitGreavcs argued againlt theabfnrdi
ty of confining the operations of our maritime
forte to the narrow limits proposed by the a
mendmentâlt was the ohjedl of the bill to de
fend our commerte from the unjust attaÂ«ks of
the belligerent powers, and it surely would not
be pretended that these attacks v ere confined to
Our coastsâTo render the protedticin efficient,
it should be co-exteÂ»live with the dangerâand
ihould the'ffigates not be permitted to operate
beyond the imaginary line which limits our ma
ritime jurifdi&ion on the sea coast, it would
frequently happen that they would be vbligcd
tÂ« submit to the capture of their cotvoys. within
fhereaeh of their gunsâlt would be infinitely
preferable |to ditmaiitle oÂ«r (hipt of war, and
live the expence of their equipment, than to
hold out to our trade an illufivt protection,
which would only lead them into dangerâThe
picaroon* which infeft the American seas would
Uffkiently understand the reitriflion which it
propolcd, and would be rather incited by it
than discouragedâHe wai therefore decidedly
against the amendment, but neither did he like
the clause as It flood in the billâHe did not
tomprthsr.d the propriety of limiting the pro
tection of the frigates to the cafe of " vessels
and cargoes owned solely by American citizens'
-âln some inflancesit ought not to be extended
so far, in others it ought to go fartherâVeffels
ami eafjoe. owned entirely by our own citizens
â¢Ihigjht be employed in a contraband trade and
ought not to be prete&cd ; although this con
ilru&ioa perhaps was corrected by the latter
part of the .clause, yet there was an opposite
evil which would necessarily arile from it in its
preient formâShips owned by American citi-
Mere â¢ntitled to the protection of the go
' .ViTr.meut againlt French cruisers, while engag
ed In a lawful trade, let their cargoes belong to
whinti tliey mightâlt is one stipulation of our
commercial treaty with France that free Ihips
mike free goodsâand whatever might be the
opinion of this house at to the expediency of
reluiquifhiwg this stipulation by a newcoinpafl,
yet until this could be effected in a courfc of ne
-gOeiatioa, we c annot abandon the advantages
if gives to our citizensâThe rights giowing
out oftreaty are as much objefljof protection as
thole ariCng Imm the law of nationtâand he
could never consent to such an abandonment of
' them, untilthe reliiions of the two countries in
this refpefl Ihould be legitimately changedâlf
the peefent amendment therefore should not
prevail, it was his intentioa to move to fubfti
. tute for ftie words " ihips and cargoes belong
iiÂ»g solely to citizens of the United States" the
[ exprriiioM the lawful commerce of the citi-
I zens of the United States."
J Mr. Nicholas concluded the gentleman
1 was not in the House when this subjeCt was
I formerly under difcufiion, as he seemed to
I have (tumbled upou all the objections, which
I were then abandoned. fThofe gentlemen
1 who- had advocated convoys completely gave
them up, [Mr. Smith denied that he had
ever gave them up.] Mr. N. believed he
sever did, on any other account than because
every body about him gave.them up, and a
clause directly the reverse of his was agreed
to. Mr. N. then went over the arguments
which were gone into on a former cccafion.
He (hewed that this force was inadequate to
the protection of our commerce, and that
the uatural confequencc of refilling a search
or being takeii'ifito a foreign trial,
on the ground of a c;jrgo bciag-Aona fide
neutral,' would Hfoddce v- ar. And should
ytc, he _afl<ed,'while a negpeiation was pÂ»nd-*
ing, run the risk oragain involving ourselves
in difficulties ? He trufled we (hould not.
He denied that the effect of the amendment
could be to confine the frigates within the
jurisdiCtion of the Unifld States, as the
commerce within the jurisdiCtion might be
defended by their going without it. He
trusted the amendment would, be agreed
to.
Mr. Dayton* (the speaker) wished, to
(trike out the seCtion, and inferF* nothing.
He was not prepared to fay the Frigates
(hould or should not be employed as con
voys ; hor was he ready to fay they (hould
be confined Within the jurisdiCtion of thtf
United States. He was willing to leave"
this business to the President of the Uftited
States, as commander in chief. He was
sure that confidence would not be. abused ;
and he believed he would have better oppor
tunities than they had, of determining the
bed menner of employing them.
Mr. Parker seconded the motion. He
thought it would be highly improper in
tbem to dictate to the President how he
(hould use these vessels. He wilhed that to
reft on the broad basis of the President's.
responsibility.
Mr. W. Smith had no objeCiion to the
business taking this course. As Command
er in Chief, there was no doubt the Presi
dent would employ this naval.force in a man
ner which, in his opinjoh, would be mod
conducive to the publicgood. If the nego
ciation failed, and there (liould be a necessity
for employing it in a manner differently
from what they at prefeat contemplated, he
wouJA of course do so. Mr. S.'took no
tice of what had fallen from Mr. Nicholas ;
he denied that what had been determined
relative to the gallies, had any connexion
with the frigates. He said, in our treaty
with' Holland and Sweden, convoys for our
trtde in time of peace were positively (tipu
lated for, the word of th e commander
of our convoy was always to be taken, as
to the description of our cargoes ; therefore
the arguments of that gentleman fell to the
gronnd, when he said our vessels could not
go out to sea without endangering our
peace. It was true there was no such arti
cle in our treaty with France, but it was sti
pulated in what manner search (hould be
I made. The Swedifii treaty, he said, was
' made by Dr. Franklin, at Versailles, under
; the eye of the French Government., It
was to be supposed, therefore, it met with
| their full approbation, efpecfally as it had
never been complained agairift.
Mr. Nicholas said, that there being
stipulations of the kind mentioned by the
gentleman last. up, provided that no such
right existed without a treaty ; and.as to the
manner in which a search should be made
being laid down, it was ho fecuritv agaiuft
the evil he dreaded. He denied the right
of the President to apply the naval force of
| the Uuited States to any object he pleas
; ed. When a force was raised for a partiev-
I lar objeCt, he agreed that it was his business
to direCt the manner in which ,this force
(hould be used ; but to fay tliat he had a
right to apply it-at his discretion was to
make him majler of the United States, if that
were the cafe, he said, the powers of that
House were gone. When they raised men
for the protection of the frontier, would the
President, he jilted, fend them to any other
place J He infilled upon it that they had
a right to fay the vessels (liould be kept in
the river Delaware, if they pleafed;â-the
President might afterwards'direCt their con
duCt. If a contrary doCtrine were to pre
vail, if they did not give up the right of de
claring war, they gave up a power which
would inevitably lead to war.
Mr. Br.ookes did not apprehend any
danger from leaving it in the power of' the
President to make use of the frigates as he
pleased.
Mr. Gallatin said, that after having
determined that the three frigates (hould be
got ready for feS, it became necessary to fay
upon what business they (hould be employed.
There might be different opinions on the
subjeCt, but it was necessary to define the
objeCt. If not, they had reason to appre
hend, from his-Speech, that the President
would employ them as convoys. The dif
ficulties attending such an employ, had
been (hewn when the fuhjeCt of gallies were
under confidcration; they were so many
that the peace of the country would be
greatly endangered by by such an employ
ment of the frigates. The danger was
greatly increased by the disputed articles of
our treaty with France, which the President
would be under the necessity of enforcing.
In ordinary times, he said, the principle of
the gentlemen from New-Jersey was a good
one. If we hatj frigates in service, they
were not from day to day to fay how they
(hould be employed; but, under,our present
circumstances, he throught the objeCt
ought to be defined, and that they ought to
depart from the maxint laid down bo that
gentlemen.
Mr. Sewall wis in favor of ftrikrngout the
claufc .Ifthe I'refidcnt Were to be limited at all he
(hould have no objuAion to limit bhn with refjxifl
to convoys, from the incompetency of three vessels
to that end; hut these frigates w ere to be conlider
ed as the public force, as the navy of the United
States. It was true it was a small one, hut itjwat
such at congress had thought, proper to rai'e, and
put in the power of the President. And why
Ciouldthls power be limited ? It seemed as if t'hejr
fuppofed,from his naturaldifpofition.or from (baie
other cause, he would abuse it, by employing the
vessels contrary to iaw, and thereby involve the
country i* a war.
j'he constitution, Mr. S said, had defined himto
be command* r in thief of the navy, and having a
navy, the command of cenrfe devolved upon him.
If these vessels were Vuilt for a particular pttrpofe,
they might detonate thur objed, but they were
thrrity to â¢' equip and employ these vessels." If
a that peric d whi 11, in the opinion of many gen
tlrmen, there Wai a greater pi ofpeA of war than
at prcient, 110 object w-r* pointed--* u for the vef
fels,he did not fee why any should now be pointed
out. With to thcdif)tted articles in the
Fref th treaty, they had already ejprcff.J >:i epin
ion 'ta the'PriftJerit, wiiic fie douSteJ tot ifoiji
have its - â¢* '
Mr Williams thought that haviqÂ®: given the
.President a difcretfOnary power io the firtt Ititloii
of the bill'they. aught not now tÂ« t >ltc it from him
because, if "he did nÂ»t fee oocalion to niiu the fri
gates, he would never do it; but if 'he fee oc
cafiun for manning them, they ought not to take
from him the of employing them as he
pleased. He jwas therefore in favpr of the motion
of the gentleman from New Jcrfvy.
' IVfr Gl l.jr.i al]ced,Â»vhether tn'afctrtain the object
upon which these Vcffels (hould hacmptoyed, was
a Initiative or an executive a*il ? It was certainly
a legislative. They ought to.f-y to the President,
" Here is, she force, and there is the objeA." It
wis laid they, had already, given an opinion to the
President, with rclpcS to the difpurcd article* in
the French treaty. ? hr: rrdtv wrfhed a law to bÂ«
pa* Ted in conformity to that opinion.
They were often charged, Me. Giles said, with
a waut of confidence in the President. He was
free to own he had nut. much confidence in the pre
fent'Prefident. His speech, St the opening of.the
feflion, had deftroy'ed all histonfidence; but,how
ever high their opinion might be of the Executive,
they oÂ»jht.Ooft>Â» lodge impiopcr powers in his
* ia " â¢ -
Mr. HAR.PiR was in favor of the motion. He
wiihud tjO provide force, and not to direift the
use of iti he biheved this was the objeA for
which they were called together. He was wil
ling to leave the use of this force to theprefidcrft
-r-bcoaufe he-could rirrployit in 2 manner -only
applicable to. peace-; to employ it otherwise
would be a breach of his power. He therefore
could not repel any violation of our rights by
force, except previously authorized by Con
gress
â¢" THe gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Harper,
said, need not to.have told them he had no con
fidence in the present executive. He might
have said in no executive 5 for it waa well
known he never milled going out the way
to fay rude thiÃgs of the late president; but he
did not believe this was the best way.of difcharg
â iiig their duty. Hebel evtd the public cared lit
tle what hU opinion of the President was; he
thought they ought to do their duty, and leave
the preliucnt to This. Jir. Harper denied that
they haclthe right to d : reit the public force.. If
we were at war with Great-Britain, they fhouli?
have no right to fay to the president attack Ca
nada or the Ulands. The use of this force niuft
be left with the president; if he abuses it, upon
his own head would lie the refponfihility, and
not upon them*
Mi. S. Smith had not made up his mind
ou the fubjedt. If the power of employing
the frigates was wholly left with the Presi
dent, though he had not 'he power of de
claring war, yet he might so employ them as
to lead to war, particularly with refpelk to
the French treaty articles. Ou the other
hand, it seemed to be a poor employment for
these frigates, after all the expoace which they
had cost, to keep them wiihin thejurifdiftion
of the United States. They could not
cruise there, indeed, without danger of run.
nir>g on the (hoali. Underloading, as he
did, that by voting tor the striking out of'
tbii-claufe, he (henid net be precluded from
voting for the amendment of the gentleman
from Virginia, if he (hould conclude to do
so, he Ihould vote for ft 1 iking out the fefticn
in question.
Mr. Macon proposed a clutfe Cmiiar inef.
tet\ to that proposed by the gentleman from
Virginia, to be infertedin place of the one
struck outâbut the chairman declared it not
in order.
Mr. Dayton said, that those gentlemen
who were not prepared to Vote for retaining
the li th feflion, mull W 'prepared to fay
these frigates Iha|l be employad at convoy?.
It war to Uraid tliis, that he had moved tb
lirike it out.. He again fxprcfled his- vrifh
that "the direflrao of this force, might be' left
with the President.
Mf.,Crr'i.Sj declared his intention of voting
sbr (IrTkiijg out {he feflipn,. and to rilk the
inferfion of another afterwards.
The queftiun for striking' out was carried
without, a division.
Mr. Giles tliei moved to insert the fee

fine the life of our fiigates ta the proteflion
of our coasts, and commerce within the ju

REPORTS.
Those who are delighted with reports, must
have been highly gratified lor two days part ;
for it was reported,.and by many believed,that
Tom Paink had arrived in the (hip Steady, 1
from Bordeaux; who, it was said, had come j
ashore in difjuife, to prevent his being known. |
This detedls itfclf. No one who knows Tom Â»
Patni, would believe, were he to arrive in. A' j
merica, that he would appear in any other cha- .
raf\er thin that of a man oiOÂ»rimcn Senjt, not- j
withitanding the influence which the Wff tf 1
Reajon might have, over his enemies.
Anathcr report was, that an augmentation of
the pay of the land forces of England and Ire-'
land was demanded. This, it was laid, a paper
of a late date brought by the Orion, from Cork
contained. As we received the latefl paper by
this arrival, without this nezi's, it is highly pro
bable that it is unfounded; though such an
event may be said to be a natural confcquence
of the Teamen's late fuccefsful demand.
And a third was, that Mr. Pitt was succeeded
in office by the marquis of Lanfdowr.e- âThis
is much the merest report.
By the next arrivals, the public will, in all
probability, be .furnilhed with much informa

The Commissioners
TTOR carrying into effedf the sixth article of the
Jl'treaty of amity,commerce and navigation, con
cluded bet we \1 his Britannic majesty and the United
States of America, on the 19th day of November,
1794, having this day conftitutcd their Board,
pursuant and"agreeably to the said treaty, do here
by giye notice, that they are ready to proceed to
business accordingly ; and they desire that all claims
under the said article (which so far as the fame de
scribes the cases thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
They further desire that all such claims may not
or.lyXtate in what manner the fcvcril cases come
within the description of the said article, but alto
fet forth .he nature of the evidence by
which the claimants refpeAively undertake tsfub
ftantiate the fame.

â¢' debts to a confid. rable amount, which were bona
" fide contracted, before the ftill remain

'â¢ only the full recovery of the said debtÂ» has been
" delayed, but also the value and fecunty thereof
" have been in feyeraf instances impaired and jdT
Â»' ened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial
" proceedings, the Britilh creditors cannot bow
" obtain and a dually have and receive full and

" ved by the said creditors in the ordinary court:
" of justice, the United States will make full and
" complete compensation for the fame to the said
Â« creditors: but it is diftincftly understood, that
11 this provision is to extend to such losses only as
" have been occasioned by the lawful impediments
Â« aforefaid, and is not to extend to losses occa&on
" ed by such insolvency of the debtors or pthcr
