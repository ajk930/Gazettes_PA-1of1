Upon this news be!''g made public yester
day ; general orders were ifliied to the yeo
manry to parade, at fix o'clock in the even
ing, at their several alarm polls, furnilhed â 
with ball cartridge. 1
In consequence of this order, a very mi- t
mereus attendance of the different corpsâ
the lawyers and attornies corps, cavalry and
infantry (which had been formally dismissed '
from duty, in order that the members might 1
attend to their private affairs in the several .
parts of the country) rauftered in great
force, and not the least abatement appeared
' to have taken place in that zeal which has
so often been roused with effect for the pre
servation of the metropols.
Notwithstanding the anxiety manifefted '
by our gallant fellow soldiers for immediate '
dtry, it was not thoaght neceflSry t6 em
ploy them upon any service, and they were
dismissed, with directions to hold themselves
in readiness in cafe of any alarm.
No such alarm took place, and the night
pass d wiih perfeft tranquility.
K.illala bay, where the Freftch fiqnoiron
is stated to have landed their men, is a small
inlet of the Atlantic ocean, in which the
little town of Killala is seated, in the county
of Mayo, and about 127 miles NW. from
Dublin. The town is an episcopal seeâ
the present bishop is Dr. Stock.
It is supposed that the number of French
landed at this place does not exceed 800
men. A small pariy of about 20 of the
Northampton fencibles quartered there, is
said to have opposed their landing, but, as
may be ttafily imagined, without any etfeft.
This fquadroH is said to be the fame which
failed sometime ago from Bourdeaux, in
o-der to make a diversion on the NW. coall
of this kingdom, while the main squadron
should fail from Brest and land troops at
Lough Svvilly. Happily the vigilance of
tne Britifli Seet has locked up the latter in
the French harbour, and thus baffled this
last desperate attempt of the Irish traitors;
while the petty invasion 3t Killala, abandon
ed as a miferabie and forlorn hope, must be
ci<t offâthe (hips by the superior naval force
which is now upon the north weft coast, and
the trgops by the indigttant valour of Irish
loyalifis.
A fliort time will, v/t trust, produce a
fortunate and aecifive issue to this new trea
son of those abandoned mifcrsants; who,
to gratify dia'uol cal ambition, would (trew
the country with carnage, might they ortly
hope to rule amidst the desolation of Ire
lard.
It was yesterday reported that the bishop
of Killala had fallen into the hands of the
French troops; but we have good reason
to believe this report utterly untrue-
The counties of Wicklow and Wexford
are completely secured by a powerful mili
tary force.
We understand that it is the intention of
government not to permit any of the chiefs
of the rebellion co be included in the am
refly, who shall be the future cause of any
effuiion of blocd ; and that it has been de
clared to them, and that if they expeft fa
vour, they must take immediately advan
tage of the mercy of our chief governor.

NEW-YORK, October 13.
With extreme pleasure dÂ® we an
nounce the fafe arrival of Gen. Pinck
ney and family, in the Fruffian ihip De
Hoop, Capt. Hendrickfon, which came f
up to this city, yesterday afternoon, as- f
ter a passage of sixty days from Bour- {
deayx. ... t
We are sorry that the afflifted state of \
our city prevents the General from land
ing, otherwise, we are confident, that >
even the few inhabitants now in town, t
would, with public acclamations, wcl- \
come the arrival of a ruin whose con- (
' duÂ£t in France has been marked by I
that firmnefs, probity, and intelligence, ;
which must endear him to every honest {
and patriotic American.
The General will disembark to day at ;
Paules-hook, and proceed to Trenton, ;
where he will be received with open <
arms by those officers of our govern- ;
ment, who have taken refuge from the ]
fever. (
The General observed to us, that if j
we. are UNITED and ENERGETIC, ,
we have nothing to fear from France; ;
but, without these two ingredients in t
| our councils and nation, the evils of a 1
war may be conjidered as a probable ,
event, 1
To the politeness of the General, we â¢
j are indebted for a file of French papers 1
j as late as the jath of August; from ,
! which we extra/ft the following insidi
ous idecree, the dark tendency of which,
our readers are too enlightened not to
be sensible of, and too honest not to ab
hor. This fyi Wt song, intended as a
lullaby to Americans is signed by honejl
Merlin, of privateering memory, who
last year when Minister of Justice, was
the source whence ifiued all those pirati
cal opinions, which organized and fanc
tioned-the most unbounded depredations
on our dpfencelefs commerce by myriads
of French tree-booters, in many of
which he was known to be interested.

arrival wc are informed, that
" On the 27th of August. about 1800
French troops, principally officers, landed
in Sligo bay, in the county of Galway, and
had intrenched themselves with near y 200
pisces of cannon. They attacked general
Lake in p-afant's'dref<, (he thinking they
were some of the rebels coming to lay down
their arms) and took ten pieces of cannon.
"" Cornwallis, the lord lisutenant of Ireland,

of August. No news of an engagement
had arrived at Cork on the Bth of Septem
ber, when the fleet failed
" The French were beating up for men
E publicly in some of the small towns.

â¢' TfE r
THE Subfcribcr prematurely borne
fonvard to a Ctuation of high refpon- l '
hopes the candour and con
sideration of his friends, not dwelling on
the errors and wanderings of his career,
will find for them an apology in the ?
heat and Inexperience of Youth. It
hath pleased Heaven to put a period to
the labours of him who had for ten
years conducted tp.publie admiration, the "
Gazette of the United States. Aw a- '
kened from mental diftreis, at the afflict- '
ing bereavement, his fuccdfor feels hiin
felf overcome in the consideration of the v
weighty task which has devolved on him:
He is but too conscious that he (lands v
in " the breach the angry angel made," c
only to render it the more conspicuous;
a breach, alas ! not soon to be filled, i
Notwithstanding the flattering opinions
of friendlhip, which ever watchful for' '
indications on which to ground the' t
mast favourable preciiftions, often ere- 1
ates them by the mere force of imagina- '
tion, he is fearful that his friends wjll
with more difficulty distinguish the mens â¢
abnormis fapiens y craffaque Alitierva, than t
| tke unattempered fire and indifctetion of '
' youthful inexperience :To them and . '
the Publicj however he pledges the best' (
exeftions of that portion of judgment, :
and of talents, which nature has allotted 1
him : For the reftitude of his intentions,! '
he can with confidence make an high
appeal. Immerging to active life, at a
period big with events of immense mag
nitudeâa period at which the world
seems trembling on a point,âon the
mighty turn of which rests happiness or
woe, it will be his highest aim to strength
en the existing barriers round the pub
lic weal, and to contribute in railing
new pillars to the decaying edific? of
public virtue.
It may be of some interest to those
who look for a continuance of entertain
ment and information through the me
dium of this Gazette, to learn the lead
ing features by which it is proposed to
distinguish the publicationOn this
head the Subscriber thinks fit to be
brief 5 and here happily he reflects with
pleasure that his cpurfe is already so plain
ly marked out for him, as*to leave little
to be said, and few new fields to be ex
plored.' ; '-***â¢'- " r ' ' l
It was his happy lot to be blefled with
parents exemplary in their lives, and
in their end. Hence Is derived the
fwecteft consolation for their loss. It
was their fortune while living to con
tract the esteem of that part of man
kind whose good opinion is mod valu
ble. Hence naturally resulted the fincer
eft sensibility at that dispensation which
removed them to a brighter world. Of
them molt truly may it be faidâMul
tis ill't bonis flebilis occiderunt.
To point out the cause of this esti
mation, is to illustrate the precise objeft
of his highest ambition. That line of
conduct vi'hich has been found, after a
long course of experience to have con
tracted general admiration and applause,
could not be deviated from without in
curring the just charge of ralhnefs.
And this brings him to state, âThat his
constant endeavor will be to conduct this
paper in such manner, (particularly in re
gard to the leading principles of its poli
tics) as to leave the reader as little sensi
ble as poflible, that it has palled into
new hands.
He leave to offer the most heart
felt gratitude for the generous counte
nance and support he has received, and
the most lively and ever-living recollec
tion of the private friendlhip he has ex
perienced ; hoping to bring about the
time when, more than at prefect, he may
be able to derive that in some degree
from personal mtrit, which now he at
tributes to a kind refpedt and esteem
for the virtues of a departed parent.

Citizen Wolf has communed with citizen
Tyger on the profpeft of a final privation of
the fattening fpoili of privateering on the
American commerce ; the refolt is a re
port of the relaxation of the Dire&ory in,
their unparalleled career of baseness towards
this country, by the lufpenfion of a recently
imposed embargo. The charafters of the two
correspondents are such, that it is presumed
a iran would not be accqfed of indelicacy for
doubting their veracity. Buta more impor
tant circumdance arrefls attention in thisbufi
cefs. At the date of S's letter,there had been
ample time for the arrival of the envoy
Logan. The objeft of his million, and his
inftru&ions from the Jacobinic Divan, seem
pretty generally uaderftood to have been
grounded on the eipe&ation of retraining
the Direftory, as far as poflible, from preÂ£
sing matters to extremities by intemperate
violence. Let yonr fraternal hugs be more
gentle, fays Logan* and they will again
1 bend to your pressure. As the Direftory
â¢ have taken every important movement hither
. to agreeably to the advice and direftion of
their servants the faftion here, it was not to
1 beixpefted that this lad admonition (which
' was deemed of fttffi ient importance to au

fail to meet equally prompt and Â»mpli<. it at
