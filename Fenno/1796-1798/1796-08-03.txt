When parties exist, as they ever will in 'a free

true eharafter and real'objefts. The anarchists,
anti-fedeialiftt, Jaeobins, and democrats of our
country (/or all these najres hate been deemed ap- ]
plicable) fay and swear in there modest way, that 1
; they alone are friend* of liberty. They are the ex
cluftve patriate, the friends of French liberty, and
of course the friends of American liberty. Fads,
ftuhhorn facts, destroy the pretty web of felf praise.
The clubbift*. the Jacobins, the democrat* (call
them as you please) for they arc all scurvy names,
have been the great enemies of French liberty. If
liberty (hould finally fail in that country it will be
owing to these vermin. In like manner if liberty,
fhoultl die a sudden and violent death in the United
State*, it is these affaflins, these blood-drinker* who
will destroy it. In this country, at in France, the
genuine friend* of liberty, the leal patriot* are the
Jriends of Government /

THE H-iufeof Rerefentatives (that is the then
maj rity) would not vote that their confidenee in
the President was undiminished, because his con
dud refpefting the British Treaty had in fact di
minished it. Party at that day seemed to be puffed
up with the felf importance of the task of align
ing to the President, the exact measure of confi
de! ce he was believed to have left. A member from
Virginia, and one from New York, avpwed their
Tefpeft for him (and in the imaginary fullnefs of
their power it was a kind thing in those rwTuous
gentlemen to profefs any) but they said it was /(ft
than formerly. How this world must have been
tuta'd topfy survey beforefich men (but 1 leave it
to their intimate! to draw their characters) could
find occasion \o give, or take away the praise of

Whether the people place an undimini/heJ fconfi
dence in the men who pretended to have, some half,
f me two thirds, and other* only a tenth of their
fiiimrr confidence in the President, the next elec
tion will shew. Unlcf6 the people change in a man

beyond every other renders impoflible, the innova

men who have been in the habit of breaking their
own private faith and who naturally trifled with that

the praflire of the virtues of private jife shall have
recovered or created confidence in thcmfelvci, they
may begin again, and with rather more propriety,
to talk of its being withdrawn from the P'cfident.

c Wiffem against Roberts.
" This was an action of affumpfit against the
" defendant, as the Drawer of a Bill of Ex
" change.â
1 Plea of the general Iffiie.
iÂ» " The bill was drawn by one Roberts in favor
- " of Thomas Ould or order, on Thomas Yates,
-Â«' fo,/\ 86. dated Ift November, 1793, payable
J " three months after date. Yates accepted it,
1- " but did not pay it, and the defendant was there,
i- Â« fore sued as drawer, on his default.
a " The defence on the merits was, that the
r Â»Â«â¢ plaintiff, the indorsee, knew that the 1 .ill was
f " an accommodation one, between Yates and the
I " defendant, and besides, had not paid the value
r s " for it. The fiift witnefscalled for the plaintiff,
II Â« on his cross examination proved, that the bill was
t " really an accommodation bill, and that it was
d Â«' known by the plaintiff to be so, and that he in
if " fad had given for i( but 29.
" Lord Kenyan said, that where a hill of Ex
- " change, is given for money really due, from the
f, " drawee to the drawer, or is drawn in the regular
r " courle of bufuiefs, in such cafe, the indorsee)
â - " though he has not given to the indorfer the.full

1- " he has really pai"B, to the use of the but
e " where the bill is an accommodation one, and
r <â¢ that known to the indorsee, and he pays but part
it " of the amount, in such cafe, he can only recover
n â < the sum he has actually paid for the bill ; and if
e " the plaintiff in this cafe was entitled to recover,
y " he could only do it to the amount of the

MeJJieurs Powers & Seymour, 1
BY the help of your neat type, let me requefl 1
the citizens of Savannah to look about them. 1
I have often heard old people speak of a book j
whieh had been much read in the days of our ,
grand fathers. The volume is almost ohffolete now
âbut several of its ftpries have been taken out,
and by the aid of tradition, kept alive to this day.
Among these stories, there was one often told
us when wÂ« were children, conceraing a city of
very antient times, which had been funk in the
dead sea, for the wickedness of its inhabitants.
There it one part of this story, which I believe J
' shall never forget, " That before those bad nien ;j
had been finally abandoned to dcftr(Rftion, G'o<r
Almighty had proposed to spare the whole of
them, on condition they produce ten
righteous perfoÃS, belonging to the city. That
not being able to raise that numbed thef were
consigned to sudden perdition, by" a fearful earth
quake ; and not a foul but three were exempt from
the general ruin. One man and h's two daugh
ters were wife enough to believe what was threat
! enedâtook warning in time, and made their
; escape." Â°
| The people of modern cities <4hould loot about j,
. themâthey k*<ow not the dajyior tfoe hoor, 'fchen
the ground beneath torn afWider by j
convulsions; the flreet whffdfTlrey live turned to q
a noiforae lake, or a hideous cavern 1 or the whole n
city metamorphosed into a dreads"l sea, like that p
of Sodom and Gomorrah. For those bad men the
story speaks of, were not the only wretches whom F
the pit has swallowed up alive. Many other
have met the fame catastrophe, in much later times. e
Read the Portuguese annals of '55, and lean) â¢ the t
melancholy tale of Lisbon. Peruse the Spanish
chronicles of '72, and note the subversion of'Gua- Â«
timala ; then turn to the memorable events of the c
two Sicilies in '83, and you will find a tragical ac
count indeed, of no less than 80 or 100 tflwns aqd *
villages, with 40,000 inhabitants, all loft ,
redemption, by an earthquake so powerful and ex- j
tensive, as to throw the whole province of Cala- r
bria under the ocean. i:
However (earthquakes and tornadoes out of the 1
qiieftion) there are many other means, by which
: jull heaven feourges unhallowed cities. Uncon- r
querable fires melt dpwn their buildings, and give [
wings to their riches to fly away. A subtile pe r
t Atlencc, sweeps off its hundreds and its thousands, c
as with the besom of deftrufUon. These sublime
judgments of heaven have long been the terror of
, the old world. They have at length found their
way to the new. Let all the people of the new f
, world look about themâhold themselves in readiness f
for these great scenes ef public dismay â for a time f
when an earthquake may furprifr themâfor a time f
when their cities or houses may be enveloped with 1
devouring flames over their heads, or when a letht- <
serous fever may carry off scores of their fellow- 1
r citizens in a day. c

Ejttradl of a letter from Infpruck (in Germany)

Wtliin a few weeks past the Tirol has been the route
of the troops from Germany and Auflria, fcr the re
inforcement of tjje army in Italy ; they were much a
stonished to meet there the fad remains of that army,
with -whom they expedted ttt (hare the-ir laurels, total.
ly,difperfed, without any order: these movementi, e
qially unexpected as extraordinary, have created a
mod vivid sensation in the minds of the inhabitants, a
part of whom did not credit the defeat of Beaulieu.
recruiting for men to dra* the field
pieces, is continued with the fame spirit â  each man
receives from 50 to 60 florins (German ). They are
' aboutjentrufting them with murdering air-guns, invent
ed in the reign of Jo eph 11. which he made use of with
the greateit success, in the last war against the Turks.
This carabine, lighter and smaller than tfie common
ones, iscompofedof two barrels, the smallest of which
contains aj balls ; and by a flight movement, they pass
from one to the other, into a receptacle made for them;
which ball, by lowering the firelock, goes off with
the fame rapidity and carries further than if fired with
powder, without the leaf! noise, and that as often as a
hundred times alternately, during the space of g or 19
minutes ; after which, the reservoir being exhausted,
it requires to pump in trelh air, which takes up at moll
16 minutes.
Count Louis Stahremberg, Minister from his Impe
rial majesty, at the court of St.JamesY, prefenred the
prince of Wales with one of those carabines, of the
benefit of which the English may avail themselves, and
make use of them in the Indies well as atfea; the
damp weather never putting them out of order.
OSSENBACH, May 16.
We wait an opening close to the country ; it il
said that the Count de Colloredo, on his return
flom Vienna on the 10th inft. has brought dispatch
es of aa important nature, which may occasion a
great alteration in the political fylltm of affairs.
After his arrival at Mayence, the Arch Duke
Charles repaired to Manheim, to hold a conference
with the Marshal de Wurmfer. Belidcs which,
orders were immediately given to form Abatis's
from DonnÂ»rfourj>, by Hochfpeyer, as far as Edig
hoveu. The Chancery at War, the CommifTary
Department, the Magazines and Troops, which
were found in the Cirele of Franconia, have ail re
ceived orders to join the army.
On the 9th, ticar2oo troops from the frontiers
palled to Afchaflenbourg. These troops having
been made prisoners of war by the French, remain
ed in th* diltridt of Franconia, expedting they might
serve again ; the time fixed upon in the capitulati
on, beirg expired, they are now going to rejoin
, the army. Various ideas are conjedturedâlt is
thought the Imperial troops will abandon the siege,
and retire to the Mountains near Neuwied. â

o'clock, A. M. all the dijNfions wero in motion,
directing their march towards Borghetto, where I H
had determined to cross the Minico. The enemy s

of I,Boo'hotfe, defended the approach of Borgh

followed by our carabineers and grenadiers, charg

artillery. The enemy then ctoffed the bridge, de- w
rnolilhkig one of its arches. The light artillery n<
immediately engaged. We were endeavoring with c
much difficulty to mend it ur.der the fire of the
enemy's batteries, when about 50 grenadier., with g
General Gardenne, a grenadier in height, as well Â«
a 9 courage, at their head, threw themselves .n-the b

their muflce.s over their heads. The enemy, be_ n

passed the Mincio, and possessed themselves of Va-

partly roamed, were drawn up in order of battle, J
between Valeggio and Villa Franca, but we took <

lowing the bank, of this river, and cut off the pafe
off the Tyrol from the enemy. Beiuhea and the

3re held by the President and two Directors of the Bank

By accounts received from the different parts of the
