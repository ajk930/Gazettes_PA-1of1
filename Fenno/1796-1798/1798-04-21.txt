â¢who told me he inerv nothing of the note ; I never learnt
inhere it â¢was until my return to the city, when a series of
unparalleled misfortunes had rendered rae incapable <f
discharging my jufl debts : I called on Mr. Priejlman, as
ivell as my other creditors, and offered to pay ihtm Ly an
order for retaining a. portion of my yearly salary until
they tvere paid, convincing them that this was my only
r/Source, and produced protefied paper (ivhich tuas, when

I n'hicb tuas abandoned by Mr. Prifflwan only, to the un

PHILADELPHIA,
SATURDAY EVENING, April 11.
Yeflerday, the House of Representatives of
the United States again went into a committee
ot' the whole on the (late of the union, on the
b 11 to provide an additional armament for the
further protection of the trade of the United
States ; when the consideration of Mr. Gal
latin's amendment for confining the life of
the vessels, being resumed, after a long de
bate, which protraCted the fitting till nearly
eight o'clock at night (from a determination
of a majority ofthe house to take the queflion
before they rose) the question was taken and
negatived 49 to 34. The committee rose,
and after taking a queflion upon the amend
ment for flriking out sixteen vessels to insert
twelve, by yeas and nays, which was carried
4-5 t0 37.and alio upon Mr. Gallatin's amend
ment, which was renewed in the house, and
negatived 50 to 31, the bill was ordered to be
reaJ a third time on Monday, to which day
the house adjourned.
The Speaker not being able to attend the
house, from indisposition, a motion was made
by Mr. Sr rague, and carried, for the ap
pointment of a Speaker pro tem. The house ac
cordingly ballotted for a temporary Speaker,
when the votes were as follow ; for Mr. Dent,
40, Mr. Sitgreaves 19, Mr. Baldwin 11, Mr.
J. Williams 1 and Mr. Blount 1. âMr. Dent
wasofcourfe declared elected and took the

of respeCt to him, by attending his remains to
the German Lutheran Church of St. Michael,
where a funeral discourse was delivered by
the Rev. Mr. Smith. Amongfl the number
of refpetlable citizens who fuelled the long

The British treaty and the President's speech,
as we hare seen, are the avowed reafans for
which paci'.ication is impeded, and for which
warlike deprecations, are committed. Writers
on the law of nations difcrlminate between the
reasons given, and the real motives for hostili
ties. Every nation going to war, offers some
juflificatory plea ; btit the motives are often ve
ry different. The treaty and the speech are the
juflificatory excul'ts of France; but I cannot
copjeilureany feafonahle motive they can have.
Js it reafoaablethat any nation would lavish her
tres'ure when she is poor already ?. that she
would fail the blood of her foldlcrs wben she
has !â¢ ft a million in fix years by fighting ; and
all this, to obhia fatisfadtion for a treaty which
does rxt affect her ; Â«i for a speech which was
a jail exposition of her
ptciall), car.nrt be a valid cause of quarrel, for
their unfriendly disposition was manifefted be
fore the promulgation of the speech.
To render any offenfive adls of heftility equi
table, the jollification and the motive should
b t'n appear " decent and commendab'e." How
rommendable is the j iflif.cation of France ?
Why, as much fj, as those of Alexander to Da
riusâor ofthe Romans for thefecond Punic war.
Like thtii modÂ«l the Reman.republic, the
French motives are unjuflâlike them, the latter
are the plunderers of the world ; like them,
conquest, falfe glory, ambition and dominion,
ire their dffiderata magnata. Their judica
tion dwindles into a pretext for the gratifica
tion of these unlawful motives.
Supposing for argument only, that France had
a reafonsble cause : their motive could not he
good, in commencing war, for no real advan
tage could be gained by it. If a quarrel should
always succeed a right to quarrel, we should
have been involved long ago. llow then can
France b: defended, when Uwth a commendable
plea, and. a just, or even a politic motive are
wanting ?
Having hitherto spoken of the French, as be
ing at Â« ar with America, on their part, it will
be nccrffary to prove the faft. " War" (fays
Vattel page 437.) " is that state in which a na
tion prosecutes its right by force." This defi
nition is general; and we may suppose that a na
tion prcfecuting any thing wrong, by force, is
war. Again, (Vatt. p. 439) Â»â¢ He (speaking of
afovereign) who takes up arms and attacks a
nation that lived in peice with bim makes an
offenfive war." Nothing is neceffarj to prove
that France has done this.
Lxcufes are often given, that the offending
individuals arc unauthorized to commit these
spoliations. But if application is made to that
nation, whose citizens nave violated our tran
quility, and no order for recompence or restitu
tion ran be procured, the nation takes the bur
den of the crime from the citizen. The calm
and delightful scene of peace is (hoved by, and
that*of war introduced.
At this moment, our commifTioueri are fcli
citii.g an audience of the French Republic: un
precedented preliminary conditions to a hearing
are required : the captures ftiil fandior.ed, and
new laws enabled for the deOruftion of more
vefiel*âAnd we may expcdl that decree'.pon
decree, will eventually produce the annihilation
of our commerce.
This war game is played dexterously ; for
while their mibi&crallures ouri, of the aSeflion
of France for America, the dire&ory and both
legislative houses pal's laws more and mure ini
mical to u>. This it like killing our lips,, and
kicking our Ihins at the fame time.

MR. FFNNO,
When I fiill knew that the Prsfident pave
up the lite difpatehes from France, I was both
surprized and displeased. But after I found
that he ha<i given up his inflruflions alfs, I Was
inoenfed against himâBut fin e that, on mature
rcfledtion, and finding that giving up the whole
has had so goofl an effcdl, I am fatiafied it was
proper ; the situation of our country required
it. Our late President would not accede to
give up the inftru&ions to Mr, Jayâl conftft
the cases are not exadlly similarâl
always thought he did right, from tht reasons
he gave. Faflion, that bane of all republican
government*, and which fcems to prevail in a
very uncommon degree in this age of the world,
calli to tny mind what Mr. Ponfonby, a cele
brated member of the Irish house of commvns,
fiid some years agoâ" I dislike (fiyshe) re
publican principlesâl deleft republics, because
from all the knowledge I have been able to
acquire of the ancient republics, and that which
I have of existing republics of Europe, 1 am lat
isfied they are governments unfavourable to ra
tional liberty." I hope it will net be the cafe
with our government and country, where I trud

The following was sent to the Editor of the

MR. BACHI,
See-ng in your paper ofTuefday 17th inft.
that " one signature hid been obtained to the ad
dress of the citizens to the Prefi lent, See. by a
misconception of its objedl and contents and
that the signer did or wished to era fe his
name," >t was spoken of as matter of conver
sation in presence of several |;eifans, who con
ftdering the tendency of Â£uch publications, at a
moment when unanimity only can avert the
Jlorm, and preparation pre/erve us from it, some
of them cilled at yÂ®ur office to enquire into the
faift ; they were desired in writing to "apply
to John Miller, near the Mcthodift meeting in
Fourth flreet," whither they went, and hiving
met him in his own tavern, were informed, that
" his young man a blacksmith, who came from
Scotland, had been in a (lore when theaddrefs
waÂ° presented and was aflted to sign 'it, which
be did; but on his tellir.g him (Mr-M.) and
others he had done so, they told him he was de
ceived, Isfc. upon which he fa d he would with
draw His name."
This affair being thus candidly dated, the
public and the world are to judge of what con
sequence it is that a man shall sign an address,
who does not know its purport ? And that upon
a fubjedl the theme of public, and universal pri
vate conversation at the time ?

Mr. Solomon May's barn, in Roxbury,
happened to be burnt by a lighted pipe !
If all the mifchief, that has happened by
lighted fegars, were put into one column,
and all the good they have done, by procu
ring to stupid people the enjoyment of some
additional half hours of stupidity, (which
is all that is ever said in their praise) were
put into another column, which, on a fair
calculation, would be the greater sum ? By
fmoaking tobacc9, houses and barns are in
danger of being burnt; and many are de
stroyed in confcquence.
By keeping dogs, the flocks of (heep are
ltflened one half, many children's lives have
been loft, and more are exposed.
Now which of the virtues that adorn life
which of the duties that sustain it, costs so
much as either before mentioned ? It costs
more for tobacco, 'than for charity and
knowledge. More has been fpeot in the
United States to feed dogs, than to teach
children!â Yet this is the boasted age of
reason and reformation.

spars, scantling, boards, staves and ftiinglet,
of which three belonging to the above gen
tleman, had palled down the river and got
to Havte de Grace on Sunday last, nine o'
clock.
The greater part of the timber abovemen.
tioned is consigned to captain '1 hayer, and
he has given positive diredions, that al
under his management shall pass into the

gentleman concerned accompanied the rafts
from Wright's Ferry to the tide water, and
came through that distance in 7 hours. An

LONDON, March 1.
The directory has issued a proclamation,
addrefTed to the French, relative to the en
suing electionsâthe objeCt of which is, to
inspire all Frenchmen with a f:rvent love of
their country, to dishearten all factions, to
annul the EnglifV influence, to crush the
spirit of Royalifm, to maintain Liberty,
Equality and the Rights of Man, and to af
ford the people the most proper means for
exercifiug the rights of sovereignty. The
directory is at a lofa to conceive " hÂ©w it
happens, that at the end of eight years re
volution, and such brilliant successes, the in
terior of the country is not so secure as af
fairs are abroad, which it attributed to the
hydra of royalifm, constantly beaten down
and constantly regenerating,and to the choice
of the representatives who were proposed last
year and paid by the treacherous agents of
Blankenburgh and St. James's." The di
rectory cautions the French people to beware
of the fame 'snares in the ensuing electoral
afTemblies, and to avoid them by choosing
worthy deputies.
A letter from Calais, inferred in the Pa
ris papers, thus describes the late visit of
Buonaparte to that port : " It is not gene
ral Lafue, it is Buonaparte who has been
here, cloleted with our oldest sailors, infpeCt
lng all the maps, and conferring on the va
rious projeCts of a descent upon England,
which have been addrefTed. Our marines
on this coast are exercising themfelvesat de
barkation ; and we have seen in less than five
minutes, fifty gun-boats make good their
landing, with their cannon and carriages.â
Our guns are to be of the English calibre,
that whatever cannon or balls we may cap
ture on landing may be converted to use.
They talk of an Irish general called Napper
Tandy, who istocolleCt under his flandard
no less than thirty thousand United lrilhmen.
On the whole, the descent appears tous to
wear a serious afpeCt."

were at Oftend, the fame papers fav, ate
under orders to repair to Dunkirk withcut
delay, to join the expedition which in the
latter port is preparing against this coun
try.

By a decree of the direftory the minis
ter of has been sent to Brest to su
perintend the preparations for the invasion
of England ; he is said to be accompanied
by Buonaparte.
A letter from Brest, dated February 18
states, that the night before a squadron of
ships bad failed from that port for St. Do
mingo, and that as they had a fine north
wind, there was no doubt of their being ar
rived out of the line of the British cruizers
before morning.
Private letters from Italy, speak with
confidence of an arrangement by which
Rome is to be given to the Duke of Par
ma, who is to cede his present territories to
the Kiag of Sardinia ; who, in his turn, iÂ«
to pay the French for his acquisition, by
the cession to them of the Island of Sardi
nia. Others again represent the King of
Naples as likely to Receive a considerable
share of the spoils of the Ecclesiastical
States, in return for which, the French are
to be put in pofleffion of the Island of Si
cily. Whatever the French may give, that
they are bent upon taking all that they can
get, seems no wife unlikely ; and the ar
maments which they have fitted out in the
Mediterranean and tbe neighboring seas, are
probably destined to secure important acqui
sition s.
Lord Auckland was on Saturday sworn
into the office of Joint Post Master General.
The French look with confidence to a
fleet of more than one hundced ships of the
line before the month of July next. They
fay that they obtained sixteen ships of the
line at Venice, together with a n immenfc
arsenal of naval {tores ; they have fourteen
(hips of the line at Toulon, and the Spani
ards hare ten at Carthagena.âThere are
twentjr-five in the port of Cadiz, and thirty
at Brest, Rochefort, and other French ports
of the Ocean. They look for sixteen frem
the Dutch, and thus they number a very
formidable fleet on paper. How to man and
equip these ships is the desideratum. A ve
ry large body of seamen, both Fiench and
Dutch, are now prisoners in England, and
ministers will take very good care that no
exchange shall take place, by which the ar
mament of the enemy might be forwarded.
Thursday, Lieutenant BellÂ» of the ar
tillery, tried another experiment on tbe
Queen's battery, Portsmouth, with a piece
or ordnance, which fully aefwered every
expectation formed of it, and will bÂ« of
â¢ great public utility. In cafe a ship is strand
ed 011 rock 3, tec. some distance from the
shore, to throw a rope, and the sea running
too high for people to get ofF to their affifU
a nee, then they are to have an iron ball with
a ring bolt, in which is fattened a line of fuf
ficient length to reach tbe shore, and being

bear a very great weight before it can be '

principal officers there were a great num

CHARGE OF TREASON.
Saturday morning early three peace offi
cers arrived at the residence of Sladden,
Esq. mayor of Folkftone, and informed him
they were in pursuit of a Foreigner, who
had been a short time resident with a filher
man in that town. The mayor attended
them to the house, which was examined;
but the party was not found. One of the
officers then said to the fifherman, you have
three mahogany boxes. These the man
pointed out lying in the window ; and on
being opened, they contained tea, kc. but
one of them having three letters with fo
reign dire&ions these was taken poÃcflion of
by the mayor. About ten o'clock the fame
morning the mayor, accompanied by Mr.
T. Baker and Mr. Stridwick, who are also
magistrates made some farther enquiry, and
found that the person had certainly boarded
with the fifherman, but had slept at Folk
ftone Arms Inn, from which he had depar
ted early i.i the morning, on observing the
confufion occaiioned by this search. The
filherman being upbraided for his dupl.'city,
confefTed that the person had set out on foot
for Afhfoi'd. The three gentlemen pursued
on horseback to Sandgate castle, where they
found the person had departed in a chaise
for Canterbury. They proceeded thither
with the utmott dispatch, and called upon
Mr. Alderman Brittow, who accompanied
them to the Fountain inn, where, enquiry
being made, it was found that the person
had changed horses at the Red-Lion tavern,
and proceeded on his route for London near
ly two hours before. The magistrate, upon
this sent for Colonel Cottereli, of the He
reford regiment, the then commanding offi
cer in that'city, who instantly dispatched
some orderly dragoons, and lieut. Marsh, of
the Hereford regiment, in purfuir. On his
approaching Rochester, the person got out,
and sent the chaise forwards ; but the dra
goons and officer arriving in the interim, a
hue and cry was raised, and he was taken
when just entering the back part of one of
the inns. He then underwent an examina
tion before R. Thompson, esq. Mayor of
Rochester, who sent him, under a proper
escort to town.
After the departure of the military in
pursuit, Mr. Alderman Briftow took a pro
per disposition from the mayor of Folkftone,
and the fame was dispatched, with the three
letters found in one of the boxes, by express
to the duke duke of Portlaud. The pri
soner reached town on Saturday, and is now
in custody at the Parliament street coffee
houfe.
Much praise is certainly due to the may
or and magistrates of Folkftone for their
great and persevering activity which led to
the apprehension.
It since appears that the captain of a ves
sel in Dover harbour (who is said to be in
custody) had accepted a large bribe to take
him over and that the fifherman was to have
carried him on board the veflel, which was
to fail to Folkftone roads for that pjrpofe.
Saturday Mr. O'Connor, and the others
implicated with him in a charge of high trea
son, were again examined before Mr. Pitt,
Mr. Dundas, the duke of Portland, the
lord Chancellor, the attorney and solicitor
generals, lord Liverpool, master of the Rolls
fir Wm. Wynne, Lord Chatham, and some
others, at the duke of Portland's office.
Favey, alias Captain Jones, alias Colonel
Morris, was the firft called in and under
went an examination which lasted about
three quarters of an hour ; during which
it is stated, he avoided any further commu
nication than he had made at Margate. Mr.
O'Connor, was twice examined, his answers
we are giventounderftand, werefcrupuloufly
reserved and inconclusiveâhas stay before
the Council did not, at either time, exceed
the space of five minutes. Alley and Leary
likewise underwent a short examination ;
Binns, persisting in his determination not to
answer any interrogatories, was not called
for.
At three o'clock the council broke up,
when Mr. Favey was ordered into the custo
dy of Sylrefter, the Mefienger ; Mr. O'-
Connor to the care of Seott; B.'nns to thkt
of Mason ; Leary, to East, and Alley to
Fabiani's charge.
Mr. O'Conner appeared less deprefTed
than he had been on his firft examination j
and Favey seemed highly confident.
The mahogany boxes, part of the bag
gage of the prisoners, and in which their pa
pers were depoflted, were of fmgular forma
tion, having at the bottom and fides fevcr
al cencealed drawers for the secretion of pa
persâin other refpefts they resembled me
dicine chests, and the locks were of such
excellence, that no key or pick could be
fofind to open them, and the boxes were
nearly broken to pieces in order to attain
their contents.

RASTADT, February 10.
The following is the declaration of the
Prussian Minitters refpeÂ£ting the cefiion of
thÂ« left bank of the Rhine :
" The undersigned plenipotentiaries of
iis majesty the king ef Prussia, at the COll
- at Raftadt, do not hesitate to declare,
in the name of their high constituent, that
his majesty has for feveial years zealously en
deavored to obtain for Germany a peace as'
favorable as circumstances will allow ; his
majefly (l ill entertains the fame ardent wiffi ;
be is also of opinion that this peace cannot
be too soon accelerated, not only because
it "will relieve several parts of Germany of
the expences of the war, by which they
are exhjulied ; but also it will secure the
yhole empire against the difallrous and ih
calculable consequences with which it is
threatened by the continuation of the pre
sent (lateof things.
Considering that according to the nego
tiations which have taken place between the
deputation of the empire and the French
embafiy. it might happen, that in order to
attain a peace so earnestly desired by the na
tion, and so for humanity, the de
putation of the emperor and of the empire
might think uecedary to accede to the hafis
of p'tace proposed by Fiance, namely the
eeffion of the left bank of the Rhine, the
linderfigned Plenipotentiaries declare, in the
name of his majesty, aÂ« Co-State of the
empire, that notwilhllabding hiÂ» paternal
feelings are severely hurt by the loss of fub
jeÂ£U whojnanifeft so faithful an attachment
to him, it is not his intention to make an ex
ception with refpeft to his dominions fi'u
ated on this fide : but that by the eeffion
thereof, he will make a facrifice to the pub
lic welfare and the restoration of peace, tak
ing, however, as much as toffible the ne
cessary measures of precaution tot the hap
piness and fafety of the property of the in
habitant*, and on condition that his majesty
receives a jull and equivalent indemnification

The Address and Memorial of the citizens
of Baltimore and Baltimore county. j
Refpeclfully Jbeweth,
THAT your memorialists at this impor- 1
tant and eventful crisis, when a foreign na- i
tion equally regardlef of the faith of trea- '
ties and tb; law of nations, has menaced '
with deftruftion the freedom and indepen
dence of the United States, and represent- :
ed the citizens thereof to be a divided peo- â¢
pie, feel themselves impelled by confidera- 1
tions as duty and love to their corntry, to '
express their sentiments and declare their
determination to support the constituted
authorities.
Your memorialists highly applaud thewife
and liberal measures pursued by the govern
ment of the United States for the adjust
ment of all differences, and restoration of
harmony between this country and the
French republic ; measures which, in their
opinion, had for their objeA the preservation
as peace, the faith of treaties and the wel
fare of the United States. It is with regret
we learn that these advances to peace have
! been wantonly rejedted, and our envoys not
j only denied an audience, but treated with
; the mod marked contempt. A condnft.
j like this fails not to excite a spirit of indig
! nationâand although warmly attached to
! peace and its consequent blessings, we can
| not for a moment hesitate in making our e
leftion between freedom and servile submis
sion to a foreign power.
Having the fulleft confidence in the wis
dom of our government, we submit to their
consideration, the neceflity of placing our
country in a state of defence, and protcÂ£t
ing its commerce; and trull, that in the
adoption of such measures as found policy
may di&ate, the considerations of expense
and temporary inconveniences refuhiagfrom
the interruption of peace, will not be con
sidered of such msgnitude as to bfc placed in
competition with the foveriegnty and free
dom of the United States, whose exist
ence are so urijuftly threatened. â

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Monda ?, April ifi.
MR. REKO presented .a petirion from the
inhabitants of Randolph, in the (tate of
Massachusetts, praying that merchauts may
not be permitted to arm their vellefs, and that
no measures may be tak?n which will lead to j
a rupture with France, as they wi/h to avoid
war with all countries.
Mr. Otis prefeuted a petition from Dor
cheller, in the fame (late, to the like eft'eil.
Mr. Livingston presented two petitions,
one from Acquacknonk, inEfTex county, <(nd
the other from another town in the fame coun
ty, in the (late of New-Jersey, to the fame
purpose.
Mr. Gallatin presented a similar petiti
on from,Morri flown, in New-Jersey.
The Speaker also laid before the House a
petition of the lame nature, from Newark, in
New-Jersey.
Mr. Dawson said, he had received some
resolutiOns which had been paired at a meet
ing of freeholders and others, of Spotfylva
nia, in Virginia, which he was requested to lay
before the House. He presented them, and
they were read accordingly. They were de
claratory of a desire for a continuance of peace,
and againfl the measure of arming merchants' I
velTels, and all other measures which may
have a tendency to involve the country in
war, and deprecating any connection with
England.
Mr. New also laid before the House some
refolutisns of Â» similar kind, patted at a nu
merous meeting of the citizens of Richmond,
in Virginia (which had been inclosed to him
by his colleague, Mr. Clopton, who is absent
011 leave).
The above petitions and refblu'ions were
referred to the committee of the"whole on the
(late of the Union.
Mr. Josiah Parked asked and obtained
leave of absence for his colleague, Mr. Ca
bell, for the remainder of the fellion. Mr.
Harrison did the fame for Mr. Giles, on
account of the bad (late of his health. Mr.
SpÃrcc also obtained leave of absence for
his colleague, Mr. Baer, for eight days, and
Mr. Harper for Mr. Bayard for one week.
Mr. Foster, from the committee of
claims, made a report on the petition of Jo
nathan Hafkel, recommending an agreement
to the report of the Secretary of War on the
cafe, which goes to authorize the accounting
officers to fettle his account. ââ¢Committed for
to-morrow.
Mr. Sew all moved that the House go in
to a committee of the whole on the (late of the
Union, in order to take up the bill providing
an additional regiment ot Artillery and En
gineers.
The House resolved itfelf into a commit
tee of the whole accordingly, and the bill ha
ving been read,
Mr. Sew all moved to fill the blank left
for the period for which men should be enlist
ed, with five years.
Mr. Nicholas had no idea we should
have occasion for these men for five years.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker} said, they
might be wanted for five years. If they were
there would be a considerable saving inenlift
ing them for that time, as men would as rea
dily be got for that period as for shorter.
Mr. Nicholas was unwilling that the
men should be enlisted for so long a period,
and if no one else did it, he (hould move a li
mitation c'.aiife to the bill.
Mr. Lyon did not think citizens would be
fond of enlisting for five years; he thought
three years long enough.
Mr. Gallatin called for the reading of
the aft, which direffts that men Thalt be en-* -
lifted for five years, as he fojjnd in the origin
al law they were to be engaged, only for three
years. [The law of was accordingly
read.]
Mr. Sewall wiflied the words in thiscafe
to be the fame as in "the former law, viz. " for
five years, unless sooner discharged.'.' -
The question was put and carried, there be
ing 60 votes for it.
i Mr. Sewall moved to fill the blank for
the number of battalions with three, as he.
believed three would be furffitient.
Mr. J. Williams thoughrtvvo additional
battalions would be fufficient, as that would
â  make in the whole 24. companies, or 148.8*
â  men, and in that cafe another Lieut. Co'lonel
1 Commandant might be had.
The question, for three battalions was. put
( and carried, 47 to 3a.
The bill being gorie through,
Mr. Gallatin said, he wilhed to move an
' amendment in the firfl feilion. In the,year
- 1792, when the law was parted for railing three
, regimentsof Infantry, two provisions were in
serted in itto prevent their being kept longer
in service than the occasion for which they
' were engaged required. The firll was, " Pro
vided that the said three regiments shall be
' discharged so soon as the United States shall
f beat peace with the Indian Tribes." The
other provision gave to the President a povv
" er to forbear the enlisting of men, and of dis
charging them Whenever, in his opinion, the
, state of tilings ceased to make them neceflary.
In order to effe<il the fame purpose which
these provisions had in view, viz. adifcharge
of the men when the occasion which calls
them into exigence ceases to exist, he propo
sed the following amendment, " Provided
that the laid regiment shall be discharged, as
soon as the differences now exilfing between
the United States and the French Republic,
flull have been adjusted." Those gentlemen
who wished this regiment to be made a part
of our permanent establishment, would of
course vote against this amendment ; but
those who wished it to cease when the present
alarm ceases, will certainly vote in favour of
it.
Mr. Hap.tley did not think it would be
i right to agree to this amendment; for if we
were to be involved in war, it might not be
f with one nation only. He should be willing
to agree to the latter proVision which his col
league had mentioned, viz. that the President
shall forbear to raise men, ordifcharge them,
when he thinks proper. He saw no reason for
being so pointed, as we had not at present de
clared war against the French Republic.
Mr. Skw.ALL thought this amendment
pointed and improper. The gentleman from
. I'ennfylvania would not have Congress fay,
- thaf these men were raised to act against the
i French Republic. If the French were to at
' tack us, they would to be sure be employed
* against them. But this amendment supposed
' the end of a state of things which' is not yet
hegnn. He had no objeflion_ to adopt the
-provision which the gentleman last up had
mentioned.
' Mr. S. Smith said, he should be candid
with tile gentleman from Penufylvania. He
meant to vote for this corps, umier the idea of
its being a permanent corps. The House had
i voted 250,000 dollars'fdr the purpose of eretl
ing and foipplctin); fortifications, in which it
â¢ would, hp to kuep a Jufhcicnt tulinbcr
of men, which he believed would require
of the men now contemplated, in addi
tion(3 rfcofe already in exigence. At Boflon,
ho ford, where there art none itt present, one
company will be wanted; at Rhcde-Illaiid,
New-York and Mnd-!fland, each an additi
onal company ; at Ocr icock, in North-Caro
lina; at Old Point Comforr, in Virginia; and
at three for's on the Mifliflippi, enrh a com
pany. He should therefore vo'e for th^sregi
ment tinder a profpefl of its being a perma
nent corp*. It was a corps which would re
quire men of education as officersâand what i
inducement, he alked, would there be for
men of this description to enter into it, ifthey
were liable to be discharged from the lervice
at the end of lix months f
Mr. Nicholas hoped the amendment .
proposed would not be disagreed to upon the
ground stated by the gentleman last up,which
he thought a little singular. If the force .
CÂ»ntemplated, was adequate for a time of
war, the fdme could not be neceflary in time
of peace. The reason which would continue
in force this regiment after the occasion ceas
ed for which it was formed, would hold for
keeping up any ether force which it may be
found neceflary to raise. At a tiine when
measures are about to Be taken which will
call for all the resources which the country
can furnifh, they ought to look to a period
when they will have aner.d. He believed the
ex pence of a war, would be one of its greatefl
evils.
Mr-Dayton (aid, if the gentleman from
Virginia had (hewn that this additional regi
.ment would be fufficient in cafe of war, his
argument might have had lome weight ; but
not having (hewn this,norbeen able to (hew it,
his argument failed. He was not himfelf
prepared to fay that this regiment ought to be
a part of ourpermanent effablilhment,though
he believed some of the men at least would
be wanted to occupy the proposed new forti
fications, and the polls which we had receiv
ed from England and Spain. But he object
ed to the amendment particularly on this
ground, and it afionifhed him that a sentiment
of the kind (hould have corns from the quar
ter from which this came. If any thing in the
proceedings of our government could amount
to a declaration of hoftiliiy againfl France, it
would be found in this amendment. He hop
ed the committee would not agree to any pro
position which looked that way. Holtility
with that country was very probable; but
(hall we, said he, by a vote of this kind, de
clare that we are raising troops to be employ
ed holfilely again!! France f He trusted 110
such thing would be done.

PROPOSAL,
For Publifbing by Sulfcription,
an
E N I R Y
INTO THII
ORIGW OF EPIDEMIC DISEASES.
THE Letters to Dr. Currie, which I publi&ed
last autumn, led me to an invefligation of
the origin and phenomena of peftilsntial difcafes
in other countries as well as in the United St tes.
In the profircution of the fubjeil, new fails and
principles continually opened to Miy view, and fi
nally determined me to trice hack the hiftury of
such diseases as far as the records of hiflory ex
tend. For this purpefe, I haye examined the pub
lic libraries in New-York, New-Haven, Cam
bridge and Boston, with a viaw to obtain all the
material fails which can illustrate the fubjÂ»it,and
I have nearly colle&ed all the materials for the
proposed work.
The fails tallied will enable me to demon
ftratc that many of the common ideas refpe&ing
peftilentialepidemics, are unfounded or extreme
ly incorrc<9 ; and this ill confcqucr.ce of medical
writers considering an epidemic disease as a detach
ed or isolated phenomenon in a particular coun
try ; rather than as connected with other epide
mics or other phenomena of nature in various
parts of the world. The fails I have collcited
lead to certain deduitions which are surprising to
myfelf, and which will probably be new to many
others. Much light will bÂ« thiown on this dark
and perplexing fubjeil, at well as on natural phi
losophy.
The proposed work will make a full sized oila
vo volume ; and executed well on fine paper, can
not be afforded at leis than two dollars, bound,
wflh the ufoal allowance to book-feller-. At thÂ«
compilation will cost not only great laber.but con
siderable expcnce, no more copies will be printed
than to supply fufcfcribert. The book will be rea
dy for fubhribersearly iu the coming fummcr.and
thi holders of propofa'.s will be good tnough to
return them to No. 40, Pine-ftrect, by the firftof
May.

of Land, one half of which is under wood, the other
very fine arable Land, producing the best Hay and
Pasture. The Cannon lately manufactured there,

mar.ufafturc, and a place of arms lying in the date
of Connecticut, and only 30 miles from several land,
