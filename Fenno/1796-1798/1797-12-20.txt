New-Theatre,
December 11, 1797.
r T~ I HE Maucjils particularly rcqucfi. the coa
* JL currence of the public in the abolition of a
cuftoai, which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at ihe ap l
. Theatre. Â£
They are aware that gentlemen are unconscious
of any wrong done to tne interest qf the inllitu
(ion by thispraflicc, from a general, though naif-
taken idea that Checks arc the reprcfentatives of a
right to so many feats in tlhe Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainm&if, and transfer Â«ileat will;
when in fa<ft, they were never intended as more
than tottm by which the Door-keepers are enabled
to afcertaia with the h alt trouble to tjje fiarliu, thit ]
tity tbemfdms have been before in the Theatre?, or
paid for their admiflion. !
Independent of the injury the Managers sustain, 1
such a pra<slice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other difordej-ly persons to surround the dporj of
the Theatre, to the corruption of their morals and (
the great annoyance of tbe Audience. ~
It has also beÂ«n theCaiirce of two evih of no in- J C
confulcrable magnitude; one is, that fomctitncs
ver-y impropur cÂ«tnp,iny is by".these means admit- _
ted ; and the other, that to Checks pafling (
into difhonejl hands, they have be>n frequenaly ?T
counterfeited to a large amount for the purnofessf .
Sale.
This ftatenicnt will, it isrefpe<9fully hoped, in- lu ''
ducc the Public to discourage such a traffic : and
the exertions of the Managers will, if tbus afiidedi
easily prove adequate to its entire abolition. con

If none better are offered, please to pub

enquiries after " truth."
PAUL.
TO PILATE.
QUKlibn i. " Why is it that Dc'tfli fqmi
ti&es become Christians ?"
Aufwer. Because some Dei/is enlightened
and influenced by the divine spirit, perceive
and embrace thc^-uth.
Q. 2. " Why do the latter (i. e. Chrif
tiaqsj never change fides i"
A. Because theydo not choose to change
a good religion for none at all, or that which
yields them tortifort and hope, for that which
deprives them of both.
tiec'i'.-*' vr.jtariati} ?"
A. All trinitarians are unitariansâi. e.
Thev believe! there is but one God. Uni
fifru'tt, therefore, is not a proper term of
diftindtion. But tn ; adapt the answer to
your mftningâTHe-reafcri why fomc trini
ta'ri ir.s (or those who believe the dextrine of
Chri/i's divinity) become unitarians ; âviz.
deny awl rejedt the doctrine of Chri/l's Â£-
' vinity, i>:ay be, either because such trinita
rians have never been fettled and established
in this branch of icriptural faith, and are,
therefore, proper fubjedts to be borne about
b'y every wind cf dodtrine ; or, because
t iicv have profidly disdained to believe what
they could not comprehend and explain ;
or'becaufe, like a great part of the world,
they prefer error to truth, or for the fame
reaforir that our Lord assigns for men's loving
tlarLntfs' rather than Ugh;.
Q. 4. " Why do these rarely become
those P'
viz. Why do unitarians rarely become trini
tarians P
A. Because men who have imbibed so
dangerous and inveterate an error as unitari
anifm, or the rejection of Chrifl't
are seldom cured of it.
PAUL.
Extract from the speech of Charles Pinck
ney, Governor of the State of South-Ca
rolinn, to tbel.egiflatureofthat ftateatthe
opening of their session on the 23d ult.
On the fubjeft of our intercourse with
foreign powers, it is my duty to acquaint
you, that on the President of the United
States being informed, the French republic
hadrefufed to receive out minister, and that
their a;Â»ents and cruisers continued to seize
the vessels of our citizens, he cotifidered it
as his duty to call a fpecia! meeting of con
gressâthat they did convene, and after hav
ing agreed in opiniory with the president,
that another attempt fliould be instituted to
fettle our differences, by negociation,
had passed some adh : among the most
important of which, are the aftÃ for
prohibiting far a limited time the exporta
tion of arms and arjimunit/cn^âfor prevent
ing the citizens the United Stales from pri
vateering against nations in amity with usâ
providing for the further defence cf the
ports and harbours of the United Statesâ
authorifing a detachment of the militia of
the United Statesâfor registering and en
rolling, (hips and veffehâfor making certain
appropriations for additional expenditures,
and laying duties on (lamp vellum, parch
ment and paper.
On the laws for authorising the president
to call out a certain proportion of the mili
tia, I have a&ed as far as reded with mc,
by issuing the necessary orders to the adju
tant general, fdr apportioning their quotas
on the refpeftive brigades, and ordering
them to hold themselves itl readiness to
marclSi at a moment's warning, and he has
issued orders to the brigadiers for their re
turns to enable him to do so. Most of
these aÂ£s have keen passed by Congress
with a view to place us in a state of prepa
ration, fliould the republic of France still
continue unfriendly, or refufe to assent to
an Amicable adjustment of our differences.
I trust, however, that from the arrival of
our envoys, and the manner in which our
government have again attempted to adjust
our differences, the moderation and justice
of both nations will prevailâthat they will
repair recent injuries and recolleft former
mutual fufferings and servicesâthat they
will remember, it is always the true interest
of republics to aid and protedl each other,
and that the present negociation may termi
nate in producing as harmonious a connec
tion, as has hitherto existed between the
two countries. Convinced as lam from the
most deliberate reflection, that considering
our original conneflion, and the nature and
principles , as to commercial views ofboth go
vernments, â¢white tve can do it with honor,
it is our interest to be upon tke most friend
ly terms with France, it has been with as
much concern I have viewed our
differences, as it is now with pleasure I find
myfelf enabled to communicate to you the
appointment, during your recess, of three
gentlemen of known character and talents,
to repair to Paris, invefttd with proper pow
ers to terminate them. As I have already
observed, the solemn manner in which this
embassy was formed, is a proof how highly
our government value the friendfliip, and
how important they conceive the intercourse
with France to beâand as there can be no
doubt of our envoys being vested with am
ple powers, I have been led to expedt the
most favorable consequences Should our
differences with France be amicably fettled,
those with Spain, her ally, will of course be
more easily accommodated.
It was my wish, and I had some ground
to cxpeiSt, it would have been in my power,
at the opening of fhjs session, to have con
gratulated you oa the termination of differ
ences among ail the belligereDt powers ; and
.thct to the unexampled horrors and diftrciT
es, produced by. a contett, extending thro'
afynoll every part of the civiii/.ed world, a
period was to succeed, when liberty, with
the gcujnl arii of peace and coinm<rfÂ«t might
Â«ft:iblim-lic!* mild .dominion â.when From the
w.fe and proper uie of these advantages, you
j may have b-.en enabled torccoHeft, without
; regret, that the sacred ilame you fir it kin
â  died had-fuccefafully extended through the
faireft parts of the earth, and that wc had
repaid the benefits derived front thcoid world
in their discovery and fettlemcnt of the new
by an example, and by light and infti uftion
upon qqeltioris of all others the most inter
eiting to them. It is with the deepest con
cern, therefore, I am to announei to you,
that the negociatiotis for peace between the
powers at war have ended without fuceefs j
and that it is yet uncertain what will be the
future fituacion of Europe, and of the na
tions with whom we are most .connected.
ImpoflibLe as it must be for us, at this time,
and at this distance, to form an accurate o
pinion of the events which have ptoduced
these late and important cl.'jgesâlament
ing 83 we must do, the continuance of the
war, and its attendant calamities, let us
still hope they may soon fee their true' inter
est in the establishment of a general peace,
and that the mcafures produced by our ex
ample, maybe followed by the fame mode
ration which accompanied our revolutionâ
that they may really prove a bleffmg to the
people who have imitated usâthat when
the heat, which must ever accompany the
deftrudtion of ancient despotisms, and the
eredtion of republics, is subsided, the change
(hall operate so beneficially, as amply to re
pay the ravages of the contest, and that the
time is nfct distant, when such proper and
liberal fyllnms, in the intercourse of nations
(hall be generally established, as will be the
means of preventing wars, and ensuring to
the world the blefiinga of peace, and an un
disturbed and general commerce.
COMMERCE.
An exaft lift of the (hips of different Nati
ons that have passed the Sound in the
Yoars 1790 and 1796.
The navigation of the Sound has been
Â» considered as an objeft of so much import
ance in a political light, that the following
account of the Trade of two years, at a
considerable distance from each other, must
necessarily be received with interest and at
tention.

The foregoing lift must give rife to im
portant reflections and remarkable compan
ions. The annual revenues arising from
the toll levied upon vessels palling through
the Sound, has been generally estimated at
between J and 600,c0c rix dollars :fo that
the Royal Treasury must have received near
ly 150,000 rix dollars in the year
1796 than in the year 1790. It does not
belong to this place to enter into the caufe3
of so extraordinary an encreafe in the navi
gation of the Sound, which for the most
part, depends upon political circumstances,
upon enctcafing speculations, and the spirit
of commerce. It is fufficient to remark,
that this navigation has encreafed about a
fourth in the interval of the time between
the years 1790 and 1797. ThefubjeÂ£ts of
one cotmtry (Denmark) must observe with
the fentiment# of patriotism and gratitude
hew much their trade has been promoted
by the wife measures of their government,
and what sources ofprofperity have been o
penedto them. The encreafe of Prussia and
Sweden has been aluioft incredible, the
trade of the former being encreafed to near
ly a triple,fand the latter almost in a quintu
ple proportion.
Great Britain, whose navigation has en
creafed with the present war, is also a consi
derable gainer by the encreafe of her trade
to the East Sea. But the French Revoluti
on, and the war which fuccceded it, harÂ«
produced themoftmelancholyconfequence* to
the tradeofFranceandHolland,andha*e been
no less deftrudtive to their Baltic trade than
to their commerce inother partsof the world.
j France, whose merchantmen formerly passed
1 the Sound in considerable numbers, cannot
s reckon a finglc (hip in the year 1796 ; and
. Holland, that country so famous for its
, wealth, the commercial rival of Great-Brit
ain, and which before the Revolution had
j drawn to itfelf a considerable part of the
5 trade of the East Sea, saw that important
r branch of its commerce reduced in the last
1 year to a single (hip. The trade of the U

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, t'c
TUESDAV DECEMBER, 1 0l
The Speaker informed the ffinife that he I as
had received a letter from the diredtor of the aÂ«
mint, inclosing a report, in purfuanee to the te
order of the house pafled yesterday. This t'c
reportftates, that it is not deemed prudent at
to.take i.ity the mint mote bullion than can pi
be worjced\in one mafa, when it comes from le
any oFtlie batiks of the city, from whence E
it can be had ia a very (hort tioiewhen want
ed ; that deg,of)ts qre now wm'ting till such m
as are in hand are finifhed ; that it is ex- ri
pedted the banks of this city and of New- 01
York will'make deposits for about 300,000 er
dollars, in French crowns, bt.it that these oi
deposits are kept back until prior ones are 01
paid off; that when there is fufficient bill- ol
lion in the mint to keep one press striking, lii
this will be done at the rate of from 18 to tÂ«
20,000 dollars weekly. Th? gold coin en
creafes in amount according to its addition- tl
al value. It is stated that the gold bullion c<
deposited in the mint, since the 29th No- ti
vember, 1796 (<he time at which the lalt b
report was made) to the iÃt.h instant, was 'I
5997 oz. rj dwts. 9 gr. value 106,626 dol- y<
lars and 95 cents. ThÂ« quantity,of silver re
bullion deposited, during the fame period, y
has been 42,15 1 oz. 8 gr. value 48,635 dol- tj
lars 76 cents 5 mills. The quantity of fil- al
ver coin iflued fiuce the last report is stated tl
tohavebeen 12,546 dollars, 3918 half-dol- ft
lars", 252 quarter-dollars, 25,261 difmes, ei
44,527 hqlC difmesâamounting in the f:
wholif tp 19,320 dollars cents. That tl
Â«!ere nearly ready for delivery in the h
mint 34,d60 dollars in silver coins. It is ti
also stated that the quantity of gold coin ri
ifftied, during the fame period, has been ri
eagles,' 6406 half-eagles, 1756 qr. b
eagies; equal to the value of 128,190 dol- p
lars. n
Mr. T. Claiborne moved the usual order b
for printing this report. . t
Mr. Nicholas had no objeÂ£tion to the re
port beinrr printed ; that it might be taken I
into consideration when the fiibjedt of the t
mint (hould come before the house ; but t
hoped it would be fuffered to lie on the ta- f
ble until the bill, with which some gentle- c
men had fuppofedit to be connected, (hould t
be pa(Ted, in order that it might be referred
to whilst on the table by those who wi(hed r
it, as he trusted they (hould not delay the a
consideration of the bill relative to foreign c
coin until this report (hould be printed.
Mr. Thatcher could not fee the use of <
printing the report, after the fubjedt to t
which it alluded was disposed of. This I
would be like executing a man and then I
trying him. The printing of these papers,
he supposed, could not .delay the business 1
more than 24 hours, or 48 at most. He '
thought, therefore, it would be much bet- ]
ter that they (hould be printed, than that 1
the clerk fnould be frequently called upon 1
to read them, or that the members (hould 1
coljefl in clubs, as on a former
occasion we suppose, on the Qua
ker*'petition) to read them, in different
parts of the house.
The motion for printing was pw.t and car
ried.
Mr. Harrifon presented a memorial from
D.M. Randolph, mar(hallofthediftriÂ£t of Vir
ginia, complaining of the ruinous state of ]
the prisons in that quarter ; dating the ut
ter impoflibility of confining any person, un
der proccfs of the courts of the United
States, for debt, who wiihed to be at liber
ty, and that on account of this defeat seve
ral persons had made their escape from him,
and he was fuÂ«d by their creditors for their
debts. He prays relief in the premises, re
ferred to a feleit committee of five.
Mr. Baird presented a petition from Si
mon Cogler, a soldier in late war, pray
ing for compensation for nie services ; and
Mr. Sewall one from G. Pomeroy, Rat
ing that he had not only loft his house and
furniture, but several certificates of public
debt, for which he prays reeompenfe.
Both these petitions were referred to the
committee of claims.
Mr. Harper, from the committee appoint
ed to prepare and report a bill prescribing
the mode of taking evidence in cafei of con
tested eleÂ£tions, and to compel the attend
ance of witnesses, reported a bill according
ly, which was twice read, and committed for
Monday.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
claims, made an unfavourable report on the
petition of John Black, which was concur
red in by the house.
i Mr. Harper called for the order of the
day on the report of the committee of ways
and means, on the petition of William Tom
linfen and others, citizens of the state of
Virginia, which being agreed to, the house
resolved itfelf into a committee of the whole
accordingly.
The petition states, that in consequence
of the conftniftion put by the Treasury De
partment on the aits for laying duties on
spirits distilled within the United States and
on (tills, persons desirous of obtaining licen
ces for diltiliing, pursuant to the aft of the
3d of March, 1797, on that fubjeft, are
required to make their eleftion, as to the
length of time to which the licence (hall ex
tend and the time of its commencement in
the month of June, the time fixed by law
for making entry of stills. From hence they
alledge that great inconveniences reftilt to
the dilliller ; itiafmuch as it impossible to
forefee, so early as June, what quantity of
fruit or grain, the year will afford, and,
fequently, for the owners of stills to judge j
when, or for what length of time, they
ought to take out their licences.
This conftruftion, the committee fyid,
has heen adopted by the Treasury Depart
raent, and they coaceive that it lia3 been
property adopted" ;tkit though they con- t!| .
ceive the conilruftion put on the aft, i"97Â»
by the Treasury De|?&rtnient, to be (triftly . (v ,
legal, they are nevertheless, of opinion, that p r
for the reafbti set forth by the petitioners, m
it mult, in its effeft, prove highly ineonve- la
nient and detrimental both to individuals and
the public. And they have the fatisfaftion
to find, that the Secretary of the Treasury, j
with whom they thought proper to confer p,
on the fubjeft, agrees with them in opinion eft
as to the expediency of altering the law so
as to' permit owners of stills, having duly en- ft
tered them, to make their election both as b<
so the time, and the extent of their lieences th
at whatever period may suit them belt.
purftiance of these ideas, the committee beg of
leave to present, for tha consideration of the
House, the following resolution : B
" Refolded, That it is expedient so to a- tli
mend the several afts refpeftingdutieson fpi- cc
ritÂ« distilled within the United States, and hi
on stills, as to permit owners of stills, duly as
entered, to make their election, at any time p
of the year, both as to the time of taking h
out licences purfnant to the said aits, or any rr
of them, and as to the period to which such c<
licences (hall extendâand that the commit- fÂ«
tee have leavetobring in a billaccordingly." ti
Mr. Gallatin proposed an amendment to c
the report. Besides the duty paid'on licen- si
ces taken out for a (horter time than a year,
there was a duty of 54 cents per gallon paid o
by those who choose to enter by the year, a
This duty wasnb other than a licence by the
year, though not so called. The proposed b
resolution would not reach licences by the
year, tho' he thought it ought, as person! f
taking outalicence for a year, were as much t
at a loss to know in the month of June, whe
ther their crops would enable them to distil r
for so long a time as to make it their inter- f
eft to do so, as. those who took licences out t
for a shorter period. The consequence was, r
that, in the part of the country from whence
he came, scarcely any person ventured to t
take opt n licence for the year, but rua the 1
rilk of taking out a licence for a (horter pe
riod. This-was inconvenient, as it proba- )
bly left their stills for several months unem- i
ployed, and had an effeft to injure the reve
nue. He hoped therefore, the report would 1
be extended to yearly licences, as well as to ]
those for a (horter period.
Mr. Harper seconded this amendment.â
He said it would have been introduced into ,
the report if the committee had thought j
themselves at liberty to do so ; but as the ]
petition referred to them did not complain
of this part of the aft, they did not think
themselves authorized to touch it.
The motion was agreed to, the committee
rose, the hoS'e agreed to the amendment,
and a bill was directed to be brought in ac
cordingly.
Mr. Coit called for the order of the day
on the report of the committee of claims, on
the petition of Anna Welfli; which motion
being agreed to, the house resolved itfelf in
to a committee of the vvhfteon the fubjeft.
The petitioner asks for as allowance of the
seven years half-ply, promised to the widows
and orphans 0? certain officers killed in the ser
vice of the United States, durfng the late war.
It appears that Mrs. Wellh's hulband was a cap
tain of marines âthat he served cn the expedi
tion to Pennbfcot, ai.d wjs there (lain ; but the
resolution of Csrigrefi, promising seven years
half-pay to the officers who fell in service, did
not extend to the widows of officers of the na
vy. The petitioner, as executrix of the I aft will
Â»nd testament of her brother, George Hurlbut,
deceased, further asks for an allowance of the
conamuta. ion, and land warrants, to which flic
apprehends she iÂ« entitled, on the principle that
her brother continued in service till the end of
the war. That gentleman was a captain in
Sheldon's regiment of light-dragoons : he was
wounded by the enemy, in the performance sf
his duty, at Tarry town, in thefummer of 1781,
and langui(hed of his wounds until the Bth of
May, 1783, when he died.âBy the afl of Con
grels of the aiftof Oflober, 17X0, half-pay for
life was promised to the officers of the army,
who should continue in the service to the end of
tbeiuar. This was afterwards, on the aid of
March, 1789, commuted for five years full pay.
If captain Hurlbut i : ved to the end of the war,
he was entitled to commutation, and in his right
â  the petitioner, as executrix of his will, anil le
. gatee, would be entitled, otherwise not. The
[ question then arising is, when did the waread ? â 
or in other words, was there an end of the war
. before thu Bth of May, 178J, the day of captain
Hurlbut's death ? On the solution of the quef
: tlop, relts the claim of the petitioner for com
mutation ; it being plared on the ground of con
: f?afl only. The provrfional articles of peace
between the United States awd Great-Britain,
were ligned November 301 1781, and the treaty
between France and Great-Britain, on which
' the efficacy <.f thrife articles was conditioned, np
' on the acth of January 1783. The firft infoT
â  mation Congress appear to have had of them,
- was on the 24th of March 1783, when the ar
r tned velTcls, cruising muter commiflions from
the United States, were refilled. Oh the nth
p April 1783, 5 reflation of hostilities was ordered
by proclamation of Congress. On the 2;, dof
" April, Congress, by their resolution of that
" date, declared thsir opinion, that " the time of'
tie men engaged to serve during the zvitr, dies
e nst expire until the ratification ef the definitive
s treaty of peace." By the atfls of May i 6, June
it, Jvuguft 9, antl September 26, 178.1, Con
s grefs direfted parts of the army tobe fnrloughed,
and by their proclamation on the 18th OiSlober

s ter the 3d November, thtn enftung, fnch part

as terminated, when the preliminaries of

There were upwards of Six Thousand

An express had been dispatched to Car
rickfergus, as we ancipitated, containing
an order for respiting execution for Mr Orr
until Tuesday next.âPrrfs.
The case-os thisrunfortunate gentleman is
peculiarly distressing. It is attended with
eircumftances which, in the minds of all f
candid persons, mud be allowed to havf '
great weight. No motive (h'ould ever in
duce us to interfere with Courts and Juries ; :
but when repentant Jurors come forward to
impeach and invalidate their own decifionâ
and when the fate of a man, generally
known and warmly esteemed in his own
country, depends upon such decision, it is
the duty of the press to throw every possi
ble light on the affair.âlbid.
It appears that four of the jurors have vo
luntarily come forward, and made solemn
affidavits to this effeft, after mature delibe
ration : That when they had retired to their
room to deliberate upon the evidence given
against Mr. Orr, liqnor was introduced, and
instead of weighing and comparing eircum
ftances, they proceeded to drink, and to
such a degree, that there was a general in
toxication. In this (late, one of the jurors
used threats to intimidate the reft. He
charged them with harbouring difioyal prin
ciples, and should they refufe to join him in
bringing in a verdict, finding Mr. On guil
ty, he denounced vengeance against them.
Under the intimidation thus produced in the
room, the jury were led {o a (Tent to such
verdift. But the spur Jurors above menti
oned, swear, that even the menaces made a
gainst their persons and dwellings would not
have seduced 'them to so criminal an r.Â£t,
were it not for the liquor which they had
taken ; and from having been imposed on
by a representation that Mr. Orr's life was
in no danger, as their recommendation to
Â»ercy, accompanying their verdict, would
infallibly procure him the clemency of Gov
ernment. They further swear, that in their
minds the cafe was doubtful, which they
stated even in the verdidt itfelf.âlbid.
This is the substance of an affidavit duly
made in open court by four of Mr. Orr's ju
rors. It requires no comment. But if fur
ther matter were wanting to induce the lord
Lieutenant, who is bound to administer jus
tice in mercy, to stay the arm of the execu
tioner, it offers in the confefllon of Whitly,
thp principal evidence against him on the
prosecution. This man has deposed on oath
before a inagillrate, that he felt great com
pun&ion of conscience, not only for this
crime which he had committed against Mr.
Orr, but for other crimesâand that what,
he had alledged against Mr. Orr was falfe.

On Friday lad a new Synagogue was
consecrated in Denmark-court, by the Rev-
Isaac Levy. The following isa short dletch
of the ceremony. The Books of the
Law were brought from the Vestry room
imo the Synagogue, the bearers pafling un
der a canopy supported by four men j on
their entrance the Reader said, " Blefled be
they who come in the name of the Lord.'â
They were then put into the Ark, and car
ried seven times round the Altar, Psalms be
ing at the fame time sung by the Reader,
the 81ft, 26th, 74th, 122 d, 132 d, and
1 ooth. The Books of the Law were again
deposited in the Ark, when the Reader
sung a Poem, the fame as that sung at the
Dedication of the House of David. At tfre
conclusion of this, three of the Books were
taken out of the Ark, one of which was
given to the principal Reader, who ascend.
Ed the Altar, supported by a Reader on each
fide, with books in their arms, singing a
Hymu in compliment te the~Royal Family,

companied by a band of mV.ltc. The three
books being again put into the Ark, the
Reader sung a Psalm, and the whole eonclud

The following abftra<& of the speech made
by fean Debrie, in vindication of the con
duct of the French'goÂ«rqtoorit wth refpeft
tp Venice and Genoa, it} the council oÂ£ five
hundred on the 12th hilt. is taken from the
Republican Francais .
" One of the conspirators, whose perfidy
you have puiiithsl (Dunjurd), (Ktei-ed, in
this tribune, a proposition tending to en Â»;:i
---d.r trouble ar-.d difq'iiet in our armies, when,
on the f'ibjoft of the innTdcres commuted on
the French lick at Verona, and, fever.il oth
er eities of Italy, he iufirmited that the di
re&ory or g-'pfcral in chief hatl gnne beyond
their powers in takiilg exemplary vengeance
of the VenAian government. Such con
duft, said he, is contrary to the law of m
tions, and cnlc.nlated to dilhinifh the digni
ty of the French people. He concluded
1 with obtaining the appointment of a Tpccial
committee to make a report 011 this fubjedt
" The 528 th article of the conflitution
dates, that " in the cafe ur hoftifities -im
pending or already commenced; pr
preparation? of war, against the French"re
public, the executive directory ought- to
employ, in defence of the state, the means
placed at its difpoful to fee tire the public
tranquility, provided that due .information
be communicated to- the legislative body."
" But it is fufficient to read the manifefto
of general Buonaparte, to be convinced that
the dire&ory was juftifiable in its conduit
towards* Venice.
" The partizans of despotism employed
'hemfelves in calumniating the French, in
treating them as jacobins, terrorists and regi
cides ; they irritated the people against the
French government ; and the Venetians 1
were in confluence, seen to affaffi.iate our
generous soldiers, to poignard them public
ly, and heard to ring, a second time, the
Sicilian vespers for the dtÃruftion of our ar
mies. They united Cowardice to. ferocity,
and availed themfelvss, in their attack, of
the moment when it was reported that the
French fled before the Archduke.
" Buonsrparte soon after repelled th;.- ag- :
grefiion, and triumphed. His enemies be
came fupplaints; a negociation was entered
on, and surely the right of war permits to
itljpofe laws on the vanquished. With re
gard to Genoa, the multiplied aÂ£ts which
have embroiled it in war with us, have been
already publiihed. Genoa, oftener than
once, displayed its favour for England ; and
one of our frigates was a (Faulted by the Ge
noese in their very ports.
" But, besides, does it become us to reÂ»
proach nations with (hakingoff theirchains?
On this principle wefhould accufetheFrench
for having annihilated the throne on the 10th
of Augult. Did not the numerous victo
ries which have signalized the war of liber
ty, hold forth grand examples to more than
one people ? And wa3 not the admiration
excited by the exploits of French republi
cans, capableof rotifing more than one neigh
boring qation to imitate us ?
" The chief ruin of Venice was its despo
tic aristocracy, its crooked policy, its secret
ambition, and punic faith. It is not, there
fore, the conduft alone of Venice withref
peft to us, but also the radical vice of its
Oligarchic government,which operated the
deftruAiori of that State. Nor are there,
probably, any but the molt itifamoufly per
fidious, who would consider the French go
vernment as criminal -in having repelled vio
lence by force, and in having puni/hed Laf
fafilns.
' t ' The excesses of demagogues have been
every where repressed in Italy by the French
government: every where the liberty of
worship has been refpedted ; but were the
dire&ory to negleft the means of securing
to the republic the fruits of her vidtories ?
" Let us always aft in fiicli a manner that
other governments may dread to go to war
with us, and wilh to preserve peace.
" I return thanks, in the name ou the
peace which the defender! of liberty have
conquered for usâl return thanks tÂ» the
French government,for having made so good
a life of its triumphs. A conqueror form
erly human facrifices among the
Gauls : our generals and soldiers have imi
tated this excellent example, by deflroying
the mondcr feudality in the countries which
they might have governed by the
right of conquest. I move that the com
mittee appointed on the sth of Meflidor on
the motion of Dumolard, be immediately
difiblved.
The motion was agreed to unanimoufiy,
and the speech of Jean Debrie was ordered
to be printed.
