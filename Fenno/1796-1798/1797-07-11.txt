I HAVE laid before the President cf j

expedition is preparing on the lakes, 00 the
part of the English ; the objeft of which is
to attack upper Louisiana, and to take by

First remarking, that the government of

nor the'knowledge of any circumltances in
dicative of such a design as that yovrfwfpeft,
I have the honpr to afture you, that true
to the prindples of aft impaftiid neutrality
to which the United States have hitherto
invariably adhered, their government will ,
be anxious to maintain the rights of their ,

WHILST I poflefs new reasons for be- f
lieving that it is intended to cariy into effeft
the expedition againll Upper Louisiana, on A
tjie part of the Enjglifh,:by violating the J
territory of the United States, as was ma- j
njfefted to you in my letter of the 2d March /
last, I must add that I know to a certainty n
that the English have made propositions to t.
Gen. Clarke, of Georgia, in order to avail e
themselves of his influence in that State, /,
together wi(h fopie other persons, for mak- p
ing a diversion or serious attack again ft 0
Florida; and as by your letter ftf the 11 th 0
of the last month, you aflure roe that the
United States, would take the neceffaiy
meafures for causing their neutrality to be. j
rcfpetfled, I do not .doubt that in confe-,
quence of this my information, the execu
tive govenimerit jvill take the proper steps,
in order th?t Georgia also should not in
fringe the laws of neutrality to the injury
of the poffeflions of the king my master.

Sir, I
I HAVE the honour to acknowledge t ,
the receipt of your letter 1 of the 21ft inft. n
repeating your suspicions that it is intended
to carry into effeft an expedition, on the
part ps the Epglifli, against Upper Louift-
ana, thrpugh ( the territory of the U. States ; ,{
and adding that you know to a certainty 0
that the Englifti have made propositions to tl
Gen.-Clarke in Georgia, to obtain his infltf-
ence in that State, with a view to a diversi
on pr serious attack against. Florida.
To the firft polpt I have the honor to 5
answer, that although this government is
still destitute of any knowledge of fatfts or
circumftancec indicating that an expedition
on the part of the Engliih, against Upper
Louisiana, ha? heen projefted, yet deftrous
ps .living on terms of amity with our nejgh
bours, on one fide and .the other, agreeably
to fubfiftiilg treaties, I have cojmmunicatcd .
to the Minister of his Britannic Majesty, 1
for the information ps his government, the 1
suspicions you have exprelfed, of an intended w
expedition against Upper Louisiana, and P
the declaration of the Prefiden.t of the U.
States, that he cannot cbnfent that either
should march troops through the U. States
to attack the other. The sense of the t '
American Government being thus declared e
beforehand, we cannot presume that a mea
sure will be undertaken which cannot be a '
prosecuted without a violation of our ueu
tral rights. 11
With regard to the profpeft of an expe
dition by the Britilh against Florida, with
the aid of Gen. Clarke, and of persons
whom he might influence, I have to inlbrrn
you that orders have been forwarded to the
djftrict attorney ps Georgia tp enquire into
the fa& as stated by you, and, if discovery
should be made of designs to -violate our
neutral duties, and especially of forming an .
expedition against the territory of bis Ca

e 'Sir,
s IHE minificr bf his Catholic majesty, early
' March Ictfl, represented to this government
J his ffpicions that an expedition was preparing
1 on the lakes, on the part of the Englj'j, whofi
1 cbjeii <was an attack on the Spanifhp jjs in Up
â  per Louisiana by a rtnite through ihe t rritory of
the United States, and requejled t'je govern
â  meat to take meafares necejfary to prevent such
â  a violation of their territory.
In the aiifwer to the spanish, minifier, ifter
the remark that the governnta t' of the United
States had no knowledge of toy circufnjlances
indicative of the dejign he Ji fie fled, he was as
sured that, tree to the principles of an impar
tial neutrality, to -which the,United,States Lvve
hitherto invariably adhered, their government
Would be anxious to maintain the rights of ihtir
neutral Jituption, and on all occafyns adopt
and pursue the measures which fhq/dd appear
proper and expedient for thqt end^/"'
His Catholic Majefly's miniJUr having late
ly renewed his reprtjfiliation, declaring that he
had recent ground to believt that it is intended to
carry into ejlÃ the extodttion before mentioned
again/1 Upper Low fane, through the territory
of the United Stafes, lam direfled by the Pre
sident of the United States to make to you this
communication, and to declare,, that desirous of
living on ierjns of amity with their neighbours
on one fide and the other, agreeably to fublifi
it-g treaties, he cannot copfent that either should
march troops through the territory of the Uni
ted Sta-es to attack the other.
The fefife and motives of the American gov
ernment being thus exprejfed, I doubt not the
fame will be duly refpeSed on (he part of the
Briti/hgovernment ; and without judging whe
ther the suspicions of his Catholic majefly's mi
nijler ate or are not founded, lam persuaded
that the declaration now made will be confder
ed as a proof of our good will, by preventing
the great expense of preparations for an enter
prise which cannot be prosecuted without occasi
oning a violation of the neutral rights or duties
of the United States.

ALTHOUGH I received in duetimethe

me on the 16th ult.âan indisposition, from
which I am not yet altogether recovered,
prevented me from replying to the enquiry
you.make relative to the evacuation of the
Spanish pdfts within the pew line of demar
cation of limits. I now take up my pen
to inform you that several rnonths have
elapsed since I ha/.e received a litter from
the Baron de CaroncMet, and of course I
am deprived of any information touching
the Heps taken for the execution cf the
treaty
I offer rr.yfelf to yo;:r disposal, praying
God to preserve your life many years.

[TRANSLATION.]
Eight or ten days ago I made knoiyn to
you the ir.fcrrftation which I had received
from the baron de Carondelet, relative to
the'occurrences at the Natchez, between tha
governor don Manuel Gaynfo de Lenrea
and th'i corsmiffisner of U:)iud States,
[Volume XII.Ms. Ellicott j and .beiag defiroai at tkli
time to avoid all equivocation, a$ to the Cub- E
ilance of those letters, I have determined
tq communicate it tp you in writing* f-
By the 2d article of the treaty with
Spain it is ttipulated that thtgarrifms which
firefoundabove the line ofdernarcaVon agreed fe
x>n,ihall be'withdravvn. Settingout then with ri
this principle, it appears that the sfft ope
ration ought to be t6 draw this line, in or- p
der to know which were 4he garrKorts which I
were to withdraw according to the article n,
cited; and although the Natchez and some â¢ a
other Spani{h polls. are probably fttuated a- *j
bove the said line of demarcation, the for- it
rnality and delicacy which one government a
owes to another, required that Mr. Ellicott c,
"should not pretend to take, pofleflion of the 1
territory until the said demarcation (hould C
be spade, and the njore .so, as he had been f
infoiWd officially that the Spuniih engineer, b
M. Guillemard, was already on his way to j
faifil this part of liis com million. e
Mr. Ellicott not attending to these jufl
obfervayons, immediately began to wound I
tjie feelings of the Spanish Commander by 1
ho&ling the American flag on the territory J
which would not belong to the United
Slates, till after having jointly made the as- <
rranoLiiical observations for afeertaining the >
fcOurfe*eif the.line. Not content with this,
he began to exereffe an authority, to wit,
that of for the United States in a
place whiih was .then u l nder the juvifdidlion
of the Spiu. iih govern men t.
These imprudences, which can admit of
no txcufe, give rife to a personal resentment, i
from which there is little to hope with res- '
peit to harmony between those Commiflion- '
ers'in fixture. \ !
In tnefe clrcumftances, the Governor 1
General cf the province, the Baron de Car
ondelet, made known thejull dodbts which <
he had about the deliveVy of the polls, ft nee
in the 2d article, it is not flipulated that they
were to Up> .and it i'ety"s jt
could never have been the intention of his
Catholi* Majblty to deliver up any fort?fi
cations on he had expended gr&t
fumaof money, which through political
viciflitudes might perhaps be one day preju
dicial to his subjects. In this situation,
prudence required that the defcifion of this
doubtful point (hould be left to the two go
vernments ; but Mr. Ellicott adding impru
dence to imprudence, and with a pretext
which a quarrel between some drunken
Chickafaws and the people of his company,
afforded him, not only violated a territory
then Spanish, by deuring to excite the
inhabitants by all imaginable means, but al
so carried his zeal so far as to attempt to get
pofleflionofthefort ofthe Natchezby surprise.
Govenqr Gayofo fays he has in his power
douaments which prove evidently the inten
tion of this attempt: Such conduft was lit
tle calculated to produce the spirit of harmo
nyin such circumftaqces, and obliged Go
vernor Gayofo when he difcovercd such
hostile intentions, to take on his part, mea
fure3 necessary for his defence.
This is the true Hate of things, by which
it clearly appears th?t the inconsiderate con
"dust of Mr. Ellicott is the only cause of the
disagreement at the Natchez; the more so,
as the Spanish commanders declared to him
that while the two governments were deci
ding on the doubt which occurred to the Ba
jÂ»n de Carondelet, about the delivery of the
posts, the drawing of the line of demarcation
might be begun, when Mr. de Guillemard,
who had already departed from New Orleans
for the Natchez, should arrive.
If in this situation of the business, the
commanders changed their ideas, or their
measures, it could only proceed from the
imprudent conduct of Mr. Ellicott. Ihe
Baron de Carondelet, desirous of observing
rcligioufly the treaty,- so far as was not in
consistent with his duty, feeing the personal
resentment which exists between Mr- Elli
cott and Governor Gayofo, desires that there
jnay be ifent to command the detachment
of American troops on that frontier, a man
of judgment and prudence, who in such de
licate circumflances shall aft with modera
tion, which is of so much importance to- tbe.
two governments.
This is what I had the honour of com
municating verbally to you fir, in my lafl
conference and 1 repeat it now; recommend
ing moCe particularly that there should be"
sent on the part of the United States to that
frontier, a p'erfon of prudence and found
judgment; leaving to Mr. Ellicott the tech
nical part only; for while he atts as princi
pal, it is to be feared that we shall not fee
the agents of the two governments, which
are interested, proceed with that union pnd
harmony which is ever important to us.
I repeat, fir; my wishes of obliging you,
and that our Lord may preserve your life
many years.

Thursday, July 6. hi
(Concluded from our last.)
Mr. Sitgreates said, it was observable e {
that no gentleman had ventured to do w
any more than exprvfs his doubts, both as b<
to the faft and the law on this occasion. t e
With refpeft to the faft, he did not expect
ahydoubt. He believed that any gentleman t (
at all conversant with tic branch of law w
learning, which relatesto impeachment,muft t c
know that impeachments have always been , r
founded on official documents, or upon cir- 0
cumftances of notoriety, and not upon facts n
found as oefore a Grand Jury. In this in- []
stance they had conceived the letter of Mr. t ]
Blount fufficiently authenticated, in the
communication of the President.
He was sorry that the measures which 0
the Executive had taken in this business, t ]
should "have been censured, even by infinua- b
tion. Mr. Si said,. he had read the opinio* p
â¢of high law authority, which had been ob- ti
tained by the Executive. When he> did t,
this, he thought lie was giving proof of the c
honourable motives of the Executive. In- t
formation had been given to the Executive,
which, on the firft blush, shewed designs c
against the peace of the United States. It
was the duty of the President' to preserve f
the peace of the" United States. It was g
natural and right for him, therefore, to take f
the opinion of those peifons who were best r
qualified to direst him what course would c
be be ft to be pursued. Thei'e gentlemen t
had given it as their opinion that the proper {
way of proceeding would be by impeach
ment, and, in effeft, that the President had ,
no more to do with it, but that it should be ,
turned over to the proper branches of Gov- ,
ernment. In corifequence the President had
communicated more to them, than he had ,
done to the Senate, as the original fetter of â¢
William Blount was sent to them, as evi
dence upon which they were to found their
charge. The President did not direst them
to impeach ; but had laid before them
the fads, with the opinion of the law offi
cers.
Mr. S. conceived that the conduit of the
President had been ftriftly proper. He
would pass on to the constitutional doubts
which had been expressed. It waS acknow
ledged that there, was no reftriftion upon
the right of impeachment ; but his col
league thought that something like a rfftric
tibu flight be gathered from the 4th clause
of the 2d article of the Constitution, which
! he had quoted. It was to be observed, that
â  this article was found in that part of the
Couftitution wlrich related Only to the Ex
ecutive department of government. This,
he took it, was a good reason why this rule
should not be taken as a rule in the present
â  cafe ; but there was another clause which
' spoke of disqualifying persons from ever
, filling any office in future, which was a
â  greater power than that under the Execu
-1 tive department. If the conftruftion which
: his colleague had put upon the Constitution
) with refpeft to impeachment, was the true
f one, an officer of Government would not be
t brought to trial after he had resigned, as he
could not then be removed from office,
t His colleague had produced another arti
, cle of the Constitution, which confined the
, ' punishment under an impeachment. This,
b Mr. S. said, was meant to guard against any
1 difgraceful excefsof governmental venge
f ance, or party venom ; because it went on
- to fay, that if the offence was/within ordi
nary crimes, it might be prosecuted and
punished in the fame way as if an impeach
ment had not taken place.
Impeachment was then to be ccinfidered
9 as for the purposes Of the State, distinguish
ed from the general purposes of society.
5 If it had been intended that the power of
J impeachment should he limited in the man
-1 ner supposed by his colleague and the gen
ii tleman from Virginia, it would have been
a so exprefled, as in the Constitution of Penn
sylvania ; they had spoken on this fubjeft
1 in a way not to be mistaken, as they ex
f prefsly said who were liable to impeachment,
Â» and what offences should be impeachable.â
- And if it had been the intention of the
y Constitution of the United States, that of
- ficers of Government only should be im
a peached, it would doubtless have been so ex
pressed. But was not the present cafe, that
k of an officer charged with an offence direftly
>â¢ connected with his office, with the official
confidence entrusted to him ? When it was
g particularly his duty to appoint to office, it
I was surely a peculiarly aggravated offence
a to seduce an officer, or to turn friends into
1- enerrtws. What was a Senator, if he was
not an officer of Government ? The Pre
sident, who was liimfelf a branch of the
Government, was allowed to be an officer
58 of the Government, and surely a member
of one of the blanches must also be an of
ficer.
e, As to the form of proceeding necessary
I'd to be taken 011 this occasion, he would state
what the opinion of the Committee was as
r- to this matter. They supposed it would
be firft proper for that House to determine
that the gentleman in question fho'jld helm
peached. This being done, that a mem-Wr, â
of that House should go to the bar cf the
Senate, and impeach the person, in the name
of the House, and of the people the
United States, an;} Hate that the House of
Rejarefeniatives will proceed to draw out
ipeci'iic articles of charge against him. Ac
cording to the cafe, they require that he
(hall be fequeftred from "his feat, be 'com
mitted, or held to bail. When this is done,.
a*Committe.G will be appointed to draw ar
ticles of impeachinfnt.
. The reason, Isn S. said, why forne steps
should be taken at prefeht was, that means
should be taken to secure lhp;pei)'on of the
offender, either by confinement or by baiL
since it was tfie op in La of the law ofli;*ert.
of Government that' he could not be arrest
ed by ordinary proceis. He could not be;'
arretted by the Senate ; they could fend
for him (as he imderftocd they had done)
by the Sergeant at Arms, to take his feat
in the House but when the House ad- â
journcd, they had no further power over
him, until an impeachment was made against '
him.
Gentlemen said there was no danger cf
escape. If it were not improper to ft ate
what hpd taken place out of doors, it might
be said, tkat there had already been an at
tempt at an escape. Besides, if no investi
gation were now to take place, how were
they to come to a knowledge of the plot
which gentlemen seemed so desirous to come
to a knowledge of. When they had deter
mined to make the impeachment, and an
oral declaration was made of it to the Se
nate, when they were reacjy to go home, â
they might go, and exhibit the charges, a,t
the next session, when they should have had
leisure fully to consider the fubjecL
Mr. Rutledge had no dpubt in his'mind
on the fybjeft ; but he thought it necessary
that the hand writing of Mr. Blount ihould
be proved.He had himielf attendi-fl the
tnfU.oF ail Impeachment which had excited"
th{Â£attention of the world (he alluded to the
trial of Mr. Hastings) and the order of pro
ceeding was as has been stated. He moved
that evidence betaken of the hand-writing..
The Chairman suggested tht; propriety
of having the bufmefs done in the house.
Mr. Brookes fa;d, Jie should not have
fpokenon the occasion, if he had not heard
gentlemen express wishes to the prefect
fubjeft postponed. For his part, he could
npt tell how gentlemen would be able to ac
quit thetnfelves to their own conferences and
to their conflituents, if they, should refufe to
stay a-day or two to do this business..
Mr. Venable said, that as this was a new
cafe, and, would'be referred to as a prece
dent, they should attend to the form of
their proceedings. He thought the firft
ftep should be to prove the letter. If the
[ committee could not do it, he should wish
the Committee to rife, that it might.be done
' in the house. He did riot think tfodr de
r termination should be postponed ; byt, that
1 if an impeachment was to be entered upon,- 1
1 that it should now be done. lie hid po
" doubt of the truth of the letter ; tut lie
wished it to be duly as hereafter' a
e cafe might occur, in which such a letter
; might be a forgery.
s Mr; Nicholas said, that fo'me gentlemen
'" had spoken upon this question, as if there â 
1 were persons upon the committee who w.'fh
â¢" ed to exfulpate the perfoa charged [Mr
" Sitgreaves declared, if he was alluded to,
2 tliat he had no such intentjofc,} Mr. N.
h thought he intimated something of the ki id
when he said gentlemen ventured to fay r &c.
lC No member of that committee, he trufled,,
* would wish to screen the offender, and he
') believed no person less than he who_ was.
' c nearly connected with him (meaning,' we
11 suppose, his brother Thomas Blpimt). Mr.
h N. thought it was not fufficieni that the
r President had sent them a letter, which he
a believed to be the hand-writing of William
Blount. If they were to take- this for
h granted, they gave their power gf judging
n over to the President.
16 Mr. N. said he had merely enquired what
ie * would be the confequSnces of a poftppne
ie ment to the next session. He did not think
it could produce any bad effett, qs if the
*" offender were to escape, the final punifhmant
ie did not require the preface, of the man.-
3 > Mr. N. again exprefled his doubt, about the
y constitutionality of the proceeding.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) said he Held
n in his" hand a letter, which he had received
l " from the President of the United-States, la-,
d scribed as an original letter of William
Blount, to be preserved with care; If aay .
member of the committee will fay that lie
d believes the writing to be 'the writipg of
William Blount, it might the save the trou
~ ble of the committee's riling for the pur
pose of having the fact ascertained in the
1_ house.
Mr. Harper thought the committee
11 were as well fatisned as to the fad now, as
they could be when the hand-writing was
proved ; but he denied that the committee
x " had the power of taking evidence of this*
kind. He moved for the committee to rife,
either to examine evidence, or to adjourn.
Mr. Gai.latin wished the-committee to
1 " rife ; but, before it rose, he wished to men
n~ tion two or three ideas, upon which he
x " should wish to have fatisfaction when the
committee Jat again.
: a j So far as relates to the conflitutional que'f
,as tion,' the gentleman frcm Connecticut fMr.
j t Dana) -had" removed a part of his doubts ;
cc therefore, what he fltould mention would
to not relate to that point.
as If he rightly understood his colleague,
re- when speaking of the opinion of gentlemen
he of the law, he said that their opinion was,
:er not only that William Blount was liable to
>er an impeachment, but that the proper mode
of prosecuting him was by impeachmefit.
He had since looked at the opinion, and did
try not find it so ; but that he was liable to im
ste peachment. In jtie -next place, he uiider
as itood him to fay, that Mr. Blount was not
aid amenable to orderly process. He wished to
ine know whether this id& was well-founded,Â«'â¢Â« whether the only mo3s :n \vnich he
c vdd Jc prosecuted was by impeachment.
He wished to know this that he might re
gulate his proceedings accordingly. Hi*
\vil!u\i the business to be gone -into as fully
Â«'T poflible ; and he truiicd that this mode of
httpeacLmertt was not thrown upon them in
Â«ir<Vr to prevent the bringing of the subject
Before a court of juflice, and by means
funprefs the inquiry which- he wished to
j.roTeciite. He thought an inzeftigatio'ti of
the plot was of far greater consequence than
the impeachment and of an
individual. If the profeeution and the in-,
quiry were to go on together, it would be
well ; but Ke wished to know whether, if
they entered upon the impeachment, it was
the design to drop every other mode of pro
ceeding.
Mr. M'Dowell hoped' the committee
would not rife for the purpose of proving
the hand-writing of Mr. Blount. He was
acquainted with his writing, and believed it
to be his. As he had this belief, he wished
to come to a determination as soon as pofli
ble. He thought the design a very criminal
one, as it went not only to dellroy the peace
and happiness of this country, but also of
others. He trusted, therefore, that they
fliould take such iteps as should prevent fo
reign mimfters in future from engaging per
ibns to carry into effeft views of this kind.
Mr. Harper wished the committee to
rife'. If the gentleman from Pennsylvania
had known any thing of the. law, he mud
have known, that the courts of justice were
wholly inadequate to the inquiries he had
mentioned. He did not believe this offence
was punifhabte in any other way than by
impeachment. Mr. H. faife it was at pre
sent unnecessary to fay any thing about any
other persons being implicated in this bufi
refs ; he believed gentlemen might as well j
fpait their infinuatfons until they were bet- j
ter acquainted with the fubjecl. He be-
JieVenf flrfan th.>y Vnd rsnd.rhr papers, gen
tlemen AÂ«.ould be convinced the charges
brought against the British minifler were
unfounded. V '
Mr. Brookes wished to know <vhether
they could proceed to impeach a man if he
prefent.
Mr. 1)A vA said, when this fubjeft was
under debate with closed doors, the secreta
ry of slate was present, and when it was
doubted whether the publication of these
papers might impede the profeeution of ah
inquiry into the business, they were informed
by him that such Reps were taken as that"
the publication of the papers could not have
a bad effeft.
The committee rose, and obtained leave
to fit again.
It was proposed that the Speaker should
proceed to take evidence as to the hand
writing of the letter of William Blount.
The Speaker suggested tTie propriety of I
calling in a magistrate, as he had no power
to administer an oath, except in the cafq of
, qualifying the members of that house.
Mr. Lyon moved that the Speaker be
authorised to administer an oath On this oc
casion.
The question wa3 put and negatived 53
to 29.
Judge Keene, in the mean time coming
into the house, a motion was made and car
ried, that he be requested to admipifter the
oath to Messrs. Macon, M'Dowell, .Grove,
and Baldwin, which was accordinoly done,
and they gave their teftimoney as to the re*
ality of the hand-writing as stated yesterday.
FRIDAY, JULY 7.
Mr. D. Foster moved a resolution for"
an adjournment on Monday.
Mr. Havens moved to amend the reso
lution by infecting Saturday. '
This amendment, after some cqnverfation,
was negatived jo to 23, and the original
rpo'tion was carried without a division.
The order of the day was moved on the
bill for the relief of major Thomas Lewis.
The house went into a committee on the
fubjeft, and reported the bill without a
mendment. It was ordered to be engrofTed
for a third reading, yhich it afterwards re
ceived and paiTed.
Mr. Sitcreaves moved to go into a
committee of the whole on the report of the
committee on the confidential communica
tion of the Prefiden't of the United States on
Monday last.
The Speaker said, before the house went
into a committee of the whole on this fub
jetl, he would read a letter which he had
just received. He read a letter from Tho
mas Blount, requesting to be excused from
voting on the question which so nearly con
cerned his brother.
He was excused.
The house then went into a committee
of the whole on the resolution yesterday re
ported, proposing an impeachment of Wil
liam Blount, when it was agreed to without
debate or division. The house took up the
resolution, and also agreed to it in fame
way.
Mr. Sitcreaves moved, " that a mem
ber go to the Senate, and at the bar of that
house impeach William Blount, in the name
of this houfej and of all the people of the
United States, and to inform them that they
will, in due time, exhibit articles of impeach
ment against him, and make good the
fame."
Mr. Gallati v said, he was not well ac
quainted with the business ; but he; did not
think it would be right to on and im
peach at once;, before they saw what articles
of impeachment were to be preferred. He
thought it would be best firft to appoint a
committee to prepare the articles of im
peachment, and present them to the Senate,
at the fame time that they sent them their
determination to impeach.
Mr. Sitgkeates said, that, the mode
which he proposed, was the fame which was ]
praftifed in the cafe of Mr. Hailings. Mr. 1
Burke went up to the house of Lords and ;
impeached him in words similar to those now 1
proposed to be used. Some time afterwards 1
the articles of impeachment having been 1
drawn, Mr. Burke went up to the 1
house of Lords and exhibited them. Mr.
â  3. spoke itflb of a work lately publifheci, ill
, continuation or judge Blackftone's Com
mentaries, which had a chapter on parlia
mentary impeachment, and pointed out
this as the proper mode of proceedure. He
had also looked into the proceedings on the
i trial of the earl of Macclesfield, and found
: the fame course was taken. It was true,
1 that in the cafe of a public officer of the
1 state of Pennfylvar.ia, which perhaps his
colleague might have in his eye, the articles
of impeachment were exhibited at the fame
1 time that the impeachment was made.
Mr. S. thought, however, that there was
: a good reason for not doing more at this
time. If a Committee were to be appoint
i ed to prepare the fpecific charges against
â¢ Mr. Blount, it would create considerable
delay, and it wCmld be proper that rmmedi
: ate measures should be taken, in order to
; secure the person of Mr. Blount. Besides,
i at present, the only evidence of this myfte
: ; rious business, was the letter of Mr. Blount.
1 Measures were taken to procure further evi
â¢ dence ; but it could not be got till some
time hence. When this was got, it might
| considerably develope the plot. At present,
every thing, was conjecture. In every point
of view, therefore, he thought it would be
best to observe the usual mode of proceed
ing in similar cases.
Mr. Gal latin said, if his memory was
right, all the fpecific charges brought a
gainst Warren Hafttngs, were firft agreed to
by the House of Commons, before impeach
ment was made.
There was one thing, however, fell from
his colleague, which would seem to make
the mode proposed desirable. Mr. G. said
he had considered the question which had
been agreed to as a mere question of form,
and that thev fhou'/l have, gone on to exhi
| bit articles of impeachment; but it appear
j ed from what had fallen from his colleague,
that the articles of impeachment were not
intended to be exhibited till next feflion.â
If this were the cafe, he thought it was per
fectly righ* in wifliing to present the im
peachment in general terms. Till now he
thought it had been the intention to have
gone further.
Mr. Harper believed it would not be
proper for the House to stop in the present
stage of their proceeding. He thought
the proper mode of* doing the business was
that recommended by Mr. Sitgreaves.â
Having come to a resolution to impeach,
the Senate should be immediately .informed
thereof, as they could then take measures
accordingly. It was not necessary at the
fame time to exhibit the particular charges.
They might afterwards determine whether
they would exhibit the fpecific articles of
charge during this feflion, or at the next.â
He thought the charge might now be made ;j
and if any additional fa&s appeared before
the next feflion, which might make addi
tional charges necessary, they might then
be made.
Mr. Sitcreaves believed his colleague
might be right with respect to what took
place on the trial of Mr. Hastings. He
had not the particulars of the parliamentary
proceedings on that business before him.â
He had those in the cafe of the Earl of
Macclesfield, which were as he had stated.
All that he contended for was, that having
taken the resolution to impeach, it becartie
necessary, of course, that the resolution
should be communicated to the Senate. In
no instance had the articles of impeachment
attended the oral communication. After
it had been made, the House could deter
mine whether th*. fpecific articles should be
drawn now, or at the next feflion.
Mr. Go.idok said, there might be differ
ent modes adopted in cases where the per
sons accused were not members of the Le
gislature. In the cafe of lord StraffordÂ»he
recolle&ed, that in half an hour after the
vote pafftd resolving to impeach him, he
was taken into execution.
The question was put and carried with
out a division.
Mr. Sitcreaves proposed also the fol
lowing : " That the said member do demand
that the said William Blount be sequestered
from his feat in the Senate, and they
take order for his appearance to answer to
the charges which be exhibited against
him."
Mr. Venable thought they had gone
far enough, and .that they should leave it to
the Senate to take such measures as they
should think proper with respect to displa
cing their member from his feat. If the re
solution were, however, adopted, he wished
the word suspended might be used rather
than fcqiuliercd.
Mr. Sitgreaves thought the word fy
nonimous. He had used fcqucjlercd, because
he found the word used in the books.
Mr. Harper thought the motion right
in substance ; for though the Senate had
the power of displacing their member from
his feat ; yet the talcing order for his ap
pearance to answer the charges brought
against him, should be done from the appli
cation of the prosecutor, as in ordinary ca
ses.
Mr. Sew all thought that each House
was the best judge of the condutt of. its
own members, and to require the sequestra
tion of Mr. Blount from his feat was not
necessary. He believed the Senate were at
that moment taking measures for expelling
him from-his feat, any interference of theirs
on that fubieÂ£t was therefore wholly unne
eeffary.
Mr. Nicholas was of opinion that in
following tpo closely the practice of Great
Britain with refpeft to impeachment, they
should be lead astray, as the punishment con
sequent upon the eonvi&iou of an offender
was very different in the two countries. In
Britain, an offence might reach the life of a
person, whereas in this country, the extent
of the punishment, was removal from office,
a,nd difqualification for the future. For his
own part, therefore, lie did not fee any oc
casion for confinement of the person, ex
cept it were necessary to examine him by in
terrogatory.
Mr. Harper said it was certainly nreef.
. fary tf) fecurc th-- of the' cS'or.der,
otherwise he coult? n.ot.W b.oxigiit to trial â¢
since it was a maxim jh \.t to be d"p/irte.d
from that a pcrfon cou'd not be tried.in his
absence. "
Mr. Sitgreates was of rhe fame opi
nion.
Mr. Venable agreed with Mr. Nicholas,
that the difference of punilhment cor.fcquent
upi.-n trials by impeachment was pot fuffi
ciently attended to. He did not think that
the doftrine was founded, that a man could
| not be tried in his absence. It would be
an unfortunate conclnlion, that effectual
Iprocefs could not be had a man bc
caufe he was absent.
Mr. Kittera said the gentleman last up
was certainly mistaken in faying that a man
might be tried in his absence.
it would be belt to purftle the usual mode
on similar occaiions.
Mr. Gordon infifled upon the right
which that houte had to require the Senate
to sequestrate Mr. Blount from his feat, and
that they should hold him to answer the char
ges toÂ» be exhibited again ft him. If this
were not the cafe an offender might go on
so execute his purposes to the great injury
of the country, before, he was expelled from
his feat or held to bail.
Mr. Sewall had no idea that it was ne
cessary to fequefler Mr. Blount from his feat
in order to hold him to appear to the char
ges to be exhibited against him ; though he
conceived it necessary to hfrld him to bail,
as no trial could take place except he was
present.
This proposition was put and carried 41
to 30.
Mr, Sitgreaves was appointed to >vait
upon the Senate, to carry into effect the a
bove proposition. t
The Speaker read a note which he had re
ceived from a member of the Senate inform
ing him that feats were prepared sos- the
reception of the members of that hcufe, in
cafe they chose to atteni} the business then
before the Senate [which war the question
for expelling Mr. Blount from his feat, op
posed by the cou'nfel of Mr. Blount, viz.
Messrs. Dallas and Ingerfol. J
Mr. Dent moved that when the house
adjourn, it adjourn till two o'clock. A
greed, and the house adjourned about 12
o'clock, and attended the Senate.
At two o'clock the house re-rffumed its
fitting ; and after Mr. Sitgreaves had made
a report of his cojnmiffion to the Senate, the
house resolved itfelf into a committee of the
whole 011 Algerine.bufinefs, and the galle
ries were closed for the remainder of the
fitting.
Saturday, Jnly 8.
A message was received from the Senate,
informing the house that they had agreed to
their amendment to the appropriation bill;
and that they had in confequehce of their im
peachment of William Blount, a Senator of
United States, proceeded to hold him
to bail to appear to the charges to be exhi
bited against Kim, himfelf in 20,000 dollars,
and two sureties each in 15,000 dollars.
By mefTages from the President of the
United States to the two houses it appears
that he has approved and sighed thfc aft for
laying a stamp duty on parchment, vellum
and paper : also the aft allowing full mileage
to the members of the two houses ; the aft
concerning consuls and vice-consuls ; and
the aft to continue in force an aft authori
sing the transfer of the flock Handing to
the credit of certain dates.
On motion of Mr. Macon, the commit
tee of the whole to whom was referred the
bill authorising the President of the United
Statesduring the recess of Congress, to pro
vide armed gallies, was discharged.
Mr. Harper said it would be recolleft
ed that he had laid two rcfolMions on the
table relative to the securing of live oak timr
ber, &cÂ» From the press of business, which
had been continually before the house, he
had not had an opportunity of calling them
up ; and the session being now too far ad
vanced, he gave notice that he should bring
forward the fubjeft early in the next session.
Mr. Holmes fajd that he thought it ne
cefTary, in order to enforce a general com
pliance with the Jaws of the United States,
that they should be printed in the German
language, aÂ« wejl a? in the Â£nglifh, since
there were very many of the inhabitants of
this country who could read no other. He
therefore proppfed a resolution to the fol
lowing effeft:
Resolved by the Senate and House of Re
presentatives of the United States, that a
number of copies of the laws of this session,
not exceeding 8,000 copies, shall be printed
in the German language, and distributed by
the Secretary of State among the Executives
of the several states, for the information of
the German inhabitants of each state ref
peftively.''
Mr. Lyon thought it would be proper
to pass a resolution of this kind. He did
not know what number might be necessary.
He also thought that some meal'ures should
be taken for a general publication of their
laws in the English language ; at present,
it was mewly. by chance if the people in his
diilrift came to a knowledge of them. He
thought.all laws of general import should be
inserted in every newspaper throughout the
Union.
Mr. Coit said, if they were to promulge
their laws in the Geimaji language/-, it would
be necessary that they should all become cri
tically acquainted with",it, for; if they were
to autliorife any tranflativd, great mifchiefs
would arise from its not being correft.
Mr. Gallatin said, that the weight
of the objeftions urged by the gentlemen last â¢
up had always been thought fufficient in the r
Legislature of Pennsylvania, in which state
there was a greater proportion of Germans <
than in any other. There was also another
objeftion to the measure. If it were to be
passed, it must be accompanied with an ap
propriation law which the advanced state of
the session would not admit.
The resolution was put and negatived.
Mr. Sitgreaves proposed the follow
ing resolution to the house :
! " Resolved, thlt a Committee be appoint
! to prepare and report articlesof impeach
ment against IVilliam Blount, a Senator of
the United States impeached by this house
of High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and that
the fame Committee have power to fit du
ring the-recefs of Congress, and to fend for
persons, papers and records." \
Mr. Gal latin wished a division of the
resolution at the word ml/demeanors.
The firft part was then put and carried.
Mr. Gallatin defiredthe determination
on the second pirt to be postponed till Mon
day. It was a new fubjeft, and he wished
a little time to colder of it. The com
mittee he supposed could in the mean time
be appointed.
Mr. Brookes enquired whether the lat
ter part of the resolution for fending for
" persons, papers and records," should not
be connected with the fxrfl part of the reso
lution.
Mr. Venable said the gentleman last
up might be accommodated by adding the
words in question ; and if, before they ad
journed, it was found necessary that thecom
hiittee should have power to fit during the
recess, that power could be given to them.
Mr. 3itgreaves did not think it would
be proper to pass one part of the resolution
without the other. The house had resolved
to adjourn 011 Monday, and there was little
doubt that the other branch of the legisla
ture would agree to it. If the committee
should be appointed to report articles of Im
peachment at this session, it wouljJ be found
that it would require more time than he be
lieved Congress would be inclined to give to
it : for if prepared, they must also be exhi
bited ; and if exhibited the Senate. wcÂ«ild
think it necessary to proceed to aft upon
them. In this View of the fubjeft, great ad
vantage might arise from the committees
having" leisure to pursue enquiry into the
plan, so as to devclope the mifchkf during
the recess of Congress.
Mr. Venable said the objeft of gentle-
JTien feeined to be mistaken- They wished
merely to jiave a little time to consider of the
fubjeft. He had doubts whether it was in
the power of the house to authorize a
committee to fit during the recess.
Mr. Siegreaves did not wish to hurry
the business.
Mr. Rutledge had no objeftion to de
ferring the vote till Monday ; but he tho't
it absolutely neceflary to empower the com
mittee to fit during the recess. This was
according to British precedent. It was the
plan also upon which two different impeach
ments had been condufted in the State of
South Carolina. He thought the reason in
this cafe very ltrong ; the objeft was not on
ly to bring the charge home to the person
impeached, but to bring forward all the
persons concerned in this plot. Indeed the
articles of impeachment must be founded, in
a great measure, on information which was
to be difcovcred by this inveftigatiÂ»n. He
trusted, therefore that this power wonld be
given. '
Mr. Gallatin said he was in no want
of precedent on this occaiion. He was a
member of a committee of impeachment in
the state of Pennsylvania, where fimihir mea
sures were adopted ; but he was of opinion
that thishufinefs had bean already too much
hurried, and that some of the lleps taken
would have been better taken, if they had
had more time. He wiihed, therefore, to
consider upon this propolition till Monday.
Gentlemen who brought forward the mea
sure were doubtless ready to vote for it ; but
he trusted they would allow others a little
time. j
Mr. M'Dowell wished a committee to
be immediately appointed, and the charges
made, because there might be at present
persons in the city, wbo could not be exa
mined during the recess of Congress.
The words " to fend for persons, papers
and records," were to be added to the form
er part of the resolution, and the latter .part :
was postponed till Monday.
Meffrs.Sitgreaves,Baldwin,Dawlon,Dana
and Harper were appointed a committee for
preparing the articles of impeachment.
Mr. Harper said, that though he did
; not intend to bring forward the fubjeft of
purchasing timber, andproviding naval yards
thiÂ» felfion, he wished the house to enter in
to a resolution which he thought would be
proper in the mean time. He offered one
to the following effeft :
" Resolved that the President of the U
nited States be requested to profecuteÂ«and
cause to be laid before this house, early in
the next session, information refpeftiug such
land furnifhed with live oak timber, as may
bepurchafed for the use ofthe United States,
and also of such timber as may be purchased.

profpe&s of appreciating their property :

ed by any on the continent.
3. Besides numerousfprings and runs, of the fin
ed quality, there is a creek for water works (on

and nearer than any Other rout, rtiuft become uni
versally travelled 1 aided by the navigation of Ju
niata and Conemaugh, goods may be c* at
. lead 2 or 3 dollars per ewt. cheaper from the for
mer to latter place, than by the old road .thro'
Bedford.
5. Eeing in the centre of a flourilhing fcttle
ment, and taking in the Ihorted portage between
the eadern and western waters, it is likely to be
come a depolit for dores, a manufacturing town,
and a feat df juftiee. Besides the old settlers, up
wards,of one hundred emigrants have fettled in the
vicinity of Beula, since lad Oikober, and many
more have engaged to join them this summer.

with farms to a considerable amount, and in vari
ous situations, will be immediately opened in the

cent country act felicited to fend their drafts and
terras of sale, or lealing, to Thomas Jones, Sur
veyor, in Beula, who will give security for any

.the progress of (he settlement wii( be the more ra
pidly advapccd and extended to didant towpfhips.
7. A public library for the benefit of the feÂ«lers,
will be edablifhed in the town, towards hying the
foundation of which, upwards of Â»Â»o liwuf.inJ

8. Two hundred acres of land adjoining the
town, besides lots and fpbfcriptiops;will be applied
to support a minister and preceptor, capible of
