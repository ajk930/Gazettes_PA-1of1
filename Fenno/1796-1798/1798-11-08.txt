turn away eurjutt wrath ; when that is allayed
under the matk of iriendlhip, renew the old
Icheme to divide and govern. We deferv'e
chains if we accept thsm again.
r '1 he Irish pitriots, after having set their own
- country entire, are running away by the light
of it, as wharf rats are said lo flee in troops
from one haufc where they have been baited
With rats bane, to another where they smell

fame of America to be the home, the Jerufaiem,
tor runaways. What fort of society (hall wÂ®
have -ho v (ball we be made up by the timÂ«
that diftrailed Europe gets fettled. All that
other States throw away we are to take, and fay '
. thank you. Their offal is to be our aliment.â
We are tofwellour pt pulatiou with the four lea
ven of Ireland, and the caustic spirit of France,
The witches cauldron, in the play of Macbeth,
was not filled with worfc ingredients Iban Ame
rica will be. Surely we need a Sedition lav to
keep our own rogues from cutting our throats,
snd an Alien law to prevent the iavafion hr a
hf.fl of foreign rogues to a (Tift them. Th# ir
ruption of the Goths and Vandals into the Ro
man Empire did not more seriously threaten it*
overthrow than the terrible preference all fo
rtign incendiaries indulge for our happy coun
try ; it lorebodes confulien and whitky irifur
reaion. France and Great Britain use Ameri
ca very I'curvily when they presume to make it a
Botany Bay for their convifis. a bettering house
for their knaves, and a bedlam for mad peeple.
The New-England states will hang tome of
rhem, and others Pennfylvank will feed to
Congreti.
It feenr\s as if America was already a di
vided people. The jacobin party has iti
ttnnifter in Paris, and ht is accredited by the
direftory ; probably inftcad of paying for
that houor, lie has iponey to take, and some
of it may be employed perhsp* to pay Ly
en's tine. As the pÂ»rty thus exercise tht

r| he zeal; d'fperation and energy of the
jacobins is ever greatest, when they are mod
in Late eve at?, far from convert
ing thtm have (harper.ed their paflions into
ten fold rage They long to retaliate upon
Honest men, friends of government, the con
tempt hat blisters add scalds their own re
putations. The common of all
jdeobius too unites them the more closely
together, and gives to the party the power
of a&ing in mass. To despise the force of
one's enemy is ever deemed unwise and raflÂ«.
Let Federalip look to it, that the foes of
all good order do not profit by their lu
pineuefs at the election. With a jacobin
congress, eur liberty and independence
would not live to celebrate another fourth
of July.
American spirit is much admired in Eu
rope ; and It has done more to Jifgrace tiie <
mock rrpublicanifm of the French, than any I
event fir.ee that bloody revolution began its, 1
work of dca-h. If however Talleyrand's 1
lullaby, jhould firft disarm, and then divide
the pc; pie, Europeans will fay. prrhaps we 1
are not cowards but furelywe .re fools â
The very fame game was played by France
against Switzerland. France encroached,
and when (he Swi.fs resented it (he conceded. 1
Then lulled them asleep again, encroached '
ence more, hired a party in their public
Councils, such a partv as (hehas in Congress,
and then Switzerland waked up, bleeding,
plundued and in chai s. Talleyrand is like
a cat, he retires f*'m the hole to e cut
rage the mouse to c .me out, x:;d already he
arranges his bloody paws to spring upon us.
There is a vagabond Ir'i/hm-.n, or Scotch
man, in the third parifli of D.dman, who
has flirted i.p a few ignorant people to er
a liberty pole, with a painted board, and j
the words Liberty, Equality, no Stamp aS, j
no Sedition or Alien bill, downfall to tyranny |
of America, peace and retirement, long live the
Vice Prrjident and minorityâmay moral vir
tue be the basis of civil Government.
Mary of the justices of the peace, on their
way to attend the felfions, had opportunity
to behold this standard of infiirre&ion a
gainst the laws and magillracy of the
country.
Arming our country has not kindled the
open anger of France, and produced that
dreadful war the croaking jacobins forebod.
ed. On rhe contrary, it has foftened our
ci-devant ally, while cur coaxing, and tears
ami fybmiflions did but irritate her. O, the

the French ambafladorat Berlin, before the
arrival ofSieyes, had been invited to court
with great etiquette. After dinner a pack
of cards wasprefcnfcd to the coufnt de Gortz
governor of Berlin, in OTder to make a par
ty wi'h the French minister. Th: Prtifltan
knoA> ing it wasintended he (hotald play with
Caillard, had the info'ence to fay to the
chamberlain of the court, loud enough for
the ki-g to hear him-" Sir, Ido not play 3
w.ih a Plebeian." The king ioSantly said
to lum, " my dear Gortz, your carria/e is
in waiting for you below ; I shall get ano

was obliged to retire at the instant.

PHILADELPHIA,
THURSDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 8.
End of the Century.
s I cannot agree with Mr. Cobbett, that
the ".latter i:i dispute, is of a trilling nature,
- âsince uulefs some decision can be had, â 1
1 fume conviction worked in the mindi of the
a i rtinety-nitie-men, the dispute threatens to
3 j result ir\ very great of dates and
l calculations. As Mr. Cobijett, however,
; j his declared hiinfelf on the occafioti, it is
â¢- to be hopvd we (hall have some thing ration
d al .offer.-d in support of opinions, which now
I appear like the confufed dreams of a diftem
i- pered imagination, to support which no
> thing has hitherto been offered but mifcoa
) ception, noise and fury, and which induced
me to apply this passage from Horace.
... ; " Credite, P.fonts, illi tabulae foie librurn
( j Perlimilem, aijus, veiul iomnia, van*
| Fiojentur species."
I Which I beg the reader to substitute for
y the imperfect and erroneous quotation iufert
?Â» ed in Tuesday's Gazette,
ir
It appears that the New-York citizenef*
y like our cinzentfs, has her bully, who hid
ing himfelf behind her petticoats, pours

MR. TENNO,
ie An Editor, eminent for acuterefs of pe
ce netrafion, contends that the Eighteenth
a- Century ends with the year 1709. I pre
tend not to any depth of re earch on this
; fubjeÂ£t, altho' it is a topic of fevcral years
ie (landing ; yet I think the decision I have
made on this-poiot inevitable, and resulting
h from very Ample and very obvious principles,
h I will aik, what is a century ? The
complete period of an hundred years, and or
y course not ninety-nine, which wants one of
1- it. To render this period complete, or in
ie other words to campafe this cejitury, the
la ft year and the firft are as essential com
ponent parts as any'mtermediare years ; and
e I will ask if the dogma against wh ch I con-
j e tend does not go to the entire abolition of
I the centurial or hundieth year, which is
no longer the hundredth or clcfing year of
tjie century, upon this principle, but the
commencement or firft year of the new cen
e tury. The following simple course Â»fnum
e bi rs throws some light on the fubjedt :
1 3 34 â56 â78 â9 âie â11âu
Here it will be feen r that, though we no
minate an hour not until it has past or gone
_ by, whereas we speak ef a year, while pend
v, '"Â£â¢ ( a difference founded on custom, but
naturally arising from the.long duration of
the latter) yet in either cafe, and I maintain,
ln every other which can be imagined, nei
ther the firft nor the last member of the
tarm can be difpenftd with, or other wife
dilpofed of, than in the hitherto accustomed
order.
m From the beginning of year 1, to the end
of year 99, is still bin ninety-nine years,
nor can it, I think, .be made out more, by
* a" wit of Mr. Cobbett or all the sophis
try of h s eorrefpondent.
I have something more to offer on the
r fubjeiit, which other occupations preclude
at present ; ar.i which, I have the v.inity
'â¢ to believe, far,aior*d by several unqueflionÂ« .
' ble authorities which will he adduced in
j.' Support of my opinion, rnuft work convic-
I t{ , oa io th e mind of Mr. Cobbett, and all
his cofrefpondents. CERTO.

Mr. Cobbtt,
In your paper cf last Saturday, Mr. T.
VV. has afÃrted that " th- motaent Ave be
gan to date 1798, then were 1798 years
pad." I would alk this politive Mr. T. W.
it whether November was past the moment we>
begin to date N. ?âHe fays, he
, " could bring forward in support of his af
c fertion many arguments." But he has
0 brought forward none.
Had a tranfadtidn been recorded fix
r months after the comme'i>cemeflt of the firft
century, what year mult it have been dated
in? Certainly in the year one, although that .
year was uot then completed. And if the
firft yeat- wa3 completed on the last of De
) cember io the year one ,as has been obferv-
3 _ ed, the firft hundred years tsuft have been
j completed on the last of December iu the
year ico : and consequently the eighteenth I
century mud be completed on the last of i 1
December, 1800- j'
When Mr. T. W. makes an assertion, he !
> r oug'it to produce some argument to sup j
t- port it ; and when he commen's on the o- '
pinion of others, if he cliufes to do it iu an ~!
unmannerly style, I shall fwppofe it is t at
h which he has been most accuftomcd to.

PROPOSALS,
BY THI
Insurance Company qf North Arv erica.
For Insurance againll Fiiii, on D.vclling-
HouseÂ», Ware-Houses, and other Buildings (and
on Gooi!< contained in such Buildings) did ant from
Philadelphia, in the United States.
I. Commcn lufuraneef, on hazards of the firft
daft, will be undertaken at a promium of ahout
bah per cut, per annijm. For excra Naxardons
rifqnes a larger premium will he required, which
wi!l vaiy accor ling to circumftanceg, fsideai ex
teeding or; per rent, per annum ; but in some in-
Minces, where rhe property insured i* not only in
itfelf extra hszardous, but rendered still more so
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and
occupations, the premium demanded will be raised
according to circumftanees.
Houses and Ware-Houfcs, thewÂ»ll* and peti
tions of wf ic-h are wholly of (lone or trick, well
conllruiSed, so as to bÂ» guarded as well as may be
ageinft fires from w'uhin, and free from extra ha
zardous buildings and <>cccupations in their neigh
borhood, will be deemed hazardous of the firft
clafÂ«, and may he insured to their full valne.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not o an extra
hazardcuE kind, in calks. bales, or paokagM, 4e
pofircd in fli'ch buildings, to an amount rot ex
cee -nig 4000 dollars; but if more than this fun
required to be insured in one tenement, an addi; 1
tional premium wiU ha required, in proportion to
circumstances.
11. Infuranres will also be macfe on buildings ami
gooii- extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to tbo rifque'. But it is "ot e:,fy to arrange these
under pnrncular heads rr cla(Tes, so as to defciibe
each wirhrh' necelTary accuracy. Each cafo mnlt
therefore he decided upon according to the circum
ftancej a tending it ; and these circumflances >vili,
in general, appear frum the ckfcription accompa
nying tleapplication.
Buildings partly conftruiflcd of brick or (lone, â 
r.rc preferable to those wholly wooder. And in
both cases, tiie itile'of building, how they are oc
fup; 1, haw they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, andhow occupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And with to goods,
rhe:v ttndsncy, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, either
to com. nee or to increase an accidental fire, and
their liability in such state to receive damage by [
tvet, or by sudden and haf.y removal, or to be fto- c
kn in time of confufion and hurry, are all rir- e
cumflances of weight; atad the premiums mufl kc t
proportioned accordingly. .
111. The following conditiont UPe to be under- ,
flood by the parties. ,
ill. The Insurance is not binding till the ftipu- e
latsd premium be raid ; but it (hall be deemÂ»d ef- v
fedlual irom the time of such payment and accept ''
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately 0
Cgnedornot, e
2(i. Insurances may be renewed at the expira- 0
tiou of the term of the policy, without further ex- il
penfes than the payment of thÂ« premium of the re
newed term, the eircumftances continuing the fame
as they were utidcrftood by the Infurcrs attfre time "~
the former insurance was made ; but the payment
of t!iÂ« premium is efTential to such renewal; and "]
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time; nor can the insurance be renew
ed on the former policy but by cotnputfng the
commencement of the renewal from the expiration
of the former insurance. The lubjeil of insur
ance may neVerthclefs be open to treaty for a new
iulr.rar.ee.
3d. If any other insurance be madeon the fame
property ; it mull be made known at the time of
application, orherwife the policy made on such ap
plication will be void.
4th Goods held in trull, or on consignment,
may be insured as such in a separate policy ; but
ths) are not tabe considered as infuted etherwife. of
(th. This company will not be liable or accoun
table for any loss or damage occasioned by any for
eign invasion, orby wiy military or usurped force
cr by reason of any civil commotion; or occalion,
Â«d by gunpowder, aquafortis or other thing of th
like kind kept in the building, or amongst the pro-
perty insured.
6th. Bills of Exchange, Bonds and other Secti- ~r
rities, Title Dwds Money, Bank and ether pro- , 1
mifTery Notes, are not included in any insurance ; 1 So,
nor arc paintings, medals, jewels, gems, antique fiv

term than one year, nor for a longer term than fe- '
vein years. Persons choosing to insure fdr seven ter

be abated in like manner on an insurance for
three years.
Bth. Loffcs fuflained by fire en prof trty injured,
fhallbe paid iu thirty days after due prouf and li
