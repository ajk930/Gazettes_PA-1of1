I HAVE the honor of inclosing for the Prefi
dent of the United States, my report on the
State of the Mint, with the abttra&s referred to
therein.
With sentiments of esteem and refpeft,
1 remain,
Sir,
Your most obedient, and very
humble servant,

To the Secretary of State.
* â
The Director of the Mint of the United States,
refpettfu'.ly reports to the President of the United
Statfesori the (late of the Mintâ
THAT during the experience of twelve months,
he has turned his attention (as far at has been iÂ»
hispowe ) to the inilitution under his care. He
has seen, with regret, an opinion generally pre
vailing, that the eftablilhment is Hu-neceflarily ex
pensive, and less produ&ive than was rationally
txpe&ed by its advocates and friends.
The Director finding forne foundation for the
charge, has endeavoured to discover the cause, as
nothing appears in the general nature of the mfti
tution, to warrant the idea.
The ifTue of the enquiry is, that the extraordi
nary expeaces attending the Mint, are, in a great
meafnre, owing to its original plan and the prin
ciples 01 \rhich it was etiablifhed. Among others,
the whole coinage, including the refinement of the
precious metals, was directed by law to be executed
at the public expence, the depolitor being fully
indemnified ftom all charges whatever : On this
principle, not only the cliginal cost of the works,
and the falariet of the stated officers, fall en the
public ; birt also the whole amount of the work
manship, with the alloy, waftagc and contingent
sxpences.
The want of experimental knowledge in the
bufir.efs, at the Srft establishment of the Mint,
prevented any tolerable precise estimate of the cx
pences necefferily process; but soon
after the commencement of the Kwfinefa, it was
found impracticable to proceed with propriety,
unless an addition was made to the elhblilhment by
the appointment of a melter and refiner.
This important and neceflary officer, is not
krmwn in foreign Mints, as the p-ecious metals are
. there genÂ«rally deposited of the proper ftaadard, or
above it ; er they are purchased by the Mint, and !
become public property; there being profefiional
refiners and independent of the Mint, vvhofe business
it is to purify metals under standard ; but there
being 110 such artiils in this city who follow the
. business, it became indispensably neceflary to Exe
cute this service in the Mint.
This circumllance was not forefeen, or if fore
feen, was considered as included in the duties of
t the aflayer ; but the neceflKTy of so .essential aeheck j
1 on that officer, forbad this meaiure, had it been
1 othefwife practicable. This added eonfiderably to
' the annual expences of the Minr.
Formerly the Director' could not make any
' charge .for this process, aefcinft depositors ; the
! whole expence therefore fell 09 the public. Thus
on assaying one dopofit of about 96,000 oz. of lilver
bullion, it turned out near 24,0010 oz. under stand
ard; to refine which, it coli the United States
. upwards of 5001. so that the depositor peally gained
that sum, by bringing his bullion t<j the Mint.
This operated very unequally among the depelitois.
The citizen who brought bullion in this debased
' state, to the Mint, received a3 much co'in for the
standard silver therein, as h- whose bullion was
previously refined equal to the standard, and ready
. for coining at a very trifling expend.
AgainâThe inftit'utioa of the mint, without
any appropriation of capital, either to purchase
the precious metals in bullian, and anticipate psy
ments dueon deposits, or to coin for the public,
has been another caufc of considerable expence.
. Depending upon depositors alone for the precious
metals.it became neceflary for their encouragement
t and iatisfaflion to coin every depefit as soon as pof
, fible after it tame into the treasury of the mint, to
; prevent its remaining unproductive to the deposit*
s or ; by which mems the clippings and grains were
. obliged to be -melted and coined as they arose, of
-1 ten th'ee or four times for one deposit.
Tints the melting, refining and coihing one de
pcfit oi 20c oz. of silver, or 20 oz. of gold, would
cost the public as much as near 1000 oz. of either,
and a much cteater proportional wattage ; whereas
l | could the bullion be purchased foi the public at the
market price, and kept in the vaults till a large
t ; quantity might be coined at once, or a capital of
about ten thousand dollars be flowed to the mint,
so as to anticipate the payments to depositors,
without being obliged to an immediate coinage on
f every occasion, a very gieat public saving would
take place, not only as to the wastage, but in the
expenditure of the materials and labor used in the
process, oiid no injury done to the United- States,
bat mtlifloan of the tnuaey fur s (Wt time. In
a word, the drfferance would be qnuch the fame, as
between the wholel'ale merchant and the hiickfter.
This measure would also have a tendency to fix
the jTiice of bullion, and indemnify the public for
fomt-part ttf the expence v of coinage. The only
qucftion that would arile t3, whether, on the prin
ciple of economy, it would be a prudent measure
on the part of government ? Stippofe the exptnees
of coinage, incluJing wattage, tobe fixed at three
per centum to the depositor, while in foreign coun
tties'it colts nothing. The consequence would be,
that bullion in America, might vary its (.rice three
per cent, according to the balance of trade ; while
bullion in those ct-untries must be supposed invaria
ble in its pric*", let the balance Â»f trade (land at it
will. BulHim then, in those countries will always
be at the highest price it ever can be at in America,
since it is the price of coin { but in America it may
be three per cent. lower. If theiefore the.United
States, by coining, free of all expense, contribute
to keep the price of bullion higher than it is in
countries where the coinage is paid for, a volunta
ry expent-e is.created, of which there Gaii be no
jull rcafon to complain.
A representation of some of these difficulties,
with the dangerous fituatioH of the mint, for want
of protesting laws to fecurs the inliruments of
coinage, the metals and the cois, as also to prevent
counterfeits, has been heretofore jnade by the *01-
cersof the mint, without little other fuccels (.ban
a rcl'olution of Congress, enabling the dire&oMo
retain the cxpifnce of refining the precious metals
under (iandard ; but the waltage, alloy and coin
age, are (till dead charges on the public treasury.
While therefore this policy, on the whole, is
considered as beneficial to the United States, the
complaint againtt the mint for if* heavv -expences
to the public, are without solid foundation, as it
is impoffiblc to carry on an inflitution of this na-
under these eircuinftancet, and which requires
from 15 to 29 workmen and laborers to attend it,
without great expence. Add to this, that the al
loy of silver and copper, with the loss by neceflary
waltpge, must unavoidably rife to a coniiderable
annual amount.
But these and ether difficulties
attending an Infant inilitution, the late
great advance in the prices of materials and labor,
the aggregate expeoces of are greatly re
duced, either from the superior knowledge of the
persons employed, gained by experience, or frjom
new arrangements found to be more advantageous
than those made on the spur of the occasion. This
will appear mure evident, by a view of the pre
greffive reduction of the contingent expences in
the quarterly accounts rendered into the treasury
department, and it is hoped that there will be a
farther prbgreft in this dcfirable economy.
When theprefent diredtor entered upon the ad
ministration as the mint, there was no appropria
tion of money for the purchase of copper , for the
coinage of-cents. This he clearly fortfaw would
prove a fourceof farther expence, by often leaving
the workmen without employ. He made applica
tion to Congress by their eommittce, on (his fub
jett ; but all that was obtained was thirteen thou
sand dollars, which was coined into cents, and re
turned into the public treasury, or remitted for the
purchase of copper, before the rising of Congress
the latt spring. No farther appropriation was
made, till it was too late to procure the#rtecefTary
irr.poitaiton of copper for the I'ummer'i coinage,
whereby much time has been loft, and foms consi
derable expence of workmen has been added to the
fummsr's account.
It is now hoped, from the present arrangement,
no such inconvenience will "arise hereafter; but a
continual and ample supply as copper coinage be
produced adequate to the public wants.
As the laws relative to ihe Mint now ftartd, the of
ficers are obliged to pay to each depositor the coins,
aritingfrem hit deposit, fn ftri<st order, and to reserve
three pieces of coin trern each nufs ; yet no appropri
ation has been made to replace the reserves, or to make
good the waftape ; it is therefore impossible for the
officer* of the Mint to conjpiy with .he law j and the
depositors cjjmplain of being kept out of their property,
till provision is made ry Congrtfiifor their relief.
By a number of new half johannes brought ,to the
Mini for afiayiirg, said to have been coined in the Uni
ted States, it appears that J coinage for that purpose is
carried on in fomc slate in the Union, Some as these
are found to be under standard in their quality, and
between two and threepenny-weights less than their
true weight. These are fatfs which the Director
thinks it his duty tocommunicatcto the President.
From the various experiments made since the estab
lishment of the Mint, it is found unnecessary to make
ufc of silver in alloying oi gold, unless it is for the pur
pcÂ£-of beautifying the coin; in which cafa it (hoald
be composed at the proportion of one-third silver to
two thirds copper.
By the following abilraft of the bullion and coin re
ceived and issued from the Mint,-fince its firft eltablifh
rntnt, may be fee.-,, as well the nature of the deposits
mad;, as the coins returned to the Trcjfurer, and the
dates of the receipts aÂ£d issues to this day, with the
amount of the copper coinage.
From this it appears, that there is due for wastage.
during that period, the quantity of fifteen hundred and
ninety-nine ounces, fixtcen penny-weigkis and fifteen
grains, of silver, equal to eighteen hundred and forty
five dollars, ninety-five cents and five mills ; besides a
(icfirit of eight hirndred Jltid forty four ounces, fereu
teen penny-weights and five grains of silver, equal to
n'me hundred aild seventy-sour dollars, feventy-five
centiand sue mills; making in the whole two thou
faiid eight hundred and twenty dollars and l'eventy one
cents ; for which an appropriation ought to be made by
law to fatisfy a deficient deposit.
The Director thinks it neceflary to-mention, in ex
culpation of the former officer* of the Mint, that by a
report made on this l"ubje&, it appears that there is yet
conliderable quantity of old pots arid telt bottoms,
from which it it expefled (hat Nearly the amount of the
deficient silver, as stated above. will be extracted.

in cases of this kind, which were more the objeÂ£tÂ»
of private i.ifurance, than of public contribution."
The prayers of the petitioners therefore rejec

the sams committee, also repo<ud ea the petitiou
of Jeremiah Cecil, and others, pilots within the
Chefapeak bay, praying that a law rpijjlit be palled
to regulate uniformly the conduct ef pilots through
out the United States, that though they did not
conceive it necefiary at present to pass a law to re
gulate thecondud of pilots throughout the Union,
they thought it would be ufeful to pass a law for
the regulation of the conduit of pilots in the \ya-t
ters of the Chrfapeak, and recommended a refulu.-

red baek to the committee to bring in a bill.*
Mr. Swanwick also reported on the petition of

1- fomet'me since stated that Morfcau had retreated
a, toStocknach and Fieybourgh, instead of retiring by
tf Huningue, as it \raÂ» supposed he would. In retreating
j to Freybourg his design was to rt-,erofs the' Uhine at
J KÂ«hl and Strafbiirgh to prmeil those places, and pcr
haps to retain pofleflion of the right bank of the Rhine
10 in'the Brifgaw. With this view he had marched as far
as Freybourg. Here the Archduke attacked him on tht
ts 19th, and after an obstinate conflict in whieh the Arc
h duke behaved with great persona! gallantry, theFremh
, e ppfts were defeated, and their army compelled to rt
f tire, with the loss of 1000 prifoncrs and probably about
8 half that number in killed and wounded. Moreau still
entertained.hopes of maintaining himfelf on the right
;4 ' bank of the .Rhine, and polled himfelf adv,intageou(ly
h for that purpÂ«ie ; but the Auftrians having made difpo
sr fitions to attack him on the 24th, he again retired,
lis and retreated acrofi the Rhine into France on the a6th,
c f still keeping polTeflion of the strong head of the bridge
at Huningue, by which he secures a paffajje into Ger
many.
From the 18th to the 26th there seems ta have been
'Â£ couritinual aflions of posts, in which theÂ»Auftiians
generally had the advantage ; but at 110 time, not even
to on the 19th did the French fufl'er a complete defeat,
b- The next object oT the Arahduke, it is said, will be
the capture of lCehl, in which he will probably fuc
,j ceed. _ t '

joint aj weli as separate property of the said Gentle
men, is, and ought to be, liable. And whereas
it ta clearly and fatisfa&orily afcertaifted, that mr.
Blair M'Clenachan, of the said firm,, ha? conveyed
away to mr. "John 11. Kujlon, His son-in-law, to his

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the puWic prints,
warning all perfonr. against purchafnig from the
grantees of Blair M'Clenachifi), any portion of the
large, real and personal estates he conveyed away to
hie Con-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upon tlie fubjeÂ£t by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well cf Glair
M'Clenachan ami P. Moore as of Blair M'Clens
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confidad in the fubk-ribere by
those creditorÂ» : a step which it would Jiave been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very ftatenacnt of the fatt therefore must dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindi&ive." It originated in a desire to feeure
the property of the debtor as a sand for the pay
ment of his jaft debts. It was fanflioned by the
advice of council as a measure nccejfary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advertisement haÂ« been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjuftiliable conduit, not to the sub
scribers .vho have merely puUithed the truth, in
terras as mild as the fact would admit, and who
mean to invefligate in a court of justice the
validity of those purchaseS of which Mr.. M'Cle
nachan so confidently speaks.
The fubfenbers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
eaution against purchasing of those grautees or
either of them, and to extend the terms <jf it to a
pnrchafe from any other persons (if such there be)
tp wbem Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
conveyances.
