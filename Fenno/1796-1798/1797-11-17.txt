PROCLAMATION
Of the Executive DireSory tn the French Na
tion, to the end tfiat the French armies tnay
be complete and ready to march by the 15/6
of Vtndemaire next, 08. 6.
The 18th FruÂ£tidor [Sept. 4] imposed si
lence on the orators of London who were
stationed i*n Paris. After that very memo
rable day, the English ambassador pressed to
rxplajn himfelf in a prtfitivemanner as tathe
firft <i>jedt of his legation, fee off on return
for England. On her fide, Austria fuffers
herfelf to be direfted by the Cabinet of St.
James's, which labours inccffantly to diftraft
Europe and foment troubles on the Conti
nent,, ; The Emperor thwarts the wilh of
his states and that of his court: he refills the
peace of which his fubjeSs are in need, and
confirms himfelf exclusively to preparations
for war. His armaments apprize us of what
weourfe|ves have to do. If the generous
loyalty which urged us to fubferibe to the
articles of Leqben is abused ; if, speaking
conflantlV of peace, nothing is breathed
but war, the French nation, which merely
speaks of war, because it is desirous of peace
wuJ put itfelf in a condition to support
its dignity ; and the valour of its armies
mutt recover its advantages. It-is more ef
pccially fcffefitial fully to convince the enemy
that there is no longer in France but one
â¢and a sole part, but one tentiment, b;it one
interest, that of a sovereign nation,-which
isfcufible of its grcatnefs, and which wiflies
to prefervc its libertyâThe Executive Di
rectory is fwaved by no other motive than
these. The law authorizes
lis to provide for the fafety of the (late.â
It is pleflfed to make you the judges of the
reasons which determine it to employ this
sacred right. Your enemies-who are not a
ble to rjfift your courage, have endeavour
ed to subdue you by stratagem. They de
ceived you by the (how of negoctatibn.- If
they had beenfincerely desirous of what they
appeartd to seek, peace would be now con
cluded. The Executive Drrc&ory hasten
ed to flop the progress of the French ar
mies. It gave itfelf up with sincerity to
the hope ps the good understanding which
dazzled its fight ; and enjoyed, in idea, the
means it was about to possess of causing li
berty to be beloved, and of procuring for
France as great a proportion of happinefe
in peace as (he had acquired of glory in war.
But after having obtained this interruption
in the progress ps our victories, what did
out enemies wi(h ? To gain time, to foment
among you intefline divisions, and to take
the advantage of what Would result from
them, to cause Frenchmen to massacre each
Cthcr, until they (hould be enabled to fall
oh the remnant of the population, to di
vide among themfelvcs the (hreds of a coun
try thus divided, and to blot out France
from the lift of nations. ' Republican good
faith could not have fufpe&ed this snare of
the policy of courts ; you mufi, however,
Jiare seen, citizens, whether this plan was
"not faithfu'ily followed up 5 the majority of
'yourpublic funftionarieseompofed the auxi
liary- army which fought in the bofotn of
France for your mod cruel enemies. v They
,'liad called hither swarms of those barbarous
emigrauts who are bent on tearing in pieces
the vitals of their country, and of those fa
ruatical priefls who are skilled in kindling up
*very where the murderous zeal of homicidal
piety. The national tribune no longer re
sounded unless with the voices of the depu
ties of Austria and England, calumniating
defenders, insulting your generals, em
ploying themselves in paralifing your gov
ernment, and reducing it gradually to the
abfolu'te nullity which corresponded so well
with th&r royal inftrudlions, and with the
views of their constituents. At' length the
veil is tore off ; âthe partizans of the so-
Nrign Courts are no longer the orgaÃS the
national will; the helm of the reptiblicris in
the hands of the republicans ; âand the
people of France have French Reprefenta
lives. Citizens, in these eircumftances,
â¢what course ought your magistrates to pur
sue ? A nimated by a sincere wish to give to I
Trance a peace worthy of her, that is to fay,
>a solid peace, agreeable to her interests, and
conformable- to her engagements, how are
they at this time to repulse the pretensions
and elude the fraud of the cabinet of Lon
don? How are they to put an end to the in
decisive tardiness of the cabinet of Vienna,
and to free Austria herfelf from English in
fluence, the only real obstacle to the peace
of Europe ? There is but one mode. Since
your enemies, in feigning to negociate, hold
themselves in an hostile state, their example
forces you again to take up arms, and ab>"'
folvcs you, by anticipation, from all the cala
mities which in their territories are about to
be the inevitable result of the rupture of the
truce. Ah ! if war be a feourge that ean
not be too much deteilcd.but the horrors of
which fall on those by whom it was provo
ked, if humanity revolts again ft those who
died blood, who plunder cities, and lay pro
vinces waste without a neceflity ; if the au
thor of an iniquitous war be responsible for
the death of the men who are killed, for the
deftruftion of the cottages which are burn
ed, forthelofsof commerce which ensues,
for the provisions whieh are deflroyed, for
the violence*, disorders, and crime, which
ire committed with arms in the hand ; if
those who feed on the horrors of war, enter
ed into without pretext and without reason,
are ferocious monsters, unworthy of the name
of men, not merely enemies of the countries
which they cause to be laid wafle, but ofvihe
whole human race :âyou who have for fix
years been forced to fight for yonr indepen
dence ! yon, on whom certain perfidious
men endeavour to bellow the fatal gift of a
civil war! you, who, conquerors and tri
fcmphant, laid down your arms to propose
pnd hear the words of peace ! you will not J

to defend. Thus, then, citizens, agai
take up your arms without ceasing to be dt

Letters from Bruflek ftatc, that Camil
le Jordan, and two others, had passed thro
Anvers. It was difeorcred too late who
they were, and that they intended to quit
the French territory.
There is the (Irongtft reason to believe,
that the courier dispatched by the Ejirefto
rp on the night of the 2d and 3d* comple
mentary day, Sept. 18 and 19, carried to
Buonaparte the orders to renew hostilities
with the Emperor. At tlye very moment
when the conrier fct off, a courier arrived
from Lisle with the intelligence that Lord
Malmefbury had quitted thai city, and had
set out for Londcn. His departure, which
so soon fuccecdcd the arrival of Treilhard
and Bonnier was the result of the firft con
versation with the new negociators.
" Have you power," said Treilhard to Lord
Malmefbury, " to restore to the French
Republic all her colonies."â" No"â
" Why then go heme and get them !"

Wjth much concern we now fay, that ( j
Lord Malmefbury has returned to England ij.
without accomplifhiag the objeft of his .
million.
With refpeft to the causes which led im- . y
mediately to the ruptijre of the negociatiÂ«ns,
the only information we have been able to t j
obtain is, that on the arrival of the new
commiflioners, Treilhard and Bonniere at ,j
Lisle, they demanded of Lord Malmefbuty
a final and categorical answer to -the terms
which had some time before been presented ] )(
to him as the fine qua non of peace. His
Lordship's reply was, that in that
stage of the negocintion he was not autho- as
rized by his court to agree to the propoli-
tions of the Executive Dire&ary. The a)
commiflioners immediately obferred, that it g
was evident his Lordfltip was not veiled
with the ncceffary powers to treat ; and,
therefore, that his further reljdence at Lisle
would be dispensed with by the government
of France. This observation was followed G
by a peremptory order for his Lordship to
quit the territories <jf the republic in the
course of eight and forty hours. It is ad
ded, .that fotne infultinginStiiiations were at
the fame time thrown ojit by the commis
sioners against the British cabinet, upon the Sr
fubjedt of the late conspiracy in France.â
Such, we are informed, was the abrupt man
ner in which the negociatioa was brought
(o a final termination.

PHILADELPHIA,
FRIDAY EVENIN3, NOVEMBER 17.
CONGRESS.
The House of Representatives met this
day pursuant to adjournment) but a quorum
of the Senate not being assembled, they ad
journed till Monday.
Mr. Langdon took hiÂ» feat in the Senate
this day. four members are yet wanting
to make a quorum of that House.
Married last evening, by the Rev. Doc
tor Green, Mr. Kennedy Long, merchant,
of the city of Baltimore, to Miss Eliza Ken- j
nedy, daughter of Mr. Andrew Kennedy j
of this city.
The (hip Cleopatra, capt. Smith, failed j
from Lisbon for Philadelphia about 50 days !
lince ; in which are pafftngers a Consul
from the court of Spain, to relide at Balti
more ; and two Commiflioners to fettle the
claims of American merchants, for proper
ty taken at sea by the Spanish cruisers.
The Jacobin editors, who have juftified
the demolition of the freedom of the press
in France, and the proscription and banish
ment of one half of the legislature, give great
credit to the defttoyers of the constitution
that they did not murder their colleagues.
There is no doubt the usurpers would glad
ly have cut their throats had they dared.
But the arrest of them is enough to have to
juftify at onie. They may poison them on
the passageâor if they reach their destina
tion, a flow lingering and miserable death is
their inevitable fate. In any point of view
the atroeity of the deed is unparalleled but
by the infamy of juftifying it. In the worst
times, of Rome, from the molt abandoned of
her political gladiators, from the Gracchi,
from Catiline or from Clodius, such an aft
would haTe met no countenance. Anthony
arid Odtavius, though ever ranked among!!
the mod profligate and unprincipled Oaves to
ambition, did not, in expelling their associ

more cirenflaftantiaily infarmud of the merfcs

Stage conveyance from Philadelphia to Shippenf
urg, or any other place.
Now from tbe liberal and generous support the

this business, William Geer, in conjun&ion with
Meflrs. Reily, Weed and Wi'.mer, is determittad
to prosecute and carry it on, with every care, at

The above company, who are amply provided
with carriages, horses, and every appurtenanee to
render the passage fefe and commodious, inform
those wnu wish to patronize and encourage' the
undertaking, that they can take their feats at
