CONGRESS.
'* HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
)f _
Thursday, May 17.
t Mr. Sitgreaves wiftied to propose an
additional rule to the Standing Rules and Or
â dersof the house. It must of course, he be
lieved, liej.upon the table a day previous to
j decision. He would therefore lay it before the
J house now, and call it up for decision to mor
[. row. It was as follows :
Â» s , " Resolved, that during the remainder of this JeJJton, the
Standing Rules and Orders of the House be amended by mdd
s ing the folloioing, That no member Jhall y either in the
]m house or in Committee of the -whole>fpeak more than once
Q to thefame quejlion."
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
f claims, made a report on the petition of Jona
' than Young, one of the militia artillery, cal
j led out in the itate of Maflachufetts, in confe
' quence of the requisition of 80,000 Militiaor
, j dered at the last fefiion, who was wounded by
one of the Gannon in exercising, so that he had
e been under the neceflity of having one of his
hands amputated. He prays for a pension.
1 The report is unfavourable, on the ground of
r the petitioner's not being in the service of the
1 , United States.âConcurred in.
The Speaker laid before the house the ad -
dress of the inhabitants of Newbern, N. Ca
rolina, ex pre Hi ve of their approbation of the
conduct of the Executive in their Negociati
ons with France, and of their determination to
support the future measures of Government.
Mr. Imlay presented addrefl'es to the fame
effe<st from the counties of Monmouth, Mid
dlelex and Burlington; and Mr. Schure
man one from Gloucester County, N. J.
They had the usual reference.
The house aÂ£ain resolved itfelf into a com
mittee of the whole on the State of the Union
on the bill authorifihg the President to raise a
Provisional Army; when theconlideration of
the third feflion being resumed,
f Mr. R. Williams moved to amend the
r fe&ion so as to make the Voluntary Corps pro
' posed to be embodied by that fettion, a part
of the Militia of the United States. It ap
peared to him unneceiTary, he said, for them
p to attempt to fay by whom, or by what au
thority the Officers of these corps shall be ap
pointed j because if thecdmmittee only point
out whether they (hall be considered as Mili
tia or Regulars, the constitution lias declared
' in what manner thev shall be officered. It
was not very materia! to him which they are
j considered, though he would rather have them
considered as Militia, as it would be the cause
of producing an effective Militia, which every
one acknowledges would be a desirable thing,
but if they are to be considered as regulars,
he believed it would produce a contrary ef
fect. He hoped, therefore, his amendment
would be agreed to.
Mr. Hartley was much surprised to find
that new difficulties should be raised against
this bill. The aggressions of the Frencli Na
tion had been so great, that he doubted not,
in one .month from the date hereof, every man
who is a friend of his country will be ready to
fay we ought no longer to bear with them.
The people of this country are jealous of their
rights, and to raise a large body of troops,
without immediate neceflity, would alarm
them ; but in our present situation, he won
dered the present measure should be objected
to. He should rather have expetted a De
claration of War, which he was confident
would be well received by a majority of this
house. Mr. H. trusted the present amend
ment would not prevail, as he wished these
volunteers by all means, to be commanded by
Officers appointed by the President of the
United States.
Mr. Brooks was of opinion that this ques
tion was decided yesterday. It tiiis amend
ment were to be adopted, it would (hew that
the committee had changed their minds since
yesterday as to the manner in which the Offi
cers of these Volunteers ought to be appoint
ed.
Mr. Sitg reaves did not rife to ajifwer
any arguments which had been urged in fa
vour of this amendment, but to express his
hope, that as this (Ã¼bjett had already been
fully difcufTed, no further time would be loft
upon it. He addressed hirafelf particularly to
the friends of the hill, that so far as it depen
ded upon them no time might be loftupon it.
Mr. M'Dowell differed in opinion with
the gentleman from New York (Mr. Brooks)
when he considered this the fame question
which was determined yesterday. It was said
by gentlemen yesterday, that it was unfair to
vote for striking out a fe&ion which was ca
pable of being so amended as to do away the
Â©bjedtions brought againftit. He believed some
gentlemen voted against striking out the fee
tion on that ground. But gentlemen arse all at
once very desirous of cutting short difcuflion.
Those who heretofore spent days in debating
on comparatively very unimportant fubjedts ;
now wish a question of great magnitude to be
taken without debate.
When this fubjetl was yesterday under
difcuflion, the gentleman from S. Carolina
(Mr. Harper) said he wished to keep up the
present system of alarm, in order to answer
certain purposes of government. It had al
ready been kept up for some time, and pro
duced effects which, he believed, could not
haVe been produced without it. It was well ;
known that certain gentlemen in this house
had for along time part been endeavouring to
increase our Military eftablifliment, and to
raise a Navy, and they had seized this moment 1
of alarm to effect both purposes.' 1
Gentlemen speaking ot the Important fer- i
vices to be atchieved by the young men pro- 1
1 posed to be raised, said, that they would make l
bare their arms, and shield us from all danger. ]
Though he should wish to encourage in our <
youth an ardent desire to defend their country, i
he did not wish toexpofe them to danger alone. <
He wished the citizens generally to bear their i
share in the feivice, whenever danger shall
appear. But it had been said, these men can a
do no good except their Officers are appointed â¬
by the President. His signature was to do every I
thing"; If he thought the seal of the President c
could poll'efs all the virtue ascribed to it, he \
might agree to its being used in this cafe; but 1
whilst he believed the Officers appointed by t
the several States are as good, and as well dif- t
posed to dafend their country, as any the Pre- (
iident can appoint, he could not agree to their c
being changed in the way proposed. He could c
not conceive why gewtleraen should be jea- >
lous of their own States appointing improper 1
persons. To give the President this right ;
would be to add greatly to his power. He t
believed Congress ought to be cautious how e
they increase this power; and however un- r
By John Fenno, N O, il9 Cbefnut Street,
popular the opinion may at present be, he
would express his determination not to in
, crease that po\ierby taking a portion Of it
>. from the Governments of the Individual
Sta(es, or froni this body, andaddiiigit to his.
He wiftied to keep each power within its pre
m sent bounds.
Mr. M'D. repeated what has several times
r _ been /aid, that it is extraordinary that the
0 Northern and Eaftem States, fliould insist np
,e on defending the Southern against (heir will.
-- It was ("aid, this corps was wanted to answer
the4ike purposes for which a similar force has
been raised in England and Ireland. And
1 what, said Mr. M'D. have they been used for
, e there, but to ftipprefs Puliiical Opinion. The
â C Military force is there riding over the people,
and dragging husbands and fathers from their
if wives and children, to prison, merely because
- they have taken the liberty to think. However
- much gentlemen wiftied to support certain
- opinions in this country, he hoped they would
- not wish them to be forced upon the people
y by a system of Terror. He apprehended the
i zeal of gentlemen had carried them too far on
s this occasion.
Mr. R. Williams did not make this mo
f tion, he said, to give any gentleman an op
-5 portunity of answering the arguments of ye
sterday, nor to bring at all into debate the
- question of yesterday. He made it in confor
. mity to an opinion which he then gave, and
; upon which he roted for the retaining of this
- feflion. But it is a little extraordinary that
> gentlemen will not permit others who merely
. differ with them as tp the mode of defence,
; without having imputed to them by those
. gentlemen a disposition to leave the country
. entirely defencelefs, and at the mercy of a
foreign enemy. If ever (here was a question
came before this house during the present fef
â¢ lion, in which these insinuations might have '
1 been spared, he thought the present must be
1 one. What is the question > It is merely j
f whether the President/hall accept ofany com- ;
panies of persons who may offer themselves, i
â  and that they (hall be called Militia. He had I
as much a disposition to put the country in a â 
: ftatesf defence as any man; but he believed a !
good militia would be its defence, It '
1 I had been conceded, that in cafe of a sudden I
[ attack, the militia must be resorted to in the
firit instance. Why will gentlemen fay, that !
because a member wishes these men to be con
I fidered as militia, he is against providing ade- !
| fence for his country. If he thought it would j
b; belt, he certainly ought toadvife it, with
out meeting with any such imputations, and j
he did think so, and therefore advised it. He j
thought arms ought to be fodiftributed thro' 1
the country, that in cafe of danger, every
man might leave his plough, and take up his
mulket to defend his country. If war should
take place, then, as had frequently been said,
there would be no objedtion to (landing troops, i.
How'could these men, Mc. W. asked, be
less disposed to defend their country, because
their officers were appointed by the Individu
al States, than if they had been appointed by
the President of the United States. The gen- !
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sitgreaves) i
addrefled himfelf to a certain part'of the cÂ»m- |
mittee. He should nevfcr follow his exam
ple, but address what he had got to fay to e
very member present. He had never any
particular charters in view. Mr. W. said,
he did not wish to take up much time of the
committee, nor should he have risen at all,
had it not been for an insinuation that his mo
tion owed its rife to improper motives, than
which nothing tended more to lower the dig
nity of the proceedings of the legiflatnre as <
the Union.
Mr. Davis said, itwas much to be lamen- i
ted, that whilst gentlemen are all agreed in i
principle, they should differ as to the means ;
of carrying that principle into eftecl. There I
are few members, Mr. D. said, who do not
agree as to the necessity of having troops in '
addition to our present militia. Indeed, he ;
must own he did not feel all that security from <
militia alone which had been exprefled bv 1
some gentlemen. He knew the French had t
landed an Army in this country heretofore, I
in defiance of the Bririfh Navy, and therefore c
might do it again ; the Ocean was 11111 open, t
He was therefore impressed with the necelfity 1
of railing men of some kind for the defence of a
the country j but the mode proposed by the f
bill as it Hands, he objeded to. Hewasafraid a
of the conferences. It would create jeak>u- r
lies and suspicions of a serious nature. Every
one knows that the people of the United o
States are divided in . their opinions. Some 11
have-implicit confidence in every every thing ii
which is done or recommended by the Pre'fi- n
dent of the United States. Others have not t
this confidence. The Eafiern States tor in- n
fiance place great reliance in the President,
and this is natural. They are well acquainted il
with his person and character, and are there- n
fore attached to him from local prejudices, n
Gentlemen from the southern States are, on f.
the contrary (perhaps too much so) prejudic- a
ed against the President. What will be the fc
conlequence ? If this bill pades, as it now a:
(lands, the people of the Kaftern States will o
probably turn out and offer their services to c;
the President ; perhaps those offhe Southern o
will not. This might produce bad effects. It lÂ«
is probable that those who turn out will be w
called Executive Men, whilst those who do not, K
will be termed Di/organizers, 'which will create "
a disagreeable, and perhaps a dangerous divi- h
fion in the countryâa division, the effects of ta
which he otfned he was afraid. Thebeftway, fc
he believed, would be to call upon every a
(late to furnifli its quota of men, to go into oi
the field for a year or two, and not leave the tl
matter optional,.as by this bill. His fears on p
this head, did not arise from any apprehension et
that the President would abuse the power tc
placed in him of appointing Officers and ac- tc
cepting of the service of men ; they arose ai
from an apprehension of undue agitati- oi
ons in the Public Mind, and from thejealou- qi
fiesand ftrifes which would grow out of them, w
Great inconvenience, if not danger, would tl:
arise not only from the difference of opinion is
exirtingin the Southern and Eastern States; hi
but also in the States themselves. In the Hate hi
ot New York, for instance, some of the Re- b
prefentativesareadvocatesof every Executive at
measures, and others are generally opposed to oi
them. Part of the people of that State might R
therefore be expected to come forward and tl:
offer their services to the President, whilst m
others will decline doing it, which will pro- oi
duce a division in tint Ifate. The fame thing tu
would take place in some others. When he c<
recollected all these difficulties and disagree
able consequences, he mult be opposed to the In
bill; not fromany fear of Public Liberty being p
endangered by the existence of such a body of d
men, but merely on accotir.; of the circutn- G
le fiances he had mentioned. If any gentleman
l- would bring forward a proposition fer jblig
it ing every State to provide a certain number
al of men, he would vote for it. When he vo
s. i ted against this bill, he hoped it would not be
I considered that he did so, from a with to yield
I pallive obedience to any Nation in the world,
;s but solely for the reasons which he had men
le tioned.
t- Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) was opposed
I. to the motion upon every principle, but ef'pe
r cially because it was founded avowedly in a
is diftrult of the firft magistrate, in whom the
d people most deservedly reposed the highell
>r confidence. If the amendment prevailed, it
e would neutralize and render nugatory, one of
â , the most important provisions of the bill. The
r member from Kentueky (Mr. Davis) had de
e viated from his usual course of fair argument,
r and had thought fit to indulge himfelf in re
n fleftions illy calculated to cement the Union,
or to inspire a confidence in the general go
e vernment. To what good end did that gen
e tleman attempt to influence improperly the
a decisions of Congress upon important quelti
ons, by unfounded intimations that the attach
- mentto, and confidence in the President, was
- merely local, and confined alinoft exclulively
- to that portion of the Union, which was his
5 birth place and residence, and that any mea
sures tending to increase the Executive influ
i ence would be viewed in other parts, anti par
s ticularly in the So"thern States with jealoLily
t and disapprobation. Language so unwarranta
i ble tended only to irritate and divide, and
, ought not to efcapcthe leveredanimadverlion.
; Mr. Da vi s asked and vvas permitted to ex
r plain. He said he did not fay that this was the
i cafe; but that the President having been born
l and educated in the Eastern States, it was na
tural the people there (liould be attached to
: ; him, in a greater degree than in other parts
: : Â«f the Union.
' j When Mr. Davis fat down, Mr. Dayton
â  ( said, that he had been in the habit of respeCt- 1
i | ing the gentleman from Kentucky, for his
I ! candour and general correCtness of opinion,
i â  yet he felt himfelf compelled to declare that
l | he was not better fatisfied with the explanati
: 1 on than with the firft speech. The 'jealousy
i I and diftrult which gentlemen from Southern
States, and particularly from Virginia, ex
: i prefTed so unqualifiedly in respeCt to Execu
: tive measures, was not new in Congress, but
j was of much earlier date than the election of
I the present President, and could not therefore
; have its source in any belief of want of merit,
| talents or probity in him.
| Ihe fame diftrult had marked the con
| duCt and speeches of the members from
that State for at lead four years past ; and the
former President had been as much the objeCt
of jealousy as the present, nay even more so, !
although his place of birth ard residence was ;
j. in their neighbourhood. In proof of this, he '
recolledled well that a very influential mem- |
ber from Virginia (Mr. Giles) now absent ;
from the House oil account of sickness, had on
. a former occasion moll unequivocally declar
' ed, that he no longer reposed confidence in
' the man who was then President and Head of
i the Executive Department.
As the Representatives who now diflrufled
the Government, and opposed its acts, distrus
ted and opposed it then, when he who presided
was a citizen felefted from their own neigh
bourhood, so itwas remarkable that the pre
sent supporters of the Government were among
the molt zealous to support it at that time,
without regard to the distance of birth place
and residence of the character who administer
ed it. This, Mr. D. said, mu'ft convince eve
ry unprejudiced mind, that confidence and
dillruft were not influenced by local conside
rations as had been suggested, but must be ! 1
ascribed to other causes. that of the merits of ; !
the objects in the one cafe, and of a fixed and j >
determined temper of opposition in the other, j I
1 lie object of the bill was to provide a prompt ! '
and efficient defence for the country, threat- j '
ened as it was with hpftility, and *hat of the 1 <
feClion underconfideration was, in furtherance I <
of that object, to aurhorife the acceptance of '
such Volunteers ;is would firft step forth in I
cafe of danger. They would not be deterred '
from offering their services by any apprehen- (
lion ot their being called " Executive men," a
as the member had expressed it. They would t
feel themselves superior to such insinuations, )
and would merit by til/ conduct, the liono- '
rable appellation of Dqenders of their country. J
Mr. D. concluded with exhorting the friends t
of this system of defence tooppofe this amend
merit as destructive ot its energy, and as com- d
ing from, and advocated by its avowed ene- y
mies, whose wilh mult be to make it worse ra- f<
ther than better, and thereby to encreafe the o
number of its opponents. tl
Mr. Harper was not prepared to fay, even
if he considered .the reasoning of the gentle
man from Kentucky founded, that govern- ei
ment ought to rejea an Eastern or a Northern tl
force, because they could get no force from w
any other quarter. He was of opinion, that if c<
'so many men could not be got from the South, w
as from the North and Ealt, it was an additi- it
onal reason foradopting the present bill ; be- P'
cause, in proportion as some parts of the Uni- at
on would be inclined to submit, we ought to fr
hii (band the force from other quarters. Buthe tl
was far from agreeing witlwhe gentleman from ef
Kentucky on the present occasion, however cl
great respeCt he always felt inclined to pay to lit
his opinions. He seemed to think that volun
tary enlillments"would not take place to the
southward; that in those dates there mayexift m
a want of confidence in the President; a want th
of attachment to the Government; a want of cc
that ardour which may be expected in other th
parts of the country. Mr. H. said, he believ- eC
ed that the peopje in those parts of the. Union m
to which he alluded, are as ftrongl'y attached w
to the Government, and to the Executive, a
and have as good an opinion of the measures th
of Government, as the people in any other be
quarter of the Union. Nordid he bslievethey th
would be behind witn any others in giving a ge
thorough support to this Government, which nj
is the objeCt oftheir choice. In proof of this, of
he might cite the various Memorials which. th
have come from those parts, not only on this, ot
but former occasions, in which the flrongefl us
attachment to the Government is expressed ; or
or he might appeal ta the language of the so
Representatives themselves who come from so
thence, who constantly fay, -iiat howeverthey fu
may differ in opinion from other gentlemen hi
on political questions, they and their confli-"' ex
tuents will always be ready to defend their ar
country in time of danger. ' m
Mr. H. knew thatcertain politicians inthif qi
house, under the influence of a determined bl
Party Sp.rit, had set their faces in the most th
decided manner in opposition to all the aCtsof ge
Government; but they have not been able to itc
in induce acorrefporiding fentimentin the coiin l
5- try from whence they came. He knew thei*
er mistakes were seen and pardoned on acconnt
->â¢ of their talents and probity in other refpeCfs j
>e but though thoir mistakes are pardoned, they
Id are not gone into. He knew also that it is the
d, creed of those gentlemen, that when a meafurfi
1- has been adopted it ought to be carried into
effeÂ£l ; therefore though a difference of poli-Â»>
:d tical opinion exifls, & muftexift, therecanbend
doubt that whenever danger approaches, theft!
a will be but one voice. The conduct of the
le Virginia Militia, when called upon to march
;ft again (I the insurgents against the Excise Law
it in this (late, had been irequently mentioned,
jf and with propriety, in Hlutfration of this fad.
le He did not dOubt the fame spirit of alacrity to
preserve order in the country, and a due obe
t, dience to the laws, would be fhevvn, when
ever an occasion shall call for it, and, if pofli
1, ble, more so, in defending the country against
Â»- a Foreign enemy. So tar from the embodying
Â°f these volunteers proving an invidious dif
e tindion between different parts of the coun
-- try, he believed it would prove the reverse*
- The people of N. Carolina, S. Carolina, ajid
is Virginia, so far from holding their services
y back, because they fee the Northern and
is Eastern States come forward, the fight vvould
- arouse them. They would immediately fay,-
uOurbrethren, with whom we shed our blood
in the common cause ot Independence, are
y taking up Arms tor again defenuing their"
- country against a Foreign enemy, let us join
J them." 1 his would be their feeling, and they
1. would not flitter themselves to be outdone by
any part of the Union. Mr. H. was not afraid
e of the want of spirit in the southern country.
11 He believed their strength was less than that
ot lome other states, but their will was equal
0 to the will of any. Thev would risk tiieir all
s in defence of their cotinrty. He never had,
nor ever should have any doubt on this fub
n jest.
- { Mr. H. said, he would here notice an ob
s j fervation of the gentleman from Pewifylva
1, nia made yesterday. He asked in what re
t fpedts these voluntary corps would bejjrefer
- able to ordinary Militia ? He vvould ask, in
/ his turn, in what refpe<fts men able, afcfive and
ii willing to serve their country, men bound by
- one sentiment, are preferable to men of alt
- a Â» es > characters and dispositions, 'forced into
t the service? and whether the former, whose
f convenience permits them to leave home, and
e who do not leave help left families behind
, them, are not likely to be a more effectual
force than the latter ? âHe believed there
- would be no doubt on the fubjedt. Every one
1 knows that the Militia Officers are an ex
- tremely refpeftable class ot men \ yet it was
t also known many of them could not, without
, great facrifices go into active service, aad
s some were too old to do it. Some might also
- he indisposed to come forward, and wherever
- j this should be the cafe, the President ought to
t ; have power to appoint others. Whenever
1 Militia Officers are able and willing to serve,
there is no doubt they will be preferred to
1 others.
Another striking difference existing between
this corps and ordinary Militia, was this,
1 These voluteers may be called out, and train
â  ed in the use of Arms, and Military Difcip
[ lme ; before they are wanted for immediate
service, whereas the ordinary Militia could
not be called out, except in cafe of aftuai dan
ger. This was a great advantage in favour of
these corps. Â«
But it was said, these volunteers might en
list in the independent Companies at present
in exigence. This would fe pa rate person*
; in the fame neighbourhood*and spread
; them throughout the country ; anti ioftead
jot being diftintt bodies, where they could
; know their own officers, they would be plac
â¢ ed under men whose characters they would
j be unacquainted with, and their military fpi
: rit, which ought to be kept alive and encou
j raged, would, by this means, be frittered
: down and destroyed. Btfidcs, in some parts
of the country, there may be a greater num
ber of volunteers than could be admitted in
to existing companies. Take, for instance,
the county of Lancaster, where there are five
or fix volunteer companies now organized,
and which might admit to complete them, 3
or .too young men j but there rhay be 200 a
young men in that county ready to serve ; and
if so, what could be done with the surplus >
They mud of couife be sent to a distance. or
their service be loft.
Under this view of the fubjeft, and confi
denng this as a repetition of the motion of
yesterday, lie should give it his difFent, as he
saw no difference betwixt amending the secti
on in this manner, and striking it out altoge
ther. 0
Mr. W. Claiborne said, whether or not
all the measures of the Executive are approv
ed throughout the United States, is not now
the question. The proposed amendment met
with his approbation, and it a majority of this
committee /hall think proper to adopt it, it
would not be less acceptable to him, because
it was made and flip ported by gentlemen sup
posed inimical to the bjll. His motive tor
advocating this amendment, did not arise
froip any jealousy of the Present's mifiÃing
the power, but from an apprehension of its
effects upon the militia. He believed if the
clause was to be agreed to as it stands, the mi
iitia are gone.
Early in the present feflion acommittee was
appointed to prepare a bill (or placiug the
militia of this country ppon a better footing
than at present. They reported a bill re
commending a feleft corps of militia ; but
the farther consideration thereof was palipon
ed until the next lefit'oii. The present a
mendment embraced the fame idea, and if it
were carried, the volunteeryouth would fotnt
a kind ot feled corps to the militia. Would,
this amendment, if adopted, lefi:;n the num
ber of men who would be ready to rally round
the standard of government, whenever dan
ger (halt threaten ? No ; it would not, it was
merely calculated to put them on the ground
of militia, in (lead of making them a part of
tile army, and to prevent adangerousincreale
of that eflablifliment. For it was not a call
upon any particular part of the union, but up
on all the youth of the Unit.-d States, to come
forward and enroll themselves as volunteer
soldiers, be officered by the Prelident, and
fubjetl themselves to bfc called into service at
Mis pleasure ; and from the spirit which now
exilts in the United States, and the military
ardour of our youth, he had no doubt their
numbers would be very large. The conse
quence will be that our militia will be enfee
bled by the attachment of our youne men to
this chosen band, and what remained will be
generally aged and infirm. If it was the in
tcn'ion deftroy the militia aL-
\VOLVME XIII.together it would fce well for them to-fay so; I
if not, he thought they ought to agree to the (
present amendment. *
The gentleman from S. Carolina has said, 1
texcept thiÂ« feetion is agreed to as it i
(lands, the country would be deprived of the I
ferv : ces of these patriotic young men. He
was of a different opinion. He believed, it 1
these young men wiftied to serve their cous- i
try in time of danger, they would immediate- !
]y form themselves into companies, and learn '
the life of arms, so that they may ail to
greater advantage as a part ot the militia of
the several Hates. Whilst military zeal is at
its present height, he wifhe,d advantage to be
taken of it, but in the way he had mentioned.
This fervor would have a good etfeft on the 1
militia, by reviving the dormant spirit of that
body of men, whom he looked upon as the
great fafeguard of the country. He had not
the honor with the gentleman from N. Jer
sey (the Speakt'r) of ranking amongst the
krtown defenders of the United States; buthe
wilhed to be a supporter of the present moti
on, and when danger ftiall appear, he hoped
he should be found an humble defender of
his country. ,
Mr. J. Williams would not have said a
ny thing on this lubject, had it not been for
what had fallen from the gentleman from
Kentucky, From the age of that gentleman
tnd of the gentleman last up from Tenneflee,
it w as evident they (lid not take an active part
in this country in the year 1775 ; but it will
be recolletted that there were volunteers at
that time called minute-men, who were ofgreat
service. When the British marched from
Boflon to Lexington, the militia joined the
minute-men, after they had been defeated by
the British. He never before heard that to
take volunteers from the body of militia,
would ruin the militia.
In the year 1775, the tnilitia came forward
in volunteer coips, and instituted a military
school. Hd hoped this would be done now,
as it wquld be advisable for our youth to make
themselves acquainted with military duty,
whether we are engaged in war, or not.
Every poflible objeflion Mr. W. said, w*Â«
urged against this bill. It was much to be
regretted that time fhotild be so uselessly em- j
ployed, by so many obstacles being thrown in j
the way of this bill. If he supposed with the .
gentleman from Kentucky, that it would pro ,
duce disorder in any of the dates, he should,
bo one of the last to vote for it. But if the j
addrefTes lately received from the fourhward, j
were referred to, it would be found the peo
ple in that country are as ready to support the |
government, as the people to the eastward are. !
Indeed the youth of Baltimore, it appears, are j
as ready as those of this city, or New-York,
to come forward in defence of their country, |
and lie expected shortly to hear that the youth |
of Charleston had done the fame. He hoped,
infteaa of damping this spirit, by agreeing to
the present motion, every thing would be
done tofi'.pport and cherish it.
Mr. R. Williams rose to reply to the
charge made by the Speaker of his having
voted for flriking out the whole of the feiti
on, atidof beinj, consequently, an enemy to
f the principle of the bill. He said he had vo
ted for it, with a hope of introducing the pre
sent amendment.
The quflion on the amendment was put and
negatived 50 to 38. ,
Mr. Shepard moved to strike out the pro
viiiion that went to confine the use of these
volunteers in the state to which they belong,
cr in an adjoining state, which was carried,
there being 60 votes for it.
Mr. Gallatin then moved to strike out
the following words in the third feetion,
" within three years after the parting of thjs
ait, and inferring in iieit thereof the words,
" heforetbe nextfeffion of Congress," which was
negatived 48 to 41.
The committee then rose, a'nd the house

French depredations. This bill authorizes
the commanders and crews of merchants ves
sels to oppose thq attack or iearch ol any
French arnied veHel, and to repel any such
learch or attack by force, and to capture the I
vefl'els making foch attack. All such cap- i
tures to go one half to the owner of the vef- ]

NEW-YORK, June 6.
We have authentic information from Eu
rope, and have authority to (late, that unless
we unite as a band of brothers in defence
of our independence, we fliall be called to
witness, and that soon, an open attempt to
reduce us to the fatue disgrace and rsin, as
the Swiss, Dutch and other free nations
have experienced under the do-nination of
the French in consequence of their attach
ment to foreign nations and internal di
visions.
The dire story have undoubtedly fettled
their plan refpefting America, and this plan
is not consistent with a reception of our En
voys and an accommodation of differences.
They have been informed by their own
agents who have been in this country, and
by our own citizens, that we are a divided
people ; that our government ,does Rot pof
fels the hearts of our citizens; that the great
body of people are displeased with 1 heir
rulers, and paflionately attached to France ;
and that they could make a fourth of Sept.
at Philadelphia -with as much ease as at Paris
[Our readers will recolleft this was tlye ar
rest and banifliment of Barthelemy and
i PichfgruâThe declaration, when uttered
in plain language, is that, with the help of
their friends and agents here, they could
seize President Adams, the heads of depart
ments and all the supporters of adminiftra
ton, fend them into banifliment, and put
Jefferfon, Madison, Monroe and Burr in
their places.]
A Frenchman by the name of Bayard,
who lately returned from America, has ptib
lifhed his travels through the United States,
which book has been printed in Paris, in
which he fays, " That France wants only a
footing upon the Continent to regulate the defli
nies of the United States."
If any man can read these fafts, without
a glow of indignation, he lfruft be a traitor
to his country, and fitted to be the vile slave
of a foreign despotism.
Our time, though delayed by the great
projefts of France in Europe, which occu
py httr forces, will certainly come, when we
are to be invaded by a body of their troops,
who are to be joined by their friends
among us, our Jacobins, and when our " des
tinies are to be regulated by the French
Direftory." Our eleftions are to be an
nulled by an ediiS of some French commif
i fary at the head of a few thousand foreign
troops, and a great bod of domestic trai
tors These men wil take possession of our
forts and arsenals, as they have done in
Switzerland, and we must receive a consti
tution of governnrttnt from Paris, as the
Dutch and Swedes have been compelled to
doâThis projeft is unquestionably fettled
t in the French councils, and delayed only by
the invasion of England and other revolu
tionary schemes. On these points we have
, to make up our minds and that very soon
âWf mull soon be called upon to draw a
â  line of dillinftion between patriots ft traitors
: âto separate the wheat from the chaff.

To Columbia, who, gladly reclin'd rt her cafe,
On Atlantic's broad bosom lay fouling in peace ;
Minerva flew haflily, sent from above,
â¢And addref'd her fromthunderi/tg Jove:

" For your freedom's at flake,
" Storms arise your renowu'dindependcncetolhake;
" Then lose not a moyitnr, my aid 1 will lend,
" It your sons will ailemblc your rights to defend."

We'il deserve the prote&ion he'll fend'from above.
For ne'er shall the sons of America bend,
I But united, their rights and their freedom defend.
â¢ Hl -
I Minerva fmil'd cheerfully as (he withdrew,
i " For," said (he *â¢ our 11 y Mercury of.time* reports

Tell that vile God of Thieves,
His report but deceives,
And wecare not what madman such nonfenfftbclieves
For e6'er lhall t!vfon-> of America bend,
But, united, their right 6 and their freedom defend.

Jove rejoie'd in Columbians this union to fee.
And swore by Â©ld Styx, they deferv'd to be fretf.
Then alTembled the Gods, and to all gave consent,
Their afliftance if neÂ«dful in war to prcfent ;
Mars arofc, shook his armour,

Minerva refolv'd th.it her JEv,is Oie'd lend ;
i And Apollo declared he their cause would befriend;
Old Vulcan an armour would forge for their aid,
More firm ih n the one for Achilles he made :
Then said he I'll prepare

Ye sons of Columbia, then join hand in hand,
Divided we fall, but united we stand ;
'Tis ours to determine, 'tis ours to decree,
That in peace we will Jive independent and free,

Break the horrors of war,
We'll always be ready at once to declare.
That ne'er will the sons of America bend;

MR. FENNO,
ON reading in a morning's paper the ac
count of the reduftion of poor SWIT
ZERLAND to French Tyranny, I waÂ»
forcibly ft ruck with the similarity betwee*
the language of what was called the French
faSion in the Council of Berne, and that of
certain members in the Houff of Represen
tatives, on questions of felf-defence 5 such i
as fuffering the merchant vefiVfs to arip, fit- 1
tii.g out vcffels to aft as convoys, railing I
troops, &c. &c. The "Fiench party in the
Council are represented as being ih favor of
procrafti-iation, and opposed to " manly
and decisive measures, lead they fhruld irri
tate the enemy," when that enemy was march
ing in son eto attack them. Compare this
with, the Speeches of a Nicho as, a Galla
tin, Livingfton, and some others I will
not fay the motives were t l e fame, but we
have at least experienced a strange want of
energy, and a criminal supine essâa blind
confidence in a fup|>ofed friendfhip, instead
rf which, rothinf hss be-tv received but
afts of hostility and aggression,
But the molt awful lesson for America in
[he whole hiftnry is this, that all the Jccret
refolutinns of the Council, were immediately
communicated to the commanding officer of . >
the invading army. 1

MR. FENNO,
THE enclosed printed Ciicular Letter
signed J. M'Dowell fcems intended for the
publicâindeed it has already appeared in
one of the newspapers of the city withoutthe
signature, it therefore becomes necessary in"
julticeto others, that the an-hor should be
known ; 'tis said he is a General and a Mem
ber of Congress from North-Carolina. Is
it poifible such a charaftercan entertain and
disseminate sentiments so hoitile, and infor
mation so falfe against the government of
our country ? 'Tis to be hoped not , and
yet when we are told this man is the bosom
friend and intimate compauioa of a certain
notorious French agent and spy, the ex
gcneral C 1 we need not befurprized.
As this Circular is very lengthy, it ir.av on
ly be uCjfnl to publish the lad paragraph
which fufficiently discovers the drift of the
writer. But to do the American General
judice, it is fuggeftedon pretty good grounds
of belief that the letter was penned by his
worthy friend the Frfcnch general, and cor
rcited and revised by the celebrated Calen
der another particular political friend of our
Hero. |
The attention of every American to this
lad paragraph is requeded ; let them ex
amine it with care, and alk themselves if a
man who entertains sentiments so inimical to
principles of republicanism, and difrefpeft
ful $0 the solemn vote of a large majority of
the representatives of the nation, defervet
the confidence of honed men or real repub
licans !
It is by such letters that many virtuous
unfufpefting men to the southward are im
posed upon, and induced to look on their
own government with hatred and jealousy.
The moment Congress convenes, immense
numbers of crude, fitly and abominable li
bels against the adminiltration are sent thro'
all parts of the country to poifori the minds
of the people and dellroy their happiness, in
the fame manner as the effluvia arising from
acity infefted with the Yellow Fevei*, poi- .
fon3 and destroys the health of those who |
approach it.
May that kind Providence who has so of
ten rescued our country from dangers; pre
serve us from the malignant effects of both.

" The substance or amount of this aft
is to authorize the President of the United
States to indruft and direst the commanders
of the public armed veflels, belonging to
the United States, to seize, take and bring
into port, to bi proceeded against according
to the law of nations, all French armed vel
fels, which have committed or which shall
commit aggreflions on, or have or shall cap
ture any American veflels, and to retake
any they may have captured.
This bill was opposed ondifferent grounds:
Firff, that it was a vislation of the law of
nations and a violation of an exilting treaty
with France, and that it was impolitic and
wrong to proceed such lengths before ws
know the final result ef the negociation and
before we had our small fleet equipped and
in readiness ; for, from the latefl accounts,
our commiflioners were dill in France, and
had some hopes of an accommodation. Buc
this bill paired on Saturday, 50 in favor,
and 40 against, and what was very extra
ordinary, the anxiety was so great, that the
bill being taken up in the morning paffea |
two readings on the fame day, thoUgn of I
the utmost importance, which was contrary
to the rules of the houf . A podponemcnt
could not be obtained until Monday, which,
I believe, was for fear of favourable infor

the die to be cad ; they have now accsm
plifhed the long premeditated plan, for they
have long been going on in an indireft way,
deceiving the people of the United States,
that they might get them on their fide, and
I mud now conclude the attempt to nego
ciate a mere deception, and that the sole
objeft has been to bring us into the war to
relieve falling Btitain, and to form an a li
ance with that nation, to assimilate this
government to that; by which monarchy
will be endeavoured to be established here.
This bill has been followed by a refolutiou

MR. FEN NO,
Fleafe to insert in your paper, the following ex
" tra#, taken from an Oration in commemoration
of the Annivrrfary of Independence,
deivcred by John Qnucr Adams, Ef>i. in ifcoyear to the inhiMtwics of the town of Bos
ton. As the sentiments are truly American, [
prefurnc they #ill not be unwelcome to thii public
9t this time
â¢' Americans! let Â»s panfe for a moment to
eonfider the situation of ourcountry, atth.it e
ventful day when our national exiltence com
ineuced. In the full poflefiion and enjoyment of
all those prerogatives for which you then dared
to adventure upon " all the varieties of untried
being," the calm and unfettl.d moderation of
the mind, is lcarcely competent to conceive the
I tone of heroism, to which the lbuls of freemen
I were exalted in that hourpf perilous magnanim
Â» ity. Seventeen times has the fun, in the pro
gress of his annual revolutions, diffufed his pro
lific radiance over the plains of independent A
merica. Millions of hearts which then pilpi
taed with the rapturous glow of patriotism,
have already been translated to brighter worlds ;
to the abodes of more than mortal freedom.â
Other millions have arisen to receive from their
parents and bcnefaflors, the ineltimable recom
mence ot tiheir atchievments. A large propor
tion of the audience, whose benevolence is at
this moment liltening to the speaker of the day,
like him were at thit period too little advanced
beyond the threlhold of life to partake of thÂ«
divine enthufufm which.injured the American
bosom ; which prompted her voice to proclaim
defiance tt> the thunders of Britain ; which con
secrated the banners of her armies ; and finally
erefled the holy temple of American Liberty, o
vcr the tomb of departed tyranny. Itisfiom
those who have alieadv pafied the meridian of
rlife; it is from you, ye venerable aficfters of
the rights of mankind, that we are to be inform
ed, Ahff were the feelings which fwaved with
in your !Â»â¢, alls ar.d impeile'l you fa ailion.whm,
like the tripling of Israel, with scarce a weapon
to attack, and without a fhicld for your defence,
you met, an I u-ijifmayed, engaged with the
gigantic greatness of the Britilh power. Untu
tored in the Jhfgraceful science of human butch
ery ; destitute of the fatal material wliish the
injenuity of man has combined, to (harpen the
fcytlie of death j unsupported by the arm of a
ny friendly alliance ; and unfortified against the
powerful aflaults of an unrelenting enemf, vou
did not hefitne at that moment, when your
foalb w re infeftedb/ a formidable fleet, when
your territories were invaded by a numerous and
veteran army, to pronounce the sentence of eter
nal reparation from Brita : n, and ti throw the
gauntlet at a power the terror of whose recent
triumphs was almost co-extensive with the earth.
The interfiled and felfilh propensities which in
times of p ofperaus tranquility have such pow
erful dominion Â»vir the heart, were all expelled
and in their (lead, the public virtues, the fpfrit
of personal devotion to the common cause, a
contempt of every danger in companion with
the fubierviency of the country, had aflumed an
unlimited control. The pafiion for the public,
had abforhed all the reft as the glorious lumi
nary of heaven extinguilhes in a flood of reful
gence the twinkling fpltndor of every inferior
planet. Those of you my countrymen, who
â¢were aÂ£tors in those interfiling scenes, will best
Iknow, bow feeble, and impotent is the language
of this description toexprefs the impaflioned e-
of the foul, with which you were then
agitated : yet it were injustice to conclude from
thence, or from the greater prevalence of pri
vate and personal motives in these days of calm
serenity, that your sons hive degenerated from
the virtues of their fathers. Let it rather be a
fubjeit of pleafmg reflexion to you, that the
generous and difinterefled energies, you
were summoned to display, are permitted by the
bountiful indulgence of heaven to remain latent
in the bosoms of your children. From the pre
sent prosperous appearance of our public affiirs,
we may admit a rational hope thst our country
will hive no occifion to require of us those ex
traordinary and heroic exertions which it was
yoor fortune to exhibit. But from the common
' verfa'.ility of all human deftiny.fhculd the prof
pe& hereafter darken, and the clouds of public
misfortune thicken to a tempelt; should the voice
of our country's calamiiy ever call us to her re
lief, we swear by the precious memory of the
f ' 'ho toiled, and of the heroes who bled in
1 her defence, that we will prove ourselves not Un
worthy of the prize, which they so dearly pur
chased j that we will sil as the faithful disciples
of those who so magnanimonflv taug-ht us the
inltrudlive lei Ton or republican virtue."

TOTHI PRESIDENT OF the UNITED STATE'S.
Sir,
SOME of us were unborn at the time
'when you at d our fathers solemnly resolved
ion the freedom and independence of our
country. Poffefiiiig, however, those patri
otic feelings, with which you and they were
iinfnired on that important and memorable
Gccafion, we cannot remain insensible and
Went fpeftators, when our dearest inherit
ance is threatened and endang rd. When
we behold that nation (the recolleftion of
whose f"rvices for our country, " in the
times that tried men's fouls" naturally
prompted the grateful orison of fuceefs jn
tilte commencement of their revolution) so
rcgardlefs of the sacred rights df man, as
10 become.the tyrauts of the wnrld ; when

Comp.tft, prosecuting a system of depreda
fcioil on the commerce of ourcountry; when
u e consider their subtle and repeated at-
U mptj to create and organize a party a
-11 oiigft us, whose endeavors have been to
Â» iflead the honed and uninformed citizens,
and thereby disunite them from the govern
-11. Nt of their choice; and when we fee
t tiir shameless avowal of reliance on their
oi/n diplomatic {kill and the French party
tfciiis creattd, to subvert our gcycrnmen
lanJ effeft onr ruin, by calling the odium of
unpopular mtafures on the friends of our
I country sâwe5 âwe feel it ou duty, thus pub-
I liclyand unequivocally, to express our honeit
1 indignation at condudl so abominable and
1 dangerous, and insinuations so undeserved
and degrading.
We therefore take the liberty to afiure
you, Sir, tha (although we do not profefs
1 at our time of !<fr to have acquired much
political knowledge) when we review your
conduft from that memorable aera, when
' you were the co patriot of our fathers, to
| the present i> tcrelling per'od; and especially
i when we confiderth? pacific difoofition you
| have constantly manifi fted in your attempts,
by negotiation, to preserve us from the ca
lamities of war with the French Republic ;
we fee, in your conduft, that firmm si and
wisdom, that patriotism and uniformity,
which jullly entitles you to our unreferv'ed
confidence and approbation. We trull in ;
God, and in that disposition yvhic'i yÂ»u !
have invariably Ihewn, that the impending
storm may yet be averted : but if all con
ciliatory means fh ill be unavailable, and if
it (hall be found neceflaiy, for the pioteftion
and preservation of our liberty and inde
pendence, eventually to appeal to arms ; we
sincerely declare that we will obey, with
alacrity, the call of our country, and afford
our firm support to such measures as may be
adopted for the general welfareâThus (hall
we prove to you, and to the wotld, that we
are neither the dupes nor partizans of any
foreign power on earth.

To the Light Infantry Company of the borough
of Eajlon, in the Jlate of Pennfyfaiania.
Gentlfheh,
I THANK you fdr this addrefj,
which has been presented to me, according
to ycur requell, by Mr. Sitgreaves amd Mr.
Chapman, two of your Representatives in
Congress, with a copy of your resolutions.
rhe praise i f the brave, who will not be
guilty of adulation, is ever pleasing to an
honell car. Though fomc of you were un
born, when your fathers resolved onjnde
pcndence, it is fcarcdy possible.you fiiould
not have received from them, as well as from
your own observation and experience, an
invincible attachment to it, as your dearest
inheritance.
The nation, of whose unfriendly conduft
you complain, have been famous, for many
ages, for insinuating address, diplomatic
ikill, and political invention. In their own
talents, in this kind, they have ever had a
confidence ; which since their revolution has
constantly incYeafed,* until at present they
seem to think they can create and uncreate
charafters, give and take away,'popularity,
at their pleafute. In this country, however,
they have not entirely succeeded ; one re
putation at lead, that of my Prcdeceffor, has
(lood unlhaken and unsullied. Our fejlow
citizens mull support other charafters against
all such attacks, or the cause of truth and
virtue, as well as national independence, will
be loft.
I esteem very highly yonr approbation
and confidence ; founded, as you profefs, on
a review of the patriotism and uniformity
you have found in my conduft, through a
long political career : but the mod accepta
ble of all is your declaration, that you will
obey, with alacrity, the call of your country.

SIR,
A number of the inhabitants of this town
have agreed to build and equip a (hip of three
hundred and fifty-five tons burthen, to be mount
ed with twenty fix-pound cannon, and to offer
her to the government of the United States for
their life, they have also voted thai they will not
accept of any farther or other compensation from
j the government than an interest of fix per cent
per annum on the Victr cost of the ship and equip
ments, and a filial rcimburfemen.t,* at the conve
nience of government of the said nett cofl, and
â¢ they have appointed us a committee to inform
you of their ntenuons, and to requefl you to
promote a provifiou whtreby they may be ena
-1 bled to carry their defignl into execution by the
countenance of government so far as the fame
shall appear neceftary. AÂ« we indulge a hope
that this intentiprfof- the citizens of Newburv
xport will lead to proportionate exertions in larger
and wealthier towns, we beg leave'to fuggett the
convenience that any provision which may be
thought proper and applicable to the cafe might
be general. The inhabitants &f this town at the
prelent moment are animated u'ith the raoft zea
lous rel'olutioti to support and defend with their
lives and properties thf government of their
â¢ country as well agsinft the open attacks of fo
reign enemies as the insidious attempts of do
meltic traitors, they heartily wish their abilities
extended beyond their present offer, but the im
mense ravages which have been committed on
their property by sea, and the great proportion
of the remnant yet at rifle forbids their further
indulgence of their inclinations. It may be that
under a late axfl of government authorizing the
executive to purchase (hips of war the present
beclofe j without legislative aid, if
Inch should be your opinion we wish you to lay
.the plan before the executive, and we (hall be
the more gratified in this way as the whole busi
ness may probably be thus cor.fiderably expedit
ed. The materials are already in forwardnefs
and provisional contratfs will be entered into so
that probably in ninety days from our receiving
aflurance that government patronizes our design
the ship may be afloat; the best calculations we
hive bce.n able to make of the whole expence
reduces it below thirty thousand dollars and if
the utmost attention to ceconomy and dispatch
caivefledt any the cost frill finally fall con
fide,rably within that sum.
Among thÂ£ good'effe<sUef the present propo
sal we have contemplated, th at in this way gov
ernment may at this period when-fo many calls
for money exist, procure the means of defence,
without actual advances perhaps with more
promptitude and undoubtedly with, considerably
lefÂ» expence than writhe common mode of 'con

Tothi PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
SIR,
AT a time when you are receiving from every
part of the Union, testimonies of rclpeft for -your
chara&er* and approbation cf your measures, per
mit the young men of the city of New York, to join
the general voice of .heir countrymen, and express
to Aouthe gratitude, elitem and confidence with
which yourcoodutfc has infui ed them .
We have r.cu the vanity to suppose. that the ap- ,
pjaufe of inexperienced youth, car. afford any ! igh
gratification to your mir.d, conscious as it must be of
its own integrity and resources. In fcafons of peace
and tranquility, welhculd have been retrained by
that diffidence becoming our years irom mingling in
affairs which have been committed to abler hands.â
But in the hour of danger when our shOres arc threat
ened With ravage by the republic of France, andoui
configured authorities.with diflolufion ; when ou;
political rulers ate treated with indignity, and we
with our fellow citizens changed with disunion ana
diiaffeftion to our government, a fer.fe of truth & the
feelings which our wrosgs have excited, induce us
thus publicly to declare our unshaken attachment to
our coumry, and our determined lefolution to fur
port those measures which its adrniniftration may dt
reft or advise for its security;
We once weie attached to France, it was an enthu
fiafin in favor of liberty. If that enthufialm has ever
drawn irom us in comnv-.n with some of our coun
trymen demonftrat.-.ons of attachment upon which its
rulers have founded their belief, that we are unfriend
ly to cut government, we collider it as a cause of re
gret, but we assure you, that the fame enthufnfm
now unites us m ire ciofely in the defence of our
country, and irilpires us with a spirit of resistance a
ga nft thc\ efforts of that repub ; icto delfroy oiir inde

ANSWER,
Tathe YOUNG MEN of the city of New York.
CINTLZMIN,
I RECEIVE ih-s becoming, amiable and judicious
1 address, from the Young Men of thfrcity of Ncw-
Yoik, with great plcafure.
The fituari-.n in which nature has placed your state,
its numerous advantages, and its population so ra
. j.idly increasing, render it of great importance to the
I Union of the nation, that its youth (houldf be pof
ft fied of good principles and faithful dilutions
j The fpccimen you have given in this address could
not be more fatisfa&ory.
I assure you, my young friends, that the fatisf-c
tion with my conduftj.wh'ch has been ex pre (Fed by
the rifmg generation has been one of :he highfft
gratifications I ever received ; because if I hive not
been deceived in my own motives, I can finceiely
fay, that their haopinefs and that of their pofteritv.
more than my own, or thit of my Cotemporaries has |
been the objtft of the ftndies and labors of my life.
Your attachment to France was in common with
Americans in generalâthe enrhufiafm for liberty
which contributed to excite it was in sympathy with
great part part of the people of Europe. The cau- I
fts which produced thai great event were so extensive i
through the European world and so long eftabliftied j
that muft appear a vast scheme of Providence, j
marching to its end, at a great superiority over the
{â¢ views, designs, hopes and fears of individuals or na- j
! tions, kings or princes, phil (Yphers or statesmen.
. It would be weak to alcrioe the glory of it, or im*
ppte the blame to any individual or any nation, it
would be equally abfard for any Individual or nation
to pretend to or pow.r. eq'ialto the mighty
task of arresting its progrefi or diverting its c u le.
May the human rare in general, and the French na
tion in particular, derive ultimately from it an ame
lioration of their condition, in the extension of lib
erty civil and religious, in increased virtue, wifdâ¢im I
* and humanity. For myfelf, however, I confets, L
fee not how, nor when, nor where. In the mean
time, tbefeiacompreh-nfible fpecula'ions ought n>>t
to influence ourcondu& In any degree It is our du
ty to judge bv the standard of tru h, integrity ar>d
conference, of what is right and wrong, to contend
for our own rights, and to fight for own altars and
! fireflies, as much as at any former period of our lives,
or in the history of the world. In your own beauti
ful and p-thetic language, the fame ecthuliafm ought
now to uniteus more ciofely, in the defence of our
country and inspire us with a spirit of a
gainft the efforts of that republic to destroy our inde
pendence. If my enthusiasm is not mo r e extravagant
than yours has ever, been, our independence will be 1
one eflential inftrurtient for reclaiming the fei>nented
world, and bringing good out of the mas. of evil.
The refpeft vou acknowledge to your parent* is
one of the best or {ymptoms. The ties of father,
son and brother, the sacred bands of marriage, with
out which those connections would be no longer dear
or venerable, callon you and all our youth to beware
of contaminating your counrry with the foul abomi
nations of the French revolution ~ -
