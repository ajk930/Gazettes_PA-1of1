The C emmiffioners
carrying into efle.2 the Cith article of the
X treaty of amity, comim rce and navigation, con
cluded between his Briunoic imjejty and the United
_ States of America, en the 19th day of November,

purfuaut and agreeibfy to the said treaty, u. \sre
by give notice, that tliey arc ready to proceed tÂ»
bullncfs accordingly; and they desire that all claims
under the said article (which so far as the faaie de
scribes the cases thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
1 hey further deiire that all such claims may not
only-date in what manner the several cases come
j within the defcriptioH of the said article, but also
especially fit forth .he nature of the evidence by
, which the claimants relpedtively undertake tofub
ftantiatc the fame.
Exjraft from the said article,
" Whereas it is alledgcd by divers Britilh mer
" chants, and ethers his majesty's fubjedts, that
" debts to a conildcrable amount, n hich were bona
" fide contracted, befpre the peace, still remain
" owing tÂ« them by citizens or iahibitants of tile
" United States; and that by the operation of va
" rious lawful impediments, since the peace, not
" only the full recovery of the said debts has been
" delayed, but also the value and security thereof
" hive been in several Instances impaired and (ess
" ched, so that by the ordinary course of judicial
" proceedings, the Britifii creditors cannot now
_ " obtain and actually have and receive full and
" adequate compensation for the-lofts and dama
" ges which tncy have thereby luf ain-d: It is a
" greed that in all such cases where full compenfa
-11 tion for such lolTes and damages cannot for what
" ever reafou be aÂ£lu illy obtained, had and recei
" ved by the said creditors in the ordinary course
" of justice, the United States will make full and
" complete compensation for the fame to the said
" creditors: but it is dil'tindly understood, that
" this provision is to extend to such losses only as
" have been occasioned by the lawful impediments
" aforefaid, and is not to extend to lofles occasion
" ed by such infolvcncy of the debtors or other
" causes, as would equally have operated to pro
" duce such loss, if the said impediments had not
" existed ; nor to such lofies or damages as have
" been occasioned by the manifeft delay, ornegli
" gencc, or wilful omiifion of the claimant."

the Directory reprelcnted to the legislature, theft,

would be to give their o wn_ opinions, 'their

IT has been often said that the chief use
of history is, to teach ly experience. This
is just and true ; but the application of ge
neral truths to particular cases is not unfre
quently made too late, or not made at all.
For example, our affairs at this moment e
vince how little our enlightened nation were
prepared, either by reading or observation,
for the events it fuffers and deplores.
Almoll every one makes it an occasion of
surprise that the French have so terribly used
and abused their influence in America. It
would b? ten times more strange if they had
not. Foreign influence in a State has not
been, nor will be, (for indeed it cannot be)
productive of any thing but abuse. It is
of the nature of the doctrine of slavery,
whose foundation is in wrong, and every act
is injury. The lot of a slave may be to
have a kind matter, yet a tyrant's mercy i 3
not to be confounded with liberty. It is
very true the conduÂ£t of France tends to nu
such confufion iÂ« our ideas, for her tender
mercies are cruelty-
During our revolution war, our minds
were heated hotter than red hot iron by the
pal Eons of the contefl. Then when the
fabflance was foftened, France made the
impression ; it has since cooled, but it re
mains. Her conduft has at last opened our
eyes, and we fee that the treaty of 1778
was a Jewish bargain. For an aid in her
ships, troops, and money, very trivial, con
sidering her power, and the ardency of her
wishes to fever the Briti/h empire, she exafts
the eventual guarantee of her Weft Indies,
a condition of the hardest kind, the molt
unequal, the moll contrary to our pacific
commercial policy, the most subversive ,of
our wife, neutral and independent charafter
that could be imagined. The alarms and
distresses of the moment made us overlook
such a flipulation. Cooler reflection points
out its future danger to our peace jcommercc
and fafety.
This oversight is one proof (and that at
the very ou%fet) of the mifchiefs of foreign
connexion.
1 But the main objeft of these remarks is
to draw men of reading into notice, that the
whole current of historical fafts is a warning
against foreign influence.
Among the ambitious repubb'csof Greece,
the condition of allies was slavery. Athens,
like France, decorated the temples of her
Gods vrith pictures and ftatucs by forced
contributions irom. her ulliis. Sparta every
where the ariftocratitf faftioa in
the Grecian cities, and Athens the demo
cratic, and each by turns cut the others
throats. Some of our democrats pretend
to be philosophers. Let them read Thu
cydides.
Rome forced her alliance, {Word in hand,
upon the then civilized world, and after
wards by her Genets and Adets prcfcribed
to the nations the duties of allies or citi
zens. Of ill the conditions of slavery, it
was the molt wretched. The oppressor had
no feelings of compassion, the oppressed no
resources of defence. The despots did-not
tonfider their allies as their (laves whom they
had an intertft to spare, but as victims va
lued for their Ik ins and their fat. Holland,
Brabant, Geneva, Genoa, Venice, and
Ronit, as well as Spain and Sardinia drink
deep of the bitterness of this cup of humi
liation
Greece and Rome, as modern France, firft
sowed the feeds of intestine discord before
they reaped the harvest of power and plun
der in a Hate. They brought a nation
whom they would plunder and enslave firft
to the brink of a civil war, then, by siding
with one of the parties, forced the other to
accept of their alliance.
The ancient Britons in like manner intro
duced the Saxons, who soon picked a quar
rel with them, because they had not, as they
said, been well used as allies. They accor
dingly proceeded to carve out of the coun
try their own recompense. This produced
the longed and bloodiest struggle recorded
in history, and ended in the extirpation of
the Britons who had ra(hly called in the
Saxons to meddle in their affairs.
The Saxons themselves Come hundred
years after invited the Danes to allift in a ci
v;l war, and these allies also became tyrants
and masters.
The influence of the Pope in England in
the days of King John and Henry third is
more direftly analogous to the mifchief of
French influence, because like the latter it
was founded in prejudice and well intention
ed error, and in like manner was perverted
to the purposes of ambition and faftion.
Religion was then the pretext, as liberty is
now. The Engliih people being bigoted
catholics, the power of the Pope over the
i mind was greater than the king's. John,
by attempting to support his authority a
j gainst the Pope, was humbled by the fac
tion in league with him. When, however,
in 1216, John, to the eternal disgrace of
| his memory, gave up his crown to Cardinal
| Pandolfo, the Pope's legate, and took it -
1 back again as the vassal of the holy fee,
then he found papal protection. The eccle
siastical thunders were launched against the
very fame nobles whom they had before as
sisted to dethrone the monarch, and to. up
hold that very defpotilm which they had for
a time subverted by the great charter of En
gliih liberties,
i The Pope's influence was used incor.fill
ently in appearance, but in ftrift- conformity
with the nature of all foreign influence, to
! facrifice .every thing to itfelf. Engliih liberty
was every thing, till the king and power
' became the Pope's, and thep Engliih liber-
I ty was treason and. ihipiety.
Thus lately our independence was every
thing, when the question was" to fever us
; from Great Britain. But when our treaty
was made to get back our captured ships
and cargoes, our detained polls, to quench
the flame of an Indian war, and to prevent
the kindling of a more extensive snd wafte
ful one with Britain, then our independence
was the fin of ingratitude. We had no
right to make such a treaty, as if we had
not gained our independence, or had gained
it from only, and not from France.
King Henry, John's successor, through
his whole reign of 56 years, submitted to
be the tool and dupe of the Pontiff of Rome,
who in return abetted his despotism, and
both robbed the miserable people, How
England was beggared and coaVulfed in con
sequence, let men of letters read for them
selves, and tell their unlettered fellow citi
zens for their inftruftioq and warning.
One consequence, and a comforting one
itis, maybedrawnfrom thehiftory of Henry
the third, that when foreign influence was
pushed beyond all bounds of (hame on one
fide and patience on the other, the spirit of
the nation rose, though very slowly, and
produced such solid securities for the magna
charta, or great charter, that ail the liberty
of England is inherited from it.
In like manner the 4th of July 1776
gave us a right to be free and independent.
But the abuses of French influence alone
have matured the spirit and temper without
which that ever famous aft would be no bet
ter than France considers it, parchment and
â¢wax. A Reads*.

it had been so. Still less was he prepared to
point out any mflance in which it had not.
That the British treaty in particular, tho'
it might be unfavorable to France in its ope
ration, was not intended by the government
to be so, and gave no just ground of complaint
to Fraoce.
That the Executive is at this time fiocere

FROM A CORRESPONDENT.
Any man who has lived loHg enough to be
able to recolledt, or has read of the hif
iory of France, to form any jull idea of it for
the lalt forly years, and the deep adverlities of
it, from the year 1763 to the year 1774, dur
ing wh:ch period, that nation lay in a kind of
lethargy, mourning over the train of its misfor
tunes j how the people were depcefled in their
own estimation, and in the coniideration of all
Europe ; in what contempt they were held by-
Great Britain ; their commerce and marine al
molt annihilated, their manufadtures languish
ing, and their finances in confufion ; that
the year 1774 and the moment of the meeting
of our Congress in the city of Philadelphia,
seemed to be the commencement of their refur
redtion to importance , That the spirit of
their nation then began to revive, and ;heir
hopes io ipriug up ; that they began then a
â gain to feel their own energy, to be again con
sidered .n Europe, and to believe, that the dif
memberinsnt of the Britilh empire, would be
the Salvation of France: That the period
was then arrived when it would have been scarce
poflible for them or Spain to have avoided ano
ther war with Great Britain, without an hope
of success, or any thing but disgrace and de
feat; That Seizing on the opportunity of
tha American revolution ; and even courting
and Soliciting underhand, an alliance with us,
they carried on ail easy war, and undisturbed
at land re-eftablilhed their marine : That by
our aid, they have both in the lift war and this
derived afilltance from the Dutch whom no
thing but the American independence would
have eVer induced to take that part rhat
the Americans since the revolution in France,
have maintained a magnanimous neutrality,
from which France has received a valt affiltance
from our trade; that the United States were
the fir ft power of the world to acknowledge
their independence and receive their miniftcr
with a promptitude to which ho treaty nor any
law of nations obliged them, which had by no
means been exemplified towards us by France
who compelled our ministers (with a Franklin,
one of the mail conl'picuoiia charadlers in the
warld at their head) to renuin in obfeurity and
danger in Paris, for more than a year before
they were received ; that we have fulfilled

From -he Au 'ruri. â â 
Agcntkrr.au in this city is informed by; a
letter from his friend in Virginia, tlut file
condufl of the grand jury at Richmond, who
prefeoted colonel Cabell, is universally
bated through the. llate, and has added.tji the
colonel' 3 friends.
It is due to truth to inform, that the jury
was much deceived, and the majority, no
doubt, made up of the friends to Gieat-Bri
tain, and the enemies to information.
Obferiatiors on the above by a correspondent.
The grand jury, who made the present.
oient above alluded to, was, in truth, com
posed of the moll tcfpe&able-and independent
farmers and planters in the Hate. Many of
them were formerly strong advocates in be
half of the French, but, since the develope
ment of their views, have become convinced
of the necefliiy of ftipporting our own. go
vernmentâa change in sentiment which has
very generally taken place in Virginia.
Circular letters, signed by S. J. Cabell,
were submitted to the grand jury, and it was
from a view of their contents, that they were
fligmatized at tending " to disseminate (la
founded calumnies ajrainfl the happy govern
ment of the United States, and thereby to
Separate the psople therefrom ; and to in
crrife or p oduce a foreign influence, ruinous
to the peace, happiness aud independence of
these United States."
A similar presentment has been made by
the grand jury of a diltrift court of the Rate
at Dumfries, and from this faÂ£t, the public
may judge of the truth of the aflertion " that
the conduit of the grand jury at Richmond,
who presented colonel Cabell is univetfally
reprobated thro' the slate."
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
The Editor of the Salem Gazette, fays,
"We offer to the public an Address of
President Adams at the opening of Con

while there is a precision, which is admira
ble. He has combined very noble senti
ments. He awakens a sense of national ho
nor, while he establishes the most deliberate
wisdom. He feels every indignity offered
to these States, while he permits no resent
ment unfriendly to peace. He calls for de
fence. while he employs negociation. He
commends a policy, which has our ownprof
perity, and not the prejudices of foreign
nations, as its obje<&. In this critical con
junfture, when all eyes are turned towards
hijp he has conciliated the affedtions, and
possessed the confidence of the U. States.â
Long live the President."

CONGRESS.
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES,
THURSDAY, MAY 24.
Mr. Gallatin said the debate had
been extended into so wide a field, that the
object which iti his mind occupied the firft
place, was in some measure deprived of that
full consideration which time and circum
stances demanded : he thought those argu
ments which concerned the conduct of for
eign nations towards each other, might as
well have been omitted altogether on the
present occasion ; the members of the com
mittee may be made sensible of the irritation
of such discussions, but he believed no one
would pretend to fay he was fully informed
of foreign concerns on either fide, to decide
upon their policy Or impolicy-âat the fame
time it (hould be considered, that our own li
tuation and the bell pfllicy to be pursued in
that situation, are the only proper objefts of
our immediate attention, and those alone
upon which we can pretend to be properly
informed, or to decide with effect.
The quellion before the house was- the
amendment proposed by the gentleman
from Virginia ; and in" conlidering that a
mendment he iVould neither criticise upon
terms nor dispute about any of the nice de
licacies of dictionâthese he considered of
but very small consequence indeed, and he
cared not whether gentlemen fliould prefer
sensibility to indignation, or the contrary â
so that the fubitantial ends of our delibe
rations (hall be accomplished, and in a way
the most conducive to our national honor and
security : he did not pretend to censure
gentlemen for the excursive manner in which
they had debated on the amendment ; âhe
only fixed it as a rule for himfelf to adhere
closely to it ; and this he would do by of
fering such observations upon it as occurred
to himfelf, and as arose from the remarks of
other gentleihen ; and he would notice the
latter before the substantial faÂ£ts.
It had been objected to the amendment, 1
that it was couched in language calculated
rather to apologize for the conduct of France
towards us than to assert our injuries ; âthe
paragraph objedted to was in these wordsâ
" but we flatter ourselves that the Govern
ment of France intended only to propose
the ordinary diplomatic intercourse, and to
bring into operation those extraordinary
agencies which are in common use between
nations, and which are confined in their at
tention lo the great cSjedts of difference
this is considered by some gentlemen as an
apology for the difmiflion of our Minister ;
he would observe upon this objection very
brieflyâhe would not enquire whether our
Minilter had ordinary or extraordinary pow
ers, but he would" consider that part of the
amendment in that point of view in which
theft j*ain > di/JVr*erice "of opinroaâW* til
â >' l Tr4e;riiri.Mr. Piack:flc.'y has been difniiffed,
aiuiiicf one has said that we Ihould not, nor
-thst we ire precluded from further negocia
tipn,. the Spec.ch of the'Pi-efideiit with the
fcntimeuts of every gentlf man' of the Com
uiktee are united j the amendfh'ent then appear
ed to him as an expreflio'n of that principle,
and he believed that nothing more nor less
than-thgt opinidn could be found in it.
.â¢ Let .us now re'tiiark upon the arguments
against the other part of the amendment: A
gentleman frorfl South Carolina (Mr. Smith'-)
has told us that possibly Mr. Pinckney hid
extraordinary powers/and as he was difmiT
fed we should not agree in that amendment
while we agree iff the principle of further
nt'gociation, he could not diicfrn the appli
cation of this obje&ion ; but will it be said
that Mr. Pinckney Had extraordinary pow
ers, and that he could not treatâsurely that
would not be maintained ; He would take
upon him to assert that he had not extraor
dinary powers, because if he had, the Pre
sident would either haVe told us he had, or
furnifhed us with a copy of them : and above
all because had he such extraordinary pow
ers there would have been no alternative For
us between submission and war.
Another gentleman (Mr. Sit greaves) had
said that he had no reliance on the magnani
mity or the justice of France, that he would
not trust to her as disposed to reconciliation,
and yet thegentleman is disposed to support
that part of the report which approves the
purpose to negociate ; he believed that such
declarations were not the best of all others
to ensure or even to promote a spirit of re
conciliation ; if we were injured We should
not be the less so for a dispassionate represen
tation of our injuries ; and inimofity is at
the best of times an inauspicious temper to
negociate under ; he believed if we should
be fiucere on both fides that our disputes
would have an amicable termination, and if
we mean to evince our sincerity that we
ought to be unequivocal.
He would now take up what he deemed
to be the' substantial part of the Addrefs 1 ;
he thought it should contain in One shape or
another, a declaration of the disposition to
place France on an equal footing with every
other nation, and having found it in the a
mendment, it was with him an additional &
powerful reason for supporting-itâit fays,
" We therefore receive with the utmost fat
"isfaftion your information, that a frefl) at
" tempt at negociation will be instituted
" and we expeft with confidence that a mu
" tual spirit of conciliation and disposition
" on the part of the United States to place
" France on the footing of a their countries
"by removing the inequalities v/hich have
" arisen in the operation of our. refpe&ive
"treaties, &c. See." In speaking of this
part of the amendment it may be rieceffary
to notice an objeftion which had been made
to the discussion of the fubjeft in that house,
upon the principle of the Constitution, that
the President with the and confjnt of
the Senate, are alone c&mptte# t and autho
rifedto consider and determine upon'foreign
â relations ; would'geffflefnen, then .fey that
this house is precluded frpm the freeexercife
of opinion on the most interesting cpnceri s
of "the nation, will they fay that the Repre
sentatives of the People (hall have-no voice
or deliberative weight in questions which go
to decide whether peace (hall be p/xferved
or war rendered inevitable ? Until they
do assert this, or at least until the Constitu
tion declares it, for it is so far fortunate that
the Constitution is much stronger than those
gentlemen : Until they declare this* in the
face of the Constitution, it will be the duty
of that house to disregard such far-fetched
doftr/'nes, and to deliberate fully ; but sup
posing that the house should resolve to ex
press an opinion in terms more strong, or ; s
itrong as they poflibly could be expressed,
and inform the President that we wished for
peace on such and such terms ; gentlemen
must know that the President is not bound
by the Constitution to adopt our counlel
we have the right to declare our opinion, he
has the right to aft ; but if he afts contra
ry to the national opinion, it must be upen
his own responsibility : It is clear, there
fore, that we do not interfere wish his du
ties ; we do not usurp his fun&ions, and
there can be very little reason to fufpeft that
the President will step out of the line of his
duties, or depart from the plans which
his wisdom has formed, in consequence of
any vote which we may pass, if it appears
to him in itfelf wrong ; if gentlemen would
indeed reft upon the authority of precedent,
and that derived from foreign and diffimil: r
Constitutions, it would not be difficult, to
cover the table with quotations,' from fcr
eign Parliamentary proceedings, direclly iiy,
the teeth of their afluinptions, and these too
from bodies whose rights were not so exten
sive ; whose Constitutions were not so free
as ours - ; gentlemen who insist on
precedent, and upon British-Parliamentary
precedent too, appear not to know or to
forget, that it was a vote of the British
House of Commons, which terminated the
American war ; srrd on a later but less im
portant occasion, that it vha a vote of the
House of Commons that" ftrminated the
Ruffian armament, which waa a cafe not ve
ry remote from a refemblante of the prefe; t
flute of our own affairs : But gentleniem as
if conscious of the futility of thtfe assump
tions, abandon them for another kind cf ar
gument ; they fay our exnreffion of cfir
opinion betrays a want of f onfidence in the
Executive ; this argument would do very
well in countries where the Executive was
every thingand the people nothing; or where
deliberation was only'a form and not a es
sence } but in our free Government, he dij
not know which to admire, the ftrangcueU
or tbe incongruity of the do&rine : He
thought that so far from betraying a want of
confidence, he was fully persuaded thePri
fident was then waiting anxiously for the
opinion of that House, or at least to kuow
the opinions cf the people, his wishes are for
peace, but he is also desirous of ascertaining
how far he (hall be supported in the negoci
ation? which are to iVcure it; and thi- difposition and thia are thÂ« Beeewjry re- j wl
â¢ ''lt of h:s fitUltion j he would remind gen- | ini
tleir.ea, that fix, fcven, or eight weeks have ev
elapfcu since the President received advice of Us
the (hfnnjiion of our Miniier, and vet to O
this hour he has oot taken any steps beside en
the calling of the Legislature together, to- m
wards that negociatioa; what does he fay
to us " believing <r.ei:ber the honor, nor the in. m
Urtfi cf the Vmted States abfolvtrly forbid the or
repetition of advances for feeuring theft desirable hi
ofjety with France, IJhall institute a frejh at- d<
tempt at negotiation, and shall not fell to pro
mote and accelerate art accomodation, on nc
terms compatible with the rights, duties, in- fe
tereft, and honor of the nation. If we have pt
committed errors, and these can be demon- e<i
grated, we /hall be willing to corredl them ; if
if we have done injuries, we shall be willing p<
on conviction to redress them, and equal pi
measures of justice, we have a right to expeft
from France and every other nation." From m
this explicit declaration of the opinion and
intentions of the Executive, he concluded h(
that it was a principal obje& to obtain a pre- aj
clfc knowledge of the feelings of the Ame
rican people, and that cannot be done in any ac
shape with a greater likelihood of certainty d<
than in that House. r m

Saturday, June 3. i th
Mr* Venable, from the committee ap- S'
pointed to wait on the President, to know
wheri and where he would receive the Ad- P'
dref3 of the House of Representatives in
answer to his Speech to both houses at the
opening of the session, reported that they
had waited on the President, and that he re
had appointed this day at twelve o'clock to j*'
receive the address.at his own house.
The Speaker informed the house that in f y
consequence of the inconveniences which
member? had felt from the increased heat of,
the weather, and owing to the great num
ber of grangers which attended the house, j ro
he had been induced to give directions, that :
after this say, the southern part of the cn
' house foould no longer be appropriated to nc
strangers, but that the north end. alone, and Fl
the gallery would be open for that purpose,
until the house should direct to the contra
ry. The order was confirmed. pi
A report was received from the commif- 2e
fion<rs of the Federal city,"which was order- p<
ed to be printed. pt
Mr. Lyon said, he yesterday voted against "
the appointment of a committee to wait u- th
pon the President to know when and where
he would receive their address, because he ft
believed the President should always be rea- â¢
dy to receive important communications.â J
He wished to make a motion, which was, , rt
' " thatfueh members as did not chufe to at* j
tend upon the President to present the an- I Sl
fwer to his speech, shall be excused." He d
wilhed'to be understood. He thought the n
motion a reasonable one, because it proposed 11
to leave them at liberty to do as they pleased. 11
And by the rules he saw, he was obliged to p
attend, except sick, or leave of absence was c
obtained ; now as he hoped not to be sick "
he wished to put himfelf out of the power of a
the Sergeant at Arms, if he did not attend, si
Hehad been told, he mightftay behind with- 1
out being noticed ; but this was not enough
for him, as he was a timid man, and the r
House had the law on their fide, as he re- r
recollefted something of a reprimand which 0
had been given to Mr. Whitney (Thefpeak- '
er reminded him it was out of order to cen- si
(lire the proceedings of the house on any c
former occasion.) He said he flood correct- c
ed and proceeded. He had spoken, he said, {
to both fides of the House, (as they were r
called) on the fubjetSt. One fide difluaded f
him from his motion, and laughed at it ;
the other fide did not wish to join him in it, j
because it would look like difrefpeft to the j
person lately elected, who was not a man of '
their choice, but be trusted our magnani- f
mous President would, with the enlighten- (
cd yeomanry of America, despise fucha boy- 1
ifh piece of business. This, he said, was no '
new fubjeftwith him, he hadlong heard the <
folly of the wi.t made a matter of wonder '
in this refpeft. It was said, this was not 1
the time to abolish the custom ; but this was j
the cant used against every kind of reform. 1
JSfo better time could ever arrive, he said, 1
than this, which was the threshold of a new J
presidency. at a time when the man elefted ,
to the office was beloved and revered by his
fellow cytizens ;he was as yet unused to vain '
adulation ; he had spent a great part of his \
life ansongft a people, whose love of a plain- 1
L'nefs of manners forbids all Pageantry ;he 1
would be glad to fee the custom done away.
Were he aaing inhis own perfonalcharacter,
he perhaps might conform to the idle usage,
but aÂ£ting as he was for 80,000 people, e
vcry father of a family in his diftridt would
condemn him for such an act.
The gentleman from Connefticut yester
day hctped there would be American blood e
nough f *> carry the question. (The speak
er again reminded him that he was out of
order to allude to what was done yesterday,
and said the proper motion would be to res
cind the rule, he said, only so much of it as
obliged the house to attend. This he said,
was no trifling thing with him, he should
have as great an objection to attend this bu
siness, as a Quaker would to make his'obei
fapce to a magistrate. (The Speaker said
he Biuft move to rescind the rule, or that he
himfelf be excused, no other motion was in
order.) Then he laid, he mult confine him
felf to the narrow ground of himfelf. He
had no obje&ion to gentlemen of high blood
v carrying this address. He had no pretensi
ons to high bloody though he thought he had
as good blood as any of them, as he wp.s born
of a fine hale, healthy woman. Before yes
terday, he never heard of gentlemen boaft
mg of their blood in that house. He could
not fay,' it was true, that he was descended
from the bastards of Oliver Cromwell,
or-his Courtiers, or from the Puritans, who
punifned the horses for breaking the sabbath,
or from thpfe who persecuted the Quakers,
or hanged the witches. He couid, how
ever, fay that this was bis country, because
he do. oilier : and lie owned a share of it,
which he had bought l>y means of kcneft <â 
industry ; he had fought for hisrcountry. In 1
every day of he had repaired to her 1
standard, and had conquered under it.â *
Coaqueft had Ted his C9untry to independ- ;
ence, and being independent, he called no t
man's blood in question.. ii
Mr- Bloukt said he had seconded the t
motion of the gentleman from Vermont, in 1
order to give him an opportunity of slating
his reasons for making it, and not from asy /
desire to rescind the rule.
Mr. Dana obfe.ved that the house would I
not wish to. do violence to the gentleman's <
feelings. It was true sortie of the moil ref
peftable men in the United Statej, had wait- 1
edupon the President in a similar way, yet,
if the gentleman thought it would not com- t
port with his own dignity to do it, he ho- ,
ped he would be exc.ufed: â 
The motion was put and carried unvni
motifly.
The Speak er informed the houft? that the '
hour was arrived at which the President had
appointed to receive them.
Mr. Macon moved that thehoufe do now j
adjourn. He (hould wait upon the Presi
dent ; but it seemed to be nnderftood that I
members were obliged to go. He thought, '
however the power of the house might ex- '
tend to bringing a member into the house, ,
there was no power to carry him out. Ne
gatived without a division. i
The house -then withdrew, and waited u
pon the President of the United States with 1
the following address :
To the PRESIDENT of the United States. '
c J I
Sir,
THE inleierting detail of those eÂ«Â«nts, wilich Have
rendered the convention of Congress at thii time in
difpcnfable, (communicated in your fpeecb to both 1
house*) has excited in ui (he ftiotigelt emotions.
Whilfl we regret the occasion, we cannot omit to tefli
fy our apDrobatior of the measure. and to pledge our
selves that no conliderations of private inconvenience,
(hall prevent, on our part, a faithful difchatgc of the
duties to which we aie called.
We have constantly hoped, that the nationsjof Eu
rope, whilfl defolatcd by foreign warÂ», or intestine
divisions, .would have left the United States to enjoy
that pcice and tranquility, to which the impartial
eondutl ef our Government had entitled ui; and it ii
now with extreme regret, we find the measures of the i
French republic tending to endanger a situation so dc
firable and interefling to our country -
Upon this occasion, we feci it our duty to express,
in the mofl explicit manner, the sensations which the
present ciifis has excited, and to allure yeu of our
jealous co-operation in those measures which may ap
pear ricceffary so our security or peace
Although it it the earned wish ot our hearts, that
peace may be maintained with the French republic,
and with all the world ; yet we never will (urrender
those tights which belong to us as a nation: and whilll
we view wi.h fati-faftion the wisdom, dignity, and "
moderation, which have marked the measures of the
supreme executive of our country, in its attempts to
remove, by candid explanations, the complaints and
jealousies of France, we (eel the full force of that in
| dignity which has been offered to our country in the
i rejeftion of its minister.
So attempts to wound our rights as a Sovereign
J State will escape the notice of our constituents : they
will be felt with indignation, and repelled with that
decision, which fhalj convince the world that we are
not a degraded people ; that we can never submit to
the demands ot a foreign power, without examination
aud without difcuflion.
Knowing, as we do, the confidence rrpofed by the
people of the United States in their government, we
cannot hefitatc in cxprcfTing our indignation at any Sen
timents tending to derogate fronijthat confidence.
Such sentiments, wherever entertained, serve to evince
an imperfeft knowledge of the opinions of our con
flituents. An attempt to separate the people of the
United States from their Government, is an attempt
to separate them from tbemfelves ; and although foi
eiguets who,know not the genius of our country,
may have conceived theprojctl, and foreign emiflaries
mav attempt the execution, yet the united efforts of
our fellow.citizens will convince the world of its im
practicability.
Sensibly as we feel ths wound which has been in.
fliÂ£lÂ«d by the tranfafttonsdifclofed in your communi
cations, yet we think with yÂ®u, thar neither the hon
our nor the interefl of the United States forbid the re.
petition of advances for preserving peace. We there
fore receive with the utmolt fatisfa&ion, your infor
mation that a trefh attempt at negociation will be in
diluted ; and we cherish the hope that a mutual fpiiit
of conciliation, and a difpofltion cn the part of
Trance to compensate for'any injuries which may have
been committed upon our neutral rights, and on the
part of the United States to place France on grounds
â¢ similar to those of other countries, in their relation
and connection with us, if any inequality shall be
found to rxift, will produce an accommodation com
patible with the rights, duties and honor of the U
nitcd States. Fully, hawever, impressed with the
unceruinty of the result, we lhali prepare to meet
1 with fortitude any unfavorable events which may oc
cur, and to extricateourfelvcs from their conftquences
with all the flc.i'l we pofTefs, and all the efforts in our
power. Believing with you that the unduft of the 1
goveri.ment has been j.ft and impartial to foreign na- '
' t'onsi that the !Â»ws fÂ«r tht pielervation of peace have
â  been proper, ana that they have been fairly executed,
, the Reprefentativcs of the People do not hesitate to
, declare, that they will give their molt cordial support
. to the execution of principles so deliberately and up
' rightly eitab lulled.
i The many interefling fublcfts which you 'have re.
] commended to our confederation, and which are io
Hrongly enforced .y this momentous occasion, will
3 receive every attention which their importance de
" mands ; end we tiuli that by the decided and explicit
â¢ conduit which wiil govern our deliberations, every
iofuiuation will be repelled which is derogatory to the
honour and independence of our country.
> Permit uÂ», in o''ering this address, to cxprefi our
, fatiafatftion at your promotion to the firlt office in

j pre-eminent talents and patriotism which have
placed you in this diflioguiihcd situation, will ena
ble you to discharge its various duties with satis
" fatSion to yourieif and advantage to our common

of Keprefentatives,
â ' I receive with great fatiafa&ioa, your can did

" You fee the triumph of the Argus

. It is not at all surprising, that the unfor
tunate jState of Georgia (hould be singled
Â» out by our enemies, as the properclt to com
mence their plundering fyflem of war upon ;
indeed the leading chnraftirs of our Gov
ernment, appear to be anxiously looking for
ward to the period-that will incorporate
hem with the " terrible Republic." It is
then, and n'ot till then, that the great body
of the citizens will be enabled to diflinguifh
the real friends of good order and govern
ment, from the infernal vipers, who have
stung their repof: for two years pnft. Were
a proof neceflary to lubftantiate the truth of
these observations, we (hould have to trace
no further than to the famous remonllrahce
of the 9th of February last : After reci
ting the many grievances under which the
State laboured from the unprecedented ty
ranny and oppreflion of Congress, it goes
on to observe, " that the great charter of our
liberties, the declaration of Independence,
charged George the Illd as a tyrant, for
raising the condition of new appropriations
of land in the following words : " He has
endeavored to prevent the population of
these Stales for that purpose, refufing to
pass laws to encourage migrations thither,
and raising the conditions of new appropria
tions of land." "The comparison (conti
nues the remonstrance) we are sorry to ob
serve, is but too striking, if not in favor of
the Britilh Government."
This is indeed, as a member of the union,
carrying the principles of expatriation to a
very unusual pitch. But what are we to
think of a man holding a military command,
publicly declaring, that were Ae French to
commence hostilities, he (hould not liefitate
to take a part with them ? We cannpt help
thinking, that the declaration would warrant
an arrest, if the Commander in Chief had
firmnefs, or knowledge of his duty, or in
clination to exercise the authority the Gov
ernment has put into his hands.
By this day's Mail.
NEW-YORK, June 3.
Extract of a letter from the Havannah,
dated May 10.
" Had it not been for the firm and inde
pendent conduit of his excellency the Earl >'
of Santa Clara, the present governor of this j
island, our trade would have been as effe&u- '
ally interrupted with this port as it is alrea- '
dy with the British islands by the piratical''
depredations of the French privateers.
" I formerly mentioned to you, that they
had the afiurance to take two American i
ships in one day, almost under the guns of
the Moro, bound in, and that the governor ;
not only ordered them to be instantly deliv- '
ered up, but accompanied that order by a
severe reprimand to the captains of the pri
vateers ; his excellency has since intimated
te Monsieur Bondeneau, the agent or vice
eonful of the French republic, lately arriv
ed here, that he is determined to preserve the :
intercourse of neutral nations with this port 1
free and uninterrupted, and, whatever may '
be their inftrudtions, that the French cruis
ers are on no account to interrupt any neu
tral veflels bound to or from this port ; and
the agent has (as I am credibly informed)
pafled these orders to the captains of the
French privateers that were in this port,
and no instance has since occurred of their
afting contrary to them.
" The present governor is one of the moil
upright, just and independent men that ever
presided in any part of the Spanish. domin
ions ; and has adopted a system so different
from his predecessors, in the dispatch of
public business, that the tedious delays and
difficulties usually experienced here, and
which had become proverbial, exist no long
er in his department. He is to be seen and
spoke with at all hours, by all ranks of peo
ple, and promises to be the molt popular
governor they have hitherto had in this isl
and.

THE public are requested to take notice, that
the partaerihip which has far sometime sub
sisted bet wean Mathias Slough of Lancaster, and
William Geer, it now diffelved: but, not as M.
Slough insinuates to the public without just cause ;
as will more fully appear by a letter on the fub
je<ft from M. Slough to W. Geer, dated the 29th
December lad. a recital of which is not now deem
ed necessary. Any gentleman who wishes to be
more citcumftantially inf#rmed of the merits of
this business, by applying to W. Geer may have
the perusal ef M. Slough's letter, and then can be i
at full liberty to determine whether or not W. ]
Geer is not perfediy juftifiabie in attaching him
felf to any other person in the profecutioii of the 1
Stage conveyance from Philadelphia to Shippenf
urg, or any other place.
Now from tbe liberal and generous support the
public wore pleased to confer on the firft effort in
this business, William Geer, in conjuntflion with
Messrs. Reily, Weed and Wi'.mer, is determined '
to prosecute and carry it on, with every care, at
tention and iifpatch that a zeal to oblige the pub
lic can possibly exert.
The above company, who are amply provided
j with carriages, horses, and every appurtenance to
1 render the passage Jafe and commodious, inform -
thofs wno wifb to patronize and encourage the
undertaking, that they can take their feats at
George Weed's, the sign Â©f the White Horse,
Market Street, Philadelpfcia, on every Monday
and Friday, to proceed to Lancaster, Harrilburg,
Carliile and Shippenfburg. The fare as hitherto
eftablilhed.
For the further accommodation of the public,
a Stage will start every WedneiiUy from the house
of Samuel Elder, in Harrifburg, arrive at Sun
bury in Northumberland county, every Thursday,
and return from thcÂ»ce and arrive at Harrifburg
every Saturday, so that passengers destined for
Lancaster or Philadelphia, may proceed on Mon-
