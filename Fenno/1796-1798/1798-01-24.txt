Debate tn f'eriign li/ercanrjiiy
'â  IConrinu&iJroni yv&crdsy':.'i*' tettt.l
Mr. obfetTed,.that'ifgentlemen
who thiimowoo had confined theÂ«-
selves (0 the quell ton, and to those coiifiifer
ations on w,kich itfe decVion had ufaally tuTh
ed ; bad they contented themselves with at
tempting to shew that the diplomatic eftabhth
meat was unnccefl'ary in general, or inexpedi
ent at this particular juncture,ie should have
deemed it unnecefiary, and e;ven iinprtff>er,
to add any remarks to .those which he had
yesterday Submitted to the committee : hav
ing then urged those considerations which he
regarded as the most imporlunt in deciding
this quellion. But gentlemen had taken a
wider range. Not content vjrith infilling rhat
the present diplomatic eftablilhment is un
necelfarjr or improper in itfelf, they had
made a formal attempt to fix a legislative cen
. sure 011 the conduft of the executive, and had
added to this a personal attack, of a most il
liberal and unfounded nature, on a gentleman
formerly a member of tke house, but now
holding a diplomatic employment. He said,
unfounded and illiberal, because the faft'al
.ledged against that gentleman, and which
went to charge him with having given a vote
in an important cafe, with a view of protnot
ing his private interest, was not fupportedor
pretended to be supported, .by any kind of
' proof; and because no person of aliberajl or
[â¢> <ieiiÂ«ate mind would
. that magnitude, efpcciaDy agahj ar.
, man, without the most fubfiantial evidence.
For these reasons, Mr. Harper said he (hould
make some additional obferyatiois on what
had fallen from gentlemen in this ft age of the
debate, and chiefly with a view 10 refute,
which he should do in the mo&cudeniable
manner, the accusation so ungeneroufty made
against his former colleague; a refutation
which he was the more inclined to under
take because that gentleman wat three thou
sand miles diftant,and coald notdefend him
felf. But before he vent into tlut refutation,
Mr. Harper said, he would adrert to some
of those things having the appearance of
argument, which had been tdvanced by
gentlemen in favor ofjhe restful-fince he
1 Lire uuitric- âm-RTair theTdle' deciaim>.w
about executive influence, the canger of cor
ruption, and the encreafe of patronage, on
which the changes had now bten rung, and
which had been the constant topic of ha
rasses in all governments cojflituted like
ours from the days of James I. till the present
moment; he considered them a*> unworthy of
answer or regard: Neither now cor heretofore,
were they intended as arguments but were
thrown out merely ad captendum uulgus. They
had hitherto produced nq efeft in this
country, and he was not afrtid Â«f their pro
ducing any because the deferfption of peo
ple who might be denominated uulgus, was
very inconftderable in number here, and the
gr,odfenfe of the great mass had always ena
bled them properly to appreciate, and of course
wholly to disregard, clamours of this kind.
He should therefore now pass them by, as he
had always done before, without an answer;
but on those few positions which approaclfed
towards argument, he should beltow some
few remarks.
One of these had been advanced by the
gentleman from Pennfylvanii'{Mr. Gallatin)
who had made it the basis of almost all his
other observations. It was this : that our
foht'tcal relations were diftinft from our com.
mental relations; which last were managed
by consuls, not by miniflcts ; and that as
confuts would still be employed although the
ministers (hould be discontinued, our com
mercial interests would not fufifer or be nee
lefied.
But was that gentleman yet to learn, amidst
all the research of which the hqufe so often
heard the boast, was he yet to learn that al
most all our political relations, and the whole
of those which were still the fubjeft of dispute,
grew out of commerce? Wai he yet to
learn that our present dispute with one of the
great European powers, grew wholly out of
commercial relations? Vvas he yes to team
that the dispute which we lately fettled with
another great power, was in a great measure
of a commercial nature? It was a fatf, Mr.
Harper said, which fure.'y mutt be known to
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, that we
now have no differences with any nation, nor
even any interfering intsrefts, which are not
commercial. We had formerly a dispute
about boundary with Great-Britain, and an
other with Spain, but both had been fettled.
All our treaties moreover, except in these
two instances, Were founded on commercial
interefls; and commercial interefls Were the
only points by which we touched other na
tions, were the only sources from whence our
political intercourse with' them tfould flow.
And yet the gentleman from Pennsylvania
had affirmed that our political intercourse,
was diftinft from our commercial relations !
These commercial relations he had fur
ther affirmed, were managed by consuls,
from whence he had attempted to establish
the inference that ministers were unnecefTary. ,
Did the gentleman from belieife 1
thishimfelf, or did he hoppâp make thd com- j
mittee believe it ? Or did the affertiori pn?- ,
ceed from that bold reliance on the igno- (
ranee or carelefsncfa of others, whereof ,
that gentleman had giyen so many proofs ? 1
our consuls, as that gentleman mult wall
know, were circunrfcribed in their sphere :
and their powers. They were confined to j
particular towns, were jn very many in- 1
fiances foreigners, enjoyed no salary, except 1
those to the Barbary powers, and pollefled
no public or diplomatic charadej,' Their
functions, row, no â  confined; the
c O N G 'R E S S.
Â»elief of the private wants, and some aflift
ance in the private affairs of marisers and
merchants at the refpeclive places of their
confulatcs. But those great and general
inrerefts of commerce which form the basis
of treaties,, and are among the most iru
'porlanc objefh of national intercourse, and
of the law of nations, are wholly above the
- reach of c*mkriÂ», aixl wholly confined 10 those
â¢ public agents whom we call ministers, and
H'ho alune poffcfs the means, by their cha
radler, by their fittrntiop.'and by their inter
jtourfe vriflt the governments to which they
are sent, of regulating, superintending, and
prefcrving those interefls. Did not the gen
tlenjan Â£row Pennsylvania knew this ? He
did knov it- and yet he had asserted that
our political >nd commercial relations were
wholly di(lin<>,, that the latter were ma
naged by confjls, and that for the pre
fervajtion of our commercial interefls and
rights, ministers were not neceflary . These
afi'ertions, on the flWhfcft examination, va
nished into air, and Itft nothing to be won
dered at, but the bddnefs wherewith they
were made.
If commercial interefls therefore, Mr.
Harper faidi were the basis of all our poli
tical intetcourfe, was it proper to disconti
nue our ministers ? WaÂ«> this a time to leave
our commerce to itfelf in the various coun
tries wberp it was snrried on, or even to
weaken onr means of supporting and pro
tecting it ? Was oar situation pow less cri
tical than heretofore, our commerce and our
frights less threatened, or had we less need of
the confidence and good will of other na
tions ? Was it of less importance to us now
that the iuftice of our cause (hould bÂ« well
ttuderflood, the prwreiplca of our conduct
clearly explained, the foundation of our
elaims fully laid open, than when these mi
nisters were appointed. When we were on
the eve, perhaps of a druggie for our na
tional independence, was it a time to cast .
censures on the executive, to weaken its
hands, and to sow diffention in the govern
ment ? When the time, perhaps, was on the
point of arriving, when we must reCft en
croachments or yield up our rights, was
that a moment to diminilh our chance of
having those rights well understood, and ge
nerally acknowledged ? He believed not.
If there were gentlemen who wish to dis
grace this government, to deliver up this
country, bound hand and foot, to forcjon
t-Â£~j, â Â» in. -wcronvw
power, confefs that we have been wrong,
and tread back our steps, if there were
such gentlemen, it would be perfeftly consist
ent in them to vote for a measure the natural
effeft of which was to weaken-the govern
ment, divide the country, and impair our
Handing among foreign nations in a moment
of crisis: but if there were no person? of
thisdefcription, which he'fondly hoped ; if,
as he firmly believed, a large majority of that
house was determined to exert the whole force
of tbs country in defence of its rights sooner
than yield them up ; they, he trutted, would
agree with him in opinion, that we ought
now, above all other times, to (land strong
in the good opinion of foreign powers, that >
cur foreign intercourse was more important
to us now than ever heretofore, and that
found policy forbid its diminution.
And yet, Mr. Harder said, this is the mo
ment, it is in this critical situation of our
affairs, that the patriotism ol gentlemen calls
on them torefufe the appropriations hereto
fore granted for the support of our ministers
abroad ! This is the moment in which ihey
chufe to fay to the world, " the Executive
cannot be trulled ; he has employed ufefefs
ministers, has expended the public money
improperly, and we, no longer able to con
fide in him, will withholu that proviliofi
which the house has repeatedly faudlionecl,
and which it renewed and enlarged no longer
ago than June last f" Whence this changed
conduct! How has the Executive become
less worthy confidence than it was in Jene ?
Is it because he has adopted aeosrfe of mea
fuies less tame and supple towards a foreign
nation, than gentlemen desired ? If this were
the motive, he believed it would neither be
avowed by gentlemen themselves nor borne
by the country; and yet what other could
be afligned ?
Mr. Harper then took notice of the re
marks which had fallen from Mr, Gal.'atin
yesterday, with refpeft. to the' manner in
which the different appropriations for fyreigp
;ntercourfe had been made, and supported his
former statement by a particular referÂ«nce to
the accounts, and the proceedings of the
house.
Mr. Harper said, he would now advert to
another position advanced by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin) and found
ed on a total misrepresentation of what he,
Mr. Harper, had stated when he was firft
upon'this quell ion.,- He: should hardiy have
thought it conceivable that the gentleman 1
from Pennsylvania, after a fentimcnt had j
been uttered in debate by a perfan whom he
wished to oppose, (hould immediately rift
and wholly misrepresent it to suit his own 1
purpafe ; had he not seen so many instances 1
of the boldness wherewith that gentleman re- 1
lied on the inattention or the credulity of 1
the house. That gentleman, on the present <
CKfcafion, had reprefsnted him as having at- 1
tributed theoppofition to executive measures i
in that house, to the anger which gentle- 1
men felt at the disappointment of their hopes !
of obtaining offices : and he had thea gone f
on to infer that the hope of obtaining 033- 1
ces must also influence the conduit of those 1
members who usually supported the raea- t
fures of the Executive; since, if difap- 1
pointment in the pursuit of office could pro- '
dues opposition, it was equally fair to attri- I
bute a contrary conduft in other members to i
the hope of fucceading in this pursuit. But 1
Mr. Harper affirmed that he had said no 1
1 such thing ; that he had never attributed the I
oppofirien to this motive. â  He had indeed
d said, that the suspicions of gentlemen, and
r their, clamours about Executive influence,
J patronage and corruption, proceeded from
s diffjipoinrment, bur not from difoppotnt
- meat of this kind. Ambitious ftatefracn,
1 Jk- fitid, diil not wish for office, but power,
f they did ne>t wish to hold post* thetnfeives,
: but to <jirc4V.tb i~: who did hold them ; to
1 fee their own fyitem adopted, their own ad
fice followed, and the affairs of the country
cpnduded in the way which they
This was their ajm, and this the leupe and
I end of all their exertions. While men
should continue to think differently on mat
ters of opinion, there would always be a
number of perfous who would disapprove
the manner in which public affairs, or any
other affairs, were condoled. Thel'e per
sons, in governments like our'*, would gra
dually form themselves into a party, and
their opinions would 2ffume the Oiape of a
political fyftein, diffeient from that attyally
adopted. These jtwo systems would be in a
perpetual state of ccnflid, and the fuppor'ers
of thai which might hapf*" ll to he vanquish
ed, would feel mortification and chagrin.
These feelings would become more and more
violent in pre.jurtion as their cefeats were
more frequent, and on quetiions t> which
they annexed greater importance : and hence
â proceeded and always would proceed, those
heart-burnings and jealousies, those little
suspicions, which gave themselves vent in
declamations against rhe pppofite fyflem and
its fupporrers, against Executive injÃuence,
against patronage and corruption, and where
by the party which could not rule waa
prompted to fufpeit and arraign the motives
which a&uated the authors of their defeat.
Such were the pa (lions and such the feelings
to which h# attributed the opposition ofgen
tlemen and their little unfounded suspicions:
to a love of power, not to a love of place ;
to disappointment in their attempts to bring
their own fyflem and their own principles
into aftion, not to the purfyic of office. In
some countries indeed, office confered power,
and was therefore fought by ambitious men
as a means of obtaining power. Office
there gave patronage, authority asd in.
fluence, and was therefore eagerly pej
fued. But in this country, he said, the cafe
was different. Offices here gave a fcÂ»nty
maintenance, much labour and no patronage
. jjrjnflaence : and therefore ambitious poli
ticians aUI Tfo
the' place for such men to appear. There,
and there alone they had a conspicuous the
atre for the display of their talents; there,
and there alone could they acquire fame, po
pularity, and political importance; there,
and there alone could they make a strong
impression on the country and the govern
ment, give weight to their own opinions, and
force their own system into aftivity. There
of course tiiey would desire to remain and not
to undertake offices, which, though refpefta
ble, were not brilliant, imposed much labour
but conferred neither splendour nor autho
rity.
It was not, therefore, to the disappoint
ment of gentlemen in the pursuit of those ob
jects, Mr. Harper said, that he attributed
-their conduft, but to the usual operations of
party f;>itit; a fpixit which arose out of
the conliitution of our nature, combined with
the form of eur government; and of which
he did not complain. He not only knew
that it mull exist while men should be made
as they are, but he believed that it ought to
exist. "ft hile eppofite parties in the go\ em
inent struggled fer pre-eminenie, they were
like persons engaged in an exhibition before
the public, wha ate obliged to display ftipe
rior merit and fujer;or excellence in order to
gain the prize. The public is the judge, the
two parties are the combatants, and that par
ty which possesses power must employ it pro
perly, must conduit the government wifely,
in order to ensure public approbation, and
retain their power. In this contention, while
the two patties draw different ways, a middle
course i. produced generally conformable to
public good. Party fp-rit, therefore, and
the contentions to which it gave rife, neither
alarmed nor diTpfeafed him. It might, in
deed, some timet run into excels, and produce
mifchief, as the witid may foffletimey be
conve.-rid tnto a storm, or fire give rife to a
conflagration; but its effefts, like
those of the great elements of nature, he had
no doubt, were beneficial.
There was another topic, Mr. Harper
said, which though, in his mind, whally un
connected with the fubjeft, had been intro
duced into the debate, and much insisted on,
and therefore he did not think it ought pass
without remark. It had been said, he knew
not on what authority, that a resolution had
been formed by the executive to employ, in
official llatior.s, none but those who were
known to approve the political system adopt
ed by the aaminiilration ; and.thishad been re
presented 3sa most alarming and a most repre
hensible determination. For his part, Mr.
Harper said, he knew nothing of the deter
mination made by the Executive on jliig
head ; b'jt he had no hesitation in faying,
that he hoped, and wished to fee this resolu
tion adopted and adhered to. He wished it
even mote than he hoped it j for there had
rot been, in his opinion, fufficiently strong
indications of such a refofution in the con
duftof the Executive hcretofote. He'once
thought that a contrary conduft might be
fafely, and even beneficially purfutd: boc
recent and very strong experience had con
vinced him ot his mitfake. He hoped this
experience had produced the fame effeft cn

it which gentlemen cxpreCed Such alarm, a
mount to? Simply to thisâthat the Execu
tive, in conducting ihpfe concerns of the
government wherewith it ijexelofivel* char
ged, and for the management of which it is
folÂ«Jy refponfiole, should employ furli peiSoni
as subordinate agents, as were known to ajret
v. ith him in opinion aljpnt the right mode
of conducting them. Wai this any thing so
extraordinary ? Was it not praftifed by eve
ry man of common undei (larding in the ma
nagement of his own private affairs ?âLet
mr aik the gentleman, from Virginia, (Mr.

would lx take one who differed wholly from
kjin in his opinion'! Abo â¢ .or^culuireand the

perion whose ideas on these Subjects he be
lieved to be correal, and kflew to agree with
those principles about the truth of which he
himfelf had no doubt ? Would he not be
the more cautious in this refpeft, in propor
tion as the farm to be managed wÂ»s more dis
tant from his own residence, and of course
the conduct of the agÂ»nt less fuhje& to his
fuperintendance and crmtroul ? If he did not
act thus, he would depart moll widely from
his tifijr.l prudence, and might think himfelf
fortunate if he fullained no greater loss than
that cf his crop.
And (hall the President of the United
States, in conducting the affairs of this
Union, nrgleft those pliin and ordinary
maxims o( prudence, which every man ob
feryef in his private affairs ? The executive
is charged witji foreign relations of rf\e coun
try, and with the whole execution ot all its
laws. The greatest differences of opinion
that exiTt arpong us, arise from these rela
tions. The executive has adopted a certain
fyflera as to the manner in which they ought
to be condufted. This system is disliked and
opposed by one Set of .men, while another
.description approves and Supports it. The
whole question is, whether tne subordinate
agents who are to execute this system under
the orders of the President,(hall "be ebofen from
among those who like it, or those who think
it radically wrong, have never omitted
any opportunity of attempting to change it ?
To choose from the latter would be to fay,
that those persons who are most opposed to
a mealure are, for that reason, the bed quali
fied to give it effeft.
A gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Harper
said, has talked much of the executive hav
*ing a party, a party in legation : and has
asked what theu becomes of our government
of departments, and whether the executive
could refufe to execute a law becanfe he did
it a good onj? TÂ»' y 1
gentleman who fpokeofapar
-Ity in legislation, or doubted about the ob
ligation of the executive to execute a law
whether approved by it or not. Does not
that gtntlcmen know that there are execu
tive functions distinct from legislative functi
ons, and that the Preiident is charged with
the former, as well as the legislature with
the letter ? It is not perhaps, surprising,
considering the degree of animation, not to
fay pafiion, to which the gentleman had
worked himfelf up, that he should overlook
a difttnClion so obvious as that between le
gislative and executive functions ; but will
Jie not now acknowledge that the President
being solely charged with one, is solely ref
poÃfible for it to the house, the country a;id
his conscience, while the legislature is solely
rtfponfible for the other. And, in conduct
ing those affairs, for which he is solely res
ponsible, must not the President have a sys
tem ? Or would the gentleman from Geor
gia wish the executive department to be con
ducted without system ? If he must have a
system from whence is he to derive it ; from
his own judgment or from the dire&ion of
others? Surely from the former source.
Will not differences of opinion exill respeCt
ing this system, whichÂ»fome will approve,
while it is conSidered as most improper by
others ? No doubt this will be the cafe.â
From which class then, must the President
take his agents, in the execution of this sys
tem, those confidential agents with whom he
is to advise, by whose eyes he must often fee,
with whole hands he must often work, and
to whose fidelity and discretion he must of
ten trust in remote Situations, beyond his
immediate fuperintendance and conlroul i
Shall he take them from the approvers or
oppoferi of the system ? When he has a thing
to be done shall he employ those to do it
who think it riglii and beneficial, or those
who think it wrong and mifc' ievous ? Shall
he expose himfelf to the danger of having
his orders disobeyed or ncgleCted by an a
gent, who though charged with their exe
cution, may choose to set up his own wiS
doin above that of his employers, and to
dispense with that which they have consider
ed as iodifpenfable ? Shall he expose himfelf
to the danger of having his plans, however
necessary.in his own judgment, counteracted
by an ignorant or presumptuous agent, who
thinks them hurtful, and chooses to aCt ac
cording to his own opinions indeed of his
iuftruCtions ? Should he thus act and thus
expose himfelf and the great interests wherÂ«-
with he is charged, he would cease to de
serve either the tefpeft of individuals, or the
confidence of the country.
But it may be allcdged, continued Mr.
Harper, that the integrity of an ageut will
be a Sufficient security for his'afting accor
ding to his instruCtions, though contrary to
his own private opinions. It may fomttimes
be so, but the risk is great, and recent ex
perience does not authorise the experiment.
Even were -it otherwise, still when you ear
ploy a person tp execute meafure6 which be
does not approve, you take away one of the
btft and ftrongtft securities for his due per
formance : you deprive yourfelf of his zeal
of his heart, of his enthusiasm which arc
not only the furefl guards of fidelity, but
the most powerful means of success..
If the executive therefore, has a system
in the conduft of those affaiis wherewith it
!Â» :bÂ«rgfd, and to fay fhat it has not, is to
charge it with ibi.y, Â»{ must cither be dis
honest, or conceive that fyrtcm to be pro
per : i:id conceiving it to be proper it is us
duty to use the moil eife*tu3l means for car
ryitig it into effect, One of the most eft- |
cAcious of these means ij, to make use ot
men, who otherwise qualified, believe the
system to be right. Such men consequent
ly, and such alone, ought to be employed:
and hence it follows, that for the executive
to negleft that, the determination to do
which gentlemen charge agaiait it as an im
propriety, and even a crime, would be at
btft an aÂ£t of folly, if not the breach of a
sacred obligation.
Mr. Harper then proceeded to remark
on what had been advanced yesterday by
the gentleman from Pennfylvacia (Mr. Gal
latin) rel'peCting the minister at Lisbon.
That gentleman, said he, has charged,lÂ»y
former colleague with having voted for an
appropriation for a new office, in order to
make room for his own appointment to a
vacancy thus ereated. He saysÂ» that my
late colleague, when the eiiniffyx at Lisbon
was to be Sent to Berlin, came Ato the house
not indeed with a commilfioi in his pocket,
but certainly <with a knenilt&c that he him
felf was to fill the vacant place at Lisbon,
and voted for the Berlin ippropriation, Did
the gentleman advert tÂ» the extent of this
charge ? I am wiljin? to hope that, he did
not; for then he wand not have advanced
it, especially in so nofitive a manner, with
out some fort of proof. No such proof
could have been prodi/ced. I take upon
myfelf to declare that none such exists. By
recurring to the journals of the senate, it
will appear, that the nomination of a min
ister to Lisbon was made on the 6th of Ju
ly. I have authority for faying, that the
firft intimation which my late colleague re
ceived of his intended nomination, was the
day before the nomination took place; that
is on the sth, two days after that appropri
ation was made, for which he is charged
with having voted in order to make room
for himfelf. When he gave this vote, he
might have expeCted the appointment j
but he had 110 more right to expeCt it than
any other man. He did not know that he
would be appointed, nor was he applied to
on the subjeCt till after tfie Berlin appro
priation had been voted. It would have
been highly improper to apply to him be
fore, and it is very improbable, in itfelf,
that the application was made until after
the appropriation for Berlin, for although
the President had resolved to fend the mini
nifter from Lisbon to Berlin, he could not
execute this intention without a vote of
j money, and to apply to a gentleman to ac
cept the vacancy before that vote took place
[ and, of course, before it was certain that
There Vx/uM-ir. â tioata
have been very strange condnft. ..
This much I have thought it necessary to
slate, said Mr. Harper, and I will add one
observation addressed to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania. It is this, that he ought to
take warning from this occasion not to make
it neeefiary in Suture to deSend perSons in
their abfcnce against attacks, which being
wholly unfounded, candour no leSs than-de
licacy and generous fentimeuts, oujjht to
have prevented.
As to the general policy of the Jirefent
motion as eonneCted with the foreigH relati
ons of this country, Mr. Harper said, that
he wcild add two or three remarks on that
fubjeft, and then conclude.
The motion went, he said, to reduce the
appointments and falaiies of three ministers:
those to Madrid, Lisbon, and Berlin ; and in
Support of the motion, it was alledged that
thelaftof these ministers was entirely unne
ceflary, 3nd that the other two had been im
properly, because unnecessarily, raised from
mit.iftera refidentto mitiifters plenipotentiary.
To him it was a fufficient answer to these
allegations ta fay, that the President had
thought otherwise: because the President
being charged by the constitution with the
foreign relations of the country, must be in
verted with the means necessary Sor conduct
ing them with effeft ; and was infinitely bet
ter qualified by his Situation, to judge what
those means were, and how they ought to
be used, than the house could pretend to be.
One of these means was the appointment of
foreign ministers, which was expressly veiled
in the President by conftitution. When
the President, therefore, had thoijght fit to
appoint foreign ministers, Or to alter their
grades, he had exercised a constitutional
power, and it did not lie with the boiife of
rcprefentativts to objeCt or judge. To him,
therefore, Mr. Harper laid, it was a fuffici
ent answer to all tkofe objeftions, to Say,
that the President had thought otherwise.
To others, who might hold different opini
ons Srpm him on this SubjeCt, he thought it
was a Sufficient answer to be told that the
house of representatives, as well as the Pre
sident had thought differently, and had sanc
tioned the changes which hp had thsught
proper to make in this rffpefi, by voting
money to carry them into effect. This the
had done expressly in all the three cases
aontemplated by the present motion. The
ministers to Madrid and Lisbon had been
raised from residents to plenipotentiaries in
May 1796, at which time, and also in
March 1797, the house had voted an addi
tional Sum made necessary by theSe changes
arid had hereby Sanctioned the changesthem-
Selves. The embassy to Berlin was resolved
on ja June 1797, and the houSe then sanc
tioned the measure by giving the requisite
appropriation. Surely it might have been
expected that the strongest advocates for le
gislative contrÂ»ul and legislative sanCtion,
would be Satisfied by this repeated approba- |
tion cf the house: but no, gentlemen were j
not to be fa falisfied. They still contended
that it was proper to enquire into the use !
and the reason of thefs changes, and de- '
manded why they had been made, what cir-'
cumilances rendered them neceflary, and
what good they had produced? Though '
be protested againll the right of the house to
make these enquiries, mere especially at
this time, after the mcafures had been so for
mally and so repeatedly fauftioiud, he r.pv
crtheleffi had 110 obje&ion to inform gentle- j
n;t! what in his opinion had beta the occa- |
fion, and the benefits of two of these ap- \
point ments, those. to- Madrid, and Lilbon. 1
As to the embafly to Berlin, the reasons and
advantages of it had beeci so fully explained
in the fnmmer session, that nothing seemed
neeeffary to be added to tfie remarks made
by fame other gentlemen on that ftibjeft in
the course of the present debate.
It cauid 1:0?, he laid be forgotten by gintle-,
men tkaÂ«4n iht begianing of 1796, or a little
pnviaiiato that (teiigd, we fettled very mueh
to our otvu fÂ»tiÂ»faefi#n, a long (finding and
dilagreeable with the government of
- Spain. The treaty whereby this fcitlemcnt was
placed the two nations o.i a f'oo-ing of
aniity, and facir#d to (is objeits of very great
extertfi?e iVd intereiliHg part
of the tfnjon. The final attainment, hewtver,
of these objefts and the due exÂ«cu;ioa of the
r. clry, fcuif? very mueh on thi Cootinu
ance of a good between the two
governrrieiTTj. Spain, after-keeping only com
j miffioners, and charges dei affaires liere for a
I coofider4ble time,bad lent us a minister plenipo
tentiary, and iii the intercourse between govern
ments it was usual and an expefled civility
to return a minister of the fame grade that was
received. This compliment Spain expefted,
and however ihconfiderable theft matters may
appear to us, we know that great importance
is annexed 10 them by courts We must deal
with people 29 we find them, and where we have
ah mtereft to cultivate theijr good wilf, weMmufi
conform to their prejudices andtafhions, instead
of ridiculing ar disregarding them. As Spain
had made an advance by fending us a minister
plenipotentiary, and expeffced a return of the
compliment, would it have been wife for the
paltry Sum of 4,500 dollars, the difference be
tween the two appointments, rodifippoint and
disgust.a power which we had so great an in
terefl to conciliate ? He bÂ»Uved not: the Presi
dent had thought not ; the house on two 01-
three formeroccafi .ns had thought not ; and he
hoped that tihe fame opinion would now influ
ence its dechion.
As to Portugal, the reasons in favor of the
the change Sad been equajly llrgng. We had firtl
a minister resident at that court; it had sent us a
mmiflef of* thr fame grade who was after wards
changed into a minlftcf plenipotentiary, and had
been received by o.ur government. Portugal not
only bad a rithi to expefi, according to the cere
monial efiibliflied among nations, that we should
fend her a Binifler of the fame grade, but (he. did
expeA it, Â»jd even made a request to that effect.
Had wÂ« tocultivate with Portugal,that we
ought to havt disappointed her in this refpeft, and
run the rifl! of difÂ»uÃing this friendly power ?
Our direct commerce indeed was not very great
with her, kut a very important and interfiling
branch of oui trade, was likely "to be deeply as.
feded by her measures. She was the power which
yras ufualljr X war with the Al<erineÂ«, and had
frequently kipt them blocked up in the Streights;
whereby allSur commerce to that quarter of the
world, âa the security of which we
had facrificed nearly one million and an half of
dollars, was rendered fafe from their depredations.
Was it a fmtll objedl then, to be on good terms
with a powei which held so effedtual a check over
rhyf-- .K
ltandirtg to beendangered by withholding an accul
tomed mark oi respect, which she expeiSed, and
of which she lad fetthe example ? And for what
objeÂ£ do gentfemcc contend, that this risk ought

Upon the whole", Tie said, eonfidering thelength
of time this efablifhment had continued ; the fc
lemnity with vhich it had been so repeatedly sanc
tioned by Congress-âthe critical nature of our pre
sent situationâthe importance of preserving all our

Executive, in theptefent crisis, which was the i.-
reft tendency, anj even the avowed objeA of the
prefentmotionhe rould not for a moment sup
pose that it woo Id be adopted by the house.
Mr. Livingston said, had he not seconded
the motion of the gentleman from Virginia, he
kÂ«ew not that he fhouldhavc troubled the com
mittee with his sentiments on this occafioa. He
thought the reafsns whieh had been adduced by
the gCDtleman from Virginia, for the adoption
of his motion, were He had dated,
that in all governments, where the executive and
legiftative powers were placed in different bo
dies, there was a confiant tendency to an in
crease â¢fexeoutivepitronage, by means of the
power to appoint to office. He did not expedt
that so plain a pofitiou would have been at
tempted to be controverted. Not that the gen
tleman wilhed to get rid of this patronage, or
.that the-power fhculd be placed any where clfe,
but merely to prevent its increasing, and becom
ing mischievous. He ffated, from proof which
had produced cotiviflien on his own mind, that
there was a determination in the executive of
this couufry to increase that patronage, by con
fining its appointment to office to men of a cer
tain political opinion. He was sorry to hear
his friend,ipake thiÂ» declaration, because, how
eTer wcfTne might himlelf have been convinc
ed ofthe fai3, he was apprehensive the fame
coaviflion could not be produced on the mind*'
of other gentlemenâhe coofefied it did not pro
duce conviflion on his mind. But what had
been heard from gertlemap in ippofition to this
motion ? The tlailrilie had been avowed. The
people of the United States had lived to hear,
that it was right in the executive to ptomole
none to office, but of its cwn party. Or, if not
party, clothe the th!iig in what words gentle
men pleafcd, it came \p the fame meauing.â
This was at gcc? declaring, that the executive
of the United States lud a parly, and that there
was a party iu opposition to the executive, who
were not deferv.ng of the favour of governmeat.
Mr. L. wilhed to examine this dodrineâ 1u
VVas it contended that ii was becoming in gov
ernment to detnm.ne thit men of a particular
opinion only Ihonld receive the rewards which
11 had to bestow ? For he denied that tbel'e offi
ces were matters of paltry confideratiou. With â 
refyeifl {o salary, he acknowledged the object
was not great; but inasmuch as these offices
were proofs of public confidence, they, were
high rewards. If this doctrine were to be ad
mitted, belo e the president could appoint any
person to office, he must hold an inquisition up
on his political opinion, and require proofs of
his having always ailed in a certain way. If
this -vere 10 lie done, the preudent of the United
States would fii&Aoin the exalted (ittfjiion of
the hew! of it freepeoplc, to the miserable lead-
I er of a party.
This was one effcifi; hut there were others
It vas supposed, in hit leiciTtioii-for office, the
f prtfident would leek fqr virtue and talents. But,
iirthe dodtrinf of were to prevail, if
men of this defcriptibn were not to be found rf
a certain opinion, men must be chof. n devoid
of talents and of virtue.
I Mr. L. would not believe, therefore,
lhntjiojr gentlemen had avowed it to be the
rase, that the executive had come to arty such
determination. He believed that
men thm.ght it would bs right for him to ds so ;
-â hiirksf iotjM sat btlieve tlfat fiient of
thcTJ.i.ifi States joined them in opinion. Nay,
lie had h.s awn declaration that hr did not ;
lor, in tiie ai'drefs which hi delivered on h * in
ab^njTMtion, which mÂ»ght bÂ® considered as his
pM'niia' creed, he expressly declared, that in
rppntrtrnerts to office he would feck for virtu
ous men of all parties. not ? Wat
.virtu? confined to men of a certain politic:'.! or
religious opinion? He trusted not : anj what
ever might be the private opinion of any perfoa
appointed to office, if he countera&ed the in
ftru&ions which wre i*iven to hiin, he stepped
beyond tiie limits of his d lty ; he outstepped the
lawsâand thank God (exclaimed he) we have
laws, that will punilh offences, whether they a
rise from ambition, corruption, or any other
source.
But, as he had"alteady la d, he did not believe
this, for another, and a vr v serious consequence
might arise from it. Let us imagine it possible,
fÂ»Â«d-he-, { and pray G>d the imagination may
never he realized!) that, at some fyt'ire time,
the United. Starts Ihoold have a prefkhent, who
had a prcdile&ion far a particular form of gov
ernment ; who might think th t the standard
which he has formed in his own mind wai the
standard of perfeitien, and who would, there
fore, cause all his tr.cafures fo-bend that way ;
suppose, for inftince, he lhould think that no
form of government was so fit for this country
at a monarchical oneâthat nothing fho'rt of he
reditary diftinitioas could give security and (la
bility to government. If this were his opinion,
he would, of courle, confine his appointments
to persons who lubfcribed to his sentiment. The
confluence of which wou'd be, the government
would he undermined, before the people were
aware of the design. If such ever lhould be the
situation of this coantfy, he trusted, however,
there # ould be republican virtue fufficient to
fruftrate and overturn the design ; but it could
not be done without a cdnvulfion, and this
country knew fufficiently well the miseries at
tending such an event, to authorize every possi
ble caution which could be taken to prevent so
great a calamity. I
But gentlemen had spoken of the executive
being warned, by awful experience, from ap
pointing perl"on3 to office of a certain opinion.
The meaning of this iniinuation could not be
mistaken. Every one knew who was meant as
well as if the gentleman had been named.â
Yet those who made the allusion were io sensibly
alive to every refleflion on oharafker, that the
house had been eruertaiafd for half w iwur m
the defence of a chara&er which had never been
attaclce l; as when his friend from Pennsylva
nia mentioned the gentleman lately appointed
to Portugal, it was only to (hew the possible ef
fedl to be produced by executive patronage, for
he immediately exonerated that gentleman frora
aÂ£ling from improper motives. Mr. L.acknÂ® *â -
ledged that the leflbii which gentlemen alluded
to, was an awful and important one, and ought
to be taken as an exemplification for the raifchie
vous doflrine now sontendad for. For, said
he, whence has arisen our present diipute with
a certain foreign nation, but from an adherence
to the principles which gentlemen recommend
ed ? Whilst that gentleman was in office, our
affairs in that country bore a very different af
pe<Â£l from what they bore after he was-recalled.
Let gentlemen-think of this, and consider whe
ther iÂ» not afford an awful lejfon for the fu
ture governmeat of the executive. Hethought
it did, and he hoped it was a lsfTon which would
have its due effeil upon the United States.
But, to torn to the amendment. It was ob

was ufeful. Gentlemen were called upon to
(hew what good had been produced by the
change which took place eighteen months ago.
This they declined, and called upon the advo
cates of this amendment to (hew what gooi
would be produced, if it were to take effeil. He
believed it "would produce much good. In the
firft place it would leflen executive influence ;
though he did net wish wholly to destroy this
influenceâfor he had foine refpetft to his oath,
and he had some degree of admiration yet re
maining for that instrument called the conltitu
tion, and some remembrance left of the efforts
which he used to get it adopted ; but, though
he would not annihilate that patronage, he
would not increase it. Did necessity require
that we fhauld have all the ministers plenipoten
tiary we now have, and those we soon shall have,
if these are continued? Gentlemen
committee they did not kaow the reasons which
influenced the executive ; tiat therefore this bu
fineis must be left to that department, and that
all the legislature had to do, was to appropriate
for all the ministers it might chufe to appoint.
This qus'tion had, however, been contrarily de
termined at a former session, after a discussion
which could leave no doubt upon the mind of
any one. Mr. L. said he would mention anoth
er evil, which he trusted would make some im
pression upon the house, that was the expenee
of the ministers in quefiion, which, as he believ
ed it was unnecefiary, ought to be avoided ;
for, though the" gentleman lift up had said fime
thing about the ad/antiges to be derived from
Portugal, he never heard of any to be derived
from Prullia. Indeed, experience that
though yc liad-gonc- onincrgjfioy rnr diplo
matic agents, no good tiling had ever been pro
duced by them, except theSpar.ilh treaty., whieh
was Of ical advantage to the country ; some o
ther tliiugs had been done by them, which, he
believed, had beef! far better undone. Indeed
the gerttlemin from S. Carolina ( Mr. Pinck
ney) than whom 110 one cotljd he better able to
give an opinion upon the fubjeel, declared that,
iu his opinion, our diplomatic connexions had
been injurious to this country, and that they
ought to be got rid of as form as convenient ;
though, he added, he did not think this a prop
er time, or that this was the bed mode of dming
the bufnefs. He thought this declaration ought
to have a great weight.
Mr. Dana said, he found, that if this a
mendmeut took] place, it would prcducea sav
ing of 4,500 dollars a yeai to three ministers
which would be 13,500 dollars a year in the
whole. "Yet the gentleman lull up even
considered this favir.g, as worthy of the
debate which had taken place. In a pe
cuniary point of view, he supposed the de
bate itfclf would cost more money. But with
refpedl to economy, this was vulgar lop
ping, arid a miferabte attempt at public economy.
Public economy was not to be thus attained,
but by introducing order and lyileca into
our affairs ; and by etnployiogjtalerits In our
public offices. But it was said, our liber
ties were in danger, from an extension of
Executive patronage. This he allowed,
was au admirable tbeme for popular decla
mation, and perhaps might produce the ef
feft which the trover and supporters of the
bnfinefs wished. The gentleman from Vir
ginia spoke of the liberties of the people as
depending upon the minorities in Congrtfs
and that the preftrvation of the constitution
was owing to them, at lealt he so under
ftoodthe gentleman; he would correft him
if he was wrong. [Mr. Nicholas rc-ftatcd
wliat he had said.] Mr. D. continued, tho'
the gentleman had nut said expnlsly so, he
seemed to wiih this to be the ucderftanding
of what be said ; and he considered this as a
key to the whole debate. This motion,this
debate were intended to attraft public at
tention. If the gentleman thought this was
the way to preserve the liberties of the peo
ple;, he was certainly right in adopting this
mode, but he was furry that, for this pur
poGe, the committee should be reduced to
mere puppets, Cnce the speeches which were
made on this occalion were addrcflcd more
to the stenographers and the galleries, than
to the chair or to the members present.
Admitting that this was the view in which
the bufmeis was brought forward, he doub
ted not it would be fully answered.
But what did, the arguments of gentlemen
ifrith reTpeft"toTÂ£xc<-uf| Vr prove?
Everything and nothing. . Could an offi
cer be made without enereafmg Executive
patronage? It certainly could not; and
therefore to prevent this patronage every
office under the government ought fp be an
nihilated. But the conflitution had declar
ed the Executive was to appoint to office.
The framers of it knew it would givÂ» the
Executive some power; but they gave it
notwithstanding. He might Upon the fame
ground object to the superior talents of the
mover of this amendment, which gave him
so great an influence in this house, as being
incompatable with the equality.upon whi<fh
the numbers of that body flood, and pro
j pole some process by which they might be
s reduced to the common standard. He did
net think the argument applied fpecifically
- to any thing.
J The next argument was the danger to-be
apprehended from a concurrence in opinion
betwixt the different branches of the govern
ment, as the different departments were in
tended to bfe a check upon each other. For
his own part, lie apprehended no, danger
from this source. It was not probable
that they would agree in measures that were
wrong ; br.t that titty wopM Â» r r~ thofc
which were right. But, according to the
doctrines of some gentlemen, the gov#rn
ment was made up of hottilityapd mutual
rivalry between its different branches j and
that when the two houses and the Prelidtat
concurred in any measure, mifchief was to
[ be theconfequence. His idea ofgovern
t ment, on the contrary, was, that when t jj e
. different branches concurred,thething which
I they (lid was right ; and that when they
1 did not concur, that something was wrong.
: He did not believe there was any danger to
â¢ to be apprehended from the influence of
Executive patronage on the members of the
. legislature. Indeed, considering the obloquy
which patriotism tho't it necessary to cast
upon public officers, he did nat think their
t situations were enviable. How many can
-1 didates for ministers plenipotentiary could
the gentleman from Virginia point to in that
house? If he knew one, it was more than
I he did.âAnother argument was that dip
lomatic agents were not necessary for ccra
â - merclal yvrpCTtty-zrri' rrtre
; .uifikjent for tnis business. ComttierÂ«jol
: concerns between individuals could, douoi
lefs be so fettled ; but when questions caftie
I into view of a national kind, ministers wsre
: necessary to fettle them. He had not the
s hardihood to fay none such would take place.
; But as anargumentagainft the amendment
s The persons now in office were sent to Eu
â¢ rope under an idea of remaining there for
some time, and had arranged their affairs ac
, cordingly. As it refpefted the present
i gentlemen in office, the measure would,
5 therefore, be unjust ; for it could not be
: supposed that they would continue to hold
â¢ offices, when their salaries were redu
' ced one half. BeCdes etiquette required
J that we should have the fame grade of mi
. nifters aboard, that foreign courts aid here.
Mr. D. concluded by observing that Jie
â¢ forbore to follow gentlemen into observations
â¢ wholly unconnefted with the que (lion before
' them. The present state of Europe, he said,
J forbade the proposed reduction of our mi
nisters, as there probably never was a time
. when trifling causes produced greaterevents,
â  or when the talents of miaifters abroad might
â¢ be more ufeful to this country.

VENICE, Oftober 16.
On the 12th inft. a conspiracy was dis
covered here, which, as our patriots fay,
had for its objeft, to cut down the tree of
liberty, abolish the new democratic consti
tution of government, and fubjeft the city
to a foreign monarchical power. Immedi
ately all the Chops and coffee-houfes were
(hut up, and the guards augmented by the
French Potifh legion now here, and patroles
fjnt out. Under the dir'&ions of the
French gtneral Bulland, -ifTiftcd by a sron~
military force, on the night of the 13th,
between 70 and 80 persons were arrested ;
among whom were 10 members of the mu
nicipality, 10 clergymen, several of the
cx-nobles, as for example, Crimani, D.an
dolo, Pefaro, See. In confequeuce of this
conspiracy, the following proclamation has
been publilhed by our municipality :
" LibertyâEquality.âThe Provisional Mu
nicipality of Venice to the People.
" CitizensâA dark intrigue had prepa
red new fetters for you. Base metf accus
tomed to kiss the chains imposed on them
by the oligarcky, -Mxious to restore the an
tient (lavery, fought toTftaÃimi tk< J e f P u.
tifm of a new tyrant. But the ever-watch
ful genius of liberty has dete&ed and de
feated the conspiracy. The traitors are ar
rested. The speedy and firm measures a
dopted by the committee of public welfare
has cru/hed the hydra of counter-revolution.
The brave patriot Bulland hastened wilh
the rapidity of lightning tfo ward off the
threatened danger. Citizens, public tran
quility is now fecurad ; refpeft the laws and
1.-. rTie cenftituted authorities. Our
liberty will fer the future no more be attack
ed with impunity.
" Done in the'fitting of the 1 ith of Oc
tober, at night."
This event has given rife to many fpecu
latfons, and many doubts are entertained
with refpedl to its natuie and views. On
the 13th, the President of the municipality
declared, that among the persons arrested,
enly a few were guilty ; and that the reft
would be detained only as hostages. It is
fuppiofed by some, that the whole has been
concerted to remove some persons who
flood in the way.
PARIS, Oftober 27.
It said that the objeft of the appoint

October 16.
Letters from Tufcany state, that the
French Venetian fleet, which has 15,000
land troops on board, can have no other
obje<st than the Neapolitan government.
This at haft is certain, that the court of
Naples, a3 well 33_tjiat of Rome, are mak
ing warlike preparations, with a degree of
activity and zeal, which cam only be ac
counted for either by adefire to attack, or
by fear of being attacked.
It appears by a letter from Bruflels,. that
the Archbilhop of Mechlin, who has been
transported beyond the Rhine, by order of
the dire&ory, is universally regretted in
Belgium. The cause of his having been ba
niftied was occasioned by his having address
ed a Pastoral letter to the commiflioners of
the executive directory, nearly as follows:
" The Apostolic, Catholic, and Roman
religion, which I most cordially profefs,
and of which I am a principal pastor, and o
bliged to give example to others, positively
forbids an oath of hatred against royalty, $r
the person of a king. Being commanded
to love our neighbour though he injure us,
and royalty being good in itfelf, and of di
vine inftnution, we cannot hate one or the
other without devialing from the principles
of christianity, much less call God as wit
ness to an action prohibited under eternal
{Mrius.
" The impossibility of answering the obli
gations required under the present cireum
ftances, (hould by no means render ojjr fidel
ity fufpefted, for I flatter myfelf, that you
have fufficient authoiity to aflure the repub
lic, that neither me nor my clergy will find
the least difficulty in promising, if necefrary
under oath, never to co-operate, direftly,
in the re eftabli(hment of royalty in France;
and that the government may be perfectly
fatisfied that they (hall never have cause to
punilh the priests, nor find them inimical to
their views, except when the laws and the
constitution is in oppofitiou to the laws* of
God.and the precepts of the gofpa!." '

The following account of the loss of the
Monnikendam Djtch frigate, prize to the
Beaulieu, is given in a letter from Amster
dam, dated Odtober 19.
" The Dutch frigate Monnikendam is
wrecked off Weft Cappel, having their
wounded on board, with the Englilh prize
raafter, a lieutenant, a midshipman and 33
seamen who wereputonboardforthe purpose
of carrying her to England. The frigate
had 14 feet water in her hold : having loft
the temporary masts with which file had been
supplied, and being in the molt imminent
danger of finkinjJ, the prize master fuffered
a Dutch Boatfvvain on board to run her to
wards tbe ftiore. By this means their livas
were saved ; the wounded were conveyed
to an hospital, and the 36 Englilhmen put
011 board tlie Walcheren, which lies at Flush

40 wounded, during the late aition.
The captain of the Hercules Dutch prize
died on Saturday of his wounds, and was
buried on Monday at Yarmouth, with great
funeral pomp, attended by the Dutch and
English officers,'and a company of the Ox-,
ford militia, who fired three vollies over his
grave.

November 8.
A paper of opposition observed yesterday
theft the projeft of the Direftory for the in
vasion of this country was extremely likely
to meet with success, as the numerous ar
mies which had conquered all the continen
tal powers might now be employed against
Great Britain.
On this fubjeft we (hall only remark, that
previous to the termination of the Congress
at Raftadt, which from the variety of mo
mentous objefts to be fettled there, ijiay per
haps rekindle the flames of continental vyar,
& make them rage with encreafed fury, the
Directory cannot withdraw the Republican
armies. It would be highly imprudent to
weaken the army of Italy before the Cisal
pine Republic is completely organized : and
it is from this army that the troops inuft be
drawn which are to form the garrisons of
the Islands which the French have acquired
in the lonian sea, and their new eftablilh
rr.ents in Albania. Their final projects a
gainst fnch states of Italy as they have not
yet subdued, call rather for an augmentati
on of their force in that conntry, than for
a diminution.
As to the army of Germany, it is scarce
strong enough to complete the Diredtory's
plan of invasion against Hanover, Ham
burgh, See. and to garrison the new con
quests of Belgium. Besides, the compara
tive condition of our navy, and that of the
enemy, renders the projected rnvafion a mere
farce. The Directory may succeed in vo
miting a few more of their galley (laves on
some defencelefs part of our coast, but we
have no fear from any formidable preparati
on they may make.

To the MFMBBM of the LF.G-ISLATURk of
PF.NNSTL FA AI A.
To-morrow the order of the day being
for the conlieleration of the bill for making
a turnpike road through Gtpiiautown, Sic.
you will rhen have to decide whether you
will grant relief to a considerable number of
inhabitants, from what they consider a
grievance; and which they fiud increas
ing in the fame proportion as the popnlati- J
on and prosperity of the country tills for
redress.
It is well known that in all new countries
almost every improvement is opposed to the
prejudices of the inhabitants, as well as the
different interests they combine. It is not
my intention to examine all the sources of
opposition that have hitherto fruftrated the
r'-jjcatfd applications to the legislature on
this fubjedt, the mOst material however I
beg leave to investigate.
The firft arose from a diversity of opini6n
ami prejudice among themselves as to the u
tiUrV of the measure.; dire nsceffity has con
viuced a very great majority of the oppon
ents tÃjt their interest and convenience de
mand i\. 3nd they art now (with but a ve
ry few exceptions) united in the present ap
plication.
The next proceeded from the inhabitants
of the neighbouring counties above, who
have invariably contended against it on any
other principle than that of redemption; their
opposition is very considerably diminished qn
being informed that the present application
is founded 011 this idea.
The lall and mofito be lamented is from
a man whose principles are to me totally un-.
accountable and cannot stand the test of in
vestigation, inasmuch as he has never offered
(to my knowledge) one substantial argu
ment against it; but to cairy his point has
been obliged to resort to the fubterfuge of
manoeuvres,of repeated postponements, and
what heispleafedto denominate amendments
bnt with a manifeft view of defeating the ob
je&, insomuch that hie name has become
quite proverbial by the Carters &c. who in
bad roads, when thay get mirei or {tailed
load him with execrations and curies; the
weight of which fins I would not have reft
on me, as the primary cause, of them, for
all the benefits of popularity he enjoys under
them.
Thtfe manoeuvres have hitherto been but
too fucc'efsful. I hope they have been so
hackneyed as to become too flale to be re
peated with success.
A candid investigation of the business is
what is desired from the members generally,
and particularly those who from their distant
residence are no otherwise interested, than
from a desire to promote the good of the
country and the happiness and comfort of
itfl .ir Tf yOU ,<U"C tlMt a
great benefit will arise to the petitioners as
well as to the citizens of Philadelphia, with
out injuring any other class of inhabitants,
you will no doubt afford that relief they
think their situation gives them a ju ft claim
to.
Having {hewn that the opposition In the
two cafas has nearly ceased, I hope it will
not be expefted as to the last. I suppose it '
nearly as prafticable to turn the steeple of
Chrilt's church topsyturvy and stand it on
its spire, as to convince a man that I am sor
ry to fay (for the following realons) I fear
is neither open to the voice of reason, re
fleftion, nor yet the dictates of conscience;
the firft because much has been opposed to
him in vainâthe second, because few per
sons have had a greater opportunity of fee
ing the state of the roadâand last and vvorft
of all, because he has acknowledged himfelf
convinced of the neceffity/oi the measure al
though he has made use of every means in
his power to defeat it. 1 {hall nowleave him
(with my best wiihes for his reformation,
and with full liberty to ride all his life time
through quickfandsand mud;/it ie his choice)
and proceed to fliew that the extension of
the road to so great a diflance as the borough
as Reading at this time will certainly defeat
the objett.
There appears a manifeft impropriety in
carrying a road of this kind through a coun
try/ the inhabitants of which have not ask
ed for but are opposed t6 it. This circum
stance would of course greatly enhance the
price of materials necessary to make it, there
by ewcreafe the toll ; and when compleated,
every artifice would be practiced to evade
the use of a thing, the propriety of which
they are not convinced of.
The impossibility of raising money fuffici
ent to go so great a distance at this time an
the terms contemplated it an insurmountable
difficulty, and at once puts an end to the
business. Although it i| hoped thatenough
may possibly be fubferibed to go to the 12
mile stone. The principle of redemption on
whiclf the opposition has been diminfhed,
will of course fall to the ground or only be a
name by the
tance is short, there is every reason to be
lieve it will be realized.
I cannot but consider it as impolitic torifk
the fate of so desirable an objeÂ£t, by under
taking the whole of it at once. The fmall
nefs of an objeft almost always insures the
success of it, as certainly as the magnitude
of it clogs if it does not entirely fruttrate it,
which I verily believe would be the cafe in
the present instance ; and as I can fee 110
reason why the remainder of the road may
not be done to advantage whenever the in
habitants desire it, "I am induced to hope
that you will agree to strike out the borough,
of Reading and rcndei the objeft attainable
by flopping at the 10, or 12 mile stone.

WHEREAS frauds have been pradlifed, in
obtaining Warrants for Bounty Lands, due
to the Officers and Soldiers of the late Continental
Army, by the production of forged instruments..
To check in future such impositions, it has been
thought advifeable ; that all persons, having claims
for bounty lands, whether in their own right, as
legal rcprefentative.or by virtue of any inftrumeut
or deed of transfer, be required to forward their
refpeitive claims to the War Office, on or before
the firft day of January 1799 in order that such
claims may be duly examined, ad jailed and deter
mined upon.
To fubftantiatf such claims, aflri-X observance of
the rules heretofore iffucd from thÂ» War Office will
be indispensable ; and in addition to what is requit>
ed by the said rules, thi certificate of the acknow
ledgement of a Deed or Power of Attorney, must
also set forth the place #f reGdence and occupation
J of the claimant or person makingfuch acknowledg
ment ; and when the pi oof of personal knowledge
is by a witnefÂ« or witnesses, their place or places of
