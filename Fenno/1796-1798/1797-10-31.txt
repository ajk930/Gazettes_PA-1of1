But, while it may be admitted, that a
competent government has been eftahlifhed -p[
for th- United States, and for this Rate ; t j lÂ£ ]
and while it may be admitted, that this state jendf
is (nffrcierttly subdivided into inferior dif- Q f j t
trifts, it may, yet remain a proper fnbjeft of town
inquiry, whether a competent government ;fmj
has been provided for the inferior diftrifls V ; Â£W
into which this Hate i* subdivided ; and
whether this is not a fubjeft proper for le- ; n a ,
g!(l.>tiv<- consideration : And this fubjeft is com ,
the more open for discussion, as, if any new comr
provision be proper, no extraordinary con- t b e
vocation of the- people, nor any alteration of n \ p
t!it constitution is neCeffiry, to effeft it; but r j t y
it may lie accompli(hed by the ordinary ex- eX pe
ercife ox iegiflative authority. T
It may not however be improper, for a juftii
moment, this enquiry, in order g]y t
ju(| to mention, that there is another division q
of i.he state with a view to elisions. Several cree ,
counties sometimes compose one diftria, for twee
the purpose of choosing one or+nore senators on a
in the assembly or in con- hear
grejs. Ed v
Now, I believe, every county is fubdi- f one
vided into election diftri&s, each composed t j on ,
of one or more township*, or parts of town-
(hips', within the bounds of which, all the p
meet at one place, to c-le&, their j
county, state, or federal officers. new
The powers of government are ufunlly s
divided into three kinds, legislative, judi- t h o |
cial, and executive ; and I consider it as j un ; f
essential, that, not only the whole territo- I J
ry, btyt every divifibn or diftrift, into which witl
it is divided, possess, within ltfelf, full an- 3 (â 
thority of the legislative, judicial, and exe- t h e
cutive kind, under the controul, when any un( j
of its regulations or afts have a more exten- b e
five tendency, of the superior diftricl or be ;
jurifdiftion, which may be affefted by them. t h e
The authority of the government of the 1 n jft
United States, extending over the whole to ,
territory of our is defined rou
in the constitution of the United States. a s,
The authority of the government of Penn- 0 f ,
sylvan 12, one of the diftrifts or members of re g
the United States, extending over, the âf J
whoV of this diftrift, is defined in the con- f uc
ftitution of this state. Ido not take upon t h e
me to futj-geft any improvement in the fede- be
ra! or state government; but proceed to en- All
quire, whether a competent government has f ro
been provided for the counties and town
ships.' into which this state is divided and Q u{
subdivided. . ere
The United States is a corporation. Each a[K
state is a corporation. But it has not* yet p o i
been e-.cprefsly dfclared, that every county, a3
and every township. is also a corporation, bei
This I think essential to be done. ex;
The authority resembling the legislative, ro:
for the county, is vested chiefly in the toi
county commissioners, who are aathorifed Q f
tâ¢Â» impose and apply such sums of money, e rr
a3 ncceffitry for the public service and tJtl
be fit of their refpe&ive counties.* This ou
authority seems to be ample, and I think it n e
- proprr, that the commissioners have com- ft,"
pleat iegTlTatlve authority, to direst the in
ternal taxe3 and improvements of the county. e ir
Besides their present authority, they ought pe
also to have power, to declare any naviga- CQ
ble ft reams, within their counties, to be m i
public highways, and to prefcribc where and m;
how roads (hall be maoe and kept up at the j mi
expence of the county. The manner of their co
cxercifing this authority may be regulated ft;
by laW,'and, like other authorities, in all, U
proper cases, submitted to the eontroul of St
the judic : ary . b)
The commissioners come into office gene- fta
rally unexperienced in their duty, and, not St
seldom, with strong prejudices against a right be
exercise of their authority ; and'before they di.
have overcome their prejudices, or learnt th
their duty, their authority expires. Thus
the office of commissioners is too often filled, gr
not with intelligence and public spirit, but 0 i"
with jo-norance and obstinacy ; and the im- pc
provement and prosperity of the counties are
greatly obftruaed. This might be reme- r it
died, by doubling the time of their appoint- j t ,
ment, and elefting only once in every tÂ«o tic
years ; unless it were thought proper, to pr
double also the number of commissioners, re
and eleft one yearly. ,
The county judiciary ls eftablillied by the ,f
constitution of the state on a refpedable th
footing. The legislature has not yet thought ft
proper, though they have the example of c!
the courts of the United States, for. tn.s tl
purpose, to veil the courts with what is call- ft
ed chancery powers. This is an eftential b ;
improvement yet neceflary, and ealily to bi
be effeaed in the judiciary department. I tl
consider it as another defea in the county h
judiciary, that their records may, before 0
"judgment, bC removÂ«d out of thes o Â« nn y-
All the purjiofes of uniformity might be t i
effeaed, by making the supreme court, as ir
to other counties, while it fit* 111 Philadel- ~
phia, a court for the decision of points ot p
law only, without any jury process,; and by
direaing, that one or more 01 the judges of j,
the supreme court, or with the president of c
the county court, (hould, at stated terms,
and at least once in every year, hold a cir- f
cuitin each county, for the trial of all cases t
removed from the county court into this cir- r
cuit court. Judgments of the county com ts [
it.iVrht be examined in the circuit court on f
writ, of error ; and judgments of the circuit c
court, in the supreme court, which com- t
posed as is now the court of errors and ap
peals, fribuld be the court of la ft rcfort in ,
this state. . '
The executive officers of the jiidiciu. au
thority are iheriffsi coroners, &c.
Â» 1 St. L.
The commissioners have power to appoint This
a clerk. This is an dfficcr eflintiatly ne- th<e ]
ceffary to a proper execution of their trust. parti<
Their proceedings ought t,o be accurately The
recorded, and their books and papers depo- the t
sited in a fafe public office, under tha care of their
their clerk. A
A county tieafurer is also appointed by ed b>
. the commissioners, for the receipt of all the ffiip
county and state money. He also yugbt to pay

The system of township government, as road
' the least important, has been the least at- app<
- tended to ; and it is from the improvement E
" of it, not only as it concerns the fercral be a
townfhips, but as part of the general fyf- have
I tem, that the chief benefit which I haye in font
II view will arise. j
' At present there is no general authority | 1
" in a townftip, analogous to that of county appl
s comtniftioners. The care of the roads is ' 'â¢
" committed to supervisors, and the care of
" the poor to overseers. And for these feve- j {j, ou
ral purposes, they have severally the autho-j 2 .
rity of imposing, applying, colleaihg and lixm
expending the townfliip taxes.

im- ported, in the domestic and unfolemn man- I "
s are n ?r in which the township judicial autho

two tices may issue warrants or other original
, to process, at their own houses, or as occasion
lers, requires, and may there examine any inci- r
dental question ; yet that the justice, and a
' the if there be more than one, the justices, of I c
able the township fliould meet and hold a town-
Jght ft,'p court, for trying and determining f
e of causes in the town-house, and at stated j
this times or court days. Every warrant or

ANECDOTE ei
From the N. Y. Daily Advertiser. bl
" When Franklin was on his million to h
France previous to the alliance, be put up ai
one night at an inn near the frontiers. Gib- rr
bod, the celebrated historian, happening to j,
be in the fame house, Franklin sent his com- a j
pliments, requesting the pleasure of spending
the evening with Dr. Gibbon. In answer tl
1 he received a card, importing, that " not- k
withstanding Dr. Gibbon's regard for the a
t charaÂ£ler of Dr. Franklin, as a man and a p
â  philosopher, he could not reconcile it with j
1 his duty to his king, to have any converfa- tl
tion with a revoltedfubjedt! Franklin in re- tl
' ply wrote a note, declaring, that "though r ,
, Dr. Gibbon's principles had compelled him v
to withhold the pleasure of his conversation, t
' Dr. F. still had such a refpeft for the charac- fc
' ter of Dr. G. as a gentleman and an hifto- e
rian, that when in the course of his writing ]
( the history of the decline and fall of empires, a
: the decline and fall of the British empire r
' {hould come to be his fubjeft, as he expeded \
it fooH would, Dr. F. would be happy to r
furnifh him with ample materials which were t
. in his pofleffion." i
i Upon this I made the following remarks : 1
e " Whether this anecdote record a 1
r truth or not, I (hall not pretend to fay ; 1
but it must be confefled that the expreiT- r
. ions imputed to the two personages were ,
- ftriÂ£tty in charafter. In Gibbon we fee <
c the faithful fubjtft, and the man of candour ;

it confining myfelf, on the present occasion, te )
â¢ the particular instance which he has cited. i
He obje&s to my " reviving animosities ]
I, which all good men desire to bury in oblivion." j
:d How unjust this charge w ipuft be perceived
i at once by evÂ»ry one who casts his eye over
,c the above. The anecdote was not of my
10 feledion ; it was published in n New-York
lt ppper, and republifhed in all those of this
ir city. The publication of it at this time was
St. a fort of dung-hill cock triumph over Great
to Britain, and could be intended for no other
purpofes than that of " reviving animosities."
Id The observations on this fpiteful para
q. graph are such as were naturally called for :
r- the reprobation of the malicious old hypo
:s! crite, who is represented as the hero of the
" anecdote ; and they do not contain the least
refleftion on the American chara3er or.the
of principles of the revolution.
re Old Franklin is held up to the admiration
'y of the people, for having wantonly, and ma
liciously prcdifted that the empire of Brit-
ain foon fall to the ground; and be
sr, cause I call him an oMZanga for this pre
hc diction, I am charged with degrading the
ct * American charader; as if every American
it were admitted to be of the fame disposition,
c h and to entertain the fame vengefulfentiments,
ip as this remorseless old deist. Nay, Mr.
ve Fenno's correspondent carries the thing still
farther, and observes, that the observation
'*â¢ on Franklin neeeflarily applies itfelf to
Mefli's. Waflu'ngton, Adams, Jay, and Ham
tie ilton. But, if this curious logician expe&s
'P : to be believed here, he must firft prove each
c f.~ of these gentlemen to have uttered fenti
nj m,ents equally insulting, vindictive, and fan
cd, guinary, with those of Franklin ; a thing, I
rÂ», believe, which it would be very difficult for
:o " him to do. However, this I have nothing
;he to do with. When I am convinced that
c r_ either of them, not content with obtaining
U- the independence of the Colonies, was fpvage
ito enough to hug himfelf in the hope that the pa

"P him a Zanga. Nor shall Ibe afraid, in so

acs inconsistency. I have thought highly, &ud
' lc I have (poken highly of these gentlemen,
but, did any one ever suppose that I applaud
cd them merely as revSlutionijls ? Much less

PARIS, August 24.
The following curious Letter has been pub
lilhed on the death of the Duke of Or
leans, the Abbe Fauchet, and some Gi
rondines, finned by Lothringer :
" Thaun, in the Department of the
Upper Rhine, July 21, 1797.
" I this moment, Sir,leave aprifon where
I have beefi confined for having retra&edthe
oath of 1791, and for having made such re
caDtation'of it as was fnfficient, according
to the Constitutional Schifma, to have fe
djiced all the world. On my return home
I found a letter from you dated on the 25th
April last, which the fear of doing me an
injury had prevented from being sent to me
in the prisons of Epinal. I hasten to re
ply to it.
" With refpeÂ£t to the Duke of Orleans,
you may inform the Duchess his very ref
pe&able and pious spouse, and who deserv
ed a more happy husband, that I received
a letter from Fouquier Tinville, formerly
the public aceufer of the infamous Revolu
tionary Tribunal, dire&mg me to adminis
ter the last offices of ourreligion to the Duke
of Orleans. Arrived- at the prison of the
Conciergerie, I found him difpoftd to con
fefs .very folly, but a drunken man, whose
name I do not know, and who was condem
ned to fuffer with them, for having, I be
lieve, thrown bread into the common few
er, prevented his doing so by the horrid
blasphemies which in his drunkenness and
his despair he poured forth against religion
and its servants. It was in vain that the
guards attempted toftlence him till at length
by great Providence, the drunken man fell
asleep just as the Executioners had arrived.
" The Duke of Orleans asked me if I was
the German Priest whom the wife of the
keeper of his prison had mentioned to him,
and whether I entertained good religious
principles. I told him that having been fe
dueed by the Bishop of Lydda, I had taken
the oath ; that I had long repented of it, and
that I had nevet for a moment changed my
religious principles, and that I was only
waiting for a favourable opportunity to re
traft the oath. The Dulse then knelt down
before me, and asked me if he had yet time
enough left to make a general confeffion.â
I told him that he had, and that no one had 'â 
a right to interrupt him ; on which he
made a general confeflios of the whole of
' his life. After having confrfled, he asked
me with a peniteocereally fupernatural,whe
ther I believed that God would receive him
into the number of the eleft ; I proved to
him by passages and examples from the Ho
ly feriptures, that his noble repeutance, his
heroic resolution, his faith in the infinite
mercy of God, and his resignation to death
would infallibly save him. " Yes," said he,
" I die innocent of the crime of which I am
â  accused ; may God forgive my fudges as
> I forgive them. I have indeed deserved
death in order to expiate my fins. I have
â  contributed to the death of an innocent per*
' son, and thas has been my bane ; but he
- was too good v not to forgive me ; God will
* join us both with St. Louis." lam not
: able to express how much I was edified bv
r his noble resignation, his sffliftion and his '
* supernatural desire to fuffer every thing in
this and the other world fot= the expiation of
' his fins, of which he talked for a fecoud and
' final abfolutrnn at the foot of the fcaffold.
I Of these particulars you may confidently as
s sure the Duchess.
V " With refpeft to the bishop of Lydda,
t I have nothing to add, except that he told
s me at the commencement of the foi difant
Â» civil constitution of the clergy, but also the
- do&rines which he preached in his club,
r called the Iron Mouth, refpedling the Agra
rian law, the Franklin oath, &c. and that
1- he profeffed the Roman Catholic and Apof
: tolical religion. This circumstance occafi
-- oned murmurs among rhe guards who were
>e present, who told me aloud that I should
ft be guillotined as well as hfm. The Abbe
ie Fauchet, after having made his confeifion,
heard himfelf that'of S"illery.
n " Of the twenty-one deputiep,there were
1- seven who made their confeffions to me, viz.
t- Duparet, Gaudien, Fauchet, Beauvais, Le
Â»â¢ Hardi and Vagier ; Ido not recollect the
5- name of the seventh.
" BrifTot, whom I knew, did not make
<n any confeffion, but I remember that the
J > others having asked him whether he believ
'Â» ed in an eternal life in the other world, and
r - in a state of reward, he answered, " yes."

such a manner as must, we think, embarrass
the general.

" Order of cantonmatt given by the ad

HAt Saint Menehould, 200 ditto Le

" At Rheims, 5000 infantry of the line,
108 th demi brigade.
" Altogether 10,200 men.
â¢' To which are to be added four regi
ments of chasseurs, commanded by general
Ri?hepaufe, and the light infantry, and it is
easy to find 13.000 men, as well infantry a*
cavalry, part of which are yet in the depart
ment either at Rheims, where there have
been as many as 4000 men, as a letter from
th4t place of the 2d inft. states, or else at St.
Menehould and at Courtefdls, where there
are yet two regiments of chasseurs.
" Ought not the cireumftance of 13,000
men having received orders"for cantonment
in a particular territory, though not all of
them reaching it at the fame time, notwith
standing preparations made for that purpose,
to have alarmed the citizens and magistrates,
particularly in a department which had been
the viftim of every system of revolutionary
taxation, and ought not the magistrates, in
that cafe unable to defend themfclves, to
have applied to a superior authority, and have
prevented by their cares the dangers with
which they were threatened ?
" Neither the central adminiftrafion nor
myfelf were capable of fufpedling any wrong
from the defenders of the country, whose
exploits it has more than once celebrated
through my organ, nor of seeking to de
prive them of the public esteem. Had we
thought it poflible that some great attempt
**was meditating, we (hould, jfcalous of ful
filling our duty as citizens and magistrates,
have employed those means which nature
and the lav/s entrust us with, and recolledted
that the constitutional afl which confides to
ut the honorable and sacred prerogative of
convoking the French people, in cafe of the
dissolution of the legislative body, imposes
on us the duty of securing them from tyran
ny ; we (hould, if our efforts and our cries
had been ineffectual, like the Roman feira'
tora, exterminated in the streets of Rome,
while fitting in their ivory chairs, have af
forded our co.untrymen, thus threatened with
(laverr, a last: example of our devotion to
pur country, and of our refpeft to the na
tional representation."
Reply of the two united committees of the
infpe&orr of the Kail, of the council of
elders and five hundred, to the letter of
citizen Raroel, commandant of the guard
of the legislative body.
" We do not stand in need, citizen col
leagues, of the new affuranfces which you
give us, in order to appreciate the disposi
tions of the corps of grenadiers and their
chiefs towards the legislative body. Men
who have done so much for liberty, can never
abandon it, and give way to fa&ions which
seek to annihilate it, and with it the con
stitution of the 3d year. If we had only
this ftcurity it,would be fufficient ; but we
have yet further testimonies, in the exiA
difeipline which they preserve, and which
we every day witness. The testimony which
we are thus anxious of rendering them, we
wi(h to propagate ; and we doubt not that
it will destroy all the which can
fubfiil; and that our colleagues will be as

September 29.
j " The only news we have here, is the
â  sale of the Lands lying- on the .otht:r'fide of
the river, to Mr. Morris, by the Senecas ;
; there arc about three millions of acres, out
| of which they have retained 200,000 iri dif- j
I ferent placesâThe terms we do not yet

from the fale,which was effeited at Genefee.
We may now expgdl to fee the other fide

no doubt will fell in lots very high.
" The Americans have appointed a new !
commanding officer here; since his arrival,
the troops have been under arms every night
tell for fear of the Indiansâalthough thane
are none nearer than eighty miles, being as
quiet as ever in their villages, and
fatisfied with both governments. Every
body thinks it is merely a scheme, " to keep
the mens' noses more to the grind-stone,"
as their times are nearly out; and the com
mander, who is a Swiss, thinks they have
had too idle a life."
Great military and other preparations are
making at the city of New-Brunfwick, for
' the reception and entertainment of the Pre
sident of the United States, on his return to
feat of government, who is to dine with
the citizens of that place on Thursday the
9th of next month.
The apparent return of health to our sister
city, and the consequent ftfr among the j
commercial citizens of that place at this
lively season o'f the year, will not fail to
prove a source of felicitation to the citizens
at large, as well as highly advantageous to
individuals whose exteufive maritime con
cerns would render absence a serious incon
venience.

PHILADELPHIA,
TUESDAY EVENING, Octobcr 31.
Mr. Finno,
In reading the histories of tdifcoveries,
we observe not only the virtues and talents,
but likewise the vices that are attendant up
on human nature. Few authors can bene
fit mankind without perfetufion, and at
tempts of the basest kind to destroy their
well deserved reputation have been, the ge
neral consequence. Envy pursues merit as
the shadow follows the substance. Such
conÂ«lilÂ£t to those "who deserve oor warmest |
gratitude, places the human chartider in
the worst point of view. Dr. Hervey, by
the discovery of the circulation of the
blood, laid the foundation for the. most
u'feful improvements in medical science.
Few of his cotemporaiies, whom age had
rivctted to their prejudices, comprehended
or believed it ; and it was reserved for the
younger part of the profeffion to propagate
a doftrin?, which, without any farther
proofs of its truth, is now perceived instan
taneously by every fludent of medicine.
The force of education and of dulnefs were
bayicrs not only to the advancement of
this truth, but were fufficitntly powerful
to deprive this generous benefatlor of tiearly
all his praftice. Envy however flopped not
here ; for when his cotemporarics were
obliged to adopt the opinion, they attempt
ed to tSrnifh his reputation by ascribing the
discovery to some French* physician, and
some even gave the merit to the venerable
Hippocrates.âSuch is the power of truth,
and such are the fubterfuges of the envious.
The idea of being ufeful to mankind sup
ported D. Hervey under the prefTure of
persecution and poverty, and he trusted
that an unprejudiced and benefited posterity
wiuld do him justice. They could not
obviate the penury that the excrcife of his
talents brought upon him, but have consi
dered him as extlufively entitled to the merit
of difeoveripg the circulation of the blood.
They have condemned Jtis persecutors ; but,
upon a similar occasion, hive imitated their
example. Dr. Rush has introduced into
p'raftice, in this city* calomel and bleeding
in bilious complaints, and has difeovered
the efficacy of salivation in triumphing oyer
them. HÂ® to Â° has received a large share of
persecution ; and envy, forced into the eon
viftion of the propriety of these remedies,
is now attempt Trig to throw a shade. over
his charadter; but the benefited cities, his
country, and alt posterity, will eventually
do him justice. Hervey and Sydenham,
Descartes and Galileo, have each'fhared his
fate. Malice and ignorance have thought
him an objedl wortTiy'bf persecution. It
is to be-hoped, however, that the aspersions
of a few will not pre vert him from prose
cuting his enquiries, and that his talents
.will still be employed in the service of man
kind. An OBSERVER.

Yesterday arrived the (Jiip Canton, Coffin,
Isle of France, 98 days.
A ship under Danilh colours, supposed
to be the Republican, from Bremen, took
a pilot on board yesterday to the Southward
of the bar. *
Capt. Coffin informs, that the Isle of
France appeared to be in perfeft tranquil
lity,. and the slaves under the' ftrifteft sub
ordination j that the produce of the colo
nies was exceedingly high, and American
produce as low in proportion ; that many
American vessels have touched there from
Bmirdeaux, and proceeded on to Bangal.
Nine French frigates and fifteen privateers,
were out upon the different coasts of India
cruising against the English,â  and a number
of valuable prizes taken by them were daily
arriving. Good accounts were, received at
the Isle of France of an English squadron,
to the number of eight or ten ships, fitting
in Madras roads, for some secret expedition
reported to be destined against Manilla; but
the French seemed to mistrust, that their
intention was to pay them a visit; they talk
ed lightly of it, as they thought their Island
proof against the whole naval force that the
English had in the East-Indies. They see
med to be under some apprehension for their
sister colony of Bourbon. The generality
of the people appeared to be quite arifto
cratical in their principles, and talked
very loud against the present government of
France, without the least refervS as to time
or place. ( They pay great refpedt co the
American flag ; and the government, in its
dealings, behaved very honorably. Paper
money was depreciated to a very low ebb,
but there appeared to be plenty of coin in
circulation. They had heard from Europe
that Ahe governments of France and Ameri
ca laboured under some mifundcrftanding,
which they seemed much to regret. There
was news circulating and generally credited,
that the English in India were at war with
some of the country powers. A number of
French vessels were daily arriving fromÃata
via with rice. . A Danffh company ship had
arrived from Canton, dismasted ; and a Da
nish ship was standing trial, supposed *0 be
English property.
Captain Coffin left in the Isle of France,
two brigs fipm Salem, and one bark, all
bound to Bengal.
Tie ships Belifariue and Ocean had failed
about ten days for the fame plate.
Left at Bourbon, ship Nancy, of New-
York, captain Butler, bound to Batavia.
