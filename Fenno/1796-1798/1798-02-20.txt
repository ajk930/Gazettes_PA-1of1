TUESDAY EVENING, FEBHIURT le.
HI. TtNNO,
A very gross misrepresentation having
appeared in Bache's paper of Friday, ref
peding the meeting in the Northern Liber
ties you will con-eft it by publishing the
following ftateawnt :
A ovmber of eitizen* agreed to Beet at
the ho'jfc of Mr. Bender, for the parpofe of
aorainatiag a proper person to fill the oÂ£Bce
of feaator. A room was accordingly enga
ged. By this meeting it wit not intended
to expre\ the sense of the inhabitant! of
the Northern LibertieÂ» generally, but on
ly that of the citiienÂ» present. It wa* not
intended to collect people of all political
deferiptioas, but only of one ; ant) *ll who
have ever been present at mixed meetings,
â¢f men governed by d -fferent interests, and
prompted by views, rauft fee the
propriety of this intention. At such meet
isgi it is impoflibU to obtain either calmness
of deliberation, or freedom of difauffion.
It it impoflible to make any comparison, be
tween the fitnef* of the fevtral candidates, j
aAd the conduit which each will be likely
to pursue ; and where both parties remain
firm, viol tree it almost the inevitable con
ference. These being the opinions of the
gentlemen who' called the meeting, they
were much furpri/ed at the intrusion of a
number of person* who by the violence of
'their manner made it evident that they were
really determined by all the mean in their
power to bear down all opposition to their
views. They immediately cried out to
Col. Cowpcrthwait to take the chair. To
thia he objected, aud the impudence and
tyranny of attempting to place him there,
Hiuft be obvious to all ; since his sentiments
â¢a thcfufcjefl were well known, and since he
had already prelided at a meeting which had
unanimously agreed to support Mr. Morgan.
He yielded howeVer tr. their clamor, and
immediately after he had taken the chair,
fom'c man rose and made a number of ob
jefiions to admitting the ele&ors of the ci
ty to *ote at a meeting in the Northern Li
berties. After several fruitlefs attempts to
speak, made by those who were opposed to
him, they were at length heard fome
degree of attention. They stated that the
â loom was engaged by themselves, for /'ieir
own use ; that it was not their intention to
publiih the resolution as resulting from the
determination of some of the inhabitants of
the Northern Liberties only, but alfÂ® fully
to express that a number Â®f the inhabitants
of the city were present ; that several per
fnns from the Northern Liberties were at
Diifiwoody's, and were permitted to vote;
but that if it was the sense of the meeting,
thus rudely to interfere with and violently
exclude them, they their desire
to maintain peace and good order, with
draw. By this time a number of the friends
of Mr. Morgan, forefceing what was like
ly to be the event, had aftualiy gone and
their places were supplied by the friends of
Mr. Israel. As soon as the person who
made the obje&ion perceived this, he with
drew it. The room was now filled with
the mod iboifterous clamor in favor of Mr.
Israel, and the chairman declaring it to be
impoflible to preftrve order, exprefTed a
wifli to retire. It was, however, perempto
rily isfifted upon that he should remain in
his feat. A proposal was made to adjourn,
which was instantly rejefled. After a good
deal of cor.verfation among the friends of
Mr. Israel, the question was at length put
and a large majority appeared in his favor.
A refutation was then offered, declaring the
meeting to b'- unanimous : to this the chair
man objrflrd because a number of persons
of whom he was one, had voted against
Mr. Israel, and the word unanimous was
struck out. The most lingular part of the
story remains to be told, that many of those
citizens who had just hcen voting at a meet
ing in the city, came to that in the North- (
4Â»n Liberties in order to exclude others of i
their fellow citiieat, and then aftually vo- i
ted themlelves. i
The fame trick had been played at Lefh- <
er'Â» tavern on Tuesday. A number of gen- â 
tlemen agreed to meet thereâMr. Israel's ]
adherents heaid of this intention, took pof- j
feflion of the room, and entirely excluded <
them. j
I ftiall make no comanent upon tbis tranf- j
adion, nor upon the ridiculous mummery (
of Momu*. Tke public will form its own <
opinion. They will determine on which |
ide the charge of violence is fairly made. t
A SPECTATOR. t
Ml. HNHO, ]
. Your readers being now pretty well fati- t
atcd, if not forfeited with account* of the t
late debates, oecafioned by the riotous con- <
dud of some of our representatives in Con- I
grefs, -which has been considered by many t
as without a precedent even among savage
nations, and more so in the deliberate' pro- r
eeedings of any civilized body ; I wilh to t
whet their appetites with an account of a y
(tnilar nature, and not very dissimilarppri-t
eiples; by whichanoldadage will be ftrcngth- <
ened, namely " that there is nothing new un- t
der the fun." I shall not carry you to and- i
tnt Rome, ncr yet xÂ» modern Paris, for <
myprecedent; buttoWESTMiNSTER-Hxn, i
(in the corrupt times of Charles II.) where ;
there appears to have been a Frem/i party, i
and an Fr.gVfh party, at Loggerheads, and
tomething like Spitting arguments, as well
at clui-argvments in the cafe. See Grey's
debates of the Houfr of Cpmmonsi which
be fays, prefeated, on that occasion, a
" feene the meft reproachful to the nation,
â¢ad the most dangerous to the public Wei
ll*."
An address having been presented to the
King, to recall bit fubjeds then in the fer
tile of tVc French King, from wliofe aanbi
tiont vivwi against bit German neighbours,
. the balance of Power was likely to 'be de
stroyed, and great danger apprehended to
England; the King gave an evafire answer;
alledging, on certain principle* of honor,
which his minifteri refufed to disclose to Par
liament, " that such of his subjects as were
in the most christian King's ferviee, before
the last treaty was made with the States Ge
n" eral, were become inconftderable, and cannot
? be recalled, without endangering the peace
he then enjoyed ; [with France- and hit O
ther neighbours} but that he would renew
his proclamation, to prohibit the going over
of any more."
This answer, not fatisfying tlie majority
of Parliament,who efpouied the part of
e country, and were not afraid of mar with
2 France, the house resolved itfelf into a grand
Â£ committee for committee of the m/hole) on
the fubjeft of a neiu address to the Kitfgâ-
( The debates were warm and turbulent }
. some quotations from them are as follows:
1 Mr. Garroway â" This is one of'the
0 ferfoufeft bufinefles that ever v/fs in this
houfe. The King of France is ready to o
verrun os all, if his conquests go onâWhat
e soever we do in this world, let us reprcfent
the fears of his [tie King's] people, of the
growing greatness of France."
Sir Wm. CoYkwTRT, on this fobjeS,
speaking of grievances in general, fays, "ho
' is not forward to present any ; but there it
' one. above all, [the growing greatness oI
1 France] that concerns us all to tnink ofâin
refpetft of this, " all other things are but
c trifflesâThe end of France's conquests, it I
' not for trade. The whole bent of France
PiÂ» to consider what next thing he will under
take, if he get reft again. Having tlmtjl
fwallatued Flanders, â¢will he not begin again ?
[ He kept nut' Ho/land, because Germany
would not endure itâlf Flanders be fwal
-1 lowed up, there is nothing betwixt us and
| France âWe are not making Laws to bind
France, but would make an humble address
' to the King, that as tve have a care of hit
concern, he would have a care of ours."
Sir Thomas Clargbsâ"This griev
ance of Franee is a matter of so great con
feqnence, that if there be no tendency of
redrcfling it this day, wcart lost âHe fears
the King is betrayed."
Mr. Malletâ" Knows not the benefit
we have from the French, but that they
fetch our horse and our men, and we have
nothing from them but Wine and Women."
On the other fide, the ministerial party
held up the dangers of war with France.â
" Will you,"' fays Sir Giorgi Down
ing, who was believed to be under the pay
or corrupt influence of France, "will you
hazard a war, rather than lose Flanders, in
the condition weare in? They may reproach
us, as they did King James, by pifturing
him in Holland with an army of ambassadors
to secure the Palatinate." The address to
the King was nevertheless finally carried.
The tumult now to be noticed, was on
the firft putting #f the qiteftion in the grand
committee, when the House divided, and it
reported at follows.
" The tellers, viz. Sir Trevors Williams,
and Sir John Hanmer, appointed by the
Chairman, Sir Chirles Harboard, differing
in their account of the Yias and Noes,
some called " Tell again," others " Report"
on which great disorder began; gentlemen
rising from their places, and mingling in the
Pit. Hot and provoking difcovrfes and ges
tures pasTed on both fides, especially be- '
twixt Lord Cavendilh, and Sir John Han
mer.âSome said, the Lord Cavendifh'i
sword was half drawn out, but prevented by |
Mr. Raflel, who kept close te him. Othert I j
said, that Lord Cavendijh spit in Sir John 'â 
Hanmer't face ; but that was only eagcrnefs '
of speech, and fa some ffpittle'] might acci- '
dentally fly from him. \_S>uere âHow wat
th* spitting among ut ? By accident or de- ,
figÂ® -'J But to proceed w'th the narrative j
_ " Sir James Smith, setting his arms on
his fide, did, in a rude manner, make thro'
the crowd, and jollied several, and came up :
to the table, when yet more hot difcourfet '
passed between him and Lord Cavendilh, Mr.
Stackdales Mr. Sacheverell and othert; Mr.
Stockdale&fomcothcrs,fetting their feet up
on the Mace, which lay belowtlfetable.inthe
usual place at grand committees. This dis
order continuing near half an hoÂ«r, the ftan
dert-by on the upper benches, expe&ing
very fatal confeqirences, especially when the
young gallants, as Mr. Thynne, Mr. New
port and others, leaped over the feats to join
lord Cavendish. But the Speaker, very
opportunely and prudently rising from his
feat near the Bar, in a resolute and flow
pace, made hit three refpeftt through the
crowd, and took the Chair. The Mace,
was still retained by the said gentlemen ;
but at last, being forcibly laid on the table,
all the aiforder ceased, aÂ«d thegentlemen went
to their places. The Speaker being fat,
spoke to this purposeâ" that, to bring the
House into order again, he took the chair,
though not aceordirtg to order." Some gen-
I tlemen, as Mr. Sacheverell and others, ex
cepted against hit coming into the chair,
but the doing it was generally approved, as
the only expedientto suppress the disorder.
" Sir Thomat Lee moved " that there
might be an engagement pasTed, upon the ho
nour of every member, flanding up in his
place, to proceed no farther in any thing
that had happened in the unfortunate disor
der at the grand committee, which was se
conded by several, and consented to by every
member, flanding in his place. The next
day, after a tedious debate, it wat Resolved
that a further address be presented to his
Majefly, for re-calling his fubjeÂ£ti that are
in the ferviee of the French king."
Every publisher of a newspaper, who may
think this narrative worthy of his notice
muftibe left to make his own comments and
comparisons refpefting both cases, and their
termination upon the honour of the parties
pledg'd to give no further interruption to
the important business of the feflion ; altho*
with this difference, that the interrup
tion in one eafc wat but fop an hour perbapt,
while on the other it -has consumed many
precious days to the public. But no censure â 
it meant to bt conveyed by this remark ;
p-.rl.Lpt ;ram the fuKi"i(lin<Â» aiiiinofiiits, the
length of the drbitet could n<Â»i Vr aroiied';
and in the one cafe, a fat lord, in the vehe
mence of argument brfpattering or btfl.ib
bering the face of hit antagnnitt, may have
appeared a laughable circumtiance, ratber
thin a premeditated affront. By what mcauj
the Speaker of the House of Cammoni got
polTiffion of his chair, and had the Mace
rcftored to the table, if the Chairman of
the committee of the whole fat in the Speak
er'Â» place, is not fully related ; unless it be
fuppafed that the Chairman, in the confuli
on of the committee, had descended into
the pit, or voluntarily quitted the chair on
the approach of the Speaker, who (ac
cording to the narrative) deserved much
i credit, in boldly venlniingto tranfgrrfi or
der Itimfelf, that he might reltore order to
' tli(S house. The Speaker of our American
: H )ufe of ReprcfeHtatives wai not called to
thiÂ« fevcre trial, as the house was in session,
nor perhaps would he have been so easily
forgiven ; hut his manly and dignified eon
duft, have-convinced the public of hi? sens.
and fpir.'t to maintain order in the import
ant Ration aifigncd to hiin.

The most obvious of all political truths
it that the citizens of the United States are
a divided people. Discord and fafiion are
engraved on the front of almost every pub
lic ir.tafurc.

The PHILOSOPHY of POLITICS.
In all natural bodies there is andmuft be fjme
centre of gravity, towards which all the consti
tuent parts of tits Uody tend, and oa which
they reft: This is the cafe with the globe on
which we live; light and rolling fubliances on
its furface may be moved by the winds or other
ways contrary to'the power of gravitation;
and even more solid parts of the earth may be
difturbrd by still greater force, such as earth
quakes and like events; fiill, the power ofgrav
i y remaining, all will return to reft again : Bat
Ihould the power of gravitybe destroyed all the
psrts would separate inconfufion, and the body
no longer remain.
in the particulars above mentioned, a politi
cal body very much refemblet a natural body.
In a republic ihc public good determined by the I
public will, at exprefled by the representative
government, must be considered as the political
centre of gravity. While any important fub
jc& it under the consideration of the govern
ment and ripening to a determination, a free
communication of fentirnents ind arguments,
made with decency and propriety, both in the
several departments of government and elfe
wbere, work no injury to the body, but are
means of finding the public will, and when that
is found and exprefled by government, all op
pofition,|oppugnariott and tumult are like winds,
hurricanes and earthquake! to the natural body,
and ftiould they prevail to deflroy the centre,
would eSexually dellroy the body.
In all political bod eb this will of the fame
must be determined by the majority, though
ever so small, otherwise there would be no cen
tre : When there is a considerable minority, it is
exceedingly prcne to b?come difaÂ£eÂ£ed to the
majority, and troublesome to the body. Soon
after the United States had declared themfel. es
independent, and each state had appointed itÂ»
own government, as well as a rallying point for
the whole,thereappeared from time to time a dif
affe&ed minority, who had reconrfe to commit
tees of correspondence, county conventions, %nd
many to embarrass and op
pose government : Those difaffested minorities
have been differently denominated fr mi time
to time, according to some leading circumstan
ces, which it is needless to mention. Thefepeo
pie seem to consider rhemfelves on a par with,
or rather superior to the government of the re
public, and call it a party, a fa&ion, a junto, and
the like ; âWith how little reason ind t.-uth can
such people call themfelvcs republicans ?
As the globe which we inhabit and each of
the primary planets in the solar system has and
must have its own centre of gravity to hold the
constituent parts c so they all have and must
have relation to one common centre, the fun,
to prevent them from interfering with each o
ther, or flying off in right lines and losing their
relative titrations. In this refpeA a number of
bodies politie, or independent states, referable
the solar system : If the United States should
forget their own independence and yield to fo
reign influence, they would become like one of
the primary planets should it lose its relation to
the common centre of the system and gravitate
towards a neighbouring one; in which cafe it
must either approach such neighbouring planet,
and both fall into one common mass, or by los
ing its situation as a primary planet become on
ly a fatcllite to its new neighbour. Or Ihould
the ynited States be divided between the influ
ence of two or more different foreign nations,
they would become like a planet which ftiould
lose its situation in the system aforefaid, and
yield to the attraction of two or more of the
peighbouring planets indifferent directionsâin
which cafe it must be separated and draw to
wards the neighbouring planet, pr perhaps filial*
ly dragged in whole towards the ltrongeft at
tracting body.
When in a well organized republic, any in
ternal affair has been fully considered and de
bated, and the public will declared by the cort
ftituted authority Â©f the state, it seems rather
imprudent, officious, and the effedl of difap
pointrnent, for those wfto fall into the minority
to keep vp aconllant cUmtur against the pub
lic. wil! fodrclared i hut when any puWic traaf-J
litfiioi has taken place between such constituted
uthority and a foreign state, after a full investi
gation both in the povernment and among# the
people at large. Wh*i can be more weak, ab
surd and wicked, if net treasonable, than for the
minor part, who, di r contentrd with such transac
tion, iball exasperate and intrigue with o:her
foreign ftitesor nations Sgainft their own gov
ernment i ( Would to God such a thing existed
only in the imifrinition, and had never been re
alized in the United States, although now de
clining.)
Such condud terd> greatly to leffcn the dignity
and importuned Â»f any nation, and is as absurd
as it would he for a man when he waÂ» about to
fell any eomnio ity, if in ortfrr to find the weight
of it he (hould place one part in one fcaW. and tlu
remainder in rhe other. It is presumed there is bÂ«
perfan that cannot fee the propriety of tl>s compa
rison ; but these people will tell thev are not to
Mume, the fault is en the other fide, i e. they
know better what is for the public gooa than ..the
rcpuhlicau gvivsrumont. Wliy do ;hÂ«.y uoccome
out ftankly and acknowledge their vrrur in joining
to cftabliih a repul>kcan goveri nunr, and return
to an hereditary monarchy; but let them be aware
of a lianted monarchy, for in fuck a government
the will of the monarch himftlf muk be in a de
grew controled
When the United States threw offthe govern
ment of Great-Britain, every intelligent man
knew that they must have some governrmnt or
..other, and when they tftablifhed a republican
government every intelligent man knew that
it must be administered by fallible men, and
that they might fometimea mistake the true in
terests of the people ; but what sre we ra do in
that cafe ? The anf\ver is plain,inft-ad ofdrench
ing the eat th is blood, and fprnding couatlefs
millions to procure a revolution, and which per
haps failing at last, the people have in their con j
ftitution established periodical revolutions, when
all the adrainiftrators of government are diverted
of all authority and returned to the mass Â«f the
people, and others are ele<fted in their room
But still the body of the people con lifts of falli
ble men, and may err ia their ele&ions. What
shall we then do ? (ah! there is the pinch )
It has been the maxim of despots that the peo
ple have not wisdom fuflkient to govern them
lelves ; but we .Americans trust they have, awfl
time must diieover which are right:âThis is
certain, that, if they cannot govern themfelvcs
by free eledlions, our cafe is deplorable, and we
must be governed by despots. UNITY.

Euphorbus was a father. That is, he
was affcÂ£lionateto his family and benevolent

diflolufely oae. Their authority among their
children was not on their lads, but In their
hearts. What was the life of Euphorbus ?
âHis tendcrnefs ind philanthropy were,
like the mountain Oak, deep rooted. Like
that, he repelled, with dignity, the florms

genuine love and kindness, returned them,
reciprocally, to their parents. One chain

as the opinion Â»f the committee, that that
which goes to prevent the reconfidrration of
a vote when there are fewer members present
than when it originally passed, ought to be
adopted; but that the one which would
prevent a motion for adjournment from being
in order, when another motion was before
the house, ought not to be agreed to.
Mr. Nicholas wished this report to be
committed to a committee <sf the whole.
Me was not ready to vote upon it j to fay
that no number of members less than had a.
greed to a certain proportion was compe
tent to agree tÂ« another, and of course that
a majority of the house could not do the bÂ»-
finefs of the house.
The report was accordingly committed.
Mr. Dawfon wished the refalution which
he had laid upon the table, on the fubjeft
of admitting persons, who attended the
house for the purpose of taking an account
of its debates and proceedings, within the
ba!r of the house, to be taken up and refer*
red to the fame committee of the whole.
The was accordingly read.
Mr. Sitgreaves thought it would be more
eligible that' this proportion for amending
the rules should have the fame coarse as o
thers, especially as, from the information of
the Speaker, it appeared that the objeft of
thjs refolntion was in praftice, with the ex
ception of one individual note-taker, jwho
had abused the privilege and insulted- the
Speaker and the authority of the house. It
was proper therefore thit the faft fliould be
stated, so as that the houfc might aft upon
it.
Mr. Dawfon had no objeftion to the re
ference the gentleman from Pennsylvania
had pointed out, it was his opinion, howe
ver, that the other would' have been tbe
more direst course.
It was accordingly rtferred to a feleft
committee.
Mr. Harper asked whether the bill provi
ding the means ofForeign Intercoarfe, could
now be considered as unfiniflied : business,
having been poltpoued to day certain?
The Speaker answered in the affirmative.
It had been poflponed to day certain: that
day was arrived, and it had ncJW a preference
to other business.
Mr. Hartley presented the petition of a
number of merchants, traders, and other*
of Philadelphia, praying that some new
Piers may be erefted at Newcastle, and that
the old ones may be repaired.
Some difference of opining arising as tÂ«
the proper reference of this petitfon ; Messrs.
Hartley and Livingfton being is favour of
a reference to the Committee of Commerce
and Manufactures ; and Messrs.' Sitgreaves,
Gallatin and Kittera, for a reference to tht
Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Coit sug
gested the propriety of k# lying on the table
till to-morrow, as he recollefted the fecrete
ry of this Treasury had already made a re
port upon the fubjeft whicfi was referred ta
the committee of Commerce and Manufaft
ures, but he did not know whether or uot
that committee had reported. He wished
time to enquire. Agreed.
Mr. Thatcher said, that on the 20th Ja
nuary, 1795, a petition was presented from
Tobias Lord, and others, praying for leave
to ereft a Pier in Kennebunk river, that
anÂ«ft had been passed authorizing the ereft
ionoffaid Pier under fudh regulations as
should be determined by a law of the State.
He had now received the law which
had been passed, whie h he laid before the
house. The law and papers accompanying
it were referred to the committee of cons,
roerce and manufaftures.
Mr. Davis said, a petition had bee* this
morniug presented, and he had had others
sent to him to present, on the fubjeft of the
North western Territory Lands. He thought
something might be dene on this business,
which-would not only answer the â¢ i'lhes '<>{
the f*ttlers, but might also be beneficial to
the United States. For this purpofe,he pro
posed a refutation which he wished to be re
ferred to the committee appointed an this
fubjeft, proposing certain advantages to
fettleis in that territory, which was agreed
to.
Mr. Gallatin moved that the unfinifhed
business should be poftpomd in order to take
up the report of the committee of claims on
the expediency or inexpediency of excepting
certain claims from the operation of the aft
of limitation ; which being agreed to the
House resolved itfelf into a committee of
the \\ hole on that fubjeft ; and agreed to a
refolntion proposing to suspend for a limited
time, the law barring Loan Office Certifi
cates, final Settlements and Indents of In
tcreft ; and alfato a refolusion is tbt formrecemmendei by the Secretary o(the Trja.
fury, viz.âRefoNed,
" That a time be limited by law, after
which credit on thr books of the Trea fury
Tor tranfadions during the late war, which
accotdiag to the course of the Treasury,
have hitherto btrn aifeharged by i filling
certificates of regiflerrd debt, (hall be barr
ed and declared void, unless claimed by the
proper creditor! or their legal reprefenta-
Bfer"
And, upon motion of Mr. T. Claiborne
the following resolution was agreed to, 45
to 40.
" Resolved that a committee be appointed
to bring in a bill for the relief of Amy Dar
din."
This claim has been long before Congress
and been several times the fubjcCt of difewf-
Son. It is for the value of the famous horse
Romulus, the property of th: hafband of
the petitioner, prelfed into the service of the
United States daring the war. The cafe 1
ef the widow is evidently * hard one, and
this is the second time a vote has been ob
tained in her favour, which has afterwards
been reversed.
The committee rose, reported their a
greement to ifce three refolutiona, and had
leave to fit again. The house took up the
twofirft, agreed to them, and direCted the
committee of claims to bring in 1 bill or bills
accordingly. When the fame resolution
came to be considered, the Yeas and Nays
were called for, and its adoption ftrong'y op â¢
pufed by Messrs. Harper, Nicholas, and
Bayard, on the ground of its throwing op
en a doortoevery claim which had heretofore
been determined as barred, as cutting up by
the root all the ads of limitation, that it
was also setting aside these laws in the mod
objectionable way, by inviting every per
son who had an unfatisljed claim to petition
Congress for relief, which would o?courfe
en K a Â£ c much ef their timt; if the aCis were
to he set aside, it would be much better,
and less expensive, therefore, to authorize
the proper Department to fettle these claims
f than that the time of the house should be en
gaged in investigating and fettling them.
On the other hand, its adoption was ad
vocated by Messrs. Gallatin and T. Clai
borne. This was dated as a hard cafe; that
this determination would not open the aCts
ef limitation to any but such as Congress
wight deem extremely hard cases; that it
would give the Treasury no power whatever
to fettle any claim; the power, therefore,
could not be abused, except they themselves
abused it; that whatever policy there might
be in aCts of Limitation, they were certain
ly liable to strong objections; they knew
they were honourably indebted a sum of mo
ney, but they are determined not to pay it,
merely because the paying of it might ren
der the accounts at the Treasury less simple,
or bccaufe they would be liable to pay more
than is convenient. This policy might be
juftifiable, but it bore very hard upon indi
vidual fufferers. It was argued, therefore,
that without opening the aCts generally,
when a strong, unequivocal claim was pre
sented, which was in the hands of the ori
ginal holder, and wlere, of course, there
could be no pnflibility of fraud, relief might
and ought to be granted.
Mr. J. Williams was a* enemy to aCts of
Limitation; as he thought a debt once due,
must always be due until paid; but he
would either have them open generally or
net at all.
The yeas and nays upon agreeing to this
proposition for setting aside the aft'of 1 imi
tation in this cafe (and of coarse in all o
thers which would have borne comparison
with it as to its justice) were as follow:

MR. FINNO,
I cannot conceive that th* power of paf
r fieri and party prejudice can fa inflame the
J mind, and obfeure the operations of feafoa
e that a majority of our fellow citizens will
f be induced to vote for Israel Israel in pre
ference to Benjamin R. Morganâto name
the two charafters in competition proves
that it is a party quejlion, and the good citi
zens are to determine which is to ptevail, a
f faftion, or the friends of their constitution
*! and government. Among the various ftrat
r agems, and vile falfehoods, by which the
anarchills endeavour to accomplish their di
s abolical views, I know of none more feri
otifly alarming, than that of which an ac
count was given in your paper of yesterday.
' At several of the late meetings of the eÂ»e
---c j mies of our government, I am told, h has
been aflcrted, that the fcderalifts intend ap
pearing on the eleftian ground armed.â
While we cannot but Ihudder at the idea,
shat we hare mifvreants among us, who
could boldly publilh so daring a falfehood,
' we camot at the fame lime be ignorant of
their views. The time is not yet come when
* they lhall dare to fay to their co-adjutors,
" arm yomfclvesâthe federal part are lovers
Â» of peace and order, we are not the moll nu
merousâtherefore we will intimidate, they
- will be afraid to appear on the ground."
r ThiÂ« is what they dare not openly avew,
â¢ yet to my mind their language forcibly iai
o plies the fame. But are the friends of peace
- and order to be intimidated? No, the lan
f S ua g e 'be failion wiil aroufc them from
their fupfnenefs, they will now behold the
necessity of supporting the government and
'. railing their country to that degree of nati
onal dignity, as not to be endangered by fo
reign influence, or txpoftd to be (haken by
s the atts of seditious foreigners. The fame
- fpirif which has fuak the citizens of France
. in misery, and been the parent of crimes o
e ver which humanity must foreverweepâthat
fame spirit a&uates the faftion in this conn
try. And it now becomes the interest and
the duty of every good citizen to exert his
_ influence and exercise his rights, thathe may
contribute his all, to avert the dangers to
j which his couutry is exposed. When he
j (hall have done this, he will have performed
duti.a which he owes to himfelf, his God
and his country. But if the peaceful citi
zen is to be intimidated from giving his
vote, this Will encourage the faftion in their
s viewsâthis will be success to the utnoft of
their wiihes. Then " they will', like Buo
naparte, CONQU E R ALL BEFORE TÂ«tM."
Then all powerwill be fubmittedto the hands
of a mobâinfnrreftirji will become the or
der of the day, our houses will no longer
t remain otir catties, and peace, happiaeft and
f security will be banilhed from among us.

fioh that a publication for general benefit, and rt
tenfive information, will receive ai much fupporc
from the liberal minds of the merchant* and other*
of this city, as places of less opulence in theUci
ted Statesâand although little immediate benefit
should result to the eitiÂ«en. Irom fiich a publica
tion, yet it might prevent an idea abroad which
some have .nduflrioxfly circulated, that the trade
a j C * tCn Clt * wa,on decline, and con
traded into so narrow a sphere that it would not
support a Price Current.
The general anxiety that prevails in the com
mercial world at thi* critical pcriad, renders a
work ot the kind particularly ufeful and neceiTarf
jâ Nor can the utility be doubted, whel it is cna-
Udercd how extenfivoa the trade and particularly

AT a juncture when the qutflion of
a Com met eial Treaty vtitb France may soon
become an ohjcA of discussion, a work of this kind
hecoa.es extremely ufclut to those sitizen* of the
United States, who may be defirons to enable them
selves to view this fubjed, under its various af
pe&s ; and they will have the fatisfa&ion to be
furnifhed with the neeeflary data, to judge of the
ufeiulnefs of this tranfadion.
This work is principally diftinguilbed by the
richncfs of the observations, the pirfpieuity of the
iÂ«cas. and the modeily of the theory which it
contains. t Pars, a man of wit observed, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufotul produce. It iÂ» addref â¢
fed to the unfortunate La FaYitte, in letters,
which fugitive fo r m, the author who could only
devote a lew weeks to this occupation, was Â«.bliged
â¢o adopt. Although eircunill sticks art ill many
rcfpe&s different at the present day, from what
they were in the year i79">, when these letters
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so ma
ny abfoluteard permanent dau (till remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lefsou that account on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the rc
fijlt of the author's remarks, it will fcrvc to con
vince him that in all tr&afadions, between free
nations, every thing maybe cxpo&edfrom the Â«f
forts of truth and justice.
LETTER I.
General view of ths obftacles.'cr sated in France,
to prevent the cxtenfion of commerce, with the
IT nurd StatesâObservations made in a tour, taken
for thut cxprefs purpose, nponfomc French manu
factures (a precious fragmv.<*l this). Examination
and refutation of the prejudices existing in France,
against the quality of certain produdions of the
United States, and against the advantages of their
importationâDemomlration of the bad policy of
laying duties on their importation, principally on
previ lions in general, and on fait provisions, and
fi(h in pa- ticularâConfederations on the regulations
of the French culiom-houies.
LETTER 11.
Obllaclcs to the cxtenfion of trade with France,
proceeding from Circumfiances and individuals in
the United StatesâProofs that these obstacles are
only temporary and will be removed (they have
been removed) by time and thewifdomof govern

of the llagnation of American trade, after the
peaceâCritical examination of French < s oods, im
ported into America, and extraordinary conduA
of the French merchantsâEfieds of good com
mercial laws; ardpatriotic wiftieson thisfubjedâ
Observations on money, weights and mcafures.
LETTER 111.
Eftayin the form < f a tableau, to appraise tbt im
ooitations into the United SlatesJrom France and Fngm
land united. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better furniihed from France or
Englandâlt is principally on this fubjeS (which
would haveaftoniftitd a mere thtorift) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
Kind of tableaux, uuiuckily as difficult to obtain at
ihey are much to be defiled, are the only fuie guides
the ftatefirian can take for the policy of treaties, de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We c?nrÂ»ot too much admire the apparent ex
adoefs of colonel Swan's calculations ; and although
the propkefies of Lord Sheffield have already been
ecu rarii&eil by experience, and by fevcrai able pens,
yet it is curious to fee the author of the prelent work,
difpuie with him the only grout d on which he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the required condition, will be better able
than Gicat Britain to supply us with several articles,
which tha Englilh authoi allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's patriality ajfeft an (if he
has any) does not appear to have at any time created
Â» partiality of judgment. The result of this calculation
is that in >709, that is to fay, at a period when arts
and manufadures did sot present in France the vast
means and probability of cxtenfion which they now
poffrfs. that even in 1789, it was presumable, that
France would not only have the means to supply one
half of any given auantity of the produdions of Franct
and I ngland uniteÂ«, but also to enter into competition
with Great Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wildom of ber government, and the industry
of her inhabitants.
LETTER IV.
Calculation of the exportations of the United States,
and particular examination of their fuitablencfs to
France ; this is one reason why, notwithstanding the
excellent woik of Mr. Tench Coxe, Mr. Swan's ta
bleau is by no mean* fupafluous . the principle of the
advantages which would result to France from the
importation t.f provisions and raw materials, is every
where applied ; and it is upon thin argument, that
the author establishes his demands to the French go
veinment, for the limited adtnifHon of the produc
tions ot his country into Frantc.
LETTER V.
Tableau, of the debt of the United States at that
timeâOpinions of the author on the finances, on the
effc&sof national debt, on circulation, Ac. as more
amply detailed in his National Arithmetic printed at
Boston in the year 1786 ; the whole calculated to
flrengthen in France, the pubi c and private credit
of the United Statesâthe happy condition of Ameri
ca, and the miseries arising from the public debt in
Europe, are contiafted in the abled manner, and un
der the moll finking iela:ions, by very cu ious cal
culationsâObservations on the wisdom and economy
which preside over the public expenses in Maflachu
fetts. In this place the patriotism of the author ap
pears, with all the elevation wh'ch ajuft national
pride inlpi et,. rhe ancient governments ofÃnrope,
fays he, will (earn from us the art of economy in
recompcnfing the frivices which the country receives:
Among fl us it u ilt % be seen, that men are chajen Jar places,
and not placesfi.* men. This letter coi.ciud<s wnh a
general view of the public property, deposited in the
hands of the government of the United States.
LETTER VI
General cxaminatiou ot the defeats of the commer
cial policy of France with refpett to the United States ;
many ol these observations have produced the effids
for which they 1 were intended, others still remain
pointing out the reforms ro bemad- iÂ« futuic, as a
