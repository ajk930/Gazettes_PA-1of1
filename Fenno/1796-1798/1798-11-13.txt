DEDICATORY ADDRESS,
Spokenbv Mr. HodÂ«kinson, Oft 2q, at the open
ing ot the NEW FEDERAL THEATRE, and, by
dcliie, on the 30th Oft. the evening ot the Presi
dent's Biith Day.
Wrutin by THOMAS PAINS, A. M.
Author of Adams and Liberty, &c. &c.
rThf old Federal Theatre few deflroyed by fire Feb.
41 1798 four years after it wasfrfi ere fled*
Fiamrrm refe&um, ruinit vircfcit.
ONCE more, kind patrons of the Thcfpian art,
Friends to the science of the human heart,
Behold the temple of, the rnufc Â«fp' rc Â» ,
A Phctnix Stage, which propagates by Ff RE!
Each fault refunded, and each grace renew'd,
By magic rear'd, and with enchantment view'd,
Our dome, new mantled,-mid its ravag'd wall,
Stands, like Ant*vs, stronger by its fall: â
And like Cuiusa'sghoft, in Trojan itrife,
Itsfpeflre rises larger than its life !*
Ye, who nave oft with pleas'd obfcrvance trae'd e
Each latent charm our mimic life has l
Whose hearts yet ache, when retrofpe&ion views Â£
The woes and wanderings ot the scenic Muse,
Since from the cradle of her young renown,
Her infant warbling* lur'd the listening town,
To the dark atra, when one luckless hour Â°.
Her empire ravag'd, and dethroned her power,
Till proudly towering o*er the Gothic waste t
Thro' chaos fmil'd this' paradise of taste : j
The mystic maids who hcrÂ« unite their reign, i
Whom bards and a&ors oft implore in vain,
With truth's warm rapture, bid you welcome all, q
Gents, belles, ana godfhips, to their fairy hall, â a
Where Shakes? car's spirit, who delights to flit
O'er critics' nofei, fncing in the pit, â
Like Hamlets father, arm'd from casque to sandals,
Shall â¢* visit oft the glimpses of"âour candles !
If blest by those kind fmiles,whofe beams impart* -
Pulse to the brain, and vigor to the heart,
The Drama now her languid powers will rear,
The laugh awaken, and exhale the tear ;
Cprreft, yet animate, (he aims to -oin, n
Sal vatoh's clouds,with Hogarth's waving line, r
And hopes, afpiriog f by your favour warm'd,
Again to charm you, as (he once has charm'd. J
Xor need her friends, with fear's retorted glance, Â£
Recall the horrors of her late tftifchauce, 3
When wrapt in burning flames, and awful gloom, v
She saw her temple mouldering to her tomb !
tyo more (hall Nero's ravifhVl eye behold,
The usurping element t|tefc walls enfold;
Nor sHall one tear from houseless genius start, â¢Â« " r
To glut the lavage pleasure of his heart!
To guard our fane, Apollo tun'd his lyre, {
And leagued the Gods of water aod of fire - /â¢
Crump'd VulCan deign'd his Cyclop den to quit, _
And clothe in Panoply toe Dome of Wit; *
While NsfTvut gave an urn, of such vast use, v
Tis always filling, like the widow*s cribe ! Â£
Now, (heaven forbid I) by hidden ways and t
means,
Shoald whelming fire again invest our scenes,
Left on your heads the b'azing roof Ihould fall, r
We'll spring the /Iqueduft, and drown you all'A a
" J'l'bvm Jirjf,fmoke a spruce young Bobby, f
li Spta/h me, I (ha'n't be fit to walk the lobby ! ,
"J, ? row ' ~J word,your fire commence, Sir}
41 That elownifh water a/waysfpots my fpenter !"
How wife men differ! Water, fom; would think,
Would walh away the stain of taylor'sink ! C
But don't swoon, beaus 1 another mode we'll try, I
To favcyour lives, and keep jour ruffles dry. a
From foe and water, your escape is certain ;
, Your shield of fafety is our IRON CURTAIN I 1
][The Iron Curtain is here let down) F
[HereMr Hodcki nson retires as if fimfhing the Ada G
dress, then return* haflily, and speaks in great agitation ;J
Ladies and Gentlemen ! my duty claims,
To tell you that our Stage is all in flames !
The fire, tho'ltrange to yoa tht fight misfit be,
First caught Afount B/ane, and then burnt up the sea;
The aStors, UktOffaznan from the cave,
Run htom the Green room, not to help, but rave; â' 1
While each one scampers in the others' way, *
Like fops' umbrellas in a rainy day I
But lei no belle in fvVeet hyfleiics fall,
Our IRON CURTAIN willprotect you ail /
(Curtain rises.) $
In elder time, when firft the Stage was rear'd,
â¢Twas nurs'd by patriots, and by traitors fear'd ;
Its glowing scenes the fire of States fupplitd,
For Valor*t praises wak'd Ambition's pride
And (till the Drama, with co'reÂ£led zeal,
Exist* an engine of the public weal.
Smear'd wi.h Sedition, should the hand profane
Of plotting knaves, our nation's Chief arraign,
The indignant Stage would glory in the talk,
From lurking demagogues to strip the mask j a
Drag the dark iraitor into public shame, f
And naii him to thepil'ory of fame ! v
In fucii a cause, the powers of verse would rife,
'Till, fear'd and headless, Fa&ion's hydra dies;
And the stern Eagle would suspend his wing,
TÂ® listen while the Federal Muses fÂ»ng.|| t
No (cite of clime can long proteÂ§ a lace, il
Whose fouls are reckless of their realm's disgrace,
Bid stormy oceans roll, and mountains rife,
FACTION will crofsthem, and pollute your fkias; ?
Her curs'd miasma speeds its fatal way, il
The gale impregnates, and attaints the day; h
Her fubcleroot with equal vigor flrikes, r
In Gal'ia's hotbed t or in Holland's dykes.
On coldefl (bores, her rank luxuriance grows, )
As Hecla flames mid Thule's endlcls foows. C
Where Laws are fafhion'd by the public
The helm of state demands a mailer's {kill.
The social con pa A is a bond ft weak,
The feuds of party can the cement break ;
When crack'd, like RvMit'idrop it mocks con
trol,
Snap but the Join/, and the athole.
In such mild dimes, if irye to freedom's cause,
The people's virtue will support the laws ;
And Public Spirit crush, with arm elate,
The fiend, who dares Â«â¦ to clog the wheels of ftate/'
In Frmcc, whose motley breed extreme, delight,
Who grin like nuOttyl, or like tygcrt fight,
Autun'j meek pnelt, whose conieience know* ao
qualm,
Except the cravings ofan itching palm
Who, born a nufir. and . prelate rear'd
His flock dcfcrifd, when their fl-ece was IKear'd
The ancient patriots from their nhches jostles,
And calls French fnrtttt, Liberiy's epoSkj !
This tho' the B| mop spoke it, is no brae.
For he a the Judas, and ftiil bean the bt[ !
But thanks to heaven, who propp'd our waver
ing Date,
*nd fjv'd its glory from Venetian fate,
Thssjf/4iiw* knave in vain has wound hit maze,
In vain his bafihjk qifhai ftx'd its giz; ;
In vain the holy pimp his t >ils has fp-tad,
And (mooth'd Diwak's lap for Samp/un's head!
Led to the altar, by his wiles enfnat'd,
Columbia flood, for facrifice prepared;
High Ham'd the pyre } her ilruggling arms were
bound ;
The steel waa lifted for the fatal wound ;
When, like the Angel, who by Gori'n command,
The-filial off'rioe f.v'd frÂ«>m Atrakam'i hand,
Our guardian ADAMS, rob'd in light divine,

MORE
About the XVIII. Century.
Mr. Fenjjo,
In this general scarcity. of.news, please to
indnlge an old correspondent wiÂ»h a small
portion, in one of the columns of your
very ufcfut paper, for another scrap con
cerning the eighteenth century. All the
pieces you have hitherto publifhcd en the
fubjeft have been written to defend one
lide of the queltion, except the quota
tions from Porcupine's gazette; and un
lefÂ» some other reply appear, I am afraid
the important fubjeA will be dropped.
WHEN we travel through time orfpace,
and compute our ptogrefs, we generally
speak, or write, on whaf is pad. Thus,
when we journey on a road, and come to a
mile-ilune, whether of 1 or of 100, we fay
so much is pad : the (lone is not plau#J at
the beginning of the mil?, but at the end of
it- It is iieceffary to fettle this idea clearly.
When I take out my watch, and, looking
on the dial, behold the hand pointing to i,
in a second of time more, I fay that one
hour is past, and it is going for 2. In the 1
fame manner, when I fay that my fan is one
year, or nine years old, I mean that his firft
or his ninth year is pall, and that he has
entered into his second or tenth year. So,
if I meet with an old man, bending under
the weight of time and infirmity, aud he
informs me, when l l ask him his age, that he
is 99> I reckon not only that he has lived
so many but that be hits entered into
his 100 th year; that he has paÂ£Ted through
one ceutury. and entered into 4 second.
Bring this manner of Reckoning to the
queltion before you, and you will not be
puzzled to comprehend the reason why the
leventeenth century was past, and gone with
the years before the flood, ax soon as our
fathers began to date 1700âor why, as soon
as we (hall begin to date January the ift,
1800, the eighteenth century will expire,
and the nineteenth will immediately ifTue
from the womb of time. Unlcfs we adopt'
this inode of reckoning, w e (hall inevitably
make every century rob the succeeding cen
tury of one year ; and in counting centuries,
we (hall contradict our universal rule in de
nominating our own ages. There is not
much weight in tbe objection of your cor
relponden.'s A. B. where he f 2 ys that, Â«â¢ If
the eighteenth century end with the 3 ift of
December 1799, the nineteenth century
will of course begin wi h the ift of January
1800 ; and that Ihould this be the cafe, the
firft cefttury must have cotr*Â»enced with the
ift ol January in the year o."â What would
there be strange in this ! Is not this the way
in which he computes his own age ? What
ever h;s age may bf, it rau ft have com
menced with o, with refpeft to itfelf. Nor
is thrre any danger that by this reckoning
we lhall fix the commencement of our series
. cent ' m " 'we've months before the chris
tian aera ; for if with him we Â«Â« Suppose,
that our Saviour had remained on earth un
til the 31ft of December 1799,'' and, agree
ably to our fyltem, that he was born lai.u
â¢ry the ift, in the year o, he would be cam
pletejy 1800 years old; and of ccurfe the ift
of January i'Soo will be the firft A, r
century. of

The minds of the men mud have con

" Modern Philosophy and Barbarism " 1
Is a woik which contains thoughts fuf- ]
fie." 'titly valuable to divert the eve ofcriti
cfm iron) some inaccuiacies of comp' fitioiv j
Its arguments a n- ingenious, and its sources
learned : and while we nlfent to the found- j
ness of the philosophy, we are intlru&ed by j
th- vii iues of the moralifl. He rises boldiy t
against that fvflem, wherein affedtion and f
sympathy plead in vaio the unalloyed die- j
' tales of nature ; wherein fenfi ility weeps j
unheeded ; and filial' piety is treated with ]
contempt. Such wan the system of Lycur
[ Â£US, and fueh the author has delineated to .
I be the theory of Godwin.
And he (hews, that could it be carried
into effe'l, it would be p oducllve of more (
enlarjrrd inju y and extensive evil, than the
r.ufea of Lycnrgus, fey deteriorating the j
mint of man by destroyi "g the fabric of
-civilized fooiety, by hurrying mankind
back to that (late of ignorance and barbar
ism, from which they firft set out.
He ably overthrows the principle of equa
â¢ lity by an argument of trie "ntceflity of su
bordination ;,and to which we may add the j
natural principles of moral and physical lDe-^
s quality. The mifchicf ariliiig from the other
i principle of modern philosophy, which is ge
neral ufility, is well pointed out by him.â "
Friendship, pateraal love, arid all the sublime 1
, feelings of humanity, may'thus be annihi
. lated ; because no'man should be preserved
1 but according to his ufeftilnefs. And may
. we not ask then,- since gratitude may thus '
become a vice, may not parricide become a
vintpej May I embrue my hands in the blood '
, of my ancient parent, because worn out with
years, in toil for my present and future feli
city ? What blasphemy against Nature and
. Humanity!!!
; 4 As to the argument of universal benevo
. lence, it is % a principle so vast, a circle so
r T immenft, that the mind is loft in it. The
. influence of all immediate duties cease, the
r mind becomes qui?fcent, and the man dete
. riarates. Destroy too the con trout of affcc
-1 'ions, the anarchy of- licentioufnefe ensues.
Thus man will tumble into all the brutifying
effe&s of the uncontrouled gratification of
. the passions 5 serious and fubfime refleftion
be annihilated J and theTe refined philofo
-3 phers be undiftfngulfhable from the animals
t were it not for their risible muscles and ereÂ£i
, form.
f Whoever jievufes Mt, Proby's book will
t perceive that the modern system of philoso
phy isa compound us duplicity. It pre
a tends to encreife the j towers of man, and
s narrowd thtm to felfifhnefs. It appears as
f enlightened philosophy,. while gloomy su
perstition and organized barbarism lurk be
neath. It holds out unlimited independence,
s and chains down man by the moll degrading
- (lavery. Its doarine of Universal Equality
- holds out the olive branch of peace, whillt
e the inequalities of nature mull unflieath the
e sword of war. It pretends to exalt reafoo,
v and reduces man to .mechanical motion
Strip it of its fafcinating glare of novelty,
â¢all its meritriaious ornaments, and! w c shall
behold barbaric enslaving inditutions, more
r injurious to man than those of the Spartan
Legislator. Nay, it dooms man to the -
woods, a wild savage and naked barbariau.

THOUG H I believe that health is main
â¢ tamed by a temperate ul"Â« ot the good things
of this worli, I cannot refitt the tempta
tion of relating a doty which is somewhat
contcadi^ory.
In a cause before lord chief judice Holt,
two farmers disputed i-bout way over
one of their grounds. To prove there had
been ao way formerly, a very old 15311 was ;
called, who, notv* ihtlanding his great age, j
appeared flrong and healthy. My lord, oI I
nearing him fjy lie remembered the grounds !
four score and iix years, asked him how old
he was ; ninety.Ji* replied the country
man. " Ninety fix !" cry'd my lord, in
admiration, " and so llrong and lusty ? Pray,*
peafeyou my lord (fays the old man) I
lave lived on our country fare, chiefly 011
bread, butter, milk, eggs, ard such fort.
I was never much a flelh eater, and neVer
drank a >y thing drong in my life j no, not
so much as ale. I never was overtaken in
liquor ie all my days, and was nevpr sick in
my life." The judge, furprlfed at the ac
e count, addressed himfeif to the gentlemen at
the bar, and greatly commended so rare an
' e example of temperance, and set forth what
e blessings wf health and loug life attended it.
When the witnefTes on the other fide came
e to be examined, an o;d man swore that there
had been an ancient wayoVw*r.the grounds,
- â and that he remembered it ninety-eight years
ago. Â«Â« Ninety-eight ? (fays my lord) why
how old are you >" 'â¢ C me next Shrove-tide
r> ; (replies the m.i u hrifkiy) I shall enter on
u my hundred a..d sixteenth year." " Blef,

* ' , â¢. â¢ * 4 - t>-
and, vigrwous it the other wititefs. You fee I
,f aoain, gentlemen, the effedisAf temperance. '
[ r These have never debauched or d bili- I* e
i tated nature. You, old father, hive lived!
w such another fort of a life, as yoir neigh- | , r;
n hor there." Not 1, indeed (replied the
:S old man, laughing,} No, no, he isa e(IRL
a fop, but I love good ftons ale, aid have
ie loved it from my cradle. I have draik free
:a ly all my life ; uo man ra re foin tic whole R<

j r many and many a year, without being hap
d py It is good strong drink, my lord that *
