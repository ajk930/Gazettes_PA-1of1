COMMUNICATION.
To MEDICUS.
SIK,
IF yau iiad waited with patience till I had
fiuiflied my /ketch relative to the Origin of
th; Yellow fever, which has occalioned such
mortality and diitASs of late years in this
country, I think you would have Spared your
censure, unless you are actuated by a very
litigious Spirit.
If you had intended I ffiouli have profit
ted by your advice, you would have written
in the language of a gentleman, and hive
mated me with the civility alid politer.- fs
that ought to distinguish a profolionai dia- !
rafter.
If truth and the welfare of your fellow
citizens had been your aim, Would you not'
have been more Correct in your flitements
as well as more mild in your expteffions } '
If tne lociety of young gentlemen who
stile theuilelves the Academy of Medicine,
(and who, having very little or no practice
to attend to, aiTemble frequently together I
for the laudable purpole of converfin<j toee- I
ther 011 the difficulties they meet with from
the " Scoff of Pride, from Envy's frown ana I
Poverty Ls unconquerable bar,") fay, wha
you lay for them, that the Yellow Fever may
be both generated and imported, they are
guilty of a very palpable inconliltency ; for
fa their hit letter addrefled to the Governor
they aflert, that it is not contagious in the' I
W ell- Indies ; and if that is the cafe, how
can it be imported ? Some of them go far- '
therâthey even deny its being contagious
here, in opposition to fads known to evei v
body elieâl'hey alio " deprecate, in the molt
solemn manner, the continuance of a belief
in the supposed importation of the fever, as
it has (accordingto them) led to a total neg
ligence of the proper means of preventing its
return."-â[See their letter.] J

fewer, and milder in their Symptoms, after I
paving of the streets became general, and at- !
tsr the dock was arched over, and regulations I
of general clean linef's were eltabli/hed, how I
do thole distinguished physicians., whom you I
fay mature oblervation has convmced. ; that I 1
the YelLow fever is only a higher grade ol I ,
Bilious fever, (and which the Academy 1 â 
is derived from the cih&iations ofthe gutters f
of the ftnjets) account for their having he- *
come contagious, and of having afi'umed j
fucjj an aggravated and horrible form ? for
according to eveiy principle of found reason, 1
the cautes ought to have bein aggravated, !
not mod* rated, to produce Such aggravated ']
and extraordinary elfefts.
Hut, tiie Bilious Fever does not in any t
country, like-, the \ellow Fever, after con- I -j
interruption for three or
four days, cease of a fuddtfri m thdgenerali- | !!
<y of cases, (the ffctient remaining easy and k
tranquil for ieveral hours,) and then return J t .
-with an increaie of violence and with ad- 1
ditional Symptoms ; and in cases that end fa- 1*
tally, conclude the cataitrophy with a vomit- ,
inÂ§ of matter as black as 111k. Nor dod.f- t j
feftionj dtmonftrate a mortification of tlu
ftoinach and total obitruftion of the gall
ducts in fatal Cases o{ Bilious Fever, as they I 1
do in the Yellow Fever. |J
If yoa had paid attention to what I had I , v .
pubhfhed when you undertook to prove by I w
anticipation, that I knew nosh ng aoout the I w
Subject, and might do mifchief by leffcning I w
the confidence in the effects' to be expefteu j,j
from the introduction of water into the city, J ]"
you would have perceived that I am an ad- I 1,

the propagation of contagious diseases.

Mr. Otis said, the committee to whom
was referred the hill for amending the Stamp
eat. Aft, with relpeit to the duty payable on fo
> reign bills of- exchange and bills of lading,
J J] ud received information from the CommiS
, [ lonei ' ps the Revenue, stating that it would
he necetrary to provide Some comptnSatiou
tor the Supervisors, who had the management
of the â¢stamp bufmefs, as the preSent law
provides none. The committee had alSo Sug
s gelled the propriety oS making Some other
alterations in the bill ; he therefore moved
that the committee cf the whole be discharg
ed from the farther conlideration cf this bill
with a view of having it re-committed to
the K-lect committee who reported it.
had J iIC n 'Â°' ion wwcarrie<1 ' and the bill was â¢'
re-committed', Mr. Otis afterwards made a
ucfv re P the propefed amendment? ; but
but owing to fciiK informality, the report
was not received. '
erv ' ' ,e bil ! for the enumeration of
the inhabitants of the United States, was j
fit- , tbe passed ;as was also
ten r iV reported to be due

iu tavor of its paflage.
, w . ' 1 hatcher, frotn the committee <>f re- 1
(5t widwfioilhed bulmefs, made a report
ts " 1 expiring laws, which was ordered to
' be printed.
ho r he s F ake t was proceeding to take the |
lenle of the HouSe on proceeding with the I
' unfinilhed buSmeSs of yefterdar, viz. the I I
1 Bankrupt bill ; when,
e- I â  r " w;1 " moved to postpone this Sub- '
; m " ! eft ti!l to-morrow, in order to consider tlic 1
ad I by his colleague '
at ail d this morning laid upon the deik. 1
. I Ihe motion being- agreed to,
re Mr ' Grifwo!d ca!led up for consideration 1
01 . the teSolution which he yefterelay laid upon
the table for the appointment of a committee .
ie' to Â» C Â° n " <Jer t!le propriety of amending the 1
w I A . for the puhilhment of ceruin crimes '
r I agamft the United States, So at to provide a c
penalty for any citizen who shall usurp the 1
I Executive authority of this government, by
It I jÂ° minen p' n g or carrying on, any correfpon-
,j- dcnce with government of any foreign prince 1
IÂ° r re lative to controversies or disputes, n
p which do or shall exist bitwixt Such prince or P
I date and tiie United States.
I The resolution having been read, g
is I r * c ' lo ' as he believed this to'be a
I neceflity Sor making the propoSed inquiry ; d
. I ind, if it had any particular objeA in view,
" j :he motion appeared to him premature. If 31
v t was founded upon what had been seen in k
the public papers relative to the condud of
1 certain gentleman who has lately been in
I F ranee, he thought the mover ought to have
' j 'f a 'ted until the President of the United 6
j states had put the house in possession' of vl
acls 011 this fubjeft; which, though promised 'I
j hree weeks ago, had not yet been received. a {
I Indeed, he did not know but the conduit of di
I 'his house in giving an opinion upon thefa
' JiSpatches, before they are received, had pir
â > vented the communication ; and if the houk hi
I hould proceed to leeiflate upon them, the
President may suppose they have no delire
' I i-O ice what he has proniiSed to lay before Q.
' chem, and withhold them altogether. If any
1 particular has given occasion to this
j new kind of legislation, the house ought to
I know it. He had hoped that no change had th
1 j taken place in the affairs of this country Je
with refpeft to foreign nations, which cculd
have dire died the resentments of gentlemen an
to any particular person. He had hoped s a l
things were mending, and he had gathered th
theSe hopes from the addreSs of the President ch
I it the opening of the session, as in that ad-
I Irefs, he leeoned to wish to argue down the Sei
I too Sanguine hopes of a Speedy reconciliation SÂ«r
I which might arise from the communication coi
I wlpch he had to make en the fubjeft. This f or
was not only .the impression which the address cot
I :iad made upon his mind, but it was, as far as p r <
J lie had learnt, the jreneral impression. In- fay
leed, he found a different tone even amongst
I thole gentlemen who had always been the is f
I loudefl in their cry Sor war, from what ex- not
J ifled when he last parted with them. Nothing m ai
j vas then heard, but a declaration of t'l."'
I low he heard nothing of the kind. Think- not
I ng, therefore, as he did, that the fubjeft is sen,
j )f too novel a kind for general legislation, tubi
J without fomegood reason being affignedfor ' J
I t, and that the house does not pofTefs fuffi- on
I ient information, if the measure be levelled f OU i
J it a particular objeft, he was opposed to the The
j motion.
I _.^ r * Grifwold Said, the gentleman from the
y lrginia had mistaken the objeft of this re- e rnr
I 1 olutioii, in fuppoling it had reference to a- that
ny particular peifo.n. Its obje'ft, said Mr. fc
" Is B tn eral, and I think of the Sirft im- satn
j .>ortance. I think it necefTai yto guard, by The
law, against the interference of individuals , nrr
in the negociation of our executive with the hanc
governments of foreign countries. The pre- thin
lent Situation of Europe, in his opinion, calls
aloud Sor a regulation of this kind. He did
not know but an interference of this kind '
might have already taken place ; but the ob- A
jest of this motion was profpeftive, and had decta
nothing to do with what is past. If, said oftht
Mr. G. offences of this kind are to pass im- convc
puniihed, it may be in the power of an indi- mand
vidual tofrufttate all the deSigns of the ex- th ""
ecutive. The agent of a faction, if Such a Hafo
faftionfliall exist, may be fcnt to a foreign fcri'x
country to negeciate in behalf of that sac- be pa
tion, in oppoGtion to the executive author M
ity, and will any ore Say, that Such an of- f \â¢;
fence ought not fevf-rely to be puffifhed ?It Â»p'
certainly ought. Placing the Subjeft in this d .c
trady point of vie-.':, LÂ» thougiit k lhe duty of ths
hum- Isgiaitiy* to tnqnire into it. He was not
certain that adequate prov.Uoricouldbe inade
puni'iiment of ejfcncesof thit kind,
>.v. but he w,fh: I th; matter wgoto a eomn.it
-- Â»orx^mtid?srtti o n. He hoped no occafjon

be WJ-! type prjpa.ei th meet it. He could

that the sum should be struck out, and the a,Uj
