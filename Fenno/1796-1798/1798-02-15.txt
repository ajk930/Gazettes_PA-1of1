AT a juncture when the qucftion of
a Comotarcial Treaty xvilb France may feoa
become an objeA of difcuflion, a workef this kind
becomes extremely ufefut to those eitizens of the
United States, who may be defirons to enable them
feives to view this fubjedt, under its various af
pecSts ; and they will have the fatisfadion to be
furnilhed with the necessary data, to judge of the
ufefulnefs of this tranfadlion.
This work is principally diftinguilhed by tlk
richness of the observations, the perfpitnity of the
ideas, and the modesty of the theory which it
contains. At Pars, a man of wit observed, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufetul produce. It is addref â¢
fed to the unfortunate La Fatitti, in letters,
which fugitive the author who could only
devote a few weeks to this occupation, was obliged
to adopt. Although circumftanc-s arc iu many
refpefls different at the present day, from what
thty were in the year 1790, when these letters
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so ma
ny abfolutc and permanent data (till remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lets on that account ; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
sult of the author's remarks, it will serve to con
vince hmi that in all tranfa&ions, between free
nations, ev ry thing maybe expedtedfrom the ef
fort.ef truth andjuftice.

would havealtoniDied a mete thforifl) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience." These
kinj of taUeaax, uuhlckily as difficult to obtain as
they are much to be defited, are the only fuie guides
the flatefman can take for the policy of treaiies. de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We cinnot too much admire the apparent ex
a&nefs of colonel Swan's calculations ; and although
the propbcfies of Lord Sheffield have already been
contradicted by experience, and by several able pens,
yet it is curious to fee the author of ihÂ« present work,
dispute with him the only ground on which he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proÂ»ir* that Fiance,
under the required condiiiou, will be better able
than Gieat Britain to supply us with several articles,
which the English author allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's pvtia/ity tjfetl tm (if he
has any! does not appear to have at any time created
a partiality of judgment. The result of this calculation
is that in 1789, that is to fay, at a period when arts
and maoufafUies did sot present in France the vast
means and probability of extension which they now
poff.fs. that even in 1-39, it was presumable, that

1 DIBATI ON TUI ILIfOUT Of THE COHHIIIH
or niviLto*!. â¼ ,
__ aft
MONDAY âFEBRUARY 11.
(Concludedfrom yejleriays Gazette J
Mr. Gallatiw said he ftould not hare gi.
! risen tgain on this fubjeft, if it had not cu
been to explain some things which he had drj
! before said, and which had been misrepre
sented. After explaining these Mr. G. an
went oh to (late that no aft of disorder done :
in the house ought to be noticed farther than
the decorum of the house required, as the A ,
laws were ready to take cognizance of in- mi
juries committed on members as well as on
those who are not members. He quoted the , â
constitution to ftiew that this was the inten- \el
tion of it. Indeed,. he did not believe any Â°Â°
gentleman on that floor would lay he want- ( J"
ed prote&ion; they could generally pruteft rrs
themselves ; and if not, the law would pro- Kit
test them, as it protested others. But it
was said offences vvhicji had a tendency to if- wi
turb their proceedings ought to be puuifhcsl.
This he allowed, but he would puni/h them on
in a less degree. Mr. G. referred to the
cafe which has already been mentioned of a
challenge f*nt by a member of the Senate to fei
a member of that house. That bulinefs he
said was referred ti a committee, but the
parties having written,letters of apology, ex- a Â£i
attly in the tenor with.that of Mr. Lyon, Â»>
they were deemed fufficient, yet the letter : |
of Mr. Lyon is spoken of as aggravating his (lc
crime. Mr. G. did not think that a vote
of ctnfure and a reprimand by the Speaker ai
was a flight punishment. It was said no aÂ£t
of offence had ever been committed like this
nor did he think any punishment had ever w
been inflifled by this government so severe f c
as a vote of censure by the house. Because m
the member from Vermont had not received d'
so polite an education as other gentlemen,
it was supposed this punithment would not h
greatly affedl him ; but he supposed he was r<
not wholly dead to every kind of feeling, ,
i and nnlefs he was compiled of different a ,
materials from other men, such a punish- n
ment mult be considered as a very serious one. j|
z He should, therefore vote forthe amendment f
! Mr. G. added that what Mr. Lyon had p
" said respecting the representatives of Con- J
? nefticut was fpeken of as if it made part of f,
a the charge against him ; as this was not the
ease, he thought any obfervatiens on that v
- head would be better omitted. e
Mr. Dan a condemned the wish that had j
il been expressed for pafling a silent rote upon a
this fubjeft, and particularly the conduft of j
1 thegÂ«ntleman from Maryland(Mr.S.Smith) c
- for having exprcfled such a wish. He said (
x it appeared as if gentlemen had determined a
to vote against the txpulfion of the member j
from Vermont, and were afraid of hearing ,
any thing which might convince thera they ,
r- had done wrong in so determining ; or were ,
the gentleman from Virginia, and others, ;
J ' who were so ready to speak to the public on j
other occasions, afraid to do so on this, |
from a conviftion of the weakntfs of their (
ft cause? Mr. Dana took notice of the cases (
e - stated by the gentleman frotu Pennsylvania, .
to whose manners he paid a compliment at 1
the expence of his logic. Spoke of the ne- (
cefiity of pteferving decency and dignity of
manners in all public bodie*. The member
from Vermont, he said, had been very free
in his remarks upon Connefticwt ; but to
have merited the hatred of the gentleman
from Vermont,tyas by no means difgraceful.
He should wrong the Rate of his nativity,
Ik,*' he should wrong his colleagues and-himfelf,
k. were he to undertake a formal refutation of
this calumny. The citizens of Connefticut
will disdain the idea of being enlightened by
that membÂ§r's knowledge, or of being re
: volutionized by his power, as they will re
of pel with indignation any imputation against
their representatives in Congressârepresen
tatives who were born and educated amongst
i!d ' them, and Â«vhom, in consequence of their
j- good opinion of them, they have appoint
ee ed by their unsolicited fuffrages, to do their
or national business. Hadthe aflertion no other
,th currency than the member from Vermont's
'j| word, he should not. have noticed it; but as
he it appeared upon thf journals, and had goÂ«e
cu out to the world, he thought it necefTary
ch to fay what he had said on this fubjeft. But
for these calumnies, it was probable, he said
that the outrage on Mr. Grifwold would
not have been committed? but what could
- be a more serious charge against another,
than to be told "you have betrayed your trufi f"
This was what gave all the keenness to the
epithet of co-ward, when applied to au offi
cer. Mr. D. said he did not mean to cast
any blame upon gentlemen who differed
from him in opinion; noj would he envy a
ny gentlemen the plcafure they would have
in the company of the gentleman from Ver-
Y. Mont ; if they chufe to afTociate with such
a Kctmeil of Filth, let them do so ; let them
prtfs him to their heart, and salute him as
e ' their brotherâthey may do it without envy.
ro ' Let them be delignated as the companions
F f ' of Mr. Lyon, by being pointed at, by
" There gtet the number of Congress, <who
r , h voted to have Matthew Lyon as a companion !''
, If they felt themselves invulnerable to such
a reproach, lie acknowledged he had not at
tained to their degree of infenfibilfty. He
â  himfelf would put him away, as citizens re
'" moved impurities and filth from their docks
t -and wharves.
et, Mr. S. Smith thought, as he had deter
ien, mined to fay nothing upon this fubjeft, that
icis, he should not have received the censure of
Â®* <l any cne. He had conversed with several
ir " gentlemen on both fides the quettion, and
an y he t&ought, in order to avoid a lengthy dif-
H cufTion, which could have no effeft but pro-
duce heat, it would be belt to take a silent
vote on tlx question. % The gentleman just
rn ' down had called upon him as a military man.
'â¢ He did not come here as a military man,
Â°' but as a IrgilLtor. It frerrid as if gentle
men were determined l* Bake him fpcrkoa
tkiÂ» fiibjeft ; if he Isnd '.vifhed tÂ« do so they J aft
would uÂ«t have been able to have kept hiAi me
silent. He thought the gentleman last up me
had made a speech to little purpose. If co
military opinions were wanted t two milita- ioj
ry genthmeo had already given their opin
ions. If twenty years ago, lie had been bil
asked an opinion, he fnppofed he should ad
have givenfnch a one as the gentleman from re;
â¢onnefticut/ would not have liked to hear.
Mr. Dana did not <wijh the gentleman to be
give his opinion, and hoped he would ex- tei
cufe him for having given his, though he ta
drftred him not to do it.
The queftioH on the amendment was put cc
and negatived, 5* to 44. til
mis sorry to detain the" Committer th
one mnmÂ«ni; btntfrom hi* peculiar si nation, he con
cciwifi 11 prope^to exprc'fs the motives of his ctipÂ»duÂ£V.
Ai the co.league of ttte member Irom VcnwtU, it "t!
might be e*pccled from the community ot interells m
between the two diftritl* thhey reprcfiented. that he
(bould endeavor to support Ihn member. But, fir, I
l:Â«\e attended with much pain and patience to tuc iÂ»Â»- t>
\elhgation this fubji& has undergone, and, fir, not a ft
doubt remains on my mind that the member from j-j
VeriroHt haabcen guilty of grpfs indecency arid infuit aj .
to this hf.u'c, 1 hav# not a doubt, fir. that tin; pow
ers veftcd in the House of Representatives b\ the Con-
Hitution are amply fuHicieni to punish such indecency tfl
Â«ud such tr.fuit ; and that the resolution now on the Jp
table prescribe* ihe oxily puhiiViir.ent commtnfura t
wi h the < ffence. *
It become* me, Sir, to*!make this publie dechrati- tr
on of my lentitnenis, as a dut\ which I owe to this q|
âaduylovte my constituents âthe conft<tu-
enti of the < ffenoing mcntbe and myfelf. For lam .
peiluaded, fir, that tiieciuxena ol Vermont wou d re
sent any conduft ot iheir Representative so derogatory tc
to tac honor and dignity of Congress, and their own
charader. j.
The member from Vermont has violated the char- '
aftei and Â«onfidence vefisd in bun by b,s conttutfenu; tr
and the re o'unon to pafÂ»-âtliat they may ex- w
heir diiapprobatinn ot his fc'ondÂ»-61, by w
ing another psnon to^firiâ¢ thai Uat. JFiom their con- i -
fidtra'ions, he (hould resolution his-fupjÂ»on, * L
j The question on the resolution was put p
and carried, 51 to 43,
The committee then rofc, and reported P
I the amendment to the resolution, together ci
with the evidence which had been taken be- b
I fore them. The house took up the amend- n
ment (relative to the offenlive words iu the t(
I defence) and agreed tu it, 49 to 46. n
Mr. R. Williams then renewed his a- tl
mendment, for confining the punifhtnent to c
I reprimand.
I â¢ Mr. Brooks hoped if the house did not H
I agree to the bigheft punifhnient, they would 11
I not agree to the lowcft which they could f j
I inflict. He did sot fuppsfe the member v
from-Vermont would look upon this as a 1
I punishment ; and if no other was to be or- t
I dered, the house wouldlget >id of his of- 1
fences.
1 Mr. Macon said it was observable there 1
I were two opinions in the house ; one for l
I expulsion, the other for a reprimand. He (
I did not think the offence was such as would (
I authorise an expulfian. He said there had *
I been as many illiberal expreffiont in the 1
I course of this dehate as he had ever heard-.
I Gentlemen had talked of party doing this, !
I and party doing the other,whilft they them- |
I felvet are the firft to mention it. He bop-
I e<Hhey would have kept these things out of '
I the fight of the world. If gentlemen of '
I one description voted one way ; those of 1
' I another, voted a contrary way. As for the 1
I punishment of being reprimanded in the 1
1 I face of the house, which would be entered
I onthe journals, hethought it a very serious '
' I one, and he would almost as soon be hanged '
1 j at once. He hoped, therefore, the punish
' I ment would be thought at least equal to
' I the offence.
1 I The question wu now taken, at heretofbie ftaied.
WEDNESDAYâFEBRUARY 14.
: I Mr. Otis, from the committee to whom
5 I was referred that part of the speech of the
1 I President of the United States, which relates
* I to the re-imburfement of certain advances
> I made by Consuls in foreign countries, made
Â» I a report, stating that it was supposed 30,000
f I dollars would be fufficient for this objeft,
1 and recommended the adoption of a refolu-
Y tion for effeftiÂ»g the measure, which was
- I committed for Fiiday.
Mr. Harper, from the of ways
* I and means, who had been inflrufted to en
- quire whether any and what alterations are
I I necessary in the law refpefting the entry of
r j Stills, was direfted to make a report on the
* I fubjeft. The report was accompanied by a
r I bill making an alteration in the manner of
r making the entry of Stilli, by doing away
8 the annual entry after the firft of July next,
8 I and requiring that after a Still has been once
e I entered, it shall be again entered only in cafe
Y I of removal.âThis report and bill were com
-1 I mitted for Monday.
I The fame gentleman, from the fame com-
J I mittee, to whom it had been referred to en
d I quire whether any and what alterations at)e
'â¢ I necessary in the aft laying a duty on stamped
I vellum, parchment and paper, was direfted
, e I to make a further report, recommending
I thae a deduftion of 7$ per cent, should bÂ«
I allowed to all pMrchafes of stamps (except
d J colleftors of revenue) above the value of
l " I twenty dollars, and that a certain deduftion
c I should be retained by the colleftors of the
r * I impost duty, from drawbacks on goods ex
h I ported, instead of the stamp duty proposed
n I to be laid, which it was dated would fall Ve
ls I ry unequally, according to the feale propo
'â¢ fed in the law. A bill was reported at the
1S fame time making these alterations in the
y law.âThe report and bill were committed
I for Monday.
Mr. Sitgreaves presented the application
h of John Parker, for printing the Jeurnals
t_ of the Old Congress, stating the terms up
on which he meant to undertake the work. !
c " Referred to the committee to whom hasbeen
II referred a reftJution on this fubjeft.
Mr. D. Foster from the committee of
r- claims to whoft was re-committed the report
at on the petition of Henry Hill, made a long
Â»f report on this fubjeft, which was commit
â al ted for Monday.
id The bill making appropriations for the
if- support of Government for the year 1798,
0- and for Â®ther. purposes, was read the third
nt time and passed.
aft Mr. Harper proposed to add the follow.
in. ing regulation to the Standing Rule* and
in, Orders of the House, viz.
le- " Resolved that the Standing rules and
oa Order! of the house be amended by ioferting
after rules refpefting motions for adjourn
ment, provided that nd motion for adjourn- tl
Vient (hall be received, except by Unanimous bi
consent, whillt any other mouion iÂ» pend
ing." Ordered to lie on the table,
The amendments of the Senate to the rÂ«
hill for the relief of the Refugees from Can- si
ada and Nova-Scotia, were taken up and a
referred to a Seleft Committee. P
The bill from the Senate for sale of land e<
between the Great and Little Miami in the ri
north weft of the Ohio, was also o
taken up and committed for Monday. Vl
Mr. Nicholas wished, as in some degree
coanefted with the fubjeft, to present ape- b
tition from a number ot persons fettled near w
the mouth of the Kentucky river, who ft
wiflied to purchase the fame, which would â¢
be proper to fce referred to the fame com- Â°
mittee. He wished also to move an instruct:
tien to the committee, to enquire what pro- o
grefs has been made in carrying the ail into
effeft for the sale of land north weft of the y
river Ohio, and whether any amendments J
arc necessary in the said aft, particularly as
to the price of the land. Mr. N. believed 11
there was little probability of the land fell- F
ing at the price which had been fixed, and f
persons who might become purchasers, if a
the price was reasonable, were now moving r
off to the Spanish Territory. He thought *
ft would be well to prevent this, and there- _
fore moved this inltruftion.âlt was agreed
to.
Mr. Sitgreaves moved the order of the
day on the report of a feleft committee on
the memorial of the people called quakers;
which motion being agreed to, the house
went into a committee of the whole on the
fubjeftj. Mr. Dent in the chair. The re
port having been read,
Mr. Thatcher could not fay that he was f
perfeftly fatisfied with the report of the '
committee in all its parts. He wiflied the j 1
business dffpofed of, without coming to a- j
ny deo'five resolution upon it, so as either j
to approve or disapprove of it. He W3S ,
not ready to fay that the fafts disclosed in
that memorial were exclufively'of judicial
cognizance, and that the legislature of the <
Union wa3 incompetent to do any thing iir â¢
it. It might, however be true, but it was (
not clear to him. He would rather that the
fubjeft "should not now be a&ed upon : he ,
would, therefore, propose an amendment
to the report, which might conclude the j
business, without coming to any resolution
upon it, which had been the course hereto
fore taken with similar applications. He
moved, therefore, to strike out the resolu
tion giving the petitioners leave to withdraw
their petition ; and if his motion was agreed
to, he should wiftr the committee to rife,
and that the house would not aft further
upon it at present.
Mr." Rutledgc said, he, as well as the
gentleman from Massachusetts, was diffatis
fied with the report of the feleft committee.
He thought the report ought to have ftat
r ed that the peace of certain states in the U
p nicn had been much disturbed by applies
f tions of jhis kind. He had prepared a re
. solution to this effeft, which he would read
, in hit place : It was as follows :
i " Resolved, that part of the material of
5 the people called Shaken, has a tendency to d'if
j turb the tranquility of some of the slates of the
Union ; that thit house is not eompetent to aO
} upon, and therefore they have leave to with
draw their memorial."
There could be little difference of opin
ion on the assertion that the internal tran
j quility of several states had been disturbed
e by these applications ; and he believed there
, would be no difficulty in obtaining a major
-3 ity, of the house to declare it-j as if the re
e prefentatives of three or four states were to
3 rife and declare the faft it must have fuffi
t cient weight to carry a declaration of this
- kind. He had, however, mentioned the
s natter to some of his friends, and found it
was not very agreeable to them, as they
swished to get rid of the business without
- debate. But if the present motion were to
e obtain he should afterwards bring forward
,f this resolution.
e [The Chairman declared the motion of
a the gentleman from Maffachnfetts to bÂ« out
,f of older.]
y The question on the resolution as report
y ed was put and carried, there being 74 votes
c in the affirmative. The committee then rose,
" e and the house concurred in the report.
On motion of Mr. Gregg, the unfinifc
ed business of yesterday (the bill for the re
-- lief of O. Pollock) was postponed till Mon
ye Mr. Coit called for the reading of the
d petition of Anna Welfli; which having been
d read, he proposed the following resolution
g for adoption:
l 8 " Resolved on the petition of AnnaWelfh
>t that a committee be appointed to bring in
>f a bill for allowing the legal reprefentativea
in of George Hurlburt, deceased, late a cap
ie tain in the fervic* of the United States, the
k- commutation of half pay which was due to
:d him."
e- After a few observations, this motion was
0- negatived, 50 to 31, the question having
*e been decided iu an abftraft manner, when
ic the business was before thfc hoafc some time
:d agÂ°i the period of war was at
tempted to be fixed earlier than it had been
in heretofore considered to have been, in order
lis to take in the of persons who died be
p. fore the latter period. It was determined
k. also that the prayer of this petition could
en not be granted.
Mr. Livingfton called up the report of
the committee of commerce and manufac
,rt tures on the petitions of William Dixon,
n S John Bagl'ey, and others, which was con
ll* curred in, so far as it related to William
Dixon and John Bagley.
On motion ef Mr. Thatcher, the house
went into a committee of the whole on the
bill granting the right of franking to the
w Attorney General.
nd Mr. Harper moved to amend the bill by
adding "and the officer commanding the
nd troops of the United States which was a
ng greed to.
The committee rose, the house agreed tÂ»
the and the bill was ordered tÂ»
be eugroffed ror a third reading.
On motion of Mr. Gregg, the house
went into a committee of the whole on the
report of the committee of claims on the
fubje&of making prevision for thp widow*
and or phan children of the officers of the
army of the United States, who were kill
ed in an adlion with the Indians, in the ter
ritory north-weft of the Ohio, on the
of November, 1791. The report was fa
vorable.
Mr. Davis moved to amend the report,
by adding Jlfilitia Officers. He thought it
was only reasonable, that an allowance
fhonld be made to the widows and orphans
â¢f militia officer*, as well as to those of the
officers of the army. The Kentucky mili
tia were out on that expedition, JKid federal
officers were killed.
Mr. D. Foster proposed to make the pro
vision general, ami to go back to the 4th of
MÂ«rch 1789.
Some objeftioÃs were urged to thisamend
ment, as it was apprehended, from its cam
prehenfivenefs, it might endanger the pasÂ»
sage of the bill, as the Senate had rejefted
a former bill of this kind. The committee

had leave to fit agjiiii. Adjourned.
PHILADELPHIA,
THURSDAY EVENING, FEBRUARY 15;
For the Gazette of the United States.
MX. FINNS, t .
As it is said the elaia of certain creditors
for payment of bills which were endorfcd by the
United Stater, and lodged id the Treasury agree
ably ro the aifl for limiting claim* will soon come
before congress, you are requested to publish the
following report of the Secretary ot the Trea
sury upon the fubjeiftâwhich has never been
adled upon.
" The certiScates or bills of credit called new
emission money were emitted pursuant to a refe-*
lution of congress of the 18th March 1780,
which dircfts ihem to be emitted upon the funds
of individuals states, to bear an interest of five
per Â«entum per annum, payable in the
redemption of thebills, or at the e'eflion of the
holder, annually at the continental lean offices, in
Jierl.ng bills drawn by the United Stares upon
their commissioners in Europe, and pledges the
faith of the United States lor the payment of
the said bills, in ease any Jtate tn whafe funds
theyjkould be emitted Jhould by the events of rjsar
be rendered incapable to redeem them ; directing
also aa endorsement to be made on each till in
tbefe words " The United States insure the pay
ment of she within bill and will draw bills of
exchange for the interest annually if demanded,
according to a resolution of congress of the 18th
of March 1 fto."
These resolutions and the endorsement upon
the bills engage the promife of the U
nitrd States for the payment of the interest in
definitely, and their eventual guarantee of the
principal, in cafe any fla'es on whnfe
funds the bills should be emitted (hould by the'
â¢verts of war be rendered incapable to redeem
them<; âwhich is in tftd, though not in form>
an abfolnte guarantee of the principal ; for the
United Statts are bound t'.- ppy the intertft ptr
r pet Haltj nil that is discharged.
Good faith demasda that the United States
, fliould supply the omiiTions of the Rates which
I iflued the bills, by providing themfelves,atleaft
for th* interest upon them. _
But it is not as eaiy to pronounce on whtt
terms they outfit to be provided for.
On their face, and according to the unrevoke
ed resolutions of congress, they are of specie
[ value equal to their nominal amount and bear
ing five-per cent interest.
But it is kcown, thaj they were ifued by dif
ferent states at different inferior values fixed by
previous laws'
1 The true nature of the contrail therefore, in
â  faS, and the true equity of the cafe, are from
1 these circumstances involved iti fonne question,
A compromise by a new agreement seems the
best road out of the difficulty.
This iÂ» the aim Â«f the propofition.-f' which it
r is hoped will in the main reasonably consult all
' intereils
) There have been fpeeial references of this
1 fubjedl to the Secretary ; but he purposely de
clined a report till the expiration of the tern
Â£ limited by the ail entitled' "An a& relative to
claims against ihe United States not barred by\
any a&aflimitation & which havÂ® not been alrea
dy adjufled" gaffed the 11th of February 1793,
bad obviated a danger to which the business was
s txpeled :âlt is now ascertained that the amount
, for which the United States shall be in future
liable is ninety thousand five hundred andfeven
ty-four dollars. The sums fubferibed to the
loan, will of course be a charge against the
states which refpeAivelyifiucd the biils."
* This appears to be a ntijlake, as upon enqui
rj it cannot be found that any eft he fates did pass
* such previous laws : It may be presumed they did
n not ; to put such bills of credit, and upon inter
-1 eft, into circulation, and at the fame time or pre
vioufiy to pass a lam to impair the obligation to
pay them, would have been -viewed by atl men
as an nfl of perfidy and fraudâTh refore, it
Q ' will not be fuppefed that any of the fates ever
1 puffed any fueh previous aas ; or that if such
- afli had been passed, the United States mould bt
e influenced by them, or tfny other fubterfugs, to de
-0 viate from a national engagement.

MR. FENNO,
â I Some time ago observed in your Ga

j who this Democrat could be that was fÂ»

From the following cireuraftantial evi
j. dence I conclude that it certainly mfuft be
Do&or L n from the name of his lady
,c being mentioned in the letterâfrom the at
le tention ciuzen Monroe received from him
immediately on hiitipival. It is well known
>y that the Ddttor bragged ot the honnr he

bonrhood about that time, ihatlthe Doctor j _

rot mentioned. I (hould not_ have noticed
these circumftanrfi at the time, Ind the,
Doftor remained quietâbut his turning out m
for the purpose of eleftionecring, not in his l
own neighbourhood (bis popularity there iÂ«, t ]
and T' hope ever will be at an end) but in
Delaware county, where he has been very
busy, in recommending Israel as a true dif- t ;

renders it proper that his political chara&er Q
(hould be better known than it isâthis can- f e
not be effefted in any better way than by re- ; n
ferring tofafts. It is notorious that altho' n ,
he was so full of fight before, that when f e
ealled onby thecounty troop of horse,( which hi
he then commanded) who had like true pa
triots voluntarily offered their ferrice to gov- ft
eminent against the Wcllern Infurgants, he g
was obliged to relign his command and found q
it very convenient to take refuge in a fitter ai
state from the just resentment of an enragsd 0
people who he had endeavoured to miflcad w
by seditious publications entitled " Obfer- a

Before the house was called to order, Mr. 1 1
Grifwold came into the hall and took his T 1

ing a letter when Mr. Lyon, who had
not before appeared since ht finifiied his de
fence, came into the hall with a cane in his '
hand also, and took his feat, the houf< not
being yet called to order. He placed his
stick beside his chair or behind it, and be
gan to write or to look at papers. Mr. mi
Grifwold perceiving him, teok up his stick, la'
advanced towards him in front, from the el<
oppefite fide of the house, and struck him hi
with the stick. Mr. Lyon either immedi- E
ately Â«n receiving the blow, #r immediate- da
ly before, rose, advanced towards Mr.
Gr fwold and endeavoured to close in with R
him. This Mr. Grifwold avoided, and
repeated the blow nine or tea times, > n
striking sometimes on the head and some- IS
times on the shoulders. At length they hi
closed, and Mr. Lyon was thrown by Mr. P 1

Fellow-Citizens, ,tlt 1
After a full and fair investigation in the j
mode pointed out by our constitution and
laws, Mr. Israel has been declared as unduly f orc
eleflrd a member of the State Senate ; and law:
his feat being accordingly vacated, anew of f<
EleSion is to be htrld for a Senator, on Thurf- f'"" H
day the 22d instant.
The Candidates propafed, are Benjamin .
R. Morgan, and the fa id Mr. Israel. lO 'l,
Compan'fons are sometimes considered as
invidious, but surely. when important business
is to be tranfa&ed, we ought to employ F
him Kvha is the mojl capable ; and no man will
pretend to fay, that on the score of gener- 1
al information, talents, and legislative expe
rience, Mr. Morgan has not greatly the ad- e .'
vantage. ' e,v
Mr. Morgan's private cbara&er is equal f"ff
to his talents ; and his mind not being pot-
foned by French politics, but strongly inclin- ' lav
ed to peace, and firmly attached to our pre- aci
sent happy government ; he wishes his coua- He
try to b'e independent, and free from foreign
injlucnte. rne '
The right of Eleftion is one of the most 'he
important duties that can be exercised by

' , that meeting know the principles on which tro
that feat was deelared to be vacant? If you w h
I do, you have a degree of boldness unparal- fitii
leled when you fay that they do not consist re q
with those of equal liberty. The best a- pl t
pology we can make for yÂ«u is to suppose fori
you wholly ignorant of the merit of that' thi
decision. Let me tell yoa the committee hei
determined that, every foreigner of good </Â«
oharaSer, who had shaken off his. allegfance

fuffered men wholÂ« eharafters were un- m i

one whose private have brought 0 f
him here, or whose public 'crimes have driv- th
en him from his own country shall the mo- ou
taent he touches the foil of America possess -F:
the power of legislating upon she rights of so

security? Are these your principles of equal jft
liberty? If they are, I abominate them.â ju

A CORRESPONDENT. fa
MR. FENNO, fc
At this period of absurdities, of a truth a
may it be said, that a manknoweth not him- al
felt. I thought -myfelf a republican, and n
exulted iu the thought of holding every, w
essential privilege incident to the chara&er o
of a free citizen. I have always deemed
fubmidon to the 1 laws, and ac<}uiefcence in u
the decisions of the constituted authorities, c
t jj to whom I had chosen to delegate accordant v
un powers, amongst the prime attributes of re- b
publicanifm. I have deemed italfo my dub
ty on all occasions, peaoeably to prive in my t
vote for chara&ers recommended h T talents f
I and integrity of life, as public officers, with- 0
out attempting to inveigle my neighbor in- c
to the peculiar current of my own politics, c
, 3gainft the contrary conviftions of his rea
son, judgment, dr understanding. Thus t
profrffingâthus praftifingâl oerily believ â¢ t
ed myfelf walking in the path of republican- /
ism. But a new practice (founded on pro- ' r
fejftons of more perfeft purity and patuot- j i
ism) has got into vogue, and claiming to \ c
be al(o Republican. The Republicans af-'t
ter the new form, revile their own delegates, 1
en. a nd oppose 'heir decisions. Either these . I
men are hypocritical pretender*, or I am I
no Republican. If their conduct is Re- I
publican, I can only fay that Republican- <
ism is fall going down to the (hades, and 1
Us must ere lorg find refuge only in Hell or in i
ill France. ( 1

A correfpondunt who was in the house at
the moment of decision on the question rc
fpe&ing the gross indecency of Lyon ob
fetves, that if the minority had possessed
fufficicot spirits to raise their hanging heads
and down cast eyes, their confufion would
have been much iacVeafed,by a view of the
faces in the mod crowded gallery everfcen. i
Here contempt and indignatiot) were depict
ed in every feature of taen feeling the tor
menting disgrace now indelibly attached to
the name of their country.
ExtraCl from the Vermont Gdzette.
To those whoaredazled with the brillian
cy ,of French comjuefts, and still confider
that country as the only af/lum of una
dulterated liberty ;"who can clearly discover
that the cause of freedom is promoted, by
the conversion of Europe into oge vast scene
of blood, and by the subjugation of Holland
! Italy and Spain, under the â¢dominion of
Franee ? who still have faith to believe, that
the overthrow of all social, political and
' moral eftahlifhments, without any substitu
tion, except military force, in their stead,
, will increase the happiness of society Sto
those who can consider the de-moralizing
1 and dif-adjufting policy, which has of late
charafterized the French revolution, as in
trsductoryto a millennium in politics; and
who can contemplate the unparalleled requi
sitions of their Buonapartes, as the modest
requests of the a|K>ftles of liberty j to Peo
ple who have fentimcnts like these, the late
british viflory overthe dutch, orindeed any
thing which may tend to check France in
her mad career of devastation, mujl be matter
deep regret.
But to persons who have been attentive
and impartial' obfervcrs of the important
train of events, disclosed upon the politfcal
theatre for three years pall ; and have been
able so difcern,through the envious fa&ious
and changes in the revolution, one predo
minant character, that of an ungovernable
ambition j who have beheld with astonish
ment and concern the total difjdj'iftment
of the political ballance in Europe, and the
confequeiit danger of a complete ftibverSon
of fogial order thoughout the universe ; to
those who have a just and feeling sense of
our own critical situation with refpe& to
France, and who believe that a reverfr of
fortune in the war, would operate much more
powerfully in producing a comprumife of ex
isting difficulties than the most indubitable
jufticr, or manifeft right ; to those whose
reflexions have been tbus, the late vidlory
of the English, and every other event which
will likely diminish the exorbitant power of
i the " terrible republic " must be matter of un
feigned joy.
As to the enslaved Bitavians, I am filled
with sorrow, that any thing fhouldj happen,
which will add to their accumulated misfor
-1 tunes: Happy would it be, ifinftead of lup.
porting the arm by which they are borne
' down, they would exert their power, in
â  throwing off that despotism under which
- they groan.
i When in ancient hillory I travel though
the viftorious course of Alexander and Ce
far, my feelings elevated by the heroism and
splendor of their aftions almost make me
forget the evils they produced ; but upon
1 a moment's reflexionsâl sincerely rejoice
- at any event whiah flopped their career in
i mifchief and folly. Just so my feelings are
r- with refpeft to the Cefars and Alexanders
r of France.
d To fee a nation impelled to arms, by the
n unholy fire of Jacobinism, proceeding on
1, conquering and to conquer, prostrating go
t vernmenti, ana! begetting new republics,
by the generative influence of powder and
t- ball; may afford a thoughtlefsgratification
y to minds enamoured of novel and wonder
is ful tranfaftionÂ», But to persons susceptible
1- of ferieus reflections, and who look at th/
1- consequences of afhons it will be a melan
i, choly conlideration.
i- Must we never be permitted .to declare
is truth, because we once thought France con
r- tending for liberty? Is there a Papalfatu
i- tity and infallibility attached to the French
0- | revolution, and may it no longer be exam
t- j ined? People ought not longer to be de
:o i ceived by a name. I can fay mith others,
f- ' that the French fight bravely, atchicve fa

filled the fliip with water, so that we were
obliged to get on her bottom to save our

her masts by the board, and ihtn she right
ed. The sea made a fair breach fore and
aft, and washed every thisg out of her cab
in. Our only place of fafety then was in
the bows, expeding every moment to be
washed from the wreck. The 21 ft Nov.
, we got her pumped out, and for five dava
we were without water or provifious, when
we got at foffit beef and bread that was foa

?Â« tbefe ivh& have read this curious an J valuable work,
it wilt need no recommen kitionâthey ixoiu its solid merit
âbut as it has hitherto got into very few bunds in this <
country, it will mt be amiss to ohferite âso great was the
approbation and demand in I. onion, that it paffld through
three hrge eJitio/u iu theâ¢ course of twelve months. As a
detail of tbv ingenious varieties of fraud, that endanger
pnperty in London, auJ mvfl other overgrown and opulent

as well as infiruflion ; hut as the author traces all tbefe

five Perufiil.
To ajfift the legijlator and the magifirate in the humane
cjji.e* of preventing crimes, and their oonfequent punifv
