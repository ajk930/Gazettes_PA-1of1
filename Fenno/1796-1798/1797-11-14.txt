TO THE PUBLIC. - ti
f Concluded from Thurf lay's Gaz.) i:
Dr. Currie goes on to state the following n
gross tn.iCi eprefentation from popular report : o
" That his mind was elevated to a state h
of enthusiasm bordering on phrenzy, I had a
frequent opportunity of obftrvingâand I ' g
IwVe heard from popular report, that in pas- a
sing through Ktnftngton one day with his a
black man on the feat of his chaise along (ide f
of him, he cried out with vodiTerjtioD,, ,1
u bleed and purge all Kensington ! drive on t
boy." r 1
As the Dr. has not given uÂ» a single in- <
stance in proof of his afiertion of the ele- i
vation of Dr. Ruth's, mind " to a state of 1
enthusiasm bordering on phrenzy", I must i
be permitted to ioak upon it as the creature
ofhisowrt fertile imagination.
In many Â«of the vilits which Dr. Rufli ,
made to Kensington in the year, 1793, I ac- j
companied him. In one of those vilits, (in :
which I- Vvas with him,) he was requested
by a gentleman in Kensington to attend a
number of poor families in his neighbour
hood. The Dr. excused himfelf, 011 account .
fef his numerous engagements ; upon being :
urged .a second time to vifit'them, he requell- |
ed the gentleman to bleed and purge them 1
according to the printed direction* ; and j
added in a jocular manner, that he might
apply that advice to, the whole villageâ
There was nothing extravagant in the doc
tor's manner upon this occasion. I much
doubt if â¢ the gentleman to whom the ad
vice was given, has any rccolleftiCn of
it ; nor would it haÂ»e ever been known, had
not Dr. R. upon his return to town men
tioned it to his pupils, by way of imprefling
upon them, the fimplicityÂ«nd ujuftmiVity of
the practise which experience proved to be
proper 111 the Jilcafc.
Did.Dr. introducing thit, artd
other malevolent stories against Dr. Ra mean
to " determine die <jueiliÂ«n, whether, Dr.
R. is entitled or not, to the credit of the im
portant discoveries in the healing art, to
which he is said to lay claim, &Â£.' - Dr.
Currie has told the world iji his declaration
on the 20th of Oftober, that the " inviolable
regard" he Uad for truth, was his motive
for publishing his account of Dr. R's con
duct in 1.793â -and yet h ut aew days have
elapsed fiuce he told Dr. Mease " that he
recant to do Dt.R. no harm by it, but in
tended it only as news-paper fun."
Dr. Currie proceeds thus
" Dr. W. he said was an afTaffin) because
he exprelled fomc doubts of the superior ef
ficacy of mercurial purges to those Â»f a less
drallic kind.
" Tn his letter to Dr, Rodgers, after treat
ing theepiaions of all his fellow practitioners
with the most insulting contempt, and- de
claring that he believes himfelf the unwor
thy inftrumeiit in tbe hands of a kind pro
vidence 0/ recovering more than 99 of an
hundred patients, he adds, ".it was extreme
ly unfortunate that the new remedies were
ever connefted with.'my name," and that he
claimed, no other merit thiinthatot having
early adopted and extended a mode of treat
ing the dilorder which he,had learned from
â  tis firft preceptor in medicine Dr. Redman,
and which is strongly recommended by Hil
lary, MoMy, Mitchel, Kirby, and <nany
other writers on the fever.
" The doftor certainly intended to write
a romance, for there is no mention in any
of the authors he refers to of mercurial pur
ges, or of resting ths cure of the disease 011
copious bleeding and puVging, or that God
had blefted copious bleeding and purging in
their hands, as any person that can read may
fatisfy himfelf. Mofely indeed depends
rtiuch on copious bleeding in cases where the
inflammatory symptoms arc manifeft, but all
the reft inculcate sparing and the
most mild purges. The recolleftio'n of these
things were not to his purpose, hence the
- convenience of having a good memory
forgetting what would prove obstacles to our
fchrmesâAM good democrats acquire this
kind of memory."
I have Dr. Rush's authority to that
he ever used the epithet of a (Tallin in speak
ing of Dr. Wiftar. Upon reading Dr,
Wiftar's publication, Dr. R. expressed his
furprifeby quoting the following lines from
Shakespeare.
" This was the most unkingeft cut of all;
11 F or Brutus as you know was Csefar's angel."
The words were as exprcflive of ancient
friendfhip and esteem, as they were ofafup
pofed aft of unkindnef3. Dr. Rush means
to lay the that pafled be
' tween him and Dr. W. in 1793, before the
public in which it will appear that no in
jury was done, or intended to be done, to
Dr. W.
I have already noticed Dr. letter
to Dr. Rodgers. All that I have to fay up
on the extraft which Dr. C. has here intro
duced, is that he has evinced a considerable
ft,are of malevolence by notfnifhing the sen
tence ; which would ha.ve considerably al
tered the appearance of the paragraph which
he has animadverted on. _ _
â¢ Dr. R. expressly fays, after mentioning
that he had early adopted and extended
a mode of treating the disorder, kc."âÂ«Â«ln
my firft address to the public, I acknowledg
ed that I received the firtt hints of the fafe
ty and efficacy of jalap and mercury in this
disorder in the military hospitals in the year
1777, '*â  &c. Any person less disposed to
misrepresent than Dr. C. appears to be,
would at once have perceived that Dr. R.
never meant to fay that he learnt the use of
mercurial purges from the gentlemen he lias
named.
I ftiall in this place re fume my obferva
tioos up"" f O " OW ' D ? paragraph in Dr.
Currie's pieee, refpefting blood-letting â
Â«He rtmensbsved to forget to mention.
that he adopted hisfangutiiary code slot from tt
Draco but from Mofely, who wan a mere em- ai
pir)c that praftifed in Jamaica ibme years ft
ago." ii
With what face does Dr. Currie dare to f]
speak of blood-letting in such opprobrious -
language, after telling the public, that he Â«'
Had lately drawn from 90 to 100 ounces r
of the " vital fluid" from two of his pa- e
tients in the yellow fever, at 9 and 11 bleed- fc
ings ? What epithet is bad enough for the f
man who dares to make lliefe observations e
on blood-letting after the tetms employed in c
hisfecond pamphlet torecommeiid it. Thefe f c
, are his wordsâp. 40.41. " Blood-letting 1
' general y afforded relief in all cases, when the t
â¢ aftivity of the arterial fyiletn was evident } j
> and the head and epigastrium were as the ]
: fame time much iffeftm], ; and this opera- ]
, tion was found serviceable tuhcn repeated eve- I 1

hoursaftertheeftablifhmcnt of the paroxpr fm; j
- and in every fub/eijiicnt exacerbation so long
- as thqfe fymptonls continued in any eonlide
f rable degree. To those who condemn bleed- 1
t ing under such circumstances, we may fay ]
e with Sydenham, when,, speaking of the
plague, " they either did not! bleed early
1 ' enough, or too sparingly."
- j In calling so refpettable an-author as Dr.
a i Mofely, a " mere empirif"-âDr. Currie un
i fortunately " remembered te forget'' (to
a use his favorite borrowed expressions)
w the terms which he has himfelf used in
t speaking of that gentleman's praftice ih the
r j yellow fever. " Blane and Jackfor. have
.. ! given a more accurate description of the
n ' disease ; but Mofely certainly underjlood its
d I nature und treatment better than either, though
t he may perhaps sometimes have carried his
_ plan too far for the constitutions of the ge
nerality of citizens."âSge his 2d pamphlet,
h p. 60.âHe has " remembered to forget"
I. that he has quoted him as an authority sin a
if letter signed by him and Dr. Cathralf, which
d appeared in the American Daily Adverjifer
i- of December 20th, 1793. He has " re
g- membered to forget," in bestowing theiepi
,f thet of cmpirit, his own entry into Philadel
e phia by handbills palled on the corners of
our streets, and other public places of our
d city. He has " remembered to forget"
n that Dr. Mofely flands high in his profeffion
in the city of London', and that he has op
1. posed those from whom he differed in his
o history and treatment of the yellow feverâ
r. not anonytnouflyâbut with his own name ;
n âscot in a viodiftive, malevolent style, but
le like a gentleman ; ânot from a desire to find
â e fault, but from a desire of bringing truth to
1- light.
e Dr. Currie proceeds thus "He also, in
ic a most extraordinary manner, remembered
i- to forget the viÃims that were falling by
the hands of his apoftlei, at the very time
that he was boasting of recovering more tftan
[e ninety-nine of a hundred,
f. " n To crown, all his extravagancies, he has
fs lately/threatened to prosecute Dr. Hodge
for ttllihg Dr. Way, on the second day of
t- his fever, that he thought he might recover
rs without any more bleeding. The cafe of
e- Dr. Way is briefly this :âHe was atjack
r- ed on Sunday with the usual symptoms of
o- the prevailing fever; bled himfelf in the
in ffight,'about <2 ounces ; next day was bled
e- by advice of Dr. Rush three times ; took
re mercurial purges, which operated very co
le piously 5 011 Tuesday had an intermiflion ;
ig igat again bled once and purged several
L t- times. On Wednesday he tookT without
, m advice, eight grains of mercurius dulcis ;
n, had all aloHg since the attack observed the
fl. most abstemious and cooling regimen. By
,y whose direftion he was bled on Wednesday,
I do not know, for Dr. Ru(h did not vtit
ite him after dinner that day. The mercury
ny that he took of hi* own accord on
lr . day morning, brought on pain, fidknefs aid
on spasms in his-bowels, and otcafioned such
od extreme debility that he funk under it, and
in expired on Friday evening. The account
ay of the treatment till Wednesday morning,
ds- the writer had from Dr. Way himfelf.
he From this statement, I think Dr- Rush
all exempt from blame in the cafe of Dr. Way ;
he and that there are cases of high inflammation
;f e in which the patient sometimes recovers, un
he der the most herculean difcipliae, his most
inveterate enemies must acknowledge."
,ur This is certainly extraordinary language
tiiÂ» to come frpm a person who profefles such aip
" inviolable regard" for truth !âDr. Cur
iat rie certainly " remembered to forget" whilst
k- writing the above, that in spite of himfelf he
)r, was obliged to become one of the apojlles of
(ii 6 Dr. Rush ! How many " viftims" fell by
)m his hands, I know not, but I will venture to
aflert that they were left numerous after he
began the use of calomel, jalap and the lan-
I." cet, than whilst he was prescribing bark and
â Â»t wine.
Ip- The narrative which Dr. Currie has given
ins of the ficksefs and death of Df. Way,
>e- is commenced with a falfehood. Dr.
he Rush did not threaten to prosecute Dr.
in- Hodge for " telling Dr. Way, on the 2d
to day of his fever, that he thought he might
recover without any more bleeding."âDr.
ter Rush had heard from refpeftable authority,'
ip- that Dr. H. had said Dr. Way died in con
ro- fequencf of being bled too copiously by
>le Dr. R. The Dr. demanded, in a letter to
:n- Dr. H. whether be had propagated that ca
al- lumny. ITO this Dr. H. replied that he
ieh never interfered with the praftice of any phy
sician. This not being an answer to the
ng queflion proposed, Dr. R. wrote-a second
led letter to Dr. H.âto which the latter made
In no reply. I shall only notice further on this
!g- headâthat after Dr. Way's death, Dr. H.
fe- called at his house and enquired of his black
his fjervafit (from whose own tnoUth 1 heard
:ar the faft) how often her master had been
to bled.
be, The black servant informed him, and he

to In fill t the public with fucliagopinion, ;
after having iatclv given grains of the
fame medicine every two honts to a patient
in the fame disease and after having
spoken of this remedy in die following terms
â(fee his 2d pamphlet, p. 41, 42, 43,)
" In conjunction with blood-letting, mercu
rial purges were found more certain in their
effects and more ferweallc than any other
kind ; especially when exhibited in doses
from six to twelve grains, and repeated
every fix or eight hours, till a copious dis
charge by Itool took place ; and more efpe -
cially when their operation was promoted
by mild laxative enetr.as, administered three
or four hours after each dose of the mercurial
purge. Tliofe who have not had an op
portunity of obfeiving xhe good effects of this
pra&iee, will perhaps think it a very hazard
ous one." But he adds afterwards, " they
will change their sentiments ; for not wit L-
Jlanding "tne- [inflamed and irritable fta.te of
those parts, 'calomel, in large doses, palled
the pylorus, and oicnfioned less irritation till
it had reached the intestines, and was less
liable to be c'aft up, than any, other purga
tive."
With refpe&t to the following assertion,
Vvhich ought to have b<;en introduced upon
fubjeft of blood letting. I have already
{hewn that it is falfe. "Dr. Rush with
that precipitation for which he has always
been noted, instantly adopted the ptattice
in its utmost latitude, without reflecting
that difference of climate and cooftitution
made a difference in the disease." I (hull
that in all probability Dr. Currie
would be extremely happy if his precipita
tion in publiliing his account of Dr. Ruth's
conduft had not been greater than that
wliich Dr. R. employed i* the adoption of
blood letting.
I flwll now refrefh Dr. Currie's memory
with certain liittaoces of his extraordinary
â forgetfulnefs.
He has forgotten his obligations to Dii
Rush, for his early patronage of him when,
he had not a.friend in Philadelphia!
He baa forgotten, in calling Dr. Riifli's

He l\as forgotten the refpeftfill terms in
which he mentions hia riame in his treatise
on the of the United States ; and
how many extrads he has taken from Dr.
Rush's publications, to assist in filling up
that work ! He has forgotten the readi
ness with which Dr. Rufli forgave ,hiÂ» abuse
of liinyn 1793, and the cheerfulnefs with
which he has met him in confutation ever
since !
He has forgotten .in composing his ac
count of Dr. R's conduft in 1795, all hit
own abfurdiiies, contradictions and falfe
hoods, by vyhich he di ft rafted the citizens
of Philadelphia!
Ht has forgotten the disgrace he has iu
curred by defining hit patients in the late e
pidemic, *rj4 .flcÂ«lk'ng>from danger alter
nately in the country and behind a printing
press!
He has forgotten that his ideas upon the
fubje& of duelling were not always the
fame as they a#e at present, as has been
(hewn lately in the public prints ; it " af
fords (fays Dr. C. in his publication of the
20th October) Jq every reflecting mind the
strongest argument that he is deficient in com
mon sense, or that hit cause it unsound, and
will not bear a fair aad rational dfcujfion. In-
Itead, therefore, of being considered as a
maifh of cour&it, a challenge ought to be
considered a? a proof of guilt andthe challen
ger brandedwithinfamy." Accept then Dr.
C. these terms of your own, in reference to
the challenges you sent to Mr. Theodore
Willfon and to Dr. Fonlke.
In viewing Dr. Currie as the tool, and
ostensible author of the publication which
haibeen the fubjeft of these remarks,âhis
mind may be regarded as a fink into which
a number of filthy dreams have flowed
which after 'l-aiikling and putrifjing for

I (hall conclude my teply to Dr. Curries
publication of (sth of Oftober, by re
marking, that the most interesting fpefta

fpefted pftceptoY, in a scene of bulinefs and

even cheerful. I hatt however, lived t<j
fee a fpe&acle of'a more interesting and af
fecting nature, viz : This fame man whilst
performing similar services to his fellow-cit
izens in the year 1797, insulted and tradu
ced with as much virulence, as if he had
been the author of our late calamity ; and
that too in one injiancc by a man whom he
never injured , and who owes more ts him
thqn to any*other man in Philadelphia.*
Dr. Currie, in his publication of the 20th
Oftober, although he profeffes truth to be
the objesi of his researches, fays, " no no
tice will be taken of any thing that comes
from the pen of any person but Dr. Rulh
himfelf on the present occasion.
He ought to have known long ago from
the silence with which Dr. Rush treated his
indecent observations upon his account of
the origin of the yellow fever of 1793, that
nothing be writes would command the no
tice of Dr. R. Truth however is the fame
ffom whatever source it comes, âHe may
anfwetthefer'emarksornot as he thinks propef.
Had I not committed myfelfby my declaration
that his publication was falfe or .misrepre
sented, I would not have troubled the pub
lic with this reply to it. Dr C- cannot de
ny what has been advanced ; I therefore
leave it to the public to judge if my declar
ation was too harlh. Hereafter any pub
lication with Dr. Curries name to it will be
its own refutation. _
Dr. G. has attempted to be witty upon
me for wearing a Spencer ; I think it prob
able that Dr. Currie would efleem himfelf
happy if the peculiar cut of his Coat was the
only thing that now attrafted the attention
of the public. He has by his publication
set a mark upon himfelf. From this time
forward he must be viewed with horror and
contempt.

I Desire you will acquaint the lords
commissioners of the admiralty,' that I de*
tached rear-admiral Nelson, and the squa
dron named in the margin, with orders to
make an attempt upon the town of Santa
Crufc, in the island of Teneriffe, whiSh,
from a variety of intelligence, I conceived
was vulnerable. On Saturday', the 15th of
July, the Rear Admiral parted company,
and on Tuesday the 18th, the Ltander hav
ing joined from'Lifbon, I sent herafterthe
rear-admiral, under inflrucftions left by him.
The Emerald joined yefteHday, with the
inclosed di (patch and reports frop the rear
admiral ; and although the enterprize hat
not-succeeded, his Majesty's arms 'hive ac
quired a very great degree of lustre : Noth
ing frwn my pen can add to the eulogy the
rear-admiral'gives of the gallantry of the
officers and men employed under him. I
have greatly to lament the heavy loss the
country has sustained in the severe wouhd
of rear-admiral Nelson, and the death of
captain Bowen, lieutenant Gibfon, and the
other brave men who fell in this vigorous
and persevering a {fault. "
The moment the rear-admiral joins, it is
my intention to fend the Sea-Horse to Eng
land with him, the wound capt. Freemantle
has icceived in his arm also requiring change
of climate ; and I hbpe that' both of them
will live to render important services to their
king and country.

" The cnnfticution of the â¦hird year" was the 31
rallying point of the triumvirate in France and 2.
yet the authors and fupportern of that conflitUtion th
are proscribed and banifhid.
The cenftituttpn prohibits the armies fisom deli
berating on political fuhjeflsâand the Trinm- P e
vin attribute their/vecefs agiird the author* aind co
friends of the constitution to the deliberations tftht wi
armiei. an
The constitution declares the invioiAÃiLif v of crl
the persons of thÂ« .representatives,; apd .yet the i(
Triumviri have proscribed and hanilhcd upwards f
of fifty of the representatives of- the foveieig-n
people, -without trial. CX
There were thirty-fix Newspapers printed in Gi
Paris previous to the late political TornadoâThir- q
ty-two were fupprelTed by tfce Triumvirs, and
the Printers proscribed and banishedâsour cou- eOl
tinue to be puMifhedâall of which are Uid to be
edited by foreigners. By this it would appear that T>
the citizens of Paris ate oppolcd to the direiftory ma
in a ratio of more than eight to one. The truth j t ]
however can hardly be known .while the bayonet
continues to give law. ve '
The apathy with which tie puplt of France ap- "in
pÂ»ar to view the recent ufurpationi, and the over- Pri
throw of the conflitution, fuffiaiently evinces the
horrid condition of the country. Handed, during Q
fix years, from one mad faction to another, â
from Marat to Robespierre, mil from Robefpierr*
to Rewbel, âttripped of their pofTcffions by enor
mous requisitions, they folly realize that no change
of circumftaaces can deteriorate their condition.
The enthusiastic fervor which has led them thro' Bri
death and carnage, has evaporated, and left behind
the lees of tyifcry and dcfpaii*. Awakened from
their dreams of liberty and their fantaflic concep
tions of equality, they behold their religion taken Sch
from them, their privileges aboliflied, and their
property wrested from their hands. 11 Madness
has brought them to the-gates of Hell, âand there , .
has left them." Shi

Your pnhlifhing the following British Review Bri
of a pamphlet, which well deserves the perusal Sch
of every ferioui and candid inquirer after religi- (
ous truth, will, 1 am confident be plcafing to f ror
many of your readers.
The dangerous and unfcriptural doftrines
which the author so ably refutes, are, it is tq
be feared, rapidly extending their malignant in
fluence among us ; and therefor* every truly
; valuable effort to check their progress, and ex
pose their fallacy, merits general attention. As
luch Dr. Wharton's publication has jufily been
eonfidcred by the reviewers, and being the pro
<hiÂ£liOn of American pen, it will, 1 trust, , .
meet with as favorable a reception here, as it i!' 'g
has in Europe. Yours, Lor

[ Philadelphia : Ormrod & Cnnrad. 1796.3
This pamphlet appears to have been writ- Â« ,
â¢ ten and pubiifhed in the year 1791 ; but on l e%v
account of Dr. Priestley's arrival in' Ame- time
rica, and preaching the firft open an 3 avow- N(
* ed deface of the Unitarian system ever put
; licly delivered in that city, it is now re-pub-' "
w,th a preface, containing fnme re
| marks on that discourse. Dr. W. states the.'
serious alarm it had occasioned among " the
=4r P rofc{r Â° r ' of th e ancient doarines refpeft
ing Jesus Christ, and ialvation thro' him,"
[pub- anc ' â¢ , ft" ur es Dr. P. that however ready tliey
may be to facrifice theirprejudices torevealed 1
Lan- t ru tnÂ» yet conceiving their only solid foun- 1
'heat a,1 . 0n ' fÂ° r prefent.tranquility and future
for- r^ tri^u tion," to be, " the consolatory tenet
liam of atonement," they cannot yield d
up their present system of faith Â«to any â¢'
>wn- ''""g ftiort of unanswerable arguments, and
Dbls. 1 e m Â°ft luminous convidlion.' '
ld 7 1 ~D . r ,P' a flirts, "that Christianity, be- ra
:hias flde bein g proved to be true, must be Siewn 3
to be rattona'." But with Dr. W. the
lart, flm P ,e question is, Â« are these do'ariges
uan- commumc ated to us by divine revelation, or
left- are the .y not ? The reasonableness of this m
1 revelation is not to be proved or examined,
nty, oeeaufe revelation implies information of ut
:wt. J or " et hing > which reason cannot difcoyer ; no
7 ] b . , ancT therefore must bf different from all the j ei
do dedudions of reason." If christianity con
;ar. ; ta,n nothing but what lies within the reach P e
cts. ! of human reason, why was revelation at all lf
40 to man ? or why is it said to brbi ~
life and immortality to light ? Why does St-
Paul tell Timothy that great is the mystery fro
of godliness? Where was the need of.
hip Christ's laborious life, unparalleled fufFjr- L
led in Sf. and ignominioift death, to fanftion 0 .
lb. P lnl ons, to introduce a system of morals, !
qr., which reason alone could eftahlifh ? '
Having thus stated the question, and
:af- d^ avore d to shew that the mere reformation
of human morals could not be the grand
irn- n of Christianity, Dr. W. leads us to r 1
ei- enquiry on the ground of scripture and c lÂ°i
a- an, ;qÂ»ity. - mt
After the utmost, and apparently the PI"
ip, m Â°ft fmccre profeflioas of candor, and even I"' 1
ft- veneration for Dr. Prieftly'j charaaer as a ob j c
lan Philosopher and a man of letters, Dr. W. X
,Is. a <hÂ«rt abftraa of the doarine of the Z"
i'i new_Teftament refptaing Christ, in a pro- has'
ed Rreluve ordecâlliewing that our Lord Jirft the
rid taught his diciplcs to conceive of him as a P rÂ£ f
prophet, the promised messiahâand then mik
p, gradually led them on, to the higher parts *7]
ed of his charaaer, and to the fublimer truths gi '"
of Christianity, as they were able to bear his Â£'l
b. mftruaions. So the Apostles with like y
cantion and prudence began with the firÃ crue
n _ principles of Christianity, and led their con- , E
| g< verts on gradually to perfeaion. To this
â e- evidence Dr. W. subjoins the usual proofs '" va
from the Aas of the Apostles, and the Re-
of St. John, that the firft Chris- refoi
tians aauallr worfhtpped Jesus Christ. ! of v
la the next place Dr. W. appeals to the fnc n
early ecclesiastical writers, viz. Hegifippus, iu
t . Clemens Romauus, Ireneus, Ignatius, an >"
a Poly-carp, and Juftin Martyr ; particular- Â£, rod ,
Iy the latter : but the passages have been so
often cited that we forbear to copy them : Ung
. a we (hall however tranferibe a few remarka- colou
;> hie cxtraas from early Pagan writerg, which have
strongly corroborate the aflertion that JcfuÂ» the e
Christ wis worfhippfd by the firft believers. the 0
t 1. Pliny afferts,that, "the Christians met l"!'
before daylight to address therafelves in a tne p
form qf prayer to Christ, [so Dr. W. tranf. fcoloi
e lates carmenque Chrijli] ,aÂ« to some God." pies,
d 2. Antoninus Pius, in an Edia diVeded to
n the Stares of Aiia, fays of the fame Chris- Ofl
tians, "It is more f or them to bo Fr . enc
J permuted and die for their Gad, than to mi,rc(:
i continue in life." 3. Lucian charges them h""' '
, with " rejeaing the Gods of the Greeks,
and, rvorfhipping only that deceiver who was
. crucified." 4. Porphyry confefles, that,
,1 " si nce Jesus (whom he tlfewhere calls the ! J
, dead God) has been worshipped, no one has
experienced public affiitance from the 'n . T
1 Gods." Lastly. Julian reproaches the '1
j Christians " for worshipping two Gods,
contrary to the exprefs command of Moses." f a
Upon the whole we consider this as a â¢!
Traa, which does honor to the author, and W \
may be very seasonable in Philadelphia. If P
it has any blemishes, they are such as ard
very uncommon among polemic writers, jrtiVfc ' S
âan excessive candour, and extravagant a 7 tCni
