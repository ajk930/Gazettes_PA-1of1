The negociation at Lisle has Commenced j
under favorable atifpices, but tlie firft de
mands of the French appear to be very high.
The negociation betwixt the French an<* the
emperor still goes on, though it is said to
meet with many interruptions ; but the em
peror, afraid of Bubnaparte, exhauftrd in
his finances, and threatened by the king of
Pruflia, will ultimately, there is no doubt,
sign the articles of peace. The cabinet of
Berlin has, in fadl, pufolifhed a declaration
of war against the emperor, within these
few dafs. Switzerland begins to feel the
(hock of the revolutionary volcano, which is
also extending te the islands of the Archi
pelago, and pramifes very (hortly to (hake
the throne of the Grand Turke. The death
of Mr. Burke, at such a period, is an evÂ£n.t
of no fttiall moment.
Deeply versed as the French indisputably
are in that firft of revolutionary arts, the
deftruftion of every impulse of feeling and
humanity, they have never been able able so
far to revolutionize the brute creation as to
reduce them, in this refpeft, to a par with
themselves. It is a faft not less curious than
certain, that, at one of the allegoric feftivals
given by Robespierre, the oxen who drew
the car of liberty flopped (hort at the en
trance of the Place"de la Revolution, dif-'
gufted with the ffnell of blood with which
the ground was overflown. Every effort of

The lord chancellor, fpeakerof the house

The Paris papers have corrected their er
ror about lord Malmefbury being received at
Lisle with great diftinftion. His reception
was as we have stated it to be. The follow
ing detail of it is given in L'Eclair of the
13th instant :
" A discharge of 50 pieces of cannon did
not take place on the arrival of lord Malmef
bury. He was received with no honor what
ever, and even the guard at the gate was not
turned out. He was condufted to an hotel,
where two sentinels were instantly placed.
Citizen Artaud, president of the municipali
ty, and Le Clercq, commiflioner of the ex
ecutive directory, accompanied his lordship.
" The president offered lord Malmefbury
a lodging, which however could sot be got
ready in less than two days. He also offer
ed him every thing he and his suite might
be in want of, which was accepted by his
lord (hip. All the inhabitants of Lisle are
very much discontented with this kind of
reception ; but it is entirely attributed to
Letourneur, who, it is said, gave orders to
that effedt. Yet on his own arrival at Lisle,
he had no objeftion to be saluted with a dis
charge of artillery, and to have the streets
lined by the national guard from the gates
oif the city to his lodging." Morn. Her.
The French direftory, since the introduc

Lijle, July 14.
I arrived here only yesterday morning ;
and I believe I can already assure you that,
whatever reports may be circulated in your
city, in order to affeft the price of flocks,
we (hall soon have a well cemented peace.
This, at least, is the opinion of your friend
who'performs a very important part in
this momentous business. This likewise is
the opinion of every man of uiiderftanding.
Indeed, what power on earth can now pre
vent the conclusion of this grand work, fincc
on one fide both nations sigh for peace, and
and on the other every thing proves, that
Pitt, for the firft time in his life, afts with
sincerity. Some people r take pains to pcr
fuade the public, that the Dire&ory will
throw obstacles in the way of the negotiati
on, bot is it not univevfally known, that
the French nation on the one fide, and their
representatives ontht other, have openly de
clared their sentiments upon this fubjÂ«CV.â
To oppose the wi/hes of a whole nation whtf
fecured their liberty by forqe of arms
Avere to 7 expofe themselves to all the blame
and responsibility of future events, and even
to incur the guilt of treason ; in (hort, if
the negotiations Were to be broken off, the
two Councils would call upon the Directo
ry to acquaint them with their motives, and
the English Government, as they did on the
â former mission of Lord Malmefbury, would
1 make their conduCt-andproportions public,
in order to prove that they themselves aCted
with candour and sincerity. If ibe Direc
tory could have ftopt in the beginning they
cfcrtainly would have done it, and of this
we have * pro4f, iioce they disapproved the
conduCt of Buonaparte, in agreeing in the
the preliminaries with the;, Emperor to ad
mit to a Congrefe to be held an English
envoy ; now it is too late, and you may rec
kon with certainty upon a speedy peacfi on
tolerable terms."
The letter is certainly to be regarded on
ly as the reasoning of an indivdual ; but it
is obvious' that the French do not feel
conscious that their terms are calcula
ted to exasperate the English Court, and
to break the negociation. What those terms
are we do not know ; but from'various cir-'
comftances it is evident that the negociati
on will be spun out to a great length. If
we were to hazard a conjeCture on the out
line of the French projeCt it would be, that
they demand for themselves,
1. The restitution of all our conquefis in
the Weft-Indies ; a condition Much Great
Britain would not hefitite to comply with.
2. The restitution of their settlement in
the East Indies, butwith ahint that it might
be surrendered for an equivalent.
3. The surrender of the doCtrirre, that
free bottoms do not make free goods, by
which neutral vessels might in time of war
navigate fafely.
4.. An indemnity for their losses at Tou
lon ; an article of claim advanced only as a
make-weight, to be afterwards given up.
5. The formal surrender ofour mortgage
on Belgiumâan article, however, about
which they are careless, as they are in fniig
poffeflion.
For Spain and Batavia they would inti
mate that arrangement might be
made, by which they would suggest the ex
pediency of our conceding Gibraltar to
Spain, upon condition that she should grant
to the Dutch an equivalent in the Weft-
Indies for the Cape' â of Good Hope and
Ceylon, which should remain with us.
The Dutth Weft-India colonies to be res
tored, and an indemnity granted for the
{hips and cargoes ftopt in England at the
commencement of the war.
These speculations, however, are like all
that have been published on the subjeCt, ex
tremely vague, and perhaps very filly. We
can only fay, that we have made arrange
ments for procuring as early accounts as pos
sible of the progress of the conferences, and
without any idle boasting of our resources,
we may be permitted to fay, that our read
ers may at lesft-expeCt fidelity and candour
in our communications and that we will
not pretend to more knowledge than we

We flop the press to announce French
paper* up to Monday last, the 17th instant,
inelufive. They do not contain any. im
portant intelligence. Paris is perfectly tran
quil. The feaft of the 14th July was cele
brated with great order and oeeonomy ; and
Carnot, as President of the Directory, pro
nounced a difcourft interesting from the
tone of security with which he speaks of the
situation of the republic, and from the of
fence which it gave Jacobins, who
are daily propagating alarms of internal
danger.
" How pleasant it is," fays Carnot, " to
celebrate the day on which liberty had its
birthâthat liberty which arose out of the
bosom of tempests was preserved in the midst
of so many flioals, sanCtioned by so many
vidtoriesâthat liberty, in short, which gua
rantees a conflitution still new, but which
has already been proved by so many violent
attacks, by so many dark conspiracies, by
such unexampled success !
" Happy if, while the republic astonishes
the world with the eclat of her arms, and
stipulates with moderation, even on the the
atre of her victories, the conditions of her
peace and the repose of Europe ; wicked
men, animated by the vilest paflions, by jea
lousy, avarice, and the third of vengeance,
shall not succeed in tearing, her vitals.
" But what can these impotent efforts
j>vail against the national will, which de
mands an end to the revolution ? In vain is
an alliance formed betwein anarchy and def
potifnv ; between rage and hypocrisy ; be
tween Lous XVIII. and the shade of Ma
rat, to extinguish the social compact of'9s.
They will not fueceed more in'trying to de
stroy it by sudden explosion, than in execut
ing' the proje& of demolishing it piece by
piece.
" Republicans, alarmed for she fate of the
conflitution, be re-afTured. No, liberty shall
not parish. No, it is not a r<trogade move
ment, to make a necessary narch back to
the point which ought not to haxe been o
verleapt. Our legislators will know how to
stop at the point marked out by juflice ;
and that vigour of government which has
been able to strike down anarchy even in its
fury, will know how to prevent it from re
viving ; and will strike down royalifm in its
turn, if it shall dare to raise its proscribed
head.
" Friends of the republic, would you
hasten the moment of enjoyment unaltera
ble, keep at a distance from the impure re
mains of that abhorred seCt, those sanguina
ry defciples of Robespierre and Baboeuf,
who insolently mix their infamous cause
with yours.
" The republic, fay you, is about to pe-
/
ri:h. It is In coifcfintioa with all the efforts
of tfialignity ; its enemies enter in crowds ;
fansrtrcifm brandishes its flaming torch. Say
rather that the confutation is strong indeed,
fincebyits means, the republio can already
brave so many combined enemies'", since the
internal tfSnquiliry has fuffered no sensible
alteration ; lince each day, during the 20
months of its organization, our situation
has been incessantly improving ; since it
flourifhe6 } since it prospers in spite of the
clamours, in spite of the defamation, in spite
of the penury, under the brambles with
which they strive to ftifle it.
" May a separation then take place be
tween the cause of the good and that of
the perverse. May oar enemies be 1 num
bered that their nullity may be recognized !
" Frenchmen, <Jare at length to call your
selves republicans ! Dare to make a com
mon cause with the conquerers of Europe,
your fathers, your and your sons.
May all alarm among us cease ! May eve
ry one, in discharging with fidelity the du
ties which the neceflities of the state require,
feel himfelffafe in his liberty and property.
May he who has honestly acquired, enjoy
the fruits of his industry, without fear of be
ing despoiled by the molt crul enemyss of
the "republic, without fear of being the vic
tim of his civifm, of his confidence in the
word of the legislature, without fear of in
voking in vain the constitutional eharter of
his security and rights.
" Frenchmen, let us smooth the trifling in
terefls which divide us; let us carry even to
the feet of the Eternal Father, our free and
pure worship ; and may every one serve
God according to his own conscience, pro
vided we offer up oot' adoration in the Ipi
rit of love and concord. The dominion of
the law is separated from that of the con
science. True religion, whatever may be
its worship, is essentially the friend of order,
and of the obedience due to magistrates :
it is the friend, therefore, of the republican
conflitution. May every fort of worship,
then, be exercised freely, under national pro
tection ; and may they in their turn, who
demand only for themselves simple tolera
tion, not become the opprefTors of their fel
lowcitrizens.
" Yes : the conflitution is terminated !
You, who are still seduced by different views/
of imaginary good, renounce these delufion#
which render you miserable ; abandon thf
projefts of which you will soon become the
viClims : The time for exaggeration is pad ;
it is no longer by a revolutionizing enthuf -
asm, but by prudence and'firmnefs by whic 1
a revolution is consolidated, that you can fd
cure the basis of your happiness. French*
men, may this commemoration of the day
on-which you conqured liberty, contribute
to make it more dear to yon than ever."

lively acclamations of applause.

The patriots here had flattered themselves
th*t a revolution would take place in the
states of the duke of Parma, and that they
would be added to the Cifalpitie republic.
This hope has, however, been disappointed
by a proclamation from general Buonaparte

Parma, shall remain as fettled in the third

place, and to drive away the GoverOor. In
order to detach us from the Holy See, our
philanthropic regenerators had formed the
design of planting the Tree of Liberty, and
of aflaffinating all who (hould oppose this ci
vic ceremony. The Governor being inform
ed of the plot, made himfelf sure of the good
Citizens, and communicated to them the
circumstances. The Agents of the Con
spiracy were carefully watched, but no im
pediment was thrown in the way of their
design. The Tree of Liberty was aceord
ingly planted in the night's hut at the break
of day, the people were surprised by the
fight of fe\;en heads hung round the
tree. There appeared also the following
inscription: " Liberty and equality to those
who like them. Do you continue to plant
trees, -and we shall not cease to crown them
with your heads." To this was appended
a scroll, containing the names of all those
who had taken a part in the conspiracy.
The tree, and the heads, which were those
of the principals in the plot, including two
strangers, were soon after removed. The
Governor tranfmittedan accountofthis event
to the Court of Rome, and we since hear
nothing more either of Liberty or equality.

j PHILADELPHIA,
j SATURDAY EVENING, Ssptember 16.
To the Inspectors of the Hialth Office
for the Port of Philadelphia.
GENTLEMEN,
Agreeable to your request we now lay be
fore you the following brief relation of faÂ£ts,
refpefting the state of the City Hospital.
Since the commencement of this institu
tion, 169 patients have been admitted int&
it. Of this number, 62 have died, 31 have
been discharged cured, 1 have eloped, and
61 remain in the Hospital: of whom 14 are
convalescents. Unfortunately the difeafea
of many of thcfe patients were so far advan
ced previous to their admission, and the in
formation we received concerning them fa
imperfeft, that it was impossible either to
render them any effe&Oal medical relief, or
to form an accurate opinion of the real na
ture of their complaints, at the -firft attack.
Several of these had received some medical
assistance before they came our care,
while others were totally during
the iiivhole course of their illness. Of thefe
many died from 2 to 24 hours after their
admission into the Hospital. In the present
return 17 are of that description.
A great number of the cases which
under our obftrvation are billions remittent
fevers. A few have aflumed the appearance
of the Typhus IcleroiJtt attended with symp
toms which indicate a considerable degree of
malignity. One was the natural Small
Pox, another the Hooping Cough, and in
two the most striking symptom was dy.fen
tcry. The maligrtity in many inftgnces has
probably been much iocreafed by the unheal
thinefs of the places where tha sick haYe re
sided, fÂ»ch as frnall crouded houses in nar
row, confined, and badly â¢ventilated alleys,
as well as from other circumstances frequent
ly attending those who dwell in such places.
These circumstances have been rendered flill
more unfavorable by the general desertion of
the sick, which has been a consequence of
the present alarm.
Not having been yet called on by the at
tending physicians in the city and suburbsÂ»
to vifjt the sick now under their care, we
cannot give a decided opinion refpefting the
contagious or peflilential nature of the
es in those parts. We can only fay, at pre
sent, that though the Hospital has been al
ready opened 4 weeks, no inltance has oc
curred of its being communicated to the nu
merous attendants whose duty obliges them
to'be|among the sick both day and night,
in all fituatiom and in all stages of tbc Fe
ver. Nor have any ot the grave-diggers, or
those employed in removing or burying the
dead,i been in the lea ft affedled. We are,
extremely happy that' we have it is our pow
er to communicate pleasing information, si
it may in forae measure, contribute to leflon
the dread of receiving the contagion of the
disease by attending the fiek, and prevent
that general desertion which we have no
doubt has considerably encreafed the mor
tality.
We are,
Gentlemen,
Your most obedient fcrvants,

Last Tuesday evening, a French boy by
the name of Gabriel Du Cox, a native of
Rouin in France, belonging to the (hip
Aamilton of Boston, fell from the Market
Wharf, and was nnfortunately drowned.
Yesterday morning the body as a white
woman by the name of French Polly, was
taken up out of the river, a Corotiers inquetl
was held on the above bodies, who brought
in their verdift, " accidental death by
drowning."By this (Jay' 3 Mail. j. nf "

An unhappy accident took place yeftfr- v '
in the afternoon, at the Branch Bank 1
n<i\v building in Wat.er-!treet, by which " t
Mr. Abraham Kip., one of the masons, tl! ".
101 l his life, and Mr. Musgrove, a car- "'.' n
penter, was much hurt. .
'Mr. Kip was a faithful and induflriotis
man, and has l,cft a wife and several chil- '
dreci to lament his premature departure.
To prevent mifrepreferitations, we have
taken pains to colleft the following impar- '
tial ftatemcnt of the fafts refpefting this
melancholy catastrophe, from fpedlators of J
the tranfaflion, who have fubferibed their
names :âThe deceased had ascended the ll! F
roof; and went through it near the ridge
of the bpufe, in order to raise the j- 1
tackle, which was erefted to hoill the tun- _e
ber, and to fix it more permanent to hoist a
some flone for the back cornice, and being 0
near the tackle fad, his feet (lipped, and ces
he came to the ground, striking a timber k '
iu . the next ilory, which timber fell and to
wbunded Mr. Mufgrave.
It may be remarked with propriety, that . an<
the utmost caution h?s been observed by ! .
the managers of tlr;3 builing," since the com- tul
mencement Â©f it, and that this is the firft _
accident that has happened, which accideht '
was not for want 01 their care. * '

LONDON CORRESPONDING ltr
SOCIETY. â  | th
The society, pursuant to their advertise- j q i:
meut yesterday, attempted a meeting in the i
fields near Pancras, but by the adlivily of
the magistrates, were prevented from pro
ceeding to business. A crowd, confiding 5
of several thousands of perf6ns, men, women aa
and children, had assembled, at two o'clock, ar
when the aft, prohibiting Seditious Meet- 111
ings, having been read, and ftjme of the vc
members of the society beginning to har- at
rangue the populace, they were irtftantly '
taken into custody by the constables. The h<
remonstrance, >vhich follows this article, waÂ» 111
read no further than down to the wordsâ
Â«' Defpofs of Europe", when the reader was dl
instantly handed down from the tribune.â "
On the apprehension of these men, instead of
any Symptoms of resistance appearing, a pa- ni
nic fejjliied to seize the whole mass, who o:
nfn irf every direftion, leaving their leaders rl
to their fate, who were immediately con-
vtyed to Bow-street. Among these were 11
Galloway, Binns, Barrow, Fergufon, Stifc P
key, and Hodgfon, men formerly diftin- ir
guifh,ed for tKeir adlivity. c:
The only fpeeck pronounced from the "
tribune, previous to breaking up the meet
ing, was to this effefl:â ** That the time w
was at length come to determine whether c
Bow-street magistrates were to be the sole c
expounders of law I"âWhat followed was a
the brief comment on the text delivered, and t (
the business ended. 1
For some time a number of idlers loitered "
about the spot ; but at length separated t
without any reeourfe being hid to force.â 11
The London horse association, the Well- n
minster foot, and several other volunteer t
corps, were on duty in the neighborhood.

The Spani(h finances are in a date of the (
moll absolute derangement. The progress
of the-French principles too in Spain gives
the mod serious, and certainly well founded/?
alarms to the government.
G*n. Stuart is returning from Li(bon ;
and Gen. Deburgh, jointly with the prince | <
of Waldeck, is to command the Britith and : <
Portuguefc troops in Portugal. <
The French fleet now in Bred harbor is <
commanded by admiral it con- ;
fids of 12 (hips as the line and 9 frigates.â j
The admiral, it iÂ» said, has received orders '
to put to sea immediately. (
August 2. '
The French seem anxious to renew hof- '
tilities against the grand dnke of Tuscan) â 
With such intentions, a pretext is easily
found : Buonapare, under a pretence that
some Frenchmen have been infultcd in Leg
horn and Pisa, has sent a note to the grand
duke, threatening to march a column of
troops into his dominions, if the (lighted in
iult is offered to the French.
August 3.
By private letters just received from Tan
giers we learn, that the emperor of Moroc
co, Muley Solyman, has marched from Re
bat with a body of 63,000 cavalry, and is to
be joined on his march by his brother,
Prince Muley Tair, with another body of
35,000 horse, when they are to proceed to
gether to Morocco, with a view to indispose
their brother, Ben Drifs, who fotne time a
go usurped the throne. Should they fuc
cced in this attempt, which there is little
reason to doubt, from the very formidable
force which these princes have with them,
and which, we underdand, are equipped in
the bed poflible manner, the consequence
will be the total deftruftion of the Spanish
interest in that territory.
August 4.
A letter from Vienna of the 15th ult.
ftotcs, that M. Gradenigo, late feeretary of
the Venetian embassy, has been appointed
Venetian arhbaffador by the present provi
sional government of Venice, but not ac
knowledged in that qnality by the Imperial
couit. The fame letter adds, that the]
greatest part of the Hungarian army has re- j
ceivcd orders to march .to Udine, to form
the reserve of the right wing of the Impe
rial army in Italy, and that great numbers
of recruits continue to be levied in the Im
perial dominions.
We learn from Vienna of the 19th ult.
that count dobenzel, the Imperial ambassa
dor at the court of Peterfburgh, has been
appointed by his Imperial Majesty, numder
plenipotentiary at the congress (or the con
ilufion of a definitive treaty of peace be
tween France and the German empire.
A letter from Bolzutio of tlie 14th tilt.-. lonj

that all other Venetian towns were likely to | ers,

Though matters have not yet been bro't
to an issue between the contending parties at <
Iran's, yet there, at prsfent, appeals to be a the
disposition to'conceflion on the part of the tiv<
Dire&ory, which affords some grounds for ore
supposing thas they may be ultimately led Im
to the adoption of conciliatory measures. per
This however, we,conceive, will entirely he
depend on the degree of refinance which they int
(hall experience from the majority x>i the not
Councils, and from the extent of the refour- vol
ces of which they "may find themselves pof- of
feffed. Their pad conduft leaves no room ma
to hope that the majority of the Direftory nai
will ever be influenced by principlesofequity ed
apd moderation. rot
Should the Councils prevail, we dill con- T1
tinue to think that the negociations at Lisle by
may terminate fuccefsfully. Meanwhile, there ; wi
is one part of the conduft of the Direftory gr
that is calculated to excite the ftvongeft It)
suspicious. The frrmal approbation which wi
theyhave given to the marauding system pitin
surd by Buonaparte, in Italy, renders It cer- ag
tain that general would not undertake to re- wl
lutionize any country without previous in- fo<
ftrudlions from ParisâTo the Direftorv, un
j therefore, we are warranted in imput'iig the lai
J quarrel which Buonaparte ha? evinced a de- : w;
â¢ termination to promote with the Grand Lur
Duke of Tufcany ; and there can be little j T
ddubt that in this step, they are influenced an
by two motives. First, to extend, as far |tr
as may be, their revolutionary principles ; lo
and feenndly, to obtain resources for conti- th
nuing the war with this country, in the e- f"
vent of their being able to carry their point S.
at Paris, and, consequently, to persevere in re
their demands of such immoderate and dis
honourable terms as it will be impofiible for li<
us tn accede to.
The difference of conduft obserVed by the 31
direftory during the last negociation at Pa- Is
ris, and during thÂ£ .present negociation at
Lille, affords a clear proof that they dare
not make known to the nation the conditi
ons they fcave prescribed. They have inva- n
riably treated with open contempt all the ef- t<
tablifhed rules of diplomacy, and therefore "
it is ridiculous to suppose any regard for the 1
preservation of those rules would (way them J
in the smallest degree. They are aftuated 1
exclilfively by interest ; whatever they think I
will tend to promote their own purposes,
they will be sedulously promulgated ; and
whatever they are of opinion will have a
. contrary effedl, they will as sedulously con
. ceal. The sentiments of the people of France 1'
and of the majority of the Council has been
I too openly declared to admit of a doubt.â 1
These are friendly to the conclusion of peace
[ upon fair and equitable terms. To such t
[ terms our miniders have offered to accede ; t
. if, therefore, the negociation (hould We si- J
. nail off, the whole blame mull at- 1
r tach to the Dire&ory.

BALTIMORE, September 13.
Yesterday morning, about the hours bf
7 {"_ " seven and nine o'clock a most daring attempt
,'s â¢ was made to murder and rob the servant of
Je- Mr. James Carrell, as he was passing on
,rk horfebaek, from Perry-liall to this cityâHe
j was , aocofted by a, 6nglt nwin on- foot,
ers ' abont 8 miles from, town, on the new Belle
rip â¢ Air-road, near the Springs,, and de
ine fired to flop; -his he refufed to do; the
cd. | robber immediately fired a gun, the ball
on from which paHei thro-ygh the hat of the
servant without doing him any injury.âAs
of nearly as can bf remembered, the following
is a description of the person who made the
attemptHe is about 5 feet 7 inches high,
re- of a fair complexion, aud appears to be
flra 1 young and fprightiy ; had on a white
â¢tu- i fhbrt vellow firipe< gingham coaftee, white
lint | dimity waiftcbat, trousers birtoned clof'ely
,N. round his anclsi, aed ' f ftufFlike his
cOatteeâ4t Is fuppbfed .that his object wa<!
to obtain the horse on which, the ferjrant j *
was riding. r "-<
In consequence of the above daring at- ic f
terrrpt a number of gentlemen belonging to liev
different troops of cavalry, accbmpaned by be
| several other gentlemen on horfebaek, under j
ihe command of captain Samuel Hollings- Tsi
worth, turning out, with the greatest ,ala- inti
crity, and scoured the country in the vicin- pof
ity of Belle Air and Philadelphia roads, on
as far as thirteen miles from this city, but, dif;
unfortunately, without success. They met i"etl
with two little boys on the Belle-Air road, die
about 8 miles from the city, who had seen <
a man answering the above, description (a t'na
ihort time after the attempt was made) run- fto'
njng Rcrdfs the wood toward the other road, otl
with a gun tin his shoulder. The troop im- ed,
mediately pursued the direfted course, but '.n
without being able to gain any further intel- fut
ligcnce. It is supposed the villain in lurk
ing Philadelphia road with an in
tention to intercept the maij stage. '
It is ardently tb be wished, that the re-
peated attempts that have been made within
these two weeks past, may induce thÂ« execu- wa
tivp of Maryland to adopt some mode where- Ju
by those daring villains may be brought to Cr
punishment. It has now become dangerous
for a single person to travel the road, espe
cially unarmed ; and when we read of the
numerous accounts of robberies, &t. recent- hÂ»
ly committed in different parts of the Uni- th:
ted States, tUere cannot remain a doubt that
there are a band.of ruffians having commu
nication with each other, who infeft the ci- Fr
ties and country adjacent for the fake of a ]
plunder. '"1
There is no doubt but the villain is one
of a nest nsw secreted and lurking in the 1 t)|
city of Baltimore, intending to carry on J |; c
from thence their outrages against the peace I nf
and quiet of society, as favourable circum- pr
stances may occur. A fellow answering the
above description was seen last evening about j c
an hour by fun, in a thicket of bushes, on | ; n
â  the country feat of Philip. Rogers, efq- An let
' women who had occasion tb gb to a
: j spring.'and found him concealed and lying j
!in the bushes. He asked her if a trobp of
I hbrfe had not gone out in fcarch of a robber
I j who had fired on a travellor; (he answered r
, that (he had heard nothing of the kind; but la
: ' appearing agitated, he told her not to be | d<
alarmed; he intended her no injury and de- I
fired her to take up her water, go home, p .
and not mention that she had seen any I
- person; he immediately rose and made the
- best of his way off; a pursuit was made by a
j the family but without success. If the exe- j
â¢ I eutive of Maryland should offer a confidera- ''
ble reward, there is no doubt but some one I P
. of the gang would turn evidence and bring a
the reft to merited punishment. j

reajative to the origin of tlie present epidcrrn

A young man who tVas clerk to Mefc,
Tarafcoft and Journcl, having occasion to gd
into a cellar in Penn street (where it is (hp
pofed some goods had been depofitcd from
on board the snow Navigation] found a rood
disagreeable ilench <; immediately upon his
return, he was seized with a Vomiting, and
died in two days afterwards.
Quere ? Is it not ijidifpenfatly necessary
that every place in which goods have been
stored, coming from on bo'ird that, or any
other vefTel, conje&ured to have been infect
ed, (hould b? ftr?6lly examined and purified*
in order to prevent as much as pofiible, any

âthat the jeal- ufy between the outriofts of the two
armies was daily fermenting into discord, and that
even ftfTua ails of hostility had talcefi place in the
Friuli. That in conference of this he had made
a prercmptory remcnftrance, i-iit entirely in th*
loyalty of pacific intention, which he had
will be effectual ; but if it {hould not, he informs
the citizen* directors tbat he i* prepared to force'
the emperor to fulfil his engagements to the repub

CAUTION.
WHF.REAS a eombinaiion of men in this
county have undertaken to enrich tham
felves.bjr fabiicating titles to sundry valuable trads
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New
Yotk, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which
trails of hod large sums of money have been paid
to thÂ»fe fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers â¢
It is therefore just thrt public information should
We given, to the end, that the injured may feckrc
drefs while the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have beÂ«u discovered are Tru
man Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county ofSaratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
fevcral others who go under fictitious names. It is
supposed that the lands offered f r sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have ailual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and lÂ», Otfego patent,
thousand acres each, the a<3ual property of William
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and James Averill
and others, ot tlsii State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard Welis and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.âThe Winters witl do well to givÂ«
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purcbafing those lands, as also to de
prive those men in future from imposing oh indivi
dual, which their education and address have en
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a Ihopkeeper of some note in this tountry.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
of view tht wickedness of those men, which whan
the public have perused, will induce them to ex
cuse the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 28th, 17^7.
I Thomas Kelly, of the County of- Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to iign a
deed to them, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, which
was the property of William T. Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others ; Â»nd further the said Joseph
and Truman did persuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made out on the leth day
of November, 1793, or set back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the name of
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fictitious name,
there bciag no-inch perton there. To this I make
voluntary oath. â¢ THOMAS KELLY.
19th July, 1797.
On the 19th July, 1797, came personally before
me, Thomas Kelly, thefubfenber to the above af
fidavit, and made solemn oath that it contains noth
ing but the truth.
ELIHU PHINNEY, Juftjcc of the P W e.
On the lÃth Ju'y, I?*?;, came before me Jacob
Kibby, a perton l>y me well known and worthy.of
good credit, w(ip 011 his fotcmn oath did fay, that
two of the parties abovementioned did make ap
plication to him this deponent, font's time in the
winter*tof 1796, to make there a deed for twÂ® thaÂ»-
