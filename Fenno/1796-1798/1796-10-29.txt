I 03SERVED fomefhameful mif-ftatem'ents of the
â¢.vriterin your Gazette under thefignatureof Phocion,
refpeftir ; the-conduil ofMr. Jefferfon \vhile gover
nor of Virginia in the year 1781, and having been
jjerfotlally prEsent, in dftuaFfervice, throHgh all the
scents of that year, from its commencement,
jiid before, until after the termination of the siege of
York, I can state what that conduit real ly was, with
more trurband certainty than eitber'Phbcion or his
friend Charles Simms, neither of whom appear to
lenow much about what they have written, and .vere'
certainly neither of ihciTi in "Virginia at t-heperiod
referred to. First then, it is not ;rue that " Mr- Jef
icrfon abandoned his trust at the mrmtnt of ittvafjon I*âArmold's1* âAr-
mold's tni vAtir. r orÂ»k plSce in'January,l7Bl, Mr Jef
ferfon remainid in his ftarion through the whole pe
riod of that inva'lion. Cornwallis's invasion took
v'ace in-May,T7Bf, and hecontimiert'toadvairceinto
â¢he country ua til the be gi nn ng of June, when he com
menced his retreat before rite Marquis-Fayette into
'he lower country, on the fea-bord,.the Marquis hav
-13 rakrn the onsroand about two months before.
Mr. Jefferfon did not religjjpt all, orabandou Mstta
tioh, he remained in j ofiice until after Cornwallis's
retreat, and until the time for which he was confti
' utionallv elected, had expired, to-'wit, the 12th of
June, 1781. -Before he left the office, however, Mr.
4 jefferfon demanded of the legislature, a full enquiry
into the conduct of the executive for the last twelve
months, which'was accordingly granted by the refo
tian of the 12th of June, 1761, and the 26th of No
vember following appointed for the enquiry, being a
period of near fix months allowed to bring forward
any charges or proofs again ft Mr. Jefferfon. On the
s6th of December, 1781, the aifembly proceeded to
Take up the enquiry at lafge, on the report of a com
mittee of their own bo'dy, and having firft voted that
no charge or aceufation whatever, appeared against
Mr. JefFerfon, and " that there never -was any cause for
the hut fame vague and groundltfs rumours, 1 " 1 they
unanimously paired the resolution of the rath De,
eember, 1781, already published in your gazette, Mr.
Fenno, and which if Phocion's candour will permit
him again to read, he will find not merely an ac
knowledgment of Mr. JefFerfon's ability and inte
grity, and altogether fi/ent on the want of firmnefs, but con
taining express lhanksfor " his attentive adr,ation
of the polurrs of the executive tukih- in oj/ice."
Secondly, Mr. Fenno, It is not true that Mr Tef
firfon at any time fied before a few light-horsemen
and fhamcfully abandoned his trust, or, as suggested'
fey Charles Simms,contributed by his conduit to the
loss and distress which accrued to the state in the de
ftruaion of the public records, and vohchersfor gene
ral expenditureâLetfafts speak. In a few days after
the arrival of Arnold's fI.H, the enemy proceeded
150 miles up James's river, and land-d his trÂ»ops
within 24 m les of Richmond, the night before his
march to that place. All the militia of the state
which could be armed being then out, under the'
command ofGeneial Nelfon,.about fixtv miles dif
tant, in the neighbourhood of Williamfburih and
no defence at hand for the seCurity ofÃichmond, but
about 200 half-armed militia, under the commrnd
of Baron Steuben who could do nothing more than
cover the reraovrf! of the records and military stores
across James River, from Richmond to Manrhefter 1
and secure the boats and bat(eaus on the Manchester
fide to prevent the enemy's passing ; the writer of :
this remained 1a Richmond with the-laft detach
ment of militia that palled the river with re
cords and stores, "and until the enemy (about o
o clock in the morning) had entered the lower part 1
of the town, and began to fiank it with their light .
horse, he few-Mr. JefFerfon as active as man coSld
be, as well the night before, as that morning, Hie
ing his orders, ami using every exertion to remove '
the records ana stores. He afterwards saw him at 1
Weffhim,'five miles above Richmond, where Ar- 1
roid puflied a dctachment to destroy the stores at 1
that place, and which thro' Mr. Jefferfon's exertions â¢
were almost entirely saved. -The next day when 1
the enemy evacuated Richmond, the firft man the 1
writer of this saw, as he entered the town, was Mr t
JefFerfon. Let a candid public then determine whe
ther condnft lihe this, to which the writer hereof
was an eye-witness, manifested want 0 f firmnefs
or an abandonment'of trust. TV'lituatum of the' !
State was at that time peculiarly distressing the {
whole of its Continental quota of troops were then J
acting in Soul,h Carolina; manv thousand stand of t
arms had been fnppliedfor the defence of North Ca
roHna, and Arnold's invasion found the State al- '
most totally defencelefs. The state of things' was I
(little better in a fsw months afterwards whenCorr- f
wallis' invasion happened, and the Marquis Fayette 1
took the commard, since it is wellknown, that thro'
the whole Of that campaign, the Marquis thro' want 1
of arms never had more than three or four thousand 1
nnhtia badly armed, in aid of the few continental t
troops that were detached from the Northern army
to Virginia, such was the deplorable situation both '
of the State ano Continent, -for want of arms In 11
refpeft to Tarleton's sudden march to a
during that campaign, in order to Turprife the Go- t
vernor and A.Tembly, it will be remembered tJiat
the Marquis' army was inferior to Cornwall!.' and
had few or nb cavalry attached to it that at Char- *
lotfville there was not evena linglecompany of mi- a
litia, and that Tarleton made a rapid march of C
about 60 miles thro' the country at the head of about I 1
500 cavalry. The writer of this was alfb present i
at Charlottfville at the time, and saw Mr. Jefferfon V
and his Executive Council attending their dutv at' ! C
tHit place With theAflcmbly;]t will not be pretend ' 1
ed then, under the crcuutftanees stated, that Mr. c
A j J 1' a "dJhamefulty '
abandoned hr. truj}, as isfalfcly alFerted by Phocion

PHOCIONâNo. XI.
WE li âº seen that the firft advice given bv Mr 'H
Jefferfon to the people of Virginia, relative to the ' it,
ci/fiHitution, was not to adopt, but to try a-fecond no
convention ; his fulfequcnt advice was, to adopt or ! pa
not, on a tmtitifency, mat is, to adopt if nine gates de
had net p.ev.oufiy adopted, to reject, if that num. -Â»L
bcr of slates had previously adopted, in other words, St
to rJlque an ultimate di/mcmberrnent of the ftatea in i doi
- n experiment, to obtain the altetatioos which ht
deemedneceffary. On examination thit advice will
i.e found as pregnant with milchief to the United ing
wft absurd and whimsicaL
. the four hft deliberating Hates (particul.rly fZ
liacJ happened to be ftatei in geo-raphital the
contiguity, wLich was trerypoCble) had refufeti to'
ratify the cotilHtutioo, what might not liave been
the consequence ? Would the ajfinting dates have
tamely luffered themlelres to be ceerced into the a
''ie meHdmcnts, which the diffenttng states might have
'Â® n J di3a/ed? Could *ny thing but objections to the
een conliitution of the mod have'juilified
the the hazarding an eveathal schism in the union, in so
;nr , great a degiee as would have attended the advive
; Â°h given by Mr. Jefferfon ? Can it be denied thai the
his person who entertained these objeSions was llrong-,
to ly oppdfed to the confutation ?
ere' The opponents of the conliitution '-(or the anli
federalijh as they were called') acknowledged, like
r _ Mr. JefFerfon, the necessity and utility of union-,
ef- and generally fpea-ktni?, that the conltitution con
pe- tained many valuable Matures ; like him, they only
contended that it wa-ited ftittte eflential alteiations
to render it a fafeatid good government ; like him,
nto they only wanted a fecund convention, to alter the
iv- conftitutiori, fp as to temove alt the objtdh'ons iv+iich
had been made, by what they called the people, but
ls , s in truth, by a few faftiotis diforganizers or vifiopa
ti_ ry theorifti in the several Hates.
of If Mr. JefFerfon's advice was not danger 6at, it
? r - certaiuly was ridicultfus in the extreme. 'According
ve t 0 iat a d vlce Â» 'he queltion before a state conventi
o- OI ? would not have been on the merits or demerits
o- ol the constitution, but the only question would be,
I a in ivhat numerical trder theJldteJlood :if she wetc
'^ e ninth state, then it was uflÂ«aceflary'to discuss the
t0 merits of the instrument â¢; it mull be adopted
n_ evtnts ; but if she happened to be the tenth, it must
at then be rejected at all events, without any difcufTi
kr * n ' wou ' l ' ave heeÃ ftmply neccffary to hare
ascertained, haw many flateis had adopted, which
being known, the adoption or rejeSionfollowed
[r. of course ; and tho' in other cases, it flioald seem
that the more states had adopted a measure, the
stronger would be the recommendation, as an evi
dence as the approbation of the people, yet in this
on cafe, the ingenious Jefferfon reversed the rule, and
the more Aates had adopted, the less credit ought it }
j- to have with the temainder. ]
, d ' But when this very sage advice was given, it hap
ie pened never to occur to its author, that two con- '
-~ veutions might be in session at the fame time, and '
that either of them, by its adoption, would make '
C d ! hc " â¢' what was to be done is this dilemma ? ,
>s I" s sdvice was proper for Virginia, it was proper <
is ior all the other llates, how would they fettle the t

d haveiequired conferences and negotiations, in which e

t I' the contest had occurred between a large and c
>f a small state, Virginia and Delaware, for inffance, ?
the dispute indeed might easily have been fettled : 1
Virginia would lay, do you adopt, and we'll drive |!
t them into amendmentsi little Delaware would not p
t contend with the antient dominion : But a serious a
a difficulty would have arisen, had the contest beea a

have been concluded between them, I cannot fe< *

if both refufed to adopt, there would not have been c

â¢en- ceiifure t{lermajority of both huufisof tongrejs, the

a- and (paring not the chief ntagiftrate himfelf;
ive that in the support of this paper, thus hoflile to the
he .government,-in the administration of which he held
iecl so important a trust, he did not ferqple to apply the
'so' money of that very government; departing by this
ive conduct from the rules qf ofii ial propriety and ob
he ligation, and from the duty of a discreet and patri
ig. otic citizen.
This charge iÂ« fapported in' several ways.
li- I ft. By .diredf proof of an e^/a/connexion be
ri;< tween \hc. secretary of Jlate and the editor of the
in-, National Goaetteâa little antecedent to thef r/i ejla
n- blifhment of that paper.
ily 2d. By direst proof, as we have seen, of the
ns secretary's being opposed to the .present govern
m, ment of the United States, while it was under the j
he confederation of the people.
eh 3-d. By his avowed opposition to the principal '
ut nteafures which have been adopted in the course of 1
a- its administration, particularly those relating to the '
finances. 1
it As to the conueSion betweea the secretary of Jlate and 1
,g the editor of the National Gazette, neither of the, sol- a
j loÂ»/ing faifls can or will be disputed. <
I ft- That the editor of the National Gazette was a j a
clerk in the department of Jlate for foreign languages, i a
e > and as such, received a Jalary oftiuo hundred undfjty ,
lc dollars a year.
Ie id. That he, became so antecedently to the eftabJifh- j C
ill ment of his Gazette, having adtually received j n
ft ry from the 17th August, 1791, and not havingpub- j v
j. lifned the firfl number of his paper till the 31ft Oaober I n
following. I tj
3d. That at the time he became so, there was ano-I si
" ther character, a clerk in the lame department, -who 0
d underflood the French language ; asd that the editor of j
n the National Gazette was a tranjlator oj that language
e only. I.tl
4th. That the appointment was not made under any a '
s _$Â«*W,provi(ion, marking out a particular clerk, Tup of I Â«
, the kind, its duties, or its emoluments ; but under a tl
general authority to, -appoint clerks, and allow them fa- e
' la nes, Bot exceeding the average of five hundred dol- ; r
lars eaeh. |
jth. '4'hat the editor of the National Gazette, imme- Â°'
, diately preceding the eftabliflunent of'that-paper, Was P'
the fuperintendant or condu&or of a paper belonging j in
e to Childs and Swaine, printed at New-York. m
? These are theJaHs : the conclujon is irrejfjiahle : the ar
â¢ Jecret intentions of men being in the repositories of their m
r own breasts, it rarely happens, and is therefore not to
t be expe&ed, that -4iredt and pefitive proof of them
, can be adduced. IyÂ«
j Preemptive fatfs and e&cumftances biuft afford the P r
evidence, and when these are Efficiently ftrone, they Â«
ought to decide. j [j.
We find the head if a department taking the editor Lur
of a Gazette into his-employment, as a clerk, with a co
Â» Jtated Jalary, not for any Jpecial purpose, which could
not have bftn accomplilhed otherwise; for besides bis I
own competency to translate from the French, and his ?
( general pradhce, he tad, at the time, in his depart
. ment, a clerk, who was eapabk of performing the
. ycry Jervice required, and cofild, without difficulty,
; have procured others Gmilarly qualified: nor, from any
â¢ particular necessity arising from a too limited allow
-1 ance, or any other cause ; for he had it in his power to
1 allow an adequate compensation to a character who r
t might have been regularly attached to the department.

I requett you will inform their lordfliipl, that otÂ»
the 22d of August, at ten A. M. a fail was discoÂ»
vered in the s. s. w. quarter. 1 immediately oii
patched the Galatea after her, who made the fig n3 '
of her being an enemy's frigate. I therefore sal-lowed with the reft of the fhipi, sni soon abfefved
thatjhe was Handing in and near the mouth of the
Garonne. Captain Keati, however, with much
address, cut her off from the enuance, having pass
ed, with the Galatea, between the Chevrier bank
and the light house : the enemy then wore (hip, and
stood along (hore to the fonthward, being ptirfued
by "all the squadron, and keeping within half gun
ftiot of the coast. The Artois and Sylph, which
had been detached to examint two large (hipa that
appeared suspicious, continued their course in the
offing, when, about 9P. M. the horizo. became
4ark, attended with violent squalls of extreme heavy
rain, lightning and thunder, so as tr> oblige the
Galatea, and this (hip, who were nearly within
(hot of the frigate, to (horten fail, and keep away
at timet, and it was supposed (he had bore up, as
wc lolt light of her.
1 therefore stood with the Anfon so the north
ward, thinking (he might have hauled her wind that
way ; but at day light, feeing nothing of her, tack
cd, and continued our course to the southward, un
til we discovered her run on shore, with the loss of
hei mails, within five leagues of Arcaffun, and the
Artoil, Galatea and Sylph (who had seen her again 1
(luring the night) at anchor near her, when (he was
boarded with much ri(k and gallantry, by the boSts 1
of the Aitois and Galatea, under the command of <
lieutenants Lloyd and Carter.
It was impoflible to prevent the men from endea- (
vouiing to escape on (hore, although great numbers 1
fell victims in the attempt, owing to the great furf i
and fwfcllthat set upon the beach, and of cout/e ma
ny were drowned.
Her captain, and some of the principal officers,
with several Portuguese prisoners, part of the crews '
of two Brazil (hips, taketi by the division to which 1
this (hip (which was named l'Androraaque, a Very '
fine and large frigate, pierced for 48 guns, twelve '
pounders, moll of which had been thrown over- '
board, and her compliment 300 men) belonged,
were brought on board the (hips of this squadron, 1
when she was set on fire by our people, and complete- '
ly consumed before they left her.
The officers and boats crews of the above meati
oned (hips, behaved with the utmost a&ivity upon
this occasion.

LONDON, September 17.
Yesterday we received by express the Paris jour- '
nalsto the 15th and tliofe of BruiTels '.o the 12th.
By an article inserted in the latter, we are led to
bclicye that Jourdari intended to assemble all hit dif
ferent corps at Frankfort, when it is probable his <
head-quatters are arrived by this time. Some of
the letters pretend that Jourdan's retreat is only a 1
llratagem, calculated to draw the archduke-jnto a a
more fatal snare than that into which he fell by i
Jourdan's retreat across the Rhine at Coblentz, in i
the beginning of the campaign. But we do not c .
concur in this opinion. Jourdan's letters plainly '
shew that he has fuftaitrtd several severe defeats
We jdo not think it improbable that either the arch
duke will cut off Moreau's retreat, or Moreau will
cut off the archduke's. Moreau's army now be- "
comes much more an object of intereil than that of '
Jourdan. Fiom the banks of the Nab to Ramelf
berg, the distance which Jourdan has retreated
since the archduke crossed the Danube at Ingol
ftadt, is full Ijo miles.
