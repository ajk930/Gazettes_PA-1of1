This publication presents a concise statement
ef the base means pradifed by the Jacobins of the
United States to asperse the characters of those
perfonswho arc considered as hostile to their disor
ganizing' schemes. It also contaiis the cor
respondence between Mr. Humilton and Mcffrsu
Monroe, Muhlenburgh and Venab'e, on the i'ub
jc& of the documents aforefaid, and a series of let
ters from James Reynolds and his wife to Mr. Ha
milton, proving beyond the poflibility of a doubt,
that the connection between him and Reynolds,
was the rel'ult of a daring confpirasy on the part
of the latter and his associates to extort money.

have a second reading, and be committed.
It appeared to him that this would be a re
gular way of getting rid of the difficulty
which was apprehended. The gentleman
just set down said, that this was not the
fird, second or third time that the house had
been troubled with similar petitions. This
he fr.id, was natuaal. If any number of
persons considered themselves aggrieved, it
was not likely they (hould leave off petition
ing, until the house (hould aft upon their
petition. He thought this was the way
that they ought to do. If the Quakers
thought themselves aggrieved, it was their
duty to present their petition, not only three
five or seven times, but fev?rity times, until
it wa3 attended to. Gentlemen, therefore,
who wished not to be troubled again, ought
to be in favour of a second reading and re
ference. At present they did not know
what the particular grievance complained of
was, nor whether it could or could not be
remedied. He believed that one of the fub
jefts of complaint had a reference to a mat
complained of in a memorial presented at
the tail feffioti, rfcfpefting some dark com
plex ioned citizens of North-Carolina, who
â were* injured by the operation of an aft of
the United States, called the Fugitive Aft;
but as it was the wish of the house not to
enter upon any business of a private nature
at that time, the petition was ordered to
lie on the table. It appeared, therefore,
highly proper that this petition be referred,
as was cuitomary, to a committee, that
this grievance might be rclnedied.
Mr. Lyon said, it appeared to him that
the gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr. Har
per) had not attended to the fubjeft matter
of the petition, or he would not have ob
jefted to it 3 being read a second timc.There
was a grievance complained of, which cer
tainly ought to be remedied, viz. that a
certain number of black persons who h*d
been ,set at liberty by their matters, were
now held in (lavery contrary to their right.
He thought this ought to be enquired into.
Mr. RuTLEDGE'ihould not be opposed
to the second teading and reference of this
memorial, if he thought the drong censure
they deserved, would be the report of a com
mittee. The censure, he thought this bo
dy of men ought to have; a set of men who
attempt to fedgCe the servants of gentlemen,
travelling to the feat of government, who
were incefTantly importuning Congress to in-'
terfere in a business with which the consti
tution had fafd they had\nb concern. If he
was furc tips conduft would be reprobated,
he would chearfully vote for a reference of
the present petition ; but not believing this
would be the cafe, he fliould be for its lying
on the table-, or under the table, that they
might not only have done with the business
for tp-aay, but fuiallr. At a time when
some nations were witnesses of the mod bar
barous and horrid scenes, these petitioners
were endeavouring to incite a class of per
sons to the commifiion of similar enormities.
He thought the matter of the greatefl im
portance, and that the reference ought by
110 means to be made. A grntleraan before
him (Mr. Lyon) had said, that they had
certainly something to do with the detenti
on of free men in slavery. If the faft were
as dated (which he doubted) redress ought
to be fought by means of a court of judice,
and not by petitioning that house.
Mr. Svvanwick was sorry to feefo muck
heat produced by the introduftion of this
petition." He himfelf could fee no reason
why the petition (hould not be dealt with in
the ordinary way. If the petitioners asked
for any thing which it was not in the pow
er of the house to grant, it would be of
course refund ; but this was no reason why
their petition fliould not be treated with or
dinary refpeft. In this memorial, he said
sundry things were complained of; not only
ilavery, but several other grievances. â¢ For
indance, play-houses were complained of,
whether justly or not, he was not about to
decide. With refpeft to the grievance
mentioned in N. Carolina, something, per
haps might be done to remedy it, without
affefting the property which the gentlemen
seemed so much alarmed about. He could
not suppose there was a disposition in tbe
house to violate the property of any man ;
there was certainly as strong a disposition in '
the middle Hates as in the foutherri, to hold
inviolable ( the right of property; nor could
be fee any leafonable ground for throwing
this petition under the table. If these peo
ple wcrt wrong in their underftariding of
this fubjeft, it would be best to appoint a
committee to set them right. He was for
â ry to hear gentlemen charge so refpeftable a
body of men in that house <*f attempting lA
seduce and debauch their servants, frtr if
this were the cafe, redress could doubtless
be had in a court of juflice. The uncommon
warmth which was (hewn 011 the occasion
would lead .persons to suppose that gentle
men were afraid of having the matter locked
into, as this was generally the temper re
sorted to when argument w-;s wi.sting. He
lioped the memorial witul.l be dialt with in
the usual way.
Mr. Gallatin said, it was the praftice
of the House, whenever a memorial was pre
sented, to havs it read a fir It and second
time, and than to commit it, unless it were
exprelTed in filch indecent terms as to induce
the house to rejeft it, or upon a fubjeft u
pon which petitions had been lately rejefted
by a large majority of the house. In'no
other cafe were petitions rejefted without
examination and without discussion. He
said without examination and without dis
cussion, because it* was impossible, upon a
single reading of a petition, to be able to
form a found judgment upon it. Indeed,
feeing the way in which the
S. Carolina (Mr. Rut-ledge) had treated
the futjjeft, no cool examination could be
expefted at present ; in the moment of pas
sion it would be best not to decide, but to
feÃd the petition to a committee. What
were the objections to this mode of proceed
ing ? It was that the fubjeft would (hake a
certain kind of property. How so J A pe
tition that reminds us of the fate of certain
Jilacks in this country ; which did not refer
to (laves, but to free men. This petition
was to (hake property ! In the fame manner
it might be said, that the law of Pennsylva
nia for the gradual abolition of Ilavery, had
also a tendency to destroy that property ; or
that the legislative decision of the state of
Massachusetts that there shall be no (lave un
der their government, wouldhave that effeft.
But it wqs fa:d, 'the eharaftersiof the peti
tioners was such as they ought to brand with
the mark of disapprobation. In support
of this charge, it was alledged that they
were not fatisfied with petitioning, but that
they attempted to <febauch and seduce ser
vants to rt,b gentlemen of tlneir property. â
He did not know to what the gentleman
who made this assertion alluded ; but he
believed, if the matter were fairly dated,
whatever may have been done in the.date of
Pennsylvania, has been no more than an en
deavour to carry into full effeft the laws of
the state, which fay, " that all men are free
when they set their foot within the state,"
excepting only the servants of members of
Congress. As to the moral charafter of this
body of people, though a number of their
principles were different from those which
j he profefTed, he believed it could not be said
; with truth, that they were friends to any
kind of disorder, and he was surprized to
1 hear gentleijien suppose they could or would
do any thing which would throw into dis
order any'part of the union. On the con
trary, he believed them to be good friends
of order. Mr. G. r ai<3, he wilhed to have
avoided a discussion of, the merits of
the memorial ; but when they were
told it was improper to do any thing on the
fubjeft, it became neceflary. He knew it
was in their power to do something. They
might lay a duty of ten dollars a head on
the importation of >flaves ; he knew a me
morial had been presented at a former session
refpefting the kidnapping of negroes, which
had been favorably reported upon.â Final
ly, tbe present memorial did not apply only
to the blacks, but to other objefts. With
refpeft to plays, they had a motion lad sessi
on before them for laying a tax upon ihem,
which had a reference to the 'fubjeft. By
committing this memorial, they (hould give
no dectfion. If the committee reported they
Could do nothing in the business, and the
house agreed to the report, the matter would
be closed in a much more refpeftful way
than by throwing the petition under the
table. ,
Mr. Sf.wali> said, the gentleman lad up
had dated two cases in which petitions had
been rejefted, without a commitment. He
might have added a third more applicable to
the present memorial. This was, when a
petition was upon matter over which this
house had no cognizance, especially if it
were of such a nature as to excite disagree
able sensations in one part of the house, who
were concerned in property which was al
ready held under circumstances fufficiently
disagreeable. In such cases, they ought
at once to rejeft tbe memorial, as it would
be mifpending time to commit it. If, for
indance, a petition should be presented com
plaining that a person had refufed to dis
charge an obligation to another. It would
be at once acknowledged that the house
could not enforce the obligation appli
cation must te made to a eourt of judice.
So in this cafe, th? petitioners complain of
a law of North Carolina. This house, he
said, could not ehange that law. If any
thing was done there contrary to right, the
oourt of that state, as well as those of the
United States, were open to afford redress.
It was their business, and not the business
of that house. They did come there to aft
upon fubjefts agreeable to their feelings, but
upon such as the constitution had placed in
their hands. The gentleman from Pennsyl
vania had said they might impose a tax of tfn
dollars upon the importation of evety (lave.
Would this, he asked, relieve the petitioners?
No. If they could prevent the kidnapping
of aegroes. it was well ; but nothing was
aimed .a tof this fort in the petition. He
reeollefted a former instance of this kind,
but the iffiie of the business (hevved that no
thing could be done without injuring the
public more than individuals would be be
nefitted. The petition alluded to Stage
Plays. With what view ?To raise reve
nue ? No ; but to a correftion of them with
refpeft to morals. It was not within their
province to do this, but under the power of
the state governments. If they were taken
up for the state of revenue, they did npt
come within the purview of this petition,
but of the committee of ways and means.
Upon the whole, as he considered this a dan
gerous business, and that they could do
nothing to gratify the feelings of the peti
tioners, he would not wish to treat the ap
plication with contempt, but let it lie on the
tahle.
Mr. Macon said, there was not a gen
tleman in North-Carolina who did not wifli
then? were no blacks iu the country. It
was a misfortune ; he cotifidtred it a curse ;
but there was no way of getting rid of
them. Instead of peace.makers, he looked
upon the Quakers as auar-tnnhrs, as they
vvert continually endeavouring in the south
ern Rates to stir up irffurreftions aKiongft
tflc negroes. It was unconllitutional, he
said, in these men to desire the house to do
what they had no, poiVer to do ; as well
might theyafk the President of the Uilited
States to come and take the
There was a la'w in
which forbade any perfqil fi:omj;]jflidiuÂ£- ei-s
ther a black or white period as a,flaw after
he had been set at liberty. The 134 ne
groes alluded to in tht petition, he knew
nothing of. In the war, (aid, the Quak
ers in their state wets tories ; thty
began to set free their negroes, when the
state pafled a law that they (liould not set
them free. If these people were difatisfied
with the law, they had nothing to do, but
traiifport then negroes into Pennsylvania,
where thegentleman from that state had told
them, they would be immediately free.â
This fubjeft had been already before the
house, but they declined doing any thing in
it. It was extraordinary that these people
(hould come, session after fefTion, with their
petitions on this fubjeft. They had put
playhouses into their memorial ; but they
had nothing to do with them. In this
state, he believed, the legiflaturc had palled
a law authorizing them. It was altogeth
er a matter of state policy. The whole pe
tition wass indeed, unneceflarv. The only
objeft seemed to be to sow difTetition. A
petition could not come there touching any
fubjeft on whiph they had power to aft,
which he (hould not be in favour of com
mitting ; but this thing being wroDg in it
ffrlf it was needless to commit it, as no (In
gle purpose could be anfweredby it.
Mr. Al len was in favour of a second
reading and committal. He did not know
that no good could arise from such a pro
ceeding. He wished tlhJe to confidcr the
matter. He had ariotfier rdifort against get
ting rid of this business. When the debate
upon this question came to be faithfully re
ported, it might Be said that the Society of
Quakers had been found guilty of such foul
conduft, that thtir petition to the house
had been throwu under the table. Another
reason. Last summer, along with other
â ft rangers, he went to fee the new gaol of
this where he was (hewn a man who
had been a manumitted (lave ; but after be
ing free twenty years, he was apprehended
under the fugitive law, and was there impri
soned. If this were so, it was n#Ceffary that
this law (hould be revised. He hoped,
therefore, the petition might be committed,
and that this evil might be remedied. At
all events, he truftcd the petition would not
be-rejected, as it would be highly difrepeft
ful to a society of men reveted by every
man, who set value upon virtue and ''integ
rity.
Mr. Livingston said, if he could be
lieve that the petfons who presented this pe
tition were of the defcrfption which they
had been reprffertted ; thai they endeavour
ed to raise infurre&ions in pne part of the
country, and pntftifed â¢ robbery in another,
he (hould not b# inclined : to pay much ref
peft to them. Bat he dM Hot believe these
charges; he believed them lndiferiminately
made and unfounded. It was pollible that
a member of this community, as well as of
any other, tnight bÂ« of this description ;
but as against the body, he knew the Charg
es were unworthily made. He was ac
quainted with many of these persons in those
dates where they were mart numerous, and
he was certain they did not deftrve the cha
rafter given them. Therefore, as the mat
ter refpefted the petitioners, the petition
ought not to be thrown under tie table. Let
us now, said he, examine the reqUest, and fee
whether it be so improper and impraftica
ble, as to make us fay, on its filft reading,
we have heard enough. Why do (hey a(k ?
They fay a certain number ef citizens are
deprived of what belongs to them ; and can
we fay we will not grant relief ? No, said
he, we cannot, before the business is enquir
ed into, as it would be aftisg unlike the le
giflaturc of a great nation. If they said this
application was so improper as not to be
committed, what did they fay to their pre
deceflors -who fat in thatltoufe a few months
ago, who not only received an application
of a similar kind, but a committee reported
in its favour. They said, universal emanci
pation is not in oirr ]so\ver ; but the evil is
one for which a partial remedy may be pro
vided. The want of time only prevented
its being afted tipon. This was an objeft
upon which they 1 might at lead debate ; he
could not fay whether they could afford a re
,medy, or not. His owr. impreflions were
they cou Id not ; but he yould not fay they
never could. He did not think he (hould do
the duty which he was sent there to do, by
faying so ; which was to follow the diftates
of a sober judgment, after fafts were fairly
and fully stated. He thought it best to
follow the usual course, by appointing a
committee, who would examine the mat
ter, and report what was best to be done,
which the house could agree to, or not, as
they thought proper. Hethoughtit would
be for the advantage of those stateÂ« most in<-
terefted in the question, that it (hould be
fully difenfted and difpafllonately decided
upon ; for so JÂ»i}g as the petitions of these
persons were neglefted,<ir : treated with con
tempt, so long wovrld they conceive tficy
were unjuitly treated, <iod n fcoiatiriue their
applicatiohs for redress. Mr 1 . L. said there
were a number of general refleftions con
tained in the memorial upon the grbwth <sf
vice and immorality, to th 6 fu]6priffion of
which he did not fee that the power of Con
gress extended. They pattituEMyJMJfttkd'
at the eftablilhmert of play-houses ; but it
might be remarked, that these gentlemen,
so averse to the eftablifhmerit of play-houses,
have not written their memorial without
borrowing language â¢ from them, as they
term the evils tvhicw they (peak of a terrible
â trsgedj. . '
Mr. Isaac Parker was of opinion with
thegentleman from Peftitfylyani.a (Mr. Galla
tin) with refpeft to the disposal of peti
tions ; but it appeared to him that the fub
jeft matter of all petitions (hould be within
the view and authority of the house ; if not,
to refer them, would certainly be a waste
of time. He had attended to the petition,
and he did not tliifik there was a single ob
ject upon which it was in their powerto act.
Nothing was praved for. The petitioners
speak 6? the slave trade and in general terms
On the immorality of the times as injurious
to the state ps society, and wiili some means
(nay be taken c,o present the growth of
them. To refer a petition of this fort", there
fore, to a committee, could anfvver no pur
pose. He did not think they were more
obliged to take tip the business, than if thty
had read the address in a news-paper.
Mr. Bayard said, it might be imagined,
from the anxiety and warmth of gentlemen,
I that the question before them was, wheth-
I er slavery (hould or (liould not be aboliihed.
The present was however very remote from
such a queftioÃ, as it was merely whether
a memorial (hould be read a feiond titne.â
The contents of this memorial, he said,
were right or wrong, reasonable or ttnrea
fonable ; if right, it was proper it (hould
go to a committee ; andif wrong, if so clear
ly absurd as it had been represented, where
would be the evil of a reference for a report
thereon. He did not like things to be de
cided in the moment of paflion, but from
the fulleft consideration. In some coun
tries, they knew persons accused of crimes
were condemned without a hearing : but
there could be but one sentiment as to the
injustice of such a proceeding. There could
i be 110 objeftion, therefore, upon general
' principles, to the reference of this petition.
But it was said, it was not to be sent, be
cause of the general habits of this society.
, He there was nobody of men more
rcfpeftable ; they were obedient, and con
tributed chearfully \ to the fupporc of go
vernment ; and either politically, or civilly
speaking, as few crimes could be imputed to
that body as to any other.âThis memorial,
he said, had been treated as coming from an
abolition society ; it was a memorial of the
general fnrttihg of the people called Qua
kers ; andifonly out of refpeftto that body,
it ought tobe referred. But it wasfaid, it did
not contain matter upon which the house
could aft. Gentlemen feemtdnot tohave at
tended to the fubjeft matter of the petition.
He did not believe that the house had the
power to manumit (laves ; but he believed
there was not a word in the petition which
had a reference to slavery. The petitioners
state, indeed, that a number of negroes, not
Haves (for negroes may be free) as having
been taken again into slavery, after they had
been freed by their matters. He wished td
know whether the house had not jurisdic
tion over this matter ? He was warranted by
the eonftitution in faying they had ) because
that instrument fays, that no state (hall
make ex post fafto4a*vs. It belonged to
that house therefore, to fee that the coufti
tution was refpefted, as it could not be ex
pefted from the justice of the individual
tlates, that they would repeal such lawc. It
rested, therefore, with the government of the
United States to do it. Mr. B- read the
clause of the eonftitution touching this mat
ter, and concluded by reminding the house,
that this was not an ultimate decision, but
merely a reference.
Mr. Jos I a h Parker said, he wa-salways
inclined to lend a favorable ear to petition
ers of every kind ; but when any memorial
was prefcnted to the -house contrary to the
uature of the government, he (hould consent
â¢to its lying en the table, or under it -No
one, he said, could fay they had a right to
legislate refpefting the proceedings of any
individual state; they, therefore, had uo
power to decide on the conduft of the citi
zens of N. Carolina in the matter complain
ed of.âPetitions h'.d frequently come from
Quakers, and others, on this fubjeft, where
as this government had nothing to do with
negro slavery, except that they might lay a
tax upon the importation of flave6. He
recollefted, when the fubjeft was brought
before the house in the firft congress held, at
New-Yoik, wishing to put a stop to the flavt
trade, as niiich as possible, being a friend to
liberty, he took every step in his power, and
brought for ward-a proposition for laying a
tax of ten dollars upon every slave imported.
It was not agreed to ; but there was only
one state (Georgia) in which the importa
tion of (laves was admitted. Since theeftab
lilhment of this government, Mr. P. said,
the situation of (laves was much ameliorated,
and any interference now njight have the
effeft to make their mailers more severe.
He knew of no part of the eonftitution
which gave them power over horse racing
and cock fighting ; nor could they inter
fere with rtfpeft to play houses ; and where
they scad no right to legislate, they had no
right to speak at all. As the feflion had
begun harmoniously, he hoped that harmo
ny would not l?e broken in upon by such ap
plications as the present. Mr. P. produc
ed a precedent from the journals of. 17.92,
where a memorial of Warner Mifflin, a
Quaker, after being read, was ordered to.lie
on the table, and two days afterwards re
turned to the memorialist.
Mr. Nicholas felt as much as other gen
tlemerf from the Southern States on the fuhj
jeftof-the present petition, but his feelings
did not produce the fame tffefts. fie was
not afraid of an interference from the United
Stater, with their pfMncrly, nor of any in
vestigations or difcuflions refpefting it. He,
believed it would .be to the honor of the peo
! pie holding property in Slaves, that the
! 'bufi'nefs (honld be look *d into. He thought
; inch an enquiry, would rather ft cure than
iiijure their property. He did not think,
it was the incereil of Slave-holders to cover
improper practices.' He waa fatisfied, that
in tilt part, of tlx; country wheie he lived,
there was no disposition to protest injuries
âno disposition to rejeft an enquiry, pr to
refufe to underftaud a complaint. They
had been told that the state of Negroes,
wKcft cases were mentioned is the Metnor
ial, might have been produced hy, Fugi
tive Law ; they had before heard thut this
law had operated mifchievioufly. ,< It ought
therefore to be enquired into. On enquiry
Mr. N. said, it would not be found the
fault of the Southern States, that Slavery
was tolerated, but their misfortune ; but to
liberate their Slaves at once, would be to
aÂ£l like Madmen ; it would be to injure all
parts of the United States as well as those
who possess Slaves. It was their duty, how
ever to remedy evils; they were unfortun
ately placed in a situation which obliged
them to hold Slavr3, but they did not wish
to extend the mifchief. He (hould, indeed,
be lorry, if his possessing property of this
kind, obliged him to cover the violation of
another man's right; if this werfc the cafe,
he should think /t necefTary that his proper
ty should be taken from him. He did not
think it neceflary, and he doubted not, if a
fair investigation took place, that this kind
of property would be brought into the fito
"atioo in which every man of sense would
place it. He was firmly of an opinioÂ®, that
to appear to be afraid of an enquiry would
do more harm to his property, than a fair
investigation. He trusted, therefore the
Petition would be committed.
Mr. Blount hoped this memorial would
not be committed. As this was not the firft
time the Society of Qiiakers had com â  for
ward with Petitions to the House, seeming
ly with no other view than to fix an odi-um
on the State of N. Carolina, he thought it
his duty positively to contradift a faft ftatcd
in this memorial. It was Hated that 134
persons set free from slavery in N. Carolina',
had been fines enflavedby cruel retrospec
tive, or ex poll fadto laws; they alledged
that certain members of their society - had
done what no person was permitted to do.
Mr. B. read part of a law of N. Carolina,
dating,Â«Â«that 110 Negro or Mulatto Slave
(hall be set free, except for meritorious ser
vices, acknowledged by a licence of the
Court ; and when any person (hall be set
free contrary to this law, he may be fsized
and fold as a slave," See. He also read a
clause from another law palled afterwards,
ftatiog, that feyeral persons having set at
liberty their (laves contrary to law, and per
sons having taken up and fold them, are
doubtful of their validity of the sale, and
that this law is pafied to do away all doubts
of such validity. Mr. B. said, these ex
tracts proved the assertion untrue.
Mr. Gordon lamented that this dis
cussion had .taken place, as it was certain
| that wherever interest is concerned, some
degree of warmth will be produced ; and
when a petition was brought forward which
might affeÂ£t the property of many gentle
men in this hqufe, and their constituents, it
could not be expc&ed they would hear it
with the fame calmuefs with persons wholly
unconcerned about it. He said he had at
tended to every thing which had been said
upon the occasion. All that had been ad
vanced in favor of the second reading of the
petition, was, the rcfpeÂ£iability of the per
sons prefentiiig it, the opinion that would bÂ«
entertained of the petitioner* if their petiti
on was not referred, and the merits of the
petition itfelf. With refped ttf the perfor.s
of the petitioners, he felt inclined to- do
them every justice; but he did not think
this any reason for aft in g upon their memo
rial, iinlefj some good consequence could a
-1 rife from it, any more than if they were the
vilest persons on earth. As to the opinion
that might be entertained out of doors, if
, the petition was not examined, he was not
afraid that the citizens of the United S-.atcs
would believe the house could be so far loft
| to its duty as not to look into a quedion of
tiiis kind, but that it would be conceived,
! if rejected that they had nothing to do with
j it. The ojher reason, the only material
| one, was .as to the merits of the petition.
I The gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Bay
| ard,) who had examined the business with
much cooluefs and ability, had dated that a
certain ex pod fadto law of N. Carolina had
occasioned grievances. Admitting there
was such a law, what could this house do ?
Could they pass a law declaring the law of
N. Carolina null* and void. There would
be no utility in this; but if there'was a law
in N. Carolina that violated theconftitution,
there was a clear remedy in the law .which
organizes the judicial depaitment of the U
nited States, in which it is said, if any law
of an individual State interferes with the
law of the United States, a person has a
right to take advantage of the law of the
United States. I here was -no neceflity,
therefore, to call upon Congress for a re
medy against this law. Indeed, he saw no
thing in this Memorial which called for their
interference, an4he was therefore againlt a
reference, as a fa.ither difeuffion of it would
only produce uneafiuefs in certain paVts 6f
the U. States, without producing any good.
Mr. Rutlf.doe observed, that notwith
standing all that had been said, conGdering
the present extraordinary date of the Welt-
India islands and of Europe, he (liould in!
silt, that " ftjicicnt for the day is tie evil
thereof?' and that thtv oughtto (hut their
door againlt any thing which had a leaden,
cy to produce the like confulion in this conn
try. If this wer? not done, the confidence
of a great part of Union in the general
{jovemment would be weakened. In the
fouiljern dates, where most of their property
cor.lifted of (laves, and where the reit way of
no value without them, there w&s alrfrady a
prejudice esilting that the northern and
Â«a!teru Kates were inftilieal to this kind <.i
property, tnough they were bound by the
constitution from an interfered With it -
but when they heard of the house giving
countenance to a petitipn like'the pWiJsnt
it would increase their uneaGnefs. He re
ferred to what had, fallen from the gentleman
from Delaware, refpe&ing fx poll tafto laws
and thought a ceurt of juftiee the proper
tribunal to fettle the hufinefs. Mr. R.
he was indisposed, notvrithftaridlngtheiiLp, .
nogyrics which had been patted upon tiu
body of Quakers, to withdraw the cenfurts
he had caff upon them. The gentleman
fiom New-York lud doubted the gjiargeswhich lie had produced, and fa-id such things
could never be atteWp;:d by the body. It
was true, they d;d not come in a body into
his lodging .to seduce his servant, but indi
viduals did it. But he alktd, do these
men come here in a body ? Because they
believe that their presence will give more
weight to their petition ; so that they ap
peared in bodies, or as individuals, to ati
fwer their purposes. Gentlemen had charg
ed the oppofers of the petition with heat ;
he thought there was as much heat on one
fide as the other.
Mr. Edmund d d not 'believe there wa3
any real ground ofirritation in this queflion;
as no gentleman could suppose, they were
about to do any thing which was either un
cqn?National, or which would affedt their
property. Whether the persons who pre
sented the memorial are virtuous or vicious,
was of no consequence, since judice was due
to both clalTet of men. They had brought
a petition before them, and they ought to
eonfiderit. It was addressed to their hon
eflry or justice ; if the fafts were claims up
on their honesty or justice, they should be
attended to ; and not only attended to, but
if possible, relief granted.âlt was dated,
that there were a number of persons held in
bondage who were justly entitled to liberty.
This faft called for examinatiou ; and a
queflion arose, if it were eflablifhed, wheth
er that house could afford redress. A gen
tleman from N. Carolina (Mr. Blount) had
stated that the faft was not true ; it was
certainly therefore worth while to beetiquir
ed into. Another gentleman had said, if
the faft were as stated, they had no power
to aft ; and a third was of opinion that, by
the constitution, redress might be afforded.
This diversity of opinion (hewed the neces
sity of an invedigation of the fubjeft, in or
der to determine the jurifdiftion of the
house. Ht wilhed it for another reason.
It had been dated, that if this petition were
/attended to, it would open adoor to faftion
and' mifchief. Can'it have this effeft ? These
peop'e bring forward a petition dating a
number of fafts ; they certainly do not
come forward for the mere design of ex
citing disorder in any quarter. If the
house fay they will throw their petition
under the table, would rot such treatment
give the faftious some ground of clam
pur by which to sow difTentioi ? But
if, on the contrary, they coolly looked
into the petition, and reported thereon, (
would it not stop the mouths of these
people ? It certainly would ; fincc they (
â could not then fay common judice 1 was j
refufed to the petitioners. Again, hav
ing once investigated the fubjeft fully, (
if petitions of a similar kind {hould here- ,
after come forward, it could be reafona- .
bly said, " this matter has already been ,
taken up and fully decided upon, and, |
therefore, we will not again go into it." ,
Until this was done, tl|e faftious would
have cause of complaint.
Mr. Blount said, several gentlemen who (
had spoken on this fubjeft seemed to express (
themselves as if they believed there was no
punishment for persons reducing to Slavery (
persons who hod been manumitted. He j
read an extraft from a law passed in 1779, (
in N. Carolina, by which the punifliment of
â¢ death is awarded againd fueh an offence.
Mr. Macon read the proceedings of the
House on the petition refpefting the kid- ,
napping of Negroes, in order to (hew that (
the Gentlemen from New-York (Mr. Liv- â 
ingdon) had mis-stated issue of that business
the lad report on the fubjeft was, that it | f
would be bed to leave the regulation of jht
business to the Legislatures of the several ,
dates. Mr. M. allowed that his refleftion ,
upon the whole body of Quakers was too ',
general, and he had no hesitation in retrain
ing itâbut he believed a number of them
jvere guilty of the charges btonght againd
them by the gentlemen from S. Carolina. f
Mr. TuaTcbir said, if, when the motion *ai
firfl made he had tern sgninftit, from what had 11
fallen from gmtlemen on the fubjrft, lie (hould 0
now vote In favor of it-'for, notwithstanding ii
they oppof#d the focond r ailing of the peti-ion, c
they were filing off in fqoad* to read it, and ready 1
to fijlt for a Ct;ht ol it. He believed, therefore, ,
they had some relfons for opposing the fceord
r;ading, which did not appear. He referred to
wait had been said hy the gtntleman from N. Ca
rolina, as to th<: UA stated in the petition, and fai J
that notwithstanding the laws which he had read,
the fait might be trueâbut that this very doubt
about the fact was an additional reason for going
into the enquiry. Gentlemen had said, however
good and virtuous the petitioners might bÂ», it
ought to have no effect upon the petitionâif this
were true, he hoped when they wore reprcfentcd
as the intrjl of men, that representation was not â 
meant to influence their decision on the queflion. n
Mr. T. could not conceive for what purpose thay J
were carried to Europe, to wittiefsthefceneswhich j
had taken plac't there for the Mt ten years. Wai
this, heafked, the stats offociety here ? If hetho't
j' 0 'if i t had the fainted resemblance of what was ai
taking placa there, he would fly from it to the ut- t(
termoft parts of the earth, and there make his ha- c
bitation. Mr. T. wilhilhed an enquiry to take
pl ic< . there was a part of the United States in
which (livery was tolerated âsome of the
from those parts thought it not rightâthere was bt
Â«'her parts gÂ£ the Union who disclaimed it. These tk
two ompofing principles were like two oppofitc. ft
powers in Mechanifin, which produced reftâbut .
the more frequently thd fubjea wi, looked into, .

Mr. Bayakd went into a judication of what Jt,

within the ji.rifdiition of the house to afford a n
rcmrdv with refoeA to the expoft fadto law com
ulaified of, 'and 'infifled that, without fomÂ« such

which they could grtno redress. Mr. B. cnnclud- a

1- To the Printers 'of the Connecticut Courant,
J GENTLEMEN,
)t â ' on Â£ cr ago than when the United
States were iti a prosperous fituitiorl rela
i tive to foreign connexions, it was predicted
,s ky the friends to government,' that the pre
nf v alÂ«nce of French liberty and equality'-prin-
Cip! ? in this country, would prove its ruin.
, (This liberty and is better known
is here, by either of the terms, " jacobinism,"
J "democracy," cr "anarchy.") At thr.t
pe*io& < Jl people, but such as were
:â¢ were di'fpofed to
a tW-a'MlwJe'pi-ediaions is chimerical â'or, at
:- the wfei't, if they were ever to be verified,
t it would nut be in their dayâbut at fume
_ very remote period. The found of liberty
i " rneci 't a for'c : e, th'n,; of the Bafi
lilkj capable duJaifg to admira
tion, and the ear of rational moderation, to
f the extreme of eiithufiafm These
r people having enjoyed so great prosperity
under that liberty which the federal canjlihi
f tioA guarantees to them, and not having at
tended to the wide difference which exiils
between the vaunted French liberty, and
the liberty of the United States, they have
gieedily swallowed thf- found for the reali
. ty, and, perhaps, have entertained a jealou
sy of all those whose view? of tha i'ubjedt
: were not correspondent with their o\+n.
Hence they have listened, with perfect cre
dulity, to the vociferous declamations of am
-5 bitious^deroagoguesâhave given full faith
to alltieir'pffertiontâ have been thus induc
ed to believe that 'they were the only true pa
triotsâthal.the federal part of the inhabit
antjofthe United States were British a-
âfriends to monarchyâ
enenTies of the " people"âand combining
in characters ( very thing which is o
dious in society, and hoflile to a republican
government : while they themselves were im
maculate, 8c but one degree fliort of angelic
perfection. Tin's facility of being imposed
upon by such dtiigning men, has its origin
among tliat class of people of which I am
fpcaking, in their virtuous attachment to
real libertyâin their want of repaion until
others itâin their jraloufy for their
own rights, which is always ready to fol
low any direftion that is given itâand in an
honest zeal for others, that they may enjoy
the fame ble flings which are enjoyed by
themfel/es. For a time this defenption Â©f
people will be born away with the ardency
of their feelings. But when their zeal has
had time to coolâ-and reflection begins to
rcfume its power, they will discover their
error, and gradually fettle down into the
right way ; regretting their precipitate fol
ly, and rejoicing at their escapeâis they are
fortunate enough to escape. They will then
doubly execrate the persons who have given
them the alaim, and their confidence be
comes more firmly riveted in those who were
once the odj'pus objeÂ£tÂ« of their diftraft
They adt just like the people of an honest
neighbourhood, who, when they hear a
falfe alarm of fire, hastily seek for the build
ing which it endangered, that they may aid
their brethren in diltrtfs ; but when they
find that no fire has been kindled, and that
the alarm was a falfe one,.their anxiety to
relieve their diftrtflad neighbour, becomes
inflantly converted into a spirit bf vengeance
toward the person who bad thus imposed
upon their quietude.
The United States contain many people
of t|his d.cfcription, and, unfortunately, they
n!fo contain many designing men, who have
been long imposing upon them. Thoy have
cried fireâand the people have runâbut,
thank God, they have at length, found that
no fiie was kindled, except that which was
kindled by those who gave the, alarm. And
since it has become apparent, that these
meu, who called themselves the " men of the
people" republicansâdemocratsâpatri
otsâthe friends of liberty and Franceâ
who, on the contrary have been using eve
ry artifice which interest could prompt to,
and ingenuity suggest, to enlist the people's
zeal 011 their fideâto make them jealous
and diftruftful of their choftn rulersâand,
in fair wards, so to blind them, tha L they
themselves may ride them up to the fu.nmit
of what their real objedt isâthat it is not,
in truth, any regard for the intereftsof their
fellow-citizens which) has actuated themâ
that it is not any real loije ft>r liberty, any ,
further than these objedts may become in
strumental in effecting their own political 1
purposes ; the people, who once placed con- ,
fidence in them, arc beginning to forfake
themâthey are dropping from them one
after another, until, eventually jhey. will be 1
left deflitute of any support, but that which 1
arises from an agreement among themselves, ,
" mutually to support each other."
In Connecticut this is already true to a '
great degree. The support lately given to <
democracy, by the freemen, was coinpara- <
tively small ; and, if they continue to exer- 1
cife that wisdom in future, which they late- â¢
ly evinced, it will shortly bedome extinCt. <
The fame is heginningto bethecafe through- 1
out New-England. Democratic Governors, '
dying - , resigning, or Hegledtld by the free- >
men, are replaced by federal men ; jacobin t
fenatqrs, are omitted for men of opposite
principle?-âand, at the last eleCtion of re
presentatives in Congress, we saw many new
members returned, which threw a majority
iHto the Governmental stale.
Although the counity lifts fuffei"Â«d much
iu cgnfequencc of the artifice mid intrigues
of the ielf-prociaiiÃed " patriot? ;" and
although the predi&iqns.Qf ruin whiph were .!
noticed in the beginning of thii paper were
near to being verified ; yet the people have j
got'ten their eyes opened to the danger, and
they wiljytt.fave their government and coun
trJ' -noO fp isyfotÂ£ s
Many. jjfltliculsts stave confpircd to en
lighten the people. They have seen the in
confiftefncy of the profeffions and characters I
of the Freneh in the United
States. They have seen how frde and per
fidious ehe French hav.e bten to our govern* t
mentâhow falfe r and perfidious they have
been other governmentsâthat while they
have for liberty, they
have in truth been fighting for conqucft and
i f'under. They have seen the'djipiiciiy of
j Thomas Jefferlon, who is at the head of de
a moeracy in the United States'; a'H'd they
- have obfervjd, how p'crfeCtly the coridudt of
1 the otlrer French partisans has tallied, vyi't'i
- h's. They have seen many of the fame class
- of men enliiled on Jioard of French priva
teer;, to capture and , condemn American
1 vefiVls and property. The people of tKc
United States have had time to fee the con.
t duS of S^nliioriaXâof the Spanish minis.
i 'f âof Vidor Ilucruee and of those per
) Â£\>ii3 in this country, who have been loud
t in their praise. Judging, for them floes, of
, the merits of fnch people, and finding them
; far removed from honor or integrity, they
1 naturally co u'luded that those who approve
of their cpr.duCt, whether in this country
or in anojher, mud be of a similar character,
alike dtftitute of honour or integrity. The
convention between General To'ufTaint,
and Santhonax, and the Secretary's refuta
tion of the Spanish miaifter's charges against :
our government, will not soon be forgot- I
ten. They are referred to the true source
French perfidyâand this, in the (tile of dur
" patriots," is " difinierefted friendfhip
That friendfhip which should render the
two republics inseparable. But the picture
of France is too horrid to ever, permanently
charm the feelings of any but true democrts
or jacobins; and wherever there is a tho
rough bred jacobin, there, (mark it my fel
low-citizens) there is at heart, a genuine
tyrant. And, generally, this is compara
tively but a small blemish in his character.
The word democrat, in modern phrase, de
notes every thing that is inimical to the go
vernments both of God and men. I submit
jhe quellion to your reader, if this aflertion
does not accord with their own knowledge.
And fiich, gentlemen, are the men, of all |
the men in the world, who have been deem
ed, by many in this country, worthy to be
entrufled with our dearest rights; worthy
of our unlimited confidence! The
only answer which I know is, because they
themselves fay so.
Such men have long strove, and striven
hard, to throw this country into such a fitn
ation svith respeCt to France* at that they
might themselves engage in the hufinefs of
privateering ; either upon the property of
our enemies, provided they could get ut
conneCtcd in the war with Franceâor upon
our own property, if the French were dis
posed to treat us in an unfriendly manner.
In either cafe, the wishes of the " patriots"
are gratified ; but, unfortunately for my
fellow-citizens, the latter is the cafe ; and
it has been induced, principally, by the in
fluence and falfehoodof our " patriots'." In
stead of patriots we now behold them pica
roons. Instead of honest Americans, they
have become pirates upon American prop
erty. Since the mask is rent asunder, in
stead of that sincere wish to uphold our. own
government, which they have incessantly
proclaimed, we fee them treacherously prac
tising, by every wicked artifice, to destroy
itâto render it subordinate to the promo
tion of felf-interell, and deeming the immo- 1
lalion of their own nation's liberty, profer
ity, and peace, but a small facrifice, when- \
held in competition with personal emolu- <
ment. '
Such, gentlemen, is the real character of -
" democrats"âa cbara&cr which cannot
be too much detestedâa charaCter which
the freedom of the United States will shun
as they wnuld shun pestilential contagion, -
if they intend to preserve the blelfings which f
they now enjoy. '
Perhaps a more favorable time thai! the '
present, e.innot be improved to imprefsthis
fentimcnt strongly upon the minds of the <
freemen of Connecticut. fn a short time <
they are to vote for fix new candidates for 1
congress nomination. Perhaps, as the last '
euort of jacobinism in this state, the French
partisans here, will, like antichrist just he-
fore his destruCtion, make a desperate ftrug- t
gie to support their finking interest. What
direCtien that effort will take, it may be dif
ficult to conjeCtore. Perhaps it will con _
fift in supporting characters for the nomina
tion, which will never become popular, or
such as could not go to congress if they
were chosen ; and thus leave the way more f
clear for the speedy promotion of any fufpi- a
cious ptrfon who may at present be a-candi- -
date. But the freemen of ConneCti'sut, I
think, have gotten their eyes so well open
ed with regard to persons of doubtful poli- 1
tics, that they will be very cautious how
they fall in with such a plan. They will
bring forward other men whose known in- c
tcgrity is worthy of trust, and whose unva- it
rying attachment to the federal government 1
isevineed by their aSions, and not solely by p
their o<wu declarations, furnifhes indifputablc ic
evidenee, that they will not desert the flan- v
dard of their country, nor facrifice the in- y|
terefts of their own nation, to foreigners.
Such and such only, ought to be our candi- ri
dates, and fueh, I trust in God, they will be, Â° !
if the free eleCtors of Connecticut consult
their own interest. Such men exist among
us, and the sagacity of the freemen will find
them out.
