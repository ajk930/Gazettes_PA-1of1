At a numerous and refpeftable meeting
of the citizens of George-Town, held On
Saturday last, agreeably to a previous notice
Col. Lloyd Beall, Mayor, was appointed
Chairman; when the following resolutions
were unanimously agreed to.
Resolved ; that in the opinion of this
meeting ; the Executive of the Un ited
States, in their inftruftions to our Ministers
in France, afford the molt unequivocal evi
dence of a sincere desire to promote and per
petuate an honourablepeace with the French
Republic.
Resolved. that although peace with all
nations is justly dear to this country ; yet
that the preservation of its Honour and In
dependence is the firft national objeft, and
ought therefore to be considered infinitely
more estimable.
Resolved, that this meeting fee 1 it a duty
to express in the strongest terthi, their con
fidence in thewifdom, virtue and patriotism
of the constituted authorities of their coun
try âtheir reliance that at this eventful pe
riod, their deliberations will beinfluenced by

Mungo Parke, the gentleman employed
by the members of the African afTociation,
to explore the interior of' Africa, arrived in
I London on Christmas-Day.
Mr. Parke, we understand, fully confirms
the account given by major Hooghton of
the population and extent of the city of
HoufTa, which lies 011 the great river near
Tombuftoo. From the extraordinary dis
coveries of Mr. Parks, the British merchant
may anticipate vast fonrces of wealth. This
traveller has penetrated tarther into Africa
than any European living. Thf inhabitants
of the city of HoufTa, twice aÂ» large and
twice as populous as London, are exceed
ingly partial to those fpecnrni-us of the F.n
glifh manufadlures which Mr.Parke presen
ted to them.
A new map of England has been pufclifh

intended to be parcelledout whenthe French j
get pofTeffion of the country. This is fell

a vengeance.
The Executive Dire&ory has intimated
to the Kihg of Sardinia, that though by a
former Treaty it was flipulated that his
three fortrefTes of Alexandria, Coni, and
Tortona, should be restored to him at a ge
neral peace on the Continent, circumstances
will not allow them to keep to their engage
ments. We understand that the fortrefs of
Alexandria is to be given to the Cisalpine
Sa B s Culottes.
For the prefenr, we are relieved from ap-;
prehension for the fate of Hamburgh. Ac-'
cording to private letters, it appears thatthe i
French Jacobin CommifSnner, Leonard j
Bourdon, has been charged to demand of'
the Senate three propositions :âFirft, The j
expulsion of the French emigrants from the j
city and territory of Hamburghâwhich
has btfen acceded to. Secondly, The future
prohibition nf thy, iirypaitu-iiiq q(
goodsâwhich has been reftifed tho' it re
mains to be seen how far the Senate will be
able tofdpport its neutrality. Thirdly, The
demand of a Loan, which will probably be
agreed to. Every one knows what is meant
by a French Loan, neither the principal
nor interest of which is ever meant to be
repaid. Happy are the lenders who are not
requited by a Revolution, as has been the
cafe at Genoa, Venice, and other places. On
the 16th. every thing was quift at Ham
burgh, which does nut appear to have been
under any very extraordinary alarm.
The "pcrjiiiiovsaud cruel Cnurtof Rome
What has it done ? defeated a coafpiracy a
gainfl itfelf, in which a French General has
fallen a viftira to the cruel perfidy of Jaco
bininifm, which is plotting and revolting in
every state and city of the Continent.âBut
has it violated the privilegei of the Ambaf
fador'gHotel ? General Duphot was killed'
out of one of the gates,of Rome, whither"
he had been driven aktngwith the Infurgenta
whom he headed.
No wonder the Jacobins throughout the
world cry eagerly for peace. What do they
mean by peacebut thejririfdiSion of a Freneli
Hotel, the head-quarrers of conspiracy,
and the command mi French Generals in
their Infurreftions ?
Thj French Minister for the Home De
partment announced lately, in a letter ad
dressed to the Central admioilhation, the
formation of an efta'blifhment fÂ«ir curing ra
dically every species of madness. Unless
this establishment comprizes the whole ex
tent of the Republic, it will hardly be fuf
ficiently large to contain all the French Re
publicans afflifted with that disease, nor an
swer the purpose of radically curing mad
ness in France.
French Liberty of Speech.
The following passage is extracled fren
tile late Proclamation of the Commissioner
of thÂ« French Direftory at Calais, which
would no daubt better suit the history of the
Inquisition in Spain, than that of a people
who eminently pretend to be free. " Be
sure, Citizens, that Government knows tv
ery thirig, and fees every thing. Private
circles, inns, taverns, ordinaries, nothing
efcapas its vigilance and penetration. Men
may augur fafety from its silence, without
being aware that'this silence maybe ground
ed Â»n the con viftion, that, trulling to their
pretended fafety, the guilty will pufli for
ward in the career of crimes* until at last
they surrender themfrlves into the hands of
justice. Ye, too, will render yourselves
criminal, who fuffer an unconftitutionaPlan
guage to be held in your houfeswithout de
nouncing it. Informed of this iueivifm,
the Dire&ory will cause those to be brought
to punifhmcnt who do not denounce their
neighbours-"
Surely there was 00 occasion topull down

the ancient police of Paris,, if they were to
be replaced by a code which authorizes pro

Captain sir Sidney Smith.
Mr. Hafkiffon, after contrasting the dif
ference of treatment between French pri
soners here and 'BriiiJh prifoncrs in France,
drew the attention of the hoiife to the con
dition of the gallant Sir Sidney Smith, who
â Was yet confined in a solitary dungeon, and
exposed to every want, <1 ifgraae, ignominy
and insult. In order to shew that it was
our wilh to alleviate, and that of the French
i to aggravate the calamities of war, he mov
ed that there be kid before the house a co
py of the correspondence with the French
commissioners relative to the exchange and
treatment of Sir Sidney Smith.
Captain Berkley seconded the motion.
He lamented the absence of those gentle
men who had so pathetically addrefled the
house on the imprisonment of La Fayette.
The cruelty of the French to his brother
officer Sir Sidney Smith, was beyond all
example in civilized states. Had these gen
tlemen who expressed so much feeling for a
foreigner with whom they had no concern,
; no feeling fog. the gallant officers of their
: country ? He agiin lamented the absence
! of the patriotic he had alluded
! to, but he hoped their absence was occafi
j oned byr shame and contrition. He hoped
j those gfntlemen would shew as much hu
| manity for their countrymen fighting their
battles, as they had formerly done for the
enemies of their country !
Colonel Stanley slated his personal know

Thursday, April 19.
Tlie House being in a committee oftliÂ« whol?
on the state pj the union, Mr. Ukn r in tii^
chair, oil the bill to provide an add^toutiiftr*
maauwtt for the protection of the
trade of the Umtcd States, and for other
pnrpof'es.
[Concluded from our lap. J
Mr. Gai,i,Ati\ believed it woold now bÂ«
in Older to renew the queitiwn whkjfc had been
waved, with respect to the employment of
these veflels. He should, therefore, in order
to bring this fubjecl tinder view, more an a
inendment in tly firft feÂ£tion of the bill,
nearly in the fame words as the one which had
at firft been adopted by the house at the last
session in the bill relative to the equipping and
fitting for sea the frigates, viz. " provided
thef fiiall not, in time of peace, be employed ai
convoys to tiny foreign port or place." The
wjcrds " in time of peace" were not in the a*
nfendment of last yepr ; but as he conceived
that tlie veflels authorised to be procured by
this bill, were either to be employed for the
defence of our coast and ojtr trade within our
jurifdiclion, in the present state of things, or
for general purposes of atiack and dc'fencc iri
cife of war, he wished only fiich amendment
to be adopted as would be proper in either
cafe. If there was war, let the 1 vellels be ap
plied in the >noft efficient way; but if they
were intended tc> be nfed as eonvoys under
our present circilmftances, he was govng to
(late that such ah employment woitlci inevita
bly change present fta-fe of things.
But before he took, this ground, lie woultf
make fasie obfervatiofis on the rÂ«al advanta
ge* chill might refflit frayn employing theft
vellels as COnvdys ill the actual ttaie of things,
supposing even it was not Â»-hangetl hyTh*t em
ployment. Whoeverhadcontidered the ex
tent of our coast, and the nature Â©f ourtrade.
must be convinced that 11 (hips cannot be
employed to any great purpose as convoys.
To what part of the Globe were they to be
convoys ? To the Well-Indies, or to Eu
rope > It could not be intended to convoy
vessels from our own ports to an European
port with these vessels ; it could not be sup
posed that they would be able to cope with
vetfels of war in the European seas. Tile
object of this convoy, then, must be our ves
sels to the Weft-Indies. But he asked whe
ther this force would be fufficieilt for that
purpose, or whether the trade to the Weft
indies was offuch a nature as to be suscepti
ble of being convoyed ? There are a varie
ty of fmatl ports in the Weft-Indies, and
merchants endeavour to take advantage of the
best markets j their vessels, therefore, fail
singly and not in companies. He believed
the only use to which these vefTels could be
applied with any effeÂ£t so as to protect our
trade, would be by attacking privateers to
drive them from the coast ; but this was by
all agreed to be an act belonging to an attuai
state of war in which we were not yet plung
ed.
As to the right of convoy in Neutral Nati
ons, it was a right at lcaft of a doubtful na
ture. He believed it had been exercised ;
but not in an.effeitual manner, except bv
iim itimr-rvrcr; tire TjeTTige
rent powers were unwilling to provoke
them ; but wherever belligerent powers were
riot afraid of being involved in war with the
nations employing fueh convoys, Ihey have
dilregarded them. This fail was elucidated
by the Armed Neutrality, which on account
of the maritime ffrength of the Powers con
cerned and of the apprehensions of Grea'-
flntain was theq refpefted But the puxtii
convoys never were regarded by the Bririfh
and Mr. G. quoted an inflance where a whole
Dutch fleet and convoy were taken into port
by the Englifli whÂ» at that time were at peace
with them.
But the qlieftion with him, Mr. G fa : d
was not so much the right, as the policy of
the measure. Supposing that neutral powers
have a right to grant convoys to their trade
the object of filch a convoy, according to the
sea 1011 of the bill which had beefl ft ruck out,
was " to secure and .maintain the independent
rights of commerce an.l navigation which
the lawsoi nations and the ItipiiUtionsVf trea
ties acknowledge and faction." This must
be the objeft ot'eonvoysin time of peace, ard
the question was, whether it would be good
pol.cy to grant ac< ' oy to secure these rights.
Wejuiow, that, in (he present cafe, aIT the
belligerent powers have not only violated th<>
laws ot nations, but ftijHilations of treaties â¢
and to attempt to fecurc these rights by con
voys, is precifelv to fay, we mean to smploy
violence to repel tlrcfe aggretlions; it is to all
intents aT.d purposes to go to war. It is not
thu cafe in the present European war, as in
common wars, that the laws of nations and
treaties are toterably tfell refpetted by the
different belligerent powers. In this war
both the belligerent powers have declared
from the begin,ling, they would not refpecc

count he had before declared, that Fran-a
had given us just cause os-war ; but if Con
gress do not think proper to go to vuir. ihey
ought not to grant these vessels as convov/,
which would be iÂ» fact war.
The question is, whether we shall bear with
the lofTes which must result from capture in
the present state or things, or refill them with
force and war ? *
Mr. G. said he knew the question of wrr
did not depend altogether upon this country
He knew that it was pollible that within three
months we might be in a state of war â¢ and if
the house thought it to have the
veflejs built to be ready to meet such a ftat~

He had said that from the beginning of th
prefent European war, the belligerent pavers
had set alide the laws of nations and ftipula

{Volume XIII.F ranee had also behaved in a dill more extra
ordinary manner. It was immaterial, in the
present conflderation, to enquire whether
Great. Britain or France was the firlt to break
the laws of nations ; the faÂ£t is, that all the
different belligerent powers have at times in
fringed them ; and even the last arrivals from
Europe bring accounts (which though not
official, carry every appearance of being true)
of inftruttions given to the commanders of
British vessels of war, which are direÂ£t viola
tions of the laws of nations and of treaties.
It it true, that at present the infringements
of the laws of made by France are
vastly more oppreflive, and in their conse
quences far mors extensive and injurious to
our trtfSÃ than those of any othernation ; but
it is not less true, that until we do deem these
infringements fufficitnt cause of war, we
ought not to enter into any meaftires which
will in their effeCts amount to the fame thing
as aÂ£tual war. To grant convoys is such a
measure ; and before that is done, it ought
to be confiflered \yhether in a date of war, We
should be in abetter foliation than at present.
Mr. G. was aware be should at once be met
with an exclamation, What I Will you not
protest our commerce i Are you not bound
to protect jt ? So far as this complaint was
considered in a local point of view, he tho't
it unfounded. He had heard it said, and re
peated, that those stateS which are more com
mercial than others, would not quietly fit
down under the negleCt, if protection was not
given to commerce. So far as'relates to the
eadem dates, he believed they had no greater
reason to complain than foine other dates on
this ground. Wliilft on this floor, Mr. G,
/aid, he torfidered himfelf as a reprefentatiye
of the whole union, and bound to attend to
the protection and to the interests of every
part of the United States; but if the matter
was to be considered on local ground, the
middle states had as.g'reat right to complain
as the eastern; and therefore no reasons of lo
cality could induce him to give the vote
which he proposed to give, since the state of
Pennsylvania and New-York have as much
interest in commerce as the eastern (fates. The
total ainouAt of the tonnage of the fyur east
ern ftjtes employed in foreign trade is 248,000
tons, an,d that of the states of Pennsylvania
and New-York 195,000. Thereprefentation
of the eastern flares on this floor, compared
with the dates of New-York and Pennsylva
nia (which was the bed criterion of their' re
speCtive population) is as 27 to 23, and the
proportion of foreign tonnage betwixt them
is as 27 to 2ii. Tjiere was therefore no sen
sible difference between them
The question was, which was the bed way
of protecting our trade, in our present folia
tion. Government was bound to protect all
its citizens, in whatever occupation they
ohufe to follow ; but its power of proteftion
is redraincd to a certain extent. In this in
flance, indead of convoys protecting our
trade, they will be the destruCtion of it ; for,
.if by Â«ny aÂ£t of ours, war is produced our
trade would be in a worse situation than at
present, bad as it is.
But he would examine to what extent our
present injuries go, and how convoys would
apply.
Convoys were to apply more fpecifically in
two cases, viz. where a seizure was attempt
ed for want of a role d'equipage, or wheÂ«e, ac v
cording to the late French decree, our vessels
have Briiifli manufactures or produce on
board. He had never examined to fee how
far the demand with respeCt to the role d'equi
page was an infringement of our treaty with
France. He had taken it for granted that
if it were juftified by our treaty, it was
now made a mere pretext for seizure, *be
caufe our treaty had been in force since the
commence of the war, and this ground had
never been taken till lately. But upon this
fubjefl, he would observe, that almod all the
mifchief which could be done had been done,
fornAUV ut ifurfi y1 jy ay Oln vciTtrnrCcrcrtil
now always furnifh themselves with themj
lie did not think it necefl'ary, therefore, to
grant convoys for this purpose.
So far as relates to British manufactures be
ing good prize, he agreed with the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) that we oughts
to take into consideration the extent of our
trade to that country, not only our export
trade, but our returns from thence. Thesf
feCt bf the French decree will be either to
raise the price of infuranc.e much higher upon
our own veflels, or the carrying trade will be
carded on in Britifli vessels. But great as
would be, he believed it would be
better to bear with them than go to war.
The only evil n one inltance will be, that the
confumcr will ihave to pay the additional rate
of insurance, and lie would much rather do
this tlutn change our present situation. For
in cafe of war, not only all British manufac
tures will be equulfy liable to captures ; but
all our trade will be in the fame situation.
And wi'l any gentleman fay, that there will
be less captures on #ur trade in a state Of war,
than in our present Itate ? Is it to be supposed
â¢that these twelve vessels, with the three fri
gates, and all the vessels we can build and
inan, will proteCt.our trade, so as to reduce
our captures below their present number ?
He not. He believed that in a state
of war, more captures would be made, as not
only the vessels which are now captured under
different pretences, would still be captured,
but that part of our trade which now escapes
capture, will then befeized.
- The amount of our exparts, Mr. G. said,
was 51 millions. Out of those 51 millions,
84 are feut to Great-Britain. Though this
is the amount, according to the statement
from the propei depaitment, the gentleman
from S. Carolina (Mr. Harptr) has said, that
considerable quantities of goods sent to the
British Weft-Indies, have been entered at the
cultom-houje as for the French Weft-Indies,
in order to avoid capture ; but it had also
been stated by a gentleman who mud be sup
posed to be better acquainted with commer
cial fubjefls than him (Mr-S. Smith) that
full as many goods were entered forthe French
Weft-Indies, intended forthe English, as in
the other cafeT It was, at all events, only an
assertion, which ought not to lessen the cre
dit of an official statement.
On the other hand, it appears by this efti
niate, that to the amount of 25 millions of
dollars is exported to France, Spain and Hol
land. This, in cafe of war, will doubtless be
cut off. And if we are not at liherty to export
that portion ofour produce thither, what mud
be done with it ? The only country to which we
shall have a free trade will be Great-Britain
The effeCt ot this will be, to fink the price of
our produce ; because the whole is not want
ed and cannot be confomed in Great-Britain,
and die ii flint out from those ports to which
we now fend it. Independent, therefore, of
additional captures, that immense American
tonnage, which it is intended to protect,
would at once be reduced to one tlurd of
what it now is, for want of a market for our
produce.
Nay, in addition to these 25 millions, our
trade to the Hanfe Towns will also be de- 1
ftroyed, as it is well known w hat was the situ
ation of Hamburgh, so that, in cafe of war,
the whole of ottr trade will be cut off, except
â 4) millions to Great-Britain and her domini. 1
I* ons, and a few millions to Sweden and Den- i
mark. He could not, therefore, fee, how the |
granting of a convoy could protect pui(coni
merce, wheu the effect tniifl be war, which
will deftTOy it.
The gentleman from S'. Carolina (Mr.
Harper) yederday told the committee, that
the effeCt of not granting convoys would be,
to give the whole of our carrying trade to
Great-Britain. He wished to know, if this was
to be the effeCt of not granting convoys, what
would be the effeCt of war ? The moment we
go to war, we give to Great-Britain the whole
of our trade. But the gentleman went on to
I tell the committee, what France would fay to
this country next, if we did not resist her.
I He (aid die would tell uÂ«, You diall no longer
go to Hamburgh, or to any other place at
which you get money for your produce, be
cause you will pay that money to G. Britain
for her manufactures. If this would be the
1 cafe, jn we declined granting convoys,
he wiftied t)) know what would be the effect
'offcrafr? Was it expected that France would
give more latitude to our trade in cafe of ac
tual war than at present (
When gentlemen spoke of the immense in
crease of our tonnage from 450,000 to 800,000
tons, did they consider to what this increase
was owing? it hasbeen pwing to our neutra-
has taken place during the present Euro
pean war. whilst the tonnage of Great-Britain
employed in the trade oLthis country, has by
the effect of that war, drcreafed from 206,000
tons, which it was in 1792, to 19,600, which
it was by the last returns at the end of 1796. i
Seeing, therefore, that notwithstanding all
the captures mafle of our vessels, our tonnage
has increased from year to year ; in order to
save that valuable tonnage, and to afford eve- !
ry pofiible protection to it, if that was the on
ly objeft of the house, they mufl wish the pre
sent date of things to subsist in preference to
a state of war, and mtift therefore refrain from
taking steps which cannot fait to produce war.
It was not only his opinion that the grant
ing of convoys wÂ»uld lead to war. The point
has been conceded. For what did the gen
tleman from S. Carolina (Mr. Harper) state
convoys were wanted ? He said they were
wanted against the depredatory decrees of the
Frenchâthe role d'equipage and the decree
making veflels with British manufactures on
board, legal prize. He said it was to resist
these decrees. He went farther, he said, they
ought to be resisted at the mouth of the can
nun. If.capture was to be resisted at the meuth
of the cannon, without war, he ccruld not un
derltand it. If he understood the gentleman
from Maffaclmfetts (Mr. Otis) he went still
farther, and said that he would resist aJearch.
And certainly the.moment a principle of this
fort was a (Turned, it was nothing more or left
than war. Unless indeed fouie unintelligible
metaphysical distinCtion should be attemped
betwixt./fgAÂ«'Â»Â£and toar. It, then, it is better,
as a matter of calculation, to be in the present
ftateof things than at war) were there any
other considerations, which ought to set aside
this matter of calculation ? The committee
were told by the gentleman from S. Carolina,
that if we did not resist, France would go on
Itep byftep, in her course of aggredions against
this country. This is mere matter of specu
lation. It is poflible France may go 011 in this
way. if (he goes on to make war upon us,
then let our veflels be used in their full pow
er. Let us not, however, said he, ait on spe
culative grounds ; but examine our prelent
situation, and if better than wiir, let us keep
it.
The committee have been told, that this
doCtrine, is a doCtrine ot fubmiflion. The
gentleman called war by the name of resist
ance, and they gave the appellation Â»f abjeCt
Ã¼bmiflitn to a continuance of forbearance
under our present losses and captures. He
affixed a different idea to the word fubmiflion.
He would call it fubmiflion to purchase peace
with moneyâhe would call it fubmiffien ts
stvcui fee fgnmiiinious terms of peaceâhe
would call it fubmiflion to make any acknow
ledgments unworthy of an independent coun
try. He would call it fubmifhon to give up
by treaty any right which we possess. He
would call it fubmiflion to recognize by treaty
any claim contrary to the laws of nations.
But there is a great difference betwixt surren
dering by treaty our rights and independence
as a nation, and faying, " We have met with
captures and losses from the present European
war; but as it is coming to a close, it is not
our interest to enter into it, but rather to go
on as we have done." This, he thought,would
be awife course, and extremely different from
a state of fubmiflion.
The committee had been told of a spirit of
money as improper, and that it ought to be
set artde. 1c speak of expence is no proof
of that magnanimity, national honour, and na
tional spirit, which have enabled other nations
to repel their enemies. He did not think the J
indances quoted by the gentleman from S.
Carolina were happy. He had quoted France,
and faid,thatit was because she had set aside
every other consideration but the neceflity of '
supporting the war; because she had difre- !
garded every thing like property and deluged ,
her own country with blood, that she had ,
been fticcefsful. t J
Mr.G.hadno objedlion that France might ba
adtaced as an example ter-lead us to repet aoy ,
enemy which may attempt to invade us ; but ,
in her disregard for property, in her confif- !
cations, and requisitions in those measures !
which have had conquest and plunder, and
not refiftasicCj for their object; and above all '
in the deluge of blood that had been died for y
the fakÂ« of ambition, or caprice, or faction, he J
truded never would be set up as a proper mo
del for this country. 1
The indances of Rome and Athens, which J
the gentleman adduced, were not more hap- *
py. He did not think the spirit of conquest, 1
which animated the firft, the spirit of plunder *
towards every other independent date of
Greece which adhiated the last, the lust for a
power which characterized both, to be that
spirit which would be bed calculated to pro â¢ 0
mote the happiness of America.
Mr. G. concluded by faying, that he meant *â 
to have gone further into a consideration of
what was call;d a spirit of fubmiflion, and to v
have drawn some comparisons between out 1
present date, and what it had been in foma t'
stages of the European war j but finding the 0
usual hour ot adjournment past, he would for- e
bear to do it at present. He then recapitu- f'
lated his arguments, and fat down. c
Mr. Dayton (the speaker) expressed an ear- si
nest w-ifh that the committee of the whole n
ftiould rife, and have leave to fit again, not so
much forthcfakeoffurtherdilcuflingtheme- r.

bers an opportunity the dangerous a
and fatal tendency of the arguments adduced
in the support of it. Feeling as-he did, upon ts
the occalion, it would be almost criminal in h
him to forbear to declare, that he had beard p
with astonishment, and he had almost said, ai
with indignation, the speech to which they ft
had been lideniug, from the member ftbm C
Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin.) He had never f<
expeited to have heard such tame and fob- hi
raiflive language, within the walls of CongrtfÂ» tli
and from a representative of the American peo- th
pie, at a time too when they were (marring uiÂ»- bl

n- which his iWtriaes were in (lireft hollUity, ye:
ch he surely cou'd not have so faon forgotten
the tenor and spirit of the dispatches
lr. from our commiHioners in Paris. Tha' this
lat fpeeeh had been prepared before the receipt of
le, tlrofe dispatches was by no means improbable,
to but that it fiiould be uttered thus openly and
as bold!/, after those important communications
lat had been piibliftied to tbp, world, was indeed
Â»e surprizing. If it were a motion in order in that
>le body, Mr. Dayton declared that lie ihould itr
to mediately move that it be printed, and that
to copies (hould not only be given to every mem
:r. ber, but as .far as poflible to all the citizens of
;er the United States, that they might all, as with
at one voicedifclaim the principles which it tend
e- cd to nculcate.
lin Mr. Nisholas hoped the committ#Â« would
he rife, that the gentleman from New-Jersey might
's, have an given to him to state, in
what this ipeech was so extraordinary, which
Id would be much more conformable to Ifgiflative
c- procetdings, than making denunciations in ge
neral terms. *

The best method of exprefling our indigna-

hsvejuft heard from the gentleman from Penn

lit still and decide the question. Sir, when I fee

J n ember of the comnaittre, as he believed it re
-1 pugnant tÂ« thtf'feetings of the American people,
yet he thqugtit .bis fpeeeh ought not to jjo un

II an extraordinary one in the year 177J, and if
i the sentiments contained in it had been adopt
jÂ° ed, our revolution wotrfd never have been ae
complilhed. He hoped, therefore, that the coin
le mittee would rife, that arguments which would
j lead to a surrender of the peace and iÃdepen
dence of this country to a foreign nation, might
\[ be refilled.
Mr. Macon hoped -the committee would
[ e rife, for the reasons afiigned by the gentleman
;e last up, because if the fpeeeh of the gentleman
j from Pennsylvania was such as he stated it to
n Â» he wished to hear it exposed. It had flruck
(j him very differently.

that he felt as mtith opposition to the opinions
i. of his colleague as any gentleman could do ;
it but he did nor his of fuÂ«h impor.
p tance that the committee Ibould fit another day
to anfv;er it. He believed the answer to it, was
is to !>efound in the late dispatches of our Envoys,

believed the titn? was come, when instead of

1- what it was in the fpeeeh of the gentleman from

h high a degree of indignation ia eeitain gentle
n men of the committee. For his part, he owned
't the gentleman from Pennsylvania had engaged
0 his rnoft feninus attention ; and if that gentle
d nsjn was culpable, he was equally so, for he ap
-11 probated every sentiment which he delivered.
< He thought it one of the molt temperate dif
' cufiions he had ever heard, being free from par
e fonalitits, and, as it struck him, of any expref
' lion which could excite irritation in any one. If
- when a gentleman rises on the floor of this house,
s on a great and important questionâon a quef
s tion on which perhaps depend thrp-aceand :nde- :
â¢ peadence of the csuntryâhe is to be treated in '
> this manner-, there is an end to all freedom of i
debate. He mull own, he had never, on any |
oecjfisn, seen so much indectÃcy of condudl as 1
7 had been thtwn towards the gentleman from
1 PennTylvaftia, for having delivered sentiments, 1
which, in his opinion, did honour both to the (
head and heart of that gentleman.
* M*. D*na wifhtc the rnÂ«nmittÂ«< to rift. â j
[ When he refle&td that the gentleman from
New-Jersey was a native American, and had ]

j lution, he coild not be furprnted at the indig
j nation which he fett'on thi# occasion ; but he v
r wilhed the committee to rife, in order to lhow c
, that the gentleman had perverted the fenfeof the r
laws of nations. A* to his arguments to prove c
that it would be mere our to fubmitto,
t than to refill the terms offered to us by France, â¢
he believed the answer which our envoys re-
turned to the agents of the French government, 11
' would also be a complete answer to them.
Mr. Gallatin said he did not mean to make t
any kind of observations upon what had fallen 1<
from the member from Conneiflicut (Mr. Allen) t
. or the Speaker ; he meaot only to notice what
had been said by the gentleman laft\p from
t Conneflicut, who had perverted his sentiments. 1
That gentleman had said, that his observations c
would find an answer in the reply of our envoys d
to the agents ef Talleyiand, thereby fignifyiug, a
1 that he Mr. G.had eapreffed hisnfelf in favour d
. of an acceptance of such terms as had been off- c
ered to our envoys. That gentleman could not
surely have attended to what he had said; be- [
cause he had expressly stated, that he Ihould con- ''
fider it as fubmifiion ta pay to that nation any P
money, or to recogniae any claim contrary to
1 the law of nations ; but he had said, he would 1
rather fubmu to our present captures, under the so
hope that they might not have a long tontlnu- â¢â¢
ance, than take a measure whith was war. ' 1
He would jufl add, that the Speaker was mis- &
taken when he stated that the fpeeeh which he 0
had delivered wa| prepared befdre the late dif- ei

l' THE STAND âNo. VII.
The difp-itches from our envoys have at
t . length made their appearance. They pre
. feut a picture of the French government ex
t ceeding in turpitude whatever was anticipat
- ed from the previous intimations of their
contents. It was natural to expeft, that
1 the perusal of them would have infpirtd a
universal sentiment of indignation and dif
j gull ; and no man, calling hmiCelf an
t American, ,ri W>\jld have had the hardihood
1 to defend, oÂ» even to palh'ate a conduft so
' atrocibus. But it is already apparent, that
: an ex{)e&ation of this kjnd would not have
been well founded.
I There are flrong symptoms that men in
. power in France understand better than our
selves the true charafter of their fa&ion in
this country, at lead of iti leaders ; and
that as to these, Via agents who conferred
with our envoys, were not mistaken in pre
' dicing that the unreasonableness of the de-
I mands upon us would not serve to detach
the party from France, or to re unite them
to their own country. The high-prifft of
this fed, with a tender regard for the honor
of the immaculate directory, has already
' imagined several ingenious diftinftiois to
iefcte them from the odium and corruption
unfolded by the dispatches. Among'thefe
is the fuggeftioti that there is no proof of
the privity of the dire&oryâall may have
been the mere contrivance of the minifler
for foreign relations.
The prefunption from so mifcrable a sub
â¢ terfuge is, that had the proportions proceed
ed immediately from the dire&ory, the cry
from the fame quarter would have beenâ
there in no'eridence that the councils or na
tion approved of them ; they at lead are
not implicated ; the friendlhip of the two
republics ought not to be disturbed on ac
count of the villainy ,ps the transitory and
fugitive organs of one of them. The in
ventor of the fubterfuge however, well knew
that the Executive organ of a nation never
' comes forward in person to negotiate with
foreign ministers ; and that unless it be pre
sumed to direst and adopt what is done by
its agents, it may always be ftieltered from
rafponfibility or blame. The recourse to so
pitiful an evasion, betrays in its author a
fyftematie design to excuse France at Â«11
eventsâto foften a spirit of fubmifiion to
every violence she may commitâand to pre
pare the way for implicit fubjeftion to her
will. To be the pro-consul of a despotic
directory over the United States, degraded
to the condition of a province, can alone
be the criminal, the ignoble aim of so sedi
tious, so proltitute a character.
The subaltern mercenaries go Hill farther.
Publications have appeared, endeavoring to
juftify or extenuate tha demands upon our
envoys, aod to inculcate the slavish doftrine
of cjmpliance. The United States, it is
said, are the aggreflors, and ought to make
atonement; France affiftcd them in their
revolution with loans, and they ouÂ§ht_to_
- JT a boon
worth the price required for it, and it ought
to be paid. In this motley form, our coun
try is urged to fuifc voluntarily, and with
out a struggle, to a state of tributary vas
salage. Americans are found audacious and
mean enough to join in the chorus of a fo
reign nation, which calls upon us to barter
our independence for a respite from the lalh.
The charge of aggression upon the Unit
ed States is falfe ; and if true, the repara
tion, from the nature of the cafe, ought
not to be pecuniary. This species of indem-.
nification between nations, is only proper
where there has been pecuniary injury.
The loans reeeived by us from France
were a/ked as a favor, on condition of re
imbursement by the United States; and
were freely granted for a purpose of mutual
advantage. The advances to be made by us
were exa&ed as the price of peace. Though
in name loans, they would be in fad contri
butions, by the coertion of a power which
has already wreftcd from our citizens an im
mense property, for which it owes to them
compensation.
To pay such a price for peace, is to pre
fer peace to independence. The nation
which becomes tributary takes a master.*
Peace is doubtless precious, but it is a bau
ble compared w"ith national independence,
which includes national liberty. The evils
of war to refill such a precedent, are infig
nificant, compared with the evil of the pre- ;
cedent. Besides that there could be no pof- j
fible security for the enjoyment of the ob- j
jest for which the difgraceful facrifice was i
made.
To difguiie the poison, raifreprefenta
tion is combined with fophiflry. It is al
ledged, that finally no more was aflced than '
that the United States Ihould purchfcfe, fix- 1
teen millions of Dutch inferiptions, and '
that by doing this, they would have fe- 1
cured compensation to their citizens for '
depredations on their trade to four times the '
amount, with an intermission of the depre
dations ; that no hazard of ultimate loss I
coukl have attended the operation, because '
the United States owed thet)Utch a much '
larger sum which would be a pledge for 1
payment or discount. i
This is a palpable, attempt to deceive. I'
The firft propositions were such as have :
been represented i'Â« a former paper , but
it appears witbe-fequel, that the French a- 1
gents feeing the inflexible opposition of 1
our envoys to their plan, and hoping to *
efctort finally a considerable sum, though J
* The argument of what haÂ» been done io the cases t
ot Alceri-njs and Indians, has nothing pertinent <â 
but in the comparison of relattve ferocity. In this
view, tiic {claim of the Directory it iodifputable
bat in e.eiy other it is prrpotlereu*. Jt is the gene
ral practice of civilized nacioDS'tc pay barbariansâ 1
itKre is no point of honor to the contrary. Hut be- 1
iween civilized nation.,, the payment of tribute by *
one to another, is by the common opinion ut man-
Kind, a badge of servitude. 1
: lefsthan at firft contemplated, relaxed so
[ far in their demands as to narrow them
' down to the payment of a douceur of twelve
hundred thousand livres with a positive en.
gngement to advance to the F-iench govern
â¢ ment a sum equal to the amount ef the
spoliations of our trade, and a further en
gagement to fend to our government tor
power to purchase of France thirty two
- millions of the infcriptibns (12,800,000
. dollars) in return for all which, our envoys
. were to be permitted to remain fix months
- in Paris, depredations on our trade, duriDg
that time, were to be suspended, and a
1 commission of five persons was to be ap
. pointed to liquidate the claims for past de
predations which were to be fatisfied "in a
time and manner to be agreed upon." The
substance of these demands is to pay imme
diately twelve hundred thousand livres and
to bind ourselves to pay absolutely twenty
millions of dollars more (the ellimated a
mount ofithe spoliations) for what bare
ly for the acknowledgment 'of a debt to our
citizens, which without it, is not th 6 f> j fs
due, and for a suspension of hojlilities * for
fix months.
Afterwards, in a converfatfon between
the French minister himfelf and o e of our
envoys, the prOpositions afftimed another
form. The United States were required
to purchase of France par fixteeii mil.
lions of inscriptions, and to promise fur
ther aid when in their power. This arrange
ment being JirJl made and not- before, France
was to take measures for reimbiirfing the
equitable demands of our citizens on ac
' count of captures.
The purchase of the mfcriptions was to
be a preliminary. The arrangement for
rcimburfing our merchants was to follow.
The nature of it was not explained ; but
it is to be inferred from all that preceded,
that the expedient of the advance of an e
qual sum by the United States would have
been pre/ Ted as the bafts of the promised ar
rangement. This la ft proposal was in its
principle; as bad as either of the former ;
in its tendency worse. The promise of fu
ture affi (lance would have carried with it
the privilege to repeat at pleasure the de
mand of money, and to dispute with us a
bout our ability to fupplv ; nr.d it would
have embarked us as an ajjociate with France
in the war. It was to promise her the
most efFedtual aid in our power, and that of
which ihe flood most in need.
The scheme of concealment was a trick*
The interest of France to engage us in the
war against Great-Britain, as a mean of
wounding her commerce, is too strong to
have permitted the facret to be kept by her.
By the ratification of the treaty, in which
the senate must have concurred, too many
would have obtained possession of the se
cret to allow it to remain one. While it
did, the apprehension of discovery would
have enabled France to use it as an engine of
unlimited extortion. But a still greater ob.
je&ion is, that it would have been infamous
in the United States, thus covertly to re
liuquifh their neutrality, and with equal
cowardice and hypocrisy to wear the mafic
of it, when they had renounced the reali
ty-
The idea of fecurinw otir- advances, by
- -means ol Ihe flebt "which we owe to the
Dutch is without foundation. The credi
tors of the United States are the private
citizens of the Batavian republic. Their
demands could not be ' p, JO fed by a claim
of our government upon their government.
The only shape in which it conid be at
tempted must be in that of reprisals for tte
delinquency of the government. Bu' this
would not only be a grefs violation of the
principleâit would be contrary to expreft
stipulations in the contrasts for the loanvf-. '
fame fpiiit of deception, it has
alio been alledged that our envoys by giving
the douce in- of twelve hundred thousand li
vres . gnd agreeing to fend for powers to
make a loan, might have obtain-* d a suspen
sion of depredations far fix months. There
is not a syllable in the dispatches to coun
tenance this assertion. A large advance in
addition, either on the basis of the spolia
tions, or by way of purchase of the inferip
tions. is uniformly made the condition of#
suspending hostilities.
Glosses so falfe and as these, i n
a crisis of such immiment public danger, to
mifiead the opinion of our nation concern*
ing the conduct and views of a foreign ene
my, are shoots from a very pernicious trunk.
Opportunity alone is wanting to uuveil the
treafQn which lurks at tha core.
What fignifies the quantum of the con
tribution, had it been really as unimportant
as is reprfifented ? 'Tis the principle which
is to be refilled at every hazard. 'Tis the
pretension to make ustributary,in oppofitiou
to whicheveryAmerican ought to resign the
last drop of his blood.
The pratings of the Gallic faftion at this
time reminds us of those of the Britifti fac
tion at the commencement of our revoluti
on. The infignificance of a duty of three
pence per pound on tea was echoed and re
echoed as the bait to an admiffibn of the
right to bind ne in all cases whatloever.
The tools of France inceflantly clamor a
gainst the tresty with Britain as the just
cause of the resentment of France. 'lt is
curious to remark, that in the conferences -
with our envoys this treaty was never once
mentioned by the French agents. Particu
lar passages in the speech of the President
are alane fpecified as a ground of difiatis
fa&ion. This is at .once a specimen of the
fruitful versatility, with which causes ofcohi
plaint are contrived, and of the very flight
foundations on which they are adopted.â
A temperate expreflion of sensibility at an
outrageous indignity, offered to our gov
ernment by a member of the Dire&ory, is
converted intQ a {[mortal offence. The ty
* It'it sbfcrnfelf Thir the French give t(irrafclvÂ«s
thcdcnrniinuicn of LirtES 'o their depreda
t'oits upon us. Our Jacobins would have us eotifiiier
tbem is gentle cart iles;
+ They at) p; avide against feizbre or fequtftriiim
by way of repufajs, &c.rants will not cpdure a murmur at the blows,
they infliÂ£l.
But the dispatches of our envoys, while
they do not fan&ion the charge preftrred by
the Gallic faftion against the treaty, confirm
a very serious charge which the friends e*f
the government bring against that fa<3ion.
They prove, by the unreserved coufeffion of
her agents, that France, placed abfolutc de
pendence on this party in every event, and
counts upon their devotion to her as an en
couragement to the hard conditions which
they attempt to impose. The people of
this country mull be infatuated indeed, if
after this plain cotifeflion they are at a loss J
for the true source of the evils they fuffered j
or may hereafter fuffer from the despots of
Franceâ'Tistlie unnatural league of a por
tion of our citizens with the oppressors of
their country.

SATURDAY EVENING, April 28-
Copy of a letter from Major Cunjlant Free
man, to the Secretary of >lVar, dated New-
Orleans, 6>h April, 1798-
Sir, s
After I had closed my letter to you,
which I had continued from the second to
the fifth instant, I received one from capt.
Guion, of which I enclose you a copy,
and an ex trad-os a 1 tter from Mr. Daniel
Clarke, to his nephew.
Lad evenihg arrived here a boat the
Illinois. I have teveived the following in
formation from a Mr. Kenner, who came
passenger. That he separated from the-de*
tachment under the command of Major
Kersey, on Sunday the firft instant, at one
I o'clock, P. M. he supposes between five
and fijt leagues above the Walnut Hills ;
that as the Illinois boat had a fail, and the
wind was fair, they left Major Kersey, and
halted at the Walnut Hills early in the e
vening ; that the works had not been de
stroyed, but appeared to be in good order ;
that major Kersey mull have arrived at his
station .early on Monday morning. The
detachment Isft the Chickafaw Bluffs on the
19th of last ndonth, and had been detained
by contrary winds and bad weather. Mr.
Kenner observed that the Major's boats
' were old and that he was therefore obliged
ta proceed with the greatest caution.
The Spanish troops from Natchez had ar
rived at Baton Rouge. Mr. i Kenntr saw
I them there on till fourth inft.

I " Should this find you in Netf-Qrleao*,
it will be handed to you by a Mr. SieWirft
Wilkins from Kentucky, brother to our
Quarter Master General; he left the Chick
-1 al'aw Bluff on the 15th instant, where capt.
1 Peirce had been thirteen days, and
Major Kersey had not yet moved, and I
have reason to believe that he is not yet arri
ved at the Walnut Hills, which place was
evacuated on the night of the 23d âand
Friday next, the 30th, is the day fixed for
the fame operation to take place here."
ExtraÃ of a letter from Mr. Darnel Clarke,
of Clarkefville, to Daniel Clarke, Jun. of
New-Orleans, dated March 31, 1798.
" The American flag was hoisted at the
Fort of Natchez the 30th instant, and Mr.

Yesterday, the House of Representative
of the United States-palled the bill making
appropriations for she support of the milita
ry establishment fprtheyear 1798. They al
so went again into the confederation of the
bill for newly organizing, arming and dif
cip'ining the militia, of tke United States ;
I and. after some time spent the ein, the com
mittee rose, ""Snd being dil charged. from a"
further consideration of it, the bill was re
committed to a feleft commitiee.
A bill was received from the Senate for
authorizing the President to procure a num
ber of smalt vefTds to be equipped as gallies
or otherwise.
The house adjourned till Monday.

The report of the loss of a vefTel bound

THEATRE.
The following Toa&s were given in the In
terlude of General Wolfe, last evening,
written by Mr. Marshall for that oecafion.
May the Sword of Virtue, drawn in the
eaufe of Freedom, never be flieathed but in
Conquest !
May the bleffing3 of Liberty, secured to
us by the blood of our Forefathers, never
be forfeited by the degeneracy of the.ir
Sons.
The grateful Memory of those Heroes
who fought, bled and died for their Coun
try. âStandingand uncovered,with 3 cheers.
Although Bache called his myrmidons to
arms, and requested the republican party
(as he called it) to go to the Theatre in a
strong body for the purpose of exciting riot
and tumult, yet the Pattiotic Song
was received last evening with more etithufi
aftic applanfe than before. It was "again
encored and sung four times, and called for
much oftener. As the Theatre, more than
1 any other place, brings together people of
all forts aqd clafTes, the execration which
the French murder-shouts haveraceived there
and the unbounded and inceflant plaudits
that have for some time part been bestowed
on our own National Music ii'k happy evi
dence of the patriotic state 'of the pablic
mind.

It is really Angular if tbey have any influer.ee

that in New England (the great Eulwark
