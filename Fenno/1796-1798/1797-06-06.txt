A letter from the Attorney-General of Ireland,
to George Hardir.ge, Solicitor-General to the
Quctn.
Dublin, Jan. \fstb, 1797.
MY DEAR FHIEND,
Yaur letter, desiring the portraits of those
ytu call the great men of Ireland, was duly
attended to previous to the arrival of the
French fleet, on board which there are sup
posed to have been many experienced arri'ts,
who, without the aid of the sculptor, would
have taken off the headof any great man moil
expediiiouflyâhowever, as we were aware of
their [harp praftices, we had prepared some
capital performers, called yeomenâso 33 to
have insured the engraving of their whole
army in cafe of landing. It is to he lament
ed that not a tingle head wasflruck off- âpar-
ticuiarly as the JirJl imprefftons would have
been ineflimable. It would require a matter's
hand to give an adequatepidureof Ireland on
the late memorable occalion. The fubjeft
is wortbyof themoft lively colours ; and I trull
that Irish colours will never fly. We are all
anxious for the Bridport squadron.
Yonr's truly.
Exlra3 of a letter from Gibbon to Lord Shef
field, p. 605, dated 1 Ith September, 'B3.
" The other day the French ambassador
mentioned that the eenprefs of Ruflia (a pre
ciousâ) had potiponed to ratify the principles
of the armed neutrality by a definitive treaty,
but that the French, obliging creatures ! had
declared that they would neither propose nor
accept an article so d'fagreeable to England?'
Gibben was fecvetary of embassy at Paris.
The above anecdote is a curious faft, and
proves what dupes the Americans would have
been to have gone to war with England, at
the French faSion have long wished, merely
ti compel England to ratify the principles of
the armed neutrality, to pleaft the French.

AUTHENTIC ai'D INTERESTING.
Extra?, of a letter fro<h HullanJ, February
33. 1797.
General Pinckney and hi* family have ar
rived hereâon the other hand, Mr. Monroe
Ins arrived ia Paris, upon his return from his
tour through this couutry. What was the
cause of Mr. Pinckney's being ordered lo
leave fiance is vet u .known. But the con
dust of the French gownunent and iis de
pendents, at the fame time towards Mr. Mon
roe, and bil conduft towards them, give fe
tinus iweafinefs. The views and designs which
these circnmltances seem to indite, are of a
nature so important (o the conttitution, and
even union of our country, that I cannÂ«t but
feel anxinus to discover how far they really
extend ; aad cannot but observe, with con
cern, the apparent of an internal
American party wii'* the prefenr government
of France, to overthrow that of the United
States.
You will doubtlef*, before this reaches you,
be informed of official communications made
to the American miniller, from this govern
ment, in the course of the lad Autumn,
wherein they formally, without disguise or
hesitation, call upon '.he United States, to
viola.e their tieaty with Great-Britain, go to
war with her, and make a common cause with
the French and Batavian republics. Such,
probably is (till the intention of the French
Direftory. But, as at present they totally
despair of affefting their purpose by negoci
ating with our executive government, they
will probably turn all their efforts towards
the House of Reprtfeniatives. The aft of
June 5, 1794, againlt which Adet complains
so indecently, expires with the present fcf
fion of Congress. This is the law of which
Fauchet, in his difpatcb, No. 3, fays, that
Randolph told him, " a bill fiad palled the
House 0/ Representatives, which wounded
liberty." An ind'.fputable proof of it is, the
next cUufeof the dispatch, which represent*
Randolph as adding, (< They have at least
taken away the article, which prevents the
sale of the French prizes in our pons."â
Fauchet, in his plartering certificate, pre
tends, that this passage of his No. 3, refers
to a conversation which he had with Ran
dolph, in Apiil 1794, anrl that it related to
the political diviftans in different parts of the
United States, and a bill which gave the
executive powers, that might be abused and
wound liberty. The impudence with which
this flory is told, when the clasfe about tak
ing away the article relative to the sale of
piizes comes so immediately after, in the
dispatch, is not one of the lead curious par
ticularsin the ftrangepublication of Randolph,
rhi clause about the sale of prizes was (truck
out on the 2d of June, 1794, and Fauchet
certifies that the conversation was the April
before. In faft, from the internal evidence
of Fauchet's dispatch, compared with Adet's
la!l note, it is clearly the 7th feftion of the
aft of June j, 1794, which was so extreme
ly obnoxious to Mr. Randolph, and at the
fame titre is so to the French government.
Under these circumltances, the attempt to
pafj an imposition upon the putlic as to the
objeft of the conversation, is itfelf defcrving
of attention Why was there any desire of
disguise in this particular ? Why but be
cause Mr. Randolph's conference"! with Mr.
Fauchet, uponfubjefts to which the fame7th
fed ion naturally leads the contemplation,
were such as it was judged unfit to disclose.
This 7th feftion i* indeed an important thing,
and I am not a little curious to fee how it
will be treated in the House of Representa
tives when the law is to be continued ; that
is, in the courft of the present session.
What expedition or enterprise there may
be views of carrying on irom the territories
of the United States against the dominions
of another Tovereign, I am not qualified to
fay. France is at this time not only at peace,
but in close aliiaace with Spain. But Beithsr
peace nor alliance are complete or efTeftual
guards against projefts of invafiou or revolu
tion. There is uo doubt but that the Preach,
in their negociation for peace with Spaia, en
deavored long to obtain a ceflion of -Louisiana,
and have since the peace been equally folicit
ou* to receive it in exchange for the part of
St. Domingo, which was ceded to them.â
You will observe both in one of the Paiis pa
per* whic!i I have lately sent, and in the Ley.
den Gazette, an article of news, publifhcd at
Paris, as coming from Madrid, that an in
evitable revolution is upon the point of taking
place in Mexico ; and that the people there
will soon (hake off the yoke of Spain. The
pretence that this dilpofitio\i is fomented by
the English may be true or falfe, the material
objeft of observation is the paragraph itfelf,
and the quarter from whence it comes. You
best will know, whether 1 am merely fanciful
in combining it with Genet's arrival at Ohar
lefton, and his intended expedition at that
period; together with the various other symp
toms that have appeared down to a certain
lettei to colonel Thomas Fulham,* a North
Carolinian, which I find in the American
newspapers of the lafl summer, and to the
return of the fame colonel Fulham to Frarfce,
immediately after the ratification of the trea
ty with Great-Britain. The part of the
President's address to the people, applying
particularly to the inhabitant* of our western
Hates and territory, indicates the evidence of
a plan advanced to a configurable maturity.
An obfeure outline of a vait plan, calculated
exsftly for the French-meridian, suitable at
once to their ambition and thtir jealoufv, dif
eovcrs itfelf in these various incidents. If
th-'f plan really exilts in the extent, which
may be rationally fufpefted, the 7th feÂ£iion
df the aft of June 5, 1794, is a very import
ant obstacle to.vjew* for conducing expedi
tions against the territories of a foreign pow.
er, with which we are.at peace.
But however, that may be, it is certain
there iÂ» another plan, with the success of
which the other part of this feftion is total
ly incompatible ; and that is, the plan for
suspending totally the commerce between the
United' State* and Great-Britain. This de
sign, which ever since the middle of lafl sum
mer,. there has been fttong and increafmg
reason for fufpeQiug, is now in a manner
â¢ The writer miOshej theaameâit is Fulton.
opinly . notwSiHflauding all il>e am
bigtitjr wf.ich perv. â¢ <Â» all thjji official pa
[f-13 on the fut-jeft, and which indicates no
thing more than the view of retreating from
the system, in cafe they (hould finjl it im
praflicable, with a prctof.ce that they never
adopted it. .
To carry it into eff.-dt, they have two dif
ferent ratxlfl of proceeding : the one, bv
producing a war bet wee.i us and Great Bri
tain; the other by making a fort of war up
on in themselves, and forcib'y intercepting
all our navigation to and from Briiifli ports ;
at lead as far they can. But this yt!â¢
fedtion is an impediment equally to both thfcii
proeeffee. It prevents them from carrying
on a privateering trade hy mcar.3 of our own
citizens, whicli would be aliogether incon
filtem with neutrality ; and which, if not
fuppijeflcd, would at once harrafs the com
merce and pro'.tike a Date of hoUilltiea : and
at the fame time, it takei fronrthem the
means of intercepting forcibly the naviga
tion to and from Britilh ports, by dcpiivi.iÂ£
them of the means of keeping a line of ptiva
teets along the whole extent of our own
coad, which (hould be ready to meet every
vefi'el which they (hould choose to (lop, up
on iis entering into or nTuLng from the seve
ral ports. To them this i* an essential ob
ject ; for our navigation with British ports
could not be forcibly interrupted, to a very
material degree, but by arreting the vessels
at the moment of departure or of arrival
This they cannot do in the European seas,
Lccaufe the British naval Superiority keeps
them generally clear, and a privateer or fri
gate seldom has a chance of picking up mere
than a (ingle vessel or two, before it is itfelf
taken. Neither can they do it upon the
American coad, while they are prevented
fiom fitting out their privateers in our own
ports, and while our citizens find their pro
perty protected by the juiildiftion of our own
tribunals. The consequences, therefore, of
an unrenewed expiration of this law, are, in
every point of view, so momentous, that 1
co. fider it as one of the principal purpofe3 for
which they are now undertaking to negoci
arc with the Houfeof Representatives againlt
the Executive of the United States.
At prefertt 1 am told here, that it is not
dofired that we (hould go to war with Eng
land ; that it would not even be for the fil
tered of France that we (hould. [ have con
versed, repeatedly, with the petfons upon
whom the principal executive funftions for
foreign affairs reft, and have urged so them
the obvious and inevitable conlequences to
this conntry, of a war between the United
States arid either France or Great-Britain.
Some of them, I have reason to believe, are
alarmed. The merchants, the renters, have
already perceived the eifefts of the mere p/of
peÂ£t, which is threatened ; and I know that
they are alarmed. The disposition therefore
here is right. I am even told that the French
Direftory wiil not pursue their fyllem to an
absolute rupture, and a hint has been given
me, that Adet's powers will be renewed to
difcufa the differences which have arisen, or
rather that the suspension of his funÂ£tions wiil
be removed. But all this may be intended
merely as a cloak to conceal (f-'figns of bof
tility, and prevent a state of preparation to
quarrel against them.
The measure of ordering Mr. Pinckney a
way, is so violent in its nature, that it is abso
lutely necessary to consider the Dire<story as de
termined upon proceeding to every extremity
forthe purpose of carrying their point 3 in A
merica. As it is unquedionable, "that the ruin
of our .commerce and a war with Britain are
invplved in these points, I cannot fuppoie that
the government of the United States will sub
mit ; and I mud therefore recur to an idea
which I have heretofore fuggeftet!âthat is, the
importance of a cool, moderate and candid
datcment to the world of the real situation of
our differences with France. The notes of A
det, and mod efpecialiy the speech of Barras to
Mr. Monroe, when he delivered his letters of
recal, flart pretenlions of superiority on the part
of France, and of dependence on that of the
United States, which mud be refitted and refu
ted. Inltead of which, it is painful to fay it,
Mr. Moproe himfelf in his speech gives them
countenance and encouragement, by talking of
generous afiiftarice, which never was given, and
which their own official documents have long
since disproved.
The papers publilhed by the British govern
ment concerning the negociation of Lord
Malmelbury, ferv* in a great measure to (hew
the immediate system of France The d Ablu
tion of the German Empire'is avowed as one of
the objeils. This plan which was checked by
the disasters of their armies on the Rhine, the
lalf autumn, appears by the capture of Mantua,
to be refuraed witn new vigor. Italy feeras to
be secured to them beyond the reach of acci
dent; the fate of the neutral dates in that quar
ter, is asmiferatle as that of those which are
parties in the war. Florence, Venice,and Ge
noa, by turns ate required to supply money and
provisions, no less than if they were in a date of
complete hodility; and no fort
orfubmiffion can remove thedanger that is con
tinually threatened, of revolutionizing the go
vernments, and turning them into new, one
and indivisible republics, allied and tributary
to France.
A very largÂ« detachment from the Austrian
army on the Rhine has marched into Italy, as
likewise have conficterable parts of the French
armies j another ltruggle U to take place in that
quarter which in all probability will terminate
hke the former. The Austrian forces like those
of all the allied powers thro'this war, are ap
parently a formidable body ; but a body rotten
at the heart. Treachery pervades all their
camps, or a languid indifference palsies every
exertion. Yet it does not appear probable that
the Emperor will yet make peace; because up
on every success the French troops obtain, their
government swells its political system and by
the time when.Audria will be ready to facri
fice the Netherlands, he will be required tu
consent also to the efiablilhment o[ a republic
formed upon his Italian dominions.
The troops which had been embarked for the
expeditioh against Ireland, are coming to join
the armies upon the Rhine, where it is now
fiid the French are to taki again their offenfive
poiition. I hear no more at preftnt of the in
tention to fefid them again to sea. The Direc
tory some days ago rtqueded the Legifiative As
sembly to place tliiriv three millions cf livres at
thedi r pofal of the minider of marine, I fee
they did allow him only twelve millions and an
half; a sum large enough, to squander or throw
away, but not competent'fur much else.
My letters from France intimate great ex

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
THURSDAY, MAY 24. _
Gall atin'r Speech coyTiNum)
But a question has been: indtreftly made
by gentlemen, whether it is proper to offer
to place France on the fame footing wit,h
other nations j this question had indeed been
already so well answered, that there was lit
tle left forhiti) to add ; and it might-be re-,
solved into the queftien, what is the l i of
nations ? Because if there is a precise law
of nations, that belongs to all, and must be
mutual ; this has been difcufled in the rfie
rits of the armed neutrality, which whether
it contained truly or not the fixed law of
nations was accepted as that permanent law
by America in the midst of her Revolution,
when it was above all other seasons the least
her interell so to recognize it, and which,
if there was a doubt, (he would have b.en
juftified in aÂ£ting upon to her own salvation
and benefit ; in like manner the Trapty of
1778 was concluded ; but the gentleman
from S. Carolina (W. Smith) had infilled
and the Secretary of State in his letter to
Mr. Pinckney had endeavoured to argue,â
that it was not meant to b; permanent; â
their arguments had been already so point
edly refuted by a gentleman from N. York
(Mr. Livingfton) that he had to add only
one conclusive faft ; the gentleman had as
serted that the armed neutrality had ceased
to operate upon the termination of the war;
now if it (hould be found that one power
had entered into that coalition and recogni
zed the principles thereof as a permanent
law, the gentleman's conclusions fell at once
to the ground ; the gentleman had argued
that the convention of armed neutrality was
not to be permanent, and the Secretary of
State had supported or rather broached the
fame opinionâwhat does that document it
felf declareâ" These stipulations (hall be
further considered as permanent, and (hall de*
cide in all matters of commerce and naviga
tion ; and in (hort, in every cafe where the
rights of neutral nations are to be deter
mined"âTo this article he would only add
this plain faft, which he fonnd recorded in
the history of the armed heutrality, which
had been quoted by gentlemen, that in the
year after the conclusion of the war, Portu
| gal. had formally acceded to that conven
' tion ; its provisions concern (hipping, and
jwe fee a maritime power acceding to it in
j the tranquil moments of peace, and 'agree
; ing to it as the permanent law of nations ;
and it is upon our accefiion to the principle
while we were ourselves at war, and when its
acceptance was in opposition to our interest
but conformable to our love of justice, and
upon our subsequent recognition of it as
well in the cafe of our Treaty with France
a3 with others, that we are now bound to
put France upon an equal footing with those
to whom we have since relinquiihed the
principle. He did not know any treaties of
other nations in which the fame principle
had not been recognized, unless it was in an
iiiftance mentioned of Rufiia having com
bined with England to do it away for the
temporary end of starving France into a sur
renderâor as was the fafhionable exprefiion,
of blotting her out of she map of Europe ;
Denmark and Sweden indeed had in some
measure given way to the nectffuv of the
times by declaring that they would abide
by none but generally received laws, arid io
this they no doubt adted with a prudence
that could not be blamed ; and it was right
under a preflure as urgent that the United
States had pursued a corresponding conduit;
and if right in these powers it could not be
laid to be wrong only in the cafe of France,
who being willing to maintain it, cannot
find the other powers ready or able to ren
der the support mutual and general; but it
had been said that America was not bound
by her Treaty with France, not to make
this relinqui(hment to Britain ; as a foreign
nation unquestionably (he had a right to
treat as (he pleased, and no other nation had
a right-to interfere in the afts of her sove
reignty ; but was it right to acknowledge it
in opposition to the law of nations, and to
grant it without an equivalent from the on
ly nation that had before denied that law ;
it (hould have been the fine qua non in our
ncgociation with Britain, not of war, but a
sim qua non of negociation ; it would have
been our interest & our duty not to abandon
the principle, even tho' our strength did not
allow us to support the execution, and we
(hould havÂ£ 4cft past depredations to have
been amicably compensated, but asserted
ftrefiuoully bur fectirity for the future : âthis
is a real effeftiial, and not such a fiftitious
security as we have now obtained ; the misÂ»
cbiefs of an abandonment of the principle,
is to us of immense magnitude. - â¢
On the contraband article, the gentleman
from S. Carolina had found Vattcl, who was
every thing in all Other cases, completely
void of authority, although Great Britain (
agrees with Vattel ; but how is France to
be contemned for her maintenance of the
doÂ£tnne against Britain ; the only way to
obviate the difficulty is by placing her on
the fame footing as France In this refpeA,
and specially stipulating that the principle
is not abandoned, but' granted for a period
co-ex iftcnt to each of the powers ; this will
be a leflcr evil, but there is little to be deri
ved from either party, and when two pow
ers are at war, when we are not able to en
ter into e.itenfive hostility, we had better
incur a disadvantage where theie is no dis
honour, than infill upon objects of subordi
nate value, which may be in more auspicious
times retrieved.
It had been kid 1 , we should not ojtr
1 France an ultimatum ; he had not heard one
reitfon to shew the bad consequences of such
a step ; he was for giving an ultimatum,
and for this very phi a reason, because every
thing that could be known on this fubjedt
by either party was already perfectly under
stood, but more particularly because Mr.
Piacknev informs us, the people of France
entertain an opinion that we are divided ;
which though true in some cases, would put
us on ftich ground a3 to shew thlt on the
true national points we Were united to a
man. Those wlw eppofe it on the ground
of conceflion, would do well firit to shew
that what we -ougjit and are certainly wil
ling to allow, can.be.so confidcred.
If this amendment should be rejettÂ»d, cr
â¢at least tire spirit of itAould not be adopted,
can it be expend thnt'gentlemen who for
merly opposed and disapproved of the mea
sures of adminiftratian, will f&crifice their

which has been raised with the obvious in

ther he meant to repair all the fortifications,
which had heretofore been contemplated.â
Perhaps some might be necessary, but he
thought, considering the present state of our
finances, fsw of them ought to be attended
to. Much of the money already expended
on this fubjett had been thrown away. He
particularly mentioned New-York.
Mr. W. Smitjl thought the gentleman
hanbeenlong enougha member of thathoufe
to know, that when they were about to fet
tle the principle of a thing, that it was not
usual to go into details. If the rcfoluticn
was agreed to, a committee would be ap
pointed, who would report such fortificati
ons as it appeared to them necrfiary to be
attended to, with an estimate of the expenee,
upon which the house would determine ;
or a sum of money might be voted, and
leave it to the President to employ it as ap
peared to him beftbut this was not the
question, but merely whether a farther sum
of money should be voted fÂ» this objett.
Mr. T hatcher thought they were not
ripe for .this Cabjeci, as they did not know
what was the state of the different fortificati
ons. He thought as there were a number
of propofitiots, in some degree con netted,
tjbat it was ilefirable" that they should be
printed > Ijejhg-efore moved that the com
mittee might rife to give time for this to be
Mh GfLEs wiflied the gentldnan would
reverfe'his projbfitions, and let the one' for
.railing money ceWs'e firft. He did not kn6w
whether thfiy were prepared to meet this
expenee. He "did pet mean to oppefe th;
prefcnt motion r he supposed it wo aid pass.
But he thought they were aboit to be too
precipitate* in their measures. At a time
when all Europe seemed to be tired of the
war, and about to make peace, we feeued
to be disposed to rush into it. He id r.ot
believe thatniuch good would be done by
this system. cf fortification. He did not
think the United States were more secure
now, than before they had a fmgle work of
the kind. We have, said he an extenlive sea
coast, and it was not to be expetted that an
eneniy would chufe to come to precisely the
place where a fortification stands. It was
his opinion that the interests of the country
would be fiirved, by letting thi3 matter lie
ov;r till th? next feflion.Ms-. Williams obfcrvcd-th.s.r the ferie
of the committee would be firft taken upon
the propriety of into the measure ; if
there was a majority in favor of it (and he
could not doubt it) the matter would be re
ferred to a felrÂ£k commit tee, who would make
their report upon it.
Mr. Â«*>._ Smith was in favour of going in
to this
in Enrope, he thought it probable we might
be Artrwn into it.
Mr. Sv/an v/jck should not be opposed to
the pref.nt motion, because he agreed with
the gentleman from Maryland, that whilst
the war continued in Europe there was a
a probability of this country being drawn in
to the vortex. But he there was
some \Vaight also in the obfervatjon of the
gentleman from Virginia, with refpeft to
the wayaand means ; because if, after they
should agree to carry into effect certain mea
ftires, they should disagree about the means
their time would-have been spent to no pur
pose. â¢
Tha question was put and earned, there
being 62 votes in favour of it.
Mr. W. Smith moved the second Re
fohition.
Mr. Nicholas wished to know whether
the provision already made for completing the
three frigates was not fufficient ?
Mr. \V. Smith said he had no informa
tion on the fubjeft ; he had inserted the
word + nrrb!(ting as well a3 manning, left there
fhou!d"be ahy deficieecy.
Mr. Otis was not prepared, in so rapid
a way, to press resolutions of this import
ance, without having them printed, or time
to deliberate upon them. If he voted for
these resolutions, he should consider himfelf
as pledged to carry them into effect. He
therefore, hoped the committee would rife.
Mr. Macon was opposed to this resoluti
on. He did not believe that seamen could
Y>e got to man the vessels, as nearly four
times the price was paid for seamen's wages
that was paid when the lawforbuilding these
Vessels passed.
Mr. Rutledge was in favor of the com
-1 Vttee's rising.
Mr. Nicholas had no objection to the
committee's rising, if gentlemen wished it ;
iffo, he hoped the resolution agreed to would
be reported. He wished the principle of
the different resolutions, however, to be
fettled in a committee of the whole.
Mr. Craik, Mr. Claiborn, Mr. Var-
HVM, and Mr. Coit were in favor of the
committee's rising.
Mr. Swan wick thought it would be belt
that a committee should be appointed to re
port on the business.
Mt. S. Smith saw no reason for the
<ommittee's riling, because if gentlemen
were not prepared to vote upon this resolu
tion, they might go on to others. Tho'
Jie should vote in favour of this propofition<
he should not hold himfelf bound to vote ul
timately for the bill, if he disliked it.
The motion for the committee to rife was
withdrawn, and afterwards renewed by Mr,
M'Dowell, who also withdrew it, on a
suggestion from Mr. Livingston that the
resolution would be less objectionable to run,
" that a committee be appointed to enquire
into the propriety of &c. and when the com
mittee had the business referred to them,
they could possess themselves of all the ne
eeflary fafts, and report them to the house.
Mr. Gallatin said, if the queflioa wis to
determine the principle of manning the frigates,
the resolution ltiÂ»d right as it was ; but if it
were not intended, by adopting this resolution,
to commit any man, bat only to fay, tli.it they
would take the business into conficieration, and
if found urefill and neceflary, and funds were
attainable, rhey wwuld carry it into effect, then
the amendment of the ge-stleman from Wew-
Virk (Mr. Livingfton) would be proper. As
tothe committee's rising, hec ould fee no ground
for it, as these propositions were not new they
had had them before jhem for three weeks in
tbHpsrcb of the I'refident j of coorfe, so far
Xs related to the frigates, gentlemen mull have
formed an opinion, yet lie agreed that it was
desirable t& fee finite documents on the fubjefl,
before a decided affirmative or negative was
gifrfn'. lie Was therefore in favour of ihe A
raendment for a committee to be appointed.
He wifhtd all those fubjeÂ£ts which were of a
t'oubt'i;! nature be thus determined. On
the other haflrr r e upon which members
were ready to 1 at 6nce, either by an ac
ceptance or rejeC..uii, might- be vcted upon in
the form in which they were introduced.
Mr. Pamcik. read the motion which was en
tered into lift year, and thought it would be a
good model for the present.
Mr. W. Smith was of a different opinion:
he thought the committee should firii decide
the ahftrait principle. lie thought it would be
wrong to refer to a felcdl committed a business
in which every member was so intimately inter
red, and he doubted not gentlemen were rea
dy to decide upon this abftraft question. With
regard lo espcnfe, he was of/opinian, that if
thofituation of the country required it, that,
should be no obje<ft, If gent lemen though: dif
ferent y, they would of course negative thepro
poCtion. Any information on the fubjefl,
could be got before the business was finifhed.
He thought they fhoyjd firft fay what were itie
necefTary objects of expense, and then provide
the money, which might be done by borrowing
or by taxes. If thert was a necessity for the
rxprnfe, there was no doubt the money would
bo raised. If gentlemen were not prepaied to
difrufs the fubjeet, he had rio objeilion to the
fcmm'ttee.'s Tifing, and, in the Honfe, the
Secretary 15 War, ntight be called upon for in
lofmati<ui.
Mr. N ichouas thought the question was I
not fairly preftnted. It was whether they
fhouid man the frigates. But when rhey were
called upon to determine this ; they ihould
know w hen. they would be ready to receive the
men. The probability was, that the frigates
wouUi i.pt.l>4 ready to receive the irum before
the next fcfiion of Congress.
Mr. Dayton (thefpeaker) was in favour of
the original proposition. He wifhfrd to provide
fcr tnannmg all the frigates which could begot
r<*ady before the next lefiion'of Congref*. He
1 itYed if they adopted this plan, unneeeflary
Oelay woujd he prevented*
Mr. PAKKkR was ready to vote for the pro
portion of the gentleman from S. Carolina. He
helieyed the frigite in Philadelphia, might be
equipped, ripped and manned in three months."
Tbc only reason why he var>ed hiÂ«mot'>n was
that he might include the nrxt propofiticn ;
but bel>efieved it w*uM be be tu* so** them to
Ifcand separate, as be? Â»?e he votft for t.'ie acMi

<Trefs ; that at Baltimore would be in readiness

â Smith said, the f. igite at
Balttfltore, would be iawnchcal the 4th of
Tuiy, and the equipments were in greater for
wardaefs than those for the frigate aÂ£ Philadel
phia.
Mr. Baldwin was agaaift referring this
propefition to a ieiefi com.nittee. It would be
defirahle, in.leed, to know what the coit of
{leing the business would be, but every one knew
how little to be rehed upon were estimates of
this kind. He was ready to vote for manning
of the frigates ; indeed, there wis ho question
upon which he was so ready to fay apt, as upon
this.
The question was about to be put on Mr.
Livingftoni motion, when
Mr. Varnum said he thought the wording
of the resolution improper, as the word corn
pleating would clafti with the a a of last session.
The question was put and negatived, 50 to 34.
Mr. Macon wished the frigates to bo completed,
but not manned, he therefore moved to flrike out the
words u and manning."
The question was put and negativedâthere being
only 24 vo.es in favor of it.
Mr. Giles moved to strike out the word 44 com
pletirJg; ' but, after some converfatron, the moiion
was withdrawn, and the original resolution was car
ried
Ihe third proportion next came under considera
tion.
Mr. Nicholas hoped the gentleman who introd'ic- *
cd this motion would tell them for what purpose
these additional vessels were wanted. He supposed
this resolution to be conne<sled with the next, and if
so, he thought they should be considered together.
he asked. were to be the i u6lions given to
the commanders of these veflels ? He thought it a
very embarrafling bufinefs,*ahd one that would cer
tainly lead to war; hay, indeed, the thing seemed to
be a war operation in itfelf.
Mr. W. imith wished the geirtleinan had made his
enquiries before.. 1 hey would have come morepre
perly when the frigates were under confidei ation, as
ihe fameobjeÂ£tion would lie against both; as the next
refoNitiori had no more connexion with this than
\*ith that already agreed to The gent leman felmed
to have let go the opportunity of calling upon him ;
as, however, he did not wifti toevade (tho'
he was not willing to fay he would hiinfelf vote <or
the measure) he would .fay, that it appeared to him,
from the present Hate of the commerce < t this coun
try, to bi necefTary to provide convoys for our veflels
These veflels might not, indeed, be employed as a ie
gular convoy, but partly confined to ihe coasts sfnH
harbours. This was a separate question ; or it mighr
be left to the executive to employ them as he
fee proper. He was nor, however, ready to
opinion on the fubjeft. He rose principally to re
mark upon what had fallen from the gentleman last
up, as to employing a convoy being an aft of war
He owned he had not lookrd deeply into the fubjett
at present, but he recolletted in our treaty with Sue-,
den, there was a stipulation, that when both powers
were neutral, they should protett each Other's com
merce.
Mr. Giles thought this a very extraordinary mea
sure. He called the attention of the committee to
the critical fuuation of Europe, and thought, before
they went into any expensive operations, they should
wait the iflue of the negociation, cfpecially as he
supposed it was probable a full feflion might be ne
ceflary. It had been said several of the ports in the
Weft Indies were in a blockaded and rebellious flare.
He did not suppose it was the intention of the com
mittee, by means of a convoy, to p <f& a trade to
those ports; this would be a certaiu means of pro
voking war. He thought they ought to make a paufc
âas it was probable tkat in less than four months
from this time they might again be in feflion, and, in
the mean while, the affairs of Europe might have
taken such a turn as to do away the ne'.eflhy of go
ing into hostile measures.
Mr. Nicholas expe&ed the gentleman'from
South Carolina would have acknowledged that the
two resolutions were connected. Indeed he must
have intended these veflels to be employed in th : s
way, or such a resolution would not have been in
troduced With refpe& to Sweden's treaty for a
reciprocal convoy, there was some ground for it,
a* there was a difference betwixt the northern pow
ers of Europe as to the principle of free ships mak
ing free goodsâbut where tm-re was no difference
as to principle, no fu h thing could take place.
Mr. Gallatin said the prefect resolution was
certainly i" some degree connected with the n xt.
It was understood that the purchasing of frigates ;
and fioops of war w-s for the purpose of convoy
ing our. trade. Under the prefstnc clrcumftances j
of this cowntry he should be oppt fed to this pro
portion ; not that he denied the right of neutral
powers to afford convoys vo their merchants' ves
sels ; but because under present circumflances it
was impolitic to adopt th<* measure, not only for
the reasons urged by the gentleman from Virginia, :
but on account of our Ctuation with refpedl to 1
Franoe at the present moment. By our treary with ;
France enemy property was to be refpedetf cn board
American vessels, and certain articles used in the !
building of (hips were exempted from the lift of j
contraband the l'refident would of course be o- !
bliged to give orders to have our vessels prote&ed
in this lituation, and who eould not fee that this
would be the source of war ? And if the convoy
were not to be employed to enforce these two pri
vileges, he did not fee what use it could be of. * He
knew that depredations without number had been
committed in the Weft-Indies; but he was led to
believe they werÂ« done by pirates rather than by
any other vessels. But suppose it were pra&icable
to drrtinguifh betwixt piratical and regular captures,
yet, he must confefs, he would not be for running
the risk of a rupture, by fending out aimed vessels
to contest the point, especially when we have rea
son to believe that these attacks are unauthorized
by the French Government
Mr. G. thought it would he necessary to extend
our na.vy in cafe of war only ; and were this un
happily to be our lituation, vessels might easily be
put-chafed without delay : hut whilst we were at
peace, Jie did not think the advantages which could
be derived from a convoy, would be a fufficient in
ducement to go intÂ«rthe measure. Bef:de3 he was
'induced by another motive to give this propofltion
his negative. He knew the depredations on our
commerce had been great; but he did nWlook up
oh this-lofs as fallen only upon merchants. There
was not an individual who did not bear a part of it.
For inftancc, if a merchant paid 10or 15 percent,
additional upon his cargo, he will put a proportion
ably high price upon his commodities, which mult
eventually be paid by the consumer. Therefore,
fo'far as an argument might be drawn from this
circumstance, it became a question of expediency,
and ha thought it would be granted that the ioi's ta
individuals would be lefi iu this way than if they
had tofupport a navy to protect our trade.
Mr. W.Smith acknowledged there was consi
derable weight in the arguments of the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, though he did not find fuflici'
ent to induce him to change his opinion. The
gentleman from Virginia had endeavoured to (hew
that a? there was no difference oi opinion as to prin*
ciple betwixt Trance and this country, the regula
tions entered into with Sweden did not apply ;
whiift the gentleman from Penrfjrlvania had pro
duced afgumenrs to fcew that we were in that fi
tua'ion. With rcfpe& to the treaty articles in dif
pute, it would be an easy matter, Mr. S. said, for
the PrefiJent to give the commanders of our veflels
proper inftru&ions on that head. And would any
gentleman fay it was not right to defend our vessels
agai 11ft pirate* t Would not the French fay, if they
were applied to for rodrefs, Â«' You knew these w. re
piratev why did ypu oot defend youj-felves against
them r The which seems fÂ» much to
a'.arcrgentlemen, fhfculd be put out of the ques
tion , said he : if your property is unjustly att-ck
cd, will you defend it ? â¢
But it was said thj loss did not fall ucna the
1 merchant, Jjwt upifn t'ie eonfunier. Mr 5 aTert
i en its'.'l i:;ibn tile cÂ»antrv ; and so far fr.im the
' of the J 1 .
J the left sustained by captures, it wonld not, in his
opinion, be atmthpart of the'amonnt; forwhat-
I ever the p'.undecers got, tt, -, mi ry loft- Mr. S.
said h- had niadi? a rouÂ»h Calculation of v/hat woald
be the eipenfe of thtee frigates of 16 guns, aiiu 6
sloops of war of 16 ?uns, anJjfmnd it to '.e 916,
00c dollar., including thoequipment and mai.nii g
far or.e year'
Rut, fii! Mr. P. doeÂ« not the farmer
by these fioliations ? Hecrrtsinly does ; for, if
the merchant was obliged to pay an extriva
pinr hifiiranee, he would pive the tefs for the
farmer's produce; bjt, he, the expense
of the frigates, 'will be no loss |oth? country,
53, it they eoft a million of dollars, the jvh.de
| u ill be paid to our arn citizens, every article
â  used in tie building of these veflels being the
â  produce of the United States.
j But gentlemen complain of our impa
-1 tience in the business ; he thought the
! wrongs we had fuffered fufficicnt to rouse our
I refentmetit. It was also said, that theise was
: a probability of peace, and why go on with
: this Sxpence ? But he might as well fay,
I there was no probability of peace. One
supposition would Hand againll the other.
; Indeed, who knew that the Czar of Russia
would not join the coalition againll France.
| A hope of peace, therefore, was not a fuffi
ciently liable ground upon which to calcu
late. We mull, said he, either interdict all
trade, fufifer merchants vefTels to arm, or go
into the measure proposed.
Bu it was said that France had declared
certain Britilh ports in the Weft Indies
blockaded and ;n a state of rebellion, and
therefore, we mull not trade with them, but
he did not know why our vefTels Ihould be
subject t i be taken, and our seamen to be
hung, because they chose to make these de
clarations. Declarations, which he trusted
this country would never acknowledge.
What, said Mr. S. will be the conse
quence of jiegociating without taking any
measure of defence ? It will put it in the
power of France to make requisitions on us
to any amount she she may spin out
the negociation, by throwing difficulties in
the way of it; (lie may take all our vefTels ;
"Jlnd, when (he has drained us of all our
wealth, it wjll be said, we mujl fulmit. â
\Vhere will then be your privateers ? Your
vefTels are taken, and your seamen gone !
The gentleman from Pennsylvania admit
ted the right of neutral powers to convoy
their vefTels : That gentleman put the mat
ter upon the expediency of the thing, which
was the true ground upon which he wished
to have it difcufied.
Mr. Giles said the gentleman from South
Carolina talked of defenfive measures, but
his plans were offenfive. That gentleman
had undertaken to doubt the right of France
to declare her ports, Rebel ports. Was
this defenfive ? Every nation had this right.
It was pot long since Great Britain exerci
sed it againll us. Yet, aided by a convoy,
he wished to push our trade to these ports.
This would not only be hazarding the peace
of the country, but taking the diredi road
to war.
Mr. Baldwin said, in all their determina
tions, with refpeÂ£t to a naval force, however
great' the emergency, it had always been de
termined to build, rather than to purchase
vefTels, and he saw no reason from departing
from this mode, in the present instance.
After some objections from Mr. W. Smith
to the building plan, which he said would
take three or four years to furnifn the prd
pofed vefTels, whereas merchants vefTels
might be immediately purchased, which
would answer the purpoTe of small frigates,
tbe Committee rose, reported the two rcfo
lutions, which the House took up and
agreed to, and Committees were appointed
to report upon tliem by bill or otherwise.
A message was received from the, Senate,
with two bills which had passed that HouTe,
viz. a bill for prohibiting for a limited time,
the exportation of arms and ammunition,
and encouraging the importation thereof;
and a bill to prevent citizens of the United
States from privateering against natipns in
amity with, or against citizens of the Uni
ted States. Both which were twice read,
and committed to Committees of the Whole
to-morrow. Adjourned.

" believe that the conduft of the govern,

foreign nations." In this Hate of thing 3,
the Executive is maligned by thetqpls of a
foreign faction, because men are appointed
on a million to France who are known to be
attached to the government and its admin
ifixation. MalignedâNay, charged with
the infamous deiign of involving the country
in war, while profeffing to he friends of
peace ! It is impossible that tils machina
tions of this faction fnould deceive the
people. Such detestable insinuations mull
be spurned with horror. We trull the
practice of nurturing an opposition to
our Government by appointing to office
secret or open enemies to the Constitu
tion, will never be adopted. At the prc
fent moment thi'3 is the game the faftion is
playingâTbe Government, equally with
the People, muftdefire peace ; it is not pos
sible always to command itâevery measure â 
will mod afiuredly be adopted that is con
fillent with the honor, rights, duties and in

vocal characters, or such as from their predi

" Whereas it is alledgcd by divers JLiritilh mer

44 debts to a con fid rable amount, which were bona

44 owing to them by Citizens or iahabitanta of the

44 only the full recovery of the said debts has been
delayed, but alfothe value and security tnereof
' have been in fevcral inl'tanccs impaired and ieff

" obtain and actually have and receive full and
44 adequate compensation for the loÂ£LÂ»and e'ama

of justice, the United States will make full and
