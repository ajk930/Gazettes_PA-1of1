Debate on a motion to re-Confjer the qnefl'tori far
-pofpolling the conjideration of 11 Bill fuppfe
tiientary to an Afl for preventing rertaifi
c rimes againjl the United Slatei, paJJ'ed 'June
i 1 â¢ 794' thefirft Monday in February.
( Concluded from yijlerdaf' s Gazette,)
TUESDAY, DECEMBER 26?
Mr.* Sewall was in favour of re-consider
ing flie queflion ; not that he wished the
business crowded upon the honfj ; he had
no objection to a fortnight, or longer, be
ing given. theij observations
on this fubjeit, had recurred to the proceed
ings of last Congress, which had notliing to
do wiilftheprefent question, and argued as
if t here urere a law forbidding merchants to
Krm their veflels ; whereas there was no
filch thing, because he never could confidpr
executive diredtions as law. ' It was true
tfie ptfefident of the United States had for
bidden the arming of veflels, except for the
P. a It-India and African trade ; but there
were no regulations to prevent impolitions
. in this refpedt, and nothing was more easy
than for vr.Tels to clear out for those places,
and to go to others, and if they did so, they
were fubjeii at present to no forfeiture. It
Was proper, therefore, that Congress should
come to some determination on the fubjeit,
and fay whether merchants had a right to
arm, or not, and under what reftri&ions ;
as, at pref?nt, the whole burthen was im
properly thrown npon the Prcfideht. Wbilft
t:ie bgfinefs remained upon its present foat
â¢'ng, circumstances might arise which would
be very unpltafant. For inflanee, if a mer
rhant were to sue a ccflledtor for carrying
into effect the orders "of the executive, it
Would be itapoflibltf" for arfy to found
a decision upon those orders. Nothing,
' Mr. S. said, could be gathered from the
proceedings of last Congress, as the present
bill wan intended merely to regulate a right
ivhich the merchants already pofleffed of
artning their vefitls, so as to prevent hostile
â¢aggreflions. There was nothing in this
n. eafu)-e, be said, which could give offence
to our mfifers, even if we were colonics of
Trance, of of Great-Britain. AH that was
intended was a defence against pirates,
whom no country would own ; for, if a
restitution was asked for, on account oflof
fes fnftaitjed by them, it would be said by
Trance or Great-Britain, " we know them
" not, you ougf t to defend yourfelvcs against
them." As to the obfervatiot) of the gen
tleman from Virginia, that our merchants
would continue to acquiesce in the present
state Of thing-, it might be so ; but he
thought they had* a just claim upon the
United States. He believed they were gen
erally unwilling to arm, except under the
- regulations of the United States ; but they
cught not to take advantage of this acqui
efccnce, and fay to them, without concern,
" you should go to sea and run your rifles as
usual," Under these disadvantages, he did
not think they should. As to our present
fituatifln with refpedt to France, he did not
think it ought to be alluded to, as the pro
. posed regulations,' as had before been ob
served, were not intended to operate against
thern, or any other nation, but against the
piracies committed by order of Vi&er
Hugues, or any other marauder, who may
set up his authority in that quarter of the
world. So desirous were the merchants of
having a defence against this description of
veflels, that since they could not carry out
real guns, they have lately resorted to the
carrying of wooden guns, that they might at
least have the appearance of defence upon
their veflels. lie thought to be obliged to
have recourse to this practice, was derogato
ry to the honour of the nation.
Mr. Dana said, it was not very liberal to
ascribe to the committee who reported this
bill, motives which they themselves did not
avow. If he did not mistake the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) he had said
that this bill was calculated to mislead the
paflions of our citizens, and prepare them
for war. The committee had not stated a- I
ny thing of this kind. Th<y had stated an
evil to exist, and proposed a remedy. The
depredations which had been committed up
on our commerce by pirates, unauthorized
by any government, were notorious; and
that we had a right to defend ourselves a
gainst them, was admitted on all hands ;
but there was a neceflity for the interfer
ence of Congress in the business, and, for
this purpose, the present bill was reported.
The measures proposed had been spoken of
as measures ofhoftility ; they were 110 fueh
thing ; he would not adopt any meafureo
now, that he would not adopt in a state of
profound peace, and the present bill was no
more than a part of our general system for
the regulation of the conduft of our mer
chants. Mr. D. alluded to the order which
had been iffhed by the late and present Pre
sident in relation to the fubjeft of arming,
and Slewed the neceflity there was for an in- j
tcrference of Congress. He did not think i
this question was decided the last fffllon. â j ,
But it was laid, that this fubjeft woujd in- â¢
terfere with the negociat ns now carrying
oil with the French republic. Thisrwas a
Jlrange argument indeed. What were the ! ,
principles laid down by France with refpeft ] (
to this country. They fay " they will res- j ,
pe6t treaties, when it is their interest to do â  ,
so." He, therefore, supposed it would be J J
as much for the interest of France to be at j
peace with us, if our veflels were ,armed, as j j
if they were not. Thci,e was another prin- j
ciple. They will " r<*fpedt our rights, when j
we know how to make them refpe&ed."â (
Could this regulation, therefore,weaken that ,
refpedt ? He thought not. To poll pone - .
j the e'lefti.jtlj from fueh a motive, wjjuld be
h.tim mating. It wanld be faying,' we dare
n;.t take any measures of defence against the
marauders on our coail, }<ft we fhoiild give
offence to a foreign power. He hoped they
should not be thus influenced.
â it r ' Thatcher said,. he did not rife to in
j voke th-genius of America, or any other
genius. He did not believe is any genii.
' He wished to attention of th;-noufe
â  to trie queilion, which he thought they had
1 forgotten.; for he belle vedy any one coming
into the fioufe, in the course of the debate,
might have guefled for forty years and not
1 found it out. The queftipn was, whether
' the former vote should be re-considered. It
â  was immaterial whether a paÂ£[ion for France
or any other itrong paSion, had overruled
reason and influenced the vote. It was fttf
ficient that .two or three persons had stated
, themselves as ni.(taken in their vote, to wish
j- -the queih'on to be r'e-confidered. If this
were the queflion, he did not fee what they
had to 80 with the war in Europe, or with
the' negociations carrying on Wtth France ;
but, as it had been the practice to abandon
the questiOn, and raise other fubjefts, he
( would take the liberty of following the ex
( ample which had been vfet, by remarking
â¢ upon what had been said. [The Speaker
j fignified to Mr. T. that, in doing so, he
> would be out of order, and having exprefT
-1 ed his intention, the deviation could not be
, admitted.] Mr. T. however, continued to
-make some observations on what had fallen
from the gentleman from N. Carolina (Mr.
M'Dowell) as to thepropofed mcafure hav
ing effeft upon the negotiation. This, he
shewed, to' be next to impolfible, as we were
J expefting to hear from our tlegociators ev
ery day, and they could not hear of the
| proceedings of congress on this ftibjedt for
two months to come. The question, said
be, 13 to arm against rovers and pirates, and
surely gentlemen would not fay that the
Terrible Republic were a set of rovers and
pirates ; but they must fay so, if they said
this bill was against them. He believed
frauce refpe'fted itfelf too much to fay this
bill was intended against her. The gentle
man frtjm VirginiaÂ»( Mr. Nicholas) had said
there was no change irt the fltuation of
things since last feflion ; but he believed
there was this change, as it refpe&ed com
merce ; we were now mere allured than e
vcr, that the chief of the depredations com
mitted upon our commerce were committed
by unauthorized marauders. M. T. con
cluded with reading an extrail from the
President's speech, as conveying his fanti
mcnts with r*fpecl to the difadjufted affairs
of Europe, the general want of morality,
and religion, and the conftquent uncertain
ty of permanent peace.
Mr. Baldwin said, if the original question
had now been whether the cofifiJeration of
this fubjeÂ£t should be postponed for three
or four weeks, he should have felt himfelf
indifferent as to the ifTue. But it was with
regret he saw the question brought back for
conGdcration. The gentleman last up had
spoken of three gentlemen having been mis
taken, and wishing to change their votes.
He heard but of one, as the gentleman who
seconded the motio'n, did it only that the
mover might have an .opportunity of voting
as he wished. He did not think, therefore,
that this was a fufficient ground for recon
sideration of the vote which had been tak
en. When the house voted upon a ques
tion, without argument, it must be fuppo
led they voted from conviction. A mo
tion for the reconsidering of a fubjcfl was
not a favorite motion ; since a repetition of
such iViotioos would make it next to impos
sible to proceed with the public bufiuefs.
The queflion of arming or not arming, he
said, would yet come before them in a va
riety of shapes, before the bill could be ma
tured, that there was no neceflity of arrest
ing it in its present stage. He himfelf ex
pected that when the firft Monday in Feb
ruary moved, some of the committee
who reported the bill, would have propo
sed a ihorter time ; but, when they did not
he supposed they thus argued, " We have
considered the fubjeft for four or fiveweeks;
we will give other gentlementhe fame time."
And he believed, if they so judged, it was
the lieft course which could-he taken ; for
the longer time there was "given frtr confid
ing and maturing the fubjedt, the greater
probability there would be of coming to a
speedy ani proper decifior..
Mr. J. Williams was in favour of re-con
fideringthe vote. The aÂ£t of 1794, he said
had been differently construed, and the soon
er congress determined the true eonftruftion
the better. To put off the fubjeÂ£t for five
weeks, would occasion considerable loss to
the merchants, as they did not know what
event's might arise. If the fubjedt was- not
adted upon till the firft Monday in February
it would be the firft of March before the aÂ£t
was pafied, and the firft of April before it
could be known at the extreme parts of the
union. He himfelf was undetermined whe
ther it was right to authorize merchants to
arm or not, but he did not wish the question
so long postponed, he wished to have it dif
euffed.
Mr. N. Smith said, as the reasons which
influenced his vote, had not been stated by
any other member, he would take the liber
ty of Hating them. He should vote against
the re-consideration, though he agreed with
gentlemen who were in favour of the bill.
He thought the ftieafure a perfectly neiftral
one, and such as no foreign nation had a
right to take Umbrage at ; but those gen
tlemen must agree with him, that it was
not likely the meaftire would be silently a
dopted, or without a lengthy 3nd full dis
cussion. It was idle to fay, that becaufc
the measure was only intended to operate a
gainst piiates, there was no occasion to in
troduce any Foreign nation into the difluf
fion. It was certain, that whenever the
fubjtÂ£t was difcufled, our situation with re
fpedt tb Foreign powers, wou'd certainly
form a part of the debate, and this it was he
dreaded. He believed it might do much
mifehief. - He, therefore, differed with those
gentlemen who wished Â»o get into the dif.
j cuilion, ami who did not frern to want an
immediate deeifion ; he firoeld have no ob
jection to the decision, but, he wished, for
I the present, to avoid th* discussion. Before
j ifhV Teffinrf flofed, he should think it ne'cef
l-fery to decide upon a meaftlre of this kind;
but he wiflied to fee further before the busi
ness was entered upon: he was, therefore,
against ie,confide ring queftion.
' Mr. Otis replied to foaie remarks which
had beep made upon what fell from Kirn,
and juftififd what lie had before said, and
the warmth which he felt on <he occaficn, as
natural. He concluded by observing, that
it was necessary to cheer th.Â£ spirits of the
â¢people by a measure of this kind ; to raise
the expectations of the merchants, and not
to drive" commerce, which came mourning
into that Honfe,' to defpa'ir; but if their
hands were to be tied, and 110 proteftion was
.to he given to trade,Â»the .-merchants fliould
he their determination as soon as
possible ; and told that> though they draw
frclm tb<m millions of dollars a year in sup
port of the revenue, yet they will not attend
to their grievances until within a few weeks
of the close of the session, when, perhaps,
fuGcient time will r.cty remain to carry any
meafuYe which may be proposed, into a
law.
Mr. Pinckney faiJ, as he was not a'mem
ber of the' House during the last session, he
hoped he ftiould be.excused in wiihing to
enter into an earlier difctiffion of this quefti
.on than other gentlemen seemed to wi(h.â
-Hit though he was not in the Houfc at
the last session, he had observed the proceed
ings of It; and though fomc of the motions
for arming were negatived, there were others
of a defenfive nature agreed to; such as the
holding in readiness Bo,oco militia, the ap
propriation for repairing the forts and har
bours, See. which were not thought at the
-time, to be at all offenfive to any Foreign
nation; and he was of opinion with those
gentlemen .who believed that a law authoriz
ing our merchant* to arm their vessels, could
'ntft afcrd any Foreign nation just cause of
offtHQte. He was nqt surprised that his
colleague (Mr. Harper) should be of a dif
ferent opinion, becaufc he did not think 'so
favourably of that nation, as many other
gentlemen did ; but he was surprised tp heqr
gentlemen who thought more favourably of
nation, confiderthe measure as operat
ing wholly against them. Surely means of
felt-defence could not be means of offence.
Nor could gentlemen fay that the French
nation was the only nation which committed
offences upon our trade. He had heard it
said that another nation had lately captured
an cquah a greater number of our
vtfiels, than they had done. Bcfides, as
the measure was intended more against un
lawful plunderers, than regular Seizures, he
could not conceive how it could be suppos
ed to give offence to arty particular nation,
or affeft any existing nrgociation. The on
ly point to be determined, then, was when
the hill should be committed. He thought
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Nicho
las) had carried his idea too far, when he
said, because this country-waff not prepared
for war, they ought not to discuss this ques
tion. He thought there wero certain time's
when every free nation aught to be prepar
ed for war. He meant Aylien the measure
of injuries had arrived at such a pitch, that
it could not be Iqnger borne. In such a cafe
a nationought to meet the calamities of war,
rather than to submit to farther oppressions.
If the proposed measure, therefore, us
in a better state for war, it .was a recommen
dation of it, as Strength, 3nd not Weakncfi,
was the best preservative against war ; as, if
a [people were prepared for war, nations
would be careful how they insulted them.
He wished, therefore, to put this country
into that finuation as soon as possible. To
poftpono the question so long a time as had
been would be a very unusual
measure. ft would look like a wish to get
rid of it altogether. Â«Whatever might be
the issue of the negociation, he said, we
ought to put ourselves in fopte posture of
defence for our trade ; for, whether there
were peace or war in Europe, there could
be no objection to the arming of our mer
chantmen in the way proposed. He hoped
therefore, the discussion would not be post
poned longer than the second Monday in
January.
Mr. Allen observed, that it had. been af
fei lid that there had bcen up ehange in dot
political fituatiou since the last session.
There was one, be said. It could not then
be determined whether the decree of th? 2d
of Martfb was really genuine, or whether
rhe letter of Merlig to our Consul was real
ly authorized by thÂ« Government of that
country: Now the fafts could not be doub
ted.â Mr. A. said, it had beeu injimated
that the friends of this measure, would be
glad to fruftrate the with
France. H? did not believe . any such in-
in the House. The
poftponeoftin proposed, inftcad of being
four wdeks,. as it had been called, lie said
would be 41 days.
Mr. Harper again explained the reasons
ofhjk.vote. H# differed froai the gentle
man last up with'refpeft to the reality of pa
pers he mentioned. He believed they were
last; session generally believed to be genuine.
Mr. S. Smith said, h?d he beeu present
when the former vote was taken, he should
have besn oppofad to t(\e discussion being
postponed to so diilant 4 day.; but as the
hoi;fe had-come to decision on the fubjeft,
he flibukl yPte against tha. qiieftion's being
recoo'tideretL- Hedi-j not consider the bill
before (hem giving the merchants the pri
vilege to arir. their vessels, but as -rertriftiog
vefTels armed from dojng mifchief.
He insisted upon it merchants had a right
to arm by law, notwithftandiug the Procla- '
mation of the President, which he was bold ,
to fay, he considered as illega l .
The question for a re-confideratiÂ«n of the
former vote, (which was carried 40 to 37,)
was negatived 44 to 38.
THURSDAY DSCEMBER 3s.
The Speiker l?.id before the honfe a letter
auJ report from the secretary of the 'fVea
fury, in purftuuce of a refoluiion of the
houfe of the 22(3 inft. relative to the claim
of General Kofciufko. The report ftateo,
that the accounts of the general were fet
tled at the Treasury in 1784, when a cer
tificate wa3 ifTucd to liimfor 12,280 dollars
and 49*90ths, bearing an interest of 6 per
cent from the ift January, 1784, which
wcis stipulated by a refoKition in February
following, in common wish the interest due
to all the foreign bfttctt's, to 6e paid annu
.ally at Paris ;
were granted by Congress to difeharge the
principal andintrrellof thofedebts, at which
time it was supposed that all the officers had
received their intfreft to the !ft January,
1789; but it now appeals by the banker's
account at Paris, that rjp'iniereft had been
received by General JÂ£ufciuflco for four
years, viz. from 1785 to Sufficient
funds to pay the interest from 1789 to '92,
were in 1752 placed m Amsterdam, fubjefl
to the disposal cff our minilterat Paris, that
by his direction a bill for theamount was re
mitted to Mr. Piackrtey, in London ; but
pnrfuant to the dire&ion of general Kofci
ufko, Mr. P. wrote to tbe bankers at Am
sterdam to remit the amount to Leipfic, or
Dresden. Whether this request was com
plied with, is not kuovvn ; general Kofei
ufko fays'he neverrcceived it : it therefore
lay fubjeft to his disposal at Amsterdam,
Leipfic or Dresden. iu September
1792, a notification was publiihed, that
provision had been made for paying the prin
cipal of the debt due to foreign officers, on
application at the Treasury, after the 15th
of O&ober following, and that the interest
upon their demands would cease after the
last day of.JDecember in that year. That
though the certificate ifTued to the general,
is dated by him to have been loft or destroy
ed, yet the powers of the officers of the
Treasury are competent to the payment of
12,280 dollars, 34 cents, the principal, and
2 >9+7 dollars, 33 cents iotereft, for the
years /rom 1785 to 1788,- on receiving a
bond of indemnification from the general ;
but that they cadnot adv*nÂ£e the interest
firppofed to have beeir tranfrtiitted to Leip
fic or Dresden, tlipugh payment will be
immediately made for any sum which may
be hereafter drawn, and credited to the U
nited States at Amsterdam ; nor is it in
the power, of the treasury to allow any in
terest 911 the said principal, fince 1 the iftof
January 1793.
On motion of Mr. Dawfon; this report
was referred to a co mmittee of the whole
for Monday. *
Mr. Varnum presented the petition of
M. Landais] a French gentleman who serv
ed the United States at sea, during the
war, praying for a settlement of a balance,
which he Bates to be due to him defer
red to the committee of claims.
Mr. W. Claiborne moved for the order
of the day on the report upon the remon
ftrjnce and petition of the Legislature of
TenncfTee.
Mr. Coit hoped the fubjeft might be de-'
ferred till to-morrow, as there 'was a faft
referred to in the report, which he wi filed
to liaye fornc information upon.
Upon the question being Rut,-the motion
was, however carried, and the house ac
cordingly resolved itfelf into a committee of
the whole on the fubjeft, "Mr. Kittera in
the chair, when the. following report of the
committee, *vas read :
" That, on investigating the causes of
complaint contained in the said Remon

pursuant to the treaty of Holfton, in tjie

were supposed to bÂ« on lands to which the

guished, appear to be within 4he Indian
territory. That those inhabitants had been
induced to believe that the lands which
they occupied were not within the Indian
boundary, in confequen.ee of the late Gov
ernor of the South Werftern Territory hav
ing, in pnrfuance of diredfiyns from the
Executive-os the United States, caused a
temporary line to be extended, by Comrnif
fioners appointed for that By
which line the settlements above mentioned
were included within the lands assigned to
the Territory South Weft of the Ohio
(now the State of Tenneifee.)
" The>committee I/kewife find, that there
are divers other citizens of the said state
who occupy lands, unquestionably within
the Indian a& designated .by the
said treaty, which lands they ppfTefs by vir-'
tue of titles derived from the Hate of N.
Carolina, previous to the cession of that
territory, by the said state, to the general
gbvernmeVit, tine condition of which cession
was, that " all entries made by, or grants Â«<>
" all and every person or persons whatfo

'â¢ The pommittee also are informed, thit
by the operation of the law, palled on the
19th day of May, 1796, for regulating the
intereourfe with the Indian tribes, which
law lias been carried into execution since

" Refolvedi that the sum of

or be difpofecfof in such other manner as

Mr. Coit said, the fadl upon which he
wanted information Was that refpedting the
temporary line which was said to have been
run. He wished- to know what evidence the
committee had before them on (his fubjeÂ£t.
Mr. Pinckney (the chairman of the fe
,leÂ£t committee) said, that the testimony
which they had received on thfs fubjedt, was
frt>m the member from that diftridt, which
was corroborated by that of a member of
the senate from that state, who said he had
his information from the governor of the
south-western territory himfelf. This cir
cumltance was not particularly noticed in
the application made to the secretary of
war ; only fgeneral information was called'
for, and lie was silent as to this point.
Mr. Coit thought official information
ought to hÂ»e been had.
Mr. W. Claiborne said, he had applied
to the Secretary at war oh this fubjedt, and
received for answer from him, that his gene
ral report to the committee of the Senate
contained all the informatinn proper' to be
communicated; ichen, therefore", he found
this information was not contained in the
report, he supposed i; was fueh as he did
not think proper to communicate. The fadl,
he said, was well known in the state of Ten
nessee, and it wasgenerally received'opin
ion, that the line had been extended,by the
President. He himfelf was in habits of in
timacy with the commissioners, and Ire had
more than once heard the fadt from them.
He believed gentlemen from North-Caroli
na and Virginia were also acquainted with
it. He did not, however, believe the fadt
essential. If it were a truth that there were
citizens in the state of Tennessee who had
been forced to abandon possessions fairly ob
tained from the state of N. Carolina, it was
. fufficient to warrant any measure which
(hould be calculated to afford them imme
diate and adequate relief.
Mr. Pinckney was in h6pes the testimo
ny upon which the committee had adted,
would have proved fatisfa&ory to the gen
tleman from Connedticut, but he feerned to
think they Ought to have had official docu
ments. If that gentleman had attended to
the report of the Secretary of War, he
would have seen that any farther application
by them for information, would have been
improper, as (he Secretary there declared
the business to be " of a nature exclusively
executive 'and that he there gaVe as much
information on the fubjedt as he thought
neceftary. If the evidence upon which tlpe
committee had adted, was not thought fuf
ficient, the house would, of course, call for
fiich other as they might think proper.
Mr.-Macon had no objection to any other
information being obtained. It might be,
however, that the information communicat
ed by the member of tt|e Senate, was offi
cial, gs one of thofegentlemen had been in an
official charadter.
Mr. Pinckney said the member of thÂ«
Senate whom he had alluded to, was Mr.
Jackson.
Mr. Blount had no doubt but the infor
mation required, might be obtained from
the Secretary of' War ; and, if the commit
tee were to rife, he (htfuld make a motion
to that effect. He had himfelf been told
that the line in queftiop was run, by the
commissioners who ran it ; and hi had been
flrewn by a gentleman who attended tht
running of it, the diredtion it t6ok. How
it happened that the Secretary of War had
not mentioned it, Tie was at a fofstcj know.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) moved that
the committee rife, in ordfr to obtain the
information required. It appeared to him
that they had been premature in going into
a committee of the whole. He recplledted
something of the line of experiment being
run, and of the Indi<!!Â» being diffatisfied
with it. He understood also, that in conse
quence of the diffatisfadtion of the Indians,
tfyere was an additional allowance made
to them. Of this, however, he was not ve
ry certain.
Mr. N. Smith hoped the committee
would rife, in order that the information
wanted might be obtained from the Secreta
ry bf War. He did not believe that the
line of experiment was run by the diredtion
of the Executive, because he did not think
the Executive''would direÂ£t any other line
to be run than . such as was prescribed by
treaty. At the fame time, he would not
be understood to discredit the information
given. Gentlemeu did not fay they knew
the ffc.a tbemfelves, but that it was general
ly uiulerjwd.to.be Ui. There wre'many
things said. to bt uudsrjhod, in that quarter,
-with reipedt to which the people ought to
be undeceived. He believed this to be one
of those things. He did not believe the
Secretary Sf.War had declined giving in
formation as to this point, because it inter
fered; with Executive buiinefs, as it was
merely'to know whether a certain thing had
been done by Executive authority, or not.
The e were many things in the remonstrance
and petition, with which the Executive
conceived the legislature had no.tl)iiig to do;
but, as to the point in question, there could
be no objection to giving the information
required,MS'. HarpJr had no chjfc&ion to the com
mittee's riling for this information, though
he did not want it ; because, he thought
there was fufficient reason for adopting the
resolution. The faiS of the people's being
w'the distressed iituation mentioned in the
report, was a good reason for agreeing -to
it, though it fhoiild appear that the Exec
utive did not give orders for the running of
the temporary line.
Mr. Pinckney had no ohje&ion to the
motion, though he did not think jt necefla
ry. It was clear the line was run by order
of the Governor of the Sotith Western Ter
ritoiy, and whether he had orders from the
Executive to do it, was to him immaterial,
as the people who were in pofleflion of the
Ijnd, supposed, of course, that the Gover
nor was authorised to do what he did.
Mr. Nicholas did not think it material,
in the present question, whether or not, the
Governor had the authority of the United
States for what he did. It could not be
cxpe&ed thatthe" peoplefhould call upon the
Governor to (hew the authority by which
he afted. It was thefame thing to the peo
ple, whether he was or was not, dÂ«ly au
thorized.
Mr. M'Dowell did not think the information
1 eqtlircd would be of any use. There could be no
doubr the line of experiment was run by order
Df the governor, agreeably to the direiSlions of the
txecutive. It was also well known that liauhhbead,
and a party of indians, came down to Philadelphia,
to malic their complaints, wilh refpeft to it, and
that 5.000 dollars had been given to them by way
of farisfaiftion. llle persons who were now dri
ven into the woods, and fuffeting the inclemencits
of the season, had fettled upon the land from
which they were driven, under expreC. TitUs from
the (late of N Carolina, previous to the period 6f
running this line. The only question was, whe
ther the people had a right to fettle where they
had done, and whether the United States had a
right to remove them. He believed the diftrefie*
of people called for immediate relief, and
.thifc juftiee andpotfey required that it fbould be
granted.
Mr. N. Smith thought it was of importance to
know whether a fa&, which had been reported by
the committee, was founded, or not; and thÂ»t. it
would be very wrong to Tend out to the world as
true, a thing which wis not true. But it also ap
peared to him an important faft in the inveftiga
tion of -this fubjetft. If these people had aay
claim upon the United States, it was in confe
rence of the United Stares having led them into
a miilake ; but if others had led them into it, it
was to them ought to look for redress. He
would agree, that whatever the governor of the
South Western Teritory had done, in the line of
his duty, the United States were bound by it; but
the running of this line, except he were ords-ed
to do it, was not a part of his duty, and they
were not, therefore, bound by it. Mr. S. said,
he rose principally to correrSt an alTertion which
had been made, that these persons had a claim up
on (he United States, from having titles to their !
land from the state of N. Carolina. It would be i
found that they did not claim protection on this
ground. There were two descriptions of claims;
one from persons who had a grant from N. Caro
lina; the other from persons who went on to a
spot of ground, bccaufe they believed it to be the
property of the United States, from a certain tem
porary iine which hid been run, and who wero
now, when the permanent line was run, obliged
to remove. The iatte/ had no real claim to the
land they occupied. .
. Mr. Goodrich was in favor of the committeerif. 1
ing, that the wi(hed-for information might be
obtained. Great refpeA was doubtless due to the
testimony of the gentleman from TenneAetJ; but, 1
if it should appear that no orders had been given
by the executive for the runningof-the. temporary
line, it would lhew, that an officer of the govern
ment h*d yiuilaimul 'that -for a faft which was
not so. He, therefore, thought the fa<St ought to
be ascertained.
Mr. W. Claiborne said, he had just seen 3 fen- '
ator who had been so the war department, and
â who informed hmi,he hadfeen the letter of the fe- ;
cretary of war to the governor cf the South Wes
tern Territory, (lire&ing him to run the line of
cij:orimfnt. and also the governor's answer,
wherein he fpoUc of the bulintfs having been done, j
He gave this information, in order to do away the ;
suspicions which gentlemen seemed to have of the
tiuth of the testimony which had been given to
thcfele& coma- itteeon thisfubjed.
The motion for the committee's riling was put
and carried : it rose, and had leave to fit again.
Mr. Blount then proposed a resolution for the
adoption of the house, calling upon the frcretary
of war for such information as he may be pofteffed
of, relative to the running of the temporary line,
which was agretd to.
Mr. Macon presented a petition from several
inhabitants of this city, praying for the liberation
from prison of capt. W. Bell, who is confined at
the suit of the United States, for duties: they
fpeakof him as " a worthy man, a good citizen,
and a valuable member of society," luffuring from
his having had too good an opinion of Mr. Rit
tenhoufe, for whose debt he fu(Ters.âReferred to
the committee of commerce and manufa^ures.
Mr. Spraguc presented a petition from certain
invalid pensioners of New-Hamplhire, praying
that their pensions might commence from the con

Before any order was made upon this petition the
house Adjourned.
NEW-YORK, December 16.
The late banilhmentof certain deputies from
France-is found to be so convenient a mode ps
ridding the republic of men that government
does not like, that one Theremin has undertak
en, before the conftitutiona! circle, to reduce
Ostracism to a system. He has proposed a pio
jeiS in which he has Great Ostracism, Little
Ostracism, and Departmental Oftraeifm.
The rapid and bold flrides of the present gov
ernment to force ill France into fubmifiioa to
their measures, greatly alarm the citizens, and
their measures are openly but cautiously opposed;
But the press is so (hackled that the oppolers of
the Dire&ory dare little more than express their
opinions with modefl doubts and queries.
Never was a people so completely under the
yoke as the French, ia a state called FREt. All
the prefies are under the infpe&iofl and control
of government âall civil and military officers,
not of the party of theDireilÂ«ry,are removedâ
in every part of France, tbe milifary are at |
hand to suppress the lealt murmur aguinfl the
l/?.afures of the present government âful'pedle.l
persons arc every day arretted imprifonad.
A projetf is before tKe French legislature for
reducing the interest of the national debt. The
reporter maintains that it will be an advantage
to the creditors as well as the public ; as it will
enable the state to pay them. It will relieve
the Republic of an intolerable burthen and
give ntrves to the state by enabling it to
meet its engagements, railing the value of its
paper and thus restoring credit.
The whole propofltion is not before us ; but
from the debate we colleift, that the project is,
to reimburse thecrcditov a part of the principal
by delivering to them national property valued
by Creter, the reporter, at one Milliard*? 394
millions. By this redufliun, the nation will li-
Kent? a large portion of their revenue f*otrj the
payment of interest am) eu'ahle tits state to pay
lire rcfnlue i*jth punci u j lity j at the fame rime
(iic- creditor would be put in poffefiion of apart
ef his capital.
Vernier defended the resolution. He dated
the prel'ent interest of the deht to be 380 mil
lions annually, and the ordinary eXpences of
government 300 millionsâtotal 680 millionsâ
ajfuin, he said, which, in time of peace, would
he beyond the abilities of the republic. He \vaÂ»
for the reduction of the debt.
Citizen Lecoz, Conftitutiona! Bishop of Ren
nes, and the President of the council at Paris,
have notified the Legifiature of their taking the
oath of haired to royalty and anarchy and their
attachment to the republic and the conftitutioh
of the third year. On this the Editor of the
Clef du Cabinet remarks,he wilhes others would
do the fame and put in pradlice the ho!y com
raands, Render to Csefar what belongs to him I
and " submit to the powers that he;" asking
at the fame time, farcoftically, " who will dare
to fay tjie French RepubHe is not a fowei ?"â 
The French Minift<rs have adopted the roy
al stile of doiitÂ£ bufcjefs. It is announced in
the Paris prints, that thÂ« Minister of war will
give public audiences the 4th and Sth day of
each decade from two o'clock till four. He
will receive the representatives of the people
and General Officers, the id and 6th day of the
decade from noon till two o'clock.
The Minister of Justice gives public audien
ces on the jth and 9th flays from two till four.
The French papers contain ar. anecdote of
General Willot, one of the bamlhed deputies,as
follows. One of his friends consoling him on
his fate,told him that transportation is a penalty
agaiuft \vhiÂ«h he could at any time appeal, and
that peace would set him free. Willot replied,
" ah my friend, c'eft.la mer a boire 1" It is an
ocean to drinkâor it is to drink the oceaU.
The Paris Moniteur contains l'ome remarks
inoppofition to the projeifl of exiling all the Bi
bles. It is remarked that the measure will drive
from France a large quantity of specieâand oc
casion great diftreis. Many will felt their goods
and remove to foreign countries, with their, ci
pitals, others will bury their money for fear of
a like fate, from whence will ref'ilt a total loft
of moneyâconfidence will be extinguilhed, and
bufmefs fuffer a total stagnation.
Chenier opposed the baniftiment of th? no
bles in mass, bflt propoftd their exctuiion from
all public offices. He his speech with
these wordsâ" Nobles and not people, ire ne*
ceflary to fopport a monarchyâa peopJe,,and
siot nobles,are yceffary to maintain aÃepublir."
A writer in a French paper makes the follow
ingjudieious observations. " Those who drive
to revive public fpirif, by harlh means know not
what they wilh, nor what they do. Hitherto
public spirit has been a sentiment of hatred for
all that hai existed âthere ought immediately
to be an attachment to that which now exijlsâ
the present objedl is to render the re public as
dear, as the old government was odious. Such
a change is not the work of a moment.
The citizens will not be attached to a system
of representation ; will not be reconciled to the
laws, until they have been happy under them.
It would be absurd to cxpedl from them an ar
dent zeal, while their commerce languifees,
while their fields are ill cultivated, while the ri
gor of circumftames (hall force from some their
children, from others their fortunes. But 1
repeat itâthis zeal is not neceflary. The ne
cessity of repose is now the general fentimentâ
a sentiment which alone can spare the citizens
new druggies and new misfortunes.

COMMUNICATION.
Whatever were the motives which influ
enced the majority of a certain great affera
bly to decide in favor of postponing the dis
cussion of a highly important measure, it
will be ascribed by the world to the fear of
offending a foreiga nation. Among that
majority are some to whom this principle
cannot be imputed ; but their views will be
confounded by their rotes, awl their adver
saries will exult in every temporary fchifrn,
fcrclires tO them fckÂ« tariumpK of opp" i
fition which never divider. In a country like
ourÂ», it is itlways bad policy to johroppofi
tion, because it has heretofore prevailed in
the fame contest. If measures are to be ac
commodated to a bad precedent for the fake
of preserving an appearance of cesififtency ;
the encouragement to attempt the eftablifk
ment of futfh a preccdeM will be mightily
increased. To support a firm and virtuous
adminiftratton, against the intrigues and ac
tivity of its enemies, is a talk to be accom
plished only by labour, vigilance and perse
verance. If it be ascertained, that the fede
ral phala nx when once foiled will never ral
ly, but that its members will be likely to de
sert and join the aflailants y vti 6nfet of fac
tion will be more impetuous, and finally ir
resistible. On the contrary defeat fkould be
a new incentive to union and resistance.
Men who are confident in the fitnefs of their
own plans, should never defilt until they are
put into executionâSometimes the popular
outcry may be excited, and the fears and
paflions of men will often be roused by those
who are in the praftice of juggling the mul
titude. But the slight-os-hand which moves
the mob, has not yet the command of the
" French national razor."" The moderation
of the people leads them to acquiesce in the
decisions of their government j and 'their
good sense ultimately approves of wife mea
sures which a. sudden impulse may have
prompted them at firft to oppose and con
demn.
At present the people are ripe for the
measure of arming our merchantmenâTheir
representatives are not.
MR. TENNO,
To quiet the merchant* who consider the
attempt to prevent them from defending their
o<wn property as a violation of it tonftitution
al right, the idea is held out that the Uni
ted States will indemnify them for conse
quent lofies. But this aft of justice does not
intirely fatisfy the patriot who looks to the
general good at well as at bis personal interejl

A letter from generaf Waffeffa, SfHTSnnc
es that hostilities are commenced by the ar
my of Italy.
[ The date of this Paris article is omitted
according to an inconvenient pra&ice in the
departments, but we may suppose it two
days anterior to the date of the Rouen pa
per, which is the 21ft of Oftofter. Two
days from Paris to Rouen and ten for Udine
will give the 9fh for the departure of the
Couiier from Udine,âthe latest account
from that place, and about the time when
the anniftice was to expire.}
An article from Constantinople relates a
that appears incredible. An old Jan
izary of 70, with his wife, had beep in the
prafticeof collefting young persons of good
flefh, and inhumanly murdering them, for
the purpose of melting their fat and making
a fpccies of ointment, from the sale -of
which they made great profit. They were
detested in the aft of killing a young Ar
menian of 15 or 16 years old, and hung
before the door of the House.
Accounts frctn Milan (not dated, but in
a Ronen paper of the 17th Oft.) (late that
the equipage of the French general in. chief
had left that city, and the Polilegion hsd
lef Bologna to app:Â»iah nearer to the thea
tre of hostilities.

ARRIVAL AT MARBLEHEAD.
On Wednesday lift arrived at Marblehead,
fehooner , capt. RujTell, 51 dayi from
Bourdeaux. Capt. R. had furnifhed fcimfclf
with French papers, which probably were to
the latter part of OiSofeer, but loft them by
falling in with three Englilh frigates.
Rumours of the aftion between the Dutch
and Englift fltets were current, but not regular
or circumstantial. _ There was no profpedl ot a
speedy peace, although it was not known that
hostilities had actually rrtommenced between
France and Auftiia. A favorable change in
the personal treatment #f Americans in Bour
deaux was noticeable ; but it is not knswn to
what it ought to be attributed. Cottoa, Coffee
and Tobacco, bore good prices at Bourdeaux.

PITTSBURGH, December 16.
We noticed in our last, the arrival of the
commander in chief of the army. We are
informed that the roÂ«te by which he came
from the Wabafh and Western Pods, was
through a pathless wilderness of near 400
miles, and the fevered weather of the feafonj
he found the snow eighteen inches deep at
the Tufcarawas, on Monday the 4th inft.
during which day Farenheit's Thermometer
stood at 6 o'ctyck a. m. at 3 0 , at noon at
at 4 0 , and at 6 o'clock p. m. at o.
We learn with pleasure, that the Gener
al enjoys good health, although he has lain
near two months under a canvass roofâWc
tinderftand also, that the discontents at Kaf
tkafkias had been entirely quelled by the
presence of Col. Sargent at that placeâthat
tranquility reigned every where, and that
by the last accounts from captain Guion he
had reason to expeft the speedy pÂ«(Teffion of
the ports of Natchezâthat by the General's
afliduty and adroitness a temper had been
produced, and a state of thing 3 eftablilhed
among the Indians which proraifes lasting
and permanent peaceâasthe strongest proof
of this,-the celebrated Miami chief, Little
Turtle, â¢ accompanied the General thus far
011 his way to visit his now acknowledged
Father, the President of the United States.

New-Theatre,
December if, 1797.
THE Managers particularly rcqu-ft the con
currence of the public in the abolition of a
cuflom which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
way or disposing of RETURN CHECKci at the
Theatre.
They are aware that gentlemen are unconscious
of airy wrong done to the interest of the inftttu
tipnby this prafl ice, from a general, though mis*
taken ide.t th.it Checks are the reprefentativas of a
right so so many feats in tke Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will;
when in faift, they were never intended as more
than tdtns by which the Door-keepers are enabled
to afcortain with thv' I'aft trouble to
tley tlemfelvts haw !,eea before in or
paid for their adniiirioii.
Independent of the iijury tlia .".lanagefs fullain,
such a ( prafiice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other dlforderly persons to furroutid the doors of
the '1 ht-a're, to the aorruption bfpkeiif movaU and
the great annoyauce of the Audiettat.
It has also been Wit foutce of two evils of no in
ccnfidcrablc magnitude; one is tjrat fjnietimes
ve-y iropropsr company is by tltefe'mians admit
ted ; and the other, that owin; to Checks passing
into difhonelt hands, they have be n frequenaly
counterfeited to a large amount for the purpoks of
Sale.
This ftatentent will, it is refpedlfully hoped, in
duce the Public to discourage such a traffic : and
the exertions of the Managers will, if thus a Gifted,
easily prove adequate to its entive abolition
