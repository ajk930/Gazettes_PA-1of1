the quarter ending the 3 ill of March lalt,
which was ordered to be prinkd. do

I Mr. Sewall presented an address to the th
j fame effeft frcm Salem, Maflachufeits. fh:
Mr. Sprigg also ptefented an addrefa of ni
a similar kind, from Upper Marlborough, in tj
Prince George, Maryland. an
j Thefs addre(fts were severally referred as he
I usual. Pc
â  Mr. Hartley obtained leave of absence w
i for Mr. Thomas for a weik. th
Mr. Wadsworth presented a petition th
from a number at ma(lÂ«rsof vessels praying r_>
for the ere&iou of a light house on Penob- hi
scot Bay. Referred to the Secretary of the pi
Treasury. th
Mr. Flndley said, the situation of his at
family laid him under the necessity ofafking
leave of absence for the remainder of the in
feflion. He said he fliould have aflced this ;1\
leave some time ago, if jt had not been for j si
' the hotice*v!iich the gentlenan from S. Ca- ! rr
rolina (Mr. Harper) gaÂ»e some weeks iince, I d
that he meant to accuse him at the bar of the c
f house, on account of some letter of hi 3 which o
' he { Mr. H.) referred to. He did not know
precisely the letter spoken of. He had leen I
1 a letter in one of the papers of the city with b
| his name to it, which he was neither prepa- 0
3 red to acknowledge nor deny. But, in or- \
' der to give the gentleman time to bring this i
â matter forward, if he (hall think proper, he 1
would ask leave after Friday next. As to t
o the manner in which that gentleman had
in roduced this business, h should fay no (
thing. He was not afraid of fuffering in <
the pub'ic ellimation from any thing which 1
s that gentleman might fay of him.
| Mr. Harper had no objection to the gen- t
J. tleman's having leavp after the day he had 1
g mentioned, or any other. As to the charge
0 he had mentioned it to be his intention of
S> bringing forward against that gentleman, it
:s required so.Tie time to colleft the neceflary j
evidence to support his charge ; and he al- j
d, so stated, when he intro uced the fubjeft, j
< that it was not his intention to interrupt the >
:e public business with it. He had received;
the neceflary teilimony, and as soon as the
house had patTed on all the public measures
_ before it, if the gentleman was then in his
feat, he (hould bring the matter forward. If
o- not, he (houid of course, take no farther no- j
sI tice of it.
Mr. FI ndley did not know whether mo
e" tions of thi* kind were in order ;if they
were, the house might expeft them frequent
tB ly to be made. If the fubjeft was brought
before the house, they would judge whether
it was proper for their deliberation, or not,
and what kind of teilimony would be fuffi
cient to substantiate the charge. He had
never asked leave of abfelice from his duty
since he came into the public service before
Â® lall summer, when the iitu&tios of his fami
ly made it nJceflary ; he was sorry that the
fame cause called him home at prcfent.
Leave was granied.
The Speaker laid before the house
nd communication fr m the General Pod Office :
.0- ; n a r,lwer to the enquiries made as to the j
conveyance of the mail to Kentucky and j
Tenneflee, which was referred to the com
mittee 011 Poll Offices and Fed Roads.
1 a The house again resolved itfelf into a
on committee of the whole on Ihe bill for au
lte thorizing the President of the United States
44 to raise a provilional army ; when the ques
tion being put on the fcftion providing for
the calling out 20,000 militia at a time to
be trained and disciplined, it was negatived,
N , there being only 11 votes for it.âThis sec
tion was objedted to on the ground that the
constitution has placed the training and dis
ciplining of the militia in the feve al dates,
and that Cohgrefs had power only " to.pro
â vide for calling forth the militia to execute
the laws of the union, suppress infurre&ions,
m- and repel invalion ; rcferving to the dates
ira respeCtively the appointment of the officers,
' and the authority of training the mill ia ac
,T cording to the (Jifc pline prelcribed by Con
ty, S refs -"
all The two neV feflions recommended by
-A the felefit committee were agreed to as fol
ib- lows, with very few observations upon them :
>P" " That it shall be lawful for the President
1,11 of the United States, at his discretion, upon
the requed of any military corps edablidied
f by law, ia any date, disposed to inform
themfeltes in the use of artillery ; or of the
executive df any (late, in behalf of such
corps, to fuffer to be loaned to them, such
pieces, not exceeding two, to any one corps,
gis of the fitfld artillery of the United States, as
feet may be moll conveniently spared, to be tak
lts en. removed and returned, at the expense of
t ' le the the party requelling ; who are to be ac
countable for the fame, and to give rece pts
e according'} - ."
" 'That the President of the United " tatea Mi
shall be, and he is hereby authorized, when be
under his orders, a y por ion of the militia, coi
or any volpntccr corps, (hall be called forth , my
and engaged in the aftual service of the U- pi-i
nited States, to fuffer to be loaned, at the V.
requell of the executive of the date from wc
which such militia shall be called forth, or of coi
such volunteer corps appearing to be una. th'i
voidably deficient, afupply of field artillery,
arms and accoutrements, from the arfenalsof ftr,
the United StateÂ», as the cafe may require ; for
proper receipts and ftcurity being given, to thi
be accountable to return'tlie fame, the acci- pr<
dents of fervi e excepted." cle
The next f.-ftion recommended to be a- cei
dopted was in the following-words : he
â Â« That the President of the United States pn
shall be, and he is hereby authoriz-d to ca .fe pr
to be purchased and procured a quantit 1 -' 01 tci
caps, swords, or fahres, and pillols with hoi- th;
ders, not exceeding what may fufficient br
for four thoufaud cavalry, and t ' be depo- as
sited in the parts of the United States, th
where he shall deem it mod convenient, for
the fupplv of any corps of cavalry which ju
shall be called into adual service of the U- vv
rvi ed States, and which the President of the th
United States hiay loan upon the terms H
and the like receipts to be accountable, as j ca
herein befor - provided. And for this pur- ol
pose, aid towards defraying the cxpences di
which may be necessarily incurred before cc
the next feflion of Cougrefs, in executing tl
the other purposes of tliis aÂ£l, a sum, nor ex- m
exceeding dollars, IhaH be, and is rc
hereby appropriated, and shall and m vbe t(
paid at the Trelfury. under the orders of t(
the President of the United States, out of F
any money, not already appropriated.'' it
Mr. Sewall moved to si.l up the blank ] t
in this feftion 900,000 dollars, lie ;tl
supposed 50 or 60,000 dollars would be fuf- 1 a
| ficicnt for purchasing the accoutrements a
I mentioned ; the remaining 140 or J 50,000 j
| dollars, would be rea y in the l'reafury in j t
cafe of emergency, for the other purposes li
of the aÂ£l. j f
This mode ot proceeding was objected to. f
It was thought by some that it woulJ be , t
bell to appropriate only for ,ihe purchase j
of the articles fpecified, and provide for the t
whole expence of carryidg the aft into effeft 1 c
in one sum, either in this law or some other ; <
but it was finally carried as it danda, and ; t
the blank was filled with 200,000 dollars. | 1
1 The last additional feftion proposed for \ ]
exempting private soldiers from arrefl for ;
1 debt or contra-1, during their term of fer
-1 vice, was then agreed to.
The original bill i felf was now returned
- to, and the firft and second feftions having
I been agreed to, the third, which Was in the
! following words, came under view :
f " That, in addition to the afortfaid number
t oj troops, the President is iereby empowered,
f j ij in his opinion the public inter ejlfhall require,
â  j to accept of any company or companies of Wan
, ! teers, either of artillery, cavalry or infantry, \
e ; who may afjoc\nte und offer themselves for the
d \ service, who fhzll be armed, clothed end equip
e pe<i at their own expence, and wbofe commifft
-8 oned officers the President is hereby aulhoriztd
s to appoint; who shall be liable to be called upon
f to do military duty at any time the Prfident'fhall 1
)- ' judge proper, and when called into aÃ'ualfe/- |
â vice, and while â¢â¢ em,lining in the fame, shall
)- be under the fume rues and regu attons, and
y shall be entitled to thefame pay, rations, forage,
t and emoluments of every Una, excepting bounty
it and clothing, as the other troops to be raised by
:r this act. Provided, Such vo unteirsfhdU not
t, be liable to do duty in any place, but in the slates
i- to which they rcfpelliv ly belong, or in an ad
d jacentfate."
y Mr. Harrison moved to strike out the
e words, " and whose commiifioned officers
i- the Prefi ent is hereby authorized to ap
le point." As he supposed these volunteers
would be confidcrcd in Lhe light of militia,
as they would be included in the cenfua of
a ' citizenship ; and if so, it would be uncon
:e I ditutiot.a. for the President to appoint the
ie | officers, as their appointment was exclufive
d i ly veded in the individual ftate-. A further
1- i reason induced him to this amend i.ent. The
President, ft is well known, is Commander
a in Chief of the militia when they are called
i out; but he would not be Commander of
es these corps, except called into the field,
f- Mr. Varnum moved to ltrike out the
>r whole feftion. It app.ared to him that
â  0 permi ting volunteers to arrange themselves
d, in f parate companies would have a bad ef
c- feft upon the mi itia; for as they would
ie chiefly be the moll sprightly young men who
f- entered into the volunteer corps, there will
s, be lcfs spirit left in the remainder of the mi
-- litia to perfeft themselves in military difci
te pliue. He knew that the introduction of
is, vounteer corps into the militia of Maffa
es chufetts was thought to have produced a bad
â s, effeft. Many of them have been discharged
c- and he believed they went into the corps to
n- which they belonged as regular militiamen.
Befidcs, he thought there was a privilege
5y granted to these men, which ought not to be
il" granted to any citizen of the United States.
1 : They are not liable to do duty in any place
nt bat in the State to which they belong, or in
jn an adjacent date ; aud the President was'au
ed thorized to accept of these volunteer corps
m to any amount. What would be the confe
he quence ? The greatest part of the militia
ell would join these eoips, and by that means
ch be excused from duty, except in their own
us, or an adjoining date- This could not be
as proper. \Hc looked upor. it as injurious to
k- the citizens at large, for any class to be thus
of exonerated from duty. He thought it di
1C- reftly in the face of the conllitution of the
jts United States. [Mr. V. read the contlitu
tional provision with refpeft to the militia.
[Volume XIII
Mr. V. supposed tli-fe volunteers could not
be called any tiling else but militia. 1 hey
could not be looked upon as a part ot the ai
my ; no (landing force would ever have thd
privileges granted to these volunteers. Mr.
V. hoped the time was not come when it
would be thought neceffiry to violate the
confliiution in order to raise up a defence for
the country.
Mr. Sumter seconded the motion for
firiking out the whole fcÂ£tion. He took it
for.granted that when gentlemen compound
this provision with the Conllitution, its im
propriety would appear. Nothing was raore
clear than that the appointment of the offi
cers of the milit : a is vetted in the Hate, and
he was furpriled that an attempt like the
ptefent Ihould be made to violate so clear a
provision of the Cqriftitution. Without en
tering at large into the lubjeft. he traded
that it would at once appear so Arrant i
breach of.the rights of the Individu-d States,
as not to be countenanced by any member of
the committee.
Mr. Dana observed, that the gentleman
jutl fat down had that this feÂ£tion
was so violent a breach of the Conllitution
that no one would be ft'uf d to support it.'
He Ihould, hovvever, be in favour ot it, be
i eatife he did not believe it violated any rule'
of the conllitution ; and .he re.ifon why lie
did not think so was, that he could not
conl.der these volunteer co ps as a part of
the militia. If there be any charaQeriititf
marks by whiqh to a.militia ftom
regulars, it is that the former are compelled
to serve, and the litter enter voluntarily in
to the service. This bid provides that the
President, if the public interell (lia!l require
ir, fha'l accepl of any company of volun
teers who may oiler tliemfelves, armed, clo<
; thed and equipped, at their own expence,
j and therefore they could not be conlidered
as militia.
These volunteer corps, until calld in o
j the field, will receive no pay, but they will
learn the military exercise aud difciphne, and
| surely gentlemen will not coniider the con
stitution violated because these persons chufe
to perform this previous service without pay.
j These corps would clearly be enlilled into*
: 1 the public service, whenever they made an
: offer of themlelves, and that offer was ac
; cepted ; but, because they clothe and equip
I themselves, and receive no pay except when
called into service, certain privileges are pro
- i pofid to be allowed to them which not
r allowed tootVer soldiers. Phis he thought
- fair, as these volunteer corps would furnilH
an army in readinefa for any emergency, and
1 without expence until the emergency ar
r rives.
e But the gentleman from Massachusetts
supposes, that the admission of these corps
r will operate an injury to the militia, by ta
I, king from it thole young men who are belt
qualified to make-good soldiers. This ob
-- jeftion, Mr. D. said, was contrary to expe
i, i vience both in the militia and army, were
\e volunteer corps have been admitted. Indead
>- of injuring the militia, he believed it would
t- be the means cf transf'ifing a military ardour
d into them, from feeing it exill in these corps,
n \ as they would be unwilling to be outdone in
11! (kill and discipline by the volunteer corps.
- | It would not injure a good militia, and it
// might improve a bad one.
d If there be militia volunteer corps, well

tj make an offer of their service to the Prill
]>y dent, they wili be accepted, and when call

ts in the service of the Unite' States. BuJ if
J- there be other companies ot militia whowoukl
wish to make art off;r of their service, but
le who have no confidence in their officers, it
rs would be proper that the President Ihould
p- give them other and better officers,
rs Mr M'Dowell fiid, that the gentle
i, man lad up had observed, tl.at to admit these
)f men in the way propo'ed would not be a vi
i- olation of the conllitution, because they are
le volunteer corps. What he meant he did nÂ«t
e- clearly utideilland. He thought it was a
;r violation of the express words, and more
ie particular'}' i<f ihe ipiÂ«it of the conllitution.
zr It was declared expressly in the conllitution
:d that the oflicers ot the. mill* ia Ihould be apÂ»
us pointed by the several dates, and these men
could not be considered any ether thin mili
le tia, until they were enlilled into the service
at of the United States.
es Mr. M'D. waseenain. that drawing the
f_ active young men from tlie militia into these
Id corps, would have the effecl which had been
io mentioned; besides that it w.uld break in
ill upon brigades and dmlions in a manner
li- which would create great inconvenience, and
ii_ dellroy the good order of the militia,
of Mr. Harper did not think it necessary te
a- go into any lengthy arguments to refute the
nd conllitutianal objeftion which hadbeen made,
ed This relied upon a matter of fail, viz. wile
to ther these voluntary corps we.e io be conti
n. dared as militia or regular troops. If tlity*
ge are militia, it is certain the Prelident cannot
be appoint the officers âif they are r-gulars, he;
is. ce tai.nly can. []Mr. M'Dowell asked where
ce the gentleman would (hew the enlillment.]
in The diftindl property of militia is tlwsââ¢
u- They are obliged to perform military duty,
â¢ps whilst the service to be pe formed by thefs
fe- volunteers was an aft of their own. I hefe
t;a volunteers, then, are to be conlidered as re_
ins gular troops. But ft wN.
ivn Car. linaafked where he found the enhdment.
be It was true he did not find the wo;d, but lie
to found the thing. They offe'ed their service
ius to the President in numbers, and it ,made no
di- difference in fa'ft whether the offer of service
:he was thus made, or individually. What, said
tui he, is an en'illment ? It ii an engagement
lis. to perform military service for a limitedtime. ThiÂ» these vojunteetl woald engage, |
and their making the engagement in a body I
would Hot be less effe&ual than if they were
to do it individually. When soldiers are
enlisted in the usual way, they receive boun
ty, clothes and equipments, and immediate
pÂ«y. Thefr volunteers are to receive none
of these, but orily pay when in a&ual ser
vice, and therefore it iÂ» provided they mail
not be called out of their own (late, except
loan adjoining state ; that they (hall chufe
their own officers, and that those officers
shall be appointed by the Prcfident. And
would any gen'leman fay thai the United
State* have sot a right 10 make a contrast
with men in this way ? He believed they
could not seriously fay so. Will . hefe vol
unteers be less soldiers, on account of the
different terms upon which they are engag
ed ? Are they not to be fubjeft to the fame
regulations and military command, and in
all refpefts to be trea rd and looked upon
as soldiers? Except that their officers will
be appointed by themselves, and they are !
not to be marched beyond an adjo ning state, !
they will be as much >egular soldiers as the '
armies of France or Austria.
But the gentleman froT Virginia (A'lr.
Harrifon) said they could not be confiaered
as a part of the army, because they would
remain citizens, and be includsd in tne cen
sus. He was himfelf rriftaken if regular
troops were excluded from the census. He
believed the fuldier was as much a citizen ad
that gentleman or himfelf. Suppose the
proposed army of 10,000 men were to be
raised, would they not be entitled to all ihe
rights of citizenship to which they would
have been eatitled had they not become sol- i
diers? They certainly would.
As to he expediency of the measure, he 1
fliould not go into many observations upon
that fubj'-ft. It was said that the raifingof
these corps would derange the militia; but
gentlemen will recolle that this is only a
temporary eniiftment, and when the period
of service is elapsed, these persons will go
back into their ranks in the militia. The
militia would be no more deranged, he be
lie'td, by the forming of these corps, than
it will be by the railing of the Provisional
Army. And will no bentfit arise from the
return of these men into the ranks of the
Militia ? Yes, they will carry with them
their military knowledge and experience,
which would be transfufed into the whole
militia corps, and being wrll armed and ac
coutred, a spirit of emulation would be ex
ci'.ed in the rtft of the militia to become e
qually so, These men will also be well fit
ted to become officers and military inftruflorS
in the militia.
What benefit i>ould accrue in the mean
time ? The country would have the advan
tage of a large body of troops who would re
ceive no pay, except in time of service. And
is not this an objeÂ£l worth obtaining ? Will
those gentlemen who are so loud in their
complaints against expence objeft to the
railing of a body of troops without exprnce ?
He could not conceive upon what ground
they could do tly'& ; nor dould he fee why
the United h'tates Ihuuld c It from them a
voluntary service of this kind, in the present
time of danger. Such aconduA he thought
would be improper in every point of view.
Mr. Brent said the present was a very
important question, and as the usual hour of
adjournment was arrived, he hoped the com
mittee would rife and have leave to fit again.
Mr. Allen hoped not. . He wilheci the
quellion now to be taken.
The question on the committee's riling was
put and carried, 43 to 29. Adjourned.
Tuesday, May 15.
Mr. A. Foster presented an addrefsfrom
the town of Dover, in New Hanipfhire, ap
proving of the conduit of the Executive in
its negociation with the French Republic, and
exprelling a determination to support the
raeafnres of Government.
Mr. Bartlett presented an address to
the fame effect from Gloucester, Massachu
setts.
These addresses were referred as usual.
Mr. Josiah Parker presented certain
Resolutions of Captain Magnien's Company
of Grenadiers, at Portsmouth, Virg. (a copy
of which was published in this paper on the
16th inll.) expreflive of their opinion of Go
vernment measures, and of the present filia
tion of tilings betwixtthis countryand France.
011 Mr. Parker's moving to refer ihefe
resolutions to the Committee of the whole on
the State of the Union,
Mr. Sitgreaves said, if he had heard
these resolutions rightly, they contain a libel
on the Government, which ought not to be
referred.
Mr. J. Parker hoped these resolutions
would have the usual reference, although
theremight be some expressions in them which
may appear severe upon some of the measures
of Government, as they wind up in terms
which are very patriotic and worthy ofatten
tion, viz. that if this country Ihall be invad
ed by any Nation whatever, they will turn out
in defence of it, he trulled they would have
attention paid them.
Mr. Sitc reaves said he did not mean to
go into an argument on this fubjeit, or to ques
tion the right of the people to address their
sentiments to Government, and on all padoc
cafions in which the right has appeared in
some degree quedionable he had always voted
for a reference rather than make an objeition
to it; but nothing, he believed wasmore true,
unquestionable as the right of petitioning may
be, that it ought to be exercised with decen
cy, and some regard to truth. He did not de
sire to go into an examination of the senti
ments contained in the refolutions'which had
been read, but 110 mail he thought could deny
that ihey contain a libel the mod unfounded,
and that they are exprefled in language the
mod indecent and unwarrantable ; and if the
house wished to preserve the right of an ex
preflion of public sentiment, they ought to
guard against the abnfe of it. He hoped,
therefore, they would not be referred.
Mr.. Thatcher said, these resolutions
contained a serious charge against some per
son or persons not named. If such person or
persons has or have committed crimes against
the Nation, he or they ought to be punished ;
but it would not be right to give countenance
to charges which might be applied to inno
sent persons.
Mr. J. Parker was extremely ferry that
any fhould be made to the refer
ence of these proceedings. He did not think
the language was stronger or more indecent
than that of some other addresses which had i
been received by the houfc. The triofl seVere
part of it was against the British Government.
He had, on a former occasion, heard the gen
tleman last up speak very improperly ot the
President of the Executive Directory of
France, and he did not know why these peo
ple (hould not take a like liberty with the
British Government, if they thought proper,
though he acknowledged it was not right to
give way to harsh expressions against any Go
vernment. He saw nothing in these proceed
ings 4vhich rendered them unfit to be examin
ed. I f the sentiments were not foundedâand
he believed some of them were not âofcourfe
they would have no weight j but as they con- j
eluded with faying they should at all times be
ready to defend the. country, he thought they I
ought not to be treated with disrespect. He
knaw the fubicribers, and knew them to be
worthy and patriotic characters, and good
officers.
Mr. Brooks could not agree with the gen
tleman from Virginia, that because the latter
part of these proceedings were patriotic, that
it ought to give currency to theother. If so,
it would be impoflible for any person to write
a libel. The gentleman from Virginia fays be
is acquainted with the fubferibers, and that
they are good officers. If so, they ought to
have known how to couch their sentiments in
a refpeitful manner. It was a little extraor
dinary that people (hould take this m'ode of
traducing persons high in office. Every man
muftknow who was meant. It wasevident no
other person could be meant than the Presi
dent of the United States. If they think he
has abused his trust in the way insinuated, why
do they not come forward and impeach him f
He could scarcely believe that such illiberal
and scandalous abuse could proceed from any
other than vifcious dispositions.
Mr. Brent said, that all the gentlemen
who have opposed the â¢reference of this re
monstrance have said, that the fubferibers, if
; they thought the President of the United
> States had ailed improperly, ought to have
; come forward and impeached liini. He had
supposed thÂ«fe gentlemen had not been so lit
tle conversant with the confiitution as not to
have known that the right of impeachment is
confined solely to this house. He had conceiv
ed that addresses of this kind were intended to
exprefsthe opinion of the people-on great and
important questions, and that objections were
not to be made to them on the ground of
form. He did not remember an instance of an
address ot thiskind being refufed a reference.
He believed, that during the present session
addresses had been received fully as excepti
onable as this ; but it happened that those
sentiments corresponded better with the opi
nions of certain gentlemen in this house, and
they were not therefore objeited to. He re
collectedthe Houfehas been frequently told in
these addresses of a French party in this coun
try who were ready to facrifice it. Yet these
were referred, but because the present procee
dings express opinions unfavourable to the
conduit of administration, they are objeited
to. If this was to be the way in which ad
dresses from the people were to be treated,
the object of them would be entirely destroy
ed, since none would be admitted which did
not flatter the conduit of a majority in this
House.
Mr. Dana asked, upon what principle ad
dresses were referred? He supposed it was
that they might be aited upon. The question
was not wheth. o the people had a right to
fend this address, but whether the house
ought to refer it. What is dated in these pro.
ceedings ? An accusation is brought forward
against persons high in authority : it dates the
late dilpatch-is from France as having bfen
improperly held up to view as the ait of the
French Direitory; meaning no doubt, to cen
sure the conduit of the IJjrrfident for having
feiit them to the Senate for ha
ving published them. And could this house
make charges of thiskind, abafis upon which
to found any resolution ? Certainly not. If
was not because these persons have exprefled
an opinion that public measures have been
wrong, that their address is objedted to j but
because it contains chargesof criminality.
Mr. Brooks called for theYeasand Nays,
which were agieed to be taken.
Mr. Macon hoped these proceedings
would be referred. This was the tirft instance
he believed that opposition had been made to
a reference of this kind- In the cafe of the
British treaty, addresses had been receiv.-d 011
both fides the question couched in very drong
terms indeed, but which nevertheless had al
ways been referred. At a time like the pre
sent, when all (particularly those gentlemen
who oppofethe reference of this address) be
lieve this country is in great danger, he should
suppose it would be imprudent to reject an
address from persons who are well attachedto
the Government, and wbo express a determi
nation to defend it in every time of danger,
merely on the ground of etiquette j for he
was persuaded, the fubferibers neither intend
ed to offend this house nor the government.
The part of the country in which these per.
sons reside, is also apart inVhich their service
may be required. Ourconftitutionguarantees
the right of the people to address their senti
ments to Government, without defining the
manner in which they shall do it; and though
this address might not be exprefled in very
refpeitfitl terms, it may nevertheless con
tain some truths worthy of consideration j and
if it were not referred, the addressers would
undoubtedly fay that the House were afraid
of investigation.
Mr. Gallatin said, it appeared to him
that gentlemen who opposed the reference of
these proceedings, do it upon the ground that
a reference of a petition or address implies an
approbation of it's sentiments; for his part, he
always looked upon a reference as a mere mat
ter of form. It was true, that if a petition was
worded in what was called indecent language
(about which indeed there might be foine
difference of opinion) it might be good ground
of objeilion ; but the indecency mud arise
from the language itfelf, and not from any
sentiments which it contains. He owned the
language of this address was drong, and some
of its alfertions perhaps unfounded, yet he
did not fee that it was written in such a style
as to warrant a refufal to refer it. But it was
said, that it would be improper to refer this
paper, because it contains nothing upon which
the house could act. Supposing this to be
the true criterion by which to judge the pro
priety of a reference, which he did not allow,
throe fourths of the matter in this address is
such as might be ailed upon. It reprobates
navies and military eftablilhments, and ap
probates the doitrine of the militia being tne
true defence of the country, and concludes
with faying whatever may be their private
opinions as to the pad meaf ires of govern
ment, whenever an invasion or infurreition
(hall take place, they will be amongst the fird
to defend their country. Indeed if petitions
were objeited to on account of the manner in
which they were drawn, it would be necessa
ry to fend out a form of petition to the people
when upoa any great quedion their opinion
was wanted. Mr. G. thought it would be
much the bed course to refer all these ad
dresses, without a dilcuffion the only effeit of
which was to give them more consequence
than thfey otlierwife would have! and anne
celTarily to obltruft public bufineft.
But he would remark, that this was not the
firft time that addreiles had been objected to
by gentlentenT because the Centime 11 ts which
they contained are disagreeable to them. Two
instances of this kind had occurred during the
present feflion. One of these was a petition
against the arming of merchants veliels, from
Cambridge in Massachusetts, the reference of
which was only carried by two votes ; the
other was a petition which he himfelf pYeient
ed from forty-Tout gentlemen, members of
the Pennsylvania legislature, which was ob
jected to, merely because the petitioners Hat
ed that they were members of that legislature.
The difcullion was interrupted by a melfage,
and he did not think it necelfary to trouble
the house again with the business, and the ad
dress yet lay upon the table, without being
referred. But yesterday an address was pre
feuted by his colleague from the judge?, grand
jury and fherifF, of the county of Bucks, con
taining different sentiments, which was coni
mitt ed without objeftion, though it was lia
ble to the objeiStion urged againit the address
[which lie presented, as it came f rom indivi
| duals (fating their official characters, at the
time they were doing an ait which did not
I pertain to their office. He was himfelfin si
! vour of the reference, because he did not
think it objectionable that ptrfotts fliould de
scribe themselves in this way. But it clearly
proved that the cbjeft of many gentlemen on
this floorwas toencourage complimentary ad
drefles, and to discourage petitions containing
different sentiments. 4
If he had been a member of this company,
Mr. G. said, he would not havÂ» drawn the
address in the way in which it appears. If he
had thought the opinions correit, his own
idea, of propriety wolild have told him it was
not right to have thus exprelTed them. As to
the matter itfelf, he believed the molt objec
tionable part is a mere matter of opinion.
They fay that the propolitions made to our
cominifTione:s in Paris, were made by persons
unauthorized ; and that authority has been
given to what appears extremely doubtful
and problematical. So far they may be mis
taken, but they have aright to express their
opinion. In the next place they mention
that they view with concern the attempts
making by men high in authority to widen
the breach between the United States and the
French republic, by imputing to the French
government the criminality of thof'e unautho
rized agents. He did not believe that this
could be denied. The thing was true. He
did not allude to the President of the United
States, because he did not recollect that he
had ever gWen such an opinion ; but gentle
men on this floor have repeatedly spoken of
the overtures made by those agents as coming
from the French government. Another ob
jectionable exprellion is, that " they view the
man, or let of men, as inimical to the rights
of 1 the people, and the found principles of
their felf-government, who shall, by any falfe
colouring, attempt to give the.ltamp of au
thenticity to . what is doubtful." Though
they had a right to hold their opinion, yet he
would agree that they had formed it without
ftifficieiit proof, and ought not therefore to
have exprefled it.
But there are opinions as injurious to some
gentlemen of this house as this is to others,
yet no oppolition has ever been made to their
reference. The people had a right to form
what opinion they pleated of gentlemen en
both fides the houfe>andan exprellion of ihefe
opinion's certainly could not be a good ground
of objedlion against committing them. He
recolfecte'cf that two years ago, there came a
petition from acounty in Virginia, which went
to cast a direct censure on a vote of the house
with refpec't to the right which was then de
termined ot'appropriating, or refuting to ap
propriateior thecarrying into effect any trea
ty ; it .was i(i fact a libel upon the vote of the
house, as it (aid the measure was done with a
view of encroaching upon the powers of the
Executive, yet it was referred without objec
tion ; which was a clear proof that a commit,
merit nevery; in the opinion of the house, im
plied an approbation of the petition referred.
Mr. G. recapitulated his reasons forwifh
ing the address to be referred. He did not
think error (supposing the fubferibers are
n in their opinions) could be corrected
by fotceâconvince these inen they are in the
wrong j but truth is to be enforced by argu
ment and not by a mere excrcife of'power,
such as to refufe to commit or to throw under
the table the petition, as such a measure could
have no tendency but to inflame the minds of
the petitioners, and to ri-vet them (till more in
what might be supposed to be their erroneous
opinions.

In the House of Representatives of the U
nited States, yesterday, the resolution laid
L upop the table on Monday by Mr. Harper,
propoling a lufpenfion of all commercial in
terconrfe between this country and the French
. Republic, was referred to the Committee for
e the Proteftion of Commerce and the Defence
of the country, with direiStions to report by
, bill or otherwise, without debate or division.
I The farther consideration of the bill for a
mending the Poll-office and Post road law, w s
j postponed till next feflion. The house then refol-
J ved itfelf into a ommnte. of the whole on the bill
providing for the afieffment and collection of Di
rect Taxes, which occupied the remainder of the
fitting. The only debate of any consequence which
t took place on this bill was, on a motion of Mr.
Galiatjn to ftrikeont the 13th feflion of the bill
which goes to a claflification of houfÂ«s upon which
it is proposed to lay a tax which will produce
1,300,003 dollars out of the two millions proposed
to be raised. The question upon this motion was hot
taken before the committee rose. They have leave
1 to fit again
: Mr. Datton (the Speakci) having recovered
from his indisposition attended his duty in the House
j ycftei day as usual,

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
Ma. riNKa,
AN article in your paper of the t4th inft. ex
tracted from the Bolion Ccntinel, mentions that
the Frcneh Directory ar. prepaid, in cafe of our
rejecting their propositions, to take vigorous mca
furti*gainft us. What measures, in the name of
God, do they mean ? Have they not alrsady prac
titei measures the most vigorous that their malice
or avarice could fugged ? After several years of
the most villainous aggreffinns on our trade, ther
have at length, to compleat the. climax of their
â¢ wickedn.fs, resolved to destroy it altogether. .No
â¢ vessel, whatever may be het> cargo, can now pas,
their (hip. without beiag captured and carried in
for adjudication, and we all know that not one in
a hundred of them are ever released. Here is the
utmost that these perfidious feoundrels can attain
to ; when our commerce is deftr.yed, we are be
yond their reach ; what then do they mean by
threatening us with more vigorous measures i Do
they intend to visit our territory ? God gront they
may, that â all W( . wi(h . We lrc d
match all the vigorthey can fend. Let their fa
cnlegious carcases once land upon <mr coast, and
I doubt not but we shall hurl conrufion amoneft
T"' h a L. mu . ch "fe as they themselves have
iubdued the effeminate sons of Italy. Have they
so soon forgotten the spirit of this country in our
late war, as to expeCt to find Italian troops to cope
w ' t , '' f? reall y consider us in this contemp
tible light, I pray Heaven to speed their arrival,
that we may convince the.n of their error.
I confefs that all theextenfiverobbeties of France
upon our property, have not vexed me mdfe than
the Ofm.on, that prevail amongst them, so deroga
tory to our honor, as a people of morality and
courage. In the firfl place, they have openly pro
posed to bri. c Â®ur minilters, as a rcwerd for the
hriiÂ»Â» which ibrjr, minijltrt inert to procure them ; and
when they find us averse to proliituting our inde
pendence so grossly, they, f.rfooth, threaten to
punilh our stubbornness, and take by force what
they could not gain by corruption I
As a citizen of America, my blood boils at such
inl.lence. I have indeed never served in war, nor
tryed my firmnes in any eminent danger, but
when 1 read the unparalleled rale.l ty, and brutal
tcorn, with which they treat this humble country,
my bosom Hants for the Itation of a folditr. The
indignation which such conduCl is calculated to in
spire, must surely make heroes of ns, or we have
ceased to be men.
Upon the ocean, France has done us immense
injury, and done it whh impunity, but there let
their ravages ceaf., (or in spite of their hoaftings
they will (ind the * vigor" of that country, or of -
any other, inadequate to the reduction of the ci
tizens of America upon their own foil, and the
orces that may attempt it, instead of plunder,
'hall find their graves All we aik of the magna
nimout republic, is to give us a chance to defend
ourfclves. Instead of that, theii attacks have
been entirely at sea, where they know we have no
navy to operate. Yes, they know we have no foot
hold upon the waters, and I trust they will know
with equal certainty, that tbe element which ori
ginated, (hall bound their iuryâ
" J'ifi there, ti' impetuous bomicij.s Jhall Jland, '

ever conquered, unless it was by the means of par- '
ty spirit. From this evil we are now, thank Hra- 1
vn, pretty free. Ihe eyes of our citizens are at

RefpeÃed Sir, 1
WE the fubfetibers being a joint com i
mittee on the part of refpeflable meetings
of the inhabitants of the towns of Sunbury 1
and Northumberland, and the vicinities '
thereof, in the commonwealth of Pennfyl- *
vania, holden for the purpose of expressing 1
their sentiments of the measures pursued by j
our government, with refpeft to France, c
and to declare to you their unanimoHS de
termination to support all the conltituted r
authorities of the United States ; beg leave '
to observe, that although among the last to E
addref3 you at this important aera of ourna- 1
tional independence, yet not the leall af
feftionate. Uniufluenced and almost unac
quainted with the common forms used on 1
occasions of this kind, we (liall speak the
language of our hearts, in. the stile of a"!'
free people to their firft magistrate, and as
sure you, that it is with admiration and h
pleasure we have beheld your conduit since J
called to the important office you now fill,
evidencing the strongest attachment to the Â£
* interest of your fellow citizen*, by rrsK g
with a, firmnefs and dignity, becoming tlie
__ father of freemen, the intrigues of an. art
fill and perfidious nation, tending as we
conceive, not only, to involve us in war, but
to the deftruition of that government
j whose salutary regulations we experience as
daily biddings.
We cannot but lamcit as men, and as
citizens, that a nation, once the friend and
- ally of America, on.ee her supporter in the
d hour of danger should be so changed and
, fallen ; at a time when (he declared to the
- world that her objed was to cftabliih a free
h government, (he had our warmest wilhes
forfuccefs ; but we view her now as a na
tion whose predominant passion is pokier,
trampling on all those principles which as
. fimuiate man to his maker boldly attempt
s ing to colonize the world and render every
j part of it fublervient to her views ! We fee
_ er ln 33 a Mount ./Â£tna, calling from
c her, principles which have a tendency to
, consume religion, virtue and liberty. Her
. treatment to this country, we conceive is
i unparalleled in the history of civilized na
. I'ons, Hie has wantonly committed depre
[ dationsonour commerce, and almost de
t ftroyed our trade, without cause, and with
: out provocation ; her complaints of the
treaty, made between Great Britain and
. ,his country, we consider as the wicked
pretence for plunder and piracy.
When we refleft on the wisdom, mildness,
. and prudence which have marked every step
taken by yon, as the head of our govern
ment, to effeft an amicable adjustment of
all differences, and to obtain a recompeucc
or the injuries our fellow citizens have sus
tained, our hearts glow with love and afftc
tion for you, while they burn with indigna
tion at the treatment received from the
French govemmen âlt is with pleasure
that we assure you that the pnblieation of
your in(lruÂ£tioHs to our envoys and their
dilpatches have been attended with the hip
pieft effefts ; all the refpe&able yeomanry
of our country are now united in th- sup
port of our government and its measures.
We tender our services and purses to our
government to support it in any system of
defence, it may think proper to adopt.
We are attached to peace, but it is the
peace of free men, and we fhuddcr at the
idea of facrificing our independence for the
peimiffion of any nation on earth, to re
ftiain in quietude on our farms.
Our fincereft wilhes for your health, and
happiness, attend you ; and we pray the
great, disposer of human events to continue
to bless and endow you with wisdom and
fortitude to govern us, in this hour of dif
ficulty.
