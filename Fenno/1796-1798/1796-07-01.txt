T: t. a m j:
t. It will be publilhed itt. tw& large volumes, duodecimo*
U. Price to Stlbfttibers, two doilarsj handsomely bound,
to be paid ufl delivery of the work,
HI. As feea aÂ»a number bf Subfcrll>?rs appear, fufÃÂ»
cient to defray the expence, if shall be put to prtfs.
iV. The names of the SubfcHbers (hall be prefixed.
The follow ilia; Character of this Work
it ettraiftcd ftom the" Monthly Review, p. 311, 31a, sos
March, 1793.
" We have rid fniatl degree of pleasure in announcing
thd present work to ouf readers ; as one whi.th from tba
freedom of its enquiry, the gtaridetir of its vie WÂ», and the
fortitude of its principle*, is eminently defetving of atten
tion. By this culoglum, we would by no means be under
stood to fubferibe to all the principles which these volumes
contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived at that degree of
Certainty which is requisite, for any two men to think a
like on all fuhje<fts; neither has language attained
firtent accuracy, which can enable them to convey their
thoughts, even when they do thinkalike, in a mannerper
-1 fe&ly corredt and intelligible to both. These difficulties
are only to be overcome by a patient, incessant, and bene
volent inveftigatien.
" Many of the opinions which this Work contains, are
bold', some of them are novel; and some doubtless are er
roneous :âbut that Which ought to endear it even to those
whose principles it may offend, is the strength of argu
ment adduced in it to proife, that peace and order most ef
fectually promote thehappinefs after which political re
formers are parting ; âthat as the prbgrefs of knowledge
is gradual, political reform ought not to be precipitate ; â
and that convulsiVe violence is dangerous not only to indi
viduals (for that rcfult comparatively would be of smalt
account) but to the general cause of truth. It ii the op
posite of this principle that infpirti the enemies.of politic
al enquiry with so much terror 5 it is the Tuppofition that
change must inevitably be attended by the turbslence and
injustice of commotion; and that innovation cannot be
made without the intervention df evils more deftru&ivc
than thole which ate intended to be reformed. Under the
cor.vidion of this philanthropic fentlment, of calm and
gradual reform, (which in its proper place he has fully il- 1
luftratfcd) Mr. Godwin proceeds withont scruple firft to en
quire into present evil, through its effc&tial branches, and
next to demonflrate future good.
'' Dividing his work into eight books, and making I-he
IMPORTANCE Of POLITICAL INSTITCTIONS the fubjeA of
the firft, he begins by an attempt to prove th/ omnipo
tence of government ovet the moral habits of mankind ;
and that on these moral habits their wisdom, virtue and
felicity depend/'

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE tmi'ED STATES.
Mr. Fenno,
The power of pardoning is veiled In the Gover
nor of Pennsylvania in the fame ample and extensive
manner, 2s in England, it is exercised by the king
of Great-Britain. The ninth fe&ion of the Con
stitution, on the powers of the Executive Magi
llrate, enabks the Governor "to remit fines and
forfeituies, and grant reprieves and pardons, ex
cept in cases of impeachment." The latter part
of this clause has indeed introduced a difference,
where an impeachment takes place by the popular
branch of government ; for, it has been generally
supposed in England, though a pardon cannot be
pleaded in bar or hindrance of an impeachment, tha
the king may pardon the fcntcnce. In Pennsylva
nia, by the express litter of the conllitution, the
law isotherwife. -But with refpeÂ£t to Courts of juf
tics, the Englilh prerogative has not lodged great
er powers in the king, on the fubjeft of pardoning
crimes, and remitting fines and forfeitures, than the
constitution has lodged in the Governor of -Penn
sylvania. - u
If we are warranted in this position ; and any
doubts (hould arise touching the power of the Go
vernor, to dispense with the penalty in any inftanee ;
an appeal to the law would be highly proper for a
solution of the question. Let it be supposed, for
example, wc were desirous oi deciding the point
"in what cases the Governor may release or discharge
a recognizance" ; I apprehend we (hall find, both
onptiticiple and authority, that it may be legally
done, hi all cases, except where it is taken at the
request, and upon the complaint of the party
The reftriflion on prerogative mentioned by Brax
tonâ" non pofterit Rex Gratiam facere cum In
juria et Damno aliorum ; quod antem alienum eft,
dare non poteft per fuam Gratiam"âis eonfonant
to the foyndeft principles of reason and jultiec. But
the difficulty lies id discerning the true extent and
application of the remark.
It is admitted as a general rule, that where an
inlerefl is vefled in the party, as in the cafe of bring
ing a popular or qui tarn action, the Executive can
not release the penalty, or pardon the defendant;
because, quod alienum eft, dare non poteft per fu
am gratiam. Upon a limilar ground, it is under
stood, a penalty once actually veiled, by Conviction,
in the party grieved, cannot be discharged. But,
it is not so easy to point out the degree, or kind of
interejly which thus limits the exercise of theexecu<
tive authority. We (hall however attempt to draw
the line, and examine the question, both on princi
ple and authority.
The great diftindlion on the fubjeft appears to
be thisâWhere surety for the peace is taken by a
magistrate ex officio, 01 is ordered by a Court, as
pari of the sentence, the recognizances in thefecafes,
may be discharged even before forfeitures. But
where a recognizance is taken at the requett and
upon the complaint of the party, it is otherwjfe.
It|iÂ» acknowieged on all hands, that any recogniz
ance may be released after it is broken, and the debt
thereby SOTotmeVy reflcJ In tUs cuhiiu'uiiwedHli.â ~
In wliich cafe we may observe, the prosecutor is as
deeply interefled in the business as he' was before the
Forfeiture, in as much as compelling -the wrong
doerto makefatisfaÂ£lion by the aflual payment of
the forfeiture to the public, is the only means of
affording him that prote&ion, which hefeeks by an
appeal to the laws of his country.
If a recognizance be taken npon the complaint of
tie party, it is certain, in this cafe, that before the
condition broken, the executive cannot discharge
ft ; because the party has an inter'efl in itâhis per
fonalfafety depends, upon it, 'But if the offender
Ihould forfeit his recognizance by an aflual ajfault
upon the prosecutor, the debt may then be released,
tho' it is evident, the profecufcr has become more
deeply interefled in the butlnefs than he was before the
breach of the condition. The true reason there
fore why a release will not discharge a recogniz
ance, is not the prosecutor'Â« having an interefl in the
event, but his being a party to the eriginal tranfac
lion, and that the debt in thefirjl injlance was creat
ed at his requell, and for his sole use and perfonnl
fafety ; for, the moment a forfeiture is incurred, the
nature of the <lebt is changedâ-it becomes wholly
veiled in the public, and the executive may dispose
of it, as hethinks proper, however interefled the pro
secutor may be in the payment of the penalty,
j In all cases where a recognizance is taken pith
' out the complaint of the party, it is a debt created
without hi* aft or interference 5 and in such cafe, he
: can no more be said to have an interefl in it, than
I where a fine is imposed by the court without his con
| fenrt, which there is no doubt the executive may re
mit. Before bringing a qui tarn a&ion, the viola
tion of the law may be pardonedâit is the aSual
commencement of the suit that veils an interell in the
informer, which cannot be released. Upon the
fame principle there must be the a 9 of the party
applying for surety, to veil a similar interell in him.
It is worthy of remark here, that the books which
treat on this fubjeft, uniformly mention the cases
of the informer and the recognizance together, ta
illustrate the position, "that the king cannot dis
charge an interell veiled in the fubjeftwhich
fumiQies a pretty Itrong prefumptian, that it is the
aft of the party that veils the interefl in both casesâ
in the one by bringing the suitâin the other,by ma
king the complaint.
It is true, it is laid (sown in the "books, in gene
ral terms, " that the king cannot pardon a recog
nizance for the peace before it is forfeited." But
thi;) (hould be undcrllood of recognizances, taken
in the usual and general course of business ; which
â everybody knows, is on the complaint of a particu
lar person to keep the peace towards him. And
tho'it be the prafticein such cafe, to insert in the
recognizance, 44 and towards all other â¢persons,"
j yet it is by no means a neceflary part of the recog
nizance. Sir Edward Coke seems to insinuate a
diltinftion, where the recognizance is to keep the
pease towards another by name ; and observes that
in such cafe, the king cannot discharge it before the
peace is broken. As recognizances to keep the
peace, are generally taken on the complaint of an in
dividual for the explicit purpose of protesting him
ly name in the t (cognizance; we cannot aroid think
ing the fhou! ! be nn aa corrobora
ting the idea now eimtenSed tor.
If.the executive hath power to pardon the foun
dation, it '..ems reasonable to aQert, tiiat he can
pardon every thing depending thereon, or proceed
ing from it. When fin ely for keeping the peace is
deemed by she court necessary for the preservation
of good order, it must be confidcrjed rss the effect,
or consequence of the criminal conduct of the par
ty; and therefore within the reach of the pardon
ing power, equally with the crime, of which he a
conviifted.
To fay the executive can pardon one part of the
sentence only, is a dodlrine pirifeftly novel, and is a
limitation on the pardoning power, not to be found
in the books, unless in some special cases, particu
larly on acts of parliamentâand the doÂ£hine, in
theprefent in [lance might lead to very ferioue con
sequences.
It is a fact as notorious, as it is melancholy,that
the most usual objects ps the criminal jurifdi&ion
of courts, ara the poor and friendlels, who have
generally made themselves so by their vices. To
require persons of this description to give surety to
keep Hhe peace, is to require impossibilities. ilf
courts therefore were to adopt the practice of or
dering criminals convidt, to procure bail for their
good behaviour and keeping the peace, the pardon
ing power might be extremely impaired, as the mis
erable wretches would (till be .kept in cultody for
want of sureties.
With refpeii to releasing a recognizance taken
by a magiilrate ex officio, or that has been ordered
by a court as pan of the sentence, the legcil ejfeirl of
such discharge, agreeably to the principles hete da
ted, must be, to prevent an arrest and demand of
sureties for the fame cause ; just as a pardon -will
-operate it: other cases. And as the courts do not
require surety from offenders,without good reasons,
which -commonly occur in the course of the trial,
the prudence of the executive will naturally suggest
the propriety, of not rashly releasing recognizances
for the prefeivation of the peace and order of so
ciety, even in those cases, where he may think pro
per to pardon the rejl sf the sentence.
In support of the preceding observations, we
(hall refer to two authorities ; the one extracted
from an abridgment, <o which more weight is due,
than to any other compilation of the like natute â
the other, from the very oracle of the law.
" After a recognizance is forfeited, the king
may pardon the forfeiture ; but he cannot release
the condition before it is broken ; becanfe the party
at zvhofe complaint it mas taken., has an interest in
the condition."*
The statute Weflmr, 2. chap. io. was made to
prevent trefpsflcs in parks and fifh pondsâand in
cafe of recovery in an adtion founded upon the sta
tute, the trefpafler is not only to pay heavy dama
ges, but to fuffer three years imprisonmentâand at
the expiration of the imprisonment, is to make ran
som to the king, to find sureties that he will not af
terwards committbe like offence, and for want of such
sureties, he is to abjure the realm.
Even in a civil a&ion, founded upon this statute,
the king may not only remit the fnie, but by par
don, discharge the defeadant, Trtffn that part of the
~jti&gmenr,T3\iX requires him to givefureties, or to ab
jnre the-realm.f
