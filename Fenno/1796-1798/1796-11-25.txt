To the Â£/effort of the Prrjtilent of the United Stales
Ih theantient limited monarchic*, tht whole mass
of the UTinoblc.! people, were gathered as upon an
'' American cicdioti day to co optrate in legislation
with the-hereditary orders. The demarcations of
power among the three branches were laofr, imper
,, fe& and mcorreft. The awful and iVportant judi
ciary powers were nftl fixed. In America the prin
ciples are much better known, the practice is far
superior and the effects coricfporidinjfly happy and
favorable. The judiciary power, under the j[ene
tjl government, is mure completely separated and
,6 iiidependent thun in any frtrmer inllance, much
more so than in Englandâan incalculable bltfiLig-.
â¢ c For truly and moji emphatically may it be laid, that
(â¢' the jadiciiiy (imer, under a free written con flit u
tion.is the Jhcet anchor o( the political veilel. The.
hereditary tourt of appeals blended with the leg if
fat ive pawer and including the impediments to jus
tice towards those, who ate not rich, from thcim
menfe expence, and to all suitors, from delay, as
tflablilhed in the hotife of lords, it far indeed from
, 3 iatisfatloryâand tht tenure of the very. Important
6 llation of the lord high chancellor, at the pleasure
4 ps the crown, is a far more dangerous departurr
from the divi/ion and balance of political powers
than is to be found in the American conftilutian.
But are the sober and itfietled objtclion# to the
o hereditary powers of kings and nobles rrfoivable
7 into a " mechanical" horror again (I names, having
0 no teafonble foundation ? Are they more extra
Â° vigajit, paflionate feeling into which mankind have
worfcea themfelvti up ? Are the objeilions to or

ten J to divide the people I'rors the government.
This I observe lias been hinted by an individual in
France.
*. Jf Mr. Adet's inftrufliotis from the directory are
fÂ» $s set forth in his note, the recent change that has
in taken place in the mind of that body mud be ow
â¢n i'ig to some plan and advice originating with, or at

r " This man, without the fame pafiionate talents, has
improved upon the plan laid down by Genet. As
l- In the revolution, Great-Britain would not have
11 perfitted in the war but for a party among outfelves,
'd so it is in the present cafe ;at the fame time it mud

Jâ If the Americans will fulFcr themfdves to he me

lc Â» of the world as a free people. Although falfhood 1

s in anfwerto thiÂ« will be fufficient. It mini be ac- ,
knowledged by every sober ancj unprejudiced mind, ;
e that the people of France as such, had no more to [

% America, than the people of China. It was done t
1- by the king, and his ministers, without the advice, '
e and believe 1 migh: fay without the knowledge of
the people ; and what was the ? To htimhle (
f the pride and weaken the power of a nation, that r
was considered a natural enemy. It is also well
e known that the French court delayed the ratifica
e tion of the treaty until aftei (hey heard of the re- J
1 duftion of Burgoyne's army ; and belove the French
r troops arrived in America,there was every profpetft J
f that the iJTue of the war \v9nld be favourable. Tht t

( The late unwarrantable usurpation of power by
the executive of this commonwealth, has created a
r considerable degree of alarm among those citizens,
who regard theii legislature as the proper fourc(M>f
authoiity j who regard their laws as sacred, and t<
who wish to fee the executive, without favor or par- c
tialiiy, inipjicitly fubjeft to the letter of the law. 8
I'he limitation contained iu the law for the eleÂ«- y
P tjon of rieftors of a President and Vice-President c
IÂ°f tJntted States, is as explicit as words can
concur in making it. It was to be expected that a- d
j. governor of Pennsylvania might be able to afcer- it
tain, when twelve days after a fixed time would ex- ii
pire, without asking the opinion of ihe judiciary : â¡
It wÂ«,Â» to be fnppofe-1 thn the judiciary would jTSe- ~ri
fore they gave the opinion required, examine the ft
1 law, which was within their reach, and not fuffer it n
to he said of them, that a defignmg secretary had p
f deceived them, in offering them the law deprived of n
its limitation.
But those whj supposed that the laws of Pean- si
fylvania were a sacred thing ; that they were equal- t:
: ly binding on the private citizen and the executive 5 si
have been most cruelly deceived : they have fee* n
their executive incapable of counti g twelve, refer p
the calculation to the judiciary in a molt mutilated p
fin e, and to crown the whvle they have fcen their tl
. judiciary, without examining the law, pass judge
meet on the mutiiated exUid thereof, so piefenled k
to them for ptifpofes at present unknown. <j
The law for regulating the ekftian of elea o rs, Ii

1 oni<ets who (hall tranfmlt the returns of the fame ri

TO BE SOLD,
A LEASE for years, from the 2 $tb Mareb next, in that
capital and beautiful FARM* called
PROS PE G T-H ILL, [
Situated within one quarter of t niife from the Brandy wine
s Mills, and halt a mile from the borough of Wilmington. |
, ""THE dwelling house is, built of done, two stories high,
1 genteely fimfhed, and contains four handsome rooms on
I a floor, besides an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
, cellars It is generally thougkt to command the most Â»- *
greeable profpeft of the Delaware, from the fouice of that
rivet to the Capes. This profped ia greatly etnbcllilhed by,
a full view of a va(l body of meadow, through which the*
Christiana and Brandy wine creeks are ieen winding in beau
i titul meanders. Near the house are a Kitchen, a spacious
(lone liable and hayloft, a barn, a carriage house, rnilk
houfe, &c. and a well of as pure water as any on the conti- I
ncnt. The garden contains an acre and quarter al land, â¢- f
bounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, of t
the very best kind, brought from Maryland, and in full bear- a
ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a young, â
orchard beginipg to bear, and teveral old trees that produce ,
abundantly, be fid ts cherry and other ornamental treejJ ill ;
! great numbers. The farm consists of near sixty acres of land, r
of gbod quality, and clear of incumbrances, except taxes;
I twenty of which are now in excellent clover and timothy, ,
, and ten more will be ready for lowing r.exl spring. A re- !
fidence ot uearly 8 years has convinced the fubferiber that
the situation is remarkably healthy. The great post road c
[ from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within feveoty 1
J yards of the house. In a word, the beauties and eonveni- c
ence of this situation cannot be enumerated in au advertise- c
ment, and when examiued. will probably command the at
tention of any person who isdefirous of living at one of the
most elegant country feats on the continent. The purehefer

33 years of age ; about 5 feet Bor 9 inches high; well

' rrufon to believe that he went to Baltimore, from whence
; he is said to have gone to some part of the Sufqu,ehannah,
probably with a view of gttting to Pennsylvania. A
; reward of Thirty Dollars will be given to the person who
. may take him and so secure him in fomei jail that I may
. get him again, if taken in this state, and Fifty dollars if
1 taken out of the state, an dif brought home or fecu red in
