CONGRESS. a
a
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. w
d
Monday, April 16.
(Concluded from Saturday's Gazette. J a
Mr. Nicholas was not particular as to
the manner in which the limitation was in- a
provided the exiftenceof this corps u
was subject to a limit. He did not himfelf e
believe there was any occasion for the scruples n
which had been mentioned with respect to' t ]
France, since it was well known tliat all the f]
measures which were now taken were to pro- n
vide against the possible ilTue of a war with ]j
that countiy. He did not believe it could f (
be said they were about to declare war, be- f;
cause they were about raising a regiment of ] Â£
artillery. He wished the law to be limited, i;
because he did not desire to put if in the pow- w
er of the President to continue this - ft
ger than was necefTary. He should also wish j.
to give the President power to dilchafge the a
men sooner ttittn the time mentioned, if he ] (
should think it prudent to do so. He did not e
mean to fay that a clause of this kind wasab- v
folutely necefTary ; for though it had bsen de- w
nied by some gentlemen that the legislature
have a right to difhand a part of the army, by g
withholding the appropriation, he was of a r ,
different opinion. But he saw no reaf'on why e
they should tie their hands on this fubjeit, ti
and give the power to the other branches of si
the government tÂ» keep these men in force
contrary to the wishes of that House. If it 0
were necessary that they should be continued d
in force after the expiration of the limitation, 0
there can be no douj>t, but there will be a t
disposition in to rÂ«'cna6tthe lavr. (
Mr. J. WnVaiAMS' said, it was true that a h
bill had palled that House appropriating e
250,000 dollars to be expended on fortificati- i,
ons ; but that b.ll is not become a law, and t
therefore could not be ailed upon. He was a
against making this regiment a permanent e
corps, because he thought three battalions
too many. The whole number of officers r
and men will be which, in time of t
peace, would be too large an efrablifhment, c
and far beyond what would be a due propor- li
tion to our infantry. If there hid been only p
two battalions, he should haveageed to their v
being permanent. He should no: objeÂ£t to a a
clause giving the President the pswer of dif- v
charging the men whenever he flail be of o- 0
pinion the circumstances of the country no : t
longer require them to be kept on foot. ' I
Mr. Gallatin Said, when he proposed o
his amendment, he stated, that he had an in- t
tention of introducing another, giving the r
President the power to disband the men at an t
earlier period, if he lhould think it proper, c
The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. S. t
Smitli) thinking this corps proper as a part of n
Our permanent establishment, andthe gentle- j
man from New Jersey though
V Britifli ' Â£
and Spanish polls, might be expected to op- t
pose this proposition. But it would be re- \
collected, that when the law passed fixing the f
military establishment, Congrels knew of the 1
two treaties by which tlieffc posts Wtre lurren- 1
dered. :
Withrefpeft to the form of the amendment, 1 1
he believed, at a time when all ourofficialre- ; i
ports were founded on the ground of our ex- { 1
tiling disputes with France, the present pro- ! ;
poiition could not add any degree of irritation j <
to their proceedings. It did not fay that we ! (
vtould go to war; but merely that the event | 1
was possible. He had however, no objection i <
to a modification of his proposition. He ftiould â  1
be fati jfisd to fay, "as soon as the differences ,
between the United States and foreign nations
/hall be But as we have no dif- 1
ffrences with any other nation betides the ,
French, he Could fee no objeftiÂ«n to uting the
fame words which were uled in the la)* to ,
which he had referred, and also ipt'ie law for ]
building the frigates which w<K to cease when :
ever we should be A the Meui- <
terranean powers. , ,
Mr. PinckneV beJieved_ the gentleman ,
from Pennfylva"ia hot advert to one, ma -
terial c ircup"tÂ»Â»ce of -difterence betweeÂ« our
present /ituation, and those 111 which we wete
w itl> refpett to the- Indiana' and the Medi
terranean powers. We were at war with
the Indians; and though no declaration ot
war had been made against us by the A!ge
rines, they were making war upon us. I here
fore no delicacy of expreflion was there ne
cessary ; but, in the present cafe, he believed
it was best to avoid all expressions which
might admit of an unfavourable interpreta
tion. But since this question had been agita
ted,he was opinionthis regiment ought tomake
apart of our permanent corps ; and when we
(hall return to a peace establishment, a de
duction might be made from our infantry. He
believed our militia (especially if organized
upon the plan which had been proposed)
would be equal to every purpose of defence ;
but this would not be the cafe with refpeft
to our artillery and engineers. A degree of
education and study was necefTary in that
corps which was not required in any other.
Mr. Nicholas submitted to gentlemen,if
such an alteration was proper to be made in
1 our military eftablifhmem, whether this was
1 a proper time to make it. When immediate
' I danger calls for an increase of force, he did
I I not think it a proper time to talk of increas
ing our permanent peace establishment. Be
' fides, in order to secure the dilbanding of a
part of our infantry, in the way suggested by
the gentleman from S. Carolina, he should
1' wish to preserve the power of the House over
3 this corps. He thought whatever additional
force vfas now raised should be made com
mensurate only with the occaftoil whioh calls
for the i-icreafe, without taking into view an
increase of our (landing army in fiitufte. He
hoped some limitation wouldbe given to the
' law, and he wished the gentleman from
Pennsylvania would withdraw his amend-
II rneut, and fuffcr to be introduced a limitation
c clause instead of if, which would not be lia
y ble to the objections which had been urged
~ against his amendment.
* Mr. Gallatln wished the gentleman
last up would ipecify the limitation which he
meant to propose.
l " Mr. Nicholas replied that he meant to
limit the law to one year, and from thence to
' C the end of the next feflion of Congress ; after
d which it might be continued, if Congress tho't
o proper. . .
J Mr. Gallatin agreed to accept this a-
O rnendmentas a fubftituie for his.
* Mr. Shepard was in favour of making
this regiment a pÂ«ir't of our permanent fyttem,
as itwould (erve as'a fort of military school, r
and greatly promote a-knowledge of militaty f
tatties. In the beginning of I.lit there {
was a greater failure for want of mÂ£n of this \
description than any other. I f vkiv part of the a
army were to be reduc*il,. he niould be in fa- t
vour of reducing the iji&jUTy, i&fher thfcn thÂ« I
artillery. v t
Mr. Hartley was a little surprized that an t
amendment of this kind should be so strongly a
urged by gentlemen who inlift upon the pow- t
er cf controlling the military establishment by t
means of appropriation. He himfelf believed
the house this power, and thertfbre t
thought gentlemen very unreasonable in thus t
pushing llfis amendment. The present effob- a
liflimenf had always been conlidered as very |
scanty ; as originally palfed, it was so much t
fl>, that the Prelident put his veto upon the 1
law. He w*s not an Udvocate forlarge eftab-' f
liftimÂ«nts ; but he wilhed to leave the power e
with the President of keeping these men in r
service for five years, if he Hull fee proper. {
It was true, that by way of accommodation, v
aclaufeofthe kind mentioned by his col- <
league had been introduced into the law for I
establishing a naval armament, which had been a
very emfjarralling. He hoped no limitation ' t
would be agreed to in this cafe^
Mr. Macon said, this question did not f
go to fettle the question whether or not this 1
regiment should form a part of the permanent 1
establishment j because at the expiration of ]
the limitation, Congress would again have the i
fubjefl in their power. 1 >
Mr. Gallatin. In refpeft to the ideas I
of Tome gentlimen that it would be better to i
discharge a-p4rt of our infantry, and increase (
our artillery; for our permanent establishment, i
this certainly was not "the proper time to set- t
tie that queltion. It was. when the t
law fixing the prefen; eltab!i)i>qSent was palT- '
ed ; and if gentlemen wereaerfrous of review- t
ing that eflablifhment, he should not object
to it; but the present question was to provide i
an additional force and not to fettle that 1
eftabliftiment.
In relation to the powers of the house with
refpert to appropriations, it was well know,
that whenever that question came up, it oc- '
cafioned much debate ; tut if the law was
limited in its duration, the question ot the
propriety of continuing the men in service
would return at the expiration of the term,
and if could then be best determined. He
was not willing toleaveit wholly inthe power
of the President to keep these men, or to dis
band them. Hovy did he know, that the
President might not be of opinion with the
gentlemen ffom Maryland and S, Carolina,
that they ought to form a part of our perma
nent corps. As the power of railing and main
taining armies is placed in Congress by the
constitution, he wilhed to keep it there, and,
therefore, when they raised a temporary ar
my, they had a right, and they ought to limit,
itS , conlequencu Having arisen ! i
the reftritting tlaufe in the law provi
ding a naval armament, he did not believe
that any had taken place. The only elftdi
which it had produced was, that, instead of
fix frigates, we have only three, and those
most in favour of a naval armament, he be
lieved, would be glad that wÂ» have no more ;
as it is now seen that these velfels are not tha
best calculated for protecting obr commerce ;
for no one now proposes to build three other
frigates, but ji hill had been received from the
Senate proposing the building sixteen vellels
of a less size. The Secretary of War had, in
deed, proposed some thips of the line, but no
! new frigates. Upon the whole, lie could fee
I objection to the amendment, except it arofo
' from a desire of making this regiment, a parr
of the permanent eftablifhmcn'.
Mr. Harper was perfeitlydifpofed to fuyÂ»
that he did make this regiment apart
of the V erm Â®" enl eftattifliment; but he was
not <o wedded to that idea, as not to accept
of it upon the limited plan. He wished to
fee a military spirit in this country ; to have
a 'military school, and a corps conllantly
existing ill which officers may always be found
fit tb damirt&tid troop?. He wished that if we
should at any time hercÂ«fter be overtaken
with diffitulties, as we now ate, that we might
not be without officers, as well as without
troop", to defend our country. It was-with
this vie w that he wished to fee this regiment a
part of bur establishment. For, said he, can
weexpefi to look forward to times of perma
nent peace? Can we eipeCt to be exempt
from the lot of all.other nations! Our pre
sent circuttiftances ought to admonish us to
the contrary. We may expedt, in Common
with other nations', times of difficulty, and
! times of exertion, and we ought to be provi
ded to mett them when they (hall arrive. It
was wife for all nations to cherish the means
of defence, which cannot be raised in a mo
ment. If an army, oc revenue were wanted,
they could at any time be raised; but good
officers and military science could not be
created without much previous application ;
by practice and a courle of study : these are
the most valuable set of men which a nation
can pofTefs, except it be wile legislators. It
contribuies, fifid he, greatly to the fafety of a
country, when it is known that such a ciafs of
menexifts to any conderable degree. He did
not think the objeft would be completely at
tained by this establishment, but it would in
crease our means of accomplishing it. He
should, therefore, be opposed to the amend
ment.
Mr. R. Williams was in favour of the
amendment. He had attended to the arguments
of gentlettten opposed to it, and found they
were generally grounded on the propriety of
â  keeping this regiment as a part of the per ma
-1 nent establishment, as it would be necessary
for the purpose of teaching dif'ciplipe and the
: arts of war. He was as wilting as any mem
i ber of the'eomrhittee to have an inftitiltion of
: this kind ; but not to effeft it in this indireit
! way. He did not think it necefTary to have a
i military school to consist of 15 or 1600 men.
If this law parted, he should conceive himfelf
1 bound to make appropriations for. the pay
ment of the men for the whole period lor
1 which they were enlisted, as he thought the
men would have a just claim upon govern
-1 ment for that period.
; Mr. Dayton observed, â¢hat if the amend
ment prevailed, on the doctrine which the
3 gentleman last up had advanced, he must (till
a conceive himfelf to be bound to pay the men
T forfivc years, though the law instituting the
t corps should be palled only tor two. In this
cafe, the men would have been engaged and
. received a bounty to serve for five years, yet
a clause of duration is fixed to the law; and
g for himfelf, he believed, that notwitljftand
ing the limitation inserted in the law, the
\\ r QLOME XIII.
men having engaged to serve the United StatiS
lor five years, would be bound by that er -
gagetrient, and tlicre will'be no \tay of pre
venting it, except by a pretty high handed
ait, and an appropriation was refilled to pa/
them. So that at the end of tvVo years, the
law Mil cease, and though the greater part of
these men may be wanted to complete
the regfinent now in exigence, though she/
areyet bound to serve the United Slates for
thrtee years to come, they could not be trauf
ferred into the other Corps.
If gentlemen were determined at anytime
to reduce the eflablifhment, without a limi
tation of this kind, they could withhold ail
appropriation, orpaft an aft for difbandingj a
part of it; but surely gentlemen did not with
this house to potlefs all power on this subject.,
Upon the ground of the gentleman frohi i'enn
fylvania, the present corps of artillerists and
ergineers are fufficiÂ«nt for a peace eltablifli
ment; if so, why put it out of thÂ« power of
government to keep them perfect f He was
willing to give to the President the power of
dilbandiiig this additional regiment, when he
shall believe the fafety of the country will
admit of it; but he was unwilling to reftriÂ£t
the law in the way proposed.
Mr. Livingston hoped the gentleman
from NeW-Jersey would permit him to remind
him Of a part of the bill which he Teemed to
have overlooked, when he dated the men as
polltively engaged for fi,ve years. The words
in the bill to which he afluded are, u'niefs foo+
tier di/cbarged. I'or his own part, he was not
fully convinced, that this regiment was not
neceflaryto be made a part of Our permanent
eftabHfhment ) his opiaion was 'Father inclin
ing that way ; but he was extremely furry, qii
this occjfion, to find a quelhcm railed on which
there is xjUu-ki}tLer& a contrariety of opinion,
and which requires more deliberate cOnliclera
tion than they were now difpol'ed to give it.
Whilst the house were employed in providing
measures against the dangers which threaten
us, fttch aqueftion is not only unnecessary, but
it tends to deffroy that unanimity, and the ap
pearance of it, which it Is i'o heceflary to ex
hibit to the world on this occasion. But it
was said, this regiment was to be a Sthool of
Military Difciphne for future times. If this
was intended, he did not think the term of
five years lufficiently long; and whenever
leisure and the circumstances of the country
will admit of it, he should be ready to go as
far into an establishment of this kind, as any
other gentleman ; but at present, he did not
wish to lose fight of the immediate business
before them, vile, the defence of the country.
If the amendment was agreed to, it went on
ly to put future legislatures in the fame litua
tion in which they themselves flood, of deter
mining what was proper to be done ; and hi
was against tying up the hands
atures; he w.fhed theg^ >iVgs po(rdled .
Cventlemen iayMhattnis eTjablilhmentmight be
reduced by withholding the appropriation ;
though he believed this, yet he looked upon
it as a violent remedy which never ought to
be resorted to but in extreme cases.
Mr. R. Williams thought this was oqe
ofthofe qtteftions which might have been le
gislated upon, merely upon the ground of ex
pedien<;y. As to what the gentleman from
New-Jersey had said about his (Mr. W'S) not
obtaining his objeft, if the amendment were
agreed to, he was mirtaken ; and he believed
men were seldom taken in when they aited
with their open. If the amendment was a
dopted, men could not then. fiiy, they were
engaged to serve for five years, 35 the lan
guage of the law would then be, " vve en
gage you for five years, if we wanLjww fo
iong ; if not, you willbe- J - u: T terT iÂ£ e 5 sooner."
Mr. S. m." < 11âgfHeved all the ptirpofes
uifcicti .gentlemen wished to effeft migha be
obtained by the bill as it now ftauds, as it was
in the power of Congress to disband any part
of the army when they please j they could
newly organize the lyftem, and reduce it,
when they thought proper ; but, as he had
before stated, he believed this regiment would
always be proper, he wished, therefore, to
put it upon such a footing, as to induce
proper characters to accept of employment in
it, which if it were to have only a two years
exiflence, could not be done. It was not an
easy matter, he said, to get gentlemen to go
into a corps intended to defend our forts and
harbours. He was delifous, therefore, of
putting the business on a pemialltent footing.
We have been, said he, tonltantly afraid of
having 100 large an eftablilliincnr, and this
fear has produced the most expensive means
of raising forces when wanted. If gentlemen
would consent to the establishment of an effi
cient militia system, a less military force
woftld be necefTary ; but they will not do tf*s,
they are always in favour of temporary mea
sures. He wished, on the contrary, to pof
fel's a permanent defence, without depending
upon the enthusiasm of the moment for it,
when it is neceflary.
Mr. Josiah Parkep. thought the amend
ment of little consequence. Whatever they
might now do, wo jld have no effect in giving
permanency to our Military elfabliflmieitt ;
btcaufe, according to the Constitution, that
could have no longer a duration than two
years.
Mr. Gordon could not vote for the a -
mendment, because he thought it involved
in it a flrong absurdity, and would produce
consequences which had not been avowed.
He believed, that the legal conftrudtion of
the act would be, if the amendment were a
, greed to, that the whole regiment would be
discharged at the end of two years. For the
President would receive all the power which
he had on this subject, from this law, and
the law would not warr.nt an engagement for
Wpger than two years.
Mr. Otis said, if thh amendment prevail
ed, it would hive a mischievous effect not
only upon the corps intended to be raised,
1 but upon those already in being, as it might
be supposed that the officers in the present
* corps, would be candidates for a higher grad.
â¢ in the new corps ; but if the new corps were
r only to be a temporary body, they would not
: be induced to leave a permanency to enterir
- to a temporary corps, and the regiment would
therefore be filled with young officers, v. Hp
would be placed over the heads of rxperien
; ced men in the present corps. In this cafe,
1 the old officers would resign difgulted, and we
i fliould have inexperienced officers in the
Â» whole corps. It was important, therefore,
s that both corps (hould be pljced upon the
i fame footing.
t Mr. Varnum observed, that his colleague
J had supposed that the officers in the present
- corps would be candidates for offices in the
e newcurp*; but that they would be unwillingto make the exchange, if they were liable to
be difcliargedat the end of two years; yet he
afterwards slated, that if young men were ap
pointed over them, they would resign.
There appeared to be an inconsistency in this,
because if they were v<ry desirous of holding
their situations, such acircumftance would not
make them resign ; and if they were ijot so
desirous of holding their situations, they
would not be prevented from accepting of
offices in the new corps from the chance ot
their being disbanded at the end of two years.
If he were of opinion, that this new regiment
was neceflary to be made a part of our peace
establishment, he should alio be opposed to
the amendment; but he did not. He knew
it had been the wiflyof some gentlemen to
keep up skeletons of regiments, in order to
have officers ; but he did not think it would
be very advantagous to the United States to
retain officers in this way. He could not fee
what military knowledge officers were to ac- <
quire by being in pay, except they were in
a situation of acquiring knowledge from ex
perience. He could not conceive either that
any gentleman would content to the discharge
of any part of oiy infantry, 011 account of this
additional tegunent of artillery ; but such an
idea might aitift them in carrying their point.
He could not f-.e why gent+enien should dis
trust the condiidt of this house two years hence;
anu if they were not d'ftruitqfl, no evil could
arise fro;-, 'he present amendment. No act
could be parted without the concurrence of all
the branches ps government, and he,thought
no act oughf to be continued in force contra
ry to that concurrence.
Mr. Nicholas said every gentleman who
had opposed this amendment, had acknow
ledged that it would place the law upon a dif
ferent footing from that upon which it would
stand without it. As to the want of security
in the situation of officers, he could tell the
gentleman from Malfachufetts how he might
increase that security. It might be done by
telling them they should never be difchufged ;
but he trusted, when gentlemen law that this
opportunity was leized for doing what could
not be done at a time w hen no danger threat
ened us, they would be jealous of their right
over military ellablifhments. With refpedt
to the difficulty fnggeftad by the gentleman
from New-Jerfeyv he would fay that* when i
there was a difmclrnation to do a thing, any
apology, howtverweak, might be refarted to.
The men would certainly be engage l for five
years, and if the United States had occasion
for them, would be obliged to serve"tor that
time, either in the new corps, or in the corps
now in exiftcnce: And when gentlemen fay
this regiment is neceflary for a peace eftablidi
luent, he would aik them whether they could
wish that we had had the expence of them for
years part F Ue believed they could not re
gret thefiiving of this expence.
Mr. T. Claiborne thought the bill,
without the amendment, would be an,oblique
violation of the constitution ; at leafl the ar
guments which had been used ir support of it,
were of this kind For though the constituti
on fays that no appropriation (hail be made
for a military edab'ifhment for more than two
years, yet tins bill was to lay Congress under
an obligation of engaging men for five years.
As lie could fee no reason for doubting that
-.future legislatures would adt rightly, he should

of Artillery apd Engineers was.read the third j
time, when
Mr. M'Doweli moved to haveitrecom- j
nutted. He did not wilh to vote against the i
bill; but if it paired in its present form, both |
he and many others would do so, from an idea j
that this regiment was intended to form a part
of our permanent establishment. He also'
thought the number of men proposed to be
raised was greater than was neceflary for Oc
cupying our fortifications. - He hoped, there
fore, the bill would be recommitted, in order
to undergo some revifian.
The motien was negatived, there being on- I

and flakes therein mentioned j vihen the blank,
for containing the sum of money to be appro
priated being filled with 3050 dollar*, the
committee rofe,and the bill was ordered to be
engrofled for a third reading to-morrow.
Mr. W. C. Claiborne called for the or
der of the day 011 the report of the Secretary
of War on the petition of Captain Stephen
Cantrill; but on Mr. Sewa ll's exprefling a
desire to go into x committee of the whole on
the state of the Union, he gave way, and the
House accordingly tefolved itfelf into a com
mittee of the whole on the (late of the Union.
The committee being formed,
Mr. Sewail called up the bill to enable
the President to procure cannon, arms and
; ammunition ; which having been read, he
! moved to filP the blank left tor the sum to be
! appropriated for the purchase of cannon,
1 ammunition and military stores,
with dollars, which he dated was
agreeable to the estimate of the Secretary of
I War.
Mr. Otis thought this an enormous sum.
He wished the Chairman of the committee to
explain the items of which it wascompoled.
Mr. Sew all owned the appropriation ap-
I peared a large one, but 600,000 dollars of it
1 were for 50,000 stand of arms, calculated at
12 dollars each, which he believed would be
Jas low a price as they could be got for. If
| imported, they would cod less ; but if manu
factured here more. The Secretary of War
j also recommends the purchase of 1300 cannon.
1 He did not know that the whole of these
would ba immediately neceflary, but they
would be wanted in the course of a year, or a
| year and a half. The ammunition and milita
ry flore., in which were included powder,
ball, tents, See. wereeflimatedat 200,000 dol
â  lars, which he believed would not be too
much.
J.Williams thought the sum far
! v ery7arge~quan'fitu;s of arms an J cannon",''!
1 the arsenals of the United States, and though
j it btf admitted that the fortifications and vet
: fels will require a great number of cannon,
yet 1300 would be far too many. He should
, be willing to appropriate a fufficient sum, but
j not more. He knew the Secretary of War
had made a calculation to a very efrtenfive
i amount; but he wished to make his own cal
culations. He had done so, and was of opi
nion that 600,000 dollars would be as large a
sum as would be expended before Congress
met again. From having been on a commit
tee on the fubjeft of arms heretofdre, he
knew Tomething of their amount. The mili
tia to the eafttÂ»ard was generally well armed,
though to the fottthward this was not the cafe.
If 20,000 stand of arms could be got, he tho't
they would be fufficient; and he believed
they might be purchased for a much less sum
than haa been mentioned. Some of tjie bri
gade which he commanded had purchased of
a very good quality at nine dollars a ftahd,
and where they were got he believed more
might be had.
Mr. Otis said, if a small part of this sum
could be saved till next feflion, it would be
well. Every 100,000 dollars which could
now be saved was of consequence. Twelye
dollars appeared to him a great price for a
musket. He could not think so many can
non as had,.been named would be wanted.
Instead of 1, dollars, he hoped a milli- !
on would be agreed to. He could not think
that more would be wanted before the next
meeting of Congress. "
Mr. Sewail said, "a fraud of arms was not
to be estimated by the price of a musket. Se
veral other articles were included. He wasin
formed by the Secretary of War that they
could not be manufadhired here for less than
14 or 15 dollars, though they could be im
ported for less, but the importation would be
attended with uncertainty. There would be
no necedity, Mr. S. said, tor retaining the
whole sum proposed to be appropriated in the
Treasury, and whatever price the arms was
estimated at it would not be given, except it
were neceflary. He wished the appropriation
ta be liberal; as it was neceflary the country
should be prpvided with arms, whatever
might be the expence.
Mr. Harper did not wish to treat lightly
the arguments ofgentlemen who conceive
that the prefept situation of affairs does not
require so large an appropriation as is propo
sed for the purchase of arms and ammunition;
but he could not concur with them in opinion.
Gentlemen speak of cannon and arms, but
fay nothing ot military stores. Arms and can
nen, it is well known, are of no use without
these ; and so procure -tjiem will require con
siderable time and arrangements. They mud
be either created at home or purchased from
abroad, and the latter would always be pre
â ttrrions. WhÃVr.fpetHo thequantity ofcan
non, he coufd not fay that 1300 would be ne
ceflary ; nor would he fay they would not be
neceflary. Would gentlemen recoiled* what
1300 cannon were on a coast of 2000 miles in
extent, and for all the military operations for
which thpy might be wanted ; and not only on
the coast and for military operations, but al
so in the vessels proposed to be conftrudled or
purchased for the pro of our trade and
commerce. With refpetl to the number of
small arms, how could any one fay w hat num
ber would be wanted ? Was it not one of the
nioft deplorable circumstances attending our
present situation, that we are destitute of
armsf And ought they not to provide.against
future exigencies, as well as the present I In
v?in would it be for us to raise revenue or
troops, without arms, and if they were wait
ed for till the time ofufing them was arrived,
the price of obtaining them at present would
fcc as a drop in the bucket, compared with
the conlequences Vefulting from a want of
j them. The expÂ»ncc ought, therefore, to be
I met without liefitatidrt. . . !
Gentleiiwi) had.spoke of arpntng the W.llt.a
j which alone, he fuppojed, confided of eight
| hundred thousand mÂ«t( ; or if a select corps
1 was agreed to, they woiild consist of 130,000.
i And of what use would the organizing of our (
mWitiabe,if arms were not put in their hands > 1
Could any man fay we Ihould not have oc
casion to call ost 50 or 60,000 militia men.
It would be wanton so fay so, at a time when
we are threatened with enemies from without
and within ; when we .may be assailed from
the weft, from the foutli and from the east.
| When all these circumstances are taken into
view, he trafted the coniinittee would not aft
upon a short-sighted policy, but make ample
provilion, which not be done, he was '
persuaded, by appropriating a less sum than \
had been proposed. j
Mr. M'Dowfli. could not agree 111 opi- ;
nion with the gentleman lalt up. He had at
tended to tly Itatementniade by the,chairman
of the select committee; but he could not ;
believe it was neceflary to appropriate to so ,
large an amount as he had propoled, tho' he 1
wished to appropriate amply. -Gentlemen â¢
whoaÂ£t under the imprellion that war is una- j
voidable, will consequently with lor greater
preparations, thofe who think different- |
fy. The gentleman just fat down was fori
providing for all polfible cases, from without !
or within. He thought 1300 cannon necelfa- ;
i ry, as amongst other things, they would be j
wanted for the additional vefFels contemplat
, ed to be built or purehafed. He believed lie
made this calculation rather too early. He j
hoped that measure would jiot be gone into. ;
: When gentlemen supposed every pollible (not
protfable) evil to happen to us, they might
incur enormous expences which were unne
ceflary. For his own part, he did not think
r we had much to apprehend from any enemy,
1 either from without or within ; t>ut 'f we
i were attacked, he had 110 fears as to the e
-1 vent. He hoped, however, they should not
: lavish away money unnecelfarily, as he was
fenrtble heavy taxes mtift be resorted to in
support of these expences. Speaking of can
non and fnrall arms, gentlemen did not take
: into view what we have at prelent oil hand.
1 It wa? well known we have have many of
; both, and that our mi(itjÂ«i gajcrally arm
; ed. He hoped, therefort, a fmi'li Ttirti would
, be agreed to-
Mr. Sewa ll discovered that he had made
s a mistake in the adding of the diflere-nt items
f together. Making the deduction on this ac
count, and taking off something from the
number of the cannon which had been men
-3 tioned, he believed a million of dollars would
be fuflficient. He therefore proposed to fill
. the blank witli that sum.
t Mr. S. Smith said, if men were always
t to calculate the expence of a war, before it
e was gone into he believed wars would fel
f dom occur. He was of opinion that the
. quantity of tannon which had been named
r was not too gieat. The veflels proposed to
1. be built, or pjrehafed, will require betwixt 3
e and 400 cannm, the fortifications would also
y require agrest many, and it would be necef
a lary to have ; stock on hand, to replace such
. as might be tiken or destroyed. 50,000 stand
r, of small armi, in addition to what we have,
. could not be too many. Yet it may not be
0 necessary to provide for all these at this time
He did not beleve that the Secretary of War
ir could poflibh expend a million of dollars be
lt- fore the ift <*f January next, and no more
" n &e(i nnw hr appropriated than could be ex
h penuetr Deroie inSt mnr. - -w-â el i
800,000 dolWs would be full as much as
1, could be expended before that time, and if a
d million was negatived, he should move that
it sum.
ir Mr. Gordon was of opinion with thegen
e tleman from Maryland, that a less sum than
. a million of dollars would be a fufficient ap~
. propriation for the present. Hethmight 1000
a cannon and 30,000 stand of arms would be a
s very ample provision. If an invasion should
- should take place during the recess of .Con
e grefs, they would, of course be again imme
. d:aiely called together, and before that time
[, the mohey how appropriated could not be ex
pended. If what he had mentioned should
t be thought fufficient, tljey, with the 200,000
1 dollars for ammunition, &c. wonlAamount
n to 890,000 dollars. He should, therefore, be.
. in favour of 900,00.0 dollars.
f Mr. Shepard was for doing every thing
, necessary ; but it appeared to him that they
e were about tÂ» appropriate for a greater num
ber of cannon aÂ» j small arms, than ever could
n be necessary. Ht. thought 1000 cannon and
e 20,000 stand of fufficient. He
i should, therefore, be in of the 800,000
e dollars. They ought, he said. to consider a
a little how the mopey was to be gcÂ», before so
. large an appropriation was made. HebsJj eV
. Ed the arms he had mentioned, in additior.-to
. what we have,,wo'i}ld enable us to fight any
enemy thatcould ever come against us."
t Mr. Macon wished the bill had been dif
ferently drawn, and a separate appropriation
t had been made for each of the items menti
oned. He should have wished also to have
known the number of fortifications, and the
1 number f>f cannon they would require, as it
) would be useless to have fortifications with
out cannon. He believed it would be well
(as the gentleman last up had suggested) to
look at the expence of this business as they
proceeded. It had been said on a formerday,
firft take every measure necessary, and then
1 provide forthe expence ; but he was glad to
: find that gentlemen had now changed their
1 opinions, and begun to look at the expence.
He should be for reducing the number of can
non, and increasing that offniall arms.
Mr. Rutledge said, no gentleman was
' more sensible of the perilous situation of the
: country than he ; buthe thought this million
rather an exceftive calculation. The number
of cannon not only appeared to him large, but
the size seemed also extraordinarily large. He
observed the estimate contained 100 thirty
two pounders. No vessels that we have or
are likely to have, except the frigates, could
carry cannon of this size, and they are already
provided for. He did not think our'fortifica
tions required 32 pounders.
1 He saw in this estimate an item which he
thought ought not come within their calcu
lation, which was 200,000 dollars for copper
and fheathihg, In making this estimate, the
â¢ Secretary of War had feveral'fhips of the line
: and twenty smaller vessels in view, which it
1 was probable would not be agreed to ;at lead
â¢ he should be against them. He thought what
1 was necessary ought to be done, regardless of
expence ; but he was against incurring any un
necessary expence. He thought 800,000 dol
lars would be fufficient.
Mr. Dana hoped a million ot dollars would
not be appropriated for thisobjedf. He should
not hesitate at any experice if it were neces
sary to repel immediate danger ; but because
danger threatens, they ought not to make ap
propriations which would (hew that they did
not think coolly upon the business. He did
â¢ not believe it would be of any advantage to
make a larger appropriation thin coafd be
expended within the year, because funds
mull be provided for every expence which is
goneinto; and if more than was necessary was
r appropriated in this instance, it would only
4Â»
fcrvc to cripple us in other measures, parti
i cuUVly witii rclpcd to our maritime defence ;
and as lie thought this of corifequence, lie
should wifhto lessen the prefcnt appropriation.
The Gentleman from Maryland had proposed
800,000 dollars; but he should think 700,000
would be fufficient.

To the Prejident of the United States, and
the Senate and House of Representatives in
Conrrefe n(T, mlhd :
The Refpedful ADDRESS of the Sub
: fcribers, citizens of Ncw-\Â«r!f.
I AT A TIME when a foreign power, in
support of inadmissible demands upon our
; country, declares its relianecupon divisions
among our citizens and upon the extftence
of a party favourable to its views, there ap
: pears to us a neceflity for an expression
of the public -epinion, as well to repel so
' derogatory an imputation as to manifeft to
J the government, on the part of its confli
. â  tuents, a just and adequate sense, both of
; ! their rights and of their duties.
â¢ j Under this i [rip re flic nwe now refpeft-
j fully offer a declaration of the sentiments
j by which we are a&uated on theprefent oc
casion.
In a review of the conduftof our govern
s ment lovt-ards the belligerent pal ties in the ft ill
â  subsisting war, we are happy to recognize
: fatisfa&ory evidence of upright intentions,
j and of a fiweere desire to cultivate and prr
| serve peace on the balls of justice and goods
faith. This had been in nothing more con
s fpicuous than in the measures .which, with
t so much solicitude and perseverance, have
" been pursued towards accommodation and

Princetoivn, April 21, 1
MR. FENNO,
The following address ttv the President
and both houses of Congress was agreed to ;
with a unanimity and zeal that I have never
witnessed li ce the years '75 and '76. In- |
vitations to assemble were circulated in the 1
country for a we&'x preceeding the meeting, j
When the citizens were met the importance ,
of the crisis, and the propriety of address
ing the President and Leg : flature of the U- |
nited States, were conciftly dated. They
entered into the idea with warmth, ippoint
fed a committee to prepare the addref3, and J
adjournedâwhen the committee were reariy :
to report, they re-afTcmbled. The adarefs ;
was read. It was then rfpeated paragraph
by paragraph ; and on each, a vote was
taken, which, in every inltance, appeared
to be unanimous. As each paragraph was :
read, several gentlemen present took an op
portunity to detail and enforce the ideas
contained in it. An ardor was visible in the
whole assembly that mud have given plea
fureto every veal friend to his country, and
shewed that the true tone of the American
charafter, free and independent, was be
ginning to be reflored in all its purity 3nd
energy.
The following Address was this day preferr
ed by Mr. Stockton and read in the Senate
of the United States :
A large and refpeftable meeting of citi
zens inhabitants of the townships of Wind
sor and Montgomery, and the towns of
Princeton and Kingftan in the state of
New-Jersey having a fie m bled in the church
at Princeton on Saturday the 21ft of A
pril agreeably to invitations previoufiy giv
en for the purpose, it was unanimously re
folded to prsfent tothe President, the fe
liatc and house of representatives, the fol
lowing dutiful and loyal address.
Legijlators and Rulers of America !
At an interesting crisis like the present
you will naturally be solicitous to
cerely possessed of the public sentiment,
and to know to what point you may de
pend on the cheerful and zealous
tion and aid of every citizen iji the ener
getic mcaftires which, you may find it ne
cessary t adopt for the public good. Al
though claiming an equality with you in
your private and individual capacities as
your fellow citizens, in your representative
fun&ions we venerate you as the organs,
and respeCt, in your persons, the majetly
of tKe laws. We presume not under the
form of resolutions or iriuroÂ£tions to dic
tate to those to whom we have eo' ro^
the right of judging, and whoft situation
affords them the best means of forming their
decisions with vvifdom, and an equal regard
to the general interests. We have assembled
at this important moment only to pledge to
you our loyalty and fidelity. We estimate
at its firft value the precions liberty which
ive enjoy ; and we feel with an honefl pride
thns national dignity, and that felf-refpeÂ£t
which the freed people upon earth ought to
feel. Americans haÂ»c broken the yoke of
one tyrant and they will not become the tri
butaries of another.
We have feeu with indignation the depre
dations committed on our lawfui commerce,
and the repeated iufults offered to our gov
ernment, whilst it has fought nothing but
peace on jufl andequitable terms- Wehave
seen with the difdlinful sentiments that be
come freemen the late efforts to reduce
us to the dependent and degraded state
of Milan or Genoa, or to enslave and
dismember us like the miserable re public of
Venice. We have seen with the mingled e
motions of resentment and contempt the in
solent proposals to exaft from us an eior
mous and incalculable tribute not only to
aid the national interefb of France, which,
tho' less humiliating W >uld ft ill be intpler3-
ble to a free people, but to maintain the pro
fligacy and vice of their individaal agents ;
a Condition below infamy itfelf. Legisla
tors ! Rulers L "We pledge to yon our
Â£iW, our Fortunes and our facrcd Honour:
We will cheerfully submit to every pecuniary
burden you may think it reqtufiteto
for the public good : and the militia o. New
Terfey will, as they have always done, fly at
Y<Ml r command either to rep-1 the invasion
of foreign enemies, or to crush the villaihy
of domeflic traitors. We pray for peace
whilst it can be preserved on honourable
terms ; but trusting in heaven, in our cou
rage, and in the juilice of our cause, we
cannor fear the insolent menace of any n -
tion. The calamities and the expences of
war we deprecate, but we hold no calamity
to be so great as that of dependence on a fo
reign power, and no calculate can be made
.f LLal honour except by ihofe who de
serve to bA people who can so far
forjret themselves nuift soon fubrr.it to ex
aftfiLs calculated not on their aUity to pay.
but on tke wants, the wilt, and the vices of
their tyrants.
Our confidence in the wisdom and inte- i
grity of the Executive of the United States
,has always been undiaken and entire, andwe
find it daily augmented by the developement
of events, if diviiionD have weakened the
Lcgiflatun; and tempted the avarice or am
bition of foreign powers to form from it the
most criminal expectations, we trufl that
hereafter unanimity and energy will defeat
their unwarrantable views. As tar as de
pends on us we will refute the (landers that
have reprefentcd'usa peopledividedfrom our
government ; wÂ£ wyjf disappoint those in
sidious intriguer# who are inctffantly driving
to Create a feparatiou that they 'mav have a
pretence for intermeddling in our domeflic
policy, and at length an opportunity to en
slave us, k as they have done so many other
Jlates by taking under their protedion a tur
bulent fa&ion in the name of the people/
In proportion as the sincerity and human
ity of the American people have led them
to shew a forbearance in the pursuit of peace
which has been misconstrued into pufillanimi
ty,cr a mercenary dereli&ion of the solid in
terests and the glory of their country, will
c they, when robfed lÂ»y the injuttice of their
enemies, display a noble firmnefs and enter
prizc in its defence.
Although it belongs not to us to di&aje
lt measures to the government, it is a privi
-0 | lege which we trust will not be unacceptable
, r ! to you in this trying junfture, to declare i
j our warm and unequivocal approbation of!
le J the wife and temperate system that has hi- I
r | therto been pursued with refpeft to our so- i
! c ! reign relations, and our undiminifhed confi- '
j-_ ; dence in those who preside over the affairs !
i of the nation with so much wisdom and pru-1
y ? dence. We are prepared for every event.â !
t- y ou fiiou'd deem it necessary toÂ»mpofe a ;
[( j i rellraint upon foreign commerce, we will |
y ! cheerfully forego the conveniences of living j
s 3 ; which commerce yields. If on the other |
hand you refolÂ»e to claim your rights, and \
as ; bravely to defend them, we make not indeed j
l( j . any boaftful profeflions of chaining viftory '
as ; to our arms, but we fear not to meet either j
p. j in the field or pn the ocean those who have
a 9 been accustomed to boast. That the EteÂ«-
lc nal who pre fides in secret over the fates of
a _ empires maypreferve the American people,
1( j and ever have your Excellency, and you the
m ' honorable members of the Senate, and the
e _ House of Representatives in his gracious and
|C j powerful protedfion is the fervent prayer of
your refpe&ful fellow-citizens, and the obe
dient fubje&s of the laws, the inhabitants
t . and freeholders of the. pi ecinflg of Prioce

By tfie (hip Penelope, Capt. Flagg,
which arrived yesterday in 41 days from

ot then lÂ«:en admitted to an audience by
the Direftory ; but three days before capt.
a gg Wc Bourdeaux, he was informed by '
Mr. Fenwick, our Cotrful, that he had
received a letter frorti gen. Pinckney, in j
which he mentioned that the Direftory had v
appointed the 2cth of March as the day on 1
which they were to have an audience. A c
letter containing the fame advice had been , I
received from gen. Pinckney by Mr. Hqrry ' c
who has taken h : s passage from Bourdeaux v
in the (hip Pomona, bound to Alexandria. 't
All accounts by the Panelope, as late as t
the 20th February, agree in faying, that a v
rupture between France and America de- \
pends on the measures the government of: \
the United States may take, relative to the {
conduft of France ; that if hoftilitiea take f
place, they will begin by Americans mak- c
ing reprisals, some declaration, or an alii- j
ence with the enemies of Fraace, as the j 1
French find too great advantages in the im- j 1
puriity of their present conduft, to change | ]
their system into declared hostility ; and it , t
is thought thty will not foften their con-; c
dust or offer reparation, on the contrary ]
they fay the injury and insults come from Â«
us. and tljey themselves a(k inderanifieation. j t
The greatest exertions were making in all, t
the ports of France to get ready the cxpe- (
dition against England. It appeared t*> be 1
the determination of the French government :
to facrifice every vessel thty had, rather than
the scheme ffiould fail. men were I
to go on the expedition from Brest and two i
other parts, and every vessel which could ]
carry 80 men and upwards was in a slate | 1
of requisition It was said â¢ the attempt 1
would be made in the month of May. <
By this vessel a letter was received by a c
gentleman in this city from Mr. Pinckney i
dated Feb. 7, in which he fays that they ]
were not yet received. On the 31ft ult a <
.memorial was presented hy them to the 4 Ex- 1
ecutive Direftory requeftingthat they would
fumifh them with, the reasons why they
were n6t acknowledged ; and if thty were
ot received, they would in a few days re
quest passports to leave the Republic. No
answer had been received at th: date of the
letter.

This day at 12 o'clock the Mayor, Re
corder, and Aldermen, and the Scle& '
and Common Councils of Philadelphia,
waited on the PreCdent of the United :
States, wi}h the following
ADDRESS:
Tothe President of the Uhited States.
At a moment when dangers threaten the
peace and prosperity of the Unitecf'States,
when foreign insolence and rapine have deep
ly wounded our national honor and injured
our lawful commerce; it is presumed the
Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of the city
of Philadelphia will not be unwelcomeâ
when they come forward to assure you of
their perfeA approbation of your adminiftra- t
tion, and their entire confidence in your
wisdom, integrity and patriotiim. While
we admire thÂ«- prudence and moderation with
which our government has received the un
provoked aggreflions of France, and the
sincerity and equity of your endeavors to
conciliate her friendfiiip, we feel the inde
pendent pride of Americans in your dig
nity and firmnefs. As we are fatisfied that
nothing has been wanting on your part to
preserve to us the blessings of peace and fafe
ty, we prepare to meet with fortitude the
confequencej that may follow the failure of
your exertions. Confident that our gov
ernment has been jaft and impartial in her
dealings with all nations, and grateful for
the happiness and prosperity we have enjoy
ed under it in the days of tranquility, we do
nttt hefi'ate to promise it our utmost assist
ance in the -time of difficulty and need.
Preluding over the counsels of your coun
try in a most eventful erifia ; we hope and â 
trust you will find a fikrd arid energetic fup
pctin the people of America. Permit us
to congratulate you on the profpeift of una
nimity that now presents itfelf to the hopes
of every American, and on the spirit of in
dependent patriotism that is rapidly rising
into aftive exertionâand to offer a sincere
pyayer that while you continue to serve your
country with wisdom ahd fidelity,-you may
never find her ungrateful.
Hilary Baker, Mayor.
' Francis GuÃney, President
of the SeleSt Council.

of the Common Council.
ANSWER.
7 0 the Mayor, Aldermen and, Citizens of the
City of Philadelphia.
Gentlemen,
Never, as I can recollect, were any class
of my fellow-citizens more welcome -tÂ»
on any ocnafion fritf the mayor, aldermen
and citizens of the city of Philadelphia,
upon this. K -
At a time, when all the old republics of
Europe are crumbling into dust, and o
thers forming, whose destinies are dubious ;
when the monarchies of the eld world are
some of them fallen, and others trembling
to their foundations ; when our own infant
Republic has Jcarcely had time to cement its
or decide its own practicable form ;
when these agitations of the human species
have affefted our people, and produced a
spirit of party which fcmples not to go SIF
lengths of profligacy, falfehood and malig
nity in defaming ourgovernrnjat f j-(
probation and conficU-n-cc are to'me a great
confolatiop. Under your immediate obfer
vatjon and infpeftion, the principal opera
tions of the government are direded ; and
to yon, both .chara&ers and conduit must
be intimately known.
I am but one of' the American pepple,
and my fate and fortune mu.t be decided
with theirs. As far as the forcesof nature
may remain to me, I will not be wanting in
my duties to them, nor will I harbor a suspi
cion that they will fail to afford me all ne
ceffary aid and support.
While, with the Â£reatefl pleasure, I re
ciprocate your congratulations " on the prof
peft of unanimity that now presents itfelf to
the hopes of every American, and on
that spirit of Patriotism and Independence
that is rising into a&iye exertion in oppo
sition to fedudion, domination and rapine,
I(offer a sincere prayer that the citizens of
Philadelphia may persevere in the virtuous
course and maintain the honorable
> eros their ancestors, and be protested from
' every calamity physical, moral and politi
cal.

This is perhaps of all others one of thi
inoft unfortunate reaforts that could be df-*
signed ; since h must have become a gener
Â« wish that the enemies to their country
ihould be driven out Â®f all refpeftable plac

that the creditors of these reprobates are
