City Hall, Sept. 1, 1797.
The IridfpeÂ£tors of the Health Olfice 011
uf t'le College of Phy
sicians and other gentlemen of the Faculty,
and after confutation with several of their
fellow citizens, on mature deliberation una
nimously adopted sundry refr.lutions found
ed on the laws for. regulating the Health
Office, which in their ojyimon would be
inoft likely to prevent the I'prcading of In
fection, these resolutions were fubniitted to
the Gttvernor, & at the earned solicitation of
the Infpe&ors were fandioncd by his Pro
clamation of the 23d of Aug'uft, 1797.
The inspectors flatter themselves that as
far as those resolutions hare beeu aited on
the moll salutary effects have followed, and
that had they been carried into earlier ope
ration benefits would have refujted.
To impress this belief on their fellow
citizens, and as far as possible to draw forth
their eo-operation, the infpedtors deem it
only necessary to state the manner in which
thofc resolutions have been aÂ£ted on.
No sick person has been removed unless
the attending pliyfician declared to the
health officer that their particular lituatiou
made itneceffaayâno force has been used
or ever was contemplated.
Where persons with infe&ious fevers have
been fitinted in confined places, every per
lon belonging to the house as well as those
adjoining, except the necessary attendants,
have been preffingly advised to remove.
Yellow llags have been placed at the doors
to prevent unnecessary intercourse, and in
the neighbourhood of Penn-ftrett, where
the'â  infed'on appeared molt malignant, a
fence has been ere&ed to stop the commu
nication with that part of the city.
. The city hospital, with several out build
ings, have been kept in complete order for
the reception of the sick, and a number of
tents have been pitched for the accommo
dation of families whose connection with
the sick made it necessary for them to re
move.
After this view of the fubjetft, the In
fpedtors of the Health Office hope that all
sick or indisposed persons, as well as those
employed in the eare of them will fee the
propriety of an early application to their fa
mily phyiician, DoÂ£tor Duffield, consulting
physician f. r the Port of Philadelphia, or
to the aforementioned phyfieians appointed
by the Board, that the necessary relief may
be administered, and the Infpeftorp again re
quest tljot the phyfieians generally will re
port fucb cases as may come within their
knowlsdge, that'the fta'tements of the pro
gress of the d'iforder may be publiflied to
their fellow citizens.

PHILADELPHIA, d
FRIDAY KVF.NINO, Septtmber 1.
To the Chevalier d'Trvjo, Minified Pleni- p,
pottniiary from Spain to the United States. e[
Sir,
The 10th article of yolir analysis states,
that Mr. Pickering " evidtntly contradifls
himfelf when on one hand he is p'eaftd to C
attribute to you, the movements of the In- c '
dians ; and in the very next paragraph ffiews. \
that it might proceed from American Citi
zens ; as it adtually docs according to Mr. P
Mount's letter, and that he aÂ£ted with the tf
-knowledge and intelligence of the very fame S1
Britim mmifter in whose private notes, -with- <1
out Jignature, and perhaps not in his ott m hand 0
writing, such implicit confidence is placed."
The paragraph in the report to which c
you allude fays, " Whether this plan of ex- n
citirj* the Indians to diredt hoflilities 1
the United States has been contemplated
and promoted by any of our own citizens,
it is difficult to fay ; but that one or more "
of those citizens have proposed and taken
measures to detach the southern Indians j
fr6m the interefl"s of the United States, and t
to destroy the influence of the public agents a
over thofenationsandthus to defeat the great e
objedts ot their appointment, the chief of *
which is to preserve peace, is certain."
Fromthis, Sir, you have found out "that (
Mr. Pickering (hews that the movements ,
of the Indians might have proceeded from I
American citizens. Mr. Pickering has said 1
nothing like it, and if he has faidfo, Blount's j
letter does not support him in his aflertion. (
From that letter it does not appear that any
measures were taken to excite the Indians ,
to actions of any fort. Tt is true that in* it 1
Carey ip advised to leflen the influence of 1
the public agents over the minds of the fa- 1
vages ; in order that if it (hould be resolved
to carry the fclieme into execution it uiigÂ£t
be the more readily accomplished ; and to
this Mr. Picketing undoubtedly alludes
when he fays, that ffceafures had befn taken
to detach the Indians from the uiterefts of
the United States. But surely it does not
follow because measures had been taken to
detach them from our interefls that those
measures had fucceedtd ; much less that I
their movements when hostile towards us
{hould have been the effedt of them. Blount's
motive for endeavouring to destroy the influ
ence of our officers was tp increase his own.
He knew that their efforts would oppose an
insurmountable barrier to the success of his
project, and that projYft wis direftcd a
gainst Spain, not against the United States.
Supposing therefore that he had succeeded
to the extent of his molt sanguine wishes, he
would there have flopped and never have
caused a movement among them hostile
to us.
It is impossible too, that any movement
of the Tndiaas could have proceeded from
any of the measures recommended in that
letter, because the secret was discovered be
fore Carey'could have begun his operatisns,
and the difeovery of the secret completely
defeated the plan.
You call Mr. Lifton's letters " pritate
notes." Now if official answers to official
enquiries on national concerns can be called
private notes, I really do not understand the
term. But they were " without signature."
The importance of this remark leads ycu to
place it in italics. Whether' the name of
Robert Lifton was placed at the top or the
bottom of his letter, is. well worth being
made a fubjeft of diplomatic representation ,
Would any falfehocd have beet! less infa
mous, or would any'fentiment contained in
the letter have been less binding in tba one
cafe than in the other ? Is it necessary to
accompany a communication, of this kind
with all the formal nicity which is eflential
to the validity of a legal obligation ? To
what despicable fhifts are you obliged to
resort to support the feeblenefa of your
cause.
As to the mere surmise that perhaps they were
not in the hand writing of the Britifii min
ilter, I really think it unworthy of notice.
It is a matter of which you been
wholly ignorant, and it is as reasonable to
si. ppofe that any other sommunicat ion which
has been made to our government was not
in the hand writing of the perfou making it,
' as that the communication of Mr. Lifton
was not in his hand writing.
The 1 ith and last article of your analysis
states, that " although in all Mr. Picker
ing's official communications he has always
manifeftedto you that the American govern
ment knew nothing which indicated any
foundation for your suspicions, Mr. Blount's
letter prove 6 that you were perfectly in the
right.".
I have already shewn that Air. Blount's
. letter, infteadof proving that you were per
-1 in the right, proves dirtftly the re
verse. But even admitting that all your
- suspicions were founded on truth, there is
not a tittle of evidence before the public
r that government at that time knew of
' anything whit/i juftified them. There is
' indeed the bare unsupported aflertion of Mr.
' -Bache in favour of a presumption of this
! kind ; but I know nothing in hi 3 charaÂ£ter
I or conduit which entitles his afiertions to
. implic/t He ha 3 been pereÂ»p
---"./ torily aÂ»ntradi&ed and called upon to pro
s' duce his authority. To do this he is either
> ashamed or afraid ; he is either afraid to
shew that he has drawn his information from
a source polluted by a breach of confidence,
or ashamed to (hew upon how flinft fy a foun
dation he has rtfted his positive affirmations.
This may be a " new political fin" ; he
may have Weil once more carried away by
" party palfion," and he may now hope by
" again amuQpg the public with his protefta
tlonscf patriotism and-honor, to wipe away
1 the ftignia which a deteftion of the falfehood
(hall have inflicted upon'his name.
â  Thus, Sir, I hate diferitangled myfelf
from the tedious labyrinth of your letter.
In it you have profefled a personal desire to
preserve harmony between and the in
United States. To use your. owji.terms.â tt
I have seen with pain thafcin its " laoguage fc
and tenor, it is not calculated to promote so tl
defireable an objeft to us all." The lan- is
guage of inflammatory inveftive, of petulant N
and malignant insinuation, never yet h;
produced an amicable termination of differ- d

te tion, colle&ed os the Lakes, would, this
1 summer, attack the Illinoisâhath thought
c proper, for the security and tranquility of
.f Lower Louisiana, to ftifpeud the alrea4y
is commenced evacuation of the posts of No
r, gles and Natchez. These being the only
is posts which cover the lower province, the
;r ceffiou of them would eiable the English,
o should they render themselves masters of Up
). per Louisiana, to diiturb and ravage that
>. country ; and this would be the more easily
r effected, as by an article of the treaty lately
o concluded with'Grcat-Britain,, the United
m States acknowledge that the English may
e, navigate freely, and frequent the polTj of the
1. said states, upon the rivers in general, lakes,
s. Bcc. a manifeft cmitradiÂ£liou to the treaty
ie concluded with Spain, which it fcems to
y annul, since by this last the United States
y declare that n'o nation- (hall navigate the
j. Mississippi without the consent of Spain.
y Although the legitimacy of these motives
id of fuf enfion hath been represented with
fuhable candor to the Congress of the Uni
lf ted States, and communicated by our or
r. ders to the cornmiffioner for running the
o bonr.dary line, ac well as to the ccmcwnd
ing officer of the detÃchnjeiii of American
tf'Oops now nt Natchez; yet, we are in
formed that a detachment from the army of
the United States, stationed on the Ohio, on
is now on its way through Holftein to the
Natchez, whilst thd~militia of Cumberland Â°'t
have been warned to hold themselves in rea- Ec
dinefs to march on the (hortefVnotiee. hei
These hostile arrangements which can on- co
ly relate to these provinces, since the United fe f
States are now at in peace with all the fava<re lug
nations ; the recent threats of the commif- on
fionyr tor establishing the boundary line, and hii
of the officer commanding the American de- no
tatchment at Natchez ; the profpeft, and wt
(if we may creditan American gazette) the th
commencement of a rupture between France, to
our intimate ally and the said states, all ad- m<
vise us'to be upon our guard, and ready so t0
defend our poflefliorcs with that valour, that th
energy, which the inhabitants of this conn- c "
try .have difplaytd on all occasions, with
that and superiority wliich a
knowledge of.-their local situation afford, c 0
with that confidence which integrity and th
justice inspire. If the Congress of the Uni- mi
ted States entertain no hostile designs against ca
these provinces, let them leave the posts of ra '
Natchez and Nogales, which are the only
barriers between the English and LÂ»wer
Louisiana ; or let them secure us against
that article of the British treaty which ex- no
poses even the capital of Lower Louisiana an
to be sacked and pillagedâwe will then ' ,e
evacuate the posts and lay down those arms
which they force us to afTume, by arming ( j (
their militia in a time of profound peace, i
and fending a considerable body of trbops

to his majellv, setting forth the hardlhips
they labour undir in the interruptios of ,
their commerce, from the pert of Cadiz 1
having been so long and so closely block- 1
aded, that no (hip could fail from or enter j
it. The king gave for answer, that his ad- \
miral had received his final inftruft;ons',Â» ,
which ate supposed to beâto risk an en- ]
gagement. The Spar.ifh fleet confifls of ,
30 fail of the line ; our's is only 22ânine
of which are, however, three deckers. 1
) Fr6m _ the admirable position of our fleet, ,
and the (kill and bravery of our officers and ,
5 seamen, the noble commander is under no 1
| anxiety of the result. The' whole fleet is
in the highest state of subordination, and
' has felt nothing of that feverifh spirit which
: has pervaded some other divisions of the
â  British navy.

We this day learn that the Irifli parlia

At 12 o'clock on Wednesday night,
" Mr. East,' a king's mefTenger, arrived in
J town from lord Malmefbury. Mr. East
g came passenger from Calais in a Danish
packet; he was onlv 29 hours on his jour
ney. We understand that the mail coming
r from Paris had been (lopped and the poll
boy murdered.
We learn that several conferences have
1- taken place between M. Letourneur and
e lord Malmefbury, and that each has deliver
i- ed to to the other his projet.
is At the fame time that lord Malmefbury
t dispatched a courier to England, the French
>f plenipotentiary also sent a messenger to Pa
y ris, with the propolltions made by lord
)- Malmefbury. No time has been loft- in re

Ie Eafl;, as an answer was returned to them
1, late last night, when Mr. Brooks and Mr.
>- Drcflms, king's messengers, left town for
it Lisle, to be in waiting,
y The Paris papers received contain no

NEW-YORK, Aug,,ft 30. I
General Pirrckney remained in Hulked '
on the 1 jth of July.
.On Monday night, about half pa't to
o'clock, a person of the name of William
Edward", was going through the Park,
being about the centre, a person in a dark
coloured coat came up to him, and pre
sented a piftbl to his breast, and bid him
lug out his moneyâEdwards having only
one and fix pence in his pocket, he ordered
him to l'peak very low, and said " he was
not the person he wanted." It seems there v
were three or four in a gang, and one of
them walked fluwly, watching Edwards
towards Warren street. We hope that
meafurta will be taken to bring these villains
to juttice, as this is a further proof that
there is a gang of them lurking about the
city.

Of the French privateer, so much talked

Â» A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE,
c , There is now at Newport, Rhode liland,
a French.preacher among the Friends, who
is much admired and followed. Hs was an
- officer in the French cavalry uptil converted
- to quakerifm. Hisjife and' manners are ir
* rcproachzble, fimple, and llriil
s ly cpnformable to tlig purity and spirituality
s of .the tenets of that refpe&abhf feft. This
military convert, this modern Cornelius,
>- does not attempt to dazzle his hearers by
that glow of oratory so natural to his coun
;s trymen, but speaks with all that delibera
>, tion and mildness so remarkable among, the
* Friends. but seldom, and when
c he does, he frequently pauses more than
f- half a minute between his sentences. The
Y purity of the heait, the worlhiping in the
d spirit, the futility of ceremonies, and the
joys of new 'Jerusalem, are the faultlef*
themes which fall from his deliberate tongue,
t Although he is so perfect a friend in his
n do&rines and manner of public speaking,
ft yet his drab coloured plain cloaths eannot
h conceal the genteel movementsof theFrencli
r_ man, nor hi 3 broad beaver wholly -veil that
g sagacious phyfiogtiomy, and eye of fire,
it which ever ditlinguifhes the sons of old Gaul.
The Friends esteem him a remarkable and
le very valuable convert, raised up 011 the
id great head of the church, for some good and
r _ glorious purpose, wbile some of the wicked
and uncharitable, hefmte not to whisper
-y th'eir suspicions tbat lie is an artful man,
; h who means to become the father confejfor of
a _ the whole flocks He may !â  * what he seems
r J a well meaning, conscientious man, yet it
e . cannot be deemed illiberal, if so extraordin
tr. ary >a charrftrr fliould be followed by the
m eye of suspicion, feeing he comes from a na
r. tion who hava systematized intrigue, even
or before Ignativs Loyola founded that injlueHti

WALPOLE, (N. H.) Aug. 21
INCIDENTS AT HOME.
Early yesterday morning, the inhabitants \
of this village Â»ere rouftd to oppose the fu
ry, not of the firry but of the watery ele
ment. Vail quantities of rain, having fallen
Â»he preceding night'and collected from our
mountains in torrents, too' mighty to be re
tained in the wonted channels, had burst their
bounds, and Were ruftting into different parts
of our street with deftru&ive impetuosity.
Many buildings were undermined and much
injured ; the furface and produce of several
gardens fvvtept away ; and a confidenble
quantity of other property carried off or
damnified. A fulling-mill, belonging to
Mr. Sike6 in the north part of the town, a
number of mills.and bridges in the vicinity
have, we hear, been carried a\*ay by thia
deluge. The extent we have not yet ascer
tained.
Citizen Monroe loudly demands the rea
fpns of hjs recal.' Our faithful secretary of
state offers to ivhifper them in the citizen's
ear ; but he is determined not to hear a sin
gle rcafon, unless given as Itvcily as he makes
the demand. If reasons are ever offered,
we hope they willbe fatiofaftory to the ci
tizen, as he intends, it is supposed, if they
appear inefficient, to resume his office.
The progress of fraternal institutions
augers well to civilization and to letters. A
lodge of free and accepted ipafons has lately
been confecratpd, at Amherft, in this date ;
two others, at Groton and Munfon, Mass.
with a pleasing display of elocution and sen
timental hilarity. The latter is called the
" Thomas Lodge," in honor of Isaiah
Thomas, JLfq eminently distinguished by
his attachment to the craft.
The " Phi Beta Kappa" foeiety has
given to the public the " Ruling Palfion,"
(a poem, which has extorted unbounded
applause) and hare provided an ample
past, at the next anniversary, for the literal
ry epicure.

i DEATH of BURKE.

f the immortal Orator and Statesman,âthat
" great man, whose valt and irresistible elo
-6 quence has so eminently contributed to pre
serve Great Britain from being overborne by
that immense torrent of Gothic barbarism,
which has broken down the feeble barriers
â¢ elsewhere oppoftd to it, and whelmed in e
qual desolation and dullness, the frozen gla
â¢ ciers of Savoy, and the mild, fertile clime
of the once fierce .and high fouled Iberian.
All bow beneath the blast, for " the Age
of Chivalry is gone j" and to " fall down,
rafcal-'ike, with a pinch," is become the
falhion ot these degenerate times.
'â¢ Cold is that tongue whose high-wrought
eloquence could keep alive in one little i.le
alone, a fire which it saw daily extinguish
ing in the regions around, by the mighty
hand of revolution and disorder. Nor did
he live to fee it put out. The extin&ion of
the mutiny a Ihort time btfore his death,
trniH have (hed a benignant gleam over his
d latest msments ; aud laid his aged bejd,
e content, in the lap of Death.

NEW-YORK,. August 31. t
Received by the brig Vigilant, captairi'Ca- c
bles, arrived Jiere yesterday from Fal- 1
mouth (Jamaica) June 21. '
Yesterday arrived here the American
brig Sally, captain Tarry. 29 days from <
Rhode-Island, with'a cargo or provition3, 1
lumber, and fifh, conflgned to Messrs. John 1
ChriftJe and Co.
Wednesday last arrived the brig Polly, â¢
captain M'Lean, belonging to this porf, in 1
32 days from tlie Bay of Honduras, loaded 1
with mahognyâThe Polly mourns 4 guns '
4 pounders, and her men 17 in number, in
j eluding the capt'ain and a Mr. Cross, passen
ger. Captain M'Lean diftiuguifhed himfelf
by a mod able defence of his vessel, off this
port, against a republican (loop privateer of
4 guns, and full of men, with mulqnetry and
small arms.
In , fight of the inhabitants of this town
and neighborhood, at half past four in the
afternoon, the aÂ£lion commenced. The
Polly was under a press of foil, with a frefn
breeze, fleering dire&ly for the harbour*
and the privateer within mufjeet (hot to
windward. In this position a running fight
was kept up for upwards of an hour, during
which time the privateer fired 22 guns, ex
clusive of muquitry, at the Polly ; finding
(he would not strike, the desperado put his
helm up, and made three different attempts
to board. In the last (he run her jib boom
direttly under the Polly's main boom, to
board on the quarter ; fortunately, however,
the firft man that attempted to get en the |
Polly's boom, miffed his hold, and fell over
board. â 1
This very lucky accident, and a volley
of small arms, from capt. ,M'Leans brave
crew, threw the republicans into confufion
and they bore away to pick up their man,
which brought the Polly to windward, and
a head; the (heels of the privateer flying
her topsail being (hot* away, it took some
time to pick up the man, and get the (licets
fplieed which was no sooner done, than they
made fail after the Polly, and was soon up
with her; when nearly under her stern, the
captain of the privateer brandiftied his sword,
was diftindlly heard to fay in broken English,
we have got hira, threatening instant death
to the Polly's crew, if they did not strike.
At this moment enpt. M'Leans boatswain,
John Hill, a brave fellow, got the only gun
that could be brought to bear upon the ene
my, a stern chafer, which, was a load of
caniftcr (hot, he fired that into, her decks.
This gun molt probably saved the Polly, as
several of the privateer's men were fecn to
fall, and the blood running from the deck;
the moment after the boatswain fired this
gun, he-was unfortunately killed, a grape
(hot went through his head.âCapt. M'Lean
had a very narrow escape, a ball from the
famegun that killed hisÃoatfwain,grazed his
check, and took offfor.e of the (kin. The
marauders finding they were nearly in gtin
(hot, feeing several boats with armed men
beating out of the harbour, and Fort Bal
caras tiring at them, after.very politely
wifliing capt. M'Lean a " Good Night,"
bore away, with the the tri-coloured flag
flying, and got off.
The cook of the ? ollv, a free negro,
late of the (hip York, Lainbridge, was
dangerously w.ounded in the a&ion, a ball
having paffci through his arm and kreaft.
Capt. M'Lean yot fafe in at 6 o'clock in
the evening, to the great joy of a number
of fpe&ators, whose moments of anxiety
1 during the eor.teft, cannot be described.
On Thursday morning, the remains of
the boatswain, that so gallantly fell in the
aftion, were very decently interred, attend
ed by captain M'Lean and most of the sail
ors in the harbour ; minute guns were fired
on board the Polly.
At a diftrift court held at Newport, R. I.
the firft day of August, the (hip Hope, li
, belled for reporting (laves from the co.-.ft of
| Africa to a foreign port, was condemned,
and ordered to be fold in September next.

Our cultivation has been much improved

real benefit.
Republican virtue, and close application tb

It is a passage from the travels of Nicholas
Klymus (in Latin) through FJollandâ
" It waa in the month of December, and
not far from' the feftival they call ChriftmaS.
In an early ramble on a cold frofty morning,
I chanced to take a Dutchman's farm in
my way. A hog-pen was adjacent to the
houÂ£e, a dirty, muddy, qmgmire place,
in which three of four of the swine were
ftraitly confined. The poor devils had been
so illy attended as to be half ftartftd, and
had not even a handful of straw to lie down
upon. They shivered with cold, and seemed
1 to fay to me, Traveller, compassionate on
our cafe and set us free !âI at firft faffed
1 by them with indifference, but refleftion
getting hold of me, of which I am eter
â¢ nally the dupe, I returned, and at the risque
1 of the Dutchman's vengeance, ventured to
â¢ put down a corner of the fence to let the
i poor frozen starved animals run a little at

, nor fÂ»rgive it while I exiil) one of the mi

re CAUTION.
'j* TT/HEREAS a combination of men in this 1 J
lh VV county have undertaken to enrich thÂ«m- ,
T selves.by fabricating titles to sundry valuable trad# i 1
ft of land, the property of gentlemen living in New c
York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which \
Â«â¢ traSs of hnd large sums of money have been paid f
t' to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchalers â¢ i '
Â« It is therefore just that public information Atotild a
* ke given, to the end, that the injured may feekre- '
>' dress while the men have property, and are to be
1 found. Those who have been discovered are Tru- 1
fe man Harrifon, Joftph Witcomb, said now to re- '
1- flde in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and '
several o'hen who go under fictitious namps. It is
f- supposed that the lands offered Icr sale on those fa- j
1 hricated titles, are at least woi th fifty thotiland c
1- dollars. Such as we have knowledge of are ,
Â»f as follows : Lots No. II and 11, OtfegÂ« patent, f,
thousand acres each,the a&ual property of William :
Dellwyn, i.ow of London ; lots No. 58 and 64, c
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of i'
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and lamftsAvenll I
and others, ot this State. There is some grounds d
1, to suppose that the lands of Richard Wclis and
k _ Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are utv'er their
:, management.âThe Printers will do well to give b
e this a place in their papers, as well to caution the I
â , PuMc against purchnfmg those lands, as also to de- ; Cl
e prive those men in future from imposing on indivi-
duafs, which their education and addrels have en- â¢
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a fhopketper of some note in this country.
The following affidavits will fct in a clenr point r(
of 'lewthe wickcdncfsof those men,which when tl
the public have perul'ed, wilt induce them to ex- h;
cufc the interference of Wm. COOPER.

I rhomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav- tr

- was the property of William T. Franklin now Mr.
