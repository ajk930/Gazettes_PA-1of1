Wafhinglert City, now buildiug far the perms
nent iVfidence Â«sf the gavernmeut of the XJniietl
i> Sfates, and of coude, for the metropolis of the
a . unioH, being iitÃated upon the mod healthy and
beautiful feite for a gieat city that nature ever
formed, and commanding the molt exteniive com
f> mercial connections of any place within the United
States, has, as might be expe&ed, attra&ed the
a , envy, and ill-will, every city,
:o town, and village, between the Delaware aud James
River. Hence, a variety of miffeprcfentations have
been industriously propagated, tending to impiefs
an idea, that Cfcngrefs will not go there at the
_ time fixed by law, and that consequently the project
will fail.
In order, however, to obviate these impreflions,
and to state the matter in its tritk it will be
necessary to point out, the bafts on which
this great national object (lands.
The constitution of the United States had not
been 4oug ratified, when the states of Virgisia and
Maryland, refpe&ively, psfTed laws, offering te
Congress the exclufirelegifktion of ten miles square,
and a large sum of money, tewjrds the eredtion of
- the public buildings; upon condition, that the per
manent feat of the government of the Unites States
(hould be fixed on the river Potomac.
Accordingly, on the 16th day of July 1790,
Congress, by the law fixing the permanent feat of
the government of the United States, " accepted"
of the diltrifl of territory, and of the money offered
by the states of Virginia and Maryland ; hcrncr, it
becomes a compact between the United Stale'and
â¢ those individual states; not repealaMe
but by consent of all the contracting parties.; Â£
consent not likely to be had. In confe'quence of
authority by the fame law, the President of the
United States obtained fram the original propxie- 1
tors, a grant of one-half of tie lots in the City of
Washington, as a fund for the public buildings.
A large portion of these lots, belonging to the
United States, have been fold to citizann and so
- reignei'B, the purchasers confiding'in the national
faith.
Those, therefore, who believe, that Congress
. have power to repeal that law, ami to meet in any
other place than the capitol in the City of Wash
ington, 011 the fir ft Monday in December in the
year t8Â»o, will alfu believe, that they have power
. to violate contrsfts, to refufe to pay ths principal
. and interest of the national debt, and to become
legislative swindlers. No friend, however, to this
country, will believe aÂ»y such absurdity. As to rite i
idea of Congress meeting in the President's house,
instead of the capitol, it would be a greater viola
tion ufpublic-faith, than Congress not going to the
Citv at all; as large purchases bf lots and improve
ments have been made about the capitol, in confi. '
' dence that it is to be the place of general legislation,
agreeably to the plan publiUhed.
A certain political writer, last spring, swelled up
a monthly pamphlet, in abusing the location of
Washington City ; and at the fame time, was so
grossly ignorant of that great national ebjeft, as not
to kDow in what state in the union it stands. The
whole of Washington City is in Maryland, a state,
exceeded in virtue, morality, and attachment to ol
der and good government, by no (late in the union.
It would, therefore, be well for those who under
take to censure the measures of Cbngrefs, if they
would firli inform themselves of the geotjraphv of
'the United States,
That Sufficient accommodation will be ready by '
the time appointed, and that Congress will meet in
Washington in the year 1800, aud remain there as -
long as the present government (hall continue, is
absolutely certain : the eonfequence of which will
be, that fh? immense population and wealth which
Congress, with the departments of the government,
draw aftpr {hem, will at once constitute a city ;
and the demand for lots, and buftk of building,
will exceed all calculation that can now be made ]
upon it. For, as foen as Congress shall adjourn .
fiom Philadelphia, to meet in therr ntwCity at their
next session, the anxiety throughout the United '
States will be extreme during that fumaier, to pie- (
pare hotels, taverns, boarding houses, retail flores, '

1 QUESTION. .
d What number of inhabitants is the 1 et-itory of
r the United States capable of fubfilhng, and at
1- what probable period will our population reach that
d number f
e ANSWER.
The state of population in old countries, remains
s from age to age, nearly fhtionaiy ; because every
e country is capable of fublitiing only a certain num
s ber of inhabitants proportioned to its freedom the
e gooodnefs of its foilâextentâclimate, and natural
fc advantages. 'On this basis, it is worthy the atten
tion of a curious mind to investigate, what number
, of inhabitants the present Territory Â®f the United
e States is capable of containing, and at wh t period
i it will prsbably reach a stationary point. The me
dium of the population of Ofeat-Britain, France,
t Holland, Ireland (which contain together 274,128
1 square miles) is 165 inhabitants to each square
> mile. The United States contains, exclusive of
, water, 920,313 square miles; admitting this im
t menfe territory fufeepiible of an equal population,
â¢ it will forlow that it it capable of lubfifting
> 151,851,645 inha!)itant6,
Supposing our present number of inhabitants to
, be only 3 1-2 millions, and that this number (hould
continue doubling each fucceflive 25 yeais, our
1 whole territory will be completely lhtcked with re
i publican citizens in less than 120 years.
AUGUSTA, January 26.
We hear si om Louisville, that the legislature goes
on with the utmaft harmony in their legislative
pi-oceedingsâThat a committee has been appointed
to unquire into the failure of the Indian iraaty â
one to enquire into the failure of the couirs in the
middle diftridtâanother to report as to tjje pro
priety or impropriety of opening an office for dif
pcifing of the tract of sountry lying between Flint
River and the Oconee ; an-d one to revise thejtidi
Â«iary system.
It is now reduced to a certainty that Mr. Adams
is ths President of the United Slates, and Mr.
Jsffetfon the Vice President. At the fame time we
are affared,' from a refpeftable quarter, that the
latter gentleman (contrary to the received opinian)
has declared a perfedt acquiescence in the choice of
his fellow-citizens, his view having never extended
beyond the office of Vice-President of the United
States. Each being thtis perfectly fatisfied in the
choice made by the people of the United States,
what-may we not expefi fiom their united talents
and pdtriotiftn. ,

THEATRE:
The Way ft get married, a new comedy by Morton,
has been twice performed to very general acceptance ;
and ftrems likely to become a favorite piece.
Altho' the writer cannot claim any great ftnre of 0-
riginality in all his characters, yet that of Tamrent is
certainly in a confiderjble degree novel, as w-Tlas na
tural ; and is so uucommonlv interesting, as to eo far
111 atoning for the numerous faults of the play.
Moreton never more in his .eleiuent than in this
eccentric character Mrs. Francis did Clementina j n
" such a style as added lustre to the piay, and reflect
ed the highest honor upon her judgment and talents
The excellence ot Harwoor! in To% M wett as every
character he undertakes in a Gmilar is univcrfallv
felt and acknowledged. WigneU's Dafhall was sup
ported with great spirit ; and fc-emed luppilyto hit in
every point, the conception of the author.
The character of Faulkner is a very unfortunate one
for.the writer j and mars many ps the fcer.es in which
the author has introduced him. Cooper did all for
him that could be done.
Several feenes in this play fc-em utterly useless - as
not only not tending ia atiy wife to help forward tke
plot, hut actually having no connection with or rela

with which |he play opens.

crime. If the faÂ£t be as (ta'ed (which, hoVcver,

known at th- time, it would probably have been a

alarming, than Ninety Four, when Mr Jay was dis
patched to the British Court ; and if recent advices
may be depended on, we have teafon to expefl a
happy iflue from Mr. Pinckney's Embassy to Paris.
Without preteuding te enter upon the merits of
our dispute with France, we may fairly fay, that aÂ«
we had a right to expect better treatment from her
than from England, so the irritation caused by in
julliee from her, is more fenbfibly fÂ»lt, thaa if per
pet rnted by England.
Whether the lengthy note of Citizen Adet, con
tains charges incapable of refutation, will be decid
ed by comparing it with the Secietaray ot State'*
letter to Mr. Pinckney, by thu docu

The memorial and petition of the owners of land
in the state of TenHcfTee, that was purchased from
the state of North-Carolina, and has fincc keen
yielded to the Indians for haotiÃg ground.
Shiwst*, '
That your memorialists obtained certificates to a '
confidetable amount from the state of North-Caro
lina for services and supplies they had rendered du
ring the war : that the debt of the state being
greater, as they conceive, at the end of the war,
than the debt of any other state in the Union, con
sidering the number ef its inhabi.ants, and the citi
zens nearly ruined towards the end of the war, by >
the general depredations of foreign and dotnaiic 1
enemies, the Legislature unable to discharge the in- I
tereft of the debt opened an office for the file of
land, and offered a large traÂ£l to the public credi- *
tors, reserving other lands as hunting grounds for i
the Indians. At a time when the whole taxes in >
Â» the state, the civil lift being de lusted, were not b
equal to one quarter ef the interest of its debt. v
Your memorialists may fay irith conSdence that Ito '
alternative presented itfelf W to take the lands of
ferÂ«d them or lefe the debt. To many citizens it
appeared necessary to take landu, for they had no- $
thing left them except certificate*, and they hac not t,
fortitude to abide what seemed to them inceitllale
deftruftion. After our locations had been made
and our lands surveyed, a treaty was made with the
fn'dians by the commissioners of the United States, e
by which our lands were surrendered to the lndi' I'
Â»"s for hunting ground. It might have been ex- ll
that the Legislature at their next meeting j
wtrnld have restored our certificates, in cafe they ti
improperly fold those lands ; but they conceiv- cl
ed as we suppose, that their right as explained by
their confliiution was indubitable, and they foleron
ly resolved to guarantee our titles and 10 give us , lj
pofTcffiou of the lands. We are'confident that no 0
deception was intended, bat laws and resolves of the fa
, Ante have brought us no re'ief. The General As w
fembly at their session in 1789 yielded the sole ju- v;
nfdiflion of the Western country to the United
States, with an express reservation in favour as your
memorialises, of all their rights and claims under the 61
state. From year to year we have patiently expec
ted relief ; in the year 1793 we addrefled the Ge- w
rieial AfTembly, entreating tha: fucn justice mieht | P *
be done us as had been done to other citizens. The i Pi
Assembly referred 11s to the Congress, and feflion j br
after feffioÃ has pafTcd away, but Congress has done Â£
rmthing in our favour. We have again claimed jus- p r
tice frona the state, and we are again referred to the
Congress. We hope and confide that the honelt ~
claims of citizens will not be eludfd by two legis
lative bodies, upon whom no law can operate but
the clear law ef justice. During the late wÂ»r, we
did not thrinkTrona any danger or calamity to which r
wÂ« might be exposed for the public fafety, bm we k!
cannot difcoverÂ«ny reason why we should be mark > il

every other citizens, their claims have beÂ«uVundeJ c Â°
at zof. in the pound. We are the only prrfoiis to
whom justice is refuted, we leceive nothing but una
â¼ailing premises. -
WhiU we are feekii.g for justice, we do not take Z.
the liberty to prescribe the manner in whuh it is to fy
be done. We have no direct claim to any thing, Â°'
except the lands that are furveyod and granted to J "'
our use, nor are we desirous to exchange thofejandt 77

Dear Sir,
I fhould[have written you last week, Ijad I then been
able to,afcertain certain fafls, the rumour of which I had "â¢
heard. A Mrs. BeeTs, a mar neighbour to me, the 'wife
of Eben Beers, and daughter of captain Samuel Hoggins,
of this town, had been, for fourteen weeks, exceedmgly
diftreffvd \ ththe Rheumatilm, to such a degree that for 1
fourteen weeks previous to the 29th of last month, (he
had not been able to walk across the room even with crut- 1
ches, save only once, when she made out with the assist- 3
anctxif cratches to hobble part of the way across her room.
On the 2-^tii ot September last, ihe procured* set of -/our }
metallic fuhftances, and in less than an hour after ffie had
begun to ul'c them, in the manner direcSed by you, foe'
Tufc front her chair, and walked about her house, and on â j-j
the next day Ihe went abroad to her neighbours having y c
thrown jfide her crutches. I have this day paid her a visit
in company with her lather, and Timothy Jones, Esq. or
who lives in the street where she resides and dire&ly op- tn
pofiti to her residence, and with Capt. Ahel Burrett, who
is her neighbor, and lives within eight yards of her ya
door. I requested her to relate her cafe over in their j-â
presence, which Ihe did, and these genttamen all with one tr(
voice, supported, from their own knowledge, her flory. * t
It is a duty which yoa owe, yourfelf and the world to pro- , 3
mulge this event. J am, very refpe&fully, t[l
Your obedient f*rvant,

1 TUisjnay certify, that the fubferiber, in his visits among
1 hi' people, has used Dr.Perkins's metallic points, to re- o(
Ucvo pains and inflammations of various kinds, and has
' fuccseded to his aftonilhment. They have seldom failed
' to relieve the head-ach; tÂ«eth-acb, ague in thÂ« face, iu
: fiaaimation in the eyes, cramp, cholic, rhe.matifm, pains
1 of the breast and'fide, fcil.s, scalds and burnsâSometimes '
" there has been a perse& cufe from one operation. A lad "
r who had been confined three days with hijh symptoms of
a fever, very hot and full of- pain, by an operation of the
* f oints, designed to relieve his head, his face turned pale
' and cold, his fever and pain immediately left him, and in
' a few days he was aut of doors ; the year before, at the _
fame season, he was taken with the fame fyraptoms, and j
r lay extremely sick forty days. The efficacy of the olctal
-1 lie points has gained great credit in this town.

Rev. Elhanan Winchestir.
} certify, that on the 21ft of March 796, I saw Dr. "
Perkins's method of cure by pointed metallic inltrumenu,
tried with success in the poor-house or bettsring-houfe in v
Philadelphia j especially npou a man who was unable to
c liit his right hand to his head, as was tried beforehand, but .
y who after a few minutes operation, was able to remove it "
t i-.t pleasure ; and in my fight, put it with e.afe on the top '
- of his hea l and back of his neck, and in all directions.
Nearly the fame eifeft took place upon a woman ; and v
:, all that I saw treated, profeffed that their pains <-cased r
1- after being treated a (hort time : and several cattje yolun
n tarfly, and in my hearing thanked the Dr. for cures he 1
"e had performed on them ahout eight weeks before, in re- c
rs moving pains from them, which they declared had not
~e fin; e returned :âfo that from wHa( I saw with my own
a and what I have heard, I have great hopes that this
f, methed will greatly tend to alleviate the miseries of man

Ie Dr. Perkins's invention for removing pains' from the
id human body, begins to obtain reputation in proportion
