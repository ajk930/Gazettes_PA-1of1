BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS.
Tburfday, December B.'
REPORT OF THE BUDGET.
Mr. Hobart brought up the report of the com
mittee of ways and means. The report was read a
firft time. When the resolutions were about to be
read a second time.
Mr. Fox rose. He said, that be should not now
enter into the detail of tliofe resolutions, hut (hould
reserve his remarks for a future opportunity. In
the mean time he would fay, that they were well
worth the attention of every member of the house
and of the community who had ever studied the bu
siness of finance. It would appear to every impar
tial mind that these statements were delusive, and
that and far greater efforts must be made to
put us in a situation to meet our difficulties. What
"he more particularly alluded to at present was, the
degiaded situation in which the house now stood
with refpeft to the Executive Power. They were
yesterday informed, for the firft time, that a sum of
1,20e,0001. had been sent into Germany by the
fervam of the Crown, against a positive law, and
not only without the aflent, but without the know
ledge of Parliament. That this was dene in con
tempt of law, and for the nfbre convenience of his
majesty's ministers, was of itfelf fuffieiently alarm
ing ; but it became infinitely more so, on regard
ing the mifchievotts principle which it furnifhed.
This (truck him at firft, but so powerfully on re
consideration, that lie regretted deeply his not dif
fering fiom the resolutions of yesterday. He now
haftenee-to -repair his fault, and he should deem him
felf ;a traitor to the constitution, if he agreed to
vote either a man or a (hilling, before that house
had solemnly pronounced on the condu& of mini
sters. They had frequently heard panegyrics on the
constitution from those who were employed in de
stroying its vital parts. But there was one point
of its excellence on which he thought that all par
ties must be agreed, and that if the question were
a/ked, whether the priviledge of granting pecunia
ry aids was vested in the Crown or in the people,
the answer must uniformly be, that it was veiled in
the latter, and exercised through their representa
tives.
If unforefeen exigencies had required a larger
supply than had been voted, and if ministers had
fairly come forward and stated the ciicumftance, it
was experimentally clear that they might hare reli
ed on the full confidence of Parliament. But in
this cafe they had been guilty of a direst breach of
the aonftitution. Enquiries had been made in the
last Parliament, whether any money had been sent
into Germany. The answer was in the negative ;
and it was coupled with an intimation, that if such
a fuceour was deemed necessary, they would imme
diately aflemble the Parliament. But what was
now the fa& ? They had disposed of the mÂ»nev
not only without convening the Parliament, but
they had exported it without confultihg the Parli
ament, whilfi it <was aSually !âWhy had
not the Mtnilter come to Parliament, and a(ked
their concurrence ? He would argue with him on
this head. He spoke the language of the constitu
tion. The .question between them was, whether
that constitution should be altered in its most mate
rial part ? whether the power of the purse (hould
reft with the executive power, or with the commons
of England ? and whether the Minister should be
allowed to eilablifh a precedent against the constitu
tion. ?
The manner in which this business had been
condufted was fufficient to add much to the suspi
cion. Large sums were advanced, it appeared be
fore the meeting of Parliament ; but these were
fludioufly concealed. Other payments had been
made so lately as the month of November 1796
All this was done as if with an intent to (hew thit
the power resided in the fervaats of the crown.
When the minister at length came forward, there
was certainly nothing apologetic in his manner: he
appeared to set his own judgment above that of
Parliament, and talked of the danger of publicity
in matters of this nature. To atgue the firft at
these points would be to recÂ»r to the old question;
whether an abfoluie was preferable to a free go- ]
vernment ? With refpeft to the danger of publici
ty, if that were admitted, it would open a door to
every species of fraud, which may be committed
â¢n the most falfe and (lighted pretences. The
Parlisment was not to judge either of the propriety
of granting a pecuniary foccour, or of
to be iflued ; it was held fufficient for th m to be
informed of the tranfaitipÃ at the instant when the
money was to be paid 1
This was the firft time, he proceeded to ebferve,
â¢ that the budget had been opened before the aimy
cxtraordinaries had been voted. This could not be
attributed to any particularity as to the time ; for
it was observable, that last year the budget had been
open precisely on the fame day, and yet the army
cxtraordinaries had been previously voted. These
extraordinaries, which covered a part of this tranf
aflion, had been brought in but yesterday. The
affair was put in a peculiar train, in order to eftab
-li(h the precedent, left it should be thought that
Parliament by any conftruflion or convenience,
had contributed to fanSien the measure.
There were other circumstances in the proceed
ings of yesterday not less Angular in their nature.
The house was then, for the firft time, informed
that there was a war with Spain, tho' the intima
tion had been publicly given by the lord lieutenant
of Ireland, notice for granting letters of
marque and reprisal had appeared in the Gazette,
and though every newspaper was full of the lioftili
ties.âlt was undoubtedly the prerogative of the
crown to make war ; but without studying to a(k
how far this tardy csmmunieation was to be con
lidered as gracious, he must return, and re-demand
why the king's fervantshad usurped the fun&ions
of parliament > The extraordinaries were granted
Â®nly upon estimated Jevices ; the mo.iey was divert
ed from those services, and how was it to be got
back? Theferviceshad been voted, and the house
were now compulforily called upon not to leave
them unprovided. The vote of credit was limited,
ic order to (hew that parliament conGdered thenj N
felves as the only judges, not only whether the mo.
nev Oiculd Le advanced, but to what intent i' should
be applied. Then what power had the minister
for these ifPif.i ?To A- last parliameÂ«t, obfeq>itoÂ«Â»
as it had been, and whatever evil it had committe ,
he had not dared to apply. The obvious mifchiets
to be feared from fending such a quantity of specie
abroad would have probably prevented them from
granting the necessary powers. What figure, then,
would the present parliament cut in hiitory, if it
had began its career by overlooking fu fatal a prece
dent ? It was probable that the minister may at
length tardily'come forward to ask their fanftion.
But would they, Â« the mean time, fit quietly un
der such an insult to them and to the constitution ?
For his own part, he felt the latter so ttrongly, that
he should eppole the second reading of the , rcfolu
tions, for the purpose of postponing the supply. If
He waifupported in this measure, he should pledge
himfelf immediately to bring forward s motion,
charging the minister with " a high crime and mis
demeanor."âBut if the house did not declaretheir
marked abhorrenceâif they thould unexpe&edly
convive at fucb a tranfaftion, he looked with confi
dence to the spirit orthe people, who could not fail
to express their empkatical disapprobation of such a
business. The speech of the minister yesterday
was, in faÂ£t, a libel on the constitution. . Nothing
in the writi:*gsof Paine had so direct a tendency to
bring it into contempt. If he was fitting on hts trial
for that speech, as a juiyman, he would certainly
return a verdict of " guilty" and fay, that the
malut animus to deftrey the constitution was evi
dent. Many ofits bleffiiig, had been taken away,
but we should therefore be the more studious to pre
serve the remainder. The adts which prevented
Englishmen from meeting had (truck at vital parts.
If the power of pecuniary aid was now to be taken
from the commons, he must fry that little more was
left, and that, after all our losses of blood andtreaf
ure, this formed an addition almost incalculable to
our mifcrie,. He should vote, for the reasons which
he had Rated, again!! the second reading of the refo
lutious.
Mr. Pitt said, that if he were not aware how far
the right honorable gentleman, who had just fat
down, was habituated to the ufeof inflammatory ex
prefiionsâif this had been the firft time of his
founding the alarm that'the constitution was in
danger, he should have felt some imprcilioa of sur
prize. But he recollefted that that was-not the
firft time that the gentleman made a solemn appeal
from that house to the people : and that it was not
the firft, second, or third time that he had piofefTed
to ttand " behind the lilt dyke ef the constitution."
ThÂ« meafurcs to which, in his opinion, and in that
of the house, the country had owed its fafaty, were
denounced from the fame quarter, as tending to na
tional ruin!âlt was not many months since the
honorable gentleman had represented those laws as
subversive of the constitution, which had happily
fruftrated the design, of its most inveterate and
dangerous enemies. Under those laws he had pro
reffed that he could not sleep for an hour; and yet
he very lately given a two months notice of a
motion for their repeal.
It was Angularly curious to observe the new lights
which had broken in on the mind of that right hon.
gentleman. IÂ» his (Mr. Pitt's) speech of yester
day, which was allowed to profefs, at least, the
recommendations of opennefa and candor, there was
nothing which appeared in the firft instance to pro
duce the impression which had lately appeared
There was nothing to disturb the farenity, or im
c*'cu'at ' on> Â°f an honorable gentleman
(Mr. Grey) whose mind was particularly liable to
irritation. The hoÂ»orable gentlemen were placid
even after the constitution had received its death
wound, and had aftually fuffered the resolution. to
pass by an unanimous vote ; but now, what was
the tendency of the speech which they had just
heard ? It want not to punift the minister,, if they
were culpable, but to revenge their fins upan the
country. The resolutions, it was to be observed,
did not go to bind the house to fanflien any s up .
plies forwarded to the emperor, either as to their
principle or their extent; the motion was therefore
calculated to inform the enemy, when they were just
informed of the ÃBa nrmity and zeal of the country,
that the house of commons had intercepted ttrr fup
jdtes, and that they were determined to weaken the
war or to fruftrate the ncgociation.

on the grounds 'which he h.d adopted,
than ai q, lt cd on the proof of an opposite conduft!
If Ihc proceeding has t.e Cn less juft,fied by precedent
in his opinion it Wd hive Seen more merit iriou*.
The question now before the house was, whethci
it was prepared to surrender to France, by a com
pliance with the motion of the right honorable gen
tleman, every thing on which the fafety of the
nation depended !
Mr. Fox said a few words in explanation.â
What he had said of the extraordiuanes was, that
if they were refufed, some branch of the public
service must be starved. This made it the more
dangerous and blameable to resort to them, for the
purpose of covering a different expenditure.
Sir W. Pulteney said, that the measure of the
minister, which was now questioned, appeared to
him, in the firft instance, at criminal and uncondi
tional. He had not slept on the business ;he had
on the preceding night communicated his opinion
to his friends around him. If Mr. Fox had spoken
too strongly on other occasion,, that wa, no reason
why he should not be attended to when there ap
peared a real danger. The confutation Â»f the
country appeared to him to depend on this question
Whether the minister ftiould be allowed to fur
nifh latge pecuniary aids without the consent of
parliament.'âThe defence set up on this occasion
he thought extremely weak. The expenditure
could not be covered by the vote of extraordinaries,
which' included only the charges which had been
previously set down in tjie estimate. It could not
be fanÂ£tioned by a vote of credit, for no minister
had ever dared to convert any part of a vote of cre
dit to a foreign subsidy. A, to the obfeivations
on the flopping the supplies, this was the usual
shelter of every minister. He did not cont-ur in the
motion made by Mr. Fox ; but if this pica was
granted in its extent to Mr. Pitt, there was an end
to the power and interference of parliament. He
would freely admit, that, in cafe of a new emergen
cy, minister, were entitled to a responsible difcretion-.
He could not but remark, that the minister had
made no remark to the strongest part of the allega
tionâthat this money wa, remitted whillt parlia
ment was fitting, and without making to them the
fmalltft communication. This furnifhed, in his
opinion, a most deftru&ive precedent, and the con
duct of the minister, on the whole, demanded the
strongest cenlnrc of parliament. He had approved
of his interference in the affairs of Holland in the
year nB7 ; but what made the difference was ; tbat
at that time the parliament was not fitting. With
refpedt to the danger of publicity, he drew a con
trary inference from tbat of the minister. France
was encouraged, when fha learned that we had rc
fufed supplies to Austria. In this instance the
notoriety of the tranfaiftion must have difcooraged
the enemy in proportion as it tended to Simulate
our ally. The difference of exchange was in this
view but a paltry consideration. He saw much to
blame in the encreafe of the navy debt, and could
pointfut many existing abuses ; but in his opinion
the gross infringement on the constitution should be
the prime objeft of regard and of enquiry.
Mr. Grey said, that after the very able and con
ftitutional speech of the honorable b-ronet, whose
experience and independence gave weight and au
thority to every exercise of his discernment, he
would not long detain the house from doing its du
ty upon the question. "But the right honorable
gentleman would perceive, from the questions put
to him in the last parliament, that some suspicion
of his present conduit then existed in the minds of
his opponents. He (Mr. Grey) had then aflced
him whether fee intended to fend money to the em
peror ; to which no pofitivc answer had been given.
If the minister eould thus dare to iuvade one of
cfTetitinl ar.d few remaining pair, of the confti-ution,
it was time to save those parts, by declaring him
guilty of a high crime and misdemeanor. His hon
orable fiiend, he hoped, would io morrow make a
motion to that effe6t ; and if Mr. Fox did not, he
(Mr. Gicy) gave notice that he would. Such a
declaration, he hoped, would prevent the mifchief
of the present offence, and the attempting of auy
similar one, in future. The minister h rt d upbraided
his opponents with having frequently declared that
the queltion under difcuffian formed the last dyke of
the constitution. It was true that they had often
proclaimed iheir apprehensions, from violence at
one time, from fraud and treachery at another ;
and the house were now ta f v -el the conftquence of
the servility of their predeceffoi,, is the last parlia.
ment. If, for thi, offence, they did not now
bring the minister to trial and puniftiment, there
was nothing left even of the form of a constitution.
Ihe indignation of the house wa, already excited
by the firft disclosure of this offence ; but what
would it be when they should learp that which
he had now discovered from the papeon the
table, that, at the very time when the minister
was talking of his openness under all difficulties,
and under the exccfs of commercial inconvenien
cies, at the very time, parliament being then
fitting, he had given to the emperor the greatest
pan of the sum, which, till within these few
ays, the house did not know to have been ex
pended at all. The last parliament fat till June.
It appeared, from the papers on the table, that
before thst
1,200,0001. had betÂ« sent to the Emperor ; in
July 77,e001. wa, sent ; and in September, Ofto
an? November, 900,000! so that, except
77.0001. the whole of this sum, of with
out the consent of Parliament, had dually been
lo miiapphed dtiring the fitting of Parliament. It
was even now a d.ubt with him, whether, "If he had
not Kcffed for those army extraordinaries, which
were so lately la.d upon the table, the house would

We are happy to find that a considerable number
of our unfortunate fellow-citizens rutu-ned lately
from Algiers, have provided -employment for thÂ«m
felves, and Shipped on board different outward bound
veflels. Four mariners failed in the Â£hip John, a
few days since, for Amsterdam uin this number,
was a poor fellow, who had been in slavery amongst
the Barbarians, for more than 12 yeais.
Yesterday was the anniversary of the birth day
of the President of the United States, when heen
tted the 65th year of hit age. The day was ah
ferved with utiufual demonstrations of feftivity and
rejoicing. The dawn was ushered in by the bring
a federal salute of frxteen cannon and the ringing of
l, e l! 8 âthe Senate as Ae United States, molt of the
members of the federal house of reprefentativesâ
the governor and both branchesiof the legislature
of this commonwealth in a body escorted by seve

on the occasion. The officers of the militia of the
city and county met at eleven o'clock at the Stare
house, and marched from thence to the house of the
President, to whom they presented an addressâthey
then returned to the State House and accompanied
the society of the Cincinnati in their visit to the
President, who also presented an address. The Pre
fident received also the congratulations of foreign
public charaftersj and of a Numerous concourse of
citizens, ladies and gentlemen. At 12 o'clock ano

was a ball and supper, given on the occasion by the

Senate of the United States, February 21.
The answer to the Address of the Vice Pefident
ofthe United States on his relirirfg the Senate,
was yesterday, agreed to as follows.
Sir, _ â
The Senate of the United States would be un
just to their own feelings, and deficient in the per
formance of a duty their relation to the government
of their Country imposes, Should they fail to ex
press their regard for your person, and their ref
peft for your chara&et", in answer to the address
you presented to them, 011 your leaving a Ration
which you have so long and so honorably filled, as
their President.
The motives you have been plea fed to disclose
which induced you not to withdraw from the pub
lic feivice, at a time when your experience, talents
and virtues were peculiarly defneable, are as hono
rable soÂ» youtfelf, as from our confidence in you,
Sir, we trwft the refalt will be beneficial to our be
loved country.
When you retired fiom your dignified feat in
this House, and took your leave of the members of
the Senate, we felt all thole emotions ol gratitude
and affection, which our knowledge and experi
ence of your abilities and undeviating impartiality
ought to inspire ; and we (honld with painful reluc
tance endure the separation, but for the corifoling
reflexion, that the fame qualities which have ren
dered you nfcful, as the President of this branch of
the Legislature, will enable you to beftill more so,
in the exalted to which you have been called.
From you, Sir, in whom your country have for
a long period, placed a steady confidence, which has
r.ever bwn betrayed or forfeited, and to whom 1 hey
have on so nrany oecaGons eni.rufted the care of their
dearest interests, whieh have never been abufad.â
From you who holding the fecend situation under
the Coriftitution of the United Siates, have lived
in uninterrupted harmony with him who has held
the firft.â
From you wÂ« receive with much fatisfaAion the
declaration which" you are pteafed to make of the
opinion you entertain of the character of the pre
sent fenaters, and of that of those citizens who
kave oeen heretofore senators. This declaration,
were other motives wanting, would afford them an
incentive to a virtuous perseverance, in that line of
condufl which has been honoied with your appro
bation.
In your future course, we entertain no doubt,
that your official condufl, will be measured by the
constitution, and dire&ed to the public good, you
have therefore aright to entartain a confident reli-.
*nce, that you will be supported, as well by t he peo
ple at laige as by their constituted authorities.
We cordially reciprocate the wifhrs which yon
express for our honor, health and bappinefs, we
jeiu with yours, our fervent prayers for the continu
ation of the virtue* aud liberties ef eur fellow citi
- 'â¢ . ' '"I
reus : for the pubtfo ptofperity and peace ; Â»t)d for
you we implore the bell reward of virtuous deeds,

" Our Peace with the Interns is likely to be of
ftlurt. duration. The Indiana and White People
have already been killing one another. The dispute
firft began by the Indians plundering three waggons
loaded, palling from Knoxville to Cumljcrland.â
Since that tinac, two men living in Powell's Vale,
murdered two Indians who were hunting on the
Wilderness road, and plundered their camp. This
day we hear the Indians have killed Colonel Daniel
Boone, his son, and son-iB-law, when out viewing
lands on Red River. This latter report wants con
firmation, though it comes pretty direst."

While raptar'd states in gratitude beitow
Their thanks, for blessings, which to thee they owe."
