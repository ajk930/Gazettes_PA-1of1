1794, having this day conltituted their Board,
pursuant and agreeably to the said treaty, do here
by give notice, tbat they are ready to proceed to
business accordingly; and they desire that all claims
under the fiid article (which so far asthe fane de
fcrihes the cases thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
They further desire that all fnch claims may not
only ftatc in what manner the several cases come
within the description of the said article, but also
specially set forth .he nature of the evidence by
which the claimants refpeitivcly undertake tofub
ftantiate the fame
ExirsS from the said article,
" Whereas-itis alledged by divrrs Britilh ijier
" chants, and others his majesty's fubjstSs, that
" debts to a confid rable amount, which were bona
" fide contra 6ted, before the peace, still remain
" owing to thetn by citizens or inhabitants of the
" United States ; and that by the eperation of va
" rious lawful impediments, since the peace, not
" onjy the full recovery of the said debts has been
" delayed, but also the value and security thereof
" have been in several instances impaired and less
" ened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial
" proceedings, the British creditors cannot now
" obtain and actually have and receive full and
" adequate compensation for the losses and dama
" ges which tney have thereby fuf ained: It is a
" greed that in all such cases where full compenfa
" tion for such lolTcs and damages cannot for what"
" ever reason be adlujlly obtained, had and recei
" ved by the said creditors in the ordinary "course
" of justice, the United States will make fall and
" complete compensation for the fame to the said
" creditors : but it is diftinftly understood, that
" this provision is to extend so such losses only as
" have been occasioned by the lawful impedimenta
" aforefaid, and is not 10 extend to loflcs occasion
" ed by such iÃfolvency of the debtors or other
" causes, as would equally have operated to pro
" duce such loss, if the said impediments had not
" existed ; nor to such losses or damages ?s have
" been occasioned by the manifeft delay, or negli
'â¢ t,eiÂ»cc, or wilful omission of the claimant."

for the purpose of bringing forward the fame agree
ably so the rules and orders which the board may
think proper to prescribe.
And as it will be for the interest of all concerned,
that the several claims be so slated, and fupport
cd, as to prevent the delay which would arise from
the neceffityof obtaining lurther information, or ad
ditional materials.from persons residing at a diltance,
the geceral agent thinks it his dut<Â»to add, (for the
direÂ£lion chiefly-of those, who. not having employ
ed parlicular agents, may leave the prosecution of
thcir'claims to his charge and management) that all
such claims ought in particularto set forthâ
id. The proper dafcrip ion arid function of the

4th. The loss and damage incurrefl or sustained,
in consequence ot luch impediments, whether the
fame may have arisen from the infolveuev, change of

havefo operated if such impediments had not existed.
And sth The particular grounds and reaTons on
which the claimant maintains, in the terms of the
treaty, that " by the ordinary course of judicial pro

have and teceive full and adequate compensation" for
the losses and damages lofuflaiued.
The general agent thinks it his duty further to fÂ»g

ed to possess the public mind with an erroneous
opinion of the tranfafiions that have taken place
ktwecr) him and me. h statement of fafls, with
precision as to the time and ord'.r, willexpftfe the
of the attempt.
1 did not receive from major de Eutts. anf in
timation that fhajor Burrows laid he would meet
me at the time proposed, if infilled u'pen- I prc
fnme as nÂ® such communication was made to me
by maj'if <ie Butt% that this irupirrtant cirCuiri
flance catitict form a part in major Burrows s de
fence.
After the i'llinustion of major Burrows, a dif
lant hi.ur wasiimprop;r, nor could I with confilt*
but regard to my charaiter be content with gene
ral lonfe declarations, tha,t major Burrows would
give i.*' all the fatisfaftion a man of honor could
require, as major Burrows did not pro
pofr any time for our meeting, or fay he would
ripply to a friend to make the arrangement: either
bl these circunlltauees would have prevented my
JiuMid-ition.
I did agree to meet major Furrows at Cooper's
ferry, Sunday motningat fix o'clock; this arra'nge
'hient was made at eight o'clock Saturday evening;
tile fiixne evening abuut lulf pal ten o'clock, the
propofed'interview with major Burrows never
having been mentioned by me, nor any circum-
IfancJ" havnig occurred, to my knowledge, that
could lead to a suspicion of the measure that was
in contimplat on, .1 was arretted by the constable
with a warrant from the chief ehaigicgan
intended duel, between major Burrow s and myfelf
â¢ âI proposed to pledge my word to the eenftable,
that ! woiild appear next morning at ten o'clock
before the chief, justice, and ti keep the peace in
the mean time ; the confta'nle declared he would
lodge me in jail, unlcfs I would give him my
vrord andhonor, I would net moled, hurt, or in
jure the person of major Burrows before fen
o'clock the next morning ; Irefufed until taken
within twp fquarcs of the.jail, and was then
obliged to'comply to prevent immediate lmprifon
meut; I immediately called on Mr. Higbee and
told him 1 was arreted, and desired him to ac-
OjUiint General M'Pherfon with the circumstance,
which he did on Sunday morning, and Mr. Higbee
called on me after having seen G r.'eral M'Pherfon,
and I then tol-J him, that 1 could not deviate from
my word of honor which I had been compelled to
pledge to the co/i liable, and requeued him to men
t on this as my fituatios, and to add that this diffi
culty would not always continueâThese were my
inftru<Sions to Mr. Higbee. I understand he cal
ltdon General M'Pherfon and afterwards saw both
him aad major Burrows; for what paiTed between
them I mult r fer to Mr. Higbee and General
M'Pherfoli, to whom I did not appeal to know
how I Ihould afl, although he evinced a flrong dif
polition for conciliation.
Yesterday having heard the affair misrepresent
ed, and the impediment of Sunday morning being
then removed, I applied to my friend Mr. 1 homas
Bourke, authorized and requeftcd him to make a
communication to General M'Pherfon anil Major
Burrow*, the particulars of which major Burrows
knows cirfumftances at present forbid ma to state
which had it met a fimiiar disposition On the part
of major Burrows, would brought us together
in one hour ; the meff.ge was faithfully delivered
by Mr. Thomas Bourkc, and the proposal was de
clined
1 accepted his invitation and was prevented not
as he represents it by the order to wait on the thief
justice at 10 o'clock, but by my plighted word to
the peace officer, which I was conftiaine'd tÂ» give
to av *ld being imprisoned. This incident reftri<sl
tdme until ten o'clock. The day aVcr this diffi
cult being out of the way, I proposed what major
Burrow' 3 knows would have brought forward an
immediate interview, if he had discovered a simi
lar disposition, and to complete the impropriety of
Â«iiis conduit, he now makes his appeal upon a par
tial representation, knowing 1 am not at liberty to
ilate all that passed, the particulars of which shall
appear as soon as it may be consistent with my fafe
ty in a point of view, in which asjttajcr Burrows
is himfeif apprised, my (ffcntial interelts at pre
sent impose a Gler.ce as to fonie part of the pro
ceedings.
Wuh regsra to my being " an intemperate
young man." 1/ do not helitate to declare, that
many people unacquainted with all the circum
stances that have transpired, within the lait week
may be of that opinion ; 1 am however confident,
that it r.iuft be admitted that major Burrows's an
fwer to my note of Bth infta it, must be consider
ed equally remarkable for its want of sensibility.
I now join major Burrows in an appeal to the
pu ric to decide on our conduit, and aft, whether
it is iivfyutable 1.0 any backwardness on my part that
we have not met. I conceived myfelf much in
jure;!, 1 invited tnajor Burrows to the field at an
early hour. A compliance with my firft invitation
would have infureii an interviewâit was evaded
by him.
As a refutation of major Burrows's n ta bene,
the affidavit of the conttable is hereto added, and
will shew the diffident ground 011 which we were
placed in the particulars riferred to in the said no
ta bene.
WILSON BUNT.
Patrick Dixon, being duly f\Vorn, declares and
fay*, that on Sunday lalt he received a warrant
signed by the chief justice nf this commonwaalth,
to apprehend Mr. Wilson Hunt, and bring him
before the chief justice; that at about half after
ten o'clock on Saturday night hs arrested Mr.
Hunt by virtue of the said warrant; that bail was

and would not fuffer to be taken : that the depon

out of the house with an intention to lodge him in
jail, that he proceeded withl\ r. Hunt within two
fquarcs of the jail, Mr. Hunt endeavoring by
threats and promises to let him go. At lalt the
deponent informed Mr. Hunt, that if he would
pledge his word and honor that he would not mo
lest, hurt, or injure the person of major William
W.Burrows; and ta be at the house of the chief
justice at'ten o'clock next day, he would let him
go, other-.vileTie would put him in prison ; where
upon Mr. Hunt, (the deponent suppose-) feeing
that there was no other mean's by which he could
avoid imprjfonment, did solemnly pledge his word
and honor in the manner above mentioned. Ihe

REPORT
Of the Secretary of State, to the President
of the United States, of the proceedings
of Andrew Ellicott, Commif
fioner for running the boundary line bet
ween the United States, and East and
Weft Florida.
Department of State,
June 10, 1797.
The. Secretary of State refpedtfully re
ports to the President of the United States,
the substance of the information received tlie
Bth inft. from Andrew Eljicott, Esquire,
the Commiflioner of'the United States ap
pointed to run the boundary line between
their territory and his Catholic Majesty's
Colonies of East and Weft Florida.
Although Mr. Ellicott left Philadelphia,
in September, 1796, to proceed by the
Ohio and Miffifippi rivers, to the Natchez,
the place appointed by the Treaty with
Spain, at which the Comrm'ffioners of the
two governments were to meet, yet owing,
to the lownefs of the waters of the Ohio, he
did not reach its mouth until the 19th day
of December ; two days after which, both
the Ohio and Miffifippi were almoll frozen 1
over. On the 21ft January, the ice began
to give way, and their store boat arriving on
the 28th, they proceeded on the 31ft for the
Natchez. On the 21ft February, Mr. Elli
cott received a letter, (No. I.) from his
Catholic Majesty's Governor, Gayofo dc ,
Lemos, dated at the Natchez the 17 th Fe- !
bruary, mentioning the information he had
received of his appproaching arrival, attend- |
cdby.a military guard and l'ome woodsmen, !
and desiring that the, troops might be left a- ;
bout the Mouth of Bayon Pierre ; afiigning j
for hia reason, that thereby every unforefeen
njifunderftanding between the troops of the i
two powers wouldbe prevented. With this
request, from -views of accommodation, Mr.
Ellicott complied. Bayon Pierre is about
60 miles above the Natchez.
On the 24th February, Mr. Elh'cottreach
ed the Natchez, and immediately by a let- i
ter, acquainted Governor Gayofo, of his
arrival.. The Governor on the fame day re
turned an answer, (No. 2.) The day fol
lowing they had an interview, and fixed on
the 19th of March to proceed down the ri
ver to Clarkefville, near which it was sup
posed the line would commence. The Mon
day following, Februaay 27th, Mr. Elli
cott wrote a letter (No. 3.) to the Baron
de Carondelet, his Catholic Majesty's Go
vernor General of Louisiana, and the Com
miflioner named by the Court of Spain, for
ascertaining the boundary line, to inform him
of his arrival at the Natchez,- as the Com
mifiioner of the United' States. The Ba
ron's answer, (No. 4.) dated March ift,
was received the 9th, and on the fame day
Governor Gayofo waited on Mr. Ellicott,
and informed him that the Baron, in conse
quence of interesting concerns below,'liad
declined to attend, and that the whole bu
siness had devolved on him. Mr. Ellicott
expressed his fatisfa&ionj because he expect
ed that he, Governor Gayofo, would be
immediately ready to proceed. The Gov
ernor answered, â" No time (hall be loft ;
" but I fear I (hall not be ready by the
" 19th ; and although the Baron declines
" adting 011 account of the business which
" demands his constant attention at Orleans,
" he is nevertheless desirous of having an
'â¢ interview with you ; and for that purpose
" has ordered a galley to be fitted up for
" ypur use and accommodation to New Or
" leans.'â-Mr. Ellicotr considered that the
third article of the treaty with Spain, re
quired the Commiflioners for running the
boundary line to meet at the Natchez ; and
that being then at his post, it was his duty
to remain there, until the Spanish Commis
sioner (hould be ready to proceed with hir*;
to the place where the line fho'uld commence
âand therefore he declined the Baron'S invi
tation.
On the 27th of February, Mr, Ellicott
encamped at the upper end of the town of
Natchez, about a-quarter of a mile from the
i fort- ocupied by the Spanish troops ; and
. two days after hoisted the flag of the United
I States. Upon this he received a verbal mef
i f :ge from Governor Gayofo, by his aid,
Major Minor, desiring the flag might be
! |aken down, which Mr. Ellicott declined do
j ing. The request Was Yiot repeated. Here Mr.
i Ellicott began his aftrononvical observations,
; and fouxjl the hill on whichhe was encamp
| ed, to be in latitude 31 o. 33'. 46". or a
; bout 39 miles north of the south boundary
i of the United States.
In this situation, Mr. Ellicott was told
â  alarming stories about the unfavorable cjjf
' polit,ion of the Indians, under an idea that
: the United States were meditating their de
| ftrudtion. The whole settlement was for
some days fvvarming with them ; and they
knives. For his own fafety he frequently
iffucd provisions to them. Thus critically
circumstanced, he, on the nth of March,
wrote to Governor Gayofo the letter, No.
5, to which he received the answer, No. 6.
But in the mean timg, Mr. Ellicott had
sent an express to the commanding officer of
his escort (consisting of only 25 men) which,
in comphiiianeeto the governor's firft request,
he he had It* lixty miles up the river, to
come down diredtly to the Natchez.âAnd
being determine;! not to countermand this
order/ he, 011 the 13th, wrote to governor
Gayofo the letter, No. 7. propoling Bacon's
landing, about a mile below*his camp, for
the station of his escort; but before this
letter was sent, he had an interview with the
governor, who undertook to prove the pro
priety and necessity of the whole party from
the United States going down to Clark's
place, and closed his reasoning by observing,
That if the escort did land at thfe Natchez,
he (hould consider it as an insult offered to
the king his master. Mr. Ellicottthentelling
thegovernor, that he fhpuld fend him immedi
atelyananfwerin writing,obferved. That the
desire which was constantly manifefted to
draw him from \!he Natchez)
appended very lingular, as it was dcfignated
in the late treaty Jjetween his Catholic ma
jesty and the United States, as the place of
meeting for the commiflioners 5 and therefore,
that he (hould reject every propofitioa that
was intended to draw him from his present
situation, until the commiflioner and furvey
oron behalf of the crown of Spain were rea
dy to proceed to business. To which the
governor replied, " Sir, you either mistake
" my meaning, or I have expressed myfelf
u very badly. Ido not want you to leave
" this place, but on the contrary, lam de
" firous for you to take up your residence
" in my house ; you will live there ,much
" more comfortably than in a tent." Mr.
Ellicott faid, v that his tent was much more
agreeable than a palace ; for in his camp h*
enjoyed an independence charadteriftie of
the nation he had the honor to represent.
The next morning, Mr. Ellicott sent his
letter, No. 7. and the fame day received the
governor's answer, No. 8, expressing his
entire fatisfadtion with Mr. Ellicott's senti
ments, as uniformly agreeing with his own,
in every thing which could combine the mu
tual interests of the two nations.
The evening following,. (March 15th)
Mr. Ellicott's escort arrived at the landing,
and the next day Went down to. the place he
had proposed for their station.
The officer of the escort having found in
the settlement a number of deserters from
the American army, took them up. This
oc<Â»fioned some verbal communications be
tween governor Gayofo and Mr. Ellicott,
the former desiring the deserters might be
difmifled.' Mr. Ellicott thereupon proposed
this arrangement: That such deserters from
the army of the United States as came into
that country, and took the protedtion of the
Spanish government prior to the time fixed
by the treaty for the evacuation of the posts,
(hould, for the present, remain unmolested;
but that such as had come to that country '
since that time (hould be liable to he taken 1
and detained.
About the time Mr. Ellicott's escort ar- 1
rived, the principal part of the artillery was '
taken out of the fort and carried to the land
ing? and every appearance made of a speedy
evacuation ; but on the 22dof March, great
industry was used ir carrying cannon back
to the fort, which were immediately re
mounted. This gave great alarm to the in
habitants of the diftridt, who generally ma
nifefted a desire of being declared fubjedts of 1
ftie United States, "and at once to renounce
the Spanish jurifdidtion. In order to quiet :
the minds of the inhabitants, and to be able
to give them some reasons for the governor's
condudt, which now began to be considered 1
as hostile io the United States, Mr. Elli
cott, on the 23d of March, wrote the letter,
No. 9, which was followed by a note, No.
10, to which he received the governor's au- -
fwer, No. 11. This answer, containing in
formation that the important business of
running the boundary line should soon be
commenced, and an assurance that nothing
could prevent the religious compliance with
the treaty, Mr. Ellicott expressed his fatis
fadtion in his letter to the governor, No. 12.
It being now reported, that the Ameri
can troops would be down in a few days,
the governor sent by his aid, to Mr. Ellicott,
an open letter from the governor diredted to
captain Pope, who, it was said commanded
those troops, informing him, that for fundrv
reasons it would be proper, and conducive j
to the harmony of the two nations,,for him
felf and the detachment under his command
to remain at or near the place where the let- 1
ter should meet him, until the posts should be 1
evacuated ; and as every preparation was i
making for that purpose, the delay would be 1
but a tew days, when he would be happy
to fee him at the Natchez. This proposal to
captain Pope, the governor, in his letter,
No. 13, desired Mr- Ellicott to second.
Upon reading the letter, Mr. Ellicott ob
served to major Minor, that it was impossible
for him to join in the governor's request to
captain Pope, as it was well known to him,
(Mr. Ellicatt) that instead of evacuating
the posts, they were making theiTi more de
fenfible. However, Mp. Ellicott said, he
would write a letter to the officer command
ing the detachment, at\d requested major
Minor (as he was-to l>c the bearer -of the
governor's letter to the Hills) to :
take charge of it; to which he had no ob
jediion. This letter is No. 14. 1
On the 28th of March, the if- â 
fuedthe Proclamation, No. 15, bearing the i
date of March 29th, and another, No. 16, 1
bearing the fame date, with the avovved ob- 1
jedt of quieting the minds of the inhabi- :
tants ; but they produced a contrary effedt.
As soon as the Governor discovered this,
requested two gentlemen of the settlement,
to inform Mr. Ellicot that he, the Gover
nor, had received diredtions from the Gene
rat in Chief, the Baron de Carondelet, to
j have the artillery and military (lores exjpedj-
immediately to be given up to the troops of
the United States iipon their arrival. Great
pains were, taken to inculcate this report ;
but it did not remove fufpieions. In order,
therefore, to obtain a direst explanation,â
Mr. Ellicott, on the 31ft of March, wrote
to the Governor the letter No 17, inclosing
two paragraphs, No. iÃj of an address he
had received from a number of refpeftable
inhabitants of the DiUriel. The Gover
nor's answer, No. 19, of the fame date,
confirmed every suspicion, as it contained
art explicit declaration, that his general had
him pontive orders to suspend the
evacuation of the pails until the two Gov
ernments fhQiild determine, whether the
works were to be left Handing, or to be <te
molifhed ; and until, by an additional arti
cle to the treaty, the real property of the in
habitants (hould be secured ; agreeably to
his Proclamations, in which the Governar
thought proper to tell the inhabitants, -thÂ±
negotiations were on foot between his Ca
tholic Majesty and the United States, for
the adjustment of that and other matters.â
It may not be improper to remark, that nts
such negociation has exilled ; and that t n's
is the tirft time that these objections to the
evacuation of the post? have been heard of.-
This peremptory declaration of Governor
Gayofo requires no comment.
Mr. Ellicott fays, that with the exception
of about eight pvrfons, including some offi*
cers, all the inhabitants of the Natchez dil
trift (within the limits of the United States)
are deiirous of coming under their jurisdic
tion, and to have a Government eftabiiflied
there, limilar to that north-weft of the river
Ohio. My enquiries enable me to add, â
that the population amounts to near four
thousand fouls.
Mr. Ellicott further informs, that he has
not only reason to believe,but is certain that
many grants for lands in that diftrift, have
been given out by the officers of the gov
ernment of Louisiana, since the ratification
of the late treaty, and that their surveyors
are now executing the surveys.
011 the 14th of April, when Mr. Elli
cott was folding up his dispatches, he re
ceived from Governor Gayofo the letter,
No. 20, of that dat<?, complaining of the
inliftment of persons in that diftrift, as an
infringement of the rights of his Catholic
Majesty ; and requesting ihat the p'erions
inlifted might be discharged : To which
Mr. Ellicott immediately returned the an
swer, 21 ; observing, that the matter
required investigation ; but a {Turing Gover
nor Gayofo, that he would be careful nei
ther to infringe the rights of the fubjefts of
his Catholic Majesty, nor willingly fuffer
those of the citizens of the United States
to be infringed.
The bearer of Mr. Ellicott's dispatches
informs me, that before he left the Natchez
they had heard that two gun-boats were
preparing at New-Orleans to bring uj> rein
forcements ; and since his arrival I have re
ceived information which, connefted with
this detail of fafts, is entitled to belief,â
That about the tenth of May, three large
boats, full of troops, besides a party by land,
set off from New-Orleans for the Natchez.
It was added, for the purpose of driving off
the Continental troops that had taken pof
felfion, agreeably to the late treatv.

SOME gentlemen that left you at the
mouth of the Ohio, have informed me of
your approaching arrival here, and that to
attend you on your .commission you bring a
military guard and some woods-men.
It is with pleasure, that I propose mvfelf
the fatisfaftion of feeing you here, anil to
make your acquainance.
Though I do not conceivs that the least
difficulty will, arise rÂ«.ipefting the execution
of the part of the treaty in which you are
an afting person j yet, as we are not pre
pared to evacuate the posts immediately, for
want of the vefiels that I expeft will arrive
soon, I find it indifpeniable to request you
to leave the troops about the mouth of Bay
on Pierre, where they may be provided with
all tjjeir neceffacies which you can regulate
on your arrival here. By this means, every
unforefeen misunderstanding will be preven
ted between his Majesty's troops, and those
of the United States ; besides, it is r.ecef
faiy to make fame arrangements previous
to the arrival of the troops, on which fub
jeft I fi'.all have the honor of entertaining
you when we meet.
I embrace thii opportunity to afiure you
of the fatisfaftion I feel in being appointed
to aft in concert with you, though your
firft interview is to be with the General in
Chief of this Province.
I have the honor to be,
with the highest confideratiou, â¢
Sir,
Your ruoft humble,
and obedient servant,
Manuel Gayoso de Eemos.

MY DEAR SIR, 1
The conduct of the Indians yesterday
and last night, owing principally to their 'â 
constant state of intoxication, renders it ab- 1
folutely necessary, in my opinion, to have re- 1
course to my military escort for protection. !
The discipline of our army is such, that you '
may reft assured, none of the inconveniences 1
mentioned in your firft communication to c
me, are to be apprehended from the escort's 1
being stationed at this place on our part
And as the attendance of the guard forms a ,
part of the treaty now carrying into effect 0
between his most Catholic Majesty and the '
United States, which I am authorized to
declare will be observed by the nation I have "
the honor to represent, with good faith and '
punctuality, I mull requeftthe favor of you '
to withdraw your objections against my es
cort's joining me at this place as soon as
possible.
I am, &c. &c.
Andrew Ellicott. '

my dear sir,' p
This morning I had the pleasure to re- ri
ceive your amicable communication, dated rr
yesterday. I give you my sincere thanks m
for having eftablilhedthisform ofintercourfe, ei
as it will make our business more easy, and
indeed it is more conformable to the ijneere tr
friendfhip we have contracted. * ra
In answer to your said letter, I will re- c<
mark, that such conduCt of the Indians is m
not customary here ; I forefaw that it would jo
happen from the moment you shewed a de
sire of haying your colours flying, before all
the transaCtions were terminated ; knowing
the Indians as well as I do, this, was the
reason of the objections I offered the mo
ment I saw it hoisted, for otherwise I know ac
it very well, that it is frequently used by ti<
the representatives of nny nation in aforeign
country ; it's even done in Spain by foreign
Consuls. M
I am sorry you lhould have experienced any
inconveniency from this particular cireum
ftance, and that urged by such effeCta to
vvilh to have by you your escort. I have not th
the least objection that it lhould be called, an
from its aCtual llation ; but as it iÂ« my duty, mi
and that lam anfwerqj>le for the tranquility ca
o'f the country that isentryfted to mycharge, tic
I mull propose to you a method that will fla:
answer every good and fatisfaCtory purpose. gi
Had not you been unluckily ttopped on m;
your voyage to this country,you would have mi
had immediately the General of the Provin co
here, to begih the operation of demarking ef
the divifory line between the territories of
his Catholic Majesty and those of the United
States of America. He had every necessary
preparation to attend to the business ; but
Jioce the time he had a right to expeCt the
Commissioners of the United States, the T!
war with England has taken place, and his
cares thereby increased, yet he cxpeCted to
have had it in his porwer to come to meet
you at Daniel Clarke's, Esq. which place
is near tlje.point of the 31 o, but he has
found it impossible, as it would oblige him pi;
to make too long an abfe'nce from New Or- art
Jeans ; therefore, it is myfelf that will have it,
the honor to accompanyyou on that import of
snt> commission, on behalf of his Catholic W
Majesty. This is the moment when lam in up
want of every individual thing, both for my rei
j erlon, and for the attendants of the com- be
mission, tho' the Geometer -and other offi- pu
cers that are to be employed, are already on m;
their way from New Orleans, and will Hop U
at Clarkefville, where I (ball go myfelf as gi
foon as my equipage arrives from the capi- rei
til { but tliis will inevitably take some time, I;
therefore theplan that I wished to arrange
with you, will be to make Loftus's C/ifts,
our point ofYe union. This place is a-(hort H
distance from Clarkefville, and it is a very
heahbv fit tuition ; âthere I will fend every
tning concerning the eomnvffion ;'
and that will be the moid convenient place to I
eftabliih, for a \Vh:lc, your head quarters,
unuer your military cfcort. By adopting
this measure, you will have' your people to
r"' get her, and the most diftii'nt disagreeable
jÂ£' occurrence avoided, as I am positively con-
fident that fixne Would happen by the cori
\ junction here, as you propose. It is true,
* that by the treaty an escort is fyppofed, a,nd
even recommended to each commission, but
'it' s to be on the line, and not at a distance
from it where it would interfere with other
t business ; therefore I feel feniibly hurt that
it is out of my power to consent in the land
[j ing of the troops in this place, tho' I have
not the least objeClion on their foinz directly
toLoftus's Cliffs.
I have given the most orders to
prevent, the Indians getting liquor ; and to
their interpreter I have given the ftrifteft
charge to be always in fight, and to-morrow
I expCCi that they will remove to some dis
tance from hence.
I have the honor to be, with the highest
refpgCt and esteem,
Your most affeCtionate friend,

MY DEAR SIR, J
YOU R of yesterday v?as handed to '
1 me in du* time, which would have been
answered sooner, had not the storm last night '
prevented me from writing in my. tent
1 our letter, as well as many circumftanees
which have come to my knowledge, contain
frefh proofs of your desire to promote good
order and harmony in this part of the coun- '
try. Cut, !.-, I cannot suppose that any in
convtnience could pofTibly arise, or the peace
of this settlement be disturbed by the arrival
and landing of the escort which I left at â 
Bayon Pierre : If I did suppose the contra- j
ry, I trull that I (hould be one of the last \
persons to propose the measure. In my /
opinion, the escort which accompanied me,
is as much bound to observe good order in
this country, as the troops of his Catholic 0
majesty. This is not an opinion of the day, J
it has uniformly been mine ever since I left c
the feat of our government : In consequence t
of which, immediately upon my entering p
the Miffifippi, I issued a standing order, that b
when any of our party, the military inclu- t,
ded, lhould be at any place where the juris
diction wasexercifed by his Catholic majes
ty, the laws and ufagesrof that government b
lhould be observed and submitted to in the Â«
most pointed manner. The escorts by the a
spirit of the treaty, are inteifded for our mu- f
tual protection against ftragling hostile In- b,
dians, and the preservation of otÂ»;ftores.
This appear to be their whole bulrnefs.
As I hope that mere punctilios may never Â°j
interrupt our friendfhip, and the conduct of Â»'
the Indians having become more peaceable "
fihee the night before last, I am less anxious P
for the escort's being stationed at my pre- J'
sent encampment: I would,''therefore, to r <
prevent any dillurbance or misunderstanding, f:
propoie that the officer who commands the
escort which accompanied me to Bayon
Pierre, be direCted to proceed down the
river to Bacon Landing, from whence he ' '
may come to this place, and procure such
neceffarics as he may be in want of for the
ensuing season. "
As this is the place designated by the
treaty for our meeting, and making our ar
rangement* for carrying on the bulinefs, I
conceive there would be an impropriety in
my leaving it till your excellency is ready to "t
join me in fixing the firft point of latitude. j
I am, &c. See. ta

IHE re-mounting of the cannon at this $/ c
place at the very moment when our troops 0 f
are daily expected down to take pofiefiion of j ee
