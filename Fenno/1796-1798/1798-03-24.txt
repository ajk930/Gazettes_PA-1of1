BRITISH PARLIAMENT.
HOUSE OF COMMONS.
FRIDAY DECEMBBR 22.
ASSESSED TAXES.
Previous to the house going into a com
mittee,
Sir E. Knatchbull moved, that there be
laid before the house an iccoutit of the num
ber of houses under 81. afleffed taxes and
upwards ; fpecifying the number of each
clafs, from 81. to 501. and so on to 220j.
TKÂ« honfe frt a committee,
Mr. Pitt moved a clause, which was a
dopted, fixing those who kept horfea, car
riages, and male servants, at the higher
rate (as already printed.)
Sjr C. Bunbury moved that taxed carts
be exempted from any additional tax.
Mr. Pitt said, as the law now stood,
there was a great deal of evasion in the pay
ment of this tax ; he could not cohfent to
the insertion of such an exempting clause ;
but the amount of the tax might be a iub
je<ft of future consideration.
Mr. Wilberforce wi(hed to raise the tax
on such as kept men servants, fcc. one rate
higher than was proposed.
Mr. Addington (the speaker) explained,
that no augmÂ«at4U9il &f_a ta* could be pro
posed in Â£ cfwtnittee, although a reduction
Bn'gitxr
Mr. Pitt brought up a clause to leflen
the proportion of rates upon (hops and lodg
ing-houses.
Upon the clause for imposing a double
rate upon horses used in huftandry, Mr.
Pitt dated, that it was proposed to exempt
those whose farm rents were under 701. per
annum.
Mr. H. Browne proposed, that from "?01.
and under iool. only a single rate (hvuld
be imposed. â¢ I
After some conversation upon this propo
rtion, the committee divided,
For the original clause, 94
For the amendment, 6
Mr. Pitt brought up the clause requiring
the statement of properly to be upon oath ;
he said, that he conceived the oath to be
ncceflary to give complete effeft to the
flatement ; but as many gentlemen had fig
nified their intention of opposing this part,
he begged to submit to the committee whe
ther it would not be better to refetve the
consideration of that paint until the report,
and in the mean time firft to go through
with the schedule of the mode of dating in
come which would have a considerable in
fluence upon the operation of the other
clause, and would narrow it so much as to
require the intervention of an oath but in
few cases. Upon the report they would
have full opportunity of objedling to the â¢
clause, if they retailed their opinion of the
impropriety ef an oath.
Mr. Pitt brought up another claqfe, that
persons having more than four lawful chil
dren under sixteen years of age (hould be
entitled to abatementâfrom four to eight,
so per cent abatementâfrom eight to teVi
15 per centâabove ten, 20 per cent. '
Mr. Wilberforce thought that the abate- '
ment (hould be farther extended, as the ex
pences of children were greater from the
age of sixteen to twenty-one than at any o- '
ther period of their lives.
Mr. Pitt observed, that in all former a&s, 1
â where the diftindion of ages had been in- '
troduced, the age of fixteeu was the usual '
line of demarcationâlt was so in the poll- '
tax. '
After some further consideration, the ,
clause was brought up.
Another elaufe was proposed for exempt- !
ing boarding-schools and public houses, mak- ?
ing them fubjeft to the fame rates of afleff- 1
mentS' as (hops and lodgfhg houses. I
Mr. Baker thought they would be able,
by railing thei'r prices, to throw the bur
then upon those persons who sent their f
scholars ; and, therefore, ought to pay their r
full proportion. n
Mr. Pitt and ferjeant Adair were of a j
contrary opinion j and after some further
conversation, it was agreed to where the 3
boarders were not less than 101.
Mr. Pitt next presented the clause con- 1
taining the schedule, fpecifying the rules. n
It was a fubjeft, he said, which required c
great deliberation. He thought the bed
way would be now to bring it up, have it
printed, and go into the difcuflion upon b .
the report.
Au exsmption was moved in favor of me- "
dical gentlemen, allowing them to keep a
coach and horses in town, and two horses
in the coMntry- This clause produced a
conversation of some length.
Sir E. Knatchbull thought there was no
difference between town and country prac- u]
titioners, and that the exemption ought to
extend to them both. tl
The Attorney General was not favorable so
to the principle of general exemptions, but re
thought that the carriage of the physician T
required indulgence. It was an introduc
tion to praftice : at the fame time, there re
were so few carriages kept by country phy- ro
ficians, that the diminution of the produce
of the tax would be very inconsiderable if fe
the indulgence was extended to all of them, jo
Mr. Pitt thought the abatement of the
duty in town would be very proper, aÂ«,
perhaps, there was no perfon'would fsffer
more by a discovery of income than the can- I pa
didate for medical praftice. But he coil- ha
ceived that a carriage kept in the country ! ex
was a proof of opulence. The fame rea- an
son did not apply, to the profeffion of the ' at
v> for it was of little consequence wheth- or
er the Barrister walked down to Wedmin- th
tter-Hall, or carried bis blue bag in a hack- foi
nty-coach.
The committtee divided on an amend- :
ment proposed by Sir Ed. Knatchbull, for fa'
extending the abatement to all physicians, pr
both in country and was ne- th
gatived by 59 against 42. ,
The committc then divided otl the origtn-
F al claufeâfur it, 59, againd it* 39-
Mr. D. P. Coke proposed 4 clause, to
prohibit any fees from being taken by t e
tellers of tho exchequer on the money rait
ed by-thiÂ» Â»d. In making this motion,
he declared that he was not aSuated by any
hollile motives againil the two noble per'ons
who held this office; lie was attached to
the preftnt ministry, and the mora io, fce
:om- caufethofe who Hood forward to futeeed
them had declared for a radical reform,
re be which, in his opinion, wa4 other terms tor
mm- ra di ca l ru i n : reform in parliament, he be
and licked, mud be the forerunner of ai'evolu
cach- tion. But at a time when the country
>Â°} : â were called upon for such great exertions,
" ' ' and were to contribute so largely, he tho t
" a the uobfe persons who held the office cou.
car " have no objection to fubferfbe their pro.it a ,
Sher he was in hopes that a noble lord, son ot
one of thfcm, who was in hiu place, would
:arts r jf e an( j f CC ond his motion. In the present
emergency, he believed the noble marquis
ood, (Buckingham) would have no obje&ion to
P a T" facrifice that additional income fortbefci
-1 to vice of his country.
jf e ; Mr. Pitt f?id, he did not fujjpofe that the
lub " hon. gentleman could ait hodilely againil
noblemen who had given him no provoca
,ax tion; He gave the hod* gentleman credit
rate for that sentiment, and hoped th t he also
(hould be believed that his opposition to the
claufe was not founded in motives of pri-
P ro " vate partiality. It bfcame the house fe
:hon rioufly to consider wither they would at
â tack a freehold r*ght vetted in the noblemen,
:^ en and giver, is the reward of services, to
J S" their fathers, and which had descended to
them as absolute ptoperty. And this too
was moved jud after a elaufe empowering
r " any one to fubferibe voluÂ»tarily ; the rea'
mpt fan assigned that the hon. gentleman believ-
P er ed they could have no objeftion, if
had not, surely it would be fully as agreea
ble to them to leave them to exert that in-
H tqntioh of their own free will. He mod
complain also of the manner in which the
'P 0 son of one of the noble lords was called up
on to second the motion. It was dealing
unfairly by him, and placing him in a very
J . unpleasant situation. It was calling him
ta speak for his father without consulting
1 ' him, inducing him either ta oppose the mo
, " tion, or support it for another, without au
l.he thority.
'S* Sir Wm. Pulteney supported the motion;
! rt ' he thought it perfeftly fair, that in times
of such public distress, persons holding such
tne lucrative offices (hould not benefit*by the iri
,rV crtafed burthens laid upon tfie people.
Mr. Pitt replied, that the hon. Baronet
! n " was mistaken in the idea that the tellers of
the Exchecquer would derive any benefit
er from the imposition of this tax. They
â¢Â° would not receive any fees in cOnfequenoe
of it ; and, therefore, upon no principle of
, judice could this motion he supported.
The Solicitor General said, the object of
the learned Gentleman's motion was una-
tainable, because it was not pofiible in
â j the issuing of the public money from the
Exchecquer to ascertain whether it was mo-
I ney arising from this tax, or whether it was
; J the other revenue of the country.
Sir William Pulteney said, as this was a
te completely new measure, he saw no reason
why the money raised by this tax (hould not
be paid into the Bank, instead of the Ex
chequer.
Mr. Coke said, he would persist in bring
ing up this claule, and would take the sense
j n ' of the committee upon it. He was convin
jaj ced, that if this bill (hould ever pass the
>ll Legislature, it could not be carried into ex
ecution.
he Mr. Pitt, in reply to what had fallen from
Sir W. Pulteney, said, that if the money
was paid into the Bank, it would set aside
all the checks and guards which the Consti
tution had set over the expenditure of the
public money.
I f Mr. Dundas said, the language which had
ir! a " en from thehon. gentleman who had pro
,;r posed this clause, was highly unparliamenta
â ir ry ' bim t0 explain what he
meant by faying, " the bill could not be
a carried into execution if it was passed by the
er Legislature." Did he mean, that there was '
xe any force from one corner of the kingdom :
to the other that would resist the Legifla
n_ ture ?If he did not mean that, he ought |
s not to use general expressions, which were '
)( j capable of such dangerous conftru&ions.
; ft Mr. Addington spoke against the clause.
Mr. Coke laid, he did not mean that any
in body would resist the law, but he meant
that he believed there were numbers who 1
would not be able to comply with it.
a The committee then divided : '

have committed to the committee of claims.
This reference was opposed by the chair
man of the committee of claims (Mr. D
Foster.) He ftatrd, that colonel Raw
ought to have been, if he was not paid bv
the state of Rhode Island ; that a number
of applications of this kind had been made
to Cosgrefs, and uniformly rejefited; the
amount of these claims, he believed, would
not be less than several thousand dollars;
and the accounts of the several states
j who employed these troops had already been
, adjusted between the general government

Mr. Otis from the committee ta whom

Mr. Gallatin thought it better that the

MR. FENNO,
I am' sorry to hear that the Germantown
Turnpike bill has polled a second reading in
thefenate of this state without a single a
mendment ; if this is the cafe and the bill
should in its present shape become a law, it
will never be carried intoeffeft, for its pro
visions are such that no m3n in his senses,
will become a Ã¼bferiberâThe road is to be
extended to Reading, and if not compleat
ed in ten years is to revert to the state and
consequently all that ftiall have been expen
ded will be forfeitedâTrue it is, that gales
may be put up when the road is compleat
cd ten milet, .and if the. company caH be
reimbursed within that time, the money ex
pended thereon, there will he no lnft ; but
can it be supposed that the toll will be fuf
ficient for that purpose ?âThe people of
Montgomery county and others travelling
that road can avoid it by going one mile
round : and as new roads may be laid out
through that county so as to make that dis
tance much less, there can be 110 doubt but
measures will be taken by those who are op
posed to the Turnpike road to lead people
another direction, and thereby render this
artificial road almost entirely unproductiveâ
The company are fubjeci to so many reftric
liable to such numerous prosecu
tions, that nothing i:hl }â¢ v 1 i * l - ni "fix
ation can attend them. And as those who
it might beexpefted would be the principal
fubferibers will be fubje<?t to an enormous
toll, whilst others who will fubferibe bÂ«t lit
tle will be almost exempt, it cannot be pofii
ble that the fubfeription will 511. If thib
bill is compared with the Lancaster Turn
pike aft, it will be found that the toll on
pleafura'ole carriages will be 50 per cent
higher, and the toll upon carriages of bur
then, 30 per cent lower on the German
town than on the Lancaster road. Is this
reasonable ? Is it just ? Is is probable that
'the owners of pleafarable carriages will do
any thing to an aft so unjust in princi
ple into efFeft ?
I do not mean to censure the member of
the house of reprefentatives-who was the
warmed oppoferof this bill, for the amend
ments which he offered and which in faft
will entirely prevent it frcm being carried
into effeft. lam disposed to think that he
thought them right ; but I am sorry he
was so much mistaken ; for had he thought
as correftly upon this fubjeft as he does up
on mod others which come before the legis
lature, he might have rendered his country
an effehtial fei^ice.
It is to be hoped that the senate will a
mend the exceptionable parts of this bill
when it is read the third time ; and if that
should not be done, there can be no doubt
but it ought to receive the governor's nega
tive ; for then we might stand a goodchance
of obtaining a bttter law at the next ftf
fion of the assembly ; but if it should pass
into a law it is very doubtful whether the
legislature would make any alterations in it
in less than two years even if there was not
a single fubferiber. A CITIZEN.

MR. FENNO,
A writer in your paper of the 10th in#, after
making a Ibort quota ion from Da'jyniple, con
certiing the hiltory of England, â¢ which aflrrts that
itshiflory is that of liberty, and of its fpirirupon

bove all, upon the dignity of the national character "
As the man faid'-of Ht-rcnles; " Wbo impeached
Hercul.s ?" \\ ho impeached the Epg'ilh nation
al charader ?
The- writer appears, however, to be a very
young; nian, at .raft in historical knowledge, if
>Â» hat he has published may be aken as the result
of his Oudies. 1 here are many particulars in
which we cannot place tha most Oeady credit in tif
toriaiÂ«s ; and we know that this mod impartial Wif
tory oJ England, and the bell, that has ever been
published as far as it was perfciled, was written by
- J re <h nan, who was himfelf an adorin some of
the important tranfadions upon which he has
written; [mean Raptn de Ihoyras, Neverthe
iÂ»fs, excellent as that history is, there are particu
lars initwhichhave not received the uniform assent
of well informed msn.
But is it really true what Dalrymple dates ? I
admire as much as any man the great charaders
wl ich England has produced ; 1 admire the trial
y J u ';Â» - 1 -->Â»*-'-eas corpus ad, and general Inirir
ot liberty whichTfas DcL in that nadon
Yet, permit me to diflfent frrtm DalryiupU,
from writer who has adopted his fVntimenti.
To difputÂ« upon the principles of liberty at this
time of day would indeed be a work of supereroga
tion, as it would he the extreme of absurdity to fay
the history of England is that of liberty ; it would
hr* at heA tut a comparative history, and we should
exc.ude all antiquity, as well as the eighty years
war of the Dutch, and the noble struggle of the
Swif-, in order to pay a compliment that is not
warrantad even in itfelf.
It would be in like manner as ah(W<i to talk of
of the English constitution. Th at baft been very
tSo r oughly invefttgarÂ«d ; and would not now af
ford any very irit}ruÂ»fUve information in addition
to what is known. As to its influence upon relig
ion, I fear the history of Engl nd' is not very in
ftru&ive whether it is confiJcrfid under Henry
VIII. or Mary, James I. or George II with great
delerctice I urge it, the history is far from delight
ing to any mind of sensibility or liberality. If
wealth and power arc in therr.felves, independent
of the means by which they are acquired and (he
ends to which they are applfed, the proper and juil
objects of admiration; there I will acknowledge
t"at. I know of no nation which def rves the attcn
tion of mankind, thtre is none that merits the most
ftr <sl and minure curiosity more than England. 1
do not fay how that riches and that power have
be- n produced and employed, pcrh ps it is therein
the " dignity #f the national charader" is to be
best difccrned. If your Qprrefpor.dent would o
blige with his ideas on this further in illuf
tratiori, perhaps 1 may be mistaken as t>> his know
ledge of thefubjeA; as to the reft his observa
tions it is impoftible for us to make things bttter
in France, theyfeem blindly regardlef* of all the
wilt'em which we can them ; so let them
proceed they like, so they do not meddie witli
ouraff'irs I hope they may continue to "con
quer their own felicity," as your eorrefpondent
fays, and let us alone. I hope when your corref
pondent has paid a little regard to the history he
has written about, he will let us hear from him
fomefaÂ»sU, as they are much bnter than any Yague

law making all American vessels good prize
which should have on board papers signed
by John Adams ! ! as they view him an

to business of every kind.
ARM ! or STARVE !
The Jacobins to a man are opposed to
arming our vessels, or fitting out a finale
ship of war. They well know, that ow
ing to French gun-boat piracies, our mecha
nics and artificers are almost starving ; and
that the moment Congress gives leave to
our merchants to arm, and orders naval
yards to commence building new ships, that
they will, find full employment.âTHlS IS
FACT ! The moment the newt arrives that
the merchants shall have liberty to arm their
vessels, not an ax, hammer, or mechanic
implement will be idle. Business will afTume
its adivity ; and the rnufic of the cunning
workman will be heard on all our wharves.

COMMUNICATION.
Whatever delusions, the iuftpufiog afpe<S
of the French revolution, in its early.fta
gei, may have produced, the condudl of
the dire&ory will now admit of but Â«ne in
terpretation ; .and all the fine spun, flatter
ing theories of liberty, equality and the
rights, of man, have terminated in one of
the most flagitious, lawltfi dominations,
that ever the human race was doomed to
groan under. But the usurpers are Readily
advancing to their ruin, in the fame steps
of all their predecefTors in violence and out
rage. Peace, which is ever the bane of ty
rants, they'dread of all things, and there
fore war must be carried on, 3s long as any
pretext can be found for its continuance, or
any plunder remains to feed the rapacious
appetites of the soldiery.
Their objeft now, it seems, is to carry
the blessings of liberty and equality into
England, in which the tyrants very artful
ly avail themselves of tke national sentiment
of rivalry and hatred Jo that country. A
sentiment, so ardently glowing in the hearts
of Frenchmen, that not even the horrors

guish it 5 and which the aristocrat, who

This is probably the best scheme "they could
have fallen upon, to blind the people to their
outrages, and to gild the nefarious measures
of their government. Their armies too,
must be employed at all events, as lcifure
might be dangerous, and fugged to them
the sacrilegious idea of turning their aftns

fureof, and that is, that we Anglo- Ameri

than the English themselves, and that if
their abilities are but equal to their inclina
