I Ephraim K. Wilson, member from Worcefler,
I andficondtd by Mr. P. B. Key, member from

7 a JOHN ADAMS,
I Presibknt tf the United States.
I
I THE General Aflembly of the State of
Maryland, compol'ed of chararfiera feledled by
I the various clalTei cf its citizens, and pofleffed
I of a full knowledge of the sentiments of their
I constituent*, would, in this interesting criGs of
I public afiairs, dp little justice to their feelings,
I the interest of their country, and to your virtue,
in for(tearing to express an entire and cwrdial ap'-
probation of the firm, temperate and dignifhd r ..
I measures of your Lift
I Called to the Prefideney of the general gov-
I ernment, at a moment when the aspiring and
. I venal rulers of France convulsed all Europe with K
a war prosecuted forplunder and aggrandifemsjit Mr.
lit was not difficult to forcfee, that every species -j',
of artifice and intrigue which talents could fug-
I geft, ambition excite, or avarice inflame, would
joÂ» employed to disturb our happiness and peace tenai
I to cajole or force our country into a war preju- bell,
I dicial to our interests, and to render your ad- Mefl
ministration painful, perplexing, and, if poffi. men
I ble, odious to the people.
Thedeftruflion of religion, and encourage- la
ment of loefÂ» principles, were eminently calcu
lated to create fit instruments for promoting di-
I visions in, and paralizing the energies of, other mar ' l
governmentsâ%cnce the 'inremitting, dark and
inGdious exertions, prarftifed to divide us at K
home, whilst a lawless, vexatious and predate- seam
I ry war, plundered us abroad.
To prevent the repetition of aggressions not c
more flagitious than destitute of colourable pre- 0 . m
J text, and to recal the government of France to n
j an honorable fulfilment of its political eogage
! menti in the true Ipirit of flncere amity, we K
have seen, with pride and pleasure, your ample, Mr
just, and pacific inflruftions to our ministers to ma rii
demand reparation in the accustomed forms of w
diplomatic negotiation ; instead of the diredo
ry's meeting these amicable overtures, with pain ' 0
. and indignation we have beheld insults heaped maft<
. 00 '"juriesâou? ministers spurned with indigni- fines,
; I tyâour country threatened with the fate of go-
I verliments wantonly annihilatedâand eur citi- Ki
I zeni treated as vassals and Daves, whs must base- vj
, ly purchase the privilege Â«f Hating their com- I/v V
j plaints. Condudl like this has torn the veil 9 le
I from the face of hypocrisy, and awakened the
I people of America from the delirium of unfuf-
I petting friendinp to rally round the government W
jof '.heir adoption. We have seen with fititfac* giinn
j tion the annulment of a treaty, violated as of-
I tenastheinterelt of individuals, or the caprice Ki
|of a moment dilated ; and we heartily approve w
I of the protective measures. of our government,
j as well as the late regulations for internal quiet!
J Preparation for war is preservation of peace. Ki
Having emancipated ourselves from Britain, Wi
and secured our liberties by one revolution, we <
pledge ourselves not to facrifice the bleffines at Kii
the flirine of France, and we will stand prcpar
ed to encounter her open hostilities, or counter- ,
a<3 her yet more dangerous principles and in- ~
trigwes ; nor will we fuffer ourselves to be lulled i '
' v IIUo * fÂ» l *' fecutity by the fcjcblaau of cooqil.'
*'- iatory languÂ»ge or racafurea, the rcfult of per
haps mlidio'js policy. We will support the gov
ernment of our choice, preserve our indepen
_ dence and our riglvs, orperilh in the attempt.
But we fondly trust, that f : long as the enjoy
ment of rational l.btrt* i> feeured, virtue and
I religion inculcated and praifhfetl, tuhile the go,
3- vernment continue true to the people, and the
people to them/elves, we may defy the aflaults of
any power on earthy and look forward, under ,
the proteflion of Heaver), to a continuance of i
the prosperity and happiness of our country.
NA. Adulation disgraces freemen, but the frank' 1
and undisguised expreflian of public fentimsnt
J is the moll honorable reward an enlightened
98. 1 statesman can receive. Accept, then, Sir, our t
Pre- aflnrances in behalf of the people of Maryland (
that the wife and salutary principles of your ad-"
ministration inlpire preient confidence ; and a
f Sa* retr Â°fpe<ftive view of your part long and faith
t| â¢ ful services, your Heady patriotism and well
! tried integrity, conttitutes an ample pledge for
their the future reflitnde of your condudl ; and with t
your wilhes for your health end happiness. we ear- Ii
fpedl neftly hope your ufefulnels will be long contin- n

troop. â  bj
The Standard is painted on a light blue 30
Â» ornamented with silver fringe. The VÂ£
United States is represented by a fine, muf- d 3
cular, bald Eagle. The countenance of the to
Eatfle, firm, animated ar.d indignant ; its bl
attitude and the etcblems that accompany an
~ it are iiidicvilive of ll.c present situation and j
feelings of rnr country. The Eagle, with '
- its wings fulty expanded, is just rift"g to- j
wards fixtecti filvsr star. In one ulon he
bears a g-lden Itield, on which are inferib- 1 ]
ed the arms of the Uuitrd Stales. Fram ! 1
behind the [h'uli there appears, borne in the ; I
fame talon, an olive btanth. The other ta- I
â f- lon is Just grasping a sword, which, to- i
gether with a trumpet lies in a group with \
a I'otfeman's cap similar to that worn by i
the-roop The mr.-'.to, sv# ciypeo. pax i
id t6ta, flows in an easy label from the beak 1
re of the Eagle. It is endeavored on this
111 Stardard to recreftnt an important politi
te cal truth often rÂ«commendeÂ«J by our great

The following mods is proposed, at leajly as ra~ h
rS > ttonal, to prevent the importation and c
11 " ation of the Telhw Fever in the city of c
a Philadelphia. o
j I ft. With regard to the f&rmer, applica- I
tion should be made to the general govern
. ment to prohibit by law any i tercourL- with ' C
j s the Weft India islands during the months f
June, Jill/ and August, as long as the | tl
, e present war in Eur jpe continues, provided
nevertheless, that in cafe any person should
import goods from the said islands during
q the term afsrefaid he should be compelled , n ,
to dilcharge his whole cargo and fumigate I v
. the fame for 40 days in a proper Lazaretto o:
j be erefted, for that-purpofej; that the vef-
0 fel (hould also be cleansed and fumigated ; r,
j that the crew and pafTcngers on board of
vefTels importing goods as afor said from' k ,
laid iflandu should perform a quarantine ps
s 40 days ; that at the expirarioq thereof, and ca
: not sooner. the goods should be removed to T
' the refpedtive cities and town* to wliich they
e w(re destined in lighters, to be provided Si
1, fÂ°. r 'bat purpose ; âand finally, that any
master of a veflel, merchant, or other person (?
.-omitting a breach of thete regulations in ~
whole or in part, so as to introduce the of
s Yellow Eever, (hould fuffer exemplary pun
iikment.
2d. With regard to the latter, tH legi!-
hture 01 this state fhnuld be applied to at C!
their enfuin j feflion to pass a law to enable C
the Canal Company to purchase Messrs. Ci
Robi foil's Mills on the Wiffahieken Creek,' p:
in order that the waters of the said Creek Â«
-gay be fought the pr-sent bl
! . Canal to wash and cltatife the streets of Phi- fc
ladelphia, and to ftippiy it with frefh and
|f wholesome water for culinary purposes and cl
r for extinguifhiag fire. '"That this may be F
d rifftded with great facility, by raising the ar
1 present, data or dims over the Wiffah.cken, "X 1
e a few feet higher, cannot be coniefted \ sui ; to
as the Catnd -is already dug out more than
|ths of thr dilhoce at least, of the sum a '
already expended on the Canal betwe-n the h<
city and the falls would coiyipleat it-to be
- mills. It is therefore reasonable to conclu.de,
t that au mode more eligible or less expenfitre w
t can be adjipted.' And indeed if the legifla- !f"
e ture (hould agiec as has been the cafe with ty
1 regard to another institution, to t&ke ihares j
1 in the t_anal Company with a view of for- lat
r warding [q ufeful and necefTary an ui dertak- â  j e '
- ing there can be no doubt but that the j?a
state would derive a large and permanent PI
profit from a participation in such stock.
Stockholders in Europe of all Canal,s calcu
lated either for the purposes of commerce,
or a supply of frefh water have never failed
to make a most ample provision for their
1 families by the proceeds of such inflitutions
r âand in London and other large cities, a"
â¢ cubic inch of frefh-water far family use,
Condu'tcd by a pipe into a kitchen or a tlo
"' amber hath ever produced the most incred- Â°"
iblt rent. The city nntwithftanding its
' long boasted cleantinefs, has perhaps be- C Â°
1 1 .line as dirty, and confequeqt y unwhole
fame, as any in the Universe. A stranger Clt
... pafiiag ,1 ,ng D.ick-ftreet aad many other V Â°
places in the city where the mouth* of the 031
mmon sewers open, a-?d like Pandora's
Box of old, diTgorge a compound of the

p .ft he was the bottom of the Temple V

(nape his courfr towards any of the narrow
lanes or rather flairs which lead through the
bank fide f From into Water-street,' he .
would hink himfslf seized by the ruthless p'
fangs of the Telloiu Fever.
To prevent then these noifom; smells in
f uturÂ«, the common sewers fheuld be arched
over, the ternpks in Front-ltreet ftridly in
fpeiied and regtrlnted by law, the streets so
regulated that all water (hould be discharged ~"
into the oae river or* the other on the fur
face alone, a:'d finally, that the whole city
should occasionally be covered over with F
pure water from a iaige bason, to be ereft
ed for the purpose at the interferon of
Broad and Market streets, to be supplied
by the said canal. Another very efTential
and important thing must be dot:e to pre .
vent the continuation bf this unhappy mala- Â°lei
