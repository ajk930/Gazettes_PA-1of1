From the NÂ»w-York Daily Gazette.
Ido not suppose it necessary (fays a eorrefpord
ent, who calls himfelt an enemy oj Foreign Influence)
to apologize for troubling you with the following
Extracts, translated from a history of the Ameri.
can war, written in French, by M. Milliard D'Au
berreuil, publilhed in 178 a, and fold at Paiii un
der the eye of the government. Of their authen
ticity no doubt will be entertained, if we consider
that the freedom of press was unknown in
France at the time of publication, and and fevcral
years after it. The free circulation of the work is
therefore an obvious proof of their genuinenessâlt
involves a virtual acknowledgement of the hiltorians
veracity as far, at least, as relate* to the motives of
the Court, and the fentihients of the people.
"Theagents of the United States at the Courts
of France and Spain, gained credit and confe
quense in propoition as the American arms were
vidWious. The agitation of the Courts became
general. Their sole object was to depress Eng.
land, and reduce her to a power of the second or
der in the political hierarchy of Europe. The
People of France recolle&ed the national indigni
ties and misfortunes which preceded the peace ot
1763. They evinced an ardent thirit far war, and
were impelled with a strong difirc of revenge. The
fame spirit situated the Court.
" Lord Stormont, the English A mbaffador com
plained of the indulgence experienced by the Amer
icans in French ports. He ds-wanded that orders
should be issued prohibiting the sale of arms and am-
Munition to the rebelsâthat the American priva
teers fliould not be permitted to fell their prizesâ
that they should be treated as pirates and iuterdift
ed the ports. These demands were admittedâThe
royal orders, issued in consequence of them, were
so rigidly executed that feverral Americans, wlio
â¢wijhed to infringe them, were seized and purilhed,
notwithstanding the reprefeotations of the Agents
of Congrels, who transmitted the intelligence to
America, where an advantageoMs, connexion was
generally despaired of.
" Matters were in this lituation when the - news
of Burgoyne's capture arrived, and fsddenly chang
ed the whole afpeÂ£t of affairs. O. Britain evinced
a desire to accommodate the exffting differences with
America upon the best terms she could. "We
rauH cease, it was fa id. to be the dtipes of France
âwe must unite with America to reduce the pow
er of our ancient enemy, who is the original caujt
of our quarrel "
" It was then that France saw no time fliould be
loft. It was high time for Louis to anticipate the
designs of his enemy The interejl of his people as
well as his own glory were committed, and nothing
more was neeejfary to determine him to take into
corfideration the overtures of Congress.
" Accordingly, 00 the 16th ot December, 1777,
Mr. Gerard, secretary of the Council of State,
waited on the Ameratcan Awbaffadois and told
them by order of the King, that after long and ma
ture deliberation, it wsi decided to treat with them
as the representatives of an independent people ;
that it was obviously the iutereft of France to curtail
the power of England by disuniting America from
her ; that the King would not infill on America's
refuting a peace with England if advantageous pro
posals were offered ; but that the only condition
required, and on which he calculated, was, that
no treaty fliould be made with England in which
the United States renounced their independence,
and acknowledged allegiance to that government.â
The treaty-was concluded Feb. 6, 1778." Thus
far the extratl.
The following remarks are not unapplicable.â¢
" The Americans gained credit in France only
in proportion as their arms became viftÂ®rions"â
that is, while they were unfuccefsful, the fcala of
French favour turned the ether way. France
would not meddle in a doubtful quarrel. Nothing
could be done for us in the dark year of 1776.
Eighteen months elapsed after the declaration of
Independence, before it was thought prudent to
come forward ; and then m soon as news of Bor--
goyne's fall reached Versaillesâthe moment we
were thought able to effect the business without
aid, in steps France !
We have been told a thousand times, that we
are, and eternally will be, deep in debt on the icore
of gratitude. From fejfifh principle France en
gaged in the warâso at least fays the historian.â
" The object was to depress England, and reduce
her to a power of thefecond order in the politiAl,
hierarchy of Europe.'> Here then i$ the original
(ourfc of our gratitudeâlt seems very small indeed
âOur Democrats, however thinkotherwifeâThey
know better than the historian who declares, " the
f rencb people recollected the national indignities
which preceded the peace of 1763 âthey evinced
an ardent thirfl for war, and were impelled by a
strong desire of revenge,"âNo, fays the " Patri
â¢ts," it was not thatâit was from a more magnan
imous principleâit was purely from her love to the
United States, that she commenced hoftilitics.
Though our privateers were pursued wiih as much
acrimony in Franceas they could have beeÃ in Eng
land, in wsÃ nothingâit happened only during I
that long period when, to u(e the words of Mr.
Gerard, they were maturely deliberating whether
to aid us for their own intcreft, or to alfift England
in repressing a spirit of refiftanee which is was ap
prehended might pervade their own coloniesâFin
ally, however, they decided ; and the grand con
dition, without which nothing courd be stipulated,
was, that America should never renounce her In
dependence. Indeed there was no great danger
of it.
The fact is, had the United States been expuÃg
ed from the Universe, it would have been no real
fubjeft of regret to Frenchmen, provided any eith
er means of reducing England to a fecendary rank
in the qolitical hierarchy of Europe had presented,
in order to raise France to the firft. In short the
whole bufineU from the beginning, the long and
mature deliberations, the final option aÂ»d subsequent
.measuresâall were ultimately decidcd ob the prin
ciple of national intereil and revenge; And here
we have the fyftcm Â«f our Â«blijjations concentered
to a point. \

COMMUNICA 7 lONS.
Mr. Fenno,
IN looking over your pjper of Saturday last, I
observed that ene of Mr. Adet's complaints against i
the geyctHment of the United States, was the per- \
mining of the makers as almanacks tp print the :
name ot the BntiOi Minifttr before that of the
Plenipotentiary of the Terrible Republic.
This closed a lang lift of grievances, and as it was
the last i fuppofc was intended as the raoft impor
tant.
With considerable efforts of patience I had wa
ded through impudent and base attacks upon
the honor as our country, were answered with
the mod exemplary coolness and temper by our ex
ecutive, but at reading this molt ridiculous of all
psffibly ridiculous complaints, I could not refrain
from laughterâand I fuppefe if I had been placed
on the guillotine with the poor makers as almanacks
who committed the affence, it would have been the
fame thing.' If a minister of the United States
was ta offer such an objection in the name of our
country to a foreign nation, I (hould vote for his
recal, not that the liner (hould use his axe but his
rods, not to take off his head but to birch his bot
tom. It is to be sure a pleasant fight to behold the
Terrible Republic and her Tertible Mimllei,
mousing at almanacks and the printers of six
penny publications.
Mefftg. Ganet, Fauehet and Adet, have gradu
ally improved upon each other in their complaints.
The next agent of the Terrible Republic will
1 suppose date thenuMEÃi, h irn books and gin-
GERBREAD'ALPHABtTs of oui children, as openly
menacing herdignity. Our alphabet still Â«enveys,
it mult be confeffed many veiy ami publican ideas.
The letter E which stands for England, precedes
the letter F which is the initial of Fiance, and
what is ft ill more dreadful and alarming, and per
fectly LIBERTICIBE in its nature, K which (lands
for King sr Kingdom, takes ptecedence by at lealt
fix letters of R the 'very firjl letter of the word
REPUBLIC. x CITIZEN.
P. S. I hope far God's fake Mr. Fenmi, if you
publish this, you will take fume efficacious
means to prevent it from coming to the eyes of the
Minister or Direftoryof the Terrible Republic
An attack from the French Aurora was to have
beerr expected upon the President on accoum of his
late valuable communication to Congress. The
Aurara thinks it is of an irritating tendency. In
fact the present temper of the nation, who have felt
more indignation than fear, refpe&ing the insolence
as demand contained in x M. Adet's nates, is in itfelf
a mcjl irritating thing, no doubt, to those whoex
pefted very different effe&i from M. Adet's appeal
to the people. In this appeal he brought forward
eimplaints which Genet and Fauehet had worn out,
and at which the people had silently laughed He
abused the Executive, and the two Houses of Con
gressâhe hurled the charge of peifidy fully in the
teeth of the government of this countryânot in an
official manner, but through the medium of the
papeis. To this insidious attempt to rouse the
people in his cause, there could be no anfwet to M.
Adetâbath becaufehe was precisely in the Ration
which Genet took, to whom no answer could be
givenâand bccaufe by a hfpenfion of his futtftions
as minister, he was no longer in a capacity to re
ceivecommunications from the President. M. Adet
made choice as this mode of attaining his
the repeal of certain lawsâthe rcverfal of certain
judicial decifiorsâand the annulling of the Britilh
treaty. The Executive had, it is true, been an
ticipated by the good sense of the people, in the
judgment which it became the nation to pass upon
this waÃton violation as decency and of the fore-
I re, S n ty { yet surely M. Adet can have no reason to
complain, if after the President has communicated
his opinions upon this conduct and these 9omplaints
to Congress, Congress think proper to publilh the
whole of the communications, that their condim
ents, after having heard immediately from M. Adet,
hisjlatement of the cafe, may also hear the other fide.
It is not only an answer to M. Adet's complaints,
(hewing then perfectly groundless, but also a vitidi.
cat ion of a government to its condiments, to whom ,
it it reponfiblc for the fccuiity of national honor i
' fair conduct, ard the impartial cxecinion of its
treaties : doubtless <ts the vi -dicauon is complete,
it will irritate those to whom Jilence, though fome
tirnes complained of, would on this occation have
been very pleasing ; though certainly it could never
have been juftified to the people, \Â»ho three month*

r EDENTON, January I z.
Address of the legifiature of the ftnte of North-
Carolina, to his excellency George Washington,
Esq. President of the United States.
The general assembly of North-Carolina, apprised
of your intention to retire from office, feel it a duty
for themselves and their constituents, to express the
t high sense they entertain of the vast advantages de
rived from your exertions, to the-caufe of the free
dom of America, and of mankind. To secure the
â  national bleflings ef peace and independence, to
rescue a people from slavery on the one hand, and
to guard them from anarchy and faction on thp
other, are the great objefls to which your effoiii
have been long, and fuccefsfully dire&cd, amidst
the perils of war and the cares of government, in
the most difficult, exalted and important Rations.
You have finifhed the taffc, and have amply dis
charged every claim of your country, to your fer
-1 vices and talents. We regret, however, that, your
fiim and experienced hand should, at thisjwnfit'ure,
! be withdrawn from the helm of affairs, after
you have devoted thebeft of your days to our felici.
ty, it ill becomes us '.o complain of a step, which
is necessary to your own. We therefore sincerely
1 congratulate you on the near profpefts of your re
turn to the leisure ef retirement arid the tranquility
of private life, which the voice and the diltrffesof
yoHr country fiift tempted you to foifake*
We consider your last address as,baving added to
the proofs of your patriotism, and to ihe debt of
gratitude and veneration, which we previously owed
you. It takes an affeSioilate and parental leave of
your fellow-citizens, its councils are dilated by
the deepest political wisdom, and its sentiments flow
from a heart replete with solicitude foi the welfare
of its country. And well may you be iaterefted in
I the happiness of a people, whose fate has long oeen
connected with your own, and in whose toils and
! perils, success and glory, you have so largely
(hared. , ' '
As to ourselves we devoutly wi(h that you may
long live to fee and to enjoy that na'ional profpr.ity
far which America is so much indebted to yÂ«ur
ex-ertione. Retired from office, and di .tL of
pc.wer, you will Hill reign in the hearts ol your
fellow-citirens, and continue to receive a tribute of
applause from a grateful nation.

Mr. Dwight ivdter, from the committee of claim ,
made a report on the petition of William Alexander,

petitioner. It was referred to a committee of the

Mr. Swanwick, from the committee of commerce

Richard R. Saltouftall, J;ieob Broom, Robert Dawfon,
William Crawley Jordan, John Nieholfon, and the
proprietors ol the glass irAnufcidlory of Boston, and
lundry hat manufacturers in the United States.

cornpenfation lor his expencet. the committee re
ported that a court ot law was the proper tribunal for
anappeal, and refolvtd that the prayer of the petition

Jacob Broom is the proprietor of a cotton mill on
Brandy wine cieek. He prays that the duty on raw
â¢otton may be repealed, and that an additional duty
may be laid on cotton goods imported.âThe commit
tee report, that to repeal the duty on raw cotton im

William Crawley Jordan is a silk manufacturer, who
is delirous of eliablifhing a (ilk manufatflory in this

addition to his capital. Ihe committee reported, that
if our finances were in a ltate to encoarage a scheme

also d'figreed So.
John Nieholfon, of this ci'.y, and the proprietors of
the glass manufactory at Boston, pray their manufac
tories may be encouraged by an additional duty on
glass i piported. The committee report it as their opi-
high price of labor, which time only
coultrcure, was a greater obftaele to their manufactory
than the duty, and that there (ore the prayer
petitioners paght not to be granted.

and it wis of o.urfe difagieed to
The reports were twice read, and the house concur
red in them.
Mr. W. Smith called for the order of the day on
the report of the committee of ways and means, to
whom it was referred to take into confederation the
fubjeCf cis- further revenue*, and the provitons requi
site for improving and more effectually fceuring the
internal revenues, which being agreed to, the house
resolved itfelf into a committee ot the whole, and the
following resolution was brought under consideration :
â¢' Resolved, that it mill be expedient to abolilb the
tax laid on spirits distilled from materials of the growth
.or produ.c of the United State*, at any other place
than a city, town or village, at which there shall be
one Â«r more Kills, which, fiugly, it only one, or to
gether, if more than one, (hall be of less tapaaity than
four hundred gallons ; and to colleCt this branch of
the revenue from a tax on t.he capacity of the flills."
Mr. Macon said, it appeared to him that this pro-
Yifion would havs the effeCt to destroy all the small
stills in the country, ond to establish large distilleries.
In the country, where fruit was generally distilled,
this would be a great inconvenience, as it was neces
sary to be dene immediately. He believed the system
was going on pretty well at present, and he thought
it unneccfiary to make any change in it.
Mr. Hcndcrfon hoped the resolution before them
would not be agreed to. He believed it would operate
< against many o( the small stills. Perhaps, indeed,
this was the meaning of it; for, if he remembered
r.ghtly, a gentleman from South-Carolina ( Mr. Har
per) on a former ocCalion, had expreded a wi(h that
(mall stills might be annihilated, and large distilleries
erected. With respeCt to New-Jersey, Mr H. said,
the article i>f cyder was mostly distilled. ~Jt was diffi
cult to carsy this to a distance, and therefore the nnm
bet- of small stills was very confidei able ; but, should
this refoiutioa be carried, it would fabjeCt them to
great difficulties, and, in many instanceS, amount to
a prohibition from distilling at all. He believed the
fyftitn at present was pretty generally fatiifaCtory.
NV. Calbiin (aid both .the gentleman from North-fSroll
na and from N w-J>*rfey. seemed to be certain that the plan
prop >fed would have the ess & to destroy final! Hills, and
from thence derived therr objections to it. He wtfhed they
Ibew how this ould b? done. He believed the law
might lo be carried into eftefi, but he also believat that it
might be so artanged as to avoid it
Gintlrmeu had laid that the present fyilem wis very well.
He would fay it was not so. ft was unproductive. Theex
penfe of collection upon that part of the Revenue which was
drawn from Ipiuts distilled in the country on domeltic ma
terials et.ft from 32 to 33 percent colle&i g. What the net
amount ot the duty was, he did not recollect ; he beiiev d
it was from to 209,030 dollars per annum* It was
clear, he said, that the moment a direct tax was laid upon the
Itil: inttead of the foirits, two thirds of the expense of col
lection would be got.nd of; all that was neceflary being, to
meaiurethe ltill, instead of having an officer to watch the o
peratioris oh the diltiller. H re, he (aid, fraitd* could not
be ' afily commftcd. Nothing was ueceflarv to be known
hut whether a matKdiftil led or not ; if h, distilled without a
licence, he would he liab e to a penalty, and this was all the
, fraud which could he pra&ifed
Another great objeÂ£tion to the present fyltem, Mr.G. said,
was. that it gave g'ea advantages (o the unfair trader over
him who traded fairly, Some wste advantaged through ig
norance, and some through deflgu ; an oath, he said, would
bind fomemen, but not all. This wouH be altogether pre
vented by the.plan proposed.âEvery (nan would stand upon
the fame gt und
li was true, and it was the only objection that could be
made to it, that it an equal tax was laid upon the capacities
ol all stills, there would be an advantage in favor of large
(tills: beeaufe upon larre stills, large capitals would be em
ployed, and they womld be wo>lced throughout the whole
year ; but. in order toremme this objection, he thought a
certain scale (hould be formed, in order to proportion the
duty according to the lire of .the (till He was of opinion,
that this single provision would remove all objections. If
the resolution was agrred to it would of course be referred
back, to bring in a biil, and then it would be fren whether
this evil could riot" be remedied in the wav mentioned. All
the revenue officers, Mr. G. said, were agreed as to the pro-
of thismeafure

" Our late harvest of Wheat, has proved very
scanty, much less than last yearj and in corife
quirnce, I am of opinion, we shall tequire a good
deal of foreign supplies this winter and next fpting,
when of course the price null rife in proportion
to our wants. This event must also enhance the
value of si ur ere long. At present, American
Wheat would fetch here from 62 to 64 is per fa

" Rice has become very scarce of late, and
been fold these few d ys pall at the fine price of
9 I 2to 10 dollatsper quintal; but .owards the
evd of the year, and lent time, I think it will be
worth even more.
Notwithltanding the many cargoes of staves arri

have been bought up at 140 to 150 dollars per long
houfand on board, as in quality, for the the
hogshead and barrel staves in proportion, even so
â¢ igh as 70 dollars have been paid for the latter, the
exportation of our win* in qr. caflcs being vctycon
fiderable, and said prices all likely te be supported
the demand being very great throughout the kiug

" Your whit# beans are worth here at present
from 8 to 9 dollars per fa k of 200lbs. on btiard,

it may answer here, towarlo Chrillmas, when it

the French had made a sortie with a fupeiior force,
chiefly of cavalry, upon the weakest advanced pnfts
of the Auftrians, near Neumuhl, and had drove
them back at feme distance, whereby some lives
were loft on both fides, whereupon the French bad

That the imperialists were making the most
vigorous preparations to bombard Huningen, and
to demolish all the fortifications at that place
That the Auftrians had approached so near to
Kehl withthsir batteries as not only to-fire into the
town, but alfointo the fortifications of the bridge
and on the bridge itfelf j and that the inhabitants
of Kehl had received orders to remove with their
effects tÂ» Stmftjurg, as that place would be demol
i!hedâThat the head-quarers of the arch-duke
Charles were at OffenbergâThat it was reported
a cejfation ef arms was about to take place between
â¢the imperialists and French, on the' Rhine, that
during the armistice a treaty of peace would be set on
foot, and that a nimber of couriers were going
backwards and forwards between Paris and Vienna.

do not hditateto reduce the price of a Pit ticket to seven

it is not to be cqncealed, however, that in making this

provements, are'feveral lots, in a highftate of cultivation,
and well set with red clover and orchard grass, from
which three heavy erops of hay are taken every year. Ad
jacent thereto are two large and flourifhing orchards ; one
of well chosen peach trees, the other of apple and pear,
trees, fele&edfrom the belt nurseries in the state. Pro
perly detached from the mansion house are extensive
roomy office* of every denomination, viz. a Kitchen and
Larder, house-keeper's room and Laundry, with a cellar
underneath for a variety of purposes, a store-bouse and
smoke house all of brick, a dairy and spring house of stone.
Stables for thirty horfesy and coaeh houses for four car
riages. Also a large and well planned farm yard, v ith
barn and granary, a cow house, with separate stalls for
thirty-fix grown cattle; apartments for fattening veals,
muttons anu lambs ; extensive sheds for Iheep, and other
arrangements for stock of every description, with a large
and convenient receptable for provender, from which they
can be furnifhed without being exposed to the inclemency
of the weather. An overseer's house, blacksmith's shop,
and quarters fufficient to accommodate in the best man
ner more than fifty labourers.
The arable lands are fÂ« advantageously divided as to af
ford an opportunity of making a large quantity of Indian
corn annually, without bringing the field into similar cul
ture oftner than once in four years; consequently the
'lands may be improved by keeping up the inclofures during
the intermediate years, or may be beneficially fallowed for
wheat and other grain at the option of the proprietor.
On *he prcmifes there is also a merchawt mill with one
pair of best French burr i tones, and one pair of Cologne ;
furnifhed with modern machinery, and now leafed for the
unexpired term ol four years, at 1501 per annum, and all
grain for the use of the farm, hopper free, which is near
ly iool. more. The mill and miller'shoufe are built of
free stone, within a very fraall distance of navigation,near
to which are two or more valuable fisheries, and a well
accuftome<J ferry ever the Rappahannock to the town of
Frederickfburg. The land co n tain- inexhaustible quarries
of free stone near to the river, is plentifully supplied with
remarkable fine water and pofTeffes a due proportion of
meadow, which by having the command of water may
be considerably increased. The roads are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel and sociable. In fa&, exclusive of
an improveable and well conditioned farm, the value and
emolument inseparably conne&ed witn a mill, ferries,
fiflieries and quarries eligibly situated ; the profits arising
from an ice-house inferior to none in the state, and a gar
den of four acres so abundantly stocked with vegetables
ofÂ£all forts as to Jbe fully equal to the demand in market,
th-re might be detailed many other advantages,
[ taining to the fertility of these lands, which the fubferiber
conceives it unnecessary to mention, being fully convinced
that when examined, it will be found to be a complete,
pleasant and healthy residence, po fie fling beauties and'
conveniences fufficient to attra<ft the attention of any per
son defirousof becoming a purchal'fer.
| The motive which induces the fubferiber to offer for
sale an estate so Angularly beautiful and advantageous, is
a desire to become an inhabitant of Alexandria, where he
can with more ease attend to his interests in the neigh
bourhood of that /city.
The purchaser may foe accommodated with a few slaves
in families, either for plantation or domestic use. A part
of the purchafc money will be required and the balance
made easy, the debt being properly secured.

AN ENQUIRY
Concerning Political Justice,
And its Influence on Morals and Happiness,
By William Godwin.
THE reputation of this work is already well efta*
blifhed in Europeâlt is hardly necefTary for an Ame
rican editor to fay more than barely to mention, that
the Enquiry concerning Political Justice has ever
since its publication been a favorite performance' with
the friends of republican government. The fti'e is
pure, nervous, and claflical; the ideas are strongly
marked by an or iginal vein of thinking ; and, amongst
a multitude of other just and striking paflages, the
author's delineation of the peculiar infelicities insepa
rable from the condition of a King, may be pointed
out as a most mafterlv specimen of philosophical drf
quifition. Ihe latest London edition of this work
fells in this city at fouc dollars and an half.

TO THE PUBLIC.
JA MES CAREY, No. 83, North Second Street, and
JOHN MARKLAND, No. 91, South Front Street,
Printers, have entered into partfierihip, under the firm of
Carey & Mark/and,
for the purpose of publishing an Evening in
this City, under thetitle of
The Daily Advertiser,
The firil number of which will appear on WEDNES
DAY the firft of MARCH next.
PROSPECTUS of the WORK.
I. Besides the usual selection ot intelligence, foreign
aad domdlic, The DAILY ADVERTISER will be en
riched with such other articles as may tend to the im
provement and extension of our commerce, agriculture,
manufactures, arts and fcienees, &C &c. nor lhall tha
less profitable, though highly pleaiing wallts of poute
literature, be wholly unfrequented ; as its pages will
occasionally be variegated and enliv ned from the stores
ef history, travel, biography, anecdote, &<*. as well as
the lighter effufions of sentiment, wit, humour, and
pleasantry, in prose and verse
11. The DAILY ADVERTISER will be open for
candid and liberal dilcuflion, oa both fides of every po
litical question which may interefl the public mind. It
will likewise contain such extra&s from party papers and
pamphlets, on t?oth {ides, as mayferve to develop the
plans and condaÂ«sfc cf eachâThis part of the general dc
lign, should it even fail of effecting its jJrime object, that
ot lessening the fervor of political zeal, will, at least,
diileminate that general knowledge of the bed interefls
of society and the public weal, so eflential to every citi
zen of a free and enlightened country.
111. The DAILY ADVERTISER will contain a full
and regularly digested MARINE LIST formed upon the*
plan of the London LLOYD's LIST, and a varie yof o
ther commercial intelligence; so that the menantile read
er may obtain at a fiÂ»gle glance that information which
he has hitherto been obliged, and often in vain, to seek
thro'a large confufed mass of miscellaneous matter.
IV. The pagqsVif this paper will be numbered, and the
Subscribers furnifhed yearly, with A COMPLETE AND
COPIOUS INDEX.âThis part of the plan, which will
be faithfully executed, must render a volume of thefa
papers of more ( value than the original fubfeription.
Thus have the Editors briefly fkerehed out the LEAD
ING FEA TURKS \yhich shall mark their intended pub
lication, to which they solicit a {hare of that publi# pa
tronage and encouragement without which the most ju
dicious plan and,the greatest exertions must become e
qually abortive and unprofitable.
To deserve that support which they now solicit, they
will leave nothing uneffayed which may be compared by
the most unremitted industry and liberal expenditure.
CONDITIONS OF PUBLICATION.
Is. The DAILY ADVERTISER will be neatly and
corre&ly printed in Folio, on fine royal paper and with
new types. It will be diitributed every day (Sunday
excepted) at the usual hour in the evening.
The annual subscription wiil be only fix dollarsâ
the firft hall years fubfeription to be paid on fubferibing
or in three months from the commencement of the paper.
Afterwards to be paid half yearly in advance.
I, \ DVERI ISEMENTS w iH bÂ« conspicuously displayed,
carefully corrected, andinfertcd upon moderate terms.
Until the editers Â«an procure a convenient central
situation to consolidate their business, they will receive
fublcriptionsand advertisements at their refpedtive houfei
No. 83, N- Second-Jireet, and No. 91, S. Front-street,
from the latter of which the paper will be published.
N. B, They will ifTue an AVANT COURIER of
thefige, type, paper , and plan of the Daily Advertiser,
a week or ten 'days before the publication of the nrft
number, which will be gratis, to enable the
public to form a decided opinion 011 the merits of the
undertaking.
