\VOLVME XIII.
CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, May 16.
(Continued from Saturday's' Gazette.)
Mr. Sitgreaves believed that much time
would not be necessary to rtiew that the ar
guments of his colleague arc not only falla
cious, when feparateiy considered, but that
they are at war with each other. At one
time he raises constitutional doubts, and jus
tifies them on the preemption that these vo
lunteer corps are to be considered as militia ;
and in anotlier part of his argttmtnr he conli
ders them as dangerous, because they will
form a flanding army, and a standing army of
the worst kind. Thus, changing his princi
ples to suit his purpose, he finds it equally
easy to prove thenvone thing, or the other, or
both, or neither. To arguments, such as
these, it is iutticient to answer, that, if the
volunteers- are militia, the considerations of
dangerandinexpediencedo not apply to them;
and it they are a handing army, the conftitU'
tional doubt must bent an end.
It was in this way that the arguments of his
colleague were in oppolitien to each other ;
taken separately, it could be demonstrated
that they are as fallacious, as they are con
tradictory.âlie had firft told the committee
that the objedl of this bill, which is to enable
the government to avail itfelf of the general
enthusiasm, and to bring into the service oÂ£
the country its young and active citizens,
might as well be attained by accepting the
service of the volunteer companies, who un
der the existing militia laws are already arm
ed, and clothed, and equipped, and are at
tached te the eftablilhed regiments of militia.
Yet he had himfelf, in other parts of his
speech, when he had a different point to
prove, pointed out very etfential features of'
distinCtion between these and the volunteer
corps contemplated by the present bill. In
the firft place, the President is not authorized
either by the general militia law or by the aCt
oflaftfeflion for putting 80,000 in requili tion r
to require or to accept the actual service of a
ny body of militia for a longer term than three
months on one tour : whereas the volunteer*
corps, whom the President would .be au
thorized to accept, might be calle upon to
do military duty, at any time within two years
from their tender of service, and for any term
not exceeding three yearsâAgain, the power
I of the President to call olit the- militia is re
j ftridted to the cases of infiwreCtion, of actual
invasion, or imminent danger of invasion
whereas he would, by this bill, be empower
i ed to call the volunteers into actual service,
! whenever ** in his opinion the public, intercft
fliall require"âThus, in two very important
and essential points, will these volunteer corps
differ from the ordinary militia ; and of courts
it is obvious that the objects of this bill can
not be attained by the existing militia laws.
It remained, therefore, only to enquire?
whether the gentleman's arguments as to thÂ£
expediency of the meafufe were any better
founded. Mr. S. understood the objection*
on this score, to be that the proposed bill will
bring; together a corps of rich men, who fiiali
constitute a military association to be placed
at the disposal of the President of the United
States j and a body thus conftruÂ£ted his col
league stiles a (landing army of the worst kind.
The two parts of the objection arc that it will
be a military association of the rich, and that
this aflociation will be at the disposal of the Pre -
Jident. On the firft point, the ability c/f the
persons who fliall compose the volunteer
corps, to arm, clothe, and equip thenifelves
at their own expcnce, is considered as an evi
dence of wealth ; and the poffeflion of wealth
is irifid ioufiy represented as au evidence of
hostility to the liberties of the people : a mi
litary alT'ocjation is denounced as dangerous to
the constitution and laws, because it fliall be
composed of men poffefling that property
which is the strongest and aeareft bond of
their connexion with the community, the
firmed pledge of their attachment to the hap
piness and profptrity of the country; that
property, the complete protection and enjoy
ment ps which can only be secured by a free
constitution, and by wife and good laws ad
ministered with jufticc and impartialityâYet
such a body of citizens, collected for the de
fence of the country against foreign enemies,
in a season of danger, under the constituted
authorities ps the nation, is branded by his
colleague with theodiousepithet of a (landing
army âa standing army of the worst kind.â
Mr. S. could confidently appeal to the judg
ment, as well as the feelings of the committee,
to pronounce on arguments such as these, and
however well they be calculated to inflame a
mob, he was well a (lured they Could produce
no effect where they were now used. Shall
it be Paid, because a citizen is able' to arm,and
clothe, and equip himfelf for military service,
that he is dangerous and inimical to liberty ?
His colleague did notappeartq be aware how
many of our citizens this denunciation would
include. He did not recoiled that it would
apply with sis much force, to all the uniformed
militia companies, from one end of the con
tinent to the other, as to the volunteers de
figncd by this bill â¢ that it would embrace
thole very militia companies, whose services
he himfelf had recommended to aceepr, and
who have been associated under the
militia laws ; that in fact it would include
the whole body of the qiilitia of the union,
whose duty it is by law to provide their own
accoutrements. âHis colleague had indeed
intimated a diftin&ion by an expreftion calcu
lated to give an idea that the volunteers are
to be made up of merchants and Thi
insinuation, used merely ad caprandum, is
known by every body not to be founded in
fait; the volunteer companies, established by
law, and attached to every regiment of mili
tia in the United States, are known to be com
posed, with very few exceptions, of the sub
stantial yeohianry of the country, of citizen*
who will net be pleased to hear that, because
they have been ableand have had spirit enough
to uniform and equip themselves, they are
therefore enemies to the liberties of their
country: âInfaCt, it would not be easy to
conjecture any juftifiable motive for the insi
nuation of his colleague on the fubje&of the
merchants and lawyers : was it designed to
intimate that none but merchants and lawyers
have the means and the spirit to tender tUeir
services to the country in the hour of danger >
The other classes of citizens will not be flat
tered by such an inlinr.ation. Was it design
ed to imprefc a belief that the commercial
men and theÃiembcrs of the learned | iofcl
lions were less attached to the constitution and
the lav. s than their fellow citizens ' In th.^Jtry it by the eonfliwtttm of the.Umted State* In
placea at the difpolal of the President who is p'
com lunoer inchief of the tandii'id naval for- le
ces, aiid of the ui'litia w lien called into actual in
ferv ce. The law could make no other dif- â¢
portion of the volunteer corps ; and the ob- h
je'tien was pointed iga.nTi any military efta- 'â 
blilhmentof any fort : Its balis was a distrust h
of the PTPfidrnr as one of the conttituted au- e
thormes of the country. But after having i)
heard the gentleman denounce all, who are a- Â»
ble ts equip themlelves forferviee, as unfit to 11
be trailed with the defence of the country, it c
was not liirprizing to hear him denounce the %
President as unfit to be trolled with the con
duct of this defence. Â®
For himfelf, Mr. Sitgreaves could discover >Â«
in these objedtiors nothing but the spirit of 1
determined undiftinguilhing oupolition : It T>
mull be remembered, when the houle was en- c
gaged in the difcuflion ot measures for mari
tr,,ir defence, the gentlemen who opposed a
those niealures told us they would agree to a- c
ny propositions which Ihould (be calculated
for the defence of the territory of the United I
States ; yet now, when it is proposed to pre- a
pare for the defence of the territory, the pro- I
inife is forgotten or abandoned, and we are c
encountered with as many objections, and dif- t
Acuities,and embarratlinents as before. When t
it is proposed to raise regular troops, wc are *
threatened with the expence ; and when itis t
proposed to call into ferviee a body of volun- c
teers, who will fove to the country the ex- '
pence of equipments, of bounty, and various 1
other charges which are incident to the railing '
of a regular army, we are told that this saving '
is dangerous to the liberties of the people, <
and that it is arrairg iwe portion of the citi- 1
zensagairitt the reftâHis colleague is neither -
willing to pay for a navy, nor an army, nor to ;
trust the defence of the country to its own ci- <
tizens. He denounces the rich as dangerous, 1
and he will not pay those who are unable to
equip rhemfelves All the terrors ot a (land
ing army are conjured up to prevent an em- '
bodying of the citizens, while in the fame
breath he conqedes expressly, that a standing 1
army cannot yet be a cause of alarm, and that 1
America, secure in her attachment to law
and liberty, would as yet have nothing to ap- 1
prehend from oneâlt was tor his colleague '
to reconcile luch paradoxesâit was for the I
committee to determine on the success with
which they had been urged.
Mr. Otis (aid, he was extremely affefted,
though not much surprized, at the opposition
made to this feClion of the bill. Ihe Condi
tution of this country, in which all had been
taught to confide, as the great fecttrity to
our rights, is upon all occaliors introduced as
a (tumbling block in the difcudions of this
Hole, and i;Vftead of forming any fate rule
<4f conduit, it proves a mere cobweb, a mere
jaraon of political maxims, and is the foun
dation of sophisms in almolt every debate.
What is the objections of the gentleman
from Pennsylvania to this feClion of the bill t
It is, if he underltood him rightly, thatthele
Volunteers partake in some measure of the
qualities of militia, and, in ojhers, of aftand
ing army, and in some others differ from ei
ther, and that if the seCtion was agreed to as
it (lands, every conflitutional provilion with
telpeCt to the appointment of militia officers
will be violated. An answer had already been
given, which he thought plain and cpnclu
five, viz. that these volunteers will not come
tinder the denomination of militia, but of the
Handing army. The striking characterise
difference is this, that militia are bound
to serve by the laws of the country, without
any respect ta private content, and the vol
untoers will be bound only by contrail; they
will confifl only of those who come fornard
to defend theTr'country. As far astelates to
the conllitutional objection, therefore, there
is an endof it. Indeed, gentlemen themlelves
did not teem much to te'iy upon it.
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania fays,
that every conflitutional provision refpefting
the militia may be evaded, if these volun
teer corps are thus admitted into the ferviee,
and the whole body of militia may become
volunteers, and those volunteers form an ira
lnenleHanding frmy, under the command of
the Prelidem of the United States, which
might overturn the rights and liberties of the
people of this country. There could be no
quedion that every institution might be abu
sed. No doubt this House might atany time
vote to raise an army equal to all the militia,
continue it in force longer than the Conditu
tion has directed, and confnine all the re
sources of the community in support of it;
but because Congress pofleffes this sovereign
power, does it follow that they will abufeit f
The cafe itated by the gentleman Irom Penn
sylvania is an extreme cafe, and therefore
ought to form no objection to this mealure.
The whole fnbjeCt is under confideration â
the number may be limited, or the time re
ltriCted, without affecting the general princi
ple of the bill ; and it is only to answer efpe
ciil purpose that the gentleman confied his
argumnts to particular clauses of it. It was
dated by the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
that 110 pofliblc advantage could be derived
from the plan proposed by this feition, but
that many inconveniencies may arise from it.
He fays no advantage can refillt from it, be
cause there are many volunteer corps in the
militia which want filling up, and that these
young men might enter into them, and the
President would then accept them in the form
of militia. In inAver to this, he would ask
the gentleman what he would do in thole
ltates where there are 110 volunteer corps, and
consequently none of these vacancies? And
so far from this kind of corps exiltiiig in all
the dates, they are in some of them very much
tiifcoaintenanced, and he did not understand
that corps of this kind had received any kind
of laiidlion from the Legislature of the State
of Pennsylvania. He himfelf believed that
many advantages would be derived to the
country from the acceptance ol the ferviee of
these young men. The flower of our Youth,
taken from all clafles and profedions, being
ready at a moment's warning to defend the
country, mult prove tli# moll effectual and
cheip lecurity we can poflibly have against
tiny attack which may be made upon us.â
Emulous of out-doing each other in disci
pline, a military fervor will be excited inthe
country which could not be raised by means
of the militia fydem alone, and tliey will be
ready to repelinvalion, or to engage in any o
ther ferviee which the public fatety may re
quire. And if nobody else did it, he would
move to drike out the clause rcltriCling the
tife of these volunteers to the date in which
they reside, or in an adjoining ilatÂ«.
But, in order to alarm the committee, the
gentleman from Pennsylvania had called these
Youth an association of wealthy armed indi
viduals; but Mr. O. hoped the committee
would not be alarmed by founds. It would
doubtlef* be a military aflbciation. So is the
militia of the country. But we dand in need
of the ailidance of these brave Youth, and in
dead of being frowned upon, their alibciation
ought to becherifited and encouraged. Does
not tile militia, fxid Mr. O. con(id of citizens
vrho arm tltcmielve-' It certainly deesâ
therefore no proof of wealth results lrom this,
for every soldier in the militia is as much a
man of wealth Â«s a volunteer ef the Corps pro
posed to be raised. Yet the idea of the opu
lence of these individuals had been held out
in order to make this institution odious.
â¢ But did the gentleman suppose-that none
but the sons of the wealthy will turn out it*
defence of their country I Does he consider
himfelt as the protector of the poor, or their
enemyâdoes he mean, by faying this, to fa--
lyrize orto panegyrize them? His own idea
was, that citizens of all descriptions, yeo- j
manry, manufacturers and tradesmen, would
come forward and join these defenders ef their
tountry.
But it is said there is no limitation to this
bill; that the Executive may accept or rejeel
whom he pleases. Does not the President do
the fame at present, through the medium of
recruiting officers f And cowld this be con
ceived a dangerous power? Certainly not, as (j,
he could have no rule but this, to accept of
all who 4rc willing and able to serve theiT 0 ,
country. at<
But it is alledged that this force will be a c ;
formidable danding army. Here again founds
are to intimidate us. He never heard that a t(]
(landing army was dangerous to the liberties
of a country except in time of peace, and
that when an army is made up, not of citizens,
out of the banditti of the community. But Q|
we ai'e not now in a date of peace, but of ac
tual war. It is true the country is not inva- y ,
ded, but he believed a long period would a
not elapse before an invalion takes place,
when it might be too late to raise a body of C(
men for our defence. He hopid, therefore, ( j
the President would have authoritv to accept
of thelervice of these young inen, who, be- .
ing taken from the bofpm of their families
and friends, could not be supposed to form
an army dangerous to the liberties of the
country; nor did he think insinuations of this j.
kind ought to be urged.
Mr. O. remarked, that when he said we
are in a6tual war, he did not speak figura- c
tively, but literally. War is not declared, |?
but it is made upon us, and it is our duty to
defend ourlclves againlt it. But the gentle- '
man from Pennsylvania had said, that the
French will not invade us, and without that '
there can be no war. He laid it was not their n
interest, and if it were that it was npt in the v
power of the French to invade us with any ?
formidable force ; that they have every thing '
but money, but without that it wastmpofli- '
ble for them to come over and invade usâ
Mr. O. thought this a good reason why they c
Ihould attempt an invasion of this country. v
After having desolated Europe, and laid it â¢
under contribution, he supposed it would be 1
no difficult thing to induce a belief in their c
soldiers that they might find in our banks, '
and amongst our opulent citizens, a supply 1
of money. Nor was it money alone which '
they wanted, property of any kind would be
welcome. He therelore thought it highly 1
probable, that the Ihipsand troops preparing 1
against another country, when they (hall ei- '
ther have failed or succeeded in their ent,er- '
prise, may be destined for our (hores. It be- 1
came us, therefore, to make the bed defence >
we could. 1
But it was said, that these young men would !
not march to fight, or enlist for any time. 1
This was another reproach against them which
was unwarranted. We have seen, said he,
some of the young men of Philadelphia, and
from other parts of the country,embody them
selves as volunteers, and go upon a very un
pleasant and dangerous expedition, againd the
wedem infurgeuts ; and whenever an occa
sion shall again occur, he doubted not they
would again be willing to march in their
country's ferviee, provided the legislature
will ftrongground and afford them conn-.
tenance. But if they fee Congress are lul-
I led to sleep, they will very naturaHy fay,
" (ince Congress is unwilling to take aitive
' measures, it Wiii vain for us to come for
ward," and they will lose that spirit of ar
' dour which now animates them. It will give
! place to a repose that has proved fatal to eve
ry country which has given way to it, and
' which, in his opinion, it not prevented, will
: terminate in the dedruction of this country.
Â£ But he would wilh the gentleman from
, Pennnfylvania, or some other gentlemen who
â are opposed to this, and who hive been pretty
3 generally opposed to every meifure of de
fence, would fay what fubditute they propose
e in place of this measure. After a procrasti
nated felfion of more than fix months, when
' every man out of these walls is imprelfed
with the danger of our situation, it was sure*
ly necessary to provide for some defence of
â the territory of the union. They fay they
, w ill not havs a navy, because we are not ade
quate to the expence ; they agree to a few
e vessels. If you will noMhave a navy, will
you have an army I No, it is answered, not a
danding army, because it is dangerous to li
berty and expensive. Will you have a dand
ing army which (hall cost nothing ? No, be
cause that will be unconstitutional. We will
s agree to a little expence to fortify our ports
s and harbours ; to a few arms and a finall
quantity of ammunition ; but farther than
J this we will not go. We'will rely upon the
lt militia. If this, Mr. O. said, was the deter
t mination of gentlemen there was no occasion
[ for Congress to have met and debated fix
, months and finally to tell the people what
- e theycoulddo without our advice. " You
ie 1 mud rely upon your militia for defence." He
[( . fentment, indead of faying they have been
d and are willing to defend the country they
would be pleased to fay ty what system they
II propose to do it.
h Mr. O. believed this country to be in a ve
id ry hazardous situation. He believed we
d should fee a day more big with danger than
re we have ever yet seen, and it would be pru
it dent to guard against it before it comes. In
ie England and Ireland .volunteer corps are
jf greatly to be depended upon for the defence
1, of thole countries in the present time of dan
>g ger; and if in those countries, which gentle
le men call despotic countrbs, they depend up
id 011 their volunteers, ought not we to have
id greater confidence in them in this country,
where citizens fight for every thing dear to
j. man, and where if we make any change in our
ie government, it mult be an exchange of a free
ns for a despotic fydemiofgÂ«vernment. We fee,
ie said he, an irruption in Europe more to be
j. dreaded than the irruption of the Goths and
e- Vandals; we fee not only ancient eftablifh
ld ments, and thronesand crowns throw n down,
iq but every thing great and good dedroyed.
;li And may not our country meet with a simi
lar fate ? May not the fame means which have
ie been employed in other countries, meet with
fe the fame success here ? They will, except
i_ that we resolve they (hall not. He could not
?e help wilhing that the old members of Con-
Id greisof 1756 were now in their places, or that
ie I those of them whole spirits are gone to receive
;d i their reward had left their mantles behind
1. them. But he was afraid that the conduit
m of gentlemen at this fedion would prove that
the present Congress had degenerated from
us the patriotism of their predccclfois and were
_ ! certainly not entitled to the biedings of their
s, [ country.

our nation, purchased at a vail expence of blood 1 * n

were we tamely to surrender, we (bould become
a contemptible and degraded people. Ps
Refolvedy That the unfriendly dilpofitions and in
condu<ft of those with whom we wiihed to con- all
tinue in perpetual amity, and their menaces and ha
most unreasonable demands, have justly excited
the most painful sensations iu every American
bosom, and rendered a reeourfe to the meins of

R'efolved, That while we admire thc wisdom, \
firmnefs and patriotism of the President of the
United States, uniformly through the
course of a long and ufeful life, we highly ap
prove of the measures that have been purfueJpi r >
for effecting a reconciliation with France, as Â°J
tiilcd in the communication of the inftru&ions
to and from our Envoys, preventing
the calamities of war, and maintaining our dig- ai

to alienate their af?t-<shons Irom the government

as an insult to the people themselves, which
ought to be resented accordingly. And at the v

that whatever differences may have fublifted a- y

J To the FPESIDENTofth* UNITED STATES.
SIR,
While the citizens of America, in every part
of the Union, are addressing you with expreflions
' of affeclion and tenders of th?ir services, at this
moil important crisis ; we, the inhabitants of
j Carlisle and its vicinity, inspired by the fame
a love of oar country, and attachment to its best
interests, desire also to express our sentiments rc
fpetfling the affairs of our nation* with becom
ing freedom. Inheriting liberty as a birthright,
j and rising above the degrading spirit of colonial
s dependence, we not only have a chara<s\er al-
I ready established as freemen and defenders of
n our country, but we are resolved to maintain
e that c)iara<her at every hazard.
Under a government of our own choice, and
n the auspices of a wife and just administration,
K we have enjoyed for a number of years as great
t a share of national prosperity and happiness, as
Ll has perhaps ever fallen to the lot of any people.
e Having eftablilhed a free government, on the f
a id basis of the general will, we could rtot but!
. grant that other nations had a right to regulate
n and manage their own internal concerns in like
y manner. In their endeavois to this end, we
y conceived we ought not to interfere, and we
wished to enjoy the blessings of neutrality and
peace; discharging at the fame time all the ob
ligations we might be under to any European
e power with the utmost good faith and impartial
-1 iI T;
The measures that have been pursued by the
Executive from time to time, to maintain such a
state of thing, and to preserve us from the evils
of war and national degradation, have met and
~ still meet with our hearty approbation. The
appointment of Envoys extraordinary, for the
~ adjustment of all our differences with France
and the ample powers with which they were
vefted for this end, manifefted the finrerefl dif
ir position for peace and justice, and the happiness
, c of both nations; nor can we consider the treat
l ment which those Envoys have received, the de-
mands that have tieen made of us, and thc
i( j threats denounced against us, if we will not
comply with their wishes, without feeling as A
mericans ought to feel, and resolving that we
{' will cheerfully concur in the fuppart of all mea
j_" j fures which shall appear neceflary for the nation
e j al defence, and the maintenance of that free
h I dom and independence which we hold most dear.
! While we join with you in humbly soliciting
_, t the froiles of Divine Providence on our national
j. affairs, and the blessings of genuine freedom,
at accept, Sir, of our sincere prayers fa* your per

When you declare your resolution to maintain
your established tfhara&er, as Freemen and .Vem

well as virtue. When you acknowledge that un- A
der a government of y ur choice, md the au

there is not a city or a village in the Sixteen
1 States that-can contradidl you, if there is one,
I hÂ«Â»pe it will assemble and declare it.
W hen you acknowledge the right of nations
to regulate their own internal concern*, on the ~
solid basis of the general will, you recognize e
one of thc highest prerogatives of man. Like * r '
all other prerogatives howevsr, it ought always oi
to be exerted with wifdum and integrity for the m
general good ; never for the purpoJet of private

When you approve the measures of the gene-

sir,
WE, the inhabitants of the town of Wilmiog'on,
in the state of North Carolina, legally convened to
> gether, feel it to-be our incumbent duty to address
you at this very important crisis of the affairs of the j
; United States in relation to the French republic,
f Permit us to affute you, that we view with entire <
. approbation the advances made by the executive au- 1
' thority of our own government to that of France, for .
an honorable and equitable adjustment of all differ
ences between thc two republics.
We do not affett to conceal that from a seeming
* congeniality of sentiment refpe&ing civil liberty, and
from the consideration that they were engaged with
America in the conflift that terminated in her inde
. pcndence .* we entertained a partiality and friendlhip
' for the people of France, so long as the eftablifh
k ment of a free and equal government appeared to be
the virtiiom object of their pursuit.
P We lament therefore, that those advances instead
of being reciprocated in the manner that from their
0 great candor and liberality, might reasonably have
" been expt&cd (and which for the intereftsof both na
n tions was devoutly to be wished) were repelled with
C- indignityand contempt; and that it has become too
0 evident that principles replete with danger to this
e country a&uue the conduit of the present French go
vernment.
,j It mud now be manifeft to the world, that the un
exampled moderation and forbearance of the govern
ment of the United States have served only to excite
to new aggrelftons on thc part of France, and that no
other alternative remains as a choice for the former,
h than conceflion which would degrade our cha rafter
as a nation, and sap the foundation of its indepen
dencyâor torifort to thofedefenfive measures which
S. theTpirit of the people and the refourccs with which
God has blessed trs, enable us to call (and wetiuft fuc
rt cefsfully) into operation.
Appreciating the advantages of peace, and contrast-
j 9 ing with them the calamities incidental to an opposite
r state of things, we deprecate the approach of
but flill we do not hesitate to declare that if that c&
tremity unavoidably becomes the final resort, all the
" exeitions that ftiould be expe&edm so just a caufefrom
c " men animated by an ardent love for their country,
and resolute to assert its rights and support its govern
t, ment, may be depended on from us.
al 'J be annals of our country afford ample testimony
,1. of the zeal with which your talents and patriotilm
0 f have been uoiformly exerted in its service ever finer it
1 aifuined an independent fitgation. Your conduct in
the discharge of the duties of the high station you
now fill, rcflc&s new luftie on your charafter, and
dignity upon'the government over which you prcfide.
n Â» Thoroughly persuaded, therefore, that it will be
at the great objeft of your administration to promote
as the fafety, honor and prosperity of our common coan
e. try, we humbly implore the blcfling of the fupremc
ij. being upon your endeavors, and that you may ex pe

take into conlideration the alarming Hate
of this country ;
Abraham Ten Broeck, Esquire, in the
Chair )
Refolded unanimoujly, That tn the opinion
of this meeting, it is our duty as good citi
zen*, when a foreign nation confidently as
serts that the American people are divided
from their government, publicly to declare
our fentimenti to our Rulert on that mo
mentous fubjeiS.
Rrfalved unanimoujly, Tl'at we entirely
approve of the condu& of the President of
the United State" towards the' French Re
public, at this alarmi g criGs.
Refotved unanimoujly, T although we
deprecate the calami'ii of war, w fel per
suaded that evrry proper overture has been
made by our government to avert it ; and
therefore we will support, with spirit a'd
fortitude, the m'eafures which shall be adopt
ed to vindicate our national honor and in
dependence-
Rrfolved unanimoujly, That we will ex
pofs t6 the deteilation of our fellow-citizens,
the perfidy of all those who, in our present
1 critical situation, endeavar either to retard
or fruftrate the exertions of government to

SIR,
r Â« WE, the citizens of Albany, having a
c lively fenfc of the danger with which our
re country is threatened by a foreign nation,
'â  beg leave to communicate to you our entire
>r approbation of your condufl. at t'>is critical
period, and to a {lure you of our sincere dif
ig position to support, with zeal and firmnefs,
whatever measures the government of the
e _ United States deem neceflary to vindicate
ip and maintain our national honor and iude
tÂ»- pendence.
" The moderation which this country ha#
uniformly manifefted towards the French,
rir Republic, notwithstanding its repeated and
unprovoked aggreflions on our neiifal and
sovereign rights, is an incontestable proof
m of our ardent solicitude to cultivate peace.
iia But there is a point beyond which even the
Â°" bltflings of peace cannot be fought without
n _ servilityâThat point has been recently
n- fixed between Franc? aud America by the
â¢'e infolerit demands made upon us, demands
no which we cannot submit to withaut pro-
J ftrat ing our independence and facrificing our
n- best l'nterefts.
cI J The prefumptuons hope, announced by
the agents of the Republic to our Envoys
Extraordinary, that the American people
fl> are divided from their government, indicates
that a perfidious attachment to the cause
$ of France, lurks amongst us, The fallacy
he of this hope it is equally our duty and our
)m interell to expose. We therefbre folemn'.y
!>â  pledge ourselves, in the molt unequivocal
manner, tofuftain, with energy, theconfti
ny tuted authorities ps our country, against all
lm the machinations of its enemies, whether
; n foreign or domestic.
'on Accept, Sir, of our best wilhes that a
gracious Providence may long preserve your
precious life, and continue to dirtft your
olc adminillration, and that when the measure
m- of your days (hall be filled, you may receive
mc the gloricAis reward that is due to eminent

GENTLEMEN,
c[ THE address of the citizens of Albany,
by has been presented to me by their Reprc
od- fentative in Congress. Mr. Glen.
t I could not look over the long roll of
IC ' C} refpet\able fubferibers, without the senti
ent mentsaf gratitude, esteem and refpeft.
ad - The li/ely sense Â»f the danger, you ex-
JJjJj press, with which our country is threaten
c{. Ed by a foreign nation, is, as well-founded,
as your appr bation of my conduft at this
ol icritical period, and your fiocere difpofitiou
â¢ to support, with zeal ?nd firmnefs, what
lift evei measures the govei nrrent of the United
States shall deem neceflary, to vindicate
and maintain, our national honor and inde
ion pendence, are. agreeable to mc, and fatis
faflory to the public,
and The moderation of this country towards
the French Republic is almost without cx
aâd ample ;it would not, certainly, have been
nch so long continued, towards any other nation
iu the worldâit is not only a proof of our
ex- desire of peace, but of our particular at
hen tachment to France.
lh e There is- indeed a point, beyond which
a love of peace, and friet-dfhip to France,
| iJ, cannot be indulged without servility.
Â«ia- Although the F'ench government ap
'gh - pears to have adopted against. us the moll
, perteft fyllem of hoftiiity in their power, it
,'er; is not for me to fay how long we (hall fr.ac-kle ourfclves, by reserves of friendship to
them.
That a perfidious attachment to France,
lurks among hi, is molt certain. We rrtay
however console ourfeives, at this time, that
it contaminates very few native Americana,
and I should hope not many naturalized
strangers. Pledges like yours will soon
reduce the number of both.
Your kind wilhes, that a gracious Provi
dence may preserve my life and direst my
admini'fration, are too affe&ing to be an
swered by me, but by prayer? for the Citi
zens of Albany and their posterity forever.

anchored off oiir Bar the evening bttfore the

vanna, loaded with sugars.
'she schooner Nancy, of NOl folk, from the
Havanna, bound for Virginia, loaded with su

I I he given for the above captures is,
that they carried naval stores and contraband *
, articles to the Havanna. a
; The Danilh brig Three Friends, from the Â£
. Havanna, boÂ»ind to" St. Thomas, cargo flip- Â£
j posed to be enemy's property.
The Hamburgh brig Frederica, from the
Havanna, with ijqq boxes i'ugar on board ;
(he wason her voyage to Hamburgh, and was o
tp call off here for orders. The reason for p
taking her is, that .Hamburgh veflels are not I
allowed, by the late orders of the king and cl
council, to cairy goods from a nation at war
with Great-Britain,to any port but their own.
This brig, .we are informe t, is to be sent this
morning to Halifax for trial. I
The brig Aurora, Woodman, which'arrived
yesterday from the Havanna, was brought to
by the Thetis, and examined ; herpapersbe
ing (uch as capt. Cochran approved of, he
permitted her to proceed.
We understand that the colleflor has re- 1
ceived a letter from an American seaman on
board the (liip Thetis, now off the bar, soli
citing the releafement of himfelf, and thirty r
American feamcn, on board said vefTel, who
have protections granted tham by the collec
tors of the United States, but which the cap- J
tain of the Thetis would not even look at.
We'likewife understand, that the collector
has particularly intere.ted himfelf in"behalf
of the said American seamen, and hasapplied
to the, British consul for the relief lolicited.
