where tbe most astonishing cure? have been effect
ed on persons judged iKcitable Uy all phyfieian*.
In aTreatife printed in London, on the properties
of this powder, liy T. Seymour, M. D. lateCkt
mift to his Majesty, there are slated two hundred'
cases, where this mod valuable remedy has proved,
infallible, in all kind of fevers t ple.ir/Jy, bloody Jjux t

is like wife the best preparative for tht small pox
and measles; oi the greatell utility lor young as
a^iÂ° r c^r l*dies at the critical epoch of their
life. The efficacy of this powder in leveral of the
above diseases has been dilcovered by chance, and
foit has been in the yellow fver lan year, by Mr.
Mahy, who cured several by admmiftermr only
two of the said powders, and loft: not a fingie pa

HAMBURG, August 29.
The Pruflian Minilter, Mr. Shultz, has
beei) mfulted in this city in open day, and
in the Itreet.
Two young Merchants, barred his pas.
sage even at hn own door with their horses.
The Pruflian ambassador grew angry ; upon
which oneof these gentlemen threatened him
with his whip. Some one obferyed to him
that lie (houli take care wh it he did, as he
was quarrelling with the ambassador of the
King of Prussia. But he replied in an in
trepid and careless manner that he did not
care for the ambassador of the king of Prufiia
and used iufulting to mi.
Mr. Shultz has taken -ip the affair very
seriously ; and preferred his complaint with
much vehemence. It is even asserted he
has given in his resignation to the Senate of
Hamburg.
RIGA, (RuffiaJ Auntft 20.
In virtue of the ferer;- orders of hi 3 Ma
jelly. to prohibit the entry of foreigners in
to iliis country, an Englilh vessel having on
botird E"glilh merchants and French emi
grants fpom England, was '.lopped until per.
miflbn is received from Pctertburg to admit
her. She has been live days at anchor in
the gnlph of Livonia, some diltance from
our road. The emigrants declare themfeives
belonging to the pretender, for whom they
have difuatches ; but they will have to wait
as well as the other?. The commandant of
kiea has not been fotry tÂ» find this oppor
tunity of paying them, for the favors which
the EVnperbr. has lavilhed ujiou the emi
grants. fuicc an afyltim has been granted
them in his dates.
In general the natives of the country are
the reception which has been gi
ven the emigrants. Another kind of jta
loufy that concurs to make them disliked is,
that which they have caused the hulbands
to entertain of their wives.
Since the Pretender ha* established his
â¢onrt at Mittau, our court ladies are be
come ma'ie'fcpquctiifh ; and. peihaps, more
amiable also ; a d this is what the men can
not bear. Several of _ our rich heireffss
have gone, so far as to prefer the indigent ga
lantry of these refugee chevaliers to the la
vage opulence of the natives of the coun
try. Among the marriages which have ta
ken place, we particularly remark that of
the Cl mte de Beaumont, who, without any
other merit, brought at his fortune only arf
elegant figure, and uncommonly seducing
manners.
It is said th3t the daughter of the gover
nor.of Kiow, is to be-married to M. De
Cazales, so well known by the part which
he plaVed in France at the commencement
of the revolution.
It is however true that the partiality of
our ladies for the French is a little over ;
and whether from the incorltancy natural
to the sex, or, that difgult had really fjc
ceedrd the amiability of their lov. r, they
seem more ihy of them. The Emperor,
more constant in his taste, contin-ies to load
and his court with favours.
The peofrte murmur. But he, whose only
aim is by this conduit to people his vail <â Â£,
tates, procures them every means of ellab
lifhing themselves. 1 here is t=o emigrant,
of a rcafonaWe age, recommended by the
French chief", who lias not obtained a
quantity of land, the produce of which is
more thau-fufficient to supply all his wants.
The remainder of the corps of Conde is
â¢xpefted here. This army whicfi has pre
served only its name, since its entry into the
Ruffian territory, for the purpose of main- â¢
taining a military jurif.iiftion over its mem
bers, is decreasing as fall as they can build
habitations. The emperor views them as
so many farmers ; and the inviting of .uhem

I do myfelf the honoi to lay before the

with an application made to me by a depu
tation from a jiumber of Indian Chiefs, of
the seven nations of Lower Canada, who
conceive they have an equitable claim to
compensation for the loss of their Hunting
Lands, within this Hate.
As they are attending in this place, for
the sole purpofc of receiving an answer to
their application, you will give me leave
to fuggell the propriety of an early a tten

For !n?u**nce agfainf* Fnti, on Dv. r el!ing-
Hoiifcs, and other Buildings (and
t>n Good? coafoktcd in f o Â£h Buildings) distant from
Philadelphia, in the United States.
I. Common lufurance*, on hazard* of the firft
dials, will be undertaken at a premium of about
hah per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous
rftques a larger preminm will be required, which
will vaiy according to circutiftances, fodeai ex
teedii}* one per cent, per annum ; bat in some in
stances, where the property insured m not only in
itfclf extra hazardous, but rendered (HH morefo
.by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and
occupations, the premium demanded will be raised
according to circumftanees.
Heufes and Ware-Houses, the walls and parti
tions of which arc wholly of or brick, well
eonflruifted, so as to b* guarded a* well as may be
â¢gsinft fires from within, and free from extra ha
zardous buildings and occcupations in their neigh
borhood, will be deemed hazardous' of the firft
dafs, and may be insured to the* full value.
Alio Goods and Merchandize, not o an extra
hazardous kind, in calks. bales, or package., de
pofitcd in fu'ch buildings, to an amount not ex
eeejing 4000 dollars ; but if more than thisfum
is required to be insured in one tenement, an addi;
tioaal premium will be required, in proportion to
circumftanees.
11. Insurances will also be made on buildings and
good- < xtra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to the risque. But it is not easy to arrange tbefe
under p:inÂ»icular lieads or clafTes. so as to dcfcribe
cich wish the ueceffary accuracy. Each caf' must
therefore be decided upon according to 'he circum
''anccsa'tfnding it ( and these circumftanees wili,
ill general, appear from the description aceompa
uymg tb'application.
Buildings partly conflruSed of brick or Hone,
are prefetyible to those wholly wooder. And in
both cases, the flile of buiWin-, how they are oc
cupied, how they are fitiiated, the neighboring
buildings, andhow occupied, are confi derations to
be taken into view. And with rcfyeit t8 goods,
their tendency, whether .from their'nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, cither
to commenieor to increase an accidental fire, and
their liability in such state to receive damage lÂ»y |
wet, or by sudden and hafiy removal, or to be So- i,
len in time of confufion and hurry, are all cir
. cumftances of weight; and the premiums must be (
proportioned accordingly. I
111. The following conditiont arc to be under
llood by trie panics.
if;. The Insurance is net binding till the ftipu- '
latci! premium Le paid ; but it lhafif be deemed ef- J
feclual frora the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately '
Cgocd or r.ot. (
ad. Insurances may be renewed at the expira- <
tion of the term of the policy , withoot further ex- i
per.feÂ« tbiui the payment of tha premium of the re
newed term, the circumftanees continuing the fame
as they were aliderflood by the Infurcrs at the time
the former insurance was made ; but the payment
of the premium is essential to such renewal ; and .
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of thuformer insurance, before he f
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during furh fime ; nor can the insurance be renew
ed 011 the former policy but by computing the *
commencement of the renewal from the expiration f
of the former insurance. The fubjefl of infor- c
ancc may ae'.crihelcfa be open to treaty for a new *
infu-ance.
3d. If any other insurance be made on the fame r
property ; it must be made known at the time of a
a;e;v( : ition, otherwffc the policy made on such ap- !
plication will be void. 3

like kind kept in the building, or amongst the pro- v
