THE PXOSPECT BE?QUE */S Â«<
â <i
At this season of the year, when the luxiriant boun- "
ties of a plentiful harvest are jufi gathered inâwhen 11
we were fondly anticipating a reduction in the prices ~
of articles of the firll neceflity, how ire our hopes â
blasted ! how is the scene overcast, and what glooms
reft on the coming winter months, for the poor, the j
J'alarift, the annuitant, and circumfcribi-d houle keeper, j "
Tlie Itaff of life bread âthe price of which rcgu- "
hies all other neceiTaries, is enhanced, and iÂ« continu- "
ally riling. Tt has long borne a price difproportioned j<>
4to any fair commercial fpccilationâin conference of ~
which, the people of the Unjted States pay more for â
it than thole fuuated in the fotui of the .European war. I
There is lomething wrong in this. The enormous price
of dour will cacrcale the price of every thing e!fe con- "
neÂ£led with fubliltence. J J.iiwill be an evil which the I
majority of the community caknot balance or counter- I Â«
ail. The confsquence will be, not an encreafe of IÂ«<
â wealth to the public, or individuals finally, but a feri- â
ous, a fatal depreciation of the circulating medium.â I
This per naps is not the worst of the buiinefsâreal dif- "
tress will impe nd ; and it behoves the prudent to fore- "
call how the evil ihall be averted. I "

Dumfries (Scotland) Ju!y 26. I Â°Â°
Died here, on the morning of the aid i n ft. in S Â°
the 38th year of his age, Rojjert Burns, he L
Scottish bard. do
His manlv form and penetrating eye ftrikintly
indicated extraoidinary mental vigour. j tlc
For originality of wit, rapidity of conception,
and fluency of nervous phrafeelogy, he waiuiri- I P - 3
vailed. cia
Animatej by the fire of nature, he uttered ftn-
â ; timents which, by their pathos, melted the heart
1 to tenderness, or expanded the mind by thrirÂ«fubli- m s
mity : As a luminary, emerging from behind a
* cloud, he arose at once into notice; and his works I
and his name can never die, while divine poesy (hall ,",' C
agitate the chords of the human heart. j V
Aiiuated by the regard whici it due to the J " e \
fliadc of such a genius, his remans were yelterday I "
interred with military honors and every suitable re- C ?"
(pe&. The corpse having been previoully convey- "
â¢ ed to the town hall,, remained thee until the sol- J f
lowing ceremony took place I
file military here, confifti-g of the Cinque Port
.cavalry, and the Angus (hire fencibles, having
handfoinely tendered thei, ft,vice,, lined the ft reels
on both fides to the buual grourd. The Royal T'
Dumfries Voluu.ce,., of which ht was a member, J'
in uniform, with crapes on their left arms, sup.4 ,
ported the bier. A party of that c.rp, f appointed
to perform the military obsequies, moving in (low f"
solemn time to the dead march in Saul, which was y
