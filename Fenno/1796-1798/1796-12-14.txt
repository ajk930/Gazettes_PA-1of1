TO BE SOLD,
A LEASE fir ftven years, from tie 2stb Mjrch next, in tilt
capital and beautiful FARM % called
ry PROS PE G T-H ILL,
Situated within one quarter of a mile from the Brandy wine
Mills, and half a mile from the borough of Wilmington.
THE dwelling house is built of (tone, two stories high,
genteely finilhed, and contains four hsndfome rooms oij
â a floor, befuies an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
cellars. It is generally thought to command the mod a
greeable profpeft of the Delaware, from the source of that
C' r ,ivci to the Capes. This profpeft ia greatly embtllifhed ky
:es a full view of a vast body of meadow, through which the
10- Chriltiana and Brandywine creeks are leen winding in beao
ng Ciful meanders. Near the house are a Kitchen, a fpaciou*
stone (table and hay loft, a barn, a carriage houle, mittt*
house, &c. and a well of as pure water as any on the conti
nent. The garden contains an acre and quarter of land, a
bounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, of
the very bell kind, brought from Maryland, and in full bear
ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a young, apple
orchard begining to bear, and leveral old trees that produce
abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental frees, ia
lies great numbers. The farnacOnfifts of near sixty acres of land,,
of good quality, and clear of incumbrances, except taxes,'
twenty of which are now in exoellent clover and timothy,
tts and ten more will be ready for (owing next spring. A re-*
â fider.ee of nearly 8 years has convinced the fubferiber that
(â¢he fiiuation is remarkably healthy, The great pod road
from Philadelphia to the Southward runs Within teventy
yards of the house. In a word, the beauties and eonveai
'Â°n ence of this iituation cannot be enumerated in an advertise*

Sunday fe'nnight, as Mrs. Mend, wife of Mr.
Thomas Mead, of Drumcondra, near Ardee, was
walking in the garden, accompanied by her filler,
Miss Bafhfort, their attacked in a tnofr furious man
ner, by a mad dog. The animal firfl leaped on
Mrs. Mead's back, without doing any other injury.
He afterwards ran at her filler, and bit ene of her
}. arms and legs in a mod (hocking manner, and with
drew. The doji, after going a (hort diftatiae, re
turned, as if not contented with what he had done,
leaped on her, and entirely tore the nose from her
face. She has continued in a mod deplorable
(late. The animal afterwards bit eleven people in
the town, and a number of pigs, dogs, Set. He
was purfaed by a party of the Dublin militia, who
overtook and (hot him, about a trvjfc from the town.

â¢ NEW YORK, December 12.
Citizens or New York, you have been witnefTes
to a terrible catastrophe, ic-the sudden dellru&ion
of a rich fqusre in the center of the city, by the
devouring element of fire. To (ay thai all gener
ous hearts mod sincerely sympathise with the fiifftr
r" ers, is not duicg judices to their feelings. This
t>road wajle buildings, filled with wealth, the
e truits of industry, and the means of fubfillence for
a numerous body of good citizens, is an oecafion
e | that deeply afflifls the human mind. Are there
I any families reduced to distress ? the charitable hand
e ! of benevolence will doubtless. afford succour, and
1 every generous effort be made to replace the means
r of a&ive indudry. Â»
j But while you are fpe&ators of the yet smoking
â j ruins of property, and while your liberality is ex
- erted to r#lieve the distressed, do not foiget to profit
by this melancholy event : turn your thoughts to
J the means of guarding against a similar calamity ;
misfartunf'into utility. A pestilence
annually affli&ing some part of the city, fweepiiig
. away valuable men, and checking that bufintfs
which is the fuppoit of its inhabitants ; together
_ with frequent conflagrations, which prostrate the
t fortunes, alarm the families, and diflurb the happi
ness of the citizensâThese are calamities that de
. 'raft immensely from the enjoyments of life, and
: retard, beyond conception, the growth and opu
s lence of this commercial city.
â¢ It becomes you to take into serious consideration,
" what means, and whether any can be devised, to
, prevent the frequent repetitions of such dillrefling
events. Thcfe are not fubjefts to be passed over
â¢ with flight refledion, or trifling efforts to provide
J against the return of disasters. They are fibjedls
' that involve the chara&er of the tity, the feeurity
ef property, the faiety of life, and the prelei ra
tion of that tranquility of mind, without which
life is hardly a blriSng.
Will not the government interfere to reltrain the'
avarice of individuals from thus exposing life and
property to the perpetual depredations of disease
aid the flames ? Is there no Jpirit in the citizens, â¢
who are the vi&inas of these difallers ? Is there no
wisdom, firmnefs and juflice in the fuperiatendinjf
adminiilration of the city, to controul the felfifh
passions, and bend thsm to thÂ« regulations necessa
ry for the public fafcty ? Is the difference in the 1
expence of wooden walls and brick ones, an object '
of such magnitude, that the properties and lives of '
citizens mult be momently expoled, and frequently
facrificed to it ? Are a few feet of earth, on an isl
and that presents near twenty miles of good har- '
scour, so immeufely precious to an individual, that '
even a gangway cannot be spared for a fire engine, 1
to extinguish flames that threaten a whole ci- J
ty\ with dettrudion ? Must every inch of ground
be occupied by the penny-wife landholder, to the '
exclusion of light and of free air, the principle of *
man, without which he mujl sicken and die ? i
, P*rdon, fellow-citizens, these ardent expoftula- 1
tions, in a man who has less interest in the welfare
of the city than mod of you ; but whofc feelings c
are alive to the fatal policy, which has laid the F
foundations of iucalcnlable evils in every part of 1
this flourifhing metropolis., A city, now an emiryo '
of one of the larged mercantile towns on earth, c
every stone and brick of which (honld be laid for 1
perpetuity, is modly built of (light materials, and r
exposed hourly to be laid in one vail mafsof ruins!

ASTONISHING IMPUDENCE. 1
[from THE ARCUS.] c
COMMUNICATION. Â«
If any additional proof of the hostility of our
government to the I'rcnch nation was wanting, it c
would be found in the Prejidenl's Speech. Tho* (1
since the l?ft meeting of congress, and the solemn f
ratification of the treaty, fifty vessels have been ta
ken from us by the Britilh, where owe has been tan
Len by the trench ; tho' our seamen have been t
enslaved, fettered, and exposed to contagious dif- I
orders and the sword 5 though even the maders of t
our (hips hive been ignominioufly whipped by Bri- f
tifli officers, not one word is mentioned on this sub- n
jeil in the President's address. All memory "of h
what is due to the character of our government and si
Britain," all " felf re/ftS" seems to be loft where o
Britain is in quedion ; thns we arc content to rely I
solely "on the judice and magnanimity of the Bri- ti
tifli monarch from them even common judice is
to be purchased by unworthy humiliation, and the tl
Sacrifice of Â«ur dearest interest. It is with their fe
conquerors only, with the French people, that we it
daie to talk of our dignity. What alas 1 Will our w
dignity avail, when put in the fcaie again ft their 6\
power? Ihe true dignity of government would c<
batrt been to have given no of offence j p
S to have construed our treaties fairly and impartial
ly ; to have filled'the delicate office of secretary of
r. (tale with foine man who underftaod the law of na
as tions, theforÂ«P6 of politeness, and who would not
r, have fubllituted arrogance for dignity, and unfoun
n- ded pretentions for fellrefped.

CONGRESS or the UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
g Tuesday, December 13.
Mr. W. Smith, from the committee to whom
referred the petitions of Thomas Lloyd, and
1 itomas Carpenter, stenographers, reported a re
* solution to the following effect, which was referred
to a committee 6f the whole lioufe'o-morrow.
* " Resolved, that the clerk of this house e*ufe
the membsrs to be furnifhed during the present
session with copies of the debates of Corigrefs,
j printed in this city, such as the members fhail chufe
j to be delivered at their lodgings, provided no high
s er price be charged for them thaD is charged to
the citizens of Philadelphia."
The bill for providing for the more effctfual pro
' mulgation of the laws of the United States, was
refcd a third time and pafTed.
Mr. W. Smith called for the order of the day
00 the answer to the Pfaident's speech.
' Mr. Giles hoped the geutleman would permit
this ftibjeft to lie over till to-morrow. The an
â  fwer contained a variety of important matter, and
he had scarcely had time to read it over.
Mr. Parker spoke to the fame effect.
Mr. W. Smith said it was unusual for the an
swer to the Prcfident's address to lie over more than
one day. He thought the fubjefts contained in it
were such as did not require much cor fideration.
Mr. Heath hoped the business would not lie e
ver. The fcfiior, he fqid, was short, and as no
thing would be done untihbe etiquette of the ad
dress was gone tnroogh, he thought no time should
be lott.
Mr. Ames had no objeflion toother business be
ing taken up before the fubjeft in queflion, in or
der to give gentlemen time to think upon it, but
he hoped they ftiould not rife without entering upon i
its confident ion.
Mr. Giles did not thjnk the object of his col
league (Mr. Heath) would be atifwered by pref- J
sing the fubjeft upon the house before gentlemen
were prepared to meet it. If ever there were a fub
jeft, he said, which required mature consideration 1
it was the present, which embraced time present, '
past and to comc. He wi(hed not unnecefi'arily to
protrafi business j but he saw in this anfwtr to the
address many things obje&ionable ; and he wished '
time to think on the fubjeft, and to prepaie fubfti a
tutes for them. He hoped therefore the business
would lie over till to-morrow. t
Mr. Sitgreaves hoped no delay would take place.
He recollected that on a former occasion when 3 1
meflagc was received from the Prefldent refpefting f
the colours of the French Republic, although k
veral members wilhed the fubjeft to lie over till next i
day, those very gentlemen who now called for de- r
lay, then declared, that to postpone the business, Â£
would be to lose the effect. He was of opinion 1;
that there was full as much refpeft due to the Pre- t
fident on this occasion, as was due to the French
Republic at the time alluded to. n
Mr. W. Lyman said that gentlemen seemed to
confidcr the answer to the Prcfident's Speech as
: merely a complimentary thing ; but he considered t;
|itas of quite a different nature. The President be. t
ing charged with the execution of the laws, made tl
communications to them on the fubjeft from time h
to time. The present communication introduced c
new matters to their notice, and were not gentle- ti
men to make up their minds Â«pon them ? The an- tl
fwer to be returned would fliew how far the house t1
eoncurred in the proposed proied*. It was not a t<
thing, therefore, that could be tranfaiaed in a mo- c
ment. And shall gentlemen be refufed a day to f<
coofider these important matters > He hoped not
The Speaker informed the House, that the firft
question would be whether the unfioifhed bnfinefs F
should be puftponed, in order to take up the an- t<
fwer to the President's speech.
Mr. Parker hoped the unfinished bnfinefs would G
not be postponed. He was not ready ro vote upon b,
the important matters contained in the address. n;
He was of opinion they (hoald *be very careful at rc
this critical juncture how they committed them
es. The President had informed them they did ui
not (land well with the French nation ; the Senate la
had already accorded with all he, had said on that
fubjeft (Mr. Parker was reminded it was not in R
order to introduce what the Seriate had done), cc
He hoped a day would be allowed for confidera- ac
tion. f
Mr. Williams said there was no precedent on th
their journals to c ountenance a delay on the pre. of
sent occasion. When a report was made, he said
it was usual to commit it to a committee of the ry
whole House ; and, if there were any different be
Opinions on the fubjeft, the answer was either re
committed or amended, and he trusted thit 00 new or
precedent would sow be made.
a!- The Speaker reminded 4he House that the quef
of lion was on poftpotfiing (he unfinifhed bufineia.
a- Mr. W ; Smith observed that it had always been
ot customary to take up the answer to the Prclideiit's
n- speech the day after it was reported, and fometimcs
on the very day. If they were bow to deviate
from this practice, he said it ffaould be for good
reasons. The fit ft reason which had been offered
r j. for a postponement was that gentlemen were not
e ] s fufficiently acquainted with the answer, and yet
T). they had proceeded to comment upon it. It would
lâ¬ _ be found, he said, that the committee had dealt
E h only in general terms, which could not be difap
an proved. There were ouly two objects upon which
lr â there could be a difference of opinion, viz. what
related to the Trench republic, and what was com.
g ( plimentary to the Prelident: the firft was exprcfTed
in generals, and he trusted the House needed not
0 . to wait till to-morrow, to consider upon the ex
j. prcffionÃ to be used towards the latter (the Speak
lc er again reminded the House of the question).
Mr. Smith said his intention was to (hew that a de
lay on the present oceafion would have an unplea
ey fant appearance. The buGnefs on a former ocea-
V) fion relative to the colours of the Frenoh republic
, e (as had already been noticed) was hurried through
;( j the House, left a failure of refpedl should appear.
He wished every refpeft now to be Ihcwn, and
_ could fee no reason for delay.- In relation u> the
unfinifhed business, it had yesterday been postpon
ed far want of information, and he did not suppose
that information had been yet obtained. He hoped,
therefore, when the chief thing in the address was
to compliment the President for his set vices, they
ihould shew their zeal by an unanimous and ready
vote.
" Mr. Nicholas thought it was not right in gen
tlemen to press the business in question upon
' the House before it had been duly considered. Nor
did he think it would be so refpeCtful to the Presi
dent, to precipitate the question, as by doing so,
e objcdlions might be brought forward, for want of
1 duly understanding the fllbjedt, which, perhaps,
'' by affording a little time, might be done away.
e For his own part, he owned lie scarcely knew the
the tnraning of the answer. The futjeft required
a confideratiori, and he thought, as to the refpeif*
which gentlemen seemed to have most in view, it
would not be lefTenÂ»d by the delay. As to prece
' dents, he was surprised to hear them mentioned.
Were the Prelident's addreffcs always the fame
f thing i No ; they' always took a review of pad
and present ; and to talk of preaedents where cases
1 could never b* alike, were to trammel the House
in an extraordinary manner. The cafe of the Pre
fldent's message refpe&ing the French colours had
been mentioned If the House had then adled
wrong, was that any rule they should continue ta
do so ? But the two cases were wholly dissimilar.
1 The one was merely an expreflion of feutiment
' which could at once be determii*ed ; but the pre
' sent question was so much interwoven with the po- ,
litics of this country, as to require great circum
fpedtion. He hoped, therefore, tbe House would
â¢ not be now pressed into the business. He Wished
as much as othfer gentlemen for an unanimous vote
on the ftibjed, and to make the departure of the
' Prelident from office as agreeable as he could with.
The question for postponing the unfinifhed bufi.
ness being put, it was negatived 43 to 31.
Mr. Stradwick froâ¢ North-Carolina (in place
of Absalom Tatem resigned) appeared and took
his oath and feat.
On a motion being made to go into the order of
the day 011 the report of the committee of claims
on the,petition of Henry Kill,
Mr. D. Foster hoped the business would be fur
ther portponed, as he had not been able to procure
the neeeffary information on the futjedt. 'It was
agreed to be pollponed.
Mr. W. Smith renewed his motion to take up
the answer of Hie Prefident't; speech.
Mr Macon objedtcd to the motion as not being
in order ; as it was an endeavour to accomplish the
fame objeftby twÂ« different ways.
The speaker declaied the motion to be perfectly
in order, as gentlemen might have voted on the for
mer question, from a wish to proceed with the unU
finifhed business. He added that it would be equal
ly in order to move to postpone the present buliuefs
to a day certain.
Mr. Nicholas'accordingly moved that this busi
ness should be postponed till to-morrow.
Mr. Coit hoped it would be postponed.
The committee was appointed last Thursday to
take the President's address into consideration, and
they had not reported till yesterday. He found
the answer reported 011 his desk this morning, but
he had not yet read it ; and though he had so much
confidence in the gentlemen upon the committee, aÂ»
to be ready now to vote on the business, yet if o
ther gentlemen were not fatisfied, upon a fuhjeft of
this importance, he thought it wrong to press them
to a hasty vote. The geptlemen fay it is a thing ot
course ; but others think not. He trusted, there
fore, the motion would be carried.
1 he motioa was put and carried.
Mr. Thatcher prefeated a petition from Constant
Freeman, a Canadian refugee, which was referred
to the committee on thatfubjedi.
Mr. Madison presented a petition from Peter,
Gree, a soldier in the late war. He was Hated to
be very old, infirm and indigent, and that he peifo
nally attended with his petition for telief. It was
referred to thi committee of claims.
Mr. Gilman, from the committee of revifal and
unfinifhed business, reported the nearly expiring
laws.
Mr. Cooper presented the petitions of John .
Roth and Catliff Mefther ; the former for a re
eonfideration of hie cafe, repeating fume unsettled
accounts, rejedVed by the committee of claims last
fefiion ; the latter, for compensation forfervices in
the last war. Both were referred to the committee
of claims. .
Mr. Sherborne moved that the petittorf of Hen
ry Titcombe, refened to the cemoiittee of claims,
be referrÂ«d to a committee of the ivliqle house.,
The motion was agreed to, and jt wastnadsth?

An address from the Legislature of the Jlate of Ver

SIK,
FROM the unrecognized situation of this Jlate, the
legillature had not an opportunity in common with
her filter states, to anticipate', by an address, the blef
fingsthat were expected from your administration.
Permit us, now, with fiuccre fatisfaCtion, to allure
you, that the event ha* juftified the mod sanguine
hopes of the legislature of Vermont, and theii' conftitu
â¢jfits
When we contrail the gloomy aspeCt, both of our

the flattering prospeCt now before us, we at once ap
preciate the advantages which immediately refulffrom
our general government, and the justice, magnanimily

lic office, yet, when we relied on the year< of anxiety
you have lpent in your country's fervire, we mull re

you Ihould piss the evening of your days, in reviewing
a well spent life, and looking forward to fctnes beyond

We receive your address to your fellow citizens, as
exprefiive of the highest zeal for their prosperity, arid
containing the bell advice ta enfurc its continuance.
We cannot, fir, close this address ( probably the last

To whick the Prelident returned the following An
swer.
To Elijah Paine and Isaac Tichenor, esquires, Senators
in Congress from the Hate of Vermont.
Gfntlemen,
WITH particular pleasure I receive the unanimous
address of the council aid genei-ai assembly of the (late
of Vermont. Although but lately admitted into the
union, yet the importance of your state, its love of lib
erty, "nd its energy, were manifefted in the earliest pe
riods of the revolution which eftablilhed our indepen
dence. Unconnected in name only, but in reality uni
ted with the confederated dates, thele felt and ac
knowledged the benefits of your co-operation. Their
.mutual lafety and advantage duly appreciated, will
never permit the union to be difiolved.
I enjoy great happiness in the tellimony you have
presented, and in the other proofs exhibited from vari
ous parts of our country, that the operations of the
general government have juftified "the hopes of our
citizens at its formation, which is recognized as the
ara of national prosperity. The voluntary acknowl
edgements of my fellow-citizens persuade me to be
lieve that my agency has contributed to produce this
tffeCt. This belief will be to me a source of perma
nent fatisfaClion, and those acknowledgments a rich
reward.
My sincere thanks are due, and I beg you gentle
men to make them acceptable to the council and gene
ral assembly of the slate of Vermont, for the very
obliging and affectionate terms in which they notice
nte and my public Services. To such confidcnce and
support, as I have experienced from councils, legifla
tivc affcrablies, ic the great body of American citizens,
,T,pwed the best exertions of every faculty I possessed :
happy now in the reflection, that our joinr labours have
been crowned with success When withdrawn to the
(hade of private life, I (hit! view with growing pleasure,
the increafirg prosperity of the United States: in the
perfect protection of their government, I trust to enjoy
my retirement in tranquility ; and then while indulg
ing a favorite Â»i(h of my heart in agricultural pursuits,
I may hope to make even my private business and
amufemtnt of forae use to my country.

N. B One motive for desiring this publication
is, to obviate a report, which had been by some
persons officioufly circulated, that my not having
been re elected at the time above referred to, was
owing, not to my desire, but the difapprobatiou
of Congress
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STAT ES.
To the public auJ private Stockholders of the Bank
of Pennsylvania.
No. 1.
AN event hitherto unknown, I believe, in the
annals of banks, hath, within five days, divulged
itfelf of a molt alarming nature in this city ; but
to calculate on the tremendous evils, that it threat
ened, is impoflible. Consolation, hswever, is de
rived from its recent discovery; because, had it
proceeded another three yearsâthe immensity of
your lofles, would have been in the ratio of his
mighty peculations. And who can fay to what'an
enormousfum, the and flexible disposition
of your late president, would have exunded itfelf?
For, if in this small space of time, he could in
gulph, in wonderful fthemes and contrivances, so
much as to leave a balance against him of one hun
dred and eleven thousand dollars ; what would not
his fertile geuius, and the ready accommodation of
his needy friends, have demanded of him, while he
held the uncontrouled purse ftringi of the great
bank of Pennsylvania ? May I not cry out, O,
fortunate public and private flockholders of this
bank ! ye have cfcaped Scylla, by a happy poflef
fion of nearly all your president's property through
a late, though " a hair breadth" investigation !
It is, gentlemen, to gua;d your vessel from run- 1
ning on the rocks of Charybdii, that hath brought
me forth on '.his lamentable occasion- And as this
anxiety for the general welfare is my only prepon
derance, so (hall it urge me, in some future papers,
tufpread my knowledge, and my advice, on the
proceedings in that bank, devoid of fear or favor.
It may be neceflary, however, to inform you that,
neither party zeal nor enmity to any individual di
rector, cause my animadverfions; âfor I have met
with no unwelcome denials, or refufals tTom them
in a collective senseâand for several of them, I am
in the habits of intimacy and friendfhip; but para
mount to all other considerations, my attachment
to my native country, is abhorrent to all peculators
âand therefore my future communications lhall
be striCtly candid, in doing justiceâ-where it can be
found. PUBLIC GOOD.
Philadelphia, Dec. 14, 1796.
For the Caxitte or tie Unites States.
Mr. THOMAS PAINE's letter to the Pre
fident having accidentally . fallen into my hands, 1
was equally surprized at the composition of inso
lence and ignorance, of which it is made lip ; and
I could not but smile when I reflected, that this in
left was striving to (lain a charaCter, which, at the
very moment of his appearance, the legislatures of
every slate in the union, are vying with each other
to emblazon. It is possible, that his malignity may
have been provoked upon a comparison of the jus
tice the people of the United States have done him
too. in the resolutions of con grefs, which are sub
joined. At the time of palling tl.em, Mr. Jaybe
ing President of Congress, it became his duty to
speak in proper terms of the criminality of this
pretended Apostle of Liberty, in answer to the
French minister's complaint against him ; and hence
it is, I suppose, that " this John had always been
the sycophant of every thing in power from Girard
in Ameiica to Grenville iu England."âThese are
the refolutioHS.
" Saturday, January 16th, 1779."
" Congress took into consideration the letters
from Thomas Paineâwhereupon a motion was
made,"
" That Mr. Thomas Paine, fecretaty to the
committee of foreign affairs, be dismissed from of
fice."
"To which an amendment was offered as a sub
stitute, in the follow! g words,"
" Thit Thomas Paine be directed to attend at
the bar of this house on Monday next, at eleven
o'clock, to aufwer whether he had any direction or
pcrmiffion from the committee of foreign affairs,
for the,publications of which he confeffed himfilf
to he the author, when he was before the house on
the 6th of January last.
" Another amendment was moved as a fubfti.
tutr to both the foregoing propositions, in the
woids following.
" Whereas Congress were about to proceed
againll Thomas Paine, secretary to the committee
of foreign affairs, for certain publications and let
ters being inconsistent with his official character
and !uty, w .en the said Thomas Paine resigned his
officeâ l'hei ciipon,
" Resolved, That the said Thomas Paine is dif
mifled from any further service in the said office, ;
and the committee of foreign affairs are directed to
call upon said Thomas Paine, and receive from him
on oath, all public letters, papers, and documents,
in his pofTeffinn.
" A fourth amendment was moved as a fubfti
tnte to the whole in the words following,"
" Resolved, that the Committee of foreign af
fairs be directed to take out of the pofleffion of
Thomas Paine, all the public papers entrulled to
him as Secretary to that committee, and then dis
charge him from that office."
" When the qutltion was about to put, a divi
sion was called for ; and the queltion being put to
adopt the _^Â»j?part,
" PafTcd in the affirmative. 1
" Ori thequtflion to adopt the second part, the
yeas and nays being required by Mr. Lovell,
" It in thÂ« affirmative.
" The question being then about to be put en
the main question, a division was called for ; and
the yeas and nays being required on the firlt part
by Mr, M'Kean,
" Resolved unatiimoufly, in the affirmative.
" On the.queftioH to agree to the second clause,
namely, and then df charge him from that'office, the
S'ares were divided."
Thn it was unanimously resolved to take the pa
peia <-.f wffi e from him ; .ifter which thclgttei
clause was immattri-d, although it was also before
carried. The diklolurc <if the secrets of his office
which waÂ« he cause ol ihe resolution, was mace as
ter he had [worn " to disclose no matter, the know
ledge of which should be acquired in confequene.
of his office, that he might be directed to keep fe
cret."
rORTHE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
NEW THEATRE.
The FAIR PENITENT,
That mafler-piece of the elegant Rowe, again drew
forth the splendid talents of Mrs. Merry, in Ca
lifta : and with pleasure we witnelTed a very respec
table audience, which had been attfaded, no doubt,
in a great measure, by the uuian of Mrs. Merry's
and Mr. Cooper's talents, as well as the strength
with which the charadlers of the play, generally,
were cast.
The lively portrait of the poor Califta, as given
by Mrs. Merry, will hardly fail to leave indelible
traces of her merit imprefTed on the remembrance
of the audience.
Through the whole of the former part of the
play, we were inelined to prefer Mrs. Whit
lock's performance of Califta. In many instan
ces, Mrs Merry's accent and cadence were falfe,
and th emphalis improperly laid ; and words
emphasized that did not require to be. In the
lalt aft, she crowned her former fame, and ef
faced from the mini l , ali concep ions of the poffi
biliiy of her being furpafTed. Iu the parting feene
with her father, (he wrung ever) heart with feeling
for her ideal anguish, and forced the tear of f>m
pathy from evtry eye. Indeed, this accomphlhed
aftrefs exceeded every prediction that could have
! been formed refpefting her, â however sanguine. Iu
Califta, (he has furmfhed a ftandatd of excellci-ce
in acting, that will long be resorted trtâHappy
will it be, if Mrs. Merry hetfclf should be always
able to aft up te it.
Mr. Cooper was chaste, dignified and correct.
He gaÂ»e not, however, all the lirength to Horatio
that the character required. Many parts demand
ed a fiimei and more energetic tone of voice.
Mr. Warren, in Scioltn, furnifhed proofs of
flrong natural powers; and his performance of ma
ny parts of the character, was at once feeling, ner.
vous and pure.
Mi. Morton gave the " gallant, gay Lothario,"
in an elegant style. This performer has seldom ap
peared to greater advantage. His improvement
has been rapid, fincc we last saw him in this cha
racter.
The rising merit of Mr. Fox, ef which we had
so conspicuous a specimen, in his Altamont, ceuld
not, without injustice, be passed over in silence
The chief defect in his performance of tbe charac
ter was, that by labouring to render his acting cor
rect, he appeared rather ftiff, formal, and somewhat
too cold. We cajnot omit, however, awatding
him gre'at credit for performing, with so much ac
a character on which, in no secondary de
gree, depends the developement and completion of
this iqterciliog drama.
We have seldom fcen a play perfumed, in which
the charaSers hav.e been better allftted, than in
the Fair Penitent, on Monday eveniDg. The remiss
ness, however, of the actors, in not committing
their refpeftive parts to memory, was too glaring
not to cÂ»n(l, : f(re a gieat drawback upon the en
tertainment of theaudien c.
All the fighting 1 waÂ« execrable.
The Managers of the Theatre have, it seems,
fallen under the difpleafure'ofcthat Atlas of Infor
mation, the very papular Philadelphia Gazette, for
bringing- forward the flale dramas of the " worm
j eaten" Shakespeare,
J For my own part, I could with to fee tbe Im
mortal Bard of Naiure mare frequently resorted to ;
ana instead of repining at the too frequent perfor
mance of the plays of the sweet swan of Avon,
every man of taste and sentiment, must consider
them as a capital (lock, whence to derive relief and
relaxation from the dramatical cant, nonfcnfe, and
plagiarisms, of modern Cumbetlands and liichbaldl.

We are happy to^ind that the loss sustained by' the
late fire, will be in a part mitigated to the proprietors,
as a number of the buildings were insured. This in
ftan<;e plainly proves the advantages resulting from this
excellent inftitdtion.
We have again the disagreeable ta{k of announ
cing i dreadful conflagration which has vifued the
city of Savannah ; am! of which we this day give
the particulars.
It appeais to have originated from accident ; and
to have been greatly increased Ky a fatal security
in the inhabitants, and a confcquent want of enter
prizing exertion at a moment when the si ft destruc
tive effects might have been checked, Â«r the imifery
which has followed been considerably abated. E
very part of the continent has, within a (hurt peri
od part, experienced the horrid viGtatinn of this ca
lamity to a truly alarming degree : and we must be
indubitably led, from this hard earned axperieuce,
to adopt every possible precaution for a llate of
greater security to our large towns ; where not on
ly the comfort and property of its own citizens are
placed at fueh hazardous Hake ; but the inteieil q{
the country at large, and the depofitg of. foreign
merchants become also so precariously involved.
