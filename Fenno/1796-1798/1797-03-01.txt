CONGRESS, OF thr UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPKESENTATIVES.
Tuesday, January 24.
The bill for enforcing the laws of the United.
States in the Hate of TenneflVeJ was read the third
time and paffcd.
Mr. Dwight Foster, from the committee of
Claims, made a report on the petitions of John
Kelly, Joseph Biggs-, Elifha Haley, and William
Smith, which were againlt the petitioners, were
twiee read and concurred in by the house,
Mr. FoUer also made report on Ihe petition of
Edward St. Law Livcrmore, whieli was in favor
of the petitioner. It was twice read, and ordered
to be committed to a committee of the whole.
Mr. R. Sprigg, jun. moved that the resolution
which he laid on the table some days ago, relative
to the aft for regulating grants of lands for military
fervicss, &c. be referred to the committee to whom
was referred a former resolution relative to the sale
;of lands north-weft of the river Qhia, Jt was're
ferred. "
â¢Mr. Page presented the petition of John Nellon,
major commandant in Virginia line during the war,
for compensation, Referred to the committee of
Claims.
Mr. Malbone,prefented a petition from the in
fpeftors and gaugers, and another from the weigh
ers and measurers of the port of Providence, Rhode
_lfland, for compensation in addition to their sala
ries. Referred to the committee of Commerce and
Manufa&ures.
Mr. Sitgreaves presented a petition from Oliver
Pollock, prying that the sum of 47*40 dollars,
which the committee of Claims had reported to be
due to him, might be paid to htm durinâ¢ the pre
sent feffion,,exprefliag at the fame time a hope that
he should be allowed the liberty of fubdantiating
his other claims on a future day. Referred to the
committee of the whole, to whom was referred a
report upon a former petition of Mr. Pollock.'
Mr. Henderfon oifertd a resolution to the fol
lowing pjtrpcfe, viz. " That the fccretary of the
t r easury to lay before the hsufe, a lilt
of the number of fubferibing creditors to the U
nited States, upon the-books of the loan-officers,
in each refpedive Hate in the union,
Â»offices have been established."
Mr. Henderfon observed, thv the reasons why
he offered this resolution, were, that applications
had*of late been made, by several of the eommHfi
oners of loans of the United States, for an increase
of salary, and he thought it was proper before a
deciiion took place upon those applications, that
the house should be poflefl'ed of the bed information
relative to the duties of the officers that ceuld be
obtained. He was of opinion, that when the fata
riesof the commiflioners of loans were firfl: eftabiifh
ecf, Congrefscotild have had no other rule by which
to apportion them, than the size and population of
the ttates, or the fumsexpefted to be loaned there
in. He thought it could easily be made apgear,
that Vieither of these principles would produce an
equitable proportionment of the fulaiies ; thecom
miflioners in the larger dates, would have much the
highest salaries, when it is vety probable, they
might have the lead share of business tonranfaft,.
and on the other hand, the commissioners of the
smaller dates would have the lead salary, with per
haps the grcated proportion of duty. Ordered to
He on the table.
The house in committee took up the fubjeft of
the military cftablifhment, which after long debates
terminated in abolishing the troops of dragoons,
Saturday, February 25.
On motion of Mr. Dwight Foster, tfce future
time of meeting Â«*.s fixed at eleven o'clock.

mation refpc&ing the expenditure of certain sums
of money mentioned in his late report tohavq been
drawn from the treaftjry, for defraying the ex
penses attending the with toreign na

On motion of Mr,. W. Smith, the house resolved
itfelf into a Committee of the whole cn she bill .making
an appropriation frr the profecutio'n of the claims as
certain citizens of the United States, for the property
csptured by the belligerent powers, Mr. Muhlenberg
in the chair j when, after a pretty long debate, and
alter an amendment by Mr.-Gallatin, authorit-ing the
expense, been agreed to, the Committee rose,
and the bill was ordered to be read a third time on
Monday, '
Mr. A. Foster, from the Committee of Enrolment,
reported the bi;lgranting certain lands to [. C. Symrnei
to be duly enrolled ; it received the signature of the
Speaker, accordingly. V
Mr. Nicholas reported a bill authorizing the re
ceipt of evidences of the Public Debt for lands of
the United States, It was twice commit
ted-to 3 committee of the whole. The house went
into a committee upon it, made a report, and it
was ordered to be tvad a third time on Monday.
Mr. Swanwick lepoited a bill for the relief of
John Blown, and another providing for the erefti
on of certain buoys in and near the harbour of Bos
ton, which were committed to a committee of the
whole on Monday.
Mr. Brent reported a bill for incorporating ehe
Cornmiffionetfi of the City cf Washington, in the
Diftrift of Columbia, which was difpofct! of in the
fame way.
On motion of Mr. Gallatin, the house resolved
itfelf into a committee of the whole on the bill to
accommodate the President of the United States,
Mr, Muhlenberg in the chair j when
Mr. Henderfon said, he wished. for information
on this fubjeft, as he haa not'fufficient to convince
him of the propriety of granting 14,000 dollars, in
addition to the furniture now in pofTeflion of the
President ; he therefore moved 1 to fluke out the
14,0C0, for the purpole of inferring SZOO. The
bill informing them that thisfum, in'addition to
what might aiifefiors the sale of fucjt of the pre
sent furniture as may be decayed, out of repair, or
unfit for use,"was to be laid out in furnifhing the
household of the President. It was very lately that
they had received a proportion from the Si-nate to
advance the salary of the President 5000 dollars ;
the bill was rejefted by that house. It appeared to
him that this bill went to effeffthe fame thing in a
different way. if the objeft was merely to fuini.li
the household of the President, he thought a much
less film would be adequate to that purpose. He
thought 5000, with the proceeds of the sale
of the present furniture, as was unfit for service,
mighf be fufficient- He had no doubt that the
sum would make the furniture of the President for
four'years to come, equal to what it had bsÂ®b Â£>c;
four years pa!i. '.-Jt'
Mr. Nicholas wifljed the gentleman wpsd leave
the fnm blank, indead of inserting 5,000,-,
Mr. Henderfon consented.
The queltion was takes and negatived 42 to 39.
The committee then roft, and the house having
taken up thefubjeft,
Mr. Nicholas said, as a majoiityof the house
was against drikingout this fun), he wilhed to have
some information why this sum was fixed upon_
aqd lor what purpose it was to be applied. No one
wished more than he did to place the President in a
ntuaiion conformable to his fiation ; bat, accord
ing to his information, this sum was more thawwas
given to the present President on his entering upon
tire office, though there-remained the whole of the
furnilute, molt of which was wotth as much at this
time as when fird purchased.
Mr. Sitgrcayes said, he would give to tho-gentle.
man all the information which he had on the fub
jeft. In the year 1778 or 1779, by a resolution
of the old Congress, an ltoufehold was effablifhed
for the president of Congress. This remained un
til the present government went into operation in
the ytar 1789. It was then resolved, that Mr.
Ofgood (houldbe requested to fit up the house in a
proper manner for the reception of the President N
of the United States. In that year the law pas
sed for compensating the President of the United
States, which enafted that a salary of 25,000 dol
lar* should be allowed him, together with the use of
the furniture then in his pofleffion, belonging to
<nc United States. This furniture coit the United
States 13,677 dollars, 83 cents. During the peri
od from 1779, when the household' was firft eltab
lllhcd, until 1789, when the President of the Uni
ted States entered upon bis office, the furniture
which had been purchased for the President of Con
gress, was so much decayed, that it required nearly
dollars to replenish it. It >vas the opinion
of the joint committee, thereffire, that in a lapse of
tight years, viz, from 1789 to the present lime, the
furniture theri purchased mud have experienced e
qual dilapidation and decay, and that a sum at lead
as la'tge as was then allowed (particularly when it
was considered that the price of goods was very
much advanced since that time) should now be al
lowed far putting the present household upon the
fame footing of refpeftabtlity and convenience wit-si
that at New-York,in 1789. Mr. S. did not know
that he could give jny further information on the
fubjeft. It was a matter of notoriety, that a great
par s t of the goods then /purchased were worn out
and deliroyed ; fuchas the household linen, crocke
ry-ware, Sic. and that the President had renewed
them at his own expehce ; insomuch that if he were
to takf out of "the house thÂ« furniture which he
had supplied, there would little remain in it besides
tables, chairs, bedsteads, and a few fucrf articles :
lince all the carpets and ornamental furniture of the
house had been purchased by himfelf.
Whillt he was up, he would wifti to obviate the
only obieftion wfiich had been adduced to this bill.
The gentleman fronfiNew-Jerfey (Mr. Heuderfon)
had ftippoled that this allowance was meant to car
ry into effeft what had been rejefted in another
way, alluding to the proposed advance of salary.
That gentleman might fee a very obvious didinfti
.on between the two things. If J,coo dollars had
been added to the falaty of the President, he could
have disposed of it as be pleased ; but the money
now propped to be granted, was to be employed
in the purchase of futniture, &c. which would re
main the property of the United States, and would
devolve upon the ncsi Prefrient. Mr. S, said, he
would add, that in the joint committee there was
not a dissenting voice to the propoluion, and he ho
ped there would not be one in the house.
The question was put for ewgroffing the bill for
a third reading, and carried, there being 50 voteÂ«
in favour of it. This day and Monday were men
tioned for the third reading, the queftiou was carri
ed for the more distant day, 40 to 35.
A raefiage was received from the Senate, inform,
ing the House, that they had refolvod that the bill
allowing a drawback on Domestic Spirits exported
by the Miffifippi in v,eflels of less than 30 tons bur
then, should be poflponed till next session ; that
they had pafled the bill for the benefit of the widow
de Neufville : the bill for allowing the Secretary
of.the Treafuiy to remit fines in certain- cases ; the
bill for continuing in force the laws against certain
crimes committed against the United States; and
the Poft-Office bill wiih amendments.
The amendments to the Poft-Office bill were
read and ordered to be printed. Adjourned.
Monday, February 27.
The bill authorizing evidences of the public
debt to be received in payment for lands ; and
The bill for suspending the aft for laying a
duty upon fnuff and refined sugar, were read the
third time.
The bill miking an appropriation for prosecu
ting the alaims of certain citizens of (he United
States for property captured by the belligerent pow
ers, was n4d die third time, and after a motion
made by Mr. Kitchell to recommit it in order to
have introduced into it a provision against â¢ paying
the expence of the trials in cases where the property
was legally condemned from the veflels having had

Mr. A* Foster, fiom the committee of enroll
ments, reported several bill as duly enrolled, which
received the signature of the speaker, and were
afterwards reported to have been laid before the
President.
, Mr. W- Smith, from the committee to whom
was referred the memorial of Jud;je Turner, anjl
also that of some inhabitants of the Northwestern
territory, with the report thereon lalt feflion,
made a report. The committee recommended that
the business should come to a hearing before the
court of that territory, where the judge would have
an opportuuit'y of defending himfelf against thÂ«v
charges brought against him.
The fecretaTy of state made a report on the me
morial of fun dry citizens of the United Stales, re
lative to lofles fullained by captures, fpelutions, &c,
committed upon their property by veifels of the
French Republic, referred to him on the Btfc of
May last. The report took an extensive view of
the grievances our merchants had sustained, from
the year 1793 to the present time, and dated what
mea/urcs had been taken towards obtaining redress,
Mr. W. Smith moved to haye the report prin
ted.
Mr. Nicholas wished to know what was to be
d6ne with it. He thought it very extraordinary
that this memorial should have been referred to 1 the
secretary of state so long ago as the Bth of May,
and that a report fhuuld not have beerr made till
within four days of their adjournment. He tho't
it unneceflary to swell their printers bill which he
fuppefed would be fufficientl.y large-by having it
printed, since it would not be afted upon this ses
sion.
Mr. W. Smith fajd his reason for wiihing it to
be printed was, becaafe he wished to read it.
Mr. Nicholas said that was not, a fufficient reafan
for incurring the expence } ficec, thongh the gen.tlemao might read it, he would not hare the power pei
of acting upon it. He hoped it would not be pis
printed. v Gc
The queftian for printing was put and carried, po
A report was received from the attorney general ter
on the menioiial of John Hobby, marshal of the ha'
diftriift of Maine, which was in his favour. It was th<
raferred to a committee of the whole to-morrow. tit
Mr. Dwight Foster reported a bill which had H
been re-eonfmitted to the committee of claims, for jul
placing certain perfonp on the pension lilt. It was co
referred to a committee of the whale to-morrow. mc
Mr. W. Smith offered the following lefolution dti
to the house. to
" Resolved that a committee be appointed to pil
bring in a bill for extending the time for receiving an
on loan the domestic debt of the United States." pis
It was agreed to; a committee was appointed, so
and afterwards a bill was reported, and referred to; pe
a committee of the whole to-merrow. gr
1 On motion of Mr. W. Smith, the house tefolved bil
itfelf into a committee of the wholp on the milita
ry appropriation bill, Mr. Dent in the chair ; and, C(
after having gone through the greater part of it, po
the hour of adjournment being' arrive;?, the com- th
mittee rose, and had leave to fit again. Adjaurned, Q
Tuesday, Feb. 28. W
Mr. Livingflon, from the committee appointed let
to enquire Whether any and what alterations were
necelTary in the adt past lalt felfion for the relief and
pvoteftion of American seamen, made a report,
which wa,s referred to a committee of the whole to
mjriow.
Mr. Gallatin, from the committee appointed to
confar with a committee of the Senate, on thedil
agreting vote of the two houses on the fubjeA of
the balances due from individual state; to the United.
States, that they hadjield confer
ences with the (tommittee of the Senate, but not Sl
having coma to any agreement, the committee re- I '
commend to the house not to recede from their dis
agreement to the amendments of the Senate.
The committee to whom was referred the amend
znents of the Sf nate to the Poll-Office bill, recom-
mended the amendments to be agreed to. ~
The Sectetary of Stat<(, to whom was referred _
the petitions of George Smith and John Robert,
son, who prayed for a re payment of the money O
which they had.themselves paid for their ransom
from Algerine slavery, reported, that the ranfonjof ~
George Smith cost 2426 dollars, of which Colonel
Humphreys had paid 1J26, Â»nd Geo. Smith the re
mainder ; that by the late return of our citizens
from Algiers, the expeoce attending the redempti
on of each man was ascertained- to he 2396 dollars,
independent of the expence6 of the general nego
ciation, and allowing for small inaccuracies on ac
count of some expences which cannot at present fee 17
ascertained. He recommends therefore that George w
Smith have paid him 873 dollars, which, with the ''
sum paid by Col. Humphreys, would make about "
J4OO. John Robinson paid for his own ransom
1518 dollars, tlie interelt upon which came to 516 ''
Collars, the secretary therefore recommends that
2034 dollars be paid to him. 0
On motion of Mr. Swanwick, thi: report yvas re. *
ferred to a felcÂ£t committee. f
The house again rcfolved itfelf into a committee !'
ef thfe whole on the military appropriation bill, "
and after debating several articles they got through '
the whole. The committee rose and just as the a- a
Biendments were about to be taken up in the house,
A ir. writing was receivÂ«d"from the Pre- c
iident of th.e Uaited States, containing his objec. a
tio'ns to the bill for fixing the militaryeftablifhment.
They related to the finking out the dragoons fiom '
the eitablifhment. He thought' them neceflary. '
I"Tie mtffage and the bill were referred tp a com- 1
mittee of the whole to-morrow.
, The house took up the amendments of the Sen- '
ate to the bill for repealing so -much of a former aft '
as relates to the officering and manning of'the
frigates, and for finilhing the fame, which were, ]
to Itiike out the word repeal, and to insert, suspend
till next fejjion of Congress, and to make another part '
of the bill conformable thereto. '
Mr. W. Sir it h moved to conctjr.
Mr. Nicholas trufled the house would not con
cur fmce the fame principle ha?Tbefore been tried j
in the house "<nd rejeÂ£tÂ«^J.
The question tÂ® concur was put and carried 40
37'
Mr.Gallatin then moved to pn|lponethe furtlj-r
consideration of the bill until the fii tt Monday in
December next. The amendment of the Senate,
he fait!, which had just adopted, put the bill
uf>on tbiu ground. The law, which was of doubt- j
sol confirmation, was not to be repealed bÂ«t suspend- I
td. This we jid go to establish what was at pre
lent Joubtful. It would be as much as to declare
that the President Ihould the power to man
the frigates ; on tlie other hand, if thev said no
thing, but fuffered ths bill to die, the contrary con- !
ftrui'tjoh wpiild prevail. He thought the true
tanfmiftion of the law at present wa6, that the
President had not the power to man the vessels ; !
but, if the bill were pa (Tech, aÂ» amended, by fnf
pending the power, they would give him power.
If no bill w;s passed, h< was of opinion the Presi
dent would not attempt to man tlie frigates. He
never looked upon this bill ia any other light than
as fettling a doubtful point, and fincethe amend
ment of the Senate had been agreed to, the heft way
would be, not to pass the bill at all.
The question for poflponement, was put and car
ried 43 to 29.
The amendments from the Senate to the bill
making appropriations for the support of govern
ment for the year 1797, were taken up and%greed
to ; as were also those to
The bill laying additional duties on fundr.y arti
cles ps import. The amendments which were agreed
to weic, to add to white Cotton Goods, Velvets
and Ve'verets, â¢whether printed, flained, coloured or
other-wife, and all Muslins and Mujl'mets, two and a
half per cent. And alio a new feftion, enafting that
an aoditien of ten per eent.' should be laid upon
these articles when tmpoited in Ihips or vessels not
of the United States. The duties are to take place
after the 3 1 ft of Pecember next.
The house resolved itfelf into a committee of the
whole on the bill for placing certain peifons on the
penfian lift ; when a eonfiderable difcuflioti took ! s o
plÂ»ce on the motion to admit Samuel Hull and a -
Godfrey Sweet upon the bill. The former was pro- '
posed by Mr. Dayton (the and the lat- na ,
ter by Mr Van Alen. Neither of them, it seems, Ca
had complied with all the forms of the law, tho' I
there lentned to be little doubt that both were en ccc
titled. The only informality in the cafe of Samuel fro
Hull was that his affidavit* had been taken befsre 1 h
justices wf the peace inStead, of judges of the diftridt at
court. Mr. D. plead this paor man's cause in the p'-
most feeling manner; he laid his viound* and hi'
distress before the houlVin a way that could not fail fur
to touch every heart ; his feelings as a philanthro- the
pift and a soldier appeared in all their energyâ
and the ccnfequence was, tha.t -Samuel Hull was
placed on the penfiijn Hit. Mr. Van Alen was not x
so fuccefsful, though the cafe of Godfrey Sweet ap
peared to be an one, and he had onlv failed to i
give evidence of tlje ratio wf his difaWlity. The
bill was ordered to be engrofled for a third reading, ha

SPEAKING FIGURE.
ri
Mr. Fenno,
I H/\VE so often been deceived by advertise- f,
menu of Speaking Figures, whose comnu. i.Htion v
with the fjjeakiifg was evident at firtt light, ~
that, for lome time I felt no curiosity to vilit thai si
now exhibited in this city by Signor Faleoni. But c
I have seen it, and it is unquestionably the molt as- p
tonifhing union of philosophy and art that has ever n
been offered to the public. ' I believe i is the oniy j'
one of the kind in the â¢woild. It iÂ» a wxxen figure v
about eighteen inches in length. It is lwtj,ended c
about four feet from the floor by thin eorrfs ; and. 0
in whatever manner the fuund may be conveyed, it j
is demonstrable, it cannot be by eothmuniedtion. j
There is no partition within forty feet behind it ; j
and to exclude every fufpiciAr, of communication, j
i have seen the figure disengaged even /rem the t
cords, and held in the arms of one of the company ; J
and in this fjtuation it conversed with the fame faci t
lity and diltinitnefs as before. The voice ii re j
t markably clear and dillindt, and it leems to be con- ,
fined to no language. I have known it converse in ,
lix, with exaÂ£t propriety and putity. But thewon' .
der does not cease here. This figure will not only
speak, but blow in the ear ot anv person. This |
cannot be effefted on any of the principles of any ,
. speaking figure, I have ever seen or read of. It
will leave the city in a day or two, as I underltand. ,
y The philosopher may find fufficient in it to excreife ,
. his intelledi, and the unlearned to excite his won- j
fier. A SUBSCRIBER.
Mr. Ricketts last evening closed the Entertain- |
" nsents at the Pantheon for the present feaion, with
the greatelt eclat, by the exhibition of numerous
fplenrlio and iflor.ifiiing performances. I hcexeri'ife
3 with tlv Broad-Sword, difplayiug the different guards .
and evolutions with that weapon, in a splendid uni
r form and on a horse superbly caparisoned, was as in
n terefting a fbeilacle as could well be imagined. But
! theama7ing leaps over the foMiers with their guni and
.! bayonets, and over seven horses,' with boys mounted
' j on them, gave evidences of a ltrength and agility be
- : yond the power of conception,
Mr. Fenne,
e The excellent pieces entitled " The Warning,"
merit the attention of every real American. They
3 " ought to he republithed in every paper not devoted
| to French influence, efpecia'.ly No. IV. in Mon-
K day's Gazette. It is however tÂ» be regretted that
j the numhers have been so slowly giyen to thr pub
lie. So good a writer ought to continue his pub
lication at this criiis, when a party of traitors to
jj" the country juftifies the perfidy, insults, and robba
ry it has met with, /I Reader.

a A Correspondent, who attended Mr. Fen nell's Read

who was greatly delighted with the Recitatioi? oi the
lr " beatftifnt Poem occasioned by the Resignation of the
President and his Farewell Addref? to the People of
â¢ill the United States, Mr. F- did great justice to the coen
n position, especially on reciting it a second time, at the
e( ] request of the company, who ueftificd their approbat
ion by reiterated appliufes.
â¢ This Poem is read with pleasure by every person

From an Eajlern Paper. f( ]
Extraft of a letter from a person who has att*nded
the debates in Congress on the Anlwcr to the co|
: Prcfident's Speech, t j,,
" I know verv well there are some petlons who
have fuffercd their minds to be soured ajrainlt our
own Government, to such a degree aÂ» to think it
never does any thing right. The French depreda
tions will strengthen this ill difpotilion : For when co ,
adversity comes in at the door, it is said, love flies
out at the window, I knew a roan who was sure ca
if he met with difappointmentj and affronts abroad, ra(
to revenge himfelf, by letting loose hij bad temper
upon bis wife and children, - The' discontented CQ
party seem to go on exaftly in that method with
our constituted authorities. The French take our
vessels: then who can be tn blame but our Govern*
ment i is the general cry of these gentlemen.
" But if out own Government has fought peacd ce
with all nations, if it has done every thing and neg- 0 Â£
ledled nothing to maintain it most cordially with tr(
France, vvhere lies the blame ? The long letter ftom B j
the Secretary of State exposes to the public the j a
whole cotrefpondence with the French. No man of
candor ought to allow himfelf to blame our Govern
ment, till he has read or obtained some knowledge
! of, this to! r.fpondence. he has read and w
i maturely refledled on the principles and faÂ£ts con- w
j tained in it he will not merely conclude that the
1 United Sfates are free from ' all reproach: he will
' further aid lay, (and be obliged to fay, if he 1j n
j tefpetls tVie truth) that no government in the world -g
ever aifted in a more straight and honorable man
ner. Few, iiidee'd, have had fa very nice and diffi
cult a part to aft.
The debates in Congress bave uinformly (hewn
a like delirc for peace. Wben Britain seized our o
vessels. i -"ti or democratic patty were ready to V
ru(h tÂ«ea . n- into violent retaliating m.eafures, f 1
which would inevitably bave terminated in a war. "
Now France.takes'our vessels, the men who were
formerly so violent againlt the Bniilh are far from
' violent against the Frenchâindeed they jollify her
> piratical eondudi, though it is direftly agsinft the
faith of a folmu treaty. These who formerly re- '
coinmeadcd modetate meafutes and negociations to
" prevent a war with Britain, a6t confiftentlyon this
r new occafiot). Not a man of them ever vindfeatod
' the Britilh robberies on the feas,qr urges now any
: volient or irritating measure againlt Franceâad
- cordiugly, the people hear not a word of Embar
-00, ot Sctjneftrations, prohibition of all trade with
1 France, kc. See. (Which would be treading exacl-
iy in the Itcps of the democratic party in Congrefj j
â¢ in 1794) they will soon mark the great and ftrik.
' ing diitcreni.e of conduft between the friends to
e order and thole who are called the French party.
Â» Depend upon it, not a man in Congress has propos
ed either war or any irritating Hep in refpeft to
France. 1 have also with gieat numbeVs
1 of tilt Members in private and Ido not find one
" who is not hearty to pursue the measures of peace <
' and reconciliation.
V I pefceive that many misrepresentations are
' 6 spreading every where on this fuDjedt,but they will
y not long gain credit,
' It is really hoped that General Pinkney, our Mi
! - nifter in France, will explain and remove all the
' e complaints of that Republic.âThey are ground
lef->, aiid'Gen. Pinkney is fully inftiufted to make
that appear.
It is believed in Philadelphra, and on very proba
" blc grounds, ihat all the trouble France has made,
a and is making, for us, proceeds from the intrigues
C e of falfe Americans at Paris, in connexion with a
j s junto of the fame [lamp in this,country. They are
ii- doing to mislead France, exadlly what the Tories
n- did in 1774. to deceive Britain. But there is no
ut doubt the French will open their eyes to Gen,
Piakney's fafts and retradi their error before it has
gone so far as to alienate our affe&ions from them
for ever.

From England, we heat the luccefs of the na.?
Loan, by which the firm fu,jp it of the prefe it
measures and adipiniltration is unequivocally expre'l
ed. No other nation possesses equal refoureefv in
the pride of national character. The state of their
commerce has again been laid hefote the public in
the memorial of Exeter to the Privy Council. I*e
distress of their commerce is a favuuiite objeft w tU
the French, and their success has been beyond their
own expectations, as their vi&Ories by land have
greatly a Hilled to accomplifti, what their naval force
could never have effeÂ£ted. The fubjeA is more
painful to us, as it appears to be the ptefent great
cause of the embarrassment of the American com
merce. The French cannot fultain the thought
that their Allies should contribute to the aid ot *
commerce, which it is their firft objeft to deltroy.
In defiance of every restraint of treaty, or equity,
this distress of the British commerce is their object.
All attempts to disguise their purposes are in vain.
From the East Indies we hear of the constant suc
cess of the Englifli against the defenceless colonies
of the Dutch, but we have intimations that new
troubles will arise to the Englilh in their own colo
nies. A war witii Tippoo Saib is expedted, at the
instigation it is fuppoftd of the French, and as pro- N
bably of the Dutch from the conquered colonies of
that Republic. Englifh at the Cape of Good
Hope continue to hold the Town, and by report
we hear they intend to visit the Isle of France,
which has tor a long timn enjoyed great advantage!
over iheEnghlh fhipsin these seas. We hope nof
to expeiience the disquiets of this colony as wc have
in the Welt Indies. By the last accounts iron)
England we have assurances that the damages fut â 
tained in Newfoundland from the Ftench Fleet are
not so gieat as they were at firflt reprefcÃted,
