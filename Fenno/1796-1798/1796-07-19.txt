The real feeurities given for the payment of the Prises, nl

By accounts received from the dilterent parts of tlie
ContinciH as well as from Europe, where the tickets
* have been sent for sale, the public ate aifured that the
drawing will speedily commence, and that the Care and

noble marquis was "certainly wrong, when he con- vi
tended that nothing had been done on this head as pt
proposed by the commifiioner6 of accounts, for that m
"both Mr. Burke and Col. Barre, to whose abilities te
he paidjihe warmed eulogiums, had brought in
bills w&ich'had paSed for the better regulation of ft'
that .particular department He defended the nexf- b
point, as to the loans, very ably ; and said that they tl
'.vfre made at present in a more open manner, and tl
by a p'.lblic mode of competition, far superior to
jvhflt they ha 4 ever The unfunded u
*!<bt ? Hp also maintained, was equally benefited by tl
the present mode of conducing it ; for formerly rc
I? wis iiFual to leave it floating, as well as the navy ir
'bill?, to a confiderableamount; whereas it was now C
regularly funded at Hated periods, and even the ex- tr
pence taken in that was forrfeen to aecrue within w
the remainder ol the year. His Lordship then ad- si
verted to the office of third Secretary of (late, which a
he aflerted was, in time of war, efTentially jnecefia- w
ry. From thence he proceeded to the barracks, h
which he said were inveighed againd without due
confederation. Much bad bfen said about them
which they did not deserveâas to the measure be
-4 ing unprecedented ; how did the matter really (land ;
There were so many new, and so many old barracks
âthe .old ones were built to contain 20,00.0 men, o
and many of tlurir situations were not healthy, and n
otberwife inconvenientâthe new ones were there- o
fore fubdituted for the old, and contained only ft
15,000; so that it appeared elcarly tlwÂ« was no d
new measure. Much had been said of-i'e beinÂ£ 1111- b
conditional ; but it could not having been e
â¢in ule folong. His Lordfil'ip then defended the
army extraordinaries from the arguments whicV the t
noble marquis'had brought against them, by PneW ii
ing, that is was impofjlble to form any edimate of n
the ex.pence of a campaign, without being obliged i;
io recur to ; and dated, an ar

but muf. bave prorifions and ammunition feut witlr j:

Without blame, they mull be made good, and in all e
"such cases, which were not unfrequent in all wars, d
they mult be added to the original eflimates as ex
traordinaries. He then adverted to the tranfpott r
boa id and said, that nothing could be more necefTa- 1
1 ry than it was, and, if h# wanted a witness to prove I
th!B,he would not desire a better than the noble mar- r
qus who has (hewn thaf, during the American war, <
for want of such a boat d,the affairs of the'country had t
like to have fuffered in the mod eflential degree for t
want'of traofports. This was not a new board, but <
a revived one. In the courfeof mentioning this as ]
a branch appertaining to the Naval department of ;
the War, the Noble Marquis had made Â»fe of an 1
exprtjfion, not particularly propitious. This was an 1
observation which had sdonifhed him, indeed ; for 1
when was there a period in the English Hidory, in (
which thi3 nation had been more .Angularly amTptSV
Â«uliarly fortunate, even to a degree of -splendour, 1
in iheir naval Et.-hievements and fup&iority over
thsir enemies. Look to the Channel; to tlw Me
diterrgrreaan ; to the End and Wed-Indies'âlook
to the accounts of lall week, when so many of the
navy qf the enemy had been broiijrht into our har
bours, and it would be allowed our superiority was ;
never greater, nor the honor and spirit of our
brave tars at ,a higher pitch. His Lordship next
defended the India bill as a measure of infinite wis
dom, calculated to ensure the prosperity of that
country, and to proteA it fÂ»r the benefit of this;
anfl described it as a foarte of wealth and confe- ,
quence which was almod incalculable. With re
' gard to the Police bill, his Lordship thought that
the introduction of it ottthe present occasion, was
certainly premature at lead, and might have been
as well omitted untilit came before their Lordships
for difcuflion, which it was soon likely to do.â
The noble Marquis had obje&ed to it as not being
tlie fame with the Police of th< City of Londonâ
but he had forgot to mention the revenues which
the Corporation of London r pofTefled towards the
support ar.d maintenance of the City Police ; give
the City of Wcdminder an equal revenue, and he
had no doubt but Aldermen enough would easily be
found to fill every Ward intfc which it (hould be di
vided, and to ndrtiiniiler such revenue in a similar
Police. The Noble Lord then conduced an ar
gumentative and spirit cd defe ;ce of the present
Administration of the country, by observing, that
the Noble Marquis, when lie declined going at pre
sent iulo an examination of the finances of the
country, should have alfj dejayeÂ»j giving any opini
on which he might have formed in the general re
sult of his own private examination. He had da
ted that the pifitttre .vas frightful, but had not gi
ven the house an opportunity of viewing the Blon
der : when, howe\er, on a future night he (hjuld
t'hink proper to fhevr that piftureto the House, he
Grenvillfc) woald undertake jo point out its
beauty and proportion ; he would take care that
the exaggerated mifrepreleiitations which hard been
riÂ«de of our finances, (hould be opposed by dub
born and falemn truths ; he would then clearly
prove to the fati'sfaSiion of their Lordships, that
the bid founded public copfidence could be placed
in our refoufcis, and rtie date of our revenue and
permanent taxes were such as to exhibit to the ene
:t.y how ill-founded they were in that arrogant pre
sumption which was, he believed, in a great mca
ftrtt fcnrlt upon fullaciottsflaterteritsanid i.npreflions.
Lofd Lauderdale spoke in-fupport of the date
;%cnts and arguments of the Noble Marquis, aod
H) opposition to those of Lord Grenville. He ar
raigned the con'duft of admjnidration in the erec
tion of so many bariack6 throughout the kingdom
and, though he* did not wifli to charge the No
lÂ«e Loid with wilful midatement, yet he thought
it iieceflarv to inform the HÂ«ufe, that to the num
ber of 15,000 men, far which he had dated them
10 be ijnilt, le had u> add 9000 more, which
jnight be contained in the barracks intended to be
t uiUd. Tht: e were alfa barracks erected, ar.d to
,l c.'ertiSed in Gucinfcy ar.d Jersey, containing above
â¢ tcco men, making in the whak above 30,000.
V. ,tb refpeÂ£t to the cxtraotdiuaiics anu uiJucucc'
dtbt, and the toad which had been.r j.nle of parti -
cular good cdndact in providing for tiiem before
hand, he allowed tlist the Chaneelh: r of the Ex
chequer had proposed to fund two. t jillions of Ex
traortiinaries, and four millions of nn Â»y debt, which
he had dated at the probable expert it s in these fer
viees up to'the end of the present ye Â»r. Cut did any
pe.rlon believe that thcyjiot would Inionnt to much"
more ? He truHed the Noble Lon ) would not at
tempt to date to that House, as tl Â»c Chancellor of
the Exchequer had done to the Qimmans, that
such would be the probable amount : of the ferviccs.
He did not believe tljere was any other man but
the perlbn to whom he alluded, t .hat would have
the impndence to make a probabh 1 datcment of ihe
1 navy debt up to the 3rd of De_*ember 1796, n-
I mounting only to fotir millions, WhcK far the fird
thrse months of the year that debt incurred, a
â¢ mounted already to 2,800,00 c 3. After urging
r many other objeflions to the did (nfk parts of Lord
r Grenvilles' statement, Lord La- jderdale said, that .
men who were attached to the ct .wotry by pioperty,
1 were afraid of contemplating th e true date of their
- iinances. Men did not wtfh to speak out who had 1
1 any property at (take ; this p. jt him in mind of
- what Corneilfc, a celebrated French author, said of
, his patton Cardinal Richlieu.
' " Tout le monde en vral,

"II m'a fait tiop de biei> , your en parler malâ -1
; " II a fait trop de inal, 1 jour en parler bien."
3 Lord Lauderdale then cnt ered into a panegyric 1
,on the excellence of.our Cbfaditution, which he I
1 maintnir.rd might be upheld !jy good praÂ£lit;e, tho' <
- objectionable in theory. He condemned the.fy- I
' dem of funding, as earryvig with it famething

2 Lord Kinnoul entered, into a general defence of
; the war, and of the ci; pfequenc(sr<?fuUiÂ»g frojn it,
in which he took occa! jon to defend the prtfeti.t ad
s minidratiitii in the t rediion of barracks, snd the '
1 inditutiou of a transport board. '

, on motives of pleasure and business. He was one of> '
J those in ftappy elder brothers, who looking forward '
r to gri;;4 pofljflions, threw away their horn books
t and t'/eir multiplication tables as umieceffary.â '
s But Adl he had paid to the finance of this country 1
'f a particular attention, and he would tJndcrtake to
n fh Av that the datements of the noble Lord; who 1
n fioke lad was erroneous, when the eircumllances of I
J ihe different time's were taken into confideratidn,
n Lord Spencer defended the propriety of iiiftitHt- '
ing a tra.nfport board ; and vindicated the condnci '
r,, cf that board in fitting out the WeftTiidia expedi- 1
r tion. '
:- Lords Lauderdale and Spenccr explained,
k Lord defended the eonduft of
ie Adminidtation, and delivered his femiments in fa
r- vour of the finances of the nation, and the juftige
is and necefiity of the War.
ir The Lord Chancellor entered into a drift and '
tt minute examination of the Refolutidn proposed by
f- the Noble Marquis, which he dideclcd andcriticifed
it with accuracy and judgment. He infided that to
; agree to the motion would be to satirize the con
e- dinfl of that House in all its decisions (ince the be
ginning of the war ; and that such a resolution was
it unjud, and in many refpedls falfe irt its allegations,
as He ridiculed the idea expressed in the resolution, of
:n trade being now upheld by that which was funda
?s mentally injurious to it ; and could never agree that
- the Parliament had forfeited any portion of the pub
g lie confidence.
- Lord Lauderdale repeatedly cricd, " Hear !
:h Hear
ie The Lord Chancellor observed, that the cry of
ke Hear ! Hear 1 was not decorous ;he spoke to be
ie heardâevery man who spoke in a public afiembly
>e spoke to be heard ; but the cry of " Hear, Hear !''
Ii- was merely for the purpole of interfuptidh. Hc
ar was not, likt the Noble Eail, ia the habit of fpe'ak
r- ing in claiaerausa(Ttmb!ies jhe did not look for ap
nt planfe in (liouts and noise.
at Lord Lauderdale, after speaking on the fubjeft
e- in debate, said that it hatl been cudomary in either
34 House of Parliament to cry " Hear, Hear," when
ii- Members afTented to or pa rticularly disapproved of
e- any argument or datement advanced. It was be
a- cause he wiflved to meet the learned Lord on those
;i- points which he urged, that he had cried Hear,
n- Hear, and not with any view to interruption : but
Id jvhen that learned Loid thought proper to infinu
le ate that he had not like lutn been accuflomed to a
ts clamorous audience, he fuppoled he had forgot the
at whole hiiiory of his furm.-r ljfe ;he had fafgot that
:n he liad been more accudiimed to clamour and noise
b- thanhe (Lord La'uderdale) could havi; been. Had.
!y he so soon forgbt his former clamours in V#i}t
at tliire ? He certainly had. Or, Slaving deviated as
;d he liad'done, from the draight path of life, be
id would have recolle&ed the winding paths which
e- he had followed, and not have made an unjuit
e- charge which would leave him io open to retort,
a- The Lord Chancellor declared that he felt such
iÂ«. a'fepfe of the habits oHii, putt life, that-fiis mind- â 
e- was entirely at ease with refpeft to any iniinuati
>d 011s or charges which might be made by the noble

c- feelings, and the duty he owed the house, not to
n: enter into ar.yÃeiail or vindication of his former
o- conduct, and to treat such observations with silent
ht negligence.
n- The Marquis of Lanfdown replied at confide
in rabje length. He diflt-red from the Noble Lord
;h (Grenville) in all iu3 datements ; and he hoped the
x house was convinced that he was right. His Lord-'
to (hip mxt combated the objeflions of the Lord

Old Bailey, Saturday May 14.
Henry Wcfton was indi&ed for forging a certain
deed, purporting to be a power of attorney, and
t executed by Gen. Tonyn, with intent to defraud
r the governor andcompany of the bank of England.
1 A second comcharged the fame offence at "being
f intended to defraud Gen. Tonyn.
The cafe was rather complex : it occupied the
attention oT the court a confiderablc tune, and a'
, variety of evidence was necessarily adduced. The
t following is the outline of the cafe. It appeared

3. eÂ» of attorney, as signed, See. by the General in the
- tnontii of January lad (at which time Gen Tonyn
s was at Ipswich) authorizing him to fell the above
e properly in the funds. In the begining of last
1 month, Gen. Tonyn wrfhing to transfer his ptoper
t ty, tookthe necefFary steps for that purpole be
font a.friend to Mr. Welton at the hank, to d'elire
1 him to be prepared to make the transfer on the
f foliowiiig" day fTTiis v/at' the 7th: Mr. Wefton
wilhed to have the matter postponed, as the Bth
e would prove an iuconvenient day for tranfading the
1 business", in eor.fequence of which the Gen. agreed
3 to postpone the aifair, until the following Monday
r when it appeared that the General's property had
t been fold, aifd Mr. Welton had fled.
Mr. Sylvester, who tried the <?aufe, fnmmoned
- up the evidence : the cafe appeared to him to ad
i mit ot very little doabt; but if any remained on
e the minds ot the jury, they were bound to <n' vc the
-- unfortunate gentleman the benefit of themfand of
i the very good charade, which he bore, until ,h c

>Â» , March, 1793. ti(
We have nofmall degree of pleasure in announcing a <
_ the present work to our readers; as one which from the
freedom of its enquiry, the grandeur of its views, and the
fortitude of its principLs, is eminently deserving of atten
n tioti. .By this eulogium, we would by no means be under
:- stood to fubferibe to all the principles which these volumes
y contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived at that degree.of T
:s certainty which is reqmfite, for any .two men to thinjs a- A
is like on all fubje-Ss; neither has language attained that con
:- Client accuracy, which can enable them to convey their w
> thoughts, even when they do think alike, in a manner per- Ul]
feilly correA and intelligible to both. These difficulties
are only to be overcome by a patient, incelfant, -end bene
t, volent inveftigatittn.
e " Many of the opinions which thi< tvorit contains, *j-e 1
if bold; some of them are novel; and some doubtless are er
roneous :âbut that which ought to endear it even to those
n whose principles it may offend, is the llrength of argu
e ment adduced in it to prove, that peace and order mod ef
t feitually promote the happiness after which political re
formers are panting ; âthat as the progress faf knowledge
is gradual, political reform ought net to be precipitate;â
and that eonvulfive violence is dangerous not only to indi
viduals (for that rcfult comparative/,' would be of small
account) but to the general cause of truth. It is the op
posite of this principle that inspires the ensmiasof politic
al enquiry with so much terror ; it is the supposition that
change must inevitably be attended by the turbulence and
injustice of commotion; and that innovation cannot be
â  made without the intervention of evils more deftru&ivc
r. than those which are intended to be reformed. Under the
k aonviflion of this philanthropic sentiment, of calm and
1- gradual reform, (which in its proper place he has fully il
(l luftrated) Mr. GodWim proceeds withoutfcruple firft to en
quire into present evil, through its eifential branches, and _
next to demonstrate future good.
t- " Dividinghis work into eight books, and making mr
importance or political institutions the fubjeA of
the firft, he begins by an attempt to prove tht omnipo- T
teflce of government over the moral habits of mankind; |
and that on these moral habits their wisdom, virtue and u
felicity depend." ar
