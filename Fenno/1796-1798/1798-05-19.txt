feffional abilities, we have to request the public
not to be imposed upon by foreign artists ; but to

the work executed by both, as it is a mode almost
universally adopted by them to invalidate the ta

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
TUBÂ»DAY MA* I.
TH B SPEAKER Uid before '.e lioufe
' 1 report from tl>e eral
on certain petition# from the ftste â >
York, for alterations in the poll
tpad,. Avhicli wa. feiened to the commjttee
appointed on th{Â»
Mr. "L.yoN prcfenied a remonstrance and
petition from tliÂ« inhabitants qf the (own of
SUaftclbury, in the llpte of Vermont, dating
the eviis would arise from a state of
war. amongst which they mention as one of
the greateit an alliance with a nation whose
object is the deftruftion of Repnblicanifm ;
they pray, therefore, that merchants vessels
may not be authorized to arm, nor any tnea
jfqres which may involve the country
in war.
Mr. PAyrsoN prrfenled an address to the
fame effeÂ£t from Madison county, in the
state of Virgii.ia.
The Speaxhh laid before the house a
number of rtfolutions entered into at a meet
ing at New-Brunfwick, approving of the
contjuft of the Executive in its ntgociation
with France, and offering the lives and for
tune of the addresser* in support of the mea
sureÂ« cf .orernment.
Mr. Baer prtfeoted fame refolulions to
the fame efftfit from Frederick county, Ma
rylar.d.
Mr. SiNNiCRSON also preferited an ad
drefa from Trenton to the feme efFeS.
TL fe fevtral addrclTcs, &c. wore referred
to the committee of the whole on thÂ« fifate
of ftie union.
The.house went into a committee of the
whole on the bill for the relief of V iJliaui
Imlay, commiftioner of loans for the ftatÂ« of
Conne&tcut, and the bill was agreed to
without amendment, and ordered to be read
a third time to-morrow.
Mr. Sewall called for the oider of the
day on the third resolution reported from the
committet of the whole, on the fubjcdl of
alien*, and the consideration of the following
amendment being resumed, viz. to add to it
these words : " between which and the Uni
ted, there Jhall exijl a Jlate of declared w r,"
it was agreed, and referred to the feleft com
mittee on commerce and defence, to report a
bill accordirgly.
On motion of Mr. Sewall, the house
went into a committee of ihe whole on the
! bill from the Senate, with the amendments
! proposed by a feleft committee thereto, au
, thorizing the President of the United States
, to raise a p'ovifional army, Mr. Dent in
the chair ; when the bill and the amend
j meets having been read, the firft araend
â  mfnt came under consideration, viz. to flrike
i out the following words, " whenever he
I .<I>Â«11 jnrlrra tha yiiiMli- fliall
mealrue, ' and to insert in lieu ther of, " ifl
ihe i vent of a declaration of war ngainjl the
United States, or of aÂ£lua\ inviijiin of their
territory by a foreign p tver, or of imminent
dinger ofluch invqfion, discover ed, in his opi
nion to exij). '
Mr. Gali-atin said, if this amendmen'
was adopted, it would prevent a motion be
ing made to tlrike out the firft feftion of
the bill. This amendment would certainly
make the bill better than it is at prelent, a:
it goes to define in some measure the cases in
which the provisional army may be railed ;
yit, as he conceived, the amendment did not
go far enough, and that under our present
circumftancea, it is not rieceflary or proper
to puss this bill, he would move to strike
out the firft feftion of the bi I, which would
fupercede the motion under consideration.
He would briefly ftaie his reafous for ths
motion.
He had said that the amendment remov
ed in some degree the objections against the
bill ; but it was far from removing them
altogether. He allowed the two firft con
tingenc es, viz. a declaration of wai;, or ac
tual invasion, were defii.i'e.and therefore the
constitutional objeftion which lay agaiull tht
bill, as to its transferring a pow r to tht
Executive, which is vetted by the conllituti.
on in Congress, viz. to judge of the proprie
ty of raising an army, does not lie againfl
them ; but the third, viz. when imminenl
danger of such invasion, discovered, in his
opinion, to exist, is liable to the fame con
stitutional objeftion to which the origina!
bill was liable, as it left it to the opinion or
the President to decide ihe proper time ol
raising an army.
Undoubtedly the constitution has fore
seen that in cases of imminent danger, th<
United States would need a Handing army
but it makes Congress the ju-'ge of this ne
ceffity, bvt this biil went to make the Pre
fident the judge ; yet he knew if there wer<
no other objeftion to this bill, the most ufu
al course would have be?n to have moved tc
strike out the latter part of the amendment
But he conceived it was not proper at pre
sent to pass his bill ; he believed it woul<
be fme enough to do it, when we were con
vinced of the existence of danger. And hi
did not think there were any serious appre
henfions te be entertained of an invafioa do
ring {he present session. The danger to b
apprehended was upoÂ« our trade ; but hi
expefted no attack upon our territory be
yond predatory excursions ; the landing o
a dangerous c'afs of persons from the Weft-
India ifl*nds, or an attack on the coast b
some detached frigates. But in every cafe
short of an a&ual invasion by an army, h
conceived the militia would not only b
compeient to repel the attack, but more f
than a regular army. If an invasion or in
iurreflios took p'ace in tht foiithern ftatei
[VOLUMK XIII.
where the danger seems moll to be appre
hended, the militia in the neighbourhood
would be ready immediately to reptl Â»>t f'.'jJ*
pref â¢ it. {f these ould not do it, nei heir
could a regular army. The danger tn l>Â«
apprehended in cafe of 'an infotrefr'it'n or an
atutk ofthat is wWat would take place
immediately, and thh could only 'hi pre*
vented by the militia who are on the spot, for
an wmy cbirtd not "he fup]sofed to b? always
at hand to mee: any fudd'en emergency. He
bad no doubt, therefore, the militia of the
country would be folly equal to its defence.
Ikit if they were not the volunteer corps of
cavalry, accoutrements for whi. :h were p-o
---pofed to be provided by this bill, might be
called in, and would be more effefiual than
any other force. He thought, therefore,
it would be better to negative this bill, and
to adopt the regulation, recommended t>y
the feledt committee, in a separate bill.
If the militia was equal to the tepellintr
of any attack, except fro n a regular-army, it
couIJ not be app'ehended that an invation
of thnt kind cou d take place during the
pr sent feflion. The attention of France is
at present e gaged on very different ijbjedts ;
and if it was in 'heir power, which Ue did
not think it w?s, yet as the whole of tkeii*
marine strength is engaged in a different ob
jeft of much greater importance to lhv-Hl
than the invasion of this country could be,
they would not attempt it at present. his
must be evident when it was recollefled what
a fatal! force they have empk-yed againll
Weft india islands, which they wilh to con
quer. Wc do ridt know that the' French
inean to Invade tnoiAfy j every thing an
ttrp fabjcdl arose from a(spielt*nG<Jo , bÂ«tt we
do know they wish to re take the r possessi
ons in the Weft Indies fir ce they have made
their restoration a fine qua non condition of
peace, and we know all the force they have
been able to fend agaitift them. And what
does it amount to ? In the courfo of a year
two or three frigates and a few hundred men
with arms. Thia is all the force they are a -
ble or willing to fead from home. In the
Eail Indies, where they have colonies to con
quer for themselves, or the Dutch, the fame
want of force is to b: seen. It is certain that
whilftthe Euiopean war lalts,they are either
unable or unwilling to make any great exer.
tionsat a distance from Europe. Indeed, it all
the force they have employed out of Eu
rope were to cotne againll thi, country, it
would be repulsed by the militia in any part
of the country whe e it might make it at
tack If, then, any invasion i f this coun
try is expefled, it must take place at the can*
clufion of the European war ; and if it was
then made, he had no douht of our being
able to repel it. Byt in fuqh cafe, the con
tingency on which the raising of this army
by this bill refti, would not take place till
the next session of Copgrefs. He was not,
however, under ar.y of its tak
ing place even at this time ; and When he
said this, it was not btcaiife he differed in
opinion with gentlemen a' to the ambition
of France, but because he thought i was
neither their iutere , nor in the r power to
effeft an invasion of th s cuU'itry. He be
lieved the French nation to be as ambitioqs
as the gentleman from S Carolina represent
ed i 1 to be , and he believed every nation
intoxicated with victory as she i , and pofi
ft fling power equal to her, would also be as
ambitious as (he i*. If, said he, this conn
try was situated as near to France as Italy
and Switzerland are, and our resources werj
no greater than theirs, he would agree that
we (hould be in some danger ; but, situated
as we are, he believed it would neither be in
the power of France, nor would it be her
interest if it was, to invade this eountry in
any formidable manner.
It is not the interest of Fiance to make an
attempt to invade this country, because we
have no bulintfi in the political fc le or vor
tex of Europe. It was to increase their
power in Europe, that the French have ta
ken those steps which were so often repro
bated in this house ; but they could h ve no
such view in fending a force against us. And
: though they may not always be /guided in
their conduft by the principle of interest,
their ambition mud be limited by the extent
of their power. And if, twenty years
when our populations, and confequectly our
strength, was not half what it is at present,
â¢ the attack of a nation whose force as appli
l cable to any maritime exertion asd to an in_
i vafion, was greater than that of France and
all her allies, and whose money resources
were far superior to theirs, was not able to
make an impreflion upon this country, it
i held out no flattering encouragement to
, France to make the atte.npt. He must con_
â¢ fefs he looked upon all that was said of an
invasion by Fiance as a rsere bvg bear. He
' did not believe any attempt would ever be
â  made, and if it was made, that the militia
i alone would be fufficient to repel it ; yet
. were there any thing like a certainty of such
- an event, he would not trult wholly in the
1 militia, but would call the whole of dor re
sources into motion, he wotfid haÂ»e a lland
: ing army as well as the militia.
Under ihefe impreflions, it was clear he
- could not to e for this bill, because it goes
t upon the idea of an army being n'eceffjry trÂ»
: meet an invasion, of which he thought there
. was no danger; but if there are gentlemen
who are of a different opinion, who thinlt
that an invasion will take place, and if so,
<i that we must have an army, he would a(k \t
, it could take place without being known
e some time before hand ? It certainly could
e not, as such an undertaking would not be
a entered upon without immense previous pre
i- paration.
i, What ri the iatttition. of vMÂ» bill ? It i#that if the President (h 11 think danger etifts,
he (h 11 begin to ra'fe an army. When will
he do this ? He supposed \ihen he firft
heard of preparations making for an invasion.
But in that cafe, Mr. G. wi(hcd to know
whether the firft step of the President would
not be to call Congress together ? Congress
were called together last spring, upon an
occahon far less important, and when no
imminent danger existed. When it was
known that the President could convene Con
gress within (ix weeks after he was
ced the danger of an invasion existed, he
submitted to the committee, whetherit was
proper to place the power .in the hands of
the Prefidei t, which the constitution has
placed alone in Congress, of judging when it
is proper to raise an army ?
Mr. G. said, the question was, whether
an-army of io,orcf men (hould be raised for
fix years, according to the discretion of the
PreGdent, or whether Congress (hould reserve
to itfelf the discretion of raising an army, or
not, as it (hall think proper. He said fix
years, because though the enlistments are
only to be for three years, yet the power of
enlisting was veiled in the President for three
years. I0 ; 000 men, according to the gen
tleman from Maryland (Mr. Smith) would
cost four million dollars a year. It gentle
men really believed there was at present dan
ger of an invasion, they would immediately
order an army to be raised ; but if they do
not, and chufe to fay the President (hall de
cidfi on the danger, as he conceived th sto
be a dirileftion of duty, he could not agree
to it, and therefore he wished to destroy the
bill.
Mr. Sewah, said, the gentleman from
Pennsylvania had grounded his motion on
the anconftitutionality and inexpediency of
the present bill. If it is inexpedient, it is of
little consequence whether it be constitution
al, or not ; and if unconstitutional, however
expedient it may be,, certainly thÂ« bill ought
not to be passed.
The constitution appeared to him so plain
on this fubjeft, that he knew not how it
could have been rrmcsiwd that this bill was
unconstitutional. To fay that this bifl is
unconstitutional, Vvould be to fay that Con
gress are unable to provide by anticipation
for the public defence ; yet measures have
been passed upon a different principle, which
that gentlemen had thought right. Mr. S.
referred to the law eftablilhirg the military
corps, in which the President was authoriz
ed to suspend enlistments, if he thought it
necessary. There were a variet) of ether
instances, he said, but he could only mention
one more. It was the law rcfpefting.gallics
passed tl<is fefiion, where the President had
the power given him to provide them, or
not, which was exa&ly the fame kind of '
power now proposed to be given to the Pre
sident.
He b-lieved every gentleman who attend
ed to the constitution, atsd to t'ee manner in
which it had been afted upon, could have 110
doubt upon the fubjeft. In a variety of ca
ses, Congress did not exercise their cdnfti
tutional powers themMves ; they were fre
quently obliged to authorize the President to
aft for them. And in this cafe, nothing
more is intended to be done than to autho
rize the President to raise an army, in cafe
of certain contingencies happening, viz. in
cafe of a declaration of war* of an aftual in
vasion, or of imminent danger of such invasi
on. But the latter power, it was said, left
the raising of the army to depend on the o
pinion of the President. He did not con.
eeive this. He apprehended that the faft of
the ixiftence of imminent danger was as af
certaiftable, as the other two: The Presi
dent would have to exercise his opinion in all
the thre; cases ; but not more in the last,
than in the two firft.
Mr. S. called the attention of the comtsit
tee to a clause of the constitution, where the
fame words were used in reference to the in
dividual dates keeping troops ou foot* It is
in the 2d article of the loth feftion. "No
sjtate (hall, without the consent of Congress,
lay any duty on tonnage, keep troops, or
ltiips of war, in time of peace, enter into
any agreement or compaft with another (late,
or with, a foreign power, or engage in war,
unless aftually invaded, or in such imminent
danger as will not admit of delay." Every
objeftion made to this bill, Mr. S. said,
might be made to this clause of the constitu
tion , bnt it (hews that the framers of the
Constitution were not so nice as the gentle
man from Pennsylvania appears to be. Mr.
S. thought the power proposed to be veiled'
-in the President by this bill was important
and proper. It was true, that by this means
the President might involve the country in
war before Congress could be got together ;
but if the event was necessary, every one
must rejoice that he had this power.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania suppo
ses there must be a knowledge of danger, be
fore any invasion can take place. This ar
gument would have applied against expend
ing any money on our fortifications. It
might have been said there was no need of
expence being laid out on them, except we
knew the enemy would make an attack in
that quarter. If nothing was to be done
â but upon certain jjround, we (houltl never
be defended. This army was not necessary,
he (Mr. G.) said, because we have no aftu.
al proof of preparations being made for an
invaGon of this country, and because it is
neither in the power, nor would it be in the
interest of France to invade us. This rea
soning, Mr. S. said, might answer the pur-,
pose of quisling the minds of some people,
but it was not fatisfaftory to him. He
should htmfelf suppose that it would not be
the interest of France to attempt an invasion
of this C9untry ; yet we had seen them in
vade and subjugate one country after ano
ther, where they had apparently as little in
terest to do so, as they would have to ceme
against this country. The fame inducements
which led France to invade most of those
countries, via. to obtain large sums of mo-'
ney, and other property from theai, may
aftuate htr in coming here. The army of
France appear to govern the Government of
that country aad the Executive Direftory
hate, therefore, an interefl in getting rid of
them, and if they could fend a part of tliem
to this country, they would be fatisfied,
whatever might be their fate. If many ci
tizen* of the United States have apprwieofi
ons of this kind, and ih-.fe appreherfiens
can be removed by a measure of this kind,
which would create no expence, except the
danger existed, he thought it would be a
defi rattle objeft.
For his part, he (hould certainly be in fa
vour oT tlte bill; for however distant the
danger mzty be, it is proper that we should
be prepared to meet it, if it does Â«omc.
Besides, if it was known in France that the
Prefiden; of the United States could imme
diately call out 10,000. men to at
tack wiich might be made, the knowledge
of thif'faft m ght itfelf prevent an attempt
being friade. But he was of opinion the
danger must be much more imminent than
at. present to authorize the raising of these
men. It may be supposed that England
will be under the necessity of making peace
with France. If this event happens, France
may perhaps employ a part of the British
fleet in an attack on this country, at lead
(he wul secure them from rendering any op
position to fueh an attack. By which
means, flie certainly might make such a
lodgment of men upon our coast as would
call for an army equal at least to this to re
pel them.
Suchan establishment, Mr. S. f*id, would
have greatly tile advantage over the militia.
They were out only three mont'usat a time,
and were of gourfe continually marching
and counter-marching. On jhis account
they are more exoenfive than regular troops.
The manner in which militia are difciplincd
and officered, he said, were also ifadvantages,
and it was well known that little depen
dencs could be had upon militia for any
lsng h of rime.
Mr. S. concluded by faying, that France
had at thij time a very large irmy in force on
their coast, and for ought we know, it may
be embodying for the purpose of coming a
gaioll this country. Or fappofe they were
to fend out a fleet to the Well-Indies, ; but
iafteadof going there, it come forward to
this country, could the President poflibly
know of thia in time to raise the army pro
posed ? He certainty could not. And in
such a cafe, how much worse a fvtuation
would the country he in, if inltead us enlist
ing men, he would have to call Congress to
gether before he could do it ? He hopad,
therefore, the bill would be passed, as if ne
cessity does not require it, neither the officers
will be appointed, nor the men r.'ifed
Mr. Dana observed, that the gentleman
from Pennsylvania had alledged tha the firft
feftion of this bill ought to be expunged,
for two reafoos, viz. because the bill was
unconfti utional and inexpedient;
If the bill 16 unconstitutional, the objec
tion is detifive. Why is it so? Becaufethe
gentleman from Pennsylvania fays it trans
fers to the Executive a power which is ex
pressly veiled by the Constitution in Con
gress alone. In a former argument, that
genleman referred to the tonftitution, and
said that it gave to Congress the sole power
of raising and supporting armies. Congress
has also the power of providing for caliing
forth the militia, and yet they delegate that
power to the President. In the one cafe, it
i; said â " Congress (hall have power to raise
and support armies," in the other, " Con
gress (hall have power to provide for calling
forth the militia." If this difference amoun
ted to anything, it was to fay, that where
the Constitution fays Congress are to pro
vide for doing a thing, they may delegate
their power ; but where the other phraseo
logy 13 used, they must do the aft for them
selves.
He would examine this doftn'oe, and (hew
it to be fallacious. Congress have the pow
er to provide for organizing, arming and dis
ciplining the militia; for the punishment of
counterfeiters of the securities and current
coin of the United States; and to lay and
colleft taxes. So that upon the principles
of the gentleman from Pennlylvania, Con
gress must turn tax gatherers, borrowers of
money or money brokers, apprehenders of
coiners, and recruiting fcrjeants, occupati
ons which he believed few of the gentlemen
of that house would wish to undertake, if
they were in othpr refpefts fitted for the
employments.
The gentleman's conftnrftion, therefore,
proves too much, and is perfeftly ridicu
lous. What, then, is the meaning "of this
general power placed in Congress ? He be
lieved it to be, that Congress (hall define the
number of troops to be raised, and the man
ner and the time of their service, and having
done tha , he believed they have done all
that is necessary, the reft is to be submitted
to the Executive. This p'inciplg was by no
means a novel one Ithadbeen recognized in
not less than ten different afts. But it is said
that these things only (hew that Congress
ought to be careful how they fix precedents.
But will the gentleman from Pennsylvania
come forward, as if he were the Oracle of
Political Wisdom, the only High Prieil of
the Constitution, and fay, that these autho
rities have no weight ? In doing this, he
set at nought the wisdom of all who had
preceded him. Mr. D. then enumerated
the different laws in whidi this principle had
been afted upon, and concluded by faying,
that if it was not f r incurring unnecessary
expence, he (hould be in favour of calling
out these men immediately ; but not wish
ing this, he was willing the power (hould be
placed in the President in the manner pre
pofed.
(To be continued.)

Fridayâmay 4.
The House having resolved itfelf in a committee of
the whole, on the rcfolutiÂ»n from the Senate,
granting leave to Mr Pinckney, our lateambaf
fador to Great Britain and Spun, to receive cer
tain prefenw from those courts, tod his taking
leave, Mr. Dent in tha#thair. The refolutioa
having been riad,
Mr. Bayard moved that the commitJee con
cur.
>. r M'Dowcll said, this was 3 new fsbje<9,
and, as it struck hiin, of importance. Not
withftaading he felt as mud. disposed as any j
member cf the committee to do every thing r<j- j
fpeflful KWt lite micufter to Lor.ion 2nd Ma- 1
drid ; yet, when he looked upon the caiifir.u- j
tion, ami rdlc&ed.upon the intention of the I
clause which forbid* the rcrcivit.g of prafents hy 1
our ministers, which mild I
flow from 1 precedent of this kind, he could
not eaflty brinjt himfplf to consent to it> un!.'fÂ»
some gentlemen-could fliew the propriety or ne-
I ceflity of it itl a ftrohger than he at present
saw it. If, said he, we allaw our ministers to
receive presents from foreign courts upon their
taking leave, we mÂ»jl also calculate upon giving
. presents to all thÂ« foreign ministers who come I
here, and these, we have every reason to espeft
will be constantly increasing. BeCdef, he o!>-
jefled to the principle of these prsfents. What
afe they given for ? He supposed it was to gain
thpr friendly ajd good wifties towards
the eoi|at(jr who,g*vfi.AepÂ».. He tlvwcht this
.And he believed it would be wall
now to pot a flop to the bufiuefs, as a fairer op
portunity could never occur of trying the pfin
cipl?. for if eve't eoyld be allowed, in con
fideratioÃ of public fervieee, it "could not be
better deserved than in the present cÂ«fe ; but be
lieving thte principle to he a bad one, he Ihould
therefore be opp#l'ed to it.
Mr. Bajaidfaid, every confiitutional objec
tion must vanifhou a fmgle view of the article,
because it allows that presents may be rsceived,
if the consent of Congrefe is obtained ; and so
far from the panftittttions insinuating that it
would be 9hd policy to allow these presents to be
reoeived, it proves that they might be received
if inconvenience -in receiving them could be
avoided. He supposed the confiitutional provi
vifion was meant to obligi ministers to make
known to the world whatever present! they
might receive from foreign courts, and to place
therafelvei in such 1 ftruation as to make it im
peflihle for them to he unduly influenced by any
such presents. Indeed, he supposed thefs pre
sents would produce 1 dire<SUy contrary effe&,
for when a minifler was kÂ«own to have receiv
ed* prefentof thiitkind, he would naturally be
particularly careful of all his aifliOns, left he
should be supposed to bs improperly biafTed. If
presents were allowed to be received without
number, and privately, they might produce an
improper effeft, by seducing men from an hon
attachment for their country, in favor of
that which was loading them with favors; but
any evjl of this kind was securely avoidtd by
the notoriety Â«f the a<St. "7 . .
What, said Mr. B. is this present ? It is a
goldJhuff.bajc, a gold ehaiu, 1 prilure, or Tome
trifling thing, which could have no possible ope
ration upon any man. It neceflary he be
lieved, to attend to these little civilities and ce
rcrhonies, is the want of attention to them of
ten producecd heftility between nations. He
had some doubt, from the conflitution, whether
it was necefla'ry in this cafe, to have applied to
Congress at all for leave to have received these
presents, as the offige 0/ this gentleman hid ex
pired before they were oftered. Under the old
articles of confederation, a like provision was in
being, only that the receipt of presents by our
ministers was positively forbidden, without any
exception without lejve of Congress ; but their
being allowed to be received under the present
government by consent of Congress, shews that
they might be received in certain cases. He had
indeed, been informed, that notwithstanding the
prohibition under the former cenilitution, pre
sents were frequently received by ministers ; for
though persons holding offices were forbidden
to receive presents, the moment their office ceas
ed, and they became private individuals, they
were no longer prohibited from receiving any
presents which might be offered to them.âUn
der these circumstances, he thought the resolu
tion ought to be agreed to.
Mr. W. C. Claiborne hoped the present re
solution would not be adopted. When this ftib- i
jedl was firft brought into view, he felt inclined
to favor the request. This firft irnprefliotijirofe
frum hÂ»Â» g'cw. prrrwuiU refpeet-for
and the desire he felt to gratify his wishes. But
upon a little refle<slion ; it appeared to him, that
policy dilated the propriety of rejefling the
present refolutisn. So far as relates to the con
stitutionality of receiving the presents in ques
tion, he thought no member would join in opin
ion with the member from Delaware last: up.â
By recurring to the letter of the gentleman
from S- Carolina ( Mr- Pinckney) it would ap
pear that these presents were offered to him when
lie was about to take leave of the courts to
which he was minister. He was of course, at
that time a minister of the United States, aud
came within the confiitutional prohibition.
This prohibition in the conflitution appeared
to him to be bottomed on found policy, and of
great importance to the feeurity of the happi
ness and freedom of the nation. [Mr. C. read
theclaitfe.] The objedl of this clause appear,
ed to him very different from what had been
ftatcd to be its objeil by the gentleman from DeÂ»
â¢ laware. He believed it was intended to lock up
every door to foreign influence, to the influence
of courts and monarchies, which could not but
. prove baneful to every free country. He had
been teld that it was the custom of Europe when
a favorite minister was obout to take his depar
ture, not only to present him with presents, but
also lo confer a title upon him ; and if the leave
now aiked was granted, a precedent would be
eftablifbed which h* apprehended would} at a
future day, bring the question before Congress
whether leave should be given for a citizen of
this country to receive a title from a foreign
monarch, and thus all the folly and vices of Eu
ropean courjs will be brought up for discussion
before the Congress of the United States; and
he had no doubt characters might be found who
would desire fitch a diftindlion, and others who
would advocate the granting of it. On the
contrary, he was persuaded, that if the vote of
this house negatived the present Yefolution, no
futuje application would be made on this fub
je<Â£t. The reason, in his opinion, which induc
ed the insertion of a clause in the conflitution
that presents might be received, when leave of
Congress was obtained was this ; That in the
course of events, a cafe might exist in which it
might be proper for a citizen of the United
States to receive a present from a foreign gov
ernment. Many, perhaps, might be named j
he thought of oneâSuppose an officer of our
navy were to render essential service to the vessel
of a foreign power in distress, on the high seas,
it might be proper in fueh a cafe, for Congress
to permit the officer to receive any suitable pre
sent as a reward for his service and benevolent
exertions in the cause of the unfortunate. But,
he believed, in all ordinary cases, every present
ought to be rejefted;
Mr. Otis saw no ground for the apprehen
fi.ons which the gentleman.from Tennefl'ee had
manifefted, as to the effedls to be produced by
concurring in the refolutisn now before them.
When every present to be received mull be laid
before Congress, na fear need be apprehended
from the effefls of any such presents. For it
must be presumed, that the gentleman who
makes the application has done his dtfty, as he,
at the moment he makes the application, comes
before his country to he judged. In the present
cafe, he iuppafed, no Idea could be entertained
that our minister had not done his duty, or that
he had been bribed by a foreign power, as a rea
son for not granting the requeit. But it was
: that gentlemen should afTert that if pre
i'epts were allowed 10 he received, Congrels
l might nejet be alked to consent to the intn dOc-
I tioll of titles for tbcronftitwtion expreisly h\i
I prefectsÂ«miy be received, but with refpetf to ti
l no titjc of nM>.lity stall be grant
kd." [Mr.Cliibome said, those were not th<r
words of the -con dilution to which he alluded.
What he had reference to was the following
" No person hplding any office of profit or trust
under the United S:ates, (ball, without the con
sent of Congress, iccept of any present, emol
ument, office, or title of any kind whatever,
from any King, Rrince, or foreign state. J The
I firft part, Mr. 0. said, was diftintf from the
last. Titles of nobility were exprefely forbid
den ; but presents, emoluments, offices, or ti
tles (not titles of nobility) might be reeehred,
by the consent of Congress. But as no title cf
nobility could be granted, the gentleman from
TeUiieiTee nted not be alarmed on this ground.
had not been e*fiud*fl, htflfcduld
haveluppofej, that at this . time of day, when
titles were going so faft out of fafi>ioÃ, that
there could be no fear of their obtaining here.
The intention of the con dilution, fie iaid, mufl
have been,lhat these presents should b(? received,
on their being made known to Congress, other
wise the clause would have been peremptory, as
under the old Congress.
Mr. O. said, it was altogether matter of dis
cretion in the gentleman from S. Carolina, whe
ther or not he had alked eonfent to receive the
presents in question : for he is at present no Â«f
---ficer of the United States, and he m jghr receive
them as a private citizen: He believed he had
a perfe<sl right to do so, though it might not
confirt with the deiUfecy of his chara&er. Mr.
O. said, he had it from the best authority, that
even under the old confederation, though pre
sents were unconditionally prohibited, Dr Frank
lin, Mr JefTerfon and Mr Laurens, received the
cuftomtry presents on their departure from the
foreign courts at which they employed.â
Tb-v to be sure communicated the fa<f\ to Con
gress after they had received them. And they
received them for a good reason ; because they
they could not refufe them without giving um
brage to the courts which presented them. ffc,
therefore, thought it ye r y improper for genfJe
men to suggest difficulties of the kind.which had
been brought forward, as if the gentleman mak
ing the application was personally concerned ;
it could not be coufidÂ£red as any objedl to him.
The qneftion was merely whether we would
conform, or not, to the cuftems and usages. of
othier natioas with refpe<ft to the'prefenti 1 ia
queftionj in which there certainiy could bvi no
thing either dangerous or alarming.
Mr. Macon had no doubt eongrefs had a right to
grant, leave b receive the prelents in question, and be
lieved the detrmination in thiseafe would fix the u
sage in future. He believed an application could ne
ver be made to the bouse, in which there could be
less obje&ion to the applicant, than in the present
cafe. He was convirted the gentleman from Mafla
chufetts need not to hive said that this was no objett
to the gentleman frotr S. Carolina. He was sure no
one thought so. He believed it was improper to
bring any personal eo*fidcrations into the question
He was sure there had not been a more popular aft
done for this eountry fcr a long time than the treaty
which that gentleman had concluded withSpaio. But
the committee werf told this resolution ought to be
adopted, because :t was an European custom* If,
said he, we adopt this custom, we mÂ«ft adofjt anoth
erâthat of payirg foreign naintfters who come here ;
and he owned hÂ« (hould not be willing to fee any of
them carry off the money of bis constituents, because
he did not think the coaduÂ£t of any of them wasde
ferving of such a fee.
The gentleman fom S. Carolina had made a condi
tition refufal of the presents offered to him, and he
now wishes the pfint to b$ fettled by congress, whe
ther, he (hall recede these presents or not. He had bo
idea, whether these presents were a gold fnuff box,a
gold chain, a pifture, or 300 guineas, they could
poflibly haveany etfrft upon the applicant. Nor
had he much star about the introdu&ion of titles intb
thiscountry; for if any such thing were ever propof
â¢d, there would be such a scramble for the highest a
mflngft certoin^cntlemc j n l that he believed it would
Mr. M. said, it might not always happen that the
applicants sot leave to receive these presents were free
from obie&bn ; and in such cases, very unpleasant
and pro&ably very lengthy difcuflions would Jake
place. He hoped, therefore, the custom would now j
be put an end to. *
Mr. Bayard remarked, that the gentleman from
Teuneflee feemrd to be greatly alarmed left the agree
ing to this refalution should destroy the liberties of
the country ; and that a precedent of leave being gi- 1
ven to a minifterto accept of a gold fnuff box or a
gold chain, Ihould hereafter be brought as a fan&ion
to the granting cf titles or nobility. But heafkedthe
gentleman, as a lawyer, whether he conceived that a
precedent foYgrantiiig ,-erm'flionto a mioifter to de
ceive a fnuff box, could be adduced as a precedent for
granting titles of nobility ? It certainly could not.
1 herefore, as to precedent, the gentleman might feel
himfelf perfe&lyat ease. There could be no doubt
but the congress of the Onited States might give their
consent to a citizen receiving a title from a foreign |
power j but he could not apprehend that they would
ever do so. Was this, then, to be brought as an ar
gument against allowing a gentleman, against whose ,
conduft the moll flandeious tongue had never said a
word, from receiving the customary trifling presents
011 his leaving a foreign court ?He truftcd not* He
allowed, it v/ould be a precedent for the future in this
refpeft, arid that congress might expe& to be called
upon hereafter for similar per millions. But he did
not think there was any thing alarming in this, the a.
mount would be very trifling ; and he did not know
that having a few additional gold fnuff boxes in the
country could produce any material effeft. As to the
cohftitalfoual Â«fucftton, he thought?Fwasat fre hard al
ready ftatcd it.
Mr. Venable wiftied that every thing which was
said on this fubjcfl, might be said without reference
to the gentleman making the application, but that it
might be con&dered as eftabliihinga general principle
which was to operate hereafter. It was said that it
was neceflary to accept of these presents as a point of
etiquette, and that the refufal to accept of them, might
give offence. He did not believe tnis could be the
cafe, as it was well known to the European courts,
that our government is established on principles total
ly different from theirs, and when our mmifters in
formed them that their government did not permit
them to receive presents, it mutt be a fatisfa&ory rea
son for not accepting them. He knew that these pre
sents were sometimes made in pi&area, lomc. -nesin

he, if these prefentt were not fan&ioned by custom,
would it not appear an indelicate thing to offer these
things to the minifler of a foreign country ? It cer
tainly would. If the origin of the custom was, there
fore, a bad one, the United States ought not to adopt
it, (ince they had now the choice of doing so or not.
He hoped the United States would always make fuffi
cient provision for their own ministers, and not per
mit them to receive any thing from a foreign court.
A contrary custom, to fay the least of it,jwouid prove
a very troublesome and disagreeable one.

MR; FENNO,
NEW-YORK FEDERALISM
Is all a (ham âI would not give the (not
inconsiderable portion of the genuine Ame
rican Spirit that animates Philadelphia, for
all the tinfrl of patriatifm,Â»hac_glotÂ£Xi .here,
Nobody here seems to give any attention to
the fhtte of public affairs or to have any
concern for them ; no exertion* are mad*
ro exclude foreign politics, intrigue and id
folenceor to suppress the views of domestic
faftion. Nothing of this kind" is found iji
the newspapersânothing in the places of
public resortâthe conversations at the Cof
fee House are as foreign to American affairs
as to those of China. I hearnothingof those
important topics which rhoreorlefs should oc
cupy the mind of every American- From the
view of the publi c mind here, it would pe
ter be fufpe&ed that our country is Jabour
ing under unexampled embarrassmentsâthat
foreign infolencc and rapine have desolated
our commerce and prostrated our national
honourâhave driven us to the verge of
war and heaped insult and distress upon uÂ»
beyond all example, and infnfferable by 3
free and independent nation*. I find the
people here eagerly driving at commercial
bargains, ruftjing to fix-penny vendue* and
talking for hours over a farthing per cent- in
a policy of iufurance, while the general ru
in that hangs over our heads, the storm tbat
threatens to sweep them and their project*
to perdition is entirely unheeded and un
gpjSrScS-ngainit. Qui 1I11Â» in not allâ
criminal fupiqenefsâthis rageofcommercial
avarice is not the only fin of New-York.â
It will be incredible to a PhiJadelphian, but
it is true, that while the tri-eeloured cockade
is to be met with at every corner and even
at the coffec-houfe, no man dare be seen, or
at least no man is seen with the American
cockade. It was worn, as I understand,
for a few days, and taken down for fear of
giving offence to the other partt. Great
Heavens ! who are the other party, that
they are to be thus refpefted ? Fugitive
foreigners and desperate fcoundrcls"urged on
Ky the perfidy and intrigue of French vil
lainyâyou know that in Philadelphia, no
man could walk a square with a French
cockade unless he is a French comtniffioned
officer. lam informed that at " Vauxhall
Gardens" near this place, a Fienchmenhad
the daring ihfolence to attempt te tear the
Black Cockade from the hat of a young
gentleman. I believe he did not succeed,
but his bones were not broken, and no pub
lic indignation was excited by it as I can
learn. At the Theatre last evening the
President's March was not once played or
called for; ThefrientTs of government here,
those who detest French rapine abd irtfo
lence, are inadtive, supine and funk in the
occupations of sloth and avarice ; or the
strength of the French faftion is so consider
able that they dare not oppose it. Thank
God ! we have a different tone at Philadel
phia ; I hope it wi'l be commurticated to
the drowsy drones of this place,- and ani
mate them to a jufl sense of the duty they
owe the honor of their connfry and a pro
per exertion to maintain it. They fend on
spirited addrefiVs , but those who sign them
dare not wÂ»er any emblem that would mark
them as friends of the government.

MR. FENNO, *
A few days ago an extra&of a letter from
Citizen Hedouvil e, the new agent of the
Dire&ory at St. Domiugo to Citizen Leg
tombe, the French Consul, was published
in Bache's paper. It purports to bÂ« an in
- vitation to the American merchants to con
tinue their speculations to the French ports
of St. Domingo ; ar.d left; they might be
' deterred from it by the recent decree of the
1 Direftoty relative to with Bri
tish prody&ions, he affuree them of his de
termination "to take for the rule of his
conduft towards neutrals the arret of the
cotnmiffion of the government of the 27th
I Vendemaire last." It i perhaps unnecefiary
"to give a caution against confiding in the
promises of French agents, after the uni
formly fatal experience we have had of their
disregard for faith andjuflice: yet ftrely
no merchant, not already desperate, will,
under the present afpeft of affairs, be difpo-ft-dto ventnre his property in any Frrnch
port.
JBut let us recur to the decree of the 27' h
Veademiaire which the itizen thus pro mi fes t
to make the rule of his couduift. It may <
be fpm at large in your paper of/tbt26t|b J
December last. The fallowing is part of j
its preamble :
" The pommiffion desirous of conforming â 
itfelfnot only to the orders but even to the 1
intentions of the Executive Direftory, when 1
they come to its knowledgeof decrees, &c"
The decree then, relative to neutrals laden
with British produ&ioris, being emphatically ;
â¢not only the will and intention but the aftual 1
orders of the Directory, will of course be >
pun finally executed by citizen Hedouville, '
notwithstanding his Teeming aflurances to 1
the contrary. <
UT". a Ifrjj 1
â¢ The decree of Vendemiaire enafls,
â " 1 ft. That the arret of the commiflion !
of the 18 Nivofe last, which declare* good
prise, neutral vessels cleare(J out. for English <
ports and coming from the fame, is re- '
pealed. '
2d. And nevertheless. by way of reprisals '
against the English, who, in contempt of !
the laws of neutrality, daily permit them- \
selves to stop neutral veflels bound to the
French ports of the colony, when they are '
laden with proviflons, the French cruifere '
are authorised to carry into the ports of the 1
Republic neutral veflels deftinea for English 1
ports, which have provisions on board, and '
there shall be paid to the said cruisers, by ivay
aj indemnity, one dollar for every barrel of
flour and Jolt meat they may bring in.
" 3d. The ar et of the commiflion of '
the 6th of last Nivofe, which declares good 1
prize neutral veflels destined for ports of the 1
Windward and Leeward Islands of Ameri- '
ca, delivered up to the English, occupied '
and dt fended by the emigrants, shall con- 1
tinue to be executed according to its form \ '
and renor, unl ;i , t (hall be otherwise order- 1
ed by the commiflion." 1
The remaining articles of the decree relate :
to the appointment and organization of a
Frire-Courr, the tnoft striking circumrtarices
attending which are, that of the three judges
which constitute it ; the firft named is citi
zen Adelon* " Captain of a ship in the
service of the Republic and that they are
allowed one ptr cent on the property fold un
der their decrees. No wonder then th?t on
the 2d of last November, they condemned
two American veflels bound to French ports.
It is also worth noting, that the pream- '
ble of this decree declares its objeÂ£t to be,
"to foften the measures which the commijfion
hadpurfued againfl neutrals and the means
it feemÃ are (among other things) to give :
a bounty of one dollar to their brigands for j
every barrel of flour or fait meat they ihall
plunder from an American.
MR. FENNO,
By giving the following sentiments a place in yaur
ufeful paper, you will oblige a Subscriber.
National honor is not as some represent it a
vain phantom,,* mete vox nihil pt-mterea. A ration '
without honor, iÂ» canfequently a nation without j
the main spring of powerâln lufing this essential \
ingrc<i ; Â«Ht, its energy is inevitably weakened, anil \
its spirit enfeebledâEvery nation therefore ought,
with jealous vigilance and noble courage, to watch
and defend its honor ; to be carefHl left by one I
mean fubmiffioJi, it encouraged an attack upon the
its
the continuation ot its peace. Fatal experience
convinces that one mean fubmiflion osly invites
another more enormous aggression. America it
now drove to the unhappy dilemma, of either dif
graceful fubmiflion to a dtfperate enemy, or of
4rawing the fivord, and with it preserve our
dignity, liberty and property, or die honorablyâ
This dilemma is so 'bfolutely true, that one or the
other of the f ropofitions must inevitably take place
âit admits of no medium, as did that by which a
Roman citizen wished to induce Fabius tÂ« hazard
an action with Hannibal- Fabius eluded the argu
ment of this patriotic citizen, by faying he woul4
tmporine bffforehe would rifle his life in the defence
of his country. Thi, wife policy the American go
vernment feave pursued ;we have temporized in ,
a degree beyond all eaample, submissive and pacifie.
If moderation and pafiive forbearance ere proofs
of magnanimity, we are the most magnanimous
nation on earth. Thedefpotsof France firfl plun
der, rob, and mal-treat our citizensâWe are af
tonilhed, we are alarmed, we pause,âwhat mufl 1
be done ? We fend a mimfter for the purpose of 1
" refloring harmony"âhe lays hit credentials be
fcefore the directory, they will not lifte' to his sup

tory, and then order him to quit France ! What |
nation w mld have fuffered theft insults te go un
fnjnifbed ? What nation would have borne these in- ,
juries unreclreffed ? Yet America, anxious to live in ,
peace arid hsrniory with all oations, fuopreffes her ,
angsr,"jnd fu(fains theÃltlju>ies; again fends forth I
the olive branch of peace in the hands of three Â»f '
her moll diftingmfhed citizensâThe haughty ty- ]
rants of Fiance, again treat our pacific offers with
contempt, continue plundering our citizens and des
troying our commerce,to thegreat distress & ruin of
Â»ur nation âand to fill the cup of humiliation so
the trim, after these minister's of peace petition a
longtime altheiloors of those imperious dire&ors,
they are graciously pleased to fend an agent to in
form our envoys, that they will admit them to
their prefmcr, provided they will pay them thefum
of fifty thousand pounds flerling âAnd moreover,
â¦hey have threatened us, if we do not comply with
their difgraceful and haughty demand, with the
fati of Venice, viz. Srfl wrest from us all our pro
perty, and then fell us for a price to a dcfpotic mas- a

you bear with indifference this load of the rnoft (
gross and atrocious insults ? Can you view with (
complacency this voracious enemy devouring the a
fruits of your labor and industry ? I hear you all f

Mr. Scull,
IT is rumored that tbe chief justice, now on the
circuit of the western counfieÂ« this state, iÂ». (bat
tering th? fire-brands of difcon:cnt and sedition in
his course, by operily espousing the cause of the
French direftory, and reprobating the condu& of our
own government.
This report, however unfounded, has caused me
some inquietude, because it will be eagerly embraced
by aliens and emissaries, for argument, to delude the
ignorant and the ipconfiderateâit will be no difficult
matter to persuade such characters to believe, that the
opiniors of the firft judge of the commonwealth, a
gcotlem?n grown grey in office, and diftlh^ui(lied for
his talents, can but flow from the pure fountains of
wifctom and truthâ untinflured by the prejudices of
party animqfityâunbiaffed by tbe stings of pcrfovial
mortification âuncorrupted by the mania of foreign
attachments : 6nd while the credulous and incautious
are thus beguiled, others more thoughtful and intel
ligent may reasonably conclude, that a proper sense
of the dignity of his stationâos the fofemn trust at
tached to tha: station, and the awful responsibility in
which he ftauds to his country and his God, for the
temperate and impartial administration of that trust,
would restrain the chief justice ffom mingling in the
Heentioui controversies and vulgar altercations of the
times, and much more from propagating dodiines
and opinions, of national import, which do not left
upon the solid grounds of candor and integrity.
To prevent the mifchif vous effefts of this report,
and to difarm'thofe who wish to avail themfclves of it
for ftnifter purposes, I will venture to pronounce it a
vile calumnyâfor it leems incredible that fudge
M'Kean, who ranks among the firft move's of the A
merican independence, should so entirely abandon
! his own principles, ar.d so completely desert hiscoun
i try, as to bend the witling knee to a foreign domina
tion, and become the infamous advocate of a cause
rotten to the boneâlt is impofiible that any man of
the Judge's underftariding should hazard his name,
his fame and his forturte, in the desperate defence of
a band of usurpers who disgrace tbeir species, and
have brought reproach upon the human raceâwho
have long fwce renounced the laudable motive*, which
gave birth to the French revolutionâwho have
ftnee discarded all sense of religion ! âeveiy obliga
tion of morality fâevery principle of hortor, and

theirckOru&lve do&rines, and carried their frightful
deviations over the faireft portion of the world
who have (hook the foundations of fotial order,

To the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.
Sir,
WE, the underlined Jurors attending
the Circuit Court cjf the IJnited States for
the diftrjfi ps Maryland, think it our doty
to address yon od .the alarming fituatien into
which our public affairs have bdtn bfdtight
by the unconcyiating fpfrit, ambition and
rapacity of those who now govern the Re
public of France.
At the firft dawn of she revolution in that
country, we fondly hoped that a new era
was opening upon mankind, â¢ when liberty,
julliee and humanity would take the place
of slavery, rapine and cruelty which had too
long difgraeed the world. Allured by this
delusive phantom, mar.y of us long excused
the errors and apologised for the crimes of
that ill-fated people.
But at length our eyes are opened, when
we fee them airairg deadly blows at the
small remains of republica'nifm in Europe,
and menacing us also with dfftru&ion, the
only people on earth who have ever (hewn
them sincere friendfhip, and who have no
thing to reproach ourfelveswith, as to them,
but too fond, toa blind an attachment. On
a calm retrofpeft of the condudt of your
illuftrions Predecessor, and a view of the
measures which have been pursued during
your administration with.regard to that na
tion, we can perceive nothing which ought
to have offended, nothing unattempted that
-cmiVrWjaTe averted tlte r2lamrty with which '
we are threatened, unless we had ehofen to
have become their ally in a war foreign to
our interests, and probably fatal to our in
dependency.
Anxious as we always have been, and (till
are, to avoid war, yet we are persuaded that
there is one evil greater and more dreadful,
national degradation, the certain harbinger
of flavcry. Accept then, Sir, ou/affurances,
as in some meafute representing our diftrift,
that yoih will find us animated with the
spirit of freemen, and determined at all
hazards to defend the rights and indepen
dence of our country, and if there be any
of a different sentiment, as hath been pre
sumptuously asserted, they will be found
few'indeqd.

ANSWER.
To the Jurors attending the Circuit Court of
the United States for the dijlria of Mary
land.
GENTLEMEN,
I THANK you for tin's address
The French revolution was a phenomenon,
so unusual in the modern history of the
world (although the changes of dynasties
were csmmon in the great empires of an
tiquity) and held up to our view in the
amiable light of reformation and regenera
tion, while its deformities were carefully
eoncealed from the public in America, that
it is. not surprising, that a new sera was
thought by many to be opening upon man
kind. It is now apparent to all men, that
slavery, rapine, and cruelty, have been aug
mented and multiplied, inilead of being suc
ceeded by liberty, justice and humanity.
I rejoice that your eyes are at length
opened ; the deadly blows aimed at the small
remains of republicanism in Europe, and the
menaces-os deftruflion against 11s, who have
nothing to reproach ourselves with, but too
fond,' too blind an attachment,>cannot fail
to alarm every candid mind.
The fatisfaftion you expref. in the con

Many strong indication* have escaped, from
time to time, for fevtral years; that nothing
would fatisfy the French rulers, short of our
becoming their ally iu a war, foreign to our
interest, and to our independence, by
becoming tributary to their ambitious views

TO THE PRZSIDFMT Of THE S NIT ED STATES.
SIR,
AT a moment when foreign d ingers threaten pur
peace, and when these dangers originate in an opin
â¢ icti that our government and our people are divfded
in Centiment, and opposed in interefL We, inhab
itants of the borough of Norfolk, feel ourfeJves im
pelled by every consideration of honor as men, and
integrity as citizens, to expfefs our ur.fhaken canfi.
dence in the measures of our govcrnmen'. and our
unimpaired attachment to the principles of our con
(Utution.
j In renewing those measures of our government,
which are the avowed caafes Of the unfriendly 90*1-
duÂ£fc which the French republic has pra&ifed towards
j us, we feel an honest pride in txprefftng our opinion,
f that impropriety or censure cannot juilly attach them
felvcs to those measures.
In examining the steps which have been pursued to
ob aia an amicable adjuftnsent of existing differences
we fee with pleafurea liberal, candid and fmcere dif
polition on the part of our government, to jelinquifh j
every secondary confid iaÂ»i 11 for the maintenance of
j peace ; we regret that those difpofrions have not been
i inc with sentiments equally pacific, with a temper
equally conciliatory aud accommodating on the part
or Trance.
While we avow the. friendly interest which we
have formerly taken in theaffairs of France, we rcj?&
with honest indignation her inadirtiflible demands;
we spurn with manly pride the imputations ot disu
nion and difaffe&ion to our government, on which
these demands were founocd.
We deprecate a war. as pregnant with evils to all
countries, and particularly inimical to the iQieiefls
of the United States \ but we arc at the lame time
determined nor ro purchase peace at the ppce of that
national chaia&fr and individual fecUrity. without
which peace ceases to be cither honorable or dpfira
ble.
While, therefore, we hope that a returning sense of
juftica and moderation on the p2rt of Fraece, will
terminate our disagreements by friendly explanation,
and honorable reparatfou; while we rely that our own
governmtnt will not cease to avoid war, by every
means confident wi'h our national honor, and com
patible with our national interest, we yet truÃ that
measures of defence will be immediately adopted, Sc
that our couutry will be prepared to meet every poffi
ble event.
Should these measures, defenfive in their nature, and
prompted by a neefflary regard to our unqueilionable
rights, be considered as indicative of a hofliledifpo
fition to the French republic, the governmarft of the
United States stands acquitted to its citizens and the
world. Providence alone can determine the issue.*
we pledge ourfeivesthat it will be fortunate 1q far as
our steady co-operation and support of the govern
ment can render it so.

From Amsterdam.
Capt. Elbridge, failed from that city
March which was before the New Eleft'

our Envoys had had, or Were like to have
an audience of the Directory. The free
election by the Citizens of Amjlirdarn, of
their Municipal Officers,had been set afideby
De la CrOix, the FrenchMmifter Pleoipo.
They were driven from their place of fitting
by a detachment of soldiers, and the crea
tures of the Minister placed in their (lead.
The people of Holland are extremely dis
contented with their si' nation.âExtraiS of

The Spanilh privateers, it was said, were
