OF R. AST APT.
| Rastadt so famous for its former,as well
j as its pending treaty, is in the Margravate
of Baden, whose t'ovfreign has rnlcd over it
above half a century, and is ranked amongst
the mod enlightened men of Europe. The
ftrongefl; proof of the excellence of his
head and heart is the love of his fubjedts,
who revere him as the father of their coun-
I try.
Though their territory touches upon the
Focus of revolution, thejMievfr have warp
ed from their allegiance. But on the con
trary every man took up arm. and rallied
round their sovereign, and laid their for
tunes at the foot of his throne, offering him
in advance any number of years, taxes he
chose to demand. But the generous prince
was touched at this aÂ£t : he gloriously re
fufed the offer by faying, that he was de
termiried to (land or fall with his peoplf, and
therefore his fortune was theirs, his life was
theirs, and he placed himfelf at their head,
and sent the hereditary princess and his grand
children out of the country.
The hereditary prince of Baden is marri
ed to a filler of the dowager queen of
fia. and is aunt to the king ; the priiicefs
had another marritd to the present emperor
of Rullia, bus who died. She has one
daughter married to the heir apparent of
the Ruffian empire, and her who is queea
of Sweden, and a third who is duchess of
Di-nx-Ponts, and whose consort is heir to
the two ele&oratea of Bavaria and the Pa
latinate.
Such love from the fubjedts, and such il
luflrious alliances are proofs of the moral
refpeftability of that house. But as strong
proofs of the moral and political venera
tion in which it is held are, that though
the French revolutionists had but to cross
the Rhine, and ravage the country, and
though they often pafled over it and pofleiT
ed it, yet they always refpefted in it the vir
tues of the house of Baden. The horrors <
of war filled the trenches of Khet with the
Aultn'ans. But the Margrave's fubje&s
were not wantonly or unnecefiarily made the
viftims of cruelty in any cafe, as far as was
general.y polfible in a state of war.
Carlfruhe, which is the residence of the
court of Baden, is Angular for it 3 plan. Its
form resembles that of an open fan : the
junction of the flicks being the situation of
the palace, whence all the ltreets dart out in ;
radii, and are interfered by semi circular
ones ; so that from the palace you can com- ;
mand a view of all the streets at once ; as <
from the centre of a semi circle you look i
along its different radii, and its circumfer- i
ence. And behind the palace there are ave- ;
nues cut through a sorest to correspond. i
The pace before the palace is bounded J ,
by a lonjf semi circular piazza : and the in- |
termediate space of about two or three hun r ;
dred yards wide, is occupied by the court i
yard and gardens, filled with orange trees ,
in summer.
There is beautiful scope of ground be- '
hind the pahce. laid out in a true English
style. And when under an unclouded Iky, ,
and surrounded by a solemn stillness, and
breathing all the perfumes of the East, I
have gazed around me, and then turned in
ward to tefledl upon the virtues of its prince
ly owners, I have frequently exclaimed to
myfelfâThis is a Paradise ! Heaven guard
it against a serpent.
As to the political consequence of the
Margrave, I refer you to Clark's Statistical
view of Germany.
WEXFORD,
Where the rebels were lately concentrated
in such force, is the capital of the country
of the fame nameâa sea-port town, situate
at the mouth of the river Slaney, eight
miles from the sea, 60 miles south fram
Dubliu, nearly opposite to St. David's in
Wales from whence it is distant about 65
miles, lat. 52 deg. 13 min. North ; it is
nearly three miles in length along the river,
population about 7,000 âit waj formerly
fortifiedâit was taken by Cromwell in the
civil wars, and dismantled, after putting the
inhabitants to the sword
Wexford was, as early as the year of 800,
a strong poll of the O jtmen, or Danes, from
whence they made' repeated sallies to the
annoyance of the interior country. It was
firft colonized by the English in 1172. It
was given by Dermot Mac Murtoch, king
of Leinfter, along with the two adjoining
Baronies of Bargie and Forth, at a marriage
portion with his eldest daughter Eva to-
Richard de Clare, Earl of Pembroke (fee
Lord Littleton's life of Henry lIJ. The
inhabitants of the town of Wexford, and the
two Baronies of Bargie and Forth, are a
diftinft class of people from the native, or
old Irish, as they have neither their lan
guage, manners, or cufloms. They speak
the language that Chaucer wrote in, and
have a strong rcfemblance in their habits to
the Saxons. The county of Wexford is
the belt cultivated part of Ireland, as the
Gentlemen owners of land always reside fln
their estates, which (tfpecially in the Bar
onies of Bargie and, Forth) never exceed
from 3001 to 5001. per annum, the whole
being divided is,to small farms, and in the
highest state of agriculture. Barley is the
pripcipal grain attended to, as the town of
Wexford is the principal port that supples
the Dublin market with malt, which is the
pri cipal export. There are more malt
houses in this town thaa there arc in any
othtrr in the kingdom.
When C romwell appeared before the
town, it was garrisoned by 50Q men, under
the command of Colonel Sinnot, who wan
ted to wait for succour from the Earl of
Cafllehaven, who was matching with aflitt
ance from Kilkenny ; but through the trea
chery of Stafford, the Lieutenant Gover
nor, Cromwell got admittance into the
town alter meeting with a spirited refin
ance, and put the garrison and inhabitant
totheiwoid; his lummons to Sirmot to
(urrender the town is preferred (framed and

NEW-YQRK, November ij.
To the Editor of the Daily Advertifcr.
Sir,
Sometime after jjiy arrival at thii p Dr t,
the following extrart was handed me by
one of my friends. It is in yonr paper
ofthe 10th ofAuguft lastâcopied from the
Salem Gazette :
"Salem, Auguftj.
" Wednesday arrived here the brig Ex
change, eapt. Richardson, 133 <hys. from
Batavia. On the izth July, was boarded
by the Englith letter ofmarque fchr. Chance
capt. 7 homas, 11 days from New-York,
bound to Martinique. He sent his boat
and took capt. Richardson on board, wi&
all his letters and papers, which he opened
and examined, ar.d told capt. Rhe should
carry him into Martinique where he expeft
ed he (hoald be able to condemn the cargo,
tho' there was no foundation for his expeft
ation. At 9 o'clock in the evening he reÂ«
turned capt. R- on board his own vessel,
ordering him to stand to the southward with
bim, and he would fend for him again the
next morning. At midnight capt. R. took
the liberty to wear ship and stand to the
northward, on which the Chance fired three
(hot at him, but did him no damage. Caot.
Thomas, kept several of the letters with him
which enclosed bills of exchange, but retur
ned the bills."
After perusing the above it would be disc
ficult to tell, whether astonishment or indig
nation were uppermost in my mind ; afton
ilhment at the effrontery, and indignation at
the ingratitude of Captain Richardson. Af
ter some rcfleftion, I think proper, 111 vin
dication of my conduct, to publish a true
statement of the tranfa&ion. It is true that
I boarded Capt. R. and demanded his pa
pers ; but after examining them and his let
ters I returned both, (with my permission
for him to proceed on his voyage) as I was
convinced, the vessel and cargo were Ame
rican property. I treated Capt. R. with
that civility which is due from one gentle
man to another, he was supplied by me
with several articles of which he waÂ« in
want, and in return for these favours he
presented me with a large jar of sweetmeats.
With to the guns which were fired,
they were private signals concerted between
a p.ize I had captured on my voyage, and
aiy own veflel. A few remarks on the very
accurate account, Captain R. gives of this
tranfadtion, will be fufÃcient to convince
every impartial man of its falfity. He fays,
I told him I expe&ed to condemn thj cargo
and ordered him to stand to the Southward,
at nine o clock in the evening, ill any
man believe if such had'been my expefta
tion, that I would have allowed Capt. R.
to go on board his vessel and take command
of her during the night, when accoiding to
every human probability he would have es
caped ? No man endowed with common
sense will believe it,' and no man but Capt.
R. would have published so lame an account.
With refpedi to the letters, likewise ; as no
rational creature afis without some motives
for his conduft, what, I would enquire, â¢
would have induced me to re'urn them and
detain the bil s of exchange ? or why after
such condu& on my part, did Capt. R think,
proper to make me a present of the fwect
meats as an acknowledgment of my polite
nef6 to him? To a person unacquainted with
human nature, Captain R.'s conduft would
appear incomprehensible, there may howe.
ver be fojie reasons assigned for it. His ,
vanity might htye been flattered by this ac
count, as it required both dexterity and cou
rage to tfcape an armed vessel, and his fear#
of deteftion might not have been great, as
it was improbable th&t the publication would
ever reach the author. But if be would be
advised by me, fov the future let him. be
more cautious, as falfhood is'generally de
te&ed and ingratitude foaner or later will
be punilhed.

PHILADELPHIA,
WEDNESDAY EVENING, NOVEMBER 14
s The whole of the present confufion and
i trouble of Europe is a barbarous attack on
: j the grand cement of civil society ; tie grand
: principl; that unites men in a social date,
} and carries them forward in a general coarse
' ps co-cptration for muHial cor.veni;:ncy and
| comfort. It is property, the meum and tuum,
that is the most general motive of human
aSions : It is the security of this that is the
j great end and bond of faciety. The co
j eliates of Europe, all civilized nations, had
I long gone hand in hand together, in the
; common paths of peaceful commerce : Even
1 in times of war, the dominion of morality

The rulers of France, with arms in their
3 hands, propose to make all othar nations
hewers of wood and drawers of water, and
that they themselves, like the ancient Ro
mans, shall live like sovereign princes. As
' the price of peace to peaceful cations, they
1 demand contributions for their own private
. date, as well as for the public revenue. In
' a word, other nations are to be slaves . the
I French, under the affedled name of citizens,
' are to be the only gentlemen l~~Phil. Ga%â¢

SEE THE LYON!
A curious Hibernian Lyon to be seen at
Verirennes in Vermont.
[Price two Mills.
This animal is said to be the mod curious
and extraordinary Bead ever seen in this
country. Thou,>h this is confidently asserted 3
to be the real Lyon, yet it is so far fro n
belonging to the noble African race, that S
it reftmbles them in nothing but the name.
He is said to rear much louder than the
Lion which was exhibited up and down
Coimefticut river thp year before lad; but t
in addition to li s roaring talents, he is said v
to have the faculty oÂ» Spittinr, fom which
circumdance naturalists aver, that he mull be t
of the mongrel breed, partaking in a very ji
considerable degree of the Tig.r or Cat
kind. -i
This is supposed to be the fame creature [.
that txpoftd himfelf to view the lad winter t
at Philadelphia, like a Monkey in all shapes f
to the infinite diversion of the public; win re ]
he wss taken the fame instant, for an Owl
by his fttipidity, for a Lamb by his pa i
ence, for a Cow by jÂ»iÂ«,courage, for an Ass
by his braying, for a Cur by his barking, v
for a Puppy by his-whining, for a Hog by t
his eating, for a Cat by his spitting, and v
for a Lion, by nothing but his being the p
greated of all beads.â He is a frightful a
looking animal, yet has never been found to c
be dangerousâfor in all pngnacularcocteds, t
which are his delight, he is generally quite 1-
tame, unless armed with a wooden sword ; c
being the fame that was flog'd ai Windsor. !
and can'd at Congress without any signs f
of resentment. He has, however, of late a
grown so reflive and troublesome, that hia ]
owners have thought fit to Cage him, where s
he may at any time be seen, by the curious r
in Beads, who all agree in his being the t
most extraordinary one ever exhibited.

The grateful Return. ;
A fubfeription has been opened at Savan- '

fering Poor in Philadelphia : The Editor â 
of the Georgia Gazette remarksâ" It in
peafing to be informtd, that force thousands
.of dollars, which remained undivided among
the fufferers by the fire here in 1796, will
be most cbearfully relinquished 'in favoj of
the Philadelphians, accompanied with a de

immediately."
COMMUNICATION.
In the military parade of this forenoon
every thing would have been highly pleasing
and interetting, but for one reflection which
irrefidibly stole upon the minds of thr
fpedlators, viz. that a large majority of the
charadters who were presenting their re
fpedts to :he 1 llustrious Chief, differed
, widely from him in political sentiments }
efp:-cially as to the occ fton of this â¢warlike
preparation I This idea struck a damp upon
â¢ the fatisfaftion which otherwise would have
been excited by the survey of such a scene
of mingled patriotism and gratitude. Let
the officers of the Philadelphia brigade of
1 militia, who are confpicuovis for perfjnal
1 bravery and (kill, refltdl .up n tis lament
-1 .ille truth; and while admiring the virtues
and dignity of th:-ir Leader, operate on
- their minds a coincidence of feirtiment a d
condudt Then wiil these public difplayi
be accompanied with public admiration and
applause.
