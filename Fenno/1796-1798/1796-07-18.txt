Mr. Fenno,
*MANKiNDÂ» in the abftoce of greater evils,
have always been acctiftomed to complain of those
which are trivial in their nature, and which would
scarcely attract their notice if they were not renÂ»
dercd confpieuous by coming alone. Even where
real evils do not exist, the imaginations of some
â will be busy in forming gloomy prognoftieations,
and their Abilities exerted in spreading diltruft
through society.
â¢ To this dHpofition of human nature to repine at
their condition, however enviable, we may justly
attribute the murmurs of some of our citizens, at
the present time of unexampled prosperity. Here â¢
are the United States risen to independence and re
r Butation, and favored with peace, liberty and plen
iv. apatriotifm mull:'
turn aside from these blefling*,to WfanWTTfie de
fers of government ! America, having refilled
the heavy arm of opprefiion, havings baffled the
fchemcs of insurgency, and disarmed by her placid
dignity the malice of distant nations, is now doom
ed to bt peflered with the effufions .of calumny,
and the lamentation! of counterfeited sorrow.
To'him, however, who conliders human frailty,
this circumstance will not oe'eafion much surprize;
nor, when he examines into its nature and cause,
will it rouse his apprehensions. No system of go
vernment ci>h be formed fa free from error, as not .
to present forih: opening to the of discon
tent; nor-, indeed, would perfeAion-ilfelf fare any
better wilh these who are determined on diflatis'fac
-tion, and continue their censures, rather to che
rish animosity than to effedt j-eformation.
But why lhould these clamours disturb us ? The
evil may be truly said to bring its own rÂ«nedy.
By bringing-political fubjedts so frequently into dif

them,*a{ii"lead us by freqnent alarms to study our
feeurity withmorecircumfpeÂ£ioii. Letnot therefore
tbefrienas of good government be difconcertcd by
the voice of those who delight to vilify & counteract
' It. '
Much has been said about the propriety oF our '
fidirig with certain foreign nations. For my part,
" 1 fee no reason to meddle with the concerns either ;
Â«f England or France, further than to demand
jullicfcfrom both. As to the opinion of our par
tiality for the former power, it is.'too absurd to de- ,
Terve refutation, though there are many, that pro- ,
fefsto hold it. France, it is true, may claim some
/hare of oucxegard, but cannot we (hew it with
out giving up our Independence to her, as some
would have it 1 I am well aware that we are bound
in frieudlhip to the French nation, but these liga
ments extend only to the mutual interests of the
two nations, and embrace nut the internal policy of 1
either. Was it ever intended by the compact be- i
tween us, that one (hould make the cause of the 1
other her own, and hold herfelf obligated to join in '
her vengeance? If so, the two nations are but I
one; and let them hereafter be ruled by one head, I
since they can by this means operate with greater '
force, and plan their enterprizes with more uni- I
fortuity. <
Bits taking these people on their own ground, 1
and allowing it is incumbent on us to help Fraiace '
in their present difficulties, by what means are wÂ«
"to do it ! Go to war with her enemies ? No, furs
ly ; if the wisdom of France is equal to her hero- (
ism, (he will easily fee that the aid of America has 1
been more effc&ually drawn forth by her obferv- :
ance of impartial deportment, than if het govern- t
ment had been inspired with the fame spirit of re- c
fer.tment that enflamed themselves. She has fur- ,
nifhed them with food, without which the fire of
enthusiasm i> fuffoeated, and the force of armies i
depressed. By this line of condtift substantial fu:- j
â¢ours ha*Â« been given ; and who that withes well j
to the cause of France, would be anxious, lather t
to gratify them with useless anger at their enemies, t
than to pursue those lleps by which.alone we c
qualified toaffift them ?
WitlrrelpeA to our treaty with Great-BritaiWj %
concerning which the minds of men have nat yet 1
become calm, much has been said and written t
-perhaps more than its oppofers are willing or' able p
examine. 1 (hall therefoie forbear to-dwcll up- x

8 cagnoniers assembled on the day appointed ; and
, tlie light hotfe, and the reft of the militia were or-
k > 'dered to surround them in order to disarm them. a

The firft was in December 1779, and related to <1
the then ilate of thc-country during the American in

; pointmcnt of a Comraiffion of Accouifis, formei' a
of independent ,ger.Ueman, both in "fortune and rr

ana particularly recommended the pei'ufal of the h

ie, Mtdui, they would by no means think it dry read- r
3 ; ing, and they certainly would d#ive from.it a very h
if. considerable degree of the mJ ufeful and import-* a
la* ant information. His Lord(hip said, that it was a
in- not his wilh in what was about to prop.ife, to h
lay any direÂ£l charge of blame or accusation aÂ«-ainft v

quefled their Lordftlip's attention to the second ; d

â r, ints one was pSrticulnrly recommended. This p
â k would have gone, if adopted, to the abolition of t
>11, fifteen places with the "falarics annexed, out of five t
bn and twenjy. His Lordlhip then referred to the c
:-x- ninth report, which'flrlated to the payment of the Â«
iys army, in which he said it was pointed out the great- b
20 eft confufion prevailed. The Commiffiorrrrs had \
eft said that it ought to.be reduced loHwo heads, Sub- 1<
fillence and Arrear â , instead ef which, there were b
es payments to the right and to the left, forward and e

by ealy to fee for what mode was adopt- ft
X y Â«dâto answer the views of Minders, and let the t]
ltd public fee the fityarion they were in as little aspof- p
(ible. His Loridjltij then adverted to the tmfu .d a

in. the I>th report, and to extraordinaries of the ar- si

Having -requeued their Lordlhips' attenxioii to thefc k;
.ffvjral points, particularly liptifed in the reports *co
of the Commillioners ps Accounts,- he. next pro- eri
needed to,animadvert on various irieafures adopted on
and pursued by adminiftralipn, which he divided dil
into twd hrads, viz. those undertaken without con- bi
sent of Parliament, ami thdfe in which they had G'
that confeut. Of the firll class, he began by no- til
ticing the appointment of a third"Secretary of re
State, a measure which, in his mind, wis no only \i,
totally unnecelVary, hgst which was dirc&ly in the :l
face of an Aft of Parli merit pr.fle 1 for tjhe re. ci

peculiar ('ury it was to fee to, and t* eonltpul the so
expenditure of every (hilling. He entreated their ti
Lordships particular attention to what Mr. Hatfell n
had so ably and intelligently wrote tVn this head,' h
and said he waiud forgive.all those newspapers which, h
pretended to principle, all.the ttonfenfe they might; si
put into his mouth as having said, if they wouldl (1
but print and reprint what Mr Hatfell had writteti '1
in so true and malteily a maru.ei : alluring the h
tioiilc, that'in thole pralft's (:Â« beftowild op the x
work he was actuated by rio ofhet motives whiter

t Lordthip then came to those tneafurei which had 1

f he mentioned was, the India bill, which he cal'ed 1
. an enotmous mountain of influence ; a huge s wide' (

1 would footi be the only object of a library, and pa- |

, should have gfÂ»Â¥n'his'opabfnion to it. Tins bill, Â«
he understood, was (h.ortly to come before the house t

: IV. The names of the Subscribers ihall be prefixed,
The following Chara&er of this work
j is extraflcd from the Monthly Review, p 311, 31a, for
March, 1793.
" We have no small degree of pleasure in announcing
the present work to ou'r readers ; as one which from the
freedom of its enquiry, the,g;randeHr qf its,views, and the
; fortitude qf is eminently deferying of atten
tion. By this eulogium, wc would by no means be under
stood to fubferibt to Ml the principles which tKefe volumes
contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived at that degree of
certainty which is re<iuifite, for any two men to think a
like on all lubjecU; neither has langpage.attained that con
fident accuracy, which can enable them to convey their
[thoughts, even when they do thinkaiilae, in a manner pei-
I CeSly correA and intelligible to both. These difficulties
i re only to be overcome by a patient, incefiant, and bene
volent inVeftigatian.
" Many qf the opinionswhich this work contains, are
'bold; some of them are novel; andfomcdoubtlefsare er
roneous : âbut that which ought to endear it even to those
jphofe principles it may offend, is the strength of argu
ment adduced in it to prove, that peace and"order molt ef
fectually the happiness after which political re
formers ate panting ; âthat as the progress of knowledge
is g radual,,political reform ought not to be precipitate ; â
and that eotrvulfive violence is dangerous not only to indi
viduals (for that result comparatively would be qf small
account) but, to the general cause of truth. It is the op
posite ef this principle that inspires the enemies of politic
al enquiry with so much terror ; it is the supposition that
change must inevitably be attended by the turbulence and
injustice of commotion; and that innovation cannot be
made without the interven-ion of evils , more deftru&ive
than those which are intended to be reformed. Under the
cor.vision of this philanthropic fentimcnt, of calm and
gradual reform, (which in its proper place he has fully il
lustrated) Mr. Godwin proceeds without scruple firft to en
quire into present evil, through itseffential branches, and
next to demoHftrate future good.
" Dividing his work into eight books, and making thi
IMPORTANCE PJ POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS the fubjejl of
the flrfl, he begins by an attempt to prove, th/ omnipo
tence of government over the moral habits of mankind ;
and that on these moral hafcits their wisdom, virtue and ,
felicity depend."
