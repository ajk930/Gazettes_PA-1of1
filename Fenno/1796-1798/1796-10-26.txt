Nat to your sentiments as a man, but to your

insertion of the following :

. ' This curious dream came in my head,
That a mod'rate man appeared,
'â  â  ââ  âââand said,
three If Mr. JefFerfon is elected Piclident of the Uni
ted States, all the present ofii;ers of government
will be put out of office. Perhaps Burr vijll fill
the place of Pickering, as secretary of state, and
the 18 virtuous Virginians will canvas for the other
vacant offices. Pinckney will lie recalled from
France, and Mason (that treaty hero) will be fub
ivith ftituted. In J 5 months we will be involved in a ru
inous war, which will terminate in the fall of the
present fabric of gbvernmeut, and a disunion of the
Gates. In the mean time, every Frenchman in
America will become a pensioner. On the other

Trarjlalcd for the Minerva. I
j BRUSSELS, Sept. rz.
The retreat of the army of the Sambre and I g n
Meufe, under gen. Jourdan, is more serious and de j
ciftve, than it was at firft thought to be. The re- â
publicans being eonftantly purftied and attacked by ( '
an enemy of superior force, have been compelled to I â
fly in a hurry, that they were obliged to leave j ~
artillery, baggage, and in particqlar ah amaxing I
I number of killed and prisoners behind them. The j
I word yet remains. The different columns of ge- i
neral Jourdan's army had to aÂ£l separately in a
country which is .divided into narrow passes, and
I thus every one was separately worded in a dreadful
I manner. In such a preiling fitualion a decided part j
I was to be taken, in order to save the remains of
I the army, and therefore gÂ«n. Jourdan gave orders! Anc
I to all these columns to rendezvous on the right bank
los the Mein. The ftaff of said array was already
Jat Frankfort on the sth inft. and also troops at or '
j about that city entirely worn down fey fatigue and I
I hardships, and most part without clothes and Ihoes. |
j These troojjs-arriving in great disorder it is to b<
J inferred that the misfortune of the republican ar
rhe \m7 be very considerable. All the baggage
I and artillery of reserve is to be sent to Limburg I
in-J HQ 'he Labn, whil/l the army will choose a good I Sil.
vi. I Hand behind the Mein, where they will wait for the
m . numeiuws reinforcements which are sent to (hem â- L
C( j I from all parts. I
, a In the mean time, the imperialists are filing down
,M the river with a considerable force, and if they aic So
h e J not arrested in their career by unforefeen events, it j parte
;es is to be apprehended, the army of gen. Jourdan
Tlt will be obliged to re-cross the Rhine. Gen. Mo-1 ?!'
S, I 'Â«Â» will also have to fall back to prevent his left A;
il. Wing being surrounded by the imperials, and an Di
N . attack m the rear. The greatest part of the troops M
ot beficgirg thefortrefs Â«f Ehrenberitftein are ordered
lis f"" 0 " 1 th "e towards the Mein and very few sent to V .

their hospitals, and that the roads are covered with
