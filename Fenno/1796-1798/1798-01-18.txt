PHILADELPHIA,
THURSDAY EVENING, JAMJART 18.
SCIPIOâN Â». X.
RELATIVE to the sam of mortev which it wai
proootcd thai the Uaitcd Stales fhoold iend tÂ« France
to enable it to profrcute the war, it Ihould be re
member ei the projeS was by Mr. Mon
â¢ roc at a time when under ltd possible cucunaftancei it
could have beei* prpper. The iatirm with G.
Bri'.a o was then pending. If it succeeded, prace
with thai naiioo would hiwe beert corÂ»iirurd ind the
loÂ»n would have* ben a violation of neutrality not to
be juftififd. If it fai'iwl, war with Great Britain
muA have been the consequence, and all our moÂ»Â»ey
and rcfourees would have been in our su.n
har.di. Why then did ouj Min'fter, though oil erwifr
intruded J>y the Frrfidcnt, give a p!ai< for obtaining
5 the loan, bis aid to the Frrnch msnifter, and
write to tk Seeu'wv of State that the peotde wou d,
io his opinion, cheerfully bear a tax that fhou'd mif#
money for theFiench. He ouzKt to have recollected
how those who concurred With him in politics ever
have been and areoppofed to all plans of railing reve
nue* to be applied to the support of the general gov
ernment: how a cerain ciafa, called annfederahlls,
democrats, or jacobins, the French fac
tion, have labored i 'Ctffantly to render the adminif.
i tratian of the government odious to the people, and
with how much difficulty revenue laws havo been
pasTed for raiting the monies nec (Tary to discharge
our revolution-debts, and tw uphold the present sys
tem of the Union. Rccolle&ing these thangs, it is
tltnoA, but not quite, unaccountable that he should
have thought the people of the United States would
i have "paid a tax cheerfully ta raije a sum for the French
i _ Treasury, relying on a mere promise of France to reimburse
the loan, if pojjible, at fumt future day." Did he really
i believe the people would pay taxes for France mo't
1 cheerfully than for themselves, or was it ihe phrerzy
! of a distempered mind ? He could not, in fobcrfenfe
have believed it. His countrymen were never nor
are they yetdifpofed to be tributary to the French re
| public or to any foreign nation in tbe Universe. It is
true their patience under the many injuries and indig
nities which have been accumulated on them, has |
been wonderful. If it has been minterpreted for
I pusillanimity, or for exceflive fondnefa for the French
republic, the delusion cannot much longer remain :
and when it thai 1 be removed, and the rulers in
France (hall l?arn by experience the real temper of
this country, and feel its courage, they will view
with con erapt the men who, having deceived and
disappointed them, at length produced a lading ftfpa
ra ion between the two nations ; the men who, frnf
ftra ed in the Jchemc of lacking the United Statei as a pro
vince to the French Republic, for their felhfh pur pole, of
ambition or avarice, shall, if thought of at all in A
merica, be thought of with abhorrence.
The documents published by Mr. Monroe, as well
as his own narration of his minifiry, furnifh another
instance in which his condu& appears highly cenfura -
ble. He neglefled for a long time to slate and urge with
finceiity and prudence to the Directory of France the argu
ments of the Executive with zvhich he had been furni{k d>
proving thai the treaty with Great-Britain was not inconjift
ent with our treaty with France, and did not proceed jiom
any motives unfriendly to France, as had been wickedly mij
reprefented on both fides the Atlantic.
There is a fort of people who are indebted for the
notice which the public on them, prin
cipally to the malignant hatred which they have uni
formly declared agbinft Great-Britain. A person of
this defcriptiun cannot be expe&ed to be reconciled to
our treaty with that nation, because that inUrument
not only prevented a war with that nation, but is
likely long to prevent one. Mr. Monroe, lam lure,
will igloi y tn the reputation of hating Britain aud loving
France, which he has taken r o much paina to acquire.
I mention this as it will serve to explain the line of
conduit, which the Documents prove he observed up
on the fubjett of the British treaty, and when it is ie
membered that he hated Britain even with Gallic hat
red, it njuft have becu natural to him to entertain a
cordial wish that the treaty should excite the resent
ments of France, and by some means or other be de
feated or annulled. Besides. he has informed the
community that heforefaw in the faring, 1795, if ibe
treaty was raliist-d he would prc4>Â»bty be re-cHJed," k?
that the treaty mufl have been peculiarly odious to
him for this expected consequence. (page go.)
For fubftantiaiing this charge of raifeonduct, it is
necrfTary to refer to the documents. Mr. Monroe,
in his letter to the Secretary of State, datedjÂ»7th Au
gust, 1795, which is the fiift he wrote after the trea
ty was known at Paris, informed the Secretary, *'that
within a few days pad, Philadelphia pap.-rs were re
ceived as late as the 3d of July, containing Mr. Jay's
treaty, together with such proceedings of the Senate
upon it as were then published, Â£cc Of late I have
heard nothing from the Committee on this fubjeÂ£l y nor do 1
expeQ to hear any thing from thatb:dy upon it, let the im
pression be what it may, otherwise than tn r ply to such com
munication ai 1 may make thereon, and refpefting which, it
may be proper to add, that I Jhalltake no flep without your
particular mflrudion."
In the lame letter he fays, " As I have had
no communication with this government upon
the fubjÂ«<st of this treaty since its contents were
known, it isofcourfe impoflible for me to fay
what the impression it has made is. It is easy
for you with the lights you haw, to form a
correal opinion upon that point io Philadelphia,
He afterwards mentioned that he heard an ob
jetftioti was made by many to that part of the
18th article which related to proviiions; and this
is the only objection it appears had then been
brought forward, (page a&6 j
V\ hat I have quoted of this fetter fliould nev
er be forgot ift. It by proves hia own acknow
ledgement " that he did not expert to hear from
the committee but in reply to such communica
tions as he should make refpc&ing the treaty/'
and yet he has offered to juftify his tile nee on this
fubjes,by fcyiugr 4 * he deemed it improper to
make any communications to the dire&ory, till
they presented their complaints." adly. That
at the firft appearance of the treaty, no objection
was made except relative to one article, which
in practice has not been detrimental to either
France or the United Stite?, and is not there
tore complained of by anybody at this day.â
3dly. That there <were lights at Philadelphia by
which Mr. Randolph might discover how the
treaty would be received at Paris: In other
words, that whatever objections should be made
by the French faction here, might be expc<fted
to be made in France.
On the 10th of September 1795 i be aga n
wrote to the Secretary of State, and recom
mended if any further negotiation should bene
ceflary Vith Great-Britain, that the* person em
ployed should pofTtis the confidence of France,
and (hould carry on the negotiation where the 1
Frenchjhould be negotiating on peace, either at
Paris or Bajle. Further, he pointed out the '
way of engaging the of the French republic
by adopting the projedl of a loan, by attacking
Canada and fining out privateers. It cannt t
escape Dotire, on reading this letter, bow anx
ious oor mtuifter wasj}*t fll further negotiation
with Britain should be cor.du&ed by us under
the eye of France. In this letter no mention is '
j made that he had heard any complainrs against
the treaty â(pace aio) ânor dots his next let
ter, dated 4th contain any idea con
cer,. og the treaty â(page 113).
Or ihe aoth O&ober 1795, Mr. Monrr>e ac
knowledged the receipt of fcveral letters from
the Secretary of State, dared 29th IVJav, jftand
7th June, Â»(!, Bth, 14th, aift, 29th and ?6th Ju
ly- Several of these letters related to the Brit
iih treaty, particularly that of the ift June,
which is very lengthy, (consisting of 26 pages
of the book) and contained the eiott ample in
formation and meft copious arguments relative
to the conduct of the Uni cd States in making
the treaty ; and that of 14th July, accompanied
his correfpnndence with Mr. A**rt. They vi ere
intended to enable our minister to answer all the
OltyclUoiaft thai mijVw be luggefted or made bv (

that is to f;y in December t?94.
e On the itt!> September 1795, the Secretary
e of State, Mr. Pickering, wrote a letter ejcpl*in
-0 inc to Mr. Monroe fl.e propriety pi lihe KritiQi

" To the Legislature Â«/ Pennsylvania.
y A petition lias lately been laiJbefore you,
" praying for a grant of money to finirfi the
'* building adjoining the Pennfylvauid Hafpi
tal which is intended for the reception of
persons deprived ot their reafrtn.
s To induce you to comply with the priyer
e of that petition, the folio wing'thought 5 are
- humbly suggested to your consideration.
I. The obligation to aiSs of juftiee and
J humanity, arc equally binding upon states |
and individuals. A man might as well sup
. pose by changing his place of abode, he
, was released from paying his debts, or from
f giving charity to the poor, as suppose by
1 becoming a member of a public body, he
was exempted from the great and universal 1
_ law of benevolence. Governments were j 1
, instituted not only to prevent andpunifh evil, 1 ;
r but to do good. Their objects are therefore <
- but partially fulfilled, when rulers negledt
- to lessen human miferv, by direst aÂ£ls of le- <
' giflation. <
2. Lunatics or persons deprived of their I
reason, have the flrongefl claim upon our
. pity and humanity, of any obje&s of mi- 1
. fery. They are not only unable to help, but 1
1 they discover a disposition to deflroy them
â¢ selves. They often diilurb the peace of
focitty, and sometime* make attempts upon
the lives of their ne2reft relations. Even
the dead are not always secure frem their
outrages ; hence many instances have oc
curred of their leaping over Ute eiiclbfures
of burying grounds, and tearing open
graves in order to revenge supposed injuries
upon their former friends.
3. Consider, that your children may be
fubjeft to this terrible and distressing mala
dy in common with the reft of mankind,
and that by completing the building for the
reception of lunatics, you raay lay a foun
dation for the accommodation and cure of
some of your posterity.
4. All phyficiaos agree, that the firft
thing to be done for the cure of mad per
sons, is to separate them from thfir relati
ons. This can never be done to advantage <
by placing them in a private family. In all i
countries, Hospitals and mad houses have
been found necessary for this purpose. The <
unfinifhed building which now solicits your
aid, will have every possible advantage for i
the government, comfort and cure of the *
: persons who shall be admitted into it.
1 5. Madness in its recent state, has lately V
become a curable disease, provided the sub- '
, jeÂ£ts of it are placed in a situation in whieh {
r an easy but steady government can be efla- c
[ blifhed over them. This can only be done
: in a Hospital appropriated to that purpose.
To refufeXo complete such a hospital, is to
. counteraft the discovery of the remedies
for madness, and to perpetuate and extend
that disease throughout the state.
6. The hospital which now implores your
â¢ relief, is ealculated to render benefits to ev
-1 erypart of the state. A great proportion
of the lunatics now confined there, were
. sent from the different counties of Pennfyl-
I vania.
7. Considerâthat the credit of our in
: fant republic is deeply interested in the suc
cess of the application for money which has ;
lately been made to you. In all the great j
cities of Europe travellers are dire&ed to
behold and admire the humanity of kings
in the establishment and endowment of lu
natic hospitals. Let it not be said, that
kings love and pity their fubjefts, more

The foregoing items are an outline of the
r plan which appears to your committea high
. ly necessary, lo prevent the j'ntrodu&ion and
propagation of pestilential and contagious Â»
diseases.
; _ To an enlightened and humane legislature
it must be an adt of fupererogatioo to rcfort
1 to argument to enforce the propriety andu
s tility of efficient provisions. When the
1 scenes of horror and distress, which exhib
ited themselves in this city and its environs
r in the year 1793, and the late autumn are
- called up to the recolleaion, humanity will
j permit but one opinion in the House, and
1 that is, to afford an ample and complete re
. medy against future calamities.
Such must be the jbft conceptions of the
. legislature, that any endeavour to prove the
- correspondence of interests between the city
s j and country, would be as fuperftous as an
t attempt to demonllrate the truth of a felt
j evident proportion. Every man, wliofe
s mind is not blinded hv prejudice, must. ad
- mic that whatever relates to the interest of
I the one has a correspondent relation to the
e interest of the other, and thit like members
. of the fame body, the sympathy is mutual
and the wants and interefta reciprocal. Im
pressed with these sentiments, your commit
tee feel authorised in urging aii attention to
supplying the city with pure water, as of
primary importance to its health, as well
as to its comforts. Although your com-
V'' tf.rf â ' n {' .â¢-* after the
mod attentive investigation, that the disease
which ravaged in this city and its suburbs
in the year 1793, and the late autumn was
of fereign origin, they neverthclefs believe,
that there exiftei at those periods a certain
condition of the atmosphere which favoured
its propagation, and without which it conid
not have been -transmitted to any alarming
extent. It being a desideratum, tnat such
a (late of air (hould be counterafted which
affords nutriment to contagion, they cannot
too ftrongty inculcate the neceluty of a sup
ply of pure water to the city, and of tne
(triaeft attention to such regulations as will
keep it ar.d environs free from putrefaaive
substances.
To arrest the ravages of disease and death,
to rescue our city from desolation, a certain
: copfequence of one or two more Yellow Fe.
r ver visitations, to keep up the importance
. and commerce of the State, which are intiÂ»
. mately involved in the prosperity of the cap: ;
- tal, some efficient system is abfoiutc'.y nece'.-
r fary. The foregoing outline is fubiaittea
1 with deference, and when your committee
: consider, that interest, prompted Ly human
- ity and every virtuous fteling of ihe iieart,
J urge the interference of the legiGature, t0.,,
e cherifti a doubt of that interference, wou.il
betray as much inhumanity, as would a
f pathy to so intereiting a fubjea. .
Impressed with the importance mag

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
WEDNESDAY JANUARY 17.
Mr. Macon, from the Committee of Re
vifal and Urfitiifhed Business, made a re
port on the motion referred to them on the
4th instant refpe&ing the abolition of the
office of commissioner of the Revenue, which
stated it as their opinion, that it would be
inexpedient to abolifi) that office.
The report having been reaÃ a second,
time,
Mr. Macon moved that the house concur;
but Ms. J. \yilliammoving that it be com
mitted, the ferilF of the house was taken
upon the question, and it was negatived.
Mr. Macon then renewed his motion to
concur. He said that the committee were
unanimous in their opinion that this office
was necessary. It was the duty of the
Commissioner of the Revenue to fuperintenj
the duties colledled from impost and ton
nage, and from internal revenue. He had
also to examine all the accounts fettled by
the Auditor. The light houses, beacons
and public piers were under his direction;
he bud also to affiftin preparing statements
for the two houses of Congress, and a good
deal of mifcellaneout business, as the Secre
tary of the Treasury had the power of giv
ing him f&ch business as he thought proper.
He had also to covrefpond with all the fu
rv'rriforl of the different dates on the fub
jeÂ£t of Internal revenue, which correfpond
?nce was very considerable. He did not
think there would be any economy in put
ting more business upon any department than
it would well perform: and if this office
were abolished, the business of it must be
done by another. It might be said that by
acMiug tie ffUrWo employed in this office to
another of the Treatcrry ofku.., tim uÂ»fiâl
ness might be as well donej but he concei
ved the expence thus saved, which would
not be more than 700 dollars a year, as a
principal clerk must be employed, would be
equal to the loss of responsibility which
tJhe public had in the commissioner of the re
venue. Mr. M. thought to objeCt to an
office of this fort was draining at a gnat.
He was as great a friend'of curtailing theex
pences of Government, as any member;
but there were other expences which carried
off the money of Government, and which
ought to b? lessenedâthis office he believed
to be necefiary.
Mr. Findiey hoped the report would be
agreed to. The original intention of this
Â«ffice was to be a check upon the other of
ficers of the Treasury Department. He
did not wifli it, therefore, to be abolished;
but, at another time, he trusted, the busi
ness of it would be revised. If the house
were disposed to take away all checks of
this kind, they might go on and abolifli
the offiee of comptroller general and others.
He was not disposed to give up these
checks.
Mr, J. Williams was of opinion that all
the business done by this officer might be
done by an additional clerk in the comp
troller's office. He did not think the res
ponsibility of this officer was so great as re
presented, as he was under the dire&ion of
the Secretary of the Treasury. By such a
regulation, he believed, one third of the
expence now incurred would be saved; and
and though another gentleman might not
think a saving of 3 or 4000 dollars a year
an wbjedt, he was of a different opinion.
The report was concurred in.
The report on tbÂ« petition of Stephen
Sayre was committed for to-morr&w.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
chims, made an unfavourable report on the
petition of Joh* Carr, which was commit
ted for to morrow.
The following message was received from
the President of the United States: ;
Gentlemen of the Senate, and 1
Gentlemen of the Jioufe of Reprefentaiives, '
THE situation of affairs between the U
nited States and the cherokee nation of In- <
dians, having evinced the expediency of a :
treaty with that nation, for the promotion t
of Justice to them, as well as of the interests 1
and convenience of our citizens, I have no- \
minated, and- 4>y-and and a
consent of the Senate, appointed comiffion- t
ers, to hold conference and conclude a *
treaty as early as the season of the year and 1
the convenience of the parties will admij. r
As we know very well, by experience, I
that such negociations cannot be carried on e
without considerable expences, I reCom- b
mend to your confederation the propriety of 1
making an appropriation, at this time, for n
defraying such as may be necefiary for h
holding and concluding a treaty. h
That you may form your judgment with e
greater facility, 1 shall direst the proper of- q
ficer to lay before you an estimate of such w
articles and expences as may be thought in- tl
dispensable. tl
J6HN ADAMS. n
United States, 1 ai
January 17th 1798 j p
Mr. N. Smith moved that this message E
be referred to the' committee of ways and fa
-.means. ai
Mr. Harper did not fee the propriety of p:
this reference : he thought it would be bed ri
to go to the committee of the whole who m
had the report as the feleft committee upon ol
the petition and remondrance of the legifla- S
ture of Tennefiec under consideration. li
Mr. N. Smith could fee no reason why a I u<
different course /hould be observed with res- d;
pedl to this business, than was observed with tu
refpeft to any other which related to appro- of
priatic-HÂ»&, and the usual way was to refer tfi
all fnch fubje&s to the committee of ways he
and means. The present, he said, was mere ri l
Executive business. The, President of the w;
United States had communicated to the he
House his intention of holding a treaty and on
requested.an appropriation. It was, there- tri
.ore, a proper fubjc?t to be ailed upon by ze
he committee of ways and means ; and, tic
vhen it was so referred, he (hould move to cu
lifcharge the committee of the whole from T<
(he Farmer confidirationof tbebufinefs which
related to this treaty. The House had al
ready spent confiierable time upon it to no
f â¢ purpose, merely because it was [improper
for them to have entered upon it at all.
Mr. J. Williams believed it was usual for
e_ all messages from the President of the U.
'e- States to be referred to a committee of the
he whole on the date of the Union. |He wished
he this message to take that course, and wjien
ch the promised estimates were received, they
be could be the fame committee.
Mr. T. Claiborne approved of the course
ad recommended by thegentleman from S. Ca
rolina.
r; Mr. Thatcher thought nofreference was
necefiary, until the estimates were received.
cn Mr. Nicholas did not undtriland what
gentleman from Connecticut meant by
to faying that this was wholly executive bu
re sines. He did not believe, because the Pre
ce fident had told the lioufe that he was about
hq to hold a treaty, that the money must be
granted, and that the House had no choice
n- whether they would appropriare it or not.
id From what had already been said upon the
>y fubjeel, he doubted not there was a pretty
us general dipofition to grant the money ; but
n; it was not proper that the message
ts be sent to the committee of ways and means,
id as if an appropriation was a thing of course;
e- to do this, would be to aft at the command
v- of the President of the United States ;â 
r. whereas that House could only a& upon
u- the full exercise of its'difcrrtioir. He, there
b- fore, moved that the message be referrtdto the
d- committee of the whole which had already
at this fubjeft under confideratiou.
t- Mr. Harper was- of opinion with the
in gentleman from Cannefticut to a certain ex- j
;e tent. If the expence to be ptovided 1
je I for was of a nature that might be dispensed I
>y with, or not, it might b'- proper to fend
to the message to the committee of ways and
râ meallTtoFtheir report thereon, as to its ex
i- pediency ; but the present was an e&p&QSX-
Id that could not be avoided, and he did not fee
a what the committee of ways and mpans
>e could do upon the fubjeft.
:h Mr- Gallatin believed the.gentleman from
e- Connecticut had not eonfidered this fubjeft
in with his usual correftnefs. That gentle
t. man had said that the message before them
s- ought to go to thg committee of ways and
p; means, and that an appropriation would fol
d low as a thing of course. It must be known
h that this was contrary to the pra&ice of that
d house or of any former legislature ef the
United States. On the contrary, it was
ic usual, firft to authorize an expence, and in
is the next place to appropriate, and in no
f- cafe had the business been reversed. If the
e message were referred to the committee of
[; ways and means, all they could do, would
i- be to bring it back to the house, and ask
e for an authority for the expence. He be
>f lieved the gentleman from Conne&icut had
h been led into this mistake by eonfidering
i. the message announcing the intention of the
e President to bold a treaty, as a treaty made,
aud, had that heen the cafe, according to <
11 that gentleman s known opinion, he would
e consider the house as bound to make th<? -we- J
- eefiary appropriation ; but he desired him ,
.- to recolleft that no treaty was yet made, 1
- and, therefore, that doftriue could not ap
f ply in the present cafe. The message might
a indeed be referred to a feleft committee ; '
e that an opinion might be reported whether .
i the expence ought to be authorized ; but, i
t as the fubjeft had already been before the ]
r house, and, though there was a differente 1
of opinion as to the mpde of effedling the
business, there seemed to be but one fenti- j
1 ment that something ought to be dene ; he t
thought it best to refer the message to a :
f committee of the whole, where he sup- Â®
' posed there would be no objection to the
- g rant ' n g of a sum of money for the pur- [
pose iri view.
1 Mr. N. Smith did not know that it was f
a matter of much importance whether the 1
message was referred to a committee of the f
whole, or the committee of ways and means 1
but he was not yet convinced that it "
ought no* to go to a committee of wavs j
and means in preference to a committee of p
the whole. The gentleman from S. Caro- p
lina (Mr. Harper) did not know that there S
was any thing that tha -committee of ways t
and means could do in the business. He '
thought there were many fads which it "
was necessary to enquire into ; such as what j,
would be the probable expence of the com- !â 
miffioners, of convening the Indians, &c. c
Matters of faft might be readily ascertain- a
ed by that committee, but which could not 0
be determined in a committee of the whole. a
That this was the ordinary course of bufi-
nefj could not be denied. The President
had informed the house he was about to t<
hold a treaty (whether with a foreign pow- h
er, or with the Indians, was of no confe- *
quence) and that certain fnmi of money l '
would be necefiary, and he believed no gen-
tleman could point out an instance, where
this hid been done, that the message had w
not been referred to the committee of ways
and means, to make an estimate of the ex- 2 (
penee which would /probably be incurred. 111
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania had
said it was firft necessary to pass a law to
authorize the exper.ee ; but if he coiid al
prove that the expence was already autho- in
rized, that gentleman must allow that the of
mefiage ought now to go to the committee 1,11
of ways and means. Was it a fad, Mr. aK
S. asked, that a law was necessary to autho-
liuean expence which the Executive saw
necessary to incur ? He said not. The con- a ' n
ftitution had authorized it ; for the-conftj
tution had given to the President the power fe<
of holding treaties. For the Executive, an
therefore, to appoint commissioners for the
holding of a treaty, was a fuffieient autho
rity for the expence, without any law.
was there a single treaty which had been a
held between this country and foreign nati- tlii
onsâ or between this country and Indian a '"
tribes, which had been previously authori- P r
zed by law ? There was not ; tlie conftitu- na
tion had placed this authority in the Exe- ,j.
cutivewithout theconcurrenceof that house. ;i lt
To suppose the contrary, would be to sup- tfu
c't pose that thi Pri.Cdcnt bad been nfiing
al- without law i;i appointing com-nifTigncrs to
no hold a treaty. Tift truili was, however,
per that he had as much power to do'\vliat he
had done, as he had power to Jo any thing
f>r and that the house had nothing to do but
U. appropriate the money,
he Mr. Rutl edge did not believe it was ne
ed ceffary or proper, for that house to atithorife
en the President to hold a treaty ; but if it were
ey necefiary for him to hold a treaty, th* con
currence of that house was necefiary to ena
rfe ble him to do it, as it could r.ot be done
.a- without money. It was rcquifite therefore,
to pass a bill, not to authorize the President
'as j to hold n treaty, but to enable him to do it.
i- llt was best, therefore, for the communica
lat tion firit to go into a committee of
by and afterwards to the committee of ways
u- and means, in order them to fay where thtf
re- money oould be got. There was fo'msthing
ut in this cafe, which pointed outjthis mede
be as peculiarly proper, as there seemed to be
ce a difpofitioii iu the house, if the treaty fliould
)t. not succeed agieeably to the wifhesof the
he President, to afford temporary relief to the
ty persons now iuffering from being driven
ut from their land The gentleman from Con ;
id neflicut had said, that the committee of
is, ways and means could report an estimate of
e; the probable expence wjych would be in
nd curred in holding the treaty; but if he at
;â¢ tended to the message of the President, he
an would find that this ellimate was to be laid
e- before the house by the proper department,
he so that there was no necefiity for a reference
ly to any committee for that purpose.
The motion for a referenceto the commit
be tee of the whole was carried without a di
x- vision.

Extraft of a letter from in Mas- j
fachufetts, dated Januwy 9, 1798.
:a- " My letters from England announce the
,j e expectation there, thit the arms of the
y S French Republic are next to Jje
jus in reducing Spain to the form of Provinceâ
,g m expunging Portugal from the catalogue
(] e of nationsâand in subverting and plunder
|,e ing Hamburg and Denmark. Like the
y Romans whom they imitate, war and ra
pine are necefiary to their exiilence ; and if
, e the modern Carthage does not reft rain them,
â  n and they remain united, doubtless they will
n . revolutionize the whole civilized world, and
0 f we mud again fight for independence, or
0 f lofie it. If, however, England is not des
nA troyed by internal faftion, flie will be able
t . to keep the monllers in their den, until they
le devour each other."
t The author of the paragraph in yesterdays
Gazette relative to the Frigates, in which
Mr. Francis's accounts are mentioned, did
t _ not mean to insinuate, that there was any
delay in bringing forward those accounts.
It may be proper also to state, that only'
c _ jone of the Frigates is under the fuperinten
,t dance of Mr. Fiancis.
The Eastern mail had not arrived when this
