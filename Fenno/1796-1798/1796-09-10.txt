A very valuable Meh chant Mill, if
A DISTILLERY apd BREWERY, and sundry STONE
qUARRIES to be let
I will rent my met chant Mill at the little Fails of Po
towmac, for any term not less than leven, nor mora than
eleven from the firft day of Septetrtber nest. The
mill-houf is 42 by 40 feet, three (lories high, built with
ft, (lone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two
ir- over (hot 18 feet water wheels, and Evans's machinery
complete, with every other thing proper and necessary for
~ carrying on the business with dispatch, and at as little ex
pense as pofliblc, all io good order.âFrom the mill to my '
landing on the Fotomac river, (wherecraft, of any bur
then may deliver grain and take in flour) it is about 40 ol
yards, and from thence by water to George-Town and ai
arf, the City of Washington, about 3 mi|es, and to Alexan- p<
, n g dria about r 1 miles, This situation, aided by a fufficient al
capital, will command the produce of a very extenfivt k
back country, where large quantities of wheat and other 0
grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8 ''
to 10 milts less than to any naatket town upun the navi- *
â ga'tion of the Potow ac. There on the premises a
large (lone Coopers' (hap, a (lone granary, and a commo
dious milltr's bouse. At the landing aforcfaid a bridge
I is now building nver the Potomac, which is in great for
rSc wardnefs and probably will be finifhed the enfuing,fall.
5 C3 ' There are also on the premises,' a Brewery and Distille
ry, built with Hone, in them are three stills, two coppers
or boilers, with every necessary article, all new, and in
good order, and fufliciently large to carry on the Brew
ery and Diflillery upon a very extensive plan. This prop
erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my laads adjoining the premises, and along the
bank; of the river, where craft may load with cafe and dis
patch, is an i nmcnfc q lantity of building and founda
tion Hones. Four quarries are now open, and as many
mote may be opened with cafe: the stone taken from these
quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it- I will rent these quarries
separately or together as may btft suit.
On the top oi the hill, and about 200 yards from the
mill, is a stone Dwelling-house, large enough for the ac- ,
comoiodation of a family : also, a kitchen, dairy, smoke- ,
house, &c and a garden, enC ofed and in cultivation, the <
foi of which is equal in goodness to any in this Hate. I j,
will also rent this property. (
Adjoining to the Brewery and Diflillery is a Smith's 1
etr.s (hop, in which is a complete set of BlaikfiAith's tools, I
by which 1 will also rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
will tenant two negro blacksmiths, one sf them is a complete
workman.
day I: I rent out the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts,
which were built for the purpose of carrying stone : they
r. will altogether bring ilpwards- of 90 perch Immediate
poffefiion will be given; For terms apply to the fublcrib-
or in this town.
The Mill, Brewery and DiftiiMy, withtheir appurten
ances, will be delivered to the tenant or tenants in good
repair', and muftbe so returned, at the expiration of the
lease orleafes, ,

SUMMARY.
THE advantages to the allies were never more
equivocal, than at the present time. The French
emoy the pride of vi&ory, and enrich themselves
on the Seas, upon which they have been defeated.
The Dutch, against whom every thing ha* been
prÂ«diÂ£ted, from Prussia at one time, and -at another
from the Statholder, from the loft of commerce,
from French tyranny, from the Scheld, and their in
terna! commotions, find ia their temperance, fruga
lity and '.ndvjftry, their former ample rcfourcet, and
the interference of their ally is only a* they require.
The appearance of Ruffian fleet in the Atlantic
announced, bat we have not yet been told to
afTociate (irror with the event. That they aw to
receive supplies from theji northern regions, ia all'
that has for some time been reported refpe&ing
them. They have not evea a part in the Solitary
captures, which are reported atgreater length, than,
the most important victories of Italy. From the
North we hear often that Rui&a threatens Sweden,
whom (he cannot fear, and yet dares not to despise.
â¢' And these angry negooiationi, which we know not
bow far they partake of private prejudices, are the
only works of fame, which have been atchieved,
since tWfc conquefl of Poland, by this great nation.
The Emperor does not appear to be supported by
the hearty concurrence of the Empire. From Ita
ly the French have entered upon his dominions,
while his General complaint that he can make no
refinance, or assert the independence belonging to
the name df the Roman Empire. His General on
the Rhine is publicly preaching against defection,
â while the Emperor is thought to be negociattng for
leave to negociate with his formidable enemies.
The Spaniards find spirits, they never felt before.
While the terrors of a French invasion were near,
and their forces which cowld l>e opposed were un
worthy of confidence, they had only deftru&ion in
their view. They had openly detelted the -princi
ples and the chaia&er of the French revolution.
They had inspired a general terror at their irsftilts

maintained a policy, which might dilative at the
name of liberty. ' They negociated, an<J they found
all their prejudices furmouuted. In no alliance
have they ever appeared more sincere. The French,
whom they reproached, they r.ow confefs have some
virtues, and some honoui. They have experienced
a genera* joy without convullions of the State.
And by the concurrence of the ecclesiastical pow
er of Rome,"have aceomplilhed wi'hout violence a
reformation of the religious orders. Their army
marches at their own will. Their 4eet is under
their own command, and thty are the meflengers
and miniilert of peaoe to their neighbours. Thra
new situation forces itfelf upon the public notice,
and is-a to >oiany infinuationt against the
French nation. The French incursions into Italy
may have some of the evil* of the Crusades, and
yet not be without greater advantages. Europe
has been more happy., since those bold a<fis of en.
thuiufm, and the bold claims of faperflition in the
Chrillian world may soon be no more. The Danes .
have conftimmated their prudence, and have paid
the tribute, to which greater nations submit, of Co
liciting-and purchasing apeace with Algiers. Even
in this age of light and truth, rhe policy of Europe
has fuffered a nation tocxift, vriiofe support is war
with commerce, Law is depredation, and
â whose tribute is for the freedom of the Sea. A
Grotius and a Selden exhauded history to eftablifa,
or difputt the dominion of the Seas. But the pri
vilege deniedÂ«by enlightened nations to each other
Â» surrendered voluntarily to the Barbarians of
Africa. This is not policy with morality. Eng.
land rides fecuieupon the Storm. Triumphant on
the Seas, and fafe from invasion, (he commands the
wars, which desolate nations. Proud of her mo
. narchy, and powerful in her laws, she defies her ene
mies. Her Allies fear to insult' her will, and
chufe to obey. Rich even by her debts, <he holds
the greatest icfources, and fiaurifhet in ware, which
make the world tremble.
AT HOME. We things are in peace.
1 ht tale from Wilmington refpefting the emigrants
who have fought our peaceful Hiorcs, demands , the
vigilance of the magillrate to punish the cruel ava
nee which has facrificed the innocent to its rapaci
ty. We are hippy to hear that this fubjeft has
gained the public attention. We learn, that Gen.
<â C. Pincknev is to succeed Mr. Monro as our
Ambassador to France, and that this gentleman
will do benour to his country. Jotl Barlow, the
hero of liberty, iÂ» to be the American Consul at
rtlgiers. By the lad accounts, tlie mortality con
tinued in St. Domingo, but more in Port-au-Prince
than at the Mole. The French were in motion
against Jeremie, and the Enghlh were ceHefting a
force at the Mole. The French have little to dp,
while the ravages of disease are so cruel. Jamaica!
aus perhaps no part of the Welt-Indies is friendly
to the conllilution of the Americans, who visit at
this feafort.' Many deaths are reported to us. In
the States, the mortality has not been so alarming
as in some years pall. Reports from Charleston are
not so diltreffing, and we trust th t appearances ate
less thteateiung in (he different parts of out own
state. 111 oiii political affairs there is general quiet.
Some que It uns will remain to agitate the public
inind, and demand the national vigilance, and in
tlie rcfpedlive States there ar ( e fame temporary jea.
loulies. In the Tcneffe-, the Governor has con
â voiced tlie Affcrably <Â»Â» the fubjed of a difference
in the laws of the Union, from those which ex ill in
that Territory, in order to amend or petition. And
the late jffeffments of Rhode-island have produced
or been accompanied with competitions between
New port and Providsnce. But these are not we
trnft lei ious affairs. In Bollan, their rival Theates
have .drawn the public attention to the expenceÂ»
they create, and to the advantages which arc deriv.
Ed from them. It is agreed, thai the moral advan
tage? ought to he veiy great, to indemnify far the
pure bate. We hear fiom Philadelphia that a por
trait of Ri;te<iin;ufe may be yrefcrvtd for poflerity,
and that the public have thc oftcr from an ingenious
hand. rattiotilin is invaluable to all nations; and
one GiCIUwU us iflfpiring it is, gratitude to national
i r
benefa&orsâ- to the friends of science and of" gov-,
ernmentâto great men, and to inventive genius.
What patriot would not prefer impressions of the
heroes of hit country, from wooden blocks, to a
dorn his apartments, to the richest papers of China,
re the bed hangings, or the dearest ornamenta ? We
:h hope fitch worka will be encouraged, and that every
es apartment will-teach our children the history of
J. their couutry, frstn the most simple ornaments
:n which can adorn it. Let not France be more fond
tr of her rich colle&iepa, or England (hew the monu

i. America retains the love of all who have aided her
i infancy, and nursed her conftitutipn. Let every
id metal, and the variously moulded clay, speak her

ic countenances of her bed men. The good preacher

ill' proclaim liberty i the artist inflame genius; and the
g immortal writer call to the petufal of his facied
7 pages, or the recolledlion of his wisdom, wherever

le COMMERCE OF LONDON.
1, The following (ketch of the Commerce of the Port
v. of London, is said to he taken from the mod au
y thentic document!, and supported by incontrovert.
i- able evidence:
s, Of the good* imported into London, the ex por
o tation, in the time of peace, bore a proportion of
0 four to twelve to the importation ; that is, one 3d
n part of the import was consumed by other nations}
i, the goods sent to various pans of England coad
>t wife not being included in this proportion of four,
s. Since the commencement of the war, and parti
e. cularly during the two lad years, both imports and
r, exports have confiderahjy increased: and the pro
-1 portion of tbt exports to the imports, has been
n much greater., The import* during each ot these
i- years, amonnted to about fourteen or fifteen milli
1. ons; in 1794, the export! of foreign goods amsunt
ts ed to seven trillions, and in (795, to upwards of
d eight millione.
te The value of the exports from the port of Lott
d don, upon average of three .years preceding the
:e war, amonnted to four millions. Their average
1, value since rhe war, is a third greater.
te In the above Ratement of value, the calculation
d has been regulated by the-ancient entries in the In
i. fpe&or-Genaral's book ; that is, merchandise has
i- been set down at the price it bote a century ago.
a To obtain the true value, eveiy one of the preced
y ing ftims must be doubled ; and it should be also ob
tt served, that the duty it not included in the edi
rs mate. *
ts The exportt in 1794., including British manufac*
Â», tures, amounted to above sixteen millions of these,
e therefore, nine millions were British manufadlures.
y The true value of foreign -exports was fourteen mil.
d lions t and that of the Britilh manufactures, proSa
e bly, in the fame proportion to their nominal price.
1. The effed of the deftruftion of Holland, in in
e creasing our foreign exports, is obvious, by, throw
is . nig into our hands the carrying trade, which it
d was once the greated -care of the Dutch to pre
1. serve; and the effed of the tuinous date of France
n is equally obvious, in the greater quantity of Bri

the exultttio* which has marked the rife of one peo
