'7*ranjlated for the Gazette of tb- United
From 3. Parii gaper entitled L.e Republican J /(in
fait, dated April 10, 1796.
To the Editor of the Republican Frangais.
THE Treaty of Â£ommerce lately concluded
between the American and the English govern
ment, is the specious pretext on which the enemies
of France found their insinuations that the execu
tive of the United States is not well disposed to
wards the Fiench Republic, and that he is entirely
in the iaterefts of England. A true exposure ot
facts will demonstrate the falfeÃood of these insinu
ations, and juflify the conduÂ£l of the government
of my country.
When the French Republic declared war againfl
England, orders were given by tie committee of
public fafety, to seize, without difoiimination, all
American veflels which French (hips ps war should
find on the sea, and fend them into the different
ports of the Republic. These orders have been
flri&ly executed, and even with a good deal of
1 rigour : numbers of American captains have been
taken from on board their veflels, a.id carried fey
the captors to ports rfmote from those to which
they sent their pretended prizes; the crews dis
persed, some of them impiifoned, Itnd otherwise
ill treated ; the agents of the government seized
many of the cargoes, put them in a state of re
quisition, even of those velTels deltined for the ports
of France, and many of these cirgoes are not yet
paid for, notwithstanding the numerous representa
tions to our ministers againfl all these violations of
our treaties of Alliance and Commerce, violations
which would be regarded by ail oiher powers, less
moderate, and less fineercly attached to ths French
Republic than the United States, as so many- .acts
of hofliiity.
The Convention passed a Jeace, purporting
that France would cease arresting our veflels at sea,
when the powers at war with the Republic should
refpeft our -flag.
We had no treaties of Alliance and of Com
merce with England, and we never should have
formed any if France had not forced us to it by
this folimn declaration.' In short, vliat else could
the government of rhe United States do, to pro
te& the maritime commerce of iti citizens, in
-circumstances so diffieult ? The Erglifh pillaged
our veflels on one fide, and the Frerch ruined cur
commerce on the other.
Our commerce thus a prey to two of the belli
gerent powers, France reduced us, by the declara
tion above reeited, to the alternativ of breaking
with England, or of making a treaty with her.â
This last measure, since the peace of 1783, had
always been avoided by oar government; bgt it
was preferable to a rupture which would have been
prejudicial to our commercial intereils: we should
have been deprived of the means of provifloning
the French islands, and of furnifhing the French
Republic with those innumerable cargoes of grain
and which have entered their ports. The
committee of public fafety were ve.y sensible that
our neutrality was more advantageaus to France
than a state of war, without a marine equally re
fpe&able to oppose to the fleets of Great-Britain,
and it was this consideration that led them te ap
prove of ouf neutrality ; but the depredation
committed upon our commerce rendered a treaty
witlr England inÃifpenfable, in order to put an end
to it.
' Nothing was more .difficult to acsomplifh ; the
English minister saw with jealousy the marked pre
ference of the United States in favor of Franceâ
the part which they took in America, in the fuir
ceffes of the Republicâthe public rejoicings in
which they celebrated the news of every victory
of the Frenchâand the public wishes of all my
fellow-citizens for the prosperity and triumph of
the Republic, pubh'fhed in all the journals and ga
zettes of the United States; in fa<ft, the Britilh
minister was so much irritated againfl us, that in
the end of the year 1793 ' c was decided in the
council of St. James to declare war againfl us :â
but the retaking of Toulon by the victorious arms
of the Republic, and the subsequent conquests of
France, diverted the florm which was ready to
break upon us.
In this hostile disposition towards us on the pait
of G. Britain, it was'impoflible for our govern
ment to conclude a treaty with her, for the pro
tadlion of out commerce, without giving her some
great advantagesâbut the clause of the treaty
which formally declares that no article shall be
construed derogatory to our treaties with France,
ought fully to fatisfy the government of the Re
public in t}iis refpedl.
I do not pretend to defend the treaty of Mr.
Jay againfl the attacks of several of my compa
triots, but only to demonstrate that France has no
cause of complaint, and that the government of
my country has done nothing to juftify the accusa
tions of those who endeavor to perfuade'the people
that the President of the United States entertains
fentimer.is unfavorable to the Republic. They
ought to be considered as the enemies <jf France,
as well as of America, who seek t6 disunite the
two nations. It should be reoolle&ed, that the
United States are the firfl power who, at an im
mense diftanee, recognized the Fiench Republic ;
and that it was the firfl who appointed a minister
j lenipotentiary to iefide in France in that capacity..
I know that it will afford a tnuipph to the enemies
of France should they succeed hÂ» their endeavors
to embroil us. The difaffefted will leave no me
thods uneffnyed to flir up jealousy and discord be
tween the two Republics, and for this purpose
they will repeat at Paris the fame intrigues, which
they would have playeS at Philadelphia but the
government of France is too wife to give intofuch
palpable attempts to them,,aid they will
not be more fuccefsful here than they have been
with the executive of America.

LONDON, May 12.
" â¢ SIERRA LEONE COMPANY.
The Dire&ors have lately published their Re
port, delivered at the last Meeting by the Chairman,
Mr. H. Fliornton, which contains a brief account
of the pre lent ttalc of'tnc Colony, grounded upon
the declaration they had proposed on a former oc
casion, of reducing wjthin narrow limits the whole
amount of the risk which they wire about to in
cur io Afiica. The fettlcment has, since the at
tack there reported, continued uninterruptedly to
improve, and has not become fobjedfc to any new
danger or calamity. The healthiness of the cli
mate has also improved. The deaths of iVjhty of
the one hundred and twenty. BritiCh sailors then
said to have been landed (here by the French from
captured /hips, and of several others since, are found
to have been caused by the hardfhipa they had fuf
fered, and the Want of medicines and accommodati
on, which had been destroyed in the unprincipled
ravages committed ; and those other cases which
have happened, have not excliifivcly aiifen from
climate ; for it is remarkable that, during the rainy
season, the Company loft none of their servants.
The Nova-Scotia blacks have been remarkably
healthy, and their births have far exceeded their
deaths. This account is up Co the 31ft of Octo
ber, 1795.
The lirft ship, carrying any material quantity of
trade gaods, which failed since the Colony was
plundered by the French, had not arrived at the
date of the lad dispatches. A fa&or) has been
raised at a small expence on the river Rio Pongas,
twelve leagues from the river's mouth, which af
fords an easy introduction to ths capital of the
Foolahs and is under protedlion of that King.
Some delay and, difficulty occurred in forming the
factory, by the opposition and mifreprefentatious of
the neighbouring European traders, and Dy th# uni
ted efforts of the (lave traders ofall the nearer and
some of the more distant parts, to induce the na
tives to remove it; but a palaver was held, in which
the Chiefs gave credit to the good designs of the
Company. From the call for various articles of
eommerce, those already shipped are expe&ed to
come to a good market; and a second (hip has been
freighted accordingly.
The Company's preferrt property is dated to con
fid of a capital in securities of 60,0001. in trade
26,0001. and of Stock 011 the Colony oÂ£ 9,0c01.
making a total of 95,000!.
Many of the Nova Scotians, since the French
attack, have been diiven from the coast through
fear, and have established more distant farm lots,
which had been before neglefled. These lon on
the mountains are the belt, the others generally
good ; and the cultivation of fifty new farms has
been begun. Premiums of forty dollars have been
given as encouragements to fettle within a mile
from Freetown. The Company's cultivations on
the Bulam (hore have not advancejL_for_wÂ«u..oÂ£-
goods, Jcc. Coffee and cinnamon plants, ginger,
and several other articles, have been obtained by a
vessel freighttned from the Colony to the island of
St. Thomas in April 1795. Tropical feeds and
plants from the Weft-Indies have been loft by the
captureof Weft-India vessels ; and the vessel Prant
Hatch, containing many valuable articles from the
King's garden at Kew, was entirely destroyed by
the French.
The conduct of the Nova-Scotians has been very
refpe&ful ; they haÂ»e voluntarily offered to erect
some works for the future defence of the cclony ;
they have elected tithing men and hundredors; their
young persons have been put apprentices to English
artificers ; they have built boats, and began to car
ry on a trade by barter' with the neighbouring
head men or chiefs: their children are at school in
the colony.
A delegate from some free blacks in Rhode Isl
and arrived at Sieria Leone last year, and terms for
receiving twelve families, certified to be of good
morals, have been fettled to encourage their emi
gration ; each family is to have ten acres of land
on the Bulam fide of the river for a farm lot, and
an eighth of an acre for a town lot also, for which
they are to pay a quit rent, and conform to
laws of the Colony.
Two baptist missionaries have failed from Eng
land in one of the Company's Yhips, wishing to fet
tle under some African Chief ; and other persons
properly qualified have also failed for religious in
ftru&ors j a few Englilh families have also failed
for the purpose of going directly to the capital of
the Foolah kingdom, 300 miles itiland, and to fet
tle there ; their exper.ces ar<t borne by a voluntary
fubfeription in England, and â  they allowed a free
pafiage to Sterra Leone. .
The disadvantages under which the Colony has
laboured have been greaj, arid the expences consi
derable ; nevertkele's; every year's experience fecms
to have added to the of its establishment
and future prosperity, and to have afforded freth
proof of the pratticability of cultivating and civi
lizing the Continent of Alyca !

SALFORD, May 10.
A person, lately a resident of Salford, a few
evenings ago, having faqrificed a little too freely to
the jolly God, in a viiit to a few of his old neigh
bours, took his departure for home at a very late
(or rather early) heur in the morning : having a
bout three miles to walk, and very often losing the
balance of power' ere he had attained half the way,
at last he fell near the moutii of a coal-pit, about
half a mile from his house ; here the leaden hand
of Morpheus lay so heavily upon him, that he soon
forgot h.s danger and himfelf in a found sleep. Not
long had he lain there before the black gentlemen
. of the pit arrived, to resume their daily task ; these
wicked wags (four or five in number) fodn agreed
to fallen the sleeping vifitar.r into thÂ«ir bafltet, and
introduce hiai into tlieir internal regions jthis was
done with all poffiblc fafctv ; an'd he ,va.s fe n j f
in the subterraneous regions. A figure of Â« blsc
ugly boy whs placed by his lide to watch him dos
ly when he (hould awake, wl.'icli, when he did an
opened his eyes upon the ohjeft, proceed an e'flv<
upon his mind, body and face, that emphatically d,
elared (for he vvas fpsechlefs with h orror i j,
thought himfelf really among the dlmn'd, aâÂ§ t h; ;
this lad was no more nor left than one of ti
D 's Imps. As soon as he was fjirly awakt
the sweat running from his brow with horror ti
lad exelaimed, "On ! wh.t you're corns a; la'ft at'c
you! Aye, aye, I'il fetch my Meatier, the eaw :
one, to you." Accordingly the lad ran, and foo;'
brought, not one, but four 01 five old ones, who
bilrft forth with horrid diffinant voices " Oli
what he's her?, is he ? aye, we're been expecting
him this Jong time part ! Come, come, confefsyoir
finsdiieaiy, or elfc you go !Â« o a bed of btimlton
in a momefit:" Here they prtrcloeetf a black booi
in which they pretended to regifier what h â¢
(hould confefs. As soon as he could speak, h
begg'dfor God's fake'that they would have mercy
011 him, and he would tell all his offences, thong,
he solemnly declared, they were very few. HÂ« '
then said, that he had got drunk with fomefriend:
in Salford, and fell afkepoH his way home, whe
he supposed that a cart had gone over him and kill'
him. " Aye, aye, that wÂ« know very well,"â
roar'd the demons, â" But your fins ! yourlks !'
" Why, cries the trembling b-ulprit,â" 'Trs true
me and one Thomas did once (leal a pig,"
" a pig did you ? come, as it was only one ol
the fwinifli Aultitude, we'll forgive him for that.'
â" But what else ?" " Why, once i did rob ul<
Mary ââ â's garden of some of her codlings.''
" Well but," fays Bclzebub the chief, " What fe
male connections have you had ? Have you neve
ruined any wenches !" " No ; God knows I neve
have ; 'tis true, I once had connection with a younj
woman, but who turned out nought, ,or I wouh
have married her. " Who was (he ?" cried tin
leading fiend : â¢' Her name was Peggy â¢'
Here three of the black gentlemen buifl out into i
roar of laughter ; but the leading Â»ne, who pu
the queltion,~ was chop-failen, as fcloueft Peggj
turned out to l?e no other than-his own dearly be
loved wife ! ! ! it is unnecessary to add, that thÂ«
culprit was again basketed, and restored to the
light of Heaven, to the mutual fatisfadtion of hot!
the Devil and the Damned.
LONDON, May 28.
Philip Parry Price Middleton was tried on
Thursday in the Court of King s Bench, for en.
deavoring to entice artificers to emigrate to Ame
rica.' It appeared he was a of property, and
had engaged 1500 persons for that purpose. He
was found guilty. The penalty is 500!. and one
year's imprisonment.
A most (hocking scene was witnessed yeflerday
in Dean-street, Eaft-Smithfield. The inhabitant!
of an houfeof ill fame in that (treet, having made
an lialty decampmdnt eaily in morning, fome
of the neighbors, whose suspicions weifc excited by
this sudden movement, went into the house ; and,
on going up stairs, 1 one of the rooms,
the body of a weii drclTed young man, suspended
by the neck from the bed poll, with his hands pini
oned slofe to his fit e, by alt out cord. TV â  i"Â¥~
"petratois ot mis norna att wefeTnTlai.ily traced and
apprehended. The unfortunate young man was a
(hip mailer ; and is reported to have had about him
a considerable sum of money.
Last Wednrfday as some men were attempting
to recover a but!, : which had fallen into a draw
well upwards of an hundred feet deep, belonging
to the New Inn (tables, in North-flicet, Brighton,
they drew up, by means of their g*a; p!e-hooj;s,
which had fixed in one of the thighs, the body of
a young woman, well known at Biighton, where
â (he had for some time pall fubfiCkiT on t:.e~f<ecariout
and sorry wages us pro(litutL6n. It is not howe
ver even fufpe6ted that she put a period to her own
existence, but believed that (he vvas dabbed wjdi Â»
bayonet and thrown into the well; for in her Tide
there appeared a wound evidently given with fnch
atl indiument, and on her head there was a large
contusion. The Coroner's jury fat on her bod)
and delivered i;i their veididt Wilful Murder againlt
persons unknown.
In one of the causes tried lately before Lord
Kenyon, at Guildhall, wherein Counlel contended
that, two witnefle.s were not entitled to crcdit, on
account of-kerpmg itrfamouig"3mÂ£7Tt Ij> houses, his
Lordship said, " I am sorry I did not know i'oon
er that ftich witnesses were to be brought forward,
for I have in my pofTefiion a-lift, containing a great
number of persons of that description, sent to me
l>w the unfortunate Mr. Weftan ; and, I am sorry
to fay, that amocg the number is the came ot a
pet foil of very high rank."
In the career of copqueft, the French have nat
attempted to revolutionize Italy ; and we find that
our minillers persevere in their scheme of exciting
civil war in the interior of France. What (hall
we fay of this conduct ? Is Jacobinism transferred
from the Rue St. Honoreto Downing-ftreet ?,Cer
tainly the proclamation whicn the gentleman who
calls himfelf the Prince .de Bouillon has put forth,
inviting ( Frencji officers to fly to the Itandard of
royalifm in Brittany, is calculated to piovoke the
fury of fraternization. Civil war is the Jacobinism
of Royalty, as Revolution is of Repubhcanifm ;
and by an attempt so impolitic as well asfcandaloul,
it cannot be denied that we juftify the French in
turning all the force of their indignation against
England.

Descartes is or.e of those creative geniuses thai

to (lifcover its mictianifin, and explain its formation

principles and effe&sof matter and motion ; heap
plied them to the heavens and to the earth, toman
and to animals ; be lirft had thole philosophical
ideas to which Bacon could not aspire for want of
a knowledge of geometry.
Descartes is also inventor in mathematics, by the
application of algebra to geometry ; he opened a
new career, which Newton entered ; but Newton
had rivals in of the calculation of in
finities and the law of attrition ; and DeL-artcs
had none in his.
These two data would be susceptible of a
lengthy developement ; but those who are acquaint

, ception was highly .flatteringfrom all of people.
At half pall three her Royal Hlghnefs returned
I to Carlton Hqufis to dinner. The Princess was at
the Opera on the preceding evening, where her
â¢ entrance and exit were narked with the warmed
t gratulations by a very larg* and polite audience.
The Princess of Wales is doubtless by thistifne
i convinced, that she, who is one day dellined to
1 grace the throne of Britain, can never, while ihe
perseveres in a line of condudl so truly exemplary,
r want friends and prote&ors, who will (helter her
from insult, and resent die injuries she may receive
from whatever quarter they may proceed.
The interett which the public takes in the dis
putes unfortunately existing in a ce'rtain Great Fa
mily, exceeds all credibility. It is the topic--of
conversation iif every company, and evety one pitiej
and execrates the different parties.
An elderly Lady, whose influence over the
Gentleman both before and since his marriage has
been matrer of astonishment, is said to have broken
open a letter written by the youn* bride to her
father, and committed to the care of a gentjeman,
who afterwards finding himfelf unable to go abroad,
returned it to the v house, where it fell into the
hands of the elderly Lady, and was opened. This
letter contained complaints against the hnfband's
ill tieatmenf, produced by the intrigues of the
elderly Lady-; and a knowledge of its contents, it
ieems, oecafioned an aggravated degree of ill usage
towards the Bride, till at lad (he consulted a cer
tain great Law Lord, refpedling her departure
from this kingdom, one of whom, now in no of
ficial Situation, offered his mediation, which was
rejected by the Husband, and his Lordship forbid
den the house. The husband, it is said, has not
spoken to his wife these three months.
Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Dutchefs
of York are unremitting in their attention to the
Princefs.of Wales.
The polite and affectionate afiiduity of Prince
William of Gloucester to the fame lovely Princess,
bespeaks a reCUiude of judgment, as well as a ten
derness of nature.
On Monday evening as a Lady in her carriage
was going to Drury lane Theatre, (from the fimi
larity of her livery with that of a certain countess,)
(he was hided, and her servants covered with dirt,
before they could convince the mob of their mis
take.
It would cej-tainly be a very ineffaftual method ol
performing ajourney, to put one horse before, and
another behind a carnage ; but -h would be much
more than insffeClnal, to give the rein to a r'eftive
intraclicable horned bead, who, if you wanted to go
to St. James's, would probably go to Giles's.
However the King, may be wrongly accused of
promoting for eign IVar,yet he exerts every endea
vour for the edablifhment of damejlic Peace.
1 he Princess of Wales, who is a good claflic, on
feeing the Duchess of York, exelaimed with a ten
der sigh,
" Felix Andromache certo benenupta marrto."
Whilit the infamous Duke of Orleans was riot
ing in the lowed sensual pi'eafures, he was always
observed to (hew the greased refoeCt for his truly
refpetlabie Consort ; as if he endeavoured by this
external homage, to indemnify her in some measure
for the disgrace of being united with a man fd'uni
â vcrfally delpifed. Sjjch an ascendant does virtue
possess even over the mod depraved minds!
Lord Frederick Townfhend is a clergyman, and
has been two or threi times confined
toms of lunacy, one under DoCtor Willis. The
Marquis, his father, and other friends, were sent
for; but as in such cafe no bail could be taken by
the magistrates, he is committed to fafe cultody to
abide the of the laws of his country.'

Captain Uutneriord, from KenneUeck, bound to Alex

Capt. A. was boarded on Friday evening la ft, at J
o'clock, eight leagues E. S. E. from Cape Henry by
the Britjft frigate Prevoyante, Capt. Wemyfs, who,
and his officers, behaved very insolently to him, in
breaking open'hishatches, prtffing his hands, &c. (See
Captain Alden'sproteft in thij day's paper.) The fri
gate Thetis, Capt. Cochran, was in company with the
Prevoyante.
Captain Cochran told Captain J!den, that he had
not seen the French frigate Concord (which was ye-
Jierday reported to have been taken by the Thetis,) but
that Jke had escaped him and got out to sea. This be
ing on Friday the $th injl. it is hardly possible the much
talked of engagement fhpuld have taken place, and the
news of the ij/ue reached- New- York, by Monday the
&th, which is the date of the letter that announces it,
especially as the wind has been in an unfavorable quar
ter ever fmce. .
Tpe iatefl papers brought hy the Thomas, are to the
I%th May, which is not Jo late by 18 day* as those re
ceived by the late arrivals at NcuWork and Boflon ;
any thing, however, that may appear worth insertion,
shall be given to-morrow.

Alden, from Liverpool.
I, David Alden, mailer of the (hip Thomas, beloreia*
toJPorthnd, in the fiate of Maflachufetts, failed frcm Li
verpool on the ad day of June last, bound for Baltimore,
in the (late of Maryland. Nothing material happened
'till the 10th of July, when, in lat 42, 13, long. 61, 26
being under clofe-recfed top-fails, the wind began to blow
in heavy squalls from the westwardâabout 1 P.M took in
top-fails and coursesâat 1 P.M set the courses and clofe
reefed top-failsâat 8 P.M. a heavy fqaall took us sudden
ly, which laid the ship down very much and fjplit the three
top-faiis The wind continuing to blow very heavy 'till
i P. M. obliged us to lie by under mizen stay-sail, fmce
which the fliip has proved leaky. On the *oth, the wind
blew heavy from S. W. to W. S. W. which at Â« P. M, oÂ«.
bliged us to take in mainsail and fore topsail at 5 P.' M.
took i.i ail but mizen and mizen flayfail and lay by it
blowing very strong, attended with hunder, lightning
ami rain. Gn the 6th of August, Cape Henry "bearing W.
N. W. about 8. leagues diltance, was brought to by the:
Prevoyante, captain Wcmyfs, an Englilh man of war j
the captain sent his boat and took four of the (hip's crew,
5 paff.ngers and myfelf aboard the Prevoyante. Soon af
ter he sent his boat again and brought my mate with hU
cloaths, ordering a number of men on board the Thomas,
to search for more people, and after detaining us 'till 7
P. M. put my mate, two people, one paflenger and myfelf
on board the Thomas, aud kept two of my people and
teur passengers.
When v/*- came on board, we found the mam hatches
broke open, also the scuttles fore and aft, and one calk of
bottled Porter, of which a part was taken and much other
damage done.
From the bad weather and contrary winds which wew
have experienced, and having the hatchways and scut'
ties broke open and plundered, we have reason to judge
there is damage and lol's in the cargo.
