TO BE SOLD,
A LEASE forfmtn years, from the Isth March neat, In tltt
capital and beautiful FARM % called
PROSPEC T-H ILL,
Situated within one quarter of a mile from the Brindywine
Mills, and halt a mile from the borough of Wilmington.
THE dwelling house is built of (lone, two stories high,
genteelv fimfhed, and contains four handsome rooms on
â¢ floor, besides an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
Celiars. It is generally thought to command the most a
grceable profpeft of the Delaware, from the source of that
tivÂ« te the Capes. This profpeft ia greatly embellillied by
a full view of a vail body ot meadow, through which the
Chrifliana and Brandywine creeks ire fcen winding in beau
tiful meanders. Near ihe house are a Kitchen, a spacious
Hone liable and hay loft, a barn, a carriage houle, milk
hoafe, &c. and a well of as pure water as any on the conti
nent. The garden contains an acre and quarter of land, a
bounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, of
the very best kind, brought from Maryland, and in fall bear,
ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a young, spple
orchard begining to bear, and leveral old trees that produce
abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental trees, in
great numbers. The farm confifls of near fixcy acres of land,
of good quality, and clear of incumbrances, except taxes,
twenty of whish arenow in exoellcnt clover and timothy,
and ten more will be ready lor sowing next spring. . A re
sidence ot nearly 8 years has convinced the fublcriber that
the situation is remarkably healthy. The great post road
from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within feventv
yards of the house. In a word, the beauties aad conveni
ence of this situation cannot bo 1 numerated in au advcrtile
m?nt, and when examined, will probably command the at
tention of any person who is desirous of living at one of the
most elegant country feats on the contiaent. The purehafer
may enteton the premilts ne*t spring, or perhaps, this fall,
if application be immediately made to Doctor NICHOLAS
WAY, ia Philadelphia, to D>tlor WHARTON, on tlc
psemifes, or, in his absence, to Mr. GEORGE TRUITT, in
Wilmington.
A quantity of excellent Hay, Grain in Ihe ground, forae
Stock, &e. may be had by the purehafer Uthe time of lale.

WE thank you, ftr, for your faithful and de

We observe with pleasure, that the delivery of
the military polls, lately occupied by the Biitifh
forces, within the territory of the -United States,
was made with cordiality, and promptitude, as soon
Â»s circumdances would admit; and that "the other
provifionsof our treaties with Great-Britain and
Spain, that were objetts sf eventual ..arrangement,
ait sliotit being cairied iÃto effect, with entire har
tcicny and good faith.
The unfortunate, but unavoidable difficulties,
that opi/ofed a timefy compliance with the terms
of the Algerine treaty, are much to be lamented :
as they may oecafion a temporary suspension of the
advantages to be derived, from a solid pease with
that powef, and a pÂ«rfe& fecuiitv from its preda
tory warfare ; at the fame time, the lively impref
Â£ons that affe&rd the puttie mine?, on ttjj rcJtrap
tion of our captive fellow-citizens, afford the molt
laudable incentive to our exertions, to remove the
remaining obflacles.
WeperfefUy coincide with yuu in opinion that
the importance of our commerce demands a naval
force for its pro t eft ion again!! foreign infnlt and
depredation, and our folifitvide to attain that ob
ject will be always proportionate to its magnitude.
