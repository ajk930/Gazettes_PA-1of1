OBSERVING in Brown's paper of
pth, and Claypoole's of the 7th inft. a falfe|
and unfounded publication, refle&ing on the} cc
people of this city, refpedting two vefTels sla
arriving here, after laying two or three days |vÂ«
St the fortâthat the people rose in a mass, "co
cut them from the wharf, and obliged them tl
to drop below the town upon pain of being tn
fired at. The Pilgrim, captain Smith, then d
at the wharf, was requested to haul off for ti
two days, when she returned and discharged ft
her cargo : th? schooner Eutaw, Captain it
Brewfter, was ordered to lay off till her tl
quarantine was out, which she should have h
done at fort Mifflin. â¢ b
There was no rising of the people; and if a
the captain or owners are men of truth, they f
will not fay to the reverse. No doubt the
people here were uneasy, that the reudent v
physician there should permit vefTels from , c
the Wpft-Indies to come here to finifh their
quarantine.
A PHILADELPHIA)!#
AUTHENTIC.
Litter of the Mayor of Burlington to Governor
Mijfiin, and the Governor's answer.
Burlington, > Sept. \th, 1797- t
sir, ! <
THE anxiety of the inhabitants of this j
town has been for some days considerably ,
exfcited by a cireumftance which they can- 1 j
not but consider as contrary to the iuteri- ! ]
tio of the legislature of the state over which ,
you preside, and of the letter, as well as ,
spirit of your proclamation of the 15th of ]
August last, which evinces so prudent an at- ]
tention to the health of the citizens of Penn- ]
fylvania, that the corporation of Burlington,
on whose behalf I have the honor to address
you, rely on your assistance in preventing ,
the introduction of contagious disease into
the state of New-Jersey, by any evasion or \
mifconftruftion of the laws of Pennsylvania,
on which we have hitherto relied for pro
tection from the awful calamity.
Two vefTels, now lying at our wharves,
have arrived in this port, without comply
ing with the diredtions of your proclama
tionâThe brig Pilgrim, one of those vefTels
from Port au Prinee, (both the captain and
mate of which died, as we are informed, of
a contagious disease in the Weft-Indies,)
laidfive or fix days at the fort, when the reji
dent physician permitted her to depart, having
ten paifcngers aboard, on the mere afTurance
of the captain and owner that she would pro
ceed to this plnce. We apprehend the words
of your proclamation admit of no discretion with
refpeff to any vessel coming from the Wjl-Indies,
but absolutely requiring ten days quarantine.â
From the annexed *copy of a letter from
dodtor Mease to captain Smith, a discretion
appears to have been exercfed, and as we learn
from the captain on the mere afTurance of
the owner that she not go to Phila
delphia, although it evidently appears from
her papers and by the acknowledgement of
the master that she was bound for that pojrf.
The schooner Eutaw, captain Brewfter,fft>m
Cape Francois, the other of those veffcls,
performed but four days quarantine, and ar
rived here at the fame time with the Pil
grim, captain Smith. We do not learn
that the captain has any written permission
from the resident phyfic'un at the fort, to
proceed hither. Several of the late Phila
delphia papers contain the following para
graph : " The schooner Eutaw, Brewfter,
from Cape Francois, has gone up to Bur
lington to finifh her quarantine." Whether
this permiflion of the resident physician pro
ceeds from an exercise of discretion, or from
an opinion that the laws of Pennsylvania do
not admit of his detaining a vessel when a
verbal assertion is made by an owner or cap
tain, in opposition to her papers, that she
is bound to a pott in New-Jersey, as has been
hinted by the captains now here, we con
ceive it in no other light, than an evasion of
the law, which will, if tolerated, fruflrate
the intention of the legislature, and may
possibly be attended with fatal consequences
to us. We have been induced to lay this
matter be'fore you, fir, from a confidence
that it will receive from you that attention
which with pleasure we observe has been ex
tended towards the proper means of prevent
ing the introduction and increase of this
deftrudtive disease, and we are the ftiore so
licitous that early and decisive measures be
adopted, as we learn that several other ves
sels are daily expected here.
â¢ At the fame time that a faithful discharge
of our duty dictates the propriety of adopt
ing every prudent measure for the fafety of
our fellow citizens, be assured, fir, that we
are affeCted by the mofl lively sympathy at
the reflections excited by the misfortunes
of the citizens of Philadelphia, many of
whom are connected with us by the strongest
ties < f affedtion and friendfhip. To those
of them, amounting to several hundreds,
who have chosen this place as.an asylum,
we (hall feel pleasure to afford every accom
modation in our power, and we are persuad
ed that it is uimeceft.ry to urge their fafety,
as an additional inducement to the adoption
of the molt speedy precautions to prevent
a future evasion of your laws, and ensure
our own fafety.
With the highest respeCt,
I have the honour to be
Your excellency's mod obedient servant,
By order of the corporation,
JOSEPH BLOOMFIELD,
Mayor of the city of Burlington.
* Captain Smith,
I feud vou a letter fiom your owner, Mr.
Gerard : 'he desires you will proceed to
Burlington immediately, and he will go oa
- board at Kcnfmg.toi), if the tide carries yau
so far ; you may, therefore, get under way. JS
If you do not reach |the city, yon are not J
to land any of your paffer.gers on the Pennsyl
vania fide, at that'will fubjedt you to a fine.

Sir, 1 Â£
I have the honor to acknowledge the re-
ccipt of your letter dated yesterday, and to t ;
lament the occasion of the alarm, which it li,
. very justly expresses, in consequence of a ci
condufl on the part ofihe Resident Physician of 1
the Health Office of Philadelphia, that is, in ; j.
my opinion, highly irregular. I have j
directed an enquiry to be immediately infti- t;
tuted into the circumstances of the two cab
fes, to which your letter refers ; and you
may aflureour fellow-citizens of New-Jersey,
that any meafura which endangers their {j
health or distresses their feelings, can never h
be fanftioned by the laws of Pennsylvania, Â«
and will, as far as my power extends, be ef-
fedtually prohibited, ;l
Accept my best thanks for the sympathy '
with which you deplore the affliction of the
Â» citizens of Philadelphia, and believe me to
be, with great consideration and esteem, i

' " That no permission to haul to Bny

With a view of inspiring confidence-^ in

r- fellow citizens, that I loft during my lat|
1. attack of that fever, 176 ounces of blood by
n twenty two bleedings in ten days. The effi
,n cacy of this valuable remedy was aided by
o frequent and copious evacuations from my
n_ bowels, and a moderate salivation. Thro*
i- the blessing of heaven upon the above reÂ«ii
r, dies lam now, and have been, in a state of
r- rapid convalescence for several days, and
cr poflefs much tiiore strength than could be
0- expeÂ£ted by those who have not witnefled
m the effefts of such rejnedics.
[o I cannot conclude t"his short communica
a tion to my fellow citizens without expressing
p. my obligations to my kind friends Dr. Rush
ie and Dr. De Wees, for their affectionate and
:n vigilant attendance upon me: Also to Dr.
n- Coxe and Dr. Otto, for their occasional

The Spanish fleet is in the fame predica

Yesterday morning, at 10 o'elock, Mr.
| Brookes, a king's meflenger, arrived in town
with difpatchee from lord Malmefbury at
Lisle. He left that place on Tuesday af
| ternoon at four o'clock, reached Calais at
' four the next morning, and embarked in an
r open boat; but the tide being adverse, he re
: turned, and re-embarked in the Prince of
; Wales Packet, and arrived at Dover at orie
t ! Â©'clock; yesterday morning,
j As soon as circular letters could be feht
round to the mimfters, the cabinet met, and
? fat near two hours. There will be another
(. meeting this day.
s Late last night tve received the Pari*
. Gazettes down to the 23d inft. inclusive.
Strange to fay, they contain no one arti-
I cle, nor even surmise, refpe&ing the pro
gress of the negociation at Lisle; the most v
certain proof this, of the seCrecy with which
it is conduced. There are some very long
observations on the difficulties that arose in
- forming the new Administration, and that
Barthelerqy and Carnot publicly protested
, against several ofthenew nominations. There
~ was a division in the DiredWy on each no
e mination of 3to 2, excepting in the per
s foris of Truguet and Delacoix, for. who s e
ii difmiflal all the Dire&ors were of one opini
s on. It is understood that Rameland Mer
- liu will also be difmified; the former ii to be
succeeded by Montefquoiu. " If this change
really takes place, fays the Royalilt Jour
nal La Quotidienne, our fears ought to
i- cease refpedting the hostile disposition of the
h Diredlory." Hoche appears not of fuffici
i- ent age to accept the place of Minister of
d War. He is only 29 years of age, and the
it Constitution requires he (hould be 30. Pe
â - tiet, the former Minister, has been requested
:t to continue in his former situation, and the
1- Directory is much praised for this proof of
:r its conceflion to the public opinion. Previl
le Le Pellay is arrived at Paris' from Lisle,
iv and has entered on hia new office for the
n marine department. Talleyrand Perigord
g is rer nrted to have very pacific dispositions.
II âHaving loft his chara&er in the -early
)â  part of the French Rclolntion, he cannot so
y effeftually retrieve it as by facilitating a gen
-- eral peace for Europe.
1- TA'o of the deputies, Willot and Quirot,
if attended by Piehcgru and Tallot, as fe
cond3, have been out to fight a duel in the
t, Bois de Boulogne, but were prevented by
the interposition of the police,
d The most marked ill humour manifefts it
d felf on all occalions in the council of Five
Hundred, where the members have entered
>f a very violent protest, and called the Direc
-- tory to account for having dared to order
i- the march of the troops Â©f the line nearer to
t- Paris than the constitution permits. The
Directory was necefiitatcd t.rlhelter itfelf,
i- by throwing the blame on some unknown
le commiflary, though there ean be no doubt
but it was itfelf which gave the order,
if The address of general Buonapare to f.hii
army is very interesting, as it proves that he
jf adts in concord with the Dirgdlory, and is
rs ready to march to his afiiftance.
No communication was at firft permitted
d to take place between the people on board
e- the packet which arrived early yesterday
t- morning at Dover, and tbpfe on shore. ,TUe '
Paris papers werfc not allowed to be taken
f- out for twelve hours after the landing of the
ly meflenger. The dispatches brought by him
c- are kept a profound secret, even from per
sons who are very intimately, connefled with
i- government.

'My Lord,
I beg leave to acquaint your lordship,
that in obedience to your command, I con
tinued off Uflrant with his majefty's-fqnad
ron under my orders, confuting of the fol
lowing vessels, (La Pomone, Artois, An

guns to the southward, I flood round the
weft end of the Saints, and at day break
in the morning of the 17th, I a
frigate, with a ship, corvette and brig, hav
ing fourteen fail of vessels under convoy, in
Hodierne bay; eight of which were cap
tured.
I art sorry to add, that the (hip, corvette
and brig escaped round the Penmarks, and
the frigate, by cutting away her malls, and
being otherways lightened, ran on shore ;
a brig laden with ordnance and naval stores,
came to an pnehor near her, where it was
impoffibfc for the Anfon and Sylph to fol
low. The brig, however, was funk, and
the frigate (La Calliope) much darpaged
In her hull by the (hot of the above ment'-
oned ffiip, whose officer's and men behaved
with the greatcft zeal and aftivity, which
inducts me to hope that the enemy will not
be able to get her off, a3 the wind soon after
changed to the south weft, with a great
swell upon the beach.
I was obliged to burn La Freedom, a
large ihip armce en flute, laden with squar
ed timber, as the enemy had run her on
shore at high water, and the crew, with
their wounded, got away in their boats.
I have inclosed to your lordship a lift of

17th mftant, with a return of the wounded
on board his majesty's brig Sylph.

My Lord,
I have the fatisfa&ion of acquainting r
your lordship, that I had an opportunity of
feeing that La Calliope republican frigate, 1
of thirty.fix guns and two hundred and fifty
men, that was left on shore on the 17th by
the Anfon and Sylph, is totally destroyed, t
having separated in the midship body, and fl
part of her funk. The crew are encamped C
near her bo fate such storeS as may be driven v
on shore. S
I am particularly indebted to captain c
White, of the brig, who having an- ti
chored with springs on his cable, within n
pistol shot of the said frigate on the above 2
day, for some hours kept up an incessant t
and well directed fire, which was at every p
convenient opportunity returned by her. tl
I perceived likewise the wrecks of La b
Freedom, armee en flute, laden with tim- o

were driven ou shore the fame day and de

In obedience to your orders, the Thun
derer bomb was placed by the good manage
ment of lieut. Gourly, herprcfent command- pr<
er, aflifted by Mr. Jackson, master of the the
Ville de Paris, who volunteered his able 10
services, within 2500 yards of the walls of ant
Cadiz, and the shells were thrown from her twi
with much precifiam, under the dire&ion of ing
lieut. Baynts of the royal artillery; but un- â  tro
fortunately it was soon found that a large i are
mortar was materially injured from its fer- j Uli
viees ; I therefore juded it proper for her to ! pol
return under the protection of the Goliah, j feffl
Terpsichore and Fox, who were kept tjnder | fid;
fail for that purpose, and for whose adlual thr
service I feel much obliged. 10,
The Spaniards having sent out a great Ma
number of mortar - gun boats and armed W<
launches, I dire&ed a vigorous attack to be Ka
made on them, which was done with such try,
gallantry, that they were drove and pursued
tlofeto the walls cf Cadiz, and iraift. have
fufFcred confiderablc loss j and I have the <
pleafurt to iufoim two mortar- Bri
let- boats and ao armed launch remained in our

an- fuccefsful termination of tlw contefl to the
gallantry of capts. Freemantle and Miller,
the former of whom accompanied me in my
7- barge, and to my coxswain, John Sykes, who
in defending my person, is mod severely
up, wounded, as was capt. Freemantle, slightly
011- in the attack : and my praises are general
ad- ly due to every officer and man, some of
' whom 1 saw behave in the molt noble mart
in- ner, and I regret it is no> in my power to
3th particularize them. I must also beg to be
my permitted to express my admiration of Don
the Miguel 1 yrafon, the commander of the gun
'ak boats, in his barge ; he laid my boat along
i a fide, and his refinance was such as to honor
ay- a brave officer, iÃgfthe 26 men being kil

Sir,
HAV TNG been appointed by you to
I. "ny.nto effect th e law f or alleviating the
=== d ' Al "* ffes , of OMffeHow-citizeÃs in. this time
,f C , a t y ' at,< * conceiving that the
ejr belt method to pursue is to give publicity to
I 2 our proceedings, as well for the purpose of.
procuring advice in time, as to prevent fun
n.ng into difficulties: Also, that you and
Â»d your fellow citizens may be enabled to judge
how far the money appropriated bylaw may
JT. reach, and means may be made life of in
time, to provide in cafe the calamity should
continue; These coniiderations induced the
Board of Comraiflioners to enter into a lefo
lution, that they would Iranfmit to you a
cur lory ftatejnent of their proceeding's wsck
lyi expefting that proper allowance will be
ITI , re fp e <ft to accuracy, arrifing
from the multiplicity of calls of attention
IS VT? member has > to the necessities of
our flittering fellow-citizens.
>- u F ! On J 4th to 9tU relieved two
hundred and eighty four persons, chiefly
- head ot families, with two hundred and six
ty mtie dollars and sixty five cents, besides a
jj- quantity of bread, account of cost not vet
received.
)e About two hundred and fifty men were
relieved by employment north and south on
the roads, and to open the water courses in
Southwark; so as to drain the stagnated
waters off the low grounds, at 75 cents per
dayâadd to the above, that provilion is to
g- be made, by this Board, for about two
hundred people that have rempved to the
tents, which comramced the 10th instant,
and great increase expefted.âWhen you
consider .his is but the commencement Â»f
our business, you will readily conclude with
us, that there is a probability the numbers
and confsqoenlly expences mavijicrrafe, and
probable double itfelf, before' the calamity
ceases.
f; Your letter of the gtfi inft. haÂ« been .at
tended to, a conference heM vmh
the supervisors of Roxbury and German
town. At we find it difficult to ob
tain the consent of those men that have sam-
S .. t .Â° Â£Â° so far from ho "ie, but in all pro
bability we may be shortly able te draft as
many single men as will answer the purpose :
that, with every other communication from
the governor, will meet with due attention.
That the Supreme Being may ihortly put
a period to the exifling calamity, and restore '
health to our afflifted eity, is the earnest
felicitation of this Board

_ fame paten* thpufÂ«id acres each, the property of ivc
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and lames Avenll
and others, ot tMi State. There it some grounds d *
j to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
t management.â'The Printers will do well to give
jg thiÂ« a place in their papers, as well to caution the cu
public against purchafmg those lands, as also to de
â¢ ' prive those men in future from imposing on indivi
duaft, which their education and addrelsJiave en- ; n
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb hat been f,,
a shopkeeper of some note in this country. fit
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point re
of view the wickeduefs of those men, which when th
the public have perused, will indutc them to ex- hi
