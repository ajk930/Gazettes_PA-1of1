, ARRIVED. Iheii
Brig Eliza, Peterfon, from Leghorn pian
3Â£[C
A Gentleman who camt in the Eliza, politely
handed the following information. 1
Â« The Eliza was captured on hrr outward lher
passage by a corvette of the French repwb chic
lie and earned tp Ajaccia, in the island of re P'
Corsica, and at the expiration of one month
after her capture, was liberated. The ex- on;
pences which accrued in obtaining the libe- to a
ration of vessel and cargo, were very confi- jâ¢'
derable ; as it was necessary to bribis almost cvel
all the public officers in the port. Captain the
Dyre, late of the schooner Variety, of
Dunbury, came passenger in the Eliza, his 0|
vessel was condemned in Ajaccia. His pa
pers weVe in the mod perfeft order; was 1
bound to Leghorn, from Duobury. His
cargo, which was fifh, was aftually caught t0 ,
on board the schooner in which it was ex- eff<
ported, accompanied with every document
to prove it American property; and that 1 * *
the fifh was cured in-the United States. Yet Ma
the whole was condemned as English fifh, I
and aÂ» being English property, upon the
most frivolous and inconfiftant pleas. the
The Eliza left Leghorn the 1 ath August, q U
â¢when it was currently reported that a most I ty
â¢desperate engagement had taken place be- n u
tween the French fleet in *hich Buonaparte bei
had embarked, and the British fleet com- da
manded by admiral Nelson, near the island C al
of Candia. The result was (as was gene- Ei
rally believed) that Bttonaparte was a pn- th
foner on board the Culloden, commodore t h
Trowbridge, and that Nelson was dead. 0 f
One report was, that he was killed in the f e ]
action ; another, that his {hip, a 74, had de
. grapled the L'Orient, the French admiral s l e |
ftip of 120 guns, that After a most trertend- th
Â«us conflift, the L'Orient funk, and before hs
Nelson could clear his grappling irons, he la,
was carried down with her, and all on board la,
perished; that the command had devolved ar
Â£n Trowbridge; and that he captured Bu- ,h
onaparte endeavouring to escape in a small
veflel, which he had ready for that purpefe. hi
From the foregoing, and the accounts C i
which were prevalent in Leghorn, it was e <
generally believed that Buonaparte was a t i
prisoner. The accounts upon this mterek- 01
iticr fobied were very contradidoiy and not Â«
â authentic ; but I took every PÂ«ob-|f c
tain as accurate information as possible and b
it is my that Nelson is dead, and a,
that Buonaparte is a pr.foner to 1 row
bridge. A vessel arrived at Leghorn from si
Alexandria in 30 or 35 day. passage, the h
captain of which reported that the French p
fleet had not arrived it Alexandria, and
that he saw nothing of the fleet., nor heard
of anv engagement: As she Was confign-1
3to a house in the French interests no
doubt, they would inftrua him to fay To.
On the xi July, off Carthagena, the Li-
captain Dixon, a British f.xty-four gun p
ftip, fell in with four large Spantfh frigate,
Dixon to Â«nk= ki< "

the Dorathea of 44 guns and 136 men, by
whom she was condufted to Naples, wher }
/he arrived about the 4th of August. L
The Dorothea bad 30 men killed, an I
ac wounded, who were lent to an hofpita
at Naples. The Lion had one man wound

-ragerrent, was so much encumbered with
her cargo, that she could not fire all he I

THE Board of of the Ma

they deprecate the cOnsequenceS of precipi- D<l

The apprehenfionof the Board has been UI

rÂ° y " several of whom, 'the Board are sorry to t y,
Â° r " add, have been seized with the fever short- m
' ly after their return. a
The weather since the 6th inft. has bean m
extremely unfavourable, anft the number of
l*. thfc sick have considerably encreafed ; which
y ' would evidently be augmented by the accu
mulation of pcrfons, particular!) those from
1 a pure atmosphere. The Board earnestly tv
'| e solicit public atteption ti> coufiderations so
â¢ a C important ; and entreat the forbearance of
their fellow, until returning health shall in- b<
vite them home. _ ra
TheÃo rd cannot too strongly impress a i
the propriety and necessity of cltanfing and di
rom purifying (previous to the return of the in- 0 I
lud- habitant ) the bedding, cloathing, and rc
