s . EXECUTIVE DIRECTORY.
s The Executive Dire&ory, on the report
s I of the minister of general police, having ta
s | ken into confederation, that the bad difpo
s fition which has inceflantly prevailed, from
s the beginning of the revolution, in the com
s mune of Lyons, and which has been the
fa life of many -evils to the republic, still
continues to manifeft itfc-If;
f lit. By the influence of which the chiefs
- of the companies of Jesus, of the afifaffins of
e the South, of emigrants, of deserters and
- of robbers on the highway, all of whom
- find in Lyons and its neighbourhood, a sure
r and inviolable asylum, from the officers of
jufli e, under the pr tetlion of cowardly
t and ill disposed persons.
1 2d. By the impunity with which crimes
of til's kind are daily committed : an impu
nity which arises from the silence of wit
- nefles, and the weakness of the tribunals,
1 fubdiied by fear witjj'which malefactors are
1 able to inspire them.
t 3d. By the obltinate refufal of all good
i citizens to accept "public employments there
- on account of the excefTcs which are com
r mitted,- and the attacks which are made,
, even or the members of the constituent au
- thtirities.
Having taken into consideration also, that
â  the commune of Lyons is one of those
â  which has lead felt the beneficial effeftsof
i the 4th of September, since subsequent to
that day new bands of ma!exaÂ£tors of every
species have renewed their plots, and that
recent provocations have been given by the
young men to the military.
Having, in short considered, that in so
alarminga state of things, it is aot by the or
: dinary powers of the police and admiiiiltra
tion that the execution of the laws, and
the re-establishment of public tranquility can
be produced at Lyons.
Orders, by virtue of the 29th article of
the -law of the sth September.
1. That the commune of Lyons, and
three suburbs of the Red Cross, of La Gu- ;
illotiere, and of Vaife, are put in a state of
siege.
2. In order to carry this measure into
execution, the minister of war will fend
thither, botk in infrantry and cavalry, the
number of troops neccfTary.

PHILADELPHIA,
' MONDAV EVENING, April 16.
The merchants, underwriters and tra
ders of this city, will meet at the Cof
fee-houfe to-morrow, at 12 o'clock, for
the purpose of presenting their Address
to the President of the. United States.
The reports in circulation this day, ref
pefling the receipt of dispatches at the Se
cretary of State's office, from our Envoys
in France, are void of foundation,âno dis
patches having been received.
A new edition of jacobiu lies is now runn
ing through the Aurora.
Publicity is all the cry with the anti-ame
riean-gjillic fa&ion ; when they fuppojt or
know that'a diltlofure involves a derdifti
or.'c.f ail principle-âbut, puliliu!y wfiicli cx
pofts tlic conduit of their employers in its
true colors, is an abomination that their
foul bateth.
The anti-americo-gallieo faflimn have
long piirfued ttieTame coiirfe that the torie3
did at the commencement cf the American
' revolution. The t.ories re.presented ttiis
ci.untry as divided, so dof.be gallic faiflion.
The tories faio the people conlidered t'le in
terest of Great Britain and that of Ameri
ca, as the fame ; the gailic faftion have
gone further, and t >ld the French that the
people of theU'iited States would factifiee
their own iutereft to that of France.
The paral'el might b.; puriued to a preat
length ; but the above are fufheient. Their
fate will doubtless be th.Â» fame with that of
their predecessors the tories.
have a prefsin France devoted to the cause
of this country, but that France ha 3 prefles
in the United States devoted to her interest
is moll true. This is nqt fdir play ; the
French papers in this country ought to be
silent, till we get one at least eltablifhed in
France.
The public arc congratulated on tbe firm
nefs and confidency of the aurora man. It
waÂ« feared by some, from the allusions to a
providence in a late .lumber of Ihe Aurora
that like his countrymen the French he
â¢would adume for a time at lead, ail appear
a-ce of candor and friendfliip to the Unit-,
ed States, in order to wheedle and deceive.
From this apprehenlion we are however ful
ly relieved by his Nejior and Sidney, publi
cations which contain a repetition of the
vile falihoods that have so long abused the
public. â¦

" Every man of principle here that used
to think of the anti-fadtion in Congress with '
some charity now give* them up as rfepro- :
.bates. It has been pretty generajly said,
the party wars are not to be much regarded <
for if danger (hould arise, they will unite,
and the antis will prove as forward and zea- '

have added in England. Jf Mr. Jeffcrfon. a
were Prelident ar.d his friends in office, they '
would not dissolve the braces and tics of 1
government, for they love power more ar-
jdently, and are higher toned and more uftd f
jand inclined to domineer than the federal d
party. But the late most extraordinary
toftduil of the French fadtion has blalled
tbem as men and as patriots ; and every re
flecting man, every man that loves his coun
try and its liberty thinks of them with dread
and abhorrence. Their attempt to repeal S
