When the treaty of '83 was to be tirade with
Great-Britain, the order# so Franlcli:i, Adams,
and Jay, as the French minister here advised, for
bad them to'take atiy step whatever in the negocia
1, lion without the knowledge and approbation of his
court ; which #as leaving it with her to curtail and
regulate our pretentions as would bell Comport with
her own views. bubnefs was tranfafted at I
Paris ; and the burden of it fell upon the two,lad
nÂ»med commiflioners, the other being too old and
ihfiim for an aflive (hare.
rs Trammelled as they found themselves, they ne.
g vertUelefs went on, step by step, as Vergennes the
Ftench dirr&or approved ; till they discoveredâ
s > difco-vered what ? That be was couÂ»tera(3inp them j
a'.d secretly giving Mr. Ofwa!d, the Britilh com
j mifTmner, to understand, that iTiTOttird not l.e n<-
ccfTary to cede the ten itory south weft of the Ohio,
whicfc would be more proper for the Spaniards ;
nor the teriitory north-welt of the river, which it
was but rcafonable fhculd remain part of Canada ;
nor to let us (hare in the fifheries, which were but
fufficient for England and Fiance.
It being time to rilk a breach of orders, Vergen
nes was afterwsrds amused with par.ial commuuica
-0 tions only. And Mr. Oswald tn the mean time had
it fatisfaflorily demonstrated to him, that it wÂ»b
the true policy of Great-Kritaip, if fte acceded to
n oHr.leparation, to let it take place with such limits,
and room for strength and Celf eonfideace, as that
[. we (hould not Mk<~c(Tarily feel a dependence on her
rival. Thus was acquired more than we expected ;
and certainly rauch more tliao France intended we 1
should have.âBut Adams and Jay have never been
forgiven. ]
Of a piece with this specimen, was theeondud 1
, of Fr.anee down to the diflblution of her old go- ( I
. vernment. Nor can it a!as! be said, that " rege- 1
- neration." has made her any better for us; or less 1
r a deceiver and troubler of nations, than ftie had 1
s been for ages before. 1
By as folcmn a stipulation as could be formed, '<
\ w e were entitled to her " offices with the 1
Barbary powers." But so it turned out in cur ]
Fate ncgociation at Algiers, that an agent of the 1
republic was discovered interposing every obftlcle in t
his power, in the way of success. And had hiÂ« (
means happened to have been fufficient, the prison- 1
eis might have rotted in their chains; and our com* c
merce been facrificed to pirates, in order todeprefs t
the American marine, and monopolize the Levaut
trade. c
Unceasing attempts to diftraa and destroy our *
' national government, throw further light upon the p
views ot I'ranee. Disunited, it is well known, the a
ftaies would feel their be more t
manageable by intrigue; might be played off one Â»
again ft another ; aÃd at any time plunged into a f
foreign or a civil war.
It has been thought strange by some, that that t
virtuoso, Mr. Jtfterlon, though embosomed by
kindred philofophcrs at Versailles, should write f
Ivome to embarrass the acceptance of the conftitti. I
tion ; and fiiould ever Cuce remain the pole-star of o
its opponents. And stranger still that while in the o
administration himfelf, he fiiould patronize and pay p
a printer, employed in rendering it fufp'efied and a
odious. But it cannot be concealed that French t!
conjidanti and leaders of anli fedtralifm, are every p
where the fame.
To organise the seditious, controul ele&iens, and c
" flop the wheels of government," Genet planted ft
the democratic societies. A rebellion was the con- ti
sequence ; and was calculated to have spread, and d
terminated in anarchy. The clamour about escife p
was only a cover to the object
The rebellion was in Fauchet's time, who ap
pears to have been well acquainted with it before it
happened ; and speaks with chagrin of chara&ers
that went over to the government fide, because he
had not come up to their price. Since that expe
riment, the plan is changed. As the people are Â«
backward to lay hands on their government, they , f
: mtift be cheated out of it. An administration is to n
be packed; who, by insensible degrees, will either '
frirter tt away, or fubjeft it to foreign influence.

Mr. Fenno,
id, A WILFUL miflake is made by the opponent*
tis, of Mr. Adams in confounding his admiration of
or- the tflcmial and belt patts of a monarchy with the
:ia. monarchy itfelf : and yet there are no tWo things
his more diltinfi : the ejentialpartÂ» of a monarchy are
mo qujlith's which we find irt our own federal cooltitu
ith yonâsuch ?s unity t>f councilâvigour and dispatch,
at- and which give a Jingle executive many advantages
lad over a complicated oneâbut this executive may be
ind limited to a rtrm of years, aÂ» in the United States,
fiill, so far as his powers he is full as much a
ner king as the elective flinnorchs of the antient repub
lic lies, or as the king of Poland. A man may great-
ly admire these qualities of a monarchy, wjthout
n ; wishing for the , introduction of a monarchy here
m- There is no cflential ditfinttion between a kiwg ek-c
---- ted for four ycVs by .the people, wi;!i limited pow
io, er and a President. Tlfe idea tWr jrenerality of peo
ls,{ pie here annex to a monarchy it mult be J
it hereditary; but this u a rrfirtakc ; the king of Po- *
a ; land was ele&cd for lifeâthe doge of Genoa is g 1
itit King under another name. In short, doges, ftadt- '
holderi, governor?, and presidents are all kings un. -
â n- dfr various modificationsâfome hereditaryâsome
â¢a- electiveâfeme foj-fifeâfijme fur a term o/ years
ad we have wifely preferred that, which is the rauft fa
â¢as vourable to publicjibertyâthe elective, f>r a short
to term of yearsâand God forbid we should ever
ti, change itâHill, in deferihing that branch of our '
at goternment, and comparing it with others, we c
er should call it the monarchical or executive part.
1 ; Another mittake is made with refpeft to Mr-. A- '
vt dams.;âln treating of the different antient repub- r
tn lies, fume of which had elcftive, some hereditary
kings or chief magistrates, he describes the various v
ft checks which were devised toreftiain either the am- 1
0- bitioii of the kings, or the pride of the rich, or the '
e- mrbdlenrc of the people, lo as to pi event either the a
in one body or the other from trampling on tlis reft : 1
id when these checks answered the salutary purposes v
for which they were defigncd, lie admires them, as
d, applied to the form of government which existed in ''
ic the coantty he is-d?fcribmg, and as adapted to the "
jr peopjeof that country : the fame kind oÂ£ govern- *
ic ment it not fyitcd to every nation. Indeed we find v
in that even Mr. Jefferftn imagined, that if 20 milli
is ons of American republicans had been turned loose c
1- upon France,;in the year 1782, they would have w
3. dqtlroycd the peace, tranquillity and hsppinefs of 0
fs that kingdom. p>
it To know Mr. Adams'* sentiments of the kind l "
of government, he wishes <o fee in the.United States, ll
ir we must examine his cortduS and lÂ»iÂ» tvotings, as ap- r i
ic plied to the United States ; they ate to the point, n
te and unequivocal : he aided in forming the co.ijitu- w
â¢e tion of Majfachufettt ; let anyW read lift and he h
te will fiod true republicanism in every word ; there is
a proof, direst and unequivocal ; there he was adting, Â®
for his o<wn country, and we fee the kind of governâ¢ c:
it ment be-wi/bed to live under.
y Againâ read his d.fence of the American con- tc
e A ttut tons, where, he speaks of the confitutions of the P'
1. United Statesâwhat does he fay I " That we
>f oagbt to thank God for living in a country, where rc
e our governors and senators are annually chosen by the fu
y peopleâwhere the people are sovereignâwhere there w
d ate no hereditary honors, diftinflions, or officesâ w
f? that we (hall have reason to txult, if we compare our
y government vrith those of any other country.' 7
After these unequivocal proofs, the nun who
can Jty that Mr. Adams wants a change in our con
d ltitution to introduce monarchy or hereditary dif
- tinttions, must not only be blinded V>y the most ri â¢
d diculous prejudices, but fooliflily think that the peo- J ,"
e pie of this country ail all a* blind as himfelf.
