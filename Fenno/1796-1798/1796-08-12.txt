TURIN, May 5.
persons are defirotis of knowing the circrm
(lances which have compelled the king <rf Saidtnia
j to conclude an armitHce by which he fnrrendered
e himfelf to the French. We are allured that after
1 the battle of Mondovi general Colli wrote to the
y court, jhat it wasimpolfible for him, with an army
diiheartened and reduced neatly one half, to Kt;li
, out BUich longer against the French. It was then
e that the king and His council upon the'reprefenta'
n tions of the prince of PicdtnOnt determined to Â»tk
a fufpenfton of arms-although Beaulieu was then
*on his march to attack the French. r lhe French
h general thought of 1 nothing less than grafting a
â  r trace ; however not to give fimplv a negative an
fe fwer he prtlpdfed the conditions expressed in the
at trtaty, not thinking that they could be accepted.
In the interim Chetafco was taken by a coup d.*
main. There then remained no ylaee or poll for.
h- tified between the French army and Turin. Iha
in Freuch , tne>al-faw the Baron de la Tour arrive,
nd who informed him, that his Sardinian majeily had
re I 6gnÂ«d the articles of the Truce, and had given or
daw that they should be complied with as loon as
i possible; The king of Sardinia havisg no longer
I a futScient army to cover Turin, saw as well the
I danger of remaining iu the city as of leaving it*
The inhabitants cried peace, peace, and very pro*
â bably would not have foftained a siege. The fuf-
I render of the capital worfld probably have drawtl
after it that of other places, and the king of Sar
dinia would have fecn the whole of Piedmont con
by quertd and in a revolutionary ftatc. It is supposed
itea that the court of Turin flattered i'.felt with obtain*
h' s 1 ing an indemnification in Lorobardy, and that it
ec ~ I will offer iti"alliance to the French. It is true that
Â£ e t ' s they do not need the affiftancn of the Piedmontefe
! 8 to finifh that conquest ; but it may be to their in
Â»nt, tereft to sngage it in a war with the emperor.
the I The minister of tVic emperor, the count de Ge*
; of 1 rardine', is' returned here ; this has given rile to a
â¢son I great many conjedturei. But as the court of Tu
nc" rin is not at war with the emperor, i: is plain that
ifert a minister cannot quit his pod without the express
order of his court. The princefles of France who

LIVERPOOL, May 30.
A GRATEFUL SEAMAN.
The following anecdote is told of the late Eail
of Sandwich, and {sir Edward Hughes.
Sit Edward, it is known, before his appointment
as Commander in Chief upon the India Ration,
had little -money and many debts. He obtained
that appointment by the friendship of the Earl of,
Sandwich. *
Upon his return, afwr many suitable teflimonies
of refpeft, he seized one moment of cordiality to
extort from the Ea:l a promise, that, whatever lie 1
might next afl<fhou!d not be refufed, if it could be i
granted. He a (Iced accordingly a lift of .his Lord
<hip J s debts. They amounted to one hundred thou- 1
sand pounds, which the grateful seamen paid, be
lieving that he had thus made a new man of his
patron.
But it was not so. The Earl did not {hew all t
his debts ; and what he kept back was enough to i
begin a new lift ; the inconveniences of which bar- i
raffed the latter years of a life, upon the whole, <
more to be pitied, than condemned. 1
A few days ago, the Janus, of Sunderland, fail '
ed from that port on a voyage to the Baltic, but t
kad not been above three hotlVg at sea, before the t
master and crew, to their great furprile, discovered t
that (he took in a large'quantity of water, which t
increased upon .them, notwithllanding the pumps t
1 were kept open ; not being able to find out the j
cause, they returned into harbour, whin, on search- c
ing the vessel, a hole, bored through her bottom f
with an auger, was discovered. On a drift fcruti- r
ny, a boy na Tied Wake, belonging to the (hip, at f
length confeffed that he committed this diabolical ti
deed through an aversion to the voyage, and a de- p
site to go on board another of the owner's vessels v
tiling coast wife. 1 â
SoutVTof wncrc" by agreement,' a number "v
to begin a riotous attack, truf- a
ting for fafetyto the privileges of theit sex. The
magiHraies apprised of the business, oidered out
the fire engines, which smartly among the 0
ladies, with a copious ftreatn of foot and water. 1
They were soon so whimsically bedaubed, and ren- fe

is molt esichantingly situated on the
Rhine, where it receives the Mein ; its site is truly fa<
grand ; and the city, forming a complete amphi- cit
theatre, commands a most luxuriant profpeft. sol
Mentz being 4 Roman ecclefiatlical state, is, of oft
cburfe, not very populous. The nobility have all ab.
fled; and were it not for the number of military coi
in garrison, the place would be a defari. The En
Archduke leaves this town 'very abundantly fur
nilT.ed with ail means of defence. The fortifica* red
tions which eoft the Fiench so much money and rec
labour, were never in so refpeftable a state as at wit
the present moment; and they may, with truth,
be said to bid defiance to-the most extraordinary
efforts of the eliemy, The French are, as they pla
should be, very sincerely detested by all the inha it p
bitantsof \his fortrefs : to receive a visit from that to <
barbarous banditti, and to abhor them, is the ef- tha
fedl of the fame moment. con
Field Maifhal Von Neu is the governor of Metttz.' thei

every mark of attention, however, is paid to the whi
beaters of a passport issued by the British govern ftar<

appearance was taken up here, on fnfpicion of be- com
ing a spy. The town major recogmzed him to have
been a priva e soldier in his own company ;he pas 1
fed himfelt off for a superior officer in Priefs' rejji- vre I
ment. As it is cleaily proved that he is one of the
Jourdan's emissaries, it is well known what fate a- T
waits him. 1
Colonel Crauford is expe&ed here every day ; 011 tl

who is now witbahe Prince of Conde's army, Co- and ;
lonel Crawford, fleam, is as great a favorite with expe
the Imperial army, as he wag among the native L

passed through this place, having government dif- the ]

, was advised at head quarters to take the route to
the Prince of Conde's army, which he did without
losing a moment. /
Serious are the rumours in circulation here.
Some people will have it, that the Pruflian, Han- Tl

Holland, in favor of the Stadtholder, and by no of a n

Augud ri, 1796.
By the J'f'ph, from Liverpool, -we have received a
number of London papers :âthe following from
the Morning Chr'oniclcof May 19, appears to be
the only interejling article contained in them.
LONDON, May 19.
It appears that the SifTatisfaftion of the House
of Representatives at the conduit of the President
in not laying before them the proceedings relative
to the late treaty concluded with this country, is
by no means removed- They consider their condi
tut.onal privileges violated by his refulai, and their
refentraent of the supposed affront may have the
effect to dedroy the good undei(landing between
the government and legislature, aodjierhapS excite
a ipirt of difeftnieni, which it will require all the
wisdom and prudence of thje Prelidetit to appease.
But the lad reiliition, both in its imputed cause
and probable confequj-ices, is more dire&ly inte
retting to this country. Since the beginning of
war the complaints of America on the coriduft or
ourcruifers in the Welt-Indies, have been loud and
orgent; yet, whatever gnfwer may have been made
to the remonstrances of the United States, the
continuance of the injustice augurs no disposition
fairly and completely to take away all appearance
Â°f Sggreffion, and every ground of dispute. Of
the madness and Impolicy of allowing a just cause
of complaint to remain, which, from the date of
the minds of some people in America, would be
converted into the ground of a quarrel to be dread
ed equally by both countries, it is unnecefiary to
fay a word. To inflame their minds at such a mo
ment as this, by toleiating the injuries of which
they complain,' is a conduct of which no confide.-
ration of annoying the power of which we are at
war <?an juftify. If the sentiments of the House
of Reprclentatives are hostile to the treaty, yet
their refufnl to give it their authority is placed, not
upon its difadvaniages and its facrifices, which
declare they would have waved, but upon the at
tacks made by the Britilh government npon the
freedom of their commerce, and the rights of their
neutrality. The reasons of the resolutions they
ave passed, have been fairly and openly dated and
avowed. 'It remains for the miniftera of this coun
try, either to remove the oflenfible cause, or to
turntfh additional arguments for their refufal. By
denying that redress which, if their facts be ad
nutted, the United States of America are entitled
'oc aim, the feeds of aconted mod calamitous to
thjscountry, may be Town ; and the minister Ihould
recollect that he tray hazard something more than 1
' e bare ratification of a treaty, from which he '
turned so much credit, and predicted so much ad
vantage. If past experience be eonfulted, this ,
I - V-'- -- - - - *!Â§EL
country, we may be allured, will be indebted more
, moderation of the American government,
in avoiding the threatened rapture, than to the'
wisdom of our own adu inillration ; for who but
the prefeht ministers would, by aggrefilons fubfe
quent to the treaty, thus endanger the good 08-
e derftandirg which had already been so nearly inter
rupted, byre;i!wing injuries not yet forgotten, and
awakening-pafDons not properly allayed.

ll From the COLUMBIAN CENT IN EL.
The fuccefles of the French on the Rhine, a3
well as in Italy, are confirmed ; and the wreath
- that entwines the brow of Jourdan, threatens to
i equal in verdure riiat which encircles the head of
i Buonaparte. In all the vic'iflitudes of the French
Revolution,âin all the druggies of parties for pre
', eminenceâthe French armies have remained infltx
- ifely pure. We have ofteo mentioned, with applause,
e the exhibit ions of their patriotic, and of their en
- tire devotion to the cause of their country. Nor
will we now be indebted to any other for in elegant
eulogium on them, than one of their own country
menâwho forcibly felt what his heart'didated his
a tongue to utter. We have procured the trarfla
n tion of the following
â e EULOGY ON THE FRENCH ARMY,
And we present it to our readers as a monument
of brilliant imageryâof correct and chade fancyâ
which does honor to the translator, and places him
e far above the cavils of envy, or the fq.uibs of party
t politicians. ,
e The Eulogy pronounced at Paris, is as follows
s \v HAT an immortalluftre is filed by the laurels
!â¢ of vi&ory ; especially when they are engrafted on
r the scion of the beloved Olive. Oh ! thou '
e daughter of Heaven ! Divinity cherished by maii
-11 kindâthe glory and prosperity of Empires the
e strength of States, desired PEACE !âSoon wilt
e thou reign amon?ft Frenchmen 1 Soon our fortu
:. r.ate Republic will resemble a delightful isle which
e fees the irritated waves of the ocean expire on its
fliores ; which enjnys an eternal spring, and which
i, nature embeliifhes with its riched gifts !
f Generous Warriors f The elder sons of the Re
i public 1 The honor of the French name ! It is
e you who will close the temple of Janus ! It is
e you who will give peace to the world, and to whom
n your country will owe all its happiness.
e Patriot Soldiers ! Your fellow citizens prepare
f your crownsâthey will go to meet the conquer
e orsâthey will surround the train, chaunt your ex
f ploifs, and teftify to you their love and their grati
s tude.
Already the adonifhed universe pays you the
j tribute of eulogium and admiration due io your
- warlike achievements :âEven your enemies cf
i teem and fear you.âThey celebrate your courage,
â¢ your condancy, your attachment to your country, 1
t and the example you have furnilhed of military :
; virtues.
t Oh ! may the charms of glory, like the laurels of 1
, viiftory, deck the brow of the patriot-soldier ! How
r sublime ; how truly -worthy of envy, is that noble.at
tachment of the Republican, whose terrible arm de
fends his habitation, his relations, his friends, and the '
: country which gave him birth. He does not echo the
' ftriek of vengeance and furyâterrible in combat, he
strikes the haughty, carries terror into the battalions of (
| the enemy, and overturns squadrons : âMagnanimous
art of viitory 1 Humanity meets him npon the homi
cidal theatre ; where, united, they console and relieve
' the conquered fÂ»e, and repair the affirightful mifchiefs
produced by the fatality of circumstances, or by the 1
terribie laws of necessity. <
Where is the citizen, who does not speak of our 1
, warriors with affedlion ? Who does not fee all the im- ]
portance of the facrifices they have made to their coun
try? Who is not astonished at that hereic courage ; at
that coEftancy, and tbofe surprizing exploits, which '
the annals of hiflory will repeat to our Uteft posterity ! f
He fees in our br;ve brothers in arms, his friends, his '
children, his whole family.âHe (beds tears upon their 1
e woundsâJirticlprifei tfc<sir privation?, fie follows them i
into combatâby his wifiies hp would arrest the fan- ,
e ' guinary ball, and preserve therii all to their country. (
, t In the raid ft of snows, and of froftâupon moun
tains of ice, surrounded by enemiesâkeeping on thy
earthâdeprived of fufficient fubCltence, what has '
'â  been the rondnft of those Warriors! No fooaer does
thechrionof war found, than they seize their terrible I
d arms, and fly to vi&ory, or to death ! What noble mo- <
tives animate them ! What produces in their fouls this
lively enthusiasm I It istheiove ofoui country, which
doubles our physical force, multiplies brilliant anions,
produces patriots, heroes and great men. It is this
noble virtueâthe aggregate of every other, without
which the warrior is only an zflaffin or a vile slaveâ
which guides the Republican soldier, and renders him
terrible to the enemies of his country.
Where is the citizen who can fill the heroic triim- I
n pet, whose masculine force can celebrate foch iÂ«i
---e achievements ? Come forward, the patriot I
'* Writers; paint in traits of fire, theheroifru of our
1 warrioisâcharge yourselves with the gratitude of )
e your countryâSing their united civil and military t
'> virtuesâcelebrate our new Bayards, our Crillons, <
e our B-trkazens ! Happier than those great tjien, i
> they have fought only for their country. What a
? career opened to genius ! What an enthusiasm, what (
â  an intoxication, ought to inflame the song of the
3 defenders of the Republic !
> A few days more, and the citizen and the warri- â¢
- or, will enjoy an immortal glory ! Delightful peace
Â» will scatter our battallions into our vast and fertile
a fields. It will place in thtir victorious hands the

Young Frenchmen ! You are celculated for eve
ry fpecics of glory, the laurels of the fine arts, and
'Â» thole of vi&ory, ought ever to shade your brows ;
'â  putfue your brilliant career! Alike the united def
