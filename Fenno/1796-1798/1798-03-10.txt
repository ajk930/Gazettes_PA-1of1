STAMP ACT.
TUESDAYâMARCH 6.
The hotfc having resolved itfelf into a cjnrr.it'
tee of the mthvle on the bill supplementary to
the a3 for laying a duty on (lamped vellum,
parchment and paper, and the clause for al
lowing per cent, on pur chafe i offlamps
to the value oj dollar: being under con
fderation,
Mr. Harper proposed to fill the laftblank
with 20 dollars.
Mr. J. Wiilinns fuggeflcd th*- propriety
of making the sum ten 01 twelve dollars, in
stead of twenty.
Mr. Harper thought that any person
purchafiug stamps for the purpose of retail
ing tham, would not wish to do it to a lifs
amount than 20 dollars. It was the sum
the fecrctary of the treasury recommended.
Mr. Thatcher was in favor of ten dollars.
Mr. Blount would propose a motion,
which he fupppfed would fcpcrcede the pre
sent ; it was to strike out the firft fedtioa of
the bill, as he did not approve of the prin
ciple of it.
The question was put and negatived.
The iecfe of the committee was then
taken on filling the blank with 20 dollars,
and negatived, there being only 22 votes for
it.
Fifteen and ten were then proposed.
Mr. Blount (aid, to allow this discount
was to lower the duty, and he could not
fee why those who purchased a small quan
tity, ought not to have the fame allowance
with those who purchased a larger.
The question on fifteen was negatived ;
and it was then taken on ten, and carried,
there being 56 vote 3 in its favor.
Mr. Harper moved to fill the blank fix
ing the amount of the discount with
Mr. Bleupt thought 2$ would be fuffi
-1 cient.
Mr. Otis was in fatfor of i\.
Mr. Matthews proposed ten per cent.
Mr. Bayard was of opinion that ten ought
to be fixed upon at firft, in order to induce
persons to purchafr, and by that means get
the stamps well diilributed. The discount
might afterwards be lowered. He believed,
that in England ro per cent, was originally
allowed ; it had since been reduced to five.
Mr. J. Williams was opposed to teu
Me supposed merchants, and others using
any considerable quantity of stamps, would
always take advantage of this discount. He
thought 1\ would be fufficient.
Mr. Blount said it had been Â®bferved that
a large discount would facilitate the distri
bution of stamps. To do this, he suppos
ed was the duty of the secretary of the trea
sury and the supervisors. He wished tokoow
whether there was any thing in this bill, 01
the law, to prevent stamps from being fold
at a higher rate than the law diredted ?
Mr. Harper replied, that by the law,
the secretary of the treasury was diredted
to cause the stamps to be diftiibuted and
fold all over the country, at the price fixed
by law, and no more, without any charge
for paper. And persons being appointed
all over the country to fell them at this price
(for the trouble of doing which they were
to have an allowance not exceeding five per
cent.) a competition would be produced be
twixt them and persons who bought them
on their own account, which would be a se
curity against a higher price being deman
ded, than the real price of the stamp. Mr.
H. thought 10 per nent. too much, and
that i\ would be e proper allowance.
The question for filling the blank with
ten was negatived, there being only 19
votes in favor of it.
Seven and one half and five were then
mentioned.
Mr. Gordon thought that 5 per cent,
would be fufficient, which, with other ex
pences attending the business, would pio
ducc a drdudtion of at least ten per cent,
from the amount of the duty.
Mr. A. Foster said it ought to be recol
ledted, that by allowing this discount,
more money would be brought into the trea
sury, than the bare amount of stamps real
ly used would amount to, as not only those
made use of but those on hand, would be
paid for.
Mr. Lyon would be willing to allow 10
per cent, if he was afTuted that stamps
would not be fold at a higher rate than
at which they are damped : but he thought
there was no security against this.
Mr. Macon differed in opinion from gen
tlemen who thought this per centage would
eperate an injury to persons who used but
few stamps, and consequently could not a
vail themselves of the discount : he believed
they would be mod benefited by it, as shop
keepers would be induced to keep them for
the fake of the profit ; for if they could
only be had of supervisors and colledtors,
persons in the country would upon an aver
age, have to ride twenty miles for a stamp,
whenever they hadoccafion to use one..
Mr. Sewall said it ought to be considered
that persons purchasing a quantity of stamps
took upon themselves the rifle of paying for
what they might not use or dispose of. Be
sides, lofTes might be sustained by perfonr
entrusted to fell stamps by commission, but
none could be had from purchalers, as cash
was to be paid at all times for them.
Mr. S. Smith said, that he was in favor
of repealing the law altogether j but as
this could not be done, he wished to make
it as palatable as he could. Nothing would
renderjit more odious, than to render it diffi
cult for the people to obtain the stamps.
He hoped, therefore, a fufficient profit
would be allowed to induce floTe-keepers in
general to keep them.
The motion for filling the blank with 7 j
was carried without a division.
The clause for repealing that part of the
law whieh laid a,flamp duty on debenture*,
) which was found would operate very Hue
quail)') and enacting in its (lead that
per cent, should be retained in addition *a
the one per cent, now retained on draw
backs.
Mr. Harper moved to fill the blank with
three-fifths which would produce a sum e
qual to that proposed to be raised by the
(lamp duty. â 
Mr. S. Smith hoped the bjank would be
filled with one quarter, which, upon the
debentures of last ye.ir, would produce the
sum of io,o:c dollars. This, he said,
would be a direct tax upon the merchants,
which they could not get repaid from their
cuflomers. He had also doubts as to the
principle. Btfides, it might be forgot, a
few years hence, that this wasacomprom
ife for a stamp duty, and theft iulhuraents
might hereafter be taxed.
Mr. Harper had no ohjcdti.iii to one
quarter. The committee thought it a high
duty ; but they believed it right to fay
what would be equal to the (lamp tax pro
posed.
Mr- J. Williams renewed the motion for
two-fifths. The amount of drawbacks al
lowed, he said, amounted to more than one
third of all the revenue. He had an in
tention of bringing this fubjedt of draw
backs bÂ»fore the house on some other occa
sion, in order to have some alterations in
tioduced into it. He thought two-fifths
ought to be agreed to. '
Mr. Sewall said, he had also his doubts
as to the propriety of taxing debentures, as
it was well known they were given to secure
the drawback upon goods re-exported. The
export business, said he, is of great import
ance, and as to the present drawbacks aâ 
mounting to one third of the revenue, this
was of no consequence, since the duty on
goods imported are intended to be piid by
the consumer, and not by the merchant.â
At present one per cent of the duty is re
tained, which more than ppys all the ex
pences attending the collection jf the im
port duty. Two fifths per cent, would be
more than the proportion which had been
observed in taxing of notes. He hoped one
quarter per cent, would be agreed to.
Mr. J. Williams said, that though the
one per cent, retained on drawbacks paid
the expence of cwlledting the duties, as far
as the centage on the ad valorem amount, it
did not pay also for weighing, measuring
and gauging. He had made some calcula
tions on this fubjedt, but he had not them
now before him. He thought; this draw
back a great advantage given to merchants,
and he was not for lowering the proposed
duty.
Mr. Lyon 1 observed, that he had oppo
sed the Stamp tax here, but he had endea
voured to make the bell of it to his confti
luents, who disliked it exceedingly, by tel
ling them that it would fall heaviell on the
merchants ; but if this article was to be
lowered, this apology would be done away.
Mr. Coit was in favour of the quarter
per cent.
Mr. J. Williams moved that the commit
tee might rife ; but after some obiervations
he withdrew his motion.
Mr. S. Smith said, the gentleman frem
New-York seemed to be much concerned as
to the drawback allowed on goods* re-ex
ported The two last years left to the reve
nue at one pet cent, an average of 40,000
dollars per annum. One quarter per cent
additional would produce 10, coo dollars
more. The whole estimate of duty to be
produced by stamps dollars ;
so that upon onefingle articlealoneone tenth
part of the amount was to be raised ; yet
gentlemen wished to increase this sum by
6000 dollars, tho' out of eighteen articles
upon which a (lamp-duty was imposed, thir
teen of them fell exclusively upon the mer
chants. The gentleman frem New-York
needed not to be afraid of the lauded inter
est, there was scarcely auy thing in the adt
which could affedt them. But that gentle
man was opposed to the bill, and he wifhad
to make it as odious as puflible. Mr S. said
his policy was different ; since it must pass
he wished it to be an unexceptionable as pi f.
fible, as he had now no idea that the stamp.
law would ever be repealed.
Mr. Blount said, the committee of ways
and means had no intention of lowering the
duty; and they only wished to equalise it.
It was calculated to produce upwards of
13,000 dollars, as the law now (lands, and
the present proportion of an additional de
duction of two fifths would produceupwards
of 12,000. He hoped, therefore, two
fifths would be agreed to.
1 The question on two-fifths was pnt and
negatived, there being only 12 votes for it.
One quarter was then carried, without a
division.
Mr. S. Smith then moved to add an addi
tional fedtion to the bill to this effedt :
" Tliat no note, other than Bank
Notes, made payable at or within 60 days
from the date thereof, shall be liable to any
stamp or duty; and no bill of lading liable
topaymore than cents,any thing in the
said adt to the contrary notwithstanding."
Mr. Sewall said, that the part of the law
which this clause went to repeal, imposed a
duty upon a set of men who could not re
imburse it. The duties laid upon merchants
were generally considered as refunded to
them by the public ; but in this cafe, no
such reimbursement could take place. Our
merchants had been greatly injured, it is well
known, by the spoliations committed upon
cur comnacice, by the French, and many
of them are consequently uiider considerable
embarrafTments, and being under the neces
sity of continuing their contrails,from time
to time, would be obliged to pay a high
duty kpon renewing their notes. This
would add to the hardlhips they already buf
fer. As to the bills of lading, he always
thought the duty exceflive, and hoped the
amendment woi.ld be agreed to.
Mr. Champlin said, that the American
merchants were the holders of a very con
siderable part cf the capital flock of all the
Banks in the United States. And es the
stamp-ait new flood, merchants who *r;te
holders of tUf defcriptijn of Stock and
had auy rejociations with the Banks, would
be taxed ia a three fold degree* They
would pay a (lamp-duty frji, upon the etc.
tificate of their stock ; secondly, upon tRM
notes itTued by the banks ; and thirdly,
pon their private rotes made payable, at
within 60 days, to ai;d discounted by the
Banks. And as the amendment propofrd
went to remedy, in some degree, this evil,
and to rentier the aft inqueClion less unequal
and oppteffive in its operation, he was deci
dedly in favor or it.
Mr. S: Smith believed it would be pro
per to divide the question.
It was aceordingly divided, and the form
er part was under consideration when
Mr. Harper said, the gentleman from R.
Island seemed sb confound a bank as an in
flitution with the individuals who .compose
that iuftrtution. Individuals may doubtlef#
pay taxes in three or thirty different ways,
but he could not fee the force of this obser
vation. With refpeft to the motion itfelf,
lie believed it ought not to be adopted.â
He could not fee why notes at 6c day*
should not pay a duty, though he did fee
why they ought not topay so high a dutyas
others, which was the reafou why the dif
tinflinn hndbeen made in their favour. The
merchants, he said, were the mere payers ef
this duty, as they would charge it upon
their merchandise, in the fame way as they
charged other duties and expences. He saw
no reason why the alteration should be made
with refpeft to bills of lading.
Mr. S. Smith observed that it was tery
difficult to convince theoretical gentlemen of
their errors. Practical men will tall you
that it is nnpoffible to charge these dnties
to their customers. There was a duty char
ged on inftrumeuts which admitted 1.-iwyerÂ»
to praftice, he wished tÂ© know how they
could be charged to their clients. Wheu
this fubjeft was originally before the com
mittee of ways and means, after well con
sidering the fubjeft, 60 days notes were
excluded; but when the bill came into a
committee of the whole, gentlemen, defir.
ous of defeating the bill, introduced such
tilings into it as might have a tendency to
; damn it, arid this was the reason why 60
days notes were introduced. These notes
he said, did not come under the design of
other bonds and notes. They were now
become the passing medium of this country.
To tax them was the fame as -to tax everv
dollar that Went through his hands, as all
purchases and falcs were made by notes of
this description. Mr. S. said he was awate
of the difficulty of impressing a body like
this, in which there is so little commercial
interest, with the impropi-iety and hardfliip
of a meafare of this kind. And as "infigni
ficant as some gentlemen might think this
duty, he could inform the committee that
one merchant in Baltimore had gone into a
calculation of what the stamp duty would
(land {iim in, anchhe supposed it would be
at least 800 dollars; and a house in Philadel
phia had informed him that their (lamp du
ties would amount to 1200 dollars, of
which they never would be able to get a
cent from their customers.
Mr.Harper could not help congratulating
the house upon this information. He hop
ed there would be many persons of the de
scription which the gentleman frorl Mary,
land had mentioned. If so, this tar would
prove an extensive fouree of revenue,
refpeft to the lawyers, he believed they
might be fafely trusted to get back Whatever
they paid.
After Mr. Champlin had said a few words
in reply to Mr. Harper, the question was
taken on each part of the feftion separately
and nigatived.
Mr. J. Williams then moved an addition
al feftion, to exclude from duty all bonds,
bills and notes, under 50 dollars, whieh
was negatived without debate.
The committee rose andche house concur
red in the amendments.
FRIDAY MARCH 9.
A meflage was received from the Senate
informing the house, that they hail receded
from their amendment to the bill providing
relief for the widows and orphans of certain
deceased officers. It will be recollefted that
this was a propofitioe to strike out militia
cjfic rtâwhich being receded from, relief

The committee will perceive, that the
principal fwm expended since the last ftffion
of Congress, has been upon Fort-Mifflin, in
the state of Pcnnfylvania. This fortrefs,
from several confederations, fecmed intitled
to particular attention. The ground on
â which it (lands, and necefTary to it, has
been ceded to the United States. The
works, as far as they have been ere&ed,
were composed of good materials, and put
together in such a manner, as to promise
long duration and utility. An experiment j
bad 1 kewife shewn where the workj were
dolt vulnerable, and that the fortrefs may
be rendered competent, with certain auxila
ry works, to afford an efTential prottftion
te an important commercial city, against the
operation* of a powerful naval armament-
It has, therefore, been deemed proper, un
der thetruft committed te me by the Presi
dent, to contemplate completing this fort
refs as expeditioufly as possible.
The Secretary has suggested, on a form- '
er reference, that to derive real advantage
from any considerable expenditure of money
for completing the seaboard fortrefles, the
military ettablifhmrnt should be such, as to
admit of their being occupied by garrisons
equal to keeping them in a tenable situation
and to the preservation of their flores and
artillery. It is certain, that this cannot be
done by militia, unless when called into ac
ual service, and that no part of the regular
force employed on the Western frontiers,
can be tranferrcd from thence for such pur
poses, without endangering the peace of the
union, and openiug the way, in that quar
ter to the immediate execution of projeds
and enterprises, contrary to law and treaties
and fubverfivc of all order and government.
It is but too evident, also, that the course
Â®f things and circumstances, peculiar to the
frontiers (huts out any well-founded expect
ation, that we have approached near to the
time when the military force may be fsfely
diminished or withdrawn.
Independent therefore ef considerations,
resulting from our present situation, with
refpett to foreign nations, it would appear
necefTary and proper, that the seaboard for
tifications should be generally improved, and
this defence of onr country rendered ref
peilable, and also that the army should be
proportiouably augmented. A regard to
ultimate economy will require, that such of
the fortifications as may be always import
ant to the general defence, (hould be con-
AniAed, like Fort-Mifflin, of the mod du
rable materials.
It may be proper tomention, that befide3
the want of men to garrison these forts,
there is aoather difficulty which it is desi
rable should be removed. But few of the
states have made cessions of land, on which
forts have been or ongbt to be creifled for
the proteftion of their harbours ; a circum
ftar.ee calculated to impede such underta
-1 kings, and embarrass the intentions of gov
-1 crnment to provide fortheirdefence. Neither
is it known to the Secretary that any of the
satcs which were found indebted to the U
tn'ted States on a settlement of the accounts
between them and the refpeftive dates, have
thought of availing themselves of the third
io* of the " aft tÂ« provide for the fur
thn defence of the ports and haYbonrs of
ilit United States," pÂ«3ed the 23d of June, fu
1797. ... ' M
The committee will perceive, that many in
good causes have preventeda greater expen- n>
diture of the appropriations, and that while
these continue to exist, they mult inter- j
rupt the completion of our maritime defence
by fortifications. E
With refpeft to the la ft enquiry of the C
committee a full consideration of all the cir- w
cumftances, induces the Secretary :o an o- cc
pinion, that a further appropriation (hould th
be made, to be in readiness, and commenfu- t
rate to meet such a state of things, as may
require our parts and harbors to be prompt
ly and completely fortified, whether proper ' 1:
fcites be ceded or not by the Hates more im- ar
mediately concerned. , i t,:

LONDON, JAN. I.
In our paper of the 25th ult. we menti
oned a plan for the invasion of this country
by the French, of which citizen Monge is
said to be the projeftor. Of this plan we
gave the following as the outline.
" Thirty rafts are to be built; they are
tÂ® be composed of efiormous quantities of
timber, connefted in the strongest manner :
they are to be provided with parapets of tim
ber and hides, cannon proof, with artillery
1 and furnaces to heat the red hot balls; they
are to be navigated with fails, oars and rud
ders ; each is to bring over 10,000 men,
making in the whole 300,000, with a due
proportion of horses and field artillery; they
are to proceed from different ports of France
and to attempt a landing in different parts of
this iflsnd. Their red-hot balls are to fcrve
to rept.l th* attack of a fleet of battle (hips
' while their own immerfioa will render them
- incombultible, Their small draft of water
1 will enable them to approach the flatteft
: c<saft ; their enormous bulk, covering a
- great number of waves, will prevent their
- being much agitated by the motion of the
- sea ; and by means of draw-bridges affixed
- to them, each raft will disgorge its myriad
upon the English (hore!"
By a letter from Yarmouth, which we re
: ceived this morning, and which we now lay
f before our readers, it (hould seem that the
e ; French government is about to put in exe
s cution Monge'B plan:â

Friends and Enemies to their Country.

at " Those are enemies to their country,
at who, whether they are u~permoft or not,
i- prefer the iritereft of Great Britain before i

a It it a fafl well remembered, thit during the
late war, it|fo happened that in the excursions of
the British army many persons who called them
fclves tories, and hoafted or their attachment to
c _ the royal cause, were taken prilbners and plun
of dered by themâand whan they reminded the
le- British of their principles, they frequently fared
the worse, ar.d were damned for traitors to
their Â»\rn country. It has been said, that some

British and. French Factions.
So much has been said of a British and SI
French faftinn in this country, that a (Irang
er might be be led to believe, that the peo-. B
pie of America were but puppets, set in mo
tion by wire-holders, on the other fide of the SI
water. But how tn'ich foevcr the
ons we arc in the habit of making, may tend B
to juftify this degrading conclusion, lam R
one, who can by no means, fubferibe to it. 2;
Let statesmen though, and diplomatic men, fe
speak for themfclves. I mean not however S;
to quarrel with the tetms, since they very C
well serve to designate the parties which di- tl)
vide us; and since it has become our desti
ny, to draw writh one or other of the great
European powers, let them be known by m
the namesof thi British and French faftions. fc
Ia this view then, I am heretical enough,
to profefs myfelf to belong to the former, w
Not bccaufe lam a trader, whose interest m
leads me tfl this fide. Not because di
I have been secured by British gold.
I am an ohfeure individual, by much o
too infignificant, to be the objeft c/f a bribe
(if bribes were goin*) and too remote from d
the concerns of trade, to be in the smallest
degree a(FeftÂ«d by them. The magic I pof- ci
fefs, said the wife of Marshal D'A ncre, is o
the ascendency of a ftrrtng mind over a weak
one, and the influence lam held by, (if I c
know myfelf,) is merely, that of a good
cause over 3 bad one. If the padions of f
men were made to last for ever, and true
steadiness Â»f condu&, confilted in a blind
and doltish adherence to founds inftcad of t
things, in defiaace of every change of cir- v
cumftance and situation, then both pallion t
and principle woald place me on the other t
fide. But since in the best of our natures, 11
we are differently constituted, and as in this '
" ftrapge eventful history," to " preserve (
our cwnfifteticy, we often find it neceflary to ,
vary our means," Ido not blush, to be found t
where I am. I call it a good cause, because i
I consider it the cause of order, liberty, mo
rality and religion. Unhappily it has been
too much difcreditcd by names, as the other
| (in every refped itsreverfe) has been exalt- '
!ed by them. But words will not for ever '
j usurp the place of things. Those of liber
| ty, patriotism and philanthropy, have been
too mutfb abused, much longer to impose on
; the molt credulous, and our Jacobins are
â  in a fair way of being left to themselves.
| But as lam a member of the British fac
-1 tion, from a persuasion, that in this way, I
1 best promote the true intercfts and happiness
of my country, so the cOmposers of the
: French one, have objefts no less dear to
them* which they hope to advance, by their
1 adherence to it. A similarity of views, a
t fondnefs for power, and a preference of the
: short cut to it, by gulling the populace by
- jacobinical cant and pretentions to superior
3 purity, infltad of acquiring it by the flow
f atid well earned fame of manly virtue and
1 integrity. Thtfe are the ties which rivet
s them to our dear allies. These are the qual
ities for which they admire the French, the
- views for which they cherish their cause, and
e flock to their standard. Nor with the most
1 fulfome profrflions of philanthropy in their
e mouths, do they blush te espouse the cause
1 of these monsters, who with the very fame
e profeflious, committed their most horrid en
y ormities. But the philanthropy of a J3CO
- bin only comes from the teeth. It has no
Â» connexion with the heartâand indeed gross
il pretensions to humanity, are always to be
t- fufpcAed. The man ef real feeling, difco
d vers himfelf in adiions, not in words, and
r Shakespeare, asd other accurate obferversof
n human nature, often give to characters of
â - this cast, a certain tin<9ure of asperity
ir Jacques, in As you like it, does hot furfeit
d us, with sentiments of Fraternity, or turn
:r our ftomachswith nauseous doses of his love
), and adoration of the people. Jacques it is
I true, is no candidate lor popular favor, and
much do I fear, that 110 real friend to his
species, will ever poflefs the talents for this
charming attainment.
But though the standard of Jacobinism
may at length be deserted, by all who have
a claim to honest intention, yet will it still
be ably supported. It will be resorted to,
r by the out-cafts of every country. It will
j be thronged by the hypocrites of all denom
,e inations. Religion, having been long thrown
, s i aside, as a thread-bare and useless disguise,
|r that of patriotism and philantropy, has been
aflumtd in its stead, by the scoundrels of
e the day; and were Moliere now living, and
lashing the age, his Tartuffe would not bea
devotee, but a patriot,
ir As this vice of hypocrisy, (themeaneft
; in the whole catalogue,) is the very oppo
>r site of candor and generosity, so is it pecu
ir liarly detestable to the pofTefTars of these vir
d tues, whom therefore, the modern Tartuffcs
justly consider as their natural enemies.â
Hince, their implacable enmity and eternal
e war with persons of this descriptionâand
thelre is no surer mark of a manly difinter
v efted chara&er,-than that of being the ob
n_ jeÂ£l of Jacobin venom.
>e I think too well however, of the doftrines

0 become a theatre for the uncontroled display
, 1 of the philanthropic malignity and infernal

ir But if matters should unhappily be driveii
to extremities, I tiuft, that these outrage

will vary according to circumstances, fcidom ex

against fin.J from within, and two from extra ha
laruoiw buildings and octcupations in their nei<b

ceeding 4000 dollars ; but if more than this fom
is required to be insured in one tenemc7t, an addi

circumllances.
11. lnfurances will also be made on buildings and
goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to the risque. BuC it it not cafy to arrange the fe
under particular heads cr clafTea, so as to dcfcribe
each with the neceflary accuracy. Each caf- must
therefore lie dtcidedupon according to the circum

in general, appear from the dcfcriptioo accompÂ«-

Bu flings partly conftru&cd ef brick or stone,
are preferable to those wholly wooder. And in
both cases, the stile of building, how they are oc

buildings, and how occupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And with refpeS tÂ» goods,
their tendency, whether froui their nature, or
from the matmiw in which they are expo fed, ether
to commence or to increase an accidental fire, and
their li&h.lity iu such state to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden and hafly removal, or to be (to

proportioned accordingly.

ift. The Insurance is net binding till the stipu
lated premium be paid ; but it (hall be deemed ef
fectual from the time of such payment and acci-p

ad. lnfurances may be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of thepelicy, withrut further ex
penseÂ« than the payment of the premium of the re
newed term, the circumstances continuing the fame
as they were understood by the Infuri rs at the time
thelormer insurance was marie ; but the payment
of the premium isyeffential to such renewal; and
if the party insured fufters any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; Hor can the insurance be renew
ed on the former policy but by computing the
commencement of the renewal from the expiration
of the former insurance. The fubjefl of insur
ance may nevertheless be open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. If any other insurance be made on the fame
proporty ; itmuft be made known at the time of
application, otherwise the policy made on such ap
plication will be void.
4th Goods held in trust, or on consignment,
may be insured as such in a separate policy; but
they are not to be considered as infuied stherwife.

or by reason of any civil commotion ; or occasion

nor are paintings, -Dedal', jewels, gems, antique
