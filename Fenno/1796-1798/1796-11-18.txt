plains the writer's meaning. He observes, " That
there is already a fciliion, m the national alterably,

We shall not trouble tbe eleftorj with any obser
vations on this explicit passage, nor with further
quotations or remarks upon '* the Discourses upon
Davila." It is generally believed that Mr. Adams
was the writer. We fully credit the afTertion, be
cause we never heard of the flightefi denial or coun

between thafe discourses, and his books concerning
the American couftitutions.

A disguised Anti, muffled in a Federal cloak,-
who is publilhiug lonÂ£.j,vinded essays .against Mr..
Adams and panegyrics on Mr. Jefferfon, is sup
posed to be a certain officer of the federal govern
ment, known to be diflatisfied with the present ad
ministration because some ridiculous pretentions have
been overlooked. He expects undet a new one,
to rife mote rapidly. There have been heretofore
complaints against the tardiness and neglect of this '
officer, occafionedjby all employment of that time,
in writ in,' fcflays agatrTtt the treaty and the govern
ment, which his duty fheuld have applied to the
pwblic service. A mifpenfe of his time, in (l.:n- '
dering Mr. Adams, will probably produce limilar 1
complaints hereafter If a public officer is dif- 1
gulled with the adminillration, be onght to resign, 1
and not pocket the public money while he is injur- '
ing the public service by a neglect of duty.
A man of pride End spirit would ftorn to aft '
with ait administration which he is working to un
dermine, or to be the servant of a government he
*vifhes to overturn. None but a mean and fordid
tool would aft the part of a concealed enemy, grin
ning smiles in the face of those whose reputation he
t is llabbing behind their backs.âAs to his pretended
aversion to the Rrit'ifb conftitutipn, it is more pre
polterous than all the reft of his cooduft Does
he think the ftoiy of a certain laurelled and tri

" The French Government within these 8 days e
has recalled Mr. Adetâhe will make some declara- !

a- of his country cease with him, till fomeYuture more I

id 'Tisthought Spain has ceded to France part of f

they think their schemes will go better forward v j
whilst they have no Miniller in the country. Per- 31
haps their policy goes to join our back settlements "

the guarantee of the Spanilh settlements in Ameri- .
ca'is the equivalent for LÂ«?uifiana. Therefore our U

' e Extract of a letter from Franklin county, dated ai
November 14th, 1796.
" There is but little news here worth communi- h;
s eating. I'he anti-federalifts were busily engaged
for feveTal weeks previous to the 4th of November m
in circulating hand-bills and fallhoods through this

_ counties there was scarce a rascal to be faund that , a
r had rendered himlelf conspicuous by heading a mob

haÂ«i not been addressed upon the fubjeft of the late R
election, tlianked for his former patriotic feryices,
and folicitcd again to exert himfelf in the cause of t )'
liberty and equality."
It has been whispered in private circles by fomty "
zealous partizans that we mull expect a visit in rÂ°
' some of our ports between this and the firfi IVed- Â«
e nefday in December by the French squadron which ui

connts for the escape of Drouet, Babceuf and o

From the Aurora. cl
y 10 relieve in feme degree the impatience of the
|, public, as to Mr. Adet's lad note to oar execa- V a
tive, v.-e promised an outline of its contents. We C o
. fulhl the talk, with as much accuracy as is compa- pr
t tible with the brevity we are obliged to observe, and a n
r the intricacy of the fubjeft. tr
â _ The miniller of the French republic, through '
t the whole of his note, speaks 33 acting under the ve
. express orders from the executive directory.
f After exprefiing the attachment of his govern- I l ]
j ment for the American people, he complains, in the m<
. name of the directory, of a violation, on the part r ;
. our executive, of the 17th article of the treaty of th,
> 1 Â£ u j
t The firft part of that article stipulates, that the
1 French (hall be at liberty to bring their prizes ir.to we
our ports, without its being lawful for any of our tha
officers to take cognizance of their validity. In in
contempt of this (lipulation, he states, that several
i'rench prizes,, brought into our ports, have been p r
feiy.ed, tried, and rettored to their original owners, f er
w.th various degrees of delay, vexation, iniuftice, w
and injury. 1 vv
He complains, that the English were fuffered to
aim in out ports, in various inilances, and that the
complaints of the agents of the Frecnh republic
'V? P rov ed mcffeftual in (lopping them. Persons, da<
impeded of having assisted in arming French pri- the
vateers, were immediately thrown into prison, while tio
thole concerned in arming Britilh vessels, were ne- ftei
vcr molcftedâThe executive, in these instances, mi,
exhibiting an evident partiality for the English, the
and no regard for the maintenance of their neutra- not
lity.
11 - hC ft 'P u , latlon Â» in art 'cle 17th, ptsohiSits to]
all Eoglifh (hip., tbÂ« /hsll have made French pri fide
n, zes, frona entering our ports. Oiir executive Lave, >
ill in their conflru&ion of this fbpnlation, confined
its prohibitary effedl to British vessels attempting
it, to come in with their prizes. The minister protests,
of in the name of the directory,,againft the propriety
it. of this conflruftion. He considers it an attempt,
o- to add to, not to explain the article. Even on the
e- supposition, that the article is doubtful, he infills i
n- on the impropriety of an ex Jtarle conftruftion. He i
cites sundry examples of English (hips of war hav- i
le ing entered our ports, contrary to this stipulation,
b- having made them convenient stations the better to
t, annoy the Prench, and having, even contrary to â 
t- the forced interpretation given to the 17th article '
is by our executive, bro't their prize 9 into our potts, 1
;n Sc there refitted them, to cruize againfl the French. -
:o The mimfter next adverts to Jay's miffian. He
re dates, that France was deceived by the declarations t
:y , of our executive', when that business was set on 1
; foot ; and that the dirpftory confioers the British c
m ; treaty as depriving France of all the advantageous t
j ftipulaticns intended to he secured to her by the j
treaty of 1778 âas tending to render the neutrali- t
ty of America.advantageous to the English, to the J,
detiiment of France.
This treaty abandons the modern law of nations
a , which even England had fanftioned in eleven treat
J | ties, and we in every prior commercial treaty with c
j European nations. It gives the English the facili
j. j ty of obtaining the transportation of naval itores
n 1 and warlike implements witherfoevei they please, t
j vinder the fhclterof the American flag, while this t
y facility is denied to France; and thus it changes v
j. during the war, the refpedivc footing of the belli- p
rj gerent powers with refpedt to us. The treaty, he t
further slates, cuts off the fupplics in provision v.
j which France looked for from this country, by fti- t
j pulating, that the Britifli may, in every situation, fl
seize our provifion-vefft'ls bound 10 the ports of their t.
enemies. 111 short, hi considers it a breach of our C
neutrality,, unless the French be allowed to partake r
in the advantages it holds out to Great Britain.ân si
He also daims this participation in pursuance of the a
e 2d article of the treaty of 1778, which grants the I:
n French all the advantages ofcc I merce & navigation tl
e enjoyed by the mod favouied nations : and in this h
; point of view, the orders to the Fiench vessels of o
war, to treat the American flag, in every refpeft,
j- as we shall fuffcr it to be treated by the English,
have been issued. '1
' The miuiflei proceeds to protest in the name and
by the orders of the executive dirc6hiry against the 6
. violation of the 17th article. He claims replevy of C
all seizures, and the aonullisg of all judicial afls
with refpeft to Fiench prizes, and protests against n
t all oppofitiotf to the sale of prizes.
He protefls against the violation of the fame ar
ticles by our admitting into our ports Britifli arm
j ed vessels, and against the interpretation put to it
! by o'.:s. executive upon that article. p
He'declares that the directory considers oilrtreaty D
with Britain as a violation of their treaty with us ; C
and as equivalent tj> a treaty of alliance with that Â®
nation ; and, in consequence, orders him to suspend
his minifleti.il functions here. v y
The diredtory declare, that they do not wish this jj
measure to be confidercd in the light of a ruptnre, K
1 a -rnatkof thtir feiife of injury, which is to
bit until they can olitain fatisfaflion. They reite- C
rate their expressions of friendfhip for the PeopW
the wrongs of the executive.
The minifLr concludes by dating, that the French ; j
Republic always jjad it at heart to truhivate harmo jj
ny by a mutual interchange of goad offices; but Si
that our adniiitiftration hive as constantly endeavor- A
ed to break a/under the ties which conlitdt the two
nations. Early under the Republic, the French L
colonies were opened to 11s ? the ports cf-France al
so on the fame footing as to their own vessels.
When England violated the neutral flag, France o- F,
bliged to make use of reprisals, exempted from the G
mejifjure the Americans ; aridtho' forced for a while $
much against their inclination, to withdraw the ex
emption, they early renewed it.
While France was thu3, even during the tempest
of revolution treating the Americans with mark-
ed attention ; what, asks the note, were the execu- m
tive of the United States eijiployed in ? They were
questioning whether they would acknowledge the
republic and receive their ambassador, whether they
fiiouid consider the treaty, the price of American
liberty, binding, whether the envoys from exiled
and rebellious princes (hould be received ; an am
biguous proclamation of neutrality was framed ;
French privateers were harraffed ;,England was fi?F- fr
feredto sport with our neutrality, and to cut up
our commerce to the detriment ef France ; English
(hips of war were admitted in our ports ; *the ad- E
vances of France for a renewal of the treaty of in
commerce weie eluded under the mod frivolous
pretexts, while our executive courted the British c
and solicited a tr.aty by which prostituting our neu
trality we facrificed France to her enemies.
And this whilst a review of fate events, whilll e
very cbjedt around, (till remind ns of the tyranny
of Britain and the generous assistance of France p
The note concludes by calling on Americans to re
member, that if generous minds are alive to inju
ries, they can forgive ; and that the Fiench when
they are treated;as friends, will flill be found faith,
ful friends ancUgenerous allies. gj
The lupplies which France expefied in her Colonies
were cut off ;by our virtually acquiescing in the principle, CI
that a declaration from a Britifb commander placed them n!
in a ltate of blockade.

About the ill of Odtober last, from the plantation of
Mr. Thomas F. Brooke, (in Prince George's county) to
whom he was hired, a NEGHO MAN, named CiESAR;
33 years of age ; about 5 feet Bor 9 inches high; well j
made; of a yellowilh complexion ; a little pockmarked:
has, whenfpoken to, rather a down look, and submissive 1
, tone of voice: the clothes he had before he abfeonded
were of plain, such as labouring Negroes usually wear,
but these he may probably exchange for others : he will a *=
doubtless endeavour to pass for a freeman, having, as I
have been informed, assumed the name of Butler : I have
reason to believe that he went to Baltimore, from whcnce â
he is said to have gone to feme part of the Sufquehannah,
' probably with a view of getting to Pennsylvania. A
reward of Thirty Dollars will be given to the pcrfon who ,
! may take him and so secure him in some jail tha: I may
get him again, if taken in this state, and Fifty dollars if or
taken out of the state, and if brought home or feenred in fa _
the jail of Prince George's county all reasonable charges w
will be paid by ALEXR. COVINGTON. toi
