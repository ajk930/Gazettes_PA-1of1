Dtfplantier.âDoes it correspond with
the constitution ? Does it correspond with |
the happiness of the people ? Does it cor
. respond with the peace of the. interior, to
favour the excesses which the indefatigable
apostles of anarchy wish to renew ? They
fay that the 353 d article of the confti'uti
on is in their favour, but this article con
cerns only the friends of order, and not t
those mho have dug sepulchres for the
French nation, and whose doftrine is de-
ftruftive of all social order.
Arsenals of revolt, warehouses of (nfur
reftion ate established; a set of banditti
Wish again to sway upon' the fcanold the
sceptre of terror.
But their pratricide projects are known : { |
the anguish of having conceived them is all
that is left them : liberty is so confirmed,
that one gesture on her part will rally round
her all good citizens, and manifeft the dif-
grace, the infignificance, and the infamy j
of her hypocritical vctaries. '
It is for the wifdotn of legislators to pre
vent the combat from taking place. To {
prevent the evil is now to do a great deal.
Recolleft the origin and the history of po
pular fqcieties. Doubtless we owe grati-
tude to these foeieties for the good that
they have done, but by adding to this, sen
timent a positive resolution not to expose
ourselves to them again, a blind resistance to
salutary reforms called forth the resistance
of the paflions.âThere was not one French-
man, an enemy to abuses, who did not wish
to co-optrate in their annihilation. This
enthusiasm peopled the popular foeieties,
but we soon saw them degenerate. Men
fond of money and of power direfted the
operatious of these civic aiTerablies, and Qr
every step in their career was a monument
of their violence. \ '
The 9th Thermidor arrived; France,
disengaged from the yoke of the Jacobins, QU
got time at last to breathe, and their crimes co]
were brought rÂ» a period. But now they | a p
ft ill pretend to influence your deliberations, u j,
to aflbciate themselves . your labours, and
to direst your steps. Vou applauded with
energy the directory when it'eaufed the
pantheon to be' shut: you will sot fiifFer J, u(
those miscreants to reorganize their cursed ]
band,'and to render you incapable once t j, e
more of realizing the hope of your consti
tuents, and of drying up the source of j an(
your cslamities. cj
â¢ We have certain information that popu. f u ] {
lar foeieties are established in a great num- on ],
ber of the departments, and that they me- er
nace the public tranquillity. You know t0 j
that there are already a great number of j
this fort in Paris, who exeite the anxiety tee
and the vigilance of the couftituted autho- tent
rities. You have just grounds for alarm, t j cr
since all these foeieties are compofea of f tcn
ultra-revolutionists, who have retarded in f e( j
place of accelerating the. progress of the â¢ '
revolutionary chariot ; of evil geniufles who c( j v
wifli at any price to aft a part upon the prcv
political scene ;of ambitious men who are Â£
astonished at not having been the-people's 0 f t j
choice; of men, who, decorating them- v ,r lo
selves with the fine names of the Roman t j ian
republic, have plundered and mafiacred at was
all hands, and who never bluflied but in eil( j c
the blood of their fellow citizens. corr(
What can be the operation of aflemblies nc , ]n
eompofed of such fulphureous l nam{
if it is not confufion and terror ? Dread the g,
eruptions of these new revolutionary vol- jj"
canoes ! Have they not dared to fay that [ la jj '
the representatives of the people were tr; "ky
Chouans and Rovalifts, and that they wish- j-, nÂ£r
ed for the re-establishment of tithes and
feudal rights, because they wished t,o re- j)
store liberty of worship, because they did t0 t jj
- Hoi wilt to perfccute the fmmftera 0i reli
gion, and because they were occupied with
the fnbjeft of bells ? Have they not dared
to fay that they supported a fojreigri faftion
beeaufe they repealed revolutionary laws,
and recalled to Franc Â« those whom terror
- had fugitated from her territory I Have
mas they not dared to fay that they were coun-
War, ter-revolutionifts, because they manifefted'
'7- _ a determiaation to prosecute rogues; and to
tuni- put an end to their dilapidations ?

fare- against you ; the furies already talk of the
cannon of Vendemiaire ; of battalions, of

a left j agreed upon, they only want the signal for
does | battle. , Yes, they wish for"an infurreftion ;
uder I nocturnal aiTemblics are increasing, and Pa
lever 1 ris is overflowing with the Jacobins who
ntry , have inundated France with blood and tears,
uted I have met here two who have been the
con- 1 robbers of my department, and jtliere is
nnot perhaps none of you who cannot fay as
I much.
J All temporizing will be fatal, and bring
1* R, 1 on a catastrophe in which not only you, who
ion, possess the esteem and confidence of your
favy j eonftituents, and who would find defenders
J. and avengers in everyone who is friendly to
j good order and the government, but all those
it a- who shall take a part in the business will be
this involved.
fri- j Do you know what the Jacobins -are ca- 1

not- Brumaire, 3 d year, <â¢ Where has tyranny
non had its supporters and its satellites ? In the (

I Jacobins. If you do not pronounce with I s
the j courage you will no longer have a republic]
s in 1 yoH will have no more liberty because you
nty I will have Jacobins And, I add, because
d." you will have popular foeieties, and pretend- f
ed constitutional circles.
They havs circulated a repÂ®rt in the de- t
partments that some of the representatives 11
of she people have been afTaflinated, because I
they v\rifh to famih'arize the public mind 11

destroying these foeieties, which, like can- I r

the greatest importance to announce to the |
; people, that we are not reduced to the me- I
lancholy neeeffity of organizing popular so- I G

PARIS, July 19.
Five of the old ministers have been dis
missed. Of these five ministers, two may
flatter themselves with carrying off the cci>Â«
tempt of the whole nationâthese are Charles
la Crpix and Truguet. They are replaced
by Talleyrand Perigord and Pleville Pe
ley. These two choices are generally ap
proved. Talleyrand Perigord will soon re
pair the folly of De la Croix ; with such a
minister, we may hefire that the tranquility of
Switzerland will not be dijlurbed; and that
â¢we fuallnot imur the scandal of commencing a
new war with the United States on the day
on which wef.gn a peace with the kings of Eu
rope, and on that day so much desired, ou
which Talleyrand Perigord is appointed to
accelerate it.
A private letter from Vienna of the 9th

Brujfels, July 22. " The greater part
of the division commanded by gen. Ruhe
penfe, is crofling Namur to the interior of
the republic. It is oertain that a great
niimbeV of troops from all the armies has
received orders to.repair to Paris and the
environs of that capital. Malicious reports
have already been spread among these troops,
who are made to believe that a royalist
counter revolution is on the point of taking i
place immediately, and that government has
reeaurfe to them in order to prevent it.â-
Whatever be the object of this, the fad is
certain, and it is chiefly with the lighter
troops that this is attempted."
The 11th Thermidor, Gen. Hoche re
ceived at Gueldres an order from the minis- ;
ter of marine for a secret expedition, and to
assemble for that "purpose such troops as
might be necessary in the neighbourhood of
Brcft. It is said from Bto 10,060 men are
to be employed. Asthere was only in Bri
tanny fufficient infantry to guard the coast,
and no cavalry or artillery, Hoche has
drawn 6000 infantry from the army of the
Sambre and Meufe, besides 2000 cavalry and
1000 artillery. '
The above is the explanation given of the
march of the troops which has caused so
much uneasiness in Paris. ~ _
Nptwithftauding the cloud in the politi
cal atmosphere of Paris, that city is yet un
disturbed. /â¢ ,
If we may believe public report, the ne
gociations at Lisle with England go on
much more rapidly than those at Montebel

tack us, unfefs they mean to cause their own
ruin. Is it that on the death of the Pope

The diffolutton of the clubs of all parties
is not the only facrifice which has been made
to the public tranquility. A reconciliation
which, after the fitting of the 24th July,
took place in the hall of the library of the
legislative body, has given hopes to the
friend? of their country.
Accounts have been received of great
disorders both in Nantz and Marseilles. The
agitators in the firft place are the royalists,
in the last the anarchists.
A partyi of French troops having entered
the territory of the little republic of Lucca,
the tree of liberty was planted, the feignieurs
put to flight, and the government instantly
demolished.
From ihe encroachments of his Frufhan
Majesty, the next step ps the Aulic council
.atVienna isexpe&cdto bean invitation to
the Emperor to execute its sentence, and
veinftate the oppressed parties in the posses
sions seized by the Pruflians. There can
be but little doubt but the emperor will un
dertake this commiffienagainft his hated rival.
Already do the Auftrians make every
preparation for openingthe campaign against
the Pruflians with success. A new corps
of 13,000 men, of the armies of the Up
per and Lower Rhine, which were cantpned'
between Franckfort and Heilburn, have
marched to' the neighbourhood of Wurf
burg; the troops encamped in the Upper
Palatine have been reinforced ; the fortref
fes of Ingolftadt, Ulm, and Wuriburg,
have been fortified in such a manner as to
hem in all the Prussian poffefiions in Fran
conia. . . ,
The Prussian cabinet, aware of its dan
ger, has marched a body of 10,000 men
from the dutchy of Magdebourg into the
circle of Fraficonia. It is said that the
celfbrated general Kalkreuth will repair to
the Tame quarter. .
Buonaparte, on the 14th of July, invit
ed his troops to make a rapid march into
France. He was much surprised that they
took the next day to debate upon this ex
pedition. He writes, that he was not able
to prevent them ;'yet he is a man who in
ceneral knows how to make himfelt obeyed,
and St is possible that they more regarded
hisintentions than his orders.
The different divisions of the army then
deliberated, arid flaming addresses came from
those of Angereau, Maffena, and Joubert,
each of them signed by from eight to ten
thousand men. . . .
It is often difficult to maintain order in
the deliberations ps moderate afTÂ«Â»m'blie.s, w.e ,
way judge of what fort were the deliberi- '
t iou s of 50,000 nun, with sabres at their 5

A letter from Infpruck of the 12th inft.
states, that according to the last accounts
from Roveredo, General Laudrm has'taken
post at Riva. Being in want of provisions, :
he requested General Buonaparte to fend
him from Italy 30,000 sacks of corn, in
stead of which, the latter transmitted to him
80,000 sacks. This circumstance affords a -
nothcr striking proof of the success of the
Negotiations, at MontebeUo, and of the"
good understanding which prevails between
two parties.
We are informed by a letter from Vienna
of 12 th inft. that a coirfiderable train of hea
vy ordinance lias been sent to the confines

pledge of their loyalty and attachment, by
declaring, that in cafe of a war breaking

LONDON, July 27.
It is not unlikely but the French, after
having equipped their Mediterranean fleet,
by the materials found in the arsenal of Ven
ice, and having effefted a jun&ion between
that and the Venetian squadron, may pro
ceed towards Cadiz, for the purpose of for
cing Lord St. Vincent to retire from the
blockade of that port, cither by direttly at
tacking our fleet, or by making a diversion
in that -quarter. ShonU this projeft suc
ceed, they would'then, \y a junftion with
the Spanish fquadron,form' an effe&ive force
of,between 50 and 60 (hips of the line.â
Our gallant officers and leamen have happi
ly convinced all Europe, that though they*
are not iu the habit of counting their eÂ»e
mies, they are able to conquer them, howe
ver superior in numbers. fhoold the plan
of the French he really such as we have
pointed out, Lord St. Vincent is doubtless
already acquainted with it, and will conse
quently take every poflible measure to pre
vent a junction between the Cadiz Tou
lan squadrons.

The letters from Holland again assert in
the usual style of bombastâthat the Dutch
fleet only"waits for a fair wind to put to sea,
and that it has nothing to fear from the En
gli(h. We are tired of reading the repeti
tion of such assertions, which ;Jre so well
known in this country to be fnlfe. We
(hall sooner cxpeft to hear of Admiral Dim
can fending some (hip 3 into the inner road
of the Texel, for the purpose of burning
their (hips.
A letter from the Italian frontiers or. the
17th ult. advises, that General Buonaparte
has threatened the Archduke of Tufcany
with marching a corps of Republican troops
into the Archduke's dominions, in cafe full
fatisfa&ion should not be given by the Tus
can government for the insults lately offered
â¢to several Frenchmen, both at Leghorn and
Pisa. ' -
August 6
At three o'clock yesterday morning an
afficer of the Circe frigate arrived at the
Admiralty Office, with an account that
the Dutch fleet had failed from the Texel on
Sunday last, An immediate communication
was made to the Office of the Duke of York
from whence dispatches were sent at eight
o'clock to Oer.eral Mufgrave, commanding
in the neighbourhood of Neweaftle; to Gen
eral Scott, commanding at Beverly, and
the Commanders of other places. The se
veral Cleicks of the admiralty were in atten
dance footi after three o'clock, and and ear
ly in the day the following letter was polled
at Lloyd's;
" Circe, Tarmouth, A.'h Sugi.jl.
" On Tuesday we* found ourfelyr s close
in with the Texel, and were much surpri
sed to find that there were not any Jhips of
force there. We spoke a fifhing-boat, and
were informed that'he enemy's squadron,
with a considerable number of' troops on
board, had failed on Sunday. Admiral
Duncan, qn the proceeding day, had weigh
ed anchor and put to sea. This is Â»all wc
could learn."
The strength of the Dutch is riot ascer
tained : it is only known that the fleet con
sists of five (hips c/f 76 and 74 guns, eight
of 66 and 64, and fix of 54 and 44, besides
frigates. The last account from the Hague
ftates,that in addition to the numerous troops
embarked on board four hundred transports,
that each 74 contained. 800 soldiers, and
smaller (hips in proportion ; but perhaps to
believe half what we heur would be to-be
lieve thrice too mifch. The fleet under ad
miral Duncan consists, if we mistake,, not, of
12 fail of the line, of which three are three
deckers, and two are of 80 guns. A much
less force, we are fatisfied, would, in the
event of an aftion, support the glory the na
tion has acquired, but it needs not an in
crease of glÂ°T > we are hlood
lefs victories. The cause of the departure
of our fleet, without which the Dutch could
not hare left the Texel, is yet to be ex
plained ; though if not a manoeuvre, it
doubtless was unavoidable.
The Circe having taken under convoy
. fcveral victuallers, with 40 axes, jo sheep,
&c. for admiral Duncan, could not go to
' the northward, where probably the 'British
fqu&dron has been driven. Should tt, in
working to its station, or in consequence of
j advice, fall in with the enemy, we predidl
the mnft important vi&ory Britain ever knew
because, we conceive the exigence of Ire
land at ifTue !âWe do not an attack on
Britain-âThe enemy might plunder a few
hamlets, when the gallant spirit of a people,
loyal, because thÂ§v are comparatively hap
py, mould "overwhelm the assailantsâBut
Ireland ! naked and famifhing ; who fees,
or thinks she fees, the cruellest of all op
pceflor* in her .kindred and absent children,
.may be expedled to seize the semblance of
relief.
On the fubjt&.-of the affaio of Ireland we
have been, uniform in our hav
ing ever spoken from fara. Tt is a painful
and ungracious office to detail unpleafantries;
bat while duty, candor and independence
demand the recital, we (hall not blush in
being the medium. Happy shall we feel
when circumstances juftify a different lan
-1 guage.
j Between eight and nine yesterday morn- -
ing, the ffrft lieutenant of the Circe arrived
at the admiralty with a confirmation of the
preceding accounts; from which time to
putting this paper to 'press, no'further in
telligence had been received.
We yesterday received the BrufTels papers
to the ill of August : they contain intelli
gence from Vienna, of the 27th, being
fotne days later than that brought by the
Hamburgh mail of Friday. Count Mi
trowfki, general of artillery, has been ap

was immediately to depart for Zara. Gene

A great part of the Hungarian mass had

vanced towards Udine. troops are

Grtat n'imbers of reoruks continued to

tered iii the Fauxbourgs.
Geoeral Moreau, it appears by letters
from Strafburg of the -3d ult. was on the
eve of returning with his army to the interi
or part of France. A rout towards Italy
was prescribed to general Defaix.
A deputation from the cantons of Zurich,
Lucern, Claris, and Schweiz, have assem
bled at St.Gall, for the purpose of adjust
ing the differences ejeifting between the
prince Abbee and his fubjefts.
Letters from Frankfort, of the 16th ult.
state the head-quarters of the archduke Char
les to have been re-established at Schweiz
ingen. The Auflrian army between the
Upper Mayne and the Danube had lately
received considerable reinforcments. A
great number of Poles, but almost destitute
of and ammunition, have assembled on
the frontiers of Moldavia. The 4th battali

Governor of Chotzym was making arrange

CAUTION.
WHEREAS a combination of men in tM*
county have undertaken to enrich thtm-,
selves.by fabricating titles tofundr/ valuable tra As
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New
Yoik, Philadelphia, London and Paris, lor which
trails of hud large fu/ns of money have been paid
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers â¢
It is therefore ju ft that public information (hould
be given, to the end, that the injured may seek re
dress while the raen have property, and are to be
found. Those who have been discovered are Tru
man Harrifon, Jofepli Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several otheri who go under fictitious names. It is
supposed that the lands offered fcr falcon those fa
bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have a&ual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No II and la, Otfego patent,
thcufand acres each, the adual property of William
Dellw)n, now of Loudon ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame pstent, thousand acres eaeh, the property of
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and James Averill
and other*, of this State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard W ells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.Â»â The Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing those iand6, as also to de
prive those men in future from imposing on indivi
dual, which their education and addiefs have en
abled them todo heretofore. Witcomb has been
a ihupkeepcr of some note in this country.
The following affidavits will set in a clear point
of. view the wicludrefs of those men,which when
the public have perused, will induec them to ex
cuse the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 18th, 17J7.
J Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
Truman HarrifoO, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to thani, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, which
was the property of William T. Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others; and further /'it said Joseph
and Truman did persuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made out on the rcth day
of November, 1793, or set back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the name of
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fictitious nam-.*,
there being no such perlon (here. To this 1 make

made applicatioSfeveral times for the fame purpo e,

that the several claims be so dated, and fupporU
ed, as to prevent the delay whioh would arise from
theyieceflity of obtaining further information, or ad

the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the
