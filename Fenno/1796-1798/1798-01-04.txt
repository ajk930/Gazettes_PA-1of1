PHILADELPHIA,
THURSDtW EVENING, JANUART 4
For the Gai:tt: of the United States.
The following ttbfcrvations are refpedful
ly submitted to the members of the State
LegiPiature as some of the re,-* ms why the
inhabit int> of this place think their requefl
for a turnpike road Germantuwn
ought to be granted.
Because at particular seasons of the year
the preftfnt road is so extremely bad as to be
totally impaflable with any kind of Carriag
es and even an Horfcback, attendtdwithfnch
danger as to put the live* of the riders in the
greatest jvo ardy.
Because all the attempts to repair them
have provedtotally ineffectual, although hea
vy taxes have been paid to support them.
Because the diftanae they arte it for, be
ing only 12 miles ; will in their opinion en
sure tbe uccefi of the undertaking, and the
constant use made of this road render the
toll moderate.
Because one half of the whole diftanee is
thickly inhabited, and forms almoll one con
tinued village for above five miie* ; the rt'itf
will ofcourfe extend to a greater number of
inhabitants than can be accomodated within
the fame diftanee on any other road leading
from the city.
Because the terms they desire it on are
such as induce them to believe it will in the
course of a few years after it is compleattd
become a free road bcfides providing a fund
for keeping it in repair forever without the
burthen of taxes. 1
In addition to ihefe reasons maÂ»y others
of cdnfiderable importance might be added,
which for brevity fake are here omitted, but
one of no small canfequence te the city and
advantage ta the country, which I -cannot
forbear urging Thp cleanliness of the ci
ty Gnce tbe awful visitations of '93 and '97
has been with great propriety urged. Tbe
removal of so large a quantity of manure and
other vegetable matler as is collected ia so
great a city at the season of the year when it
best fuitsthe Farmer to take and tbe Citizens
to part with it, certainly contributes to this
deferable endâfor want of a good road the
Farmer is frequently prevented from remov
ing it during the winterâthe spring ensues
and he is compelled to his great loss, to till
his ground withont it, while it lays ferment
ing to the great injury of the oitizens.

MR. EDITOR,
A late charge to a grand jury of Phila
delphia muff have excited the attention of
every American citizen. Since the print
ing prefTes have become the organs cf the
political parties, which unhappily divide
our country, it is of the utmost importance,
that those of both fides Ihould receive the
farhe reft 1 iAivn
The manifeft partiality, which pervades a.
part of this charge, is therefore interesting
to every citizen of the Union.
I do not mean: to alTert that any obc
principle, which the chief juftiee has therein
laid down relative to libels, is not law. Of
all that code of la*s called the common law,
which we have inherited from our English
ancestors, the law of libels is the mofl ab
fard and impracticable. To publilh a writ
ing concerning any man, which cxpofes him
to public hatred, contempt, or ridicule, is
faid to be a libel. Nay, indeed, so far has
this do&rine been carried by a late decision
in England, that such a writing of a dead
man may be libellous. Were this to be put
in force in any great extent, it would soon
work its own abolition. The historian and
satirist of the times must lay down their
pens. To immortalize the corruption of
a public magistrate, or lash the viees and
follies of any public officer, would be a
bold and hazardous attempt. That power
ful obligationâthÂ£ love of fame, or the
fear of being handed to polterity as a vil
lain, would lose all its wholesome effe&s
It is a falfe sentiment, that a man may be
di/honeft and vicious in his private life, and
â¼et be goad and virtuous in his public ca
paoity. It is impossible ia the nature of
things. The propenfityof the human mind
to vice or virtue will be the fame in all sit
uations. Is it poftible that a judge can be'
firm and independent in the feat as juftiee,
who is weak and 'servile in the direftion of
his domestic affairs ? Is it possible, that an
officer, who would not hefitat* ta cheat his
private creditors, would hesitate to cheat the
public ? The private vices of men in office
may, therefore, on many occasions with
propriety be held up to public view ; and
yet ta do this by writing, printing and pub
lishing is by lav) to be guilty of a libel. â 
The only sensible dillin&ion made by the
chief juftiee on this fttbjeft, isâ" that men
have only to take care in their publications,
that they are decent, candid, and true."â
Truth and candour are well known terms ;
but decency conveys rather an indefinite
idea. If by indecency is meant obfeenity
in a libel upon a private individual, it is
justly to be checked and punished. But if
by indecency is meant impudence in telling
bold truths of men ia office it ought to be
allowed. But this sentence of his honoris
rather a falfie gloss given to the fubjeft,
for he n>ull have known what is certainly
the law, that truth is no jollification in a
prosecution for a libel. It is well known
that a man may be punished for publilhiug
what is literally true ; and this too, for the
very reason, which his honor has laid down ;
because it will infallibly the person
libelled " to public hatred, contempt, or
ridicule which carries with it another
somewhat better reason, Which is, that it
tends immediately to a breach of the peace.
There is no getting rid of this abfttrdity,
but by making the liberty of the press con
lift in truth, and the liecntioufncfs of it in '
#
fulfeliocd ; or, what is a much fliorter lueta
<ml, by adopting the laws of ?he Turks, an J
suppressing all printing and publishing what- â 
ever. In which latter cast, it is very cer- |
tain, that there could be no libels.
Further, th? opinion of ltiÂ» honor, " that
every thrijliin&r geqlleipan ought to"se high
ly offended a' tiie parnpiilets and news-pa
pery of Philadelphia," is very exceptioaa
l,le, for two reasons Frft, that expressing
hiipfelf in thofcterms, which the French na
tion have long ago rejeCtefl,. the one as fu
perltitious, the other as feudal, 1 " his (as he
fays) ail rvuleiit (endbocy not only to fruf
trate a reconciliation, but to ereate a rup
tuit* and provoke a war between the filler
-republics." , Aud lecondlv, that this whole
paragraph of.ln's charge is a literal and
bal copy ps one in a paper o: tiff Spectator ;
arid which, therefore, may tend ilill further
to giye hi ft of displeasure to our
sri al!y. This is lure observed, not
with any intention of accufnig his honor of
grofa plagiarism, but of (hewing, that what
Sir. Addifon has remarked of the Engii(h
nation', at the time in which he wrote his
Spectators, does not apply to the state of
Pennsylvania. WhAi those periodical pub
lications took place, the Englifc nation
were the only people upon the furface of
the earth, who enjoyed even a rational (hare
of civil liberty. It is not so with Pecnfyl
vania. Other states ps the Union, it may
be ftippofed, enjoy the liberty of the piefs
in as ample a manner as that state. Aqd
who does not know that where there is one
libel puWlifhed in Philadelphia, thee are, at
lÂ«aft,-> one hundred in the city of London ?
Besides, if libels are not rtow known, nay do
not abound undei any of the governments
of Europe, particularly under that of our
" sister republic," it is only a proof, that
thofc governments are not free ; for libels
are -8 n?turally the growth of free govern
ments, as. weeds are of manure. The state
|p Pennsylvania is not, therefore, in this re
speCt, eharaCtenftifi'ally different " from all
the states a'rotffid It, 4>V from the whole civil
ized world."
But, is it not extraordinary that a judge
(hould think it his duty to call a Fritter te
account fur writing and publifhiug against a
nation, who have used every endeavour to
sap the foundations of our excellent coaftitu
tion and form of government, have foment
ed an insurreCtion in the very bosom of our
country, and have nptorioufly plundered our
citizens oftwfcnty fivemillions of Dollars,and
and that too without condefcendingto lifteu
to us upon the subjeCt IâAnd yet, that this
fame judge, when another Printer of the
fame place was "Vilifying arid 'abusing without
the least fhadffWof truth, our great and good
Washington, could fit with the most torpid
indifference ; and still continues in that state
of torpidity, while this fame Printer is still
publishing the grossest calumnities aginft the
officers and measures of our own government.
How fuch*partiality, not to fay corruption
of the worll kind, could be relilhed by the
people of A erica," is ytt to appear. It
may bejrationally supposed, that their tho'ts
â¢ on this fyVijcct will be, that the time" is al
ready come, when the teat of our federal go
vernment ought to be removed, cfpecially
from untfer the jurifdiCtien offneb a judge.
It tempts me to apply what Lord Mansfield
said of an inferior magistrate on a fimilaroc
cafion.â" it makes onebleed to think that
the administration of justice should be in such
hands,"â HORTENSIUS.

WFONESDAV JANUARY 3.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
claims, made an unfavorable report upon
the petition of Peter L3rtdais, who prayed
for an additional allowance for hi 3 services.
The report was concurred in by the houft.
Mr. Thatcher prefeWed a petition from
John Bradley and othei poftmafters
in the (late of MafFachufnts, stating that
when they rectived tfceir authority, and
gave bonds for the due performance of their
offiue, it was understood that they were
not to be accountable for the lufs of bank
notes, or other valuable papers which pair
ed through their offiees, but that a legal de
cision had lately taken place whieh had de
termined that the po.t officers were liable
for all fueh lodes ; which determination, it
was'apprehended, would fubje& them to be \
speculated upon by designing persons, who
might alledge they had sent notes, Sic. by
the psft, which ntverhad been.sent. They
pray, therefore, that when the poll office
law (hall come under consideration, a clause
may be mferted in it, declaratory of the
law in this refpeft.â Referred to the com
mittee on poft-offices and post roads.
Mr. Bayard presented another remon
(lranee from citizens of the state of Dela
ware, against changing the time for holding
the diftrift court..â Referred to the fame
committee to which the mefTage of the Pre
fideut on this fubjeft was referred.
Mr. Harper, from the committee ef way)
and means, to whom was referred a resolu
tion on the expediency of admitting licen
ces for distilling spirits to be, taken for a
week, reported it as the opinion of that
committee, that the proposition ought not
to be adopted. The report was twice read,
and referred so the fame committee of the
whoile to whom was referred the bill vela,-,
tive to the duty on spirits.
Mr. Dawfon reported a bill te provide for
â the payment of the interest of a certificate
given by the United States tÂ® general Kof
ciufko, which was twice read and commit
ted for to-morrow.
Mr. Harper, from the committee appoin
ted to consider the fuhjeA of a Bankrupt
law, was dire&ed by the committee to pre
fect the repot t which he had laid before the.
house the day before yefterdoy. It was in
the fallowing words :
" The committee to whom war referred the
following resolutionâ" Resolved, that a
committee be appointed to prepare and
report a bill for eftabliihing an uniform
fyftera of bankruptcy throughout the U
nited States," having taken the matter
into consideration, beg leave to submit
the following REPORT :
" In so complicated, and as refpels this
country, so new a fubjeft, as a system of
bankruptcy, it ir.uft be expected that many
difficulties will occur, that jnany objections
will an'le~and that"flfany doubts will be en
tertained, as to the possibility, and even as J
to thr advantage*, ef such an establishment.
Such doubts and difficulties have presented '
themselves forcibly to the committee, even
in this preliminary stage of the business ; :
but, without Undertaking ta decide how far
it may be prafticable to surmount them,
they conceive that the attempt ought to be
made. They are of opinion, that this insti
tution is greatly desired by the mercantile
part of the community, on which it is cal
culated more peculiarly to operate ; and
they can fee no reason to doubt of its bene
ficial effefts, in the support of mercantile
credit, the prevention of fraud, the restraint
of imprudent and deftrudlive speculation,
and the relief of honest industry, reduced to
distress by the viciflitudes of trade, provided
it can be adopted under such modifications
as may obviate the objections, and prevent
the abuses, whereto it is supposed to be lia
ble.
" Whether this can be accomplished, is,
in the opinion of the committee, to be as
certained only by the introduflion and full
difcuffioti of a bill, where every provision
may be brought ipto view, and all those de
tails presented by which the.benefits offuch
an institution are to be resulted, and it&w*
convfcniencies avoided. When the difficul
ties attending this measure (hall have been
fiiirly encountered, Aieuld they be found
insurmountable, the public, it is prefumcd,
having the reasons of the deciiion fully be
fore them, will acquiesce in it with more
cheerfulnefs. The states, too, in that cafe,
knowing that congress have considered the
fubjeft, and found it impracticable, on a
scale so extensive as the whole union, will
no longer be prevented, by expectations
from that quarter, from attempting local
sftabliftiments for themselves.
" The committee are therefore of opinion
that it is expedient to adopt the afore said
resolution."
The report having been read, Mr, Har
per moved that it have a feeond reading for
the purpose of being concurred with, which
motion being carried 43 to 27 ; and the
house having concurred with the report, a
committee of five members was appointed
to report a bill accordingly^
Mr. Harper from the committee of ways
and means, reported a bill for making Jeer
tain partial appropriations for the fervicc of
the ytar 1798, and for other purpose!*/
which was twice tead, and ordered to be
committed s o a committee of the whole to
d-y.
On motion, the house immediately refolv ;
ed itfelf into a committee of the whole on
this bill, Mr. Kittera in the chair; when,
the bill havitig been read,
Mr. Var.ium wilhed to be informed as to
the captures which had beeu made from the
British, within the waters of the United
States. He thought there could not be
many of this description.
Mr. Harper said, if the gentleman would
tnrn.to the letter of the Secretary of the
Treasury on this fubjeft, he would find two
awardi of til!d description had ijresdy beerr
amounting to 24,921 dollars,
r .hat others were expedted to be made, or
. iliight now be made, which would require
the remainder of the sum proposed to be
granted. Tlii number of vessels which tame
under this article he never understood to be
ttee of grear. He never heard of more than four
t upon or five. '
prayed Mr. Varnum did not feel willing to ap

n from time enough to appropriate for other award*
tmafters when they were made,

of their Subject. The vessels already awarded for

id it&wÂ» Grifwold, Gallatin, Gordon ani Brooks, oa
difficul- the ground that the duty now paid upon
ire been spirits distilled from fruft (which defcnptidn
e found of distillers this regulation was avowedly |n
efumtd, tended to accommodate) was not equal to
Fully be- that paid by distillers of grain, as the duty <
â¢h more on spirits distilled from fruit was not more
hat cafe, than 2\ cents per gallon, whilftr that on fpi-<
ered the rits dfltilled from grain paid seven cents, and
,e, on a if the amendments were agreed to, this ine

would be reduced from fix cents per gallon-,

iding for it'would increafc the temptation to fraud,
1, which as that temptation was strong or the con
and the trary, in propor.ion to the length of tims

greatly augment the duties of excise officers,

might be some inconveiiitnces experienced
by the dift'Uers of fruit, asÂ«it was not doubt

yet, as it was only jull got into operation, it Dr.
YTDuld not he right to enter into the pro- vid Jon
posed regulation, but defer it to the period the pa
when it would mod probably be necefTary which
to go into a review of the whole law. he wa *
Thf motion was supported by Messrs. Ma- and res
con, Haicrifon, Harper, J. Parker, Nicholas, Dr.
Venable, R. Williams, New, Dennis, T. beth J
Claiborne and Clay. It was asserted by Bedku
tbem, that the law as it now stood excluded ges dt
four out of five of the orchards in the sou- which
thern states from distilling their early fruit mittee
at all ; that their peaches ripened Mr.
and as hastily rotted, if nÂ»t made use of; exande
thÂ»t persons whe had only fruit to employ for tar
their stills for three or four days, sooner than to Cor
take a licence for a fortnight, fuffered their read a:
fruit to rot ; that to allow licences for a Mr.
week would produce a confutable augn.en- numbe
tation of the reverse, fir.ee those persons Count
only would' take such a licence, who, it c.ared
that privilege wer<* not allowed, would not pence
take out a licence at all, or such as has oc- dered
cafion to dia.il for a few days longer after Mr.
their fortnight licence was expired ; that it numbt
was unjust to require a man who had only a Count
small orchard, and occasion to use a dill but by dec
a few days, IWd pay a higher duty upon refern
hie Brandy than his more opulent neighbor A 1
that it was not so incoufiderable an objeft monw
as gentlemen supposed, since it tad not re- diftriL
ferenee to one licence onlyâfarmers iu the the U
fouther# states having occasion to take out lie on
separate licences for their early, their mid- Th
qie and their latter fruits ; that this regula- for m
tion would, not open a door to fraud as was bers <
f.jppofed ; that it was as undeserved impu- Senat
tation . upon the characters of persons con- they
cerned in tkis business, to suppose tbey Houl
could be tempted to defraud the revenue Tl
for the fake of half a cent per gallon upon tee o
what they could distil in a day ; that the the (
penalties consequent upou fraud, if the vir- ereÂ£V
tue of the persons concerned could not be Schu
relied upon, were fufficient to guard against; prog
them ; and that, if they were nÂ«?t, it could was j
not be expe&ed, as some gentlemen seem-
ed to suppose, that the Excise Officers
ffiould overlook the conduct of every diftill
,er ; that if they were to be so infpectcd and _ A
scourged, an attempt to defraud the revenue t'ne
could scarcely bÂ« blamed ; that except it Lag'
were the intention of gentlemen to crush Q
this domeftie manufactory, no leafonable what
objeftion could be urged against the propo- 27 tti
fition ; that the objeftions which had been t ht ]
urged proved the ignorance of gentlemen in arr j v
refpeft to this branch of business ; that t j, e <
though the excise officers would have more cerS!
trouble in ifTuing licences, it was believed Huj
they would be well fatisfied to encounter
it, since their profits we're in proportion to thin
the quantity of, spirits distilled ; that tho' t }) e
this law had been but a short time in being, one
the last season having been a scarce fruit whi
feafvn had giveaa good opportunity of try- t het
ing it ; that as the application for the a- f a ;i;
mendment waa fecouded by the whole of the | t eri
fcutbern croutitry, entoled to refp-eft,
and ougnt not,to be branded with being a mu i
f fraudulent defignupon the revenue. the
In the uouri'e of (hi 9 debate. Mr- Gallatin I
called upon gentlemen acquainted with the bu- Qn
finefs to fay what wi. the quantity of fpmts | .
which could be distilled from peaches m a week I
by a still of the capacity *f io, 40 or 50 gallens, wit
with a view to (hew that this species of spirits j fell
paid less at present than spirits distilled from j on
grain. â  . I coi
Mr. Clay answered this enquiry, by laying I cer
that a still Â«f 50 gallons would distil from five J .
to seven gallons of brandy a day- If the wea- I
ther was wet, and the peaches rotted quickly, I
not more than five ; but when the weather was tio
dry, and the peaches found, seven gallons might we
be produced. 1 we
The question on the amendment was at length I
put, and carried, 45 to 37- I , â¢
Mr. Dentns said, he withed to try another I nis
principle in this bill. The law at present re- I crc
quired an annual entry of stills, whether they bit
were ufedor not, which Â«ccafioncd persons frs- I p Q
quently tp ride io or jo miles to make the en- I
try, when they had no intentiun to make use j .
of their fliil : and not unfrequently, from not
meeting with the officer at luyne, their jour- 1
ney was taken two or three times Â«ver. In- j tic
deed, he believed, more peusltits had been in- I pu
curre'J'6ll aceount of this regulation than any j 0 p
other, and he looked upon it as ar. useless regu- I mi
latiÂ»n..-" When a mil was once entered, he tho t I
it was fufficient. and no future entry ought to I ,
be required, except when a still was about to I
be itiade use of, or when it was transferred into j
ether hands. Mr. D. propefed a feflion to this I
- effefl but after some objeitions to the intro- j u
of so important a provision into this 1
bill (which, before it could be decided upon, |
would require considerable difcuflion) by Mess.
Hartley, Gallatin and Harper, he agreed t6
withdraw it for the present.
It having been agreed to fill the blank of the ,ls
sum per gallon to be paid on the capacity of a

COMMUNICATION.
Mr. FENNELL,
" Made his firft appearalice on this stage
for three years," before as. brilliant a The
atre as ever assembled in Philadelphiaâ~the
U1 Boxes were crouded with the firft people in
tbecity, usque ad caelum. The repeated and
f ra constant applauses as the aidience, gave tef
laee timony at onc^to their taste, and the dif
tingnilhed merit of this great performer.â
K ' U ample justice was done to Dr. Young's " Re
'"vp vtnge." I have leldom seen a play better
Â° 6 cajl. It will be taken for granted that Mrs.
j Merry and Mr. Moreton were not deficient
Cre Mr. Fox played some parts of Carlos ve-
Ve- T particularly his sirs: interview with
Leonora, and gave the charafter a refpedt
con able support throughout. Zanga was all
that be ever glowed in the imagination of
been l^c oct â^ oun K never conceived the
hero of his play more perfeft, more inter
pj." efting, more awful, than he appeared in the
countenance, the deportment and the afto
nifning energy of Mr. Fennell. Many gen
avre tlemen of the most refined ansi elegant taste
this have mentioned to me, that they had no
idea of such powers of ailing, combined with
such chapty, such elocutioa, such propri
>lute ety'of gesture, voice and countenance. It
isobvious, that few charaftets lead more in
â  y n to ranting than Zanga, and therefore re
i'ate- quires the molt discriminating and chaste
wecn taste to avoid it, Mr. Fennell's bye-play
. b O . was appropriate ; his attitudes when he was
place were exceedingly interesting. We
trust that the talents ot' Mr. Fennell, will
â¢ked prove a large source of pleafttre to the pub
fecre t lie, of profit to the manages, and of honor,
p er . as well as profit to himlelf.

re Managers particularly request the con
s. I currence of the public in the abolition of a
_ cufloui, which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
r. way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at the
I Theatre.
:o 1 They are aware that gentlemen are unconfcioas
of any wrong done to the interest of the inllitu
r- tionby this practice, from a general, though rail-
I taken idea that Cheeks are the representatives of a
'> I right to so many feats in tke Theatre, during an
â ' Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will;
'â¢ when in faft, they were never intended nf more
than totem by which the Door-keepers are enabled
j to aicortain with the lead trouble to parties,thx.t
they themselves have been before in the i'heatre, or
paid for their admiflion.
|t Independent of the injury the Managers fuflain,
â such a praiSice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other difordcrly persons to surround the doors of
it the Theatre, to the oorruption of their morals and
e the great annoyance of the Audience,
y It hat also been tke source of two evils of no in
- I confultrable magnitude; one is, that fotnetinkis
I, very improper company is by these moans admit
it 1 ted ; and the other, that owity to Checks pafling
into dishonest hands, they have been frequenaly
n counterfeited to a large amount for the purpofesof
Sale.
0 This statement will, it is refpe&fully hoped, in
duce the Public to discourage such a traffic : and
j' the exertions of the Managers will, if thus aflifted,
' easily ppove adequate to its entire abolition.
