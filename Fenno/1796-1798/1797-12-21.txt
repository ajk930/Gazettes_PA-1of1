THE JManagfrs particularly request tbe con- Â£
currence of the public in the abolition of a '
cuftova, Which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
'â¢ way or cKfpofing of RETURN CHECKS at the Â°PP|
Theatre. ,n
They are aware that gentlemen are unconfeioro u' A
of any wrong done to the interest of the inllitu- R â¢"!
- tion by thispraiflicc, from a general, though mis- ' c
taken idea that Checks ai-e the reprefentatlves of a
right to so many feats in the Theatre, during an
Evening'* Entertainment, atid transferable at will;
when in faijl, they were never intended- as more 1
than hhm by which the Door-keepers are enabled
to a (certain with the It-alt trouble to ihe furtin, th ( t B.
liey ticmftlva have been before in the I'hcatre, or Ja
paid for their admission.
, Independent of the injury the Managers sustain, an
' such a praftice encourages a croud of i'dj>e boys and 3c
other difordcrly ptrfons to surround the doors of A
the Theatre, to the corruption of their moral* and O
. the great annoyance of the Audience. ~
It has also been the fouroe of two evils of no in- CI
considerable magnitude; one is, that fomctimes
, very improper company is by these means admit-
ted ; and the other, that owiu <to Checks pafling C
into dilhbneft hands, tliey have bet-n frequenaly . 1
counterfeited to a large amount for the purposes of . ' 6

This ftatenient will, it isrefpeiftfully hoped, in- lulU
dticethe Public to difcouragc such a traffic : and

DEFEAT OF the DUTCH FLEET.
1 he accounts of this important event,
of which we yesterday had our doubts
(from the circumstance of the iixdifpo
fition the Dutch had for a great length
of time shewn for leaving the Texel),
were yesterday fully confirmed by the
arrival of the Dublin Packet from Li
verpool. . ;
We were favored with an English pa
per containing an Official, and ample
detail of the action, which, from its
length we could only circulate at 3 late
hoar yesterday afternoon, (and that but
partially) in Hand Bills from our office; - :
Those of our fubferibers who may have
been difappcinted, will now be furnifhed
with the contents of our advices, at
The unfortunate ilTue of this bulinefs
to the Dutch navy, seems , in part, to jus
tify the reluctance Admiral Winter had V
shewn to fail, while a profpedt remained
of meeting the English fleet : and it
would appear in confirmation of this o
pinion, that the moment he discovered
capt. Trollope's squadron, {who had been
left by Admiral Duncan on the leok out)
he again returned toward the Texel :â-
he was to leeward of it, with this inten
tion when he was intercepted by the
timely arrival of the English Admiral.
It appears, it is true, that the Dutch
seamen behaved with great braviery ; al* "
though the contest has not been so obsti
nately maintained as in their .former en
counter with theÃritifh<Nuvy. Meeting
an enemy of equalfkill and bravery, they â¢'
had the further disadvantage of opposing
men inured, and disciplined by a long
and arduous ferviee.
The eonlequences of this victory to
the British nation are perhaps as accu
rately calculated in the following re
marks by a London Editor as any that
might be offered on the subject.
This glorious vidtory may be considered
as incalculable in its beneficial efftfts : It
will appal the Dutch, and excite [or per
haps we might fay increafej their difaffe&i- ......
' on to a system of government which fcai-- ..
ruined the political and commercial confe
queftrtbf "the Republic :â¢ It will spare us
the expence of keeping a large naval force
in the North Seas for the prot eft ton Â©F our
trade :â¢ It frees us from any apprebenfiOa ol
invasion on these kingdoms during the, en fil
ing Winter f it hasincreafed the force ofour
ancient bulwark, the navy ; and the tgft in*
mention, not the lead in importance* it Has*
enabled our gallant tars, the .faviotrrs of-their i
country, to redeenJ their charaders frofn.. 4
the disgrace which was temporarily attach- ,{'
ed to it'from the iafurreftions at- the NoreÂ».
and tends to add a new lustre to the nan*
of British feamco,. which a moment of errÂ«jv _
had covered with Ibarae. While with great
sincerity we offer a homage to Admiral Dun
can and his men, we recal to mind with ex
ultation the brilliant vidorie* of lords Howe'
Hood, Bridport, St. Vincent, and the im
portant, tho' less splendid |yccefs of Lord
Keilh, firming together a grand aggregate
indeed of* British glory. It may truly be
said, that whatever may have been the tflif- ,
carriage of our armies, or those of our al
lies by land, there never, wasaperiodin which
our navy was fÂ« universally triumphant, as
during the pfefent war. Every battle has
been a viftory, and if we have not had mÂ»re
victories, it is because we osuld not, even
by the mod cutting provocations, draw the
enemyoftenerout ofportto rneafure strength
with us.
The French Republic has received a fatal*
wound, from the blow which has struck so
deeply in the mofl tender part of her ally.
She relied en the co-operation of the Dutch
fleet, in repairing the lodes which her own
marine had fufFered, and to make an attempt
on some part of the three kingdoms. EvÂ»
ery hope of that nature has entirely van idl
ed. The French fleet at Brest, consisting of
20 fail of the line, is unprovided with sea
men ; the Spanish fleet is fhamefully bloc
ked lip in the port of Cadiz ; and the navy
of Holland will probably he foynd only in
ur harbours. England may therefore, now,
with more propriety than at any former pe
riod, be called the mistress of the sea.
There arc several letters received in

LONDON, Oftober 16.
jldmira'ty-CffiV, 03. 16, 1797* "
Captain Fairfax, of the Venerable, ar
rived early this morning with dispatches
from AdamDuncab,efq admiral of the Blue,"
ccmmander in chief of his Majesty's fliips,
&c. employed in the North Sea, to Evan
Nepean.efq. Secretary of the admiralty, Â»f
which the following are copies.
Venerable, at fca, 13th 061. 1797,
off the coast of Holland.
SIR,
BE pleased to acquaint the lords commis
sioners of the admiralty, that judging it of
â  conference their lordships fltould have as
early information as pofiible of the defeat of
.the Dutch fleet under the-command of ad-miral de I djlpatcbed the R;>fe
rotter at thrje P. M. on thei2;h (nth)
iml. with a short letter to you immediately 1
after,the a&ion was ended.
I have now further to acquiint you, for I
their lordships information, that in the,night
oftiie tothind. after I had sent away my J
letter to you of that date, I placed my
squadron in such a situation as to prevent
the enemy from returning to the Texel with- li
out my falling in with them.
At nine o'clock in the morning of the 1'
l ith I got fight of capt. Trollope's squad
ron, with signals flying for an enemy to Â£
leewarJj I immediately bore up, and made I
the signal for a general chace, and soon got x
fight of them, forming in a line on the lar- J
board tack to receive us, th* wind at N.
W. As we approached near, I made the
signal for the squadron to (horten fail, in J
order ts conned them ; soon after I Â£aw (
the land between Camperdown and Egmont,
about 9 miles to leeward of the enemy, and '
finding there was no time to be loft in mak- 1
ing the attack, I made the signal to bear
tip, break the ehemy's line, and engage '
them to leeward, each (hip her opponent '
t>y whtch I got between them and the land J
whither they were faft approaching. My 1
figtoals Were obeyed with great promptitude, 1
and Vice-admiral Onflow, in the Monarch, â 
bore down on the enemy's rear in the aioft
gallant manner, his divilion following his '
example, and the aftion commenced about '
forty minutes pad 12- o'clock.
Th'e Venerable soon got through the en- j '
emy's line, and I began a close adtion.with ! .
my division ort their van, which laded near |
two hours and a half, when I observed all i
the mails of the Dutch admiral's ship to go
by the board ; flit was, however, defended
for some time in a mod gallant mannerâ
but being over-prefied by numbers her co
lours were (truck, and admiral de Winter
was'foon brought on board the Venerable.
On looking arqund me, I observed the (hip
bearing the Vice-admiral's flag was also dif
tnafted, and had surrendered to Vice rdmi
ral Ouflorw ; and that many others hadlike
wife ft ruck. Finding we were in 9 fath
oms water, and not farther than five miles
from the land, my attention was so mueh
taken up in getting theheads of the disabled
(hips off (hore, that I was not abli to dis
tinguish the number of (hips captured ; and
the wind having been constantly on the
land (ince, we have unavoidably been much
dispersed, so that I have not been ablt to
gain an ex aft account of them, but wehave
taken pofleffion of 8 or 9 ; more of them had
(truck, bu't taking advantage of the night,
and being so near their own coast, they suc
ceeded in getting off, and some of them
â were leen going into the Texel next morn
ing r
It is with the greatest pleasure and fatis
faftion I make known to their lordships the
very gallant behaviour of Vice Admiral On
flow, the Captains, officers, seamen and ma
rines of the squadron, who all appeared act
uated vfith a truly Briti(h spirit, at least
those â¢ aat' I bad an opportunity of feeing,
One of the enemy's ships caught fire in the
pfihn", and drive very near the Venerable ;
tut- Have the ileafure to J, 'ay it <was extin
guifked, end Jhe it one of thtfhipe in our pof-.
fejfton. The fqtiadron has fnffered much in
their yÂ»ifts, yards and rigging, and many sf
them has loft a number of men, however, in no
f tV that of the enemy.
Ihe carnage on hoard the two Jhipt that
lore the AdmraVt flags hat been beyond all
dcfcript'wn ; they have had no left than 250
men killed and wounded on hoard of each ship ;
and hert /' have to lament the hfs of capt.
Btirgeft, of his Majefly't JJjip the Ardent,<who
brought that ship into a3'ton,in the mofl gallant
and miflerly manner, but <was unfortunately
killedfton after. However, the /hip continued
the aSion tlofe, till quite disabled. The public
have lofl a good and gallant officer in capt.
Btirgeft, and I, with others, afmcere friend.
Capt.Trollope's exertion and'aftive good
conduft in keeping fight of the enemy's
fleet until I cam* up, have heed truly meri
torious, and, I trust, will meet ajuft reward.
I fend this by captain Fairfax, by whose
able advice I profited much during the arc
tion, and who will give their lordships any
further particulars they may wish to know.
As mod of the ships of the squadron are
disabled, and feyeral of the prizes difmaded,
I (hall make the best. of my way with them
10 the Nora.
I herewith transmit you a lid of killed
and wounded on board such of the squa
dron as I have beet) able to coileft ; a lift
of the enemy's fleet opposed to my fquad
ton, and my line of battle on the day of
aftion. lam, Sir,

the W. N. W. and continued to do so until
Saturday morning; it then fliifted to the '
North, when I made a (ignal to w'ear, stood '
to the welbvard, and fortunately anchored '

October 15.
Yesterday, in honour of Admiral Dun- (
can's vidtory, the vessels in She river exhib- (
ited their gallant ftrcamers ; the bells of the (
different churches in and about London rang J
merrily through the day ; and late at night 1
molt of the pnneipal flreets were flluminat- 1
ed ; but it is thought, that when the offici- 1
al details are received, the illufninations will j
be general througboutthe principal towns of j
the kingdom.
Paris papers were yesterday received to
the 12th instant. There appear to be no |
official advices of hostilities having re-com
menced in Italy; but we much fear that by j
this time the horrid scene of blood is renew- ]
ed. The army of Buonaparte, from the )
statements in the official journal, is in the j
most perfect ftattf of preparation. The Au- .
ftrians on their fide, have spared no pains 1
to reiuforce their armies. Whenever the 1
campaign (hall open, therefore, the result
must be distressing to every friend of bunian- ,
ity. A curious paper has appeared in the
R cdafteur of the 6th inft. purporting to be
Utter written by lord Malmefbufy to a no
ble lord in England, and left behind "kfm at
Lisle, previous to his departure from]that ci
ty on the rupture of the negotiation, * The
letter is evidently fuppolitions, merely cal
culated to burlefqne the talents of his lord
ship as a negociator, and the progress of
the negociation which he condu&cd. We
can only look on it as an impotent attempt
to retaliate on hi* lordship for the able and
pointed manner in which, on a former 1 oc
casion he eXposed and ridiculed the empty
verbage of Charles de la Croix.
The minister it is said means to jive the
ftarap distributors in the country a regular
salary instead of 5 per cent.on what they dis
tribute: from the recent increife of (lamp du
ties, a very considerable fa < ing to the coun
try is to result from this measure.
It is a remarkable infUnee in the hiftbry of
admiral Duncan, that he has lived hifafclf to
illustrate the truth of a dorftrine which he wai
the ftrft to patronize, and to Recommend lo the
Britiflt navy. The great principle of this fyf
tera is to break the liac of the enemy,' and-ito this
lyfttm we are indebted for our most glorious
'ViÂ£tor?Â«s, frura that of the lath of April to the
Pfcfol , : Jr *
The Winifred, ââ, from Antigua, and
the Peace, - ,i, from Surinam, for Ameri
ca, have been captured by a privateer. ,
T Odtober 16. :
This morning, a little after
captain Fairfax, of his majesty's (hip, Ven
erable, arrived at the admiral ty office with
the officials of the victory gained by admi
ral Duncan over the fleet of Holland.
The two fleets were equal in numbers,
each having 16 two-decked (hips.âAdmi
ral Winter came out expressly for the pur
pose of fighting the English, by order of
the Convention. They talked of having
him tried by a court-martial if he did not
fail.
The Dutch Vice-Admiral' did not stand
the fire of the Venerable above ten minutes,
but, dropping her forefajl, (hot ahead. The
Venerable then ranged up to admiral Win
ter's (hip, when a very warmly contested
action took place which lasted above two
hours, when the Dutch were obliged to
yield to the superiority of British (kill and
courage.
At the conclusion of the aftion, the Bri
ti(h fleet found fa the ;pd(Teffion
of nine Jhips of the Line and twb frigatesâ
a Dutch brig and Schooner were funk in the
aft ion. ,
The following are the names and force of
the Dutsh (hips captured ;
Vryheid 74 Admiral De Winter
Jupiter 74 Vice-admiral Reyntjes.
Haerlcm 68
Admiral Devries 68
Gclyheid 68
Waflenaar 64
Hercules 64
Delft 56
Alcmaer , j6
Munickendam 44
Ambuscade 33
Another line of battle (hip is reported to
' be taken, name unknown.
The quarter-deck of the Dutch admiral's
' (hip was completely cleared of every man,
the admiral himfclf excepted. He escaped
without a wound. The day xfter the ac
tion the remnant of the Dutch fleet gained
the Texel, the wind having favored them
by coming round to the Weft ward. Ad
miral Winter himfelf was tflken, a* was the
Vice-Admiral's (hip, on .board 'j>{ which
were two Admirals.
Admiral Duncan yesterday anchored with
* some of his ships and prizes off Orfordnefs,
and they were sxpefted to Holfefly bay last
night. Several of his (hips are not yet ar
rived, from having the Dutch prizes to tow
home.
The killed and wounded on beard the
British fleet, as far as it has been afcertaiu
ed, isâkilled 173 âwounded 504.

N. Shields, OS. 6, '97.
My Lord, 1
For theinformation of the commander of |
any of his Majesty's ships with you, and the 1
merchants of your place, we think it eur 1
duty to acquaint you, that we just now re- 1
ceived information, by a veflel arriving this ;
morning, that (he last evening pafled a large 1
French frigate off the Tees, who had in her
company 4 ors merchant (hips which (he had 1
captured ; and we Sre sorry to add one ef 1
our armed (hips, which we suppose to be the
Sally, capt. Wolfe, as (he was cruizing off
bere, and a heavy cannonade was diftinftly
heard at Sunderland, from 6 to 10 o'clock
yesterday morning, so that we have too much
reason to fear the account trilf. The fri
gate is described as a very large one, said
to mount 36 guns atleaft.
As there is every reason to suppose her
(lay will be short on this coast, and that
Bergen is most likely to be her rendezvous
for the prizes, we trust, if there are any of
his Majesty's (hips in the Frith, there may
be a ?reat probability of intercepting them ;
it isT>ut too likely they will use the Sally
as a decoy to our merchant (hips, of which
they (hould be particularly on their guard :
(lie is a plain bark,black (ides, and her bow
sprit lying very flat, with royal pole top
gallant malts, and pole mizen top-malt, and
is a straight (heered (hip, with bulwarks.â
We remain, in great naftÂ«,
