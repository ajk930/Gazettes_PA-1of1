band goods to be " commodties particu
larly used in war : such are arns, military 1
and naval stores, timber, horfts, and even 1
:d provisions in certain junftures, where there i
nd are hopes of reducing the eitmy by fa- I
mine." The treaty between France and <
j 1 " Denmark, concluded in 1742 places tar, <
k rosin, fails, hemp, cordage, malls and tim- <
;j-_ bfcr for ship-building on the catalogue of 1
il_ contraband : and Valin in his commentary I
d on the marine ordinances of France (vol. z. <
ts page 264.) fays that "of right these arti- '
I- cles are now contraband, and have been so '
from the commencement of the prefect cen- 1
tury." In conformity with these opinions 1
has been that Of America ; and if the law >
of nations was understood by the most apt
proved jurists, (he have not erred. I
IC But the modern public law of nations, and 1
n m . odern treaties are laid to have eilablifhed a v
j different rule. If the modern public law 5
, of nations has changed thfjKiflcipte, such v
C Vchange is yet unknown to the United States v
âitis much to bo wished that more full and t.
( . fatisfa&ory information had been given in ' t
fupport of an opinion, adi fFt-rence on which n
, t is ajledged to have produced consequences ti
;I; so extremely calamitous. " ]
e it is not averred that the armed neutra- e
lity has constituted this modern public law. w
It is supposed that this cannot be averred, S
r because France will never admit the right e<
of a confederacy, whatever may be its pow- j ii
er, to impose the law on those who are not j ft
parties to it. It is supposed also, that this Ipi
cannot be averred for another reason. The ri
members of the armed Neutrality had g
. themlelves agreed upon the articles which, fc
- should be deemed contraband. Russia, the at
â¢ power originating that celebrated, though tu
; fliort lived Compact, published in the ft
principles on which /lie would maintain the m
. commerce of her fubjefts: one of these tr
â  was that the articles of contraband should ca
; 'egolated by the 10th and nth articles ch
' of her treaty of commerce with Great Bri- w
tain. - th
Afterwards, Denmark entered into a ve
convention with Russia for maintaining ge- wi
nerally the principles agreed upon, but on on
the fubjeft of contraband in particular, du
Denmark adopted as ths rule by which to
be governed, her treaty of commerce with, an
Great Britain concluded the 10th of July th
1670, in the third article of which contra- N;
band goods are described to be " ahy pro- to
'visions ofivar, as soldiers, arms, machinesi
cannon, (hipj, or other things of necefary th

ded at London on the 4th of July 1780, be- Tl
twaen Great Britain and Dehmark, to ex- ter
plain the treaty of commerce of 1670 be- fti|
tween the two powers, " Timber, foxJhip- ed
building, tar, rosin, copper in Jheets, fails, at
hemp and cordage, an.t generally rjjhatever no
serves dircXly for the equipment of a vefel, un- by
wrought iron and fir planks excepted," are wi
declared to be contraband. Ut
Denmark having in her Convention with to
Russia adopted her treaty with England, wh
made in 1670, as declaratory of those arti- bo
cles which ftie would consider as contra- the
band, and having by her explanatory agree- do]
ment with England-fabftitijted a particular cot
enumeration of Articles for a general def- 1
cription of them, no: as an amendment, but tio
as an explanation of the treaty of 1670 has anc
taken a different rule,, in the very .compadt tali
referred to as eftabliihing a modern public it
law of nations, from that taken bv Ruflia. rig
The rule ofDcnmark clafies among contra- mil
band predfely the lame articles which are of
enumerated as such in the treaty between Frs
the United States and Britain, and which tru
are enly found in that enumeration, bet.iufe Sta

- j justice, and their own peculiar fuuation,
t j fo.k id a resort to these means for any other
i purpose thati the defence of their own

t gagements. It was not a cafe in which
i force would have been deemed juftiable ;
: and the objeft, being unattainable bf mu
i tual consent, was unavoidably relinquished
: f6r the moment. Yet it was proper to enu
â¢ merate the articles which were before con
: traband, and which continued to be so, be
cause that enumeration notified to the mer
chants of the United States the hazard
which their commodies wonld encounter on
the seas, and because also it prevents thofs
vexatious altercations which might other
wise have been produced by the efforts of
one party to swell, and of the other to re
duce the lift.
Jf on the refufal of Britain to substitute
any other rule concerning contraband, in
the of that established by the Law of
Nations, France finds herfelf in a fuuation
to be injured by an observance of her en
gagements with the United States, it is not
thi. treaty with Britain, but that with
France which has produced this situation.
This was forefeen when that treaty was en
tered into, and did not prevent it. The
stipulation concerning contraband was form
ed when France was at peace and America
at War; although that state of things did
not long continue, yet its continuance was
by no means deemed im/iollible. Not
withstanding this, the Government of the
United States has manifefted a willingncfs
to change this stipulation as well as that
which refpefts enemies property in neutral
bottoms, so faon as France complained of*
them: of this the'letter*from Mr. Ran-'
dolp to Mr. Adet already quoted afford*
conclusive testimony.
ft appears then on examining this objec
tion to the treaty between the United States
and Britain, that it has not added to the ca
talogue of contraband a single article; that
it has ceded no pnvibge, has granted r'o
.right, and that it has not changed inthernoft
minutecircorriftance the pre-exiftingfu^ a:ion
of the Uuited States in relation either to
France or to Britain. Notwithstanding theft

Incapable of duplicity, America, with the i
pride of conscious integrity, repels this infinua- 1
tion, and courts an investigation of the fails on
which, it is founded.
The government of the United States and that
of Britain, having conftrucd the law of nations
differently in this re!pe<S, each would have afl
ed upon its own opinion of that law : the pri
vateer* of England would have seized as contra
band any goods deemed fueh in their courts of
admiralty ; and the government of the.Urtited
States would hav; reclaimed such goods, and
would have supported the demand in such a man
ner as its own judgment diilated. This pro
cedure is not changed. The right to make such
reclamations has not been relinquiftied, nor has
the legality of the seizure in any other cafe than
that of an attempt to enter a place actually in
verted, been m any degree admitted.
It is true, that the British government renew
ed the order concerning provisions about the time
of the ratification of this treaty; but it is not
less true, that the government of the United
State= niamfefled a farm resolution to submit to
no filch conflruflion, and remonstrated Jo feri
oufly againfl i' as to produce a revocation of the
order. Nor is this all: claims for proiifions

price of the commodity seized, butwere regu
hted by its price at the port of destination, and
eonfequently the atfual as Well as avowed prin
ciple of such aerifions was, that the goods seiz
ed had not become contraband " according to
the existing law of rations." t
The intention of the govefrtment then, and
the prailice under the article, are in direfl op
pofitio* to these injurious suspicions, the indul

Paliiag AVer this extraordinary language, the (
' undtrlifried,'Rririg oely of producing -
" accammddation by the exhibition ps truth, will
cpnQder the opinion which is obliquely hinted, '
' and the fadi' which is direillly averred.
The praiftice of forming commercial treaties i
1 is so universal among other nations, having any '
commercial intercosrfe with each other, that it ,
â¢ seems unnecefiary (o discuss their utility. The ]
right to form those treaties has been so univer
' sally asserted and admitted, that it seems to be '
" the infepsrable attribute of sovereignty, to be
c queflioncd only by those who question the right
' of i nation to covern itfelf, and to be ceded 1
' only by those who are prepared to cede their in- i
dependence.
But the prosperity of the United States (
" is, in a peculiar degree, promoted by ex
-0 ternal commerce. A people almost exclu
sively agricultural have not within them
e selves a market for the surplus produce of
their labor, or a fufficient number and va
n riety of articles ps exchange to supply the
wants of the cultivation t they cannot have
IS an internal, which tvill compensate for the
.. loss of an external commerce : they mufl
i- feafch abroad for manufactures, fmr many
l- other articles which contribute to the com
'f fort aiid. ccuvetiietic{ of life, and they mufl
fearch abroad also for a market so* that
ri _ large portion of. the produftions of their
foil, which cannot be confnmed at home,
The policy of a nation thus circumstanced,
as must ever be to encourage external com
in merce, and to open to itfelf every possible
n " market for the disposition of its fuperflui
ties, and tlie supply of its wants. The
j, e commercial and manu'facluring charafter and
ot capacities of England must turn into that
qd channel a considerable portion of the com
to merce of any nation under the circumftan-'
ri ces of the United States. It is a market
too important and too.valuable to be volun
tarily closed ; in confequencc a confidera
al_ be portion of their commerce has taken
â¢it. that direction, and a continual solicitude
ci- has been manifefted to regu'ate and feeure
ms it by contrast. Toabolilh this eommerce,
h e or to refufe to give it permanence and secu
rity by fair and equal ftipulattons would be
m a facrifice which no nation ought to require,
\ x _ ard which no nation ought to make. In
to forming her treaty of amity and commerce
with the' United States, France claimed no
"d futh prerogative. Thai treaty declares the
intention .of the parties to be, " to fix in
ej T an equitable and permanent manner the rules
pn which ought to be followed relative to the
jfo. correspondence and commerce, which the

F ing a commercial treaty with Britain the te- ly
fore, in which no peculiar privilege is gr â¢ ' 1

" believed itfelf to be trÂ»nfaÂ«aio& Â» ,h,
' exchifively its own, which could give u*i- |ie
. brage to none, and which, no other nation co

r! fequenily no motive for concealing trom as
' France, or any other power, that the. ne- er
1 : gociation of Mr. Jay might or might not th
J terminate in a commercial treaty. Ihe de- cc
j claration therefoie was not made ; nor is it a\
- usual for nations about to enter into ilegoci
s ations, to proclaim to others the farifus t
> I obiefts to which those negociitiois may
I possibly be direfled. Such is not, oor has tf
fj it ever been the pra&ice of France. 10 ,rt
â ! suppose a necefiity or a duty Â°V l h e
o ! one government thus to proclaim all its a
:s | views, or to eonfult an other with relpeft to ct
e its arrangement of its own affairs, is to im- S
ply a dependence to which no government
ought willingly to fubreit. So far as the tl
iiltâ¬reftsof France might be involved in the o
_ ncgociation, the inftruftions given to the e'
â¢- negociator were promptly cotnmuricated. P
e The minister of this republic was informed g
d officially that Mr. Jay was inftuufhil not to a
7 weaken the engagements of the United ti
States to France. Further information was d
j neither to have been required or espe&ed : o
ie indeed that which was given I urnifhed rea- f
:- son to suppose that one of tlie otjefts of v
f- the liegociation with Great Britain was a >
e commercial treaty. Why than such unne- 1-
c ceffary and unmerited farcafcns against a â¢-
e cautious arid unoffending ally ? Those ob- 0
>( j jests which (he pursued were such as an in- t
,y dependent nation might legitimately pursue, *
1- and such as America never had dissembles!,
> and never deemed it neceffari: to dissemble
Y her vvifh to obtain. Why Should an effort
a s be made to impfefs France w;ith an opinion,
5 0 that Mr. Jay was not authoi ifed to nego
ciate a conmercial treaty wit'li Britain,when
tr the fixed opinion of America had ever been
m that Franc: could not be arid ought not to a
t0 be diffatisfed with the formation of such a t
: .p treaty ? Why should the minister of France \
have been informed officially that Mr. Jay t
0 f was especially inftrufled not to weaken the t
to engagements of the United States to s
ve France, if it was intended to convince that J
ld minister that bis powers did not extend to '
fubjefls in any degree connefted with those ]
engagements ? To what purpose should the <
. government of the United States have prac- 1
â¢j ticed a deception deemed by itfelf totally ]
id unnecessary, and which its utmost efforts i
could not long continue ? Tt requires an e- ;
le qual degree of folly and vide to pra&icp an 1

diately be dftefted, and the deteflion of 1
which must eipofe its author to general in
es famy, as well as the enmity of those on '
iy whom the frapd had been pradtifed. These
it confiderationa ought to have produced some
le hesitation concerning the fait. The tefti-
mony in support of it ought to have been 1
3e very positive ind very unexceptionable be
lit fore it received implicit faith. It should
:d have been very clear that there was no mis- 1
n- take, no misunderstanding concerning the 1
information communicated, before the 1
es charge was made in such terms as the rain
x" ifter of France has been pleased to employ ;
u " but the testimony is believed to be fatisfac
n" tory, that the government of 'the United
0 States has not endeavored to impress in
a " France any opinion on this fubjeft which
ie the faÂ£l of the ease (lid not warrant. The
declaration of Mr. Randolph, made July
kf Bth, 1795, is full on this point. It is in
these words : " I never could with truth
â y have informed the French minister, that the

sage to the senate, contemplated only an
'V adjustment of our complaints ; if by this
elr phrase it be intended to exclude commer-

for faying so, since the French republic

* taining some remarks on James Jones, Esq.

t hoi ft Livingfton. A fracas took place on t
a Tuesday evening, on the battery, between {
e Mr. Jones, and Mr. Livingfton ; in confe
e quence thereof, those gentlemen we are in
- formed, met yesterday afternoon at Hoboec

MR. FENNO,
We hear the vile incendiary Bache, in company
on WedntfHay with Dr, Leib, was disseminating
his political poison among the citizens of the Nor
thern Liberties, and announced his intention of
having a Jacobinical feftival at she Falls of Schuyl
kill on Saturday, where he intended to defennt up
on the answer of the President to tht address of
the Youth of this cityâYou may therefore expeft
to fee a long Ifll of hellifli toasts, drank on the oc
casion, on Monday next, infected in his fhamelcfs
Aurora.
mr* rtvuo,
Bache, whilst other people were observing tht
Fad Day,* yesterday (except a few Jacobins) ai ev
ery good man ought to do, was circulating his ve
hicle o( feditlbn and lies, hiÂ« newfpsper. He un
dertakes to make i flatement of the poll at the
late Southwark ekiftion : his return I believe is not
corrcdt as to numbers; and as to the political sen
timents of some of the candidates, itis falfe ;
for Mr- Pierce, Mr. Hutton, and Mr. Shed
arc well known to he Federaliflsâlf such ara anti
, republican, J know sot what he means by repabli
ean. Io his this morning's paper, he brags of the
Southwark and New York elections, as (hewing the
sentiments of the people at this time: as to the
Ssuth wark police election the Federalists thought it
fp unimportant who were elected commiflicners,
that scarcely any of them attended the ele&ion,
and those merely to Clew that there was an opposi
tion to /mm of their ticket, whilst the Jacobins had [
forty or fifty of their creatures circulating their |
ticket, with thuir usual knavilli schemesâThey j
were indnftrious indeed, when there was little or â 
mopfofiicn, well remembering the defeat theyfuf
fered at Israel's cleition.
Anotherjreafon, Mr. Fenno, I mufl give yon
The supporters of government knew that Mr Shed,
Mr. Hutton (who tun aifa in the federal ticket)
and Mr. Pierce, were Federalifis. Had the gov
ernment fide thought it worth while to contefl the
election, they no doubt could have fuccceded â
witness their fuccefs,in the choice of a Federal
Conftahle (in opposition to a violent Jacobin) al
though the faflion had been > t work for a month
lefore. So much for Southwark As to the
New York eleition, I hav# little vo fay 1 the returns
of that (ele&ion) are not to be published before
the end of this month. I know not haw Ben can
lie by antitipatiÂ«n ; he knows not that Livingfton
has got his ele&ion, or if so, by more than a majo
rity of one vote. He thinks no doubt it. is bed
tarhira to keep up his trade, and bettÂ«r to tell lies
'time, than to be deprived of tellinj them at all,;
whichl thmk is morally impoflible for him to do,
if he holds (as he mnji do Jto his friend Dr. Frieft

Bache's Bordetto<wn Communication.
M* tenno, s . '
Aslhave always, deemed itunneceflary to con-*
tradidt any fafl ttated in Cache's paper, I (hould
have taken no notice of the Ctmmunication in
that paper from Bordentown, if I had not been
informed it has been taken up by some New-
York papers. This Bordentown communica
tion is a plain, flat, democrat c falfhood. It is
certain it came from one of three men in that
village, all of whom arc the devoted disciples
of Tom Paine irv religion, morals and politics,
it is not therefore furprifmg that the truth is not
in them. You may be allured that we fliall en
deavor to trace this communication to its author,
and expose him as he ought to be. In the ad
dress to Corigret's that went from PUrlington
county, above one hundred signers were procur
ed from this place and its vicinity.

Bache ia his paper of this morning fays,
"it was early foretold that the insidious re
commendation of a British Printer to "the
Youth of this city, to wear a cockade would
be attended with disagreeable consequences.
The prediftionhaa been in a degree verified ;
tumultuous meetings .and riots took place
towards dark but.they were fortunately not
attended with any lerious consequences."
No misrepresentation in too grofsfor Bache,
ordoes he mean that it was by the recom
mendation of the Bnti(h printer a number
of people with Freneh cockades in their
hati met in a twisultucitf and riotoÂ»s maa
uer in tke State-House Yard âWill he be
so good as to tell in a'fo, by whose recom
mendation the magistracy interfered and sent
the most difordetfyof the cockade gentry
to prisonâa number of people with Frehch
cockades in their hats ftrefcts, on
the fall-day, go to the place in â¢
the Cityâ.inf.ilt those who have profeffed
their devotion to their country's cause and
behave in so disorderly a manrterthat the ma
gistrates are obliged ty interfere to suppress
them. Bache with his usual effr6ntery as
cribes to the Badge which distinguishes A
mericans th* tumult of Wednesday evening,
when he well knows that what tnok plaue
was begun by the persOns wearing French
cockades, and ended by themagiftritea fend
ing to prison as many of thofc pei'k.ts as
did not escape either by flight or taking the
cockades out tif their hitsâas this was the
badge (the'badge oFa nation who have been
plundering and iufufting a* Â£or a long time
by whifcfitliey thought proper to dis
tinguish themselves. iiache carinothavc the
credit of meaning this badge when he fays,
"the scenes of yesterday (hoifld be a warn
ing and teach our citizens to difeard a badge
I which can only tend to markdivifions among
us and increase the heat of party spirit f
Yet with refpe& to their badge he would
have been Blent.âNo, he means that we
should difeard the badge that dittinguifties
Americans from the enemies of America, i
Brit why difeard this badge ? Can there be
a divilion offentiment upon the pro'priety of ;
rsfolving to defend otirfclves ? If there be, :
then itis efiential that this division be known \
prevloufly and that true Americans be dif- j
tinguifhed from the partizans of France ;
but lam persuaded that so small is the num- '
ber ofthefe people and such their impotence
that it cannot be justly said there is is a di- \
vision among usâhow weak they are was I
. so fully demonstrated on Wednesday that no i
furthsr attempts of the kind are to be ap 5
prehended. This is the last effort of the i
boasted diplomatic jkill of the French Di. j
re&ory here, and so clumsy a piece of bijfi- >
ness have their principal agents made of it !
thatiin all probability they will not be
worthy of their hire. Bache disseminates
the atheistical principles of Paineâpublifh
es forged letters of. general Wafliington
accuses him of aflaflinatienâaccnfes the
Secretary of State taking a bribe
âblushes not when his filfchoods are
detested and exposed endeavours to ridi
cule the age of our Pre'fident. This fame
Bache dares to take within his polluted lips
the awful name of God, of that God whose
holy religion he has endeavoured tefubvert;
he has the front to talk of the good of his
country whose peace and happiness he has
labored to destroy. He has founded the low
est depths of human depravity,and now exhi
bits to the world an example of wickedness
that no man of hiÂ£ years crcr arrived at be

SIR.
THE inhabitants of the town of Newbu
ryport, fully impressed with the present im
portant crisis of public affairs,.mre prompted
no less by a feufe of duty thauby their own
feelings, to express those sentiments which
the occafi'on so naturally itlfpires in the bead
of every American. From the long experi
ence of your conduft |tn' the many public
offices to which you have been called by
your own country, they feel the most per
feft confidence in your wisdom, integrity
and patriotum ; and they with cheerfulnefs
declare their entire approbation of your at
tempt to adjust all existing disputes with
the French Republic by an amicable nego
ciation ; of that spirit of conoiliation whioh
di&3tedyour inftruftions to our ministers ;
and'of the principle* of justice on which
they were founded. They learn with equal \
indignation and astonishment that this spirit
of conciliation has been repelled with com
tempt, that these principles of justice have
been disregarded, and that a heavy tribute,
vyith humiliating concessions on our part,
have been proposed to us in a manner arbi
trary and unfriendly, as the price at which
we must purchase the right of being heard.
The inhabitants of this town duly appre
ciate the blessings of peace and neutrality,
but they will never complain at the' loss of
those bleflings when conflrained to facrifice
them to honor, the dignity and the essential
interests of their country. They consider
the present interesting state of public affairs
as a solemn appeal to the hearts of all inde
pendent Americans, and a call on them to
come forward with unanimity and firmnefs,
in support of the government and the men
of their choiceâto refill with becoming
dignity any vain attempt to derogate fiom
our common fovercignty, or to degrade our
national charafter frÂ«m the rank it now jufl-
Iy holds among nation* âto conÂ»ince tlie
world that' we are alike uninfluenced by
corruption and by fearâand that we will
not be it d.fWdrd people, the miserable (laves
of a foreign power, or the drfpicable tools
of foreign influence.
ImpreflTcd with these fentimtfflts, and re
lying wftk full confidence Â«n the wisdom
and patriolifm of every branch of - govern

pleJge their lives atld fortunes to support

to a;i
"?t)e bill directing payment to a detachment
â¢'of raifvtia foHfcrvices performed in the year
1 79}, lyider'Major James Ore, was read the
third time and puffed.
The amendments of the Senate to the bill
empo-.vcring certain officers and others to ad
minister oaths, were taken up and agreed to.
Mr. That'chfr, from the committee on
the subject of Poff Office and Pots Roads, re
ported that the committee did aot consider it
expedient to make any alteration at present
in rlie art palled in the last winter felTion, 'ef
rabTithijig Post Offices afwl Post Road*. Re

Mr. Bui.lock prs(Vn**Â«t petitions

and TqMjnton, in YfafTacliufe'ttsv again# the
srmina of merehants'-v&fTels, and general!/
again/tahy ineafures whicfh might lead to wiir.
They had the famecourfe with other prfJfidns
of the like natirre. " â¢
On motion of Mr. Otis, the honfe went
into a committee of the whole on the bill sup -
plemerttary, and in aiddftioit to an ait for the
rellgf of persons imprisoned for "debt"; and
after some discussion, and several amendments
made, the committee rose, was difeharged
from a farther confrderation of the lubjeit,
and the bill was recommitted.
Mr. Rutledg b called for the reading of
the bill from the Senate to authorize the Pre
ftderttof the United States to cause to be pur
chaied or built a number of small veflels, to
beequtpped as gallies, or otherwise. It was
read, and rtferred to the committee-os the
whole on the state of the union. The number
of velfels is riot to exceed ten, and the money
to be appropriated not to exceed 80,000 I
dollars.
Mr. Imlay present-ed certain resolutions
agreed upon at a public meeting at Monmouth
in New-Jerfeyy< approbatory of the meaftires
of the Executive, and exprsliive of determi
nations to support all the afts of tlte Govern
ment. Referred as uAial.
A bill was received from the Senate for the
relief &f Joseph Nourfe, and read the firft
time.
On motion of Ml. LiviNGSTOÂ»i thehoufe
went into a coniiraittee.pf the whole on the
report of the committee <sf,claims on the pe
titions of Alexander Macoinb and Wjlliam
Edgar. These petitioners, it appears/ were
purehafirrs of certain lands in the North-west
ern Territory, fold at New-York in 1787,
under the of Congress ofnthe 20th of
May, 17854 Tl>e tnerhorialifts having ne
gleiited to pay the instalments according to
the terms of the Conflitutioa,' the firft pay
ment whicli they made became forfeited.â
They request that Congress will eitherpermit
them now to accomplish the payment us the
purchase money on the original terms, and
thus obtain a grant of the whaleiquautity of
land purchased, ora provision by law tj grant
to them so mueh of the said land as will be in
thepropofition which the sum heretofore paid
bears to the whole amount of the purchase
money. Several of the lots for which these
persons made their contract having been fold
at Pittsburgh, in pursuance of the art of the
18th sf May, 1796, the committee states,
that if the prayer o,f the petition should be
granted, it will be necefiary to indemnify the
p s chafers by granting other lots of equivalent
value. But as the petitioners have fliewn no
reason why they did not fulfil their contract,
excepting that their funds were otherwise
employed, and as the United States muff have
incurred considerable expences in Hie negocia
tion when the contract was firlt made, the
committee of claims can find ni reason why
the forfeiture to which the .petitioners have
fubjecti-d themftlves Dy the terms of titeircon
trait, should be remitted ; they therefore re
port itas their opinion ;' tfjat the prayer oi the
petition ought not to be granted-' The whole
purchase money was 88,764 dollars; one third,
viz. 19,669 dollars-had been paid and by the
contract forfeited.
This report was advocated by Meflrs. D.
Foster, Bayard, Macon, and Allen;
and opposed by Meflrs. I.i yingston, and
Harper. It was agreed to, there being 5;
votes in its favour. The house concurred.
On motion of Mr. Harper, "the house
went into a committee of the whole on'the re
port of the committee of claims on the peti
tion of Captain Thomas Lewis. The petiti
oner prays for extra pay as an Aid-du-Camp
to General Wayne, for a certain, time. The
committee report.that the General had alrea
dy two Aids (which was ail he was entitled
to) and that it was a fettled principle with re
fpeitt to the army, not to pay an officer in two
capacities. As it appeared by the discussion,
rkat Captain Lewis had been employed by
General 'Vayne as an additional Aid, and
that th. it .nciple spoken of by the committee
at claims iiad heretofore been departed from,
the report of the committee was disagreed to,
and k resolution directing the Accounting
Officers to fettle his account, was agreed to.
The house concurred in the repor* and a bill
was direited to be brought injiccordingly.
Mr. Sewall movedthat the committee of
the whole en the date of the "Union "be dif
eharged from the further consideration of the
bill authorizing the President of the United
States to raise a Provisional Army, in order
that it might be referred to a feleÂ£t committee.
Agreed, >( and
On motion of Mr. Sitgreaves, it was re
ferred to the committee for the protection of
commerce and the defence of the country.
Mr. Sewall said, as Mr. Livingston,
who was a member of the committee just
named, had obtained leave of absence for the
remainder of the fefliOn, it would be necellary
to add a member to that committee in his
place.
Agreed, and Mr. Brooks was added.
Mr. Davis moved to meet in future at ten
o'clock, instead of eleven in the morning.â
The motion was loft, only 21 tor it.
