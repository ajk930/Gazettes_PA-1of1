DEBATE -TAKING.
Wednesday, March ai.
The House being in a cpmnutteeof Â»he wnol
on the report ofa falect commit tee on

the btanding Rules, and a provrtmn being

M H Â°R e NICHOLAS moved that the coin
inifee fhoÂ«M rife. He hopedl this fub
ieÂ£t wouiir net be ;*ted upon at prefen..
believed his colleague (Mr.
brought it forward, had waved the caM.ng ot
,t v.pf from an idea that the d.fcuffion of it
miKht i roduce some personal irritation. He
hoped, therefore, it would be
4 he public business which was before the
House wasdifpofed of._ _ '
â¢Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) d.dnota
w hat the gentleman meant by persona rrua
tion He hoped he would explain h.mklt.
Mr. Nicholas replied, that the g e "^"
man from Naw-Jerfey molt recolert the â¢ -
Mil. v.hith be ex pre lied h.mlelf
proportion was brought forward. Hertqtt
red ir t lÂ»e cv dll Uted, and made a decla
ration which (hewed that he h.mleU
rd his conduct as with it. When
the importance of a faithful report of the
proceedings of that House Â«?s c oiiMered, U
mult be allowed that it was of cotifequence
rl It iÂ» itono amending for the purpose ot ta
kin" flutes fluaid be as independent atpotii
blsr If, however, no
his o, n feelings as concerned he fl,Â« d have
no iifpofifiod to wave the fubje-t, but as ti
did not expetf It would have been entered
upon to-day, he hoped the committee would
rife, and let it be taken up at an early period.
Mr Allen hoped the committee would
not ric, until some information was given as
to the method of doing this buimefs. It waÂ»
understood by the people abroad that the dÂ«-
bares were pubhlhed by the clerk of t,
House, and authorised by the House. He
wished' the fpbU might be undeceived on
this point. He .had seen prions in the Htmle
*hÂ«WpÂ»ared to ike down the proceedings; ,
but he w lifted tq know how they came there. (
He thought the public had been abided by ac
raunts of debates Â« hicji had been pubhlhed, ;
and lie >â  ifhed the clerk to be exonerated from (
any blame in the business. ;
Mr D iwsON hoped the committee would [
rife for the reaions which had been mention- .
cd.' When he firlt offeied this resolution to (
the House, he declared he had no particular (
vcrftlii fn view. He thoffght it founded on {
propriety tUftl found reafou, ahd therefore he (
prupofci i'- , i j I
Mr. Go K.D9N hoped the committee would (
i, >r rite. He was himfelf ready to vote upon ]
the qutliiot;. He did not wiflb by any means (
to.' iVe the fan WSni <3 the House to any de- .
b Ifcs wh'Kh upglit.be p.ibjifhed. He did not (
tiiink'the queflou of that importance which
tiie gentleman irom Virginia feemcji to attach i
Â° Mr. Day ton hoped that a decision might '
be had wtliout. delay, efpeciaily as the
gentleman* from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas)
had given the. bufinels a turn and direc- (
tion which the mover of the proportion
himfelf had difavoWed. He knev/that the
proposition would prod it re this but he
did not suppose any gentleman would have a
vov.-e.i, on'rhis floor, that this question was
to bs tonivcited with a late deciiion of the
Speaker. It gentlemen intended this, tfhy
did tbev not do it in an opâ¬U, cAndid, and
man)v manner, by an appeal from the decision
of the chair'at the time. If the motion was
intended toreijillate a man upon the floorwhom
the Speaker had discharged from it, he wiihed
it bow to be decided, and not to lie till the
end of the fefiion, to be called up or not, at
the will ot ths mover, in order to have it al
cerrained whether the Speaker had acled pro
perly or othcrwifc.
Mr. Brooks saw no reason why the com
mittee ftidtild rift. The gentlemar.from Vir
ginia said the fpbjeft was important; if io, it
ouglit now to be decided upon.
Mr, Nicholas thougMt what he had said
have fatisfied the gentleman from New
Jersey, as to his intentions. As he did not
bring forward the motion, he could not be
justly charged with any dellgn in the bufir
ness. It mull be evident to every one that
tha gentletiisn himlelfconnected this question
with a decifion. He wiflied it was not so
Connected. He thought the regulation pro
â¢ poled abfo'utcly neceifary, in order to secure
a jull a.i i'ia r report of their proceedings. He
(hould have no objeÂ£tion to rake up tlie bufi
r.cls to-morrow ; but if the queltion for the
committee to rifÂ» was losl I ,' he thould then
make'fonie obfervarioni upÂ«n the fubjeit. Â«
Mr. M'DoweLl hoped the commitree
woivld'nfe. It was of importance that tfie
debate:, ihould be taken accurately and fully,
apd he wirtied it to be ascertained whether a
member had a right to introduce a person on
the floor of the House, or whether the Spea
ker only could do it.
Mr. Harper wasin favour of the commit
tee's riling not because he thought the ques
tion important, but because he thought it un
important; and if the committee rose he (hould
move to postpone the further consideration of
it to a d.(Lilit day ; for however unimportant
be thought it, he perceived other gentlemen
thought differently, and he fuppolcd intend
.ed to introduce a long debate upon it, and
this he wiihed to avoid, in order to proceed
with the business of the public.
The question for riling was put and carried,
â¦4 to 36.
The committee rose accordingly, and on
leave being alked for the committee to fit a
gain,
Mr. Ha*PÂ£* hoped leave would not be
granted, as he wiihed a-poftponement of the
ronlidcration to take place.
Mr. Otis hoped leave would not be given
to fit again upon this business. He did not
know that any inconveniencies had been point
ed out as arising from the prcfent mode of ma
naging the business. All thole who wished
to coiiieon to the Boor of the Hi Â»e to take
the debates, had been permitted,*Â«-xcept in
some fpccial cases. If this was the general
practice, where could be the nccetfity for this
rule I it any particular cafe of complair.tex
ii'.cd, they ought to conlidcr it by itfelf, and
not adopt a general rule which might never
again apply. ordpr h> provide for it. There
was r.o way ofavi, ding perf'onality in thisbu
-1 l-nefs. It would always be a quetlion between
tiie individual who had been rejected and the
Knulif. Kor if the House adopted a gencrÂ»!
rule, and persons admitted behaved air.ifs, it
â¢vould Hi'l be a queltion whether the Speaker
l'.id not the power to crder them away. This
Â»i ::yiUjr..tionj therefore, would produce 110
e.Teft. excÂ«pt gentlemen wished to bring Â«P
cv.ry fubjed wh ch could irritate the minds
~f members, .and thereby prevent the public
bunÂ«efÂ» from being done. _ I
Mr. NiCHOt-AS belusved it was
impoflible fur the gentleman trom Malta
cl hi felts to make a fjcech without lomein 1- ,
nuatiuns as to the motives ot others. It it n
-ver been polfible for him to have dÂ»ne so, nc .
mi lit have done it on tlte preient occalion,
when it had been wished to defer the conltde-
P ration, in order to avoid irritation. He would
" tell the gentleman what he wished to be doUe.
s It was not to ascertain whether the Speaker
g had done his duty heretofore, but whether the
" power of discharging short-hand writers from
3 the House should be veiled in the Speaker.â
' Willi refiiect to the reports which were given
L of thert debates, he supposed gentlemen were
not ajways fatisfied with them, but they we t e
nevcAtelefs Valuable information to the pub
lic ; and"if it wasMinportaht that this informa
tjon iholild he publifhcd, it was to bs consi
dered ifciictjier the persons who attended the
House to take notes should depeiiil- upon the
w ill of the' Speaker, or upon a majority of the
House forthe privilege. [l he splaki r did
not think this difc'u(lton proper whilst he was
in the chair.] Mr. N. said lie did not wish to
enter into ihe difculTion. It it was the delire
of the gentleman from a. Carolina to poll pone
the consideration for a few weeks, he (hould
agree to it; but he hoped the bulmefs would
noNbe g<;t rid of without dilcullion in a com
mittee of the whole, when the Speaker, who
felt himfelf interelled in it, might have an
opportunity of speaking' to the question.
Mr. Rutlklicsk said, ii any thing had
taken place which, in the opinion of the gen
tleman from Virginia, made it nece'iary to
att upon the 6uiinefs of Stenographers, it
would be welf for him to lay a resolution Up
on the table upon which the house might aet.
If there were nothing which made it necefla
ry, it would be uowife to act upon it. Ihe
gentleman spoke. aj it there was no Stenogra
pher in the house. . When the people law
this, they would naturaliy ask, to whom then
are wc indebted forthe debates which we
daily read ? Why, said Mr. R. is this fub
jed introduced I It was generally believed
that this re io 111 lion had reference to a particu
lar act, which octiireria few days previous to
its being brought forward. But the mover
declares he had not that transaction in view.
If tJ>fewaSlhÂ«cafe> if there was no complaint
against the arbitrary conduct of tlie Speaker,
and every day's debate appears faithfully Ex
ported in the papers, what necellity was there,
he asked, for this provilion ? if the gentle
man from Virginia milled a lavorde Stenogra
pher, and wiihed to fee him remttaied, it ;
would be well to bring forward a resolution j
to that effett. But, (aid he, whilst I fee a
Stenographer taking down the words I am I
now speaking, and when I find our proceed- >
ings regularly laid before the public, 1 can '<
fee 110 necellity for any general regulation 011
the (Ã¼bjeel. But it was said, that it was ne
cellary to be determined whether the Speaker 1
should have the power of driving Stenogra
phers from the house. If there be any cir- '
citmftance which renders this determination
neceUary, let it be brought forward, then j
the house would know upon what ground they
acted. If tins was a true late of the cafe, lie <
thought -it would be highly improper to go
into a consideration of this fubjett at all, asit 1
would be giving a fanftion to the proceedings 1
of this house, which would be very inconve
rtrent and improper. And if the mover (whose
property it was) had 110 objefction to let the
motion lie, why should his colleague wish it
to be considered.
Mr. Nicholas said, he had no right to
expect the genileman from South-Carolina
would" liffen to what he (aid ; if he had, how
ever, he might trave ms remarks. He
had ifcited it was not his delire to enquire into
a particular cafe ; yet that cafe had made it
necetlary to have anew rule. It was not in
tended to enquire into the conduit of the
officer of the house ; but to provide forthe
future. Mr. N. thought the gentleman from
South-Carolina understood the business of 1
the house better, than to fay the resolution
was the property of any one ; it was the pro
perly of the house. With refpetl to the ef
fect it would have, if agreed to, he was much
mistaken. It could not be supposed to fane- j
tion the debate of any man. The resolution ;
was patTed, before it was known who w.ould '
| come to take the debates: it could not, there- 1
fore, sanction any publication of debates.-r
- was sensible, from the nature of the busi
ness, that there mud be inaccuracies in reports
of their proceedings ; but they were never
, thelefs valuable to the public and the house
ought to render the reporters as indepen
~ dent and eligible as they could be. It was a
business which was attended with gt'eat labour
j and fatigue, and required talents of a peculiar
kind. He wished them therefore to be placed
upon the bell footing upon which they could
be pur, and every encouragement given to
them, short of pledging the lioufe for the ac-
curacy of theirreports.
Mr. MACoto was in hopes thatas thisquef
tion jlad not bfen debated in the coninmtee of
e the whole, it would not have been debated in
thehoufe. If it was tiie intention of the house
to give leave to the committee to fit again, it
* would be bed to make the business the order
for some, distant day.
Mr. SgwALL laid, the gentleman from
Virginia argued as if there tfas no rule exiftin"
on this subject. The Speaker had every
power for preserving the order of the house,
_ which was not expreisly provided for by rule,
j and could, ofcourlc, give leave to any per
)f son whom he thought proper to attend on the
l( floor tip take down the debates ; but it was
n now wiihed that every person who calls him
fc'f a Stenugrapher should be admitted, with
j out refpeit to decency of character or appear
j ance ; and if any perf on of this sacred charac
ter .should attend whom the Speaker thtnks
j improper, a question mull be taken, before
' he can be discharged. So that a Stenogra
n f her was to have an advantage over every
l other citizen, and to be independent ot the
Speakerâthey were to be exalted even above
e the members themselves ; for members were
le subject to the order of the Speaker. If - a t

| were under the infpect.oniof the
far as relates to decency and
' duct- not only to call member, to older, but to
Set any dWbrd,r in or to turn
,aw person out of them. But there had been
;t din uction atlumed which he did not under
i ftaiid, viz . that out of
our the bar ot the House, is a place m which
(tranters uuy come, and may not come- ,
tuiderflood that a member or the Speake
miiiht introduce any person there. But I
wilbed to have this matter afcertamed ; and
to know whether, any Itranger may be admit
ted, how, and how excluded. He did not
with to reflriCt the authority of the Speaker
within the fe walls; but he did not fee the
iropriptv of turning out any person that was
not debarred, admiflion by the rules of tne
Haute, He knew that the Speaker had a right
to tufcn out any person who in.l'Dthdved WÂ»n
feif ; but'if he were to have rhe powerot ex
ciudiiigtotHc'rs, he wished it to be ascertained
by rule ; !or it iie'hinifclf were to introduce a
gentleman on .his floor, and the Speaker was,
torfome turn hiin out, he should
not feel [The Speaker thought
these observations improper winllt he was in
the chair.] Mr.'G. laid he did not allude to
any particular person, or to any particular
Speaker. He (poke generally, flnd wished to
ascertain whether it vvas not better to provide
by a rule whether certain powers were in the
Speaker, or in the House ; and he was going
! to fay, that this was a question which might
be fettled without irritation. And it was
because the Speaker tf-as in the chair, that he
took a cafe which could not exist. He thought
it belt to take up the subjeCt on a general
ground, and to fix these regulations by rule,
rather than leave them as they now are. If
It was thought proper to vest this power in the
Speaker, let it be so ; or if any provition was
niade in favour of nole-takers, which, of
course, would be for the interellof members,
as it gave them a better opportunity of hear
ing and taking dpVn the debates, they ought
to dt> so. He said, he avoided taking any no
tice of the resolution with respect to debate
taker.i, as the question was 011 leave being
given to the committee to fit again. Mr.
G. laid, before he fat down, lie would notice
oneobfervation which he thought very extra
ordinary. -j(t was, that the people generally
believed the Clerk of the House reponejf-rfrc
debate's, and'that it vvas done under the sanc
tion of the House, He himfelf lived in a ve
ry remote part of the union, where the people
had not access tÂ» such ample information as
in other parts, but he never heard such an o
pinion uttered. The people at large pretty
w ell understood that the debates are taken by
persons who attended, for their own use,
whicji w ere correCt, orotherwile, in proporti
on as 1 speaker is perfpicaous or not, or ac
cording as they hear and mjderftand, 01" as
they pofTefs the ability Jo Inake the report.
He hoped the committee would have leave to
fit again, and that the question would be de
bated 011 a future day, when he trusted it
would be difcufied on general ground.
Mr. Gtis. It appeared to him that the 1
gentltman from Pennsylvania had afligned
reasons why some general rule ought to be
eftabliihed with respeCt to the admission of
ftrangets; but he saw nothing of that kind
contemplated by the resolution, therefore it
could rot embrace the objedts he had in view.
It was-anfined to (lenographers merely, with
rqfpeCt to whom he saw no neceflity for mak
ing anyrule. Ttffy attended when they pleas
ed in the House ; if any had been injured
from adenial of this privilege, and that inju
ry was (hewn to the House, it be good
ground for making a rule upon the fubjget.â
With respect to .SYiiathad fallen from the p-fn
tTemau from Virginia JS to rnsTTaDit ot uling
irritating expredions ; he believed it would be
the beftvvay of preventing irritation to take
no notice of them. He would only fay, that
he belie/ed the gentleman's own irritability
gave rife to the remark, and not any thing lie
had said.
Mr. Dawson observed, the arguments of
gentlemen shewed the propriety of the com
mittee's having leave to fit again. He should
not, at present, reply to had been said,
because he thought the debate on this subjeCt
ought to take place in a committee of the
whole. He would agree with the gentleman
from S, Carolina to take up the subjeCt about
the the middle of April. If this was declin
ed, gentlemen would force them into a discus
sion at present.
Mr. Lyon hoped the committee would
have leave to fit again, and that the farther
conlideration would not be deferred to the
time mentioned. He thought it of great im
portance that the proceedings of the Honf'e
(hould be faithfully reported. When he firft
took his feat in the House, there were fix per
sons attended to take down notes ; now, he
said, there is only oneâand if he should be
taken sick, or stay away from any cause, the
public would be unacquainted wilh the pro
ceedings of the House.
Mr. Bayard observed that the gentleman
from Pennfylvsnta had told the House a num
ber of things he did not know ; amongst these
was the ground upon which the Speaker had a
right to turn out strangers from the lobby of
the House. Mr. B. was surprized that gen
tleman w ho knew so much, should be ignorant
of this. There was fcavcely a member in the
House, he had thought, who did not know
that the House was divided into different
parts ; one of which waÂ§ for the members,
and another Tor strangers. The part attuned
to members was the floor and the lobby ;Â°and
the galleries for those who chose to attend
their proceedings. With respeCt to the lob
by, the Speaker, as the general coiifervator
CI peace and order in the House, had the fame
charge over it, as over other parts of the
House. If any person, who is not a member '
were to take a member's feat, the Speaker
would undoubtedly turn him out, and he had
the fame right to order any person out of the
lobby. But the gentleman said there was no
ru.e upon the fubjeCt. Nor could there be
any ; for though .gentlemen sometimes intro
duced their friends into the lobby of the
House, which vvas a thing of courtesy, thev
certainly had no right to do so.
With refpea to the general principle, whe
ther this power belonged to ths Speaker or
not, lie vvas aftomlhcd that this should have
beende.ubtcd, as U fubordinate
to otners placed m that olficer; and he could
witho - ,lt reference,
to artotfter circumffance. Was he not an offi.
cer ot great cortfequence both as to hu inte
he Â£Â£Â£ ,lU f l,i^ nCe ? Was power
ne po(Te(Tes, of calling any member to order â¢
of appointing all committees, See. of a far
igher magnitude ? And when he iiad these 1
powers, could it be doubted that he had the
Perf Â° nS Trom the 'obby
inflateÂ°! Renting his being.re
initate.t Belides, let the word use of this
power be supposed. Suppose the Speaker to

If Se ml"trowed were adopted, a majority
of the House could do no more than theymm g
a/s There was, however, too much rea

ness to be postponed to a distant day, bccanla j
it was proper the public fltould know vvhati s

know that the proceedings of every day were
regularly published i And will any gen
tleman (ay they are partially given? tie
believed n&t; he heard no complaint liom
either lide of the house. He believed the bu
siness was asarcurate'y done, as the nature of it
would admit of j and when there were half a
dozen note--takrrs ; he had observed, and it
that member had read, he would have observ
ed, that the mod of them copied the debates
"written by the ftenograplÂ« now before hint.
He thought, therefore, there was no neceflity
for any change in the business. He wished tor
publiqity poffiblc, and that the
people might not Only know what they said,
but also what they did.
Mr. Gallatin replied to theobfervations
of Mr. Bayard, by (fating, that he was ac
quainted with the rules of the house ?.s they
had been agreed to and were before them,but
ignorant of.ar.y other rule which w as not con
tained there. He wished all their rules to be
explicit.
Mr. Gordon hoped the committee would
nothave leave to fitagain. He had heard no rea
f&ttftovine** hi in â  -
tsbe difchargedOoi* a farther confiderationof
the fubjeCt. All the arguments which had
been otferedwent to the general ground of ad
mitting Grangers on the floor of the house,
whereas the refofution before the house was
confined to He wished no re
gulation on thi's fubjeft. The gentleman front
Pennsylvania had said that if he were to bring
a gentleman within the walls and he were to
be turned out, he should be very much hurt ;
he would venture to fay, that if he introduced
none but gentlemen, he would never have his
feelings thus hurt.
Mr. Hartley hoped the committee of the
whole would not be discharged, but have
leave to (it again at a future day. The Speak
er, he remarked, was in a vfry aukward situ
ation in the difcuflion ; he wished him to be
at liberty to answer any insinuation Which
might be made against his conduCt.
The Speaker thought it his duty to fay,
that he had heard no personal insinuations to
vva ds himfelfif he had, he should not ask
the house to go intoa committee of thewhole
to get clear of them.
Mr. Lyon denied having infinpated the de
bates were at present improperly reported ;
he thought the business well done. All he
had said was, that there were formerly fix re
porters, and now ojily one ; and he wished the
â  't&Sjlj'tiv' l f '' %/tffnijted, left rbstnnr should -
awayâby The lame power which
had sent off the others.
The Speaker said the remark of themem
ber from Vermont was very improper and
indecent.
The question for leave to fit again was ne
gatived 46 to 40.
Mr. N. Smith proposed to postpone the
farther confederation of this fubjeCl to the 4th
of March next. v
Mr. Harper wasoppofed to this motion ;
it was not to give the go-by to this
question. He had no desire to avoid it. He
was fatisfied that whenever the business was
gone into, the report of the feledt committee
would be agreed to. He ,hoped, therefore,
the third Monday in April would be prefer
red.
Mr. Brooks would have no objeftion to
discuss this business, if it had not already been
difculfed. He was in favour of the 4th of
March, as he perceived the gentleman from
Pennsylvania wished to introduce several other
regulations into the difcuflion, as to the ad
mission of (hungers, See.
Mr. Nicholas said, he had avoided as
much as poflible entering into this Ulifcufiion
at present. He had averted the necefiil;y of a
.rule of thy kind, .in order to set the note
takers upon a more respectable footing than
at present.
Mr. Gallatin made fomc' remarks against
the poftpontmerit.
Mr. RuTLEDGEfaid that he had supposed
that it was perfectly well understood that (hort
hand writex%were admitted 011 the floor thro'
the Speaker's indulgence, becatife it was a
privilege not granted to the reft of our fellow -
citizens, who were admitted into the galleries
and lobby only, and that as by the rules he
had authority to order any firanger to be turn
ed out for disorderly conduct, or both galleries
and lobbies to be cleared entirely in cafe of
more genera] disorder, or where he could not
distinguish and (ingle out the unruly indivi
dual, so he had believed that no one doubted
his authority r revoke the indulgence thus
, granted to stenographers.
He requested however that the Speaker, al
though in the,chair, would do the doubting
gentleman from Pennsylvania the favour to
liate 1111 what manner this business had been
conducted, in order to diTpel the doubts of
t at member, orot any other who entertained
them ; a.though Mr. Rutledge declared that
he tor himfelf had none,'and-was fatisfied.
1 he Speaker rofetrom the chair, and said
that he felt very much disposed to gratify the
gentleman from South-Carolina in any request
he might think proper to make, but that in â¢
this instance it would be tifelefs, because he
* : ' 3 !Â£ e t Â® lat t,le member from Pennsylvania

he did not seriously entertain the doubts he had
I exprefred, but that they were suggested rather
"it 1 a design to catch file popular ear, than
with any expectation or willi that tliey should
be duelled.
Mr. Gallatin said, he understood fiiat it
was undei the courtesy of the Speaker that
persons were admitted on tl-.c floor of the

BRITISH PARLIAMENT.
HOUSE OF COMMONS.
FRIDAY DiCSMBBR 22.
The question being put for the third read
ing of the bill for raffing three millions from
the Bank upon Exchequer bills,
Mr. Tieriuy said, it was impo(ftbl c for
him to afTent to that bill without faying a
few words. It appeared to he a measure
quite incontinent with the proftfiions of the
Chancellor of the Excheqner upon occasions
for which he had coufiderablt credit at the
time |ie .made them, and which he would
contmuÂ® to have if he adheted to his prefef
lioawec 4he substance of which was, that
tbWe should never be issued any exchequer
bills for whicb there was not made an ade
quate parliamentary provision. It wa3 ne
. ceffary to adhere to this prinuiple at all
times, but more particularly so at the pre
sent time, when the right honorable gentle
man was calling upon the public to contri-
J bute so large a sum to defray expences, and
to raise it within the year. The miiiifttr
had Hated the sum to be provided this year
to be 25 millions; twelve millions of which
he ropofed to be raised by a loan, of which
we as yet heard nothing but the amount ,
eight millions he prop,fed to be raised by
the additional afleffmerit upon tÂ«xes ; three
millions and a half upon land and malt, and
three millions upon exchequer bills, the bill
for raising which sum was now before the
house. How this la ft sum of money was
to be provided for, did not appear. The
minister had said that we mult look our
difficulties in the face. He granted that we
should do so. But this did not appear to
him to be the way of doing it ; for by this
bill, in Read of meeting, it was postponing
our difficulty to the amount of three millions
and that two in a way perfeftly new. It
â was possible that there fbonld be- trovv out-"
â¢fianding four milKons upon exchequer bills.
But how these millions now to be voted by
this biil were to be provided for, no man
had heird a word. No provifiou was made
for the iflue of frefh' exchequer bills, when
tbefe should become payable, which will be
on tb? 4th of April next. Should the min
ister ifiue exchequer bills for three millions
wiore to answer for when thjy become due,
there would then be fix millions unprovided
for. Considering the discount upon exche
quer bills, he would ask, whether the min
ister thought i: prudent to issue them again,
after these became payable, foppofing the
bank to have no obje&ion, and foppofing
neither to be provided for by Parliament ?
He was sure that this mode of proceeding
was entirely different from that for which,
two years ago, the Chancellor of the ex
chequer took a great deal of credit, that of
providing for exchequer bills in a manner
that had not been done before. But he
seemed now to abandon his plan ; and the
manner in which the Bank acquiesced in
the plans of the minister was, in his opinion,
alarming to those whowifhed-well tn the cre
dit of thit .(MBrfc They ae^ommoasteT
the Chancellor ofthe exchequer in a way that
wfts not highly creditable to either party.
They stated -heir ciicumdancesto be flour
ifhing, but that, with a view to public fi
nancial operations, they ftetned to invite a
continuance of the reflriclion upon them
aS to the payments of their debts in fpetie.
What would be said of a private man who
would thus league himfelf with the exec
utive government, and for that rcafon re
fiife to pay his debts, was a question which,
he apprehended, wa? not difficult to an
swer. The bank and the chancellor of the
exchequer agreed with one another that the
TeftriStion should eoutfnue, as to the ifTuing
cf cafli by the bank. They agree further
to, advance to him three millions tipnn ex
chequer tills, for which at present no par
liamentary provision is made. At the end
of fix months the chancellor of the exche
quer is called upon to make good the pay
ments of tbefe exchequer bills. Supposing
then, that provision should be made for the
payment of three millions upon frefh exche
quer bills at three months, the question then
would be, whether we are likely, in the
month of April next, to be in a more pros
perous (late than we are at present, and
that money will be more plenty ? Then
there would be no objeftion to any
thing but the expence of this measure.
Bat those who thought there was
danger in opr present situation, could
hardly approve of the present measure ; be
cause, if the hour of difficulty should arise,
and neither the dire&ors of the bank fhoiild
be disposed to grant any further money up
on exchequer bills, nor the proprietors agree
to it if they did, then indeed shall we fee
the mifchief of voting away money thus up
on credit without making provision for
the payment of it. Although he differed
from the minister on the fubjeft of raising
money within the year, he did not differ
from him as to the necessity of our looking
our difficulty in the face, and providing
for it ; but Ire did not think it confident
with that idea to peftpone that difficulty by
a measure, the pretense for which was to
provide for it. He thought he should be
prepared for a storm, but he should be pre
pared forit like prudent and fkilful manures
so as to be ready to meet it, not to talk of
a storm artcffendutl ourselves as if nothing
was to be apprehended but a calm, apd to j
postpone the preparation to tbe hour of tcm- '
pell, which appeared to him to be the cafe
as far as the present bill extended. He
eould e*large on these topics, but he had
r'pafotis for forbearing.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said,
he was very glad to notice that the honor
able gentleman had, on this day, more dif
tindlly than he had heard him before, ac
knowledge that we ought to meet our diffi
culties in th* face. He fbould rejoice if that
declaration of the honorable gentleman was
likely to be followed up by a plan that would
contribute to the ientiment which it convey*
.
reafonswrhy lie thought tint the present plan
was not confident with that object ; an J if
â ie did so, aad the appeared conclu- j
Uve, he (hould be as ready to abandon i* as
he noped the hon. gentlemen would to a- j
b in don his opinions if ht found them incon
j. Hkent with the general objedt, namely, that
m Â°' meeting our d ffleulties in the face. He
neither wished to be himfelf mifundeTftood
I}r nor to nufundsrftand the-honorable gentle
a man. The bill now before the house wis
not mconfi.lent with the plan for the j
1e mentation of the afTefTcd taxes. He d?d
n8 Â»ot mean to raise the whole of the supplies \
;le of the present year within the year. laleedi
Id P ro fÂ°fed olherwife when iie wpened the
, { outline of the wh.ijc.plan. He stated the
at measure now before the Cmufe as part of the
er original proportion. With regard to the
e _ rellridlion upon the bank, it had been alrea
e. dy decided by the house that it was necclTi
,]] ry during the contiiiujnie of the war.-r
- There was iro hope that fuck necessity would
e . cease but with the war. Here the bank,
without inconvenience to themselves or tlie
id Public, but with advantage to both, can
tr make this advance, and can prolong it : and
a _ here was a provision for the payment at a
â¢h cert3ln pertod, in order th.it if necessary,
:h 'key m 'gbt open their ulual operation of
. payment, if it should be thought wife to o
}y pen. While the present ciregmft ances rs
ee main,the ieftriÂ£iion should continue.
i( j If it thould be necelfary that the bankfhould
continue it# advances, they would of course
; u . continue, bat by, u very bilf imw before
as house, was made for the pay
nr.rnt from time to time as such advances
ur (hould be made. Their continuance, or dif
ve continuance of advances wouH depend up
tQ On their circumlhnces and although they
â¢ s are at prefers in a flourifhing situation, yet
they should not be called upon to make jid
ns vancts u P on exchequer bills but to a limited
j t amount, such as was fpecified by the present
t _ hill. With tusgnrd. to.th--.' difcouut uu ex--
[. chequer bills, he knew of none.
,' Mr- Tierney said, he understood the dif
in COQn t upon exchequer bills to be at present
onc afi d a half per cent. He had heard no
thiDg against wkat he had said already, that
this was matter of accommodation from the
n _ batik to the chancellor of the Exchequer,
n6 and that it was likely to be mischievous to
e the public. WiÂ»h regard to the pledge
which he wa< fuppn ed to have entered into
e _ by the chanctllor of the exchequer, he
n _ cculd only fay, that he had said uotSingex
cept.that we ought not to poltpone our dif-
Acuities. He wanted to know where tl.eie
three milhoi s could be raised again if the
j bank {hould find any difficulty.
Mr. Nichols did not fee how thte bill
was to be provided for except in the ifluing
| of bank notes". There bad formerly, been a
limit to the issue of bank paper. Now there
was none. This measure was calculated to
make the bank a mint for the coinage of
paper money. This was worse than the
j n mode that was adopted in Fiance, for there
they had a limit, here we have none. Should
' they be unable to pay again, what wa* to
-j feÂ» tViis frwedv ? hiili tti be
the mod dangerous,meafure that was ever
tried in any country.
The bill was then read a third time and
|T" pafied.

c ~ ExtraH of a letter, dated Cayenne, February
e - 11, 1798.
My dear Sir,
n * My heart is grievously afflifted. I
lc have just seen one of the urrfortiinate depu
ties transported from France. This was
'S one of my moil precious cares in landing.
Jr I cannot give you a better knowledge of
s " .heir situation, than by following his own
r " narrative, with the fame freedom as he
'd communicated it to me. It will lam sure i
e " call forth a flood of tears. It has made an j
f" imprefiion on my mind, which I can nevtr j
S forget.
Ie <Â« You know, said he, the manner in
e " which we were conveyed through France
n in carriages barred witb iron, deeping fome
lc times in prisonÂ» f and sometimes in dun
s- gcons. Our voyage was like our journey,
d crouded some against, others beneath the
'* deck, which was guarded night and day,
y by two soldiers with drawn sabres ; we were
fed like sailors, with fait meat, white beans
ls and biscuit, but so damaged that it is in
d conceivable how it could nourish even the
sailors. We all supported tolerably well,
'> this honible voyage, during which, we
3 were constantly treated as criminalsâThe
" 'orders were that we should speak to none of
e the crew.
e After 53 days failing we arrived at this
- place. We were ordered to go down to
r the hospital, where we have been well treat
i ed as to provisions. But we have been con
? ftantly under a military guard ; without
r the liberty of walking out, except atl hour
? in the morning and another in the evening
? in a meadow, which is without the walls of
1 the hospital, and without pcrmiffioti to be
f visited.
' We entertained hopes that when arrived
e at the place of our destination, we should
" have enjoyed our personal freedom. But
! we have beta disappointed.
' In about 15 day* we were transported by
I water to Sinamary, a village situated about
> I 25 leagues from Cayenne, a wretched place,
â¢ ' unhealthy, difHtote of every convenience.
: We are here lodged in the house of the for
â  mer clergyman, containing five small rooms,
' in vvliich we are distributed. We are fur
: rounded by snakes, huge serpents fcorpi
, ons and with a thoufafid other venomous
beasts, large and fnsall, with which this
country is overrun. Tigers are our near 1
neighbors. A small piece of ground is as. 1
signed to us for a walk ; but so excessive is '
the heat of the fun and the rains, and so j
numerous the infects which swarm over the
country, that our walks are rendered ex.
tremely inconvenient. We are under a mi.
i litary guaid. Tiiii village is iulnihued by
about 50 pcrf ns, all tick of a ftver. Th.tt â¢

We had hoped for some mitigation of our
fate from France ; buton hearing that others
were to fee traufportcd here, how cruel will
be our future lot ! We have no hope, but
to perifli by a flow and painful death in this
terrible climate, the grave of Europeans,
whatever may be said of it by fabulous writ

BAL riMORE, March. 20.
Extract of a letter from captain Juncker,
master of the (hip William, bound from
Balfmore for Bremen, to his owners in
this city, dated
" Bremen, 9 1. |
" Thirteen days after leaving the Capes
I made the foundings of the baolts of New
foundland ; the next day a veflel hove in
fight, which proved to be a French privateer ;
who, on coming up, ordered m* to hoist Â»Â»t
the boat and repair on boardâit was then
blowing a tremendous llorm, with a high
running sea ; I replied it was utterly out of
my power, as no boat I thought, could keep
the seaâhe answered me by opening his
port-hole 3 and made ready to fire. Although
my dead lights had been beaten in, my bow- j
sprit carried away, my rudder unhooked and |
the veflel had other-ways fnffered much, I
was dill obliged to comply. Two men,
the carpenter and the boatfwin, ventured
withme. Hardly had we, with much difficul
ty, reached the privateer, when the boat was
ftoved to pieces, and the carpenter unfortu
nately drowned, the boatswain was miracu
louffy saved, The captain of the privateer
then proceeded toexamine my papers, which
proving to be in the he en
deavoured, by threats, such as prtfenting
a loaded pistol to my breast, Â£cc. to intimi
date me, with a view of forcing me to de
clart in writing, that I was bound to Eng
land. Finding all his measures iieffectual,
he ft ruck me fevercly ; this producing no

MR. FENNO,
A member of 3 drinking company
complains bitterly in the Aurora of this
morning that Mr. Brown had withheld
from the public a number of toasts which he
hadpromifedtopnblifhâHethinks Brown's
condud in this instance at variance with his
, motto, " The public will our guide, the
a public good our end."
\ Ferhaps Mr. BrowH, like many other per
t sons, has altered his opinion of the public
Â£ will and public good, and in this very refuf
jal has complied with bothâThe public o
g pinion is very fall changing. Many, who
1 were formerly unconcerned fpeftators of our
. dispute with France, or if you please honest
ly attached to France, are now rallying
round the standard of our own government.
Beside, I believe Mr. Brown finds that but
few of those who have formerly, considered
thcmfelrcs as the index* of the public will,
ate able now to pay for his papersâSo that
I believe Mr. Brown in nrgleding to pub
s lifii the toasts has adled irt perfect conform! - ,
r ty to his motto
e And I further believe that the crisis has
c now arrived, in which, all Printers in the
United States, who are not well paid by
France, must adopt the fame measure with
Brown, or they will not be able to print
, much longer. A Cl/STOMER.

Gentlemen,
J I FIND in your paper of thiÂ» morning the names
of the members who voted for and against the mo
_ tion, for postponing tffc further consideration of the
following question in the Hoiife of Reprefentati (es
of the United States, until the 4th of March next:
" That persons attending the House for the purpose
"of taking down the debates and proceedings,
" should be permitted to take their places within the
" bar of the House." Among th; Yeas, I find J.
Parker. As I was not ia the House at the time of
the vote, being confined to my room, and unable to
! attÂ«nd, I presume it must have bees Mr. Isaac Par
ker, that voted on that question. In order to pre
vent mistakes in future, I have to request you will
either give my Christian name, or nots " Virginia,"
to any vote I may give in the House of Representa
tives ; as at this eventful crisis, it must be unpleasant
, for any member of Congress to fee his name affixed
to a vote which he does not approve of. You will
please to publish this in your paper, and I hope the
other printers will do the fame, who may have com
mitted the error.
I am refpedtfully, your's, &c.
