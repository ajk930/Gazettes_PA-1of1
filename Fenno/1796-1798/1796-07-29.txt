For the Gazette of the UnitebStates
n<>. nr.
THE Constitution of the United State 3 is fotin
ded on principles oF equalityâEvery citizen is
born with a right to participate in sit its advanta
ges. In this refpedt we all ftait from the fame
point in the journey of lifeâbut alas! how soon
do the advantages of education, which fume enjoy
over others, enable them to dillauce their contem
poraries !
It is this which creates those difparitics, that en
genderthe bitterneflei of social efciftenceâEnvy on
'he one hand, and ambition on the other. It is ac
knowledged that nature sports an endleis, variety
in forming the human mind. Genius however, is
more equally d'fpenfed than may at firtl view be
imagined.
in the prifent difeuflion, this consideration has
little weight. The objeet is to taften this idea un
the mind, viz. That the people being born
rights, ju.tice requires that the government should
as far as possible place them in a capacity to enjoy
those rights. We complain of monopoliesâof the
power of richesâof the burthens of Society. The
causes of these complaints wiH continue and accu
mulate, so long as the present monopoly of learn
ing continues.
A monopoly of all others the most injurious, be
cause it will in time acquire an inveteracy ; which
it will be unpopular to attempt- to remove. This
monopoly is disregarded by those who fuflfer from
its effects ; and generally in the fame proportion.
Its operation tho' fatal, is gradual, and therefore
the less obvious. Those who Inoiv nothing, feel
few irjmies; it is the\:apacity for enjayment which
originates in an extension of the humait faculties
that enables mankind to dillinguifh negative misery,
and positive good. I know that this observation
has been obtruded on the world in defence of keep
ing the majority in ignorance. Ueiefted be the
policy. It is the meafnre of tyrants to (laves or
rather it is the connedtirg link that binds the lat
ter to the former.
The Conftituiion of the United States, has le
velled all the pretensions of fupeiiority, which are
not founded on fupetior merit. It holds out the
moll powerful motives to excel in all those estimable
endowments, which give worth to the human cha
rter, by placing within probable attainment, by
the cluldien of thepoorcft citizen in the Republic,
the highest honors of the unionâbetween them, and
these objects, what is there that intervenes, but our
own negligcnce i
The Legislature of this Commonwealth labored
twofeflions on the fubjeatfeducation, and brought
nothing to pass. Some fay that worse than bare
creation is before an holt of prejudices
impede iheir way. In addition to these difficul
ties, it has been afTerted in a public paper, that the
men of property opposed the business. Ido not
believe this foul aspersion on their understandings,
has a balis to support it. If it has, it will fh'ew '
that as the completion of this business is peculiarly
the interest of the general mass of the citizens, so on
them alone depends the bringing forward men who
will honeltly adopt and pursue those' measures,
which will eventually result in the accomplrftiment
of this important objedâln my next, I propose to
point.out some of the methods neeeflary to be re
sorted to, on the part of those who realize how im.
portanc a general diffufion of kaowledge among the
people is, to the piefervation of the Republican
chara&er.

" V'i/t t^su well to be angry for the gourd?
OR to fret, at any of t * petty accidents of
life ? 1 hou discontented mortal, undoubted defend
ant from Jonah, and his peevish tribe, why dost
thou fuller a cloud to gather on thy brow, because
there re a hjtle one, no bigger than a man's hand,
riling in the sky ? Be serene thyfelf, and it will
import little, whether it raint or'blows.
Of all vile habits, that of fretfulnefs is the lead
tolerable. Many offenfive things, which vulgar
people do, are sometimes laid aside, and their neigh
hours are occafiorially freed from annoy. But fret
fulnefs is a kind of perpetual motion, excited no
lef. by a creaking rioor, than a fit of the gout. It
is a voracious monlter and fÂ« ds upon -|inme as
wH as vast vexation. Let us drive, therefore, to
pluck off this blitter from the heart, and, even in
the hottest, and most opprefTive days of life, care
not wUeth-uhe duller of a Â« goard" be expended
over us, or token away. I | iave âl wa -Â«i
ever bnce the fchoolmuiref. bid me rrad, with a
loud voice, Jonah's journey to Nineveh, tl at tir

that a deid Â«Â« goard" would not give him the fpleeo.
I cannot help feeling a degree of indifference, and,
perhaps, averfioi. towards this ftetting
to the Ninevites. 1 have a profound "nlptd r,.r

tered a pteditlii.n. But as for Jonah, fctting alidc
his disobedience, feltifhnefs and vanity, he was so
sulky a;id lo morose a mortal that I never could like
his character or his principles. I am not fÂ« un
charitable, as to with that he haj actually beep Ji
gefted by the whale, which swallowed him, but he
ought to have kept no better company ; for not â¢
the " irreat Leviathsn of the deep ever floundered
more impatiently in his element, than dilcomented
Jonah, in the voyage of life.
On a review of what 1 have, thus far Written,
I believe (bat there is qo occafiou to look so far

iiflance of anger employed upon trifles. If J

THE LAY PREACHER.
NEW-YORK.
j Out country presents us, in all quarters, with most
abundaÃt crops, The hay is iu vast quantities, and
of the bed quality. The rains of May and June
p caused a full growtji, and the fucceediiig- dry i-fi
j then enabled the farmer to gather and it in.the
bell manner. Ihe oats and flax are equally abund
s anl,
1 Never were greater crops of wheat and rye. In
a few particular iituations the wheat is blalfed, but
_ as a general rcmaik, the wheat is excellent, and in
f greater quantities than ever has been before known.
r Unulusl quantities of old wheat also remain en
hand. The spirit of speculation and monopoly had
hoarded immense quantities for a high market. E
ven the farmers, in some places, had flored their â 
wheat and flour, in oar market-towns, waiting for
an increase of price. The sudden fall of price has
disappointed their hopes, and made them repent
their foil*.
_ The fatal consequences of the fall of provisions
In Eutope, upon a great number of American mer.
j chants are sincerely to be regretted. Yet these con
r f quences were expected, and Tiavc been repeatedly
foretold ; and nothing would repress the daring
j spirit of speculation. The great art of profiling by
speculation, is to be the firft to observe changes in
. 'he ffiaikets abroad, and engage e</r/y in supplying
} tl.em. The moment a good market bet'omes 'Â«*//
. known, and competition it is time
, for a prudent merchant todefill.
Thete seems, however, more than human pro
vidence and arrangement, indisposing of the profits
r *of business.. Men, who, by grÂ«at successes, haie
r accumulated immense sums of money, or vsfl ef
t tates in land, and who appear to be lapidly pro
( greffing to the poffefiion of dangerous power and
wealth, seem doomed by heaven to perfilt ,in their
. designs, till they lose mod or all their acquisitions.
( It is a lamentable, but common truth, that men
fiiddenly rsi fed to wealth and power, lose a great
, portion of their mod efteernable qualities. Mutual
. wants are the nurses of foeial virtueâplace a man
, beyond those wants, and he instantly lofts those fine
feelings of sympathy and benevolence, whith God
Almighty dellined to coaflitute the principal fcur
ces of public and private virtues. No country on
earth can furriifh more examples of these truths, tbaa
America within a few yeats.
f Yet how few of all those who once appeared to be
hafteoing to fortunes like principalities,have arrived
to the point of their wi(beÂ» 1 The moll dangeioos
chara&eis have been arrelled in their career, and

conquered the whole North of Italy, hath vanquith- 1

one of thpfc masterly fl'okcs which hath iu denly y' l
changed the political face of Europe. Already the 111
neighbouiing powers have purchased by lubmiffion ln
and by military contributions, the preftrvatioii. of
their estates : the others press forward, not 13
to acknowledge the Republic, but to sue for its |
friendfhip. The court of Naples and of Rome be j 112

drives from its territories, the emigrants, together
with their chief, and fefufe3 an asylum to Beau

this thunderbolt, hath resounded on the banks of pr
the Rhine ;it hath inflamed our armies with emula- th
tion, and hath tilled those of our enemies with con- bÂ«
ftcrnation. The court of Vienna for not know. g<

Fiance which they would have effaced from the tl
map of Europe, has become now the most diftin- z
guithed part of it. That republic which they h
thought to have divided and (hared, now limits the ti

doubled by the fpirit'of liberty which refinance has r
â¢ited by the has.it of conquests to which they d
vc forced it, by the force, of a constitutional go t
