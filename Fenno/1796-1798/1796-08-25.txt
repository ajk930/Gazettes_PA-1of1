LAW REPORT.
BVCHAN V. SWAINJON.
This was an attion brought by Dr. Buchan to
recover damages against Mr. Swainfon, Proprietor
of Velno's Vegetable Syrup.
Mr. Erfkine, Counsel for the Plaintiff, ftafed
that his Client having, in a book which he publish
ed, made some unfavourable observations upon the
vegetable syrup, Mr. Swainfon infeited an adver
tisement in a morning paper, refle&ing very severe
ly upon Dr. Buchan. Mr. Erfkine said, he was
not inflrudled by his client to make any attack up
on Mr. Swainfon, or to decry the virtues of his
medicine ; but he conceived that Dr. B. had a
right, in a fair disquisition on a medical fubjeft, to
give an opinion upon that, or any other medicine.
He (hea called a witness to prove the publicati
on of the advertisement by the defendant.
After which, Mr. Mingay made a very ingeni
ous speech for the defendant.âHe contended that
Dr. Buchan had no right to complain ,of this as- '
fault upon his character, because it appeared that
he had given the firft blow ;he began the attack by '
abuiing ihc defentlanr'r TireStclne, the property of >
wbichfhe had purchased at a great expence, and â 
consequently was extremely anxious, to protest it. 1
Mr. Mingay said, he had a number of witnesses in '
his brief, who, from experience, could prove the <
efficacy of this syrup in a certain cafe ; but he 1
thought it would not be quite proper to call them.
Lord Kenyon made fpvcral observations upon the
easeâsaid that he belived many of these medicines 1
were efficacious, but might be produ&ive of great ;
saifchief, by btiog taken without proper advice. f
The Jury, which was a special one, withdrew for t
a quarte- of an hoOr; after which they brought in a c
verdidt for the plaintiffâDamages 1001. c

to prove both these assertions. . 11
The troops ih geneial appeared animated with' c<
the mod fanguineexpc<3ation of success ; they jorut ai
Â«d for an engagement, and promised to rout the n
enemy, wherever they should find them. The ar
mistice has done wonders for the allied army the
men look well; and being refrefhed, and much bet- if
terclothed than usual, their appearanee isconfider- f<
ablyin favour of the cause for which they are so tl
eager to aft. l( is greatly to be lamented, however , w
that the Austrian Officers are tired of the war ; b
and that idea has, in too frequent instances, fnp- e'
pressed every sentiment of loyalty and of rational ft
patriotism. This may appear a paradox to those o

Lift Sunday, the 29th ult. the whole French ft
line fired a grand feu d; joye, as an act of tfiankfgiv- R
iiig for their unparalelled success in Italy. General V
Jourdan had previously informed his Royal High-,
liefs the Archduke of his intentions, left any alarm si
flioiild be caused, by the firing, in the Allied army, w
The 3"! ft, at three quarters after twelve, the 1 r<
French partially attacked the out-pofls* and took a
few prisoners of-Latour's dragoons. They attcmp- u
ted to make themfelvcs mafterjfc>f Kirn, which du- E
ring the cessation of hostilities was considered, on ti
both fides, as a neutral village ; but they were de- t<
seated by M. General Schellenber, after a smart
contest. The Saxons, in that affair, as in all others,
behaved well, and took about 50 prisoners, h
It was*remarked, rather judiciously, as being fin. I
gular, that the Archduke, who had put art end to C
the armifticc, should have allowed his outposts to r<
be attacked, asit was pretty generally expeftcd that tl
the Allies would have commenced the hostilities, a;
their previous conduit appearing to have been an rr
earnest of such intentions.
The Archduke, who had advanced very far, fc
thought fit to retire to Meffenheim, where head ti
quarters are to be this evening ; this falling off ex- I*
cites no small degree of astonishment ; as the allies tl
retreat, the French march on ; and it is extremely nn
pjobable that General Jourdan will have his'head- H
quarters to-day at Baumholder. It was theopini- al
on of the Allied-Generals that the enemy would tc
have immediately crossed the Mofella at the com- 01
sneiicem-ent of hostilities; but they reckoned with k<
out their holl.

The affairs in Italy continue to wear a cloudy 2fl
afpeft ; theeotmy on the 30th ult. had not entered ve
the Pope's dnmtnions ; but, at fcveral points, they m;
had marched into the Venetian territory, which in no
frawiton of Uesty irritated, beyocd the th;
Senate and the people. The French had reached
as far as Brescia, thirty-eight leagues from the ca
pita! sfthe Republic. The 28th, General 13cau
F lieu was within eight leagues of Manrya, which has
plenty of provifioni, and has 800 oxen within its
walls. The Tyrolian.i are all volunteering in de
fence of whatever they hold most dear and sacred ; 1
ing in proportion as they are equipped th'ey join the ar
nd, my. It seems to be the indention of the French to <
ing march to lnfpruck and Muniih ; but there is a
-ees moral certainty that they will be too vigotoufly
lit- opposed, to be able to effedt their all destroying pur
on pole. The Tyroleans are excellent soldiers, and go c
lies to battle with more pleasure than, several other rta
-ajl t ions proceed to a feait. 1
ich Count Metternich is on his way to the Court of J
de- London, on matters of the htgheft moment; mer-

lef- to assert thai they have certain proofs that his mis- 1
lion has a pacificatory tendency ; and what goes
still more to fandiion their belief is, that Heid-

evening. A Courier is arrived from Vienna, with g
to orders to the Afchduke to hold himlelf on the de- h

re- conceive the idea of returning to his former pofiti- tl

A CHARACTER.
TIM TRIANGLE is a whimfieal fellow, in
my opinion. An txcellent mathematician, a per
feÂ£l Webber* in geometry. Tim meafurcs the
parallax of Venus, folrc3 adfefted equations, or
projeÂ£ls a solar eclipse on his thumb naii, with
2 microfcopick accuracy. But Tim is not fatisfied
with such trivial attainments. Law, politics, re
r!" ligion, men and manners, are ind'feriminately fub
jefted to Tim's calculations. He can explain the
mechanism of the Federal Syflem, point out the
parts of the political machine, which are exposed
to the moli violent friction, or give dire&ions to a
G illatin for 1 ' flopping the wheels of government."
1 Tim underfltands the balance of power in Europe,
n and has drawn many a diagram to elucidate its
s principles. He has made great improvements up- 1
'â¢ on Montesquieu's theory, relative to the physical
18 influence of climate, in flamping the charaftc-r of
a nation. Forty-threr degrÂ«(Â« and thirty-three
'' minutes, fays Tim, is the latitude of perfeflion.-â
( * Rife to the pole, or recede to tFic equator, from
l Â® this parallel, and hutnin nature dwindles in arithme
" tical progreflion. Borrowing a hint from the iflge-
[ r .nious Dpdlor Rush, he has conflruÂ£led a scale, by
which the latitude of any place given, after miking
a fort of tare and tiett allowance for adventitious
circumftanees, he afcertaint the character of its
inhabitants. Tim illuflrates Lavater's phyfiogno
ray by conick fe&ions., and can guage the c<\pa
:e cit y a statesmen, or a barrel of porter, with
equal facility. He never ventures to decide upon i
the charafler of his mod intimate acquintance, till
he has taken the angle of incidence, which his
tiofc forms with the less prominent parts of his
visage.
Tim wants a wife, and threatens to lay siege to
'a young lady in the neighborhood, and to proceed
according to <he principles of taÂ£licks, till her
ladyfliip capitulates. PICTOR.

A very valuable Merchant Mill,
A DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and sundry STONE
-QUARRIES'to be let.
I will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Pd
towmac, for any term not iafs than seven, nor more than
eleven years, from the firli day of September next. The
mill-Jjouie is 42 by 40 feet, three ftoriss high, built With
stone, and has in it three pairs of sÂ»ftich Burr Stpnes, two
overshot 18 feet water-wheels, and Evans's machinery
complete, with every other thing proper and necessary for
carrying on the business with dispatch, and at as little ei
penfe as poftible, all in good order.âfrom the mill to my v
landing on tlie Potomac river, (whtrs craft, of any bur
then may deliver grain and take in flour) it ip about 40
yards, and from thence.by water tn George-Town,and
the City of W.alhingtcH, about 3 miles, and to Alexan
dria about 11 miles. This titration, aided by a fufficient
â  capital, Will command the ptodyce of a very extensive
back country, where large quantities of wheat and other
grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 3
to 10 miles less than to any market town up >11 the navi
gation of the Potowniae. There are on the premises a
large stone Coopers' flop, a stone granary, and a commo
dious miller s houffe. At the landing aforclaid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, which is in (treat for
wardnefs and probably will be finifiied the etifuing fall.
1 here are also on the premises, a Brewery and Dilrille
ry, built with stone, in them are three Hills, two coppers
or boilers, with every necessary article, all new, aiid in
good order, and l'ufficiently large to on the Brew
ery and Distillery upon a very extensive plai}. This prop- ,
erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my lafeds adjoining the premises, apd along the
banks of the river, where craft may lead with eafc and dis
patch, is an innaerife quantity of building and lounda
tion-ftones. Four quarritJ are now open, and as many
more may be opened v ith ease: the stone taken from these
quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries
separately or together as may best suit.
On the topol the hill, and about 200 yards from the
mill, is a stone Dwelling-house, iarg* enough for the ac
commodation of a family: Â»l!b, a kitchen, dairy, smoke
house, &c. and a garden, ehc'ofed and in cultivation, the
foil of which is equal in goodtwli to any in this state. I
will also rent this property.
Adjoining to the Brewery and Distillery Â« a Smith't
fliop, in which is a complete set of Blacksmith's t.~o)s.
whieM will also rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
tenant two negro blacksmiths, one of them is a complete
workman.
HI rent cut the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts,
which were built for the purpcfc of carrying stone : they
will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch. Immediate
poflefiion will be given. For terms apply to the fubferib
