11](1 could be better talculated to efL& this
at change, than to difpatcb an envoy from the
if body politic of Jacohiuifm, fully initiated
into the views of*its leaders, and inverted
with ample powers to concert fuo!i schemes
f as were raoft likely to ensure ultimate fuc
cess. Their craft no I'uonrr fti h 'gel!ed the
idea, thaftthe Folly and fanaticifm < f Lngan
c f furnifhed ihcm with an instrument. From
h e what has already happened, \ye may tn some
in- degree discover how well tlleir opinions
were founded ; and as the letter puhliflied
from hirafelf in fad confcffes that he has
acted in a political charades, his coududt is
the now a fuhject of public praise or condem
or. nation.
:rÂ«l An extract ptiblilhed from a Paris paper
:he some time since informed us, that he had
credentials from Jefferfon and M Kean,that
ibn be had dined with the notorious Merlin,
in prcfident of the DirÂ«dtory, and that he was
uvd sent for political purposes by the French
party in America. This publication has
w * now been made lome weeks ;it must have
been fcen by both of the pcrfons who are
said to have created this new species of drp
â lomatic eliarafler; they mud have both
kftown that it has excited the curiosity, and
)n roused the feelings of the whole nation; and
,tv. that if its truth was not denied, it would be
jro credited. From no such denial having been
Â±- made, and from the intrinsic probability of
JT* 'be aflertion, I fnall consider it as unquef
Â£ tionabty authentic. The constitution has
veiled in the Prelident alone, the manage
bc ment cf our exterior relations. To him be
of longs the right of appointing public minif
all ters * of . formi "S treaties, and of exprefling
Q [ our national sentiments. The Viee-Prefi
dent, conlidered as such, pofleffes no other
power than those which are attached to the
lw beÂ«i of a legislative body. The President
then entered into a negotiation with France,
ll as the legal reprefei.tative of the whole na
tion ; Mr. JefFerfon has entered into aoo
nt tfeer, as the reprefentauve of a profligate
ly fadtion. Let him not attempt to juitify--
S, himfclf by faying", that his objects coincided
â ' yvith those of the adminiftratio-i ; for if he
e _ is authorise], unsolicited, without the
ht knowl-dge, and, as he well knjw, againlt
ly the inclination of the Prtfiderit, thus kindfy
Â£ 'o fuÂ«ber the completion of his wishes in
n _ this instance, it would be equally proper
lÃj for him, on another occafi >n, to impede anal
t. ohllrud them : if he is csmpctent to fcnd
re an agent to France, for the purpose cf le
,r curing peace, he is no less empowered to ,
:â¢ "-'"d one to England m, order to create war. (
n No "'an who is acquainted with his cha- j
i- rader, doubts that he would embark in a !
s. scheme of the latter nature, with the fame 1
Â® readintfs as be has done in the former.
The people of the United States are call- \
h ed upon to reflcd seriously on this develope- '
r mcnt. It affords an insight into the vi\ws t
of their molt insidious loe, which he has %
been too crafty often to give them. They '
. are not now surely to be told that an illegal '
y aflumption of p wer is molt dangerous in its c
ultimate consequences, when halt injurious ! j
c in its immediate efFeds, and that while they t
may receive an apparent temporary benefit,, r
. precedent is eltablilliyed fur the ruin of their
tnoft efFential rights.
The next intelligence we received of Dr.
' Logan was, that immediately upon his ar-
rival at Paris, he made his way to the di- 0
, redory ; that the embargo laid upon cur F
vefTds was soon after taken off ; that orders
were given to the French pirates, no lon- Â£
1 ger to harrafs our commerte, wlun failing â¢'
. according to the decr>e6 of the diudory. J-
In the letter from himfclf published in i
i Saturday's Gaeette, we are informed that r
he it about to return to *his cout try with ,
' difpatche.-. for .-cue pjovefmnent calculateti v
to reftpre harmony between'thr t wo nations;
that a,l American vefl'tls were reltaled and ' *.

BALTIMORE, November 7. ]
To the Printers of the Federal Gaxete. \
Gentlemen, ,
I rcquelt yon to give publicity to the fol
lowing through the medium of your Ga
tette. On the 4th cf September, I was
captured in the snow Fanny, of Baltimore,
close in with the Spanish Main, by a French
privateer schooner, on board of which was j
a fellow of the name of John Mathers of
Baltimore, who told me, in order to cover (
his piratical condutt, that he only get- j
ting a paflage from Laguira to Curracoa ;
but I soon fotind out that he wds one of
the molt adive of the pirate's crew. He
perl'naHed the Captain of the privateer, that |
uitltTs he confined me and my men, we (
(hould rife upon him and retake the snow.
The Captain mentioned what he had told
him, and ordered mylelf and mate to be con
fined in (he cabin, and my men in the (leer- j
agf, where v/e were kept so clcfe, 11-at the j
heat had nearly deprived us of existence- (
When arrived at Curracoa, Matheri affum- (
ed great importance, and directed by his
information, another French privateer in
(lantly got under weigh, to cruse off La- .
guira, for the snow Maryland of Baltimore,
which fhexa| tured and brought into Cur- j
lacna. t
The above Mathers, Solomon Geer, and
<me Leacock, went out i rivateering on the
14th instant, in a French fchoaner of 10
guns. I was prefrnt when the two latter
wer.t on board, and heard them declare.
that every American thev captured, they
would drip even of their fliivts.
I wi(h every printer in the Union to pub- â¢
li(h the the above, in <-rder to acquaint the
Commanders of all v< (TtU belonging to the
United States, of the villainy of thofeja
tobins. t

rouTe their matters to w ath. How (hallow,
Hale, and unprofitable are all the devices of
jacubinifm. They know not even what fluff
; themfeives are made of.
The following fail, which we copy from
1 the European Magazine, merits serious at
tention.
, '' A celebrated lefturer in Natural Phi
-1 lofophy fays, that when he was in Virginia,
. he was told, that in a certain diftrift of that
. province, au epidemic ferer had been long
f used to prevail, and to attack mod of the
1 inhabitants of it, iu spite of every precau
tion that the medical men ' coÂ«ld suggest.
r Some Boftom'ans. however, coming to fet
c tie there, ( wliofe con fl ant custom in their
. own country is to wear flannel next to the
r fkinj, it was observed that they escaped the
, ! general infedtioÃ, which they imagined to
i I be owing to their method of cloathing them
. selves. The inhabitants took the hint, and
were never afterwards Aibied to their old
. disease."
Ft An English writer in just derision of the
| mock republicanism of the French, calls
i them republicanett.
'f'he immortal Milton in his anfvrer to the
Eikon Bafilike, of the unfortunate Charles,
thus fpraks of that unhappy monarch, and
his dilfrefTes : " To descant on the misfor
â  tunes of aperfon falling from fÂ« high a dig
. nity (who hath also paid his final debt both
to nature and to hi* faults) is neither of it
i felf a thing commendable, nor the intention
I of this discourse. Neither it fond am
[ bition, or the Â»ain desire to get a name,
: present or with posterity, by writing agaiirft
t a king."
â  I Milton was a republican. Far different
i is the temper of Gallic republicanism. After
i cruelly butchering the bed of monarch#,
r that bloody crew even to this hour, heap on
f his memory the molt vile and flanders.
, In this particular your French republican is
i nearly allied to the Jackal.
