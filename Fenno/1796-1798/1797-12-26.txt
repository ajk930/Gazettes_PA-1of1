In the firft flages of every rude and lavage fo

(1) an appeal to arms, a perfooal combat was
for a confideralilc time the only critenon by
which right and wrong was determined, or even
truth or talfehood eftablilbed or believed !
On similar ground-', for nÂ®ne other could ever

The jjleas of juftification which the modern

from the savage to the civilized state, not only
produced many evils, but tWe of the greatest
magnitude and importance to the society.
It has Â»n immediate aud inevitable tendency
to diminilh the national Revenue, when ( at the

MR.-FENNO, '
jThe following address is now circulating for
Subfcripticn ; and, it is hoped, will receive
the ftr'wus attention of the citizens of'Ph'da
delphia.
To the Select and Common Councils
of the City of Philadelphia.
The Address and Petition of the sub
scribers, Freeholders and Inhabitants of
the said City.
Fellow Citizens of the Corporation,
While the fufferings and distress of ifar
city, Qpcafioncd by the late contagious fiek
nefs, continue frefli in our memory ; whfld,
in-the (hort period of four years, we can
not ha\? wholly forgotten a former afflic
tion of the like kind, nor the Â»umber of
our deat friends, relatives, and neighbours"
whom we have" lament at the nnurnful
vi&ims of both visitations ; âand, finally,"
while we are devoutly to acknowledge that
kind Providenct which has fparcd Â©tir cJv/n
lives from the (hafts of mortality which ftcW
thick around ut, and hath restored our city
to its usual .state of health and prosperity,
we ought not to be unmindful of the means
which, under the fa>or of heaven, may ap
pear the melt effeftual, to prevent or miti
gate the return of the like calamities.
The chief magistrate of the common
wealth, in his address to the legislature,- af
ter a pathetic detail of some of the parti
culars, relating to the progress and extent
of the mortality, hath with a solicitude (uit
ed to the occasion, recommended certain
measures, as peculiar objects of legijlatlve at
tention aud provision, " in order to guard
more efFeÂ£tu3lly against the introduction of
pestilential and contagious difeaTes from
foreign countries ; founded on plans detailed
to him by the College of Physicians, by o
ther learned members of the faculty, and by
the Infpe&ors of the Health-office."
He has also proposed and recommended
Other remedies, absolutely necefTary ia co
operation with the legislative provision, Whe
ther the contagion be imparted from foreign
countries, or may be generated here ; and
chiefly, "An attention to the clcanlinefs of the
city, its avenues, and vacant lots, together with
the infuringfuch a supply of water, through
the medium of canals, as appears now to have
become ejfential to the general convcnienee, at
well as to the health of the community,'' both
in the city and its suburbs. Fof this end,
the exertion of tire corporate bodies, which
are constituted for the local purposes of the
city, the Northern Liberties and diftridt of
Southwark, with the extension of their pow
ers, as well as other legislative aid, are
pointed out as neceflaryJ
In this great Work, we trust the city cor
poration will consider it as their duty to take
the lead, not only as particularly interejled,
but as having the chief means iu their pow
er. For it seems demonstrable that the loss
to the city, in a fingli visitation of this con
tagious disease, (if it could be preventpd_<p.r
greatly allayed by cleanliness, and a copious
supply of water, not to mention the use of
water for preventing or subduing the devas
tations of fire, is more, perhaps, thai? ifie
capital neceflary to insure such a supply oÂ£
water in perpetuity, even if no interest ,werv
to accrue (on the capital to be expended)
for the use of water in families.
It appears from the statement in the gov
ernor's address, tkat even in the late fiekneft
the incidental orextra expences of the health
office, the legislative grant, and other contri
butions for the poor amounted to 42,000
dollars; and the loss arising from two ol- three
months fnfpenfion of our commerce, of ma
nufacturing- and mechanical bufincfs; the
expence ofthe multitude of families by which
near half the c!ty vvEscvscuateil, nottofpeak

* feÂ«v houses are consumed, and what might tl
be thiflols from a more extended fonfiagra- n

LONDON, Oft. 10.
Wethis morning lefume our extrafts from
the French paper*. The report of Ramel
couveys some idea of the state of the French
finances, when the grant of two hundred
millions in paper, was reduced, by the de
preciation of the credft of government, to
the vfdyu of less than nine millions in specie.
The French plenipotentiaries at Lisle, in
fending away Lord Malmediury for the
purpose of obtaining new powers to treat
definitively oq the basis of the total restitu
tion oronr conquests, made from France
and her aUicvwcre desirous to appear as if
they were not the fird to break off the ne
gociation. It nqw seems, that in order to
give fonae colour to that design, the plenipo
tentiaries are to remain at Lisle until the
16th ind. in expeftation of Lord Malmef
bary's return to that place, with the necessa
ry powers.
In eonftquenee of these proceedings,
Viek, the messenger, was dispatched to Lisle
soon after ( Malmeftjury return to Loo
don, to figflify tl>at thÂ« basis of the nego
i j) by waS such,
tfijjt.it could,not lead to an happy termi
nation. But the dlreftory (lillperfifling in the
delfgtf bPgfvTbg' i plausible air to its exor
bitant pretensions, sent Moufieur de la Clue
Wout' Wth a note, e'6ntaining in faft
demands as imperious as before, but glossed
terWis of grfat civility. Indeed**
trf it may be remarked as the
mod polite of any that has yet passed from
the French
"Lisle, 10 Vendemcare (08. S.J 6thyear.
" The plenipotentiaries of the French re
public, charged to' negociate peace with
England, have the honor to inform Lord
Malmefbury, that having addressed a copy
of 5 his lad note t>f Sept. 25, 1797, to their
government', the executive direftory has di
refted thfm to declare in its name, that it
has not Ceased to desire peace ; âthpt it gave
unequivocal proofs of the sentiment which
aftuati:d it, when it ordered theminiders of
the republic to demand a categorical expli
cation, with regard to the powers veded In
its minister plenipotentiary by the English
government; that such a proceeding neither
had, nor could have, any other objeft than
to bring the negociation to a speedy and
happy issue.
The order givan to tha miniders plenipo
tentiaries of the republic to remain at Lisle,
after Lord Malinelbury's departure, is a
farther proof that the direftory'defired, and
provided for, his return with foch powers
as would not be illusory ; and the limitation

The answer returned by our Cabinet has,
we have no doubt, been as polite, in point
1 offynn, as the note of the Direftory ; but
as the dignity and the interelt of the nation
unite iu refufmg our aequ'efctnce to the ex- v,
traordinary demands of the French frovern- tl
meut', it is highly improbable that the nego- v
ciation will be resumed for the present.
With refpeft to the sorrow expressed by w
the Direftory on the unfortnnate turn of the C
negociation, and its appeal to the powers of a
Europe, that to -the Engliftt-government p- J
lone is to be attributed the continuance of h
the war, they can only be confidercd ashy
pocritical pro'eft at ions, of which no person fc
can be the dupe, who diverts them of those I
illusive expreflions which the new republican I
adminiftratiort has fubftitiited for the Car- f
magnolesof the ancient committee of public a
fafety, the spirit and znimofity of which it i
has, however, preferred both izt the aftual t
and preceding megocktious. J sri 1

We learn by a letter from. Madrid,.iu- c
fcrted in the French papers, that the Prince f
j of Peace, who was comptomifed in the de
-1 elaration made by Dunan, has declared to f
j the French Arabaffador, that his Catholic 1
j Majedy has condantly rejedted all the infin-
I nations and propufals whidh have been milde c
to hiro, to engage him to break or.to violate j
the treaty which he had entered into with
the French government. He also made, a
protcftation of his own unlimited attachment
to that goveenment ; and adds, that every !
thing contained in Duncan's declaration is I
merely founded on fuppoliti'on and calumny. 1
What therefore are we to think of this con- I
fpiracy, under the ma(k of which the Di
tory has proceeded with such severity a- i

to its power, has no other foundation than
in the declaration of Duuan ?

The price demanded bjr u the Exeeutive

Smith, has been erroneogfly stated ; it was
not four hundred but four thousand men
that they have required. It is also untrue
that Sir Sidney is.on his parole ; he is Hill
in close confinement.
Our government, it is said, have declined
to purehafe the exahange of Sir Sidney
Smith at the price put upon his liberty, by
the Directory of France. It would certain
ly be edablifliing a veiy bad precedent to ac
cede to the unreasonable proposition of re

A Utter from Udina, dated September

late conferences.âlt is supposed that the
parties would not have been so discreet, pro

good and fatisfaftory intelligence. What
renders us dill more easy, is the sudden de

, LATEST FROM M.IJf
-1 The various and conlradid'jry Reports at-
I the Coffee-Houfe, on Saturday evening,
s are condensed into the following, which are
i direst from Capt. Peterfon.
t Captain Peterfon, of the brig Eliza, of
Philadelphia, arrived here on Saturday,
? from Bourdeaux, which place he left ou the
1 26th of Oftober, and the mouth of the ri
c ver tht firft of November.
9 On the 29th of October, he went on
r fiiore at a froalltown, called Royan, on the
. North fide of tie river, for the purpose of
c laying in bread for the voyage; at this place
he saw several French seamen, who had thai
- day arrived from the fleet at Bred, and were
i then embarking in a small vessel for Bour
!- deax. One of the sailors, who belonged
e to Royan, ftnd whose wife lived there, in
formed Capt. Peterfon, that the fleet at
y BREST WAS LAID UP, IN CONSEQUENCE OF
THEIR. NOT BEING ABLE TO MAN THEIR,
e ships; and, that the French Direftory had
1, issued a Proclamation offering their frigates
e to such merchants as thought proper to ac
d cept of them as privateers, they allowed go
s vernmetT? one-third of the priiie money,
e This datemeut, we thinkftoiay be depen

t son speaks the French language, appears to
1- be an intelligent man, ar.d was folicitons to
e be the bearet of NEWSâ[truly worthy im
itating.'] This is evinced from the circum
dance of his detaining his veflel several hour*
after he was ready to fail, for the arrival of
1 the Mail from Pars, which he did in cxpec
" | tation of receiving intelligence from tfoenee.
I Mr. Fenwitk, our Cons il at Bourdeax, told
s, f captain Peterfon that he did not think it
it j worth his while to wait longerâ-The Ca;jt.

which he replied,tha: lis kn- â¢â¢ n<*'t&iri "
than Captain P. did. and failed without e
ven an inclofiire from him.
The news of Admiral Duncan's vi&ory
was publilhed in France forne dayÃ before 1
Capt. P. failed.â A.t this event, it was faS4
at the Tontine, " the French took tnrltrsge.'/**

We have received by the brig Eliza, from
Bourdea'ux, a number of Paris prints down
to O<S. 25, but they contain not much itt
terefting news. The following is the fnb
ftance of the important articles :
A letter from Semlin mentions that the
disturbances increase in Turkey, and that
the rebel? threaten the capital of the Em
pire.
The Bafliaw of Belgrade has received
orders to restore to the fubje&s of the Em
peror all merchandize taken from them, on
occasion of certain disputes, demanding on-\

fhelterto the fubjeÂ£ts of 'the Enrperoi* 1 who'
may hare taken refuge in the Turkish terri
tories, and enjoined to treat the Germans,
in all circumstances, with diiliinSion.
A conclusion has been drawn from' these
orderfe, that a good understanding subsists
between the Ottoman and the two Imperial
courts.
News from UdiÂ»a to Sept. 18, relate*,
that the fufpeÃllon of arms between Gen-

New'difcontents arise in France. The
proposed law respecting the nobles is fevere
t. ly censured in furiae of,the gazettes, as un
, constitutional and ruinous to the creditor*
: of the nobles. At Bourdeaux, the direc

f entitled " The three Sultans, or Solyman
, II." The constituted authorities no soon
; er heard of it than they took severe mea
- Aires to prevent the reprtfentation of tile
piece, and the manager Latappy received a

the spirited conduct of the mayor and sun

MR. FENNO,
It is said that the Prcfident has difmifled
Tench Coxe Esq. from the office of Com
miflioner of the Revenue : This, to me Sir,
is most alarming aews ; not that I pretend
to judge of the propriety of the removal, for
well I know the constitution and laws of
our country have vested the President with
this unconditional authority j but I appre
hend a book must be written on thtfubjeft
juftifying the dismissed, and criminating the
government.
Mr. Randolph wrote a book vindicating
his resignation, price half a dollar.
Mr. Monroe, 6ecaufe he was informed
the government of the United. >st*tes hid ho
further need of his diple'matic exertions in
France, wrote a book, price one dollar and
' h s Â« â¢ -if â¢'"Â»'Â« Â«-Â«(â¢ â¦asli I 1
Mr. Coxe mufl, nndoubtedly wrilea book
and as the value, to keep up the proportion
must be found by multiplying the price of.
tbe last book by 3 hj'g, will be price
four and a half dollars.
But there is another still more terrifying
consideration ; Mr. Coxe's well known cir
cumlocutive talents threaten us with a book,
not much less than Cotton Mother's Mag
nalia, which contains acoo folio pages.â
Now, I beseech you Mr. Fenno, to beseech
the President to restore Mr. Coxe. I know
it may be saidÂ» and probably with truth,'
that neither M r - Munroe's book, nor Mr.
Coxe's ((Jiould he write one) will be read,
6ut, Sir, if we can prevent the latter from
being written, it will certainly save much
paper, and inkihed, and Mr. Bache's types
are so worn down by the tooth of time, and
by imprelfing so much scandal, that his
printing is fesreely legible now, and Ihould
he be driven to print a book fp tremendous
ly bulky, his types yill be ruined. Do
pray Mr.' Fenno- hint to the President that
the Democratic. Society,, of which Mr.
Blair M'Clenaohan trÂ»egn so remove
him from his office of PceCdeHt of,the Unit
ed States, if he wilfully periifts in not rc_
signing ; for he was advised in Mr. Bache's
paper, last summer, to resign, lefthefhould
if he continued in office, blunder on, and
dismiss sue good Democrat after another/
till the governmenu should have a chance to
be adminiftercd by its friends.âAoil fhduld
the Prefidcntbe removedâwhat a book will
he have to write ?

Citiven Campe-ias, Hydraulic Engineer,

ter to General Buonaparte- The author de

Chief of the Army of Italy.
" Citizen General, . .
" Your glorious campaigns, dire&ed by
the njsw government of the French republic,
have at Irngth spread the dawn of a general
peace over our continent.
â¢' The only enemy which retr.aias.ior yon
to combat, is feparafed from us by the sea.
Finish, in the wife manner in which you
have begun, the work of Â« continental peace j
and then come-arid rep-j'e vonrfelf a while
among us under yonr laurels. .You will be
hold with pleaftive the flourifhiilg I ft ate of
the arts, which you have' cherished from
your infancy; and of which yoti are a, well
beloved pupiL Your multiplied conquefta
have recovered them from that abyss into
which deftrilÂ£Mve war had ptijnaed the'nw
The art id who addreffrS you, filltd with the
Jnoft lively gratitude, wiD ere ft, if the
meansof execution be afforded him, a vast
ediSce, whenta, at the condufion of his k
b inrs, there will issue an aerial n ffel, ca
pable of carrying up with you irlure than
two hundred pe'rfens, and which may be
direÂ£k-d to any point of the compass. I -
myfelf will be your pilot. Yoif ean (hut,
without any danger, hover above the fleets
of enemies jealeus of our happiness, and
thunttar against thera like a new Jupiter,
merely by throwing perpendicularly down
wards fire brands made of a substance which '
will kindle only by the contaft and percus
sion at the end of its'fall, but which it will
be impossible toextiuguifh ;or perhaps you 1
may think it more prudent to begin at.once
by forcing the British cabinet to capitulate,
yhieh you may easily do, as you will have
it in your power to set fire to the city of
London, or to any of the maritime towns
of England. From the calculations I have
made, lam convinced, that, with this ma
chine, you may go from Paris to London, '
and return back again to Paris in twenty
four hoars, without descending.
" The period of th'is ehterprize, if my
humble vojee can be heard, is not far dis
tant. A single campaign would be fuffici*
ent to realise the whole of my plan. Deign,
then, to promote its execution by your cor
refpandence with the Executive Directory
of the French Republic, i have not yet
made any proposal to the Government, be
caiife it would require one million to caÂ»ry
through this projeft effeftually, and the ex
pences us the war have hitherto absorbed
the whole of the revenues of France.
" The objeft I propose is, to establish,
in the great ocean of the atmosphere, a ge
neral navigation, infinitely more certain and
more advantageous than maritimetiavigation
which has ever disturbed the tranquility of
mankindâto restore the perfefit liberty of
commerce, and to give peace and happiness
to all the nations of the universe, and unite
them as one family. By great labor I have
surmounted the multiplied obstacles which
presented themselves before me ; and my
progressive discoveries are developed in a
work which I have prepared, confiding of
about 400 pages, and divided into five
parts.
" I have (hewn my work to several learn
ed men of this capital. The commissioners
appointed to take my plan into considera
tion (two of whom are members of the na
tional institute, and formerly were members
of the academy) have long meditated upon
my data, which they have frequently ex
amined with the greatest attention : at last,
after a long series of conversations with me,
they have teftified their approbation in the
raoft unanimous and rnpft earnest manner.
" Every moment of your time, brave
general is occupied by your attention to
objects that are conducive to our happiness. 1
I cannot then, and ought not, considering
the distance between us, and fearing left my
letter (hould fall into perfidious hands,
cribe the whole of the long report that has
been made upon this fiibjc&. I (hall Am
ply present you with an extraft from the
last part, of it.
Extraa from the conclu/lon of the r<port.
'' Tn the fifth arid last part of the work
we find detail?, which the author had preser
ved of his firft experiments on Aerostation ;
and we learn that this artist had hitherto ex
perienced only disappointment; but it isob
vious that his combinations and his data ,
carry with them all the charatteriftics of
reason and - truth. â¢
" Welaftly proceeded to consider the ex-<
periments which the engineer Campenas has
lately made, with a view to thÂ« conftrudtion
of Aerostatic machines, and dire&ing them
to ufeful purposes. We are convinced with
him, as we have already observed, that the
larger the Aeioftatic machines are made,
the more easy will it be to direst themâ
becaufa they will present in the air less re
lative resistance in proportion to the num
ber of men they may carry, Sidconfequent
ly insure the progrefsof the direftion. In
deed, if we consider the united strength of
200 agairift the wind, and submit the pow
er of both to calculstion, it will be seen
that the force of the men will be seldom in
ferior to that of the wind. We are there
fore convinced, that it would be highly ad
vantageous to give citizen Campenas zeal
ous and faithful co-operators to aflift him in
the conftruÂ£lion of this machineâlf we con
sider attentively the immense treasures which
maritime navigation absorbs, there is no
thing extravagant in suggesting that three
or four millions might be laid out, if neces
sary, to |realife an attempt, the success of
which must add to the liappiÃefs of all the
nations of the globe.
" Besides, such an enterprize, if complete
ly fuccefsful, would afford a double advan
tage to the country. The building which
citizen Campenas purposes to establish, and
which may be conftrufted in the Champs-
Elyfees, would always present a monument
worthy of the republic. In it all the civic
fettivals might be celebrated, and all cere
monies performed which requfre great space
and of course cannot be exhibittd in bad
weather. This building is tbe Aerostatic
dock ; and ports and wharfs may be multi
plied in proportion as new vessels are con
' ftrudted. The advantages which a naviga
tion of this kind would infallibly produce,
are so amply demonstrated in the work of
citizen Campenas, that wf do not hesitate
; to recommend the prompt execution of his
plans."

During peace this buoy might serve to give
