cd THOMAS PAINE,
m- I have read your angry letter to George "VVafh
itigton, and cannot but confefs that appearances
arc somewhat againfl the General, and indeed the
iut whole American people, in having made no at
-3 tempt to rescue their old friend from tilt mercilels
clutches of the little J.icobin, Robespierre. But my
1( good fir, lam sure you will excuse us, when I in
ld form you, that our apathy 'to you, w 4l entirely
1 owing to our admiration of the glorions caufc in
which you were a&ing so itiuftrioÃs a part. Yes,
flr, to our enthusiastic admiration of gallic virtue
y and patriotism. I fee you are forprized. But have
a little patience. You mull know, (him, that in the
"excels of our zeal, we had adopted the maxim (fo>
hoirtd when applied to a despot, hut so charming
when applied- to the people) thill " the French i
could do no wrong," and of course tvery iÃflafure â 
th<*y took was faiifiified, as if coming from Heaven 1
itfelf. ' T Vox populi, Vox Dei," you know.
It is true, indeed, that during the eontells ofyÂ«ur ;
j patriots, we were alwjyi confoundedly muzzled to 1
find who was in the rijjht, 'till the gonlian knoc [ '
was cut by the guilietiwe ; and then, ir, all our
douhts vanished in an inflant. Hsnce tlis tremen- '
; dons instrument, which obtained so nany nick
names in Frauce, was literally the chopper of our :
logic> our unanswerable logician,- and iifaliidle cii- c
tenon of moral and political reftitude. '
lt Thus, for a long time, we were fimjle enough '
to foppofe that Louis the XVlth, thoigh a king, f
waÂ» a patriot. But his fad fate, at length, convinced c
us of our error. Briffot and his party Â«ext became a
j our idols ; but the guillotine, by takrHf off (in a
bout 30 minutes, I think it was, fir,) and '
1- twenty of these philefophical noddies 01 the revolu- a
ttonary Qjaixotes, transferred the palm of civifm to. 1
Robespierre and hisaffociates. And long did they
_ reign unrivalled in Â«ur affe&ions. Yes, "fir, in the '
very height of the " Age of Rreafsir," at the very *
time, as yau tc:l us, this sanguinary democ*at was *'
taking his viftims by hundreds in a night, cut Â»f
the Luxembourg, and guillotining them before the 1
next evening. At the very moment perhaps that lie F
was penning the sacrilegious memorandum, which 1
devoted you to the guillotine, " for the interest of
America as u .-11 as Fiauae," (as the fly rogue ex- v
prcfiei it) we were toafling him in our civic cups,
$ and crying him up as the paragon of patriots and *
republicans. Tis true, we heard of your deplora
ble cafe ; but we then thoii_jht you no better than
Briffot and the reft cfyour ariftocrafical colleagues,
and who the Devil could fnppofed, that you r
would at lall have out patrioted the author of your l '
imprifunmcnt, and have emerged, to. unite your
voice to that of the guillotine, to tell us what'a doÂ«
' he w-s ! 6 I
You make a terrible pothp about your being an
American citizen, your being a constitution-monger
in Fraace notwithstanding. But how in the name 0
of wÂ«nder were we to have fufpefled this, Mr. "
Paine, after the affair of G'deon Henfield ? If, how- c
ever, we have committed a mistake in the bus.ness,
you have to thank the new do&rine of expatriation "
for it. A defirine which has been very current
aTiroKg-Ã¼B-Â«iictrmc-inrre or urener-arra tnrWofetaiS r
Gideon. Upon this new fanglcd system, one never "
knows where to have you. You may be a citizen
of America to-day, a fubjeft of England to mor- 111
row, and a citizen of France Â®n the-day following. Â®
For as you have wifely observed of nations, that h:
they have only to will it to be free, and they are so;
so a man now a days, has only to will it to be a tc
citizen of any country he pleases, and he is one.
And after the brilliant fceues in which you were
engaged at Paris, we took it for granted, you will
ed to be a citizen of France, and ttiould have as
foott dreamt of your being an American citizen, as
of commodore Barney's being one, with his three
colour'd cockade, and cavalier menaces of taking m
our veflels wherever he can catch them. â¢
But though I have hitherto been in the apolo- ba
getieal (tile, I have a crow to pluck with yÂ«u, Mr. T
Paine, before I leave you. Don't yau think, then]
(though you are as equality man) that you have th
been rather rough with a character which Hands so all
high in the world as that of the Preiident of the llc
United States? If indeed you have the claims of In
private friendihip upon him, which yau fay yau lts
have, I have only to lament, that it is so, and that tr<
hers unfortunately in the predicament described in wi
the proverb, which fays : Â« He that olays with a a! 1
dog will be bitten by fleas." 'Tis an homely one, kl
Icon fefs ; but between republicans, 'twill do well tel
enough, and you are a dealer in proverbs and epi- 8Â°
grams. cr
You conclude your epistle with remarking, that th
Â« the world will be puzzled to decide, whether be th
(Gen. Washington) is an apostate or an impostor, re '
whether he has abandoned good principles or whe- tH
ther he ever had any." Sappofe before you put
your cafe, yÂ»u had ascertained what true liberty and ial
good principles are. From your known abilities, ki
do you not think it would have much assisted the
world in making their decision ? But though you
have not thought proper to do it, I have Â»a doubt,
that all good men will thir.k it a necessary enquiry, co
previous to a determination of your queflion. ln

SIR,
When we contemplate the near approach of your
retirement from public to private life, as announced
to yourfellnw-citizens, in your address of the 17th
of September last ; we- Ihould be wanting in duty
to our own feelings, and rhofc of our constituents,
if we did not cordially embrace thi* last occasion,
to join the grateful voice of the American Nation,
in the acknowledgment as your long services and
patriotic labors, in the atchievement ef our inde
pendence, and the eftablithment and maintenance of
our peace, liberty and fafety.
In the house where we now deliberate, eould we
be (ilent, its walls, if they had utterance would tef
tify for us that they beheld you seated in our fir ft
Congress, and, at their call, rising undaunted to lead
our infant armies to viftory or death, in the cat)fe
of iilieity and our country. They beheld you
again, after the issue of that perilous, but auspici
ous combat, seated in the fame house, and prefixing
eminently illoftrious, among the illuttrious band of
statesmen and patriots, who framed theprefent hap
, py conllitution of the Union.
We forbear, fir, a detail of your services, as well
before, as since, the commencement of the revoluti
on. Weic we adequate to the task, it would fall
more properly within the province of some future
hittorian, who cannot be fulpe&ed of personal af
fection, or public prejudice.
It is our present dnty only to express our grate
ful sense of your general fetvice"s. Prudent, firm
and magnanimous in war ; never despairing of the
public fafety in the word of times, nor elated by
success in the best ; confiding in, and confided by
youi> country, td lis great ell advantage ; glcurioufly
* relbquifhing your military charadter, when the
great national ptirpofes for which it was afiumed,
left yon at liberty to seek your beloved retirement ;
with equal glory, quitting that retirement, at
the call of your country to execute its councils and
commands in time of pemce-r-the faithful guardiah
and intelligent organ of its laws ; maintaining its
freedom, averting its honor and independence; and
at last, when in jour best judgment, without an
abatement of love for your country, you conceived
that the time was come, when you might be fafely
imltilgetj in a final return to that retirement which
your years and services meiited : then bequeathing
the fruits of your wisdom and experience in a fare
>,well address, the maxims and precepts of which,
we trult, will ever be regarded, as the richest legacy
of a father to hischildrenand latest posterity.
The fame ardent affeiiian whicb leads os, reluc
tantly, to acqu'efce in your approaching retirement,
commands nur fervent withesâthat you may enjoy
in this world the utmolt felicity of your heart, in
beholding the perpetual prosperity of our country,
under a fuceeflion of wife and virtuous statesmen
and rulers, animated by your example ; and that
when you are called from this woiltj, you may be
rewarded by th; unbounded tulieiiy ot the world to

Ihe following is extradted from a morning pa
per ; it is therein given as part of the speech of
Mr. Swatiwick, and shews the present opinion of
that gentleman, relative to the Welt Indies He
fays, " the Weft-Indies where all government was
retrograding into the state in which it flood an hun.
died years ago, .vhere all men were converted into
BiiccaneeiS) blacks and- whites, and all the interme
diate Ihndes ; where governors from France were no
sooner landed than they were rt fliippecl as live lum
ber and sent back again."
CONGRESS of the UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Thursday, January 19.
The Hook being in a coirmittec of the whole on
the fubjeft of furtiaer revenue, Mr. Dent in the
chair.
Mr. Swift fa id he had all along been opposed to
as} ftera of diieft taxation, believing it possible to '
raise the revenue wanted from indireft sources, and â¢
determined never to have Vecourfe to direst taxes,
unless the situation of the country was such as to 1
make it necessary to apply to that faurce. i
He should still have continued his opposition to 1
iirt& taxes, had it not been for information which y
he had received that the posture of foreign affair. 1
was such, as to threaten the cutting off of our '
sources of revenue arising from foreign commerce. 1
It was, not neceffaty to go into a confutation of 5
this matter. It was enough to fay, that there war
a probsbiii'y of a part, a very cenfidcrablc part of 1
f our revenues arising from commerce brtne; cut off- i
e U.iderthefe circuailtances it appeared necessary, to
have recourse to such taxes as were not within the
e power of foreign nations to annoy ; for this fÂ»ur
pofe, he believed it would be proper to enter upon
f afy item of direct taxes. It was necessary, at leatt
to begin to make the arrangements ; and, if not
ultimately requisite to be adopted, it might be laid
aside ; but he believed the situation of the country
r was such, as to make it proper for them to fettle a
i plan for laying a direst tax. Upon this principle
\\ only, had he changed his jpinion, and intended to
y vote for the resolution ; but he thought before the
~ lefolution was agreed to, it should be amended
, The refolutioit, as it then flood, he said, wrnt to
, the apportioning, " according to the last cei.fus,
j the following diredt taxes." He did not believe it
_ would be right to apportion a diredt tax according
f to the last census ; for when they attended to the
n|Cieafeof population ir. some Hates, and to the ttaâ¢ :
Â» tionary fitnation of others, no one would fa\ ihat
fucfi En apportionment would be right. In the
| Hates of Kliode Island, Gonmilicutt, Delaware,
] and New Jersey, there had been bus little increase;
â¢ in all the other Hates the increase had been greater,
j I hey ought theiefore to have recourse to a differ
ent mode. If they wcie to attend to the situation
r of two dates in particular the injuftioe would appear
t clear. In the last census, Connedtieutt was esti
mated to contain *40,000 inhabitants, and New-
York 340,000 Since that time, he said, the state
| of Comicdiicutt 'had increased very little, but the
state of New York, was increased at lcaft to 500,000
| so that Connefticutt had not more than 250,000,
â  wiiilft New York had double the number. In the
report of the Secretary of the Treasury, Connecti
cut! was apportioned 93,000 dollars of the
ted tax, and New York 140,000 ; the latter be
ing only about 40,000 dollars more than the form
er,, though it contained double the number of in
habitants. He would therefore, move to strike out
the words, " last census," and to insert, " accord
ing to their numbers."
He believed that no gentleman would deny the
justice of the amendment. Some objedtion, perhaps,
might be made against it on the ground of expence ;
but he believed he should be able to remove these
objections. Before the tax be laid, he said,
there must be a valuation of property, and when re
gulations were made for that purpafe, they might
alto be made for taking an enumeiation ofihe inha
bitants, in which cafe the expence wtmld only be
trifling, and therefore no objection could be urged
on that ground, and the justice of the measure was
evident, iiuee no gentleman could approve of any
plan whi.h fhuuld clu'ge two dates in the ratio of
14010 100, when their true ratio was as tyvo to
one. He hoped, therefore, the amendment would
be adopted ; and if so, he Ihould have no objection
to vote for the refohition.
r * wilhej the gentleman had not brought
forward his amendment in the present stage of the
butinefs, as it would prove a clog Hpon the discussion
ot the merits of the question, as all arguments must
now go merely to the propriety of adopting or re
jecting the amendment ; whereas, if the .â¢mend- I |
ment was withdrawn for the present, and, fTthe re
solution was carried, the amendment was introdu
ced 11. tl.e liuufc, the dilcuttion "would go oil Ull- '
embat rafled ; and if the lefolution was not ugreed
to, ir would be unncceffary that any amendment
should be then added to it. It had been said, that
a t xon laud was a reproach to a republican go
vernment ; ne wifhe.l an opportunity to be afforded
<>f P r o v ' n gi that a direct tax on land was more ccn
fonart to republican ttjan any Â«ther. He
hoped the gentleman would withdraw his motion.
Mr. Maoiion laid he thought the amendment a
proper one ; it went to generalize the piopofitioo,
by It 1 iking out the words prapofed, and u.-uld ren
dei i? appropriate to the time of the law going into
effett. If the tax were to be apportioned accord
ing to numbers, it must be accardjng to the num
bers as lati legally afcci-tained by cenfns. If no
new ce>.fus we e taken before the aft took place,
then the last must be the guide ; but if a new ceÂ»-
fus, then that must be the guide. For these rea
foiis, he was in favour of the amendment.
Mr. W. Smith enquired if this question had not
already been decided, by a motion made by the
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Christie.)
1 he Chairman laid it ia at in the house and not
in the committee of the whole that the former
(i ..vaToirtTaJtrt Â£ .r-bi~m S f,f'R>â¢ l ,rd, -
Mr. W. Smith said ' ke hÂ®ped the propofi.ion
would not be agreed to, bccaufe it would defeat
the Whole buliuefs ; and he would chufe, if it were
to be defeated, that it should be defeated dire&ly
and not indirefily. If it wcre the ob j eift of ' j
tlemen to take a new census, it would efTeaually
defeat the intention of the bill. He hoped there
fore, they should not waste their timeiin the pres
ent difcuffton, but determine the question whether
or not the principle fliould be agreed to.
Mr. Madison said he did not know to whom the
gentleman referred when he said there seemed to
be an intention of defeating the bill ; he could af
iure him it was not his inteotion. He wished to
Rive 1 lie proposition the fullelt discussion, that the
real disposition of the house might be known. The
amendment, he said, would not have the effeÂ£tihat
the gentleman supposed. If it was thfc intention of
the icgiuature to have a new census, it might be
taken in time ; but he did not believe a new census
would-be taken; and, if not, the apportionment
must be according to the last, because there would
be no other rule ; but, if there should be another
who would fay it ought not to be conformed to >
It it could be really supposed that there was an>
intention to defeat the original proposition by this
amendment, it certainly Would not have his nation
age.
Mr. Swift said he did not mean to embarrass the p
measure, but to facilitate it. He believed the ob- v
jedhon he wished to remove would make the refo- I '
ut:Â»n more agreeable to a great many member*! n
who would objeft to vote for it in its prefei.t form. '
W|]en the commit! ee of ways and means brought I
in a bill, they would make fnch legulatiops as they r
thought proper ; but if the refolmion were to be c
agr ".,. tG ln lts Fefert form, it would preclude all a
poi,.oi.i!y of having a new eenfus, if it should be 1
lound expedient.
1 I
f- | Mr Havens doubted whether tjic motion of tlir
a I gen:lcrsun from Connecticut wÂ»s ttcuniii
e j tucional. He read an extraft from the 30 fe&ioti
> ; of the lft article of the conltitution, in thefc words,
n i " The a&ual enumeration ftiall be made within
it thiee years after the firft meeting of the Congress
t ofthe United States, and within every subsequent
d term of ten years, in Â£uiih manner as they (hail by
y lawdireA and the 4th claufo of the 9th feftion
a of the fame article, "No capitation, or other direfl
e tax, (hall be bid, unlefsin proportion to the census
0 or enumeration herein before directed to be tak
e en." By these words, lie said he, understood, that
- direst taxes could not be levied, exeept according
Â» to a census to regulate the representation, which
> mull he rcken once in ten yeais.
t Mr S. Smith said this had 'ween deaided
J in the house and lie trulled it would again be re
c jedted. He recollected when the laÂ«t ceufus was ta
ken, it ivqs attended with eonfiderable difficulty,
t Maay ot the inhabitants in the country were Ger
- mans, and they were fufpieious that some bad pur
-1 pose was intended by the measure. In taking a
; new census, for the purpose of a rax they would
â¢ holdout to the people a temptation to return their
â  numbers less than they really were ; whereas, when
1 a census was taken for the purpose of ascertaining
the number of representatives to which they were
entitled, the people were interested te make thÂ»ir
â¢ numbers as Urge as poflible. Nor would it be pof
â¢ fible to get at th&fuil number of the people, whew
they were interested in withholding them. Indeed
> he fhoulcl not be surprised, if a census should be
> taken for the purpose proposed, if it proved less
than the former one. He gavÂ« his ditTent to the
proportion when is was before them in the house,
and he saw no reason far changing his opinion.
Mr. fiulland could hardly suppose the gentleman
from New-York (Mr. Havens) serious, when he
doubted the conftiiutionality of taking a new cer
fus. Great alterations mull certainly have taken
place in seven years ; and he doubted not many
would vote for the system of dire# taxes, if it coatd
be made tÂ® bear tolerably equal, but not otherwise.
Mr. Sewall said the amendment proposed, was
merely a verbal one ; for if a new census were to be
taken before the aÂ£t went into execution, the appoi
tionment mull be regulated by it, whether the words
were Itruck out or not ; and if a new one were not
taken, the apportionment mull be made by the
old census. It a census were to be taken, hi said,
it mult ba returned and approved by Congress, be
fore any tax could be apportioned by it. If re.
prefeniation and taxation were connected together,
he should have no objection to a new census
ta&eo ; but the term of the census not having ex
pired, if it was now nrcefTary to apportion a tax,
it mult be according to the Lft census. The *-
mendraent, however, being only veibul, it could
have no effeftou the refoluiion.
Mr. Nicholas said, ir he believed the amendment to
be of the very harmless nature which his colleague
( Mr. Madison) had fuppoled, he should noj have no
ticed it; but he believed it was or a more serious na
ture, is it would cause a dÂ«!ay which m ! ght ruin the
buiititis, as no tax could be-apportioned upSn a census
it had gone into operation with refpe<sl to fixing
the i.arr.ber of representatives. He believed they had
jjjÂ£-P QV ' er Â°* taking a census, bOt he thought it muff
TJe uTurrr me uoJcie purpole of tixafion ahdTxpr?- "
leiitaUiin, and not for taxation alone.
Mr. Gilbert fa id, there could be no question m,ore
txprefs and which would admit of less doubt, than that
representation and taxation mud go together The
cwniiuution diredlcd the cfnfus to betaken once in ten
year j, and when once taken, it aiuft remain to govern
until another was taken ; but whenever another cenfÂ«s
ihouid be taken, the lax mult be apportioned.by that. '
.lmw ceulus, he said, could not Operate upon a tax
now agreed upon. Whether a new census fticuld be â¢
taken brfure tne appointed time was a different cmefticn
and was not at that time before them.
faid, if the gentleman from Connec
ticut ( Mr. Swift) was sincere in his profefiions of not
wifliiag toembarrafi the propofitien before them, he
would withdraw Ins amendment; feecaufe, if it meant
any thing at all, it went at least to delay the business
It could not bÂ« denied that every dirtcf tax must be
apportioned acco lU ;Â« g to the last census taken accord- ,
IMÂ£ lO law ; and if the gentleman's motion meant that
the propoicd tax ftauld nut belaid until,a new cer.fus
was taken, it would neceffanly put off the bufiaefs for
fcveral years, ihe gentleman seemed to think that a
cenlus cesld be taken for this purpafe Â«mly , but, Mr.
b. latd, ;t he understood the constitution, 011 this f.ib-
J ' no direct tax could be apportioned but according
| to the census taken for the purpose of apportioning the
- If a new census was taken, therefore,
IT must operate If this opin.cn was just,
and he had no doubt of it, the motion went to the
puttmj off a diredt tax, until a new census fhou'd be
, taken. 1, this was not erabarraffing the business, he
did not uiiderhaud the meaning of the term. Hebe- ]
: IV 11 CC " wh ' Ch WaS take " was nst carried
into effect till two years afterwards, and if a new one
were taken, it would probably take as long a time to
bring it iÃteaaion, so that to carry the motion would
be in effea to put off the business for several Tears. <
he geutleii-an from Virginia (Mr.'Madison) tho't
a new census would not be taken before the direct tax
was aid; itfc, the motion was uf,-lefs. He hoped,
irH f ff e 'l Be Â° min WOuld w ' l hdraw his motion,
m tlie face im P orta,lt question fully
Mt. Cert said if direst taxes were to be laid, he was
not prepared to fay whether the old, or a new census
should be made use of; but, if the carrying ef the pre
lent motion would remove one of the objectionsXV
was agamftthe meafurt, he could fee no reason why
it ought not to pass. The refoluiion expreftly said the
apportionment should be according tâ the last census
the prefer.t motun went to leave that undecided, to be
determined hereafter whether the old or a new census
ftould regulate the apportianment: he hoped, there
fore, it would be adopted.
Mr. Madison said if he had forefeen that the amehd

31] Mr. Murray thought the debate an the present
s qneftion a very trilling one, as the abftiaA princi-
j 0 pie was neeeflarily kept out of fight. If the a

#t i>c made according to the last census, as a new tÂ«o*

ft iF the gentleman from Conne&icut saw that the
JS amendment would be us. iefs, he trufied he would
not infill upon its being 1 decided upon.
Jt Mi. lfaac Smith said, he though, they might get
