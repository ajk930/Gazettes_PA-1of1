FENNO,
A correspondent observes, that it is very'
Unbecoming in Mr. Deveze, a French sur
geon who was formerly employed as a phyfi
v cian in the hospital at Bulh-hill, to make
life of such an assuming authority in his let
ter tp Gov. Mifflin, published in the Auro
ra of thjw day, against all the measures
'that have been employed by our executive,
and by the inspeCtors of the health, in or
der to check the progress of the malignant
yellow fever. He may think as firmly as he
pleases that this dreadful disorder is not con
tagious nor imported ; but yet we have
learned men enough here whose opinions
ihould at leafl balance his own, in the mind
and judgment of our fellow-citizens. Mr.
DeVeze, who draws such an exaggerated
picture of those measures, does not fbrefee
how far the citizens will approve of them, ;
when they investigate why so few vittiras '
Were tkvoured by the malignant scourge,
Among those physicians who believe, that
the yellow fever is not a contagious malady, ,
there is not one but will be eandid enough
to acknowledge thit if it is an epidemic par
ticularly generated in this city and fuburba,
by the tffeCl W" any floating effluvias, no
'better preventative remains to our fellow
citizens who can afford it, than to keep off
for a short while, and to breathe the pure j
anti elaflic air of the countryâAdmitting
that the yellow fever ia not a contagious
disorder as the plague, the scurvy, the
small prtx, &c. it would be very difficult for
Mr. Deveze, and to any physician to prove
that it is not contagious in its last stage.
ChyrÂ»)ifU know how dangerous it is to be
in contact with animal putrefa&ion to a
certain degree, and physicians cannot deny
that even before their deaths, the sick with
the yellow fever are in a state of putrefac
tion. As.Mr. Deveze is not of the college
of physicians, we thinltit very improper that
lie fliould assert that the meafuÂ»es adopted
by the executive and by the iflfpeCtors of

of 5 or 6 physicians.

PARIS, July 8.
Ihe rumours which have been so iriduf
trioufly circulated, relative to the refutnp
tion of hostilities in Italy, may be reduced
to this : in consequence of the prelimihary
articles of peace, the French army evacuated
leveral of the Italian lutes, which the Au'f
trians progressively entered. In several pla
ces, however, the inhabitants, enraged at
the visit of the latter, took up arms, and
ma'de several discharges of mufquetry to op
pose tfleie entrance. Their resistance did
not last long. Thus, in spite of the jobbers
and fabricators of news, the .war i& not yet
recommenced
Lyons has not been declared in a state of
siege, as has been reported, but the direc
tory has charged the commandant of that
city to take such measures as the circumstan
ces may require.

The day before vefterday, at half past fix
in the evening, a fire broke out in the church
of the Celeftins in this city ; it burned till
midnight, and entirely consumed the build
ing- This church had for some years been
converted into a large manufactory for the
calling of balls, and for the construCtion of
,gun earriages. The engines succeeded in
cutting off all communication with the neigh
bouring houses. The fire is supposed to
have been the effitft of party maliceâthe
work of the royalifb and anarchists. One
of tijc spectators was of a different opinion :
â" it is not owing," said he, " to the
imprudence of the workmen, as has been
supposed', Divine Providence has lighted up
this fire ; Heaven,wearied with our victories
and the calamities of the world, has destroy
ed, in our arsenals, those newinftruments of
carnage which we ftijl fabricate with one

that the Auflrian troops are on the'point of

that the number of prifoneri employed in

of Ulm, encreafe daily, and they amounted,
at the date of the letter, to 6eoo. Fresh
orders were every d3y received from Vienna
to hasten the works. If the cabinet of Vf
enna were in expectation of an immediate
rupture, it could not employ more energy
in its defence. And how does it happen
that the French government, with so much
reason to mistrust others, continues in the

Paris journals of the 4th and sth inft.
are somewhat interesting. Tranquility at
present prevails in the French capital. The
two councils are chiefly occupied with the
priests, the houses belonging to their ci

Paris be tranquil, some of the southern de

of the most dreadful kind.

I.aft week immense quantities of stores
were shipped for the Cape of Good Hope.
A fliip of 800 tons was freighted with coals
and flour : the prime cost of the coals here
wa6 10001. and the- expense of carrying
them to the Cape will be 6rool. more. The
reason of/ending flour is, that though there
is plenty of wheat, thtre are not mills e
nough in the country to grind it for the
increased eftablilhment of the military and
others.
A petition has been presented to the Ba
tavian convention, by>a number of perfont

approaching negotiations, England may be
made to indemnify the Batavian citizens
for the loss tiey sustained by the detentfcjrf

We are glad to observe that the) bill in
troduced into ParliamentonTuufday by lord
Grenville, for enabling his Majesty to con
vene Parliament at a notice of 14 jnftead of

of the country. The regulation pan be at
tended with little or no inconvenience, as it
can rarely happen that a -member of Parlia
ment /hall not be informed of the circum
stance of the meeting at even the most distant
parts of the country within the limited time,
so as to be able to give his attendance on
the firft day of the frffion ; the advantages
resulting from the bill are obviojis, especially
in critical times like the present, where th&
collcftive wisdom of Parliament may from a
change of circumstances become highly ne
ceffaiy to be taken in the discussion of the
general (late of public affairs. The bill does
not, in other refpefts, appear to us to be a
ny indication of the opinion of his Majesty's
ministers on the probable success "oc failure
of the present negociation. It is aft of wife
regulation, and as such we have no doubt it
will pass ananimoufly in both houses of Par
liament.
As a prÂ»ofof the diminution in the gene

DEDHAM, (Majf.yAuguft 29.
Italy, formerly the mistress of the then
civilized world, hjs been uTstun and com
pletely reduced to fubjeftion, since June
1796. The efforts of her own inhabitants
for her defence have been Â»!moft nothing.
It was Austria, that fought against the in
vaders, and delayed the con que ft for a few
months. In a military view, the eyent
crowns the French with glory, and fills the
world with admiration.
But ftich ao event deserves more thought
and enquiry, than the firft wonder of the
news will suggest.
How happens it, that Italy, which falls
now like a child without resistance, once
was a giast ?, It is because antiently the
Roman discipline gave them the strength
of giants, andtheir enthusiasm fprtad among
the satÂ»wÂ«\the dread of them as devils. It
is bceatlfc Rciue divided Ly- 1.0 these
whom flic afterwards afiailed by her arms,
and by joining one state igamtf another, or
letting up party against party, within the
fame state, (he made her enemieg in effeÂ£t
conquer themselves - and at length under
the name of allies, she brought them all un.
der her own yoke.
Much national inflruftion results from
these events.'
Italy has negle&ed military discipline for
Tome 1 ages. Germany, it is has
at lead three soldiers to her one.
This kind of has been augment
ed by another. The faee of the map of Ita
ly is all befpattereii and blurred with the
names of petty principalities and Republics.
The number of the people in Italy is not
probably less than it was, when Rome trod
upon the neck of all nations. Her divisions
have made her weak. Had her force been
concentered into one state anddire&edbyone
authority, no invader could have conquered
her.
. Let Americans notice the precious value '

Some military knowledge and discipline.

3d. That of old as well as of late, the

courage and patriotism, wasto fowdivifioqi.
4th. It may be proper to notice, though
it is rather foreign to the design of these
observations, that the name of Republic ha*
not saved Genoa or Venice, thatSi neutrali
ty, which we know fear and weakness gua
ranteed, has not preserved the former from
exa&ionsânor the latter from revolution
pillage and subjugation.
And laftty, that the only fafety for ra
tions lies, not in turning quakers, and pro
claiming peace with all, nor in the fjdi'e pre
tensions of love and friendfliip na
tions, but in having at all times an adequate
force, and in shewing the spirit, that in the
last extremity would use it.

Some intelligence has finally been receiv

Nymph, of this port, who failed from Lan

the Spanish privateer schooner Joseph, Cap

and carried into a bye port on the island ot

privateer, and swore the veflel was from
New-Providence. Cipt. R. however writes,
that though the veflel had been robbed great

hoped to get the veflel clear, as he was now
treated with polite attentian and had an in.

A (hip from Philadelphia, bound to Bour

sir, *
THE American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, founded when their country was
struggling for Freedom and Independence,
which your exertions have so greatly tended
to e(labli(h, ask leave to offer you their con
gratulations on your election to the office of
firft magistrate, in a nation where the rights
of men are refpefted and truly supported.
They are led_to pay this tribute to your
virtue and merit, because you have for several
years presided over their institution witk
honor and advantage to thenv
Their pursuits are litdrary. They wifli
to add to the knowledge whic.h their coun
try already poffefles, and to use their cor
respondence with foreigners, engaged in the
fame pursuits, so as this valuable
purpose.
They cannot, however, be indifferent to
the peace and happiness of the land in which
they live, nor to the preservation of those
invaluable conftitutionsof government, which
distinguish it from all other nations. They
kpow that these coiiftitutions will not arifWer
the important purposes f<sr which they were
formed, unless they are well
With pleasure they find their Prelidtut,
whom they have so long known, and so high
ly efteersed, called by the free fu.frages of
his to she arduous tafli ef
guiding the counsels, preserving the honor,
and supporting the prosperity of the United
States, in fucceffiort to the man whose dis
tinguished integrity, anr' disinterested patri
otism, his fellow-citizens have so universally
attested. Their aid in accomplifhlng (hefc
defifable purposes, cannot be greatly effective"
âbut you may be aflurfcd that influ
ence v/ill always be exerted to promote the
measures of a government founded on tht
basis of true liberty, and a/fminifttred with
wisdom and firmnefs, They feel high fa
tisfaftion when they find these virtues "mark,

adopted ; and they ardently pray that the
infinite source of light, and of power, may
always'direct you, and siowr with fucctf#, yolir"biTprtS to promote the welfais of your

THE ANSWER.
To the American Academy of Arts & Sciences.
GEJqLEMEN,
MEETING with yon at a regular period
established by law, lexpc&ed nothing mo're
tlian those habitual expressions of yourfriend
fhip, which I have constantly received, as
One of your iffociates, upon all such occa
fiobi. This elegant address, therefore, as
it was lyit fovefeen, is the more acceptable.
Coming from gentlemen whose fame for
science and literature, as well as for every
civil and political virtue, is not qonfined to
n lingle state nor to oije quarter of the world,
it does'me great honor. Your congratula
tion on my eleftion to the office of firft
Magistrate, in a nation where the rights of
men are refpe&ed and truly supported, de
serve my best thanks.
The commands of the public,, have obli
ged me to relide in foreign countries and
diflant states, for afmoft whole period
of the exiftince ,of our Academy ; but no
part of my time has ever been fpept with
more real fatisfa&ion to myfelf, than the few
hours, which the course of events has per
mitted me to pass in your society.
Your exertions at home, and extensive
correfpondencids abroad, are, every day, ad
ding to tha knowledge of our country, and
its impHÃvement in ufeful artsâand,! have
only to regret that indifpe.i fable avocations
have prevented me from assisting in vour la
bors and endeavoring to (hare in the glory of
your' success.
The unanimity with which the members
of this academy, as well as of the university*
at CamVndge, and the whole body of the
clergy of this common wealth, (all so hap
pily connected together) are attached to
the union ftf our American dates, their con
ftitutioins of government and the federal ad
ministration, is thehappieft ome-n of Uie fu
ture peace, liberty, fafety and profpertty of
our country. The rifing 1 generation of A
mericans, the mod, prom'ling and perhaps
ihe moil important youth, which the human
species can boast, educated in such princi
ples and under such examples, cannot fail to
answer the high expectations which the
world has formed of their future wisdom,
virtues and energies.
To succeed, in the admin iflration of the
government of the United States, after a
citizen, whose great talents, indefatigable
exertions, and diCnterefted patriotism, had
tarried the gratitude of his country and the
applause of the world to the highest pitch,
was indeed an arduous enterprize. It was
not without much diffidence, and many anx
ious appreh#rifions that I engaged in the
service. But it has been with inexpressible
gratitude and pleasure, that I have every
found, in my fellow-citizens, an al
most universal disposition to alleviate the
burthen as much as pofiib'le, by the cheerful
and generous support of their affeflionate
countenance and cordial approbation. No
thing of the kind has more tenderly touched
me, than the explicit fanftion you have been
pleased to express of the measures I have
hitherto adopted.
Permit me, gentlemen, to join in your
fervent prayers, that the incomprehensible
fource'of light and of power, may direst
us all, and crown with success, all our ef
forts to promote the welfare of our 'coun-
I try and the happiness of mankind.

Extract of a letterfrom London, June 5.
" Th< Adminiftrition here has received a
letter written by Mr. Morris, who fays he
â¢was at St. Domingo, and in the confidence
of Santhonax. That Santhor.ax hired a
number of persons to go into the United
States, and set fire to the populous towns.
That some had returned, received their re
ward, and had gone thence again. The
writer mentions their names. One of the
Ministry has furnifhed Mr. King a copy of
the letter."
If the circumstance of the acceflion of
Paul I. of Rufiia, to the confederacy against
France, and the infoiVnation of the account
thereof being received fourteen hours Sfter
the signing of the cefiation at Leoben; are
accurate, they afford one of the mod extraor
dinary occurrences evt/r recorded in history.
âExtraordinary as it appears, we thing it
fadl:âfor independent of the account of it,
ijferted this day, we have seen a Paris pa
per of a late date, in which it is pleasantly
said, " succours, offered by the Emperor of
Ruflia, to his brother of Germany, coming
as |hey did, after the treaty was signed, is
likp mustard after dinner."
Capt. Daniel Tilton, of Exeter New-
Hampshire, is appointed Senior Officer of
Marines for the frigate Constitution, where
of Samuel Nicholfon, Efq; is Captain and
Commander.
We learn that a supply of cloathing for
the Marines will be sent on, as early as pos
sible. It is said to be preparing. Re
cruiting inftru&ions, and money will be found
as soon as it is ascertained whether Capt.
Tilton accepts.
OF PEACEârrs PROSPECTS.
-PARIS, July 8 to 12.
Negotisttions with the emperor continue.
The new preliminaries have been signed at
Bade between the republic and emperor.
Lord Malmefbury certainly arrived at
Lisle, the 6th infl. at 6 o'clock, P. M.
He has visited the French legation.
In the appointment of* our negotiators,
Barthelemy has not had all the influence
â which was expe&ed : it has not been his
fault, for it appears certain, that he has
displayed a firmnefs and franknefs which
juftify the hopes that have beep conceived
of him. He voted neither for' Letourneur
nor Pleville.' He proprtfed thr.ee men who
'would have been generally approved by
publicâBourgoing, formerly ambafla
dor of France, at Madrid, the author of
an etfcell nt tour of that country, and who
been employed 3o yenrs in diplomacy :
: Maret, who has been adopted ; and Col
chen, for whom he could; obtain no other
appointment than that of secretary general.
We are aiTured that Barthelemy declared
he could not vote for Letourneur, vrhom
he did not know, and place him at the head
of an employment which was altogether
new to him. He was strongly supported
by Barras, who <4fo urged the inconveni
ence of a choice. The partiality,
however, of -the other three members for
old colleague, got the better of the
powerful reasons of Barthelemy and Barras,
who were in favour of diplomatic men of
known merit.
! July 6.
One journal Only announced yeftarday
that hostilities were re-commenced ; many
journals repeat it to day. It is difficult to
believe this news, and the least reflection is
fufficient to rejedt it entirely. How can
we think the emperor has begun to fight
again, after having aided in despoiling the
Venetians, Hiid after having himfelf appriz
ed the powers around him, that nothing is
more lawful 1 than to pofTefs orte's felf of the
eftatcs of the unfortunate i If the emperor
(hould be beaten, would not the Grand
Turk, the king of Prussia, and the empe
ror of Russia, in their turn, have a right
to aid the French republic in partitioning
his eflates ?
July 7.
The news of the renewal of hoflilities
with the emperor is noj confirmed ; and yet s
for some days, public paper has been very
low ; yesterday it had, no fixed value ; it
was offered at all prices, without finding any
piH-chafers. Some fufprft the directory
have made additions to its firft propositions ;
others think the emperar is frightened at
the revolutionary principles \*hich agitate
Italy ; but those piinciples are not to be
reprefTed by force of arms, but by a fccu
rity of the smaller powers againfl his arilbi
tion, and that the emperor is no longer
there.âEurope this day pays for its cow
ardice in fuffering the partition of Poland ;
in- that .partition was written the downfall
of the coalition.
July 9.
The following is the amount of all the
reports refpefting the re-commencement of
hostilities in Italy :
In confetjuence of the preliminaries of
peace, the French army had evacuated-fe
veral parts of Italy, to which the Auftrians
returned : but the inhabitants of several
places doubtless but little flattered by the
visit of the took arms and fired upon
the soldiers to prevent their entry. Their
refiftanee however did not continue long.
Thus in spite of all newsmongers and flock
jobbers, war will not break out again.
Bourdeaux. We have reports of admiral
Jervis's bombarding Cadiz. '
OF GENOA
June 26.âLetters from Genoa afTure us,
thata.great part of the inhabitants of that
republic have it in contemplation to ask for
the reunion of their country with France.-
If this could be effe&ed, the states ot Ge
noa would form one of the finetl departments
of France.
July 4.âWhile the government journal
would persuade us, that Gen. Buonaparte
and the French republic have not operated
the revolutionary movements of Genoa, the
provifipnal government of that provisional
democracy thank Gen. B. and the French
Republic for having officially co-operated
in the regeneration of the country.
OF MALTA.
If we may credit letters from Malta, pub
lished in the Frankfort journal, a very exten
sive conspiracy has just been discovered, in
which a great number of persons of all con
ditions are implicated. The plan of the
conspirators was, it is said, to assassinate the
Grand Master and the Commanders, and to
substitute a democracy instead of the prcfeftt
government. This conspiracy was to have
broke out the fame day with that of Genoa.
Happily it was discovered in time, and seri
ous measures havs been taken to ftifle it en
tirely. A great number of individuals have
been arrested, and a tribunal has been estab
lished, composed of (four bailiffs to judge
tljem. " This revolutionary spirit" adds
the Journalist on this fubjeft, " which has
already delivered up a great part of Italy to
innovations, ieems ready to propagate itflf
through every part of that fine country, and
to cause a general flame. Letters from Na
ples fay that a fermentation reigns there,the
consequences of which are dreaded. -It is
the fame in the states which the
war has spared : and it is feared that a va
cancy in the holy fee, if it is unhappily tak
en place, will give rife to ferieus troubles.
Even Switzerland appears not to be entire
ly Jheltered from the contagion ; we have
already heard of troubles in that part of the
republic nearest to Italy, as well as in the
canton of fit. Gall. On the other hand,
the harmony, which has reigned between
France and the Helvetic League has been
disturbed by some incidents, and among o
thers, by the d'fpute which has taken place
on the fubjeÂ£t of the navigation of the Lake
of Lugano, and this affair is far from being
entirely fettleil."
OF VENICE.
Terms of peace allolued by Gen. Buonaparte to
the Venetian Republic.
A million and a half of ducats (3 millon'
of dollars) in ready money.' 2d. Support
ing the French army until he pleads to with

(or 6 million of dollars) in marine objÂ£&s,
such as wood, cordage, cannon, See. jth.

We learn with aflo>iifhment, that besides
the heavy contributions which we are forc

claims upon the produftion of the arts.

are told, in the evening of tha 12th inft.
being about 3 leagues S. of Seguin, he dis
covered a schooner of about 120 tons, ap
pearing to have an uncommonly large light
on board. Finding the light to increase,
the Fisherman drew nearer, in order if ppffi- '
ble to afford afTiftance. As he approached
the main mast of the schooner fell. There

Quito, 6th February, 1797.
SÂ»nie account" of the dreadful effe&s of the Earth
quake at Qaito and its neighborhood, on the 4th
| inllant. 1
The dreadfu\ calamity began at Quito, at half
pad 7, a. m. and laded, from the bell calculation
upwards of three minutes. The elegant college
of St. Fernando is in ruins The large edifice of
Santa Domingo is confidarably damaged; the grand
tower was broke into many pieces, and a number
of the cells entirely dedroyed ; the fludent's school
is in ruins. The ' igh church of Del Carmen, one
of the most elegant frbrics in this place, is t&tajly
demoliâ ! ed. The tower of La Merced is nearly
in the fame date ; it has been ordered to be pulled
down. The church de la conception has fufÃred
considerable damage ; indeed all the bed 1 uilding*
of the place are dedroyed. None of the low
6uildingshave received any damage.
At Facunga the b-gan fom- time pad

tinued until ao'cleek, p m leaving the village en
tirely in ruiiW, not a building being lift danding,
except an arch in the great square, and a part of a
neighboring house.
The people who hive perilled.are innumerable j
the churches of St. Santo Domineo, and
La Maerced, were crowded with people hearing
mals, not one Â«f whom were saved. The whole
place opened inte sullies, out of which lÂ»ige quan
tities of water issued. Don Francifeo ( amacho
was swallowed up, and no account hasbeen re
ceived of Don Antonio Texado, who was with
him v
The village of St. Philip, which is near to Fa
cunga, is swallowed up : in this place ihere was a
fcl'ool with upwards of forty children who have
iuff -recl the some f it*. ââ  t -
There are diflitrmt reportÂ® refpe&ing the village
of Anbato ; it isfaid to be iTkewife in ruins.
The famous edate of Marquis de Mirafl: res, on

, CAUTION.
WHEREAS a combination of men in thai
county have undertaken to enrich thÂ«m
---t felveÂ»,hy fabricating titles tofundr/ valuable tra&a
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New
York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which
trails of hnd large sums of money have been plid
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers â¢
It is therefore just that public information (hotild
be given, to the end, that the injured may feekre
drefs while the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have been discovered are Tru
nin Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re

several other! who go under fiÂ£Ht:ous names. It ia
supposed that the lands offered fcr salÂ« on these fa

âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as 'Well to caution the
public against purchasing those lauia, as also to de
prive those men in future from imposing on indivi- 1
duals, which their education and address have en- I
abled thtm to do heretofore. Witcomb has been

Otfego, July 18th, 1797.
I Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Wit emb and
Truman Harrifon, of tha fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, which
was the property of William T. Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others; snd further the said Joseph
and Truman did persuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made cut 011 the ic th day
of November, 1793, or let back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the nam* of
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fictitious name,
there being no fact perlcn there. To this I make
