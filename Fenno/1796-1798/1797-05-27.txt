The rrpublicanifm of our exclusive patriots
has often been displayed in their denuncia
tions of the proceedings of our governmentâ
Tiicy profefj to be friends to a representative
government âto the rights of eleftionâand
on particular occafion3 cry up the infallibility
of the majority, and represent it as a damna
ble political heiefy tÂ» rcfilt their decifiuns.
Bu', not content with giving the lie to their
profefllons by general abuse of the proceed
ings of government for years together, when,
ever they are defeated in a particular objeft,
by either.of the btanchts of the legislature,
they ate so it,cautious as immediately to show
their cloven foot, and all their deference for
the majority of the democratical blanch is
converted into billingfgdte.
Thua, " a majority of the House of Re
prefcntati.es were (ligmatized as a rancorous
faShn merely because they" exercised their
own judgment in the choice of a clerk.â
Very few of the idfcaS fuggsrteJ by this de
tellable faftion were ever adopted by a ma
jarity of either branch of the government,
and they may fafely' be challenged to point
out a (ingle article that has teceired the legis

bated. 1 hefe refleflions are founded on faÂ£ls t

The public good men oft ptetend,
Whilst private intercfl is their end.

other nations; solicitous only for the maintenance
of order and justice, and the preservation of li

on the strong ground of integrity to be affedled by

" Then -went Sampson tÂ» Gaza, and saw
there an hnrkt."
Strong as he was, fueh a journey debili
tated him. It was not the length of the
way from Timnah ; it was not the rugged
roa'l, nor the irkfomnefs ot a hard trotting
mule ; it was not a stroke of the fun, nor
a bleak air that (hook the nerves, and proflra
ted the life of Sampson ; far not one of these
circumflances is ever glanced at by the histo
rian ; no* he saw, in one of the flews of
tiaza, a venal beauty and was undone. His
wit evapoiated, his wisdom turned babbler,
he loft his vigilance, his eyes, and his life.
One licentious indulgence excites to a
nother. The blandiihments of this courte
z.m to the cells of the whole fillerhood.
He lays his h<ad in the lap of voluptuouf
nef6, and gives full scope to criminal deOre.
For it came to pass afterwards, that he loved
a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name
was Delilah.
Let us pondera little the hiftoryof these
unlucky amours. A (ketch of the wars and
viciflltudes of passion is of more interelt than
the narrative of a battle or siege, or the ar
nals of an empire.
To display a striking, ss well as ufeful
contrail, it may be correft to view Samp
son, before he entered the gates of Gaza,
and after his acquaintance with two bad wo
men.
His fir ft was by no means a love adventure.
It was in the style ofchivalry without a dam
sel. Lurking in the vines of rude territory,
a lion roared against our juvenile hero, who,
as it is in a lively manner exprefled, rent his
ferocious adveifary, as he would have rent &
kid. A bold encounter, but not half so
dangerous as the smiles of the lady in the
valley of Sorek. Mere brute farce, however,
was not the sole attribute of Sampson. For
seven days he tortures the ingenuity of thirty
friends to resolve an enigma. He .had the
palm df wit and the chaplets of vitlory ; by
his art he destroys the property, and by his
arm the life of his enemies. Not only the
family of his father, Manoah, but the whole
circumjacent region must have rung with the
praises of this ytjuth of promise ; and even
indifferent men, and abllratt reasons would
alertly from such imptfing premises draw the
happicft conclusion.
But behold how, in one hour, so great
riches come to nought. TÂ» is far, what a
tissue of brilliant atchievments do we admire !
The next scene is madly mortifying. In
the very summer of the ensuing page ef his
story what are the humiliating particulars of
hfÂ« downfall ? Sampson, the valiant, the witty,
and the wife, is the dupe of fÂ«male jugglers ;
is enticed ; is overcome. In the zrms of a
" twining Lais" of the Philistines, his fu
pernalural llrength melts away. He awakes
out of his lethargy of pleasure, and hopes to
go cut, as at other times, rejoicing ia his
might. But the energy of the foul is no
more. He, whom once nothing could re
fliain, is bound. He gauds in the prison
houlv, and, dwindled into* buffoon, is in
â¢wjtfd <wilh his m*tley to a/nufe the rabble.
In the life of this extraordinary pei fonage
it is.amatterof regretful Speculation that the
field of honor (hould be changed for the vally
of Sorek. Hence an abundant crop of
evil. It was not the Phili!lines, it was im
pure prffion that extinguilhed the difcern
mervt of Sampson. He never fÂ»w any ob
jetJ clearly, after he went to Gaza, and saw
an harlot. It is true, he f.-w Delilah, but,
probably, through the obfeurity of noctur
nal hours. Of her arts, of her perils, he
furcly had but an imperfeft vision. Hcad-
j/ink-'d by pleafnre, he could hot fee the
seven locks oi hit head, featured on the toilet
of a worn in, The fc'fl'ataof a gypfey-proved
(harper than the fwoid.of enemies; and the
flowing hair of the hero, once covered, with
laurel, is now tortured into meretricious
ringlets, or periwigs fo.r.e pimp in Delilah's
anticliamber.
Gei.ius, said the amiable clergyman, with
whom I studied divinity, is invariably con
ne&ed with Strong paflions. When men,
exquisitely organized, indulge pleal'ure, it is
with that species of fervour, noted in.the oriÂ«
ental pageâit is with all their Inarm. and
with all their foul, and with all their Strength,
and with all their mind. The icfenlible
lonngcr, the felf cngrofTcd coxcomb, may
deep upon the knees of IXhlah, and v.vke a
gain to puny life. But of that opiate of joy,
of that golden cup of abomination, which
the harlot presents, if you iip, man, of feel
ing, you will " drain the chalice to the lpw
ell and fouled dregs." Keep the bigh and
â fafe ground ; âbeware ol Hiding down the
dope of pleafure-. It conduits you to some
vale of Sorek, beneath whose roses are the
Serpent and the dagger. Go up to Parnassus
and fee the museâAn excursion to Gaza to
fee a mortal beauty, is not half so exhilarat

FRENCH INFLUENCEâNo. V.,
MR. RUSSFI.L,
THEttE has been a period, when Gallic in
fluence and Gallic principles were at the sum
mit of their glory in this country; a period,
when the voice of the genius of America was
fcarce'y heard, and when the suggestions of true
patriotilna, and national dignity were either not
Jiltened to, or del'pifed.. At that awful cri&s,
the scales of empire were suspended, and to the
eye of philosophic prophacyt it was not even
problematical, it was highly probable, that A
merica would be reduced into thefcalesof France,
and become the humble fnpplicant, the willing
(lave of the despots who rule that nation with an
iron red. Thai period so interesting to the for
tunes of America, and which posterity will look
back to with horror, was during the mad ca
reer of the seditious, inflammatory Genet. In
vain would Genet have continued to dispense
with a liberal and judicious hand, the louis d'ors
and the crowns of France, (unless his.refourees
had been as exhauftlefs as the mines of Peru)
in vain would he kave secured by carefTes and
flatter), the vain and the ambitious of our na
tion ; in vain would he have dispersed his in
flamatory and seditious writings through the
medium ef venal and prostituted prefles, the
great body of the yeomany like a firm phalanx,
woul A have fiood in battle array, ready to meet,
and determined to check the progress of any
daring invaders of our internal or externa! re
pose.âGenet, eagle. eyed to discover the bar
riers which opposed his success, and resolved to
accomplith his objefl, even if the road to it led
to civil war, and infurreiflion, introduced into
the peaceful city of Philadelphia, hitberto fam
ed fÂ®r its order, that bane.ofall regular govern
ment, a jacobin club.
In what manner the firft promoters of this
pious, cmjlitutional and patriotic fecietv, were
induced to encourage, to fofter, and to support
it ; whether by gold, or purchase of flour, will
probably remain a secret. We cannot extend
to them, the candor which we would exsrcile
towards their less informed followers, that they
were not aware of the wrongs and injuries they
were committing upon their country.
Though Mr. Swanwick, Mr. Clenagain,
Baclie, and a long lift of miserable tools nUy
plead that they were duped, yet this excuse will
not prefsrve the memory at the fcientific Rit
tenhoufe, the amiable Hutchinfon, and the
learned Sergeant, from merited contempt.
As to Mr. secretary Dallas, I presume he
wilhes for no apology ; he glories in the honor
of having beenforemoft in the cause of ittfur
reiSion, and ardently wilhes for another oppor
tunity of exercising his talents. The establish
ment of the parent club at Philadelphia paved
the way for the creation of them in other popu
lous towns in the United States. Charleston,
Baltimore, Pittsburgh, New-York, Bennington,
Boflon, Portfraouth and Portland, soon follow
ed the patriotic example.
Four or five leading charaflers in each place,
men of characters and principles well adapted
for the cause of sedition, were all of whom Mr.
Genet had bccafion to secure, and barren indeed
mud be that foil which will not yield a few Ar
nolds, a few Dallases, and a few Livingftons.
The society once established, no great pains are
neceflary to create members or to excite them
to violent measures. Novelty, fondnefs for
change, vanity, discontent, ambitien all operate
as po verful recruitiug-oflicers, to fill up the
ranks of affiliating clubs. "Today, lam noth
ing, I am only one of the people; to-morrow I
(hall be fometbing, I (hall be a member of a club,
a club too to govern, watch, and controul my
fer-vmnts, the public agents," is very natural, ve
ry powerful, and we have seen, in this country,
irresistible language.
The .ivowed objefls of these aflociations were
to promote the circulation of ufefulinformation,
to guard the cause of liberty which was endan
gered by the European combination, and to
watch the condufl of our own administration,
in which they pretended to have observed cer
tain departures, from the spirit of theconflitu
tioo, and around which they esteemed it the dur
tyof all " good citizens to rally." The real
objefls of these clubs, were, to aceuftom our
citizens to the newfangled doctrines of the
French jaccbins ; to familiarize them to the
jargon of unmeaning words uttered with holy
zeal, and the disorganizing principles of the
republicans of France ; to call up all the old
resentments agiinft Great Biitain; and (timu
late us t* take an aflive part in the war with
Franc#.
They accorlingly publilhedtheirconftitutions
and regulation!, written in a cc el, crafty and
artful (tyle, calculated to entrap the unwary and
honest citizen. But soon ifterthey were organ
ized, they threw off the maflc and came forth
as the bold champions of French principles, and
of open infurreilion. Tbey publilhed their
votes and anathemas, as dogmatical and as ridi
culous a; papal bulls, against every important
meafureof the federal government. They re
probated in express terms, aÂ«sls of congrcfs
which had been Solemnly past, and had been in
operation for yejrs. The funding, system, the
revenue laws, the excise ails, the President's
proclamation for neutrality, the appointment of
Mr. jay by the President and folate, all met
with severe and unwarrantable ceniure. The
people were excited to interellthemfelves against
these measures, and to execrate the men who
had promoted them.âln short from one de
gree of violence, they proceeded to another, un
til they received, what to every ingenious mind
would be the fevered piiniQimeat, the open and
avowed reprimand of the candid, prudent, en
lightened, good and immortal Washington.
In any other country, the leaders would have re
ceived the punishment of traitors. The event
will be hereafter detailed. LEONID/IS.

SIR,
VVE, the officers and soldiers and other free

vlfll'i and major Tayl<* 's battalion?, deeply im
prefied with ihe importance of the exiliir.g cri
sisâconceiving that it would be agreeable ti>
you, their, reprefentati:e, to be armed with
their opinions on the interesting ocrafion, and
not from any Want of confidence in yaur fideli
ty to us, or attachment Vo our cointnon coun
try ; takethe liberty to declare, that the coo-'
venirv; of Congrcfs at .this unefual time, has
a tendency to increase in our minds that lolici
tude which the ynprovoked depredations com
mitted by the republic of France on our e6m
merce, and the dilpofitioti manifested by them
to complain of the American government had
before excited. We ronfider it as portending
an inter: option to that tranquility which the jus
tice and wisdom of the American councils seem
ed calculated to perpetuate, and indicative of
war with that nation, which it hath been among
our chief glories to consider oÂ»r ally j not up
on the fordid principles which ton commonly u
nite nations, but upon those alike honorable and
beneficial to both republics, having for their ob
jedl no less than the happiness of the human
race. A continuation of these sentiments, it is
dill our anxious with to maintain and prcfcrvc,
and when we refledl upon t/ie a-vovjed princi
ples of the French naiioh, we cannot entirely
abandon the pleasing thought of a return of that
confidence and harmony which may have been
interrupted by the machinations of some, who
under the specious garb of excelfive zeal, area
like inimical to both.
To attain this raoft definable end, our love of
peace, of country, and of mankind, didlatcs a
wish that every just expedient (hould be resort
ed to, for removing every prejudice, real or im
aginary, which may have obtained âThis, we
conceive,Â»woulb be the best effe&ed by an en
voy extraordinary, who could not upon this oc
casion use language more expreflive of our wilh
es to cultivate friendfliip with that republic,
than the fa<S\ will juftify.
Here, Sir, let us pause before we come to the
dread alternative âthe thought of which we
would wilh to obliterate, if felf government
and property were not deposits too precious and
too sacred to be rudely approached l>y any na
tion, even the raoft favored.
Under these impressions you will readily per
ceive, that if France can poffiblyhave abandon
ed her plighted faith,and so otten avowed affec
tions 4 and infiduouflj'calculates upon our gene
rous partiality, as the means of tolerating any
intermeddling with our privileges, property, or
engagements with other nations, we cannot hc
fitate to declare, that we are decidedly and un
alterably determined to support, to the utmost
of our ability, all the constitutional measures of
the American government, to redress its wrongs,
and defend its rights, sgainft the encroachments
of every nation on earth ; as it is the one of
our choice, and is endeared to us by the blcfT
ings it hit hitherto afforded.
CONGRESS.
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES,
Tuesday, May 23.
In a committee of the whole, Mr. Dent in the
chair, on the answer reported to the Prcfi
dent's Speech, Mr. Nicholas's proposition
being under confederation :
Mr. Rotledge said, when the report of
the committee (hould be befujre them, he
(hould have some remarks to make upon it;
but at present he (hould effer only a few
observations upon the proposed amendment.
Hefaidhehadfeveralftrong objettions to the
amendment; but one so Strong that he seed
not urge any other : it was, that in agreeing
to it they (hould di&ate to the Executive,
which he believed would be infringing upon
the Executive Power. As it was his pe
culiai duty to give initru&ions to Miniftert,
it would be improper in them to fay what
(hould be the inftru&ions given to a minister ;
but if it were r.ot so, he (hould not vote for
those of the gentleman from Virginia.
In the inftruftions of a minister, it wasufual
to comprize a variety of proportions. Cer
tain Things were tirlt to be proposed; if,
these could not be obtained, he was itiftrua
ted to come forward with foniething else,
and if this could not be got, he went on to
his ultimatum. But, if the proposition of
:he gentleman from Virginia were obtained,
his infttuftions would be publicly known. In
vain would it be for lura to offer tliia or that,
they will fay the House of Representatives
has directed you what to do, and we will
not agree to any thing else. This would
be contrary to all diplomatic proceedings ;
for that reason, he (hould be opposed to the
house faying what (hould be his inllruflions.
Indeed if it were usual, lie (hould be against
it in this ioflance, as he believed it would en
courage an extravagant demand. W hat, said
he, have they said to our minister (or rather
to the person who was formerly our minister,
but who then had no power ?) They told
him to go away, (hey had nothing to fay to
him, they would receive no more minilterg
from the United States until their grievan
ces were redressed. This country is chargad
with countenancing an inequality of treaties.
The French have said, redress our grievances
in a certain way. ' But, laid Mr. Rutledgr,
ifw"e do this, we (hall put ourselves under
the dominion of a foreign'poÂ»er, and (hall
have toaika foreign country, what we (hall
do. This was a Situation into which we must
not fall without a struggle.
Though he were npon the committee, he
bad contiibuted very little to the composition
of the atifwer reported. He thought it, how
ever, a proper address j but he was willing
that it might undergo any modification which
(hould not alter the fubftancc of it.
Mr. Sitgrsaves said, though he had wiSh
ed to have taken a little more time before he
had troubled the csmmittee with his observa
tions ; yet as there now appeared an interval,
he (hould take the opportunity ofoccupjing
it, for a few minutes.
He (hould not answer the observations of
the gentleman from Georgia, with reffieft
to the Style of the answer reported ; but he
believed that those gentlemen who would
look at it without a perverted vision, would
not discover the faults in it which that gentle
man had dif*cvfred~-Hr thought it rather
| remaricafclc for the fiu pÂ»lc2: j- i f Iti. fiylr, than
' for <Â» redundancy of epithet. IK* ilifco7er.
more of the latter in the than io
the original rrpoit. There aie, indeed,
(operatives in both ; but th<-r arc attached
to oppolitt fcnttmentt, and iu the original
report they are ufrd where they ought to be.
He would not, however, detain the commit
tee with matter so immaterial, but would pro
ceed to what appealed to him of some cenfe
quenee
A llranger who had come into the house
durin* this debate, and heard what had fallen
from the mover of the propflfed amendment,"
and from mrir.beri who had followed him,
would ha>e supposed that, ir.ftcad of in adt'
'ofordinary, tnteri ourfe being under difcufiior,
they hart bee# debating the quettion of a
Dwlaration of War egainft France.
He would declare, for hiiafelf at leatl, on
tht fubjefl of war, that he agreed in certain'
of the fcntinems of gentlemen dn rhe other
fide of the house. A ftaie of war waÂ» cer
tainly a curse to any nationâto Atflcrica it*
would be peculiarly a curse. Jt ought to be
avoided by all pof&blc means, it waÂ» not on
ly impolitic,but madness, to lufii wantonly iu.
to a war. Bin he thought there were two
fides of thefubjeft. He thought that peace w?Â»
not the greatest of all pofiible blefTings ; he
thought that peace might be puichafedtoodear,
and war avoided at too great an expencc. He
thought that peace might coll what is of
greater value than moneyâour Independence.
This was no new sentiment in this country.
It was thought that peace mijht be bought
too dearly in the revolutionary war ; they
then thought it better to be at war than to
submit to tke alternative evils. France also
shews that (he prefers a state of war
carried on at an unexampledexpence of blood
and treasureâto a state of peace with despo
tism. He tho't therefore that we should adopt
language of a firm and manly tone. To pre
serve peace by all honourable means, but not
by dilhonouraUe means. As he observed
last feflion, on a similar occasion, we (hould
cultivate peace with zeal and fwcerity ; but
whenever our intention for doing so w as pub
licly expressed, it ought to be accompanied
with an opposite afl'ertiou, of a determina
tion, if our endeavours to maintain peace fail,
that then every resource of the r.atiÂ«n (hall
be calledjinto exigence in fuppott of all that
is dear to us. Such a declaration, at this
time, was extremely proper. At present, he
said, all the obl'ervations which had been made
relative to war, were very premature. They
might be brought into consideration, when
any measure (hould be difcufled which might
lead to a war with France, Then would be
the time to count the cost and calculate the
benefit. At present, he conceived, our only ,
oljeft was, to enquire what were the feelings
which the conduct of Fiance had created iihf
our minds, and whether we we were ptepa-i
red to express those feelingf.
-Shall we, said he, from a fear of irritating
the French Republic, in a communication
with our owe executive, suppress our feelings,
or what is worse, suppress the truth ? For
h*s own part, he saw nothing in the present
business, but an exprcflioh of feelings natu
rally excited by the occasion ; nothing but a
declaration of fails. This being the cafr,
the quellion was, whether, from fear of tr
ritatirig the Fiench Government, they (hould
suppress these feelings and thefÂ« fail*. }
It would be well to .consider what would
be the consequence of this coudefceiiiion.
He did not think the\ were warranted inbe
lieving that they (hould put France in a bet
ter humour with us by this means. He wÂ«a
sure that gentlemen who were in the last
Congress would recollcft that the answer to
the address was reported in very mild terms,
from a spirit of accomodation in the commit
tee who formed it, and that it was afterwards
pruned in the house with care, yet there hzd
been no amelioration of the drfpofition of the
French towards this country. Instead of in
ducing, them to behave better to us, had it
not been with a knowledge of this that tljey
have offered us frefh insult. and indignity /
Indeed, Mr. Pinckney idea that
this moderation of ours may have been one
of the operating causes of fending our mi
nister from their country.
Besides, gentlemen have not pointed out
the particular expressions which tfiey cosfidcr
as irritating in the report. For his own part
he thjught the amendment might be conliJ.
ered as more irritating than the draft of the
committee. What was the language of the
amendment ? [He read it.] He gave it
as his opinion, that there was more of wais
and bullying in it than in the original report.
It was true the threat it contained was ac
companied by an if Now all the difference
betwixt the draft and the amendment was,
that in the former, instead of using the if,
thÂ»y had at once expelled indignation at the
insults offered to this country by the Frencli
republic, and given aflurances to the Execu
tive that they would repel indignity with in
dignation. *
But if this fubjeft was to be oonfidered, he
would turn to a part of the gentleman's pro-
I position, not indeed immediately befoie them,
j but which he had declared it his intention to
j bring forward, where he fays, " we will repel
all unjust demands upon the United States
; by foreign countries; that we will ever con
sider the humiliation of the government at
the greatest personal difgracc," He wsi
willing to a& upon the gentleman's oivn'priiÂ»
ciples. If we think th:re have been any u'n
jull demands upon the United States by fo
reign nations, it is then our duty to repel
them. The que,(lion was therefore narrpwe !,
and they had only to Uy, whether the de
mands made by the French government were
just or unjust.
The gentleman from Virginia thought aU
so pl-opfr to tell the committee, that majori<
tits had pushed the House too far, and had
expefled minorities to facrifice their opinions..
The gentleman was very tenacious of his own
opinion, and he trusted he would fuffer others
to be equally so of theirs. If that gentleman,
said Mr. S. thinks the demands of France are
not unjyit, I think they are. They had
been declared to be unjust' iu the mod folemtt
manner, by former Congtrfles, and on fotnif ioccafior.s tsith psif.-ft.unanimity i-ffcijliirrnt
and fulTiage ; and, if t)ie corjyyit'ee think
they jre, so, it was the gentleman's own po
rtion that thry should fay fa.; and if .they
were uijufl, tbev Ihould be repelled, and the
United States (hould look .forward t;> that
Date of things, when it shall he ueceflary to

lie did not think it neccflarytoreprit his wilhej
fur peace. He thought it pofTiblo for this Go
vrriiner.t to purfiie a line of CondufJ which,
whilst it secured our neutral rights, would not
be a departure from our neutral obligations.
Hewifbedto take-a lit'le notiei'of what had
sal en from ibe gentleman from Virginia, on the
I'uLje.'t at ljcnficc of epinion. He had already
oblerved tnat he hoped that gentlemjp would
allow the fame liberty of fentimerit to dthers
which he claimed for himftlf. He would not
ftophere. After great ptiblic measures have
been the objeft of deliberate difciiffion in other
branches of the' government, and have hem car
ried by a raajority, he thought it the duty of a
minority to acquicfee in the determination. â
It is the chief duty of the members of a re
publican government âWhere through the re
presentative channel the epiniens of all the ci
tizens are communicated, it cannot be expe<9ed
but that on great otcafioiu there will be a differ- 1
enceof ientiment; and thiÂ«unavoidable diffcr
erce creates the obligation of perfect acqaief-
C.cnce in the major opinion ; for otherwise there
would be a perpetual conflifl between the mem
bers of the fame government.
It was from this opinion that he wis concern
ed to litar the past eonduift of any branch of the
government censured. Whatever legitimate afls
of government were parted, they should be pro
tefUd by the mil' ority as well as the majorityâ
They Ihould be held as sacred and never blown
upon by us. They should hold but one
in their support. Whatever difference of opini
niJH might exist amongst theinfelves, this dif
ference ought not to appear in their afls to fo
reign nations. âWe ihould speak. said he, in
these cafe*, but as one people. Therefore, if
the answer to the President's addrels, be an in
flrumentof which the French Kepubliemay take
notice, it Ihould not appear to them that we have
been at any time, or are now, divided in the
fctttiments which it contains : theafls of the go
vernment are the a&s of the country, and net
a whisper Ihould efeapefrom us in opposition to
them, when they have been concluded and car
ried into effril.
He wiflied the gentleman from Virginia had
omitted his observations with refpeflto faSions
which may exist in this country, as there was
no necellary connexion betwixt that fubjefl and
the onrunder confederation. It was one which
ought to be kept out afview within those walls.
It was to be regretted that the press .was conta
minated with this kind of rubbifo; but when
the gentleman had exprefled his contempt for
charges of thw fort, he lbould have extended it
to both fides of the house: For if French faHion
was tried out on one fide Briti/h faction on the
other, had for these last four years been rung
from New Hampshire to Georgia. He should
have spared the committee these remarks, if the
gcptlcman had not, perhaps unwillingly, in some
degree added to the odium which was cast
upon one fide of the house, by fayisg that when
he firft came into the government he found a
general disposition againll the French eaufe ,
and even against Republican government (Mr.
Nicholas denied having used this laftexprefiion )
Mr. S. said he so understood him. However,
when he fpokt of the exinence of parties, he
â wilted he had looked on both fides of the quef
tisn.
But, said he, let us on this occaflon confine
ourfelvea to the real queilion before us. We
have been informed, said he, by the President,
in his speech to both houses, of the conduct of
the French towards this government, and have
fiuce received the documents upon which this
report was founded. He had not heard any
gentlemen juftify the condudl of the French.
He had heard, indeed, some attempts to palli
ate or apologize for it, but none to vindicate it.
His ideas of these things were, that the French
had not only injnred us, but added insult to in
jury ; and whilfl he retained this belief he could
not help feeling indignation and resentment.
Ou.- atflions, better than our words Ihew our
desires for peace. It was a desire in which we
were too much interested, t<> render its sincerity
at all questionable ; yet it was proper that this
desire should be accompanied with expressions of
our feelings on the oceafion âWhat objections
could there be to this ? If we were funk so low,
if our fears of the French republic aie so great,
that we dare not express what we feel, our si
tuation was really deplorable- He hoped this
was not, nor ever would be the cafe. He ho
ped we should cultivate peace with sincerity.
but with firmnefs. For if the French republic
is so terrible to us, that we ttiuft crouch and fink
before her ; if we hold our rights at her nod,let
gentlemen fay so. And if we are to give our
fclves up to her, let it be an aft of the govvern
nurit, founded on our sense of weakness ; do
not let uÂ» conceal, under the appearance of spi
rit, aflual fubmiflion. Nations, it was true,
might be brought into such a situation as to be
obliged to surrender some of their rights to other
nations ; but, when this is done, it should be
done with some degree Â«f character. Let it not
be done as a confrfTimi of guilt. Let us said he,
surrender any thing sooner than the fair fame of
our country. He was not a military man, not
did he know how he should aft upon such an
ertafion ; but he knew what we ought to do.
We ought, rather to die in tit lajl ditch. Why
insinuate that rhe government had been wrong ?
Was it not enough to submit to iajury ; foall we
not only receive the Uripts, but kiss the rod that
them ?
But, said he, arc we in this situation ? Must
we surrender any <*f our rights?âHe knew if
we fubinitted to injury and insult, this would be
the unavoidable contequence. He disdained a
ny reliance on the generous magnanimity of the
Jrench Republic. He thought htr condufl to
wards this countryjustified 110 such reliance.
He was of oginion we ought to take a firm
And decided attitude on this oicalion, and at a
my rate, before we mike a surrender of our rights
<we ought to make a ftruggleto retain them.
Mr. S. said he had made these observations
snore witn a desire to prevent any falfe reprcfen
tions of the views of the house from going a
broad, thau from a desire to throw much ad
ditional light on the fubjeÂ£Â». For his own part,
he fa * nothing in the reportedanfwer that could
either irritate, or offend against decorum. We
aiTertthat we have not injured the French Re
public, but if foe will injure us, we will defend
ourfclves. Thinking thus he should be in fa
vor of the original report, and agaiaft the a
mendment.
Mr. Otii observed, that he was so little
accudomed to tie mode of coudu&ing a de
hate in that honorable house, that he hardly
knew in what manner to apply his remarks
to the fubjert before the committee. A fpe
cific motion had keen laid on the table by
the jcntleman from Virginia, which reduced
the true queflion before them to a narrow
compaft; but the mover in difcufTiaghitown
propofuion, hart *&!.â¢â¢ ised up<*i fuhjefts clear
to his mind, and familiar to Wis reccllrclion.
In this circuit t.c Lad been ably followed by
the gentleman Carolina, Â»*d o
theis; so thatthe whole fuUjeCt of the idÂ» refs
of the Prefident,,jnd the reply of the com
mittee, was brought into view, with many
tonfiderations that did not belong it.. It was
his design to have remained lilcnt un'il the
fubjeft had been cxhauded by other gentle
men, and if any remark of an important na
ture had been omitted, which was not likely
to be the cafe, he would have suggested such
ideas as might have presented themselves to
his mind ; but a motion having been made
for the committee to rife, he would then of
fer a few observations, not so much for the
fake of illuflrating the qieftion, which bad
been done so much more fuccefsfully, but in
order to declaie his sentiments upon this 1m
portent eccafion. He so faragreed wiih the
gentleman from Georgia, that he believed,
upon ordinary Occasions, an answer to the
President's address should be calculated to
preserve an harmonious intcrcourfe between
the different departments of government,
rather than to pledge either branch of the
legislature collaterally, upon fubjeÂ£ls that
would come regularly- under their con.'idera
tion. But the present was not an ordinary
oceafion, and the situation of the country re
quired that the answer (hould not be a spirit
less exprefiion of civility, but a new edition of
the declaration of independence. He exprefled
his regret that upon this question gentlemen
should hava wandered into a review of mea
furcs and fubje&s, so frequently examined,
so deliberately fettled, and which had a ten.
dency to re-kindle party animosity. If they
would never acqtiÃ-fce in the deliberate afis
of the government, because perfonal
sentiments had been averse tÂ» them in the
season of their difeuflion, there could be no
end to controversyâfor his part he conceived
that all party diftinftions ought now to cease;
and that the House was now called on by a
warning voice, to destroy the idea of geogra
phical division of sentiment and interest exist
ing among the paople. His conftitucnts, and
himfelf, were disposed to regard the inhabi
tants of the southern fl&tss as brothers, whose
featufes were cast in the fame'mould, and who
had waded through the fame troubled waters
to the shore of liberty and independenceâ
He hoped that gentlemen would, in their
tilrn, think the other part of the union enti
tled to some consideration.
The address of the President difelofed, for
the contemplation of the committee, 1 a narra
tive of fads, and of the exilting caufesofcon
verfy between the French republic and our.
selves ; the overtures for reconciliatios, which
were to be repeated by attempts to negociate,
and the measures of defence that might be
proper, in cafe negociation should fail. The
injuries sustained by us were of a high and
atioeious nature, confiding in the capture of
our vessels, depredations upon the property
and persons of our citizens, the indignity gf
feied to our minister; but what was more
aggravating than the reft, was, the prafefled
determination not to receive our minifler un
til the complaints of the French should be
redrefied, without explanation and without
exceptionâuntil we should violate treaties,
repeal laws, and da what the constitution
would not authorise, vaeate solemn judgments
of our courts of law. These injuries should
not be concealed ; he did not wish, however,
to indulge the unnecessary expreflions of in
dignation, but to state in plain and unequivo
cal terms the remonflrances of injured friend.
ship. If any man doubted cf the pernicious
effefls of the measures of the French nation,
and of the adual ft ate of our commerce, let
him enquire of the ruined and unfortunate
merchant, harralTed with profeeutions on ac
count of the revenue, which he so long and
patiently toiled to fupport^âlf any doubted
of its efFeÂ£ls upon agriculture, let him enquire
of the farmer, whose prdouce is falling and
will be exposed to perish in his barnsâWhere,
said he, are your sailors? Listen to the pas
sing gale of the ocean and you will hear their
groans ifluing from French prison ships.
Such were the injuries, and such the requisi
tions of the French nation ; and he defied the
ingenuity of any gentleman to draw a com
parison between the Dire&ory and the Briiifh
Parliament, in favor of the former ; and in
filled that the demands of Charles de la
Croix were upon a parallel with those of lord
North. He enlarged upon the analogy of the
circumstances attending the pretentions of the
British government to bind us, when we were
coloniea, and of the French to us,
now we are free and independent Hates ; he
thought it expedient to cultivate the fame
spirit of union, and to use the fame firm and
decided language. He regretted that ques
tions should be agitated upon this oceafion,
which had been formerly the cause of party
spirit and diflenfions ; and did not believe
that the immortal men who framed the noted
instrument which difflolved the charm of al
legiance and (hivered the fetters of tyranny,
condescended to differ about verbal criticisms
and nice expreflions, thro' fear of giving of
fence ; nor that it was incumbent upon the
members of the committee to repress the as
sertions of their rights, or smother a jutt and
dignified expreflion of their fiifceptibility of
insult, because the French had been once our
friends, or because the commencement of their
revolution was a ftru;'gle for liberty. There
was a time when he was animated with en
thusiasm in favor of the French revolution,
and he cherished it. while civil liberty appear
ed to be the obje&âbut he now connfiered
that revolution as completely atchieved, antl
that the war was continued, not for liberty,
but for conquelt and aggrandisement, to
which he did not believe it was the interefl of
this country to contribute. The only precise
obje&ion which he recolle&ed to a full decla
ration of our sense of injury, was the differ
ence of the system, which, it was fuggefled,
had been adopted by government, towards
â  lie Biitifh, under firailar circumstances of
unjust aggrtflion. But if it were ttue that
this difference existed, it did not become those
who thought the measures of government
wrong upon that occafiin, to advocate * re
petition of error. In his opinion however a
dilfeience of measures would be juflifiable by
a reQedion upon the causes which induced
the Briiiili dtprejaiiuns, anJ th'-fe to win <i
the measures of the frem*'i miv he affi;ned j
and yet there was not in fa<3 i hr variance be
twee.i the plans reoomtfTonJeJ by the sup
porters of the late Erse utive, and adopted
towards the Britiflv, and rh f; whieh have
been purfueC, and are now defended, with
refpeft to the French, Â«ht;h gentlemen were
ready to imagine. He was contented to re 1%
the firft of these positions upon the faÂ£la, that
the BritiHi were Simulated to annoy uur com
merce, through an appreh'nf.vn that we litre
united again/3 tkrm, and the French, by a belief
that tufwere divided in their favor. To un
deceive thrm in these opposite prejudices
might have required or at lealt jtftified difli
milar modes of speaking and ailing. Yet
the language adopted, and the measures ad- j
vocated, were nearly alikeâTo fay nothing j
of the late inftruflions to Mr. Pinckney, the j
famous memorial of Mr Jay to lord Gren
vilie, which has been the fubjeA of so much
calumny, was not couched in more concilia
tory ot ttnafTuming terms, than the answer
of the House of Representatives to the Presi
dent's speech atthe la ft feffionâ(tie rsad here
the answer) âand yet it is intimated by our
minister Mr. Pinckney (a man who, he hoped,
was not meant to be-included by the gentle
man from Maflachufetts in the description of
Bri'iOi influence ; a man of high and untar
nished reputation and known attachment to
his country) that this very answer was pro
bably among the causes of theconduft of ihe
DirectoryâHe then added some further ob
servations, to prove, that when the country
was menaced with Briiifh hoftiliiies, measures
of defence had been proposed by the friends
to the administration, comptifing the equip,
ment of a navy, fortifying ihe ports and or
ganizing the militia.
Having thus, as he contended, demon'
ftrated the / right and propriety of Rating
our complaints, his adverted to the next im
portant fubjeft contained in th- speech :
" the refolutian of the Executive still to per
fifl in pacific means of negociation," and
what thus led to analyse the motion for a
mendment submitted to the committee. He
sincerely approved of this intention of the
Executive, and most earnestly wished that it
might be attended with success : No man
could more anxiously deprecate a war, than
himfelf, or was more impressed with a persua
sion of its calamities; and he knew that his
constituents were solicitous to avoid it by all
honourable means. The preamble of this
motion was not in his view objeiflionable ;
but to cxprefs the sentiment " that the French
merely intended to fufpind the ordinary, and
bring into use the extraordinary means of inter
course with foreign nations, was decidedly a
gainli his judgement. Was it pefiible for
any man of veracity to make this declara
tion r If this was really the sole objett of the
Directory it would hare juftified thedifratffi
of Mr. Monroe, equally with a refufal to re
ceive Mr. Pinckney. A wish to suspend the
ordinary inter'eourfe would have been display
ed in their conduit to the resident minilter :
yet Mr. Monroe was not only permitted to
reside is France in his public capacity for
many months subsequent to the pretended
grievances, but was told by the Diredtory,
â¢* that he parted with their regret.'* It was
therefore a mod absurd and humiliating apo
logy which gentlemen were disposed to fur
nilh to the French Dire&ory; he believd
they would smile at and disavow it. He
thought it degrading to make, in J heir be
half, timid excuses, whieh they would dis
dain to accept- The only chance for a pro
pitious iflue by negociation, depended upon
permitting the executive the constitutional
depoQtory of this right, to exercise a free
agency, and the subsequent clanfe of the
motion, which diftated terms to tie execu
tive in the removal of the inequalities of our.
treaties, was equally impolitic and injudici
ous. It was probable that the executive
would make the concelfion alluded to by the
gentleman, if an equivalent could be obtain
ed, by a compensation for our ioffrs, and the
security of our peace ; but of this he mutt
be the judge, and we should leave him free
to grant it as a facritice made to the desire
of peace, and not authorize the French to
claim it as a rightâif it was known before
hand, that the exeeutive was bound, and
that the minister was inilru&ed, to remove
a pretended eaufe of grievance, without any
flipulation for an equivalent, he would com
mence his overtures under manifeft disadvan
tage. The Direftory, secure of one pre
teufion, would probably urge others. In the
prefentcafe, there was 110 reason to conclude
that the grievance ariling from " the inequali
ty of exijling treaties," which was the only
one mentioned 6y the mover, was the princi
pal source of our disagreement with the
French, or that removing that alone vwsuld
Â«lfe& our objeft. Did he therefore mean to
pinion the executive down ta that (ingle con
cession ? Or would he enlarge his motion,
and diredt the executive to fay that our laws
should be repealed, and the judgments of our
C9urtÃ vacated ? Was it wife or politic to
publiffo to the world, at the outset of an Em
bassy, the ultimate terms that were to be of
fered, and to fend an envoy with open orders
ta accede to every demand of the French
Natien ? If he was tÂ» b.' dispatched under
these auspices, let him be decorated not with
the cap of liberty, upon which our former
motto, was " liberty or death," but fuL,fti( ute
in it*.place " humiliation andfubmiffiou to your
will." He may then perhaps be admitted
to th: honors of a fitting.
Mr. Otis then proceeded to the last divi-
Gon of his fubjeft, the means of defence re
commended i'j the speech. It was, he said,
unfair to conncfl with an approbation of such
measures a difpofuion for hostilities with the
French. War was the greatest of all pofli
ble calamities into which the pride of kings,
or the ambition of rulers, could plunge and
provoke an unoffending aud neutral natior.
He did not presume that any member in that
house could derive a benefit from so deplora
ble a condition ol society. But a small por.
tion of them would probably go into the ar
my ; and of that portion, few could expeft
to make foitunes by their commifiions. A
desire of war, was therefore entirely out of
the queflion. He never undcrftcod that

That independent territory, was expoferl like
our own country to the. unfounded cr.fjiiii.il

quisitions of the French ; it bravely infilled
upon the right of remaining neuter, and an
notyicrd itsdrlign of augmenting iia milita
ry eftablilhaieni, tor the proteilion and-.nain
tetiance of its r.eutrality. Perhaps this car
ton may be compelled to dipart from tilts sys
tem. Possibly it 1,:.s no longer the power of
exercising its own will ; but it will not be
pretended that this defenlive conduit evinced
on their part, a willingness to be engaged in
war. It was then a fimpleenquiry, whether
under the prcfent afpeft of our effaits, war
might not be brouglft home to our doois,
contrary to our wishes, and prior to a Hate
of preparation. Gentlemen were willing to
fay, that if negociation failed, there would
bean end to every friendly relation between
the two countries. Our poflure then would
be unfriendly: and who can fay it will no:
fail ? If a war with this country makes any
part 6f the fxflem French aggrandise
ment, we should probably have it without the
forms of confutation. Do gentlemen sup
pose that when negociation shall have abso
lutely failed, the French will give us time to
equip our veflelfe, fottify our ports, and bur
nish our arms, in order to (hew us fair play.
Let gentlemen consider our defencelefs situa
tion in such citcum'tances.âLet them not
pause until it should be too late.âThe tide
of conquell has deluged Europe ; it might
swell the great Atlantic, and roll towards our
shores, bringing upon its troubled fuiface
the spirit of revolution, which might spread
like a pestilence, poflibly in the Southern
States, and excite a war of themoli dreadful
kindâof slaves agaiuft their mailers ; and
thereby endanger the exillence of that union
so dear to his conllituents, and the reparation
of which would be painful as the agonies of
death. He concluded with many other ob
fcrvations, having for their ofcjeit, th'e pre
servation of the Union, the necessity of form
ing and displaying a national chara&er, and
a demonstration of the absurdity of suppo
sing that the President of the United States,

I am at a Ipls to underdand what gentlemen
mean by undertlking to jujtify the Preficient in a
late appointment he made. As for Mr Bache, it

any nt ceflity for the friends of government endea

has mifreprefunted the matter by Rating it to be a
new appointment; but allowing tliat it -was a new
appointment, what d fhonor could accrue to the
PreQdent for making it ? It is always the duty rf
the Executive to place in ofiice thole whom he
deems moll worthy; and to withhÂ®ld it from any
man of merit, merely because he was a relation,
would be extremely censurable, since it would 1*

It used to be remarked by way of en:ominm
upon the adminiflration of Walhington, that he
never appointed a relation to fill any public flntion.
For my part, though I revcrethc excellence of this
