At the table of a friend a few days ago, '
when the fybjeft of the French [puliation# r
was topic of converfatiori, a gentle in in pre
â¢fenr ftreiiHpufly advocated the arneing our ,
niei:clisi>t veffeta, and at length-deelated in
the hoileft and warmth cf his rtTent- 1
ment, that '-' he would arm his (hips and 0
theylhojiy fight theirway"; that he "would 11
do the (/me aflSjinft any nation, being one of
the nK'nuriaitlb to Congress (when Great- 15

hcJ'.ilities being commenced againf< her''â

' tunalc that Cbrtgtcfs did not adopt the measure >
at that time so recommended," he ingenuously
confefftd he did and that their v/ifjom ivas 1
evident Lr the event. ,
This fubjeft being now before the house c
eif rsprefentatives and a bill aboijt to be in
troduced, I cannot refrain from offering a
feyv thoughts Â«n the occasion.
It is generally considered that every mer- 1
chant. tkas a right to adventure his property 1
as he thinks fit, and if exposed to unjust a
hazard tp defend it ; but though this is not '
now inUndtd to be denied, it must be e- c
qually admitted that he has no right to i
hazard the 'property, or compromit the 1
peace of others, or of his country. The J
i:n:iu'.bcri%ed a3 cf an individual, and the or
/ "s or fnnSion of a nation, are to be conjider
sd differently.
Before thofu difficulties of which we com-
pk'iu, onr produte was abundant and there
fore low in ell the Wrjl-India ijlands (the '
chief rr.aikets for its ventj ; now it is not
so plenty, the tupplies aiÂ®e more uncertain j
and precarious 9 and prices consequently and
naturally higher, augmented in greater propor
tions than the difference of insurance. Who
pays this encreafe bf price ? is it not the con
sumer ? certainly it isâevery man who eats '
bread in <the Wejl-Indies, or requires ajhingle
or a board contributes to pay for the insurance
of ourJhips and cargoes. It is evidently and
unquestionably the interest of those who eat
the most of it to gaard and profeft this com
mcree, and thereby the danger to
which their necejfifries of life are exposed.
Is there any price to which the chief ar
ticles of onr export cas be raised during war
tfme that will prevent thsir being demanded
coufumed in the islands ? every man
who kas been there, will Â£ay noâthey can
Â«ot get them through any other channel,
and cannot do without the<m ; but is is said
that every vefTel taken is so much Iwfs to the
Country, which is conceived to be amiftake, 1
except when uninsured ; and if imprudent
men, urged by too great an avidity for gain are I
thereby disappointed, it is net the interceptions of
our commerce they are to complain of; that o-
Bininti however is right as to* vefiels that
Foundftr or are wrecked, whethrtr insured or
not ; the difference is material between the
two pcHfitkjps, and it is neceffarf to be just
ly comp-ehended in order to a trua judg
ment jor proper inference.
If four vessels be insured to an island aÂ»d
back at 30 per cent, and ene is t:\ken, the
* owners of those that ani'ie get a greater sum
for their cargoes, and fafficient to pay for
the cqft, freight and premium of infurauee,
which they bring home is da it with, and the
underwriters arc enabled to pay the loss of
the one taken by the
that Arrivedâ it is otherwise when a vessel
is wracked or foundersâthen it its a nation
al loss.
But will arming our vessels tend ito reduce
prerniuirs of insurance ? it is conceived not,
for the French will add (Irength to their
crifiztra fufficient to contend for prize mo
ney and plunder ; and if premiums a#e low
ered, will more of our flour, fi(h, bread,
ria e, or provisions of any fort be eaten,pr will
they bring better prices or leave so good a
profit ? this applies equally to the European
trade, the articles of coffee and fu'gar which
we import and telhip are sent to, market
loaded with every additional exponce which
the danger and difficulty of procuring and
conveying thither occasiOns ; what else has
Taifed the price of them in all the markets
of Europe I What fay feh-et mercaritile let
ters of advice ? Send coffee, sugars, tobac
co, See. the pr ices will bear even the high
premiums of infurauee and freight.
Now Mr. Fenno, I think with my table
companion, that it was fortunate we did not
arm on a former occasion, and I am not less
certain we (hould avoid, at least postpone it
now, rather adopting the plan pointed out
in my4aft, or something free from the spil
ling of blood, which once begun will not
easily be (loppedâwhile it closes ths door of
reparation for the pajl, without even a hope of
benefit for the future.
A FRIEND TO LAWS & FRE-EDOM.
Dec. 13 th.
From the (LONDON) COURIER.
Mrs. NESBITT.
This celebrated woman h3s become the
topic of universal conversation, from the
mention which CitizeirNoFL* makes of her
tranfaftions in Germany j and (he is likely
to fuffer a great deal of impertinent dander
on account of the allusion to her name. It
certainly is no difqredit to the S cx > an
accompliftied woman is capable of playing a
partvfo confpfcuous and inlereftirvg to the
fate of natiur.s, as that which MrÂ». Ncfbitt
has lately performed. During the lail
twenty yeafs we will venture to fay that no
just reproach can be thrown on her moral
, conduft. The allusions made to her ac
quaintance with Mr. Rose are illiberal. Hej.
* Tfie I, t'Udon PÂ»r eri have inserted the letter
here a'lude<l t >, as being wr.'t n by Citizen Noel
the French (V-rLaffador at ths Hague ; whereas it
i, an intercepted letter, written by Come person
employed by, C>e coakfeed Powers, and which,
falling into'the hands of the Arnj.ffador wasfent
by him tp thu JSlinitter of Police at Pans.
atfinacjr with ir.an'y of the iofiofi JiftingcHh- evt
:d char'a&ors of the age, with "Lorfl Thur- i by
ow and others, was no other than the foci- | mc
_-ty cf kindred minds. An intelligent wo- |no
nan in the decline of years, poffefling the ' th
â¢harms of conversation, unreitraiued by pro- th
dery, and endowed with elejaftt talents im
proved by a knowledge of the world, drew tei
around her is (cleft circle of friends, arid p.:
made her retirement at Norwood defirabie'io i vÂ»J
the Politician .and the Scholar, from its in- so
teliecinjl and unembarrassed politics. We
abhor the idea of pflrfuing political hoftiii- ch
ties into private life ; we sincerely believe of
that. Mr. Rose cultivated,the acquaintance so
of Mrs. Ncibitt from the attrsdibu of jjjsr
m'fid ; and he introduced his young family
to her .house, that they miglit form their
manner? under so perfeita model.
Such has been the lituationof Mrs.Nefbitt
for the last â  twenty years. With an inde-
pendent fortune of between 2 and 30001. a
year, debarred 1 in a great degree from the
ftmale world by the early events of herltiflo- L
ry, surrounded by men of the firft dillinfti
on, it was no wonder that a woman so eri- , I
dowed, and so fuccefsful, (hould be induced
to turn her talents into political intrigue.
Her marriage a-la-main gauche with a Ger
man Prince introduced her to the best focie- [ 1
ty at the Courts of Germany ; and in all
the diplomatic circles (lie was considered as
a woman of infinite address and of profound ,
discernment. Oar readers are not ignorant !
of tbenature of a German marriage a-la-main â¢
gauche. The pride of jroyalty will not per- !
mit a Prince to marry a woman of inferior b
rank otherways than with the left hand. "
This, withdut elevating the lady to the '>
Blood Royal, preserves hercharafter unftain- j 1
ed, and (he is received into society with re- P
fpeft. The conntftions thpt (he formed in si
the Empire and Switzerland, her knowledge I n
of the languages, the symmetry of her per- j a
son which made it easy for her to assume the 0
male habit, and the confidence reposed in
her by Mfnifters, pointed her out as a pro- t
per agent ; and on the sth of August 1795 I
(he left England, and has ever fmce resided v
in various parts of the Continent. It is not r
easy to develope the course (he has pursued; 1
but until it (lull be declared infamous for j.
Court* to employ fecnet agents, it surely I
cannot be imputed to hÂ»r as a crime that her Â«
accomplishments entitled her to the appoint- 1
merit.
We know that public curiosity will not be '
fatisfied until we (hall tear off the ma(k from 1
the early periods of her hiftoryâatid yet no- 1
thing can be more base and detestable in '
Morality than such an exposure. Let the '
generosity of the sex decide upon this quef
tiou. If youthful frailty cannot be atoned |
for by years of honourable lifeâif no (hade 1
is tobecaft over the errors of an inexperienc- '<
ed and a deluded heart, but the fcrvility of 1
virtue it to persecute with eternal exclufurn
the female who has once erred, what a hor
rible tyranny is that of the Public Tribunal
But Gallantry, and s he cause of Virtue it
felf, join in the rescue of the Sex ; and on
ly vicious malignity, or horrid defign,would
recal the memory of repentant error. Mrs.
Nefbitt has had to combat through life with
the prejudice which her firft conneftiÂ»tis
excited : and the woman whom the dread
ful pen of Junius coniigned to an immortal
ity of disgrace, could only rife superior to
the memorial by extranrdrrrary
yet this (he has effected. Notwithstanding
the recorded anecdote of her marriage with
Mr. Nefbitt, and the mifcellanv of her life,
(he has acquired an elevation in life which
(he has preserved with dignitybecaufe (he has
afted with moderation. She has used her
influence with the great, in favor ef the un
fortunate ; and many deserving men owe
their present fituatioDs in public life to the
patronage of this Lady.
STATE PAPER.
Decree of his catholic majesty, prescribing
regulations to be observed in the condem
nation of prizes brought intoSpani(h har
bors :
" The king being desirous, that, in trials
relative to prizes, all doubts (hould be re
moved which may occasion loss and delays,
to the prejudice of persons interested, or
give rife to difficulties with other courts â
The Prince of peace, our firft secretary of
State has prepefed to us what appeared to
him a proper remedy. Agreeably to his
'proportion, and after having consulted our
Supreme council of war, we have pa(Ted
the following decree :
Art. 1. The immunity of the coasts of
our dominions (hall not be marked, as here
tofore, by the doubtful and uncertain reach
s of cannon, but by the distance of two miles
of 950 toifes each.
1. Prizes made within th* said two miles
â  fiiall be tried according to the usual and es
tablished forms, before the tribunals in
r whichethe governors andcommandantsofour
f ports preside, to whore we give this jurif
di&isn.
3. No prize made within the said limits
(hall be considered legal, unless it be taken
from a with whom we are at war ;
then there (hall be taken, merely for form's
fake, a piocefs verbal in the port into which
e the prize (hall be broght.
e 4. Prizes taken beyond the said distance
x (hall be considered as made on the high seas,
y and judged by the tribunal of the captor.
r 5. Prizes made on the high seas, and bro't
t ,into the ports of our dominions, cannÂ»t be
f fold if they consist of prohibited merchanr
a dize ; but if they are not of this defcriplion
e the laK (hall be permitted upon paying the
t legal duties.
J 6. When the prizes made without the
3 territorial diilance (hall be carried into our
ports, a iimple process verbal (hall be taken
of the capture by the agents of the captor,
' and the governoi of the port ; so that the
persons interested may,notwithftandingthefe

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
, . .
TUESDAY DECEMBER 12. in
Debate on a Motion for fu [pending the opera- so
t'-ou'rif ail Act of Limitation. I'
The house having resolved itfelf into a com- h:
mittes of the whole on the fubjeft, Mr. cl
Dent in the. chair, the following report fi<
was read : p:
The committee of claims, who were " in- oj
ftrufted to enquire into, and report on tl
the expediency or inexpediency of defig- fe
Bating certain claims against the United tl
' States, to fee excepted, from the operation
of the afts of limitation-," âReport n-
THAT io obedience to the orders of the tl
house, they have made all the enquiries h
which to them appear ncceffary : that they ft
have attentively and deliberately considered e
the fubjeft referred to them, and are of o- 1
pinion that it would not be expedient to de- ti
fignateÂ«any species of claims against the U- tl
nited States, wfhich are now affefted by the i
afts of limitation, to be excepted from the I
operation of those afts. ti
In con Tidy ing this fubjeft, a review of v
the fituatwn' of the United States', as res- a
pefted their finance*, during the period
when most of the demands originated, was c
requifite.âlt was also Beeeffary to ascertain o
what meafurts had been adopted by con- t
grefs, both under the old and Â«nder the c
present government, tobring all the demands c
against the Hates, to a liquidation and set- {
tlcment. s
It will be recollefted, that at the com- ;
mencement of the war, the United States
were deflitute of money ; and during a long I
period of years afterwards, were obliged to I
rely principally on credit for carrying on all 1
their important operations. <
Having, at that time, no fettled national <
government, a regular system for conduft- '
ing public bufineu, especially money tranf- j
aftions, depending on credit, was not to be i
expefte*}. 1
Great numbers of individuals were neces
sarily inveftcd with the powers of bindÃig
the public by their contrasts. Almost tve-
ry officer of the army, whether in the com
missary's department, or otherwise, in dif
ferent stages of th*' had it in their pow
er to contjaft debts legally or equitably
binging upon the United State 4. We find
congress, at various times, during the war
endeavoring to make arrangements which
should prevent an undue usÂ« of the powers
veiled in individuals, and the dangerous
ronfeqowttes so winch the government w.ir,
thereby neceffarlly espofed. The afts of
the Jth of March, 1779, and of the 23d of
August, 1780, were calculated to limit the
public refpoufibility in such cases. After
the peace, and under the old government,
periods were preferibed, within whichclaims
of certain descriptions, and finally all unli
quidated claims were to be exhibited for .
settlement, or to be forever thereafter bar
red.
It must be acknowledged by all, that du
ring tbofe periods, every 'provision which
could rationally have been expefted, was
made for the accommodation of individuals
having claims against the public, to enable
them to obtain proper settlements of their
demands. The journals of congress under
' the confederation will abundantly juftify
this remark.
1 Commiffioiiers were appointed, with fper
cial or general powers, to fettle the claims
I of individuals in all the departments ; and
in every inftanee, the powers given were ple
' nary and explicit. ..Sufficient time was giv
* en one to obtain information, and
pin fne liis remedy, and ample opportunity
' wa3 given For all tofubftailtiate their claims,
or, at least, to present abflrafts of them,
which would have prevented their being
" foreclofed by the afts designed eventually to
1 operate upon them. The cases cannot be
' numerous, in which tlie want of opportuni
ty to bring forward claims, can be justly
s pleaded as an extufc for the omission.
By the aftof the 17th of March, 1785*
I all persons having unliquidatedclaims against
r the United States were required, within
' twelve months,to exhibit particular abllrafts
of such claims, "to some of the commissioners
s in the state in which they refpeftively refid-
II ed, who were sent and empowered to fettle
~ accounts against 'the United States, under
s the penalty or condition, that accounts not
so presented, should be thereafter fettled
only at the Treasury.
e By another aft of Congress, of the fame
! Â» year, viz. November 2, 1785, all persons
having claims for services performed in the
I military department, were direfted to exhi
e bit the fame for liquidation, to the commis
sioners of arms account?, on or before, the
II firft day of Anguft, then ensuing. By that
e aft if w*b esprlrfsly/eiolved,
under the description abovÂ£ mentioned,
e which might be exhibited jifter that period,
lr should be forever thereafter precluded from
â¢ adjustment and allowance.
r ' And it was provided, by the aft of July,
e | 23, 1787, that all persons having unliqui-
[ e j dated claims against the United States, per-
I taining to the late commissaries, quarter
i mailers, hospital, clothiers or marine de
partment, fhciuld exhibit particular abflrafts
of such claims, to the proper cornmiflioner
3 appointed --o fettle the accounts of those de-
parlrfleHts, within eight months from the! limi
date'of the said aft; and all persons having! thai
other unliquidated claims againil; the United the
States, were to exhibit particular abflrafts r ,
thereof to the Comptroller of the Tteafury req
of the United States, within one year from aft
the date thereof? and all accounts not exhi- ticti
bited as aforef iid, wire to be precluded from of
settlement or allowanee. frd
These regulations were adopted by Con
gress, under the old government. Great res
care was taken to have them extensively are
published, so that every individual, who was pa'
interested, miifht be informed of their exist- sol
I Â® .
ence and operation.
Under the preirrit constitution, there has fir
not been wanting a disposition to relieve wi
certain individuals vvbofe clainrs were con- to
iidered as peculiarly meritorious, which had mi
been affefted by the afts above recited. ho
With this view, in March 1792, two fe-
vera! acts of Congress were pailed, suspend- pa
ing, for two years, the operation of there- to
folrtions of Congress, of November 2d, th
1785, and July 27th, I 787, so far as they
had barred or might be construed to bar the ha
claims of the wido wor orphans of any of- m
ficer of the late army, to the seven years half nc
pay of such officer ; or the claims of any hi
officer, foldicr, artificer, fador, and marine, of
the army of the United Â§tntes, for pcrfonal pc
services rendered to the United States, in fu
the military or naval departments. tc
In consequence of these suspensions, ma- tl
ny claims were exhibited and allowed againil m
the government. There is reason to appre- ol
hend, in some instances, the public were de- u
frauded for want of pre-existing checks and p
evidences of payment having been made.â ci
This suspension continued for the term of n
two years, which was till March 1794. In a
the mean time, viz. on the 12th of February t!
1793, the aft " relative to claims afairjl the ft
United States, not barred by any aH of limitn e
tion, and which had not been already adjujledr
was patted by Congress, after a ferioti3 utd h
attentive consideration of the fuhjeft. I
By that law, it was provided, " That all I
claims upon the United States, for services I
or supplies, or for' other cause, matter or t
â  thing, furnifhed or done, prsvious to the 4th f
â¢ day of March, 1789, whether founded upon 1
i certificates or other written documents from t
- public officers, or otherwise, which had not 1
already been barred by any aft of limitation, t
â  and which should not be presented at the \
s Treasury, before the firft day of May 179/, t
r should forever after be barred and precluded ]
j from settlement or allowance." But this Â«
1 was not to coaftrued as affefting Loan Office 1
certificates, certificates of final settlements, in- j
1 dents of interejl, balances entered in the books of 1
- the regijler of the treasury, regijlered certificafes, 1
- foreign loans, or certificates ijfued under the aS
e mating provifton for the public debt <f the Unit- \
ed States."
One otheraft, palled the 3d day of March,
5 '795. provided, that Lean-Office certificates,
â - final fiettkmfnts, and indents of _ interefi, then
1- outstanding, (hould be presented at the office
*- of the auditor to the treasury, on or before
â¢- the firft day of January, in the present year,
y 1797,'0r be forever after barred or preclud
d ed from settlement or allowance,
ir This summary contains a geueral view of
h the principal afts of limitation, by which
rÂ» claims against the public nave been affefted.
is From an attentive t'ncm,
is ;fh3oF lie cfrcumftauces undfcr which the,
>f were enafted, the committee are fully im
>f pressed with an opinion, that it would no;
ie be expedient to suspend their operation.
:r It was essential to the public admimitn
t, tion, that the extent of jull demands upon
is the government, (hould be, within a reafona
i. ble period, definitely ascertained. It was
jr essential to the public fafety and to right, iii
r- reliion to the whole community, that all
unsettled claims should be made known
i- within a time when there were yet means of
â¢h proper invelligation, and after which the
as public responsibility should terminate ; and
Is the poffibiiity of charging the government
le by collusive and fiftitious contrasts, should
ir be at an end.
;r Thejuftice as well as policy of aftjÃ of
fy limitation, under such circumstances, cannot
be doubted
t. The situation of no country ever prefent
ns ed a more clear necessity fÂ»r, er a more com
id peteot juflification of precautions of that
e- nature. And all the reasons for adopting
v- them operate to recommend unufujl cantion
id in departing from them, with.the addition
ty aTforce of this circumfiance, that the fubfe
is, quent lapse of time has increased the difficul
ri, ties of a due examination,
ig The accounts of a confiderablc number
to of officers, who had in their power to bind
be the public by their contrasts, and who were
ii- entrulled with large sums of money for ful
ly filling, their engagement, remain unsettled;
some of those persons are dead : others
j, have afcfconded ; the business has been con
ift dufttd by others, with so little order, as to
in put it out of their power to 1 render a proper
Eta flatement of their tranfadlions ; the books
;rs andpapersof others, whofiadextenfivetrufts,
d- have been deflroyed, so as to preclude the,
:1c poffibiiity of settlement. Hence it mull
ler appear that the government would,in a great
ot number of cafe 3, be deflitute of the means
ed of repelling unfounded and even fatisfied
claims for want of documents and vouchers,
Tte which could only have resulted from a due
ns settlement with thole officers, and from the
he poffeflion of their books and papers,
hi- It might be inferred wi.hout proof, and 1
if- it lias appeared in the Otirfe of business at
he the treafury,*that it was a praftice with cer
lat tain public officers, on obtaining supplies to
as,, give receipts and certificates for them, and
;d, when jAy made payments, cither partially
id, or totfwy, to take diftinft receipts from the
>m parties, without either endorsing the pay
ments upon the orignal vouchers, or requir
ily. ing a farrender of them,
ui- Hence it would often happen that par
er- ties could produce fatisfaftory vouchers of
ter their having performed services, and furnifh
-2- ed supplies, for which, though fatisfaftion
fts may have been made, the evidences of it
ner would not be in the poffeflion of thegovern
de- metit. And hence, from relaxations of the
limitation a&s, there would be great da.iger
that much more injustice would be done to
the United States,than justice to individuals.
The principles, of felf defence therefore
require, and juftify an adherence to thofc
afts * t "rurally ; and there are not any par
ticular species of claims, Which, in tlk view
of the committee, ought to be exempted
frotn their operation. Â«
Thole which have been mod frequently
referred to by some members of the house,
are such claims as include the arrearages of
pay aiid other emoluments to officers and
soldiers of the late arrtiy, &c.
Pursuant to an order of the house, at the
firft. session of the last congress,. a report
was made to them, having special refere*ce
to this fubjeft. It wis considered in com
mittee of the whole, and agreed" to fcy life
house, on the firft day of February, 1796.
âTo that report and the documents accom
panying the fame, the committee ask leave
to refer the house, and refpeftfully fubnait
the whole fubjeft to their confideratioo.
Mr. D. Foster said, the Report itfelf
had stated the reasons of the Committee for
miting it, so fully, that he thought it
neceflary to do more than move that the
house concur with it.
Mr. Gallatin observed, that this re-
I port went upon two principles ; firft, that
fufiicient time had been given for claimants
to come inland that therefore it was always
â  I the fault of themselves, if their claims were
j not allowed ;i and the other was, the danger
â  I of fraud that would attend thefettlement of
â  I unliquidated accounts, from the want ofpr.o
---11 per checks. Taking it forgrantei that the
â¢ I committee of the whole would eoncur in the
f I report, he fnould make a motion to except
1 I a class of claims which did not come within
r I the operation of these objeftions, to the pof
? I feffor of which, due notice had not been giv^
J en of their being barred, and which were qi
' I ready liquidated. The dtferiptien which
i I he alluded to were Land-Ofnce Certificates,
I Final Settlements, _ and indents of iSterejj.
I I It was to be observed that on the 12th <)f
s I February 1793, an Act was pasTed relative
r 1 to claims, which required them to be pre
li I fented at the Treasury before the 1 ft of May
n I 1794, or they would be forever barred, but
n I these descriptions of claims were excepted,
t | Public notice was given of this ait, so that
1,1 the country might become well acquainted
e I with it. But an ait had been passed on
,1 the 3d of March, 1795, making further
a | provilion for the support of Public Credit,
is I and the of the Public Debt, which
:t I was a long aft, relating to different ob
-1-1 jests refpefting the Public Debt; but in tl e
7/1 middle of it there was afe&ion inferte*?, re
s, I quiring all Loan-Offiee Certificates, Final
81 Settlements, and Indents of Interest,
1-1 funded within two years. This aft 'Was so-
I reign to the fubjeft, and there was nothing
ti, I in it to lead to a supposition that fuoh an
s, I article would be found in it 4 110/ had the
â n I law been published in the newspapers, or a
;c I ny means taken to acquaint the holders of
re I this property with it. He could not, tliere
r, I fore, conceive that it wa3 confident with
d- I public credit, or good faith, to pass a limi-
I tation law in such a way. He therefore
if I hoped the'law would be suspended, fÂ» as to
:h I give due notice to the holders of these spe
d. 1 cieÂ» of papT, that it was intended tobebar
-11, cd. He knew there weie strong objeftion*
I against fufpendihg A'fts of Limitation'., on
n- I account of frauds-end forgeries } but he Sid
0; I not think these of fufficicat weight to (jre-
I vent justice from being dose to this claTs of
n- I public Creditors. The provision bftrriilg
jn j these claims was little known. He himfeff ,
a-1 knew nothing of it, until he.had eccafoi 'o
av I take a sreneral view of all the Revenue laws
in I of the United States, when he met with it
all I in the middle of the aft he had mentioned,
vn I He was himfelf wholly diiinterefted in the
of I bitlinefs, as he did not know -an individual
he I who was poflefled of a Certificate of this
nd I kind. How many there were, he knew
:nt I not, or how much danger there might be iÂ«
ild I 'he suspension he could not tell: but he wa*
I ftruek with the injullice of thus barring this
of I defcriptron of claims. He, therefore, pro
lot I posed the following Resolution for the adop-
I'tion of the Committee :
tit- " Refplved, That so much of an Aft en
m- titled an Aft making further provilion for
iat fupportmg Public Credit, and for reducing
II g the Public Debt, palled March 3, 1795, as
on bars from settlement, after a limited time,
jn- Loan-Office Tickets, Final settlements, and
fe- ItideflTS of Interest; be suspended for a ccr
ul- tain time." '
Mr. N. Smith allowed that the gentle
-ser man from Pennfylvanfa had fhevvn to his fo
nd tisfaftion that it wouldhave been much more
ere proper to have had flic law in
ul- "diftinft aft, than in the aft In which it
d ; been introduced; &he rÂ«grettedthat thatgen
ers tleman had not been fuffieientlv awake when
an- the law palfcd, to have presented the evil,
to as it had pasTed the House since he was a
per member of it. scut, at this time, it pre
)ks fented to his mind a different qadsion. Thi*
fts, fpeeies of paper was now dead by law. To
the, pass an aft to reviv t and bring it again into
utt existence, was a very different thing from
eat aftiug originally right. That gentleman
ans had, however, not noticed the impropriety
Bed at that time, which he lamented ; bat could,
?rs, not consent to its being revived at this day,
lue which would be to encourage a spirit ofipe
thc culation,
ers of the cerÃfcites fro.*: any benefit, and
ind throw money mu the h:inds of perfous no
at way entitled to ; it. Here, said is a
set - species or paper deltfoyed by an Aft of Li
sto: mitation, not by aft, but by h
andi of an aft on a different fubjeft. The
aljy coiifcquence would be, that defigiiiug,_evil
the speculators, who may perhaps have iutereft
lay- enough tÂ« procure a repeal of this law, by
uir- tb Congress, will buy up thi*
paper for a mere trifle from pc-toiu believing
jar- it to have been deltroyed by law. The mc
sof ment this ouettion was agitated, the fpeeu
lifli- lation would have a beginning. He did not
tion know that it had already commenced ; but
f it before the propoCtion got to the Senate, he
crn- doubted nbt that hundreds of persons would
tlje be parchafing this paper from perfoni whobelieved it to be of nr> value. - He was there-, w
lure, cippofed to the resolution. hi
> Mr.- Brookes could not agree with the w
gentleman just fat down. He seconded the fa
motion, because he thought it at once clear gi
and reafqnabl?. He washjmfelf no ways in- w
- t ere (ted in it. These claims had been as
â¢.much .sett led as they-could he ; and he tho't tl
tbe law for bÂ«rringthem had not been made w
fufficiently public. Instead of giving light w
to .the people from the house top, they had k
Iplaced their light under a bufhcl. With re- o'
fpeft to the danger, to be apprehended from hi
impositions, he did rot think it great, as
the books which were kept at tbe public of- re
sices, were calculated ta prevent frauds, by vj
marginal checks, See. Indeed this f>;bjijft it
was so plain and obvious, that lie doubted w
mst t&e proportion Â«*Â«mld fee adopted by a ot
large majority of the committee. fu
Mr. DAVT9N. ( the Speaker) said, the gen- oi
. tleman who (poke last had anticipated most of f 0
what he had intended to offer on the fubjetfl. He
was going to remark, that this particular defcrip- , r
tion of debt did not fall within the realonlng of ln
the committee of claim, on the limitation aits, n(
and that the possessors of it eould have no eipec cf
tation of jitt being barred. In addition to the mar- t
filial cheeks of the ofece books, mentioned by the â 
gfentleman from New-York, there was also a check
letter in tbe hboks and on the certificates, whicb cs
rendered forpery almost impofiible, \fliat bro't in
thin particularly to his ootice, three west? before It
he came frem borne, a f.nr fo).'ier applied to him
with one of these certificates, and another ore
week before he set out, to gn something for them. at
He told them they were barred. Tliey were fur- 111

conclusion of the war ; that they were to have p
received tlieir pay from month to month daring
theirfervice, but that Rattling had beengvsnto
them till the end ef the war, when they rccdv.d 31

but known to a few only, tbefe certificates were I
precluded from benefit. He truddd this report\ (]
would not befanflioned. if gentiemen werr a
fraid of speculation, the proposed suspension might
'< Â»lv be in favor of the raal holders of certificates
who had themselves fcrved, or furniftied fuppliei. a
He Should be fatisfied with this. The gentleman C
from Connefticut (Mr. Smith) lamented that the c
law had been pafled in the way which had been (
mentioned. He jcined him in the lamentation,
and he hoped that gentlemen would join with these
who wilhed to provide relief to these meritorious '
men, âmen who were not in a situation to pet any
information with refpe& to t(ie law which barred {
.their claim, and who depended upen their daily r
labor for their fuppnrt.
Mr. Allen said, the gentleman last up,
had given them certain information as to
the checks kept in the' books of the public |
offices, with a view, he supposed, of influen
cing their votes. He wished to know whe- j
ther in those books there was an account of (
the fumi due to these claimants? [Mr. |
Brookes answered there was.3 faid
he (hould not the ijU?"again ft' tHe resolution,
but he fhauld wi(h to confine the benefit In- '
tended to be given to the original holders,
and not to give it to speculators. He tho't
the cafe of thfcfe people hard ; but eÂ«(i!d
n<Jt' {iibfcrihe to the idea, that because th*
law had not been published in a cerTain way
it ought not to be enforced ; since no man
coulij b* t6 be igsorant of the law.
moved to add these words to the resolu
tion, " in certain cases."
'Mr. Jfcid r tbÂ»t when a tÂ»eÂ» Wftf
prosecuted for a breach of the law, he could
not plead an ignorance of it ; btt this did
not apply to the present cafe. The law in
qucflion was little known ; it could not even
be found in the index of their laws. He
himfelf did not know there fut.h a law,
until after it had taken effeft, and then he
had good reason to know it. Last wiutera
certificate was given him to be funded ; but
owing to his being obliged to flop Â»n the
road some time, from the dislocation of a
limb, he did not arrive till a few after
the claim was barred by the law in question.
ijf the members, then, of that house were
ignorant of the law, how could they expeft
that persons holding these certificates (hould
be acquainted with it. He had also called
at the office of the Commiflioner of Loans,
where he <vas direfted to the Treasury De
partment, but received no information at
that office that the claim was barred. This
being the cafe, he trusted the committee
urould notrefufe to do aÂ« aft of acknowledged
jiiftice. As to the amount of these claims,
they were not ignorant of that; from the
accounts of the Secretary of the Treasury,
it wai 1,124,000 dollars. And to prove
that there was ar\y danger from forgery, it
would be necessary to produce instances of
this kind of fraud. The evil of speculation
would be prevented by the proposed modifi
cation. He trusted, therefore, as it was
called for by every principal of justice, the
resolution would be aeceded to.
was in favor of the amendment
and hoped the refutation would be agreed
to. He had presented a petition the other
day praying that fame provision of this kind
might be made. He held in his hand the
original acknowledgement of the debt, upon
which interest had been paid. The ceriifU
ca-tf was firft sent to him to'be funded ; but,
finding it barred, the owner of it had peti
tioned for relief.
Â« Mr. Co it hoped the amendment
rtot 'prevail,"as it would ruu counter to all
former laws on the fubjeft, and he trusted
they should not now depart from the prin
ciple heretofore adopted. He was, howe-i
ver, in favour of the resolution itfelf. He
was a friend of Statutes of Limitation ; but
hÂ« would have them fairly made. The law
in qufcftion could Tflot be fufficiently known.
Mr. T. Claiborne called lor the read
ing of the feftion of the law which related
to this fubjeft. If they were to do any
thing in ths-bufiuefs, he should be for doing
complete justice. [The law was read.]
Mr. Alcis had little'refpeft far perfops
who had obtained the pofltfiion of these cer
tificates by speculation. He wished qnly
to relieve the holders; but if this
were not guarded against, the evils which I th<
his colleague (Mr. Smith) had foretold," p;i
would certainly take place. It had been
said, that there had been no instances of for- it
Â£ery j he mentioned one with which he was co
well acquainted. of
Mr. Elmendorph trusted that the gen- of
tleman who proposed the amendment would th
withdraw it, when he was informed that it th
waÂ» the praftice to iflue Loan-Office Tic- wi
kets in the names of others than the real mi
owners. He mentioned ooe instance, and th
he knew it was a cominpn thing. de
Mr. Parker was in favour of the
resolution of the gentleman from Pennfyl- Si
vania ; but he would ratlver not pass it than wl
it should pass with the amendme it. He mi
wished not only original holders, but all
others, to have the benefit of the proposed of
suspension. The he said, were N a
originally negotiable, and he saw no reason C<
for depriving them of that quality. It was th
true, that in this cafcy the money might go in]
into the pocketeof a set of men who were w;
not very popular in this country ; but this
could not bie avoided. All limitation laws T
he fiid, were contrary to justice ; but, in
all cafe 3 where it was expedient topafs them, or
care ought to.be taken that no class of men ti<
in particular should be affefted by them.â w
It had been objefted to this resolution that itl
if it pafled, it would open a door to frauds, fu
and chiefly serve speculators ; but it c6uld
not be said that it would place the original lo
holders in a worse situation than they are at so
present, but in a better. He hoped, there- on
fore the resolution would pass, without the th
amendment. â¢ tli
Mr. S.Smith said, this fubjeft had been cl
so frequently agitated in Congrcfs, and the ci
doctrine of difcrimmation so conftantiy decid- oi
ed against, that he wondered it should, at fc
this period be renewed. It was fully tried 1
at the time of commencing the funding fyf- cl
tem. Every poffeffing a certificate,
Ix&re the claim was barred, had the fame In
right to have it funded, faw 110 re&- cl
son why they should now make a diftinftion. ai
He was in favour of the refolutiin, and vi
fhouldhaveno modification of it which would e<
tend to prevent speculation.
â¢ Mr. Thatcher said, thatduring the last, 1
and the present session, he had had certifi- "t<
cates sent on to him to be funded, by his o
eopftituents, telling him, they heard the b
country was about to pay its debts. He ti
told them, in answer, that they had said by o
law that they would pay nothing at all.â t!
This hit friends thought a hard business ; ii
since they were pofTefled of acknowltdg- J
ments of debt, which government had so- ii
lemnly promiftd to pay. This was, how- a
ever, their situation. He was, therefore, r
clearly of opinion, that these people ought fl
to be paid. But there had been a hue and f
cry raised by the gentleman from Connect
ticut, against speculators. He did not think v
this defeription of* men had done the mil- 1
lionth part of the injury ascribed to them, t
He believed" they were in the situation of a 1
certain other personage: for he was giving 1
the " Devil his due but he thought the i
old gentleman himfelf was often highly in- t
j tired, by having more laid to his charge than (
he was guilty of. He thought these <
* feme fpeenhtor* hatftione more good to the I
public, than Congress had done in pas- I
nrig >th< law in quedion. He wished 1
their conduit was fully and fairly examined;
he thought it would bear examination. Gen
tlemen fay, that since lad January (when !
these claims were barred) these speculators
had been buying up this paper from the
holders for a mere trifle. Suppose, said he,
this were true, and they had given an origi
nal holder 43. in th; pound for what he be
lieved to be of no value. Where was the
criminality of this? Was he injuring the
holder ? As well might it be said, that a
than who visits another in prison, and gives
him meat to eat, does him an injury ; be
cause he does this, with an expeftation that
heaven will reward him. Connecticut, he
said, was the last quarter from whence he
_ should have expefted such a doftrine. If
it were right and just that original holders
j should receive that which they have had pro-
I mifed them, he thought those who had Hik
ed the purchase Â»>f them, in the face of a law
' of the United States, out of mere compas
sion and benovolence to the holder, were en
titled to more. The only ground upon
' which, speculators could build a hope, was
| that congrefi having pafled an injurious law,
would one day be brought to a fink of Jhame
' for having done so, and do justice. Topun
ifh these men, therefore, fur entertaining
' this hope, would be to punish virtue with a
t vengeance. Theft odious characters, fpec
j: ulators, it mull be "allowed, he said, have
some good qualities ; for if they have not
conftantiy fed these claimants on govern
ment, they have at lead kept them from Jlarv
e tag. He (hould, therefore, be opposed to
the amendment.
The quedion on the amendment was put
I arid negatived, there being 10 vote 3 only in
favour of it.

Mr. Kittera appeared in his feat for the
â¢> j firft time this session.
The bill for suspending the aft laying a
duty upon damped vellura, parchment and
d paper until the 30th June next, was read
II the third time and pailed.
d According to order, the unfinifhed bufi
-- nsfs of yesterday came before the house j
j when
[e Mr. Allen' moved that the committee of
it whole be discharged from the farther coufi
w deration of the report of the Committee of
1. Claims on the expediency or inexpediency
1- of excepting certain claims from the opera
id tion of the Limitation Afts, in order that
y the report might be referred to the Secreta
g ry of the Treasury. His reasons for ma
king this/motion were stated to be, that sar
is ther information might be obtained with ref
r- pest to the risk there would be in making
[y the proposed exception, and also with rela
ys tion to the manner ia which the law barring
the claims proposed te bceseeptid, had been â¢
publifhcd.
On being infprmed by the Speaker, that
it would not be in order to discharge tbe
committee of the whole to refer the report
of a feleft committer to one of the heads T
of departments, but that the committee tf
the whole might be difebarged,- on the fur
ther consideration of the report postponed, ir;
with a view of tailing upon any Depart l -
ment for information, Mr, Allen adopted
the latter mode, and moved that the conli- 01
deration be ppftponed till Monday wgek. of
After a few observations from Me firs. G
Srookes, Gordon, Goodrich and Gelatin,
which were chiefly in favor of the podpone- ' '
ment, the motion wan agreed ta.
A meWage was receivedfronfthe President
of the United States, inclotfng tbe cÂ®py of in
a letter from the Judges of the Supreme IX .
Court of tlje United States, representing
the innonvenienceof theprefent time of hold-!
ing the Circuit Courts in the State of Dela- gÂ°

27th of April.âOrdered to lie on the
Table. â  PÂ«
Mr. Harper moved the order of the day in
on the bill for the rebtf ot the rwprefenta- cu
tives of William Carmichael, deceased na\
which being agreed to, the house rcfolved
itfelf into a committee of the whole en the
fubjeft, ar.d the bill having been read, an
Mr. Venable moved to strike out the sol- to
lowing words in the,aft, " end also in full pi
for any demand on account of an outfit for him co
on his appo'mtmcnt as Charge dec Affaires, on dt
the 20th day of April, 1790." He thought ea
these words a furplulage, and might do mif
cbief in future fettltment6. It had not been
customary for tbe United States to allow
outfits to officers of this grade, atid there- bi
fore improper to refer to such an allowance. A
This motion was supported fey Messrs. Ni- th
cholas, Rutledge aÂ»d Elmendorph. v^
It was opposed by Meflr*..'Harper, Gal- f
latin, aud 'Pinckccy; Â«n the -jrourrd that a p:
claim havfng been made so* the' -aHowanCe of w
an outfit, it was necessary, in order to pre- at
vent that claim from feeing hereafter renew- ol
cd, to have a elaufe of this kind in the aft. ly
It appears, that by an aft pafled in July, C'
1790, Charge des Affairs, as well as Minis- aj
ters Plenipotentiary, are now entitled to an 3'
outfit of not more than one year's salary ;
but Mr. Carmichael, having left this coua- re
try in the charafter of Secretary of Legati- fl
on to Mr. Jay, in the year 1782, and had Â«
the expences of his voyage and eftablilhment I
in a Foreign country (for which purposes
Mr. Pinckney said the outfit was allowed,) t<
it had not been tho't right that he should be C
allowed fÂ»r an outfit. A difficulty occur- tl
red in this hufinefs, whether Mr. Carmichael f
should be considered as Charge des Affaires I
from the year 1782, when he entered upon a
the duties of that charafter, or from 1790, 1
when he received hie new commission. If
he had been confideredintbis charafter from f
the latter period only, it was said he would t
have been entitled to an outfit j but then as <-
he would not have been entitled to full pay <
as Charge des Affaires from the time hÂ« en- 1
tered upoi ihe dHties of-*he office, ndr to ]
the extraordinary charges which were claim- 1
ed. The committee reported the bill, there
fore, agreeably to the report t>f~ the Secre
tary of State, allowing him full pay and ex- 1
traordinary expences, but rejefting theclaim
; for an out.it.
The amendment after a considerable de
-1 bate, was put and carried, 47 to 35.
' Mr. Venable then moved tofirile out the ft
' condfeÃion of the bill, which authorized the
' accounting officers of the Treasury to allow to
the reprefentalives of the deceased, at the rate
' of 4,444 dollars and 44 cents annually, from
1 the 20th of May, 1782, to the loth of April,
c If go, He thought the extraordinary expences
1 which had been agreed to be allowed of 8,258
8 dollars would be a fufficient compenfatien his
' extra-services as Charge des Affaires, without
' any additionalfalary, and his salary as Secreta
e r y would be paid at the Treasury, without any
* fpedal act for the purpose.
This motion yjjrs supported by Messrs. Coit
and Williams, and oppofed'ly Messrs. Harper.
Gallatin, S. Smith and Brookes. It was put
and negatived, there only being 24 votes in its
' favor.
Mr. Allen renewed the motion which he
n made when the report on this fuljea was under
is confide ration, to allow an interffl if fix per cent
1 per annum upon the amount whtch^wtuldappear
,e to be due, from the time at which application was
1- made for payment, until the money was paid.
it This motion was immediately negatived with
a out a divifon.
The Committee rofc, the House agreed to the
re amendment, and the bill was ordered to be en
it foffed for a third reading to-morrow.
a- Mr. Venable moved the order of the doy
,j_ 0 n the report of a Sele3 Committee appointed to
:o enquire whether any and what alterations are
necessary in the law, entitled " An A 8 for
it regulating Foreign Coins, and for other pur
in poses." If the House had no objection, he should
be glad if the usual motion for a Committee of
the whole might he dispensed with, and the re
port be concurred in. ,
Mr. Harrison hoped the report wiuld be
committeed, as he was not very well ftirfitd
he with it.
The report was accordingly committed
