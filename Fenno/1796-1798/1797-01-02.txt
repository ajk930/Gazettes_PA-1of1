SALEM, December 20.
COMMUNICATION.
" A f?w days since, Mr. James Burnes, a
native and inhabitant of this town, returned home
from the Weft-Indies, having fortunately escaped
from the Englilh. He was 'pressed by the Majestic
English ship of war, from on board the (hip Af
tfea ; of which he was 2d mate ; and was dragged
about from Island to Island, in the English fervicc
for more than 7- months. He was forced, by the
point of the sword, into several bloody battles, and
made to fight agairift the French, and because of
his unwillingness to aÂ£l in tht English service, he
.fuffered from them the mod Ihock ng crueltiesâ
at one ti-ne he lay 19 days in irons, and would
have been ftai ved to death, had it not been lor the
assistance of a woman that ws on board the ship.
Once before he attempted to escape, in company
of another Amcncan, and fvvsm to a veflTel belong
ing to the United States; but the mailer would
not let them come on board ; and rctnrniig, his
companion was loft, he fuppofec! by a (hark. He
brings melancholy and most painful accounts of the
of the Americans, prefl'ed into the Eng
lish service ; and of their perijhittg by the cruelties
exercised upon them, by the sickness, and in battles,

[continued.}
Mr. Harper acknowledged thaif"it was found
policy in government to keep a drift eye over its
treasury, but this watehfulnefs he said, ought not
to go to the rejection of all claims however just
and proper. He thought t::e teaacioufntfs of ap
proaching the treasury was carried too far in the
prefect iiiftance. He would ask what was the ufs
of society, if it were not to lessen the evils offuch
calamities as the present, by spreading them over
the whole community, instead of fufFcring them jo
fall upon she heads ofa few individuals ? He tho't
it the duty of government to alleviate such peculiar
distress as the present. It was said this would
!"prove a dangerous precedent, and prevent neceflai y
provifio.ns against fire. If they were about to make
good the whele of the 500,0001. deftroved, there
| might be some ground for the alarm, but when
] fifteen or twenty thousand dollars only were con.
I templated to be given, no great danger could sure
; ly be The fires at New-York, Bal
timore ;iid Charleston had been mentioned; but
j what were the means of Savannah when compared
j with New-York? Nat as one to twenty. New
| | York was rich enauah to bear her loss, but this
could not be faiq of Savanmh, all the inhabitants
of which were reduced to poverty and diftrefj
They ceuld not therefore get relief from their fel
low-citizens, and to whom could they look for pro
tection and relief with so much propriety as to the
general government > When compared to Charles
tofe, loss of Savannah was *as ten times tbtf
magnitude as that experienced by it. The lofspf
Charleston was alleviated by a fublription of thirty
thousand dollars fjom its own cjtixens, besides the
handsome contributions which were made in other
parts of the Union ; but thfie was no property left
in Geergia to afford relief to its fuffcrers. Suppul'e,
said Mr. H.- we were to give 30,000 dollars to
wards this loss, what would it be when divided a-
I mongftthe whole union i And yet it would be e
! nough to draw down countless blessings upon us
j from these objects of diflrefs. He hoped, there
| fore, the committee would not be discharged. 'It
was a cafe, not only founded in jufticc, he .'said,
but. appealed to the fineft feelings of the heart ; and
j a deeifion in't heir faveur wfculd be applauded by
every man, woman and child in the union.
Mr. W. Smith hoped, if the house refufed to
b? governed by motives of humanity, those of po
licy would have some weight with it; Savannah
was city, and if some afliftance war
net given to it, all the revenue which had hitherto
anion from thence, would be lyft.
Mr. Sitgreaves wished to know wlisilier it was
in order to move to reconlider the vote which hat 1
just been taken ?
The speaker said the present aueftian Biuft firft
be difpofej of.
The motion was then put for discharging the
committee of the whole, and loft, there being on
ly 30 in favor of it.
Mr. Sitgrcaves observed. that he voted with the
majority in thedecifion on the firft question which
had been taken ; of which he wi(hed to move a re
confederation. Very few qucftious he said, had oc
curred since he had been a member of that house Â»n
which he could not determine within hjmfelf how
to aift. On the present eccafion, he had however
fnffered a conflict between oppdlitc feelings. He
had doubts whether thejr had the right of appro
priating any money excrpt For the public frrvice of
the country ; at the fame time that he was convin
ced that if ever there was a claim on the humanity
of the public, Savannah at present exhibited that
claim ; and he mult own that his feelings had at
length, vanquilhed his doubts ; and though he o
riginally voted against taking up the measure, he
fliould now vote for it. He was not sure whether
he fhoulri not commit an error in doing this ; but
if it was an error, he hoped it was one which would
be forgiven.
The question was then Taken for going into a
committee of the whole on the ftibjeft, and carried
by a coivfiderable majority, there being 45 votes
for it.
The house accordingly resolved itfelf into a com
mittee of the whole, Mr. Muhlenberg in the chair,
when,
Mr. W. Smith said, he did not propose to fill
up the blank at that time. If the refolutiou was
agreed to, the sum could be put in when the bill
cartje into the house. He himfeif Should not think
of propoling to all the b!a:.k with more than fifteen
thaufaud dollar*. This, it was true, was but a
ftnall fuffl, but it would afford relief to the poorer
class of fufferers, and others could not espeft la
receive rhe amount of their losses. He should m >ve
that the committee might rife and report the reso
lution.
Mr. Hartley called for the reading of the aft
allowing relief to the fufferers by fire at St. Da
mingo. (It was read. It allowed 15,000 dollars
for their rslief, which film was to be charged to
the French republic, and if not allowed in fix
months, the relief was to be flopped after that
time.) / ,
Mr. Macon wilhsd the aft alloiviug a sum <jf
money to the daughters of count de Graffe to be
read also. He did not think either of them in
point. The fufferings of the people of Savannah,
he said, were doubtless very threat ; no one could
help feeling for them. But he wished gentlemen
to put their finger upon that part of the constitu
tion, which gave that body power to afford them
relitf. Many other towns had fuffered very confi.
derably by fire. He believed he knew one that
had fuffered more than Savannah, in proportion to
its fizc : he alluded to Lexington in Virginia, as
every house in the place was burnt. If the Unit,
ed States were to become underwriters to the whole
Ui;ion, where mud the line be drawn, when their
adiilaiice might be claimed? Was it when three
foiirths or fnur-Bfths of a town was destroyed, or
what other portion ? Ir furance-offices, he said,
were the proper fecuritieg agairift fire. If the go
vernment were ta cpme forward in one instance, it
must come forward in all, since every fufferer's claim
flood upon the fame footing. The sum which had
been given to the fufferers at Sr. Domingo was to
be charged to the French republic, and That given
to count de Graffc's daughters was in confideratisn
of their father's fervicts. '(The aft in favour of
count de Grade's daughters was read.J
Mr. Rutherford confidei'ed the obje& proposed
not merely as an aft of humanity, hut of commun
policy. Savannah, he said, was a city of a minor
hclpleft state, but being equally under the protec
tion of the general government wish the reft, and
having fufTered so dite a misfortune, it was entitled
to relief, it was the duty of the reprefenutives of
a tree people to afford that relief. . They were, he
said, a part of the gre<ft family of the and
when the individual dates were corning forward to
their relief, he trusted the gene>al government
would not be backward in affording its aid.
Mr. Hartley said, that the gentleman from N.
C. (Mr. Macon) had voted againfl both of the
bills which had been referred to. He knew no
difference between the cooltilulion of the United
States and that of Pcnnfylvawia, yet a vote in
their hoiife had been carried unanimously. He
thought the law for relief of the fufFcreis of St.
Domingo perfe&ly in point ; for, notwithstanding
what was said about negotiation, the diltrefl'ea of
these people had consumed all the money before
the fix months were expired., If ever there was a
cafe in which they could grant relief, this wis one.
Tife loft-i at New-York and Charleilon, he fÂ»id,
would bear no comparifÂ»n wi.h that of Savannah ;
they were rich and flourifhing places, whilst Savaii-
Rah was a small city of a new state, ami the fufFcr
eiÂ« generally poor,. He hoped, therefore, the re
solution would be agreed to.
Mr. Moore said the laws which had been ad
dticed as precedents were not in point ; for the one
sum we were ta have credit with the French re
public, and the other was in consideration of past
fervicei. The distress of the people of Savannah
was not an obje& of legiflatidn ; every individual
citizen could, if he pleased, fhetv his individual
humanity by fubferibing to their relief j but it
was not cosftitutiqnal for thejp to afford relief from
the tre.â¢ fury. If, however, the principle was a
dopted, it should be general. Every fufferer had'
an equal claim. Lexington in Virginia, contained
enly ioo houses, and all except two had been de
stroyed by fire. He should therefore move to add
Lexington to Savannah in the resolution before
them ; though he Would observe, as he did not ap
prove of the principle, he should vote againit them
both.
Mr.W.Saiith wished gentlemen not to endeavour
to defeat'tjie proportion before them by an amend
ment. He did not think there could be a compa
nion made between tfte distress occafioued by. a fire
in ft fault town and one ia a popuiow city. The
ds-'.lruilioii jf S .vantiah was -a great lofa in a natiori
al view, as it would caufca oonfidetable defalcation
in the revenue, and probably any muney they might
advaacc for the relief of the citizens, would be am
ply campenfated, by enabling the city the sooner
to rcftime its former impoitauce in the commercial
scale.
Mr. Venable did not fee the difference betwixt
the two cases which was so diltinguifhable to the
gentleman lalt up. . Because Savannah was a com
mercial eity, its distress, according to that gentle
man, was indifcribtble ; but whep a like fccnÂ« was
exhibited in a small town, it was nÂ» longer an obÂ»
jeil which touched his feelings. His humanity
went no where, but wheie commerce was to be
found. He asked, wither the United States
might .not as well lose revenue iu the firit instance,
as put money into the people's pockets to pay-it
with. Humanity was the lame every where, A
person who had loft his all in a village, felt the mis
fortune as heavily as he w a had a like loss in a
city, and perhaps more so, tince the citizen would
have a better opportunity, by means of commerce,
of retrieving his loss. He was against the general
principle, as he believed, if afled upon, u would
bring such claims upon the treasury as it vrs>uld not
be able to answer.
Mr. Murray thought the gentleman from Virgi.
nia (Mr. Venable) carried his iAea of relief toa
far. He had no idea, that that houfs, or any Le
giflatuie, could undertake iu maka individual
misfortunes. He was of opiuiwn, tkat the line*
which separated individual from national cases, were
very obserVable ; the one was happening every day,
the other felJom occurred. When a large town, laid
he, is burnt down, and that town is an important
fouthain frontier town, it is surely a national _a!a
tr.ity, and has a tlaim upon the liirsaariity of the
â country. It was not true, the claim was of (ych a na-
tore afr to* be brought into a court of justice, but
it was a calamity in wich the wiiole natioo fvmpa-
thife-
It was not only a claim upon the humani
y of the nation, but aifo upon its policy, as, b'y
reltoring it to its former filuation, it woulJ be able
to bear its wonted part in cootiibuting to the rei
vetsue ot the coun'ry, and would continue to < <irry
population, arts and wealth, to that dillant part aÂ£
the union. In cafe of war, he laid, Savan nab
vas a most important place. It was necrflary the
union fhou'id have a -town in that lituation, and he
coiild consider any money which might now be
advanced as given away, but as Unt to that toyvin,
which would enable it in a few years, to refiime its
former situation, whilst the withholding it, might
prevent its ever riling from its present ruins.
Mr. Kitchell was opposed to the amendment,
and to the refolutiati itfelf. He had doubts if even
they were to give the citizens 15,000 dollars, at
was proposed by the gentleman from S. Carolina,
whether they (hould not, instead of femce, be do
ing them an injury ; becaafe, if the general gov
ernment were only to give this futn, the Hate legif.
laiurei would pioportion their donations accord
ingly, and probably give much lefsthari they would
otlierwife have done, if they had not had this ex
ample before them. He had no doubt with refpeft
to the unconttitutiÂ»nality of the bufiÂ«efs: he believed
they had no right to give money for this ptirpofe,
BotwiiliftandiHg what had been laid on the fubjecl
âfor the con (lit ut ion, he said. was like Sterne'*
text ; it was moulded tq any form, as it suited dif
ferent vipws. He~(hould therefore vote againft-the
two proportions.
Mr. Page faidhe was opposed to the amendment
though if the fufferers at Lexington had .Herd for
relief at the tt.ne, he ihould certainly h;ive" voted
for granting it. He was in favour of an applica
tion to the general government, in fach calami
tous cases, in preference to any pihet application,
and particularly 1.. preference to any aid.
Mr. Har ley hoped the amendment would not
prevail. If-the loss of the people at Lexington
had been greater than they could support, they
would doubilefs have applied to the legislature of
/irgima, but he had not heard of any such appli
cation having made. He agreed with the
g-entiemati lalt up, that the general government
ought to relieve diftrefies of this kind.
Mr. Murray enquired when the lire happened at
Lexington ?
Mr. Moore answered about nine mout!)9 ago-
He thought it was the duty of the United State*
lirit to pay the claims which were made upon them'
by diltiefled foldters aud others, for pa ft services,"
who were denied justice, because they bad paftd
an aft of limitation. If they weretoaft fromge
r.erofity, he said that generality ought to be exlen
ded univcrfally. It was a new doflrine, he faiu'
that because a fufterer by fire did not live in a com
mtrcial city, he was not equally entitled to relief
v*nh the inhabitants of a city, and that thoagh
fnch pcrfons wVre called Upon to contribute to the
losses of others, they could have no redr-fs for
their own. i his fjerned as if favourite fpotj were
to be felecled upon which special favour was to be
shewn. He was opposed to all such humanity.
Mr. Claiborne spoke in favour of the claims (>f
the unfortunate fufferers at Savannah, and if
could constitutionally be done, to go farther thdn
15,000 dollai*Â«.. He spoke ps the importance of
the place, and called it the Slaughter pin of the
war. â¢
[ Mr. Harper hoped the amendment would ie re. 1
jetted, for the fame reason that he hÂ»jjtd all amend,
waits, which were brought forward with the fame
view with which it waÂ» produced, viz. to defeat
the original motion, be i eje&ed. He thought
every propefition (hould (land or fad upon its own
ground. â¢ He wirtied that of his colleague to do so.
Mr. H. insisted upon the diffimiiarity of the twÂ»
cases, and that the diftinttion of great and fen all
calamity was fufficient to distinguish the two cases, i
With refpedi to the. conftitutiooality of affording
the relief in quettion, that had already bee'ri deter. â¢
mined by the fevtrzl instances which had been quo.
ted, which were also founded'upun humanity. The
prefont cafe, he said, jyight jtiftly be includedun
der the head of promoting the general welfare ef
the country. Gentlemen who the conftU
tutionality of the present proceeding, had done ihe
fÂ«mÂ« in the instances alluded to : but, ftoce their
doufets-had been so frequently overruled, he hoped
they fliould hear no rtore of them. With refpettto the policy of the mcufureâSivannih, he saM,
was the only confiJerable port, except Charleston,
which the United Status had in that quarter. It
was fltuated at the in juth of a river which \water
ed a fpaceof country containing a thousand square
miles. The average revenue of this city was
76,000 dollars. Was not this, healked, anobjeft
of importance ? Was it sot an object to foller to
relieve the diftrefiis of such a place ? Many great
statesmen had employed themielvei in founding ci
ties, and fhvuld they not hold oHt a helping hand
to one in distress ? Peter the Great founded a city
upon a morals, and Louis the XlVth-attempted
to build one in the Englilh Channel. He trnfted
the American government wÂ«uld have more wis
dom than to fee one of her's fink for want of a
little timely affilVance.
The question was put qn the amendment and ns
gatived, there being only 26 in favour of it.
Mr. Baldwin said, he hi(l dauhtedwhether to make
any obfervatiÂ«ns on this motion, not that he was infen
fibie to the calamitous Htoation which was the caufeof
it, but from an apprehenlion that it might be thb'the
vyas top strongly affected by it. Though it ipight be
disagreeable to one to give his judgment and to urge
his opinion* when his own relation to the question was
different from that of others, yet fome'of the reflec
tions might not be ufelels to those who were to deter*
mine it. He was sure it wrvs not a want of disposition
to relieve the unhappy fufferers, that had or would
draw forth an observation on this occalion, but merely
doubts as to the powers of the Federal government in
money matters. The use of a written conflitution,
afid of that provision in it, which declared that no
money should he drawn from the Treasury but under
appropriations made by law, was very manifeft from
the caution which it gave in the expenditure of public
money, and in laying burthens on the people ; yet he
believed it-impossible to obtain absolute dire&ions from
it in every cafe. The ohjtdlion is, that Congress is
empowered to raise money only to pay the debts and
to provide for the common defence, and the other
puipofes,-Â«xa<slly asfpecitied in thegth fefiion. The
â¢bjeilion has often been made, but many laws have
patted not exadtly fpecified in that feflion. He men
tioned the private a&s before alluded to, the laws for
eftaklifhing iight-houfes, to aid navigation in the im
provement of harbours, beacons, buovs and public
piers, eftablifhirig trade houses with the Indians, and
fpme ethers, to (hew that though ttye conflitution was
*ry ufeful in giving general diredliooc, yet it was not
capable of being administered under lit' rigorous aftd
mfrclianical conllrudlion, as had been fomctimes con
tended for. He begged leave to a(k and ,to urge the
question, whether there was no poflible accumulation
ef calamity and diltrefs, that might be brought upon
fopae part of the country, which would juftify the
Federal Government in granting some relief? No
doubt the afual prefTure of ppvate misfortune is reliev
ed by the poor laws and other aiÂ£ls of the ftatc govern
ment j but, suppose a iiate belonging to this Union,
the greater part, or perhaps the whole, was fituited
â¢n an island, and that at once, by some of the great
causes which we know opeiatein Nature, by< tremen
dous convulsions and earthquakes, it was to be thrown
into such a situation as some parts of the world have
been, not only the whole property of the
survivors destroyed, but their place no long<4 habita
ble, would the Federal Government think they had no
powers even to grant them l'ome of their new land as a
pjace of refuge He was sensible he had put a cafe fa
Itrong that the scare mention almoil seemed improper,
and that the mind of no gentleman could follow him to
that extent. He only wifhedtoeftablifli the principle,
that there were porffible inilances in which it would be
the duty of the Federal Government to interpose relief.
Whether the present calamity was so great, and the
dillrels that p oper relief was scarcely to be
expelled trom the state where it had happened; was a
question which he mull leave to their determination.
He was sure thoy could not wait tor inducements from
the nature of the scene, er from their own disposition ;
he could not with to heighten the colouring in which
it flood before them.

In eight dates our worthy fellow-citizen John
Adams has had the unanimous fuffrages of the elec
tors. I his faÂ£t, in the eyes of the world, will out
weigh ten thousand obloquies which some have en
deavour dto cast oi. his principles. }n no state from
which intelligence has yet heea received, has Mr. Jef*
fcrfon received an unanimous vote.
jt is worthy of remark, fays a correspondent, that
the British papers, at no pei iod of the revolution, ever
teemed with more Iheer abuse of the adminiÃration of
the government of the United States, than the Jaco
bin papers do at this very moment. The ffteers of
tliemoft inveterate royjlift at Mr. Washington, one
Greene, &c. do not equal those now attempted to be
playedoff against the refpeftable personages whe have
filled, and now fill, the high departments of govern
ment. What must the world think of a government
which is thus traduced by citizens ?
It will be amusing to the public, to recur to the va
rious statements of thefaid to be expefled votes of elec
tors of President and Vice-President ; especially those
in Philadelphia.

â Moore, and from Blair M'Clenachan in his separate
capacity ; to which, by the laws of the land, all the
joint as well as separate property of the said Gentle
men, is, and ought to.be, liable. And whereas
it it clearly and tatisfa&orily ascertained, thai mr.
Blair M'Clenachan, of the {aid firm, has conveyed
away to mr. John H. Hujlon, his son-in-law, to his j
daughter, miss M'Clenachan, and to his fen, George
M'Clenachan, several large and valuable real estates,
as well at considerable perfocal property, in the eity

clfewhere, with a" view, as it is apprehended, to de
feat the Creditors in the recovery of their just debts. â
This is, therefore, to forewarn all peffons whomfo

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public prints,
warning all petfons agaiafl purrhafwg from the
grantee* of Blair M'Clenachaii, any portion of the
large, real and personal estates he conveyed away to
his foil-in law and to hi* children was the result of
a deliberation had upon the fubjeift by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Cleoachan and P Moore as 01 Blair M'Clsna
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confidod in the fubferibers by
thofc creditors : a step which it would have been a
breach of dnty and honor in them to have omitterl.
The very ftalement of the fact therefore mart dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindiflive." it originated in a desire to secure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
went of his just debts. It was fan&ioned by the
adviee of council as a measure nccejary to the falety
of the creditors. If the advertilcment has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjuftiliable conduct, not to the lub
fciibers who have merely publilhed the truth iB
terms as mild as the {*& would admit, and who
Siean ro invefligate in a high court of justice the
â validity of thole purchases of whieh Mr. M'Cle
aachan so confidently speaks.
The fobfcnbers therefore are bound by a sense
if duty to the erediiors in general to repeat their
laittion against purehafing of those grantees or
cither of them, and to extend the terms of it ta a
purchase from, any other perfous (;f fueli there be)
to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
coaveyances.

TO BE SOLD,
A LEASE for /even \ears 9 from the 2 $tb March next, in that
â¢ capital and beautiful FARAI % called
PROSPEG T-H I L L,
' Situated within one quarter of a milfc'from the Brandywine
5 Mills, and halt a mile from the borough of Wilmington.
> 'T'HE* dwelling house is built of stone, two (lories hi 1,
* gentefly finifhed, and contains four handfrme rooms, on
a floor, beftdes an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
cellars It is geneially thought to command the most a*
> greeabje profpeft of the Delaware, from the source of that
9 livei to the Capes. This profpeft ia greatly en.billifhcd by
3 a full view of a vast body ol meadow, through which the -
; Omftiana and Brandy wine creeks are feed winding ir. beau
d tiful meanders. Near the house are a Kitchen, a fpacioui
e hone Aable and hay loft, a barn, a carriage house, mifk-
U ftoufe, &c. and a well of as puie water as any on the conti
,c nent. The garden contains an acre and quarter of land, a
n bounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, of
the very befl kind, brought from Maryland, and in full bear
ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a you'.r, apple
orchard begining to bear, and several old treeÂ« that produce
abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental trees, in
great numbers. The farm consists of near sixty acres of land,,
of good quality, and clear of incumbrance*, except taxei,
twenty'of which are now in excellent clover and timothy,
[e and ten more will be ready for lowing next fpriÂ»g. A re
fidenee of nearly 8 years has convinced the fubferiber that
IC the fnnation is remarkably healthy. The great post road
from Philadelphia to the Southward runs wjihin seventy
T yards of the house. In a word, the beauties and eonveni
, ence of this situation cannot be enumerated in an advertise
ment, and when examined, will probably command the at- I
tention of any person who isdefirous of living at one qntkc
1 ' most elegant country feats on the continent. The purehafer
3r may enter on the premif-S next spring, or perhaps, this fall,
if application be immediately made to Doctor NICHOL AS
WAY, in Philadelphia, to Do&or WH R I ON, otitic
or, in his absence, to Mr. GEORGE FRUIT T, in
Wilmington.
A quantity of excellent Hay, Grain in the ground, some j.
- Stock, See. may be had by the purehafer at the time of sale.
