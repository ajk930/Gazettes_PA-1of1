HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
DEBATE ON SLAFERY.
Friday, March 23.
The house being in a committee of the whole
on the bill tor the amicable fettlesient of li
mit* with the Hate of Georgia, and for provi
ding a temporary Government in the Miflif
fippi Territory :
X :â¢ R. 1 HATCHER rose, and said he
IVi Ihould make a motion touching the
rights of mam, by moving to (trike out the ex
cepting clause in the 3d seCtion of the billâ
[lt appears that in the ordinance eftablilhing
a government in the North-western Territory,
Slavery is expressly forbidden, and this secti
on of the bill directs that a government similar
in all refpefts to that eltabliflied in the North
weltern Territory shall be established in the
MiffiWippi Territory, except\hz.l Slavery (hall
not be forbidden.]
Mr. Harpfk did not believe his friend's
mo/ioo would be a proper mode of supporting
the 1 ghts of man. In the North-western Ter
ritory the regulation forbidding Slavery was
a vtry proper one, as the people inhabiting
par of theto..mry were from parts where
Slavery did not prevail, and they had of course
nd II.W:-ainonglt them Â» but in the Mifliflip
pi Territory it would be very improper to
make such a regulation, as that species of pro
perty already exists, and persons emigrating
there froni the fouihet 11 States, would carry
with them property of this kind. To agree
to such a. proportion would, therefore, be a
decree of 'â¢art'Jbmcnt to all the persons fettled
there, and ot exclufunX.oall those intending to
go there. He believed it could not, there
fore, b<* carried into effect, as it struck at the
habits and cuitoms qfihe people.
V?r. Varnum did not know that the gen
tle.nan fiom !>. Carolina wilhed to promote the
rightsutmaii: itions (hewed, at lcall,
that he did not fvifh to Support the rights of
ail itien ; for where there was a disposition to
retain a. part ot our species in Slavery, there
< <nld not be a proper refpeet for the rights
of mankind. It was true that this kind of pro
â perry is held in the southern Statesâbecause
they cannot, confident with the fafety of the
people of those States, liberate them, on ac
count of their very great,numbers. But they
cpnfidered it as a great burden to-be obliged
t) hold them. He hoped, therefore, Congress
would have so much respeCt for the rights of
humanity, as not to legalize theexiftence of
Slavery, any farther than it at present exists.
He believed the gentleman from S. Carolina
was miiirfken, in faying that such a regulation
would oblige all the inhabitants fettled in this
t rritory to .".move. The provision need only
cx -end'tw she forbidding ct slaves being taken
.âWhat, said he, is the litnation ot the
North-western Territory at this time ? Land
tlier.- is worth r?)ore than in some of the old
fettled' States ; "and he believed th'rshigh price
of laud, and profperotis condition of the coun
try, was entirely owing to ".he absence of Sla
very. . A'.vl if the southern States could get
clear of their slaves, the price of their land
would in) rcd ately'deubie. At any rate, he
honied the United States would prevent an in?
crjiie or rliia calamity ; for he looked upon
the , nu . ee of holding Blacks in Slavery, in
thib'rountry, to be equally criminal with that
of tl.e Algerines carry.ng our citizens into
Slavery.
Mi . Rutledge w'.fhed the gentleman from
Maifacliufetts would withdraw his motion,
not frotiv apyapprehenflon he had that it would
obtain ; but he hoped he would not indulge
himfett ,ind in uttering philippics a
gairtfta piaCll'cc with which his and the rplii
lofojvliy is at war. He submitted to the gen
tleman's candour whether it was proper, on
every occalion, to do thisâto bring forward
the southern States ,"111 an odious, light, or to
give his neighbour and colleague an opportu
nity of bringing thefu forward, and comparing
them with Algerines! He thought propriety
and decency toward otljer members required
that such language (hould be checked. He
believed, if his friend from MaflTachufetts had
recollected, that the mod angry debate which
had taken place during this feflion was occasi
oned by a motion 011 this fubjett, he would
not have brought forward the present questi
on. One gentleman fays, you call these men
property j .mother, you hold these men in
chains ; a third, you violate the rights oj man !
And :re not these men property r Do not the
people in this territory hold them as such ?
Did they not hold them under the Spanish
government f And must we thus address these
people t "We have madea treaty which puts
you under the mild government of the United
States; but niuli take from you your pro
perty : or rather, we must set your blacks at
liberty to out your throats. The rights of man
was the waWth-word of the day, and Congress
have determined that you ftiall not poffefsthis
property. They cannot, as yet, do Slavery
away altogetherâthe day is not yet arrived j
but tliev have determined it (hull not exist in
the Mrltilfip pi Territory."
These, said Mr. R. are not mere specula
tive opinions. They lead to more mitchief
than gentlemen are aware of; and he trulted ;
if the gentleman from Madachufetts could be
convinced that the difcullionof such questions !
as the present did much mifchief in certain I
parts of the Union, he would not bring them
forward. He hoped he would withdraw the
present motion.
Mr. Gordon thought, when the gentle
man from Maifacliufetts recolleCted, that by
the Cfiatilifhment of this government, the
United Siates do not cltablilh their cxclufivc
right to this territory, he would consent to
withdraw his amendment, as that went to fay
that we had the absolute right ofjurifdiftion,
and were determined to exercise it; and in
making a difference betwixt the ground on
which property was held there from that on
which it was held in Georgia, they would mi
litate against the sth fettion of tlie bill.
Mr. Oti s hoped his colleague would not
withdraw his motion ; and the reason why he
wished this was, that an opportunity might be
given to gentlemen who came from the fame
part of the Union with him, to manifeft that
it is not their disposition to interfere with the
southern States, as to the species of property
in question. With respeCt to the exiltence of
Slavery, the House had often heard gentle
men, who are owners of (laves, declare that it
is not tneir fortune, but their misfortune that
they.pofTels them, but who Hill keep them,
and claim the right of managing them as thfy
think proper. He thought it w-as not the bu
fmefs of those who had nothing to do with
that of property to interfere with that
light; and he really wished that gentlemen
v.Tiolield slaves might not be deprived of the
means of keeping them in order.
ff the amendment prevailed, it would de
rlrtre that no Slavery should fxilt in tjie Nat
chez country. This would not only be a sen
t/nee of banidimer.t, but of war. An inv.ne
il .i'e infurrertion would probably take places
md the inhabitant* would not be fitffered to
itt re i:> peace, but be massacred x>u the spot.
By permitting Slavery in this dirtrlft of cdun.
tty, the number or (laves would
creasedâas if emigrants troin Sout', Carolina
or Georgia were to remove thl ' s cullMry
| hey would take their i.-vesw,,!, them ; and
he could lee
l,ie ' Pb'unthropy or his friend. The North
we i crritory is inhabited by a description
of persons who have ngt been accustomed to
hold Haves, and therefore the reftrittion is a
greeable to them ; but the territory in question
vyill be fettled by people froin the font hern
States, who cannot cultivate the ground with
out slaves. He hoped, however, the motion
would be p'ertifted in, and negated by a large
majority.
Mr. D. Foster hoped, if the motion was
not withdrawn, that a long debate might not
be had upon it. *
Mr. 1 hatcher falu he should not with
draw his motion, and the more it wasoppofed,
believing his cause to be good, the more ob>-
flinate he should be in its fujjpor'.
Mr. Giles wished to fuggeit a idea.
The prefient motion was brought forward from
the avowed motive of furthering tiie rights of
man. He did notknow whetherthe tendency
ot it was calculated t6 ameliorate the condi
tion of the class of niÂ«n alluded to ; he be
lieved not. On the contrary, it was his opi
nion, that if the Haves in the southern dates
were permitted to go into tiiis western coun
try, by lelfening the number in those (tales,
and spreading, them over a large fuiface of
-ountry, there would be a greater probability
of ameliorating their condition, which could
never be done whillt they were crouded toge
ther as they now are in the southern. fUtqs.
Mr. Hartlev said, he hail bimfelf in
tended to have brought forward an amend
ment similar to the present; but on enquiry,
he found so many difficulties in the way, that
hewasobliged to abandon it. He found it
would interfere with, and be a feriotis attack
upon the property of that countty. He was
sorry it was not in the power of Congress to
gratify the wishes of philanthropies in this
respeCt, by doing away (lave'ry altogether ;
but this could not be done at pre(Vnt, and as
he believed the present amendment, ifcarried,
, would be attended \vith bad effects, he (hould
vote againll it.
Mr. Ga li. a tin. If he saw any of the
great inconveniences which were foretold as
likely to ante from thisauiendment, he should
certainly vote againfl it. He (hould be extreme
ly averse to the adoption ot any principle,
which (hould either directly or indirectly,lead
to the production of any commotion or insur
gency in any (fate where there is a great num
ber of (laves. He did not fee f#vv any such
effeCt could be produced by the present mo
tion ; for, notwithdanding what had fallen
from the gentleman from S. Carolina, it did
not appear to him how a regulation with re
speCt to another territory, can affect the peace,
tranquility, or properly of any other (late.
How the forbidding of slavery in the Miflifip
pi territory, could produce a worse effeCt than
the fame regulation in the north-vve(tern ter
ritory, or in Pennsylvania, or in several other
Itates ! 1 lie amendment therefore, could not
be oppofedon that ground ; it inu(t be upon
(omeother. Ought it to be rejected on the
ground of jurisdiction f Certainly not. The
United States intend to exercise jurisdiCtion
over that territory, and was there any more
reason for excepting this jurisdiction than any
other ? Ifweeftablidi this government, w6
exp?Cf it to be permanent; and if we believe
it is not conducive to the happiness-os any
people, but the contrary, to legalize slavery,
when we are about to form a con(titution for a
territory, its efiablifhnient ought to be pre
vented. But, if this amendment is rejected,
we edablifh (lavery so the country, not only
d rringits temporary government, but for all
the time it isa (late j for, by the condanf ad
midionot (laves, the number will inpreafe to
a certain degree, and when the territory (hall
beiome a (late, the Interest of the holders will
be fuch,as to procure a conditutiontf hich shall
admit of (lavery, and it will be thereby made
j permanent. Having determined (lavery was
bad policy for the north-wedern territory, he
saw no reason fur a contrary determination
with respect rothi6 territory.
1 here was, then, only one folitafy objection
to the amendment, and that might easily be
obviated. It was with respeCt-to the fitua
â¢ion of people already fettled there who are
polleffed of llaves. It would be extremely
impolitic and unjust to declare by ordinance
that the people fettled there, either under the
British, Spanidi, or Georgia governments,
(hould be deprived of this kind of propeity ;
and if this w'as the effect of the amendment,
he would vote against it. Such a regulation
would be attended with the word of conse
quences ; but other words may be ea(ily in
troduced to guarantee the property of the per
sons already fettled there.
By the laws of the different (fates, Mr. G.
said, the importation of (laves is forbidden ;
but if this amehdment does not obtain, he
knew not how (laves could be prevented from
being introduced by way of New Orleans, by
persons who are not citizens of the United
States. He hoped, therefore, the amendment
would be agreed to.
Mr. NicHo las believed it not only to be
the interest of the southern states, but of the
United Stages, that this motion (hould be re
jected. They were to legidate for the whole
of the union, and ought to consult the happi
ness of the whole. It was not for them to at
tempt to make a particular spot of country
more happy than all the relt. I fit was a mif
fortune to the southern (fates to be over
whelmed with this kind of property, he asked
if it would not be doing service, not only to
them, but to the whole union, to open this
western country, and by that means spread
the blacks over a large (pace, so that in time,
it might be fafe to carry into effect the plan
which certain philanthropies have so much at
heart, and to which he had no objection, if it.
could be effected, viz. the emancipation of
this class of men. And when this country
shall have become fufficiently populous to be
come a (late, and the legislature wishes todif
countenance (lavery, the increase of slaves
may be prevented, and such means taken to
get rid of slavery altogether, perhaps in con
junction with other parts of the United States,
who by that time may be in such a (ituation
as to admit ot it, as (hall appear prudent and
proper.
Mr. 'I hatcher was of opinion dire&ly
opposite to the gentleman jult fat down. In
deed they feldoiu did agree in fentinient : to
day they differed very widely. He believed
the true interest and happiness of the United
States would be promoted by agreeing to this
amendment; becatife its tendency was to pre
vent the increase of an evil winch was acknow
ledged by the very gentlemen themselves w{jo
are owners ot (laves. Indeed the gentleman
from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) had fiequent
ly declared in that House, that llavery was an
e*Â»i of great magnitude. In this respeCt they
agreed in opinion ; for he conlitlered the ex
lltence of (lavery in the United States, as the
greatest ot evils-*-aa evil in direct hoflility to
the principles of our government; and he be
lieved the government had-a Tight to take all
due meat ares to (tini.iiifli and deftray the evil,
although, in doing it, they might injure the
property of Ibme individuals , for he never
could be brought to believe that anindividuat.
tail have a riglrt in any thing which goes to
| to the dedruition of our goVefmnent, viz.
' that lie cap have a right in a 'wrong. A pro
perty in (laves is iottnded inierong, an<J n<;ver
can be right. He believed governmeht mutt
of .neceflity put a ilop to this evil, and the
looner tliiy entered upon Ihe business, the
better.
Mr. T. said, he honedly confelTed, he did
not like to hear much said in that House a
bout the rights of man ; because, of late,there
had been much quackery as to these rights.
But because these rights have been abused, it
did not follow that man has no rights. Where
j legislators are freely cholen by the people,
, and frequently renewed; where a law cannot
| be palled without alf.iting the intereds of the
! perfonswho pass it, these righticannot great
j ly be abused ; but, when we take iiiwn us to
legillare for men against their will, iris pro
per enough n> fay lonvething about the rights
of niÂ«n, and to remind others, who are fre
quently h<-.ird speaking of these rights, that by
nature these enslaved men arc entitled to
rights ; and on that account it was, whir) he
; made this motion, that he said he would make
; a motion touching the rights of man.
I '1 he ivafbnsoffered against the amendment
: by the gentleman from Virginia, were a little
; lingular. He contended that certain Hates
were overflowing with slaves, and if not colo
nized, by opening this wide traClof country to
them, they would not be able to keep or ma
j nage them. He himfelf always tho'ught that
colonizing these people tended loincreafe the
race, far beyond what it would be when pen
ned closely together.
Mr. Giles explained, by faying, that he
had said nothing about decreasing the number
of blacks, but of fpreadmgthem over a larger
furface of country,
j Mi. T. said, lie understood the gentleman's
_ argument perfectly, thoirgh he d.d not seem
'to understand it himfelf. The gentlemen
, wished to take the blacks away from places
where they are huddled up together, and
spread them over this territory ; they wished
to get rid of them, and to plague others with
them. But they had them, and if they de
termined to keep them, he wished only they
should be plagued with them.
We are, said Mr. T. about to e.lablifh a
government for a new country. Ours orig'iA
nated from, and was founded on the rights o]
mail, upon which ground we mean to protest
it, and could there be any propriety in ema
nating a government from ours, in which sla
very is not only tolerated, but fanidioned by
law ( Certainly not.
It was tifed as an argument against this a
mendment, that this territory would be peo
pled by emigrants from the southern dates,
who cannot work for themselves ; â¢ and on
that account thay rnuft ha'<e slaves to work
for them. If this be true, it makes the peo
ple of the southern Hates only fit to fuper
initttdjlaitcs. The language of this is, that
these people cannoifubjtjf, except they have
slaves to work for them.
For the reasons he had dated, he hoped the
amendment would be agreed to ; but if gen
tlemen thought those who at present hold
slaves in the territory should be protetfed in
them, he should not be opposed to their hold
ing them for a limited period.
The quefiion was put and negatived, there
being only 12 votes in its favour.
Monday, March 26.
The Speaker laid before the house a com
munication from the General PoftOflice, con
taining a statement of the compcnfations al
lowed to deputy post ma'der. for the year palt,
which was referred to the committee on pofi
offices and post roads.
He also laid before the house a communi
cation from the Treasury Department, inclo
sing an account of the receipts and expendi
tures of the United States for the year 1796,
five hundred copies of which the communica
tion stated would be deposited with the Clerk
of the house.âOrdered to lie 011 the table,
Mr. Baer presented the petition of Law
rence Averhard, a sergeant in the horse, during
the war, praying for compensation ;
Mr. Gordon also prefented'the petition
of Preserved Clapp, for compensation for ser
vices, during the war ;
Both of which were referred to the com
mittee of claims.
Mr. Brooks presented the Memorial of
the New York Chamber of Commerce, da
ting that the present critical and inauspicious
date of this country had excited geaeral con
cern, which concern had been much incre lfcd
by the late official communication from the>
President of the United States; that this date
of things called for the belt measures of de
fence which could be taken ; that the pre
sent defencelefs date of the harbour of New
York is such as to invite hoflility, and that a
place of such confequencc to the Union ought
to tie put into a strong poiture of defence;
they, therefore, pray that their fortifications
may be completed, and furnifhed wi-th artil
lery and military dores.âReferred to the
committee for the protection of commerce
and defence of the country.
Mr. Kittera presented a petition from
inhabitants of the county of Huntingdon, in
this date, dating, that they viewed with con
cern a flefect in the lawsof the United States,
which fuftered persons employed by the Uni
ted States, after they were discharged from
office, to publidi with impunity the secrets of
Government, and praying that measures may
be adopted to prevent this evil in future.â
Referred to a (elect committee of three mem
bers. This reference was carried 39 to 37.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of'
claims, to whom was referred a motion to en
quire whether any, and if any, what altera
tions are necefTary in the aits for the relief of
Invalid Pensioners, made a report on the fub
jeft, containing a variety of reasons to (hew,
that 011 the ground of judice and policy, it is
not expedient to any alterations in the
eliding laws on that subject. The report was
committed.
Mr. Sewali., from the committee on com
merce and protection, to whom was referred
he message of the President of the United
States relative to the depredations committed
upon a velfel in the harbour of Charledon,
reported that there could be no doubt of the
fails being as dated, and that it was another
indance to prove the neceflity of taking mea
sures for the protect/on of our coad. They,
therefore, report a resolution authorizing the
President to build and equip , eallies, or
floatipg batteries, for that purpole ; which
was referred to the committee of the whole on
the date of the Union.
The House again resolved itfelf into a com
mittee ot the whole on the bill for an amica
ble settlement of limits with the State of Geor
gia j when, after drikingout the words claim
ing under it, in the Â«tn section, and adding
two new fictions, the committee rose, the
Houfa concurred in the amendment.', and the
bill was ordered to be read a third time to
morrow.
One of the (eCtions was moved by Mr.
Milledlfe, and was in the following words :
" Thaufrom and after the cfiablifhinent of the
morrow
said govrtnment, the people of the aforefaid terri
tory, shall be entitled to, and enjoy, all and lingu
lar the rights, privileges, and advantages granted
to the people ef the territory of the United States,
north weft of the-river Ohio, in and by the afore
faid ordinance of the 13th day of July. the )' ear
1787, in as-full and ample manlier as the fame are
pofiefled and enjoyed by the people of the said last
mentioned territory."
The other, moved by Mr. Harper, was to
the following ed'eCt :
" That from and after the establishment of the
as refaid govrnement, it shall not be lawful for any
person to import, or bring into the said territory,
I from any part or place without the limits of the
, United States, any slave or slaves, on pain of for
-1 feiting 3CO dollars for every slave so brougut, one
helf to ihe United States, and the other half to the
person who lhall sue for the fame, and every slave
so imported shall be entitled to and receive his or her
freedom."
When this seCtion was proposed, Mr.
Thatcher moved to llr.ke out the words
'without the limits of the United S/ates, so as to
have mace it unlawful to have brought any
Have there, but the motion was not seconded.
Mr. Sewali. wilbed the House to go into a
committee of the whole 011 the bill from ihe
Senate to authorize the Preiident topurchale
one or more toimdenes. It was well known
the United' States w'cnf very deficient 111 can
non, which could not be got, he bel.eved in
abetter way than by giving the Piefident ihe
power proposed.
Mr. Harper wilhed the gentleman from
Malfachufeits to futfer his motion to give
way to one which he pro'pofed to make for
going into a committee of the whole 011 the
report of the committee of ways and .means,
relative to the appropriations for the military
edablilhment, as there was .at present a num
ber of officers in the city waiting tor their
pay, w' ich they could not receive, until the
appropriations were made, as the 100,000 dol
lars which were appropriated 011 account,
had been already expended.
Mr. hoped the House would go in
to a committee of the whole on the date of
the union generally. The House had re
ceived a melfage from the President a week
aga of a very alarming nature, which he tho't
it was time to notice. He was himfelf ex
tremely anxious to know what it was the ob
jeCt of gentlemen to do in this business.
Mr. Gallatin said, if there was au im
mediate occalion for making appropriations
for the military edablifhment, lie should not
oppose the motion of the gentleman from S.
Carolina; but on the firft of January there
was a very conliderable balance unexpended,
and therefore he believed it was not necefTary
to take up this subject at present.
Mr. Sewall thought, that if there was 110
balance in hand, their could bc'no difficulty
in paying the officers, in confidence that an
appropriation would be made. It was imme
diately neceflary to attend the subjeCt of pro
curing cannon, as the frigates could not go to
sea until they were got. He did not know
that they could immediately be furnifhed by
the means proposed, but he fuppofedit would
be necefTary to adopt such a measure in order
to feccure,not only the present but future sup
plies. As to going into a committee of the
whole on the date of the union, he did not
know that there was any immediate necedity
for that. He did not know that it was in
tendec(,to take up any particular fubjeCl which
had been referred 10 that committee. He
hoped they should fird take up one proposi
tion, and then another, until the whole were
agreed to ; but he thought it firft proper to
takp up the bill from the Senate, which was
referred to a separate committee.
Mr. T. Claiborne said, if a number of
officers were waiting in the city for their pay,
he hoped the business of appropriation would
begone into, as to keep them 111 the city on
expences was to diminifli their pay. As to
the Founderies,he thought it was time enough
to take up that subject ; he himfelf should be
decidedly opposed to the measure.
Mr. Bald win underdood that a motion to
go into a committee of the whole on the date
of the Union had preference of every other.
The Speaxer said it had ; but he did not
hear the motion seconded.
Mr. B. laid he seconded the motion. He
thought the houl'e had aited very properly on
this occalion. He was pleased that they did
not, immediately upon receiving the Presi
dent's meli'age, hurry into the subject, but
that they had taken time to refleft upon it.
He was sure, however nothing that he could
fay could fiiew, more forcibly than the meC
fage itfelf, its importance to the intereds and
happinefsof the United States. He thought it
was now desirable to go into the bulinefs as
calmly as poflible, ar.d begin to exchange
their sentiments upon it. It is a subject 011
which the citizens of the United States are at
this time deeply engaged, but tbey justly look
up to their Repreleniatives as having the
bed information on the subject, to learn what
is to be the ilTue of their deliberations. He
wiflied their anxiety to be in some measure
relieved by an entrance being made upon the
discussion. He confelTed he had never witnelT
ed a period which called so loudly for atten
tion, as the present. He could not remove
the fubjeCl from his mind; he not only
thought ot it when in that house; but when
he lay on his bed, his thoughts were (till en
gaged upon it. Indeed, no man who had the
good of his country at heart; could help being
deedlyad'eCled bytheprefentfituationoltliings.
He hoped, therefore, the house would resolve
itfelf into a committee of the whole on the
date of the Union.
Mr. Otis. It was well known that he had
been uniformly of opinion, that the House
ought, from day to day, to go into a commit
tee of the whole on the date of the Union, and
he was gratified in hearing the fame sentiments
from others. He thought the fubjeCl ought
not to be delayed. The motion was, howe
ver, unexpected from the gentleman who
brought-it forward. He could not fay that
he was prepared to go into the subject to-day.
As there feeraed, however, a greatdefire, from
what had fallen from the gentleman from Geo
rgia (every sentiment of which he concurred in)
to go into this business, he should be willing
to-morrow to enter upon it, when he hoped
they should go into it with one heart and one
consent. As the appropriations for the mili
tary department were pretty much a matter of
course, he hoped that bulinefs would be got
through to-day. With refpeCl to the motion
of his colleague (Mr. Sewall) to go into the
fubjett which he proposes, Would be in fub
dance to go into a committee of rhe whole on
the date of the Union, as it is intimately con
nected with subjeCts referred to that commit- '
tee.
Mr. Harper trusted the gentleman from
Georgia would give him credit, when he as
sured the house he had as great a desire ro go
into a committee of the whole on the date of
the union, as that gentleman, or any other;
but whilst he felt this desire, he also knew that
it was necefTary to pass the annual and usual
appropriations tor the military establishment.
As to the surplus which the gentleman troin
Pennsylvania had mentioned a.i unexpended
ort the fird of January, that had been paid for '
theferviccj ot 1797. He hoped, therefore, '
the motion forgoing into a committee of t|it :
whole on the (fate of.the union would be
withdrawn, until, this .business was gone
1 through ; afterwards, he fliould be one of the
. lad persons to objeft to it. Indeed, he re
joiced to find that gentlemen now felt that
anxiety on account of the of this
country, which every good citizen could not
help feeling.
Mr. J. Parker hoped the military appro
priations ' ouid be proceeded with, otherwise
it would be impofiible to comply with that law
which fays tliÂ£ pay of the army (hall jievcr be
two months in arrears. Nobody would be more
aeady than he to go into a committee of the
whole on the (late of the union ; he hoped
the house might do this to-morrciw.
Mr. Macon concurred inopiuion with the
gentleman jurt fat down.
Mr. Giles had no particular objection to
the. bufiaefsjying over till to-morrow. Eut
nhffl the Pre/ident sent his inefTage, it was to
be ixpected some notice would be takenof it.
Prom the bell judgment he could give it, it
involved the queliion of peace c/vvar to this
country ; and he thought gentlemen mult be
prepared to fay which of the two Hates they
wilhed. With respect to the congratulations
of gentlemen that others seemed noÂ» sensible
of the perilous (ituation of our country. He
confell'eJ his fears had long been awakened in
this respect ; all he believed were imprelTed
iwi'.h the critical situation in which we itand,
but there is a difference of opinion as to the
means of extricating oiirfelves. He had al
ways been in favour of every nece.lary mea
sure' for the defence of the country ; butop
pofed to all extravagant meafut'es. He ffiould
(till act in the fame way.
The other motions bring withdrawn, the
house resolved iJfelt into a'couuuittee df the
whole un the report of the Committee of
Ways and Means on the appropriations necef,
fary for the Military filUblifhuient, for the
present year ; when the blanks were filled
with the funis ediinated to be nece'lary by the
Secretary of War, until the article of subsis
tence came under consideration ; when
Mr. Gallatin moved to ftrke, out 25
cents per ration, for the purpose of inserting
20 cents, which was the price charged Ijtft
year, and provisions were rather fallen than
risen in price. Indeed, it was observable,
that the rations had every year beeu advanced
a few cents; in 1795, they were charged only
15 cents, lad year 20 cents, and now 25.
Mr. Harper, believed ra'* is might begot
at 20 cents ; but it was nect ,ry for the con
tractors to deposit fix months provisions in ad
vance in the different polls, which occasioned
a considerable expcnce ; ans besides this, it
was cudomary for friendly Indians to visit all
the pods,and whenever they did so, it was ne
cefTary to entertain them. He supposed the
additional ive cents were to make up for these
two eircumftances. It would remain with
the committee whether they wonld allow the:
additional five cents, or hereafter make good
deficiencies, as they found it ncceflarv to do
for la ft year.
Mr. Gallatin said, that there would be
no need to take into account the lix months
advance of provisions, as that was included
in the deficiencies which were now to be pro
vided for; and if a greater number of rati
ons was wanted, it fliould be so ex prefl'ed, and
not add co the price of the rations. And if
rations were to be provided for the Indians,
they ought to be put under a diltinft head,
j and not under the head of subsidence for the
officers of the army. In 1797, indeed, there
w as under the head of the Indian Department,
100,000 rations at 20 cents, which was the
j proper way of placing the business. If rati
-1 ohs could be got at 20 cents, and they were
charged 25, the overplus-would not go to t,he
purposes which had been mentioned ; but the
officers, who received money, instead of rati
ons, would receive 25 cents, inflead of 20.
Mr. Harper consented to the price being
fixed at 20 cents, and after a few observations
from Mr. J. Williams in favour of 20
cents, and of having the allowance for the
Indians mentioned separately, the motion was
put and carried.
It was proposed to appropriate 3,ooodollars
for three additional temporary agents, to trade
with thelndians.
Mr. Gallatin moved to ftrilte out this
article He thought there was as many agents
already aswete ufeful; besides the law confined
the expence in this respeCt to 15,000 dollars,
so that if these additional agents were to be pro
vided, itnwd be by a supplementary law.
Mr. Harper said, whether two additional
agents are necefTary or not, is mere matter of
opinion, and he .was inclined to take the opi
nion of the President and Secretary of War,
before that of the gentleman from Pennsylva
nia. Mr. H. in lifted upon the Presidents'
right to appoint more agents, if he thought
them necefTary.
The motion to drike out was carried 34 to
29.
Mr. Harper moved an additional item of
100,000 rations at 20 cents, underthe head of
the Indian department, for the use of the In
dians who visit the pods, which was negatived
28 to 27.
The item of 169,000 dollars for cannon and
arms, was agreed to be omitted, and consider
ed in the bill which relates to the purchasing
of founderies.
Mr. Harper then proposed two additional
items to make good the deficiencies of lad
year, which were agreed to in blank.
The committee then rose j and the house
took up the amendments reported by the
committee. All were agreed to until the
Quarter Mader's Department came under
conlideration, when
Mr. Ga llatin moved to drike out 200,000
dollars, for the purpose of inserting 150,000.
A great part of this expence, he said, was in
curred if transporting our troops from one
place to another, and now they were dation
ed, he thought the sum he had mentioned
would _be very ample. Indeed, he fliould not
have been in favour of so large a sum, only
that some vefTels would be necefl'ary to be
built ,m the Lakes.
Mr. Harper said, this appropriation was
included lad year along with tne Indian De
partment, Defenfive Protection, Bounties,&c.
for which 300,000 dollars were appropriated,
and they found there was a deficiency of
50,000 dollars. He could not fay under what
head this deficiency arose, but it was chielly
under that ot Quarter mader's Department.
As the edimate was 200,000 dollars, he hoped
that sum would be agreed to, as the Secretary
of War was more likely to know what was ne
cefTary than any gentleman in that house
c Juld be.
Mr. G a llatin contended,that on a com
parison with the expences of former years,
the sum he proposed, was quite large enough.
The deficiency of last year of 50,000 dollars,
which the gentleman had mentioned, ought
not to have taken place. 'I he Secretary of>
War was not judified in expending more in
these contingencies than was appropriated
(except in cafe of neceflity) otherwise the Se
cretary ot War, and not Congress regulated
the expenditure of money. It would be ne
cefTary to enquire into this business, and ex
cept some prefling necellity could be Ihcwn
for going beyond the appropriation, ltÂ«fhoÂ»i!d eonfider the Secretary nf War as !i -h
---ly VÂ»le for having done so, as the appro*
priation is the only cheek which the leg (la
tere has over thele contingentexpences.
.Mr. J. Williams agreed with the gen
tleman from Pennfylvanraih?t the expences
of the quarter matter's department ought not
to large now our troops are stationary.as
heretofore ; but he thought these objecti
ons ought to have been mniÃ in the com'nitiee
o< thewhoW; and if there existed doubts as
to the jnftnefs of the acco nits in tlpis bofinefs,
the report had better be re-committed until
they were examined, as the rwo gentlemen of
the committee of ways and means seemed to
differ fp widely.
It pall the usual hour of adjournment,
A motion was made to adjourn, and carri
ed, so the question on this point was not tak
en. Adjourned.

BY THE
' Pr"ftdent of the United States of America,
A PROCLAM VTJON.
AS the fafety and prosperity of nations
ultimately and efTentinlly depend ou
the prote6Vion and the blefting of Almighty |
God ; and the national acknowledgment of
this tmrh is not only an indifpenfahle duty
which the people owe to him, but duty
whose natural influence is favorable t<> the
promotion of that Morality and Piety, w *h
out which social cannot ex ill no J
the Bleflings of a Free Government be en
joyed ; and as this Duty, at all times in
cumbent, is so efpccially in seasons of Dif
ficulty or of Danger, when exifling or threa- j
tening Calamities, the just Judgments of
God iigainit prevalent Iniquity, are a loud
call to Repentance and Reformation : And f
as the United States of America are, at pre
sent, placed in a hazardous and affli&ive fit- !
uatitfn, by the unfiiehdly Disposition, Con- j
dixsl and Demands of a foreign power, e- !
v nced by repeated refufals, to receive our
Me (Ten gers of Reconciliation and Peace, by
Depredations on our Commerce, and the
Infli&ion of Injuries on very many of our
Fellfcw-Citizens, while engaged in their law
ful business on the Seas Under these con
lideraiions it has appeared to me that the
Duty of imploring the Mercy and Benedic
tion of Heaven on our Country demands,
at this time, a special attention from its In
habitants.
I HAVE therefore thought fit to recom
mend, and I do hereby recommend, that
IVedntfclay the Ninth Day of May next be
observed throughout the United States, as
a day of Solemn Humiliation, Falting, and,
Prayer; 1 hat the Citizens of these States,
abllaining on that Day from their customa
ry Woildly Occupations, offer their devout
Addiefies to the Father of Mercies, agree
ably to those iqrms or methods which they '
have severally adopted as the most suitable 1
and becoming : That all Religious Congre- 1
gations do, with the decpeft Humility, ac- '
knowledge before God the manifold Sins
and Transgressions with which we are justly (
chargeable as Individuals and as a Nation ; '
befeeeliing him, at the fame time, of his in
finite Grace, through the Redeemer of the
World, freely to remit all our Offences, and '
to incline u., by his Holy Spirit, to that 1
lincere Repentance and Reformation which
may afford us reafott to hope for his inesti
mable Favour and Heavenly Benediftion :
I hat it be made the fubjedfc of particular
and earnest supplication, that our Country
may be protected from all the dangers which
threaten it ; that our Civil and Religious '
privileges may be pieferved inviolate and '
perpetuated to the latell Generations ; that (
oar public Councils and Magistrates maybe â 
tfpecially enlightened & dire&ed at this cri- '
tical period ; that the American People may *
be united in those Bonds of Amity and mu-
tual Confidence, and inspired with that Vi- 1
gour and Fortitude by which they have in 1
tunes {Kit been so highly diltinguiihed, and 1
by which they have obtained such inralua- 1
ble Advantages : That the Health of the
Inhabitants or our Land may be preferred,
and their Agriculture, Commerce, Fifhe
nes, Arts, and Manufaaures be blessed and -
prospered ; that the principles of Genuine 1
Piety and Sound Morality may influence 1
the Minds and govern the Lives of every de- '
fcriplion of our Citizens ; and that the
Bleflings of Peace, Freedom, and Pure Re- 1
lijjion, may be fpeedly extended to ail the
Nations of the Earth.
And finally I recommend, that on the
said day, the Duties of Humiliation and
Prayer be accompanied by fervent Thanks
giving to the Beftower of every Good Gift,
not only for having hitherto prote&cd and
preserved the People of these United States '
in the independent Enjoyment of their Re
ligious and Civil Freedom, .but also for hav
ing prospered them in a wondel-ful progress

PHILADELPHIA,
TUESDAY EVENING, March 27.
ExtraSi of a letter from a gentleman in Bo ft 01
to his friend in Philadelphia, dated March
16, 1798.
" We have accounts from France, which
confirm the new decrte of the French, to
take all neutral vessels with British goods.
They have besides declared England and Ire
I land to be in a Oate of blockade (they should
i have added, by their own Jhips J and forbid
| den all neutrals from trading with them."
In an article published in yesterday's
Gazette it was said that there is not one of
ficer whose conduct in the late war will bear
scrutiny, who is to be found among " the
base hireling crew Â©f caluminating Jaco
bins."
Callender, in the Aurora of this morn
ing, has printed the above assertion, and
immediately under it the following :
" Looking into Congress we find many
refpettable military chara&ers Â©ppofed to
the present plan of war, such as general
Smith of Baltimore, colonel Parker of Vir
ginia, gen. M'Dowell and col. Gillefpie,
of North Carolina. It is needless to mul
tiply farther examples."
Has Callender the audacity to insinuate
that either of the above gentlemen are Ja
cobins ? Or is it " a precious conr'eflion" of
his employer Bache ?
A JACOBIN SECRFT.
Mr. Fennofays, " it may be boldly proclaim*
" ed that not an officer of the lead credit or rtfÂ»
" pe<flability, or whose conduA during the re
Â«' voluntary itrogg'.e wil! bear is now
" to be found among the base -hireling crew of

PROPOSALS,
BY THE
Ttifurance Company of North America.
For Insurance again ft Fire, on Dwelling-
Houfcs, Ware-Hoafes, and other Buildings (and
on Goods contained in such Buildings) distant from
Philadelphia, in the United States.
I. Common lufurancet, on hazards of the firft
class, will be undertaken at a premium of ahout
hall per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous
r.fqnes a larger premium be required, which
will vaiy according to circumstances, feidom ex
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; but in some in
stances, where the property insured is not airty In
irfelf extra hazardous, Wut rendered still fo
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buddings and
occupations, the premium demanded will be raised
according to circumftar.ces.
Houses and Ware Houses, the waits and parti
tions of which are wholly of stone or brick, well
con ft ru died, so as to be guarded as well as may be
againO fires from wi'hin, and tree from extra ha
zardous buildings and occcupations in their neigh
borhood, will be deemed hazardous of the firft
class, and may be insured ta their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not o' an extra
hazardous kind, in calks, bales, or package*, de
pofircd in such buildings, to an amount not ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; but if more than thisfum
is required to be insured in one tenement, an addi
tional premium will be required, in proportion to
circumstances.
11. lnfurances will also be made on building? and
goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to tho risque. But it is not easy to arrange these
under particular heads or classes, so as to describe
each with the necessary accuracyt Each cafe must
therefore be decided upon aceorcliog to the circum
stances attending it ; and these cjreumftances wili,
in general, appear from the defcrtptloii accompa
uying the application.
Buildings partly conftru&ed of brick or stone,
are preferable to those w holly wooden. And in
both cases, the stile of building, how they are oc
cupied, how they are fituatcd, the neighboring
buildings, and how occupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And with refpeit te goods,
their tendency, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, either
to commence or to increaft an accidental fire, and
th< it liability in such state to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden andhafly removal, or to be Â£Â«o
---len ip time of confufion and hurry, are all cir
cumfi-ances of weight ; and the premiums must be
proportioned accordingly.
HI. The following conditiont are to be under
ftodd by the parties,
ift. The Iniurance is net binding till the stipu
lated premium be paid ; but it (hall be deemÂ«d ef
fectual from the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately
figried or not.
id. lnfurances may be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
penses thati the payment of the premium of the re
newed term, the circumftancescontinuing the.fame 1
as they WCi eÂ»nderftood by the Tnfurtrs at the time
tile former insurance was made ; but the payment
of the premium is eflential to such rettetfal ; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
cftiriAg ftlcft time ; no'r can the irifurantfe be renew
ed Â©A the forttae* policy fctit by computing the
coromcn'ctnfient of the rehewal frdm the expiration
of the former tnfurauce. The fubjeA of iilfur
ance may neverthelcfs be open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. If a' y other insurance be made on the fame
property ; it mult be made krtoWn at the tf'Ane of
applicatior!, other-wife the policy fnade 611 such ap
plication will be void.
4th Goods held in trust, or on consignment.
jaay be insured as such in a fe?arate policy ; but
, they are not td be considered as infuied other wife.
sth. This company will not be liable or accoun
taffte for any loss or damage occasioned by any f Or
â¢ efgn invafioiT, or by any military or ufnrped force,
or by peafon of any commotion ; or dccafion- 1
! 6d by gunpowdvr, aquafortis or other thing of the
like kind kept in the building, or amongst the pro
perty if. lured. r
6th. Bills of Exchange, Bonds and other Secu
rities, Title Deids, Money, Bank and other pro
missory Notes, are not included in any infarance ;
nor are paintings, medals, jewels, gems, antique
curiosities, or mirrors exceeding the value of twen
ty-five dollars each, to be considered as insured un
less particularly mentioned and by special agree
ment.
7th. No insurance will be made for a shorter.
term than" one year, nor for a longer term than fe
vea years. Persons choosing to infare for seven
years (hall be allowed one year's premium by way
of difeount: One third of a years premium (hall
be abated in like manner en an insurance for
three years.
Bth. LolTes sustained by fire on property insured,
Ihall be paid in thirty days after due prouf and li
quidation thereof, without deduction.
A defciiption of the property to be infurod will
be expe&ed with each application, to be made by
a master carpenter and signed by him, as well as
by the owner of the building or applicant for in
surance, and attested before a Notary or principal
Magistrate, who will certify his knowleigeof the
parties and their credibility.
With refpetf to Houses and other Buildings >
lit. The site and pofction ; describing the
street or road on or near which the building
