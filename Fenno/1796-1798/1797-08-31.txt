The Eagle, (printed at Hanover, New-

among the geese in that quarter: the flate
#itnt follows :
41 A disorder something similar to the a
bove, we are forrjÂ» to announce, has of late
prevailed among the geese of this vicinity.
During the last week, the mortality has been
very alarming. Four br five have sometimes
expired in a night. Some appear to have
been ieized with a delirium, and have seized
cattle by the tail, and hung on till they
were dragged and kicked to death. Others
like the pillar faints, of the third and fourth
centuries, have, during the night, ported
themfelvcs on the pillars and gate-pofta, and
bave actually found dead there, in the
morning. This malady is by some attri
buted to the noxious quality of the water,
especially that of the pump in the college
, yard, which the geese have been aecuftoin
ed to frequent. This opinion is probably
well founded, as those geese which have
not frequented that water arc in a very good
state of health. A similar distemper pre
vailed here about a year ago.
What llrangedifeafeshave of late broke loose;

A wretch by the name of Haley, has uttered, in
a letter publ Ihrd in the news papers, a number
of sentiments which, while they excite abhorrence
at the turpitude of the writer, will serve as a use
ful ctavh jacobinica, to those who were loth to cre
dit in their full extent, the current opinions ofithe
malice and hiaekntf* of jacobin hearts. His prin
ciples are precisely he fame as those dilT mir.aterl
by Bache and all the other jacobins ; with thiÂ« dif
ference only, that Haley being illiterate had not
the art to disguise, like them, his infernal tenets.
Every honest republican, every man who hat pe

MR. FEN NO,
AS long as the Grange and absurd opinions, .
which at prefeist divide the community, continue â 
to prevail, To long will our capital towÂ«t continue
to become at times the feats of contagious difor- 1
ders. While the fe3aries of one clafÂ« of tenets I
ob.linately maintain that the yellow fever whene- |
ver it has hitherto appeared in this country, ha* c
been indigenous, their opponents as pertinaciously
deny that the climate can admit of its becoming 1
so each party at the fame time ftrenuÂ»ufly urg- '
iÂ»g an attention to one cause, while to guard a- t
gainst the other is deemed ufclefs ?nd futile.
A course suggests, ohviouflyealculated to meet
the opinions and wishes of all : That is, to i&
upon the convifhon that malignart diseases may be c
generate lon the spot, and to let the fnperintend J
ance of the health of thÂ» city be committed to 't
persons of this perftaarfion. At the fame time, let I
the officers appointed to guard against the intro â¢
duftion of infectious Jifeafes from abroad be en- 1
trufled to persons whs believe that contaginn may c
bf imported. Simple as this courfc may seem, Jl
the reverse of it has ben purfucd. If the yellow I'
fever be indigenous to this climate, surely our city, n
during the present summer, has abounded in filth 1
and nauseous vapours, Â«f every deferirtion, in a
fufficient degree to have created an universal con- "
tagion. A B. t

* To the Editor of the Auroraj
, j In answer to the Queries proposed and the
25 observations made by B. F. Bache ref
- 17 pcfting the conduA of the British Mi
' 6 nifter.
Query. "-Did not Mr. Lflon draw up
j t the pTan of the expedition againll the Louifi
, f anas and the Floridas ?"
15 No. Mr. Liflon never drew up or fug
-14 jjefted any of any expedition whatever.
J' He listened indeed to the proje&s of A
g meriean Speculators. He doubtless put in
-6 to writing what they suggested in tonverfa
â tion. And if he afted with prudence, he
19 exhibited to the parties concerned a copy of
what he had put upon paper, that they
"on m 'g^ t judge whether he had fairly and fully
10t stated their meaning.
But this is surely different from drawing
up the plan of an expedition. As well might
w it be alledged of yOn,Mr. B.F. B. that when
ide you print an account of the debates in the
in House of Representatives from the notes
which you scribble in the Congress Hall,
you compose the harangues members,
w- Now, though you may attenfpt to improve
he and embellilh the declamations of the patri
ta ots. and though you mutilate and mifreprc
ed sent the sentiments of honest men, it would
t'e- not be true to fay that you aftually draw
up their speeches.
3- _ The plan thus proposed to the Briti'lh mi
ite nifter, put in writing by him, and commu
y. cated to hisfuperiors (as he made no diffi
en culty in acknowledging,) regarded the Flo
ies ridtif, not Lou'fiana. The projedi of au at
ve tack from Canada was never thought of till it
ed was drawn up by the ingenious Knight of
ey the dillinguilhed order.
ts " Did not Mr. Liston take into
th employ Captain Chisholm and others, citi
i*d zent of the United States, for the purpose of
id carrying into effeft the said plan
le No. Mr. Liflm never took, never tho't
himfelf authorized to take, any step, of any
r, nature, for the purpose of carrying the plan
r e into effeifl. He merely communicated the
projedi to his government. ' â¢
[y
, e Chijbolm to England ?"
d _ Yes. Having charged Mr. Chi/holm with
t- dispatches, to which he was to bring back
the answer, Mr. Liflon paid his passage out â 
; and no doubt will pay his passage home if it
is demanded.*
Q. " Did not he [Mr. Liflon) recoin
mrnd {Chtfholm] to hfs goTertTfnfnrT'"
n Isr Â°* And committee are in poffeflion
â of papers which we believe tend to prove
that had fuoh a recommendation beeÃ alked
it would not have been granted. â¢
n Q. " Were not commissions promised to
r bthers, citixau of the United States ?"
c No. None were promised either to citi
zens, or ah'ens. What hopes may have
e been entertafned by sanguine prbjeAors, or
- what lflofe coDverfation may have taken
1 place among them in their moments of con
t" fidential intercourse, is a different question.
1. None of the number it is believed will have
. the assurance to fay that they ever imparted
= their golden dreams to the British minister ;
I and there would be injustice in rendering
him responsible for their extravagance,
r " And were not overtures made in be- â¢
half of Mr. Liflon to one person, if not '
more, aSually in the pay of the United States ?" 1
\ Most assuredly notânot by Mr. Ltfton's 1
â¢ authority or #ith his knowledge. If Mr. 1
; Bache would mention particulars, and fpeci- '
. fy names, confutation would be
1 the mean time the thing appears to approach 1
to a moral impoflibility. The promoters |
1 of the scheme for attack on the Spanish ter- c
ritory, as proposed to the British minister, (
seem, seem to have been of the number of f
those who call themfelvei the friends of li
berty, the affertors of the rights of man, the f
only genuine loverÂ»-of their countryand i
of course, you know, the worst enemies of J
British connexions. Is it to be supposed d
then, that a British minister newly arrived C
(for Mr. Liflon had not been eight mouths C
in the country when this business commen- â
ced) would have dared to make overtures to t
men of this description and those too, aftual- e
Iy in the pay of the United States ? Yon
might as soon make me believe that Mr.
Lflon hat the custom of thrusting his fift '
into every r hornet's nest he comes near, or
that he bounces uninvited into the meetings I
of the democratic society of Philadelphia, i,
No, my good man ; if any overtures n
were made on that occasion, they were.made n
to Mr. Lflon, not by him. Now, indeed,
that he has acquired a competent knowledge fl
of the principles and chandlers of the fafti- *
on, it would not be surprizing if heaffumed "
more courage and trod more boldly. For *
my own part I should not stare if I heard ti
that he had made fucccfsful advances to the M
most renowned of their champions, the im- Â°
maculate Benjamin Franklin Bache himfelf.
Q. " Were not overtures made in behalf fj'
of Mr. Liflon to persons influential among a ,
the Indians ?" al
Never with his consent or knowledge.
(X " And were not the Savages to be v
employed in the expedition ?"
it right to defray Cl.i(holm's fxpences while in Eng. w
I land. But if l'o, when we consider the difficulties P'
and delays that occur in the tranfa&ion of public 8'
business in old and corrupted countries, and the r )
consequent probable protrailion of his stay in Lon- '''
don, we fruli that the poor man's allowance will d'
be wore liberal than Mr. B. F. Bache fecme inclined 'h
to fuppoft it. (f&cn'y pmndi. J w
a This was proposed and objedied to.

ie appears from the answer he received from

f. No. A flight comparison of dates wijl
that this could not pofiibly be the
cafe. Mr. LiJlosi's dispatches, containing
the doubts which dafrined the projeft, were
f forwarded in January, whereas Mr. Chif
holni s departure (and of course the doubts
r _ supposed to have arisen juji before it) did
' r- no' take place till-the latter end of March
' or beginning of April,
j.
ment to declare, whether he knew any thing
Â°f s uc h an expedition, did not he (Mr.
Liton) at iirft unequivocally deny it, then
afiert that though some such plan had been
y proposed to him, he had discouraged it ?"
Here it is essential to make a diftindtion
which Mr. Bache is anxious to confound.
f t Â° ur government mentioned to Mr. Lif
â n tÂ° n Â» that the Spanish Envoy pretended
ie "an expedition was preparing on the Lakes
fw an attack on the Spanifl Pejls in Up
[j ( per Loui/ratia."
s ' The Britilh Minister made answer that
re Â°f nn fuck preparations, and did net
believe they exiffed.
c He said true. No such preparations were
~ ever made ; tib such expedition was ever
thought of.
w At a certain di(lance of time he is aflced
to f a y whether some other expedition had
no' b Â«en in agitation. He anfwfers that
J. another had indeed been proposed, (mean
ing the projected attack on Florida) but
Â£ that the idea had not been of.
it There is in all this nothing of contradic
' tion or inconsistency. It is the plain and
simple truth. S
, o A Â°d every part of your premises being
. thus shewn to be groundless or irrelevant,
your conclusion of course must fall to the
ground.
>t Your indecent accusation of the Secre
y tar y of State,, resting as ft does on the fame
n baseless fabric, is involved in the equal ruiu.
" Mr. Pickering (you fay) was early ac
quainted with Mr._Lifton's plan. He well
. knew its existence before he made any en
quiry of the British Minister."
Now it is impoflible the Secretary could
t h . avc any knowledge of a projedted expedi-
tion from Canada againfl Upper Louisiana,
for tfie plain reason that no such plan ever
1 exited. *
And he had no knowledge of the pro-
Jofrd StfaeLon _tha FWiiu, till tire- dlfco
very of Blount's letter: immediately after
. wh, . ch he made the enquiry of Mr. Lifton,
. which produced an avowal of the fad un
der the Minister's own hand.
Iri all this there is nothing but what is
proper, ,-and indeed meritorious. But I
feel that I must offend colonel Pickering
by stooping to defend him against your ca
lumny.
ALBANY, Huguft 15.
COMMUNICATION.
Various have been the methftds adopted by
the difafleited to sap the confidence of the peo
ple in the Government. They have exerted
their influence at home, and their influence a- .
broad. Their nightly cabals, and mid-day as- 1
foeiations, have proclaimed the rankling enmi- j
ty Â»f their hearts towards the admlnillration of ,
ourcountry: affiliated focietiei, in differ ent parts
as the Union, have fucceflively relponded to the
loud clamours of fadiionâand commiflioned fo
reign agents hive betH encouraged to insult thr
political Guardians of America, and to appeal to
tbepeople, from the decisions of the conflicted i
authorities.âlneffectual as have hitherto prov- I
ed all the Protean arts of the dil'affedled, afid c
notu'ithftanding the determination shewn by a
great majority of our citizens to continue their
confidence in those whom they have eleited to f
the management of their important public con-
cerns, there are yet fueh who do not despair of J'
being able to rendei the government odious, by f
anathematizing its measures, when they are b
sensible that government will not deign to make t
itfelf a party oa the occasion. To the lift of r
appellants to the people of America, is now ad- '
ded the nameoftheci-devant Plenipo to France, a
Citizen James Monroe. How much longer the a
Citizen, and his intended appeal, will livÂ« in thÂ« c
public notice, than those who, with similar ft
modes of procedure, have gene before him, c
time must determine. A few remarks, howev- â
er, upon what has already been exhibited by
him, may not be deemed amiss. P
Citizen Monroe, before he made his apptica- c
tion to the Secretary as State, well ,kriew that
the Executive would not permit an official ex- h
ploriation of the motives which induced his re- a
cal ; but the application he conceived would give T
importance to his intended appealâas thereby
no incanfidrt able number amoiig'the molt nu- r
merous class of our eitizens, might be led to be
lieve that a confcioufnels in the purity of /his in
tentions induced the step alfo that such
would entertain the idea that the reasons which if
influenced the adminiffration to decline the dif- li
cuffion, arose from a conviiflion that well found- w
ed causes for a reeal did not exist. But the
true reafoni for not engaging in the difcuflion 31
with Citizen' Monroe, are afligned in'the letter 0
of the Secretary of State, to the Citizen, dated â  S'
the 24th -Â»,lt. an attentive re-peruf#l of it is re- n <
commended. The administration would be fij
finely employed, to be fore, in disputing incesT- m
antly with recalled miniiters, suspended agents, as
and various difmified public officers.
The' motives which Influenced President
Washingto' to recal Citizen Monroe from a '
his embafly, were undoubtedly weighty; and,
that thÂ« measure was reqyifite and proper, few b<
will doubt who confide in the reilitude and pro- ta
priety which is attached to the character of that
great and good man. Indeed, that the Secreta
ry of State has touched the " gall'd bsrfe," in rr
his letter afiigning many reafoss which might in
duce the recal of a minister, is fully evident from
the ni.icing of the mortified " patrwt and
when the great appeal tÂ» the people shall be made
public, thsre is little room io doubt but that the
Citizen will fjnd an aiyipie detail of the reasons
for his difniifiion, which proofs exhibited that
those reasons havea b.-tter bafts than theinfor
rn matioii of " fpiet and informers."
While the French Direftory <were yet warm
lis with their orders for captuting American vef
te fels,4nd plundering the property of our citizens
,r hew dear Mr. Monroe was to their hearts is
manifefted in the speech of. Barras, a fpeeijh
which even made lome of the Gallio- American
members of Congress cry our, (hÂ»Â»u> ! Citizen
'd Freeman, from Maflachufetts, said the speech
:e Â°f Barras was Â£< more lilte childish gasconade
ilÂ» than any thing else." But the Frenchman was
m loth to part with Citizen Montoe ; he espreffed
to him that, notwithstanding the rrprehcÃfible
n. conduit of the American government, in their
minister was found a good fellow j this is the
-Â° meaning of his expreflion. Wouid Mi*. Mon
â¢Â° roe have received, as a compliment, an addrefc
which criminated the goyernmrtit whose agent
[J] he was, if h s heart had not beat (n'tisifon with
le the heart of Barras ? and is it poflible the gov
ernment could have confidence in in agent when
Â® agent, with all i\iefang fmid of a French
man, could hear abuie levelled at its measures,
and, with chapeau in hand, bow .affint to the
ts censures exprefTed ? Will it be said that this lalt
id mentioned circumstance was not known antece
:h dent to the recal ? Let it beconftdered aciite
rion whereby to judge of the previous conduit
n _ of the minister during the course of his mission.
Fhe fraternal sentiments of Barras were not de
'S livere.l as merely complimentaryâthey came
r. from the heartâand doubtless reached the
:n heart. " Iffueb ibingt were done in the green
:n tree, ivhat were done in tbe dry ?"
Ci/izfnMonroe thinks the circumstances con
)n nested with his appointment, importantâhe
" fiys but little on thefuhjÂ»a at present"âbut
from them a text is to be taken, and comments
f- to follow, which will develope " the wholepoli
:d cy of administration in bis mifjion and recal."â
es Important as the Citizen considers it, the fub
fiance of that polity it is now perhaps not diffi
cult to state.âReiterated were the clamours of.
it she " patriots" for a man of their cafl to be
sent on anembafly to Frapce âthey urged that
" however much they were opposed to the gene
rality of the njeafures of government, yet that
r e they were lovers of their country equally with
>j- those who gave atone to the measures of ad
miniftrationâaer.cauJd it be fuppofe4iut tbat
d " one from among them," would be as ten 1-
, cious in support of the interefls of America,
abroad, as would any charaifler whatever. Be
't fides, said they, eur Gtuation relative to France
1- is such; that fending a man of the political prJn
lt eiples we mention, wdl shew a desire for con
ciliation and harmony, which, otherwise, it may
be thought is not manifefted. 'â¢ In an evi: hour/'
j the President paid too much attention to such
suggestions and washed to believe that good
might result from the appointment : 'from the
g class of " exclave patriots" Citizen Monroe
t, was felefled, and the Senate fandlioned the nom
e ination. It is known that the President and
Sen:te have de -ply regretted that the appoinr
.. ment mas made; but made it, was : "who is
there that liveth and finnetb not?" The man
date, however, which said, return, it may be
'â  hoped was not ifiued too late.
The conduit of the Jacobins should operate as
L a warning to the present and succeeding admin
istrations. In almost all instances have they
shewn that where confidence has been placed in
j them, that confidence has been abused. Tht y
are inveterateâand, in too many instances, in
corrigibleâthey will not leave fcar'cely any
', th ng uneflayed to effeft their views. They
r have spouted much about (heir patriotismâbut
what have been the fruits of this felf-affurrted,
â prostituted appellation .' what, but machinations
_ a pair, ft our government, not only in a foreign
j. country, but also in the.bofoin of Americaâ
what, but the organization of feditious,clubs â
> plots and conspiraciesâand open infurreition a
- gainst the laws ?
However seir we may have been to the brink
j of a war " with our ancient and deferring ally,"
Citizen Monroe must be fully f.-ntible that the
r people have to thank, in no iuconfiderable de
gree, his fellow _ labourers, his patriotic com
peers, for the disagreeable dilemma in which the'
country has been placid : had their plans taken
effedlâhad their policy been adopted, we fbould
probably, long ere this, have (seen involved in
foreign and domeflic war. But thanks'to bet
ter fortune, and to the guardian genius of Ame
rica, our government has hitherto withstood the
aflaults of its ogen and ferret enemies, and well
grounded hopes may be indulged that our po
litical barque will yet ride out the storm, and be
fafely moored in the harbour of peaCe and nrof
perity.
AUGUSTA, August 3.
When the votes of the senate were taken
for Wuliam Blount's expullion from a feat
in that house, the only negative was hon.
Mr. Tazewell, vice-prendeut at the fealt
given to cititizen Monroe.
The conduft of William Blount will not
perhaps appear so very iugular to- our rea
ders, if they will draw their attention to '
some things in which they may feel them- 1
selves more immediately interested. It has 1
been hinted (and we have really no authority i
to discountenance the idea) that Jackson's 1
sole intention in his remonstrance of Febru- '
ary to congress, was to endeavor to effedt 1
an alienation of this state from the federal 1
compact. The language of the remon- i
ftrance itfelf (without having recourse to '
collateral evidences) would have fufficiently >
warranted an idea, of the kind. Whatever c
predilection that father of discord and anar- 1
chy may have discovered towards " our a
lifter republic," we cannot think he would
have had firmnefs enough to offer Georgia as a
a bwty to the general plunder :âNo ! -
Jackson may cajole and intrigue with the b
unwary and uninformedâhe may bribe a a
fct of k-afcals to swear things that never have f

If Mr. M'Millan thinks the following piece tl
worthy a plane in Ijis paper, he will oblige cl
the writer by its infer tion. d-
IT hat been made a qutftion, whether,
f. an r nation; a republican form at govefn
â¢ ment can be long preferred: Many learned
r . andÂ«ngenious men have adopted the nega
tive of this qiieftion, and in support of theifr
m opinion, realbn from past experience and the
f- tendency ef human nature. ' This is a sub
s je&on which, perhaps, certainty will never
h b n ,Â°h a "' ed - . There are some principles
â n without which no people can be
\ n free, and which, if they universally and pure
-1) prevailed, would support, forever, a re
le publican government. The degeneracy and
is corruption, however, of human 'nature is
4 such, that it is vain' tr> hope they will ever
exist in their proper purity.
e The foundation of a republic is virtue,
i _ This virtue has been accurately defined, to
f s be the preference of public to individual in
it ter<?ft; and conue&ed with it the love of the â¢
li democracy itfelf, as the form of government
belt calculated to promote this end. Public
Â® TlrtL(e cannot exist without the aids of mo-
rality and religion. Justice, temperance,
ie frugality, and all the other virtues are ulti
(t mately connefted with it. Self-love is a
â¢- strong and overbearing principle. It must
- - be re (trained and regulated by the influence
ft of religion, or it would defeat the end for
which it was intended. It would destroy
e the happiness of the individual, and interfere
e with the reasonable felf-love of others. Jus
â tice, temperance- and frugality would be
trampled underfoot.
A question more limited than the former
Â« has of late been agitated, and on which we
s hope to arrive at some degree of cerÂ«
ta 'nty. It is whether the French nation
_ can support a republican government ? PreÂ«
vioufly to entering direftly on the fobjed, it
i- may be proper to make one or two more
'f â  observations on the foundation of a repub
Â® llc - Mr " Hume very justly observes that
any degree of true-6r regular liberty requires
t such improvement in knowledge and morals,
I, as can Only be the result of refteftion and
i- experience, and mull grow to perfection du
â¢t ritig- fe venal ages ol Jet tied and crUUi&ed
- government. *
> Examining the French people by the
c principles laid down, we (hall find 1 them ini
. capable not only of supporting a republic,
but almost wholly unfit for any degree of
y liberty. The enthusiasm of that nation,
during the present revolution, has bec% at
' tributed to a disinterested love of a free go
e vernment. This is a falfexonftruaion. Had
e Louis been dethroned to make way for a fa
vored usurper to the crown, the French na
i tion would Jtave adted the fame part
- Those turbulent pafGons by which they are
s charafterifed, when once let loose, may be
turned into any channel. They i?iay very
properly.be compared to a vail quantity of
, confined water, which, at whatever part of'
. the enclosure it breaks through, rufhefout
with equal impetuosity. But we are not
i obliged to reason, only from the nature of
>' the .cafe. There are many fafts which would
* prove the French peoph to be utterly defti
>. tute Â°f disinterested patriotism. Let us at
t tend but for a moment to the definition of
, Public virtue, and compare with it the de
s fertion of 15,000 of the army of the Rhine
1 day. In their armies, it is farid, put.
iifAjrtuc exists in its purityâtheir soldiers
â¢ by the purest principles of re
puphcanifm. How does this assertion cor
rt(|bnd to the faft just stated ?âNo < they
fofight at firft from the enthufiaftia ardor of
a heated brain. They have tontinued to dÂ®
it tiom habit, from a love of conqlieft, and
a desire which victory naturally inspires.
Cut in adversity, which is the time to trr
men's souse, theyifail. If s Uch be the did
pohtion of the armies, what is the Internal
itate of the French people ? Every vice that
can disgrace liufnan nature, every brutal
paflion has there unbounded sway. The
people seem more like demons let loose from
hell, to devour themfelvej and men, than as
the votaries of virtuous liberty. This iÂ« not
a ltrained reprefentarion. Imagination can.
not conceive th,* degree of degeneracy which
prevails-and is not this state of manners
perfectly natural ? Could' any thitig else be
expected from the passions of a Frenchman
let loose, after so many years of slavery,
eiptcially when such degeneracy and cor
ruption prevailed before ? A people whose
manners are hke theirs can rever support a
free government ; they are utterly destitute
of every neceflary qualification. They have .
no virtue, no knowledge, and what is worse,
they feetn studiously to avoid both'. - Were
it made a ijoeftion, whether the present Go
vernment of the United State? can W
lit, there might be, even with -respect to
them, a doubt of their qualifications. But
Franee never can be free. Perhaps, after
infinite miferiesand calamities, they 1 will be
obliged to seek that happiness from a matter
which, left to themselves, thev .vainly en
deavored to obtain. A French foil is too
luxuriant for the tree of liberty. It require,
a moderate foil and conitant cultivation.
it France ever becomes free, it will be
after the country has been filled with blood
a ter the paflions have become moderate
by constant adtionâand after Knowledge
and virtue have resulted from a mod dread
ful experienceâor it will be when some
mighty legislature regulates the passions tod
changes their nature. The former is im.
latter can be effected, only in
a ongcourfeof ages by the influence ofa'o
iolute power.

e P. S. I have just been informed by a
c gentleman of unquestionable veracity, that
, theCommitteehas said, the Board of Health
_ intend to invite the citizens to return from
s the country, and that Dr. Shippen who left
the City to day asserted just before he went
j off, that there i; no contagious disease in
. the City, but was a mere South Sea
r bubble.
1 It is also reported that a similar opinion
i has been delivered to the Board of Health,
, by Meffra. Girard and Lownes. I would
p fain hope for the fake of my fellow citizens,
' as well at for the fake of the understandings
, of those gentlemen, they have not commit
ted such an error, for none but men insane
can possibly refill the torrent of 1 evidence to
the contrary.

CAUTION.
WHERKAS a combination of men in this
county hare undertaken to enrich thsm
felves,by fabricating titles to fundr/ valuable trails
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New
York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which
trails of lsnd large sums of money have been paid
to those fraudulent pen, by innocent purchasers â¢
It is therefore just that public information should
be given, to the end, that the injured may feck rc
drefs wliile the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have difcovered are Tru
man Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several others who go under fi&itious names. It is
supposed that the lauds offered fcr sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at lea!l worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have afiual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and la, OtfegÃ patent,
thousand acres each, the aflual property of William
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chauir.ot)t, row of Paris, and James Ayenll
and othecs, ot this State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard Wclis and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing those lands, as also to de
prive those men in future from impoGng on indivi
duafs, which their education and address have en

1 Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
Trunnn Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to thera, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, which
was the property of William T, Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and otilers; and further the said Joseph
and Truman did jierfuade irn* to do this against my
inclination, which was made out on the it tli day
of November, or set back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the nami of
Pardon Starks to that deed waa a fictitious name,
thtre being no such perlon there. To this I make
voluntary oath. THOMAS KELLY.

sand acres of land in the Otego patent, and pro
mised this deponent a share of the profits, on the
'sale of said lands, for his so doing ; and that they
made application several times for the fame purpo'e,
which fervicss this deponent as often refufed, de
claring to them that he had no right to lands, and
could do no such thing ; which daring attempt on
thisdÂ«pÂ«nent's integrity he had related among his
friends several times, previous to making this affi
