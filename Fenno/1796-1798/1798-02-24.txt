When a man become* the avowed author
of 1 publication he fubjefts himfelf, as well
is his performance, to criticism and remark.
The book now in circulation under this ti
tle if properly p*bli(hed would have made
a pamphlet of frxty-tix pages; initead of
which t appear* under the affe&td impor
tance of a targe oÂ£tavo volume, price 150
cents, copy right secured according to law.
The new part of this publication in a po
litical point of vitw i altogether innocent
and as a literary performance it is below cri
ticrfm. Like "Randolph's vindication, it
Will die 3 natural death, leaving all who had
any agency in bringing the drformed bant
ling into life, in painful condolence over tjie
mortified vanity of the author; but the pa
pers styled " inflruHions, and
and other authentic documents" which, forir
the appendix are entitled to a different fort
of attention. VanityÂ»and egotism may be
derided ; hut infidelity in the execution of a
public trust (hould be exposed and puniflied.
Of the many absurdities, with which the
" view " abounds one will be fufficicnt to
(hew the anthor's regard toprincipie andeon
fiftency. Among the objections to Mr.
Jay's appointment to tlie court of London,
he that in hiÂ« opinion it wa3 un
eonditutional to confer upon a judge an
Executive office, and under this impreflion
he as Senator fortbe State of Virgin!* vot
ed against the nomination. A short time af
terbeing dill a member ofthat branch of the
Legi'flature, the Secretary of State inform
ed him that the President was defirotis to a
vail the public of his services in a similar ap
pointment. The conditutiortal fcriiples of
the Senator were thus lulled to reft, he " re
ctircd the communicatioa with a due degrteof
fenjibility," for the honor irfttnded ; and in a
f<w days with that gi*afceful blnfhing modes
ty for which the democrats are so remarka
ble, returned an aflurance of his perfefr wil
lingness to accent the invitation. To com
rt.on observers, not (killed in the subtlety of
diftindions, it would seem as uucondituti
onal to nominate a member of the Legisla
ture, as a member of the Judiciary to an ex
ecutive office { and if a violation of the
conditution at all, is not less an offence in
bin who accepts, than in him who confers
the appointment. It is difficult to make it
an iifftiicc in one, without admitting the o
-ther to be an accomplice. This paraxon of
principle and eotijifleniy embarked shortly as
rer, and arrived at Pari* in due time, where
In's public condaft is marked on the one
ban 1 with difrtfpefl and inattention to th*"
indru&ions .fcf the Executive, and on the
other with of meanness andfervili
ty towards the French government, which
will remain unparalclled in thehidory
of diplomatic interco'jrfe. He was regard
ed and in many respeCts treated by the
Conynlttee of public fafety as one of their
own poffce officers, and the reptile infenfi
ble of the ignominy seemed to glory tn it,
and on all occasion* fought ofporonitics of
exhibiting to the w< rld the evidences of his
own Sifgrace and ptottration.
There occurs in this publication no 111
fiance of a common refpett to the mftruc
tions of his own government, and it would
be equally difficult to find a (ingle deviation
from the orders, or what with him amount
ed to the fame thing, the w.'fhes of hisgal
lican mailers. When required by the Presi
dent to infill upon that security and refpetl
to which our treaty and the rights of neu
trality entitled us, he avoided to do so for
months, upon frivolous pretences; and at
length left it upon a footing the mod humil
iating to an independent nation. It will be
a fortunate circumflance if our envoys now
Â»t Paris, with their acknowledged talents
ind virtues (hall be able to relieve us from
the humiliation and cmbarraffment to which
the crooked politics cf this man and his par
ty have reduced the United States. We
talk of Randolph's basenessâos Blount'*
treason of Lyon's brutality; but what
a*e these when contracted with the crimes
of their co-ordinate and co-infamous feHow
patriot, minister Monroe.
Have the people of America seen the e
vidences of these crime*? No. An acau
rate knowledge of their extent and turpitude
rauft unfortunately be confined, in the na
tore of things to a narrow circle, for a time
at lead; some of them will be seen in the
perusal of his book, but there is another
fenfif whose monitions are faithful, and with
respect to the people at large, not less to be
depended upon : we have feltj and will long
continue to feel the consequences of this
nWn's perfidious condescension and apoftacy.
Let dismission from effice, impeachment,
,and expulsion be still regarded as the proper
punishments fcr the pigmies of sedition,
who have merited them ; # but, let allthe ex
ecration of an incensed and injured nation,
be referred for the arch traitor who, upon
afalary of 9000 Ds. a year,could plot mifchiefs
hi* country, three thonfand miles
Â©
from home.
What then are the crimes of which he is
aecufed ? It would require a volume larger
than hi* own to record them. They are of
a nature neither to be palliated nor jollified,
they evidence a want of attachment to the
country which gave him birth; they mani
fcfl a preference to the in t ere (I of a foreign
nation ; and by uniting personal ingratitude
with political perfidy, operate alike to el
tablifh the depravity of his head and heart.
It is nAt neceflary to rcfort to the archievel
of (late, for reason* to juflify hi* dismission
from public ferviee, and from the confidence
of the Prcfident; hit own coufeflions furnidl
ample evidence of guilt, and from the p:g
---m of hi* own book (hall he be condemned.
Knaves may fecrctly attempt to vindicate,
and fooli may publicly (even on the floor of
Congrcfs) eulogizebut the unerring judg
ment of "a Aream like public," will ulti
mately (lamp upon Monroe, and his co-ad
jutors the indelible infamy of having brought
this (not their) country to its present date
of jeopardy and agitat'ion. Pusy offenders
against society, with the hope of evading
puni(hment, seldom make public coofeffioos
of their crimes; it is not so with Mr. Mon
roe. His mind familiarized with political
vice, and nerved to desperation, braves the
censure of good men, and boldly appeals to
the ignorance, and passions of hi* party far
protection. Will he find that protection ?
Yrs! to their (hamebe it said he will.. The
mantle of faflion the Lyon
of Vermont, is broad enough to save the
of Virginia ; but this shield, impreg
nable as it may be iii rtfpeft to legal punilh
ment, cannot feeure him from the indigna
tion of the enlightened, and Anuricart part
of the community. They will read Jiis
book; they will judge for themfrlvts, and
must condemn. In thatbook are to be trac
ed the wiles of cool and deliberate ireafon.
There (lalks an American minister in the
undisguised habit of a French Jacobin ;
there are tht outlines of plans by which he
attempted, and still attempts to poison the
folirtes of public confidence, to undermine
the political foundations of our country ;
" to prostrate its'charSflef and bed interests
before the idol of French power," and like
a minion, faithful to the cause of his new
masters, there are to be seen fpecimcns of
the insidious machinations By which he hop
ed to coerce the government under whose
authority be aÂ£ted, to embark the fortunes
of the United States upon the bottom of
anarchy and irreligion.
The firft charge that need be diftinSly
noted for the purpose of establishing the
justice of the preceding remarks, will be
found in a paper styled " observations sub
mitted to the consideration of the diploma
tic members of the committee of public
fafety." Appendix, page 82. This " loy
al report" is admitted by some of the po
litical friend* of Mr, Monroe, to be an of
ficious mifreprrfentation at lead, unauthor
ised by inftruiStions, or circumstances and
highly rtprehenfible. It may be shewn to
be unjujlijinblc. He knew that loan* in Eu
rope could not at time be obtained by
the American government for their own
plirpofcs, without submitting to extraordi
nary facrifices. He knew that beside the
debts in Holland, the United State* then
owed upwards of two million* , of dollars to
the Frenah nation, and that every peffible
etertion was making to discharge it. He
knew that our difputet with the Barbary
powers wefe unsettled, and that great ex
pence would necessarily attend their adjust
ment. -He knew that it wa* the feafe. of
the people, and the ardent desire of govern
ment to adopt some fyftematic.9nd efficar
c'ious plan to extinguish tht public debt of
all descriptions. He knew that there was
a party in congrcfs (for he had been a con
spicuous member of that party hinrfelf)
who calumniated the gevcrnmcnt for not'
having proceeded more fuceefsfully in the
accomplilhnient of that great work. 'He
knew that onr pecuniary refolirces in a fet
tled order of things, were barely equal to
the public' demands ; that the operation*
Â»f the treasury had been for year* greatly
impeded by the expences attending an In
dian war-unufuaily expensive ; that the -wheels
of government at that moment were almojlflop
ped by means of the wedern infurreftion ;
heknew, for he ha* published it to the world,
appendix page 251, that hit. own induc
tions contained these remarkable and im
pressive words, " we are unable to give her'
aids of men ar money." And yet knowing
this to be our situation, he was so loft to
allfenfeof duty, as to invite the committee
of public fafety to press us on the score of
money. He even laid the plan, and hum
bly-requeded permission to aid citizen Adet
with private advice on the fubjefl. Had
no other objection exided againd the mea
sure, it mud have occurred to a mind not
wholly blinded by partiality, of fomet'hing
â ,wrirfe, that a loan of five millions of dollars
from an individual date, or from the Unit
ed States under the then circumdance* of
Europe, would have amounted to a mani
fed departure fronl the principles of neu
trality. The perception of Mr. Monroe,
and his friends would probably have been
awakened with refpeft to its impropriety,
had Mr. f Jay'Â» treaty (lipulated a loan of
one tenth part of the amount, to the king
of England for a similar purpose ; that is
to fay, for the purpose of carrying on the
war in which the authoritic* ox this coun
try had engaged to be neutral. But, read
er, reserve your indignation for the sequel !
It is no that jacobins are not
to be truded in money matters. In the
fame document, Mr. Monroe explicitly ad
mits (what it (hould be the pride of every
American to deny) that' the United States
are capable of submitting to dismember
ment. These are his traitorous coneefiions.
'â Would it not (fpeakingof a peace with
Spain and England) leave those powers free
to attack us united, and in that situation
would not Franc* be forced again to em
bark in the war, or tamely look en andfet our
difmcmherment." And this too by powers
who (according to Mr. Monroe) were at
that time bowed down by the decrepitude
of corrupt monarchical edabliihments, and
with fear and trembling imploring peace,
and forgivenef* from France. I* this then
the tenure'by which we hold our union and
independence ? Is there another man within
the United States so bale as not to disown
the degrading sentiment ? When the proper
time arrives, our enemies abroad and all
their abettor* at home will be once, more
taught that the'energies of America are
not extind, as has been falfely inlinuated ;
the eagle i* not dead, but in a (late of re
pofc, and when provoked to aCtion will not
prove the less formidable for having had a
few year's reft. Did Great-Britain .futju
gatc and dilmcmbcr these infant dates wbjn
they counted little mÂ»>re than two mlllitJM j
of fouls without Tiipnity'~and a go- I
verntnent ? And now that we have more ,
than treble that number, is it possible that j
a man wbofe foul is not contaminated ,by 1
French influence, fhmild ferioufiy suppose i
that we hare any thing ta apprehend from |
Spanish aggrefiieri ? The true defence of a j
nation, cÂ»nfi!ls in the vir.tue and union of j
their citizens ; and independence is to be '
preserved, not by douching before a so- ,
power however formidable, .and pur
chasing hpr favor by difgraceful condefcen- j
fion ; but by doing juflkc, aiiif requiring
from others the like deportment: This is
the language of America, and the man ca
pable of speaking, and feeling .differently,
was wifely determined by the President un
fit to be his representative abroryl Was
Prussia difmemberedj when her brave old
king (dei iving pecuniaiy aid only from a
i single ally) withdood for seven years the u
nited efforts of the great powers of Europe ?
No ; he ultimately vanqtiiflied them all ;
and in this glorious manner will th/r United
States fuccefsuilly refill the attacks- of our
enrmies from whatever quarter they may
come.. In â¦hi* manner too, wife men know
and honed men hope, thjt England, in the
present crisis of her affairs, will repel the
projefted invasion. It has long been the
unfortunate policy of that nation to bur
then ht'rfelf with allies ; but Ihe is now
clear of them, and htr gallant and enlight
ened font will not fail to ad worthy of
themfelvea.
The next charge that Mr. Monroe's con-,
feflions fnrnifh against himft,lf is, that in a
fries of 'etters written from Paris (in the
character of minister plenipotentiary to the
executive anthfirity Â®f the United States)
regardless of the principles of neutrality
established by the President, and approved
by the legislature, he advised a resort to
hostile measures againfl Great-Britain, after
being officially apprised that our differences
with that court were amicably adjusted by
treaty, snd even after he had been inform
ed that the treaty was ratified.
Out of the cloud of evidence furm'fhed
by himfelf in support of this#harge it will
;be fufficient tOr notice two only requesting
the reader to pause.a moment ; to recolleft
that the treaty when ratified became a law
of the land ; to observe the refpeftive dates
of these communications ; to consider their
contents; to refleft upon the confeqiiences
which must in all probability have attended
the adoption of his nefarious
then to determine the difference between his
offence and that for which the ex-senator
Blount (lands impeached. War was not
produced in. either cafe j but it was the ob-
Jest aimed at in both. Yet the leaders of
the fa'ftion have the unblushing effrontryto
assert that they have been the friends of
peace. Hear then the " precious confefi
onj, of Mr, Monroe whom they have rot
yetr call off; they,muft own him with all the
eonfufion and fhanje with which bis works
have covered them.
Prom Mr. Monroi to the Secretary of State.
Paris, June 26th, 1795.
Appendix, page 180. " Peace is a blef
fihg which ought nqt to be wantonly thrown
away 5 but whether fufficient facrifices hive
net been already made, to preserve it, and
the time arrived when the duty 'we owe to
ourselves, and the refpeft ,which is due to
the opinion of the world adtrtonifh us that
the insults and injuries are to be no longer
barne, aad that .we ought to seek redress by
again appealing to arms, and putting the is
sue of our cause upon the event of war;
is a point which will no doubt be wifely de
cided by those who have a right to decide it."
This extraft is no otherwise important,
than a* it shews in unequivocal terms the
bias;and operations of the writers mind at
the time he supposed the treaty to be under
cpnfideration in this conntny, and the politi
cal view* of the party in the Senate who
for three weeks opposed the ratification
which they well knew would give a mortal
wound to American jacobimfm, and all the
sanguinary and deftruftive measures which
were prepared to follow its soot-steps. It
may too be fairly presumed that if such were
thecontents of the ex-minister's official com
munications ; he was not Wanting in those
of a private and less formal nature, of which
it is known that about the commencement
of that eventful feflion of thÂ»Â»Senate great
numbers arrived.- The next extraft esta
blishes his guilt, and in conjunftion with
the preceding, proves inconteftibly, that his
opinions were derived from the mofl profli
gate and polluted foureeâthe French cabinet.
Frtm Mr. Monroe to the Secretary of State.
, Paris, September 10th, 1795.
Appendix, page 210. After recommend
ing with great solicitude that the adjust
ment of eur differences with England, (at
a time when the terms of adjnftment had
been fettled by treaty) should be left to
France, he proceeds,
" But to secure success by embarking this
government with full zeal in our behalf, and
finking terror into England, it will be ne
cessary to lay hold *f her property within the
United S/alet, take the polls, aad even in
vade Canada. This would not only secure
to us our claims upon Britain, and efpecial
.ly if we likewise cut up her trade by priva
.tters ; but by making a decisive and power
ful diversion in favor of France promote and
very essentially a general peace." A diver
sion in favor of France ! That was the fa
vorite objeft of Mr. Monroe, and if attain
ed, facrifices of American iutered and A
merican honor were in his estimation matters
of "inferior concern. The treaty thus pro
posed to be annulled for the purpose of ma
king a diversion infavor of Fraime wasfigned
â at London on the 19th of November, 1794
âthe Senate met on the Bth of J*ne, '95,
and advised its ratification, and such are the
vagaries of our nvaifter's heated brain on
the 10th of September following. Whither
has all this heroism and military ardor
flown ? Since returning to America by some
llrange regeneration not publ cly understood,
he appeais to be a disciple of the meek and
lowly General Coilot, and like him preach
es only the tloflrine of peace and humiliati- I
on. In the true style of French fraternity 1
| and devotion they talk of the impiety of
I resistance under the chafleuing rod of the <
I terrible republic, and of the bleflings which
j attend fnbmiflion. The wrath of our five
j foverelgns is jufl, and can only be appeased
! by the patience and forbearance which these
I authorized teachers inculcate.
, Such are th( mifltonaries which Paris the
' great temple of infurreftion and tumult has
I sent to this country ; their views are to dif
traft-our public councilsâto preach peace,
peace to an unfufpefting people whom they
have long deluded, when there is 110 peace
âto calumniate and detrail from the well
esrned fame of the ill u(t riot; s Wafhington â
to aecufe the firm and faithful Adams of
favoring royalty, and of making war speech
es for the purpose of wounding that liberty
which the services of his lite have so eminent
ly contributed to ellablifh ; and as if their
enmity against the people of the United
States whom they profefs " to adore" W33
not confined to this world ; they have vain
ly conceived the project of undermining the
religious opinions of our country. Citi
zens of America ! Beware of the political
as well aÂ» religious hcrcfies of these mission
aries ; they are foreigners ; they are wolves
in sheep's cloathing ; they belong not to us !
CONGR E 5 S.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY FEBRUARY 2J.
The bill providing for the widows and
orphans of certain deceased officers, was
read the. third time and passed.
A communication was laid before the
house by the Speaker from the Secretary of i
the Treasury, inclosing sundry documents
prepared by th* late commissioner of the re
venue, in confequenceof a resolution of the
house of the 6th of January, 1797, re
quiring to be laid before the house every
session, within ten days after its meeting, a
statement of the net produce of the internal 1
Revenues, the fajaries of the collectors, &c. j
for the year proceeding- The Secretary '
apologizes for not having made the commu- j
sication fooner.âlt was ordered to be
printed.
Mr. S. Smith presented a petition from
the ptinters of the daily papers in Baltimore,
eompla'ning of the irregular mannerin which
they receive the. Philadelphia newspapers,
owing, as they suppose, to the large quan
tity sent by the pott, and praying that they
may be allowed to receive them free of poll
age in the ordinary way in which letters are
received.
Mr. S. Smith movet ifiat this petition be
referred to the committee on the fubjeiS of
Poll-Offices and Po'ft*Roads; but on Mr.
Thatcher's (the chairinan of that commit
tee) faying, that he believed the Post-mas
ter Genetal had already taken means to re
medy the grfevance complained of, the peti
tion was referred to him.
A message was received from the Senate,
informing the house, that they had passed
the bill for the relief of Willianv Alexander,
and the bill for appropriating a sum of mo
ney for holding a treaty with the Indians.
The committee of enrolment, reported
these bills duly enrolled, and they received
the signature of the Speaker.
Mr. R. Williams presented the petition
of F. W. Eldridge, praying for compensa
tion for services of his father, who died in
the service of the United States.âReferred
to .the committee of claims.
Mr. D. Foster from the committee of
claims, made an unfavourable report-on the
petition of John M. Taylor, who prayed
for the payment of certain warrants. On a
motion to have this report read a feeond
time for the purpose of being agreed to by
the house, Mr. Giles expressed a wish that
it might for the present lie upou the table.
Agreed.
On motion of Mr. Harrifon, the unlnifh
ed b'lfinef* of the bill for altering the man
ner of entering {tills, was postponed till
Monday.
A message was received from the Presi
dent of the United States, iu the following
words:
" Gentlemen of the Senate, and
Gentlemen of the House of Reprefentativet,
" The inclosed Memorial from the com
mifiioners (appointed under an aft of the U
nited States entitled, " an aft for establish
ing the temporary and permanent feat of go
vernment of the United States) representing
the situation and circumstances of the city
of Washington, I take this opportunity
to present to both houses of the Legislature
and recommend to their Consideration. Al
exander White, Esq. one of those Commis
sioners, is now in this c'ity, and will be able
to give to Congress, or any of their Com
mittees, any explanations or further inform
ation, which the fubjeft may require."
"JOHN ADAMS."
United States, Feb. 23, 1798.
The message and the memorial accompa
nying it (which prays further aflittance from
Congress in behalf of the Federal City") were'
ordered to be printed, and were referred to'
a committee of the following' gentlemen,
viz : Mtffrs. Craik, Sitgr'eaves, Brent, Stan
ford, Varnum, Allen, and Sumpter.
Mr. Gallatin moved that the unfinifhed
business of the bill providing means of
Foreign Inteicourfc, be pollponed, for the
purpose of taking up the report of the com
mittee of Privileges.âAgreed.
The Speaker having read the report,
! which was a Tecommendation to disagree to
the resolution for expelling Mr. Grifwuld
, and Mr. Lyon.
: Mr. Davis said he hoped the house would
1 disagree to the report of their committee of
r privileges ; after this was doue, the refolu
r tion could be altered iu such a manner as
: gentlemen might think proper.
, Mr. Dent taHcd for the yeas and Nays,
i âAgreed tÂ« be taken.
Mr. Sitgreavea said there were many aoaÂ«
fiderations which (Vould incline the houie tÂ«
come to a deciSoa upon tbe present bulineft
without entering into any unnecessary dif
ctiflion ; and there were other* whieh (hould
lead them to aroid coming to an immediate
decision. He (hould, therefore move that
the further consideration of this fubjeft be
postponed until the 4th of March, 1799*

The motion for postponement being loft
the question on agreeing tothe report of the
Committee recurred.
Mr. Bayard believed it would not be in
order to call for a division of the question.
The refolucion implicated two ptrfon, which
I he thought improper. If the report of thi
committer was, however, difagretd to, he
j supposed it would then be in order to move
for a division of the question. He (hould,
therefore, vote against the report as he wifli*
ed the cases to be separately considered, aÂ»
they, stood on dt'ilinft ground, and were.not
I attended with the fame circumstances ; and
| reasoning from analogy, he knew of no in
stance in a Court of Jullice, where twoper
â¢ foris had ever been included in the fame
charge when iheir crimes were different. If
the iituation of both these gentlemen had
bfen'the the fame there might have been
propriety in coupling them together ; but
: as this was not the cafe, he was opposed to
j taking an opinion upon both together.
Mr. M'Dowell thought it would be proÂ»
per to take the fame course in this business
as was taken in a former cafe. He moved,
therefore, th.it the report be read a second
time, for the purpose of committing it to
a committee of the whole house.
Mr. Gordon was opposed to this mode
of proceeding. Every one knew the question
and were as well prepared to decide upon
it now, as they would be after going into a '
committee upon it.
Mr. Giles thought it would comport
more with of the house, to decide
this business without going into a committee
of the whtole, a# he believed every one had
made up his mind upon it. If gentlemen in
tended by the course heretofore taken to
raise the dignityofthe house, he thought they
had deceived themselves ; forhe believed tbe
houfp was never in a left dignified attitude
than during that discussion.
MrJ McDowell thought the mode he had
pointed out neeeffary, for the fake of uni
formity ; but, as other gentlemen feenjed to
think it unnecessary, he would withdraw hiÂ»
motion.
Mr. R. Williams wiflitd to know whe
ther it would be in order to amend the ..re
port Â©f the committee-os privileges ;or to
suggest the propriety of difagreiing to' it,
for the purpose of fubftitutiitg a different
punifhmend from that proposed, viz. that
the offending members ihould be repfiman
ded by the Speaker in the presence of tbe
house ? He believed that a punilhment of
this kind would fatisfy many gentleman who
did not wilh to expel the members, but whÂ»
at the fame time, did not wish they should
go unpuni/hed.
The Speaker said that motion would be
in order after the report of the committee
was decided upon.
Mr. Gallatin remarked, that if the report
was agreed to, the resolution for an expulsion
would of course be negatived, and then any t>-
ther proposition would be in order ; and, on the
other hand, if the report was disagreed to, the
resolution would be before them, and open to
amendment. Mr. G. said he rose to make an
observation upon what feH from the gentleman
from Delaware (Mr. Bayard). That gentler-m
had said he would vote against the report,
raufe he wished to distinguish between the two
members. The reason which he gave, though
he might have good reason? for his vote, did
not appear to him to be correfk. That gentle
man seemed. to suppose that the fa<ss for whicli
the two members were to be expelled, were of
fences of the fame nature, and committed on
the Tame day. What related to the previous
condufl of the member from Vermont, was
hot now under consideration. J* order to have
that cendu& before them, it would be neeffa
ry that a reconCderation of it fhottld be moved
by a member who voted against that member's
expnlfion, and leeonded by another member who
voted on tie fame fide of the question. The
argument of the gentleman from Delaware,
theiefore, did not apply He said, he Ihould
himfelf vote in favour of the report of the com
mittee of privileges ; as he waÂ» against expel
ling either of the gentlemen".
Mr. agreed with the gentlf-rsan last up
in liis conclusions ; but be d d nor si cin rightly
to have uudtiftood the argument of the gentle
ins n from Delaware. If the gentleman from
Pennfylvanla was acqu tinted with legal princi
ples, with'eflablifhed principles relative to pun
ithn e t, he mull know that no perfsnt can be
charged jointly with an iffeiice, except jointly
guilty, and event they had mutually agreed
t;> commit the offence. The resolution in its
ore Tent form, th refore, offended agiinft eftab
;i(htd maxims of p-opriety.
Vr. Kayard said, the statement of (he gentle
nriu frcm Perinfylvania was not corre't. He
had stated that the offences of the two members
were the fame in c>cumftar.c<e. ande mm ttrd
at the fame time. He apprehtnded the two cas
es were very diMinl) ; as by the deptdit.ons be-fore the heuft, it appeared th.it the menjher tm
from Conneflieut was committed before the H,
house was calh d to order, and that the offence f,
of the nember from Vermont was committed â¢ J
after the houf* was called to order. 'I he argu- f
ment most depended upon in a former cafe, a- 4
gainst the expulsion of the member from Vcr- y
wiont, was that wh ch inGfled that the ail of
yiolence complained of, l>*ing committed when t
the house -was not in fcflion, was not a cause of
expulfion'. lfth'S arpiment had weight it that
time, it ought also to have weight in the present
cafe. It woulsl 'therefore, be the height of in- J
justice to blend the two cases together - r since mit
there might be cause for expelling one meraber,
and not the other.
The Speaker ohferved that evtry thing which ' "
had been said with ref| eil to a division of theJJut' ut
qucllicn was out of order, as it eould not bedi- 111 1
vided. He would also remark, in order to
ihorten the debate, that tie house zuat nit celled rea '
to order <wben the Jlrnke was madehy the mem- a * )l '
her from Vermont, upon tbe member from Con- caÃ
KeSieut without tb( bar cf the houseâ  C "F
Mr Hirper alked if the report of the commit- Alt
tee (hould not be agreed to, whether the rsfo
lution might not then be agreed to ? p ve
The Speaker replied, it could not be divided ; in 8
but a separate resolution might be brought for- of ' 1
ward. cor

Tbe resolution for an expulsion having , in<
been disagreed to, â¢
Mr- R. Williams proposed a resolution in ,r
the following words:
" Resolved, That Roger Grifwold and "
Matthew Lyon, for riotous and d'forderly i,;
behaviour in this house, are highly cenfura- ,h
ble, and that they be reprimanded by the m
Speaker in the presence of the house." th
Mr. Harper moved the previous question
upon this resolution. He did it, he said, 1
~ upon this groundT The hoiift had just de
cided, and they had lately decided in ano
ther instance, that disorderly conduA (hall
not be punilhed by expulsion ; and it was
his opinion that no less punifhmer.t than ex- T
pulfion ought to be lnfliiaed, as he was on- ,n
willing to diminish the reprehenftve power
of the house, by inflifting what he thought f
inadequate punilhment for the offence. If ââ 
there were any gentlemen who thought thiÂ» ai
conduct excusable, and tliat it ought not to n
bÂ« punilhed, they would, of coutfe, vote J" 3
I in favour of the previous question; and those
who thought with him, that both ought to ?
be expelled, would also vote in favour of it. f (
Mr. Nicholas called for the yeas and nays r ,
upon this queftiVn.âAgreÂ«d to be taken. I<
Mr. Gallatin said, by the gentleman from ' &
S. Carolina's having moved the previou* c
question, he had excluded any discussion ] *
upon rhe merits qf the main question. Mr. t
G. wilted some fcafons might be given why t ,
the main question ought not to be put. r
Those given by the gentleman from S. Car- si
olina were applicable to the resolution itfelf; f
they were reasons why toe should vote against f
the resolution, but they did not strike him
as reasons why the question (hould not it all f
be t3ken. v I
The previous question was then put in this b
form, " Shall th â  main quejlion ( viz. the refol- si
ution for reprimanding the offending mem- F
bers) noiu.beput?" And the yeas and nays ( v

After calling his eyes jmnnd the hall for a few

ef between three or four minutes, Mr. Grifwold

that it was a preconcerted plan, did not

from different parts of the house. That as Mr.

ought to have done them justice, and expelled

TRIUMPH of ORDER. S
A review of all the circumstances attend
ing the eonteft just decided, displays the si- y
nal triumph of thefriendsto order, in a light b
fplend'd i iJeed. The paltry fa&ion of pre- 0
tended republican* had left unemploytd no h
resource of art or violence that might di
rctllv or remotely contribute to forward
thfir designs. In lawless mobs they tyran- [
nically beat up the quarters of the peaceable
federalifts, anda&ually threatened with the
French code of club-lavr, every man who c
hadfirmnefs tÂ» obey the diftates ofhisown j f
confcienee, or pursue the convidlions of his v
reason and judgment. Nor did their tuibu- (
lent and lawless pra&ices end here.âOn the j t
tle&ion ground, in one of the diftridts, a 1 i
horseman, compleatly caparisoned, and arm- \ {
ed, with a drawn sword in hit hand, paraded j t
the ele&ion ground the whole day, with the i t
manifeft design of awing the weak, with the (
tremendous label 'â  Israel or Death" on his j i
cap, and the raw-head and bloody bones
with a cofnn, underneath. In another dif- 1
trkil;, the dependants on Citizen Snuff,
theLrt>ir, paraded the ground with French
cockades in their hats, and armed with 1
bliidgeons. Corruption, of the fouled kind,
was carried on by fubfeription, and many
taverns were kept open for a week previous
to the eleftion, free of expence to all pre
cious republicans. By means like thefc, and
a thousand other arts, by calumnies and lies
of the fouled and moll gruundlefs nature,
this insolent phalanx of fo'idifant republicans,
appear ia the refnlt with a falfe and unbot
tomed forceâ-with a weight not their own.
The weather, too, unfortunately cut off ma
ny-hundred votes, which would otherwifc
j appear in the federal fide. It is a fad, ton
! remarkable to escape comment, that in the
Northern Liberties where the whole number
of taxable: amount only to 1800, that the
total amount of votes should reach the asto
nishing number of near 1600 ; while in the
city, where -the taxable* amount 'to 8000,
no more than 34.C0 votes can be drawn out.
Thi* ts drange, very drange !
i Under all these circumstances disadvanta
geous on the one hand, and the extraordina
ry and illegal steps resorted to on the other,
it is a circumstance irrefidibly evincive of
the overbearing strength of the friends of
order, that, they finally triumphed. Ani
mated by so glorious and splendid as issue 5
and ftrowg in the confidence which a good
cause so invariably inspiresâlet us perfevFe
with unceasing constancy, in the ways of well
doing. For by an invincible condancy and
perfevera*ee, alone can we expert to coun
tervail that daring obdinacy with which the
partisans of confufion, of treason and assassi
nation unremittingly pursue their desperate
designs, againd the comfort of society, and
against the fortunes and the lives of us all.
The Aurora fays the independent federal
eleftors of the city were bribed. It is afle
-1 ed who bribed the federal yeomen of Dela-.
ware county ? It isthus the adorers of the
people compliment their virtue and integrity
when they presume to exercise their own
I judgment in opposition to these would be
' tyrants, the exclyfive patriots.

though he pretends, when it fwits him, that
his calling as an editor, involves in it the

ut Col Brandt, ef the Six Nations, had sent

}, e to the North, for the purpose of inviting
s a l them to a confederated Council at the Firc

all for this purpose, with a Black Wampum
pj Belt, whose answer was, " If CÂ«1 Brandt,

' a they should have met us at our own Fire

A"T a junfture when the question of

becomes extremely ufefut to those eitizens Â©f the

This work is principally distinguished by the

ihe judioious reader will not appreciate the work
lesion that account; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, arc the re

LETTER 111.
EUayin the forra of a tablcAU, to sppraife the im
poi tations into tne United States from France arid Eng~
Und un fed. The author examines at each article 9
whether it can be better furniftied from France or
Englandâlt is principally on this fubjeft (which
would have aftooifhed a mere thtorift) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kin l of tableaux, uuluckily as difficult to obtain as
they are much to be desired, are the only sure guides
the statesman can take for th policy of treaties de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved.. We cannot too much admire the apparent ex
aftnefs of colonel Swan's calculations; and all hough
the propWrfies of Lord Sheffield have already been
contradided by experience, and by several able pens,
yet it is cui ious to fee the author of the prelent work,
dispute with him the only groui d on which he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
tinder the requited condition, will be better able
than Great Britain to supply us with several articles,
which the Englilh author allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's patriality ajefl on (if he
has any) does nÂ»t appear to have at any time created
z partiality cj judgment. "The result of this calculation
is that Â»n *7Â©9Â» that is to (ay, at a period when arts
and manufactures did eot present in France the vafl
means and piobabiti:y of extension which they now
poffcfa. that even in 1789, it was pcefumablr, that
Fiance wÂ©uld not only have the means to supply one
half of anv given Quantity of the produftions of Franci
and â  rtgland united, but also to enter into competition
with Great Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wisdom of her government, and Itie industry
Oi her inhabitants.
LETTER IV.
Calculation of the of the United States,
and particular examination of their suitableness to
France; this is one reason why, notwithstanding the
excell iÂ»t work of Mr. Tench Coxe, Mr. Swan's ta
bleau is by Â©0 means fupeifluous i the principle of the
advantages which would result to France Irom the
importation of provifiom and raw materials, i* every
where applied ; and it is upon this argument, that
the Â«uthor eftablilhes his demands to the French go
vern|nentÂ» * or l^c limited sdmtflion of the produc
tionsof his country into France.
LETTER V.
Tableau, of the debt of the United States at that
timeâOpinions of the author on the finances, on the
effects of national debt, on circulation, Sec. as more
amply detailed in his Natiooal Arithmetic printed at
fiofton in the year 1786 ; the whole calculated to
strengthen in France, thepublc and private credit
â¢f the United States âthe happy condition of Ameri
ca, and the miseries arising from the public debt in
Europe, arc cootrafted in the ablcft manner, and un
der the mod ttriking lelations, by very cu ious cal
culations âObfetoations on the wisdom and economy
which preside over the public expenfea in Maflachu
fetts. In this place the patriotism of the author ap
pears, with all the elevation which a just national
pride inlpires. The ancient governments of Europe,
lavs he, vyill learn from us the art #f economy in
recompensing he frrvices which the country receives.*
Among fl us it will be seen, that men are chojen for places,
and nÂ»t places for men. ThÂ»s letter corciudes with a
general view of the public property, depohted in the
hands Â©f the government of the United States.
LETTER VI
General examination of the defeA* of the commer
cial policy of France with refpeft to the Umtfd States ;
many of these observations have produced the effc&s

praise a man when he eiercrfcs a dilhnguilhed em
