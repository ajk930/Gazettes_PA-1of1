THE rotsrissof Mr. Jeffcrfon vainly ttuleavor
ed to vindicate his conduct refpefiing his connec
tion with the editor of the National Gazette and
hit opposition to the measures of government, while
secretary of state;
In re'fpeÂ£t to theÂ«fjrft they hid, '' that Mr. Fre
neau was recommended by leveral of his fellow col- ,
legiates, men of high reputation and who were m
terelted in his welfare*: and that, to entitle him
to the office which Mi. Jeffcrfon bellowed on him,
it was mefely necessary that he fhuulcj he Â» citizen :
of the United States, and irreproachable in point
of morality and in other tefpeflp quajihed to
difchargc iia duties."âlt is at rjpee seen thai, fnch
< an apology, to an enligh'eued publh-, is at insult
ing a, was lhÂ« caitdtnil which it was designed to
. gloss over.' âAs Vlt. Jcff.'tfon, (hould
he be elected pre'ridcnt, and penfio:i a printer to ]
i support his metfures, attempt hereafter to varnish <
over such an aby a like vindication. ]
At to the second point,'ihefc votaries, whose c
' devotion for their idol kindled at every form, in t
whith he presented himfelf, Â«ven deduced matter (
of panegyric from hit Â»ppo/ttion to the meafurcs of the 1
government. 'Twas according to them, the sub- t
limeft pitch of virtue in him, not only to have ex
tra-afTlcially embarrassed plans, otiginaling with his f
colleagues, in the course of their progreft, but to
have continued hit opposition to them, after they 1
had been considered and ennttcd by the legiDature, e
with such modifications as had appeared to them r
â¢ proper, and had beenapproÂ»ed by the chief magi- j
Urate. Such cottdu&, iu their, opinion, marked 6
a firm and virtuous, independence of spirit -j-.
If any proof were wanting of that strange per- *
verlion of all ideas of decorum and order, which J
hat long charaflerifed a certain party, this making a
a theme of encomium of what was truly a demon- 0
drat ion of a caballing, felf fujjicicnt, and refradory 1
temper, would afford it. p
I shall endeavour to state what coorfe a.firm and Â£
virtuous independence of character, guided by a
juii and necefTary sense oT decorum, should have
dictated to an Â»fficer in Mr. Jefferfon't station.
Ido not hesitate to reprobate the position, that /
a man, who had accepted an office in the executive
department, should be held to throw the weight of
his character into the feale, to-fuppiJrt a mealure,
which in his confcien'cc he difappreved, and in hit
Jiation had opposedâor that of the ad
miniltration ihould form together a clofeand secret
combination, into whose measures the profane eye
of the public should not pry. But there>is a very
obvious medium between aOing or countenancing, and {
intriguing and machinating against a measure ; be
tween obptjing it in the difchargc of an official duty or
volunteering an cppofiiion to it in the difchargc if no j
duty, between entering into a close and secret combi
nation wi h the other members ot the adminiilra- ''
tion, and bc:',j the aflive leader of an ofpofuitn to
its me furet.
The true line of propriety appears to be the, sol- j
lowing:âA member of the administration in one j
departmeut ought only to aid those meafWs of an-
other, which he approvesâWhere he difapsproves,
if called upon ton J officially, he ought to rnanifeft '
his difipprobation, and avÂ»w his opposition ; but,
out of an official line, he ought not to interfere, r,
" at long at he think jit to coxtinvs a Â»art of
THE ADMINISTRATION." ,
When the measure in quettion has kecome a law Â°
of the land, especially with a dirtil fandhn of the r
chief magi/irate, it it hit peculiar duty to acquiesce.
A contrary conduct is incoyijtcnt with his rdationt P
at an officer of the government, and ivith a due rtfpeÃ '
as fuL h for the decisions of the legjflaturt and of the l
head of the executive department.
The success of every government, itt capacity F
tocoAabine the exertion of public Hrength with the '
preferyation of personal right and private security, j "
must nlways depend on the energy of the executive. I â¢
This energy, again, must materially depend on r
the l/nien aud mutual deference, which subsist between j
the member, of that department, and the confor. J
mity ef their conduit with the view* of the execu- "
â¢live ehief. , F
Difference of opinion between men engaged id â¢
any cafmmoo pursuit, iÂ« a natural appendage of hu- '
man nature. When only exerted in the difehar", B f Â®
a duty, with delicacy and temper, amon* libe.al j f
a*d feiifiblc men, it can create no anidotity : but
when it produces officious interferences, dictated by ' 3
no call of duty ; when it volunteert a display of it- ! '
felt in a quarter where -here is no refponjbilitj, it ! 1
must inevitably beget ill-humour and difcerd. ' 3
Applied to the membeni of the executive adrr.i- *
nitlratiop of any government, and wore particulaily | 1
a republican government, it mull necessarily tend to i f
occasion, more or less, difiraSed councils, to fofler
faaions in the community, and particularly to wta- "
ken the government,
.â loreover, of the several executive de- â 
partments, are ta be viewed as auxiliaries to the Cxe-
cutive chief. Oppofiiion to any measure of iu, by
â  either of those heads, except in the scape of frank; \
firm and independent advice to himfelf, is evidently
contrary to the relations, which fubfilt between the '
parties. And a measure becohles hit, so as to in- '
volver this duty of acquiesce, as well by its having '
received ha.fanÃhn in the form Â»f a { aw> as bÂ£ ]
having previously received his approbation.
One of the powers eiittulted to our chief maÂ»if- )
trate is, that of objetitng to bills which have piHed
tie two house. of congress. This supposes the 5
duty*f objea.ng, when he is of opinion that the !
oljeft ot any bill it either vnccnjlitutional or per- -
mciout. It* approbation of a bill implies, that he '
dou not thin.: it either the one or the other ; and it ,
makes him rejfonfible to the community for this o
p.mon. The measure become, hit by adoption; J
nor could he cfcipe a port ton of the blame, which
SX.. Â» bad measure, to !
which he had given his eonfent. (
Solid as are these printfipl,., the public ear has, !
not with ftawJmg, been frequently assailed with core- j

may be ckxteroufly retailed by the traffickers iii
pular prejudice, these principles, foiftded on poli
tical truth, iidsv. with continence, be iubinitted to
the deliberate upiiiien of an enlightened and iober
j Pe 'l? may be a(k=dâWhat ?is a man to facnfice

I to be a dumb fptftator of measures which he deems
1 fnb'vcrfiVi of the rights ar.d inter eft ot his fellow
'l citizens ? is he to poilpone to the frivolous rules of
a falfe comp'aifance, or the arbitrary'diclates of a
tyrannical decorum, the higher duty which he owes
to t'hÂ« community ? I answer, no ! lie is to do none
' of tliefe thrnga. ' If he caiwot coalesce with thafc,
' with with whom he is alTociated, as far as the ruÂ»es
of official decorum, propriety, and obligation may
require, without abandoning what he conceives to
be the true in'ereft of the community, 1Â« him place
iimfelf in a jituation, in which he will experience no
colli Hon of opposite duties. him not ciing Jo the
hooour or emoluments of an office, and content
himfelf with dtftnd'mg the injured right} of the peo
ple, by ekfeure or indirect meani. Let him renounce
aJstuntion which is a clog upon his patriorifm ; ted
the people that he could no longer continue in it
without forfeiting hÂ« .duty to them, and that he
he had quitted it to btf (poic at liberty to. afford
them his belt terriceÂ».
Such is the course wotrfd have been indicated by a
fircji and virtuous independence of character, that
would have been pursued by a man attentive to u
nite the sense of delicacy with the sense of dutyâin
earned about the pernicious tendency of public
measures, and more felicitous to aft the difinterefied
friend of the people, than the inUreJled, ambitious,
and intriguing bead of a party,.
But Mr. Jefferfon clung for four years to the ho
nours and emoluments of office, Under an admini
!bation, whose measures he greatly disapproved,
and perfevinngly tppofed, till a more perplexed state
of affairs, and the alarming profpeS of approaching
â¢war, dictated his relinqui{hmeÂ»t of a (tation, too
pregnant with anxieties to continue an object of de

2d. Can those, who have a legal right to vote |

ty, any declaration of this fort? 1
I am inclined tÂ« decide in the negative. The 1
mode of voting by ballot is tfce.dirett antithefij of I
the mode of voting viva voee. The constitution I
expressly prefers the former to the latter. But you i
and your fellow candidates havfc fuperceded the for- â

fy to be forefetn that pe: fonal enmitiea woald be en-'
gendered, animosities excited, and vialent
contentions provoked, which alternately ter- â  1
rninate in civil commotions, and therefore, the vote
by ballot was preferred in order to guard as mucfi as
possible against those evils. Who that itcolleflsthc .

the prudence of those who formed the confutation, <
Â» endeavouring to prevent an exhibition of fimilar
fcerits in this country ? Who that admires this pru
dence, but mult regret that tha conltitmion has â 
been evaded and defeated in this refped i But the i
peepk-, it is laid, are in fault ; they have required 1
the candidates to be explicit. The people who, to

not only wrong but wrong, must follow. Nor let
