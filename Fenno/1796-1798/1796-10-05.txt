Mr. Price, . ,
I read fomc time ago in your pajicr, a publication
taken (rÂ«m the Dumfries Gazette, announcing ,
: of Charles Simms and Daniel iCarrol Bkent,
)N- as candidates at the approaching-election ,
ft>f an elector of a president and vicc-prefident
of the United States, for the diftriA -of Ptince {
, William, StaiFotd and Fairfax. The writer very
' properly'obfervei, that both those â¢gentlemen are (
highly refpcdtabltf, arid I belicrc nojuft exception (
ean be taken to the private charadier of euher. It

"ant t ' )e choice of t"hediltrift mr.v fall. This, however,
' it far from being the cafe arid the public-gocd is t

â¢If there had heretofore been any 3nubt on the

grefs have demonftiatcd to all America and to all i
ne '" Europe, thfit there are two parties unfoitun^tel)'
existing tn the United States, totally oppoiire in ( |
their political opinions ; in a few words, they may ,
be defined to be the " Friends" -and the " Enemies" 2
; t p. of the govern men t uniler which \vÂ« live with such J
:nce unequalled comfort andprofptiity. The friends of
â¢ of the government are composed of those who origi-
nally supported the cohftitution, and of those who,
having in the beginning eppofed it, have, from ex- |
-in perienctng the happy effects of its operation, become
do- its advocates. Among the enemies of the govern-
,nf - meat, very few will be found who did wot oppose it

THE CÂ»urt having considered the evidence and
argument* adduced by the counsel for the petition
ers and refpondentsare of opinion, that there is not
j.jiScient cause to admit the appeal of the petition
ers from the decree of the court of admiralty in
lhe state of South-Carolina condemning the (laop
Chcfter her apparel and cargo. If the appeal
ftould be admitted, it must be on this principle, that
there had been such irregularities in the proceedings I
a that justice and right required, that the cause I
should be reheard in order to da that jultice here,
hich had not been done in the court below. The I
( regularity suggested is, that the captor* did not I
kring or fend the mailer of the captured reflel in I
order to be enquired of touching the property Btc. I
ji ,ir prodace the document mentioned by the matter I
in his protest, and that for want thereof a con- I
' mnation had taken place. However blameable
i t captors may have been in omitting to fend or I ,
! ing the matter before the admiralty court, and in I
not producing said document, such omifiion alo.ne 11
not fufucient to set aside the dccree arid rehear j .
t :caule, unless it appeared that substantial justice I '
11 j been thereby prevented.. In thas cafe upon an I j
imination of ?11 the evidence produced, it appears I
it the condemnation of the (loop Chester must
r re taken place if the fame evidence had been of- i'
td in the admiralty court. Peter Theodore Van- |
t engen appeals to have been a merchant in a Bri- I
i i settlement in the Bay of Honduras I *
laving a tranfiant refidence,but carrying on trade f
m that settlement like other inhabitants. It is
ii..c material to whom his natural allegiance was due, I V
h was enjoying the privileges, and fubjedt to the 1
i . anvenitnees of other merehents residing in the '
le place. The (loop Chester appears to liavf I 3
n a British vessel poffelfed of British papers. v
â¢chafed by Vantylengen and employed by him â¢ r
1 although he might have executed a.b'ill of sale I v
c her to certain fubje&s as the United Nether-
ds with whom the United States were at peace I !
ud amity, for the pnrpofe as he expresses it of pre- I
'ting "her being taken. Such a t/ansfer cannot
â  considered as bona Jide, but from the tenor of the J
ructions of the said Vantyfcngcn to the matter I "
- the sloop, that transfer appears to have been in- I
ded Merely to, deceive and cover 'under the nafhe I
a friend, praperty which ought to be Considered J !"
hat of an enemy. Examining the protest made jls
v the master of the sloop Chester it does not ap. n !
ir that he was prevented by the captors from go- I V 1
;to Charleston, but on the contrary, his going 31
â  (bore at St. Euftatia, upon the privateers leaving j w
it place, seems to have birrn in confrtjucnce of his J --
'<> foliciration. Foi these rtraions the coUrt do I
t admit the appeal of the said petitioners; and it j m
considered by the court that the petition be dif- I w
ilTed ; but as some irregularities on the part of I .
e captors have given colour for the petition, the
'â¢curt do not award coll* to the respondents. J "
