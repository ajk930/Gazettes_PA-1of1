the rising to the letting fun.
Heutauit Lamcrville.â" If yon do not
_ adopt the measure proposed, yaur
fete.s will poflefs neither power, nop majelly, J
norattraflion, nor any thing else than the
fVadow of existence. The article on the
celebration of marriage eftablilhes the "rea- i
tell of our inllitutiona. Of the three great !
eveues of )ifc, birth, marriage and death, it
0 . i* marriage which Carries with it and deferres j
:e 'he greatcft degree of solemnity ; and it is I
th act which operates most llrongly on the
lenses and the imaginations of men. We
hear of the inconveniences which would at
tend marriages being confined to the decadi;
but before the revolution were marriages ce
lebrated every day ? And if you attend to
individual inconvenience, you oppose ohfta
â Â«les to every general measure."
The Council then proceeded to the dif
9 ' cuflion of the firft articleâ
" That the decadis and days of National j
Festival? shall be days of repose throughout
the Republic." 1
' Grand Molfonâ" It Teems to me, that 6
i something more efficacious ftioul :be adopt- ''

God, in idleness and floih.
" Thus, the inhabitants of the country
. ar; obliged to observe the feftivals thirty-fix
decadis, and, forced by the Prieft6 to keep
holy the Sundays, are n-flrained froai work
for more than a third part of the year.
< Vigorous measures muli be taken. It mud
be decreed that all feftivals and religious ce- â 
remonies fliould be performed o>i the decadis, I(
For too long a time has the sceptre of the 2c
cross pressed upon the French people. It is 3<
time to reli eve them from the chains of sana
ticifm, as they are already freed from the .â 
fetters of rafalty. Refer all ceremonies to
ihe decadi. and the people, impatient of the Â° r
yoke of the priests, will celebrate them on ?'
that day. Let the priests who refufe to ! n
corapiy be pini/hed, and their magasines of lS
teltcs (hut up Let them be confined (o
their fanftuaries, and if they choose to fay
thetr prayers their own way, we (hall not eo

This may eafdy be made more particular
by comparing it with the feconl feftion of
} the tax aft. It appears, for the confolati
e on iif the poorer fort, that the palace worth
t 5. sooo dollars, is to pay Jive t'mes as much
3 in proportion to its value as the cottage
f is worth only 500 dollars."
t 1 busâSuppose there is in Boston or
Philadelphia, a mechanic, whose house and
} (hop are worth 500 dollars, he will pay a
V'X of one dollar. Supp'ofe there are 500
such mechanics, thfy will, of course, pay a
tax ofsoo dollars.
Suppose funher, that one man owns a
house a ;d out buildings worth 50COO <!ollarsÂ»
ne will tl en ha*e to pay n t<ix or 500 dol
lars , that is, he will pay as r<.-at a tax for
property worth only 50,000 doikrs, as tlie
500 mechanics will pay for property worth
250 000 dollars.
Or thus- My neighbour's farm house
1 and birn are wor h 500 dollars ; my house
' and bu ; ldings (and I am a farmer t >9) are
I worth 5000 dollars ; now my neighbour
i will pay a tax of one dollar, and I a tax of 25
' dollars : that in I shall pay as grÂ« atÂ»a tax for
property worth 5; 00 dollar*, as 25 brother
, farmers will pay for property worth 12,500 1
1 dollars.
1 Aud if the pilace of the great and illus
trious Farmer of Mount Vernon is worth
, 50,000 dollars, he will pay as gr at a tax
tor it as 50? other farmers of the above dc
fcription, wll pay for property worth
250,000 dollars.
Tlie toi eyeing statements (hew clearly
tftat the federal government have confnlted
the interest of the poorer clafles of citizens
and have aimed in this, as indeed they have
in all their fifcal laws, to draw the public
Revenue from the purses of th* wealthy , and
if there is a jacob n, or Frenchified Ame
rican, who now bawls against the tax as bur
thenfome to the poor, I would beg leave to Â«
warn my fellow citizens to be on their j

Extract of a letter from an American in
Spain, dated September 18, 1798.

TRANSLATION
Of the Letter from Lower Saxony,
September 26th, 1798. j
(Continued.) (
Â«Â« Let us not too badily credit the news (
which already represents Buonaparte in ex- j
tremc didrefi, which declares that he has
keen repulsed by the cavalry of the Beys, |
retreating towards Alexandria, entering that | t
place, and there entrenching hitnfelf as in |
the only post which is tenable against his
enemies for, although these reports are j
fubfequeat to the accou nt which announced a
his entry into Cairo, it is difficult to suppose
that, being matter of that city and of all ,
lower Egypt, he should have tuftered such
a rcverfe as to occalion him suddenly to re- j
treat sixty leaguesâapd that, with chosen o
tlo.ips, the bell artillery of Europe, and
fkili'ul taftics, he should not have been able t
to maintain his fird advantages against the Â£
Orientals, but little aceudomed to war,
without taftics and without artillery.
"I am IVnfi that there are situations in j t
w ich valour and skill must yield to numbers, 'â 
that the bt(l artillery may become useless in j
vast plains ps fan*J*jnd that European t*c- 1 ti
tic* may be oifeoncertcd by the (hock of 1
those enormous mafies of cavalry, which the f j
Beys, in their forces, will alTemble. .
I likewise the French have ene- j
mies to combat in Egypt much more formi
(table than the Beys, and againtt which {1
neither valor nor ta&icS can availâthe cli-
mate, pedilenee, and famine. But let us t|
admi' that Buonaparte has succeeded against -
these enemies, and that the bell part of E
gvpt has submitted to his powerâDo you Jj
bulieve that he has not been weakened by t j
the enemies over whom he his triumphed ? ,
Do you believe that, his communication j
with Europe being henceforth entirely cut :
, off, he has nothing to dread from the dif- t j
contents of the country which is fubjefted ; j f a
nor from the Beys who are flill in arm's ; , u
nor from the forses of the Grand Signior, ()|
become the enemy of the Republic ; nor 1 u ,
from the diseases, which will desolate his \ n(
army before it,is seasoned to the climate ? Ij,
" The hoftilitv of thÂ« Grand Signior, and
the imprffibility of receiving succours from
Europe, mud inevitably prove fatal in a
country whrre he cannot recruit his force.
A month ago we might reasonably have e f r "
doiibuH th* hgftib'ty OmuJ fltgm'or. 13
Every thing led to a belief that he approved,
or at lead permitted the expedition of the t,
Frenchâthe confidence with which they
failed to Egypt, the pains taken by their 1
friends in that country, the appartnt indif- j
ferenee of the Divan, and the total inactivity j P.
of tbeTurkilh Minister, who saw all their C '
movements at Paris, without demanding Zt
any explanation from the Divan. But there 01
is no longer either indifference or inaftivity
on the part of the Ottomans ; and while the a |
Journalifls remark that the Turkilh Minister
at Paris wears an air of fnrprife, the French
Agent at Conftantirople is tr u'y aftÂ«nifhed
at thÂ« vigoroUi measures of the Porte.

Although the adtirefs to the French nation,
' relative to the recommencement of hostilities Â£ a '
in Germany and in Italy (which want of" lu<
room prevents us from mltrting this day) is of
a symptom too alarming, not to give room l ' lt:
: for fuppoling the probability of such an event; ed
1 and notwithstanding the movement of troops an<
1 towards the Upper Rhine and Switzerland, tJlc
â¢ of which the advices from Strafburg contain lov
the details ; the friends of peace ought not
â  yet to renounce all hope of feeing it renewed ed
at lead in Germany. In giving an account bac
of the augmentation of the forces at Kehl, ret
Auenheim, and upon the whole border of the
Alsace, the fame letters from Strafburg an
nounce, not only that general Schauenburg Ex
has not yet entered into the country of the
Grifons, but also the probability that he will
not enter it, in order not to furnifh a mo- we
tiveof rupture to Austria, who has declared yea
that ihe will consider that step as a declara- wil
tion of war." Another motive for believ- ing
ing that, in spite of preparations each day pel
more menacing, between the French repub- the
lie and Austria, neither party has yet renoun- Fre
j" t " e . continuance of negociations, is the dan
difpohtion, which is about to be made, in and
regard to the place of envoy extraordinary of Sea
r ranee to the Batavian republic. These the
funchons are about to be confided to citizen cout
Lombard (cf Langres) formerly member of cur
the Convention, and now judge of the 'J'ri- at a
bunal of CafTation : he let off the day be- twe
fore yesterday for t!ie Hague. We infer Ott
from thii, that, this pod having before been fpei

ago to have done ; the Emperor has found,
that the inlidious villains, while contending,

- were aiming only at the demolition of his
whole Empire. He has wifely resolved to
,f be beforehand with them, and to strike, him.

which themiferable people of Unterwald have
been subjected to : those of Sweitz have been
1 obliged to deliver up the principal chiefs, who
{ had caused it to take a part in the infurrec

the rcfideiu of France, Frorent Guyot, has
quitted it : he is at Ragaz, in the diftrift of
Sargens, cant9ll of Lintz. It is neverthe
less apparent, that the fatisfaftioa which he
has demanded, involves hostilities, of which,
in the present conjunfture, it would be ex

will be accounted amongst the most aftonilh- tj

political combinations, which wander from jj

French revolution has hatched in great abun

and well-equipped, coming from the Black S ,
Sea, palling before the Seraglio,and traverfmg .)
the Canal, to enter the Archipelago. The
coup d oeil was i'uperb ; but it was yet more JT

at an event, which they would have resided,
two years ago, as fatal to the interest? of the
