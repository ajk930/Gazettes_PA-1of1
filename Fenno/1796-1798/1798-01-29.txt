my dirty to tnske this public acknowledgment of

similar complaint. 1 had been afflicted with a moll 2
dreadful althma for about twenty-three years. I
never for yearn got any;,reft, my cough was fa
troublti'oire in the night; and used to discharge aa It
jimoll incredible quantity of glutinous matter 0
jnrpm my lungs ; and my breath was so exceeding g
ihert that I could not walk aerofs my room. PrÂ»- tc

of Land, one half of which is under wood, the other
very fine arable Land, producing the best Hay ana

fully proves the*excellency of the metal, which it

lately made, although some of the 24 were bored

manufacture, and a place of arms lying in the ftatc

tage that can result from a plenty of watet issuing

ITTHEREAS frauds havr been praiftiled, in '
VV obtaining Warrants for Bounty Lands, due
to the Officers arid Soldiers of tile late Continental
Army, by the prediction of forged intlrumer.:..
To check in future such impoDtions, it has beeri
thought advifeable ; that all perfohs, having claims
for b,ounty lands, whether in their OWII right, as
legal rcprefentative, or by virtue of any infli um'rnt
or deed of transfer, be required t<J forward their
rsfpeitive claims to the War Office, on or before
thefirftday of January 1799 in order that such
claims may be duly examined, adjulled and deter
mined upon.
To fubflantlatefuch claims, obfetvance of
the rules heretofore iflued from th* War Office will
be indispensable ; and in addition to what is requir
ed by the said rulfts, tha certificate of the acknow*
ledgement of a Deed or Power of Attorney, must
also set forth the plate of refiJcnce and occupation
of the claimant or person making such acknowledg
ment ; and when the pioof of personal knowledge,
is by a witness or witnefles, their place or places of
residence must be set forth in likq manner-

To tie green vine, that twines its rifilefs fides ;

The mole's dark orb, the lynx's quenchless eye ;

The lein-deer fleet, that flams the prmtlefs plain,
Ttiecouchant snail, that shuns his weight in vaia ;

From whose dread mound no errant gholls return ;

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Del/ate Â«n Foreign InUrcwcfi.
.[Conuujie-l j efterday'a Oaief.e.]
TUESDAY JANUARY 23.
Mr, FiNDLJjY believed, if the amendment
under confideâ¢*'"" hail been argued only
upon its proper ground, its he
(houlc not have troubled the house with any
obfei nations upon it; but this ground had
beep, widely departed from. The arguments
of gentlemen who supported it, had not on
ly bl*en mifapp'veh'ended and miltated, but
they thcmfeltfw had been charged with the
vftfrll o( indentions. Jif had fat a whole
feflion in 'Congress, and not heard so many
; jn.'freprefentatioDs, and so much play upon
| words, as he had heard in this debate.â
j Though Ije did not poffefsthe eloquence and
; delivery of other gentlemen, he would, at
; least, endeavour to set them an example of
candour.
It might have been fairly argued whether
it was now expedient to narrow the extent
of our diplomatic corps. This, of itfelf
would have absorbed a pretty large field of.
discussion, and upon this ground, he sup
posed the questions which came before the
house, were determined upon the principle
of expediency. That the queftion-
Hands on this ground was acknowledged by
gentlemen on different fides of the house ;
for it had been admitted, by those opposed
to the amendment, that if the President
were to appoint a large number of ministers
(an hundred had been mentioned), the house
would be juftified in refufing an appropria
tion.
The gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.
Grifwold) had said, that the constitution,
declared, that th? President (hould have the
power of appointing to officeâbut that the
fuppotteis of' this amendment declared the
contrary. This was misrepresentation.
The queltionfoas not who fhouldbc appoint
ed, btir whk offices {hould be retaiaedâ
and he always understood it to be the pro
per business of the legislature to inftiiute
offices, and to fix the salaries of the per
sons who (hould fill them, but no farther.
The constitution gave to the President the
power of " appointing ambafiadors, other
public ministers and consuls, judges of the
supreme court, and all other officers of the
United States, which (hall be established by
law." There seemed to be a diftindtion be
tween officers appointed by the constitution
and officers appointed by law. Foreign mi
nisters and judges were officers appointed by
the constitutionâbut did the Executive e
ver appoint a judge before his office and sa
lary were appointed by the legislature ? No
more than he would pretend to appoint mil
itary officers and ambafiadors, whose offices
were not fixed by law. But it was yester
day said, that Congress had nothing to do
with foreign intercourse, and that they had
no right to investigate it. He was surpris
ed to hear this. Was not the power of de
this power no way connected with our inter
course with foreign nations? And if the
power of declaring war was in Congress,
were not those powers also placed there
which Ihould enable them to judge upon the
propriety of such a measure ? They cer
tainly wereâsince it was not expected that
power (hould be exercised blindly.
But the committee was told, if they ex
ercised this power, that they (hould flop the
wheels of Governmentâa favorite expression
of a favorite.author. How was this to be
done? If the doctrines of gentlemen op
posed to this amendment were to prevail,
they would at least Jlop the -wheels of this
house. But it was stated to be the intention
of those who advocated this amendment, to
check and counter-check the goverment, un
til they (topped it altogether. This was a
novel declaration. Pie believed the doftrine
of checksas farashad been stated, had been
imported, because he did not believe the
Aborigines knew any thing of it ; but if
the governments of this country were trac
ed to their source, it would be found to be
interwoven in them all. The patronage oc
casioned by appointments to office, had al
ways been a feriousqueftion in forming both
(late governments and the general govern
ment. In some states the power was divid
ed between, the legislature and the Execu
teâin -rrthw ftatcs, the jealousy which ex
isted in this refpedt had placed the power in
the legislature. Were it necessary for him
to give an opiftion on the fubjedt, he (hould
have no hesitation in declaring, that this
power was improper to be placed in a legis
lature: and that by placing it there, in en
deavouring to avoid one evil, they laid the
foundation for a greater.
When the constitution of the United
States was under consideration, it was well
known to those members of the committee
who were present at that time (and some he
saw), that this was an important question. '
It was thrown into different (tapes, until at
last it was adopted as in the constitution. â¢
This regulation was adopted upon principle !
and was not a mere arbitrary thiiig. The
power of appointing to office was brought '
down by placing a part of it in the legilla- j
ture. It was farther reftrainad, by prohib
iting any member of the legislature from eu- '
joying during the period for which he was !
eledted, any office which (hould have been '
cieated', or the emoluments of which (hould
have been increased, during that time. Thus !
holding up so vi'pv the avenues by which
corruption was malt likely to enter.
But they Had teen told the President was
a check upon the legislature, the senate up
on the President and house of reprefenta- !
tive ; but that the house of reprtientatives
had no check upon the executive. If this j
was the nature of our government, he mult
own he wag ignorant of. it, though it was
well known hp had been pretty conversant
with it since it had an existence. He be
lieved it was not without reason that the '
P ewfr of originating moncv bilh was â 
v ' a !
placed io th'c house of reprefeiftitiees, j
which was an effectual checlc âHe was ear- J
ly led to this opinion. When the cotfft;- (
tntion was under confederation, ttii; was as- |
ferted, by men well acquainted with the |
fubjedt, as an effedtual check ; though it i
was also predidled that the day mighc ai- j
rive, though it was thought to he very tar i
diftanr, when it might, be considered other- j
wife. he was ferry to find, thit day 1
was now coine, so much sooner than it had,
been predidte:l,
In the year 1796, our diplomatic inter
course was firft ejjarged. He then voted
for it, not because he was convinced it was
necessary, but because "he tad not an op
portunity of knowing it was not nkeftary,
and he therefore tnilicd to ex ecu'
ment ; not Vt:at he considered hiinfeif as a
mere machine, and that hi w;f?souii<? to ap
propriate, because the Preiideirt ISftl'fcnt
an edimate to the hoiife. This dodtrine
was not then avowed, if it had, it would
have (lartled the house. He voted it as a
temporary measure ; and he did not think
if the appropria'ion was now withheld, !
that the house could be charged with en
â  tering into the executive ckV, and with
doing executive business. In order to keep
the fubjedt completely within the power ef
congress, the law had been passed only for
two years; upon the fame principle ' that
the law was passed with r*>pedt to a (land
ing army. I~le therefore submitted it to
gentlemen to determine which was the new
dodtrine, that in support of the amend
ment, or that produced agaiaft it.
In order to support th* npceffity of min
isters abroad, gen'.lemen had dated it to be
their business to watch the proceedings of
foreign courts. That this might have been
the cafe, he had no doubt, but he believed
we had had no proof of this watchfulnefs
of late. He feared tiiey were more fre
quently employed in forming plots with
which they had no business. We had a
minister at a certain court, he said, and
though an order was iffned vthiVÃ" placed
our commerce upon a most"dangerous foof 7
ing, yet we never heard "ot" it, utitil we
heard of its execution. Upon the whole,
he believed ministers refitient were equal to
any business we had to do in foreign coun
tries, and a salary of 4,500 dollars, had
never been Complained'of as being too low ;
as to what gentlemen had said about other
nations fending ministers to this county,
and.that therefore we ought to retura min
isters of the fame grade to them, this could
not be a governing principle with this coun
try. We had to conlider our own advan
tage, and let foreign nations attend tÂ©
theirs.
But it was observed, that no branch of
government was to be supposed capable of
abusing its powers. This was contradicted
by the constitution, for it had guarded a
gainst this abuse in the executive. Gentle
men spoke of this amendment as calculated
to injure the President ; he did not fee how
that could be. Refufing to appropriate
money for any objedt which he were of o
pinion ought to be effedtcd, could be doing
â¢ â¢ : 'fit were, tie had hffn
injured during theTunntrerTeÃiony as con
gress had declined to adt upon feveral[fab
| jedts which he had recommended to them.
The gentleman from Delaware (Mr.
Bayard) in speaking of the vnconfiderable
nature of the patronage of our executive,
to (hew there was no danger to be apprehen
ded from an extension of it, compared it
to the patronage of the crown of England,
the ejtenfive source of which he did not
consider as dangerous, but as necessary to
preserve the monarchy. To hear this doc
trine on this floor, alloniflied him, as well
as the use made of it. Here, he stated,
the pratronge was not dangerous. Why ?
Because a greater was necessary to the mon
arch in Great-Britain to preserve his power
and he supposed, as a necessary conse
quence, therefore, it was necessary here, to
promote a monarchy I Gentlemen delighted
to dwell on this theme, and to prove that
all danger was to be apprehended, from
popular governments. It was his opinion
that it was necessary, in order to preserve
republican purity in our government, to
guard against the extension of executive
patronage. Pie might call to his aid to
prove this, the hHtary and experience of
all ages and nations, which would (hew
that republican governments corrupted,
were worse thtuiTnor.'rtTclueS: IJc iTJen took J
a view of the different popular governments
which had formerly exi-fted in Europe, and
(hewed that the spirit of despotism in the
executive had wholly deitroyed and a'ofor
bed the popular branch-s.
Ungenerous alluiion;,-, the tendency of
which he did not understand, had been-made
against persons from fon*jn countries. It
had conftant policy of this coun
try to admit as citizens, after a certain pe
riod, persons from all-countries. Our con
stitution and laws admit of no diftindtion of
citizens. Why, then, was it now thought
to be dishonourable not to have been born
in this country ? If this principle had been
introduced sooner, he (hould have been saved
some trouble ; for lie, though born in a fo
reign country, had been elected by the citi
zens of this country to tran(aÂ£i their legis
lative business for_ many years, and he did
not think that they ever conceived their re
presentative would have heard it insinuated
in this house, that he ought not, on that ac
count, to be confidertdupon the fame ground
with other members. Left th's sentiment
lnould not have had its force, it \*as repeat
ed, dating, that cur danger did not arise
from foreign correspondence, but from the
importation of foreigners. He did not know
what all this meant, except it were to des
troy the harmony existing between the citi
zens of the union, who were of all coun
tries. But in connedtion with this, some
thing had been (aid which seemed to fliew
the aim of gentlemen. Theft persons were
called enemies of government, and were
charged with making attempts to overset it,
and even this amendment was ftafed as be
ing intended to have this effedt. He aflccd

- from Mr Brent) yeSerday, confined

3 a , nd exhibited it in a let, formidable flnpe tlan

But the gentleman wished to limit the patron

> that tins power had been abused ; hut having no
r ground of this kind togo upon, tliegeut eman had
, invented a number oj theories of his own,unfanc
. tioned by experience, He dated that the/orÂ»
j of a government was of little conl'equenee For
_ his part, he thought the people of this country
were well assured of the importance of a repub
lican form of government, so conftruaed as to
a preserve its purity ; but now they were told*-
vry thing depended tulely upon tlie execution
,f of a government.
,f In support of this principle, the gentleman
had affeited that executive patromge wis more
dangerous in republiian govemmeuts ihan in
monarchical ones. If this were true he wasmif
informed by hiftury. There were few goveru
d meets in the world, which partook of the re
iV publican form ; he knew none, but those of this
e country, Great-Bruain, and the prefsnt govern,
ment of France. All the other gorernments
with which he was acquainted, were either nio
Â° i archies with some or
11 " bad taken place in
the European iiad btl . p r â dot . cJ
(- by repi-clcntative bodies. hTe mitaiued the re
volution 111 France, which he (taredas being pro

from his difficulties. But the gentleman trcm
' I Virginia, he ftaied, had said that the liberties of
"(the peopla of England were in greater danger
t I thin if they had no representative.body ; but he
i, ; believed the reform of that government from an
t | absolute, to a limited monarchy, had been occa
-0 ! honed by the people. So soon as reprefenta
_ j tives ofthe people were admitted into the go
vernment, the reform began, and continued mi
til it became muck more benefieial to the j:eo
> pie, thdH it had befoie been.
? He wished to examine into the faft wJiether
- the republican governments were not preferable
r to any other. He believed that this country
was indebted for its independence to the repub
lican governments of the individual dates. If
0 it had not been for thennhebelieved these dates
would still have been a colony under Gieat-Bri
t tain. But by the people having the privilege of
1 eleifling enlightened citizens into their legifla
-3 tures, who were aware of thedifadvantagesun
â e'er which the country laboured from being fub
je<St to a power, this di fad vantage was
3 ihewn to the people, and it produced a spirit fa
â  vourable to independence. He had therefore
1 adopted a different opinion from that avowed
f by the gentleman from Virginia ; he believed
r a republican government, the best poflible go
government for f;curiag the liberties of. a cniwi
' try. rk'^eTtifteci rt'gh! be'abufes in re*
publican governments, as well as others; but
' no fail had been adduced to (hew that abuseÂ«
' exided in our gox-ernment; nay the gentleman
; from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin J acknow.'edg
. Ed âand he was glad to hear the acknowkdge
ment âthat our government was as yet tolera
â¢ bly pure. Why, then, go. into raeaiures to pre
vent mifchiefs, which are unlikely to take
plaee ? But it was said these mik hiefs were to a
' rife from the power of theprefie'ent to appoint
to office. It was tru;, the prefideut had this
â¢ power, but it was also true that the senate par
. licipated with him in that power; fothatifa
p ny patronage attended it, it was divided between
the two departments, aad, it could not hefup
pofed that the senate, composed of gentlemen
ofthe firft talents from the different parts oft if
1 Union, would be likely to misuse this power.â
i They were a check upon the prefidrnt, and there
- was no need of any other.
But danger was appreht'ii 'ed from the prefÂ«
â  dent's appointing,to cffic-., only men ot uptn*
| ior.s conl'onan f to his own. He thought the ar
2i;ments of gentlemen hjd been foiOtV'nat rr.il
ftated on this ground, lie had heard no gen
tlernan contend, that if there fnould lie a vacan
" cy iu an office, ami a perlbn of ability and in

entertain Irnne opinions difierent from thole Â«.

. of the ddff,iniflration had been wroi.;',
tl-at, on that grourid merely, he fhonld be re
: 'le&ed If thev did, he should not join then..
' His opinion was, however 1 , that if there"*ere a
set of gentlemen averse to every moalure of g< -
â¢ vernmtnt, to whom it was fufiiÂ«ient to know
. tbat ,1 twliMf* was recommended by the execu
tive, for li.ern to condemn itâthat these gentle
men ought not to be appointed to office; as it
niivl.tbe fiippofcd that fucli persons would
r tkrr retard, than assist in the execution of the
' meafurts of go\erwn?nt. FÂ«r irtftatiee, fop

colleA thoSe taxis ? Certainly Â» Â«r, ihey j
create an'oppo itio . to the govcrntti&n , l>y rea

But it was laid the preference of men of cer
tain opinions, ;f the bufineS o? foreign ininif
ters was continued, might hive an improper in
fl #:vce upon the. menders of the teg:flitare.
He thought few gentlemen in Congr.fs w;re
capable of being operated upon by an exp:ilj
tionof appointments to oHi.e ; bcft lci, it the
preGdent vfere toafl cbnfifleotly witli tiie piin
etplei which gentlemen attributed to him, he
would not chul'e gentlemen from thence who
werea&ivt in lupport of executive meafure9 ;
he would rather u ilh to retain thc.n in tlieir
present fixation.
To tholVgeft'lemen wlio thought confqls were
equal to every b ilinefs which we hid to fettle
abroad,he wou'd %y, that the duty of confoils
was well known and defined, lÂ»y pil 1- |jift ; it
only relates to individuals of this country wha
might have occasion to go to foreign countries,
ar.d who might require affifbnce from them.â
There was iio instance, he believed, of any re
prefrillation being made from one government
to another, by means of consuls. .If it were ne
ctlTary to have any such representation made, it
was proper, therefore, to leave the bufinel's in
the hands of the prelident and fenate-who would
best determine to what place miiiilteri ought to
?'Â» lent, and what (hnuld be their grade. He
fhou!d, therefore, voteagaii.lt the amendment ;
and though fonie gentlemen might vote in favor
of : t, thinking that it did not iurerfere with the
constitutional p-jwer of the executive, yet it was
his opinion, if it were voted upon the ground
stated by the mover of it, it would iaf-iiige up
on those powers, tr.ore especially aa the gentle
himfelf had declared, that though he did
not mean it present, to attenip' an overturning
of the whole diplomatic Corps, he meant to do
it at fame future period

years of his age, the Hon. LEWIS [MOR
RIS, Esquire, Major General of the Sou

were interred, yesterday, in the Family-

Col. Steddiford's regiments, performed the

Though philosophy would teach us that
as death is inevitable, the certainty (hould
ever reconcile us to the event; yet, when
Worth and Virtue fink to the tomb, we find
the human heart triumphing over the cold
precepts of this philosophy. Affection will
dwell with delight upon the departed worth
and will heave the sign ftho'unavailinS) for
it's loss. This tribute from the pnblic and
from his friends, few have bettermerited than
the deeeafed.
From the public he received distinguished
proofs of confidence, having been (in the
.'ii.tivil department)a member of the firft cob
grefs who voteÂ® the- of
â  ' United States arid for a number of year* Â«
member of the senate of this state.
In the military, rose through the va
rious grades, to the rank of major general
of the southern division.
With his friends he was highly edeemed,
for he possessed those qualities which render
the friend truly valuable. To an uncommon
degree of chearfulnefs of disposition, were
united as genuine philanthropy and hofpita.
Jity, as ever graced or warmed the bosom of
man.
With the grief, therefore, ofhis family,
for their bereavement, will be joined the sor
row of the public, for the loss of a good ci
tizen ; and of many individuals, for a wor
thy and much valued friend.

. Jaquemel Ambler had passed the 55th
year of his age; without a blemish to his re

for himfelf, and that he was mature in char
' after.
' Notwithstanding the constant exposure
of an official man to the displeasure of others
t by the impartiality of his conduct, even
those, who went away from him unindulged
t in their applications, were fatisfied by aeon
-1 tidence in the purity ofhis motives. His
' public cjreer for nearly tweuty years was a
e series of tcftimony to this truth.
Drawn from the peaceful walks of life in
r -to public aftion, without a solicitation, or

His fatal disorder put human nature on the
rack; but he bore his agonies with every

f_ ber 1797.
, n " I find Holland in general in a tranquil
situation, both with regard to politicks and
ie trade: while I was at Rotterdam the adtion
; 8 was fought between the fleets which termi
.. nated in the defeat of the Dutch fleet with
a the loss of 10 ships of the line: no naval ac
tion was evet fought harder, or ended in a
more compleat victory ; the relidue of the
fleet has reached the Texel, and the govern
;e ment is preparingto refit it,yet this must be a
â work of time, in the mean time, the naval
s dominion of England is uneoutroulable by
i e â  any power. TheconveHtieu-are engaged in
forming a new constitution, which will be
ie ' brought forward in the course of the win
c ter; at present the government may be said
y to be completely under the influence of
ts F rance > though that influence cannot move
it to adts of violence, nor will the great
mass of the people be turned from a cpol
ar >d steady attention to their intcrefts: in
forming a peace I do not undertake to fay
how far the independence of the country will
be deftroyedby France or England, but I
3) rather think its trade and existence as a cen
j. tcr of wealth and exchange is so necessary
a to Europe in general, that no measures will
y betaken materially to injure them by either
-t P ar ty !, the war has already done immense
d '"jury tÂ» the country, particularly to Am
e fterdam, by diverting its 'radeto Hamburgh
e yet this.must eventually return and I cannot
c but think tnat the very advantageous situa
tion of both Airifttrdam and Rotterdam
will forever insure great business to them
both." ___
A gentleman of this city, just arrived
from Charleston, informs, that he there saw
a letter addressed to citizen Godard, late
chancellor of the French consulate in that
city, by citizen Maneonrit, dated Paris,
November 9. In this letter, citizen Man
. gourit informs citizen Godard, that he is
f appointed miiftfter plenipotentiary of'the
French republic to the United Btates, and
. only waits the termination of the conferen
ces with the American commissioners, to
set out for the place of his defoliation. He
g also requests citizen Godard, to proceed to
r Philadelphia, and there wait his arrival.
