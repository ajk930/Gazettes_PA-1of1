" I fin.cerely rejoice at the acceptance of

" A declaration that the Federal Govern

MR. FENNO,
t LAST autumn in travelling through part
of Virginia I frequently entered into con
versation with gentlemen whom I occasional
ly mt?t at the public houses, on the fabjeft
ttie Alien Snd Sedition Laws, and particu
larly wlien from their dialect I di(covered
them to be foreigners. I generally observ
ed to them, lam sorry to hear you are so
greatly alarmed at the late alien law of the
' Uivioll /tla> med (was their invariable an
swer) no such thing, you are totally mist form
ed ; we are under no apprehenftm from its ope
rationâ.We have truly much rcal'oll to com
plain of (late laws and state tribunals, but de
pend upon the faft, 'tis the Virginians atone
Wiit complain of the alien laws. Now Mr.
Printer, I desire that some of your wiseacres
will account for this enigma.
A STRANGER.
Only an Election Tkigk.
However unwilling the democratic faction
*nuy be to admit any circumstance that tends
to disclose the interested views of those whose
lips constantly dwell upon patriotism, whose
amor patria; centers infelf, it is no lei's a fact,
that on various occasions they are compelled
to hare recourlc to persons whom they can
not imitate, to support their characters as
they are ; i. e. they are necefiitated to bor
row the garb of virtue to conceal their own
vicious deformity. To this cause and not to
the united .fuffrages of his fellow-c'lizens,
are we to impute the fucceiiful termination
ot a late election in a county not fifty miles
from Philadelphia, in favor of Â« candidate
whose duplicity swerved many well inten
tior.cd persons from their determined purpose.
A few weeks the election, at a
t;me when the genius of Columbia had call
ed Opoa her ions to reiift oppreilion offered
from abroad, and to crufli a growing faction
at homeââthis.disciple of Gallatin, knowing
that a majority of the electors were with ad
mmiftratioli, even to their livesâartfully in
linuated that lie had just (then) returned from
an interview with the Prdidentof the Unit
ed States, at which he had tendered his fer
yice, to act in any rank he might be thought
deferring ot, and that his nam* was actually
placed on the records of the Secretary at War.
But fearing least this would not fully support
his prete . Sons to patriotism and not trading
to his ulual trumpeter, (a democratic magif
tl ate, ho, it I mistake not, is from the tur
bulent nation) he boldly declared that during
the American revolution, he was intruded
with u command andftation, which placed it
in his power, to have forever disconcerted our
measures, to have buried our brightest hopes I
in ererlaftlng night! Can it be, that he
whole wisdom and reiflitude were fuperior'to
evei , alTault of fortuneâCan it be, that
Waftiingten the great, the good, would trust
an individual with the holding of a balance,
the nice ft turn of which would have decided
th â¢ fate of America and pofteritv ? Sav, ve
e'der Sons of libertyâye whose breads ne
vei- cherilhed one traitorous idea, can this be
io ?
But mark, thÂ£ eleftion over and the can
didate having thus seated himfelt in a cliairof
State ; his friends fay it was on'y nn eleSkn
riclâhe Ins not seen the Prefideat, nor
would he take the trouble to alk anv thin
of hhnâ'Aihapi.il'.> Utt&r a.Tertion may be
tour, Ito b.- as "ufidLisjs his friend* now
lay the lir:l is f .he.
But 011 examination it will be found that
lie has made application for a military em
ploymentâWithout prefunting to dictate, it
might not be aitlifi to searCh into the real mo
tives of a man whole political opinion has
long niii counter to- the wile measures ot
adminiftratiouâWhole individual opinion
may be proven to be unfriendly to the 1 icli
dent und theC'r.rr.nander in Chiefâand whose
public confeiKon now declares, that he yet
retains in idea where and when he might (Ju
das like) have betrayed our country's favjour
.vfth a kiss. S.

Jkl low-Citizens,"
ON Friday next, the 21ft inftartt,.vou will
again be called to the exercite of a 1110 ft im
portant and intercfting privilege, for the pur- j
pose of choosing a perl'on to represent you
in the State Ijegitlature, in the room and
stead of John Hufton, El'q. who has resigned.
It is at all times highly essential, that you
should examine with candour and patriotism
the qualification* of those men who solicit
your fulTrages'for stations of trust and re
iponiibility :âat prcfent, however, when the
honor and prosperity of our common country
are at stake, it is peculiarly
you, as free and enlightened citizens, tS~tfi{-
criminate, with jealous circufllfpe&ion, the
pretended from the real friends of the go
vernment. On a fubjec! of such imineni'e
moment, then, I trust you will listen to me
with serious and profitable attention.
The active enemies of the Federal govern
ment. who leave no effort of opposition un
tried however often foiled, are determined, 1
at the ensuing special election, to support,
with their votes, the difgraccd and Contempti
ble Gk.okge Logan ; a man whose recent
conduct you are all convinced delerved, as it
has received, the unqualified censure of every
honest American; and who, by a long series
of Opposition to government, has proved his
inveteracy to all legitimate authority. Citi-
Izens of Pennfylvtmia, you live in the cen
tre 01 political informationâyou cannot be
ignorant of the unwarrantable and prefump
tuoas interference of this manâyou cannot
view, but with indignation and .contempt','
this feeble infect crawling frorn nothing
ness, and aspiring to .the confidence of his
country, without a particle of merit, or a
, single aft of lervice to recommend himâ
Your known discernment, yaur active patri
otism, your love of public virtue, your re
spect for the laws, all conspire to render him
del'erved''y odious in your estimation.
Even had this man, in the assumption of
a diplomatic character, effected an aftual re
conciliation, 1 the unwarrantablenefs of his
authority, the arrogance of the undertaking,
would delerve your severest reprobation ;
and the terms of pacification, however favor
able, coming through that dirty and illegal
channel, would be rejefted by a people free
and independentâFrance having no right
to prescribe the qualifications of our minis
ters, we would concede it. to her* if-we ap
peartJtHeTeaft thankful for the exertioire bf
this importer. Biifc he has done nothing to
wards a reconciliation, even if we were incli
ned to avail ou'rfelves of his euibaffy .He
has visited France apd returnedâthe fame
has been done with as much effedt, by many
of our captains of vefiels and seamen.
Under these considerations, fellow-citi
zens, how does your own reflettion impell
you to aft ? To elect him, will he to func
tion his infamous presumptionâit will be a
stain on our stateâa reproach to the general
government of the United States, and a
temptation to others to follow his footfteps.
Ixrt nie conjure you, then, as you love A
der, as you love freedom and independence
as you esteem the present happy government,
resist with unanimity and spirit, the unreal
pretentions of this candidate for your fuffra
gesâl recommend to you, Benjamin
Chew, jr. a gentleman, in every refpeA ca
pable of representing you with ' justice and
credit. Jm

A FACT.
One of the M-Leans, wlio a few months
ago rendered himfelf conspicuous in Canada
by his jacobinical conduit, has made his
escape to one of those western counties of
Pennsylvania long since famous for harbour
ing Disturbers of public Tranquility.
s.
EVERY editor of a news-paper accompa
nies his proposals to publilk it, with a pro
mise to be impartial. This was ut firft un
derftoodto imply " being open to all parties."
The public were however early denied a lat
itude so great as this. Impartiality is not
violated, it is now conceived, if fafts are
justly.stated, and no necessary information
withheld, though admission Ihould be refuted
to all political sentiments opposed to those
which the editor may efpoufeâConfide ed
even in this reftridted sense, how many breach
es ot impartiality appear ; Claypoole's paper
of yefterdiy exhibits a glaring instance of
thii. Let any one turn to it, who was pre
sent at the debate on the resolution for print
ing and distributing copies of the Alien and
Sedition laws, and read that debate as.given
bv hijn, and he will be struck with the justness
of this charge. The speech of Mr. Gallatin
detailed in the fulled manner ancj fecms to
have greater force than it reallypoffeffed from
being refined in print. While th- renly
made by Mr.Harper, which difphyed prom'ct
nefs ot wit, fertility of genius, and corrc'ft
neU ot judgment, is curtailed and mutila-ed
so that it jxtlTelfes non? of the manly feature s
which produced sprobation and deli.ht in
thole who heard it. 0
Friday, Dec. 14, ,
Extrafi from a Coup d'onl over the f.tnatior, ,
of Europe, contained inihe Speftateur 1
uu Word, a German periodical work, for 1
the month of August 1798. ,
It w.Sjiii the planÂ« of the Di'reftory that ' (
ijc AmÂ« f arc should pay also their tribute ; ;
e but titanic* to their fagacitv, and above alt
f to their si nation, they have hitherto known
how to difappnint these calculations; they
â t have even bÂ«*en able to obtai'i words of
fwctnefs and of iu place of that
t imperious and menacing language, which,
'â¢ a few months since, the Directory lield to
s wards them. You have fern the lingular
'f correspondence of the miniiter of foieign
n relations, wiih the envoy of America, who
- remained at Paris after the departure of his
e col eagurs. Ten have admired the able and
I honest politics of that miiiiltir who, being
â  unwilling to admit the Envoys inverted with
r a charafter and furnifhed with ample pow
ers, obstinately perfift*in recogniiing those
powers and that character in an Envoy who
no longer ack"owledget them himfelf.
You will have admired that delicate and
II scrupulous policy, which nQk loader wishes
i- Mr. Gerry to return to thepreliminary mea
- Jure of a loan, the idea of which never en
u tered into the pure views of the Directory.
You will have admired the frank and simple
I- policy of citizen Talleyrand, who wishes to
u negociate with all his might, when there
n are no longer negociators ; who speaks of
the alienation of the DireÂ£tory, when for
'* three years the Dire&ory has abused the a
:C lienation of the Americans; who wishes,
y in fine, to use all mcsnt of avoiding a rup
-11 ture, and of preserving peace, when France
l " for five years has made war upon America.
- It would be difficult, fayÃ Mr. Gerry in his
'* letter to the minister, in find in the hiffori of
â  c civilized nations, any examples approaching in
' e cruelty to the depredationr, the outrages, and â '
the sanguinary atrocities, exircfed by the
l " Fraffy upon the commerce and the citizens of
the ak&pd States. It is after such a war,
> that they insult the patience of the Ameri
cans, by reproaching them with their alien,
ation, and to whom they presume they have
rendeied ample jullice, by publifiiing a tar
:t dy anvte against these cruel and plundering
v corfqirs, of whom they have lo long com
-15 plained.
The vigorous measures taken by the U
nited States, will, \ .thout doubt, contri
bute more to the protedtion of their com-
J ' : merce, than the phrases of citizen Talley
rand and the atrete of the Directory. But
' L both these last have only labored in their
M vocation, while endeavoring to disarm those
â  ' -enemies they could not debauch ; while la
boring to avoid a war which may hurt, and
which cannot enrich them ; wile seeking
~ to heap on the Americans, all the odium
of a rupture; and to fortify amongst them
the disorganizing party which menaces their
11 repose.
You may qualify as you please the con
dud of the Direftory towards the t United
â¢ States. It will- be eaSly judged of by all
sensible men, afld I perceive that it has been
'] appreciated jaftly -by even those who mod
' faror the principles of the Trench govern*
