The celebratt d general Bowles, the Creek

between-each The fa.ndy fliore being le
v 1 with the sea; you fee nothing of the
beach till almcit in the harbour, which is
>cry precarious, being little flickered an<d
very rocky, the bottom so much so as to
make it ntceflary to utrder-run eveiy cable,
and to moor opposite caitle with four,
Iwo a-lf*ad, two,a-ftern, lafed to others as
far as yaur anyhow are cirried, and a buoy
los some fort to each la/hitig. Thus every
cable crofting each pther, form quite a net,
and would employ one (hip's company twp
days at lead to anchor { but it is a rule to
fend from the fliips in harbour as many met?
as can be spared to affi't the Â»ess 1 coming
in. It is fc> exposed, and thers is so much
[well sometimes, as to cause great confuljon
*i;4 eii3refs, lb ps to itrike lowef yards
and top mails, and if one anchor draws home,
there tye often ten or morej as they hang
on each other and the only chance you
have to lave a (hip and qavgo is to cut and
run out torfta. No b ;Sts*can come off or ,;
land at this time, nor wjlithe Turks try, as
they yyilh to fee your Qiip lolt, in hopes of
plunder. â â  There is very little provili an to be
had of any kind ; water is so scarce JOU are
obliged to buy it at a dear rate, and the
Turks, if you are not mindful, will put in
(a't Water to i icreafethe profits. The Al-,
exandrians are efteemcd the mod thieving

Mediterranean, though there are a number
of (hips of different nations which trade

! REVIEW OF THE LAST SE&Sid ;
OF PARLIAMENT.
From a late English paperâC included.
. â There are two other leading articles in
the ways and means of the yea , which hive
j compenftted for by defalcation in the pro
duce of the new assessment, and which each
t of th<;m tend to give to Europe and to the
j world, aju t and proud imprtffion of the
j real chara&cr and lituation of the country.
At the eery moment of railing, within the
r yearj in the unexampled mode which we
have dated a fnm of'betwec* four and five
j millions, by acompnlfory taw, the Voluntary
zeal and liberality of individuals has already
5 added a sum of certainly above a million and
j- .a hilf, and probably approaching to two
millions ftcrliog.
As a lolid pecuniary resource, this free
r will offering of a grateful a-d contented
' People, may be faftly weighed in the ba
lance againll a year's plunder oftherevo!u
---j tion, ry armies of France- But if it is va
f luable in its amount, how much more so ft
j it in iV principle ? How much more so is it,
as a pledge of affection to the fotereign, and
" the conltitution ; of Zeal tor the country ;
of confidence in the government ; and of a
determination to ttlake private facri
ftce in support of the national interest ? Ne-
ver did any hdtioit fp;ak its geiiuinc fenli
s mems in a language more likely to confound
the hopes tjf those enemies who threaten to
3 attack its security from abroad, oi* a tempt
to disturb its tranquility at hom.\
1 ht other article to which we is
g the temporary tax laid upon our commerce
f for the support of the war, with the general
and zealous concurrence cf all defcrjptioi.s
of merchants. A tai of this defcriptipn,
j founded o:i the immenfc increase of our e>-
} ports and imports during the war, on' our '
? undilttirbed possession of the principal for
r reign market?, and on, the complete naval
protcdtion afforded to this txteaLive trade,
fpesksat once the spirit and good sense of
our merchants, our unexampled Hate of com- !
mercial prosperity in the midst of an ardu
out eonteft, and the unparalleled vigilance
a .id aftivity of our maritime deftnee.
Thefe meafuves have had the effedt of
" r 11 ewing at opce tlfe power, the resources, !
s and the determination of the country, Th'ey
have naturally prevented, under all the crit
e ical scenes which have been pafGng. any de-
preflion of jhe public fu. ds; and they
e have enabled government (at the very time
when the means of borrowing were laid to
be exhaufled) to complete the supplies by a
r loan of fifteen millions on terms the most
* favourable to the public which have ever
r been obtained. *
The attention of parliament has not, howe
ver, been confined only to the new mode of
fairing the fupplie< for a tingle year. The plan
for the sale of the land tax, and for applying
the>produce towards the reduaion of the nation- i
j al debt, though vehemenily oppoi'ed by a flfw j
. persons attached to their own peculiar opinions, I
1m bsen clearly proved to he attended with no i
- possible inconvenience to the public, or to inJi- i
â¢ viduals ; and its progredive eperition (besides j
e fumilhing a conliderable direct jjecuniarv ad-1
Â«rtrrntrpTTOfn:) BSSTs trie moÂ« tiirrrt ten
a dencv to aid and flrengthen tbe operation of
the linking fund i to diininilh ( and as we fruit f
t rapidly the amount of funded debt in the mar- I
ket ; and to facilitate future loans, and furni/h ;
a additional and increasing means of exertion, in
t the event of the continuance of the war.,
While we have thus effectually provided the
j pec-niaj-y means of maintaining the eonteft,
the military efforts, and inl'.erVnt spirit of the
# nation have n>jt been less conspicuous in
r ing to meet and repel every poffihle enterprise
, of the enemy It cannot in.iced be doubted,
that even before ourincreafed prepirations, any
| attempt at an invasion of this illand mud final
f ly have terminated In ruin and confufion to those
who undertook it. But conlideting the charac
, ter Â»f our enemy, cirelefs of the lives of its
r own fubjedls j iuveteiate in its hatred of this
. country, and maddened at the vie* of our pros
perity ,- intoxicated with its futcefs on the con
j tinent, incapable of quiet, and unable to mais
j tain at home, its vidlorious armies. There was
, a period when this wild and desperate project,
j was not unlikely to be I t would not
mattered to them, if, directing their e*-
" t pedition againtt differeuP points, three-fourths
of it had been intercepted'and destroyed on the
palTage, ptovided there had been a chance that
) the remainder could effeift alanding, before its
llrength (then, not prepared as at present) could
be fufficiently colleiled to overpower tliem. â
Perhaps too, the falfe and impudent exaggera
! tionsof the few desperate incendiaries who with
: to introduce French principle* among ua, might
r have really deluded them into the hope (which
they at least profeffed to entertain ) of finding
auxiiliaries and confederates in the bosom of this
country. But even these vain and ill
lonnded as they were, exist no longer. '
s The impotent malice of the difaffe&ed
i has beeu exposed and detefteO. The found
r part of the community is completely on its
- guard. Almott ev-ry man who has pro
. perty, is armed to defend it ; and the fidel
; ity and loyalty of the great mass of the na
? tion (untainted by all the pernicious doc
-1 trines so induftrioully propagated) is as ma
; nifeft as their courage- When the threat
I of invasion was firft ostentatiously announc
- ed, the army of England formed, the con
. queror of Italy appointed ,his commander,
, and his 4ivifions begun to be aflcmbltd on
- the extensive line of the coast opposite to
1 this country, from Br ft to the Texel, the
a whole armed force of every description (ex
i eluding the supplemental militia and pi ovi
fional cavalry, neither of which were then
i embodied) hardh- exceeded one hundred
3 thousand w/en : and a large proportion of
Â» this force was raised only for a local defence
of particular diftri&s. The additional force
which has cither been raised, or trained and
r embodied,'firice that period, has augmen:ed
. our means of defence by at leatt 150,000
;, menâabove half of them voluntarily ee.roll
: ed, and fnpported without expense to the
s public, and almost all of them applicable to
1 service in any part an attack is likely
e to be made.
s It is not, however, so much from the ae
. tual amount of our armed force, or the ex
. tent of our preparation, however treat and
, unexampled, that we are ta calculate our
, strength and fecuritjr. The military spirit
Ule public zeal, the jtrft national pride, and
tLfe n.cuty cud well grounded vaÂ»fidence
wliich pervade and animate all clafles of so
ciety } these are what really cotiftitute bur
defence; and in the. midst of the degrada
tion and inifeiy of so large a part of Enrope,
bi.ve taught oar prefimptuoua enemy, that
there is at lead still one nation, yv'.ich can
neither be feductd bv their intrigufcs, nor in
timidated by their menaces, uor subdued by
their power.
In Ireland, the at the period to
which we have referred was indeed alarming;
and the critis which ba9 linee taken place
hat been anxious and awful. But many as
have been the cal-j ritics which have been
brought on that country, and deeply as they
mull be regretted, this severe trial has per
haps proved its fafety and deliverance. The
,-ttat ktagdoÂ®, fq far behind us in
m infers, civilization, and indultry, nutwitff
ftanding iis rapid improvement during the
last twenty years; thtr volatile character of
its inhabitants; together 'With the circum
(tance of there being so few refidcot propri
etors, and any ofi that intermediate
order which forms the link and connexion
between ti:e higher and lower clafles of so
ciety: ail tend to .It them for the reception
of those jacobine principles which foreign
em'ftaries and domellic traitors have long
been labouring to infufe. These arts had
been too fuccefsful. The associations of
Ur.ited Irilhtnen, formed on French princi
ples, known jto be in dired convfpondence
with the enemy, placed under military direc
tion, and sworn to the extirpation of all
that was rcfpe&able in the country, was
kiiown to be spread through every province
iÂ» Ireland, and in maoy parts to be rapidly
iticrcafing, They held out no particular or
fpecific grievance; they aimed at no limited
reform of any real or pretended abuse ; but
at an ablolute. separation ftom Great Bri
i tain; at the plunder anH coi.fifcatian of all
property; the Jefliuction ef the whole
frame of government, and the ere&ion of j
a jacobin republic Ufder the aufpecies of
j Franc*. A4d they *re eagerly waiting
for ihe moment when the co-operation of
French force, might enable them to make,
a great and concerted .effort for the execu
tion of their design. Happily before such
j a co-operation was attempted, unexpesftcd
discoveries led to the seizure of fume of their
principal leaders, and hastened the explosion
of the plot. The struggle has indeed been
severe; and, decisive as are the fuccelfes
which have been -obtained against the prin
,cip 1 force which has appeared, we can
scarcely yet pronounce "that it has finally
terminated*. But me fee enough to consider
it as a circumstance of the firft importance
to the empire, that the crisis was not delay
ed; and the events by which it has been at
tended, give us grounds of courage and con
fidence, which had never been afforded to us
before.
In addition to all this, the prompt and
efficacious aljiftasfce from Britain; and the
' alacrity, zeal, and ardour with which the
m'litia and fencihles of this kingdom flew
j to the defence of their fellow fubjecls in
j Ireland, forms an sera in the hiftorv of this
Country, from which >i/e may conlider the
I strength and security of the British empire
: as augmented beyond calculation. And we
! cannot help indulging the hope, that this
(ingle circumstance is capable of awakening
sentiments in both countries, which, when
the present ferment is subsided, will unite
them more and more in the closest ties of
affectionate connexion.
We have hitherto contemplated what has
passed in t>oth kingdoms, with reference on
ly to our domestic exertions. To complete
the pidttire, we (hould turn for a moment to
our naval operations during the fame period.
In the midst of the menaces and preparations
of invalion, we have fesn all the principal
ports of France, Spain, and Holland,
Submitting at the fame time to be blocked
up for months by our fleets, without daring
in any instance to oppose them. Instead of
being at liberty to detach an offenfive expe
dition, they have been unable to convey
Ihips or stores from one part of tkeir coalt
to another. Scarce a friga'c or privateer has
ftolenfromapy of their harbours, which has
not fallen into <Mr hands One of the chief
points fcletfcedfor the colle&ion of (heir in
vading force, has itfelf been the. objeft of
our fuccefstul attack ; and their prepara
tions, through the whole line of adjacent
coalt, have been, in consequence of it dif
candnutd. Renouncing their boasted eÃter
prize of invasion fiom the coasts of the chan.
nel, they have turned their great effort to
the MeJitteranean. and in that remote quar
ter have fried out a mysterious expedition,
which they Hulled would at lead have scope
to aft without molettation from our navy.
The issue as well as the obje& of this enter
pnze, is yet uncertaiji; but we fee them al
ready trembling for the event They know,
that with a secrecy, promp.itude and ener
gy never exceeded, at the very moment when
they thought themftlvcs molt secure in that
quart;,-, and were menacing the British and
lrith costts, a squadron suddenly dispatched
from Ireland itfelf, has enabled Lord St.
Vincent to fend a force to the Mediteiane
an, probably fufficient to disappoint this
great and boafled effort* and perhaps to add
another brilliant trophy to the long faries
of naval which have raised the ma
ritime chara&tr of this country to its pre
terit proud preeminence. Purlucd and turi
prised in the; quarter whete they least ex

PORTSMOUTH, Oct. 13.
NAVAL ARCHITECTURE:
MVITPD STATES. .
The Editor of the Oracle feizcs tHe pre
sent moment to jnform his patrons and the
public, that on 1 hurfday [aft, at a few mo
ment* pad 1. p. m. a most beautiful copper
bottomed twenty gun ship, called the Ports
mouth, and built Tor the feivice of the United
States, was launched from the Continental
Navy Yard, Langdon's island. The launch
was conduced on the belt principles of the
complete Slip-builder, and the (hip deposit
, ed in her future native element not only
wiilÂ» ftfety, but also with that peculiar
grace, w'.iich commands the distinguished
applause of the right worthy tar. John
Adams, efqr. of the Revenue Cutter, bade
her welcome to old ocean by a federal did
charge of'fixteen guns; John Wardrobe,
efqr. of the private armed Ihtp Cato return
ed the salute; and an immense concourse of
attendant citizens manifefted their pleasure
by repeated huzzas.
The Portfmauth is to be commanded bf 1
Daniel M'Neil, efqr. of Boston. an expe
rienced and valuable officer, wâo has done
honour to himfelf in every farmer flation;
and, whose naut.cal knowledge and various
talents are the surest pledges of not difap.
pomnng the public confidence. Captain
Richard T.bbrts, of ,hi, town, is appointed
firft lieutenant; capt. Georg, Turner, jun.
second lieutenant; and capt. Robert Oram
sailing-master; thyee excellent officers, who
cannot fail of refle&i K g credit upon their
feycral appointments. The keel of the above
Ihip was laid on the 4th day of July last
past, a happy presage of supporting that
; independence on ocean, which her courftry
| has maintained by land. She has been com
-1 plelely buiit, coppered, and launched in the
(hort period of eighty five working days.
The dimensions of the Pwtfmouth are 93
feet keel, 31 feet beam,- and (he is pierced
for 20 guns, but probably will mount 24,
and me as a 1 ght frigate, ot {loop of war.
The Portlmouth was built cf the bed
seasoned timber, under the dire&ion of col.
James Hacket, United States' Naval Di
reiftor, and beneath the fnperintendance of
col. Thomas Thompson, age;.t of supplies,
&c. These two gentlemen have repe.tedly
diftinguified themselves for the goodness
of the materials, excellence of work, and
promptnefa of execution. The able ftiip
wrights of New-Hampshire, guided by their
fkiltul hands, leara the true enthusiasm of
labour, and refled the highest honour upon
themselves, as ever faithful and true.
It merits an additioaal record, that within
thr confined ipace of fourteen months, a fix
and thirty gun frigate for the Dey of Al
giers; an elegant Revenue Cutter Â®f 16
gnns ; and the beautiful (hip Portsmouth of
20 guns, all been laid at the keel, and
finifhed for the water in the fame yard.
Capkau M'Neil expels tor fit his (hip for
lea by the 1 It of November.
It is to be hoped that the jolly tars of
PortfmoHth, and the hardy marines of our
country tÂ«wns ; will volnnt-er their fefvices
on board, and that monsieur Talleyrand will
honour captain M'Neil's bills at the fight of
his guns, and thus pay a pait of the debt
which the terrible republic owes, to :mi in
jured, an inlulted, and too loug a patient
ajtd forbearing country.
SPIRIT OF SHIP.BUILDING.
On Monday next, Jacob Sheafe, efqr, as
public agent, and col. Hacket ai naval di
rector, unitedly raise in the fame navy yard
a fix and thirty gun frigate, to be complete
ly finifhed of Irvc oak. And such is the
contemplated fpiritof enterprize and energy,
of indaftry and exertion, that said frigate is
tt> be launched in 230 working days. When
every circumltance is maturely considered
European uavy yards exhibit not more ex
pedition in build ng; and the fupcriovity of

THS TWO FORTY FOUR GUN SHIPS.
.. A gentleman of the firft refpectab.'lity and
information has aflured the editor of this
paper, that the two (orty-fuur (hips,
building at New. Fork aad Norfolk, are
progiefiing with the greatett fxped tion,
and that bo'h of them will (hortly join their
niaritime consorts, who are supporting the
honour of the American flag, and protecting
the commerce of an nnjultly intuited, and
inhumanly plundered neutral, independent
nation. A writer in the London Gazette

It is dated in an Englilh paper, as a re- att

him. It certainly is so far pro- noi
bable, that the views of the French upoa Co

Lord Cornwalli* cannot too much so
plaud the zeal and spirit which has been
manifelled by the army, from the commence
ment'of the operations against the invading
enemy, under the surrender of the French
forces.
The perfeverasce with which the sewers
supported the extraordinary marchts which
were necessary to stop the progress of the
very attive enemy, does them the greatest
credit ; and lord Cornwallis heartily con
gratulates them on the happy issue of their
meritorious exet'ions.
The corps of yeomanry, in the whole
country through which the army has passed,
have rendered the' greatest services, and are
peculiarly entitled to the acknowledgments
of lieutenant, from their not having
tarnished that courage and loyalty which
they difpiayed in the cause of their king

The executive business, which at your last

arms of every hostile power.
A letter from his Excellency the Govern- ' o

has been received, and will now be commu- f,

|_ importance, will gain your early attention ; ' J
,f and which, I trdtt, Will obtain such prompt
concurrence in your decisions thereon, as the (
lt magnitude of its object appears to merit. u
Differences still fubfilting betwe#n tbe '
y United States and France, all our vigilance' a
, e and activity -will be required to guard again ft (
the arts and arms of that haughty aud in-] 5
j triguing foreign power. Situated as the | 1
j United States are, the arms of France are I 1
0 not to be dreaded: but their arts of fedue- j I
tion, and their intrigues at division and dif- [ 1
a . union, fill me with appreheafion and caution.) J
, n With those arts they are indefatigable and 1 .
â powerful; in tbefe, they boast their fuperiot 1
(lcill among the nations; like the intrigues '
s _ of Philip of Mscedon, whose political arti
ie sices employed againlt the Grecian States,
_ did more towards ruining their liberties and 1
power, than that artful prince, in any other
way could have effefted. With this ancient
to example on otÂ»r minds, as well as the very
recent and melancholy experience. of modern .
n . European nations fegforr our
0 f TSUgFvt the necessity of guarding ourfelvea
p. the fatal effefts of foreign intrigues,
:d P ari 7 fpitit, and divided opinions. Let hs
:( j conltantly bear in mind, that if ever we are
1( j reduced by the power of Frar.ce, or subju
gated to her will, or that of any other im
th P tr 'Â°Â° â  yoke, it miift be eiFedled by the arts
of disunion and division. A divided aud
at disunited p.-ople cannot be a happy people ;
jj. nor can they maintain themselves in an ho
as nourable or defenfible state. Let union be
nd our polar star to guide our conduft, and
crt true national independence our objeft, and
,p. the efforts of the world cannot prove fuc
ity cefsful against the power of this happily litu
:a_ ated country.
A thorough csnviiSion of thejuftneft of this
idea, and the awful danger and fatal effedU of
disunion and division, will form my apology for
dwelling on this fnbjedl. Among numberless
other artifices which at this time are brought in- :

3 Th* grift mill is a handsome, Rcwand well fin 1
ifhed building, of 50 by 30 feet, 3 stories high <
- ana iurnifhed with a run of excellent Burr stones
5 and another of Efopus' {tones, of the belt quality
. âand the mod approved limits, &c. calculated to
makÂ« all the different qualities of flour for axpor
r tatisri or for horneconfumption : It is acceflible by 1
1 water from every part of the Cayuga lake ami Se- 1
' neca-river, as well as from the Seneca-lakeâ-an<i
from its situation, conmands a veryextenfive and
- encreafiug coftom : The dream on which it stands, j
: being the cutlet of the Stucca-lake, the mill can
never be in want of water ; and as it has bsc-n kept
workieg during the fevi_relt season of rho lail win
ter, it is not liable to be impeded by frofl :
The saw mill is also new, situate.: on the samÂ«
â¢ ftrcam, now furnifhed with ail ample flock of
logs, of which a supply may at all times be pro
cured by laud or water, of the Lett quality :
l he dwelling houfc iÂ» well calculated for the use
of the miller, is new, and fulÃciantly laige : lhe t
barn is about 40 feet fqulre, and entirely new : ;
The portage is 3-4thsof a mile in length, along ' 1
the Seneca-fallsâover which were pasTed in the a
la* year, nearly two hundred boats with their f
contents ; this nbjedl is already produfirva of a
handsome income, which mult be incrcafing and
permanent :
Among the many advantages of thisfituition,
lAtlfl be numbered t!ie fertility of thefuriounding
countryâbeing the improved part of the coun
ty of Onondagaâthe concentration of inter-
conrfe by land and water, the Geneffce ftateroad n
pafHng through it, as well as all water carriage to
Geneva, and the counties of Ontario and Steuben ; '
which renders it a moll eligible stand for a Store or
Tavernâ'rhe river aud lakes abound in fifh and c
few! and the country with deer and other garue. 11
Besides the mills aiready ere&ed at this place, it e
iscakulafed for iuj additional water works that "
may be fnund neceff :ryâFulling Brill, bilk niHl '
tannery, firges, ic. maybe eredted at a faiall ex- r
