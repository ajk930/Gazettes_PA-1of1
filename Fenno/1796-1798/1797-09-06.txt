" According to English papers, Thomas
Paine, Hamilton fipwan, and James Nap
per Tandy were an in Paris on the 4th of
Julyiaft. The paragraphifts appear to ap
prehend something from the junction of
this trio ; convinced, perhaps, that the uni
ted force of these three honefl men in any
country are more than equal to the nefarious
machinations of all the knaves in the Uni
verse."
[As jacobinism has long been the sole paflport to
hooefty, in the opinion of Sintthefe may be
with him, three eminently ioittjl men. Though by
his italitifing this very delicate word, it may
be that he defigneda slur upon these poor patriots,
and 1 have mistaken bis meaning. Not that there
can be any doubts of the eenfummatc honefly of
all patriots. Freneau is doubtlcfs an bonefl man. so
is Bache, so are they all, all btnefi men. Every
man who seeks to fubflitute his own fyftcm, in op
position to the opinion of millions, for the already
established form, which they are attached to, is an
honed man and a good patriot! But some people
who are in more nice and scrupulous habits than
Mr. Freneaa, on thiÂ» poipt, will require other
qualifications than a pretended patriotism, for a
paiTport to their good opinion.
A curious lapfu in the above, deserves to be no-'
ticed . The latter part of the paragraph would
have been fufficiently reconcileable with his own
tenets, if he had applied it to EnglandâBut take
it as it flands, and it contains a clear inference, that
his three bomji men are in a land where all the
knaves in the universe arc collected. Unhappily
this is not true.] . â¢
POLITICAL REFLECTIONS.
When the eye wonders back into the his
tory of mankind, and beholds with what
savage ferÂ»Â»ity the nations of the earth have,
from the earheft of times, wafted ant} de
stroyed each other; when we observe the
sanguinary commptions of the present day,
and fee Europe, the mod civilized quarter
of the globe, drenched in tears and in blood
we are almost induced to credit the opinion
of Hobbes, that a state of war it the natur
al condition of mankind,
Let us firft, however, in*rrogate the
heart of man; let his faculties be analysed;
let it be enquired how far he is the creature
of education and of moral difciph'ne, before
we pronounce that natural, which be
charged to the imperfection of political in
stitution and positive laws. It will be found,
on a closer examination, that peace and not
war, is the natural state of man. The lat
ter, as may be demonftratcd from the records
of all ages, is the disease of society, genera
ted by the ambition of power and the lust of
dominion.
Amctfcans ! study tlje arts of peace. A
void as much as possible, any interference
with the politicks of Europe.âBeware of
the evil which so long has distorted the vari
ous government oftkeearth; and give lia
bility to the principles which fofter the hap- ]
pinefs and prosperity of fociat beings. Your 1
situation is truly critical. View the esifc of :
war. Deliberate wejl before ycnl tr.ake fi)e 1
last tremecdiÂ«u3 appeal of society. On yenr 1
government the hopes a:id the tears of man
kind have alighted. With fe\y exceptions,
indeed, it is built, on principles that are de
duced from the fitnels of things. Its dura
tion or its decline will prove to the world
the strength and virtue, or the corruptibility
and wcakncfs, of the human character.

As the attainment of an end depends much
upon the means made use of, the friends of
civil liberty throughout the world have
great reason to fear that the monsters who
have adted in the name of liberty for nearly
eight years,' and have deluged France with
blood and committed the most (hocking out
rages on humanity, will have left such an
imprefiion of (hame, horror and vengeance
C!t the minds bf the French nation, as to
make t'beÂ» throw themselves ifcto the arms
of perhaps <leipotfÂ£u itfelf, to evince to the
wofld that they had no participation in the
revolutionary crimes which ha7<? left an in
delible stain on the national charaftef. To
every person acquainted with the paflions of
men and the history of past ages, it is evident
that anarchy, carnage, and civil diffentions
await France immediately on the event of a
general peace, when the public mind no
longer occupied with foreign war, will turn
its thoughts within, and fee and feel the ef
fects of the devastations committed on reli
gion, commerce, manufactures, property and
morals, by men profefllng to be the apostles
of liberty and aÂ£ting in her name. The
deadly hatred and animolity which the dif
ferent faftions will feel towards each other,
will be produ&ive of the most dreadful anar
chy, and taking "the, history of past ages
for a datnm; it is not improbable that, tired
of the horrors of civil discord, and anxious to
rescue the national charadter from the odium
cast upon It by the sanguinary men who
have condudted the revolutionâthey will
seek for repose and national honor in the
arms of any chief who poflelTes their confi
dence. The abhorrence ofVthe French na
tion against the men who have carried on
therevolution,is increased by French writers,
who daily iiTue pamphlets reciting the hor
rid reign of the men of blood ; the tenden
cy of these writings in exciting detestation
of the men, will be to excite detestation of
their meafures-*-the event mull be obvious.
The following horrid pidturc ii set before
the eyes of the French nation, by the elegant
author of " The crimes committed during
the French Revolution." vol. I, page 72, a
work just publiftied at Parjs. Translated for
this Gazette.
" Ah ! behold the horrid pi&ure which
discloses itfelf to our view ! fee this land
strewed over with bloody carcafrsâtorn to
pieces, mutilated, beheaded ; these heaps of
bones, of limbs, of headsâghastly barrierâ
which eur crimes have raised between nature
and us : hear the doleful cries of the ghosts
of our vidtims, re-echo in the woods, in the
fields, and in the cities ; rife up from the
bottom of the sets,, frpm the bosom of riv
ers, from the bowels of the earth, and with
their mournful and revengeful accents im
plore the too dilatory thunder to fall on our
criminal heads. See the dead bodies of
those cnildrcn rc-a'nimated, rife ou the
breads offhfir drowned mothers, and ftretch
mg out their arms to us, Hammering ex
claim, " it is through you that we are or
phans." See them follow us, and in their
broken Ikulls, present to our burning lips,
the innocent blood we have died.' See those
bodies deprived of heads, press towards us,
cling round us with their arms, like so many
serpents, pull tis dotVn, roll us in the bloody
mire where our horrid impiety aba'ndoned
without thÂ« rites of iepulttire and de
cency. There, a head, stripped from the
reft of the body, rolls before us, bites at us,
muttering these words : " Butchering Le
gislators, what have you dim* with my bo
dy and limbs ? Whyhavayou thus murder
ed and separated us ? If yr a could
blood only quench your; thiril ?" Farther,
some arms, (hot off by our orders cling
round 11s, and by their menacing gestures,
excite the furies to torment us. Still far
ther, the genius of remorse, with a torch in
his hand, writes in letters of blood on tlie
sand : France, in naming a Convention, has
produced a movjler which males nature Jhudder.
Ah ! which of us will gue a mortal stab to
those people who continually hover about
us and a e forever befort our eyes ( tkey
make the earth appear barren and comfort
lefs to us, they rob us of the light of hea
ven, they co'ver the high roads, they darken
and render more glooniy even the forefts ;
they are round about usâthey are near us ;
they are far from us." " Let us appeal to
fadts."
" Will posterity believe that France, that
the firft people in the universe, should have
had a senate, which, during three years,
fanftioned all forts of crimes ; a
which, during 18 months, saw coldly, cart
loads of victims roll towards the fcaffolds !
Will our defcendents believe that it was
to all the cries of innocence, that some of
these fenntors went from choice to dine in
view of the places of puni(hment,*that the
disgusting afpett of revolutionary murders
was the prelude to the pleasures of the table,
that the fail of the aftaflin's cleaver was Aie
signal for beginning their orgies, that some
of those conscript fathers saw their broth
ers in the hands of the executioners and
never took a single step to save them ; o
thers who signalized themselves by denounc
ing them ; others, in fine, who delivered
them up to death with their own hands ;
that gambling and plays finifhed the day,
that their bosom companions were the judg
es and jury of the tribunals of -blood, rob
bers, spies, and the fans culotte Sultans of
the revolutionary committees, and to carry
our national shame to the highelFpitch, the
members of the commune were vile enough
to be the horrid engines of the mo'ft horrid
senate t]jst ever difgrpced the annals of hu
manity."
" Will posterity believe, that those pro
consuls, those Angels of death, whom sena
torial Tartarus vomited on France, were
ftnt to rob, violate, guillotine, drown, e
goi'ge, (hoot, demolilh yet this was their
million, the deftruftion of the human race
did not even fatisfy their rage ; \jhen men
were not to be found, they destroyed works
of artsâthe noblest monuments of human
ingenuity. Towns disappeared under the
stroke of the axeâflames effaced cities. O
posterity ! you will withhold your belief of
it! listen then, and tremble.
Â» The lame? of some of those procon- I
fills, you will find in the history, we (hall
leave you ; your aftonidied eyes will there
fee pieces, the authentic witnesseS of faCls
which we fnall only hint at here ; some of
those proconsuls killed with their own
hands the prisoners who made any com
plaints ; some covered with the dress of Re
presentatives of the People, mounting the
fcaffolds to harrangue x the unfortunate vic
tims about to die ; some cruelly, dragged
out women to be fpe&ators of the unjult
massacre of their hufbagtis; some threatened
to punish health officers, for having afford
ed medical afliftance to unhappy prisoners."
" Others caused citizens to be dragged
before tribunals or popular commissioners,
and said to the judges, " Condemn them,
or the fcaffold awaits you." Three judges
and one jurrie (or juryman) of the revolu
tionary tribunal of Paris, of the firft organi

f bound in this work of fix - volumes oftavo,
i which some other fnode besides a newfpaptr,

s men who were principal aftors in the bloody
, scenes above described, are many of them
? flill in power, and will continue to exercise
: authority over the French people till the
- avenging arm of national juftiee shall cruih
1 them. As Barras, who was president of
the felf-created, blood-stained Directory,
- when his man Monroe presented his letters of
1 recal, has become known by name to the
; citizens' of the United States, from his in
, fulting language to the people of thi* eoun
â¢ try in answer to citizen Monfoe's address, I
â¢ thought proper to give feme account of said
Barras from the foregoing work.
" Our colleagues Freron, Barras, Sali
cetti, Gafparin, Robespierre the younger,
and general marquis Delapeype,
law of Freron, have charged themselves to
attend to the (hooting 800 inhabitants of
Toulon, to guillotine all the federalifts of
MarfeiHes, as well as to demolish the most
elegant monuments of art in this city, and
to delÂ«ge with blood all the south of
France.' 1 "
Barras is the monster who was foremoft in
all the bloody maflacres of Robespierre
who voted for the death of his colleaguesâ
who headed the army against the fedtions of
Paris to force their acceptance of the prel'ent
constitution, on which day thonfands of va
luable lives were loftâwho owes his feat in
the Direftery to-the monsters whose feats in
the Legislative Body he secured by force
and usurpationâwho is a rank jacobin, an
enemy to peace in Europe, and a most bit
ter foe to the morally fubhnse heroes'who *
have administered ourgovernment,and whose
adminifl ration has been firm, pure, patri- *
otic and attended with a felicity which ap
pears incredible, when we consider the stu
died, continued system of disorganization
which has been praftifed in this country by
â¢every one of theagents of Jacobinism, Ame
ricans ns well as French. The moral charac
ter of Barras it notorious, the marriage tie
with him is an inducement to intrigue: lewd
to excessâ-he disregards the most sacred feel
ings of humanity when they offer a barrier
to the gratification of his lust.âYet not
withstanding the depravity of Barras, he is
the bosom friend of our immaculate ex-mi
nister Monroeâthey held together their
nocturnal orgies and midnight associations,
they " parted with regret," but not before
Barras gave his dearMonroe a farewell feafl,
to which a great mob was invited, and a
mong the reft an opera girl by the name of
Clotilde, upon whose entrance, Mrs. Mon
roe, and the lady of the Venetian ambafTador
thought proper to retire. It is well knowt>
that Mr. Monroe was on'terms of the great
est intimacy with all the jacobin party at
Paris, a party who are most inimical to peace
and to the United but happily for
the human race whose reign is certainly
'hort. Not with (landing Mr.iMonroe might
be in dangerof losing his head from -?ue mo
derate party who are getting the whip hand
of the Jacobins, for the decided part he has
taken with ttt latter, still lam glad lie is a- ,
mong us, where, if he is detested and ex
ecrated, his life will not be in danger, -nor
our national charafter tarnished by the igno
minious fate of one of our ex-ministers
Although the people of these ftatesjuftly
ascribe the embarraflmeats they have felt
from I'rench depredations, openly and cri
minally passive, if not secretly aftive, in a
great measure, totheconduft ofMr. M e
whi': in France, still to prove himfelf not
so abandoned as to be altogether loft to

come forward to disprove the charge made

/ In; Sir John Pringle's observations on the /
difeales of the army, 13 the following para- /
graph :â" According to the various de
grees of beat and moisture of the
the epidemic diseases begin earlier or later,
are oi longer t>r shorter duration, and are
attended, with milder or more alarming
fypiptqms. Wh?a heats come'on soon, ,gnd
continue throughout autumn, not moderat
ed by winds and rains, the season proves
sickly, the distempers appear car'iv, a'id

late, w! tempered by frequent uioncrsvÂ»ind< 01' if tVto nutiMr.nai void,; begU early,
the -'feafes arc few, their symptoms miLl,
and their cure easy."
The fi-ft is a -jirft description of the Hate
of the air, wcathir, and the effeCts of the
fame daring the Cummer and autumn of
179;,. and t\ie last of the pall ftimmer, and
that part of autumn gone by. The priÂ«f.
peCt is, thr,t in the remainder, ,we flinll
have early colds. What a call for grati
tude to the Sovereip;n Ruler of the ufliverfe,
for his diftifignfrhtng' naercy. to this city,
that we have, and do ttill enjoy such wea
ther and state of the air, as ha 3 hfen, and
may yet be conducive to the general health
of the inhabitants. What motive to con
tinue our exertions in keeping our houses,
yards, streets, and docks clean, and in co
operating with our worthy healtli commis
sioners, in the measures recommended for
preventing the introduction of contagious
diseases. We have reason to hope, that by
God's blefiing on our exertions, we may
escape the introduction of the yellow fever,
or should it unhappily make its appearance,
check its progress. A few inifances of
that, or of other malignant fevers, should
not be much cause of alarmâthe last has,
more or less, prevailed in this city for a
number of years part, and which is always
the cafe in populous cities, at certain sea
sons, and in particu'ar situations ; yet ex
perience has taught us, that by the use of
proper precautions, the effeCts of contagion
may be in a meafure counteracted.
In the year 1793/ while the yellow fever
was so mortal in Philadelphia, 'several cases
were introduced in this city, and although
mortal to the sick, few or none of the at
tendants on the sick, took the disease ; and
Svhile the fevei; raged in tW city in 1795,
its mortality was not extended far from its
â  fouree, with the removal of the sick to airy
situations. Should" contagious disease make
its appearance in this, city, which God for
bid, next to the most early application for
medical affiftancc, the following, has been
found very beneficial to the sick, and de
struCtive to contagion.
. " Removing the patient from places
filled with corrupted air.
" Correcting the air from which he
canuot be removed.
" Avoiding the accumulation of the
patient's own effluvia, by a conftani
ventilation.
" Frequently changing the bed clothes r
and body linen.
" Removing carefully and speedily all
excremental matter."
To which may be addedâ
Irnmerfing the clothing, &c. taken
from the sick, into cold water, but
by no means into hot at firft.
Removing all fuperfluous woolens and
cottons out of the sick room, and
every thing that may retain infec
tion.
Sprinkling, the sick room and houle
with vinegar.
Fumigating the fame with, the fmoak
6f gno powder burnt, brown sugar,
eafcarella bark or other odoriferous
barks or jtfftods ; a small quantity of
cinnamon bark burnt has been found
to changcthe air and smell of things
in a sick room, better and for a
longer time than any thing else.
The lteam of camphorated
warmed, is very good.
Cleanliness, especially, ought to be striCt
ly observed ; and if the room the sick are
removed in, had been previoudy whifre
wafhed, scoured, well aired, and dried, it
would have a remarkable good tendency.
Mr. Howard, while detained in the Laza
retto at Venice, experienced the most sur
prising good effeCts, resulting frosa white
washing the room hÂ« was in.âSee his ac
count of PÂ»g e 2 -
I could give you a number of instances,
in which air, efpecial|fy that most replete
with nitrous particles, fire and fmoak, wa
ter and vinegar, and lime properly applied,
have been found the most powerful agents
for destroying infection and contagionâbut
must conclude this long letter with one more
observationâLet the sick be attended by
none who are fearful of the disease, intem
perate, or indisposed themselves.
I remain, gentlemen,

BRUXELLES, July 8.
Letters from the Hague remark, that all
the best generals of the Batavian republic,
who are in th'e service, who are in the fer
tice, are aCtually at the Texel; and appear
ready to embark with 10,000 troops. This
circumllance, and the enormous > quantity
of provisions of all kinds, now on board the
ships, make us believe that there is an expe
dition designed against the Cape of Good
Hope. The Dutch troops discover great
aversion from this voyage, and some have e-
Yen refufed to embark.
BREST, July 1.
You believe there is prepared here, a for
midable armament; that we are going to
put to Tea a naval force of 66 ships of the
* line, like that of Count d'Orvillier, which,
in conjunction with the Spaniards, perform
ed such fine mancevres, and such little deeds
in the last war ; or like the invincible fleet
of Philip 11. or of Hoche, whicH were
both vanquished without a combat.
Your journalists make a frightful noise a-,
tout our thousand (hips, which are going to
cariV terrror and death to the shores of Al
bion. But this is the simple, mqdeft truth
âwe have 4 (hips of the line, 6 frigates, and
some corvettes. This , division will proteCt
that which i 6 at Bertheaume, and the arri
val of the convoys.
No one thinks here of the projeft of a ie
eon'l rlefcent. The prudence of the authors
of the firft does not shine in the diMers of
Bantry Bay. There is no doubt but there
are men, void of experience, and endued
with fufticieut presumption and folly, to puff
out projeifts of the Directory, at once mur
derous and ruinous ; but t!n;y will be ne
ceflarily restrained for some time at least by :
the weakness of our marine. With money, 1
sailors may be procured ; but there are not ]
more than 26 ships which can be / ferit from ;
Brest. Those which are begun to be built 1
are' exa&ly as forward as they were three 1
three years ago. v ou t h en t j, at we mu st ,

On Sunday afternoon, about four o'clock i r

flying artillery, and a detachment of the 1
Warwick fencible cavalry, to proceed to 1
Clacton. About five miles from their defti- <
nation, they learned that the men were all 1
taken. It appears that tHey were the crew I
of the French privateer; that captain Adams
of a Excise cutter belonging to Harwich, 1
had ran on (hore, and the crew had for some 1
time escaped. They were in number 24, 1
and were'conveyed with the vessel to Har- 1

STATE PAPER.
Answer of the Spani/h miiufler to a memorial
or rrmonflrance, presented by citizen Perig
non, French ambnjfador at Madrid, upon
the defeat of the Spanifb fleet, off Cape St.
Vincent, by the Britifb fleet. #
" CITIZEN AMBASSADOR,
" I have, with great reluCtance, laid be
fore the king, the heads and purport of the
memo'rial presented by your excellency, in â 
the name of the directory of the French re- '
public ; I fay the heads of the memorial,
becanfe the language it contains is couched
in terms so offenfive, so debasing, and so
infolant, to the ears of a free people, that
I deemed it quite inconsistent with the dig
nity of my station, to present it in the form 1
in which it ftcod, to an independent fove- J
reign.
" The king, fir, laments with great sin
cerity, the unexpected and severe loss which j
has befallen his majesty's arms in the late
engagement with the British fleet ; and is
naturally led in support of his own honor,
as well as the honor of the Spanish nation,
to make a becoming enquiry into the cause
of that misfortune : but he will not fuffer
for a moment, the directory of the French
republic, nor any foreign power whatever,
to.assume a privilege of interfering in the
smallest degree with the concerns of his
kingdom.
" It is true, as dated in the memorial of
your masters, that tbt r.aval arms of Spain,
have hitherto been eminently diftingui(hed
among nations, and on that account any hu
miliation at sea is felt'with' the greater force
and mortification by Ms majesty. But it
cannot but seem very extraordinary indeed
to the king, and to his majesty's subjeCts in
general, that the loss of'one aCtion should bÂ»
viewed as a matter of surprize by the French
nation ; surely, fir, the direftory ot the
French republic are not unacquainted with
the reproach of a naval defeat : they are
pleased to observe, that the Spanish flag has
fuffered a remarkable disgrace to its honor,
and that they as the allies to his Catholic
majesty, cannot with indifference behold
such turpitude. Are these gentlemen th"
members of the fame assembly, who embark
ed on board your fleet on the three memora
ble days of the 30th and 31ft of May, and
the lit of June ? Are these gentlemen the
commissioners who assumed the rank and
station of naval field marSials on that pcca
fien ? Who, before the commencement of
the aCtion with *he Britifli fleet, sent a fri
gate with ail insolent message to each (hip
of the line, viz. That the commjflioners
gave positive orders to the separate captains
that they were to fink to the bottom every
engli(h man of war, only excepting the Roy
al Charlotte, which carried the British com
mander's flag : out of their mercy, that (hip
they were to spare, but they were to bring
her fafe into the harbour of Brest, in order
to grace the triumph of the glorious new re
public but who, in the end, were glad to
make their escape from the cowardly Eng
' lifti, with the loft of nine capital ships : afid
are these the gentlemen who are prescribing
to the king of Spain, what jpuulfhment he
is to infliiS upon the commanders of the ,
Spanish fleet, for the loss of one battle,
while the En.glifh have in their pofTeflion
at this moment one half of their navy ? We
did not hear,' fir, of any punishment piro
pofed by the directory for 1 the dtf:r,t of
your impregnable fleet on the Ift of June.
On the contrary, it was afTerted in the so
lemn assembly, that for the arms of France
ever to meet the English in an adlion at Tea,
it was of itfelf fufficient, and equal to a vic
tory. I am stating here to your excellen- j
Cy, the history of three days only of the
naval exploits of your republic, but almost i
every day since its commencement might i
have accilftomed the eats and the eyes of
your dire&ory to the turpitude of naval de
feats ; therefore, previous to your excellen
cy's approaching the presence of his majef- : ,
ty, where you threaten to speak your opin- I
ion of the guilt of the officers ,who com- â¢
manded his fleet, I would advise you, as a
friend and ally, to balance the disgrace of
the two nations ; take in one hand the
lingle defeat of the arms of Spain, off the
Cape of St. Vincent's, while in the other
you carry the various defeats and difgrac/s
that have befallen the navy of the French
republic ever since the commencement of its
career, and fee which weighs the heaviest.
Your direftorv will then be convinced, that
for either of our two nations to attempt to
bring reproach upon the other, for their in
feriority to the other in naval skill and cou
rage, is nothing else than to arraign the Al
mighty Power, who has thought it good
and proper to grant the decided superiority
upon the wide antj extended ocean, to that
brave people. -
" The king, ray mailer, has, in the mean
time, commanded me to fignify to the mem
bers of the French republic, that whether it
be true or not, that it\'s the infirmity of go
vernments, as they state, to be seized with
certain cancers, which contaminate and cor
rupt the state,(it is not/his majesty's inten-'
tinu to follow the example of regenerated
France, by applying caustics and the knife
to remedy that evil ; for which reason he
has ncf occasion to fufpeiid, even for a mo
ment, the di&ates of his paternal affe&ion
towards the fubjeft of his own states, which
he is more than ever determined to cherish
and' cultivate ; being firmly persuaded, by
his own observation, and which is confirmed
by the hiflorical experience of all nations,
that no evil can be so great as to submit to
the tyranny s and oppreflion of a foreign go
vernment, nurtured and supported by the
very dregs of the lower order of society."

General KoscU'SKO, we hear, ha* lcf' the city,
on a visit to Genera! White, of Ntw.Brunfwick.
Before he left town. We understand, a gentlenian
in office presented him with a land warrjnt, to
which he was entitled by his services, and intima
ted there v.-as a sum of money due to him, for hi.
services in the cause of .this country. WÂ« under
stand that the General that whilll fortune
smiled upon him at home, he had no intention of â 
any pecuniary reward from the United States, but
thit, in his prelent circumstances, he should not
deoline, the acceptance of what appeared to be his
due. We believe that, with principal and inureft,
his pay will not amount to left than 18 or io.oco
] do'lars, as the Pel *al entered : nto the service Â» a
Colonel df Engineers, in O&obcr, 1776, and re
mained till th; end of the war. 7he land war
rajif, we are told, the General presented to a
Welch Farmer, of the name of Thomas, who was
a passenger in the fame ship, and of whim he had
conceived a high opinion.
A Jacobin wolf at Hull has bowleg over the ash
es of the great Burke. This i* N f'et in oppotitior,
by Bache to the honorable mention cf him in the'
j Gazette cf the IJnitrd States. Bafeas ate the Eo
| gliik Jacobins, they at lenfl are equalled in f.nliA*
by our own. No one will find any difficulty.
' therefore, iraffleeing with thecitizeu Editar that
it would be n: tural to fuppcfe the latter either a
fellow-citizen giving ver.tfto his leelir.gs at tlii

Kingston about the 2cth July, for WiU

test herfelf and the Dolphin from pirates.
Capt. Briggs fell in with these two veflel*
off Cape St. Antonio, and T>eing acquaint
ed with the captains, he ran close up to the
Recovery, and the firft fa'iutation was a gun
fired at him, and he was immediately or
dered to come to anchor, which he did with
all expedition ; but they dill kept firing at
him, and at lall boarded him ; they carried
him on board the brig, and there informed

volting against the mate and remaining A
mericans on board, and took poffefiion of
the brig, to carry her, as they skid, into th*
Havanna. They told capt. Briggs' the
mate had jumped over board to escape to
the other brig ; but from the blood he saw
on deck,'and other circumstances, he fear*
the poor fellow haa been murdered. They
threatened to carry capt. Brigg3 to the Ha
vanna, he being from an jSnglilh port ; but
after extorting a little money from him, he
was permitted to proceed on.
They told capt. Briggs, on leaving him,
they were determined to pursue the other
brig, (then in fight) and fink her ; for the
captain, thfey said, was a dâd American
bâr.
Capt. â¢ Briggs was afterwards boarded off
the Havanna, by a Spanilh frigate, and waÂ»

e CAUTION.
r "\TTHF.RHAS a combination of men in this
h V V county have undertaken to enrich them- I
y selves.l y fabricating titles to sundry valuable trada '
il of land, the property of gentlemen living in New \
Yoik, Philadelphia, London tnd Paris, for which j
Â«. trails of knd large funis of moneyhave been paid ;
J to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers
s It is therefore just that public information (hotild
s be given, to the end, that the injured may feekre- 1
r dress while the ivcn have property, and are to be
1 found. Those who have been discovered are Tru
e m-1! Harrifon, Joleph Witcomb, said now to re
-- fide in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and 1
several othert who go under fiilitious names. It is
â - supposed that the lands offered fcr sale on those fa
iÂ» bricated titlti, are at lcaft worth fifty thousand
- doliars. Such as we have a&ual knowledge of are '
'f as follows : Lots No. II and ;a, Ot/ego patent,
thousand acres each, the atftuai property of William
Uellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
lame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chauciont, now of Paris, and fames Avtrill
and others, e*l tni* State. There is fonie grounds 1
I, to suppose that the lands of RichardgWclls and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
, | management.âThe Printers will do well to give
. j tbiÂ»a place in their papers, as well to caution the
, ; public against purchafir.g those lauds, as also to de r
8 ( prive those men in future from imposing on indivi
dual, which their educatiou and address have en
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
afhopkeeper of some nore in this eountry.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
of view the. wickcdncfs of those men, which when
the public have perused, will induce them to ex
cuse the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 18th, 1797.
I I bonus Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav- 1
a '"E been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
iruman Har/ilon, of theiame County, .to sign a
deed to them, for lot No. 58, Orfego patent, wluoh 1
- was the property of William T. Frar.klin now Mr.
diamonds and others ; and further the said Joseph '
and Truman did persuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made out 011 the icth day
of November, 1793, or set back two ycats so as !
_ to bring it to that time; and further the name of
Pardon Starks to that deed \\as a fiAitious nanus, (
1 there being no such ptrlon there. To this I make 1
Voluntary oath. THOMAS KELLY. ,

a carpenter, and is a very lively bri/k work-

the laid fellow of Mr. Dubney Minor, in whose
' name he has baen advertised in the Richmond A

| summer) he employed a conftderable length Â°
, of time, by fume person near Dumfries, from
. which oircumftance, I conjecture, he has taken rt '
another nothei n route. I forewarm all peribns
from giving him employment, of any kind 1
whatever, and maftersof veflels and others, from
earrying him Out of this state. The above re-
ward will be given if he is taken within forty oJ

or the trouble and expeuce the apprehender may
