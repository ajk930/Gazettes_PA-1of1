The Answer.
THE French republic have, at various times
during the present war, complained of certain prin
ciple! and decifiotw of the American government,
as being relations of its neutrality, or infaflions
of the treaty made with France in the year 1778.
These complaints were ptincip.'ly made in the
year 1793, ant ' explanations, which, till now, were
deemed fatisfaflory, were made by Mr. Jefferfon's
correspondence, in Aaguil of that year. They
are now not only renewed with great exaggeration,
but the French government have diretled, that it
(hould be done in the tone of reproach, injlead of the
language of friendjbip The apparent intention of
this menacing tone at this particular time, is, to in
Silence timid minds to vote agreeably to their wifties
in the election of President ar.d Vice-Picfident, and
probably with this view, the memorial was publish
ed inÂ«the newspapers. This is certainly a praQice
that mull not f>e permitted. If one foreign minister
is permitted to publish what he pleases to the peo
pie, in the name of his government, every other
foreign minister mud be endowed with the fame
right. What then will be our fltuation on the e
leÂ£lioÂ» of a President and Vice President, when the
government is insulted, the persons who administer
it traduced, and tbeele&ors menaced by public ad
drelTej from these intriguing agents ? Pnjand, that
was onae a refpeftable and powerful nation, but is
now a nation no longer, is a melancholy example
of the danger of foreign influence-in the cletflion of
3 chief magistrate. Eleven millions of people have
101 l their independence from that < iufe alone.
What would hive been the conduct of the Frcach
Directory, if the American Minister had publilwd an
elaborate, and inflammatory address to to the people of
France ajÂ»ainft the government, reprobating the con
duit of those in power, and extolling that of the party
opposed to them they would have done as the Par
liament of England did in 1717, when the Emperor's
resident presented an insolent memorial to the km;, and
publilhed it next day in the newspapers. "All parties
concurred in exprefling the highest indignation and re
fentme*t at the affront offered to the government by
the memorial deliveied hy Monsieur Palm, and more
particularly at this audacious manner of appealing
from the government to the people under the pretext
of applying for reparation and redress of supposed inju
ries/' In consequence of an address from both hosfes
Monsieur Palm was ordered to quit England immedi
ately. And is it not ntcefiary that we should adopt
some remedy adequate to this evil, to avoid these seri
ous confequenccs which may otherwifc be apprehended
from it ?
The condnfl of tlje American government to
preserve its neutrality, has been repeatedly juflified
by arguments drawn from thelawsof nations; and
in the application of its piinciplet, they have gone
as fir, in every instance, and in one particular in
stance, farther, in favour of France, than the (tiitt
rule of neutrality would juftify. It would, there
fore, aitfwer no valuable purpose, to (late the fame
principles, and deduce the fame confequencfi, in or
der to juftify ouifelveson the fame ground that we
have already done 1 but as the reproaches of tjie
French republic are founded on an idea, that our
donflrufh'on and application of the law of nations,
is erroueous, partial and inimical; it maybe worth
while to examine, whether we cannot juftify our
selves by the example of the French nation itfelf.
I presume a better rule of jutlificatiori againfl any
c ' lar g e t cannot be required, than the conduct of
those who have made it,, in like cases-
I propose, therefore, to compare the deeifions of
the American government, in the several poiats
wherein they have been complained of in Mr. A
det's memorial, with the laws of France oa the
fame points.
It is sflertedf that the American government has
violated the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, by
arreting French privateers and their prizes ; and
that it has exercised Jhoclting perfections towards
them.
It will be founi, on an accurate enquiry, that all
the prizes brought in under French commissions,
that have been reflored, have been found to be in
one or the other of the following delcriptions :
1. Those captured within a marine league of the
fhorcs of the United States.
2. Where the capturing vtffcl was owned, and
also principally manned, by American citizens.
3. Where the rtpturing vefiel was armed in our
ports.
As to the jurifdidlion exercised by the United
States over the sea contiguous to its shores, all na
tions claim and exercise such a juris liSion, and all
writers admit this claim to be well founded ; and
they have differed in opinion only as to the Â«iftance
to which it may extend. Let us fee whether Irapce
has claimed a greater or lefÂ» extent of dominion
over the sea; than the United States. Valin, the
king's advocate at Rochelle, in his new commenta
ry o* the maiine laws of France, publifhcd firft in
1761, and a<;ain by approbation in 1776,* after
mentioning the opinions of many different writers
on public law on this fubjeft, fays, " As far as the
distance of two leagues, the sea is the dominion of
the fÂ«vercign,of the neighbouring coafl ; and that,
whether thcte be foundings there or not. It
" is proper to observe this method, in favour of
Rates whose coasts ate fe high, that there are no
foundings close to the fttore; but this does not pre
vent the exteufion of the dominion of the sea, jas
wc/lin rejpeft. to jurifdiflion as thejifheric's to a greater
diltatice, by particular treaties, or the rule herein
before mentioned, which extends dominion as far
as there are foundings, or as far as the reach of a
cannon shotâwhich is the rule at present univcrfally
acknowledged." The effect of this dominion, the
fame author fays, " according to the principles of
Puffendorff, which ate incontellible, is, that every
sovereign has a right to proteA foreign commerce,
in his dominions, as well as to fecpre them from in
sult, by preventing others from approaching nearer
than Â»o a certain distance." In extending our do
minion over the sea to one league, we have not ex
tended it fofar, as the example of France, and the
other powers of Europe, would have juftifiedâ
They therefore can have no right to complain as
our conducl in this refpeÂ£k.
* Cook 3. title 1.
The feeond defciipiion of cases, which hai in
. duced the American government to rellore prizes
claimed by the French, iÂ», where our citizens have
â  made a capture under a French commiflion.
The thiru article of the ordinances of the ma
rine of France, which the commissions now given to
French privateeers require to be observed, [Valin,
z vol. 235.] Â« as follows :
" We prohibit all our fubj'fts from taking com
miG>jns from foreign kings, princes, or dates, to
arm irefiels fjr war, and to cruize at lea under their
colours, unlcfs by our permifllon, on pain of being
treated as pirates.'! The commentator fays, these
general and indefinite prohibitions have no excep
tion. Tliey extend to commissions taken from
friends or aHies, as well as neutrals, and those that
are equivocal: and they were confrdered as ne~cf
faiy consequences of the laws of neutrality.
" If, fays Valin, the commiflion of the foreign
Prince be to cruize agsinft hit enemies <Si\o are our
alliet, or those with whom we intend It pre feme neu
trality, it would afford jutt ground of complaint 011
their pari, and might lead to a rupture." The rale
extends ns well to fubjefts domiciliated as net domi
ciliated in the kingdom, and foreign countries ;
" for Frenchmen arc not the lefj Frenchmen, for
having gone to live in foreign countries." If Fiance
may rightfully prohibit her citizens from accepting
foreign commiflions to make prize of the property
of her friends, why should the United States be
reproached for exereifing a similar rjrht \ A necrf
fary consequence of this wife and jutt prohibition is,
that all prizes taken contrary to it should be resto
red with damages to the party injured.
The third description of prizes restored is where
they have been fitted, and armed in the ports of
the United States.
I find no direst, positive provision by the ma ine
laws of France, prohibiting this ; but the whole
tenor r.{ those laws supposed that vessels of war,
are atmed in the ports of the sovereign who give
the cÃmmifiion. French privateers molt not only
fit out in a French port, but are bound to bring all
prizes made by them into Tome particular port, or
ports expressed in their commifiions, Valin. 2 vol.
,276. And it is certain that the king ef France,
previous to his alliance with the United States, d#-
livered up some American prizes, to the Englilh,
because the capturing vessel had been armed in a
French port.
Mr. Adet's memorial charges that the English
have been permitted to arm their veflels, and bring
their prizes into our ports.
As to this charge, the faÂ£t is simply denied. In
the cafcs mentioned, the veflels laid to have taken
in guns for their defence, were gone, before he
made his reprefen;ation : yet he complained, and
the government did nothing. I ask what could
they have done ? Mr. Adet will answer, they might
have declared war, against Great- Britain ; and it
is certain, this was the only remedy that remained,
in such a cafe : but neither our interest, nor our
duty would have permitted us to have adopted it.
Our interest did not permit us to gWe up our neu
trality, and engage in a foreign war ; the ovent of
which would have produced many and certain evils,
and could not by any poflibility have produced any
good ; âand it was contary to every principle by
which a just nation would desire to aft, to have
made war on a whole people, because one or two of
them had clandestinely taken arms on board for
their defence, in one of oar ports, without the
knowledge of their government, or of ours.
The memorial complains that we have infringed
the 17th article of the treaty of 1778, by retrain
ing the prohibition therein contained only to the
(hips of war, and privateers of their enemies, who
should pome into our ports, with their prizes.
The literal sense of the 17th article, is, that no
armed (hip who shall have made prizes from the
French people, shall receive an asylum in our ports.
The 22d article fays that no privateer, fitted under
a commiflion of the enemy of either, shall have a
sylum in the ports of the other.âNeither of these
articles fay any thing of prizes. The literal appli
catioÂ»of them therefore would exclude the captur
ing velTelt, but give admifiion to their prizes ;
which could never have been the intention of the
parties. The law of nations, exptefsly adopted by
France, relative to the right of asylum, may ilhif
trate these articles of the treaty. Old. Louis XIV.
Art. XIV. declares, " that no prizes made by
captains under a foreign commiflion, (hall remain in
our poits, longer than twenty-four hours, unless
detained by bad weather, or unless the prize shall
have been made from our enemies." But this arti
cle, fays Valin, is only applicable to prizes carried
into a neutral port, " and not at all to armed ves
sels, whether neutials or allies, who have taken re.
tuge there, without prince, either to escape the p\ir
fuit of enemies, or for any other cause.' They
may, in this cafe remain as long as they pl.-afe."
By the law of neutrality, simply, French j;iizes
could only have remained twenty-fosr hours in-uur
ports, but by the treaty they have obtained the
privilege of remainfhg as long as they please This 1
privilege iuu not ouly been allowed them in its ful
led extent, T>ut we had geue a ltc|Â» further, and as
a favor permitted them to fell their prizes, which
neither the treaty nor the law of nations required :
and \yhiÂ«h was of more i'mportancc than all the reft
put together. This favor, as favors generally are,
is now claimed as a right", anÃ the withholding it is
coolidered as an injury Let us fee what the'or
dinances of the French marine have said on this
point. Ord. Louis XIV. Tit. prises. Art. XV.
" If in the prizes brought iato our ports by vessels
| armed tinder a foreign commifiiÂ«n, there be any
merchandizes belonging to our ftihjet'ti, or allies,
those belonging to oqr fubjetls (hall OS restored, and
the rtjl shall not he put into bouse, or be pur
chafed by any perjon under any pretext -what/oever
And all this, feys Valin, is founded on the law
Â®f neutrality." By the Utrecht, Louis
XIV. and his grandson, the king sf Spain, agreed
mutually, to pcÂ»mit the prizes mad? by one.to be
brought in, ami fold in (he ports of the other. But
this the fame author fays, wasonly a particular ar
rangement, so much ths. Ids to be prnpofedjfor a
general rule, as the two nations iiad gii-en up thÂ£"
duties on prize goods fold ui % their dominions ;
which however did not laftlonj- en account of the
abuses to which it gave rife. Abufei fimiiar, I
p-emmc, to these to which the pevmiffion
gave rife in ttjis country.
The next ground of complaint is the Britilh
treaty and Its consequences. This treaty is said
to deprive France of all the advantages Itipulated
in t preceding :reaty ; and this is done by an aban
donment ef the modem, law of nations.
If we may credit the declaration of the king of
-France, there were no exciufive advantages (tipu
lated for France, in that treaty. Hl3 ambi(TÂ»<!or
| delivered a paper to the British court, dated the
! 13th of March 1778, whetein, after announcing
j the treaty between France and the United States,
lie fays, " His rmjelly declares ait the fame time,
thajthc contra&ing parties have paid great atten
tion noI to flipulate any exelufive advantages in favor
of the French natien â¢â¢ anil that the United States
have reftrved the liberty of treating with every other
nation whatever, upon the fame footing of t quality
and reciprocity."
The injury supposed to have resulted from an a
bandonment ofthe modern public law, assumes
two propositions, neither of which is true : ilf.
That neutral (hips make neutral property: ad.i
That materials for building (hips, ?rc riot among
the articles as considered contraband of war. By
the marine laws of France, fieg. Dec. 1744. 4rt..
I J, it is directed that " If tljere are found on board
of neutral velfels, of whatever nation they may be,
merchandizes or effects, bplianging to the enemies
of his majesty, they (hall Wgood prize, even tho'
they are not of the growth or manufacture of the
enemy's country; but the veflcls (hall be relcafed."
Previous to this j-egulation, and contrary to the
law of nations, as Valin acknowledges, if "either
the (hip or the cargo, or any #,irt of it, was ene
my's property, the whole wjp confifcated, by the
laws of France. And at this day, neutral pro
perty on "ooacd of enemy's rti'/ps are, by the fame
laws, liable to confafcation.
As toftontrahand of war, timber is enumerated
among the articles that are so, by Vattel, lib. 111,
chap. VII. but Valin is much more particular, 2
vol. 264. "In the treaty of commerce conclud.
Ed with tlje kirig of Denmark, the 23d of Augnft,.
1742, pitch rand tar were declined contraband 1
as also rosin, fail cloth, hemp, cordage, mafls and *
timber, for the building of flips- There would have
-Been, therefore, no reason to complain of the con
duct of the EngliGi, if they had not violated par
ticular treaties ; for of right (de droit) these t/.ingr
are contraband at present, and have been so Jince tin
beginning cf this century, which was not the cafe
formerly."
By thÂ« modern law of nations, e.xprefsly adopted
by France, enemies property on boarÂ«i neutral (hips
is good priae ; and by the fame law, the number
of contraband articles has been increased so as to
include thÂ» materials for (hip building. All the
fituaiions were probably forefeen, in which the
treaty might operÃte favorably or unfavorably for
France, at the time it was made. It might have
been ftipulatcd that materials for (hip building
(hould be deemed contraband, inflead of declaring
they (hould not ; or, that the United States (hould
not enter into any treaty in which they (hould be
made so. Neither of these being the cafe, there
is no ground of compla.'nt, except that the confe
rence is inconvenient, at present, to France, and
the belligerent power* allied to her. If timber and
naval stores are contraband by the law (if nations,
to "declare them to be so by a treaty, cannot be
coufidered as a privilege granted to one nation, or
an injury to any other.

CONGRESS of tÂ«I UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES*
Wcdnefclay, December 14.
Continuation of the delate on the addrtfs in aufwer
to the President's fpeeeh.
Mr. Harper said it was in order to move for a
divifiotl of this quellioo. The whole of that part
of the answer which moved to be struck
out, in order to introduce an amendment iu its
place, was personal to the President : the preceij.,
ing clause, which the gentleman from' Virginia
(Mr. Giles) included in his motion had refpeft to
the fituatien of the country, and contained several
objects of general concern, and therefore altoge
ther different from the other. Many gentlemen
might wifti to retain one arid to ftrikt out the other.
He (hould wi(h thefenfeof the committee to be
taken on striking out the firft paragraph, " Where
we advert, ' &c. He prefttmed this paragraph
would not be (Iruck out. It related to the fitua
â¢ ion of the country in general; to the grateful
sense we tfntertain of its liappy (late; and ofthe
influence our conititution has had in producing this
piofperous situation. And he would alk whether
this had not been the cafe ? There might be differ
ent opinions. Some perfuns might think that the
trifling c>Â«rangeracnts which had taken place a
nionglt our merchants, might lessen the profperoÂ«|
scene ; others might think that such circumftaneej
would occur in the molt flourifhiog (late of a ooun.
try. But was there any man who did not believe
the United States enjoyed happiness and prospe
rity ? That commerce ana agriculture did not flou
ri(h; that the laws did not reign, aud that the
country held out a pleasing and delightful prof
peft ? He would ask, whether any pc.fon would
deny that our government had brought about this
fituatioaof things ? Would any man fay, that if
that goveinmeat had nth been eflablilhcd, or feme
thing like it, this happiness v.ould have been ca.
joyed t He believed not. Mr. Harper then took
a view of the miserable situation of this coustry
before the establishment of the present government,
and made a contrast between the ijvo si liations.
If, then, said he, these advantages have been real
ly enjeved, where is the impolicy of faying so ?
What implication is there in this again (k the mea-*
furesof gentlemen, which, If they had been afteij
upon, might have pro.luced (though he was far
from Believing they would have done so) more hap.
py eftefis? Was jt calling upon them to contra.
Jift '.hi-i'fortner opinions ? No. They fee the hap.
pineft txid, and whence did it arise but front go-v-rjyaeat ? He believed the gentlemen would join
1 toi in faying they concurred in these sentiments ;
and if so, where was the propriety of refufing to
agree to this clause ? He hoped they would re-con
sider the matter, and that by dividing the question,
the clause moved te be struck out might be retain
ed.
Mr. Nicholas said the question could not be di
vided ; if it could, a member could never vote a
greeably to his wijh. For his own part, he had
lather the paragraph in question should be retained,
nnd have liked the motion better had it not included
sit. '
Mr. Giles said gentlemen might refufe to strike
cut the whole, and then move to strike out a part,
and so attain their otyft. Bur, said he, aJmitting
the paragraph to be founded on truth, was it a
thing they had any thing to do with as legislators ?
Was it proper to remind the people of Europe
that they are not so happy as we ? Huppofe, added
he, any individual was to go into the house of his
neighbor, and fay to him, " am very rich and
}-?ti are poor 5 I am very happy, but you are very
referable j" would fncli a conduct be well receiv
' ed i He believed not: and he was unwilling to do
that in a national capacity, which he disapproved
in an individual one.
Mr. Sitgreaves said, he felt himfelf perfectly in
different as to any division of the question, because
bis mind wat prepared to give an unqualified vote
to every sentiment contained in the answer report
ed. He did not believe it to be either unnatural
or unbecoming in us to derive happinefa from a con
trad of our own fltuation with that of other na
tions who were less favored. He believed it was
the only way in which,<ve could justly appreciate
the value of our fltuation. He believed everything
appeared greater or less, worthless or valuable by
comparison, and that our happiness and prosperity
would not appear evident, except eontrnlltd with
nations less so. He perfeflly agreed with the gen
tleman from Virginia (Mr Giles) that what was
condemnable in private life, would he equally so in
public, and he should think it wrong'for a man to
exult over his neighbor's poverty or misfortunes in
the way he had mentioned ; but though he should
fiot ebufe to oÂ£fend his neighbor, he saw no im
propriety if he, in the bosom of his family, patm
ed his faults and follies, in order to watn those uli
der his care against, the like, and that they might
be fufliciently grateful for their superior advan
tages. He thought there- would be nothing in
such a condu& either unnatural or unbecoming,
and therefore did not wish to fee the paragraph
struck out.
He did not in any degree doubt the wisdom and
firmnefs of the â¢dminiftration of the government :
in the language of the answer, he entertained " a
grateluleonviftion, that the wife, firm and patriotic
adminiÃration of the Prcfident, had been signally
conducive to the fuecefs of the present form of gov
eramect." This, he said, was not only his senti
mentâit was the sentiment of America.âSuch a
sentiment was the anly reward which could be giv
en to labours like those of the PJCuient : he tir#t
they ouglit not to'be withheld by that house, when
every public body, from one end of the continent
to tire other, were poflring thrui forth. He saw
so reason for being io veiy cautious of cwmplimeat,
which would in effect convey reproach inllead of
praise. If these sentiments were universally felt,
there could be no impropriety in their expressing
them : but if that House, indeed, believed that the
sdminillration of the Prefidtnt had neither been
wife, firm nor patiotic, then they would concur with
the motion for striking out. It had been insinuat
ed, that the present situation of this countty, with
refpeft to its foreign relations, was owinj; to the
want s>f firmnefs arid wisdom in the adminiftiation-
His opinion was direfily the contrary, and he be
lieved that it was the opinion of America. This
opinion was fully exprefTed by that Hottfe or a re
cent occasion in the last fcflioTi, and he did not be
lieve it had seen any cause for changing its opinion
It was no reason for qualifying the expreflion rela
tive to the prosperity of the country, because pri
vate credit had been in some degiee deranged, as
that derangement could not be attributed to any
*&. of the government. He was sorry that ftich
circumllances should have been mentioned, to tar.
nifh the bright appearance of the country. These
circumftaiices were *but like a speck upon the fun
Why were they not told of the fires which had hap.
pened at New-York and Savannah, as well as of the
derangements of oar merchants ? Such trivial mat
ters were not to be mentioned in a national view
If the gentleman from Virgiria (Mr. Gilss) did i
rot regret the refignatioa of the Prcfident, he did :
he beiieved America did, and he believed this re
gret was extremely natural andipreperâHe did not
thjok it undignified. That gentleman had said the j
gemrunent would go on without him, and that I
there wete many others capable of filling the Prefi- 1
dential chair. This might be so ; but did it sol- |
low, that they should not regret the loss of a valua
ble public servant ) Should we not regret him, said
by, OB account of the univcrfal confidence placed
in him ? Confidence in the officers of government
was valuable, he said, untkr every form, but'pir
ticalarly in a republican government : it was the
chief principle from which it derived its energy.â
Coold 1 his be denied ? If not, certainly regret was
natural, because thi* confidence would not be so
great in his fncceffor, tho' he might be pofTcfTed of
equal talents and virtues.
Mr. Sitgreaves said, ht should not agree to the
notion of the gentleman from S. Carolina, (Mr.
Harper) because it was fub&ittiting other words in
place of those nfed, for no good reason whatever.
Those wctds would not change or improve the sen
timent or the phraseology, and there was therefore
Bo ulP.ity in adopting them. Upon the whole, he
believed the answer reported, to be free from the 1
chargeof adulation. He believed there was not a
sentiment iÂ« it, which was not jnftified by faÂ£lâ
It wat expreflive of national regret at the departure
of our chief magistrate from office, and of national
gratitude for his services ; sentiments, which be be
lieved would not be agreeable to the American peo
ple to withhold from him.

Tliurfday, December ry.
The ordir of the day being called fur on the 4n

out the seven last paragraphs, for the purpose of

Mr. Fenno,
Confrdering Theatrical exhibitions, when conduced
with an earncft desire to please those, who support the
Theatre, by frequent attendance, as the only rational
entertainment the Citizens, in Philadelphia, can pofli
bly partake of in public.âAfter the laborions hours of
business, the theatre presents itfelf, to smooth the vari
ed scenes of life, to fee Nature pourtrayedor " catch
the manners living as they rife" either in the exh bra
cing smiles of Comedy, or the impreflive scenes of the
Tragic muli, these form " a confummution devoutly
to be wished," by every admirer of the Drama.
I well remember that for two seasons pafl, the per
formances have been much approved of, ttie perform-,
ers received that indulgence and almoli unbounded en
couragement their refpeflive merits entitled them to s
and, at the clofeof earh season, th?' Managers thanked
the public, for their "very generous and liberal sup
port." How then can those very Managers, now
ternc forth, â¢rid assert, the very contrary to b* the
fail : it fcfas then true, or if not, tlieir acknowledge
ments mu.t be considered only, a* fatyricil eulogium*
on a parfimoniouo public, whom they ieem inclined to
force ihto any msafure they may plcafe to adopt.
Mj WignÂ«ll,has gratifird the Phialdelphians, in
bringing Mrs. Merry ti> America, such exquilite per
formances as hers, must convince, even the molt preju
diced, that the ltage can, and ought tu pourtray na
ture in i!| the beauties of exprefi(<on and ailion. In
these Mrs. Merry tnfwers our nioft sanguine expec
tations. Were there such helpa to her at her abilities
deserve, and demand, the New Theatre would fully
compenlate the Managers ( even at the advanced
price ofadmiilion) for their labors. Excepting this
paragon, this excellent thea'rical Star, the present
company is much inferior in numbers and abilities to
any former leaibn : hew then, can the public expect
to have that entertainment generally they have been
used to. \[f we may judge from a comparative fettle
of the abilities of t'lofe Performers who have left the
Theatre ( on .what account the public are no otherwise
concerned than in thÂ«4ofs) and .those newly engaged,
it plainly appears, the public are not benefited- I
have* arranged the merits, upon- a ratio, making fif
teen cqÂ«al to the htgheft perfeflion, upon a general line
Â»f aifting, of tltofe absent, and of those engaged to
supply their stations, leaving the generality of the
company to their own merits, fcveral of whom are
really refpedtable

From this it appears that the former Companies
were much fnperier in number and abilities, to the
prelent arrangement. I have omitted feversl perform

The above system of Merits, are more from public,

of the Managers, and Subfcribcrs, whether the advan

HENRY IV.
THAT " huge hill of flefh," the fcnfible, wit
ty, Ray, humorous, cowardly, gluttonous, lying,
thieving FalitafF, not been, " any time ihefe
two-and-twenty years,"* exhibited in a more mif
terly and inip.ctlive style, than by War es, on
Weiuefiley evening.
Indeed this piece of acting was given with to
petfatt comprehcnlian of al! the minutiz of the
cliara&er, that criticism or comment were rain :
From the opening of the play to the ciofe, it was
supported with such naivete, animation, and confif.
tencyV *Â»Â» to authorize the opinion, that no perfor
mance in America ever afforded higher fatisfaQion,
or pnffefled better claims to pre-eminent met it.
Shakefpcaie, in thecouifeof his dramas, furnilhes
the critical observer with tbe original models of most
of the prominent. chaiaAers in modern plays. Dr.
Johnson ebfrrvfs, thai his " Pistol" is the model
of i.ll the bullies on the Engllfh stage, Dr. Young's'
Revenge is wholly built on the tragedy of Othello,
but it ie unneceflary to rite instances : the remark
must ftvikr every one ; and all that is left to regret,
is, that this fyffem has not been mote generally
putftied. Falftaff, unrivalled Falftaff, still (lands
untouched by the pen of any modern imitator.
And here Sbakrfpeare mtrft forever (hine without a
rival. His overheating excellent* in this finilhed
part, must inevitably swallow, ai in a vortex, all
who attempt to interfere with him. Indeed Shake
speare htmfelf is thought to have fallen off some
what in the continuation of hit Fat Knight, in the
Merry Wires of Windsor. As he is said to have
written this play in order to continue the cbara&er,
by command of Queen Elizabeth, perhaps his ge
nius may have been cramped or laid under reftraiiit
by the loyal command.
If any parts of Mr. Warren's performance were
particularly deserving of commendation, the whole
of his firft dialogue with the prince ; the soliloquy
on hoaor ; tbi merit i> the delivery of which was
such as to render Ihouts of applause iriefiftible â }â  â
his account of his soldiers ; âand that part of the
fecund aft where he upbraids the prince with deser
ting him, " a plague of all cowards," might be
mentioned as inllancei.
Mr. Cooper has great merit in Hotspur; hilac-'
tion is good ; tho' too redundant. If he erred, it
was in not being " hot" enoughâin general, this
leading trait in the chara&er did not miss his atten
tionâat times however he was remiss. The solilo
quy on the contents of the letter, and the scene
with his wife, were admiiabie.
It may not be improper to notice here some re
marks ot a writer, who criticises on Mr. Cooper,
with little " candor" or consideration. HiÂ» acti
on, fays this writer, was " mechanical." Is not all
aflion mechanical ! After dellttuting Cooper of all
claim to meiit, he concludes with an enumeration,
including all the more important poigtaof thf cha
racter, wherein he acknowledges him to have been
" peculiarly fortunate."
Mr. Moreton, when afllng " Hal" was in his
element, and did ample jnftice to the part ; ht
spoiled all in the Prince, by hi* rant. , In this pÂ» r
Within thiÂ« period have died two performers, of
diftinguilhed excellence in the character of Falftaffâ
Garrick and Henderfon. Htd they llv'd to " die here
after," there night have been oppsrtunity of inftitu
trng a comparison :At " 'tis better as it is:" and a
" younki-r" must rely for his knowledge of them, on
the " abflra<si and brief chronicles of the times."
ricular, however, lie hM much amended. It mult
all be ffiakcn off, before he can become a peifeÂ£t

NEW-YORK, December ie.
I \ SERIOUS ALARM.
Renewed attempt* to ftt fire to different parti
ef the city have been discovered On Tuesday
night a (hed in the rear of Messrs. Lindfey and
Knox's ivork fliop, in Liberty-fired, was observed
to be caught from coals ef fire concealed in an oiled
cloth, similarly secured with those lately ;depofited
in Mr. Smith's and Depcyfter'e cellars in PearU
street. The hotife of Mr. Lewis Ogden, in Pearl
ftrect, has been twice set on the
malicious intention it indubitable, and he has fens
his black man, fufpe&ed, to prison : Another at
tempt, we learn, wa* made on Tuesday night in
Eeckman-ftreet i a bed was set on fire under a child,
and his criei alarmed his family ; yesterday morning
the back-doot of Mr. R. Leroy's house in Green
wich-street, adjoining Mr. Lindfey'*, was observed
to have been affe&ed from the fame means ; the
fire having burned through the lower part of tiic
door before it expired.
Sufficient evidence ja thai obtained of the evil
intentions of a dclperate gang which iafeft* the
city ; and the vigilance of the citixen* Ihoulc be
excited proportionably to the mifchief which may
arise, if they are not early discovered or checked in
their attempt*. An additional night-watch of con
fidential person*, to be employed by the inhabitant*
of the different ward* ; âor an association of them
selves for the fame purpufc, have been thought of
as some means of procuring additional security, and
in some puts of the city have already been adopt
ed. We conceive that a reward fllould also be of
fered for the discovery of villains; and a sub
scription to defray the expence thereof (which
should be liberal) we have no doubt would be ra
pidly made up by the inhabitant*.
In addition to the above, we hear that attempta
have been mad e to set fire to' the large and elegant
range of store* belonging to Mr. Dclafield, scar
the exchange.
Attempt* were likewise made to set fire to thÂ«
(hip Mohawk, Capt. Moore.
AtÂ»o meeting of a number of the inhabitant* of the
firlt and second ward* of thi* city, at Mr. Rat
toonc't tavern, on Wednesday evening the 14th
December, 1796, it wa* nnanimoufly agreedâ
Th iT it appear* attempt* have been made by evil
disposed person* (unknown to ui) to set fire to the
citjSiu diver* place* i it is therfcorc recommended
that night-watch, compofcd of citizen* from each
ward, be eftablilhed, to serve in rotation, until a
more regular fyltem can be eftablifhcd ( and that
a guard of twenty men from thi* meeting be ap
pointed to patrole the firlt and part of the second
