Th? real ome of the perion knosfttfcitft'us I
under the name of Thebciu, Is Defporoclles, j
who was a Marechal de Camp before the re
volution, and a member I believe %>f the j ?
council of war. He had extenGve connex
ions with Lemaitre. It was he who drew
up the rules of the institutions and the truli- I can
tary. regulations. It is very probable that 1
lie was authorized tofupercede us provision- I
ally, for he is too prudent to remain in a .
situ ition of fuc.h great aÂ«l perilons embar- 1
rafTment. He lived in a country house near I
the Bourg Egalite, andvery rarely came a sea
town. He fatcl he was very clofe.y conncft- I
ed Â»ilh M. M. de Segur, aud assures us I
that they and their party would fccond us. I

feigned nime, and the person by whom it is I
a (Turned mult not have been connefted with I
11s, but probably with Lemaitre, whose cor- j
respondent ift London, Duttcil, was likewise I
my correspondent. _ I
â¢< Duval is the name that I afluroed in I
England, being accustomed to take a new I
name every journey.
" We do not yet know the names of the I
members of the lsgiflativt; body who belong J
to" our party. Lemerer and Merfem were I
the only intermediate agents, but the reft are
the members of the club of Clichi, or at 1
least the greatest part of which it is com- I
posed. The person who procured us the I
report of CarnOt relative to the descent up
on Ireland, must be clerk in the d:pot of
places and charts, called perhaps the Bu
reau des Hedographes or Typographes. I
I had not leifnre either to know him or the
person to whotn he communicated the re- Â°
p-jfl.' I believe that it was not the chief of
that Bureau, but that the piece was earned
off during a rscefTary absence of his Secre- *
tary in the month of Frimaire. t
" England paid liere a person of the name q
â¢of Hardemherg. The lattet hacf direst Com- n
munication with Saladin.
Â«' England likewise pays a petfon of the
fiame of VincWt. The minifte* of police
must know who hr is, at least he has often t
given us pieces of information which he pre- Â£
tepdfd to have received direftly from, that f
minister, at entertainments at which be was {
present. I have always been of opinion
that this man, for I an* told he is 10, t
has heen the dupe of our minister. _ (
A Â»orrefpondence, not entirely foreign to
our objeft, is. that of M. D'Antraigues with (
M. Sourdat, the father. The channel by ,
which it is conveyed is as follows : ;
" Sourdat writes either to an Abbe An
dre, who takes the name of Lemaitre, or an
M. < ! e Vaidene, well knowrt in the affair of
Lemaitre. These two gentlemen reside at
Laufinne, or Vivais ; by them the letters
are transmitted to an Abbe de la RounÂ«, at (
Bellinzons,. under cover, I believe of the
poll-maftc r of that place, and he transmits
them to Venice, where M. D'Antraigues
resides.
" From Venice the details go to M. de
and into Spain, for Spain is dill
anxious to know what the royalists are do
ing. Sourdat writes thus : direst to Bel
linzons, sometimes to Marco Philiberti, or
even other names. There is another direst
correfpotidence with Venice. The letters
are addreffod to Marco Philiberti, banker in
Bavaria. The.correspondence from the in
terior is of no importance whatever, every
thing of importance must be sent by Eng
land. Any thing more is t)ie mere accusa
tion of receiving letters. (An exaft eopy>)

the parifli of Eaftwood, confifling of the

tion, not only for providing substitutes for
those yonng men vvho, upon being chofca
by ballot to aft as militia men, may decline el
serving, but also to give a bounty to those c

Jacobin Editor of the English Morning t

fa id:
" Among the causes which have brought
about the day of the 18th Fru&idor, there
is one which has not bten fufficiently exam
ined. It is the inveteracy with which the
conspirators attacked the operation? of the
executive, In this class is the motion of
Paftoret on our conneftions with America.
" It is notorious, that the English carry
on three fourths of their trade by means of
American vessels; and as the dress, the man
ners the language and the habits of the two
nations are perfe&ly alike, it is evident,
that it was difficult to, dillinguifh. There
fore the directory adted justly and conform
ably to principles and to faÂ£l, when they a
dopted the resolution which orders the cap
ture of American veflels not conformable to
the articles of the treaty of 1778.
" I move that the council declare, that
there is no room to deliberate on the propo
rtion made by Paftoret in the fitting of the
2d Meflidor, and that they repeal the decree

meiice from the exchange of the ratifications '
* of the present treaty.

On Friday lad, at the fittings before

jry charged at twenty per cent, under the a
I express directions of the court. This de

e- Ihe advocates for the profcriptionÃ in
ie France contend that they are juftiftabie on
fs the principle of ntfeffity -.the necefSty of
n. securing liberty l>y establishing the republic,
e- and preventing the restoration of monarchy,
f. Let us examine this queftioti.
Ie j Either a majority of the French nation are
ie J desirous of a monarchy, or they are not. If
:e they are, on the republican principle that a
:e | " majority must govern," they have a right
i- to reft ore monarchy. If a majority are not
i- ' n favor of monarchy, there can be no nn.f
---g ftty for illegal and arbitrary meafines to sup
- press the advocates of monarchy ; becau'fe
e .he cxifling laws, if supported by a majority
e of the nation and the army too, are compe- â¢
tent to the purpose.
Again. Either BartStelemy, Pichegra,
and Co. believe the mats of the nation to be
in faror of monarchy, or they do not. If
j they do, they have a-right and it is thtirdu- i
r j ty to destroy the ufurpatioa of a fadicn and i
e 1 give the nation the form of government they
â - vvi(h. _lf they do not, they are traitors, and
t i all their party. The la(t fuppefition will
f | make rafjfal* of those who have supported
e j unblemifted charadters, performed most ef- '
. j fential.ferv.'ces for their country, and enjoyed :
, j public confidence for a long feres of years i
I i In I iort,it will prove the chr.ra&er of the
i j tlon io base, that it cannot be believed. If
| those men are traitors, yhere is the man
: j left in the nation that can be trusted ?
i j The most probable supposition iÂ», that
r the profcribtd party are the friends of piace
i and cjlablifhsdgovernment, and their enemies
) are determined to pursue the war ; they
t therefore found it necelfary to their bloody
purposes, to remove the friends of peace, who
r interposed obstacles to their views. It is a
fafl aflerted with probable authority, that
â  the DireiSory did not and would not fur
: nifh their ministers at Lisle, with definitive
, powers to make peaeeâbut when the Bri
ti(h and French negociators had agreed upon
the preliminaries, the Diredtory declined to
ratify them, or evaded. The probability is,
that this " triumph of liberty" in France,
will cost Europe half a million of lives.
(New-York Paper.)
During the despotism of Robefpitrre, a
curious incident happened at Venieuil : A
cobler of that place thought proper to put
three hogs under arrest, and to put them in
to the court-yard to eat the grass, and poi
son the prisoners with their filth. One of
these animals by some means was wounded
in the foot. The revolutionary committee
was informed of the fait; they met 'et the
priion, and a proces verbal was composed ; in
which it was dselared that the prisoners had
wounded the hog with a coimter-rcolution
ary intention. Diligent enquiry was made
through the house to difcoverthe conspira
tors ; but after fetrrching for .some time
without success, they mounted the Tribu
nal, and a Jury was funlmoned to give their
opinion of the offence. The jury, in their
verdift declared, that from the evidence be- ,
fpre them, it appeared that the hog had t
wounded himfelf with some broken glass 1
that lay in the court yardâand so the affair '
ended. The hogs were removed to give j
place to horses belonging to another member ,
of the committee ; and it was not till after, J
the 9th Thermidor, that the prisoners got 1
rid of these horses, or were themfelns set
at liberty.
