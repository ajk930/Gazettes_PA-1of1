Fellow. Chiz.ru, f S
IT fias been remarked that Mr. Adam,', book qân'
' 11 truf tb " preface of ,h c fi rtt vo . , Q ),
lume if dated irt January *787, hut it is a Ja& tha'
thethii'd voluifie was published after he was jpaflef
' fed of the federal conftiturion, whffch is annexed to
tv the constitution ; and that it contains, as wc have
fhewt), some of the passages which are nv>ft op
pofÂ«d to that instrument in principle. The (ftf
courfcs vpon Dav'tla too, are the mod forcible cor
roborations of this oppofiticn, and upon theftrong
presumption, thac they are the work jÂ»f Mr. A
dims they amount to an aS'i-ot unfriendl'tneft to the
tffential and cardinal principle of all our constitu
tions, both of the dates and of the onion. They
tend at this time to invite tli* intetpafuion of the
foreign monarchies in our affairs, however different
were certainly the views, with which they were
written.
It has been *lfo observed that Mr. Adams's
book was written before his two elections, and yet
; that the people had confided in him as vice-presi
dent. It is however true that the third volume,
being publifhc-d in London in 1788) could not be ftjr fa!e
-j in the America* Book-stores before the measures were
taken for the firft eledlio*. But what is much more imÂ»
n( j portaat and is absolutely true, the books were not read*
r much less Studied ia America, for books intended to
display great historical events and relating to the prin
ciples of government are Â»Â»t to be perused like a sum*
mer'staleâan amusing fible for an August day. By
the writer of t-hel'e papers the fecund and third Volumes
, had never been seen, except so far as their ontfides ia
the library of fonÂ»e other person.Â« And tho' the firft
volume had been a dlually pur-chafed, from frntiments
of refpedt to Mr. Adams's character and flat ran, it is a
truth, that other vacations and other books had occa
sioned it never to be either Studied or perused. Its con
tents and principles ware Hot know* 'till within a year
or two last past, when other circumstances of the nature
of the book, rendered Mr. Adams's work anohje<st of
or attentioa io many. Phocion fays, he has Seen much of
America and its inhabitants, and thai he has never
heard a wifli for any other form of government than a
Republic. The specimens he has given of re-state
ments even of the Written opinions and delites of oth
ers cannot inspire the Electors with confidence in his ac
curacy, in regard to what may have been orally deliv
ered before him. He too, Rke Mr. Adaias, may con
sider a limited monarchy as properly a republic,.and
he may deem a wife for a constitution like that Â«f G.
Britain, as only a desire of having another " form" of
â a republic, which Mr. Adams unequivocally afll-rts the
it, conkitutksn of England in truth to be. It rs our on
if. ihaken opinion, that the establishment of the Bank of
the United States was very much to -be-defiredâthat
neither this nor any ether civilized nation can avoid
the use of the excise mode of revenue, sooner or later
âthat the funding of public debts which cannot he
paid off when due, is as much a matter of fimphy'B/Wct,
of prudence and of natural conrle, aa the eivmg of a
common bond and securing it by mortgage for a j riva;Â«
debtâthat the chcck given to Mr. Genet by the Lxe-
S, eutire was perfefllv justifiable and necessary, and in
rt, fh'rt that many ails for which this government fas*
been blaiqed were fabjefls of merited approbatioc.
BÂ»t with these Sentiments it is a folenwi truth that we
â have fekferious anxieties at the txijlence and gra<ujtb
of the anti-constitutional do<3rine of hereditary power
',ur bn-ve nilually irrcmrd. We have fceen ex
r- ? !icit in regard to thisfubjeft on account of the decla
ration of Pbocxm, that he has heard no wifbes for anv
> but "publican governmentâWe knciv it to exist, and
we wiih it were only i* common minds, and in perfo*r
!e r '^^ c infiuenct. It is the true cause of the present
refpc<Â£tfui addreft to tkc Understandings, and patriotifra
Of the E'eftors. r
It is particularly nrceffary to remark, that there
have bee* Jiveml partial and general editions of Mr.
Adams's work. Ths firft voiume was published ifl
Philadelphia by Hall and Sellers, and the whole 3
volumes were printed in London. Other editionÂ®
have been printed, it,is believed in the Eafleri) Slates,
The size of the paper, types and paging have dif
ie f,red more or fcfs. The Preface in the Philadelv
,n phia Duodecimo occupies foventetn pages, but in
the (London edition it covers twenty-fix pages.â
â  t Sometimes it appears, that the preface is meant to
be referred to by writers in the Gaseues, when how
â ever they express themselves so, that thereader sup.'
poses it is the main body of the work. No volume
Â« numbered on the back, as the firft, beciufe, when
Â£ the hrit volume was published in Europe and in A
raerrca, it is manifeft that the author delivered it
*? the world as an entire work, without any intima
tion of pubhfhing a second and third volume. The
main body of the work, in this firft valume,
tamed in a little more than 389 pages in the Phi.
ladelphia copy, and occupies 392 pages in the Lon
don edition. These remarks upon the different edi
jj tuns wA pacing: and upon the preface and the main
wort are recommended to particular attention, be
cause they will obviate some diffatisfaftion which
. has been excited by the idea of designed raifquo
' tat 10ns. Iwo examples will be given. Time doeÂ»
not adsait of stating more. A writer from Hen
rico, in Virginia, animadverts with feeling, Hpon
some opponent of Mr. Adams, for quoting a pas.
, [ 3g '* ai fro " 1 j hc Bth PÂ»ge of his work, and fays,
he has read that page, and can find no fueh sen
tence in it, as wai given by the writer he is oppof.
ing. Now it is found, on examination, that thÂ«
passage referred to is substantially, in the feventl,
, page of Hall and Seller,'s Philadelphia edition, and
in the ninth page of the London edition, It so
not 1* the eighth page of either of those editions, so
that the quoter must have had another copy. But
further, it is in and not in the mainlodv
of the work. The passage is materila, and is fair
jy given to the world as Mr. Adam, wrote it w
. T 2 en I ,leman mentioned " monarchy" i B the
slofeof the preceding paragraph, and then gave the
oilowtng words, except the word monarchy, which
..nowputinto a parenthesis, and not in Italics, for
the lake of ft net accuracy.ââ

So, again, in the 2id page of the London fire

"tzlraft of a letter from St John's, A e'lvfoundland j 1
dated Sept. 21. 'â 
" Since for\trardmg our letter ef the 17th ult. we <
4'ive had no opportunity.ol writing to you,-being fincev <
the id instant in a flat* of blockade. Rear Admiral '
having efeaped the irigilaixx of Admiral Mann <
and got out of Cadiz, made his appearance about three '
leagues to the Southward o us, ok the night ofithe ift <
inlt. and'paraded in view of our harbour on the id, with '
one 80 gun. (hip, 6of 74, one of 40, and a corvette. 1
Ha ftiod on to the north about three leagues, and lay Â«
, to >t that diftanee, eonttantly repeating fignais and let- Â«
â¢ting off (ky-rockets. We pnrehended that in the 1
jnoining they meant to mate a defcentupon us in that t
diredlion ; vhieh however, they din not, but on the f
3d stood on again to the Couth in a-direcl line of battle, 1
â till they approached near L ape Spear/ when they bore
down in an irregular line direct for the Narrows. At
rthistime we imagined iheir intention \ras to force into
the harbour; Meanwhile all the batteries were extreme- r
ly well manned, and the forges at york heating balls.
Martial law, was also proclaimed, and all-the inhabit
ants, without diftindlion, were under arms, and at their
refpe<3ive posts, determined to make the mod vigorous J
defence. Two frigate, a (loop of war, and the Rom- 11
ney vjf 50 gun;, were Rationed at the opening of the
with springs on their cables. In this fitua- f
tion our arrangements stood, expelling every moment j;
the firing to commence. When the enemy arrived (
â¢within gun shot of the batteries, and in full view of our t
force,'having reconnoitred our strength andpofition,
the admiral thought proper to sheer off, and lland to a
the southward, and his whole fleet following his exam- I
yle. r l hat night they lay to in Petty Harbour Bay, jo
â¢where we were alio jpprehenfive of their intention to n
land some troops ; bat not thinking that meaftire advise- a
able, they fleered to the southward, and came tolnchor
in the Bay of Bull's. That devoted settlement they
have reduced to allies. By this deftruiflion the Haufe .
of Gugier and Tage hare loft feme thousands. On the 11
7th the enemy weighed anchor, and proceeded to the t
Touth east, in view of the different harbours ; and ftiort
ly after got out of fight. The 40 gun frigate appear- t
ed on the .9th, off Trepaffey, into which place Ihe chÂ»- Q
ied fame bankers, after which Die stood on to the weft
â¢ward.. On the 14th and 15th, the French fleet again
appeared in Placentia Bay, fterring N. W. by VV. 3
for Cape Chapeau Rouge, and this is thy last direit t
account we have of them Their manoeuvres have ap- a
peared unaccountable, and we think indicate a want of t
harmony among them. They are supposed to have
gone to intercept the outward bound Quebec fleet, 1
which are under the convoy of the Pearl frigate.â '
They are known to be in want Of bread, and confe- n
quently must soon repair to some port in the States;â

Seen by me, Captain Commandant,
ALLEMAND.
Yesterday arrived here from St. John's, Newfound
land, the (hip John and Jane, Capt. Branftptj. This
left England with the Britannia store-ship, which
an ived here some time since She is laden with govern
ment prcvifioni. Having put into Newfoundland on
the 26th August, and the French fleet appearing ofl the
iftof September, Ihe.has been detained by the embar
go which was laid on all (hipping in that part. She left
St. John's en Thursday last, the 20th ir.ftant, under
&onvÂ»y of his Majtfty's (hip Spencer, Captain Evans.
The account Capt. Brandon gives of the French fleet,
agrees with the intelligence contained in the preceding
letter. The (hips which were detached by Admiral
TUchery to tlÂ»e Labradore coast on the 9th of Septem
ber, were the Cenfeur, Duqucfiic, and Fripon. By
capt, Fvans, in the brig Madona, whs had made his
eicape from Labradore, and arrived at St. John's three,
days before the John and Jane failed, intelligence was
received, that the French ihips had entered Temple-bay
and laid the whÂ«le settlement in ruins. Among the
(hipping destroyed, there was a fine merchant ihip,
called the Regulator, mounting ao guns. Oaptain E
varii left the Lebratiore coast the 10th inft. at which
time those (hips were Rill there. The chief part of the
fleet was in at St. Pierre's on the 34th ult. on which
day two fail of the line went out on a cruile. On the
-tteh, the Admiral gave to capt. Long, who command
ed a ship which was destroyed at the Bay of Bulls, and
who, with his wife had been made prisoners, a fchoon
cr ivtrich he had captured, and permitted him to take
with him 60 other prifcntrs, and go wh*re he pleased,
and the fame eveniag the remainder of the fleet left St. <
Pierre's, and it was supposed they were all to meet at
'o:ne other place of rendezvous- The prifcaers whÂ»
have been landed from the fleet, report thatabout 14,00
Hoops were said to be on board the different (hips.
Those which they saw were a (habby looking pack.

Buflntfs in the House of Ctmmons this Day. ,
The House to resolve itfelf into a Committee to
h consider of a Supply.-' i
Late yesterday evening we teseived by express, I
the Patis gazettes to the 7th inll. inclusive, which -
is an in (lance of extraordinary dispatch '
In the variety of gazettes whiclt have reached us '
from the 3d to the 7th inltant, thete U not one of- f
fecial letter from the Executive Diredlery refpefling j
the armies of the Rhine and Moselle, and of the a
Sambre and Meufe, which we may fairly consider 0
as a most positive proof that the affair* of the 1
Ft'ench republic continue to be marked by a series
of disasters. This opinion is llrengthencd by tl|e
non-official advicet infertfl in these papers, whicS j,
admit that the French are every where retreating. 0
iTfre news from Paris, of the 3d states, that the 0
Atiflrians were preparing to attack the republicans b
'in their position behind the Sieg, and inthÂ»ir en- ''
trenrhed camp before Dufleldorff. P
A letter from Bruxellet of the Ift inft. ftatet, that j
the left wing of the army of the Sambre and Meufe 0
occupied the lines ef the Sieg, which cover Duffel- n
dorff ; that the left wing was in the Hundiiuck ; *
and the centre between Cologne and Coblentz ; but â '
that it was feared these petitions were not very fafe, 8
and that the Auhduke would attack the French on
the left banks of the Rhine. a
By letter of the 3d, from the fame place, we I
learn, that the French army under general Boiir
nonviilc, was again preparing to recrofs the Rhine, g
but his head-quarters were ltill at Cologne. â  The t .
Archdake has a formidable encampment near the t
Sieg, and also a camp of observation near Neuwied, v
to keep the French in check in that quarter. On
the 27th and Â«Bth of September, it appears there y
was fighting on the right banks of the
Rhine, opposite Cologne, but the result ie not fta- f
ted. V
The Auftrians are still blockading Kehl, with a
view of intercepting all communication between the
left banks of the Rhine and Moreau's army.
From the army of the Rhine and Moselle there '
is no official intelligence, except Morean's general '
orders, dated Lutmarftiaufen, the 20th of Septem- '
ber, in which he endeavours to toufe the drooping '
spirits of his army. The place from which these 1
orders are dated being situated in Suabia, at a small j
distance from the frontiers of Bavaria, it would ap
pear thm he is forming his retreat to the Upper !
Rhine in a manner which requite*, more firmnefs
than in general belongs to-the national of '
the French, to be executed with success rear . '
being conflaritly hariaffed by generals Latour and ]
Hotze, and his front menaced by field-marfkal Pe- j
trafch. Private accounts refpedting this army state,
that the Auftrians entered Donawcrth on tha igth '
ult. and they describe Moreau's situation as becom- â¢
ing daily more critical.
We cannot but consider it an happy omen for '
the state of affairs in Italy, that gen. Buonaparte '
observes a profound filenceon hit operations apsinft â 
" the (battered remains of marftial Wurmfcr's ar- '
my, (hut up in Mantua 1" as he called the field-mar- '
(hal's corps in his last letters to the diredlory. The \
Paris papers do not contain the least infotmation
concerning the republican army in Italy.
From the above extracts it will be seen, how ex- \
tremely difficult it is to obtain a clear knowledge of
the a&ual situation as affairs on the Rhine, until
the Hamburgh mailt arrive. All that we can learn '
is, that the French are every where obliged to re- '
treat. A report is mentioned'in I'Eclair of the 6th )
111 ft. that Bournonville had obtained some advanta- '
ges over the Auftrians, but as nothing more is men
tioned in the paper of the 7tf>, they are not likely !
to have been of any importance. ' 1
There is anather official note from the dire&ory \
in most of the gaeettes of the sth5 th isftant, refpedting
the passport demanded by our ministry. We are '
glad to observe, that its tone is changed, and that 1
the note is couched in more decent language than '
the Ult of its publications. It declares, w That if '
the Englilh miniltry yields to the wishes of the En J
glilh nation, whose interests and happiness are con- '
sided to its care, peace will no longer meet with '
delays nor inlerruptions.

j We hear from BrufTels, by accounts dated the ift of

that Prince Charles who has left the country adiacent

Should the Pope per (ift in his refufal, it is very

WETZLAR, September 19. th
The greatest anxiety ptevailed here about the
iffuc of the adion near Limburg, on the 16th, on
our learning that the French had received a rein
forcement of 15,000 men from the army of the th
North, and that after alevere engagement,/ley had to
succeeded in aft-ending an important height near he
Limberg. Our anxiety dill encreafed, on hearing by
that though the irsperialifts had, on the 16th, ta
ken from the French several important ports near
GiefTen, they were forced by them to recrofs the
Lahn, and that the Auftrians had loft 700 men in vei
that affair. At lengtlj, Itowfver, we learn, that Ve
'the archduke, after an extremely bloody conflid, fed
has proved vidorious over the French. By this the
vidory our neighbourhood is happily delivered from ans
all apprehenfians. Soon after the Auftrians had tad
defeated the French near Limburg, and advanced fini
beyond ehe Lahn, it was impossible for Jourdaa to ble
maintÂ«r&-hi:uiglÂ£ iny longer in
and the signal having been given, the centre of the not
French army, which was encamped in this vicinity, ed
as well as the head quarters, which were at Klofter in 1
Ahenberg, a mile diflant from out city, broke up Th
in the night of the 18th. Two horse batteries, the efc<
Austrian cavalry, and the battalion of Manfredini, or f
also broke tip immediately in pursuit of the French, 30
and yesterday morning we learned, that tfte French of
were greatly harraffed by the artillery or, their te- of 1

Another warm engagement happened also on the froc
16th, near Weilbourg; in which general Haddick witl
beat the French, took 600 prisoners, and 12 pieces "

lat Very few of the French, who,a few days since paf
