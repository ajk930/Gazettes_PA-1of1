On the prafofed ChrjUnn Convention.
13 â
Mr. Sangaroon. Mr. President, I humbly con
-3- ceivc that the business which is now before us, di
vides itfelf into three propositions. 1, Shall the
Christian Convention be held in Augusta, on the
fiift Tuefdsy in November next. 2. If it is not
then and there holde*, when .and where shall it be.
And 3. What measures (hall be adopted to effeit
3 the great objedt of Jlaylng the waters and prevent- 1
ing them from pafiing aver our streets, or carrying '
30 away our heufes, whether temples or other buildings. (
50 As to the fir (I proportion, the reafonaj&vt/ us its
rejeAion is so obvious, I (hall offer nothmgbn that
head ; but proceed to the second, whicfi is a quifli
on of great magnitude, viz. " ivhen and -where
shall this convention be held ?"âthe -when I confi- f
der to be the most important part sf the difcutlion,
for if that is rightly concluded upon, the, where
will be truly immaterialâthe ivhen then we (hail
con&ne otirfelves to for the present, and to give us a
a proper conception of this matter, it will be tie* '
ceffary to recur to the original injiitutes of this foci-
ety :âThere, Mr. President, it is iaid down as a <j
fundamental maxim in the Prolegomena thereof f;
, 7 " that as the length, breadth and conformation of t
4 no two noses in the world is exadly the fame, so a
0 neither can the ideas, opinions or conclusions of any b
two minds pcrfeiWy eorrefpondâfo, therefore, the e<
enjoyment of opinions unmolested, is a matter of â¢'
equal right with that of wearing a nose, and hence n
every oppugner of another's opitiioni is to be eon- ft
4 lidered a breaker of the intellectual peace,' and, as a <
4 it were, a puller of thd foal's nose." Now, Mr. fn
' President, as we can never hope for fach a change ei

rence, to the opinion of the members. " an
Kcf.ilved, I hat it is the opinion of the I.ont

Mr. Bottlemore then rose and said. ] do not tii

and as this process may con fume more time than m<
we are aware of, I move, that the words " Gene- lar

Mr. Segai o then got up and fpokc as follows. wi

rit Â«f the resolution. as to Mr. Bottlemore's amend- ma
ment ; there is a circumstance however which tio
when duly Â«|Â»ffji-rÂ«a t will perhaps induLe a father Im:
postponement of the matter in question, and that is, dif
that the day Contemplated in the amendment is the Th
very day on vAich the honorable Charles Fox is to W
come to a fityl settlement with the Jews j now, that mij
j two objefls may not interfere, and that many Jews Bu
who call themselves Christians may have no caufc to too
lay an advantage is taken of their situation, I pro- w h
p.ne that Mr. Bottlemore's amendment may give a| c
way to the following, viz. That the words " day ed 1
after the gene.al rcfurreaion" be struck out, and of
the words Â» First Tuesday after the day of ludz- dw,
mcnt" be inserted in lien thereof. veri
I he president having put the several questions in ' hur
order, the resolution was adopted with Mr*. %"a- J

Mr. Sangaroou then refumedâtiiking up the is ft
fubjeft as his third propofitisn. The molt obvious poci
expedient (proceeded he) which occurs to me, as fant
most effectual to preveru -the ovoflowingof the <wa- stun

of his nomination to that important station from
the President of the United States, as early a", the. jj
27th of July last, and that he has gone to Pliila- C(

As the latest accounts from Europe hold out the | {

this event taking place, that new regulations res- w
pefting commerce will be brought forward, and it j- (
may be neceiTary sot America to renew her trea- j
