MOST delightfully situated on the north bank of Rap
pahanock river, opposite thÂ£ town of Fredenckfburg, in

dred acres, as may best suit the purchaser. There is on
this estate, a large and well built brick house, containing
nine commodious room*, cxclufive ol a spacious hall or en
try, 21 feet f<juarc, two pair of stairs, fuiiable ar.d conven
ient pillages, and exeellcnt dry cellars. It? is placed on a
fine he-lthy eminence, commanding beautiful views in
every dire<ftiun over the tcwiu of i're igfickfburgh aÂ»d
Falmouth, and an extensive cultivated country The
grounds adjoiuing the houie are neatly laid out in pleas
ure und kitchcu gardens intsr-fperfed with a variety of
fcarcc trees, a choice collcOtior: of fiouvrs and Cowering
Ihrubs, aud enriched by various ferts of the following
fruits, viz apples, peats, walnuts, chefnuts, cherries,peach
es, plumbs, nedtarine*, apricots, grapes, figs, rafbtrries,
goofeberricr, strawberries, and currants; the while admi
rably varied by turtedCopes which have been formed by
great labour and expeuc*. Bordering upon thefc in.-
provemcÃts,are l'evcral lots, in a high llate of cultivation,
and well set with red clover and orchard gral's, from
which three heavy crops of hay are taken every year. Ad
jacent thereto are two large aud flourifhing orchards ; one
of well chosen peach treas, the other of apple and pear
trees, feleiiedfrom the beit nurseries in the state. Pro
perly detached from the mansion house are extensive
roomy officeÂ« of every denomination, viz a Kitchen and
Larder, house-keeper's room and Laundry, with a cellar
underneath for a variety of purpefes, a ftore-1 oufe and
smoke house ail of brick, a dairy and spring hoult of ftope.

barn and granary, a cow house, with fÂ«parate fulls for
thirty-fij; grown cattle; apartments for fattening veals,
mutton and lambs; extensive fbeds for sheep, and other
arrang- merits for stock of every defenption, with a large
and convenient receptabie for provender, from which they
can be furnifhed without being exposed to the inclemency
of the weather. An overl'cer's house, blacksmith's shop,
and quarters fufficient to accommodate in the best man
ner more than fifty labourer!.
The arable lands arc fÂ» adva&tageoufly divided asta af
ford an opportunity of malting a large quantity of Indian
torn annually, without bringing the field into similar cul
ture oltucr than once in four years; consequently the
lands may be improved by keeping up the inclufurcs during
the intermediate years, or may be beneficially fallowed for
wheat and other grain at the option of the proprietor.
Un the prcmifes there is also a merchant mill with one
pair of belt French burr itoues, and one pair of Cologne ;
furnifhed with modern machinery, and now leafed fÂ»r the
Unexpired term ol four years, at 1501 per annum, and all
; grain for the use of the farm, hopper free, which is near
ly tool. more, the mill and miller's house are built of
free stone, within a very small distance of navigation, near
to which are two or more valuable lifheries, and a well
accustomed ferry uver the Rappahannock to the town of
Frederickfburg. J he land contains inexhaustible quarries
ol free stone near to the river, is plentifully supplied with
remarkable fine water and poffefles a due proportion of
meadow, which by having the command of water may
be eotifiderably increased. The roads are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel and fsciable. Infacft, exclufiveof
an improveable and well condic-oncd farm, the value and
emolument inseparably counedlcd witn a iniv', fwries,
fiflicries and quarries eligibly situated ; the profits arising
irom an ice-house iflforior to none in the state, and a gar
den of four acres so abundantly stocked with vegetable*
of all forts as to be fully equal to the demand in market,
there might be detailed many other advantages, apper
taining to the fertility of these lands, which the fubferiber
conceives it unneceflary to mention, being fully convinced
that when examined, it will be found to be a complete,
pleasant and healthy rcfidence, poffefiing beauties and
conveniences fuffieieiit to attraA the attention of any per
foil dufirous of becoming a purchaser
The motive which induces the fubferiber to offer for
; sale an estate so Angularly beautiful and advarttagcous, is
; a desire to become an inhabitant of Alexandria, where he
can with mote iafe attend to his interests in the neigh
; bonrhood ofthatcity
The purchaser may be accommodated with a few flavcs
in families, either for plantation or donteftic use. A part
of the purchafc money will be required and the balance
made easy, the debt being properly secured.

To the Senate and House of Reprefrntativss of
the commonwealth of Pcnnfylvania, in General
AfTembly met.
The memorial of the president and managers of the
Schuylkill and Sufquehannah canal navigation,
and the Delaware and Schuylkill canalâ
[Concluded from yesterday's Gazette.]
Your meraorialifts, therefore, finding tteir pres
sures from the nature of the cafe, rather increased
than diminished since their last application to your
honorable body, beg leave' to renew their prayer.
First, That the legislature may intercft the slate
in a convenient number of (hares in the said canals,
at the par value (according to the example of sun
dry of the fifler dates) placing the commonwealth
on the fame footing as the original (lock-holdere, in
refpr& to future emolument and dividends.
Second, That a convenient futn be advanced on
the credit of the stock and tolls of the canals by
way of loan* from the (late, whereby the works
may be continued i* operation, and the proceeds
ef the lottery in fame degree anticipated, with a
profpeft of terminating the work and compleating
both canals within the time limited by law, or that
the aid of the leg'flature may be granted in any
other more effedlual and better way, which, in
their wisdom, they may devise.
But in contemplating the aid expected from the
legiflatuie, and confidcring that, in the arrange
ment of the (late finances for the proportionable be
nefit of both canals, the sum to be appropriated
may not be conveniently issued from the treasury in
toto, nor in one year ; your memorialists, on ma
ture deliberation, are of opinion, that the firft pro
ductive aid (hould be applied to the Delawjre and
Schuylkill canal, for the following reasons
1 ft, B'caufe the said canal, with a fufficient
number of workmen and adequate fundi, will be
soonest put in operation and compleated.
idly, Because the Schuylkill and Sufquehaunah
canal, before the other is compleated, cannot be
brought into full operation, for ttanfporting pro
duce to the great mart of the city ; but when the
other ii compleated, it will yield an immediate toll
of great value, by means of the produce and heavy
materials for building, with which it will supply
the city and its vicinity: and especially by the
rich supply of pure and wholesome water, 'which
it is intended to distribute to every houle in our
metropolis, as well for femily use, as for the great
purpose of preventing or subduing the ravages of
fire âthat dreadful foe to lite and. property, when
not under our command.
On this fubje&, your mrmorialifts beg leave to
enlarge, in two diftinift views.
First, With se(pe& to pure and wholesome wa
ter in great towns, and cities, a writer in a late
Boston paper, speaking of the great aqneduft now
coÃllrufting in that metropolis to supply the houses
and (hipping, juflly ob.ferves Â«Â« That aquedudi wa
" ter from livers and pure springs, saves half the
" expenct in soap and half the labour in washing
" linen : and the ease with which it is wa(hed
" may make another saving in the wear of the
" linen in 'washing nearly equal :o the above. But
" a more, interesting* confederation and important
â¢Â« benefit of pure water is it 6 tendency to prefervc
" health, as water enters into all our food and
â¢' drink. Our philosophers agree health de
" pends most eflentially in the purity of this ele
" ment. It is observed also that all water grows
" worse in cities by the constant accumulation of
" matter whiph- finks into the earth { so that all
" well-water iu old cities becomes extremely un
" wholesome and increases the bills of mortality ;
" and therefore to have water pure and plenty in'
" cities, by evÂ«ry way incrcafing th* means of
" eleanlinefs, as well as by rendering the system
" of nutrition wholtfome, must be of the highest
" consequence to prevent putrid End pejlilential
" fevers and other fatal difcafes." The fame writer
mentions also the additioual fccurity from fire,
which is ta be derived from plenty of water duly
distributed through great cities; and concludes
with a just pride, that â¢' Bojlon will be the firji
" large city in the United States, thus accommo
" dated."
Who is there among us, that can call to h's
remembrance, the number of valuable citizens,
swept from us by the pestilential fever of 1793â
when the heavens were as, iron bound over our
heads, without a drop ef rain for many weeks,
and when, under Providence, had our canal system
been in operation, the fever might have been pre
vented, or its rage soon fubdned ? Or who is there,
that reads the late accounts of the dreadful fires at
New-York, Baltimore, Savannah, andothet places,
with the failure of their well and pump water, or
its inadequacy to subdue the conflagrations > Who
il there, we fsy, that considers such dreadful cala
mities, and would set down to count the cost of
preventiÂ»g them if within our power; when the
loss of property, byj one finglc conflagration, may
sometimes exceed the whole cost of an artificial
supply of water? As to tfie loss of valuable citizens
by pejlilential diseases, all cost of prevention vanishes
on the comparison ; not to mention that when canals
and aqueduAs of this kind are on. e duly dfenftruaed
and finifhed for great cities, they continue for the
benefit of our children, and childrens children, to
the latest generations. In this view then, when
the legislature by a liberal aid, (hall have ellablDhed
a confidence in the work, and allured the public
mind that this canal will fpcedily be compleatcd,
your memorialifls cannot doubt but that the citi
zens of Philadelphia, so highly interefled in ifs
fuceefs, with their usual liberality and public spirit,
by subscribing for new (hares, or by a generous
loan, will supply every remaining deficiency in the
fuads. And die corapleating of one canal will, by
the example of its utility, insure the completion of
the other; and even add to the means, by convert
ing the surplus emolument (beyond what the law
allows to the ftockholdcrs) to the usÂ» of the other
canal, if uectffary, or to other fitnilar improve
ments.
All which is refpeftfully submitted.
Signed by order and on behalf of the
joint boards, N

On the 25th instant, in the morning, we dis

us and approached nearly within hail, before they
ohferved the Santa Margaretta to t>e a frigate.
They endeavoured to render the retreat of the one
or the other secure, by Handing on different tacks,
and I followed the largest, with little profpeft of
taking the other ; but Mr. Birchali, the firlt lieu
tenant, with a degree of zeal and intrepidity tiiat
does him the highclt honor, voluntarily offered to
attack her in a boat: At this time our (hot had
reduced her fail, so as to enable the boat te get
alongside, and 1 had the fatisfÂ»ftion to fee her
taken psffeffion of in a most and officer, like
manner. The (hip we followed (truck her colours,
after having received a few (hot, and proves to be

CAR! HAGENA, October 30.
Tie squadron under Langara has made a very
clumsy debut.,
The Ships Neptune and St. Jofcph had cut off
two vcffels of the English divilion, and might have
engaged them ; infttad of which, however they did
not tire a gun, altho' within half cannon shot; they
relumed to the squadron t* jrelate the number of
vuflcla had leen, vAlch (.very hV'y knew at
we'll as they did. This cowardice begetting a Sus
picion of tr 'ifon, al) the journals of the squadron
were infpcfted by the admiral.
Oathe 13th 0&. the Mahonnaife, one of the
fineft frigates iu Europe, failed out of lhiÂ» port to
carry coa(t pilots to the fleet. She was met at cape
Gate by an Engliflr frigate, who, after an engage
ment of two hours and a quarter took and carried
her into Gibraltar. On that day we dittinaiy
heard the cannonade, which laded from 9 o'clock
A. M. till half pad eleven ; and what is extraor
dinary, there were in the road 6 frigates and a 74.
gun ship, who did not give themselves the trouble
to leok what was the matter.

COLOGNE, November I.
Our letters from thg Upper Rhine state that the
lafl battle between the archduke and Moreau was
extremely bloody and decifivo. We are afftircd
that eight thoufaud were left on the field of battle,
and that the eroding of the Rhine by the French
wa% the event of this a<Sion.
That which took place oh the 27th ult. in the
Hundfruck was not consequential as to the lots of
men on the part of the impcrialilts ; but the (.rods
which the French reoovered on this occasion are of
extreme importance.

On the Upper Rhine the. imperial army,ndvs De

that the French at present only occupy Kehl, â¢ t>n

are ordered to quit Triede within tight days. ](t
is said that the Freneh have Attempted a storm upoa

ITALY, October 2J.
The fcqueltration put by the French, on the
hooks, money and goods of the different tradesmen
at LegUorn, was noticed some time ago* This
meafuie was preceded by an event which gave rrfe
to some disagreeable (cenes. The people repaired,
in a croud, to a miraculous crucifix placed in the
church of our lady. This alarmed the French
commander, the mare becaufc a falfe report hai
been fprcad that the populace were armed with
long knives, and that they meant to rife. In coiir
sequence of this report, on the 22d of September,
2SOO French surrounded the chvrch in which the
people bad aflembled. French put roles paraded
the dreets, forbidding any person appearing at the
windows, uncfer pain of being shot. The French
soon entered the church, atid fcized the redior, hiÂ»
curates, and the crucifix, all of whom were con
veyed to thi citadel. The grand duke's troops
had received orders from the French commandant
not to interfere in the business.
M. Vilette the grand duke's governor of Leg
horn, the 1 ufeaa general, Strafoldo, were arretted
the fame day. They are dill rn prison. Ever
since this unfortuuate affair, in which a score of
persons loft their lives, the guns of the citadel have
been pointed against the town, and JieTufcan gar
rifoÂ« have been confined in the barracks.
1 he grand duke has been greatly afiifted at thiÂ»
event ; nnd we are allured that he has cauffd the
itrongell reprefectations to be made as well tq the
c. ire Aery as to the French g *â  ralson the fubjeÂ£t.
PARIS, November 13.
On the z6th ultimo, two fail of the line, and
two Spanidi frigates, arrived at Toulon. The re
mainder Â®f *he Spanilh fleet is cruizing off the
coad of Toulon.
The Executive Din&ory has received difpatclres
from the General in Chief liuonaparte, they ure dated
trom the headqua-ters at Verona on the Bth Brumaire.
A letter from Toulon annovinces ; that the Spanifn
fleet iÂ» cruizing off that eoaft. It ennfifts of twenty-fix
fail of the line, of which eight are three ; three
of 80 guns ; and relt of 74 ; betides 53 frigates, a
corvette, and a brig.
Don Joseph Cordova commands the Erst divilion ;
Gonde Morales-de-les Prios commands the second;
and Don Juan Joachim the third.
, Accounts from the Upper RhiHe, as late asfhe3Â®th
of Ca. state, that since Gen. Moreau has completely
repaffed the Rhine Prince Charles has advanced to
wards Kehl, and dill further.Hls>) cad-quarters the 30th were at OfFendUrg, and
he had rent Tome heavy artillery from Manheim to
baiter fort Kehl. y
The rorps of Hotze who had advanced to Germer
(heim and the environs, is to fall back and occupy the
lines of Mundenhcim, Frefenheim, 2nd Oggerftieim.
It appears to be the intention of the Archduke to at
tack the remain ng positions of the French beyond the
Rhine, before he attempts to pass that famous barrier.
Thus Neuwied and Duffeldorf, Kehl, and the bridge
at Huningen, mult fix the place at which he will eftab
li(h his winter quarters.
It also appears to be his intention to keep at bay the
army of the Sambre and Maufe on the Lahn, during
the attack upon Kehl.
Numerous batteries are ennftrufling on the Lahn ;
those at Leydefdorff are provided with numerous ajrtil
lery. All the Auftnan magazines are there ; and Gen.
Kray has 20,000 men under his command who are en
camped from Vallendar to Erlich.
The Spaniffc squadron is raiftrefs of the Mediterrane

' BONN, November 2.
We learn from Weiffenthurn, under the, 3.lft ult.
that General Championet repaired the preceeding eve
ning to the island facing Neuwied, 4nd celebrated there
a fete on account of the viilory obtained by the French
troops in the Hundfruck.
LONDON, November if.
In yeftei day's paper we stated upon food autho
rity, tbat the troops stationed in the harbour of
Brest had been sent into thÂ« inteiior of the country;
and by a letter from Dover brought over in an A
merican vefiel, we learn that the troops which had
been collected at Dunkirk, and the other towns
on that line of the coast, have been ordered to march
to join the army of gen. Bournonville. From these
coirefponding movements, it seems evide'nt that,
if the Diredtory ever did entertain the frantic de
sign of an invasion of England, they have pru
dently abandoned the enterprise.

Extract of a letter from Mdnmouth County, New

"I have been considering how to keep infurreftion
iacev out of Congress, &c. and at the fame time accord
with the mild lpirit of our laws. Whoever has a knowl
edge of antient history knows that the bane of Repub

will do well to read lytachiavel's history of Florenceâ
He will there find a picture that may be of use to him.
But to my plan:âlf any couhty in any stale in the
union (hall oppose orobftrufl a law of Congress so that
in couid not be carried into effect and it became neces
sary to have recourfe'to other parts of the fatd state to
coerce, such county (bould for 10' years, be deprived of
the right to fend members to Congress, or to the fla'te
Legislature ; â-3nd if one or more counties were to join
in such opposition, ip that the state could not maintain
authority ovtr its membersâthen such state (hould be
deprived'of its right'for 10 years,âHad such a law
been in force a few years past, it seems probable we
ftiould not have been under the necessity of fending, at
a great expense, the militia of this state to steady our
tottering neighboursâand If every foreigner was to en

. Much has been said within a few yeatg for and

the experience we have had of the Tories during

in any (enfe, and the sooner their country is rid of
them the betterâBut to this freedom to expatri

there is or ought to be laws to punish all who injure j

American veiTels whatever, hound to or froai British
ports, ar engaged in any commerce contrary to the or
ders of the Executive DireiSory. In conference of
> wnich, about 65 fail of American veflels in the part of
f St. Domingo were condemned (vedlls and cargoes)
. and all Americans were detained in port, under pre-
I teneeofan embargo. Every American vessel which
. arrived bound to French ports, Wave had their cargoes
put in requisition : and if any oppofitioa was made as
to giving Bp their property, the captains lave been
lmprifoned, and their cargoes taken from then and de
posited in the government stores. The made of eon
-1 dem nation is unprecedented,âthe captured are nat
, permitted to pot in any claim for their property, ar
adduce any proof in their behalf whatever. They
have also refufed to furnilh copies of their condemna
tions.
It was supposed that ( upwards of 10Â® privatters were

the fubjeft of the demand made by the Executive
Directory, that hÂ« should produce the powers un

the part of the emperor.
We are afTnred 1 by high authority, that our go

for a separate peace. They have furnifhed lord
Malmefbuty with certain documents, which mani
feft the difpofltion of his imperial majesty.to n lift
ing and equitable peace, and which authorised the
overtures made in his behalf. Should, hawever, '
direct credentials from the emperor to lord Malmef

r The speedy armament of the Brett fquadrqn oc
t cupies ail hands. Several of the twenty-One (hipl
of the line, which make at present our whale naval
force in that quarter, have already their whole cam*
r plcment of mo. In the above number are com
prised five (hips lately arrived from Rochefort and
1 Orient. It appears, that that fleet is to have pro
visions for fix months, whith proves that they are
Heflined for fame ejCpcditiort in a remote quarter,
and not fur the improbable and ridiculous plan of
, nakinjf a descent upon England. It will be com
manded by admiral Villaret Joyeufe. We feel a
pleasure in pointing out to the public, the admiral
whom the dircdory honor to deservedly with their
confidenee.
Villaret JoyeuTe commanded last war the Ilrij
frigate, and distinguished himfclf in a fight with
an English frigate, in which be had the advantages
He made all the naval campaigns under admiral
Suffrein, who was highly fond as hifls. He is nat
only a good seaman, but alio a goad scholar, wha
can quote almoll every v.rfe of Horart or Virgil.
He wasalcftcd a deputy of India in the national
convention, but he refufed that honor.
â¢These encomiums will perhaps be considered ai
exaggerated* by those wha remember the defeat* of
the i zth and 13th Prairial, jd year, or the fata!
eruife as 1794 ; but those battle* were given t J
gainst the opinion <if Villaret, and at the peremp
tory lnftigation of an ignorant and prefumptuoua
Ptoconful. Villaret had feut prated after protcft Â«-
gainst that fatal expedition to which we owe the
ruin of our Marine.
,Letter* from Brett, of the 29th of oÂ£t. state,
that the expedition in that harbar had tanguifhe4
for a long while, till it waÂ« accelerated by the arri
val of gen. Hoche and a cemmifiiener. Fifteen
ships of the line are Shortly cxpe&ed to fail ; but
they want many articles, the crews are incomplete*
and foldiers_are to replace thefeamen, whose num
ber is hut small.
1 hat expedition is fÂ«;n with inquietude at Brest
all the sailors disapprove of it, especially Villaret
Joyeufe, the admiral, who dreads the fame difattert
which made us fuflain thelofsaf 6 erf of our fi
ned (hips of the line, during the famous winter
eruife of 1794, the season is too fat advanced, and.
the ships in the word date.

Lord Malmrtbury and j Englishmen were yef

This Lottery will afford an elegant fpecimsn of the pri

Two bcauuiul designs are already fele&ed for the entire

it ispropofed to et . rt two centre and four corner buildings,
as soon as poflible after this lottery, is.fold, and to convey
tÂ£em, when complete, to the fortunate adventurers, in
the manner dcfcribed in the fchemc fur the Hotel Lottery.
A nett dedu&ion of five per cent, will be made to defray

the whole bufmefs in a year from the ending of the draw
ing, and to take up the bonds given as security.
The real securities given for the payment of the Prises,
are held by the President and two Directors of the Bank
of Columbia, and are valued at more than half the a

The twenty four gentlemen who by appointment of

By accounts received from the diflerent parts of the

have been sent for sale, the public are aiiured that the

WHEREAS vei*y hrge and heavy debts are justly
due and owing from messrs. Blair M'Clenachan and j..
Patrick Metre, of the city of Philadelphia, merchants, a
trading under the firm of Blair M'Clenachan and P. p
Moore, and from Blair M'Clenachan in his separate
capacity ;to which, by the laws of the land, the
toint to wtill as separate property of the fa:d Gentle
men, is. and ought to be, liable. And whereas
it is clearly and Satisfactorily ascertained, that mr.
Blair M'Clenachan, of the said firm, has conveyed
away to mr. Job:i H. Hujlon, his foil-in law, to his
daughter, miss M'Clenachan, and to his son, George
M'Clenachan, Several large and valuable real estates, n
as well ai oonfiderable personal property, in the city *
andtounly of Philadelphia, in the county of Lancas
ter, in the county of New-Castle on Delaware, and
. elsewhere!, with a view, as it is apprehended, to de
feat the Oreditors in the recovery of their just debts.
This is, therefore, to forewarn all persons whamfo- 1
ever, aga'mft the purchase from the laid grantees, or J
| either of th?m, of any portion of the said real or per-

TO THE PUBLIC. :
THE caution introduced into the public prints,
warning all perfonfi against purchasing from the ]
â¢ grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the _
large, real and personal estates he conveyed away to |
ir his fon-iii law and to hi* children was the result of ,
d a deliberation had upen the fubjeft by a general and ;
I, numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
â¢ M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clena- j
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trull confidod in the fubferibers by
those creditors : a step which it would have been a
â breach of <4uty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very statement of iWe'faft therefore must dif
pcl the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or viÂ»diftive." it originated in a deiire to secure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fandioned by the
advice ot council as a measure necejfary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the adverufement ha* been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to hii own unjuftitiable conduA, not to the lub
