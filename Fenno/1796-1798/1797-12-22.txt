FROM A VIRGINIA PAVER.
M_ . C
Mejfrs. Printers,
The ditdoguelately publiflied in your Muse- ( j
um under the signature of " Student,"
was well received by the public so far as
my observation has extended ; encourag- ,
' ed by his success, I beg leave to trouble ]
you with another, which I over-heard the j |
other 'day between a Frenchman and a ,
Virginian: âBy publifhingwhich I doubt \ ,
not but it will render equal fatisfaftion to ]
your readers. And oblige yours, &c. ]
Philo-Stubent.
Frenchman. So. now my good friend
John Federal, we are now all citizens of the 1
wbrld j and T am come oyer to advise you
what you fliould do.
Virginia". Advice ! Monfew Francois ;
do yoii pretend to give advice ? And what
advice have you brought with you I
F. My advice is that you (hould not
think so highly of your American liberty,
or suppose it worth keeping ; buuhat you
fhpuld give it up and become as free and
as, happy as we are.
V. As happy ! if you cad your prelent
situation happiness, what mud you have been
used to Â» .
F. Oh begar, it was so very bad it could J
not be worse. . .
V. What !âDid you begin to dilltke
your black bread \
F. No :âBlaei bread is a one very good
thin"-: and we are now glad enough to get
it. but join us and I think you will
soon learn to like it. â¢ .
V. No that won't do : black bread would
foOti turn four Â« n an American (lomSch.
We are used to corn bread, good homany,
flrong leather jhces, and goodjhirts.
' F. Leather (hoes and good (hirts . Un,
my friend, that's luxury. Wooden Jboes are
very comfortable : and as to (hirts, they are
no mere necessary than breeches.
V If the French think so that may be
all very well for them : but if you are so
easily fatisfied, what could go wrong With
F. Perhaps you have heard of the Bajli'e )
and that the uoblefse could fans ceremonie,
have any one he chose sent to a dungeon
there for life. __
V Aye by Jove ; but if one was to try
these tricks here (hould havt:6or Habe*
Corpus and swingeing damages for felle un
prifonment : our juries would not be very
merciful to thofc kind of gentry.
F. Perhapi; you might : but the ba.o.e,
T ard 1 that was nothing ; we did not mind
that. It was a flea bite. Wc were twen
ty-scut millions of people : they could r.ot

f Frenchmen. cure
j V. Net mind-imprifonmen- in.a dungeon kno
l for life !if you did mind that, what the as :t
j devi 1 did you miiid ? I
F. Wc all minded what we all'fit ; and mtn
ican > nothing clfe. ers,
I V. And what did you nil fid then ;or tirrn
, what cotild be worse than thehnltile 1 our
J i(1 1 F. Many tilings in France, my dear Jyhn l'ec
â <l of ' Federal were a thousand timer, worse. We lies
frein | all felt our taxes ;we all felt the maimer in
:agt- which they wire i.r.pof.d ; and the manner cqu<
lefitie in which they were levied. waj
locÂ»- V. Why, to be ftire, taxes are very bad the
JÂ«- thingsbut lam afraid there is no doing dre
3J well without them.
anA F. It was not the taxes we minded but a r<
thq abuse of them. In the fitft place the zer
ruble nihility and the flcrgy*two very numerous ter
T-oO- and opulent bodies amongd us, paid nÂ» tax
-les at all.
V. Why, they could bed afford it ; the fer
form rich folks pay almolt all the taxes with u*. bo'
m#r ; F. But not so in France ; the rich were its
that entirely exempted. But we could have mc
n due borne that, if that had been all. The word pu;
â¢eadi- waS) the intendants of the provinces or
and thsir deputies had the whole dire&ion the
' c a ' u as to who (hould pay taxes, and who not. cd.
oubt- V. In America, however, it is very
mri'" 1 . different.
onful F. The intendant could exempt or charge ma
upon an y one as, he pleased. His relations, his wi
P'S e > friend, his deputies, their coufin3, and dc- un
I,ula , r pendents, were favored op discharged from tk<
*'vav taxe3 as pleased : and the. whole bur- iul
, nei'- den was to fall on the poor, the friendlefs, fat
, nor and thofc who were the lead able to bear it. an
ividu- V. And how long had that cursed work tu
or the gone on in your country.
or, in y. Some centuries. Bi
linage v. Some centuries ! It would not have hii
3 I,e laflsd in America, some hours. Why yc
ie ca'e zounds, man, if a big man was to try to a"
ed as throw his taj*es upon one it would not be bi
lie 7th enough td let him hear.ofit at the county
ces of court, I would make the whole continent di
ie car- w ; t j, ; t> - p;

Pelves! es ? Every poor family wastopayfor so much F
â¢urrali- fait every year, whether they used it or no ; A

This c Â°'* â ' I Shan't like the name of France a- c

ife the justice ? 11
k, wjs | p. No : for as our judges purchased their t
"!f rÂ° f I places, ftÂ» they carried on the market, and n

a good rv little for what his antagonid could fay ; 1
g, the he was sure of his cause let the law be what F
it would. u
public. y. Well now and tint's the difference e
mcr. hetwixt you and us. If a rich man and a i
Irs tvi. poor man have a taufe in our courts, and
Ã¼baird the law pretty equal between them, I'd lay [
three to one the poor mail carried it. J

and if game-laws ! you have no game laws here I a

F. Not (hoot on anothers ground unless '
Muse- | he pleases ! What will prevent '

:ourag- ttuth, if it had been only eoming on ones

Not content with fending in upon us those

V. What can that He ? wit
F. Equality, my friend cannot be pre- 'toi
served hut by cutting down all that rife a- set
hove othersâThose to whom France owed fee
its liberty, were great men, and had great
merit : but their exiitenee was not to be
put into competition with their country, %rm
or with our fyllem of equality. They hve
therefore all been either massacred or lanijh

V. I am very sorry for it. H<
F. It could not be helped âThere is no |
maintaining a complete system of equality
without it. Some of their fueceflors have

the fame fate; and the last set who have ag

fame manner nA: room f<Jr another crop : foi
and so we lliall all live free, and die in our a 1
turns. an
V. A very enviable situation indeed.â |
But what is all this to Americans whose gr
birth right is Liberty ?â'The abuses that
p you complain Â®f do not cxift in America ; co
, and our free constitution is juflly admired re,
; by>eveiy true hearted American. th
r F. A constitution ! I laugh at your con- ,n
t ftitutwn. Whit i willyou pretend to com- to
pare America,with France in that refpeÂ£t ? ce
s V. Read your own dreadful accounts of aÂ£
. the torrents of blood which have stained the th
i French revolution ; and"then turn to the d<
; American history and fee our federal gov- m
r ermrient formed without one drop of blood,
without interruption to the ordinary course *'J
i- of justice, and without violation eveu of the 1"
) form 3of civil harmony. 11
e F. But mr. Federal conftder the natural
rights of map.
V When we enter into society, we ex
i- change our natural rights for civil rights. t<
0 The firft are the rights of a savage to prey *
upon the weak and helpless ; the latter are 11
ir the rights of society, for our get
d neralhappinefs andmutual afiillanceand pro
t- teftion. '
1- F. But why not have both ?
t- V. Because they are incompatible. Tour t
; Equality leads to nothing but confufion, c
tt plunder and massacres : the result of which v
unless your wild notions of liberty are cur- c
:e ed, will be a relapse iato slavery, as the lef- 1
a fer evil.
,d F. Ah ! Sir dou't be seduced by your 1
iy present peace and prosperity ; why will you 1
persuade yourfelf that you arc free and hap- t
ie py, or trust to appearances, however favor- '
1 able. '
V. Why now to re&fou about it Monsieur
g- Francois ; would you seriously infill on my 1
ra taking physic because you have been tick ? j
or because you have the French disorder is it '
:fs necessary that / Ihould undergo a Saliva- 1
tion ? '
F. It might b# very good for you by way j
in of prevention. 1
C 9 V. And then perhaps my history might <
ve be the fame as the man's who was well ;
11. took physic to be better ; âand died.
ur F. Ah my good friend, be allured that '
,n- the French nation interests herfelf in your
ly following her in this as in other fafiiions, and

ure Hearing much of an extraordinary cir

ing tain, in this town, during the late viclent
the rains, my curiosity was invited to make.a
visit to that mountain, on the ealt-fide of
ing which a rupture has taken place.
The elevation of the mountain forms an
vig- angle of 45 deg. consequently it is very
: if steep in this place.
ory About forty rods above the foot of the
[gn- mountain, the eruption began. Here the
wd, foil, loot: stones and ruWbilh appeared to be
as about three feet deep, lying upon a fohd j
em. rock which composes the mountain. The
ran-' depth .of. foil eucrrafes as you descend the
cart mountain until it becomes ij feet deep at
it at the bottom, d The earth, loose stones and
such trees, begiW'tti the mountain about

rocks of an enormous size, the direction was
1 tn- immediately down the mountain, until the
lend heavy rubbufh formed a little mountain 01
itfelf at the bottom: the light rubbilh, such
as trees, small rocks, &c. took another di

This forming another obffrudron to the e-j

and three feet on each fide. From the
Circurnflance, you may form some faint i
dea of the amazing force,* which the erup-*
: tionhad here. , ,
From the cause of this phen
omenon, is ealily investigated. During the
violent rains, the mountain because full of
water, and nfit only the water which ran
down on, the top of the fol'id rock, but like
wise the whole body., with which the
â  mountain was impregnated, bursting thro'
the crannies and apertures of the solid rock,
a torrent was formed, which spread devia

was 12 feet higher than where the rubtiifh

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
\
WEDNSSDAY, DECEMBER 20.
Mr. Macon was persuaded thst it would
be of advantage to the revenue, as well as
agreeable to citizens int'ie habit of distilling,
if persons were allowed to take out liccnfes
for a single week. He therefore propofet
â¢ a resolution diredling the committeeof way!
and mean to report on the expeiiency o!
, such a measure, by bill or OtherwiCe. A
: greed.
The house again resolved itfelf into :
; committee of'the whole, on the bill for th<
[ relief of North and Vefey of Charleston, anc
the petition having been read, the amend
tnent propofeJ yederday by Mr. Cbit,
. to leave it to the colle&or of the Port to at
? certain the quantity of fugardeflroyed, wa
f agreed to 48 to 12 ; the committee rose
Â» I the house concurred, and the hill was 6r
I dered to be engrofied for a third reading to
. I morrow.
, I Mr. D. Foster reported a bill for the re
e I lief of the representatives 01 captain Georg
e Hurlbut, which was twice read and con
I mitted for to-morrow.
J I Mr. Harper moved a resolution to tt
Ifollowiug effeft :
" Resolved, that a committee be appoii
i. I ted to enquire whether any, and, if an]
y what amendments are necelfary to be ma<
e in the aft relative to invalid pensioners, ar
I to report by bill orotherwife."
Mr. H. said, it mult be recolledted th
I frequent application had been made to th
I house by persons who had been wounded
ir the war, for a pension, who would have bei
t) duly entitled to it, and to whom the hou
h wished to have granted it, had not tht
r . claims been barred by the law of 28th Fe
f- 179 J. with which the petitioners were ge
I erally unacquainted. Some of these caf
ir had appeared to be so hard, that in one
iu I two inttances the house had been indue
to difperife with the law. He tho't, ther
r . I fore, it was proper the law fliould be reco
j fidered.
tr Mr. J. Parker seconded the
,y knew of several instances where persons we
> justly entitled to pensions, who had ntv
it heard of the aft of 1795 until their claii
a- were rejefted, whillt others, jx-rhapi 1<
I deserving, were is pofleflion of peuGo
,y He hoped they fiould not longer deny t
I justice which was due to the veteran wot
ht I ded soldier. *
I Mr. Macon believed that as all fubje
I of this kind were constantly referred to t
at I committee of claims, they were of cou
ur I betterwequainted with the business thar
nd ny other committee would be likely to b
as j he therefore moved to have thii refoluti
as I referred to that committee.
I This motion was supported by Mess. C
do and Nicholas,andoppofed byMeff.S. Smi
vy I Parker. Harper, Brookes and Swanwj
!t! It was, however, finally carried, there
â¢ce I '"g 5 1 v otes in favor of it.
s; J Mr. Nicholas called for the order of
[ day on the bill suspending the fecondfeft
we of the aft regulating foreign coins ; wh
r ty motion being agreed to, the house went i
[he j a committee of the whole on the fubjei
:he when
ar - Mr. Sitgreaves wished to propose ar
or- mendment to the bill, so as to make it c
formable to the report of the Seleft C<
mittee ; btit, as he believed it would be
iu I ficult to incorporate such an amendment
Ito the bill, without re-committing it,
>ir- I (hould mov* for the committee to rife, v
un- a view of afterwards moving a re-commi
ent of the bill. He would uot recur to the
Â«.a guments used on a former occasion in f
of port of his motion. He wilhed to give
j Foreign coin in question a partial currei
an which should give it a natural current
er y wards the mint. A number ofcalculat
had been made on this fubjeft, when
the merly under difcufiion, drrovn from an
the report from the Mint, which were very
Ibe j applicable to the present state of that e;
<lid lifhment. By the report of 1796, it
rhe j peared that a greater proportion of S
the than of Gold Coin had been iffved; bu
> at j this report, the Gold coiu was nearly
ami j bled since that time. It appeared, W
i () ât the report of 1796, that the proportio
;1 of cbih< depotited, Ctthipared with IngAts
and other Bullion was vei* small ; whereas
rery the present report, it would appear
and three-fourths of the whole amount of th
was polits in Colii, had been made in coin,
the two-thirds of the silver. This report vÂ»
n of also (hew that the gentleman from Mar)
such (Mr. S. Smith) was not correft in hi
r di- mark, when he said, no bank in the U
with States would part with their foreign
rods for the purpose of re-coining, as not
op-e- three-fourths of the Gold uepofited had
riae. u coin, but it was almost exclusively
the back of the United States: 2 greatpro
portion of the silver coin deposited had also
come from the banks; and the direftorin
formed rhem that, in thebanks of New York *
and th;B city, there were thevalue of 300,000
dollars in crowns, ready to be sent into the
Mint. These ftt'ieme'nts furniflied great
reason for doutrting the jiifliiefs of the in
ferences drawn by gAitlemen in the former
debate, and gave additional weight to all
the arguments in support of the report'of the
feleft committee. It appeared by the re
port's', that there had been issued from the
Mint of the United States, coins to the va
lue of 774,000 dollars. He had never seen
any estimate of the whole amount of the cir
culating medium which vfrould be neceffajy
in this Country for all its commnrcial con
cerns, nor did he know upon what data fucli
an'ellimafe ought to be made: but when
they saw the amount of the coin issued, and
j reeoMefted the immeofe quantity of Spanish
1 dollars in circulation, as we.l IU bank paper
bottomed upon aftual specie in the coffers
of the Banks, there could be little doubt
that there was a fufficient quantity of circu
lating medium for alf the purposes of com
mercir, though the aft of 1793 were now to
ga fully into operation, without even the:
partial fnfpenfion recommended by the feleft .
committee. The only evil which would.re
sult, would be, the loss which might be At
tained by the holders of this species of coitrj
but even if the law were suspended for two v
years, as proposed, the fame evil would in a
1 great degree, then recur. Gentlemengreat
s ly miscalculated, he said, when they fu'p*
, posed, that, in the mean time, the foreign,
s coin would, by degrees be brought into the
] Mint. Indeed they fay, it cinnot be spar
s ed from distant parts of the country ; a*id if
f so, it cannot be expefted to come into the
. Mint, without a legitimate force to bring it
thtre. A partial fufpenlion would produce
a this effeftj and whilst this coin was received'
c ed by the colleftors, as usual, it could not
J diminish greatly in its value. Indeed, he
[. was of opinion that it would be bed to keep
, the law as it flood, and leave any regulation
which might be necefiary, to the Executive
lS of the United States, who had already or
dered it to be received in the way proposed
r _ by the feleft committee, and who-would be
j. the best judge of the regulation from time
to time necefiary.âWith refpeft to the fa
reign gold coin, as the law prohibiting that
r e as a tender, did not take place far fame
months, the holders of it might get it out
of their hands, before its value was dimin
ie' ifhed ; aud as to filvar, he believed the inju
ry was already done. If the aft of 1793*
u . were therefore, suspended, it would give
y ( the crowns a new value, and, at the end of
de two years, the fame objeftion would be again
rid urged, and the Mint, in the mean timewouSi
be without support. He thought it was
at proper, on this occasion, that those who,
at wished to fu pend the law, should come out
in with refpeft to the Mint. Hi thought it
en bed to go to the whole fubjeft now, arid let
ife the aft of 1793 stand, or fall with the Mint.
Â»; r He moved that the committee rife far the
b. purpose he had mentioned.
â¢n- Mr. S. Smith was not ranch lnrprifed at
r es what had fallen from the gentleman from
or Pennsylvania, as he was desirous if car
ed r y ln g bis point. It would be a -very
re - convenient thing, at this time, far the
)n - ' city of Philadelphia to get as much of the
money of the United States as
r l e pofiible into it. It would do away tha*
: re scarcity of money so heavily conftplained of.
f er But he did not think the gentleman had
m s fucceded in his atttnept to correft the ftate
ttfs ment formerly made by him. He did not
ns . fay that the banks of this city might not
the fend cain to the mint, but that no bank at
un- a distance ; for instance, at New-York or
Baltimore would do it, as they always flood
â¢fts in need of their coin far the supply of thtir
the customers. And he was warranted in this
irfe opinion by the report before them, w not a
la _ single bank out of Philadelphia had depafit
)e ; ed a {hilling in the mint. And what, he
ion alked, had the banks in Philadelphia done >
He lwd merely doubted whether they would
Joit be able to spare their coin to fend to the
ith, mint. This was a different thing from
ck. banks ia general. They had always from
be- ioa to 300,000 dollars of government de
pcJits, ready far the exigencies of govern
tbe ment ; and he thought it judicious in the
;ion Secretary of the Treasury always to have
iich such a sum of money at command ; but they
nto might surely spare a part of this money to
& â¢ be recoined. With refpeft to the silver,
when they found the French crowns called
a out of circulation, they deposited in
:on- the mint, because they might as well be in
om- the mint as to lie dead in their vaults. Not
dif. one of the other banks had deposited one
in- (hilling in gold ; but the banks of North
he America and Pennsylvania had feut in fame
vith silver ; because it was as well there as in
ittal their coffers. But what has been the con
e ar- sequence of this fluppage of foreign coin ?
sup- It has brought French crowns from all
: the parts of the Union. The gentleman had
ncy, said that the Executive had given orders
to- for French crowns to be received by our
ions colleftors at 1Â»Q cents ; but how, ho alked,
far- were they to be gut to Philadelphia ? Were
I old they to be transported at' the public ex
in- pence ? If they were, and he knew of no o
itab- ther way, ii would not amount to a trifling
ap- sum. But would it not be doing an eiien
iilver tial injury to the citizens to take away from
it by thera their cash, without Tending any other
don- in its place ? It certainly would. If it Were
' w by to be mailed in, new coin ftionld be pseviotu-
II of ly issued to take its place. If what he ad
and vanced bÂ° r e hard Â»p on the mint cf the Ã
by nited.States, he could not help itâhetho't
tli3t the mint founded, in felly. This was not
iÂ»de- i the opinion of the gentleman from Penn
and fylvaniait might be the interefl of his
roiild. slate to support the mint, but he did not
pland think it was the intereltof the IJflion. Mr.
is re- S. conceived another eonfequence, if the law
nifed refpefting gold coin was not suspended.
eoin Merchants were as defirows of exporting
only gold coin as silver, and there was as great a
been difficulty in procuring it when it was want-,
from ed ; but if its circulation were to be stop-
Iped instead of'..mliiijj, ii lite b>; . â¢
voy'.d pu:h it evtjry bjOiTy, and M
woultl.be modly exported. And hovv, he
aGtfd, were it to be got back ? Nobody had
said any tiling on this fubjeÂ£l but the gen
tleman from Msffachufetts (Mr. Stvvall),
He said that doubloons, or four pi Hole piec
es, were imported at n loss of |ths of a dol
lar, and that these woflld continue to be im
ported. He did not know but finall fifh
inj* vefFclt; might be in the habit of thus
dealing ; but merchants in any extensive bu
siness made remittances to London, where
doubloons .were at their full value, and drew
bills upon Londpn ; or sent doubloons to
the French Well-Indies, where they were
worth the full sixteen dollars, and got arti
cles in return which afforded a good profit.
They were in the habit of importing gold
from Lisbon, when the exchange was against
them, but there was a profit upon this gold
jof fix grains upon a half-joe. Thii was oik
-of the inducements ; but it could no longer
be an inducement, if they were to be nn
longer payable. Gold therefore would
be no longer imported. If the mint were
# tobefupported,the plan of making an appro
priation for the purchase of bullion was the
only one which was at all feafibls. He
ihou'.d of course be against the committee's
riling.
Mr. Sitgreaves wiflied to set the gentle
man lad up right as to matter of fa ft. He
had said no deposits had been made from a
distance ; but if he attended to the report
of the direftor, he would find, that he ex
pected about 300,000 dollarsfrotn the banks
cf this city and New-York, and he was in
formed that 250.000 of them were to come
frrim New-York, as soon as the mint was
ready to receive them, and a guard was
provided.
Mr. S. Smith said he supposed fjiefe were
crowns whoft circulation was (lopped.
Mr. Swanwick observed, that it some
times happened that legi/latures im
proper laws; when they did so, they gene
rally to correift themselves. What
was the fa& refpe&ing the lqw in cpieftinu :
A law had been'palled declaring that fr?3ch
crowns ftlould not be a lawful tender after a
certain period ; that period was pasTed ; but
the Secretary of the Treafnry, in contradic
tion to it, had dire&ed the officers of the
cuftotns to receive them as usual. Waa not
this an acknowledgement that the law was
improper and inconvenient? Jtwould.be
well, he said, to take a view of the iituati
on of our commerce, with refjedl to circu
lating medium. The main objeifl in the in
flitution of tha bank of the United States
was to give a general currency to its paper,
that it might take place of coin in a great
; but they had been told by the gen
tleman from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) that
though these notes were a lawful tender in all
payments to the United States, they were
not current in the interior of the country.
The chief circulating medium of the coon
try was, notwithstanding this, paper. Mer
chants, in paying their duties, generally
gave a check upon their banker; therefore,
though our revenue produced seven millions
a year, but a small part of that sum is paid
in calh. What, then, wan the use of fo
reign coin ? It was not wanted so much
for a circulating medium at home, as for ex
portation. Much iif it was sent to the East
Indies and to Great Britain ; and, though
Tome gentlemen h?d said a gold coin #f the
United States was so fsarce au article in the
interior of the country, that when it was
met with it was hoarded as a pocket piece,
be had been lately informed by a gentlemen
from London, that he had seen a large quan
tity of our eagles sn a goldsmith's (hop there
for the purpose of melting down, so rapid
ly, said he, does our eagles talc thc':rflight.
Foreign coin being therefore neccfiary to
pay the commercial balance due from us to
foreign countries, it would certainly be im
prudent to call ic in. Mr. S. was opposed
to the powfcr being yefled in the Executive
to regulate the business of making foreign
coin payable or not payable at his pleasure.
Ifthemint ellablifhment wereto be supported
it mud be done hefaid,out of the revenue receiv
ed. A fmallfum would do it. Butwhyforce
individuals to bring their crtiwns into the
mint ? Whqt advantage would there be in
ii ? Could any one fay this new money would
(lay at home ? they could not, and there
fore, where he could fee no advantage, he
was not for putting any class of people to
inconvenience. It were; - bÂ«(l, he believed,
-to let the bufinefss of foreign coin remain
without.restraint. _

Agreed.
Mr. Gallat'n presented a petition from Gaz
zam, Tjylor and Jones, of this city, praying for
the allowance of a debenture for poods which
they had loaded on board a vefiel for St. Tho
mas's, in December last, which, after it set fail,
was found to be leaky, and flopped at Reedy-
Island to repair ; hut the freft setting in, the
goods were afterwards laden Â«n board another
veflel, and exported to St. Croix : certificates
of the landing wherajf were delivered to the
collector of this port. Referred to the commit
tee of commerce and manufaflures-
Mr. Coit moved for the order of the day on
the report of the committee of commerce and
manufaflures on the petition of Pierre Joseph
Fiamend irt behalf of Louis le Guen ; which be
ing agreed to, the house resolved itfelf into a
committee of the whole on the fubjeift.
The petitioner states that on the 16th of Sep
tember, 1795, JVrl/iam Macarty, esq. thecon
ful of the United States, at the IJle of France
there Jhipped on board the brigantine Mary,
captain Rolertfon of Philadelphia, twelve
caflts of indigo cohligned to George Latimer,
cfq. of Philadelphia, owner ef the said brigan
tine who was desired to deliver the fame to the
bearer of the shipper's . ordersâthat the said
indigo arrived herein January 1796 ; was
duly entered at the Cuflom-houfc. and the duties
paid by George Latimer, efty -who flored the
fame, waiting for orders to whom to deliver
the fame < . and that these orders were de
layed by accidents of the sea, from arriving
till within the lufl fortnight, when Louis Le
Guen received the fame, and applied for the
indigo It Mr. Latimer, who delivered the
feime, and confirmed on oath all the f*3s above
Jlated, as far as rebate to him -but by the
delay tf the arrival of the letters of advice and
bills of lading, the time had elapsed in which the
indigo might be exported and be entitled to
drawbackâwherefore the petitioner prays for
an extention of time to export the said indigo,
with the usual allowance of drawback on 'ex
portation. The committee of commerce and
munufaclures were of opinion that as the loss of
time artfe only by the dijlance of the Isle of
France, and accidents to letters, and not by
any fault in the petitioner, and as there was
no probability of any precedent of this kind,
frequently oceuring, they thought it but jus) and
reasonable, the prayer of the petitioner should
be granted ; aud therefore recommend the house
to come to the following resolution
" Resolped,â That a committee be appoin
ted to bring in a bill in pursuance of the prayer
of the petitioner."
Mr. Swanwick moved that the committee
concur with the report.
This motiou called forth a confidenble de
bate. It was opposed by MefTrs. Coit, Gallatin,
J. Williams, Allen, Gordon, and Edmond, 011
the ground of its proving a dangerous prece
dent, as many cases might occur that would in
â  dace merchants to keep their gondii pad the
twelve months allowed by law, bttore they ex
posed them ; that no accident had occurred in
the business; that Mr. Le Guen. at the time of

would have proved them to be French property)
he chose the lefler evil of rilkine tfie loss of the
drawback ; that if persons chose to run these
rilks, tHe government had nothing to do with it,
ants rt ought to have no operation upon our laws;
but if fuhjefb of the belligerent p-'\ve.-s chose te

in their tavor. Mr. Allen, in particular, caA a
severe censure upon our consul at the J(le of

that to grant the prayer of the petition, would

LONDON, Oftober t6.
At the clnfe of the Comedy on Saturday
evening the curtain rofc again immediately,
and exhibited, iu honor of admiral Duncan's
vi&ory, the fpe&ade of .a sea fight, accom
pinied bv the songs of " Britannia,"
and " God save the King,*' in full chorus
and followed by a fire work. The songs of
course were encored.
The audience of-the evening was one of
the most nciff, we have fct with for forte
time past. The whole neighbourhood of
the Theatre was illuminated, as indeed was
the greater part -of the town,*veft of the ci
ty; Â«' uik' i ; n j
It is with great & we
understand, his moft graciously
exprefTed his intention to honor admiral
Duncan and his fleet with a visit. This eir
cumdance, we conceive, will be of the ut
most national utility. It will present to
Europe the proud fpeflacle of a Britifli
monarch twice, in the fame war, visiting in
person a vidtorious fleet j and we apprehend
it will have the mod beneficial eonfequences
with refpeft to otlr domestic feelings, and
the perfedt re-union of British seamen to the
warm wishes of their country.
It is remarkable, that the three most
brilliant naval viftories this war hava been
gained, the one by Lord Howe, an English
man; the other by Lord St. Vincent, an
Irishman; and the third by admiral Duncan
a Scotchman. And what still makes it more
remarkable is, that these gallant officers
have each beaten the enemy to which, rela
tively, their nations are nearest.âEngland
is nearer France nor either Scotland or
Ireland, Ireland is nearer Spain than either
England or Scotland ; and Holland is near
.er Scotland than any other of our enemies.
Odtober' 17.
A neutral ftirpon Sunday morning Hnder
â¢ took the kind office of conveying the abov,e
important intelligence to Calais. By this
time it has reached the Direftorial Palace!
The illumination of last night was gener
al, and equally brilliant with that displayed
in honor of lord Hawe's viSoty of the firft
of June. Most of the public, and private
buildings, exhibited fanciful devices in col
loured lamps, mottos, ice. The admiralty
in the Weft, and in the manlion house in
the city, were fplended in the extreme.
Admiral Duncan, who is now 63 years
of age, is nearly idatcd to lady Mary Dun
can. He is fix feet three inches high, his
fortune is about io,oool. half of which he
got as prize money at the Havannah, the
war before last. We believe he is married
to a relation of Mr. Secretary Dundas, by
whom he has three or four children.
Admiral de Winter was born in Demara
ra, when very young he served in the Dutch
"navy, but changed (hortly to their army,
which he afterwards quitted for the Rnffian
service, where he remained until 1786 or
1787, during the troubles fit Holland,
where he returned and sided against the O
range party, on whose success he went to
the French, with whom and his old friends
he returned when they conquered Holland.
Oftober 18.
Advice was yesterday received of the loss
of the Dutch (hip the Delft, of 56 guns, in
the Downs : very few of the hand*, it is
said, were saved.
Admiral Duncan states, in his second let
ter, that the Erdymion bad, in the course
of the night, fallen in with a Dutch (hip of
the line.off the Texel, and had engaged her,
but that he had not heard the particulars.
The engagement took place in the night;
and it is said, that owingÂ»to the heavy fire
of the enemy, the Endymion was obliged
to delift the contest.
Admiral Duncan's flag, with three other
(hips was seen from Harwich on their way
to the Nore on Monday.
" This moment" fays a letter from Yar
mouth, received yederdayj " I have retur
ned on fhorc from on" bftard the Hercules,
of 66 guns, whose captain lieswith his hand
(hot oft above his wri#, and woundtri in the
body; her mizen mad is Â£one, and (he is
torn to pieces. The frciiiid is the. Alhmaar
54 guns. Her, main trail went ia the
aft ion ; her mizen mtift was so wounded
that they were forced to cut it away after
we got possession of her ; and her fotemaft
went over in a gale of wind yesterday ; (he
is (hot to pieces, and was brought in by the
Monmouth with extreme difficultyâThe
Monmouth has alio \aken a 64. A rascal
011 board the Alkmaar yesterday attempted
to blow her up, and had got one of the locks
off the magazine.
The Hercules was on fire in the aÂ£tion,
and the after part of hef is very much dam
aged; the fire broke out afiefh after wc
had taken poliyV.on.
" Admirals Duncan and Onflow brfeaveJ
nobly ; the former had four on him at cue
time ; the latter three.
" A brig, armed .with iS,pounders, .had
the audacity to get under admiral Onflow's
stern ; he got fix guns to hear upon her, and
funk htr with every plan on board." 1
The circuniftanccs which gave the fir ft.
turn to this glorious victory, which will e
vcr be d'fh'nguifhed in the annals of Great-
Britain, arose from the Jupiter of 74 gun's,
with two admirals on board, being difmaft
fd, and alrrcft (battered to pieces, before
(he could bring a gun to bear on the Mon
arch of 74 guns, which raked her. This
was the iirft (hip that ft ruck. Admiral De
Winter's (hip did not frire much better from
the fire of the Venerable. Both (hips were
so unprepared for action at the moment,
that they could scarcely bring a gun to bear
until they had received tbt?fire of our {hips
repeatedly.
The obstinate bravery of the Dutch in
the battle was so grl-at, that when admiral
Winter surrendered, he was the only per
son on the quarter deck of the Vryheid,
and he is said to have been so for half an
hour ; every other officer having been killed
or WoundedâHaving performed his duty
in the most gallant manner, he appears, since
his capture to be in very good fpiritsj and
has paSed great part of his time in admiral
Duncan'3 cabin.
1 â¢ The ciraumftance of two admirals be
ing found on board the Vice-Admiral's ship
is owing to-the senior, who is infirm, having
wished to retire, which the Dutch govern
ment oppoftd, on account of his populari
ty with the seamen. A junior admiral was,
therefore, appointed to affid him in the
duties of his office.
When admiral Duncan made the signal to
break the enemy's line, the Dutch admi
ral, immediately perceiving his purpofc,
made the signal for his fleet to close, which
was very alertly obeyed, particularly by the
Vice-admiral. It was under the stern of
his (hip that admiral Duncan passed, andlm
mediately ranged up alongside. Itwasfe
ven or eight minutes before a gun was re
turned on that fideâa proof that they were
not ready.
We have dated that the king intends to
visit the victorious fleet as soon as they shall
be joined by the (hips that still remain out.
Earl Spencer, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Dundas
set off yesterday mornfng to congratulate
admiral Duncan, and prepare the fleet for
the reception of his majesty, who will fail
frem Greenwich in the Princess Auguita
yacht, captain Riou.
All the firft lieutenants of admiral Dun
can's fleet are immediately to be promoted
to the rank of matters and commanders.
Captain Fairfax left town yesterday in
the afternoon, with dispatches containing
the pateut for creating the brave old admi
ral a Peer ot Great-Britain.

OUR ENVOYS AT PARIS.
The " Annales Politiques," of the nth
of Oftober, fays, " On the 7th of Ottober,
the Three American Negotiators were prcfent
ed to the Minilter for foreign affairs, They
areâMr. Pinckney, of South Carolina,
who served with diftin&imi during the whole
of the war for American Independenceâ
Mr. Marshall, of the State of Virginia,
who also bore arms during the fame period,
but who has applied since the peace to the
study of law, and now occupies the situati
on of Advocate General of that stateâand
Mr. Gerry, of Massachusetts, member for
that state in Congress, where he is equally
diftinguiflied by his taints and his modera
tion-. These three men, who t\.fide more
than three hundred miles from each other,
art scarcely acquainted ! The firft time they
ever met was at more than a thousand leagues
from their country, to fulfil an important
million-! This confidence of the American
government, in citizens who never were em
ployed in diplomatic affairs, for renewing
the political and commercial relations of the
United States with France, gives us reafort
to presume that the government withes ra
ther tt> rely on the fidelity and candour of
the French government, than to feck a sup
port from the intrigue or the fineffe of men
(killed in the Machiavelifm of Cabinetsâ
This nomination, therefore, augurs the for
tunate issue of the negociation which is a
bout to commence."
It is anxioufiy to be hoped that this E
ditof may not be mistaken in his conje&ures
refpeÂ£ting the ifTue of the negociationâwe
cpuld wi(h we had a foundation on which to
build similar expectations.
NOBLS INTENTION.
A gentleman of Rotterdam, fays our last
Lotidon paper, has invented a new Float
ing Machine, which, though small, is ca
pable of hplding four men commodioufly j
and such is its astonishing conftrufiion, as
to defy the utmost fury of the seas, or the
refiftanct: of the mod boisterous winds. It
can neither ovtrfet nor fink, and may in all
weathers and gales bedeered whatever course
those within (hall deem neceflary. The phi
lanthropic views of the inventor are to fuve
the lives of those unfortunate mariners who
incur the danger of (hipwreck. It may be
made, on the fameconftrnÂ£tion large enough
to hold upwards of fifty persons.
