Mr. Fen no,
THAT contemptible and drunken vagabond
Tom Paine, who is notoriously destitute of every
honed principle, religious, moral or poiiticral, has
crowned his career of impudence and falfhood with
a letter addrefled in all the affe&ed familiarity of
democraticfamiliarity, Thomas Paine to George
Washington. Heavens! what a contralt.â
Exccflive vanity, dauntless impudence and extrava
gant falfhood are the prevailing ingredients in this
democratic dose. The poor, filly fat has been
railing at all the world unheeded and despised, and
expects now to call attention by the magnitude of
his object and the ridiculous extravagance of his
defamationâand what has set the madman roaiing ?
His dear friends have beeÂ» so ungrateful I
suppose he effefled their revolulion as >vel| as ours)
as to have given him a fraternal embrace ISI the
arms of a prifor>; and the PrefiHent o"f the United
States mod " unfeelingly" find in the ranknefs of
his ingratirude, neglected to arm the American na
tion in his behalf, and liberate this French citixen,
this member of the National Convention from his
imprisonment among the friendsof liberty and equali
ty. If he gave himfclf to the French, as certainly
he did, they had a just authority to dispose of him as
proper, and it would have been an
impertinent interference in t he internal affairs of a
great and magnanimous nation to have attempted
any controul in their treatment of him. If he en
tered into their fervuse and betrayed them, as he
did the committee of foreign affairs of the United
States, they had as fair a rigltt to imprifim him for
his offence, as congress had to dismiss him from
offiee.
1 his creature of avaricious poverty and deranged
ambition, who is the ready and devoted tool of
every faflion that will pay his pricc,âwho would
set the world on fire if he could find (ix prnce by
the lightâa"d advocate the climate and govern
ment of hell to be popular there, afiumes to him
felf a high rank in the American revolution. His
pen, it is true, was ufeful, whilil the head and
heart that dirt&ed it were deteftahle. The man
ner and means by which his talents in inflammatory
composition were engaged in favor of American li
berty, like evrry other known adl of his life, {hew
him to be aw unprincipled, mercenary wretch.
Dare he pretend that Â» Common Sense" was the vo
luntary effufion of his enthusiastic love of liberty ?
Did he come forward a willing and sincere advocate
of our eaufe, dire&ed by an honrft, patriotic prin
ciple, and acting with the zeal of freedom and si
delity ? On the contrary, is it not known, that he
was, ttt the commencement of our revolutionary
troubles, a decided friend cf the meafurea of Great-
Britain i And was he not fought out and employed
to -write on the American fide ? When thus fal
tered, persuaded, and, if I mistake not, paid, how
easily did he forfake his firft impreflions, for prin
ciples he has none, and violently oppose his former
friends and condu&. When peace crowned the
success of our arras, Paine emigrated to Enropeâ
The land of peace afforded no theatre for the ex
hibition of his factious and malignant talents. He
has no faerifices for her temple. Intrigue, faction,
war and desolation ire his divinitiesâTo them his
days and nights are confecratedâln their fei vice he
disregards every tie that unites man with his God,
his country and himfelfâ.His firft attack was upon
the tranquillity of Oreat-BritainâBut here he was
difgracefully defeated, and had well nigh left his
ears as the trophies of that defeat, and the security
of his good behavior. At this critical timi with
him, France presented a glorious scene for the ex
ercise as his talents â"1 hither he went, and for a
little while imposed on his new employers. He
was hailed on his artiv'l as the child and defender
of liberty, but was foen discovered to be a hypo
critical bastard of discord and faction, ahd driven
from all confidence and refpeft. He terminated
his expjoits in France as he did those in America
in difgraee and contempt.âThe rigorous policy of
that country confined him in a gaol, while the more
lenient raeafurts of this were content with discharg
ing hina from all offiee and trust. Are the ravings
of this disappointed madman to be attended to?
While I regret there was found any man in the
United States so base and hostile to the peace and
honor of his country as to publish this letter of in
famy, I comfort myfelf with believing that there
is but one man so loft, and that he is now so well
known that he can neither add to nor the
reputation of my country. DETECTOR.

COMMUNICATIONS.
Men of reading and reflettion long ago conclu
ded that Democrats were no republicans. It was
lately conceded in one of the Jacobin papers that
this was true. Its being true renders its rather the
more strange that it should be acknowledged. It
is so however, and Democrats take the name and
are welcome to it. It has worn badly enough, and
now their French pay-mailers have-cast it off (for
they now reprobate democracy in Paris) our imita
tive gentry seem to claim it as if like running foot
men they had a clear right to the second-hand suit
of those whom they serve. The name fits them
admirably, as it means that anarchy which rulÂ»s the
confirmed authorities or survives their definition.
The use that lias been made of the name, to deceive
â¢firft, and, then to plunder, suits the hypocrisy, the
licentiousness, or the need of the different feds
that form the democratic party. The credulous
dupes may be left out as a diftinft fefl, for
the faÂ£l is, the) do not keep together in a body,
but are scattered among the others, according to the
chara&cr of the leader they happen to enlifl under.
In the lage of despair, an attempt has been made
to difgraee the chara&er of federal-republican. De
finitions have been quoted from books, implying that
it is the power of a few which is meant by re
pablicanifm, &c- But these are proofs of that fort
of pedantry and indocility which is not made mo
dest by confciout ignorance, nor wife by reading.
Let the party be ftiled demosrats, far two rea
ions. First, it describes the fort of politics they
would introduceâand secondly, it is ft name alrea
dy difgrjeed aud fits the wearers.
Paragraph from the .furora.
" When Mr. Parker asked wiiÂ«t had become of
Mr. Ames's patriotism during the revolution, he
arose, and laid nothing on that fubjeft."

Mr. Ames was then a boy. It is a point yield

a saleable virtue. It is denied that it is a boyish
one.
THE DEMONIACâNo. 11.
From the Aurora ofTrJltrday.
What ! is not 15,000 dollars a year, drawn out by
anticipation, a compensation fufficient for the official
duties of the President; ard is he h'mfelf to declare
his count: y still in his debt, by boaftingofhis dilinter
eltednefs ? Ths law fays that 35,000 dollars .1 year
fhali be a compensation tor his fervic.es, an.t real'on fays
it is quire enough.
It has been said, that ingratitude is the crying fia of
republics I hold a contrary dodtrine, that gratitude te
individuals is their greatest crime, and oftener leads to
slavery than any other cause. When a citizen is called
by the voice "this country to an important station, he
is honoured, a.id his best exertions,on!y can repay the
debt of gratitude he owes his country. While he is in
thefervice of his country he receives a eompenfation,
in full for his time and trouble, and when he retiies
after having done his duty, h - has but done his duty.
If a balance remains, it is of gratitude due the people
by the individual, for the honor conferred on him.
A contrary deilrine will make slaves of us all.
The malice of Jacobin hearts is well known ; â
but there seems fometjiing inexplicably wrong in
the make and operation of their brain
The President is denied, in the Aurora, all claim
to gratitude, because, if he has done wellâ(mind
the impudence of that if) âhe has done 00 more
thin his duty, which he is paid by his salary for
doing. GrÃtitude, when it goes beyond that, would
endanger the liberty of a republic.
This is lather a new doctrine. When the Au
rora gives details of French victories, the eSitor is
never tired, though his readers are, of the praises
due to the French toldiers, because, they did their
duty in the battle. Why praise Frenchmen for do
ing their duty ! They have bread, and meat, and
wages. If the President were a Frenchman, would
he be entitled to praise and thanks ?
Put a plainer cafe. Is not the Aurora deserving
of praise, for its hardy zeal in the cause, beyond
the ordinary reward of the fubfeription money ?
Surely it is worth more than money to exult at the
prjfpedt of otir being involved in disputes with
France, our trade preyed HpÂ»n, and our nation
snubbed and spit upon, as if it was St. Domingo,
or a party-coloured rabble of Victor Hughes's men.
To exult in this cafe, to juitify the aggreflors, and
to join in condemning America, is meritâit is more
than dutyâand justly claims fomeother reward than
money.
RICHMOND t (Virginia,) Dec. 10, 1796.
AN ANECDOTE.
At the late ele&ioo of a Prelident and Vice Pre
sident, a gentleman of the name of Leven Powell,
had wisdom and firmnefs enough to rote for George
Washington and John Adams, notwithllanding the
inlidious arts of the elettor from Caroline, to in
duce a belief that it was edeatial far America to
conciliate with the French dire&ory, by voting for
Thomas Jefferfon. At thÂ« play en the lall even
ing, a certain Ifliam Randolph, supposing himfelf
surrounded by birds of a feather, undertook to call
upon the Orchestra, for " God save the king, for
Leven Powell !"âthe intended wit created a demo
cratic grin for the moment, but a young gentleman
by the name of Cheller, demanded of Randolph
what he meant ? Nothing fir, cried the Poltroon'
very well, if you meant nothing, it may be easily
fettledâthere fits Mr. Powell, tell him you meant
nothing, and ale his pardon. He did so, and sa
ved himfelf from the chaftifcment he deserved.
CONGRESS OF -the UNITED STATES.
IIOUSI OF REPRESENTATIVES.

Wednesday, December 14.
Continuation of the debate on the address in answer
to the President's speech.
Mr. Swanwick did not know that any gentleman
had objected to that part of the paragraph in question
which spoke of our grateful sense of the kindness of
providence, for the benefits we enjoyed ; but it was
the impropriety of contraliing our situation with that
of other nations which was principally objeifted to.
And was it right, he asked, to tell Providence that ws
were more enlightened than nations ? certainly
not, rather let us rejoice that it is so, but not offend
others by making our bonds of it. Mr. Swanwick
again noticed the losses sustained in our commerce,
from the Britilh, French and Alfcerincs. The only
remedy for which he believed was a naval force. Was
this, he aikcdacaufe for exultation : He thought not.
He feared the revenues of this country would certainly
fuffcr from the present stagnation of commerce. He
had himfelf experienced confirfcrable leffes ; but the
evil was not a partial but a general one ; and, as he did
not feel the prosperous situation in which this courtfry
was painted, he could not confcnt to violate his feelings
by expressions contrary to them. The pentleman
from Mafiachufetts ( Mr. Ames) in the .last leffion
spoke at great length, on the horrors of war; which
he looked upon as inevitable, if the Britilh treaty then
under difcuflion, was not carried into effect. But now,
when a profpefl of war, appears from another quar
ter, its miferie* seem to be forgotten, and he almost
calls his country to the conflict. He left the gentle
man to account for such inconsistency.âThe fame
gentleman had made a companion of a fliipwreck,
which he thought totally inapplicable. Were the na
tions to which this country were compared in a state
of shipwreck ? If we consult their own account of
themlclves, as he had before they called them
felres the molt free and enlightened. Mr. Swanwick
concluded by laying that he neither discarded Provi
dence, nor was willing to think too lowly of our
prosperity, but he did not wish to make our boast, as
to rifle the offending of other nations.
On a call for the committee to rife ( it being past
three o'clock.) A motion was put o that effedi, and
loft 43 to 31.
Mr. Giles hoped the committee would have risen,
that he might to-morrow have had an opportunity of
replying to feme obfervatiors which h2d fallen from
different gentlemen; for though he thought he had
exprefied himfelf so as nor to be misunderstood, it seems
he was KiilUkea. It was net wonderful, he said, that :
tlie pnpu'arity of the President .".ould lie drtHVn inft
this debate. It had heen too common to do this; J>ut
he truited the weight which was wished to be given
to arguments from that circumfiance would not le
very great ; andjas to the committee who prepared the
address before them having been unanimous in agree
ing to it, that would have little effeit upon him. TTe
cared not for the unanimity of that committee tho'
it appeared strange that the fail !h uld havÂ» been as sla
ted. It had been complained that if the Prefideut
not to be complimented upon his wifd -m and firmneis
in his administration, there would be 110 room left ior
compliment. He was of a difi'e. ent opinion. At an/
rate he was unwilling to allow his adminiflration had
been wife and firm. Gentlemen had called upon hi.ft
to produce instances of his want of wisdom and firm-'
, ness. He laid he would not seek for more than one,
I which was in the cale of the Britith treaty, the coale
quence of which he believed w as the preleut m funder
fiandnlg with the French government ; for though
many *>ffe nee were mentioned in the Fit ; '1
minifler'a note which had taken place prior to the Bri
; tifh treaty, yet as these grievances had never before
beer, spoken of, it was evident that the British treaty
had called them forth. *nd gentlemen might lay
what they pleased about the law of nations, no neutral
nation ought to grant that to one belligerent
which fh'juld prove an injury to its rival. Lojfc at
Europe, said he, and fee what joy was (hewn hy Bri
tain on the aecomplifhment of the late treaty, and with
what contrary feelings it was received by France.
The gentleman from MafÃuhufetts ( Mr. Ames)
when the British Treaty was the fuhjeCt was over
eomi by the pr-ofpeft of war, but now he feemid
willing to embrace all those horrors, and was Inud
in his calls of support of the exacutive. Hefpr' e
of foreign influence, and called upon the world to
judge between them. He supposed us upon the
eve of war with France. If so he wou'.i 'imind
the house tliat such an event would be a difaflrous
one to this country, as 110 nation had thepmvei of
injuring tis mote than the Frenth, and none that
we had it in our power less to annoy. Yet that
gentleman exclaimed, Now is the time ro come
forth to support the govcri mem ! The War-hoop
and Hatchet, of which the gentleman spoke la It
session so feelingly had now loft all their horror. If
this fitu.fcijn was produced by the improper con
dud of the exe&ti**, it was enough to prevent
him from giving his vote in favour of the Prefi.
dent's wife and firm admi'iiflration. But the oen
tlemao fiom S. Carolina (Mr. Smith) said there
was an atrepipt to divide the Prifident from the
other branches of the government. Mr. Giles said
the President had no advice in this bufii'tfs hut that
of the Senate. He would ask that house, he would
ask all America, whether, if that iijjti uitent-hsd
been laid upon the table of that house, before it
had received the fandlion of the Executive, ii t
would have been approved there ? He wag certain
it would not. It was his opinion, i: was the opi
nion of hisconftituents, that it was a rui.i'ous mea
sure, and this would, ere long, be the opinio# of
America.
The gentleman from Pcnnfylvania (Mr. Sk
greaves) had compared our notice of the calamitous
fitaation of Europe to a man cautioning his family
against the fellies of his neighbours: but, said Mr.
Giles, suppose that neighbour was present ? They
were carrying on a convention about (he French
nation, which would be published. He believsd
indeed, that an organ of a foreign nation had been
present during the debate. How then would the
comparison of the gentleman bear ?
Gentlemen had been charged with a desire of
striking out the expressions of our grateful sense of
the Jcindnefs of Providence ; but was it not knowrV,
that the motion to strike out, was with a view tf
introducing something more tiflrxceptioriabla when
recommitted ? He thought there was scope enough
to compliment the Prelident, without pipnino gen*
tleuien down to write Scoundrel on their own fore
heads, by expressing approbation of measures*
which they had always opposed i he hoped there
fore, the motion would prevail, and the anfiver
would be recommitted.
Mr. Williams said, although he vras convinced
that the neceflary attention would not *be paid to
any obfqvations made at that late hour, yet he
would not be fatisfied by giving a silent vote on
luchan important occauon. He wou'rd, therefore
beg the indulgence of the hou'fe for a few moments)
while he went over some objedlioiis which had been
dated by Mr. Giles. Mr. Williams said, it was no
new thing to be told by that gentleman, chat the
President's popularity would influence the house, or,
that he (Mr. Giles) would , fay he would speak
his own opinion. Mr. Williams hoped he
fcould be credited in not only speaking his own o
pinion, but that of his cenHiiucnts, when he said
the address to the President was founded on truth)
and this afiertion, said Mt. Williams, is confirmed
by the proceedings not only of the legi(lÂ«ture of
the (late he had the honour te represent, but ?.lfo
that of the gentleman's own Hate, together with all
the different legislatures in tlw union, which had
been in session since the Prefix wit's farewel address.
But, said Mr Williams, the gentleman (Mr. Giles)
appears to have summed up his Â»bjÂ«aions to the
wildom and fitmnefsof the President in two points.
The one was, refpefting the- British treaty, and the
other, that of his having his name in the journal?
of this house, in opposition to the adminiltratton
t ,x,fr eCUt ' V f- Wlth ref P t,S t0 the fi't.
Mr. Williams, this nation had a right to enter into
a treaty with Great-Britain," or it could not he
said we were an independent peopje ; and he trust.
Ed we (hould be juftified in so doing by France
Did not the ambnfTador of France, in 1778 d . ,
liver , paper to the British court, declaring,' that
the French nation had entered into a treaty with
the United States, and at the fsr.e time, 'stated
that great attention had been paid by the contrac
ting parties, not to iiipulate any exclulive advantage
to the French nation, and that theie w?s reserved,
on the part of the United States, the liber'y of
treating with every other nation whatfover, upon
the fame footing of equality and reciprocity. But,
fays the gentleman (Mr. Giles) no advantage ought
to pe given to an eliemy. Mr. Williams ohferved,
that be was convinced that no advantage was rive 1
to Britain ; but, ort the contrary, the article com
plained of, mull, in. its operation be beneficial to
I'rance; as it is an encouragement for American
vefiels to go to their ports. It ensures them aoaM j
loss, if they happe 1 to be interrupted in their v â¢
age.Mr. Williams that with refpeft to thf
gentleman''! oSjeft ons refpefting the Journals, he
hoped, that, as the opjofiiton was against the Pre
fiJest, for his in nnt being drawn in
to a war, to embrue ourjiands in the blood of one
nation, to gra ify the hatred, or serve the interest
of another, we fh uild now (at it was >lie lad time)
agree to the report, andaltbo' thfc gentleman (Mr.
Giles) supposed it to be the interest of France to
go to war with us, yet hr did not think so ; but if
ic was their interest, nothing would (lop
It was the interest of this country to be at peace,
and he would do Â«very thing confident with the
honour of bu> nation keep so.
Let us, said Mr. Williams, individually endea
vour to eradicate from our minds those opinions,
which we may haÂ»e allowed to acquire a growth
thât overfhades the dilates of unbiased truth and
justice ; let us each individually confjder, whether
we have not Allowed our immediate and particular
interells to influence our public condu-t ; and wir4i

Th'e ccmm ittee rose, had le,.ve to-fit again, and
the house adjourned.
Thursday, December 15-
In Committee of the whole house. on the answer to
the Prefidents'i kddrefs.
Mr. Nicholas halt vifhrd to have had this business
fettled as agreeably as possible. He thought himfelf
at liberty to Vote for the paragraph now before the
com ittee, because he was faiisfled that the pi efent
admin, ration had, in many instances been wile ar.d
firm. InriAiE a Irefs it could no.t be meant to include
pending meitfures. â¢ He should think himfelf wrong if
heforehore.o expreisthc â¢ gret .which hk, conftuuents
felt tor the retiring or ti 1 e I'refident from offne. Mr.
N eholas, however, ccnfiSercd the style of compli
mei as too strong. âHe imagined that it might be
bett i-Mprefled for the fake of general accommoda
tion to 11.e ftntimi nts of members.
Mr. Rutherford Umen ed that gentlemen should
have a milt.iked zeal for the Frefiden' by introducing j
expedients into the answer before them which could;
jiot be fwlifcribed unanimously. The division of fenti- j
tnent which had taken place in the Jioufe on the ocea- s
lion, would give the world an idea that there was a j
putv who criminate the President, 3nd to j
rfb him of those patriotic virtues which he polFefied. f
There was no'uch thing. Eveiy oneand his c. ileagucs j
amcngd; the reft, esteemed the virtues of that great 1
man; and if there had been any flip in his condufl,
the American people were generons and knew that to j
err was human, and that other perfonswere equally to â¢
blame with hi.n He was sorry, therefore to fee so
warm a zeal, endeavouring to grasp at too much.
They werf not only toxonfider the wisdom and patri
otism ot our chief magidrate and great deliverer un
der divine providenee but also the situation 111 which
we stand with refpeft to the Republic of France. We
seemed to be in a delicate situation, and we ought to
ai3 with the greatest coolness and circlimfpedtion.
He therefore hoped, the answer would be so amended
as to pass unanimously.
Mr. Livingdon honed the answer to the address
of the Prelidetit would have been so drafted, as to
have avoided this debate, hie (I'll hoped, that the
candour of the gentlemen who advocated iliin ad
dress, and of those who opposed it, would admit
of fu h amendments, as might make it pÂ«fs unani
mously. With this view, when the piefent motion
was difpofrd of, he should move to itt ilce out some
words, for the purpose of inserting otl.eti. He had
not the f<me pinion of the firft paragraph propos
ed to be I 1 11 k out by the gentleman from Virgi
nia with other gentlemen. It did not appear to
him to draw confutation from the misfortunes of o
ther nations ; and the comparison of a gentleman,
who had likened our litualion tÂ» that of members
of the fame family, had considerable weight upon
his mind. The only objection he had to the para
graph, was to the single exprcfiion of Â«' tranquil
prosperity." He did not think that the present fi
tuatinn of the UniteJ States would warrant such
an exprefiion. There hmilar objections to o
ther pai-tsof the address, which might- easily be re
moved by amendments. He should therefore votea
gaintl (liikingout the eight clauses.ii order that ihey
might be amended, so as to prove generally accept
able.
Mr. Giles's motion was then put and negatived_
Mr. Parker wished to renew his motion for fink
ing out the words "freeft and mofl enlightened ia
the world."
Mr. Harper believed his motion would fupercede
that of the gentleman just fat dowÃ, because it
.contemplated the finking out of a greater portion
of the answer, and because it had already been
fuhtni ted to the hotife. Having already given his
Teafons for wishing his motion to prevail, he should
not again trouble the house with them, but merely
submit it to their decision. Jt was to strike out all
that part of the answer, from the words " retire
ment from office," at the end of the seventh, para
graph, to the words " may you long, &c." at the
beginning of the lafl; and to insert " and to avail
ouifelves of this occasion, since no suitable one may
heteaftcr occur, of disclosing those warm emotiooi
of refpeft, gratitude and affection, with which we,
nolefs than our constituents, have been inspired bjr
a life, equally illudrious for the wisdom, integrity
and patriot ism whereby in public conduct have been
guided, and fortunate in the happy influence which
the exercise of those virtaei has produced on the
prosperity of our country."
Â« Mr. Freeman obje&cd to the substitute offered
by Mr. Harper, because it did not contain a feati-
Hient in the original which he very much approved,
viz. " Yet we cannot be unmindful, that your mo
deration and magnanimity twice displayed by retir
ing from your exalted stations, afford examples no
less rare and indruftive to mankind, than valuable
to a republic."
Mr. Harper he had no objection ts the ad
miffmn of that fentimcnt into his substitute.. which
<afily be done.
1 Mr. Ames hoped the motion to strike out wsuH
not prevail. Ihe original, he said, having been
printed and in the hands of members, had the ad
vantage of being well weighed, and he trusted ge
nerally approved : but any substitute would not
have that advantage, beft.lesthat he ihotight the
Sentiments being crowded together iu the way pro
posed, would drag Ijeavily along.
The motion was put and negatived, there being
only 25 votes foi it.
Mr. Parker then urged his motion.
Mr. W. Smith hoped tha words in question
would not be druck out. The reason aligned yes
terday fordriktng out these words was that thiv
might offend other nations who conceived them
selves :.s free and enlightened as we. Gentlemen
did not fay wh t nation wntild take umbrage; but
he supposed they alluded to the French reptibli<.
If, however, he could shew those gentlemen tha t
that republic had uled a fimilitf language, in wtrich
they called themselves the grealefl nation in the
world, he trull :hhey wou'd feci easy as far as tc
fpedled any offence to 'hem. In looking ovei'
some papers, he had met with fever a! bomballical '
expressions in a note of Baithe'cmy s, a report to
the convention of Liaiiviere, sn.l of CumHaceres in
the mm; of the three committees He iead
and hoped they would remove from the minds of
gentlemen all ideas of offence to the French repub
lic.
Mr. Parker said, he m ide this motion he I
neitluT had the F ench Republi: in view nor pny o
ther nation His objection o'he expression was,
that if we were more free and enligh ened than o
thers, it was not becoming in tis to nuke the decla
ration. Our government, ht said, was as free as
any inexi.tence; and as to our being enlightened,
we might be more so than otheis. His ohjeclion
went againd the declaration. But, however enlight
ened we might be, our enlightened uriderllanding
had been far exceeded by-Deumatk and Sweden,
who had p'refeived their neutrality amidst tljej irring
intcrefls of ituropeâtheir vessels could pals uamo
led ed on the ocean ; eyen the Helvetic Republic'

Was this, be afkr.l, preferring our digni' y ? When

quietâto Ihu: ouifelves up in a (hell like a Tor.
toife. Pea e was to be preserved at any rate ; wh/fl
the British were frizing our property and inipreffing
our seamen, whom they f ourged and treated ia the
mod cruel manner, yet a'l must be (till, not a word
about reliflance. When the Executive feiit an En

What was the result ? A Treaty. This
was the aft of an adminiflration which they uere
called upon to appl ud. He yet believed the Pre
liderit wife and virtuous, but he had, perhaps, per-,
sons about him who had advised him to this unwil'c
and impolitic aft
The gentleman from Maffj' hufetts (Mr. Ames)
had told them, we were on the eve or a war with
France ; the greatell nation, said Mr. Parker, on
earth, a nation who was fighting in the cause of h
berty, and who had carried bet vietoijfs to every
part of Europe, whose exploits in war Rorye never
exceeded. This he thought was not a fitu.ttion in
which to exult. We may, said he, think well of
ourselves. He believed the people to be wife, the
government good, but the adminillratioH bad. The
gentleman from Mafiachufeus had said, we are dc
firuus of peace ; but if the Fr. nch are determined
011 war, we are ready to meet them. Where heaf
ked, were our (hips, or out armies ? This gentleman
had told them lafl feflivn of the tomahawk and of
the mother bleeding over her hild. He would not
deal in metaphor with tha! gentleman, but he would
ask him for his confidency. Why peace with Eng
land, but with France, fay we are ready to meet !
them ? Where was the lafl war ? Did he meet the i
enemy ? He believed not. But addsci he, I saw
such cruelties committed by the British, as would
make the flouteft shudder!
Mr. Parker said when Gen. O'Hara left Portf
mauth he went into it and fonnd a house as large as
that hall full of people ill of the small pox, many of
them blind, whom O'Hara had left without a nurle
or any assistance.âThe gentleman from S. Carolina
had seen a British eourt ; he had not. He had seen
some of their lord s indeed, but he found them like other
fmen.âlf, he faiil, ihe French made war upon this
country,he should certainly fight against them. He
did not fear them ; but he disliked to take up arms
againftafrre people. Kingcraft and Prieftcraft had
too long governed the world with an iron rod : more
enlightened times, he trusted, were approaching and
he hoped ere long republicanism would cover the earth
âHe wished the words to be itruck out.
Mr Harper said he did not feel the least difpoGtion
to follow the gentleman just fat down through" his een
fures on our own adminillration. Nor did he fee what
relation this had to the matter in hand. The question
was, whether we ihould make the declaration before
them or not. And lie thought the thing of little coa
fequenee ; because, if we were the most free and en
lightened, it was well, and other nations would fee it
Why, then, travel into a field of inveflive against ad
ministration. Suppose this was as base as he could
make it, it would not follow that all the reft of Ameri
ca were wicked. If all his aflcrtioiis were true, there
fore, he might vote against his own motion.
A great deal, Mr. Harper â¢bferved, had been
said about pacifice intentions, war, &c. Strangers,
or gentlemen who had net heard the whole Â»f the
debate, would suppose, that the question before the
committee was the fubjeft of a declaration of war,
tho' Jx was merely to determine whether we should
call ourselves free and enlightened. Yet the gen
tleman from Virginia was very pacifically inclined to
all natious. The sum and fubftanee of the whole
ftoty was, that this gentleman was pacifically in
ciined towards the nation which seemed to have hof.
tile views against this cauntry. He hoped, how
ever, they IhouM oot eater Â«a fields of discussion,
which could enljr fcrve to irritate End prolong the
business, nor give scope to their recollection of every
thing that had been pleaflngor difpleafmg to them,
but vote on the simple question. The gentleman
from Virginia had said, that when compared to
Denmark, Sweden, or the Helvetic republie, our
. administration had beeuveiy unwise indeed. Now
it happent, fat'd Mr. Harper, that the gentleman
has been very unfortunate in his comparison ; for
Sweden and Denmark submitted to the fame kind
of treatment which we have submitted to. At to i
the Swiss cantont, thiy were in alliance with the
only Ration that could fuccefsfully annoy them, ow
ing to their inland and mountainous situation. He
j did not fee therefore any wisdom in their condutt.
Whilst, said he, with many difficulties on our hands,
we have (till preserved peace, Snd efeaped the effe&s
of European broils, much better than any of us
expe&ed.
[Debate to be continued.J
MonÂ»ay, Becember 19.
The milii in bill was taken up in committee of
â¢lite whole. The fitll provides for a division
of the militia into two clatles, the firft to comprise
those between 20 and 25 years of age, the other
rbofe between 25 and 40; the firft clafl to devote
a ronfiderable portion of time in military duties,
the other to lie conflicted as a corps de reserve. The
principle of this fe&ion was ohje&ed to, on account
'chiefly of the gieat expense of time and money
whici) tjie execution of the pian would require, and
it was moved to ftrikeit out. A motion, however
was made for the rising of the committee, which
obtained, and the committee obtained leave to fit
again.
On motion of Mr. Livingfton, a committee was
appointed to enquire and report, by bill or other
wise, what alterations appeared necefiary in thepe
nal code of the United States.
A petition from Stephen Moylan, commissioner
of loans lor the ft ate of Pennsylvania, praying an
ercreafe of salary, was read, and referred to the
committee on that fubjeA.
| Mr. Gallatin obtaiised leave of absence for ten
! days.
Mr. Harper moved, that the committee bf the
whole fbould be difefnrrged from further
the militia bill, with a view that it should be re
committed to a fcleft committee. The motion was
"iTFgatived. '
On motion of Mr. Heath, resolved, that a com
mittee be appointed to enquire whether any and
what alteration ought to be made in the existing
law?, to enforce the payment of monies due the
United States, by the different officers of the reve
nue. Adjourned.

â  occasion to pay the highest tribute of praise to the

the Oration a mod masterly composition, and that
it was pronounced with all the ability of an Qra

THE dwelling house is built of stone, two stories high,
