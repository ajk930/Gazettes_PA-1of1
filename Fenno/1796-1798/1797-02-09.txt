New-Haven, OtSober 7, ijf6.
Dear Sir,
I Ihould have written you last week, had I then been
able to afcerraia certain fads, the rumour of which I had
heard. A Mrs. Beers, a near neighbour to mt. the wife
of Xben Beers, and daughter of captaia Samuel Hoggips,
of this town, had been, for fourteea weeks, exceedingly
diflreffed with the Rheumatism, to fach a degree that for
fourteea weeks' previous te the 19th of last m'onth, lhe
had not been able to walk across the room even with crut
ches, save only once, when (he made out with the affill
auce of cratches to hobble part of the way aero s her room.
Oa the 19th of September last, (he procured a set of your
metallic substances, and in less than an hour after she had
began to use them, in the manner direfied by you, she
rose from her chair, and walked about herhouie, and on
the next day lhe went abroad to her neighbours, having
thrown aside her crutches. I h.(vÂ« this day paid her a visit
in company with her lather, and Timothy Jones, Esq.
who lives in the-ftreet where she resides and direilly op
pofit". to her rofidence, and With Capt. Abel Burrett, who
is her next neighbor, and lives within eight yards of her
door. I reqaelted her to relate her cafo over in their
prefcascfc, wkich flic did. ? n 1 tbefc gawtlemeia all .with Qua
voice, supported, from their own knowledge, her story.
It is a duty which yoa Owe yourfelf and the world to pre
â > mulge this event. I am, very lefpetftfujly,
Your obedient ltrvaut,
PIRRPONT Â£0 WARDS .
N. B. She fays her fever has left her, her appetite has
returned, and she is in a fair way to be reltored to perfect
health.
Rev. Mr. Spalding, of Salem.
This may certify, that the fubferfoer, in bis visits among
his people, has used Dr. Perkins's metallic points, to re
lieve paips and inflammations of various kinds, and has
succeeded to his allonifhment. They have feWom failed
l to relieve the head-ach, tseth-ach, ague m the face, in
flammation in the jyes, cramp ; cholic, rbeamatifm, pains
â¢ of the bresft ahd lid , biles, IcUs and burnsâSometimes
there has heen a jaerfedt cure from one operation. A lad
who had been confined three days with high lymptoms of
a fever, very hot and full of pain, by an operation of the
points, designed to relieve his head, his face turned pale
ar.d cold, hii fever and pain immediately left him, aad in
a few days he was oat of deors ; the year before, at he
fame season, he was taken the fame symptoms, aad
Jay extremely sick torty days. Ti?e efficacy of the metal
lic points has gained great credit in this town.

1 certify, that on the lift of March, 1796, I saw Dr.
Wrir ,mr> V.y n*. 1-7?tvr -mlv.
tried with fuccelsinthe poor-honfeor betteriag-houfe in
Philadelphia ; especially npoa a man who was unable to
lilt his right hand to his head, as was tried beforehand, bnt
â¢who after a few minutes operation, yas able to remove it
at pleafurc ; and in my fight, put it witheafe oa the top
of his head and back of his neck, and in all direilions.
Nearly the lame effect took place upv.' 1 a woman j and
all that I saw treated, profeffed that their paios --eased
after being treated ji lhort time : aad several came volun
tarily, and in my hearing thanked the Dr. lor cures he
â had performed on them about eight weeks before, in re
moving pains from them, which they declared had not
since returned : âfo that from what 1 saw with my own 1
eyes, and what 1 have heard, I have (great hopes that this
. method will greatly tend to alleviate the trileries of man

Dr. Perkins's invention for removing pains from the
human body, begins to obtain reputation in proportion
to its utility and efficacy. The flmplieity of the operati
on was at lirft an obftade to its credit; lut the floodof e
videace in its favor, from aitual expe. â¢ -nt, is at length
too powerful to be refilled.

In the fit ting of the loth inft tbc plan Â»f the
rfÂ»n ,l :to:ioÂ» of the Batavian people was at length
r btbfc&e 'Canv.ention. But
been railed even before It was read, the convention
decreed, that the reading of it fhovld be poftponcd
. until next Monday. Citizen Van Kafteele said,
hereupon,' that after' the plan had been read, he
fhoald give his opinion on the fubjeift, as it ftrnck
him that the plan was by nÂ© means founded an the
balis of an indivjhble republic, and confidently
eould neither answer the expectation of the conven
tion, nor meet the wilhes of the people.
Don Joseph d'Anduaga, ihe Spanish minifler
lately arrived here, prcfemed his credentials the
day before yeflcrday.
The plan of the constitution has been printed for
the members of the convention, but at the fame,
if time it has been prohibited ou pain of 60C10 guild
" ers to print a single copy for any one else.
The representative JCalteele was supported by
J fpveral other members in his aflertian, that the plan
of the constitution did not aim at nnity and tndi
i- visibility, but at federalifm. The difcu(T)on of this
- plan is thetef â  a liely to bting on very intetefting
e : and animated debates.
j All the foreign mmift?rs were invited to the Gt
y ting of the loth inliant, When tbe plan of the con
n flitution was laid before the convention.
The reprefeotatire Velleer was yesterday eleifl
v ed president of the convention.
j The troops embarked at Dunkirk on board 16
tranfperts, had not (ailed from thence on the Ift
e instant. Their deliination remains as yet a secret,
* but it is Hated in a letter from Paris ef tbe 7th
instant, that the ainiament isdcltined for the mouth
3 of the Elbe, to intercept the communication of
c the English with the continent. 1
Fourteen Englilh men of war and several armed

Boiffy d'Anglas observed, that jt was aecelTary
to modify the laws us divorce, and tdeprive theÂ«}

brought to Falmouth by the Sylph brig. The
dispatches from Sir John state, that he J*ad looked
into Brett, where were ferenteen {ail the line,
with a prodigious number of transport* and llatbot
toraed boats, ready for sea ,j and hp had learnt that
80,000 troops were in readiness to embark. Thie
account, of the ay'hentieity and accuracy of which
no doubt whatever can be entertained, differs motfc
materially from other intelligence recently received.
About ten days ago an f rmament confiding of
some .gun boats, small armed reSTels, and rtanfports,
failed from the Road of Havre, haying 6000 trcop?
on board. They bad fcarceljr got out of the Road
when a gale of wind cane on, in which fereral of
the boats were wrecked, and all the men on board
of them drowned. The reft of this armament re

superior force; for Crentznach lies so entirely ui- 1
der the fire ef the' hills from the left bank of the
river, that the enemy is always mailer of that 1
.place, as was fufficieatly, proved by the affair of '
the 11 th of December 1795- On this fide Cieutz >
nach, the heights are lo distant from the river, that
the enemy has every facility in extending himfelf ]
in front on each flank of the town ; and a corps of 1
â¢very inferior force take pod near en#ugh to prevent <
this formation. !
On the 26th generals SimpafchÂ«n and Rofem 1
burg weYe attacked by two divisions of the army of 1
Sambre and Meufe. The action laded fevered hours,
and the enemy, notwithdanding so very great an 1
inequality of numbers, was tepulfed with confidet
able loss. '
Early on the 27th the French renewed their at
tack, and advanced in several columns from Creutz
nach, to turn the left of the Atidrians ; but the
latter, by an exertion of much'ability and steadi
ness, maintained their position. In the evening,
however, the generals, in conformity to the orders
mentioned ' above, determined on retiring behind
the Seltz.; and the retreat was executed with per
fect order.
The loss of the Audrians on this occasion con
.lifts of 19 killed, 184 wounded, 96 miffing ; on
the whole, 2,99 men and 89 horses.
The enemy's was peitatsly considerable ; 20G
as them were taken prisoners and brought into
Mayencc.
1 am thai circumityitialin (latinjt the particu
lars of this, in fact, unimportant affair, because 1,
observe that the official reports efthe army of Sam
bre and Meufe, 1 mean the late ones, contain the
mod absurd exaggerations. I (hould consider them
undeserving of notice, were it not that
those who have no other means of judging of the
event of the campaign than by comparing the a?-
Â«ounts published by the contending armies, would
be IJd into the mod erroneous concluiiona if they
gave each party credit for only an equal degree of
fairnefs in their relations.
In the enemy's official account of the affair of
the 21ft of lalt month near Neuwied, it is repre
sented as having been a serious and general attack ;
whereas it was merely undertaken for the purpose
of dedroying his bridge, and spreading alarm on the
left bank of the Rhine. Both these objects were
effeÂ£led by a very infignificant force ; and there was
not the fmalled idea of making a serious assault on
the Tete-de-Pont of Neuwied. The enemy dates,
that besides an immense number ef killed and
'drowned, he actually took 1000 prisoners, whereas
I c?n aflure your lordlhip, from the mod authentic
information, that the whole loss of the
did not exceed 284 men.
After general Moreau's army had crrfled the
Rhine, two divisions of it were detached towards
Landau, and one division of the army of Sambre
and Meufe arrived about the fame time in the
neighborhood of Kayferflautern. General,. Hatze
was still at Schweigenheim, on the road frora Spey
er to Landau ; his corps was not of fufficient
strength to have any other objedt than that of
â  -spreading alarm in Alsace : find it wag evi
dent, that as soon as the Rhine should again sepa
rate the main armies, the enemy mud fmmediaU'ly
become maders of the vicinity of Landau.
Genetal Hotze, therefore, oir the approach of
forces infinitelyfuperior to those of hie own, re
tired towards the cfitrencbed camp at Manheiip,
without being in the fmalled degree molested by the
enemy. He ellablifhed the aiiwnced pods of his
left wing on the Reebach, from whence they ran
along the Pletz towards Franckenthal.
On the 7th instant, the French attacked general
Hotze'fi line. Their principal efforts were Jired
Â«d againd the left wing, and the fire of the attil
leiy and small arms continued a great part of the
d*y ; but the enemy was repulsed, and general
Hotze dill maintaining his pods ia front of the
entrenched camp, extending from the Recbach, by
the village of Maubach, to Franckenthal.

it appears that offaniive operations iu Italy have
been mod fuccefsuilly commenced.

General Alvinzy's report is dared at Fer
rÂ«, November 7. General Davidovith's at Trente,
the Bth inllant.
After the iecond operation, undertaken for the
relief ef Mantua, thvfc cÂ«rpÂ» of maiflial Wurmfer'â¢
army, which conW not per.c'rate, retired; âºheon" t
under general Quufdanowii.il to thu Venetian Fn <â 
oul; the other, under general Daviduvich, up thi
valley of the Adige, tuvra-ds Ncumarket.
These ccrp3 were fuccefsfully reinforced by coo- 1
fiderable numbei* of frefh troops ; arid general Al- =
vinzy was appoimed to command the whole ot the 1
army, until it (hould effed its re-uÂ«ion with tr.ai 1
fhalWurmfer. 1
After the rival of the reinforcements at the '
places of their destination, general Alvinzy, who -a
in person undertsken the conduct of the coips t
in the Frioul, arranged a plan of operations, of t
which the following is a sketch :
His corps was to advance through the Trevi- '
fane, towards Bafiano, aud, alter forcing the pas- f
sage of the Brenta, to proceed towards the Adiae, f
while general Davidovich (hould descend the valley 1
by which that river runs down from the mountains '
of the Tyrol, forcing the poiition'ef Trente, Ro- 1
veredÂ®, &c. \
"On the third of this month, upon the approach 1
of part ef general Alvinzy's advanced guard, the 1
enemy abandoned Caste Franco; and on the 4th
the Auftriar* corps advanced is two columns to the 3
Brenta ; the one to B\ffano, Â»f which they took '
possession, and jhe other of neatly 6 qual force, uri- v
lieutenant general Piovera, to Fotiteniva.
General Alvinzy halted on the sth inft. and r
spent that day in reconnoitering the position of 1
the enemy. He found the French army eticarnped c
in three lines in front of Vicenza.
On the 6lh, as General Alvinzy was on the I
point cfpufliing forward his advanced Buo- '
naparte, w/10 had marched in the night, commea 1
ced a mod severe attack upon his whole line. The '
action began with general Prover?.'< corps about 1
seven in the-morning, and very (bortly afterwards r
the enemy also advanced againtt Baflano.
General Alvinzy reports, that the enemy's at- '
tacks, tho made with the grcatelt impetuosity,
wereeDnltantly and completely repelled ; and that f
night put an end to the affair, without either par- *
tynav'ing gained or lolt any ground ; bat an indif- c
putable proof that the Auftrians having bad the 1
advantage in this adtion is, that when Qcneral Al- 1
vinzy next morning was preparing to renew it, he ]
found that/the enemy had completely retreated. 1
He reports, that they directed their march towards 1
Lifiera. '
Ge leral Provera's bridge over the Brenta hsv '
ing been deltroyed in the cosrfe of the morning of 1
the 6th, his column could not cross the river till 1
towards noon on the 7th, and general Alvinzy's 1
whole corps arrived late in the evening of that day '
at the camp of Caldo Ferro.
General Davidovich had the mean time driven '
back the corps oppol'ed to him, had made 1000 '
prisoners, and takea poflefliou of Trente, as was '
mentioned in his former report.
On the fame day that the above mentioned severe
action was fought on the Brenta, general Davido- '
vich attacked the enemyin the strong pass of Calia
no, a little to the northward vof Roveretlo. The
French had entrenched their position, and occupied,
in confiderable-forccy the Cattle of Beffono and La
Pietra, which, as 1 understand command the Palp.
The strength ofthe position was fnch, tbat not
withstanding his repeated efforts, general Davido
vich could not force it on the 6th ; but on the t
following day he renewed the attack.
The corps on the right of the Adige established
batteries 011 the heights of Nomi, which fired with |
considerable effedt; the troops on the left of the '
river attacked the castle and entrenchments with
perfeveting bravery, and the enemy were at length
completely defeated, with the loss of five camion,
eight ammunition waggons and 1000 prisoners.
General Davidovich supposes the enemy's loss, iii
killed and wounded, to have been considerable, and
states his own to have amounted Jo 400 men killed
wounded, and miffing.

had confidence in the spirit and loyalty of the em- | f

but at the fame time, he hinted that if, after a fair

came paffei.gers Ihe remnant of Americans laiciy
redeemed by their beloved country frÂ»m 4 long and
painful slavery in Algiers. They left Algiers the
13th July, at which time no vessel could be procu

they were obliged to embark with 48 Neapolitans
defiined for Leghorn ; but a few hours alter their
failing unhappily fsuntl one of the Neapolitans Uric
willi the Plague, we immediately according to Mr.
Barlow's orders returned to Algiers and landed
this man, and proceeded on our paflfage, the day
after another was found to have the
Plague, and on :he day following he died ; the day
after which Mr. Samuel E. Bayley of Newbury
port, was found to have the Plague and the day
following he died. Under those peculiar circum
fta;>ces it was unanimously agreed to proceed iÂ»
Marseilles, as the wind was contrary so â  Leghora,
where we arrived the 20t> July free from the plague
on board. Every precaution was taken to prevent
its further devaftatiori ; cleansing the ship contiim- >
al'y by burning fulpl u , tarred rope yarns, ana
washing the fliip and ouuclves with Viaegar were
the means of preventing its further progress, adding
to this, no other gerfw" was/tlfowed to have any

Sir,
THIS will fee presented to you by the remnant
of our capuvc citizens who have survived the pains
and humiliation of ilavery in this place ; af'er ef
fecting their deliverance, in the manner which I
state to you in my letter of this day, without funds,
or any diieA intelligence that they are Con to be
cxpeded, 1 have another task to perform, in which
it is impossible to promise myfclf success : it is to
embark them without the infection of the plague.â
rive of their fellow fufferers have died of that con
s tagion, within a few weeks; and another who is at
tacked iTiuft be leit behind. It rages with iuch vi
olence ilV"the town, that altho' trey cannot embark
, withput rilk, yet it is much more dangerous for
them to stay.longer here, in any fhuation where it
is pjffible for me to place them in this most â¢incom
modious of all conceiveable abodes. If they es
cape infection, we (hall be much indebted to the at
tention ot capt. Calder, who commands the (hip,
and to the careful afiiltanee, as well as to the har
mony and good understanding which prevail among
all the crew.
When we reflect on the extravagant sums of mo
ney that this redemption will colt the United States,
it affords at lead Tome confelation to know, tbat it
is not expended on worthless and disorderly
lons, as is the cafe with some other nations, who,
like us, are driven to humiliation to the Barbary
States. Our people have conduced themselves in
general, with a degree of patience and d ecortiro,
which would have become a better situation than
yhat of slaves ; and tho' after tl.ey arc landed in
their country, it would be useless to recommend
them to any additional favors from government, yet
1 hope they will receive from the merchants that
encouragement to t heir profeflional iÂ»dua r y, which
will enable them, 111 some measure, to repair their
; and from their fellow titizens in general,
that refpdtt which is due to the fufferings of he
neft men.
Sevsral of them are probably rendered incapable
of gaining their living ; one is in a state of total
blindness ; another is rendered nearly the fame
two or three carry the marks of unmerciful treat
ment in ruptuies, produced by hard labour ; and
others have had their canftitutions injured by the
plague. Some of them are doubtless objeÂ£ts of
the charity of their countrymen ; but whether
this charity should flow to them thio' the chan
nel of the federal government, is a question on
which it would be impertinent for me to offer an
opinion.

Our lately captive citizens ariivcd in the city yesterday
afternoon under an escort of fevind hundreds of their
iympathctic fellow-citizens, who had gone out to meet
them on the road to town. Upon their reaching the In
dian-Qujen, the crowd was so great as to render it diffi
cult for them to proceed; and on their entering the tavern,
an ardent acclamation fcxpreffed the general latisfaulion at
their happy extritation and fate return.
One captain and fourteen seamen of those released, en
tered on hoard ar. American ihip at Marfailles.
The condition of these unfortunate men, is the ex
treme of necefiity. Belonging to different parts of the
Union, and without any iibmediite means of fhbflllence.
It has been recommended by several reputable citizens to
open lu'oicriptionÂ» for their afliitance: the Banks have, in
general, agreed to teaeive donations. The foiallcft contri

I Sir, as members an- called upon far 0 fubflitute, and
) .to fpetify si of incikeit taxation as they judge
) proper for tilt purpose, 1 will take the l.berty to men
tion a fsw addition toVnany that were enumerated
by gendenian from South-Carolina, that appear to
me as objeils to embrace or to extend the duty
upofi. And fir.-., vi'ith regard to fuel) as bavÂ« not
yet beer; noticed by government; of this description
1 are all theatrical'exhibitioru,porter raanufafturcd with- '
in the United-States, clocks and watches. It will be
) obvious, at flrft view, that these are articles of conve- 1
nience or luxury, that are generally uled by those who
1 , are the,moft able to bear the burthen of government,
and may be used or omitted at pica/ure.âSir, with re- t
g*rd to theatrical exhibitions, we need only to turn
our eyes to the Urge and expenlive buildings occupied
for those purposes to canvinee us tWar the foiirces of
private revenue derived from their exhibitions must be
very extensive, and if so that they will fee a proper ob
je<fl to raise some public revenue from âWith regard
I to porter raanufaiSlured withia the United States, I .
think there may be some revenue derived rherefronl
with as much propriety as from spirits diflilled, and
the raanufadlurer might be protedled by an additional
dyty upon imported porter âWith regard to clocks and
watches, they are articles of convenience, chiefly used
by those who would not be diftrefled by a small tax,
and 1 am inclined to think, from the great number in
lift, that a considerable fym might be raifedfrcm thera
âWith regard to articles that will bear an extension | â 
of duty, I agree in opinion with the gentleman from | J
South-Carotuu, who gave us lo full a detail upon the 1
Ajlijecfl, as to the greater part of the imported articles, I
and should have been glad if he had included all kinds 1
of teas, i.nflead *â " confining his calculations to behea f
only, and also beer, ale and porter, among 'he class
of liquorsâWith regard to the finer teas, I am of -
opinion they will all bear an addition of dutv, from 1
this one consideration, that Â«c use them upon better
â¢trtns at present, under the duty they pay,'than we
formerly used the inferior kindsâWith regard to beer,
ale and porter, I would propose an additional tax, not
only to aid the revenue, but to protcfl the maiiufac-,
lure among ouri'clve6. Of the duty pad upc* these
articles, I expedl that foreigners would pay the great- -
er part as they generally give imported the preference
I am inclined to think that if the duty may be raised
upon imported, it may also be raised upon fpjrits ma
nufactured in the United States.
Sir, I would wish to make one or two observations
upon the ftatemtnt made by the gentleman from S.
C. who gave us a detail of the expenses and the proba
ble revenue of government. I find in this ftatcment
of the probable revenues from existing laws, under
the head of duties 011 impofls and tonnage, the amount
5ij28,961 dollars ccmputed as the annual net pro- '
ceeds. I find in the fiatcment made by the Secretary
ef the Ireafury, wherein'he exhibits a general view
of the amount of revenue upon impofU and tonnage
for the year 1795, the net proceeds to be calculated at |
7Â»959Â»4Â°9 70 dollars, making a difference ef 2,370,- 1
448 7* dollars. I find a lie in the report cf tfac Secre- 1
I: ' â¢
. ;
>
p tity of the Treasury, upon the system â  tlir?<" taxes,
the following obfervit on, viz. " iv hat the prodndl
of the prefeut year wiii be, cam r c yet nown ; al
though it is certain it *j'l cx ei, c nliderably,
I ! that of the year 1795." Tfe net proceeds of the
year 1795 being, as 1 be mentioned, 7,959,409 70
dollars, nd being informed by tl'e Secretary of the
'I reafury that iheamount of duties upon imp rts and
tonnage this year will with certainty consider bly ex
eJ ceed that sum. lamat a loss to determine upon what
principle the gentleman has foundef) his calculations of
u 5.588,96 dollars, for the true anÂ»ount of annual reve
,s nue, unlels he lh?uld have <ake it only from the ac
. tual receipts, whicli I suppose wÂ«uld' not be cervedl,
. because the diffrrence between the receipts of calh in
i the Treasury, ind the amount of d\Jties, wuft create
x a debt due the Treasury in the hands of somebody,
that must be paid, and will prave in aid of the reve"
1 make no doum but that the gentleman who '
1 |pveus the ftatemcnt from his knowledge ol the fub
jeift, and usual eorredlnei's, ran expUin the veafons of
, the difference. I would furiher observe that, under
the fame Head, the items relating to internal revenute
are stated at sums considerably below the amount of
the preient year. The Secretary of the Treasury in
t forms us that the produ(fi of the internal revenues for
the prelent year will "be considerably more than the
year past. I think the gentleman has omitted in\ hiÂ«
ftatcment one or two items that appear to me deferv
| in g Â°f some notice. I mean the probable amount of
, j fal<;s of land under the aCI of May last, and the debt
s j due frona J. C. Sjmmes and his associates. I think we
, I have a right with fume degree of certainty to calculate
upon some productive aid to our revenue from the sale
of public lands. I atn informed that with regard to
the debt ot Mr. Symmes, if the contracil is fulfilled
on the pairt of government agreeable to the report of
the Attorney-General, it will make'i considerable item
in the revenue account, according to my calculations,
there will be better than 400,000 dollars immediately
_j to be paid or placed upon interefiand paid in fix half
yearly instalments.
I Sir, the gentleman in the course of his remarks pro
â¢ posed the finail fÂ»m of 100,000 dollars to be raised by
diielt taxes. T his lum it is true does not at firft viewr
I appear at all alarming. But I have heard, upon for
| meroccafions, the idea of an entering wedge to a fy
, item suggested. This would operate as a complete one,
although finall yet the more dangerous ; to purfuc
the coniparifon, persons with wedges, having great
. force to overcome, make life of slim or small ones at
â  j fivft, as they are more easily introduced and soon niake
, j way for large ones. This I expect would be the efteft
Â» ! of the proposed fyftc rn and probably in time make way
( for the full accotnplifimient of the measure luggefted
by the member from Pennsylvania, which I before
itated to throw the.w'hoie burthen upon the farmer.
Sir, being my sentiments jl rntft vote agaifcit
the refoluticn now ofiered.
