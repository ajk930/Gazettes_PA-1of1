COMMUNICATIONS. â 
That man who pofTtlTes at this moment a greater
degree of affectionate, diflntereded veneration thaw
ever fell to the lot of a man before, has 'Â« unfolded
a talc' to his lillening country, and to the wprld,
which will by awakening American feelings, ren
der the mind, the public mind of Atnerica, alive to
the dignified sentiment of real independence. The
President, by a plain, unadorned narrative, has at
once difpla\ed the fair and honorable course that
the government has pursued towards France, and
the wavering, mterefled, boading conduit, princi
ples and language, which the French OionarÂ«bii>
and republicans have held towards this country. It
was doubtless an unpleasant task to perform ; but
to do it, wai rendered essential to a vindication of
the people, the congress and the executive, against
j the acts of a feduftion that could be dangerous to
us only while the people remained ignorant of cer
tain great fatls âand against those vain gWious
menaces which were to become coutemplibly harm
less the instant their injudice should be developed to
the Union. The character of the Americans was
not understoodâthe European politician indeed
might easily be misled by appearances hereâby the
total absence of those emblems of defence and of
t fence which cxift in Europe, in line of batrle fliips,
ready for service, and an imposing parade of drums,
, colours, and regimentalled soldiers. But there is
not a country gentleman in America who docs not
know that the present Jlation of this country is ex
tremely importantâand that were it forced into a
war at the present juncture, it could and would
carry an unimpaired and frefh vigour into its mili
tary achievements, that â¢would at leajl place all the
i/lands and territories on this fide the Atlantic at the
feet of the United States.
The conduct of the government proves its well
grounded attachment to This attachment
proceeds from the real sympathy that is preserved
between a growing, flourifhing and virtuous people,
. and the government;âfrom no ignorance of abund
ant resources; but an enlightened and honest wish
. to make a happy and virtuous use of them. All
Eutope vill mark the moderation that preferv'es us
in a (late of neutrality, at a moment when to place
ourselves in the scales of war would be Jec[five. It
is the sincere wish of every federal man in the go
vernment, to avoid hodilitiesâconvinced, as they
mud be, that the moment that the truth is told in
France, the directory will recall those orders, and
retract that fydem against neu'ral nations which is
so particularly offenfive to their dear allies.
A correspondent who was lately in the lobby of
the House of Reprefefltativcs of the United States,
when compensations were before the House, coald
not but remark with pleasure that many gentlemen
have ceased to imitate the French model of repuilican
ifm, in some thingsâeven in fomejhings where imi
tation to a degree would have had the air of origi.
nal eood sense. The French ref-aWicans give their
direÂ«ary-,âwno-nrc -certainly icpuuucatis, a fuperL
palace, the Luxembourg, as a residence, magnify
ccntly furnifhedâWhereas our patriots are for
making the officers of government rcfide without
any house at allâand for feeding them as though
they were preparing under the old Suttonian legi
men, for the small-pox. A by (lander, who is an
ingenious mechanic, fuggefled the idea of produ.
cing a fiame s shaped a good deal like a man, which
he said would do as a tejl coat for future dfficers
and would not admit any mau but one of those thin,
emaciated figures which it (truck him some gentle
men imagined as eflential to the qualification of a
secretary But on its being remarked, that thole
thin.-philosophical fellows, who (larve at table, al
ways took care to take a ravenous meal in theclofet,
he gave up the idea, and agreed that on the whole
it was impossible to make a tejl coatâappearances
were so exceedingly, deiujive.
The late precious confejions.of a certain colonel, a
eader in a Democratic club, proves no more than what
has for several years been imputed with truth to that
vile broodâTo these conspiratorsâ the uujuflifiable
condua ps the French in capturing American veflik,
ought to ke charged-as it appear, by that the
five kings of Club< chose rather to believe the Demo
crats than the Executive, as probably (from their de
crees) being more congenial with their principlesâ
Hear what the colonel lays himfelf, OH being a Iked tie
other evening what he thought of the condudl of the
rreach nowâhe answered he thought them perfectly
right, it was what wedelerved for making the Britilh .
â¢treaty t he then added HE had -wrote to them three
years ago to pursue their present plan. Every friend
to the United States will readily believe, this Demo
cratic (inner s confefiion, from its being so consonant
> their toasts, their ientiments and their writings in
all the Democratic gazettesâTreason with them is ho
crime, the truth of which is verifying daily* from their
awn hps, and with a front too, as hrafen as their
hearts, and like old rogues lie in the fame breath by
charging the government with plodding the evils we
now fuflfer from the French, while they acknowledge
they have wrote to them three years ago to commence
them. That period was before the treaty was made or
any measures taken that produced it.
NEW THEATRE.
On Monday evening the historical play of Colum
bus, or, A World Discovered, was presented to the .
molt numerous and brilliant audience ever witnefled in
this Cityâand great praise is certainly due to the ma
nagers tor the expensive magnificence with which the"
play is got upânor ought we to withhold the tribute
ot our acknowledgments for their liberal and dilinte
re a 0"""?'" reducing the price of the pit ticket,
on the fliil night ot a piece which attrafled and cannot
tail long to attrafl a crowded auditory.â The whole <
icenery is finely imagined, and its execution reflects the
higheit credit on the talents of Mr. Milbourneâbut
mthefceneof theflorm, the thunder and lightning,
temples tumbrng into ruin... with the volcano or burn
ing mountain appearing in the back ground -the gran
deur of ihe aftefling fpetfacle exceeds every thing we
have ever yet beheld, while its force was felt and ac
knowledged by every one present.
Of the performers it is difficult to speak without in
difcrimmate prarteâ I Thofe exquifitelv sweet and pa
hetic tones by which Mrs. Merry brought tears into
the eyes ot the whole audieacc, defy the powers of
panegyricâMr. Morton performed his part without
any diminution of his accustomed excellence, and ob
tained the plaudits he so well defervedâMr.Wignell,
Mr. Hsrwood and Mr. Franpis supported the comic
business of the play with an exertion of those talents
wiich seldom fail to set the theatre in a roar.âMr.
Cooper looked Columbus well, and the few lines he
had to deliver were given in a forcible and jmpreffive
manner. â Mcflrs. Warren, so* and L'Eftrange were
perfect in their several alotments and have a claim to
our commendationâMrs. Francis in her ailing did
great justice to the part of Neltyâbut her dress was
not appropriateâher own taste will furnifli the neces
sary alteration.
CONGRESS OF the UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF RIPRESESTATITES.
Wednesday, January I r.
Mr. Dwight Feller, from the committee of
claims, made report! on the petitions of John Bap
till Dumout and Michael Hillegas, which were
against the petitioners ; they were twice read and
concurred in by the House.
Mr. Swift, from the committee to whom was
referred that part of the President's speech relating
to the promotion of agriculture, made a report,
recommending the institution of a society for that
purpose under the patronage of government, which
might aft as a eomtron centre to all other societies
of a similar kind throughout the United States.
No public provision is contemplated, except for the
salary of a secretary and for dationary i but if [the
(late of the treasury should make even this unadvifa
ble, it is dated that it might be carried into effect
without pecuniary aid. The report is accompani
ed by a plan, the principle articles of which are,
that a society (hall be edablifhed at the feat of go
vernment ; that is (hall comprehend the legislature
of the United States, the judges, the secretary of
(late, the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of
war, the attorney general, and such other membets
as should chufe to become members agreeable to the
rules prescribed ; that an Annual meeting should be
held.at the feat of govÃrnment, at which is to be
chofcn the President, fectetary, &c and a board
to conGft of not more than thirty persons, which
(hall be called a " Board of Agriculture that the
society (hall be a body corporate ; , that a report
(hall be made annually, &c. The report conclud
ed in these words, " Resolved that a society for the
promotion us agriculture ought to be established at
the feat of government of the United States."
A bill was received from the senate for repealing
the limitation of the aft in additon to an aft for
the puiiihinent of certain crimes againtt the
Unite States, and to continue in force the fame.
It was twice read, and ordered to be committed
to a committee of the whole on Monday.
Mr. W. Smith gave notice that he (hould to
morrowcall up the report of fabe committee of ways
and means, on the fubjeft of providing further rev
enue.
Mr. Madifan called for the order of the day on
the bill for making provision for the claim of Mon
sieur Poirea, as secretary and aid-de'eamp to Major
General La Fayette. The house then took it up,
when.after some debate it was ordered to be engroff
for a third .read-morrows * Adiourned.
i hurfday, January 12.
T he house having resolved ilfclf into a commit
tee of ths whole on the report of the committee
of ways JMid means on the fubjeft of further reve
nue, Mr. Dent in thechair, and the following refa
ction being under confiderarion.
" Refolyed that there ought to be apportioned
according to the last census of the several states,
the lum of t 0 be raised bv the
following direst taxes, viz.
A tax ad valorem upon all lands, with their
imptovements, including town lots with the build
ings thereon.
" A tax on (laves with certain exceptions."
Mr. W. Smith said two quedions presented them
selves on this occasion ; the fird, whether any and
what further revenue was wanted, and secondly,
what means shall be used for raising it. With ref
peft to the fird, any gentleman who had taken a
view of aur engagements and revenue, would not
hesitate to fay a farther provision was neceflary. In
order to evince this, however, it might not be im
proper to .take a view of our public contracts and
revenue. They had before them, he fnid, the re
port of the secretary of the treasury on the fubjeft,
which not only contained a (late of our finances,
but of the revenue laws of the different dates, and
other valuable materials, necessary to be had in or
order to foim a fydem 0} direst taxation for the
whole Union. Mr. S. proposed, therefore, to'give
as brief an abftraft as pofiible of the date of our

I jority fbou'.d be in favor of direA taxation, the com
mittee would bring in such a bill as (hould appear to
them to be least bmrthenfome to the people. But, if
I gentlemen were of opinion rht money wanted i oald
be better raised in any other way, they would, of
course, prÂ®pofe their plans ; but he hoped tley should
r not fhift from one thing to another, without fixing on
any thing, since the wants of governmeat mult be
supplied.
Mr. Coit hoped the resolution would be adopt
-1 ed : not that he wished to pledge himfelf to agree
to any fyflem of dire& which might b*
1 proposed He looked upon the agreeing to the re
solution as only one rtep. Whether eventually such
a plan could be devised as the house approve
was tin eitain j bat he (hould wish to look at the
plan which gentlemen bad in contemplation.
Â« Mr. Harpei said, if they could look at the plari, as
the gentleman from Conneai-.-ut (Mr CÂ»if) had sup
posed, without pledging themselves to adopt a lyfttna
of direa taxation, he would also be glad to fee it ;
but, he believed, to adopt the resolution before them,
would be to decide upon the principle of direa taxa
tion. Afterwards, all the question would be as to the
modification of the system, and the manner in which
it should be carried Into effea. But, he believed, a
majority of that house, neither was, nor would be
prepared to fay this was the mod eligible and conveni
ent mode of raising revenue.
It was true that they all knew, they knew it last
session, that the money wanted mull be raised from the
people by means of taxatiÂ®n The queftioa was only
about the mode. The committee of ways and means
had given them a resolution of four lines, that direa
taxes ought to be laid ; but how, or under what mo
dification, or how the difficulties which were acknow
ledged to exifi, were to be got over, they were not
told ; but 'hey were called upon to determine upon
thp principle, without any information on the fubjea
He wished the committee of ways and means might be
inflruaed to give them the data upon which they
meant to found their plan; that they might be in
ftruaed to shew the'm the means by which this plan
was to be effeaed. They eloubtlefs had considered
tins; but tne committee of the whole had not consi
dered it; nor had they the matKrials for going into the
mveftigation. It w*s his desire. that before they com
mitted themselves, that they might know more about
the matter than they then knew ; that they should
have the system before them, and-that they might not
decide upon the abltraa principle, without having
that system He should, therefore, be againfl the re
solution, and move for the committee to rife, that the
report might be re-corumitted, for the purpose of ob
taining a sketch of the plan which had been contem
plated. ,
Mr. Swtnwick hoped the committee would not
rife, until they had determined upon a question
wlii< h was of the firll importance to this country ;
a question which it had been well for us if it had
been intioduced'long ago, but which, he trulled
was not now too late to be of cflVntial service. At
present, he said, produce was falling, and <jf course,
any tax upon the farmer would not be so well re
ceived as if their produce was upon the rife ; but,
he trulted, the wealth of the country mull have be
come so considerable, from the high price which
every agricultural production had long been at, as
to enable them very well to support the necessary ex
pences of government. Theft expences, they
knew, mud be supplied from one of three fourccs ;
either from loans which have heretofore been made
in Europe, at great expence of agency, brokerage,
coramiffion, &e. or from impofl, erbyinteinal re
venue,' or excise.
Into what situation, he asked, had this loan-ma
king business brought this country ? They have
created, what seemed to be wished on all hands to
be avoided, a foreign influence over thu country.
It had made us dependent upon what i: was not in
otir power ; upon every accident which
might happen at Amlterdam or Antwerp. So far
as related to imports, this fouice of revenue wasex
pofed to the influence of war, and absolutely de
pendent upon any foreign government which might
please to annoy us. Was this, he aflced, an envia
ole situation ? He thought not. This dependance
upon f'6reign nations, was a great difadvautage in
ali negociations. %
With refpeft to excise, he need not fay how un
pto luctive it had been. Tjie article of fnuff, in
stead of producing any thing, had brautjht the
revenue in debt ; and the excise on another article,
had called forth the military to enforce it. For his
part, he saw no way of avoiding these difficulties,
but to come to that cardinal point, which they had
in view, of direst taxation He (hould, there
fore, be hi favour of the resolution before them, be
cause it fixed the principle.
It was necessary, Mr. S, said, to the importance
and firmnefs of Government, to determine whe
ther the land of the country be not equal to bear
its share in the expences of Government. This tad
hitherto been evaded ; but he trulled this mass of
! property would no Lnger escape from paying its
1 due proportion towards the public burthens. For
when it was known in foreigr? countries, that all
our revenue was bottomed upon our commerce, it i
was holding out an invitation to them to piay'off!
hollilities upon us. Great Britain, be said, had ta- i
; ken the lead in annoying our trade, which had
brought us to the Britilh treaty. We- were row '
brought into another situation by that inflrument â¢
the French were now laying hold of our cotamerce!
It was said that Great Britain drew very little
support trom her land, in comparifan to what she
drew from her commerce ; but she had a fleet to
defend her commerce, and therefore, if she drew
a great deal from it, she was also at some expense
in ftipporting it. Our trade, he laid, was unpro
tected. It was true, we obtained seven millions of
dollars from it, without being at any ,expense in
return. But, he said, there was no certainty of
this ; aud without some plan like the present, there
would be no security for supporting the expenses of
our government; nor could aijy negotiation ever be
properly supported, until the yeomanry of our coun
try should join in the support of our common inter
ell. It was absolutely neceflary, Mr. S. said, to
decide upon one of two principles, either to support
commrr. e by a navy and thereby secure the re
venue arising from it, or Â«!fe call upon agricul
ture to bear its lull (hare *of the public burthens.
âHe therefore wilhed the principle to be fettled with
out regard to modification, because the more fun pie
the in which the objea was placed the better,
i'he modification would probacy be an Â»fter business â 
asd, when members had agreed upon the neceflity of
adopting the principle of a direa tax, thtiropp c fiti cn
â¢ to any particular pLjis wlncti might fee offered would
>be moderated, to tbe best fyiteni which coul.l be
devised wÂ«uki probably be adopted.

Communication.
It was at fit ft imagined that the Agents of the
French Directory in the Well-lndiea were ifluing
and executing ordeis for capturing and condemning
American veflels, without authority from the Di
rectory : but this is probably a mittake. Their a
gents in Spain are doing the fame thing there. It
is also a fa& that the captures by French armed
veflels are not confined to Americans, several
Swedilh and JDanifh veflels have been already
captured and earrird into Spanilh Forts in Eu-'
rope, and an this principle, that they were go
ing to or from ports of the enemies of France ;
and on this prim iple the French coiifnl at Cadiz
avowed his determination to condemn all neutral
veflelsâfaying he had authority so tc do.

Porcupine's Gazette.
Proposals by WILLtAM COBBET r, ippofite Christ
Church, Philadelphia, for pubiiihingi news-paper,
to be entitled
Porcupine's S5 5 Daily idvertifer.
Me tin aks I hear the reader exclaim What i have
we not Gazettes enpugh already ?" Is, and far tÂ«o
many : but those that we havi, are, 1 general, con
duced in such a manner that their grit number, in-
Head of rendering Kline unneteiary, ithe only caufc
that calls for its eftabiilhmcij:. f
The gazettes in tliis country-have dofitmerc real in
jury tuan all its open caeiines ever iti<?r can do. They
mislead the peopie at home aod mi'prelmu them a
broad. It was these vehicles of ftf'on and discord
that entouraged the comities m tht eit to rebel ; it
was they that gave rife to the deprftion of Britain,
by exciting the people to such aits violence against
that nation, as left no room to dot that we were.de
termiaed on war; aa>l it was thf when an accom
modation had been happily ilirred up an
opposition to it such as has witnefTed, and
whioh was overcome by mirechai- These gazettes
it was, that, by reifreprefenting fdifpohtions of the
people, encouraged the French (proceed from one
degree of insolence to another, 'at lift their Minis
ter braves the Prefidont in bis*'*', and a bullying
commander comes and tells us tlhâ Â« only bufmefs is
to seize our veUels, in violatior a treaty, in virtue
ot whiok alone he claims a right-'Uter our ports : and
it Is these gazettes thjt now have impudence to de
fend what their falfehood aad rr"e have produced.
1 fball be told that the peci *re to Mane; that
they are not obliged to read tbabÂ®f*inab!c pablica- I
tions. But they do read the an d thousands whÂ«
read thctn, read nothing else. iupprefs them it iro
poflible ; they will vomit fortfe :r poison ; it is a pri
vilege of their natures, that W ear. abridge; and
therefore the only mode left 11 Counteract its ciTcifls.
This muS be done, too, iwrsimway. Books,
or periodical publications in form of books, may
be of some service, but are h> means a match for
their flying folios. A. falie-brffcat retv.aini uncomra
di&ed for a month, begins tooeked upon as a truth,
and when the dete&ioa at laakes its appearance* it
is often as nfelefs as that el dodlor who finds his
t patient expired. The only jod of opposition, then,
is to meet them on their o /OKiid ; to set foot to
loot ; difpnte every loch f every hair's breadth;
I fight them at their -own wes, and return them two
blows tor one
. A gazette of this ftarap iat I have long wifiled to
