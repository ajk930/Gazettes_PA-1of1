From tie MAir 1 Ann JcvkSAl.
ONE of the jrreatefl evils to <*?hich republics
have been exposed, iÂ« instability of councils a fluc
tuation of lawÂ» and schemes-os policy produced by
the change of parties and faflions. ThiÂ» result may â¢
be properly called a government of men, rather than.
oflawi. In this country and under the conftitu'i-,
on of the United States, it will be by no means a
difficult thing to avoid this evil, if the people have
discernment to comprehend the true principles of
the government, and virtue enough to endure them
in prailice. They will (hew in their eledlions, whe
ther they this penetration and firmnefs. If
;thry elect men who lire fiiendly to systems fonnded
in'the true spirit of the con litution jif they tcjf&
candidates who are opposed to good mcafures which
have been adop'ed, and thi; fuccefiof which and of
others connedled with them, depends upun (lability,
and perseverance j if they have fagatityUo com
prehend the system into which public affairs inter
nal and external have been arranged, and wisdom
1) enough to give that fyltem a $ if
they have confidence ia the great ana enlightened
man who retires full of glory from chair of
Â»" state, they will name a fucceflor who will pursue the
thread of his views, give continuity to his fyllem,
V and carry into pra&iee those inestimable political
'' precepts which he has fanflioned at his parting id
jj vice to his grateful country. Who among does
not glow in reading that address from the Prelidentv
in which he has so affectionately developedthe iotind
ptinciples that have governed his public conductâ
who among us who does not acknawledgie the pro
foundnels of his maxims, the simplicity of his fyf
tem of general federal policy, the wisdom of his
advice !âln the choice of the eleA'ort of his fuc
cefTor, we qughtconftantly to keep in view a succes
sor who is attached to the constitution and the mea
sures Â«f the Picfident ; and who will carry into
pra&ice that system which our beloved Wa(hingtoa
has adopted and recommended to his,fellow-citi- a
zens. This will be fotne consolation for our loss ; '
and thus will the spirit of that great man still pre- I
e fide throngh the action of his principles, over the t
affairs from wliich he retires. The bleffug which. I
* heaven confers occasionally upon nations, n giving I
e them men of uncommon wisdom and virtue, would '
be in a measure defeated, were the influence f
of such men toceafe with their retirement or their c
* death. The life of man is short. The duration c
e of wisdom may be made for ages to futvive him r
c who gives its precepts Â» current weight in a nation, c
This is the immorality that ;s uuc to such a man as a
n Washington. This would truly be to continue him *
amang us for ages. f
Of the names brought into view as his successor f
the vice-president, Mr. Adams, appears most likely i
to meet withthe approbation of the federal men, in f
the union ; and it may, from hiecbaraflii,i>e fair- I
Ij ly presumed that he will be proud to tread in the f
â fleps of the President, and deserve the elevated fta- a
a tion intended him. That Mr. Adams should have r
been the man of the federal men, is not at all an t
unexpe&ed thing. To have been the fecend man t
in the choice of the nation, ever llnce the adept!- 1
- on of our excellent conÃitution must at once have t
prepared both him and the nation for a higtiergrade s
in his favour, whenever the President should de- i
e cline. To overlook hivn in such a juufhire, would J
be a puerile inconsistency, nnjuft to him and unwor- 1
t thy of the people. What so natural, Â»s that hav- 1
, ing lorg diftingtiilhed him next to their firtl, when :
that firft retires, to make him firft. A firm eti- >
- lightened and try'd friend and defender of the re- c
publican representative government, as balanced in c
our conltitution, the union will- uave in him, th* a
friend of liberty and law, asfecured under our pre- i
sent unrivalled political foim. They will "have in 1
him, that fame zeal for the real independence of his' (
country which rendered him so cor.fptcuous during t
our glorious revolution j and that attachment to 3
our constitution which has prrfcrved the noil un- (
r d iminifhed sympathy between him and the Prefi- t
dent, in all the concuflions of public opinion, since r
the adoption of the federal government..
As a foreign minifler, his character stone with f
splendor upon two impoitant and memorable occa- 1
fior.s: the Dutch negociition and the treaty of c
pease with Great-Britain. In the firtt he was o- v
bilged to call forth all his address. . Those who are 1
at all read in the political affairs of the seven Unit- t
ed Provinces, know that the federate form of go- b
vernment which was then in force, was perhaps the t
mod complicated, and flow in farming its it\s, of t
any power in Europe. To take Holland, the most i
important of the seven, as an inflanceâln this d
province there are eighteen cities, which were to c
I many purposes sovereign bodies. Each sent its e
deputies or Hates to the states of the province. The v
. sovereign power of the republic was in the Rates Â«- e
, Â«Â«77/, vhich confided of the deputies or states sent 1

our jacobin news papers, either from flupidity orl
at corruption already exuli that the neutral dates from! g:
the Baltic quite to the Adicatic, have been compcld jj
u Â® ' by the French to shut their ports against the En
Â°" glifh, if they fhoald not meet with checks they wilt*
do the like in America. Already they juftify .the
'Â»â¢ faithlefs and wicked project of pteying upon thet 5
'' n commerce of Amsrica with England. The eyes
ia- 0 f (bis country are not so blind, nor is it s spirit so
deband, as to acqniefce, much less to rejoice in this
or ' ufurpatien of our independent sovereignty, this vi- c(
,r - olatiori of uÂ»t neutiality, this faithlefs and fhsme
lefs breach of a solemn treaty ? If the jacobins! 0
have a spark of eiNier feofe ar patriotism, they willl
fee, and will at last confefs, that French fucceffesjp
are no longer to be celebrated. When France bc-l
comes master of all Etirope, America will not beJ f,
on mistress even of her o'wn seas. Our ships must rot
re- in port, or fail only where France will permit. Is j
is this independence ? Fallen jacobins do you wish all ,)
to power to France, so that the United States shall lie p
ng at her mercy. Degenerate, poor spirited wretches, g
lif- j>o to France, and while you renounce your own
jc- country, adore ycur own kind of liberty al the fooÂ« j
