CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. |
1
, Wednesday, May 13.
(Concluded from our lafl.)
Mr. Sitg it eaves said, if he nnderftood
the realon alfigned in favour of this motion
(and it was the only reason which he had
heard) it was, that it would be improper to
aÂ£l in the way proposed, whilst our million
in France (hell be pendingand undetermined.
He tinderftobd gentlemen to insinuate a belief
that whilst this million remained undetermin
ed, it would be an outrage on the laws and
usages of nations, to adopt the resolutions
which he had proposed to the house.
On this subjeCt, Mr. S. believed, there
could be no fort of question. It is a principle
as well fettled as any In the law of nations,
that when a nation has received aggreflions
from another nation, it is competent for the
injured country, to pursue its remedy by re
prisal before a declaration of war takes place,
and these reprisals (hall be perfectly warranta
ble, whilst they are commensurate only with
the injuries received, and are not under such
circumstances juftifiable cause of war. It is
even clear that these reprisals maybe made
during the pendency ot a negociation, and can
not, according to the law of nations, be a juf
tifiable ground for the rupture of any such
negociation.
He belifcved, therefore, that upon this sub
ject, there could be no doybt as to the right
of adopting these refolntiGns. For let it be
remembered, said he, they are not calculated
to authorize general letters of marque or repri
sal, which would induce iridifcrimi'nate at
tack on all vefiels belonging to the French
Repnblic, wherever found. The right of
capture is proposed to be litniteil to cruizers
of the French Republic; who liwy be found
on our coast, or in cases where they may have j
afhially attacked veftelsof the United States I
for the purpose of search or feizure âmenfures 1
of ftrifl defence which are ellbntial to the
prcfent situation of the country, and by no i
means 6f%n offenfive nature ; it is not a course
of general reprisal, but of fptcial reprifn! an- i
thorized by the law of nations, which does |
not amount to a cause of war, 110'r of the rup- !
tureof any ncggciatioii now pending. He 1
felt confident, therefore, that on the ground j
of drift right, no objection could be made to
this nreafure, and he did not expetl to have
met with any difficulties of this kind. 011 1
the question of expediency, gentlemen may
differ; but he did not fulpett they could have
differed on the question ot right. As to the
question of expediency, he would a(k his
friend tram Kentucky, what he had seen in
the experience of the past, or in the present
situation of this country and France, to in
duce him for a moment to wifli a poftpone
inent of the question ? Is there any thing,
said he, in all our experience with the French
Republic, since the commencement of our
dispute, which can lead its to hope that we
(hall gain any thing by forbearance, by fub
million, and acquiescence in jrtl-the injuries
we arc daily receiving from her ? Certainly
not. We have been practicing this system of
forbearance from the earliest period of her
aggreflions until the present. Nothing else
has been heard, and what has it produved but
accumulated injury ? Has this l'pirit of for
bearance done any good ? Has it produced
the repeal of a finglq decree, or a relaxationin
its execution f On the contrary, so far as
appearances will warrant an opinion, we have
some reason to believe, that a spirit which
(hould (hew an intention to refill repeated in
sult and injury, is the only kind of spirit which
could produce any good effett in France.
He would not express an opinion on the
authenticity of the late accounts from Europe,
which represent our Envoys to have been re
ceived, and to,have had several conferences
on the fubjett of their million with the Minil
ter for Foreign Affairs ; but if they are enti
tled to any belief, they provedemonftrably to
his mind, that the French nation is not wil
lirig to drive this country to extremities ; but
that they desire by any means to protract our
present state ot fufpence, and to avert that
decision which itul necelTarily result from an
absolute rupture of the negociation. On ac
count of the spirit of forbearance which has
been (hewn by this country, the French have
been enconraged to make the most unjnlt and
extravagant demands of our Commimoners,
but they have refilled these demands with be
coming spirit. They have said, it thtffe de
mands were persisted in, they would demand
purports and return home. What has been
the consequence f IflÃie reports now in
circulation are true, they prove that the
French have not been willing to grant them
palfports, but, rather than drive us into ex
tremities, to relax from their demands, and
if our million exists at all, it mult ba on a dif
ferent bafts from that on which it heretofore
relied. It will be proper, therefore, to give
up that spirit of forbearance which has hither
to characterized our and psofe
cute by all the ways permitted by the laws ot
Nations, measures of defence both by sea and
land.
If had been said, that the proposed delay
could do no injury. He believed it might j
and he was fureit could do no good. Thede
lay of a few days would not be likely topro
| duce any more favourable accounts from
France, nor to afford evidence of that'ftate of
things which would enable us to act with de
cision ; fuc'n as a declaration of war, or the
departure of our Envoys from France.
It was said, the public armed force would
not be ready to put to sea before the time to
which this question is proposed to be postpo
ned; but these relolutions relate to private
aimed veflels, as well as public veflels. And
if it be admitted that the public armed ships,
may, in the course of two or three weeks, be
equipped for sea, it is not to be expeiled, ac
cording .to the ulual difctiflion given to impor
tant bills, that if the resolutions were now
referred, the bill would be palled before the
ill (fruitions are wanted ; and if the question
(hould be postponed as proposed, the veflels
would have to wait for instructions two or
three weeks after they arc ready to fail. One
of these veflels is indeed now waiting only for
inltniCtions. And he alked what instructions
the President could give under our present
circinnltances, until farther authority was
veiled id him by Congress ? If he employed
themas convoys, our coast. would be left un
protected. And if they remained on the coalls,
w hat could they do f They cannot attack a
French cruizer, or drive a picaroon away.
They could only refill attacks made on the
velTels of the United States. A French crui
zer might even fail in company with our arm
ed veflels, and if an American merchant Ihip
should heave in fight, might leek his oppor
tunity to capture her, when beyond the imme
diate protection of our armed and they
could not have the power to re-take the prize
thus taken, aim oil within their view. They
could afford no protection to any veflel> ex
cept (he was attacked in their presence. But
if our armed vefTels received the inftruÂ£tiohs
which he proposed to give them, the French
cruizcrs would be afraid of being I'efcn by
them, and two or three ships like the Ganges,
would scour the coast of nine tenths of the
Privateers which now infett it. But if they
thuft go out without these inilni&ions, all that
the picaroons arid cruizers would have to do,
would be to take care not to attack ahy ves
sel in their view. He believed tkis was not a
(fate of things to which this country ought to
submit, or to wl>ich (lie would ftibmit ; for.
whatever may be the reluctance (hewn in this
house to go into this measure, there is no fitch
reluctance in the great mass of the American
people. He was persuaded they impatiently
expect Government to defend the honour
and protect the property of the country. Their
wishes a:id determinations far outstrip ail that
Congress proyofe to do. He believed a divi
fio'n such as is in this house, could not be
found in any part of the Union- He did not
believe that a meeting of the fame number of
persons could be called together in any part
of the United States, from New Hampfliire to
Georgia, where such a diviliyn as is found in
this house could take place. He believed the
addrelTcs which had been received from all
parts of the Union inconteftibly prove this
faifl. The people are tired of the injuries
which have been heaped upon us, and are
impatient to prevent a repetition of them, and
so far as it can be done confidently with the
Law of Nations, it has become a solemn duty
to do it.
It ought to be the pride of America, that
fhehas confined all her meaftires of defence to
the established rules of the Law of Nations,
and he wiflied to continue to govern our con
duct bv the fame rule, and therefore infleud
ot making a Declaration of War, about which
gentlemen make such a rout, or of authori
sing General Rcprifals agaihft France, which
would have been imprudent Wniltt our Com
miflioners are in Paris, fpecific reprisals au
thorised by the Law of Nations, are only pro
-1 posed to be pursued ; a regulation which he
believed was loudly called for by the fituati
j on of the country, but which was very differ
: ent from General Reprisals, or a Dv-claration
of War. For himfelf, however, he had no
j hesitation to fay, that he regretted that there
i were any circumrtances in our situation which
j obliged its to confine ourmeafures to the fpe
. cific reprisals proposed, if it were known ei
ther that our Envoys had left the territory ot
France,or were retained in that country against
their will, or if it could in anyway be afcer
i tained that the mifiton was at an end ; he gave
; it as tys opinion, that the honour, dignity and
; interest of this country, require that we
j lhould make, war upon the French Republic,
i and he believed it wouk| be the duty of Con
! grefs to declare it.
Mr. S. concluded by obfervingthat all the
obje6tÂ».*ns which had been made, and which
he had encountered, did not ftriflly apply to
the Qjaeftion before the House ; which was
on the reference of these Resolutions toa com
mittee and not on their adoptionâAs he had
moved the resolutions it could not be doubted
that for himfelf he was ready to pass upon
them immediatelyâBut as he did not defirc
to hasten the adoption of any important mea
sure, ivithoutprapcrand n:*.ure deliberation ; j
lie had confined himfelf to bringing the sub- ;
jeel before the house, and to moving that the ;
refolii ftiotild go to the Committee on the
protection of commerce and the defence of the
country, to upon by them, by bill
or otjierwife.
Ms. Ven a b obfqrved, that it was a little
extraordinary that the mjiver of these resolu
tions fliould insist upon their being conforma
ble to the Laws of Nations, and that lie (liquid
at the fame time allow that the President of
the United States cannot give these inltruc
tions, except authorised by law to do so,
though it must be alloyved he a right to
give whatever inlirudhons are authoriled by
ihe Lawsot Nations. Mr. V. recollected that
when the subjeCt of ptoviding these veflels
was un'der debate, it was objected against
them, that their ufcfulnefs would be very
limited, except we got into war; but that
gentleman and other*, at that time, said they
could do many things, and be of great service,
though he now confclfes they can be of no
use, without the which lie propo
ses to be given to them. But the fame law
which would authorize these veflels to act in
the way proposed, would involve the country
in war, for it goes to authorise our public and
private armed veflels toattack any armed ves
sel which (hal! attempt to search any of our
merchant veflels, though they are authorised
to do so by the Laws of Nations, so that such
a power is neither more nor less than war.
And Mr. V. alked if the power proposed to
be given to public and private armed veflels
to retake any of our veflels which have been
captured, be conformable to the Lawsot Na
tions ? It is not, but directly contrary. And
the power to take aud deflroy all armed French
cruizers which may be found on the coall,
though veflels of all Nations have a right not
only to come upon our coast, but into our
ports and harbours, is certainly an aCt of war.
Gentlemen have pretended, from time to
time, to fay, they were not ready to make
war, but the gentleman la(t up declares he is
ready. If we are 'o have war, he wiflied
members might no longer amuse themselves
with the hopes of peace. He wished the peo
ple of the United States to be undeceived in
this re(peÂ£t. Every flep which had been ,
proposed for some time part, had progrefled
towards this event ; and this measure seems
to put it out of all doubt. He wished, there
fore, it might be considered as a war mea
sure.
The gentleman last tip had spoken very de
cidedly ns to the sentiments of the people of
the United States. He might hare, Mr. V.
said, better information on this subjeCt than
he had, but he believed the people were as
much divided as the members of this house,
on the subjeCt of war.
If gentlemen areNletcrmincd to go to war
at all events, he wiflied it to be so understood,
that Congress might go info me'afc.res calcu
lated to meet such a (fate. Because we have
a single Ihip-ready to f-ij, the gentleman
seems to think we .ire ready to no to war. As
if a veil'cl or two would able cover our
\_VCLUMÂ£ XIJI.
whole coal?, and to cut up all the armed force
which might come againlt us. If every mem
ber in the house co.uld be got to vote for these
resolutions, it would, in his opinion, be very
improper to pass them at pre feat, as the do
ing so would lay the whole, of our commerce
prortrate. Our coasting trade is as yet un
touched, yet gentlemen are willing to cxpofe
the whole, though they have only one (hip
ready to proteC? it. He hoped the propoled
postponement would take place.
Mr. R. W i lliams said, it was on all hands
acknowledged, when the fubjejet of the naval
armament was under consideration, that the
President had power to empjoy them in any
manner authorized by thelaws of nations. So
that it the directions proposed by the gentle
man from Pennsylvania for the commanders
of our veflels be within the law of nations,
the President has power to give them, without
any law being palled for the purpose. Hut he
conceived these resolutions to go much far
ther than is warranted by the laws of nations j
he tonlidered them as nothing (bort of a de
claration of war.
The gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr.
Harper) has told the committee that the fitu
,ation of this country is by no means doubt
ful, and told them what he is wUling.to do.
But if gentlemen are ready to declare war,
why do they propose measures which they fay
only go half way. If a proportion for war /
was made in a direct manner, every member
could then underUaod it.. But he was in
clined to doubt the correctness.of the opinion
cf the gentleman from S. Carolina as to the
state of ;liÂ£ country, as he had told the houlc
the fame thing lall spring, when he was as
prepared, as he seems now tp be, to plunge the
country in war. He was himfelf then, as he
continued to be, oppofecj to any mea lures
which fliould produce war, until war was un
avoidable ; and he believed few per'ons
would be found to Jay that the country had
not been in a much happier situation (for pro
duce never fold higher than it had done for
the last year) than if we had been in war.
Our revenue having increased, and things in
general gone vi eil.
But it was said, that our commiflioners were
evidently of opinion that nothing could be
done V>y way of negociation. He himfelf
thought the dilpatches would convey no such
idea. On the 31ft of January, our commifli
oners presented a memorial to the French go
vernment, and proposed to wait a reasonable
time for ananfwer, which, if they did not re
ceive, they proposed to apply for paeons to
come away ; and as by late Recounts, we find
they still remain at Paris, it is rational to fup
pol'e, they have some hope of the negociati
ons having a favorable iflue. For it could
not be supposed they would be so regardlefo
to the interest of the country, as to remain
longer there than they entertained hopes of
being of service.
But it was frequently after ted, that France
has made made enormous and'difgraceful de
mands upon this country. Whatever the
demands were which certain persons made
upon our commiflioners, we know they were
not made in an authorized manner, nor do we
know that the government was at all acquaint
ed with the tranfadtion. We know that they
were made by unofficial charatfers, and the
lad we heard from our conrmiffioners was,that
they would not listen to them any more. It
appeared to him, that at this time, as we do
not know the situation of the negociation, it
would be extremely impolitic to enter into a
inealure lÂ»ke the present. He wilhed 4've de
cilion upon this resolution to be postponed,
until we heard something more from France.
; He believed with the gentleman from Penn
j fylvania that there was no great division in
i the country on the queition of a peace or war ;
Â« but he differed from him wholly as to the de
sires of the people on this fubjeCt. He be
lieved they very generally deiire peace, and
not mar. And he believed this was clear
fiom the addre.Tes to which the gentleman
referred ; tor though they approve of the
Conduct oi' the Frefident, what is it for f For
endeavouring to preserve peace with the
French republic, And tliey gen,-rally contain
exprclfions deprecating the horrors of war.
Belides, if these resolutions were proper
now, why were they not Itfaiiglit fÂ«rw.ti.Â« im
mediately after the late, dilpatches tterfc re
ceived ? Why were they driven till this time ;
and when reports are in circulation that our
envoys are in the way of accomplilliing their
Object, they are brought forward ? It leemed
a3 i! gentlemen were apprshenfive that some
thing thou Id be agreed upon, and they were
determined to fruitrate any iettle-.uent which
might be or. foot.
The matter ot right to do what was propo
led could not be disputed. He believe ! we
had not only been fufficiently injured by
France, but by another nation, to warrant a
ny meufure which policy might diflate. The
queition of expediency was the thing to be
conlidered ; and as he could not yet give u|*
the hope of an accommodation, he was deci
dedly in favour of the postponement.
Mr. \fy\ concluded, by requeftij>Â£ gentle
men to consider whether, if by a Measure of
this kind the million now in France, which
would otherwise have been {iiccefsful, and
prefervad the country in peace, should be
broken off, and produce a war, how they
could reconcile their conduct to their confti
tnents,' If he were to vote for such a mea
sure, he could not do it. Were he convinc
ed no liope remained of the negotiations fiic
ceeding, and that the French were determin
ed on war, a nieaiurd of this kind, ormuclt
llronger, would be gone into without any di
vilion. When no hope of preserving .peace
remained, there would be but one voice in
that house ; but so long as that hope remain
ed, it might be expected that thole who are
anxious to preserve that Itate of things for
their country, would oppose every meafurj,
whose object and tendency is war.
Mr. Gallatin observed, the queition
was not now whether it Would be proper toa
dopt these resolutions, or not, but whether,
under our present circumltanccs,'they contain
principles which form at present a proper fu'.>-
jeil matter of dilcu'.lion. The gentleman
who moved the postponement, Itated, -fiat so
long as Our negotiation in France was not con
cluded, the difcuflion wits improper. His
colleague (Mr. Sitgreaves) on the other hand,
had infilled upon the right we had to pals
these resolutions} that they are continent
with the law of nations to i:e atfouted in a
ot peace, and would not therefore, pro
duce a rupture in negociation.
The firlt pofitioa as to our right, Mr. G.
said, lie should not deny ; but when his cot-,
league fays, rffol.itions like these are coiililt
ent with a Itate ot* and not tanfanmuatâ¢ to Â« ir, that they are special letters of marque
a:>d reprisal, authorized by tlie laws of nati
nnS, his ideas are unfoended. The resolutiâ
ons upon the table have 110'hing to do with
letters of marque. It is true, they are not a
declaration of war ; but they go'to the mak
ing of partial war. Was it ever heard that j
Ict ers of marque were given to public vef-
Tels ? They arc given to private vessels alone:
fpecific letters of marque are sometimes given
in time of peace to an individual, in order to
indemnify him for a fpecific injury. But ge
neral letters of marque and reprifalliave not â 
for a century been granted except in a (late of
declared or aflual war. But these resolutions I
toe neither general nor fpecific letters of '
marque. They are inflruflions to our pub
lic veflelsto make war. They do not fay to
the commanders of our vessels, " you shall
make war in all cases," but they authorize
Certain acts ot war. His idea of these resolu
tions, was, therefore, that they are inftrudlions
to make a partial war ; and when one nation
makes partial war upon another, nobody
could doubt hut it was war.
Mr. G. said, he would not speak of these
resolutions as leading to war; for though
they are not a Declaration of War, they are
tantamount to it. It might be proper for us
to make a kind of partial war, in preference
to a gene al war, in order to throw the blame
bf declaring war upon our Enemy. He did
not object to the resolutions, therefore, be
cause they make a partial, instead of a gene
ral war; but because they are inconsistent at
present with the (late of peace in which it is
infilled we (fill continue, and with the negoci
ations which are not yet finally terminated.
What reasons, said 'vlr. G. are given for
entering into th?fe refolations at this time!
Either that France is m iking war against us,
or that no hopes remain of our negociation
terminating favourably.
France is certainly doing, and had long done
aits, which would authorize us in making
war upon her. The gentleman from S. Ca
rolina (ays (he takes our vessels under every
poflible circumstance, and so on. Mr. G.
said he did not mean to dispute any thing
which he had said in this refpefl. He was
willing to grant, besaufe it was not material
in the present discussion, thit France has tak
en all our vessels wherever she could find
them. Hut he would a(k, whether, after the
di. patches of our Commissioners, the house
did not determine to take a certain (land, and
to adopt certain mtafures i What were they f
They were to make defenlive preparations by
land; to finilh and equip forfea our three fri
gates ; to provide twelve vessels and a num
ber of gallies for the protection of our com
merce and coast, to be employed according
to the discretion of the President. It was
then said, he might use them in conformity
to the fituatlon of our country. He did not
mean to dispute that position. He would al
so take it for granted, that the Prelident had
a right to emplsy these vessels for the pro
tection of our trade on the coast, arid as con
voys. He was himfelf opposed to their being
used as convoys in time of peace. His opi
nion was, that armed vefl'els could be of little
uses as convoys to ourvelfels intime of peace;
but to employ these vefTels effectually, would
be tofcoUrthe coast of the p.-ivateersand pic
caroehs which infill it. He concurred in opi
nion with gentlemen that this was the only ef
fectual way in which our vessels could be
employed ; but tlie house then conceived
that thus to employ them would be to make
war, and therefore they were left to be em
ployed by the Pretident according to the
of the country at the time. '
Mr. G. wifÃedto know what change had
taken place in the (itvt.ition of the country
(ince the period at which the dispatches were
coi.imu licated ? He kniew of none. Why,
then, are these resolutions now broughrbe
fore the house. If these inftruflions are pro
per o be given now, they were equally pro
per at the time when the dispatches were re
ceived. The last information we have from
our Commiflionera fays, that they have ad
dr (Ted a Memorial to Government, and if it
be not Ihortly answered, they (hall demand
their passports. Yet gentlemen are nowdefi
rotis of changing eur present lituatio'n, though
it is really in no fefpect different from what it
was at the time our firft dispatches were re
ceived. What was the ground taken at that
time? 11 was tills. It was thought to be ex
tremely doubtful that our negociation would
succeed, Snd that therefore it was proper to
put the country into a (fateofdefencefprwar,
but to wait the event of the negociation, be
fore -jr was either declared or made.
When gentlemen wish the resolutions upon
the table 10 be adopted, they must do it from
an idea that a change has taken place in our
situation, which has diminilhed our hopes of
accommodation. Let us, said Mr. G. even
that, and that there is now lefshope of
our negociation succeeding than heretofore,
yet it is not less a fail that our Commissioners
are not yet left Paris. As to the reports which
had been alluded toas to their having been since
received, or the contrary, he meant to take
no notice of them. He pre fumed the house
knew nathingof what had taken place since
the date of the last dispatches. But if he
were to draw any inference from what he
heard and saw on the fubjeft, it would be,
that the negociation is guing 011, though the
fact might be other wife. Butwhilftthe fail
is doubtful, what is the motion beforp the
house ? It is not to rejeil the resolutions but
to postpone the consideration of them until
the doubt is removed. And could it be pro
per, whilfl doubts exist as to the fate of our
negociation, and when every day may be ex
pected to remove the uncertainty, to adopt
resolutions of this kind ? Besides, whatdif
iidvantage would arise to the United States
from a postponement ot these resolutions for a
fortnight f Was it because his colleague had
yesterday laid these resolutions upon the ta
ble, tiiat it had become all at once so impor
tant to adopt them ! It the measure was so
very necellary, how happened it thatihecom
mittee appointed on the fubjeel of the pro
teition of commerce anrl the defence of the
country, had not recommended the measure >
He himfelf could fee no inconvenience which
could arise from the proposed delay.
On the other hand, what may be the con
sequence of going immediately into the mea
iure!. It may be a very serious one. It may
involve the country in a war, which the de
lay may prevent. Gentlemen fay a favoura
ble result is not to be expected. He owned
his hopes were (lender, but whilst there exilts
a pollibility of their being realized, he was
not willing to abandon tliem ; and more es
pecially when 110 inconvenience could arifa
from the polfponemtnt which is desired.
1 he d.ffiniilion which his colleague had
made betwixt War and these half-war mea
sures is perfectly fallacious. Th;it gentleman
had said, he was ready to declare war, and he
<\ cli koov s that this is only a fubftittite for a
Jeciaration of war. K:(!ory confirms this
idea. The last- war between Great Britain
and France "-v as carried on for two years before
aiieclaration took place. 111 the war of 1-755,
ivar was not declared for three or four years
'-iivr letters of marque w ere granted to Jeize
11 - e vefl'els of the enemy. He knew a dif
tinÂ£;ori nvght be found in the laws of nations,
as to the practice of the! aft century, but what
;â¢ .'"aid on that fubjefl is now altogether null
and void, froifithe practice of the pre Pent cen
tury. And the laws of nations are made up
of nothing more than what isthe general prac
tice of different nations; and as that practice
changes so does the law of nations. But sup
pose letters of marque.and reprisal could pof
iibly be considered as confident with a Itate of
peage % the laws of Narions when granted to
private vefl'els in onr filiation, it certainly
cannot be allowed that inftrudtions to public
armed vefl'els tall within that description.
A motion was made to adjourn, so the house
adjourned without taking the q teftion.
FOREIGN INTELUGENCE.
LONDON, April IX.
On Sunday morning last, Mr. Floud.the
magistrate, attended by Mr. Reeves, one of
the clerks of the Bow-street office, and
Carpmeal and Dowcett, two of Ihe runners,
and accompanied by three'of his majesty's
messengerÂ», set off for Manchester, for the
purpose of apprehending forre persons im
plicated in a charge of treasonable praftices.
They reached Manchester on Tuesday even
ing, and on Wednesday morning thirteen
persons u ere apprehended, amongst whom
are said to be two merchants of some re
fpettability, two sons of Cowdroy the prin
ter, one Cheetham, a cotton-spinner, and
one Fry, a taylor. The whole arrived last
night in town, under an escort of light-horse.
Five hundred stand of arms were likewise
found.
It is said that the information which oc
casioned the apprehenficn of these men, was
given in confluence of a quarrel among
the party, which has furnified a clue to
great difcoverie*.
It was expefled that the above persons
would undergo an examination before the
privy-coHncil thi'3 day.
The intelligence which the last letters
from the Hague bfot, of great preparations
being made in Hol'and, in order toaflift'the
French in their expedition against this covin.
ti*y, is confirmed by all the accounts fÂ«nn that
place. By the Master of a neutral veflVl ar
rived at Harwich from Holland, we learn
that fix frigates had failed from th- Tcxcl ;
and t hat every preparation was making thtre
to equip the fleet. Tliefe frigates, it ap
pears, have arrived at Flushing. Sevetal
French frigates are stationed off the rivers,
to examine all vessels that arrive, and to pre
vent any (hipping from proceeding to sea.
All vessels above 15 tons burthen employed
in inland navigation, were demanded by the
government, and were ordered to Flushing
and Oftend, where they were collecting, and
from whence it was supposed they are all to
be conveyed to Dunkirk.
The Achilles, of 74 guns, was launched
yesterday at Gravefend.
A meeting of the lotdj lieutenants of the
countries was yesterday held at Mr. Dundas's
office, at which a deputation from the hon.
court of lieutenancy of the city of London
attended. In the evening, circular letters,
containing the plan of national defenfe, were
sent to the residences of the different gentle
men.
The Duke of York appointed a meeting
this dav with the officers of the different
volunteer corps, who have affocia.ted them
selves for the fefvice of the kingdom, to de
liver inflruflions to them for their conduct
in cafe of any attempt of the enemy to in
vade this tountry.
Proofs of a de.-p and mod dangerous con
spiracy to aid the enemy in their attempts at
! invading this country, are every day be
coming more manifeft. Very important
difcoveriw have, we understand, been made
in donfequence of the arrest of the persons at
Manchester, and who are now under exam
ination at the privy council. A eonfidera
ble number of the military in that negh
bourhood had been sworn by an association
at Mancheftef, profeffir.g to have for their,
objeft a parliamentary reformâThe purport
of the oath impof-d upon the deluded sol
diery was, that if-government persisted in
opposing a Parliamentary reform, they
would, in cafe of landing of the enemy, re
volt from their officers. This fociely at
Manchester has been in cdnftant correspon
dence with the United Irishmen, and like
wise with the government of France. Their
treasonable arts have been praflifed chiefly
upon those corps composed of Scotch and
Irish. These deluded men, will, we ti*ft,
become sensible of their crime, arid a tone
for it by a moae zealous discharge of their
duty for their time to come. In the lin ug
of the coat of one of the persons fei2ed at
Manchester, it is said papers have been found
sowed up, containing inftrudlions to the
French how to aft en their landing,pointing
out the weakest part of the coast. ard advising
them of the fnpport they were likely to
meet with.
In the present flage of this most interest
ing business, we deem it improper to pub
lish all the circumstances that have come to
our knowledge. The discovery has been
providential, and we doubt net but the con
sequences will lead to the future security and
tranquility of the country. The deteftion
as we have been informed, was made by a
soldier who had been sworn inâHe formed
one of a party which was marching from
Manchester to Derby. This man had been
en'rufted by the leading conspirators with
three hundred guineas, for the purpose of
extending corruption to the military at the
latter place.
The man got drunk on his march, and
whether fr.m the remorse of'confcience, or
in the wantonnefs of intoxication, we know
not, he made a conieffion of the business ia
which he was engaged and thus some of the
persons implicated were difcovercd.

PHILADELPHIA,
FRIDAY EVENING, June 15.
CON G R ESS.
Yesterday rfie House of Representatives of
the Unilcd States went into a com.f.Â»ttee of the
w hole on the bill providing arms for the mili
tia throughout the United States ; which, af
ter some discussion, and the introduction ot se
veral amendments, was agreed to, and order
ed to be read a third time to-morrow. The
provision in the bill which dire&ed that the
arms should be diltribured in due proportion
among the several states, and within each di
vision of militia of the state, was ttrucL outâ
they are now directed to be deposited at fuita
blc places; and a provilion was moved by the
â¢Speaker, and agreed 10, that in cafe the
arms should not all of them be purchaled,
and any emergency Ihould arise which ihall
occasion a call of the militia, that they lhall
be loaned to such of the militia as (hall Hand
in nee*l of them. The blank for containing
the number of fttfrtds of arms to be provided,
was filled wit# jo, 000, the sum of money ap
propriated for carrying the aft into effed
400,000 dollars. The house also went into a
committee ot the whole on the bill supplemen
tary to, and to amend the dtt authorizing the
President oi the United States to raise a pro
visional army. The bill conlitts of three lec
tions, the tirfl goes to exempt the volunteers
from militia duty ; the second to authorize
the appointment of field officers ; and the
third, to authorize the sale or loan of such
pieces of artillery, small arms and accoutre
ments, from the public arsenals as shall be
found neceflary for the equipment and train
ing of such volunteers.
1 General Shepard moved to strike out the
firft (edion of the bill, from an idea that thele
volunteer corps would go to the deftru6iion
of the mifitia. This motion, after some de
bate, was negatived 46 to 26. On motion oi
General Smith, the words and luho after the
word li army" and Jball be after the word
" establish," were (buck, out, which rendered
the fe&ion positive that all volunteers shall
fubmitto fuih rules of discipline as the Pre
sident shall direift and ellablilh in their train
ing and discipline. The seCtion was then a
greed to. Some difcuflion Fbok place on the
3d fettion, with refpeit to the power
given to the President to loan artille
ry, small arms and accoutrements to the
volunteers ; but before the qneftion on a mo
tion of General Smith, to strike out small
arms and accoutrements, and confine the loan
to pieces of artillery, was taksn, the commit
tee rose, and had leave to fit again.
A bill was received from the Senate, au
thorizing the President of the United States
to accept ot any veflel of war which may be
offered to him for the public service, in addi
tion tothofe heretofore provided.
Mi. Sewall, from the committee ap
pointed to confer with the Senate on the fub
je& of our adjournment, reported that they
had held a inference with the committee
from the Senate, the result of which was,
44 That in their opinion, it is probable Congress
may adjourn about the middle of July, at least un
til thÂ« beginning of O&ober next ; but that the
state of public affairs renders it inexpedient to re
solve at present upon the time of adjournment."
Thf. YOUNG MEN of the counts of Grccn/viUc,
To thi PRESIDENTof thkUNI I ED STATES.
SIR,
TO assure you of our concurrence, at tkif time,
with the mesfures pursued by you, in support of oidtf
independence, is not the purpose of thi* addtefs. It
is to claim a (hare in the defence of our country and
once more shew the contrail between the defenders of
liberty, and the hirelings of despotism. We trust we
are not drgencrated from our fathers who obtained
our liberties, and be it out care to prefeive the fair in
heritance inviolate.
Suffer us to assure you, that you have only to point
out the mode, and our lives now, as ever they have
been, (hall willingly be facrificed in the defence of
our liberties and government.
Wejregietour diftancc from Philadelphia, as by

To the PRESIDENT or thi UNITED STATES.
THE the town of Martinfburg, and vi
cinity, in the state of Virginia, whole hand* are
hereunto fubferibed, beg leave to express to yoa the
great fatisfe&ion they feel from a view of the general
policy and conduttof the government of the United
States in their foreign relations. Having prudently
determined upon a system of perfeft neutrality, we
fineereiv believe, that a facrcd regard to its duties, to
ward the poweis of Europe, who have been long en
raged in a deftru&ive war ; an ardent desire to pre
serve to the .lilted States, thebleffings of peace* so
lefirable to its citizens ; an anxious foliciiudeto cul
:vate harmony and live on terms of friendly inter
courfc with all nations, hasbeen the invariab e policy
of our government. The wife, just, modeiate and
prudent measures you have pursued to prevail upon
chegovernmen/ of France, to rc(pcÂ£t our rights, to
ceale from the unjust and cruel depredations on our
defencelefs commerce, and to liibmit to a fair and can
did discussion, every fubjedt of complain', which she
hasmade(we believeunjulily) agair.il our government,
must evince to the whole world your fixed determin
ation to pursue the fame wife just and prudent policy.
It is with a deep but indignant regret we find that the
government*oi France, abandoning every principle of
honor and justice which ought to govern nations,
~allous to the miferiesever attendant on a state of war
.0 the human race ; proud, vain and haughty in the
elevated nations in which i<s membeis appear to be
unmeritedly.placed, has not only refilled, with cit
umftances of unparalleled infulr, every effort on
\our part, to restore harmony and friendly intercourse
between the two nations, but have threatened to add
i ravage of our defencelefs to the innumerable
robberies committed on our property on the seas.
They have not flopped here. MilcalcuUting, v.e
trull, upon finding a number of our fellow citizens so
abandoned as k to aid them, they have even threatened
>ur independence as a nation. In thislituation of our
country, we hold it an indifpcnfcUe du:y to declare to
you, that we peffefs but one fenumrnt on the occa
fwrp Highly aj we ettimate the blcilir'ws of p^ace,
yet we never will confait to prostrate the liberty and
independence of our country at the feet of Franop, or
any other nation upon earth. Relying with full con
fidence an the wisdom, prudence and patriotism 06
our government, its measures upon this alaimiog oc
cation, we b=g leave to affuie you Sir, will meet
with every aid and support in our power to give
them. May 9, '9B.

GENTLEMEN,
I than!: you for this truly American addrcTi
âThefatiifadion you feel, from a view of the
general policy and conduit of ths government, in
their foreign relations, is a good proof of their
wisdom, and equity.
The approbatidn y#u exprefj of the meafores
pursued by iÂ»i, to prevail upon the government
of Franc# to reipeel our rights, to cease from the
unjust, and cruel depredations, on our defencelefi
commerce, and to fubmic to a candid difcuflion
every fubjeit of complaint, is very honorable to
meâthe conduct of France in mum, haÂ» left ut
no alternative but reliftance.
YÂ»ui affur..nce, that you possess but one senti
ment, that you never will consent to prostrate
your country at the feet of France, and that the
measures of government will meet with every aid
and support in your power to give them, is all
that your country or your government can desire.
JOHN ADAMS.
Philadelphia, June 9tb, 1798.
At a meeting of the citizens of Charleston,
held at St. Michael's church, on the sth
of May, 1798, purfuarit to public notice,
the following rtfolutions were unatiimouf
ly adopted, viz
Resolved, That the citizens of Charleston,
having seen, with deep rejjret, the aliena.
tion of the French Repnbhc from the Uni
ted States, learnt, with sincere fatisfaftion,
the appointment of a solemn embafly, com
posed of three of ft diftinguilhtd ci
tiÂ«ens of the United iStates, entruftel with
adequate powers, and with liberal, wife
and conciliatory inftruftions, " for the pur
pose of terminating, all diffe ences between
the United States of America and the
French Republic, and of restoring and con
firming perieft harmony and good tinder
ftanding, and re-establishing a commercial
and friendly intercourse with them."
Resolved, That they have understood,
with real sorrow, that the expeftations
founded on this embafly have been disap
pointed, so that, " there exists bo hope,
thitt the objeSs of the mifliSn will be, in
any wiy, attomplifhed." ~.
Refalvtd, That it is abtalutely necessary,
at this awful moment, when the most hu
miliating demands have been made on this
country ; and those demands avowedly
growing out of an idea of an internal divi
sion ;âto declare, publicly and explicitly,
our feed determination to maintain the con
(litution, support the government, aii<l de
fend the independence of the United States,
to the utmost of our power, and, at all ha
zards, against the encroachments of every
foreign nation,
Resolved, therefore, That a Committee be
appointed to prepare an address to the Pre
sident, Senate and Hosfe of Rcpreft nta
tives, communicating to them, the unalter
able resolutions we have taken and expressed,
and soliciting that the most prompt and ef
fectual provifioh may be made for the pro
teftion of the commerce, defence of the
territory,and maintenance of the sovereignty
of the United States.
As the sudden and great demands, which
may be made on the government of the Uni
ted States, for the purposes of national de
fence, may oblige a too limited pro ifion
for the fortifications eflential to the secu
rity of the sea-ports :
Resolved, That a' voluntary contribution
be raised by fubfeription, in aid of the sums
which have been, or may be, appropriated,
by the government, to the fortification and
defence of the city and harbor of Charleston
and the inlets of this state.
That General Walhtngton, Colonel Ed
ward Rutlcdge, Colonel Vanderliorft, the
Intendant, Colonel Le.-, Major Simmonj,
and Mr. Nathaniel Ruflell, be a Committee,
to obtain and collrft such fubferiptions, and
to superintend the application of the sumÂ»
â so raised to the said purpose, in concurrence
with the engineer of the United States, and
of the state engineer.
By order of the meeting,
JOHN EDWARDS, Chairman.
To JOHN ADAMS,
PRESIDENT or THE UNITED STATES.
The ADDRESSÂ£3"MEMORIAL
Ofthecitlzens ofCharlefton, South-Carolina
Shewcth RefpeSfully,
THAT your memorialifh learnt, with
the most sincere fatisfaftion, the appoint
ment, by the Executive Government of the
United States, of a solemn embafly, duly
empowered and wifely inftrufted, to endea
vourto removealldifferences with the French
Republic, and to maintain the relations of
amity and peace berween the two countries.
That yuur memorialists have understood
with the deepest regret, that the spirit of
conciliation andpeacemanifefted by the gov
ernment of the United States, hath been!
met by a spirit of hostility, in the councils
of the French Republic ; and that the mis
ifters of peace had not been admitted to the
privilege of an audience, fcaroely ever deni
amorig civilized nations.
That the most unreasonable demands have
been made upon this country, by persons
pretending and appearing to aft under the
authority of the French Government; but
which, it is sincerely hoped, not with the
sentiments of the people of France; with
out even the pretence of injury or wrong
having been committedâdemands which, if
submitted to, would prostrate the United
States at the sett of France, and convert
her from a free and independent nation, into
a tributary and degraded province.
Your memorialitls are aftonithed to find
1 hat thefc demands hare been perfeveringly
urged, upon a prd'umption that the Ame
ricans were a divided people ; and would ne*
vtr unite in fuppott of their own govern
ment, in opposition to these demands ; and
that upon this fallacious idea, our commerce
hath been harraffed, without redress; andoOr peace and our independence ate
. ened.
Deeply affiled at this state of the public
affairs, your memorials feel themfelvea ir
resistibly impelled to make a full, solemn and
explicit declaration, of their sincere attach
ment to the constitution and government of
the United States ; ond of their fined refo.
lutinn to maintain an I support them against
ALL foreign encroaC*imentand domina ion,
at the hazard of their lives and fortunes
j Your memorialists are but too well acquaint
ed with the miseries and calamities of war,
and they would will rvly have averted them,
by the facrifiee of secondary interests But
they do not hesitate to dt=el*re their prefer
ence of every calamity to a servile fubjedtion
to a foreign yokeÂ«
Yoor memorialists repose confidence in the
wisdom and patriotism of the constituted
authorities â¢, a d trult that the mod prompt,
vigorous and efficacious steps will be taken,
" to provide for the common defence, pro
mote the general welfare, and secure the
blessing* of liberty to ourselves and our pos
terity" they submit, to the difcretiori
of the Government, the measures eflential j
to the attainment and security f these g-eat .

2. That when any company have affoci

4. Tiiat fucE of U3 as are of health and 35
f constitution to undergo the fatigues of a
, camp, will voluntarily offer ourselves, for
â¢ f repelling, unrter the direaions of the Ex- tyl
o ecutive, any invasion of this (late and for on
the fitpp- rt of the civil authority.
's* That if the militia and volunteers of

manner in our power." Sou
Alter the proposals had been read .a fe- iVIu
cond time, the Chairman inquired i l any
person had anvobjeai. n to the proposals.
[ Several persons expressing their approbation
; a "d no one difappvoving, the ch. irman put f a ;j
P the queltion, whether the citizens present j Hn
P approved the proposals, and it was th;re
upon voted unanimoudy in the affirmative. fâ
It was r.ext moved by Mr. Hollingfworth , 2
and seconded by Mr. Tilghman, that acorn ,

This illutlrious example merits universal
imitation : under the benign influence of tin's Mr
spirit we emerged from colonial infignifi- ;
cance, intÂ» existence as a nation. Underthis buj
spirit we mult now lctk refuge from ignorr.i- ton
ny and (Livery. But it mull and ought to p ;
be rtaliz d, that these measures and the pre- t ,. r|
valence of this spirit are not more honour- i 3o ,'
able and praise worthy, than tbrv are necef- tn
fary. Unless we would (hare the fate of
Switzerland, whose (teps we have till recent- teel
ly minutely followed, it is essential that ev- : co _
ery man be ready at all point's, not otily to Yoi
repel violence by vigorous adion, but ,i le
lay down his life in defencj of the liberty of j mol
bis country. I-or this event, the citizens i
of Philadelphia, old men and yonn j men, ! jj r( .
are, one and all, prepared. With a ioud ig, ,
voice they cry " para/i fumus" âtheir con-j r
dutft proves itâand the godlike energies ! Au
which they (hew forth or. all fides, p o j;
brate in the loudest tones of nature to every q
extremity of tht Union, they nnuft rtfound p|, a
thro' the remotcft tealms of the universe and jÂ» tc
thunder terror and difnjay into the hfarts cf ; g a ]

By henry hunter, d. d. .
'"P'HIS very ingrmicut ii.ttreltiog and inttruSive r
X werk has fines its firft publication, gone c
through four I'uc'ctffive imprefÃons, under the an- t
thor's immediate infpeiftion j besides a variety of '
printed editions in different part, of the European
continent. k
No book displays a more sublime theology, in
culcates a pur.r morality, or breathes a more ar
dent and eipanfilje philanthrophy. St.Pierre ena '
bles us to contemplate this universe with other
' eyes ; has furnilhed new arguments to combat I
' athtifm J has established, beyond the power of I
: contradiction, the do<strine of a univerfalprovi- 1
5 d.nce, has excited a warmer interull in favor of , 1
: suss.ring humanity, and has discovered sources, .
' unknown before ot moral and mtelle&ual enjoy
" ment. ]
The avidity with which the clergy and other I
learned charaAersin New-England, have purchaf- I
ed the EngliGi edition of this delightful pel form- 1
ance, and the opinion entertained by them ; and
warranted by experience, that although written
before the " *ge of Reason," a part Â»f it con
-1 taint a more solid and compleat refutation of it,
1 than any thing publiihed finer, are perhaps a fuffi
c cient recommendation of the Stud es of Nature ;
in which the Botanill, the natural and chrillian
Philofophcr, the friend of .rder and government
.. are equally interested, and by whieh they will be,
equally gratified.
As no pains nor expence have been spared in
procuring suitable paper and able artists, to render
s the work worthy ef tht public ; and as the Sub
fcribers have expressed their approbation of it, the
e publilher flatters himfelf, that gentlemen, who on
â¢ account of the bad paper and print of fimi Ameri
â¢ can editions, give generally the preference to the
Eaglifh, w ill hooor this with a companion, before
J" they purchase.

the work executed by both, as it is a mode almost
universally adopted by tlaem to invalidate the ta
