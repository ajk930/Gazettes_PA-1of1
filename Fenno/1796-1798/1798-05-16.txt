P HILADELPHIA,
WEDNESDAY EVENING, Mat 16-
The Address of the Inhabitants of the Borough
of Harrijburgh, in the State of Pennjyl
vania
To mi PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.
Six,
AT a time, when the minds of men are
so intoxicated with ideas of .reform, and vi
sionary schemes for meliorating the condi
tion of humanity, as to be fatally inattentive
to their own feeurity, and regardless of
confederations which have, hitherto been
deemed tne mo ft sacred and obligatory ;
there may be a propriety in the declaration
of fentimrnts which, in more fettled times,
might at leaftbe thought fuperfluou6. From,
the generality also of the pradice of e*
pressing approbation of the measures of
government, at the present crisis, motives
might be attached to tbe omiflion of it, lef6
honorable than a disinclination to intrude
upon the managers of the public concern?,
or a reluftance to suppose that, in the re
fillatice of outrage and maintenance of na
tional independence, they would not receive
the support of the virtuous and unprejudiced
part of the community.
Under theft iinpreffion&, the sub
scribers, inhabitants of the borough of Har
rifburgh, beg leave to declare, that we are
too highly sensible of the prosperity we
enjoy, tote willing to relinquish it without
an tfiort'for its preservation ; and that, in
our wishes for the happiness of others, we
have not loft fight of our country and our
selves.âThat, in our opinion, the conduct
and designs of the French Republic (fcarcelv
aggravated or made mare apparent by the
profligacy of their avowal) are such as to
produce alarm and indignation ir\ every
breast which feels for the honor and happi
ness of America, and to excite the appre
hensions of pvery man, of whatever nation
or country, who may place a sense ofjuftice,
morality, and piety, ameng the ornament# of
his nature and the blessings of society
That, under this persuasion, we hold it wife
to be prepared for every event, and shall
therefore most cheerfully acquiesce in such
measures of defence, as may be adopted by
you, Sir, and the other Branches of the
Adminiflration, at the present momentous
period. And as your patt condud has in
variably commanded the refpeft and appro
bation of every ingenuous mind, so we have
the most perfea reliance that, in future, it
it will continue to be influenced by the
fiiireft motives and cleared perceptions of
the public good. We beg you to accept,
our cordial wishes for your personal welfare
and happiness. \

burgh, in the State of Pennfylvanta.'
CEVTIEMEN, j
YOUR address has been prefentled to me j
by Mr. Hartley, Mr. Sitgreaves, and Mr.
Hanna, three of your Representatives in J
Congress.
I know not which to admire most, the [
Concifencfs, the Energy, the Elegance, or
profound Wisdom of this excellent address. .
Ideas of reformation, and schemes for J
meliorating the condition of humanity, ;
fliould n?t be difcoHraged, when proposed ,
with reason and pursued with rhoderation; ,
but the rage for innovation, which destroys
every thing because it is and in. t
troduces absurdities, the most monstrous, c
merely because they are new; was never
carried to such a pitch of madness in any ]
age of the world, as in this latter end of the f
boasted eighteenth century, and never pro- a
duced effe&s so horrible upon fufFering hu
manity.
Among all thÂ« appearances, portentous 0
6f evil, there is none tpore incomprehensible g
than the profeflions of republicanism among
those who place not a sense ofjuftice, mo
rality, or I'iety, among the ornaments of
their nature and the blessings of society. ' p
As nothing is more certain and demonstra
ble than that free republicanism cannot exist
without these ornaments and blessings, the
tendency of the times is rapid towards a
restoration of the petty military despotisms ; r
of the feudal anarchy, and by their means a q
return to the savage state of barbarous life.
How can the press prevent this, when all f
the presses of a nation, and indeed of many ac
nations at once, are fubjeft to an imprima- w
tur, by a veto upon pain of conflagration, a
banishment, or confifcation ? j, t
That America may have the glory of d,
arrelling this torrent ofljfcrror, vice, and f r
impoftnre, is my fervent wish j and if f-nti- cc
menW, as great as those from Harrifburgh, ac
should be found universally to prevail, as I r j,
detfbt not they will, my hopes will be as
sanguine as my wishes. n ;

The firm reliance wehaife had on your pa- C p

Whatever may be the real or imaginary 0 f

GENTLEMEN,
THIS refpedtful and afFe&ionate address,.
from the wealthy, industrious and indepen
fe nt Pfoprietdrs of the county of Lancafler,
U is as- boaorable, 3s it is sgreeable to me, and
is returned with my hearty thanks.
1 he attention yau have given to a de
y iftand of a prtliminaiy fubmiffien, acknow.
[3 'edging the corumiffion of offence, requires
an oblervation on my part. The conftitn-
tien of the United States makes it my duty
to communicate to Congress, from time to
time, information of the state of the union,
and to recommend to their consideration,
measures which appear to me necefTary or
expedient. While in discharge of this duty,
I fubrtlit, with entire resignation, to the re
sponsibility established in the constitution,
I hold myfelf accountable to no crowded
head, or Executive iDireftory, or other so
â r eign power on earth, for the communica- <
tions which my duty obliges me to make ; :
yet to you, my Fellow-Citizens, I will I
. ' ret 'y fay, that, in the cafe alluded to, the 1
honor done, the publicity and solemnity <
given to the audience ef leave, to a disgraced I <
minister, recalled in difpleafurc for mifcon- <
was a fludied insult to the government '
of my country- c
The obfervatioFis made by me, were mild,
' and moderate, in a degree far beyond what t
the provocation would have juftified ; and i
J if the American people, or their govern- 1
ment, could have born it without resent- t
ment, offered as it was in the face of all the v
1 world, they mud have bees fit to be the t
tributary dupes they have fuce been so r
; c Â°oly invited to become. e
As I know not where a better choice of t
Envoys could have been made, I thank you
for your approbation of their appointment, n
and applause of their condudL c
Iu return for your prayers, for my health I
and fortitude, I offer mine for the citizens *

:ch | GENTLEMEN,'
;ht Your Address to the President and Cou
ro- grefs of the United States, has been pre
nd fented to me, by your representative in Con
to grefs. Mr. Matthews.
ns, Under a eonftitution, organized by the
â¢y, wifdotn of the peddle, alike inimical to a
ia- narchV, and hereditary power, every public
nd fun&icmary deriving authority mediately or
immediately from the pipple, there cannot
en be a greater absurdity in theory, than an
ite opinion in a foreign country, that the mea
jft fures of this government may be defeated or
ur embarralTed by the confli&ing opinions sos
x- individuals, nor can there be a greater af
to front, or more injuriÂ®us reflection cast -on
:ig representative governments ; for if the prin
:ir ciple were well founded, the necelfary con
:es sequence would be, that the people are in
n- capable of supporting a government of their
to own choice and fabric ; and that govern
an ment mud be hereditary, in order to givi it
of ftreugth, to combine the public opinion, to
draw together the wills and forces of the
if- people. Your zeal therefore to repel this
of idea so degrading to Americans, is natural
if- and well founded.
,ir Your declaration that by all the meass in -
is your power, you will support the decisions
in of the constituted authorities is in the cha
racter of the best of citizens.
There is not one of you, my fellow-citi
:d zens, more anxious for the diminution of
the public debt, than myfelf, and a well re- '
r, gulated finking fund may one day be re
sorted to, as a powerful engine for that pur- r
pose, but I fear we fliall find a necessity of f
s> . postponing this salutary operation in its full i
i- extent to a time when the honor and fafety i
r, of the nation lhall be better secured than at *
d present.
Your approbation of my couduA is very '
precious to me, and deserves my thanks. t

A number of refpcdable citizens of this P

- as forming an important Crisis in our public P

: dence in the constituted authorities of our P'
r country, conceived that, at this time, to al
i evidtnee that attachment, and that confi- J
- dence, could not but be ufeful to our com- [j
t mon interests and acceptable to those who a
direst our public councils. bt
> therefor* appointed us a committee P<
: to convey to the Executive of the United re
1 States, and to both houfea of Congress,
. their approbation of the measures pursued
. by the Executive, in the late negociation t 0
: with France ; to assure them of their unaba- th
â  ted confidence in our rulerr ; and of their cc
1 readiness and zeal to forward and support El
every measure which lhall be dire&ed for m
the interest, and the honour of our country.
In communicating these sentiments, our m
minds were naturally led to a review of the 9r
conduft of our government towards the tic
French republic ; and in that review, it is
with pleasure we observe that we have be
held it, on every occafiot*, performing with
the most perfeft integrity and good faith, fl
ail its engagements to that country and e- â
vincing its regard by every ad of friend ship
in its power, confident with those duties lo
which it owed to other nations.
While on the other hand, the conduft of P r
Fiance to this country has heen a scries of "J
insult, depredation, and menace, more be- tn
coming conquerors and masters than the th,
friends and allies of a free and independent tal

Under different pretences, as variable as
they have been futile, (he has mfulted our thl

them from their government j (he has in the
contravention of the faith of treaties no less cit
than of the laws of nations, difpoiled our ri S
countrymen when engaged in a lawful com
merce ; and she has impriloned their persons. C Â° l
To our mild remonstrances and our pacific â¢
overtures, for accommodation of differances tirr
and restoration of former friendlhip, sh e has citi
answered only by frefh indignities.- Not '' fe
content with humbling our country by the a ' M
refufal to receive an ordinary Ambassador, P"
lent to explain and conciliate, she has dif- f
dained even to treat, in the usual forms, Â°!
with the extraordinary Miniders, who in pre
the persevering fp,ât ofpeace and accommo- me
on were afterwards deputed ; as if anxi- ll| e
ous to accumulate disgrace upon us,' (he P ro
held out to them the mod humiliating terms, ,

le- What advantage he afkÂ«d, wa, derived to thiT
oauntry from giring aliens eligibility to office?
1 he people of this country were certainly equal to
the legislation and admmiflration of their own '
government, compFifing all the aliens who are
now becoma citizen,. He had nodoubt but many
aliens would become very valuable acqaifition, to
S . thls co " nt sy 5 but he had no idea of admitting them
into the government. He did not wish to open
the door to the mtngues of other countries thi,
way ; since weknow th'ercare countrieswhofe chief
n . attention is paid to the obtaining of influence in the
ln COHc erns of the countries over which they
of wife to have dominion. And he cbutffce it poffi.
a _ blc that perlons might be furnifhed by such a
country to come here and buy lands, and by that
e . means, in time, get into the government. Great
Britain he said, was very careful 0Â£ the avenues
, wh,ch led to her liberty in this refpe<ft. Aliens
' were there excluded from holding all places of
â  honor, profit or trull. The situation of America
heretofore was differencfrom what it is at present.
It had not only been thought good policy iR times
e past, to encourage foreigners to coir eto this coun
try, but atfo to admit them into the legislature and
n important offices. But now, said he, America is
growing into a nation of importance, and it would
1- be an objeA with foreign nations to gain a.l influ
ence in our councils; and before any such attempt
e was made, it was proper to make provifios agaiuft
it ; for if the time should ever arrive when anutn
-0 ber of persons of this description had found their
s way into the legiflaturfe, a motion of this kind
would of cosrfe be very odious. If however,
s _ guntlemen were of a different opinion, and think
1 the object would be better accompliflied by extend
. in g the Vefidence of aliens, he should not obje<ft to
s that course being taken, though he thought the
f one he proposed perfeftly within the povi cr of thÂ«
houfi.
Mr. Sitgreaves wished, thst in attaining
an objeft in which all seemed to concur, they
-1 might avoid any constitutional embarrass
. ment ; and this it was allowed might be
j done by extending the time of residence of
aliens so far, as to prevent them from ever
' becoming citizens, by which means persons
_ who could not be considered as having s
common interest with the citizen* of the
country, would be effeftually excluded front
holding offices in the government.
The amendment of tjia gentleman from
MalTacKuretts, he believed was liable to an
objeftion of a different kind. It proposes
that no alien born shall enjoy any plaee of
honor, profit or trust under the United
States. It vras a doubt, which had been
suggested (and not yet been decided) in the
business of W. Blount's impeachment,
whether a member of either branch of the *
legislature could be considered as an officer
of government. This question wauld be
avoided in the other mode of proceeding.
With refpedi to military employments, he
supposed it would be improper to exclude
aliens from them, and there might be other*
in wh;ch they might be properly employed,
of which the Prelident and (enate would be
â¢ the proper judges. The great objeA was
to prevent such persons from being elected
into either branch < f the legislature, or in
to the offices of President or Vice-President
âoffices in which the sovereignty of the
country is materially concerned, and in
which, of course, foreign influence might
prove mod mischievous. He hoped, there
fore, that the present motion would be
withdrawn, and that the fame objeft would
be attained in the way he had mentioned.
Mr. Oil's withdrew his amendment; and
then all the three rclolutions were jg-reed to,
without a diflenting voice.
The committee rose, and reported the
resolutions. The two firft were concurred
in ; but on the question being put on the
third, ' . ,
Mr. N. Smith said a foreign government
might do an aft tantamount to war, with
out declaring it, yet according to the word
ing of this proposition, the citizens of that
country could not be removed. He there
fore moved to amend the proposition ad
ding the words " being-native citizens of any
country the government ivbereof Jhall be al
war with the United States."
Mr. Sewall said, the only objection that
he had to this amendment arose from the
consideration that congress alone had the
power of deciding on the question of war,
3nd he could not therefore fee hÂ«w it could
be determined that any nation wai at war
with us, until the declaration was made by
that nation, or by congress.
Mr. Otis wished his friend from Connec
ticut would admit of au amendment which
he held in his hand, in the place of that
which he had offered. It was in the fol
lowiug words : "cr Jlall authorise hojliiilies 1
again// the United States."
Mr. N. Smith had no objfftion.
Mr. M'Dowell thought this motion more
objeftionable than that of the gentleman
from Cotine&icut. It ought to be remem
bered, Mr, M'D. said, that inducements
had been held out to foreignfrs to come tÂ»
this country, and many of them had come
with a view of becoming citizeos of thi*country, and many he believed were as good
as any amongst us Out of refpefl to these |
foreigners he Ihould not with to place them
in the situation which this amendment went
to place in them ; because it might be said
hoftilitie were au horiftd when no war was
declared, and these people might be treated
as if the nation from which they came was
at war with us, whin no war existed. It
had been said our population was now fuffi
cient, and that the privileges heretofore al
lowed to fereigntrs might now be with
drawn. In fovie parts of t'le country, this
might, in some degree, be the cafe ; but
he knew there were other parts which want
ed population. From this conCderation,
and as he did not wilh unneceflarily to dif-.
trefsthe minds of foreigners who had taken
up their residence amongst us, he should
vote ai; inft this am* Wnt.
Mr. J. William! -wn' persuaded, that if
this pr-ipofiti'in palTe<l no good citizen need
be afraid of being disturbed. He had no
objection to this resolution with ut the a
tnendment, nor had he any particular ob
jedfcion t"> the amendment. ;
Mr. Rutledge was so far from believing
that this amendment would check the emi
gration of foreigners, he believed it
would encourage it. Foreigners same here
to live under a good government, and the
more fecute the government was made the
greater would be their deCre to live under it;
and he believed greater security could not
be given to it, than was proposed to be giv
en by this amendment. It was wilhed to
veil a power in the President to fend out of
the country, perfonswho were natives of a
country with whom are at war, or who
may -have authorised hostilities against us.
in faft, that in the situation of things in
which we are now placed, the President
filould hive the power of removing fueh in
triguing agents and spies as are now spread j
all over the country. What said Mr. R.
would be the conduft of France, if in our
situation ? In twenty four hours, every
man of this description would either be sent l
out of the cotfiitry, or put in goal, and !
such conduft was wife. Was there noth
ing, Mr. R. nfked, to admonish lis to take
a measure of kind ? Yes there was. A
gentleman from Kentacky (Mr. Davis) had
said, that a person was in that ftatedeliver
irig commissions into the hand of every man
who was so abandoned as to receive them.
Other means were also taken tojajienate the
the attachment of our citizens ; a d are we
still, said he to fay, we will not fend these
persons out of the country until a declara
tion of war is N made ! If these persons are
Suffered to remain, France will never de
clare war, as (he will consider the residence
of these men amongst us, as of greater con
feqaence, than the lining of our sea-board
with privateers, or covering our coasts with
men.

CONGRESS.
Yesterday, the Rsufe of Representatives
of the United States were occupied during '
the whole of the fitting, in debating whether 'â 
the following proceedings of Captain Mag
n'en's company of Grenadiers, at Portsmouth,
in Virginia, which were presented to the
house by Mr. Josiah Parker, should, or'
(hould not, be referred to the committee of j
the whole on the date ot the union. The
qneftion for reference was finally carried 46 J
to 43. The debate, with the yeas and nays .
upon the question will appear in course.
At a meeting ot Capt. Bernard Magnien's
Company of Grenadiers, at the Muster
Ground on the Commons of Portsmouth,
the sth of May, '9B, the following proceed
ing took place :
Whereas we venerate the " Declaration
1 of Rights made by the Reprefentativesof the
good people of Virginia, alfembled in full
and free convention, on the 6th day of May,
1776, which rights do appertain to them and
their pufterity, as the basis and foundation of
government."âAnd whereas, it was declar
ed, by the said convention, among other
things, " that all power is veiled in, andcon
" fequently derive.d from the people ; that
" Magistrates are their trustees and servants,
" and at all times amenable to them.â
Wherefore, in conformity with those rights,
as expressed by the said declarationâWE as
freemen and real citizens, think it a duty we
owe to ourselves, our country and posterity,
to speak our sentiments on the present alarm
ing crisis of our affairsâand accoidingly we
give it as our opinion,
That we view with extreme concern, the
attempts that are evidently making by men,
high in authority, to widen the breach be
tween the United States and the French Re
public, by holding up to the good people of
these states, the late unworthy propositions of
certain unauthorised persons at Paris,, as the
act of the French government, when, in real
ity, the face of the difpatchss cannot warrant
any such concltifions.
That we cannot but view the man, or set of
men, as inimical to the rights of the peo
ple and the found principle of their felf-go
vernment, who shall endeavour, by any falfe
colouring, to give the (tamp of authenticity to
that which is in itfelf extremely doubtful and
prafeieraatieal : and who shall, by such
means, drive to involve lis in <ill till.uni
ties ot a war with the molt powerful Republic
on earth.
That without reference to our well founded
complaints, or to occurrences frefh in me
mory of usall, nothing can be moreabhorrent
to our feelings, than the idea of being by such
a war, driven into an alliance with a nation
which isat present unhappily under the guid
ance of the 1110 ft foul and corrupt government
upon earth.
That in the administration of a
free government, is absolutely npceffary to
the fafety and well being of the (late, and
therefore such eftabliftiments, as will (urpafs
in point of expense the pecuniary resources
of the country, mult inevitably lead to the
failure of public creditâto national bank
ruptcy âand consequently to the definition
of the Federal Governmentâthan which no
thing, in our opinion, could be more calamit
ous.
That as " a well regulated militia, compo
" fed of the b9dy of the people, trained to
" arms, is the proper, natural and fafe de
" fence of a free date," we view every mea
sure which leads to the establishment of (land
ing armies, and expensive navies, as contrary
to the spirit of a free goverement, and by no
means so well calculated to ward off foreign
insult and invasion, as to invite domestic sub
jugation, slavery and ruin.
1 hat the meafu/es taken at the lad feftion
of Congrrfs for the defence of our common
country were wife and patriotic. Eighty tliou
fand of our fellow citizens and brethren of the
militia being, in our judgment, fully com
petent to the defence of our country against
any foreign nation whatever.
That-in a cafe of actual invasion from a
broad, or of domestic infurreÂ£tion at home,
we hold it to be the duty of all good citizens
and militia-men totally round the standard of
Government, and to defend our rights a
gainst all encroachments whatever ; and
therefore we pledge ourselves to appear arm
ed a;id accoutred at any moment when our
services (hall (for the purposes above menti
oned) be required.
Ordered, That the foregoing proceedings be
signed by Capt. Bernard Magnien, and Lieu
tenant John Brookes, Officers of the said
Grenadier Company, and be forwarded to
ourÃeprefentative in C6ngrefs, witlvpolitive
inftruttions for it to be laid by him before
that body as the sense of the meeting.

COMMUNICATION.
The Aurora of Saturday presented to the
public uflder the name of an Executive Mir
ror, a partial statement of the distribution
of certain Public Offices, with a profefied
view of exciting a belief that an undue pre
ference is given to citizens of the New-
England States. This mirror is nothing
more than an ordinary Jacobin Magnifying
Glass, presented to the eyes of ignorance
and credulity, that the measure? of govern
ment may appear exaggerated and diilorted
âand though the daily libel eontained in
that paper are fcareely worthy of a comment
or reply, yet the idea having been suggested,
it is a matter of amusement to examine its
foundationâThis will be seen in the two
following statements. The firll being an
exhibit of the officers who have filled the
most important places lince the adopM'on of
the eonftitution ; and the second having re

NÂ». It
At present it is true that the President is
from N. England, and the Secret ary of the
Treasury .and the Chief Jilftice, (neither of
whom were appointed by President Adams)
are from that quarter of the Union ; but
against these may be placed the followipg
lilt of officers who arc from the states south
of Nrw-England.
The Vice-Prefidefit
Secretary of State
Attorney-General
Four Judges (out of five)
Five Ministers to foreign courts (out of 7)
The Comptroller,
Auditor, iof the Treasury
Tresfurer, & f '
Regifler, J
The Commissioner of the Revenue
Purveyor of Public Supples
Three Commissioners (out of four) under
the British treaty
The Director and Treasurer of the MinÂ»â
and a full proportion of all other officers,
bot\ civil and militaryâThere is another
officer also who may be added to these,
and whom it is not possible that Benny
should so get âI mean the
Post mailer-General.
After all is said, the true question is;â
are the principal offices well filled i In thet
cafe it is immaterial from what past of our
common country the incumbents are feleft
cd. Fortunately, at present they are well
filled, but they are also, for the molt part,
indifferently paid. The faftion have in
dulged their illiberal and malignant difp<s
- by preventing an allowance of ade
quate salaries, expedting, 110 doubt, to starve
out all the honest men, and render the offices
of government a prey to needy and hungry
expe&antÃ.
