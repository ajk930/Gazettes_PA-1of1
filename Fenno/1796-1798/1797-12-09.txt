FRIDAY DECEMBER 8.
Mr. Thatcher prefented-the petition,
n _ Â°f Daniel Sevvall, as the reprefentatrvc of
Parsons, praying to have two Loan
brought forward in proper time. Referred
to the Committee of the whole to whom was
r j referred the report of the Committee of
a y Claims pn the expediency or inexpediency
e â of excepting a certain' proportion of claims
jU from the operation of the Aft of Limitati
-1 on -
M r^r - ; ColT moved, that the report of the
, n Committee of Commerce and Manufadlutes,
he made during the lift winter feflion, on the
0- petition of Pierre Joseph Flammend, in be
half of Louis le Guen, be referred to a
, _ Committee of the whole.âAgreed for Mon
day.
Mr. Sprigg moved, that the report of
a Seleft Committee 011 the petition of John
Carr, which appeared in the report of the
Committee of Revifal and Unfinifhed Bust
* ness, be referred to a Committee of the
whole. Agreed for Wednesday.
L _ Mr. T hatcher observed, that yesterday
there had been a resolution laid upon theta
>e ble by the gentleman from Vermont (Mr.
I Lyon) which he thought ought to be dis
posed of. It proposed a retrenchment of
e, the unueceflary expences of Government.
Mr. T. sAid he had observed that a refold-
| n tion of this kind was always brought for-'
ward in the feflion preceding an ele&ion.â
e> He did not wi(h, kowever, that the propofi
ig tion ihould lie longer on the table. â  If it
__ were true that the expences of Government
were excelEie, they ought immediately to
set about retrenching them; and if it were
not true, the sooner they t*ild the people
so, by reje&ing the motion, the better.
The question for agreeing to the resoluti
on was put arid negatived, 33 to 30.
Just as the Speaker was cbunting the
votes, Mr. Lyon entered, and said, had he
been present when the question was pat, he
â - should have called the Yeas and Nays upon
it.
Coit moved that tlie report of the
Committee Â«f Claims, made in January last,
1- on the petition of Edward St. Loe Liver
more, be referred to a Committee of the
j whole. Agreed for Monday.
The fame gentleman moved a resolution
to the following effedt:
" Resolved, that the committee of ways'
d and means be inftrufted to enquire whether
any, and if any, what alterations are proper
j to be made in the aft for laying a tax upon
licences for retailing wine and spirits, and"
that they report by bill or otherwise."
Mr. Coit said, that, as the law flood at
present, licences were taken for a yeai from
the time at which they were granted, be
that time when it might, so that they were
constantly becoming due. He wi/hed to
have riiis inconvenience remedied, by put
ting the law upon the fame footing with the
carriage tax, the licences under which all
became due at one time ; as when a licence
was taken, it was taken so as to fall due at'
the time fixed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. Williams said, he found in the re
port of the committee of revifal and unfinifh
ed business, the report of afeleft committee
on a letter from the Secretary of State, in
clofmg a report of the direftor of the mint,
suggesting the expediency of some altera
tions in its eftablilhmcnt, to render it less
expeufive to the public ; and as he wilhed
to render that establishment less expensive,
he moved 'that the'letter and report be re
ferred to a conlmittee of the whole house.
Agreed for Wednesday.
Mr. Harper said, that the committee
to whom it was referred to report a bill for
establishing an uniform fyftcm of bankrupt
cy, conceiving this fubjeft to be of such
general concern, embracing so great a varie
ty jof interests, and a question in which the
meraantile affairs of the community were so
deeply involved, that they had wished him
to request an augmentation of the committee.
The motion was agreed tÂ®, and eleven
members were added to the committee, com
prising a member from each state.
No business being before the house
(though only twelve o'clock) it adjourned
till Monday, a previous motion having been
passed for adjourning till that time, when
the house did adjourn.

Continuation of Late Foreign News,
By the Britifli Packet.
LONDON, Oft. 2.
The follovying is a letter from a naval officer
(late aprifoner in France) to his friend
in Greenock, dated on board his Majes
ty's ship Inipeteux, Torbay, 16th, ulti
mo :
" 0 n the flocks in the different building
yards at L'Orient, four ships of 74 guns
each ; one of was ready for launch
ing, a second qfarjy fÂ», the other two only
in the framep,,and no workmenabout them.
In the harbor pae large frigate fitting for
sea with the greatest expedition, destined
for the East-Indies, and will be ready for
sea in ten days. There were likewise a
great number of privateers fitting for sea
with no less dispatch ; one ofthemmounted
28 guns, and would fail in a few days ; her
cruising latitude was from 49 {o 25 N. and
from 19 to to W. While I remained in
L'Orient, fix privateers failed, although the
signal was flying every day in the dock-yard
for a British squadron on the coast. I was
told by the merchants at L'Orient, that they
could fepd to sea from the different ports in
France, from 400 to jooprivateers, and that
they did not mind losing a few of them ;
they flattered themselves that one British
merchantman would make up the loss of a
dozen of their JVnall craft ; indeed the crews
of these veflels prepare themselves to be cap
tured, by taking no clothes with them but
what they' have on their backs, and one
change.
" I left L'Orient on the Bth of August,
and arrived at Bred in three days afterwards.
There ygrejn tjjat harbour four ships of
the line,two of which are three-deckers,
and two two-deckers, viz. l'lnvir.cible, and
l'Ocean, of.ioo guns each, the Berwick 74
and Jupiter 80 guns, and two frigates and
a corvette, all ready for hending their fails,
except the Berwick, which had her top
mad an end, none of them well manned.
There were on the flocks one of 140 guns,
Le Vengeur, in the frames, but no people
employed on her, one of 80 guns in the fame
date, and two frigates. 111 the docks four
of 80 guns, and two of 74, but no men.em
ployed about them, three of which were in
the engagement of the id June 1794, viz.
L' Aigle, Trajan, and Tyrannicide ; and
have not been at sea since. There were in
the Inner Road 16 fail of the line, viz. two
of three decks, and three flags, the flag ships
are La Terrible and.Le Republicain of 100
guns each, aqdL'lndomptable of 74 guns ;
nine of them had their fails bent, and in a
date of readiness for sea ; the others are
not half manned, and nothing but discon
tent prevails among the seamen, on account
of want ,of wages. In the Outer Road
there were IyiÂ«g at anchor two ftiips of the
line, four frigates, one corvetSi, and a lug
ger, all readyi&nv;iea ; they were to be
joined of the line and two fri
gates from the Inner Road, and were to pro
ceed to feti iu a few days, but I could not
learn thcir.'dedinatiorf.
" I was informed, by a person at Bred,
on whose information I could place a little
dependence, that the French were making 1
preparations for a descent on Ireland and
Scotland this winter, for which purpose 1
thty had 40,000 men in the neighbourhood
of Bred ready to embark. I saw part of 1
the troopsat exercise on a grand parade day,
city ; they expedl that thisarmame\it j
before failing, will be joined by the Spaftjfh
and Dutch fleets."
> A letter from an officer in the Orion, of
â¢ 74 g uns > dated Sept. ii has been received
. here this morning ; by this letter we learn,
â  that the Orion had been at Gibraltar to
i .Water, whft;- they lay ten' days; when they
â¢ came away an attack on the town was dai
r ly expedted from the Spaniards, who feem
r ed to be making formidable preparations
: for that purpoic. Flags of truce are cou
| tinually passing between the commanders at
i I Cadi/, and lord St. Vincent, and a report
- Was prevalent in the fleet,nhat the guillo
tine has raised its direfulhead in sundry pla
ces of Spain;
; Cflober 3.
The Dutch papers to the 25th ult. state
1 that an oflenfivc and definitive alliance has
r been concluded between the Batavian RÂ«-
public and the court of Maffrid, on which
- they engage to ad in conceit dining the
2 prefen't war. The king of Spain, as a proof
r of his sincerity, has pmniifed, to indemnify
t the Dutch merchants for the detention of
- their (hips in the years 1,779, 80 a
e 1781.
> A Britifli veflel, the cargo of which was
valued at 60,0001. was lately seized on the
- Barbary coast by fix Portuguese, partof the
f crew, while the mailer prÂ«ceeded to Ceuta
- for provisions. They had taken shelter in
; one of the ports on that coast, but werepur
- sued, and probably ere this taken.
f The three Spsnifh Prelates who have
been so long upon a million at Dome, have
1 left that city, upon their returp to Madrid,
1 carry ing with them the fanftion ot his Holi
nffs for the reform of the Spanish Inquifitf
â  on, the reftri&ion upon religious foundati
â  ons, See. The Inquisition in Spain is uot
. totally abolished, as has been, reported.
Though in none of the papers
by the Triumvirs in order to fubdantiatc the
. charge of a Conspiracy, the least mention
is made either ofCarnot or Bsrthelemy, yet
1 it is easily conceived, how extremely impor
tant it was for the Triumvirate to get rid of
these two Directors.âBoth, and especially
Carnot,could not but be intimately acquainted
with the secret of the adtual Caufpiraey of
: the Triumvirs against the Legislative Body,
and of the measures planned for the dettruc
tion of the new Third. In order to blot
out every trace of the traiterous scheme,
nothing could be more convenient than to
murder one and to transport the other to a
distant country, in the paflage to which he
may perhaps find his death in some means or
other, in the manner of Carrier's downings
at Nantes.
In refpeft to the Fast of Carnot's afiafii
nation, whether by the hands ofÃarras, or
of two Myrmidons whom the Triumvirate
had placed in the Gallery of the Luxem
bourgh to do the deed, at hÂ« pasTed from the
Council chamber of the Directory, after re
fufing to give , his afTent to the plaa of the
late revolution, there is no doubtoffthe mur
der, nor of the person* who gave the order
for itâthe truth will come out. Carnot's
Brother is also fuppufed to have been afTaffi
nated..
This morning we received the Paris Jour
nals down to the 30th ult. of which the
following are the principal contents.
1 lie moll remarkable information in the
French papers, is the appearance of a coun
ter revolutioo in Poland, about to commence
under the auspices of Buonaparte. To that
effeft he has written to Count Potocki, for
merly anibaflador at Cendantinople from
Poland. The French General earneft'y so
licits the speedy assemblage of the Marshals
and Chiefs of the Diet of 1791 at Milan.
The exiled Poles, driven from their country
on account Â«f the lad infurreiSlion in Poland
and who have lately reiided in Paris, have
left the latter place, by invitation, for Ita
>y-
Odtober 4.
The latest advices from Admiral Duncans
fleet off the I exel, give the following infor
mation.â" By a Danish ship, which left the
Texcl yederday [Sept. 36], we have ob
tained ih formation, that in consequence of
lome serious misunderstanding between the
Dutch and French, the Dutch f Â»ilors had
lefufed to go to sea, when the Admiral
made the signal to weigh ; upon which most
of the officers had their baggage lent on
fliore ; and very soon after they followed it
{hemfelves. Their transports have been re
move 4 from the outward to the inner road,
and the troops are disembarked."
A young captain (of great military tal
ents, no doubt, though not quite twelve
years of age) was asked the other day, what
regiment he belonged to ? The of
light dragoons." " Are you sure you're
not miftaflen ?" said an elderly gentleman
in companyââ¢' I (hould rather suppose you
belong to the light Â«y"bÂ»<-ry !"
Madame Carnot, with her children, now
reside at the house of a relation near Arras.
We are intreated not to confound the
seducer of Miss King with'a gentleman who
is generally known by the name of Flying
Fitzgerald, and who wounded Harvey Al
ton in a duel about fix years, ago, in conse
quence of a dispute at Ranelagli.
Maj. Wood, who was second to the hon.
col. King in a late duel, is nearly related to
the fami y of lord Kingfborough.
Colonel Fitzgerald is half-brother to lady
Kingfborough. His father's second wife
was her ladyship's mother.
The unfortunate Miss K is describ
ed, by tbofe who are acquainted with her,
to be one of the fined young ladie&rin this
country.
A barpnet atithe we# end of the town
has, withitr these few days, been discovered
by his lady in an amour with .his cook.â
The enraged midrefs beat the peccant fair
t/.ie so fevercly with the heel of her shoe,
that it is supposed she will lose the fight of
one of her eyes.
Why Sir Benjamin Hammet should de
cline the honours of the civic chair, it is ra
ther puzzling to conjecture. Now that
certain parliamentary regulations have per
rnitted him to rcpofe from the endlcfs toil of
f:anting, surely the leisure he has been thus
indulged in, might as difni e r.dm!, be de
voted to feajling for the public good N6r
can we he induced to believe, as has beer,
nuliciou fly mfinuated, that his rehaance to.
enter ori the d'lties of the digeflive dire&or
fhip can poifihly arifr from any dread of iu
belrtg ihftng employment ; on the contra
ry, according to an experienced writer, he
will then be entitled, as alderman, especially
as city chief, to make a trade of his eating,
and, like a cock, to f?ape while he feed*.
The privateer L'lntrepide, belonging to

FOR THIS WEEK.
We have not been informed of any thing
remarkable, in the course of the present
week, in the interior of France. The Di
rectory mud, no doubt, be busily occupied
in filling up the vacancies occasioned by
their late violent proceedings in the Coun
cils. Indeed it mull, we are afraid, he a
long time before any tiling very remarkable
eau happen' in that humbled kingdom : in
which as complete a tyranny fcems, for the
present, te prevail as ever existed, and in
whieh the very voice of liberty is not heard.
The people, wearied of fruitlefs efforts for
the re (iorarion of tranquility, and afraid of
the Direftory, consults every one his own
fafety.âSuch are the fruits of jacobiaifm !
the innovations of vilionary politicians ! the
(ticklers for the rights, but the defpifers and
violators of all the duties of man !âThe
French revolution mult be allowed, at the
fame time, to be a warning to kings, as well
as to the people ; for altho' the prince on
whom the florin broke, had this world been
3 place for an equal diftnbutJon of .rewards
â andpunifhments, would have been secured
from such extreme calamities by the inno
cence of bis life, and the sincerity of his d-.-
votion ; the elements of that storm were
prepared for ages, in the opprefiion and the
profulion of his predecessors on the throne,
and in those unfortunate councils by which
he was, soon after the commencemeftt of his
reign, and without experience ofthe expence
of war and the inconltancy of affairs drawn
in to take a share in the contest between A
mevica and Great BritainâThe appearance
of Flags of Truce and frequent lieffrngers
from Fiance, with difpatchjs addrsfled, not
to lord Grenville, the miniller of this coun
try for foreign affairs,-but to Lord Malmef
bury, has been considered by some as an
indication, on the part of the Direaory,
as a disposition to Peace, and a wi.ih to re'
Hew, or rather to continue the negociation,
which, they think, has never been entirely
brojeen off. But to thitf conjecture we op
pose the aftual breaking up of the conferen
! ces at Lifie, and the interest of the present
rulers of France to carry on the fyitam of
war and plunderâto go on with pillage and
conquestâto make their neighbours pay for
the maintenance of armies, by which they
keep themselves in power, trample on their
own countrymen, and harrafs all the nati
ons around themâNothing new has tran
spired on the fide of Â«-
SPAIN and PORTUGAL;
nor yet have we been informed of what has
t iken place at Udlna, the feat of negociati
an inITALY,
f.t'ilier tlnn the greatest military prepsrlti-,
ot|S are still on foot on both fides. Buona
parte, who takes hi? aims from afar, and 13
subtle and profound in his. views, and in his
rcfources mol fertile and various, appears
to have had a design to amuse the enemy
by making a (hew of a wilh on his part and
an expedition of peace, while he seemed
anxious above all things to fettle his new
republics. The Emperor was not iitdeed
lulled into security ; but it will be difficult
to escape some snare that lies hid under the
open proceedings of the Italian, and not an
adventurer from another country. Two
circumftances,relativeto the probabledefighs
of Buonaparte, have lately drawn universal
attention. He humours, flatters, and courts
the
OTTOMAN COURT,
and he shews an intention of taking under
his prot'eftion the cause of the Polish na
tion. This is certainly placing France in the
Situation she was wont to fold in the chain
of. political powers ; the ally of the Turks,
and the Poles, united with the Turks in
hoftilit.y to Austria and Ruflia. But the
KING OF PRUSSIA,
is the tyrant of Poland, is the ally of France.
How is this majter to be arranged ? His
Pruflian Majesty is sick, and according to
all accounts, drawing near his end.
THE DUTCH SAILORS,
have lately, given a proof of their attach
ment to the Stadtholder in refuting to
weigh anchor and fail out of the harbour
under Admiral Winter. The cause of the
S-adtholder does not by any means appear
to 11s. to be desperate ; though it is better
to give way for a time, and wait far favor
able opportunities, thau to attempt any
fchemts for restoration by fafce of arms.
FRANKFORT, Sept. 16.
In the fair of this city, many French emi
grants of diftinclion kept (hops ; their com
modities were for the mod part, the produce
of their own industry.
ITALY, September 28.
The French have set up a printing press
on the island of Corfu.
At Genoa the ex-patrician Spinola, who
has been envoy at Paris and London, as also
Rivarola, who has been envoy in the latter
city, have been declared emigrants, arid
their effefts confiscated. The fame has
heen deereed at Venice against Morofini,
Jate infpeftor generalof the Venetian troops;
he has also been burned in effigy.
The famous Dondolo, an apothecary, it
gone to general Buonaparte at Udina, to
make some new proposition relative to Ve
nice.
The Neapolitan prince Paterno, who fail
ed from Sicily to Naples, in a (hip which
had above 200,000 ducats on board, in jew
els and valuable commodities, hat been taken
by a Tunisian corsair, and carried into
Tunis. The Neapolitan eonrt has dispatch
ed a courier to Constantinople on the oc
casion, and the Spanish envoy at Tunit has
taken the prince under his protection as a
grandee of Sp&in.
The pestilential distemper that prevails in
Corsica was brought by a Turkish ship that
was stranded on the island. Some of- the
people of the coast ran to pick up the goods
fromthe wreck, though the Turkscalled to
them that the plague was on board ; this,
however, did not restrain them, and the con
sequence was that joo persons died > n the
town of Murgo. A drift cordon is now
drawn xound theinfefted country.
MILA.N, September 9.
Though the German papers have dated that the
Imperial troops occupy the whole of Venetian Dal
mafia, it is certain that the nature of the cour.try,
anrtrhe of the inhabitants, oppose great
ohftacles to that invasion ; and admitting even the
supposition of peace, the pofleffion of thÂ« Auftri
ans will net remain long tranquil It cannot be
difiembied, th.it the new acquisitions of the house
âf ~a imift be of the greatest importance to
its commerce and its revenue ; and the inttreft
which it has in preserving them, and ittfuring their
peaceable enjoyment, inclines uÂ« to believe that! the
Ifmperor would not eipofe himfelf to the chances
of war, which cantlot but be disastrous to him.
The population of Iftria amounts at present to
no more than 140,0.: O ; but, under a good eov
ernmeni, it would soon increafeto half a million.
This province ha* about a dozen of potts, several
of which are much superior to that of Tried. The
ports of Rofla, Queto, and Pola, are capable of
containing the most considerable fleets, and the
fpil-jof the country is fufevptible of every species
of cultivation. The wines ai;d the oils of Iftria
have a great reputation.
VenetianDalmatia containsabout 3 o,o^oinha
bitants. Rara, SeVienifco, Spolatra, and Macarfea,
are the chief points of communication with Euro
pean Turkey, which supplies Dalmatia with pitch,
wax and wheat.
We have read with much plcafure the report
made by the committee of publicfafety to the pro
visional municipality of Venice, on the political
and commercial iituition of Venice, and which is
addrefled.to the Gifalpine republic, and to all the
French people of ItalyâThis report contains a
statement of the public debt, and the resources of
Venice ; presents a beautiful perfpe&ive of its ma
ritime power ; and finally demonstrates, under ev
ery relation, the utility of an union with the Cis
alpine republic.
General Buonaparte hai presented .100 mufquets
to the Venetian national guard. Venice, after the
example of Brescia, is about to form a regiment
r.f youths between twelve and fifteen years of age,
who, thus exercised during their infancy in the
prÂ»fcffion of ;rsrs, will acquire a taste for it, and
form a nursery of warriors disciplined, and capa
ble of being employed every where.
Tire French have reqeired of this country eight
millions of livres for the support of their army,
which sum wil! for the most part be levied on the
capitaiifts and the clergy. Our republic has raort
traced togesr al Buonaparte yearly half the Duchy
of Slantu-I, lying on the right tanks of the riv
ers Oglio and Po a part of Brcfcia, and some
valleys bordering on the 1 yrÂ®l. The -city and ior
trefj of Mantua is not, however, included.

BOSTON, December 2.
THE UNIVERSITY AT CAMBRIDGE,
Says a correspondent, is in a more fiourifh
ingifituation than at any period since its ex
ifience. The visiting committee from the |
board ofoverfeers hasfora considerable time
past exprefled their warm approbation of the
state of things in this important seminary.
It must be pleasing to the parents and friends
of these young gentlemen to hear that there
has not been a public censure passed on any
scholar for more than four years, con fequent
ly on none that is now in college.âlt is a
fadv that many of these young men have du
ring the pad feafon,-beenjfyÂ£ and tlx hours
in a day, either hear rig lectures from the
different profeffors, or vaptipg to their Tu
tors. There never was a period when there
existed a greater hafmouy between the gov
ernors and governed, between the teacher
and pupil. It is also a faft, which the whole
town of Cambridge can ttftify, that since
the bridges have been built over Charles-Ri
ver, there has been less noise and riot after
fun set about college, than ever was known
before. Tfie increased and still increasing
number of leftures seem to have opened new
profpcfts to these Undents, and to occupy
their minds so agreeably as to leave little
inclination for riot and disorder. It may be
said with tTuth,and therefore it ought la be 1
said, that the present set of students atCam
bridgeÂ«!o honor to themselves and to the
college.
PROVIDENCE, (R. I ) Dec. 2.
A letter has been received here from Mr.
William Magee, of this town, dated at sea
about 25 days since, which informs; that
the (hip Eliza, capt. William Page, of this
port had been attacked in the Streights of
Banca by a Prow, when capt. Page, Thor- i
as Page, seaman, and a Dutch Liaguift, ;
were unfortunately killed. By the bravery j
of the crew, the nativee were beat off, and
the Eliza had failed for Manilla.
NEW-YORK, December 8.
Carnot, it is said, informed Barthelemy,
on the 3d of September, of the scheme plot
ted by the Triumvirs to arrest them, and
proposed to prevent the execution of this
plan, by denouncing them to the couneils.
He took upon himfelf to cause the Trium
virs to be arretted that night for which pur
pose he had prepared every neoeffary mea
sure. Barthelemy more accustomed to the
quiet proceedings of diplomatic business,
than to the violent movements of the revolt
ution, could not convince himfelf of the
reality of the plot of the triumvirate, and
rejefted the proposed raeafure.
The French seem to have copied the Ro
mans, servilely and abjeftly, in retaining
many particulars in their new constitution,
which it was thought worth a revolution to
remove from the old; and leaving out the
good parts of their model, which made its
defeats less glaring, and compensated for
its want of perfeftiou in the whole. Like
the firft consuls, they have increased the
veftigalia of Tyan*y, and kept the insignia
of loyal power, but omitted to provide for
the exercise of religion, and forgot to be no
ble, generous, and magnanimous.
\_Ltnd. Pap.~\
The Abbe of Bologna lately preached a
sermon to the church of St. Roch, in which
he assured his congregation, " It was use
less for them to deceive themselves any lon
ger; and that the Catholic religion is in
compatible with a democratic government."
âThis is a new proof of the endless errors
into which they plunge themselves by fol
lowing theories. In the United States we
find that the Catholic religion harmonizes
as well with a republican government, as a
ny ether.
LONDON, Oftobei 6.
The Earl of Mornington embarks for Ben
gal on board La Virginie frigate, in which
also Sir JohnAnftruther takes his passage
la Virginie is expefted to touch at Madrafi,
in her way to Fort William.
Accounts from the Hague 'give the fol
lowing particulars of the late infurreftion in
the fleet in the Texel :âSeveral battalions
being sent oÂ» shore for their ill-behaviour,
admiral Winter sent fortheirofficerson board
his ship, and asked them whether they chose
to go to the Weft-Indies, or resign their
fituations<? Upon their asking if any order
existed for that end, and exprefiing their
willingness to obey it, the order was produ
ced and they were further enjoined to repre
sent the fame to the troops. Aecord
ingly, a Colonel went on board a trasf
port, which had two Companies ; but he
had scarcely time to inform them of the
order, when they fixed their bayonets,
firtd accused the Colonel of being the Au
thor, of the order. These two compa
nies were then sent on shore, where they
were difarraed by a body of Chasseurs ap
pointed to receive themâSix of the former
were seized by order of admiral Winter, and
ordered to be hanged up without any fur
ther process; the fentenee was immediately
executed upon two of tliem. Much doubt
was expressed refpefting the loyalty of those
forces which still lemaiiled on board the
(hips.
The Virginie frigate ready for sea in ev
ery refpefts, and will eertaitily, wind and
weather permitting, fail for Madras and
Bengal in the courl'e of next week.

S i A*
Among the papers lately read in congress
concerning Mr. Blount, there was one which
the fhort-haad writers have reported as"en
dorsed by Judge Turner." I feel it incum
bent on me to obftrve, that that paper was
altogether in Mr. Blount's hand writing. He
wrote it in ir.y prtfebce, tfrÂ»m aiifwcrs I
made to certain propounded.
It contained notes concerning Upper Lou
iiiaca, where I spent part of the winter of
1794-5. It will not be deemed requisite by
those who know me, to observe further,
that I was not aware, when those notes were
taken, of any improper use intended to be
made of them. I should readily have giv
en the fame information to any other person
profefiing, as Mr. Blount did, a desire to
collect fatks respeCting the interior of North
America.

MR. FENNO,
The publication from Alexandria of the
number of vefleli captured by the French
belonging to that town, is an example that
ought to be followed by all the sea-ports in
the United States. The annals of naval de
predations do not furnifh such instances of
outrage and lawless plunder, and this perpe
trated without the smallest pretextâpre
text did I fay ! the French government are
under the highest obligations to the people
and government of the United States. Ttuc
can be made to appear by a recital of fa&i
innumerable. The treatment we have re
ceived is a meft serious leflon to our coun
try j it fully proves that whatever men may
pretend, those who call themselves republi
cans, will prey on those who are really so,
whenever they have power so do it. The
magnitude of our lolTcs by the French ought
to be known. It will account for that dis
tress in which so great a number of persons
are involved at the present time. It will
serve to convince the people of this country,
who have been so often insulted with the
words national gratitude, that they mull look
to themselves and their own resources, for
justice and protection from lawless violence.

August, 179J:
Mr. Middleton, of Chefterfield-ftreet, St. Ma
ry-le-bone wasfo severely affli&ed with the Rheu
matic Gout, as to be unable to move in my bed for
fixmonths; his limbs were enormously fwelled,and
at length from exeeffive pain became quite black,
in this distressing situation he was induced to try
your Whitehead's EJfence of Mujiard; the Â£ffe& far
cxcaeded the most sanguine expectation, his pain
was immediately alleviated, and his limbs rsturnod
to their natural colour ; his,appetite restored, and
in a very Ihort time he waÂ» enabled to leave his bed
and walk with crytches; and by a few weeks per
severance, was completely restored to the full en
joyment of perfeft health.
Mr. Middleton, with his son. repeatedly
called as he got better, on Mr. Johnfton, an# de
clared that his life was utterly defpaircd of.
Refpe&ed Sir, Nov. 6. 1795.
Palling by a croud, in the fifth month of her
pregnancy, my wile received a dreadful blow on
her fide, which apparently destroyed the life of the
infant ; after the most Ikilful advice, and trying
various remedies for two months, Ihe still found
the symptoms increase to an alarming degree ; spit
ting of bloodâlhortnefs of breathâand other dif
agfeeahlfrcircumftapces appeared from so violent a
bmife, afforded only the fatal appearance ol her
speedy diffelution. A friend to whom I related
her fad cafe, having experienced great benefit from
your Whitehead's EJfence of Mujiard, kindly present
ed me with a bottle ; to my unspeakable fatisfac
tion, it fpedily relieved her from pain ; a lecond
bottle has removed every disagreeable symptom,
and with the most heartfelt gratitude I inform you,
we have tjie happy profpeil of her long continuing
a living mother to our numerous family.
