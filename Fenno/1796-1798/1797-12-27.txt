MR. FENJJp, W
Please to insert thdfolfowinjj in your use- t(
ful paper. It is an extraft of the Rev. Mr- f c
Backus'* fei-jno?> preached on the jd inft. at
Litchfield,, in Connsfticut, at the funeral of j B ,
that diftingvtiihed patriot and statesman, the t (
late GOVERNOR WOLCOTT- , ti
After giving the chara&pr of King Hee- n
ekhh in an elegant stile, the preacher pro- ' c <
ce-edsâ 'g
" How far any of these traits in the cha
rafter of good Hezekfah corresponded with
the'charafter of that venerable man whose ti
funeral obfequiej \Ve have this Jay aflembled y
to perform, the impartial public will now b
decide; sensible that the ei/logy which tx- n
ceeds general sentiment is not eulogy' but u
censure. I had rsfther fill (hoVt of a man's u
true meriti on foch an occasion thart be guil- ti
ty of fulfome panegyric. z,
Should it be said that oiir late dhirf ma- di
giftrate defcrves an application in many res- ti
pests of the charatter doW contemplated*, tÂ£
his enemies cannot fay it favors of iervile c ,
adulation ; it is a charafter of which
are unambitious, a charafter disgusting to ni
the taste of the age, not formed on the ruV- fc
ing principles of this world. A Jereboam a i
leading away a nation from ancient habits n;
and religious inftiti{tions, or a Jehv driving a i
furioufly, is more adapted to modern taste. vi
An Arifirides, a Numa Pompiliui, an Alfred h
and a Ma'nco Capac are forgotten {n the noise n
of a Pericles, a Sylla, a Mar'rns, Cataline or C
Cefar of later (Jays. But it is ltill a truth, h
that it ii more glorious to moralize and d
happify, than to render terrible afidto ag- ti
grahdize, a people. t!
By his death the slate is called to mourn fc
one of the real'friends df and t
purity of her ancient conftitutio*s. In the t
language of the prophet we may fay, that q
" one of the ffrong rods is broken and with- Â»
ered." from ancestors diftin- c!
guiftied among the firft settlers of New-Eug- j
Wolcott was a real, not a theo- t
relic republican. He referenced and era- I
braced the religion of his country. i
He was educated at Yale-C6ncs?> and ;
qualified himfelf for the profeflion of e
but being appointed (heriff of this county, <
Vie held that office J 4 years, when lie ivas <
elefted a member of- the couucil, and made i
a chief justice ofthecommon pleas, and judge I
<lf probates. In 1786 he was appointed j
lieutenant governor, and in May 1796, was (
promoted to the chief magistracy. He fil
led all his offices With uncommon dignity,. 1
â  During the struggle of the American revo- 1
lution that tfied men's fouls hf was the calm â¢
unlhaken friend of his country's catife. He
wa3 a member of that ever memorable 1
Congrefa which declared our independence ;
and in the. course of' the \rar repeatedly
marched at the head of large detachments
of the militia, as a general officer tÂ® repel
the invasions of the enemy.
In .the discharge of these several offices,
integrity and firmnefs were the leading fea
tures of his charafter.' He was an eminent
exemplification of .the virtenax propofiti* of
the bard of Venufia. Although'he poflefi"-
ed a strong mind, capable of deep and tho
rough investigation, his abilities were not of
that brilliant cast which have often ruined
men in popular governments. He always
seemed more desirous to do his duty than to
shine, to be ufeful than to dazxle. His nat
ural modeily, and, what is more, his un
blcmifhed integrity, led him to horrid con
ceptions of the arts of political demagogy,
the fin that so easily besets men in free go
vernments. He never Jlpoped to cayrl the
Suffrage of any man ; he blushed at the thp't
of being the man Â»f the people in the modern
finfe ; and to the honour of the ftatc it may
â¢ be said, the suggestions of malice have nf v
er ihaken their confidence in his integrity
and patrifctifm. By his death the true in
terests of feience have loft a strenuous de
fender ; virtue, religion, and good men a
sincere friend. He reverenced , and loved
public worlhip tnd divine ordinances ; was
t a tried, but not an ostentatious friend of
i the gospel ministry., He sensibly felt eve
s ry attempt to depart from the purity of
chriftiart practice and morals ; he set his fket
' lite a flint againfl all the fpeeious fophijlry of
r new political theories, and the madness if infidel
fanaticrfm. Rather than flatter of licence
r the vices of a community, like a popular
sycophant, he was willing to put his con
tinuance in office at hazard, and his reputa
tion in jeopardy, that he might discharge a
c good confeience,
c For several days before bis death the shat
tered remains of a once noble mind and vig
-1 gorous body were devoted continually, to
God ; his yery breath appeared to be pray
er. With all the splendor of Kis station and
of his well earn'd fame, he was not ashamed
>â¢ to pray in the expressive language of the
publican " God be merciful to me a linner;"
'â¢ until after many painful struggles he fell a
n flef P-
O death ! in what a mortifying light doth
thy power put the little, little glory of this
diminutive world. To what infignificahce
do human honors dwindle before the gran
deur cf Eternity !
Notwithstanding the death of such a cha
r rafter is a grievous loss, especially under
f. the present afpeft of divine providence, and
L t the perilous fituatiou of this country.
j Such tried charafters are " the fait ps the
K earth," the pillars of our national existence.
The presence, firmnefs, councils, prayers
and examples of such fathers should be ef
p, teemed " the chariots of our Israel and the
i, horfenen thereof."

" When Juflice calls, 'tis cruelty to fai'e." tl
The lefpitp oftbe execution of O'Hara, re
which i 3 probably intended as the prelude el
to his pardon, has excited the surprise, and h
, for myfelf lam not ashamed to fay, the in- le
dignaiion, of many citizens at good, as virtu- tl
i ous and a? humane, as those who have exer- a
. ted themselves to defeat the laws and jus
tice .of their country.âTo life the fenti- b
ments and I b.clieve the expressions of the w
court at t-Â»ie trial of O'Hara, he has been tl
guilty of, a most wanton and unprovoled o
murdfcr ; and 'twere is riot a onuhtry on b
gÂ«vkrned by latvs, where he would S
t)6f fnffetvthe punishment of death. And
ytt, in this country of rtforrnation, he is to tl
be turned again into society, washed by the ri
| magic operation as a pardon, at pure and y
unspotted in the eye of the law, as any of b
us, Â»nd entitled to as many privileges and an p
equal tank with the most meritorious citi- 6
ztn in the communityâThis too is to be
done, without a pretension that his convic- b
tion or sentence has been improper or mis- v
taken ; without a suggestion thait any oir- n
cumftances of palliation attended his offence o
or any discoveries in his favor have been f'
made since his trial. IÂ« this juAice, either t
by human or divine law ? Is it prudence i>
and policy ? Is it even benevoltnce or hu- r
manily ? I* it not rather mitdhefs, folly,
I and Cruelty to those who may be the future g
vitrims of the diabolical revenge of this vil- I
laiu ? For a mind more bent upon mifchief, J
[ more maliciously wicked and depraved than I
O'Hara's difcovtred itfelf in this business, t
has ferdom been exhibitedâls not fhis par- g
I don particularly dangerous and improper at t
I this 'time, when a man can scarcely walk
| the flreets without having a pistol placed at t
J his head, awd hi? pockets rifled ? What is i
I the lesson held outi in broad characters, to *i
I tbeffcruflrihs ? Simply thisâlf yon rob and Â«
I detedted, it is an heinous crime, sad you t
I will be .fewrely puaifhed : bat if you arc 1
j daring and wife enough to murder the man t
1 you have robbed, you not only quiet a ma- <
terial witnefe, tut if you should be detedted
jby any other means, you will escape with <
I impunity, by the food natvred infatuation of 1
la certain class of our citizensâDon't Ileal 1
I a (hilling or the vengeance of the law will
I overwhelm you, but add murder to the
I crime JUid you* escape is certain. We have,
in the abfurtl spirit of reformation, that now
seems to prevail, so inverted the order of
jfdicc and nature, tlv<t murder is the only
offence for which there is-oo punishment in
I PcnnfylvÂ»nia. I attended the trial of
O'Hara, and am acquainted with aIL the
evidence and circumstances of his cafe, and
will ventare to assert if he is an ehjedt de
fending of the executive interference, if the
course Â«f juflice and the law is to be arrett
ed for his), no cafe can poflibly happen or
be fupfofed in which the {punjfhment af
i signed bj law for murder should be inflidtcd
1 and confcqilently the law itfelf is' worthy of
I derision and contempt, and wijl soon meet
j -with it from rogues as well as from honed
â  | men-âLet the governor remember, that it
: is duty to adouiiifter the lawijnftly, im-

THE SHIP GRAND TUHK
' We have no doubt, from authentic infor
-1 mation received yesterday, is in at Town
? (hend, a harbour in tht diftriiS of Maine,
, having 9 fathoms of water, and fhehtred
> from all winds. When (he was spoken oh
WednefJay last, her situation. was not to
I diftrcHmg as reported. CÂ«pt.. Magee. writes
â  that they had caught a few dap befow^ac?
â  gallons of water; and that they then had 20
lbs. beef, and fo/ne biscuit. We feel they
â¢ mult have experienced many inconveniences
' from the fcngth of their passage; and the
â¢ perils of beating so long on our iron-bound
coast; But as there were plenty of tea and
spice, and probable, as /he touched at the
Manilla, sice on bo^rd: and as Captjtin
Powers supplied them with wine and rjufins,
we hope the fufferinga of the crew have
been exaggerated.
Many of the towns arc following the ex
ample of Alexandria, in publiihing accsuuts
of Spoliations by the beligerent powers. A
letter fromCuftine, in the Diftrid of Maine
informs, that the lodes of the Merchants
there have been 30,000 dollars by the
French, and 3000 by the Englilh; but none
of the latter fmee the treaty.
I.OSS OF BRITISH TRiqATE LA TRIBUNE.
Halifax, Nov. 24.
As p. melancholy contrail to the intelli
gence from Europe, -we are impelled, with
the utmost dillrcfs, to- state tile dreadful fate
of liis majesty's fliip 3Vib#(Â»e, of 44 guns,
commanded by capt. Barker. Thi* ship,
coming into the barber on Thbrfdiylaft,
struck on the fhoall off Thrumcap. The
tide being somewhat rebbed, evefy exertion
to relieve her proved ineffectual, and (he re
mained there until nef.r eleven the fame
night, previous to which time it blew a. vio
lent heavy gale nearly E. S. E. The guni,
except one for signals, and every other
weighty article, being thrown overboard,-
the (hip thus relieved, fleeted a little before
high water, when the gale blew strongest j
her rudder having-been knocked offâ~the
(hip leaking excelfively, and every thing in
the grealeft confufion, all attempt* to gain
the harbor were found impraÂ£ticahle->-at'
this dreadful moment lieutenants Campbell
and North, of the Fusiliers, who had been
on board to offer their afliftanee, quitted the
ship, intending to lay.under her lee and wait
the event ; but the sea ran too high to ad
mit of it. The (hip drifted direftly before
the wind until within a small distance of the
craggy fhorejuft below Pier ring-Cove, where
(he founderedâand, terrible te relate (ex
cept eleven seamen and marines, and one
petty officer) every foul on board hÂ«vÂ« pc

The number of men belonging to the
(hip is fitted to have been upwards of 240 ;

1 hey are aware that gentlemen are'unconfeioos
oV ftny wrong dene to tlie iniereft of-the inftitu
tifihby this practice, from a general, though mif
tiKSrt idea that Checks are the representatives of a '
right to Jo many feats in the Theatre, during an
Evening 4 * 6nteÂ»tainment, and transferable at will â¢
when in fa<s, they were never intended as more j
than toirns by which the Door-keepers are enabled
to afcettaia with the lead trouble to the/aÂ»-/;Â«,tlnt

paid for their admiflion.
Independent of the injury the Managers sustain,
such a praiftice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other disorderly parsons to surround the doors of
the I'heri-rc, to the corruption of their morals and
the great annoyance of the Audience.
It has also been the source of two evils of no in
confidcrable m-g&itudt; one is, that fomctimes
very inipropur company is by theft; mMm admit
