AN ENQUIRY
Concerning Political Justice,
And its Influence on Morals and Happiness,
By William Godwin.
THE reputation of this work is already well esta
blished in Europeâlt is hardly neceflary for an Ame
rican e litor to fay more than barely to mention, that
the Enquiry conternmg Political Juftite has ever
since its publication been a favorite performance with
the friends of republican government. The fli'e is
pure, nervous, and clafllcal; the ideas are strongly
marked by an original vein of thinking ; and, amonglt
a multitude of other just and striking pVffages, ; the
author's delineation of the peculiar infelicities insepa
rable from the condition of a King, may be pointed
out as a most masterly specimen of philosophical drf
quifition. The latest London edition of this work
fells in this city at four dollars and an half.

Letter to Mr. P'mcknej, Minifler Plenipotentiary qf
the United States to the French Republic.
' Continued.
7. " Notwithstanding the faith ef treaties, it gave
" an asylum to these fame EngliOi, who alter having J
" insulted her flag, pillaged her citizcns, eame alfoto
" brave the American people in their ports, and to !
"t-kei flation whence to cruise, 011 a favourable
" ciportumty, against the French."
This like mod other of Mr. Adet's charges, is bat
the renewal of the complaints of his predeeeilor, Air.
Fau&het, andthe vindication of the government, will '
appear in the answer and communication* from/tlie 1
Secretary of State to tha,t minilter, in the years 1794 j
and 179 ;. The cases particularly noticed were those
of the Britifli frigates Terpsichore anfl her prize la
Montagne ; and of tlie.Britilh Ihip Argonaut and her
prize L'EfperaÂ»ce. The Thetis and Hussar Britifli fri
gates with their French prizes la Prevoyance and la
Kaifon are also mentioned, but without any facls or cir
o.iiiftances as fubjeCU of which of course is
precluded. That of the Terpsichore ami her prize ap
pears to have been the firft cafe of the kind in which
the Executive of the United States and those of the
particular states were called te interfere ; and there
fore, it will not be thought extraardinary if the Exec
utive of Virginia was unprepared with arrangements to
give infyant effeiSt to the flipulation of the 17th article
of the trtatyof 1778, forbidding,an afy|um to the arm
ed veflels of the enemies of France and their prizes.
What delay took place seems to have been the result of
accident; certainly not of design. And by letters from
this department the Executives were garneftly prefled
to take the neceflary order for a prompt execution, in
future, of this part of the treaty. But why ihould
the French ministers complain with fu-.h energy, that a
-Britifli fhipof war, withhef prize, remained in one of our
ports during perhaps twenty or five and twenty days ;
when against the earnest rejjuefts and orders of the 1
Executive, the French privateers, armed in oÂ»r ports
in violation of the laws, Wg continued to keep on our
coast and enter our harbours, thence 011 favorable
opportunities, to ciuife against their en-mies? The
Columbia, or Carmagpole, continued such her unlawful
afls for more than a year.
After all the zealous remonflrances of Mr.'Fauehet,
row renewed by Mr. Adet, about the capture of the
French corvette L'Efperance, by the Briti/h (hip Argo
naut, who went with her prize into Lynn Haven Bay,
what were the fads 1 The Governor of Virginia went
personally to the French Consul at Norfolk fer infor
mation concerning this declared violation of the treaty
âbut " received none which appeared to juflify the
" uneafmefs eccafioned by that event, he charging no
" circumjiance at improper in the captors but rather
" fcemed to consider the introduction of the prisoners
" made 1 on that occasion, so soon into a place where
"the exchange would be effefled, as an alleviation or
â " the misfortunfc of lofi!!g the veflel." The Captain
of the French corvette himft If wasdefircl to give evi
dence in the cafe ; he promised hut failed to" appear.
He was called upon the fccond time to give informa
tion, but discovered an unwillingness to do it, observ
ing that he had given the Consul a circumstantial ac
count of the tranfadfion oa his arrival, The governor
having heard that a refpcftable pilot by the name of
Butler was acquainied with the circumstances of this
affair, ne directed hisdepofition to be taken: it was
taken and imported that Admiral Murray himfelf
purchased the prize L'lfperance, and manned and fit
ted her in Lynn Haven Bay for a cruise. But Butler's
deposition was afterwards taken on the part of the
Britifli, in which he contradided all the material fa<fts
recited in the former deposition ; for which he ac
counted by faying that he could neither write nor read,
and that there had been inserted in his firft deposition
wJiat he had never said. Under these circumstances it
was desirable to o'.itain further information. This was
furnifhed by the Britilh miaiflerin the extr-i<Sl of a let
ter from Admiral Murray, which bears every mark of
candour and humanity, and of refpeft for the United
States. It is as follows.
" The#French (loop of war L'Efperance was
Â« brought into Lynn Haven Bay on the nth of
Â«< Jannary (a few days after my arrival there) by
f captain Ball, who had captured her ij leagues
Â«Â« from the shore, the weather being very pnpef
<Â« tuoas, a lieutenant with a fufficient miml er of
Â«Â« men only to navigate her (not being half the
Â«Â« complement the French had in her) w te sent
â¢Â« on board from the Resolution and Argonaut ;
'â¢ and so soon as the weather permitted these ships
" to supply her with water and provisions, I sent |
" her to sea, that I might give nu umbrage to the <
Â» American states. An additional reason for !
Â«< bringing L'Efperance into Lynn Haven Bay '
Â« was out of humanity to the French prifuiurs, I
" whem, having had a long voyage. I sent te 1
" Norfolk as soon as would permit : '
" otherwise they must have been kept prisoners on '
Â«â  board the whole wintei.and sent to Halifax in '

If among the multitude of such complaints as
M r - Adet has exhibited, any ene could excite fur
ptife, this chatge is calculated to r, â¢ duce it. Here
a formal charge is made again!} the government of
the Uni'-ed States, that it did not control, in ano
ther Independent nation, the right of judging of its
own affairsâthat it did not forbid and efft'anally
prevent the officers of a foreign power, the Britifli
admirals and commanders, in the Weft-Indies, de
elaiing certain Frenth colonies to be in a state of
blockade! â" But the official legalization of a
" a proclamation had been palled up under eur
" eyes, prohibiting pur commerce with the French : n
" colonies, and fafpendirg us alone the law of c
" nations! The anfoer to Mr. Fauche , frum the
secretary of state, reprcfents this matter differently. Â«
The Britifli consul general at Philadelphia, by a
a publication of the loth of April 1795, g av e no- d
ticfc that he had received t.ffi, ial communications a
that the ifiands of Guadalaupe, Marigalente and
Defirade, were by proclamaiian issued by hit Bii
tannic m:jclly's general and vice-admiral command
ing in the Weft Indies, declaied to be in an aflual
state of blockade; and that neutral (sot singly P
Amer'uan) vefTcT-., were prohibited' frcirr
attemptjng to enter any ports or places in those
iflanda with supplies of any ki;id. under the penalty
of being I' dealt with conformably to exilling trea
" ties, and as warranted by the eftabhlhed laws of
r " nations." And while exitting treatie* (0111
treaty with Great Britain had no eperative cxift- (
ifter.ee till fix months after the consul's advertise
. mcnt) and the lavvs of nations were avowed to be
. j the rules by which the property of neutrals was in
> : this safe to be adjudged, had they reason t# torn
-1 ; plain ? If any neutral veflels attempted to enter any
- of those ports which were not in reality in a state
ef blockade, and yet were captured, could they be
condemned ? Certainly not by the rules which the
I Britilh prescribed to themselves " treaties and thÂ«
c 1 " laws of nations ' But if the Britifli commanders
4 proclaimed untruths, and issued arbitiary orders far
- capturisg neutral veflels ; and their cruisers aud
1 courts of admirality executed them arbitrarily ;
1 could the American government pteyent them ?
a We coulJ demand of the Britilh government satis
. fatlion for injuries to eur own citizens consequent
s on such orders : and if any such were fultained, the
- arrangements for making reparation are now in
h execution. But admitting that any ports in the
e French colonies were in fadl blockaded ; who should
notify it to neutral nations accuftcmcd to trade
j with those ports ? Certainly the officers of that
e power whose fleets and armies formed the blockade:
- and in the United States no mode of giving univer
1. sal notice could be so effectual as a publication in
f hand-bills and newspapers.
| gth. "It eluded all the advances made by the
" republic for renewing the treaties of commerce
j " upon a more farorable footing to both nations;
j " it axcufed itfelf on the most frivolous pretexts ;
r " whilst it anticipated Great-Britain, by soliciting
; " a treaty in which prostituting its neutrality, it
2 " facrificed France to her enemies; or rather loek
-5 " ing upon her as obliterated from the map of the
Â£ " world; it forgot the services the had rendered it,
. " and threwafide the duty of gratitude, as if in
1 " gia'ittide were a government duty."
Or the advances referred to, the firft were made
, by Mr. Genet. These yau will fee in tiie printed
between him and Mr. Jeffcrfon.
Mr. Genet's letter is dated the 23d.ofMay, 1793,
in which he informed the government that he was
authorized to propofc a treaty on a " liberal and
" fraternal bafts." Mr. Jefferfon's letter to Mr.
Morris, our minister at Paris, dated the 23d of
Augutt, 1793, affigna the reason for postponing
the negociation. 4-" The senate (fays he) being
" then in recess, and not to meet again till the
" fall, I appiifed Mr. Genet that the participation
" in matters of treaty, given by the constitution
" to that branch of our government, would of
" courft delay any dejimlivc answer to his friendly
" prnpofition. *Ai he was fenCble of this eircum
" stance, the matter has been understood ta lie
" over till the meeting of the senate." Congress
were not to meet until December; consequently
there was no neceflity of precipitating the business.
But with the bell dispositions to form new commei- 1
cial arrangementsmutually moreoeneiidalthan those
ofthetreaty of 1778, the unwarrantable conduct of
Mr. Genet, from the momenthelanded at Charleston
until the date of his letter on the fubjeft of the
negociatian, was fufficient to excite caution in the
American government. He had there violated the
fevereignty of the United States. " By autho
" rizingthe fitting and aiming of veffcls in that
" port, enlisting msn, citizens and
â  '' g' v 'Â»g them commissions to cruize and cftmmit
" hoftilitie4.on nations at peace with and
with whom we had extensive commercial connec
tions. These privateers were taking and bring
" ing prizes into our ports, and the cenfuls of
" France were assuming to hold courts of admi
" rnityon them, to try, condemn and authorize
" their as legal prize." Nevertheless, the go"-
vernment really drfirous of forming a new and
more advantageous commercial treaty tvith France,
inftruAed the minitterof the United States at Pa
ris to nianifeft the fame to the executive of
acid to suggest for this purpose that ti>c. powers of
I Mr. Genet be renewed to his fucceffer. It is true
â¢ that in his letter, dated the 30th of September,
| Mr. Genet had renewed the propofi ion of nego
tiating a eommertoal treaty ; but how was it pof
fihle for the government to undertake a negocia
tion with that minister after The correspondence
" -which had taken place between the executive
aRd him" (a correlpondence on his part replete
with insults " and the ails which he had thought
" proper to do and to countenance in oppefttion to
" the laws of the {'land?" After the government
had infttuficd our minister at Paris to desire Mr.
Genet's recal; aid to declare to the government
of France " The neceflity of their having a re
, " prefentative heredifpofed to refpeft the laws and
" authority of the country, an 3 to do the best far
" their inteteft which theie would permit :" " and
" when it was only-an anxious regard for those
" interests, and a desire that they might not fuf
" fer, which induced the executive in the mean
" time to receive his communications in writing,
" and to admit the continuance of his fuiiilions so
" long as they (hould br restrained within the li
" mits oftltelaw,as theretofore announced to him,
" or fliould be of the tenor usually observed to.
" wards independent nations by the representative
" of a friendly power residing with them !'* Un
der such circumstances what answer could the exe
cutive return to Mr. Genet more proper, and more
marked with attention to Fiance, than that his let
ter " would be considered' with all the refpeft and
" interest which il# otjefl necessarily requirefl i"
It is probable that the powers to negociate a
commercial treaty were not renewed to Mr. Ge- 1
net's fucceffur ; certainly they were not communt- 1
cated to our government. ' * 1
We now come to the frefh overtures of a com
mercial negociation made by Mr. Adet.
1 he firft notices of them arc found in memoran
da of fa<3* dated the 27th and 29th of June 179J, i
and fubferibed by the secretary of state. By these 1

S Stat: papers, p. 68,
it appears, that or the 13th of June Mr, Adet ar
lived at Philadelphia. On the 15th Mr. Fattfhet
introduced-him to the fecietary of state; âon the
16th Mr. Adet informed the fectetary that he
fhauld the next day fend him some aft of the French
government, relative to commerce : but it was not
sent. On the 2zd of June Mr. Adet was remind
ed of the pramifed communication. He said it
was copying, and gave reason to suppose that he
Ihould forwaid it on that day : but on that day
nothing was received.
On the 29th of June 1795 Mr. Adet had an
interview with the secretary of state : He observed
that he brought with him the commercial decrees
which Mr. Genet had formerly propounded to our
government, and was inttrudted to negociatu a trea
ty of commerce upon their basis. He was asked
whether he had any documents to communicate.
He replied that he would fend them that day. He
said lie had to communicate some inquietudes re
-1 fpt sting the late treaty between the United States
and Great-Britain. He obtCVved that it was un
derstood, that the United States had disabled them
selves from entering into a new commercial triaty
1 upon a liberal scale with France. The secretary
answered that he had determined before he came,
ta ask the peimiffion of the President to communi
cate to him a copy of the treaty; and then he
might fay in what part he supposed that any im
! propriety with refpedl to France exilled. The
President having afterwards affentcd, the secretary
on the fame day delivered to Mr. Adet a printed
copy of the treaty ou which he promised to com
municate his remarks.
These remarks dated June 30th, and the Secre
tary's answer dated July 6th, refuting the objeiSti
ons they contained, I have already noticed. The
subsequent preceedings will {how either that those
ohjeftions did not make any strong impressions on
Mr. Adet's mind, or that the Secretaiy's answer
had removed them.
On the 30th June 1795, Mr. Adet communica
ted a part of his inftrudions relative to " a Hew
" commercial treaty and a new confalar Conventi
" on to be entered into between Fiance and the
" United States." The inltrudtions imported that
he was only to " prepare with the American go
" vernment the means and arrangements" of these
treaties, and then to communicate them to the
committee of Public Safety. The object of the
new treaty was declared to be "to found the com
" mercial relatione of the two republics upon fti
" pulations more reciprocally advantageous, and
" more clearly worded than that of 1778, and the
" obj.*dt of the Consular Convention to secure the
" execu'ion of the commercial treaty."
The secretary of state answered on the ift of Ju
ly exprtfllng the readiness of the government to
open the proposed negotiation ; and requested a
communication of the dates of the decrees to which
Mr. Adet's inftru&ian referred.
On the Bth of July 1795, Mr. Adet replied to
the secretary of state " that he neither knew nor
" pofTefled any other decree relative to the new ne
" gstiat'on to be opened between France and the
" United States than that of the * sth of Febrn
"aT '793' communicated to us by Citizen Ge
" net." Tiiis letter of the Bth was received the
I 2th accompanied by a note of the latter date apo
logizing for the delay on account of fickfcefs. On
I the I 2th the secretary of state had written to him,
prejjing him on the fubjtift of the new negotiation.
On the 161U of July I 795, the secretary of state
again wrote to Mr. Adet ; and after informing
him that as he was not clothed with any very for
mal authority upon this fubjeft, the President of
the United States had thought proper to place him
(the Secretary, of State) upon the fame & no other
footing,â-the secretary proposed that the negotia
tion should be conducted in wiiting, unless when
either thought it expedient to have an interview OVI
any particular difficulty. And then assuring Mr.
Adet that no unnecttfiiy procrastination (hould be
found in the secretary of state, further proposed,
that Mr. Adet should state ift the parts of the
tteaty which he wished to be abolilhed : id, those
parts which he wished to be cÂ«>rre&edand 3d, any
additions which seemed to him defirallr : But ex
piefled the readiness of the secretary to adopt any
other better mode of conducing the negotiation,
if fudh occurted to Mr. Adet.
On the 20th of July 1795, Mr. Adet mention.
ing his sickness which for fifteen days had obliged
him to abstain from business, replied on the fubjeft
of the negotiation in these words <Â« In a few days
" I ftiall have the honor of feeing you, and of ta
" king the neeeflaip meafurcs in order to com
" nience the business relative to the'digefting of
" the new treaty and new Consular Convention."
From this detail, it must I conceivc be no easy
talk to find aay facts by which Mr. Adet's chatVe
can be supported. What ".ie afFedb ta call " frivo
lous pretexts'' are fubflantial reasons ; and in res
pedl to his own advances to treat, the condufl of
our government manifefts an eagerness to enter on
the negotiation : certainly you will discover in it
no disposition to elude or to procrastinate.
You will be pleased to observe, fir, that the let
ter from the secretary of state to Mr. Adet, ex
plaining the manner in which they should proceed
in the negotiation is dated the 16th of July and
that Mr. Adet's answer agreeing shortly to meet
ihe secretary, in order to take the necefTary mea
futes for commencing the business is dated the 20th
of July ; yet in his note of November 15th 1796,
alter having charged the government of the Uni
ted States. 'â¢ With eluding all advances made by
" the republic for renewing the treaties or cora
" merce and excusing itfelf on the molt frivolous
" pretexts," after acknowledging thgt the Prefi
dei t had authorized the secretary of. state te nego
tiate, and that the latter had explained the manner
of preceeding, he asks " But at what time ? When
" the ratification ef the tteaty concluded between
.Lord Grenville and Mr. Jay no longer permitted
" the to pursue that negotiation." I
am forty fir, in this place to call your attention to
dates. The Britilh treaty was not ratified until
the 14th of August 1795, that is about a month
after the plan ef negotiating with Mr. Adet had
* Mr Adet h?.i since corrected this date, the decree
intended being dated February 19,1793. â¢ 1 his is already
publifhcd witi the State paper* ef taat year, page 15.
been propofed.tn birr by flic fr letaryof flair, and
twenty-five days'aitei lie bati i,p proceed uÂ»
it. And if that ratification finally induced him to
abandon the idea of negotiating anew treaty he.
tween France and ihe United Stales, it did nci in.
flantly produce this determination. He doul.rhfs
perceived that his own obje&ions to the British
tieaty were obviated by the answer from the fecre-
(late,and when he acknowledged the receipt
of it, be had given up the right of judging of the
treaty, whether it was good or bad I fhaU (fays he,
in his letter of July 20th 1795) " transmit it (the
Â«i fecrerary's answer) to the French government
" together with my observations and the treaty.
" In fucb important circumftanees, it is exclufivdy
" the ijroviuce of my government to judge ; and
" I csnnot permit myfelf to decide at all." And
then immediately addsây In" a few days [ fhs 1
" have the honor of feeing you, and of taking the
" necelTary measures in order to commence the bu
" finefi relative to the diverting of the new tieaty
" and new Consular Convention." The British
treaty then did not obftr\i6t the negotiation, the
principles of which might have been agreed on,
and the articles drawn into form to be fubmitud to
the refpeftixe,governments : for that was allnhfe
refpeÂ£tive negotiators were authorized to do.
Will the minilteir of the French republic never
cease to Reproach us with " ingratitude >" If, in.
deed, " France wrought" a 6 well i "guaranteed
" the independence of the United States," as Mr.
Adet asserts, "at a time when (he nÂ»iÂ»h', as the
" price of that very indeptndence, have granted
" them lefj liberal condi'ions," our oldigario, arc
greater than wehavehithertoimagined. Eu'it is time
that these claims to our giatitude were iivclligated,
and iheir extent ascertained. We have citizens yet
alive who were actors and witnesses of the declara
tion of our independence, and of the efforts to main,
tain it, with their effefls, prior to our treaty with
France. But laying no (tiefsdn our own recollec.
tions or consciousness, we will icfort to the telti
meny of France herfelf.
France, by her minister the marquis deNoaillej,
having, in the declaration of the 1 jth of March
1778, which I have already quoted, announ edto
the court of London, the treaty ofy filendfhip and
commerce (he had formed with the United States ;
and that to maintain the commerce of bis fii! jefls
with them, which was the objett of that tieaty, his
mod Chriflfan majedy had " takep.eventual mea
" fures in concert with the United States of North
" America that court publittjed a jullificative
memorial to vindicate to the war (he had
determined to wage agamft France. In the ob
servations of the eoutt of France on this Brit
memorial, we find the following declarations on the
part of Fiance, " * While the amkaflador of Eng
" land put the king's pp.tience ta the ftipngeft
" proots, and while the court of London was con.
" ftaatly repeating denials ofjuftiee to his majffty's
" fabjefls, at the fame time.that the British officers
" continued to desolate them on the sea, an eytnt
" came to pals in America, which eflcntially
" changed the face of things in that quarter of the
" world. This event was the defeat of the army
" under general Burgoyne. The news of this un
" expe&ed disaster, which arrived in Europe, in
" November 1777,aftonilhed the British ministers,
" and mud have the more sensibly affe&ed them,
" as it overthrew the plan they had laid for the re
'â  duSion of the colonies." The observations then
fugged that this great event induced, in the British
cabinet, the idea of conciliation with America,
and of a coalition against the crown of France, in
revenge for the fnppofed aid rendered, by her, to
the United States ; and to gratify " their mod
dear and conltant wi(hâthat of humbling
" fit was natural for the British miniltry unable
" to fuldue her colonies, to seek ta be reconciled to
" them, and to engage them to espouse her re
" fentment. They so much the more flat
" ter themselves that they should fticcced herein,
" as the proceedings of France with regard to
" American privateers, and especially the dijlike the
" king had et ail times mar.ifcjled to any engagement
" with the Cangrfs, mud have given difgult and
" dtfTstisfadtion to their deputies, and indue tjjem,
" notwithstanding thrir well 'known averfloo, ta
" seek even in England, the fafety of country
" when they failed to find it in France."
f " The king, well informed of the plan of the
" court of London, and of the preparations which
" *"e"re the confequenee of it, perceived that no
" mote time was to be loft, if he would prevent
" the designs of his enemies: His majesty deter
mined, therefore, to take into consideration, at
" length, the overtures of the Cong-refs."
Â§ " The Cominiflioners [from the United StatesJ
" propoftd to the King a Treaty of Amity and Com
" mer6e, and an alliance offenfive and defenfive, by
" which his Majesty ihoukl engage not only to ackriow.
â¢' ledge (imply and purely the Independence of the Uni
" ted Stitei, but also to guaranty and defend it by
" force of arms. Ihe King ordered an answer to be
" given that he could indeed look upon the Indepen.
" dence of the United States m exifling ; but that it
" did not belong to him to acknowledge it, becauft he
" had not any right to judge 6f it; neithtr rotild
" guaranty it, as he did not intend to enter into ivarfor '
" its support. His majesty in tonfequence refufed an
" offenfive alliance, and confined himfelf to th: Treaty
""f -Amity and Commerce. But as it was more than
<Â£ probable that the eowrt of London HAD formed a de.
" Jign of attacking France His majesty thought" he
'' ought to enter into an alliance with the United States
11 E-ventual and" purely DefenfS've. The llipulatjons
" contained in this second treaty are in substance, thit;
" // France fJmuld be attaacked by the Court of Lo'n.

the old artillery was drawn up, the compliment was
Tepeated. The (hips at the wharves were throng.
Â«d, from which frequeut huzzas were reiterated.
Mr. Pinckney was landed with his family at
Blake's wharf. The carriages waiting for them
were nofooner noticed than (he jmpulfe of the mo

fail to be gratifying. The horses were taken off,
and the carriage for his reception wade ready to be
drawn by the throng, when it appeared that Mr.
Jinckney, taking advantage of the delay, ocrafi

It has been repeatedly said that the Spanilh ves
sels take American. We tlÂ» not believe it. Spain
is on friendly terms with the United States. The
truth doubtless is, that the French do much as they
please in Spaiaifti ports in the Weft-lnaies, as they
do ;n Italy. They take and condemn American
vefleis. It will be recollected that the treaty be
tween France and Spain, jho offenfive and defen
five, is foonly in regard to certain powersâit does
not require Spain to wage wai with every power at
war with France. It does not require Spain to be
at war with the United States, even though France
fhou'id engage in hostilities with us. This, as far as
our recolle&ion extends, is the fatt in regard to that
treaty ; and it precludes all doijbt 011 the fubjeft of
a war with Spain.
Fifty-eight fail of American vefleis arc seized and
carried into Gonaives by French crnilers We nn
derftand the Bntifh (hips at Port au-Prince protest
the Araeiican trade, and often convoy American
vefleis out of the reach of the French cruisers.
The last fentenceof the Prelidents meflage to
the haufe of representatives, accompanying the do
cuments relative to P'rench affairs; is remarkable and
deserves notice. After aflignirig his motives for
fending Mr Pinckney, mimfter to Fra'nce, he*fays,
" a government which required only a knowledge
of the truth to juftify its raeafure3, could not but
be anxious to have this, fully and frankly displayed."
That cautious officer, the President, would not
have let such an exprellion fill from his pen; with
out fatisfaftory evidence, that some persons, hollile
to our government, have been attempting to mislead
the French Directory.
The merchants in Philadelphia have petitioned
the lej;iflature for a law 10 nnake notes of hand ne
gotiable. All the banks have also sent in petitions
foi the fame purpefe.
Mr. Lcib moved 111 the legifla'.ure to introduce
a claufe'into the bill for making notes negotiable,
prohibiting the taking more than one half percent,
a month for difceunting notes. Referred to a com
mittee of five.
It is aftonifliing, at this period of the wo ld,
that such prohibitions can have advocates. The
way, and weafTert; the only way to prevent the
mouftrous premiums now paid for money, and
which draw all the spare money of the
â¢country trum regular bufiriefs into fjolijh prsjeits,
is to refill all such prohibitions. A limit all re
paints on the nfe of moltey, and the common rate
of interest will not remain eighteen months above
5 per cent What did a!> America fay of the sol-
Iv o i regulating prices during the war ? Fnrtunare
iy the laws were soon violated, or we {hould alt*
have perilhed with cold and hunger France had
recourse to the fame (illy projeift in tbeirlaw of the
maximum and that far enforcing the circulation of
affignatj. The consequence of these laws wat, u
nivcrfal want and dijlrefs. France was upon the
verge of a famine. Th? cause waÂ» difceveredâ
the regulating lawi repealed, and France was abun
dantly supplied.
The laws againlt usury in this country, are the
principal cause of high interefi. They create the
very evil intended to be remedied.
When powder was scarce, during our war, the
flatei did nor fix the priceâthey bid a bounty. Im
mediaiely mills were built, and vefTels loaded wilh
powder, entered our ports. Powdei was as cheap
as ever.
In regard to money, people, who want it, bid
the bounty. Legiftatutet have nothing to do, but
te let it alone.
We understand the sales of land, by the United
States, have produced about 60,000 dollars.

this estate, a large and well built - brick house, contain nÂ£
nine commodious rooms, cxclufiveof a spacious hall or en

ient piffaget, and excellent dry cellars. It is placed on a
fine herdthv eminence, commanding beautiful views in
every direction over the towns of Frederickfburgh and
Falmouth, and an extensive country.âThe
grounds adjoining the house are "neatly laid out in pieaf
ure -end kitchen gardens interspersed with a variety of
fcaree trees, achoicc colle&ion of flowers aHd flowering
shrubs, and enriched by various ibrts of the following
fruits, viz apples, pears, walnuts, chefnuts, ehe'rries,pcach
, eÂ«, plumbs, nediarines, apricots, grapes, figs, rafberries,
gooseberries, ftrawberries,and currants; the whele admi
rably varied by-turfed fl*pes wll4ch have been formed by
great labour ana expence. Bordering upÂ»n these im
provements, are several lots, in a highftate of .cultivation,
and well set with red clover and orchard graft, from
which three heavy erops of hay are taken every year. Ad
' jacent thereto are two large and flouriftiing orchards; one
of well chosen peach trees, the other of apple and pear
trees, fele&edfrom the belt nurseries in the {late. Pro
perly detached from the mansion house are extensive
roomy offices of every denomination, viz a Kitchen and
harder, house-keeper's room and Laundry, with a cellar
- underneath for a variety of purposes, a ftore-toufe and
[ smoke houfc all of brick, a dairy and spring house of ftonc.
, Stables for thirty horses, anÂ«l coach houses for four car
riages. Also a large and well planned farm yard, m ith
barn and granary, a cow house, wit>h separate stalls for
( thirty-fix grown cattle; apartments for fattening veals,
muttons and lambs extensive sheds for sheep, and other
arrangements for stock of every description, with a large
and convenient receptabie for provender, from which they
can'be furnifhed without being exposed to the inclemency
of the weather. An overseer's house, blacksmith's fliop,
and quarters fufficient to accommodate in the best man
ner more than fifty labourers.
The arable lands are fÂ® advaptageoufly divided as to af
ford an opportunity of making a large quantity of Indian
(Corn annually, without bringing the field into similar cuU
tare oftrier than once in four years; consequently the
lands may be improved by keeping up the inclofures during
the intermediate years, or may be beneficially fallowed for
wheat and other grain at the option of the proprietor.
On the premjfes there is also a merchant mill with one
pair of best French burr f tones, and one pair of Cologne;
furnifhed with modern machinery, and now leafed for the
unexpired term oi four years, at 1501 per annum, and all
grain for the use of the farm, hopper free, which is near
ly 1 001. more. The mill and miller's house are built of
free stone, within a very small distance of navigation, near
to which are two or more valuable lifheries, and a well
accustomed ferry over the Rappahannock to the town of
Frederickfburg. The land contains inexhaustible quarries
of free stone near to the river, is plentifully supplied with
remarkable fine water and poUeffes a due proportion of
meadow, which the command of water may
be conliderably increafcd. The roads are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel andfociable. Infant, exclullvc of
an improveable and well condit ; oned farm, the value and
emolument inseparably conae&cd witn a mill, ferries,
fiiheries and queries eligibly situated ; the profits ariÂ£ng
from an ice-house inferior to none in the ftatc, and a gar
den of four acres so abundantly stocked with vegetables
j ofjail forts as to fully equal to the demand in market,
th-re might be detailed many other advantages, apper
taining to the fertility of these lands, which the fubferiber
conceives it nnneceffary to mention, being fully convinced
thr.t when examined, it will be found to be a complete,
pleasant and healthy refiddnce, possessing beauties and
conveniences fufficient to attra&the attention of any per
son defireusof becoming apurchafer. 1
The motive/which induces the fubferiber to offer for
sale an eftatefo Angularly beautiful and advantageous, is
a riefire to become an inhabitant of Alexandria, where he
can with more ease attend to his infcerefts in the neigh
bourhood of that city
The pnrchafer may be aeeommodatedwith a few slaves
in families, either for plantation or domestic use. A part
of the purchafc money will be required and the balance
made easy, the debt being properly secured.
