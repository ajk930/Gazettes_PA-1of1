JIKMJJIKS.
Truth begins to appear ; already in the '
above work has she broken her chains and 1
begun to tear off the veil from the ciious 1
of the Jacobins, and to expose them to the i
view of the .world in all their horrid defor- 1
mity. France is expressing the (hnrne it 1
feels in haVing givep birth to such monllers (
and in fuffering so long a time the scourge
infiifted on her by him.,. Americans fym- 1
pÂ»ilfaized with France in her struggles a- r
gainst the combination against her; the t
freedom of the press being totally desTroy- t
cd, and, the tlirt&wa and controul 1
1- jof the party dominant, oh tins fide
\ the Atlantic, were ignorant to -What extent
y j the honors of the Jacobins extended. Lit
e tie did we think, that REGULATED
t i LIBERTY, that firft idul of our hearts,
- that objedt dearer to us than life, and with
>- ; out which life itfelf is, a burden, was daily
f- | bathed and almost drowned in the blood of
e her most virtuous and zealous worshippers
11 by hypoerites abusing and adling in her
nameâNow that we know the truth,
1- ought not such among us who have advo
cated every measure adopted by the different
9 fa&ioas, who have governed France for
e eight years pas!, candidly to confefs that
s they had not till now the most distant idea
r of the exceffe6 to which things were cSr
;l lied, and of the danger to which CIVIL
t LIBERTY was exposed in creating an
y sbhorrence to it among the French them
j selves ? Ought not our " exclusive patri
-8 join the French people in execrat
n iri{( the raonfters, who have tyranized over
- France and drenched her in the blood of
e her bed citizens ? Ought they not particu
e larly to Join the Legijlativc Body in con
i demning the conduit of the jacobinic Di
e re&ory> with rofpect to their treatment of
t this country ? JTo, my fellow citizens, we
1 have fiends among us, who, with patricidal
s look and fatarrnic grin, have expressed satis
- fadtion at all the losses we have sustained
i from fm arbitrary, villainous order of the
'â  Executive of a foreign nation, which the
s people of that country have themselves
s pointedly called a piratical decree."
Let no fueh men be trusted either in
, public or private lifeâthey are not radical
- ly found. It is remarkable that not an
: American privateerfman in France, not a
: traitor who has been in public office and
- betrayed and attempted to betray the in
- terefts of his country, but what has befcn
- a diforganizer, an enemy to our national
e jrovrnmentâto virtuous Federalists
- who have administered it, and adtive .pro
t naoters arid insolent approvers of French de
. prtdatio*s on our property. On the conÂ»
e trary, I defy our Jacobins to produce a fin
e's friend to our federal conflitution and
c its hitherto virtuous adminiflration, who
- has been concerned diredtly or indirectly in
1 privateering under French colours agatnft
: their countrymen, or who has abdfed the
sacred trull reposed in them as public offi
- ceri. N No, my fellow countrymen, you
1 j will find privateerfmen and traitors only
- among the " EXCLUSIVE PATRI
-1 OTS," the revilers of Washington, Adams,
' and fomÂ« other real friends to their country
1 and civil liberty : It is high time to detach
1 yourfelvei from them, and rally round the
3 friends of Virtue, Order, and Federalism.
1 FRENCH CRUELTf.
HOM THE HISTORY OF THE FIVE INDIAN
NATMNS OF CANADA.
> " The Count dc Frontenac waspierced to
, the heart, when he found that he could not
â¢ revenge these terrible inenrfions of the Five
â¢ Nations ; and his anguifhmade him guil.y of
â¢ such a piece of rtlonftrous cruelty, in burn
l ing a prisoner alive after the Indian manner,
f as though I have frequently mentioned to
have been done by the Indians, yet I fore
-1 bore giviug the particulars of such barbarous
1 afts, fufpedting it might be too offenfive to
â¢ Christian ears, even in the history of fava
Â» geÂ». Here however I think it ufeful to give
: a cfrcumftantial account of this horrid ait,
1 to, shew on one hand, what courage and re
-1 folution,-virtue, the love of glory, and the
1 . love of one's country can instil into men*6
! minds, even where the knowledge of true
1 religion is wanting ; and on the other hand,
' how far a falfe policy, under a corrupt religi
r on, can debase even great minds.
The Count dc Frontenac, condemned two
â¢! prifouers of the Five Nations to be burnt
â  publicly alive. The Ihtendant's lady in
i treated him to moderate the fentcnce, and
: the Jesuits, it is said, used their endeavours
I for the fame purpose. But the Count de
Frontenac said, there is a necessity of ma
king such an example to frighteÂ® the Five
' Nations from approaching the plantations,
I fihoe the indulgence, that had hitherto been
1 i shewn, had encouraged them to advauce
1 with the greatest bofdnefs to the very gates
los their towns ; while, they thought they
' f run ao other risque, but of being made pri
' foners, whire they live better than at home.
He added, that the Five Nations having
burnt so many French, juftified this me
thod of malyng reprisals. But with sub
mission to the politeoefs of the French nati
on, may I not ask, whether every (or any)
horrid-aftion of a barbarous enemy, can juf
tify a civilized nation in doiag the like ?
When the governor could not be mo
ved, the Jesuits went to the prison, to in
ftruftthe prisoners in the mysteries of our ho
ly religion, viz. of the Trinity, the Incar
nation of our Saviour, the joys of paradise,
and the punishments of Hell, to fit their
fouls for Heaven by baptism, while their
bodies were condemned to torment'. But
the Indians, after they had heard their sen
tence, refufed to hear the jesuits speak, and
began to prepare for death in their own
country manner, by fingiug their death
song.
Some charitable person threw a knife in
to the prison, with which one of them dis
patched himfelf: The other was carried out
to ihe place of execution by the christian
Indians of Loretto, to which he walked,
seemingly, with as much indifference as ever
Martyr did to the flake. While they were
torturing him, he continued singing, that
he was a warrior brave and without fear ;
that the most cruel death could not shake
his courage ; that the most cruel torment
fhau'd not draw an indecent exprefuon from
him j that hie comrade was a coward, a
scandal to the five nations, who had killed
himfelf for fear of pain ; that he had the
comfort to reflefl, that he had made many
Frenchmen fuffer as he did now. He fully
verified his words, for the most violent tQr
rrient could not force the least complaint
from him, though his executioners tried
their utmost skill to do it. They firft
.broiled his feet bttwesn two red hot stones;
r <
then /they put li is fingers into red hot pipes,
and though hfe had his arms at liberty, he
would uot pull his firjgers out ; they cut
his joints, and taking hold of the sinews,
twilled them round fraall bars of iron. All
this while he kept singing and recounting his
own brave a&ions again!! the French. At
last they flead his scalp from his (kull, and
poured scalding hot sand upon it ; at which
time the intendant's lady obtained leave of
the governor to have the coup-de-grace giv
en, and I believe she thereby likewise ob
tained a favour to every reader, in delivering
him from a further continuance of this ac
count of French cruelty."
MORAL.
Thoughts on Miff, confident! as a Microcofmos,
or Little IVorld.
Man has been considered, and with good
reason, as an abftraft or model in miniature
of the universe. God made him the last and
mod excellent of his creatures. He inter
nally endowed him after his own image,
with a divine understanding, whereby he
might contemplate and serve his Creator ;
and he furnifhed him with the powers and
faculties of reason that he might govern the
world and all the creatures fubjeCi to his
command. God also having created
three forts of living natures, viz. angelical,
rational and brutal, gave to angels an in
tellectual and to hearts a sensitive nature ;
but to man he vouchfafed both, together
with the rational abilities peculiarly be
longing to him ; and hence he became the
bond or chain of union of all the three, and
by his participation of them may be truly
said to be a little world, as presenting so ex
actly its component parts.
God therefore placed on the earth, the
man he had made, as it were another world ;
the great in the small: For out of the earth
and dust was formed the frefh of man, and
therefore strong and durable. His blood,
which is dispersed by branches' of veins and
arteries throughout the body, may be re
sembled to those waters which are called
brooks and rivers over all the earth ; his
breath to the air ; his natural heat to the
warmth which the earth Contains in itfelf,
and which, stirred up by the heat of the
fun, afliits naiui e ~nr iTuT fpeed:Vv procrM
tion of those rarities which the earth b'ring
â¢ eth forth ; hi* radical mnifture, oil or bal
: sam, on which thr natural heat feeds and is
I maintained, tothefatandfertililyoftheearth ;
j the hairs of his body which adorn or over
i shadow it, to graft which covers the upper
j face and (kin of the earth ; his generative
t power, to nature which produces Ml things ;
his determination?, to light, wandering and
unliable clouds, wafted away by uncertain
winds ; his eyes, to the light of the fun and
moon ; the beauty of his youthful days, to
the flowers of the spring, which either the
fierce puffs of wind blow from their stalks,
or in a short time the fun's piercing rays dry
up and wither ; the thoughts of his mind,
to the rapid and inftananeous motion of ce
lestial fpiriti ; his pure nnderllanding to
those intelledtual natures which are always
present with God ; and his immortal foul,
while righteous and exalted by the beauty of
holiness, to the image and fimiltudc of God
himfelf, for, though in respect to God, no
man is just, or good or righteous, yet, with
such a kind of difference's subsists between
the substance and shadow, goodness may be
found in man, and God being pleased to ac
cept it, has therefore called him the image
and similitude of his own righteousness.
The allusion may be drawn out to a still
greater length, and man as the measure of all
things, may again resemble by his fevtn a
ges, the seven planets. Our infancy may
be compared to the moon, in which we
seem only to live and grow as plants ; the
second to Mercury, wherein we arc taught
and inftrudted ; our third age to Venus, the
days of love, desire, and vanity; the fourth
to the fun, the-ftrong, flourifhing and beau
tiful agÂ»of man's life ; the fifth to Mars, m
which we begin to take ah account of our
time, judge ourselves and grow to the per
fection of our understanding ; last, and se
venth, to Saturn, when our days are fad and
overcast. In these we find by dear and la
mentable experience, and by losses never to
be repaired, that of all our vain passions and
affections, sorrow only abideth. Our atten
dants are sicknesses, and sundry infirmities,
and by how much the more we are accompa
nied with plenty, by so much the more
greedily is our end desired. When time
has made us unfociabfe to others, we be
come a burden to ourfeWs, and are of no
other use than to withhold the riches we
possess from our successors. In this time it
is, that we, for the most part, and seldom
before, prepare for our eternal habitation
whith we pass on to with many fighs,groans,
and doleful thoughts* and in the end, by
the workmanship of death, finifh the forrow
fuT business of a wretched life, towards which
we are always making advances both in
sleeping and waking ; never have those be
loved companions of honor and riches any
power to hold one day, by flattering the
promise of entertainments ; but by what
crooked path foevtr we walk, the fame leads
on direftly to the house of death, whose
doers lie open at all hours, and to all per
sons. For this tide of man's life, after once
turning and declining, ever runs with a per
petual ebb and falling flream, but never flows
againâour leaf once fallen springs no more.
Neither does the fun or the fumm'er adorn
us again with the garments of new Leaves or
flowers. Foryf there is any baiting place, or
reft, in the course or race of man's life, the
fame might then be perpetually maintainal

life ofplants is preferred, does evermore as
cend or descend ; so it is with the life of
man, which is always either ipcreafing to
wards ripeness and perfection, or declining
towards rotteanefs and dissolution.

It appears by a New Prbvi'dence paper,
handed us lad evening by capt. Johnson,
that thÂ« privateer Revenue,, tvbich captured
the (hip Asia, is owned by citizen Jean
Baron, residing in Philadelphia, as appear!
by a copy of the privateer's eortimiflW
found on board of the prize {hip.
The above paper is dated at Nassau, '
Aug. 11,
BOSTON, September 6.
fICKAROONERY.
Captain A 'jams arrived at Gloucester,
from Martinique,' l'rt lat. 40, long. 67, was
boarded from the piratical French privateer
which lately failed from Marblehcad, and
robbed of his light fails, a barrel of beef,
and some fmaii articles. The officer told,
captain Adams he should make a prize of
him, were it not that expeaing to fall in
with some Indiamen, he did not wi/h to be
detained.
CADIZ BOMBARDMENT.
By arrivals from Lisbon, we learn, that
admiral St. Vincents, after having obliged
the Spanish fleet to take fhelter'in Cadiz
harbour, had inveftcd that city. In the
prosecution of his plan, he captured port
St. Mary's, a place* about fix miles from
Cadiz, and from whence the city is supplied
with water, vegetables. &c. ftje Spanish
fleet having retired beyond the part of the
island on which Cadiz'is situated, St. Vin
cents proceeded to bombard both the city
and the fleet beyond it. By the last ac
counts from- Lisbon, the bombardment must
have commenced about the 4th or sth of
July, and had not ceased on the 9th or 10th,
as will be seen by Mefirs letters.
Lord St. Vincents' ffeet has been strongly
reinforced since his engagement with the
Spanish : And the troops which lately eva
cuated thÂ£ island of Elba, in the Mediter
ranean (4000) are said to have joined him.
It is said. Â» gifÂ«t Â»art of the inhabitants
-have rr-TI, 3l~tfieTjparufhfleet~27rccwered no
disposition to meet the' English ; which
from its length of time at sea, and experi
ence of commander*, was in.a high state of
discipline. The damages done to the town,
and .fleet, are variously related ; but the fa&
of the bombardment may be relied on.
The pofleflion of port St. Mary's was ne
ceflary to the supply of the English fleet
with water.
Letters from Lisbon suggest it as the
opinion of many, that admiral Jerri# means
to destroy as much of the Spanish fleet as
possible ; and then lay Cadiz under' a heavy
contribution a la mode Francaije.
In such contempt does admiral Jervis hold
the Spanish fleet, thÂ»t while lying ofTCadiz
harbour, he by turns unrigged and rigged
the veftels of his fleet, n open view ; and
it one time, we are informed by an Ameri
can captain who saw it, five ships had aau
ally their t&pmafh on deck at the fame timt?*.
and fevcral ship's of the squadron (ailed into
the harbour, gave the forts a broadside, and
returned. C. : i
Capiain Alien, arrived at Gloucester from
Lisbon, 50 days, confirms the of
the bombardment.
LATE FROM FRANCE.
' [Through the friendly attention of Mr.
John G. Rogers, of Gloueeftcr, we were
Lift evening favored with Paris papers to
T u 'y 16th, received there by captain Inger
fol, from Bordeaux.]
Afteracurfory perusal of them, we can
only fay, that the Courier Ju Corps Legifla
tify of July 16, informs:âThe negociationa
for peace are seriously entered upon at Lille.
Every day the two legations meet 3t 11 in
the morning :âTheir conferences are never
long. The English conduft with prudence ;
and are much esteemed in Lisle. The mi
niflers of the French legation are also held
in high refpeft. Fifty cannon were fired cm
the arrival us lord Malmefbury, at Lisle.
" Letters from Italy state, that general
Meerfeldt has again arrived at Montebello ;
svhere he had a long conference with general
Buonaparte ; which terminated to the fatis
ifaftion of the two parties. Buonaparte im
mediately difpatehed a courier extraordinary
to Paris. Ti"Â» fame letters kate, that the Ift
July was fixed on for the |>urpofe of pro
claiming at Milan, the definitive treaty of
peace ; and the independence of the Italian
republics."
In the fame paper of the 15 th, in a de
bate upon the celebration of the 14th Ju
ly, Vaublanc congatulated the Council, that
the mediation of Buonaparte, fupportcd bv
the pacific disposition Si the Directory, had
succeeded in the liberation of La Fayette,
Latour Mauburg, and Bureau de Puzy,who
are reflored to liberty and independence.
The negotiations at Lisle are to be car
ried on solely with the English Commiffion^r.
The " Pojlillor. d;s Armeei" of the 14th
July, fays, that Perignon is recalled from
the embafiy to Spain ; to which place Per
rochel has been sent.
" It appears positive that the emperor
has difpatehed orders for the liberation of
the prisoners at Olmutz." This paper of
the 6th July contains" Prefidtnt Adam:,'

It is a strong proof of the salubrity of the

Tfce.town is now thronged with ftranger3 of

f Mr. BENJAMIN WTNKOOP.
Sir,
Agreeably to promise, I fliall now 1 nply
: as concisely aa pofiible to such parts of your
letter as occur to my recolleftion.
The reason why I did not mention the
ctrcumftances which gave rife to the yellow
fever in 1793, was not, as you insinuate,
because those did not suit my
system, or because the dites were so recent
that I was afraid of having the fubjedl in
vestigated ; but, brciufe the colltge of
physicians had publiihe<l their opinion that
. the disease took its origin from contagion,
j and that they believed the contagion had
! been imported by a vefTel from t?ie Weft
â  Indies. Let those desirous of feeing* the
reasons afligned â¢by the college for their
opinion, call on Dr. James, the secretary
of the college, and fatisfy themselves ; or
read my ( review of Dr. Rufli's book on
the subject, published in 1794.
You ask how certain pcrfonJ-to the nortti,
came to be affe&ed with fever, before those
to the south of the Arsthufa, (which I
have charged wijh giving rife to the dife.ife)
when the wind mud have carried the efflu
via, if any arose from that veflel, in an op
posite direftion to them. This circum
stance is easily explained.âContagious dis
eases do not require wind to waft them
from one person to anotherâall they re
quire is the near approach of the found to
the bodies of the sick, or to any porous
substance that hag lately been near the body
of the sick in a confined situation. While
the brig Iris from Oporto was unloading,
the crew of the Arethufa had to pass across
that veflel to get on (hore with their chests,
bedding, &c. ar.d it is natural to suppose,
as some of the bungs flew out of the wine
calks and the mariners were miking merrr,
that some of the crew of the Arethufa alio
partook of their cheer with them. Mr.
Latimer, Mr. Lewis, and others, might
have received the contagion from palling
near thole people with their infefted mate
rials ; those who workccK in fail-lofts from
her fail* and those of the Hind ; and this is
the way that contagious fevers are generally
propagated, and this, I am sure, is one of
the ways that the disease now continues-to
be propagated. Contagion is an invisible
substance, known only from its effefts.
The effluvia of mar(Ke3, of putrid vegeta
bles, or of bilge water, which contains no
thing different from ftagtiant marfli water,
namely, vegetable and animal substances in
a state of putrefadlion, when they have
any effeft at ally only produce an intermit
ting or remitting fever, according as the
fubjeft to whom thejr are applied is morfc.
or less vigorous ; and diseases pro
duced are never propagated by contagion.
Please to permit me to tranferibe the o
pinion delivered gn this fubjeft, by one of
the best informed and molt judicious physi
cians of the present or any former age, the
celebrated Cullen of Edinburgh, in his firft
lines, vol. i
" As fevers are so generally epidemic, it
is probable that some matter floating in the
atmosphere, and applied to the bodies of
men, ought to be considered as the remote
cause of Fevers : and theCr matters present
in the atmosphere, and thus afting upon
men may be considered, either as contagions
âthat is effluvia, arising direftly or origin
ally frotnthebody of a man under a parti
cular disease and exciting the fame kind of
disease in the body of the person to whom
they are applied ; or Miasmata that is efflu
via, arising from the stagnant water of marsh
es (which contain more or less dead and
putrefying vegetable matters) producing a
disease in the person to whom they are ap
plied."
" It appears likely that the contagions
which produce fevers are not of great vari
ety ; perhaps there is but onecommon
of such contagions."- s
" For it is well known that the effluvia
ftantly ifluing from the living human body,
if long retained in the fame place, without
being diffufed in the atmosphere, acquire a
Angular virulence ; and in that state being
applied to the bodies of men, become the
cause of a fever which is highly contagious."
" The existence of such a caul? is fully
proved by the late observations on jail, hos
pital, (and ship fevers)."
That these contageous effluvia are render
ed more or less virulent as the dircumftance
of climate' and season happen to concur with
the other circnmftances which give origin
to the contagion has been l*telyconfirmed by
the obfervationsof Do&or Chilholm of Gre
nada an a (hip fever which was introduced
into that ifknd in the vernal season of 1793,
and destroyed one fifth of all the inhabitants
and nearly one half ot all the ijiariners at
that time in purt.
I have foftietbing rrore to [add on this
fubjedt, but ahi obliged to defer it to a fu
ture opportunity. In tl.e mean time ac
cept Â«f the firiÂ«re!t wishes for your welfare.
From your humble fervnnt,

MR. *iV\'o,
/ An artful, mfidious paper, signed A

You will oblige me by telling the pale-faeed

BALTIMORE, September 7.
This morning, precisely at 9 o'clock, at
the navy yard of Major Stodder, the build
er, was launched, the United States frigate
Constellation. The novelty of the
scene, she being the firft frigate ever built at
this port, drew forth an immense concoui%
of citizens, of both sexes, and of all ages,,
and notwithstanding the carlinefs of the
hour appointed for the launch, the number,
we are warranted in faying, was never e
qualled on any oecafion in this city. The
furface of the Patapfco was covered with in
numerable boats, and the adjacent hills, east
of Harris's creek, swarmed with infpeÂ£tors;
and so admirable, too, were the situations
around, that every one had the pleasure of
gratifying his euriofity, without risking the
least accident.
A number of volunteers, in uniform, were
admitted on board, while others were set to
guard the yard and permit no one to enter,
; unlÂ«fs engaged in the business of the day.â
The workmen, amounting to 200, being
thus kept iinobftiA ted, carried on their
work with such regularity and dispatch, ss
reflected the greatest credit both on themr
selves and their able conduitor. Every or
der was commiiflicated by a taffle from the
drum, and the operations of the men in
wedging ug the veflel, &c. were apparently
performed with as much and preci
sion, as the manual etfercife by a regiment
of veterans. The anxious moment noiv ar
rivedâand now description is beggared.
Every thing being In the molt complete
preparations, all the bloeks taken away, e
very man from under the veflel, and the hull
standing upon almost nothing but the'flip
perry tallow, orders were given for knocking
atfay the last ftaunchion: this being done, j
file moved gracefully and majestically down I
her ways, amidst the silent amazement of 1
thousands of fpeftators, to her destined ele- â 
merit, into which she plunged with such ease
and fafety, as to make the hills resound with j
reiterated bursts of joyful acclamations.
Her plunge into the water was attended 1
with so little velocity, that she came to an
chor within ICIO yards of the shore,'' and we
can pronounce, from the authority of able
and experienced judges, that no vessel was
ever taken from the Itocks in a more fafe and â¢
judicious manner than the Constellation, and I
that no man, on a similar oceafion, ever ac
quitted himfelf with more honour and abili
ty than did Major Benjamin Stodder.
