I TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public
wafning all persons against purchasing from the
jranteesof Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
n large, real and ptrfonal ellates h(e conveyed' away to
n his fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upon the fub}eÂ£t by a general and
- numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moote as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confided in the fubferibers by
those creditors: a step which it woold have been a
m bieach of duty' and honor in them to have omitted,
id The very ftatcment of the faÂ£l therefore mull dif
*â¢ pel the imputation that it was. either " precipitate
or vindifliVe." It originated in a desire to frcure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fan&ioned by the
j' advice of council as' a rtreafure necejfary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advertisement has been
le injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
50 to his own unjuftitiable conduiS, not to the iub-
fcribers who have merely publilhed the truth in
i g terms as mild as the fadt vfoilld admit, and who
a ' mean to investigate in a high court of justice the
validity of thile purchafeSj of whicb Mr. M'Cle
naehan so confidently speaks.
d Tfee fubferibers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
]' caution. againtl purohafing of those grantees or
jf either of them, and to extend tbe terms of it to a
at purehafe from any other persons (if such there br)
10 to whom Mr. M'Clenachan fnay have made similar'
at
conveyances.

meafurcs were necelfary tq be taken with refpeft
to the balances found by the commiflioners appoin

" ftefolved by the senate and house df rfprefgn.
tatives, that the President of the United States be

which may be made in any of the fix per cents,
three per cents, or deferred stock of the United

Mr. Freeman presented the petition of Philip

l red to the committee of claims.
Mr. W. Smith fai'tl he wilhed to lay * refolntion
â¢ on the table. It was well known that the city of
Savannah, in Georgia, had fuffeted in the most
alarming manner, by that greatell of all calamities,
â  fire ; fa that.four-fihhs of the whale tow# was re
duced to alhesr He was desirous that some relief
(hould be afforded to the unhappy fufferert from
the treasury of the United States. He believed
there was no precedent wherein similar relief had
been granted. They had indeed afforded relief to
fufferert from the Weft-Indies. He did not mean
that a large sum (hould be granted ; but he thto't
fi|ch a sum might be given, as, in conjun&ion with
the support which they might receive from other
quarters, might relieve the distress which must be
the confluence of such a calamity. This refolu
tion was in the following words:
" Resolved, That the fun of ought to be
granted towards the relief of the fuffereis by the
late fire at Savannah in Georgia."
It was read a second time, and ordered to be
committed to a committee of the whole to morrbw.
Mr. W. Smith moved that the bill for the more
effeflnal collection of certain internal revenues of
, the United States be committed to a committee of
the whole house. It was made the order for Mon
day.
Mr. Harper moved the order of the day on the
report of the committee to whom was referred the
memorial of the commilfionerÂ»-of the Federal City,
and so much of the President's speech as related to
a national university. The house accordingly form
ed itfelf into a committee of the whole on that fu
jedt, Mr. Coit in the chair, when the report having
. been read,
Mr. Macon wiflied to know what were the ap
' propriations which had been made towards this ob
jefl ?
Mr. Craik said rh?t the President had given be
. tween nineteen and twenty acrft of iand, -for the
pnrpofe of creating an university.
Mr N:cl:sLs fnpj that tltit iliftrifl of cfltiti
try would one day or other, (land in need of a fe
ininary of learning ; but it appeared to him, that
Miey were about to go into a bufwef? which might
carry them farther than ,they apprehended. He
did titjt think the period was arrived for the infti
tution of a national tiniverOty. He had no idea
, of erecting such an university at this place, which
. could only be done by taking money from distant
p difttiftsof country, which would receive no bene
fit from the institution, as he believed the nearer
home youth could be inftrufted, so as to be in fume
degree under the eye of their parents, the better
p it was for them, both as it refpedted their learning
and morals.âlf a national university were to be
( established, funds fhouid be found to support it.â
_ It was true, the President had recommended this
institution ; but this was no proof that he thought
it was a fubjeit to be immediately set about. It
was the last time he would have an opportunity qf
addreSing them, and perhaps he supposed it might,
be considered at some future period. It would be
many years, he said, before that diftrift would
have ocpafion for an university, and he. was of opi
! nion that gentlemen fiom other partsof the union
, would not fay that they wiftied the inftitrttion. In
deed one thing appeared evident to him, that if
the house entered into the business at all, they
! (hould be looked up to for funds to go through with
, the business.
Mr. Harper said, he thought the gentleman last
l up had not attended to the report. There was no-t
thing in that which went to the pledging of the
Uuited States to find funds, nor was it the objeÂ£t
of the report to eftablidi a national university. He
agreed with that gentleman that we were not ar
rived at the period for such an institution. But if
attention were paid to the memorial on whieh the
report was founded, it would appear that the ob}eÂ£t
! of the commiflioners was not the eftahliftimeut of
ail univeifity, nor of funds, but merely an author
ity to enable them to hold such property as had
beeD and might be appropriated for the purpose.
The President had already given about nineteen
acres of land, and had figuified his intention of
giving 50 (hares in the Potowmac canal. The re
port went no farther than to authorize persons to
hold this and any other property which might be
given to the institution in tmft. He hoped it
would be agreed to.
Mr. Baldwin said, he had not. attended much to
the fubjedt, but he saw no objection to agreeing to
the report. The firft qusftion to be determined
was, Was such an institution defitable ? It there,
be afketf, any other place of education near this
diftriit to which this seminary might be hostile ?
He bjjieved not, bat rather that thediftance of this
place from any other cllaLli(hment of the kind made
it a proper lituation for such an inftiturion. If
desirable, could any one, he added, take such a step
but themselves I It must be allowed they could not.
He therefore thought, if the step jwas proper,
though it might be fifty or a hundred years hence
before such an institution ftiould be'wanted, there
could be no harm in taking it now. It might be
(aid that it was improper for them to make a cor
poration of thit business, but he said this would
not be the firft instance of forming a corporation*
and as no pecuniary iid was contemplated, hetruft
ed there could be no solid objection to the measure.
He (hould therefore vote for the report.
Mr. Craik /hould he sorry, after thi eaition the
committee had obfifrved in forming their report, in
order to obviate all objeiflions, that thÂ»fubje<9.fhÂ«uldbe
clogged with those which it did not merit. If the report
had contemplated the raising of a fund for the support
of the University in question, gentlemen woi|ld hive
had some ground for their opposition ; but, as this
had not been contemplated, he did not expefl to have
heard the report objeited to. In particular he did not
expert to hear it affci ted from the quarter whence it
came, that such institution: were not neceflary in that
country; such an aflertion might have come with
greater propriety from any other part of the Union
than from the southern part of it.âlf the fubjefl was
before them, Mr. Craik said, he fliould find no diffi
culty in (hewing that the Legifisrure of the Union
ought to paternize such an inftitutiqn ; but, as fhif
was not the cafe, but they were merely alked to au
thorize persons to receive what might be given to the
Institution, he hoped that house would not (hut, the
door againlt such donatious. The f.tuation of the ci
ty of Wafliington, would induce many, he said, to
to this institution. It would uot interfere
with ai.y other. Its central lituation rendered it a pro
per situation for filth an University, and all that was
â  wanting from them was the power to receive such do
nations as might be given to it.
Mr. VV. Lyman said he understood that part of the
land appropriated for the publie use of the United
States, was to be appropriatrd to this University.
Did not this (hew, he said, that the United States
meant to patroniz# the institution ? If they were to
take this (lep, he (hould be much surprised if they
were not soon called upon for money. He did not tx
pe& the liberality of individuals would do much.
Was it expeifted, he acted, that the people of the
United States (hould fend their children from all parts
to this institution ? He believed there never wouid be
an institution of this fort that would draw youth from
remote parts of the Union ; End, therefore, those who
contribute towards it at a distance, would receive no
it. He thought they were going too far
in this business. If it wi> the authority to receive do
nations only which was wanted, the state of Mary
land couU grant that , but he did not believe the peo
ple of the United States would wish to negledt all the
schools in the Union, to encourage the National Uni
versity. He believed he had as liberal notions with
refpetl to education as other gentlemen ; buthctho't
fmallltademies more ufeful than large national efhb
- lilhmef ts \tfhich were not within the reach of the peo-,
. pie at largeâa few only could partake of the benefits
o such an eliablifhment; and he believed, if thev
looked only amongst our own countrymen, it would
be found that these academies had produced many emi
nent charaifters. He supposed it would -be neceflary
to have some place of education within that diftrifl ;
butbe hoped no plan would ever be adopted, which
(hould draw from remote parts of the Union,
which could not derive any benefit from tie itlftitu
tion.
Mr. Dayton ( the Speaker) said, if it should ever
be the polity of the United States to establish a Na
tional University, he was of opinion this was an impro
per time for making the decision. He did not be
lieve the committee who made tha report meant to
do more that had been ftatedj but the elfedt he said,
would be, what had been predicted ; this measure
would be looked upon as an entering wedge, and the;
(houldhereafter be tpld they must iÂ»o through with it.
If gentlemen were prepared to fandtion an iuftttutioii
of (ills kim?, ther would of :ou.-'e doit: he -wis nnj
prepared to vote tor ihe ineai'urc, but ihuuld give i t

NEW-YORK, December 2j.
1. â  A
It is a ciicurtiflance we mention with extreme
regret, that there is ground to believe the bold and
audacious villainy now prafiifed in this and other
cities, has been encouraged by the relaxation di
criminal law. It is nbferved by the judges,, that
culprits formerly tried for their lives, never appear
ed at the bar to receive sentence without trembling,
and every nerve agi ated. The cafe is now altered.
Criminals whose punishment is imprison
ment,- when called to the bar to hear their sentence,
approach with levity and even gaiety. This was
so obvious at the late court, that it was hardly pos
sible far a judge to assume a felemn countenance
when he pronounced sentence. This is a iWbjeft
of a feriou3 nature } and tho we arc decided friends
of lenity, it appears doubtful whether in the pre
sent Bate of society, the abolition of death for
certain crimes, will not produce alarming conse
quences.
At the close of every war, the prices of proper
ty, of all kinds, never fail to fall. This cirtum.
(tance alone would always produce much embartafv
ment to men in commerce, manufa&urrs and sgii
rulturc. But the fpeculatioi sin land, in the Urn",
ted States, are among the umft fruitful foiiices of
embarrassment. They have given rife to a fyftern
of credit, which involves inextricable diffi ulties
and misfortunes. The multitude of basks in this
country, destined originally to aid thr merchant;
solely, have contributed much to augment the pre
sent calamities of bufinefs-they have been'too
raudi used to support speculating projefls, by eras
ting enormous credits.
Tothefe foufces Â»f emharrafiment, mÂ«ft be adi
ded the enormous defalcations from tlie capital of
our merchants, by the seizure and detention of
their property, by thÂ» English and French. An
exact eaimateof the amount of American pioper.
ty thus fetzed, or detained unpaid for, cannot be
known, but the fallowing will be fotmd not hi girt,,

It is probable that this amount of twelve millions
and a half of American capital is now in the hands
of the British and French. The seizures under
the orders of Nov. 6,. have been declared by the
British admiralty mostly illegal, and reflitution
twarded. Bat the money is not paid. The French
government have also promised to fulfil their con
tract, but imperious necejfity has yet picvnted.
Such defalcations from the capital of our mer
chants mult fererely affect the course of business.
On Sunday morning lall at about 4 o'clock, one
of the patroles of the second ward discovered in
Mr. Patten s Cooper (hop in Depeyfter street, a

in the fire place, and would, in all probability, '
have set the shop on fire, had not the patrole extin
guished it. Ihe window of the shop was open.
The patroles of the fame ward fonnd two men
and a woman fitting by a very large fire in the coo

which the fire was kept up. The mailers of such

cerns their interefls, it is " an outrageous attempt
upon the dignity of an independent nation "
It is wonderful, that the Aurora should desert
its paymaftersin the hour of their difttefs, and have
honesty enough to publish, for once, the truth.
The democrats in. the Aurora, affect to make a
doubt, whether a President 6f the United States

This iÂ» very severe on our democrats in Congrcfs,

sneak They would not go to war in any event.
The faderal men faidânegociate, prepare for war,

From the Aurora.
" A late Secretary wiilied, that the citizens of
the western counties would burn PittfburgrhâAnd
probably Jaime of his partisans are fulfilling the
wish of this incendiiry in different parrs of the con
tinent. He wished Pittsburgh burned to give go
vernment a pretext for glutting its vengeance ; and
hit partisans may think, that setting fire to the dif
ferent cities on the continent, may give them an
opportunity of implicating the democratic repub
licans, and give them a coup de grace."
The above, fays a correspondent, can allude on
ly to the Secretary of the Precious Coofeffions.
When the people of the United States discover
tha f t the warmest terms of friendfhip have been made
[ use of by any nation to cover designs hoflile to
their interefls and their independence, however lull
ed by foft founds for a time, however pleasing na
tional friendfhip may have'appjared to their philan
thropic andgenerous hearts, they will be aroused to
an .indignation and a contempt of their insidious de
ceivers, proportioned to the value thry had set up
on sincere promises. When they (hall know, as
soon they will, that it has heeri the horrible design
of the French, to gain the direction of our Ex
ecutive ; and to do this, that they lay it down as |
a fettled plan of afiion./o projlrate the character of
IVafhington, and to produce a total change in the
jÂ»rm of the Executive in,to a DinSsry of Five, the |
good sense of the people will perceive the extreme i
danget of putting themselves, as in many parts of <
the union the Jacobins have done, under the '
ance of any foreign influence whatever. They will
then fee how effeiitial it is to know less of fereign
agents, and to adhere to a government of their own
adoptionâ to men of their own choice. It will
soon be fonnjl, that the maxim, that tut ought nei- 1
ther to love nor to hate any foreign nation, is a found
one. Had the people of the union displayed in fa
your of the BHtifh the fame enthiifialtic, blind and
ignorant love which they Lave toward# the French,
we should have seen similar efforts made bv the Bri
tish to involve us in a cornmoa war against France,
and similar appeals to the people to set them against
iheir government. The British court would have
confideted, this overflowing Love of the people was
an invitation to them to interfere in our affairs ; j
and as (killftil politicians, they would not have been
juftifiable to their own nation, if ihey had not foiz
ed a fit oat ion of things so favourable to the promo
tion of their own inrerelts and views against France.
The wild attachment of the people to the French
catife, and to the French nation, proceeded from
sympathy at firft, and was augmented by a rooted
avetfion to Great-Britain. This temper the French
nave had art enough to turn to their advantage ;
and flattered into a belief, that the fame people who
had affections for a foreign nation, could have no
fettled principles, and lio national character of their
own, they have a ventured, in the moll open/nan
net, to make an appeal fromÂ»the government to the
people, with a fixed deteimination to threaten us
into one of two thingsâa civil war between those '
traitors who would support them, against those

are turned; who, it is believed, may yqt be able to '
conciliate the fitmnefs and dignity of his indipeu '
dent country, with the reftoraiion of harmony with '
our ambitious filter republic. His endeavouts
mud however depend for fticcefs on the firm coun !
tenance of om freemen. Tha evil has sprung from 1
a national disease ; the nation malt aid the removal '
of that evil, by discarding from their bosoms those
exotic poisons, that have unhappily invited the en
croachments of the French government.
The Aurora talks of removing the statues and
paintings from Italy, in order to take the dufl off them.
This may be well enoughâBut it reminds one of
a char after in Hamlet, who, wishing to get out of
the air, was afksd, whither he would fly from it f- '
Into the grave, replied he. '
<
Mr. Bache thinks, the piiftures and statues plun
dered from Italy, will be brought fafely. Their '
hze, their delicacy, the badness of the roads over ! 1
the Alps, forbid the hope that the eminent artifls 1
(French grenadiers) will get them fafely to Paris. J
t here, fays Mr. Bachc, they will do more good
thaniin the cloilters of monks. There, it maybe '
allowed, they will eternise the barlarifn of the
trench. What fine keepers of books, pictures, '
and statues the French artists (armed with pikes) ;
will prove in future, may be conjeaured from the 1
pad.
" For five years, whatever was precious in paint

Captain Jeffup was cruelly whipped by captain
Pigot, and a young American gentleman was im

'"the Aurora, with evident fatisfatlion, as a<ty dis
cerning reader will plainly discover. The repetition
of them evinces a desire of the party to palliate the
â  outrage offered to the country, by the
ing minister ; and, fccondly, to criminate our go
vernment, aj if it had to answer for the injury to,
captain Jeflup, and the perfwn who was (hot at.
Fadls, that tend to either of these points, are mat
ters of joy and exultation to the party: and if all
our captains (were whipped, and their mÂ«n all im
prefled, the party would tejoire, because they.would
expe& to gais (Irength by every new cause of irri
tation. Like their paymasters, they would acenfe
our government of having allowed the Britifhtodo
It. Not one instance has yet occurred of the admini
(l rat ion having neglefled the interest of the citiiens.
It is no thaniis to the party in Congress or out that
our pnfoners are not now in Algiersâ that our ships
are not all captured and without compenfarion. In
every tranfaaion the vigilance and faithfulnefs of
government have left the Jacobins no right to find
fault. And in no instance have they a right to
boast of their own-spirit to affcrt American dignity
aid hoaor.
When they marched under a French flag to '
vott, when they formed mobs to protest privateer
ing, when they aided Genet in their clubs, riototis
afTembiirs, See. to levy war within our territory and i
to |nfell our goeernment. Surely in neither of
those instances have they cause to boast.
Some years ago, a sea-captain was whipped by
a Frenchman They were calm enough then. Our
veffals were (lopped in France, ftired on the high
seas, and many millions of property are taken from
us, without profpeft of compensation. The Jaco
bins bear this wonderful wellâbetter, it seems,
than to have our veflVls carried into England, and
PAID FQR. To insult our government, to med
dle in our elections, to rob our merchants, to break
Memn treaties, to tamper with the weltern settlers
all this, and more, our Jacobins bear: arÂ»d what
is (Iranger than all, theyâyes! by all that's im
pudent ! -- they talk of aliening our itational ho
nour ! dignity ! and independence !
The Bo don Chronicle remarks on the
thanksgiving, " Thit we ought to humble ourselves for
our rebellious iifpofition"- which that truly independ

and the French Republic. Modern patriotism and the
