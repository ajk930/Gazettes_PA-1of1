in dividing the money among the creditors. I m-gtd Mr.

MK. Fekno,
IN yottr paper of jrefltrrfajr I read this fentcree
in a piece signed a Ftdcraliji :
" Here we might offer exculpatory remarks eon
" cerninjf the d'tspofitions, which a concurrence t>f
[ S . " circumjlatuei like these might nattirallv excite in the
' " bosom of Secretary Jcjferfan ; perhaps we might
" fully eflablifh his mfhit on the Â»ccafion."
Tllo' this very ft tidied fentencc k ait Fully couch
lg' a ' ed in the Ftmbiguous, cautions, and appYopriati lan.
vill, ytiajre of the writer, enough is said to discover a
orfe timid willingness to becomc the apokgift of Mr.
Jefferfon, and to vindicate hisconjudl, in reference
to Genet's intrigues. That this is the drfign of
the writer is explained by his introdueiirtr the l'ro
'1" clamation nf the king'of England against France,
|K i s and the order yf 6IJÂ» November, agaihft our tom
mercc, inimedittely previous li> his remark, which
he begins with " Here we mi;;ht octet," &c. rsft
injftli t cxctilpstion o( Mr. jefferfon on those fafls.
Why does not this writer come boldly out and vin
infj dicate hie favorite ? The public would be inftrtift- I
ed by his exculpatory remarks, and delighted at 1
the fame time with the ingenuity of a writer ca- 1
nth pabie of juttifying the condudt of Mr. Jefferfon in '
July, 1792, by a proclamation and an order, not J
' iffned 'till the OP.oler and November followingâLet
him be plain and explicit, and if he can prove to <
sat the public fatisfaftion that any aft of a foreign gov- '
J ernment, however hostile towards us, can juftify <
our Secretary of State in furremdering to a foreign !
, agent our felf government and independence, then '
an- it will be acknowledged, to borrow the exprcfiions
of the writer, that the opponents of Mr. Jeffer- 1
" son have unconsciously fleepefl their pens in the r
" acidulated gill of felt-deceiving prejudice." F
This writer affects to speak well of Mr. Pinclnry,
See. who is underfiood, he tells us, to be set up by the F
friends of Mr. /tdams ; and that no objeflions have /
been made to him by the aiitifederal and jacobin par-
ty ; for very good reasons, because they dare not ?
make any objedt ions to that virtuous anddiflinguijh- '
ed citizen ; it is trne that the friends of order aud 1
good government and its government have set up n
Mr. Pinckney with Mr. Adams and that the friends P
of Jefferfon can fay nothing againll him : but does 11
1 not this writer, who is in the secrets of the other c
party, know that they don't intend to vote for
tg, . him, thnt their trtket is JiJJerson and Burr, and ''

THE Minifterof tfce French Republic, in his "

y declared that France means to consider hcrfelf as to â¢'
us, in the fame situation as in the year 1793. He pl
of intimates the discontent of the French nation at the I?
le eonduft of our government, for not having been Ul
lufficiently friendly, and there are people, calling
themselves Americans, who are ever ready to re-echo

their charges. The following cxtrtft from his let

[t-b motion of our national prefperity.
â¢ ft. The firft. ctrcumllarice which strikes us, in read
}s. ing the introductory letter to the speaker of the
in- reprefentativos on transmitting the report, is the
ft. bringing tip the report only to the trmc, when
a t tilings, as the reporter fays, were in their fettled
ca - order, that is the summer cf 1792, (when the
in monarchy of France terminated), and yet, in the
10 t fame letter, informing the reprefrntatives that
France had proposed to enter into a ne*U treaty of
to commerce witisthe United >States r on liberal ,
iv- Â»-nd had, in the me.in time, relaxed femp of her
[fy commercial restraints ; nil of which fufls were sv b- i
rr n SEQUENT to the period at which he hdcl os s d hit ]
en report. ,
m Now, as he had fixed upon a ceitaln period, at
. r . which it was proper to cli>fe his report, for the 1
(, e reason he had afligned, namely, becaufc it was ims
poflible to dtferibe all'the changes which the war t
,y t had occasioned, aud because the report was pro- r
) Je perly adapted to a time, when things were in their j:
vc Jetthd order, he certainly ought rro: 10 have intro- i
r _ duced the commercial measures of France, julttÂ« t]
3t cuent to that period; or if he did, he ought like p
I. wife tohaveflited all the changes which bad fubfe
l(j quently taken place in the meafuie* of the other *
,p nations, he ought also have ftatrd that since that si
period, France had brele her cxifling treaty with j (1
eg 11s; inftir.d of which, he rcmaiks, that to have! g
Â»r endeavored to have described nit these changes would "
}r have been asendlefs as useless, since thefcenes would t(
lt j have been (hifting while under description. He e
r . mast have well known that the liberal treaty ti
proposed by France required that we should be- r
come a party in the war; he mull have well .
known that this proposal of a new treaty ciroft al- w
together out of the then exijling war, and was in
therefore no more a circumstance connefled with b
the settled order of things, than any other war meaâ  ft
j 5 sure of the other belligerent power. tf
Here in the very introduction then of his report, pi
0 fee departs altogether from the plan laid down, on if
f purpose to impress cungrefs with a belief that
e France was difpefed to a liberal treaty with fp
n us, when he knew (what Genet's cbliflied UJruc- w

Mr. Pinno,
A WRIFER in your piper under the affiKii>d

. Negro (laves of the United Srates, and weakly a'*
| 'eraptf to remove theincotifjlendes which Phuctvn M
charged him with on that (Ã¼bjtft. Let uÂ« cxMâ¢

feriur race if animals, and at another, aÂ» being c
to the whits. Now llie writer Â»Jmih ihe te"""

teiior to oufeli'eÃ in the present powers ot ' " lf
minds, it is hiely humane, and tntjiuuttmom 10 P r "pose For them the elevating condition of political
freedom."
The writer evades the second part of the charge,
which mark* Mr. Jefferfon's inconsistency, viz. Lis
letter to Banneker, the Negro, wherein he assert* the
equality of the natural genius of the black* with
the white* ; he i* totally Went in refpeft to that fa
mous letter, which was a direct contradiction to his
opinions, exprefled in the note* on Virginia ; but
he proceed* to explain Mr. Jeffetfon's emancipati
on scheme, which he telis us was only to operate
in favor of the posterity of the Negroes. This ex
piai.nti.in makes the matter worse, a* far as it would
hÂ«v. afc-fted the interefb of the Southern states :
the pirfent holder* of (laves would not thank Mr.
Jefferfon for leaving them all the old, ftiperannua
tc< -['<*. useless Negroes, and liberating all the voting ,
and ui'cfui or.es ; such a scheme woulJ be indeed a . , ,
Â«eP'ifvation of the injury. What piov/Tion is a '
Souihern planter, whoGe whole wealth is derived ' i
from Haves, to make for his children, if =11.the I ]
young Negroes are to be set free, as soon as born, j |
or at the age, when they begin to be ufeful, and all , <
the old Negroes are to be left on the estate as a bur- ;
den ? If Mr. Jefferfon's scheme is to take place, (
much Letter to liberate them all at once, old and t
young. c
The writer next attempt* to apologize for Mr. c
Jefferfon'* ttanfportation projefi, by alfcrtiag that
there was to be no feiziog and (hipping and bind- t
ing, but they were merely to be colonized, he does g
not fay where, but thinks the interior part of Vir- f,
ginia or Kentucky: this, however, by no means fl
agrees with Mr. Jeffeifon's views, for he expressly p
fays in his Nates, p. 154, "the Have, when freed, g
mud be removed beyond the reach of mixture;"
and thereforecolonieing them into the isterior parts
of Virginia would not prevent the evil apprehend
ed, that of staining the Wood of the white*. If
is evident then that his object was to (hip them to
fomeforeign eeuntry, that it wasfome projefillike
that afterwards adopted by the Sierra Leone com
pany, who sent a number of free persons to the
v eoaft of Africa, where many of them miserably
peri(hed.âThe term Colonizing impoits a fend,
ing to some remote country ; and the other part of
this wild projedl, namely, " the fending veflels, at
the fame time, to other parts of the world for an si
equal number sf white inhabitants," clearly con- w
firms it. The idea was, to fend of these emanci- h
pated black children in the vessels which were to F
bring back an equal number of whites. This very r<
Extravagant proieft the apologifi dwell* on as an F
evidence of Mr. Jefferfon'* humanity and mae;nani- d
mity. The black children, it i* to be observed, t;
were to be, against their cohfeot, feparatcd frcm g
their parents, and colonized to fame dillant region P
Suppose they rcfufed to go, mud they not be feix- w
ti, bound and compelled to go ?âlf not, the ai
proje<a would fall through ; and to complete the t<
humanity and magnanimity of this noble scheme, d'
the poor old parents, thus bereft of their children, R
were to remain in slavery, deprived of that which
â¢lone can render old age comfortable, the aid and fl'
company of their children. 01
Such was the pr. jea of this great p 1 ilofopher, si

The writer attempt* to retort the charge of in- b<
confiflency on Phpcion, for accusing Mr. Jrfferfon cii
atone time of degrading the blacks, attd at anorher
of lefriending them : Piiociori stated the fa 3, to (hew
Mr. Jefferfon's inconsistency ; the truth is that Mr.
Jefferfon has injured his chara&er with many of the
friends of abolition by his degrading opinion of the
black*, and he has alarrped many of the Southern
citizens by his projed of emancipation ; andthtts
it alway* is with inconjijlent charters, who aim at
pleafmg every bodyâihefe half-way politicians mult
, count upon perpetually ititangling 1 hcmfelves in con- ,
traditions. ">
The writer is furpriÂ«d that Mr. Jefferfon Iksiild fÂ°
ke censured for wishing to emancipate the blacks, |"
when all the Southern dates, except Georgia, have
prohibited the (lave trade. Does this writer sup- J l "'
pose that the people of those states are so blind, as
not to fee the difference between prohibiting the im
portatton of any more slaves, and emancipating those
already in the comitry ? Mr. Jefferfon, he tells us,
had proposed an article in the Declaration of Inde
pendence, censuring the king* of Gieat-Britain for Â°[
annihilating the American laws to prohibit the flave
trade. Mr. Jefferfon carried the firfl law in Vir- d<
ginia for abolifting the slave trade. Mr. Jefferfon 1,1
in conformity with the equal birth rights of men! f"
prepofed in Virginia a plan for emancipating all "j
slaves born after passing ,h e Admit all this, f 1
yet the fame Mr. Jefferfon did propose that, when b .-
freed, they (hould be transported or colonized to
some d.ftant region, beyond the reach of mixture. "

sn French army retiring towards the Rhine, after Jour- w
11- d.m's check, the Imperial army had advanced and cs
d, taken pofl'eflion of Frankfort. The other 1 letter
m gave it as the report of the day, that the king of
n Pruflia and the prince of HefTe Cafie! had declared '
z- war against the Emperor. The Northern French
be army, which was in Holland, had received orders
tc to reinforce Jourdan. In consequence of these or
