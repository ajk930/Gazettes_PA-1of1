A very valuable Merchant Mill,
A DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and sundry STONE
QUARRIia to be let 1
I will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po
towmac, for any term not less thanfeven, nor more than a
eleven years, from the firft day of September next. The
milUhouf is 4 i by 40 feet, three stories high, huilt with
stone, and has in it three pain of French Burr Stones, two
overlnot iS feet wattr wheels, and Evans's machinery
complete, with every other thing proper and necessary fÂ»r
carrying on the bofineft with dispatch, and at as little ex
pense as poflibfe, all in good orderâFrom the mill to my
landing on the Fstomac river, (whs re craft, of any bur
then may dÂ«liver grain and take in flour) it is about 40 ,
yards, and from thence by water to George-Town and ,
the City of W alhingtos, about 3 miles, and to Alexan- r
dna about 11 miles. This situation, aided by a fufficient a
capital, will command the produce of a very extensive t
back country, where large quantities of wheat and other c
grain is annually made, the distance to it beinij from 8 '
to to miles less than to any raaiket town up.-hi the navi- J
gat ion of tile Potowirac. TheÂ»e are on the premises a
large done Coopers' flup, a stone granary, .and a commo
dious miller's house. At the landing aforefaid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, which is in great for
wardnefsand probably will be finifhedthe ensuing fall.
There are also on the premises, a Brewery and Distille
ry, built with stone, in them are three stills, two co f .pcrs
or boilers, with every nesefiUry article, aU new, and in
good order, and fufficiently large to carry on the Brew
ery and Diftillsry upon a very extensive plan. This prop
erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
Upoii my lands adjoining the premises, and along the
banks Of the river, where craft may iead with ease and dis
patch, is an inmejife q iantlty of building and founda
tion-Hones. Four, quarries are bow open, and as many
more may be opened with ease : the stone taken from thefc
quarries is better, and kas the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it. I will reut these quarries f
separately or tog -< her as may best suit.
On the top of the hill, and about 100 yards from the
mill, is a stone Dw'elling-houfe, large enough for the ac- r
eommodation of a family : also, a kitchen, dairy, fmeke
boufe, &x. and a garden, ene ofed and in cultivation, the \
foiof which is equal in goodness to any in this state. I ~
will also rent this property.
Adjoining to the Brewery and Distillery is a Smith's i
ihop, in which is a complete set of BUckftnith's tools, f
which I will aifc rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
tenant two negro blackiiniihs, one of them is 3. complete
workman. â¢
li I rent out the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts, 1
which were built for the purpose of carrying stone : they' c
will altogether bring upwards of. 90 perch. ,Immediate j
possession will be given. For terms apply to the fubferib
, er in t(at town. '
The Mill, Brewer)-and Distillery, withthe'r appurten- j
mccs, will be delivered to the tenant or tenants in good
repair, and muff be so returned, at the expiratien of the
lease or Icafcs.

COURT OF KING'S BENCH, JUNE IJ.
LE"W!S Vi AICOCK.
,Mr. Garrow dated this to be an action brought
for damages for a violent aflault committed'on the
plaintiff by Mr. Alcock, upon the huttings, at the
late election for the borough of Southwark, where
he had acted ns agent for Mr. Tierney , and, at
I he was then in Court, the Jury perceive,
from bulk and strength, that be was a
person oVer whom the plaintiff could have but lit
tle chance of faccefs, if. he had made any lefilt- â¢
1 auce.
1 The immediate confluence of this attack made
f by the friend of the popular candidate was, that
' the mb called out to have Mr. Lewis th.row(i down
from the huttings among them. .Tile jury ought,
therefore, by the damages they (hould give, todif
> countenance any proceedings at an <j!e<3ion that
went to hold up any man as an objedl of vengeance
' to a mot.
Mr. Carpenter Smith and Mr. Broadley, two
for the county of Surrey, who attend
â  ed at the hulftnus as-the friends of McfT. ThornÂ»
1 ton and ThellufTon, said, that ihey saw the de
fendant collar the plaintiff, for the purpose of drag
ging hifti away from the huttings, lifting that,
as he was not an eledor, nor a clerkt, he had no
right to be- there. Upon this the plaintiff was ap
pointed a check cleik, that,he might be qualified
to remain where he was, and aflitt Mr. Thornton.
' Mr. Thornton was then called ; he said the plain
tiff did attend th? hufttiTgs at the desire of his af
tifttng cotftmittef tnatl..
Mr. Brfkine made an able speech for the defend
ant ; he thought the fuccefsful candidates ought to
have been contented v. ith gaining their eleSion,
1 and not have forwarded such a contemptible aftiotr
as the present agaijilt the agent of Mr. Tierney.
Th#plaintiff had no right to go to the Huttings,
as not being a voter; by doing so, he becafne one
of the mob ; and the right to Choose Reprefenta
> tivtg in this free country mud be done awav, if un
1 qualified men, who thus intermeddled in elections
1 were not exchlded. He cotild not deny that an as
fault had been committed, according to law ; but
> it . was of such a nature, add ""attended with such
1 circumttances, that he trusted not more than one
(hilling damages would be given.
Aftei two or three words from Lord Kenyon,
the jury retired, and remained deliberating for a
cijofiderable time: at length they gave a vevdift
i for the plaintiff damages ONE SHILLING.
; June 17.
GOObCHILB V. rit-tiTOH.
1 This action was brought by the plaintiff, \vho
â  lives at Walton-upon-Thames, to recover ithe sum
i of- iool.
Mr. Garrow, who opened this Cafe, observed,
he had been informed the defendant was a mer
chant of the city of -London, thbogh he could
hardly believe it. The ctrcumflaUces of the cafe
wete fingiilar, and such as, for the honor e>( thevity
of London, were seldom heard of in Guildhall.
In confluence of some previous acquaintance
the plaintiff one day called upon the defendant and
found him very much out of fpiritv He enquired
the can ft; of it. Mr. Preflon told him he had
t been disappointed. The comrtiiflioners of the ex
cise had refufed topay him for fome'rum, and un.
less he could r:ife 200!. in thecourfedf that clay,
be was afiaid he {hould be ruined. Upon' that,
the pUiatiff took a piece of paper and immediately
give him 2 Jtaft upon his bankers for the fan of
r \ jool- This money was '<&> be returned m the ip::CL
of fix week). The defendant was fu (truck tfith -
that asor generality, that he infixed he mic-htbe i
â¢vj # ;itted to give Mr. Gondchild fame fccurity for
the re-payflient of it. The plaintiff ioid him he >
wanted no security, and if lie did not thi .k bun s -
man of honour, on wbofevrord lie could fafely re- <
Iv, he would not trust him on his bond. When i
the fix weeks had elapsed, the plaintiff called on
the defendant for his money. Mr. Preston .told him i
it was inconvenieat at that time to pay it ; but !
prosnifed'over and over again te pay it. A< laÂ«, .
however, to the utter astonishment of the plaintiff,
Mr. Preston had the boldness to tell him he had (
neyer lent him any mo'iey ; that he had never been I
hit creditor for a farthingi and that he wouL not
pay him. .
The learned cotmfel ohferved, if he fore this cause i
Was brought, the defendant had any charaftfir that
was of to him, he would footi fee wheiher he
had made a pood bargain in this cafe, by endea
vouring to fhift off the payment cf tins.ffloney.
The draft was paid by the plaintiff's bankers. â 
He fair*, he (hould lay such a body of evidence be- i
fdre the juty, that if it were a fjueftion, whether (
Mr. Preston had dole that draft which he had re- !
eefved from the plaintiff, and were to be fubje&ed i
to a capital ptlviiflnnent for the Sealing of it, he <
coulc! have no possible defence. He should prove <
thnt draft was paid to the defendant by the piain- j
tiff's bankers On the day on which it was dated â- t
He.(hould (hew by what bank note they had paid J
it. He Ihould (hew that that bank note, on the
fame day, was carried to Mr. Prefto'i's baiiker ; (
and he should tfiat" it came into his bank- |
er's hands through his (Mr. Prettoir's) hands that
day. If necessary, he colild identify that bank
note still farther. j
This was as gross an inltance of ingratitude as (
ever appeared in a Court of Justice. There Was j
also a bill in Chancery on this bufisefs, but the j
defendant fvvore through it.
One of ;he clerks of Messrs. Langfton and Co.
(aid Mr. Goodchild kept money at their house ; 1
and that on the 30th of O&oSer, 1794, they paid :
the plaintiff's draft with the bank note 7Â°4> '
dated O&ober 20th, 1794. The draft was here
read, and was in tbefe words: " London, Odto- ;
b?r 30th, 1794, pay Mr. Thomas-Preiton or bear. 1
er two nundied poilnds." Â« I
One of the clerks of Messrs. Prefcot and Co. j
find Mr. Preston kept money at their house ; that (
in the afternoon of O&ober 30, J 794, they reÂ» ]
ceived through the hands of the defendant, the 1
bank-note Na. 704. The learned edunfel was pro- 1
ceeding Aill farther in his proof, when the noble |
and learned judge aiked what answer was to be â¢
given to this cafe ? 1
Mr. Mingay, counsel for the defendant, said he <
had no witness.
Lord Kenyon said, there Was then an end of it,' 1
To be fute such a cafe was never brought into a â¢
court of juflice Verdict for plaintiff, including
1 two years interest, 2161. ,

EDWARD GIBBON, ES<^
THIS great hidorian, descended from an anci- ,
ent family in the wilds of Kent, was born at Put- J
ney in Surry, on the Bth of May, 1737. His in
fancy was marked by great coiporeal weakness and j
infirmity ; but an attachment to arithmetick, at a
very early period, which rendered him capable cf
multiplying and dividing two ferns of fevtral figures '
by memory alone, seems to have,denoted a vigorous '
mind. His education was partly received at home,
partly at Bath, and other places, where he resided
for the reftoraiion of his health, and partly at Weft,
mii>fter. In April 175 2, he went to Oxford,
where he remained but a Ihort time, in consequence I
of his having embraced the Roman CathtJic reli- (
gion. He was now sent to Lausanne, in Switaer- ]
land , where, under the t'uition of Mr. Pavllliard, a
Calvinift minister, he was not only made a*good
claCical scholar, but teftored to the Protestant faith.
To this bani(hment, Mr. Gibbaa acknowledges
that he owed whatever has been the fruits of his
education. He returned to his falher, who was
now retired to his feat at Buriton, Hants, in 1758 ;
and was received with every mark of parental af
fection. After tefiding at home about five years,
during which time he became a captain "of the
Hampshire militia, his father heing major, he a
gain vifcted the continent, and made Hie tour of
France and Italy. It was while he fat contem
plating amidst the ruins of the capital of Rome, on
the evening of the 15th of Oitober, that
that the idea of writing the Decline and Fall of
that city, firft started to his tnind. More mature
deliberation extended it to the Fall of the Roman 1
Empire, which he has so nobly completed in his fix '
volumes, 4he three last of which Were publifted on '
1 the 5 tft aOniverfaFy of his birth-day, May, 1783.
, Tlie greater part of this wojk was completed dur- !
ing a retirement of some.years in Switzerland, after
f the abolition of*lhe Board of Tt*de, of wliich'M;.
Gibbon, then in Parliament had been appointed
1 one of the Lords Cummifli.iners, by the recoin
mendartion of Lord Chancellor Loughborough.

Yeftetdav between the hoars of one and two, a
man was arretted in the PaWe,of Equality, of the
name of Jourden, who.had diftingt:i!hed himfelfas

formerly drum major to the Revolutionary afTy, and
is said to be 1 elated tw the celebrated Jourdan

parted (ince that period, has not, however been loft
to the public: it has beeYi devoted to the prepara
tiorr of a civil code, a work of great extent and con*
fiderable importance, which is now in the Press, and
which will be the .mean's of destroying 'hat motkjr
legislation, which resulted from the caprice of the
various factions which alternately cquvulfed thecon*

the name of the legislative body. The party of

It is with a degree of forrov seldom experience!
" by the editor hereof, that he enters upon the rect
> tal of the following melancholy event. âA fewdayt
1 -ago an unhappy difputetook place al Bath, between
a Captain Randolph and another gentleman, whole
name we have not heard ; that a challenge was lent
1 by th<; latter to the formpr, of which a Captaia
1 Thomas was the beareÂ» j that Captain refilled
the challenge, and threw the note on the ground,
fignifying at the fame time, that he did not think
1 his opponent upon an equality with him. The'be
haviour of Captain R. irritated Captaia Thomss,
who also dared him to combat, which was refuted
by the former on the fame score. A day or two
afterwards, Captain Thomas was boasting in com
' pany that he had frightened some of the Caritincri
' talsâThis behaviour drew down the vengeance of
M?.jor Blackburn,'who very uiifoitunately happen
ed to be present i his refcntment knew no bounds.*â
He assailed Captain ThomaÂ«, and (Oh! that we
" could break off here ( but, alas ! thefequel, mourn*

period to h'sexillencel The unhappy Major Black
burn is committed to prison at Martiolhurgh.

is no regular issuing of ration9,clothing or other sup

magazines established whereevera body of troops is
stationed, every artiqlc they want.and appTy for, lo

cloathing, bread, meat, brandy, &c. as they want
them, in such quantities as they plcafcâand being
fully fed and supplied, contented and hap

Communication of his Excellency the Governor to ''
the Hon. the General Assembly of this state. P
Gent(emen of the Senate and of the l/oufi of S
Representatives,
The short time in which I conceived it was ne
ceffirily (ny to canvene the legislature, com
pelled me to, call you togetheivon so short a notice.
In the firft inltance, was to give all the )â¢
time, the emergency of the occasion ;vnuld admit '
of ! And in the fecorid, from a circumstance, that j R
the eledion to be held for representatives was ap- I ?
proaching so near at hand, made it necessary, as I l
conceive, for the assembly to it in their power,
by a timely meeting {should they in their wisdom ,
deem it proper) to make an alteration in the aÂ£t â¢
diieAing the mode of deling reprefentatiires to re- Â°
prtfeÃt this state in the s Congress of the United
blates, before the day of eleÂ£iion fhHuld arriye, as
dtTeiledin the aforefaid aft, othcrwife it might be r
attended with disputes and contentions of a difa- '
greeable nature S for by a late a & of Congress the \ Â»
intended number of our representatives is diminish- 1
ed, of' couife it proportionally lessens our number 1
of electors for President and Vice-President of the |
U"' tec l States. Thus such a derangement will rie- j â¢
cefTtrily require an alteration in our adls passed for '
such purposes.
Our senators not being recognised in the Senate '
of the United Slates, is another matter for your
jonfideration and attention: And for your more '
ample information, the feverai aflg and communica- J
tions accompanying this address, will elucidate unto'
yap propriety ef my calling the affemfely toge
ther at this time, " * (
1 I hope be permitted toobferve, that it is '
of importance, and conducive to public happiness 1
to aYrange our acts conformably wiih those of Con
. grefs, so far as they fcall refped this state.
' The foregoing are the reasons why 1 have
thought proper to convene the affombly in session,
or. the present day : And I make no doubt, you !
1 will, through your paternal care, wifdem, and pa--
â¢ tr.iotic deliberations, adopt fitch meafwres as wilj
; tend to promote the public interest and ger.eral uti- |
â lity of the state.
I have the pleasure of announcing to you; gen- '
tlemen, the admiflion of the state of Tern effee into
) the federal union, a eircumftance, pregnant with
r every flattering proCjjcdt of peace, happineit, in'd
t opulence to our fofant state. The period is at
; length arrived, when the people of the &outh Wrf
- tern Territery may enjoy all the blessings and 1 *r
- ties of a free and independent republic.
s Permit me to Â«i(h your public, domeftic,.and in
1 dividual happiness,
c While I have the honor to be,
/ Very refpedlfully,
Your devoted and .
Obedient servant,
JOHN SEVIER.

. To his Excellency JQHN SEVIER, ,Esq. Gover
f. of the slate ps TmneJTee.
0 S,R >
.. We are fully sensible that the important obieas
by you laid before this General Assembly, made it
neceffaiy for you to convene the legislature at this
" time.
_ We rejoice with you in the event of this state be
.J. '"g firm 'y admitted into the federal union ; and our
1 minds are filled with the most pleaf.ng sensations,
:r when we teflrft on the prosperity and political hap.
pi ess to whiih we view it as a certain prelude :
Be uffured, fir, it will be our firil and greatest eare
to adopt such measures as will promote the true
interest of this state, as connected with the Ame
-1 ritan union.
With refpefl to our reprefentatton in the senate
t8 of the United States in patticuiar, we flatter our
selves such steps have been taken, that no 'reason
it now remains fuffirient to juftify tjiat body jn refu
(ing any Jbngetf to recognile oar senators.
We view it as effencially necessary to the preser
vation of peace and harmony, with the Indian
if tribes, that the constitutional treaties and laws
tliould be duly observed : And we have the fulleft
confidence that the executive of this state will take
proper measures to enforce their due execution.

By the Peggy, Capt. Bunce, in 40 days from "
Hull,' we h-ive London accounts to the evening of} e .
the 13th July ; being three days later than the ad- rn "
vices by Capt. Clay, lately arrived at Philadelphia t " 1
from Hamburgh. Theanoft iSiportant articles are
the defeat of the Auftrians by General Moreau,
(ince his crofiingjhe Rhine; and the continued ap- C 1
prehensions of a rupture between Great-Britain and
Spain.
. LONDON, Jaly 13â14. Lo
This morning the mail arrived frtm Hamburgh,
whi. h was due last Sunday. The accounts confirm froi
the statements given in the Jaft Paris papers, re- por
fpetting the eroding of the Rhine at Strasbourg in 1
and Kehl, and give other particulars reXpetting the tail
operations of the Auftrians, and the alarm that pre
has been fprcad in all the countries along the Rhine
by the pr&gVefs of the French. tra
The Auftrians having been obliged to abandon Ofl
1' ribourg, in Brifgau, fcrm to have no choice left abl
but to retreat (for.fighting seems now to be out of evi.
th< qneftinn) into th; Black Forest, by what is sos

| ihe Arch-duke, with part of his army, left the in'
; Lahn, iniending, it would appear, to prevent the hai
F tench from getting over at Strasbourg, but, the noi
i Republicans having been too quick in their opera- dei
; tions to lie prevented by the arrival of Austrian re- j mo
inforcements from such a di/lance, this movement
on the part of the Arch-duke will be one means coi
of them to re-e(lablifh themselves. tea
The French, by the lale movements, have ren- I _
dered all tlicir portions muchr more secure than they
were a fhÂ»rt time ago, and it will require great mi- ff
â¢ litary (kill on the part of the jmperialifts to prevent
thon from profiting by the cireumllancc; for not
. onljr has the army of the Sambre and Meufe re
ceived great reinforcements from that of the North,
f.s we have already (hated, but a junttion has been Ec
formefi by the right wing of Jourdan's army, and St
the left of General Moreau'a. Cc
It 1$ probable that the purpose of the French is â c<
to pftieti'atc through Suabiaon one fide, and thro' C
the Valteline, the country of the Grifons and
Tirol cn the ether. If they fucceedl in this, the ? c ,
army rF Italy, which has already advanced so farâ¢ m
on that fide as to have its advanced polls on the an.
fouthfrn mountains of Germany, will be enabled
to effe& a junction with that of the Rhine. The
French armies, when thus united, will extend to SI
the German oeean on the left, and to the Mediter-
J ranean on the light It is noreafy to fee at present
any tiling that can prevent them from executing
this vast projett, which will open to them the heart '
of Germany,'and compel the Emperor to fiae for
peace on any terms. B
An article from Bonn of June 24, ftatea, that
the news is confirmed, of the French having taken ?
the lines before Memzr: This intelligence, howe
ver, merits further confirmation, before it can be P
implicitly credited. in
Private letters from the Imperial army state, that hi
the Prince of'Wirtemberg has been summoned to o\
Vienna to give an account of the Â«Â« ball at. which l a
General Lefehvre made him pay the piper."
c From Italy, the mail brings little intelligence of, B
importance, it confirms the news of an armistice
having been concluded between the French M<;. c<
public and the King of Naples. 2
i Some malcontent# at Rome have planted the tree
Of Liberty there. The ringleaders have been ap- c:
prehended. Y

: The intelligence brought by the Crptain of the

' * By accounts received from the different parts of the
Continent as well as from Europe, where the tickctt
have been Cent'for sale, the public are assured that the
drawing will speedily ccriiimenee, and that the care and
caption unavoidably neceflary to iniure a fafe disposal of
the tickets, has rendered the Chor. suspension indispensable.
