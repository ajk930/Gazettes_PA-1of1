treaty of amity,commerce a*dnavigation4eon
ciuded between his Britannic majesty and tke Urited
â¢States of Amtfiea, Â«n the 19th day of November,
1794, having this day conltituted tlteir Board,
pursuant and agreeably to the said treaty, do here
by give notice, that they arcxeidy to proceed to
business accordingly; andthey desire that all claims
under the said article (which so far asthe fame de
scribes the cases thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary, with*
out delay.
They further desire that all such claims may not
only state in what manner the several cases come
within the deferiptiou of the said article, but also
fpecial'y set forth .he nature of the evidence by
which the claimants refpeitively undertake tefuh*
ftantiate the fame.
Exjra<sfc from thfe said article,
" Whereas it is alledged by divers Britifti mer
" chant?, and others his majesty's fubje&s, thaC
" debts to a confidt rablu amount, which were bona
" fide contraded, before the peace, still remain
" owing to them by citizens or iahabitants of the
44 United States ; and that by the operation of va
w rious lawful impediments, since the peace, not
44 only the full recovery of the said debts has been
44 delayed, but also the val*ie and security thereof
" have been in several instances impaired and leff
-44 ened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial
44 proceedings, the British creditors cannot now
44 obtain and a&ually have and receive full and
il adequate compenfution for the losses and darua-
M ges which tney have thereby fufcained: It is a
-44 greed that in all such cases where full compenfa
u tion for such losses and damages cannot for what
-44 ever reason be a&ually obtained, had and recei
" ved by the said creditors in the ordinapy 'course
44 of justice, the United States will make full and
" complete compensation for the fame to the said
<c creditors : but it is diftin&ly understood, that
this provision is to extend to such losses only as
t( have been occasioned by the lawful impediments
u aforefaid, and is not to extend to losses occafion
-44 ed by such infolventy of the debtors or other
" caufcs, as would equally have operated to pro
u duce such loss, if the said impediments had not
44 existed ; nor to furh losses or damages us have
â¢â¢ been occasioned by the manifeft delay, or neglii
'â¢ j,encc, or wilful omiflion of the claimant.*'

r HE SUBSCRIBER having been appointed by
the Envoy Extraordinary and Miniller Pleni
potentiary of his Britannic Majesty, General Agave
{or aflifting British creditors, and such particular'a
gents as they may specially authorize, in prosecuting
their claims before the cÂ«mmiflioners for carrying in
to effefl tine sixth article ot the Treaty of Amity. Com
merce and Navigation between his Britannic Majcjly and
the United States of America, hereby gives nonce that
he has opened his office at his koufc the south east
corner of Chefnut and fiftU streets, Philadelphia,
where he is ready to receive all claims or inttru&ioni
for claims with the vouchers aud documentÂ® thereof,
lor the purpose of bringing forward the fame agree
ably so the rules and orders which the board may
think proper to prescribe.
And as it will be for the interest of al! concerned,
that the several claims be so stated, and support
ed, as to prevent the delay which would arile from
the neceflityof obtaining further information, or ad*
ditional materials,from persons residing at a distance,
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the
dire&ion chiefly of thofr, who, not having employ
ed particular agents, may leave the prosecution of
their claims to his charge and management) that all
such claims ought in particular to set forthâ
Â»ft. The proper defcripiiou and fitnation of the
creditor or claimant, end original debtor, refpeÂ£U
ively.
sd. The date or nature of the original contrail or
debt.
3d. When, in what manner, and to what extent,
the creditor or claimant w*s prevented or impeded,
by the provision, operation or defeat of law, the
decisions and practice of courts, or restraint of exe
cution, from recovering payment of the debt i.i
question.
4th. The loss and damage incurred or sustained,
in tonfequence of such impediments, whether rhe
fame may have trifen from the infolveney, change of
fuuation, or dei h of the debtor, the iofs ot legal
remedy from lapse of time, or othercaufes impsirieg
the value and hcurityof the debt, which would not
have (0 operated if such imped jments had not existed.
And sth Tiie particular grounds and reafens on
which the claimant maintains, in the terms of the
treaty, that 41 bythe ordinary course of judicial pro
r ings, the creditor cannot now obtain and a&ually
e have and receive full and adequate compensation" lor
the losses and ages so fuftdiued.
3 The generaixgent thinks it his duty further to f*Â£-
geft that the frvoial claims ought 10 be accompanied
and fupportcd by the sfftdavits of the claimant* duly
sworn and rcguiariy atiefted, both as to the existence
of the debts cliimed, and such other circumstances
as may ba within their own knowledge relpettively.
\n& wherever the claimants in the nature of
their evidence (which must in every tdftaqce be the
best ot which the cafe is capable) have occasion to
lefer to the testimony of witnesses, it will be proper
to a^priÂ£e the general agent of the names and places

HOUSE or fcEPREsEtfTATIVE3, " r "
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 14.' fell
r Concluded from T 'rarfd'ty j if t
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) denied that p Â«i
the debtor States were deprived of any as- pe<
iftance from the sum already agreed to be bll
appropriated generally. If the gentleman
hoi read the firft clause of the bill he had , t(<
differed his -warmth to overcome his memary, , j| (
as he there mull fee this wrt.i not the cafe.â ' (h.
With refpeft to obtaining a ctffion of the ' tU
three islands upon which the fortification* J<3
at New 7"ork were ertfted, he would not bc
agree tb appropriate twenty cents for that â¢
pnrpofe i nor did he believe the State of fl]
New Tort would ever cede them. Mr. D. (,t
said, it was yesterday observed that an odi- ft;
ous diftin&ioa was made' with refpeft to th
New fork, because not provided for; and
now provision was made for her, gentlemen c(
still talked of odious diftin&ions. He did
not know what gentlemen would be fatisfied p
with. " Ik
Mr. D. said, living near New 2"ork, as tn
he did, hehad frequent opportunities of con- et.
verftng with the people of that city on this lL
fabjeft, and so far from a proposition of this e
kind being considered as an insult .to that
State, he believed it would be highly grati- N
fying to them. Nay, the Representatives at
of that State had assured him last fef&on, in v
converfalion, that if an offer like the pre
sent came frorfi Cor.grefs ft would be well
received. Every oc? of them said this, but
they did not wiih taenifelves to propqfe it, r Â£
because it might be fuppafed they pledged
the State to accept the offer, when they had a i
Uo authority to do so. He had not heard
an individnal fay it would not be well re- d
ceived, and he could fee no ground for the '*
present opposition. a
Mr. Swan Wick. thought the amendment a
good one. He believed the state of Pennsylva
nia would be glad to difehafge their debt tothe b
United State* in this way. f
Williams doubted r.ot the assertion of j
the gentleman from New-Jersey might be just (
aj to the citizens of New-Yorjc, but they werÂ« j.
r.ot so with refpefl to other parts of that Rate, t
and the representatives in the legislature cfme f
chiefly from the weft and north of New-York
er. Harpi* did not think it material.to .in- ' c
quire into the dispositions of the people of the (
citv or country of New-York, on this occasion- (
The quellion was whether it was expedient to .
make the present propositionâHe thought it j
was ; for it it were acceded to on the part of (
New-York, great good would be doneâif not, .
no harm could be the consequence. (
Mr. BReoKrs thought he knew the minds of (
his cor.fytuents better than the gentleman from (
New Jersey. He hatMieen in the legislature of (
New York for three years past, which he belie- (
Ved was the heft polfible situation for learning
the political opinions of the (lite. He bel*eved
a propefitten of this kind would not be well re
ewved he called it an invidious
from their-lifter dates ; It was- to fay to them,
If you do nit fay your debt (<whtch ivc fay is
jufl, but â¢iv/jtebyou Ji/pute) youfhtll not be pro
titled. -'
Mr. Dayton again charged the memory of
the gentleman from New Yoik with not being
faithful, and juftified his former assertion.
Whtu the blink came to be filled tip he f.id he
meant to pi opofe it to be filled with the sum of
1,200,c0c, the debt affutred for the state of
New York ; but, if he believed a proposition
of this kind"would beeonfivlered as an insult to
that state or people, he would be the lalt to sup
port it.
Mr. Havens believed with the gentleman
from New-Jtrfey, that the proposition would not
be considered as an insult, but lie wn doubtful
whether it would be accepted, because there was
a prevailing opinion in thit state that the fettle
went betwixt the Rates'and the United States
bad not been fair, as it related to them, and
that therefore the western representation would
oppose such an appropriation.
Mr. Elmendorf was against the araend
* ment. The principle upon â Â« hicli the hotife had
proceeded was, general proteilion arising from a
ienfe of danger, ai.d that therefore those plac
es which were weakest and most expoied had a
primary claim upon their notice, without rel
peA to cefiion or any other secondary objtdl ;
but, instead of this, the question fecmed to be a
contest between different parts o! the Union and
the State of New York. He did not himfelf
think there was any occasion for extraordinary
measures ; but, as it had been other wife conclu
ded, he thought New York was entitled tft e
qual attention with others, and ouglit npt to be
pointed at m the way proposed. For, said he,
if the ref#lution paflesit w ill not insure the bu
siness being done, because the legislature of
New York might not agree to it. He there
fore thought that the mealurf was an excommu
nication of that Sute from the general protec
tion prppofed.
Mr. Sitgrfavss w'.lhed to offer a substitute
to the fedlion under; consideration ; which he
liÂ»d reafoa to believe would prove generally ac
ceptable. It was to the following effeaâ" And
be it further enacled, that the Prcfident of the
United States be authorised tocaufe to be creel
ed at the Narrcws, such fortifications as he may
deem necessary for the proteflion of the port
and harbor of New York, provided that thc-ex-
Jttnce thereof do not exceed dt liars.
And be it further eua3ed, that the sum of
aoo,eoo dollars expended in tne present fortifi
cations in that pert, be pissed to the credit of
the balance found due from the state* of New-
YOrk to the United States, and that so much as
fliall remain of the said balance shall be appro
priated 'for- the pnrpofe of foiiilying the Nar
rows as aforefaid."
Mr. Havins did not approve of this amend
neti:. .Theafiumtd debt of New-York would
by no means fortify the Nairo\?s. After tak
ing off Â»00,000 dollars for the frefent forfifica
tions, there would only remain ene million,
and he believed, it would req lire three mill
ions.
Mr. Ha*?*R thought this preposition much
more hostile to the state of Ne* Yerk than thÂ«
one It fiiperceded ; a< the principle of the other
was gcoeial, and this particular. He did not
believe that th* Nirrows would be Vrtified ei
ther by the State of New-York or the United
States, at present. He thought a mVlion of
dollars might be hid out to much better pur
pose in the purcliafe ps (hips of Var ; lor, if
they weir to go into t fyfttin of general fvtifi
eativn of the eoaft, one hundred millioiu of
dpllars would at least be fceceff-ry.
Mr. Allen supported the amendment.
Mr. Â£ayard uas oppofcd to the amend
ment, because in favor of the bill, for he believ
ed if the amendment was adopted, the kill
would be loft. The amendment wit pretend
ed to be directed tÂ» one point, but was insidi
ously pointed to another. He thbrtght it impro
per, when one fo'jje<fl was tinder delate, to in-
tn#uce another totally different. lie did not I cef
come 'prepared to-day to decide on the I'i.bjeft I cor
of the dtbtor states. A queltisn of this unpor- ;j3
tauce ought net to be interwoven with any otli- ,
er. He adverted to what had taken place lafl
felhoti on the fohject of these debts, and said 01,1
if the fenatÂ« had declined an agreement to a pro- pr<
pafition so mild as that was, it could not he eX- wi'
pefted to concur in this, and, of eourle, the th:
bill would be loft. F lO
Mr. Nicholas said, if this amendment p.iff
ed, the PrtCdent would authorised iinmedi
â  ttcly to csmmence fortifications at the Narrows. m<
; He if they gave this authority, they
! Oifluld do"it underft.Yhdingly. If the prnpofi- th
' tloti frid any thing, it said, "Go on and make 6 ;
I ypnr tortificstions, and the sum cxpen ed shall
be put to your credit." But, he said, whatever
more was spent than the amount of tke debt,
the United States would have to pay. He
fliould have voted for the former proposition, P e
because he thought it would have served the
state of New York, but he could not vote for bi
this.
Mr. SitOrfaves acknowledged that if the nt
' confiruftion put upon his proportion was a jull
one, he fliould hinUelf abandon it ; but he did
not think the provision was obligttory upon the
Prefidtnt, provided the funds (hould fail. If
he (hould deem it necessary to ereift thefortifica- fti
tions in qutftion, he was authorised, not requir- th
ed, to do so. He believed there uaÂ«. always t J,
such a connexion betwixt tht authorization and
expence, as that when the fund failed, the ex
pence ceased. He fappofed, therefore, that the
President would firft enquire whether theftate of ! n
New York was willing thus to pay their bal- it
ance, and if not, he would not proceed with the tc
works. . . d'
The gentleman from Delaware had said i: u
was his (Mr. S's) intention to defeat the j
bill. He had voted in favor of fortifications; .
he had voted in favor of the higheftlum propo
sed to be appropriated sot that pnrpofe. _ a
[Mr- Bayard said he had only said that the t<
amendment would produce that etfetf.] ri
Mr S. replied, ha had not only said it was his
, design, but that it was an insidious design. He v
wilhed the coast to be effe<!lually fortified, did he
not kntw that our funds would not at present j
admit ol it ? The proposition had'two objeifls 11
in view, and he thought it would be a dcfirable e
thir.g to'accomplilh them. Indeed he did not, t
before to day, hear any obje<slion to this mea- ii
furc. Mr. S. referred to what colonel Stevens f
had said ' n favor of this mealure in the courle
1 of lalt feflion, and concluded with obrerving he
' had ntr particular fondnefs for the proposition,
' but had introduced it for the purpose of accom- c
' modation. .
, Mr. Van Aits opposed the amendment at j
â¢ confylera'ble length-. He said it was either ne- j
: ceffary to put thepcrtsand harbors cf the Unit- I .
' ed States in a llateOf defence, or it was not ; (
1 if it was not, he did not w'ifti if to be done ; but
- if it was, he insisted iipolS'its being theduty of
! the geweral government to protest YciV, '
' as well as other ports. ' But' to. ptir/ije the.con- ;
j. dufl proposed, was to fay, ,We haye fortified j
other ports, you may fortify y.Qijrfelv'es tou ]
I owe us money, do thebufinefs,.and put [Mo ac-
count." If this were doÃe, he' -believed they j â¢
(hould have no more fortificat ions than-they had |
| at present; for it seemed to be determined, New J
York must pay the debt said to be due (and he '
did net think they would be:incliucd to do it) !
II pr have no fecuritv.
!' Mr. HAvÂ£ns again fppke against the amend- j
' ment. 1
The queftipn on the firft part cf Mr. Sit- j
- greaves's prpppfition'was taken, and negatived, j
there being only lo vptes for it' -the last fell i
Â® of COUl'fc. I
'â¢ Mr. HarfKÃ then moved again the propofi
Â® tion ps Vr. Allenj as amended by Mr. Havens,
on the lirftpartof it, which was carried, there
11 being 56 votes in favor of it. The question was
0 then taken on the latter part of it, and was car
' ried, there being S3 votes for it.
The eemmittee rose, and the house were about
11 to take up the amendments, when
' Mr. Pa*ker wished to report a bill forcom
-1 pleting the frigates United States, Constitution,
is and Constellation.
e " Mr. Nicholas alfp repprted a bill directing
the apppintment ps agents in relation to the ith
!j article of the Britilh treatyi -
' Both these bills were-t jiÂ«e read, and commit
ted to committees of tire whole ; the former
j for Monday, the latter fpr to mprrpw.
On motion ps Mr. Otis, the house went in
-1 to a committee of the whole on the bill for fuf
c" pending in part the operation of-an ail passed
? last femon for raising a certain sum ot money by
additional duties. The dpmmitteÂ«;- rOfc without
' makingany other than a verbal amendment j
but a (hort t'ebate took place irrthe.houfe, and,
pn motion of Mr. Harper, the bill was rejetfed
48 to 4a.
r y The propriety of paffihjj*this bill (intended
u " to operate in of certain Massachusetts mer
-5' chants, was supported by Messrs. Otis, Brookes,
be Chainplin and S. Smith, on the ground of its
le ' unequal operation,, as it appears that the cargoes
of their vessels, of from being sev
eral months. longer 011 their voyage, will be
e " charged with the new duty, whilst those of all
lU * the other ports, frÂ»m making (horter voyages,
;c * would not be charged with it. It was opposed
by Messrs. Harper, Parker and Coit, on the
'' e ground that it would be wrong to set a law aside
Iromi complaint ps this kind, as it would o
lc" pen the dppr to petitipns without end, whenev
" er in future the least inequality pt a tax was ex-
perienced.
ay THURSDAY, JUNfIS.
irt The House proceeded to consider the a
:x* mendments agreed to in the committee of
"r the uh(ic, in the bill refpefting Fortifica
jfi. tions.
pf The firft amendment, which was to fill
w- the blank to be applied to fortifications ge
nerally with 75,000 dollars, was agreed to
ro ' 48 to 38.
ir " The. next amendment was the one intro
duced by Mr. Dayton for preventing any
jld money being applied to fortifications, the
ik- jurisdiction of which had not been ceded to
ra- the United States.
> n > Mr. Brookes recapitulated his objec
tions to this proposition.
h Mr. Gallatin said he had voted for this
,; 1# amendfrient, because he conceived it to be
h tr founded 011 just principles; and as he (hould
-ipt now vote against it, it was necessary to give
ei- his reasons for doing so. He believed the
principle just, and proper to be used when
ever the United States (hould go into a ge
-11 neral plan of fortifications ; but, as this was
'ilj. only meant for a temporary provision against
of danger, he believed it could not be abided
by; because the danger might be greatest,
and the afliftance wanted most, at a pjace
which was not ceded. Be fides, he believed
Pj"l there was not a single port in the United
States had ceded exclusive jurifdiftion of
of their territory, according to the conftitu
-11- tion, and therefore this provision would go
in- to preclude the whole from relief; as every
ceflion which Jiad been made; p nvidcd Far a -
concurrent jurilili&ion of tlie it&c. So far ref<
as it related to PenflfyWwra,'ftÂ«-Would not in <
"be entitled to any support, Iwcaiife (he not up<
only reserved a concurrent jurifdiffcion, but t-.ie
provided that if the cefiion was not accepted doi
within one year, it would be void, and more wo
than one year had no elapsed, and the cef- an<
lion was not accepted. ' S el
The que ft ion wa* put, end tile amend
ment negatived, there being only 30 for it- th;
The next amendment was that limTting thÂ«
the interest of the money to be borrowed at Sii
6 per cent.
Mr. W. Smith hoped they (hould not
agree to this, but that they (hould agree to an
expunge what related to a loan. Other ex- th
penfes would be incurred, and he thought it Y<
would be better to include the whole in one foi
bill. ' ' - cri
Mr. Gallatik believed there would be' th
no ocCasion for a fpecific bill for a loan, a3
he believed the President had already fuffici-.
ent power to borrow money, if it could be 1Â°
got (alluding to the 5 millions 6 per cent all
stock agreed to last feflion). He thought
the present revenue would be fufficient, and tie
that it was only neceflary to give a pawer of
borrowing on anticipation. **
Mr. SwaNwick was in favor of continu- tJ
ing the amendment, because the striking of
it out, wonld appear as if they meant not di
to limit the interest; to 6 percent. He con- 21
demned the praftice of borrowing oney 31
upon all occasions. Whilst they were me
ditating schemes of. defence, he thought a
they ought also to fix upon some mode of railing
additional funds. He apprehended no good tl
to the United State 3 from this fyftcm of bor- "J
rowing. > c
Mr. Harper denied that the present re- P
venue could be relied upon to meet the ex
; penfes contemplated by this bill, especially *
. if they took into consideration an authorised
\ expence of 100,000 dollars, respecting the a
, trade with the Indians. He therefore tho't
- it neceflary to provide for them by a loan ; n
5 for taxes could not be laid and collected in
; time- to answer the exigency. In order to â Â«
: reimburse the loan, it would be neceflary of ?
I course to provide taxes.
Mn Swanwick was sorry to hear the F
t gentleman last up advocating permanent â¢ 1
- loansâ[Mr. Harper said he did not mean 1 r
" > permanent loans, but such as might be re- j c
' deemable in a few years.] Mi*. S. said, e
f this would nevertheless be an increase of *
} stock, and of course of debt. An irredeem- *
- able debt would indeed be*a very extraordi- 1
d nary thing for this country. He understood I
u his colleague to mean that whatever sum was I
" borrowed, (hould be in anticipation of the
revenue to be raised, which would answer 1
r I t"he idea of the gentleman from South-Cara- c
e lina himfelf. By the method proposed of J
) ; felling stock to pay borrowed money, whilst
! it appeared we were only paying 6 per cent.
'* | we were in faft paying 9or 10, because the ,
j stock was fold greatly below par. He hoped
j" I therefore they (hould provide by taxes for all 1
[' ] the money they expended.
Mr. W. Smith accused the gentleman
i- last up with wandering from the fubjeft.â
s > j The question was whether it was necefTary
5 " to fay any thing about a loan in this bill. .
re Tlfere were two kinds of loan, one in anti
cipation of existing revenue, another where
there was no revenue to meet the expense.
ut The present bill contemplated the former.
It was neceflary to give tW President pow- j
er to borrow, because if there was no surplus
"Â» of revenue, the expense could not be met.
"He did not objeft to the amendment because
it limitted the interest of money, but'becaufe
if the interest was agreed to, the appropria
it- tion clause could not afterwards bi struck
er out. Before they fofe, he trusted prcvifion
would be made for the payment of whatever
"f might be borrowed, in four or five years.
He had no expeftation of money being bor
jy rowed in any other way than in anticipation
ut of the revenue.
t ; Mr. N. Smith objefted to the interest
d, of the money to be borrowed being limitted
â¬t ' to 6 per cent, as he believed it crould not be
borrowed at that rate, and it would be a
*. r . mere farce to limit intereft at a price be
es, low that at which it could be got. If money
its was absolutely neceflary, it must be got up
>es on the best terms upon which it could be
:v " had. The President might certainly be
b . c . trusted in tf-bufinefs of this fort, since no
a one could believe he would pay more in
rej tereft than there was a necessity for paying.
:hc Mr. GallatiS was not for confiding
ide wholly to the- President as to the Interest to
Â°* be paid for money. It was usual, he said,
:v " to limit the interest of all money to be bor
rowed. Mr. G. reminded the gentleman
from S. Carolina, of a saving in the last mi
litary appropriation of 150,000 dollars less
a- than the sum estimated, and contrary to tiat
of gentleman's wifiies, which would corifidera
ca- bly iucreafe the surplus of revenue.
Mr. N. Smith mentioned the loan of a"
fill million of dollars for the Algerine buiinefs,
tc- which was authorised to be borrowed, with
to out limitation of interest.
Mr. Co it was in favor of dispensing with
ro- the borrowing clause.
iny Mr. Hartley spoke in favor of thelimi
:he tation. He beh'eved money might be got
to at 6 per cent. He (hould be unwilling to
pay more, as it would increase the interest of
ec- money generally.
Mr. Brookes said the question was not
his whether more than fix per cent ftiolJld be
be paid for the interest of money, but whether
uld the borrowing clause (hould be inserted at
ive all.
the Mr. Otis was of the fame opinion. He
en- thought it would be best to have a diftinft
ge- bilLfor all the money wanted,
vas The question upon agreeing to the amend-'
!nft ment limiting" the interest of money, was
led negatived, there being 44 for it, and 50
eft, against it.
ace The next amendment was the clauie ap
fed propriating 40,000 dollars for the fortifica
ted tions of S. Carolina and Georgia,
of Mr. Gallatin hoped this would be dif
tu- agreed to, since the amendment limiting the
go general expenditure to such places as had
:ry ceded their jurifdidbon, had been negatived.
Mr. W. Smith moved that tlie hou(e \ '
refoiW itfilf into a committee of the' whole, 1 , . r
in order to take the sense of the committee Re Â£
upon striking out the 7;, 000 dollars for <
the purpose of adding this sum 01 40,000 faq,
-dollars to it, since fie fuppoled thia clause hie,
would be negatived, because S. Carolina*
and Georgia would now be included in the
general appropriation.
Several members having exprefled a wi(h IVi .
that this motion might be withdrawn until Qlt
the other amendments were gone thro' Mr. mai
Smith withdrew it.
The provision was then negatived. '' *
The amendment proposed by Mr. Allen J*
and amended by Mr. Havens, empowering ' .
the president to authorize the State of New par
York to ef-pend a certain sum upon their f ivc
fortificatious, which (hould be put to the Su
credit of the balance ,due from that State to '
the Un\.'d State?, then occurred. â¢ -
M*. Srookes opposed the
Mr. Cochran prefpofed to add the fol
lowing words, in orrÂ»jr to cover the expence 0 f
already incurred iu. the fortifications at New ha<
York, viz. " or which may have been expen
ded by any State for the purpose aforcfaid. "
Mr. Galtatin had no objection to the â¢
two millions which New York owed the .j-j
United States being expended upon their ln
fortifications; but this amendment went to
discharge the State of New York from the fee
200,000 dollars already expended, wether lc.
any more was expended, or not.
This amendment was negatived, without
a divilion.
Mr. Harper proposed to add, after gr
the State of New York, "under the dtreSion
of the President of the United States," as afe- gj
curity for the money being properly em- >n
, ployed. _ _ _ 'â 
After alittleconverfation, this motion was
â  was carried without a division.
[ The question was then on tl)e amendment
â  as amended,
Mr. Macon was for rejefting the amen-
. ment. ' . . C
J Mr. M'Dowel was of the fame opinion.
> He objected to the amendment on two rf
f grounds, he thought it wrong to call upon u
the Debtor State in this indirect way for the f
> payment of their balances, and he thought
[ it also Wrong to throw away so much mo-
, i ney on fortifications, which he said could be r
.|of no use, for though they might prevent an Â£
' enemy from landing at the particular point
f where they were fixed, they could not pre- t j
vent them from landing at some neighbour- n
ing spot, and being landed they would take .
j pofleflion of the fort, and turn the guns a-
s gainst ourselves. a
e Mr. Brookes opposed the pafling of
r the aniendment', and thpught.the only way j.
â of fettling the business of the debts, would v
f be Ey a conference with the state of New
\ York. c
Mr; FimDley insisted upon it th.it the balan- ,
" ces were fetrled, . and cquU not now be quef
j tiontd: - ,
" Mr. Baldwin gave his vote, in the commit- J
11 tee of the whoie, in favor "of "this, because he {
hÂ»d been informed it would be acceptable to the J
n state of New-York.' If he. thought fitch 4 pro- [
_ position would be difagrecable to them, he
would not have supported it. He believed,
7 when passion l'ubfirfed", this settlement between ]
f' the States and the United States, would be ac- 1
i- k'nowledged to be a perfeÂ£tly*.fair tranfaijlion 1
re With refpefl to the latter part of the imcid- 1
e. ment, requiring the jurildiition to be ceded, he
r _ Ihould be oppoled to it. lie did not wiih to in-
S fift upon an Â£xclufivi right. He was willing

farther thin was neceflary to keep peace.amoi)jjft i
fe them and with foreign nations. ' i
fe â¢ Mr. Vaknum said it would take upward; of"
a- twenty 'millions of dollars to extend this plan of .
â¢Jj. fortifications throughout the Cniied States, and â¢
there was no doubt when it was done in one
place, others wouid spply for the-bke attention.
er He was therefore opposed to, it.
-s - Mr. "Bayard did not why,they fliou'd
>r- tfifcrimifiate"betwixt, one place and another ;
an they ltruck out the clause refpefUrg South Ca
rolina and Georgia on this ground, and he trus
ted tjiey fiiould disagree to this. He objefled to
" , it also, becatife it teemed to admit the Hate ba-
lances', as jufily due. Mr. B. then went at con
"e fiderable length into the manner of the fettle
a ment of the commissioners, denied that the
>e- debts were justly due, and lioped there would
ey be a re-fÂ»tticment. Gentlemen favd they voied
p. for this to oblige the debtor Hates. It was an
y odd way of obliging them, by voting for a mea
, e sure which would dtftroy the existence of fame
of the states.
no Mr. Harter observed that the gentleman's
in- arguments would have been exaitly in point,
ig. had the fubjeft of the balances been under con
njr fideration.
Mr. Otis said he yesterday voted for the a
., mendinem ; he was led fo from the idea
1G ' that he Was conferring a favor on the state of
>r " New York? but having since with
an the reprefentatives.from that state, he had been
ni- aftonilhed to find, they .were generally against it.
ess He (hould therefore decline doing them a favor
lat in fpiteof themselves. He was abouyo follow
[_ a Mr. Bayard in his observations ; but the Spea
ker said he had impropeily fuffered that gentle
man to proceed, and couid not admit a farther
' a deviation from o-der.
Mr. S. Smith spoke in favor of the amend
th- ment, and hoped the gentiemau last up would
not throw away his vote 5 for though some
; t h states might not choose to accept, of the offer oth
ers would.
Mr. M'Dowell again spoke against themo
ni" tion. ,
'Ot the gentleman from

The amendrfient, as amended, was then pat

Mr. W. Smith then moved to strike out the
second feflion of the bill, in order to leave the
loan to a future law.
Mr. Gallatin \j ilhedtlie gejuleman to con
fine hirufelf to the loan, and not: to the appro

Mr. Smith consented, and the motion was a
greed to
Mr. W. Smith then moved that the house a
gain resolve itfelf into a committee of the whole,
iri order to add the 40,000 dollars proposed to
be appropriated for South Carolina and Geor
gia, to the 75,000 for the general appropriation.
He shewed at length the jÂ»if) ice of this meafi^e.
Mr. Rutledge seconded the motion,and
said he trailed the vote of the House would
, r be confident with that of the committee.â
The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.
Gallatin)* had moved, in the committee of
the whole House, for a reduction or the fun
' recommended by the feleft c.ommittee, le
\ cajife Carolina and Georgia were to be ex
cluded from a participation of the general
' appropriation, they not haying ceded to the.
United State? the jurifdittion of the territo
" ry where fortifications had been and were to
' be erected, and because special provision was
1 to be made for fortifying those states. But
" the House having determined not to discrimi
nate between the states which had ceded-the
" jurifdi&ion of their territory and those which
had not,, and the clause in the bill which
, appropriated 40,000 dollars for fortifying
J Carolina and. Georgia being expunged, he
l hoped the gentleman from Pennsylvania
would not be so uncandid as to oppose the
' ,int'Oduftion of the sum which had been re
commended by the committee. The reafoif
[- he had afligned for reducing it being that a
special provifioil would be made for fortifj
. Ing '.he southern .states, and the clause- which ,
e provided for {heir; defence being ekilroyed,
e Mr. R. hoped the gentleman would not lie
so inconsistent as to limit the appropriation
j e to 75,000 dollars, but would now vote -&r
n ' 115,000, and thus, by adding the sum vot<d
in the committee for fortifying the southern
1 states to the general appropriation, accord
1- with the -vote of the committee of the while
* House. ". .
l " Mr. R. exprefled his surprise, that after .
.j' the lengthy debate which took, place in the
y committee, in which he had detailed the de
ft fenpelefs state of Carolina and GÂ«jrgia,. ttjro
gentlemen Ihould now'alk if 75,1500 dollars
3 f" wquld not be a fufficient sum for all the pur-
pofes of defence and fortifications. He. re
quested they would call to memory, the ob
servations which had beefi made yesterday
by a gentleman from Maryland (general'."
!d Smith) whose miliary * talents were ..well
; known. by .every member in the House, arid
a " to whose military services this country was
greatly indebted. He had ftated.xhafc
n . ing our harbours. What the gentleman
e . from North-Carolina had observed
hc ing fortifications was true as it related" tfo io
ld ternal defence âbut for the. defence of the
coast he knows they \yere of iijfinitc-fervice.
He (general M'Dow'ell) had been too ac
ng lively.engaged in cur revolutionary war not
to know that fortifications had answered
i's many valuable purposes. He knows that
it, the southern states were preserved for several
years by a fortrefs in Carolinaâhe knows
that fir Peter Parker with a large fleet, and
fir*H, Clinton with a formidable army, were,
Q f in 1776, baffled at fort Moultrie, in their
t h attempt to pass it, and compelled, after hav
en ing attacked it most vigoroufiy for twelve
it. hours, to abandon their project of con*
or quering the southern states. True it is that
>w fort Moultrie was afterwards taken, and the
whole state overrun by the enemyâbut the
lrr conquest was made by an irrefiftable force,
after a very long and gallant defence,
id- Mr. R. thought 30 or 40,000 dollars, ex
'ld pended judiciously, would put Charleston in
a complete state of defence. He admitted
that veflels might pass a fort without re
-10. ceiving rr.ucfi injuryâbut contended, that
whenever 'twas ppfiible to have a crofs-frc
mi on them, few commanders would be so
3o- venturous as to carry Ihips into fnch a peril
,oU3 situation. He described the harbour of
l ' a6 Charleston as being very capable of complete
defence by fortifications. He said the fe
fe. cretary at war contemplated fortifying aa
lc j island opposite to fort Johnson, and when
Illy that shall be done, veflek attempting to pass
op- it will encounter a ctpfs fire. Mr. R. dwelt
much on the nccefliiy of fortifying the coast
of the southern statesâdescribed it as being
very extensive, and having near it much
ia y wealth, and that of a very perishable nature.
hut In all events, he said, even in th-.t of our
an- being certain a general peace will immediate
ly take place, fortifications would be neccf
?Â°n fary in'the south. Let whatever ordfr of
a y*- things obtain ia Europeâthe revolution had
, been so complete in the Weft-Indiesâeverv
|r j >) thing which was venerable and refpe&able
r3r> had been so entirely subvertedâanarchy ar.d
E- | disorder were so prevalent and extensive there
iiif- fÂ«r years to Cflme wc mull erpeft tahave our commerces in that fn vsiu-J by '
buccaniers and our coa-t infefted by pirates. 11
He concluded with thmki.ig th; houfj |j
for the attention with which it hit honored f t
his obfervatioiisâHe deemed it quite unne
cessary to add to them *3 it would be doipg rt
great injustice to the consistency and can-
dour which diltinguiihed thsÂ»proceedings of
the Houseâto fupp >fe itAvonW on this day â
give a vote in dirett contradiftion to tljat o
of yefterdiy. He was p .rfuaded they would k
not, and that a large majority would rife in "
favor of appropriating 115,000.d011ar3.
Mr. Giles had no doubt of the fitua
ation of Charlcfton being as represented ; 1'
but thought the 75,000 dollars, and the n
20,000 in hand, would be equal to all that
would be wanted before Congress met again.
Mr. Gallatin was of the fame opinion.
He did not think that one half of the 115,
000 flollars would be spent, as only 140,
000 had been expended from 1794 to 1797. f
He tho't no more ihould be appropriated
than was abfillutcly necessary: for if they
took into consideration the situation of Eu
rope at present, there was every reason to y
expe& a general peace would take place. d
He thought the probability so great as al- Â£
moil to do away all apprehenlion? of danger
to this country. But, because they were tl
met together, Gentlemen seemed disposed to Â»
dofomething. He was willing that some- d
thing fiiould be done. He was therefore in
favour of those measures which could do the t
lealt harm* He ihould vote for the bijl in a
its present shape; but he (Wild be against
raifmg the additional troops proposed, as
they would cost 400,000 dollars a year,
which would be guarding against an imagin
ary' danger, by introdudbon a real evil.
He fliould be again ft recommittingthisbillbe- 1
cause if they vent farther they (hould enter
upon that plan which had been produced
by a sense of danger which he did not think
row exilted. " That danger had lessened be
twixt the time of calling Congress and their c
meeting, but which had lessened J
unce. i
Mr. Allen thought it was insanity to 1
assert there was 110 danger to be apprehended
from our present situation as to foreign na- 1
tions. The diffatisfa&ion expressed by the j
Spa nidi Government, he called a scandalous '
njiferable pretext. He considered this na
tion as on the eve of war; spoke of the 1
"French furt onnding us on all fides, nay, 1
he said something about declaring war if the
polls which they held were not given up.
He hoped they ihould take vigorous mea
sures of defence, and r.ot feperate until they
laid a direct tax. Whatever the benevolent
mind of the gentleman last up might think
of me Frervch nation, he could look upon
them as nothinglefs than foes. (The Speak
er reminded the gentlemen of the question.) â 
He concluded with great warmth in charges
of ambition against the French nation.
Mr." Milledge and Mr. Shepard each
spoke in favour of going ifttp a committee
of the "whole.
The queftiou for re-committing was carri
ed 46 to 43. The house accordingly went
into a Committee of the whole, and agreed
to mak'e thefum 115,000, infteadof7s,ooo,

they have a right to expeÂ£t : And by the

they have always done, with iftrift attach

the following favorable events. âviz.âHis
ty has offered to support the rights of the in
habitants to the real property, and until that
is ascertained, I am bound to keep poffeflion

L is the enjoyment of the liberty of conscience
is hereby positively explained to be, that

WHEREAS the alarming cjrcumftances j
that prevailed for a while in this Govern

approbation, and applaud that upright sense s
of duty that the inhabitants have (hewn to t
the laws of our gracious Sovereign, by fe- 1
condlDg his representative, the right they {
have fojuftly acquired of being considered a
the most loyal fubje&s of his Majesty. In J
my last publication I mentioned that until 1
the real property Ihould be secured to the f
inhabitants, this country should be consider- 1
ed in the same-situation as before, as like- (
wife while the pacific disposition of the In- t

ty to explain that a negociation is now car
rying on to secure the right of the said real 1

red but by an additional article to the late <
treaty,and untilthat article is officially com- <
municated to me, I am bound to keep pol-' 1
fefiion of the country, and continue the fame t

is impossible for his Majesty to leave unpro- 1
te&ed so many of his faithful fubjefts, and 1
expose other settlements to the revengeful ]

important objefts are oÂ£ the greatest moment i
to every person in this government; their in- -1

them to keep steady in their principles of 'â¢

Natchez j March 31ft, .'97.
MY DEAR SIR, . 1
I WAS last evening addrefTed by a num
ber of refpeftable inhabitants of the Diftrift j ;
of Natchez. . They are very much alarmed
for their situation, in consequence of having ;
exprefied their pieafure, fmce my arrival at
this place, in speedily becoming.citizens of
the- United States'. Your proclamation of
the~zÃth inft. they conceive renders that e
vent doubtful. They' have therefor? from
confederations.'of personal fafety, and to a
void -the insults \yhich many of them have
esperitneed ' from one or more officers of
a small grade in this (3iilriÂ£t, have called u
pon me to use my influence with your Ex.-
qellency to. grant them, and all others who
incline to leave J this country, the privilege of
difpofingof their properties and passports to
enable them to reach the frontiers of such
dates as they may be inclined to remove to.
I have'now ft?ted the fubftartce of their ap
plication, and aflure your Excellency, from
the refpedlability of the applicants, it is a
fubjeft in which I feel myfelf intcrefted,
and to which I requed your at
tention.
Ever fincel arrived in this diftridt, I have
uniformly recommended to the inhabitants
a'quiet submission to the Government now in
force ; at the fame time they have been in
the most explicit manner assured, that the
period would not be far distant when theju
rifdiftion of the United States, would be
extended to them. But they are not Satis
fied ; they have their suspicions ; and it is
your Excellency alone that can quiet them.
Let the cannon and military (lores be again
taken out of the fort; withdraw your ob
jeftions tothe arrivalof the American troops,
; and their apprehensions will subside. Ido
â  not pretend to fay that their apprehensions
: are well founded ;it is poflible they are not.
1 but your objedtion to my escort's being fta

e MANY whose ideasofallegiancehad been
1, preponderant from the treaty until the time
ir of your arrival at this place, thought them
- selves at full liberty to announce their senti
ments ir. any way that might not afffft the
h operations of peace and good order in soci
ety. But the result is a melancholy contrast
to the conftniÂ£Hon. Sons have been
dy torn away from the hofcm ofagricultural
life, and conveyed to prison with every in
dignant epithet that malevolence could in
vent. Scouts are eroding the country In
various dire&ions, breathing threats of venn
geance sgainft those Y/lio had unguardedly
thrown aside the mask of duplicity ; and a '
number are waiting with solicitude the mo
ment of their fate.
There are many in this country to whose
exertions America is much indebted for her
political existence. We call upon you in J
the name of such ; we call upoff you in the ,
name of every friend to that emblem of peace V
and science which has been recently display- c
ed to us : to stand forth with a coif dfnee, 0
suitable to the dignky of your commiflion, Â£
and demand of the Governor, paflports with f
leave for all such as would dispose of their f
property and avail themselves of a change of i
situation b'f withdrawing to the United i â¢

From his Excellency Manuel Gayofo de Le- h

MY DEAR SIR, Â£
I 1 iAVE just now received your favor 0
of this day, in which yoir informed of the j
application dT several respectable inhabi- 0
tants of this Government to you, request- '
ing your interpolation to facilitate to them a '
privilege that they never ceased enjoying, t
and in which confills the great liberty of a a
Spaniard. There is not one single in fiance a
in our government of having made oppofi
fition to a person's felling his property, and [
leaving the criuntry, whenever they called t
for a passport ; and as our fyflem is not al- a
tered, I (hall not refufe the sam? privilege to I
any person that may apply for it.
I am sorry to find, that those persons !
who have addrefled you, have imposed upon (
your credulity and goodness, in making nie ,
of remonstrances proper to make sensation â  ]
on the feelings of a good "citizen of the 1 '
United Statesâbut there is not a word of 1 Â®
truth in what they have advanced. I hr.ve t
not taken notice of the farisfaftion that r
some persons have exprefied on the profpedt t
( of becoming citizens of the United States ; 1
nor has any body been apprehended for itâ j
nor have I iflued any order for such a pur- ,
pose, but against Mr. Green, fen. who had (
made his escape, conscious of the criminal- <
ity of his conduct, which is notorious ; and '
iudeed in all the extent of this government, j
there is'but one single individual confined,
and that is for a criminal proceeding. There
is not a single patrol out in search of any
one, nor just in this moment do I find occa
sion for it; but if I should, I would em- ,
ploy every means in my power to suppress
disorder, and to keep the peace of the coun
try, as I have always done.
I doubt not of the afiurances you please
to give me of the good advice you have uni
formly given to the peopleâit being con- :
formable to the character of a gentleman,
whose objeft is another than that of inter
fering in the matters of government.
My Proclamation I found absolutely ne
cefiary to calm the minds of the peopleâ
: stating to them the true situation of the po
litical arrangements between his Majesty
and the United States, which does not dis
solve the treaty, but requires an eflential ex
planation, not only with regard to the
points alluded to in my Proclamation,
but likewise as I am authorized to
declartf to you, that the General of this
Province finds himfelf under the necessity
to consult his Majesty concerning the man
ner in which the posts are to be evacuated ;
as it appears by General Wayne's commu
nication to him, that he expsfts that the
posts will be delivered with the buildings
standing as they are ; and by the treaty, We
conceive that the posts are to bedemolifhed
before we leave them ; arid as such interpre
tation of the true meaning of the treaty ei
ther one way or the other [it] might pro
duce unneceljary ministerial contcfts, my
General has given me positive orders to ful
pend the evacuation of the posts until the
matter (hall be amicably fettled between the
two Courts. In the mean while, if the
troops of the United States that are daily
expe&ed, arrive, they (hall be received at
Nogales in the most friendly and hospitable
manner, as is due to a nation with whom we
are at perfett peace, and with whom we wish
to keep the most perfeit harmony.
I flatter myfelf you will do me thejuftice
so acknowledge the propriety of my conduft
in obeying the superior orders of my Gene
ral, who is aftuated by the principles of the
ftri&eft honor in supporting the iatereft of
his Majesty intruded to him.
The uniform good harmony that we have
reciprocally promised to each other will sub
sist ; and it will not be only our duty but
our glory to bani(h every (hadow of misun
derstanding, which is wrongly interpreted
by the public, without any more foundation
than aflifted those that tried to persuade
you of wrongs that they never fuffered.
I am, with sentiments of the most sincere
esteem, and true friendfhip, &c.
Manuel Gayoso de Lemos.

our surprize atÂ» this uucxpe&ed intelligence, the

Gentlemen,
ALTHOUGH I do by.EO means admit the rca~
in your letter of I jth inft. addrefied to Rear
Amiral Nelson, that the blockade of an enemyV
port, is unusual, much !efs unprecedented ; having
ir. two instances carried a firaiiar measure into exe- >
cution during- the lafl year, in the Mediterranean,
via. Toulon and Leghornâl have great f&tisfac
tiÂ»n in relieving the minds of the merchants of
neutral powers resident at Cadiz, by giving you
the most unequivocal afTuranccs, that the (hips and
of neutral nations, loaded with bonafdc pro
perty of neutral merchants, carrying clear and au
thentic documents in proof thereof, will (-open
presenting them to the commanding officer of the
fquadren of his Britannic Majefty'slhips under my
command) be permitted to proceed from Cadiz to
their refpedlivo detonations, after such examination
as the said officer shall in his discretion judge nectf
fary to make.
