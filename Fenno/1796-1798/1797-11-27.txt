on shore. I made a signal for my two small
Â»c:Ws to keep in the wake of the Naiade,

the harbour. /
After having very diftinftly counted all
the drips*(as per en'clofed lift) we hauled
c.ir wind. The forts fired at us without
eITV-rt, \'?Â«nigh vn- veve so close in that we
'civ d .L : (t:Â«ipui(h the particular place in the
Fort, v H re the Ba/Baiu resides, as Mr.

{nor- ; Aanding in towards .the town, we
saw several ships gÂ»tting under way and
making fail out of the harbour : it tailing
calm, they l"o6fl can.e to anchor. Towards
noan, we got a frefh easterly breeze,
which we could stand in towards the land, or
t>r off again at plaafure. I made a signal
for my in 1 all vessels not to attend to my ma
-nctuvres, and,immediately flood in fdr the
enemy, partly with a view to reconnoitre,
and also witji the hope of finding an oppor
tunity to give them a broadside. But after
. I'had Â«oFinto nine and a half fathoms of
wn'er, my pilot refufed to carry me further.
After taking 3 full survey ofthp ships, I
ft od o!T towards the brig' and Zebeck, with
a press of fail ; and finding on board the
] : :.r a clever fellow, who â¢ undertook to
pilot me'inâknowing also the qualities of

of the harbor. Here I r-ceived thefireof the
f.x flips which was really heavier than I had
reason to exptft . I tacked when I had got
abrcoft 1)t them, gave them my broadside,
and flood out again, making at the fame
time the befl use of my stem chafe*. Wc
oh served an immense crowd of people on
board cF all the velMs, I had n6 foontr
got clear of the breakers, than I observed
the whole fqaadron get Hp their anchors and
follow me. I laid to and waited for them
with tranquillity. They very soon got out
ail Cx, and immediately attacked me with
great isr.pettioftty. In the mean time my
two small veff<ls had bore down to me,
which cmharraiTed me very much, particu
larly the Zebeck, and hid well nigh been the
eÂ»uf-. ofgrcpt chagrin-to me ; but, jn their
place I faould certainly have done th# fane.
The a A ion commented at half an hour
pafl five o'clock, P. M. and continued with !
great fur)' till half pail feve'.f, when, of a i
sudden, th*y all bore down upon, me, with j
horrid fcreeclifs. I filled my fails to shoot !
aheâ .id, and immediately backed again, in on- j
dcr to keep c'ofe to the enemy. While thus
engaged, I saw a liip wii+i a flag from her
forstopmafthead, and which failed remarka-
Uv well, give chafe to the brig and Zebeck
to leeward of me. Tii.s obliged me to bear,
away in order to thruw myft'f between the
ship and the brig. Whether owing to the 1
fire from the brig's two fix-pound stern-cha
ses, (which I have reason to believe) or my
corning up with the frigate, the enemy gave
up the pursuit, and hauled his wind ; but
instead of making fail, he backed his main
topfail. We pasTed so close under his stern, (
as tothrow some 3Tb grenades from the tops â 
iuto him, giving him at the fame time our
whole broadside, and we could hear its tak
ing proper efFeÂ£l 011 him. By this time it
had grow* so dark that wc could no longer <
ohferve his manoeuvres. His stem was ve
ry much fluttered ;â¢ âhis mizen yard came ]
defwn, and the brig had shot away his jib
boom previous to pur coming tip. The o- <
ther tefTels we had just before engaged, had
already hauled their wind and flood in for
the shore. 'The darkness of the night ren- (
dered it prudent for me to remain with my
small vessels and protest them. Had I been
alone, I (hoidd have been better pleased, be- â  j
cause I fhotdd certainly have done more.

however, I may cfteem myfelf fortunate in /
notlofing more men, because when we pas

she suspended the fire of her great guns, in

so tremendous that it is difficult to form an /}
idea of it N a severe !lor:u of hail is the on
ly thing I can campare it to.' The Naiace's it

_j Since my letter giving yoy an account of
t the engagement of the 16th ult. affairs havÂ«
very much changed. On the 17th I pre-
fented myfelf before Tripoli's having sent
e the brig and Zebeek to Malta. I faw l all
the ships ivhich w* had engaged hauled close
_ in under the guns of the Fort, and hard at
work to repair their damages. I repeated
, this visit everyday until the 22d, when a, ,
fioat came dut to me, carrying English co
lours. It proved to be the English consul,
who had been prevailed on fcy the Bnfhaw
4 to come on hoard the Naiade, to know if I
would enter into a negotiation for peace.â
I fetit an officer on Store immedi<tely, accom
panied by Mr. Luknbr, our consul, to hear
his proposals. The preliminaries were a
' K ree d upon a few days afterwards, and os
the 26th, I came to anchor at Tripoli's, and
j- was immediately saluted with at guns.
The following day, I had a public audi
j ence of the Bashaw, who treated me with j
the greatest diilindion, and delivered me 21
' of our countrvmen, who had been made I
prtfoners and flares on the breaking out of
* hostilities. They had been on board the
Tripolitan ships in the action ; butnoaeof
" them got hurt.
On the Jlft, I had my audience of leave,
when the Baihaw prrfenUd me with a fahre
richly set with gold, accompanied by fomc
very flattering compliment.
I had the fatisfaftion to find that the Da
nish nation is held in the high eft refpett bv
the Tripolitans. Their fhipatiad been hand- j
led very rouglily in the engagement with J
us : a Pohicre of 2$ gi:r,s (whieh fcught to 1
desperation) had 8 shot between wind and
water, and loft 100 men killed. The firft '
admiral, a Renegsdoj'wha in the action did '
not ebonite. to lay along ffde t-he Naiade, but '
kept on our quarter, had been surprised at
the fire be received from us, having no idea '
of theconftru&ion of my fi'igare.* J
The grenades which we threw on board '
the Polacre, did great execution,mid the '
Tripolitans werefo unacquainted with them, â 
that some of their officers came afterwards c
on board te me, to know what kind of things J
, they vyere. 0

VENICE, September 3.
A detachment of 3000 French troops
were embarked here on the jtlwinft. and set
fail for Dalmatia where they are togarrifon
our ifjands, and the chief towns in the litor
al diftri&s, in order to preveut the further
progress ofthe Auftrians, who hsvi hitherto
only taken pofftffion of Zaara and its depen
dencies. The French Venetian fleet which
had failed for Corfu, in July last, appeared
011 Wednesday quite in fight of the city,and
difembsrked immediately several thousand
land troops, and a corps of Greek volun- ,
teers. The fleet has been reinforced at
Corfu with etjrbt French and four Venetian ,
(hips of the line and is now composed of .
20 fliips of the line, I 7 frigates and a num
ber of fin all armed â¢ vessels, making in all
from 50 to 60 fail, besides the 8 ships now
fitting and wbich are also ready fÂ»r fca. (
Repijrt fays that this fleet is destined to Co- ,
ver a descent upon the coast of Iftria and j
Croatia, in cafe the negociatians at (
ano should be broke off. It is indeed poffi- ,
ble that the fleet has been ordered to return j
from Corfu, and draw nearer to the'Auftfi- c
an coast, in order to intimidate thÂ«. Emper- a
or, and hasten the concluflon of a defiim c
live peace, by the difplay.of such a forrrii- l
dable naval force. â  But this fleet has cer- r
tainly not been fitted out, to make an attack
upon the Austrian coast, because our nu
mttous gallics and bombfhips might in oafe
of seceflity be employed with more advan- y
tage in the shallow bays along the coast of t
Croatia. It is probable that the fleet after t
having taken on board the naval fta- I
tues &c. stipulated for in our treaty with f
France, will return to the Mediterranean in t
comriany with the ships now fitting here.
C jt municipality has charged our minis- t
ter sjt Conjlantinople t'o communicate to the \ v
Ottoman Porte the solemn.protestations of j f ;
the Venetian Republic again ft the invr.fion ! v
of Iftria and a part of Venetian ls.almatia, j a
by tbc Auftrians. The Tnrkifh afr.baffador ' tl
at Paris has already delivered a note* to the .
Executive Directory wherein he declares
" that it was far from him to believe, that Â£
the General in chief Buonaparte had either
tacitly or expressly consented to the seizure
of Venetian Iftria and Daimatia by the Auf
trians, he was on the contrary convinced that
the worthy General had felt great difplea- j
i fare at the proceeding# becjnjfe it was Mtuil

' PARIS, Sept. 18. 1797.
h Before general Moreau left Strafburg, he
ordered several persons to be arretted whom
he knew to. keÂ£p a correspondence with the
emigrants. All the members of the adminis
tration, but one, were displaced, and ao
" r body r/as fuffered to pass off the bridge of
Kehl, to or from the right bank of Rhine.
' Eighty deputies were arrested in the depart
-1 meat of the Lower Rhine, and a much
\ greater number took flight and hasten.-d to
! the otjier fide of the River, as soon as the
reports of the defeat of the conspirators at
' Paris were whispered about. The 'General
of division Moulins, who commands at
i Strasbourg, has taken the most energetic
' Â»measures to purge the country from royal-
I ifts.
Nobody queflions the republicanism. of
General Moreau, but his long silence on
the fubjedl of the difcorery of a correfpon
j dence between Cor.de and Pichegru is fe-
I verely ccnfnr ed. The correspondence found
] in the Emigrant KJenghin's trunk, was in
bis hands since April last, and he with-held
, its contents from the government until
September, and even then he communicated
the Â£ecret only in confidence to one of his
acquaintances in the person of the dire&or
Barthlemy, to whom hifl letter dated Straf
r bourg, Sept. 3 was dire&:d. How differ
ent was the conduct of the general in chief
of the army of Italy ! The ci-devant Count
d'AntraigMes was about the middle of May
arrested at Ti-ielte, bv general Bernadotte,
who sent him immediately with his papers
to Buonaparte's head quarters at Montbel
lo. A copy ofd'Antraigues convjrfation
with Montgailiard certified at Monttbello
on the 24th May, by Berthier, was besides
other interefung pieces fafely delivered :o ,
the three faithful dire&ors at the beginiiing
of June. Buonaparte was a friend of Car- I
out, yet he abandoned him as soon as he dis
covered his connections with the enemies of
his count! he facrificed his personal feel
ings to the interest ofthe Republic and com
municated the secrets of the conspirators,
only, to those three executive officers, whom
he found worthy the confidence of a Re
publican.
The family nf Lajollajs mentioned in Mo
rcau'3 letter ashating facilitated Pichegru's
correspondence with tha agents of Louip
XVIII, at Paris, has been found out here,
and is now in prison. The ex-cbief of bri
gade Bcdouille, whom Pichegru frequently
sent to Conde's head-quarters, has been ar
rested with a number of other royal agents
at Befancon.
Sept. 21.
General Reynier, chief ofthe etat-major
of the army of Rhine and Moselle, arrived
ycfterday, with the remaining part of the
letters and memorials found among the emi- ,
grant Klenghin's baggage. Every thing
: was quiet at Strasbourg when he left that" 1
place, the republican army in the high- ,
eft spirits, and no movement had takenplace 1
among the Auftfian troops; their three j
camps are at the distance of from 20 to 30 j
leagues from the advanced polls in the Brif- i
gaw. 1
Sept. 22,
Yesterday another transport of royalists '
was sent off under a strong escort. Trans
portation is unqueftionahly the best method
to punish the apostles Â»f royalty and force
them in a manner to become ufeful to the i
Rtpublic. The revenues of their estates are t
sent them to the place of their exile, and c
theirproperty in Francecan beconfifcated on- t
Iy iu cafe ofdefertion from theplace to which
they are relegated. The latter clause is c
well calculated to secure th?tn in their new J

giving an account of th/alVufe of power j
committed as ycu fay by tiie M;|ita-y Au- ii
thorities, you have not scrupled to advance I
the following affertibris :
" TKe General of the army of the Sam- t
bte and Meufe has laid a contribution of d
3,725,000 livres, of wh'icn 219,400 only c
wert paid into the coffers of tin Payrr,alter f

peared in the hands of the ctat-major. The a
reft has bt;en paid into tha hands of a private c
agent, upon whom the general has given >
drafts to divers contractors."
I am that general whom you have dared, t
to represent in th' National Tribune not on- <
ly as a than who has aCted againftthe law, c
but also as a cheat who has defrauded his ]
brother soldiers of the pay that is due to t
them, As such I ought tb be punished. <
Before you published my name, you (
have done, was it not your duty to examine
the fafts ? Before you traduced an entire t
etat-major whejhave fought for the Repub- (
lie which yo\i are beginning to serve, was
it not your duty to inquire into the charac- ]
ters of my officers and myfelf ? Have you .
been deceived, or are you a deceiver ? Are s
you an ageitf of the faction that piirfue* e- ,
very man who has behaved honorably at the <
head of the armies, or are you only the dupe
of certain villains ?
These questions you will undoubtedly
answer. In the mean time here 4 are the
fafts : -
When I arrived at the army, the pay ot
the troops was several months In arrear.
An infinite'number of expencea were to be
provided for,-without which it was impot
fible to open the campaign. I provided for
them with the funds i f which I was then
depository, and I organized the conquered,
country on the left bank ?f the Rhine in
such a mariner as to enable us to draw from
â¢ thence our fubfiltence, and a part of our
pay. â¢ f
. After signing the preliminaries of peace,
the vifiorioa*-army wÃs on the banks of
the Nidda and the Mein, in an indifferent
eouHtry, already impoverished by the armies
of th- Belligerent powers, who had occu
pied it for of fix year.. By an
arre'.e of the XOth Floreal, I laid a contri
bution of 3,725,000 livres. But upon the
representation of the inhabitants, who were
obliged to feed the army, and repair a part
of the claathing and equipage of the soldiers
whom the adminilt ration fuffered to go na
ked, yes, Sir, absolutely naked, I remitted
them a fifth part: therefore the sum of
2,980,000 livres remained tp be levied.
I have few papers with me. I have ne
ver been able to get from the pay matter an
enaft account of what he had received.-
However, I can prove, that down to the
30th Thermidor, there has been paid into
the chest, â¢ ,

harrafled and ruined, have betaken them

The effluvia fays Dr- Zimmerman from a lit- cc

" true we fee thonfands of cases of remittents, and ,]

tenre of contagion in them sometimes, than t |
the freedom from disease after visiting a person

been propagated in the fame The truth ,
" upon this lubjffl is, that it merely requires a ( j

to make theleifevers contagious or not. This\

lieving that the disease never baj originated in Phila
delphia, nor ever can be occasioned by putrid vege
table effluvia ; but is always importtd by rtf
fels with sick persons or infected goods on board \
He adds 'hat " the difeafs was generated in Â«
nny ether paries the United States-os but at
had always been introduced, when it did occur, by 01
â¼effels from the Weft Indies, though the seasons fe
had frequently been an hot and dry, and some ta
more so, and the (ireets more replete with putrid p'
vegetable matter than in 1793. Araonj otuher in-
Hancrs of itsliaving-heen imported headduced those
mentioned by Dr .' Lining in Charleston, in proof;
and yet wefindthatheformerly believed Lining was
mistaken is to' the real source of these fevers ;
witness the following extract from " The account
a/ the difcafcs of tbr United States," above men- /
tionod, p. 389 : " Dr. Lining fays, that the yel
low-lever has been four times epidemical in
Charleston, viz. in the autumn of 1731, 39, 45Â» (
48 ; anil ax none of these were remarkable for
extraordinary heat orniny weather,
that it did not taieits origin from any peculiari- I
ty of thd chtnate or foil, but was imported from it
thÂ« Weft-Indies ; and even afierts, that whene
ver the disease ippeartftJ,it was easily traced to
some person who had, litely arrived from the c
Weft-India illands, where it was epidemical." I'
IV't from a comyirifon of the description which
fie (fives ef the symptoms of this fever, with
that '/ Chalmers, and partieularly
from the more recent obrervations of Dr. Hun- "
ter in the Weft-Indies, I am inclined t J think
Dr. Lining has fallen into a very great er- 1
ror natir: andrab/eof thit disease. J
The eelAaated Lind, of Haflar hospital, appears c
to have fitlleu into a similar error, owing to the
mifreprefcntition of fa<sts hy L)r. Wafren, and
others. He has also recordeil an aerount of the
vellow-fever betoming epide-nie in Phil idcipbia,
In theve.ir 1740, Â«Â» ing to some infeiSed appa
rel of a.gentleman who had died of it in Harba
does. These clothes, he fays, being unluckily
hung abroad to be airrd, presently diffufed the
contagion of the fainc ftver over that pait of '
the town, and deftroved 100 persons. [ Ibis
was another of the proofs lately adduced by Dr. '
C. in his letter to Mr. Wynkoop, of the disease j
being always imported.] "It is however at (
present geaera'.ly known.{ for it has been proved j
by the, mofl accurate and usexceptionable ob- t
i'crvations,) that no infeclious disease can he
commumctted without contail, or the near ap
proach to the body of ininfeiied person ; or to
rhe somites orftibftances imbued with infeiftious
matter or morbific miafinata."
Thus we find, in 1789, Dr. C. entertainsd
fentimentt which he now fayj,cannot be espous
ed by any " quajifed to discern the connexion be
tzvten cauft and effect and the faÂ£t is, that
â  the former were right, and the'latter wrong.
la confluence of the astonishing improvements
â¢ ;hat have been made ir. medicine, in the eourfe
' f the last twenty years, it is no uncommon
I thing for medical gentlemen to renounce falfe
' theories, (except by some who suppose a dimi
- nuticn of dignity is effÂ«aed by acknowledging
1 the pofiil>illty of their having been 'ever wrong)
