Mill, with pair of (tones.; also a good Forge, all

were lately built for the purpose of calling Cannon
for this State. âThere are about two thousand acres
of half of which i s under wood, the other ,
verv fine arable Land, producing the best Hay and
Pallure. The Cannon lately mannfadured there,
fully proves the excellency of the metal, which is

to any in the world ; for not oue of sixty-nine gans
lately made, although some of the 84 were bored
into qz pounders, have failed on proving. The situ- .

Ptbalf on the additional Naval Armament- ]
(ConelwUd from fefietdaj i Gazette.)
The question on the sum of money to be
sppropriated coming underconlideration, (
Mr. S. Smith moved to strike out 950,00 a
dollars, and to insert in its place 1,200,000.â *
This motion was not feconaed, and the inoti
Â«n for gjO.ooo was then put and carried. j
The amendment for striking out sixteen vef
'fcls, and inferring twelve, being under view, |
Mr. Setgrraves called for the yeas and
nays on this question, which were agreed tÂ®
be taken.
Mr. Livincstox said he (hould be in fa
vour of the lafgeft nupiber of veflelsâfor
though he was decidedly agsinft the employ
ment of this armament' as convoys, because
he believed such an employment of them
would have ap unavoidable tendency not on|y
to involve this country in war with Franee,
but with England, and All the other bellige
rent powers, and becaule no inftruition* which
the President can give will prevent it. Since
this tfcas thÂ» Cafe, he believed twelve veflels
would be totally inadequate to such a state of
thing-. He had (aid it was the unavoidable
tendencyâfor what, he asked, was the object
of cenvoyst fiy they are to be
used to rcfift infringements upon the laws of
nations, or of treaties; and if this to be
the use of (hem, war must doubtless ensue j
for France ha* decreed that veflels (hall be
lawful prize in cases w'iicJi are contrary to the
laws or nations aivi of treaty; Great 3ritain
ha* done the Â£Â»vr>e ; and it must he flowed,
that if we shall have to engage all these pow
ers, twelve veflels will not be fufficient. On
th?contraty, Congress ought now, since this
decision had been come, to go into effe<Stual
roeafufes, if in war, for he confnlered the
country now in a state of war ; and let no
nan, laid he, flatter himfelf that the vote
wrtich has been given is not a declaration 6f
war. Gentlemen know that this is the cafe ;
and now they have concurred inphmging the
country in war, they ought to come forward
and provide the means for our' defence ; but
he did not wonder that tlic'y tremble and faj.il- I
ter, now thuy are at the lalt step to oe taken j
a step which tbey had been endeavouring frf
ascomplifh for many years pad; a war wit li
France, which they had so long wifiied, is
now 'accomplished ; at a period, too, when
v.e are Ukely to be left alone to sustain the
frock, when almost all the powers of Europe
have fallen under her force, or become ailies
in her schemes. We ought, he said, to con
cert mtanes of attack; for we (hould not have
to wage defenfive, but offenfive war also.
Now, said he, let us fee who is poflefled of
American feelings; let us fee whether thole,
.who call members cowards, and devoted to
*he service of another country, or those so
calumniated, poflefs the truest American feel
ing. As to these flanders theinfclves, lie
fliould always treat them as they merited ; he
eoiWdered himfelf'as dignified a character as
arty man who made the charge. [The Spea
ker called to order and Mr. L. fat down.]
Mr. Har r er was glad the gentleman from j
New-York would for'once in his life be con
fident and support the decifionsof a majority,
and that this flujb of his would not end in
fmoak. If the dignity of this Hou(e would
have permitted him to (ay so, he (hould have
said tire gentleman had made a very fillyfpeccb.
He Could not imagine what had giv*Â« rife to
it, except that to * gentleman .found himfelf
disappointed, in not havuigbeen able tocar
ry the amendment which had been negatived.
As to ths furficiency of this force, he did not
believe it was contemplated to fight France
â nd preat Britain, and for a good rcafon, be
eaufe it was not neceifary to fight them both.
If Great Britain lhall not only perfeverein her
present measures, but after infringing the
laws of nations and of treaties lhall follow it
up by decrees which will amount to agenerj
-onfiftation of our trade, and infeead of list
ening to our applications to get them altered,
stall drive otir Miniftcrs out of the country,
he fliould then be ready to go to-war with
vGreat Britain. At present, however, he saw
no catife of war agamft her, though he saw
occasion for negociation and remonstrance. â
For the pr:fent, he wifted to confine our
views to one of the belligerent powers whose
injuries all allowed had given joÂ® cause of
war to this country. He did not mean, Mr.
H. said, to prepare measures for ofte'nfive
v/ar, and he believed w hat the gentleman had
said or. this fubjett was one 01 those pufts
â¢i hich were introduced for no other purpose
than tcround otf a period ; and he was afton
jflied that any gentleman could get his own
tonfent thus to impose upon himfelf.
Mr. Srroreaves said, he called for the
yeas and nays, in onler that he might have an
opportunity of recording his dident to tlie.re
daction of the number of veflels agreed to by
the Senate. He thought it an improper time
to agree to an amendmant of this kind ; he
did not think it proper,, jj. tb&JPffaU. Cri.&S,
to (haw symptoms of distrust, weakness or ti
midity. As the bill proposed sixteen veflels
when it came from the Senate, he did not
with to reduce the number to twelve ; efpeei
ally as it was allowed that sixteen veflels
would not be too many, and the only reason
so* reducing the number was, that a greater
number could not he immediately got ready
in the recess of Congress ; but having no
doubt that if sixteen veffils are neceirary, the
President would be able to procure them, he
{hould be ag&inftConcurring with the amend
ment of the committee of the whole.
Mr. Livingston was proceeding to re
mark upon wh;Â»t had fallen from the gentle
man from S. Carolina, of a personal nature,
whin the Speaker called to order and h: fat

"That the Secretary of War, previous to

April, 1798./ V
The reading' being (irfVflieii Mr, W. C.
Claiborne (aid, that, in his opinion, this
claim was founded on the principles of j ill
tice ; and he trulled every member who had
attended t# the reading of the documents,
must accord with himMn opinion, tftat the
Nickajack expedition undertaken by Major
James Ore in 1794, into the Lower Clierokee
country, was authorized by General Robert -
son ; and it remains now to be decided wheÂ»
ther soldiers fta'l not be entitled to pay, until
they have previously aCTnred themselves Â«f
the legitimate authority of their commanding
officer At a time when this expedition was
set on foot, the war raged between the Uni
ted States and the Cherokee Nation of Indi
ans, the horrors of which bore hard upon the
diftrift of Mero v'the very exigence, of the
fettlemenr was threatened ; Jfcarceiy a day
patted without some one or other of the inha
bitants, or of their icqtiaintance, being mur
dered, Information was received that the
Indian? were'embodied, in order to carry war
into the fettle menf. What was the general
to do I "Was he to (land (till without making
any attempt so avert thÂ« danger ? The faft
ty of the people required liiio to ,and he
struck dye fir# btow, which was a deftnfivo
meafu,rc,authorized by the ufoge of ail Nati
ons. The citizens on this .expedition obey
ed the command of their officer; <he.y did not
think it neCessary to enquire by what autho
rity he afted ; all for them !Â« be afeertained
of was, that he was an officer Â«f the United
States, and this they well knew, a? this was
not the firft time they had served under him.
Without a difeipiine of this kind no military
operation could be csftried on. General Ro
bertfon aftedalfo under the authority of Go
vernor B'ount, who a&ed undert+ieorders of
the PreCJtnt of the United Stales. Having
then performed this dutyâa duty too which
put an end to a war which rrijjht have cost
the United States a million of dollarsâhe
trusted tbe petitioners would be compensated
for their ferviccs. The amount, he believ
ed, would not be more that? about 4,000 dol
lars, as the party was oujonly twelve days.
To effect this purpose, hÂ» proposed the fol
lowing refohition for the jdoption of the com
mittee :
" Resolved, that the pnper officers be direifted
to fett'e the aseounts of tie Militia who served on
the expcdicion commandid by major Jjmes Ore a
gainst the Cherokee Indent, in the year 1794-'
This resolution Wis agreed to without op
position. The committee ro(e; and after
lome ftp--âs'teu â¢" â Â»'

port a bill accordingly.
A metfage was received from the President
of the United States informing the house that
, he had approved ind signed an aft to autho
rise a loan for the city of Washington, and
an aft for reimburing certain expences of the
Canfuls of the Unted States.
The Senate, bf meifage, informed the

TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

Sin,
The citirens of Alexandria,viewing with
the liveliest apprehenlions the alarming jur
ation of our political differences with the
republic'of France, as detailed in the com
munications of our Envoys.at Paris to the
Secret*ry of State, and -defirpus of evincing
their attachment to the government of their
country,"and a virtucujs indignation at any
attempt to infringe its national sovereignty
have commifiioned us to to you the
encloftd refolutioris ex pre dive of their sen
timents upon fubjefts so important and in
terefling to the peace, dignity and prosper
ity of the United States. We have seen
with anxious regret, the giadual dissolution
of those ties of gratitude and afFedtiou,
which have so long attached America to the
interests of France ; but when that
tion is violated by the groffeA injuries ;
when an exprefiion of gratitude becomes
our reproach, and we are smarting under
the lash of unprovoked aggreflioni ; when
every attempt at amicahle negotiation has
been fruftrated, it becomes the indispensa
ble duty of a free people to vindicate the
insulted honor of its national character.
We embrace, Sir, with peculiar fatis
faftion, this favorable opportunity of ex
pressing to you, the warm acknowledgment*
of a grateful people for your truly wife and
patriotic exertions to preserve the tranquiji
ty of your country. The measures adopt
ed and pursued by the executive of (Jie
United States meet our warmest approba
tion ; and though many attempts have been
made to separate us from the government
cf Bur choice, and the- difference of politi
cal fentrment has been the means employed
foi> that purpose, yet be tffured we will ever
repel with unanimity and energy, every effort
ofa foreign power to diminish our rights as
an independent nation. We take a pride in
expr'dfimg to you, Sir, our .entire approba
tion of the re&itude and integrity of your
administration. We are plea fed to fee thoje
virtues and talents so often exercised for the
"benefit 6fyour country in the Jute revolu
tionary conteft,again exert-dinthedifcharge

Yesterday, the House of Representatives of
the United States went into a corrimittee of
the whole on the rtate of the Union on the
fubjeft of Aliens. After some few obierva
tions, Mr. Otis withdrew the amendment'
which tie had before proposed, and the three
resolutions reported were then agreed to with
out opposition, unanimously. The committee
lol'e, when Mr. Otis moved to amend the
last resolution by adding after what is said a
bout invasion and predatory incurftons, these
words, or J.tall authorize hostilities againjt the
United States." After this amendment had
undergone considerable debate, Mr. Allen
propoled one which fuperceded it, extending
the provision foas to give power to the Preli
dentto fend out of thecountry a// aliens whom 1
he should think dangerous to the peace of the
country. After considerable debate Mr. A.
withdrew his proportion, when the queltion
on Mr. Otis's amendment returned, and it
was negatived 55 to 27. It having been sug
gested that there was no provision in the reso
lution, in cafe this country should find it ne
cefiary to declare war against France, Mr.
Sew all introduced the following words,
" between tuhorn and the United bates Jbitll

MR. FENNO,
At the commencement of tire war for
our independence, among other recjuifites
a particular attention to the breeding of
flieep was ft enuoufly recommended by eve
ry enlightened patriot. England owes its
present ftre gth to their attention to th*feÂ«
important little animals, as a memento of
which, their judges and ruler* are featcd on
sacks of wool.
Farmers tail Notice !
There were killed during the last year,
near two millions of Ewes, although* five
millions in addition to the present number,
would not form a moderate stock for the
United States. Calcufcte the saving that
the Sparing of the Ewes and Lambs for this
year may produce to yonr country, and
you wiil withhold the bloody knife at least
for one season.
democratic desponbency.
It is delightful to observe that the few
rancorous, inveterate and Frenchified demo
crats who ft ill hang on to their (battered
cause, are compelled to confefs their weak
ness and defeat, and fliapt their sentiments
and toasts accordingly. Defertedb? the -
merican people, broken up in and
staggering to their political graves in scat
tered and contemptible gangs, they will
shortly become objefls of public pity or
disgust. At the Northern Liberty fan
dango, where fenftble 'squire Coates and
cute Billy Robinson (the old one) who re
ceived such a handsome trimming from the
chief juftiee some time since for his impar
tial conduit as a public magistrate, and is
â¢ also famous for his patriotic ccndufl in the
riot at the frigate, pretided at this last ce
lebration of French influence.
I find the seventh toast thusâ
Â« Afbert GallatinâMay his virtues and his
talents meet their'due reward in the appro
bation of his country."âln this tosft I
heartily unite ; but as his country know*
nothing virtues and talents as yet,
I presume it is intended that he (hall pn(h
off for Geneva in order to receive this re
ward. But if hi is really to have his due
r*ivard, I have no objeftion to his taking
it in this country. The governor could not
interfere as he did in the cafe of the Irilh
cobler a few months since.
Another toast is the The minority m con
gressâHere is the confeftion of defeatâre

It vuthon, the treeacni. ana t.,arp,...
of the United State*, and representing the
citizens of America aa a divided people, is
such as patriotism, naturally nd necessari
ly inspiresâThe of every' republic in
Europe however, from Poland, to Geneva,
has given too much cause far such thoughts
and proje&s in out enemies and such appre
hensions in our frieads and ourselves.
Republics are alfafa divided in opinions
concerning forms of governments, and plans
>nd details of administrationâ-these divi
fionsare generally harmless, often salutary
and feldem very hurtful, except when fo
reign nation* interfere and by their arts,
and agents excite, and ferment them into
parties and fadions : such interference ana
influence mufl be refilled and exterminated
or it will end in America, as it did ancient
ly in Greece, and in our own time in Eu
rope, in our total dcftru&ion, as a epubli
ean goverimeut, and independent power.
The liberal applause you bestow *n the
measures pursued by the government, for
the adjustment of differences, and restora
tion of harmony, your fefolutions of resist
ance in preference to fubmifiion to any fo
reign powÂ»r ; your confidence in the gov

of defence of the country, and prote&ion
of its commerce, and your generous reso

dom of the United States, are received with
much refpeft.
