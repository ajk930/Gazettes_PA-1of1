TUESDAY EVENING, Sfptemijfr iÂ».
From tht ttF.IV-rORK GAZETTE, Ufc.
There feetns to eiift a degrading opinion among
foihe of our American patriots .-âthat â¢ve
ry man in this country hiuft be attached either
to France of England. The real partizans of Bri
tish ascendancy, and the American fans culottes,
both entertain this ridiculous sentiment, at leal)
in appearahte, and make it the engine for accom
plilhing their refpeSlive views. The real fait
however, is, that there are THREE parties in the
United Statesâone h mdly devoted to Great Bri
tainâanotherroFfariceâeach very cordially-detefts
the other) and vifbes them to the devil. But,
there is a third class, c jnfiOing of principled Ame
ricans ; who contended for our glorious indep ,n
( <Jence ; factificed their health, ease and property in
i's defence ; and who, reje<9ing with conteaipt the
idea of partial attachments fa any nation, crtlu
lively, bellow all their regard upon that dear coun
tryi for ths def.nce of whi-h they so no ly fought
and fuffcred. Thfee are our true patriots, upon
whom dependance can be placed in the trying hÂ»ur
of dangerâand not the vagaVonds who fly frorti
perfection for villainies in their native land, and
here enter as hirelings, into the service of those
who 'iaringly advocate the robbery and oppression
exercised hy Great Britain and France upon our
dÂ«fencelefi trade.
A filly paragraph in Grsenleaf's paper, it writ
ten wholly under the impreflion that the people of
this country are all either partisans of the Britilh
or French. The â  author mull he some foreigner
â  recently imported, who knows nothing of the dis
position of our genuine citizens, and who for the
fake of dabbjinj among the dirty calumnatorsof
American merit throws out a firing of political ab
furditiesta exhibit hiina ive ignorance of the coun
try which has admitted him. ThÂ« paragraph is so
donfiru"d as to induce a belief that the writer is a
Irienii to America- but the cloven foot is obvious
from the partiality he shews to one fct of our ene
mies, while he i itterly declaims agtinft the other.
Of all suchâos theabufersof our ejcellent pub
lie officers, and defamcrs of tried merit, we fhouM
bewareâand never admit what they aflcrt, until
it is proved to a demonftrationâfor, a fellow who
will profiittlte himfelf for money to advocate any
cause without regard to principle, is a bad member
of focieyâai.d like all Liars, he (hould be fuf
re*2ed if even by ehancf he DF.VIATES into
TRUTH.
The following. <tve Lrtieve, is tit paragraph to llb'ub
the above tvritcr bsu refertnte.
The ABI'SF. wMch is continually poured forth
from certain prefiVi in the United States against the
French people noil mvact every candid obfsrver
that a fa&ion exists in this country ini ical to our
confiitution and to the eenuine rights of the peo

the French with setting fire o our ci'iesand towns,
answers from the Spanili miniiVer to the French

and a number of kther publications, which, too c
vidcntly, bear the marks of fallhoad and decep

Irjarr the filler republic, we mud naturally sup
pose. that the authors are inimical to the princi

den the breach between the citizens of the two
countries. I.et the republicans ps the United States
be attentive to the proceedings of a Britiffi party

Jleady reader ofyourpaperthis morning got hold
of the urora ofThurfday lajl, -wherein heJinds
the following paragraph, -which, with the re
marks subjoined, I would thank you to publijh.
' j! *r4l ftDEHALUT.
The Gazettes of the faction are indefati
gable in their endeavors to render the French
and the French revolution odioiu here. For
this purpose they have plundered the whole
Billingfgatc vocabulary for epithets to lavish
oil them, and have ransacked every rancor
oui monarchical account of the revolution
for distorted instances of barbarity commit
ted during the revolutionary fever. These
they are every day retailing as true pi&ures
of the scenes exhibited on the theatre of
France during that period. The friends of
humanity and republicanism weep over the
few 'excefles of which some .individuals in
France, taking advantage of the troubled
moments of a revolutioh, have been guilty ;
but these friends of order feaft on them in
the Irue spirit of canibalifm, a spirit so con
genial with their favoritefyftemâMonarchy.
REMARKS.
On the above paragraph a correspondent
remarks that the Aurora, that wretched
fink of scurrility, personality and defama
tion, after some little repose from its dirty
labors, has resumed its wonted style. The
friends of decency, order and virtue will
however, not be deterred from exposing the
villainies of our domestic Jacobins, or repro
bating the piratical measures of foreign ene
mies, whether British or French. The Au
rora, and some other gafceites of a similar
completion, have incessantly trumpeted the
fouleft charges against the friends of Ame
rica labored with a zeal truly merce
â¢nary to palliate the enormities of rascals
who are censured even in FranceâWhy is
this done ? It is an evident proof that we
have a faftion among us, which detefl every
thing virtuous and good, and love whatev
er is politically or morally bad !âSuch a
faction defervr discountenance, and it is a
truth very pleasing to the friends of order,
that it is now rapidly declining in creditâ
In refpeftability it has always been deficient.
â The true spirit of patriotism is exhibited by
an attachment to our countiy, and enmity
to her foes of whatever nation they may beâ
but he who attaches himfelf to one foreign
nation exclusively, and not only reprobates
every other,'but his own too, when the fa
vorite foreign power thinks proper to in
jure her, is a detestable character, and me
rits banishmentâSuch is Bache, and some
others that could be namedâMen who to
elevate the nation they worlhip, would not
scruple to facrifice the interests, and pros
trate the' political independence of the li
nked States at its feet. In France, the at
trocities of the jacobin faftion are freely and
openly exposed, and its abettors held up to
public execration for having deluged the
country in blood. The colonial agents are
re-called for having eflablifhed the reign of
terror, and milder charafters sent to replace
them. Notwithftandiag these evidences of
j a change f or tiie better in France, our ja
cobins are (till favorable to the ancient ex
ploded system bf terror, arid cannot with
out the keenest Feelings fee ill the Ame
rican gazettes a republication of what is dai
ly printed in France and read with avidity a
gainst the murderous fattellitesof Robespierre.
The Valuable writer who has exposed the
crimes of the Sanguinary Robefperian fac
tion, ha 3 ira-.uortalized his nameâand the
translator wha gives the American reader
an opportunity of becoming acquainted
with the fafts, and whose personal know
ledge of many incidents which occurred in
France, enables him to speak positively,
deserves the thanks of America, as well
for his auxiliary labours in making the
tranflatiohs, as for the ; judicious remarks
with which he accompanies them. Baclic
talks like a fool when he fays the favorite
System of the American seder lifts is mo
narchyâ-They contended against a monarch
seven years, and after liberating their coun
try, eflablifhed a free government op the
purest republican principles. This is the
system they adore, and to this system they
cling. They are sure that our present form
of government is the bed ever devised by
the understanding, or conceived by the wit
of man. It is the result of matnre delibe
ration and great intelle&ual labour, research
and comparison. Every intelligent Ameri
can is confident it is infinitely preferable to
either the British or French, and every
patriot American will support it against the
hireling efforts of foreign intermrdlers aim
ing to subvert it, and assimilate it to their
own, in order to get us the more completely
under their influence. For this base pur
pofc have such rascals been put in pay as
the writer of the history of the United
States, and the most unprincipled fellows
inftigatedtofet up presses, which, disclaim
ing the truly estimable character of imparti
ality, have been exclujively devoted to the
filth of a faftion. From such Sources have
proceeded the calumnious publications a
gainst Wafrington, Adams, Hamilton, and
the whole catalogue of our revolutionary
worthiesâmen to whom we are deeply in
debted, andto whom this country will feel
its obligations while freedom exists among
us, or one man attached to the genuine
principles of repuolicanifm can be found,
either in tK or any other country on earth. 'â

Mr. Rand,
" A true patriot" on Wednesday last hav
ing announced, by found of Trumpet, his
fafe return from an European expedition ;
permit an inhabitant of Portland, in behalf
of his fellow citizens, to congratulate him
upon his happy arrival, and to express a
most feeling concern at the " furpr'tzing and
Jhocting" revolution in political Sentiments,
which he observes to have taken place in
this country. As the refpeflability and
importance of a nation, depend in a high
degree upon the wealth and abilities of its
citizens, no Sacrifice can be esteemed too
great, to indcc.gentlemen of this descripti
on, to honour our country with their resi
dence. To promote this desirable objeft, a
Priejlley was affectionately received among
us ; who is induftrinus in propagating reli
gious infidelity ; and a Gallatin was admit
ted into the bosom of our national legifla
jure, eagw on every occasion, to excite in
the breasts of our fellow-citizens a Spirit of
discontent and inSurreftion. In order to
continue th's jujl and salutary policy, dnd to
induce a felf-created patriot to enrol himfelf
among those exotie worthies, I would sug
gest to my fellow-citizens, the propriety of
renouncing their correft, independent, and
well-founded political sentiments and opini

Fort St. George, 1
May \<)th, 1795- J
THE range of mountains inland of the
five northern Circars, is inhabited by a class
of men who differ from the natives in the
circumjacent low country, in their appear
ance, religion, manners, and language.
This class of men, generally denominated
Conds, or hill people, is branched out into
fix tribes, named the Condowar, Lowrawar,
Condulwar, Contulwar, Pudmawar, and
Budcondawar. All their Six tribes, or fa
miliea, are to be found on the hills inland of
Vizagapatnam and Poody, but only the
two firit on the Barampore hills. They
all have nearly the fame language and cuS
toms, and live Solely on the Summit and
Sides of the mountains, from which they
come down to the villages below, on the
: Shandy, or weekly market days, bringing j
Small grain, dye-ftufft, and other articles,
which they exchange for eoarfe cloth, cut
lery, &c.
The Conds are Squat and ttiitScular,. their
colour is dark, their features very harfti, and
their language guttural. They go entirely
naked excepting a bit of cloth about their
loins. Their women Sometimes cover their
breasts as well as their loins, and a Single
piece of eoarfe cloth fuffices for both pur
poSes.
I They are unacquainted with the uSe of
â  letters, and no Bramins frecjuent or dwell
i with them. They are extremely fuper-fliti
ouÃ, and have among them priests and priest
esses, who are a fort of conjurors. They
call the former Punnoo and the latter Dean
nee. They perform none of the ablutions
fp common to the other oriental casts. In
point of manners they are almofl. as rude
and wild as elk and bear, their fellow inha
bitants of the hills.
Every village clefts a head man, who ad
justs all matter of dispute among his consti
tuents, wha are in a perfeft equality.
They acknowledge .Scarcely any obedience
to the Zemindars of the low country, who
think it their interest to cajole the head men
to visit them, on which otcafions they give
them trifling preSents and abundance S
pariah arrack, of which liquor, and of
buffalo flefh, the Conds are escefiively fond.
They are in general a simple, and very
inoffenfive race, but have ideas ofboth pro
perty and independence. They will not al
low the trees growing on their hills to be
cut down without their Sanction, both
which and theiraffilance to drag and roll
the felled wood, are readily purchafcd by a
very small sum.
When prevailed on by insurgent zemin
dars to take a part in their quarrels, tht*jjare
a fnifchievous enemy, as they Sally from
the hills during the night, into the plains be
low, fire the villages, and destroy jr carry
off the grain and cattle. All pursuits of
tnem among the hills is fruitleSs, as they as
cend the heights with amazing speed from
their perfeft knowledge of the declivitiesand
ascents, and can without rifle to themfelve*
either elude or assail their pursuers. Every
Cond is arfnecfr with a hooked knife,
with with he cuts down bamboos and trees,
or behAds the unhappy captive. They use
flings, and bows and arrows, and where the
situation is Savoutable, they have large
stones ready placed to roll down on their as
sailants.
TheSe notices were afforded by a Jungum
(a religious mendicant,) of Barampore. His
information was taken down in Persian by a
moonfhee, from whose manuscript the above
is translated.
POLITICAL REFLECTIONS.
The governor and the governed, whatever
be the form of government proposed, are
men partaking of the interests and passions of
men. Let us then take the feelings of pri
vate, interest, and the passions of men into
our estimate of what government is best for
them ; and let us too consider those interests
and passions as cxiftent under the aftual cir
cumstances of the times.
The question then is, not what govern
ment is best for men in a state of great pu
rity of manners, Simplicity of knowledge,
general competency to all, without riches
to any, and contentment in private life,
keeping down generally the ambitioaof pub
lic life.
We must take men as they are, we must
not take them as the poets describe Shepherds
of Arcadia, and those of the golden age.
We must take men who follow trade and
commerce, beeaufe trade and commerce
bring money ; and, who Seek money, be
cauSe money gratifies their lusts and appe
tites.
We must take men who Seek power, be
eaufe power not only may reach wealth by
(horter strides, but moreover gratify vanity
and other passions extraneous to those merely
sensual. I
We must take men, who, in all claffcs of
life, reach as high towards the enjoyments
which power or wealth may give, as their
means will afford : and who, if too low' to
reach at all, in their envy and discontent
give proof of what they seek, and what
they would do if they could. In short, we
must take men for the most part, and in their
general community, who abuse, or are rea
dy to abuse both power and wealth.
The love of power and of wealth are of so
quick growth, and are so fatal to any insti
tution of government which is not framed
under consideration of their influence that no
democracy, or republic leaning to a demo
cracy, ever lasted an entire century. It be
came an aristocracy, or it submitted to the
usurpation of an individual; and in its latter
years of duration as a republic was convulsed
and diftrafted by these jarring influences,
and at all times was a scene of disquiet in it
falf, and of unhappinefs. to mankind.
Generally a democratic people on their
ouÂ»fet of republican establishment have been
ruinous to the quiet and happiness of all
people near them ; and afterwards have left
as great unhappinefs from commotions a
mong them/elves, as heretofore they brought
on others by their wars and disposition to
contest. Priftina mala poftquam foris"deer
ant, doini qucerere, is by Livy applied to
Rome. â¢*"
The tendency of tlÂ»e passions and interests
of men in such governments ever takes its
direftion to the attainment or support of
the executive department. It is the struggle
for executive power on which the -whole turns.
It is a question truly of great concern
whether executive authority in government
canbefoplacedand guarded as to be without,
and beyond the reach of those passions and
influences which tend to eorrupt the pec-ple
and destroy the state, and yet be within the
reach of controul and restrained from all ex
ertion to the prejudice of the liberties and
rights of the people.
The operation of struggles for the exe
cutive power in Smaller commonwealths, and
republics in general, is equally deftruftive to
\ domejl'tc happinejs, and to political injlitutitjn.
| Let usTuppofe a competition of iifcen&mt
. characters. There ever have been, for the
j most part, and always will be, able and "en
j terprifing men flruggling together for as.
ccndemy. These buly and ambitidua men
are seldom so virtuous as to be nice about
the means, so that they attain their ends,
Human ingenuity will soon be exercised hnd
well practised in all the adls to gain or to
cheat the people, to reduce, to corrupt, or
to deceive J whilst the animosity of contend
ing parties, permits not either to fee that
in the end the people are merely cavilling
for who shall eftablirti despotism in the per
son of their own chuling ; of perhaps two
or three parties find it necefiary to join their
forces ; and the result * the worst of all
governments an hateful aristocracy.
During these struggles no end bf good
government is answered. There is'no"peace,
there is no private happiness, no security of
per/on, no security a! property ; there is little
too of lilerty as applied to the individual sta
tion. The majority in a democratic assem
bly.ever have tyrannized over the minority ;
the general pi&ure of a democracy is of a
party conquering, and of a party subdued ;
of a party oppressing, and a party fuffering ;
an alternate abuse of power, and vicissitude
of murders, exi e and conjfcations.
Thus all democratic republics havefallen and
â willfall, and be of (hoi t duration, from the
impracticability of so ordaining the execu
tive power, as not to be the oljeiJ of undue
praftices, and not to be the means of undue
influence ; the one tending to corrupt, and
the other to overturn the political institution.
In such a republic, constant struggles and
animosities, and a constant mfecUrity of
property and unfafety of person, chafe all
djmejlic happiness to a distance ; and what
eompenfation have the republican people for
this loss ?
I have /hewn the mifchiefs which the
ftiuggles for executive power occasion in a
republican government, and remarked the
successive fa ft ions and disturbances, destroy
ing all domestic security of individuals, and
â  all peace and happiness in the community.'
I have {hewn that these ftruggle3 in the
end go to destroy the republic itfelf, and con
firm one man, or one set of then, in "power and
| tyranny.
[ The following Relation of the Majfatre of
the Inhabitants of an American town by a
body of French troops, and their Indian
auxiliaries, is extraÃed from " the hijlory
of the Five Indian Nations" by Cadwalla
der Col den.
1 he Count De Frontenac being defiraiis
to raffe the drooping spirits of the French
in Cmada, by keeping them in aftion, and
engaging the most daring of them, in enter
prizes that might give courage to the reft,
had sent out three parties against the Eng
lish colonies, in hopes thereby to lesson the
confidence which the Five Nations had in
the English assistance, now that England
had declared war against France. The par- *
ty sent to New-York was commanded by
Monfr. Dc Herville, and was ordered to at
tempt the surprising of Scheneftady, the
nearest village to the Mohawks : It consisted
of 150 French Bufh-lopers or Indian trad-rs,
and of as many Indians, the most of them
French converts from the Mohawks, com
monly called the Praying Indians, fettled at~
a place near Montreal, [called Cahnuaga.
They were well acquainted with all that
part of the country round Scheneftady ;
and came in fight of the place the Bth of
February 1689-90.
The people of ScheneÂ£tady were at that
time in the greatest security, notwithstand
ing that they had information from the In
dians, of a party of French, and French In
dians being upon their march that way.
They did not think it prafticable, in ihat
season of the year, while it was extremely
cold, and the whole country covered with
fuow. Indeed Europeans will hardly thrnk
it pofiible, that men could make such a
march through the wildernefsin the severest
frofts, without any covering from the hea
vens, or any provision, except what they
carried on their backs.
Tho* the people of Schenefkady were in
formed in the evening before the place was
surprised, that several fculking Ihdians were
seen near the place, they concluded, that
they could be only some of the neighboring
IndianS ; and as they had no officer of anv
esteem among them,, not a single man could
be persuaded to watÂ«h in such severe weather,
though, as the French owned afterwards, if
they had found the least guard or watch,
they would not hpve attempted the place,
but have surrendered themselves p.rifoners :
They were so exceedingly distressed with
the length of their march, and with cold
and hunger, but finding the place in fatal
security, they marched into the heart of the
village, without â  being discovered by any
one person ; then they raised their war shout,
entered the hordes, murdered every perfort
they met, men, women and children, naked
and in cold blood ; and at the fame time
set fire to the houses. A very few efeaped,
by running out naked into the woods in this
terrible weather : And several hid themselves
till the firft fury of tltc attack was over;
but these were soon driven from their lurk
ing places by the fire, and were all made
prisoners.
The French marched back, without reap
ing any visible advantage from barbaroti*
enterprise, betides the murdering fixty-threc
innocent perfans in cold blood, and carrying
twenty-feveri of them away prisoners.

inanded by captain GrayâShe failed from

LONDON, July 17. 2
NEGOCIATION AT LISLE. t
Until some more precise and definitive an
swer (hall Jsave arrived from Lisle, and we are ' t
award that it is not easy to speculate upon ; y
the event of negpciations ; but, as we have
taken peculiar pains to inform ourfelyes up- ;
on this fubjeft, and as we have means of ac
quiring intelligence-upon it, it may be per- t
mitted to us to inake /some remarks upon c
those circutn/cances which have hitherto oc
curred in the negociation. j
It reported at Lisle, and we have re
ceived this report from authority which we ; j
cannot doubt, that the restitution of the f
{hips taken at Toulon, or an equivalent for
them, is considered by the French as a. fine
qua w,n of the treaty.
Wc are not accurately informed as to the
condition in which these (hips were taken, j.
tut we recollect that on certain terms they
â were to be delivered up. to the French na- f
tion at the peace. Now we cannot think j
that, whether the stipulation goes to the ]
restitution of these (hips upon peace being j
made with the direftory, or with any other j
supposed government in France, it can be an (
obstacle to the restoration of these (hips, if j
such be considered as a material point by the ,
French goveri/ment, and if, in confcqucnce |
of acceding to it, we can get any thing that j
is Â©f importance to ourselves. The (hips .
taken ct Toulqp are, in fail, of scarcely
any value to us.
The temper of the French commissioners
was very different from that of Monf. Dela- ,
croix ,upoa lord Malmefbury's firft embassy,
and instead of reserve and coldness, and a l
disposition to break off the negociation, they ,
(hewed the mofl decided inclination to Â«n- v ,
tertain and discuss every proposition which
could be offered on the part of Great-Britain.
Such is the substance of private informa- ,
tion which we have obtained from Lisle. ]
We do not hesitate to fay, that we think, as
far as we can judge from the conferences
lord Malmefbury has held with the French
commissioners, and the general disposition
of the people of France, that the prof eft
is FAVORABLE TO THE ATTAIN
MENT OF PEACE.
The extraordinary preparations for war
the part of the king of Pruflia, of which
we have received intelligence by the Brussels
papers, now appear to have been undertaken
with a view to hostilities with the court of
Vienna The important state paper, may
be considered as the prelude to the com
mencement of a war between Pruflia and
Austria.
king of Prussia's having opposed the
decree of the Aulic council against his usur
pation in Franconia, is confirmed by the mail,
which contains his proclamation on the fub
jeft. Every thing feemt to threaten a rup
ture between the two courts of Berlin and
Vienna.
The equipage of the archduke Charles 1
is arrived at Schwetzingen.
Prague is putting in a compleat state of
defence.
The troubles at Turin go on increasing,-
and 10,000 French troops have marched for
that capital.
A strong fleet has failed from Venice with
a large body of French and Venetian sailors
on board, "for the Venetian Islands in the
Levant.
Last evening arrived here the (hip Apol
lo, Loring, and the brig Hannah, the for
mer-in 61, and the latter in 50 days from
Hull; and the (hip Commercian, Parker,
in 42 days from St. Kitts. By way of N.
London, the (hip Augusta from Londonder
rp, with 180 passengers.
The (hip Edinburgh Packet Farquhar,
arrived at Leith 0.1 the 22d of June.
A London paper of the 19th July, "by
the brig from Hull, mentions the arrival or
difpatchei from the emperorâA cabinet
council was immediately calledâand it was
conjeÃured that they breathed a spirit of re
newal of hostilities.
Another paragraph mentions a Courier
from Lord Malmefbury, who it was said
brought dispatches of such a nature as to do
away the belief that a speedy termination of
war would take place, on account of the
exhorbitants demands of the FrenchâThese
however, are only editorial conje&uves.
From the Argvi.
The Roebuck, from Hamburgh, and the
Merchant, from London, arrived at this
port on Saturday, after long passages.
Our accounts, from both these ports, are
jater tjhan they bring.
Yesterday the British packet Harlequin,
Capt. Gray, arrived at this port from Fal
mouth and Halifax, with the july Mail.
The Harlequin failed- from Falmouth on
the 25th July, and brings London accounts
to the 23d, one day later than those via
Boston and Newport this day given verbally.
We bfft-e not been so fortunate as to get
papers by this vessel ; but it would seem,
that her accounts are of no great impor
tance. The negiciatkns for peace were go
ipg slowly on, bilt nothing transpired. Hope,
meet*fid hope, that {heet anchor of the foul,
was ft ill entertained, that the result of the
rWocintions * would be t LAcii* : but, the
IVrcr.ch commissioners, in tur.i, fen! couriers
at every proposition !
A London paper, however, publishes, as
leaking out, that Malmefbury had agreed o
to give up all his conquests from France, ti
including the Toulon (hipsâthat the French (
commiffionsr demanded all the Spanish con- g
qutfts fhou'id also be given up, but this was
wavefl, as to become a future fubjeft "of
negociationâthat (he King of Pruflia having
fiezed upon Nuremburg, an imperial city, the
emperors of Russia and Germany had de
clared war against him ! ! !
Of all TOUGH STORIES circulated E
yesterday (and which will, doubtless, be ti
sent on post haste to Philadelphia, by some e<
busy letter writer) the following are worthy p
notingfi
That neyv wars had broken out between m
Austria and FranceâThat Paul I, Enspe- w
rorofall the Ruffias, had marched 180,000 g
troops to the assistance of Austriaâthat the
negociation for peacs had broken offâthat
the Spanish Court had offered Lord' St. ft
Vincent, alias Admiral Jervis, 20 millions 31
of dollars to be off, &c. &c. After which m
in came a hog to be shaved. ,
We (hall give Extrafts to-morrow, nor
tire our readers with the milliard of rumours
on this arrival. t\
The Coffec-Houfe report, of capt. N
Barney, falls to the ground. fii
Also arrived yesterday, the brig Hannah, ri
Robins, and (hip Apollo, Loring, both hi
from Hull. 1 P * d;
Captain Robins, on the 4th day of Au- m
gust, was boarded by the French privateer 01
Heureux, of Bourdeaux who overhauled his tli
papers and difraiffed him. This privateer
had captured a (hip from Africa for Liver
pool <jn the 26th July (whose crew they put
on board of an American brig bound to A m " m
fterdam, name unknown) and the brig f<
Plumper, Capt. Reid on the 2d Aliguft, v<
bound from Jamaica to London. Capt. m
Reid and a black man were put on board el
the Hannah. Sept. 2, lat. 38, long. 60, a

There were several thousands of troops at

A few days before the Hannah failed, a

that the greatest distress was visible in every Â«

INFORMATION to OLD PEOPLE,
How they may preserve the eye-fight, or re
cover it after it has failed.
This is to bie done while you wa(h, by
dipping your face in the water, opening
your eyes, and keeping them open under
water as long as you can hold your b'reath.
Do this three or four times fucceflively eve
ry morning. t
It will be expefted, no doubt, that I
should give an account how I came by tlv's ;
knowledge ;it was in this manner :âI !
knew, early in life, that wafliing with cold j
water was good against the tooth-ach, and :
I have long used that romedy with fucceft.
Some years ago I went out a long journey
towards the North, and among other incon
veniences, I fuffered the want of cold wa
ter to wa(h with according to my enftom ;
this brought on a violent tooth-ach ; 011 my
return I loft several teeth. I applied close
ly my former remedy, which at length took
away the tooth-ach * but was irot efficacious
enough to remove a pain in my gums, at
the roots of my upper teeth, and I expefted
to lose them all. A little better than a year
ago, a poor old man (whom I had long
1 known) begged of me a spot of land to cul
tivate : I gave it him within a quarter of
a mile of my house. Soon after, I difcoÂ£-
ered (by the thermpineter) that his spring
was cooler than mine, and I determined to
. wafli there. He fitted up a rough table at
his spring for my use, with a large pewter
bason, which he placed on it every mornings
i I go early to wa(h, and after wafliing I dip
1 my face under water and open my eyes,
keeping them so as long as I can hold my
t breath, three or four times fucceflively.
, If I recolleft well, it is auout a year
. lince I began to do this, and I am relieved,
. not only of the pain in the gums as I expeft
ed, but I have also recovered my fight,
, which I did not expeft. lam not far (hort
e of 70 years old, and I have used fpeftacles
e about five and twenty years,, but I have late
i ly layed'them aside, having now (thank
God) nooccafion for them.
As this may be ufeful to all pei sons at
one time or other, I wish it may be known Fr
to them, and deGre that benevolent printers
(feeing the utility of it) will be jjieafed to Jo!
give it a place airiong their publications. Ge

CAUTION.
WHF.REAS a combination of men in thi<
county have undertaken to enrich th.m
felves,by fabricating titles to sundry valuable tradi
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New
Yoik, Philadelphia, London ana Paris, for which
trails of Und large sums of money have been paid
to thf.fe fraudulent men, by innocent puriiafers â 
It is therefore just that public information fhotild
begivai, to the end, that the injured may ftckre
dreft while the men have property, and are to be
found, fhofe who have been discovered are Tru
nin Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
fevcral others who go under fi&itious names. It is
supposed that the lands offered fcr faler.n those fa
bricated titles, are at least worth fifty thousand
dollars. Suchtas we have aflual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. 11 and la, Otfegu patent,
thousand acres each, the ailual property of William
Dellwjn, now of London ; lots No. 58 ami 64,
si.me petcne, thonfand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chamuont, now of Paris, and ;amcs ATeriU 1
and others, ot tlai> State. There is some grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
Charles Whaj-ton, of Philadelphia, are under their
managementâThe Printers will do well to give j
this a place in their papers, as well to caution tlv:
public against purchasing those lands, as also to de
prive those men in future from imposing on iftdivi- 1
du.ifs, which their education and address have en- i
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has becu
a shopkeeper of some note in this country.
The following affidavits will set in a clear point
of view the wickedness of those men,which wh.n
the public have perused, will indute them to ex
cufc the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 28th, 17j7.
I Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hiv
ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
-1 ruman Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for lot N0..58, Otfego patent, which
was the property of William T Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others; and further the said Joseph
Truman did perfuademc to do,this against my
inclination, which was made out on the iith day
of November, 1793, or set back two years so is
to bring it to that time ; and further the.name ol
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fc&itious nam--,
there being no such perlon there. To I make

sand acres of land in the Otego patent, and pro
mised this deponent a fliare of the profits, on the
sale of said lands, for his so doing ; and tint they
made application fevcral times for the fame purpo>,
which fervicas this deponent as often refufed, de- |
claring to them that hetliad no right to lands, and
could do no such thing ; which daring attempt on
this deponent's integrity he had related among his

where he is reedy to receive all elairas or inflruftiuos

for the purpole of bringing forward the fame agree
ably so the rules and orders which the board may
think proper to prcfcribe.
And as it will be tor the i>.tercft of all concerned,
that the several claims be so ftatcd, and support.
Ed, as to prevent the delay which would arile irom
the neceffityof obtaining further Information, or ad
ditional materials,from pei loÂ« s reading at a distance,
1 the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the
direction chiefly of ihofe, who, not having employ
ed particular agenfs, may leave the profeeution of
their claims to his charge and management) that all
such claimstought in particular to set forthâ
lft. The proper description and fitnatioa of the

4th The loss and damage incurred or fuflained,
in confequercc of such impediments, whether die

remedy from laofe of time, or othcrcaufes impairing
the value and Jecurity of the debt, which would nr-t
have so operated if such impediment# had notcxifled.
Apd sth The particular ground: aÂ«d reason? on
which the claimant maintains, in the tfcrms of the

The general agent thinks it his duty further to sug

sworn and regularly attested, both as to the exigence

as may be within their own knowledge reff e&ively.
