*/ Resolved, That the confuting and vi- a ,

hive it in contemplation to publish on Mon

during .the present calamity, 3 Hate of the n
health of the Cityfand Liberties, including y,
; th? public Hospital: they therefore request c
â the cpufulting and visiting physicians to fur- c ,
nifh as particulnr a return as possible of the t;

with the; prevailing fever." a
Health Office, OSt. 16, 1797. fc
The Board of Infpcftors having for the ],
information bf their fellow-citizens (by the
foregoing resolution of the 9th inft.) called {
on the physicians connected with the Health t
Office for a ftatc of the Hospital, and a ee
neral state of the sick under their care. The
following is the result. I a
Do&ors Duffield and Stevens, consult- r
j irig physicians, state, that there are now in v
j the Hospital Fifty-four patients, thirty -two ;
los whom are affected with the prevailing fe- c
j ver, and Twenty-two are convalefcSnts (
Doftois Church, Coxe and vifit- :
j ing physicians, state, that since the "gth' c
j inft. they have been called to Ninety-one j
I patients, Twenty-five of whomf have been c
, font to the hospital, four have died, twenty- ;
; eighx are convalescents, the remainder dill (
ill ;%ioll of those patients were in the low- ]
er part of the city and Southvvaikâfive on- f
ly in the Northern Liberties. 1
The Infpedtors of the Health-office at t
an early period of the prevailing fever, re- ,
j commended to the indisposed, an immediate ]
i application for medical aid. The Infpeftors ,
lament that tliia' recommendation has not i
been generally attended toâthe sick and (
those who have the care of them, should
consider that even one day's delay may be at- 1
tended with serious consequences From ,
this cause the mortality has probably been â ]
much increased in the city and liberties, but 1
moll certainly in the hospital, where many
have been admitted in the last stage of the ,
difeafp.
Publilhed by order of the Board,
Wm. Montgomery,
Chairman pro iem.
â  ' '
To the Printer of the Philadelphia Daily
Advertifrr.
Among the viftims of the calamity-os
the present year, the physicians who have
1 fallen appear to to to deserve a peculiar
memorial, as they have ventured their lives,
at the most imminent hazard, to assist their
fellpw citizens in time of great diftrcft.
To mention thefirft and the last of these,
may bring to the remembrance of their par
ticular friends the whote of the melancholy
\ lift ; and to those who were not of their
acquaintance, a revival of their names oc-
I cafionally, may be proper even in future
' times. Dr. Nicholas Way was the fir ft of
this class, who was fpeeaily carried of by
' the mortal disease. He was a man advanced
' beyond the middle stage of life, and has
f been mentioned in the paperaln a refpeft
ful manner as a valuable member of the
1 community. Dr. Plcafants (1 believe) was
the last of the vidtims above alluded to.
Â» He was a young man regretted by hiÂ»
0 friends, as one of those who has left upon
their minds the most undoubted proofs of
b his zeal for the works of charity. The
' other young men were unknown to me, but
, they, and their survivors of the fame class,
? who were much exposed to dire contagion,
â ' have undoubtedly deserved the sympathy of
r all, who, as well as tnyfelf, have been pre
'* ferved'from the mortal sickness.
Of one affecting instance of fach expo
furc I was an unexpected witness A,bout
the time of the interment of Dr. Do'bel,
I was accidentally near the church burying
ground, and 3 carriage waiting near
11, the gate : the men with the chair-wheels
in were returning from the grave, and soon
r " after two young men, who I suppose were
jJ doctors, came towards the carriage ; they
, n appeared in a difpolition fuityd to the
id mournful oceafion ; their youthful friend
t0 was jult deposited in the earth, which no
doubt to them was a solemn scene, and
the? more so on account of their own appa
r 1 rent danger: they had (hewn the last kind
w office to their cotemporary ; and although
,r * Ido not certainly know who the young
rJ men were, I have some reason to believe
,; 1 that Dr. Pleafants might be one of those
itc benevolent tttendantp.
If this memorandum should be accepta
ble to the Printer, it is offered as a general
>rs memorial of the renewed awful period of
t J 1 797Â» when the nearcft relatives, like those
ne in 1793, feparated from each other,
and could not admfhifter in the extremeft
cases a final consolation, or even (hew their
love by the rites of a decent burial.

n<V SINGULAR CUSTOMS,
a * In the island or Metelin, the an
cient Lesbos.
jth EExtractedfrom a paper of the Earl of Char
lemont, in the Jrijh Philosophical Society for
:h .. e 17890* , ....
j The most remarkable thing in this island,
1' is a cuflom by which the women have here
openly usurped those rights of sovereignty
which in other countries are supposed to be
'tn long effcntially to the men. " Contrary,"
,| fays his lord(hip, "to the usage of all other
J countries, the cldeft daughter here inherits ;
era ' and the sons, like daughters every where
prr j else, are portioned off with frr.all- dowers,
cir â¢ or, which is (till worse, turned our penny
| ]ef3 to feck their fortune. If a man hud two
t r c '[ ' daughters, the eldest, at her marriage, isen-
| titled to all her mother's pofTefllons, which
h.: 'â  aie by far the greater part of the family cf
ic!l tnte, as the mother, keeping up her prero.
jut gative, never parts with the power over an}
portion of what (he has brought into tlx
, | family, until thÂ« is forced into it by th(
mawiage of her daughter ; and the father _ did
is also compelled to' r,nin iurtifilf by adding of
whatever he may h tffcraped together by tlu
his industry. The second daughter inhe- ths
rits nothing, and iÂ» condemned to perpetual fen
celibacy'. Sl>e is ililed a which fig- tei
nifies properly a religions woman or nun, fw
and is in effeft a menial servant to her filler,Â« pa
being employed by her in any office (he may ye
fee fit to impose, frequently serving her as thi
waiting-maid, as cook, and often in employ- pe
mentS ft ill more degrading. She, wears a th
habit peculiar to her Situation, which she th
can never change ; a fort of monastic dress, wl
coarse, and of a dark brown. One advan- of
tage,however, (he enjoys over her filler, that fei
whereas the elder, before Carriage, is never tic
allowed to go abroad, or to fee any man, to
her nearest relaitess only Excepted ; the ca- te
logria, except wnen employed in domestic pa
toil, is in this refpeft at perfedl liberty.â !wl
But when the filler is married, the fitua- D
t{on of this poor calogria becomes desperate j G
indeed, and 03 rendered still more humiliat- | u(
ing by the coraparifon between her condition bi
and that of her happy mistress. The mar- ,gt
ried filler enjoys every fort of liberty ; the j th
whole family fortune is hers, and (he spends : w
it as (he pleases ; her hulband is her obfe- cl
quious servant, her father and mother are T
dependent upon her ; (he drefies in a mod th
magnificent manner, covered all over, ac- as
cording to the fafhion of the island, with ra
pearls and with pieces of gald, which are t'e
commonly sequins ; thus continually carry- tl
ing about her the enviable marks of afflu- ar
' ence and superiority, while the wretched ca- fn
â¢ logria follows her as a servant, arrayed in la
â  simple homespun brown, and without the te
mod didant hope of ever changing her con- a:
: idition. Such a disparity may seem intole- tl
â  rable, but what will not custom reconcile ? r:
1 Neither aVe the misfortunes of the family w
' yet at an end. The father and mother, with d
: what little is;left them, contrive by their in- h
I dudry to accumulate a second little fortune ; it
1 I and this, if there (hould be a third daugh- Â«
â¢ tcr, they ar? crfjligqd to give her upon her tl
1 I marriage ; and the fourth, if thfre (hould ti
' fbe one, becorAes her calogria ; and so on f
: I through all tht daughters' alternately.â 6
' I Whenever the daughter is marriageable, (he tl
â  can by cuflom cotnpel her father to procure a
j her a h'ufband ; and the mother, such is the f
power of habit, is enough to join her f
lin teasing him into immediate compliance, c
I though its confequcnces mud be tqually fa- t
I tal and ruinous to both of them. From n
' 1 hencd it happens, that nothing is morÂ« com- i:
mon than to fee the old father and mother I
f I reduced to the utmod indigence, and even a
: I begging about the (Ireets, while their un
' I natural daughters are in affluence ; and we
> I ourfelrts have frequently been fiiown the 'â 
r I eldcfl daughter parading it through the
I town in the greatest splendor, while her mo
> I ther and fidÂ«r followed her as servants and
- I made a melancholy part of her attendant
f I train.
r I " Thefons.as soon as they areofanage to
- I gain a livelihood, are turned out of the fam
e I ily, sometimes with a small present or por- J
f I tion, bnt mort-ffÂ®qucatly without arry thing t
k " Ito support tlicm ; and thus reduced, they t
i I either endeavour to lire by their labour, or I
9 I which is Jhore usual, go on board some trad- '
- I ing vefTclas sailors or servants, remaining a- >
e I broad till they have got together some com-! '
is I petency, and then return home to be hen- j 1
'â¢ I peeked. Some few there are, who, taking | '
is I advantage of the T urki(h law, break through i
n this whimsical custom, who marry their ca- 1
>f I logrias, and retain to.themselves a compe
'* 1 tent provision : but these are accounted men
i' I of a Angular and even criminal disposition,
Â»> and are hated and despised as conformids to
"1 the Turkidi manners, and deserters of their 1
J f I native cudoms ; so that wt may suppose
e- I they are few indeed who have the boldness
Ito depart from the manners of their coun
-- I try, to adopt the cudoms of their detested
J t I masters, and to bra*t the contempt, the de-
I rifion, and the hatred of their neighbours and
g- I fellow-citizens.
ar I Â«< Of all thefc extraordinary particulars
:1s I X was informed by the French cohful, a man
>n 0 f sense, ?nd of indisputable veracity, who
re had refidtd in this illand for several years,
ty I and who Solemnly assured me that every
he I eircumftance was true : but indeed our own
"d I observation left us without the lead room
no I for a doubt, arid the singular appearancei
id I and deportment of the ladies fully evinced
'a- I the truth of our friend's relation. In walK
nd
ing through the town, it ii easy to perceive,
I from the whimsical manners of the female
"g I paflengers, that the women, according to
:ve I the vulgar phrase, nvettr the breeches. Tliey
'fe I frequently (lopped us in !he (Ireets, exam-
I ined our dress, interrogated us with a bold
ta- I and manly air, laughed at our foreign garb
ral I and appearance, and (hewed so little atten
of I
tion to the d<jeent modesty which is, or
sfe 1 ought to be the true charadleriftic of the
er, I sex, that there is every reason to suppose
eft I they would, in spite of their haughtiness,
eir Ibe the kindest ladies upon earth, if they
I were not ftriftly watched-by the Turks,
1 who are here very numerous, and would be
I ready to punish any transgression of their
ungallant law with arbitrary fines. But na
ture and nativemanners will often baffle theef-
I fortseven eftyranny. Inalltheircuftomsthefe
ar- manlyladiesfeenvtohave changed sexes with
for the men. The woman rides astride, the
man sits/sideways upon the horse ;*nay, I
"d, have been effured that the husband's dillin

te- try houses, in the management of which

ker gardens, their tfervants, are all their own ;
ts ; and tbe huftand, frpm every eircumftance
ere 0 f his behaviour, appears to be no other
ers, than his wife's firft perpetually
n y- bound to her service, and (lave to her ca
price. Hence it is that a tradition obtains
en- in the country, that this island was form<;>-
iich ly inhabited by Amazons ; a tradition, how
ef- evi.f, founded upon no ancient history that
-ro- I know of. Sappho, indeed, the moil re
any nowncd female that this island has ever pro
the duced, is said to have had manly inclinati

these inclinations, is imitated by the present tha
female inhabitants, who seem perfectly con- to

sway, without endeavouring irt< any other fit;
, particular to;change the course of nature ; onl
yet will this eircumftance serve to (hew, that to
the women of Lelbos had always fomethiÃg the

tions, which our manners would induce us T"u
to efteim incredible, than this island of Me- to
telin. These lordly ladies are for the mod (hi
part very handsome, in spite of their dress, tia
' which is fiugular and disadvantageous. wl
Down to the girdle, whicb, as in the old ho
I Grecian garb, is raised far above what we co
j usually call the waist, they wear nothing
but a (hist of thin and transparent gauze, c ' e
| green, red or brown, through which every be
thing is visible, their breads only excepted, an
: which they Mver with a fort of handker- 1,1
, chief; and Jns, as we were'informed, the
Turks have obliged them to wear, while P e
: they look upon it as an incumbrance, and cl<
. as no inconsiderable portion of Tflrkjfh ty- mi
i ranny. Long (leeves of the fame thin ma- vv '
â  t'erial perfectly (hew their arms even to ca
. their (boulders. Their principal orrjaments
. are chains of pearl, to which they hang tc
. small pieces of gold coin. Thejr eyes are an
i large arid fine : and the -nose, which we at
; term Grecian, usually prevails among them, Wl
as it does indeed among the women of all ed
these islands. Their complexions are natu- fei
1 rally fine, but they spoil them by paint, of
â  which they make abundant use; and they
i disfigure their pretty faces by (having the
. hinder part of the eye-brow, and replacing
; it with a straight line of hair neatly applied c,t .
. with some fort of gum, the brow
r thus continued in a straight andtiarrow' line
1 till it joins the hair tin each fide of the
i face. They arc well made, of the middle
- size, and for the mod part
e they are diftinguiflied tyr nothing so much
e and so universally as by a haughty, difdain
e ful, and supercilious air, with which they
r seem to look down upon all mankind as
, creatures of an inferior nature, bom for
. thefr fer>ice, and doomed to be their (laves ;
ii neither does this peculiarity of countenance 1
- in any degree dimini(k their natural beauty,,
r but rather adds to it that fort of bewitching
n attta&ion which the French call piquant."
e CHINESE IHEOLOGY. a
e The following decree published by the Em-
c peror Ton tthing, who succeeded Kang hi t!
>- in 1702, forms a kind of confeffion of 11
d faith, and a declaration of what he viewed a
it as the religion of his fubjedls. The oc- -b
cafion of its publication is fufficiently ex- <1
o prefled in the preamble.
1- " Some of the principal officers of our
[â¢- provinces hate given a wrong interyiretation j (
jr to the meaning of our orders, transmitted a
y to them, rcfpedling the means of preventing a
>r the damages eccafionfcd in Hie copntry by t
1- deftruitivc infe&J, and have understood them :
1- in a sense quite different from our intention, f
i- | They have erroneoufiy concluded, that I Â»
i- j have fallen into the ridiculous error of those v
g I who believe in the spirits called couei chiw, as \
h if I imagined prayersoffercd up to thsfe pre- L
a- tended beings, could remedy our present as- '
e- fliftioms. My meaning, therefore, is as c
:n follows : r
n, " Between the Tim or Supreme Being and 1
to man there is a relation, a certain and infal- -
:ir lible correspondence, as to what concerns :
fe punifliments and rewards j when our plains i
â¢fs are desolated, either by inundations, drought !
n- or infe&s, what is the cause of our calami- '
~d ties ? They are perhaps occasioned by the '
lc- Emperor bimftlf, who deviates from that 1
nd integrity and justice so ncceflary for good 1
government, and thereby Jays the Tien un- 1
irs der the necessity of employing these pur.iih- 1
an ments to bring him back to a sense of his
bo duty. Perhaps they may be occasioned by
rs, the principal officers of the province, upon
ry which those misfortunes have,fallen, in not
vn consulting the public good, and neglefting
>m to take jultice as the rule of'their condudlâ
icej And may not these calamities be owing to
ed the Governors of cities, who neither aÂ£t
[k> with equity, nor give the people good ex
re, "amples or Suitable inftrudtion ; cr because,
ale in certain provinces and diftrifts they vio
to late the laws, contemn eftablifiied cudoms,
iey and lead difordeily lives ? The heart of man
m- being thus corrupted, that happy union
aid which ought to subsist between him and the
irb Tien, is interrupted and disturbed, and end
en- less misfortunes overtake us ; for, when
or men come (hort of their duty, that benefi
the cent regard which the Tien had for them ;
ofe becomes changed.
;fs, " Convinced of the truth of this infalli
ley lible dodhine, when I am fr,formed, that
ks, some provincefuffers, either by long drought
be or excessive rains, I search my own heart
ieir carefully, examine my pad conduit, and
na- think of reforming those irregularities which
â¢ef. may have crept into my palace. Evening
iefe and morning, and all the day long, do I
ith confine myfelf within the bounds of fear and
the refpcct. I endiavourto give the Tien con
, I vir.cing proofs ot my uprightr.efs and piety,
iin-- in hopes that, by a regular life, I fnall be
lily able to make the Tien change the resolution
Pu- which he hath formed cf-punilhihg us. It
lich is in your power, O ye great officers vyho
ieir govern provinces ! it is in your power to -ai
m ; lift me ; it is in yours, yc people, fcldiers,
nee and others, whatever quality ye be, it is in
her your power to acquit yourselves also of this

ains perfection ; aid artd mutually exhort one a

or- to corre& your repent of your

I canndt too often fepeatr To pre rent ca
lamities, there are no means more certain,
than to keep a ft rift, watch over ouvfeltes,
to live in fear, and to strive for perfeÂ£tion s â
When they tell you to pray and invoke
rits, what do they mean ? It is, at M
only to implore their mediation, to represent
to the Tien the sincerity of our refpectÂ»a))4
the fervour of our desires. To
therefore, in any manner, that ihefe prayert
and these invocations/can remove our cala

our dwn conduct, live not in fear, and have
not our hearts filled with refpe&towards the

to draw Water after having
shut yp its source ; it is omitting the essen
tial part, and attaching ourselves to that
which is rieceffary only. How can you
hope by such a conduft to obtain ac
complishment of your desires.?
" Hear then again, what I think: lam
clearly and fully persuaded, that there iÂ«
between Tien and man, a reciprocal
and a perfeit correspondence. It fs for your
inftru&ion,. O ye great officers, it is for
yoq that I have not difdained'to take up my
pen, and to explain .my thoughts in the
clearest manner I could in order that yon
may conform to the sentiments
which I have expressed, this is the only
cause of the present inftruftions."
The present emperor, who succeeded Yon
tching in 1736, holds the fame sentiments;
and thus this do&rine of the existence and
attribntes of the supreme being, and the 1
worlhip and homage due to him, has subsist
ed in China without change, during a long ""
series of ages.

The following was politely sent in by captain

GRATITUDE TO PATRIOTISM.
Ye Herd ay the citizens of New-York ex
hibited a fpJendid proof of attachment,to
the federal government, by their honorable
reception of 'the President of the United
States. ,
Agreeable tf V rev cap
tain Loyell and Lamb's tr<jpps of horse, pro
ceeded early in the morning to Haerlem
bridge, where they met the President, and
escorted him to town.
On their approach, the several uniformed
cerps formed at the Bull's Head tavern, and
joining the procession, moved forward in the
following order :
Captain. Lovell's troop of horseâcaptain
Lamb's do.âcaptain Duryet's company of
grenadiersâNew-York Rangers, command
ed by lieutenant Laightâband of muficâ
captain Ardent's Independent Rangersâ
captain Hulett's New-York Volunteersâ
captains Richardson and Wolfe's companies
of iufzntryâmilitary officers on horseback
âthe PRESIDENT in his coach and four,
attended by a detachment of the cavalryâ .
citizens in carriages and on horf-back. ~ J
The route was from the Bull's Head thro' ,
Bowery-lane, Chatham-street, Broadwa-,',
Beaver-(lreet, into Broad-ftrcetâThe mili
tary advanced up to Garden-ftrset, wheeled,
and formed a line from Mr. Avery's hotel
to Beaver-ftfCet âThe President then left his .
coach, and walked, uncovered, to his lodg-,
ings at Mr. Avery's, accompanied by gene
rals Morris and Hughes, and a number of ,
other gentlemen of dillinCtion.
While the procession wa3 moving down
Broadway, the bells of Trinity church com
menced ringingâA federal salute was fired
by captain Ten Eyck's company of artillery
from the Battery, and another by the gar.
rifon ill Governor's I (land fort. The Britifli
Frigate Thifbe fired a royal salute, a mark of
attention on the part of captain Hardy,
which reflects great honor oh his character
aÂ»an officer and gentleman..
It is but justice to fay, that the whole
business was conducted by the military in the
molt proper manner ; and that their good or
der, soldierly appearance and behaviour, and
the promptitude and correÂ£tne& with which
they performed the various evolutions, did
thera much credit.
The croud of citizens which attended,
was immense. All appeared equally anxious
to behold the First Magifti'ate of a FREE
PEOPLE Â» and by repeated shouts, an
nounced the general fatisfsftion with one of
their most early, zealou3, tried frienfc, \whofc
past services arc too great, too deeply im
prelled, ever to be forgotten by the existing
generation, or obliterated from the faithful
records of the American revolution.

an ardent attachment to our federal gov

ciferation of a few noisy demagogues may
fay Â»o the contrary, we warmly approve of
your unatnphibiou.s and decided speech at
the opening of the extra fefiion of Coiigrefs ;
as mildly but firmly expressing, in a tligi Â£ d
manner, the just feelings of indignation
which the piratical conduft of the banditti

of every true American. What a trans

BATION to the Chief Magistrate of the
Union. Amidst the various sources from
whence the President received ftiouts of ap
plause, none was more unexpected and pleas
ing than the huzzaing and clapping of hands
from the prisoners, who were on the top
of the j?il. All was joy and exultation from
one end of the city to the otherâbells
ringingâguns firing and clap
ping of handsâEven many honest patriots
who were supposed. inimical to our federal
government, Slid mora, attached to France
than their own country, to their honour be
it spoken, loft fight ps tbeif supposed crimi
nal prejudices, and joined in effufions of
gratitude towards the man who, in so ma
ny trials abroad and at home, has deserved
well of his But while we feel an
exouifite fatisfaftion in making honorable
mention of many-men of this city whom it
was not expedtcd would join even at this
critical moment-in any measures of exulting
spprobation in the reception of a man who
had spoken in such just term 6 of patriotic in
dignation against the French nation for the
insult and injuries offered towards our citi
zens, still there were a few green-eyed mon
ftcrs who could not conceal their inward ,
tortures at feeing the universal enthuiiafm
which pervaded all ranks of people on the
entry cf ;hc virtuous and patriotic Adams
into shis city. How happy is it for Ame
rica, that we still have a President who
dares speak sentiments of independence, and
eomplain of injuries done us, even by the
French RepublicâWhat a different language
woqld have been held forth by Mr. Jefier
fon, had he been President ! We should, my
independent countrymen, have kified the rod
that feourged usâhave/' licked the hand
just raised to fhtd our blood."

notice, that the President has mentioned
Wednesday next ?u the day on whiA it will
be agreeable to him to accept of the enter-

OF PEACE. s*
The present is a moment of anxious expecta
tion. On the ilTue of the negotiation between
Creat-3ri f ain and France," various intcrefts, public
and private, are lufpcndcd. Tho some of opin
ion, that peace between thpfepowfcrs will operate
the United St it?*, a 1 it will leave France at
liberty to chastise, or bring us to her feet, wv
arc of opinion that our em'jarrafTmcnti cannot be
encraafed by the event of peace. The commer
cial interests of Great-Britain, are cflenthlly blen
ded with thole of the United States, and it is not
poflible that lhe could cons. Nt tda facrifice so im
portant, in making a voluntary peace ; and France
knows that any other peace must be delusive and
momentary.
The intereft# of the United States, so far, there
fore, as those of Great-Britain are involved with
will be considered, and prsferved in a peace;
and, this idea extends to those interest in a degree
beyond calculation. Some persons have after ted
that Great-Britain is at so low an ebb that (he

From the XN. T.) Time Pifc's.
Doctor Caid\Veli ofPhilatlclpliia, in
publicly announcing his intention to difeon
tipiie his fn'sfcriotioa to Porcupine's- Ga
zette, appears afliduous to obviate any "eon
jedlure* which might thereby arise of h's "fa
vouring republican principles. He declares
hfrnfelf a zenloifs si : erid to the measures of
the late nail present administration ; and
that at tlie commencement of this moll ob
noxious gazette, it was,in his op'nion, (in
w*.ich, as well as the opinion now entertain
ed of it, all men of fcr.fe and refinement, he
Vays, wil concur with him) " a work of
great public utility, a repository of lifeful
fafls, of valuable principles, and acute and
ingenious speculations, good sense forming,
the body, and energy and correftnefs of
ftik the dress"âthat on account of its re
cent ohange from nfeful and judicious satire,
to low vulgarity and abuse, producing, in
the present calamitous crifi3, mifehiefs never
to be atoned for by any pqffiblc future fcri vi
ces of the Editor, â he has deemed it incum
bent on him no longer to encourage its cir
culation, and profefles hiir.felf ready, when
ever Mr. Porcupine's account againfl him
fliall be exhibited, .to difeharge the fame ct
fight. Most of this Editor's fubferibers, he
observes, are " men of considerable acqpi
fitions in fcicnce, of high refinement in li
terature, } .idges of (entiment, judges of
style, judges of every thing embraced in the
extensive region of talle."âlJe therefore
prsfumes condemn hiin, in his public ca
pacity, for his notorious want of delicacy in
not accommodating his paper to the talieof
his readers. Much fault is found with his
numerous quotations from the True BMton,
a paper, the condu&ors of which he deems
below contempt, wotwithftanding they ad
vocate those principles of order and found
policy which he w/fhes to preserve their as
cendancy in Britain.
If the Doftor has been eoir.njiiTioned by
the fubferibers at large to convey these
tvholefotr.e lefTons nfaothority to. Mr. Por
cupine's ear, it might not have been am:fs
explicitly to have said so ; if not, it may
well be conceived that all he had to do was
to withdraw his own name at discretion, and
leave other fubferibers (particularly those
who are men of tafie and science) to follow
their own inclinations. If Mr. Porcupine
chufes to offend them all, hirafelf, and not
the Dr. will be the fufferer. A friendly
hint 011 this fcrtre (though a liberty which
some men of delicacy wouldhefitatetoaffume)
might possibly have been well received if well
meant ; but for the doftor, without autho
rity, to take upon him the officÂ»of di3ator
general is aristocracy witj) a vengeance; he
might have spared himfeif his extraordinary
pains to repel suspicions of Jacobinism after
this specimen of an opposite temper. When
Mr. Porcupine wishes for advice in hit own
profeffion, he doubtless knows to whom he
is to apply for it : unsolicited counsel
would not, however, appear to less advan
tage in a less diftatorial garb.
But what can have rendered two avowed
ariflocrats so inimical to each other? vAp
pearances fceuv to indicate that the Doftor's
principles extend further than those of his
late colleague. Porcupine is friendly only
to political monopoly; but medical monopoly
(which with the Dr. is equally sacred) has
not yet, it fcetm, been adopted as a
his creed. Porcupine, though a medico-lay
man or swine (the Dr. will furnifh a suitable
term) has ventured publickly to give an p
pinion on a medical fubjett: He has for
oncfiqueftioned the propriety of Hood-letting,
and this ii held up as a crime never to be
expiated. If the one-has no right to haz
ard an opinion for the .good of his fellow
creatures on a medical fubjeft, what right
has the other, for the benefit of his feliow
fubferibers, to interfere in news-paper or
political fufc}eÂ£ts? Neither of them lay claim
to infallibility; neiglvbctur's fare therefore
must reasonably be expected. Porcupine has
not profeffed any knowledge of medicine;
his opinions therefore do not appear in dif
puife: patients of found mind who compare
taem, when accompanied with reasons, with
those of a Physician, will judge for them
selves what weight to attach to each, and if
the u.lfupportcd opinions of one illiterate
person be preferred to those of.abody of the
faculty, it is an evil for which the alflifted
may demand pity, but for which the hon â 
eft enquirer cannot deserve ceafure, Ad
mitting Mr. Porcupine's motives to the be
nevolent, and the contrary ought not light
ly to be presumed, is he not to be commen
ded for his endeavours to prevent the contin
uation of what he really believes to be mis
chievous and fatal ? would fye not be crim
inally remiss in with-holding them? When
his opinions (hall have been experimentally
proved to be erroneous, all men liable to be
atcaeied with the prevailing diftuder will be
gainers by the discovery, and 4/il! become
c6nverts to bleeding when experience fliall
warrant its utility.
Dr. Caldwell contends that negleÂ£l in ti
ling the lancet, or using it with too sparing
a hand, in the early stages of this diieafe,
is proved to be fatal by the frequent and
copious hemorrhages which in this cafe,
and not otherwise, nature too often ineffec
tually throws out for the patient's . relief,
owing to obftru&ions, the removal of which
has been too long delayed, Porcupine's in
famious and criminal paragraphs again ft the
practice, he observes, have, to !As owu
knowledge destroyed the lives of some citizens
three in (lance-, are-adduced where patients,
bow dead, have refufed to undergo the oper
ation, merely from the reading'if them; and
to this refhfal, under the otherwise favoura
ble symptoms of their complaints, he attri
butes their ceaih; every other practicable
means for their reeoveiy having been care
fully and anxioujly tried. So long a3 the
doctor's premised can he maintained, his
conclulio'ns are natural and necessary, but it
be admitted on the other hand that
those who advocate a cqntraiy practice,
would in the cases mentioned, infer that
bleeding would have accelerated the patient;
difoluticft. Eeeaufe the I?j:. thinks proper
to chsVgfe their ctsth to Porcupine, whom
hefcruplis not to arc life of criminÂ»l intc;i
tiou, he /iffres to taKe it fcr granted that
i the latter mult cut his throat in rcmorfe for
his crime, and that this without further ex
amination will effctbnlly phtcethe system
he advocates upon a firm and durable found
aticn. What njptivccan Mr. .Porcupine be
fuppofed-to have for wantonly fporii>.â¢ g with
the live-, of,his fellows? Their deaths can
in no wife bentsCt him: If he does not con
tinue to .recommend a measure after experi-
(hall have proved it to be injurious, a
caution to refrain from a practice the good
effefts of which have, till lately, been ques
tionable even among the faculty (a mere ne
gative provision) is certainly less blameable
than some positive experiments which hare
been made Jjy physicians upon pitfents la
bouring under a new disorder. " Let the *
De-Jii have his due;" though Mr. Porcir
p'inc may aim at the definition of our li
berties, yet this has no connexion with an
aitack upon our lives.
A REPUBLICAN. \
Frcm the (New-Tori) Commercial GazetteÂ»
Among all the writers on the plague which
has ravaged our sea-ports for some years
none appears to have noticed the method of
cure prescribed by Moses, in the 16th chap
ter of Numbers. A plague broke out in tlx:
camp of Israel ; which was then in a coun
try extremely fubjedt, as it is dill, to the
yellow fever, or plague. * The people were
alarmed, and murmured agflinlt Moses and
Aaron. [For the people were grumbleri
then, as they are now, ar.d laid every evil,
mora! and physical, to their rulers. Indeed !
this plague happened jufl after those jacobia
ical fellows, Korah, Dathan and Abiram, i
had been preaching liberty and equality, and i
had been fwalieÂ«,td up alive.]
When Moses discovered the yellow fever
among the Israelites, he directed Aaron " to
take a censer and put fire therein, and put
on incenseâand go to the congregation and ,
make an atonement." Aaron did so, and '
" he flood' between the dead and the firing,
and the plague was flayed."
On firll reading this, one would be resdjf
to call it a miraculous interposition of Provij
dence. But why fnould we resort to such
a conftruition of the passage ? The censer
was filled with incense burning. Now if wÂ«
suppose a single censer only to be used, we
cannot suppose the power of it, either by
agitating the air or diffufing a wholefomi
perfume, to be equal to the effeÂ£t mentisnj
ed,Â»viz. flaying a plague that had carried off
fourteen thotffand. But is it not probable
that vail numbers of confers were used, tho*
the high priefl and his censer are alone men*
tioned ? In the passage which relates to the
affair of Korah, great numbers are mention,
ed, and it is well known how much theyj
were used in the Jewish facrifices.
Combining a little philosophy with the
historical account qf that plague, we may
suppose that Aaron separated the sick and
dead from the well, into a diflant part of ,
the camp, and that he employed burning )
censers to agitate and purify the air. i
It is well known that fire creates a cir
culation of air and though it has been
assertedÂ» that it is hurtful to kindle fires ia
infe&ed places, because they deflroy the
refpjrable qualities of the air, yet this iJ
not true, un[efÂ» in tight vefTtls. It is true
that flame deftfoys air; but it is only that
whifch comes in contact with itâand this
very circumflance is favorable, for by rfli
dering that portion in contaft with it- lighter,'
it rises, and the air bdlow rufr.es in to fill
Up the deserted place. In this way fire
creates perpetual circulation or adtion.
Now by a law of fluids, action ia neceP
fary to keep them pure, that is, all the in
gredients which cornpofe them combined/
By water and air lose their pu
rityâthe parts separate and become un
u-holt some. Stagnant water becomes thick
and ofifenfive ; but we ar: that impure
and putrid water at sea, is cleansed and ren
dered perfectly fit for use, by agitation of
the vessel, or by being pcured from one
calk to Another.
In the fame manner air may be mixed
and purified by action. Fire creates aftion,
and should a city, during a plague, be kept
open, and every houMiolder be compelled
to keep two or three fires, it is extremely
probable that it would have a great effett
in purifying the atmosphere', and arresting
the power of its-contagious influence. '
It .is hot improbable that the aromatics
consumed in the Jewish censers, might be
ufeful in correcting the state of the air.â
Bub the chief effedt Was probably produced
by the aftion given to the air bp the fire and
the motion of the censers.
It ii desirable that we should avail our*
selves of all the scraps of ufeful knowledge
to be collected from ancient hiflory, as well
as modern experiments. Whatever we may
think of that old book, the bible, there is a
vast fund of ufeful faÂ£ts in the Levitical laws;
and particularly uffful for a people in hot
countries. All the washings ana purifica
tions, directed by Moses, had their use ;
and we, when we grow Wife enough not to
despise antiquity, (hall revive the praftice of
many bf the laws of Moses.
The by obeying the regulations
of Moses, escaped the diseases of the cli
mateâBut the modern inhabitants of ~E
gypt, by naglectiagthe fame falutarj* rules,
perish with the plague by thoafands and
millions. And so (hall we in America, uu
lefi we change our habits of living, and our
"mode of build i'-ig cities. .
