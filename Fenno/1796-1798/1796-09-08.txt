A very valuable Merchant Mill,
A DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and funelry STONE
QUARRIES to be let
I will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po
towmac, for any term not less than seven, nor more than
eleven years, from the firft day of September next. The
_ mill-houf â¢is42by 40 feet, three stories high, built with
i stone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two
. overflrot 18 feet wat r wheels, and Evans's machinery
. complete, with every other thing proper and neceflary for
carrying on the business with dispatch. and at as little ex
ptnfc as poflible, all in good order.âFrom the mill to my
landing oÂ» the I'dtbmac river, (wh-recraft, of any bur
'hen mai-deliver grain and take in flour) it is a' out 40
aids, and from thence by water to George Town and
the'Clty of Washington, about X miles, and to Alexan
dria about 11 miles. This S.uation, aided by a fufficient
capital, will command the produce of a very extensive :
' back country, where large quantities of wheat and other
, grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8
to 10 miles less than to any nsatket town up m the navi
, gation of the Potow ac. There are on the premises a
!arge stone CoopeiV ihjp, a stone granary, and aconimo
: dious miller's hoUse At the landing aforefaid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, whfch is in treat for
-1 wardnefs and probabiy will be finifhed the enfif-Ing fall. '
There ate also on the premises, a Brewery and Distille
ry, built with stone, in them are three stills, two coppers
â or boilers, with everv necessary article, all new, and in
gcÂ»d order, and fufficiently large to carry on the Brew
cry and Distillery upon a very extensive plan. This prop
â  erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my laads adjoining the? premises, and along the
banks of the river, wherp craft may lead with ease and dis
patch, is an i nmenfe q iantity of building and iounda
-1 tion-ftones. Four quarries are now open, and as many
more may be opened with ease : the stone taken from these
, quarries is better, and has the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it. I willrent these <piarries
separately or together as may best suit.
On the top of the hill, and about 200 yards from the
mill, is a stone Dwelling-house, large enough for the ac
commodation, of a family : also. a kitchen, dairy, fmohe- ,
houfc, &c. and a garden, enciofed and in cultivation, the ,
foiof which is equal in goodness to any in this -state. I ,
will also rent this property. 1
-1 Adjoining to the Brewery and .Diftilkry is a Smith's
(hop, in which is a complete set of Blatkfmith's tools,
which 1 will aMo rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
tenant two negro blackfmitfcs, one.of them is a complete
workman.
If I rent out the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts,
which were built for the purpafe of carrying stone : they '
will altogether bring upwaras of 90 pcrch Immediate
poffefjiqn will be -given. For terms aijply to the fubkrib-' [
er in this town.
The Mil,!, Brewery and Distillery, with their appurten
ances, .will be delivered to the tenant or tenants in good
repair, and mult be so returned, at'tlie, expiration cf the

From the North-CakouhA Jobrnai. v
KNOWLEDGE is the illumination Â«f 'the 1"
mind. Ignorance is therefore its d.irknefs. This
illumination i 6 made by an object (hiÃing full upon c
the mind. This fnining of the object is the per- r '
ception which the mind has of the objefl. This
perception of thciobjeA is attained by reading ard a
thongbt. Reading and thought are therefore ef. ' l
fenlial to mrntat light. Mental darkn'efs ii direst- c
ly opposite to mental light, an 9is therefore pro- n
dut ed by a negkd of reading and thought. Any ''
man might read and thii k a little, therefore afiy I
man might know a little. Any man might read
and think upon fubjefts this year, which he did rot 0
lad year, therefore any man might Â£now more this ll
year than he did lad year j and consequently, the
reaftm why men will be ignorant, is, they will not
read and think. e
Knowledge is as neceflary to,the mind as lijrht is b
to the body; without light the body Humbles and v
falls upon every thing that lies in the way, so with- c
otlt knowledge the mind is forever blundering apon f
error and falfhood - t
Man la proportion to his knowledge, rifes'in the 8
scale of dignity, and approaches in the
fme proportion Jowards the (late of angels; there- c
fore he finks in proportion to his ignorance, and v
towards the (late of brutes. . c
â  Our knowledge cannot be calculated by the num- <3
ber of book? which we have read, or pofTcfs, but
by the number of our.ideasâif we could count
im;r our ideas as often as we do out buoks, or dol- h
lars, we would generally know Wow much we do 1
know ;â¢ and as generally be furpn'fed that the num 1
ber of our books'ami dollars, is gieat as that of a
our ideas. ' J,
A man never knows*what*he wants, until he '
knows what he has ; fÂ« a man never knows his own
ignorance until he knows his own knowledge j f
therefore every man ought to count his ideas as c
carefully as he does his dollars. t
The way to grow rich, is to be frugal, and in- t
duftiious in the acqaiiition of property, and' care 1
ful in the management of it ; so the way to gain 1
knowledge, is to be carcfid and industrious in get- f
ting and retaining ideas. The farmer or mechanic 1
does and gams something this day which he did not a
do and gain yesterday ; by these means his treasure c
is increased, fcr cents make difmes and cifmes 1
make dollars: so if we every day, gain a diftinft r
thought upon any fubjefl, we shall soon have a *
thought upon every fubjedi. >
iBNEAS. t
MAN is a social creature; his wants render so- '
ciety neceflary, and his d:fpofition prompts him to â 
conned hirafelf with his fellows. In'every society 1
there twill be an oneness ; fur to suppose every in- '
dividual 'unconneftea with the reft, is to suppose C
that there is no society at all. That oneness which '
exists in a society is not personal but political : the C
oneness of a society seems to lie m tjyieJwo things, [
in its objedl, and in its laws. The is the
good of the whole ; the laws are adopted by mu- '
tu?.l consent, and every one pledges himfelf for his C
This political oneness may v<yy well 1
be Compared to that hi the human body. Every Â°
member does its pari for the good of the whole
the body is governef by iiv(linÂ£l and reason. It is
impoflible that inftinS and reason in all the thott
fands of the humaa race, (hould point out the fame
tiling, at the fame time, as being conducive to the
public good j for we find, by daily intercourse with
mankind, that their opinions are nearly as different
as their features ; therefore thp opinion of every
man cannot be received as rules of conduct, by
that community to which he belongs. Hence a
rises the ncceffiiy of legislators to enact laws which
may be binding upon every fuhjedi. In con fe. j
quence of that nataral variety in opinions, and t
pronenefs which is in the mind of man to vice, ex- I
ccutive officers are neceflary in every government
upon earth. .
Thedafign of government, is to produce the in- <
tereft or happiness of the State. Hence we fee i
some beauty and propriety in this paflage of scrip- 1
ture ; " Let every foul be fubjedt to the high pow- 1
erÂ«, for there is no power but of Csd, t' e powers 1
that be are ordained of God." It is not said, let '
every foul be fubjeft to a -monarchy, or aristo-, ;
CftACY, or even to a but to the pow
ers that be, that is, to present exiding govern- 1
ments.
f Sometime* a revolt is neceflary and jufiifiable. 1
Vv hen a government produces more evil than good 1
to the State, and when modest and manly remon
strance? eannot prevail u; -ii the rulers to alter the 1
nattft and operations of government, then a revolt
is neceflary and juftifiable. The necefiity in this
[ cafe is fouuded on the interest of the State; it is
. tfiablc upon this principle, that the present go
c vernment is no government at all. The design of
all government is to secure the iiitereft and 'â  iiappi
nsfs of the people; therefore if a present supposed
government is manifestly evil, and adually deltroys
.the interell and happnlefs of the people, that State
r is at â¢Jiber: j', Ly the law of nature, to declare that
their government, i". ho government, consequently
. .aws made by lttch authoniy, arc not binding, and
difobcJierec is obedience to a higher law, viz. the
law of nature. Hence were I an lrilhman, i
wouli be a Rcrolu itmift. . _ y
In America, we have a demi-arifiocratic demo
cracy. Onr laws arc generally deemed as reafÂ«nab!e,
virtuous and fa'uiary to the nation. They must be
so, notwithlhnding they may oppose the interelt of
a few individuals, if upon principlesof equity they
are calculated to prodoce the good of the nation.
It is Sin obvious fact, that every American enjoys,
or might enjoy, every liberty and privilege which
any citizen in any couutry could reasonably desire.
Our pcifons, property and character are secured
tons hy the laws of the land. No American is
born to power, but mud He chosen by the voice of
the people. Notlyg can be a greacer Itimulous
to virtue and political worth than this. Every man
has the way to great ness and honour before him.
Let him copvince the people that he is a man" of
fuperier talfnts and virtue, and they will confer a
proper dignity upon him From these faÂ£ts I in
fer, that a revolt at this time is u'nneceffary and nn
jultifiable. These things being so, what propriety,
what wisdom is in all thole declamations against 1
government, which from day to day we fee and I
hear,/ Are they not calculated to sow the feeds cf â 
discontent, the foundation of every political mis- '
chief? If we suppose 'the measures of government '
to be wrong, would it not be more wife, more mo
deft, and more manly to petition "for a revifal, or 1
alteration, than to cry out, " our liberty isloling or 1
loft. Gill the deception of Congress! the trea
chery, the fpecujation, the Britairiifm of our great 1
men I This man is an aristocrat, that a demagogue ; f
down with them! they ought never to govern the* '
Americans again," t t
Such exclamations as these are the native effufi- 1
onsof a mind maddened by disappointment or in- e
tereft, ignorance or pride; sure they cannot .be the '
dilates of sober sense, c
lam very far from thinking that every declaim- c
er againfl government is ienl(mentally opposed to I
her measures : But some artful men have seen the '
way-to popularity in a government like ours ; they c
ciitd out against prcfent measures, and endeavour- 1
ed to peri'uade the people that all was not right ; Â£
the next step was to iufiauati themselves into the 1
good opinion of the people, then their'eledtion was 1
sure. Others have seen how happily they have fue
ceeded, and To follow on. Others again-rail at go- 2
vernment itift feecanfe they dare to do it ; and be- !
cause it is agreeable =io those to whom they are *
dupes. 1
For my own part, when I fee a man genteely :
dressed, with the constitution or a newspaper in his I
hand, haranguing his rieighbouts, or a croud, upon '
the follies, or x vices of government, I cannot help '
thinking he will be a candidate at our next eledtion, '
and that his condutt speaks this langnage, p'eafe to I
fend me, and I will do your bufineft much bitter than 1
those "villains now in ojficc. I
The very circumstance ef allowing ourselves to '
speak against government, ha* a tendency to bend '
our minds that way ; and it may fee very probable
that many who began without now continue 1
their oppwfition from a fixed belief that they are '
right': "but it would, no doubt, be very ungenerous 1
to fay, lhatjevery one who is oppoftd to the mea
sures of has formed his ftntiiMentsTn 1
this wayâdifference's in political opinions, may 1
arise upon the fame renera! principles, that they do
on other fuhjcÂ£U, from the native difference in the 1
minds of men, and from the different books they
read or different company they keep. Different ;
sentiments may be of essential service rn politics, as
well as in religion : They will expose every
to a full difcufCon, and thus more accurately difco
verthe truth, than if there had beea no oppofitioi)-
But one thing is certain, that men of principle are
generally men of moderation and candour there
is something in a consciousness of innoccncy, which
â gives sobriety and dignity to what a man fays and
docsâit does not need those other aids, which are
nfceflarily employed by those who are hurried on by '
disappointment, interefl and paflion ; men of prin
ciple will at lealt suppose it possible that they may
be mi (taken, and therefore cannot feel a disposition ]
to palm their opinionÂ® by any unjust measures.' Mo
deration, modesty, and a spirit of honest inveftig'a- 1
tiÂ°n become man, who is born like the wild ass's
colt, and arrives to eminence, and knowledge, and
virtue by flow degrees. Therefore if we do not
fully approve the measures of government, let us re.
monftrate with vvifdom and prudence, and remem
ber that the powers that be, are ordained of GOD
âand as long as we have such a government, as
and enemies acknowledge, let- us be abedient
for conscience fake. iENEASâ

The disorder called St. 'Anthony's fire is very

ted fatally, by bringing on a brain fever, that very
shortly puts an end to the patient's existence.
A fubjeft of great importance to the commerci
al world is likely soon to find its way into the
court of king's bench. The silks on board the
Mediterranean fieet, captured lad winter, by admi
â  ral Richery, ?nd carrisd into Cadia, were preten
ded to be, or were brought by a Spanish company,
l at the head of which was the marquis d'lranda.
These silks have never been regularly condemned as

. London, conttary to the a& of navigation. A
. Ihip, kden with some of these silks, and valued at
120jQ00l. (terling, is arrived in the river from Ca

1 in Old Bond-street. The underwriters who have
. paid losses formeily on these very silks, itave petiti

In a diR-uffion upon 1 Com. insult which several
members of the c uncll of .Five Hundred experi
. 'enced, Taliien-, no. cooienwd with ths inveighing
, againtt the particular aft from which it arose,
â  launched out into general reflexions upgn the di
r reAory, affe&ed to consider this insult as a more
â  dangerous conspiracy against the Nation .1 Repre
feiitatives than that lately discovered, and lamented
i the progrcfs of what he termed a rc-attion ; by
1 which he meant that the government had for some
, time pad, in the disposal of places and the encou
[ ragcment oÂ£ individuals, discovered a strong partial
i ity for the caufeof royalty.
F Tne appearance, the language, the late conduct Â«
i of Taliien produced a general expression of indigo
, nation in 'he council, more vehe.nent than dece
rous. Thibaudeau, a member of great charadter,
in an eloquent and energetic speech, cxpofed the
infidiouc declamations of Taliien. He displayed
. the indefatigable adlivity, the different Ihapes, the
varying conduit and language ot the party of 1 er
ror, and their refllefs artifices to acquire power ;
he recalled the maflacrees of September and 31ft
May; the connection of the partizans of Terror
with the late conspiracy; and in fine, the true re.
adlion, which he said, proceeded from this detcila*
ble and sanguine fadtion.
The sentiments of the council seemed almost
unanimous in favour of the jiropolition supported
by Thibaudeau, afid the sentiments he exprefled.
The charadter of Taliien appears to be perfectly
underltood, and to be completely detested. The
temporary reputation acquired by this changing po
. litician has been unable to efface the genial charac
ter and impttlTion of his life and of his conduct.
Difappoimed, perhaps, in his_ expectations of pow
er and influence under the new cOnllituticn, he may
have been induced to abet, or at least to wish suc
cess to the views of the Jacobins, and the authors
of the late confpiracv. His language feeir.s to sup
port this conjedlure. If these be'his withes, and if
he spoke as the organ of the remnant of the fyltem
of Terror, the spirit and indignation displayed by
the council of Five Hundred would infer, that the
adherents of this fyltem are few, and that apiong
the'refpe&ible part of the aflerftbly none were found
to lilteo with approbation to his declamation.
But if the enemies of the present conditutiqn,
and the authors of the late conspiracy, expedt fup
ptirt from some mefnbers of the legislature, the pre- >
fervation of tranquility will depend in a great mea
sure upon the vigilance of the Directory, and the
adtivity and vigor with which they employ thÂ«
power which they pofiefs* That they will bring
into adtion, there can belittle doubt. Their am
bition will rally' 011 the fide of their virtue. They *
will exert the abilities which they unqueflionably
pofTefs in the maintenance of order, and of that con
stitution whii h secures their own power. They vyill
be seconded by the virtuous parts of the iegfflative
bodies. At prffent, the great majority in both
houfrs, seem cordially to co operate with shem.
1 he French naiion has fuffered too much for the
revival of the system of terror.' 'They know its
leaders too well to entrnll thetfi confidence 01 pow- .
er. TheLulk of the people are pleased with a go
vernment, which, combi ing the vigour of a raon
aicliy wiilntie for mi of a republic, likt' TliTtercd Â»
their national pride by a/eries of fp'endkl and un
rivalled success. From thefc causes, if the event*
to France did not set all coojedlure at defiance, we
(houtd be inclined to fpe:ulate in favour of tranqui
lity, and to conclude, that Parir will not be the
scene of those ludden and rapid revolutions, by
which it has been so much harrafled and disgraced.
