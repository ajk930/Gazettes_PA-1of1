From 'ht Farmer's Weekly Museum.
" And fad v 'font appeared unto them with
heavy countenances."
With the punctuality of a merchant, I
ihall now perform the prorraifc ir. my
'all speculation I then took occasion to
, review and to reprove the fantaftic romances
of the eighteenth century. To shew f -me
of their operations upon nervous, timid,
and indeed upon all exquisitely organized
systems, {hall be the business of this sermon.
Jn my digreflive manner, a few topics,
slightly conne&ed with the main defig-n,
will be darted ; and may possibly add to the
amusement of the reader, though they will
hardly improve his logic.
If, ns the farmers fay, "mv memory
serves me." Dr. Beattie his somewhere
cautioned yovtthful readers of fenfibiiity to
beware of immodrately indulging in the
pcrufal of such works as the Night Thoughts
<jf Yot'NS. Thia judicious Scotchman as
signs an excellent reason for his rule. For
he adJs that books, which present sometimes
falfe, and always gloomv views of life, and
which wear ontthe mind by a i onftant fuc-
Ccffion of h'Trors must ultimately prove per
nicious. For terrific and mournful images
are from their very nature striking, and to
men of strong farcyj easily adherer,t. Hence,
in timeÂ® of grief and sickness, and even a
inid the common calamities and cares of life,
such images will rife and, in " a long, un
broken, funeral tra n," will continually pass
before our diftradled eyes. One of the most
ufeful and necessary of our virtues is Forti
tude ; a Companion, in the season of distress,
absolutely necessary to enable the fretful im
patience of our nature to tolerate its woes
But when, from our habits of reading and
' thinking, fpp&res, demons, melancholy,
sorrow, black cares and " fights unholy,"
are present with us, Fortitude flies away.
We mistake the phantoms of imagination
for the ills of life. The poison of romance
tijia every arrow from the quiver of fate';
and we fall viftims not so much to the fever
in our veins, or to the poverty of our coff
â¢ ers, as to the despondency of our thoughts,
and lo the 'â¢ giant of Despair "
In the works of Mrs. Radcliffe, and
of all her imitators, mournful or horrible
description predominates. The authors go
â¢ out of the walks of nature, to snd some
.dreadful incident. Appalling noises must
be created. Ghosts must be manufaftured
by dozens. A door is good for nothing, in
the opinion of a romance writer, unless it
creak. The value of a room is much en
-1 hanced by a few dismal groans. A chest
full of human bones is twice as valuible as
a calfcet of diamonds. Every grove must
haw its quiet t-ifturbed, by the devil in some
fh pe or other. Not a bit of tapestry but
â¢ must conceal a corpse ; not an oak can grow
without flickering banditti. Now, in real
.life, examined ia any age, or in any coun
try, we cannot find such a series, such a
combination of horrible events, as the ro
â¢ mance writers display in almost every page.
AH their knights ate knights of the doleful
Countenance. Fortunately for mortals,
though there is much misfortune, and much
evil here, yet every objeft is not covered with
a pall. There are cbjefts less fable to our
eyes than the coffin. It is misrepresentation
to state the whole world resembles Bun Van's
'valley of the shadow of death. It is mis
chievous to exhibit such a falfe picture, It
enfeebles the mind. It, induces a habit of
melancholyit strengthens frantic fear, a
. passion remarkable, according to Collins,
for beholding " appalled the unreal scene "
Instead of 'hus wantonly weakening the
mind by Â«iij-eÂ£ting its attention toghalliy il
lusions, to 'horrible (hadows," and " un
.real mockery," we should adopt the disci
pline of the poet,
" That superstition mayn't <rrcate
" And club it* ills with those of fate,
M I many a notion take to talk
44 Made dreadful by its vizor mafic,
" Since optic reason (hewsme flaiu,
M I dreaded sPECTRf.s of the bkain."
If I had a friend of exquisite fenfibiiity,
whose irritated nerves vibrated like the
chords of music, I would lock up Mr;Â»
RadclifPs novels.from his morbid curiosity.
I would not fuffer him tef'turn pale at the
thoughts of any of her ghosts. He should
â¢" laugh and (hake in Rabelais' easy chair."
He fliiuld not walk in any of her galleries,
"nor abide in any of her courts. I would
address him, in the words of the sensible
Greek,
" Love not so much the doleful knell,
" And news the boding night birds tell;
" Nor in imprefl: remembrance keep
" Grim tap'Ory figures wrowght in flcep;
" Nor rife to fse in antique hall
" The MOONLIOHT MONSTtRS ON THI WALL,
" And {hadowy ipeilres darkly pass.
" Trailing their fables o'er the grass."
A hypochondriac would be as much in
jured bv the gerufal of the woful romance,
as by a denial of air and exercise. He
would fancy like Don Quixote, that his
iick chamber was a castle. He would mif
wke his nurse for a witch; and call h s
apothecary " Mentoni.' He would con
ver his phials into " vials of wrath" and
poison, and insist that h s pill box was made
of " gloomy pine" or " black larch wood."

BOSTON, Sept. 15.
From GIBRALTAR.
The American Consul at the Havannab,
has purchased of the Spanish government,
on account of the United States, an 18 gun
(hip, with brass artillery. â¢ She is to be
commanded by capt. Preble, and manned
from the American (hipping there. â¢
Capt. Johnson, from Gibraltar, left there
the 26 July. At that time no accounts of
any aftion between Nelson and Buonaparte
had been received; nor where the fleets
were. The French frigate captwred was
cohjeftured to be n'orth 2,000.000. She
has been manned with prime faiiors, arid
sent to England.
French gasconade was never more con
spicuous, ihan in (he bombastic accounts
they have giver, of the capture of the little
ijland of Malta, by Buonaparte's army, af<
lifted by a large fqnadron of (hips. The
fores of the " Terrible Republic," directed
by one of its most victorious Generals, era
played in the conquest of a " Lodge of Free
Masons It is rather lingular, th3t the
pretence of Buonaparte for his ffault on the
unprepared, and unfufpe&ing Maltese,
Ihould be a want of water for the fleet, when
it is certain, that he had not been at sea
twenty days, and had been into Corsica dur
ing that time. But with Frenchmen, pre
texts are easily found or forged.
MALTA.
The French make merry at the conquest
of Malta. It must be remembered that
Malta was a neutral power ; âthat it had
never joined the combined powers, in repell
ing the French ; and, of course, that the at
tack lately made by Buonaparte on it, adds
another violation of the sacred law of na
tions, another inltanceot mercenary violence,
and diabolic ambition, to that black cata
logue of French wickedness, which would
call a (hade over tjie regisr.g of Erebus and
Night. We know net what gov -mment
will be established in Malta ; but we know
the old one, whatever it may be, will be
overturned. The Demon of degenerate
Democracy having great power is riding on
the "wings of the wind ; and a celebrated
French writer, has predicted, that "De
mocracy will devour Europe, and having
nothing tilfe to feed on will devour itfelf."
We trust enough of Europe has already been
destroyed ; and hope the latier part of the
prophecy will fooii be fulfilled.

The Decade, a French 44 gun (hip, which
trar.fported a number of Frenchmen to

of her, will be given to the Secretary of the

By this correft ftaremer.t it will ap
pear, though the nurfiber of cases has in
creased, that the malignancy of the fever
is much abated. The chance of recovery
of those takÂ«n nour is three times as great
as when the diftafe was firft engendered.
Capta'R Robert Burnes, informs, that
he was cap<ured by the French privateer
Vulture, of Bourdeaux, and detained on
board several monlh>, during which time
the Vulture captured several vessels, three
of which were burnt; among the captured
was the Peggy, of N- York ; this (hip-had

There tveie 13 Spanish (hips of war lying

arrival in port, gave a federal and truly joy
ful salute. Much anxiety had been euter
tained for the fafety of ihe property now
arrived, as the French pirate boats had been
a long time waiting at the Havannah for
its failing, to take it under convoy to a
French port, but they at length found that
they would have too many guns to encoun

HEALTH-OFFICE,

yELtow-.ciTiziNs,
OUR address of the iftinft was m
tendid to prefect to yo,ur view the deplora
ble state of our city.* and to excite into ac
tive exertion the philai thrcpy and benevo
lence so eminently chara&eriftic of the cm
' xens of Pennfylvanfa. The fame generous
sentiments which you have difplaytdhas in
fluenced the worthy ar.d benevolertt citizens
of Bak rnore ; who always alive to the feel
ings of humanity, have, it app ars bythe
public papers, agreed to a fubfeription for
the relief of our <jillreiTed fellow citizens.
We return them all the gratitude and ref
pe& to which dispositions so amiable are
entitled but it becomes our duty public
jy to fta'e that a fund has been provided for
the purpose, upon the principal.of a loan
in anticipation of the liberality and justice
of our Legsflature, which precludes the
necessity of donations in money from the
humane citizens of our filter states.âCon
tributions of provisions from our fellow-ci
tizens in the country, as well in New Jersey
as in our own State, have been forwarded
for the use of the distressed, with a liberali
ty which docS honor to the donors.
We flatter ourselves that similar donations
will be continued by those generous indivi
duals, who are contiguous to. the city, and
can with convenience spare a part of their
produce for the relief of fufferng humanity.
By order of the Board of Managers.
Wm. JONES, President.

New Encampment..
The Committee who superintend the en
campment at Matter's place near the Mill
Pond on the Gerfnantown Road, about
two miles from the city, refpeftfully inform
their countr* friends that they stand in need
of an immediate supply of vegetables and
straw forth; use of those diltrefied citizens
who are flying from the present calamity.
The committee flatter themselves that the
iame liberality will be found in the farmer,
and others, to supply this Encampment, as
hasbeen tot hat on the Cemmon s nearSchuyl
