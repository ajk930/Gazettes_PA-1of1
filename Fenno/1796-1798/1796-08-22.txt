On Tuesday advlÂ»e was received at Calais from ries
Paris, that preliminaries nf peace between the in tl
Court of Vienna and, the French Republic had
been figred ; and in confluence of which intelli
gence, there were great rejoicings in every town and
from Paris to Calais. Abi
in confirmation of this intelligence, L'Eclair amc
of the 19th in ft. has the following paragraph, tin- er !
der the head Paris : to h
" The report that preliminaries of peace with mer
Aliftria are signed was spread yesterday evening left
"throughout all Paris, and is repeated this day.â (hip
We are affiled it is at Basle that they have been for
executed, and that the Dire&oty accepted them
the night before lall. If this news be true, there and
will immediately be something official on this froi
head." '
Thus, then," a war which is said to have been and
undertaken by some of the continental powers for am'
â¢ the purpufe of dismembering France, is likely to cefi
terminate in fevering from the Empire large and wei
fruitful provinces ; for it may ealilv be forefeen,
that the French government will adhere to its fyf- to
tea of making the Rhine the boundary of France, qui
and that it will not be possible to obftruft the exe- mo
cution of this plan. ner
Whether, deserted as we are I Â« our allies, and ver
every other circumstance considered, the British am
cabinet will deem it expedient or fafe to continue
the war singly against Fiance, a (hort time mull Ox
discover. It is evidently the opinion of the monied Be
men in the city, that it will not ; for on the ground
of the emperor's pacific disposition, stocks have St.
experienced a considerable rife. re P
Yesterday arrived Paris Journals to the very late dai
date of the 19th inft, inclusive.
According to the accounts detailed, very much da;
at length, in these papers, it appears, that the ore
carfer'of the French is not lets fuccefsful on the th<
Rhine than it has been in Italy. The French, wi
however, are so much in the aft of exaggeration of
the jofles of the enemy, aDd mean suppression of 011
those sustained by themselves, that we know not po
what degree of credit to attach to their details ; ga
though the success of their operations seems un
doubted. They give accounts of a battle at Al- ha
, tenkirchen, on the sth, in which they took 3,700 13
prisoners, five pair of colours, nine pieces of can
non, and two general officers ; and estimate' the C!
loss at 1,500 on both fides. At Berckenfelt and M
Oberftein, the Auftrians were compelled to retreat of
to Bingen, on the heights of which the French D
state that their armies have taken an advantageous nr
position At Nieder-Lahnftein, Pfoftendorf and ra
Hercheim, other a&ions took place; in which the
Auftrians are dated to have loft 500 priffcners, and ti<
23 pieces of cannon. Jourdan, it is added, has 3'
passed the Rhine, with his principal forces, in the
environs of Audernach, Coblentz, and Neuftadt: in
at which latter place he has fixed his head-quarters, m
Milan makes a moie formidable resistance than S
could be expected. The fortrefs is garrisoned by
Gen. de Sales, with 4000 men. He is inverted by fp
12,000 French ; but his reply to the summons is, pi
that while hs has a man remaining he wi}l r.ot fur- at
render. The French were prepared to give the at
aSiult at the latter end of May.
Beaulieu, reinforced, has taken a strong position p;
with 14,000 men, that covers Lake de Garde and V
enables him to fuccotir.Mantua. al
Mantua is garrisoned by 10,000 men, amply
provided with necessaries. At Trent and Roveredo
there is an immense quantity of horses and bag- 1
gage, which are to be Â£ent into the interior. The ii
monied men coine forward very liberally to defray J
the expence. tl

contains forms a vojumc.

A letter from Madrid, dated April 26, fays,â J

ceials, to digelt a new plan and regulation for this g
army. We understand, likewise, that in three de- t
partmenls of the Marine, Cadiz, Ferrol, and Car- t
thagena, they have put in requisition thcfailors of v
the neighbouring ports, and that they are equipping
(heir belt (hips. Troops are continued to be sent f
to Cadiz, who gofrom thence to reinforce the camp '
of St. Roch. All those difpolitions seem to an- v
nounce a profpeft of war." c
The Spaniards have five millions sterling coming I

k, | DEFEAT OF THE FRENCH f)N THE RHINE.
j We early morning; received Paris Journals to
â ; the 22d inft iuclufive. From gen. Jo.urdan's letter, it
! appeals that the French hive been defeated on the right
l^e " bank of the Rhine by the archduke Charles. Itiscer
ed, tainly not to be expecied that a French general will give
a faithful account of 'the disasters experienced by his
46 own army ; but still there is fufficient :n the letter of
on Jourdan to warrant a conclusion that the defeat which
he luftained has been of some magnitude. This indeed
is evident from the avowed conjequences of the action ;
t " e Jourdan having heen reduced to the necefiity of re
ely crossing the Rhine with precepjtition, and Iv eberwho
had rapfdly advanced to the banks of the Nahe, having
3â been compelled to fall back to the Sieg.
the It (hould not escape our readers notice, that in a for
|.,u mer campaign the Sieg and the Lahn were the places
f 1 that the Republican army met with a severe check.
The retreat of General Wm mfer, and of the Arch
â jU" duke, from Hundfruck, it now appears, were ftilful
the manoeuvres to enable them to attack the French, on
the right bank of the Rhine, with more advantage.

JtfEW-YORK, August 19.
We learn from St. Bartholemetvs, by a vessel
arrived oil Monday, that the inhabitants of Bcrbice
and Demarara invited the Engli(h to take pofleffion
' ,0 of tht.le places, which will bring down the venge
iat ance of France and Holland; and it is fuppoicd
that their property will be entirely confifcated. St.
a '~ Vincents is peaceable, except to a few Chanbs in
the mountains : Grenada is also placed in a m re
" as agreeable situation than formerly; their fate, how
,ur ever, depends a good deal on the situation of St, '
P' - Lucia, and that island is not so effeaually reduced
ar as to place it out of danger. At lead 2,000 men
are concealed in the mountains, and will soon be
~' n " troublesome to the captors again. The inhabitants
on ' of the otbet English islands are revived a little, in
a^. s consequence of the reinforcement under Aber*
" a crombie ; but they are now reduced to half their ,
as " number. A reinforcement from Prefqu'-ifle had
arrived at St. Kitts, of about 600 men. An at-
CS- tack, it was supposed, was intended *jainft 'Statla
let ' and St. Martins ; but if they can protett these ill
ands, it will be well; as Hugues ha? been very
quirt this fame time, waiting for a lurch. Great
avc praise Is given Mr. Murlet, Commissary of St. Eu
nJ" tlatia, for his humane condudt to the inhabitants of
ave that iflandiâone of the firft traits of a distinguished
ae ' and brave officer.
te ' Capt. Bunker, who arrived here on Tuesday,
informs, that the French frigate La Peufee, re
na" ported some days ago to have been in adtion with
two English frigates or sloops of war, is since prov.
~ ed to have been an aition near Montfcrat with the
r. English frigate Beaulieu, Capt. Laforey, of 44.
