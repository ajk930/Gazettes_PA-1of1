1 nÂ® a \ f ' r Â° U an acrount Â» my dear comrade, in

Cf c Â°mnjahd liad marched to the position be
-- tween Bortz aud the Chateau of Uenfbcrg, roak
-9t mg a diitaoce of s even great leagues. Oh the fame

1, uciripi&ea, one in the environs of th:
r- other on the archer, between TrofTdorff ar.d Omar
it âa few of our men were wou.itled.
e 'be 'jth (June 1) at four in the morn- Â»
â¢ng, the army proccfdcd iii two columns. The
3 u j ance ' f guard> commanc led by General Leftbvre,
1- had order* to force the pifTage of the Arher in .
, rout of rYofTdorff, at Ohmar, and at Lunarth ;
e to carry Seigbcrg, and immediately after to pro
ceed up the righi bank of the Seig, and post tt'felf
1 neai Happenchofs, so as to be enabled, on the so!-
owing day, t G cro ss the Sei)J, above Blakenhurg,,
to attack in the rear the position of Ukareth, in
cafe the enemy fliould maintain themselves ihert.
- T lie second divifioii, commanded by General Co.
: 'aud, had 01 ders to force the paiTage of the Sieg
on the two points of Mtindorff ar.d Menden, to
proceed up the left bank of that river, and to post
' before BurfdofF. The enemy occupied both
tie Acherand the Sie ', where ti.ey were flrongly
entrenched. About i.Tne o'clockKu the morning,
t e two divisions, being at Ihe points agreed on,
commeijted the attack with impctuf/ity, forced the
paflage >, and t:rove the "nemy every where from
their entrenchments. A part of General Lefefc.
*re s advanced guatd charged the enemy to the very
ga /r*irÂ° f er g> and imme â  iately after took
pcliefTion of she city, and of the bridge on the
although defemkd by artillery.
The second division, commanded by Geniiai
t-olaud, divided the corps which the Sieg,
and drove a pait of those tioops towards the Rhine
âbut as there was a warm tanonadeon the line of
â¢ li; gberg, the General proceeded, conformably to
" 8 " r(^ er *Â» from Hufe towari-'s Buifdurff, f(>r the
purpok- of the advanced guard of Ge

iÂ»g two batta' âi 8 to watch the motions of the
ma,l body of ihe enemy he left in the rcsr, and f
p.". no; 3c!,;y to vetrcqt, by the rclite of the

1 Â» a t General Coiatid's division was .advancing fullf j- s I tiered G-neral Lefcbvre's cavalry, com- tilfi
inlLii bv Unim] Hjutpole, to cross tlie Sieg aÂ» at
iccr i!v ;ts pyffiMe, for the puipofe of pursuing No
tbe'fcnemy. To this cavalry, ihat of General Co- the
land's division, at the head of which were the A - 'he
' -'! s * Ney and Ormancey, was ir.ftantly of
united. They advanced, qnd every where the Au du<
drian cavalry,, although far superior in number, '"d
yielded the ground. It was now that tKe firtt re- t' ,t;
giment of Chzffears, commanded by the clii.-f of t! > e
squadron, Richepanfe, came up with a part of Au
1 thnn opposite HenefF; anJ, having reached this 3,18
village, he oidered his troops to charge, and made ; Â°Pl
a horrible carnage. This commander displayed On j te "
the occa&on proofs of the utmoil cooluefa in the
â¢ midftof dangers, and of an intrepid boldness. In bre
pursuing the cavalry, he fell on a post of infantry, , anc l
when he Ynade his chafleurs halt, ordered a hedge- |
fire to be kept up ; and, in chafing the enemy, con- Te
trived also to overcQme the obllacle which was i es
thrown in the way ot his pnrfiut. At length the j 8 e Â®
Auftrians, every where defeated, retreated with ]
precipitation, and threw themselves into the ft* ' rar ]
midable post ,of Alkareth. A forced march and P u '
four hours-fighting, would not admit of any far- P re
|her pursuit, and more particularly as this post, cai
impregnable in front, required great circuits to t ' le
turn it in its flanks. Thus the infaniry of Gene ;we
ral Lefebvre's advanced guard continued its march W
towards the right bank of the Sieg, paded the an
night in 'the pofl of Happenfehofs, and General are
CÂ»laudÂ« division on the heights before Bafdorff.â j
It unqtieftionably does not belong to me, to bellow Sa
priifes on these Generals, my fellow labourers }
but it would be difficult for me not to expref* the
f.itisfaftion I felt at feeijig the zeal and aflivity of P n
>jach of then, the unity of the operations with lor
which they were chatged, and the ardour which
prevailed -in their tefpe&ive columns, even in the co
Â«>idft of a&ion.âThe officers of the ftaff equally T"*
distinguished themselves. They every where fur ln i
nilhed an example t'o the troops. Citizen Viron,
second to Adjutant-General Cayla, with' a very j"'
final! force, made the whole post of Ohmar pri- ,n
foners. F'
" Citizen Bevalet, second to Adjutant General 00
Ney, by a charge purpofclv executed, protected "V
the crofling of the Sieg, effe&ed by General Loitge an
at Menden. His hat was (hot thiough in several
places. Beurmann, my aid-de-campi received a
SabiÂ£ wound on the wjift, but killed the soldier ' ei
from whom he received it. Augulle Demas, a- .
nother oPmy ?ids-de camp, had his horfo woundei.' "P 1
The light-artillery was managed in the usual way,
withboldnefs and intelligence,; its ba'.teriei, con
stantly well diredted, and served with the utmoil ce- z '
lerity, did a great deal of mifohief to the enemy.

'â¢ I gave you an account,, my dear comiaie, in c<

Gen. Cotaud on the heights of HenefF. Thus, w
with a view to attack the enemy in flank and rear, ti
Gen. Lifebvre reueived orders to cross the Sieg a- si
bore Blankenberg, and Gen. Colaud to proceed ti
towards Jungrath, to reach from thence he high- c
way by a ctofs march, leaving, however, a fevr bat tl
taliohsat Wtyth, and a few pods of infrfniry and r
cavalry blended along thÂ» ravine to the heights of u
that village. These extreme
ly difficult, on account of the very bad (late of the a
roads, were perfectly well executed.. At four in 2
1 the afternoon the columns were Rationed al{noft at
the fame time by the right and left, on the heights f
behind Alkareth ; and certahily, if the enemy had c
deteimined to continue in their post, not one of a
them would have escaped ; but, being apprized of c
our movements by their hussars, they soon became t
acquainted with our manoeuvres, and retreated to a
Altenkirchen, contenting themfelvci with leaving, t
on.the heights behind Alkareth, two orthtee fqua
drons to protedt their retreat. The two divisions )
accordingly eftablifhcd themselves, three quart
ters of a leagttefrcm Alkareth, in a very advanta- '
geous politioil. Since their departure from the 1
V/ipper, the troops have done nothiog but march t

y It was last night reported, (on what authority â¢'
i, we do not learn, that the Austrian army having re- a!
r, treated to the river Lahn, received there very con- p
i- fiderable reinforcemenis, with which they, in their n
si turn, attacked General Kleber, and succeeded in
1- completely routing hi* forces, having killed several (
t thouiand men, and taken 17 pieces of cannon. Our a
id reader* will, of course, consider this merely as an "
>f unattlhenticated rumour. ' t d
Â»- The following is given, in the last Pari* papers t
ie as the content* of a letter from Frankfort, of May t
in 20thV
at " The Austrian* have formed an inundation, of
ti several leagues in extent, before Manheim. The j (
id caulew.ays which lead from Spites, Deux-Po nts, e
jf and Worms, are the only ones which are not cover- l
of ed with water : it is difficult to conceive any thing
ie more stupid ; for, in cafe of a retreat, there will be f
to a dreadful confufion, a complete difoade: ; the men I
g, mud throw down their arms, or be drowned,
a " We must believe that the Austrian Gtnerals Â£
ns a*e not very strongly persuaded that they will fuc
ir- ceed, since the whole baggage of the army hns
a- been sent to the rear. It i* almoll the general opi- t
he nion here, that the Auftrians will be forced, after :
ch the loss of the fit ft battle, to retreat to Bohemia; <
the inhabitants have, in consequence, thiough feai t
of being pillaged by the retreating at my, provided
themselves with muskets for their own defence. <
" It isimpoffible tÂ» describe the discouragement s
k, which prevails among the Aullihtu tioops. When i
a the three battalions of Walloon grenadiers received
o- orders to march from'this place, on the 14)1 in- ]
i* slant, to Mentz, death and despair were painted (. 1 <
d- the countenances of all the officers, the f , Hers could
lit with difficulty be assembled ; the officers were obli i
ged to hunt after them in the houses where they (
uk were qaartered ; many of them threw themselves I
rat on the ground, refufing to march, and declaring 1
ng :hat they would rather be killed on the fp >t, than ;
ih go to be butchered. The men's mind were so
much irritated, that the officers durfl not have re ;
course to rigorous measures ; and it was only by ,
dint of felicitation and ireaty, that they at length ,
30 prevailed on them to march.*'
