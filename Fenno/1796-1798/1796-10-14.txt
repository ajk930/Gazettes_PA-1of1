id- lilies as a good moral philosopher, would be velua

" Our advanced guard had likewise been repulsed j
but the corps of reserve arrived, and, on receiving
ioilrudtions, renewed the battle.
" The enemy's chief effort was dirÂ«Â£led against
OBf right. General St, Cyrdefended his position
with tne utmost bravery, although attacked by a
great superiority of force. -
" The right of the left wing was likewile at

Thf two armies, after an obstinate contest, which
Ji'led feveriteeii hotir9, remained inadHvethe whole
on the field of battle, and at day break the
' enemy retreated.
"The success of an attack wascertain, but our
convoys of ammunition halting on account of the
retreat ef the head-quarters, precluded uÂ« from the j
pofftblity of hazarding a battle, which for want of
catouches, we coqld not have, supported above
two hours; belides it was rfeceffaty that our flankers
should fall into their position on the right. The
cneipy's advanced guard was stationed in the most
judicious manner. If they had re-tained the po
fition which they had occupied the preceding e
veiling, I should have attacked them tb day, kut
retired behind the Vernitz, and are about to
pafsthe Danube. Our light troops are in pujrfuit
of tbera ; they have already reached Nordluigen.
The whole army will immediately follow them.
" I dispatch a courier without delay, convinced
that the enemy having been close in our tear, an a

vi&ory makes them forget their excessive labours.
The enemy estimate their loss in these conflidts at
7,000 men killed or taken prisoners.
" I have this instant received a dispatch from
gen. Ferino, who announces the arrival of our
tioops at Bergent, where they took several mÂ»rtars,
S howitzer, four culverines, and 22 pieces of can
non, between jo and 40 large barges, and about
t 40,000 sacks of oats, barley and .ftour.
I am almost exhausted for want of- sleep and
from incefiant fatigue. We have just received the
grateful intelligence of an important victory gained
by the army of Italy. . , j
