that be had been initiated in the conspiracy for up- er
wards of a month pad ; he then cxcufes himfelf Â°
for not hating made the discovery sooner; and a- 1 '
moug the reafoni he givei for the delay, the prin- eI
-cripal one, he fays, was to obtain fufficient inform- r
at ion *' of the extent and ramifications of the plot, an
and a pcrfenal acquaintance with the chief confpir- '
ators." Â°?
He then relates, that on one of the last days of 11
Germinal, he was met by one Meugmer, a taylor e
by trade ! with whom he had been acquainted in ''
I*B9. The man of (hears informed bim, he had Â°
been imprisoned fix months at Pleffis, on account,
ss he said, of his patriotifin ; and he desired him
to accompany him to the Geneva cofFee-houfe, 0
where he found a number of neighbour's friends a
ex-prisoners like himfelf; and who at his inflance
received him as one of the brotherhood.âGrifel, jjl
however, not very well pleafejl with the " ultra- '
revolutionary conversations" of such patriots, re- t0
solved not to visit W em again.
On the 2d inft. he was accosted near the Greve, #s
by one of the fame Jacobin patriots, called Mo- w
nfcÂ»n ...vKâ, 1.-
of his friends.âln the course/os conversation, he P'
confidentially informed him of the existence of a "
iecret committee of public fafety and of infurrec- ''
tion ; and that the itlfarijeftion which he, the quoa- 1
dam belt-maker was ! was nigh at hand :
"On this information," fays*Grifel, " I perceiv- w
ed that an opportunity has offered of gloriously P'
serving my country. I seized it, and thsrefore lR
armed myfelf with dissimulation."
The two patriots invited Grifel to the Temple 31
of Reason (for so they called the CofFee-houfe,
known by the name of the Chineie Baths) where w
he found a confufed affembly.of both sexes, whose 8
coÃverfation, fengs, and four looks, recalled to a
mind the dreadful reign of terror.
His two mentors praised his Robefpierian zealâ, 0
his own discourse confirmed their assertions, and he c
was soon surrounded and caressed by the whole a
1!
groupe.
A man who appeared to be one of their chiefs, P
and whose name he afterwards found to be Darthe, j
paid htm particular attention, and gave him /ome J
of Baboeuf's pamphlets. that if he
could procure this fellow's acquaintance, be might, *
through him, acquire more information refpe&ing P
the confutation. He proposed to compose a pam
phlet with Jacobinical ttyle ; which being accept- v
ed, he iinifhed it the fame evening, and to be di- v
ftributed throughout the Republic. It confided of J'
a preamble of Bor 10 articles, nnd an order for a
the people to fall, without diflinftion, on the Di- v
rectory and Bodies!
He then read a Proclamation, which was to make n
its appearai.ee (Ã¼bfequent to the last-mentioned a
piece, ordering the general pillage and slaughter of
the richâthe aobledw'-the priests, and of all the au- 1
thoritiesâAn amendment was added to this aft, c
more terrible than all the reltâthey were received
by the conspirators with general applause. After
wards appeared a lift of upwards of 60 Chiefs of f
Infurreftion who were to aft in different places.
In the course of the conversation, Grifel difcov- '
ered that Felix Pelletier procured the neeeffary
funds, and that Drouet was to head the infurrec- !
tion. . 1
The Siying terminated at 7 P. M. when it was
resolved :â
1. That the Committee of Infurreftion fhonld
hold their next meeting at another house. Â» .
2. That Roffignol, Ger|nain, Mansard, Fay
an, and himfelf (Grifel) should be a Military Com
mittee, charged to prepare the military means of '
inforreftion, and to correspond with the Secret '
Commitiee, through Germain. This Committee !
fat on the 12th and 13th. '
Grifel concludes his declaration, by affirming
that Drouet and Baboeuf visited each other daily, '
and that the latter frequently composed the speech- )
es the former was to deliver in the Council of 500
âdelivered if to him the next day at the Coffee- '
House. It pleased Darthe (an ex-secretary of Jo 1
feph Lebon), who promised to have it printed, and '
desired him to call the next day for a few hundred '
copies, to distribute among the troops.
The next day lie delivered him about one hund- 1
red copies of his pamphlet, and also fom-papers un
der cover, which he made him hide in his bof&m, '
and desired him not to open it 'till he was at home
and by himfelf. 011 opening it, he found it was '
a Brevet of secondary and military agent of the secret
Committee of Public Safety and InfurreSion, with
infiruftions at larga and information concerning the
plans hi the Secret Committee, and of his duties.
Grifel's duty at camp prevented him from feeing
Darthe until the nth, when he sent a meflagede
firing to fee him ; he accordingly went to his house,
where not finding bim, lie was concluded by a per
son who was there to another house, where he saw
Darthe and four other perfonsâDarthe immedi
ately feid to him :â" Dear friend, the boar of re
venge being at hand, and the Tocsin of Liberty |
being about to- be rung, the Committee has thought
proper to strengthen the zeal of the Chiefs of the
Infurreftion by, admtiting them into its bosom to
con.ert together the plan of exscution."â"Be

lone are acknowledged as such by every true patri

1 ccaf, Â©ertrain, Bnaaarolte and D dnif.â ;

Some time after, three other Conspirators, to wit,
the ex-general Fayan, ex-generalÃoffignol.and
Mansard, a displaced officer, joined the Con pna
CT Babceuf then read the aft of infurreftion, of
which it was decided to print 6 0 ,Â°0 0 cop'es-

" Tet did not the chief butler remember Joftfih, bu ed
forgat him ," ! lc
THIS was a moll unlucky instance of Hi irtnels inv
of memory, and a ft range one too, for Jofcph had (' Jf
expressly stipulated with the imprisoned bmler, that on
he should recollect the favorable interpreter of bis c h|
dream, and obtain from Pharoah an orcirr for Ms w.
"Forget him ! IÂ« it possible ? Did the chief but- ftu
ler, as he filled the cup to Pharoah, taste the wine thÂ«
â  so often, that it made him stupid or mad ? Was re
the vine juice of Egypt ever mixed with poppy wa- fcl
ter, that it might, like the fabled river of oblivion an
drown memory and her tribes ? As I know of no wf
' ancient record, that alludes to this prafl.ee,and in trj
' the biography with which Moles has indulged us,
of tVic chief butler not a syllable is said, concerning be
t his debauchery, I believe that the supposition that ge
he was a toper must be waved. We mull look a tb
little deeper than the bottom of a glass, or even a ex
J bottle to difcovet the fouree of a eourtier's ingra- th
titude. la '
' Let us look, therefore, once more into the book mi
1 of Genesis, and I trust, that so lucid an Hiltorian, rei
' as Moses, will shed light upon ihis sombre fubjeft. mi
It appears Joseph, of an attcinpt
upon the virtue of Potiphar's wife, was by the in- as
' ttigation of that harridan of antiquity, committed ch
to prison. According/to the sacred text, this was co
a State prison, a kind of Egyptian tSaflile, where, pc
as we read, " The King's prisoners were bound " ot
' wher? meaner felons were excluded, and none were m
'1 Kilt -Â»Â»Â«l -retainers to the nc
Â° palace, as had, by their carelessness or their critnes, w
forfeited the royal favor. It is no great wonder Si
then that a couple of who had such tli
frequent temptations to cheat, as a butler and a ba- "
" ker, should be put in ward. Light bread and four fu
wine had been rendered in the palace, and theabuied ft
palate of Pharoah was offended. Joseph, who had c<
ingratiated himfelf with the chief goaler, was ap- ti
pointed a fort of deputy or turnkey of the prison, di
e and had the charge of these vety delinquents. d'
One morning, " Behold they were fad and b
"' e when interrogated concerning the cause of their ai
* e gloom, they informed Joseph that they had dreamed o
and there was no interpreter. The chief tutler then rt
related that he had seen in a vision a clustered vine, t<
of triple branches, whose gtapes he preffedinto the fc
cup, and gave into the hand of Pharoah. Joseph, a
I after comforting the ptifoner by familiarly explain- si
ing his dream and promiling him reftoraiion to his w
s post in the houfchold, pathetically befeeches-him q
that he would in his prosperity reflect on his unjull- t
' e ly accufedfriend,, and mention him to his prince. f<
" Think on me, fays the beautifully simple original, d
t when it shall be well with thee, and (hew kinduefs I si
' pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me to o
Pharoah, and bring me out of this house." This d
( was] surely an easy service ;an3 on the third day, b
when Pharoah feafted his servants, when amid the t
jollity of ail entertainment, the released butler flood ii
)r at the elbow of his appeased sovereign, what a fa- 11
vorable moment tofuggell the propriety of loosing
poor Joseph, who had been so unjuftiy bound. But I
ce mark an obsequious, callous, courtly slave. Intent a
alone upon his own prosperity, he is so bafy in fil- (
ling the ruddy cup for his king and for himfelf, that 1
u _ not a thought of him who has nothing to f
drink, but his own tears and the waters of afflidfion. c
A felfifh and ungrateful man, though he should out- a
, r . live the oldest of the patriarchs, and allay she thitft f
o Â£ of a lineage of Egyptian monarchs would not once j
think of his benefactor, nor call to mind that vision- c
v _ ary vine which he had fecn in adversity. No ; a 1
chief butler would have much a more lucrative em- 1
, c _ ployment than thinking upon the " Sorrowfulfigh- t
ing of a prisoner." The chief butler did not remÂ«m- f
as ber Joseph, but forgat him. t
And are there not a thousand worldly rcafors for t
lid 'hu forgetfulnefs ? Prudence f.iight vvhifper to the t
butler as he walked through the prison gate, not to r
lisp the name of Joseph, for possibly it might anger i
in. Pharaoh, and then his favor would be withdrawn, t
and the lutlerjhip ! Â«Besides, we (hould remember 1
that this dreamer-in prison was a very courtier in I
ee the palace ; watchful enough of his own, and "deal- 1
ing out his promises as â¢ liberally as his Jiquor." 1
np When Joseph had unravelled his entangled dreams, (
I ' and foretold that he (hould again have the keys of 1
I Pharaoh's beaufet and cellar, I dare affirm that the (
3Q butler, vvith cringing complaisance, with low bows (
e _ and a perpetual smile, engaged upon his honor not j
o merely to remember, but to remunerate his deliver- t
nd er " was of a courtier.âAnd i
ed 18 'g nor ant that his engagements, like " your <
humble servant" at the t.ottom of a challenge, <
|Â£ ] mean, if they have any meaning, nothing but death ,
/n . an d dellrudlion ?âMany are the promises ef the
chief butlers, the Chefterfields, the smooth-tongued
n'e men of the wotld. They hp them tooâ but so
;as c ty e ' w^ eJI l he day"Â»f peiformance arrives.

PARIS, May 1.
We have spoken of a letter from the Directory
to the Magistrates of Basil, relative to niiftruft which I
they entenaincd of a profpeft in favor of the prince
of Conde and the nnigrants : The following is the
answer which the magistrates addreifed to our am
baflador Bart nelemi, and which we have taken Jrom
the Courier of Strafburg.
Letter of the Magistrates of Basil, to Citizen Bar
theienrli, Ambassador of the Fiench Republic
to the Swiss C<-jjitons.
Your Excellency has addressed to us with your
letter of the sth of April, a writing from the Ex
ecutive Directory, which appears to be a rcfolution
copied from their records. We pass without any
observations cxn the form of it which is so unusual,
becgufe weought-tofuppofe that it has been through'
mistake that it has been sent to us in that manner ;
and because wa ought to believe that the govern
ment wili ever leave the concerns of llrangers to
their own deliberations exclusively. But if the
form of that writing has appeared ftrangc to us,
its ten<fehcy ought to appear much niore so, as
your excellency will be convinced by our answer.
The Executive Directory have told us that the
corps of emigrants were about attempting an in
valion through our territory. It does not become
us to doubt the proofs of it. which they may have
in their peffeflion ; but we ought however to ob
serve, that at the opening of every campaign, a.
teportjif n lik-r project has been circulated, with
out itsever having been attempted ; so that we art
â¢ really lt a loss to know whether thofc reports have
been ?ere ftraiagems of war, or whether they have
been abandoned on account of other tflential cir- *
cumftances which wo*ldhave rendered the attempts 5
vain or futile* and which indeed we think the mod
probable, whether it has not been that the cabinet
of Vienna, which has ever refpetted our neutrali
ty, hath not opposed the disturbing tfae repwfe of
an independent people, who for these many ages,
content with their own limits, have ever taken the
smallest part in the difisntions of the great powers
of Europe. But abbve all, wÂ« are well' aflured
that there is not afiually jjny kind of danger. The
corps of emiptants are too distant from our fron
tiers ; their forces are no: fufficient tur the plan
fuppofad, neither have w'e observed any of those
dispositions or prÂ»p*rations which such a plan would f,|
tequire. â¢ _ tl
The twelfth article of the note of the Direfto- w
ry relative to the defence of our tenitoiy, demands
.from us, according to that report, a fufficient gua- y
rantec. No neutral people can give such a one.
If the belligerent powers, by their fortrefTes, their
formidable lines, their armies and the union of all
their forces, cannot secure their own provinces a
gamft an invading euemy, much less can a neutral
people do it-, and the aOTembling of its forces, far (
fiom ensuring its fafety, would neceflarily create f
tnidfuft. The expences, moreover, which such a| c
measure would occasion, are beyond our strength, r
weakened as we are daily by the misfortunes of the t
timeÃ. But there is another kind f>f guarawtee, ]
which, in our opinion, avails more than that which ;
is founded on our military strength. But guaian- j
tee is founded on the faith of the powers at war, ;
and in their intered. It is founded in that firm re- ,
solution which the Swiss Cantons have unanimously ,
taken of nevei - departing from those principles of
a scrupulous neutrality which they lit inherited
from their ancefters, and in the knowledge which
their neighbours have of this determination. It
is also founded in the difficulties which their country
itfelf opposes tn the pafTage of troops since the in
vading party would have its retreat inevitably cut
off by the arrival of the contingents of our confe
derates, ready to avenge, with the greatefl ardor,
an insult offered to that neutrality which they
themselves religiously observe.
We now come to the chaige which the Direct
ory have made againd the magistrates of Batii, and
againd some burghers of this and other Cantonsâ
a charge vag'ne and without example. The opi
nion and will of the foyereignty in a Republic, is
to be known by their resolutions folqmnly taken
and not f rem the private opinion of individuals. But
however widely individuals among us may differ in,
I opinion, they, Beverthelefs, all unite in one com
mon point, and that point is a love for their coun
try, and a conviction that the jlriftejl rftulrd/ity is
the foundation of our political exijlence. By inte
grity our good-will and our friendfhip are gaiiied.
Our hearts are changed by vague reproaches and
demonstrations of mistrust. What would it be if '
that midrud had for its foundation the mere tales
e of men, wlÂ«o, of guilty views, inf#:red by venge
ance, hatred or ambition, would exaggerate what
was in itfelf inflgnificant ; would paint in the mod
glowing colours what was indifferent ; and wosld
conceal that which would explain the true fpitjt of
our views and of our political ftepsj
ThFDireflory, in fee, maTces us responsible for
the operations of war. We know that every govern
ment is answerable for the faults which through
forgetfulnefs of its duties and its oaths it knowing
ly commits. But calm and tranquil in dur princi
r pies, proud of that sentiment of freedom and 1111-
changeablenefs which i 3 the sole guide of our nego
ciations, we are ready to take upon ourselves that
responsibility : we are all but as one man, and we
can count not only upon the inhabitants ofourown
canton, but upon all the members! of the confede
ration.
Your excellency during the course of your diffi
cult million was impressed by us with very different
sentiments,- and the dire&oty have lately expretfeci
on that fubjefl their highed fatisfadlion. We dc
k. not at all doubt but_that, prefentÂ«l by you, the an
{wer we fend you will, after a deliberation with th<
if- reprefsntatives of the Helvetic Body, be favorablj
>e- received.
>r, We pray God to take you in his holy and power
fil> ful keeping,

from Yarmouth, whither they had keen on eleÂ£t on- j

imagined it was at fomediftance ; and drove on 'till j s j Â£)IW
he entered town, when he (lopped and atked lord w j )ert
Frederick where he would be driven to, who wildly t j )e c |

Yesterday, about ele'ven o'clock, the tht re Can- 7
â¢ didates, Chsrks James Fox, Esq. admiral fir Al- ; rcu
> lan Gardener,- and John Home Tooke, Etq. arriv- rflore
' ed on the Hustings. After the deputy of the
High-Bailiff had read the Precept and the feyeral
atts of Pailiament, Mr. Fox was nominated by Mr.
| T. Scott, and seconded hy Mr. Harry House.. He j Â®
then addrefled the electors in a very (hort speech, in |
_ which he reminded them how often they had vhofen j
j him for their reprefemative ; and ventured to feel Ij.
[, pretty confident, if his pall conduct had met with 1 g
t their appiobation, as he trusted *it had, that they I
l( would hjjain commit their interells to his charge. j y.,..
!_ Sir Thomas Turton then nominated Admiral fir Al- J .
lan Gardner, in a very animated speech, in which he j
enumerated (he various and important services perform- | * ,acl
!S ed by the gallant Admiral, which could not fail to feuure j join
to him the admiration, protection and gratitude of e- I beti
I. very true Englishman. He dwelt on his brilliant exer- j
d tions on the glorious nth of April, and the no less glo- I 3n( j
if lious ift of June, now fre(h in every mm's memory, I
, s for which he had received the approbation of his So- I " ,
vereign, and the unanimous thanks of both Houses of j 1 c
Parliament. He had on many occasions, rifqi.ed his I mOl
life for his countrymen, every individual of whom he J Ch
1 had laid under obligations, by his services : those they I the
Id had now an opportunity to-repay. Sir Thomas spoke j ; n g
of V ith modelly of his coming forward on this occasion, I (
which he declared ht* did as an independent man, zea- I
* r loiifly Sffacied to the' coriTlitution of his country. â I
The motion wrs seconded by Admiral Ommaney.
n " Sir A. Gardner then addrefled the election with all I w a
?'â¢ the pkin, snanly eloquence peculiar to British Seamen, j wi!
f â  He said, that he came forward to â¢fier himfelf to their j dit
_i- notice, in consequence of the ftrongrft solicitations of j ,} ll
m- many most refprAable eleflors. He lpoke with modes- j j* U(
c . ty of his pretentions to their favour, they were merely I, .
founded on his having dtvoted forty years of his life I
to the service of his King and his Country* His hav- I '
" e iivg been thus employed, it could not be expelled that Jth
" pn he should be qualified to expreft himlelf with any elo- I ofl
ie- quence, This he mÂ«ft therefore leave to others. He I L
declared h i vat nicnt the be ft of Kings, and fixed j
ffi. determination to exert himlelf on all occasions, in de- j m
ent fence of our glorious Constitution, against its enemies, 1
r 1 whether domestic or foreign. He was not much in the J
j habits of making profeffions. Should theelei!lor4 think I
"Â° him worthy of thehonorable fituationto which he pre- 1 N
an " fumed to aspire, it (hould bethepride of his lifeto (hew Jtc
ihe his gratitude, by discharging the duties of the impor
bly tant trust eommitted to his care, with honor & fidelity.
The Admiral's speech, delivered throughout with Urt- c(
k . er . common feeling, was received with loud, acclamations
of Gardner and Victory 1
Mr. Tooke was then propoftd by Mr. Felix Vaug- a
han, and seconded by Mr. Sharpe. He only laid, that o
Â°' he did npt think itjneceffary to trouble the electors,
as the Hbn. Baronet had made a Speech long enough f<
for the three Candidates. v
7C The returning officer Ithen declared the (hew of y
hands to be in favor of Mr. Fox and Mr. Alan Gard
ner ; on which Mr. Tooke demanded a Poll, which
commenced at 12 o'clock, and closed at seven. At
eight o'clock, the numbers were declared to be, for Mr. r

1 her DEATH OF LORD CHARLES TOWNSHEND. r
iweil POLICE OFFICE, MARLBOROUGH STREfjf. r
58, I We yefttrday (liortly hinted at one of tne mod ]
' out ' melancholy tranfaÂ£ions it has ever fallen to our lot ,
, 43 ' 'to record. The following are some further parti- [
! culars of that unfortunate accident, which have |
jays' come regularly before the public: Lord Charles ;
Â»fton Townfhend, and his brother Lord Fiedertck ,
Townfhend, sons to the Marquis Townfhend, had
been at Great Yarmouth, for which place Lord |
'fail Charles had been just chosen Representative : they |
fay. arrived in town yesterday mprning'about fix o'clock, ]
and when they reached Oxford-flreet, near the Pan
theon, the poll-boys (lopped to enquire where the
Bifhopof Norwich, to whole house they had been
ordered to dr.ve, lived ; when Lord Frederick -
jumped out-of the chaise, and (truck one of the
boys, which gave rife to an altercation, that drew
together several persons who were passing by. He
infilled upoffit, that the boy knew wh.re the
J une- (hop lived ; and on the man's protesting that be did
not, his Lordship abused him with grear violence,
and with the molt deplorable marks of lnfanity, he
urgh, threw off hiscoat, waistcoat, and (hirt, challenged
28. hi!â¢ to fight. Unable to provoke the man to a Â«on
itelt, he walked leisurely away towards Hanover
fquarc, when some person who had ueen attentive
to the whole scene, looked into the carriage, and
saw a lifelefs on the feat, which proved to be
the corpse of Lord Charles. L V d Frederick was
T"'" immediately pursued, and being taken near the end
:pt 'Â° n " of 3wallow-(treet> wis conduced to a ne.ghboyr
tf ing watch-house.
As soon us tlae Magiftvatfi M 4-e QUice,
in Mirlboro'jgh-ltreerv wen apprized of thecitcoGi*
Itance, they ordered Lord Frtdrrickto be brought
before them, together with the podilions who drove
him to town. His Lordihip when interrogated oa
the melancholy fitbjeft, bettayed the raoft unetjuivo
cal fymptoras ot'-a mental derahgertiear, ar.d it be
came neceflary far the Magistrates to apply to the
poftiliolis sot the informal ion they wanted.
The sr(t person examined was Chi illopher Airy,
a postilion, who depofedthat he lived at the Angel
Inn, at flltord ; that he was called out of bed at >
four o'clock this morning {Friday) by the arrival
of a gentleman's chariot. He affiled to ptlt four
fiefh liOrfes to it, and with another drivel- set off to
London. The glasses Vere up. and he was order
ed to Hanover- Square, by a geirtleman in the car' iÂ»
age, dreffee in black. ( Lord Frederick Townfliend);
he saw no other gentleman in the cattiage ; and
was pbfitive that there was no other on the feat,
because, it t/here had been, he must have seen him.
The gentleman i,n black paid the Stratford turn
pike. They then drove on, and he heard rio noifd
whatfoevcr until they came near the Globe at
town-end, when he heard the report of a pistol in
the carriage, and turning about, saw Lord Frede
risk wave iiie hÂ»t, aftd heard him hollow several
times, and make a great deal of noise.-*âWhen they
arrived at the corner of Argyle-llreet, in Oxfoid
ftreet, he alighted to alk the gentleman where he
was to drive )tim to ? who said, to the Bishop of
Noiwich's ; but upon faying that he did not know
â¢where thÂ« Bifliop lived, the gentleman eathe out of
the chariot, and struck him over the face, and swore
he would knock him down. Lord Fredrick walk*
ed about without attempting to make off, and (hip
ped off his ceat, waistcoat and (birt ; opened the
knees of his, breeches, and talked cf fighting. He*
the degonent, then went to the doof of the
and saw a dead man lying oil the culliion. The
yreople then came up, furrotinded Lord Frederick,
and tc.Â»k liim to the watch-house.
John March,.the other driver, corroborated every
' circumstance ("worn to by Airy ; he did not fee
itiore than one gentleman in the chariot. He far
\ ther added, that Lord Frederick, before they set
out, gave him two guineas, which he desired hitn
' J to give to any poor ptrfon, and said, 'â¢ perhaps yott
C I may fee some widow v(ho has adiftreffed family."
" j He also offered him more money ; but the oftlir
defued him to put his money in his pocket, hÂ«
I said, " Aye, I believe 1 had better."
Sir Edmund Laton said, that Tie went down
y with Lords Charles and Frederick Towhfhend to
Yarmouth ; he never saw a stronger affection than
there always had been between the brothers, tior
v had they any difference while at Yarmouth. They
re joined in the fellivity at the Election too much., and
e- betrayed both of them, but particularly Lord
r " Charles, the mod 1. dubitable fymptorfia of insanity,
and chiefly after dinner and supper. They fre
y' quently went alone about Yarmouth, cryuig, that
Â°f their enemies were their belt friend*, dispensing their
,is money lavishly, and without diflinftion j and Lord
he Chavles went into one of the horlfes belonging to
ey the opposite Candidate,, and narrowly efeaped be
ing thrown out of the window by the opposite par
ty.' The day before the Elcftion, his friends ob
served him to be so much deranged, that they were
afraid he fouW not fland the Poll ; however, there
all was no opposition. After the eledtion he talked
en. wildly after dinner ; and, that night, the family was
eir disturbed by his continually opening and (hutting
the window shutters; the next morning he was in
lci ' such a (late, that his friertd locked the door upon
Jjk him. Sir Edmund said, that the friends of
av t Lord Charles and Lord Fiederick wished to get
hat them out of Yarmouth fli soon as poflÃhle ; #ud he
slo- offered to accompany th?m in their chariot, but
He Lord Charles declined taking him as a companion,
xed faying, that his servant was too ill to drive, and he
? e " must take him in the Carriage with him. He. (Sir
" t "e Edfcinnd), however, followed them to towo in the
Mail Coach, with an intention of informing the
pre- Marquis of their fitimtiou, He could not speak as

lons the pilloLwas put into the mouth of the deceased,
aug . and the bullet came out at the back pait Â«f the top
that of his ; the teeth were not hurt.

This Lottery will afford an elegant fjiecimen of thie pri- 1
vatb buildings to be ereited ill the City of Washingtonâ n
Two beautiful designs are already fele&ed for the entire a
fronts on two of the public squares; from these prawihgs
it isjiropofed to erect two centre and four corner buildings, 0
as soon as polfible after this lottery is fold, and to convey v
| them, when complete, to the fortunate adventurers, in
the manner described in the scheme for the Hotel Lottery. '
A nett deduction of five per cent, will be made to defray a
the necessary expenses of &c, and the surplus
will be made a part of the fund intended fotr the National I
Ufiiverfity, to be erected within the city of Washington.
The Drawing will commence as' soon as the tickets are a
fold off.âThe inoffty prizes will be payable in thirty days '
after it is finifhsd ; and-any pr zeÂ« for which fortunate r
e _ numbers aie not produced within twelve mqnths after the. a

e_ the funi for the Univcrfity ;it being determined to fettle f
tb? whole business in a year from the ending of the draw- 1
10 in g> an< J t0 take up the bonds given as security.
The. real fecuritjes given for the payment of the Prizes, e
_ are held by the President and two Directors of the Bank '
of Columbia, and are valued at more than half the a
mount ol thy. lottery. f
The twenty tour gentlemen who by appointment of '
:d the late Comruiflipners assisted in the managemetre of the
11 Hotel Lottery are requested to undertake this arduous task
of a second time on behalf of the public ; a fufficient num
ber of these having kindly accepted, it is hoped that the J
Dr friends to a National Univcrfity and the other federal ob- 3
er jeits may continue to favor the design.
:h By accounts received from the different parts of the
to Continent as, well as from Europe, where the tickets
Js ; have been sept for sale, the public are allured that thÂ®
e. drawing will fpeedily.compienÂ»e,.and that the care and
