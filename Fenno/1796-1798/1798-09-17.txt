From a London Paper.
SIEGE O~F LYONS.
Even those who admire the French revo
lution, cannot view the following scene but
n with horror and deflation. It is a faithful
pit Sure of the memorable siege of Lyons,
r and may serve to show the savage ferocity
of all the Jacobins, when t}Â»e chance of war
favours their diabolical designs.
" During* the space of sixty dayr, they
(the Lyonefe) withstood an army of fifteen
times their flrength, plsntifully provifiohed.
and provided with every instrument of def
-8 trutftion. Never perhaps, were thÂ«re such
featis of valour performed as by this li' Ile
army ; thrice their numbeis did they lay
dead before their injured city. The besieged
1 hen feeing no hopes of a capitulation ; fee
ing the city without another day's provi
sion, and the total impoflibility of fuecour
a from without, beiog completely inverted on
every fide, had but one m aftire to adoptâ
" to cut their way through the enemy or fall
P in the attempt. A plan of retreat was there
fore fettled upoj); the out polls were to be
f called in, and the whole were to assemble at
' the Vaife. It was midnight when they be
j. gin their retreat, lightened by the blaze of
' bombs and burning houses. Reader call
your eyeS on this devoted city. See chil
dren cling to their fathers, diftrafted mo
thers to their sons; wives, holding in tht ir
arms what they held dearer than life, for
getting all but their husbands marching by
their fide, and braving death by ten thou
sand hands ! But what were they to c'o
0 ngaitift -fifty times their number? Tke
it whole, about perfons excepted, were
I. either butchered, or tricen, to gratify by â¢
torture, the barbarous disposition of the
viclors. i_
After viewt&g tiiit of horror and
j dismay, what,
wi(li for the trinm'pli jo tiris.epUotry, of the
Correfpondrg Societies, v.-iioft fleeting
reign would.be rendered iiifc-'tious by similar
barbarities.
The citizens of the city of Philadelphia,
the Northern Liberties, and Southwark. are
requeftrd to meet at three 6'clock, P. M.
on Tuesday next, the 18th inft. at Richar
det's Tavern, in Germantown to take into
confidleration the necfliety of furnifhing em
ployment for their diflreffed fellow citi.V'ns
who are at present without any means of
fubfiff ence.
The great numbers now out of the city
and Unemployed, and of course destitute of
the means of procuring bread, require the
attention ef the charitable and htimane part '
of the cominonityâTo provide employment
and the me-mi of gaining a livelihood by ho
nefl induftrv, will be at once affording relief
from difttefs, preventing idleness, the mod

Yefttrday we had re.port* in circulation, ]
that the United States armed brig Sophia, J,
had been spoken with off the American v
coast having on board Mr, Gerry, and a f
French Envoy to the U. S'atet, Tra-
cing the reports, we ipuhd they come stage g
wife from Baltimore, where the person who v
spoke tie Sophia, and who heard the t
man's name, had arrived. We immediately }
recurred to our latest Baltimore papers. In ]
one of the 4th inft. we find the following ar- f
ticle: " Capt. Boyle, arrived yesterday from c
Bourdeaux, received a letter the day before t
be failed, from a vtry refpeftable and well t
informed gentleman at Paris, which inform {
ed him, that Mr. Gerry was to leave Paris j
for Havre in two days, accompanied by a 1
French gentleman, whose objeft is to fettle J
the .nifunder(landing between the two Re- (
publics." This article we, brieve to be the 1
parent of the reports. Let us examine dates (
and circumstances. t Capt Boyle, arrived at :
Baltimore the 3d inft. alter 70 days paffagt. (
Thus it appears he received the letter the J
25th June, which must have been written at â ,
Paris as early as Ihe 20th.âWe have papers (
direÂ£t from Paris rfs late as the 10th Jclyâ 1
which make.no m'eilticn of the matter. It |

terifions to eai.doixr and desire of recor.cilia- j
tion will be Frtnch praflite, now they know j ,
the eitizeni. of the United States are not a ' ,
" diviledpeople.'' God be praised, we have
an Adams fii ogr Senate, grid a Washing
ton ready to take the SelJ. Tile former is
acc}::ainted with the 'â¢ diplomatic
fiill" of the Fl'cucli-âlf three Envoys are.

ly as MefTr., Pmciney, Mcirjhall, and Gerry
have been tveated itl : But if only
one is feot, He will unqneftiona'oly cottfider
it as a frcfli insult, and.if. he (hould fee foot
on American ground, will order him to quit
the country as an alien enemy.
The Packet letters from England all ac
cord fn the idea, that the French Directory
deprecate an open war with the United
Stius ; âthat they have heard of the spirit
and unanimity which pervades the conti
nent that they have received an agent
from the Jcfferfon party, advising to teni
porifiiig meafurts ; and 1 at the probability
was they would fend an Envoy or Envoys to
try their (kill in America.
The Emperor of Ruifia has improved up>
on the French Dire&ory's "prefa-gag plan.
The latter swear that French printers may ,
print ; but that they shall print only what
luiu their sovereign will and plpfurf ;
whereas the RirilTan Direflor swears the
printers (hall print nothing. It is astonish
ing, with what facility one tyrant imitates
another.
The Swedish government has bryn occefii
ated to emit a paper currency. In detailing
the ratlfes which has produced the necefli
ty, they fay, it is partly to be attributed,
" To the reclamations which the Swedes
have made, in vain, to the French govern
ment, for the sum of 000,000 rix d 1-
lars, the amount of the cargoes of the (hips
taken from them." If the Swedes had rt
fented the fraternal squeezes of the French
with Arhtrican spirit, they would not have
been left to make their idle reclama ions ; or
to deplore a Jituation., the moll degrading
to a nationâthat of (traittir.g a p-per me
dium.
