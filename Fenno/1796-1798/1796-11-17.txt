To THOMAS JEFFERSON, Esq.
Sir, tc
1 am fully convinced of the greatness of that
freedom which I take with yeu on the present oe
cafian ; a liberty which seemed to me scarcely al
lowable, when I refle&ed on that diftingnilhed and
dignified liation in which you Hand ; and the L a !" hâ
most general prejudice and prepolTeiTion which is
so prevalent in the world against those of my com-
plexion,
, I suppose it a truth too well attested to you, to
need a proof here, that we are a race of beings
Who have long labored under the abuse and eenfure
of the world, that we have long been looked opon
with an eye of contempt, considered rather ar
brutish than human, aud scarcely capable of mental
endowments.
I hope 1 may fafelj admit, in confequejice of
that repott which has reached me, that you are a
man far less inflexible in sentiments of this nature ,
than many others, that you are measurably friend
ly and well disposed towards us, and that you arc
willing and ready to lend your aid and afliflance to C Â°
our relief from those many diftrcfTes and numerous
calamities to which we arc reduced.
Now, fir, if this Isr founded in truth, I appre- â 
heod you will readily embrace every opportunity, .
to eradicate that train of absurd and falfe ideas and
opinions which so generally prevail in [refpedt to m
t us, and that your lentiments are concurrent with
3 mine, which are, that one universal Father hath
given being to us all, and that he hath not only
made us of one fieih, but that he hath also, with- 0
out partiality, afforded us all the fame fenfatiens,
and that however variable 'we may be in society or
religion'; however diverfified in situation or colour, w
we are all of the fame family, and stand in the fame
relation to him.
If these are sentiments of which you are fully
pe fuaded, I hope you cannot but acknowledge,
that it is the irdifpfafible duty of those who main
tain for themselves the> rights of human nature,
and who prefefs the obligations of christianity, to
extend their power and influence to the relief of i,
a every part of the human taee, from whatever bur
then or oppreflion they may unjustly labor under,
c and this I apprehend a full conviction of the truth '
. and obligation of these principles should lead us Â°
' all to. "
' Sir, 1 have long been convinced, that if your c
1 love for yourfelve6, and for those inestimable laws V '
i, which preserve to you the rights of human nature, f
was founded on sincerity, you could not but be fe
licitous, that every individual of whatever rank or
diftindton, might with you equally enjoy the blef- ['
. sings thereof; neither could you reft fatisficd, fhsrt '
Of the raeft adive diffufion of your exertions, in
order to their promotion from any state of degra- n
e dation, to which the unjullifiable cruelty and bar- 3
5 barifm of men may have reduced them.
I freely and chearfully acknowledge, that lam ,
of the African race, and in that colour which is
natural to them of the deepest dye, and it is un
der a sense of the most profound gratitude to the
supreme ruler of the universe, that I noW confefs
â¢ to you, that lam not under that state of tyranni
cal thraldom, and inhuman captivity, to which toa
many efyny btethren are doomed, but that I have
abundantly tailed of the fruition of those blellingg,
a which proceed from that free and unequalled liber
g ty with which you are favored, and which 1 hope
â¢ f you will willingly allow you have received from the
immediate hand of that being, from whom pro- I
i- ceedeth every good and perfect gift. p
y Suffer me to recall to your mind that time, in v
* which the arms and tyranny of the British crown ti
were exerted with every powerful effort in order to
reduce you to a state qf Servitude ; look back I en- e
treat you on the variety of dangers to which you n
ir were exposed 5 reflect on the time in which every 0
d human aid appeared unavailable, and in which even ii
hope and fortitude wore the afpeft of inability to t
e, the confliÂ£t, and you cannot but be led to a fcrioue p
3' and gtateful sense of your miraculous and provi- v
" dential preservation ; jyu carinot but acknowledge
cl that the present freedom and tranquillity which you ti
1. enjoy, you have mercifully received, apd that it is fc
" the peculiar blessing of heaven. ' v
f e This fir was a time in which you clearly saw into t
the injustice of a state of slavery, and in wliitb you n
had just apprehensions of the horror of its condi
tion,âit was now that your abhorrence thereof was q
so excited, that you publicly held fotth this try* n
and invaluable doftrinc, which is worthy to be re- c
corded and remembered in all succeeding ages, t
"We hold ttoefe truths to be felf-evident, that all f
men are created equal, that they are endowed by a
s, their creator with certain unalienable rights, and f
a- that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit 2
*e of happiness." r
Here was a time in which your tender feelings a
for yourselves had engaged you thus to declare ; t
yon weri then impteffed witli proper ideas of the
i re *t valuation of liberty, and the free possession f
w of taofe fc>lÂ«flingi v t<) which jrou were entitled by t
A
nature; but, Gi% how pitiable is it to reflefi, that if
although'you were so fully convinced of the bent- c(
volence of the father of mankind, and of his e- c<
qual and impartial distribution of thtfe rights and ai
privileges which he had conferred upon them, that j d
you should at the fame time counteract his merceÂ», I
in detaining by fraud and violence so numerous a V
part of my brethren under groaning captivity and p
cruel oppreflion, that you fliould at the fame time t<
be fourd guilty of that most criminal aft, which 1Â«
you profeffedly detested in others, with rrfpeA to tl
yourielves. . .
I suppose that your knowledge of the situation h
of my brethren is too extensive to need a recital b
here ; neither lhall I presume to ptefcribe methods li
by which they may be relieved , otherwise than by h
recommending to you and all others, to wean youi- h
selves from those Marrow prejudices which you have fc
imbibed with refpea to them, and proposed I
to his friends, " put your foul in their fouls stead" ci
âthus (hall your hearts be enlarged with kindness o:
and benevolence towards them, and thus (hall you i.
need neither the direction of myfelf or others in ai
what manner to proceed herein. 'I
And now, fir, although my sympathy Sod affec- b
tion for my brethren hath taufed my ealarÂ£ement
thus far, I ardently hope that your candour and l'r
generotty will plead with you in my behalf, when b
1 make known to you, that it was not origisally my m
design ; but that having taken up Â«ny pen in order tl
to dire& to you as a prefcnt, a copy of an almanack ts
which I hive calculated for the fuccecding year, I fr
was anexpeftedly and unavoidably led thereto. n<
This calculation is the produftitnl of my ardu- 1
ous study in this my advanced stage of life, (59) for ol
having long had unbounded desires to become ae
quainted with the secrets of nature, I have had to tc
gratify my curiosity herein through ray own adidu- ti
ous application to allronomical Itudy, in which I p'
need not recount to you the many diffievilties and 01
disadvantages which 1 hare had to encounter.
And although I had a'.moft declined to make my fr
calculation for tfee lujuing year, in cantetfuenc* of m
that time which I had altottedtheretor being taken tl

SIR, W
I THANK you sincerely for your letter of the a
19th instant, and for the almanack it contained, ti
Nobody wi(hcs more than I do, te fee such proofs e
as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black u
brethren, talents equal to those of the other colours
of men, and that the appearance of a want of them a
is pwing merely to the degraded condition of their a
cxillence both in Africa and America. 1 can add c
with truth that no body wishes more ardently to fee 1;
a good system commenced for railing the condition t
both of their body and mind to what it ought to Â°
be, as fact as the imbecillity of their prefcnt exif- T
tencei and other circumstances which cannot be neg- v
le&ed, will admit. 1:
I have taken the liberty of fending your alma- t
nack to Monsieur de Condorcct, secretary of the v
academy of Tcieaces at Paris, and member of the a

From tie Daily Advcrtijer.
To the PEOPLE of the UNITED STATES {
IT cannot have cfcaped your observation, that
Providence seems, in a remarkable manner, to have '
promoted your prosperity, by the very means j
which unprincipled men have, at various times, in
tended to tffed your ruin,
The unbounr d usurpations of the Britiffi gov- *
ernmant, compelled us to the cAteft, which termi- '
nated in independence. Thair infatuation became '
our salvation ; and, for a series of years, the bless- C
ings of good government, with foreign and domes- !
tic peace, have raised us to a pitch of national im- '
portance and prosperity, for the time, perhaps, ne- *
ver equalled in the annals of mankind.
The firft appearance of the French revolution, "
J must have excited the roost lively feelings ia the
s brealts of those solitary individuals throughout the *
world, who, though oppressed by the hard hai*J of '
a tyranny, had formed a just cilimate of the riVKts of '
i man. 1
But, in this weftetn hemisphere, a whole nation
s of freemen, exulted as if animated by one com
t rnon spirit, at the profpeft that twenty.fix millions
- of people, who had no other idea of liberty than
n of ' dollfln g 'he grand monarch, were about to
(hake oft the (hackles of slavery, and become a free '
f and independent people. That we (hould have a
litter republic, which, contrary to the insidious t
t and mterefted policy of other governments, would 1
rejoice in our prosperity, a âd raa i nta in a friendly 1
s and (raternifing intercourse, untainted by wild am- t
; 0Â»J0R, and motives of felf interest alone. .
c 1 hefe pleasant imaginations, however, were dif- t
n pelled, by the arrival of a minister, chargcd with r
jr potver* andinitruftiwrn to involve the United States t
in an European war. The happiness of a vf*iol e
communityâa total derangeihent of all fifcal con
cernsâand an accumulation of immense debts and
' and taxations upon, probably, our ehildreus chil
dren weie to be the facrifice on the part of the
United States, 'without one fmgle ohjeÃ of advantage.
Very different, indeed, were the inducements which
prompted the ei-devant government of France to
take part with us iri-our contest with Great-Bri
tainâbeing nothing lef> than the feveration of all
the colonies of the dominion of their ancient rival
The grand monarch and his ministers would never
hare lent us one livre, nor have spilt one drop 0 f
blood on that eccalion, merely from their love of
libertyâAnd the then miserable people of France
had no idea of the true principles of civiland p 0 !
litical liberty ; much less did they, as a nation of.
fer or rifle iheir their lives for our independent.
Hence it is, that I have ever been at a loss to con.
ceive how we are baund in gratitude to the people
of France. If there is any gratitude in the-tafe
u must be certainly due to the manes of that mon'
arch, and 3 few individuals, upon wkofedeftru&ion
tire nation have since ere&ed the guillatine of li.
berty.
1 cannot conclude this iiigreffion without abferv.
ing, that in the adjustment of a treaty of peace
between Great-Britain and America, the French
ministry had by the fubtility of intrigue, at which
they are proverbially dexteroUs, so managed cer.
tain members of congress, as to get inftruSions
from aur government to their commissioners, to do
nothing, but in concert with Mr. Vergennes.â.
These dupe* to French politics, have been the pells
of this country to the present hour.
Mr. Vergennes used all his cunning and influence
to induce aur commissioners to enter into negocia
tions without the acknowledgement of our inde
pendenceâ-to rob us of the fiffieriesâand to limit
our botindcries weft ward by the Ohio,
By what means, fellow-citizens, were we rescued
from the base designs of these perfidious Frcaeh
ilienâikefe boasted friends and alliesâtheft apef-*-,
ties of liberty, to vvtiura -we are bound by eternal
ties of gratitude ? By the penetration and firmnrls
of that man, principally, who negociated the Bri
<ti(h treaty, and fared jis from being again involved
iu all the calamities of war.
By Mr. Jay, and Mr. Adam 9, who, fuperinr to
the artifices, corruption, and intrigues both of the
French and Britilh ministry, at the hazard of an
impeachment for a breach of orders, nobly and firm
ly opposed the ignominious and treacherous devices
of our good French allies, until they were compel
led to grant us, as a preliminary, that independence '
we now polTcfs. But for them, we flmuld', it this
day, probably, have enjoyed Batavian libertyâthe
liberty of obeying the commands of a Marat, a
Robespierre, a Jacobin club, or that five-headed
monster, the Directory. These commissioners
were the saviours of their countryâand, like
the jirjl, have received a poor and ominous fpcci.
men of republican gratitude.
But to returnâProvidence, for this time, palsi
ed the defrges of our allies, by the intemperance
and indiscretion of their minister, who, being de
ceived by Mr. Jefferfon, and the party who threw
thcmfelvcs into his bnffinv 1 rft âanj
excited that lpirit of national pride and isdig .ation
which (hould forever fire the foul of every hanelt
and independent Americra, at any impudent at
tempt of any European nation or minister to influ
ence our government, or piaiftife deceptious arts
upon free and enlightened republicans.
It would have been supposed, that the checks
and mortifications given to Mr. Genet, would have
afforded some direction for the coaduft of his fuc
cefTors ; that our interrjal enemies, being repeated
ly defeated in all their machinations with the French
to difarganife the government, or break the union,
or involve us in war; after a full discovery, upon
repeated proofs, that the great mass of Americans
were deter mined, and were able, to support the
laws and of their conntry, against
both foreign and domeftie violence and intiigue ;
would have been covered with shame and remerfe,
and have desisted from their wicked pursuits.
It would have been supposed, that the govern
ment of France, however fafely they might pre
sume to insult and controul the deliberations of
people within the immediate vortex of their power,
would have sense and discretion enough not to make
similar attempts Â»pon a government, frparsted-by
an ocean of three thoufasd miles ; and upon a na
tion, such as, finco the flood, never existed upon
the face of the earthâa nation, I mean, of inde
pendent freeholdersâthe nation, which jirft (hewed
them the road to freedomâa nation, which re
fpe<3s the original principles of their revolution,
and which, at this moment, wishes them, moftsar
dially, a return of with all the blefiings at
tendant upon a free, equal and independent repub
lican form-of government.
But all these confidcrations notwithstanding, the
government of France seems infatuated, or deter
mined to convioce the world, that names are empty
things; that republicans who have power, will fxer
cife it, with as much abuse as despotic princes; that
they are ss much influenced by pride, ambitieii, in
justice and felf interest, at the people of any other
governments ; and that where the iaft prevails, they
make no discrimination between friends or tues,
allies or neutrals, republicans or anti-rcpublicars.
Of these things, we have a specimen in the late
conduct of the Directory, refpeiiing the American
. commerce, and the confequerit extraordinary beha
viour of their minister, Mr. Adet ; both of which
will be the fubjedl of another address, from
WM. WI.LLCOCKS.

For the Gazette of the United States.
To the Electors of the President of the United Slater.
Altho the merits of the cafididates for the Prefi
-1 dency have been very amply difeu/Ted, the papers
have been ncarlv fifent on the fubjefil of Vice-Pre
lident. This officer is by the constitution diretied
to per/orm tire duties of President of the Senate,
a very important (lation, and, is, moreover, to fill
the Executive chair, in the event of the death or
reftgnation of the President, which raay be for Â»
term of nearly four years.r>-itf Elc&ors will no doubt turn their attentiao
tr a citizen of the firfl-rate merit for * Ration, which
on several contingencies, may becom* that of chief
P m-gijlrat* of tha United States for so long a period.
The two persons who have been principally nam
ed in converfatiansare Thomas Pinckney of South
Carolina, and Aaron Burr ef New-York. The
former it supported by thÂ« friends of Mr. Adams,
the latter by those of Mr. Jefcifon.
In order to direst your choice asiar as my inform
Â«tion goes, I will make you acquainted with theref
pe&ive merits of those candidates.
Mr. Burr, at present a member of the Senate
of the United States from New-Yi>rk, has been al
ways considered as opposed to the constitution, and
has i-lways opposed in the Senate the measures of
administration underPrefident Walhington : his time
in the Senate being nearly elapsed, and having little
profpeft of a re ele&ion from that federal date,
Â», Mr. Burr was put *p as a Hate feaator at the la*
state ele&ion in June, and run on the anti-federal tic
ket, which being defeated by a two to
one by the federal paity, ht could not even get in
to the state legislature. ,
By a law of the United States the Vice Presi
dent is to a <ft as a commissioner for managing the
monies of the finking fund, which duty necefTaiily
involves some commanication with the Betni of the
United States in which the public monies arc depo
sited, and to which rtfort is sometimes necefTary for
anticipations, when the public revenue cannet meet
the public demands.
But the ill-tempered proceeding of the Dire&ors
ia a late unfriendly measure towards that gentleman
will probably excite on his part an hofility towrds
that institution, which might eventually be in a Vice
President very detrimental to the public interests.
1 Mr. Pinckney, the alfociate of Mrr Adams, on
the federal ticket, is a virtadys, enlightened, and
patriotic citizen, independent in his fortune as well as
in his principles. His approbation of the measures
of Wafhiogten's administration, bin attachment to
the federal eonftuntionfâtiiÂ» l"i foi
pendehce of his country are all well known. His
diplomatic talents and his persevering zeal for our
national prefpenty have been folly evinccd in his
conduct in England and his treaty with Spain. In
his difpofitior, he is mild, but firm,conciliatory,
without facrificing etfential principles, prudent with
out timidity.
Such are the candidates fellow citiiens ; can yÂ»u
hesitate in your choice ?

Rejp-Bable Fellow Citizens,
THE sequel of the 34th letter of Mr. Adaihs,
remains to be considered. We have seen, that in
â¢ommenting upon certain republican sentiments of
Marchamont Nedham, Mr. Adams did not fei*e
the oecafion to panegyrize representative or elective
government. He fays it may anfwervery well, but
that it is a hazardous experime/A, that filch experi
ments have bemi made before, and are known al
wajf* to hav* enArj fn .gaje.m3y, Sr.-. 1-I:r.r
have universally preferred " chance" or hereditary
rulers to fuel), as they have procured by their pad
elective experiments. Thus in truth does he throw
clouds over our profpefls under elr&ive govern
ments, when discoursing upon the opinions of ie
publican theorids. Thus docs he abandon the de
fence of the cardinal principle of our conditutions, '
and thus, under the cover of a defence of three divi- 'â 
Jions of power, does lie run into the paths, that lead :
to the oppofttt principle of hereditary power. This !
is ns tortured misrepresentation of the paflagts re
ferred to. We despise such treatment of refpefta
ble men, or of important fubjefts.. But how dif
ferently does Mr. Adams condufl his dlfcouifes,
when l>e is observing upon writers, who arc not, in
our sense, republican authors. He Rates the ideas
of Polybius and Plato, who both contemplated he
reditary power as parts of theit systems. He gives
the precise conceptions of Polybius in the follow
ing words. Â«< It is customary to eftablifli three
â¢ ' forts of governments ; kingly government, ariflo
j M cracy, and democracy : upon which one may very
" properly afit them, whether they lay these down
" as the only forms Â»f government, or as the heft ;
" tor in bÂ»ih cases they seem to be in an error, (free
" it is in an ift (I, that the heft Jorm of government it
" 'f"" wb'cb 'S compounded of all three. This is
" founded not only in reaftn but in experience, - '
'â¢ Lycurgus having set the example of this form of
" government in the institution of the Lacedce
" manian commonwealth." This Lacedaraonian
commonwealth was the very fame mixed monarchy
noticed in the close of our firft paper. After ha
ving thus briefly and precisely Hated the political
creed of Polybius, and afier giving that of the dif
fufive Plato in a mote diffufive manner, Mr. Adams
fays, in his 34th letter, Â« let t:s procctf then to
make a few obiervations upon the idifceurfei of
" and Polybius." " Plato, 1 "/ fays Mr. A
daras, (p'.209, Philadelphia & London edition l"has
" fuflkiently afTcttcd the honotir g/f the laws, and
" the necessity of proper guardians of them ; but
has no where delineated the various orders of
" guardians, and the necessity of a balance between
1,1 thsm : he has, nevertheless, gi/en us premises.
Â« from whence the absolute necejjity of fueh orders j
* and equipnifes maybe inferred; he has (hewn I
" how naturally every simple species of government
degenerates. Ihe arillocracy, or ambitious re- j
C- ; >ub, ' c becomes immediately an oligarchyâ what
Â«* (hall be done to prevent it ? Place two guardi
, ? n3 , ot ' he laws wa, ch the aristocracy one, J
-in the fhapeof a iing, [ 1)0 t a chief magistrate

Â« in the lhape of a democratical afTembly, on the
other ( u!e - T he 3rifto Â« , racy, become an oligar
chy, changes into a democracyâhow shall it Be
Â« prevented ? By giving the natural ariflacracy in
Â« society us rational and just weight, and by gi T .
Â« ing it a regal power to appeal to, against the mad
, tuft of the Democracy becomes a tyran
"yâ.'!OW 51 th ' S be P rcven tcd ? By giving it
an able independent ally in an arijlocratical as.
â ,th , w J h Â° m ma 7 ""'te again ft the un .
jult and illegal of any oae ff,ao."
i Here we fee, that Mr, Adams having got a
i al theme to discourse upon, does not run intÂ» duufcW
f about hereditary government(,ash6 had befoie done
in regard to ele&ive governments. The royal go
- vernments mud then appear to blm free from all
i caufc of doubt. He does not throw out thefmal
; left eaution against theni. But he takes pains to
, (hew that the regal and arijlocratical powers are
proper and necessary checks upon the madness of the
- people. Let us a/k ourselves however where and
- when such a government has been exhibited. Where
and when were a king and nobles each having a tc
e gative combined, with a real reprefenta'.ion of the
- people ?No where but in bocks. How then can
I it be thus decidedly affirmed from unexecuted' the
f ories, that the three would work so well together
f as our excellent government has done. For a new
: government, organized in a storm, in a country
, half vvilderriefa, placed over a various people, in a
time Â»f unexampled and extreme difficulties, aâ 
â¢ midi a belligerent and infuriated woild, having to
Â» druggie with the arrearages of many years, em- !
barrafiied by difputc* with two neighbouring pow
ers, and by Indian wars, to carry us through with
fafety and prosperity is more than aay mixed mo.
: narchy ever accomplished. Let it be here remem
r bered, that it is the si'sl genuine representative go
t vernment the world had seen in 1789. Human
â¢ uHairs do not appear to admit of more success and
r advantages under any^form of gbvernment. This!
ought to operate as the mod encouraging induce
ment to persevere on our present ground. We ought
not to discourage or alarm the people by commit
ting the mofl dangerous and tempting situation to any,
who doubt or disbelieve the practicability of our fy
dem, and who may incline to realize the favorite
theory of their maiurejl years in themfelvet and their

e NEW-YORK, November 15.
MASSACHUSETTS.
e We have returns from a number of towns in
n Hampfhirc county, by which it appears, that gen.
Shepard or Samuel Henfhaw, (both federal) wilt
â¢r be elected rcpreientative in congress ; and that W.
<â¢ Lyman, the pfefent member, will have but few
y votes. In many towns, his nanne is not among
a the candidates. In the fame diitrift, Ebenezer
i- Hunt (federal) appears to have mod of the votes
0 1 for eleflor.
1- | We have averted, that for a government to order
â - I its citizens to wear a cockade, without law, is as
h tyrannical, as to requin its ciiizens to fnhfcribe a
>. ; tcft aft, or take an oath, without law. Mr. Bache
i- J with his democratic logic* abufc, ridicules the po
j-1 fition.
n Pray, citizen, is it not as completely theft to
d j Heal a shilling, as to (leal a dollar ? The effects on
is j the. loser are different; but the principle in the thief,
;â  the fame. So it is as perftS despotism to wear a
it cockade, without- law, as it is to guillotine him,
t- without latv. But, in regard to the tell law of
r, Great Britainj ahd the order of the Directory of
f. France to fay citizen and wear a ockads, there is an
te essential differenceâThe test, in Great Britain, is
ir a law, enacted by Parliament: the erder of the
Directory is an aft the Executive, without law,
and therefore, mnjl tyrannical of the two. IndeeÃ,
such a (Iretch of power in Great-Britain, could not
be exercised, without risking the head of the kin*.
The EngJifli would not bear such an aft of despot
ism in tiit E*#cutive.

been consulted, together with his moderate charges, will se
cure their future favors and recommendation.
>1 He now begs leave to inform them and the public at large
that his spacious and commodious premises, erected for the
purpofet above described are open for the reception of pupils
of either sex, who wifli to be inftru&ed in the Art of Riding,
h and the right method of governing their horses, so as to ride
them with eale, elegance, and fafetyâtheir horses will be
carefully and expeditiously broke, for every purpose, and
made obedient to the will ot the riders ; the natural powers
which are (hut up in them, will be unfolded by art, calling
forth uniformity of motion, and giving to that noble animal
all thole beauties of a&k>n which providence ha> so bounti
lully bellowed on them.
Also, at his hospital, every di former to which the horse is
liable will be treated according to the rules of art, confirmed
by long and repeated experience.
The utility of the above inUitution has never been qoeftion

capital and beautiful F called
PROSPEC T-H I L L,
Situated within one quarter of a mile from the Brandywine
Mills, and half a mile from the borough of Wilmington.
HPHE dwelling house is built of llone, twt high,
â * genteely hnifhed, and contains four handsome rooms on
a floor, besides an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
c ellars It is generally thought to command the mofl a
greeable profpeft of the Delaware, from the source of that I
liver to the Capes* This profpeft ia greatly embellilhed by o
a full view of a vÂ»ft body ot meadow, through which the n
Corifliana and Brandywine creeks are seen winding in beau- a
tiful meanders. Near the house are a Kitchen, a spacious
. flone liable and hayloft, a barn, a carriage house, railic
houfe, <scc. and a well of as pute water as any on the conti
nent. The gardeu contains an acre and quarter of land, a
bounding with fruit, and particularly with peqch trees, of
the very best kiud, brought from Maryland, and in full bear- .
ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a young, apple
orchard begining to bear, and leyeral old trees that produce M
abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental trees, in 3
great numbers. The farm consists of near sixty acres of land, n
of good ouality, and clear of incumbrances, except taxes, k
twenty of which are now in excellent clover and timothy,
and ten more will be ready tor lowing next spring. A re-
fidence of nearly 8 years has convinced the fubferiber that b
the situation is remarkably healthy. The great pofljoad d
from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within seventy h
yards of the house. In a word, the beauties and conveni- j-,
ence of this situation cannot be enumerated in an advertise- h
ment, and when examined, will probably command the at- p
tention of any perfbn who isdefirous of living at one of the
moil elegant country feats on the continent. The pure hafer
may enter on the premiss next spring, or perhaps, this fall,
if application be immediately made to Doaor NICHOLAS Â®
W/iY, in Philadelphia, to Doctor WH ARTON, on the "
premises, or, iu his ablence, to Mr. GEORGÂ£ TItUITT, in tJ
Wilmington. w

Mr.Thomas F. Brooke, (in Prince George's county) to
whom he was hired, a NEGRO MAN, named CjESAR ; -
33 years of age; about 5 feet Bor 9 inches high; well 2
made ;of a yellowilh complexion; a little pockmarkcd: 4
has, when spoken to, rather a down look, and submissive -
tone of voice: the clothes he had before he abfeonded 6
were of plain, such m labouring Negroes usually wear,
but these he may probably exchange for others : he will ii
doubtless endeavour to pass for a freeman, having, as I e
have been informed, alTumed the name of Butler: I have f<
reason to believe that he went to Baltimore, from whence ti
he is said to have gone to some part of the Sufquehannah, ii
probably with a view of getting to Pennsylvania. A n
reward as Thirty Dollars will be given to the person who
may take him and so secure him in some jail that I may c
get him again, if taken in this state, and Fifty dollars if n
taken out of the state, and if brought home or secured in f<
