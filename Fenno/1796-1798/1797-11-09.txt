futr th: Gazette of States. ,
TO THE PUBLIC.
Continued from Monday's Gazette.
Dr. Currie in his " Information refpejft
ing Dr. Ruth's coridudt" &c. proceeds 111
the following manner :
" Those acquainted with the causes and
laws of contagion thought him insane.
" At other titties he promised a removal
of the infectious effluvia, with which he af
fcrted the whole atmosphere was loaded, as
soon as a heavy rain fliould fall. An opin
ion as groun'iefs as any that ever was gene
rated in a whimsical brain."
Tlie following extract from a letter writ
ten'by Mr- Clarkfon, then mayor of the ci
ty, to the mayor of the eity of New-York,
is a proof.that Dr. Rulll was not miltaken
in hi' 3 prediction of the effedts of rain in
checking the fever of 1793.
" The refrefhing rain which fell the day
before yesterday, though light, and the
cool weather which hath succeeded, appear
to have given a check to the prevalence of
the disorder ; of this we have fatisfactory
proof ; as well in the decrease of the fune
rals, as in the applications for removal to the
hQfpital."
There was no rifl: in this prediction.â
tnftances of the similar effects of rain upon
bilious fevers are to be met with in many of
the writers Upon epidemics. Eveu Dr.
Currie has fubferibed to it, as the following
extradt from his history of the diseases of the
United States will (hewâSee p. 105. â
" Fewer diseases prevail in Autumn, when
the ground is frequently refrejhed by flow
ers, and the ponds are rcpleniihed with
â water, than in dry ones." We also
fee the fame idea held out in page
64. of his 2d pamphlet on the Synochus
Idteroidesâ" Nor does it (fays he, mean
ing this fever) agree in its effedt with the
miasmata, which arise from putrifying sub
stances, or from a tnarfhy foil in any one cir
cutnftauce, except being extiriguilhed by
Cold and frofty, and perhaps rainy weather."
In a late letter also to Dr. Latimer, he has
asserted the fame. It appears from these
quotations, that Dr. Carrie's brain is not
only whimsical, but versatile too, and that in
a very high degree.
The next charge against Dr. Ru(h by Dr.
C. is as follows.
Â« In speaking of his exploits in a letter
addressed to Dr. Rodgers, dated Odtober
3cK after accusing most of the physicians of
the city of ignorance and obstinacy, he adds,
Â« by means of the remedies before mention
tioned, I think I have been the unworthy
inftrumeut in the hands of a kind provi
dence of recovering more than 99 out of a
100 of my patients before my late indispo
sition from the want of bleeding and purg
ing. Since tlie 10th of September, I have
found bleeding in additiou to the mercurial
purges necessary in 19 aafes out of 20. At
firft I found the loss of 10 or 12 ounce?
fnfficicnt to subdue the pulse, but I have
been obliged gradually as the season advanc
ed to encreafe the quantity to 60, 70 and 80
ounces."
" So much was the doftor about this pe
riod possessed witjÂ» the notion that he was
the only man of common sense existing, that
he not only refufed to consult with any but
hisformerpupiliwhofubmittedtoobey his dic
tates, that he rudely intruded hi* advice up
on other people's patients ; he also appoint
ed two illiterate negro men and Cent them in
to all the alleys and bye-places in the city,
with orders to bleed and give his sweating
purges as he empirically called them, to all
they should find sick without regard to age,
sex or constitution. And bloody and dir
ty work they made among the poor misera
ble creatures that fell in their way."
As a reply to this refufal to consult with
Dr. C. and the other physicians who gave
bark and wine in the yellow fever, I beg
leave to give Dr. R'a own reasons for it, in
his own wordsâ(from p. 359. of his Essay
on tbe yellow fever.) â" One thing in my
eondudt towards these gentlemen may re
quire jnftification ; and, thatis, my refufing
to consult with them. A Mahometan .and
a jew might as welTattempt to worftiip the
Supreme Being in the fame temple, and
through the medium of the fame ceremonies,
as two physicians of cppofite principles and
pra&ice, attempt to confer about the life of
the fame patient. What is done in conse
quence of such aegociations (for they are
not confutations) is the ineffedtual result of
neutralised opinions ; and wherever they
take place, would be cenfidered as the effedt
of a criminal compidt between physicians,
to assess the property of their patients, by a
fhameful prostitution of the diftates of their
consciences. Besides I early discovered that
it was impoflible for me by any reasonings,
to change the pradice of some o( my bre
thren. Humanity was therefore on the fide
of leaving them to themselves."
Dr. Currie's charge against the two wor
thy black men, Absalom Jones and Richard
Allen, is fully refuted by their great success
in curing the fever after molt of the physi
cians were confined by it. It is true, these
men like Dr. C. had not the advantage of
a regular university education ; but like the
Dr they were capable of following the in
ftruaions of Dr. Ruth. The treatment of
the disease by depleting remedies was sim
ple and intelligible to common capacities.
Hundreds cured themselves by means of
bleeding and purging, who could not have
the benefit of being attended by a phyficiao.
Let us next fee how much truth there is
in the following assertions.
" The contemplation of his own felf-cre
ated ccnfequence, the hurry of buflnefs, the
novelty and solemn afpedt of the surround
ing scenes, had certainly a very extraordjna
ryÂ°effedt upon his imagination and impaired
liia judgment.
" I knew feteral that he terrified into
chilly fits, some into relapses, and some in- t
to convulsions, by flopping them in the street
and declaring they had the feverâYou've
got it ! you've got ! was his usual falntati- :
on upon feeing any one with a pale counte- t
nance. I have been assured that he pronoun- r
ced to Dr. Glcntworth, that he would be a c
dead man it he would not fubrait to more f
bleeding, after he had reduced him almoit 1
to death's door by the viuletiee of his reme- 1
dies.* Two other physicians bwng called 1
in, thought otherwise, and the Dodtor re
covered without any more loss of the vital
fluid, notwithstanding this alarming and po- 1
fitive prognostication. I
" His pronouncing Mr. Michael Connor 1
to be infedted with the yellow fever, when
just recovered from the agu* and fcyer, oc- <
eafioned a relapseâThe fame gentleman as- <
cribes the loss of his amiable daughter to 1
the draltic operation of his mercurial purges. 1
" When applied to by Mr. Chancellor to ]
visit a patient with Dr. Hodge, he advised 1
him to dismiss Dr. H. for he was a bark and
wine Doctor, and would do him more harm 1
than good.
( * " If you will not fubmitto my â¢voice,fays
lis, fetlleyoyr affairs, for you have a dropsy 1f
the train, and willfoon It a dead man.")
Why has not Dr. C. given one instance
of this " extraordinary effedt upon his
(Dr. Ruth's) imagination" and of tbe im
paired state of his judgment ? He undoubt
edly would have done it had it been in his
power.
As totheaffertion of 'â¢ you'vegotit! you've
got it! I remark, that after the icth of
September, Dr. Ruth believed, and events
proved him to be right, that we had no other
disease in the city but the yellow fever , it
was of the greatest confequenceto inculcate
this opinion, as it led the sick early to ap
ply for medical aid, and physicians to an
early use of the proper remedies for thispre
dominating disease. Dr. Rufli's efforts to
enforce this idea, were rendered more np
ceffary, by the following falfe and most ab
surd publication by Dr. Currie of Septem
ber 17th in the Federal Gazette of Sept.
20th, 1793, and which he bimfelf'm the (hort
space of 15 days contradicted most unequi
vocally ; and was obliged to submit his judg"
ntent in this inltanceto that of the mail whom
he had opposed so (hort a time before.
" Mr. Brown,
f It affords me particular fatisfadtion,
that I now have it ifi my power to inform
my fellow citizens, that the progress of the
infedtious fever has greatly abated, and
that with a little longer perfevrrance in
avoiding intercourse with the infedted, as
far as humanity will permit, paying at the
fame time proper attention to fumigating
and ventilating the hntifes, clothing, and
utensils from whence the sick have been re
moved, or where they have been confined/
the infection which has proved so morul
will mofl certainly be entirely eradieat d
in a few days; The best method for effei t
ing this, is contained in a late publicati >n
by the learned Dr; Ruffel.
" I have made the JlriÃeJl enquiry rt
fpedting the number at present confined by
the genuine yellow fever, and am convinced
that it does not exceed 40 Â»r 50 in the
whole city
" There is, however, another formida
ble disease prevalent, by which, / have
reafbn to believe, there are above a thovfand
ill at this time.
" The disease T mean is the common re
mittent or fall fever. This fever, however,
is ntit infedtious.
" When the remitting fever attacks per
sons not fully recovered from the effedts of
the influenza, (which is also itill prevalent
here) it occafious a violent determination of
the blood tp the head, accompanied with
acute pain, a redness of the eyes, with a
faint tinge of yellowâ-the pulse is quick
and the (kin hot. This is the disease which
is so much under the power of blood-letting
and purging ; and is as different from the
infedtious, or genuine yellow fever, as the
fun is from the moon, or light from dark
ness.
" In the fall fever, which succeeds the
influenza, the eye is sprightly, though red,
the face turgid and slushed :âwhereas, in
the genuine yellow fever, the eye is dull and
inanimate, and fuffufed with a dusky brown,
the face pule, (hrunk, and.cadaverous, ai
med from the firft attack. It is in the re
mitting fever, with the violent affeftion of
the head, that the mode of treatment ad
vised by Dr. Ruth can only be proper i and
not in the infedtious or yellow fever. On
the contrary, in the yellow fever, it cannot
fail of being certain death. In the yellow
' fever, the means recommended by Dr.
Kuhn and Dr. Stevens, are the most effec
tual, and the only ones that can be relied
on, with such a variation as circumstances,
and the period of the disease may indicate.
" It is in the fall fever, circumstanced as
already described, that there is fafitty in
visiting and attending the sick, because this
fever is not contagious. Can there be the
fame fafety in visiting patients ponfined with
the genuine yellow fever, which made its
appearance in Water-street the third of
[ August last ? Let those judge who have had
opportunities of feeing its ravages ! Is that
fever, in which the bond of union is imme
diately dissolved between the solids and flu
ids, and. where the purple current ifflies
from every pore, the fame as that for which
Dr. Rufli diredts bleeding and purging ?
â  and can there be fafety in visiting perfnus
so affedted ? Have we all got the contagion
of the yellow fever in our bodies, only
* waiting for some exciting cause to put it
. into a&ion ? By no -means. The disease,
which Dr. Rulh-calls the yellow fever, and
; of which Dr. P. lays he has cured such
numbers by the new method, is only the
fall fever, operating on persons who have
been previously affeSed by the influenza.
" It is time the veil fliould be withdrawn
from your eyes, my fellcw citizens!
I Wm. Currie."

The following is his own aft of fclf-rtja- j -
tation ;
" oSober zd, I 793. ' '
" All the physicians engaged in praftice J
at prefVnt in tbe city, agree with Dr. Rush ,
that blood-letting and copious"purging are j
requisite in the cvrre of the prevailing epi-; 1
demic, in every cafe where- inflammatory j ;
fyniptams are evident, and that the dispute â¢ 1
hitherto has been about the name of the di- ! 1
feafe, rather than the proper mode of treat- I
ment. 1 1
W. CITRRIE." It
The effefts of- this itrft publication will ' 1
long be remembered and deplored by the ci
tizens of Philadelphia, It contributed very
much to ii\creafe the mortality of the fever.
To obviate itsdeftruftive influence upon the
citizens, Dr. Rush took pains in his inter
course.with the Ock, to itnprcfs upon them
that they cpuld have no other disease tli3n
the prevailing epidernic, by which means he
produced an immediate application for medi
cal advice, 'and thereby saved many lives.
Dr. Rush early discovered further, a differ
ence between a passive and an aitlne state of
the disease : He perceived that it was pof
lible for the contagion to exist is a quiescent
state in thefyftem, and to pass out of it with
out doing any harm, provided the person
thus avoided what he called the ex
citing cauies of the disease, such as fatigue,
heat, cold, intemperance and the like. The
signs ef the prefencs of the contagion in the
body were, a red eye, a fallow (not a pale)
face, as Dr. C. asserts,âa quick and full
pulse, a want of sleep or night sweats.
When these symptoms occurred, Dr. Rush
never failed to warn his fellow-citizens of
their danger, End to advise thtm to avoid
the causes that might excite the disease into
aftion. By these pieans Jam sure he pre
vented the disease in many people. Those
who know Dr. Rush, will not believe that he
ever obtruded his advice upon any body in a
manner that was either rude or alarming ;
and those who attend to these remarks up
on Dr. Currie's. publication, will not hesi
tate in disbelieving tfjat Df. Rush terrified a
single perfpn into Wlapfes'or eopvulfions.
I cannot help addfhglierei that by pursu
ing the above humane and ratiosal praftice
of Dr. Rush, in 1793, Â£>r. Caldwell has
affuied me that he has good reason to believe
that he has saved many lives, and prevented
the formation of the disease in many instan
ces during the prevalence of our late epide
mic.

Amidst that wfrrtunutc variety of opinions con
cerning the natuieand the best mode of treating
the late prevailing fever, I trust I also have a right,
jfjCr an extÂ«nfive and fuccefsful practice of forty
ta ve years on this continent, to offer mine. I take
thÂ« liberty,-therefore, without fearing to incur the
imputation o vanity, to state a few fÂ«i<3j, the rc
fult of my personal observation and experience.
From the iÂ»th day of Jaly to the 13d of OAo
bor, I have had under my care (ifty-feven patients
(exclusive df several poor perfom, wliofe names
are not on my hooks} many, of whom were afflic
ted with the caifling diseases of the fcafon, or the
prevailing fdverj : there were also some cases of
dysenteries or fluxes. Oat of the whole number
I loft but two. One of these had the black vomit*
r ing some days before I was called in : the other
when convalescing, was, by an uncommon and
nnexpe3ed change of weather, from extreme heat
So unseasonable cold, seized with an ague; and,
as he lay in a garret, and the north fide of the
house was very open, and moreover the family re
siding in the lower part entirely out of hearing, I
. canno*. harbor a doubt, that he died fur want of
some warm covering. For, agreeably to oiy di
rections prcvioefly to the sudden change in the
air, he . laid only under a single ihect and light
counterpane.
Though I do not pretend to deny that venesec
tion, when managed with prudence and caution,
may fomttimes he necessary, yet lam free to de
clare, that in not one of these sixty seven cases,
did I ever use the lancet; and lam bold to assert,
for I have strong reasons to believe (from some
circumstances which have, fallen within ray own
knowledge) that not a few have died the victims
of too frequent and too copious blood-letting.â
It may be, likewise, not improper to remark, that
I adnainifteied Mercury or Calomel very fpaVing
i ly, having noticed many tad great inconveniences
| from too liberal an use of it, such at violent grip
ing, tenefmus, faliV-ition, and other disagreeable
and painful concomitants; and I found the milder
1 cathartics to answer every gÂ«od purpose, without
exhausting the strength and spirits of the fubjeA.
As to a putrid or real malignant fiver, accortf
r ing to the idea I have of one (and I run but little
rifquc of conrradi&ion when I fay. that
I have seen, if not more, at lea ft as much of
1 it as any other pra&itioner On the continent) 1 dlf
1 covered no such thing in the early stages of the
. disorder. That the cases were bilious at firft, and
r afterwards, from mifmanagrment and a multipli
city of other causes, put on the putrid type. I in
tend (hortly, "it it please Providence to spare my
â¢ health and preserve my life, to substantiate by
[ proofs which cannot fa 1, I think, of fatisfying and
convincing every unenot blinded by .ignorance, or
' euflaved by system and bigotry : at the fame time,
I shall take occasion alfÂ« of recommending such
' means of prevention an'd cure, as will in my opin
-1 ion, if adopted, save in future, under the bleff
-1 ing of God, the lives of many of my fellow-crea

The Executive Directory to the Citizens of
Paris.
Citizens,
" Royalty has just threatened the confti
lution by a new attack. After having for
a whole year fbaken by their dark manoeuv
res all the foundations of the Republic, they
thought that they were fufficiently powerful
to confiiminate ita deilruftion. They tho't
themselves fufficiently protested to venture
to aim its firft attack against the supreme
depufitories of the Executive Direftory.â
Arms were daily diftributtd to the conspir
ators; and all Paris knows that one of the
distributors was arreHed with a great num
ber of bonds, upon which he had already
delivered a great number of firelocks. Cards
stamped Legislative Body, end markeif with
an R, were circulated in order to serve as
rallying signs to the conspirators, charged
with the office of maffacreing the Direftory
and the deputies faithful to the cause of the
people.
" A great number of emigrants, cut
throats of Lyons, and brigands of La Ven
dee, attrafted hither by the intrigues of
royalifm, and the tender interest publickly
lavished upon them without fear, attacked
the posts which furrouadcd the executive
direftory; but the vigilance of the govern
ment, and the chiefs of the armed force,
fruftrated their criminal efforts.
" The executive direftory is about to lay
before the nation the authentic documents
which it has collefted concerning the man
oeuvres of the Royalists. You will shudder
with horror, citizens, at the plots entered
into against the fafety of every one of yon,
against your property, against your deafeft
rights, against your molt sacred polfeffious
and you may calculate the extent of the cal
amities from which in future you can alone
he preserved by the maintenance of the con
ftitutian.
So many triumphs had already crowned
the eftabliihment of this constitution. Your
generals and your intrepid defenders had
surrounded it with their immortal trophies.
At the fame of their viftories, agriculture
and commerce relumed their activity, pub
lic credit by degrees recovered, confidence
and security began to spring up in every
heart, and this is the moment which has
been pitched upon to re-kindle your animo
sities, "to propagate superstition, to re-or
ganize the power of fanaticifm,to sow (Joubt
and alarms in every bread by opening' new
avenue* for the return of emigrants, to (hake
thÂ« guarantee of public contrasts: to give
the figrtal of civil war, and to retard by the
hopes with which foreign nations were in
spired, the so much wished conclusion of
peace with <3ur external foes, hoaortrable &
solid, worthy of the triumphs of the French
people and of their generosity. 'No, you
will not lose the fruits of your long facrifi
ees, you will rife indignantly against those
base emigrants, the authors of our calami
ties, of all our agitations, of all our Offer
ings. You will arm yourselves to flop their
designs, and to defend against their attacks
your perfons,your property and your rights.
But beware of agitations. Do not disgrace
the mod glorious of causes by the excesses
of an anarchyjuftly abhorred. Refpeft pro
perty. Let not an ill direfted patriotic im
pulse throw you into a fatal confufion. O
bey no voice but that of the avowed chiefs
appointed by the government. Rely upon
the vigilance of your magistrates and upon
the exertions of your legislators, who have
remained faithful to the cause of the people.
Patriotism will resume all its energy, the
constitution all its glory, and every citizen
will enjoy, in their fulleft extent, liberty,

It seems that citizen Ramel, commandant
of the guard of the French legislative body,
addrefll-d a letter ta the councils of elders
and 500, afluring thtm of their fafety, and
of the attachment of the grenadiers to the
duties incumbent on them : But, to ! when
general Moulin advanced With his twp can
non against the hall, these fame faithful de
fenders of the legiflatur'e, these patriot gre
nadiers, not only deserted theff colours, but
joined the adailants, delivered up'their own
commander Ramel, aided in arresting the
devoted members, and exhibited' one addi
tional proof, that no reliance can be placed
upon hireling mereenaries in the trying hour
of danger and dismay. The consequence
was the seizure of the brave Pichegru, and
such of his virtuous colleagues, as, by their
firmnefs in refifti.ng the mafqued tyrants, had
become obnoxious to their resentment, and
objefts deflined to be immolated at the
shrine of personal and party animosity !
What freedom can exist in a country
where the legislature is daily fubjeft to the
parricidal violence of a sanguinary fadtion ?
Opinion should be free as airâNo man
should be liable to be fevzed, imprisoned and
hanijljcd, for exprefling his sentiments
where the poflibility of this exists, all liber
ty is utterly loft What would be said,
if the democratic fadtipn in Congress had
wheedled a body of the Philadelphia militia
into their meafures,/eized the advocates for
the British treaty, imprifoncd and banijhed
themâSaid ! why, the Jacobins would not
certainly have approbated itâbut the friends
of rational libertyâthe coolâreflecting
part of the publicâthe men to be depended
on, would have stood aghast !âTheir firft
sensations would have been those of surprise
and astonishmentâbut the monsters would
have been taught that among people ac
quainted with their rights, and the necessity
of preserving aconftitution they had labour
ed to ereÂ£t and eftablilh, very different
measures were neceflary to bring offenders,
or presumed offenders to justice.
The present state of affairs in France af
fords a pretty good criterion for determin
â¢ ing the state of public opinioa in the Unit
ed StatesâAll those who declare in favor
of the vile usurpers of ? power arbitrary and
unwarranted, would not hesitate at approv
ing the fame rascally measures among usâ
But those who think justly, cannot fail to
deprecatethe horrors of the anarchical and
despotic violence exercised against the mode
rate, peaceably-disposed, patriotic members
of the directory and legislative councils.
By this day's Mail.
NEW-YORK, November 8.
The papers which we shall continue to
give, and on which the disclosure of the
plans of the royalists were said to be founded
appear to be exceedingly obfeure. At any
rate, they da fiot appear, to us, to be fuf
ficiently explanatory ps their views, to have
warranted a condemnation of tjie many per
sons arretted on them, without fomt form at
least of a regular trial. To those, howe
ver, who look back to the manner in which
every former unfuccefsfnl party has been o
verthrownin Paris, the mode in which the
last have been disposed of, will not excite
any daggering surprize.
Madame Orleans has obtained permission
to pass into Spain.
That another, and another regeneration is
not to be confined to the limits of Paris,
may be learned from the following article in
one of the immaculate, and unprofcribed
French papers:
" 1200 Distinguished Emigrants will be
arretted and tried in 24 hours. The repre
sentatives and other accused persons who
have.fled, will be tried for contumacy.
The eledtions influenced by Louis 18, are
declared puH; and the commander in chief
of the army of Italy, is ordered to avenge
the eaufe of the patriots who were murdered
in the South. The division of Maffena has
for that purpose marched to Lyons, and
Joubert's division to Marseilles. All the
conftitutcd authorities and administrations

PARIS, September 5.
Declaration of Duverne DepreflTe, or 1311-
nant, annexed to the secret register of the
Directory, 11 Ventofe, sth year.
FIRST DECLARATION.
" Citizens,
<Â» I do not diflemble that, in beginning
this Written detail, I am about to put into
your hands that of my own condemnation.
But although I am far from being mfeufi
fible to my own personal isitereft, I am so
fullyperfuaded that it I*9 n far different motive
which has determined you to take a step very
difficult to be misinterpreted, which I shall
not hesitate to undertake, although I had
not to encourage me the engagement which
you have contra&ed.
" Many attempts have been made fine*
the revolution to restore the throne ; all of
them have failed, but mod of them have
cost the lives of a great number of men of
1 >both parties. Nothing lias difcotvraged the
rfiyaliits, and hitherto there have been so
many reasons tojuftify their hopes, that we
ought not to be surprised if by the fide of
one conspiracy extinguished, another should
arise the more dangerous, because to its own
refonrcjs it adds the experience of the er
rors which have occ.fioned the ruin of others.
I fay dangerous, not becauf# that I think
any coqfpirpcy would overthrow the estab
lished government, but because I believe that
fotne one may be found combining fufficient
means to encourage even an open attack,
aVrd then the blood of Frenchmen would
flow in torrents (hed by the hands of French
men. It is to prevent, as far as lies in my ;
power, the return o/ these scenes of desola
tion, that I have formed the design ofeom- i
municatwg all the threads ofthe conspiracy ]
at the head of which I am placed, to lead ]
you into the track of those which may fuc- <
ceed ; in fine, to diflipate id such a manner <
all the resources of the royalists that they !;
may be compelled even to abandon their j t
hopes. I betray the cause of royalty j I t
know it, but 1 am convinced I serve the 1
cause of those Frenchmen who are attached j i
to that cause by destroying the foundation r
of their chimerical hopes : and, if I do not f
impose upon myfelf, this conduft will not , '
deprive me of any just title to the esteem of r
those who (hall decide without paflion. \ c
" I will not fatigue your attention by a | e
longer preamble. I have {aid thus much , t
only to juilify to myfelf an adtion which I | t
think courageous, which perhaps may be si
generally regarded as an aft of treachery. I r
am about to enter upon the fubjedt, and I
will speak as if I had been the only agent of a
the king at Paris. It-is two years since I p
undertook the management of his intereils. ii
From that period I was aware that the roy
alists could have no real constancy, but when ei
united round a comrtion centre they aft by 1
preconcerted movements. From that period b
I exerted every effort to lead to that centre p
of unity all'the chiefs of La Vendee and of t;
Brittany ; all the' agents foattered through a
the different departments that I could dif- p
cover, who pretended to aft for the fame
objedt, and who all pursued it by contra- c<
didtory means. I went into Britanny, into
La Vendee. I went to Switzerland, where
an English minister resides, specially charged
to second the royalists. I went to the army i
of the prince of Conde, and saw the king.
At length I made a journey tft England,
where I explained myfelf with the count d(
D'Artois and the English ministers. No- oi
thing less would do, in Order to prevail on dt
every individual to renounce the plans which
he himfelf diredted, the private scheme which ta
he had adopted, to put an end to the ani- nt
rnofities and the divifioni which reigned in ev
the party; and in this last refpedt I never a
could have produced a durable effedt in La kr
Vendee and Brittany. I was also far from oh
eonfidering their fubmifiion as an unfortunate mi
event. It served eur cause because it en a- tai
bled us to develope entirely a plan more wife lai
than those which had preceded) on this very
account more wife, because it embraced at on
once the whole of France, and because it
excluded every partial movement, but that da
which should repder us matters of Paris by pr
overthrowing the government. fla
" Such is the plan which had been ap- of
proved by the pretender, who alone was ac- de
quainted with all its details. The English la\
mmiftry, the French princes, likewise adopt- th
ed so much of the plan as was communicated bu
to them. The objeft was, to make the cri
political and military movements go hand in da
hand. of
" to be dividedinto two agen- ha
cies. alv
" The one, which comprehends the pro- cai
vinces of Franche Compte, the Lyonnoife, eyi
Fores, Auvergne, and the whole of the pr<
South is to be entrusted to M. Precy.â fir:
The other, which extends over all the reft ter
of France, is to be directed by the agents at jor
Paris. Thcfe two agencies shall reciprocal- the
ly inform each other of their situation by a wit
vegular and adtive eorrefpondence. No hyi
movement is to be attempted by the one, if nol
the other is not previously apprised of it ing
and if it it not prepared to second its ope- fufc
ration. &c
" The twoagenciesfhallhave a dire ft com- 1
munication with the King, and with the a- to
gents of the British government. This last tril
having only two objedts, the firft, the de- and
mand of afTiftatice, and secondly, in its ap- pea
plication, the agents are to render them
felvet independent of the inftrudtions which to
might be given by the English. The se
cond objeft of the English eorrefpondence end
lhall be to give them every intelligence tend- pov
ing to serve the cause ; but never to facih- thr
tate to them the means of seizing any of our eve
maritime* places, and in general nothing Th
that could be uftful only to themselves ; the 1
king and the council having never ceased to tior
think that the fervicts of the English are exc
perfidious ferricet, tending to no other ob- it 1
jeftbut the total ruin of France. par
'/ The municipal agentt shall sub-divide cul|
the diftridts entrusted to their direftion into the
as many military commanderies as they shall a v<
Judge proper. They shall fubrait their la
bours to the king, and propose to him the
j>9rfons who are judged qualified to fill with ton
intelligence and fidelity the fuuations of lons
commanders in chief of the different circles. levÂ«
The commanders are to receive their power tior
from thÂ« king ; but they shall not corref- 1
pond diredtly only with the superior agents Loi
of the party. _
Â« The principal agents, and especially add
at Paris, will spare no pains to ieduce j whi
to the party of the king, all the members pon
of the constituted authorities. They can por;
Â» proinife to every individual all the personal C
advantages which his importance may en- I fury
title >iim to expedt, without the exception the
of any one, even the members of the Cob- ry y
vention, who voted for the death of Lours Hoi
XVI. But they will not incur any engage- S
raent which can give occasion to believe that Orn
the intention of the king is to re-establish coui
the monarchy upon new bases. The king of p
will do every tiling to reform the abiifes 'I
tyhjch had crept into the ancient regime, was
'â ' v .
he but nothing could induce him to change the.
0 constitution. In cafe of a powerful party
W f l"-" Councils proposing to. recognize the
oj king upon conditions, the agents'at Paris :
were; to engage that party to depute Jo his
ivn Majesty a person properly authorized, with
er- whom the king might discuss in person the
rs. true interests of France. 1
Â»k Â« The objeft proposed is the overthrow -
ib- of the existing government. It isin thecon- '
iat ftitution itfelf that the means were to be J
nt found of overturning it without a great '
:k, shock. The frequency of elections prevent '
Â»d the opportunity of introducing a majority 1
n- of royalists into the offices of government
ny and the adminiflrations.
a- " Hitherto the royalists have derived no f
tt- advantage from their number ; theiV pufil- f
cy lanimity prevents them from attending the v
ad primary assemblies, where, if they have giv- t
c- en any votes, it hat been without previous
er j concert, and their votes have been thrown
-J j away so far as concerned the objedta at-which I
:ir | they individually aimed. In order to ob- P
1 | tain a majority of Votes in the primary afTem- n
tie _ blies, it is necessary to arrange three points : b
?d ! I ft, To force the royalists to attend. 2d,
>n To compel them to unite their fuffrages in E
at favour of the individuals pointed out. 3d, w
3t jTo induce that class of men, who have no g
as j preference for any government, love that or- b
I der which protedts their persons and prop
a I erties, to vote in favour of the royalist par- dt
h 1 ty. In order to attain this triple objeft, 4
I ! two associations shall be formed, the one
Â»e formed of tried royalists, the other of timid
T royalists, and men felfifh or indifferent. ft
I "It is unnecessary for me to enter into
if any details in this refpeft, firice you are in
I poffefiion of the regulations to be adopted 'h
>. in thcfe iuftitutions. as
" These two associations shall be eftablilh- ' in

provided for the independence of the legi

of the judicial power. But this indepen- I, s
dence does not exclude responsibility. The
law of the 3d Brumaire has provided for
. the responsibility of the two firft powers,
but not for the Tribunal de Cassation. The
criminal tribunals are also inverted with a 'j 01
dangerous inviolability, and this is the cause |! le
of all the affaflinations which the royalists ,
have been guilty of in France, which havÂ« tl,e
always been committed with impunity, be- rftl
cause the justices of the peace shut their p
eyes, and only punished when they thought
proper. Have we not seen partial magi- t
ftxates fuffer, with impunity, libels which Prel
tended to excite the assassination of the ma- fÂ° ot

MR. TINNO, **
THER.E is a talk of a military parade when the j
'rcfider; arrives. Some on horse and fonie on r
Â®ot âwhile the President rider in a chariot, p"r
aps a coach, and as the Aurera fays, with wheels.
1 will not at this moment enquire by what au
lority the governor undertook to iuilru<st the ad- b
itant general about this buflnefiâHe furcly j
ot consult the democratic society about it, for B.
. B. their eracle, is dreadfully and mortally cha
rined. He ha; puhlilhed a wonderful smart piece S
i his Aurora on the occasion, in which he raves IT
baut slavery, and liveries, and frolics, and nobo
y knows what. He fays the whole uniform of w
ie militia of th> state ought to be ehanged; for if -1
Â»ey wear it they are all slaves, because thePrcfi 1
ent's folks all wear blue coats with red colfari.
he people who serve the President mull be flares th
:caufe they are yankeysâthey are all free men dt
â hen they are in Maflachafetts, where I believe f Q
icy were almost all born and married ; but if tke j
military companies of Philadelphia, in uniform,
lould turn out on this occasion, they are slaves-, and f"
ie Prifident's people all become slaves too. So T
luch for wearing blue and red : There is another B
ling that seems to cause gseat uneajnefsto the Au- (â¢
>ra writer. The militia is compsfed fays he, of
en as free as the Governur ; this you know, and
rery bÂ«dy knows. But you know that we always
ppofed the Governor was general and command- E
in chief over <he militia. "Thi* is the Humbling /];
ock with the Aurora, how one free man can have r ,
right to command another free man. There is â *
ie ofthe faction who fays, he hopes hU hand will
ither, if he Oiould obey the governor's orders.â f l -*
his is a knotty point, I (hall leave it with the ult
iVernor to fettle.
There is another cireumftance, which it seems
as not forcfccn by the governorâU it (bould
in it will be miry, if not it will be dusty, and as
is matter cannot be fettled beforehand, in cither
fe, the Aurora fays the militia will be in a " de
aded, prostituted situation, for the Prefide'nt's
rriagt, it i3ys, will be sometimes before and.
met.nifs behind. The editor, who'l suppose to
the Oht Soldier, is a very wife man, bmt it is
how he should know so much.
I greatly fufpeJt he means to overthrow the 111
bole militia fyfiem, for he intimates that waiting
the President was the object of that fyfte-n,
d what becomes of this bulwark of our bherttrs,
juld that be the cafe ? I wish we knew the in;
II extent of the designs of some people who pa
llow very loud about slavery finae they left off thi
iijg to levee. It appears 3Â« if they meant to
ing in a (landing army. If it is slavery in the
ilitia to obey orders, you may depend we .fliall
in be without one.
The Aurora patnotifm is too partialâl hate lo- â 
I patriotismâNo fslicitude was cxprefTed about j j
militia of Maffachufctts, Cpnne&icut, New- e
irk. or New-Jerfeyâthu' they voluntarily plun-
d themselves into this business poor creatures, Â®* a '
:y did not fee thro' the medium of the Aurora. ei
t there is something more (hocking to appre
nd ; if the militia (bould turn out, it will trant
