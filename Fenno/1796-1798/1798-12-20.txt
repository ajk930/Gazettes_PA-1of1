A publication has lately appeared in mod
npaty. 0 f the papers, from the Academy of Medi
,llf cine, intended to prove that our late fever
was generated in our city. The effect of
jr this publication has been, to puzzle and li
lence many people, but it is to be hoped, not
to convince any one that the fever is a native
â¢iY, difeale of our city.
The citizens look up to your learned and
refpeclable Body, to refute thc charges bro't
against our city, and thereby to defend its
f the crcdit and commerce from ruin. It is ex
e" pefted in your answer to the letter of the
Academy, that you will not reft the contro- '
t# k e verfy upon your own opinion, nor upon the '
opinions of medical writers, but upon facts
?ron- an d solid arguments.

the catching Mr. Bendifli by the hand, occalion-

an awful warning to people not to shave
themselves in anv room wliere there is a cat
present." John Buttonmaker.

It is owing, in a great measure, to rie
gleft of a djc examination of the eondufk
of our public Agents, arid to a want of
thorough mveftigationofthe meafurei which
' they hare adopted, that Jecobinifm yet re
tains a foothoid on the fiirface of the .A me- 1
rican foil. Too well it it known to the few
of the faction who labour to Â£ap the founds
_ tiona of Government, and who would glad
ly supplant the Rulers of the Free, even
through the medium of French aid, that no
ii'coniiderahie portion of the people are ca
pable of being acicd upon :âCavil at thil,
ye vile caitiffs, devoted to disorganization
and hurly burly, proclaim to the class de
signated, that they are treated a 9 a " herd,"
by the" ariftocrati,*' âand that the affump.
tion of delegated power, and the usurpation
of authority veiled in a representative Got
ernment, are the necessary steps to the m
troduftion of halcyon dayÂ», and to the pft
dominance ft fa system which (hall eaiareto
man the blcfingt of a prophesied millensi
urn :âtoo well, I fay it 19 known that a
portion of the people are capable of bting
aded uponâit Â» rot meant'to be suggested
by thiÂ« that nature in every cafe is falil'yâ
but the fatt is, some will not cxercife the
reafou with which they are endowedâbut
will devote their time solely to acquire
ments within a limited fphcre, without
properly adverting to the fmrce which en
ables them to fit each one under his own
vine and fig-tree: Should the barriers for
med by foreign influence, or domestic fac
tion, check the stream which waters the
viae, Â»r cause the leaves of the fig-tree for
a moment to droop, let the trumpet of se
dition be blown, arid Government be poin
ted at as the origin of thi drought and the
blight, and but too ready are the hft men
tioned class to attempt undermining the
pillars of a nation's political cxiftenee. 1 hit
truth is known to the leaders of every vile
fafh'snâthey are convinced ttiat whatever
difadvantage'or misfortune it brought upon
thÂ« country by their unprincipled and d(-
teilcd machination*, tbey can attribute
the measures of government their du
ped and defpicabie tools will echo the
founds of violattd rights, infri"gtd conjli'v
tion, public libtrty in dangtr, and a long M
ofet ceteras peculiarly calcalatcd to answer
: the purposes of the demagogues of the day.
âBut, the may be afftired that
their canting appeals to the paffians of a
certain class of the people will not answer
in this country âthey may delude a fewâa
few may join in the clamourâand a few
may be indamed to far as to point the d*g

The State of New-York in a partial in

laws enaifted by a majority of those to whom
the people had delegated the trull of form
ing such laws :âbut what was the result ?
The proper nii'.hotities pointed out the
mode, and an infnlted majority executed
just vengeance on the di(lurber& of the pub
lic tranquilityâbut a few, it u true graced
a bailor, and but a fevr, comparatively, fuf
fered the confinement of fÂ»lonÂ» âmercy
withheld the merited punilhment âand ex
perience hitherto has juflifieel the benign
dispensationâbut mercy has itÂ» boundsâ
and benignity its limits ; hardened villainy
will not escape, and a repetition of daring
crimes, will number the perpetrators with
those whose exigence ia deemed dangerous
to the well being of society. Let the de
luded of the present day bewareâvillainy,
and diforganixat/on are fporling with their
feelingsâbut when oce the standard of.re
belltoii againll the laws is ereiled, the
feou\drels who have deceived them will, if

as it m 11 afTuredly will, lewe them to the

chosen by the people: the laws they con
ilitirti'"<illy enaÂ£l are binding upon the peo

tors to true republicanifnâare traitors to
our country. At each ele&iou the people
can proclaim their voiceâthe conduct of
those acting conformable to the authority
veiled by that choice, Ihojild he refpefted,
obeyed, fuppirted. Uulefs this is the cafe,
repubfTcanifm is a farce, a"d the only g:i

a tyrant who can point the greatest number
of bayonets towards the breads of the pro

It is a faCl with which the public mind
ougliw properly to be iinprefled, that the ad

in confluence of the condufV of tholb who

our national proceedings, that the American
charafter was reduced to so low aa ebb, as to
invite the insults and depredations of France
towards us, and which induced a helief with
the Directory of the Great Nation, that their
measures could be pursued with impunity.
Had not the wheels of government been
clogged with the clay of Jacobinism had
that manly and firm tone been adopted at an
earlier period, which has at length reduced
the tyrants of the French to lower their
notes, and even to deny (the cleared proofs
to the contrary notwithstanding) that a part
of tlifrir infamous conduft towards us was
unautiioriled, millions of dollars would have
been in circulation among us, which now
Contribute to pamper the pirates and free

* Mr. Fenno, I
s IN your paper of yesterday, after a column
' of virulent abuse againfl United Iriflimen, '
you have introduced my name among those ,
' of sundry persons, who, your readers are "
given to understand, are members of that
aflbciation ; and thus, with equal decency,
truth, and juflice, you make me a participator
u of the abuse you so freely bellow. I am
' willing, Sir, to take your word, that you
were not the compilerof the lift, and that in
the insertion of it, you a&ed merely as Edi
tor, without pretending to vouch for its au
thenticity. But, Sir, let me alk you, how
can you reconcile to your duty as publisher ' j
of a paper, to attack the character, attempt
" to injure the intcreft, and disturb the peace
of a fellow-citizen, without fully and fatisj
faftorily al'ccrtaining the truth of the alle
gations you bring forward ? From the very
keen fenlibility you formerly displayed rei'-
pefting some ftridtures upon your father, I
(hould have expelled more tenderness for the
feelings of others, tlian you have exerciied
on this occasion.
l'o clofc this lengthy exordium, I now ,
declare unequivocally, that whoever inform- c
ed you lam a Member of the Society of U- <
nited Iriflrmer, is a liar, undeserving of con- j ;
iidencc. If Ido not apply any harlher e- j
pithets, it is not because the writer does not j t
t richly deserve themâbut because I think a, j
â¢1 decent "re'c;arcT for the public (hould forbid ; a
0 theufeof such terms as his conduit merits '
. in a hewlpapcr. If the epithet I use, is too
. hard of digestion, he knows where to apply
. for a remedy. I pever in the wj-.ole oourfe ]
. of my life attended a meeting of United 1
Irishmen but once, and that was about eigh
- teen months ago.

f MR. FEKNO, ,
t Being last night informed that you had 1
:, mentioned my name in your paper of Tuef
s dRy as a member of thÂ» l'ociety of United I
â - rifhmen, lam to request that'you will give
- equal publicity to my refutation of a Ciiarge
y wh'ich is at once falfe and malicious.
e I solemnly declare that I never was a
. member of the society of United Irilhmeti,
e either in Ireland of, this conntrv ; ntitlier
e was I ever preient at any of their meetings,
d nor even proposed as a member, to my ktiowl
n edge. I think it necefiary, however to men
:, tion that I do not make this declaration to
i. remove ?jiy supposed odium which may be
1- thought to attach to the members of that fo
il ciety ; for I believe the motives and view? .
cl of that afibciatiofl to be equally laudable and (
1- virtuousâso much so, that I Jhould not be t
deterred from becoming a member, nor from |
1- continuing if I had been one, by all the tor- '
n rents of abuse with which they have lately
e been honored. My principal view is to
ie (hew the public how falfe your information
.- is with refpeft to that society, even in what Â«
â¢- occurs almost under your very nose ; it is ,
(. therefore rcafonable to conclude that your r
t statements of the objedls and proceedings of 1
[, remote branches of that aflbciation mud, at
if least, be equally erroneousâmuch more, it
h appears, they coujd npt be.
II I am, Sir,
Yours, See.
