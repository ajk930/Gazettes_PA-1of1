CONGRESS.
HOUSE OP^REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, May 18.
MR. DENT asked and obtained leave of
absence for hiscolleague Mr. S. Smith,
for two weeks. Mr. Hosmer did the fame
for hiscolleague, Mr. Cochran.
Mr. D. Foster made unfavourable re
ports on the petitions of W. H< Torrans, le
gal representative of John Magnall, and of
Stephen Wockley, which were concurred in.
The Speaker, informed the House that th
hour was arrived at which a call of the house
wds ordered to be made, and that the Clerk
would accordingly proceed to the call.
The call was accordingly made, when it ap
peared that 92 members were present, which
with 13 members absent on leave, and 1 sick,
made up, the whole number Â©t members.
The bill authorising the Prelident ot the
United States to raise a Provisional Army, was
read the third time ; when,
Mr. M'Doweli, moved to postpone the
queftionon the pottage of thitf bill till Tudda#
next. Information had been received from
Â£urope, and was entered on the Colfee house
books of this city, that our Commifiiouershad
been received by the Executive Directory,
and that the persons who had held tinatithori
fed conversations with them on the lubjett of
bribes, &C. were imprisoned. He could not
fay that this information was true ; but if it
were, tmr. differences with the French Repub
lic may probably be amicably accommodated,
and there may be no neceflity to pass this bill
at all. He hoped, therefore, the portponement
would take place.
Mr. Sew all should be sorry if a motion of
this kind were to receive any attention from
the house. It negociations were opened with
the Frerich Republic, they might not very
soon be concluded. What appearance would
it have to the Nations of Europe, if, after ali
the insults and injuries we have received from
the French Republic, the moment Congress
heard in an indirect, uncertain way, that they
had deigned to receive our Ministers, they
stopped their proceedings in all measures ot
defence. A more unfavourable appearance,
in his opinion, could not take place. It ought
to be rccolletted that the army proposed to
be raised was a PrÂ«vifional Army, and wouid
not be raised, if the contingencies therein
named did not take place.
The question for a postponement was put
and negatived, there being only 29 votes for it.
The question on the palling of the bill, was

proporiion, by order of the President of the
United States, among thefeveral States, and
stored at suitable places within each divilion
of the Militia of the State, for the purpose
of being fold out to the Militia at reasonable
prices, and under such regulations as the Pre
sident ihall prescribe. All the seCtions were
{truck out, except the lafL which was agreed
to. Â» lie committee rose, and the bill was re

ANN POLIS, May 24.
Extraft of a letter from a gentleman "high
in thf confidence of the United States, to
his friend in this city, dated London,
February 21, 1798.
" *ou calculate upon a peace for the
rile of he value of land. I am afraid this
calculation will fail y; u. The United States
cannotbe much longer at peace with France.
Our commifii ners are received, and
no likelihoodofit. Thedirc&ory have reach
ed ihe pinnacle of arrogance, and will not
eaf'y descend from it. The French law
of the 'aft month (the particulars of which
vo.i wili be EpprifcJ of without my affifta ce
completely shirs rut all hope of honorable
accommodation. We might buy theforiea
rar.ee of the Great Nation (for so France
row ca Is ii-rfelf)but this does not suit ei
ther our clnraCter or ntereft. We have pad
injuries to hekredrefs for, and future inju
ries to prevent. The latter we might
buy difgractfully but the former will not
admit f even that remedy.l trust the Ame
rican people will feel one common fenti*
mcni of intonation againtl the rapacious
ambition ai d corrupt views of this proud
republic ; and thai they will unite toyman
in vi'.dicating American independence, and *
fuAaining their rank among nations. I have
no doubt it will be so. If war becomes ne
ctflary, we are able to support it ; and re
ther than yield the rights of our sovereign
ty, the interells of our citizens, and honor
of our con - try, to gratify -ny power upon
earth, whether democratical or monarchical
we ought to flake them all up:>n our spirit
and refourceS. All Europe(exccpt Great-
Britaiii)l"eems to be finking beneath the
weight of France. America cannot keep her
fta tionbv humiliating concession : (he mud
d ) it by firmnefs.
" Your cO' jefttires in America about the
jnflability of this government are erroneous.
The accounts you receive are from prejudi
ced sources, principally from opposition
newfpapcrs. Setting aside the frightful
niafs of debts under which it labors, it nev
er was more prosperous, and certainly never
half so firong. Its refotirces arc yet great,
and equal to any probable exigency. The
people a e quiet, and apparently attached
not only to the conllitution, but to the mea- -
fures of adminiftraUon. Its navy gives it
security fromwithout ; and the late brilliant ]
fucccfles of th3t navy have gratified the 11a- 1
tional pride, and raised the spirits of the t
country. The'*hreat of Invasion has only ]
ferred to give new energy to the government '
by producing general union. France will J
find in Great-Britain an unconquerable ene
my.âMr. Pitt has lately trefcied and qua- r
drupled the ajejfed taxes for the purpose of -j
relieving, or rather sparing, the funding \
system, by raising part of the supplies with- 1
in the year; and even this strong measure f
excites np considerable difccntent. In aid
of this, a voluntary contribution is now v
going on, for the defence of the kingdom, '
which will produce a large sum. It would S
produce more, but that the vaporing about F
a defeent is rot thought to be serious. Ire-
land has long been in a dreadful (late, and is j
I believe, only kept down by the military. H
If a French invaiion is at all projefted, Si
Ireland is probably the deltined point v
of attack ; but it fucceeH, even ifl
that view, Great-Britain maintains
the indiiputed empire of the ocean, and has 3
011 foot so powerful a force in every aflaila
ble part of the three kingdoms. It is al- L
most iwpoffible to learn the true situation of V
Ireland (accounts are so contradictory) of "
the causes which have led to it. It is ex
tren ely certain, however, that England and s !
Scotland are in perfeft tranquility, and like- .1
ly so to continue. The minority in par* j'
liament is unusually small, and their influ
ence out of doors less than you would at-
tribute to them. If they had at y such l
influence, the rupture of lord Malmefb'ury's T
regociation, the la.'tmanifeftations cf French A
ambition on the continent, the menace of a J
defeent, and the declared animosity of the
dirtflory, have much decreased it. The 9
partisans of reform are not numerous; If q
peace were re-ellabli(hed, it is likely they j n
would become so ; but moderate men re
collet, that this is not the moment for tr,y- O
in/ experiments on the constitution." T

e 'Tis Union then, ftil! not of arras alone,

in This may you draw from one unfailing Jburce,
"l The love of country ; that endearing tie â¢
; By nature grafted on the heart of man ;

Can give true lustre to the warrior's crest
. And make his battles glorious. Mars m. urge
iÂ° The Soldiers valor, and Minerva guide
His arm to victory ; but flill, unless
0 Defenfe of liberty inspire the war,
e " Each blow that's given tramples nature's lawt,
And gives a death-wound to humanity.
Courage may teach us all to laugh at death,
And wisdom not to fear it, but the lore
id Â° f country gives us nobler thoughts ; O ! could

They felt a pang wlii h none but patriots feel
A pang, regretting they could die but cace.
Nor ir.uft this flame, which nowextending wide
Adorns and brightens all the weltern world,
Be like the spark which the enforced flint
"" Darts to thewounding fteel; âa moment's glow,
to 'T ir.uft blaze eternal as the vestal fire,
, Pretended guardian of the State of Rome :
Tho' that pretended, this is reetlly yours.
le This is the fire that burn
j To save your threaten'd country, this the fire
Whiih once extinguilh'd, never can revive,
5 But from the .ifhes of sepulchred fame :
'â  [t is the vital warmth on which depend! â 
d The life of liberty, which like the blood
h Of human systems, once arrested, leaves
A paflive, useless and corrupting mass.
w O guard it then with ever watchful eye,
h But (hould it weakenâfan it not my friends,
With foreignbreatl); beof yourselves, yourfclves
Tne guardians, independent never sloop
To borrow help from prejudice or spite.
Form no determin'd hate nor hasty love :
The state which wrongs you,is that day yourfoe;
â " Oppose it as your foe, but rulh not thence,
t With thoughtless haftc to the embrace of each
1- May ope its arms.âYour wrongs redrefs'd, at

Your foe'sno moreâ Columb'ans ! seek not war.
_ Yourselves united, can yourselves protedl.
Alliance leads to war, league each with each,

J For, proffer'd aid, the awkward semblance wears

With ready force to meet th' invading foe.
Dcfpifing dingers we increase their force ;

I One fibre wounded, weakens its support.
Dcfpife not danger at a distance view'd :
, Thefnow-ball rolling from themountain's brow,
If unopposed in yet its infant state,
Becomes u mountain ere it reach the vale,
Its size ano strength encreafing as it rolls.
' Fis not that dangers by approach increase,
[ They're still the fame,at diltance view'd, ornear.
The fnow-ballrolling from the mountain's brow

To him refolv'd not to oppose itscourfe.
'Tis opposition firm, at once refolv'd,

Againll the ravcaing tyger bar your gates,
You sleep in peace : âadmit him,you must fight.
Your danger's great; I fear not to alarm,
I not to cowards speak ; your danger's great.
Known it but serves to jnimate the brave ;
Unknown the brave must fall into its snare.
1 his moment it is great ; but, firmly rife,
The next it leflens; as your ranks increase

Beware of those who seek to lull your sense
In dull security's lethargic dream 1

Your foes are watchful, be you watchful too,
Nor, watchful, wait till danger fliall retire, <
Rife all at once and drive it from your land. i
Say some," we'll wait till danger fliall arrive." '

THE ADDRESS,
Of the convention of Congregati nal Miniflers,
in the commonwealth of Meffacbufetts,
e, TÂ© the PRESIDENT of thi. UNITED S TAI ES,
adopted in 80/ ion, May 31ft, '9s,. in full con
vent ion, without a dijfenting viice.
SIR,
WE, the congregational miniflers of your native
state, met in annual convention, feel our (elves railed
upon as men, as American citizen*, and as public
profefTors ahd teachers of chriflianity, toaddrefsyou
at this solemn an J event i'ul crifia.
Whilethe benevolent spirit of our religion and of
â¬ce prompts our fervent wi(heÂ» and prayers for the
universal exxenfion of rational liberty, social order
and chrifiian piety Â» we cannot but deeply lament,
and firmly refill those atbeiftical, licentious and dif
ild organizing principles, which have been avowed and
ed z â¢. propagated by the philosophers a?Â»d po!i.
ticians of prance; which have produced the.grcateft
rn c .'i mc Â® anci miseries in that tfnhappy country, and
like a mortal peflilenca, are diffufing their baneful
1 influence even to dirtant nations. Fiom these prin
ciples, combnied with boundless avarice and ambi
tion, have originated not only fchenies of universal
de Pj u J*der and domination, but infiilious atrempts to
divide the people from their rules,aad in
volve them in a nerdleis, Unjust and ruinous war; ar
bitrary and cruel depredations on their unoffending
w ' commerce; contrmp'uous treatment of their tepeat
ed mefTengers and generous overtures of pt'ace; rapa
cious demands and insulting threats irÂ« answer to the
molt lair and condefccnding proposals.
In this connexion, we offer you, fir, our tribute
e of affeftionatc cfteem and gratitude, and to Almigh
ty GOD, oui devou' praile, for the wife, temperate
and benevolent policy, which has mat Iced your con
duÂ£l towards the offending power, and which has
given a new a id fplendidexample of the beauty and
dignity of the christian spirit, contrasted with the ;
bafcand profligate spirit of infidelity. Wealfo bless
GOD for your firm, patriotic and importaut services
to our country from the dawn of its glorious revolu
tion, and for the conspicuous integrity and wisdom
which have been constantly difpla>ed both by you,
cs fir, and your excellent and beloved predeceflbr.
As miniflers of the Prince of Peace, we feel it to
be our duty both to inculcate and exampiify the pa
cine spirit which adorns his chara&er and do&rine.
e . r^ mc nibei his command to forgive and love our
' mod injurious e. emies. But neither the law of chris
tianity nor of reason requires us to proflrate our na
tional independence, freedom, prosperity and honor
at attnefeet of proud infatiab'e oppressors; especially
of a government, which has renounced the gospel
and its sacred inflitutions, and has transferred to im
aginary or heathen idoli the homage due to the crea
tor and redeemer of the world. Such a probation
would t reafon against that being who gave us our
inestimable privileges civil and religious, as a sacred
deposit to be defended and tran r m itted to posterity.
s It would be criminal unfaithfulne's and .treachery to
our country, our children and the whole human race.
The fate of Venice and other count!ies subdued
by France, though held up to intimidate us to degra
ding fubmiflion, iha 11 teach us a far different lesson.
It fiiall inflruft us to shun that insidious embrace,
which aims not only to reduce us to the condition of
tributaries, 4>ut to flrip us of the gospel, the chris
tian sabbath and every pious institution. These priv-
I, ileges we consider as the chief glory of our country ;
the main pillar* of its civil order, liberty and happi
ness ; as on the other hand we view its excellent po
litical infiitutions as, under GOD, the guardians of
our religious and ecclesiastical privileges. This inti
mate connexion between our civil and christian blefT
ings is alone Sufficient tojuftjfy the decided part which
the ckrgy of America have uniformly taken in lup
porting theconftituted authorities and political inter
cflso.' their country. While we forgive the censure
which our order h2s received from fomt persons on
' this account, we will ftili, by our prayers and exam
ples, by our public and private discourses, continue
the fame tenor of conduft which has incurred this,
malevolent or inifgnided abuse.
Amidfl the fafhionable scepticism and impiety of
the age, it is matter of confolatijn and gratitude that
v we have a president, who, both in worcl and ac
tion, avows his reverence of the christian religion,
his belief in a redeemer and fanftificr of the world,
and his devout trust in the providence of GOD.
May that blins whose important favor you re
j cently 1 ed us to implore, graciously am'wer our unit
ed prayers in behalf of our common country. May
, he preserve your,valuable life and health, your vigor
firmnefs and integrity of mind, and your coufequent
public ufefulnefs ; and at length transfer you, full
of days and honor, to the polfeflion of an eminent
and everlasting reward.

WHEN danger threatens the peace and
independence of the United Statesâwhen
'*> lawless power violates our rational rightsâ
s when we are insulted as a divided people, it
becomes the duty of Americans to rally
around the flandard of thtir government.
We inhabitants "f the city of ShenecSa- 1
dy, in the state of New-York, imprefled
l ic with this idea, beg leave to declaie to the
du President and Congress ofthe United States,
our warm and unequivocal apprrbation of
the measures adopted by our government.
:r to maintain a state of neutrality with the
it, belligerent powers of Europe, to rec nrile
j" existing differences with the Republic of
j France, and to support our national inde
ft pendence. Perrr.it us also to express our
d firm confidence in the wifd im, pat iotifm
and fidelity of him, whom the united voice
I of our country has placed at the head of
,1 her councils.
Â° With every true friend to this country,
we deprecate the calamities of war, and va
l? lue the bleffii-.gs of peace; but if these bleff
t- I ings must be secured by bribes, by the re- j
3 " j linquifliment of our independence, or by (
, any means humiliating or dishonorable to us
!e â¢ as a nation, we wdl cheerfully prefer war, j
i- with all its horror, to a state of peace upon i
fucli degrading conditions.
, s When we view the republic l ! of the old
d world overturned, and their very names !
j.Â® blotted from among the nations of the earth; :

i- come an easy prey to her unbounded atxibi
tion ; we feel as Americans' under such
* circumstances ought to feel, and are resolved

The following address was unanimously re
folyed on : r
To the PRESIDENT or the UNITED STATES.
Sir, (
AT th's important crisis, when war, with a
all its train of calamities, seems ready to a
burst upon us ; when, by the malice of our ti
enemies, we are represented as a divided I
people, a people inimical to the measures of tl
our own government, and wanting cohA- v
dence in it ; we derm it our duty as citizens
of the United States, explicitly to declare, u
our fulled faith in the integrity and wisdom t!
of all the departments of our government, Â«
our high approbation of the conduct of our r(
Executive in its late endeavors towards ne- 0
gocintion with Fiance, and our firm refolu- f t
tion to unite in opposing all foreign influ- f e
ence. We feel and rejoi ein the happiness, tc
freedom and liberty we experience under f e
our present constitution, and we want no ' ul
further incentives, to induce us to devote ' ft
our services and our lives in the support of j pl
it. Nor c<n the attempts made, to mark us ' t \
out as diflatisfied, discontented, or divided, ' h
produce any other sentiments among us, but ' th
those of contempt and indignation. We !) r
have not failed to remark, that the conduft ,
of our government, under the preffnre of 1 re
foreign depredation and insult has been pa- i Dl
tient and pacific, to the utmost extent which ! d t
could consist with the honor and dignity of us
an independent people. And should all â
other measures fail, should our enemies |
drive uÂ» to the last resort, âwe humbly j nc
hope that Almighty God will look down 1 ft.
with favor on the exertions of freemen in
defence of their liberty and their c mntry.

GENTLEMEN,
I THANK you for this address, pre
id fented to me by one of your Reprefentativei
is Congress, Mr. Grove.
The explicit and unanimous declaration
'd of y#ur fulled faith, in the integrity and
:n 1 wisdom of all the departments of ifovern
- ! ment, and your firm ref< lution to unite in
it opposing foreign influence, ar* peculiarly
ly proper and agrt-eable at this time.
The happiness and freedom which you
a - candidly acknowledge to enjoy under the
d : present conditution, are the belt of incen
â e tives to induce you to devote your services,
s Â» an.' your lives, for the fupp rt of it.
J f You who are fatHfied, concerned and
c - united, cannot read the opposite chan&er
>e which has been given you, without con
ic tempt and iftdig atioti at tie calumny.
The govern mi t has ind ed been patient
and pacific, to the utmod * tut, which
lr could confid with th H l-onor and dignity of
n an independent .people u der the preflfure of
:e foreign insults, degradation , and cruelties
'f With you I humbly hope, that Almighty
God will look down witli favor, on he
'> exertions of freemen in Sefence of their

j Antecedent to the Declaration of Inde
i pendence, our prejudices agairid the French
s ' wire as violent, as our attachments to them
; have been since that period. A Frenchman
1- 1 was, then, n objeft of almod as much con
r | tempt and ridicule in Philadelphia,asin Lon
e don. We had imbibed, from the Englilh
e writers and painters, the mod thorough de
- tedation of these people. Differing from
- them in language, manners and dispositions,
1 equally with the English, we were easily led
1 to consider them natural enemVs to the peo
, pie of the Colonies, as well as to those of
r the Mother Country. Even after the alii
ance with France, when it became our inter
s c'ft 'o throw off all these old and ridiculous
> prejudices, it wasjmpoflible to effeft it en
-1 tirely. We were grateful for their good
: services, and endeavoured to forget our an
- tipathies. While they kept at some distance
we regarded them as our friends and del'iver
-1 ers. But when fighting in the fame cause
- the French and American Soldiers were ne
p ceflarily separated ; it would fiave been im
, possible fur them to have inhabited the fame
1 tents in peace. And what is ft 11 more ex
traordinary, long since that period, when
our veneration and attachment feejned to
have been worked to the highest pitch, we
could not bear to afloeiate with them : We
1 admired and loved them at a refpeftful dis
tance. Whenever an American and French
men happen to reside together, in the fame
; Rouse, they mutually detett each otherâ
Do you fee Frenchmen afibciate with any
but themselves ? It is mod astonishing that
we (hould have profeiTed such unbounded re
gard for a nation whose citizens, individu
-1 ally, we cannot bear to keep company with.
The fame contradi&ion is observable
with regard to ourfelvesand the Enjliih
o".e would suppose from die public voice,
. that every individual of our country would
fly from an inhabitant of Grear-Britain, aÂ«
from a wretch infefled with the plague
Exattly the reverse is the cafe. We live
with them in habits of the (trifled intima
cy.- What a tlrange paradox ! what a cu
r ous phenomenon ! We adore a Ftench
man and yet cannot bear him near usâwe
hate an Englilhman and yet are as plcafed
to fee him within our houfesas a brother
I leave it to others to explain the riddleâto
account tor thi- en tanglement of love and
hatred. I reprobate natioral prejudices, e
qually with national attachments. It is my
business to demonstrate that there is no solid
foundation to love the one nation, nor to
hate the othtr.
I have said that I can find but little to ad
mire in mrnarchial, or republican France.
In vain shall we examine the hidory of that
Country to discover any of those liberties
and privileges whith Americans have judly
appreciated so dearly. The grievances we ,
took up arms to redress, were but " as a
Drop in the Bucket" compared to those
that the citizens of France laboured under
when their Sovereign espoused < ur cause.
We complained that taxes were imposed
upon us againd our consent ; and infilled
that taxation and representation ought al
ways to go hand in hand. We particularly
relented the jnjudice and cruelty of that aft
of Parliament which ordained that any per
fonindifted for murder, or other capital of
fence, committed in aiding the Magiflratei
to execute the obnoxious (latutes mig : itbe
sent to Great-Britain for trial. These were
unqueftionably, real grievances ; but vv at
(hould we have thought had the yoke of op
preflion born as hard upon us it did, at that
time, upon the French ? What ftionld we
have said if the King of England, without
the interposition of any other power, could
have imposed what taxes he pleased ?f This
the Kings of Fiance, for several of the lad
reigns, have aftnally done. Would our re
publican pride have fwbmitted to a certain
description of great and wealthy men among
us being exempted from paying taxes, as
was the cafe with the French Nobles who
had obtained with their titles the right of
not contributing to the expences of the
date ? What (hould we have fuid had the
King of England and his Miniders poflKTed
an unlimited power to imprison ? What of
f It was a maxim of the Frtnch Lawyers " Qui
vevt le Roy, si vcut la l oi." The will of tlit
King iitiii 7'iU.of law.*' Lettfer dc Cachet heing notoriouily fold j i
by the miftrefles and favourites" of our So. I a
rereign and " even by their subordinate a- ' a
gents," whereby any of us, without any | V
just cause, might have been suddenly torn I t
from his family and entombed alive ? Could it
we have brookrd the infamy of the feats in r
our Courts of jultice beine; mtorioudy fold j
to the high -ft bidder ? What Would the A- 1
merican spirit have led us to have done had i
any one dared to have stripped us of the c
right of trial by jury, and ordered our cri- 1
rtrinal courts, in deciding on the lives of our 1
I fellow-citizens, to have enveloped their pro- I
I ceeijinjps iÂ» the (hade of privacy? What if (
we could not have txercifed.even the trade i
of B shoemaker or carpenter without pur
chiifing a patent ? All thiswasthe cafe with
the French before the revolution. This
was their identical situation when their king
became " our great and good ally" " the
gijardian genius of liberty" " the prote*lor i
of the opprefled." Had not this ktig and ;
his people fufficien't fc pe at home for the
elercife-of their humanity without crossing
the ocean to avenge our wrongs ? It cannot,
* for a moment be doubted, that the French
groaned under a load of much greater op
prcfiion than the one we had determined to
thfrow off. It would, therefore seem to
foffi', I ftijipofe, that the favour conferred
ivts the more disinterested. How fu h de
ceive tliemfelvKi ! H"ad it suited the prijle '

liberty, no attachment to America would

SOTICES FROM FRANCS.
On Sunday two gentlemen, MelTrs. Hop
kins and Lee, arrived at Marbl-head from
France, and yesterday proceeded on their
route to Philadelphia, having difpatehes
$-<; m the American Envoys They were in
a vessel from Bourdeaux bound to fouth
*ard ; but meeting with a Marblehead fifh
erman, they went on board her, in expefta
j lion of arriving foonsr'at the feat of govern
rnentr Ttjefe gentleman dinned and supped
â with the Envoys on the 18th of March,
â who informed them that there was not the
least hope of effe&ing an accommodation,
that the Direftory would not relax in their
demands, and that they were determined to
leave France immediately. They may there
fore fliortly be espe&ed in America
Mr. Pincknev and Mr. Marlhall had been
treated very cavalierly while in Paris ; the
Ijire&ory that the fending of
them was an insult, b'ecaufe the firft had
been once rejefted, and the other was known
to be Jn'the English interest ; but Mr. Ger
ry (who thry fay was sent merely to make
Uie others acceptable) had been treated with
more civility.
At the time the utmost harmony
tnd fuhfi.'ted between all three, and they
j had,acted perfectly together in everything.
These gentleman further ms rm, that the
new clefliotis in France were going on while
they were on there way from Paris to Bour
deanx ; and, that these might not issue in
a manner contrary to the vitws of the direc
tory, a general imprisonment took place at
onee, of all wo were supposed to be un
friendly to them.
They further fay, that there is no doubt
that the people are heartily sick of the War
of the government â¢, but that the DireÂ£tory
controtil very'thing by the immense milita
ry force which they have accumulated, and
which they mo!t pundtually and liberally
maintain fr.>m an a-nple treasury.
The preparations for he invasion of En
gland, they fay, are b-yond all conception
and wear a m ft ferioun afpeft. The army
destined to this expedition was supposed to
consist of 150,000 men, or more; and it
wns said they'.would proce d in several divi
sions, and to different points, reckoning,
upon the calculation of chances,, that if one
failed, another might succeed. âBuonaparte
fee we have so often heard, was to be the
. commander in chief.
Accounts from Ireland are as much at
â cariance, as truth wi'.h sals:(hood. . Not-
Iwithftanding all the horrid narratives we fee
in tHe Sc Englifhfouthern papers of murders,
incendiaries, and infurre&ton ; an arrival at
this port, direct from Belfalt, which is the
{ revolutionary centre of the kingdom, an
noU"ces an entire tranquility ; and that
ftould the French invade the Iflard, (hey
would catch ten Irijb /jugs, for one fratern
al embrace.

this town who signed the Address to the
Ptelident has been enrolled, and its officers

1 > greater part of the young men are already

j Capt. Goorg* Ropes, in the br;g Patty
honrt i front Salem fur the Spanish Maixte,
' was taken on the 27th of April by a French
privatcerfchconet, who took out a'l his hands
except two boys, and put on board 7 French
man. A letter from Mr. Symunds mate fcf
tin brig Vulture of this town, dated at St.
Thomas's May 7 informs, that on the Jth
a boat airivtdthere with 7 French men, w ha
informed that tfiey wefe ttiÂ« priÂ«6-ma(ler
and men who were put Â©n board the Patty,
and that Capt* Ropes with his 2 hoys and
had re-taken her from them, put them into
this boat, and preceded on his voyageâ
though it is probable as he is dripped of his
men, thar he will put into the firft friendly
port. The letter does nÂ©t give the particu
lars of this re capture effected by such an
inconsiderable ilrength against more than
double their numbers. Indeed one would
have expefted, that the cowardly villains,
however they might be 'oft to a sense of
shame in every thing else fhonld have felt
enough on this pccafion to induce them to
conceal the whole affair.
A report was current yesterday that a
French picatoon having fallen in with a
Newbury fifherman off the gulf of St. La
wrence, and bee use the command to strike
was not immediately complied with, he crew
of the pirate boardrd the fifherman, and
1 murdered the Ski per. The x<fidue of the
crew are said to have arrived at a port at the
eastward. ,

The Houftrcf Reprefenfatives of the Uni- jr
terf States spent Saturday principally in going !
through a very long bill to provide for the
valuation of lands and dwelling houses, and
the enumeration of tiaves within the I7nited
States, previously to the laying a direct tax
on them. The bill was gone through in the dt
committee of the whole, except as to what Cc
related to filling the blanks intended to con
tain the amount to be appropriated for carry- '
ing the law into execution, the {alary of the J
Commiflioners, AflTeflbrs, See. The commit
tee had leave to fit again. No other business p;
of importance was done this day. On the day w
preceding Mr. J. Williams reported a bill
for providing Arms for the Militia of the
nited States, which was committed for Wed
nesday, which was not noticed in our minute
j in Saturday's paper. m
FIRE. ' r
On Saturday evening, about a quarter past fix P
o'clock, the New Factory, in the Prison-Yard of .
this city (a semi-circular brick building, two flories lr
high and three hundred feet in extent) was disco- C
vered to be on fire, by volumes .of smoke issuing f t
from all parts of the building nearly at the fame a]
time.. The smoke was soon succeeded by flame,
and, though the city was immediately alarmed, and r "
the fipe-engfnes and thoufanc's of citizens flew to c
aflift in the quelling of it, the furioui element was
not got under before eight o'clock, by which time y
the whole of the roof, all the windows, three
fourths of the floor, and the greater part of the
machinery, tools, materials, &c. used by the" va
rious artizans employed therein, werÂ« destroyed.
It is not known at present from what cause the
fire proceeded, though, from the evil disposition
shewn by a few refractory prisoners for some-days
past, it is pretty strongly fufpedled to have been S
purposely done. This, however, is mere fuggef
cion. The Board of Infpedlors, we underfland, q
meÂ«t this morning, to inflitute an enquiry into the
business.
The accident is much to be lamented, as this I
convenient and comnjodious building was but just
finifhed and got into complete operation ; and to
repair it, will not only cost a large sum of money, j
but will cause the greater part of the prisoners, in .
the mean time, to be kept unemployed *
Irt the garret of the building vvkich is destroyed, 3
there were large quantities of moss and curled
ha : r. It is supposed that one or more of these (
follows conveyed fire into different parts of this j
'mofc and hair, as the fire broke out in several pla
ces 3t the fame time. When it was firft discovered,
the keepers were conducing the prisoners to their
apartments for the night ; several mad? an attempt
to efcapd. but b) the exertions and CQurnge of the c
keepers they were all soon fecnrcw.
The house in which are thefolitary cells, Tortu- 3
nately did not take fire, though it was in cotifider- *t
able d nger The criminals confined in the cells c
were immediately removed. Much praise.is due a
o several citizens, who voluntarily posted them- j
felvesat the Western gate to prevent the escape of
any of the prisoners V

At the Fire on Saturday, it waswith much# F
pleasure I observed, several young men be-
longing to the new corps of Grenadiers ex- v
rrting themselves with the greatest adiivitv
in themo-l expoftd and laborious-fictions ; c
and that the wearers of the Cockade gcneially 1
were in a particular manner diitinguifhed by
the zeal and energy of their exertions.â

and may your hands never be idle, your f

COASTING TRADE IN.DANGER.
u If nqthi.ig could be done by the En
voys, arrangement would be made forthwith
to ravage the coasts of the United States," i
said M. Y. in his conference with Mr.
Gerry in December lalt : and it seems, fibm
the following, that this menace is in a fair
way to be put into execution.
ExtraS of a letter irom a merchant of New-
JLondon, Connecticut, dated June 4,
1798, to a member of Congress from that
state.
44 On Saturday last Capt. Francis Bulkly
arrived here in ?. schooner from Martinico, j
with molaflVs, who was brought to, about
fix days before, by a (hip direct fiora
France, mounting 20 guns 3 to cru.ze on our'
coast , and four or five more were defttned
on the fame errand. They had taken a vefTl
from Tobago, bound to Portsmouth, with 'j:
a cargo of rum, and fu.nk a v {fel f-om the
southward with a load of corn to
Antigua, as not valuable enough to fend to
France, where they were dire&ed to fend
all prizes. Molasses.not being worth fend
ing tcr France, and expecting to get much
more valuable veflels, lie dismissed Captain
Bulkly." 3
In addition to the above, several priva-
tecrs from Guadaloupe, Puerto Rico and "
St. Domingo, are known to be now upon J.
the coast, one of which has hsd the audacity,
to make a plundering descent upon Edifto
Ifl'and, another to capture veflels off Sandy
Hook, and a third to pursue her piracies
ten miles within the Capes of Delaware. If
they have hitherto fuffered ourcoafting
| trade to pass without an embrace, it mull
j ha*c been because (he part which has fallen
| within their power was not " worth feud- 1
ing to French portsV Our citizens will .
i therefore do well to attend to the danger
!in win ch they are in this refpedt really ex- c
j posed. They will call to mind, that the w
j snrtftramed rapacity of these modern buca- â _
neers is encouraged and prote&ed by a set
| of decrees, calculated for all circUmstanCes
; and fituati- ns in which our property can be
found at sea, and as effe&ual to ensure its b
condemnation, asif general letters of marque
and reprisal were in a&ual operation. - j

The Studies of Nature,
Translated from the French of

By HENRY HUNTER, D. D.
THIS very ingenious, interesting and inflru&ive
work has fines its firft publication, gone
through four successive inipreflions, under the au
thor's immediate infpe<sUon ; besides a variety of
1 printed editions in different parts of the European
' continent.
No book displays a more sublime theolojjy, in
culcates a pursr morality, or breathes a more ar
' dent and expansive philanthrophy 3t.Pierre ena
* bles us to contemplate this universe with other
eyes ; has furnifhed new arguments to combat
atheism ; has eftabliftied, beyond the power of
contradi&ion, the do&rine of a universal provi
l dunce, has excited a warmer interest in favor of
fuffering humanity, and has discovered sources,
unknown before ot moral and intelle<ftual enjoy
ment.
The avidity with clergy and other
learned chara&ers in New-England, have purchas
ed the English edition of this delightful pelform
ance, and the opinion entertained by them ; and
warranted by experience, that although written
before the " Age of Reason," a part of it con
tains a more solid and com pleat refutation of it,
than any thing published since, are perhaps a Effi
cient recommendation of the Studies of Nature ;
in which the Botanist, the natural and chrillian
Philosopher, the friend of erder and government
are equally interclted, and by whieh they will be
equally gratified.
As no pains nor expence have been spared in
procuring suitable paper and able artists, to render
the work worthy Â®f the public ; and as the Sub

publisher flatters himfelf, that gentlemen, who on
account of the bad paper and print of some Ameri

Dear Sir,
I have been fubjed to a very severe Head Ache
for several years, which sometimes used to afflid
me to such a violent degree, as to disable me from
attending my duty as Draftfman, of the Tower,
for several days together. I have had the advice
of several cniinent Physicians in this city and in
Wales, and have tried several other remedies re
commended to me without effedl. Being one day
extremely indisposed with the Head Ache as usual,
I sent for you, when you recommended your Ano
dyne Eflence to me, which I applied, and which
removed the pain, as soon as I applied it.âl fre
quently repeated the use of it, and am happy to
iolorm you, I have had no return of it.
I am, Dear Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
