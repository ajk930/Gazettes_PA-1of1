1 will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po- wb j (
tCa " towmac, for any term. not less thanfeven, nor more than 1
eleven years, from the firft day of September next. The
ir.ill-ftouf ' is 41 by 40 feet, three stories high, built with
Â§ stone, and has in it tluie pairs of French Burr Stones, two
â overshot 18 feet water-wheels, and Evans's machinery
complete, with every other thing proper and necelfary for
m. carrying on the bufmefs with dispatch, and at as little ex- mll
=?, ' penfc as pofiible, all in good order.âFrom the mill to my l
y ' landing 011 the Potomac river, (wherecraft, of any bur- L,cc
then may deliver grain and take in flour) it is about 40 aI T'
yards, and from thence by water to Geoi'ge-Town and b
the City of Washington, about 3, miles, and to Alexan- fto (
, , dria about 11 miles. This situation, aided by a fufficient last.
P ' capital, will command the produce of a very extensive
back country, where large quantities of wheat and other
"rain is annually made, the diilance to it being from 8 F
to 10 mile? let than to any raaiket town upon the navi- â
gation of the Potowmac. There are on the premises a p)
large stone Coopers' 01 Dp, a stone granary, and a commo
dious miller's house. At the landing aiorefaid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, which is in great for
wardnels and probably will be finiihed the e'nfuing fall.
, There aie alio on the premises,. a Brewery and Dittille- |
pass ry, built with, stone, in them are three stills, two coppers A
bur- or boilers,'with every neceitary article, all ngw, and in | e
, w jrood order, and fufficiently large to carry on the Brew- f'' 1
ery and Distillery upon a very extensive plan. This prop- 1 e
erty 1 will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my lands adjoining the premises, and along'the
banks of the river, where craft may lsa4 with ease aiid dil- * a
* patch, is an iaimenfe quantity of building and lounda- "
1400 tion-ftoF.es. Four quarries are now open, and as many *" le
rame more may be opened with ease : the stone taken from these er
ichors quarries is better, and has the preference at this market, "
Tho- to any other stone brought to it. I will reni these quarries IL
separately or together as may best suit. |
next On thc top of the hill, and about 260 yards from the ;
eo 4 mili, is a stone Dwelling-house, large enough for the ac- I^'
t commodation of a family: also, a kitchen, dairy, fmbke- j ?
houle, &e. and a garden, enclosed and in cultivation, the Â®
foi of which is equal in goodness tojmy in this state. I â¢

1 pie concerned in them, have been uninformed and tat
illiterate, and consequently proper machines in the tic
hands of a few crafty uuprinctpfcd demogogues to ,th<
vyoi k mifchief. Credulous, suspicious and ignorant, on :

5 This is the fiKeefsful routine of djforganizers, who Ai
' litft deceive and then- betray thof;, who for want of mc
education are always ready to relit the laws when- ou
ever their numbers inspire 'them with confidence of rat
fucctfs. It is general ignorance that renders go- jut
[ verr.ment precarious, life, liberty and property in- I -

every citizen, even the poorefi. in the common- .en
, wealth, such an education for his children as may

'â  in the advantages of a advan- ann

5 barrier between ignorance and knowledge wherever
3 \ they I âwhile an enlightened community voltin- ed
tarily supports the laws-âthe obedience of the ig- ga

to engage the whole attention of tke childrenâ hi

measure was something more than mere contempt, si
6y it was a maafure of malevolence, and therefore he 1
jo moved, that the leals (hould be immediately put .
upon the regitteri of the central bureau. r
Dumolard moved, that the constitution (hould Â»
not be'departed from, and that information (hoold I
be obtained from the directory, of the measures that f
->â¢ had been taken to repress the attack, and to prose r
cute the anthors. J

a been mouchards ffpies) attached to the deputies,
oft a . tiiey penetrated into the mod private par- t
e ft ties of the deputies. He denounced as Roya'iiits i
and correspondents of the Princes, several principal 1

He concluded in the following manner :
: " 1 support the motion of Dumolard, because I
am convinced that if the threads of the attack, com
- mitled upon the persons of our Colleagues, be tra- P
â¢ ced out, we {hall discover a more dangerous con- P

r (Tallien,, fays the Eclair, feetned, as he deliver- !

- gant husband of thc.handfome Cabarras. He came
to the Council on foot, contrary tq his ufugl cuf- c

the tyrants of France, with Robefpierrt
at their head, were exercifipg their revolutionary
vengeance <>n the people Â«f that country, the â¢
fiiendsof Liberty and Humanity, not only in En.
rope but in America, united in execrating the mon*
fters who perpetrated those cruelties; and at the
fame time disapproved of that Cor.ftitution under
which such sanguinary scenes could be faniftioned.
A\ that time there were not warning those in this
country Who juflified under the pl?a of " imperi.
ous necessity," those infernal tranfa&ions, and rfiout
ed to the flcies what the 'real oMrjiti rif France ?
term the sanguinary code, the ConflTtution of '93.
Since the overthrow of the Jacobin faction, the 4.
proceedings of the Frcnch government have been
over almost without a single compliment on
1 the part of their former eulogists ; nay, so far from
this, the fall of Robespierre has been more than
indire&ly lamented, and the present Conftitutioa
has heen damned by the " firft praise" of our "ex.
clufive patriots."
The lats nefarious cotifpiracy against the Frcnch
' CdnftitutioTV, is reprefentcd as a bulinefe of vcrvin
confiderable importance, and the principal perfcni
concerned in it (though mem rs of the litoCou.

of no influence or abilities. Si
How far this representation agrees with the ac

KINGSTOWN, My 23- f
On Saturday and Sunday last a considerable ntim- he
ber of Caraibs, exceeding 600, came from their
camp in the heights, and took position between our gr ;
ports and the sea, at about half a mile diftanc*.â Â£! r;
The chiefs and heads of families were dispatched to '- r
inform us, that in consequence of their being daily th;
harraffed by parties of the Rangers and other mi
troops, they wilhed to ,place themselves under our foi
' protcdion, until they could comply with the orders ou
of the commander in chief, which they all repeat- fci
cdly promised to do. On Monday, thefon of Cha- lal
toye, in the prcfence of Lieut. Col. Haffey and fe- ed
veral other officers,addrefled himfelf to the attendant di
Caraibs to the following efftÂ£l. " It is 110 disgrace as
to us CaraiHs to fufrender to a great nation. The w
fubje&s of France and all great nations, even of at
England, are obliged to fubrnit to each other, cl
when there no longer remains the means of refill- al
ance. What else is now left for us ? Have we in
powet to continue the war ? No, we have not the w
powers âTo-morrow morning I will set you the 11
example of fnbmifiion, by bringing my family to 1
Col. Haffey, that he may fend us immediately to
the General. You may do as you please, 1 can on- ii
ly be accountable for family and myfelf." a
Young Chatoye'sobfervation6 seemingly had the &
effect he pretended to defiie, and the Cataibs uni- e
verfally promised with the devouteft afTeverations, t!
to accompany him. But being too well acquainted i<
with their perfidy, not to entertain strong doubts f;
of their compliance with these promises, Col. Has C
fey on Tuesday morning, at 3 o'clock, oidered his a
carps under arms, and feit Captaiji Lauder with d
two companies to line the deep ravine to the north- p
ward of them j Capt. M.uriro, with two other com- n
panics, to line the ridge ta the fonth ward ; and the u
Col. himfelf, with a company qf Louvenftein's e
(wnich was attaehed to his corps) polled himfelf to
the yveftward of them ; the sea being to the eafl- 1
ward. Captain Lauder, when he had made the j
nccefTary arrangements, proceeded alone, topievent 1
alarm apd to persuade the Caraibs to resort imme- j
Â«3iately to Col. Haffey, but he found their number 1
very much reduced, for upwards of 300 had fled to t
tlieir retreat in the woode, and among the number ]
-was the orator Chatoye himfelf, and-all of those 1
who had been the moil liberal in their promises of '
fubmiflion. Capt. Munro in closing in with the 1
enemy's campy took 102 of them who were re- 1
treating towards Colonarie, who, with others that
w<#e that day made prisoners, amounted to 280.
These were the people who were on Wednesday
conduced to Calhaqua, and afterwards transported
to Ballifeau. .But instead of being voluntary cap
tives, it appears that they owe their present fitua
tton more to the judicious precautions that were
taken against them than to any regard for their
treaties cr promises of surrender.

On Tuesday no&n also, Lieut. Mackenzie fell Dreai
in with a few othtr Caraibs, one of whom he kill- negro

; I their huts.
< The accounts we have Tircc Tuesday, are very St. !
vague and cpntradidlory. It however, n ]
f that on Wednesday morning the greater part of
' the army marched in different directions in feareh '" ai
* of the enemy. Lieut. Col. Graham's d' v fio n ,
1 wjiich took the route of Colonarie river, after hav
r jng traversed it a great way up, fell in with a party
Y of the enemy on Thursday, who had taken 3 pofi-
Y tiÂ»n at a strong pass or fall, which they had fortih
s ed. They invited him to advance, which the Cal.
in the fulleft confidence of their fineerity and good
difpo'lition did, followed by his party, holding 3 g t t
white handkerchief in his hand ; btR when he hfd
" got within a few yards of the enemy, he was saluted
,J with a heavy and well directed fire, which killed j
d an ofÃcer ofSanteur's corps, wounded the Colonel,
â ' and many others. Our party, after this accident,
.returned.
f > Lieut. Col. HafFeys Rangers fell in with acamp
of the enemy's about 4 miles from the Sea above
Rabaca, which they carried with some loss. Lieut.
J " Mackenzie is said ou this occasion to be mortally jy
wounded. The loss of the enemy could not be as-
ie certained.
