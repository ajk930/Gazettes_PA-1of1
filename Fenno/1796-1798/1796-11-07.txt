Â£From a Paris Journal.^
" Do you .know," said a person to me j'.ift now,
what will form flic mod agreeable part of the fci
it tivalof the 9th Therraidor ? what the aireflory re
g fetves for that day ? In the midit of the fire-works,
J- during the calm of a mild and pleasant evening, a
'* ftiddenly appear, exhibiting thefc
13 worda, written in letter* of gold i Peace, Peace, is
concluded! and a thousand acclamations of
suddenly fill the air."
Thus spoke a good mar*, and all the good people
S round lidened and believed. Their confidence, in
whicK I could not participate, gave me some con
cern. 1 left tTiem, without' feckinjj to djluci the
ie pleasing illusion, and exclaimedâO Cod! wilt
thou pei nlit uÂ» to fee that&me day, on which a ilop
was put to the efftilion of French blood on the fcaf
fold, confecratSd by that grand event, which would
1- pot a Hop to the effufion of human blood in the
field of battle ? That day would then b<j|cme dou
bly sacred to es! It wouid twice deliver tWromthe
> greatett calamities that a nation can experienceâ
tyranny and war.
My mind was filled with this idea, when I met a
man with a Â£rave a haughty mien, and in
flated with diplomatic dignity, who condescended
to utter the following wfrds : " The despots begin to
be humbled ; a few more viÃories, and we Jhall have
them at our feet. Aujlria only waits for the junSiou
of our armies, in the road-to Vienna, in order to fab
mil."
Great God"! to what a pass are we arrived iâ
What new chancct of misfortune, what new dan
ger of definition, have we yet to encounter ? Must
we again be abliged to hear the recital of those
> vidtorieÃ, ever glorious, ever lamentable, when our
armies, repulsed in four attacks, carried tire ene
. my'B entrenchments at the fiftb ? when the fields of
battle exhibited an immense number of vidtprj and
vanquished groveling in the dull?âI turned to the
diplomatic cbarader, and aflted him, if it would
not be equally glorious, equally advantageous to us,
r to offer Peace to the enemy, who must be in a fitu
t ation to wifti for it ? "We are (said ambitions
to obtain the title of a generous nation, aid so eager
are we after it, that we give it tb ourselves. Has
not fortune, then, placed us in one of those fituiti
ons in which we may display our generosity, rnd
f terminate the War, on receiving a just indemniy ?
f "If we consult the practice of civilized Euripe,
we (hall fee, that it Vias always the conquerors vho
offered Peace. Why then, should we meafurtour
â  glory by the humiliation of our enemies ? An not
otir victories our owi! Do they not already bilong
to history J Hitherto Europe ii silent before ij; (he
, regards us as conquerors, who, from the point vh-ich
, we have attained, look forwards, with a meiacing
' eye, to atll the points which we have not yet bten
able to attain. Let ub make known our mod.-ratioa
to ber."
1 At thefeAvordi, the countenance ef the person
j to whom I addressed myfelf, exhibited the fc'rongeft
. marks of disdain, I perceived that, in the kngtrage
of the Corps Diplomatique, the word Moderation lliil
â  retained that abjett and odious lenfe whkh we so
long assigned to it.
" Yes, Msderatiod (said I): âwithout modera
tion there can be no Peace; there cat be nothing
but deftruflive truces, in which your irritated ertf-
I my daily prepares for frefh hoftilitics, feeJcs bow hÂ«
may take you by surprize, and solicits the resent
ment of every other nation.
" That Peace which, 1 trust, will soon be con
cluded, ought to ensure the repose of Europe for a
great length of time. Oh ! how glorious it would
be for our government te establish its claims, to
calculate tbem by the rule of rigid justice, and to
announce them in an. invariable, I bad almost said
in a solemn manner ! Hitherto we have only
known the use ef warlike Manifeltoes; it would be
truly great to publish a Manifcfto of Peace, every
line of which should breathe the spirit of Candoui,
Moderation and Justice ! It is thus that it v.ould be
glorious for us to introduce innovations into the
Pnblifc Law of Europe. <
" Aujlria in aggrandizing herfelf by the parti
tion of Poland, has given us a right, even flronger
, than that which we derive from our victories, to lay
claim to a just compensation.
" One great advantage to be reaped from such a
Manitefto would be that of not making a partial
Peace, but of forcing all our enemies to treat, as

LA CRETELLE, Jun.
For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fenng,
Please to publish the following letters, whichiare
a fatisfa&ory reply to citisen Adct'* note and the '
decree of the French republic. i; i
Philadelphia, July 24, 1793- '
Mr. Jefferfon, secretary of state, to Mr. Genet, 1
miriftcr plenipotentiary of France. 1
Sir.,
Your favor ef the 9th instant, covered the) in. 1
formation of Silvat Ducamp, Pierre Nouvel, Chou- ;
quet de Savarence, Gafton de Nogere, and G. 1
Ben(ticr, that being on their paflage from the '
French Well-Indies to the United Stated, on board 1
veflHsof the United States, with (laves and mcr- '
chandize of their property, thefc vefFels were (top- '
ped by British armed vessels, and their property I
taken out as lawful prize. 1
I believe it cannot be doubled, but by tht general '
low of uations, the goods of a friend found in the '
vefTel of an enemy, are free, arid the goods of an 1
enemy found in the -Bejel of a friend, art lawful prize. J
Upon this principle, 1 prel'ume, the Britifo armed 1
vessels have taken tile property of Trench citizens i
found in our vessels, in the cases above-mentioned, 1
and I confels I Jhould be at a loft on what principle '
to reclaim it. ft is true, that sundry nations, ds
- of avoiding the incouveniencies of having
their vessels Hopped at fca, ransacked, carried into
port, and detained, under pretence of having enc
inies goods on board, have, in many infiancei, 1
introduced, by tbeir special treaties, another prin
ciple between them, that enemy bottoms (hall make
enemy goads, aod friendly bottoms friendly goods j
= a principle milch U's emfcayafiirg to commerce,
and equal Isn't parties in feint of gum orlop ; but
ih\i the effcSlef particular treaty, con
trolling' in fpccial cases, the general piinciplc
v of the law of nations, and therefore taking oiFeft
between such nation only as have fÂ« agreed to con-
C e troul it. England lias generally determined to ad
,s" here to the rigorous principle, having in no in
' fiance, as far as I recwlleAi agreed to the modifi
cation of letting the property of the goods fallow
that of the vessel, except in the fingh one of her
,j][ tieaty with Fiance. We have adopted this mo
dification in our treaties with Fiance, the United
,] e Netherlands and Pruflia, and therefore, as to them,
; n our vessels cover tlie jfoods of their enemies, and
we-lofc our goods when in the vessels of their ene
]'r mies. Accordingly, you will be pleafcd to recol
jj t left, that in the cafe of Holland and Mackie, ci
-0 tizens of the United States, who had laden a cargo
of flour on board a Britijh vessel, which was taken
hy the French frigate Ainbulcade, and brought in-
j lc .o this port tvhen I reclaimed the cargo, it was
only on the ground that they were ignorant of the
declaration of war when it was (hipped. You ob^
served, however, that the 14th article of our treaty
had provided that ignorance should not be pleaded
a beyond two months after the declaration of war,
n which term had elapsed, in this cafe, by some few
days; and finding that to be the truth, thotiph
t0 their real ignorance was equally true, I deslir.edthe
vt reclamation, as it never was in my. view to reclaim the
u cargo, nor in yours to offer to rejlort it, hy qutJUon
ing the rule ejlablijhed in our treaty, that enemy bot
toms make enemy goods. With EnglaÂ»d, Spain,
Portugal and Austria, we have no treaties, there
fore WE HATE NOTHING TO OPPOSE to their afiing
it according to the general law of nations, that tnemy
ft- goods are lawful prize, though found in the bottoms
lr cf a friend. Nor do 1 fee that France can fuffer
r _ on the whole, for though (he loses her goods in cur
vessels, when found therein by England, Spain,"
j Portugal or Au<lria,yet Jhe gains our goods, when
f found in the vessels of England, Spain, Portugal,
j Austria, the United Netherlands or Pruflia ; and
I believe I may fafely affirm, that we have more
goods afloat in the vessels of these fix nations, than
France has afloat in our vessels, and consequently,
T THAT FRANCE IS THE GAINER, AMD WE THILOSER,
by the principle or our treaty ; indeed we
ate losers in every diredtion of that principle ; for
j when it works in eur favor, it is to save #>e goods
P of our friends ; when it works against ui, it is to
lose our own, and we (hall continue to lose, while
J the rule is only partially established. When we
shall have established it with all nations, we fball be
t i" a condition neither to gain nor left, but shall be
less exposed to vexatious fearchts at sea. To this
condition, we are endÂ«avoring to advance ; but as
it depends on the will of other nations, as well as our
own, we can only obtain it, whin they shall be
* r*ady to concur.
# I cannot therefore but flatter myfelf, that or
reviling the cafe* of Ducamp and others, you will
n perceive, that their losses refjlt from the Jlatc of
war, which Las permitted their enemies to take
e their goods, though found in our -vessels, andconfc-
U quently, from circuraftauces over, which ws
H AVE NO CONTROOt. --I â
ExtraS oj a letter from T. Jefferfou, Secretary of
State, to G. Morris, minjler plenipotentiary of Uni
-1 ted States at Paris.
Philadelphia, 16th Aug. 1793.
11 Another fouree of complaint with Mr. Genet,
has been, " that the Eoglifh take French goods out
of American vessels,*' which he fays is againtt the
law nations, and ought to be prevented by us.
# On the contrary, we fuppofc it to have been long an
j ejlablijhed principle of the law oj' nations, that the
goods of a friend are tree in an enemy's vessel, and
0 enemy's goads lawful prize in the vessel of a friend.
j ihe inconvenience of this principle, which fubje&s
merchant vessels to be flopped at sea, feaiched, ran-
sacked, led out of their course, has inducedffevtral
nations latterly to stipulate againji it by treaty, and
to fubjlitute another hi its (lead, that free bottoms
Â£ shall make Tree goods, and enemy bottoms, enemy
c goods, a rule equal to the other in point of loft and
gait 1, but less oppressive to commerce. As far as it
has been introduced, it depends tn the treaties Jiipula
r te"g "Â» and forms exceptions in Jpecial cases to the ge
neral operation of the law oj nationsâ¢ We have
introduced it into ourtreaties with France, Holland
and Prussia j and French goods foHnd by the two
1 latter nations in American bottoms, are not made
-prize of. It is onr wish to establish it with other
nations. But this requires their consent also, is a
work of time, and in the mean while, they have a
j right to art on the general principle, without giving to
us, or to France, cause of complaint. Nor do I
fee that trance cai. lose by it on the whole. For
though she loses her goods when found iu our vef
e fels, by the nations with whom we have no treaties,
e yet she gains our goods when found in the vessels
of the fame, and all other nations; and we believe
the latter inafs to be greater than the former. It
t is to be lamented, indeed, that the general princi
ple has operated In "cruelly in the dteadful calamity
which has lately happened in St. Domingo. The
mifcrable fugitives, who to save their lives had taken
, asylum in our vessels, with such valuable and porta
ble things as could be gathered in t he moment, out
c of the asses of their houses, and wrecks of their
j fortunes, have been plundered of these remains by
. the lieenfed sea rovers of their enemies. TJis has
_ fwellcd, on this occasion, the disadvantages of the
, general principle, -that an enemy's goods are -free
prize 1b the vessel of a friend. But it is en# of those
j deplorable and uuforefeen calamities to which they
t expose themselves who enter intÂ« a state of
! war, furnifKing to us an awful leffÂ»u to avoid it by
justice and moderation, and not a cause of eacoarage
| ment to expoft our towns to the fame burnings and
j butcheries, nor of complaint because we 00
NOT."

in December next, to be observed as a Day of

- Synod of the Reformed Dutch Church, at their last
meeting, agreed to obfeive the fame day.
From the Minerva.
Accounts of a late date from Germany, state,
that the Mitshillian doctrine of peftilemial fluidsiÂ«
J bec&mirig known and gaining an eftahlirtiment in
e their univeriities ; Teveral of their most philofopht
cal and learned phyGcians have approved the prin
ciple, and have pronounced it to be very intercfting, /
e new and ingenious : Some of the iarrft pablicati-
ons in France contain numerous fadts that coincide
, perfectly in support of this fyftern ; and we hear
'' from Great-Britain, that men of lcierice and ta
lents, agree with the American ideas concerning the
1 generation and compofiiion of infc&ious fluids.
The (eafoÃable addrels of governor JÂ«y, to the LeÂ»
giflature of New-York, on this fubjedt, will proba
bly be a prchide to the adoption of such modes of
preferviog and treating diftcmpers, called contagi
, ous, as (hall put a (lop to much of their mortality
in our cities, and prevent the panic and terror,
which almufl every year disturbs the public ttan
quility. If America his discovered the tree idea
J of llw things in theory, then it will be no less
honorable than important to apply found theory to
pradice in the regulations that the legislature should
adopt with regard to quarantine, Lazarettos, intro
duction of diltempers from foreign places, and, at
the governor expresses it, " the generation of them
1 here from nuisances among ourselves." It is to be
j hoped that New-York will set her example and take
the load in this ufeful and public woik.

' We are authorlfed to fay, that Jofiah Riddiek,
\ Esq. of Nanfcmond county, offers himfelf as an
elettor for this dfftrift. Mr. Riddiek is a repub

will if elected vote for Mr. Jcfferfon, and against
Mr. Adams.
Extract of a letter from a gentleman in Philadel
phia, to his friend ia this city.
" Th* President's valedidlory address yeu have
' without doubt attended to. It is therefore the du
ty of the republicans to aft in concert and with vi
gour in the choice of his fucc<;ffor. We mud choose
electors who will vote for Mr. Jefferfon, andagaislt
' John Adams. It is not enough that they vote for
Mr. Jcfferfon, but they muk vote against John A
| dams, lince evidently a vote for Adams in your
' state, will be' a vote against Jeffetfon.âFor vice,
president is very material, so he be a republican.
We here contemplate Mr. Burr, of New-York.or
I Mr. Langdon, of New-Hampshire. Various arts
are already prafliled in order to defeat Mr. Jeffer
' son clandestinely, the President's addiefs does not
fecm to look with a friendly eye towatds him ; tha
serious declaration in the addrels, that an eftaHi/hed
nat'mnul religion is neccifary to fuppott national mo
rality, has an afpeA twwards a r'ligiou; ejltiblifhment,
that ought to make the people who advocate the
rights of conscience look about themselvesâMr.
Adams '.tnown to be a friertd to such an efta- v
blifhment. Mr. Jcfferfon framed yrnr religious
bill, and that is enough to prove him an advocate
for the rights of coÂ»fcitÂ«ce."7,7 thâ¢ Printer of the Gazette of the United States.
Sir,
Miii'tcr Adet faysâ" The flag of the French
republic will treat the flag of neutrals, 'in the fame
ml nÂ»er aathey shall fuffer it to be treated by the
Â£ ; iglilh âHe maintains that France is juftilied
in taking American veflels to prevent the Briti(h
from profiting by taking them.âNow, according
to the rules of this diplomatic logic, England
ought also to take our vtffela to prevent their falling
into the hands of the French, who may profit by
their capture, to the detriment of the British, who
might urge, in citizen Adet's own language,â
â¢' the flag of the Briii/b nation will treat the flag
of neutrals in ihe fame manner as they shall iuffer
it to be treated by the Frineh."
If the fame argument can possibly jaftify the
French m-nite inftnnce, it will, on the fame princi-'
pic, jnfiify 'he Britijh.â But, when the British take
Amciican vcflels, and the capture is illegal, there
is an appeal from their court of admiralty to com
iriiffioncis, delegated by both parties, to arbitrate
and determine upon the terms of indemnification.
âBut, what appeal, what mode of redrsfsâlet
me a fit, have we from the arbitrary and illegal cap
tures of the French, if minister Adet'a memorial
is to be ftri&ly adhered to ?
If these questions cannot be answered in favor of
th' French, what rauft every man in his sober senses
thidk of the modejl^of a diplomatic appeal to the
people of America, through the medium of a netuf
paper? Â»
Fellow-citizens !âis this calculated, do you
ihink, to excite your friendjhip, or your indigna
tion ? Those who begin to blush at it, now endea
vor to apologize it away, by hinting that it is only
an (kctiorteering manauvre ; but sooner would I be
lieve that Dumourier (who is fafd to be in this
country)âor that the your.g duke of Â©rleans (who
lately arrived at Philadelphia) had brought over
minister Adet's letter along with his own pnffport
/ from the French directory, than attribute the publi
cation of it to any such unminifter-like and inter
meddling motive with the governmental affairs of
our country. A LOOKER-ON.

P R O S P E C T-H I L L,

HPHE dwelling house ii built of (lone, two stories high,
* gemeely fimfhed, and contain s four handsome rooms on
a floor, befrdes an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
cellar*. It is generally thought to command the moil a
giceable profpeft of the Delaware, froip the source of that
liver to the Capes. This profpett ia gieatly e.nbcllifhed By
a Full view of a vafl bodv of meadow, through which
ChriilianS and Brandywine crceks are leen winding in beau

e year 1763, or 1764, (and from whom the fubferiber pur
e chafed bills of exchange to amount of several hundred
1 pounds sterling, which have lain by him ever since,) are
. requested, evury man or them that is living, to meet at ,

at 6 o'clock iu the evening, in order to oblige Charles
e Cox, formerly of this city, now of New-Jersey, and John j
fc) Bayard, formerly of said city, and speaker of the House {
ot Assembly of said state, now of Brunfwick, New-Jersey,
assignees of said Scott & M 4 Michael, to come forward aad
pay ever the monies they have had in their hands belong-
tng to the creditors these 3Â» or 33 years. Some years a- (
( go the creditors were called together ; Mr. Cox appear
-1 cd in behaJf of himfeK and Mr. Bayard, and alleged tHat {
s were apprehensive they might be brought into trou-
1 ble if they parted with the money (which I apprehend is
t some thousands,) as his Britannic Majesty had a debt due
1 him for government bills: it was however agreed by the
1 creditors met, thit the assignees fhoul 1 take the opinion of
e counsel; they did so, and it was that they would be fafe
i in dividing the money among the creditors. I urged Mr. J
- Cox to bring the buiinefs to a final close ; his answer was,
1 it would be but a trifling sum; my reply was, if ever so
s trifling, I would have my proportion of it. It has how-
[ ever iain over.
\ 1 therefore hope the creditors will now come forward v
and oblige the assignees to divide whatever they have, and v
they onght to pay intcrtft too.
