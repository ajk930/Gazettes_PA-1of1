f.fihV people believe !il the pro fp eft of o'
a f;Tr"rai peaccj on accoilrit of the exhaust- si
'ed flati of As nations at war. But this i n
vea&n is not decisiveâFrance has been three | n
years exhauiled, but she carries on war by ! oi
'plundering nations that are not exhausted. > la
While any part of -Europe retfiains implutu*. cl
dtfed by her afmieÂ«t /he can carry on war b
and will not be driven by poverty to make . ft
peace* While the wealth of Spain, Portu- aj
gal, arid the Hans Towns, remains untouched, ? v,
we can hardly expett peace. There is no ( rr
difficulty in finding pretexts to plunder those \ Ci
nations and states. The process for ft Â« re- p
publican" army, is the mod simple imagina- : -
ble. It is only to march a body of trpops ji
thro' the country âfay Spain and Portugal : rr
â¢. make some oppressive demands on the ?tl
people, or kif'jlt the priests, who are called rr
fanatics âthus provoking the people to afts p
of violence. These aft* of violence will v
then serve as pretecb to threaten the nation ! v
or Rate with " terrible vengeance," unless si
they purchase pardon with heavy payments v
of money - and the poor dogs mull submit. '
It is all -a joke to fay' France cannot-carry on I
â war ; the truth is, she cannot carry on peace. *'g
She lives and thrives by warâpeace may be J t
her ruin. j Â®
As-ta Airftria, the government is poor ; ii
tut the.emperor has yet immense resources ! c
in the pridÂ£, the wealth, the spirit, and at- j ii
ofhis Hungarian fitbjefts ; and it j c
is against the sharafter of thehoufe of Auf- ; a
trij, ai l the principles of human nature, to j c
suppose that proud imperial family will fuc- . i
eumb .tamely to the facrifices demanded by t
the French. While any chance prefsnts it- ' c
fel'f to the emperor, of a change in the caÂ» -
binets of Europe, which (hall enable him tÂ« 1 \
.retrieve his fortune, we raay consider the , v
signing of preliminaries merely as an expedi- t
ent to gain time and avail himfelf of negoci- : f
ations to ftrengthet\ his own power and 1 a
weaken that of his edemy. g
Great-Brit-iin is mortgaged to pay the hi- r
tore-It of a gigantic d*bt ; and while she is t
daggering under the load, /he is incapable . t
cf exerting her natural strength. But onee I t
difeneumbered from that, Great-Britain has i
resources to cope with half Europe in the ;
maintenance of fleets and armies. t
As to the United States, it is not im- e
probable that an accommodation of differen- -
'ces may take place with Trance : not on ac- t
count of any attachment to our interell or t
form of government, but because it may t
happen that the French councils may be c
convinced* it is their interest not to drive us c
into hostilities. If they wish to retain the , j
jurifdiftion and the trade M*their solonies in f
the Weft-Indies, or with their allies, to keep Â«
the Floridas and Louisiana, they will not 1
permit a rupture between the two countries; (
for all those poffeffiona are within our reach f
and our power. \ <

John Bork, the fugitive Irishman who t
formerly published a paper in Boston and i
has written plays for the amuferpent of the (
inhabitants of the United States, has ad
dressed a letter to Harrifon Efq. 1
abusing him for calling the cargoes of emi- :
grants from Ireland, " hordes of wild Irish- ]
men."- The letter ifc in the usual ranting f
stile of modern liberty J'tys, who talk iriuch
more about government than they under
stand. But we notice the letter principally
with a view to txpofe the arrogance of the
writer, who infin-uates that the writers in fa
vor of owr administration, are " boys that 5
can hardly spell," and that many " school t
boys in Ireland are capable of teaching our Â«
legislators the principles of government." 1
This remindsols of some young men from J
that country, who, with a commoti fehool
education, came to America just after the j
peace of 1783, to set up schools and teach 1
the Americans English. They really sup- t
posed, before they arrived, that Americans j
in general could not speak the English lan- ]
guage. _ '
Burk however, in his letter to Mr. Otis, 1
gives us some cinfolstion. He fays if
there should be a revolution in Ireland it ;
will pnt a stop to all emigrations to this 1
country. If this is true, all we can fay is,
that we hope in mercy there will fpecdily
be a revolution. , _ # '
There are many excellent citizen* from â 
Ireland, who have entered into buGnefs in I
thcfcUnited States ; and the Irish people of 1
breeding are remarkable for generosity, hof- 1
pitality, bravery, and other virtues. But i
whether Mr. Otis was correft in his expref
fiori or not, his ideas of the mass of people â 
brought from Ireland are just. The moll
of them are from the debased and comipted
part of the Irish nation, and 3re a nuisance
to this country. - A fin.
PARIS, June 24.
Sir Sidney Smith tÂ» Central Pichegru,
Prefidentof the Council of Five Hundred.
When I learned from my prison that Pi
gru is ele&ed President of one of the Coun
cils, and Barbe Marbois of the other I re
joiceâbecause this homage paid to virtue,
to, to probity, ind to talents, affords mea
hope that moderatibnand humanity will reign
in France, and establish 'harmony between
our two nations, formed to eftecm each
ether. . .
I recolleft that the non-execution of the
decree of death palled aguinll the English
prisoners of war, was partly due to your
firmnefs and humanity. You have prevent
ed this blot ofbarbarifmjrom being fixed on
your nation.
lam a prisoner of warâl did not surren
der my arms till after an obstinate refiftapce,
and till honour commanded me to do so :
persons l>ave pretended to * uvil about the
weakness of my detachment, wllich dared
to measure its strength during three quarters j
"â¢f-an itoÂ«JT with thofj that furroucded us. j
I have V.een unprifoned as a cnir.inal, and I
have fuffered all the rigours of h solitary con- 1
finement during thirteen months. I have 1
made repeated applications to the minister of 1
marine* >having been taken at sea ; to which
however, he haa never deigned to give me ;
|riy anfWer. I sent a defeription of my ii
tuation to the Executive Dirtftory, with- ]
out any effeft.âAt the expiration of the! i
firft seven months of my detention, the mi- 1
j nifter of justice sent a of the peace to
j me, who interrogated me on a vague charge
! of having done something contrary to the
1 law of natioirs. The justice of the peace
. clearly Convinced that the government had
been deceived by exaggerated reports, and
. struck with the absurdity of thus proceeding
agaitift an officer for the common events of
war, formally promised to procure, if not
my liberty, at least some amelioration of my
! donfinement. Since that, fix have
pasted, and I have heard nothing from him
! -* The accusation brought forward by the
justice of the peace was, that I was the ene
my of the rep-Ã¼blicâYÂ«u know, General,
; that with military men, the word enemy has
merely a technical fignification, without ex
prefiing the least charafter of hatredâYou
will readily admit tl)e principle,' ( the result of
I which'is, that I ought not to be persecuted
for the injury I have been enabled to do,
whilst I carried arms against you.
I trust the council will not be offended, if
' I do not address myfelf to them in the lan- ;
''guage of a suppliant. Acctlftomed, owing
; to my Eiiglifh education, to refpeft power ;
â  only for the good it does, and not for the â¢
injury it may wish to do me, I thing it ne
! ceffary to state my exaft fituationâBcfides j
! it would te an inlult to the council to foli
j cit its justice and humanity as a favour, by ;
t appearing to entertain a doubt of its eariieft j
' desire to manifeft both! No; notwittyland- .
' ing every thing I have fuffered, I have not j
: the least doubt of French generosity I
' only complain that it has not a free course
â¢ ' âThe doors of my prison are shut to those,
1 i who, having been my prisoners in England,
; would, I make no'doubt, afford me, (now
â  that I have, in my turn, need of them) the
â¢ â  fame consolations that I offered them. I
I ' am fearful that this example of rigour will
get into usage between the tvro nations, by
â¢ reprisals being made. I have done every
1 thing in my power to preveut it, in order
: j that the base passions may not take place of
: i those of a nobler nature, by which the mil
-1 itary of every country ought to be animated.
â¢; You will find, by the annexed papers, that
the exchange of prisoners, has been delayed
. eight months by the refufal to set at liberty
. âThus, when I speak to you of my own
â¢ misfortunes, I bring to your recolleftion
â¢ those of ten thousand Frenchmen. Itisra
â  ther your influence that I ask, than any aft
of you as a body, unless, indeed, you will
i decide the (Jueftions, whether the minister of
: , justice his the right to make a ftrangtr fuf
-1 set under laws ot which he is ignorant, and
) 4at the fame time to violate
t by prolonging a facret, which deprives him
; of all counsel, and of every means of de
-1 fence. I refpeft too much the demarcation
of powers, not to acknowledge, that as a
prisoner of war, I am entirely at the difpo
-1 fition of the executive government; but it
1 is doubtless occupied too much with affairs
: of importance, to attend an individual.
1 beg you citizen Prtfidcnt, to be con
. vinced of my veneration for the august char
- after of a representative of the French peo
- pie, and to accept this testimony of my e
j fteem for you personally.

y Paris Journals of the nthand 12th inft.
were received in town yesterday afternoon,
a which were brought to Dover in a flag of
1 truce, having on boaid the M. Spinola, Am
f baffador from the republic of Genoa to our
"- court. The most material article contained
t in thtfe papers, is an edift lately iflued by
the king of Prussia, on the fubjeft of the re
e cent proceedings of his Imperial Majesty,
1 from the general tenor of which, the great
d eft apprehensions are entertained on the con
e tinent, that the flame of war will soon be
kindled between those two monarchs.
The only mention made of Lord Malmef
bury's cmbaffy is, that his Lordfhia had his
firft interview of business with the French
I. commissioners on the Bth inft.
i- The situation of those departments whith
1- arc infefted with conspirators con
tinues to occupy the attention of the legif
:, lature. The capital remains iri a state of
a the utmost tranquility,
n We have received the Paris papers to the
n 24th and 25th ult. These papers contain
h some very spirited obfervjtions of Dumolard
1 in the conncil of five hundred on rtie revolu
le tionary manifeftoes of General Buonaparte,
h in refpeft to Venice and Genoa ; and the
ir conduft of the Direftory haa been denounc
t- ed, for having assumed the right of making
n war and peace ; and for concluding alliances
without she concurrence of the legillative
1- body, or even any communication made to
f, it. An important faft is mentioned ia the
: Redafteur of the 24*11 ult. "that the em
te peror had deferred the conclusion of a defi
d nitive treaty of peace, until the Congrefi,
raj stipulated in the firft articles of the kite prc
s. | liruioaries ofpeuce, is held." '
1 . .. * ' 1 *
It is coriftfled, in the Pans fapeft, that a
(Iror.g 1 antUrevolutionary spirit begins to
lhanifeft itfetf against principles in Lomoilr
dy. Pavia and Como are said to be the cen
ters of this fermentation. Buonaparte has
proposed. to .the general adminiilration of
Lombardy a federation of all the national
guards. This, he fays, will be the point of
re-union to the people of Italy, and being
determined to perish.or be free, their ene
mies will turn pale with affright. .
Strong hopes of peace are entertained by
the people of France. M. Colahen, fecre
tafy general to the commission appointed to
treat with the Englilh Ambaflador, set out
i for Lisle on the 23d of this month, to make
; the neeeflary arrangements for opening the 1
negociation. The propafed Congress will 1
not take p!#ce unti! after the signing of the |
preliminaries between Great Britain and !
France ; at lead fuub is the assertion of i 1
tbofe writers who art considered to ftind j
highest in the confidence of the Executive j
Direftory. .
A letter from the Hague of the 4th _
fays, that the Texel fleet has not yet failed,
as fome.of our journals have aflerted, bur
it is certain it will not be long firft. All
the troops are to be embarked by the 7th
of this month, and faid to amount
! to 15,000, all of whom aic Dutchmen,
j There is at this moment a fleet of Englifli
(hips, composed of ten fail of the line, be
fore the Textl ; it is thought that the
Dutch fleet will consist of 22 fail of the
1 line, and in all 100 jreflels will give battle
to the Englilh. These Dutch (hips are
supplied with great plenty of ammunition,
j 30,000 muskets have been embarked on
: board thÂ»m, and the crews arc in good or
| der, so that the grcateft success is expefted
j from this expedition, which, according to
, the most probable opinion, is dire<9ed against
j Scotland or Ireland. Some persons, how
ever, pretend that it is destined to (htot Hp
the Elbe and the Wezer. The whole of j
the 3d battalion of tin 2d demi-brigade I
of grenadiers has been broken) for having I
opposed the embarkation.
On Sunday last lord Malme(bury deliver
ed to M. Letourneur the projet of our
court, as thf bafi* of the negotiation. In
this note Great Briton consents to reftbi*
all the conquests matte from France, but
excepts ihofe of the allies. A very long,
and naturally, a very interesting conference
fenfued on the general interests of both
countries, in the course of Which M. Le
tourneur remarked on the great balance of
trade which would remain in the hands of
the English, were (he to keep pafleffion of
all the conquests made from her other ene
mies. M. Letourneur, at the close of the
conference, said he was not authorized to
give any answer to these propositions, but
would forward them to the executive direc
tory. On which lord Malme(bury remark
ed, that he wi(hed to be understood that
they were points which might be modified
by further difcuflion.
BERLIN, July 1.
It appears that a considerable misunder

that of Vienna. < A proclamation has been

According to information which xvehiave

having heard us, caused certain orders to be

party entirely in favor of the complain

ing us and ; our rights, and to detach our
fubjefts from the obligations which they
have conttafted with us, and they have even
formally summoned persons of the Equeflr'an
order to consider tisno longer their sovereign.
The orders by printing and circulating
which it has been attempted to mislead our
fubje&s, areâ
-1 ft. A mandate of the Aulic Council of
the 17th March, 1797, on the fubjeft of the
reaffertion of the claims to the (overeignty
of Brandenburgh over the Bi(hoprick of

As according to the laws of the empire,
we cannot look upon the above orders as
valid or obligatory in law, but on the con

KINGS SPEECH.
House of Lords, July 10-
At a quarter before four o'clock, his majesty
being seated on the Throne, with his crown and
robes of state, gave the royal alien: to the bills
upon takle.
The house of commons bemiÂ» ordered to at

at their head, who addressed: his majeftv in a
(hmrt fpcerh. He recapitulated briefly the lead
ing measures adopted by the house in the course
of the feflionâthe provisions made for the in
ternal security, as well as against external crimes
The public necefiities, he laid, had induced
them to grant fupp'ies to an extraordinary a
mount, but they had been careful to make their
provi(ianÂ» io such a manner as to render them as
liftle btirthenfome as possible to the people. He
concluded with observing, that however painful
the dti'y of voting such large fum-. they had the
coniojftion to think that they would be expend
ed wli the ftri&eft (economy.
His majefly then delivered thÂ» following roost
gracious speech to both houses of Parliament:
My lords and gentlemen, *
I cannot put an end to this session of Parlia
ment without returning yon my most sincere
and t-ordiil thanks for the assiduity and zeal
with which you have-applied yourselves to the
important objecfts which have required your at

you have manifeOed. in the new and dtffisult e
mergencies for which yeu have had to provide.
I null particularly express the just fmfe I en
ertain of the fali;taiy and Â«SjÂ«Sual provi lions
which you made for (lengthening tne means of
national defence, and the mttfurrs adopted for
obviating the inconVenienciet which were to be
apprehended to ensue froA the' temporary fuf
penlion of payments in cash by the bankâas
well as r>f the promptitude, vigour, a "d effedt,
with whieK you jTocded me your a(Tnlan r e and
fuppo't 'n fupprcfling the daping and treafona
ble mutiny which "broke out in a part of my
fleet, and in counterailing so dangerous Â»nd per
nicious an example.
I have the fatisfa&ion to arqtiaint you, that
since the acceflion of. the present Emperor of
Kuflia, the commtreial engagements between
the two countric. have been reÃewed in uch a
manner as will. I doubt not, materially conduce
to their mutual interests.
Gentlemen of the house of commons,
I must return you my particular thanks for
the liberal and extensive provision which you
have made for the various exigencies of the pub
lic service j and, while I lament the necessity
which encreafed them to so large an it
is a consolation to me to oblerve the artertion
you employed in diilributisg the heavy burdcfr.s
which they occaConed, in such a manner as to
render their prcfliire as little severe aÂ» puflible
to my people.
N My lords and gentlemen,
The iflue of the important negociation in
which I am eng:ged is yet ui\Â£ ertain. Bui Wli t
rve'r may be the event, nothing will have bit
wanting, on my part tÂ« bring it to a fuccefsful

Then the lord chancellor, by his majefly's
command, said
My lord and gentlemen,
It is his majesty's rova! writ and pleafnre, that
this Parliament be prorogued to Thursday the
sth day of Odlober next.
Should pea-e, an event so ardently wilhed
for by all descriptions of nieu, be attained, the
public mind ought to be prepared fÂ«r the
tion of the Alius taken at Toulon by lohl Hood.
Our miniiters have certainly come to that deter
mination ; and we corroborate our,affertion by
the following fadV: That one of the commif-
G iners of the Transport Bo*rd, after a refidonce
of some days at Portsmouth, whither he had
been sent to make a survey, presented within
these very few days, to the Tdulonefe, who ar
rived in the Toulon (hips, an estimate of the va

a final adjustment of all differences between the
two countries.

Saturday evening, after attending their par
liamentary duty, the lord chancellor, duke of
Portland, and some other peers, and also the
fpcaker of the house of commons, Mr. Pitt,
Mr. Dundas and some other members, set off
for Beaconsfield, to attend the funeral of the
late Â£. Burke, esq. which took place that
evening.
Monday Mr. Dressings, the messenger, ar
rived at Dover in en open/boat from Calais,
and reached town at a very late hour on Mon
day night, with dfpatches, from lord MalmeJ
bury. These dispatches are said to be of the
grcatrjl importance. In all probability they
contain the proposals mede by the directory as
the bafts of a pacification. The particulars
of the intelligence cannot be known, "hut report
Jlates it generally to be of a favourable nature.
sl letter from a gentleman at Lisle, dated
July 14. received in a very refpeftable quarter
in town flales, '' 1 arrived here but yejlerday
morning, and I have not yet the means of en
tering tntimately into the train of the negocia
tion, I rejoice however to inform you that per
sons the mofl particularly connected with the
' commission, speak in sanguine and CQnfulent
terms of the issue of the conferences." . Indeed,
the general idea is, that tlx negociation is likely
, to have a favorable termination. The pacific
sentiments and the long diplomatic experience of
the new French dirsUor, Barthelcmy, cannot
fail to have considerable weight with his col
leagues. The puUie epin 'ton in France is
Jlfongly in favor of peace, and the fame wi/hes
for that defiralle evsntprevail in this country.

From a speech of general Buonaparte, puh

We have again to notice the pon-arrival
of any intelligence from France. Ministers
were for the whole of yesterday in hourly
expectation of receiving a dispatch from lord
Malmclbury ; but 110 messenger had reached
town when this paper went to press.
The Ruffian cabinet has ordered its mini
sters at foreign courts -to make fix declara
tions refpeiting the unhappy Poland, and
one of which contains the following article t
" If from motives of hatred, on account
of this treaty of partition and its results, one
of the three high con trailing'parties (hould
be attacked by any foreign power, the two
others promise to join and defend him with,
all their might and power against such at

The form of organization for the Vene~

Bouquet, the French comniiffioner, who

Yesterday morning dispatches were re
ceived at the ndpiiralty from commodore fir
John Borlafe Warren, containing the pleas
ing intelligence of the under his
command having intercepted a French con
voy, and captured seven {hips, laden with
provifiobs, on theft paflage from Nantz to
Brest, for the purpose of supplying the fleet
at that pprt with their cargoes. The gal
lant and indefatigable commodore, we are
happy to add, has also driven a French fri
gatÂ« on the Penmark rocks, and deftroy'ed
a corvette of 12 guns, and a large vessel
laden with timber, which he could not
bring off. It is but common justice to his
merits to fay, that there is no officer in the
British navy to whose aftivity the country
owes more than to fir John Borlafe Warren.
A report was yesterday received in town,
via Portsmouth, that admiral lord St. Vin
cent'i had an engagement with the Spanilh
fleet, and captured five fail ofÂ»the line;
but we are sorry to observe, that the vague
manner in which the rumour cameanto cir
culsticn, Entitles it to very little credit.
The statement, however, is not without
some degree of probability. If we are
rightly informed with refpeft to the nature
of the last dispatches from his lord ship, the
enemy were hourly expected to put to sea
in order to give him battle ; in which cafe,
notwithftandifig the disparity of numbers,
when we consider the superior gallantry and
discipline of our fleet, wc entertain no
doubt of the event having proved honoura
ble to the British flag.

The hopes we entertained that the pre
sent ftrtiggle between the majority, of the
Legiilative Body and the Direftory would
not affeft the public tranquillity, are rather
disappointed by the last Paris papers, which
seem to announce a more serious result of
that conflift than we were inclined to expect.
We have not been negligent of any oppor
tunity that might offer to inform ourselves
of what# is pafling at Lisle ; but the follow
ing letter which we yeflerday received from
a gentleman'there, shews the difficulty'of as
certaining any thing very correft respecting â 
the negociation.
" Sir, " Lisle, July 25.
" I received your letter, wherein you
desire me to fend you a Bulletin refpefting j
â¢ the state of the negociaticms, carried on by
Lord Maltnefbury and the French plenipo- 1
tentiaries.
" I fliould feel extremely happy to satis- !
fy you on this point, but nothing transpires
of what is passing that can be depended on ;
and I fliould not wish to mislead you. To
prove "to you with how much secrecy the
negociation is conducted, I mnft inform you
that even the French plenipotentiaries do ;
not fee each other but at the time and placs
of their, fittings, that when they meet they j
communicate their ideas and observations in j
writing to one another, and receive the an- 1
Avers in the fame manner ; which, at the |
close of the fitting are sealed up, and the j
plenipotentiaries withdraw.
" This is all we know of the negociation,
and consequently it is utterly impoflible that
any public print should give-the least infor
mation on this head which can be relied on.
Lord Malmefbury and Le Tourneur never
fee each other but on matters of business,
when a note is always previously sent, re
queftingj an interview."

Yesterday the Hon. Mr. Wefley, brother :
of lord Mornington, and secretary of em- I
taffy, arrived at the secretary of date's of- c
sice, with difpatehes from Lord Malmefbury. 1
He left Lisle on Saturday afternoon, and
came to Â£)over on board the Diana packet. e
/ We have rcjfon to believe that he brings the 1
answer of the executive direftory to Hhe last a
proportion of our court, but that nothing 1
that can be. relied on has transpired : an j'
letters by the packet, and even the printed
journals, were stopped at Dover. There
cannot be a doubt that Mr. Wefley's errand
here concerns some very delicate points res-
pefting the progress of tjie negotiation, v
which perhaps, could not be well commur.i- l
cated by ordinary dispatches ; but, whether
of such a nature as are likely to facilitate or 1
.retard the conclusion of peace, it would be .
vain to cftiijcftur?.

The following art? the details of the bom- w
bardment of Cadir: ,
011 the 3d July, signals announced that
the English fleet which blocks up the port, g.
and is still at anchor in the road, had receiv
ed three bombards: admiral Maffarcda sent N
fix gun boats under the fort of St. Sebafti-
an, to prevent the English from approsich
ing, and gave Gen. Gravenat, his second e>
commander, she conduct of this action, tin
officer of n-.evi,!, and much e(teemed. At a
quarter from eleven an English bombard, â¢ v
fupperted by a fliip of the line, a frigate,
and some (loops, furilifiied with mufqueteers,
approached St. Sebastian, and threw fever- Jfc
at bombs iiUa the to\vn,one of which fell up- fcu
on a house in tne street Marguie; the pt;r
lons who lived in it being at fuppcr, left it jiÂ°
j for fear. - Another bomb fell upon a house .
of La Lanulla, where there is a public
walk; a child was killed, the mother going
to its afliftance, fell into the fiole made by the
bomb, and was hurt, and another child
which (he was nursing died of the fall. Gen.' '
Gravenat charged wfrh the 'defence of she
town, in these cireumftances, (hewed great
presence of mind, and was well feebnded;
he made some gun-boats, which were pro
tected by fort St. Sebaltian, advance, they
came in time to do To much datpage tq a w
bombard, as to oblige the English tq let her T
go to the bottom, not being able to get her
off. JThe frigate was wounded in the mnft, S(
the (hip received two balls, and the mqrtars
of this place beingVell employed, they did SI
not faftcr them to approach nearer. Tliey
then sheered off, and ceased fireing at half Si
pad twelve p'clock, but the Englifii gun-
'oS- boats furround c ,-l, and took two SpaniZh
ow " gun-boats whicÃ were; ffparated from the
Â°f a the actions the Captains
tits <>' which (brave officers) were killed. The
it.it Engli(h fleet on the 4th received a.reinforce
any tnent of five or fix gun-bosts, but measures
,ord are ta^en fÂ° r repelling them. At three
1 hi? o'clock of the morning the women and c-hil
:ace dren left the town, t and went from two to
â¢ lie. four leagues into the. countrys it cost a
' person 120 livres for j place in a calash;
" u boats were dear '1 n proportion. On the
hat light of the sth the bombardment commen
"sin ced with more obstinacy than before; bom
bards were placed betweeafort Saint Sebaf
'â w ' ian al Peere. The gun-boats Vere
fcÂ° a " repelled. The EngliOi threw near, two

CAUTION.
W HER PAS a combination of med in this

ftlves,by faUricutiiig titles tofunc'r/ valuable traAs
of laud, the property of gentlemen living in New
Yoik, Philadelphia, London .ma Paris, for whioh
tra&Â» of lend large funis of money have betin paid I
tp those fraudulent,men, by innocent purchaser* â¢
It xs therefore just tnst public information fliould
be given, to the end, thai the injured may ferk re- ;
dref* while the racn have property, and are to be
found. Those who have bean discovered areTru
m n Harrifou, Joseph Witcomb, said now tore
fide in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and |
several other! who go under fi&itious names. It is
supposed that the lands offered fcr sale On those fa
bricated titles, are at lcworth fifty thousand j
dollars. Such as we have a&ual knowledge of are [
as follows ; Lots No. II and 12, patent,
thoufanJ acre* each, the aClual property of William 1
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thnttfknd acres each, the property of !
Mr. Chaumcnt, now of Pari?, and lemeaAverill
and othew, of tint State. There is lome grounds
to suppose that the lands of Richard and
Charles Wharton, ps Philadelphia, are under their
management.âThe Primers will do well to give ,
this a place-in tJicir papers, as wÂ«U to caution the
public against purchÂ»Rng thcue lands, as also tt> de
prive those men in future from imposing on indivi
du*fÂ», whicn tneir education and address have en
abled.them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been |
a shopkeeper of some note in this couiKry.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
of view tha wickcdnefs ol thole men,which when
the public have perufid, will induce them to ea
cufe the intnference of Wm. COOPER.
