MARSHAL WUIIMSER,
Who lately died at Vienna, in the 73d
year jf his age, was born at in
1724, and entered at the agt of Kitten, mta j
the French feivice, as cadet of artillery, I
Vvhicl corjjs he soon abandoned for that of
the civalry; and, in #740, was appointed
" cornet in the regiment of light horse raised
by the celebrated Marshal Saxe. He focm
at traded notice as a bgld rider, and for his
â peculiar manner in the conduil ox the light
cavalry. In the fsrne year he was advanced
to lhe rank of major in the regiment, in
conffquence of his brave conduct a' the tak
ing of Prague, and of the jodicious maiiner
in which hccoveied the retieat oft,he French
from Bohemia, under Marshal de Bi'llifles.
He was afterwaras c, ppof-d to the celebrated
Pandour coipmapdcr, Trtnck, who laid
1 wafle BaÂ» iliaWurmfer, however, loon
flopped h s progrets. In 1745, he ex
changed the French service fur the Aus
trian, and was made colonel of the fame
regiment of hufTai* which he commanded
afterwards as general. During the war of
1746 and 17J9, betwixt Auflfia and F:e
derick of Prussia,' lie had always commands
in the line of battle, alleys diitingnifhing
himfelf for his bravery and judicious ma
nauvres. He never had an opportunity to
signalize himfelf as a general, till the new
Pi ufiian war in i 779, when he was entrufled
with a fcparate command. The maftferly
manner in whicll he planned the attack of
the Prussian rear, in the retreat from Bo
hemia in that year, aftd the attempts Hvhich
he to intercept the whole train tf ar
tillery, procured him the highest applause
among military men, and even Frederick
himfelf acknowledged it to be a firft-ratc
piece of generalship. It was the" Prince
Royal of Prussia. now Frederick William
11, who defeated these fc'nemes of Wurm
fer. The Prince had his own regiment, the
sd regiment of footguards, Tunas's b.ittal
lion of grenadiers, and Appenburg's dra
goons, to cover a file of artillery and wag
gons, of more thaÂ» twelve Englifb mile' in
length. H. : Â« cavalry was in the last divi
sion, mo-e than five miles backward, when
Wurmfer, by a forced march, (whereby ht
escaped the vigilance of the King himfelf,
who commanded the covering Column) ap
peared a: three o'clock in the afternoon with
'BOOO Hungarian cavalry, tn front and flank
of the Prufiians, and in pofleffion of the
heights and hollow grounds of Burkerfdorf.
where the train was to pass. The Prince
perceiving that every thing was loft if he
waited for Wurmfer's attack and his ewn
cavalry being too far behind to be brought
into the aftion, took the bold rcfolution to
charge the Auftrians. Accordingly, he
put himfelf at the head nf the foot guards,
and fapported by Tunas's grenadiers, and a '
heavy cannonade, attacked the Aultrian ca- !
valrjr with the biyonet, threw them into con
fufion, and gave time to the king to come up, 1
who soon arriving, took 9QO prisoners, al- '
though Wurmfer renewed the attack. He
had three horses shot under him in that affair. 1
Frederick, after the adiion, declared, " It '
was the firft campaign of my nephew ; I 1
always thought him a courageous man, but '
row ht has shewn himfelf a judicious gene
ral, and has acquired more glory from the
chara&er tif the great general who opposed
him." In 1788, Wurmfer commanded a
separate corps in the Bannat, where he dis
played his talents in opposing and flopping,
by fkilful marches aiid counter-marches, u
nited wi'h bold attacks of light cavalry,
the progress of the whole force of the Turk
lfh empire, headed by the grand V\z\r. In
1789, he covered the whole Â«f the Austrian
army in the unfortunate retreat f. om the
Bannat, and with his own and Barco's regi
ment, prevented more than 20,000 Turks
from seizing the military chefl and baggage. '
111 1790, he left that army when Laudo'nn I
took the command, with whÂ»m he was not '
an terms of friendihip. In 1793, he was
appointed to the command of the army in- 1
tended to ait against the French in Alsace. '
On the 13th October, he made a grand at- '
tack upon the lines of JLaurer, and farced
them, after little reliflance from the enemy,
who loft almost the whole of the artillery.
Wieffemburg fell soon after, and
the French, firft to Haguenau. and then to
Wanzenau. near Stralburgh. On the 27th,
he w s, in this place, attacked by the
French ; but he compelled them to retreat
with the loss of 3000 men. Ihe famous
Hort Louis, in Vaubaa, fell into his hand 9,
on the 14th November. Here his successes
terminated, and his genius was coippelled
to yield to the.enthnfiafm of the republicans,
under the command of Pichegru and Ho
che. On the Bth of December, hii army
was dfivtn from Haguenau, with immense
l<">fs ; on the 26th, from and
finally across the Rhine. The latt service in
which Marshal Wurmfer was employed, was
to attempt the relief of Mantua when besieg
ed by Buonaparte. This event it so recent
that it is uonccefl :ry to repeat the details in
t lis place. lhetacJics of Wurmfer prov-
of little avail against that phenomenon of
mihta y genius, Buo- aparte ; and, after se
veral days of hard fighting, he was compel
led to throw lumfelf and the wreck of his
army into Mantua. The brave defence
which he made in that city, renders its
siege one of the most important in modern
historyâthe victor Buonaparte paid a tri
bute to his military charader, such as few
men have received or defeved from an
enemy.

In faÂ£t, the firmnefs and vigour of the
United States, in nil probability has prt vent
ed war with France.â Ihe French calcu
lated their party in America. Thus
was the fciiurge of war which they threat
ened. Without this they are impotent. By
entering into a war with America, they can
do no more mifchief than they have already
done by their cruisers. The impudent de
mand of a tributary loan they will abandon,
because they cannot enforce it. They will
accept or perhaps efftr reasonable terms, be
cause by ti'cir precipitation ibey have exci

The gooi ar.derftanding which prevail*
between Lird St. Vincent and the Spanish
governmen; has given umbrage to the French
Executive; and the republ'can army under
General Angereau, at Perpignan, has re
cently received confidrrable augmentation.
His i.'atholic Majesty was forcpd into the
contest witii th s country, in opposition to
his inclination and interrtts ; and in its pro.
fecutioQ has experienced nothing but disa
ster and disgrace. There exilts therefore,
a strong concurrence of circumstances to
warrant the opiuion, that the cabinet of
Madrid is wearied sfthe war. The influ
ence, however, which enforced its unnatu
ral coalition with Fiance still prevails ; and,
we apprehend, must render ah overtures, or
difpolition for peace abortive. The recip
rocal civilities of ths . British Admiral and
the governor of Cadiz are most extraordi
nary, ai d we believe unknown in the annals
of war.
Arnaud, the celebrated Naturalist, who
was taken on board of the Sensible with

received every where with the utmost ur
banity. â¢Â« H t was alked," he fays, Â«â  if

on board cue fame (hip wiih that general,
and very frequently in his state cabin, but
that he never gained any information or
this subject. The general, he added, Was

1_ Cong:
Of Buonaparte..
Conjiaatirioplc, August to.
There no# esi!ls not the least doubt of AJfem
5 the French Toulon fleet having landed in
Egypt. Our government has received in
formation of it throagh several different
channels; but it has not;yet received any
tirciimftantial details of the military opera
, tions of Buonaparte, and the opposition
[, made by the inhabitants. The letters and
j reports which continually arrive, are too Con S
|4 Vague and contradiftory to be relied upon.
Some announce the taking of Alexandria Sena.
c and Roletto with the loss of much .blood,
and that the Candian merchants who were â "M en
j there in great numbers, were all put to the
,f sword. Others affurf, that the French are
j. 1 already in poffeflton of Cairo (situated at
j_ | 153 miles from Alexandria,) wbilft our bell
t ! Buonaparte has been obliged to retreat, af
ter a bditlc fought with the army of' the AU"
Beys, betweefl Cairo a?d Rofetto. â¢ The
difagreenoent of all these reports iv a frefh
ie reason for pricing confidence in the official
m 1 advicss, received by the Po te from Dami
.n j etta, dated July tB, woic'n lay. that the
.| T French were entrerched in the enviro.is of
i Rofetto (39 miles from Alexandria) r.i view
1, of tlie army of the Beys, which was only AW''
lt g one an half from their camp,
he g reat fermcnta on Hill reigns in this
r , 3 capital, and the police will be forced to r -
( ; (l [. double its vigilance in order to hinder the
th people from committing,violence upon the J!''
1 French who are h.re.- However, the KÂ°"{
vernment still continues to aft with modera<
; tion and caution towards them. Every one
' interprets this conduft according to his ojvn
re wilhes or opinion. Some fee it in a secret on
w ' intelligence with the French,others believe
to it to be only an o{ circumfpc&ion,
ir j wh : ch agrees with the secrecy of the mili
j tary operations tiiat are preparing. If any
thing can folvc this fpectes of problem, it
is the orders issued by the Porte to all the -"Â®*
provinces ef the Empire. The preamble is
conceived in termi of thelfmoft marked in- .
dignntion ; the proceeding of the French is JÂ°"
ate there represented as the most unjust aft of "Jr
aggression, and. to the faith
lL '' of treaties. , These orders prescribe mea
sures offenfive and hostile.
n . a ' The English Minister appear* to have
lie much influenced these determinations, and '
his aftive leal neglefts nothing that can tend
le . to strengthen the energy of government..â Or
0 The Ruffian Ambaffadordoes not appear to
,ow shew less aftivity in his negociations ; but
we do not remark a concert in the opera- tiei
on tions of the two Ministers, and if they tend P r(
f . to the fame ttid, the meaos they pursue are tul
aI * widely different.
ort ' Buonaparte has addressed a letter to the t " <
two Divan, in wlijch he fays, that if the Otto
man Porte fliould permit the Ruffian fleet to
pass the Dardanelles, he fliall consider it as t! ?
a declaration of war.
He requires the Grand Signior to put
â g' ll aside all the pretenfious of Russia ;to op
e in pose firmly all attempts which that Court
ufti- might make; and adds, that he has the na
el of jrreateft reason to txpeft such a line of con
was dust from him, as he has delivered him
this from his greatest enemies, the Knights of
: in- Malta.

â d must be numbered the fertility of the surrounding

(v Geneva, and the counties of Ontario and Steuben ; Â£
which renders it a mofl eligible fland for a Stcne or <
ie TavernâThe river and lakes abound in fifh and 1
jf fowl, and the country witb deer and other game. Â«
Besides the mills already eretfled at this place, it a
