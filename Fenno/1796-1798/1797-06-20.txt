peculiar hope, that the people will compel his
.abandonment, to please our enemies, internal

June 9.
This Day at 12 o'clock, his Excellency,
Governor Oilman, in the Representa
tives room delivered to both branches of .
the JLegiflature, the following
ADDR ESS:
Fellow citizens of tie Senate, and
of the House of Representatives,
HAVING in obedience to the call of my
fellow-citizens again accepted the office of
Chief Magistrate, it affords me great latie
faction that I may congratulate you on our
general prosperity and happiness, as k -ref
pefts the internal affairs of the State.
The opportunities we have for promoting
and enjoying civil andreligiousliberty, (hould
excite our gratitude to the Supreme Rtller
of the Universe, and produce a fixed deter
mination, rightly to improve these invalu
able blessings.
As a member of the United States, it is
both our duty and interest, to preserve and
strengthen the ties which bind us together
âand while we participate in the great ad- i
vantages consequent upon the operation of
our federal government, it becomes us to
remember that we must also fuffcr, if.that is
injured.
When we recolleft the past eminent ser
vices of the person who has been recently ap
pointed Prelident of the United States, we
may justly confide that the wisdom, firmnefs
and patriotism, which have heretofore been
so conspicuous in his conduft, on many im
portant occasions, will be.exerted to the ut
most to promote the honor, iitfereft,peaceand
happiness of our common country.
An extraordinary occasion has induced
the President to convene Congrefsâln his
Speech to the Senate and House of Repre
sentatives, the injurious conduct of a foreign
nation, towards our own, is particularly de
lineated :âWhile these circumstances are
( viewed with deep regret, they* must be high
ly alarming.
It being the peculiar duty of the general
1 government to direst in all things relating
1 to our foreign concerns, and to pursue such
1 measures as may be thought proper for pro
( moting and preserving the htmor and inter
est of the nation ; it is incumbent on us to
view the situation in which we stand, and to
ur.ite in a fixed determination to afford the
most prompt a'nd effeftive aid to all thdr
. constitutional measures.
s Peace, on termsconfiftent with our rights
. as an independent nation must.be the sincere
> wifhof all good citizens, and we may believe
s will be earnestly fought for by the Federal
government. But however ardent the de-
fire for peace may be, it cannot be imagined
that a people who not long fipce expended
j so much blood and treasure in obtaining
Independence from onenation, will ever con
i sent to laerifice that invaluable poffeflion to
â¢ another.
Although Congrefsare empowered topro
' vide for the common defence and general
welfare, and for organizing, arming and
1 disciplining the militia ; yet, should you be
it of opinion from a view of the general afpeft
s of our public affairs, that it is necessary at
â¢ this time for the state to make further provi
' fion for arming andfdifciplining the militia ;
or to take any other measures for the parti-
I cular defence and fafety of the State ; what
e ever you may determine upon will meet my
- zealous attention.
Gentlemen of the House of
Rep refentat'rues,
1 Coniidering the magnitude ofthe debt in
' cuiTed during our struggle for independence
the state of our treasury has hitherto been as
. good as could be expe&ed ; âyet from a
â  view of the prosperous state of our country,
' and the ability of our citizens, I have here
tofore thought it expedient that taxation
(hould be Continued ; that we might b? more
amply prepared to meet fncli difficulties as
are incident to all lbuman affairs. At a pe
, riod not very distant, the prices of many ar
ticles of the general produce of our country,
may probably be much reduced. Should to
Congress find it indifpciifubTy netcilary t\> th
lay a dirett tax ; and the particular cireum- vc
(tances of the State require an assessment for tli
our owu internal affairs at the fame titoe ; ei
this double tax may beburthenfom.âThefe H
eonJvdcrations induce me to ask your .itten- ie
tion to the fubjeft at this time. . fa
Gentlemen of nhe Seriate, and
Genth mrn ',f the Jlaufe of Rfyrefentatives, cl
In a fcparate communication I ftiall lay n<
before you fojrie obltrvationsrefpectingfoni- oi
penfationsto persons employed in administer- la
ing the government of this state. fc
Although we may view with much anxi
ety the general aspect of our national con- si
a rns ; it becomes our peculiar duty to con- tc
fider the affairs of the state. In recurring bi
to the Constitution, we (hall there find many L
important matters, which claim our nttenti- tl
on, and by upright endeavours to cftabliih d
jqllice and .promote the general welfare oi C(
the community, we (hall best answer the rea
fdnahle expectations of our constituents, and si
secure the approbation of our own minds. b

.(Mr. Se, wall's Speech concluded from the j
Gaxettc of the I2tb infl.) ! \
If there is a neccffity of yielding to !
Fence and giving up principles which are ! |
just and honorable for us to maintain, let it j
be done in the mode pointed out by the Con
stitution, by the means of difcuffioit be- ;i
the Minister of the Executive and the ' v
Diretlorv- of France. He thought it a
matter of great importance to the United {
States, that we (hould prefer,ve those articles ( -
in our treaty with France which give free
dom to our commerce in time of war, and .
which limit the articles of contraband. To v
suspend our advantages during the present j
war in compliance with France, if fhere- > a
quires it, would be better than a total relin- f Â£
quilhment. The close of this war may j a
give an opportunity of difcnfling.this sub- | j
jest more fuccefsfully than it could be done j j
at this time. Perhaps the United States â  [
may. obtain even from Great Britain to con- 1
fider and agree to make goods free on board j
!of free (hips in all cases but those of aftual (
' blockade and investment, we may obtain j
, from her to limit the articles of contraband : (
If it can be done, it is needless tp fay, that t
our commerce will be greatly benefitted,
and in the periods of European vyar will ve
ry much increase. In any-view, he asked, j j
why surrender this part of the treaty with j
France, without a reciprocal stipulation as ; t
to some articles which are disadvantageous j
to the United States ? Why is this to be | t
done out of the ordinary course, and by the j (
direftion of the House of Representatives,
without the concurrence of the other de- .
of the Government ? He here (
anticipated ari argument which he had in- j
tended to offer in another place, and pro- ; 1
' ceeded to (hew that the House could have no i (
' reaffln to hesitate in giving their confidence ,
to the Executive ; for there had been no ]
remiffnefs of endeavours for entering into a
negociation with France ; on the contrary,
iit would appear from the highest authority, â 
that attempts had been made to negociate, .
and that the negociation, had been directed i .
to the very objeÂ£l of our present concern , !
and had there been on the part of France a ,
disposition to accomodate, they might lo.ng
hare had fatisfaSion, upon all the com
plaints which any of the Committee have; j
thought deserving of confederation. He !
then read, from Mr. Pickering's letter to Mr. |
Adet, dated 30th June, 1795, several pas- '
sages to prove the eagerness which the Ex- '
ecutive then difcovertd to Mr.. Adet for,a
negociation with France, and having con- ;
trailed the conduct of the Executive of the 'j
United States, in overlooking Mr. Adet's !
want of formal powers, with the. conduft of .
the French Dileftory, who were supposed
by their advocates to have driven Mr. Pinck
ney from France because he had not the
charafters of a special Envoy, he proceed
ed to read some passages from a letter of
Mr. Adet, dating objections to the British 1
treaty, and the reply of the Secretary in
July 1796, and upon these he argued the
â  earnestness of the Executive of the United t
â  States to give France fatisfaction on the i
1 fubjett of these complains, which Mr. Adet ;
' had offered as objections to the Briiifh trea- !
: ty ; in fail he was ready to allow that the
advantages supposed to be secured to our
commerce by the treaty with France, but
: which in faÂ£l we had never enjoyed, as
â¢ France had instantly and openly violated the
: treaty in this refpeit, could not be retained, '
unless all nations would submit to the fame
- rule, or unless neutral nations (hould arm j
I themselves in support of the rights of their
I neutrality ; but with the United States,
; the commercial advantages to be obtained
â  would never compensate for the hazard and
1 expense of arming. To concede these ar- I
tides of the French treaty, during the pe
riod of the present war was a matter of no j
I importance, but to retaiu them as a fubjeft |
I for difcuflion when peace (hould ensue, and
with a view to their being generally Adopt- 1
ed appeared to him to be very important.â j.
To make the conceflion as proposed by the
amendment, was at once to lose our hopes of .
, an equitable arrangement, which might
prove so advantageous to the commeree of ,
- nentral nations. Suppose, said he, that thei
amendment before the Committee is agreed
to, and an Envoy extraordinary is sent to
Paris, carrying with him not as concealed
inftruclion*, but openly, this direction of
â  the House of Representatives to the Execu- ;
: tive of the United States, what will the '
i Executive Directory fay ? Your Reprefen
-1 tatives have conceded to France this article J
, of your treaty, and are desirous we (hould 1
have a right to infliS upon you all the lofies i
1 which you fu(fer at the hands of our ene
: my. If this .Envoy talked of entering into
i ilipulations, they would tell him he had 110-
â¢ thing to argue. You have your inflruftions
â  from tbe Representatives of the people,â. '
, look to them,; it would be Â»n vain for him
â¢ t
' 1
â to urge his inftmSijns froni t' - ss<k.rÂ»t ''
they would aofaer'him,.wÂ£ know your ga, fc

1 have to N come tD thifc con- p
ekifiort; for, after aft, the violations of our vy
neutrality, the depredations and fpohations o
on our commerce,, by both France and EugÂ» ci
land, have little to do with the question be- w
fore us. , * n
The qoeftioh b, whether we will agree to t<
firch an .address, as will (hew our ilifpofitrcm v\
to defend our country in cafe peace cannot a
be maintained with France. Whether the p
United States (hall have peace or war with p
the French republic, was, in his opinion, to j
depend upon events over which we have uo i .
controuL I
Tlte French are not pointing their mea- ; o
fares against the United States in particular, . t
but they mean to.compel all other r.entral i ii
nations to abandon the British commerce : â¢ n
to this end they have coerced the republic i Â£
of Genoa : their influence has been more di- â¢ b
reft still upon Geneva, whose government o
they have overturned without any open war. f;
' They have annihilated the independence of C
j the Dutch ; and they lead as in firings tne
j humbled monarch of Spain. It is not the
| United States alone, that is threatened;
Denmark, Hamburgh, Bremen have heard 1
the mandates of the French Directory, and i
are required to withhold from any commerce i
with England. It depends then upon the 1
power which France may have to execnte i
these intentions, whether the United States 1
(hall be alike coerced. .
Looking upon this country as involved in
the general designs of France we fhmild pro
vide for our defence, before "(he (hall sudden- r
ly overwhelm us, annihilate our government, t
| and reduce us again to ?he abjett (late of Â£
i colonies. If this cannot be dons we must
i abide "the misery which we cannot avoid, c
j Let us have it to fay that we were not neg- t
i ligent in providing against the evil, that our i
j nation did not meet its fate without aftrug- 1
, gle, and that we did not at once join with <
France in producing the misfortunes of our i
country. Let us have it to fay that we i
; have fortified our harbours, that we animated
our militia, and armed our (hipping,'but as- ]
ter all that we were forced to submit to e- i
I vents we could not controul. <
He believed that we had resources in our- '
selves, and that we (hould obtain the aid of i
j foreign nationsâit is 4>t to be supposed that -I
| they will look on inattentive, or that they (
j will be indisposed to join in alliance â with any
; nation likely to be involved in their common
! calamity. .Ii .France has alfea'dy divided 1
many nations, and by that -means overcome,
them, if she is still rushing on in her mad
career, the time may come when all nations
feeing no end to her ambitious projects, will
; rife together to oppose her: their united ;
] exertions may succeed against the over
whelming power of France, and secure to
the nations their independency.
There is a hope that our danger may be
prevented by various circumstances. France
is yet in a revolutionary state : there are
frequent changes in the French government,
; a change of mtn may produce a change of
measures, and the apprehension of driving us
into a- close foreign alliance may have con- :
. fiderable effect in preventing her from pro
! fecuting any hostile intention (he may cnter
! tain against us.
j He did not mean to ihfinuate that any j
gentleman in the committee was in the feral-
left degree under the influence of France.
| He -would attribute observations and argu-'
* .meats unaccountable to him, to thatfenti
' mer.t of gratitude to France of which so
* much has "been said.
He thought if we could relieve ourselves
in the present crisis by our own exertions,*
we (hall he more secure hereafter ; we (hall
have less confidencein the kindnefsof France,
and we (hall become more secure, as we are
. convinced that our happiness depends alone
upon ourselves ; upon the love of our coun
' try, and the support of the constitution, and
' a disposition to defend it against all encroach-"
ments from foreign influence or domeltic sac
. tion.
| If the address, to the Preftdertt is viewed
i in this interesting light, we cannot hesitate
. to rejeft the amendment ; We cannot hesi
tate to leave it to the proper ccrnftituted au
thority to make the compromise, which w'e
all deiire with the French republic.
He had been surprised to hear it faid-that
the President's speech was a declaration of
warânothing can be more contrary to the
truth. In what part is the found of war?
Is a recommendation to arm in our own de
fence a declaration of war ? Is it a declara
tion of war to fay we will defend our go
vernment and ourselves ? It might be under
stood that Americans are attached to their
! own institutions, and will defend them to the
, lalt- ' ,
j The mear* of this defence recommended
j by the Pretitient are not now under consider
) ation. There is no choice of measures in
I the report of the feleft committee ; there is
; nothing intimated that implies such an idea.
. He understood the reported address merely
j to express that we wilj undertake the defence
. of the country. If the fubjett had been
' thus considered, we had been spared from
* hearing accusations of the Executive, .and a
debate to fettle.the articles of a treaty. We

MOKIDA.Y, JONF. 19.
A communication from the "Department
of" War, inclofmg a repoft, in pursuance of
the resolution of the Houfe'of the 16th
inft. of the number of artillerists engi- >
neers in the aCtual service of the United
States, was read. It states the whole num
ber of men to exceed 870, but to fall short
of 992, the full compliment. They ara
said to be stationed as follows :
Ofwego, Niagara, Detroit, MtcbeliO
mackinac, Prefqu'ifle, on the Mifli- > 438
fippi, & ia South Western Territory J
At Weft Point 105
At New York 60
At Philadelphia and Mud Illand 90
At Baltimore _ 59
At Norfolk 56
At a Fort in North Carolina 6
At Charleston 62
.Total, 876
This report was committed to the Com
mittee of the whole; to whom was commit
ted the bill providing for an additional re
giment of artillerists.
Mr. Parker moved that the Committee
of the whole be discharged from the fur
ther consideration of the bill respeCting the
manning of the frigates, and the bill from
the Senate for the protection of the trade
' of the United States'! in'order that they
might be referred to a SeleCt Committee to
incorporate the different subjeCts together.
Several objections were urged to this pro
p.ofitipn, and the sense of the House being
fir ft taken upon difeharging the Committee
of the .whole from the bill from the Senate,
which was, negatived, only 27 ,votes being,
in favqr of it, Mr. P. declined takiug the
â sense of the House on difeharging* the oth
ers.
Mr. A. Foster presented a petition from
New Haropfhire, complaining of thfi opera
tion of the duty which was last session laid
upon (tills, under a certain dimension, aiK
praying relief. Ordered to lie on the table;
. The bill dire&ing the appointment of
Agents for assisting in carrying into effect
the 6th article of the British Treaty, was
re?d the third time and passed.
Mr. W. Smith from the Committee of
Wkys and Means, reported a bill to providt
more efftftually for the collection of cer
tain internal revenues, which was twice reacfe,
but, on the motion being made for commit
ting it to a Committee of the Whole on
Monday next,
Mr. Gallatin moved.that this bill tie m:.d
the order of the day for the firft Mondial
in November. He' said it had been twf
years before the-Committee of Ways ar.(
Mea'ns ; and thought the regulations rnigh
j be good, yet they were mere petty detail,
( (and he thought if. there were time fort
they ought to be better) withgt
which they had done hitherto, aiÂ»d if th<r
"took this bill up*, he knew none which coul
be proposed, which they might not a!fo t"-
ter upon with as much propriety. He will
ed to confine their attention to business im
mediately connefted with the upQ
which they were called together.
Mr. W. Smith wiflied the gentleman hd
deferred his motion till the bill had beÂ«
printed. The"--gentleman himfelt had ac
knowledged there were many valuable prf
vifions in it, and the Secretary of the Tre*
fury had' informed him that mapy â¢" then
were necessary to secure a due collection a
the revenue. Gentlemen must be convji
ced that an increase of revenue will be ui
ceffary ; and if additional revenue could fc
raised, by a modification of this kind, t
would certainly be'preferable to laying nav
duties. The gentleman from.Pennfyivam
who was never. vary read-* to lay a new ta;,
surely could not object to this.
Mr. Giles supposed the decision upon tie
question would determine whether thflr
Ihould go home soon, or fit there the wlidi
summer. As it was- no uay connected win
the call of the pre sent session, he truftedlt
would be poitponed.
Mr. Kittera did not know but it might lc
proper to poitpone the business, but he bi
ped the bill would be printed.
Mr. Brookes was against thepoftpois
ment ; he thought if it would be the meins
of railing revenue, it was clofcly connected
with the business of the prefect fdSwi.
The question for a poftponemci I was put
and negatived, there being 41 votes for it,
and 48 against it.
The bill was then committed for Ws4-
nefday next.
Mr. Giles v. ithed vo go into a Committee
of the Whole On the bill for riifi 11;,-an ad
ditional regiment of artillery ; for thourh
the repbrt received this morning f:om th : -
Secretary of War was not printed, being
short, he thought that could not lorm an
possible what the House meant to do.
Mr. W. Smith opposed the motion. He
trulted this subject would be inferred till
to-morrow, that the report received this
morning have time to be printed.
Mr. Giles withdrew his motion, and cal
led up the report of the Committee of Ways
and Means, propoiing to lay ?.n additional
-duty of 13 cents per bushel on fait impor
ted.
The House accordingly xca: into a Com-
Imittee of t'ie WhulÂ« on that fubjtft anJ fe
t!ie refolutio.i havlag t}Â«;i roa 1, to
Mr. Gallatin moved that the Commktse to
might riftt>- ,
Mr. Lros said ht fbould be forry-if the pi
committee.were to rife without any obje&ioo la;
being raade to a proportion so u:irtalcmable hÂ«

would hear particularly hard upon the coun- to
try from whence became; and that for ev- ec
srv auarter dollar of duty which was d'
they fhotild haye three quarters of a dollar ft;
to pay when the fait reached them. He trust- ta
ed it v.-ould not be cirfied. fu
Mr. Williams wifned the Gentlemen th
had moved to make the propbfed advance H
less than 13 cents. As there was nr> jn-oba- 8<
bility, that a land-tax would be laid, he fh
should give his consent to this; if a land-tax.
ln<i bee.) agreed to, he should oppose a fait ft;
tax. He thought, however, 13 cents a to
bushel too much. It was calculated to raise, ti
300,000 dollars. Every one allowed it was in
a fafe tax. As far as fait was consumed by
families, it was. a poH-ta?; but as to what g'
\ras consumed by cattle, it* was a tax upon -
la,rriculture. What colt a half a dollar at fa
New-York, cost where he lived, 2 1-2 dol- m
!arÂ«. A common farmer, vVith about 100 - ra
cres of land, did not use less than rb or 12
bufhtls of fait, He therefore paid five dol- 81
lars tax npon a fiÂ»gle article. Yet they I
were fometiivies told farmers paid no taxes, ui
He wiflied a part of this tax to be laid upon y
fame other article. He moved, therefore, rt
to strike ouf the 13 cents and insert 7- tl
This motion not meeting with a second, P
the question was taken upon the resolution,
and negatived, 481042. ti
The committee then rose and the house fl
took up the resolution and confirmed the ne- n
gative 46 to 44. 0
On motion of Mr. Blount the house g
went into a committee of the whole on the v\
bill Airenting a detachment from the militia v
of the United States. I
Some observations were made as to the v
proportioning of men to each state, which h
it seems, was made according to the number t
of white inhabitants and three fifths of the t
blacks. Ta is was objedted to, and it was a- c
greed to ft left blank, until the third read- a
ing of the bill. t
Mr, Williams wished to make the calf
ling out of this detachment discretionary e
with the President. He therefore moved to t
add,where the bill speaks of organizing 80, 1
000 men, "if any subsequent measures Jhall in 1
his opinion mute it necejfary, during the recess z
of Cungrefs I
This motion was put and negatived.
Mr. Blount moved, instead of the 1
*' as soon as may be," (which related to the
calling out of the men) " at such time as the
President may think necejfary. 1
Mr. Skinner hoped this amendment ;
would be agreed to. The expence of calling I
out this detachment in MafTachufetts, he I
said, would not be less than 200,000 dollars, 1
and he could not fee any objedtion to leaving
it to the President to judge of the propri- 1
ety of putting the measure into execution. 1
The question wasput and carried4i to 30.
Mr. Sewall said, though there might,
in tht opinion of the President, be a rteceffity
for calling out a part of these men, there
might not be occasion for calling out the
whole ; he therefore moved the following a
mendment, viz. "or of any less number,
which, in his opinion, the service may re
quire."
Mr. Bloukt did r.ot know the meaning
cf this motion, except it were with an in
tention to save expence, which it would not
effeÂ£t; as, if the detachment must be made
âB,OOO menwould cost as much organizing
as 80,000. He tho't we ought at all times
to have this portion of our militia ready for
any call that could be made.
Mr. Sewall said, his intention was to
save expence. In 1794, he knew a great
expence had been incurred in MafTacliufctts,
and it had been in proportion to the number
ps men employed. ,
Mr. Williams observed that Bo,oeo
men would be about one tenth part of the
whole militia of the United States ; but if
oaly one twentieth part was wanted, little
more thankalfthe espencewouldbe incurred.
Ms. Lyon was so far from agreeing to
the present amendment, that he should wish
a clause inserted in the general militia law,
always to have this number in readiness.
Mr. Varnum thought a law detaching a
portion of the militia would rather weaken
than strengthen our force. If an enemy
were to land at any point, though it might
1* the peculiar duty of the detachment to
march to repel them, yet, as the small num
ber of these men at any one place would
probably be unequal to the repelling of an
enemy, the whole body of militia in that
quarter would at once turn out. Indeed,
the whple ought alwaystobe ready to march
at a moment's warning. Though no money
would be taken from the Trcafuvy in form
ing the contemplated detachment, it would
nevertheless be attended with great expence.
Men would not willingly turn out for four
dollars a month, when they cpuld get fifteen j
t for common labor. The difference would
therefore fall upon the State. If there was
neceflity for the measure, the cafe would be
different, but he .did not think there was any.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) agreed with
the gentleman from Mrffachufetts that the
whole body of militia ought to be held in rea
diness, and that the calling out of a detach
ment, iaftead of increasing our strength
would weaken it. Hq was i;i favor of this
amendment, because it left it with the Pre
sident to call out a smaller number. This
detachment, be affirmed, would be attend
ed with vpry considerable expence- In New-
Jrrfey, they would have to newly organize
their corps, and to make different elaffilicaÂ»
tiojis of them. Men woujd be cast for by
. lat, there would b'c much loss of time, and
coufiderable funis would be paid for fubiu
tutes. Mr, D. said he was oppoied to the
principle of the bill ; but al tliU amendment
would make it let ohje&cr.ab'c, -is - otM.ll
vote for it. .
Mr. Pi.OU..rr tlrr Â£if g 's'bP
!eem ti dittingukn between c tiling men i;i- th
to feryice, and putting t'.ie n in a state ready
to obey a call.
Mr. S, Smith was in fgvor of.thi princi- Â« x
pie of the bill. Wherever an enemy might ca
land (he spoke of an enemy landing, for t'no'
he did not believe there was any danger of n '
the kind, yet they had been called together
to provide against such an event") he doubt- 0 n
ed not the militi.i would rife at once in a bcv â¢Â»
dy i but they would go unprepared for S'
staying out more th,Â»n a few days. This de-
tachment, whicÂ»; would be prepared for the
field, would accordingly be ready to relieve an
them, as soon as they could be got together, w
He thought this a good provision ; but, if
80,000 men were thought too many, he
should not object to its being made 40,000.
Mr. Lyon was for letting the provision g e
Hand for 80,000 men ; it was preposterous 01
to talk of the danger of war, and at the fame ' 01
time, think 80,000 men too many to be held
in readiness to defend the country. \ w
Mr. Shepard thought the provision a tli
good one. '
.. Mr. Blount observed that it had been J* 1
said that militiamen had only four dollars a n '
month ; a law pasTed in 1795, he said, which
raised their pay to 6 J-dollars. h:
Mr. Hartley was in favor of holding w
80,000 men in readiness. This was done in
1794, and though he did not think we had u ,
now so much sealon to apprehend danger,
yet he would wish to be in a state of prepa- th
redness. He had no objection to leaving ce
the time of callinjr out the militia to the
O I*'
President, but not the number.
Mr. Dayton said, if the situation of
things juftified the call for 80,000 men, he as
should be the last to objeft to it; but he did h
not think it did. This aft, he said, would
operate unequally on different slates. The v
gentleman from N. Carolina, had said, it al
would be no inconvenience to his llate, it t:
would be very different in many other states. ri
In New-}erfey (as he had before dated) it |
would be felt very considerably. Men mud
have bounties, and their pay made equal to ; _
the price of labor. There would not only
be required a*new organization and claffifi- f'
cation, but also an infpeftion of arms and
accoutrements. He believed all this would
be done under this law, if it pafled, in the b
state of New-Jersey, whatever might be the j c
expense and inconvenience it would put them c
to. If he thought there was any danger, |
he would not have objected to the me afore.
He did not, however, think we should have | t
a war; and if such an event were to take i
place, ,he did not think there was a proba- 1
bility of an invasion. Our situation in r 794, (
he said, was very different. We were then ; j
not only depredated upon by the British at j
Tea, but lord Dorchelter had iflued his war- c
like Proclamation, the Indians \yere counted ,
and had their tomahawks in their hands up- _
lifted, and ready to strike ! Believing, there
fore, the measure to be unnecefiary, and
that it would operate unequally, he should
vote for this amendment, which would leave
it with the President to detach such a num
ber of men as he should believe necessary.
Mr. MacoN was Carry any amendment
had taken place, since he could not now 1
move to strike out the firft feÂ£tion of the , 1
bill, in order to fee whether the House 1
meant to pass the bill at all; for he was of '
opinion jvith the gentleman from New Jer- 1 :
fey, that there was no occasion for it. He
was certain that this business could not be
carried into effect without expence. And j
if an invasion were to take place only a few ;
of the semen could be drawn into service.
The Chairman said, that if the feafe of
the Committee was wished to be had as to |
â  the propriety of passing the bill at all, it
it might be tried by moving for the Com
mittee to rife.
Mr. Willi am â¢ made that motion.
Mr. Blount hoped the committee would not
rile. When he offered the rjfolution to the house,
he said he did not do it from any appreheofion of
' danger, but becauf lie 'bought it was necessary j
that such a number of men should be in readineis. ,
I'herc seemed teen to be little difference of opin- I
1 ion, and lie thought the principle was at that time
, fairly tried.
' Mr. Skinner hoped the committee would Jrife.
' It was well known that there was an alarm in tha
: minds of the people with refpeft to war ; and there
was serious apprehenfioi.s of war. Mr. S.-again
t spoke of the expence. He had besides another ob
jeSion to the passing of this bill. War had been
1 apprehended by many. Officers and men were a
> good deal divided with respect to the relativp situa
tion of our country; it this bill pass, they Will
l (peculate upon me^fures; they will go into difcuQp
, ins wJiich will neither tend to strengthen the gov
crament nor incrcafe good neighbourhood. He
hoped i( would not pass.
' Tha question was put and negatived, 40 to 19.
> Mr. Lyon thought iO,OOO men would Oe fuf
- ficient to oppose any force that would be bro't
J against us.
1 I'he question was thsn taken on the amendment
t of Mr. SewiW, and negatived, there being only.
19 for it.
' Mr. Varnum moved to strike out the whole
1 or the id fe<Sion, which provided for the offic-
Y ering of the militia, out of the present militia of
i- iiccrs, or others, at the option of the eonflitu-
J ticnal authority in each state."âCarried.
He also moved to strike out, as unneccHary,
' the sth feilion, which requtfted the President to
*" call on the executives of the fcveral states to take
n the mofteffeilual means, that the whole of the
d militii, not coinpnfed in the foregoing reqmfi
is tion, might be armed and equipped according
ie 'to law."âCarried.
r The committee rose, the honfe agreed to the
1 amendm-nts, and the bill waj otdered to be

Mr. P.ittis then, moved the order of the

f April 2, 1797-
SIR,
I have the pleasure to inform you, that,
in following your orders, we yesterday (close !
to the Skellock) captured a very fine cop
r ! pered French brig Le Hardi, of 18, nine-.
. j pounders and 130 men, after a chace of 7
f 1 hours. She then carried away both top
masts : it was otherwise very doubtfhl whe
t ther we should have come up with her. I
isnderftand Ihe was built at Cowe", about
' two years ago, for the Spaniards. She left
Brest the 17th of March, was soon after
chafed by two frigates, but escaped, after
many of their (hot went throilgh her' fails,
and one struck her hull. She lias only made
, t one prize, a Portugucze of little value. I

Â«< The God of nature, he who governs the

purl'uarit and agreeably to the said treaty, do here
by give notf-c. that they are ready to proceed to
baiGuif* accordingly ; and the y desire that all claims
under the said article (which lb far as the fame de-
the cafjs thereby pri-vided for, ii hereunto
annexed) r.iAy be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
They further desire that all l'ucb claims may rot
only l'tate in-Â»-hat manner the fevrrjl cases coine
within the defcriptloa of the said article, hut ulfo
fpeelal'y set forth he nature of the evidence by
which the claimantsrefpeiively undertake tafu!>-

Ex>ra<sl from the said artirie,
" Whereas it is aflcdged by divers Uritifh mer

I^HE SUBSCRIBER having been appointed by
the Envoy Extraordinary and Miuiiler Pleni
potentiary ol his Britannic Majesty, General Agent
for aflifting Britiih creditors, and lucfi particular a
ger.ts aÂ» they may specially authorise, in protecut in"
ihcir claims before the csmmoTioners Cor carrying in
to effeft the sixth article of the Treaty of Amity, Ccm
tnerceand ligation between tis Britannic i- ajejly and
the United States of America, hereby gives- notice that
he has opened his offi. e at his koufe the south efilt
coiner of Chefnut and fifth llreets, Philadelphia,
where he is ready to receive all claims or inlUuftions
for claims with the vouchers aud documenti thereof,
for the purpose of biinging forward the fame agree
ably so the rules and orders which the board may
think proper to prcfcribe.
And as it will be lor the interest of all concerned,
that the several claims be so slated, and support
ed, as to prevent the delay which would arise trom
the neceffityof obtaining further information, or ad
ditional materials,from perlons residing at a dittance,
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the
direction chiefly of those, who, not having employ
ed particular agents, may leave the profixution of
their claims ta his charge and management} that all
such claims ought in particular to fct forthâ
Â»ft. The proper description and fitnation of the
creditor or claimant, end original debtor, reflect
ively.
ad. The date or nature of the original contrast or
debt.
3d. When, in what manner, and to what extent,
the creditor or claitnaqt wis preventrd or impeded,
by the protifion, operation or delete of law, the
decifioiis Â»rii prafiice of courts, or rcflraint of exe
cution, from recovering piyment of the debt in
question.
4'h. The loss and incurrcS or fullained,
in consequence ot ftrcli impediments, whether the
fame may have arise.l from the insolvency, change of
situation, or dea'h of the debtor, the lots of legal
lemedy from lapfc of time, orothercaufe.. impairing
the value and feeurity of the debt, which would ir.it
have so operated it such impediments had not;cxille.f.
And .jth The particular grounds and reasons ou
which the claimant maintains, in the term, of the
treaty, that " by the ordinary course ol judicial pro
logs, the creditor cannot now obtain and a&a.'ly
have and receive full and adequate compcr.fstion" 101
the losses and damages so fullaiucd.
The general agent thinks it his duty further to futf
f>eft that tljr f vera! claims ought to be accompanied
and supported by the affidavits of the claimants duly
sworn and regtflarly atieilcd, both as to iUeexifltnec.
of the debts claimed, and fucb other circurnltancea
as may be within their own knowledge refpcftively.
nnd wherever th,c Claimants inflating the nature of
their evidence (which mull in every inflance be the
bell of which the cafe is capable) have occasion to
icier to the teflunony of wiieelies, it wilt be prcper
to apprifc the general agent of the names anrt plicsJ
