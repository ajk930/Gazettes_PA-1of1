S will the mote readily accommodate matters
with us"âAs much as to fay, that right and
r " jÂ»Ji" have nothing to do in the adjustment
,of the finTerenfes between the two coun
â¢d tries, so far as refpedsthe conduft of France.
4fhii is an avo\val which wa6 hardly to be

c " Portrait of a Democratic-Republican Sena
,e torâby a mtujltr
The Aurora speaking of the late eleftion
of a senator fays Â«' it is a circumstance alcr jft
ln unprecedented"âand 'â¢ that the republican
0 candidate Israel Israel is one of those
e- democrats nmft obnoxious to the fadtion ;
vice-president of the deqjocratic focietv, an
t- enemy to the prominent features of the'fede
ral government, in a word, according to the
'e indufti ions calumnies of his adversaries a
n dilorganizer, a bloody jacobin, a fomenter
the western infurredtion, every thing in
II politics th tis vile and violent." So much
for negative qualificationsâ now for pofi
-- .liveâ.He is, continues the Aurora, " a
plain man, of natural good sense, poflefTcd
t of none of those brilliant attradtions which
:- | a polished education gives. But he was the
e champion ehofen foi the occafioa by the de
s mocrats.; that was enough, he met their
t support, and has been carried into the legif
d lature against the utmost exertions of their
d adversaries in favor of B. R. Morgan ; a
young man who has been constantly inpub
-1 lie life, the foul of the party in the senate ;
1 a person of hqndforfie acquirements, and as
t a man equally refpeftable with Ifravllfrael."
Surely, as the hxifbandman said of the tares
s among his wheat, so may the democrats fay
of the writer of the above, an enemy hath
Jane this.
" Did you not moralize this fad fpeSaele K*
Oh ! no : we were busied in better fp?culationÂ«,
and did not find time to reflefl that the awful visi
tation which ft ill lingers over our demoted heads,
was not ordained without by that being
without whose notice not a -sparrow falls to the
ground.
In the old world, the Almighty hath ehofen to
visit with revolution and murder, a land long prÂ«-
â  eminently 'dillinguifhed as a " gay feat of mirth
and ease," luxury ind rev.lry, and riot, debauch
ery, and eoiruption. and every species of abomina
tion. And this modern crowd â¢( Sodoms and
r Gomorjahs now fjnarti under his avenging hand
daily ripenirg by accumulating ignorance and athe.
, ism, and new infulti continually heaped to the af
toni 1 cd fit ies, for that lad tremendous crash which
shall hurl into ncn-emity the filthy mass of far s
ealottifm. "Do we not moralize this fad fpedta
ele ?" Oh ! no ; for, drunk with the new wine of
modern philosophy, we are daily inporting from
this land of blasphemy, the feeds of death and
patriots, Â«f the new growth, who know not vir
tue nor honerty, are exalted to the high pod of 1
honor, in (lead Â«f that of forty cubits whereon di
ed an ancient enemy of the Jews.
And is ttyÂ» the course whereby we seek to fliun
the chaAifemcnt of an avenging God ? Shall we
behold the hand of the Lord, avenging himfelf '
upon iniquity in a foreign land, and must we seek
to fhiin ourfbareof ehaflifement, by aping thofo ,
crimes and importing those blaiphemies which in
duced there the (hadening rod ? " ]
If the Almighty, in pmiilhment for our iniqoi ]
tits, "and the apathy wherewith we have looked on I
the flrugglc. of the faithful, hath ehofen, by visit ,
mg us with peflilrnte, fire or famine, to exempt
us from those othir more terrible fesurges, revolu
tion, atheism and jacobinism, comparatively for - '
tunate will have bien our lot. But if, while we (
fmart.uader the lash of pedileoce and fire, we give 1
loose to wild and demoniac debaucheries, surely a |
double eurfe will be our lot.
Let us, then, moralize this fad fpe&aele; and by
a right train of"reflexion, and an aSive and ufe
ful improvement, turn our energies to the meant
ot warding off the desolating Ihock.

The faftipn which has so long disgraced ,
our country by its publications in the jaco- p
bin gazettes, continues itslaold and abandon- c
ed attacks on our independence and felf r
government. In the Aurora,of th* 14th t
inft. we find a frclh inltance of perfidious .
counsel. Encouraged by the success of for-' a
mer propositions and hints to the French c
govern ment, by which the United States f
have fuffered so severely, a new idea is thrown s
out by these internal traytors in the follow- {
ing terms, the impudence of which is exceed- ;
ed only by its folly. 1
From the Aurora. c
" But little reliance, we think, is to be
placed on the generality of the French in ad
justing the terms of accommodation. We v
have given them a leflon of thejiolly of {-
national gratitude, genero/ity, is'c. they will ;
profit by it. But we may expedt justice n
from them. In their terms of adjustment E
they will throw the burden on those who
gave them the blow. The federalilts of a
the ,east may look to their tonnage and fifh- v
eries. Perhaps the French Weft-Indies t
will be thrown open for the importation of t
Virginia and other wheat in French or I
southern bottoms; so of rice, and of tobac
co for the supply of their continental pofTef- p
lions. Such a regulation would be less dif- t
liked to the south and much more so to the ,
east, than the 70 ton article in the British r
treaty. Other regulations equally benefi- v ,
cial to the southern and injurious to the
eaftem states may be adopted by themâand t;
this they can do by, or without treaty. n
They can also lay such a duty on the fifh b
of the Ealtern Itates as to oblige them to f (
keep much of it at home which is new im- a
ported. \
Our federal and yankee president, and fe
deral and yankee chief justice ; all ourfede- b
ral yarikees, and yankee federalilts, would v ,
think this very ill, not to be treated by the ft
French as if they were friends. But will /
they go to war, because the French chufe to /,
grant an exdufive advantage to their foyth- 0
era brethren ? They will cot be so ungtne- b
- I rous, or unjust. Yet, tlx? iSduftrious, New-
England men need not fufer by fifth an. ar
rangement. He can move with his capital
I to Virginia, enrich himfclf, ani that state by
his industry, convert it to federal
I come a democratic republican himielf.
I Perhaps We (hall however- hear as much
I noise, (hould the French make this diferim-
I inatiort between eaftc-rn and southern states,
or I as took place when they made a diftinftipn
ce I between the people and the executive ; tho'
â¢ I that lucky and just diftinflion saved us from
1 I tbe horrors of war. But what then ? The
nt I French can surely grant favours to whom
n " they please, aad none have a right to take.
e - oiTeijpt in not (haring in them, provided
3e I they receive no injury. A division of the
10 Union would then once more be broached
a " by the federali/Is of the east. Butrfhey may
le quiet their heartburnings by persuading
I their friends, the Britim7 to open to them
I their ports in the Weft-Indies on the fame
I terms that tbe French may chufe to grant
to the foutherri states. This they can rea
dily do, as the British are not at all attached
' I to an increase of their navigation."

> j The following extrafts from a French
n I in answer to Paftoifet, will (hew
=" j what opinions are entertained >n France, re
le I United States. In answer to
a j the objeftions darted against a rupture with
â  r France, the writer fays Â» The United
" j States have no marine forceâfcarcely can
I their revenue cutters, armed with a mulket,
check the clandestine tradeâCongress, two
j I years ago, directed thirteen frigates to be
Â° I Jjuilt, and not one is launched. Their bed
marine officer, commodore Gillon,
e dead two yearsâtheir other sea and land
~ I officers have an honorable sentiment -of at
.r tadnunt eternal to France. Mod of the mas
" I terÂ» of their vtfTels are intrepid, but not well
I (lulled ; bold, but addidled to drong liquor.
a I The revolted colonies formerly could uotÂ»
' have maintained their independence, but by
! the land and sea officers furni(hed them by
Â» the French' government, and by the purchaf#'
of veflels and ammunition in 4775 in France
5 âby France declaring war against England
r in 1778âby the support of her fleets, the
J transport of her armies, thejunftion of SpÂ«n
and Holland, to the holy coalition against
against the British Leopard. Tn (hort, they
are indebted much for their independence, to
'â¢ j the unpardonable fault of Burgoyne and
Cornwallis, or of their indrudlioni, which
r required them to advance their armies in
â¢ land, indead of menacing and scouring the
I eoadt.
' No sooner waÂ» their independfence ac
-1 I knowledged, than their regular troops were
â  di(bandedâtheir forts levelled and dedroyed
' I ~âThe forts on the fca board were rebuilt
I ,n '794> they confid only of simple re-
I doubts of light ejirth, very easily dedroyed,
I and whose cannon can serve no purpose but
to fire evening and morning guns, falutcs,
I and to celebrate the (houts of liberty.
I In the year 1794 (amidake for' 93) the
I yellow fever ravaged in Philadelphia; in 1795
I fijes dedroyed the one half of the marine
I cities. The coWinet of St James maintains 1
j constantly in America, a horde of incendi- ]
j aries, as it keeps in pay ,in France, cut- '
I throats, chasseurs, emigrant and turbulent I
prieds. Every tide wafts from Europe a
convoy of emigrants, dedined to the western i
I parts of America, who are extended already t
Ito the Mifliffippi. In this mature of peo- c
pie, of whom one in twenty is rich, the red 1
I poor, there can be no public spiritâno nat
I tional character. The French republic has >
lon her fide the most numerous part of the t
I United States, the cultivators, who are a/1 I
I adorers of liberty. While England counts r
IoÂ» her fide, the nursery of peerage, cotnpo- v
I fed of rich planters, of avariwous merchants ; r
I the slate holders and pardoned refugeesâ j
I that is, the Canaille by excellence. The re- t
I fult of the eleftion for president has demon- c
I drated this troth. p
I The Executive Directory, if they know f
I how to use their means, and choose proper
I agents, <will have, when they please, the pre- c
ponderance which is ajftgned to the French R<- r
I public in the United States and every tvhere t-
I elft. The nereffities of our Colonies do not t
I require that France (hould make an appeal n
Ito the Anglo-Americans for supplies of r
1 provisions, since tbe profits of that trade will a
I always encourage the A me ricans to carry it o
I 011 is eveiv desirable that our colonies v
1 (hould not depend solely on the cultivators f
and stamen of the Atlantic, and that other e
I Countries (hould concur to put an end tiÂ» s tbe a
I inextinguishable thirst for gain among the c
I Americans, to our own detriment and that si
of the Spaniards, our allies. c
The fear of a war with the United States, u
however ill-founded, is not, in a political o
view, altogether useless, as it may bring fl
back to France the French capitals placed tl
in their banks, and compel our cosmopolite si
merchants to arrange themselves under the w
gl6rious banners of their country. a
The terror of fueh an appreheufion will
appear absurd, when it is considered that t<
we are from 12 to 1500 leagues distant, and b
that on a furface of 146,440 square leagues, tl
there - " were, in 1794, uC 31929,326 inha- w
bitants. f 4
_ A war with the United States would not it
give to England one more seaman, since h
there arc now in her fleets from 12 to r<
j 5,000 sailors, either impre(Ted from Aroe- a
rican veflels, or engaged, it is presumed, d
with the connivance of the United States, fj
Phe United States haveno funds for main- is
taining a war, and in cafe France (hould tl
make war, not sn the people, *who love France, di
but on the government which has been guilty of bi
so much ingratitude to her, the government tl
could not fuceeed in levying an army or equip- tl
ping a fleet, or in levying duties to pay them, pi
If the Federal government (hould be so
blind as to declare war against us, we know ti
well why the armed tyranny of England was o<
forced to withdraw into its own illand from tl
Americaâit advanced into the American coun- qi
try. We (hould not take the example for ]y
our modelâand we may be assured that the 01
boasting of the Fedsral Government would fii
- Â£oft it dear ! Its relations with Eilrop
â - would cease, and if it (hould negociat
il treaties, it would be with tribes of Indiar
y only."
:- The writer then goes on to vindicaie tli
dire dory for ordering the seizure of Ami
h rican veflels, and declares, that even if the
carry no contraband goods, the taking c
s, then? is a measure of jud retaliation for th
n evils done to France by our government.
5' He then proceeds to date that this fever
m treatment of the United States would brin
le them to propose a new treaty, which fhoul
ti be conformed to the natural interests of th
e parties. " The man felefted for this nc
d gotiafion, fays the writer, is no proud to
ie I ry, no advocate of peerage or royalty, lifc,
d bis -excellency Johu Jayâno political ma
y nequinâno American Malmefbury.
g " Madison loves his country more tha
n Franceâand the French republic more tha
ie all other countries. Liberty proclaims hir
it throughout America, as the defender 0
i- her rights in the of Representatives
d He knows that tyranny would convert tha
house into a house of commonsâthe fenati
into a house of peersâand a quadrenpia
Â»â¢ president into an ele&ive, perhaps a heredi
h tary monarchyârich men into a noblefleâ
iv the middle classes into opprefibrs and bp
pre (Tedâthe militia into feudal guardsâ
o and the mass of people into a vile herd o
h beads and (laves.
d "v It is perhaps to wieft from the peopl
n their mod zealous defender, that the An
:, glo-Americaff government has given hin
0 Tan appointment abroad. To get rid of hi
e j steady opposition, the government has dif
[t ' embarrafTed itfelf by pretending A confei
n on him a high mark of confidence.
d J " The absence of Madison from con
- grefs, and his access to the diredtory, wil
- double the strength of the friends of th<
11 two republics. The connexion of '7B, al
. most difiblved, will be drawn closer thar
to everâand the American people, escaped
r from the tyranny of their oppreflors, by
the energy of the di'reftory,' and from a
i' dependance on England, will give them
: selves up entirely to their inclination to the
1 French republic, and to the generous fenti
: ment of their independence.
1 " But, poor Paftoret, I leave you in the
t hands of the minider Adet. He has much
r more to fay to you than I have."
) Such are the opinions hi Fiance refpeft-
I ingAmerieaâfuch a mixture of ignorance
and truth, abfurditics and jacobinical mis
representations, never was before put on
paper. The piece, however, (hows by
what kind of arguments the French would
persuade themselves to make war on us,
and what calculation., they make on the

/ OF THE YELLOW FEVfcR.'
â  THIS difcafe, unknown :0 Europeans
before the difeovery of America, was sup
posed to be peculiar to the Wtft-Indics, and
part of the continent, and though
fatal experience (howed that it might exist
in temperate climates, yet it was generally
if not always supposed to be imported from
those countries where the heat olid other
circumstances concurred in
Its late ravages in Philadelphia and other
towns situated very confiderablyt6 the north
ward, threw some suspicion* on the authen
ticity of this dodtrine, and it has not only
been doubted whether the-Weft-India aK
mates only were produdKve of the fever, but
whether it wis really infeftious or not. â
These suspicions inÂ£reafed so much, and ap
peared to be so well founded, that phylicians
took different (ides of the quedion, some
contendiug that the fever was always im
ported ; others that it might arise any where
from local circtimdances.
The quedion concerning the importation
of the yellow fever is important, but much
more so is .that .concerning its infeflious na
ture. If it cannot prevail lput by importa
tion, and is infe&itius, it becomes absolutely
neeeflWy to fubjeft fea-farfng pertple to the
rigorous duty of quarantine, unpacking and
airing the goods, &c. neither, after all, can
others be fafe but by avoiding all connexion
with the vefel or those connected with it,
for a conliderable time. This must undoubt
edly be considered as a very great hardship,
and be a proportionable discouragement to
commerce ; but, on the other hand, If the
fever be not infeftious, and though introdu
ced into any place, cannot be propagated
unless in a certain (late of the atmosphere,
or when the air is infefted with pestilential
fluids, then all this precaution is uftYefs ; I
tlfere is neither occasion for quarantine nor
for separating the sick from the healthy,
which cannot be dons without a degree of
apparent cruelty..
Though these questions ought to be de
termined by physicians, yet as this hath not
been done, and both parties have publiftied
their opinions, it becomes juftinable in those
who are not physicians to judge for them
selves in this as in other matters by th'e com
mon rules of reason and sense which God
has given them. In this inquiry, we mud j
remember, that though the human race have '
a natural propensity to seek for the cause of ,
diseases in something occult and invisible, and |
far beyond the reach of our senses, yet this j
is a not diftate of reason, but a remiumt of ;
tW formef" superstition, which taugfit that '
diseases were occalioned by demons, and to
be curetl by clftrms and conjurations. If <
the matter is fairly considered, we (hall find, ;
that the modern dodlrine of mephitic airs, :
pestilential and putrid effluvia, &c. is very 'â 
apt to degenerateinto the former fuperfti- \
tion. It leads lis to believe that diseases are
oceafioned by something absolutely beyond
the feach of our iftvedigation, and confe- j
quently are to be cured by something equal- â¢
ly invisible and unaccountable. But when '
one invisible is Opposed to another, it figni- J
fies very little, whether such invifiblei arc $
ope animated or not, and on inlet is opc-.t J fol
iate ( the most dangerous quick&y. InftnncA of
lans this are not wanting even iu the present cafe
! of the yellow fever. We have seen a preventa
the tive of the fevef advertised in the newspapers
me- and strongly recommended by the advertifer|
hey ' but_ upon .what principle npbody knows.
> of T tlIS is precisely a conjuration, with this
the difference, that we are sure the words of
the conjuror can do neither good nor harm,
rcrc but we are sot sure whether the preventa
â¢ing tive may not do more harm than good. In
iuld another paper we find the old doftrine of
the Animalcule revived, and that the yellow
ne- fever is occasioned by myritds of these float
to- , ing in the air. Here, instead of the great
ike j demons of former ages, we have legions of
raa- small ones, only that thf latter, {ike the Ge
| nii and Fairies of the Orientals,,are mortal,
han The doftrine, however, leads the Writer we
ban speak of, to assign to his cures the most ex
lim traordinary recommendation perhaps ever
of given, viz. that they are dtllru&ive to animal
ires. life. In like manner the doftrine of conta
hat gion, ptitrefaftion, effluvia of any kind, or
ate in short any thing beyond the reach of our
Tial senses, leads to an unknown empirical kiud
:di- of remedies, which mult be disgusting to a
patient ; and it is absolutely neceflary that
bp- the patient have confidence in his phpfician,
sâ or he will never obey him.
of Thus much fur the pra&ice of quacks;,
. we mull now coiifider that of the regular
pie physicians who have adopted in the disease
we speak of, methods not only different, but
lim a! most entirely opposite. As the writer of
his this paper is no physician, he pretends not
iif- to determine any thing coneerningthemodes
fer of cure. He lays it down !fs a maxim, that
no physician hath any interest in killing or
on- injuring bis patient ; neither does he believe
vill that any physician would perfifl in a mode
the of praftiee which experience fiicwed to be
al- pernicious. The design of this paper is to
lan shew that patients having once called a phv.
<ed fician, ought to perfifl in the irjethod of
by cure tfrofcribed by him, ami not upon any
i a account to deviate from it. This indeed im
m- plies that ihe fame disease rtiay be cured by
he very -different, and even opposite means ;
ti- and that it really may be so, appears from
the following facts :
he i. The English physician, Thomas
ch Sydenham; celebrated no less for his vera
city and candour, than for his giedical Ikill,
ft- praftifed at London during the,.time of the
ce plague Hij66y-and 1666.' He ,fi r ft cured
iif- it by taking Jarge quantities of blood, aud
on a (litres us that by following thrs method he
by had remai kable fuceefs. Al last this rae
ild chod of hltod-letting, for whfit reason hg
is, could oot discover, became so difagreegble
he to his patients, that he found himfelf obli
on ged to give up the praftice entirely, and
m- have reconrfe to other remedies. He (jÂ£Xt
en had recourse to sweating exciting tht
in iweat by hot and ftimulating*rnedicines.-
Nothing could be more opposite in appear
ance, than these two modes of cure, and
yet tney both fuceeeded. The plague was
cured .by sweating, as well as purging.
2. With ivlpeci to the yellow fever itfelf,
ns we have undoubted testimony of its t>eing
p- cured by methods seemingly the most op
id poGte and unaccountable. JQr. Hillary, ia
;h a treat ife on the diseases of Barbadoes, men
ill tions the cafe of a furgeop't mate, who by ?
ly intemperance and lying abroad all night had
m got the yellow fever in a very severe manner,
er but was cured by qierely drinki.;g a large
n. quantify of warm water, till the enormous
er quantity of bile which irritated his stomach
H- was thrown off, and afterwards taking a few
n- doses of laudanum.. It is a well known
ly (lory of a diflipated gentleman in Jamaica,
i- that being deemed past hopes of recowry in
Jt a yellow fever, he invited his bacchanalian
- companion, to have one more liberal potati
p- on with him for the last time. Only one o
is beyed the summons. The sick man found
ic hiwfelf invigorated by the liquor he fwallow
i- ed, drank all the night, and was thus cured
re of his fever. L.afily, it haÂ» been mention
ed in the newf-paperi, that a person near
in Charleston, infefttd with the yellow fever,
h and past hopes of recovery, was cured by
a- rolling among tar, which inveloped his
a- whole body to a considerable thickijefsi and
[y could cot be got off afterwards without dif
e ficulty.
d Thus it seems to be established as a faft
n that the mcft pestilential diseases may be cuÂ«
n red by opposite methods ; and if we know
that the plague may be cured by blood-let
:- ting and by fweatitjg, that the yellow fever
>, may be cured by exjiaufting and excellively
0 debilitating Operation of vomiting, as well
e as by the most violent ftimulants,why (hould
i- it be incredible, that it may be cured by
d Dr. Rush's method Â»f blood-letting and
â , other evacuations ? TIT? cafe of the tarred
il patient may indeed be said to favqr the dot
trine of Invifihles, aud the effluvia will in
r ftantly be thought of; but by a proper con
federation of the nature of the. disease, it is
f hoped that it may be accounted for upon
much more obvious principles.
In the yellow fever, the mere colour of
t the flcin ought not to be an objeft of terror,
d as it takes place in other diseases, and the
e catife is well known to be a dilfufion of the
i- bile through the bo'dy. The causes by
- which such a difi'ufion may, he made are
1 known to< be thjte at lcaft, and perhaps
I : there may be more. One is an obflrutlion
c; in the pafTages of the bile from the gall.
f bladder to the inteftine;> .which isfhe cafe
J in jaundice.âAnother is by an excHTive and
s irregular motion of the body, as in sea sick
s ness; for this, when Jong continued and- vi
t 1 olent, makes the patient quite yellow.â
j The third is in cafe of violent heat and long
f i. continued acceleration of the blood through
, ; the liver, accompanied with a generdlo-dax
, ' ation of the body, which I suppose thciin- â¢
i j mediate cause of tin yel'ow fever, when
- ; combined with that disease which American
' pfo'ficians call fynochut. In Â«tht cafei of' v
I jaiwdice and sea-sickness the of rht
- j bile is evident, but in hot weather aifySivi
- crease of the secretion or diffufion of this
i | fluid is apparent. By-attention, how
- ever, it may be discovered. In the begin
ning of jauudice, before the flua is tinged,
ft .'Jtiis urine always apptars of a deep yellow
coloiir; in the f?a sickness it is the fame, and
ar.d even after it is over, on every occasion
of a fqyall, when the agitation of the ves
sel becomes greater than ufiial, die fame
yellowness returns. In very hot weather,
especially if violent exercifeis used; a fiinl-
ISr yellowness will beobferved, which shows
,t'nat mere heat and iricreafed motion of the
blood is capable of producing a partial dif
fufion of the bile, which would in all pro
bability become visible on did it
not get off by the urine. If, in such a (late
any person happens to be infeSled with a vi
olent fever, k is not improbable that he
might become yellow; though perhaps to
form the disease, a certain disposition of the
liver is nrcefTary, owing not to Anhnaiculx,
or imaginary ifflivia, but to ;he more e
vident eaufes of heat, relaxation, and increas
ed motion of the blood.
Thus, the diffufion- of the bile being a
symptom in itfelf accidental and not to be
dreided, but in conjunction with the fever,
it follows that whatever remedies have been
found to cure the fynochus may like wife be
fuccefsfully employed in the cure of they el
low fever; always regarding the accidental
cifeumftances which arise from the moderate
q*aantity of bile secreted, which, when
thrown in a large quantity rftto the stomach
is known to produce extreme ficknsfs, and
therefore mufl inere'fe and in a manner dou
ble the fiver with which the person is in
fe&ed, aftd make it more dangerous than it
otberwife would be; and mull likewise re
quire a difference of treatment.
If then the highest degree of fever, called
the plague, hss been cured by blood letting,
why should not the fame remedy cure an in
ferior degree of fever, though attended with
a diffufion of pile throughout the body ?
Here is neither quackery nor conjuration ;
for we may easily fee why it can do so. In
all pestilential diseases, fomcof the humours
of the ix'Hy, nr perhaps the whole mass of
blocd, is mfefted. By taking away a.large
tjiiantitity, the infeftign of course is dimio
ifhed ; the blood is soon recruited, and the
quantity newly made being prepared from
Uninfected materials, the general mass is of
a better quality than before. A second
bleeding diminifhe* the N infe&ion Hill more,
and to on. Thus may any person be con
vinced that when a phyfioian orders him to
be blooded in the yellow fever, hr proceeds
on rational principles, and hemay fafely trult
himfelf in his hands. As to the quantity of
blood to betaken away ; it mull be deter
wined by circumstances of which the phyfi- ;
â cian only c?n judge, and the patient'or 'his :
attendants, ought by no means to interfere. 1
To this may be added, that when once a
physician has been allowed to begin with
any mode of effre, the fame ought to be
persevered in, as running from one thing to
another in such cases mull certainly be at
tended with extreme dangÂ«r Dr. Syden
ham gives a remarkable instance of the bad
effects of this, in a young man infe&ed with
the ylague. He had proscribed his usual
remedy of blood-letting, and the patient had
submitted to it several times, with manifift
advantage. The doftor had infilled that it
fhdWia be repeated once more, and hÂ« would '
be out of danger ; but his friends obstinate- 1
t ly refufed ; the doftor allured them his pa
tient would die ; theydifregarded his words, '
and the young man died as had been fore- <
told. In a late paper we fee i( remarked, <
that though some have recovered who have !
lofhblood in the yellow fever, we ought to 1
have been told how many have died under *
this practice. Agreed! but even this is not : r
fufficient. We ought also to be told how j
~ many nave disobeyed their physicians ; how f
many have deceived them ; how many have 1
teized them with injudicious remondranees,
and prevented them from afting according 1
to the best of their judgment. \yÂ«re all h
these things laid open to pubh'c view, it in r
not improbable that weÂ»fliould find numbers d
of patients, or rather of their friends and
relations, mose justly chargeable with their
, deaths than the physicians they emjdfljxjL *

Communication. vile
A correspondent is for*y to fee the fatal pov
influence which the publication of fev'eral mei

hows of a thing called a role d'equipage. Those 1
f the perfous who handed said letters for publics- 1
1 dif- tion, have been instrumental in doing tnore 1
pro injury to the United States than they are 1
lid it aware of; what their views were, it is im- 1
Hate possible to tellâcertain it is, that their 1
a vi- publicity is injurious to the honor and inte- 1
it he reds of our cpuntry. The only way for us ;
ps to to get reparation for the incalculable sums 1
>f the of which we have been robbed by French (
leu/x, privateers, is to be unanimous among our- 1
ire e- selves in expressing in a dignified manner, <
:reaf- the high, sense we to a man entertain of the 1
" n j"ries and wrongs we have fuffered \
ing a from an UN-authorised decree of the v
to be French direaory, independent of, and coir- | (
ever, trary to the concurrence and opinion of the

fe be fÂ«e attempts induflrioufiy making, by inte

erate in conjutiftion with those of that class of I

and can do no wrong, tend to weaken the exer- n

MR. FENNO,
In one of your late papers it has been as
serted with confidence, that Dr- Rufli used ,'h)
mercury only as a purgative in theyellow fe- tht
verof 1793. To shew that this aflertion 6>e
is wholly without foundation, it is onlynn- w! ,
ceflary to refer to that gentlemsn's publi
cation on the fever of the above year. In t bfc
page 288, " I had observed (fays the doc- wli
torJHhat all fjich of tay patients as were sal- P u:
ivated,by the mercurial purges recovered 111
a few days. This early fnggefted at\ idea k ; R
to me that the calomel might b'e applied to C:
oth?r purposes than the discharging of bile Pre
from the bowels. I ascribed its salutary ef- ' sro
fcfts when it salivated in the firft Â«f
the difordtr, to the excitement of inflamma
tion and effnfion in the throat diverting them
/roro more vital parts of the body. In the Bri
second ftsge of the disorder I was lei to* Sch
prescribe it as a stimulant, and with a vfew ?,
of obtaining this operation from it, I aimed
at exciting a salivation as speedily as p&flible
in 'allcafes." The docontinues to ob
fcrve that ,he wa; led to the use of this rc- A
medy (mercury) in the cure of the yellow "
fever, f%m his own observation, and from 4-a!
that of ctbe'rs. . c
5?. Ir. the month of Qftober 1789, he etir<;d
a gentleman of i bilious fever by falivatin
hÂ«n, and he had found another precedent
Â«or a salivation in a fever, in Dr. Haller's
short account of the works of Du. Cramer.
He nweover adds that the propriety of tl e
- praftict received support, from the accomr. s
_ which Dr. Clarke h:id Ijtely given of the
â¢ i illqeefsful use of mercury in the dysentery.
Ir, 1 n a^ertec * ,n your paper that
I -Ur. Kulh did not bleed in the yellow feviS
-of 1793, till after iK? 10th of September.
one > "ho lias read the doftor's pub
'cat,"n on the disease, must be
that this aJTertion is equally ungrounded. He
lied in the disease as early ag the 6th of Au.
gust. See page B._Thus, Mr. Fenno, it
clearly appears, that Dr. Rufli, in the yel
â  t low fever of 1793' not only gave mercury as
a purge, but to produce a salivation ; and
that he bled in that fever on the iixth of
Augtift, instead of about the loth of Sept.
The credit of introducing in our city these
remedies in the cure of the present disease ft
due to him alone. Attempts have been
tpade -to refer their introduction to other
gentlemen of the faculty ; bus these at
t. tempts will prove abortive ; for they have
iprung from a spirit of falfehood Snd calum
ny. And to fay that Â»his gentleman intro
duced blood-letting and calomel in the cure
oi the yellow fever at Philadelphia, is only
noticing a ftnall portion of his tnedic3l fer-'
vices. By his industry and ingenuity he has
n> ffrly a total revolution in medicine.
His principles appear to be founded on
truth ; and not only embrace new views of
â¢_ yellow fever, but of diteafes in general.
J In spite df envy and malice, in spite of Eu
ropean books, and universities, these princi
ples are daily gaining groynd.i They.have
been adopted by many eminent physicians in
~ t! ? e United States, by some ih th,-' Weil-In-
| dies, and by some in Europe. And when
| it is coqfidered that-they have condufted
"to 9 more fuccefsful pra&ice, and that they
' have spread with rapidity in different parts
or the world, may we not venture to ep
tertaia the opinion, an opinion not improb
(s a,ble, or extravagant, that their adoption
*yill be finally universal ?
The following extra#, from Dr. Chif
holm's work on the malignant pestilential fe
+ ver which lately prevailed in the Weft-Indies,
will throw light on Dr. Rulh's character as
a physician and a man, and confirm the be
lief, that he is entitled to the credit of in
| troducing mercury in this city in the cure
jof the yellow fever. " Since my arrival in
I England, I have had peculiar fatisfaftion m
, finding that a treatment nearly similar to the
, above * had beeii adopted with great success
in the malignant pestilential fever, which so â¢
p lately prevailed at Philadelphia during the
autumn of 1793. Dr. Rush's medical tal
ents and merit are too well known and too
' generally acknowledged to require the fee
â¢ ble efforts of my jjen to extol them. If a
_ nv thing, however, could add to the excel
' ' enc e of thit gentlemanls chara&er, it must
be his benevolent exertion, and unwearied
perfererance during the existence of this
dreadful calamity, in relieving his kelplefs
and affljdled feflow-cjtizens, and in pnrfuing
the mercurial mode of treatment, with the
weight of prejudice and malignity in oppofu -
tion to him.v Such fortitude is rarely met
with in the medical profeflion ; and when
j it is, it must secure our admiration and res-
