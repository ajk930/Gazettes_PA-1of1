FRIDAY EVENING, OCTOBITR 6. '

/ v INFORMATION â¢ \
fÃefpecling Dr. Ruin's conduft and traiifacti
, ons during the prevalence of the malignant fe
-I)er of 1793 âCommunicated by one of the
I, Members of the College of.Phyfutans.
II P r - having tried the effects of mer-
V curial purges which he acknowledged to the
k College of Phyficianson the 26thof August,
, hnd been recommended to him by Doftors
J Hodge and Carfoti, the latter of whom had
experienced their good effects upon himfelf
on a former oqcafion in adofe CGntaininnMM
grains of Calomelâmade trial of
was so highly pleased with them that he as
sumed the credit of the discovery, though
they had been frequently employed, both by
.the Eafl and Weft-India phyficiang longbe
fore 1793, as may be seen in thÂ£ publicati
ons of Lind, Blaney, Clark, Balfour and
others.
He appears to have read Dr. ftjofely's di
rections for trating the Yellow Fever of
the Weft-Indies about the 10th of Septem
ber for the fir ft time. In that treatise very
profufe and frequent bleeding is recommend
ed from a perfuafSon that the disease was al
ways attended with inflammatory symptoms
in the beginning, which in that climate was
probably ttitf cafe as the fubjefts that came
under Mofely's care were strong vigorous
plethoric English sailors.
Dr. Rush with thatprecipitationforwhich
he has always been noted, instantly adopted
the practice in its utmost latitude without,
refledting that difference of climate and con
stitution made a difference in the disease.
On the 12th September he published in
the Federal Gjazette the following directions
to the citizens :
" Dr. Rush, regrettipg that he is unable
to comply with all the calls of his fellow-ci
tizens indisposed with the prevailing fever,
recommends to them to take his mercurial,
purges, which may now be had with suit
able directions at most of the Apothecary's,
and to lose 10 or 12 ounces of blood as soon
convenient aft*r taking the purges,* if the'
head ach and fever continue. When the
purge* do not operatie speedily, bleedirfg
may now be used before they are ttiken.â
The almost universal success with which it
has pleased God to bless the remedies of
strong mercurial purges and bleeding in this |
disorder, enables Dr. Rush to afTure his/el
low-citizens that there is no more danger to
be apprehended from it when these remedies
have been used in its early stage, than there
is from the Meazles, or Influenza. Dr.
Rush afToreÂ»-his fellow-citizens farther, tWat
the risk from visiting and attending the sick
at present, is not greater than from walking
the streets. While the disease was so gene
rally mortal, or the fuccefsful mode of treat
ing it only partially adopted, he advised his
friends to leave the city ; at present he con
ceives this advice urinecefTary, not only be
eaufe the difsafe is under the power of me
dicine, but because the citizens who now
wish to fly into the country eannot avoid
carrying the infeftion with themâthey had
better remain near to medical aid and avoid
exciting the infeCtion into aCtion."
How far the assertions contained iu the
address correspond with faCts, let the obitu
ary of that month determine, and the deaths
in his own family.
'Those acquainted with the cÂ«ufes and
laws of contagion thought him insane.
At other times he promised a removal of
the iafeCtious effluvia, with which he aflerted
the whole atmosphere was loaded, as soon as
a heavy rain should fall. An opinion as
groundless as any that ever was generated
in a whimsical brain. ,
Immediately after one of his addrefles to
the citizens, the following advertisements
were published by his request in all the
newspapers. - \
" Dr. Rush's celebrated mercurial purging
and sweating powers for preventing and cu
ring the prevailing putrid fever, may be had
carefully prepared, with proper directions
at Betton & Harrifons, No. 10, South Se
cond street.
Dr. Rush's mercurial sweating purge for
the Yellow Fever, may be had carefully
prepared, with the doCtor'i directions, and

mist, &c.

the Yellow Fever, with printed directions,
prepnred and fold by permission, by Gold-Â»
thwaic & Baldwin, Chemists and Druggists,
See.
In speaking of his exploits in a letter a<f
dreffed to Dr. Rodgers, dated OCtober 3d,
after accusing most of the physicians in the
city of ignoranceandobftinacy.he adds," by
means of the remedies' before mcfitioned, I
think I havVbeen the unworthy instrument I
in the hands of a kind providence of rccov- |
ering more than 99 out of an 100 of my pa- I
tients before my late indisposition from the !
want of bleeding and purging. Since the
1 Oth of Sept. I hsjve found bleeding in ad
dition to the mercurial purges necessary in
19 caies out of 20. At firft I found Jhe
loss of 10 or 12 ounces fufficient to subdue
the pulse, but J have been obliged gradually
as the season advanced to increase the quan
tity t.o 60, 70 and 80 ounces.'?
So much was the Dr. about this period
poffeft with the notion that he was the on
ly man of common sense "existing, that he
not only refufed to consult with any but
his former pupils who submitted to obey
his dictates, that he rudely intruded his
advice upon other people's patients ; he also
appointed two illiterate negro men and sent
them into all the alleys and bye-placcs id
the city, with orders to bleed and give his
sweating purges as he empirically called
them, to all they should find sick without
regard to age, ftx or conftftution. And
* These purges cot timed 10 grafts of Calo- 1
mtl and 15 of jfulap. ;
bloody and dirty" work they made among
the poor miserable Creatures fell-in their
way.
"That his mind was elevated to a state of
snlhuliafm bordering on phrenry, I had fre
quent opportunity of observingâand I. have
heard from popular report, that in palling
through Kenfinyton one day with his black
man on the feat of his chaise along fide of
.him,he crided out with vociferation, " bleed
fend purge all Kenfingion !" drive on boy !"
The contemplation bf his own felf creat
ed consequence, the hurry of business, the
novelty and solemn afpedt of the furround
mg scenes, had certainly a very extraordi
nary effeft upon his imagination and impair
ed his judgment.
'hat he terffied into chil
vinto
Wfenvulfions, by flopping thÃPin the m-ec t
and declaring they had the feverâYou've
got it ! you've got it ! was his usual faluta
tation upon feeing any one with a pale coun
tenance. I have been assured that he pro
nounced to Dr. Qlentworth, that he would
be a dead man if he would not submit to
more bleeding, after he had reduced him al
most to death's*Â«door by the violence of his
remedies.* Two other physicians being
called in, thought otherewife, and the DoÂ£l.
recovered without any more loss of the vi
tal fluid, not with [landing this alarming and
positive prognofticatiofl.
His pronouncing Mr. Michael Connor to
be infedied with the yellow fever, when
just recovered from the ague and fever, oc*
cafioned a relapseâThe fame gentleman as
cribes the loss of his amiable daughter to
the drastic operation of his mercurial purges.
WhÂ«n applied to by Mr. Chancellor to
visit a patient with Dr. Hodge, he advised
him to dismiss Dr. H. for he was a bark
and wine Do&or, and would do him more
harm than good.
Dr. W. he said was an aflaffin, because he
expressed some doubts of the superior effica
cy of mercurial purges to those of a less
drastic kind. 1
In hiÂ» letiÂ«r to Dr. R*vdgcÂ», after treat
ing.the ajjinibiia of*ll his fellow praftition
crs with the mofl insulting contempt, and de
claring that he believes himfelf the unwor
thy instrument in the hands of a kind pro
vidence of recovering more than 99 of an \
100 of his patients, he adds, "it was ex
tremely unfortunate that the new remedies
were ever conilefted with my name," and
that he claimed no other merit than that of
having early adopted and extended a mode
of treating the disorder which he had learn
ed from his firft preceptor in medicine Dr.
Redman, and which is strongly reeommend
ed by Hilary, Mofely, Mitchel, Kirby, and
many other writÂ«rs on the fever."
The Dodtor certainly intended to write
a romance, for there is no mention in any
of the authors he refers to of mercurial pur
ges, or of resting the cure of the disease on
copious bleeding and purging, or that God
had blefled copious bleeding and purging
in their hands, as any person that can read
may fatisfy himfelf. Mofely indeed de
pends much on copious bleeding in cases 1
where the inflammatory symptoms arc mani
feft, but all the reft inculcate sparing bleed- 1
ing and the most mild purges The recol- 1
left ion of things were not to his 'pur- 1
post, hence thfe convenience ofhaving agood <
momory at forgetting things that would <
prove obftacle6 to our fche.meÃâAll good j
democrats acquire this kind of memory. 1
The Doftor here remembered to forget <
the information be formerly acknowledged 1
he had received from Doftors Hodge and 1
Carson, refpefting the efficacy of mercurial 1
purges in bilious cases. He also remember- j
ed to forget having seen the good ,effefts t
produced by "Weeding a fat cook in Water c
ftrcet, the day after he had threatened to t
prosecute Dr. Barnwell for a design upon j
the life of Mrs. Rofs in Walnut street, be- ! f
cause he blod her in the very fame kind of ] I
fever that he now applauds it in, and em- c
ploys as a cordial and anodine, and in def- c
perate cases, to make the patient die easy. \
He also remembered to forget to mention, r
that he adopted his sanguinary code not a
from Draeo but from Mofely, who was a c
mere empiric that praftifed in Jamaica some 1
years ago. c
He dfo, in a most extraordinary manner,
remembered to forget the viftims that were '
falling by the hands of his apostles, at the a
very time ( that he was boasting of recover
ing more than nituty-tiiae of a hundred.
To crown all his extravagances, he has
lately threatened to prosecute Dr. Hodge Â£
for telling Dr. Way, on the 2d day of
his fever, that he thought he might recover n
without any more bleeding. The cafe of j
Dr. Way is briefly this:-âHe was attacked j
on Sunday with the usual fymptomp of the r
prevailing fever; bled himfelf in tfie night
about 12 ounces; next day was bled.by t
advice of Dr. Rush three times ; took mer- j l
curial purges, which operated very copious-
ly ; on Tuesday had an intermission ; was
again bled once, and purged several times. c
On Wednesday he took without advice 8
grains of mercufius dulcis; had all along
since the attack observed the most abftemi- "
oifs and cooling regimen. By whose direc
tion he was bled on Wednesday I do not
know, for Dr. Rufli did not visit him after \
dinner that day. The mercury that he h
took of his own accord on Wednesday 3
morning, brought on pain, sickness and ii
spasms in his bowels, and occafiontd such tl
extreme debility that he funk under it, and a
expired on Friday evening. The account h
of the treatment till Wednesday morning, ji
the writer had from Dr. Way himfelf. o
From this statement, I think Dr. Rflfli
exempt from blame in the cafe of Dr. W^y; o
and that there are cases of high inflamma-- J 1
tion in which the patient sometimes reco- 18
vers, under the most herculean discipline, I
his moil inveterate enemies mutt ackuoW- 0
ledge. ~ I' 1

Â» in a late publication, has loft but one patient
out of seventy in the prevailing fevtr. It

[That those " unfuecefsful praftioners"
<â  who have persevered to this time, in the hor

i- the inevitable deduftions to be drawn from

As to any' uncommon, or set mode of

' ra S ' n g Diseases,
1 nr the *er. dr. colvn,
f WE have passed through many forrowful
e j weeks, and we have reafcn to apprehend fur
- ther attacks from the /hafts that so cruelly
. afflift our mortal frames, and wound our
- fouls to the quick, by the loss of our-deareft
i friends. How far the efforts of man may
delay that diflblution which mult finally fe
e parate us from this world, we know not ;
r but it is a duty to preserve all pro
- mifing means ; and also, to smooth the paf
i sage of the grave. Extreme fiifFerings 6f
1 departing friends, impress a sadness On the
( heart that cannot soon be obliterated, tho' -
1 '.ve know that they were nothing in compari
son to thefucceeding and permanent fullnefs
sos joy. â 
PublidWTlrefs demands public attention ;
- every perlÃn is in confciencc bound to fur
- nifh what information he can. Was this
- done more generally, muih light would be
1 collefted, and best physicians would re
l ceive aid from the observations of candid and
I judicious persons. I
! 1 The present epidemic is, like that of '9,
: aiverfified in many forms and degrees.âit is
I more or less bilious, nervous, putrid, or fn
l flammatoryâ it affefts the stomach, head,
I ( back, differently : in general, all fevers in
â  America are thus varied, by seasons, conftj
-1 tutions, local circumstances, &c. Thisprin
cible being undoubted, it is imreafonable to
fj treat this disease in a uniform manner. The
proper y&Jlow fever is by no means the most
_ 1 frequent of these varieties, and the worst
species is rare. 1 his disease is, indeed, one
of the least known, because it does not oc
â  cur in the most civilized parts of Europe,
which have many excellent physicians. Toe
1 medical authors who have seen it jn the East
aqd Weft-Indies, are few : the most judici
-1 ous among them confefs their obfeure know
ledge of it ; arid the others disagree in opini
on. In the beginning its appearances are
seldom so striking as to show its real quality.
Whenever these are doubtful, violent mail'
agement is wrong, because more harm may
be donethancan be repaired by analteredme
thod. Extreme evacuations may be proper
in a few cases, but Ihould by no mean'') be j
general rules, becauf- we know not whether
. they can reach the morbid cause ;or whether
exhaustion may not disable the powers of
. nature from a necessary co-operation. Mo
derate bleeding and purging is at firft fafeft.
Immoderate purgings are not sure means of
removing that vomiting fe- dreadful in this j
fever, as I have fonnd in many cases. 'Quef- 1
tionable mineral medicines are, undoubted
ly, hurtful to many confutations. The
moft/nild among the vegetable are also pre
ferable, if they can keep the bocfy fuffi- '
ciently open, because they do not increase '
the irritation of the intestines. J

Tuesday afternoon a court was held for
the examination of John Perry, charged
with being concerned in fitting out and arm
Â» ing a veflel within the United StaUs.'for
r . the purpose of cruifirfg against the fubjefts
j. of a nation with whom we ate at peace,
le &c
---ie Ihe most material evidence for the pro
,s fecutioti was Captain Willis, whose teftimo
it n T was in substance as follows:âthat in
the month of January last, on his homeward
d bound passage from Guadeloupe, he spoke
a new copper bottomed schooner from Nor
e wich in Couneaicut, called the Uncas, with
i. mules "P on her deckâthat on his'returning
;e I to Giiadaloupe, some time after, he found
Â»_ that this schooner had been converted into
j_ a piivateer, and had taken some prfzes, par
u ticnlarly a (hip called the Betsey of Glasgow
âthat in aconverfation he had with Perry,
q he said he was on board the schooner when
ir spoken by him in January, and fuy.hef"ae
n knowledged that he was then ijiterefted in
said schooner, as a privateerâthat Perry
,f, was publickly spoken of at Gaudiloupe as
,J part owner and agent for the privateer,
which was then called the Victorious.
Q Mr. Murray's teilimony corroborated in
y slating the prevailing opinion at Gauda
r. laupe, of Perry's being und-rflood as part
" e owner and agent for this privateer
i, ; After a full and candid hearing of evj
,f i dence and the refpeftive counsel employed
o ; upon the occalion, the court were of an un>
] animous opinion that Perry's cafe eame un
e 1 der cogizat.ee of a law of Congress paffcd
e | 11 \>4> which fuhje&s citizens of the Uni
- jjed States guilty of the offence ior which
" nie wsis indi&ed, to imprisonment of not
t more than three years, and a fine not excee
y ding 5000 dollars.,
â¢- The'court admitted Perry to bail on his
a Â£' mn S security in the sum of* 5000 dollars
foj- his appearance at the Federal Court to
b~ held in the diftrift of Virginia, to which
a final decision is referred.
1/ Before the fame court, Mr. Robert Hara
j ikon, of this town, was examined on a
j charge not very dissimilar to the above. The
,J only evidence' adduced in this cafe was his
. own â  >hiiitary confelTion. Sjindky moniing
y ! Mr. Hamilton meeting several
r ; on his wharf, he defiired that thev would
t step into his counting room, where he obfer
y ved to that underftandirig a report
. ; w?Â» in circulation that he had been concern
. i ed in a privateer, fitted out of Â£he United
. States, was desirous ofreprefenting the mat?
ter in its true light, in order that they
f might contradift any misrepresentation
e .which the'tongue of rumour would
' bly originate. He then stated that in the
. ! year '93, a friend in Baltimore, without
s i fjjs knowledge or advice, purchased a part
in a privateerâthat he was firft informed
; of this circumstance by letter, stating qKo
. that he was considered as interested in a
5 third pirt of the purchaseâthat he accord
. iflgly gave his friend, who was indebted to
. him, Credit for that proposition of the share
[he brought in'the privateer (as he shewed
by his book, 1 ) amounting to 48 8/1 that
t he afterwards received through him, 900
. dollars, as a dividend of a prize made bv
. said privateer, iince which he hat! not heard
( further of her than a report that (he was
, captured and destroyed by the enemy.
The attorney remarked that a prgfecution
would not lie, inasmuch as it was required
, bylaw, that it (hould be commenced in
two years after the commifiion of the offence
but that the court might demand security
against , the'repetition of it." The court
coincided with the attorney in regard to the
point of law; but bound him to a sum of
2009 dollars, being unanimously of opinion
that be had been guilty of a high misde
meanor. '

Â« The question of recovering, against
the underwriters on where the (hip,

condemned in France, together with the
cargo, for not being documented, agreeably
to the treaty .between the two countries,
has Veen tried in the court of king's bench,
in the cafe of the Commerce, warrauted
American (hip, bound from Lilbon to Lon
don, and carried into Nantes, and there
condemned on that ground. Lord Kenyon
held, that every man was bound to conform
to the laws and treaties of his own country;
that in warranting the (hip neutral, or A
"merican, he obliged himfelf to prove her
qualified with every document necefTary by
their laws and treaties, to support her neu
trality and that it she was condemned for
any default in them, the warrant .was not
made out, and consequently the under
writer was exonerated. This decision is
conformable to some precedents established
last war by lord Mansfield, in cases of other
neutral vcffels under similar circumftapees,
and was generally txpedled. But it will
involve much American property insured
here, and leave the owners no chance of
redress, but from the trench government.
It is matter of great surprise hjre, that
your citizens have exposed so many of their
vessels to confifcation, by negleaing to pro

of 177R acknowledges to be necefTary, in

TO THE PUBLIC.
In a letter lately published in Mr. Fen
no's paper, I came forward with thf initial
of my surname. This I have since had
reason lincerely to regret. William Cobbett,
after announcing this letter, in a manner
highly illnatured and ungentlemanly, has
thought fit, not only to republilh, but most
strikingly misrepresent it.
In the fifth sentence, in the third line,
the words he has, Mr. Cobbett has
inserted the word long, which is not in the
original letter ; from a review of which, it
will appear evident, that this word must
have been an intentional addition. To
place this in a clear light, and to put it be
yond all doubt, it is only necessary so ob
serve, that he has printed the words he has
long* (differently from'the origmal) in ita
lics ; and at the bottom, has added a com
m,ent. on the very word by himfelf interpo
lated ;' which comment is wholly inapplica
ble to any part of the letter, as it appeared
in Mr. Fenno'cs pajjfir.
Trifling as this circumstance may appear,
it is evident that it must be considered as a
matter of no small importance. If a printer
is at liberty thus to alter and misrepresent
a piece, the contents of which he may hap
pen to dislike ; âif, to suit his own pur
poses, he can thus fhamefully and malici
oiifiy mutilate the publications he may meet
with ; and all this under the fan&ion of the
liberty of the press beware, fellow citi
zens, how you eommit your communica
tions to the public.
And what must be your opinion of the
honor ajid integrity of the man, who, if
he has nothing else' to lay hold of, (loops
to such mean and despicable (hifts, in order
to give vent to a malignant disposition. I
therefore call on Mr. Cobbett, if he is pof
fefled of a particle of candor, publicly to
retrah this misrepresentation. I well know
that in coming forward in the public papers,
I lay myfelf open, not only to his, but to
every other person's animadversions ; and I
cheerfully leave him at liberty, to comment
on, to republish, and to abuft, any and
"fcvery thing I may write in futdre ; but in
justice to the public, to him and to myfelf,
I entreat him to do it without perversion
arid misrepresentation.

danger, on account of the Fever, surely no
man need be under apprehensions on that
fsore ; As it is only necefiary to go to the
State-House, and depoiit the vote, which
may be done in a few minutes, without invol
ving a necessity for the lead exposure tp in
fection. Ask yourselves, citizens, upon a
question, whether you will choose good men
to tranfaA your important publie concerns,
or have bad men forced upon you, if the
the cafe be not worth your carj. ,

The Editor, pre tempore, of this paper,
having, in the ordinary eourfe ot his proses- !
fion, experienced a moll extraordinary and
novel alTault, in a persecution coirtmeneed a
gainst opinion, by one who thought proper to
construe to his own prejudice certain para
graphs which appeared at different times in
this Gazette, thinks it proper to declare to
the public, that althr.' he is determined* to
hold no measure with an open enemy, yet,
as his views ever bsen dire&ed to the
propagation of fnch truths as may be ufeful
to us in our political or social state, he of
fers, himfelf as the impartial organ through
which the sentiments of the opposite parties
may be communicated to/ the public. As
a thorough knowledge of the nature aird
tatment of the -pre sent malady, is of the
highest importance to the welfare and hap
piness of this eountry, lie invites the com
munications of those profelfiarial and litera
ry gentlemen, whose experience and know
ledge may throw light on this interesting
fubjes. On a point of such general dif
cuflion, and on which he, like many others,
can fay but too mtieh from fatal experience,
it is to be expected that every one will have
forpied some opinionâyet, as that opinion
may be founded on partial" fafts, or partial
representations, he is willing to renounce his
own in favor of "those ev.i: of his persecutor,
when the latter (hall have acquired the sanc
tion of experience and generjf
But as a question of a much bfglflF nature, 1
than the good or ill will of a weak, petulant
individual, is implicated in the process insti
tuted against the editor, he feels himfelf
bound in duty and honor, as a member of
this free community, to adhere to his wont- (
ed Jine of conduft, and to give to the world
the sentiments of his correspondents, with
out ftipuldting fÂ«r the language in which
they are to be cloathed. He ever has bten
and will be careful not to touch persons, and
as for opinions he cannot but thijjk that,
maugre all that Sangrado can fay or do,
they must and will (hilt for themselves.
v
The Jacobin faction, curious to relate,
are about attempting something new and
before unheard of. A- new political denomi
nation is to be instituted ; and to back the
foi-difant republicans in their noxious
schemes, we are to have a publican exalted
into the Grand Council of the Common
wealth.
