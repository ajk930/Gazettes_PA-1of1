I. CONSTANTINOPLE, June 10.
A conspiracy has been made to dethrone the

in the mofejues.
The camps in <he neighbourhood of Adrianople ,
am&unt to 300,000 men, with a so; midable train

The Ottoman squadron, cor.fifting of 6 ships of
the lice, 2 frigates, and a corvette, is not to be
commanded by c?pitana bey, or sice-admiral ; the
captain pscha himfelf will command, who now
thinks himfelf fufficlcntly firm in the good graces of
his royal mailer, to venture an absence from the
court, and fail into the White sea, regardless of ,
his domeflic enemies
7. he French ambafiador found His court infultcd
by an omission of the captain paeh a , who , when |
he l.oifted his flag, and, out of compliment, ihofe ,
of all the principal maritime powers of Europe
omitted thareeremony only to the flag of France'
Verninac piefented a very spirited memorial upon' i
the subject, which thS minister of Kate afTetfed to
treat with levity > but finding it insisted on by the I
French ambassador, the Ottoman Porte declaimed !
by the admiral himfelf, any intentional difrefpedl to ,
the republic, and ordeied the captain 0 f the (hint*
be pot in irons. The-Trench amb.fTador '
went lumfrff on board to, keg .he captain', Ijben.- i
tion, and he was falutedl with 9 guns by the * hole '
fleet, which betog unusual, furnifhtrd a rctu-r of
jealeufy to the other atnbafiadurs.
Ed The Allele lqusdron is equipped completer in
a- the European stile. The commander himfeW 14 not
it- acquainted with his dedication, not being to open
' his hiÂ» difppjchcs till he arrives at the Dardanelles.

if- j agaiuft the rebel pacha of Acri, who has extorted
i great sums of money from the fahjt&s of the Porte,
lie Â«f which, in the present jundlure, they hive great
i), need. What particularly points to this obj-dt ij,
>f the quantity of land and ordnance ammunition,
:d which it would nÂ«t be neceflary to fend on bo*rd a
fleet destined only to crsife in the Archipelago,
t, Councils ef state fit hers frequently and long, tip
es on â¢ccaliou of a family alliance between Russia and .
p. : Sweden, either concluded or ready 10 be so, which
in hat deranged the interest of this empire extretnely
âwe having teckuned upon the completion of the
treaty of subsidies opened lad year with that power.
Another objeÂ£ of icfle&ion is, the progress of the
war between the Ruffian*-and Perhain, uniformly
in favour of the former power : also the affuranca
that the Poles were disposed to make a new and vi
~ goretis reliftancf, with the aid of the Turks, which
would certainly be given, If the negeciations were
j. completed with other powersâevents which cannot
fail to operate this most important changes in the I
politics of the Ports.
. The Cenfeur, French frigate, is failed for the
Archipelago, to cruise againfl the enemv, which
P indeed (he may e;tfily do, there being no Euglifh

, us pay dearly for the veflcls we captured belonging
to that state.

BOLOGNA, June 25.
Ofl the 19th inft. about ten in the .morning, it
was that the French, under the command of Gen.
Angerau, entered this city. A corps, confiltingof
KJOO men, took possession of the town and garri
son, in the name of the French Republic. The
army were encamped at the distance of one mile.â
Buonaparte and Salicetti arrived next day, and dif
mtfTed the papal garrison.
Buonaparte, after a severe reprimand for having
ordsred a young Piedmontefe to be put to death ori
a charge of revolutionary principles, rppriffd the
Cardinal Legate, M. Vincttti de VidVi, that his
ferviees coirtrT He difpentel'Vrith, ordered him to
depart for Rome. This order was instantly obey
ed by the cardinal.
On the 20th, the senate ifTned a manifeSo, de- ' ,
elaring that the city of Bologna was permitted by
the commander in chief of the French armies to
resume their ancient rights and privileges, that the
legiflattve and executive authority was veiled whol
ly in the senate, who fhou'd exercise it under the
controul of the Republic of France, that the se
nate was ready to reinstate in their refpedtive offices Â£)
all that were invested with the administration of tlw
civil and criminal jurisprudence, and that they re

" I have been informed that Mr. Edmund Ran- h

It thus appears that Mr. Fauchet was corredily "
informed, -when he fuidvthat Mr. JeJferfon was the "
man on whom the patriots were turning their e\es
as a fuccejor to the President 11 is not impossible s
that fadts hereafter may be developed, which will ir
fhe.w that Mr. Fauchet's declaration was equally
