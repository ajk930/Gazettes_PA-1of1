Mr. Coit asked and obtained leave of
a'ofence for three weeks: â
Mr. Claiborne alked andobtained leave
of absence for his colleague, Mr- Clay, who
foroe days ago received an account of the
death of Mrs. Clay.
Mr. Otis presented a petition from the
freeholder*'and other inhabitants of the town
of Brooklyn, in the (late of MaiTachufetts,
praying that merchant's vessels -may not be
allowed to arm, and that such means may
be taken as (hall prevent the United States
from being drawn into the vortex ofthe Eu
ropean warâReferred to the .committee of
the whole on the state of the Union.
Mr. W. Claiborne reported a bill di
reftingthe payment of a detachment of mi
litia for fervieos performed in the year 1794,
Under major James Qrr, which was commit
ted for to-morow.
The bill for the relief of Reuben Smith*
"Nathan - Strong and Pierre Atfpoix ; and
the bill for the relief of Obadiah Brown,
were read the third time and pafled.
A bill from the Senate, authorizing the
President of the United States to raise a
provilional army of 20,000 men, was read
the firft time ; and upon motion made to
read it a second time.
Mr. Nicholas objected to the feeond
reading of the bill ; as he believed it poflef
fed a principle which could not be afiented
to. He moved, therefore, that the biil be
rejefted. He did not believe it was necessa
ry to pass a bill of this fort under any polfi
ble modification. The highest aft of legisla
tive power was, by it, proposed to be tranf
ferred to the Executive, viz. the power to
raise an army, which he was to exe,reife at
his pleasure. If an army was necessary, the
legiflatuie ought to raise it; but he did not
think it was necefTary at ptgfent, Indeed,
when difcufiing the bill for providing a na
val armament, gentlemen had said that mem
bers had been willing to make preparations
for defence on the land, where there was
n6 danger, but were unwilling to do it at
sea, where the greatest mifchief might be
expeCted. He did not believe thsre could
be any necefiity for going into a measure of
this kind at the present session. In cafi of
predatory attack, the militia would be equal
to repelli-g them. Mr. N said he lived in a
part of the country perhaps more defence
lefs than any other ; but so far as he or his
constituents were concerned, he did not wirti
for a foree of this kind. He was willing to
confide for defence on the militia of the
country.
Mr. Oris thought it very extraordinary that
the gentleman from Virginia should endeavor to
furprizea part of this house into a drcifitjn upon
thii bill in this stage of it. He hoped he would
consent to its taking the nfual course. The
gentleman had gone into the meriti of the bill ;
Ite~ cointnioi. T,>j?3ure ne hxrt not
heard it read ; so fir as he did hear tt, he war
of opinion that the gentleman hid anticipated
objeit ions which did not lie against it. He Teem
ed to luppofe that this bill declared that a (land
ing army (honld be raised. It does no such thing ;
n only declares that if existing circtimftances
(hall make it neetflary, then the President (hall
raise an ;rmy not exceeding a certain number of
men. It may happen that the necefiity will not
exist ; but the gentl*man from Virginia must be
able to fathom the intentions of France further
than he could pretend to do, if he could fay that
no such neceflity would exist. If what was said
by the agents of that government to Our Envoys
could be relied on, there was a dire<?l threat to
ravage our coafls. He hoped, however, no in
vasion would take place ; but whence said this,
he calculated upon the French ailing as reason
able beings, but he perhaps calculated delusively.
Indeed they are now threatening the invafioÃ of
a country, where one may suppose they would
have as little chance i f succeeding as in this
country; and was the idea then to be so much
fcoflVd at, as not to fuffer a bill intending to
provide against it to be read a fecend time ? If
the arms of our citizens were to be cied up, and
our militia were many ef them without arms,
with what ftiould we oppose such an attempt if
it were made ? What, (aid he, is to prevent
ViflorHugifts fending overtwo or three frigates;
it had been said that he expe&ed open war, and
that he was ready for it ? In short, he thought
it would be the most difgracefui condudl that
ever was attempted in that house, if the bill
(hould bÂ« rejefled without a (icond reading. It
would be in vain to talk of unanimity, if a bill
from the Senate was to be treated in this way.â
If the gentleman persisted in his motion, he
trusted he would find himfelf nearly alone.
Mr. Gallatin wondered the gentleman
from Mafiachufetts (hould be so greatly surpris
ed at a motion of this kind, because if he had
attended to the rules of the house, he would
have found that it was a course expreisly pre
fc-ibed by them.lthad been ailed on before dur
ing this session. The principle he said was well
undcrftood. When a member disapproves of
the principle of a bill altogether, and does not
wish to go at all into a discussion of the detail,
he moves to reject ii before it goes to a second
reading.
This bill goes to authÂ»rize the President to
raise an army. He did not know what was
ifieant by a provisional army. He did not find
any thing said in the constitution of the United
States relative to provisional armies, or of giv
ing the President power to raise armies. Ht
found mentioned there no other kind of defence
than an army and militia. It fays Congress
(hall raise and support an army, not provide for
the raising of an army ; but this b'll is to enable
the President of the United States to raise an ar
my .The constitution has (ieclared that the raising
of an army ib placed in Congress, but this bill
goes to declare that this power (hall be veiled [by
(aw in the President. Tflat is the principle of the
bill ;& if Cougrefs were once to admit the prin
ciplethat they have a right to veftjn the President
powers placed in their hands by the constitu
tion, that instrument wpuld become a piece
of blank paper. If it were to be admitted
in one cafe, it would be admitted in another;
and if admitted in one department, it might
be admitted in another. The power to raise
taxes, he said, fs contained in the fame article
of the canflitution, which fays Congrels (hall
raise armies. And if they could del.-gate the
power of raising an army to the President,
why not do the (anie with refpedt to the power
of raiting taxes ? He supposed the house
v. otild next hear of provisional taxes, to be
Milled if the Frefident fh.ill think fit. Mr. G.
therefore thought the principle inadmillible.
If the circumstances oi the Union required an
army; let it be raised; if not, he wished to
give no power to raise it ; especially as the
President, if he saW necefTary, could call Con
gress together, if he (hould find that the cir
cuiMances of the country required "it. Mr.
G. thought the house had already decided
that no additional army was necelfary at pre
sent, in agreeing to an additional regiment of
artillefry ; as the leleit committee, when they
brought in that bill, had the report of the Se
cretary of War before them, which dated, be
sides the regiment of artillery, that other ad
ditional force would be necelfary, and having
reported no other, U Wis to be (uppoled they
thought-no other necefTary. But if it was
thought, tlie lioule had not gone far enough,
he was-wllling to go .flinhei", but not willing
to transfer their power to judge of the pro
priety of raiting an army.
Mr. Dan a hoped this bill would not be re
jetted on its firft reading. It required no la
boured arguments to prove that the motion
might be made; but more than had been ad
duced to (hew that it ought to be adopted.â
He thought the gentleman from Mafiachufetts
ought not to have been surprized at this mo
tion, because it was best calculated for excit
ingalarm. . It was said the Senate proceeded
in a similar way on the bill sent up from this
Houle for a repeal ps the (lamp adi; bu.t that
queliion had already been agreed upon in the
Senate on a diftintt proposition, and there was
therefore no necefiity tor going again into if.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania had said,
that when the house agreed upon an
al regiment of artillery, they negatively deci
ded against any other (landing force. The
gentleman might put what confirmation he
pleased upon that vote; he could aflure him
for himfelf than he had no such idea when he
voted.
This bill, Mr. D. said, provided for the
raising of a regular force, 111 cafe the Presi
dent (hall think the situation of tlw country
requires it; he is al.fo authorized to accept of
the ferviees of volunteer corps. The bill
could be amended in any manner which gen
tlemen thought proper. But the gentleman
from Pennsylvania does not know what a pro-,
visional army means. He believed this was
no new principle; he believed it wa? attad
upon when the three additional regiments
were raised to the then existing corps. It was
in principle the fame as when an army is di
rected to be raised, but where the President
has power given him to'fufpend the raising of
it, if he (hall fee necelfary.
Mr. Sewai.l said, that though the present
motion be not irregular in point of form, yet it
is a manner of proceeding very objectionable
at this time. His colleague had complained
of this motion bsjng afurprife upon the house.
He had good reason so to conlider it. And
the House will consider whether it is expedi
ent, without entering into a consideration of
the bill, without feeing whether any'altcrati
ons could be made in it, (o as to render it more
agreeable to gentlemen, thus to attempt to
#Â£droy the bill. What was the .motive of the
gentleman from Virginia in making the moti
on, might easily be discovered. He had ob
tained leave of absence, which might have a
tendency to hurry him in his political course.
He wished to be heard on this subjeCt; but
this hurry of his to return home ought not to
hurry the House in its proceedings. Those
gentlemen who had determined to take this
course had the advantage of others who were
unprepared for such a motion.
This bill was said to be unconstitutional â¢,
but it wss.obferyable that gentlemen did not
themselves -râ objection. or they
would "Â° r Have had recourse to others of lit
~ne conl'equence. Mr. S. denied that the
House had already decided that ho farther ar
my was necefTary. When the committee for
the proteflion of commerce, and the defence"
of the country, had the additional regiment
of artillery under consideration, they had not
before them the report of the Secretary of
War, which.the gentleman from Pennsylva
nia had mentioned; that measure was ground
ed upon a resolution long since referred to
them. What, he asked, was the amount of
the objections. to this.bill! Will it be said
that the House cannot authorize the Presi
dent to begin to raise an army two months
from this time \ And iffo,. may they not fay
he may doit upon certain contingencies 1 But
if gentlemen relied upon this objection,, they
might fay that an army (hould be raised, but
not until a certain time, or until a certain',
contingency (hall have taken place.
With refpett to the expediency of the mea
sure, there was a great variety of opinion.â
Some gentlemen think the danger of our si
tuation greater than others; some think it is
not only probable that predatory attacks will
be made, but that part of our territory may be
taken pofTeflion of. If we were to discover
the fleets of Franee approaching with an in
tention of landing men 011 our shores ; or to
hear of a lauding from the Miffiflippi in the
state of TennefTee, would it not be desirable
that the President should have the power to
take advantage of voluntary enlistments, and
to raise an army of Â»0,000 men ? He believed
it would. The expence will not be gone into
except it be necefTary, and he saw no danger
that could arise from placing this power in
the hands of the President. For though miH
tia-men might be de.pended upon to repel any
iudden attack, their continuance in the field
could not be relied upon. If the militia was
whcSlly under the authority of the U. States
and under the command of officers appointed
by them, they might be more relied upon ;
b it as they are under the authority of the se
veral dates, and commanded by officers in
fonie cases appointed by the states, and in o
thers by themselves, and in many parts with
out arms, he did not think the* ought entire
ly to be relied upon. Or will gentlemen fa.y,
that the people in the southern states, in cafe
of attack, are to rely upon the militia of the
eastern states to march for their relief ? Sure
ly it would be much better to enlist men from
amongst: themselves, where danger threatens
the molt,to form.anarmy to repel any such at
tack.
Mr. S. said, if this army was proposed to be
raised immediately, it would be objefted a
gainst it, that no one could fay it would cer
tainly be wanted ; and now it is proposed to
be raised, in cafe there (hould appear a necefii
ty for it, it is called an extraordinary measure.
Thus, it was true, gentlemen would prevent
effett.ual means of defencÂ£ being gone into;
but, as he eonceived, though there is now no
immediate occasion for these troops, there
might be in the recess of Congress, he wishâ
ed to give the President the power to raise
them, if he should fee occasion.
Mr. Harper believed, notwithstanding
what had been advanced by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin) that this
was a very unprecedented measure ; because
however prepared the House may be, on some
occasions, at the firft bllifh of a business, to
decide upon theabftratt principle, yet it was
perfeftly novel in their proceedings to rejeÂ£t
a bill on its firft reading, .which contains such
a variety ot proportions, and which are capa
ble of such a variety of modifications, as the
present. Itwasalfoas little consonant with
the present situation of the country as it was
with their ul'ual modes of proceeding. The
allusion to the dccifiouon the bill for repealing
the (lamp aft (as hadbeenfhiwn) was noway
applicable. He could fee no Other vie* wÂ» a
proportion of this kind bur a determination to
refill every measure tor the defence of the
country. If the intention had not been to de
ftioy the bill, it would have been flittered to
have taken its usual course, and attempts
would have been made to amend it. It a pro
visional army was not liked, gentlemen might
have had the army immediately railed; or, it
10,000 men were too many, fewer miglit have
beea proposed. If gentlemen did not think
the army immediately neceflary, and did not
cluife to leave it -with the Prelident to judge,
of that necessity, they might make it to de
pend upon a declaration of war by France, on
an invÂ»f,on, or in caie Viftor Hughes were to
1 brine his Black troops, or fern* his threatened
frigates against uJ, or if an infurreftion thould
be excited by our enemy, then the President
should be empowered to'raife an army.
But gentlemen (ay this bill ought to bt re
jetted, because it is uneonftitutional. Could
gentlemen be serious in makingthisobjetlioii f
Were troops ever raised in a different
And if they tiad the power to authorize the
President to raise troops immediately,-they
foiild certainly do it under such contingencies
as they thought proper. Did not Congress
entrust the President with the dilcretionary
power of borrowing money, of in some cales
fixing salaries, &c. which powers were equal
ly veiled in them with the powerof raising ar
mies j and this mull be the cafe, except gen
tlemen in/ifl that Congress should itielf do all
the afls committed to it; and if so, they mult
always be in tefiion.
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania fays,
that if this power be delegated to the Presi
dent, Congress may as well entrufl the Preli
dent with the power of raiting provisional
taxes. He had no hesitation in faying, that
he believed this might be done ; that the
house might determine upon a tax, and au
thorize the collecting of it, only in cafe the
President thould find it neceffiiry, or in cafe
a certain event thould;take pl*ce.
With refpeft, then, to the expediency of
the measure. He did not speak of the expe
diency of raiting 20,000 men, because any
other number might be determined upon, but
as to the thing itfelf. What is the internal
and external flateof this country ? Do we not
know that the enemy has in view a plan upon
which they place great reliance, of gaining
over to their cause a certain class of men who
abound in the southern parts of this country,
and by whose means they intsnd to subju
gate or d,e(lrey the country ? We do know
this; gentlemen from the southern states
know it; yet they fay it is impoflible to raise
any regular force to repel the enemy. He
could not believe, that when we had to meet
an enetpy, who has always fought by
of domeftif infurreilion, who is now lubvert
ing the motl ancient governments irt the
world by these means, it would be confident
with any maxim of common sense, to be un
prepared for the worst.
Gentlemen rely upon the militia ; but do
they not he the difficulty there is attending
the adoption of any regular plan for training
the militia. That great opposition. is given
to the bill for. newly .organizing that force,.,
and that, according to the present organiza
tion, it would be a work of time and difficulty
to draw an effectual force to the quarter where
an attack might be made, betides that there
is a great want of arms in the militia. 'He
would not speak of the other enemy which we
had withi*4Â«rÂ£wn hnforn, and Upon which,
nelttppoftd, the French great-relied, be
cause he did not. believe that enemy exittea
.to any extent. As to the Intentions of some
gentknieA, he was not bound to pronounce
his opinion upon them ; he was not obliged
to fay that he believed that there are indivi
duals in this country who would be glad to
fee a French force in it ; or that there are
those who carry on a correspondence with a
foreign country, or that the ineafures pursued
abroad inimical to the interests of this coun
try, are not concerted at home. He would
not fay that he had such a belief ; but he
would not fay he had not. As to there be
ing any number of tljis description of persons,
who could be relied hpon by a foreign nation,
he repelled the idea with disdain. He knew
the American people, and he knew them bet
ter than to believe any such thing. He knew
that they loved their country ; that they
would sometimes dispute onpolitical fubjeils,
but when the finger of violence.was pointed
at them, they would feel the family spirit and
repel all attacks with one heart. As to the
few persons which tHere might be of a con
trary spirit, he did net believe any provision
was neceflary as to them ; he believed thf
courts of justice Would take care of thele per
sons. ' Whiltt they remain behind their bat
teries, they do little harm ; and, if they come
forward, the. remedy would be found in the
exifling laws. But the other foe, formidable
by its numbers, in a part of the cofintry
where the population is thin; in a climate
favourable to the health of these people, and
unfavourable to the health of perions of a
different description ; formidable, because of
the contingency to the quarter from whence,
an attack may be exported, he wilhed for an
etieÂ£lual force to tlrike that foe, whenever or
whereve/ it may shew its head.
What, said he, is our external situation I
Do we not-fee the nation with whom we are
at vaiiance, find quarrels with every country
who is not tlrong enough to retift her ?" Does
fee not injure 11s on every fide! Do we not near
of her depredatory threats, and the mifchiefs
the has the powerof doing 11s, urged as rea
sons why we thouldfubmit to her ? And yet,
after being told of these designs, shall we fit
with our arms folded, and make no defence I
For the measures already taken, will be no
thing without this. Fortifications would be
nothing, except supported by a fufficient
number of infantry and cavalry.
What, he alked, is the situation of the-Weft
Indies > Were they not told that Viftor
Hughes, with 5,000 of his bell troops, is ready
to make a blow upon the southern country,
whenever the word of command shall be giv
en i They knew that these troops existed ;
they had been seen, and the desperate charac
ter of their leader was alio krtown. Yet,
with this enemy upon our threshold, within
four or five days fail of 11s, we flill fold our
arms, and fay we will make no defence.
When he refleflrd upon these things, he
could not help deploring that fatal blindness,
that stubborn spirit of pppofition in certain
gentlemen, which could hide from their view
the dangers of oiirprefent iituation ; that, at
a period when the veil is rending from before
the eyes of the community ; when those who
have been the motl blind out of doors begin
to fee, that those gentlemen in this house
who from their ancient birth and fortunes'
might be ftippofed to pofiefj the true Ame
rican spirit, thould ttill perfitl in their blind
their deflrutf ive course, was greatly to be la
mented. And though he could not doubt
the fate of this bill, yet that there thould U
a tew men found supporting measures which
tend directly to the definition of the coun
try, he could not help lamenting.

GENTLEMEN,
Your address and memorial to the Presi

tatives of the Unired States, has been pre
sented to me, by one of your representa
tives in congress, Mr. Sitgreaves.
The sentiments and determinations, ex
prefled in this address, are iu h as become
the sincere lovers of their country, in dan-I
geious times: in proportion to yotir fatis
fa&ion, with the endeavors of your own
government, mud be your alarm and re
lentment, at the wrongs, menaces and ig
dignities which have been so profufely and
so undeservedly committed against it.
Those who have found divisions among
the people, in so many republican nations,
so favorable to their views of ambition, a.
varice and conquest, might naturally build
their hopes of success in this country on
similar foundations, but they will find them
selves disappointed.
Threats to extinguilh the independence
of the United States, or. to partition or,
dismember them in the twenty-third year of
their age, could never be made, but by
persons as profoundly ignorant of the pow
er of the state, as grefsly mifinformed of
the spirit and resources of the people.
Nothing in the course of my life has gi
ven me a more exquisite pleasure than the
frank acknowledgments, from various quar
ters, and in your address in particular, of
a sense of the bjfcfixngs you enjoy, as mem
bers of this happy and highly favored com
munity, under the truly free and equal go
vernment of the United States from which
these blessings proceed ; your freedom and
independence deserve to be maintained at
every hazard.
While the decided declaration of your
perse& and grateful approbation of the con
duit heretofore pursued by the executive
authority cf government, is an high re
ward and an ample falisfa&ion to me, Your
honorable engagement to support etery
measure, which may be thought neceflary
to secure the constitution, freedom and in
dependence of the United States, ipuft

CENTUM F.V,
Your virtuous refohitfons at Harford
town, unanimously adoptedon the 28th day

Matthews?
The fatisfa&ion you manifeft, iirthe mea
sures taken far an accommodation of differ
ences subsisting between this country and
the French Republic is very agreeable to me.
The determination to support in all Gtu
ations your independence'and the govern
ment of yonr choice is worthy of freemen
and faithful citizens, and the public decla
ration of such sentiments at this time, in or
der to fliew the unanimity of the people is
good paJicy, as it tends to confirm the con
fidence of the whole nation in one another
and to increase its refpedlability and consi
deration with foVeign nations.
JOHN ADAMS-
Philadelphia, May 3d, 1798.
For the Gasettk of the United States.
How gratifying must it be to the Amer
can mind to observe the noble lardor and
spirit that is pervading all ranks and de
scriptions of people, and how highly con
ducive must be its effefts to give the lie to
the b?.fe imputations lately call upon our
national charadlerâand under which if we
had remained supine and silent, and not
gloriously evinced the contrary by assem
bling together and freely giving our senti
ments, opinions ind determinations, other
nations might warrantablyhaVf-giVeira de
gree of credit to the a fie rt ion of that apos
tate Perigord, that ws were a divided
pie, and that France by the agency of a
party that (he had in this country, could so
impede the operation of government that
we (hould be obliged to set quietly down
under mere harmless expreflions of resent
ment. That (he had some reason to calcu
-1 ate so, I am afraid circumstances force us
to acknowledge ; and that we have some
chara&ers amongst us that would wish it to
be the cafe, and have labored to impose up
on- her the belief that they could effed their
views mud be conceded : but thank God,
they willfully deceived themselves aud gross'
ly deceived their dear alliesâfor however
upon particular topics or measures there
may be a diversity of opinion, wh# now
dare assert, that when our national honor*
and independence are wounded and
that we will not all with one voice and one v
accord nobly step forward in their defence,and
rifle ourlives andfortunes to maintain them i
Yes, the world will, and must bejieve it,
after the free and unbiafled expreflions o(
the general willâ pouring in from all quar
ters of the United States, Publifiiers of
news-papars, you are in duty bound to cir
culate the addresses through the world, and â¢
let the diredtory themselves fee how they
have over-rated the influenced their par
ty, and foolifhly misled themselves.
That there -was a cor.fider'able national
bias in their favor they have had reason to
believe, and as far as foreign attachment
can be juftified, it was a laudable aud hon
orable one in this country : but to have *
counted upon its operating to such an ex
test, as to-liave blinded us against our own
interest and tronsr, and to secure our (Ã¼b
miflion to injury and iufult, mud have pro
ceeded 'from the wicked tnifreprefentations
of some vipers in our bofqm who depended
upon French agency to overturn our
government. But their machinations have,
and will prove abortiveâfor with such an
American-like spirit as is now kindlltig from
<sne end of the country to the other, I de
fy their p'ots even with the aid of an array
of thof? treipendous heroes that have borne
down before them the combined troops of
Europe 5 for their wonderful efficiency and
success has arisen in a great degree from the
ardorand'enthufiafm tSat a&uated them,
and the- divisions of those they attacked.
In this country they vrould have to encoun
ter the fame ardor and enthusiasm, height
ened by the convi&ion of the glory and
justice of our cause. Yes, they would have
to eontend with the A merit an Youthâthe
fame who are voluntarily coming forward
and pledging themselves to their country
and the world to be ready at the firft call to
defend their rights, liberty and indepen
dence. With fuSh they would fir.d it more
difficult to contend than with the hireling!
of monarchs, for even led on by Buonaparte
himfelf, th#y would run no small ri(k of be.
ing Burguoyned or CornwallisedâThe
least retribution the fame party could make
to Fran re for iheir BUfreprcientations,
would be to give the directory some whole
some warnings against attempting an invar
fion of this country ; for thole fame men '
(coming with this design)' that were once
received with plaudits and acclamations,
would now be greeted with a bear's hug a
hug of deathâl feel elated that it is the
youth of my native city'th'at have set the
glorias example of publishing to the wortd
theii fixed determinatipn to fupyort their '
government and offering their personal fer,
vice for its defence ; and as I am convinced
the fame fpiiit exists in the youth through
out the Union, I hope they will unsni
mdufly adopt the fame method of making
it known; and not be detered by the '-
base attempts at ridiculing the aflociation
that has and will appear from presses of a
certain cast ; but rather deem it a good
criterion to judge that it will be regarded
as highly honorable by the worthy and vir
tuous class of our fellow citizens. I have n<j
doubt it will prove acceptable and gratify
ing to our worthy chief magiltrate,
raise ycur,name high in the estimation of
the world, and be productive of the efftft
expressed in the compreheiifive chortlj of
Hopkinfon's muehadmiredfong,aiidthat by
so doing-â" Peace and fafety we (hall find."

In the metre of " Chevy Chafe."
THE Patriots of Abington
For fear of future harm,
Have met to pray, that Congress may
Not let our merchants " arm."
Lieutenants two, and s Squires two,
And Mejfrs three unite
With Deacon one, and Doflor one,
To draught the prayer aright.'
This sage committee thus cortipos'd
Of men whose knowledge great,
Extends o'er politics profound
Of Parilh, Town and State.
Church, state, militia-officers,
One man of faience eke 1
When their production cometh out,
What wonders will it speak ?
Yet strange to tellâfurpafling strange !
The politicians seem,
Of differing'politicians' plans,
T'bave chose the vilest scheme.
What ! mull our vessels lay and rot 1
While foreigivfaUors come
In foreign (hips of ev'ry flag
To waft our produce
Our merchants beggar'd ! sailors flarv'd 1
Their wives and ehildren too ?
Or (hall they go 10 Abington,
To work, good men, for you ?
Perhaps you think so many men
At once thrown from employ,
Will bring the price of labor down,
And you'll the gain enjoy.
Say generoÂ»s Committee, fay,
What wages will you give I
For tho' I may not go to sea
Yet I atid mine must live.
My way I cannot yet fee clear
Into the woods to go ;
First run in debt to buy a farm,
And then to Ving it to.
Fell trees, pile logs, then burn 'em up,
Work all day long in smoke,
Then to my wife come weary home
All cover'd o'er crock.
The interest like a ftnker cuts,
While the young orchard grow*.
Is this to cause the " <ivildcrnefs
ToblofTom like the role ?"
Asd when th' accumulated debt
Which has become so large,
Mad be paid offâmy farm and flock,
Will scarce the whole discharge.
This will not doâ-indeed 'twill not,
Good men of Abington,
You mull contrive some other coat
F.re sailors " try it on."
Have you not read ?âno doubt you hare,
Of China in the east ?
How they forever flay at home,
Nor travel further weft ?
They cultivate their fruitful fields,
And fell their produce there,
Make foreign nations court their trade
And we obtain a (hare.
But are tb*y happier. Sirs, than we ?
Survey their lab'rng poor!
Their Infants drotvn'd their ParentsJJarv'd
' On the polluted (bore 1
Drop 1 drop the curtain, change the scene !
Let uÂ« come home again
To our own blefl America
Where we may. live like men.
If Congress bids us fight, I'll fight,
Tho' war I denrerate,
For to obey, I hoid its right;
The rulers of the State.
Let Abington Committees ehpofe
And trnmpet every ipme,
Lieutenants, DcSors, Deacons, 'Squires,
To problematic fame :
My business I will mind at home,
If I mayn't go to fra,

Both Abington and me.
