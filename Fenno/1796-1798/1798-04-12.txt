THE S T A NDâNo. 111.
In reviewing the disgusting fpeftacle of
the French revolution, it is difficult to avert
the eye entirely from those features of it
whii h betrav a plan to difbrganize the hu
man.mind itfelf, as well as to undermine the
venerable pillars that support the edifice of
civilized society. The attempt by the rulers
of a nation to destroy all religious opinion,
ami to prevert a whole nation to Atheism,,
is a phenomenon of profligacy reserved to
consummate the infamy of the unprincipled
reformers of FranceâThe proofs of this ter
rible design are numerous and convincing.
The animosity to the Christian fyftcm is
derronftrated by the single faft of the ridicu
-1 us and impolitic eftablilhment of the de
cades, with the evident objeft of supplant
ing the Christian Sabbath. The inferiptions
by public authority on the tombs of the de
ceased, affirming death to be an eternal deep,
witness the desire tÂ» discredit the belief of
the immortality of the foul. The open pro
feffion of Atheism in the Convention,* re
ceived with acclamations ; the honorable
mention on its journals of a book profeffing
to prove the nothingness of all religion ;f
the institution of a fettival to offer public
worftiip to a courtezan decorated with the
pompoHs title of" Goddess of Reason
the congratulatory reception of impious chil
dren appearing in the hall of the Conventi
on to lisp blasphemy against the King of
Â» are among the dreadful proofs-of a
conspiracy to establish Atheism on the ruins
of Christianityâto deprive mankind of its
best consolations and moftatiimating hopesâ
and to make a gloomy dtsfert of the uni
verfc. |
Latttrrly the indications of this plan are j
not so frtquent as they were, but from time j
to time fomethin;; still escapes which disco
vers that it is not renounced. The late ad
dress of Buonaparte to the Direftory is an
example. That unequalled conqueror, from
whom it is painful to dttraft, itl whom one
would wish to find virtues worthy of hi#
filming talents, prophanely unitesÃELictON
(not superstition) with Royalty, and the
feudal fyllem as the scourges of Europe for
centilries past. The decades likewise remain
the catapulta which is to butter down
Christianity.
Eqiul pains have been taken to deprave
the morals as to extinguif.) the religion of
tlie countty, if indeed nlorality-in a com
munity can be frparated from religion. It
is among the lingular and fantaftic vagaries
of the French revolution, that white the
Duke of Brunfwick was marching to Paris,
a ntiv divorce was patted ; which
makes it as easy for a husband to get rid of
his v ife, and a wife of lier husband, as to
discard a worn out habit.J To complete
the diffolutiori of those ties, which are the
chief links of domeftie and ultimately of
social attachment, the Journals of the Con
vention record with guilty applause the ac
cusations preferred by children againfl their
parents.
It is notneceffary to lig'ghten thepifture
by sketching the horrid groupeof prescrip
tions and murders which have made Francs
a den of pillege and (laughter ; blackening
with eternal opprobnum the very name of
man.
1 he pious and the moral weep over these
fee ucs as a sepulchre destined to entomb all
Â»hey revere and esteem. The politician,
who loves liberty, fees them with regret as
a gulph that may swallow up the liberty to
yhicb be is devoted. He knows that mo
lality overthrown (andmorality muflfM with
religion) the terrors of despotism can alone
curb the impetuous passions of man, and
confine him within the bounds of social du
ty-
But let us return to the condnft of revo
lutionary France towards other nations, as
more immediately within our purpose.
It has been seen that (lie commenced her
career as the champion of universal liberty ;
and, proclaiming deftruftion to the govern
ments which (he was pleafcd to denominate
defpoti , made a tender of fraternity and
affittance to the nations whom they oppress
ed. She, at the fame time, dife'aimed
conquett and aggrandizement.
But it has since clearly appeared, that at
the very moment (he was making these pro

kflkms, and while her diplomatic agent'
were hypocritically amuling foreign courts*
with conciliatory explanations and promises
of moderation, (he was exerting every facul
ty, by force and frand, to accomplish the
very conquest and aggrandizement which (he
infiduoufly disavowed.
1 he people of Belgium, ensnared by fair
pretences, believed that in abandoning the
defence of their country and Trie cmife of
their ancient sovereign, they acquired a title
to enjoy liberty under a government of their
own choice, prote&;d by France. Con
trary, to the hopes which were infpired-,
contrary to the known will of a large
rity of that peopleâcontrary to all their re
ligious and national prejudicesâthey have
been compelled to become departments of
France. And their violated temples have
afforded a rich plunder to aliment further
conquest and opprefiion.
The I)ufch, seduced by the fame arts to
facilitate rather than obftruit the entrance
of a French af-tty into their cour.try.thought
they were only getting rid of their (ladt
holder and nobles, and wt-ie to retain their
terrftory, and their wealth ft cured by fnch
a civil establishment as they (hoirld freely
choofe-. Their reward is the dismember
ment of their country and the loss of their
wealth by exhaullmg contributions ; and
they are obliged to takÂ« a government, dic
tated by a faction openly countenanced, and
fnpported by France.- Completely a pro
vince cf France in imitation of their frantic
matters, they are advancing with rapid
ffrides to a iawlefe tyranny at home.-j-
France profefiing eterfial hatred to kings
was to be the tutelary genius of republicsâ
Holland, Genoa, Venice, the Swiss
Cantons and the United States, are
agonizing witnesses of her sincerity.
Of undone Holland no more need be said
ânothing remains for us but to exercise
tender sympathy in the unfortunate fate of
a country which generously lent its aid to
eftabh'fli our independence, and to deduce
from her melancholy example an instruc
tive lesson to repel with determined vigor,
the mortal embrace of her seducer and de
stroyer.
Genoa, a speck on the globe, for having
at every hazard refilled the efforts of the
enemies of France to force her from a neu
tral station, is recompensed with the sub
version of her government, and i*e pillag6
of her wealth by compulsory and burthen
fome contributions. I
Venice is no more {-'ln vain had (lie pre
ftfrved a faithful neutrality, when perhaps
her interpolation might have inclined the
scale of viftory in Italy against France. A
few of her citizens kill | some French sol
diers. Inflant retaliation takes place. Ev
ery attonement is offeredâNothing will fuf
nce but the overthrow of her government.
'Tis effefled. Her own citizens attrafted
by the lure of democracy become accessary
to it, and receive a popular government at
the hand of France. What is the sequel
âwhat the faith ke t with them. It suit*Â»
France to bride (he Emperor to a surrender
of the Netherlands and to peace, that (ke
may pursue her projefts elfewhcre with lefa
oUtacle. It suits France to extend her
power and commerce by the acquisition of
portions of the Venetian territories. The
bribe is offered and accepted. Venice is
divided. She disappears from the map of
nations. The tragedy of Poland is reap
ed with circumstances of aggravated atro
city. France is perfidious enough to facri
fice a people, who at l>erdefire had consent
ed to abrogate their privileged cajls, to the
chief of thole despots, againit whom (lie
had vowed eternal hatred.
The Swiss cantonsâthe boafl: of repub
licansâ the model to which they have been
glad to appeal in proof, that a. republican
government may eonfift with the ordsr and
happiness of societyâthe old and faithful
allies of France, who are not even pretend
ed to have deviated from finctre neutrality
âwhat are they at this moment ? Perhaps
like Veniceâajlory told!â The despots of
France had found pretences to quarrel with
themâcommotions were excitetf the le
gions of France were in march to second
tne insurgents. Utile other hope remains
than that the death of this refpe<slahle peo
ple wiil be as glorious as their life ; that
they will fell their independence as dearly as
they bought it. But why despair of a
brave and virtues people who appear de
termined to meet the impending danger
with a countenance emulous of their ancient
renown ?
The United Statesâwhat is their filia
tion ? Their sovereignty trampled in the
dust and their commerce bleeding at every
pore, speak in loud accents the spirit of op
pression and rapine, which charatterifes the
ufurperg of France. But of this a diilinft
view isrequifite and will be taken.
In these transactions we difeover ambition
and fanaticifm marching hand in handâ
bearing the ei.figns of liypocrify, treache
ry and rapine. The dogmas of a falfeand
fatal creed second the weapons of ambition.
Like the prophet of Mecca, the tyrants of
France press forward with the aleoran of
their faith in one hand, and the sword in
the otherâThey proselyte, subjugate and
debaseâno dillinftion is made between re
public and monarchyâall mull alike yield
to the aggrandizement of the " great na

TITUS MANLIUS.
From the Columbian Cent'incl.
To the Writer of the piece signed A Re
publican, in Monday's Chronicle..
S,R Â» . . â¢
AS I had no other objeft in remarking
on the piece fignedhy you in a former Chr
onicle, th in to deleft your falfe (latements
and expose them to the pablie, foit was to
tally indifTeient to me whether my observa
tions met your no ice or t- at < f any other
of the Clir iiicle paragraphifts.âMuch less
did it Concern me whether your noticing
them, arose from the recommendatory pa
ragraph of the Editor, or the weight of the
observations themselves. For merely felling
the truth I did not wish a compliment nor
had I any reason to dread censure. I (hould
not now pay pay any attention to you* se
cond piece, did I not find the fame aflerti
ons advanced without evidence, and the
fame attempt at deception, with only a little
variation in the mode. Contidered in the
lijjht of an answer to my observations, evrey
one will perceive there ii nothi g in it that
dtfervesthe name. If any one (hould read
your piece an<i not mine, he would conclude
mine to have been a treatise on the advanta
ges cf the trade with Great-Britain, and
an effort to (how that the balance was in
our favour. âYour'ti being only a humble at- J
tempt to disprove such a d<s& ine. This '
evasion, Sir, shall not answer your purpose.
I will ptrfevere in expefing you, and will (
{how your fellow-citizens, that with all your '
hypocritical cant you are ignorant of their
true inteteds, and by base insinuations are
<1 riving to alienate their affetljons from that
government which ifliey are to pro
test, and which in return is to them pro.
duitive of the greatest blefiings. As you
still pcrfift in boldly asserting " that the
security of Britifli manufadlures is the sole
objefl now contemplated by arming." â¢ I
mull 1 e more explicit with yon, and I af
firm that vour position is wholly untrue.â
Yon well know that it is not solely in conse
quence 1 Â« the late French decree (of which
you perlilt in lcavingout the most important
to wit, the coofifcalion of the (hip
for being only the carrier of an article of
Britilh produce or merchandize, that arm
ing is e nteniplated. You W/ know, Sir,
and if you had any other intention than to
dece ve, you wonld admit, that the business
of aiming was taken up in Congrcfs, before
the decree referred to, had reached Ameri
ca, an<J that the conlideratian of the fubjefl
was poftpoticd only until official advices
could be obtained from our envoys at Paris.
You know that many considerations much
more important than that decree, some of
which I mentioned ai?4 which you could
not deny, for I am sure you would had you
been able, loudly call upon us to aim, not
for the purpose which you and other ftch
Repulliians pre'end, to make war on France
no Sir, but in defence of those rights
which the law of nations secures to ns; and
which France hcrfelf in the 27th, article of
her treaty wi h u> has acknowledged and
confirmed. Why then do y< u attempt to
call into aftion any latent prejudices wHich
may remain against the British, and by fatfe
ly pretendi' g hat our government is hos
tile to Franc , ltrive to beget a diftrtift fa
tal to that unanimity which at this crisis i 3
indispensable to our existence. - What good
motive can afluate you or your friends,
when you carefully keep ont of view the ag
gieflions which Fiance if daily heaping on
us, and gravely tell people that our govern
ment arc deceiving them ; that the French
arc treating ns only as we defcrve ; and that
they will presently be called on to pay e
normous taxes " to defend a trunk of ib
bons, a box of hats, or a cafe of Ihoes."
Can you doubt, fir, hat when the people
fee thrfe attempts to roiflead them, they
can withhold their indignation from the
authors ?
You lay tint " English produce and English
manafadlurcs Â»re the only articles fpe< ified as
liable to capture by the French." This is not
true, 'mlet. you maintain that American fhipi
and their appurtenances are English produce
and manufactures ; for they also by the dtcree
are declared j-oi d and lawful prize. There is
therefore jn abfordity in your asking the quef.
tion, " is it for the intercft of the United States
to make war againd ' ranee for the ohlainment
of these articles It U a queflinn which no
one but youffelf wrÂ«id ask, and you are welcome
to the exclusive right of giving the answer.
Yctir diiTeitation on the difartvantages of the
Dtitilh trade is 'otally foreign from the business
of arming.it has nothing to do with that quef
tion. ' 1 lannot help obfetving, however, on
the variance between yon and ot'ers of your
fraternity, from the doflrine laid down bythe
pbilo/opber JfffcrJon, that arch pontiff of the
â¢rights of man âhe declares that we are not ma
tured to become a manufafluiing country âthat
until we hive a redundancy rf labourers, the
ctiltivitit g the foil is our proper employment,
and thnt while the prtre of labour is so high,
we can better afford to import than to manu
faflure. Truly you are unworthy difciplei of
so goi d a maftcr to preach tie c ntrary dofl
rinr. Another paragraph is worthy of notice,
it is thisâ â¢* The French hive seen proper to
prevent the further arrival of British produce or
manufactures into this and if we fluJied
onr real interest.we should applaud the measure
rather than incur the expences of a war to
counteract it." This language is preoifely that
employed !>r Mr. Monroe, and therefore was
to he expected from those who defend him-
I!e told the directory " That if in their opin
,.n it produced any lelid good to tb< republic
todifregard the 13d and 14th articles of the
treaty, the American government and bis coun
trymen would not only bear with the departure
with patience bill with pkafufe." The lan
guage of your argument is this, whereas the
people of Ameriit have been, ever since the
lirll settlement of the c iuntry, in the habit of
carrying on a molt pernicious and ruinous trade
with the kingdom of Great-Britain and its de
pendencies without discovering its pernicious
tendency âand whereas it is abundanily mani
feft that this fatal fyftein carrying in its train
poverty with all its attendant illÂ», has ot late
years increased to a rnnft ahrming degree,
may tie seen bv the impoverished condition ot
our citizens and the decayed and ruinous (late of
all our ioÂ« ns which have had any concern there
inâand whereas this trade if not tpeedily (top
ped mud end in the diflru<stion of our country.
We therefore the exclisfive patriots and republi
cans of America, do most heartily rejoice that
our generous allies the French, whole sagacity
has led them to discover the. mifchiefs of wh ch
our citizens were ignorant, and to which we
are fubjeft from this source, and who a<ft from
no other motive than a disinterested regard to
u >, have at length determined to interfere in our
behalf by 11 preventing the further arrival of
Britifb produce or manufactures into tins coun
try, and we furthermore render them our hear
ty thanks that lor the more r-ffafiual prevention
of this traffick, they ire fÂ« obliging as t,o appro
priate such pioperty to their own life and t >
make prizes of the (hips and appurtenances em
ployed therein, and kindly to can y our mari
ners into captivity, by which we are rcliev.-d
from the noily clamours of a chfs of men, who
are so stupid as not to fee the jultice or pjl.cy
of a measure, which drips them of their earn
ings and throws them on the companion of
(Grangers for subsistence." You alk me what
was my language when the British were taking
our vefTelsâthe fame it is now, and hid the
court of Great-Britain treated the envoy who
was ihen sent, wiih the fame contemptuous a
hufe, which the directory have heaped on Mr.
Pinckney and his colleaguesâthere can be 1 ttle
doubt that the voice of indignation would have
been heard from one end of the continent t> the
other. Inflead of a party like ti.at which we
now find juftifyin? every aggrefiion of the
French the vote for arming, would have been
unanimous. Yau fay the British have in their
hands 5,000,000 of pirated property ; the asser
tion is not true âif it were, how many millions
I of pirated property have the French in their
I hands ? and 1 venture'to jflert that more money
i has already betn paid to our citizens by the
Britilh for illegal captures than ever <tw7/bepaid
by the French, although the amount in their
, hands is much the greatest. Yes Sir, Ido call
1 the terms British manufactures and yeÂ»ii amy
from your unceasing repetition of them, ajin
-1 gle which you and your party have bee* cou
) ftantly ringing in our ears fur years pad, and
thetocfin with which yon threaten us, would
ibe far more peasant âit would at least afford
I some variety.
You repeat that preGdent Adams and his son
1 have received 80,000 dollars within two years
of the public money, which you fay I do not de
ny. I supposed the faifhood too glaring to need
a denial Left you should triumph in your
fuppafed faccefs. I now tell you that your aflfer
| tion is falfe, and the intinuation with which it is
accompanied, infamous. That they have re
ceived each of them the'compenfatious allowed
1 them by law for their important fervicej I pte
fume : To fiy that either of them have receiv
ed more than that, with the insinuation that
they have improperly received it, is an afTertion
so frandalotis, that nothing but a habit ofcalum
-1 riating eve y thi.g that is virtuous could have
! induced you to advance.
You finifh your observations, with borrowing
my concluding paragraph âI allure you, Sir, I
am willing to abide that test ; the people will rea
dily diftingni(h characters j they have long dif
j covered a system of undeviating warfare, carri
i ed on by y.,u and your party, against the gov
: ernment and its administration, whoever might
beat the head. The venerabli Washington,
whom they all love, has not escaped your ca
lumpies. The- p;op!e, Sir, have long known,
; that no measure of the administration has escap
ed oppMition and abnfeâknowing as they do,
that the affections of the people conflitnte the
firmed basis of a republican government; they
have beheld with just indignation your.constant
attempts to rob them of that fnpport, by attri
buting the most corrupt motives to those in
whose abilities and integrity they have chosen
' to confide. No man ever came into ofljee at
acrifismore important anil difficult, than the
1 President of the United States, or with purer
1 views. To refill the inroads of foreign lnflu
ence, and quiet the clamours of dsmedic faction,
was an arduous talk, in which he de erved the
aid of every true American. But what has been
the fail âThe people have seen you and your
party continually reviling this virtuous nun,
and every measure of his admi.iiftration âbo
! means have been thought too base to destroy
their confidence in his probity and good inten
tions; the lowed ridicule has been resorted to
, with a view to leflen him in the esteem of his
fellow citizens ; no allowance has been made
for the difficult situations in which he has been
called to afl ; he has been called a tory, a roy
alist, the dupe of Britilh induence âihfin'iations
, have been made that his sole' aim is to secure
honor and profit to himfelf and family, and he
1 has been invariably hunted and pursued, is if
! he was the avowed enemy of his country, and
by those too who kniiu that his whole life has
been condantly employed in promoting thehap
pinefs of his fellow-citizens, and of mankind.â
1 The wretches who have traduced him, stand
!in awe of his virtues. You, as an individual,
j may find some support in the patronage which
\ condut9 like yours may receive, from yourbre
j thren at the southward ; but as a citizeu of Maf
-1 fachufetts, this support will not avail you ; the
1 people of this Commonwealth, who unanimouf
iy voted for Mr. Adams as President, and whom
you dnte not call royalists and tones, kr.o v how
to despise yon ; in the hour of danger they will
d ag you from your skulking place, and cxpefe
you to the fsorn and contempt of your fellow
citizens. MARCUS.

CON G R ESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, April 9.
(Concluded frim yjltftlay i Gaxctte.)
Mr. Sewall then moved that the com
mittee go into the consideration of a resoluti
on reported on the Bth of March," for appro
priating a sum of money for fortifying the
ports and harbours of the United States.
It was accordingly read
Mr. Macon wished to know to what ex
tent it was wi(he3 to carry these fortifica
tions ?
Mr. Sewall thought it bed to leave this
business, in some measure, to thedifcretion of
the Prelident of the United States, and for
this purpose, he proposed to amend the re.so
lution, by adding the following words, " and
that the P'eJiJcni if the United States be autho
rized to make such additional ar.d other fortifica
tion!, as the common defence may seem to re
quire."
Mr. Macon was apprehenlive that all the
money expended on this objeit would be
thrown auay. It had heretofore been fuc
cefsfiilly (hewn that the mod expenlive works
of this kind iri the United States were wholly
useless, from the r improper fituauon. Be
lides, he d.id not think fortifications were
found of much use in the late war ; he knew
only of two iyftances in which effectual reiif
tance was made by them. It would be seen
that in Europe fortifications were now less
attended to than they had heretofore been.
Indeed, he believed, if the United States
were to go into an extefiiive scale of fortifi
cation, the revenues of the country would
not be equal to.it, and he thought money
might be much moieadvantageoully expend
ed.
Mr. S. Smith allowed some of the forti
fications of the Union might have been impro
perly placed; but could not agree with the
gentleman from North-Carolina as to their in
utility. At the lalt felfion, Mr. S. said, there
remained an unexpended balance of 22,000
dollars for this object, and Congress then ap
propriated 1 i5,ooodollarÂ» more. But a finall
part of this money, lie observed, had been ex
pended. The reason which tlie Secretary of
War gives for this is, that he did not think it
proper to expend more, because we had not
men to fill the fortifications when they (hould 1
be ready to receive them. He wished the Se
cretary of war had not cxerctfed this opinion,
but had laid out the money as directed. The
feled committee, he said, had taken into view
the several places to which it would be
proper to attend, which he supposed would
be enumerated when a bill was brought in.â
The sum which it was supposed would be
wanted in addition tof the money already in
hand, was estimated at 115,000 dollars. The
amendment was intended to empower the Pre
sident to ereÂ£t a post at the Chefapealc, which
he believed, ftom the account given of the
situation by gentlemen from that quarter,
would be very proper.
The quefiion on the amendment was put
and carried.
Mr. Da-yton (the Speaker) approved of
the resolution ; but he hoped when the Se
lect Committee reported a bill, they would
be prepared to give some information as to
two points ; firft, as to the cetTion of jurif
diition of lhe places whereon forts are to be
erefted, to the United States ; and secondly,
as to the instances in which tho United States
have purchased the foil without the previpus
consent of the state to which it belonged.
He was by no means prepared, at present, to
consent to the laying out of any money on
fortifications, the prior cefiion of the jurisdic
tion of which had not been made to the Uni
ted States. He did not know but he might
eventually be obliged to wave this objection,
but he hoped this information would be giv
en".
Mr. J. Williams supposed it would be
proper to instruct the committee to the effect
which the gentleman" from New-Jersey had
dated, if he wished them to report in the way
he had mentioned. But he did not think this
was a time to enquire into this fubje't ; but
to fortify the coalt in those places where it is
mo# vulnerable, independent of any other
cenfiderjtion.
The resolution was put and carried, there
being 71 members in its favour.
Mr. Sewall said, it v:as proper that Con
gress should come to some determination with
respect to the fortifications in the port of N.
York, H3 thelegiflatureof that state is now (it
ting, and when they know the determination of
Congress, they can aÂ£t accordingly. He cal
led up, therefore, for consideration the report
of the committee for the protection of com
merce and the defence of the country, on the
memorial of the New-York Chamber of Com
merce.
The report having been read, the resolution
recommended was agreed to.
The committee rose and reported the reso
lution?, and being agreed to, a bill was direct
ed to be brought in accordingly.
On motion of Mr. Livincston, the
house went into a committee of the whole 011
the bill for the relief of sick and disabled sea
men, and after adopting some amendments,
the bill was agreed to, and ordered to be read
a third time to-morrow. This bill proposes
the payment of 20 cents a month by every fea
inan in the United States towards the I'upport
of hospitals for lick and disabled feainen.
Mr. D. Foster called up tordecifio 1 the
report of the committee of claims on a resolu
tion directing them to enqu.rc into the expe
diency of amending the laws respeCting inva
lid pensioners ; which was accordingly read
and concurred in. It was against any altera
tions in the exiftinglaws.
The Speaker laid before the house the
petition of James Greenleaf, of this city,
praying for an alteration in the laws respeCt
ing insolvent debtors. Referred to the com
mittee who had this subjeCt under considera
tion.
Mr 1 . Sewall, from the committee for the
protection of commerce and the defence of
the country, made a farther report as follow :
" That it is expedient to authorize the Pre
sident of the United States, to errect fortifi
cations in such ports and places near the fe.i
coÂ«ft, as in his judgment (hall be requilite and
â advantageous for the common defence.
" That a considerable addition is reqttifite
to be made to the corps of artillerists and en
gineers already efiablilhed, to be employed in .
the several fortifications which have been and
which shall be erected on or near the sea
coast.
" That a large supply of cannon, arms and
ammunition is necell'ary to be immediately
provided for the fervicc of the United States.
" An addition to a refoive heretofore re
ported, and under the conGderation of the
house, will eft'eCt the firft mentioned object.
" For the others, the committee recoip
mend the following resolutions :
" Resolved, that the Prefidentof the Unit
ed Srates be authorized to raise ahd eflablifh
companies of artillerists and engineers,
in addition to the present eftablifhtrent.
" Resolved, that the sum of dol
lars be appropriatnd by law for the pr.rchafe
of cannon, arms and ammunition, for the
service of the United States."
x This report was referred to the committee
of the whole on the state of the union.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
claims, made an unfavourable report on the
petitions of John Nelson and Sarah Ruffel,
which was Concurred in.
On motion of Mr. Litinoston the house
went into a committee of the whÂ»le on the re- |
port of the committee of commerce and manu
factures on the petition of Pierre Ampoix,
who prays for thfe allowance of certain draw
backs. The report is favourable j but as it
did not appear to have been printed, the com
mittee rose, in order to give time for the
printing of it.
On motion of the fame gentleman, the
house went into a committee of the whole on
a favourable report on the petitions of Reuben
Smith and Nathan Strong, which being agreed
to, the committee rose, and a bill was order
ed to be brought in accordingly.
A meflage was received from the Pre(i(lent
of the United States, informing the house,
that he had approval! and signed an act to con
tinue in force the aCt prohibiting for a limit
ed time, the exportation of arms and ammu
nition,- and for encouraging the importation
thfreof ; an act for the relief of refugees from
Canada and Nova Scotia ; and an act for fe

mously called to the chair. The objedt of
the meeting was, the voluntary contributi
ons which had beeu opened at the Bank un
der the authority of an aÂ£t of Parliament.
The Lord Mayor opened the business. by
observingâThe inveterate animosity
which the enemy had profeffed, and the
holt lie meafurcs which they openly avowed,
rendered it the duty of every man who had
the iu;ereil of his country at heart, to come
forward to arm it with the mean; of repel
ling every attempt, and demonstrates the
propriety of the objstl of the meeting so
clearly as to fupercede the necessity of a
comment." After several highly patriotic,
able, and animated fpeechts, the Lord
Mayor left the chair, when Mr. alderman
Watson proposed THREE CHEERS
for OLD ENGLAND, which was cor
dially, and with patriotic shouts imariimouf
ly agreed to, and rfie fame ftjr the KING,

This morning we received French papers
up to the 7th inft. the contents of which
we have detailed at considerable length.
One article in them deserves particular no
tice, viz. a motion made by Guillemardettin
the council of 500 for altering the mode of
drawing by lot for a fucceflor to the mem
ber of the executive direftory, who goes
out annually. The nomination of the
succeeding member, as the law now stands,
is veiled in the legislative body, which com
mences its fitting after the new third are
chosen ; but Guillemardet proposes -that it
(hall be veiled in future in the legislative
body before that third are changed.
It appears that the Cisalpine troops, who
were marching to Rome to avenge the in
lult offered to the French republic by the
death of Duphot, have met with*a small
check from some armed ipeafanu,! who at
tacked them, and that between two and
three hundred of them have been killed and

Mr. Pickeri'ig -is exceedingly popular and

deed a man of sterling worth and'good
sense. Of Mr. M'Henry I know .little,
but think well of him. The public there
fore is well disposed towards our executive
government, and will if need be fuppdrt it.
The jacobins know the crisis will overthrow
them or the government, and it is with that
forefight they flirin Roxbury and Milton.
I heard a neighbor _ shrewdly fay of gener
al Heath's speech in Roxbury town-meet
ing, that he spoke his book, and described
the terrors of war in a manner that no man
could who had not fell them. Is nothing to
be hoped from the house ? Will not the
common danger draw a few to unite with
the government, or do they refolre to fever
â the. tics.of our union ? Vigor and energy, if
the government could display them, would
bring down jacobin apportion to the dud,
and gain a new liability for our future peace

Yesterday the Austrian troops entered

ed their way to St. Mark's, about two
thousand' soldiers following in larger barges.
It was with difficulty they could pass thro'
the immeirfi concouife of small boats of eve
ry fort, which joy, cnriofity and example
had colleftcd, and which formed a striking
profpeft. All the houses along the canal
were hung with tapestry without doors, and
an immense people rent the air with cries nf
joy and applause. Arrived at St. Mate's
the convoy was fainted by a triple discharge
of artillery and a of the mui'qnet
ry of the Guard Bi.-urgeoife, who were on

RICHMOND, April 2.
ExtraS of a letter from Philadelphia, dated
March 25.
" Nothingmore has yet transpired in con
gress (ince the President's singular mefl'age.
It has been said, that he received on Thurs
day last some other dispatches, but I can
.not answer for the truth of the report.
Whether he has or has not, we may 'fee
plainly that he has determined on the plan
of giving congress nothing but what he
thinks will shew them the worst fide only,
and tend to irritate and provoke to Yiolent
measures."
