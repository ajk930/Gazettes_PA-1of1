TKURS.DAV EFT.NING, MAY 14:
FOU TIIE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES-
No. I.
Unanimity of opinion, among the citi
zens oi any country, on any threat national
fubjett, is much to be desired ; but in none
have the sentiments of the people more in
fluence on their government than in our's,
and, consequently, in nnne is this harmony
of judgment more efientially neceflary.
Were it poflible for the government of these
states to pnrfue, for any time, a system of
measures adverse to the receivsd opinion of
a majority of the people, it would be like
ftru ggl'Â»g w'fh a rapH torrent that must
soon bear down all opposition. This de
termined resolution of the people to think
for tisemfelves, and not to trull implicitly
to men even of their own choice, is favor
able to liberty on the one hand, but on the
other is not without its disadvantages
Every great and important measure, even if
the welfare of the country (liould require
it to lÂ»e immediately pursued, must wait the
flÂ«\V fanftion the people themselves, as
well as of theiir reprefentativeJ, before it
can he fafely aaopted. The instantaneous
apprwbatinn, or disapprobation, of so nu
merous a body as the citizens of the Uni
ted Ststes compose, is not to be looked for.
To form and cxprefs this opinion is a work
of time. Hence facrifices of the public
interest mull too often be made at the altar
of public opinion. That this position is
tenaSie the late tranfadlions, between our
government and that of France, unfortu
nately evince. What nation on earth, ex
cept our own, would have so patiently fub
mittcd to aggreflion after aggreflion ? For
five years have we been insulted as well as
injured by the French, During that pe
riod of time we have, with most astonishing
apathy, given up our deTencelefs merchants
an easy prey to the piratical cruisers of that
nation. We have patienily submitted to
injury after injuryâto insult after infu.'t.
Our forbearance may kave excited the con
tempt, but it not yet dffarmed the ra
pacity of tl4- French. We have been
punished on our knees, and have not yet
risen. It has been our lot greater
outrage and violence than ever yet pre
ceded an Â»pen declaration of war. A cer
tain description has been drawn that cum
piifes every vtflel of uur's that floats on the
ocean, bound to a foreign port ; and all
within its capacious limits is to be loft to
this country. " Stay at home, keep with
in the limits of your own eoaft," they fay
unto us, " and you {hall be undisturbed. We
will yet al.'ow you to visit each otherâbe
contented that this boon is left youâyet a
lit'le while and it may suit our pleasure to
divide with you under your own roofsâ
and even then we will have the lion's (hare.
The coasting trade we will fuffer a while
longer to reft undisturbed :âWere we to in
terrupt that, the poor fools would be obli
ged to open their eyes. Sufficient for us
willl be their rich European, East and Weft
Indian ships." This language is so plain
and intelligible that it has, at last, reached
our ears. Ihe rumour of discontent and
resentment begins to be heard. The Ame
rican, flow to aftion, begins to be roused ;
âthe poison worksâbut the antidote is at
hand. Let us resolve with one heart and
one foul to live free, and we are yet fafe.
Let there be no limits to our confidence
in the government of our choice: it were
better to trust it with even dictatorial power,
than to unnerve and enfeeble the arm ex
tended for our piotedlion.
The bleflings of honorable peace are
worth some facrifices ; but it cannot be be
lieved that ourgovernmentwould have made
so many, had it not been expedient to con
vince the people what it behoved them to
do. Long since was it neceflary, in my
humble opinion, to have resorted to the
measures now about to be adopted, had we
not been divided in our sentiments and at
tachments in relation to France. It is not
now for the firft time that our administra
tion has discovered the confirmed hostile
disposition of the French Repub ic to this
country; but it was important to a fuc
cefsful opposition that the people should
be united, and, one and all, assured of the
juflicc of our cause. Whenever this came
to be the cafe, we (hould be invulnerable .
the contrary situation would have been full
of danger and disgrace. Something more
than common violence was required to open
the eyes of the people. Strong in our at
tachments ro the French, and in our enmi
ties to the Englilh, it was not an easy mat
ter to change the current of the public
opinionâthat current which was accustom
ed to flow, in one course, for a long time
past, with such irrefiftable force. Had the
French set some bounds to their persecution,
it must still have gone on unrefifted. It i,
foitnnate for us that they have dropped
the veil of di(Timillation, and now ait and
speak out. It is iinpofiible any longer lo
doubt intentions which are so plain that
even those who run may read. We are, at
last, drawing our affections home, and con
centrating them upon their proper objeÂ£lâ
our own country. To the Â«' terribleor
t.ie " Scare Crow" nation, we return
" scorn for scorn." We are capable of
something more than scorn. History (hall
not yet prostitute her page to record that,
" in the eighteenth century there appeared
a coriftellation in the political hemisphere 1
that attradied the notice of all the nations
of the world. It (hone, for a few years, I
with unrivalled lnftre, and then set never to
rife again." By Heaven ! it (hall not be
said that the Americans of 76 were fnc
ceeded by a submissive and degenerate race,
that tamely furrendercd up (he liberties ai 4;
independence of their country without even
a struggle. There are too many Chips of
the old Block left, to allow this to be said
with truth. My brave youog Countrymen,
you who are coming forward and devoting
yourselves to the fervjea of your country,
cherifii the noble spiritâlet not the sacred
flame expireâtend it with more than vestal
vigilanceârefolva, like a band of Theban
brothers, to form a rampart of your bodies
, around the liberties and independence of.
your country. Think not, however, noble
youths, to have the entire honor of dc
fendingyour country : at lead one old man,
who has already fought and been wounded,
but not disabled, in the ferviaeof that coun
try, must be permitted to fli3re the honor
and the danger with you.

New Tori, May iqlh, 1798.
For the Gazette of the United States.
The advice of Solomon, " acknowledge God
in al! thy ways, and he will direct thy p*ths,"
is as fnitable and proper for nations as for indi
viduals ; and perhaps the President has in no of
ficial adl discovered so much wisdom, as ii? re
commending: to the people a' large to ftt apart
a day f r the purpoles mentioned in his procla
mation. The history df every age furnifhes in
{lances of the interference of divine providence
in favor of those nations and individuals who
have in a fnitable manner fought its friendlhip
and protection ; and rÂ«at of our own country in
particular contains many striking proofs of the
fail. Some of our earliest fertlements were
made in New England ; and the declared objeft
of the set tiers was f< ta advance the Kiagdom of
Â®ur Lord Jrfus Christ, and to enjoy the liberties
of the Gospel in Purity with Pea-e." People
a<fting with such views will neceflarily be in the
habit of depending on providence, and observ
ing i a various interpositions ; we are therefore
naturally led to their history in a cafe of this
kind, to fee what has been the event, and it is
pleasing to find among their records, proofs tfat
days of national penitence and humiliation have
been followed by the smiles of heaven, and by
national prosperity. It appears to have been
their common pra&ice upon 211 special and ur
gent occasions, to appoint a day of falling, hu
miliation and prayer ; and so remarkably were
they prafperedas a people, that when they had
been but 26 years in the country, the comtnif
fioners of the United Colonies thought it proper
to order, " that all the colonies should colleel the
special providences of God toward them," that
their poGerity might be grateful to God for his
mercy to their fathers, and be led to place their
confidence in him.-(*
In 1676 thÂ« Indians were very fuccefsful
against the people of New-England, and threat
ened their deftruÂ£Hon, particularly thofeof New-
Plyn outb. The government recommended the
observation of a faft, and the people cheerfully
concurred in it : and the following account of
the remarkable iflue is given by one of the feiflo
rians of that day. " This was the tranfa&ion
of this church ; and all the churches in the co
lony of New-Plymouth did, in a solemn man
ner, about this time renew their coyenant with
God on a day of humiliation: and it is never to
be forgotten how ready God was to hear the
cry of his poor people in the day of trouble, and
to save them : for immediately upon this motion
from authority" [for a last &c ] "and the
ch-urchc-s hearken,ing thereunto, God turned his
hand against our heztlien enemies, and subdued
them wonderfully ; and within a month after
cur solemn day, the greit head of all the mis- j
j chief, "Philip, was fliin ; the governor an.l ma- j
1 gi2.rates the week before his death sent an order
jto all our churches to keep August 12th as a day
j of publr tjiafikigjving for the beginning of re
! upon tKe enemy ; and on that v.-ry day,
loon after the public worihip was ended, his
his head was brought into Plymouth in great
triumph, he being slain two or three davp before;
lo that in the day < f our praise our eyes saw the
falvationof God."
I he New-England States continue to this day
in the praxflice of appointing annually a day of
i3fting, and another of thoukfgiviug ; and no
attentive observer can help remarking the hap
pine.s of their pi.litical situation in every re
lpeif>.
These instances (with many others which
might he added) evidently ftiew the propriety
and utility of national attention to religion, and
afford great encouragement to it I was there
fore much pleased to find the citizens so general
ly complying with the PrcHdentYrecommenda.
tion yellerday, and with their very suitable de
portment on the occasion : it was pleating in
every point of view ; for it not only contained
an acknowledgment of the superintending pro
vidence of God, and our dependance on it, but
it discovered an attachment to the government
under which wclive, and a very great unanim
ity among ourselves ; which will encourage our
rulers and strengthen their hands while it will
convince our enemies that we are far from being
the divided people they expelled to find us, and
thus naturally tend both to our frcurity and

Mf/Sitg reaves then called up tliÂ« Reso

Commanders of Public and Private Armed

ftead of referring the resolutions to the com

to the Committee of the Whole on the Stare

by a motion made by Mr. Da vis to.poUpone
the further consideration of these resolutions
until the second Tuesday in June. This mo
tion produced a debate which took up the re

ned without taking the question.
In the course of the fitting, the Senate sent
down a bill which they have pa fled, for con
currence, for the more effectual protection of
the commerce and the coasts of the United
States, which received its firlt reading. This
bill, as reported, appeared in this paper on
Monday.
To the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES
or AMERICA.
Sir,
THE Grand Jury of the county of Kent
in the Hate of Delaware, are im pre fled with
a belief, that it is their duty to express to
you their approbation of youreonduft as
it regards the Republic of France and
| other nations. With much fatisfa&ion\ve
have seen in your indru<stions to our Envoys
sent to negociate with France, your solici
tude to maintain peace, and the sincerity of
your endeavoring to continue her friend
fliip. While we admire the wisdom ard
moderation of our government, in her en
deavors to preserve peaee ; we have seen,
with indignation, every insult offered us as
a nation ; our overtures of reconciliation
flighted ; and the Ambafladors of peace and
friendftiip insulted, and every
species of provocation offered them ; our
citizens plundered when lawfully engaged
in the ordinary vocations of life ; our com
merce almost ruined; our merchants broken;
and our farmers, the support of their coun
try, unable to dispose of produce.â
Under these impressions, we pledge to you
our loyalty and fidelity.
We estimate the liberty we enjoy under,
we believe, the freed and bed constitution
that the wisdom of man ever formed; and
we feel, in a becoming manner, as the freed
people on earth ought to feci, under our
present circumstances.
The hardy sons ef America, who, in the
year '76, resisted with success the base at
tempts of the tyrant of Great-Britain to
enslave them, will not now, with their con
sent, become vassals to the tyrants of
France.
Your inftru&ions to and the dispatches
from our Envoys to the French government,
have bad the happy effeft of cementing our
country into one (>and, which we trull no
power on earth can break. Tbe unjust
and extortionate demands of France, will
deprive her of all advocates in America, and
conv nee our fellow-citizen 9 who have been
partial to her cause, while defending her
rights, and scourging the insolence of sur
rounding nations who attempted to interfere
with the internal government of iheir coun
try ; that fluflied with vi&ories, and grown
insolent by success, her views art changed,
and an insatiable third for power and domi
nation now governs her councils.
That Almighty God, who determines
the fate of nations and of individuals, by
wbofe permission or command all things are
done, may preserve the people of America
under all difficulties ; infpirc her rulers with
wisdom to fee, and grace to do that whieh
is right in his fight, is our sincere prayer.
Signed by the unanimous order of
the Grand Jury,
Manlote Emerson, Foreman.
Dover, May \itk> 1798.
To tbe Grand Jury of the County of Kent,

GENTLEMEN,
I THANK you for this address, pre
sented to me by your Representative in
(?ongrefs, Mr. Bayard.
The love of your country, approbation
of the conduft of government, resentment
of its wrongs, and resolution to support it,
are worthy of the chara&er of good citi
zens.
Witk you every good man will offer up
his prayers to Almighty God, that he may
preserve the people of America under all
difficulties, inspire their rulers with wis
dom and grace to do that which is right.

S 1 R,
THE inhabitants of the city rf Perth
Araboy in the State of New-Jcrfey, beg
leave at this important crisis, to join the- ge
neral voice of their fellow citizens in oth.r
parts of the United States, in expreflmg to
you their sincere and unequivocal approbati
on of the measures whi h have bsen adopted
and pursued by the government, to preftrve
the blefiings of peace to the courtry, and
particularly to reitore harmony wich the
Republic of Fiance.
We refleA with gratitude on the eavnell
solicitude and fucctlsful endeavours of your
illustrious Predecessor, to avoid a participa
tion in the defolatory European War ; and
we acknowledge with plcafure a correspon
dent fentimer.t, on a review of the wife, firm
and patriotic measures of your Adminiflra
tion.
Although we deprecate a war with any
nation, and deplore the profpeft that now
threatens our peace ; yet under such aafp \Â»
ces, and relying on the unanimity of the
people and the juftics of our cause, we may
look forward with confidence to the favour
able issue of a contest, even with that nation
who, flulhed with viftory, has insolently
threatened our country with the humiliating
fate of Venice.
The exercise of a foreign influence in the
United States is so degrading, that we trull
every American will repel with indignation
any attempt of that natureâFor ourselves,
we disdain the spirit that would bend to a
mean subserviency to the views of any foreign
power whatsoever.
Feeling an unlimited attachment to and
confidence in the Government of the Unit
ed States, we do not hesitate to declare our
determination to support, to the u'tnoÃ of
our power, every measure deemed neceflary
for the defence of the honor, interest, and
independence of our Country.
By the unanimous order Â»/ the Meeting.
JOHN ANGUS, Chairman.
ANSWER.
To the Inhabitants of the city of Perth Amboj)
in the State Â»f Netv-'Jerfey.
Gentlemen,
I THANK yon for your unanimous Ad
dress, ordered at a general meeting, and pre
sented to me by the Speaker, Mr. Dayton,
and for joining the general voice of our fel
low citizens, in exprtffing their sincere and
unequivocal approbation of the measures
which have been pursued by the Govern
ment, to preserve the bleffingsof peace, and
reflore harmony with the republic of France.
Your eratitude is juftlycue to the earned
folicitnde aÂ»d fuccetjfcl endeavours of my
illustrious PredecefTor, to avoid a participati
on in the desolating European War ; and
your acknowledgment of a correspondent
sentiment, on a review of the measures of my
Administration, does me great honour and
receives my belt thanks.
Relying on the unanimity of the pe pie,
and the juflice of our cause, we may look
forward with confidence to a favourable ifiue
of any necessary contest, with any nation,
however inflated with viftorics.
It is too much to expeft, that every A
merican will repel with indignation any at
tempt at a foreign influence ; some will raise
their hopes of ambition, and others of ava
rice, upon such influence. These paflions,
if not controlcd by a religious, sacred sense
of m ral obligation, wil, soon form a formi
dable party in any nation, especially in a
commercial nation.
That the morals and religion of th s coun
try have been attempted, by measures the
moll daring and by others the moil insidious,
for tiii" vervpurpofe of ertfting and aiding
a foreign influence, I appeal to yonr own
observation and submit to your refleflions
I givis )ou full credit, for your disdain of
the spirit, that would bend to a fubfer
viency to the views of any foreign power.
For your attachment to the Government
of the United States and confidence in it ;
and for your determination to fapport, to
theutmollof your power, every measure
nrceffaty for the defer.ee of the honor, ints
relt, and independence of our Country,
you deferÂ»e the highest praise of the bell
Citizens.

COMMUNICATION.
A letter from the minister ot general police to juf
ticasof peace, See, of Parisdated iÂ§th Ventofc, gives
a frightful, but no doubt a very jult, pifiurc of the
prefect ftateof that city, with refpe& to moralsâit it
too long to tienfcribe; I therefore present you only
with a short extract.
0 The excess of libertinism, and the licence of
prostitution, are at their height; almost every quar
ter of Paris is the public theatre of them; th s dido,
lution of manners has been produced not foleiy by
thehabl's of vice to which y*ung people, left to their
own guidance, have abandoned themselves, drawn at
firft l>y the heat of blood and an irregular appetite soÂ»
' p'eafweâthis debauchery even precedes vouth ; and
infamous lust has corrupted infancy itfe f.'*
He then proceeds to excite the feverityof the laws
in reprefling of at leatt moderating theexeefs of thete
thÂ»ags ; but may it not be asked whateffeft can laws
or tribunals have on the moials of a people, wbefo
government, or rather whose tyrants have publicly
proscribed all religion, whÂ» have impi .ufly dared to
brave the deity and to deny his existence ?âTheir in
famous attempt to feducea whole nation to darkness
and infidelity, mud and will recoil with vengeance on
the heads of the reducers, and their poileHty will
bitterly repent the horrid deeds of the present day.
HAGUE, March 7.
Day before yelterday the pnrjeft of our

REVOLUTION IN ROME.
Ci-devant Miftreft of the IVorld.
Rome, March 2.âThe events which oc
curred upon the entrance of the French in
to this city, prevented us from anticipating
those we have witnefled. The joy caofed
by our revolution appeared unanimous
Since thg morning of the 16th February,
the arms of the French republic hatj been
placed in front of the academical palace of
the nation. On the summit of every emi
nence, on tSe top of the palaces of the most
diftinguilhed personages, was seen flÂ»atirtg
the banner tricolor. It had replaced the
sword in the hand of the statute on the '
castle of St. Angelo.
On the anniversary of the coronation of
Pius VI. the day when the cardinals were
atfembled in Chapter, the patriots,
in concert wiih the French, had made everv
preparation for planting the trie cf liberty
About 10 o'clock, a review of the tn)qpj
was ordered, at which the whole city was
present. At the fame moment was seen, is
suing from the convent of St. Frarcis. a
proctflion of a kind, rare in this city. Thofe l
religious emblems regarded by the Remans
as the sole objefts worthy of reiprft, had
been replaced by that of liierty ; and the tree
consecrated to her was brought forward,
and borne by a groupe of citizens. The pro
ceflion made the tour ot Campo Viccino >
and it was a lingular fpeftacle to fee a'num
ber of prieflts itnd monks lend their broad
(houlders to bear the tree of liberty. Arrived
at the arch of SeptimusSeverus, the French
'officers present exclaimed Vive lePeuple Re-.
main, and the cry was repeated with accrtits
.of univepfal enthusiasm, The army marchedifterthe peopleâtheprocefibnafc.TiJjd ih j
Capitol and the liberty tree was planted be
fore the ftatueof Marcus Aurclius, which
ornamented with tricolor ribbawds
and fringes. Unanimous acclamations far;&-
icned the triumph of liberty. Every citi
zen of either sex, by a fraternal fencimcnt,
feeined to have but voice and one heait.
A deputation wai afterwards sent to the
camp of the commander in chief for his ap
probation.
aft by which the city of Rome was
rvenerated had beendigefted by fournotaries,
and it was read aloud, ft contained in sub
stance ; â-That the Roman people dpteft d
the crimes of which the prieftly government
made itfelfchargeableagaind the French
Republicâthat it resumed its sovereignty,
and implored the support of the grandnation.
After which the aft was approved by cries
of joy, and fubferibed by an immense mul
titude.
The general received the deputation of j
the people with tbe utmoll affability, and in j
the name of the French Republic declared :
ROME, an INDEPENDENT REPUB
LIC ; at the fame time offering Â£O,OOO
frenchmen to defend its liberty. He then i
returned to the camp amid the acclamations
â¢or the pcopl -.
Meanwhile the Cardinals, at theclofe of 1
meeting, aflembled in the hall of the
Va'tcan, and their abfo'ute renun- j
ciatiorr of temporal government. General j
Oevone afterwards went in feirch of the ;

its protection. The Pope then appeared,
if not fatisfied, at least resigned.
The 16th, it was announced by procla
mation that a solemn mass would be celebra
ted the following day, by the Cardinals, but
thrt for this ceremony a brief from his Ho
lincfs was *quifitcâthat afterwards Te
Drum would be sung in solemn gratitude for
the regeneration of the Roman Peopleâand
this Proclamation contained 1 hefeex preflions,
so proper to reconcile othodoxy with liberty.
** That the foundation of every political af
foc ation was religiou, and that God was
the author of religion and liberty."

We have joft finifhed eanvafifing vhe votes for 1
feprefentatives of this State in Congress, and I
now enclose the state of them. The result is
highly fatisfa&ory to the lovers of our govern
ment and national independence, and will be
equally mortifying to the partizar.s of French in
fluence.
The following is the statement of votes given
Â£or the present reprefeatatives in Congress from
this State, contralied with the votes for known
-oppofers of our government.

In this statement the whole force of oppof:- |
tio.nis exhibitedâand 440 is the number. Such
i* tie <i great change of sentiment" which
Green leaf announced ! But it mull be remem
bered thit the legal voters in the State amount
to fifteen or twenty thousand ; and if they could
all be brought to attend at the ele&inn, the ac
tual majority ofÂ» deci ied'fupportera vf our gov
ernment, would be found from 40 to 50 for one.
The people of this State, not only l have not
changed, but they never qjuilL change, while
the government is admmiftered without corrup
tion. There may be strength eqÂ®ugh in France
to exterminate the inhabitants of Connecticut :
â bttt I there is ftct force enough on earth to
subdue thtmâto make them renc unce their pre
sent government, institution* and principles, or
to tributary.
â¢It i 6 a remarkable proof of the fpiiit of the
people in this State, that a few days ago the
masons at an officers, left out of of
fice their Grand Mafterand other officers, fo'e-
Jy on the ground of their democratic principles,
a proof of public virtue excrcifed against private
rejpeft and fritndjhip, that enrols the brethren
among the belt Â»f patriots.
It is with lingular pleasure I mention that a
firm and spirited address to the Frefident in this
crisis pifl'ed th? Council unanimously-, and the
FJnufe of Repiefeutatives, with only two dif
fering voices âthe votes were 169 to 2. With
this faft, 1 leave the partizans of France and
Atheilm to enjoy their exultations over the de

briskly by means of a secret correfpondsace carried
on with the Aga or primate of that quarter, whom
PalTwan o*lou had raised to that polt. The rebels
were not only driven from Tirnowa, but they were
obliged to retreat precipitately upon Widdin. Paf
fwan Oglou has, it is said, collefled his principal
forces in the environs of that fortrefs, which he is
caufmg to be put in the be ft slate of defence. They
relate, that the garrison which he left at Nicopotfs,
lately discovered a subterranean excavation in which
they found a great number of tons of powdei, in
perfeft order. Paflwan Oglou has had it conduced
to Widdin.

HAVING observed an advertifemcr t of CÂ»
Gullager, in terms derogatory of our pro
fcffional abilities, we have to requdft the public
not to be imposed upon by foreign artists ; but to
decide upon the merits of each by a coir.parifon ot
the work extcuted by both, as it is a mode almost
universally adopted by them to invalidate the ta
lents of ellabliftied artists with a view of deceiv
ing the public, and engrofling that business which
their profefiional knowledge in no wife entitles
them to. Wei] knowing that public opinion must
govern, we flatter ourfelve6 that the work execut
