J: .. The following Chara&er of this work
is eitrafled from the Monthly Review, p. 311, 312, for
1 . . Mkreh, 1793-
I !' We have no-fmssll degree of-pkafnre in announcing
j the work to our readers ; as one wh eh. from the
I lietdom of itseoquiry, the grandeur of itsviews, and the
j fortitude of its principle, is eminently defersing of atten-
I tion. By thfreulogium, we would by 1.0 means be under
j stood to fubferibe to all the principles which these volume
j contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived at that degree of
1 certainty which is requisite, for any two men to think a
j like on all fobjeds; neither has language attained that con-
I fiftent accuracy, which can enable them to convey their
thoughts, even when they do think alike, in a manner per
fe&ly correct and intelligible to both. These difficulties
I are only td be overcome by a patient, inceflant, and bene
] volent inveftigatien.
" Many of the opinions which this work contains, are
I bold ; foaae of them are novel; and fomc doubtless are er
' roneofc âbut that which ought to endear it even to those
â whose principles it may offend, is the strength of argu
ment.adduced in it to prove, that peace and order moll ef-
I feSually promote the happiflefs after which political re
formers are panting ; âthat as the progreli of knowledge
L-y ! is gradual, political reform outfit not to be precipitate ; â
of and that coiivntfive violence is dangerous not only to icdi
s vidaals (for that rcfulc comparatively would be of small
accoffnt) but to the general cause of truth. It i< the op
-1 polite cf this principle that inspires the enemi?scf pofitic
ââ ' I al enquiry with so much terror ; it is the fn 'pou" ion that
a j change muft'inevitably be attended by the turbulence and
h, injullice of commotion; an.l tjlit innovation c r.not be
j made without the intervention of evils more dettru&ivc
â than those which are intended tpjaexelormed. Under the
I cocviclion of this philanthropic sentiment, of calm ami'
I gradual refcrm, (which in its proper place he has fully :i-
I luftrated) Mr. Godwin proceeds without firlltoen
" j quire into prefeut evil, through its effetitial branches, ar.d
I next to dciijomtrate future good.
I "" Dividing his Work into eight books, and making tjil
c ,J iufHTiNCC or Political institctiÂ«vs the iubjeci of

I tence of government ovy the moral habits of mankind ;

' Extracts of Letters from Charleston, dated 14th
and 19th June.
" 1 informed you of a dreadful fire having hap--
pened, by which 60 or 70 houses had been confam
p cd ; bnt alas ! it feetns the ruin of Charleston is de
termined on. Since yesterday, 3 o'clock PM, till
now, 7 PM, at Jfeaft 250 dwelling-houses are in
a(hes by an Incendiary. The fire caught behind
Penman's and Coirie's Stores : the latterjoft a good
deal. All the north fide of the Bay, from Pen
man's new (tore to Church street, all the oppoiite
part of ftieet, great part of Union street,
all Lodge alley, great pait of Union street contin
ued, all the east and weft fide of Church street,
from Qneen to Broad street, M'Kenzie's, Doctor
Joseph Kamfey's, and Blacklock's houfe# and the
north fide of Broad street to the Beef market, and
from thencc to Queen street, none but two houses
are (landing.
The fire was partly flopped in Whitman, the
Silverfmith'shoufe, which being of Brick, and til
ed, prevented it from spreading farther. The wind
was high at the time, and 1 expe&ed it to cross
Broad-street, after which all the southern part of
the Bay would have gone. Only five houses on the
Bay, from the corner 1 of Queen ftreft, were burnt.
lCinloch's house, all Kinloch's court are in ruins ;
the old Church steeple was three times on fire, but
saved by a great reward and greater exertions. Dr.
Carter's lioufe and the neighbouring ones were pul
led down ; a great number of Houses were blowft
up ; several lives were loft, and many worthy peo
ple were hurt.
I was present at the fire of 1786 t but that, as
well as erery other I have ever seen, was a mere il
lumination in comparison with this ; the column of
fire was tremendous, and spread in different directi
ons at the fame time.
Again "! a frefh fire, from u(hich I just now
came, the Bake-house of Gaillard, in Elliot-street,
was on fire, but happily extinguished. The streets
are almost impassable for the furniture and'goods
â saved lying all about. The general loss is immense.
19th.
" The confufion the whole town has been fhrown
into by the late dreadful fire, is the reafen of the
delay the vessel has experienced. I add only a few
lines to the endofed narrative. Since Monday
night, every day one or two frefn attempts have
been made to set on fire the remaining part of Â»he
! once flourifhing city of Charleston. This morning
' was pgain noticed by an attempt, all or mod by
Negroes; who, when surprised and taken, shew
handfuls of money, which they fay they received
from whiie-fac'd villains, to encourage them in this
.lifaftrousbulinefs/ Where it will end, God knows.
The inhabitants are worried out with fatigue. Con
stant watching, patroling, and doing duty onguaid,
is enough to cut down the healthicft man. 1 shud
der, when going home, to pass through a long lane
of fmoaking ruinr., where you are conttantly expof
cd to falling chimnies or threatening walls. The
distress of so many families, lying in Churches and
out houses ft ill fmoaking, makes my heart bleed.
In Broad-street, Mr. Jack's house .flopped the
flames.
Â«' The villains always watch the wind, ta make
a new attempt on a freth quarter. Had we but
once a plentiful shower, I should deep found. All
business is at an end : and if the Banks had not i
come to the enslofed refolutiohi, every note would
have been pretested.
" May your city never experience a like difaftet, 1

CIRCULAR LETTER agreed upon by the *
citizens of Charleston, June 19. ,
Friends and Fellow Citizen r, j_
United co you by the endearing ties of private
friendlhip, and a common citizenship, vise feel our- | Â£
selves encou'aged to apply to you for aid in the
work ot benevolence, imposed upon us by the defo- f
latingfire, which has recently ruined a fair portian g
of our city. I t
Scarcely liad we recovered from the confufian
and distress arillng from ttie fire, which laid wa!te
the upper part of the city âscarcely had we enjoyed
the melanCholy x pleafure of diflributing the fruits of
the benevolence of the citizens, to the amouut of
10,000 dollar#, amongst the sons and daughters of
affli&ion, than we are agin aflailcd by a heavier ca
lamity. A fire more rapid, extensive, devouring rl
and irrefiltable than any we have experienced for
nearly twenty years, sweeps off a great part of the tt
city, deflroying houses, forniture, and goods, to
an immense amount, and reducing many indulirious
families to famine and to ruin.
Time has not yet allowed us to calculate the ex-
tent of the loss, but a partial view exhibits the mi- "
ferable picture of 300 houses reduced to aflies,
and of4oo families driven for fhÂ«lter into the hou- n
fes of their friendsâinto the buildings appropriated P
to the comfort of the poor, of the orphan, and olf a
the helplefisâwhich being inefficient to afford
(helter, some of the unfortunate vidtiifts have been 1
obliged to convert the House of God <into the a- Â®
bode of man, and to take refuge at the altar# P
Many are reduced from affluence to beggaryâ R
almotl all who have been burnt out have fullaiied n
great losses, and are placed in circumstances which 1
call for immediate relief. "
Every exertion is making by the citizens of the
town to alleviate the miseries of these unfortunate *'
fellow creatures. Every heart feels for their dif- *
trclTcs. Every hand is open for their relief. Much i
has been done and more will certainly be doneâbut ll
much remains for the exercise of the friendly affec- T'
tions. The resources of the inhabitapts of the city 1!
already exhausted by the almofl continued draughts
made upon them, by the unfortunate of oui own, as
well as of foreign coun ties, are inadequate to meet
the exigence of the present eiiormous evil. n
Where can we turn for assistance so natwally, or l '
we trull so efficacioufly, as to our friends and bre- P
thren of the country, whose interefl and whose as-
feftions are bou.id up with ours, and who fhsre in 1!
our prosperity, and in ouradverfityâwe are com-, "
manded by the voice of this community, to rmke P
the appeal to the feelings of -our fellow citizens in
the country; and we make the appeal in the cotifi- 1,1
dense that it will be effectual ; and that they will "
readily seize the occasion of co-ope r ating with lis, "
in ths great duties offeeding the hungry, cloathing
thp naked, fhehering the houseless, and eomfortiiig
â the afflidted. Â®

[Gffl. Finekney's draught of a petitian.~\ .
To the honorable the Speaker and the other Mem
bers of the House of Representatives of the [
.V State of.South-Carolina.
The Memoiial and Petition of the citizen* of' f
Charlellon, i
Refpeftfully fheweth, â¢ ' r
That a confjderable part of their city has been- r
lately tedueed to ashes by two dreadful and deftruc-
Vive fires. j
That the frequency of fires, and the extent of t
their devaluation in this city, has been chiefly occa-' t
fioned by many of the houses having been built v
with wood, and by mote having been covered with t
Ihingles. ]
1 hat the building and covering houses in this c
manner, not only endangers the prope ty of the e
proprietors of them, but renders insecure the hou- 1
fes of other citizens in their vicinity, built of brick c
or Hone, and covered with slate or tile. t
T hat thrfe fires do not only oecafion great loss <
and damage to those whose properties are immedi- t
ately cohfumed, but the injury sustained extends r
widely, and involves many others in the ruinous con
fequeuces ; they even cause a diminution ot the t
public revenue, as vacant lots pay a much less tax 1
to the slate and city, than lots improved. 1
That as it is contrary to the social compact for 1
any person to make fitch ufeof his property as will 1
be to his neighbour, and as your petition- 1
-ers are thoroughly convinced, by fad experience, of ]
the pernicious consequences of their building with i
wood or coveting with shingles, they most earnestly
request yon to ordain, that the outfiJe of all buil
dings,hereafter to be erected in the city of Charles- 1
ton, or within half a mile thereof, be henceforth
built ofbrick, (tone, tabey, or fonÂ»e other in combus
tible material, with party walls of the fame ; and that
ah buildings which shall hereafter he covered within
the abova limits, be henceforth covered with either
ilate, tile, ftone,brick, tabey,or some other in com
bullible materia!; and that you will make such fur
ther provision, as to your wisdom (hall seem meet
to prevent, as far as human care and forefight can
prevent, the repetition of the dreadful calamities
they have fuftered.

REEPF OF THE SESSION OF-PitRJ-'IAMENT. n
Yesterday the session dosed - ; it may be ufetnt-Toâ'
review it. t<
The opening oti the part of, government was 'I
moderate confiftrnt and firm ; on the part ef oppo- v
fition, insidious and malignant. a
Administration recommends an attention to the e
state of provisions, the restoration of internal tran â¢ a
quillity, and the moll vigorons means of profecut- b
ing the War, if peace could not be obtained.
Pledged on the war, oppofitian acquiesce-; oti the w
meafuic offecttrity, they attempt todelude the p;o- d
pie by unmÂ»aning inquiry into the Ilate of the poor; si
and as to internal tranquility, they make aft effort
to decry the means of preserving it, and to cerffure S
the per sons who had been molt adtive in suppres
sing They fnrther endeavor to im- h
put-e to government a design of introducing religi-. tl
gious per'fecution 4 and try the temper of parlia- Â«
merit on the exploded principle of introducing Bri- si
tifh party as the engine of Irish opposition. The h
druggies of la ft session are attempted to be revived
âthe authors of the renunciation aft are reprefen- -e
ted as the enemies of Trilh Indeprndenre 4 Mr.
Fox iÂ» held up at a Comet, id whom Ireland is to t'
jbe the the Briffotint experiment of appealing ii
to the people againfl the government of England, is t
revived; and the sedition of Francis [treet Chapel, h
! is repeated in the senate with all the aifeftation ef o
fludied plagiarism. si
The country gentlemen of Ireland were not to o
be enraptured by their language ; neither sedition p
nor difaffeftion, nor British party, were lures to
their underflanding: they thought their livr-s,their
properties, the constitution, their country in
danger ; they felt that the adminiltrarion was act
ing sincerely and hotielliy for theii preservation, v
( and they refufed to be the dupes of disappointed '
party. P
Oppofition,hnding no support, and that every at- 0
to gain strength disclosed increasing weak- e
ness, soon relaxed their efforts, and funk 'by degrees
into a faint approbation, or faint abuse, of the mea
sures of government.
Lad year the magnitude of the supply had been
extolled and le great eft effort of
Ireland, -nd ly - tii.'.tc -o the unexampled
popula.ity r â  Hiof the day: this
'e has been car
. ;e* v. but -~-ithiiUt sny parade.â
' in Â» two icjih is thisâthat the
ame fos-v - Â» was lalt year p <*ii' d'by a loan
' if 5 'I. us the cur re at icrvice, is this year
uppoijed by a loan of 700,000!. only. Such has
been the economy of government, that a faring of
joo.oool. has been brought to the public credit.
A judicious floppage of the expert of grain, en
fured plenty to the people, and a wife invefligation
diflipated alarm. The price of corn through
out Europe had encouraged a great fpectvlation in â¢
Ireland corn was bought up in great quantities for
export, and hence the temporary high price : but
speculation has ovei'fhdt its mark ; corn is falling t
in England ; the profpeftof the next harvefl is pro t
mifing ; of course adventure will soon cease, and f
reasonable and cheap prices will return.
No parliamentary measure has been taken for the 'si
poor : mod .wifelyâfor no parliamentary measure f
can serve them. When government proclaims that c
the kingdom increases in prosperity year after year, 1
whether in war or peace, it follows of ccturfe that t
the situation of the poor mult be daily meliorating , t
Prosperity arises from an increased supply of pro {
duce and manufactures % but thefeare the result of I
employment and induflry the poor -can only be
benefited by employment and industry. If then the
country .gradually prospers, it is a sure ted that in'
dullry and employment are increasing, and confe- 1
quently that the poor ate better supported ; for as 1
there is more demand for labor, the price of labor >
rife* with the demand.
With regard to the diilurbanees of the kingdom, <
the conduct of the government has been niafl judi- Â«
cious; it has avoided committees of inqniry, from- : 1
unwillingness to produce materials which might 1
llamp either disgrace or suspicion on persons or par- ' <
ties, where convicting evidences could not be always ;
fubflantiated : it has relied more properly on the
public notoriety and the public feeling. In apply- 1
ing the remedy to diilurbanees, its policy has been
preventative and not vindrftive : it has aimed itfelf
with the greatell powers, but confined the right of
exercising them to the dillurbed diflrifis alone. .
The infurrcftion law is the policy of the day 5
the operation ofthe civil bill jtirifdiftion is a mea
sure of perpetual efficacy. The government of
Lord Weftmoreiand had much merit in placing the
most efficient characters on the bench ; the present
government has ensured the continuation of that
wife policy, by increasing the fahry of the judges,
so that even the place of a puisne judge will now be
1 an object to men of leading business in the hall.â
i This is, however, a measure in which I ihink go
vernment is peculiarly felf interefled ; for if any 1
thing more than another can attach them to the j
constitution of their country, it is the confidence 1
that jufiice at all times will be ably and impertially !
adminiflered. A bad judge is of more disservice
i to government than the most furious opposition.
. In increasing the salary of the judges, a wife provi
sion is introduced to fecurt their going circuit ; the
; defalcation from their salary is made so great as to
> bÂ« an efFectual counterpoifi: to indolence; the as
r. j. fi/.e-i A'lll be tefpe&aK!Â«; for the biiinefs of civ!' ?

Tlte house resolved itfelf into a committee of
-> the whole hpufe, on the slave carrying bjl.
S Mr. Wilberforce said, that what he now meant "
'* to propose went merely to make some alteration in
r the number of ilaves that were to he carried, in or- Â®
der to prepare the islands for abolition, which was e
so great an object with many. He wilhed to render]
the (laves somewhat dearer, in order to encourage
the good treatment of them, and to prevent ,e
new settlements of them being formed. By this m
means a total ahoKtion might be effe&ed in the mm- _
â¢ nrr moft-Jgtired by in u>c uuur..
_Jscfherefore would move that the number of slaves
to a ton Ihould be limited to one for every ton, when
.5 the tonnage of the ship was zoo, and four for ea r
). very five tons above that quantity of tonnage.â
and likewfe that no more (hips (hould tie allowed to
e eiÂ»ter into tiie trade tlian those now engaged in it ; ' e
i. and he proposed that the blanks in the bill should T<
be filled up with that proportion. as
A long and desultory conversation erifued, in
e which Mr. Jenkinfon, General Tarleton, Mr. Dun* ' c

four fire-places Â®n the second floor, with a very fine high
garret, in which there are two fire-places, with a hand

the Mines for the works, two of which are of the best
â¢quality, one so near that a single horse and cart will bring â
ten tons per day, the other, a team of four horses may ]j
bring fix tons. Besides the above there are several other n
tpines of inferior quality very convenient, the iron of h
which is good for nails, and when mixed makes excellent o

ply for the furnace may be had, but also any quantity for I
building or manure. Within less than a mile of the fur
nace is about twenty acres of the best double spruce for 'j
beer, and near it is a celebrated mineral spring; and two a ,
anda half miles from the furnace, within the trad, are i r
two valuable sites for Forges and Saw-Mills, on an excel- t(

Ail that VALUABLE ESTATE, called u
Booneton Iron-Works, u
Situate in the county of Morris, within eighteen miles 01
of Newark Landing, and eight miles oi Morris.-To\vn : e<
containing about three thousand five hundred acres of land n<
lying on both fides of Rockaway river, for near four th
miles. p<
On the premises is a FORGE with four fires and two
hammers, in complete repair, which embraces the whole ar
river, a SLITTING MILL, built in the most approved
manner, with two furnaces for heating iron, with roils
pillars, cutters, and every other apparatus in 'he most com- ly
plete ordsr, with a blacksmith's Ihop, coal-heufe, &c &c.
On the fame dam is a very comp!eat SAW MILL ; so
that the flittir g-mill has the full command of the whole
river, with a head of twelve fcef.
Immediately below, End on another dam, is an excel
lent new GRIST-M(LL, with two run of ftV.nes, and
constructed lor a third. The mill is large, and conveni
ent for a merchant mill, and situate in Â« country which
will afford a conltajit supply of grain.
All the works are in compleat view of the mansion-house,
and within half a mile of it, which is a handsome, build
ing, with five rooms on tbe firft floor with fire places, and
' four rooms up stairs, all in excellent repair, with a hrge
kitchen and cellars, and a well of excellent water at the â

house, i'awl-houfe, corn-crib, root-house, good barns and
stables, &c. &c. Also, within view of the manfion
houfe, are twelve dwelling-houses, a counting-houle, a
stone houfs, occupied as a store for the country and work?
a large convenient house, with fix rooms, with fire

are for fof-gemen, millers, &c There is, adioiuine the
store, a POT-ASH WORKS, in compleat order, r. black
smith's ihop, and wheelwright's shop, and other conveni
eut appendages.
As Rockaway river runs through this estate about four ~
miles, in which diftancc near twenty mill-sites may be
made, so as'.o occupy the whole of this very valuable and
confumt supply of water, it may be justly considered as a (
very valuable ot>jcÂ£l for any person or perfoas desirous of
going into the manufacturing line.
