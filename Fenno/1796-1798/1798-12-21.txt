That he failed from Curracoa in the said

which he and his four people arrived at Cur
â  racoa, and -that the)' arrived at the Ilics of

instant came James Conner, failing mailer,
laevi Bordine, lirft mate, and Lifter A fguith ,
second iraK, all late of the said schooner
Amphitrite, who havmg bPen also severally
duly fivurn, did confirm the foregoing, fofar
as relates to the failing 'from Ncw-YorL,an<i
until said Snf II left the lilt?*: of llois.
Afterward:;, that is to fay, on the 22d
instant, caine said Th.oma; Sncll and Frede
rick Maretk. Said BaR-th having beenduh
fworn, deix>fecl tliat lie went with said Tho
mas Snell to thelllesof Avis, andthefeafl
ed as interpreter on the following oicaficn":
that on their arrival at the Ilies of Avij,
they found a privateer under french Coiouis
(but owned as they are informed in. Curracoa)
called, " Fhurde la Mer," comciajided by
Pierre d'l'ine, lylfi j at anchor.
That the day before their arrival at the
Isles of Art'i. the said Pierre d'Pine had
made prifonrri vf all the people 'if th# Am
phitrite, who remained thern and had taken
posT flion of all tliey had got un shore from
the wreck, with the vcflcls log book, jour
nal, Sic. and that by order of one or the
privateers prize mailers, a httt where some
"f the people lived, was burned wiib all tbeir
clo ! es.
That the privateer being then under way,
said Pierre d'Pine ordered the deponents to
come on boaid the privateer, and ail
the Amphitrite'* papers with them. ' ' le â 
-privateer fron after came to arch or, when
the deponents along wiihcapr. Corfon Â«etÂ»t
on board, when the (aid d'Pine demanded
the papers. A letter from thÂ« governor of
Curracoa, at d a certificate from the said
consul were harded him, both which he trea
ted with grejt contempt, and told them that
he wat governor of the lflesof Avis, aod
that he would t?kc from ihc Â«fr;ck of thefchconer Amphi.n'te v'.ist he th -u?Ht pro
pfr, and evtir liiiug from the fiiore that he
might wa-.it which i.ad teen saved from the
wrrck- -he liad already taken poff-fTion of
tlie Amphitrite's boat. ordered thepeo
pie Â«Â» go o" board the Spa .ifli schooner with
what e'loaths they had on ; he gave them
two lirtireU of beef, part tit four half barrels
of fiiinr, and half a barrel of bread. He then
demanded u-lsnow what was become of all
the arm., povfdCj &c* Captain Sntil told
him that he did not know, that he believed
i.c had in hit poffefinin already all that had
been f ved from the wreck ;to which he
replied ht had not, and laid that the people
had hid them under ground, and that if
did pot tell him where every article was, he
would put him and bis people on a faod key.
without bread or water, or would _ carr 7
them to St. Domingo and put them in pn
fon. Gapt. Snell replied that he was in his
power, and that he might do as he thought
proper, that he could not tell him what he
did ;iot know ; afterwards he told said Sncll
he might go on board the Spanilh schooner
if he plealed, which he did, and llaid with
the people of the Amphitrite.
That on the morning of the 19th iiflant,
a signal was hoisted by the Spanish schoo
ner for the priÂ»aicer to fend a boat on board
(they having nun of their own) which they
did and the deponents went on board the
privateer âI hat previous to their leaving
the privateer the saw the Araphitrite'a boat
with a number of the privateers people row
ing for the wreck ; and ab-utfuaclown, ihey
returned loadtd with tigging, gunpow
der, bu tcr, See.âThat thus finding the
determination of the said Pierre d'Pir.e was
to take every thing from the wreck, they
asked her ptrmi'lioH to fail for Curracoa,
which he granted, and ordered hi* b >at bat
tled up to put them on board the fpanifli
schooner; mean time, and while the boat
was getting ready, he told them that the
Americans were a pack of villains without
humanity ; and rather than thev (lionld favt
a (ingle thing from the wreck he would set
fire to her, bum her upâThat soon after
they were put on board the Spanilh schoo
ner, 7 o'clock. P. M. of the 19th inft. they
got under way-and the next day, at 3P.
M. they arrived at depo
nents thereupon for thereafons above wrtten,
do protest, and I the said Consul at their
requetl, do hereby foleinnly protest, agair.ft

ner out of her course, which caused her to

and crew for having deprived th#m of 'he
property saved from the wreck of the Am

Â»f all due deference to these foi-difant Ameri

BtrndDufly agitates the civilized word, in
other light, titan whether we (Americans 4s
well as Europeans) lhall exchange tlie man
ners of the prelent age, for thole which pre
vailed in Rome, in the mofl corrupted it ate
of the commonwealth. The delicjn cf thole
t- who effected tlie revolution in France, and
)' now take the lead in the affairs of that re-
It publie, evidently is, to overthrow the pre
(t lent governments in Europe and to eltahlifh
ie democracies in their stead. Conneited with
d this intention, it is their plan and primary
y object to deltroy the â¢ Christian Religion,
I- which is intimately interwoven with, and
r a main of the exifling ellablifhnients.
:, This undoubtedly was the motive which
5, carried their arms into Italy, and prompted
e the demolition of the Papal power. The
>7 feenrity cf the present usurpers, is an addi
n tional and perhaps still ftrcnger reason for
0 1 their eÂ»rtions to change the f.tce of Europe;
r| as upon the e\tenf:on of theii principles they
y j nult chiefly depejid for tlw preservation of
11 their power, and perhaps of their lives. So
n ! loflg as the monarchial form of government
;- shall be fartiion.ible they have to dread a co
- alition for the re floration of monarchy in
v ] France ; but if they succeed in their demo
-') cratizing ft heme, they are at once freed from
r thir darker.
p As the French revolution was flrfl set on
. foot by their literary men, it has been pret
n ty genetally countenanced by that class of
e philofopliers in other countries, wjio have
s been more conversant with the natural than
- moral world, aud with books than men ;
- and it is observable that in all their opera
â¢ tions, much attention has been paid by the
t propaganda to flattering the propejifities of
- this defcriptipn of mankind. Hence their
- affectation of a love for the arts, their adop
: tion of the Roman manners and revival of
1 the Roman names in the countries they have
5 revolutionized. The conquest of Italy, and
r translation of the great master pieces of
sculpture and painting to Paris, as well as
1; the present expedition to Egypt, which is
1 alio a fort of clafiic ground, and the theatre
s on which Alexander and Cxfar and the o
ther heroes of antiquity had formerly dip-
I tinguifhed themselves, were calculated to

' we could remain unaffefted in a general
> wreck of the European establishments, or
I that we Ihould not immediately partake of
1 the evils resulting from the prostration of
I religion and morals which must inevitably
1 ensue. What then are we to think of those
politicians, who are laboring to keep alive
an enmity to Britain, who as well from the
respectability of her conftitutio* (the freedom
of which, contraffed with the democratic
tyranny of France, may at length ween the
minds of the discontented from their extrav
agant theories') as from her maritime supe
riority, is the only power capable of rescuing
the world from the ruin which menaces it!

while the other, as I stood at my own door,
iiruck me on tiw head with a bludgeon ;
Amazed atfuch baseness, and being affkulted
| wholly unawares, I turned into jsny Office to
. seize a stick, in (bad ofprelfmg mflai!-'
. ant, whereby I might have prompt!/puniffi
i ed his audacity. Reflecting on the trnnf
â , aCtion since, it has occurred to me, that I
f was fortunate in not doling with him, as his
, dagger-armed compan.on wqulJ immediately
1 have fallen upon >ne, and in the lcuffle which
, mult have enliied, I Ihould have ueeu mr.r

A woman came forward to lay he w**iiot at

He will not, however, pass unpunilhed :
But future attacks will be repelled i'n a differ

This day, at 12 O'clock, the House of Rtprt
sentatives of this state, waited on the Pre
sident of the United Siuies, and presented
the following
ADDRESS:
To JOHN ADAMS,
President cf theUxn-ED Status,
SIR,
AT this momentous crisis of our pub
lic affairs, the house of Representatives of
the State of Pennsylvania, at an early period
of their feflion, beg leave to cxprefs the high
lenfe they entertain of your conduct, as Chief
Magiltrate of the United States, in i'upport
ol the honor and independence of this coun
try.
We have viewed, with anxious solicitude,
the wild projects of dominion, which haye
beendilplayed on the theatre of Europe. We
have leen, that even that theatre is too small
forthe unlimited ambition of the rulers of
the French people;âthat the Atlantic itfelf
gives no bounds to their projects of subjuga
tion ; and that the United States of America
are threatened. Threatened, Sir, not lo
much with open hostilityâor an immediate
and bold divdion of their territory as with
a division, btfmeans of a dark and insidious
policy, of the people from the government of
their choice, and from the men on whom the
ponderous weight of adminifk ration rests.
The vilest arts of political ledudtion have
been triumphantly employed in various go
vernments, and especially in those of repub
lican form. The endearing language Of fil
ter has been uttered, in the moment of a
deadly embrace. That you, fir, have been
constantly aware of the effeCts of this policy,
and have, with an uniform dignity, provid
ed againlf thfcm and for the public fafety, so
far as yo::: conftitutiona] powers .permitted,
mult he highly gratifying to the patriotic
pride ol" every independent mind. That in
this address we speak the sentiments of the
great body of our conflituents, as well as
our own, warms our hearts in the expreflion
of ifaat important truth. Yet we deplore
that there are those, who call themselves by
the American name, who have daringly in
fuited our country, by an ul'urpation of pow
ers not delegated to them, by an obscure in
terference in our external That
you have lately noticed this circumfhnce, is
an additional proof cf your vigilance for the
jjneral welfare.
On this subjeCt itremainsforus to fay,that
is (not\vith.tanding your lioeral policy) ne
sociation Jus failed, we pledjje ourselves in a
solemn manner, as far as our conflitutional
powers extend, to co-bperate with the go
vernment in averting all foieign influence,
and detecting domestic intrigue.
With sincere and earned wiftie* for your
health ; that your care for the public good
may continue, and with it, the confidence
of t!-e citizens of the United States j the
House of Representatives of the State of
Pennsylvania have voted this Address.

I rel'urces, their brav.-ry, activity ingiruut;,
of i slid enterprise,. have fccen pecniiariy i'ubjeu,
e- . to paroxysms of this ciifkiiiper of tlie hum/.,
in mind. Iho ipirit of comjuei't, which hti
:i- I often fcizedon this peopL,lus liowever, tx
if j vcr taken pofleifiou 01 then: without making
at work for fevtre repentanceâwithout invoh
n, Â» n S France in extravagant exertions, and ex
re peaces, both of blood ard tic*Aire, which
it have ekhaufted it to t'uch a degree, as to re
quire i'omc times whole centuries of langour
and laiiitude before they could recover their
true ltation in the woild.
7 here has not been a found mind in France
'o which lias not always regretted and lamented
11, this foible in his countryman. Noi do 1 be.
r, lieve there is a Frenchman in the worid a;
: this day, v, ho is really and truly enlightensd
â¢d with the knowledge of the true Late reft and
:o honor of his country, who does not be*u i
i- the inl-tuHtion which is producing trnipo
i- rary calamities to other nations, and mull
produce more lading misfortunes to France.
1 The inJidiaus and malevolent policy of d.-
is viding p-opl- and nations from their govern
y ment is not original : The French have not
h the credit even oi the invention of it. It is
r- borrowed from the jjnrat nation of P-iKa,
i, who were taught it iy tfc little republic or
t. Sparta, ttter si e was debauched and coi rup.-
il ed. France Â«ught to I* rfliamedof it, aul
the world c.i'/lit to make her repen: tf her
: fctvile iniitstic*.
. C.frior nmfl own that our country lies
under a reproach which it concerns th: lu
ll tion to coiTctt : it is that of producing in
dividuals who are capable not only ofdirfc
interferences by ulurpation in our extern,.l
concerns, but alio capable or forgetting or
renouncing their principles, feelings and ha
bits, in a foreign country, ;:nd becoming en
d eini Â° s t0 their own. The diigmceful ol>fcr- :
vation has "been made, and with too much
appearance of truth, that there are more A
mericans than there arc of any other nation
who change their minds when they change
their ikies. Scandalous and criminal proofs
of this are heard and read almost every day.
i- Whether this is owing to a want, of national
Â»f chara&er, or a want of criminal law, a reiu
d edy ought to be fought,
i! Ihe solemn pledge you give to co operate
i with the general government, in averting all
t foreign influence and detrfling domestic io
~ trig'ie, is very important to the common
welfare of our cou> try, and will give great
:, fatikfadion to the Union.
e I return, gentlemen, with great pltafure,
e Â»y fineere and earned tvilhes for your
health, that yÂ«ur care for the public good
â¢ *may continue, as I doubt not it will, and

A CAUTION T0 THE PUBLIC.
JOHN A. SHAEFFER, ef Philadelphia, who has
for a few years past been in the southern States,
has had the effrontery to draw several Bills of Ex

a number of persons of their money, deceiving
them by an exhibition of letters and papers Wrth the
names affiled of divers public charaileis and repu
table merchants highly recommendatory of said
Shaeffer ; to one of th.-fe papers I find my name
fubferibed, but Ido not know the man ; these are
villainous forgeries! To prevent further imposition,
I have to requeli the of Ncwfpapers in the
United States topublifh this for the benefit of their

An Epic Poem,

K do not hesitate to declare our opiaion
that the poetical powers difplayei in it are of a
very superior kindâ Conceptions more lofty and
daring, sentiments more commanding, and lan
guage more energetic, will not easily be found :
nor doesfcarcely any part of it fink into languor,
at the glow of feelings and genius animates the
whoU. The language is, for the mod part, mo _
dolled on that of Milton ; and not unfrequeutly, it
has a ltrong rclifii of Shakespeare." .
