PHILADELPHIA,
WF.DNESD.AY EVENING, FEBRUARY Â»Â«.
7 he following memorial was communicated to
both houses of Congress, on Friday lajl, by
the President of the United States :
TO THE
CONGRESS of the UNITED STATES.
The memorial of the commissioners appointed by
virtue of an aft of congress, intituled " An
an for ejlablifbing the temporary and perma
nent feest of the government of the United
States,"ârefpeSfullyfbtweth,
THAT by virtue of the aft above men
tioned, and of an aft to amend the fame,
parted at Philadelphia, in 'the year one
thousand seven hundred and ninety-one, the
President of the United States hath caused
to be surveyed, and by proper metes and
bounds, defined and limited, a diftrift of
territory ten miles square, on both fides of
the Potomak river, including the towns of
Alexandria, in Virginia, and Georgetown,
in Maryland, for the permanent feat of the
government of the United States ; that the
proprietors of upwards of four thousand a
cres of land, within the diftrift aforefaid,
have conveyed the fame to trustees, for a
Federal City, tobe laid out with such streets,
squares, and lots, as the President of the
United Stares should approve ; the streets,
squares and parcels to be the property of
the United States solely, and the lots to be
eqaally divided between the grantors and
the United States ; the lots which, on a
divifiun, should be assigned to the United
States, to be fold under the direftion of the
President, for the time being, and the pro
duce of the sales to be applied, in the firft
place, to the payment, in money, to the
original proprietors, for all that part of the
land of each proprietor which should be laid
off in lots, squares or parcels, and appro
priated to the use of the United States as
aforefaid, at the rate of twenty-five pounds,
Maryland currency, per acre, not account
ing streets any part thereof; and the re
maining produce of the said sales tobe paid
over to the President of the United States,
for the time being, for the purpose of erec
ting the public buildings, agreeably to the
direftions of the aft of congress aforefaid.
That in the month of April, one thousand
seven hundred and ninety-one, the late Pre
sident direfted a- city to he laid ont, includ
ing the four thousand acres of land afore
faid, agreeably to. a plan which he caused
to ".!)< cog'ravtd ancl pu'blifhed. That he.
caused the two principal buildings required
by the said aft of. congress (those for "the
accommodation of congrtfs and of the Pre
sident) ,sb be commenced on plans which he
deemed proper for the rpurpofes intended,"
and correfpondeot to the liberality of the
grants which he had obtained. That, un
der his direftion, "sales of lots were from
time to time made, in the manner judged
most conducive to the objefts of govern
ment, and of those by whom the lands had
been granted ; but no sale deserving notice
t9ok place till December, 1793, when the
commissioners not only with a view to the
ereftion of the Federal buildings, but to
ensure convenient accommodations to the
members of congress, and others who will
follow the government to their permanent
feat, entered into a contrast with gentlemen
then in high credit, for the sale of fix thou
sand lots, averaging five thousand two hun
dred and fixty-five square feet, ta be feleft
ed by them throughout the city, under cer
tain reftriftions and exceptions, at the low
rate, in money, of eighty dollars per lot,
payable in seven equal annual instalments
without interest, the firft payment to be
made on the firft day of May then ne*t en
suing ; and for the further confederation that
the purchasers should build one hundred
and forty brick dwelling houfee, two (lo
ries high, each house covering ijoo square
feet, before the year 1800, and that all sales
made by them, previous to the iftof Janu
ary, 1796, should be on condition of buil
ding one such house for every three lots
fold, within four years from the time of
the purchase.
Yo'ur memorialists further (hew, that not
withstanding the favorable profpefts which
this tranfaftion for a time afforded, the
scene soon changed. The gentlemen allu
ded to not only failed in the punftual pay
ment of their iaftalmenc which became due
in May, 1795, but early in that year dis
continued the buildings which they had com
menced under their contrast. In confe
qnence, many mechanics and others left the
city in distress and discontented. Under
these circumstances, the late President did
not think it prudent to fell so large a por
tion of the public property as would be ne
cessary to raise the sums req.iifite for carry
ing on the buildings ; believing, on grounds
fufficienrly solid to authorise the declaration
of his opinion in a message to congress, ac
companying the meuioiial of the commis
sioners hereafter mentioned, that this pro
perty would be amply fufficient for the pur
pose, could it be reserved till after the re
moval of the feat of government, or till it
could be fold in small parcelsto such as would
porchafe for their own use ; he therefore
referred the fubjeft to congress, and sub
mitted to their determination the measures
to be pursued. This reference was made
by transmitting to congress a memorial from
the commissioners, slating the affairs of the
Federal Seat in as clear a light as circum
fiances would then admit, ;nd suggesting
the propriety of aulhorifing a loan, bot
tomed on the city property, and guaranteed
by congress, in cafe that property should
prove deficient. The ir.eafure was adopted,
and a bill pafftd, by more than three-fourths
of the members present in the two houses
of congress, to guarantee a loan to the a
mount of 306,000 dollars. At this time
your memorialists had expe&ations which
appeared to be well founded, that the mo
ney wanted wwuld lie obtained on loan in
Holland.; they loft 110 time-in endeavoring
to realize those eSmeftatipns, but the dif
trefles to which that country soon became
fubjeft, and under which it continues to la
bor, have rendered their efforts vain. Your
memorialiftt have, not confined their efforts
to HolTiniTj UuTTt isTVe'edlefs to detail fruit
lefs attempts. The ooly fuccef3 they have
met-with, /is a loan of 200,000 dollars in
United States stock, bearing a present in
terest of fix per cent, at par, of the state of
MarylanJ, which loan was authorised by
afts of the legislature of that state, in 1796
and 1797, and fanftifned by the late and
present President.
Your memorialists have the pleasure to
think that by the application of these sums
with what they have been able to draw from
other sources, tbe buildings under their care
have made a rapid progress, which their se
mi.-annual retnrns, made under-the aft of
Congrcfii, will ffeew. The late President,
in pursuance of the poliny adopted by Con
gress, direfted sales to be made by fin git. lots
or at molt by squares, on moderate terms,
to those who would improve. Your memo
rialists, pursuing this mode, have made but,
few sales, owing to the cheek given to all
entcrprize bythe depredations committed on
our commerce, and to the forced sales of
the property of debtors, which your memo
rialists, however reluctantly, have been o
bligcd to make, in eonfequrnee of the gen
eral failure in payment, by thepurchafers of
lots. Your memorialists are of opinion,
that the prices at which the lots have been
fold, will fully juftify the policy pursued in
the mode of felling; at the fame time, the
sales being so few, evinces, that this mode
will not afford the means of carrying on the
buildings, neither can thty depend on the
timely eolleftion of debts. Their refotirces
being thus exhausted, they, think it their
duty to represent thefecircumftances toCon
grefs, to enable them to judge of the mea
furesto be pursued, Yonrnaetjiorialifts con
ceive, that to expose the public property to
auAioa, would be not only inconsistent with
the views of government manifefted by the
aft authorizing a loan under the guarantee
of the United States, but ineffeiSual in its
operation; for although they cancur in the
opinion before mentioned of the late Prefix
dent, with rtfpe& to the value of the pub
lic property, yet it is otyriqus that the im
mediate sale thereof cannot be relied on.â
Provision must be made for the payment of
two hundred thoufdnd dollars, borrowed of
the State of Maryland, with interest there
on, and also the payment of thirteen thou
sand and ninety-one dollars andfifty-one cents
yet due to the original proprietors, before
any money arising from such sales can be ap
plied toward carrying on the public build
ing. Yotjr memorialists therefore conceive
it will be true policy in Congress to advance
the nteeflary films for that purpose, and to
cause the public property to be fold only as
advantageous offers occur. Should Con
gress pursue a contrary policy, they will, no
doubt, cause the public property, to be im
mediately fold; the near approach of the
time appointed for the removal of the feat of
government, will not admit of delay ; they
will dispose of- the money arising from the
sale, agreeably te the direftion of the above
mentioned afts of Congress ; a valuable pro
perty will be funk; the money will be ex
pended; the buildings will remain unfinifh
ed. Can Congress refufeto finifh them.?
The two principal buildings, now far ad
vanced, are oq plans approved by the late
President. They were carried on under his
direction, without any interference 011 the
part of Congress, until the session which
commenced in December, one thousand se
ven hundred and ninety-five; a committee
of the House as Representatives was then
appointed, confiding of nine members, who
were inftrufted to enquire whether any and
[ what alterations ought to be made in the
plans of the said buildings, and who report
ed, that no alteration could with propriety
be made therein. Whereupon Congress
passed an aft, authorising the commiflioners
under the contreul of the President of the
United States, to borrow three hundred
thousand dollars, under the guarantee of
Congress, for the purpose of completing
those buildings, and others required by the
said firft mentioned aft, and placed the exe
cution of the business under their own im
mediate infpeftion, by enafting, "that the
commiflioners (hall femi-annuallv render to
the Secretary of the Treasury, a particular
account of the receipts and expenditures of
all monies entrusted to them; and also, the
progress and state of the business and funds
under their administration ; and that the said
Secretary lay the fame before Congress, at
every session after the reecipt thereof;"'
which aft has been duly complied with on
the part of the Commiflioners. Under cir
cumstances like these, your memorialists can
not fuffer themselves to doubt that Congress
will make good the deficiency, Ihould any
happen, after all the money which could be
obtained under the firft mentioned aft of
Congress (hall have been obtained and ex
pended, agreeably to the direftions of that
a:*. It was with Â» reference to the faith
of Congress for the final result, that each
donation was made. No one donation, no
one donor, was fufficient to ensure the objeft.
The Statesand individualcitizens who grant
ed their money, left the application of it to
the general government, in full confidence
that thegovernment would cithercaftfebuild
ings to be erefted correspondent with the
grants, or if they chose to build in a more
expensive style, that they would furnifh the
meant of completing them. The aggregate
of those grants was judged fufficient to com
pleat the buildings on the plant that have
been approved, and it Hill believed to be so
if the property yet remaining be managed
with oeconomy. With a reference to the
fame faith, immense fumt have been expend
ed in purchafet and improvement! in the ci
ty, as well by citizens and fnbjefts of fo
reign nations, at by thufe of the United
State. But your memorialist will not en
i large on ft point, which they flatter them
\ selves no man will dispute; the only quefti
â¢ on 3 which they conceive can demand the at
: tention of Congress, will be, whether the
â  public property be worth preferring at the
â  expence of an advance of money fufficient
i to save it? And whether it will not be pru
dent, both in Â» political and cecoaomical
â  point ps yiew, to expedite the public build
i ings, by every meant in the power of gov
â¢ ernment to pursue ?
f The property ceded by the original proprie
tor! oftlie'eity of Waftington, and yet remain-
I ing unfo'd. consists ot' one thousand seven hun-
I dred and nine building lots, in choice squares,
from Which the purchasers of fix thousand lets
went excluded in their feleZlion ; of threethou
, sand eight hundred and ninety feet tront on
( navigable water, from wh'ch those gentlemen
were likewise excluded ; and of three thousand
four husdred and twenty eight building lots, in
other parts of the city. Your memorialists
wilhing to ascertain the value of (hit property,
can devise no better principle on which to deter
mine it, than by taking the ave age pi ice of lots
foldftncethe paflage ot' the guarantee bill, viz
three hundred and fifty eight dsllars, and ap
plying that fuin to the lots in the choice fqmres
above mentioned, which will amount to fix hun
dred and eleven thousand eight hundred and
twenty-tv o dollars ; the average price of water
property fold since the lame period, being sis
teen and a half dollars per foot front, applied
to the remainder of that property, will aino >nt
to sixty thousand two hundred and ninety-five
dollars ; and tbe loweit price at which anyone
lot has ever been fold lingly, viz. one hundred
and fif'y-two dollars, applied to the la(l defcrip
tioa of lot!., will amount to fiyc hundred and
twenty-one th lufand and Gxty-lix dollars, mak
ing in the whole one million, one hundred and
ninety three thousand one hundred and feventy
three dollars.
What the rife will be on the removal of the
feat of government, the experiment alone can
determine.
U fide the property above mentioned, the
ftims arising from sales already made, and now
dur, or to become due at diflerent periods
previous to the second day of Alay, one thousand
eight hundred, amount to two hundred and fe
venty-eiglit thousand one hundred and ninety
dollirs, ten cents.
By the estimate of a mailer builder, made
with a view of undertaking the executive offi
ces, the expenlie will be ninety-fix thousand
seven hundred and ninety two dollars. By
the estimates of the fupeiiijtendants of rhe pub
lic buildings, the expense of finilhing the north
wing of the capitol, and the jprefidfnt's house,
will be ninety-eight thousand five hundred and
forty five dollars. Thejudiciary is not includ
ed, because no plan has yet been under cpnfide
ration : add one hundred thousand dollars for
that objefl, and the whole will be two hundred
and ninety fire thousand three hundred and
thirty-fevcn dollars. After making every de
duction from the supposed value of the proper
ty which reason can juftify, no doubt can remain
of its fufliciency, under proper management, to
reimburse any funis the government may ad
vance. That it will be cecomomical to expedite
the buildings, is evident. The expense of the
commiflioners' office, and various other depart
me'rns, will be nearly the fame, whatever works
may be going on, or whatever progress may
be made therein. Policy requires that the
buildings ihould be in such a state *t the time
appointed for the removal of the government,
as to leave no doubt of the practicability of tbe
measure : even a debate on the fubjeA would
occasion uneasy sensations, as wall in congress as
among the citizens at large ; but ihould con
gress defe: mine against the measure, on account
of the buildings not being in readiness, it would
require very weighty reasons to juftify such a de.
termination, in the eyes of men who have plac
ed in the hands of the general government, se
ven hundred and feventy-fmir thousand, two
hundred ninety-fix dollars, and fifty-eight cents,
for the purp fe of preparing the place for the
reception. Tke grants of money by Virginia
and Maryland, and the property given up by
individual eitizens, and already fold, amount to
that ftim, exclusive of the property yet remain
ing unfold, of the value of which we have en
deavoured to give some idea. Is it not just, af
ter such advance* by states and individuals, that
the objefls (hould be accomplilhed ? And is it
not wile to prevent the difcontentj which a fail
ure of this measure would produce.' To con
gress, there ere, we look to insure its accom
plishment ; the monies received on loan will
not, with the ftii&eft ceconomy, be fufficient for
the purpose j the obtaining further loans is un
certain, and neither new sales nor halantes due
from former sales, can, with any fafety be de
pended on as refourcee for ready money, with
out which all operations must eeafe. Should,
however, fufficient be made, ar.y ap
propriations granted by congress, will remain
untouched. It is submitted, with great defer
ence, whether it would not be proper, under ex
isting circumftanees,. to authorise the President
to draw, from time to time, in cafe of necessity,
such sums as may be requisite to complete the
public buildings. The sums wllich will be
wanted are tno inconsiderable to be felt at the
treasury ; yet, small as they are, they will, in
the present state of things, greatly forward an
important national objeifl.
Your memoria-lifts have laid before congress

with full confidence, refpeflfully submit the
premises to your confidtration.

COMMUNICATIONS*
While the aftors on the Congress stage,
as Mr. Nicholat calls it, are performing, it
is prope? that they (hould not be led into a
mistake by believing that" we the people"
are as great fools as their addresses to the
gallery imply. We are not so little read
as to think with Mr. Baldwin, that our di
plomatic appointments are offiees to be cre
ated by the house of Representativesâ a bo
dy which feemt to be fonder of destroy tig
than building. The patriots there manage :
a pickaxe better than a trowel. The offi
ces of Miaifters, Residents, charges des af
faires, &c. are derived from the laws of na
tions, not from municipal laws. Let Mr.
Baldwin think well of that.
Mr. Gallatin, and some other bold afler
ters fay that history proves, the source of
the ruin of Republics is to be traced to the
accumulation of the grants of power to the
Executive ; or very nearly to that effeft.
Now Mr. Gallatin it challenged, upon
his fcholarlhip, to Ihew any such testimony
from history. On the contrary Republics
have been loft because fueh men as he,
claiming to be patriots, have democratised
them to death; âthey have vilified and wea
kened the Executive, until faftion became
strongest, and then right liberty and repub
licanism, heing the weaker, went by the
wall. This is exaftly the path our patriots
(con hi lion to them) are treading is.
Party divifiom in Congrefi threaten toJlop
the wheels as our government. It is for the
people to cure the evil by refefing to re-ele4t
the diforganizers.âThat is the conftiti-tion
al phyfiefor thediftemperof theprefentday.
Inllead of fending the noisy democrats to
south America (as the Directory have done
with much letter men) we hope the fauthcra
electors will fend theirs home.
The Philosophers de Pau, Buffon aHd
Raynal have contended that the animals of
America are inferior to those of Europe in
refpeft to size and ferocity. But the learsed
of Philadelphia, justly desirous that our
country Ihould not appear belittled in the
eyes of foreigner*, have lately made the
pleating and honorable discovery that the
Lyon of America is as great a brute as any
in the world.
When Hannibal besieged ancient Rome,
the Senate, to envince their firmnefs, fold
the very gound he was encamped uptn.
Had the Romans flinched andfniveled like
our Congress Jacobins, they would have
loft their country. The democratic heroes,
so valiant to atrack and divide pur own go
vernment,, lift up supplicating tnnds( no
weapon of felf defence in them)and cry to
almighty France, spare us. When little
Venice criespeecavi, it must be for want of
strength but for America, it must be want
of fpitit. Our forefathers were game cocks
in their native island have their progeny
degenerated and become capons ?

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Debate on a Repeal of the Stamp A3.
MONDAY, FEBRUARY 26^
The house having concurred in the vote
of the committee of the whole to disagree
to the report of tbe committee of ways
and means in their opinion as
pediency of repealing the law, and the sol- ',
lowing resolution being under considerati
on, viz.
" Resolved. that the committee of ways
and means be inftrufted to bring in 4 bill to
repeal the aft for laying a duty on stamped
vellum, parchment and paper."
Mr. Coit said, he had not vanity to
suppose that any thing which he could fay
could alter the vote which juftbeen ta-"
kea. He rather chose to call forth obser
vations from others. This aft had passed
last feflion by a conflderable majority ; and
he could not conceive any change that had'
taken place since that time, whieh should '
occasion this change in the opinion of the
house. There was no appearance in the
revenues of the country to authorize it.âv
It was true flight diflatisfaftions had appear-*
ed in some parts of the country, with this
law ; but these, he believed, were of little*
consequence. As he knew of no better
way of railing money than by a tax of this
kind, he was unwilling to part with it.
Mr. J. Williams said, when he gave his
vote for a stamp-tax, he did it to, avoid a di
rest tax ; but as he understood a land-tax
was still intended to be brought forward, he
ihould be for repealing the stamp-tax ; if he
did not, he believed they should have both â¢
a stamp-tax and a direst tax, which he by
no means withed.
Mr. Har ter wished the gentleman last
up had reserved his vote until'he saw that a
land-tax would be broHght forward. He had
not heard such a thing suggested this feflion
âit was generally believed that such a tat
would be unnecessary. The-.ftamp tax was
last feflion understood to be a substitute for
a land tax ; but if gentlemen now thought
a land tax would be preferable, they might
be afting confidently in voting for the pre
sent repeal. By a moderate degree of at
tention to the revenues of this country, it
would be seen, that with the aid of the pre
pofed duty on (lamps, every purpofeof gov
ernment would be answered, and thev would
be enabled to pay off the foreign debts, as
the instalments became due. But this could
not be done without the stamp-tax ; and if
this law were to be repealed, a land-tax must
be the consequence. Some gentlemen, he
knew, earnestly wilhed it; but those who
thought with him that a laud tax should on
ly be resorted to .in cafe of warâthat it
ought to be a dernier rcfort, that it must
always be very unequal, be attended with
great expence and difficulty, would certain
ly not be afting confidently to vote for this
repeal. If this country were to be enga
ged in war, other refourcej would be ne
cessary ; but whijft at peace, he would
pledge himfelf that our present resources,
with the stamp-tax, would not only be equal
to all the eurrent expenccs of government,
but also equal to the exiinguifhment of ev
ery debt of the country, and to the build
ing a navy by degrees, as circumftancee
should require ; but if this law was dispen
sed with, which it was supposed would pro
duce at least 2j0',000 dollars a year, we
should not be able to accomplish these ob
jefts, our funds will be found infufficient,
and resort must be had either to an encreafe
of our import duties, or to a land-tax.â
The question was betwixt a land-tax and a
stamp duty ; and he was willing for the
people of the United States to deter
mine who studied their convenience the
most, they who favored a (lamp tax,
or they who favored a land-tax. He
knew there were certain gentlemen in that
house who fcemed to make a direst tax an
article of their creed, as the Quakers make
the abolition of slavery an article of theirs.
He was willing they should abide the conse
quences of such a system ; he preferred the
stamp-tax- If gentlemen were not prepa
red to vote upon this question, until they fee
a statement of the revenue, ofcourfe tsdt
cifian had better be deferred ; but if theyarc ready lÂ« vote upai. it, ami to dilpefife vÂ»ha
with a revenue of from a lo 400,000 d<iU had
lars a year, it was more than he wished to
do. For the present, he believed, the (lamp Icqi
aft might be dispensed with ; but in the year as t
1801, there would be an additional sum of ry t
1,200,000 dollar* a year wanted, to meet was
the instalments of our foreign debt, which fori
mud be provided for. tion
Mr. S. Smith was glad to find that the the
oertleman from S. Carolina is now convin- blig
eed that the revenue of the United States con
is fully competend to meet all its expences. said
He believed the gentleman was much mi- he
ftaken when he spoke of the (lamp-duties as woi
being likely to produce 400,000 dollars ; of 1
he believed ico.coo was the extent of what row
could be expefted from that source. The din
house had been frequently told that the in- on -
ternal duties on spirits would produce 400, pro
000 dollars, whereas the lad return he bÂ«- pre
lieved, was 178,000. It was wrong thus tha
to deceive try unfounded estimations.â I The | boi
gentleman from S. Carolina, and others who j ry
Toted with him, had heretofore stated the to
impift duties at fire millions, bnt it now ho
appeared that those who had edimated them At
at upwards of fix millions, Were right in del
their calculation?. In 1796, they amounted ou
to nearly eight millions ; so that this differ- wh
cnce betwixt their calculation and the real In
amount wduld be fufficient to meet the de- thi
mauds which government would have to W
provide for in the year 1801. He had al- m<
ways been of opinion that the revenues of da
the United States would not decline, bÂ«it m<
go on increasing ; experience hadjuflified de
this opinion. Since the year 1796 addition- fai
alimpoft duties had been laid, and it was so
not yet known how much these would pro- th
dnce i but fie believed it. would be fufficir so
ent to enable government to meet the in- wi
ftalments of foreign debt as they became ril
due ; and if so, it would certainly be desira
ble to de away a tax which was odious to p<
the people in general, and would be oppref- *1
five to a certain deferiptioa of pet-sons in h;
the United States. When the damp law f> j
was patted, to prevent its being generally ll
offenfive, the- duties had been confined prin- Â«
cipally to instruments used by merchants. Cl
Upon the single article of a bill of lading h<
50 cents duty was laid, though in England n
it ways only 6 pence.âBelieving the pre
sent revenue to be fufficient for every pur- Â«*"
pose, he hoped the repeal would take place; P
indeed, the gentleman from S. Carolina be- d
licvedj with the stamp-tax, it would be d
efficient for every purpose, and equal to
the building of nayy-j-he moll allow, there- 0
fore, that it would be fufficient, if the navy h
was; left out the question. When the le- M
giflature determined upon building a navy, f<
he woulfl join that gentlemal in providing f
the mpans of effecting it; but, I'until that r
was done, hÂ« saw no necelfity for providing t
for that -objeft. D
Mr. Chamflim said he (liould vote in fa- 0
your of the repeal ; but he should not do it 1
from any popular odium which might be h
attached to the name of Stamp-Tax^âthis tax F
certainly bore no affinity to the Stamp, Tax
pfopcifed to be laid upon'tfcis country f
by Great Britain without our consent. It f
was not the Ux itfelf to which the people {
were at that time opposed, but tojtheprinci- )
pie upon which it was founded. In proof 1
of this, it Would be recollefted that a duty <
on tea met with the fame opposition. Mr. '
C. said he had not changed his opinion I
on this fttbjeft ;he voted against the bill '
jmpbfmg this tax in every stage of its '
pallage through that House. He did '
not know that a bill imposing a stamp duty 1
however framed (hould be opposed ; but the
present law would bear very hard upon the
merchants of the United States, who were
the insurers of our revenue. It was for this
reason, and not because it was a Stamp-Tax
that he was opposed to it. He found out
of sixteen or eighteen instruments' proposed
to be damped, thirteen of them particularly
applied to merchants, so that three-fourths
or four fifths of the whole duty to be col
lefted would be received from this source ;
and as he could not conceive that it was
the wilh of that house to oppress any par
ticular class of citizens, he trusted the law
would be repealed.
Mr. Craik did not rife to go into the me
rits of the Stamp aft, nor to charge the
gentleman from Rhode-Island with having
changed his opinion. Thefaft was, that a
a very considerable change had taken place
in the opinions of that house since lad fc(Ti
on ; nor had he heard of any thing which
could have induced the change, He fnppo
fed it arofc from a want of information.
The only good reason which he bad heard
for the repeal was, that our revenues were
fully equal to our expences. If this ground
could be supported, it would go to the re
jection of any tax whatever, and would be
a fufficient reason for repealing the law in
question; but before the house decided this
quediou, they ought to have better inform
ation before them than they had at present.
The committee of Ways and Means had not
yet reported a view of the revenue and the
expences to be met, he therefore, thought j
it would be proper to wait for this ftateraertt
for if it (hould turr. out that additional rev
enue is necessary, and that if the Stamp-A ft
be not carried into effeft, some other tax
mud be levied, it would alter the date of the
cafe. He, therefore, moved to podpone
the decision of this question until this day
three weeks, by which time the house would
have received all necessary information on
the fubjeft.
Mr. Tilunohast hoped the committee
of Ways and Means would be indrufted to
bring in a bill. If gentlemen wanted fur
ther information, they might in the mean
time obtain it, especially, as the bill, when
reported, might be made the order for a
dillant day.
Mr. Gallatin said, if the gentleman
who made the motion for podponement, had
had the information before him which was
before the house when the Stamp-aft pasTed,
he would not have made it; becauft it was
not in the power of the committee of Ways
and Means :o give any information beyond
what was befolre the house. If gentlemen i Â®
had attended to the flatefltents' which had 1
been laid before thect. they must be as well *
acquainted with the situation of the revenue j- am
as the committee of wayÂ» and means. Eve- mer
ry thing beyond these statements, he said,
was conjefture, and every member might ~
form his own. Being precluded by the mo
tion for podponement, from entering into
the merits of the quedion, he (hould be o
bliged to confine his remarks to a narrow t
compafi. The Stamp-Aft, Mr. Gallatin '1
said, was patted for five years; and for what I
he alked, was its produce appropriated? It j
would be well reeollefted that the President
of the United States was authorized tobor- -
row 800,000 dollars to defray the extraor- ,
dinary expences of the measures agreed up
on during the lummer ftffion. The amount
produced by the Stamp-Aft was solely ap-
propriated to the replacing of this loan; but tÂ£r
that loan had not been nnr could not be
borrowed, so that no provision was neceffa- an(
ry for the refunding of it, âWith refpeft
to the current revenue, Mr. G. said, the
house had full information before themâ
About 1,100,0*0 dollars of the principal
debt of the United States has been paid '
out of the current revenue, txclufively of
what has been paid but of the bank dock. Â£ cn
In December, 1797, the balance of cadi in t{j
the Treasury was about 1.900,000 dollars.
When the eommittee of ways and means
make th-ir report, they will make their
statement exaft, but this was as near the a- j
mount as was necessary to be ascertained, to
decide the present question. So that the q Â£
fame reason which inducedgentlemen to vote
for a damp aft lad year, might now induce
them to vote for its repeal. If the question
for podponement was loft, Mr. G. said, he an
would offer some observations upon the me- j.
rits of the main question. -j-
Mr. J. Williams hoped the motion for
1 podponement would be agreed to. He
thought it desirable that the house (hould j
1 have some information with refpeft to our ca
r situation with the powers of Europe, before
r this question was decided, as till that was
received, no one could edimate what expen-
ces might be necessary to be incurred. He
r hoped no extraordinary expences would be
i necessary; but it might be otherwise. If j.
. the fubjeft was podponed, other sources of
. revenue might come before them-. He ex-
â  pefted a report shortly on the fubjeft of
drawbacks. Last year the amount paid un- P
c der his head was 4,784,050 dollars: from
3 this, a handsome sum might be raised with-
. out having reconrfe to stamp-duties. He
y hoped the committee of ways and means
. would, in the mean time, report on the re
solution referred to them, relative to the
j system of direst taxes, and he trusted the j!
t report would be against it. If at the end of '
j three weeks this stamp-tax should appear un
neceflary, there cauld be no difference of e
opinion as to the propriety of a repeal of it. c
t If, however, more revenue was to be raised
e he would be in favour of a ftanap duty in '
x preference to a land tax.
x Mr. Sitgre aves was against the motion
y for podponement. The houfehadlatelyTjeen
t familiarized to calculations on the saving of
e expence, in order to prevent unnecessary de
bate. He thought the house was now runn- j
,f ing into a debate which could have no good
y snd.- It was well known that a proposition |
r _ originating in the fame quarter with this
(state of Rhode-Island) had been before the j
111 other branch of the Legislature, and had
ts been negatived by so large a majority as to
;<j make it unnecessary to spend much time '
â¢ y in debating [the fubjeft in that house.
[ A coll to order.'] Mr. S. did not wi(h

Bache's paper of this morning contains
c what he intends as a juftification of Israel's
party. Mr. Fcnno, it seems, took notiee of
IS the raw-head and bloody-bones, that the If
>f raelites sent gallopping about the Northern
d Liberties to scare the people from turning
out for Morgan. It was a fans-culotte 011
V horse-back, with this label on his cap, ' If
rael or Death.' Mr. Fchmo described this
monster as armed with a sword, whereas, it
ic appears (if Bache can be believed) to have
h beea a trumpet, which Surgo calls it an em
ie blem of peace. It is the firft time I ever
heard a trumpet called an emblem of peace ;
" and it is molt motiftroufly ridiculous that
[ such an emblem should, at any time be borne

d- But, it was not this filly apology of Young

bccomea extremely ufelul to those eiti*enÂ« of the

fetves to view this fubjea, underits various af

furnifted with the noceffary data, to judge of the

This work is principally diftinguilhed by the I
rlchnefnof the okfervation*, the pcrfpiauity of the I
Ucas, and the modesty of the theory which it i
contains. ' t Pars, a man of wit obftrved, that i
this work was like a rich farmer's barn.hoaped up
to the very roof with ufelul produce- It is addref- !
fad to the unfortunate La Favbttk, in letters, !
which fugitive the author who could only i
devote a few war ks to this occupation, was obliged i
to adopt. Although <ircumtianc<is are ill many I

ah&y were in the year 17 when these letters
were written, yet iAnay be jultly laid, that to ma

the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the ra

vince him that in ail tranfaetiotii, between free

Insurance Company of North America. \
bor Insurance against Fiat, on Dwelling-
Houses, Ware Houses, and other Buildings (and I
on Goods contained in such Building*) distant from
Philadelphia, in the United States.
!. Common lufurar.ee?, oÂ« hazards of the firft ]
class, will be undertaken at a premium of ahout '
half per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous '
rifqm's a larger premium will be required, which
will vai y according to cireumftances, feidom ex- i
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; but in some in
ftanees, where the property insured is not only in
itfelf extra hazardous, liut rendered dill more so i
by the vicinity of extra hazardous building* and
occupations, the premium demanded will be raised
according to cireumftances.
Honles and Ware-Houses, the walls and parti
tions of which are wheuly of stone or brick, well
eunftruAed, so aÂ« to guarded as well as may be
against fires from within, and Iree from extra ha
zardous buildings and occupations in their neigh
borhood, will be deemed of the firft
class, and may be insured to their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not ol an extra
hazardous kind, in calks, bales, or packagss, de
pofitcd in such buildings, to an amount not ex
celling 4000 dollars ; hat if more than thinfum
is required to be insured in one tenement, an addi
tional premium will be required, in proportion to
cireumftances.
11. lnfurances will also be made on buildings and
goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to tha risque. But it is not easy to arrange these
under particular heads or clafTes, so as to describe
, each with the neceflary accuracy. Each cafe must
therefore be decided upon according to the cireum
ftances attending it ; and thefa cireumftances wili,
ill general, appear from the description accompa
uying the application.
Buildings partly condruilcd of brick or stone,
arc preferable to those wholly wooder. And in
both cafej, the stile of building, how they are oc
cupied, how they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how occupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And withrefpeit togoods,
their tendency, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, cither
to commence or to increase an accidental fire, at 4
their liability in such state to receive damage t j
wet, or by sudden and hafly removal, or to be sto
len in time of confoGon and hurry, are all cir
eumftances of weight ; and the premiums must be
proportioned accordingly.
111. The following conditiont are to be tmder
flood by the parties .
ift. The Insurance is net binding till the ftiru
lated premium belaid ; hut it (ball be dtemed ef
fectual from the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the poiicy be immediately
signed or not.
3d. Infuriacec may be renewtd at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without fhrther ex
penses than the paymeÃt of the premium of the re
newed term, the cireumftances continuing the fame
as they were nnderftood by the Insurers at the time
the former irfurance was ma le ; hut the payment
â¢f tht premium ia eflential to such renewal ; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to clapfe after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during Jiich time ; nor can the insurance be renew

comm netment of the renewal from rhe expiration
of the former insurance. -The fubjtS of insur

I Marine InUliignctr 1" a work, for utility and el
tent of circulation, equal perhaps to any publica
tion of the kind in Europe or America, is now
induced to rifquean attempt to publilh a similar
paper under the patronage of the citizens of Phi
ladelphia He makes the attempt fiom a persua
sion that a publication for general benefit, and ez
tenfive information, will receive as much fupporC
from the liberal minds of the 1 merchants and othen*
of this city, ,as pi ces of less opulence in the Uni
ted Statesâand although little immediate benefit
should result to the citizens irom such a publica
tion, yet it might prevent an idea abroad which
Tome have industriously circulated, that the trade
of this eitenfir city was on the declinir, and con
traded into so narrow a sphere that it vrould not
support a Price Cnrrent,
The general anxiety that prevails in the com
mercial world at thi-, critical period, renders a
work of the kind particularly ufeful and' necessary
âNor can the utility be doubted, when it is con
sidered how extend ve the trad* and particularly
the insurance are affe&ed in this city.âA eareful
publication of the failing and arrival of velTels in
different parts of the worldâadvice from veflel*
at seaâaccidents happening in and out of port,â
are ever circumftanccs that ought to be known by
the merchant and underwriter, and one informa
tion of this kind may save mere than the colt of St
hundred papers through life. The Editor engag
es to use his utmofl endeavors to make it honora
ble and profitable to himfelf, sensible t hat it can
b< done only by making it acceptable to his patrons.
