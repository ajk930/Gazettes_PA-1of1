How fwlft are the labors of charity ! To | '
wipe the trickling tear from the cheek of for- 1
rowâto dissipate the anxious forebodings of
poverty âto (hut the door against the en- 1
tranca of want and hunger, nakedness and ?
coldâto/aifethe desponding, and to pour 5
oil and wine into the wounds which adverse '
events'have furrowed in the heartâthese 1
these O charity, are thy divine employments. {
It is an intimation of sacred writâ77><r f
poor ye have always with you. Seventeen !
hundred years have not impaired the truth
of the assertion. Though the times (hould 1
bÂ« prosperous arid plenty crown the exer- 1
t:ons of the husbandman, though the pro- 1
dusts of the field (hould be abundant, and '
peace and health prevail in our borders, '
stilT the avenues of misfortune are open and '
we find the poor even then with us. â¢
But, when pestilence (talks through the '
land, and the hands of industry are Hnnerv- '
edâwhen fear drives thp citizen from his '
wonted abode, and the fugitives from the ci- 1
ty multiply in the villagesâit is then that 1
the poor abound rfith usâlt is then that ;
the obje&s of clrarity and beneficence in- '
creafeâlt is then that the humane and be- 1
nevolent to whom heaven, with wealth, has
given the feeling heart, knovr " how bit (Ted 1
'tis to give,"
The late difffeffing scene which we have
witnefied, has unfolded the brightest traits
in the human character.
View the lift of fubferibers to the relief
of the diftrefTed, and let the piotis.beart ex
pand with gratitude that heaven has so ex
tensively impre(Ted its image on tfcc bofomi
of our citizens.
Let them not however be weary in well
doingâthere is yet room for the liberal
mind to devifr liberal things.
A frowning winter is impendingâthe
hands of many will be barely fuffieient for
themâMany loft their chief depen
dence in in the death of fathers, mothers,
brothers and bther near connexions. The
usual channels of support have been inter
rupted, or elofed forever. But to the re
flefling mind more will occur than can be
suggestedâSuch will not only chearfnlly
contribute to the relief of every objeft that
presents itfelf, but they will feck out the re
treats of poverty and wretchedness, and to
the utmost of their ability lefTen the calami

MR. FENNO,
AS you have favoured the public with a
final date of the polls at SulTex and Kent
counties ele&ions, with the Jacobin lamen
tation annexed, in your Gazette, No. 1590,
you will oblige a Federqlift by publi(hing
the following (late of the pol at New-Castle,
with the friend to governments' lamen
tation.
DEMOCRATS. FEDERALISTS.

What wss the reason that the Democrats
out-polled the Federalitls in New-Castle
county, where a considerable number of the
Electors, who make great profeffions of
their friendlhip to government reside ? Is
the Federal interest degenerating ? no. But
it is poflible that the piddling genius has
some influence (he having plsyed Quaker
1 some time pad) over the elders of that so
ciety that arc well disposed to government,
and kept them at home on the day of elec
tion, while he pu(hed forward their hickory
I sons, mostly Robefpemns in politics. A
tiother reason is afligned. Aliens were fuf
fered to vote and the number on a scrutiny
will be found considerable.
Again the election was held open spur
hours in tha night in violation of the elefti
, on law, which expressly fixes tlfe hour for
closing to fiÂ»o'clock in t{ie evening.
Yet a while and a day of retribution is at
hand. Certainly the reprefentativives of
Kent and Sussex will enquire how this adul
terated, felf-created, French crew, came to
* out-poll the Federalids.

TO MR. ALEXANDER POPE. b
sir, _ b
YOU are doubtless wondering at the no- 1 ft
velty. of un epistle from the remote (hores tl
vvliere this dates iÂ«S origin ; as well as from v
so obfeure a hand as that which fubferibes o
it.âBut what corner of the earth so secret, tl
as not to have heard the fame of Mr. Pope ? a
Or who so retired as riot to be acquainted v
, with his admirable compositions, or so stupid
as cot,to be ravished with them ? t
i Fame, after a man is dead, has been by d
( some ingenious writers, compared to an ap-
I plaufe in some distant region. If this be a t
, jyft similitude, you may take the pleasure t
of an admired name in America, and of a
spreading a tralTfport over the face of a new , 1
world : By wljich you may, in some measure, a
imagine the renown in which yoijr name will j 1
flourifh many ages to come, and anticipate a ; t
thousand years of futurity. I (
To let you fee a little of the reputation ! <
which you bear in these unknown climates, : <
and the improvements we are making, under , '
your aufpiciouinfluences, in the polite <. '
studies of the mflfes, 1 tranfrait to you tliCv 1
inclosed poems : Alluring myfelf, tho' not '
of the approbation of your judgment, yet of 1
the excuse and lenity of that candor which '
is forever inseparable from a great genius.
But notwithltanding all these reprefÂ«nta- ]
tions of your goadnefÂ», which my imagina- *
tion is able to form, I find it very difficult 1
to fupprtfs the struggle of pafiions which 1 1
swells my heart, while lam writing a let- 1
ter to so great a man. lam at once urged 1
by a generous ambition to be known to you ; I 1
and forbid by a trembling consciousness of ]
iinworthinefs and obfeurity. Prompted by j :
desire, slushed with hope, or appalled with |
concern, I add to the incorredlnefs which I
would now most of all wish to
short, fir, when I approach you, it is with
a real awe and ravelence like that whieh you
have so humourously described in the Guar
dian upon dedications.
How often have I been soothed and charm
ed with the ever blooming landscapes of your
Windsor Forest ? And how does my very
foult melt away, at the fpft complaint of
the languilhing Eloifa ? How frequently has
the Rape of the Lock commanded the vari
ous paffion3 of my mind : Provoked laugh
ter ; breathed 3 tranquility ; or inspired a
transport! And how often have I been
raised, and borne away by the irrefiftlefs fire
of the Iliad, as it glows in your immortal
translation !
Permit, me, fir, to conclude my letter
with asking the favor of a few lines from the
band tfhich has blest the world with such
divine produ&ions. If you thus honor me
assure yourfclf the joys you will produce in
me, will be inferior to none but the poetic
rapture of your own breast. Perhaps you
will be disposed to smile, when I confefs,
that I have a more superstitious ardour to
fee a word written by your pen, then ever
Tom Folio in the Tatler to fee a simile of
Virgil with that advantage.
1 am, fir,
, your great admirer,
and most obedient
humble servant,
MATHER BYLES.
LANCASTER, October 28.
On Wednesday last the Synod of Phila
delphia met in this boroughâTlje follow
' ing address is published at the request of
the reverend gentlemen :
To the ministers and to the congregations
' under the pastoral care of the Synod of
' Philadelphia.
' Brtlhrtn,
THE Synod considering the state of
religion in our laud in general, and the cir
cumstances of the church to which we be
long in particular, and viewing, in connec
) tion with these, the afpeft of the political
5 affairs of our country, and the affliflive dis
pensations of divine Providence toward a
> considerable portion of its inhabitants, have
3 been deeply affe&ed.
3 It is a notorious and lamentable truth,
3 that infidelity abounds, and is by many
7 profefTed without disguise or shame : that
J profanenefs in all its forms increases both in
1 malignity and degree ; that the providence
5 of God is dehied, aud his perfections difre
s garded ; and that the precious inftitutione
e of the gospel of Christ are openly reviled
e by many, and fiegle&ed by a still more qon
>f fiderable proportion of the people :âThat
s these impieties, as their certain and necef
t fary consequence, have given rife to im
is moralities of every description, highly in
r jurious, not only to the life of m, but
>- to the peace and happiness of focicty : In
!, our own church in particular, we have to
> lament with the deepest grief that vitil
y piety is declining ; that in many places the
l- external obfer.-ar.ee of gospel inilitutions,
f- and even the inclination to possess and lup
y port them, is relaxed; that the number of
those who seek the gospel ministry is small,
ir while the number of vacant congregations
i- is great, and increasing without the prof
>r pect of supply.
While such is our moral and religious
it state, we have just reason to expeft the
jf frowns of that Providence which
1- over all. We accordingly fee that the tide
to of tempora' prosperity, which we not long
since enjoyed, and which we have most un
gratefully abuied, i? ia some measure check
ed and turned :âOur commerce is inter
rupted, the fruits of the earth are diminish
ed, our manufadures are beginning to lan
guid), and even the peace of our country
t- is put in jeopardy : Infedtious and deadly
â¢.s diseases have visited even a large proportion
as of our most populous and opulent cities and
rs towns, and have fallen with peculiar violence
o- on the metropolis of this state and of the
is union, destroying many, and dispersing the
id most of its inhabitants, aud producing not
at only distress and grief among the poor and
u- those who have loft their dearest friends,
e T but a general and far felt calamity by the
:ie interruption which it has given to almost
in every kind of business and employment.
in these eircumftances who can rcfufe to
acknowledge that we are called to be hum
ble and to mourn ?âto be deeply humble fr
before our God, and to mourn with un- vt
' feigned penitence for those fins which are p:
the moral cause of all the affiittiofcs which j bi
we feel and fear ? To deny the obligations si
of this duty, and our peculiar call to it on
the *prefent occasion, would be but an ex- b
' ample and a proof of the depravity which
I we lament. d
I The Synod, therefore, have judged it o
to be their duty to recommend, and they h
â  do earnestly recommend accordingly, that
Thursday the 30th day of November nejft, /
1 be observed by nil the congregations under t
: their care, as a day of humiliation, fading jtl
f and prayer : That the people belonging to j t
r , our congregations do, on that day, lay |
, ' aside, as much as may be practicable, their c
1 ; worldly business and pursuits, and employ i t
! ' their time in seeking with union and with ' c
; earnestness, through the merits at?d inter- ' ti
) â  eefiion of the adorable Redeemer, the mcr- t
( 'cy of God in the forgivenefs of our fins g
r i both as individuals and as a nation ; that j
; the minitlers of the gofpt-1 do fpecfally di- ' p
f, re& the attention of their flocks on that [ c
t day to the duty of repentance and reforma- ' i
f tion, and enforce it by the powerful motives ,<5
' which are fnggefted by the gospel of our | f
, Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and by the j c
. peculiar circumstances in which we areplac- !
. ed; that they labour to impress on the t
t minds of the people the importance of feck- - c
[i, ing the favour and blefiing of heaven, as <
. the onlyjfource both of their temporal and f
[J ' eternal welfare that in the devotional ex- [ 1
. | ercifes of the day, both in public and in ]
f private, the most fervent supplications be i
y j addrefTed to the Father, of mercies, that the i
h -Holy Spirit may be poured oat for the re-
J vival of pure and undefiled religion in all
n the earth, and that a time of refrefhing may
fj come to this land in particular from the pre- -
n ftnee of the Lord ; that it would please 1
the Great Head of the cjiurch to raise up, <
qualify and fend forth into the gospel mi- '
1. niftry, many who (hall be-his able, faithful t
r and fuccefsful ambassadors; that he would 1
y make all our citizens sensible that righte- I
,f oufnefs exalteth a nation, and that fin is a '
is reproach to any . people ; that he would '
j. ble{# all that are in authority over us, give '
i_ them the spirit of their station, make them <
a a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them
n that do well: that he would preserve the
â¢ e peace, the honour, and the prosperity of
j] the United States ; that he would prosper
our agriculture, arts and commerce ; that
. r he would preserve the health of the iuhabi
,e tants of our land and fare them from pefti
h lential and deadly contagion ; that he would
le graciously the strokes of his holy
n hand to tholr who have lately and peculi
;c arly fuffered under it; that he would com
u fort those that mourn, provide for the poor
s> and neceflitous, and be the portion of the
:o widow and orphan ; in a word, that he
;r would confer his choicest bleflings on us by
jf turning us from our fins, disposing us to
righteousness, piety and benevolence, and
making us a holy and a happy people.
And we do also recommend, that while
we are thus humbling ourfdves in the divine
presence, and imploring the compassion and
blessing of heaven, a special attention be
likewise given to the duty of thanksgiving
for the many favours which are still conti
a- nued to us, and for the special instances of
ir. kindness and deliverance which, any parti
af cuhr place or people may have experience
from the merciful hand of God ; and this
is the rather as our exceeding ill-desert ren
af ders the reception and continuance of these
favours an instance of more peculiar gra<;e,
and enhances our obligations to
of and praise.
r- Trusting, brethren, that you will give a
e- cheerful attention to the important duty
c- which we have now recommended, the Sy
al nod conclude with most devoutly praying,
If. that the Author of every good anffperfett
a gift may co,nfer his rieheft blessing, on you,
i-e and with commending you to his holy keep
ing and care,

ins The privateer come in from the eastward ;
of- and, fortunately mistaking the Fox, which
lay anchor in the roads, for a merchantman,
>us he ran in without apprehenlion ; but on
.he coming fufficiently near, to discover his mif

ide immediately weighed and stood out, and af

prizes, were reduced to sixty men. She has
to been sent to Madras for condemnation.
t
On Tuesday arrived in die river the Fox
| frigate, with her prize, the Modefte. These
j vessels remain at Kedgeree, where stock and
j provision of every kind, with water, have

supply.
Several very fine Englifti horses are bro't
by the Abercromby.
Tire above horses were landed on Thurs
day morning and appear to be in excellent
order, coufidering the length of time they
have been on board.
By letters from Madras, we learn that
Admiral Rainier had ordered the Arrogant
to join him at that port. The accounts fur
ther state, that the admiral had sent for the
two navy transports, Echo and Latona.
By letters from Lucknow, of the 4th
' curt, we are informed that the ceremony of
i the exchange of the hat and turban had been
I observed between the right hon. the gover
i nor general and his highness the vizier, in
testimony of the moil (incere friendlhip and
good will between the parties.
! The vizier continues to observe the most'
; profound refpeÂ£t and attention to the govern
or ; and from the favorable disposition man
ifefted by his highnefit, our eorrefpondent iff
decidedly of opinion that any arrangements
for the public good, will meet with a ready
concurrence on the part of his hignefs.
Our letters from Lucknow also? mention
I that the Nawaub Vizier had direfted boats
- of different conftruftions to be transported
j on hackeries to the banks of the Ganges,

BOMBAY, February jj.
On the morning of Monday laÂ£l, the Shah
Ardafeer, captain Dawfon, anchored in (he
harbour from China, after touching at Ma
dras, and upon the Malabar coafl. This
(hip is the lall of our China fleet ; and if
the precarious chara&er of the Canton mar
ket would allow us to fpeewjate upon the
tenor of her accounts, we should argue fa
vorably of the ensuing season, for fmce our
. last advices the price of cotton had risen ;
but it is a quetlion of mnch doubt whether
cireumftances will concur to uphold the
1 price.
The Ardefeer left Canton on the 3d of
F December, at which time the retail jyi of
- cotton was so high as 16 tales the ptfcul.
Such however is the ignorance we are tfon
. (trained to profefs with regard to every thing
. that relates to China history, that in treat-

Extraft of a letter, dated Head-Quarters,
Coodiangurry, 2d February, 1797. . (-1
" I baflen to communicate to you the fur
ther operations of the little army under Ma
jor Andcrfon ; the day after I sent you off
my lafl letter we marched from Coodiangur
ry, to a place called Monandeny ; in our
march we were rather unexpeftedly, very
ivarrnly leceived by a party of the Rajah's
people, who were lying in ambush in the
jungle waiting our approach, they saluted
up with a vfery brisk fire of mufquelry, which
we soon returned, at leafl two fold. The
firing commenced firfl in the front of our
line, as we wtte then, in consequence of
Angle Pies, in less than or.e minute the fire
had extended quite to the left, when we
fronted, and fired about twelve rounds by
grtmd riivifionn, which quickly checked the
enemy's impetuosity ; however, they con-
to keep a brisk but irregular fire,
Â«nd thiw they continued to difput* the way
tfith us, for near five milee, the objeft of
our destination be'ng a Mud Fort belonging
to the etjemy. The European grenadiers
the commencement of the aftion were or
dered in front, tupported by fix companies
ofnative grenadiers, who diilinguiflsed thsm
felves in a very gallant manner, advancing
and firing alternately from about nine o'clock
In the morning until pdfl one, when the
whole drew up in front of the Fort, and
tihr field pieces were brought up to play on
their wooden towers, from which they con
tinued for fomÂ« time to shower vollies of
mufquetry, and defended themfelvcs with
infinite spirit and gallantry until about four
in the afternoon : we were now only wait
ing fertile arrival of the scaling ladders to
storm the place, but here we \tere unfor
tunately disappointed, as the Coolies who
â¢were bringing them up, alarmed for their
own faFrty threw them down, and run like
brave fellpwe, convinced of the juflnefs of
Hudibras's observation
He that fights and runs away,
May live to fight another day.
About half pafl four, the grenadiers ex
preffwg much impatience for the attack,
they were ordered to ho'.d themselves in rea
diness at a minutes warning, they were ac
cordingly ordered to the attack, when they
marched with theutiuoft alacrity, despising
all kind of fatigue or dangers through a
paddy field knee deep in mud, where the
lofk in shoes was very considerable, mofl of
them being left behind, in the paddy field,
â when the e : nemy perceiving the rapidity of
their movements,they immediately a'bandon
*d the fort, firtl setting it on fire, and our
troops futon got poffeflion of it. âOur loss
giv this occalion has not been so grtat as
might have been expefted, considering the
aukwardnefs of our situation, when firfl at
tacked, I believe the following to be a pret
ty exaft detail about 84 killed and wounded
ten of which are Europeans, viz. t ferjeant,
âI corpor;il and I private killed, and I cor
poral and fix privates wounded, chiefly of
ihf grenadiers, during the following day, a
continual fire was kept,Up by both parties,
but with very little loss on our fide.
On ihÂ« 27th a party confifling of one
hundred and fifty men, were dilpatched for
the fiuydy of ammunition, as they marched
in the night they reached their deflir.ation
without any accident or hindrance from the
enemy, but on tneir return next day, they
fell iu with and were attacked by a strong
party <if the enemy, a reinforcement of one
hundred meit were difpa.ched to their affif
Â»aÂ«ce and they unfortunately made their
way good jo the camp with the whole of the
ammunition with the loss of thirty men
.killed and wounded. As Jar ais we have
been able to learn, the enemy has Io(loi;e i
hundred and eighty-!!:; killed and two hun- 1
dred and lif.y feveti wounded and oae of â 
their principal commanders. ) ]
On the 30th a meffiige was sent in, that 1
the Rajah was ready to subscribe to wbate- j
ver terms the commiflioners might prescribe, [ ]
! fending in hoflages for the due performance j 1
!of the Agreement; in consequence of whicji J

Letters were yejlerday received from Tran

of a vessel from the Mauritius, (the Triton) 1

the arrival of agents from the republic, to avenge 1

That the Britifhfquadron had left their fta

Brul Gucle Corvette, returned from a cruize 1
' off the coajl of Africa, and anchored in the har

That captain Lofaci, proceeding from the

opened a heavy fire on the British Jhips, and
which was as warmly returned

ic Sir H. B. Hayes, for the apprehension
t- of whom a reward <?f 2001. was offered by
t- government, for forcibly running away with
:d Miss Pike of Cork, is taken, and in con
t, flnemcnt. We are favoured with the fol
r- lowing particular account of that desperate
of aft : âA letter was sent to the young lady
A at a late hour iÂ« the night, acquainting her
s, that a particular friend of her's was fud
' denly taken ill, and (hewed strong fymp
,e toms of death ; and that if even file set
or out upon the receipt of the letter to fee
this person, it was likely, if very great
3n hade was not made, that death would take
le place before she, Miss Pike, could arrive.
;y The latter immediately ordered her car
ig riagc, after reading the letter, and set out
ne to take a lafl farewell, as /he imagined, of
if- her friend ; on her way, at a place near
;ir Glanmire, about two o'clock in the morn
he ; ing, the carriage was beset by five persons,
en ! one of whom wa* Sir Henry, and carried
ve ! off in triumph to the knight's refider.ee at
Mount Vernott. A ferjiak was put into
the carriage by the party, with Miss Pike,
whofc biinnefs was to soothe the young
lady, and prevent fear from preying fcvere- i
ly upon her. ]
When arrived" at Vernon Mount, Mif6 j '
Pike was eondufted into the house, and in- <
troduced into a room, where a person, al- ;
lodged to be a clergyman, was prepared for* 1 <
performing a marriage cerrmony, in which i
(he was intreated to give her confer,t to fir ]
H. but (he resolutely refuting, he pulled >
out a pistol, and threatened to I
felf if (he did not comply. Although (he |
dill perfiftcd in her refinance, a marriage j t
scrcmony was forced upon her, and (he was < t
obliged to receive a ring, which fts food a* '<â 
(he recovered the life of her hands, (he con- j:
temptuoufly threw away. Sir H. compel- j:
led her to follow him into a tÂ»om, where, ' i
having tried in vain for some time every'art i
to induce her to favour his designs, he left i
her confined. ;(
She wag soon after released by a near re- i
lative of the knight, v/ho told the young la- i
dy (he was not to be confined, and if (lie i
would but be fatisfied, and comply with the
intreaties that had been made to her, she
might command the house and every person
in it. The lady's friends, who had been
apprised of this extraordinary adventure, by
this time had reached Vernoa Mount, and
rescued her from the party.
Sir H. B. Hayes is the son of a brewer
at Cork. He is about 35 years old, and

A gentleman who came pafTenger in th e
stage from New-York, states, that, on hi 3
leaving New-York, a refpeftable merchant
of that city informed him, that the Septem
ber packet had arrived at Halifax, and
had brought intelligence of Peace between
England and France.
An arrival at the Southward from Bour
"dcaux, is reported to corroborate the forego
ing information.
The desirable and momentous event of a
' general Peace, tho' left a matter of doubt
by any intelligence hitherto received, will,
in all probability, preclude another cam
paign.
But evils of the moll grievous nature may
still beset this country, (hould the pirates of
the Weft-Indies be fuffered to continue their
lawless depredations on our commerce.
This eonfideration urges in forcible lan
guage the propriety of immediately equip
ping ourJlttle marine.
MetTrs. Girard, Lownrs, and Connelly,

from the favorable fituatioji of the Hospi
tal, to resign their fuuftions, and in future,
to discontinue their daily vifitsto that place.

reported, that not one death occurred in all
that city Fell's Point included, during the

The prefeot I conceive is the most proper

pafled,_you ar-; presented with nn opportu.
nity for the exercise of your benevolence by
furnifhing the means of employing them ;
which I propose (hould be by completing
the canal from Delaware to Schuylkill, and
thereby watering the city ; beside the great
atcommodation this will-give to its inhabit
ants, it will be the best means of cleanfin
and watering the streets, and will lessen the
means of fprÂ«ading the contagion (hould we
"unfortunately be again visited "with that
worftof scourges the Weft-India or yellow

sal, which I hope some more able hand will
consider of and Improve on, to give employ
to many huwdreds who rnuft be maintained
the ensuing winter, either by finding .them
employ or by your charity without it.â
Let persons in each ward be appointed to
solicit fti'ofcriptions either in money or, by
becoming security for a certain sum to be
borrowed of the banks, to be repaid out of
the firft monies received from the canal, or
by a tiumber joining in a company to pur
chase (hares of the canal stack where a (hare
is more than one per(on would incline to
rifle. This mode if generally qdopted would
not only afford you the fatisfa&ion of re

peft of averting the fpfeading a like calami

AI.L that haror may be fair! in favor of the
Role d'F.quipan;e, and on the policy or propriety of
our velTels being furnifhed therewith, will be of
little moment; for, condemn our vefTels to get
plunder our dtar alius arc detemfined to do at all c -
vent". V'c have not one single inftanec of a ves
sels' being liberated which provided with this
important and nrwly discovered proof of the neutrali
ty of property. On the contrary, the tribunals e
â ven in France, would not be baffled in their preda
tory views were we to load our velTels with evi
dences of their neutrality. I am informed our
custom house has lately undertaken to require of
veflels this said paper before a clearance can be ob
tained : how far the officers to whom the manage
ment of that department is eatrufted, are warrant
ed in this flep, I will not presume to determine ;
but it is much to be questioned, Whether our gov
ernment has authorised, and will not condemn a
measure so impolitic and dangerous to the hopes
and mterefts of our merchants and underwriters.
As peace is so near at hand, would it not be ad
vifeable to avoid all measures which may tend to
invalidate our claims for the 15 millions, of which
a large majority of the French nation fay we have
been unjustly stripped ? The general poverty and
misery among the French, owing to the total def
trudlion of manufactures and commerce, has pro
duced a spirit of privateering or rather plunder
ing, which pervades every part of France and her
dominions ; and all the papers we can paffibly fur- I
ni(h our velTels with, will not save one in an hun
dred more than haÂ« hitherto escaped the fangs of
those robbers of the world. Pea c being not far

enable uÂ« to recover what is 1011, than to debar
