v â  "Tp the Electors of the City of Philadelphia.
" Fellow-citizens,
" YOU will be called on in a,few weeks to ersr
r..: the grejiteft right which independent cftizems
\ in tbe chooGng of men to represent you
the Hoofe of Congress of the United States
. 'i tin* Legislature of Pennsylvania.
" 1? becomes you therefore to reflect calmly and
.!:i)cr?.tcly on the you are about to perform,
(-( r.lcer well tile ch3ra6ler of the different candi
. if,? who" arc proposed to you for your fuffrage :
>J you find them men who buoyed up by then
vrcalih consider themselves superior to the common
rnafs of the people, if you find them men who
"C'C inimical to our secession from Great-Britain,
it you find th-m men who in those v tiraeÂ£ that
tr;ed men's fouls" shrunk from danger, you will
appreciate their merits by the standard of their cha
â  rafters.
" At this time when an ariftocraticsl influence is
daily pervading every corner of the United States,
when a combination of old torits, Biiiilh agents
and speculators, pretend to dictate laws to you, it
becomes you as citizens of a free Republic to en
deavor eocrulh them.
" Think not that I exaggerate, every ,one who
â will but reflect on the conduct of a certain party
among us for some time past, will find that it is
but too true.
" The"doctrines these people hold up are that the

In your papei of Sept. the 7th, I observe wjiat â¢
you call a particular and authentic account of the 1
' melancholy event which happened at Bath on Mon- i
day the 29th ultimo ; but I must obfei-re your in- ;

circumstances are thus : 1

Randolph of Virginia, and Mr. Elifha Jarrett. of c
Maryland. After their retiring from the billiard a
] ie room > Mr. Jarrett conceived himfelf injured, which ii
induced him to demand fatisfaftion of Capt. R?n- t
dolph, requcfting by a note to meet him, which note
ur Capt. George 'Fliomas was the biarcr of, but Ran
dolph refufed, faying he knew no such charaiSer ;
a P' a ' n 1 made no reply, but went imnicdi
n(i to Jarrett and informed him of Randolph's' ai
aefwerâthen Jarrett procured certificates from gen- ri
ne t ' smen veracity fcewing him to be upon an equa- o
lity with Randolph or any other man ; which cer- o
tificates Capt. Thomas was also the bearer of p
Randolph flill refufed to give fatisfa&ion for the in- h
fult he ( had given Jarretâthen came up Captain fr
Blackburn and told Thomas that Randolph fliould ol
fee Jarret 111 the morning, faying that he was Ran- le
dolph's friend, and would represent him ; Captain lii
1 homas said he was fatisfied, then Blackburn reti
red to his company - r and after some ti<ne a Mr* W
Meicer and Capt. I homas began to quarrel, after aj
some warm words passing between them, Mercer qi
went and brought Blatkbum back again, then fays T
Blackburn where is the dân'd rascal who wifties ec
to disturb any of my company, and said to Tho- â *,
mas, I thought I had given you fatisfa&ion on that w
bufmefs beforeâThomas replied he did not wish to ca
quarrel or have any dispute with him, then Black- on
burn told him he was a dân'd rascal, and Thomas w;
rep â¢â¢ dhe was adân'd liar ; Blackburn then drew th
out his dagger and dabbed him,'-of which he expi
red in a tew moments. Blackburn then made his at
efeape for that night, but was followed and taken th
day at Williamfport, and sent to Martins- ag
burg jail, and on Tuesday the 6th inft. came on his m;
trul before a special court, where he was adjudged 3c
for farther trial, at the diftridl court to be held at. T

mould not have troubled you farther than dating T
the fa&s, had not some cowardly and patti'al friends so
to the aggressing party, by publishing lies and mif
tating fads, attempted to lefTen the ehara&er of
ihe aeceafed man and Jarrett ; but whenever such so:
circumstances happen as were in this dispute, it must
of necessity create infinite mifchiefs and disorders
in society, good men will be injuriously treated,
while the bad are applauded and carefled. Nay, so
far may the public be deluded by falfe and partial
reprefentauoos, that the best and most deserving of
men mav be pursued with the most cruel hatred and
made tofufferthe greatest wrongs, while the worth
less and overbearing, (hall be advanced toTalfe dig
mty and hoKor. It is well known by all who were ag
perfona.ly acquainted with Capt. that his he
character stood fe.r and Hnblemifhedâhe was a man tui
who made his Jiving by hdneft industry and applies- for
tton-no gambler ; nor could he be considered a
dissipated charaaer â¦ neither can any man brW for- for
ward any charge against Jarrett more than is com- pli
| mon among young men, rather imprudent ; but the
mod contemptible and falfe propagations have been
attempted to traduce the character of both Thomas
and Jarrett. Some cowardly and pa. tial writer set
forth m this, and the Winchester paper, the most
palpable lies, faying that in two or three days after
the quarrel, Capt. Thomas.was boasting he had
frightened some of the continentals, whewfrom the,
beginning of the dispute till his death did not ex

, r " Gentlemen, it is ifcipofiible to thank you fuffi
ciently for the honour you have done me. It wj#
very much unexpected by me, because I unJerflood
that the Stewards would carefully avoid the menti
on of any mail's r.ame in this company. We irxt
y for printiplrs, without the mod distant peffouat
idea of any man or any party ; but certainly with
out injury to the principles which we ait hold, I
except, however, your kind;:efs, and'thank you for
the health you have given to the principle. It is
totally unneceflary for me to fay one word on the s
approbation of that principle to a company like '
this, but perhaps it may not be uimeccffary to fay t
word or two for our own comfort. Gentlemen,
the reign of corruption, yot; may be a/lured, is co
ming towards its close. I ougJit to tell you 0.1
what I found that opinion. I will do it a# ihortly
as lean. A very little knowledge of our hiilory
will fiiew that those Ministers, who principally di

on that attempt to gaverniy terror. A Jitt'iemoic

themselves murdered !or the murders 1 i;ry had

ftherae fuceeeded, and those who defircd to be ah
folute ill this country, not daring to begin with
fear, followed up fheir dufires with the eoiltfe and
the plan of corruption. That corruption is drain
ed almost to the dregs, and you have but little now
to fear. In the course of the American war, Lord
Worth pursued the plait of corruption, and lie did
, lt fÂ° 'Â°"gÂ» that Mr. Pitt found but little remaining
to corrupt vvitli, because all he could lÂ«Ty hÂ«k\ of

therefore peed not wonder that Mr. Pitr, thus litu

if Mr. Fox continued an enemy to reform he would " e y
