February rod 4}CO AG# ESS of rrs UNITED STATES. P
. HOU-SE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Thursday, January 19. w
ThcHoirfe being in a cercmittee of the whole on ''
the subject of further revenue, Mr. Dent in the
chair*
A call for the question was made. n
Mr. Gallatin said, before the qnetliÂ«n was taken, si
hawonld state, that the amendment proposed would si
be a total defeat of the resolution for laying a direÂ£t t
tax. The gentlemen from Colme&icut, he said, t
bad been accultomed, iu laying their Hate taxes, to v
valuations of property made'betwixt different v
tpwns, and thÂ«y supposed no delay wduld be occa c
fioned by the propolition before them ; but it wufl (
be rerolleited that in apportioning the tax amongst
the dates, there was no occafion.for fcch a t
valuation as they canteciplated. It was proposed 1
by the secretary of the treasury to "be done by means 1
of commissioners instead of the iegiflature, and he 1
believed that would be the belt way. If the refolu t
tion was, therefore, agreed to, the mizht be I
proceeded with j but if the amendment was passed, 1
and a new census was to b e taken, they must wait 1
at least two years, and 110 valuation could take 1
plaee until a Congress was eledted according to the
new census, which could not be done till the time
ofthe Congress jutt chosen expired. They tfiight,
indeed, have an enumeration taken and a tax afleff
ed, on the 4th of March 1799, which would be the
day on which the powers of the new Congress would
-commence ; but no ta:; could take place in the
mean time.
There was not the Jeaft doubt, therefore, tbat
if the amendment'paffed, it would amount to a de
feat of a diredt tax for two yeats. The question
was; then, whether they would agree, or net, so to
.put off the business.
Mr. G. said, he (hould have no to the
taking of a new census before the expiration of ten
years, if it was thought to be neteffary; but he
could not think of doing it before the proposed tax
went into effeÂ£t.
Mr. Dayton did not Bgi'ee with the gentleman
from Conneftieut (Mr. Smith) who had asserted
that the words in the original resolution and in the
amendment would have precisely the fame opera
tion, and really meant nothing. He believed that
they would operate, and were intended, to decide
the question against a new census, which the mem
bers from Connecticut., as well as from New-Jersey,
must be equally defirous.of providing for. The
chairman of the committee who reported the reso
lution under debate, had candidly acknowledged it
to be his objsdt and meaning, and other members
had given a like conftruftion to the words. Some
notice was due to the remarks of the gentlemen
from Virginia and Pennsylvania, who, though not
-entirely agreeing irr their conflruftions of the con
stitution, had broached dofilrines that were new,
and not at all warranted by that The
Â£ud that if a new ceufus should be taken
turned at the firft meeting of the next Con
greis, ana d direct tsx ror tfre corrtnt ymr thouio
be apportioned by then: in the fame *fe(Tion, they
must take for the rule of apportionment the old and
not the new census, until the representatives had
been regulated, and taken faats under the last enu
meration. Could it be poflible, Mr. Dayton aflced,
that any man who had read these words, " iKrcS
taxps JhaU ie apportioned among the feneral jlates
according to their rtfpecliuc numbers" could believe
that injunction obeyed, if the enumeration, last,
taken, and immediately before their eyes, should be
i-ejefted qr difiegarded, and one taken eight or ten
years previously adopted, in preference, as the rule;
ef numbers and wealth. The gentleman from Penn
sylvania had not carried bis doctrine quite so far,
but had given, as his opinion, that the return of a
new enumeration to the next session would prohibit
an apportionment of any direct tax in less than twp
years, wlieii a new reprefentat-ion would take ef
feÂ£t. The tendency of such a dodtrine would be
highly dangerous, as it would lock np for two years
the only resources of government, and it might be
in time of war when they would most need them,
l Â»nd have *0 other to resort to. Both those gen
tlemen fecmed to have conceived and afTumed for
fa6t that dircft taxes were to be apportioned ac
cording to representation, in which they were not
justified bjf the constitution. Representation and
direst taxation were both, it was true, to be adjufl
ed by onecommon ftandaid, but not by
and although in theory, of at firft view, the dif
tinftion was not linking, yet in practice it would
to he material and important.
The question upon the amendment was put and
-mgatived, there being -only 19 in favor of it.
The question was about to be put -upon the ori
gisal resolution, when
Mr. Havens wished thequeftior. to be divided.
Mr. Potter said, he was against the resolution,
becsnfe the tax would fall very unequally.- Since
the last census was taken, the situation Â®f rr.any of
the states was very much altered as to population.
In the state o.' Rhode-Island, vrhich was already
cpprefTed by,the direst taxes of the state, many of
the inhabitants had removed into fiateiof New-
\oik, where they had less taxes to pay. The state
of New-York and others, he said, had increased in
population, and therefore a direst tax would operate
'verv unequally on different states.
By the report of the secretary of the treasury, it
appeared, that thr-ftareof Rhode-Iftshfrwss top*y
â¢?JJ,ooo (totfars a year, which would operate as a
tax of double the sum on their land-holders, from
the manner in which it would be collcdted, and
from other property being excused from fuppoiting
its fharÂ« of it. It wrÂ»ulu therefore fall particu'aily
heavy on that slate, when compared with others.
It had been faiii by the gentleman fron) Pennsyl
vania (Mr. Swanwiek) in two long fpeeciirj on the
fubjedt, that a was the molt certain and
easy in collection, the-fii ft convinced him that he
knew nothing of the opprefllon of a tax
That gentleman was agaitft having the fyltem de
tailed, because it would be the means of raising ob
jections to it ; but after gentlemen had voted for
the abttraft principle they must vote for the bilk
ttlu P. believed fuiEcicm revenue might be raised
from {ti&rcA taxes. An additional tax had be ;" |f<
pn f led on fall and brown sugar. i: w*3 laid "
thtl'e were article* consumed by the poorer clafTes ;
but if a man purchased fait or sugar, he waÂ« pleased P
wi'k the purchase, and would pay double the tax in "
in this way, that hp would pay by a dire&.tax. 1
Nay, he believed a man felt five dollars paid in a v
diti.it way, more than 15 or 20 paid indire<Â£lly. v
if, he said, they were to tiy to raise Uy irÂ»dire6t il
mea"?, on the plan recommended by the gentlsm-"' '
from South Carolina (Mr. Harper) a part of the h
sum wanted till next fefiion, it would be seen whether
that method would not be fusrcfsfal. If it was v
then found, that the revenues arising from thence
were inefficient, there was not a person in the bouse t
who would enter into direift taxes with more rea- Â«
dinefs ; bat, until all indirect m?anÂ» were tried, he t
should be unwilling to go todireft taxes.
Mr. Swanwickfaid, he was sorry that the gen- 1
tleman from Rhode-lfland (Mi. Putter) should t
have supposed, l.edid not undeiltanJ the principle t
of dired taxation, from not having felt it. Hebe- (
lieved, it had been mentioned by his colleagues, J
that a dired tax had long been colle&ed in this t
state â ; so that he had been constantly in the habit
of feeling the weight of direct taxes, as he believed j
there were few places which paid mare in this way. 1
than Philadelphia. If the gentleman had been in j
possession of landed property here, he would have :
felt the truth of this. 1
Much, Mr. S. observed, had been said on the
fubjeclof indirect taxes, and of the poor being in a
great degree exempt from them. He believed this
was not true. The duties arising from the luxu-.
ries of life, were small tn comparison to what was
raised from articles of general consumption. If
yau want productive taxes, said Mr. S. you mult
come to fait, tea, and sugar, and articles of common
use. The gentleman from South Carolina -knew
this, and had therefore introduced them into his litt
of articles which he supposed would bear additional
duty. No one would doubt, therefore, that the
1 poor paid a very heavy poriion of those duties,
r Eut the gentleman laid, let us go on a little long
: er and try the experiment. Mr. S. afited, if it was
not the moment of all others for them to look out
1 for some other o:jeÂ£t for revenue belides commerce,
1 when their imposts were wholly in jeopardy. For,
; whether they au'd to the duty on fait, sugar er any
. 01 her article recommended, what certainty could
t riiey have upon their calculation* being realised,
: when they heard of their vessels being taken alrnoft
- by hundreds.
, Whenever commerce was mentioned they always
: heard of merchants having over-traded themselves
- And did not this very circumftaiice tell them that
t the revenue mult hereafter experience a diminution,
s Once, if they had over-traded themselves, they would
e in future do less.
I Another geHtleraan had said that 300 writs had
t been iflued in one city to recover duties. But
. this, it was said, was no proof at all that a redu&ion
, of revenue would ensue. it would at least, ke al
e lowed that it proved an inability to pay, and bad
a debts would doubtless be the consequence, and that
no certaiuty could b.eplaced upon this Jpecie-3 of
y In what situation, then,'laid country
i placed? If the French continued to our ffijps
j in the way they had lately heard of, we should not,
. he said, get re .renue fufficient to pay the intcieft of
I, our debt. So that gentlemen who opposed the
7 present motion, if they were fuccefsfal, would re
s duce the country to an alarming situation indeed,
e A curious way had bten proposed of retrenching
t our expences. Now we were threatead with for
e eign attacks, it was recommended that our naval
n and military eftabjifhnient Should be reduced, This
j was extraordinary dodtiine. He believed the gen
. tleman who recommended this saving, might as well
â¢, have gone or, and proposed an annihilation of the
a government ilfelf, and thenÂ«here would be no r.eed
t of revenue at all.
a Our exigences, said Mr. S. are fuch,-that those
'- gentlemen who refufe to support the present propo
e fitionj, miit take upon themselves the refpoofibility.
s With them, said-he, be it ; lie did not chufe to
e take it.
, They had some observations with refpeft to the
. conflitutionality of certain points in reference to
r divest taxation ; from refle&ing upon which, he
. was of opinion that indirect taxes had 'aat original
t Jyheen contemplated by jhe conllitution. It con
J templated a fylkm of direfi taxation, supported on
. the foundation of reprefentai ion, >by which dates
, should pay according to thei* population. This
"- fort of tax, he said,. was well calculated to inspire
d cautiori in the expenditure of the public money.
Mr. 8. said he had been mil h gratified by the
d observation of his colleague from the interior of the
country, that a land tax would be more gratifying
i- to him and his eonftituentc, than an rxtenlien of in
direct taxes. He hoped the resolution would be a
greed to. Whatever might be its fate, however^
U h* should feel fatislied with having done his duty
e in exerting himfelf in its behalf.
>f The call being loud for the committee to life,
1. the question wasput and negatived, there being on
y ly 13 for it.
>f Mr. Holland had no doubt with refpeft to the
r. constitutional power to lay diredt taxes. He would
e go farther gnd fay, that it might have been better
n if government had begun with them at its firft in
e ftitution ; but he was doabtful whether the present
was a proper time to commence the business. He
it was of opinion that taxes might yet be.es
y tended so as tÂ« prorfuoe the revenue wanted,
a Without examining into the principles of im-
II posts and excise, it might be supposed that they fell
d upon r _ 1 c merchants ; but,en examination, it would
g be found that they paid no more of them than in
y proportion to their consumption. The question
#4s whether the merchants or farmers consumed
1- molt ; for it had been insinuated that the farmer
ie scarcely p?Â»id any part of these duties.
d The genileinan from Maiyland, Mr. Craik,
e Teemed to think there were farmeis who paid little
- or nothing towards the expence of government.
â¢- He did not know any fucli. Farmers, he said, had
1- mostly numerous families, and therefore consumed
r larger quantities of imported articles. The fr,mi
lies of merchants were seldom so large, they coofe
d queutly cub fumed less. J arn.ers, he said, wetc al-
Iso failed with a r fxcife en thrir stills, from which
merchants were exempt. (
Merchants, he {aid, were in the habit of com
plaining, but government had not been inattentive
to their u-.tcre!b. He mentioned the allowance to
there in favor of tonnage. He he was con
vinced revenue was wanted, buttle thought there
was no necepty for going into direst taxes to raise
it. As to paying off the ecl>t, he doubled not, it
they raised ever so much revenue, government would
fxnd ways and means of (pending it.
He juftiiied the reduction of the military and na
val eftablirtiment. The military eftablilhment, he ,
fuid, was calculated for peace, and wasot nÂ« other j g
use thin to garrifan our forts ; and as the frigates
were not built, there was no necelTity for an efta- S
bUrtimcnt to man tl.ero \ and indeed'he thought it "5
better that they were not finifhed, as if they were 1
out at iea> they would probably soon be added to
the*ftrengfh nf a:, e'nemy. He wilhed we had less
ta do with foreign intetcoutfe. He did not know j
what good foreign eonnedions wereef to us, tho' i
\ government had long 6een hunting them up. He "
tho't the" more we lived by ourselves the bitter.
. He, belitwed it wpuld Ue best to pursue indirect i
taxes, if it were only with a view to keep the pub- 1
lie debt out of fight, as a part Â«f this debt had ori- i
ginally been the property of individuals, who would | j
murmur very much if they were called upon to pay 1
either towards reducing the principal* pr iifeliatg- f
iug the interest of it. j
The farmers already Raid ctax ontbeir lliils and
if they wete to pay a 'diredt tax also, it would be
like taxing both principal and interest. If a diredl
tax was aid, he hoped, thsiefoie, the duty on -Hills :
would be repealed.
Mr. Buck wilhed the deeifioa on the qseftion
might be poflponed, for the purpofeof reading the
communications jttil received irom the Prelident,
as they mighl throw a light upon the filiation of
this country with refpeft to foreign countries,
which might influence their decision upon it.
After ieveral observations on the propiiety of
the proposed potVponement, the question was at
Jcrigth taken on the foimer part of die refolulion,
viz. that proposing a diieft tax to be laid on land
r with improvement! thereon, *nd carried by a coÂ«-
fiderable majority there being 56 in its favour.
r On the quettion upon the Ltter part of, the is
| solution, viz. that a tax shall be laid upon slaves,
t with certain exceptions, being about to be put.
t Mr. Christie .moved tÂ® Â«dd, "on all real and
personal propelty wilhinthe United States."âOn
j fuggellion of Mr. Giles, the wordi, " and other
property" were substituted in place of the above,
t and ontfie question being .put upon it, it was nttga
} tived, there being only 18 in favour of it.
J The latter part ef the refolutioi) wa3 then pu:
as it flood, and carried, 54 members voting for it.
| The committee rose, reported the lefelutioÃ,
t and had leave to fit again. Adjourned.

And cause a pleating pain we can't express.

And jarring chaes into order grew.

But even high Heaven has had its holts rebel.
When, fruitlef> prov'd each effort to persuade,

A remarkable instance of this appears in the condufl
of the French. *We attacked the enemy viithJkilland
tourage, fays the modest Buonaparte. The French
nation by their -victories has aftontjhed Europe, are the e
words cf the Dire&ory in the gazette of the 10th inft.
The usual modesty is displayed in telling the poor, lit- F
tie, humbled kingi of Naples and Sardinia, the Haves ar
of the French, of the generous, humane, peace-loving t y
disposition of thit Republic, which the said kings will
rot believe one word of, as they know the contrary to
their cost. Thev tell them also Â»f the grandeur of
the Republic. All this is wellâit is the nohle 1
art of bragging according to the laws ef Gaftony. k
But they alfe baaft of their inviolable fidelity to trea
ties. What a plumper. The very nation boasts of
its fidelity to treaties which has publicly difclained the w
obligation of their treaty with the United States, be
cause they found in it nothing but difad-vantage.
Citizen Adet's note is a pretty theory ot good faith P
and the practice of the Buccaneers in the Weft-Indies

know what their treaty faith is as well as the king of I
Sardinia understands their generosity to their neigh

It has been stated that one >of the London newspa
pers, in opposition to the ministry, demanded two '
hundred and eighty pounds sterling a mbifth, for vin- *
dicating the French. This wÂ»s before the war broke 1
out between England and France. The wages were r
thought too high, and were not the'n agreed to by a
the French. How much is it worth for a printer in J,
Philadelphia to vindicate French depredations at this Â£
time of apprehension and embarraflment amongst the
merchants? Mr. Bache's monthly wages mull be high,

While offering to you our congratulation! ,on
the return of this auspicious day, we cannot re
frain from mingling an expreflion of extreme re
gret at the approaching close of your political life,.
When we beheld you as commander in chief of'
the armies of America, leading us to victory and the

liSving accomplifbed this grand objril, retiring from
your exalted (fation, and embracing the undiitin

the meafuieof your fame was-full
Bue when io obedience to the voice of your

our happiness difpell d by, the juflice,
vifderei, vigilance, and fism.nefs of your tonduft,
public credit maintained, our inestimable conftituti
011 protedled, infurredf ion crushed, and ths nation
al peace preservedâLanguage was wanting; to ex
press the fulnefs of qui feelings. Under such im
preiCons, great as eur confidence is in your succes
sor, we cannot but lament the refolutipn yo.u have

were improper ; ana that a day of retribution lie He
expected would come. He remarks, that Ameri- Al

nine commodious rooms, exdufiveol a spacious hall or en-
try, 21 feet square, two pair of ftaiis, suitable andconven-
ient pafiages, and excellent dry cellars. It is placed on a
fine he-lthy eminence, commanding beautiful views in p
every diredlion over the towns of Freiierickfburgh and,
Falmouth, and an extensive cultivated country.âThe*
grounds adjoining the house are neatly laid out in pleas-
ure and kitchen gardens interspersed with a variety of _
scarce trees, a choice colle&ion of flowers and flowering.
shrubs, and enriched by various ferts of the following
fruits, viz apples, pears, walnuts, chefnutsj-eherries,peach-

goofeberrieÂ»,ftraw!ierrieÂ»,and currants; the whale admi
rably varied by turfed Hopes which have been tormed by Â£
great labour and expence. Bordering ypÂ»n 'h.elV im
provements,are several lots, in a high&ate of cultivation, ,
and well set with red clover and orchard grass, from
which three heavy cropsofhay are taken every year. Ad
jacent thereto are two largeÂ«ud flouriftiing orchards; one
of wall chosen pea.l> trees, the other of apple and pear- P
trees, fele&edfrom the best nurseries in the state. Pro
perly detached l'rom the mansion house are extensive

thirty-fix grown cattle; apartments for fattening veals. a
muttons and lambs; extensive Iliads for (heep-, and other a
arrangements for stock <if every description, with a large F
and convenient reeeptable for provender, from which they
can be furnilhed without being exposed to the inclemency r
of the weather. An overseer's house, blackfihith's shop, J
and quarters fufficient to accommodate in the best man
ner more than fifty labourers.
The arable lands are fÂ© advantageously divided as to as- I 1
ford an opportunity of making a large quantity of Indian ]
corn annually , without bringing the field into fimilarcul- (
tare oftner than once in four years; eenfequently the c
lands may be improved by keeping up the iriclofurea during
the intermediate years, or may be bengficially fallowed for:
wheat and other grain at the option of the proprietor.
On the premises there is also a merchant mill with one
Ipair of best French burr l'tones, and one pair of Cologne ;
furnilhed with modern now leafed for the
unexpired term ot four years, at 1501 per annum, and all
grain for the use of the farm, hopper free, which is near

of free stone Bear-to the rivet, is-plentifully applied with
remarkable fine water and pofiefi'es a due proportion of ,
-meadow, which by having the command of water may
be considerably increased. The roads are gootf, and the
neighbourhood genteel and sociable. Infaft, exclufiveof
an improveableand well conditioned farm, the" value and
emolument inseparably conne&ed witn a mill, ferries,
quarries eligibly fltuated ; the profit? ariung
from an ice-house inferior to none in the state, and a gar
den of soup acres so abundantly stocked with vegetables
of all forts as to [be fully equal to the demand in market,
might be detailed many tother advantages, apper
taining to the fertility of these lands, which the fubferiber
conceives it unneceiTary to mention, being fully convinced
that when examined, it will be found to be a complete,
pleasant ari<l~fiealtny" Tciitfence, poneffing beauties anct
Convenience* fufficient to attraift the attention of any per
son defirousof becoming a purchaser.
The motive which induces the fubferiber to offer for
-sale an estate so Angularly beautiful and advantageous, is
a desire to become an inhabitant of Alexandria, where he
can with more ease attend to his interests in the neigh
bourhood ofthat city.
The purchaser may be accommodatedwith a few slaves

of the purchafc money will be required and' the balance
