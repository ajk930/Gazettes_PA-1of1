PitRPOKT Edwa*os, Esq. Dittria Attorney for the Hate
of ConneSicut.
New-Maven, Odoher 7, 1796,
Dear Sir,
I fhauld have written you last week, had I then been
able to afcertaiji certain farfts, the rumour of which I had
heard. A Mrs. Beers, a near neighbour to me, the wife
of Eben Beers, and daughter of captain Samuel Hoggins,
of this town, had been, for fourteen weeks, exceedingly
4iflrefTed with the Rhetimatifm, to fueh a decree that for
fourteen weeks previous to the 19th of lau month, she
had not keen able to walk across the room even with crut
ches, save only once, when she made out with the aflift
anee of crutches to hobble part of the way aero s her room.
On the 19th ot September last, (he procured a set of your
metallic substances, and in less than an hour after she had
begun to use them, in the manner directed by you, she
rase from her chair, and walked about lier haufe, and on
the next day she went abroad to her neighbours, having
thrown aide her crutches. I have this day paid her a visit
in company with her father, and Timothy Jones, Esq.
who lives in the street where she resides and diteiSly op
posite to her residence, and with Capt. Abel Burrett, who
is her next neighbor, and lives within eight yards of her
door. I requested her to relate her cafe over in their
presence, which she did, and these gentlemen all with one
VOiCe, ltopportcrt, 7Twm >iÂ»
It is a duty which yon owe yourfelf and the world to pro-
Miulge this event. I am, very tefpeAfully,
Your obedient fm-vant,

N. B. She fays her fever has left her, her appetite has
returned, and she is in a fair way to be reflated to perfect
health.
Rev. Mr. Spalding, of Salem.
This may certify, that the fubferiber, in his visits among
his people, has used Dr. Perkins's metallic paints, to re
lieve paias and inflammations of various kinds, and has
fueceedcd to his astonishment. They have feldam failed
to relieve the head-ach, teeth-ach, ague in the face, in
flammation in the eyes, cramp, cholic, rheematifm, pains
of the breast and fide, biles, fcaldsand burnsâSometimes
there has been a perfed cure from one operation. A lad
â¢who had been confined three days with high symptoms of
a fever, very hot and full of pain, by an operation of the
paints, designed to relieve his head, his face turned pMe
and cold, hi*- fever and pain immediately left him, and in
a few days he was out of doors ; the year before, at the
fame season, he was taken with the f.'.me symptoms, aÂ»d
lay extremely sick forty days. The efficacy of the metal
lic points has gained great credit in this town.
JOSHUA SPALDING.
December 5, 1796.
Rev. Elhanan Winchejtx*.
I certify, that on the 21ft of March, 179)5, I saw Dr.
Perkins's method of cure by pointed metallic infiruments,
tried wiih luccÂ»Cc-io the poor-hnufe or hettMiajj-bowfe in
Philad lphia ; especially npen a man who was unable to
lift his right haijd to his head, as was tried beforehand, hnt
â who after a few minutes operation, was able to remove it
at pleasure ; and in my fight, put it with ease on the top
of his head and back of his n<ck, and in all directions.
Nearly the fame effect took place upen a woman ; and
ALL that I saw treated, profeffed that their pains <-eased
after being treated a Snort time: and several came volun
tarily, and iif my hearing thanked the Dr. for cures he
flad performed on them about' eight weeks before, in re
moving pains from them, which they declared had not
since returned so that from what I saw with my own
eyes and what I have heard, I have great hopes that this
methed will greatly tend to alleviate the miseries of man
kind. ELUANAN WINCHESTER.
Philadelphia, 1796.
Extract from a Providence Papar.
Communication.
Dr. Perkins's invention for removing pains from the
human body, begiHs to obtain reputation in proportion
to its utility and efficacy. The fimplieity of the operati
on was at firft an obstacle to its credit; but<the flood of e
videace in its favor, from a&ual experiment, is at length
too powerful to be refilled.

Mr. \jrnum, 1 consider it the tndjfpenfi'bie duty of
this houle, and of e-ch and every member of it, as
much as it is 'in our power, to preserve inviolate the
public iaith, and to make all neeeffary provilion for 'he
payment-os 'the just debts of the United States. But
in doingQrij, we ought to have recourse to such objeiU
of luxation, and such metfiods of colleilion, as wc
ha ve i . ilon to believe will be moll agreeable to the
'people.
I He government, no doubt, under an impression,
that tliey were doing right, have reformed to imposts &
, excites, as rhe proper mock? of raising a revenue; and
experience has evinced that this mode of taxation, is"
â a ftafible one in the United States-; it places very lai ge
fur:s ot money in your treasury annually ; and it is
paid by the people, with a greater degree of chei'rful
nets in thijr way, thanit probably svould through the
channel ot diraiil taxation. Many of the objt from
which our revenue is railed, by duties of"itnpolt and
excise, are articl s or luxury and fuperfiuity, and as
theo are generally considered to be such, t'hofe who
make uie of them, do willingly piy the tax laid on
them by the government ; andlpreltime will continue
jo to do, so long as the money (hall be appropriited to
purposes, which are.rrsmotrve of the good of the U
juou. Duties on thole articles which may be more
properly clalTcd among the necessaries of life, are paid
hy the tonfumtr when he purch;fes the article, and
are less felt by him, than they wtreld be, if the whole
duties of a rear were to be paid in a gross sum.
By this mode of ttxation, it is true, s>? pÃor and
induilnous people, whose income and labor barely
-iuppiying them with the common neceflaries of lire,
do not pay any part of the tax or duty on wines, teas,
silk, carnages and a great variety of matters; and
why Ihould they, w hen their neceflity entirely pre
vents their eVer making use of them ? Yet the duty is
paid, and it comes from the proper source; the man
in poliafiion ol the money remits it to the publit-; and
the poor man is thereby enabled to supply his children
â with bresd, to afluage their hunger; and by clothing
to guard them tgainfl the inclemency of the weather.
Thousands of such people are within the United States.
It is a inaxim tiiat will always hold good, that snoney
must be looked for where itand not where it is not.
Hence I conceive the present mode of <-ol!e<Â£ling a
revenue, under the government of the United States,
to be far preferable to a land tax : it is paid by the peo
â ple with more facility, and realized by the government
with more certainty.
Besides, the fvAern is arranged and in a ragular ope
rition ; all the oScers are appointed, who would be
neeeffary if a much larger sum were to be raised in the
fame way; so that the expense of colle&ing any addi
tibnal duties on and cxcife would be compara
tively very small.
I am therefore clearly of the opinion, that xny addi
tional sums which may at present be needed, for de
frayiig the expense- of the government, or for the
payment of their just debts, ought to be raised by du
ties on imposts and excises : that is a method of taxa
tion wit h which we are acquainted, and which experi
ence has taught us the operation of, under this govern
ment.
But such is the variegated interest of the United
States, and such their diverfified method of levying
and collecting dired tuxes, that ho uniform system ef
ciretf Uxatimi can fce devised, which will apply to the '
cuCom of any two cf th; states; and unless yon adopt
the rules ot some one of the states your ly.lem will be '
diverse from any one which has ever been practised 1
upen m any put of the Union. Bu: if vou adopt the
method which has been prefcribedbv any one of the
state governments ant! which miy probahlv be very
properly adopted, to.suit the cireumftances and .-onci
lurethe feelings of the people of such state, even in '
that cale, you will have the prevailing opir.ion ot' sis- 1
\teen Sites out of sixteen, diredlly opposed to your fy- 1
fle.ii. And this opinion having been acquired 1 rorn
long experience ot the operation of direct taxes.( which â¢
molt oÂ£ the states have of neceflity conilamly had re- i
fort to, for the support of their state governments, and
tp. uifchargiag the debts contraflud in the late -wa- '
with Great-Britain) and which being founded on lo- :
cal cii cnmfhnces, habits and attachments, are vcrv '
hard to be eradicated, will very ranch retard the one- 1
ration of the Ivftem, if Hot-render it entirely imprac- i
' r
The Secretary's report on this fubjeiS brings into
view, three modes of levying direfl taxes, with which
the' House are acquainted.
Ihe firft of these modes has for its objeil, an appor- '
tionment on each on constitutional principles '
afiigaiug a time for the money to be paid into the trea
sury, on failure of any .state, to be ifleffed and collefl- ;
ed by th* authority of the United States, upon the 1
lame objects of taxation and pursuant to the fame
rule, hy which the last taxes were WJfeffed and collefled 1
ln/uch lUte. i
" ift. That an AJI of Congress fcou Id be passed,
declaring the quotas of the different ftateJ; iffigniiw
a tune for. payment .nto the treaftfry, 21 , d preferring,.
delinquency, that the said quotas should be
ai.efled and collected by authority o/the United States,
upon the :ame objefl* of taxation, and pursuant to the
l.:ire rules by which the iall faxes were assessed and
by the reipecHivf ftites.
" id. That the Aa of Congress should direct that
the proposed tax ihouid l,e alVcfi'ed and colleikd under i
â Buth : r..tyof the United States, upon the; fame Â«bj<*U
Ol taxation, and pirrfuant to the rules of the colleilion t
by which taxes are collected in states relWUvcly
"V' J ha !- the ot ' Con Srefs Ihould detine cer
tain objects w taxation aud principles of afletTment
according to which the proposed tax fcould be assessed
in a.l tne Hates, to becoliccled pursuant to uniform re
gulation^.
Ihe report treats the firft mode as entirely ur.wor- I
t.iy o. conSv.ercc. It gives some countenance to the c
fecondmode ; but finally concludes that it is inelrgible
âthe third mode is recogtured as the preferable one â¢ f
fÃd has bten agreed to by the committee of wav, and '
means; but, fir, I uiUt take the, liberty of differing (
from them in opinion on tiiefubjea ; the mode which t
t .ey have agrtc-d to, is in my mind by far the moll ?
or the
Itideflroys that equality of taxaticn, which oupht
to tharsctei ize every nation, ind which bv Arift at- '
tcniion and iudufiry, founded o* tile true principles of c
equal liberty from ma:* years moil of

It is cslculated to laddie the ii.duftrious farmers 1
cf oti' country with an tin iue burthen. From the
induftrv, toil, and fatigue, of tbofe whose lot it is 1
to till the earth, all orders, faculties and profeffions 1
of men derive l.etr foppoit. many thou lands 1
ol people in thÂ« U.iiud States, live ftom year to '
yeai without once feeling the fatigue of hard labor? \
a'd many of t. -m fcwrmrftng in li>Â« lr y, from the
of capitaiJ artfully acquired from the hard f
carries of the unws y laborer. And fhail a fyf. ?
tern ol dired taxation bf adopted under the go- 1
Tciomcnt, wriucb o,c peepk have lurmcd upoo the J I
r principles of eqtial libei ?y, which vvill oblige th?
induorioH9 farmer to~pay a lai>d tax, and t tax
his building, which in most iuflancej includes nine
teen-twentieths 01 hiÂ« p.operty ; and all the money
holders, holders of all i>;her kinds of property, and
those who from profeffion, or epolumect derived
f from the operation of our government, are living in
' alfluence, be exonerated from any part of the bur
then, except a small pittance for the hotifes they
live in ? No, fir, it appears to me, that a lyrtem
like this nev;r can be agreed to in thn hoHfe. A
gain, felting aside the dependence of he commu
nity, on the indultry of the farmer and tie mechanic
for food and raiment, are not these 6e men on
. whom the government mutt principally rely, for
personal service, in defence of the countiy, <n cafe
. of an invalicn frofn a foreign enemy's IF to, which
I prefumf will net be controverted, are they not
entitled to equal privileges iVith their fellow citizens,
ascoiding t* the property they poiTels ?, mod as
suredly they are : but very wiii-ly othetwife mil
be the cafe, if the fvftem before you (liquid be
adopted. The time that mud be fpcnt in forming
an estimate on new principles through the United
States, and the great number of new officers {at
leall 3,500 woald be urecetTarv) in afieffing and col
lecting the tax would add very effintially to the
burthen. If a direst tax fhonld e*er become ne
ceflary under this government, I lupe it will em
brace all the objeils of taxation, which have been
designated by the particular state govefements ;
and the ingtnious reafoaing in the
secretary's report, against the prailibllity of the
second mode therein stated, I am unable to fignre to
myfelf any f)olfible inconvenience which would arise
from it on the ground of the objedtions. And why
that system was not adhered to in the report, am at
a loss, for the resolve directing the report to be
made contemplated no other.
But I am, from my present opinion induced to
give the fyi'tem firft mentioned io the report the
preference. The several dates being convinced,
that tbe authority of the general government would
be exercised, if the money was not furniftied by the
time prefixed, they would in all probability make
the remittance ; but if any (late (hould fail of doing
it, this government would make the alfeffment an
the inhabitants of the delinquent (late ; and wonld
be under as good advantages forcolle&ing it, as it
would have been to have made the aiTeffment on the
inhabitants in the firft instance ; and the reafoaing
in the report does not apply to the-cafe, for under
the Former government the Congress had no power
to assess money on individuals in any cr.fe, and there
fore were under the necessity of depending on the
will of the (late government alone, foi a compli
ance with the requisitions; but underthe prefect
government the" power of Congress to assess and
coiled such deficiency, is commeafkirite with their
power to make the requisition.
This mode of laying direst taxes, would require
no new officers, the money would be colie&ed by
the date officers with the (late taxe?, and would be
attended with much less expence to the people,
than either of tbe other modes presented.
But there are almost inseparable objefliom to a
dired tax uaderthis government, view it is what
light yju please; and I presume, that the govern
ment never will adopt one, until all the objects of
indirect taxation are exhausted and the demands on
the treasury make it iodifj>epfably necessary. Is
that the cafe at this time ? No Sir, i think it it
not ; but that very large additional sums may be
drawn from that source if it were necessary.
Before we go fully into ap investigation of the
principles of a Land Tax, perhaps it would be ex T
pedient to enquire, into the annual receipts and
expenditures at the treaftiry, and to fatiafy our
selves whether there is, or is not a neceflity of lay
ing additional taxes of any kind And if on ration
calculation it ftiould be found, that the' proceeds
of exilHng taxes, will be commensurate with the
demands on the treasury, for the four succeeding
years, your laud tax will certainly be unnecessary.
Being niyfelf convinced of the fad, I will take
the liberty of dating the principles on which tny
opinion is founded.
The annual expence of the government. Including
all demands, is estimated by the Secretary of the Trea- 1
fury up to the year jÃot, at 7.463,000
1 he report eflimates the duties on im

â¢ Which leaves aa snmial balance z
gainft the Treasury of 1 -6-
but it is tobe'ohferved that this statement is
made frotnt';c money received into the Treasury
in 1795, and is.the pioduft of the revenue in 1794.
And by recurring to the revenue returns for 170 c
we fmd the net amount of duties on imposts and
tonnage in that year is 7,959,409,70.
Which gives a balance in favour of the Treasury
oeiides tupplying the sum calculated to be taifed by
direct tax of 496 409,70.
The amount of the revenue tÂ®be derived
from Eicife, is also estimated from the ad.ua!
receipts in the Treasury iu 1795, and is indis
putably mach tea low ; for ia man) parts of
the United States the excise law had iufl be
gun to operate ic 1794, in which year a great
part ot the receipts ef the Treasury in 1795,
adually acc, i:td. It is, I think, moil pron'er
to take this estimate from the m u R. rcceut date
of receipts, and
f rom Sept. 30, 1795 to Oft. I, 1796, the
receipts on account 0/ tlic ncife were , 6 , , r
Since that sum has been collected from the
peop e, an additional tax has bean laid by way
of excise, which will conCderablv increase / I
that branch of the revenue.

From the great increase of the ReTenue
trom 1795 to 1796, I think that this (late
mcr.t can be rthed on, with a decree of cer
tainty, as a proper estimate of our annual re
venue from exiftiiig taxes, which gives an an

The estimate in detail for those departments

-And I am of opinion that the leal annual ex
pence of those departments, will fall tonfidcrably
short of this estimate taking it so; four years, if pro
per ecenor.iy is nftd, which will further rncreak
thefurplus money in your treasury. The general

to be continued no longer than the fourth of

to them in the estimate cannot be considered aÂ« an
apnrui.l expence.

that the (late of the army will admit of
a reduction of that expense too,cco

jedl of direifl taxes, as an eftirr.ate of the

military pentions gives another balance
in favor of the Treasury, of 653,041.13
This fun. together with tlie surplus
revenue in favor of the treasury make 1,682,7,1.51
Thisfam is the net produce of our annual reven
ues over the Aims necessary to difoharge all de
mands on the Treasury for the four fucceedine
years.
From this ftateraent, which is taken from authen
tic documents, does it Dot clcarly appear that it is
entirely unnecessary, and even inexpedient ta im-,
pose additional taxes of any deaomination in the
present itffion ? While the exiftitig taxes give you
a net income of more than a million and an half Â«>f
dollars annually, over and above, the annual de
mand, which can, is the common course of occur
rences, be made on the Treasury, for the four fac
ceeding years, can you with any propriety, lay
additional burthens on the people ? it hat ofun
been ehfeived, in the couife of the debate on this
fubjeft, that-all would agree in tiie necessity of ad
ditional taxes ; 1/ut fe far from an unanimous con
currence in this opinion, oÂ« Â» onndid examination

moni.courle of events, will not,every member of this
hcufr, consider any additional taxes to be unneces

their attachment to the principles which fanned the

29 Brumaire, Nov. th
" 1 have been so harraffed witW-fttWlte, citizsns *
dire6tois, that it- has t>een tor me to make
known all the military movements, t'uat have pre. n<
ceded the battle of Arcole, which has decided the
fate of Italy.
" Informed that field marshal Alvinzy, com- ve
inaiiding the army of the empeistr, approached sic
Verona, foi the putpofe of forming a junction with v '
the divifiyns of his army in Tyrol, I filed off along g*
the Adige, witb the divifionsof Aogereau and Mat gt
fenn, and in. the tiight of the 24th and 25th, threw R
a bridge of boats across at Ronco, where we paffec!
that river. 1 was in hopes of arriving in 1 e morn
ing at Villa Nova, and by that mcarts taking the pc
eaetny's park of artillery and baggage, and attack- so
ing them iw flank and rear. The "head-qiiartera of &'
general Alviozy were at Caldero. But the enemy, pi'
vhohad heard of some movements, had sent a regt- th
went of Croats, and some regiments of Hungarians, vi*
into the village of Areole, extremely strong by it<- pa
position in the tfiidll of mat fhes and canals.
" This village (lopped the advanifed guard of
the army during the whole day, 1 It was in vain K
that all the generals, feeling the importance of the iw<
time, precipitated thetnfclves at its head to oblige wÂ«
our columns to pass the little bridge of Arcole. cci
ToÂ« much courage wasdangetouj. They were al- tie
moftjjlljwounded. Generals Verdier, Bon, Verne,
Lafne, were put. out of combat. Attgercsu, lay
Â»> ing hoU of a standard', advanced to the extremity
f of the bridge, where he remained for several minutes
without producing any effect. NJeanwhilelt was
t neeeffary to pass that bridge, or t-ikc a circuitous
rootÂ® of several leagues, which would have made
our whole operation mifcarrv : I repaired myfelf to
the spot; I asked the fwldiers if they ftfll were the
'o-. conquerors of Lodi ? My presence produced an
o- emotion amonjr the troops; which still determined
nd me to rifle the passage. General Lafne, already
ut wounded twice with shot, received a third and more
ur dangetous wound. General Vignolle was aifo
wounded. We were obliged to renounce forcing
the village in front, and tÂ» wait till a column, com
manded by general Guieux, whom J had sent thro'
Albaredo, had arrived ; he did not arrive till nighr,.
took the village, four pieces of cannon, and made
some hundreds of prisoners. In the interval general
Maffena at'acked a division which the enemy made
ct defile from their head-quarters againll our left, dif
comfued, and put it completely to the route.
" It had been thought expedient to evacuate,
during night, the village of Arcole, and we expedt
ed, at day-break, to be attacked by the whole army
of the enemy, who were found to have had time to
file ot their baggage and parks of artillery,
and to advance to the rear to receive us.
" At day treak, the combat commenced every
where with the greatest ajertnefs. Maffena, who
t Â» was on the left, put (he enemy to the rout, and
,p' pursued them to the gates of Caldero. General
â re Robert who was on the middle causeway with the
Â« r 75'h, defeated the enemy with the bayenct, and
covered the field of battle with de*d bodies. 1 or
-7.' dered the Adjutant-General te advance along the
Adige, w'th a halfbrigade to turn the whÂ«le lefc
a of the enemy, but the eoumry presented inÂ»Â»jipilÂ»le
obllacles : it was in vain for the brave General to
plunge himfelf up to the neck in water : he could
not ess. A A diversion of any conleqaence. In the
a ! rrigtlT bet-?Â»een she 26th iliÂ»d \ Nov. 16, ly)
1 had b idges" thrown over the canals and the
IS marshes.
General Angereau patted them with his divi.
vision. At fix in the morning we were within
light ; General Mad'ena, on the left ; General Ro
bert in the centre, and General Angeieiu on the
right. The enemy attacked the centre vigoroully,
which fell back. I then drew the $2d from the
e left, and placed it in itmfn:icade in the woods, and
h the inftuiit (he enemy preffcd the centre and was
k on the point of turning our right General Cardan
's ne, at the bead of the sallied forth from his
'> ambuscade, took the enemy in flank, and made
c horrible carmine.
" The left of thu enemy was fupporled by the
1 marfbes, and awed our right by thwir superior num
ber. I ordered citizcp Herctile, the officer of my
guides, to chuoie 2J me aof hi-! company to ad
vance along the Adige, to the diflance of half a
' leagn-, to turn all the marfties which supported the
S energy's left, and to fall afterwards into full gallop,
into the euemy's rear, ai d make several trumpets
c foundâTfcii mÂ»ixrvrÂ« was fteifetlly fuccefsfu ;
c the holtle infantry gave way, and G ei) c r al AÂ«ge
- reau took ndvantage of the moment. But it ftiH
made rctilUnce, though it was retreating when s ,

pieces of cannon, wh.,m I bad made defile thfough 1
' Porto Lignago, to take pofitioii in itie tear off the
enemy, audio tall upon their backs during'the
combat, finifhed by completely putting them to
1 the* rout. General Maffena, who had ictuined to '
the cetitre, marched ftr*igh( to j|-,Â« village of Ar
-1 cole, which he took, and pursued the eneuiy to
near the village of St. Boniloiio, but night prevent- '
ed our ;oing farther. '
" The fruit of the battle of Arcole is between
4a id 5000 prisoners, 4 ft. dps colours, and 1$ t
; pieces of cannon. The en .my loft at leatt 4000 <
kille , aiid had as many wppiued. Be fides the ge- '
