CONGRESS or ths UNITED STATES.
' HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, January 20.
The house entered upon a consideration of the
resolution repotted yesterday by the committee of
the whole on t!.s fubjefl of further levenue.
Mr. Coit, wished for a division of the qucftion,
vix. that the proposition for a tax on land, and that
for a tax on slaves, (hould be put leparately.
Mr. Swanwick called for the yeas and nays.
. They were agreed to be taken.
Mr. Nicholas thought the lefolution (hould not I
be divided, but that the propolitions/or a tax on
land, and a tax on (laves, flionld Â£0 together i as he ,
(hould objcdl to vote for the tax on land, except j
that on (laves accompanied it.âHe thought the
gentleman had better try the cjuellion, by'uioving to
strike out what refpedted (laves.
Mr. Madison thought it wiwld Le bed ft>r the
two propolltions to go togetbei ? but if not, he |
-rigmal jjj no t think the embarrassments iiifuperable. If
.of hi- t |,e q Ue sti on wgs divided, those \ylio thought a tax
called on Caves necessary, mull vote for the lirli part, and [
if the second was rcjeiSed, there could not be j
) wanting an opportunity of voting again/t the tax on I .
llund' ' and * was "cccffary to observe that it had been j
found expedient to aflociate these two taxes toge-
Deco- in order to do justice to, and to confo'm to
the eflabltlhed ufageÂ«f a very large traiS of eoun
-1 Cut try, who were entitko to some degree of attention,
"n. and to whom a tax on land, without a tax on slaves,
Â«ould be very objectionable. â
Mr. Coit said, he could not gratify the gefitlernan
from Virginia, by varying his moti#n, as it would
not answer the purpose he h&d in view.
Mr. Nicholas supposed if the motion was perlif
ted in, be was at liberty to move to insert slaves in j
Doc- the part of the resolution. The gentleman ,
" rtainl y ew h' s own views best ; or he thought
Milt " wa * P9ffiW e t0 have fettled the bufmefs be pro

Mr. .W. Smith saw no difficulty on the fubjeft, U
Gentlemen would vote for the firlt part oi" tlw rr- ; "
folutioH, in hopes that the feconf 1 but J"
â *"Â«^ l an opporiutiity
of voting on the main quedion, aDd thereby defeat C<i

the Mr. Van Cortlandt weuld vote for both together, .
btlt not fepat ately. * ' 1D
'and r ' 9 al i atl " enquired as to a point of order, OU
!, to 4 T hlt: ' ,er tl)e part of the refulution was car- tf '
mit- ntd Â» and the fet.rnd negatived, the queftiph would
not then be taken upon the resolution as amended ?
the The Speaker aafivered in the affirmative. W!
Mr. Williams said it would fa-ve time if the quef- t Â°'
th - tion was taken upon the together;
rom for if several gentlemen voted agaiuft the (iri pro- pcl
1 / poiition, lclt the lad (hould not pass, ti;o whole ,0
- 9i|g'lit in this way Le defeated. He thought a vote CIU
might be lafely taken upon the whole together, aa
> etr . no one would be bound by the vote which he now 11 v
g are to votc i" favoar of the bih', if he (hould not ,
qr approve of it. For his own part he wished to fee
the plan, though he did not know that he (hould a,<i
vote for it. wai
Mr. Nicholas supposed there was not the difficul fpe '
ty mentioned by the gentleman from New Yetk. WO '
GentlemeD would not rifle the whole by votiVg a- ed 1
gainst the fir ft part of the resolution ; fincc, it ihe -
( lecond was not carried, they could after'War<UiÂ«fcK proi
_ the whole. J mul
The question was then taken by yeas and nays :lbl=
48 to 39. agai
The lecord part of therefolution relative toilaves
was about to be put, when J eai
Mr. Gallatin said, l.efore the question was taken
on this diviiion, he would jufttnention why this fpe- cr>u!
:he cl " personal ptoperty was brought under view, Â°. ft]
les whtlft all othffr personal property was unnoticed. tlu "
It wag very true, that (lock upon a farm in the acce
:r- nor . and ea ' l yn states, paid nearly as great a pro- 1
of .portion of the taxes of tbofe (tates, as the negroes nch
li. did those of the southern Rates, and therefore it bc 1
ns might seem somewhat wrong to introduce negroes WOM
in ' 111 ' he one-cafe and not cattle in the ether. The nii ' c) '
n _ reason which induced the committee of ways and bcin l
e . means to was, that negroes are con- lhe
k- bned to certain spots of land in the southern states, ,hc Â«
whilst horses and cattle extend nearly equally over I iaid '
a whole country. A land tax, unaccompanied with i whet

Mr. G. Jacfcfon said hewasagainft all species of
direst taxation, but particularly on this species ;
and, if a tax on land was carried he Ihould bring
of the orward a 'evolution to lay a tax upon all property
\ a r vrfted in public securities. He wished for the yeas
and nays on this question.
c^jon The yen and nays were agreed to be taken,
dth' t r ' Nicholas wondered to hear the obfeivation
of his colleague. He fliould vote for the queition,
though he and his conlh'tuents would be affefiled by'
r ' 2 '"' it; but, in the district which that gentleman repre- â¢
, j fen ted, there were no slaves, and it was therefore 1
his and his conlti.uems interell to have a tax on I

Mr. G. Jarkfon laid, if was not so much on ac- f

' jj. there were few slaves. He said in the rgprefentati- (
on to thaf house thÂ« labour of the nee roes had been t
a tax
a coiifidered as sto 3 with rcfpcet te white persons, p
' t therefore the ability of the date to pay was confi- Â«
dered in the fame proportion. His colleague from n
the mountains {Mr. G. Jatkfon) fhojild ccufider tl
r that il the holders of Haves were not to pay a pot- t<
tion f the tax imposed on the itate of Virginia, it
would fall very heavy Hp6n his condiments, jnd tl
thofo of iiis colleague, where few blacks wsxc kcjÂ»t. w
He hoped, therefore, it would pass. U
S ' Mr. Jeremiah Smith Â»is aivare that a tax on at
â man ave Â® wou lighten the lax 011 laud in the southern bi
(Utes, and therefore 1 e did not wonder *t the re- w
prefesrtatives from these states wishing it to take di
place; but by 10 apportioning ihe tax, would not an
the land-holders in the southern dates pay less than a
the land-holders in parts of the unjou where 1)0 in
i j | slaves were kept }He beljeyed they would. A tai
ro perfbn, for inftaoce, in NewHatnplhire, holding an
P Â° the value of looel. in land, would pav a larger pur- aci

but ' a " d an objection to this mode of taxing the fyl
. foÂ«thern states, as, though the tax would,fall more ty,

genuine, and true principles of republican .govern ti
nient, and good order. Unaffected by the gan- e
grene of envy, jealoufv, or disappointment, he free-
Jy paid tp fupereminent merit, and unrivalled pub- i
lie services, their well earned tr.ibutts of applause, j
and gratitude. His politics weie not merely theo
retical, his praftice evineed their veri.y, he was not p
contented with only declaiming foi the liberties of
hiÃ country, when they were really in hazard ; but f
ha fought for them. His aftions attested in the. d
field*, the Gncerity of his opinions in the Senate.
He deserved, and received the mod honorable testi
monials of the confidence of his countrymen, by n
appointments to the highest official (latious in this
commonwealth. Alas! he is goneâloved, and a;
lamented by all who knew him. May his , furviv- b

of ~1781, a; the head of a regiment of the yceraaa tt
