fIbUSE OF COMMONS.
% WEDNESDAY, APRIL 16.
y Concluded frpm ytfitrdny's Galette.) I
Mr. Fol v 41 The fubjed. now proposed
to the confit'.srarion of the Committee, is
of such vast and fcrious importance, that I
â¢think it unnecessary to apologize for follow
ing the right hon. geutlema;!' through some
of the v inous statements and calculations he
!:as made,, and offering my reasons for dif
fering rq'jfl effentinlly in opinion with him,
not only with regard to the (late of the Fi
nances of the country, but.affo with refpeft
to the deductions which he has endeavouf
ed to establish from the positions which he
his- brought forward. The rosrd, fir, we
have to travel,' is notbefet with flowers, but
opens to our view a comfortMs and dreary
" profpeft, and, while we ratltly continue to
purfiii it, wc are deprived of every mean* to
avo'id the impending precipices with which
it is on every fide surrounded. I ititreat
gentlemen to conf:der and compare the
statements they have heard this day from"
the right hon. gentleman, and those With
which he has, on former occasions, but too
fuccefsfully deluded them. But however
fpecioiis and unfounded his financial calcu
lations have formerly been, they are even
exceeded in delufibn by his statements made
this day, which I maintain are altogether
unprecedented in the history of Finance.â
The right hon. gentleman came forward in
the month of December last, and having
succeeded in obtaining a supply of 18 milli
ons, he now 'repeats the experiment, and
calls on us for the fame sum. 15flt how has
he prefaced this sudden and extraordinary
demand ? He has declared, that the talk
of applying to the House, after so short an
interval, and for so large a sum, is irksome
and painful to him, and that he has been
disappointed in his views. That he has
disappointed us by this unexpefted applies- ;
tion, I most readily admit ; but what parti-1
cular disappointments the right hon. gentle
nan may have experienced, which compels
him to have recourse to our liberality, after
the recent and mpft convincing proof we
have already given cf it, or which can juf
tify his applying for this enormous sum, I
em, fir, at a loss to conceive. Does he for
get the language which he used in this
House on the 7th of last December, and
must he be reminded, that 18 millions then
advanced were given not so much with an
idea of prosecuting the war, as with an earn
est hope of enabling him to forward tire
great and desirable work of Peace ? Can
it be necessary sot me to recall to him the
public wishes at that period for a speedy
termination of the war ; and that the Loan
was accofriplifhed- on the general hope of a
fuccefsful ifl'iie to lord Malmefoury's embas
sy ? He told us then, that the advance of
18 millions ' was aVi ample supply, for such
were h's words, for the exigencies of the
State, and adequate to the pressure of eve
ry circumstance. Yet no disappointment
has iince happened to induce him so sud
denly to repeat the experiment. I cannot
for my part perceive any disappointment
which can have compelled him to this un
precedented application, except the state of
Ireland alone, and the sum required for the
embarrassments of that kingdom amounts
to a million and a half. What other disap
pointments the' sanguine expectations of
the right hon. gentleman may have fuffered,
he' hS* not condescended to inform ns. I
clearly exposed the delusions with which he
amused the House when he called on us to
provide for the last Loan of 18 milltons,
and the orent has fully verified what I then
pre fled so earnestly on the attention of gen
tlemen. With refpeft to the statements
made in the report of the Seledt Commit
tee, of the produce of the permanent taxes
for the years 1793, 1794. and 1795, lam
willing to give the right hon. gentleman
every benefit he may wifli to derive from
that report, however I may differ in opinion
with the fubjett matter of the report, and
objedt to the documents on which it is
foujided-. In speaking of the produce of
the taxes in 1796, as stated in the report of
the Seledt Committee, on which he builds
his calculations, (I stop here for a moment,
andrequeft it may be remembered, that I do
not agree to th<; extent of that part of the
report, or to the use which he makes cf it),
not knowing the amount of the Hat and
Legacy Duty, I allow them to produce
what he himfelf thinks fit to state ; but whea
I come to the Wine duty, there fir, I beg
leave to observe, that I differ both with the
Committee and with the right hon. gentle
man. The ftpek in hand cannot, in any
refpeÂ£t, be considered as air annual tax, and,
indeed, the right hon. gentleman seems by
the very arguments which he introduces in
favour of that opinion to admit that it can
not be viewed in that light. The fair way
to estimate the produce of the wine duty is
to calculate it for 1796 on the fame ground
as if it was considered in 1795 ; and I will,
fir, by a parity of reasoning, argue for the
produce of * 797Â» by the experience we
have had of the preceding year. Thus
' having given the right hon. gentleman full
credit fcr the Hat and Legacy duty, and
admitting that a duty of 2 1. per ton will
produce in '96, what it produced in '95
. I' Hill maintain that that there remains a de
ficiency of no lefsa sum than 357,00 c!. in
the produce of the brought forward
by the right hon. gentleman. I will not ar
gue tint because he was mii.ut 357,'0c1. he
should have immediately proceetded to pro
vide for it; but I will contend, that for
him to m'aTntairi that he had a furpjus when
he was aitually minui 357,0001. is a delufi
on-t'f too gross and palpable a nature to
impose on the understanding. But if even
the taxes- cf 1796 produced the sum it was
intended thty should, there would Hill be a
deficiency of 88,ootl. and that according 1
to the report of the Select Committee.â 1
Lit us then ccn&cfer that at the beginning '
of tne fciiijn we vfcrc ic*,l. iWt;
that in Oitob'cr the "right lion, gentleman
funds his Navy bills,Tuid immediately after,
in December, makes his Loan, flioiild lie not
thtn have said intereft of the taxes
which have been proposed, it appeai-s that
a sum of I,Bcx>,cod. in taxes would not be
too much for the v irious calls of the prefer.t
moment. The deficiency on my calculation
amounts to 47c,"0c1. and not to 2ic,0001.
as stated by the Vight hon. gentleman, and
in the report of the Select Committee.â
And here, {if, I tl'iuk it neceflary to de
clare, that the report of that Comn>)iitee
does nttt merit the eulogium which has been
lavished on it. I believe it has originated
from, and has bieji conducted with grtod in
tentions, but that it is particularly. clear,
that it is founded 011 convincing documents,
and that it is -supported by evident and ac
i curate calculations, I can by no means ad
! Hiit. For I beg leaÂ« to aflf, what has been
the line ofconduft pursued by the members
of the Committee ! They sent to the pub
lic offices for the calculations in the refpet
tive departments ; and on these papers,.fo
supplied through the very channel of Gov
ernment, they proceeded to form a decisive
opinion ; and here I must notice, that in de
livering their decision to the"house, they have
merely grounded their proceedings 011 the
authorities furnifhed incontcftibly by go.'trn
ment, and which alone we are thus called
â¢ ;pon to fan&ion. In dating the produce of
the permanent taxe3, they have recourse to
the stoppage of the distilleries, for the pur
pose of accounting for the deficiency which
took place in them, and proceeding on the
fame system, they also allude to the boun
ties granted to seamen in 1796, when it
cannot be denied, that these bounties were
hi reality issued not in one year, but within
a year and a half. This conduct Was there
: fore prejudicial to the produce of the perma
nent taxes in 1795, an d to of other
years. They fay, that the stoppage of the
distilleries between June 1795, and Novem
bers 796, must have materially affedted the
I amount of that part of the produce which
| arises from the duty on Britilh spirits. They
do not venture to state the precise deficiency,
1 but on comparing the produce of the duties
on Britilh spirits in 1796, with the average
1 produce of the fame duties in the three pre
! ceding years, the deficiency is said to be
j 557,7931. They immediately after admit
S that upon this computed account of the loss
i upon the distilleries, an allowance (hoyld be
! made in Consideration of any increase of du
! ties upon beer which may have taken place
' within the fame period ; but what the a
â  mount of that allowance, may be, they do
not attempt to point out.âThus, fir, it is
I evident that they estimate a deficiency in one
instance with refpeft to the stoppage of the
distilleries, on the system of a computed
average, and rejedt any substitute for that
deficiency in the instance of the duties on
beer, which they clearly admit have increa
sed, but which they, do not think proper to
estimate by "comparing ft with the average
produce of other years, as they have done
in the cafe of distilleries. Let us for .a mo
ment take the average produce, of the beer
tax for the three preceding year?, 4nd we
Â« shall find, that there arises a sum of 270,000!.
in favor of last year, which has been entirely
overlooked in the report of the committee.
This sum, I therefore contend, ought to
have been added to the produce of the per
| irtiyient taxes. They have also, fir, stated
their estimate of the nav.y service for the en
suing year to amount to 12,935,0001. but
the right honorable gentleman differs in this
very material consideration from the com
mittee, and fixes ft at 12,66i,0001. to which
if we add, as we are jultified in doing, the
floating arrears of 1,500,0001. the estimate
will then appear to be 14,1 61 ,OQol. Thus
the right hon. gentleman, instead of making
his estimate, as he fays it is, lefsby 100,000
than that furnifhed by the committee, will in
faÂ£t make it greatly exceed that which we
find in the report. I wish to know, fir, on
what principle he has calculated the probable
increase of the navy debt for the ensuing
year. 111 my opinion'the best, and certainly
,jhe most fatisfactory way would be, to cal
culate it by the experience we have had of
the expences incurred in that department of
the public service during the last year. I
must observe, that in every estimate tif this
nature he has been always disappointed, and
the cause is obvious : he has continually act
ed on erroneous principles, and has therefore
been continually mistaken. What is the
line of conduit then which he should adopt ?
Why, fir, instead of confining himfelf to
narrow and circumscribed statements, instead
of implicitly regulating his judgment by the
standard of official accounts and trifling cal
culations, he ought to take matters on a
larger, and unquestionably a more secure ba
fi 3, since it is established by the experrrt-ce
of the past. Let us take a short view of the
effeft of those estimates on which he prides
himfelf. On the-7th of December, 1795,
the right hon. gentleman stated, that the
probable increase of the navy debt would be
2\ millions, and this he called a very ample
estimate. Then it arose to 4 millions ; then
to 7 millions ; and now, in the month of
April, which seems to be a fixed term for
bringing forward a second budget, he calls
for 8 millions more. The right hon. gen
tleman next tells us, that he lias all his do
cuments from the refpettivc offices ; and this
I believe to be true : but he ought to sup
pose an increase not merely from official pa
pers, but from the constant experience of
facts. The expences of the navy are at this
'ixioincnt on A much larger scale than any
time during the war. 190,000 men were
voted for the service of last year j we have
this year voted 12c,&00. Inftcud, therefore,
of making the iiicrcafc less than it was, he
should make it pioportionably greater, and
it ought to be 6 or 700,0001. mare than
what ft is now fixed at. With i"cfpe<St to
the army extraoi dinariea, the right lion, gen
tleman fays, they are included in the com
mon estimate, but. will he not admit that
many after payments have frequently taken
place ?â¢ Ar.d if so, is it not very likely that.
fuclt lApe.xej .will be :acu>rra on future
occafiona? I feel* my felt juÃlfiud in decla
ring from the various view j- which. I have
taken cf important fubjccls, tint ilot
wituftanduig'all the heavy burdens, Â£T.d all
the dreadful taxes we are about to'impofe
this day, we huve still one million more to
provide for the exigencies of the public frr
vice. On the fubjedt of affording pecuniary
succours to the emperor, tfie right hon. gen
tleman expresses his dtfire to have a certain
sum reserved for that purppfe, and in that
point I perfedly agree with him. YÂ«t}
what is not a little extraordinary, he wishes
to have 200,0001. voted as a loan to his im
perial majesty immediately ; nay, fir, if I
rightly underhand him, he wijhes to have
the measure agreed to this very night. I
hope the right hon.. gentleman will set me
right, if I have misconceived his intentipn, .
or if I mistake what I take to be a most
alarming proceeding (Mr. Pitt here fignified
his intention of moving the 200,0001. in tue
course of the night). Then, fir, I main
tain such a proceeding to be a diredl in
fringement of the declaration made by the
right honorable gentleman, that he wilhed
to have the pecuniary succour intended for
the emperor, reserved to a convenient op-
I will not pretend to fay how
far the credit of the country may be hurt by
the measure, but let me alk, is there any
mrvterialdifferencebet ween exporting 200,000
sterling, apd not receiving 200,0001. flerling
which this country was to receive ? Did
the right hon. gentleman speak of this ex
traordinary manner of paying the interest of
the loan, when he a(ked us to be security for
the house of Austria, and when he extolled
the good faith of the bank of Vienna ? But
having in compliance with his arguments
and entreaties guaranteed flie loan, he now
with lingular feeling laments, it is extremely
hard to think that the einperor could pay
I the interest, as he fays, to a day.âTo a
! day, fir ?âWith more propriety may the
| right hon. gentleman fay, it is hard to fup
i pose that the emperor can discharge it to a
| year, or to a far more distant time. But
when will it be paid ? The loan was made
to him in critical circumstances, and yet he
is not to pay the interest, because he is now
in critical cijrcumftances. There has not
been hitherto one shilling of the interest dis
charged and I fearthis country willevcrhave
'cause to repent lending money to the emperor.
The right hon. gentleman must be aware thatif
the in tcreft remains unpaid, he mufteome to the
Hoirfe'V.nd provide taxes for the sum guar
anteed by us to his Imperial Majesty, and
thus add, by more permanent taxes, to the
- burdens already too heavy to be borne.â
j With refpedl to the specious argument
which is held out that the restoration of
peace will, by restoring commerce to its
full extent, alio make the produce the
taxes more considerable ; I on the contrary
maintain that peace is much more likely to
diminilh than encreafe the amount of our
taxes. For when we look over our taxes,
we find upwards of of one million arising en
tirely from articles which could not be tax
ed m peace. I cannot agree that the state
of our manufaftures is more flourifhing than
; it was last year, for the assertion is positively
contradifted by the manufacturers. When
I the Right Hon. Gentleman last year propo-
I fed to lay a tax on landed and personal pro
j pertyy- he ilated the landed rent to amount
|to 25 millions sterling. I am, however, one
\ of those who think he undervalued it, but
; taking it at his own estimate, I feel myfelf
' juftified in faying, that when we have passed
; the taxes now proposed, and when, after
the winding up of the war, we come, to a
state of peace, we shall have a revenue equal
to our whole landed annual produft. We
are now Sir, at the end of April, and 18
millions are yet to be found. Three pay
ments have only been made on the Loyalty
Loan, and there are still seven tenths of it
to be made good, whichamount to 12,600,00 -
We are to rote 18 millions to day ; so that
between this day and the Ift of January
next, we have yet to find for the public ex
igencies, the enormous sum of 30,600,0001.
We have to furnifh in so short a space of
time as 35 weeks, 30,600,000. or, in other
words, almost one million per week, till the
end of the year. But, Sir, there is still a
npther point of view in which I vviih to
place this most serious and alarming consider
ation. In 1796, the new taxes only pro
dnced 3 millions. What then, Sir, is the
burden which the fubjeft has hitherto fc!t ?
The weight of that sum alone. But the tax
es to be imposed this day, with all the o
thers, will makÂ« 7 millions and a half. So
that we have actually felt only 3 millions ;
and, to ul" a favorite expression of Ministers
we have been as yet only scratched by the
war, for the people have not experienced
half the weight of the burthens imposed u
pon them, and which they must fuffer when
"they come to pay 7 millions and a half in
stead of three. That it is right and necessary
to look these dangers in the face, the right
honorable gentleman himfelf admits, though
he is by no means ready to pftnftife the the
ory which he proclaims. There still re
mains another article with respect to future
expenditure, to which I wish to direct the
attention of gentlemen. I mean, JSir, the.
Bills to be drawn this year, in St. Domingo,
on this country, probably to the amount of
900,0061. The bills drawn in" January a
mountcd to 700,0001. Whether-they have
been paid I cannot undertake to fay ; but if
half remains unpaid, and an additional sum
of 900,0001. is drawn for, I conceive it ve
ry difficult to find how the whole is to be
discharged. I do nof blame the Select
Committee for'proceeding .to their report on
the calculations laid before them, but I blame
both the Committee and the House Jfor not
grounding.their opinion on others that con
vey morj; fol'd information f I mean those
which are furniihed by experience. IÂ«n
fully fenfibleof the inestimable value bfpeace

adhering to equitable terms.

The Loaned/or of the Exchequer in reply to
the queltion put by Mr. Fox, said it was his in

porary loan to the Emperor of looyooo.
Mr. Grey combated several of the arguments
adduced by the Chancellor of the F.ichequer ;
he charged him with|being guilty of m'fiiemea
nor in diverting a parliamentary grant of last
session, to purposes different from that for which
it was voted ; ami ilated, that a sum amount

had been appropriated to other purpefes.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer defended
his condudt, and ihewed that the surplus dated
by the Ho,n. gentleman, had been brought to
account, and appropriated in the grants of the
present session.
Mr. Steele defended the Chancellor of the
Exchequer (relative to the appropriations of
the grant of 5,500,0001. of last year) from the
charges of Mr. Grey, whom he accused of pres
sing eagerly forward to notice on a point on
which he was not properly informed, and quo
ted* ths ait of parliament, in corroboration of
his assertion, that 1,054,0001. alluded to by-Mr.
Grey, was not included in that grant.
Mr. Grey, Mr. Fax, and Mr. Pitt, replied to
each other on this fubjeil.
Mr. Sheridan charged Mr. Pitt with misrep
resenting. his hon. friend (Mr. Grey)- after
which he Ilated his ofcjedtion to the proposed
taxes in general, none of which, he said, ex
cepting that of plate, met with his approba

LONDON, april 27.
. Mr. Pitt's Budget of the new Taxes
to pay the interest of the last Loan, as wel 1
as former deficiencies, is now before the
public, and we feel no. difficulty in observ
ing, that if no other Ways and Means can
be devised for paying it, there Will be a most
miserable deficiency indeed of the public
revenue.
A new tax of three-halfpe nee on every
Newspaper ! and an additional duty on ad
vertisements, the indefinite extent of which
we know only by the right hon. gentleman's
own words, to " amount in fami injlanccs to
pounds." We are loft in aftonifnment, at
who could be th'e advisers of such an'enor
mous and' impolitic tax, which mull dtSCat
the very purpose for which it was intended.
We cannot suppose that it is the wifli of the
Minister ro- ruin the property of those who
hav* raised a suppOrt for themselves and
their families at considerable expence, and
still Tore considerable labour and rilk ; such
an intention, we are sure, >s beneath hiscon
fideratlon ; and yet "we are at a loss to con
ceive, what dclu/ion could have prontpted
him to such a measure. We know very Well
that his enemies will fay of him, that this
tax is intehded as an attack 6n the Liberty
of the Press, and to confine the circulation
of knowledge ; there certainly is ground
for suspicion on this head, for the tax is a
complete prohibition oÂ£ the sale of News
paper:;. If the hon. gentle<nan had con
sulted the books of the Stamp Office, âhe
would have found, that the too .heavy duties
he ha's ulready imposed on Newspapers, have
not truth tended'to increase the Revenue ;
and if it.ha 3 done so in a trifling degree, it

CONGRESS.
HOUSE or REPRESENTATIVES,
Tpefday, fuso -Q.
(Concluded from yeflerday's Gazelle.)
Mr. SirjiKiriCK thought that by raising
| theje men, they would increase the danger which i
! they not/bed to avoid. 'They appreljended air,
attack from a foreign nation, and to guard
J againjl any pofjiblt injury they wert to go to
' expence, and by that means increase our nation
al debt, from -which he thought we had the
greatejl danger to fe&r, since they saw the
difficulty attending the raijing of any additional
Revenue. He called the attention of the house
to a Jituqiion of things not much unlike cur
own. The French nation had many regiments
on their fed coajl, and had been long making
preparations, as if with a view of invading
Great-Britain. In corfequence, the Britijh
have expended large funis in fortifying and
putting the island in a good Jlate of defence ;
and, though, perhaps the French never serious
ly intended to invade that country, yet the ap
pearance of it had probably occafwned greater
embarrassment, from causing these great ex
pences, and the consequent derangement of the
country, that if an invasion had really taken
place.
â¢ Mr. S. reprobated the idea of defending the
country againjl an invasion by two regiments of
artillery. The militia, he said, would be the
proper defence in such a cafe ; but he trufled
the commijftoners appointed for the puYpofe
would speedily fettle all differences betwixt the
two countries.
Mr. S. fpoie cf a veryfrious flatemcnt
which they had received the other day from the
secretary of the treasury, which did not stem
to call for additional expence, but for addition
al revenue. It appeared by that document that
there was due from the government to the bank
cf the United States, 4,750,000 dollars. Tet
they were told these expences mufl be gone into
and money borrowed whatever the interefl
might be. In common life, he believed, if a
man was prcjfed for money, it was accounted
a prudent thing for a man to retrench his cii*
pcnccs. He supposed the fame rule ought to
held good in refpeS to government.
But it was said, if theft men were not reiif
ed, privateers would come into cur ports, and
insult our citizens. Had there been any thing
during the present European â¢tear, which could
juflify such an apprehenfic K ? He thought not.'
He did not know a Jingle injlance of infill, I
except that of the Britijh ambajfador at R,hode
IJland, because some officers were not released.
sis to any invasion taking place, he had no idea
of it ; but if it wire to happen, militia would
bt the bejl defence and no expence would be in
curred, except there was a necejjity ; but if ar
tillerijls were raised the expence would be cer
tain.
Mr. Hartley was r.gaitifl J!riling out the
firjl feÃion ; for, though he did not think 950
additional artillery were necejfary, he thought
there was a necessity, for some, and also for an
increase of the infantry. He thought 4000
men necejfary for a peace eflablijhment, as it
would be very inconvenient to march militia
from one end of the Union to the ether. He
did not wijh to go into excefsj but be wijhed the
force to be efficient. He knew /here mujl he an'
increase of taxis ; he was for a land tax,
and wifhedto go immediately into it.
Mr.. BkooKF.s said, if he believed there
was no danger, heJhoufd agree with gentlemen
that there wou'd be no occajion for these men ;
but thinking our situation in no degree improv
ed by the fate events in Europe, he Jhoufd vote
for raijing the p'ropofed regiment, 7he oljit
tion ,of expence would go againjl tv.ry mea
sure. As there was no cert.iinty of otir am- I
baffadors being able 'to fettle our difyute with
France, they ought, he said, like wife mm,
to forefee, and prevent'l he evil". He w, s
afraid gentlemen were got into a . profound
fitep, and would nit wake till it was ton late.
Mr. S. Smith said that tht report from
the secretary of war had confirmed his opinion
.with rejpebl to fhis ntecfare, The .gcnjleman
from S. Carolina, hud fpakeii of a numl/sr of
forts which had been, thought- of in 1794, ut
which had f nce been given tip. With refpeS
13 non-commjjioticd officers which that gentle
man seemed fa think Jtiould be dedu&ed from
the number of men, they were the life of the
artillery service, and the musicians tvere si w.
To jhew that t&? present number as men would
be fufjicient, he slated the following as beinâ¢*
a proper number for ecch place, viz.. Wejl
Point Co, New-Tcrk 60, Mud-IJland 60,
Baltimore 50, Norfolk-so, Wilmington JN
C. 30, Charljlon 60, Savannah 30, New
par: Co, Portland 30, Portsmouth 30, Point
Petre (Georgia) 30, W.Jlern Pep 412 â
Total 992.JlJr. S.actujed the gcnthtr.rn freiti S. Co* *
ralitta VJitb â¢whul'ing and turning bis arguments
into every frffille form ; liit hi was certain
â  nct<withjli:riding <wbat the gentlemen had said ;
to th( contrary, that the present men were equal
to all thefer'oice they had to perform. 11eji- !
Tuvcd there were militia tvelt trained to the use ;
of artillery ; there were two companies at Bal
timore ; one he had with him on the ivejlern 1
. cr.ptda'uir, ; he believed the miliiia at Charlrjlon
was equaMy welt tra 'rr.td. He lutfbed the sub.
j.-{! to be pnflpaned till the next fejjim.
Mr. Cll f.S â¢was riot of opinion with the
gcallman from â South-Carolina, that because
iht president and secretary of war, had recom
mendatl tie- raijing of these men, they fhouli a-
AÂ°pt the plait ; indeed the senate proposed to
raise only half of what the secretary recom
no-tided. He trujkd they Jhould think for
themfela.es.
A'(. C. did not think the flrength of the eoun
fry depended on 4000 artil.'jry ; he looked upon
mi!it-try eflablifhments as a fort of faftitious
ftrargtb, but upon the militia as the realftrfgth
of the nation. He thought the expence a f rious
ilk {lion. It appeared our eflablfhment bad
already cojl us eight millions of dollars, and he
teuld not fie vjbere they had donefervice to that
amount ; be therefore thought it a bad bargain
The gtnlUmanJrom New-York, had charged
the hrnfc with being a/leep. He believed that
could not be the pnfe, at it would be a difficult
mutter indeed to sleep where he wa>. It had
beenfeid additional revenue iJauld be wanted,
whether this bill fhff.lt or not. Suppcfe ths
, -were so, it was fttre'.y no reason for pafjing a
bill which might be thonght unnecefjary
Mr. Breokes exclaimed.
Dir. Dayton [the Speaker) did not know til!
be heard the gentleman ft cm New-York fayfo,
that new fortifications were contemplated; be
sup! ofed the money apprcpt iatid was for comple
ting :hofe already begun.
With riff eel to the propriety of this fneafure;
he bad always been in the habit of diflrujling
his own judgment, whenit differed from that of
â the President and Senate; his firjl jmprefjions '
therefore in favour of the measure, but
the more he had confidtred it, ike mote these
imprefflons were effaced. Mr. I), said, if the
fubjstf waj before thent, he should rather be in
favour of inereafing the number of infantry
than of the artillery. He thought the heft wny
of making the increase, would be to add to each
company one officer, two non-cÂ»mmiffior.cd offi
cers arid ten or twelve privates.
The gentleman from New-York had said he
should agree to the proportion, because he thought
the country in danger. Mr. D. thought the bet
ter way wou'd be, if this.were really the cife,
tcfill our arsenals with arms, our magazines
with tmmunitioa, and our treasury with money,
lie agreed with ihe gentleman from Maryland
that we had artillery 'enoughfor 8, io, or 12,000
men. Artillery, be said, could not do the ser
vice of infantry ; their difeipline was very dif
ferent ; they do not work up u rt fortifications,
but merely guard the guns, isfc. He wished
they had bad a. view of the iufantry stifo ; if
they had not been fufficient, be should not objtS
to the increaftng if them ; but be could fee no
propriety in increasing the artillery.
Mr: Hartley thought the men to be raised
might be made to serve as artillery or infantry
as they might be wanted. He believed half the
number proposed would be fuffcient.
Mr. Shepard was in favor of the plan fug
geficd by the gentleman from New-Jersey.
Mr. Potter hoed the feftion .would be ft ruck
out. If the proposed addition to our artillery '
was meant as a peace efiablifhment, they were i
not wanted ; and if they were to be raised with
a view to war, they would be incompetent. He
thought 40 men might be fparcd f rom Philadel
phia, and 50 from Weft Point, for Rhode-Ifl'
and, which at present \*as entirely without
any-
Air. E'.mondorf -was in favour ofjinking out the fic
tion. He thought it vias proper to enquire ivbct tvas the
natural it fence of the country, and-what -were the measure/
proper to Lt talttn fur that pnrpofe. He be'ieved the object
of the pref.nt bill had no relation to it. Tha be/I ivay
â¢would difcharge our debt, in the nextplaoe tofortify,
and providefufftcient arms and ammunition , the militia al
so fbou'dte well organized and disciplined, and they fh'juld
attend to ueonomy in the expenditure of public money.
the queCdon f/r.ftriiing out thejeition was Out and
carried, there being 56 votes in favor of it.
The committee refe and the bouse -were about te take the

By a report of the fecrÂ«taryof the treasury

dollars, 4 cents; and the expenditure in the
fame period 8,728.473 dollars 50 cents ;

LONDON, April 29.
The following letter was received this morning
from corrvfpondcnt at
Dover, April 18."
" A person belonging to tliis town Was landed
this clay trom a vciTel which left Kuiul.uivh 1-ii
Sunday. He brings an account that a mt'lieiigcr
h.dariived therefrom Vienna in five days, with
an account of sonic great advantages g*i!>ed by
the Aurtriaus ovt r the French, but had not time to
learn the particulars."
If this information liecorrefl, the above meffen-.
ger must have left Vienna nvi days later than the
â  date of the intelligence from that capital, received
by (hi mail yesterday.
Fiivate letters received yesterday by the
Htmbutg mail, brought intelligence that gen
eral Buonaparte w.is certainly empowered by
the French Dlieftury, to offer ultimately furh
terms 'o the Emperor as may lead to a gen
eral pacification Â£Sun.
Lord Bridport failed yesterday morning
from St. Helen's with the fleet under
commandâThe wind, however, changing
in the course of the day, the fleet was oblig
ed to put back to St. Helen'sâThree of
the (hips at PortsmoUth, the Marlborough,
Minotaur and Ramilis., persist in demanding
that their particular grievances be redressed.
They have not yet lifted their anchors. The
reft of the fleet, however, take no part with
them.
May 5.
Stocks experienced a further depreciation
yesterday. Consols were down so low as
48 âImperial three per cents, at 44 âand
the new Loan at three fourths premium.
Mr. Hammond was not expedted to reach
Vienna until the 30th of April, 13 days.af
ther the signing of the preliminaries of a se
parate peace.
Saturday, May 6.
The Hamburgh mail due on Wednesday
last arrived this day at noon. -Tie Vienna
Court Gazette of the 19th does not mention
the signing of the Preliminaries of Peace;
but only the prolongation of the Armistice
between the Archduke Charles and General
Buonaparte to the 20th; but letters from
several parts of Germany ftaie, that the Pre
liminaries of Peace were signed at the head
quarters of General Buonaparte on the
18th.
The Nuremburgh Gazette of the Z2d ult.
contains the following article.
" Yesterday the 21ft, at seven in the even
ing, a courier palled through this town,
with intelligence that Peace was concluded,
and signed on the 18th at Goiflern in Upper 1
Styria."
None of the Foreign Papers make any
mention of the conditions.
We communicated to the public, in part
of our Impression yesterday, that govern
ment had received dispatches from Vienna,
with an account of the signing of the Preli
minaries of Peach on the 18th ult. between
the French Repubjic and the Emperor. A
copy of these Preliminaries has not yet arri-
the messenger having set out from Vi
enna immediately after they were received by
the Austrian Cabinet. They contain how
ever, the leading principles upon which the
separate Peace between the Republic and
Emperor is to be negociated. The Nether
lands of course are given up and the French
Republic extends itfelfto the Rhire.
The concerns of the Members of the Ger
manic Empire who are at War with France,
or who have been deprived of territorial pof
fefllons by making the Rhine the Borndary
of the Republic, are to be discussed and de
cided upon in a Congress to be held at Bade
to which it is stipulated Great Britain may
fend a minister with powers to negociate a
general Peace. A Cessation of hostilities
on the continent has been agreed upon ;
dnd we (hould now indulge the fond hope
that the blessings of peace would soon be re
stored to Great Britain, if we had the hap
piness to have any other administration than
the present; but under such Ministers can
expectations be sanguine? Can we rationally
hope that they who entered into the War so
rashly, will even now be eager to make
Pwce? or can we believe that men who
have condu&ed the Warfo difgracefully,
will be able to terminate it honorably? It is
under such men that the sentiments of the
French towards the Englilh Government
have assumed, a character and complexion
which is horribly described in the Grondeur
of the 28th ult, a paper attached to the Di
rectory, and elteemed to be one of the molt
moderate,
All the accounts from Vienna represent
the alarm that prevailed there before the
15going of the Preliminaries to have been ex
treme. The Head quarters of the Republi
can army were but 8 pods from Vienna.
Most of the Royal Family had fled. The
Ambassadors had made preparations for their
departure,at a moment's notice, The Ar
chives, Chancery, &c. had been packed up
and sent off and many of the Nobles and
men of property had taken flight with their
most valuable effects.
PARIS, April 27.
Accounts â¦rom Turin and Bade agree in
dating that subsequent to the expiration of
the armistice on the )ft irift. a bloody and
decisive engagement had taken p'-ce. It
appears, that on the fourth day after the
jfufpjiifion of hostilities, the-archduke re
queued a prolongation of the.armiitice, which
w-m rt-fufed, and that-he a&udly made such
difpofitious of his army -as he-thought belt
calculated to surround. Buonaparte. The
French general, however, thefe
hostile movements and adopted mtafures to
fru(lrate his objeft. At the moment the
truce expired, he attacked the archduke
on all points and routed him completely.
Never did the army of Italy fight with lb
much erithufiafm and intrepidity.âlt is ob
vious that it was in eonfequence of this de
feat, that the Auftriangenerals solicited the
second armistice, which was followed by the
figniug of the preliminaries fcf peace.
It is said, that Buonaparte, wltoisufually
of a serious turn, was cn thin occaiion ex
tremely cheerful and communicative.
April 28.
It was a large house, very well known in
Paris, where all the reports of the defeat of
citizens of Bergamo by the mercenaries of
the Venetian nobility, were manufactured
for insertion in certain Journals. Up to the
latest date of these fabrications, no battle,
we are allured, had taken place. One, how
ever, happened soon after, but the result
was different to the reports. The inhabi
tants of Bergamo defeated the (laves of Ve
nice. All the French have quitted that
city where they had been treated with so
much indignity and outrage.
Buonaparte loft no time to notice the
execrable proclamation inserted in one of
their recent publications. He immediately
wrote to the senate of Venice, allowing
them twelve hours to mak,e reparation.
In reply, the Venetian nobility gave their
Haves direÂ£tions to massacre all the "French
who were lick or wounded in the hospitals
of Verona and Salo. It was necessary .to
acquaint the commander in chief of these
tranfa&ions, and wait for his orders. Kil
maine was directed to make an example
which will leave a deep impression. He put
himfelf at the head of a chosen body of men,
and it is conjeftured that Verona and Salo
are i) 6 more.
Came passengers in .the brig Orion, cap
tain Shaw, the reverend Dr. Burke, Mr.
Maffey, Mr. Harrifon, Mr. English, Miss
Canty, and Miss Connorâand 34 steerage
paflengers ; who, penetrated with the deep
est sense of gratitude to captain Shaw, for
his polite and generous treatment during the
think it would be injustice to with
hold their unanimous thanks.
BALTIMORE, JUNE 2c.
Extra ft of a letter from a gentleman tn^Anna
polis, to his friend in this city, dated the 19th
injlant.
" Snatched from the jaws of death, I has
ten to inform you of my escape. On Sa
turday I embarked from Kent Illand in the
belt ferry boat. About a mile and an half
from the western (hore: we were overtaken
by the molt violent wind which this country
every experienced. We saw it for several
miles tearing up trees, crufiling houses, and
feattering limbs in the air. We immedi
ately prepared to encounter this dreadful
tornado ; lowered every inch of fail, and
put the vessel's head to the wind ; but in
vain . The storm no sooner struck her, â
than she began to heel, and never recovered
in the smallest degree. I stood at the hatch
till the ballast fhifted, and the water poured
.into the hold, endeavoring to cut away the
sore-mast, in 3 moment the mails were under
water ; scrambled upon the bottom, and
continued there for about a minute ; but
not feeing the ferry men, and finding the
veflel was linking, I hurried back to the
gunwale, there I discovered Tom in the
molt diltrefling lituation. I gaveliim all
the afiiftance in my power, but the veflel
was now finking so rapidly, that all hope
seemed to vanilh. I held with two fingers
in the scupper, until that part dragged me
two feet under water. I then put my feet
against the deck, and with one violent exer
tion, made stir the main-mast ; but that in
stant a wave overwhelmed me, and I seemed
to link to rife no more. Fortitude, howe
ver, had not yet forfaken me ; I made one
attempt to <rife to the top of the waves,
land succeeded. I then fortunately laid hold
of the hatch, which was floating near me.
I then struggled for and caught hold of the
malt, where for 15 or 20 minutes, every
wave went at least fix feet over my head.
However, the storm subsided, and I am on
shore, but much bruised and debilitated by
the accident. Five other vefltk were over
set in fight of us, but I hear of no lives loft,
I am in too much pain to -be more particu
lar."

FEAST OF REASON.
Yesterday an entertainment wac
; given to Gen. MARSHALL at the Eagle
i Tavern, by a number of the most refpeftj
[ blp citizensof this cityand its vicinity. The
j principle which a&uated this pttblic display
of civic fcltiva!, was not only to express one
approbation of the choice of the President in
our worthy fellow-citizen} but to evince
our most ardent desire of a happy reconcilia
tion of the difference which at present Un
hapily exists between our lifter republic and
the United States.
Among the company we fibferved his ex-'
cellcncy the Governor, the Attorney gene
ral, several members of the Executive coun
cil, of the afTembly, &c. other citizers
of diftinfiion. The feftival was closed with
the utmost hilarity, a number of patiiotij
toasts were given ; and when "success to thâ¢
embassy ofGeneral MARSHALL" was drank
the tears of affeftion flowed from the patri
otic eye of every true friend to the real inter
est and happiness of his country. In faft,
the whole entertainment fully displayed the"
FEAST 1 OF REASON and the FLOW OF SOUL.
We understand that general Ma'rlhatt will

STAGES.
THE public are requested to take notice, that
the partnership which has for some time sub
sisted between Mathias Slough of Lancaster, and
William Geer, is jiow diflolved : but, not as M.
Slough insinuates to the public without just cause ;
as will more fully appear by a letter on the fub
jed from M. Slough to W. Geer, dated the 29th
December 1 a ft. a recitai of which Ls Hot nÂ©w deem
ed neqefTary. Any gentleman who wishes to be
more circumstantially informed of the merits of
this bulinefs, .by applying to W. Geer may have
the perusal Â«f M. Slough's letter," and then can be
at full liberty to determine whether or not W.
Geer is not perfedlly juftifiable in attaching him
felf to any other pei-fon in the prosecution of the
Stage conveyance from Philadelphia to Shippenf-
Krg, or any other place.
Now from the liberal and generous support the
public were pleased to confer on the firft effort in
this buGncfs, Vf illiam Geer, in conjun<flion with
Messrs. Reily, Weed and Witmer, is determined
to prosecute and carry it on, with every care, at
tention and fllifpatch that a zeal to oblige the pub
lic can poflibly exert.
The above company, who are amply provided
with carriages, horses, and every appurtenance to
render the passage fafe and commodious, inform
thof# wno wifti to patronize and encourage the
undertaking, that they can take their feats at
George Weed's, the sign of the White Horse, '

i. trcaty.of amity, commerce and navigation, ex
cluded befween hit Britannic majesty and the United
r States of America, on the 19th day of November,
J 794, having this day constituted their Board,
pursuant and agreeably to the said treaty, do here
t by give notice, that they are ready to proceed to
e bufmÂ«f* accordingly; and they desire that all clafnis
under the laid article (which so far as the fame de
fences the cases thereby provided for, it hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
They farther desire that all fueh claims may not
on'y ftatc in -.vlut manner the; fcveral cases eome
within the defeription of the said article, but also
specially set forth -he nature of the evidence by
1 which the claimantsrefpeiively undertake tofub
â¢ Itantiate the lame.
ExtraS from the said article,
" Whereas itis alledged by divers British mer
" chants, and others his, nvjefty's fuhjtiSs, that
" debts to a confid-rahls araoumt, which iverc bona
" fide contracted, before the peace, still' remain
â¢ " owing to them by citizensor inhabitant's of the
" United States; qnd that by the operation of va
" riotis lawful impediments, since the peace, not
5 " otjy the fuil recovery of the said -debts has been"
" delayed, but #lfo the value and security thereof
" have been in several instances impaired and Icff
" ened, so that by tlÂ»e ordinary course of juiicil!
" proceedings, the British creditors cannot now
" obtain and actually have and receive full ani
" adequate compensation for the lofln and dama
" ges which tney have thereby sustained: It is a
" greed that in all such cases where full compenfa
" tion for such losses and damages cannot for what
" ever reason be a&ujlly attained, had and recei-i
" ved by the said creditors in the ordinary course
" of justice, the United States will make full and
" complete compensation for the fame to the said
" creditors; but it is diftin<9.ly understood, that
" this provision is to extend to such losses only as
" have been occasioned by the lawful impediments
" aforefaid, and is not to extend to losses occasion
" ed by such insolvency of the debtors or other
" causes, as would equally have operated to pro
" duce such loss, if the said impediments had not
" existed ; nor to such losses or damages as have
been occasioned by the manileft delay, ornegli
'â¢ t>encc, or wilful omifiion of the claimant."
