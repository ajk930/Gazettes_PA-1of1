HAPPT DISCOVERY.
A certain Cure for that alarming and dreadful Diferder
| The Yellow Fever,
1 As tvell as any other dangerous putrid fever, fever and
ague, and other inveterate and complicated difeafis, by
e d)e use of the
POUDRE UNIQUE,
WELL known and patented in England, France,
Poland, and all the capital cities in Europe,
where the most aftonilhing cure? have been effoA
cd on.persons judged iwcufable by all physician*.
In a Treatise printed in London, on the properties
of this powder, by T. Seymour, M. D iare Che
mifl to his Majefly, there arc* stated t\\'Q hundred
cases, where this most valuable remedy has proved
infallible, in all tind of fevers, pleurisy, bljcdy Jlux t
n inverse rheumatics, fdatica, apoplexy, pat al\fie, yel
low jaundice, ringworm, worms if children and in gronn
q p er f 9ns Â» whites, chronical bead and fomach aches, hepa -
tick and ncphretical or Jlone clulic, the lings evil, furvy
and the mo(i inveterate and complicated venereal disease. It
is likewise the best preparative for the small pox
andmeafleg; ol the greafeft utility for young aa
,e well as for elder ladies at the critical epoch of their
g life. Ihe efficacy of this powder in iiveral of the
c- 'above diseases has been dilcovered by chance, and
so it has been in the yellow fever last year, by Mr*
Mahy, who cured fsveral by ad mini fieri riÂ£ only
two of the said powders, and loft not a Tingle pa
tient which he undertook to cure, as proved
artefted by the here annexed certificates, whose ori
ginal may be seen at Andrew Hadfegs umbrella Jbop %
Â»n AY 131, corner of Chefnut and fuurtbfl recti, the on
u. ly place where these powders are to ba had, with
IV proper diredions for the use of them.âPrice tut
M'ari.
es The ufefulnefs and certainty of this remedy be- I
ing so great for so many dangerous disorders, any
person wishing toJ>e provided with those powdei s,
will pleafc to apply vctj soon, as the quantity at
hand is rot very large, and it is doubtful if for 4
lsng time, or if ever any other genuine will be im
ported, the f-cret remaining only ifl the hand, of
the inventor, in Europe, and never being commu-
nicated to, or discovered by any othar perfom
or N. Bln the yellow and putrid fevers, this pow
der null betaken thÂ« iecond, or at It.allthe tliiid
day.

j'. 1 e PS ,lon of the pril'oner were found â¢
divers papers, one in particular, purport- '
lug to be a return of men, arms and ammu
Mtion, in the hand-writing of the prisoner; a
this paper, though written with obfeurity,
might eahly be usdtrftood. Another pa 1
of per found on the person of a Mr. Lynch, v

tiie hand-writing of the prisoner, would alp
so be produced ; it purported'to be an ad- t
<ne dress irom the delegates of the coun'y of f
W tcklow to their conftiiuents, and was, he
conceived, in itfelf, full proof of the guilt r
of the prisoner ; it stated that the most'
flattering accounts were Alertly expefted d
from abroad (this, the prime ferjeaht.ob- -j
served, must menn France) which would in
a few days be officially notified to them r [â 
it stated, that by the lalt provincial returns, d
the increase of United lirilhmcn appeared t ,
_ to be only a few thousands ; but accounted c
a . for thisâit begged of them so pay no at
d, tention to the flying rumorj of the day ; a,s f
re it stated, the emiflarifcs of government were (
t e bofy ill circulating falfhoods, and Jfpwing t
in the feeds of disunion among United Irilli- â
men. It stated that theba ony of New
castle had complaised of not being yet sup- a
plied with arms ; that great numbers ef 0
pikes were ready for delivery ; and it re- Â«
( commended to the people to be indefatiga
)- ble in forming more ; it complaioed of the n
apathy of part the cdunly of Wicklow. s
' c which had refufed tocont'ibate id per head 3
j for the relief of the fnffering patriots in the tc
,Â« several goals, but who disdained the horrid ; s
crime of bartering for their liberty by turn- t f
ing informers ; it stated that there was no t }
- ftwd for relieving 4.2 persons now confined ol
in Wicklow, and that 181. had been ad- di
. . vanced by one individual ; it recommended b<
' an immediate voluntary contribution to af
>_ fid those men ; it particularly called their r ;
attention 10 a meeting fhortl> to take piace, p,
. wherein business of the firft confequercc C c

It then proceeded to enumerate several 0 r

, which in no decree dimimflied his affeftion
. - for his other parent, to fuppiy w h o f c wants
f he often deuicd himfelf the ueceffaries of

; College des Profits, at Paris, in quality of
Bur/or*, aad was kfiown tltere by his chrif
. ti-.'i name of Nicholas. Nothing, during
the ti*9 firft y ears, announced extraordinary
talents ; but in tne third, out of five prizes
that were distributed annually, he bore away
â  lour, failing in latin verses alone. The
next year his success was complete; and he
made a remark upon the occsfion, which
difoovered good talte, a superior mind, and
the opinion he Ventertm'ned of the judges:
" I lolt the prize last year (&id he) becaufr
I imitated Virgil ; this ye r I obtained itÂ»
because I took Buchanan, Sarbievius, and
other moderns, for my guides."
In Greek he made a rapid progress ; but
his petulance, his wit, and his waggifli tricks
threw the class into so much disorder, that
he was expelled from it by Mr. I.obtain
tlie profefUjr of that language ; and not long
after left the college altogether. Thrown
upon the wide wo:Id, without friends ot
any means of flipport-, he was focn
to the lowelt pitch of povetty. He bore?
his misfoi tunes-, however, with philosophic
p>{ience, and cheered himfelf with the most
flatterLng hopes : " I am a poqr devil now,'* -
laid he to Self 3, anotiier man of letteri s
"but do you know what will happen? I fhalt

world, and by the great, whom
I defpile: tliey will ms!te my fortime for
too, alid I shall afterwarda liyc like a philu

Tint meteor that rife in the French revolu- |
tion, rushed through the piUtical fyftetn like a ]
fcomet ; and disappeared in the midii of the long
turprife awl uncaly admiration it excited âMi- (
raheau, in short, was the liriend of Chamfort,
am' often borrowed his pen. The most eloquent
pafoges in the letters 01 the order ofCir.cinnatus 1
belong to the litter. He was indeed, his conn- 1
â  fel upon all occasions.; and when Mirabeau went t
to pass an hour with him, as wa3 hisctiftom in ,
ihe morning, he used to call it going to rub the. j
most eleiSrical head he.had ever met with.
The light emitted by this e'eftrical head (
could not fail to fhirce in fippofinon to the
blading rays of\he mock fun of libertyâof '
the felon Robcfpierre â o whom talents and f
virtue were alike obnoxious.
It was difficult, however, to lay hold on
Chamfort. Frank, upright, decided and j
independent of all parties, he had iteered a '
steady course through the revolutionary
ilorm ; openly proftffi'ig an equ4 hatred of
pr-elts and nobles, and of Marat and the ;
reft of Ihe meo of blood. At the fame j
time that he was author of the faying,
" Guerre aux chateaux, paix aux chau
mieres*," he explained by the appellation
of the fraternity if Cain and /Ibethe com-
pulfive fvftem of fraternization, deviled by f
the jacobin club. _ l
At length, however, an obfeure informer
was found to denonnce him, Rnd Chamiort
was carried to the-Madelonnettert UriaMe
to obtain there the attentions, and the occa-
lional folitnde that some habitual infirmities
imperiously required, h â¢ conceived so pro
found a horror of imprisonment. that when
,he was fuffered to return, a few days after,
to his apartments, under the cu(tody of a
guard, he swore he would ratfier die than
be immured anew.
In little more than a month, the gen
darme told him he had orders to carry him
back to a hÂ«ufe of confinemest.âCham- "
fort retired to a closet, under the pretence .
of making his preparations ; fired a pistol Ir
at his head j shattered the bones of his
nose ; and drove in his right eye. Aflon- 1
ifhed at finding himfelf alive, and resolved 1 .
to die, he took up a razor, tried to cut his
throat, and mangled the flefh in the most r '
dreadful manner. The weakness of his a
hand made no change in the resolution of w
his mind : he attempted fevesal times, id Â®
vain, to reach his heart with the fame in-
ftrument-; and finding himfelf begin to , L
faint, made a last effort to open the veins at ,n
his knees. At length, overcome by pain, _
he uttered a loud cry, and fell almost life
kfs into a chair. |
T*hcr door "WasTirokcii "open","ants furgeonj
atid civil olHcers soon repaired to the spot. c .
While the former were preparing dressing* g
for so many wounds, Chamfort di&ated to
the la'tcr, the following truly Roman decla- -k
ration: "I, Sebastian Roch Nicholas Cham- ci
f"rt, declare it was my intention to die a t r
freeman, rather than to be carried back, like
a to a house of confinement. I de- j
clare, moreover that if violence be used to 2
carry me thither in the slate lam in, I have A"
ftill-flrength enough to fini(h what I have h;
begun." i b ,
Ah hour or two -after he became perfectly
calm, and resumed his usual ironical man-1
ner. ' See what it is (f.iid he) to want j ta
dexterity ; an awkward man cannot kill : tc
liimftlf." He then Went on to relate how j Q
he hadperfot ated his eye, and the lower part : q
of his forehead, inllead of blowing out his j
J brains; /cored his throat, instead of cutting 01
it ; fcartfied his breast, without reaching his al
heart. Â«' At last (added he) I recollefted fg
Seneca ; and in honour of Seneca, I resolved
to open my v. ins; but Seneca was a rich
man ; he had 1 warm bath, and every thing a!
to his wifii: lam a poor miftrab'e devil, w
and have none of the fame advantages; I oi
trcve hurt niyfelf horribly, and here I am' jjj
Not one of the multitude of wounds he al
had * lade was mortal Strange a3 it may h'
zpptar, they were even attended by beneii- CC
ti j' confrqucncea. By giving vent to an
internal humour that had long preyed upon â¢
his cilitftitution, they reftorcd him to a (late
of health he had beÂ«n 3 llranger to for years; * 0
and Cha'infort now have been alive, ti l
if, when his wounds were closed, the fur- ut
geons had given iftne to that humour by i r

1 This morning arrived in town, the v
chief who unites all hearts. He left t
Spurrier's pretty early, and lighted at '
. Brydcn's about 8 o'clock, escorted in by
1- captains Hollingworth's and Bentalou's j

e . that purpose. About 10, the sth and '
0 2 7th regiments (as many as from the '

e , had the gratification of being reviewed j
by him, in Market-street, much to the t

t i tators, who thronged around him, again
II jto behold the venerable Cincinnatus, and '
v i Commander in Chief of America. The

g City Coinpany, Captain Harris, waited c
j on the General at his quarters, person-
s ally to congratulate him on once more j
1 Teeing him among them in health, and {
j* made open ranks for hint to pass through 3
as he came Â«ut to review the troops. He
i, was accompanied as he marched in front

th': former insurance was made ; but the paymmt
of the premium is efiential to such renewal ; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time; nor can the insurance be renew
