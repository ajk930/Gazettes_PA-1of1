. Mr. Gilbert, said, he should not then have risen
again on the motion for the committee'* rising, had
it not been fÂ»r the extraordinary observations just
made from thÂ« honoorable gentleman from New-
Jersey. Mr. Gilbert faidyhe had never boasted of
the wealth of New-York, or made, or noticed, any
remarks like those imputed by the honorable gen
tlemanâthat he was .at 2 loss to fee, how that gen T
tleman's observations were applicable to the mat
ter under consideration, or indeed, admiflible on the
lt . ground of proprietyâtl.ey seemed to him, he said,
to contain such insinuation, such implications, as he
was furpriled to hear advanced from so enlightened
a quarter. What state in the union, Mr. G. asked,
had not acted upon the fame principles relative to
property and jurifdiftion, with New-York ? Had
not, he said, every fovereigu state done the fame ?
And had not New-Jersey done the fame ? Has not
New.Jerfcy exclusively exereifed and claimed to
herfelf the benefit of all a&s of confiscation and
disposition of property within its jurifdi&ional com
pass ? And what state had ever ceded these things
to the union, or (liared the right with others ? Why
then, should fueh things be mentioned as (ingularly
e> a pplying to New-York ? As te her back unappro
be Pasted wild lands, Mr. G. said, it was well known,
that one of the principal creditor states (Maffachu-,
setts) had fully and, equally participated in the
wliole of them. But, said Mr. G. what has the
comparative indigence, or wealth of the states, to
do with the fubjeft of cenfideratien ? Because
j r New-York might be considered wealthy, he did
id no * it would therefore be considered that
Hie should payânor did he know how the gentle
t- man from New-Jersey would take it for granted
(he said) that the balance Handing against New-
York, was the result of a just fettlemcnt, and in
fact, a righteous demand. . He said, there could
not be a gentleman present, acquainted with that
buliuefs, who could, in liisfoul, believe it, especially
when he peiceived the immense sum rendered a
gainst. that state, far exceeding the balances against
all the other states united. In order, however, to
have a fair inquiry into that fubjeft, he really hoped
tj the committee would then rife.
Mr. Holland hoped, from the commencement
of this debate, that it would have been conduced
with temper and moderation ; but the gentleman
from New-Jersey (Mr. Dayton) had implicated all
the states which were reported to be debtor states.
Mr. H. said there was juftire in tbofe states; but
when it was generally believed that improper and
fraudulent charges had been admitted by theccm
miflioners. was it not to be expedted that there
would be a desire ia them to have a review of the
â  settlement ? He was confident whenever the debtor
e states should be convinced that the demands were
just, they would open their funds and pay them,
r but not before.
Mr. Dayton (the speaker) rose to give a short
t anfwei- to the members from North-Carolina and
New-York, who had commented upon his obfer
-1 vations. The former gentleman had insinuated
that those who advocated the motion had done it
> with intemperance bordering on indecorum, but
Mr. Dayton was happy to find that no expression
of his had been pointed out, which might be con
, ftrued into a violation of the ftridteft rides of deco
-1 rum and good order, unless indeed for him to fay
(hat certain Rates were debtors of the United
States, and that they ought to be required to pay
what they owed, could be liable to that conftrufti
, on. The member from New-York had affe&ed to
mifunderfland him when he spoke of their having
withheld from the other states and appropriated to
their own use that immense mass of property which
had been acquired in the course of the war with
Great- Britain and their allies, from the savages, at
the common expence, and bythe common exertion
of the force* of the United States. He fuppwed
that every member who heard him mtift have known 1
that he did not allude to petty confifeations, but to 1
those vast trails of land called vacant or crown
lands, in theconqueft of which every regiment be- J
longing to New Jtrfey as well as to other states '
were employed. New-York had beea willing that 1
thf union should participate with them in the ex- '
pence an<l danger of the conquest, but, after it 1
was efFeÂ£ted, they had refufed any (hare of the be- 1
nefits, and thus by means of this and other spoils
had enriched their treasury. t
Mr. Gilbert laid, it would feern by the obferva '
tione of the gentleman from New-Jersey, that the 1
conduA of the state of New-York was fmgular 1
with refpe& to their having fold their vacant lands. *â 
He would aJk if there was a state in the union 1
which had vacant land, which had not done the '
fame thing ? Had any such state ftiared its land
with the union i Certainly not, and he could fee 1
no propriety in the charge against New-York. !l
Mr. W. Smith wiftied to observe in reference to e
what had fallen from the gentleman from New- '
York (Mr. Livingfton) refpefting that state not Â®
being bound by the decilion of commiflioncrs be- ''
cause the state had not coafented to the settlement. '
He would remark, that befidcs the co-operation of w
the teprefentatives of that state, they appointed an P
j agent to bring forward their claims which certain- ''
ly shewed their acquiescence to the proceeding. u
M. S. said he was surprised to hear gentlemen dwell "
so much upon the injustice of the proceedings of M
the cornmiffioners, and upon the improper claims
ndmitted, fincc lie did not know how they could
have come at their knowledge on the fubjeft, since .
those proceedings had never been made public. ~
With refpeft to the unfortunate frigate which had
been alluded to by the gentleman from New-York,
he cculd fay that the state ot S. Carolina was then Â»e
paymg-for that frigate, and that it was not charg- Io
ed to the United States as had been insinuated.
The committee rose, and on leave being asked r f
to fit again. ro
Mr. Harper hoped leave would net be given.â J t
â  He would not repeat reasons fat wifliing this, as he
had already laid them before the committee of the
whole.
Mr. Baldwin relied upon it that leave would be
given for the committee to fit again. It would be
in 1 fa& to purfuethe idea whiob-rhe gentleman him
jl felf had lately exprefled. The resolution under
n Consideration is commencing the negociation with
the dates which he had lecommended. Mr. B. ex
prefled great confidence that nothing would be ne
â  n Ceflary but t* commence this negociation, and that
id tfce states would at least discover a fatisfa&ory dif
ift position. If it was true, as had been contended
ir. by lnmc members, that tlÂ»e general board of com
of miffioners had conduced the business tjadly, or
ty that they were wicked or currupted, or if it fhouW
n- be thought by the dates that they ha 4 proved
B . themselves unequal to the vork, as some seemed to
t. suppose, which would set aside their award, the
)e sooner it is known the better, that msafures may
be taken to form a new board and begin the matter
le anew. He persuaded himfelf when they commu
?d aicated with the ftatcs, it would be found there was
j t not one which would desire such a measure. When
0 he recalled the recolle&ion of the manner ia which
id the whole war.had been carried on without any rule
J of apportionment or any settlement of accounts be
it tween the states, and the ill-humour which had
.o grown out of it, canftantly aggravated by the yearly
d calls on the flares for monies to support the old
I. union, he was sure tfiat no perfoii who was a wit
rj ness to the tranfa&ions of those times, would have
y a W 'H' to fee them repeated. The amount was so
y K reat i an d the whole so perplexed, as well as irri
tating, that the frien Â«Js to the peace and union of J
the couatry have perhaps never experienced so criti
j. cal and anxious a period. The to
e bring forward their own Hate's claim, warmed by
e IoÂ»al zeal and private intcred, and the councils of
ci 'he union were for years agitated by the violeace
Â° c and passions of parties fettling their own old dif
d puted accounts. Experience seemed to have con
j vinced evcty body, that no settlement could ever be
i. made in that way, that fomc persons mult be clothed
j with the character of judges, and the whole put
â â over into their bands.
n In October, 1786, the ordinance for this pur
-3 pose firft pafTed. He believed it would be found
t by the journal that it pasTed unanimously. He
y had ncyer himfelf been witness to any public mea
sure which fee rued to take off such a preiTure from
> the mind of every one, or which was received with
d fach enthusiasm. Ihe meaCure was so popular and
j fatisfaAory, that it was thought expedieut the next
year to extend the provisions, and give larger pow
t eis of chancery to the general board. The Anal
j ordinance on thisfubjeÂ£i was then pafTed. Hebe
, lieved it would be found in the journal about May
j 6th, 1787, and that- this was alio unanimous. As
, tke formation of the government, under thepreCent
t constitution, the fame diTpofition continued, and
1 the ail jult read by the gentleman from South-Ca
. rolina, (Mr. Smith} was pafTed. If he miftuok,
, nor, this was without opposition.
, TKefe things, said he, are not unknown in the
. several states; the men who were concerned in th'efe
. times and events, are not all dead. He believed,
when they should commua'icate with the different
(late legislatures, these men would not be back
ward to (how themselves, and to (how that they
were ft ill of the fime mind, and faithful to their
engagements. I hough some individuals in this
house appear to be quite frefh on the fubjeft,
as if they had made freftvdifcoveries, and seem dis
posed to-begin anew, and fay all they know about
the S. Carolina frigate, Penobfcot expedition, fea
coaft guards, military .bounties, rule of quotning,
&c. &c. which had been for months, and almost
for years, the fubjefts of general fcramblc, he had
no apprehension that there would be found in the
dates any difpnfition to revive those difgraceful
scenes. However, if the states choose to go over
the bulinefs again, the sooner it is known the bet
ter. 1 his can only be done by writing to them as
the present resolution proposes. If they mean to
abide by the present settlement, and yet state incon
veniences ia complying with it, they who had ferv.
Ed mod with him knew, he had not often been an
an advocate for intemperance in public mcafures
He (hould not forbear to mention, that there was
one part of the fubjed which gave to him the molt
unpleasant sensations, and that was, where a state
had, in a manner which he thought waj not to be
judi6ed, obtained an advance from our treasury, of
certificates to the amount of cue million two hua
dred thousand dollars, in theaffumption, before the
settlement of the accounts, upon a falfe pre'fump
tion that we were indebted to them, when at the '
time they were indebted to us a million of dollars. !
He (hould never believe, until he had seen the at
tempt made, that they cauld be reluitant in re- '
turning to our treasury, the million two hundred
thousand dollars in certificates, which had in fadt
been advanced to them by mill ate, or that they
could expect in futh circumstances the states
to submit to a dire-dt tax to raise money to pay ]
them a quaiterly interest on those certificates. ,
Mr. Livingftoa could not permit it to go out to
the world in the aecouat of thisday's debates, that
he, or any of his colleagues, had made ufc of fucti '
expreflions as charging the commiflionet.s with be- [
mg wicked or corrupt, or with being bribed. Such
expreflions had neither fallen feom him nor his col- '
leagues. the highest refpeft for one of .'
them who was fincedead, bot still he believed men -
with the bed intentions, might have admitted im
proper charges to an immense amount. Indeed, if f
it were deteimined that the states (hould be called
Upon for the balances, he (hould bring forward a
resolution to the effed, and (how the grounds upon
which his suspicions were founded.

1 the Rhine, as his pohtion at FryboUrg is very ad
vantageous, his ritar being cveied by that tiver,
and tioth his wings by thi- fortrefles of Strasbourg
and Huningen. Meanwhile the archduke Charles
is collediong all the dispersed deta hments, to pie
vent general Moreau's advancing, and it is therefore
very probable that a very decisive battle may hap
pen in the invitons of Brifgau. General Moreau
has affected his retreat so well by feigned marches,
and his frequent attacks on the imperialists, which
were alway* made in mass.
MILAN, October 10.
Extrait of a letter of general Buonaparte, to the
senate bf Bologna, who sent to him the late ma
nifcfto of the pope.
The manifetlo which you sent tome, is not sign
ed, and I doubt whether it is from the pope or
from an enemy of the religion. Woe to them who
attract the vengeance of the French nation ! Woe
to kUvenna, Facenta, and Rimini, which are lo
much led in-o error. These cities lay aside the
jsfpeft which they owe to a viftoiious army. The
reign'of fednftion will cease, and liberty alone will
icraai matter of part of Italy. The moment is at
hand wbep Italy will fhiiw with honour amongll
poweiful nations, Lombardy, Bologna, Msdena,
R e gg'"Â» Ferrara, and perhaps Rufaagna, will, on
a future day, be the admiration ofEurope. Hurry
to take arms ! That part or Italy which is yow free
is rich and populous. Make the en-mies of your
rights and liberty tremble. I shall not lose you
out of fight. .The republicans will {hew the road/
to vi&ory. Learn from" I hem to vanquish ; I (hall
lead your battalions
From the (New-York) Daily Adzertifer.
Extract of * letter from a refpeAhble Merchant in
New-Londnn to his correspondent in this I'try.
" By a vessel arrived here 11. a short passage from
Liverpool, we have London account! to the 15th Nov.
Accounts are different with refpeA to Lord Malmf
bury's embafly ; from his long tarrying at Paris, it is
fuppol'ed something pacific will talve place. The
French have been severely beaten by toe Archduke ;
Moreau was obliged to re cross the Rhine on the 26th
O&. In the London Gazette he is , ( faid to have been
greatly harraffed in his retreat, and that he loft much of
his baggage, cannon, &c. It is said that most of the
French generals are tired of liberty and equality, and
wifd to resign. The news from the army of Italy is,
that Wvirmfer made a sally from Mantua, on the 7th
j Oil. and routed Buonaparte, with great loss ; all his
' magazines were deflroyed, four or fivr thousand men
were killed, and 200 oxen were taken. Other accounts
fay, Wui infer made another sally about the 17th, (id
defitoyed all their works, and put a great nu'mber*to
the sword ; a few more such Itrokei will oblige the
French to abandon Italy."
Remarks en the Abvve Intelligence.
On the receipt of the above we have made a careful
comparison of different accounts in order to reconcilc,
if pdiTible, the apparent cÂ»ntradi<Sion of a part of them*
The firft advantage, flateil above to ha, e been obtain
ed over general Buonaparte, is said to have taken place
on the 7th OA. âThe last advices from this general
are on the Bth, in which he states the capture of a small
sortie from Mantua, and fays nothing of defeats. We
are also in pofTeffion of a letter from Alex. Berthier,
the commissioner, of a similar date and purport. The
above account therefore if true, mult be incorrect, as
to date. Under Vienna dates, however,, of 19th Oil.
given this day, an afiertiun is made of advantages ob
tained by general Wurmfer on the 6th which, in some
measure, coroboratcs the London account. As to the
I'ubfcqucnt a<Sion on the 17th, the Vienna arcounts, of
the above date, speak of Gen. D'Alvinzy being order
ed to aiil in favour of General Wurmfer on the 15th.
This makes the statement of an a&ion with General
Suonaparte having taken place on the 17th conlidera
bly probable. Th* aflion with General Moreau on
the Rhine, ob the 20th, is also rendered probable by
the Frankfort accounts of the 22d, which we also give
this day. From a comparison of these different ac
counts, which we have give* to aflift our readers, they
will be enabled to judge for theeafalves.

COMMUNICATION.
The talk which is at present impofei on the jfaco
binsby theirctusl fate isTeally to be pitied. They
are forced to take the unpopular fide, and that colls
them tome qu,ilms of fear, though none of conscience,
for while a thing is merely wrong they care not, if the
people will receive it for a time. It haÂ« been their art
to find out fubjcdH of irritation, and inflame the pas
sions of the citizens as much as pofiible. The oppo
sition to the excise. to the treaty, &c. &c. are exam
ples. Bit now the country is clearly and de-iidedly
with the government, and indignant against all the
nte ifures of foreign intermeddlcrs, yet notwithlland
ipg, our Jacobins are obliged to stick to their employ
er. Their taithfulnels and their spirit do them credit.
They are good swiss, the bell of mercenaries. If the
aflignats should fail, no doubt, they would drop off,
for they take the motto, point d'argent, point Ae/uiJ/e,
â¢u de dimtcratt. And in point of candour it would
be wrong to take their services, if they were not well'
paid t-or them. To degrade our owa country and go
vernment, and to swear as they do that true liberty and
happiness exist only in fight of the guillotine, to tell
thepeopla with tV.e Bollon Chronicle ihat their dispo
sition toward# France is rebellious, to do and fay all
theft and ten thousand other infamous things is worth
a good deal. O Jaeobins, great ftould be your re
ward, for great will be your, condemnation.

1 < TO THE PUBLIC.
r
s THE caution introduced into the public prints,
e warning all petfonr. against purchaling from Â«fie
grantees of Bliir M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and personal estates he conveyed away to
hit fon>in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation hid upon the fubjeft by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion ef that trull confidad in the fubferibers by
those creditors : a (lep which it would have been a
s breach of duty and honor in them to have omitte 1.
The very statement of the fadt therefore mull dif
e pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
0 or vindidtive." It originated in a desire to fccure
r the property of the debtor as a fund for the pjy
ment of his just debts. It was fandlioned by the
