if taken coming from one, (he should be

her destination "Was taken by a French priva- j t

Extraft of a letter from Pendleton county,
Wa(hingtÂ»n diftrift, July A, 1797*
" We have just finifhed a most pleasing
< day, made so by a combination of happy,
circtimftanccs* The recurrence of the an
niversary of our independence, although
our sensibility may have been awakened,
has been hitherto witnefied in silence ; but
the return of the present, the 21 ft, when
America arrived at age, made it too strik
ingly interfiling to be passed 6ver without
fixing upon it the marks ot our sincere joy
and exultation.
" General notice of the celebration hav
ing been given by the managers during the
fitting of our court, on the 27th ultimo,
and that general Anderfon had very politely
accepted a request of the volunteer compa
ny of light horse, to deliver an oration on
the occafioti, as large a concourse of the
inhabitants of the county assembled as was
ever before known.
" At day-break this auspicious morn
Was ulhered in by the firing of a field-piece.
" About ten, capt. Earle's volunteer
company of light horse paraded before 1 the
court-house. The uniform, with the en
s signs or colours, being quite new, and the
men well armed and mounted, their truly
martial appearance afforded great pleasure
to their fellow citizens. The corps after
wards retired to exercise, jn doing which
they (hewed great proficiency. After go
ing through a variety of manoeuvres, the
party divided, returned to the town, and,
having made a spirited charge in the pre
sence of all the fpedtators, dismounted.
" At twelve a signal gun was fired to
form a procession to the court-house. The
ladies were placed in the fropt, conduced
by major Farrar j general Anderfon, pre
ceded by the cornet with the colours, fol
lowed, saluted en pajfant by a field-piece,
and accompanied by Messrs. Thomas Hun
ter, Striplin, and Miller, the managers for
the day. Capt. Earle at the head of his
â¢company of horse, succeeded; and the
whole was filled up by the large body of
citizens
" The ladies and gentlemen having taken
their feats, general Anderfon delivered a
patriotic and well adapted oration, replete
with political information and judicious ad
vice to his fellow citizens.
" The oration being closed, the compa
ny returned, in the fame order, 4o a civ(c
arbour prepared for the purpofe,under which
a handsome dinner was served up, and of
which the ladies firft partook. The gentle
man succeeded, general Anderfon presiding.
'( During dinner, the following Poafts
were given by the President, each accompa
nied by the discharge of a cannon :
1. The United States of AmericaâMay
wisdom pre fide over her legislative councils ;

II MEMORY.
or The late Doftor Franklin, in thp more
,; s early part of his life, belonged to a deba
se tingfociety in Philadelphia! At one of
0 f their meetings, it was the doctor's turn to
propose two questions, which werÂ« as fob
en low, âWho of aH people in the world, have
a the best memories?âfecond :âWho of all
, te people in the world, have the worst raemo
(j. ries? This occasioned much learned dis
quisition amoupg the members. Ont irgu
ia. Ed that people of the best memories, are
those bleiTed with health and strength, strong
nerves, vigorous apprehensions, and in the
G f prime of life.âOthers pretended that as
| e . memory, like all other human faculties, is
improveable: those have the best memories
that had during a long course of education,
, a . been obliged to learn much by heart, and
thus became adepts in the art of remem
ay bering^âMultitudes of arguments were
s . brought according to every one's fancy; but
â j on the other qucftion it was universally a
greed that very old people mult h::ve the
_ worst memories of any, as in the declining
ra . ft age of human nature the nerves become
weak, and the organization of the brain so
far calloused as to retain but weekly the
lts impreflion of past events. There was no end
re _ to the learned theories broached on the oc
ef. cafion. At last Franklin got up, and with
3 ] e the gravest face in the world, informed the
h e ! that of all men livi\ig, Creditors
had the best memories, and Debtors the
;at worst. _ .

The Hull r'dvertifer of July 8, faysâ
' Monday, July 3', died; capt. John Eaton, a
' who had been appointed by lbrd Bridport
afting captain of the Marlborough, of 74
guns. He arrived in town on the preced-
ing day, and attended ou Monday at the
admiralty about ten p'clock, and sent up
' his name to earl Spencer. The meflenger
brought down wqrd that his lordship could
not be spoken with until twelve o'elock.
' Captain Eaton waited in the lieutenant's
room till near that hour, and several persons
pafled in and out without obl'erving anyr
' thing particular in his condu&. A capt.
e Oughton was the only person in the room,
and was looking out of the window, when
5 hearing some noise, he turned round, and , j
saw capt. Eaton bad dabbed hijnfelf in the
belly with a kind of dirk, and was making
further attempts to hinifelf. He !
immediately called for affidance, but be- j
fore any could reach him, capt. Eaton had
dabbed himfelf in the fide and in the neck, ,
but the firft wound was mortal, as part of j
the entrails had burd out. During the
agonies of death, several loose expressions
escaped the Suicide. He cried out, " Jus- J
tice, lord Spencer, justice !"âI have
done my duty!"â" D nto all 1
Traitors!" and then mentioned the names
of two officers. A medical gentleman was '
called in, but the unfortunate officer died 1
in about 20 minutes, and was laid out on
the floor of ' t room, with a (heet to cover
his body. a. was to remain there till the
morning, then to be removed* to the duke
of Clarence public house adjoining, where
the coroner's inquest is to fit. Capt. Ea
ton was about 30 years of age, had the
character ps an excellent officer, and orders
had been given for his being made pod as
yederday. It is difficult to account for
this paroxifm of rage ; but he is supposed

charadterifed them, seem on the point bf

logize for prejudice. The Smigrsnfs of all di
defcriptioiis are crowding back into the tc
country, and aristocracy no longer shelters fz
j itfelf under the made even of moderation, h
1 Societies are formed avowedly for tlip cor- ti
reftion of republican ideas, and a venal h
press is a&ively engaged in preparing the c
public mind for a gradual retiirn to the fu- f<
perdition of their ancestors. v
The arrogance of the French dire&ory d
lately received a mortifying check'; Gilbert t>
Defmoliers, at the close of a masterly fpeee'n k
oil the finances, said, addressing hinifelf to 0
the council of 500, " The directory pre- c
fumes to criticise your opinions, It has
been proposed that my report (hould be t
' sent to the directory. Ido not wondei' at t
this motion, sinCe one bf the diredlors de- c
manded, in my presence, that I (hould be Q
obliged to lay the speech I delivered on '
their table.â(Tbe council (hewed it the 1
mod marked difapprobation.)âlt is high 1
time that the directory (hould be taught not '
to alarm the public by indecent meflages, '
but to confine itfelf to its functions, to 1
wait your orders, aud not to. meddle with 1
your discussions." This speech was listened
'to by the council with the utmost attention, <
and received with drong indications of ge
' ner l applause.
The discussions in the couucil of five bun- 1
dred, on the fubjeft ot finance, h?ve been ;
long and violent. In the course of them,
| the dire&ory have been .treated with little
ceremony. Males, one of the members of
I the council; observed, that there was the
greatest danger in leaving five men maders
J of the public fortune ; and that their re
s fponfibility -would be of little advantage
r when all the public refourcCs (hould be ex
hausted. The projedt of Defmoliers â¢ wis
adopted ; the objetl of which was, to de
' prive the executive direftory of a difcrefi
, onary power in the application of the pub
lic funds.
~ A late meflage of the direflory to the
' council of JO'J, read in secret, contains a
I mod alarming pifture of the aftual date of
the finances. 7 It begins communicating to
the councils a memorial of the Bureau of
Â£â¢ Police, refpefting the hospitals, the pri
sons, and all the institutions of humanity.
s Bitter tears of agony (lied when
â¢ one reads the following details contained in
' this report.âOut of 1800 infants placed
U in the foundling hospital at Paris, since the
s month of lad December, 1500 have perifh
s ed in consequence of bad nourilhment, or
rather the want of nurses, who were oblig
n ed to quit the hospital as their wages were
not paid. The prisons fuffer the fame pe
e nury, and there is good reason to believe,
that for want of care, the prisoners may
escape. The public funftionaries expeiri
t the greatest delays in the payment of
their salaries, and several of them ha*e de
stroyed themselves. A long silence of con
[g fternation succeeded the reading of this
message. Gilbert Defmoliers br ke this
j silence by reproaching the directory with
the bad fydem of adminidration which it
continued to pnrfue, the pra&ice which it\
' had of swallowing up, by anticipation, the
n produft of the contributor?, on the privi
lÂ«ge which it regularly'gave to the contrac
" tors on objefts the mod sacred, such as the
j hospitals and the prisons. A warm discus
sion took place, which ended in the meflage
being referred to the committee of finances.

Capt. Mess of the Sandwich appeared as
prosecutor.
j Vice Admiral Buckner was the firft evi-
denee againd Parker. He was cross-exa
mined by the prisoner, as were mod of the
n witnefles ; and he appeared to do it with
more ability than could be expedled in his
" situation. The point of his heading the
1 C " mutiny, as might be supposed, was clearly
edabli(hed, as was also that of his being
U one'of the mod aftive in getting the (hips
â¢1 , to fire on the Repulse when aground, in
endeavouring to escape from the mutinous
)rC fleet. Thomas Burry, a seaman of the
Jr " Monmouth, deposed that Parker came on
board that fliip, and ordered one Vance to
assist in direfting the Monmouth againd the
Repulse. The prisoner said, " damn you
20 flip y our bower, and go along fide the Re
pulse, and fend her to hell, where (he be
up longs to r and (hew her no quarters in the
ins i lead." Parker cross-examined this witness.
ith He said, " you have been telling a great
lys deal about hell ; I wi(h to know if you
bf have been promised any thing for advanc
lu- ing this helli(h account." The witriefs re
ich plied in the negative. The evidence took
;is up two days. At the close, the president
the then informed the prisoner, that the evi
po- dedce for the prolecution clofcd, and
dc fired to know when he Tfrould.be prepared
to proceed in his defence. The prisoner '
said he must beg some time to prepare for
his defenceâit wc'tild be necelfary for him
to have extradls from the evidence. He
had no friends with him, and therefore he
could not be ready to go on with his de
fenccto-morrow. The cotirt told him they
were willing to allow him every proper in
dulgence ; but at the fame time it must be
recolle&ed that there were several officer*
kept from public service, and therefore all
linuecefiary delay must be avoided. The
court then gave him till Mondav.
Parker has written a very submissive letter
to Sir Thos. Pafley, expressing his fatisfac
tion at so refpedlable a charadler being
cbofen to preiide over his trial. The wife
of Parker has,prefented a paper to the ad
miralty, slating to the.board that her Ijuf
bafid is at times in a state of insanity, and
has inclosed fn her address to them a certi
ficate of his difebarge from the Royal Wll-.
iiam, in 1794, on account of symptoms of
mental derangement; which of course will
be laid before the court.
Monday, June 27.- Tht4 day Parker
entered upon his defence. He read it hirn
felf, and brought a number of evidences.
The whole was coodu&ed'better than might
be expected from" a person of his talents,
and in his fituatibn.
The prefideirc advised him, as there were
very heavy charges brought against him, to
consider whether there wa3 not any Other
person whose evidence might weigh in hiÂ»
favour.
The prisoner aflced whether, if any thing
occurred ifl the course of day, he could
derive any advantage from if.
The president told him, that was impossi
bleâis he let flip the present opportunity
he would not have another.
The prisoner exprefTed his confidence in*
the Court, that they would lean to the fide
of mercy, and the drift Jifftice would be
done him j he thought he had already made
it appear that it was owing to l.iS exertions
that the Sandwich had been delivered tjp to
the command of her officers, and that instead
of being a leader of the mutiny, he had
done every thing in his power to check and
keep it under.
The prisoner was ordered to withdraw,
and the court wa3 cleared for the purp<>fe of
leaving the members so deliberate upon the
sentence-
In two hours and a half the court was re
opened, and .the prisoner being called in,
the lentence of the eourt was read by the
Judge Advocate, which was.
That after deliberating upon the eviden
ces on both fides, the' Court was unanimous
ly of opinion, that the said Richard Parker
r is guilty ps all the charges brought again
him; that in consideration of those crimes,
. as unprecedented in their nature, as they
i were wicked in their tendency, and which
! were no less definitive of the interests of the
1 navy than they were injurious to the prof
t perity of the country, the court were unan
t\ imoufljf of opinion, that the said Richard
f Parked should fuffer.death, and be hanged
- until he be dead. They accordingly ad
- judged hiin to be hanged 011 board what
; ship, and at what time the Lords Corhmif
- fioners of the Admirality may be pleased to
â¢ appoint.
Parker, the prisoner, with a degree of
fortitude and undismayed composure, which
t excited the aftMnifliment and admiration-os
i everyone, spoke as follows:
â f "I bow to your sentence with all drÂ«
- fubmifiion, being convinced I have adled
e froin the di&atesofgood confeience.âGod,
- who knows the hearts of all men, will, I
c hope, receive me. T hope that my death
- alone will atone to the country; and that
n those brave men who have afted with me
will receive a general pardon ; I "am fatisfied
they will all return to their duty with ala
crity!" .
e President, It js in the breast of the court
5 to order you for execution immediately, but
e we think it better to give you time to repent
g your crime.

with her husband, on board the Sandwich,
â - previous to his execution ; with the extra

i- After delivering her petition 'in favour of"
1- her husband to Earl Morton, who promised
I to present it to the Queen, Mrs. Parker
1, waited at St, James's till five o'clock in the
; afternoon, on Thursday the 29th of June ;
when losing all hopes of a favourableanfwer,
she proceeded into the city, and got into a
is coach setting off for Rochester/. where she
arrived about 11 o'clock that evening. She
i- immediately agreed with a boatman who was
1- going to Sheernefs with garden fluff to take
le her on board at 4 the next mrrning, which
h was that fixed for her husband's execution,
is She embarked accordingly, as soon as the
le tide would serve, and got down along-side
y th? Sandwich about seven. Tie sentinels
g ordered the boat off, she desired permission
is to speak with Richard Parkerâthe anfwv
in was, that if the boat did not put off, they
is mull fire into it. In spite of her remoa<-
le ftrances, the boatman now proceeded to
m Sheernefs, alluring that as the Yellow
:o flag was not up, 110' execution wotild take
le place that day. She instantly a
iu nother boat from the dock flairs, and, as she
e- was rowed up to Blackftakes, she observed
e- the fatal flag hoifled 011 board the
le âher application was renewed" with tenfold
s. entreeties to get oa board, but to no effeft,
it .and again she was taken back to Sheernefs,
iu the waterman having stipulated only to put
c- her on board the Sandwich, and being obli
e- ged to go back for persons he was engaged
>k tercarry. She hired a third vessel with no
it more fucccfs ; for jufl; as she approached the
i- ship, ike saw the fatal procession of h<r
id hulband from the quarter djci. ts the faixÂ«caflle, wlicu (Lritking oiit " Oil my dear i
husband !" Phc fainted away. On recover- !
ing The saw him moiint the platform on the 1
cat-head, and tb<; clergyman in his robes go
frofti him, and from tliafc. moment (lie fays i
she- " fajV nothing but the Tea, which ap- '
peart,-d covered with blood !" - Thus sense- , i
less (he was rowed a third time on (liore.â i
She Embarked in the fourth boat, and saw j
- him from a distance 3t the yard arm, just be- j 1
fore he was lowered down ; by the time
(be reached the ship, the body had been re- (
ccived into a fh-11, and carried away for in
terment. ;
She requeued of admiral Lutwidge to i
have the body, but being refufcd, (he went
. the fame evening to the burying ground,
and feeing three women near the ground,
(he imparted to them who (he was, with her
dtfign of recovering the body of her hus
band, and requested their affiftaiice, to
which they readily a (Tented. She direftly
ascended the gate-way, and helped the wo
men, till all got over;' when with their
hands alone they removed the earth that
covered the coffin, which was laid but a lit
tle way in the ground : having raised it,
they contrived to get it over the gate, and
then fat upon the c ffin, to conceal it from
the cefitinels of the Barrier gate, hard by,
till four o'clock in the morning: the draw
bridge being now wound up, a fi(h cart
came out of the garrison on its way to Ro
chester, when (he prevailed upon the driver
to convey the body to that place for a gui
nea, which he undertook Arriving at
Roche'fter, (he agreed with the driver of a
caravan to take it to town for fix guineas
more, and deliver it at the Hoop and
Horse-(hoe, Queen-street, Little Tower-
Hill, where, itTeems, (he had hired a room
for the purpose, and brought the key in
her pocket. The body had not been here
long, before a mob was collected to fee it,
and Mrs. Parker was summoned before a
magistrate to give an account why (he re
moved him. She replied v to have him bu
ried like a Christian. The magistrate then
a (Iced whether it was true that (he had fuf
fercd him to be (hewn for money ? ShÂ« burst
into a flood of tears, and replied, " Do I
appear l\he a monjler so unnatural!" It wai
proved afterwards that there was not the
smallest foundation for so unnatur 1 a report.
The body was at length deposited jn the
4 vault of St. Mary, Whitechapel, the bu- j
rial service being performed by the Rev. Mr. j

Trial of the Mutineers of the Pompec.
Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, a
court'martial was assembled on board bis
Majesty's ship Royal William, at Spithoad,
.CQnfifting of The hon. Capt. Pakenham,
Prefidcnt.
Captains Oplfn,Montague,Faulkner, Pick
more, Peyton, Yorke, Leoge, Barker, Mid
'dletonWilkinfon Frafer and Herbertâ for
the trial of Guthrie,Calloway Afhley,John
fon ar.d Davies, for making, and endeavour
ing to make, mutinous a(Tetnblies,allon board
his Majesty's (hip La Pompee ; and James
Braham, for being present at such affem
blics, all of them belonging to the above
ship. Ten witnefles were examined yesterday
on the part of the prosecution,. wyich all
tended to criminate Calloway, Afhley, Gu
thrie and Johnson. Hitherto nothing has
appeared against: Braham, and nothing fur
ther against Davies, than that the other four
held their meetings in his birth, and that
it was the place they swore all such people
in as they could, through ignorance or other
wise, prevail on to take au oath to aflift their
views in petitioning for peace, which could
not be brought about, they said, without
the difmiflal of his Majesty's Ministers, and
which, they added, they were determined
to effedfc. Calloway, who seems to be the
mod hardened fellow among them, observed
to one ofthe.people to whom he tendered the
oath of being true to each other, to obtain
by all means peace and liberty, that he wan
an old man,and that his life could not be of
much confequence âhowever, he would free
ly facrificeit, fee his heart's blood flow and
drink it afterwards sooner than relinquifhthe
pbjeft of forcing the Ministers out of place,
and have, an immediate peace. All the evi
dences in this day's proceedings were re
fpeftable looking men, and gave their testi
mony iii so clear a manner, lhat there is lit
tle doubt of what mud be the fate of the
(mutineers. Guthrie is a fine looking man,
is the Captain's Cockswain, and also Quar
ter-Master of the (hip. When off U(hant, he
pointed to it and said " There live our
friends, not our enemies." A fluey is
young, and by trade a patten makerâwas
a levy quota man; aud seems to be fond of
talking. Calloway is about 50, an ill look
ing fellow; is also a quota man ;|and so is
Johnson. Davies and Braham seem to feel
more for their situation than any of the reft.
The court has adjourned till nine o'clock to
morrow.
Friday, June 23. This morning the
'court, according to adjoinmeSt met again
on board the Royal Wilb'am, when Afhley
was put on his defence, who aacufed Gu
thrie of being the most prominent feature
and aftiv'e person in this business. He en
deavoured to invalidate one or two eviden
ces against him, by proving that they had
frequent quarrels. ..-He madman appeal to the
feelings <jf the court, but did uot attempt to
disprove the fads e(labli(hed against him.
Johnson proved, that he always was a
man of a serious turn of mind, and prefered
so lit Vide to-tlic foticty of hum ; that he often
exprefled a wi(h to lead the life of a hermit,
and intended Â£0 offer himfelf to Lord Mount
Edgecuijibe, who he understood had a cell
for a leclufc, under particular and rigid re
ftriftions.
Davis produced so many and such respec
table witnefles in favour of him generally,
that every impreflion of l>is being a princi
pal, was done away.
Braham was fully convi&ed of having used
-turbulent language, but in other refpe&s he
proved his character and conduft to be gene
rally good.
The court then pafled sentence of dc-ath
Sgainft Guthrie,Calloway, Afhley and Johr.-
lon ; Braham is to be confined 12 months, j
and Davis was acquitted. Guthrie and :
Calloway were recommended to mercy.
SaturdayâOrders have been- sent down
from the Board of Admiralty, ordering the
execution of Afhleyand Johnson, aud repriev

Letters from Genojt, dated the 6th of June,
fay, that the revolution has broke out at Port

The whole of the in/litution appeared to he

The college of physicians have declared
our prevailing fever to be of a 'contagious
nature. What must we think then of those
physicians, who, when they are called to
visit sick people, tell their families and
neighbours' that, they have not gotten the
bad fever, but they have gotten only com
mon colds or fevers. By such aift-s of de
ception and cruelty, the disease was propa-'
gated in the year 1793*-- The treatment
of these colds and common fevers, as they -
are called, shews that the physicians do not
Relieve themselves, for it is exa&ly the fame
as fQr the yellow fever, vis;, by plentiful
bleeding 1 ani purging. I wish the' Board
of Health would forbifl t|ie above decep
tions in future, and thereby save many lives.

T expedl to leave this City with my fami
ly in a day, or two, if you (hould think pro
per to reply to my letter in answer to yoilrt.
both'publilhed in Mr. Fenno's paper, I {hall
on my return, which I hope .will be in a few
weeks, answer whatever you may oppose to
the fafts I have stated refpe&ing the origin
of the awful disease which prevails in this
city, At the time I wrote my letter to
you, my mind was mpch engaged on the
fubjeft of my removal from town; I there
fore overlooked what you relate from the
information of the captain, "that the crew
" of the Aretjhufa left the (hip immediately
" after her arrival in port, havingprevioufly
" carried with them their chests, wearing
" apparel and bedding, and that he, the
" captain, had previously depofitea what he
" called his light faile which are often used
" for bedding by mariners, in Mr. Bridges
" Sail Loft, these fails alone without any
" other infected article you fay, were fuf
" ficientto give origin to the awful disease."
From this recital .the following questions
naturally occur ; doth it appear that one
person tooktbe disease from-thefe fails in Mr.
Bridges Sail Loft ; or that any of the late
crew_ of the Arethufa or other ptrfon were
taken with tlie disorder at their refpeftive
lodgings ? no doubt the bedding and wear
ing apparel of these seamen were as much
iu fe&ed as the fails of the (hip, and it is
probable if any such cases had taken place,
you would have heard of themâafter the
scrutiny which it appears you have made in
tracing Jie supposed infeftion from this (hip.
I have this day heard of three men who have
died in the yellow fever, the origin of which
it is said, can "be traced to the Snow Navi
gation, with as much certainty as the na
ture of the cafe can require. The particu
lars may hereafter come before the public.
BENJAMIN WYNKOOP.
Mr.' BEJJpTMTN-WViTKOOPF 1
f~ SIR,
I THOUGH I have neither leisure nor
â¢retirement at command, yet, as you have
tailed upon me, in Mr. Fenno's paper of
the 26th instant, to afiign a more probable
source of the prevailing fever than the one
you have afligned, or confefs my error : I
will endeavour to oblige you as far as it can
be done Jwithin the limiti of a column in a
newspaper.
The source you have afligned, is opposed
by insuperable fafts ; by past experience ;
and, by the nature of the dPfeafe. You
have asserted that the offenfive smell was firft
observed in the neighborhood of Messrs.
Latimer's. <ind Sims's Wharfs, after the
Swedish snow Navigation had discharged
part of her cargo, which must the
date of her arrival) have been on the "28th
of July. The Swedish captain acknow
ledges that a stench was observed at the
time voa mehtion, but positively denies that
any stench proceeded from his vefTel, the
crew of which were not only healthy at that 1
time, but have continued so ever since, one
man only excepted, who was sent to the
fort with the scurvy. He alfa alledges that
several hands from on (hore were employed'
in discharging the carge, none of whom
1 were affefted by it. The.captain also states
that the stench complained of, arose from
the bodies of five or fix dead dogs which lay
putrefying in the vicinity of the dock. Mr.
, Latimer also "ays the stench was not like
I that of bilge waterâand notwithstanding
the information you received from Mr. Afh
mead, he has since allured Dr. Caldwell, that
he believes the stench alluded to, arose from
the bodies of dead dogi and, cats which lay
in the dock, because he observed it always
to be most offenfive during low water.* But,
fir, if your statement was granted, it would
| avail you little, because, by comparing the
' cases of the persons firft infedftd, with the
time that you suppose the bilge water ex
haled its' pestilential venom, you will find
| that they could not have originated from
that source," even if bilge water was capable
of generating 4 disease of a malignant and
j contagious nature, which I believe was never
! before fufpefted by either physician, phi
| lofopher, or historian, and of which I am
; sure there is no inflance on record, or even
handed down by popular tradition.
Mr. Latimer's man was sick at the time
the vefTel began to unloadâMr. Latimer
j himfelf, and twq of the crew of the brig
| Iris from Oporto, which lay more than 200
! feet below the snow, tfere attacked with the
fever, which in one of the crew proved un
equivocally to be the (fellow fever of tropical
origin. Three more of the fame crew were
attacked within three daysâMr. Lewis, on
the 1 ft of AugustâMrs. Smith, Penn-ftreet,
a ijonfiderable distance below each of the
velfels, died on the second of August-âher
son took the disease from her and diedâ
Mrs. Fergufon, near Mr. RufTel's wharf,
died on the sth or 6thâher son, a student
in medicine, on his return from. Burlington,
during his mother's illness, caught the dis
ease from her, and soon after, his father,
- brother and two servant girlsâMr. RufTel's
servant girl and a young lady took
â¢ easeâ-and a young woman at Mr. Plankin
horn's, who had the black vomiting, a
* Tbtrt vim lately a gretft mortality among the cat* in
oiticr fmrts'qJ tip siix, but nit xcHw jcycr follrwsd.
symptom which diftingul/hes the yellow
fever pr the Weil-Indies, previous to
termination, from all other diseases.
I cafqs I believe received the con
tagion from certain articles brought on shore
fronn the Ajethuf* ; my reasons ,for -this
opinion have been feted in my addrefa to
we citizens and in my former latter ret you,
âbut I do not believe it was conveyed to
them, as you suppose, by the east or.any
other wind, but by contaft ; because fun
dsritand enough of the laws of febrile contaÂ«
giipn to know that it is never conveyed thro*
the medium of the air 20 feet, perhaps not
iq, when detached from the substance to
which it adheres, and alio that no variety of
fever which originates from the exhalations
of putrid vegetables has ever been conta
gious.

York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which
trails Of Und large funis of money have been paid
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers â¢
It is therefore just that public information (hould
be given, to the end, that the injured may feck re-. 1
dress while the men have property, and are to be
found. Those who have been discovered are Tr
uman Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
ft vera! other! who go under fi&itious names. It is
supposed that the lands offered fcr faleon those fa
i bricated titles ate at teall worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have a<9ual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and 12, Otfego patent,
thousand acres eich,thea<9nal property of William
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and James Averill
and others, of this State. There is some grounds '
to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and ;
diaries Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.â7lie Printers will do well to give
this a place in tjkeir papers, as well to caution the
public against surchafiiig those lands, as also to de
prive those rru*n in future from imposing on indivi
duafs, whicb their education and address have en
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a fhopkeeptr of some note in this country.
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point
of view wickÂ«dnefs of those men, which when
the public have perused, will induce them to ex
enfe the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July iÃth, 1797.
I Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Wit, omb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
j deed to them, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, which
: was the-property of William I. Franklin now Mr.
f Chamont's and others; snd further the said Joseph
, and Truman did persuade me to do this against my
; inclination, which was made ottt on the icth day
j of November, 1793, or set back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the nam&.of
I Pardon Starks to that deed was a fiflitiou# name,
there being no such perlon there. To this I make
voluntary oath. THOMAS KELLY.
19th July, 1797.
On the 19th July, 1797, came personally before

On the 18th July, 1797, came before me Jacob
Kibby, a person by me well known and worthy of
good credit, who on his solemn oath did fay, that
I' two of the parties abovementioned did make ap
plication to him this deponent, some tjme in the
winter of 1796, to make thera a deed for two thou
sand acres of land in the Otego patent, and pro
mised this deponent a fharc of the profits, on the
fait of said lands, for his so doing ; and th it they
male application several times for the fame purpo e,

claring to them that he had no right to lands, and
