liberty ; their captain or master' gives a receipt lp {>â 
the chancellor of the Conlulate, which the lafter u
forwards to the miriifter to whom he is subordinate,
and this receipt passes in the refpedtive exchanges 11
which aie made with the enemy to procure the en- b

Ucs 7, 8, and 9, cf this fame resolution of the 3d "
Brumaire suppose the exersife of a jurifdidtion a
whicii belongs undoubtedly to the justices of peace e
throughout the Republic, since the legifla/ive au- t
thority has attributed it tb them ; but whether the a
discharge, the proclamation, advertisement, the sale t
by a public audtionetr and the other adts of territo- Â«
rial power, can unequivocally be exercised by the t
'chancellors in foreign ports? Is a question which J
your committee did not answer until they had ex- f
amined the sth article of the refoluties which at- i
tributes te the councils the judgment of the validi- *
ty of prizes after_the arrangement of the proctfs
by the chancellor of the Conlulate.âHere, col- t

From its duties towards Welfare deduced its inde- f
pendence, the unity of power and that of jurifdiq- t
tion 5 thefime principles prohibit the introduSion of any 1
foreign tubÃc authority whatever, into the bosom of |
the Empire. From its relations with other nations \
emanate different duties, amonÃft which there are t
but two which relate to the fubjeft we are treat- t
icg upon ; these are the firfl reciproeity of ufagr, (
and next the obligation Â»f contributing- as far as it' t
is in our.power to the happiness of other nations t
to their ,piÂ®fperity and to the preferyatiou of the t
peace tliey enjoy ; this right of nations has recei- I
ved, by treaties and Conventions, different mndifi- |
Cations, sometimes even reftiiftions, and a positive I
right has been introduced, which might be com pa- â

imperial city of the Teutonic Hanfe, a French tri
bunal to decide in the caÂ«fcÃ and trials of the nati- i

every principle, aÂ«d the article has never been put

Agreeably to the treaty between France and

seamen of their nation ; but this difpufition dpes n
not extend beyond the clews [ the " Sin article o

Tll vain has your comn.ilfion fought for the cHe- ti
blifhment of aj ur ifdiÂ£t ion of French Consuls in so ll
reign count ryes, offucha natuieas that which the ii
refoiution supposes ; it no where exifls; and the o
purer the principles are upon which a natidn has q
founded its conlfitution, & the nearer they approach o
real liberty, the more it is inclined la repulfeevery p
proportion offuth a iftvifioti of one of lie mojl.ejfeullal at- tl
tributes of itsfovereignty. o
It U true that different capitulations and frea, p
ties with the deys and defpotg of the States of Bar- b
bary,and the ports of the Levant, suppose that'tri f'
als between Frenchmen may be determined by Con- h
fuls ; but those abfolu'.e princes who, without ex- d
pence or controul are fupteme Judges over the a
livetand fortunes of their fubjefts and llaves, eafiiy is
figure to themselves, that the judicial authority of f
their country, mult follow them wÃcrevef they go,
in'o whatever country they tianlport their domicile, t
and trtm reciprocity, they discover themselves when- ji
ever the cause of a foreigner is in quellion ; but lit- 0
tie jealous of the exclulive excrcife of this noble "
attribute of lovereign power,'often fatigued with f
the plenitude of their authority, they without re- n
gret fuffer a few particles of it to escape them, and n
this dereliction'is to them rathei a relief than a
privation : You will not, however, amongst them 1
fee b Consul inveited with the right of pronouncing c
in matters of prize between his countrymen and f
netiti-Jls. Your comÂ«.i(Taries have also analized the f
Treaties and Conventions of foreign powers relating t
to commerce and navigation ; they have examined c
more than thirty documents of this nature, but they,
have no where difcovered'Confuls in foreign count
tries, established judges of piizes ( all these treaties 1
suppose that Confn's have r.o jurifdiition tven over t
the individuals of tHeir nations, unless it be volunta- 1
ry on the pirtof the latter and reduced to the sim- t
pie forms of arbitration ; the power is even refer- j
ved almost generally to the two parties or either of 1
them,.to bring his adversary before the tribunals of 1
the territory ; but iu> one ever dreamt of rendering \
Consuls Judges bet-ween their, countrymen and nw- Â£
' trals.âThus it would be in vain for us to wish to t
confer upon our Consuls this prerogative which is I
truly extraordinary ; it would also be neueflary' to
. secure thrna the exereife of it by a treaty ; but sup \
posing any foreign power ftcie difp<?led thus to '
: ft rip itfelf of a portioti of its j jiJfdidtion, you can
. not, my colleagues, dt>ubt that they would at the I
1 fame time demand a reciprocal exereife in our i
. ports. r
A fingla example will render what I have ob- <â 
served much mote ftrikirg : Let us suppose peace t
; re-citabiifhed between France and Gieat-Britain, c
â  and this power at war with Spain ;an Englilh pii- t
â  vateer forced by ftref3 of weathei to put intooouri r t

â¢ are ii.teiefted in the prize I
taken from the Spaniards ;in fadt the captured al- ;
leges to have been taken in the waters of our domi- 1
nion, within cannon shot of our shoresâin all these I
cases the territorial jiuifdiÂ£tion is claimed, and that 1
of the enemy's Consul coutefted. Indifferent to <
, thedifpute, should we fee the British Consul fore- 1
- reignly pronouncing upon, discharge and restore i
: the prize, and even prepare with a fecrel j->y,. tfiÂ«

hundred to two thouland league from us, and thiÂ»
difpulition is evidently impracticable of exeqmiou.
It was necelfary for your comftiiiTlon to enter in. i
| to these long details, in order that if the Council of
I ansjents adopts a rel'oltuien which is not plear as ;
j could be vviihed, no doubt may arise as the real sense i
iu which it receives it. >
The conduit of the commillion has been dictated i
by the unalterable vilh of maintaining our treaties I
unviolable, ofreJpeHing, and caii/ing to be i
by ail our agents and officers the rules of the rights of j
nations, of asking nothing of other nations except
undei the law of a just and perfe>Â£t reciprocity ; in *
a word, to wvvent (he affirm!.ition in matters of
prize, of the chancellors to the justices of the peace
and of the consuls to the tribunals of cotnmerfce, '
except foJi?* as this disposition may be found to
compos l both with engagements already entered in
to, aik! onr own.domeitic jurffprudence.
But it will belaid that the view which the com
ttiilJionh.fr, presented to the Council, of the Hate of
our commercial Â»e!ations and the fun&ions of our ]
Cyntuis, proves the necefil'.y of prefcribitig to the :
greater part of theft agents a rule of conduct in the j 1
important and ddicste fuljeS of prize.' Here col- |
leagues, the constitution presents us a fufficient point I
of (iippart in the attributions.âThe experience and 1
ability of a minilter of foreign affairs : Hejs educa
ted in the study of hiflory ancj treaties, hÂ£ has con i
ilantly on his deflc, and much more perfetftly in his
incmory all the conventions and adts which regulate
our affairs with foreign nations.âHe is even ac
quainted with the different intereils and engagements i
of those nations amongfl therefelves.â He antici
pates demands and complaints and in early to ftifie 1
the germs of dtfeontent and the causes of rupture,
or to prepare happy reconciliations, for oftentimes
peace or war is in foma degree in his hands. It is
by his attentive cares that he (jecures our repose, the
ftipport of exteiior tianquility is the produtt of his
labor. Perhaps at this raomcut instructions wifelv 1
drafted trace the progiefs of Consuls, and this filegt â¢
and fetret work is so much more meritoriotisj'as he
is often ignorant of the perfoiu who may reap the
fruit of it.
The commiiTariet of the executive power near
the tribunals,ate also provided, by the miniftert of
ju!tice> with extia&s of all conventions and treaties
of commerce and neutrality with foreign powers;
it is their duty to remind the judges of the difpo
fitionsol these conventions and treaties, and to de
mand the execution of them as often as exigencies
| may require it. 'Flu y prevent the tribunals of com
i tnerce ftom pronouncing (lightly upon confifcations
i upon a pretence that indemnities may be granted in
r cases where a wrong 'Jetifion may take place. Ia
j fine, they maintain 91 lincerity in judgment asd more
? particularly in eveiy thing which.may interrupt
r the neutrality of pow.ia not engaged in the war,
j or commit us in oppjlilion to them.
(I We mall not examine whether the principles of
. thst neutrality proclaimed with so much fplondor
s by Ruma, and received with so mneh acclamation
r by all Commercial nations (except England) have
. not experienced formidable attatksln the course of
. the present war. It is fuflacient for us that they arc
. jull, for us to persist in supporting them, wc will
f bring back to them all nations, whom error, per
f haps reciprocal, though traufient, have carried a
y way from them ; they will on their part be convin
ced that it is their duty, as well as their interest, to
3 take efficacious raeafurts to caule their neutrality to
s be I'cfpected. ' ,
3 In fa6t our miniders by inftruaiont wifely drawn 1
will secure the execution of the law, the plin of
3 which isjubmitted to the Council of Ancients.
We fiave faitl fufficient, Olleagues, to prove, 1
e that it it is adapted to present ciiCtimftances, still 1
r it requires dcvelopcmerils, and is only the summary
of a code which is yet incomplete ; it will regulate
â  everything whiih may relate to trials by appeal;
e the manner of proceeding in them without prejn
i, dice to equity on one part, or a celeiity which is in
- ok the other,and prevent tricks and chi
/ canery in the tribunals of different degrees; it is
a time perhaps when all profeflions are freed from
- their ancient ftinckles, to prevent the exciulibn by
c foimaiitirs wkich' still hold to the infamy of navi .
- gation.tliofe who demand to launch into the career
- of glory, of danger and of fortune. Tiie legif
e latot will combine at the fame time with the utility
tot giving a greater liberty to cruising-, the Rcceffity

Copy of a letter from Citizen Buonaparte, Gene
ral in c.hies of the ai my ot Italy, to the Exe
cutive JOiietiory. fX
Citizen Diiectort,"
I was of opinion that the crossing of the. river
Po, would have bee" the bcldetl a&ionof the cam
paign, as like wife the battle of Meliefimo, one of
the most vigorous actions ever known ; but i have
i now to relate the battle of Lody.
| The 2 tft, at o'clock in the morning, the
lurad quarters reached Cafal; at t ire our vangmrd
encountered the enemy defending the approach of
Lody. 1 immediately ordered all the uavalry to
mouut, and four pieces of cannon, which had jult
arrived, to be placed. # â¢
General Angereau's division who had (lopt at
Borgetho and hat of General Maffina who had
slept' at CaC.il, marched immediately ; meantime
the van-gua.d ovtrfet all the different posts of the
enemy, and took from them one piece -o,f cannon.
We entered Lody in purluit of the enemy, who
had already crofted Adda, over the bridge, lieau
lieu with all his army was rangec. in order of bat
tie; 33 pieces of cannon de.cp 'ed the paffitge of
the bridge. I can fed all my cirti.ierv'to be placed
lin one battery. The canonade for several hours
. was very vigorous. As f;>on as-the army arrived,
they were ranged undei a close column, having at
their head the battalion of the Carabineers,
and'followed by all the battalions of grenadiers,
beating the charge and exclaiming, Five la Repubâ¢
lique.
We soon reached the bridge, which is onÂ£ hun
dred fathoms in length the enemy made on ns 3
tremendous discharge, the head of our column
feemedfor a moment to hehtate, one fit nation wjs
really critical. Generals jÃeHhier, Maffina, Cer
vano, d'AllemarjÃf, the chi-.fs.of the brigade Lnf
ne, and the cii.ef of the battalion, Dopet, all [>er.
ceived it, and throwing themselves at tlie head of
the army, decided the fate of the engagement.
Our formadable column oveifet all thai opposed
it, all the enemy's artillery was carried a-wSy Irem
them ; Beau Feu's order of battle was broke, and
in Us flight spread every where terror and death,
in an inflant their whole army" was scattered.
General Mufra, Angereau and Berrant, crofted
?.s fiion as their division arrived and completed the
viftoiy. The cavalry eroded the Adda by a ford
which being very bad, delayed their march and by
that means prevented their charging the entmv.
The horse of the enemy charged our troops, but
did not fiud it an easy matter to terrify them. Night
coming on and the extreme.fatigue of the troops,
patt of whom.had already marched more than ten
leagues on the farjis'dny, we \Vere not all. â wed to
puifue them any farther. The enemy loft 20 pie
ces of cannon, two or three rhoufand men either
kil|ed, wounded or taken prifontrs. Citizen La
tour, ai.l-de-camp of Genetal Maffina, leceived
fcyeral wousdt with a broad sword. I demand that
this brave officer be made chief of a battalion.
Citizen Msrmuate, my aid.-de-< amp, cliief of a bat
talion, had his wounded under him. Citi
zen Mafrois my aid de-camp capt. had his coat
fifted with balls; the courage of this young officer
is eqrtal to bis activity.'.
If 1 to give the names,of all the, militair'ei
who diftiuguifhecf themselves on that glorious d..y,
1 should name all rhe carabineers, and grenadiers of
the vanguard, and almolt all the officer* Â®f the E
tat Major. But I ran!! not forget to mention the
Berthicr, who was on that day a cannoneer*
a horseman and a grenadier at the fame time. Sug
ny, chief of brigade, who commanded the aitiU
lery, behaved gallantly.
Beaulicu flies with the remainder of his army;
he is 11 w cfolling over the Hates of Venice ; seve
ral towns of which have Ihut their gates. Sir.ce
the beginning of the campaign, though we had
very warm actions, and the arfiy of the RepuHhr,
were oftentimes forced to shew a great deal of hold
ntfs, ntnVe of tlu-m has yet been so terrible as the
croflisg of the bridge of Lody. If we 101 l but
few men, it is owing to the hade of the execution,
aiv.l the'hidden effeit which the mass a"d tremen
dous site of that intrepid column prodmed on the
army of the enemy. .1 defnand that Citizen Mou
ni.-r he confirmed adjutant general, who serves '<1
that capacity, although he is not includ'd in ihis
affair. 1 demand that Citize'n Rey, aid de-tamp
of the brave Maffina, and Citizen Thoiret, woit.iy
adjutant of the third battalion of the grenadiÂ«3j
be both made captains.
As loon as we (hall be fettled in a plnce, I will

at nu great diltance from Lody, a fmill battalion of
Nadafli, and two squadrons cis horse, defending tlie
pafiuge, with four p-eces of cannon An ailion took nt
place ; the enemy aftpr having hajl fever.il men killed,
and loft one piece of cannon, were forced to evacuate bi
the town of Lp,iv aÂ»ju to fall back on the main body of til
their army, -ivhich ltood on the left b.nkof the Adda.
We hid hardly entered Lody, when Bejulicu's army w
began a heavy cannorfade upon ,ihe town. Their de
sign was to hinder the crossing of the bridge which he
had not had time to cut off, and which was â¢iefended
by 10,000 men, both infantry and horse. General, C
Buonaparte himfelf ran immediately thither, and un- ar
der,a hail of cafe (hot, caused two pieces of cannon to ar
be placed at the entrance of the bridge to liinder the p
enemy attempting to cu it off, an 1 while the
cannonade was going on vigorously an both lUles, be
ordered Angereau, general of a division, to join him m
as soon as pollibte ; he also gave orders, to general Mas- rc
fena, to range under onctoU mn the four th-mfani ca- 21
rabineers and grena iers, and kept every thing ready if
for the crossing of the bridge. cc
That column of republican heroes beipg formed, tf
he went through the different ranks His presence in- a[
ipired the soldiers With rnthufiafm. He was received
with repeated acclamations of "Vive la Republic".
He ordered the tharge to be oeat, and immediately the "
soldiers with the fwiftnefs of lightening rushed on the w
bridge. The heavy fhowerof cannon and mufker-iliot jb\
which the enemy poured on ps, ftopt for t moment the 1 tt
column, and had like to have (haken it ; but t [
Berthier, chief of the etat-major, threw himfelf at Â£
their head, and being gallantly seconded by Mafieni,
general of a division, and by the genetnls of the bri
gades, Cervoni and d'Allemagne, made them force,
the passage. The grenadiers threw themselves on the fe
enemy's pieces and in an instant carried them away.
Tire ailion continued, and the victory was yet uncer- - c ,
tain, when general Angereau, with a forced march, 0 |
arrived with his division, whole vanguard was com
manded by getierol Rufea, and completed thÂ« defeat of
the enÂ»my. They were driven 01ft of all their po!}s, 31
leaving behind them all their train of artillery, wag
gons and baggage, and the field covered with dead, M
The mult qf the molt glorious viojoi-y of the cam- L
paign, on aceonnt of the obstacles we had to funrfount,
is 1000 men made prisoners, isoo killed or wounded, t;]
100 horses killed, 400 taken, iSor ao pieces of r.an-
no-i aiivl howitzer taken . had it not b.'en for the
nifjht, we should have pieked up the fcatterea remnants
of Beaulicu's army.
There has been on that glorious day as many brave â 
anions performed as there are republicans in the army.
Everyone did his dutv. But I mutt not fail to dwell
on the merit and courage of Marmuate, chief of a
battalion, and Marois, aid de camp to-ths general in
chief. The firft, w/ho on all occasions has difplaycd
as much aflivity as bravery, parried off, at,the head of
a detachment of horse, the firfl piece of cannon from q
the enemy. The other carrying th:general in chief's
orders, palled several times through the cafe fliots of
the enemy, in cool blood with an affi%iirEble intre
pidity. He had his coat all over fifted with balls. S

cruel enemy, vvho in the midst of his own difaflers and

truce n hich he himfelf demapded and which you ge
nerously granted him, in tie hopes of an approaching |

which your invincible brethren have infMed on him

Th - following CharaAcr of this work
is cxtrafted from the Wonthly Review, p. 3 JI Â» 3 la Â» ' iIT
March, 179 J. "i
- "We have no small degree of pleafnre i r n announcing
the present worli. to our readers ; as one wh rh from the
freedom of its enquiry, the grandeur of its views, and the
fortitude of its principles, is eminently deserving of atten
''' tioji. By this eulogium, we would by no means he under
:t ' flood to fubferibe to all the principles which these volumes J
aÂ£ contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived at degree of
T eertainty which ts requisite, for any two men to think a
like on alMfubjeas; neither haslangnage attained that con
, fiftcnt accuracy, which can enable them to convey their U|i ,
* thoughts, even when they do thinkalike, in a mannerper- ,
' fedtly correal and intelligibly to both. These difficulties
are onljr to he overcome by a patient, iflceffimt, and bene
volent invetligatien.
" Many of the opinions which this work contains, are
- bold; some of them are novel; and fomedoubtlefsare er
roneous :âbut that which ought to endear it even to those
[ whose principles it may offend, is the llrength of argu
' ment adduced in it to prove, that peace and order mod ef
fectually promote the happiness after which political re
formers are panting ; âthat as the progreÂ£s of knowledge
is graduaJ, political reform ought nÂ»t to be prficipi&tc;â
and that convulsive violence is dangerous not only to indi
viduals (for that rcfult would Ke of small
account) but to the general cause of truth. It is the op
pofiteof this principle that inspires the enemies of politic
al enquiry with so much terror ; it js the fuppofltion that
change i*,aft inevitably be attended by the turbulence and
iajuftice of commotion; and that innovation cannot be
nude without th< interven - ion <sf eyils more deftru&ive
than those wh'ch are intended to be reformed. Ulider the
cor.vicftion of this philanthropic fentmicnt, of calm and
gradual reform, (which in its proper place he lias fully il
lustrated) Mr. Godwin proceeds without scruple firll to en
quire info .present evil, tSi-il br.xncUes, and .
next to demonstrate future good. .
" Dividing his work into eight books, making rn
JMrORCA.ttCJE.Or fCILJI'ICAL INSTITUTIONS the fubjt-S of
the firll, he begins by an attfmpt to prpye the omnipo- .
tence of government over the moral of mr.rikmd ; J
and that on these moral habits their wisdom, virtue and ~
felicity depend." |
