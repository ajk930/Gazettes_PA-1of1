A member of the French Convention has
had the beldntfs to assertâthat seven rights
of the prizes taken by the cruisers of the
Terrible Republic, *JÂ»ave been Neutrals
and that France Wotild severely fufferby such
absurd policy.â We difl not think there
was as much reason and ho ( nefty in that in

have received much higher honors ? The mo.

There is as much hafenefs in flattering a !
multitude, as an individual. What j
are we to think of the Aurora, which is e- '
ternally add effing the people in contradif- |
tindion from the government, thus: The
majestyâthe sovereign yâ the omnipotence
of the people. 'I he m: b fvcophancy is as
despicable as any court flattery.
Four months ago the anxiety on the fub
jeft of French insults was universal. Al
though we did not tremble at the profpeft j
of an open r pture with that haughty re- j
public, yet it gave us uneafmefs. We fear- |
ed her daring boldnefs,"uncheckÂ«d by any !
moral reftraipts, and we were ignorant of
her rwn strength and resources. Now
though we regret that negociation has fail
ed, and all hope of accommodation is van
ishedâwe feel our situation so vastly differ
ent â that her demand of tribute and her
menoces Â«f fuhjugation, we hear without *
ore vibraiiou of fearâor rather with ineffa
ble contempt.
The disadvantage of the loss of reputa
tion for integrity, was nevsr more visible '
than on a late occalion. The Aurora, as is
very common with that vehicle of impudent
falfhoods, published a i'cter which not with
fia"ding the ftrongelt afieverationâcould
gain belief wi h no one but those who wilh
ed to be deceived.

" A (fate of things may exist between two
nations in which Reprisal not only becomes
the right but the duty of the nation fultain
â¢ ing the wrong. This happens when one na
-8 tion without caufe'forcibly seizes upon the
1- j effefts of another, or of its citizens, and with
â¢ holds them without reflitution or compenfa
a tion ; and when the nation whose effefts (hall
a be so seized and detained, (hall possess no
- other means of indemnification. The right
1 of reprisal in the injured nation, in such a
e ; cafe, grows out of the injury sustained, and
tl its jnabiUti? 40- ""fjHfc itfelf in any other

e ; tioo, and in cafe of the losses of its citizens,
3 upon the promise sf the proteftion of the
j property, sacredly made by the nation to its
j individual members."
a ! "A regard for peace has been conArued

- has invited new aggreltion ; appeals for juf

1 are upon the eve of war, because they have
not exerted their rights at an earlier period.
If this Condnft has been heretofore wife and

k â¢ justice, moderation or honor of a government,
. j which has prr.ved itfelf equally a ftraftger to

s quiescence besfets injuries, injuries beget in

Ml. fENNO,
THE remarkable contrail between the
Aurora and the other city papers in refpeft
advertisements. is well worthy of notice.
âlt explains in 'he most forcible language
the cause of the political heresies and falf
hoods, with which the former constantly
. teems.
; ' In that- vekicle of sedition, on the 23d
5 inft. twenty one insolvent debtors gave no
t tice to their creditors, that they had applied
for the benefit of th< aft, provided for such
[ persons. In the fame paper there were on
. ly three tcffels advertised jâwhereas the o
ther city papers are Crouded with advertife
merts of merchandize for sale, anu vessels
. for freight; but they contain very few, if
, ar:y, notifications of the former kind.
this display of the embarraflid si u
ation of the Aurora's patrons, (and I pre
| fume they arc almost all similarly situated)
1 it is but reasonable to suppose that revoluti
ons would better suit their circumstances
than regular government.

[Br E. A. W. ZIMMERMAN ]
The author of this work having htard it
argued in a numerous meeting, that the re
volution of France was ocÂ«aficned by the
fame cause, ai d had the fame tendency with
that of America, was so ftroniÂ»ly affc&ed
with a conviftion of the fallhood and dan
gerous confcquences of such an opinion} that
he engaged to oppose it in print. The ex
tent of researches necelTary for the accom
phfkment of his engagement required the
labour of several years 5 and the book be
fore tts constitutes the firft volume of his un
dertaking.
Zimmerman endeavours to (hew the
dissimilitude of the two revolutions in their
cawfrs and consequences, and derives his
proofs from two sources ; thedefcription of
the countries, and that of their iahabhants.
In a former work, which has been t â  ice
printed in German, and of which a firft vo
lumn appeared at CafTel in 1784, in French,
intitled â¢â¢ Zoologie Geographique," the
author had rendered himfelf familiar with
inquiries into the nature of countries; and
he has availed l.imfelf of the authorities, to ,
cftablilh his fafts in the present publication ,
according to tlit fame method. With re .
gard to that pirt of his work which relates
to men confirlereci as the inhabitants of a }>e
culiar diftriA, bis reasoning is eftablilhed
on the pofttion that this animal, Ike every 1
other, is fubjtA so the influence ps climate '
and different physical ciufes, as well as t
ihofe moral energies of which the influence '
has never keen doubted , and that the l.us
man charafler, with all its effedls, is deriv. '
v d from these sources.
A simple history ms the two nations, t
would not have accomplished the aim of the f
writer ; but it was indispensably necessary
that he should apply to the bell b-ftorical 1
documents, in ord. r to develope the diftindt
ive ligns of national charafler ; at the fame i
time that the geographical ftrufture, and
tbe aftual political situation of the coun- 1
tries, wcreobjt&s of attention in the deduc
tion of his relnlta. Concerning those geÂ«t- f
ral refuhs, it wiil be for us to
v . , â¢,
