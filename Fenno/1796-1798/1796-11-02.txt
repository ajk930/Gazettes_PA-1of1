PHOCIONâNo. XIV.
IT will not now be denied, by any person ac
quainted with the state of pDblic affair* at the a
larming crisis io the summer of 1793, of which we
, have been fpeakmg, that Mr. Jcfterfon wr.B averse
to the President's ifTuing his proclamation of neu
trality, and that he.advised the calling together of
congress, deeming the proclamation a step too im
portant tn reft on t-he Prefident'i bare authority.â
. Whether this advice proceeded from "a secret with to
involve us in tvar, or from a conÃitutional timidity,
is immaterial to the present queltion : certiin it ife
1 that such a ttcj) would have been fatal to the peace
and tranquility of America : certain it is, that Ge
net, and all the Jacobins of the country, and all
the democratic focietiej, were exttesnely anxious
sos such a step: and while they rested all their hopes
of war on the meeting of congress, there was no man,
' who valued the welfare of this country, who did
not then shudder at the idea of such a calamity.â
For had congress been convened in Philadelphia in
the summer of 1793, bringing together all the pas
sions which had been artfully excited ia various
partsof the Union, finding a mass of pafiions ready
prepared in the metropolis, operated #n by all the
wiles and intrigues of Genet, and the mancsuvres
of the democratic foeiety, congress would, malt un
t doubtedly, have been driven to some intemperate
aft, of which war would have been the immediate
1 consequence.
' If it was so difficult to restrain a parly in congress
( from carrying hojlile measures in the winter follow
ing*, when ihe passions had confidetably abated,
when the pnblic mind had manifefted a marked wifii
for neutrality, and when Genet's influence was al
most fruftrated, how imjjoffible would it have b:lÂ£
to have refilled them, in the midst of thelc agita- 1
tions, which convislfed the whole nation, in
summer of '93, in the midlt of those political trm
pelts and whirlwinds which were then directed by
Genet ? The few rational and moderate lovers of
peace, instead of being listened to with that atten
tion which their opinions afterwards excited, would
have been silenced by the overwhelming acclama
tions of a faftttioas entkujiafm, and swept away from '
- their ground by the itrefi/)ij>lc torrent of exafpera- '
f ted passions. '
We-ll might Genet wish for the calling of cod-j ]
igrefs,* when he found that he could not mould the-: 1
executive to his views : well might he rave and
threaten, when he found the advice of the secretary
of state, on which he had depended, over-ruled in 1
the council, by the difcrction of the two other fe- :
eretaries, and by the wifclom and firmnefs of the !
Piefident! '
ihe letters which Mr. Jefferfon afterwards wroft t
to Genet and to Mr. Morris, and which have been ]
quoted by his friends as evidences of his opposition
to Genet's intrigues, prove only, that Mr. JefFerfon '
pofTe'Fed political sagacity enough to forefee, that '
had he, after the public fentimcnt was fixed, per- Â®
lifted in encouraging Genet, he would, like his less 1
cunning fucccffor, have been difgracefuliy JifiT.rffed 5
from office, and, like htm, rutned in the public ef- !
timation : for, like the friends of the iiifun eftion .
when they saw the government strongest, he there- j
fore made an ostentatious display of " his leal tÂ» '
maintain our independence and fclf-goveru|tient."
It is evident, that Genet considered this conduct as
a defedion'from his eaufe ; for in his letter, referred
to iu the note, be complains bitterly of Mr. Jeffer
fon's treachery and abandonment. He tifcs, in
that letter, these remarkable expressions : 'â¢ Bcfides
fir, whatever may be the refnlt of the *tckimment
of which you have rendered yourfclf the generous
inflrument, after having mass me BtLtEvt that
row wbre mt ritEND, after having initiated m: \
into mysteries which have inflamed my ha '
TRED against all those who aspire to an absolute '
POWER, there is an aft of jtiftice," Sic. page jo. '
Here Genet complams of, jefferfon's treache- !
roufly becoming the inltrument of his recall, after
having per Wed him that he was his friend, and '
initiated him into myferies of state, which had in- '
fkienced Genet's hatred against the President, ant! J
the reft of the adminillration ; in fact, after having
caballed w,th this foreign agent, ?nd by calumnies
against the executive, inflamed him to hatred arid
excited him to resistance. Again, page 73, Ge
Â«et lays to him, in the language of rep.'jach, " If
L have fhevsn fnmnefs (in opposing the President)
it is, became it was not in my chara3cr to fpeai as
many people de, 111 one -way, and att in another, to
an language, and a language con-
HDKNTtAL." 0
Nothing further is necessary to prove, beyond a
doubt, the improper encouragement which the se
cretary of ft..te bad given to Genet to refill the
Ptefident 3 authority ; were any further proof re
<jmr,te we might refer to the writings ot Uelvi-.

powerful ftippurt which that agent found, even In

' e materials, on which to predicate it, when the Prefi

came too i.npofingto admit of further hesitation,
n " then the fecrctary, to whom the talent of epistolary
- composition is not denied, produced an ab.e ietUr,
to in which he endeavored to make atonement by ele-
T> gance ;ind energy of (tile for his pit'vious mifcon
dudt apd oppclition.
:c 1 shall conclude this number with the following
f " remarks; id. Thecircumitance of Mr. jefFerfon's
being an enlhujiaflit admirer of the French cause
** (as Hampden delcribes him to be) is far from re
es commending him," in the judgment of all real A
"> mericans, to the prtrfidency. The President of the
d United States ought to bc~jm enthufiaflic admirer of
- no cause, but that of his own country; enthusiasm,
in in a politician, is closely allied to error and pa//ion,
f* both of which are the bane Â«t good government :
ls but enthusiasm for a foreign country leads dire Sly
y to subservience and- devotion to foreign interejls :
ie a chief magistrate, tntba/iajiicelly attached toFrance,
:t will therefore soon become a devoted tool ef France
>â¢ 2dly. 1 cannot discern the merit of Mr. Jeffer
e sow, of having, as Hampden exprefTes it, forborne
:e to faenjice the independence and ftlfgovernment of
hi& own country even to the glorious cause of
fs France; what attachment mult that man have to
r- his own conntry who could, for a moment, consider
1, thu, as meritorious ? Were the fact as Hated
!i (which I deny, and the contrary of which I have
I- proved) I (hould never be induced to view, as rqe
Â£ ritorious, the mere forbearance to be a traitor to
i one's country, by Sacrificing its independence and
fclf-gove i ament to the views of-Â»

j MR. t^KNNO,
THERE is lomething so very extraordinary in
Q thc fubflance of the communication of Citizen A
det, in the mode by which it is notified to the pub
lic, and the particular junflure of doing it, that it
mult exoite no less alarm, than enquiry into the cau
e; fes which have led to it.
The principle laid down by Citizen Adet as the
bsfisof the late decree, is neither wai/nnted by the
I ulage of nations nor the laws of neut/ility, k would
' annul all treaties, as soon as either of the contrac
e ' ting paities found it convenient, for he eftablilhes it
as a principle, " that a nation at war is not bound
t " to observe 3 treaty, whenever that treaty tends to
;1 " her detriment, by being advangeout to her ene-
" my " What use is there in a tieaty if either of
the contrasting parties may break it, as soon as
t they find it injurious ? Was not the article of the
treaty, to which the decree alludes, made with a
view to a w,ir between France and some other na
j tiojuJis United States remaining neutral ? Did got
i'rance know when (he agreed to that article, that,
1 h 'he law of nations, French property would be li
able to feizute in American bottoms i Was not the 1
law of nations so dated to be by Vattel, a writer
, of high authority in France ? Did not France then
_ make the (tipulation with iu>, in contemplation of that 1
j inconvenience, of which (he now complains, with the
expectation of being compensated for it bf the ad- '
n vantage she would derive from the operation of
othei parts of the treaty ? What pretence then can '
â¢ file have now tor complaint, when the United
s States have pursued the law of nations, the '
law cf neutrality and the treaty ? None whatever. 1
France may, for a time, avail herfelf of superior
force to moit'ft us, but her condudt towards us malt 1
be condemned by every impartial tribunal.âThe 1
mode of announcing the communication is no less '
remarkable than the eommunicatien itfelf : an of- 1

his camp near Wuirzburgh on the 51b, pu!he< on
a strong advanced guard, under* the corji'aiii o
lieut, gen. Kray, to fecurethe De Bone wo tie
Spefrart. That officr, arriri.ig in the neigto"^-
hood of Afchaffeobourg in 'the afternoon oMne
9th, found the enemy, to the number of twÂ« 1 Â°
faad men, polled so as to difpuie the pa Â» ,
sorest. After a severe cannonade, which laÃra 3
considerable time, he attacked them wilh much Ipi- |
tit, diovc them froin ilicir advantageous â 
and hi* cavalry, dill purluing them wit iout I
: tiou through the town, dispersed them m the W0014... I. ihe other fide of the Mcjn. The loss of the !
I -lemy oa this occasion amounts to above a thou
,:d men, of whom fix hundred are prisoners.
The archduke advanced on the 7th to Afchaf
fe wheie the main body halted on the Bth
âbut intelligente being received that the enemy
F hi'! abandoned Frankfort the preceding night, the
* advanced guards were pushed on-fuccelfively to the
Ki tzigand the Nidda.
On the 9th, his royal highness marched to Det
tingen, and on the 10th to Windecken ; the ad
vanced corps occupying the important point -of
Friedfcerg.
Â£ " Ten thoilfand men, drawn from the garrison of
Mayenc*, have advanced towards Konigftein (which
vÂ»as abandoned by the enemy on the Bth) and will
|Â£ be .1 very effentiai reinforcement of infantry la the
I army.
Tlie coiifrquences of these rapid and decisive
[ movements have exceeded the of the
' molt ting nine, and have unifoimly fruftrated the
tlefigns and efforts of the enemy.
Jourdan, jwlio after the action of the 3d, had
\ dirtied his retreat on to Fulda, was Hill in hopes
of gaining before the archduke, the strong pofi-
I lion of Bergen, where, reinforced by the two di
t vt(i*irs which had been left behind in the neighbor-
I hood of Frankfort, he might have checked for a
ttirr.e the progress of the Auftrians. In this view
he arrived by forced matches at Sehlaititern, on
ft. the great road from Fulda to Hanau, in the even
irg of the 6th ; but finding that the duke was al
ii ready matter of Afchaffenbourg. he gave up his
P- attempt ; and, turning to the rijjkt, directed his
Jf march across the VogelTberg, towards Wetzlaer,
\Vhere, it is reported, he is endeavouring to assem
ble his army.
From information of the mod authentie qature,
relative to the ptefent firuation of the French troops,
i I can venture to assure your lordship, that they are
Bjn a state of the uttnoft eonfuflon and despondency.
A great part of the iftf<Tr,tr/"liave thrown away
' their arms, and are almost naked. Their retreat
has, all semblance of order, and has become a
tumultuous flight.. Excefiive fatigue has probably
destroyed more of them than the sword ; and the
continual dread they apprehend of a general rising
K- of the peasantry in the countries they traverse, has
spread a panic among them, which renders thqm
deaf to the commands of their officers. The loss
i which Jourdan has fultained since he advanced from
may be estimated, without exaggeration,
jff at twenty tboufand men ; a number which must be
F daily increased by desertion, in the piefent (late of
his army.
\ The conduÂ£t of the French, during their abode
C jn this country, has exhibite.l a scene of depravity,
which is degrading to human nature. Robbery
and peculation have been universal in every rank
P Â»nd in every department of the army.

p that feparatethe Venetian dates from the Tyrolcfe.
" The division of general Vaubois departed at
the fame time from Storo. By the left fide of the
lake of Garda, his advanced guard arrived at Tor
gola, where he was joined by the brigade of gene
ral Curetife, who had himfelf embarked at Salo, on
the lake of Garda ; his advanced guard, comman
ded by the gen. of brigade St. Hillaire, met the
I enemy at Sarca, routed them and took fifty priso
ners.
" On the 17th, at night, general Pigeon, com
manding the light-infantry of general MafTena's di
vision, informed me, that the enemy in force had !
< retained the village of Seravale, that he had recei
ved orders to attack it; that he had forced the ene- 1

" On the 18 (Sept. 4), it day-break, we found
on'rfclves in the presence of the enemy ; one of
their divisions occupied the impregnable defiles of I
Motco ; another beyond Adige, prote&ed the in- f
; trenched camp of Mori. General Pigeon, with a 1
part of the light-infantry, attacked the enemy with f
his riflemetf ; brigadier general Victor, with the '
18th demi-brigade of infantry, pierced b,y, the great <i
' road ; this inflant gen. Vaubois attacked the camp c
of Mori ; after a vigorouscontell of two hours, the fl
enemy every where fell back. t
Citizen Marois, my aid-de-camp, carried an c

the mean time, entered at full charge, theynain- .tl
ftieet ; the enemy again fell back, leaving a great
number of dead and prisoners. During this time
- gen. Vaubois forced the entrenched camp of MoVi,
and puriued the enemy on the other bank of the
Adige. It was one in the afternoon, the enemy
profited of the difficulties of the country to front
us in 41 the defiles, and effected their retreat to
Trent. We had then only taken three pieces of
eannon, and looÂ© ptifeGers.
r " General Maflena caused all the half-brigade 1 !
1- to rally, # and give a moment's repose to his division,
during which we went, with two fquadroosof ca-
F- valry, to reconnoitre the Hiovements of the enemy
h in their retreat. They rallied before Callieno to
y cover Trent, and give time to their head-quarters
e to evacuate the place. Though beaten all the day,
C their position before Callieno was inattackable. The .
Adige almost touched the steep mountains, and for- j
:- med a pass of 40 toifes broad, closed by a village,
I- and elevated castle, and a good wall, which joined
if the Adige to the mountain, wheie they had placed
all their artillery. New difpolitions were neceTary.
if General Dammartin began a cannonade with eight
h pieces of light artillery. He had chosen a position
II which commanded the narrow parts of the aaoun
e tain. Gen. Pigeon pasTed with the light-infantry
upon the right: 300 riflemen threw themfclves up
e on the (hore of Adijje to commence the fufil
e lade ; and three demi-brigades, in a cl?fe column,
e and in batalions, pasTed the defile; the enemy har
raffed by the lively fire of out artillery, and the
3 boldness of our soldiers, did not refill the mÂ»fs of
s our columns, but abandoned the entrance of the
- pass. Tertor spread through all their line. Our
- cavalry pursued. Citizen Marvis, with 50 hufiirs,
â¢ gained their head, and (topped the whole column
a of the enemy. He crofTed it, and was himfelf fur
/ rounded, thrown upon the ground and wounded ; a
11 part of the enemy's force marched over his body ;
- he is severely hurt, but none ef his wounds are mor
tal. The chief of the ift regiment of hulTars is
s killed. Citizen Flifliere, captain of my company
s of Goides, saw two pieces of cannon, on the point
, of escaping ; he flew upon them with five or fix
- guides ; and, notwithstanding the efforts of the ene
my, (lopped the pieces.

r tSTiiVy omft have been contrtierabhf.
t "On the 20th, at Bin the morning, general Maf
i fena entered Trent. Wurmfer had quitted it in
1 the evening, to take refuge by Baffano. General
: Vaubois, with his division, soon marched in pursuit
r of the enemy, whose rear-guard was entrenched
3 L#vis, behind the river Lavifio, and guarded the
i bridge which it was necessary for us to pass.
j " General Dellcmagne, not without much diffi
-1 eulty, pasTed, under the fire of the enemy, at the
, head of the 25th demi-brigade. General Murat
; passed at the- head of a detachment of the ioth J
f chasseurs, carrying an equal number of infantry. L
General Leclerc, with three chasseurs, and citi
: zen Defaix, chief of the brigade of Allobrogi, n
, accompanied by twelve carabiniers, had been *
r able to turn the enemy, and place themfclves in 1
: about half a league in advance. The
enemy's cavalry, as they were saving themselves at
1 gsllop, found themfclves flopped. Eeclerc was
. (lightly wounded. The enemy endeavoured to open
, a passage, but the 12 carabineers crossed their bay
onets, and formed an inattackable rampart. The
1 night was already dark ; 100 of the enemy's huf

Fellow-Cititrnt,
At a period when the peculiar situation of our
country calls fÂ»r no common (hare of wifdotJt, pa
triotism aod finnuefs in the- chief magillraie of the
United Stales, are we summoned to the choice of
ieleflors.of a PrrGdent and Vice Ptefident, and on
the ptwdence of tbat choice, will in a great tnei
fure depend our future p ace and happinefg. Whilll
the desolating sword of War isdeftvoying the fail
ed countries in EuropeâAmetica is kept in peace.
The wife and prudent system of policy, adopted by
our present adniinillration, dispelled the ck>nds
which for a while darkened our political horizon,
and ft cured to our country prosperity aÂ«d happiness.
We are now to determine, whether, approving
of the meaiures adopted by George Wmfh'ington, and
fenCbleof the tleffings they have conferred on our
coÂ»ntrv, we will choofc eleflors who have uniform
ly evinced an approbation of hiscondudt, and may
therefore be expedted to give thyr fufTrages in fa
vor of men who will probably continue the fame
fyltera of wilt and patriotic policy.âlf such be
our determination, the perfbns now recommended
will naturally become the objects of our choice.
To the prudence of those republican eitiiens, sin
cerely attached to our national government, we may
fafely eutruft the power of making appointments
so important and interesting. Â«
With na'defire of dictating to our fcllow-cili-
zens, and with no interest but what is common to
all, do we address you. The hapjiinefs of our coun
try is in-- 'jived in the choice that (hall be made, and
we thererjre solicit your warmest exertions in sup
port of eta rafters whose fuffrages will ensure the
, peace and prosperity of the United States.
