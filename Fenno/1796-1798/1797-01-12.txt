cur very country to France ?So far from it, Vergen r<
nes did all lie could to prevent Mr. Oswald from agree- I
ing tÂ« have our country ceded to us at the Peace.âOn 0

Another lying claim to gratitude is, that we owe Â»ur 'â 
Independence to France. The fa ft is, the CÂ«mpt de v
Vergennes tried all the arts of a wily Courtier, to em- a
barrafs the acknowledgement of our Independence; n
The plain reason was this, France preferred clipping â

ISLE & F F R A'N C E.
The following intelligence frem the Isle of 1
France, was received by Capt. Fel , who "arrived 1
here, on Sunday last, in the Ketch Four brothers '
of Salem. It will icadily be ntcolledted, that the '
commiflioners of the exesutive directory, which were j
sent to j;ive operation in the Indian islands the to
laws of the French republic; and particulatly that
for emancipating the nejroes, were not permitted
to fuilain their funftiot s, but were ordered bv the
colonial afTembly to quit the islands, and have since
returned to France. These measures have been
considered by some at tafti ; but they are highly
jullified by the Americans then in the Isle of France
âas will appaat by the following;
ADDRESS
Presented to the goverament-of th? Isle of France,
by the Americans,, then in Port North Weft.
The Americans come to felicitate yau, upon the
happy event, which restores tranquillity to the
minds of all, and the reins of government into the
hands of those, under whom this island flonrifhes,
an enviable centraft, to the desolations and horrors,
that pervade the European colonies in the Ameri
can islands. It is for the cause of humanity that
we rejoice at the fruftration of a system, which in
volved tis all in one general ruin. We feel for you
t as brothers, united to you, not only by the ties of
interest, but by affedtion, cultivated by the friend
ly intercourse that has happily exifted'between us ;
it was with grief that we augured the interruption
of this mutual harmony, from the unprovoked in
sult given to the American nation, by one of the
commiflaries, which could have arisen, but from a
corrupt heart meditating on the worst intentions.
e âThe event produced by your firmnefs and spirit,
idifpels Â©ur fears, and we now look forward with
confidence to that uninterrupted friendlhip which
f we so earntftly desire. Americans to whom every
thing is interesting which interests the French, be
/ hold with admiration, these islands, and the analogy
of their interior situation to their local position ;
j two mountains that boldly rife in the midst of an
imcienfe mountain, on which the inhabitant tinin
,f terrupted, cultivates his land, whilst the thunder
rolls unheeded over his head and the waves fpead
their rage at his feet; and whilst he pursues a sy
stem of cultivation, thought neceflary in tropical
'> climates, it is no less pleasing to remark, that it is
a praise due to him, thai the hand of lenity light
j ens the toils of servitude.

e HOUSE OF REPRESENT ATI VE?Â»
y Monday, January 2.
Mr. Swanwick presented the petition of John
Marie de Boide, forrecompence for his ftrvices du
-- ring the wi.r.
OHjetlions were Blade to the admitting of this
ft petit ion, on the giound of its being inilecwroyfly j
f warded, and, from its having been determined u
*s pon in a former fefiion. The indecorum complain
-1 ed of was-the use of the name of the chairman of
r- the late committee of claims, mftead of the com
j. mittee, when speaking of the fate of his former
y petition. In answer to the other objr&iop it was
1- remarked that the present petition proposed to
bring forward an account current which had not
!s before been produced. Mr. spoke hijjh
f. ly of the merits of this petitioner, who, he said,
is from a pure patriotism and a love of liberty, had
m fought in the American cause (luring the late war,
e- for which service he never intended to have made
1 a charge ; but having afterwards gone !s the Weft
n- Indies, and being one of the fufferers at St. Db
a mii;go, by which he was reduced to dillrtfs and
if he had made a claim Upon the United
ie States iÂ«r his services. Mr. S. believed he was
now kept by t farmer fomewherc in the conhtry,
in eon&deratian of his past fei vices ; and, as to any
y. infoimality ef his petition, he believed it arose fiom
in ignoraÂ«'t-e of the forms required, (being a French
jr man) and hot from any intention to offend the le
as giflature of a country, which he termed in the con
cltifion of his petition, the freeft and iiappielt in the
world.
On a motion for reference, it was rejeftcd, there
being only 20 in favor of it. / ,
b- Mr. Swanwick said he had another petition to
j- prefrnt, which was of rather an unplealant nature,
:ir as it complained of the conduct of a public officer.
h, It was from William Pechin, measurer of coal and
r. fait, complaining that he had only received 164!.
r- 19s. 7d. from Mr. Dclany, the collector, instead
tie of 3471. 14s. Bd..and praying Congress t6 take
u- such steps in his favor as (hould givfe him the bal
c- ance. It was referied to the committee of corn
er merce and manufaflutes.
n- Mr. Swanwick also presented the petition of
n- Philip Stimel, Â«f this city, Snuff aaanufadurer,
(irayl fr for a renrfllon of duties on foufFlcftby the
dcitruftion of his mill on Ridly creek, by a frelh
in Augliit 179J- Referied 10 the Secretary of the
Treaftiry.
Mr. Livingfton presented two petitions ; the one
from John Hughes, of New-York, Au&ioneer,
praying for a remission of duties on 73 tierces of
Salmon dei'.r yed by the late fire ; and, the other
from William Uftick, merchant, of the fame place
fur the remission of duties on 73 hoglheads and 91
csfrs of claret destroyed by the fame unhappy event.
They were referred to the committee of commerce
and manufa&ures.
' On motion of Mr. Venable it was resolved that
all business referred to the committee of elt'.fMong
in the last feffun, and not determined upon, should
be referred to the present commiltee.âAgreed.
Mr. D. Foller, from (he committee of claims,
made reports on the petitions of Francis Menges,
William Story, Sarah Thompson, and Michael
Levadore, which were all of rhem unfavourable to
the petitioners. The reports were twice read and
concurred in by the House.
Mr. Swanwick moved that the report of the
committee of commerce and manufactures 011 the
fubjed of kidnapping negroes and mulattoe?, should
be recommitted to that committee, with iullruc
tions to report by bill or otherwise.
On motion, the quettion was divided, "but both
parts of it were carried by a confidera'ole ma
jority.
Mr. Murray said he had laid a resolution upoa
the tabic, on the fubjedt somewhat coririe&ed with
the one just difpofedof, which he wished to call
up. It was for the appointment of a committee
to enquire into the 1 propriety of amending the aft
refpedting fugitives from juiiice, and perions efcap.
ing from the fcrvice of their msfttri. The relo
lution was agreed to, and a committee of three
members were Appointed.
Mr. Parker called up the resolution which some
d.yVagÂ© laid upon the table, relative to a eallupon
the Wefident for information with refpedt to the
treaty with the dey and regency Â«f Alliens. Mr.
Parker fair! he found in the Prefiient's address, at
the opening of the feffiori, this paragraph, " After
many delays arid difappointitieiita, arising out of
the European war, the final arrangements fÂ«r the
'â¢] fulfilling of-the engagements made to the dey ijni
' , iegencv of Alglsrs, will, in all present appearance,
' be crowned with success ; but undei grent, tlrOiTÂ«h
1 inevitable difadvanuges in the pecuniaVy tranl'ac
tions, occasioned by that war, which will render a ,
further provision necessary." Under tlicfe circtim- *
| stances, it was not only proper to know what far
! ther legislative measures were necessary ; but also to
| learn what (teps had been taken for carrying-into
j effect the treaty with the dey and regency of Al.
I giers. It was last year, he said, ratified by the
Prelident and Senate, and that House had palled
the necessary appropriations, and he wns furry that
any delay had taken place in carrying it into cfi'eft,
as he understood, some of the priioners had died
between the period of ratification and that of the
releafement of the citizens held in (lavery. Some
} difficulties had arif*n, it fremwi, w'th which they
were not acquainted, aud therefoie he had brought
forward the prefeVit resolution, doubting that
the Prelident would readily gi* the information
required.
Mr. Sitgreaves suggested whether it would ntit
be proper to wait until they received from the Prelt
dent the communications which they had reason to
â  expect from his fpeerh. It was certain they should
teceive information fiom t'nfc proper department it)
due time. The President had said that farther ap.
propriations would be necessary, and of cuurfe, in
e formation would be given them on the fubjedt-
When this information (hould be communicated, if
it should not be so complete as to fatisfy the curio
r fity of the mover of this resolution, he might lay a
resolution upon the table calling so 1 father particu
lars. But, in the mean time, he thought it moll
proper to rcccive the communication which they
every day expe&ed. He had no objection to the
resolution in itfelf-j he only thought it would be
more refpedlful to the Prefidciit to wait a few days
lor the information desired, than to a fit fori!.
n Mr. Parker wished notto failinrefpeiS tot'r.echief mi*
._ giffrate ; but as large sums of.money had been appro
priated to onrry the treaty into yet, for fume
cause or other with which they were not acquainted the
18 business had not been completed, it became important
y to have some information on the fubjeft. There wai
I- great anxiety, he in the minds of merchants tra
ding to the Mediterranean, to lenow the state of this*
jP affair. He thought, therefore, they ought to obtain it
as soon as poflitle. It was from refptiS to the Presi
dent that he had not called up the resolution before that
â  r time. It the enquiry was longer delayed he thought
as the house would be wanting in duty to their eonffitu
o ents. Alter the resolution w-aspafTed, hefhoald not be
>t for prelling the fubje<si more than other gentlemen.
3- Mr. Craik said he did not kuow that there was fiich
1 1 a resolution on the table till then; but even from the
id mover sown confefiion, he did not fee any use in the
mtafure, as he had laid he did not mean to press the
matter after the resolution should have pafTed. The
I 1 efuient had told them at the openiag of the lefiion
chat more money would be winted, owing to some
J- einbarrafiments having taken place ; it was therefore
id to be expeditd that he would give them every neciTa
:d ry information on the l'ubjedl ; but if they entered in
a9 to the present resolution, it would be tacitly charging
y, '"J 5 ""fluent with neglect. The fubjeA Mr. Craik
iv .was n #t particularly pressing, and, as they had
J much other bulinefs on hand, and as he doubted not
' they would hate the information in due time, he should
b- be oppoled to the lefolution.
e- Mr. Gallatin wished a clause in the law passed
lalf leflion to be read : be believed it was expressed
le in genera) terms, fit was read and proved to be
e President in his speech, when he alludes
re to this fubjedl, said Mi. G. only fays that "final
arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made
to to the and Regency of Algiers, See." and
e, concludes with " mealures are in operation for ef
r" J reaties with the Regencies of Turns and
id 1 ripoli." And it was perfectly clear, that if raea
(.l. lures had not succeeded with the latter powers,
id there was a lufficient turn appr6priated to carry in
7to tfic,a tllc trtat y - w 'th Algiers ; because there
was ot onl y appropriated the monisy for carrying
B- that treaty into effefl, but also an additional ft.m
of 200,0c0 dollars for both ebjefts. He did not
of know, th.refer e , whether they should receive any
r, infermation Â«n tijis fubje&, except it was callcj for.Mr. G. said they had already received an estimate
of the expen es Lr the year 1797, and although,
tbcfe were fevcral items relative to foreign inter
course, there was not a* single thing about an ap
propriation for the Alg eri bulinefs. He thought
therefore, tho' fnms might be wanted for effe&ing
treaties with Tunis and Tripoli, the appiopriation
would be wanted next year, and not this, ana there
fore there would be money enough now for Algiers.
The only question was, whether it was their duty
to ask for the information contained in the refolu
tiion ; he believed it was, especially when they
were told thee had been great pecuniary losses,
they certainly had a right te> know what they were.
The propofuion, he said, did not ask for informa
tion how the treaty had been completed, but how
the money had been disposed of. This was infor
mation they had aright to have, in order to form a
judgment whether these losses might have been a
voided or not ; and, an he belived they should not
have the information except it was asked Tor, he
should vote for the refolutian.
Mr. Gilbeit did not doubt but they should get
the information wanted in a few days, without en-j
tering into a resolution on the fubjeft. They had
been promised information on other fubjedts, and
they'nn'âht be confident it was all in far.vardnefs,
and would be commnrucated as soon as pofii le.
Mr. Livingfton said gentlemen feemcd to take it
for granted that the President meant to communi
cate to them information on the fubje&of ihc trea
ty withithe Dey and Regency of Algiers. He
did not find this in the Prcfident's address ; he
found only a kind of exeufe that the treaty had not
been carried into effeit. He did not fay he would
communicate what was the immediate occalion of
the delay. It was the duty of the house, he said,
in a twofold point of view to call for this informa
tion ; firft, that they might provide the necessary
fund, and secondly ta know what had been the
cause of the great delay. The appropriation for
carrying the treaty into effedt had been long since
made, and unless circumstances unavoidable, and
urgency very cogent, had taken place, he would
not help thinking there mud have been a fault in
some department or other. It was not to be pte.
fumed the delay was with the President ; but he
believed it might be presumed there was a delin
quency somewhere. It was not enough for them
to be told that the delay arose from unavoidable
circumlhuceo j it was their duty to look the
business, and therefore he thought the present call a
very proper one.
Mr. Swc.iwirk said the gentleman from New-
York (M~ Gilbett) seemed to think they might
wai> a few days lor the information wanted- Mr.
S. said they had already waited for it a month, and
Bothi ; was yet brought forward. The feflion,
he faiii, waslitjitted, and it was important that the
bufi ess to which the resolution before them rela
ted, should be speedily taken into consideration.
It was very important as it refpefted commerce,
which was never in a more critical situation than at
present. It was high titpe, he said, to go into an
enquiry on this fnhjeiS, in order to know the train
in which the lÂ»ifinefs was placed, and to what the
delays had been Siting. He believed they had been
owing to the derangetnents of money tranfa&ioiis
in Europe ; but of this they ought to be it,formed,
aAd if thete was any charge to be made againtt the
house on the occasion, it was for having delayed the
enquiry so long.
Mr. Gilbert, said, the gentleman last up seemed
to speak as if the house had nothing to do, and
were waiting for business from the President. He
said there were various objects of great importantce
to the United States which called for their attenti
on ; and as he had before said, a short time would
probably bring the information without application;
and as they did not know that it was unneceffanly
retarded, there was no use in palling the present
resolution.
Mr. Sitgreavas said, gentlemen who supported
this motion,fpoke as if the right of the House had
beendifputed to make the enquiry. He had not
heard this doubted. The only reason foroppofing
it was, that it was lyineceffary, and less refpeAful
than it would be to wait for the communication.
The President had said that a farther appropriation
.was necessary this feflion, and he thought this was
a fufficient answer to his colleague (Mr. Gallatin)
and not next feflion, and therefore, he presumed,
he would take care, at a convenient season, that the
neciffary information was laid betore them. He
would"not call upon them to make appropriations
without {hewing beth the neeeflity and the quan
tum required. He had already said there could be
no question about their light of calling for the in
formation in question ; but he would not be un
derload to presume with the gentleman from New-
York (Mr. Livingfton) that was a delin
quency famewhere ; if this were preinmed, it would
be directly in oppefition to afferiion of the
President, who bad told them the circumftaHces or
delay, &c. had been inevitable. Upon whatptin
ciple, tberefore, gentlemen should conceive there
had teen a delinquency somewhere, he could not
fee. He-was therefore pppofed to the resolution.
The' qtfellion was taken and carried 44 to 3'"
A committee ot two members was appointed to
cany the revolution into cfied.

COMMUNICATIONS.
1 he complainings and-forrows, the pathetic apo
strophes of monsieur Adet'a note, and indead of
all the eh we hare been blelt with, remind one of
the tender exclamations of the hag-killer in the
poem, to the pi;j that squeals and flares when the
knife is at his throat.
" why kickâwhy fqnealâbe still!
" W'ont you be kill'd and cured a little ?"
It was early predicted that an energetic national
government waÃ necessary in this country for the
ptirpofe of checking the inroads of foreign influence
through the individual state governments. It was
forefeeÃ that if the states held their foveteignty in
an independent capacity, it would be no very im
probable thing that a foreign power should cor
rupt demagogues fufficient in number and popularity
to bend th? measures of their government to foreign
machinations- That this mighty evil would pro
bably hÂ»Â»e happened either from corrupt motives,
or from ignorance, a few events within the lall
have clearly manifetted. Among the
laieft we hear of is the inttance mentioned in a let
ter (lately published in the Gazette of the United
States) from South-Carolina. If it be true that
Charles Pincknf.y, the governor of that Hate,
declared (as is therein asserted) in his inauguration
fpeecti, that the federal government had behaved
moji infamovjly to the FreÃch, and that he hoped
that the brench wouldfoon bring us to a ferfe of our
political errors, it is deeply to be lamented that the
evil intended to be guarded againfl could ndt be
\nU\c\y prevented as well as cured. That the mif
chief arifmg from such a remark loses all its tting
from the ignorance of him who was capable of
making it, is a consolation it is true ; but it like
wise proves how essential it is to have a government
mnving on great, uniform, aud exalted national prin
ciples, whose authority may palsy into-dei'erved
impotence the Ji; tie tyrant who 'might wi/h to em
broil his own country from luve of a foreign land !
A certain tyrant of antiquity had s singular
punishment that at once evinced bis love of the fine
art!, and his refined tajle Jor cruelty. He had a
piece oftT)achasifm rxquifitely executed in the forth
of a beautiful woman. Wlifn his friends offended,
he ccinfigned them to the arms and embraces of
this lovely automaton, which by the touch of cer
tain springs clasped the beloved friend in her Jiily
arms, and fque&ed him to death ! Mr. Adet
and hii fraternal amateurs have attempted ta cul
tivate a taste for this species of the fine artsâ
Tearsâembracesâexquisite sensibilityâthe molt
endearihg small talkâThe lovely automaton for ever
held up to viewâaud nothing wanting to fct her
arms in motion but a firm basis for her fret to reft
on, that her embraces and squeezes may be felt by
the lutly and tree sons of America.

The Hon. the Legislature of this state, now conven
ed 'n Albany, made a quorum of both houses on Tues
day the 3d inft. We have detailed the most raateriaJ
parts of their proceedings.
The following resolution faffed the Striate of this State,
.4* the 4th infant.
Resolved, if the hon. the A/lembly concur there
in, that a joint committee of both houses fce v ap
pointed, to consider and repott, with all conveni
ent speed, what arrangements may be requisite to
render the monies which now are, and may from
time to time be paid into the treasury, preduftive
as income to the Kate : and further o devise and
report, whether any and what arrangements are ne
cessary for the better management and disposition
of the funds of the state. The afiembly concurred.
The committee arc MefTrs. Schyylet, Jones and
Caotii.c of the Senate, and Meflrs, Kent, Mason,
Ryersj Co.mftock and Blaachard of the afietnbly.
The proposition between Lord Malmfbury and the
Fier.ch Executive Directory amounts to but little im
portance, itniefs we admit that the comicfcenfion of
ta king more fully to each other in town, has, as the
Diretflory exprefsts it, somewhat of a mare amicable
appearance than the former overtures, made by Mr.
Wickhkm. i hat the King of Prsffia will.eventually,
hold a language in favor of the Stadtholdcr's reinftate
rflcnt we have no doubt of, and have formerly ventur
ed to predict.
A resolution is moved in the llotife of Reprefenta
lives, to enquire into title of the United State# to land
weft of the state of Pennfyhania. This business will
probably end with the firft motion ; but the prppofi
tion is a proof what a knack some men poflefs of mak
ing mifchief.âSuppofe another member ihould move
to appoint a committee to enquire into the title of -the
state of New-York, to lands weitof the Delaware.â
Some of our pert motion makers would have a talk on
hand to fatisfy enquiries on that point. Men who
love union and harmony will be flow to open the
wounds which are healed, or to intrude into the ju
diciary department to find sources of contention.

CAUTION.
WHEREAS very Urge and heavy debts are justly
due and owing from mefirs. Bla;r M'CUnachan and
Patrick Meore, of the city of Philadelphia, merchants,
trading under the Brm of Blair M'Clenachan and P.
Moore, and from Blair M'Clenachan in his separate
capacity j to which, by the laws of the land, all the
joint as well as separate property of the said Gentle
men, is, and ought to be, liable. And whereas
it is clearly and fatisfafforily ascertained, that mr.
Blair M'Clenachan, of the said firm, lias eonveyc.l
away to mr. yobn 11. Hujlon, his son-in-law, to his
daughter, rail's M'Clenachan, and to his son, George
M'Clenachan, federal large and valuable real estates,
as well as aoufiderable personal property, in the city
artd county of Philadelphia, in the county of Lancas
ter, in the county of New-Cattle on Delaware, and
elsewhere, with a view, as it is apprehended, to de
feat the Creditors in the recovery of their just debts.â
This is, therefore, to forewarn alt persons whamfo
evcr, againlt thepurchafe from the said grantees, or
either of them, of any portioa of the said real or per
sonal property, as the most vigorous measures will
without delay be taken to render the fame liable to
the jttft demands of the Creditors.

TO THE PUBLIC.
| THE caution introduced into the public prints,
I warning all perfonr, against purchaliog from the
granteeiof Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and petfonal eftatei he conveyed away to
his fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upon the fubjeft by a general and
; numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Cleno-
I chan individually. It was no more than an execu
j tion of that trust confided in the fubferibers by
! those creditors : a step which it would have been a
' breach of duty and honor in them to have omitterl.
i The very ftatcment of the faÂ£t therefore mutt dif
! pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
lor vindiQive." It originated in a desire to secure
J the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
-1 ment of his just debts. It was fancSh'oned by the
advice of council as a measure necessary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the adveuiferaent has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjuftiliajjle conduct, not to the fub
feribers Â«vho have merely published the truth in
terms as mild as the fatt would admit, and who
mean to iuveftigate in a high court of justice the
validity of thole purcbafes of which Mr. M'Cle
nachan fa confidently speaks. <
The fubferibers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
eaution against purohafing of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
purchase from any other persons (if such there be)
to whem Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
conveyances.
