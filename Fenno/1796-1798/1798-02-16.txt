AT a junfture when the question of
a Commercial Treaty ivith Franc* may soon
become an object of difcu/lion, a work of this kind
becomes extremely ufeful to those citizens of the
United States, who may be defirons to enable them
selves to view this fubjeck, under its various af
pe<sb ; and they will have the fatisfadion to be
furnifhed with the necessary data, to jttdge of the
ufefulnefs of this tranfadlion.
This work is principally diftingiifhed by the
richness of the obfervauons, the pcrfpicuity of th#
and the modesty of the theory which Jt
contains. At Pars, a man of wit observed, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufelul produce. Uis addref â¢
fed to the unfortunate La Favette, in letters,
which fugitive form, the author who "could only
devote a few wef ks to this occupation, was obliged
to adopt. Although circumlbnc;s art ill many
refpe&s different at the present day, from what
they were in the year 1790, when these letters
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so ma
ny abfelate and permanent data still remain, that
the judicious reader Will not appreciate the work
lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
fblt of the author's remarks, it will fervc to con*
vmce him that in all tranfa&ioris, between free
nations, every thing maybe expe&edfrom the ef

LETTER 111.
Eflay in the form of a tableau, to appraise the im
doi tai ions into the Upited Slates from France and tng
land united. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better furuifhed from France or
Englandâlt is principally .On this fobjeft (which
would have aftonifoed a meie thcorirt) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kind of tableaux, uuluckily as difficult to obtain as
they are much to be defned, are the only sure guides
the flatefman can take for th policy ot treaties, de
prived of which lie is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We cÂ»nnot too much admire the apparent ex
a&nefs of colonel Swarf's calculations ; and although
the propUefies of Lord She (Held have already been
contradi&ed by experience, and by feverai able pens,
yet it is curious to fee the author of the present work,
dispute with him the only ground on which be has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the tequived condition, will be better able
than Gie2t Britain to supply us with fcveral articles,
which thÂ« English author allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's pa?tiality cjfefl on (tf he
! has any) does hot appear to have at any time created
a partiality of judgment. The result of this calculation
is that in 1789, that is to fay, at a period when arts
and manufactures did 001 prefect in France the valE
means and probability of exter.fion which they now
possess. that even in 1789, it waa prefumablc, that
France would not only have the meaos to supply one
half of any given auantity of th* prodtons of France
and t ngland united, butalfoto enter into cqmpctition
with Great Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wildom of her government, and the indulkry
of her inhabitants.
LETTER IV.
Calculation of the cxportations of the United States,
and particular examination of their suitableness to
France; this is one reason why, notwithstanding the
rxcelhnt work of Mr. Tench Coxe, Mr. Swan's ta
bleau is by no means fupcrfluous . the principle of the
advantages which would result to France Jrom the
importation of provision* and raw materials, is every
where applied ; and it is upon this argument, that
the author eftabliihcs his demands to rhe French go
vernment, for the limited admi&on of the produc
tionsoi his country into France-.
LE ITER V.
Tableau, of the debt of the United States at that
timeâOpmirns of the author on the finances, on the
effects of national debt, r>n circulation, &c. as more
amply detailed in his National Arithmetic printed at
Burton in the year 1786 ; the whole calculated to
strengthen in France, rhe puV>l c and private credit

LETTER VI.
General examination ot the defe&Â» of the commer

many ol these obfervatioos have produced the effeffcs
for which they iwere intended, others dill remain,
pointing out the reforms to be made in future, as a
good chart marks the shoals and rocks. The author
conclades his work,' by fixing his attention on bis
country, and the great men who have rendered it il
lustrious; and wc take a ptcafure in quoting what he
fays of the present chief of our government. To
praise a man when he exercises a diilinguifhed em

but whilst he is in private life, ii is the homage of

tO MMUMCA TIONS.
The lights of every clafi of citizens de.
pend on supporting the Constitution of the
â  United States ; bat every enemy of the
| constitution is more the enemy of the. poor,
' than of the rich. To ele& to office the en
emies of the conftitiition, is to betray the
interests of the majority of the people ;
for the Constitution is the barrier that pro
tests them from the encroachments of wealth
and power. Those therefore who advocate
the eleftios of the known enemies of the
constitution, whatever they may pretend,
are the worst enemies of the middling, in
dustrious, peaceable, and thriving part of
the citizens.
A viler and more unfounded calumny
was never uttered than this, that the friends
of the constitution and government of the
United States, who advocate the eleftion of
Benjamin R. Morgan, are ariftocracy,
who seek. to deprive the people, or any de
scription of them of their rights. All our
senses centradift thefalftiood. " Tht rich
tndpour meet togetherâthe Lord is the maker
of then all." Look round and round and
round th.s city; behold how mutually de
pendent are every class on each other. We
stand or fall together. The enemies of the
rich, are the enemies of the poor : cleft to
office the enemies of men of property, and
public confidence ii shaken to the founda
tionâthe springs of society are interrupted;
the sources fail; industry sickens, poverty
and universal distress ensue, and man becomes
the enemy of his species. Of all the arts
praftifed by demagogues to raise themselves
to power, there is none so base, treacherous,
mifcliievous and deftruftive, as that which
draws a line of political diftindioa between
the rich and the poorâgenerating jealousies
fufpicit.-Ms, ill-will and bloodftied among
citizens whofc interests Â«re infcparable, and
whose union can alone in fare their happi
ness.
MR. FEN KO,
I think tht views of the French party
cannot be set in a fairer point of view, than
they wers a few evenings finec, at a meet
ing of a number of patriots, held at Lex
er's tavern, at which citizen Barker prefidtd
âThe business being opened by the said
citizen in a speech recommending the talents
integrity and patriotism ojf Israel Irael, and
calling on all the friends of liberty and e
quality to exert themselves at the ensuing
elr&ion for a senator. This oracle of the
party, this standard of conclu
ded his harangue with the following fen
tcnee : " Notu is the timeâif ive carry Is
rael Israel, â¢wejhall hereafter, lile Buonaparte,
conquer all before us." This being the de
termination of .the .French party, ii is Lcer
tainly the duty of every gocd citizen to op
pose these Buonaparte men, who now pub
licly declare, what thay have never ventur
ed to declare before, that their determina
tion is, like their great leader, to overturn
every kind of order, and eftabli/h a govern
ment of their own. v

But is this potest Abracadabra to lock

A man may be an afTafiiaâhe may repeat

yet call hiraftlf, (and perhaps even think
himfelf) a Republican. He may be a trai

wilh for the fucccfs of his country's foes.)
He may be a constant reviler of the patri
ots, heroes and ftatefisen who atchieved the
independency of the Uaited States, and

TUB DIGNITY OF GOVERNMENTâNÂ«. I.
" The glory of men does out consist in pow
er, in wishes, in length of years, or grey hairs,
but in wisdom."
If men were what they frtfefs to be, govern
ment would be what it jbouli be, in which al'
perfsns and all interests 6nd equal pro
tection : hi the firft efiiblilnrr ent of a free re
public, the people always anticipate fueb a go
vernment, and under its benign inflaence they
entertain the pleasing hope that universal harmo
ny and contentment will pervade the happy
land. Such were our anticipations: foraltho'
the history of all the living aad the dead na
tions allured that no great people ever enjoyed
futb national felicity, yet we supposed that our
superior political light which the energy of the
revolution had kindled in the human mind, the
republican principles instilled into American
minds in their early education, and above all
the general reading of the Scriptures in this
country and the influence of the true maxims
of morality they contain, had made us a new
rEofLt âthat we were politically and morally
" born again". Hence we concluded that we were
alike fecurcd from the follies and the fate of o
ther nations. Here the human charaAer was to
expand iu all the glory attached to the final dif
tinllion of man âand expiring patriots who at
chieved the revolution were to be soothed in
their latest moments with this hop*. What

which once palpitated with rising joy fink with
in themâand their inspiring hopes fall back
on thiir minds ? Is not the lover of his country
flung to the foul jn viewing the dtvifions which
retard the progress of every good ! Is he not
juflly agita ed with fears left the fame defliny
awaits our country which his sealed the deduc
tion ot all others I
May the Parent of the UnivefTe call back
every American mind to our " firft love"âto
love our country with an afleAion stronger than
ali the wayward paflionsâto point all our ener
gies to the path of wisdomâto silence every
tenguethat moves not in virtue's causeâthat all
â¢f every ailion who dwell here ir.ay lose diflinA-
iors in tl:e American nameâbecome her Tons
an.l daughters and (bare alrke iti the bleffirt;.'S
whieh Heaven may have in rrferve for an unit

Â©f freemen and friend of the world.
Let the rulers in every department search
and try their own wayi by the ftanHard of truth,
" whatever ye would men (hould do tcyou, do
ye so to them. This it at all times neceflary,
as it is said by high authority, " that folly has
a corner even in the hea't of the wife."
Let a.) the their hearts, fa fee if
they have ailed upon pure-principles ia their
eleftitus, and in fuppnrting, or oppnfing the ru
lers j let them alfa try their conduit by the a
bove divine rule. There cannot be a doubt that
pure principles are as eflential in the people as
in the rulers, and that fÂ«eh a people and such
only will have wife-men to rule over them. It
is idleto.be careless in regard to eledior.s. and
clamour igainft the measures of government j
ignorance only can entertain the hope t\f reformâ 
ing hail rulers âThe only security in the power
of the people, is to be vigilant at their elefiions,
(unless the government is to be destroyed) ;
here they ought to exert all their sagacity in a
close txaminatim of the political charailer of
the candidates, and also the tniral cboralfer, as
an immoral man never ought to be trusted with
power.
It is also very effestial to the preservation of
a free government, that there be great cautirau
in bringing charges wf mifcondiiit against rulers,
for if fair# accusations are frequently made and
refuted, the people will not duly regard an ac
eufation aga'nftabad man which is founded in
truthâBesides, good men are often deferred
from accepting an office when they may be ex
pnfrd to abuse from licentious tongues and pens.
This deserves the furious attention of Americans,
as liberty is evidently :n danger from the abuse
good men in office are liable to, and in too ma
ny inftanses received. Besides, it degrades and
vulgariaes the manners of a free people, it nou
r (hes the evil passions and prepares them for sla

THURSDAY, r BRUARY 15.
Mr Dwight Foster from the committee of
claims, made an unfavourable report on the pe
tition of Thomas Lewis, aid-de-camp to gene
ral Wayne, which was read and ordered to lie
on the table.
The bill granting 4he right of franking let
ters to the Attorney. General and the officer
commanding the troops of the United Sutes,
was read the third time and pal Ted.
i'he house again resolved itfelf into a com
mittee of the whola on the report of the com
mittee of claims on the fubjeit of extending the
provision allowed to the widows and orphans of
certain officers of the army of the United States,
to the widows and orphans of those who were
killed in aÂ£lion with the Indians in the territory
north weft of the Ohio, on the 14th Novem
ber, 1791 , when the proposition made yester
day for extending the provision to the widows
and orphans of all officers who have died in the
service of the United States, not at present pro
vided for, was agreed to. The committee rose,
the house concurred in the amendment, and the
committee of claims was dire&ed to bring in a
bill accordingly.
Mr. Livingfton said, the delegates from the
state of New-York, had received inflruiiions
from the legislature of that state, to use their
endeavours to get removed a difficulty which
existed in a suit now pending, in which there
was a elafhing of jurifdiftiou between the slates
of New-York and Connecticut. In order to
remove this difficulty, and others of a similar
nature, in future, he prepofed a refolation to
the following effefl :
" Resolved that piovifion ought-to be made
by law allowing the trial of all cases in which
one or more states may be interested, by a ju
ry to be taken from a state not interested in
such suit or fails."
Ordered to lie on the table.
The Speaker noticing that the uafinifhed bu
siness, of the bill providing the means of foreign .
intercourse, was firft in order,
Mr. Dent moved to postpone the confedera
tion of that business until Monday, as from the
appearance of the house, he did not think it
would be proper to go into so important a fuh
jeft at present.
After a few other observations, the question
for postponement was carried 44 to 34
Mr. Livingfton, from the committee of com
merce and manufaflures, repei ted a bill for the
relief of Sylvanus Crowell, which was commit
ted for Monday.
The fame gentleman, from the fame com
mittee, also made a report on the petitions -of
Reuben Smith and Nathan Strong, who pray to
be allowed the bounty and drawback on a quan
tity of beef, pork and cotton goods exported,
which had been regularly infpefled, but upon
the exportation of which the neceflary bond had
nut been given, nor the oath prescribed taken.
The committee state that the negleit does not
appear to have taken place from -ny improper
motive, and therefore recommend that the re
lief prayed for may be granted. Committed
for Monday.
On motion of Mr. Gregg, the house went
into a committee of the whole on the âº"!! tor
the relief of William Alexander j which being
agreed to without amendment, the committee
rose and the bill was ordered to he read a third
time to-morrow.
On motion of Mr. Livingfton, the house
went intÂ« a committee of the whole on the bill
in addition to the aA for the rtlief and
ion of Americas fcamen ; when, after Mr. L
had introduced an amendment, requiring mast
ers of vessels ttr give bond to bring back, or
give a due account of all the sailors they take
out on their voyages, the committee rose ; but
some objections being offered to this amendment
in the house, the consideration of it was postpon
ed, and ordered to be printed.
Mr. Dwight Foster then moved to adjourn.
Mr. Dawfon wiHied the motion for adjourn
ment to be withdrawn until he offered a resolu
tion the house.
The motion for adjounfment-was perfided in,
and negatived, there being only 23 votes in fa
vour of it.
Mr. Dawfon then proposed a resolution to
the following effeCi, which he wiflied to be re
ferred to tr.e committee appointed to consider
upon the propriety of making certain amend
rfaeuts in the Handing rales and orders of the
house:
" Resolved that the (landing rules and or
ders of this house, be amended by adding to
them a provision, that prrions attending this
house to take down i's debates and procicd
ingK for the purpose of publication, lhall be
per mitted to take their places within the bar of
the house."
The Speaker said, he would state to the house,
that this was now the cafe, except as to one
who had abused the privilege, and in
tuited the speaker of the house.
The resolution was ordered to lie upon the
table. / Adjourned.

On Sunday lad arrived the American (hip

On the 28th Â«lt. the Harmony fell in with
the fleet under conroy of Admiral Rainier
ia lat. 4, north, and long. 87 âall well.
The Harmony left at the Cape the fol

MAURITIUS.
Letters from Tranquebar, dated the ift
iridant, mention the arrival of ? small Da
ni(h veflel, from Mauritius, after a paflage
of 42 days.
Accounts received by the above vefiel
(late, that Admiral Siercie, remained in
port at the period of her departure, that the
guns of his squadron were landed, and that
the frigate La Regenere, having been
found leaky had been hauled into the Careen
age for repair.
It appears that Siercie had, whilst at Ba
tavia, buried 600 men, and had left 90 in
the hospital at that place.
An American (hip the Apollo, had been
fitted out as privateer, and had proceeded
to sea on the 14th of March.
One of the letters from which we have
derived the above has the fol
lowing pi&urefque defeription of Siercie's
squadron, on its arrival from Batavia, Itc.
" They have brought in a great number
of prizes andpr'ifuncrt from Batavia, confid
ing of Trees, Flowers, and other curiod
ties of the Island of âthe prisoners,
Monkeys, Baboons and Birds, of all defcrip
tiont in great abundance, the squadron when
they arrived, reminded me of a defcriptioti
of Noah's Ark, or of the Bounty Store
(hip, transporting the Bread Fruit Plant,
instead of a squadron of armed ships."
"Every thing was quiet at Mauritius,
and little I believe thought off, but how
they {hould cheat the world and each other:
quite relaxed in their mock-difeiplineâno
exercising of National guards, Icc. the
Guillotine lurnt, no trees of liberty decorated
with the lonet rouge, yet ire they not with
out their fears of being called to a future
account for their treatment of the National
CommiiEoncrt."
July 19.
Yesterday arrived the American (hip Bel
ifarius, Crewninfhield, -from America and
Mauritius.
Whether intelligence novel or important
has been brought by the above ve(el r we
know not, the captain not having landed at
the time of this paper's going to press.
The well known Cuthhert Fenwick, eap
tured some time fincc by Siercie's squadron,
has returned to the Prince of Wilei-iflasd,
from Batavia.
Two (hips under the colours of Tippoo
Sultaun, are likewise said to have arrived at
that port. Conje&ures Â»n this held were
various. One of the vessels was formerly
the Latchme, a rich and valaable (hip,
bound to Manilla, captured long since, on
her passage to that port.
A small vessel, with two Frenchmen on
board, had also arrived at the island, and
reported themselves as belonging to the Mo
ri ede, and that they were in want of pro
vision and water. On examining their boat
however, some ca(ks of fait provisions and
plenty of water were found on board.
They were well entertained Â«n the island,
and it was at one time proposed to fend
them in the St. Lewis to Calcutta ; but as

From Tooi/g'i EiSai,
ON
I-IBIRTT AND Equality.
* What !" fay our modern innovators,
" fifcall wc be precluded from seeking the re- [
lircfj of bur grievance!, in what way, or bv
mains we pltafe ? Are not Liberty and E
qiÂ«':ity the natural rights of men ? And who
IhaSi deprive us of the one or the other."
.Liberty is, doubtless one of the molt valu- j
*hli earthly bleflings ; but, like all others, ;
it ij liable to be abused. Often has it been
(aÂ«d oft.cn is) employed as a cloke of licen
"tiouinefs ; but it is only of late that it has
beÂ«a coupled with Equality ! Let us exa
mine, with candour, this new association.
Liberty is one of those things of which
eÂ«ery man has some kind of conception, but
which no Â«un finds it easy to define. Patting
over the various descriptions that have been
given of it, it is manifeft that perfeft liber
ty must confilt inâan unlimited power of
doing what one pleases ; or, of following
the diftates bf one'tcvn will without any
restraint from without himfelf. But it ise
qually manifeft that this fort of liberty is
competent to God only ; because none but
he has a right'to make his owh will the sole
rule of his actions. But at all men, whe- '
ther faints or sinners, while in this lift, have !
much corruption about them, their wills '
must always be inclined, more or less, to
what is contrary to God's will, and is pro
hibited by his law. That law, therefore,,
will always prove a great restraint Hpon the
liberty of mortals. Suppofmg mankind to.
be in what is called the ftatc of nature, be
fore the formation of society, ortheenafti
on of government of any kind ; in that cafe
man was under any (abjection to the will
â¢f any ftllowcreature, nor was his will un
der any other restraint but the law of na
ture. Even in that Jlate be could have no
right f iill, to'lit, or do any thing else which
God in that law had forbidden. Thus ev
ery man would have had an tinreftrained
right to follow his own will, as far as it was
agreeable to the law of nature. Arid this
is, precisely, what ought to be called natu
ral liberty. s
Though this natural liberty can never be
inrr;uf;d by any human institution ; becaule
men can never have power to abolilh, or to
lessen the obligation of the law of God ;
yet this liberty may be abridged by human
authority ; and must be so, wherever soci
ety exists. When any number of men set
up any form of government among them
selves, they must not only fix certain regu
lations, at the firft, according to which they
will be governed, but they must likewise es
tablish, in some hand or other, a power of
making laws for time to come. Every mem
ber of that society must give up his natural
liberty so far, as not only to submit to the
fundamental regulations formally agreed to
by the whole, but also to the will of those
who form the legislature in the society, in
all things that are not contrary to the law
of natufe : But he parts with this portion
of his natural liberty, only upon condition
of his being so protested by the community,
or by those to whose hands the administra
tion is entrusted, {hat none may have pow
er to lay any restraint upon his will, but what
is laid upon him by the laws of God or of
his country. This is what has been called
civil liberty. Hence it is manifeft, that no
fflan in the due. erercife of reason, will ever
claim ffie unrcftrained use of natural liberty
jn the social Hate. The will of every indi
vidual must be fubjedl to the public will.â
But if the government is rightly conftit'utcd,
every one has a fufficicnr compensation for
that portion of his liberty which he gives
â¢p, in the protection which he enjoys under
the wings of the law. And no man has
ground to complain, while no restraint is
l\id upon him by the public will, but what
ilfor the general good-
Every oneknows that all governments 3re
rot alike friendly to liberty. Some .allow
the fnbjett to retain a greater share of his
natural liberty, and some a less. A n *l that
government is always the best, wkere most
of it is fuffered to remain, ptovided the
ends of government ars gained. Thi< is the
â¼try thing, that, above all others, shews the
excellence of government, and constitutes
Eritifh liberty. We are not only secured I
against fubjcAion to the will of any man,
or any set of men, contrary to law ; but
the law itfelf allows us to follow the dic
tates of our own will in more cases, and lays
us under fewer reftrainti, than the laws of
any other country do. A British fubjeft
may do with himfelf, and with all that is
bis uwn, just what he pleases, so long as he
does no injury to his fellow-fubjeÂ£ts, or to
the constitution at large.
It is likewiff evident, that h is impoffibb
to frame any government in fueh a manner,
as that.all who live under it (hould be alike
frÂ«e. Suppofmg a government so perftfl as
to have every law eaa&ed, that could con
duct to the good of the nation, and no more,
it is evident, that the man who was most
disposed to promote the public good would
always have most liberty ; because, in doiag
what he pleased, he would just do what the
law reqaired. On the other hand, if there
existed in that aation, an enemy to his coun
tiy, or one who wifbed to promote his own
interest, by injuring or opprefliag hie fel
low fubjedts, that man would live under
continual restraint. He would be a slave in
the midlt of a fre* nation ; because be could
ucv:r follow his own will, without tranf
greffir.g the laws. Hence it follows, that
uader every jood government, the most vir
tuous man is always tht most free ; anj the
ruoft wicked will always be under the great
est retrain!. They among us who (ince the
days of Wilkes and liberty have
clamorous for more liberty, hive been the
very persons who have Rood most in need of :
the rrftraints of the law.
Having said thus much of liberty, let us ;
raw tafce a view of herbaflard filter Equalâ¢ \
â¢Â». But here, lam afraid t we have got '
.'â¢Veus by th*- neck. can tell
â¢ â¢ this Equality is, that some meu
plead for. If wihirit.it <L*,> in on; Diane,
it in tantly aftame-s
not what wc are contending about.
If they only mean, that every good fub
jeÂ£t should enjoy an equal (hare of Civil Li
berty, an equal protection of Law, and an
equal fecurLy for his person and property,
this kind of Equality we all admit: and
thanks to kind Providence we all enjoy it,
unless we have forfeited it by our crimes.
What can human wisdom do more, to set
us upon an equal footing, unlet there was
an equal division of property between us?
Such an Equality of property,we are told,
they do not plead for; and nÂ» man of un
-derftanding will plead for it. It may easily
be believed, that the leaders of our affocia
tionsi, if they could succeed in their ambiti
oui views, would wish to keep the largcft
(hare of the property to themselves. But
no jjerfon can be ignorant, that many of the
deluded people whom they have prevailed
with to join their focietics, and fubferibe
their papers, look forward to such an equal
ization of property, as one effedt of the re
form expedted; and this profpedt is the prin
cipal thing that engages them to the cause.
Some tell as that what they contend for,
is an equal eligibility to places of power and
trust under government ; and this also, in a
proper sense, we enjoy. 'The law, indeed,
requires certain qualifications, in those who
pofTefs such places; but any fubjeft may
enjoy thesn, upon qualifying himfelf as the j
law direfts. Seceder, as I am, there is no
law to prevent his majesty from appointing
me prime minister. And if he does, I have
it in my choice, either to accept the appoint
ment, and qualify myfelf for it, by taking
the oaths, as the law direfts, or adhere to
my principles, and refufe the appointment,
because I will not qualify. I hare only to
choose whether I lhall enjoy riches, and hon
or, and power, at tlje expence of my prin
ciples, or keep a clear conscience and con
tinue as I am. To be a minister of state is
none of the natural and unalienable rights of
man; and lam deprived of none of my rights
by being kept from that office.
But why should we contend about a Phan
tom? And what else but a Phantom is this
Eligibility ? What avails it to me, that no
law precludes rae from an office for which
nature never qualified me, or from which
providence has set me at such a distance,
that I can never have any reasonable hope
of enjoying it ? ,Unless we are influenced by
ambition, or some other principle equally
fordid, this kind of Equality will never be
considered by us, as anobjedt worth contend
ing about; much less an objeft, on acoount
of which we may embroil our country, or
involve it iu anarchy and coafufion.
Our friends must acknowledge that they
who are entrusted with the supreme power,
in any nation, must have a right to nominate
whom they think most proper, to inferior
offices under them: and they cannot lay that
any man is deprived of his right, because he
is palled by in fach nomination. Or will
they maintain, that though no roan can be
born a king, one may be born a minister of
state, n judge, or a general in the army ?
They must likewise allow, "that layvs may
be made without injustice, excluding men,
who are acknowledged good fubjedts, from
certain places of power, trust or dignity in
the state. Is not a feat in the House of
Commons a place of as high trust, as any
that the nation has to bellow ? Would they
think it reasonable that Peers, officers of
Excise, or Commiflioners of the Cuftoias,
should be rendered eligible to a feat in that
house ? .Or do they think that a man's be
ing an Excise officer or commiflioner of the
Culloms, deprives him of any of the invio
lable rights of Man ?
But the most rational account of this e
quality which is now argued for is, that it
confifh in an equality of power, or politi
cal influence. The sovereignty, and all the
power of the state is radicallly in the peo
ple. This power the people ought to retain
in their own hands. And if it were shared
by all the people, every individual would be
I-8000,000th part of a King. But as wc
(hall be allowed to cut off all women and
children, and probably all menial servants,
the number of those who have a claim to
the rights of men, may be computed at two
millions. The sovereignty therefore must
be divided into as, many (hares ; and of th'efe
every active citizen is to pofTefs one. Doubt
less this will be very just, when once we
have all government abolished, and ourselves
reduced to that state of barbarism, towards
which our neighbors are faft verging. But
â¢even if this were attained, an important
question will arise, whether each (hall retain
his portion of sovereignty in his own hands,
or whether it /hall be deputed in the hands
of representatives ? It is very probable that
one part of the sovereign people will be for
the one method, and another part for the
other. ,If it is agreed that the sovereignty
is to be exercised by representatives, then
equality is already deflroyed. Each repre
sentative is conllituted a legislator, he is
invested with as many portions of the so
vereignty, as there wore adtive citizens who
had a vote in choosing him ; while his elec
tors themselves fink into mere fubjedts. But
suppose it is only meant, that every man
should have an equal right to 3lec\, and an
equal iafluence in eleftions ; let us fee if c
ven tbis be poflible. Igo to the place of
eledtion, without connections, without de
pendents, and without any thing to support
my opinion, but the honesty of my inten
tions. But I have a rich neighbor, who
happens to be in the opposite interest. He
comesattended with tenants and dependants,
who all know that lie can turn them out
from their farms or places, if they do not
vote as he docs. Where now is the equali
ty between him slid me ? It cannot cxift
without an equality of property.
\ Suppose this likewise obtained. All mea
come to the place of election upon a level:
no one is worth on<? farthing more than a
nather : and with pet fedt equality the elec
tion is got through. But before the year's
end, ciic man has fquzndered his allotment
of property in-riot and difT.patinn, aâ >? a
not her has doubled his by laud ible induftr.y.
Before 3 new eledlion, we m;ilt h*Â»e a new j
division of property. The indultrious man j
into be robbed oflhe fruit of his labor, and I
it must become the property of him who is I
a pest to society, that at the eledlion they j
may have equal influence. Suppofc this j
newdivifionmade; (fornothingisimpoffib'eto i
a sovereign mob) the dissipated wretch hap
pens to be a man at abilitieÃ, can speak, and
knowjhowtowork upon thepaffionsofa mul
titude : the roan of industry is a blunt honest
fellow, who contents himfelf with faying aye
or no. The firft makes a vehement harangue
in favor of some unworthy candidate of his
own kidney, and is followed with huzzjs
and acclamations Â«f Paine for ever ! The
other can only fay, " Gentlemen I vote for
such a man, becaafe I know him to be an
hone ft man and a friend to hit country j''
and nobody attends to him. The libertine, ;
of consequence carries the ele&ion by a great .
majority, and the friend of his, country is
rejefted. Thus to maintain an equilKy of j
influence, even in annual eleilions, we mÂ«ft â 
not only have an animal division of proper- j
ty, we must also bring over dame nature to !
our scheme, and obtain from her a decree,
that all men shall have equal abilities, ..or,
which will be much fafer, shall be born
dunces. In one word, if we are not fatis
fied. with that fort of equality we already
enjoy, I know no other species of it, that
ran fubftft one month, among mankind, ;
while natural talents, acquirements, and ac- ;
eomplifhments. are so Unequally distributed.

By a Gentleman who arrived at Wilming

that on the 25th Dec. last, 65 launches
were fitted, out, and manned with 900
soldier* and 200 men fromon board theEng
lifh shipping at the Mole. They proceeded
at 9, A, M. to the Platform, undef the com
mand of captain White, of the ship CarnaÂ«
tic, and at 4, P. M. commenced an aÂ£lion,
which compelled the French to retreat. The
English then burnt the buildings, together
with 500 bbls. flour and other provisions,
burst their gunt, Itc. On their return, those
1 boats that were nearest the fliore, were fired
upon from thence with small arms, by a par
ty of the French who lay in ambush. One
iieut. and seven men were killed on board
the launches, besides several wounded. The
French had 18 killed and wounded.
Great preparations are making by our

Translated Extraft from a paper entitled
s _ Moniteur de la Louifiane, printed at New
Orleans, dated Jan. Is, 1798.
Jt " The Governor of this province having '
j ; received by the last Courier the orders of â >
' his Majesty to evacuate the forts of Walnut c
j Hills and Natchez, immediately took pro
per measures for their execution, having r
~ sent off the necessary advices for Natchez." J
The above leaves no doubt of the impor
tant faÂ£l of the evacuation of our polls by A
the Spanish. The Gazette containing the !
article we have seen.
T1 n
f Extra& of a dated New-Orleans, Jan- 11
m uary. 16, to a pei'fon in this city.
"j Orders have been received from the court "
Â»Â» of Spain to deliver up the posts without a- 11
>r r.y delay, and the garrison of Walnut-Hil!
J- and Natchen will evacuate those places on
J' the news reaching them. The orders have
's come by the September Packet, via the
?r Havanna and have relieved the Governor *
>s from the greatefl difficulty he ever experien
d ccd.
it Tl\f deniareation'of limits will take place
y it is supposed in March. This information
:c haÂ» not yet been officially announced here, 5
re although an express was sent with the news
o two days ago to Natchez.
Tht following Resolution pajfed the Senate of
J- the United States on Wednesday lajl.

a- the chajlifement heflowed ly Mr. Grifwold on
Lyon, tupafs without fame of his Newgate ernbel- ! j
le lifhment. The account given by you in lafl even- j c
c- ln Z' s Gazette, is accurate as far as it goes ; â 
.y. but it omits the eircuteftance of Lyon's fe'ming X
|( j the tongs for defense, andalfo the attach made
lt by Lyon on Mr. Grifwold, after the termina
tien of the fracas. Sts to the toijs, the facts J
are thefe âLyon, nfter undergoing, without an f,
in attempt at refiffance or defence, a handsome df-
IC cipliue from Mr. Grifwold's hickory, he hu-
manely avoiding as much as pojftlle to flrile his t
[e head, fought jhelter behind the Speaker's chair. a
3 _ Thither he was pursued by Mr. G. Like a p
confined cat, he now for the firjl time, made (|
feme shew of rejiflancc, and grasped the tongs. v
Mr. Grifwold then closed with him, threw t<
him down with one hand, took the tongs from
t. him, and with the ether, beat him until he was ''
ie taken off, and not, as Lloyd fays, ' until the i]
â 'Â» combatants were separated.' It was literally
a chastisement, and not a combat, and f it
was intended { therefore Mr. G. was under ~
no kind of obligation to call on Lyon to take his
" f iik in hand, and Jlep into the area far aSion. ~
|, As to Lyon's wishing they had been left to fcjtle
t- the business in this way, it is an absurd and
t- barefaced falfhood. He knows Mr. G. could
" have beaten him to atoms, without his having
an opportunity of returning a Jingle blow. ri
r A few minutes after this exercise, Mr. Cl
j,. Grifwold retired to the south fde of the house,
~ and was iu the ad of taking u drink, with the
!!. tumbler in his hand, whin Lyon came, by fur-
1 > prise, upon him, and gave him one blow with >
11 a Jlick, Mr. G. having none. Lyon immcdi- Â£
'' ately retreated backâMr. G's Jlick was put
â j. into his hand by Mr. Si/greaves ; when t numâ¢ *:
,f ber sos gentlemen immediately intcrpofed, the
ie House was called to brder, and Lyon pro'eP.ed c<
it from aftcond chaHifement more exemplary than
11 the JirJl. Poor Lyon then fat himfelf down by
0 the tub of â water in which the dirty tumbhrs
Â° are waived, andfouked and cooled his la'.tered I
n ; face with his handkerchief. Here he aft eared 1 1
,1 forlorn and conhmptille indeed- nut a friend '
il approached or cajoled lim, lut even th. rank'
r- [ tfl foes to order and decency wre afhatned ej â 
c this brother and coadjutor, andpajfed him ly,
