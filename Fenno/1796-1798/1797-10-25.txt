Communication.
L.i a free ftite the bsft inheritance of eve
ry man fliould be the laws and conflitution,
not his cftatc or chattels, and the best pro
perty of the state is the indnftry, talents
and attachment of its inhibitants, not thd
lands they poflefs. The feudal idea of re
gulating eleflions by the pofieflion of pro
perty, or of portions of territory, to which
the people are deemed merely appendages,
is not ytt discarded. LegiGators, and con
stitution mongers, gravely utter the absur
dity that forefts, fields and blad*3 of grass
may be represented by men. The pofTeflion
of property is of itfelf (according to Joel
Barlow J a fufficient advantage, and it is
impolitic, as well as unjnft, to add to' the
advantage, at the expense of labour, in
dustry, and talents, the most valuable re
sources of every community. Nothing less
than a civil offtnee or crime should deprive
a citizen of the right of voting in the ap
pointment of legislators and magistrates,
wno are to determine on happiness and life.
The lands and riches of a country may be
monopolized by a few, while fuffrages and
property have no more natural connexion
than nobility l or fuffrages and military rank.
The power of appointing governors does
not imply ah equality in personal con fide ra
tion or in property : it is founded in the
veafonablenefs of having a choice where
appovitments may restrain our public afti
oirs, and dispose of the fruits of qur indus
try, and our lives. All on such occasions
should be considered equal, and entitled
ftri&ly to equal consideration ; for all com
mit all to the hands of government. The
property and talents of individuals may be
unequal, and private advantages or disadvan
tages arise from them : but in the inter
course of' every community with its govern
ment, every citizen is equally an unit, and
every violation of this equality, whatever
the state is called, is an approach to des
potism.
REMARKS.
There is in the foregoing observations a good
dealpf modern fophiflry. Attachment to the gov
ernment of a country arises from the benefits deri
ved from' the laws which secure life, liberty and
property under that government. These three are
inseparable. To tell those who have no estate or
chattels, that the laws and conflitution ire an inhe
ritance, is too unfubflantial an idea for them to rea
lize ; and to talk of talents and induflry aithe best
prope ty of the (late, apart from the landser other
obje<2s on which those talents and that induflry
are to be exercised, is refining beyond common or
tfeful comprehension. The diflindlions attempted
to be drawn, between property, labor, induflry
and talent*, is invidious. The three la(>, in a free
country, produce the firft ; and this form* the ba
sis of attachment, made valuable ly just and equal
lav s. li In the intercourfi of every community
with its government every citizen is equally a unit,"
fays the communication. This cannot be trueâlf
A pofleffing nothing, neither hdufc nor laud, nor
wife nor child, nor talents nor indu.lry. nor virtue
nor charafl?r, it a unit, can it be said that he en
joys no greater advantage than S, who poiTefling
all that A wants, is nevertheJefs no more than a
unit. The true political equality here is, that His
a unir, and A is a cypher, and ought to remain
so, till circumllanres alter. An equaliiy of this
fort is the word species of despotism ; for it not

ALBANY, Oftobcr 13.
From a Correspondent.
Whiteftown, Oft. 5, 1797.
On Monday the 2d inft. was celebrated
at Fort Schuyler, formerly Fort Stanwix,
f :n modern Rome) a marriage between a
7'ounger branch of the family of St. Law
rence, and an Elder branch of that of
Hudson. This match* so long contem-,
plated by the friends of this state, was
brought to a happy ifTue, in consequence
of the liberal settlement made by the legi\
Mature of this state, as a marriage dower on
the young Lady. The marriage ceremony
was celebrated, under a discharge of can
non, by Mr. Wefton, in behalf of her
guardians, aflifted by some of her other
friends. At the commencement of the ce
remonies, thirteen cannon were fired in honor
of her Guardians, and at the conclusion,
Jixteen as a federal saluteâAster which the
company partook of an elegant dinner, at
the house of Mr. Wefton, by whose able
and judicious conduft the match has been
concluded, where decent hilarity evinced
the joy of the guests on this happy event.
May this match give rife to a numerous
progeny, that may, in some future period,
contribute amply to the support of the pa
rent flock, and enrich the various branches
of this house, as well as the state which has
so judiciously patronized them.
From the IVfflern Centinel, O&oler 3.
We hear from Fort Stanwix that the
canal and locks are completed, and that
yesterday was the day fixed on for the boats
to pass. The formalities of the day we
have not obtained.
CHARLESTON, Oftober 9.
Extra'ft of a letter from captain Edward
Johnson, of the /loop fames, belonging
to Messrs. Blake and Magwood of this
city, dated Naflau, September 20.
" I am sorry to inform yon of my long
paflage from Charleston, and also of my mif
fortunes, On the 22d of August, I was
in lat. 26, long. 77, which was within fix
hours fail of this place, when I was boarded
by the Grouper, which is a Spanish priva
teer, by which I was very hardly treated,
and my vefTel sustained very great damage ;
they kept me on board the privateer 48
hours, during which they robbed my vessel
of every thing worth taking. I received a
llab under my right breast, but, thank God,
it is not dangerous. They carried me back
as far as lat. 29, long. 79, and then put 7
Spaniards on board of her, to carry her to
St. Jago in Cuba. Being unwell, they put
me on board of my own vefTel, where I
found means to get pofleflion of her, and
have brought her in here. lam sorry for
your loss, but it could not be helped, as the
privateer Grouper is the occasion of all the
damage the cargo has received. A great
many American vefTels are brought in here;
they take out whatever is contraband, or
contrary to treaty, and let the veflels go."
A letter dated Mole St. Nicholas, Septtm
ber 23d, 1797, received there by the
sloop General Green, now off Fort John
fton, mentions that
The brig Jerufhia, capt. Ebenezer Giles,
which failed early in June lail, from Bristol
in England, for this port, was captured on
the 31ft of August, by the French frigate
Medusa, commodore Barney, who took her
in tow until the 17th of September; in the
night, off the north fide of the Caucasus, the
tow rope broke, and the Medusa left the
Jerufha, carrying away all her psople and
leaving 8 Frenchmen on board. On thÂ«
iÃtli September the Jerufha was retaken
by the English frigate Aquilon, captain
Crawford, who sent her into the Mole. On
the 19th September, captain Giles made out
his protest, and waited on the judge of the
admiralty, who told him, that he (hould pay
to the captors a salvage of one eighth of the
vessel and cargo.
Captain Giles writes, that he expefis a
part of the cargo will be fold to pay the
ialvage, in compliance with an order of
court, which will bÂ« immediately granted, I
and he will proceed for this port as fooD as
his business is arranged. I 1

An extraci of a letter, from a citizen of
this state, now in Holland, to a chars&cr of
the firft refpeftahilitv in this city, on the

'* 1 hat the negociations now pending
between Britain and France, may possibly
terminate in peace ; that ef the diredtory of
Frac'ce, but one member (Barthelemi) is
friendly to the United States ; of the coun
cil ot five hundred, a majority may be reck
oned well disposed to us than otherwise; that
Ihoukl a peace take place between Britain
and Fiance, it is impoftible to form a judg
ment, of what measures or conduit the di
reÂ£lory wilj .idopt with refpefl to the United
States, an;i it is therefore of the utmost im
portance that we (hould be fully prepared
for the worst, and that our sea-ports and har
bors particularly, ought to bt immediately

between the French directors and the coun

it is uncertain whether the armies will fide

Communication.
Barney and Defchamps, ex-citizens of
the United States, are now in their glory ;
they have each commenced their career with
robbing and plundering our citizens ; the
latter has already gone so far as to attempt
to murder one, and the former, there can be
no doubt, will likewise take advantage of
the firft oppprtum'ty to do the fame. It is
said there has been an exceflive hard gale of
wind to the southward on the 26th of Sep
tember ; it is molt devoutly to be wifljed,
that the vessels of these unnatural, unprinci
pled and unphralelled villains have been
wrecked, and that they with all the horrors
of the (form, are embosomed in the deep, as
food for fillicp, Were they {imply our ene
mies, there would be something wickedly
cruel in such a with, but they are the ene
mies of nature.
Citizen Commodore, had you at any time
after becoming Frenchman quit pickaroone
ry, made good your boailings, fought out
the enemies of your newly adopted country
and fought them, your quondam country
men, the Americans, and your eternal ene
mies, the Englijh, would have done justice to
your courage and applauded your revenge ;
but a conduft like this corresponded neither
with yonr principles nor views ; you fled
commodote from the enemies you vowed
vengeance upon, to American protection, and
left it only to unmalk your viperous heart,
and commence yonr trade of robbery and
plunder, and to rank yourfelf the equal of 1
pirates.

NASSAU, (N. P ) Sept. 26.
On Saturday evening, the appeanncc of the flcy
indicated the approach of a heavy gale. At it
o'clock, M. there suddenly came on a severe
squall from the southward, and for half an hour
the wind blew with very great violence. The
weather has fir.ee been moderate.
The trial of the American East Indiaraan Asia,
re-captured by the Ratigcr trivater, came on thiÂ«
day in the court of vice admiralty. The counsel
for the re-captorÂ» conunded for the whole, both
vessel and cargo, being condemned, as lawful
prize ; and in support of this claim, urged the uni
form pra&icethat has hitherto obtained, where no
flipulations were made by particular conventions or
treaties, for a fpecific falvagc in cases of recapture.
The fcntence o! the court, it iÂ« supposed, will be

LONDON, August 19.
efterday letters ot intelligence were re- 1
ceived at \he office of the secretary to the I
admiralty, Whitehall, from admiral Dun- <
can's fleet. The Brkilh and Dutch fleets it 1
seems still hold their usual situations. 1
Yesterday we received Dutch and Bruf
fell papers down to the date of the 12th j
inft. The former are extremely ban-en of i
news, every thing having been anticipated
by preceding accounts. The intelligence 1
brought by the latter is extremely impor- I
tant, inaftuuch as it may be faii to exhibit '1
the fine qua non oi the imperial cabinet, 1
whieli is said to insist on a fulfilment of the t
fbidt letter of the preliminary articles. 1
The Udme account also (Irongly inti- t
mates that the negociatioi) is drawing to a t
close. Perhaps it is not the intention of J
Buonaparte to return tp Udine, but at the
head of his army. J
The Auftrians and French, both on the t
fide of the Rhine and Italy, are making 1
movements which indicate a renewal of hoi"- 1
tilities. t
Accounts are moreovet said to have been I
received yesterday at the imperial ambaffa- c
dor's, that the emperor will certainly break
off the negociations with Buonaparte, un- f
less the idea of dividing Italy into republics 1
is totally given up; but as the cefiiou on <i

1 LONDON, August 21â22.
. Letters from Ireland, by the mail of yes
terday, state two matters not much in uni
[ son, though proceeding from the fame cause,
| an increase of difaffeftion and of quiet.
[ Neither the bayonet nor the Flames have
fufficiently discriminated. Not only the pa
[ rifli of R-. thfryland, refpe&able in extent,
4 in population, in indnftry, but almost the
entire country from Newry to Dundalk has
been dcfolated, under the suspicion of a ge
neral propensity to defenderifm ; nor has
the progress of alarm been marked by less
fatality in other quarters.
The consequence muftbe obvious, the ma
ny who will not, like the Spaniel, lick the
hand by which they are chastised, brood o
ver their illsÂ« and thirst for the moment in
which they think they may surmount them.
The laftaccounts from Lord St. Vincents
and Bridport, state the continuance of their
fleets in their former ftatiors. ,
On Saturday arrived the firft of the Ham
burgh mails due, which brought intelli
gence of rather an hostile nature, as far as
regarded the negociations between the em
peror artd the French republic. The let
ters from Vienna stated in very positive
terms, that his Imperial majefly had deter
mined to renew hostilities, rather than cede
the fortrefs of Mantua to the Cisalpine re- ;
public, which the French have founded in
Ita ly- ,
Yesterday another Hamburgh mail, and 1
also the chaplain of Sir Morton Eden, who 1
came with dispatches from Vienna. The <
advices are much more pacific than those 1
brought by the preceding mail ; and ivc 1
find, that after numerous difficulties railed '
by the French negociator in Italy, in re- {
gard to thecefiion of Mantua to the Empe- â¢
ror, the diredhiry at length inftrufted him ,
to give up the point: and accordingly, a
Mantua is to be restored to his imperial ma- 1
jefty;. but all the French ordnance and
stores are to be previously taken away. t
The principal point of difference being ;
now removed, we may expefl to hear the de- t
finitive treaty of peace has been signed be- b
'tween the emperor and the French republic; a
unless, indeed, the former chufes to wait a
the issue of the negociation at Lisle ; for t
which place, Mc. Brooks, the messenger, ftt n
off late on Saturday night, with the answer ],
of our court to the last dispatches. Lord t
Levifon Gower remains in town. f.
We learn by private letters from Ham- 0
burgh, of the 11 th inft. that the objeft of c
the King of Sweden's journey into Germa- t ;
ny, was firft to fee the king of Prussia at
Pyrmont ; but prlnciprlly to elpoufe appri- t ]
cess of the lioufe of Saxe Coburgh, whither a
his Swtdifh majesty has gone. The king p
of Prussia is returned to Berlin. t j
Mr. Higgins the messenger has been dif- ti
patched by government with advices to the Ci
hon. Robert Walpole, his majesty's ambaffa- y
dor at the court of Portugal.
Mr. Pitt came to town yesterday from ft
Holwood, and Mr. Secretary Nepean had J Â£
a long intetview with him at his house in f-
Downing street, on iuftruftions, it is said, Jv
which are to be sent to eirl St. Vincent
cruising with his fleet off Cadiz, in confe- t ]
quenee of the treaty between France and p
Portugal.
Black collars have been adopted as the ti
co(tuple of the royalists in Paris. The sol- Vl
â  ! diers have torn them off and the beaux call
e it a title of honour to be ftript of their eol
tar. One young man snot a soldier with a
pittol who attempted to pull his off. Or
it ders, however, have been given to appre
e bend every soldier who /hall attempt to in
e fulc any citieen on account of his dress.
n I he inhabitants of all the towns in
Holland, particularly those of Amsterdam,
rr are very "hoftik to the French, and endea
vour by every means in therp power, to shake
a off the French yoke. The Dutch, in all
i. their public meetings, make no hesitation in
f- expressing the strongest antipathy against
t, their invaders ; but the powerful arm of ty
i- ranny still keeps them in fubjedfcion.
A printed address, bearing the Agna
il tures of about i 50,000 perfotis was lately
circulated in eledtorate of Treves, inviting
1- the inhabitants of the left bank of the Rhine
if â¢ to'depofp their govertrbrs, and either join
le | with France, or establish themselves into an
1- independent republic. Gen. Hochc, con
y fidering this revolutionary system as being
h ioconfiitent with the preliminaries of peace,
r- in which the integrity of the Germanic em
i- â¢ pire is (iipulated, eaufed the address to be
n suppressed, and some of the principals in the
if business to be banished frinn Bonn,
ft | Though there can be little danger of any
I attempt to commence the siege of Gibraltar,
n yet such is the precaution of government'
1, that the store of fait provisions now in the
â - garrison, is said to be fufficitnt to Hip ply a
ny reasonable consumption for five years to
a come. The principal spring of Water, how.
e ever, is under the command of the Spanilh
â - batteries.
It is confidently said, that general Simcoe
n who a few days since arrived from the Weft-
Indies in the Swallow armed brig, has come
home to represent to government the abfo
t lute necessity offending â, lt to St. Domin
go a considerable military force for the fup

August 23 â24.
Dispatches from lord Malmefbury were
. this day received at the feeretarv of state's
. fr Â»m Lisle, by Mr. Wick, the mes
senger, who reached Calais in 12 hours, and
' was only 9 h Â°uÂ« in his passage to Dover ;
. when he arrived, no communication was
. permitted with the vessel. The dispatches
, were transmitted to lord Grenvilie at Drop
more. They are said to be of the firft im
portance ; but nothing particular has trans
pired.
... le ' or d Malmefbury at Lille is
likely to be of longer duration than was at
' firft txpefted ; his lordship has taken a
. house there for himfelf and his retinue.
â¢ The Hamburgh mail, due on Sunday
1 last, arrived this day.
The intelligence from Italy relates to tlis
troubles in Piedmont, and to the distresses
at Venice.
This day arrived a moil from Lifton,
brought to Falmouth by the Walfingham
Packet in II days. It is said to bring ad
vice of :he bombardment of Cadiz having
wholly ceased ; aud that rear-admirrl NeU
son has been derashed by earl St. Vincent,
with 3 fhipj of the line and 4 frigates, on
an expedition against the island of Tcneriffe.
The fleet were to call at Gibraltar fÂ«r fotpe
transports, with troops and ammunition,
to be employed in the enterprise.
Paris remains in a (late of perfeft tran
quillity, notwithstanding which the military
preparations are continued with much aÂ£li
vity. Two more regiments of cavalry are
arrived, and the Champ de Mars is filled
with cannon.. The breach between the
councils and the diredlory does not appear
to have received s complete reparation.
1 lie former naturally view the proceedings
of the latter with a jealous eye, and are
adopting every prats/cable means to abridge
'-he'r military nutherity and influence. The
council of five hundred, in the fitting of
the 17th irift. decreed that the directory
should not have power to cashier officers at
their discretion ; and that no naval or mili
tary officer should for the future be difroif
fed, except by virtue of a legal judgment.
In the fitting of the 17th, a very flattering
..atemsnt was presented to the council, of
the amount of the receipts and expenditures
of the public.money, and a committee was
appointed to report upon the abuse of the
liberty of the pj-efs.
1 he armies ft:ll continue to address tha
direSory Upon the conduft of the councils,
in language the most severe and intemperate:
to which, it is certain, they ire encouraged
by their commanders. General Hoehe has
at length thrown off the mantle of disguise
and boldly declared to his troops tlie iiiten,
tions of the dire&cry, of whom he is the
1110 ft determined partizan. Thus it is no
longer doubtful, that notwithstanding all
the equivocation of the drreSory upon the
fubjeft, it is their determination to violatp
oiiÂ« of the most effeutial principles of the
constitution which' they have sworn to main
tain, by marching the force into the
interior 01" France, without the fanftion of
the legislative bodies, fhonld they find fucfv
an expedient neceflary to answer their own
private view's and ambitious purpofe3.* By
tiiefe means they may secure a temporary *' â¢
triumph j but the viftory of force over la\v
can never be deemed honorable, nor iÂ» it
likely that its effects can be permanent.
The late strong gales of wind from the
loiuh-weft have compelled lord Bndport to
leave, for a time, bis station before Brest.
His lordship's fleet was off Falmouth on
Monday evening.
The foreign journals contain rumours of
the signing of the Definitive Treaty of
Peace .between the Ertiperor and French r< -
public. This report appears to be prema
ture ; atleaft, it is probable, that of an e
vent so important, we should, Ufore thit,W had information by the French paperi. <
Oy the lad accounts from Vienna, indeed,
t.iere is intelligence that seems to counte
nance this report. The Emperor, it is fa id
is to retain Mantua ; and to be indemnified
tor.thf lpfs of Lombardy, by Dalmatia,
and a part of the Venetian Terra Fir
ma. The rumors upon this fubjea have
yen so frequent and so contradictory that
( . they lhculd be received with caution. If it
found to be true, vs'e fliould consider it as
a fayeurable omen for the return of a gene
!" , P eace - T'}Â°rÂ»gh apparently separate, it
j w?â¢ Potable that the negociations at
L dina, and at L.ifie, have been in a confi
rfsrable degree connected ; and they may
both, therefore, be expe&ed to have a com
mon re fait: A confirmation of peace with
the Emperor, would afford ground to be
lieve, that there is a fair profpeft of a fa
vourable ifTue to lord Malmefbury's riecoci
ation. b
The report that the new Dutch Conditu
tion has been rejefted, gains ground. It 1
has already been rejeited in some places, and '
the accounts from that country agree in Ha
ting its acceptance, by the majority, as cx- I
tremely uncertain. t
Government have lately contrasted for,
and are fending off with as much expedition
as possible to the squadrons employed in the '
blockade of the enemy's ports, immense J
quantities of vegetables. A gardener, at t
â lotherhithe,. has already lent off to tht vest
ft!s at the Red House, Deptford, which are I
employed on this service, 50,000 cabbages, '
00,000 carrots, 50,000 leeks, 103,000 oui- 0
ons, and 60 tons of potatoes, which are r ,

We are bappy to announce the fafe ar- u
r ' va l of the Leeward island fleet, in the el
Downs, at Bridol, and the other ports to
which they were dedined. r '
We received lad night a regular ft ries of
the Paris papers up to Wednesday last. The ni
mod material article of intelligence brought pi
by this conveyance, is a letter from the re
commander in chief of a battalion of Berna-
divifion, upon the fubjeft of the trea
ty titween the emperor and the French re
public, which announces the ratification of
the conditions of peace, by his imperial ma- d;
jefty, 011 the 30th ult. This letter is dated
Udina, the feat of negociation, July 31ft, m
and the following is a literal translation of in
't : ta
" May my letter announce to you fuffi- pt
ciently soon the happy news which I have cl
just learned. A courier that arrived last â to
night from Vienna, dispatched by the mar- is
quis di Gallo, announces that the emperor P<
has ratified the conditions of peace, such as ur
they were presented to him. All the world ta
rejoices. I hasten to close my letter, that so
it may reach you sooner."
Notwithstanding the tirft impression made, 1
on the authority of this intelligence, vague D
and nor.-official as it certainly is, on a more tic
attentive perusal of these papers, we do not ed
fee reiifon to give implicit credit to this re- J th
I port. If the definitive treaty of peace had in

d The negociation at Lisle goes on in the
:, mofl languid manner. England is obstinate
if in retaining all the possession* which die had I
taken front Holland, and France, on her part I
i- pretends that she is bound by the treaty con- J
e ( eluded with that Republic, to hive restored
I.to it all that it has loft during the war. It I
- is remarkable, that at the moment when I
r Peace is mod neceflary to France, they vol
s untarily deprive themselves of all its advan

Extraa of a letter from Cape Francois, dated
Oftober i, 1797.
" I wrote you the 21ft ult. Since this 0<
period I have nothing new to communicate,
rave the arrival at Port de Park of the two
, French frigates from America. ' They were
closely pursued k off this island, and were
very near being captured, ' Â«.
'â¢ The com million still continue to con- J
demft our veflels bound to Englilh ports ; 0i
and the privateers and gun-boats take every
thing they fall ill' with. Veflels captured
bound to French ports are set at liberty,
but the administration take their cargoes,
and consequently ruin their voyages."
