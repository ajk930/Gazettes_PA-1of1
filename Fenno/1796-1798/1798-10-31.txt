FROM LATE LOXDO .V PA P E R\S
i SICKNESS AND MORTALITY
>
IV
NAVIES AND ARMIES.
FROM the year 1742 to 174.8, during
the war i ; ; FlanderS, 32,246 sick were ad
mitted into the hospitals, of which 3,563
died, or in the proportion of one in nine.
Admiral Holler's squadron were fofiekly
in the Welt Indies, that not one man in fifty
returned to Europe.
Lord Anfon in his voyage round the
world, in lefe than two years, loft by sickness
. four-fifths of his mm, and in the aftion with
the Acapulcov he had hardly men enough to
work his guns. He returned to England
with only one ftlip out of all his squadron,
and that not one third manned.
The navy and army, employed at Car
| thagena, mouldered away to nothing.
During the last German war, from July
1758, to January, 1763, the vfhole number
of men sent from England to the Continent,
iinliijmg-1 in uilspiniamitcd
of whom 14,256 wsre at different timers
sick ; and of that number 6,500 died, or
in the proportion nearly one half. Those
who were killed in the battle, or died of
tfteir wounds, are not included in the above ;
they amounted' to 1,300.
In 1757, the Fronch fleet which had sa
ved Louilbiirg, returned to Brest, and land
ed 4000 sick ; the fever which raged a
mongst thpm wasfoon communicated to the
attendants in the hospitals, and from them to
the inhabitants of the towo and its env rafts,
so that in left than fiÂ»Â£ months, between ten
and twelve thousand perished.
The expedition to the Havanna was near
ry rendered abortive by sickness. Near three
fourths of the army perilhed by fever and
dysentery.
Durintr the late war, wKc:i the combined
fleets of France and Spain made a bravado
Â«f anckoiing in Torbay, the remitting fever

â¢ALEXANDRIA.
* Alexandtia, built by Alexander the
Great, from whence it had it 3 name, vied
almofl in magnificence with the ?."cient ei
tics of Egypt. It lla ds foi',- days jjuri'cy
from Cairo, and was formerly the chief
nart of all the Lafterfi trade. Ibe merchan
dises were unloaded st f Poring Muris, a
town on the-Weftern coalt cf the Red Sea;
from whence they wrre hrcnght upop ca-
Biels to a town of Thebais, called 1
and conveyed down the Nile to Alexandria,
whither merchants reforted'from all parts. 1
It is well known, that the Eali India 1
trade has at a<l times enriched those who car
ried it on. I hig was th.it chief fountain of '
the v?ll treasures, that Solomon amalfed, 1
and whicu enabled him to Luild the magni- 1
ficent temple of Jerpfalem. David, by his 1
conquering Idurr-a, became master of Ele- '
ath and Efiiorgrber, two towns fit Hated on '
the ealhh store cf the R s d Sea. From j 1
these two sports, Solomon sent flscts to O-'j
I phir and farlhilh, which alwayi brought
S back imrrthfe richtp.;t The traffic after
having been employed some time by the Sy
rians, wl)o'regained Idumaca, IhifteJ from
them to the Tyrians. These got all their j
merchandize conveyed bv the way of Rhi
nocolura, (a great sea-port town lying,
bet wen the confines of Egypt and Pa- 1
Â£ It [line) to Tyre, from wberÂ«e they dil-!
ributcd them all over the Weflern world.
3 Hereby the Tyrians enriched themselves ex
ceedingly, under the Perfiau Empire ; by
y the favor and prote&ion of whose
y they had the full poffeflion of this trade.
But when the Ptolomies had made tliera
re selves tnaftjers of Egypt, they soon drew all
l!> this trade into theif kingdom, by building
11 Berenice and other ports on the western fide ;
'* of the Red Sea belonging to Egypt, and
fixed their chief mart at Alexandria, which 1
'Â» thereby rcfe to be the city of the greatest
trade its the world. There it continued for 1
r " a great many ( centuries after, and all the <
traffic which the wetlern parts of the worl,d >
y from that time had with Persia, India, Ara-1
r bia and the taflÂ«rn coasts of Africa, was
wholly carried on through the Rtd Sea, and
J the mouth of the Nile, till a way was dif
-5 covered, of failing to those parts, by the
r Cape of Good Hope. After this the Por- j
t r tnguefe for fomÂ« time managed this trade ; 1
ir but now it is in a manner engrossed wholly (
: by the Englifli and Dutch. This ihort ac- 1
count of the East India trade, from Solo- ,
'* mon k s time to the present age, is extraded 1
from Dr. I'rideaux,
For the convenience of trade, there was ! ;

9 Pharos J*"a tower which bore the fame name, j ,
At the top of this tower there was kept a i
1 fi'C, to light such (hips as failed by night ,
near those dangerous coasts, which were full I t
of sands and Ihelves, from whence all other I (
towers designed for the fame use have been I c
called, as Pharo di Messina, &c. The fa- I f

Ptolemy Philadelphia, who expended eight t

plain according to the manner of the an

1 Princes are very fond of, to fuffer p
that his name ftiould not be so much as men- p
