Friday, April 13.
THE K'fc R laid before the HouTe a
report of the Secretary of the Treafufy,
on a'memorial of sundry merchants ot this
city, praying for the erection of certain piers
in the river Delaware. The report (Kites it
to be the opinion of the Secretary of theTrea
fiiry, that it will be expedient to provide for
the erection of tlie said piers, and recommends
an appropriafion of a fttm of money for the
purpose.âCommitted for Monday.
Mr. Craik, from the committee to whom
was referred the amendments of the Senate to
the bill providing an appropriation for com,
â  leting the necessary buildings in the city of
Wafhingten, reported it as their opinion, that
the amendments ought to be agreed to. The
report was committed to a committee of the
whole, -and being made the order for this day
the House resolved itfelf into a committee of
the whale on that futojeCl. The Senate had
(truck out all the bill, except the enabling
clatife, and inserted in its place a provision
for a loan of 100,000 dollars, which, together
with the 100,000 dollars which has already
Keen obtained 011 Join under the authority of
the law in which Congress guarantees a loan
for the city of Washington, mak<* up the
300,000 dollars there authorized to be bor
rowed. The original bill, as sent from this
House, proposed a grarit of 200,000 dollars ;
but the Chairman of the feteiit committee
(Mr. Craik) said, as he believed this was all
that couid be got at this time, he hoped the
amendment would be agreed to. It was a
greed to accordingly.
Mr. Varnum presented a petition from the
freeholders and others of the town of Cam
bridge, in the date of Maffachufetis, Itating
their alarm on account of the privilege given
to merchants to arm their vefl'els (whicb they
look upon as tantamount to war) as they be
lieve rfronger reasons than ever now exilt for
redraining their arming; that they anxiously
wilfi for peace, believing that we have no
thing to hope from war, but dishonour and
disgrace; that they hope no idea of falfe ho-
prevent such measures being taken
as (hall preserve peace, and by that means
mod certainly promote the public welfare.
Mr. Varnum moved that this petition be
referred to the committee of the whole 011 the
state of the Union.
- Mr. Dana said he did not hear the petition
didinCtly, but he thought there were lome
things in it which were not very proper to be
contained in a petition, and which rendered it
improper to be referred.
The quedioh was put, and it was referred,
38 '0 35-
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
Claims, made a report on the petition of the
Hot*. Henry Glen. The report dates that
during the principal part of the lad war, Mr."
Glen discharged the duties of an Agent in the
Commiftary General's and Quarter Mailer
General's departments, as will as an Agent
of Indian Affairs, in an highly meritorious
manner; that lie received pay only in one ca
pacity till the 10th May, 1782, though he
fervr.d in (evcral; that he ferveo.as Agent for
Indian Affairs two years .afterwards, for
which he exported to have received pay from
General Schuyler, who was one of the Com
mi(T?orters for Indian Affairs. Being difap
peinied in that expectation, he was told he
nu ;"sciv to the tTnited States for compen
fjtiQH. On applying to tsie Treasury, the
officer , refufed to fettle his accounts, being
barred by the Itatutes of limitation. Mr.
Glen prays for at lead his two years pay is
Agent of l.idian Affairs. The committee re
gret that these accounts were not presented ini
proper time, but cannot find reasons for sus
pending the aft of limitation in this cafe,
which would not apply in many others; they
therefore recommend that the petitioner have
leave to withdraw his petition.
Mr. Livingston presented the petition
of Charles White, of this city, merchant,
praying that means may be taken forreftoring
to him his vefl'el, which has been seized, 011
account of improper conduct in the captain
employed.âReferred to the committee of
commerce and manufactures.
Mr. Bayard, from the Managers of the
Impeachment agaicift William Blount, who
were appointed to confer with the Senate on
the subject of their resolution, made a report
which was orderad to lie on the table.
Mr. SiWALL moved that the committee of
the whole to whom was referred the bill from
the Sentate to authorize the Prcfident to pur
chase one or more foundries, be discharged
from the further confederation of it, and that
it be referred to the committee of the whole
on the (late of the Union ; which being car
ried, he then moved that the House go into a
committee of the whole on the date of the
Union, which was done accordingly, and the
committee proceeded to consider the resoluti
on which was yederday under discussion, for
appropriating a sum of money for the purchase
of cannon, arms, and ammunition, and the
amendment proposed by Mr. Sewall, to em
power the President, in cafe other means
Oieuld fail in any considerable degree, to pur
chase or hire foundries or armouries, which
(hall be employed in manufacturing the fame
for the use of the United States.
This amendment was supported by Mcffrs.
Sewall, Brooks, Otis, Dana, Gordon, Harper,
Dayton, J. Williams, Rutlcdge, Allen, Hart
ley, and Pinckney, on the ground of its be
ing necessary to provide for a (upply of can
non and arms at all events; that though they
allowed it would be bed to purchase whillt
that colild be done, yet there being but few
places in the United Stateswhere cannon of a
large callibre in particular could be calt, the
pr6prietors of these Aorks might unite toge
ther and refufe to contrail for a supply of
cannon, except upon very exorbitant terms ;
or it was possible they might be influenced by
a foreign country not to furnifh a supply, and
if such (hould be the cafe, an appropriation of
money could not procure cannon, and it would
be proper and necessary, that tne President
should have a power to hire or purchase foun
dries, ami to employ persons to work them
bn our own account.
It was opposed by Meflrs. Livingdon, Gal
latin, Maton, Nicholas, M'Dowell, Lyon and
T. Claiborne, from a conviction that cannon
could be purchased to any extent; that if this
power was given they doubted not the project
of calling our own cannon would be immedi
ately gone into, which, from pad experience,
they had every reason to believe would be ex
penflve beyond measure, without answering
any good purpose; and so far from fecurirg
a supply, they thought it would be likely to
prevent it, as when the founders fee the Pre
lident has a power to purchase, they may re
fufe to contract, from Hie hope of making a
good bargain in the fate of their works.
The tjuellion on the amendment was put
and carried, there being $0 votes in favour of
it-
The resolution was then carried without a
division; the committer rose, and a bill was
v rd*red to be brought in accordingly^
On a motion of Mr. Liying(t"on, theHoii
relo'ved itfelf into a committee of rtie whole
on the report of the committee ot commerce
and manufactures on the petition of Pierre
Aupoix, who prays for a drawback on goods
exported, which was refufed to be paid him
by the collector of New York, on the ground
of h ; i having omitted to take the oath (during
the time of a firmer collector) not to re-land
the goods in the United States, though he had
complied with every other reqailite, and it
was an omission of thecolleflor that he did'
npt do this. The report was favourable, and
was concurred in, after some debate. The
committee rose, and the House having con
firmed the decision, a bill vjras directed to be
brought in accordingly. Adj. till Monday.

and secure and defend our territory and sove

Hon. Samuel Sewall,!
Chairman, See. See. J
War Department, 9th April, 1798.
WHAT measures are Jiecedary and pro
per to be adopted by Congress, in the
present conjuncture, to preserve character a
broad, elteem for the government at home,
fafety to our sea-property, and protection to
our territory and sovereignty !
France derives several important advanta
ges from the fydem (he is pursuing towards
the United States. Besides the tweets of
plunder, obtained by her privateers, die keeps
111 them, a nursery of (eamen, to be drawn
upon, in all.conjunctures, by her navy. She
unfits, by the fame means, the United States
for energetic measures, and thereby prepares
11s, for the lad degree of humiliation and fub
jeCtion.
To forbear under such circumdances, from
taking naval and military meafures,to secure
our trade, defend our territory in cafe of in
valion, and prevent or suppress domedic in
surreCtion, would be, to offer up the United
States a certain prey to France, and exhibit to
the world a fad fpeflacje of national degrada
tion and imbecility.
The United States pod'efsan extensive trade,
heavy expences mud be submitted to for its
protection The United States border upon
the provinces of great and powerful king
doms, heavy expences mud bo incurred, that
we may be at all times in a situation to assert
our rights to our own territory. The measures
which appear iridifpenfibly necedary for Con
gress to take, are as follows, viz.
id. An increaSe ot the naval force, to serve
as convoys, proteCt our fiflieries, coad and
harbours. 2d. An augmentation of the pre
sent military edablidiment. 3d. Arrange
ments which in cafe of emergency, will give
to the President, the prompt command of a
further and'efficacious military force, 4th.
The more complete defence of our principal
ports by fortifications. sth. A supply of
ordnance, small arms, powdei, falt-petre,
copper and military storesâ 6th. Additional
revenue.
To answer the id. Congress ought to pro
vide for the building or purchasing, equip
ping, &c.-of 2 vessels of 22 guns, Bos 20 guns,
and ten of 16 guns, in addition to the three
frigates.
Congress might also to ved the President
with authority, in cafe of open rupture, to
provide, equip, and by such means as he may
judge bed, a number or (hips of the line, not
exceeding fix, or an equivalent force in sri
gates.
The firft may be either built or purchased
in the United States. The latter may, per
haps) be obtained in Europe ; for which pur
pose the law (hould use general dXpreffions,
admitting this mode of procuring them.
To build the twenty vessels, equip, man,
and provifionthem for twelve months, will re
quire, as per edimate, dolls. 1,941,181
It may, under, under this head, be also ad
visable, to make a provision for (ix gallies,
carrying each one or two 24 pounders. This
will require for galliescarrying one 24 pound
er as per edimate, dolls. 68,826
id. An augmentation of the present milita
ry edablidiment. This ought to confid of offe
regiment of infantryâl regiment of artillery,
and 1 regiment of cavalry. The artillery is
considered as indifpenfible, and the cavalry
may be highly ufeful in the southern dates.
These will require, agreeably to the edimate,
g dolls. 517,998
3. An arrangement which in cafe of emer
gency, will give to the President, the prompt
command of a further and efficacious milita
ry force.
This ought to be, a provisional army of
20,000 men, and may be organized agreeable
to the principles of a bill proposed in the Se
nate during the late extraordinary session, to
which I beg leave to refer.
4. The more complete defence of our prin
cipal ports by fortifications.
This may require, 100,0000 of dollars, but
(hould the naval force be rendered respeCta
ble, much of this sum may be (aved.
5. A supply of cannon, small arms, fait pe
tre, copper, 6cc. which, severally, will re
quireâ
For cannon, as per edimate, dolls. 308,900
For small arms, fay 50,000 dands, at
12 dolls. 600,000
For fait petre, copper for
(heathing, Sec. 200,000
In framing the law, to furnifh our maga
zines with ordnanfe, it will be proper to em
ploy such expreflions, as will enable the Pre
sident to procure brass cannon, mortars, &c.
with the neceirary quantities of ball, (hells,
&c. These have not been fpecified in the
edimate ; but thefum may, perhaps, be Ulffi
cient to comprehend them.
To render the regiment of infantry as ufeful
as possible, it is proposed, that the men (hould
be inlided to aCt in the double capacity of
marines and infantry. By an arrangement of
this kind, and having the men dationedat the
principal sea ports, they will be always ready
to be put on board such vessels as want them,
and when not so wanted, will serve to defend
the coad, work upon the fortifications, or in
dock yards, and guard the public property
from thefts or embezzlement.
All which is refpeCtfully fubmitfed.

RASTADT, February 2.
The answer of the Deputation of the em
pire was yesterday transmitted to the French j
Minister : it >ftates,
1. That they had expected, from the jus
tice and magnanimity of the French govern
ment, that they would have proposed, as the
basis of the treaty, the (tipulations, in favour
of the empire, which were made in the preli
minaries signed at Leobon. 2. That by these
preliminaries an armistice had been stipulated
till the period of a' definitive peace, and they
had reaibn to expert that all boftilities were
toceafeyand that all contributions and requi
(itions were to be discontinued. 3. That in
the Territories of the Empire occupied by the
French troops, property (till continued to be
seized and sequestrated, under pretence of e
migration, although the laws of nations for
bid the application of French laws to the cases
of the individuals concerned, and that they
have reason to expect, from the justice of the
French govenment, that these oppressions
would be prohibited. 4 That they (hould
likewise wifb that the French government
would disavow the projefts of republicanizing
and changing the forms of government in
certain (tates of the eTnpire occupied, or not
occupied, by the French troops.
The following is the answer of the French
Ministers to the note of the deputation of the
Empire, in which they declared that they
could not agree to the ceflion of the left Bank
of the Rhine, and that the indemnification
proposed for tfie powers, who have poffeflions
on the left Bank of ;he Rhine, at the expence
of those on the right, and the fijcularizations
of the Electorates or Biihoprics, is impracti
cable. It concludes with entreating the
French Ministers to propose more reasonable
bases.
Answer of the French Ministers.
" THE undersigned have received the an
swer of the Deputation of the Empire to the
proposal for the Rhine as the boundaries of
the French Republic. In transmitting it to
their government, they cannot help observing
that it rests upon foundations essentially vici
ous. All Europe knows that the Empirede
clared waragainfl the Republic at a time when
tbe latter entertained the mod sincere desire
and had the mod powerful interest in main
taining peace. It is futile then here to reft 011
the declaration, that the Republic would un
dertakeSvar for the purpose of conquest and
aggrandizement; a declaration besides which
in no refpeft excludes legitimate indemnifi
cation, especially in the cafe of unjust aggres
sion, and which in no refpeft alters the right
of providing for its security, by the establish
ment of fixed boundaries. It is evident,'on
the other, hand, that the constitution of the
Empire will not be altered by the single eir-
Cumftance of the diminution of its territory.
In fine, the preliminaries of a treaty in which
the Germanic , Empire is not even a party,
Ciinmjt be made the foundation of objection,
especially when its provisions are superseded
by thbfe of a definitive peace, ftibfequently
concluded. It is upon these three bases,
however, that the whole answer of the depu
tation re (Is.
The nvoment their vicioufnefs is demon- .
Urated, therefult is overthrown- The mo
tives which juftify the demand of the French
Republic remain in full force. The indem
nity claimed by the Republic is lawful. Its
security requiresthe boundaries of the Rhine.
The tranquility of the Empire even more
forcibly will demand these limits. The de
putation of the empire has been compelled
formally to admit that the' Republic would
not acquire a considerable acquisition of tbe
Trans Rihane either inrefpeCtof
their extent, their language, their customs,
and their mode of thinking. From this ob
servation it indisputably follows, that it is not
from a desire of, aggrandizement that the
French Republic desires the boundary of the
Rhine, and that its demand rests upon a basis
much more forcible, upon a motive common
to the two powers, that of providing by inva
riable boundaries for their future tranquility.
Such is the objecft at present to be fettled, and
not that series of questions which the deputation of

To this the Deputation returned an answer, in'
which they ascribed the war to the aggrefDons of
the French, and hope the Dire<2ory will fee the
importance of their objections.
February 4,
Count Gortz yesterday received a ccurier from
Berlin, who set out from that city a few hours af
ter the arrival of a courier from Peter/burg. It is
said thjit several of the princes of the .Empire have
made a representation of the present situation of
Germany to the Emperor of Rullia, and earnestly
implored his aid and afliftance.
The French ministers have returned an answer
to the representation of the Austrian Plenipoten
tiarirs,in whichthelattcrcomplaincdof theprogref j
oftfle system ofTcvolution in the Btffgw, Uppar

February 4.
In the fitting <rf the deputation of the Empire on
the 6th, the note of the French jninifters-of the xd
of February, was taken into farther consideration.
After mature delibÂ«ration of the contents, it waÂ»
resolved to return an answer to the sol owing pur
port, which has already been delivered.
In this answer it was represented to the French
ministers, that " the negotiations for peace- could
he forwarded by nothing more than by enabling
the deputation to perceive at once, and in a ncr
fe<Stly connected manner, what the French Repub
lic required of the German Empire as a-facrifice, at
the termination of thi~ unfort.natr war, and what
it meant to propnfe as the conditions of peace.
Should an equitabfe and fatisfa<Story propofltion bÂ«
made on the par.of the Republic, the
| would thereby be enabled to answer in such a man-
J ner as must afford .the heft founded hope of ar
1 speedy conclusion of the negociStion. On Ms ao
I count,- an answer, relative to the acceptance of the
| conditions proposed as the basis of peace, has not
'' yet been returned In the mean time, it will be
' considered as the firft proof of tlie peaceable difpo
; litions of the French Republic, {hould it withdraw
i its troops from the right bank of the Rhine, and
; relieve tho countries which have fuflired so se
verely.
The answer which the French ministers fhail re
turn to this note, will be of confiderahle inipor"
tance with refpeift to the progr,cfs of the negociation-
The Austrian plenipotentiaries have declared that
they have no inftruAions relative t!o the question of
tlie imundar V of the Rhine. It is said, however,
that this demand of the French ministers were not
expected at Vienna.

PHILADELPHIA,
FRIDAY EVENING, April 20.
Yesterday the House ot Representatives of
the United States, went info a committee of
the whole on the State of the Union, on the
bill to provide an additional-armament for the
further protection of the trade of the United
States, and tor other purposes ; when the mo
tion to strike out the fourth Section coming a
gain finder conlidet'ation, it was (truck out al
nioll by common consent. The fifth, sixth
and seventh Sections, all which related to the
employment of the velTels as convoys, were
also (truck out âone part of the House not
thinking it necefl'ary to (tireft the Pi'elident
how the velTels should be employed, and a-
Bother being against their being employed as
convoys altogether. A motion was then
made by Mr. S. Smith, and carried 49 to 17,
for (triking out Sixteen velTels and inserting
twelve. Mr. Gallatin then madeamotion
to amend the firft Section, by adding the fol
lowing wools, " provided they velfsls)
lhall not, in time of peace, be employed as
convoys to any foreign.ptfrt or place," which
he Supported by a Speech ot considerable
length. The committee rose without taking
a qjie'ftiitn.
The thip India Packet, is arrived at Boston
from Canton.

For a few days aft-r the President's 111

The rulers of France, unrestrained by a
ny coqPderation of morality or religion. â
Under the hypocritical pretence ofeitablilh
ing liberty and equality, have by plunder,
a'Safiination and murder, a military
despotism, furpjffing in enovmous atrocity,
infinitely, all preceding tyrannies. This ef
fect, a dreadful lcffon to mankind, is not,
perhaps, to be deplored, as it respects the
wretched victims now groaning under the
cruel lafti, who were the willing inflruments
of fabricating this engine of torture-. This,
it might rcafoDaWly have been hoped, would
have deterred, every American mind, from
widiing a fraternal union,, with such a de
testable monster. But this is not, all-
France haa carried deftru.'".ion and ruin to
every country to which (he extend
dtlulion ; and exUnfive, indeed, has been
th s delusion. Holland, Venice, Genoa,
Geneva, wfiat alas have ye got in exchange
for liberty, fafety and independence,
but muider, pillage, sacrilege, and a
Source of desolation, furpaffmg all these,
Bioicrn pliilofophy, or in other, words
othrifm ? Ar.d Switzerland, too, for
centuries the abode rf peace, happiness,
virtue and religionâSwitzerland tlk pride
and tlie boast of ths friends of republican -
ism, is, from the Same ca*Se; -ufhing to ru
in. With all theSe things palling before us,
the leaders of a faftion have dared to infnlt
our understanding and our virtue, by propo
fitig the French revolution as a model for i
mitation, and urging a cloSe union with its
authors.
One half of the deformities of this pic
ture are not yet exhibited. From the com
mencement of their revolution, the French
have praftiSed againlt us a catalogue as un
pardonable crimes. They have endeavour
ed to seduce us into warâthey have charged
us with the base crime of national ingrati
tudeâthey have, with diabolical malignity
Qandered thoSediftinguifhedcharaiters which
are the glory of our country âthey have ob
tained our property under solemn promises
of payment, and when they, becoming bank
rupts in credit, ate no longer able to pro
cure it by thoSe means, tvith the impudence
of lawless robbers, they it without the j
pretence of right ; nay more, against the I
solemn dipulations of national ,contradl ; j
and inflead of apologizing for those outra- i
ges, they refufe to hear our complaints ; re- ;
turn Ihidied Scorn for our remonflrances,
and treat with contempt the honourable
meffeugers of peaceand conciliation. They
do moreâthey demand our money as a fa
tisfa&ion for their plunder, and the wages of
iniquity as the price of friendjhip. And to
conclude the climax of impudence they tell
us that resistance is not in our power. That j
we are diyided, and that theyhave the means
and the " (kill" to prevent our making one
getierous effort for independence. Shall we
verify their arrogant predictions ?
The firft to eâhibit their {kill i 3
displayed by their creature Bache.. He has
undertaken to prove that Talleyrand, the
French minifler of Foreign Affairs was not
authorized by his government, to make the
corrupt proposals which he did make to our
tuiniders. Let thisfor a moment be admit
ted ; and what, then, is the inference to be
drawn ? Surely he wilhes to infer that to ev
ery thing else we are tamely to fubmitâ
that all things else are to go for nothingâ
where then is national pride, where a regard
for national interests ? Are we when un
justly chaftifcd patiently to endure, and thus
to provoke further aggreflions ? Shall we
thus dadardly Surrender our national inde
pendence, the honour of our country, and
the intereds and property of our citizens ?
Shall we without one manly effort permit
the American name, lately the moil fair
and honoured on earth, to be vilely tarnish
ed ? Forbid it gracious Heaves.
But is there no evidence that Talleyrand
afited by the direction of his government ?
Permit me to alk, whether it be poflible to
suppose that he would thus have put his
fame, his property, his life in the pow
er of our ministers ? For if unauthorised his
ruin must have been the .inevitable conft
qience of a disclosure. Again, when Mr.
Jay was sent to England, had a similar pro
portion been made by lord Grenville, would
a man in America have bad the fliamelefs
effrontery to make such a quibbling excufa"?
If any wretch had done it, he would have
been viewed witliab'horrence and detestation.
I may hereafter offer you fomefurther ob
servations on this fubjeft. In the mean time
let me warn the desperadoes of faftlon at
least to temper their temerity, and not to
trust, too much, to theunexampled patience
of the American character. Vengeance will
not always sleep. Our evils'all result from
treason, and traitors cannot always be fafe..
Our country wbuld now have been wholly
unaffailcd by the French, h:d they not
been induced by th e outrageous conduct of
the opposition. This eppofition, therefore,
is reSponsible to God and their country
for all the evils we have or may yet expe
rience. Â» A. Z. Â«
MR. FENNO,
For want of better employment, I have
teen dipping into that Farrago ofCallender,
which he dignifies with the title of Sketch
es of the History of America. Like his
" Political Progress" it may be faiJ to con
tain, " the mod allonilhing concentration
of abuse" against the administration of this
country, that is any where to be met with ;
and cannot fail to give a very advantageous
idea of the bonelly and modest merit of the
author. But however the work may be re
lished by its Supporters, for myfelf I must
fay, thflt I met with nothing like truth in
it, until I had waded into the fubjeÂ£t of
Banks, and the pernicious efftdts of the ex
cess of Bank paper. Here indeed he devi
ates into some just observations, but even
then, it is with a wicked intention. With
i milchievous design,- of throwing the blame
on the Sederalids, when it more justly be
longs to the opposite party. With reSpedt
to the ellablifhment of the Bank of the U
nited States, as an abftraft proposition, I
should fay I disapproved of it ; though the
evil of an exceSs of circulating medium, was
then little felt. But when viewed as an aid
to the Federal Government, which was,
and (till is assailed by a formidable opposition,
I pronounce it a wife and salutary measure.
Not so, with refped to the Bank as Penn
sylvania. If flic country was really fuffer
ing, as I btlieve it was, from a Superabun
dance of paper currency, the inllitution of
the latter vastly more mischievous than
that of the forme-. The evil (if existing)
was at this time more apparent, and much
encr'eafed by similar cftablilhments in differ
ent parts of the union ; and the state of
Pennsylvania was without the plea of need
i g (upport j u left indeed the anti-federal
promoters of the f heme, thought it want
ed support against the general government,
or rather the means of flopping its wheels.â
And this in fad, I have always considered
as the real ground of the eftabli(hment. Citi
zens Gallatin and Swanwick, if I miftakc
not, weTe the principal agents in the busi
ness, so it is but just, that they should have
its odium. The historian indeed helps them
out, at the expence of their sagacity.
" They did not forefce it 3 conftqucnces to
the public at large." But then he makes
t!>Â«m ample amends by observing, that "its
operations tended to weaken the vortex of
influence, which ten milb'ons of capital gave
to tbc Bank of the United States
The impartial historian fpon after betrays
a tcfil ignorance of the conduft and cbm
pofition of his party, when he so feelingly
complains of the opprcflive superiority of
the Ameactfn landed intercft. Simply to
judge from tne clanv.r of the patiiots, a
gainst the excise, and eÂ»ery species of indi
rect taxation, there appears to be some I
ground for the inference, upon the fuppo- â 
fition that they want any taxes at all. But j
to a land tax (on honed motives) they are e- j
qually opposed. As being mare generally j
felt, and therefore more likely to excite dif- j
afFeÂ£lion. to the government they prefer it, ;
and their clumsy advocate has altogether '
mifcanceived their msaning. Had he pof
fefled but a common share of difcerutneiTt,
he might have known better Far shame, ;
you historical fltetcher ! Do you not per- I
ceive that citizen Giles iÂ»- ycleped Farmer j
Giles, by way of eminence ? And that all j
his patriotic colleagues are Farmers ? Are 1
not the Republican members of the Pennfyl- â¢
vania delegation, Farmers to a man ? Hon
ed Farmers, words Â»-ternally coupled toge
ther in this country, forming a complex idea
inseparable as Hercules and his (liirt, and as
much one and indivisible, as the immaculate
and all subduing rep'ublic. For eonfufion's â¢
fake, take better heed, or your empl yers
will discard you- It is true I believe, that
in Scotland, and moltothc* landed countries,
the landed intered forms the aridocracy, but
here, at lead in Pennfylvauis, the rtmor
PatriÂ® leads them to disorganize. Yes,
through the effervefcence of patriotism, to
disorganize. Therefore look td't.
But though thehidorianhasmade atripor
two, it mud be allowed, that in general, he
is Itriftly au Pas, and preserves the bold
and manly features of the jacobin ifchool.
Morality and judice never enter into his
plans of policy. Expediency with him, is j
all in all, and though he sometimes bears us J
down with the unqueflionabl: superiority of
republican virtue, yet I believe it will be
foNnd, that he rerts his argument for French
fraternity, principally" on the idea of their
power. In the fame spirit of jacobin ener
gy, he laughs at the puny policy of bribing
the Indians into peace and good neighbor
hood. No fays he, in the true dile |of a
Carrier, offer a reward for their scalps, and
the work of extermination is quickly and
eheaplyatchieved. To Noyades and repub
lican marriages, the transition is easy, the
Delaware is as convenient as the Loire for
the purpose, and a Caledonian Executioner
as good as a French one.
It is highly probable, that this expatriat
ed Scot, this fugitive from the pillory, " if
better he belong not to the" gibbet, has
fixed hi 3 residence in Pennfylva.nia from a
very natural predileÂ£tion, for the mildness
of her penal code. But let the miscreant
reflett, that if war is really approaching,
" if Jourdan flmuld disembark from New-
Cadle," which he supposes in a dile of ex
ultation, .let him,refle6t, that the condudt of
traitors will then be closely fcrutinjzed.â
That in this cafe, his worthless carcase may
be dedined to swell the m'eafure of Federal
despotism, as that government has not yet
evinced its philanthropy, by the abolition
of the gallows.
Is it not mondrous that such infamous re
vilers (hould meet with' encouragement ? I
anticipate the reply. Have you not your
Porcupine ? I entreat the pardon of a vir
tuous man, for one moment contrading him
with such a knave. I fay a virtuous man,
as no other could discover that noble indig
nation at vice that glows through all his pro
ductions. That he lashes with leverity, mult
be granted, and that he sometimes makes
freer, with cant of Republicanism, than
a partiality for that system may approve ;
yet his censures breathe the honed warmth
of a fatirid, inllend cf the base and ranco
rons malignity of an unprincipled calumina
tor. Gentlemen from an elevated fitnation,
may hurl Billingsgate at their inferiors, and
evince their fans culottifm by the elegance
of their invedtives, they may call rogue and
lcoundrel, and because. they are malignant,
may fancy they are severe.âBut candid
men will so far avail themselves of the bleflT
ing of equality, as calmly to enquire, whe
ther the flaming patriot in Congtefs, or the
dtfpifed British fubjeft has the jufter claim
to the opprobrious appellation.
If this Callender may be supposed to
speak the sentiments of the faction, they
are now rejdicing in the profpeft of the dif
ficulties, if not of the subjugation, of their
country. For this wretch has the effronte
ry to fay with an air of fatisfadtion, that
" Mr. Adams may yet hear of a speech from
Barras that (hall make both him and Con
gress tremble."
Could a spark of generality be looked for
in minds which seem bert on felf degrada
tion, one might be tempted to set before
them the example of lord Chatham. While
measures were carrying on againd the colo
nies, that nobleman, it is well known, was
one of their mod flrenuoti3 advocates. He
even went so far as to. fay that " he rejoiced
that America had resided," and yet when
indedendence was declared, he immediately
gave up his opposition, and joined the minis
try in their â¢> eafures for reducing her to
ftlbmiflion. However unpalatable this might
have been to the Americans, they could not
but refpeft the patriotism of this illudrious '
ttatefman.
But this is a flight far above the wing !
that has been deeped in the'debafing filth of
jacobinism. In that fink of corruption
from whence have ifiued crimes, compared
with whicG tbeeuormitics of patt ages fink
into mere peccadillos, and but for which,
we could have had no idea of the hcjlifh de
pravity of our nature.
But Mr. Adams will riot retire from office,
ye ghattly grir.ners 3t the triumphant viliainy
of the day! Nor werÂ« it in his power,
would he retradt his deps, to place them in ,
your imagined fafer path of bafentfs and
proftitutioa. He will proceed as,he has be- !
gun, and he will be supported tso, by :iH
that defertfe the name tlf American*. By
those who know how toelliinjte the Ulelfings.
' of trtÂ»e liberty; and good government, and
who unsubdued by the alarming success of
vice and impiety, Hill place their reliance on
a final deftribHtion of eternal jiflh'ce. By
those, who wo<iid rather perilh in a good
cause, than triumph in a bad one ; and who
in a choice of ho.-or or infamy, disdain to
ask,

planted before the capitol, and in several of the

people, bearing the colours o! the Roman repub

The procession iffterwards motfed onward

man Republiss the tour of the
place, and passed agairt through the city tor
return to camp, accompanied every where
with cries ef joy and gratitude. In fine,
the revolution is effedtea in Rome. The al
tars of liberty have been raised in the capi

PARIS, March 2.
The aera so long looked for and whick
has for ages been the fubjeft of the prayers
of all Protestants, has at last arrivedâ(he!
deftruftion of the Papal tyranny âan event
that will be followed by the fall of all fimi'ar
ufurpgtions over the consciences of men*
wherever they may be found.âThe arrival
of the French troops at Rome has been
fignalizedby the overthrow of the feeble
Government of the Pope, and the establish
ment of a Republic Fire Confids have
been appointed as the Executive Power,
and the other members of the Provisional
Gevernment have been installed in the Papal
Palace.âPerhaps the enthusiasm which the
Revolution mud excite upon the sacred foil
of ancient liberty, will diltinguiih the insti
tutions of the revived Roman Republic with
the names and offices which flourished in
its better days. Tn(leadoFPrmaryA(Tembiies
we (hall probably hearcf the Comitia, and
Consuls infttad of an Executive Direftory
The modern Romans may thus eflablifh
tadem magi/lrcltuum vecafu/ar, but it remains
to be seen with what spirit the Reman iufti
tutrons are supported, and with what dignity
the men who have so recently escaped from
the ecclefiasrical yoke will maintain the li
berty they have reclaimed.
A considerable body of French troops,
confiding-both Â«f calvaryand infantry, werÂ«
daily expened atÃctttriiam, and wtre p>rN

Various conjedlures were made refpe&irtg
. the ultimate destination of these troops.â
The Government gives out, that they are
only to (lay at Rotterdam a few days, and
then to march towards the coast, as a part
of the army of England ; the Stadiholder's
party is appreheufive they are intended to
strengthen the hands of the Government,
in order to execute some violent me fures.
The Batavian Directory having sent a

porting, " that all those who refufe place*
for which they are appointed, (hall lose the
rights of citizens, and that it (hall be law

be rigorously maintained and executed.

PROPOSAL,
For Publijbing by Subscription,
AN
E N I R Y
INTO THE
ORIGII' OF EPTDEMIC DISEASES.
r-pHE Letters to Dr. Currie, which 1 publilhed
A last autumn, led me to an invefligation of
the origin and phenomena of peftihmial diseases
in other countries, as well as in the United St -tes.
In the profccution of the fubje&, new fa&s and
principles continually opened to my view, and fi
nally deternfincd nve to trace back the history of
such dife2fes as far as the records of history ex
tend. For this purpose, I have examined the pub
lic libraries in New-York, New-Haven, Gam
bridge and Boston, with a view to obtaih all the
material fa&s which can illustrate the fuhje<st,and
I have nearly colledcd all the materials for the
proposed work.
The fails eolL<Sled will enable me to demon
strate that many of the common ideas refpe&mg
pestilential epidemics, are unfounded or extreme
ly iucorreA ; and this in eonfcquence of rr.edicnl
writers cenfidering an epidemic disease as a detach
ed or isolated phenomenon in a particular coun
try ; rather than as conne&ed with other epide
mics or other phenomena of nature in various
parts of the world. "The fails I have collc&ed
'lead to certain dedu&ions which are furprifingto
myfelf, and which will probably be new to many
others. Much light will be thrown on this dark
and perplexing YubjeA, as well as on natural phi
losophy.
The proposed work will make a full Gzed o&a
---vo volume ; and executed well on fine papar, can
not be afforded at lels than two dollars, bound,
with the usual allowance to book-feller?. As thÂ«
compilation will cost not only great labor,but con
(iderable expence, no more copies will be printed
than to supply fuhferibers. The book will be rca
for fubicriber fearly iu the coming summer.and
the holders of propofaU will be good enough to
return them to No. 40, Piue-ftreet, by the firitof
