THE opinions of Mr. Jeffcrfbn, relative to the '
present conjlitution of the United Stalci, ate nextjh) 1
order to be con(id:ied. :
r . If he is not aut'ifederal, it will not be denied that
he entertained very conlidt'rable objc&ioaa to the '
33 constitution, -and that his advice 'to call a second 1
convention, if adopted, would have prevented our
having ever obtained so good a one. '
Some of his opinions, relative to the constitution/ e
are to be found in a feiies of letters, written from 1
Paris, in the yeai3 1783 and "Partial extracts '
from these letters were publiftied in 1 j, by s ffrend t

breaking out in the upperpart of the house ; they
buried out, but soon found ;that Mrs. Campbell's (
eldest Ton, aibout 10 years old, and a black child, ,
were left in the chamber ; upon which a black wo
pian ran up to rescue them, but unfoitunately pe- (
rifhed with the children* in the devouring flames. ,
The neighbours assembled but found it impjflible ,
to flop the fire, or to save the poor black woman, ,
who was discovered during the fire, with one of f
the children in her aims laying across the floor j
beams. All the furniture, and about 600 dollars <

e( l But forced oÂ» all fides by the valour of our soldiers,
ta ' victory tefided finally.with us. We killed a great

Among the killed there is an Auflrian general. 1

"â¢ to their middle. The pafition being forced, the in- t
fantry ptirfued the enemy. Our cavalry, after hav- t
3r ing routed the enemy, pierced in a column the line e
rs of their infantry, which was effectuating their re- v

The attack was executed in three columns, com- 9
