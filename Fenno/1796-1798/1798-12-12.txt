â¢ ward the Fourth (1461 83) had fevtral
(hips of his own, which he employed some- t

tht King's service was praÂ£lifed at this time t
s perhaps even earlier. "It appears that our 1
, (hips were now built larger ; for in the car

e were much smaller, and even confided, for
g the moll part, of (ingle decked vessels, with
one mast only. In the famous Armada of
Edward the fourth (1475) though it con
fided of 1100 vefiels, the men oa board them - r
were only 11,166, very little more than 10
men per veflel ; and though in the propor

f them a little bigger, they do not exceed 16
- men per vessel, even in that class."

" Since our firft arrival on the eop.it we

ter we failed from Baffa; the Pilgrim in com
pany with two small ones, and appeared to
make a (ignal. We kept under the land to v !
prevent them feeing us, concluding they were
the squadron. Next day came to anchor at P
Maffurado, in expectation they had palled 1
to leeward. The night after a crew came P
from Bafi'a, told its that a two decked (hip }'
with 40 guns had taken the Young Ralph "
and St. Philip, off (Harrow, and was coming P
tip aft: r us.âWe immediately got under way r '
in company with the St. Anne, Pilgrim and
Jolhua and flood out throe days ; tame back

Ccpc Mount, and on the 30th lying at f

th-; fbuthward ; made the . signal to the St.
Anne tÂ® t'et under way immediately. The P
Pilgrim having a copy of ourtignals, got un
der way also.
" As focvn as the St. Anne came up, I
took my station astern of her, finding it was
impodibl" for her to eli ape if I left her, P
thinking better to risque' an action, than bertr
the name of run-a-way, tl'Â£ Pilgrim being a *
long way astern, (horteiied fail for her to

tervvards informed by capt. Mentor, who '
was unfortunately captured by Iter) was call- c
ed the Convention, capt. Rolcow, two ''
months from Dunkirk, carries jagtjrts, and ?
20 f men, had taken four ihips. She bore â¢!
down on the St. Anus and Ellis, and com-
nleaped a brisk fire, which we returned with
all the strength we were masters of. After
a little, finding us rather .stronger than !he c
expected, ihe filled, I luppofe, with an inten
tion to rake the St. Anne. I immediately *
filled jjand (hot a-head of the St, Anne, to J!
leeward and met her, being little more tharw
1 good mulket (hot apart, and received her
uroudlide, beingÂ»we!l prepared to pv her
for her trouble. She finding our fliot heav- C
ier than Ihe expected, made fail in a greater F
hurry than fhetook it in. Mv running rig
ging being very much cut, file got out of e
reach of my guns, before I cnuld let my top 1

PHILADELPHIA ,
WEt)NESD.AY EVENING, DECEMBER 11.
'This Day the Senate, in a body, -waited on j h
the President of the United States, and \
prefentcd him the following : |
ANSWER. â¢ 1
n
TothePitesiDENT of the Unit ed States, v
SIR, 0
THE Senate of the United States join j
you in thanks to Almighty God for the re- n
moval of the late afflicting dispensations of c
his Providence, andfor the patriotic sfi
*lT, and general prosperity of our country, j
Sympathy for the fufferings of our fellow- t|
citizens, from difsafe, and the important in- a
terefts of the Union, demand of the nation-
al legislature a rjacfy co-operation with the â
State governments, in theufeof such means
is seem belt calculated to prevent the return of
this fatal calamity.
Although we have since rely wished that
an adjustment of our differences with the re- 11
public of France might be effected on fafe
and honorable terms, yet the information
you have given us of the ultimate failure of P
the negociation has not surprized us. In rt
the general conduit of that Republic, we have o:
seen adefigj) of nni%-erfat inttuince, incofTl- ' â¢
patible with the felf government, and defti-uc
tive of the independence of other ftatrs.
In its conduit towards, these United States,
"we have fecn a plan of hollility pursued with
unremitted constancy, equally disregarding P
the obligations of treaties, and the rights of .
individuals. We ha\r fee;i two embaflies "
formed for the purpqfe of mutual explanati
ons, and clothed with the most extensive and
liberal powers, dismissed without recognition,
and evep without a hearing. P'
The government 0t" France has not only
refilled to repeal, but has recently 0
the observance of its former edict, refpectinp; 0
merchandize of Britilh fabric or produce, the
property of neutrals, by which, the inter
ruption- of our. lawful commerce, and the
spoliation of the property of our citizens have
again received a public fanftionâThefe fa its
indicate no change of system or disposition ei
they ipeak a more intelligible language than
profeflions of solicitude to avoid a rupture,
hov/ever ardently made. But, if after the P
repeated proifs we have given of a sincere
desire for peace, these profeflions should be w
accompanied by insinuations, implicating the
integrity with which it has been purfuedâlf w
neglecting and passing by the constitutional in
and authorized agents of the government ol
they are made thr<*ugh the medium of indi
viduals withoutpubliccharadter or authority i"
âand above all, if they carry with them asa
claim to prescribe the political qualifications w
of the minister of the United States, to be ar
employed in the negotiation, they are not en- m
titled to attention or consideration, but ft;
ought to be regarded as designed to separate in
the people from their government, and to to
bring about by intrigue that which open w
force could uot effelt. flj
We are of opinion with you, Sir, that b<
there has nothing yet been discovered in the
conduit of FwnCe which can juftify a relaxa- nj
tion of the%ieans of defence adopted during a r
the last feliion of Cwngrefs, the happy rel'ult C c
of which is so strongly and generally marked, th
If the force by feaand land which the existing cl
laws authorifr should be judged i nadequate to c Â«
the public defence, we will perform the in- di
dispensable duty of bringing forward such fli
other afts as will effeftually call forth the tfc
resources and force of our ecufitry.
A steady adherence to this wife and manly ; n
policyâa projxr direltioh of the nob It spirit a l
of patriotii'm which has arilen in our country ; t
and which ought to be che riffled and in
vigorated by every branch of the government, n:
will (ecure our liberty and independence a
gainst all op< n and secret attacks.
enter on the- buiinefi of the present
i.-iTton with an anxious solicitude fr j, the
public good, and shall bestow tliat conlaicra
tion on the several objects pointed out in â¢"Â£
your communication, which thev rrfpe-ftively
merit.

REP L r :
To the Senate of the United States
Gentlemen,,
I thank you for this address, so confcr
irlible to the fpirii as our constitution, ana ,
the established character of the Senate of the
United States, for '.villlom, honor and virtue.
I have ea no real evidence of any change |
of system or difpofitidn in the French repub- ]
lie, towards tli? United States. Although' ,
the officious interference of individuals, with- ,
out public character of authority, is not en- j
titled to any credit, yet it dHerves to be con- ,
lidered, whether that temerity and imp-'i'ti- ,
nence of individuals, affecting to interfere ,
in public affairs, between France and the j
United States, whether by their secret cor- (
refpondence, or othenvii's, and intended to |
impofc upon the people, and feperate them ,
front their government, ought not to "be in- j
quired into and corrected. ]
I thank you, Gentlemen, for your 3 flu- (
ranees that you will be flow that consideration ]
on the several objects, pointed out in my
communication, u liich they reijwetivoly merit.
If 1 have participated in that und.iTt.ind- f
ing, since rity and constancy, which have been
di (played by my fellow-citizens and country
rr.Jii, in the molt trying times and critical ,
lituations, and fuifdldfc-my duties to them, I â 
am happy. The of the Senate of 1
the United State?, iir my favor, is an high
an.l honorable reward, -which receives, as it (
merits, my grateful acknowledgements.- My (
zealous co-op.'ration, in me.il'ures neceflai y j
to lecure us justice and co mid; rat ion, may be
always depended on.

m"r. fenno,
I observe several pieces in Mr. Brown's
paper of last evening in reply to Mr. Cob
! belt's attack upon meâAs Mr. Cobbett
j has heretofore thought proper to ascertain (
| the authors of anonymous pieces, he may ;
i take the fame liberty again. I therefore j
think proper to declare publicly that I am . (
not the author of those pieces nor do I know
who is.âWhen any attack (nail be made up-
: on me which will require my answer, it will
not be given by anonymous publicationsâ i
My defence will be accompanied by my '
name ; but as yet I have discovered no oc- ,
csfion for defence. A fait k stated in the 1
piece figrttd " Clitus" which has proceeded c
I suppose from a declaration I have made '
to several of my friendsâl have declared '
and I now declare, that I have never Jhaken
hands with Wm. Cobbtlt in my life. In Au- !
gust lad, just at I was about leaving the !
Washington tavern, Mr. C. came up. As
he flood in ibe piazza, apd I by my sulky '
at some distance from the door, the saluta
tion of ,l How do you do Sir," passed be- f
tween usâl know not who gave it firft, 1
nor is it very notarial. A few words then '

GENTLEMEN,
The Corporation of this City have defir- 1
ed me to transmit to your Worfhipful Body, C
Two f houfand Dollars, for the benefit of
their diftrefTed fellow citizens of Philadel- !
phia. This small sum is a part of certain '
liberal donations to the citizens of this place '
who ftiffered by the fires in the months of C
November and December 1796. There 3
will be lent on by the fame daft of people, 3
in the course of a few days, a further sum ?
of about one thousand dollars.
The citizens of Savannah, besides claim-
ing to participate their full share of the sen
sations naturally excited by the calamities a
with which your city has been viiited, â
are feelingly alive to the generous and hu
mane conduit of the Legislature of your
state, and the inhabitants of Philadelphia, ?
in the hour of their distress j and have only "
to regret that these their, feeble efforts to- "
wards alleviating the fufferings of their af
flifted brethren of Philadelpuia, have not
been earlier exerted. 3
Notwithstanding the citizens of Savan
nah are aware of the resources Â®f your city, -j
and are apprized of the notification of your
committee of health ; yet they cannot deny
thcmfelves the pleasure of acknowledging
their good will ; and of begging your ac
ceptance of this small boon in behalf of such j
diftrefied families, as may have felt the as-
flifting hand of Providence in the cotirfe of \
the summer and fall.
A fubferiptiou has been opened for the J
inhabitants of this city to con.ribute gener- â
ally. It is expelled that the proceeds of r
it will ready to be sent on in a few days. e

TO THE PEOPLE OF VIRGINI A.
j Fellaw Ciiitttu,
I for multiplying objeÂ£ti<ins
! againlt the Sedition Law, the remwdrance
i ftqtcs, " that a law hus penal ought to have
: bren deftrred in its operation until it could
he promulgatedâa law which encounters
rooted prcpofiefiions in fjivor of the freedom
of the pr<fj ouv-ht to have been tanked a
mong legifldtive exp?riments," See.
if it introduced a new offence, or if it'
introduced new penaltits, I it fliould
have been promulgated before it went into
operation. But neither the offences nor pe
nalties are new, as has been fully aemon
ftrated. â¢ Previous to the law the offences
were known to exist under the appellation of
misdemeanors, for which fine and itnprifon
ment were the ufnal penalties. Indeed the
penalties at common law are under the dif
cretionof the courts, but being now lrm ted
by the aft of congress, so that the fine nv-iy
not exceed a certain sum of money, nor the
imprifoninent a certain space of time, the
law seems entitled rather to the praise of mo
deration and lenity than to the cetifure of
harshness and severity.
But why, if unconstitutional, should a '
diltant day have beea appointed for its ope-,
ration ? or why rank it among legislative i
experiments? If unconstitutional, it is void, ,
and never can have'effeftâif unconstitution
al, it never should be a legislative experiment.
What do we fee in this remonstrance ?â>
men profeffing an affeftionate regard for the '
constitution, denounciig a law as a violation '
of it, and at the fame time avowing the fen j
t ment that this law, this violation of the'
constitution, should have been a legislative ',
experime I. Far different ought to be thi j
feiitiment of my fellow-citizens. They 1
the constitution as the sacred
palladium of their and rights
\ âLet it not be violated direftly or indirect
lyâlet it n-it be destroyed either by open J
violence or infurreflion, or undermined by '
1 fopi.'ip.ry and mifcontl' uQ'ton. The means of
destruction, whether of the one fort or of
i the oihcr, should be abhorredâThere is
more to fear frÂ«m the latter than from the
former. There is 3iore to fear from a doc
trine that denies to it the rights of felf pre
servation, and dwindles it into imbecility
and nothingness, than from open rebellion,
j Moreover the remonstrance, pursuing thij
objection, endeavours to enforce it by faying
that the Sedition Law oflght the have beea
ranked legiflau've experiments ioftead
of being retained in force for more than two
years and a half longer than perhaps the
existence of the exigency which countenan
ced its birth, but long enough for one party
tvÂ» pervert it to the vexation, persecution and
impoverishment of its political enemies."
Here I will observe, if there is any fault in
the law, it must be that its duration is limited
at all- The offences which it punishes should
always be punished, and therefore the law,
if it were necefTary, should not have been
temporary, but perpetual. Perhaps the law
was not indifpenlably necefTary, because
without it the fame misdemeanors ware pu
njfhabl , and after its expiration will be pu
s nifhable by the judicial power of the United
States, as they are all cases "at law arising
under the csnjlitution" of the Uaited States.
Many things not necefTary may be expedient
and so this law may be ultimately found.
To agitate and inflame you yet more, it
is asserted in the remopftrance, that" the
law will be long enough in force for one
| party to pervert it, to the vcxa-ion, perse
cution, and impoverishment of its political
enemies"âthat thojgh " the right of glv
j ing in evidence the truth of a libel, is a pro
-1 teftion to the accused, it will in the moll
: important instances be a vision instead of a
fubflance,"and because with thefirmnefs of
freemen, the remonllrants adhere torefpeS for
office, they will not descend to the painful
talk of fuggefling how this may be done,
and probably will happen." Indecent and
unjult as this attack is upon the Judiciary of
our country, my refpeet to the people of
the (late whom I address, shall reft rain the
indignation which it has excited. In offer
ing to the public my ideas on the two laws,
which have been misconceived by too many
of my fellow-citizens faithfully and affeftion
ately attached to the Afwerican government,
and which, by a few reltlcfs, unhappy, dis
appointed, and mischievous individuals, have
been grossly misrepresented, for the worst
of purposes, it was my determination to be
silent upon such affertious and irifinuations
as I have just recitedâin that determina
tion I perfilt. For us all it may be a
source of inestimable felicity, that the ad
ministration of the Judiciary department i#
placed with judges, whose experience, learn -
ing, and integrity make them an orna
ment and blefling to our common country
and who will never permit any law to be
perverted to the vexation or oppreflion of
any ef us.

The celebrated Edmund Burke's opinion
of the people of New-Englanfl, in one of '
his speeches delivered in the British Parlia
ment in the year 1775.
"As to the wealth which tlie colonies have 1
drawn from the sea by their fifheries, you
had all that matter fully opened at your bar.
You surely thought those acqitilitions of va
lue, for they fcemed even to excite your en
vy ; and yet the spirit with which that e'nter
priling employment has been exercised, ought '
rather, in my opinion, to have raised your \
esteem and admiration. And pray, fir, what ,
in the world is equal to it ? Pass bv the other I
parts, and look at the manner in which the ]
people of New-England have of late carried
on the whale tifherv. Whilst we follow j
them among the rambling mountains of ice, ,
and behold them penetrating into the deepest 1
frozen recefles of Hudfoa's bay, and Davis's
ftieights ; whilst we are looking for them be- 1
ntath the artie circle, we bear that tlÂ«fy' have
pierced intq the oppof.te region of polar cold,
1
that they are at the antipodes, and engaged

tic an object for thsgnil'p of national am'oi
t:on, is !>ut/sa arid resting place i;i the
progress ol t.ieir victorious industry. Nor
is t:ie equinoxial heat more difconragirig to
thorn, th.ia the accumulated winter of both
the poles. We know that vMiiHt font.: of
draw the l:n; aftvJ flrike the harpoon on
th: coast or Africa, others run the longitude,
and pursue their gigantic game along the
coau of Braz 1. No fca but what is vexed
by thiir fillliries ; no climate that is not wit
ness to their toils. Neither thv peri'everance
of HollanJ, nor the activity of France, nor
the dexterous and firm sagacity of English
enterprise, ever carried this molt perilous
mode of hardy industry to the extent to which
it has been pu flied by this recent people ; a
â¢ people who are still, as it were, but in the
j grilHj, and not hardened in the bone of man
hood. When I contemplate those things,
v wnen I know that the colonics in genera! owe
litttle or notJliug to any care of ours, and
that they are not squeezed into this happy
form by the conltraints of watchful and sus
picious governments, but that through a wife
and salutary negleCt, a generous nature has
â¢ been fuffered to fake her own way to pcr
fection ; when I retted upon these effects,
I when I fee how profitable they have been to
us, I feel all the pride of power fink, and all
. preemption in the wisdom of human con
j irivances, melt and die away within me !"
