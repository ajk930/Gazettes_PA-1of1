PROSPEC T-H I L L,
I Situated within oae quarter of a mile from the Brandywinc
I Mills, and hall a mile from the borough of Wilmington.
<"pHE dwelling house is built of stone, two (lories high,
A gentcrlr finifhed, and containsfour handfomc raomi on
a floor, besides an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
cellars. It is generally thought to commjnd the most a
greeable profneft of the Delaware, from the source of that
I rlvsi to the Capes. This prolpeft ia greatly embellished by
I a full view of a vafl body of meadow, through which the
Clirilliam and Brandy wine creeks are seen winding in beau*
| titul meanders. Nesr the house are a Kitchen, a fpaotoua
I stone and hayloft, a barn, a carriage house, mflk-
I hoafe, &c. 'and a well of as puie as any on the conti
nent. The garden coutains an acre and quarter of land, a
bounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, of
[) r y I the very belt kind, brought from Maryland, and in full bear.
' \ ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a young, apple
i orchard begining to bear, and leveral old trees that produce
jn. I abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental trees, in
great numbers. The farm confiftt of near sixty acres of land,
| of good quality, and clear of incumbrances, except taxes,
twenty of which arenÂ»w in exoellcnt clover and timoihy,
and ten more will be ready for Towing nexl spring. A rÂ«-
thtir Hderice et nearly 8 years has convinced the fubferiber that
jrices Vhe fnuation is remarkably healthy, The great poll toad
v no- from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within seventy
ining yards of the house. In a word, the beauties and conveni
ence of this situation cannot be enumerated in an advertise
ment, and when examined, will probably command the at
tention of any person who is difirous of living at one of the
mod elegant country feau on the continent. The puretwfrr

Philadelphia, December 10.
d Yeltcrday at twelve o'clock, both hotifci of the
Legislature of this commonwealth, being affeflfibfed
in the Senate chamber, the Governor delivered to
them the following %
SPEECH.
Gentlemen of the Senate, aid
Gentlemen of the House of Reprrfentativci ;
INVESTED with the arduous, though honour
able trust, of legislating for a free and enlightened
people, you w ill be gratified in contemplating so fa
vourable an opportunity, for the peiformance of
your duties, as theprefent feafo*of peace and prof
pen'ty.
To provide for the prefcrvation and admtnidra
tion of the republican system, under wlii- h our
eountiy has 8-iuridicd beyond example ; âto im
prove and protect the inilttu'tiohs, that are design
ed for the advancement of vir ue, (he flidemination
of knowledge, and the adim nftration Â«f juHice ; â
and to multiply the means, by which every species
of honest indudry, m>y be effectually encouraged
and rewarded ; are the great objeSs confided to
r Â» your wisdom and patriotism. For thefeobjects (it
mud be allowed) mush has already been done ; but
it is implied in their vciy nature, that mueh will al
wayÂ» remain to db : the increase of population,
ie the extension of agriculture and commerce, the
progress of arts, and the inevitable viciffi'udf of
e human puffions and purfui:9, csÂ» never fail to fur
" nifh occasions, for the of legislative care
.1 and authority.
j While affording the aid to your deliberations,
0 which the conftitu:ion requires from the executive
migiflra'e, permit mc, gendemes, so suggest some
of the amendments, of which our laws, on these
y fundmental points, appear to be susceptible.
in lelittion to the organization, and the operati
ons of a representative republic, the rights and rules <
_ of el'cflion, demand peculiar attention. From the 1
complex character of our political association, the 1
e rights of fiffrrtge may be acquired in various modes >
âby birth,hy natural 7-ation in thiicommonwealth,
; or by naturalization in a;iy of our filter common- 1
2 wealths ; âbut the fucceilive changes of the (late '
t and federal constitutions, have so deranged the pro- '
e visions which the law had previouHy made, that a '
declaratory has become necessary, it is thmght. 1
j to render the fubjedt clear (it it ought to be) to '
every undemanding. The atlop i 11 of fueh a mea
:, sure, extending to a general rtvifion of the election 1
c laws, I trust it will be deemed expedient tÂ® iucor- '
' porate into one system, all the regu'rions that rt?f- 1
peift the federal, as well as (late offices, and to in- 1
troduce additional fanflions, for fecuiing,' at this â 
e lource of the health and vigor of the body politic, (
1 purity and independence, vigilance and impartiality, '
3 The difficulties, which have arisen in the '
E election and returns of the electors of a President 'â¢
:, and Vice-PiefiJent of the United S ates, have re- I
â¢ cently attracted the public attention, and are pecu- '
liarly calculated to enfurce any rccoitmendatioÃ, on 1
t the iiitet*fji'ig fubjeift, ta which I l ave just adver- '
> ted. By the law, it is made the duty of the pro- \
tho-notarics te dv'.ivÂ«nltÂ«-Tctttâ¢a oi thrtTTefpeei 1
tive counties within 14 days after the election ; and '
it is made the duty of the executive to enumerate 1
the votes, to proclaim the electors having a tnsjori- 1
ty t>f votes, and to cause those elcitorg to be uoti- 1
1 fiid of their election, on, or befoi* the last Wed- {
nefday of the month. In a few of the counties, )
however, the votes of particular diltr'cU for various, t
reasons, wvrc not included, in the general returns-; f
and the returns of several of the remote counties c
were not received, when the term, pr-fqribed to 1
the protho-notaiies, for executing their trust, hud "
j expired. By the precedent, aftablifhed on the opi- r
nion of the judges and the attorney-general at the '
eleÂ£tion of eledors in the year 1792, and confirm- t
rll in the fame manner on the late oecaiion, the li- 0
mitatLn imposed on theprotho notaries, could only 1
be conftdered as directory with refpeft to the/'reon- 'J
duÂ£t, and not as an exclusion of returns delivered t
at a subsequent period : The limitation imposed r
likewifeon the executive magistrate mud be confi
dered as' Hill referring it to his difcrrtion to delay : a
enumerating the votes, and proclaiming the public , n
choice, for any period, that.was com r aub!e with 'tl
the delivery of official netifications to the eleilorÂ»v J ti
on the dry designated by the Legifliture. Witb )It
this authoritative exposition e>[ the law of ti
positive infoimation that elections had been held in ' p
all [j** countics ; and concluding from repeated d
ftatenients communicated to me, ihat the returns n
had been fraudulently intercepted, or accidentally tl
postponed, I determined, contraiy to my fiiit m- | ti
tention, but upon matuie confideratior>, a r,<J wl " t h h

As the best pi oof of the propriety of this deter- d

and order, in tranlading the bufinef# of ule&ions,
cannot be fufficient to preclude investigation, in
contradidion to evidegceand reason, nor toefiablirti
he error, at the expence of truth and justice. It is
id that the ail rifpedtng the choice ofeledors,
to nas not provided a fpecific mode for examining and
deciding upon the controversies- which have arifcn,
and, probably, will often rife, at election* of such
importance j but it is the conflitutional duty of the
executive to take care, that all the laws
of the (late (hall be faithfully executed ; and it is
ir- my earned wish, that the expression of the legiflv
ed j tive will, may - always be made so explicit and fa
Fa- ample, as to leave nothing for conftru&ion to ex
o'f plain, or discretion to supply.
jf. It will be universally acknowledged, that to
guard a republican government again ft internal en
â¢a. croachments, or external violenet, a well organized
ur and well difciplinrd militia, is the only fafe and ef
ti- ficient iuftrument 5 and yet, it is, also, obvious,
n- that the police of Pennsylvania is not, in any re
in fpe&i fore feeble ahd defective. Let it then he
_ remembered, that the dang-r of forÂ»ign hostility
es ( hough I anxionfly hope it is remote) il not a vi
sionary evil j aud that the emergencies will fome
to times anfe in the beil ordered communities, which
it the power of the civil magiflrate is not competent
ut to encounter. In either cafe, if the militia ca not
il. be seasonably embodied, it will be found hazardous t
n, and improvident, to ttuft the defence and tra-quil 1
jc lily of the date, to the only alternatives that oc <
of cur; âa permanent military force, or the casual |
r- exertion of volunteers. Upon this topic, hower- <
re ver, gentlemen, every opportunity has been em- <
braced, to engage the attention of the legiflatute ; t
s, par.icularly, at a period, when the reputation, if <
te nor the security, of our government was menaced j 1
ie and when a greater expence was incurred to obvi- r
fe ate, in a lingle inftancr, the cinbarraflTments prp- t
duced by the imperfe&ion of the existing law, than -i
[. W 'uld be neeeflary for conftamly maintaining, in
a Hate of preparation and energy, a judicious and t
, e liberal eltablirtiment of the militia. Referring, r
ic therefore, to the records of the general aflembly, a
tB and to the report of the adjutant-general, which 1
), will be laid before you, for a fpecification of the r
). impiovements efifentially requiftte, I can only add e
e an opinion, fortified by every day's experience, t
). that the duty which we owe to our immediate con- I
a ilituents, our federal obligations, public convetii- v
t. ence, and genuine ecotromy, concur in recommand v
0 ing a prompt and radical reform. i
j. That a general diffufion of tifeful knowledge
n mong the citizens of a republic, serves invariably a
p . to repress the spirit of licentious reft, and to che- t
f. rifh a sense of rational liberty, the history of na- I
1. tioils, and the speculations of philosophers, are, r
; s alike, calculated to demonstrate. ImprefTed, -in- p
deed, with this important truth, the framers of v
r t our eonftitution have emphatically imposed 3n ob- t
e ligation upan the legislature, to devise and establish t
it as) (l< mof education, "in ftith'manner, that the r
poor, throughovit the (late, may be taught gratis." e
1. Independent, therefore, of the motives, which it
n wc uld, otherwise, Â«<Sluare every wife and benevo- Â».
â . lc:it statesman, all the offspring of indigence and o
penury have an interesting Sc incontrovertibly right ti
. to the enjoyment <>f a public premfttm, Pir the il- 13
J Inmiiiation of their minds, and the cultivation of t
e their faculties. But, (till, regarding the inftitu- ti
tion only as an auxiliary to perpetuate the bleffirtgs .it
[. of a free government, and to assimilate the lan- a
|. guage, feutiments, a\id manners of the ciCzcns, v<
S) you will sot, lam confident, gentlemen, allow it ti
to be retarded by the fuggeftioiis of a parsimonious ti
. policy; nor to be fettered by any reftriiflion, pro- w
s feeding from local jealousy, or habitual prejudice, o
0 Every of the community is i:ttere(led in the ti
j well being of the whole: the-fecurity of each d
. member will always, in some degree, depend upon e
e the intelligence and virtue of the reft: And thus, tl
. the measure now contemplated, as well as every si
. other measure for the public benefit, is nothing tl
y more, in fad, than a common medium, through
. which all the individuals of the fame faciely, (how- It
J ever clh'fed, and wherever (ituated) infallibly de- p
J rive a jail proportion of advantage. fl
so this branch of our review, maybe properly ti
j 1 annexed the considerations thut refpcA the depart- o
: | ments, and public offi es, in which the business of o
1 â  the (late is tranfacled; since it must be nugatory 'I
v , to u-cogfiize the theory of a free government, , un

il plied ; and independent of it* charitable uses, |, as
driuotlef*, produced many salutary effects a* an ad

Â» nuance of your bounty is necessary, as the ouljr
- means of fapport, and for whom, at this season Jf
i. t 1 e year, your humanity cannot fail to be deeply
i -interefled.
i Directing year attention, gentlemen, to the
3 means by which the iodtiftry of our fellow citizen
, may be encouraged, and rendered mi ll produce
, and beneficial to the community, it will at once be
l difcernod, that'the intetefts of foricty arefoin i.
; raatclv interwoven, and so mutually dependant, thât
1 endowments, which might fupe.-ficially feetn to !Â«

- lar art, science, or occupation, may always, nel
- verthelefs, be accurately traced throughout the
whole circle of our avocations and purfuii*, diffuf
ing a benign and salutary influence.
But the relations of agrictiltuie and commerce
r are, at this period of our national independence,,
the mod obvious, and perhaps the mud important,
to be canfidered cultivated. In order,' theiefore,
, reciprocally to promote' tbofe effentiil iatereii â ,
permit me earnestly to recommend a liberal perlc-
F vetance in tfie policy, of extending and fact .
â¢ the communication between the different parti of
i the date by every practicable mode, of roads, of
â  rivers of bridges, and t/Snals. Indeed, the fpiritul
' example which your prrdtceffora gÂ«vc, has excite',
i in one of our lifter Kates at let it, aa emulation I >,Â«/,
Â».Â£tive, as to demand fotne extraordinary cjcerliVr '
on out part, merely for preserving. that portiofc T
the benefits grifing'from an fnterecarfe >y?& the
WCElilll w Atsr*, to local
: tion, and other natural advantages, have jtilily en.
titled us. The towns that have been laid out, anj
i jn part fold (at a corifh'wable price) on lak* Erie,
and the western bordeis of the state, seem, like- i
wife only to require the means of free communica
tion, to ensure a rapid population,, and profptrous
i trade. But it may be prcptr here to revive the idea
which was intimated to the legifljturc on a former
occasion, that if a part of e*ch of tlie reserved
traÂ£tÂ» ill the neighbourhood of those towns, wsj
divided into farms of convenient extent, and grant. Jaj
td, for a moderate coiif/deratiort to aftual-iculers,
the rneafure wotiid sfford additional fecurrty to the '
frontier inhabitants, and at the fame time enhance
the value of the remaining public property.
1 n all these efforts, however, to augment the opu
lence of the state, by extending the sphere of po
pulation and settlement, every poifibie ptecautien
(heuld be obfeivtd to prevent the feuds and litiga
tions which aie produced by thecollilioH of tides,
or by a Ipecieus oppotition of the equitable claim
of an or the legal rights of a patentee.
The appearance on our weliern trams rÂ« th s
refpedt, of a nature to excite some and
to demand immediate care : nor will it be foum!,
upon examining the documents which 1 hi>vÂ» direc.
ted to be laid before you. that the territorial cor.
troverfy at Wyoming, which has so long violated
the public authority,-and disturbed the pHblicpeicr,
is at all abated in its virulence, or audacity. In
compliance with the request of the legislature, a
proclamation, rtlatsve to the latter object, was is
sued, and communicated to the governors of New*
Yoik, Maffael.ufet;*, Rbode-Ifland, and Connee
titut ; and it affords me great pleasure publicly ">
acknowledge the alacrity and decision with which,
in every iuftance, except perhaps in the intt?nce of
ConneAicut, I was honoured with the aurhorit?.
tive co-operation of those magillrates. But it is
evident, from the systematic proceedings oi the
lawleft intruders on the Wyoming di(tri6t, that mes.
fures, more opeiative than those which hive hither
to been fan&ioned by the legislature, miift he n
dopted,'to evince the power, and aifert the right",
of the commonwealth ; Unless, under the pe. uhÂ»r
circumi'lances of this controveify, it fltsil be th< t
mttft equitable and prudent, to promote a compp'- t
mile between the parties, by allowing either .
them to take, in comimitatiwu for the lands no n
claimed, a proporcional quantity ar iiuapproprtatr
public lands, in apy other part of the (late.
When considering the direct aid vvhLh the

prize, it can scarcely be neceffaiy to rema:*., i-1
these ought ever to be diltinguifhed in then trea.-
ment, as they ate ever diltinguilhable 'Â« t fir na
ture, from the wild and faicinating movements o
the fpjrit of fpe.ulationâa spirt: that never feus "
taint the morals, and to blight the credit o, the ra
tion which is exposed to its malignant influence.
Though it i* imp' ffible, tndcr the pii'fen' c,rc
ftaneesof our c..uÂ»try, to avoid noticing tlri" <
and perhaps laraeriti that our governmei -, ' )
jindifcriraioate falc of the pub'ic lanes, -i- 8hated ta create it ; 1 will not pretend, gentlemen,
that it it in my power to fugged, or in your's to
provide, an adequate remedy. Some reformation,
however, w#uld probably be produced, by aug
menting the penalties again [I all kinds of gambling
âby amending the laws for the relief of insolvent
debtor*âand by reviving the aft for the regulation
Â©f bankruptcy. It must be remembered, likewise,
that every measure which tends to annihilate a fic
titious credit, and to counterafl a fraud in trade,
will, with equal force, invigorate the real capital of
our commerce, and encourage its fair and salutary
operations. And if, after the eftahlidiment of a sys
tem that will do ample justice to creditors, by pre
venting their debtorj from committing a wr.de or
concealment of pioperty, you (hall I e riifaofej to
abolilh the practice of imprisonment for debt, the
principles of our couditutio-, of tK? common law,
and of found policy l will, in my opinion, warrant
and approve the aA.
At the opetrng of the lad session, it was intima
ted, that tlie footing on which marine insurances,
inland bills of exchange, and promissory notes, ex
ited in Peanfylvania, might be rendered more se
cure and fa isfaiftory to the public, by adopting, in
relation to the refpe&ive objects, fnch of the po
sitive regulations of foreign countries, as experi
ence had proved to be beneficial. Allow me, under 1
the preflura of encreafing inducements, to renew
the recommendation at this time ; and particulaily
to observe, that the preference given hy law to pro
mifTory notes, discounted at the bank of Pennfyl
vinia, (an inditution in which the (late has veiled
its pecuniary capital) has been deemed a singular
departure from the disinterested and liberal policy,
that charafierifvs onr legislative code.
Having thm reviewed the general fitua'ion of the
public affairs, and cursorily pointed-out the princi
pal improvement that may be made in our police,
I proceed, gentlemen, with the highed fatisfa&ion.
to inform you, that the date of our finances will
assure to all your undertakings, for advancing the
interest and happiness of our corfftituenn, an abun
dant and constant supply of_ wealth. Ti-e debta
and duties paid into the treasury, from the fir ft of
January to the firft of November lad, (to which
(everal important payments have finee been added)
amount tothefumof 265,580d011ars and 82 cents;
and this fum,together with the pre-exilling bjlancc
of 90,189 dollars and 52 cents, cÂ»ndi;ute a fund
355'77Â° dollars and 24 centÃ, which is much
moie than fufficient to meet all :he.contifiger* i<.j of
the expiring year. For, the dedudtion to he made
during the correfpording period, in order to de
fray the expencesof government, to discharge the
public debts, to advance tl.e public improvements,
(including the fcveral grauts for enlarging the Penn
sylvania liofpital, and finishing the house intended
for the accemmodation of the President) and to
supply the variety of miscellaneous disbursements,
dated in the report for the department of accounts,
amounting only to the sum of 282,444 dollars, will
be found to have left in'the treasury, on the firft of
November lad, a specie balance of, at lead, 73,326
dollars. . ,
The principal fourees of revenue, which ha*c
been edablifhed, preclude, likewise, (as I have da
red) the spprrbmetion of failuve . ur disappoint
ment, in prosecuting on a liberal and judicious scale
the important obje&s of your admtuidration.
From the public capital, veded in the Bank of
Pennsylvania, an ahnual dividend of 90.000 dol
lars mrty be confidently expefied. From the dock
of the United States, which is the propeity ol Penn
sylvania, an annnal sum of about 6,679 dollars is
now enjoyed ; which, when enereafed hy the e
*entful produfl of the deferred Rack, will amount
to an annual sum of about 35,690 dollars, liable,
however, upon the payment of the principal, ac
tording to the dipulated indalmcjai.jf the arts of
Cdngrefs, to be gradually diminifccd, and finally
extinguished at the close of the year 1818. Frcm
the duties k fees colleflcd oÂ« tavern & marriage li
cences, on sales at audlion, and in the public offi
ces, we may compute an annual accumulation of -
50,000 dollars : And the combined result of these
ftveral items, con flit utir.g the ascertained revenues
of the date, fumilhei an income of 146,69 a dol
lzrs.
But it .mud, also, be taken into our view, that
the contingent refourcesarifmg from the arrearages
of tuxes, from the salts of the town and out-IÂ»;s on
.Lake Erie, and on the western frontier (including
the forfeited lots in the town opposite Pittsburgh,
which I direfled to be disposed of,-J "frum the re- I
ceipts of the Land-Office, and from the coIIe&ioH
of various debts, will in the piogrefs of several years
greatly augment the eliding capital of the date. i

mutates from litre to time, in the treasury ; and u
which, according ro the exiding f) stem, will often, I
for a corfiderable period, and to a great amount,

1 gentlemen, be deemed ohtrufive or improper, at

obligation created in the A merican mind an honor
able predileflipn for the CEufe of the French peo

tion of a fyrtem, !>y which .u.ne of the belligerent
powers might have renfon to complain of ihe"viola

have flourifhtd lii arts .itid opulence ; the face ot
the country has beer improved and beau

war, has been consummated by the cessation ~f In
dian hcdilities on our frontiers; nor will it be elli
matrd as a gratification of ineonfiderable value,
that the exertions of the federal government have,
at length, releeled our unfortunate fellow-citizens
from the Algeri-e enpfivi'y, fedori-ig them to ci

But/at this moment, gentleme'ff, circumdancei

ecutive direfloiv, will speedily furnifh an effeaual
relief, by restoring the natii>ns to that date of con

intereds, of both the republics. But in r< linquifh

his country ; we mud, in vain, attempt >0 calculate
the loss, and can derive confutation frorr. this reflec

palladium and pride of our lated posterity !
" Thus deprived in our public trar.fa&ions of the
benefit of those virtues and talents, that might well
inspire univtr sal confidence ; and of those aufpicet, |
which have hitherto given a propitious damp to the

every department of government, from every mem

Let us, then, gentlemen, by laws judiciously

important trust confided tÂ» us ; discountenancing, 1
at all times, aud by all means, the ungenerous aspe

of benevolence and haimony. By the observance
of a policy thus enlightened, you will confirm the
virlue and happiness Â«f your conflitaents, and raise
a lading monument of your own wisdom and patri

influence, in maintaining the rights and dignity of
the union. In a career so glorious, I shall chear
fully, though diffidently, accompany you with all
the powers of my office, and all the faculties of my
mindâenjoying the bed of all rewards, if, at the

FIRE AT NEW-YORK !
Letter from Nenv-Tork* yth December, 1796, to the
Editor.
e This morning at I o'clock, a fire broltt out on
c Murray's wharf, below the Coffee-Houfe, and con
j fumed the whole bloik of buildings from that Slip to
the F'y Ma-'ket, about 50 or 60 in number. The
b :i!ding3 coniifted of large warehnufes filled with
merchandize, and good houfes.âlt was one.of the
' richest blocks in the city. Much property is saved â
mora loft.âThe amount is incalculable. The princi
, pd fiifferers are Robert Bowne, John Murray, John
t Taylor, John Marfton, Stewart & Jones, Robinson &

David Wagltaff, Â£cc. &c.

r NEW THEATRE.
MACBETH.
The performance of this Play, last evening, contrary
[ *â¢ expedition, drew a full house. Many of the charafl.
crs ill the play were weakly oast, and the piece was, of
courft, not given with that strength we had been accus
tomed to fee in it. Some amends were, however, made,
r by the fpleiidor of the new dreflcs and decoration*, and
the fine performance of Cooper.
Commenciug his Thcat ic> 1 carrer in America, as he had
j done in England, with the chara&cr of Macbeth, the ul
timate ifluc will probably be very different- If Mr. Coo
per's Macbeth hag been thought, v orthy of cenfuri* in
FngUr.d, we fh*ll, wi-h all del deference to the London
Leviathans i/i Critique, tuke the liberty of forming an opi
, n,on wholly oppoiit*. Whrther this is to be at ributed
. rf> a decency of judgnKnt-in the. wrtfer of- these remarks
or rhe performer's advances in improvem nt in the in
terval, 1 know r.ot: th? general applause of a numerous
i au :it sice, is at once a ftrikinsj reinforcement of the latter
opinion, and forms a decided teftimony , to his merit,
Mr. Cooper had, however, attained the highest refpeifl
ability, previous, to his departure from Fngland.
In America, if Mr. Cooper be thought by some to l ave
been iurpafTed by that excellent performer, Fennell, his
I Macbeth jk opinion, entitles him at least to an equal
rank. TJp * in point of figure he will not bear a com
parison vritti that performer, yet the chaflenel's of his ac
tion and hi c com# gcfticulation, effaced any ideas of a de
ficiency to that refpeifc.
Mr. Corper's voice is clear and sonorous ; and though
he did not perhaps come up to Fennell in energy of tone
3!>d cocntcnance, he certainly pofleffrs in an eminent de
gree, all the flamina of a firft rate a&or.
The principal fpeechcs were given with nice difcrimina
ti?n and accuracy of judgment, above all at his death.
It appears not to have been a favorite cmHoiii with the
Immortal Bard, to put lengthy fpeechefl into the mouths of
his dying heroes. Wherever these occar *hcy are to be
traced to tlie hinds of moderÃ reformers. Nature and
' Â»Sh-.kefpeare ! bothfufifer from their labours.
" Time was tha;. whsn the breath was out,
" The rvmi would die.''
To make a man deliver a labored fpcech a quarter of an
t hour in length, after he is 'huYt even to death' is a palpa
ble abfurtiirr.
I| is a pity the Drama in America cannot lhake off the
trammel* on it by European prejudices and faJfe
1 idea*.
However in our recoJVflioÃ mny be the excellence
of ?,Trs. Whitlock, in LÂ»Â«.dy Macbeth, we arc Â®f opinion
ihat the applause beftowedon Mrs. Morris, in the flceping
scene, was richly merited Her taste and judgment, in
regard to her atrire, demand the palm of pre eminence.
Upon the whole, though we cannot be of opinion that
the characters of this ph.) were, generally, well yet
justice require the tribute of applauieto Mr. Cooper, in
Mr'.cbcth, for the eminent fati*fuÂ£lion afforded by h;s natu
ral performance of that arduous chara&er ; âto Mr. War*
ren ? in Banquo, for his chafteneGi and excellence and
to the Managers, for their liberal and expensive exertions in
brlngmg foi ward the tragedy in so elegant a flyle.
! Mr. Cooper n said to be a young gentleman of only 24:
His talents are uncommon fcr his years; and by having
judiciously marked out the line of nature for hispurfuit, he
bids fair to attain to the highell honors of his profeifion.
w -
Last evening, Mr. Cooper from CoM-nt Garden
Theatre, made his firft appearance in the chamber
of Macbeth. His figure is handsome and bit
countenance expfeflive and interellingâhe played
1 wi.h finfc difen'mination and great effect. During
the 2 fitft aftshe fecmed Jefvctive in energy, which,
perhaps was owing to the embarrassment of hi 6 situ
ation ; but his fubfequect scenes could not fail to
' rmprefs the public with a favorable idea of his ta
-1 lentj. There waÂ» no violent ranting or pompous
; dccjatmtion j hut he copied nature, and nature in
is fme to please : we wish, however, to fee
, Klin in two or three more charafttrs before we form
j yhj decisive judgment on his merits.
"j The farce of the Prize, was played with infinite
| huraytt by Mr. Harwood, Mr. Francis, and Mrs.
Oldmixenâthe latter sung her burlesque Italian air
with inimitable drollery.
We could wi(h the managers would obviate the
tedious delay that takes plat* between the aits ; it
is irksome to the and contributes in a
great msalure to, detaiÃ them to very unseasonable

CONGRESS
Are tÂ» assemble at Philadelftliia on Monday next.
We anticipate a fdfion less turbulent aud divided
than the latt. By this term, the political effervef.
occaConed by the treaty,.is abated ; and iren
naturally txpeft, that even the southern members
will be " fÂ»ber minded." Notwitliftanding the
vulgar plea of the youth of our couatry, it is now
fttfTicidiitly mature to sorter the arts. It is hieh
time for Amerieani to think less of foreign rela
tions, and more of her internal polity and improve.'
mcnt. The ufeful and the fine arts, have a claim
upon the attention of Congress } a claim, which is
paramount ta both the French and the Bririfh in
tcrelt. It is \ matter of the highest moment, that
works of public utiliry, and natiokal and dome/-
tic cescerns, fliould employ the statesman's care.
Genins, invejitiun, merit, are much more
confcquential than citiaen Ai'et ; and better is it to
cherifu o*e deserving American, than to pronounce
a fcofe of speeches, m ptaife of French magnani
