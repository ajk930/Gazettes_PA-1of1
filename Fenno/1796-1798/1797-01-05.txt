Were the degeneracy that marks many Jacobins

people they would be unfitted to maintain the inde

the arts of French agents, or enthufiaftieally se
duced by the visions of foreign theory, they attach
themselves to the French nation, the Americans
would as thoroughly violate their own sovereignty
as if they yielded by explicit contraa, their inde
pendence and their liberties, to the crown and do

the evil is equal whether he beholds the people of
America vanquilhed by the arms of England or
seduced into a furrenderof their rights by the sy

A Parallel to Captain Jtstup's Cafe.
The Brig William, Capt. Benjamin Henderfon,
belonged to Mr. William Gray, jun. of Salem,
Massachusetts. Oil a voyage frem Point-a-Petre,
she was Raptured by the privateer Prince William
Henry, and carried to St. Kitts, where some French
property she had on board was taken out and con
demned. After her departure from St. Kitts, (he
was met with on the 19th Odobcr, 1793, by l ' )e
French privateer Citizen GeÂ»et, which l)ad left
Philadelphia ten days before. The privateer obli
ged capt. Henderfon to hoist out his boat and bring
his papers on board, which being done, he was ask
ed te whom the French sugar on board belonged ?
He replied, to William Gray of Salemâupon
which the person who aflted the question, and who.
he underftnod was the French captain, cajled him
a damned tynr and walking forward spoke to the
men: five sailors immediately advanced, tookcapt.
Henderfon by the collar, dragged him to one <*f
the guns, where they held him, cut his trowfers
behind, and beat him with 20 lashes on the bare
flefh, until he was black and blue. On expoflulat
ing 011 this cxtraerdinaiy treatment of a neutral
veflel, he Was told, that the /Imerieant tvere a parcel
of damned rafcah, and did not deserve better treat
ment. On captain Henderfon being dismissed, fix
French sailors were fem with him on board the
William : these immediately fell to ransacking the
vessel, and plundered from her in cash arid goods to
the amount of atout 3501. Before (he was dismis
sed, however, four Bermudian sailors, who were
prisoners on board the privateer, were put on board
her, altho' -capt. Henderfon 'urged, that he had
scarcely previfians enough for his own crew : the
consequence was, that captain Henderfon was uh
,der the necefllty of retrenching the allowance of all
the (hip s company, himfelf included.
The foregoing is presented to the public as an
accurate (latement : the occurrence is knows to
mjny : and Mr Gray is now in poifeflion of au
thentic proofs te support it.
We fee advert, Ted an " Euhginm Intendedtoper

Mr. Fenno,
I have persuaded a friead of mine to reduce to
writing, a summary of his observations, in a large
company, (where they were well approved) on the
present posture of affairs in regard to France,
While 1 request you to publilh them, 1 cannot bui
hope they will be copied into all the papers of the
United States..
Vour's,
IT is good sport to fee how .the democrats are
puzzled to get along with the affair of citizen
Adet. He affects to thrtaten the government, and
loax th.e people. But a downright, plain-dealing,
let of country folks do net understand this distinc
tion. VlÂ» hen men thinic they are threatened, if
they are cowards, they sneak off j or if they can
not da so, they bow very law, beg pardon very
humbly of Monsieur, for the affront he hai oJtreJ
ih.m. Here is one chcek, citizenâ ftn'ke that firfl,
ini then wÂ« will turn the other. This is the fpirit
td language of the Aurora ; and no doubt if the
patriotic I'ell s Point regiment, that drew up to
receive citizen Barney at Baltimore, (hould pre
sent to him an address, they will fill it with the
cfcoicell phrases, about the honour and inJ,Â£tndtnci \
of the country.
A CUSTOMER.
But, alai! theft* palrv.ts "ft scarce. ThÂ« pco
pie generally feci another fort of spirit, and the
Aurora tries to intimidate that spirit by the system
of terror. The terrible republic speaks through
theAuroia, (to use the bombalt of in generals)
thunder \ The country is warned of its danger,
while Adet's manifcfto assures us there is no dan
gar at allâbegs us to think so ; that his nation
loves our peopleâhas no thoughts of war ; ami
cries as if his gentle heart would break. Yet,
while these crocodile tears are still trickling down
the faees of those iron hearted democrats, who cri
ed, Vive? la Guillotine ! Vive la Mort ! and trod
on bleeding victims, without any tears at all, they
tell u> in the fame breathâ-war, war with France,
This double plot spoils the Comedy. It is such a
jumble of love and muider, that they ar,e sure to
be hifled off the fta'ge : and so they will be; fer
the farce railed the Blunderbuss, or Notei, is al
ready dam.ied. '
War is in nobody's noddle. France will not
wago war with us (and there Adet is to be believ
ed) uiilefs wc Itiuggle harder than we have yet
done, to prevent her from thrusting her fraternifing
fingers any more into the pockets of our merchants
Six or eight millions are already jjently taken by
the French privateerfmcn, no doubt with tears in
their eyes, Yet, no war. If France flieuld take
as much more, (he and hÂ»r minirter might shed
tears ; but why shed our blood, if we it in
future as well as *ell as we have done ? It is a catife
of war, there is no question, to seize our (hips
contrary te treaty ; and that (he has done all along,
before the British treaty, as well as since : for
that treaty has only furnifhed a new pretext for an
old piecc of rapine and perfidy.
In one word of very plain English, for the times
dfmand itâwe may be sure ef peacc with France,
if we will let her plunder our vi-fTcls. She has given
us cause of war ; but if we wave the affront and
injury, and keep peace, will (he go o war with us
beetle we allow her (as flic fays we do the Bri
tish) to capture our vefTels ?
Our democrats, not content with this, go on to
found alarms; but they dm uld remember the fort
of folks they have to deal with. It is too late to
address the fears, er to whine ioft love nonsense to
Americans, after having oncc roused them by
threats and insults.
France, lay the democrats, is more terrible than
ever, since her conquefis in Germany and Italy
Terror, the reader will observe, is in every Sen
tence of the Aurora. Now, France is less terrible
since those cenqnelh ; for (he has exasperated the
conquered people : her anarchical principles are
now 00' more a currency any where out as France,
(and perhaps nÂ»t within it) than the afiignats. If
reveries (hould attend Buonaparte, likethufe which
have befallen the two other armies, fury wwuld suc
ceed to the despair of the Italians. They would
rife as the peasants have done in Germany. Can
they march â¢ again into G.r marty, and fnpply an.
other year's war by plundering an enemy's coun
try a second time ? If they (hould, they would
get less : the after crop of conquclt is scanty. Be
tides, the people become all soldiers, and it is al
mofl inconceivable that a second irruption into
Germany (hould be fuccefsful. The war then is to
be nourished by other means than &h enemy's coun
try can furnifh. What are they ?
Paper money (lops. A French funding system
to borrow, perhaps. Would our democrats recom
meÂ»d that ! Will taxes answer to fach an amount
as the next campaign will call for ? The revenue of.
the old Roman empire for ten years would not Sup
ply it. Will the French renew the system of ter
ror, and coin all private property into cafli for the
purchafeof gunpowder, soldiers' hats and (hoes ?
Thus, if France holds out terrors to us, fhchas
enough of them at home. Her prol'pe<ft is now
vkorc terrible than her threats. It is not pretended
that (he will be or can be conquered ; but (he has
difficulties to overcome, to provide for another
campaign, which it is believed will Hop her eon
quelis, though they will not endanger htr indepen
dence. She hat het terrible hafids full ; am j f 0
have England and Amlrta : but they will fight
hard rather than lufe their independence, which
France avows her design utterly to subvert. Delcn.
da eft Carthago, is forever her menace to England:
No one will be surprised if the Democrats deny
all this, and'blulter as usual about the million and
an half French conquerorsâAnswer,, So much the
harder will it be to pay them, if there are so many,
and elpecially, if the conquerors should be driven
back into France tc be fed and paid at home, in
stead of being noufijhed, as the Diieftory term it,
by viÃtry.
Should the Democrats rejoin, the flavet of kings
will yej flock to the liberty cap of France and join
htr, like true patriate, against their owe country
it is replied. This fort of patriotism so praised in
the Aurora, and so relied or by the sons of terror
btre, is now quite gene from Gtimany and Italy
It is whether any of it it left in the
world, except some of the worit sf its dregg at
Fell's point, Baltimore.
For, whatever the origin or real motives of the
war might have beeir, Fiance invodet now, and her
enemies defend themfel> eÂ». That is clear, and a
war of felt-defence will force her enemies and with
the hearty concurrence too of their fubjeds, to
malie every possible effort. Let {he Democrats
prattle about (he French compelling viSory to return
to their Jandard, this campaign has eflcntially
changed the position of the powersr at war, as well
as the ptinciplet of the contest, and the fenfy of
mankind uponthem. Eventt may difyppointtheraoll
reafonablc conjectures. This is admitted, and it
is possible, though not probable, the French may
despoil new region* in another campaign. But as
the Direflery know that if new regioiy exist, rich
in fptil, it wilt be difficult to get at them, they
matt aft towards us on pruoabilitiet. With so ma
ny emharrafTments, and discouragements too, the
argument is a fair one, and we rely on it accord
ingly, they will not nkke a new enemy, especially
one that has been Ung plundered without becom
ing their /enemy, and so there it no need to make
the enemy to afford the plunder, at a plundered
friend is fafer and just at good.
But at fame hypochondriac perfont may Aill |i e
awake anigfettwith their fjars of Freach anger.
it Is proper after having fp?n thÂ» beclonded prof
peft of France to look at the effect an Amtricaa
war wotilc have to mend it.
It is, 1 trust, needless to watn the reader againfl
the notion that the friends of our insulted govern
ment wish or apprehend a war with Frame. They
do not. They aft differently frum the Democrati
in this refpeft. A kind Â«f bullying war with Bri.
tain and no treaty was all theii cry in 1794. The
Federalists said then, and fay now, avoid war but.
negociate, prepare and afl with spirit. The want
of spirit in the Democratic (file was at manifeft
then as now. For then they refufed all really
ft rot g measuresâno mÂ»rt revenue nor force, no
treaty. In one word, a war upon Sritifh debt*
was alt they alked for. Having mentioned this tÂ»
prevent Democratic mifreprefen ation, the reader
will just proceed to turn his thungbts to the true
and experienced cons qacnefs to Francc of our
being engaged in a war with her.
In former wars, her tftands were in extremity of
want in consequence ol our supplies being flopped
and thsfe from France in a" great meafu>e also.
Then, howevei, we weie weak compared wilhour
present means. Then France was ttrong at fta com
pared with her present naval weakness, which is
such as never was known hefore. Her iflandi
woald be mote cxpofed than ever. And though
France has few, or no merchant (hips, the immense
exports of her colenies would be a prty that couid
not escape. At present, our veflels cover those
exports in a great degree from capture by the Bri.
tifh. If Spain should also Uecome our enemy,
American privateeis would cover the seas. We
have no navy, but we rank very high among the
fca-faiing nations of the eaith ; nor is it mere spe
culation that we (houid be immediately formidable
as a uaval power. In the wat-with Britain,
trade was so strongly prote&ed hy hei immenie na
vy, near two thousand fail of prizes were taken, by
the armed vefTels of one of the eaflern states. Brief
ly but soberly wc fay, France could not maintain
her colonies againfi all her enemies, if we ihould
be forced to be of the number. '
No man' of sense and experience will deny this
position after due refledlion upon the facts and piin
ciples that it rests upon.
Why then, perhaps the Democrat will retort,
were ybu government so unvyilling ta fight
England ? A force fu powerful its you reprefenc
out privateers would huml<le England. Answer,
privateers afford us the power to annoy others,
but they coyld not prevent our trade, now so im
mense from being annoyed and perhaps tuined.â
It is a power to hurt others, not to enrich ourfelvei
*39 all privateering experience has d,
The fuperierity. ot Britain enables her to defend
her tiacie, and to crush that of the United States
beyond any other enemy we might quarrel with,
tho' Ihe would fufFer grievously. Moieover peace
â¢with all nations is the doftrtne of the federal friends
of the government When uccafions ol war arise,
let us remove them by treaty if we canr In this
they have been uniform and confident; and fucccfs
has orown'd their willies ; the republic baÂ» appro
ved them, and enjoy 3 the prosperity which has re
sulted from tliem.
The argument might be parfnrd much farther
to shew that France is not in a situation to make
a war with usdefirable to herfelf. And if success
should again attend her armies and lead her rashly
to begin it, the means of'the tjised States aie
ample anj] sure to bring her to repentance. Our
trade mjght fuffer, but (he would run the risk of
losing her foreign pofleffions forevet.
Thefc obfervatiqns, if admitted to be just, are
certainly seasonable, as the Aurora daily renews
the attempt to deceive, and to degrade our coun
try by filly alarms and cowardly Mia-fUtementt
its exposed and helpless situation. .
Mr. Fenno,
As the queflion concerning a land tax or a. poll tax
is becoming the futij -il of general conversation, per
haps the inclosed obiu'vations may not he thought im
proper by some of your readers. They are extraded
from a letter that was publilhedini7B9,in a neighbour*
lag Hate.
Of TAXES.
In all governments the relief of the poor ihould be
one ot the chief qbjeAs of legislative attention.
Every citizen demands justice and\ prote&ion From
government, these fliould not, they cannot be reftifed,
but the poor man has other claims ; bis wants and
his fitfterings mult be in proportion to his poverty;
humanity requires that his fufiferings. be relieved or
prevented. 1 hough the rich are not to. be defrauded
tor the lake of the poor, the laws iu every state Ihould
be so framed as to encourage and allift the poor ia
their usual employments. Thenecefiary burdens of
civil go en.ment (hould be so faihioned as to press en
their (houlders, in the not convenient and easy man
ner. The general payment of taxes is necefiary to the
lupport of government, bat the payment of taxes in
many cases is difficult, in ftmt cases iriapradlicable by
the poor man, without the file of his property by
a public officer. Every misfortune of this kind Ihould
be prevented if possible. Perhaps tke molt efTcdual
mode of preventing the poor mil from being diftreJT
ed in the payment of taxes, is by substituting an excifc
1 j j property. In France,
England and Holland,, the expenees of governmtat
are chjefty raised by an excifc. It has been frequent
y laid that when a luhjedV orcitizen is obliged te.coit*
raw T r,Â»i ei j ai ff ' um tor th ' utc of gÂ° Ter Â«'"fnt there
can be little difference by what name the tax it called,
or ow it is laid. Nopoftioa canbe more fallackraf,
A-land tax or a poll tax are inevitable and pofitWe
they cannot be averted j the iaduftrious can,
not elude them ; the unfortunate cannot eftape theÃU

mÂ«qnt, or his little furniture mutt be fold. The ex.

laid on luxuries no prudent man will pay much of it.

â lht e *Â« f e operates as a relief to the unfortu
nate, for on fich years they buy ao luxuries. Let
us iuppofe a poll tax or a land tax of five dollars only:
may it not happen that at the season for colledKng tax

rorefight are not cl.ara&eriftics of the poor ; on-the
eontrarjr, f ew men in the United States are poor, ua>
* 'liey are remarkably deficient in ikofe qualities,
TRUE CLUEWhy then flioulc our laws fnppofe the citizen to
have the quality that he certainly has not ? Why shall
they make it neceflary for him to be treasuring mo
ney for months, who never cared for to morrow ?
Ihe mod indolent or the most carelcfs citizen cannot
possibly be incommoded by an excise ; If he {hould
have no money during the year nor any thing to fell,
he will buy nothing, and consequently will no tax.
When he is able to buy foreign commodities W will
pay his tax. The excise is fuppofqd chiefly to fall up
on articles of foreign make, and prudence will diredt
that articles which are lead neceflary and such as may
/Â©oneft come to perfection in our own country, ftnll
bear the greatest (hare in the excise. The natural ope
ration of such taxes is favourable to the poor. No
man pays the tax who is not able and willing to buy
luxuries or foreign articles, therefore it is volun ary.
The man who is diligent has less occasion for such ar
ticles, therefore it is a spur to mduftry. In a word,
all taxes on property are bur ens on the good citizen ;
they difcourageinduftry. All raxes on consumption are
taxes on difiipation and luxury; they puniih ldlenefs,
and promote industry. Can we hefitatein making our
choice ?
The revenue of the Roman empire, in its prosper
ous days, arose chiefly from an an excise and customs.
That jealous and wife nation did not readily submit to
a land tax. There was a wafteful trade carried on be
tween Rome and the East Indies by way of the red
sea. By that trade much fijver, near four millions of
dollars, was annually exported from the Empire, and
we have reason to conclude from the allegations of
Pliny, chat East India goods were'forced to contribute,
by an excise more than twenty millions per annum to
the revenue. A land tax and poll tax were in early
use through the Roman provinces, but do not ap
pear to have been generally imposed on the Roman
people before the reign of Galenius,the fucccftbr of Di
oclefian. I'rora that period dire<ft taxes became uni
â¼erfal. What was the condition of the Roman peo
ple under an administration of customs,âexcise and
other indire<sVtaxes, when compared with the times in
which the land tax and poll tax became'general ? It
was an age of gold, compared to that of iron Hu
manity is Ihocked by the tales of woe that are told con
cerning rhe poor of that age. Parents are said have
fold tfeeir children and to have fold themselves into
slavery, in order to Ihun the burden of taxes.
I have laid that an excise is more favourable to the
poer than a laniLor poll tax ; I will venture an addition
al sentiment. There never was any government in
which aaexcife could be offo much life as in the Uni
ted States of America, fn all other countries taxes of
every fort are j, species of grievance. [11 the United
States an cxcife on foreign joods would not be a griev
ance ; like wholesome flood if wouid give us strength.
It woald help to close that wafteful drain by which o::r
honour and our wealth are consumed. What tho'
we did not owre a florin to any foreign nation ; though
we had no domestic debt and though the txpences qf
government could be supported for many years without
taxes, (till it may be quelfioned. whether ail excise on
foreign articles wouM not be prudent. It is the bell
expedient bv which we ean promote domestic manu
factures and the condition in which we now liveâour
general dependence ob foreign countries for arms and
tloathing is. dilhonourable, âit is dangerous.
CONGRESS OF the UNITED STATES.
HOUSE OF REPRESSfWATITE3.
Thirfday, December 29.
The house resolved itfelf into a committee of the
whole, Mr. Muhleaberg in the cbait, on the report
â¢f the committee of commerce and manufa&HieS',
on the subject of kidnapping negroes and mulat
toei.
This report was greun !ed on an application from
the Hate of Delaware, for some provilioii tu pic-
Tent the carrying off from that (late free negroes
and mulattoes, by matters of veflels to other Hates.
The report to cure this evil, provides that every
matter of a reffel Should have certificates with such
negroes.and muiattoes of thciV being free. No ef
fe&uai regulation, it was dated, could be made Â»n
this fuhjett by the individua! tlatcs, as their jtirif.
diiftion did not extend beyond their territorial li
mits. Some members contended, thai the laws of
the individual Hates were fufficient to provid.- a
gainst the e*il. The report was oppiifed as iicom
plete, and the fubjeft was fpokc-i of as of too de
licate a nature to engage the attention of thelioufe,
88 it bore an affinity to thefubjeflof emancipation.
To this latter idea it waV Well aniwered, thattht
qaeftioo was by no means about emancipating flares,
but whether prsvtfions (hould not be enacted to
prevent freemen from being made fl.ives, because
they wcte black.
The committee rose without coming to a decifi
bn, and the Teport was recommitl-ed 46 to 30,
with liberty to the committee of commerce and
manufatflures to report by Other wife.-
The house went into committee of the whole on
the report of the secretary at war, on the petition of
Hugh Lawfon White.
This petition will try the principle, whether the
(ni)itia which were called out under gen. Sevier, in
'g 3, toad again ft the Indian*, are entitled to com
pensation.
The report (latÂ«s, that the expedition waÂ» un
dertaken withsut authority frem the gcnetal go
vernment and for the avowed purpose of carrying
the war into the Cherokee country ; that the in
ftru&ions frÂ»m the war department forbid offenfive
eperations. That-, however, it appears that pre
vious to the expedition the inhabitants of Tenncf
/ee were much harraffed by the Indians, who had
billed at (wo Itations, one within 7 miles of the
capital, 15 persons, and that it mult reft withcon
grefs to fay whether tbe circumstances of the cafe
â warranted the expeditioa as a just and necefTary
inelfure.
i In the cotirfe of the debate it was denied, that
he expedition had been undertaken for the avowed
pnrpofe of carrying the wai into the Cherokee
country : and (tated, in addition to the circum
stances nriestioned in the repart, that 1200 Indi
ans before the expedition carried a Ration and threat
ened to attack Knoxville.
Mr. A. Jackson moved the following resolution.
" Resolved that General Sevier's expedition in
to the Cherokee country in the year 1793, was a
just and neceflary measure, and that provilion ought
to be made by law for paying the expencei there
of."
The committee rose without coming to a decifi
on and had leave to fit again.
A communication was received from the secreta
ry of the trcafwry on the fubjedt of the loan fur
ihp nfe of the cfty of ColuiubWy which was rear!
Â»nd ordered to bc.priuted.
Tt was resolved on account of tlie fiiortnefs of
the feflijn, 40 to 30, not to take up the Bankrupt
bill.
The following resolution was moved and ordered
to lie on the' table.
" Resolved that a Committee be appointed to en
quire if any and what alterations are in
the a& entitled " an a& refpe&iag fugitives from
justice, and peffons escaping from their mailers."
Adjourned.
Friday, December 30.
Mr. Dwight Fofler, from the committee of
claims, made report on Â»he petitions of Andrew
Ramfey, and Nathan Smith, recommending; a non
camp,iance with the prayer ot the petitioners. The
house concurred.
Mr. Freeman prefentcd a petition from John
! Marflon and others, graying fÂ«>r the payment of
i-certain Sills of credit iflTut*<l by ihe United States
in March 1780, of which they are holders. Re
ferred to the com n't tee of claims.
Mr Gilbert preferred a petition from Lewis H.
Girlam, of New York, praying for a remission of
du'ies on certain wines destroyed by the late f!re.
Referred to the committee of commerce and manu-
factures,
M>. A. Jackson prefentcd a petition from
George Ciltert, one of the chiefs of the Chicka
saw Nation, cwmplarrtng- of a non-performance of
stipulations, entered into in certain Talks held with,
the. agents of the United States, in which they
were promised afiiftance in cafe they were attacked
by the red people, and praying fu payment on ac
count qf the maintenance of a Colonel and 46 men
for 60 days, who had marched to the'ir afiiftance
when attacked by the Creeks, without orders from
government Referred to-ihe committee of claims.
The house, on motion, again refolded itfelf into
a. committee of the whole on the report of'the fe
jretary of war on the' petition of Hugh L-iwfon
White, and, after corlidcrahlf difctiffion, on the
f uggt flion that farther information was necessary to
be obtained before a decifiou was come to, the
committee rof<?, was refund leave tÂ» lit again,and
the report and papers accompanying Â«*, Were refer

" You will no doubt feel both pity and indigna
tion, when you are i|ifo-med that that Charles
Pinckney is ele&ed our Governor. Ab soon 33
he uai (worn into office, he began his speech by
m.ikin â  a most indecent attack on the perfoiis who
did not vote for him (confuting of 53 of the most
respectable perions-iu the country) and like
wise upon the measures of the federal govern
ment. HÂ» is too cunning to have liis speech
printed, as he delivered it, but his firft nbfer
vation was, he was happy to find, as was
proved hy his ele&ion, the tiitimph of republican
principles (rifum'teneatis f) He then contrasted
I the prefept (ituation of the country with its fitua
tioo when he was formerly Governor. He said,
that we were an ungratefwl and degraded peopleâ
(one would think so from his being eledted Goner
nor) âthat we had behaved most infamously to
our allies, the French ; "Who, .we itOPED, WOULD
SOON BRING US TO A SENSE OF OUR POLITICAL
errors." These last words were taken down. It
was, in (hort, a mojl abominable performance, an.l
with the exception or his creatures, was reprobat
ed by men of both parties. It is thought here,
Jelfe-i son's ele&ion to the Presidency is certain ;
;;nd owr new Governor, who lias been long feekins;
for a foreign appointment, thinks this jacobin
speech will be a charming recommendation of him
to Jefferfon's good graces : so that if he is Prili
â¢lent, you may judge of what you are to expert
front the French party."
NEIV THEATRE.
On Monday the Tragedy of Richard
llhl.
Mr. Warren gave great feeling the f harafter of
Henry 6th.
Mr. Fox told his tearful tale is Treflel, with a
pathos quite in chara&er. This young gen'lenian,
when he has added a little experience and ftndy
to his performance ( which has already merited great
praise) will nndaubtedlv be an ornament to the
Theatre.
Mr. Cooper's maflerly perfonification of Rich
ard, was received with that applause that generally
attends his'public exhibitions. He gave the link
ing traits ot the charaÂ£ier with an energetic bold
ness, and fire, .that attends only the performance
of native genius, and without which art can do iit
ile. He gave great farce to the folilnquy of
" Why, now ray golden dream is out."
And indeed all of Them were malterly expressed.
Mrs. Francis was corredl and fpitited in the cha
racter ot* .Lady Anne, but was certainly deficient
h pathos awd exprrfikm. In the tent scene, she
was particularly faulty, and spoke,
" ) hink on the wrongs of wretched Anne thy wife
" E'en in the battles heat remember me.
" And edgelel's fall thy swordâdespair anddie."
With the faiAe tone as (he did,
' But since you teaeh me how to flatter you
" Imagine I have said farewell already."
The address in the chat after of the Ghojl would
have (hac. it been properly exprefled ) produced
great effedt. However by what we havÂ» said it
niufl not be thought, that we intend to rob her of
all praiseâher performance often merits itâand in
spite of the dsfi;fls we have noticed, (he certainly
is entitled tÂ«< a (hare of otir approbation.
Mrs. L'Eftrange was but' ill calculated to tx
prefs the torrowsof the dutchcfs of York, tjie mo
notony of her voice could not convey that spirit
that Shakcfpcare intended (hould be given to her
exccration of Richard. W. L.

Caution.
WHEREAS very hrge and heavy debts ire juftty
due and owing from mefirj. Blair M'Clehacbah and
Patiick Moore, of the city of Philadelphia, merchants,
trading under the firm of Blair M'Ultnachan ar.cl P.
Moore, and from Blair M'Clenacban in his ftfparate
capacity ; to which, by the laws'of the land, all the
joint ai well as separate property of the said Gentle
men, is, and ought to be, liable. And whereas
it is clearly and fatisfaftorily ascertained, thai mr.
Blair M'Cltnachan, of the said firm, has conveyed
away to mr. John U. HuJlon, his son-in-law, to his
daughter, miss NFClcnachan, and to his son. George
M'Clenachatt, several large and valuable real estates,
as well as considerable personal property, in the ,city
and county of Philadelphia, in the county of Lancas
ter, in the count* of New-Castle on Delaware, and
elsewhere, with a view, as it is apprehended, to de
feat the Creditors in the recovery of thtir just debts. â
This is, therefore, to forewarn all persons wbamlb
ever, againlt the purchase from the laid grantees, or
either ef jtltcm, of any portion of the said real or per
foiial property, as the moll vigorous measures will
without delay be taken to render the fame liable to
thejutt demands of the Creditors.
By order of the Creditors.

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public prints,
warning all perfont againlt purchafiug from the
granteesof Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and petfonal estates lie conveyed away to
his fon-in law and to hie eliildren was the result of
a deliberation had upon the fubjeft by a general and
ntimer'oas meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clenn
chan individually. It was no more than an execu-_
tion of that trust confidevd in the fufrfcribers by
those creditors: a step which it would have been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitte'l.
The very ftatcment of the fait therefore mult dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or viodidtive.'' It originated in a deGre to l'ecure
the property of the debtor as a fund fer the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fanftioned by the
advice of council as a measure to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advertisement haj been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he ovtti that iajury
to his own unjuftitiable conduit, net to the sub
scribers who have merely publifhad the truth in
terms as mild as the fait would admit, and who
mean to invefligate in a high court of justice the
validity of thole purchases of M'Cle
nachnn to confidently speaks.
The subscribers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
eantion against purohafjng of those graatees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it ts a
purchase from any other persons (if such there be)
to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
conveyances.

""PHE dwelling house is built of ftotje, two stories high,
x gemedy fimlhed, and contains four handsome rooms on
a floor, besides an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
cellars It is generally thought to command the motta
grceable profpeft of the Delaware, from the foutce of that
livei to the Capes. This profpeft ia greatly einb'cllifhed by
a full view of a vast body of meadow, through which, the
Chrilfiana and Brandywine creeks are scan winding 1,1 beau
