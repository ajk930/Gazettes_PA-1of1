Mr. Otis Taid, that th: objiflif>na made

ought to be allowed, to cmfure men and
jnrafur; i, and such popular topics ; but he
did not sorestÂ« tny objefHoo arifuig from the
copliitutie.n.
"lid not think it required much time
or j'ailitv, ho ever, to aiifwer to the ob
'ii3 produced on this occafiÂ»n by the

ft had been f iid, Congress wis reftr'fted
from the life of this power by the Â£ i) f. iftion
of the lit article th:. Conllitnt on, winch
provide* lhat the migratim or importation
of such persons as the States (hniid thistk
pmptr to admit (hould not be prohibited prior
u>lÃoÃ. It this ctauie in iis moll rigid
coulbuction amounted to a prohibition to
the National Government with refpetl to the
bam'lhmeut of aliens, in all iafes where the
separate States had thought . rop r to admit
them ; it should ltill.be (hewn tliat individual
States had Cver thought pro tr to adtnit
Aliens ol tfic description mentioned in this
bill. He btjuved uo state bud palfeu laws
dedcring it lobe tlteir intention to admit
fugitives from jullice and seditious persons
inro their territory. It is true, that fomt
of (he States may have tol. rated the admiffi
oool luih persons by forbearing tocuaft laws
â¢agaiiift them ; but their silence on this fubjctl
can neve beconfideredas evidence of their as
sent to the eriiigrati ;ii of liicii characters.
Tie article of the Co â  dilution alluded to
as he underltood it, had an evident reference
to a species of f reigntrs held as property hi
some of the Slates wh fe- importation are
fondtioned by their laws. He meant slaves.
Tlieobj<ct was tÂ» prevent any interference
of the General Government with the State
Qovernraents in the sdmifTion of these per
fotw bef retli* year 18s8 This conltruc
*ioo appeai* very material, becaule in all
tbofe S>t tes where this property is field,
they have th'irown laws for regulating their
adtn ffion and importation, but in no lUte
did laws exilt regulating the migration of
any other Aliens.
sut the gentleman from rÂ«ni>fylvani* fays,
that after th; ( onftitution had been adopted
by nine i f the States, the old Congress re
commended to the several States to take
meafdfes against the intr duction of male
feiturs from foreign countries, and from
hence he infers ti at this right did not be
long to the old Congress and in their elli
mation was not delegated to the Federal
Government. The faft is, that although
the Constitution was adopted yet as the le.
giflatnre had not then met, it was net in
.operation, and the old Congress, perceiving
â¢dangers arising from this source, might as
wtil reconuMend to thr dates to provide a
gai .ft them, as againll any 01 her dangers.â
buppof?, before the Congress had met, mo
tley had betn wan ing, and the States had
been applied to for it, would it afte> wards
have been said that the requisition of theoid
Congress ifier the Conft.tutien had been
ratified was evidence of their opinion, that
the Legislature of the Union under the r.ew
Government, had uo authority to raise mo
ney ! He pre fumed that it was forefeen by
tlie old Congress that the attention of the
Legiflsluve under -the new Government
would of DectfSty be occupied upon fubjefts
of a m< re momentous nature, for some time,
and the recommendation was wife in itfelf,
and by no means ctinclufive against the au
thority now, claimed by this bill.
But it was (aid, that to pass this bill
would be to fufpeod the Habers Corpus.â
He denied.this. Evei y Aliea resident, when
apprehended, woutd be at liberty to apply
to a judge son a writ of Habeas Corpus.â
The return of the warrant w; uld (hew that
he had boea legally apprehended as a pcrfon
dangerous to the peace of the United Stales
and under their authority, and he would be
<vf cnurle recommitted. But it appeared to
him an absurd supposition, that Congress
lias not the power to restrain and to baiiilh
jserfont who may have been sent iiÂ»o this
country for the very purpose of spreading
sedition and of dividing tie people, whose
intrigues and malpractices threaten the wel
fare and the very exilltnce of the govern
ment. If the Conftttu-ion prevented Con
gress from ixerciling these powers would
such a Constitution be worth a farthing ?
It certainly would not ; lince ihe power of
feruling nil this description of peifons," is ef
fcnlial not only to the promotion of the
|rÂ»b ic welfare by preferviag peace, but to
tlvs efficieut prolecution of a war.
But he wished to know why the fe&ion
â¢f the Constitution alluded 10 according to
the couiliuÂ£tion of gent'iemen might n< t as
well rellcain Cocgrds from taking measures
againll the migration of a French Army, as
uphill the landing of other Aliens ; for he
no power giveii to Congress by the cen
llituuoi' to prevent the migration ol a Fo
reign Army into this country. Vet
tUre is no tapref? authority to this Â«(Ted,
it is one of these things, which iÂ» too evi.
Jent to be doubted, and an Â«rmy of soldiers
would not be so ila igtrous to the country,
as an army i f spies and incenejiaries scat-
Kred through the continent.
By John Fenno, N 8 119 Chefmit > Street
PHILADELPHIA: THURSDAY EVENING, JULY 12, 1798.
He thought the whole question resolved
itfelf into this enquiry ; has Congress the
power to provide for the common detence
a'.d welfare of the country ? AÂ«d if so, do
we deem it essential to this end, that the
propof d powtv (hould be given to the Pre
(ident, or to some other Departmentof Go
vernment ? He thought it was, and if there
be any thing in the letter of the Constitution
whi h would appear to bear a differe .t con
ftruftion (which he detiied) it ou lit to be
recoi.cded to other clauf.s and po *rs which
impose the sacred and fupet ior duty of pro
viding for the fafe;y ,oi ihe country, a-id
without which all our efforts against our
enemy will prove vain and futile. In this
cafe there was not a (hadow of difficulty.â
Aliens may come hither under the laws of
the States, and when they become dange
rous thi-y may be expelled by the laws of
the Union.
It remained for gentlemen to consider
whether we have any dang;r to apprehend
from thi3 source, or not. Whether the
French reigM not employ other pe' fonsthan
their own citiaens to carry on their nefarious
purposes in this country ? In his humble
opiqun, there is greater daoger from this
f urce than from any other. He elieved it
li>d ecu owing to this lhat all the
repacks in Europe have bi;en laipriftrate
in the dnll ; it is thin fyftetu which has ena
bled tie French to overleap all natural pnd ani
ficial obftrnclions ; t fuhjuoate Holland and
Italy, to destroy the Helvetic confederacy
and force a passage through rocks and mo.U' -
tains which have been for ages acred to jhe
defen;e of liberty ; it is this system which
has watered the tomb of William Tell with
the blood of widows lighting over their
slaughtered hufoands and with the tears of
orphans who survive to swell the proceflion
of t'ie viiftors.
Mr. O. notwithstanding believed that
there are Aliens in t i.is country who would
never be affeÂ£Ud by hi: law and that there
were among us even natives of France,
whose merit and misfortunes gavq a claim .to
protection and who would prove good citi
zens ; and he was willing to make the moll
ample provision for the security of the pro
perty of both' Alien enemies and Alien
friends. But while he refpeQe the rights
of the individual and disdained to retaliate
upon private property, he could not, with
the dreadlul examples ofother countries be.
fore his eyes, ou.it the molt necefTa y pre
cautions against the mod inftart danger.â
In the late situation Â»f those cowries ard of
his own country, he could trac. some pain
ful analogies If we knew ourselves to be a
chosen people, if the age of miraclea (hould
return aud omnipotence (hould fpiak to us'
by the mouths of h s holy prophets, neither [
miracles or prophecy would llrike home to ;
his mind a deeper conviSio.i than he now i
felt, that in the faie of the European Re- j
pub ics we might read our own, unless all I
the prudence and energies of our country j
were fuoimoned to avert it. They boasted 1
of their patriotism and courage, they talked
loudl/of defence, and xif refilling the inva
der ; of their attachment to their govern
ment, and of their preference of death to
submission. Vet when the hour of trial ar
rived, it appeared that secret corruption and
foreign influence had completed their work j
upon the flighted shock those repuhlicks
crumbled into fragments, and the good aiid
the honcft citizens were left to (tare with
(lupid wonderÂ«t theeale with which foreign
agents and domestic traitors vaulted into
place and power. It is needless to fatigue
the committee with these recitals.âNot to
fee their application is to be blinded with' a
flood of light âNot to believe in their moral
was grufs and fatal infidelity. He hoped the
.objeiilion would be renounced and that the
bill would pass.
Mr. R. Williams said, that although
there might, in his opinion, be many objecti
ons against the palling of a bill of this kind,
and though he believed it would be consis
tent wi.th.tbe rules of the floufe to shew tliat
impolicy, to induce the committee to ftrikc
out the firft feflion, he (hould confine himlelf
to the conftitutioiwl question.
If the principle which the gentlemen from
Mallachufetts have drawn from the preamble
of the constitution, of providing for the com
mon detence and welfare of the Union, be cor
real, it appeared to him iinnecedary to have
any other provilion in the constitution besides
the preamble, as it may be inferred from that,
that Congress has all power whatever. If
such a conftruclion be allowed, what becomes
of the powers of the state governments ? This
preamble of the copftitution would fwajlow
up the whole.
Mr. W. conceived gentlemen erred in the
very commencement of their arguments, in
not considering how the general government
had,grownout of the state governments, and
from the people. For it is clear, if they had
thus coniidered the matter, they niuft have
seen that this government can have noothe
rower than what is given to it from the state
governments, and by the people, in the con
stitution. Mr. W. would agree, that if the
general government were to be considered as
poftelling all power, and the state govern
ments and people as poffelling none, then
the arguments of gentlemen would applyâ
but he believed this was a ground that no
gentleman could maintain, it niuft be ac
knowledged that the state governments retain
to thenifelves certain powers, and that the
people also rera u certain other powers, which
they have neither delegated to the (late nor
general government; and far the latter to at
tempt to exercise any power which has not'
been given to it by the constitution, is of
courfc a violation of the constitution.
Thegentleman from Maflachufettsfirft up
(Mr. Scwall) grounded bis arguments in sup
port of this bitl on two principles, viz. on the
preamble of the Conftitutioa, and on the ppw
ier of Congress to regulate commerce. The
latter he thought a curious idea, that all emi
grants coming to this country (hould be confi.
dered as articles, of commerce. No such idea
could certainly be drawn from the conftituw
on, and it was inconliftent with any exposition
of the word commerce, which he had. ever
heard of. Bur admitting these emigrants could
be coniidered as articles of com me ice, he
.vould ft,II alk whether the principle wouid
goto the extent of this hill ? It would not.
It only went to fay, Congrfefs should have the ;
power of laying a tax ol ten dollars upon their
â¢migration ; as the migration cannot be pro
hibited till the year 1808. Mr. W. could not
fee how gentleman could contend from this
clause of the constitution, that Congress has a
right to prevent tlve migration of foreigners,
(or remove them .after which
would be the fame thing) to individual, ftatcs ?
or whether, if Congress could' fend out one
person, there be any thing in the confthution
to prevent them from fending ou* all aliens
from the country ? And if this could be done,
he Would go so far as to fay, that all that spe
cies of pfoperty (slaves) which may well be
looked upon as an evil, and dangerous to so
ciety, not only at present, but in the moll
peaceable times, may also be sent out of the
country. And as ready as the Southern ftaies
are to grant slaves are a dangerous property,
and an evil irÂ» 1 heir country, they will notcon
fent to Congtefs' alfuming the power of de
priving tlieir owners of them, contrary to
their will. Yet they might as well exercifii
tjus power, as the one they are about to ex
ercise.
Mr. W. did not think was enough to fay
that evils exist, for Congress to proceed to re
medy rhetn. They ought firft to enquire whe
ther they have the conftiHitional power to af
ford tlie remedy, or whether it is not placed
eltewhere. But gentlemen exclaim, shall we
not pun.fh perfoiis who commit ortences i He
would aufwer, Yes; but this bill does not 1
propose a punishment for an offence, or that j
persons shall be convicted beforethey arepu- :
nrfhed and lent away. Aliens are to be sent !
out of the country on -fiifpjqion, which is not
to be ascertained by any known tribunal, but
at the'dilcretipu of the Prelident of the United
States ; and as it would be unpoftible for him
perlonally to attend to cases which may hap
pen in diuerei.t parts of the U. States, he must
have correspondents in different parts of t e
U. States, upon whofc x inforination he will
have implicitly to rely. He must also delegate
his power to persons within the different states
â-and though he.migfu not himfelf abuse it,
noone could fay that none of his agents would
do so. Besides, it is inconsistent with the pro
visions of our cwnltitution, and our modes of
jurifpruder.ee, to transfer power in this man
ner, and he conceived that it would be better"
to endure a temporal evil than to violate the
const I ,tu tion.
The latter gentleman from Malfachufetts
asserted another curious principleâa principle
which he never heani advanced before, Viz.
That it the states think this law a violation of
their right, they might pass a law to contra- 1
vene it. Could then the power exist in both
the state governments and the government of
the U. States, if gentlemen wished to
duce a state of things which he was not defir
-011 s of feeing, this, in his Opinion, is the way
loeft'ectit. The conftitutiortadmitted of 110
such prioeiple as this.- It a law was patted it
was immediately it was according
to the constitution ; as it was supposed Con
gress understood their powers too well to pass
a law which the Constitution does not give
them authority to pass. It would not do for
them to fay to the states " you have been
Ibackward in your duty, and therefore we will
do it tor you. n It is their power, arid they
have a right to use it,or let it atone.
It had been said the ift article of the ninth
fettion of the constitution relates ot)ly to slaves
âbut the term migration gould not relate to
(laves ; lince they were not imported accord
ing to their free will : It must apply to emi
grants, not only from foreign countries, but
from one state to another ; and as far as lie
ever understood the ground upon which that
clause was adopted, it was, in orderto accom
modate thole states who have large tracts of i
uncultivated country, by permitting them to '
have leave to admit of such migrations as they
should judge proper, for a period which they
deemed fulficient to insure them a fufirciency
ot population. Indeed, he believed the con
stitution would never have *een adopted
without a clause of this kind, /as those states
who were in this situation, and who brought
forward the clause, would never have agreed
to it without such a provision.
But the gentleman from Maffachufett6, said it
would be hard indeed, if Congress had not the pow
er of preventing people from scattering feiitioo
through the country. He agreed with that gcatle
man it would be ha r d if Congress had not that
power. But is this bill merely for the purpose of
punishing offences ? No such thing ; it is for the
purpose of fending persons out of the country be
fore they have committed auy offqnee. If the bill
merely provided punishment lor offenccs,^which v/e*Â£
defined, he should not ohje& to it ; but it was of p
much rnsrc arbitrary cast.
The fame gentleman went on to fay what a par
ticular nation had done; but this bill does not re
ate to *ne nation but to aliens from aH countries ;
land because other nations have done mischievous
and turbulent a&s, are we, said he, to violate oijr
const tution, merely to come at particular ch .rac
f<:rs He would not do ir. If there were no rthar
means of doing it, he % would leave them at large :
but he said there w ere oth r means of doing it. Our
constitution, he said, would be a vcryflenicr secu
rity to the people of this country, in the poffeffioin
if th 'fc rights which he fuppnl'cd they never meant
willingly to part with, if, on the cry of tkerc being
danger here, or feditiou3 persons there, violations
wete to be made in it, in order to meet the evil. If
this were once admitted, there would not be want
ing persons who would be ready to take advantage
of these opportunities, to brfng about a radical
change in our government. Vain and idle insinu
ations of this kind havi already had too much
weight in this country, and he hoped they would
not be fuffered to alarm the house into a violation
of the constitution, and, of ceuri'e, their oath to sup
port it.
The gentleman from Maflachufetts last up, said
he N was lurprizcd the bill had heen attacked in this
refpedt. He could readily believe the gentleman
had been surprized, from the arguments he made
use of ; but he could assure him, that it was not be
cause he did nÂ»t think other parts of the bill objec
tionable, that he did not at present notice (hem. If
the unconftitutionality of the measure was fuftici
cnily grounded, it would be unncceffary to go into
those parts bill which the gentleman fuppo
; fes are calculated to bring about a difcufTion on the
Liberty of the Press He hoped, the fetftion would
be ftru k out, because he thought it impoflible to
make this brti any other than a violation of the
i constitution.
MrÂ« Bat ard observed that the gentleman from
I* linfylvania (Mr. Gallatiti) had objedled to this
bill on three di/Fcrciit grounds, viz. In the firft
place, h$ tiates that Coagrels poiTcffes no power
which 19 'not given to it by the constitution, and
that the power of making a law like the piefent is
not g vcft. In the next place he ftate^ f that this
btil militates against that tlaufe of the constitution
which lay* the privilege of the writ #f habeas cor
pus fkall net be lufpended, unless in cases of rebel
lion orinv.ili.>n ; and in the third place, that it mi
litates against that article of the constitution which
fays that Congress ihall not prohibit the migration
of such persons as the state* shall think proper t o ad
mit, before a certain period.
With refpedl to the firft.objeiftion he agreed with
the gentleman from Pennsylvania tliat Congress
had !>â¢ power, but what was given them by the
constitution. He thought the r 2th article of the a
mendments conclusive on this point. Heconfcfkd,
however, he could not fee why the gentleman fliould
refer to any proceedings under the old confederal
tion, to support his becaufe this govern
ment had beÂ«n lubftituted in of that, and de
rives its powers ami authority from the constitution,
*nd not from any thing done under the old govern
ment. But Mr B. contended, that the power was
expressly, if not fpecifically given to Congress, by
the Ift article of the Bth fedlion of the constitution,
which* is in the following words, " Congress ftuil
have power to lay and colled taxes, duties, imports
a-id excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the
common defence and general welfare of the United
6tates : hot all duties, tmpofts and excises, fliall be
uniform throughout the United States."
Thus, then, it is evident that the power is ex
pressly given to Congress, to provide tor the conv
mon defence and general welfare and it is not we
ceflary to be'given fpecifically. The
article of the fame fe<Â£tion also pro/ides,
44 tliat Congress Ihall make all law 9 which fliall be
and proper for carrying into execution
the foregoing powers." Hence it is extremely
clear that Congress has the power to do what is ne
cessary for the common defence and general wel
fare ; and the only question before the committee
is, whether this law is necessary for thvfe purposes ?
Because if it is, it coines wirhm the exprel's letter of
theconl|itution.Therefore,inftead of arguing against
the constitution, it became necessary for the gentle
man from Ptnnlylvania to shew that the provisions
of this bill are not necessary for the common de
fence and general welfare of the United State*. Mr.
B. then read rhe provisions of the fe<ftion. With
respeCt to the firft description of aliens here spoken
of, viz. felons, Mr. B. supposed it must be the wifti
of the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and every bo
dy else, to free our country from infamous charac
ters kind. In order to prove that Congress
have not the po <ver to fend out of t)Â»e country per
sons of this description, the gentleman has had re
course, not to the constitution, but to the laws of
Pennsylvania. But when the law -which he had
adduced, was considered, it confirmed the propriety
of fending off from the country men who had been
convi&ed of felony in another country , for that
law ft?ys, persons of this description shall not be
permitted to come into the country at all. And
could there be any doubt, he asked, of the propriety
of this condu<ft ? He was certain the gentleman
from Pennfyluania could not fay it would be for
the welfare of this country to admit characters, who,
having offended the laws of their own country, as
well as every sense of morality, cÂ®uld not be expect
ed to become good citizens here, or serve any pur
pose which the gentleman from Pennsylvania or any
other gentleman could have in view.
The next defcript on of persons against whom
this bill is dtre&td, includes aliens who are fugitives
frdm justice on charges of treason or sedition. And
can there, he asked, be any more doubt as to the
propriety of excluding from the United States this
class of aliens ? He believed not. It might easily be
supposed, that persons who have been guilty of trea
son' Or sedition in their native country; who have
bcÂ£n able to break all the tics of allegiance and af
fe<ftion for one government, w?Il not become very
obedient 6r peaceable citizens here ; it cannot be exr
petSted that these exotics will support thl. govern
ment, when they have notoriously opposed ps
the country which they have dcCcrted. " This provi
sion, he faitj, would Â®wly extend to those aliens
who had been in the country a less period than two
years, and he thought such a provision would be
very proper *0 operate upon this description of per
sons. Fo when he law men amongst us, who had
been in the country 15 or 20 years, wanting in at
tachment to this country, and even some men
who ojjrc their birth to it, he supposed but little de~
pendente could be placed upon the attachment Â©f
alierjs to this government, who have hcen here a
ftiorter period than two yearÂ«, and that it might be
supposed they yvovild be as likely to join the stand
ard of an enemy, in cafe of an invasion, as that of
this country.
The third description of persons included
in this bill art-J'.sofe whofi.- continuance in the
United States the President (hull deem inju
rious to the public ' t aud frfety.
Uf>on this heafl, the gentleman trom Penn
sylvania mig.ht, perhaps, differ trom him ?n
opinion. He thought the consideration was,
whetlier, if this power wasgiven'to t-he Prc
fideot, lie would abuse it ? He had no-limi
tation in faying that he had so much confi
dence in the Prefidentas tobelieve the power
would npl be atyufed. And if we ha.l reli
ance that power would not be abused, he
did not think any other objection could be
brought against it ; because if it was not abu
sed, no person will ever be fer>t away whose
residence is not judged dnngeroiisto the pub
lic peyce and falety of the United State 6, and
such persons no one couUl wifti to be retained.
Mr. B. concluded,' therefore, that the
power of Congress to ac"t upon all the diffe
rent cases contained in this fedlion is ftridtly
contained in the constitution, by the two
clanfcs which he had read to th? committee.
\Vith rt'fpei:t to the objections of the gen
tleman from Pennsylvania, that this clause
will operate against that clause of the Consti
tution which fays the writ of Habeas Corpus
shall not be suspended, he certainly had not
formed an accurate Opinion upon that f Ã¼bjoll.
In order to know whether this is a suspension
of the writ of Habeas Corpus, it will be pro
per to enquire what is a suspension ot it?
This is a definite idea, eftablifned by prece
dent. In England, it is well known, there
is the fame provision, and we know it has
been occasionally fufpenctod. What then was
to be dw: in that cafe ? It is provided by
tawnlial the Habeas Corpus shall not iiluc at
ail qil. Before the gentleman from Pennsyl
vania can fay, therefore, that the Habeas
Corpus is suspended, he must shew some act
by which it is declared to be so. This bill
provides only for the arreftation of persons in
certain cases, and it will be competent
for every pcrfon (o arreft-d to obtain a
writ of Habeas Corpus. It wysoow extreme
ly clear, therefore, that this writ iniglu Mill
illiie to the fame extent as before.
The last againft the firft fee*
tion of this bill, is founded on the article
which relates to the prohibition of the migra
tion and importation of persons iyro this couii
iry. Mr. 3. aficed whether, if thisVill pas-
\VOLVME XIV.
fed into law, it would not be io the power C*
'lie several States to admit of the importation
ind migration of periomin the fame way that
liiiy do at present ? This bill provides only,
iltat it any improper or dangerous pprfoiu
'hall be admitted, in order to preserve the
pubiic peacÂ« and fafety, the Prcfident (liall
have power to remove them out of lite coun
try.
If there was any solidity in this obje&ion,
Ihe consequence would oe, that the criminal
laws of the Uniied States which would sub
ject any of these Aliens to inijirifonment, or
other punishment, might be equally charged
with being violations of the Conititntio/i,
, which, according to the gentleman from PennÂ«
tylvariia, lias reserved all power over Alien!
in the hands of'the State Governments.
Mr. Baldwi* said, whenever a bill waÂ«
introduced into the legiftature of the Union,
which ran courxer to the conllitution, it waÂ»
its duty to deÂ£)ineaÂ£ting upon it. That part
of the tirfl article ol ffle Srh which
declares " CongrelsYkall have power to pro
vide for (he common defence and general wel
fare of the United States,*' had never beet*
conlidered as a source of legislative power,
a, it is only a member introduced to limit
the other parts of the femeiice, and not ofit-
I'elfa fnbftantive power as will be seen by re-<
cltrring to the worths 6t the ill sentence of the
Bth section. The lie ft 'lance in which it
had ever been attempted to be acted upon,
and no queltioti ever agitated the councils of
the Union more, was, on tlie application of
the Abolition Societies to Co'ngttf? for as a
bolirion of Slavery, the power of Congress to

A gentleman in his eye (Mr. Daylon) re
minded him of another inllance in which thiÂ»
article had been resorted to N for power, witli
jlie fame want of (uccefs. It was in relation
to the ellablilhmentof certain Manufactories,
ill support of which the aid of Government
was applied for. Indeed, if these w : ordÂ«
were to havt the force which it had been at
tempted to give them, all the red of the Con
llitution would be furpluflage. lie could not
have supposed that at this day there had been
1 a dobut on the subject. As to the other clauftf
which had been cited, which was generally
1 called the fwteping clause, " to pals laws !.Â»
; cafry into eft'edl tlie foregoing powers &c."
before it could have any force, some other
1 clause mud be found to which it i 9 to give
eft'eit.
To adopt the lenfe which gentlemen wish
to put upon the fir.l article of the Bth fe6tion,
would be to do away all ideas of this being *
Federal GoverÂ«ment, and that there arc date
governments in exidence who have their por
tion ot power ; for if all the power which i*
neceflary to " provide for the common de
fence and general welfare," be poflefled by
the Federal Government, all the State Go
vernments mud fall prodrate before it, as
there will be no pow-r left for them to exer
cise. Indeed the doctrine is so extravagant,
<hat he never expefted to.have heard it again
: advanced on this floor.
' Mr. B. thought the ninth feflion forbiding
Congress to prohibit the migration &c. waÂ»
directly oppofetfto the principle of this bill.
He recollected very well that when this ninth,
feflion ef the Conllitution \' as underconfide
ration in the Convention, the delegates fro til
fotne of the, foutheln dates infilftd that the
prohibitionof the intyoduition of Haves ihoulii
be left to the state governments: it waÂ»
found expedient to rjiake this pvovilion in thp
cond tution ; there was an objection to the
use of the word (laves, as Congress by none of
t heir afls had ever acknowledged the exigence
of fnc-h a condition. It was it length fettled
on the words as they now (land, " that the
*' migration or importation of such person*
[ " as the several dates (fajll think proper tÂ®
i " admit, fliould not be prohibited till the
" year iSSo2." It was observed by fume genâ
â  tl-'men present that this exprtflton would ex.
end to other persons besides Haves, which
was not denied, but this did not produce any
; alteration of it. Mr. B. had no doubt that if
this bill parted imp ji law, Congress would
! again be applied to by the advocates for .-.a
; abolition of slavery, with rcquetts that the
I Prelident may be authorized to fend these
i persons out of the country, and drong argti
j ments will be uled in favour of the measure.
I He recolletted it was asked on a former occa-'
not), " Stippof* a cargo or leprous personÂ»
, were to be landed in the country, would not
j Congress have the power,to fend theui out of
j ihe country ? Slavery said they is an incup-
I ble leprufy, you surely, tjien, will eradicate
; it r" This (Mfoning, however, did not pre
; vail. TFlere are other mfcli-cfs which might
be done, againli which the federal confiitiiti
on makes no provi/ion. Persons might burn
our towns and (lay our inhabitants. But out
goes upon an idea that tliere art"
Srate Governments who divide (he powers oC
Government wilt the Federal Government.
But gentlemen in speaking on this f'ubjefi,
feeni to forget this, and to suppose thaC
Wisdom is to die with them. His opinion wa
that this business of admitting or banifhimf
aliens l elonged to the State Governments,
and not to the General Government, and he
Ihmild therefore vote for (In King out the fir it
feClion of the hill.
Mr. Dana did net before kuoiv that the
society of Friends were so turbulent a set of
people as to oe- afion all the uneasiness whic'j
the gentleman from Georgia had spoken of.
He wondered so great a dili rder lud not bee.Â»
more particularly noticed.-- As it hnd not, h'Â»
appi-ehended the genilemat.'s real had give i
fomewhar of too high a colouring to this,
tranfadtion.
That part of the fit ft aiticle of tie Btli fee
tion of tiie cootlirutioii, which fpcaks ofths
common defence and general welfare, is of 7
political nature, and docs not refer to any in.
ternal regulation, but applies to whât relates
to the Union generally. As it Aliens
could it be laid that the individual Â«; 3 tcl
could make the present regulation! No , they
could only ijiake regulations bottomed 'upon,
their own policy. What relates to the Umo
gtnerally, mult be done by the Government
oflhe United States. When powe. is reserved
by the Conllitution totlie States, it isfoi r-a
fons which are applicable to these States â¢
and It might be calily seen what was tlie
ground of the copprotriife made in the fifll
article of the 9th fe.'tion. It was cert â , n!y w itl,

property vh!ch they polliffid. !; - Uia# rÂ«a-tor does not extend to the principles of this
bill, which 4oc snot fay (he Stateslhall not ad
ma the migration of foreigners; but that
where p4rfons have n<tt attained the right ot
c tizewlhip, they (hall be removed, if their
reiidence (hall appear to the Prelidcnt to be
dangerous.
*There is one power, Mr. D. said, inherent
and common in every form of Government,
which is founded upon any rational prinCi
pies of policy, which is, the power of preferr
ing itielf, w iiich implies thenecellary power of
making all laws which are proper for th s pur
pose. thin ar les, whether it is
not confident with that power to pass a law
tor the purpose of removing from the coun
try 'he dele options of perlons .mentioned in
the firft feÂ£t?on of this bill. Whether this is
the best mode of carrying such a power into
rs not now tlie quefHon.
Ms. D. thought the declamatory harangue
which had been heard from the gentleman
from N. Carolina on the ("anility ot the Con
stitution, was foreign to the urefent
since no one w ill be found to fay he is willing
to violate the conftiturion. The firigle quertion
before the committee is, whether Cpngreft
have the coiitlitutional power to pass the pre
sent bill ; if they have nor that power, no
6ne, he |,refu:ned, would wifli to pass it.
Mr. Allen laid, the object of this bill,
appeared to* be, to enable the President to
aliens out of the United States whose
reii tencc he (hall judge to be injurious to the
pub! peace and fafety. It appeared to him
tha* there ii> for so many liws re
fp< t ting Aliens. He did not believe that a
lean's being bem in England or Germany, is
any j loot 01 his being an Alien friend. He
may ft.lt be an adopted citizen of another
Country, and come here for the worst of puft
fo(es. Htf thought the President ought to
have power over Aliens of every description,
without dittinCtion. He flip poled this bill was
to appertain only to Alien friends, because
there is anotherbill respeCting Alienenemies.
He did not think. Congress ought to legislate
in this way. Provision ought to be made for
the removal of all these persons.
The powers given to the Executive, Mr.
A. said, are of an unlimited, confufed na
ture, and fych as he had never before seen. 1 f
hedeems the reiidence of an Alien dangerous
to the public fafety, the President is to order
his removal. But the bill does not fay Whe
ther any of the Courts are to take cognizance
of the business, and make the removal, or in
what manner it is to be dope. The bill speaks
of Aliens, having been felons, or notorious
fugitives from justice in a foreign country,
frow are these things to be ascertained? Or
how are the perlons of these Aliens to be iden
tiliea ? Â» e couiti not underftund how this bill
was to operate. He understood the constituti
on to give a right to all persons to be tried
by a jury; but it appeared as if the Judges
were under this bill toaÂ£t summarily.
IV* r. A. thought a law ought to pass au
thoring the Executive of this country, as in
all other countries, to remove all Aiens, of
whatever country, whom he judged d*ig--
rons to the peace of the country. He thought
it wouM'be belt firfi to take up the bill from
the Senate on this subject, and he moved the
committee to rife tor this purpose.
Mr. A. concluded (vith faying that he
wilhed a law to be patted for the pumfhment
oi seditious persons ; but he would h|ve it
embrace other casesâcases of great impor
tance which every day comes before our eyes.
As to the provinons contained in this bill re
speCting seditious (peaking and writing, he de
fied any person to know what was intended
by them. He hoped when Congress pass laws
on this fu bfeet, they would be such as wÂ«uld
be underltood.
Mr. Sew all said, before the question was
taken on the committee's rjfing, he wished to
notice the charges which the gentleman from
Connecticut had brought against the commit
tee who reported this bill. That gentleman
wished the committee'to rife, because he tho't
the till unworthy the attention of the com
mittee of the whole. He wished to have no
dilti'nCtion made betwixt alien friends and a
lien enemies. He (Mr. S.) on the contrary,
was ofopinion, that to take up aliens, merely
as (uch, would be an act unworjhy of any ci
vilized nation whatever; if they are thus
dealt with, it mil ft be because their refrdence
among# us would be dangerous to our own
peace and fafetv. The (elect committee made
a difliitClion betwixt alien enemies and alien
friends. Nor have th'y said that all alien ene
mies lh;Â» 11 be sent out of the country ; but 1
that persons ot that description who are not
fufpeited of being inimical to the interests ot
this country, fliali be protected. The com
mittee have gone further and said, that aliens,
not alien enemies, who are of such a descrip
tion as that their reiidence amongst us would
be likely to be injurious to the peace and fafe
ty*cf the country, may also be sent away. In
the bill refpectihg alien enemies, discretion is
left with the President to treat them accord
ing to exiitingcircumftances. By the present
bill, aliens render themselves liable to be sent
away, who come here under such disadvanta
geous circumstances of character as to render
their refrdence ainongft us dangerous. As to
the particular manner in which this is to be
done, when the third feition of the bill came
under confederation, it might undergo any a
mendment which might be thought necellary.
In the third felt ion, as it was not desirable
that the President should be continually exer
*ifing the discretionary power lodged in him,
cases are described, where farts are only ne
celFary for ordinary tribunals to fend aliens i
out of the country. But where a difcreuona- ,
ry power was neceflary to be lodged, it is
placed in the President alone j since in the o
pinion of the committee, it would have been
perfectlyabfurd to have lodged a difcretiona- :
ry power over these aliens in a number of dif- <
ferent tribunals. For, in that cafe # an alien !
driven from Maflachufetts or Pennsylvania,
might take refuge in any of tfie other states ; '
whereas if this power was excrcifed by one
man, by one undemanding, it would bealways 1
exercised in the fame way. He thought,
therefore, the bill flood very wellln its pre- i
sent form. ]
Thequeftionon the committee's rising was ,
put and carried, and leave was given to it/to

DEDHAM, July 5 .
FOURTH OF JULY.
Men of the'moft correft information, who arc old
enough to remember the progrrfi of our rtvolbtion,
allure us, that such a patriotic spirit as appears at pre
frut has not been awakened finer '74. The young
men especially, now as well as at that time, are high
ly fedeial and patriotic. As a proof of ihe renewal
of tÂ«uc American sentiments in a part of the country
where very gro& delusion and jacobinism has, per
haps, too much prevailed, we notice with pleasure
the celebration of the birth.day of American inde
pendence in this town, by a number of gentlemen
of this and the adjoining towns. The company din
ed together. A truly federal, patriotic, elegant and
fpirired oration, by John Lathrop, jun. Esq. was re
ceived with great applauseâaster which the follow
ing federal toasts were given, under the difeharge of
cannon.
t. The DayâMay every anniversary of indepen
dence give a year'Â« growth and ftrcngth to the patri
otism that will defend it.
2 Our free republican conftitution âAs that secur
ed our Union, may our Union secure the constitution.
3. Liberty and good government âMay we never
be compelled to make the experiment of monarchy
or anarchy !
4. JOHN ADAMS', President of the United States
âMay his Country* never deny him,that reward,
which will be beflowcd by his conscience and by pof
teiity.
5. George WashingtonâMay his happiness
be as serene as his glory.
6. The Vicc-Â»Prefident and Ctjpgrefs âMay they
never forget their duty, nor linger in performing it
7. The Governoi (long life to him} and Common
wealth (God bless it !)
8. Ttmothy Pickering, Secretary of StateâMay
our enemies find the American fwoid as keen- as his
pen.
9. Oliver Wolcott, Secretary of the Treasury

CONGRESS.
Yeflerday, the House of Reptefentativet of
the United States, took up the amendment!
of the Senate to the bill authorizing the Pre
fidrnt of the United States to borrow money
for the Public Service. One of these propos
ed to (Irike out the w <rdÂ» which give the Pro
ficient the power to borrow fueb afum of money
as beJballjudge necejjary, and to limit the sum
to five milium of dollars. This amendment
was concurred in, afrer a proportion of Mr.
Harper to amend it by making it seven mil
lions, infiead of five, had been negatived.â
The second amendment proposed toftrikeout
a provision from the bill which fbpulates that
the Government (hall have liberty to redeem
whatever money is borrowed within fifteen
years. The hoi'fe to this amend
ment, 19 vÂ»tes only being in tavanrof it.â
The Senate afterwards informed the hsufe
that'they infilled Upon it, and a committee of
Conference was appointed.
â¢ The house next took up the amendments of
the Senate to the bill to lay and colleft a Di
rest Tax within the United States. The
principal of these amendments proposed
flrike out, in the description of houses pro
posed to be taxed, these words, '< at more than
! one hundred and not more than five hundred dol
lars, and tuoo-ienths t for (he purpose of in
i ierungfour-ientbi ; the effect of which would
, have been to have laid an equal tax of four
tenths ofone per cent. on all houses under the
value of one thoufar.d dollars, instead of hav
ing them in two clafles (as in the bill) the
lowed paying two-tenths, the higher three
tenths of one percent, and of lowering the
rate 011 all houses above the valueof 3,ooodol
lars. This amendment was negatived, there
being only 17 votes for it. The other amend
ments were gone through, and the relult sent
to the Senate.
A bill was received from the Senate to en
courage the capture of the armed velfels of
France by the private armed velTels of the
United States, by allowing a bounty upon the
veflcls taken, in proportion to the numberof
guns which they carry. Mr. Harrisok
moved to poflpone the confideratlon of this
bill until the next feflion. This motion was
negatived 38 to 31, and the bill was com
mitted.
Mr. Harper called up the report on the
fubjeil of balances due from the debtor dates,
the conliderationof which Mr. Allen mov
ed to poffpone till next felfion of Congress.
This motion, after fonie difcuflion, was ne
gatived, 10 votes only being for it. The
house then went into a committee of the
whole on the fubjeft. The report was agreed
to, and a bill was reported in pursuance of it,
which was committed.
The house resolved itfelf into a committee
of the whole on the bill from the Senate for
altering the time of the next meeting of Con
gress ; when Mr. Harper moved to strike
out the firfl Monday in Ko<vember (the time,
fixed by this bill for the next meeting of Con
gress) for the purpose of inferring the firfl
Mo nday in Oflober. This motion was warm
ly opposed ; and Mr. Bayard, with a view
to reject the bill, and dt~ course leave the next
meeting of Congress to take place on the con
(litutional day (the firfl Monday in Decem
ber) moved that the committee rife. The
motion wascarried, 44 votes being in favour
it, leave was reftifed to the committee to fit
again, and on the question, " Shall ibis till be
redd a third lime ? it was negatived, there
being only 21 votes for it. The bill falls of
course.
The Speaker laid before the house a let
ter and (latement from the Treasury Depart
ment, requiring a farther appropriation to da,
fray the expences of the Oltice of the Naval
Department, and for other purposes, ofi6,-
720 dollars. It was referred tÂ« the commit
tee of ways and means to report by bill ore
therwife.

FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES.
REFLECTING on thejiubliccalamitiet
that threaten us, and lamenting the depra
vity of fomc of our countrymen who would
cowardly fell their birth right for a mess of
pottage, and give up their children to be
flavei, rather than (land up like men in their
defence : Ruminating on these these thingt
I could not but be afflifted at their :#poftacy,
when I fell asleep, and had the following
WONDERFUL DREAM j
I thought a neighbour of mine, who had
long borne much of 'he weight of govern
ment on his shoulders j one who cpuld par
rot /He box the cotnpafs with curfts on the
President, as readily as any one I knowâ
This neighbour invited me to go and spend ,
the evening with some ofhisintimate friends.
I told him that his friends vrere not of my
acquaintance : but after much felicitation
I consented. From a building, on each fide
of a narrow ftrett that we parted, there is
sued a compound of vile smells, which he
took notice that I did not.at all rthfh.â
From this building, fays he. proceeds our
cleanliness and our light IâAnd that is
equally neceflary ; for the horse is a noble
animal, and very ufeful to c nvey intelli
gent quick in times of cleft ion I beg
ged him to explain. This building fays
he, ia a Soap-boiler and Tallow-chandler's
(hop ; that is a Stable : And though the
smells from tlttin are ofienfive to si rangers,
cujlom has rendered them, to me, fweetfr
than Arabian gales. Shortly after, passing
the firft and second centinels, armed caf-a
pee, with dnng forks, we were ushered into
the room, which as a room was well enough, i
hut it did not appar like the place my fancy I
had drawn of a Harmony Hall. Nor
yet did it reach my ideas of Pandemonium ;
tho' fufficient signS cxifted of ftshavisg late
ly, risen cut of chaos. I recfilledl to have
seen, some years ago, Mr. Peale's reprefen
tatio.iof Pandemonium rising up "at the
found of dulcet fwcet," thro' a vast column
of fxoke, interspersed with " horrid fhapctand fights nnlioly," and now and then a
jlafli of lightning ; but the building I was
in, with my friend, was by no means equal
to thatâto that where the primeval devilt
held debate. Nor were the guests to be
compared, either for number or refpeda
bility, to those described by Milton. They
might, however, have been some cf their
degenerate poflerify ; and in one part of
their charaft*r they bore a strong resem
blance to their ancello 9, for they were
Sf iritle/i Sunk, Fallen ;
As I could plainly fee when the five lamps
were lighted. These five lamps in th>- hall
wirefo conltruQedas to be on-and indivijihlc.
From thtfe lamps iifued a sudden glare of
lrght, which gave the countenances of the
afftmbled fraternity a momentary gleam of
hope; but some of them ftartng too near
got their eye-lalhes singed off in such a
iriglllful manner, that the others remained
at a more refpe&ful dillance, highly chop
fallen.
When I had cbferved who were prefer t,
it was my intention to have given a detail
of the tranfa&iou during this feflion of the
Â£): van, bur the terror infpi'cd bv the great
oaih prevents. ThiVerrible oath was given
by the prime minijler of the Divan. A per
fen of a genteel figure, well proportioned ;
and whose address was more smooth and iri
fmuating than was his who psrfuaded Eve
to eÂ«t
The j-u)t cf that forbidden free
IVb ,si n Trial tajle brought dcatf: into
The nui'ld nnd allour <uo, s.
He ttond with a huge tome open in his
left hand, and in his rii;ht a large roll con
tain 113 a long scroll oT ames. Each one
kr.eeliÂ»g,fworebythe life of Buonaparte, &
thearmyof England, to dick by one anttSer
to the lalLjand reveal tothing, on pain of be
ingtermented w.th I.aw;o( being pri;,.;d all
over with Blaii;of-hav rg his tongue
cutout *ilh sharp Sheers, of being smothered
to death with Scotch Snnff and then buried
aliVe with frdh Horje dung.
Juil as it was csming to be my turn to
the great oath (which,by the by, I had
d lerniitied not tq take pain of all-the
ab-vc ctirfts) there was heard a terrible
lloife like as it were of a multitude of horses
preparing for battleâSuch snorting and
thumping, and whinnering, and kicking,
and tramping, as made the whole fraternity
stare I When suddenly, put Ihot one of
the divan from the hall, and no more oaths
could be administered till his return.
I could now plainly discover, what I had
long fufpefted, that there was a kind of in
vijibte cord, which held the whole divan fad
to a dreadful gigantic Jive headed monjler at
a great diitance from them ; and each mem
ber of the fraternity were connefted to the
divan by small visible lines, such as bajling
threads, pack-threads, -wax-enJc, thrums, Â£s*e.
but in such a curious manner, as, that when
the monster a great way off, pulled the in
vifiblecord, all the members felt the force
of the pull in such a manner, us to make
now and then oi-e Â»f thejr. call out to 'â¢ flack
a little," for they were choking. And
one time the whole fraternity were ina buttle
and I could observe the whole divan was
anxiously making Jignt to the monster to
" cafe off, for God's fake to ease ofP' or
they should be all (Iraagled. And for fear
the monster wou'd not fufficieotly compre
hend the force of their signs. I understood
they had difffttched ttvo couriers, birÂ«L of
their own feather, with orders to fly quick
to the " Den of Thieves" and there, in the
name of all the foris of Belial, fall down be
fore the great bead, and must humbly beg
of him, to stay his appetite a little longer
â¢with frogs, and fych other food as he has
been accuÃorxud to feed on, until the Uni
ted States should be better prepared ; for
that thty had discovered something that
might lie heavy on his stomach, orftickin
hivivind-pipe, if he pcrfifted in swallowing
us just now.
I mull rot forget to mention, that I took
notice of a very great number of ends, (of
ihofe small lines) hat ging out in all direfti
ons from the divan. From each of these
ends a member had broken away, and made
his escape, till the whole fraternity, which
wa3onceaÂ» numerous as Pharaoh's frogs,
was now reduced to a molt infignificar.t num
ber of molt iuligriificant beings.
The absent member of the divan now re
turned, after having quelled the riot, which
he infermed them was occasioned by Buce
pha'us' breaking lcofe. and proceedingmc.il
wantonly to commit a horrid aft of violence
on the borly of an elegant, tight young
Filley from the antient dominion ; lately in
troduced by a mod honourable member who
can fee but only on one fide.
Thry now proceeded with the great oath,
which I peremptorily refufed takingâwhen
a dout well enoug 1 looking nr-an swore if
I did not take the oath he wouldroll a coach
wheel ov. r me, till I was as full of lumps as
a new tire. Another who had more of .1 Ja
cobin Ipok, declared he would fwalh me a
bout in hct uut/r till my hair was all matted
together like a felt. Another swore by St.
Grifpin if I did not comply he would few
tip my month, and advanced with his all.
Their grimaces becaete more violent, and
fearing the coofeqiiences I broke from them,
attfl made tor the door ; when a lufly raw
bo:.ed fellow met me with a great biglhelsly
a"d fwpre by Jafus if I did not
ly t,ike the oat ihe would bate me till I
ouid not fee to to count five. It is noth
ing at all honey, fays he, b it a few words ;
nothing at all a'moll you ean take it well e
m.ugh inun ; but fi.iding me obdiuatc, he
raised his oal Jtick and gave me a blow on
the head, heavy enongh to split the thick
etl (kull in The room. This rallied my wan- (
dering senses ; each of which retu red to (
its proper ttation, and prefontly I found my.
fdf wide awake : Not in Heil among trait

pate ; but in my own bed, greatly rejoiced

to his exifttnee, by the discharge of a pistol
He behaved rationally uatil ytfte.day even

fulcd to come down from his chamber, al
ledging, in an incoherent manner, that two
persons had constantly followed him, wiih
an intent to murder him, and that he was
sure they were watching for him. I'erfua
fionsto prevail with him were in vain : and
bis having discharged two poltols during
the night, and showing other symptoms of
a disordered mind, made people very cauti

in futh actuation, thatJiecould not be seen.
About two o'clock, a discharge of a pi
flol v.as heard, when the room door being
forced open., he was found weltering in his
blood. Theinftrument of death had been
charged with large, (hot, and had aim ft en
tirely torn away his chin and nose, laying
open, his heaJ in a moll (hocking manner.
The coroner immediately held an In

CHARLESTON. June 16.
The information given in lalt Wednesday's
paper, refpe&ing Mr. Dupont's no: having
been received by the government of the U::i
tid States, we are since informed, was not
quite correft. Mr. Letombe, the cotlful
xeneral of France in Philadelphia, on Mr.
Dupont's arrival from this place, wrote alet
ter to the secretary of ftatc, in which he re
quested an Â«*equator for his successor, Mr.
Dupont, and a paflport for himfelf to leave
America.
No answer having bees given to this letter,
Mr.Luombe, accompanied by Mr. Dupoct,
h. a a conference wi:h the secretary of ilate,
who informed them, that th.j PrehdeiK of the
United State-, had direiM him to i lorm
them, verbally, that he had determined n"t
* .
I to rec:ire or'acknow'edge any now agent
Vom the Hepublis of Frar.cf, until he had

Mr. Letombe hearing nothing ofhis pas

ard in"the letter reiterated his request for the
I exrquator for Mr. Dupont. Shottly aft r.
j the paflport for Mr. Letomb wa< left.at his

In copfequence of this refufal to be ac

one of the American Coumiffioneri, has been or

consequence gone to Bourdeaux, to endeavor to
procure a paflage for America.
Mr. Pinckney is a man who was disposed to
vindicate and support the intcreftsot his country,

The laudable design of ih's alTociation
must be ob ious 'o'all well disposed ciliz&s
when .ts principles usderllood.' Ihe
two objects contemplated are, firft To'give
confidence to our militia, (hould they be
called from heme on aftua! service, that their
families will be attended to during their ab
sence and such relief administered to them
as the nature and "a e of the cafe may re.,
quire. And, as the affociator, reside in their
leveral wards and neighbourhood of the ci
ty, this duty may be attended to with faci
lity and promptness by them.âThe fecoad
is to a d the civil police in support of order
and good government, in cafe it should be
required in the absence of the militia and
volunteers. Many of the affoc-'ators are too
ancient and infirm to bear arms, other* have
religious scruples on that point; but it is
hoped and believed that none will refufe or
negleft to fublcribe to fa benevolent an as
sociation, in which ftich parts onlv will be
affigr.ed to them as the llate cf their consti
tutions and coufcicr.ccs may with propriety
enable them to fulfil.- "The returns made
from such wards as haÂ»e been fully attended
to are numerous and truly refpefiable.
