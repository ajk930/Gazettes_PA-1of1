X R*FLECTIONS ON MONIOE'S " VlgW."
No. 111.
On the 2d Augaft 1794, Mr. Moaroear
x rived at Paris, .the fuceelfor of Mr. G. Mor
ris, who had imprudently displeased the re
public, and who for that reason, at the re
quest of the committee of fafety, hnd been
reoailed. He carried with him ample.tefti- 1
* monies of the sincere good will of all the <k
pÂ«rtire;ts of the gO'vet-rtflfieftT of the United
* to the French nation, and to the re
volution injvh chit wis engaged. On the
x 14th of Atignfl, iie was admitted into the
hall of the convention* when he prelented.
x his credentials and delivered the declarations
x" of the frnate and house of rcprefentative*
with which he was eharged, and at the fame
time allured the convention that the Presi
dent was a&uattd by limilar i'entiments. In
giving an account of this tranfa&ion on the
25th of the fame month, he writes thus
x " The communication was received in a
manner very interesting, and which furnifh
ed at the fame time, the llrongeft proof of
* the affedtion entertained by the French na-.
tion for the United States of America.â
x The enclosed, No. 3, is a copy of my ad- â 
dress to the convention, and of the presi
dent's answer. Every department has fioce
/hewn thrjlnngejt difpojiiion to prove its at
tachment to their ally, by embracing every
x opportunity which the (lighted incident has
offered"â(page 17). This disposition so
propitious to America, when his miniftcrial
x functions were commenced, caimot be attri
buted to him, as he fceais to wilh his readers
" -to believe ; forasyethe had only been receiy-,
' ed or acknowledged : nor is it confident
with what he ftatfS in his view, when he
fays that he found on his arrival, " that
the work of alienation jind - disunion "had '
been carried further than he had before fiif- 0
c pefled," and " that things werp in a tram
for an entire separation of the two coun
tries"â (page 7). It is remarkable that
Mr. Monroe did tÂ»ot intimate to the execu
tive any difatisfaftfon of the French coun
cils with the American administration, until
0 in his letter of the 12th February 1795,
more than fix months after his arrival, when
_ he had occasion to apologize for some of
e his misdoings, which had been reprimanded
y by the executive on the 2d of December J
j. 1 794- No such thing is to be found in his i
Jj; letters dated 15th September, 16th OtStober,
7th November, 20th November, or 2d De- i
f cember, 1794. I cannot therefore but 1
e think that Mr. Monroe has not in his book,
represented with candour, the dispositions t
of France during the firft months of his mis- t
fion, and that he is Hill more in the wrong 1
when he arrogates to himfelf the merit of t
impressing the convention with fcntiment3 c
y of moderation and justice towards the Uait- r
. ed States. The favorable dispositionÂ« f
- the republic proceeded from the state of c
public affaire at tkÂ«t time-. Rubcfpicrre and c
" the of terrrorifts had been just cut c
s off; -the armies were every where vidtorious, i
and thus secure at home, and prosperous
, abroad, a spirit of moderation and equity n
" prevailed in the convention for a little while, t
and was pervading France : Besides there si
was a real want of provisions. Under such c
circumstances, it was impossible not to ob- o
tainpromifes of fatisfaiftion for all our just e
complaints, as well as a removal of the caaf- n
es from whence they had arisen ; and thus p
the alterations for the better, which took c
place at this period, were the natural result p
of public events, and not the consequence o
of our ministers' exertions,as he most vainly d
pretends. ft
, The firft aA of mifconduft which I have w
f proposed to illustrate is, that he represent
ed to the committee of public fafety that ai
; he was not inftrufted to complain of the de- 1
; cree of May 1793, which dispensing with it
some of the articles of the treaty of amity
1 and commerce, was attended with the most h:
j ruinous effefts on the American commerce. t*<j
This is immediately connetSed with the fe- h
condâhis information to the committee, it
that he â¢we/Iknew, that if upon experience it
should be their opinion that it produced any fa
solid good to the republic to disregard thole ct
articles of the treaty, the American govern- It
ment and his countrymen would not only ac
bear with the departure with patience, but tfc
vtithpleafure. These are so united in the cl
documents, that they (hall be considered to- tb
gether. w
A decree of the French republic had been w
made in May 1793Â» authorizing the seizure tb
of enemy's property in neutral veflels, which at
was in force when minister Monroe arrived in
in Paris, and under which the Americans th
had fuffered and were fuffering much vexa- Pi
t:on and injury in their commerce. His pre, of
deceffor it appears, by several letters ef the th
Secretary of the State, had remonstrated a
gainst it, and was endeavouring to produce Pi
a repeal of it when he fuperceded ; and th
not only the existence of the decree, bift w
the ruinous effects of it were notorious from hi
one end of the continent to the other. Up- Ui
) 011 this fubjeft the Secretary of State wrote ej
to Mr. Monroe on the 10th June, as sol- hi
lows : " But yon vfrill go farther and insist ec

I necessary to mafet some enquiry of the fe- 1
the cretar y the treasury, how it had happen- '

ued r ' ef ' into e 2" The reasons given, were 2

the business gpnerjiliyj,
Mr. Nicholas A(idy the<re was a proposi
tion comtnitte4,t<J *'ConimwUe.of the whole
house, far providing for what was intended
nc . to have beeaprartuccd by means this law. f
_ A It was supposed that this law wonl4 have ir
the produced bulliM enough, an&that thequan- t}
to tityof coin iifued from the Mint would si
lim have re(luce4 th e circulation of foreign coins Cl
the t0 a mere tr:fle - Th Â« house had been told ra
j,j s j had not been convenient for the Secrata- h
[ ra . TÂ°f the treasury to fend foreign coin to m
Iq the mint ; but it was not known to a cer- CI
ate f aint 7 w hy this had Hot been done ; wheth-
the 11 was ro . m 'h e of that mint, or '*l
ir. | rom tlle lna bility of the treasury. No one w
_ j could fay whether this law could be carried e<
into effeft in futute. The only way in
j which this could be ascertained, was by the f . r
enquiry proposed. ti
â S. Mr. Gallatin believed, if the gentlemen P (
I who objefted to this resolution would recur l ''
to the situation of this business, they would
er- withdraw their opposition. The report
th * of the committee appointed on the Ll
re- fub i e<a of the mint la st year, which, A
ich not having been afted upon, had been re
ferred to a committee of the whole this fef- Fi
nd (km, and might any day be called |up for
ice consideration', that report proposed the pass- JÂ«
re " ing of a resolution appropriating F '
by dollilrs fÂ° r the purchase of ballion. This re- H
the fohitioii was predicated upon a supposition Pi
ley that the adl in question had not, and could Je
not be carried into effta. But the reason Cl
nt- afiigned for this fuppo.fition was now remov- Fr
ed, as it was founded upon the ground of
r". l h c P'efiden#* not having issued his procla- .V
re _ mation to determine the time when the coin-
to at the mint began. That proclamation g,
Ily had now been ifTued; and he wished to knoyv f.
Nt , whether there was yet a-neeefiity for an ap- 1 M
Â«â¢ . propriation ; he wilhed {to know how far
the law had been executed, what had pre
!rt i ? ented ' ts execution, and whether in future
l c . it could be executed. If it were fouad by re '
it- the information which should be received, I ~
-a that hereafterall theforeign coin which comes
10 into the treasury may be sent into the mint,
there would be no necessity for an appropri

, n carried into effeift, the law ought to be re- JE
to pealed, and an approiation rltade. me
e- _ Mr. Otis faidttie reasons which had been ous
te given in favour wfridopting tS|s resolution, wi(
were, in his opinion, agaiiift i't.â
Though he belifeved the law never could G.
be literally executed, he beWd it"had been
le virtually exeeutecfeo elf=vi>as â¢'â¢aliowed, that
lg before the reporiiolf 'thel'e was VI
id fuflicient reason for not carrying the law in- 1
it to effeift ; and since lhat tim<?, it appeared ]
0 by the mint report, that upwards of 50,000
Â£ dollars had been sent to the mint from the En
Bank of the United States, which he sup- Uv "
I- posed was a large proportion of the caih
g received by the treasury in crowns, and of
>f course, proved that the aft had been execut-
le ed since that time. He believed the law L '
e could not be literally Executed, because the
notes of the Bank of the United States Col
were made a tender for all monies due to q,,.
c the government, and it was well known that [
- all money tranfa&ions, particularly where out
; there were banks, were mostly carried on in Stal
notes. It might be said, these notes were exifl
? s representatives of specie, and that specie refu
might begot for them ;â  but if goveniment ra an
- were always to call upon the Bank of the
United States for specie for their notes,
- where would h< the use of making them le- Shij
' gal tender ? But if the bank were to be cal
' led upon for specie, when they knew it were Brig
. intended to fend crowns to the mint, they
. would mate payment tn.do3lars. Upon the
whole, as there feempd to be fonÂ»e contra- Sch
1 riety between this law and the bank law
making; the paper of the, United States
lawful tender, it would be best-to refer the
business to a fele& committee to have it
properly digested, and not single out this
particular, so as to cast a refletlion upon the
treasury department. Sloe
Mr. Nicholas said, he had before declar- A
ed he had no intention ef calling a censure B]
upon the treasury department. The gen- . Ll
tleman alferted the law had been virtually
executed, for two reasons ; ftrft, because
the revenues being chiefly paid in bank
paper, it had nothing to operate upon.â the 1
: !Â« This was a ft range trny of eiecuting a law.

its produce.

refolution having been done ;â  way, which
ett l Â° Was ver y he (hould not

f e . wilhed for information from any depart
ment Â°f 'he government to enable him to le
ar_ g'flate upon a question, he {hould never be

fat more con sistent, if mote frequent calls were
made. â¢
The motion was put and carried without
a division.

THE Manacxrs particularly request the con
currence of the public in the abolition of a
custom, which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at the
Theatre.
(They are aware that gentlemen are unconfaious
of any wrong done to tne interest of the ir.iVitu-
Tion by this praftiee, from a general, though mis
taken idea that Checks are the representatives of a
right to so many feats in tke Theatre, during an '
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will; Â°f
when in fa<Â£t, they were never intended as more
than token, by which the Door-keepers are enabled W
to ascertain with the lead trouble to the/â ar/iÂ«,that ror
they themfelve, have been before in the I'hcatre, or ly ]
paid for their admission. the
Independent of the injury the Managers sustain,
such a praftice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other disorderly psrfons to surround the doors of
the Thea'.re, to the irruption of their morals and
the great annoyance of the Audience, .
It has also been rhe Cource of two evils of no in-
confidcrable magnitude; one is, that ftanctimes " e
very improp.r c.mpany is by these moans admit- 5"
ted ; and the other, that ro Checks palling vel
into dishonest hands, they have been frequenaly ce<
eounterfejted to a large amount far the purpofesof thÂ«
Sale
This statement will, it is refpeSfully hoped, in-
duce the Public to discourage such a traffic : and
the exertions of the Managers will, if thus affiiled,
easily ppove adequate to its entire abolition.
