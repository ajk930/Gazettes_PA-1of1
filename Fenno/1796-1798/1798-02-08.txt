That, agreeable to the duty thus solemn- <
ly imposed on them, they proceeded to <
take the said petition into oonfideration, 1
and examined the evidence adduaed refpeft- 1
fng the fame ; from which it appears that '
so enquiry was made at to the right of ci
tizenship of any person who vÂ«ted at the
Northern Liberties and Southwark in the
county of Philadelphia, whereby a number
of persons were allowed to vote for Sena
tor who were not entitled to eleft mem
bers of the legislature, and that the number
of persons illegally admitted to vote, as
aforefaid, waÂ» greater than the difference in
votes between the fitting member and the
person next highest in vote, thereby render
ing it impraflicable to ascertain who was
the peifon duly elefted by the qualified
freemen of the said diftrift ; âthey do there
fore give it as their judgment, that the
election and return of Israel Israel, as
Senator for the diftrift aforefaid, is illegal

count it no disgrace that 1 am one of them, or

it be supposed, that men, wUo have spent their

by the labour of their hands, a subsistence for
fbemfelves and their families : and who can
fesreeiy, in many iaftances, find leisure
their bibfiett, and to think about the weighty
concerns of an approaching eternityâthat such
ttca :>.,uld be qualified to ereÂ£ forms of go

iy fail to introduce such violence,, anarchy and
cotifuGoti, as would prove far more intolerable'
than the worfl fort of government
Our v anctjlors were aware Â«f this. It was
not By forming societies or affcuatibns among
the common people, that our revolution was
brought about. It was not by holding conven
tions in which journeymen tailors, barbers, and
flocking tnakers, fat as deputies chofcn by their
brethrenâcalled themfrlves friends of the pec
pie, rndronfulted together for the good of the
Station â¢â¢ The wjfeft men in the three kingdoms;
the men, who by their rank in life, had the la.-ft
opportunities of acquir.r.g politifal knowledge,
anrl the greatest degree of iufluence in the ceuii
try, laid their plans among themfclves, and con
certed raeafures without the privity of those in
the 'ewer ranks of life.
All the above ohfervitions (the whole Â«t Sir
Young's observations "on this head would mike
it too lengthy for a newspaper) are folly con
firmed and illustrated, by the recent example of
our neighbours in France. Their firft national
jflembly, in the year 17?9, was convened with
Come mealure of agre<ablenefs to their ancient
LunJt tuiinas.o hich been fufpen-ied for ages.
Many of them were men of rank, of property,
of learning, and political koowledge._ Had
they been left to the fre<r'exercife of their own
judgements, there is no doubt, but that they
would have given to their country a constitu
tion, whit h night have proved the glory of
France, and a pattern to other nations. But un
fortunate'.y, there were among them, a party
of fadtious and designing men, who formed con
nexions with the populace of Versailles and Pa
ns. And soon, very soon, those beginnings
which had given pleasure to every friend of li- '
Lerty, and of mankind, gave place to the most
gloomy and difallerous appearances. At firft
the comtvon people took un idlive part, other
wise than in choosing their reprefentativee; but
no sooner did the events of the 14th of July
1789, (hew that popular f.vour might be the
road to power, than the fasts culottes began to
think themselves ctpableto manage the affairs of
thena'ion. From that time, the exclamations
of the galleries declared the refolutious of the
affrmbly ; which was then deferred bf its most
virtuous member*. The king was carried a
pri'nner to Paris, where he remained in the
power cf now an organised mob. By this
means a conllitutirn was adopted, which,
though prof/jfcdly designed to have been a lim
ited menirchy, yet aflually gave an opportuni
ty to those who courted the populace, and knew
how to flatter their pafiions, to become >he des
pots of the nation. The second national assem
bly was still more under popidir influence ; and
the ronventlonjnoft of all. i From the time ot
their meeting, all matters were carried by the
votes cf the jacobin clob or by the sovereign
mob of Paris. Then every thing went into
confution Revolutions followed npon the hack

to follow). Five hundred tyrants flarted op

THE CONSTITUTIONAL 1 EST.
No, 111. -
T'E great principle recognized ia the
cos dilution of this (late, and in that of the
I Tel testes "to fiparate the lsgiflative,
ji jnd executive departments in the
Ovemr.:at," it faadioned by' the history
of ill free republics ; innumerable fafts to j h;
cotinrm this important truth, are exhibited j a
in a convincing light in the defence of the ,c.
American conftitittions writtenjby the learn- I tl
ed and patriotick President ADAMS. In | n
these volumes tlie reader may find ample 1 a
proof, drawn from the experience of all a- : g
ges and in every country,where republics !t!
have existed, thtt a free government caii- si
not be durable utilefs the judicial depart- it
ment is guarded from the encroachments of t
the legislative ; that if the legislative branch c
is not confined to the department of legif- j 1
lation, it will by degrees invade the judi- |
cial and executive departments, whereby ; 1
the checks and balance of powers, will be e
loft, and all authority center in the legifla- (
ture. Hereby the all-important fafeguard t
of the rights, liberties and property of the f
citizens, an appeal to the judicial power
for the iaterpretatioa of the laws, and a 1
trial by a jury, is greatly impaired, if not c
entirely left. The executive power in a t
free government cannot support its conftitu- 1
tional authority, unless the judicial depart. 1
ment retaias all its constitutional powers ; 1
for the legislative being naturally the strong- 1
eft branch of government by reason of <
its numbers, the conftitational force of the t
other branches is neceflary to keep this 1
within its just limit*. Sueh a " balanced i
government," is the only " government of 1
laws, and not of men."âln such a gov- ]
ernment only, are the right 3of the people 1
preserved, a trial by a jury, and an appeal '
to independent judges to interpret the laws.
, And such is the government of our country, '
by the conjlitut'irm. But is it so in prali'ue f '
The constitution of thisftate declares, that
" the legislative department (hall never cx
ercife the judicial powers." Yet have we '
not seen it exercise those powers every fef- 1
fion ?âlt is also declared in the cenftito- â 
tian, that â¢Â« in all controversies concerning â¢
property, the parties have a right to a trial
by a jury." But, docs not the general
court deny tliis right of appeal to a jury,
to determine the claims of the citizens up
on the govmrawHt ? Are not the dearest
rights of the people hereby violated, and
in a dire A infraftion of another clanfe of
the constitution, which ordains, that " ev
ery citizen ought to find a certain remedy',
by having recourse to the laws ?" Wc have
in a former paper noticed those infractions
of the constitution ; but as they are so de
flruflire to the right* of the people, they
ought to be held up often to their view. It ,
may be alked, " As all the mejnbers of the
. legislature every year take an oath to main
-1 tain the constitution, do they not read it I
1 And if they do, how comes it to pass that
they do not obey it I"
We state thejfadt, aad it is for the peo
. pie to look for the cause, and find a remedy.
Under the old royal government of theprt-
I vine, the general court exercised the dan
gerous power of determining all claims of
ths fubjefts uponjthe government j the wife
| farmers of theprefent constitution, know
| ing well from the history of all nations,
that the Vrights and liberties of the people
i could not be fecufed, uulefs the citizens
r had the nght of appeal in all matters of
â¢ property, as wÂ«ll as life, to a judicial de
: partinent independent of the legislature ;
| ,aad knowing also the natural propensity of
this tlronge/l department to increase its powers
they guarded this most eflejitial right,
- " appeal to the judicial power, and trial by
1 a jury," by clear expressions, and repeated
paragraphs. . They knew the force of long
. cvjlom, and old precedents, and therefore in
the constitution they doubled and trebled
f the guards round this citadel of liberty,
1 the judicial department, and the right of
t the citizens to appeal to it for the interpre
' tation of the laws, and a legal decision up
on their claims, -without exception. Had
j they intended to except claims upon gov
â ernment, and to invert the legislature with
Y the power of determining them, it would
- have beeu so exprefled ; but it is not.
f The framers of the constitution of the
United States, also apprehending the ex-
treme danger to the rights of the citizens,
. from the interference of the legislative poW
, eis in the states, ordained that they should
- make no laws to " impair the obligation of
1 contrasts;" and consequently atir such laws
* and afts are nullities.âBut notwithstanding
| all the wisdom displayed by our wisest ftatef
y men, in framing the conftitutions,and guard
e ing them by requiring an oath of all the le
-0 giflators to " maintain them."âDo we not
f fee a constant effort in fonie of the legifla
Â» tures to increase their powers (or at least to
Â£ retain what their predeceflors exercised) by
a infringing those of the judicial department?
e Hence the proposal to alter the constitution
1 of the United States, and take aipaythc right
, of the people to appeal to the supreme judi
cial power to decide upon their legal demands
again (I a state. The adoption of this fatal
? measure will destroy at one stroke the most
_ essential rights which were secured to th? ci
d tizens by the federal constitution; it takes a
it way the great and all important right of
Â« every citizen to a trial by a jury, to afcer
n tain his legal title to property when it is iu
Â° the hands of a state ; instead of demanding
r his property, which the laws and a jury
p would give him of right, he is reduced to
y the situation of a Have under the government
if of an absolute monarch, he must put off all
? the dignity of a freeman, and petition, and
s * beg, and male interejl at court, and perhaps
' tribe, to obtain the right secured to him by
' a s law; and after all, if destitute of friends at
r . court, or wanting in the courtly powers of
ir address, he may " dance attendance from
d feflion to fefiion, at the door of the legisla
ture, prayiug their honours for justice," un
til his pockets and his patience are exhausted
and hope fails; he returns home to fpetid the
reft of his days in'poverty and murmursâ
tortured with the idea of fuffying tyranny
io a free government!
ic But, it may be expeftfd that we (hould
ie answer th; obje&ions, to the fnability of a
?, Rate or nation, (as we maintain that the go
ie vernment of Ixjth must be fnable, or the
y rights of the people cannot be secured) it
las been objefted, " that the judgment of j
* court and jury against the government, a
:annot be carried into, execution ;" " that
the fuprcme legiflstare cannot (and ought ]
not) be compelled to pay money, or fulhl 1
jny other sontraft or obligation." The le- '
giflature mult have the power to (letermine 1
the time when the government is able to fill- 1
fil its contracts; and this is power enough 1
in conscience. The judicial department is
to exercise the powrf of determining, ae- 1
cording to Handing laws, what the legal and
just demand of the citizen is.
This, we conceive, is the conftituiiwnal
line, between the ptowers of these two branch
es of government. If this line is-not pre
served, fll power finally, runs into the le
gislature, whereby an arificcraty is Grit e
stablished, and then an nbfolute tyranny. â
The corruption and fall of the ancient as
well as modern republics originated in this
cause. Americans may flatter themselves
that they are too wife to fufTer the like fate;
but if they now permit the most important
right secured to them by the constitution,
trial by ajury, to be taken from them, what
right have we to expeft the long exiftenee
ef freedom?âcan any thing be more arbi
trary or absurd, than for the legislature
to appeal to the judicial power to ascertain
its legal demands against the citizens, and at
the fame time not permit the citizens to ap
peal to the fame power to ascertain their
claims? So extreme is the wrong in this ar
bitrary mode of proceeding, that the citi
zen is liable to befued by the government for
one hundred dollars, and thrown into jail
for not paying the debt, when at the fame
time he holds a note from the government
(due many years before the oilier) for three
hundred dollars, which is refufed in payment
of the one hundred! (according to the fund
ing law of 1794.!) If this spawn of ariflo
cracy was seen only in Europe, how would
our Jlate politicians strain their voices in ex
clamations against it; but as it is their own,
they nonrifli it in their bosoms. The Colos
sus of political error mult be destroyed by
the reason of the people, or it will deitroy
their freedom. It is a riany headed mon
ster in a free country, and poisons ]iberty<at
itsfource; it destroys the great principles
in our constitution, trial by a jury, " go
vernment of laws, and not of men;" and
fubjefts the citizens to the fovcrcign will of
an interested legislature, five hundred or a
thousand miles distant; (fee an aft of Geor
gia) it teaches the necessity of adopting the
language and manners of Jlaves, to court the
influential men in the legislature in order to
obtain that justice which the laws of a jury
would give as a rightâ¢

ficient to awaken our attention.
Where are all the free governments that
once existed in different parts of the world;
and what cause produced the universal ruin?
It is clearly proved by all hiftery, that the
principal cause hasbnenâone branch of go
vernment was toÂ© strong for the other de
partments, by which means it engrossed all

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
WEDNESDAYâ FEBRUARY 7.
Mr. Giles, from Virginia, appeared for
the firft time to day.
The Speaker suggested the pl-opriety of
fending a message to the Senate, informing
them that the Houft of Rreprefentatives
had appointed managers to conduft the im
peachment agaiuit William Blount.
Thequeilion was accordingly put and
carried.
Mr. D. Foftcf, from the committee of
claims, made an unfavouiable report on the
petition of James Soyer, which was con
-1 curred in by the houie.
Mr. Thatcher, from the committee on
poft-ofnees and poll roads, to whom was re
fitted a resolution of the 12th of January,
prApofing that the Attorney General {hould
have the privilege of receiving and fending
letters and packets, free of postage, moved
that that committee have leave to report on
this fubjeft by bill or otherwise.âAgreed.
The order of the day being called for,
Mr. Sitgreaves said, it would be recollect
ed that he had yesterday given notice that
the managers appointed to eondudt the im
peachment against William Blount, would
to-day, .at 12 o'clock, exhibit the said arti
cles before the Senate. As thawime was
near at hand, and as it was usual on all fol
emti occasions like this for the house to give
fanftion to its managers by an attendance at
the time, he thought it would be better
that the house fhooldnot resolve itfelf into a
committee of the whole, until this business
was done. It might be expefted a message
would shortly be received from the Senate
oa the fubjeft.
After some coriverfation on the fubjeft, it
was resolved to go on with the order of the
day, until the message from the Senate
(hould be received.
The House accordingly again resolved it
felf into a committee of the whole on the
report of the committee of privileges, Mr.
Dent in the chair; when,
Mr. Dana rose and complained that the
printers, notwlthftanding the prohibition of
the Speaker of yellerday, continued to re
port the evidence delivered before the com
mittee, before it was correfted by the mem
ber* themselves. He said it had been repre
feated that he had said, the only cause of
heat betwixt him and Mr. Lyon, had been
the amendment of the gentleman from Vir
ginia 011 the question refpefting Foreign In
tercourse; whereas he had Hated there was
other conversation which tended to irritate
him, though, it was true, he did not fay
.what the conversation was. He would now
however state some of the particulars. Mr.
â  D. was proceeding, when it was proposed
that what the member had to add to his evi
dence (hould be delivered to the committee
1 in writing.
Immediately after this proposition was
â  made, a message was announced from the
Senate, informing the house that the Sen
-1 ate would be ready to receive the articles of
â  impeachment agaiaft William Blount, at
' twelve o'clock.
That hour being neat at hand, the com
-1 mittee rose, and the house adjourned foj
1 half an hour.
, The managers of the impeachment, ac
compamed by the mem! â¢ of th'fe"
house accordingly went lip to tlir Senate for
the pnrpofe of exhibiting the articles of itrn
peachment against William Blount; whe*,
being introduced, Mr. Sitgreavea made
known their million by an address to the
Prcfident of the Senate; after which, the
President having, said the Senate were tezAj
to receive the articles of impeachment; and
the Serjeant at aims having proclaimed ftN
ence, the other managers havingtaken tWeir
feats appointed.them, Mr. Sitgreaves pro
ceeded to read the article's of impeachment;
which having finilhed, the President of the
Senate returned for answer, words to the
following effeft:
" Gentlemen, managers on the part of
the house of Representatives, the Senate
will take such order on the articles of im
peachment which you have exhibited before
them, as ftiall seem to them proper, of
which due notice will be given to the hotife
of Reprtfentati-ves."
Upon which_the managers and members
retired.
The house of Representatives then resum
ed their meeting; when Mr.T.Claibornein
troduced a motionfor providingtheSenatorfc
who should if any tfm9 attend the debates
of the house, feat 3 on the right and left of
the fj;eaker. After some few observations
this motion was postponed till the 3d of
March, 1799.
The Speaker laid beforethe house a com
munication from the Treasury Dtpjrtment,
iucloftng a report and sundry flatements of
expenditures in the military and naval de
partments, in consequence of three refols
tionsof 3d of March f 797, which were or
dered to be printed ; those which bad rela
tion to the naval department were referred
to the Â«ommittecappointed to esquire into
the expenditure of money in that depart
ment ; and those which related to the mili
tary eftaUifhment were referred to the com
mittee of varys and means.
The house then again resolved itfelf into
a committee qf the whole 011 the report of
the committee of privileges ;-when Mr.
Varnum was called upon to gfve his tefti
uiony.
To attempt to fpllow the course of this
examination would prove an unprofitable la
bour ; it would fill our paper to "no good
purpose", finee the preceedings upon it were
very tedious and irregular,
and the evidence itfelf unimportant ; as it
went only to prove that Mr. Lyon had told
Mr. Varnum soon after the affray happen
ed betwixt him and Mr. Grifvvold, that he
had been provoked to the aft which he had
committed by Mr. Grifwald's having twice .
repeated the sarcasm of the IVooden Sword
âa circumstance on whigh there seemed to
be little or no doubt iu the minds.of any of
the committee.
The evidence "of Mr. Varnurn being gone
through, and Mr- Van Cortlandt havmg
been sworn, th< chairman desired to know
if any other evidence was intended to be.
called ; if it was, it would be well to have
. the gentlemen named whilst the Judge of
the Diftrift Court was pvefent.
Mr. Lyon said, if ai>y gentleman of the
'committee were prtfornt at the conversation
which palled betwixt him and the Speaker,
he should wish them them to be sworn.
1 He believed Mr. Harper and Mr. Cochran
â were present.
Mr. Stanford said he also was present;
The oath was in consequence.administer
ed to Meflrs. Harper, Cochran and Stan
ford.
The committee rose and had, leave to fit
ag-in.

ON MR. LTON's CASE.
THE proceedings of Congress,
to the expnlfion of Malt-hew Lyon, mutt
wound .every American to the heart. It
was with reverence that I had beheld what
ever was doing in the house of reprefenta
tivee. I had hoptd that America would
have been an example to nations in the
praftice of government, and that her delib
erative. councils would have remained mo
dels of decency and propriety. I mourn
over the disgrace that the vile aftion of this
unworthy member has fixed, indelibly fixed,
ob our national charaÂ£ter. I perceive with
inexprefTible anguish the power of party
fpirit in the procedure of the house, which
already seems to have taken hold of the
cafe, exclusive of all other considerations,
(If on this occalion, good sense and good
temper do not get the better of psrty-feel
ifip, it my be eocfidered as certain they
wilt not oil any other which can occur dur
ing the present felTion.
ThÂ«t one member should fpifrfn the face
Â«f another during die fitting of the house,
it an aft so vile, so b?f?, so abominable, so
v.orfe than brMtal, that our language can-
not aptly dcfiribe it. No words of prdvo- \
cation can excuse it. " Even if th. ii; flag- â :
greilion .had proceeded from the Cbfinefti- i
cut member, which was not faft, th; 1
indignity to him arid to the lioufe is too
detestable to admit of any other punilhment i
but expulion. The firft aggression came i
from M. Lyon, when he that the Con- ;
nefticttt members with deceiving their con
{lituents, and afting from fdfifh motives, ,
contrary to their known opinions. It it be
said this was in jest, there is the fame rea
son for faying that the name of the Woodeu
sword waÂ» in jest also ; but furelv the salu
tation in the face was not meant as a joke.
If the parties were in jsll, previous to this
detestable aftion, it is the more aggravated :
If they were in earned, thro Mr. Lyon was
the original aggrelTor ; f> thst in every
point of view, he Hands without exeufe.â
But even if words of "provocation had been
firft uttered to him, they ought not to have
been resented in a manner to mean and con.
temptible. For the Honor of our country,
and for the dignity of the House of Repre
sentatives, let him be expelled. It is the
only punifhmeut faited to the! offence that
is in the power of the House, and unfortu
nately it is inadequate.
If he is not expelled, party spirit, blind,
obstinate, inveterate party-spirit, will alone
be the canfe ; and they who shall vote a
gainst his cxptilfion, will attach to them
selves a part of the fiiame of the original j
aft. The will abet and countenance the â¢
vile aftion, and in public sentiment ought j
and will share the ignominyâThey will be 1
stigmatised as the friends of disorder. I
trull there will not fee such men found in â¢
the bouse, who (hall by their votes keep
him among them. If any such there fnall
be, lit them be branded with infamy, let
them be excluded from civilized society, let
them be shunned as barbarians, let them be
the fcotn of mankind, let a mark be put
upon them as unworthy of public employ
ment, but let riot even such men be /pit upon.
It is provided excellent constitu
tion. that " each house may determine the
rules of its proceedings, punilh its members
for disorderly behavior, and with the con
currence of two thirds expel a member. In
the inflance of Mr. Lyon the -house is a
boi>t to determine an important question,
w&ether a member ought to be expelled in
any cafe whatever for disorderly behavior.
Certainly if any cafe can exist when ttxpul
fion ought to be the punifliment, the pres
ent is one. If in this cafe erpulfion is not
to be inflifted, I beg it may bo seriously
considered, whether in any cafe whatever it
ought. Let a cafe be imagined, if pofli
ble, where expulfien should be inflifted, if
it ii omitted in this. What then will be
the consequence if Mr. Lyon is not expellr.
Ed ? The house will fix a precedent that
nullifies this provision of the constitution,
that makes it a dead letter, and e&ablifties
that in no cafe for disorderly behavior
ought a member to be expelled. Before fe>
pernicious a. precedent is set, I hope the
consequences will be seriously examined and
weighed by those to whom are committed
the dearest rights of society.

THE BANK.
The (ommittee of Secrecy appointed to enquire
â¢whether it may be expedient further to contin
ue the Rejiridion contained in two Slcls
made in the lafl Se/Jion of Parliament, refpee
ing payment in cajh by the bank, have enquired
accordingly, and agreed upon the follo wing
Report, viz.
Your committee have in the firft place ex
amined the total amount of otit-ftanding de
mands on the Bank of England, and of the
funds for discharging the fame, and find
from the examination of the governor and
deputy governor of the Bank, and the doc
uments produced by them, jthat the total
amouut of outstanding demands on.the bank
was on the I ith day of thisinft.i 7,578,9101.
and that the total amount of the funds for
discharging the fame (without including the
permanent debt due from government of
i 1,686,8001. which bears an interest of 3
per cent.) was on the fame day 21,418,4601.
leaving a balance or surplus in favour of the
bank (excltsfive of the above mentioned
debt from Government) of 31839,5501.
Your committee next proceeded to exam
ine the principal articles of which- the a
bove mentioned sum of 21,418,4601.
â¢ the credit fide of the account, is made up
with a view of ascertaining how far the bank
might be enabled to resume its accustomed
payments in cash, in cafe the reftriftion at
prefect subsisting (huuld be removed.âAnd
your committee find, that the advances to
government have on the one hand, been so
,-nuch reduced finte the 25th of Febiuary
last,. as'to amount on the said 1 lth of this
inft. to no more thrn the sum of 4,358,1401.
while on the orhcr hand, the cash and hul
-1 lion in the bank have increased toan4imoiint
Here than .five timei the value of that at
\vh;t
Nvfiith they ftojJ on tlie fame 2 Jtbl of Feb
-rdary iaft, arid ipuch above that at wnie'ti
they fiave fldod at any time firicc the begin
wing of September, 1 795!
Your committee further'find, that the
course of exchange with Hamourg is at pre
f<nt unuftially favourable to this country**
and that from the situation of our trade,
there is good reason to imiagine it will so
continue, unless,. political - circumstances
should occur to afFeft it.
Your committee next preceeding to Â»*s
miiie the governor and deputy-governor of
the ba;ik, as to their opinion of the" incon
veriences which may have arisen from the
reftrl&frm imposed on the bank for making
payment in cash, and for the expediency of
continuing fueh reftn'&ion: i* your commit
tee find that they arc not aware of any such
inconvenience, and that they are supported
in that idea by knowing that the bankers
and traders of London, who had a right by
the a&s of Parliament to demand three
fourths of any deposit in cash which they
had made in the bank of 500!. or upwards
have, only claimed about one-sixteenth.-
And your committee find that the court of
dire&ors of the bank did on the 26th of
Oftofcer, 1797, come to refolutioH, a copy
of which is lubjoined to this report.
Your committer having further examined
the governor and deputy-gove inlor, as to~
what may be meant by the political circum
stances mentioned in tliÃt resolution, find,
' that they understand by them the state of
j hoftilityin which the nation is fliH involved
i and particularly such appreheiifrons as may
' be entertained of invasion" either in Ireland
; or this country ; together with the poSi'bi
lity there may be of advances being to be
madu from this country to Ireland ; and
that from those circumstances so explained,
and from the nature of the war, and the
avowed purpose of the enemy to attack
this country by means of it's pnbile credit,
and to' distress it in its financial operations,
they are led to think that it will he expedi
ent to continue the reftriÂ£lion now subsisting,
with the refervs for partial iffues'of cash, at
the discretion of the bank, of the nature of
that contained in theprefent ails : and
it may be so continued without injury to the
credit of the bank, and with advantage to
the nation.
Your committee therefore having taken
into confederation the general situation of
country, are of opinion, that uotwithfland
. ing the affairs of the bank, both with refpeA
to the general balance of its accounts, and
its capacity of making payments in specie,
are in such a state that it mjght with fafety
refuriWts accuflomed fun&ion3 under a dif
ferent state of public affairs, yet, that it
will be 'expedient to continue the reftrifli
ons now subsisting on such payments, for
such time, and under such limitations, as
to the wisdom of Parliament r*ay seem fit.
Copy of a Resolution. of the Court of DiriSort
of the Batik.
At a Court of Direftors at' the Bauk, on
Thursday, 26th oÂ£t. 1-797.
Refolded, That it iÂ» the opinion of this
Court, that Hhe Governor and Company
of the Bank of England, a're enabled to
tffue specie in any manner that maybe deem
ed necessary for the accommodation of the
public and the Court have no helitation to
declare, that the affairs Oi the Bank are in
such a state, that it can with fafety resume
its accuflomed funftions, if the political
eiretimftances of the country cjo not render
it inexpedient : But the DireSors deeming
it foreign td their province to judge of these
points, wish to submit to the wifdons of
Parliament, whether, as it has ones been
judged proper, to lay a on the
payments-os the Bank in cash, it may or
may not be prudent to continue the fame.
THE BANK MEOTJN.G.
Yesterday a eourt of the proprietors was
held at the bank, and we have particular fa
tisfacHon in annouueingthe proceedings that
pafTed.
Mr. Raikes, the chairmaii, acquainted
. 'the proprietors, that he and the deputy go
vernor had had an interview onthe preced
ing (J-y with Mr. Pitt, and had also depos
ited with the secret committee of the house
of commons, a statement of the affairs of
the Bank, which he ihould also lay before
the proprietors.
Mr. Raikes then informed the court, thai
the miniftev had proposed to extend the far
ther limitation of the tinje when the bank
fhouli resume its payments in fpipcie;, that it
was not necessary for him to judge of the
r urgency of political motives, which might
render such a step advisable ; but he had the
pleasure to inform the court, that the bank
was in such * state of afHuence, as to be
ready to pay all the demands off it in specie,
whenever called upon. '' ' '
The content of the Proprietors was then
asked for advancing the amount of the Land
and. Malt Tax to Government} amounting
! to 2,75,0001. which%vÂ»s ynanimoufly agreed 1
to. â¢
The btifinefs or the mesting being being
