22d, 1796.
" ! confefs I like France wonderfully, particu
larly Parisâalthuugh it must be allowed that here
the moral duties, such as religion, chastity, &c. _
are laughed at. Amusement and present enjoy
ment is fought after by all ranks and agesânever*

time may be eaf;ly and innocently enjoyed, lecon
ciles one fhortiy, perhaps too foou, to the abfencc
of those mote futeran duties, which educttion l.ja
fixed in the mind. Religion, 'tis true, is no more I
ehaflity is tare ! honefly is divided by felf-intrreil J
âall that remains of the fit ft is fixed internally,
but externally destroyed 1 the fecend may be found,
but the public practice of it, even in appcarance,
j would be ridiculous, because the triumph of nature
I is conCdertd as that of reaf,n âand difhonetly is
- every where guarded by cunning or pru
j dence. The absence then of thrfe virtues is not
I looked upon as injurious to society, and on the o
ther hand every creature being in pursuit of what

S ' ter of 11s concern to others, what rhay btT my pur

" The rapid fuccefles of the republic absolutely
5. dazzles the imagination, and would be held roman

, The brilliant exploits of Buonaparte, for rapidity,

conquering Italy, in less time than a coniioiflcuf

(hort time, the extensive gallery of paintings will
contain innumerable testimonies to posterity, of

Latest Foreign Intelligence.
By the James, Copklin, at Ncv/-York
from London, in 19 days, we have
English papers to Sept. 10. Selec
tions follow.
LONDON, September 7.
By the dispatches received from Mr. Hiroir.ond, we
leirn, that his million has failed in toto ; the king of
IVuilia. having Hot only rejected the proposal made to
him 4>y our court, which went to guarantee to him
certain very important territories and a tta-pÂ»rt, but
received Mr. Hammond in the mojt 1:1.1 mur 1
This is an insult not to be wondered at, after submitting
to such an humiliation, as to apply to that very powir
which deceived us, broke faith with us, and cheated
us of our money.
The object of Mr. Hammond's million isfaid to been
'Vtvo-fbld: firft, to aftertiin the final dete min.ition of
the l'rench poveniment on the conditions of peace
and secondly, if that determination Ihould prove to be
such as to render the continuation of the war inevita
ble, to detach the Prufiian monarch from hi? alliance
with the French, and to induce nim to rejoin that con
federacy which he w*s the firft to eftablilh, and the
firft to clelert. In both these points,-Mr. Hammond has
completely failed ; and the failure has jullified the ap
prehensions of thof : who were capable of forming any
judgment of the present slate of contiaental affairs.
Some of our politicians are now convinced of what
they ought to have seen long agÂ«, that the royal plan- !
derer of Poland is determined to take every possible ad
vantage of the ? empcror's diftrefled situation. The
petty Hates too, at least as many as are within his power
will foot! participate in the blessings of his pater iul care
and afteifhbn.
The demands of the French diredtory, as communi
cated through nur late faithful ally, are laid to be such
as might be expcifled through such a channel, tn fa<sl,
the- go c'early to provecnepf two thingsâeither that
PrullVa is not the channel by which negociations at all
JionoOrJble tr. this country can be carried on ; or, that
that the direflory w ill hot, through any foreign medi
um, treat with our present miniitry. We pretend ivit
to determine wfcich of these i< the facSl.
Mr. Hammond, after fending the meflen
ger, to Vienna, with the result of his conferences at the
court of Prussia, is himfelf on his return to Loudon,
and may be daily expelled.
The emperor, we are told, is determined to defend
his dominif>Â» .ro the last. It is natural he fhou'd do so ;
but it is conlidently reported, that he has no intention
to carry or) the war any lon'ger ; that he now labours to
givepeaceto his dominions by a treaty with the French j
and that, if nothing unforefeen retard the negociati
ons, a peace between these two powers will be cun
eluded before tb| end of next month.
William Swift, a man of 93 years ps ag_e, was late
ly committed to the house of corre&ion, at York, in
order to take his trial at the next feffiois, for aflaulting,
with intent to ravijb, three girls, the eldcft of whom is
not twelve years old.
The emoluments of the offices held by the late earl

One of the most firople and ufefnl difceveri'es in
Agriculture, comprehending pasturage, is to mix
green, or new cut clover, with layeis Â»f lfr&w,in ricks

is absorbed by the 'straw, which, thus impregnated,
both horses and cattle eat greedily ; shd thus the clover
is dried, and prevented from heating. This pra&ice

Brutal Outrage at Yarmouth,
Mr. Thelwail, who has been for some tiifie delivering z
Course of Lectures on Civil Hiftorv, and particularly on the
laws and revolutions ol Rome, at Norwich, rec. ived a lUong
invitation frotn (everal of the rincipal inhabitant* of Yai

the invitation.
On theftfftand second nights, a oarty was formed, con

employed to look after the emigrants, and a hangerou or
two (place expe&ants) of government, who attempted to

Uoys without, irrigated by a naval officer, wno offered them
five guiueas if they wodÂ»d pull down the hou s e, co-operatea

they were capable of making. The difturbfrs, novtfever.

proceeded for some time with the utmost trartqnillky j but
about eight o'clock a banditti, con filling of upwards of sixty
faTltfrs, amjfcl with blui?-eons, who came on fliore (evident

In spite of the delay which his obitinacy caused to

The indirect attempt of minifiers to negociate with

Mr. Hammond's interview with the king of Prnflia,

government, but upon the French nation at large, es
pecially when it i considered that the executive direc
tory, (owing to the j#-feit ruinous Hate of their
finances, and the diftrefled condition of their affairs,
independent of the recent check they have experienced
in Germany J ruiiif be as anxious to bring the war to
a speedy termination, as either of the powers with
whom they have to contend. Of thr Mature of the

MANY further similar illtiftrations .miglit be
made of ibe ex-fecretary'aphilofophical talents from
his note: on Virginia ; ttiefe may for the present fuf
fice. At a future opportunity, we may find lelfure
to notice his very extraordinary penal code, and his
whimfica) system of retaliation, his wife attempt to
refute the account of the deluge, (evidently stated
by Moses to be a miracle) by a recurrence to philo
sophical an<J merely natural principles ; and sundry
other philosophical ;ibfurdiiieÂ«. His plagiary report
on weighs and measures will be adverted to under
another head.
After these specimens of his talents, these elaba
rate prodnfliors of his mind, we may fafcly ven
ture to vr'hbold from Thomas Jefferfon the title of
philosopher.
But we fhotild incur no danger in yielding tohi9
rlaim in ihe rullelt extenr, brcaufe it mill be obvi
ouc to tie plsineft twderftandings, and to men of
the fmallcft experience in public life, that of all be
ingi, a philosopher, makea the word politician, that
if an}- one circumitince more than another, could
difqiialify Mr. Jefferfon for thcJPrefidency, it would
be the charge of his being a philosopher. Not be
lieving him to possess any thing more than the majk
of my objeftinn to his election would
certainly not reft on that ground ; but as there tmy
be some, who, having read his works fuperficially,
may have been deceived by that character, which is (
fometicnes acquired, because no one has been at the
trouble to feminize and (trip it of its borrowed (
garb, to them 1 lepeat that, admitting him to be a
molt learned philosopher, such a character alone
creates his difquallfication for the Prelidency.
In turning over the-page of history, we find it j
teeming with evidences Â«f 'he ignorance and mif
manr.gement of philosophical politicians. The
great Locie was employed to frame a cojillitution
for Catolina ; but it abounded so much with regu
lations, TTTjrfpficaMe ttrthe (fate of things for which
it was designed, so full of tfuszclic wfumfiu, that
it was soon thrown aside. Condorcet, a particulrr
friend of our American philosopher, was a great
Frtnch philosopher, his constitution of 1793, con
tains more ibfurdities than were evtr before piled
up in any fyftesn of Government ; it was (j radi
cally defeÂ£tive that its operation was never even at
tempted ; Condorcet's political follies, and the
wretched termination of his career are well known ;
ha bad philosophy enough to know how to raise a
storm, but not enough to avert its effcÂ£iÂ«. The af
fairs of France have lince been mure ably condudted
(except during the fliort arifloctacy of Robespierre)
by men who aÂ« good politicians, but fortunately
for France, not philosophers.
Rittenhoufe was a great philosopher, but thÂ« only
proof we have had of his political talents was his
fuffering himfelf to be wheedled into the Presidency
of the Democratic Society of Philadelphia, a fo
iiety wilh which he was even alhamed to associate,
tho' cajoled and flattered into the loan of his name..
Many other in/lances might be adduced.
The charaflereftic traits of a philosopher, when
be turns politician are, timidity, whimficalnefs, a -
â fcifpofif i'tri to f<H>m ceiiait) a lid~
not from the true nature of man, a pronenefs to
predicate all his measures on certain theories, fortn
â ' fd in the recess of his cabinet,and not, as they ought
to be, on the existing state of thinjiÃ and circum
fiance* ; an inertness cf mind, as applied to go
vernmental policy, a wavering of disposition when
great and sudden emergencies demand promptness
of decision and anergy of aflion. If the laws are
eppofed and infurreflion raises its crest, the insur
gents will always calculate on the weakness [and in
dtcifionof the executive (if a philosopher) and they
will be juftific'd in their calculations, for he will he
sitate till all is loft ; be will be wandering in the la
byrinth* of philosophical speculations, moralizing
on the fin of spilling human blood, and Foolishly per
fuaditig himfelf that maukii.d can always be re
claimed and brought back to their duty by whole
some advice. His mind will be constantly attraft
td to his favorite purfnits, and his prefix en tial du
ties, of course, be postponed to more pleasing avo
cations.
Let us suppose one ol these exploring and pro
found philosophers defied President of the United
States, and a foreign minister, on Ims firft introduc
tion inter hi* cabinet, surprizing hi|i in the aft of
infpefting the Ji'tn and the scars Jim of a black and
a white pig, in order to discover the causes of dif
ference which nature has in their Â«folour, j
or with the fame view anatomizing the kidnies and
glands of a Negro to ascertain the nature of his se
cretions ?. Would not the minister's firft observation
be, that the philosopher would be much better em
ployed, in-his retirement at home, and his second,
that such a President would furnifh excellent ma
t terials for him to make use of ?
What refpeft would the officers of government
. entertain for a president, whom they should find, on
waiting on him for inftruftions, that he wasbufily
engaged in impaling a butteifly or contriving with
assiduous perfcverancean*eafychairof newconftrnc
tion ? Would not an attention to these littlenefTes
make him the ridicule of the world ? The great
Washington was, thank God, no philosopher ;
had be heeu one, we should never have seen his
great military exploits ; we (bould never have prof
p"red urdei bis wife administration. There is ano
ther chara&eriftic tiarit in philosophers highly dan
gerous, namely, their extreme openness to fatterJ, ;
a ftarteier will be always sure to gaifc a phi ofophei's
affeflions; n philosophical president will be eonfe- j
quently most influenced by that nation which flat
ters n.ofl-; which that is, need not be mentioned :
if tbfir agents do not fail in this national qualifica
tion, such a president will be their most devoted
servant : he will also be perpetually surrounded by
.a (warm of domestic flatterers; and as they are
generally the hafeft of charaders, the companions
he will be attached to, and the meafu'es they will
promote, may without be predided.
* Who hasnot heard from the Secretary the praises of
hÂ» wonderful' Whirligig Chair, which had the miraculous
quality of allowing the pt rfon seated in it to turn his cad,
without moving his tail? Who has not admired his fei*ile
genius in the production of his Epicurcaa fide-besrd, and
other Gim Krackery ? ]

5 B-tt althnu s fh I hare thus denied to Mr. Jeffer- !
son the title of a real philosopher, I am ready to
dllow that he poffefTrs the inferior cliarafteriHics,
and the externals of philosophy. To a mind, ana
>c bitieus of pafiing with the world for a philosopher,
T 1 the firft were easily acquired, the last as eaftly as
sumed. The inferior charafterifticras applied to
. e the science of politics, are a want of steadiness, a âº
18 conftitnticrtial tndtcifion and versatility, vifioriary,
Â° wild and fpeculalive systems, and rations other de
feflive features, which have been already pourtray
edâlndeed so unsettled ,is the mind of n ivoifld ie
' philosopher, so capricious and vcrfatile are the prin
' ciples of these philosophical mimics, that they at
r tempt to reconcile the most irreconcilable theories,
and to juitify'the most incoafiftent ads by the fame
Itar.dard. Thiii you will find these pretenders to
P philosophy, at one moment, coolly juftifying the
itiAft attror-ious and far.guinary cruelties, provided
thev are means to a certain favorite end ; at another
S cautiously difiuading from vigorous, the necefTtiy
. measures, left they might fatal], iiTue, in the shed
ding of human blood. Condorcet and Briffet were
like Jefferfort, reputed philosophers; they set up
! certain wild and impra&icable theories of govern
j ment; among them, of course, the emarcipatioa of
the negroes in "the French Weft-Indies, an:), of
[ conrfe, the mafTasrc of tl* whites, and the defola
j of the colonies: this was reprcfented to
them, by a deputation lrom the colonies, warning
r them of the fatal confeqtiences of their principles.
' What was Philosopher Condorcet's reply ? Attend
' to it, Citizens ot the Southern States ! 1 He an
swered with ttue philosophic calmness, " Peri/h all
" the coltnifls, rather than that we should devia'e
one tittle from our principles." This is the enlight
ened Condorcet, to whom bis friend Jefferfon, Simu
lated by a sympathetic philanthropy, sent Bannc
ker's Almanac, as the highest proof of his admira
tion of the Negro's work This is the fame Con
dorcet who could, with calmnef*, fee the colonics
laid waste, and thousands of aged colonics and in
r.oâ-cui Â«ad chililre:i maJTicred, and yet was
peipctually preaching up philanthropy *Â»d untver
fal benevolence. Brijj'oi was much such another
character, tiiay both dcfervedly met the fame fate.
As ignorant people are often imposed upon by
an appearance of philosophy, those, who have am
bitious designs, tcadily alTume its externals â¢ these
consist in a ridiculous affeftaton of limplicity and 1
humility in a thousand frivolities, and little puerile ; 1
tricks, whirhalways render the perfotmer contempt- ! '
ible in the eyes of discerning people, who soon dif- j
cover that under the afTutned cloak of humility, ,
j lurks the most ambitious spirit, the most overween- ,
\ ing pride and hauteur, and that the externals of fim
. plicity and humility afford but a- flimfy veil to the
interna/ evidences of ariftociatic splendor, sensuality
j and epieareanifm.
g Mr, Jefferfon has been held up and cbarafler
_ ized by his friends as " the quiet, model! retiniig
philosopherâas the plain, simple, unambitious re
publican. He shall not now, for the firft time, be
' regarded as the intriguing incendiaryâtheafpiring
turbulent competitor, unless faÂ£ts (hall warrant the
, fuggeltion : of these an enlightened public mull
, j"^e-
I What, if a quirt, raodeit, unambTiicgs phijof >â¢
} plier at a delicate crisis, withdrawing himfelf from
a post of duty, from an alledged attachment to phi
t lofophical pursuits, and a ttrong antipathy to pub
lic honors, should immediately devote his hours of
reti'#ient /Â» mature his schemes Â»f concealed amliti
in, and at the appointed time, come fotth the indif -
â  giufed candidate for the highejl honors, and for the
f most arduous station to which ambition can aspire ?
Would not this trait alone fufSciently m3rk his
character and his views ?
To some few of his fellow citizens, this inay per
haps be thefirjltime his real character has been dis
covered ; but let tLem recollect that there is always
T " a firfl time," when aharafters Uudiou9of artful
* disguises are unveiled, when the vizor of ftoiciftn is
plucked from the brow of the epicurean, when the
, plain of quaker fimplirity ia stripped from thÂ«
concealed voluptuary, when Crfar, coyly refitfin* the
proffered diadem, is found to be Csefar rejeSinf the
