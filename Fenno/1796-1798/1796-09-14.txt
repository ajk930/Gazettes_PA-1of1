overfhet 18 feet wat r wheels, and Evans's machinery _
complete, with every other thing proper and necessary for ot w
. carrying on the bulinefs with dispatch, and at as little es

will then may deliver grain arid take in flour) it is about 40 Qut (
large ya rc!s, and from thence by water frf George Town and . lfc3 .
nges, t }, e City of Washington, about J miles, and to Alexan- j j.- Q[
dria about 11 miles. This situation, aided by a fufficient
capital, will command the produce of a very detenuve
back country, where Urge quantitiss of whrfat a.nd other
"rain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8
to 10 miles less than to any naziket town up in the navi
gation of the Potow ac. There al-e on the premises a
far<re (lone Coopers' (h 3p, a (lone granary, and a coramo
dio'us miller's house. At the landing aforefaid a bridge
is now building overthe Potomac, which is in great for
wardnefs and probably will be ftnithed the er.fumg fall.
There are also on the premises, a Brewery and Distille
ry, built with stone, in them are three stills, two coppers |
' or toilers, with every necessary artickj all new, and in
good order, and f*fficiently large to carry on the Brew- - .
ery and Distillery upon a very extcnfive plan. This prop
Â» erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my lauds adjoining the premises, and along the
banks of the river, 'where craft may lead withe'afe anddif- , p or

' An eftafette. arrived to-day with letters from itÂ«-
\f, and from Trent on the iStli* whfch announces
1 that -flothingof consequence had happened vp to
thÂ« 17th, on which day there was 3 fmil! affuiÂ» at
Monte-Baldo, nearihe Lake of GardS, which cott
. the"f rench zoo in wounded and prifonei s.
Reports upon what lias -parted hefofe Mantua,
fay, that on the 7th and Bth, tjie French ereftcd
p some batteries opposite the gate Molina (on the
road tif Vienna) and Fort St. the road
to Legnano) from which the city is fcparated by
1 a bridge of 27 arches, with three dravr-bridges.â
' The artillery of the fortrefs killed many men ; but
they succeeded in eftablifiiing some mortars and
cannon, which played the next day on the city,
and continued until the 12th, when their ammuni
tion failed them, and they seemed rather to be
making a blockade than a siege.
We learn from Verona on Ihe I jfth, that a great
number of wounded have been brought there ;
the French fuffered mod near the Molina Gate ;
" it appear* they have abandoned it, and now confine
themselves to maintain their position on the point
of St. George, where they do not fear the fellies
as trie gatrifon.
Thi? Florence Gaisette assures us, that the loss of
General Beaulieii on the 30th of May was at lead
7*ooo in killed, wounded, and prifoneri. He lolt
his Camp equipage, his baggage, and his artillery,
and retreated with only 3000 men, and on the road
to Trent. Buonaparte's accounts does not make it
so difaftrcus.
Letters from Piacenja, of th# loth, announce
the continual passing of French Troops to reinforce
General Buonaparte s 400Â© men went by on t'ne
7th, and 7000 were expedted from Tortftna, roak
ing probably part of Kellerman's army.
HERMANSTADT (Hungary) June 11.
As the Grand Seig?iior heard of the suc
cesses of th? French in Italy, he sent a courier to
Vienna to allure t'!ie Emperor of his pacific dis
position. The Emperor in consequence has drawn
all his troops from the frontiers of the Turkish
dominions, to fend them to the Rhine and to Italy.
The Grand Seignior is fuppafed to have pursued
this coHtiuft with the view of deceiving h : e Impe
rial Majesty ; for he is afiembling large numbers of
troops on the German frontiers, under pretext of
quelling a pretended rebellion of the Pacha of Wid
din, and the fortrefs of Belgrade never was better
furnifiied with troops and proviiions ; so that it is
really fuppSfed the Turks are only amusing the
Court of Vienna, in order that they may attack it
with the greater advantage."

FROM THE MINERVA.
! POLITICAL TANATICISM.*
* nIT i3 c ne Â° f the strangest truths, if that can be
b Jltange which is very tomrmn, that men are never at
f a lois for good exi.afcs, to apologize and jullify all,
\ their deteltable conduct.
t When vhe British commandos in America want
cd to vent their spite and vengeanee againfl the A
mencans, for rcfiflhrg the tyranny ot their govern-
J rnent, ihey fixed on them the odious epithet of R t
- M, which, according to thÂ»honourable fa-uage laws,
3 ol war, juftified a greater degree of ieventy to
"-els them, than towards other enemies. This
, r wat a. very convenient apology for starving Ameri
e can pufoiifis, (tabbing them, j'nfuiting them, freez
t ing tâem, and crouding them by thousands into
r holds of ffUps, to WtÂ«cd itif c^ion , and perish by re
- giments. r 1
i 1 his also was their excitfe for burning towns,lay
â¢ ing waftc the 6e!os, and abusing the helpless inha
j bitantaâ..old men, women and children. Com
i plaints that such treatment was contrary to the laws
e o- war, were answered with, " You are damned
- rebelsâit is good enough for you 1"
, When the queen regent of the Guises in Friince
, bore a spite against their rivals, the great Conde,
- Congni, and their party, and wiflied ;o get rid of;
- Jhera, they called in the cause of God and holy re
s 'gion to jullify their villainous measures. Their
1 ccs were proteflant; and h;reU:sâto murder them !
- ' would be doing Ofid service. This roused the pal
ions of their fanatic followersâ" Come, let ns a

i fatal tJrd-r was tfiven, and thirty thufu-.

When Peter ;hc Hermit vha fcir?

June 16, to the Italian*.
. " A misled multitude, whd hare no real means of

Observe, reader, the French genera! callsthepÂ«o>

fully ascribe their.resistance to delujion.
But, fays B uÂ«n apart e, these people have no rej

ricans, and I'aidfo Gage, Howe and Clin:o:i. " It
vÂ£aÂ» impuiftble to relist the Bri.ilh forces andmarf.
nefsito attempt it." But the Ftench geuerallhould
reflect, thav if the people*have no meifls of de
fence, there is no glory in conquering them, but a
gt-eat deal of meanneft in infultwg and opprejjing
them.
And what have these mijled people done I for, if
m'tjled, they are not crim unl, and dclerve tu pu
nilbment. Why, tliey rtjuje to acknoiuieJgc tht rf
public. A horrid crime thi6, not to like ihen'Â«on<

leege the authority of parliament to l/rnd tk<m in all
cafet -whatfeever. They w filled the iiruilh force*
âthey would not, sr.d did not itibmii. After a
good deal of trouble, we got rid of parliament, feÂ»
neralt and troops, and jull so the ppople of Inly
will do, with the French.
" But, fays Buonaparte, these people " iatdJcÃ >

Ah, here the proud despot comes oijt. Â®tati

and nobles J Alloni/hing inl'nlence ! The very name
of filch a brave set "f fellows ought la infpiityo#
with terrorâyou ought ta fall down and Motlkip

" The 'insanity of tbefe people, fay* Buoiupartt,

happy under French government, lhit demand)ill
the raorey, proviftuns and horses, necefary to tup

The following extract from Beaumont'* travels j
through the Rhstian Alps,is the more inteieftiug,
as Tyrol is probably in a considerable degt.ee the
theatre of war.
" The Tyrolefe in general, as well at mod of .
the inhabitants of the Alps, are not opulent, yet j
there are scarcely any poor among them. I have
travelled through several of their vallies, which ex
tend upwards of ten miles, and have not found tbt
leafl appearan&eof wrctcheSneft. Each individual J
cultivates his own land j and when that is not fuffi j.
ent for the maintenance of his family, he has re
cotirfe to that industry and a&iyity natural to them
all; and endeavors to procure work in the mines,
or different manufactories': if not fuccefsftil, they
juit 1 ytol in the quality of Hawkers, and convey 1
jnto other countries the produce of their own. 1
Such are the little pleasurable barters of ljfe, when
life is governed by fimpliciiy alone, and the eftima
tion in which objeifts are held is only proportioned '
to their real utility. c
" he 1 yrolefe are tall, flrong and robust, as '
mountaineers are in generalâremarkable for chear-
fulne ?, with great mildness and honesty of cha c
rafter:, but keen with an uncommon (hate of un
derftanding. They all Roman Catholics, ajd 1
extremely devout, placing not only :n the roads . j
but on their habitations, a number of images ac- '
cording, to tbe forms of their religion ; jet the ge 1
nerality of them are not bigots, for they rppcar to
tftecm indiscriminately all ftrangcfj who visit them, '
without attending to their different opinions pn rr '
Kgionâlike most mountaineers, they are particu- '
larlyattached to their prince and to their cotlntry. '
Happy people, your morals are as ptire at your c
ideas are innocent t 1
"I" ihort, whether we consider the inhabitants *
of these haj py regions, or the 'country it fell, a '
tiavelle* will not find it easy perhaps to visit any '
spot where, more circumttances concur to gratify a 1
a love of natural history, to enlarge the mind, or '
to interest the feelingc.

to a very refpetta'ule house in this city, written cn e

pily removes the impressions firll made by tbe above 3
' intelligence. /,
It appears that the disputes, said to have oecafi- '
oned the dillurbance, oiiginated in an oppolition '
by manyj of the garrison tllablilhtd tu Curacoa t
against the haw order of things as lately adopted i& *
Holland j and a refufal of the officers to take the
