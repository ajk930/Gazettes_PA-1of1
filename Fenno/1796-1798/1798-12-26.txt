h THAT your Memorialists, since ;
their incorporation, employing their bed skill, [
assisted by an able and experienced engineer, j
have, to the utm.ift extent of their resources, t
1 and with all diligence', exerted themil-lves in
it, J the prolbcution of the great work committed
rs, to their management, and have, from time to a
ch time, communrcated, to tlw Legislature and e
a ' their fellow-citizcns, its gradual prog rets, and
o ' the difEculties they have labored under from j
â d sundry caul'es ; the chief of which have been, tj
le the great increase in the price of labor, a
growing scarcity of money, and more par-
ticularly the liberty aliowei by law, even for a
solvent (bareholders, to refufe payment and
IC forfeit their lharcs, when they get dilcourag- | t |
ed or diffatisfied with the avork, under an j t i
â - apprehension that it cannot be completed k
:r within the time prelcribed in the Act ; and r,
that it is better to forfeit* part of their in
terest early, than to forfeit their whole rights w
and privileges to tiie Legiflatare at Islt, if j
I, the Cannl Ihould not be completed at the ex- J.
piration of 10 years from the date of the w
ad, which will be on April 10th 1802.
i To those communications, remaining u .
among your files, and for the most part col- j p i
lefted and laid before the public, in a largt !
printed pamphlet, your memorialists again m
â¢ pray attentiofi, and particularly to the ad- y
| uress and petition presented early in the last t j,
1 feflions of the Legislature ; which has an t h
immediate connexion with that important ft,
objeft, then and now claiming the mcfl feri- i i n
ouspublic confideraticr.ânamely "the means ' p c
ot introducing a copious fupplv of water in- v ij
to our city and suburbs, as weil for culinary bv
. uses, as for cleansing our flreets, the extin- . th<
guishment of fire, and for Fountains and Re- tu
serooirs, tending both to ornament, health, . t h,
and a purer atmofpljere, in the dry and warm Dri
seasons."
an
\our memorialirts, by fiction 3d and 4th evi
of their aft of incorporation, are authorised o n
and empowered, by means of the said Canal, flu
" to supply the city of Philadelphia and its die
neighborhood, with water" (for the aforefaid tu:
purposes) "at limited prices, in proportion fpg
to the capital to be expended on the work ; â 
and, for that end, to take as much wat;r up ,
from the river Schuylkill at, or within a mile 1 m c
below the mouth ol Stony Creek, as 1
through a â aiater-v.'cy of thirty feet 1a width;" i jr. ,
and also, ii any lower Cut between I3ela- ! noj
ware and Schuylkill, for the general purposes j f or
ol the works, be necellary near the city, they 1 a ;f,
are veiled w.th power " to take water from j St.
any of the ft reams lying between the

That the act of incorporation was found
ed chiefly on the statement of a previous act
iuroey and level, made from Philadelphia to tWÂ£
Nornftown at private expence, with a view Teo
city, and finding a point in t} Â£
cbujiKtil, from which a supply of water mo
might be carried to the highest part in the f ua .
ground plots ot the city and its suburbs, ade- t ; t ,
yute to all the purposes contemplated for hav
health, use and ornament upon any probable cu j.
increalc of inhabitants for generations yet defi

moflj the various methods which have bern
for introducing a fufikient quan

have appeared to your coremittee so well cal
culated to ensure the attainment of that
deGreable objeft, as the completion of tbt De
la-ivart and Schuylkill Cam!; That imprrlTed
with this beliet, and convinced that the pro
fccution of this objeft, would rjfo contri
bute to aid the great and important under
taking of tnlj7id navigation as this canal
forms a capital link In the great chain of na
vigation between our mttropolis, and the
Ohio and the western lakes they conficered
that in addition to contributing to th;
health of the community, they would en
creafe the prosperity of the city by taking
eiiediual measures for accompliiliing thisur*
dertaking in which opinion the taÂ»aUorÂ»-
mittee could not but heartily concur;âmo ft
especially as the introducing a copious fuj
ply of water into the citv and its fuburbr,
was one of the chief objeiit of our iacorpiÂ»
ration ; upon which object, in order to coi -
ftru& the canal upon a level and of dhze; -
stons fufEcient for accommodating the ci;y
and suburbs with water (to the amount cf
half a million of cubic feet pfrhour) a fcm
has been already expended, at least equal to
what the canal for the purposes of navigation
alone would have coil ; and tlicrtf>rc that
the double object of watering the city, and
compleating the canal as a great link of na
vigation for the special bencÂ£t cf the Â«Â£Â»
as well, as of our general country ccmn'crteÂ»
ought not to be separated; and indeed, in
the belief of your memorialists, cÂ»nr.ot be
leparated, as no other fonrce, except from
Schuylkill as high as Stone creek, can be
found for the ut ceflary quantity of water ;
and if such neceflary quantity could be found
by the junftion of various other dreams, the
cost would far exceed that of introducing 'â !
water by means of tliat canal, and occasion
a great lot's of time, in exploring new sour
ces, when an obvious plan is at hand, and
half compleated at the cost of tl* (locilwU

SAMUEL WYLIE.
December 13, 1798, j
[So much for Mr. Samuel Wiley, whom '<
I fufpeÂ£t my readers will find much less wily '<
:han he thinks himfclj. Like his profound
compeers, he begins bv inveighing a"ainft
, my virulent abuse of United Irishmen, ra y
â¢ calumnies," my Â»'malite and ill-natnre â¢
but while these have ck.fed tlieir juftif.cations
'>y extolling views the imputation of which
:o themselveS they had to esteem ta
lumnious, citizen Wiley contents him with ,
barely expieffing hiÂ« fupreine indi/errnt â¢ to
â¢hat very (ideal) Charge, Which fie lit Out by
tyling virukntly abedive, ill-natured and
â :aliciot;S.
He foiemnly declirea he never was in any
Society of United Irifhmeti in America.
Why wtre th*fc two last laitcriog words
lugKtd in so la in cly f Tf he was an United
Iriihman in Ireland, and remains a difaffcÂ«a.
Ed liilhman in America, it mult require
more caijor than he cabs for, to believe
:hat he is " privy to none of their dtfn- nr."
I now no longer iietibl him an United
Iriihman. He. is Â« altogether indiflereiif:
wliether I believe him one or not, and 1
â hiflis. he will find it n-xeiiary to extend his
indifference to the public also; for I verilv J
think, they wih lomehow or other-take uj
the fame odd opinion.
Aniidft all the afte&ed insolence of these
people, I discover tlie mcft abjeft seci âand vt
that kind of fear, too, which is the invaria
ble attendant of g-.ult. What they shguld
heaven knows, as heaven knows that
tt~ey are honest, <tvi:e and virtuous. What
th ey should fear from a government which -
never whirled its impetuous rota over the
body of one innocent man, (but eolctul M:t
tbew Lyon) ; what tre.y should fear under
a go\-eriunent, which would ftuver to flinders
like a Laphrd palace of ice, at the fir ft in
stance of opprriiion on an honest man ; what Â£
TRtY should fear in a country-where there- oi
of origin, and the temper cf all qt
political iÂ»ftjtu.tit>:n, add>-<2 to an humane 1
eifpi fttion to con ciiler.'.te misfortune when a '

Lit they are disjointed in tbeir man. Mr. ,f
as Brown has proved by his votes, that he re- B

at ways believed him,tp. be, an honest American
0 r devoted to no party. |
et When our jacobins- found his name Hon
