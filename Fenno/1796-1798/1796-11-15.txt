THE French are devilsâdevilsâdown right devils;

Rogues that convert the fined flour to bran;
In Vice's drunken eup forevÂ»r guezling ;
, z jj' Just like the hogs in arod uncleanly nuzzling.
I know the rascals a lin is Utto,
To rels the holy Latfy of Loretto;
Attack her temple with (heir.guns, so warrifc,
And thrust the genrlewoman on the parilh ;
>â¢ A Lady all so graceful, gay, and rich,
With gems and wonders lodg'd in every stitch.
, Heir of St. Peter, Jcindle then thine Ire,
And bid France feel thy apostolic fire ;
Think of the quantity of sacred wood
Thy treasuries can launch into'the flood ;
What (hips the holy nwntrer can create
v At leaff a dozen of the largest rate!
And, 10, enough of sweet Saint Martha's hair.
To rig this dozen mighty (hips of wir.
Our Saviour's pap-spoon, that,a world adores,
Would make x hiincired thousand pair of oars.
Gather theftones that knock'd fiownpoor St. Stephen,
"And fling at Frenchmen in the name of heav'n; ,
Bring forth the thousands of Saint Catherine's Bails, ,
That ev'ry convent, church and chapel hailsâ
atf For fterms, -uncork the bottled sighs of martyrs,
â¢^ v And blow the rogue's to earth's remotell quarters. '
Such relics, of good mother church the pride,
ilfo ow wo "ld they currycomb a Frenchman's hide! i
ind Son-os the church, again I fay, arise, ;
r i And flafli new marvels in their sinner eyes-; 1
With teeth and jawbones on thy holy back,
Thumbs, fingers, "knuckle-bones to fill a sack;
â With joint of rump, ind loins, and heels, and toes, j
Begin thy march, and meet thy atheist foes.
Struck with a panic (hall the villains leap, 1
And fly thy presence like a flock of sheep. I
Thus ftial! the rebels to religion yield, 1

len, WE (hall now examine the tendency of the rem.
mercialmeafuris, which Mr. Jefferfon recommended â >
l ''*> toeongrefsin his report. â
In the 17th page he fays, "Where a nation :
imposes high duties or our productions, and pro- 1
hibits them altogether, it may be proper to do the '
fame by theirs, firft burthening or excluding those '
productions which they bring here in competition
with own of the fame kind ; f-leCtmg next
such manufactures as we take fiom them in great if! '
quantity, and which at the fame time we could the 1
' soonest furnith to ourselves, or obtain from other '
countries, imposing on them duties lighter at firft, 1
but heavier and heavier afterwards, a* other chan- 1
nels of supply open." He had pievioufly dated, c
that Great-Britain did impose high duties on some F
of our productions, and prohibited others altoge- 1
ther: he afterwards stated, that Great-Britain was 1
unwilling to enter into any friendly arrangements ?
! with us. The propositions introduced by Mr. Ma- ''
difen, of which citizen Fauchet fays Mr. Jefferfon ?
was thereal author, and which were in faCt a com- "
,r [fi mentary on the report, were direCtly aimed ,at the w
manufactures of Great-Britain. 3
ed- Had it been true, that Great-Britain had bur-
â¢*e dened our productions in the maaner stated in the J e
i'at reprrt, we should have been warranted by juflice,
ecÂ» and the principles of [elf protection, in reciprocating n
en- burdens on their manufactures, and we should have 0
al been warranted by policy also, could we have found Ci
Jc " a fubflitute for their manufactures. But inafmucli d
'â an jas the commercial system of Great-Britain, so far f
of j from exhibiting those hidious feature/ which the re- ' r
to port had pourtrayed, was found, on examination, tc
er- to be at lead as friendly to us as that of any other ' e
?as country, the meaftire was condemned by juflice; and
ces inafmueh as we could, at that time, find no pofiible
iÂ» fubflitute for the British manufactures, it was also
>d, condemned by policy. PÂ«
ir- j There could be only three sources of supply ,l
'as to this countiy of the manufactures annually con- Bl
â¢ fumedâthe United States,Great-Britain & Franee. fa
if-1 1 he- United States manufacture but little. Manu- I"
at faCtures cannot thrive to any extent ia a Country 8r
lly I like this. Mr. Jefferfon, in deprecating their exif- to
'0 I tence among us, gives himfeff fufficient reasons, in
ie- J his Notes 011 Virginia, why they cannot ptofper.
he Experience has fanftiooed his doCtrrae. The cloth in
en manufacture in Connecticut, the cotton manufac-' 0,1
11- J ture at Paterfon, notwithstanding the auspicious
ay patronage under which the latter has been fortcred, "
ig and varies other attempts, have all failed j aud * r
ie. this will universally be the cafe, until, as Mr. Jcf. *'
er ferfon observes, men get piled up in large cities
oH throughout America, But, while land is in such hi :
P len, y> an <| Workmen so scarce, and of course so tu
n- dear, in vain shall government, unwisely, heap duty J c
a- \ upon duty, and burden upon burden, on foreign
so manufactures, we (hall (till, for years to come, be co
Â»f obliged to resort to them. Of what avail have
f been all the protecting duties on cottons, on hard- UD
c- ware &c. &c. ? Do ive find them imported ia lcfÂ« 10
id quantities? Let every reader look at his own dress, ha
m 8t ,hc furniture and implements with which, he ! ,c
ie is urrounded, and then pionousce what portion of ' nt
I tncra 11 derived from domed ic resources. to
e J eflrerfon ftatC! 3 in the leport, that even do
m of the rough material of bar-iron, we do not make W
enough for our own confutation. He had also wil
Rated, that while the manufactures we imported ! P rc
u from From and her dominion, amounted to only I
2,068,348 dollar., those from Great-Britain and I tra
l hcr XT dom ! n 'Â° n Â» amounted to 15,285,428 dollars. j cce
Notwithstanding this iramenfe disproportion, he oth

fo tures of France, about the very period, when Mr. '
t y Jcfferibn and his partizans were ttriving to iubjedt
?B this country altogether to a dcpendancc on French
commerce and French manufactures.
ve '1 he object of Mr. Jefferfon's report was then
( j_ undoubtedly to cncouragc and give a new spring
to the languithing manufactures of France. We,
fs, ave s een what was their fiuiatioii about the time
| |e he sent in his report ;no one, acquainted with the
0 f interest which he took in every thing which related
to France, and with his means of information can
!n doubt his being well apprized of that lituatiun.
ce Where can a jultificatioo then be found, confident
so a due regard of our national welfare, for hit
proposed fvilcm ?
ly squires little knowledge of the couife of
1( j trade, to be convinced that his scheme, had it fuc
| ceeded, would have been attended with one or
le i Â°?' lcr these coalequencesâeither it would have
s _ : operated as a bounty, paid by "the citizens op
j the united states for the revival of the ceoi

'â¢ ' ' ie foregoing conliderations are fufficient to
1- <ifliibit the ruinous and difgraceful tendency of Mr.

C ,
t An abftrafl of this report was pubiifhed in Mr.
1 Bache. piper of the 13th December, 1794. and the
f report idelf appeared in Webftei's Herald of 7th March,
f Â»795-
. We have from time to time been entertained, even

_ Whenever the merchants have supported a measure,
â  : w nth did notfuit thc view* of a certatin party, they

<I l. c^ rl,rilerc '-'' speech, fpeikingot our merchants,fays,
mere arc the rtrougclt reaibns not to follow the
. mercajtile opinion in this country ; it raijjht be the
Cptnion of the very country of which we uo; to
take C6OB&IJ' See tpÂ« c \ p . 6a . *and prove without difficulty that It w#uld hÂ»ve o- >
perated injurioufi), in all those relationi. With
out this detail, we may fafely pronounce that,
whatever might have been the motives of Mr. Jef
ferfoa, the operation of this project would hive
been a phenomenon in politics and tradeâa go
vernment attempting to aid commerce by throwing
it intt confujionâby obJlruÃing the mod elTeatial
channels in which it flowed, under the pretence of
making it flow man freely, by damming up the bell
outlet for our surplus commodities and the belt inlet
fÂ«r the supplies which we wanted, by disturbing a
beneficial course of things, in an experiment, pre
carious, if not dtfpetate, by arrelting the current j,
of a prosperous and progreflive navigation, to tranf
fer it to other countries, and by making all this R
mid <a>ori in the criminal attempt to build up the
mailt)failures and trade of another country at the
essence of the United States. The operation of his Â®
j> irft was moreover calculated to diftttrb the ex
iltuif; coutfc of three fourths of our import trade,
it--. ffths of our export trade, and the means, on C
wirn.il depended two-thirds at least of our revenues N
âto campel us to forego the use of British manu- H
failures, at a moment when they were become,
from the situation of France, more necessary than
ever, when it was impoflible to find a substitute of
our own, without a violent diflortiun of the natural
course of our indultry. p (
Altho' the project of the Secretary of State was Pr
very ill-timed in these particulars, yet it will not be
denied that it was perfectly -well timed, in refpeft to
those circumstances, on which the Secretary depen
ded more for support than on the intrinsic merit and
solidity of the work, for it was in the sequel une- Ce
quivocally demonstrated that he had relied less 011 Ke
the reasons contained in the report than on the pal
fans which he expected to find in the legi/hiture.
We have alrealy noticed that the relolution of
the representatives calling for the report, was dated
in February 1791, and that the report was not de
livered in till December 1793. What produced ]
this delay ? why was it net sent in during the feffi- is e
on of '92 ? why was the house informed, near the I Co
close of the session of '93, that, tho' completed, it cou
* might be better to delay it to the next session ? It
is not difficult to find the solution of these extraor
dinary circumstances ; in the winter, of '93, there J J
existed no violent pajions against Great-Britain, tho'
precisely the fame commercial grievances of which J I
the report complainctl. In the winter of *93, the I
session was necelfarily limited to 3d March, and the
party were occupied in another business, which en
gaged all their passions and attention, and which, j
had it fuceeeded, might have in their eltimation,' I
paved theviy to the fucceftof Mr. J.fferfon'splan. mu ,
ihat leffion was principally taken up with the per- fooi
fecutmg mea/ures against the late Secretary of the ed '
Treasury, which terminated so honorably to him and an j
iodfgracefully to his enemies, besides, there did not bro,

was received yesterday by a gentleman in this city, I
from his correspondent at St. John's, dated Ou
tober 10, 1796. I Mri
" I am foi ry to infotm you that capt. Porte has f
been captured by a squadron of French men of war, j
Duval under the command of admiral Richery, which late

off this harbor early in the morning of the Ift wit. I
g- and had they tljen made an attempt on this place, Â£) 0
I have no doubt they would have carried it, which
am now happy to lay, fhoiild they now attack it, I a
they would fail therein, as I think we a,e now in a 1
pretty good state of defence." The .writer pro
ceeds to itate, that on the appearance of the fleet I
an immediate embargo was laid on all vessels and
boatsâthat a total) Ibgnation of business had in con

Cox, formerly of this city, now of New-Jerfcy, and John
Bayard, formerly of said city, and speaker of ;'ae House
of Aflembly ef said state, now of Brunfwick, Niw-Jerfey,
affiguees oi said Scott & M'Michael, to come forward aid
pay over the monies they have had iÂ« their hands belong
ing to the creditors these 31 or 33 years. Some years a
â  go the creditors were called together ; Mr. Cox appear
ed in behalf of himfclf and Mr. Bayard, and allege j tHÂ»t
they were apprehensive they might be brought into trou
ble if they parted with the money (which 1 apprehend it
foine thousands,) as his Britannic Majesty had a debt due
him for government bill?: it was however agreed by the
creditors met, thit theaflignees (hculitake the opinion of
counlel; they did so, and it was that they would be sale
in dividing the money among the creditors. I urgÂ«d Mr.
Cox to bring the business to a final close ; his answer was,
it would be but a trifling sum ; my reply was, if ever so
trifling, I would have my proportion of it. It has how
- evet lain over.
I therefore hope the creditors will now come forward
and oblige the alfignees to divide whatever they have, afid
. they onght to pay intercft too.
