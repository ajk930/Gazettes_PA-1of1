Mr. Barney s haste to persuade his fellow-citizens
that h<?has, as yet, committed no piracies upon
their property, has brought to light some curious
cor.feflions. Among other things, ic appears, that
he is, at lcail, part owner of a privateer called the
Vengeance; and that there is fomelody in Balti
more, upon wbom Ill's captain can take the liberty
to diaw bills. Had not Mr. BÂ»rney made this dif
coveiy, his captain's sea drafts might have been
clafled with Buonaparte's Leghorn receipts. He
also informs the public that his privateer had cap
tll red no American vessels on the 12th December.
Why alf j did he not add, that no po/itive orders to
capture had been received from Mr. Adet sr the
time Ins privateer failed upon her cruise ? it i 6
whispered that before he left the Cape, his privateer
was put in poflfeflion of orders to capture out ves
sels, and that his agent, Mr. Willfon, was to fell
them and their cargoes.
Mr. Fenno,
THERE is nothing more common than to im
pute a public evil to a wrong cause. Thus at the
present foment, a number of people fcejp tp think,
that the high market rate or interest of mÂ»nÂ«y, it
owing entirely to the will of the comparatively few
who have it to dispose of. In order to draw the at
tention of individuals, both legislators and others,
to a full difeuffion of the fubjeft by an able writer,
1 request you will publish the following extracts
from " Smith's Wealth of a book Jiighly
esteemed by every one who has read it.
111 Vol. 2âPage 41 âDobfon's Philadelphia
Edition, art the following obfeivations :
" In fome,countries the interell of money has
been prohibited by law. But as something can
every where be made by the use of money, some
thing ought every vvheie to be paid for the use us
it. This regulation, of preventing, has
been fouud from experience toenrrrafe the evil of
usury ; the debtor being obliged to pay, not only
for the use of the money, but for the rifle which his
creditoi runs by accepting a compensation for that
use. He is obliged, if one may fay so, to insure
hisereditor from the jpnalties of usury."
In the fame page, be observes, that " where the
rate of interest is fixed bylaw, it ought always to
be somewhat above the lowest market price, or the
price which is commonly paid for the use of mo
ney by thofewho can give the moil undoubted se
curity." He adds, in page 43, that "No law
can reduce the common rate of interest below the
lowest ordinary market rate, that cxifts when the
law is made."
Mr. Smith fnmewhere fays, that the precious
metals are the money of the world, and that every
country will have the (hare of them, to which it is
entitled, in proportion to the amount or produce of
its labour ar.d industry. in fpeakiug of indivi
duals, in pages 129 and 130, he fays, that "over
trading is the common cause of the scarcity of mo
ney," owing to individuals adventuring more large
ly when the profits of trade happen to be gteater
than ordinary, and meeting witfe difappoinimcnts
in sales and expected returns.
It is frequently said that money being the stan
dard whereby to fix the value of every thing else,
the rate of inteieft ought to be permanently fixed
'by law.
Mr. Smith in of the vol. before men
tioned, iilows it to be Â»' the inftrnment of com
merce and Â» nieafure of value." He however fays,
in page 126, " Gold.and Silver are to be bought for
a certain price lika all other co,n*ncu/ttics, and as they
are the price'of all other commodities, so all other
commsdines arc the prict*t)f those metals." .
If fortunately the foregoing quotations should
induce any of your readers to peiufe-the Doctor's
general reakning on ike Jubjtft, my eoi will be
anfwercd.
It is I believe an acknowledged truth, that gold
and filvcr change their value, owing to revolutions
in trade combined with other circumftanccs. It
then the legislature should attempt to fix a certain
price oa them, at lead for any considerable length
of time, would it not in all human probability be
an arbi.rary one ?

DIRECTIONS
fk_ /
For preventing calamities by F I R E.
1. Ksep your Chiainies and Stove-pipes clean
by sweeping them at lfaft once every month.
2. Never remove hot alhes in a wooden bucket,
or a wooden velfel of any kind, and look well to
the alh-hole.
3. After sweeping a hearth, fee that the hearth
brush does not retain any partiulcs of fire, before
yoa hang it up in its usual place.
4. Oblige all your servants to go to bed before
yon, every night, and infpeft all your fire places
before you retire to reft. For fear of Occidents,
let a bucket ef water be left in your kitchen every
night. The-wriier of these aireftions oncp saved
his house from being eoril'umed by fire, by this pre
caution. ,
5. Do not permit a servant to cany a can lie to
his bed roam, if he sleeps in an unplaiftered garret.
6. Cover up your fire carefully every night in
ashes. Let the unburut pirts of the billets, or
chuncks of woad, be placed next to the hearth, by
which means no fparka will be emitted fron) the
wood. Pour a little water upon the bu-ning ends
of the wood which are not completely covered by
â¢ heafhei. Place before the fire a fender made of
(heet iron. This contrivance was well known in
England many years ago by the name of a coverfeu.
It has lately received from a top being added to it,
the name ot a hood.
7. Remove papers and linen from near the fire
when you leave it, to a remote part of the room.
8. Shut the doors of all the rooms in whiirh you
leave fire at night. By thus excluding the supply
of frefo air, you will prevent a flame being kind
led, should a coal or spark fall upon the floor, or
upon any other combustible matter in the room.â
The smoke which ifTues from this smothered fire will
find its way into every part of the house, and by
waking the family, may save it from de^ilftion.
9. If sickness, or any other cause should oblige
you to leave a candle burning all night, place it in
such a situation as to be out of the reach of the
tats. A house was once destroyed by a rat run
ning.away with a lighted candle for the fake of
the tallow, and conveying it into a hole filled with
rags, and other inflammable matters.
10. Never read in bed by candl: light, especial
ly if your bed be furrouoded by curtains.
11. Strictly forbid the use of fegars in your fa*
mily at all times, but more especially after night.
May not the greater frequency of fires in the U
mted States than informer yeats, be ascribed in
part to the more general use of fegars by careless
servants and children f There is good reaÂ£bn to be
lieve a house was lately set on fit* in Northumber
land cop nt y, by a half consumed fegat 1 , which a
negro we>mjn threw away, to prevent her being
detested by her matter in the unhealthy and otfen
five prafticc of imoking.
In cafe of fire, attend to the following direc
tions, to prevent or restrain its terrible conse
quences.
1. Do not open the room or closet door where
you fufpeft the fire to be, until you have secured
your familr, and your most valuable effects, nor
until you have coilefted a quantity of water to
throw upon the fare, the moment a frefh supply of
air excites it into a flame. Where water cannot
conveniently be had, try to iniother *fi>e by
throwing two or three blankets over it. A British
sea captain once saved a king's ship by throwing
himfelf with a spread blanket iu his arms, upon a
fire which had btoke out near the powder room.
He was pensioned for life, for this wife and meri
torious aft.
2. In t afe it be impossible to efcapr by a (lair
cafe from a house on fire, shut the door of your
bed chamber, and wait until help can be brought
to secure your efeape from a window.
3. If fafety does not appear probable in this
way, wrap yourselves up in a blanket, hold yoar
breath, and rush thro' the flames. If water be at
hand, firft wet the blanket.
4. To-prevent fire descending from the roof, or
ascending fiom the firft (lory, form by means of
blankets, a kind of dam on each of the interme
diate (lories, near their flair-cafe, that shall confine
the water that is thrown upon the roof, or into the
windows. It will effectually check the progress of
tlie fire downwards or upwards in brick aad done
ho'jfes.
5. To prevent fire spreading to-adjoining houses,
cover them with wet bankets.
6. To extinguish fire in a chimney, (hut the
door and windows of the roorp. Throw a quart,'
9rmÂ»rc of common fait into the fire. Hold, or
iiail a wet blanket before the fire plate. If these
means fail, throw a wet blanket down the chimney
from the roof of the house.
There method used in some countries of glai
aing chimnies when they are built by burning com
mon fah iu them, which renders" them so smooth,
that no foot can adhere to them. ChimÃiei lo
conflrtjfted can never take fire.
Ladders are commonly used as the means of con
veying perfens from the windows of houses on fire.
Would ttot a long and (liff pole, with a rope fixed
at its upper end, be jnore portable, and convenient
for this purpose ?
The famous Mr. John Weftley, when a child waa
taken out of a window in his father's house whilst
it was ia flames, by one man (landing upon the
shoulders of another. This practice may be used
to rescue persons from tlu firft story of a house on
fire, where other means cannot be had with lufSci
ent convenience or expedition.
A WATCHMAN.
CONGRESS OF the UNITED STATES.
I HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, January it.
Mr. S<wan<wick'j Speech, concluded.
This, Mr. S. said, was the mÂ»ft impo.rant ques
tion which was ever brought before that house-
He trembled every day when ha confide.ed on what
a fliadow the revenues of this government rededâ
upon what evÂ»y nation seemed to rob us of : for,
added he, all are agreed inane paint, however rticr
msy disagree m othe.f, viz, to rub and ill treat ug.
Ihey were, indeed, invited to I, this; for, said
he, we have no barriers but treaties, and ihcv are
worse than nothing. ,
Mr. S. said we had no dependence upon owt re
venue ; at any rate it \Vas not mcne than fupporteil
eur present expences. Suppose, added he, all the
present nations at war, make pence, would there
than be na dangei of a defalcation of revenue Â»
There could be ho doubt of it. So that wheth r
war or peace, no certain dependaÂ»ce could be
plated upon our revenue.
Did it not, then, become government to look
to something more substantial than commerce for
support ? It certainly did. Let us, said he,'fix
upon the principle of a direst tax, and not be de
terred at tlie threshold of the bafinefs. To fay it
was impoffiSle to fix upon fueh a plan so as to be
generally fatisfatV-ry, would be to fay we coiild
not do what many other nations had done.
He would again repeat that it would have been
better tor this country if the present plan had
been adopted sooner. However, as we had lately
declared ourfelvts the mutt prosperous, the moil
free and enlighte: Â« ! lOuntry in the world,this rould
not be an for introducing it. He
was rather glad, however, that a degree of neces
sity had brought the present mea&irt before thetn.
Misfortunes, he fsi fornerimWTTr'oveirtiie g.eat.
eft of bltflingi. He irufled the present ' event
would teach government econ'orey; tor, lince they
found the difficulty which attended the mifinj; of
money, they would be careful hosv they laviihed it
away. He trulled this meafurtof tai iug the far
mer, would also have the effedi upon him to awak
en a watchful attention to the operations .of j>a
vemment ; it was also give us, the means of pay. .
ing our debt, and of (hewing to foreign countries
that our revenue relts upon a foundation which
they cannot shake.
v Viewing the matter in this point of view, how
ever unwilling he was, in general, to call upon the
people/or he hoped the principle befoic
them would be adopted.
Mr. Gilbert said, the question was whether they
(hould raise the revenue wanted fey dire& or indirect
taxes. Though he was opposed to direÂ£t taxes, he
had no obje&ion to the committee's riling, that
the report might be re committed, in order that
â¢ the committee of ways and means might be in
ftruited to report to the hnufe a plan of direct tax
ation, for the decision of the house. He acknow
knuwledged the neccflity of something being done,
but he was not ready- to vote for diredl taxation,
until he saw Something more of the business.
Mr. Christie was against the committee's rising,
becaufc he thought it was necessary to determine
upon the principle. He did not know whether
he should agree to this principle or not. It wa*
proposed that each state should be apportioned ac
cording to its last census. By this, he said, Mary
land woold be eonfiderably aggrieved. Several o
ther Rates were in the fame situation. If the gen
tleman would therefore withdraw his for
the committee's rising, he would move to (trike
out the words " according to the last census."
(The former motion was withdrawn.)
Mr. S. Smith hoped the words would ihe
(truck out; for, if they were truck oat, the
whole resolution would fall to the ground, as. if
they were not to mike a calculation ripen the tact
eenfus, they must either poltpoue the bulislefs un
til a new census was made, or go into the expeuce
of making a new census for the business*
Ihe gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Swan,
wick) had gone fully ihta the bufifefs, and (hewn
to the fatisfa&ion, he doubted not, of many in that
Houle, the necefiity of going intn fÂ»n>e effeiftual
mode for fceuring a permanent revenue. Hi Le
lieved it would be found a fubjedt of difficulty to
carry into effect a direct tajc throughout the uniou,
but as the committee of Ways and Means had
brought forward the proposition, he doubted njt
they had attended to these difficulties.
He was not afraid of the state of Maryland being,
over-iated by taking the last cenfu-. it was not
necefi'ary, he said, to go into that fubjedt, or he
'believed Maryland ought to have had another re
presentative on that floor. He thought they (hould
not object to the plan befoie them on trifling
ground, as they Heed ntver be able to apportion
any system to farthings. Whether he (hould vote
for the system proposed h: knew not, but he wished
to have the fubjeit taken up, that we might have,
it in our power to fay, we arc an independent na
tion, and that it may not b<: in the power of any
> other to cut off our supplies. Such a step, he fai4,
was necessary, and he doubted not the people would
be found willing to give their government a proper
support.
Mr. Christie said, if he thought his motion went to
destroy the principle, he would withdraw it ; but he
believed the principle wo.ild be as well tried without
the words as with them. He thought it would be proper
to have a new census taken. He wondered his colleague
(Mr. S. Smith) (hould think Maryland would u t be
over-rated by the present census. He was confident
they would. If those words were out of the refjlutioify
He would vote for it, but not other wife.
Mr. Nicholas had no objection to the words being
(truck out, because if they were out, they must be
guided by the last census, except a new one was taken :
and if the gentleman could not take the sense of the
House upon the propriety of taking a new cinfus, with
out ftrikmg out these words, he hoped they would be
struck out, in order to give him an opportunity of try
ing that question.
The question for striking out was put and negatived.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) said the fubjedt was aa
important one, and from his prepoffedion (gentlemen
perhaps might be inclined to call it prejudice) against
a system of dL'edt tuition, be could, aot think theHouse would be readily bro't to agree to Rich a sys
tem. Ht only role, however, then to notice what ha '
fallen from the ?eiuic..ien from N. York and S.Caro
lina (Mr. Gilbert Â»nd Mr. Harper) who had wilhed
to have the detail upon which the principle before them
to be carried into effect. He thought they (hould
fiflt decide upon tlie principle, whether they fhoukl
resort to a power, which had never yet been resorted
to, of railing revenue ;in fa<s), whether a plan of di
reil or indirect laxesthould l)e puri'ued. The dceifion
upon this quellion, he said (hould have no allulion to
the manner of effe<3ing it ; because, if the committee
of the whole did not think it neceflary at this time to
go into a fyitem of dirtfl taxation at aJI, they would
lit determine, and a plan of indiretf taxation ought
immediately to be conlideied. He was therefore
far from willing the resolution to be fefu back to j
the committee of ways and means to have ilie bulinels '
detailed; he would have the abftrajt principle firft de
cided upnVj D. hoped the lentiments of gentle
men would be fully given upon this fubjetl ; for his
own part, if he heard no stronger arguments in favour
of the plan than had been offered, he (hould certainly
be opposed to it.
Mr. W. Smith thought the gentleman last up had
placed the fubje<a on its proper ground. The principle
ought certainly to be firit decided upon. It was ac
knowledged on all hands, Mr S. said, that there was a
deficiency of revenue ; gentlemen who were opposed
to, this plan, fliould therefore substitute some other] in
its place, since reveilue mult be had. It was a good
parliamentary rule, that when a member opposed an
object proposed tor revenue, he (hould propose a sub
stitute. It was ealy, he said, to object to a thing. He
disliked dxe<f\ taxation himfelf, but since there appear
ed no other way of raifmg fufficiently ample funds, he
saw the neceflity of fixing upon this. If gentlemen
would propose any other mode of raifmg the money
wanted, lie /hould be glad to eonfider it. He thought
at any rate, they (hould then determine upon the prin
ciple before any further Iteps were liken in preparing
any plan ; and, if it fhonld appear to be the opinion ot
a majority of the Honfe that, under no conlideration
whatever, a fyflera of dire<st taxation (hould be adopt
ed, there would bean end'ofthe biifinefb & they must
immediately turn their attention to forÂ»e other way of
railing the money requiied ; for his part, he was
afrai'l if they palled over from diredl to indirect tacts
they (hould not cone to any fhinj; effectual.
Mr. Williams was of opinion with the gentleman
from New-Jerl'ey, (the Speaker) that the principle
- 4 fliould then l.e determined upon ; iiecaufe to lento the
I resolution back, in order to have apian digested, if it
J fliould evenually be rejeiled, would be an unnecefTary
walte of time. He wilheH gentlemen from every state
would make their observations upon the fubjedl, in or
der that they might determine whether some belter
plan could not be adopted. He thought every fneans I
of indirect taxation (hould be exhausted, before direst
taxes (hould'be resorted to.
Mr, VVÂ» said he did not think with the gentleman
from Pennsylvania ( Mr. Swanwick) that the landed
interefi did not pay their proportion of the present tax
es. The confunters, it was allowed, were th# payers
of taxes ; and until that gcntltman proved that farrrt
t ers did not consume taxable articles, he must not fay
they did not bear their pioportion of the public bur
dens.
It was well observed that our present revenue sys
tem was liable to he deranged by other nations; but
perhaps it might be poflible to adopt some other lyf
tem, which Ihould be more certain, without having
reference to direÂ£l taies. He could wi(h mercantile
gentlemen would forbear throwing out insinuations
that the landed interest did not pay their quota of the
public txpences ; be believed they were unbounded,
and he was certain they could have no jroodeffc<Â£l.
For lhe present, he fliould wilh the committee
to rife, and hoped gentlemen would come forward
another day, with their observations on this fuh
jeft, that they might fee if iliey could not hit up
on some plan of raifmg the neceflary supplies, with
out going into the plan of direA taxation.
The committee rose end hid leave to lit again.

NEW THEATRE.
ON WEDNESDAY ite historical play of Co'.um
t bus, or 1 World Difcoveted, was performed for the
- second time, to 1 most crowded audience.
; The managers are entitled to. great praise for bring
: ing forward this play in such a grand (tile as hey have
1 done. The (cÂ«nery, &c. does high honor to the res
â¢ peitive artists who executed them : no expence, or ex
, ertion, seems to have been wanting to make the proces
sions pageants, &c. worthy of observation ; and we
; dott'fmot tÂ»U 1 the Irouole of the manager* will tie am
) ply repaid by having a crowded house every night it is
performed.
Mr. Cooper's Columbus was a very chaste piece of
ailing: he has been censured for over ailing ; but we
â¢ observe that his performance is improvÂ«d
in this particular, and we doubt not, but in a Ihort rime,
. he will be considered as an actor of tbe firft reputation,
at leaf! his performances fairly promise it.
Mr. Moreton played the feeling, gallant Alonzo with
Ereat sensibility The admirers of this gentleman (anil
] wÂ« confefs ourselves to be of that number) have obser
ved with pleasure the rapid improvements that he has
- made within these two years, and we are of opinion
. that his performance this I'eafon, furpafTes all hn for
t mer exhibitions : the exquisite adting of mrs. Merry
probahly has called f i rth some of that dormant genius
j that before had dept. We notice that he is p | ay
. to mrs. Merry's Belvideta, and we doubt not '
but Ins performance will be excellent. It was general
ly acknowledged, that he failed in that character two
â¢ years ago ; but thoTe who crnfured hi. performance
t ought to have been informed, that his failure was not
; owing to his want of genius, hut want <>f fludv, Â«"
. the tragedy never was rehearsed : this was%fufTicient
t apology foj^him.
â  n M ,'' loX ,' B entit,ed to P rlire fer hia performance of
' Koldan. e are happy to .-bfcrve that he di<j not this
evening pay more attention to the audience than to his
pan, as he sometimes does. An aitor ought not to
1 appear eonfcious ot the company of the andience
. I rn.l, h ur. to keep his eyes upon them during the per
formance : tis an odious habit, and we fl-iter ourselves
, hi has leen it so, and will praÂ£tire it no more
Mr. Wignell was iisdeed the vociferous, brave, eood
hearted Englllhman, in Harry Heibert : we have never !
1 iceii him play more nataraliy.
i A ." thofc wil Â° have fce " mr - Harwood perform Dr '
Lenitive, &c. will give us credit when we afifure them
â  that in Dr. Dolores he was ex.ellent. His perform- I
anee, in company with that lacetinas aaor mr Francis '
â  in the character of Biibon, set the whole house in a
! roar. , ]
Mr. Warren was very refpeflable in Orozimbo, as â¢
was also mr. L tftrange in Solali o.
We are confident that the deep attestion' that was ]
paid to the performance of the charming mrs. Merrv
mult have been more flattering to her than tK loudest '
plaudits that could have been beftowsd ; for our own '
part We must confefs, that while (he was playing Cora 1
we forgot we were in a theatre ;we forgot the accom (
phfhed adtrefs, and beheld only the charming Indian I
maid that was to b* devoted to the facrifice. In short
her aflmg was so truly excelient, that it could defy the
fevcreft c riticifm. '
Mrs. Francis was very lively and spirited in Nelti â¢ *
we have faldom seen her perform with greater ease thaa 0
(he did on Wednesday. Her coquetry as imitated v
from the defeription given her by Harry Herbert was fl
truly diverting, and seemed to give the audien.e entire o
fatisfaclion.
We ourselves confefs that it is more giatifyine to
view ladies as fair as the graces, than India,, women !
without anjrof the feminine graces that adorn the En
ropean beauties; but we would Â«(k if it is natural ? n
Ought net the ladies to have exhibited at lead in their w
diajfs some affinity to the Indian customs ? 'Tis true the C
d??(s of mrs. Francis was charatftereftie, but if ma a
Merry had left out the golden itar that adorn'd her bo- k.
lorn, fhc might have u<fled Sophia in the " Road to
Kuin," &c. &c. and the dress would have been more
adapted for tbeir representation then that of Cora.
The only .apology we have to offer for the length of m
of this criticism is } that ths performance of so celebra- 01
ted a play as Columbus ought io be entitled to some *t
nonet, and wuie paattulariy fj, when at the fame si
/
trn we endeavor to express our approbation of the liberal!-
, . ty and taste ot the managers, together with th e merite

" For the workmen is worthy of his meat."
TF there be such a personage as Truth, this as
fertinn certainly belongs to her family, for what
can be more just, than tl>ar a vintager (hould eat
fonric at lea(t us those grapes, which he had planted
and watered.
But, judging from the pra&ice of the world,
at ihe piefei't tinw, ouc w>>u!d think my text was
grown oLfolete and that its principle was unrecog
nized. In the (hamhlet there is always meat e
nouj;h, hut how little is bestowed U| on workmen ?
P;irÂ»lites, buffoons, fiddlers, equeftriant, French
philofophert and fpeculatort gormandize ; but â¢ I
fee Merit, that excellent workman that needeth not
to as lank and as lean, as my old tabby
cat, who hat bad nothing tÂ» eat but chuteh mice
for a year.

a cordial regard for the established clerÂ«y. I consi

men ; they make us monl, they inllruft our yoÂ»th,
they lead sober and peacesble lives,

They are wife, ihey are amiable men. I wish 1
could speak half so fervently in praise of a.iother
learned profeffion. But, though they are ignorant
of foolifh questions and " drivings about the la<w,"
thej underlland perfe&ly the great lules of life.
Such men, therefore, are worthy of their meat,
and (hould be liberally provided. They labour
much, few mea labor nnore ; they are compelled
to exercise not only the head, but the hands. The
private farm as well as the goipel vineyard claims
I their eare. When the drudgery of the year it
done ; when nurrerotis sermons have been com
posed, and numerous lick chambers visited, when
j they have been in watchings and weaiintfg often,
1 what meat wiil the benevolence of a pari Hi bestow ?
Verily a morsel. A beggarly pittance called a fa-
Wy, and that pittance scantily and grudgingly paid.
âWhen I visit a village covcied with (lores and

AÂ« soon as the advertisement appeared of our

We are informed that the mod aoble the duke
of Northunnbcrland) in 41l the new icfcfet he now
grants to his tenants on large farms, makes a refnve
of the cottages, which he now lets lo the induf
tiieus labouiert, and to each of them adds fufficient
ground for the support of a cow, aid the growth of
a neceflary quantity of potatoes for the fuppo't of
their families ; thereby rendering the labourer iu
dependent of the opulent farmer, and affbrdirtg
them an opportunity of bringing the fruits of hit
labour to a fair market. It has been too much the
custom of this country to include the cottages io
the general lease of the farm, and thereby keep the
induftrions labourer pcrfeAly independent on the
farmer. We canaot help recommending to tke
confederation, and consequent imitation, of all

AN ENQUIRY r
Concerning Political Justice,
And its Influence on Morals and Happiness,
By William Godwin.
THE .eputation oi this wwrk is already well esta
blished in Europeâlt is hardly necefTary for an Ame
rican editor to lay more than barely to mention, that
the Enquiry concerning Political Justice has ever
since its publication been a favorite performance with
the friends of republican government. The ltile is
pure, nervous, and classical; the ideas are strongly
marked by an original vein of thinking ; and, amongit
a-multitude of other just and striking paflages, the
author's delineation of the peculiar infelicities infepa
rabie from the condition ot a King, iÂ»ay be pointed
out as a most masterly lpecimen of philol'ophical dif
quifition. The latest London edition of this work
fells in this city at four dollars and an half.

Porcupine's Gazette.
Proposals by WILLIAM COBBETT, oppolite Christ
Church, Philadelphia, for publishing a news-paper,
to be entitled
Porcupine's Gazette, iff Daily Adveriifer.
Metlunks 1 hear the reader exclaim ; " What! have
we not Gazettes enough already Â»" Yes, and far tuo
many : hot those that we have, are, in general, con.
duifted in luch a manner that their great number, in.
Â«rdd of lendering mine unneceflary, iÂ» the only cause
that cdls for.its eftablilhmentv ~â
The gazettes in this country have done it more real in
jury than all its open enemies ever did or can do. They
mislead the poopic-at home and milieprefent them aÂ«<'
broad, 1 It was these vehicles of ledrtion and difccrd
that encouraged the counties in the Weil to rebel ; it
was they that gave rile to the depredation j of Britain,
by exciting the people to such aits of violence against
that nation, as left 110 room to doubt that we were de
termined on svar ; and it was they, when an accom
modation had been happily effedled, that ftirr<ad up an
opposition to it such as has seldom been witifoiTed, and
which was overcome by mere chance. These gazettes
it was, that, by misrepresenting the difpolitions o! the
people, encouraged the French to proceed from one
degree of infslence to another, 'till at last their Mmif
tdr braves. thÂ« President in his chair, and a bullying
commander comes and tells us that his only bulinefs is
to fei*e our vellels, in violation of a treaty, 1(1 virtue
ot which alone he claims a right to enter our ports : and
it is tkel'e gazettes that now have the impudence to de
fend what their falfehood and malice have produced.
J (hall be told that the people are to blame; that
they air not obliged to read these abominable publica*
tions. But they do read them j and thousands who
read thero, read nothisg else. To fupprels them im<-
possible ; they will vomit forth their pdjfon ; it if >pti
-1 vilege of their natures, that no law can abridge ; and
therefore the only mode left is, to cuui,tcrSiÂ£l its efficts.
Tiristnulk *e done, Too," IritKeirown way. Books,
. or periodical publications in the form of books, may
be of some service, but are by no means a match for
I their flying folios. A falfebood that remains uncontra
. difled for a month, begins to be looked upon as a truth,
; and when the dete&ion at last makes its appearance, it
t 1 is often as useless as that of the doilor who finds his
; patient expired. The only method of opposition, then,
is to meet them on their own ground ; to set foot to
foot ; dii'pHte every inch and every hair's breadth;
j fight them at their own weapons, and return them two
, blows for one
; A gazette of this stamp is what I have long wished to
fee, but'l have wiihed and cxpeifled it in vain. li.dig-
I nation at the fupinei)efs of others has at last got the
j better of all diffidence in my own capacity, and has de
termined me to encounter the task. People have hÂ£ar(l
