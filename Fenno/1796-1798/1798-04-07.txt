Ma- BAYARD.
1 (hall not f.ll'tw th-- example of the gen.
tleman wh'> isjuft fat down (Mr R. Willi
ams) in assigning reasons againlt the vote
which I drffgn- to give, but (hall content
mvfelf in ftrting and maintainingthe giounds
, tipon which I am opposed to the amendment
under consideration. I had thought and
ft iil believe that the principles upon which
gentlemen differ, are well understood; We
do not deny the power of this honfe in the
appropriation of money, nor the difffretion
which they may constitutionally exercise in
fixing the proper amount of a salary for a
minister Plenipotentiary, or for any other
officer employed by the government. On
the other hand, gentlemen who differ from
us, do not contend :hat 9000 dollars per
annum is too great a salary for a m:niller
plenipotentiary, but they fay that no mi
nister is necessary at Berlin or Li(bon, and
therefore they will not appiopriate for their
support. If this house has not a right to
judge of the grade of miinfters, or of the
places at which it is proper to employ them,
no reason will remain,fur our refufing to ap
propriate in the manncrcontemplated by the
bill in its original (hape,
The fir ft que (lion therefore, which natu
rally presents itfe'.f in this discussion, is whe
ther the power of fixing the number and
grade of foreign ministers, belongs in any
degree to this house, or exclusively to the
Executive. \ \
By the constitution, the right of receiv
ing foreign ministers is given to the Presi
dent, nor is there any pretence ijnder which
this house can claim a {hare of that right or
its incidents. The obligation to appoint
foreign ministers may frequently arise from
the communications they make to the pow
er which receives them. The powers there- j
fore tof appointing and receiving feera to me
co-relative, and eflentially to belong to the
fame branch of government.
But the power- of appointing is as ex
pressly given to the President, as the power
of receiving ministers. As ministers, how
ever, cannot be employed abroad, without
money being,appropriated for their support,
as money cannot be appropriated but by
la .v, it is therefore said we may enquire into
the propriety of the appointments before
we -ppropriate.
Sir, I apprehend wherever an of
fice, created by the constitution, or by
law,Ms legaily filled by the President, that
we are Iwrid to provide a reasonable com*
penfition for the officer. The gentleman
turin Pennsylvania, however has told us,
that the<>ffice of foreign minister is created
by ttoe President, and does not exist under
the constitution. This is one ofthofebold
aflcrtions which we so often hear from that
quarter, and intended tp impose upon the
cafy credulity of a part of the house. I
ask ths gentleman whether the power of
creating offices is of an Executive nature ?
And, if not, I beg him to point out to
me the clause in the constitution which in
any cafe gives such a power to the Presi
dent ? But in order to oppose the aflertion,
I will be}-, lew to refer to the provision of
the constitution on the fuhjeft.
[Mr. B. here read the following paffiige
from the; 2d feÂ£t. of the 2d art. of the cor.
ftitution :â" He," the President, " (hall
nominate, and by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, (hall appoint ambas
sadors, other public ministers and consuls,
jodgee of the Supreme Court, and all other
officers of the UiWted States tuhofe appoint
ments are r.'.t herein other wife provided Jor,
Â«. rind which Jhall he ejlaiiijhed by law."']
By this clause it explicitly appears that
the power of appointment extends only to
offices providedby the constitution, or which
afterwards {hould be eftabliftied by law.â
The place ef minister then, is an office cre
ated by the constitution. But it i 3 contend
ed by this gentleman that ministers stand u
pon the fame ground with judges of the Su
preme Court, and, as we had limited the
number of the latter, so we have a right to
restrain the number of theTormer. Now,
Sir, by referring again to the Constitution,
I apprehend I can (hew, that the cases (land
on different grounds, and that there is a
a power gjven to us to interfere in the cafe
of judges, which does not belong to its in
the cafe of ministers.
[Mr. B. here cited the 3d art. of the con
stitution, fedt, 1 ft. as follows:
Â« The judicial power of the United
States (ball be vested in one Supreme and
fnch inferior ccrurt? as the Congress may
from time to time ef}ub'itb."~\
It appears from this clause, that a su
preme court is provided, but the mode of
its eftablilhment is cxprefsly left to congrufs.
Beside, it is evident from the constitution,
that the framers of it frequently referred to
things as known. As when they provide
in criminal cases that the trial (hall be by
jury, it was understood that the jury (hould
consist of twelve men, and a verdift be the
unanimous opinion of the whole. And so
in thf cafe of the supreme court, that the
number of judges could not be indefinite,
and of consequence muil be limited by
congress. This is certainly not the cafe as
to foreign ministers. Their number can be
r.o more limited than the number of foreign
powers. By lesser.ing the number of inde
pendent nations (which is a work going on
very faft) the constitutional power of the
PreGdent on this fubjetl will be restrained.
If the doctrine be founded, that this
house has a right to refufc to appropriate
for the salary of foreign ministers, I a(k
gentlemen to reconcile it with their admis
sion, that no such right tu refufe exists in
the cafe of the President or judgesA dif-
has been attempted. It is said,
that in the cafe of these olicers, the con
stitution has provided that their compensa
tion shall not be dimini(hed during their con
tinuance in office. But it strongly appears
to me, and I do insist, that by conceding
that in the <;afeof the President and judges
we are bound to appropriate, the whole ar
gument on the other fide is given up. Bc
caufe it allows, that nowithftanding we
have an express power on the fubjeit of ap
propriation, that yet there are cases in which
that power mull be passively exercised, with
out the ufc of the difctetion which it if
strongly contended eflentially bel to it.
And now, fir, as to the distinction be
tween judges and ministers, I beg leave to
remaik, that in the cafe of judges, the pro
vision of the constitution goes only to the
quantum of the salary, and prohibits the di
minution of it during their continuance in
office. But as to the principle that a reason
able compensation shall be allowed, the ca
ses stand on the fame footing. â¢ The only
difference is, that in the cafe of the judge
we have nÂ»t the power of faying the salary
is too great, but we are bound to appropriate
to the last farthing ; whereas, in the cafe
of a minister. we have the right at all times
of. reducing the amount of his pay. Ibe
lieve, fir, it can hardly be denied, that I
when the framers of he constitution creat- j
ed an office, or gave afpower to create one,
and directed the office to be filled by the
President, that they contemplated a reason
able compensation being provided foi the
officef. It was a thing so well liuderltood,
that it would have been folly to have expres
sed it, as great folly as to have provided
that it (hould be the duty of the judges to
I expound the law. And, therefore, Iho d
r that in the cafe of ministers and all other of
t ficers legally appointed, that this house is
bound to concur in an appropriation for a
reasonable compensation. N
In order to maintain their ground, gen
tlemen, on the other fide, have descanted
largely on the fubjecl of checks, and per
t ftiaded themfclves that the right to refufe
l an appropriation in the present cafe, sprung
trom the general spirit of the couftitution,
_ ' which designed that one branch of the go
c ! vernment flioald opperate as a check upon
i another.
| The dodtrine as contended for, has em
' phatically been ftiled an imported doilrine,
but I hope it will not befmuggled into this
r _ house without inspection and examination.
t The cases of checks to be derived from the
t constitution, I apprehend may be classed
under three heads.
1. Where an express power is given to
_ c one branch to control the operations of a
nother. 2. Where a branch of the gov.
r_ ernment exceeds its powers. 3. Where a
general power is given to one branch, and
Jt a substantive power included within the
.. terms of it given to another. Thus, in the
in firft cafe : in the legislature, the senate is a
s cheek upon this house, and this house up
-1(j on the senate, and the President upon both.
fr In the executive, the senate on the Prefi
|(j dent, as to treaties and appointments. And
at in the judiciary, one court upon another.
le Upon the second head, a c?.fe mentioned
I by the gentleman, from Virginia, and mucft
relied on, furnilhes a ftrikitig example. E
j ven the judges, the gentleman said, are a
:o check upon the legislature. This arises
; n from the nature of the legislature, the pow
[â¢_ ers of which are limited. If the legislature
n transgress the bounds of their authority,
Q f their aÂ£ts are void, and neither the people
nor the judges are bound by them. So if
TÂ£ the President should commission, after an
appointment non-concurred by the senate,
jjj the comtaiffion would be void. And in all
)( j cases where an aft is done without power,
a check may be found wherever we please
| g to look for it. The third cafe which has
â r been mentioned is, where the general pow
er of one branch is controlled by a particu
r lar power given to another branch. To this
head may be assigned another cafe much re
lied on by the gentleman from Virginia.
to The cafe I refer to, is that of a treaty
made by the President having war for its
_ objedl. 'Now, as the exclusive power to
e . declare war is vested in congress, I have no
j. j hesitation in faying, the President has not
u _ j the power to make a treaty of offenfive and
| defenfive alliance. For though such a pow
le er may fee embraced in the general terms
:o g' vln g t ' le power to make treaties ; yet, as
j the right to declare wai is diftinttly given
n to congress, it must operate as exception
lc j t o the general treaty-making power.
a These are the cases of legitimate checks which
f e occur to me. But an tÂ« the wild ioflrine whirli
u had been contended for, tint wher vÂ»r on-*
branch of government pofiefles any degree of
pnwer, that a discretion neceflarily accompanies
5 " the exercise of it, nolhing I conceive'can he
more dangerous, or have a more diredt tenden
d cy to disorganization. If the principle were af
d ferted by each branch, tie operation? of the go
vernment must cease. The prefiilent m'ght fay,
he was not bound blindly to execute laws which
he conceived to be abfiird or impolitic, We
creates offices, he refufe to fill them ; we ap
'* propriate money, herefufes to apply it ; we de
s. Clare war, he refufes to carry it on, because, con-
I, fulling his own judgment,he conceives our mea
o fures tote unwise, and that it would be better
| e for the country to check us, by refufing the aid
of his constitutional power to carry our febemes
'. iitoeffeft. I beg leave to put a ease which I
conceive ccnifi np to the strongest point of the
[ e argument on the other fide,
o Suppose fongrefs declare war. This can be
ie done by a majority of both houses. The presi
dent participates the power of appropriating
money. Now suppose w;r actually declared,
ty a power competent and expressly sllowed to
ju.lge of its expediency, ind t:.e president after
>e wards conceiving the war to be unjust, or the
i n dedarition premature, rufufes to concur in an
e- appropriation iÂ« fupp. f" it. In such cafe, we
m (hould be conflitutionally at war, and conltitu
le ticnally retrained from carrying it on.
Such are the absurdities which fl w Tro.-n the
imported doSrine of cheik.. Conii quences
which tend to pa a ize 'he powers of theconfti
tution, and effVilually tp the wheels of go
lk vernment.
f- I have no doubt, Sir, for my own pift, that
in this hoi fe has no right to interfere upon the prin
f_ ciplc of the amendoKUt ; but I wiliÂ» notwith-
Rinding, 1-Tififlcr tfce txpcdit nty as the tnca- o
sure it contemplates. b
It his been contended bv the gentleman from t<
Pennsylvania, that it would he better for this d
country to renounce all foreign interconrfe â
This, I conceive, is g ing far beyond any point- o
of difcuflion before the committee. The amend- b
mrnt if not designed to abolifti forrien inter- b
course. It supposes three minifies plenipoten- vl
tiary.and as many ministers rrfident and confals â¢<
as the president (hall think pr iper to appoint. P
Indeed it effeXs only thÂ« grade of the ministers b
at Lisbon and Berlin. Â°
Sir, I could have wilhed to avoid anv imputa
tion upon the motives which produced tni pre- c
feiit amendment. But it strikes me as Angular 11
that gentlemen (hould be fatUfied with reltrain- Â°
ing its operation tMwoehiraXers, anil that furh "
miphty efforts (hotild be made to accompliftl an 0
o'>jrX attended with so little saving to the trea n
fury, am! at- b-ft equivocal, as they must ac- r
as to its operation abroad. I can
not Â« Â«!l account for what I have 4e?n, but in re- f
colleXingthat the minister at L'.ibon *Â» for- T
nierlv a distinguiShed member of this house, Â£
Â» hole eminent talents having been employed in j
the frpport of government, has rendered him oh i v
noxious to the friends of the amendment ; and ! a
that the minister at Berlin is the son of the Pre- j 1
li lent of the United States, a man as much hat- j
ed by one party as venerated by the other. I
(honld have been wi ling to have difearue-d any , 15
fttfpuions which theie recolleXions occaftoned, j
h.id I been able to discover any pla'ufible reason ' *
j at â  his time for introducing and foftrongly m iin- ;
! taining the amendment.
Gentlemen have talked of annihilating foreign I
intercourse. DÂ» they call to tnind our sea coast
of 1700 miles ? Do they remtm! er the commer
cial temper and Habits of our people ? Do they j
recolleX how mny imported articles, though
perhaps once luxuries, are now become neeeffa
ries of life ? Do they calculstt the portion of (
our food and raiment whi his l>ro :gtit a.oofs â¢
the ocean ? Can they fit down to a meal in the , '
day, or examine the cloths on th.-ir backs, with
out being sensible of the strength of our foreign
connexions ? I beg gentlemen, after having (
duly appreciated these cenfidera'ions, to tell
whether the) ferioully imagine that any force
in the government could break owr connexion
with foreign countries ? I believe, for my pan,
that while the ocean is navigable, that our peo
ple will be commercial, and that foreign con
nexions 1 annot prevented. The only quef
tio i which seems to ejeift is, whether, as tiieif
will be interconrfe with foreign countries; it
does not admit of beneficial regulations from the
interference of government.
The gentleman from Pennfylvaniahas consid
ered this ftibjeX under two heads, commercial
and political, and has endeavoured to (hew, that
our connexions with Europe, commercial or
political, do not require a diplomatic eftablilh
ment.
Commercial intercourse, he continues, might
be as well regulated and prottXcd by the em
ployment of consuls as of ministers. Very little
consideration, I apprehend, will fatisfy gentle
men, that consuls jre inadequate to the proteX
ion of the commerce of a great c untry. Con
suls are litt.'e more than private mercantile a
gents. They are frequently the fubjeXs of the
country in which they are stationed, fubjeX to
its laws, 3i well in civil as in criminal cases, not
privileged, and scarcely noticed by the law of
nations, and leprcfentingr in no degree, the
country which employs them. I will then alk,
if consuls are compete.tt to insist upon the rights
of the nation, or its citizens, or to remonstrate
against their wrongs. Whether they could de
mand, or are so likely to obtain justice, as it they
were cloa-thed with a representative capacity of
the country. Beside, let me tell the gentleman,
that if our eftablifhmems abroad were reduced
'to consuls. in esseX, they would only have fo
reign ministers under new names, for they
would soon be employed for political, as well as
commercial purposes. It would end in their
exerciflng the powers of ministers, without their
refpoafibility.
I'hi- gentleman from Pennsylvania has said,
that the only use of ministers is to form treaties.
This ia certainly not true. I conceive that a
government is bound to extend its eare and pro
teXion to its citizens abroad, as well as at home.
One purpose, therefore, of ministers is, to fscure
to our citizens in so eign countries, the rights
which they derived from treaties, or the law of
j nations. .They are designed also to watch the
aXions of foreign governments, and to discover
' their schemes, and to give notice to their own
: government of any thing which'may threaten
i the peace or fafety of their country. They are
again the organ of communication between go
vemments, by wlfich explanations are demand
ed," and by which accidental differences may
frequently be avoided without the extremity of
war.
(Tbit Speech to be continued. J
Friday, yVpril 6.
Mr. SITGREAVES, on behalf of the
managers of the impeachment against
William Blount, to whom was referred cer
tain proceedings of the Senate of the firj of
March, reported it as their opinion, that it
wo jld be expedient for the house to adopj the
following resolutions :
" Resolved, That a conference be desired with
the Senate on the fubjeX of their resolution tof the
firft of March last, relative to the impeachment of
William Blount, and that the managers appointed to
conduct the faid'impeachment, be the managers for
this house a the propefed conference."
" Resolved, That the managers of this house do
request, at the said conferenc , that the Senate will
appoint a day during the present session of Congress,
for the return of the summons directed by their re
solution of the iirft of March aforefaid, to be issued
to the said William Blount."
The resolutions were agreed to.
The Speaker laid before tha house a letter
from the Secretary of the Treasury, accom
panying- two statements, exhibiting the ton
nage of shipping belonging to the several dis
tricts of the United States, at the close of the
year 1796; also, a comparative view of the
tonnage of all veft'els which paid duties in the
por;s of the United States each year, from 1790
to 1796, inclusively, diftinguilhing generally,
the employments of the vell'els of the United
States, and the tonnage of vell'els belonging
to different foreign nations, in pursuance of a
resolution of the 4th inft. which was ordered
to be printed.
Mr. Sitg re av es asked and obtained leave
of absence for the next week.
Mr. Kittera also obtained leave of ab
sence for two weeks.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of.
claims, made a report on the petition of Ste
phen Dayton, dating that an unfavourable re
port was made upon this cafe in Â«793, by the
Secretary of war, to which they reier, and to
which they recommend an agreement. Con
curred in, ,
Mr. Macon moved that the house again
resume the consideration of the confidential
communication fronv the President, which
motion being agreed to, the galleiies wÂ«re ac
cordingly cleared.
.After the doors had been closed about an
hour and a half they were opened ; whrp
Mr. Livingston, from the committee to
whom was re-committed the bill fcr the relief"
of sick and disabled seamen, reported a new < a
bill, conformable to the amendments hereto- j i
fore adopted, which was committed for MOll- I
day. |-
The fame gentleftian front the committee j
of commerce apd manufactures, reported a
bill for erecting a light house and placing r
buoys at the places therein mentioned, which {
was committed for Monday. This bill con- t
templates the erection of a light houle at Old 1
Point Comfort, in Virginia, the placing of 1
buoys in Portland and the ftak'ng 1
out of Warren river. 1
The house fevera'ilv refolded itfelf into a
committee of the whole on the bill declaring (
the assent of Congress to two ads of the state t
of North-Carolina therein mentioned, and the
bill authorizing certain officers to prefcr.be 1
oaths, which were reported without amend- f
ment, and ordered to be engrossed lor a third t
reading oh Monday. , . 1
Mr- Bayard moved that noo copies of I
the dispatches from ourComm llioners in Pa- 1
ris, which were lately com.niin cated by the 1
Prelident of the United States, to Congrels, i I
i be printed for the use of members, which J
| would fiir iifh each about twelve copies for I
ahe puYpofie of tranfinitting to his conftitti- I
j ents.
' Mr; S. Smith moved to amend the refo
-1 lution, by adding after the words ' Congress,'
ami ordered by the Senate tt be publijbed.
Mr. D-nt thought ftic h an amendment
L would be v.ery improper, as the house had 110
; official knowledge of what the Senate had
j done with rclpect to these dispatches.
Mr. Nicholas wilhed to know whether
this resolution for printing was in order, as it
was in effect the fame with that 011 the pro
priety of publishing the papers decided,
vvhild the doors wera closed, to be postponed
till Monday.
The Speaker said a diftinftion had hereto
! fore been made been made betwixt printing and
I publtjhing. He recollected this diStintlfon was
; ailed upon in the confidential bitftnefs relative
to the Algerine treaty.
Mr. Gallatin could not fee any distinc
tion betwixt publijhing and printing 1 zoo copies
of the dispatches in question, elpecially as
gentlemen state them to be wanted tor the
purp' "t of fending to their constituents. He
fliould be in favour of printing for the mem
bers' own life, as was done in the cale alluded
to by the Speaker, but not for publication, as
that motion had already been postponed till
Monday.
Mr. Brooxs was surprized, when the
: injunXlon of ficiecy was taken off, that gen
tlemen (hould Still be opposed to tiÂ»e printing
' of these papers. Any person might now print
them ; and it was proper, whatever differences
' of opinion had been expteffed as to their pub
r lication heretofore, that they (hould now be
" made as public as possible. If gentlemen are
afraid of making them public, and wish to
: confine them in the dark, or to Philadelphia
" alone, they act rightly in opposing the print
e -ing ;â  but he hoped the motion would be car
" ried.
Mr. T. Claiborne moved a postpone
- ment of the question, which was negatived
- 42 to 32.
e Mr. Blount always thought it improper
0 to print more copies of any papers than were
't neueffary for the use of the members in con
s dutting the business of the house. When
e members wi(h to fend papers to their confti
, tuents, they can putchafe what number of
s copies theyyleale ; for if he were to have 12
e copies laid upon his desk, he (hould have oe
- caiion to purchase 20 or 30 more, ferthe pur
y pofeof fufficiently communicating the matter
if to his constituents.
1, The question on Mr. S. Smith's amendment
d was put and negatived.
>- Mr. Brooks did not fee why members
y (hould be put to the expence of purchasing
is what it would be for the public good to cir
ri- culate He therefore moved for 2000.
ir Mr. Thatcher seconded the motion, in
order to oblige the gentleman from N. Caro
1, lina (Mr. Blount).
5. Mr. H,\RPER-was in favour of the 2000,
a and if any one would move 3000, he should
j- be in favour of it, as he Should with to fend
e. a good number to his constituents.
â  e Mr. Shepard hoped less than 2000 would
ts not be printed.
3 f Mr. Hartley thought, after the motion
e for publication had been postponed tiil Mon
!r day, gentlemen ought to have been fatisfied
n with , having the usual number of copies
n printed.
re Mr. Gallatin said when he was up be
, fore hehad made lpme observations on the dif
[. tinftion which the Speaker had dated as sub-
Sifting betwixt printing and publishing ; but
it appeared as if the gentleman from New
York (Mr. Brooks) had neither attended to
what he had said, nor to what fell from the
chair, when he made a kind of reply. It he
had, he would have feenthat thofeobfervati
ons did not go to the question of publifhrng or
j not ; but to a point of order. It would be re-
J. I collected that the publication of thele papers
J had been opposed, not because they wished
j to prevent. their publication, because they
t ' e knew, though not officially, that the Senate
1 had ordered 500 copies to be printed ; but it
t j i had been opposed, because gentlemen did not
he wi(h to take upon themselves the refponfibili
Â£ ty of the publication. The question was
to therefore postponed till Monday. Mr. G.
or said his objeXion to this motion was, because
*' he conlidered it to be the fame motion which
j 0 had been postponed, only in a different form.
;U If this motion Should be proposed on Mon
fÃ . day, after the Senate have publi(hed the cor
â e_ refpondence, he (hould not objefl to it. A
ed large majority (of which he was one) were
opposed to the publication of these papers,
not 011 the ground of any eff'eX they would
er produce on the citizens of this country, but
1. i from an idea that they ought not to be pub
-- ! lilhed before we know the final ifl'ue of our
(- \ negociation. He believed that every gentle
ie j man who opposed thepublication,would have
i e ; wifned it, if the publication could have been
!e ; confined to our own citizens. He thought it
jo ; improper, therefore, that a contrary motive
y t 1 (hould be attributed to them.
Â»d Mr. Brooks explained,
ig Mr. Findley said the diftinXion was ve
a rycliar betwixt printing a paper in confidence
:d and printing it for the purpose of fending to
their constituents.
Mr. J. Williams said, since they had
taken off the secrecy from the confideration'of
j. the l'ubjeft before them, he thought it mat
tered little whether 500 or 2000 copies of the
of. papers were printed ; but if as many were to
e. be printed as each member wanted for his con-
E- Stituents, at least 3000 would he wanted, as
ie he represented at least 30 towns, and he could
:o not fend less than one to each. As to the
i- expence, he believed an hour's debate would
colt more than the whole 3000 copies,
in Mr. M'Dowell said, tlusquellion was the
al fame as that which had been postponed till
h Monday. He was sorry Hie motion for post
ponement was carried, because the fame thing
is now attempted to be done indireftly, which
in could not be effefted in a direst way. He
supposed on Monday the House would receive
to from the Senate the usual number of copies;
ef he hoped therefore the House would adjourn,
as there was na immediate occasion for print
ing.
The uftial motion for adjourning till Mon
day being firft decided, the mution for ad
journment was )>ut and negatived, 44t0 37.
Mr. Lyon was in favour of the largest
number; and if he followed the rule of the
gentleman from New-York, he might wish
for 7000, as he represented 70 towns. But
his principal reason for voting fir the largest
number was, because he thought the papers
so triflng and unimportant, that no printer
would n(k the printing of thetn in a pamph
let ; and it would take a fnjall weekly paper,
such as was printed io his diftridt, two months
to print them, if nothing el(e were inserted.
Mr. Macon said, in to give
so much information, they would give none ;
for if the number proposed to be sent were to
be forwarded, he (hould expeit 10 hear of the
mail'being broken down. He hoped the-u
---fiul number would only be printed. He had
1*) objection to the publication; biU he did
not expect the question would have been
bro>ighr forward to-day.
Mr. Oris enquired whether the gentleman
from Vermont had not said these papers were
so trifling and unimportant, that no printer
would undertake to print them.
Mr I,yon repeated what he had said.
Mr. (j 1 lps moved to adjburn. The moti
on was negatived 43 to 36.
Mr. Ch \mp i.in was afionifhed at theoppo
fition made to the publication of the dispatch
es [The Speaker reminded Mr. C. that the
qVielÃon was as to the number to be printed."]
He was surprised that any objetlion Ihouid be
made to the number, especially as the addi
tional expence could be no objett. He tho't
it proper they (hould (peedily be pubjiftied ui_
order to do away the falfe hnpreiliqjM which
erroneous publications may have produced.
He did not underltand how gentlemen could
reconcile their wi(h for publicity, with their
opposition to the proposed publication.
The question waa firft taken for 3000 copies,
and negatived, there being only 14 for it;
then on jooo, and negatived 42 to 3S.
Mr. Tillinghast then moved for an ad
journment, which was negatived, there be
ing only 27 for it.
The question then returned on 1200.
Mr. Macon moved to strike out 1200, and
insert the usual number ; which after some
observations from Mr. Bayard in favour of
having 1200 copies, was negatived.
The question tvas then put and carried on

T"HE STAN DâNo. 11.
The description of vice, by a celebrat
ed poet, may aptly be epplied to the revo
lution art government of France. It is
ââA monster of such horrid mien,
As to be bated, needs but to be 'seen."
Unfortunately, however, for mankind, a
species of moral pestilence has so far difor-
dered the mental eye of a considerable por
tion of it, as to prevent a diftinft a view of
. the deformities of this prodigy of human
wickedness and folly. It is the misfortune
I of this country in particular, that too ma
ny among its citizens have seen the monster
f in all its dreadful transformations with com
placency or toleration. Nor is it among
the least of the contradictions -of the hu<
r man mind, that a religious, moral and sober
people (hould have regarded wrth indulgence
t so frightful a volcano of atheism, depravity
and absurdity ; that a gentle and humane
s people (hould have viewed without deleftati
' on, so hateful an s inftrument of cruelty and
blood(hed ; that a people having an enlight
n ened and ardent attachment to genuine lib
erty, (hould have contemplated without hor
ror so tremendous an engine of despotism
j' and slavery. The film indeed begins to be
j removed, but the vision of many of those
"who have been under its influence is not yet
d restored to the necessary ?nergy or, clear
ness.
II It is of the last importance to our nati-
onal fafety and welfare, that the remaining
s obictirity (hould be speedily dispelled. Till
this shall be the cafe, we (hall stand on the
Urink of of a precipice.
To exhibit the hydra in all its horrible
' pre-eminence of guiltjrand mifchief, would
J require volumes. Slight (ketches chiefly to
pourtray its chara&er in reference to other
e nations, are all that will comport with the
e plan of these papers.
In retracing the progress of a war which
r has immersed Europe in blood and calamity,
it is an error as common as it is strange, to
acquit France of refponfitility, and throw
f the whole blame upon her adversaries.. This
t is a principal source of the indulgence which
t is (hewn to the extravagances and enormities
1 of her revolution. And yet the plained
faÂ£ts demonstrate, that the reverse of this
supposition is far more agreeable to truth.
e It required all the bold imposing pretences
h of the demagogues of France, all the docile
1. partiality of a warm admiration for her re
- volution, to have secured a moment's success
* to so glaring a deception.
e The origin of the war is ufnally charged
. to the treaty of Pilnitx, and to the counter*
d revolutionary projefts of the'parties tb it.
t To this day we are without authentic and
- accurate evidence of the nature of that trea
r ty. Taking its existence for granted, there
~ is not the least proof that it compfbhended
i, any other powers than /luftria, Prujfia aiid
t Sardinia.* Beyond these, therefore, un
e less suspicion be substituted for fad, it
could not afford even a pretext for hostility.
It is likewise certain,f that after the date
e afligned to the treaty of Pilnitx, the Em
-0 peror, who was the reputed head of the
confederacy, gave strong proof of the re
d nunciation of its objeft, if hostile to the re
s volution ; by fignifying, through his minis
ters, to all the foreign courts, his determi
-0 nation to acquiesce in the conftitutiou of
1792, accepted by Louis the XVI.
s The diplomatic correspondence between
1 France and /lujlria, which preceded the
' rupture, evinses that the treaty of Pilnitr.
was not the caule of the war, for it is not
e even mentioned. The immediate ostensible
I cause, as it there appears, was the (efufal
. of Austria to difarra in Compliance with the
r peremptory demand of France ; a demand
I ' ~~ /
/ am not certain that ever Sardinia tvas a party*
Writing frtm memory some minute circutnfanco may bt
; mijlated.
, f See State pa**- by Dcbrcuto which this, apparently, very rcjfonah'e i
reply was givenâthat France had previotif- J
ly armed to a greiter extent ; and that Auf- (
tria could not faftly reduce her Force while j
France remained in so diftilrhed and inflam* j
ed a (late as to leave her neighbors every mo- i
ment exposed to the enterprises of hÂ£r revo- j
lutionary fervor. There is no absolute cri- (
terion by which it can be pronounced w'ne- I
ther this reply was merely a pretext, or the '
dictate of 3 feriotis apprebf nfion. But it is ,
certain th*t the correspondence difcovjrs
great appearance of candor an J modention I
on thetpart of the Imperial cabinet ; and it ,
is not to be denied, that the state of effer
vefctnce of the French nation at this junc
ture furniiheJ real cause of alarm to the
neighboring governments.
It is then at belt, problematical, whether
France in declaring war, as (he did at the
fame time against AuHria and Prvjfia, was
afbiatcd by the convi&on that it was Beceff
ary toanticipate anddifconcert the unfriend
ly views of those powers ;or whether the
war, as has been suggested with great pro
bability, was fought by the republicans par
ty as a mean ofÂ«mbarrafling the executive
government, and paving the Way for the
overthrow of the royalty. Two things, well
e(lÂ»yi(hed, are inftrti&iveon this point. The j
tine, that the icing was driven against his
wiiTi, by a ministry forced upon him by the
popular party, to propose the declaration of
war, he cbnfidered as the tomb of
his familyâthe other, that Brissot, the
head of the then prevailiog fafti'on, fame
time .ifterwards exultingly buafted, th.St "
but for this war the revolution of the tenth of
Augnfl would never have taken place ; that but
for this war, France <u>oit!d never have been
a republic* 3
Admitting, nevertheless, that the true
source of the war with Austria and Prnfiia
is inveloped in some obfeurity, there is none
as to the wars in whieh France beewne sub
sequently engaged. It is clear as to them
that (he was the original aggreflbr.
It appeared from cotemporary testimony
lhatone of the 'rfta&sof that alfembly which
dethroned the king, was in a paroxilm of
revolutionary frenzy, to declare kfelf" A
COMMITTEEOFINSURRS.CTION ofthe whole
human race, for the putpofe of overturning
all exiftinggovernmeni."âThis extravagant
declaration surpasses any thing to be fo>nd
in the ample record of human maflnefs. It
amounted to an aft of hoftihty against man
kind. The republic of America, no less
than the despotism ef Turkey, was included
in the anathema. It breathed that wild and
exceflive spirit of fanaticifm, which would
scruple no means of eftablilhing its favorite
tenets ; and which, in its avowed objeft,
threatening the diforganizationof all govern
ments, warranted a uiiverfal combination to
destroy the raonftrous system of which it
was the foul.
The decrees of the -19 th of November
and 15th December 1792, were modifica
tions of the tame spirit. firft offered
fraternity and afliftance to every prople who
(hould wifli to recover their liberty, and
charged the executive power ta fend orders
to their generals to give that afliftance, and
to defend those citizens who had been or
might be vexed for the caule of liberty.
The last declared that the French nation
would treat as enemies any petple who, re
filling or renouncing liberty and equality, were
deiirous of preftruing, recalling or entering
into accommodation with their prince and
privileged cajls.
The firft was a general signal, to in-
and Revolt. It was an invitation
to the seditious of every country, in pur
suit of chimerical schemes of more perfeft
liberty, to confp'ire under the patronage of
France against the eftsbiiflied government,
however free. To assist a people in a rea
fojrable and virtuous, struggle for liberty, al
ready begun, is both juftifiable and lauda
ble ; hut to incite to revolution every where,
by indiscriminate offers of ailiftance before
hand, is to invade and endanger the foun
dations of social tranquility. There is no
term of reproach or execration too strong
for so flagitious an'attempt.
The last of the two decrees is not merely
in fprtitâit Is in terms equivalent to a man
ifefto of war against every nation having a
prince or nobility. It declares explicitly
and formally, that the French nation will
treat as enemies every people, who may desire
to preserve or restore a government of that
charadkr. ,
Iris impofiible not to feel the utmost in
dignation against so presumptuous and so
odious a measure. It was not only to scat
ter the embers of a general conflagration in
Europeâit was to interfere coercively in
the interior arrangements of other nations
âit was to di&ate to them, under the pe
nalty of the vengeance of France, what
form of government they should live under
âit was to forbid them to pursue their po
litical happiness in their own wayâit was
to set.up the worst of all despotisms, a des
potism over opinion, not against one nation
but agarnft almost all nations. With what
propriety is the interference of the powers,
ultimately coalesced against France, in her
interior arrangements, imputed to them as
an. unpardonable crime, when her leaders
had given To terrible an example, and had
provoked retaliation as a mean of felf-pre
fervation
These decree* preceded the tranfa&iont which
immediately led to a rupture between France & the
other powerÂ®, Anuria and Pruflia Â«xcepted.
It is idle to pretend, that they did not furnifh
to those porrers just caufo of war- There is no
rule of public law better established or on better
grounds, than that when one n tion unequivocally
avows maxims of coodu& dangerous to the secu

lg MR. DUNNING,
nt I perceive by your two last papers, that
id the Jacobins in this part of the Hate, have
It grown very busy about the politics of the
n- country. It is very obvious what they
â¢fs would be at. The time approaches when
â¢d we rauft make a nomination for reprefenta
id tives in Congress. In order to frightÂ«n us
Id into their schemes, they tell us that the com
te neftion between the United States and
3;, France mud be broken up, unless we will
n- consent to lick the dust at the feet of our
to Si/ler Republic, as Ihe used to be pleased to
it call herfelf. It is beyond controversy, that
there is a co-operation between the French
er government and the anti-federalifts in this
a- country. The treatment which our Com
td miflioners have received, clearly proves
10 thisfaft. They have probably been waiting
id to feel the pulse of the present Congress, in
rs 6rder to determine what to prescribe to Â«s ;
id and taking encouragement from the appear
or ance of" their party, have treated our envoys
y. with great infolencd and difgraee. We have
31, not many democrats in this state, and what
â  e _ there are, generally, 3re very infigniScant
rc creatures. But they are breaking out in all
ig the newspapers at once, in order to make
[id , us believe that the people at large are uneasy
with the government, and ripe for sedition.
n _ For this purpose, as a most important step,
3n and without which they know they can do
r _ nothing, they are addrefiing themselves to
ft the Farmers, if poflible to excite among
of j them jealoufies and clamours, a
t, j gainst the measures of government, and e
â a. ; specially against our own leprefentatives.â
| Before the landed interest, which i> the
| a _ j strength and liability of our government,
- e> will pay any attention to fuchan incendiary
ITe as. wrote a long piece addrefTeJ to the farm
n- ers, in your last paper, they will certainly
no pause, and make a few enquiries of them
:ig selves. Perhaps those enquiries may be like
the following :
'y ift. What is this government, which we*
n- are told is about to cru/h and enslave us ?
; a We formed a Constitution a few years iince,
jy and adopted it. We very soon found the
if benefit of it Our farms were will cultivat
re ed, because we had nothing else to attend
iat toâthey produced plentifully, because they
were well cultivated, and becault God blell
n- the labors of honest iaduftryâthis produce
brought us a good price, and ready pay,
lf - because our country was at peace, and our
ln merchants flourilhedâwith the avails we
ln paid our trifling taxes, supported and edu
-113 cated our familiesâdifcharged what little
â¢e- debts we owed, and laid up fometlung eve
at ry year. From whence then this noise a
er bout oppression ? This outcry against the
o- government ? The government is the fame,
as What does it all mean ? Did not a party
"f- spring up a few -years ago, ahd do all in
30 their power to make us join the Freneh and
at fight half Europe ?, We flill recolleft it.â
' s Â» Who were of this party ! The newspapers
er told ( us a good many names which we have
a ' not yet forgotten. Have not these people
rs been difappoiuted in their plan ? Yes. Our
id government, bad as it is, has kept us out
e ~ Â»f war yet. Are not the fame perform, who
have all along endeavored to make us join
France, the lame who are now preaching
to us, that we are upon the point of being
;(h enslaved ?
n Â° r 2nd- Who are the people whs have been
11 so long trying totrufii us, and bntigusun-
U- dera king ? was it George Wasainoton .'
to He was at the head of our government eight
m years, and bid out the pÂ»ih which his fuc
ccfiors are following. We-have always
f thought better of him. He always appear
ed to love his country, and did more for it
:ir than any other man. But it is fiid our own
â as representatives joined in the scheme.
"f Who are these representatives ? did sny of
them come from Geneva,- or lieland, or
France? Were they not born, and educat
ed in the coontry among ourfplves ; and
hare thiy not families, relations, frtendj,
and neighbors, which mtift all enfLved,
as well as we J Fur how long a tirxe are
they chosen ? Two years. What will be
come of tbem then ? They siiill come home,
and be enslaved with the reft of us. We
are well acquainted with our r*prefetitatives,
did we ever hear them fay any thing about
introducing kings into the country ?
3d. Why is it we are so often reniindeJ
of France I What is France to us i Will
the French buy our country produce, and
pay for it when-they have done ? Do they
(hew any disposition to pay our merchants
for ail the veflels and cargoes which they
have plundered from thetn J If we form an
alliance with them what may we expeft ?
Have not all the nations in Europe, with
whom have had much connexion, been o
verwhe'imcd, pillaged, and destroyed ? Is it
not a strange tiling in the world that in this
country it (hould not only be no offence to
abuse, villify and flandtfr OHr own govern
ment, and countrymen, but that it (hould
be deemed meritorious ; -but if any man
dares to speak against the French, even for
their haughty, proud spirit, their depreda
tions, their bloodlhed, and all their other
monstrous cruelties, he is abused, infill ted,
and perhaps beaten.? I might a(k questions
much.longer, but at present I will forbear.

COUNCIL OF FIVE HUNDRED.
January 21.
The membeis met at two o'clock in the
new hall built for the council in the PaVais
dk' la revolution, formerly called Palais
Bourbon.
The interior of the hall offers a semi-cir
cle, around which the feats of the deputies
rife in foi'm of ati amphitheatre : the latter
are bordered by a co'.onade of the lonian
order, of white speckled stucco, and of an
elegant design, behind which are the galle
ries for the fpc&ators. This colonade sup
ports a dome* wherein are large niches and
within t.hefe the rnoft celebrated legislators
of antiquity and /cveral emblems of liberty
and equality are painted. There are no
windows in the hall, but fufficient light en
ter? by an opening at the top of the dome.
The whole interior of the hall is sncruft
ed with green stucco, reletabling that kind
of marble called Verde Antico. The doors
are of mahogany wood.
The bureau (the place where the Presi
dent and secretary lit) may pass for a mas
terpiece. It is placed in the centre of the
semi-circle. The interval between the bal
luftrade and the rostrum forms a superb vef
tuible of'mofaic-, and precious marble.
The rostrum and the bureau, as well as
the steps which lead thereto, aic of speck
led marble, and the whole is adorned with
several statues and emblems of white marble
of exquisite workmanship. In the front of
the rostrum, attrafts more particularly the
eye, a figure of history with her pencil,
and renown preparing to found her trumpet.
Between these figures rises a zocle bearing
the figure of Liberty and that of Janus.
Tile deflc which has almoit the ferm of a
cube, is of the fineft mahogany j the tabic
is supported by four gildfd carriathides,
The chair of the Prefidpnt is likewise of
mahogany, and its borders gilded. A ve
ry fine drapery of green marble and of an
antique form adorns the circular purlieu,
where the bureau is placed.
This hall, the fit'ft that has been built
according to the rules ef art for a deliberat
ing aflembly, does honor to the talents of
the citizens Lecomte and Gifors the chief
architects. The workmanlhip of the rostrum
alone, would be fufficient to secure a dif
tinguilhcd reputation to citizen Lemot, a
young sculptor, who executed it.
The council preeeded by its u(hers, enter
ed the hall, amidst discharges of the artille
ry and patriotic music executed by the band
of the grenadiers of the legislative body.
The members having taken their feats, the
president pronounced the ' inauguration
speech which related chiefly to fubjefts ana
lagous to the feftival of the 21ft January.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Nov. 30.
The French frigate La Serieufe arrived
here on the 22d inft. In her paflage to this
place !ne disembarked a reinforcement of a
bout Sixty Cisalpine troops in the I Hand of
' Cerigo, which is now in poficflion of the
French, and divided into municipalities as
well as the Tino, one of- the Cyclades :
The movements in the latter island give the
me ft serious apprehension to the Divan.
About the end of Oiflober the frigate La
Caroline arrived there from Toulon with
arms, ammunition and Executive Commlf
t lionets. of the islanders have
since that time been embodied as national
guards : the tri-color flag is flying at St.
Nicholo, Port-Jofepho and all the other
parts of the islands ; this new fpe&acle and
the report of a plan of re-eltablifiiing the
freedom and splendor of ancient Greece,
has in a manner eledtrificd the inhabitants of
the Turkish islands in the vicinity. It has
already been reported here, and is general
ly bel'eved that deputations have been fttit
to the French commissioners at Tino by the
Greeks of Candia, Naxos and several other
Islands, in the neighborhood.

an impudence unparalleled, calls Charles Pii>ck

had no right to have sent hiin. All this, and

LEXINGTON, (Ken.) February 27.
We are informed that on Monday the
inft. the house and store of Mr. Even Fran
cis of Waynefburg, in Clarke county, was
consumed bvan alarmingaccidentâThe cir
cumstances are as follows : A child of Mr.
Francis' having obfepved people flafti pow
der to try its quality, had discovered where
a calk Hood in the store, which contained
about feventy-five pounds, lighted the end
of a stick in the fire, and put it in the calk,
which immediately blew up : the explosion
was so great, that it tore thehoufe in pieces
and threw a barrel of whiskey and some of
the goods that was in the store, a great dis
tance in the ftrectâthe child who was the
means of the aceident, and another child
of Mr. Francis' were killed ; Mr Francis's
wife and two young men who were in the
store dangerdufly burned, so that their lives
are despaired ol ; and a ysung woman who
was in the other end of the house much
hurt by a stroke from a piece of timber.*â
The melancholy circumstances attending
this dreadful accident, it is hoped will in
duce every person to guard against the like
in future.

INIO THE
ORIGIJ OF RPIDEMIG DISEASES.
THE Letters to Dr. Currie, whicii 1 puolilhed
last autumn, led me to an mveiligation of
the origin and phenomena of peftilsntial diseases
in other countries, as well as in the United St tcs.
In the profrcutioo of the fubjetS, new tails and
principles continually opeDed to my view, and fi
nally determined me to trace back the hifWy of
such diseases as far as the records of hilfory ex
tend. Foi* this purpose, I have examined the pub
lic libraries 111 New-York, New-Haven, Cam
bridge and Bollon, with a visw to obtain.a.l the
material fails which can illustrate the fubjiA.nnd
' I have nearly all the materials for the
proposed woi k.
The latfs eelbited will enable me to demon
' (Irate that many of the common ideas refpeSing
| pestilential epidemics, are unfounded or extremt
ly incorreil ; and this hi cOnsequence of medical
writers considering an epidemic disease as a detach
ed or isolated phenomenon in a a particular eoun
try ; rather than as conne&ed with other t pide
- ivies or other phenomena of nature in various
- parts of the world. The fa<sts f have collected
I lead to certain deductions which are surprising to .
- myfelf, and which will probably be new to many
, others. Much light will be thrown on this dark
, and p rplcxing fubjeit, as well aa on natural phi- .
â¢ lofophy.
The proposed work will make a full-fized o&a
---vo volume ; and executed well on fine paper, can
not be afforded at lets than two dollars, bound, .
* with the usual allowance to book-fellers. As thu
- compilation will coll not only great laber.but con
sider ble expince, no more copies "ill be printed
than to supply fubferibers. The book will be rea-
II dy for fubferibers early iu the coming summer, and
the holders of proposals will be good enough to
return them to No. 40, Pine-flreet, by the firtlof
May.

s author fufiicicnt to appal the stoutest heart.âThe
danger to be apprehended from secret focietiÂ«s is
clearly pointed out ; the degeneracy of human aa
les, ture awfully illuftratad, and the hazard of every
:e#, deviation irsm the straight path of religion and
c . of virtue, inconteflibly proved both to the politi
cian and the chriftiari by stubborn and incontro
