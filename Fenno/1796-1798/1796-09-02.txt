replete with objc&ions avifing from the enormous

;the p-w CoJliraiiTaries hare hastened to re- 1

btit the women, children and old men. In confe
qtience of which, they have been invited to enroll .
J themfslves for the two. flags of truce, which have
j been sent out ; declaring, that from that momeor,
every kind of ..ffiltance would be withheld : Very
e few have emfcraccd the opporttanity, because they
" had no asylum or resource, particularly in the nor
thern part of St. Domingo ; because women and
E | children could not be prevailed on to abandon their
their h'iffiands, their brethren, who thiglit
and proteded them in a country

Y lawlejs plunder. Thus, these unfortunate people, .

N. B. To favollr those who may take a quantity of
Tickets,the prize of 40,000 dollars will be the last drawn
ticket, and the 30,000 the last but one :
And approved notes, securing payment in either money
or prizes, in ten Jays alter drawing, will be received so
any number not less than 30 tickets. . <
This Lottery will afford an elegant specimen of the pri- 3
vate buildings to be eretfted in the City of
Two beautiful defigps are already fele&ed for the ent jr-'
fronts on two of the public ftjuares; from these prawiiws,
it is proposed to erect two fcentre and four corner building^,Â®
soon as possible after this lbttery is fold, and to convegM[
them, when complete, to the fortunate adventurers, in .
the manner described in. the scheme for the Hotel Lottery'. â¢ "1
A nett dedu&ion of five per cent, will be made to defray
the necessary expenses of printing, &c. and the surplus
will be made a part of the fund intended fÂ»r the National
University, to be erected within the city of Washington. 3
The Drawing will commence as soon as the tickets are
fold ofitâThe money prizes will be payable in thirty days
after it is finifhad ; and any prizes for which fortunate
numbers ate not produced within twelve months after the
drawing is dosed, arc to be considered as given towards
the funS for the University ; it being determined to fettle
' the whole business in a year from the ending of thtdraw-
ing, and to take up the bonds given as security. *
The real seCurities given for the payment of thefcizes,
are held by the President and two Dii;e<Jtors of thTOank
of Columbia, and are valued at more than half the a
mount of the lottery.
The twenty four gentlemen who by appointment of
the.late Commiflioners assisted in the management of the
Hotel Lottery are requested to undertake this arduous talk
a second time on behalf of the public ; a fufficient num
ber of these having kindly accepted, it is hoped that the
friends to a National Ãbiverfity and the other federal ob.-
jedÂ£3 may continue to favor the design.
By accounts received from the different parts of the
Continent as well as from. Europe, where the tickets
have been sent for sale, the public ase assured that the
drawing will fpsedily commenae, and that the care and
caution unavoidably necessary to insure a fafe disposal of
the tickets, has rendered the lhor fufpenfiop ihdifpenfable.
