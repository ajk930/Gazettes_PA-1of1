CONGRESS.
IJOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, June 13.
MR. CRAIK prefenteid an address from
Montgomery county, Maryland, ex-
of approbation of the conduct of the
Executive in its ocepemtion with the French
republic.âReferred as usual.
Mr. Gallatin, frÂ®ui the committee to
whom was referred a bill from the Senate to
authorize the faie of certain lands between
the Great and Little Miami rivers in the ter-
Jritoi'y of the United States, north-weft of the
phio, and forgiving the pre-emption ro cer
tain purchasers 3nd fetrlers ; and the bill to
authorise a gra-.t of lauds to Stephen Mbnot,
find other inhabitants of Gal'.ipolis therein
named, reported that the former ought to be
palled with amendments, and the latter with
out. The bills were committed.
Mr. J. Parker, from the committee to 1
.whom was referred the biU to alter the time j
making entry on (tills, as the
op nion of the committee that all the amend
ments ought to be agreed to, except one.
The Speaker informed 'he houle that the
hour was arrived at which a call of the house
u0 ordered, and that the clerk would pro
ceed to the call. He did so, when it appear
ed that ail the members were present but
three, except such as are absent on leave or
lick. Two of the three absent members ap
peared in the courfeof the lining, and on mak
ing apologies v. ere exciHed
she b'll providing tor the valuation of
houf.'S and lands and the enumeration ot
slaves within theUrired States, was then read
*he third time, and upon *he question being
put, " Shall this bill pass .
Mr. Dan is said, he was under the necefli
ty of oppolmg the parage of this bill. No 1
part of the community would contribute more
chcarfully, to 'lie extent of their ability, to
the support of the general government, than
his constituents ; but from the knowledge he
had of their situation, of the l'carcity ot circu
lating medium amongst them, from the want
of a market tor their iurplus he could
not give his vote in favour of a tax which it
would be with great difficulty they would be
able to pay. The people of Kentucky he said,
had produce of every kind, inabundance, but
they wont a market for it. The Mississippi
had a medium through which
tp transport it ; but as yet little advantage
has been derived from it ; and, whenever a
war thall take place, it may be expected that
t!>ey would be deprived of the advantages
which the free navigation of that river pro
mises to the vwedern country.
Mr. f). said, when he came from home, he
did not think the coin in circulation in Ken
tucky amounted to 10,000 dollars, and since
that period, he was informed that money had
become dill morefcarce. If he thought the
tax would be paid without great difficulty, he
would .have cheerfully voted for it ; but be
lieving the contrary, he was condrained to
give his vote against it.
Mr. W. Claibornf. (aid, the people of
TenneflTee, are, in a great degree linnlarly li
tuated with thole of Kentucky. Every one
enjoyed the neceUar.es of life, but few of
them experience thoie conveniences which
jflow from wealth. Money is a scarce article
amongii them ; and when he reflected upon
the present fttuation of things, and the proba
bility there is that the avenue which is lately
opened forthe.difpofildf the surplus produce
ofrhe date, will soon be closed, he feared
his condituents would be illy able to pay this
tax. But if, as the gentleman from N. Caro
lina (fylr. Ma.coÂ«j)>ona former occasion filg
geded, be Ihoud be mifiaken in this respect, J
and that tUe people of Tenneflee arc well a- |
ble the tax, he ihould rejoice in the
event. Fearing thecontrary, however, when
he heard the people complaining of th s griev
ous burthen, he w-ihed to have th? confolfi
tion 0/ faying, il I did not to this
law," because I.was of opinion that its ope
jation would be particularly opprellive to the
wedern people.
Mr. ,G.a i la tin observed, it would beex
troiTvel-y difficult to point out any mode of tax -
tttion which will not be inconvenientÂ«and op
prertive in feme decree to fume parts of the
people to pay ; a; d it must be expected that
every mode whifch can be adopted, will bear
more hardly on lome parts of the community
ttun on dthers. With respeCt to the tax on
land, he mud agree with the gentlemen from
Kentucky and lenncliec, that from their be
ing a less quantity of circulating medium in
their dates than any other (tare of the union,
if would probably fall heavier upon their con -
fUtuents than up. n people of the Atlantic
it ares. But there is one consideration, with re
ipeft to those dates, wh eh oufrht to be taken
into consideration, viy.. that the tax for this*
year will be laid according to the old census,
tal;en (even or eight years ago, lince which
time it is well known that the population of
these has more than doubled. There
fore, the inconvenience of paying this tax
will bk grctu I y to these dates by that
circumltauce. In the state of Tennellec, by
iheold census taken in 1791, there were only
35,c00 inhabitants, whereas by acenfuS tak
cn in that (tpre by theinfelves two years agp,
/the number exceeded 60,000.
Beiides, it appeared to hi:n that both the
-gentlemen atfumed a principle, by no means
â¢ afcertaiiied, viz. that the Miifiliippi will be
ihortlv closed to the western country 1 . No
people could fuffer more by such an event
jrhanthe people whom he himfeif represented.
1 hey itood prec fely in the fittYation of the
conftitileiits of those gentlemen ; and un
doubtedly if our preipnt difficulriei with
prance mould produce a war vVith Spain, it
would be extremely fatal to his conltituents
AS well as theirs. But he knew of 110 reason
i\Â»r Itippoling th s ; and it would be Wrong to
legillate on a presumption that such will be
the cafe.
In relation to this law, it wasviot formed
Mr. G. said, altogether to Ivs wish ; but it
wjs :h nearly foas he could get it, and it was
necetmy the money should be railed. He had
oppofeel as long and as forcibly as he was able
mo(t of the meaiures which made the great ex
feuces iff the j>refent fellion necellary ; but a
majority having determined that theexpence
flÂ»;iM be incurred, and that meaiures shall be
ujeen which will ucceflarily decreafeour pre
ienf reyemie, it is become the duty of
nu nbcrto urov.de rlie means for paying t!.e
t-\ i to be incurred, and forfupplying the
pf. oablc deliciencics offorjjer revenues.
if theexpence Uto be provided for, how is
it 10 be done ? It mud be either by tax at on
By John Fen no, NÂ°- 119 Cbefmit Street.
PHILADELPHIA: THURSDAY EVENING, JULT 5, 1798
or by loans. Indeed, it is probable Congress
will be obliged to resort to loans, even during
the pr.efent felfion ; but certainly it is their
duty, as for as they aVc able, to provide for
the public expences, into mea
iures which Wjll increase the public debt.
Our choice lies, therefore, betwixt loans and
taxation, and however inconvenient it may be
to the people to pay ta.xcs, he fbould certain
ly resort to raxes than loans. And if the mo
ney is to be raised by taxes, to what objeists
can we turn our attention ? Congress mud
have recourse to internal revenue, or an in
crease of duty 011 the importation of foine of
the neceflTaries of life. Indeed, after turning
his attention very ferioudy to the subject, he
could not find how any considerable revenue
could be raised, but by means of a direct tax
on land and houfes,ora tax on fait. He did
not think any other could be relied upon ;
and between the tiyo, he believed it would be
infinitely better, both for the United States
and his condituents, to lay a tax on laiid and
houses, than on fait. The tax on land and
houses will be laid according to the value ot
the property ; and though there is less circu
lating medium in the back country, which is
thinly fettled, than in the large towns, the pro
perty in those parts wil! be at a much
lower rate, and ofcourfe the people will have
a smaller proportion of the tax to pay ; and
he thought ir far preferable to lay a tax which
would tall, in a great degree, upon persons
according to their wealth, than one which
would operate as a poll tax, as a tax on fait
would do, according to tfycir number.
Mr, G. said, he was of opinion that an an<-
nual tax would be fufticient, and that we need
not have recourse to loans.
It was neceflary, Mr. G. said, at all events,
that this biil Ihould pass ; for if it could be
proved that our revenue would be fnfiicient
Â» ir this year, it would be a good argument
why the tax fliould not be laid for this year,
but not againd making the valuation of pro
perty propded by this bill ; for, if war takes
[ place, it will bi convenient to have this va
luation made, upon which a tax may be l>*id.
Therefore, though he knew it would prove
inconvenient to feme of his condituents, as
well as to those Â®f the gentlemen from Kentuc
ky and Tennelfee, he would nevertheless vote
for the palling of this bill.
Mr. Harper had the pleasure ofbeing per
suaded in his own mind, from the fmaTl perfo -
nal knowledge he had of the Wedern Coun
iy, that the gentlemen from that part of the
country represent as little the true situation,
as they do the real convenience of their con
dituents. He could not persuade himfeif that
the people of the States of Kentucky and
Tennellee would be unable to pay this tax,
and dill less, that those people would be rea
dy to lay their rights and independence at the
feet of a foreign power, sooner than pay for
the defence of them. The o.bjeftion made
to this tax, is not that it i$ improperly laid,
or as being unnecelTary for the defence of our
country. It is not said that the objects which
Congress have already undertaken for the de
fence of the country, cat) be provided for in
any other way ; but the house is told that the
people tvill be unable to pay this taxâtheir
proportion of the ex pence of measures which
are neceilary for the defence of their rights
and liberties. This was a da'ement whichhe
was certain the people of those dates will ne
ver allpw to be correct. He believed it to
be founded altogether in midake, and he be
lieved it would be prcved to be so, by the
prompt manner in which people will pay 1
this tax. He had no duubt the gentleman ;
who made this datemjent thought it weil
founded ; but he believed they had fuffercd
fears to blind them : for he never would
believe whdd heconfidered them Americans,
; and hijnlelf one, that the people of those
! dates will lay that they arc unable to pay their
I share of the expence of the defence of their li-
I b rties. No ; they will spurn the idea, and
; prove tbemlelves worthy of enjoying that li
j berty, which they assisted to obtain with their
blood, by declaring that they aru able and
wilting to contribute their portion in the de
fence of their country. He would not hint
j icli lo far insult them, as to fugged the idea
; ot exempting them from the payment of their
diare of tUe expence of that defence, much
less to insinuate that they would place thein
felves in the situation of paupers, and claim
to be exempted. On the contrary, he woud
repeat it, that they would pay their shares of
this expence with cheerfulnefs ; and
venture to fay, that in nuking titis declarati
on, he represented the feelings of the people
of thole States better than their immediate
representatives, who affer ed the contrary ;
and he was willing to reft his credit upon the
avowal.
Mr. Davis said, he believed he could
prove to the gentleman from Pentifylvania
(Mr. Gallatin) that his conditions with res
pect to the ability of the people of the date of
Kentucky to pay this tax, were not altoge
ther correct ; and that the number of the peo
ple inhabiting the date now, beinÂ£ double
what it was when the lad census was taken,
will afford them no relief. For if there were
10,000 dollars in circulation in the date, when
there were only 30,000 inhabitants, and no
more now thare are 150,'00, the tax would
fall no lighter now than it would have fallen
then. How, it might be enquired, does it
happen, that though the population is so
greatly increased, no increase Ihould have
been made in the quantity of circulating fpe
cie ? It happens thus. Men who emigrate
tram the Atlantic States to this country, sel
dom bring much money with them ; for what
ever they may have when they let out, it is
expended on their journey, or paid for land
to a single person when they reach us, so that
none ot their money comes into general cir
cular on; and though the people are able to
raise plenty of produce, they are not able to
exchange it for money. It is true, the more
inhabitant? they got, the more the general
property ot the date is increased, but it did
not increase the circulating medium. He did
not believe there is now so much money in
circulation, as there was when thecenfuswas
taken. There was then an army there, and
produce fold for a g<>od price; but since a
peace was made with the Indians, 'money has
been constantly draning oft* from the date, to
pay the debts which the mercltants of that
date had contracted whild trade was bnfk in
this and other cities.
Therefore, as personal property is not fax
ed, as tlu- people who go there carry with
them no llaves, and as tlier<- are tracts
of unapproj t a'ed land which the State has
let cut free from taxes, and which will not
pay any part of this tax, the people of Ken
ucKy wi.o will have to pay this tax, will not
be much relieved by the Sates increased po
pulation.
The gentleman from Pcnnfylyania fays his
conHituents would feel the fame inconveni
ence from the doling of the navigation of the
riyer Miflillippi, that the people in the Wef- j
tern States would feel. This he did not think
correct ; for though it would be very incon
venient tor the pfeople on the other lide of the ,
Alleghany to carry their produce to an eifler
ly market, they could nevertheless do it; but
from the State of Kentucky, it would be iin
pollible for produce to be sent from thence to
the Atlantic cities; they mu.ft, therefore,
trade down the Miffiflipni, or not at all.
As to the gentJe.lll an from S. Carolina, he
did not believe lie either represented the feel
ings of the people of "Kentucky or Tenneflee,
or knew their interests ; though it is not the
firlt time lie had heard that gentleman H-fluwe
to himfelf more knowledge than every body
e!fe. lie denied that he represented the lee
lings of his constituents. On the contrary, he ;
was persuaded, that he himfelf nad represen
ted them truly, when he fa id', that they will
be willing to pay any tax for the i'upport of
the General Government, which they are able
to pay; but he doubted, from his intimate
acquaintance with their circumHances, *
| ther they would be able to pay.this tax, and
; on thisaccount it was that he proposed to voje
again# it. He did not come here, as the gen
tleman from S. Carolina had represented, to
claim an exemption from this tax for his coo-
Hituents,'on account of their poverty. He |
Ihould vote against the bill, becaule he knew
it would fall opprellively on his conHituents, â¢
and the gentleman from S. Carolina Jis wel- j
come to all the credit which he can obtain for :
a Her ting the contrary. But every person in ]
the lea It acquainted with the Star.i trona which ]
lie came mult know that the people cannot
command money, though they have an abun
dance of produce. When he lett home, he
could have purchased ahy quantity of Indian
corn at half a dollar a barrel; but men with
their (tores full of produce, could not, per
haps, produce a dollar incalh. Another rea
son why money is so scarce is, that during the
Indian War, merchants sent out quan
tities of goods, and when peace was made (he
people were much indebted to the merchants,
which they had been compel led to pay as fait as
they could c*Jlecfc it, and the merchants there
had sent oft' the money to discharge their
debts here and in other places, as he had al
ready dated.
Mr. W. Claiborne rose ; when
The Speaker delired he would confine
himfelf to the queltion before the houle, as
the gentlemen who had already spoken, had
wandered very much from the subject.
Mr. C. hoped he Ihould be permitted to
make a few remarks upon what had fallen
from Hie gentleman from S. Carolina. The
eloquence ef that gentleman all mull allow is
great ; but it mult also be admitted that he
does not always apply it to the mod proper
purposes. He has rold the house that he (Mr.
C.) as the representative of the {tote of Ten
neflee misrepresents the feelings of his confli
tuents; as attributing to them sentiments
which they will despise.
TheoPEAKER laid the geritleman from S.
Carolina did not fay so ; di/wvoiv was the word
he used and Mr. C. changed the word accor
dingly.
That gentleman has observed, that the peo
ple of '1 eiinelfee will confifkr this as a quelti
un whether they will fuffer their rights and
independence to be abandoned to a foreign
power. Theie remarks had no weight upon
ins inind. Mr. C. laid, he had Hated, and
Hated truly, that the people of Tennell'ee
would be illy able to pay a land tax of
which this bili lays the foundation. He never
represented them as willing ro abandon their
rightsand independence. Were h? to throw
out any such idea he llioujd calumniate the
people whom he represented. They have lit
tle treasure to bring forward for the fejrvice of
the public, but they have valiant blood to !
Ihed ; and when the queltion ft)ail arrive whe- \
ther thts country fhallgive up its In dependence > \
if the gentleman of S. Carolina and lie Ihould
live to that period, he doubted but they
would fee the people of I enneiiee amonglt
the foremoH, in the ranks to defend it. Dulce j
eji propatriamoriy was a laying, tlie truth ot
which, the freemen of that ltate admitted, and !
he had 'he happineis to believe, that they
would think itjiveet to die for. their country.
The gentleman from PeririfylvE.ua (Mr.
Gallatin) had laid, that the measures which
had chiefly created % tbe neceflity tor this tax
had not met with his approbation. He could
himfelf fay the fame thing ; but a majority of
the American Government having thought
them proper, he Ihould do all in his power to
carry them intoefte&j and, On his return home,
he Ihould think it hid duty to endeavour to re
concile his neighbours to the ltate in which
they would of courie place us. But he could
not, as their Representative, believing as lie
did, that they will be less able to pay this tax,
than any other that could be impoled, and
that it will be found extremely burthenfome,
vote for this bill. The gentleman from Penn
sylvania had truly Hated that Tenneflee had
greatly increased in numbers lince the taking
of the laltcenfus ; but though this is true, it
is not consequently true that the State has
greatly increased in wealth. When the emi
grants from the Atlantic States firfl leave
home to go to that ltate, they have fonie pro
perty; but is is generally expended on their
journey, or for the purchase of land on their
arAval,as had been justly represented by his
triendtrom Kentucky. Now and then indeed,
a person of wealth came amongst them, but
the emigrants to. the Western' Country, gene
rally came in feaich of an asylum from pover
ty and diltrefs. It may be, that in the courie
of a few years, provided his constituents could
have a vent for their produce, the State of
Tenneflee may become wealthy. When that
(ball be the cale, he was certain they would
pay the tax cfteatltilly, without cbuiplair.t.
Ho looped to fee the day when this State lhall
vie with its litter Hares in wealth and lonfe
qucnce ; but at present being in her Infancy,
he was afraid this tax v ouldot all others prove
tlie molt burthenfome to many of his confli
tuents. But if the gentleman Iron S. Caroli
na had (uppoied that his oppolition so this
tax arose troma wiMipgnefs in linn or conHi
tuents, to fur render the independence of this
country to a Foreign Power, he had greatly
wronged both him and them.
Mr. S. Smith did not think the fears of
the gentlemen from Kentucky and Tennell'ee
would be realized. It is no doubt true that
ihe quantity ot circulating fpecle in Kentrc
ky had di mini Ihed lince the peace with the
Indians j but it is alio true that the spring
trad? this year from Kentucky by the Miflif
iippi has been both great and profitable. But
gentlemen fuppofc, if we have a war with
France, wje lhall also be at war with Spain,
and our inrerctSurfe by that riv.ci\will be cut
otf". But the interest of Spain will be againll
this; for Â«n cafe of war, there wiU be great
difficulty in getting flour to the Ilavanoah
from the Atlantic ports, as our Welt India
trade will be cut off, and they will have to
depend upon a lnyiply by the Miflillippi.
fides, it produce be so much cheaper in [he
Western Country than in the Atlantic
as it has been flaied to be, it will become khe
interest of neutrals in the Atlantic cities, to
make by produce from that coun
try to the Havannah. And if Spain ftouldCbe
drawn into the war, there would be other
modes of the people of tliofe Hates difpoljng
of their produce. He did not rhink, there
fore, gentlemen from that country need be so
much alarmed as they appeared to be.
Mr. J. Williams had always been op
posed.to every fyHem of direct taxes ; but as
a majority of the House had agreed to call
forth the resources of the country by this
means, he mufl give his vote for this bill. He
was aflonifhed to find the gentleman from
Kentpcjty and Tenneflee oppoling this bill,
when so much of the money of ihe general
government had been expended in thajt coun
try. They niuH acknowledge their Hates have
had their portion of specie from the Treasury
of the United States. An aft had indeed beerr
patted during the present felfion for paying a
company of Militia for a certain expedition in
Tenneflee, which amounted to nearly one
fourth of the whole sum required from that
Hate. He believed fomeof the troops of the
United States are also now there, and likely
to continue, so that they are conHantly re
ceiving fuppliesof calh from the Treasury of
the United States. Besides, it ought to be
considered, that this tax will fall upon unim
proved, as well as improved land, many of
the owners of which, he supposed, lived out
of that Hate, which would reduce the portion
of the tax to the Hate. The diflriCt in which
he lived, Mr. W. said, would pay more tax
than the whole Hate of Tennelfee. He knew
the tax would be collected in some places
with difficulty, and more so, lince the bill
undergone a change, which had thrown the
tax upon land more than it would otherwise
have fallen.
But whatever difficulty may attend the col
lection of this t ( ax, when we fee the ruinous
effects of public debt in other countries, vye
ought to be cautious how we make extenlive
loans, and endeavour to draw forth the re
sources of the country, to meet any of the ex
pences which we may have to encounter.
M . Varnum flieuld vote against this bill. He
had always thought, since the ettablifhment of the
present government, that there would be no neccf
fity for resorting to direst taxes, except in cafe of
our being engaged in war. He believed the mea
sures already taken would not require a direst tax,
if no further expences were contemplated. But he
now believed a majority of the government of the
United States are determined on war, and he would
on that account have given his vote for the bill, if
the tax was proposed to be laid on just and equal
principles. It was his opinion that every species of
property ought to be taxed, as well as houses and
land. So far from this being the cafe, he believed
that betwixt one third and one half of the property
taxed by the State Legislatures, in their lyftem of
dire# taxes, would, by the present plan, be excused
altogether from tax. Some of the most wealthy
people in the Union would, by this means, bÂ« un
taxed, in a great degree, whilst perfms who hold a
small property in houses or land, will bear the bur
then of it; and not only of this tax, but to any fur
ther extent to which the government may have oc
casion to carry it.
Mr. T, Claiborne had opposed many of the
measures which made rhi>tax necessary; but a ma
jority of Congress having determi ed upon a certain
cotirfe of measures, however contrary they may be
to his opinion, he ihould cheerfully lubmit to them,
and vote in favour of this bill.
The people of Virginia, if they mud be taxed,
wished ro be taxed in .1 d:reft way, and ke doubted
npt this tax would be paid with alacrity.. They al
wÂ»ys had b cn, and would continue to be, he had
no doubt, prompt in their obedience to the laws of
the general government.
Mr. Lyon ihould vote against this bill. K-. 'iad
expe&ed that whenever the States ihould have beep
called upon to pay a diredt tax, they would have
been required to have raised their quota of the tax
in the way that Oiould jiave been most agreeable to
them. This, he laid, would have been a much more
economical way than the prelent. If the Hate of
Vermont hadbecn called upon in this way, he ?!oubt
ed not ihe could hive raised the money, at not more
than 2 pe ( r cent, upon the colle&ion ; whereas in
the way proposed, it is estimated to cost 25 'per
cent. He ihould not have objeqfccd to a direiSfc tax,
if properly cofle&ed; but he could not agree to this
txpenfive mode of doing the business.
The Yeas and Nays were then taken upon the
palling of the bill (as have already been given) and
it was pafled 69 votes to 19.
TkÂ« bill to authorize the defence of Merchant
VelTels againll Trench depredations; and the bill to
amend the aft to provide a Naval Armament, and
the aft to authorize the President of the U. States
to caufc to be purchased or built a number of small
ve(Teis, to be equipped as galleys or otherwifc, were
read the third time and pal Ted.
The amendments of the Senate to the hill fup
plementai y to the aft for providing an uniform rule
of naturalization, were taken up and agreed to.
Mr. Gallatin, from the committee to whom
w is referred the letter of Rufus Putnam, Surveyor
General of the United States, fuggclliiig the pro
priety of repealing that part of the law providing .
lor the sale of land north-well of the river Ohio,
which requires the north and i'outh lines &c. to be
run according to the true meridian, on account of
the difficulty attending it, roported it as their opi
nion, that it woukl be improper to repeal that part
of the law.
The fame gentleman, from the committee ap
pointed to enquire into what progress had been
made in the law for the sale of the North Western
Lands, andwji'ether any alteration ought to he made
in the laid law, reported it as the opinion of the
committee, that any alteration which may be pro
per in the above adt, ought to be poftponcd till next
l'eflion.
Both reports were committed.
The amendments of the Senate to the bill for the
better cpllefticn of certain internal â¢.Â». venues, were
committed'to a committee of the whole.

ON the birth diy of the United States,
and at an sera the mod intereding that haq
occurred since their exidence as a nation,
the Pennsylvania State S ciety of the Cin
cinnati dctire most refpeflfully to congratu
late and address yon.
Asa portion of that band, whose bed
efforts were employed to edablilh the sove
reignty and independence of our country,
we come, in the moment of impend nghol
tility, trf offer the remnant of our lives to
defend them.
The rights and privileges of America
were not purchased u ith the bed blood of
her citizens, to be inglorioufly surrendered
on the requisition of a foreign power.
No, Sir, the spirit which procured, sur
vives to protest themâAnd we rejoiae to
behnjd that spirit pre-eminently displayed
in the firm, virtuous and dignified condufl
of the Federal Chief Magidrate. Our citi
zensofall ages are emulous of this illustrious
example; the exert ons of our youth declare
that tliey have r.o degenerated, and afford
an unqi.edionable affu ance that their noble
inherrtancewillbe pre ft rved unimpaired, and
transmitted inv olate to poflerity.
The government of France, abandoning
every principle on which their revolution
was predicated, has exhibited a spirit of def
potif.n unexampled in the VtiSory of nations.
After perpetrating the tri"d unprovoked
and unjtiftifiable wrongs againll the people
of the United States, their rulers li3ve re
jetted the reiterated advances of our go
vernment towards an explanation of differ
ences ; they have fpurntfd cur messengers of
peace, and they have fuperadded insult to
injury, in the exaftion of an ignominious
tribute, which they hoped to extort by base
intrigue, er to enforce byimperious menace.
As Americans, and as men, having a
common inured in the welfare oftheworld,
we rejoice that these outrages againd its
happiness have been refilled.
To the prudence, moderation and libera
lityof those meafiircs of your aftminiftr.tion,
Sir, which we are convinced were lincerely '
direaed to the attainment of an honorable '
peace, we render the approbation of citi
zens wh - juflly appreciate that desirable po
fition. To your vigilance and virtue, which
have detefled and repelled the attempts of '
avarice and ambition, on the part of the '
French gov roment, against the United 1
Siates, weÂ»ffr the tribute cf an higher
applause. We defiie to express the cfteem
and gratitude of cit'zens, who hold every '
confideraiion as secondary toihe sovereign 1

the maintenance f which, and in support .
of every measure of our government that
may be deemed necessary to protest the r

The following Address of the Legifla-
ture of New-Hampshire to the l'refi
in j dent ofthe United States, was agreed
n ' to by the Hoqfe of Representatives,
136 members present, and four only
voting in the negative âin the Senate
(j it was unanimously adopted. \
Address Â»f the Legi/lature of New-Hampshire,
TO THE
PRESIDENT tj the UNITED STATES.
SIR,
AT a time when the American nation is
on the point of being drawn into the vortex
of European war, we flatter ourfelvea that
an address from the I.egiflature of New-
Hampshire will not be unacceptable.
' Permit us, Sic, to express our entire satis*
[l _ faftion in the wisdom and energy of your
adininiflration, and that of your predecessor.
unremitted perseverance whi' h has
c _ marked your endeavors to adjust and fettle
our disputes with France, difplavs, in the
I strongest colours, your desires of peace.
0 Although the political fituatio* of this
country is diflrefling and alarming j yet no
â a mea^ures on y our P art have been wanting
that could honorably render it otherwise.
We consider the inflriiftions given our En
voys as fufficient and ample for every pur
. pose of honorable and equitable negociation.
Q We feel the indignity that has been offered
them ; we feel, with resentment, the wrongs
and injuries done our commerce by French
depredations.
A firm requefl and dignified demand have
e not procured redress ; and we add, with re
-1 gret that we fear the apparent disposition
c of the government of France renders further
j Rtgociation unnecessary. We do not tax
ourfelvcs wirhjingratitude to the French na
tion ; that debt which wecontradled under
the monarchy of France, has antici
pated and paid to the executive govern- I
ment of that country ; and it will always
j be recollefted that we were the lirft nation
to acknowledge the republic of France.
It is with pleasure we contemplate the
increasing firmnefs of our national legisla
ture : by union our independence can be
r maintained ; by division it is loft forever.
' To divide and conquer, has been, we are
sensible, too oftÂ»n fuccefsfully praftifed, I j
to the deftru&ion of governments and ua- 1
tions j but we arc happy to assure you, that 1
the opposition in the state of New-Hamp- 1
(hire to (he adminifiration of the federal go- 1 J
vernment, is much too coutemptible to merit ; t
the name of division.
Although we deprecate the evilg and ; '
scourges of war; yet, Sir, we more sensibly \
feel the insults offered the dignity of our
country. Our independence was won and
eflablifhcd by the blood and fatigues of the
braveâit is a boon which we will never 1
facrifice at the shrine of foreign rapacious c
ambition. If declining Rome bought her '
peace of the ancient Gauls with money, yet J.
we shall never give our consent to pay a dif
graceful tribute to Guals more modern.- r
When our Country calls, our war-worn sol- t
diars, and the hardy youth of our hills, at
the firft found of the clarion of danger, will
cheerfully and unitedly rally round the "
flandard of American independence, and de- /,
fend it with their blood. The diforganizer t,
may seek for preteftion under the colours p
of France ; bu' as for us and our conllitu
ents, we will shelter ou-'felves under the
wings of the American Eagle. v
Accept, Sir, our united declaration ta 8
fupporc and defend the constituted authori- V
ties of our country with our lives and for- 8
tunes ; accept our warmed wishes for your [j
personal welfare and happiness : long may p
you continue to watch over the fafety of the '
community.

To the Legi/lature of Netv-Hampfhire. |
GENTLEMIN, |
My mod refpeilfuland affe&ionate thanks v
are due to your two honourable houses for t
an address transmitted to me by yonr excel- a
lent governor and presented to me by your 1
representatives in Congress. The American
nation appears to me as it do sto you, on 1
the point of being drawn into the vortex of 1
European warâyour entire fatisfa&ion in ' f
the adminiftratir.ll of the federal government 1
and in the perseverance which has marked 1
its endeavours to adjust our dilputes with '
France is very meâdiftreffing ,
and alarming as the political situation of this t
country is, lam confcious-that no meafuies t
on my part havfc been wanting that could 1
have honorably rendered it otherwise. The '
indignities which have been so repeat- '
edly offered to our ambassadors, the great- !
eft of which is the lad unexampled insult, ,
in choosing out one of the three, and t
discarding the other two, the wrongs 1
and injuries to our commerce, by French 1
depredations, the legal declaration in 1
effeft of hostilities against all tur com- 1
merce and the apparent disposition of the ,
government of France render further nego
ciation not only nugatory but difgraceful 1
and ruinous You may tax the French gov- 1
ernment with ingratitude with much 1
justice than yourselves. The increasing u- '
nion among the people and their legislatures, !
is as encouraging as it is agreeable. The ,
piecept "divide and conqutr" was never 1
exemplified in the eyes of mankird in so flri- 1
king and remarkable a manner, as of late
in Europe I Every old republic has fallen 1
before itâif America has not spirit and :
sense enough to learn wisdom from the ex- 1
ample of* so many republican catastrophes I
paffm? in review before her eyes, (lie de- I
serves to fuffer and most ctftairly will fell. â 
lam happy to assure you, that as far as my '
| information txtends, the oppofiticn to the j
! federal government in all the other dates as
well aa in New Hampshire ia too small to 1
"(1 merit, tSensme of diTtfion ; it is a differ
tnee of fefitimcnton public meafuret, oat

ur The war-worn foldicrt, and the brate and
at hardy sons of New-Hamplhire, second to
none in Still, emerprize or courage in war,
will never iurreiidcr the independence, or

I return my warmed wifhesfor your health

I. JOHN ADAMS,
j Philadelphia, June 29, 1798.
S ' CONGRESS.
Tuefdav, the House of Representatives of
;e the United States, parted the bill further to
protett the Commerce of the United States,
46 votes being in favourofit.
Mr. Harper said, he held in his hand cer
'â¢ tain resolution? vyith refpefl to the defence of
the country, which he thought it would te
important to adopt; because he considered
Congress as having resolved upon repelling
is and resisting the pretensions of a power which
â¢ x he had no idea, and which he could not sup-
Jt pole any gentleman had reason to expect
would recede from the terms of tribute which
tliey had offered. Having therefore'a know
ledge ot the force, the pride, and the perfe
s- verance of oar enemy, whi Ift we are not dif
ir mayed by, their power and their spirit, we
r , ought to view it in all its magnitude, to pre
ls pare fora vigorous firugglein meeting it, and
I to redd the extravagant pretensions of that na
tion. That we maybe thus prepared, he of
c fered the following resolutions to the confide- I
"â¢ ration of the House :
Is Rofol<vrJ, That it is expedient to augment
0 the Provisional Army of the United Stares to
fifty thousand men.
, Resolved, That it is expedient to enable the
President of the United States to proceed,
whenever he ifaall judge it conducive to the
- public welfare, to the appointment of all the
1. Officersof the said Army, and the organiza
] tion of irs Staff: Inch Officers not to be on pay
s till called into actual service.
R.ifll'ved, That it is expedient ro enable the
1 President of the United States to raifc im
mediately, and bring into adhial service, one
e division of the said army, to confiftof not more
- than twelve thousand five hundred men.
j Resolved, That it isexpedient to enable the
r President of the United States te raise and bring
I into actual service, all or any part ot the rc
' 1 maining divisions of the said army, in cafe of
* i invasion of any part of the territory oftheUni
rl ted States, qr of imminent danger of such in
- ' vafion, in his opinion conceired to exist.
. | Rcfnhrd, Tlint it is expedient to enable
, t the President of the United States to raise
I immediately, and bring into aCUial service, a
1 | corps of non-commiflioned officers for those
1 divisions of the said army which may not be
; immediately raifsd : the (aid corps not to ex
ceed the number ot twelve hundred, and to
do duty asa separate corps of the army, until
their services in all or any of the said divisions
: shall be required.
RefcflveJ, That it is expedient to enable the Pr#-
fident of tfie U. Statei to obtain by purchase, loan or
other contract, for the use of the United States, any
number ef vefTels of war, not exceeding ten, in ad
dition to those heretofore authorized by law, and of
such force, not less than thirty-two guns each, as he
may judge advaritageo*s for the public service, and
I to man and equip the fame.
RefofotJ, That it is expedient,to enable the Pre
. fide t of the United States to cftablifh one or more
dock-yards for the use of the United States, with
; suitable buildings for marine stores, arsenals and
magazines.
Ordered to lie on the table till this day.
Mr. Livingston again laid the resolution
upon the table which he otfered and with
drew yesterday, prbpofingan address to the
President. He said he should not himfelf call
it up at present; but if any other gentleman
chose to do so, he should not object to it.
The Sysaxer said, that gentleman
must know that when a propofiti n is offered
to the House, it is offered for decifi'on,.
The queflion being loudly called for
Mr. Kittera wished to propose an amend
ment to this resolution, in the following
words, viz. " and in cafe the said Ermv/Jball
have been ordered out <if {he French Republic, or
taken into cuflody, then niiih such Other person or
persons as the French Directory may feleil."
Mr. Thatcher leconded the motion.
Mr. Harrison hoped the yeas and nays
would be taken upon this amendment. A
greed. f
Mr. N. Smith wai sorry thii motion was made. *
He thought it playing with treafou. Nor could he â¢
?';ivean affirmative vote on any amendment 10 so in-
amoiis a resolution. (rt call to O'der) He said he
should be conttruned 10 voteagiinft the amendment, c
piopofed, and vuh equalrcadinefs should voceigainlt
the resolution. t
Mr. Otis hoped the mover of this amend- '
ment would withdraw it. It could only have Â®
been intended to cafl acenfureupon the Refo- "
lutionâa censure much milder than he should
himfelf have been inclined to cast upon it, '
which having been done, he trusted the gen- f
tleman would not place his friends in so dif- -
agreeable a fituatiou as to be obliged to vote
upon it.
Mr. Kittera said, the house muit have '
seen his objeil in making this motion. The "
resolution which had been laid upon the table 1
by the gentleman front New York, was so ab- Â°
horrent to all his ideas of propriety, that he '
had taken this mode of (hewing his difappro-
bation of it, in the strongest manner in which c
he could do it. We have, said he, sent three
Envoys to the French Republic in order to
lerminateour differences with that Nation; â 
but the Directory havenot chosen to treat with
these three Covnmillioners, buthaveinfulting
ly feletted one from amoii'ft them, with
whom they fay they are ready to treat, but c
upon the terms offered to all the three. If t
this one Envoy should be sent off, or impri- t
foned, therefore before the frefh inftruftions t
which the gentleman from New York wishes
to be sent off should be received, it would be
prefer that the Directory (hould make choice -
offome other person with whom they will
be willing to treat. Having, however, (hewn
his pointed dislike of the proposition before
the house, by the present motion, he would
withdraw it.
Mr. Livingston said, he would not have
troubled the house with any farther observa
tions on this motion, if Â»ot forced to do it by
certain expreflions which had been used re
fpeiting it. One gentleman has called it ar.
infamous resolution ; another had said that the
motion which had been made and withdrawn,
was too mild a censure upon it ; another gen
tleman looked upon it with abhorrence. If
this resolution is so extremely abhorrent, he
(hould have been glad it gentlemen would
have condefÂ«en<Kd to have (hewn wherein its
abhorrence lies. What is this resolution. Doe;,
it tend to dishonour this country, by propo
sing to agree with any degrading terms offered
by the Direttory ! No such thing, What is it,
but to request the President of the United
States to in(truÂ£t the Envoy, whom he himfelf
appointed, to make such a treaty with France ,
as (hall be confident with our honour and in
terest > Yet this resolution is called infamous. 1
If this term was applicable to his motion, he
was ignorant of the meaning of words.
T[ic SfBAKE* said, as rhp from
t Connecticut, who midc afc of this<xpreffion,
hats been called to order, any remarks upon
, it u ere cijwally out of order. ,
Mjr. L. said he would make no comments
3 upon it, but confine his remarks to the relolu
, tons itfelf, It was his delirc, if pollible, to
j prevent a war with France, which mull in
volve this country in great distressâwhich
may, perhaps, deilroy it, all for the fake of a
punctilio. IJe was not ashamed of this opini
on any where. It would be for the interest,
for the dignity of this country, to conclude
an honourable peace with France ; more so
than any War which we could pofiibly wage.
The fate of War mult be doubtful âthe ho
nour of it extremely so. For his part, he fa w
f none that could be derived from war. He
0 wished to avoid it, if it could be avoided
, with honour. He was far from proposing to
preserve Peace jit the expenceot our honour.
- All he wished Envoy at present
f in Paris should, jf poflible, make a treaty
Â® founded upon theinftrudtions originally given.
\ Is there, exclaimed he, any thing so extreme
r ly bad in this ? On the contrary, he knew it
1 was thi wirti of a majority of the people of
. this country that a treaty should, if poflible,
\ be nude, and by that means prevent the ne-
ceflity of a war.
Bur it should seem as if gentlemen were ready to
fay, that it is better to go to war, tha : that one of
our Envoy? should make a treity for us, a* if they
Â» were ready to draw the sword, because three fcals
cannot be put to a treaty, i iftead of one. He was
[ not for doing this, nor were his constituents : nor
did he believe that either &e tr they should ever be
ashamed of this resolution. It would alway.* be a
' consolation to hirn that he had endeavoured to pre
serve the peace of the country, so long as it could
conftflently be done.
| It was altogether a misrepresentation, Mr L. I
said, to insinuate that the pe ion whom he wished j
to be inftru<fted to treat, was appointed by the Di- '
re&ory; he was chosen by the President of the U. j
States, and commifiioned by him with fuparate
; powers. And yet this man, thus appointed, is fpok- !
en of as a man chosen by the Executive Dire&ory of
France! He wished gentlemen to reconcile his to
themselves ; he could not do it.
Mr. Matthews thought this resolution ought
to be explained, before gentlemen were called to
vote upon it. He therefore moved the following a
mendment ? " Wbe eas this House has tofi all confidence
in tffe President of the United Stahs, and his deftre of
plunging this country in all the horrors of War with our
goodfriends, isfo evident, therefore ref.lved, life.

WHETHER weconfider the Eye, with refpeÂ£|

economy, or the pleasure and advanteges of vision,
we cannot but look upon it as one of the most ad
mirable and important organs of the human frame.
\\ hen we refleft, likeuife, on the many painful and
dangerous dlfeafea it is liable to, anting as well from
its necdlary use, as from accidental caufesj are we

a clearconception of the doÂ£lrine of vision, t

He, therefore, takes the libe>ty of informing the
public, that he intends to tarry here a (hort time,
and will undertake the cure all difcafes of the Eyes
(if curable) on apolication being made to him at

THE ,
ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE
Was celebrated in this City, yesterday,
with an universal glow of patriotism,
warm from the heart of every real A
merican.
1 he Prefidcnt received the congratu
lations of the members of both houses
of Congress, the Heads of Departments,
Militia Officers, the Cincinnati, Clergy,
and other r citizens.
The military aflembled on the occa
sion, consisted of some small detach
ments of a few of the militia companies,
infantry and artillery, and of the whole
body' of the new raised volunteer corps
in full uniformâThefe, with the seve
ral troops of horse, formed a most bril
liant military procession.
From the center ftjuare the whole
1 marched down High-street and pailed in
review of the President of the United i
States, the officers paying the proper
m:rching salute. The President appear- :
ed greatly delighted with the exhibition,!
for it is* butjuft to fay that a finer body ;
of men than the volunteer corps, and
the cavalry of this city do not exist on
the continent.
At noon a federal salute was fired by
captain Guy's Artillery. The Bells of
Christ Church were rung at intervals
thro' the day.
The countenances of the citizens, im
mense crouds of whom Tvere aflembled,
indicated that their feelings were peculiarly
Sntereftjd ia '-he celebration of the natal
day of their country.
The Philadelphia Volunteer Compa
ny of Grenadiers under the command of
major Thomas L. Moore, yesterday made
â  its firft public appearance. After partak
ing a (hare in the duties of the parade,
the corps marched out to Buih-Hill,
j where, at the close of a frugal repast, the
following toasts were drank : *
r. The Day : May i's lustre never be
obfeured by raids from France, or itsmufic
be jarred by the crowing of the Gallic Cock.
2. The United States : May the fliadow
' of ihcr Eagle's wings cover her herees in
the heat of batt.'e, and her talons rend their
enfmies in pieces.
3. " The Chief who now comman-'a
May his wisdom and firmnefs, under Pro
vidence, prove the rock of our defence.
[Drank (landing, with $ cheers ]
4. Gecrgt Walhington: the Saviour of 1
his country [Nine cheers.] !
J. The Government: Integrity its ftitld \
an I Truth its m u tt.>->-May it long mock [
the forms 0 f faftion, and the fierce afTaults <
of-foreign violence."'
| 6. The American Fair : May the leap I
of.tpn thousand swords from their scabbards, '
to protett them, prove that the Jpirit of
chivalry is not gene. [Three cheers.]
7. Jacj bins. Confufion and infamy to r
the Jacobins, and repentance to their dupes 1
of Europe and America. \
8. l'he OppoCtien : May the man who '
dares to stop the machine of government, '
be crurtied utyjer its wheels. J
9. The decp-ton'd thunder of the Ameri- e
can navy : May it soon strike terror into
cur country's foes. c
â Jo The army of the United States. c
11. Pinckney a>:d Marshall : Their voice If 1
was that of United America.
12. Macpherfon's Blues, and the other *
volunteer corps : Unanimity our motto, and
Independence'our aim. t
13. May the foil of cur country become n
poifoneus to traitors, and cease to nourifii u
men animated by foreign predile&ions.
14. Our National Honor: Let it bs L
lmprcfled upon the minds of the people that |
on it depends our independence and prof- j
perity. , i(
15. Seventy-fix and Ninety-eight, two 'â¢
rival acras jn the age of glory. 2 '
A deputation from Capt. Morrell's Vo
, lunteer Greens who alio dined at Bush-
Hill, here entered the room, with the com
pliments and good wishes of their company,
âwhich w-re most cordially reciprocated, vi
The compliment was afterwards retunsed'by ''â

" M>/ rtfidcnct in Paris, during the last win
> ter,hÂ»s enabled me to btcome acquainted with
? man 7 fifis ef a general as well as particular na
j ture, of which it may perhaps, be difficulr to
convince the people of th s country, but which
ought to be generally known.-âAn unwilling
ness to volunteer, upon oci afions of this kind,
. ' ,a ' hitherto prevented me from giving them to
the puhiic.
f It appears to me all-enential that the people
. of this country fliould underftar.3 the charaAer
and conrfufl of the pretended Americans who .
in France, and who have been principally
, inftrumentaJ in producing and inflidling the in- 1
jnnej against which we rife. These people '
1 (With a few exceptions of honorable and patri- 1
: otic men) are the fugitives of America and the j
dregs and outlaws of Europe. 1 need not ob
ierve that they and their connexions here have [
been the most adlive defpoilerscf our commerce t
the most inveterate calumniators of .iircdun- i
try and our governmentânor that they have
continually contradicted and embirrafftd all our <
public raiflioniries except Mr. Monroe. Dur- '
ing the last winter tl.eyhave made the most in- '
nefatigable eT.rts to divide our Comminioi/ers ; 7
they have every where and inceflantly repeated '
that general Pinckney was a known aristocrat; i
that general Marlhall had been burnt in effiey ,
for his attachment to the Britirti ; 3n d that Mr.
Gerry was <! Ibe Republican" who had brtn feflt (
to be over-ruled by :lie other two. When at <
length it was intimatrd that the de- r
manded a tribute of fifty million.-, they ih'flant- 1
ly advocated the payment of it fooaanimoufly, 'â 
thct I cannot even make the exception of some '
characters otherwise estimable a*d patriotic.â t
Tliey proved by calculation, that the price of a
peace would be less than the exj-ence of. war ; a
and I have heard some add, in a tone of exulta- *
' n ,oÃ ', if we refu ' Vd [llc payment now, we "
lhÂ»ii!d be broÂ«ght to it finally. E
The afperlions of th-fe people have extended f
not only to the government, i.ut to whatever is "
most refpeflable Â»mong us. The vulgarity as Â°
well as virulence of this abuse may be judged of u
trom a speech which I Veard our Consul general ii
make use of in company when speaking of the
chaia<oer of the lirlt of patriots and of ;// Â£ n
" General WaJhUgtin?' laid he â¢' is theprouj
ejt man I ever saw, except one negro."
We have other conl'ular characters in Francs
of a similar call one of tliem has remained in
office many months since judicial proofs were
known of his covering French property by per
jury and talfe consular certificates I know not r
whether it be true that *.!r. Monroe nude a re
port in favor of this man.
< The condufl of Thomas Paiae defcrves'par- 13
ticular notice. He lives ill the house of a jouiy 21
nahft of note, who is usually the firft to publish
whatever appears host le to our country. It was c<
in the paper of this journalilt that the Prefi- .â 
dent's last speech to Congress appeared, but
wholly mutilated, and altered in filch a manner, ar
by additions and omifiioni, as to excite the in-
dignation of the French and their governmentâ th
(Jit jciirnalifl complained that he could not infrrt
ihe entire speechâ yet he found room to insert
21 length, ,n French and Eriglifh, a vapid mix- ,u
tÂ»re of prose and verse, written by Mr. Edward r

To correct misrepresentation is imucffihle, Cnce
the prels is under -the ablolute control of [he
gorernment, and a journal that happens to con- of
tain any thint which they think exceptionable,
is mftantly filtneed. One was lupprefted for f
predicting in fubltance what has Gnce happened C
to Swit/erlind.
Were I to purfuethe fubjeCl of French liber
ty through all its details, the pursuit would lead
me too tar. Ido not helitate however to fay,
that the g ivernment is, both in appearance .ind 1 ths
effefl, wholty military, and probably the most ; r oi
despotic that ever existed. The military are ' f cr
drawn out in force upon the most trifl-ng occa- ' .
lions ; and 'he people are very where aecuflom- J
ed to pass under drawn swords and files of bay- COl
onets. The conduit of the eleClions however ; f P<
will bell explain the nature of the liberty there Dt
enjoyed.
In the firft place the councils have been occuÂ» doi

PROPERTY at the Seneca-Falls, in the county of
Ondndago, and flats of New-York, on the Hanks

This eftabliftment consists of an excellent grift
mill, saw mill, dwelling house, barn, and a port
age or carrying place, with 1 etwecn thirty and
forty acres of land, under good improve nent, and
as much more in the vicinity, as may be required
tor future improvement.
The grift mill is a handsome, new and well fin]
iftied building, of 50 by 30 feet, 3 (lories high,
and furniflied with a run of excellent Burr stones,
and another of Efopus' ftoncs, ot the bell quality
âand themoft approved boults, &c calculated to
make all the different qualities of flour for expor
tation or for home consumption : It is acccffible bj
water from every part of the Cayuga lake an J Se
neca-river, as well as from the Seneca-lakeâand
from its situation a verycxtenfive and
encreafing cuftbm : The stream on which it flands,
being the outlet of the Seneca-lake, the mill cau
never be in want of water ; and as it has been kept
working during the fev.reft season of the lalt win
ter, it is not liable to be impeded by froft :
The saw mill is also new, fituateil pn the fame

The portage is 3-4thsof a mils in length, along ,
the Seneca-falls âover which were parted in the I
last year, nearly two hundred boats with their
contents ; this objetfl is already produ-ftive of a,
handsome income, which niuft be increasing an 4
permanent:
Among the many advantages of
must be numbered the fertility of
countryâbeing the btft improved part of the coun
ty of Onondagaâthe concentration of inter-*,
course by land and water, the Geneffoe ftateroa<i
palling through it, as well as all water carnage to
Geneva, and the counties of Ontario and Stephen 1
which renders it a most eligible ft and for a Store or
TavernâThe river and lakes abouud ia fifh and

Besides the mills already ere<sted at this place, it
is calculated for any additional water works that
maybe found nccefTaryâFulling mill, baik milj,
