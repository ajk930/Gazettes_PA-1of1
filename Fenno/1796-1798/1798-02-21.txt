of Land, one half of which is under wood, the other
very fine arable Land, producing the bell Hay and

FELLOW-CITIZENS !
The hour of danger i comeâa falfe fe
eurily deceives and destroys youâour coun
try is ftrugjling in the deadly gripe of dis
order and rapine, and the eonteft iÂ« doubt
ful. Our government and laws tÂ»tter under
the unremitting exertions ofrnfiians panting I
for tumult, plunder and bloodflied, who
strain every muscle and torture every means
to tumble them into the dull. As they
prjf* you in the streets they eye you as the
future devoted viAims Â«f their fury ; and,
in hellish anticipation, view your property
at already their own. Reuse then, fellow
citizens, the robber is at your door ; the
naan of blood prowls round your dwelling ;
{hake of ihat indolence which in an hour
like this, is treason. Arouft from that fu
pinenefs which may be the forerunner of
death. Your ceun:ry demands your aid a
gainst a determined, incorrigible fadlion,
driven on by foreign intrigue, and the grasp
ing hopes of plunder, to overturn your go
vernment erected by the hands of wisdom
and pattjotifm, on the bones of depaited,
flaujjhtrred heroes, aod cemented with their
blood. Give not up the noble, the sacred
fabric without a struggle to preserve it,
nor shrink like cowards in the moment of
difficulty and danger. Your independence
was not thus atchieved, and deserves a bet-
C support. Can you doubt the views or
th= principles of these people, when with
violence, with clubhand with swords, they
hunt the friends of government from place
to place, break up their meetings even at
tbe expence of blood, and deny you even
the right of communicating your fer.ti
ments to tacli other ; when the rm'ns of
your country and government {hall rattle a
bout your ears ; when you (hall be thrown
i* the dust at the feet of a thoafand Robif
pierres ; when unbridled lull and rapinefhall
burst into your houses, and wrest youi wives
and property from your impotent gripe ;
when Our land (hall become a second def
lated France, swimming in its belt blood,
then, too late, will you curse the indo
lence and falfe security that btfrayed you ;
and your children too", ftiall curse you when
they begin to feel the wretchcdnefs and mis
erv to which )-(,u have most basely reduced
them. Priendi of government ! Power and
ftiength are your own ; these hell hounds
cannot stand before you ; you can never
fall but by your own inactivity. Come
forward then, as one man, bending every
thought, every hope, every exertion to one
great ofcjcit ; imitate your enemies in their
aÂ£tivity, perseverance and unanimity, and
you are yet fafe.
FORESIGHT.
For the Gaze 111 as the United Statu.
MK FiNNO,
Some persons have been under a great
roiftake as to the manner in which the com
mittee who decided upon the eleftion of Is
rael Israel were chosen. They suppose they
"were appointed by the Speaker or the Se
nate, as in commen cases; now the fait is,
tbe names of all the Senators were written
on separate pieces of paper and folded up as
nearly alike as pofiible and after being shak
en in a box were diftributedby lot into three
boxes; then a name was drawn alternately
out of each box, and each party had liber
jy to objeft until only seven names vycre left;
this was doneâThe committee were then
{Worn "to try the rtmtter of the petition
complaining of thÂ£ undue eleftion and re
turn anda truejudgmenttogive according so
the evidence." A patient hearing was giv
en to the parties and in the course of the in
ve&igaticm, when the counsel for the petiti
oners against Mr. Israel brought forward
teflimosy to prove that many of the voters
hsd eonfefied that they had not complied
with the neceflary forms to become citizens ;
the committee rejeftcd the evidence, though
the counsel 'declared that foch a decision
would in fa& be at once deciding again ft
them, as they would never be able to get
the voters themselves. This, however, had
Â»o weight with the committee, they decid
ed as they theught right in favor of tbe
counsel for the fitting member. Did this
look like being swayed by party? far from
it. The counsel for the petitioners after
wards established the point by the evidence
â¢f the voters themselves, the committee
were therefore bound to give the judgment
they have done. They were on oathâand
who is to be believed ? impartial men under
the foleron obligation of an oath, Â»r the
brawlers of party in a tavern under tbe influ
ence of party prejudice and the phrenzy of
an overheated imagination, inflamed and in
flaming for tbe purposes of electioneering.
Bluih ye, who have signed tefolutions re
fle&ing on the committee, and publilhed
them to the world, though yon know no
thing of the merits of the cafe.
An instance of the mtdtjiy of the party
way be seen in their calling on the member j
of the committee (and particularly on Mr.
Whelen) to resign their feats in the Senate
under the pretence that as Mr. Israel's feat
had been vacated, theirs mud of course. be
equally so.
People l.'ke these, who have â Â» regard
Tor truth lead themselves into difficoltie* by
bold aftertions without foundation. Col.
M'Clellan, who wÂ» chosen at la ft ele&iou,
hsd between seventeen hundred, and- two
tboufand votes more than tfie nest highest
ib vote: were there so many persons permitt
ed to vote who had no right ? Mr. Whelen
had a large majorityâl believe near one
thousand, and yet he is c;.Ued hpon by name
to rcfign his feat after having held it about
three years.
At the time Mr. W\>elen was elected, e
very pcrfon who had resided lis re two years,
could immediately become a citizen on mak
ing proof thereof and that he was a pcrfon
of good chart Aer: that Wa* not the Â«*fe at
last eleAion. No person who arrived in this
country fiace the 29th January 1795 can be
naturalized until after five year* residence ;
hence a greater ucceffity for enqniring, a
greeably to law whether the person offering
to vote was a Citizen or not.
Twenty days after the time of making -
the return i* allowed by law for the citizens
to objeA to the validity of the retnrn. If
no objeAion is made in that time, it can be
of ao force afterwards ; years have elapsed,
and now for the firft time an objeAion is
heard of. A FREEMAN.
. 11
To' the people of the city and county of Phi
ladelphia, and of the county of Delaware.
In various publications inthe news-papers,
and by faggqftions at public meetings, the
strongest efforts-have been made to persuade
you, that the committee of the Senate who
decided that Mr. Israel's eleAion was ille
gal, have not only violated yous-rights, but
have treated them witlj. derision aad con
tempt. It is of some importance to the
feelings of the committee, but of much
greater importance to your interests, that
you (hotild duly appreciate this tranfaAion,
To enable you to do this with greater facil
ity, I (hall submit to you the following faAs
and observations.
When the committee was formed, nine
teen members of the Senate were present,
exclusive of the Speaker who is always ex
empted from serving on committees. From
this number of nineteen, each of the parties
(which coufifted of Mr. Israel and one of
the petitioners against the eleAion) were
permitted agreeably to law to llrike out fix.
Twelve member* feeing thus excluded, the
number remaining was reduced to seven,
who composed the committee to try the e
leAion.
It is obvious that this mode of forming
the committee, gaveto both parties the pow
er of excluding therefrom those members of
the Senate, whose principles, politics or
temper were mod disliked, or distrusted by
them. Of consequence if out of all the,
members present, seven candid and imparti-,
al men could be feleAed, fhey would be
found in this committee.
To suppose then that tht committee did
not consist ef men of virtuous charaAers,
would be to suppose that the Senate in gen
eral (chosen as it is by the colleAive voice
of the people of Pennsylvania) iÂ» a fink of
corruption. Such a supposition would be
indeed reproachful to the Senate, but nolef*
so to the people of this state who elected
them. It would be to suppose that the peo
ple had ignorantly deserted, or basely be
trayed their dearest rights, by appointing a
colleAion of foels or knaves to admiflifter
one half of the Legislative- power of the
commonwealth.
The committee having been thi* fail Iy
formed'were solemnly sworn, to give a true
judgment on the tleAion, according to the
evidence. In addittion to their other
Legislative duties, they then proceeded to
fit from day to day on the tryal from the e
leventh of Deeember to the seventh of Fe
bruary, during this long and tedious investi
gation they patiently liltened to the elabo
rate and frequently Gonttntieus arguments
of the counsel on each fide ; examined all
the authorities and documents exhibited to
ibem ; and carefully attended to the -evi
dence brought forward by either party.
Judge then my fellow citizens how inconflf
tent it is with decency, justice and your in
terests, that a committee so constituted,
(hould after the conclusion of their painful
labours be loaded with reproach, unsubstan
tiated by proof or evidence: with reproach
that carries with it the charge of perjury,
and of a dercliAion of the mod sacred du
ties which they owe to you as their constit
uent*, and to themselves as men. Judge
whether it can be expeAed that committees
of this kind will alwayt dare to discharge
these important duties with firmnef*, if in
| consequence of so doing they are to be held
up as marks for the (hafts of party rage and
malice. r
If individuals who (hould feel disappoint
ed by the decision of a jury (hould endea
vour to hold them up to reproach and infa
my, would you not exclaim against the in
juftiee and danger of such an outraged
Would you not apprehend thatfuch proceed
ings if allowed to prevail, would induce men
attached to their peace and security, to re
fufe to perform these neeefiary funAions ;
or when performing them, frequently to be
terrified into decisions in favor of those par
tie* from whose fury they should have most
to apprehend? If this would be your decisi
on in cases where the interests only of indi
viduals are concerned are you not still more
obligated a* well as interested to proteA
those men who are your own
and on the faithful performance of whose
duties yonr most valuableright* must depend.
Let us then meet these pernicious and disin
genuous efforts with a just indignation and
thus endeavour to prevent the future annals
of our county from being Raised by a repe
tition of similar outrages.

For the Gazette of the United States. V
THE DIGNITY OF GOVERNMENTâNo.I It
Gtodfaith is the ("â¢ni of a free government ;
it itahov* all thingteffcntial to iti dignity and
uratioa : It ronmandi the esteem and the eon-
S.let.ee ef citizem, and foreign nationi ; it is
the magnet which attraftt all mindi and ope
rate* in every direction Its incAic.able worth
Â« attefied by all history, and by every wile
ftatrfman.
A government that vialates its own la wt,
tra&s, or ptomifei, sett the inalt dangerous and
corrupting exrrople to the people :o disregard
â¢ill principle, to defrjud the government of its
revenue, and to break all tbe sacred tit* which
unite and tnoralize a nation. History presents
a d eadful catalogue, and long as it is black, of
faithleft government!, Â«nd the mit"erie> and des
potism that followed their perfidy. Had Rome
and Carthage, ficredly adhered to the'pure max
i'ns of gooH faith tÂ« *ll people, there is evfry
reason to helieve they miâ¢ht have continued
free ani happy republic! to tht* hour. Out
they ronfu'ted rtie interest of tic day arid led
by their piffions, always healed I>y parties, ihev
fell a facrifire to tl.eir fully auil their vices-
Such bus been the sale of the ancient and fecms
too likely to kt of tlie modern republics.
From this feuree, a doubtful or a bad charact
er for Rational faith, cajne wars, internal convul
tions, a discord between the people awl the go
vernment ; a general relaxation of all principle,
confufion follows, .in; l finally a fulltn del'p t'fm
fuccacds ; and thus the door cf hope is (hut a
gamft liberty.
The unvarying law of gravitation, is not more
eflential to the order and duration of the material
system, than a put e ckaruHir is to the perpetui
ty and happintfs of a free government.
Let Americans often paÂ«fe in their career,
and mark well the cuufcs which led other na
t ten * into the " paths ofike ittJlHyer". It will
be found, by eoiiful'ing the" faithful page of hif
torv, that the mighty taufe <it tire univeifal.nil"
.traction of sice. government* in tv.ry country
from theTeHMWtyperiod to this $Uy has beer,
'the lsfs of tbarii&er.
â¢ â Let us now lock round arid mark well the
progrefe and'the pbihis of.Mfe Sate, in J the n a
tion.il-geveruTnefiii'.
The comtitotions aVe riot only the best in the
wc-rM. but are fii'fficur.tly'perfeal to pre-
Tirrve liber)y and public happinels,if they (hall
be well ndminidered. The great difficulties
always atile in the administration,. During the
formation of the lyftem, the mtereds aid the paf
fionsofpartiesarenot so mtichaffefled; but when
the adniiÂ»iflratÂ«rs commence their operations,
every interest and every passion is touched, apd
all the combudibles in human nature take fire.
Hence it is that no curb ever ytt formed by the
people could at all tidies keep their legislators
within the limit* of the constitution.
A large majority, (and often a small one) has
been able to fugged fuci plauGble exesfes (cal
led necessity for the public good,) for every devi
ation, that the people were not alarmed. One
deviation formed z precedent, the fee nd wasjuf
tified by the firft, ar.dby degrees the principles
of the conftimtion were annihilated. This faift
has beenacttded in every age and in every coun
try where republics have existed.
But who fears a Cafar th3t is dead, what na
tion lidens to the wisdom <Sf Solomon, or the
preaching of Paul, or to the voice of hiltory f
Do not generations fileccftivety walk over the
tombs o(their fathers forgetfulofthtM'own clef
tiny, arid tnoughtlefs of the long voyage of eter-i
nity ? Why then should we expefl men will
take warning from the bones cf ancient repub
lics, or the errors which led to their didslutiun !
The bed omen of future liberty, is a general
folic- so difi'ufe gospel morality, andjuft
ideas of government. A common error among
freemen is, ." that very little government is ne
the people never can with to injure
tbemfelves " Such talk as this is often heard
from seekers of popularity, and many good
people are deceived thereby. From this caufu
it is that there is iefs jealousy as che house of re
prefentitives, than of the i'enate, or the execu
tive. Our experience (iace the revolution con
firms this faÂ£t.
Had the fame (hides for power which we
have seen made by an house cf representatives,
been made by the I'enate, or the executive,would
not tbe alarm have been much greater ? This
(hows that the weak fides of our government
are the senate, and the executive These are
always the weaked branches in a republic, and
therefore require the aid of an enlightened peo
ple to fuppoi t Â»hem in the exercjfe ef their con
stitutional powers. Although it be neccflary to
watch every brar fh of government, it should
r.ot be with an evil eye to find faults, but with
an honed heart to guard with impartiality the
conditution j and to fugg.ft with candor the
abjections which reason seems to point out. In
performing this duty good and wife men will
never fuffer the evil spirit of pride or passion or
interest to guide their tongues or their pens.'
Natiens never would luvt been enflived, if
mens reason had been ftrÂ«ngerthantheirpa(sons.
Here lies all our danger f not the countless des
pots whieb cover the earth, nor all tbedemonÂ»
carnate and incarnate could edablilh an arbitra
ry government in America, if the rvason of
the people ftiould always re gn over their pas
sions. But nncontroulc'l paffiÂ»ns, not ehecked
by religious sentiment, are a spark from hell, and
their operations are infernalâthey burn out tbe
molality of the foul.
Uncivilized by the fear and 10-ve of God, mft>
will never be true republicansâthey will be go
verned by their paffipni, and therefore they will
be tyrants.
A deady eye on eternity, and a belief that
" God will bring every work into judgement
whether it hath been good or whether it hath
been evil," is theonly regulator of life : This is
the compass the good man steers by whether ru
ler or citizen, and he feels the weight of the
duty assigned him in every (ituation.
It should be deeply engraven on the hearts of
republicans, that virtue and liberty are heavenly
fillers, if they part they die. That it is infinite
ly more dangerous to violate the laws, ahufe
their rulers,or indulge iif any %iees, than in a
monarchy, as their government derives its whole
existence direilly from them, and pure morals
ar? the foul of it.
A free government must be s bono ; the le
gislature enafi the laws after profound delibera
tion ; the judiciary forever have the principles
of the conditution and tSe laws in slear view ;
and the executive power move on, armed by
both, like a deep river whose current ferencly
bears down all obdruAions. Thus the energy
of a well " balanced government," prote&s the
equal rights of freemen, and perpetuates liberty.
ACIREMA.
From the American Daily Advcrtifir.
Messrs. Clay pool*,- ; .
In your Saturday*! paper I noticed with
attention the Report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, arnk an> happy to learn that out
public accounts are brought so nearly to a
close that the precise debt may soon be as
certained. On feeiug.this report, the claira
of some eitizeni for payment of New Emif
fion Bills, occurred to me, aitd a query a-
Tofe in my mind whether the fubjeft ought
net to be immediately enquired into by Con
gress, for if the claim is supported by gov
gOTernmental engagement let it be paid, and
if not let the cafe befairly dated to the pub
lic, that the good faith of our government
may not be brought into question by these
claimants.
It seems to .be a of importance in
this view, although the sum is not great ;
and I hope we (hail not pay interest upon an
immense national debt, and at thrfame time
have our faith and ctedit caUed in ques
tion. I should not Meffi;. Printers have
written any thing on this fubje&, had I not
seen in Fenno's paper of la ft Thursday, the
report of Secretary Hamilton on the fame,
with some re'mark* thereon. Ido not pro
fefs to know the nature of these obligations,
but as the late Secretary, asserts with confi
dence " that the Uaited States are bound to
pay the.iatcieft on them 119 til the principal
ftnll be paid," it seems neceflary that this
affair should be fully investigated, and a de
cision had upon it. To put off claims upon
the public from year to year, without invef
tigstion, tends to involve them in greater
difficulties, it often injures honest creditors,
and alio injures the reputation of govern
ment, and besides, it sometimes enables de
signing men to support, or at lead to give
plausibility to unjust claims.

As we doubt not many of our readers are deti
rtus of knnwing what progress is made with
the Public Building! in the Federal City, we
lay before them the following report, lately
exhibited to Congress :
FEDERAL Ci*TY. !
Rtport of Jame9 Hoban, Superinsendant as
the Prcfident's Mouse, of the progress of
that building from the tÃth of May last,
to the 18th Nov. 1797.
The stone work has been carried up from
the window heads of the 3dftory, to the le
vel of the roof, including the architrave,
frieze and- cornice, and all the materials pre
pared and set. The stone cutters are now
employed at the balustrade which finifhes
the stone work of the building.
The brickwork has ften carried up from
the window heads, the inside and filling of
the outside walls, and all the party walls to
the full height of the building, and the
chimniesare raised as high as the roof.
The buildingis roofed and boarded, ready
to receive the ilate ; the boarding is covered
with a coat of composition to protest the
roof and inside work from the weather.
There is now laid on the gutters and plat
forms about 33,000 weight of lead, which,
with about 5,000 weight that is already
prepared, and yet to be laid, will complete
the gutters, platforms, and water carriages.
The doors of the two principal (lories are
all framed, and some of them are pannelled ;
the inside work is in great forivardaefs.

TUESDAY Fâ¬BRUART 20.
Mr. Hartley moved that the petition
which he yesterday presented from the mer
chants of this city, refpedting the ereftion
of new piers in the Delaware, he referred
to the secretary of the treasury, as he found
from enquiry, that this would be the pro
per reference in the firft instance. -
Mr. Dwight Foster made an unfavorable,
report on the petition of Guillaume Van
Ranfelaer, and others, which was concur
red in by the house.
On motion of Mr. T). Foster, the house
resolved itfelf into a committee of the
whole, on the report of the committee of
claims, on the expediency or inexpedi
ency of excepting certain claims from the
operation of ads of limitation ; and after
concurring in the unfavorable report of the
committee of claims, or the petition of
Johannes E. Lot, the committee rose (these
decifipns which had taken place having in
cluded the principles of all the referenced
made to this committee of the whole J and
had not leave to (it again.
Mr. Dawfon moved to refer the petition of
Edmund Brooke, which had been referred
to the above committee, should be referred
to the committee of .claims.âAgreed.
, Mr. J). Foster called for the second read- I
i(tg and decifloo on the unfavorable report
of the committee of claims, on the peti
: tionpf Joseph Gofs, which was according
' ly done, aud the house concurred in the re
port.
Mr. Venable, from the committee of
privileges, reported the opinion of the
said committee, that the resolution referred
to them, proposing the expulsion of Roger
Grifwold and Matthew Lyon, ought not
to be agreed to. The evidence, which was
tak' n befipre them was also reported, but
not read.
On a motion to read the report a second
time being made,
Mr. Venable said that one of the feleft
committee (Mr. Rutledge, who was to-day
indisposed) had requested that the buGnrfs
might not be taken up to-day, but that it
might be deferred till to-morrow.
Mr. Sitgreaves fuggelled the propriety
of printing the evidence in the mean time,
which would prevent any delay in the busi
ness.
Mr. Kittera thought thiÂ« unn#ceffary, at
the fact to be afcertaiiied had been done in
the face of fcÂ» great a part of the house, it
would be an unnecessary exprnce to print
the evidence.
Mr. Sitgreavfs said, aÂ» it had been tho't
necessary to take the evidence, it woultffure
ly be proper that every membel (hould have
it before him;
Mr. M'Dowell allowed that the disorder
which this evidence went to substantiate was
pretty well known in the house ; yet he
hoped the papers wonld be pristed.
Mr. Harper said, though many members
were unfortunately present whfn the affair
happened to which the evidence referred {
many however were not in the house, and
those would wilh to fee the evidence ; he
himfelf was not present, abd wiftfed to feÂ«
it. He hoped therefore it would be prin
ted.
The motion for printing was put and car
tied.
Mr. Harper then moved to postpone the
unfinifhed bufincfs relative to foreign inter
coitrfe until Monday nex|t, as he wiftitd it
to be deferred until the report of the com
mittee of privileges was decided upon.
Mr. Gordon would agree to the postpone
ment, if the gentleman from S. Carolina
would alter his motion to Thursday, in (lead
of Monday.
Mr. Harper consented, and the post
ponement wos agreed to.
On motion of Mr. Harper, the house
then refo'lved itfelf into a committee of th*
whole on the bill for altering the manijer of
entering stills, and after some debate on_ the
fubjeft, the committee rose aad had leave to
fit again.
A tneffage was received from the Presi
dent of the United States, with an account
of the expenditure of certain sums appro
priated on the 3d of March lad, for prose
cuting claims against the Belligerent nations
which have spoliated upon our c6rtrmtrCi?. J â
Ordered to bs printed.
The house then went into a Committee Â«f
the whole, on the bill providing for the*fup
port of the widows and orphans of certain
deceased officers, and having agreed to it
without amendment, the committee rose
and reported accordingly. The bill was
then ordered to be engrossed for a third rea
ding to-morrow.
The house took tip the report of the
committee of the whole on the bill for the

which, with the dispersion of many of the
good citizens, who were prevented from

Friends and Fellow Citizens,
To-morrow will be an important dayâit
will decide a question of great magnitude to
united Americaâthis question is no other
than whether we are a divided people ? It
is not disputed but that there is a difference
of sentiment among us upon of a po
litical nature, such difference will always ex
ist in every free country ; but if there is a
decided majority, that majarity constitutes
the people, for the minority in a tepublic
must always submit to the public will ex
prefled by the greater number of vcicet and
where it is not submitted to, anarchy must
take place. The friends of the two candi
dates have joined an,iffue to be tried by the
country. Those of Israel alfert that the
people, that is, a decided majority of the Elec
tors are in favor of the politics of Jefferfon,
Monroe, Randolph, and the other adherent!
of France who are ready to surrender our
independence to that nation and have fixed
on areprcfentative openly profefling the fame
political creed. The friends of Morgan de
ny this position and have fixed on a reprefeti
tative who with them profeffet that Ameri
ca is an independent people pofTefling the
right to govern themselves by laws of their
own making without the controul of any fo
reign nation, to make treaties and compose
differences with other slates without the in
terposition of foreign public ambafTadors or
secret emissaries. The. eledtort of the city
and counties of Philadelphia and Delaware
are to give a verdift upon the important
question, and it is to be hoptd that every
person entitled to vote will put himfelf to
the trouble -of carrying his ballot to the
place of election within his diftriit, that the
truth may be once for all fully ascertained,
for I trust that this being done all real or
pretended republicans will quietly submit to
the eCent and that we (hall no more hear of
fatStion or party, or division among us.
I do not mean to infiuer.ee a single elector,
but to press upon every individual pofTefling
the right, to come forward and give his vote
for one or other of these two candidates, all
parties having agreed that the sum total on
both fides will give the true sentiments of
the people. Let no maij therefore excuse
himfelf with the light apology that he has
but one vote; for no man Jn the eommuni
ty has mijre than one, and if such excuse is
fufficient for one it is equally good for a hun
dred or a thousand others.
Let the aged, the infirm, the meek and
peaceable citizÂ«ns go early in the day, and
those who have flrength of body to bear the
inclemency of the season wait till thefirft have
given their votes, the business of the day
may be thus conducted with good order and
without th?t press which might beoccafion
cd by all crowding to the windows at the
fame time.âl am your
FELLOW CITIZEN.
7*o the Freemen of the city and eminty of Phi
ladelphia, and the county of Delaware.
FELLOW-CITIZENS,
A late decifidn of the senate having de
clared the e'edtion of Israel Israel as a mem
ber of their body to have been illegal, and
consequently void, you have another oppor
tunity offered vou of exercising one of the
molt valuable right* which freemen can pos
sess, and by the exercifeof it, at this time,
the world will determine, whether you are
genuine citir-ens cf the United States, and of
course the friends of good order and regular
government, Â«r whether you will be likely to
prefer' the yÂ»ke of foreign power to the
weight and care attendant upon felf-govern
ment. It does net at this time appear to
be a proper question, whether the private
character of Israel Israel can with any de
gieeof justice be put in competition with
that of his opponent : admitting them
both to be equally good, for argument fake,
a question of a far more important natuie
to the public will then occur, upon the de
cision of which every good citizen, every
confidence man, poflefTed of a mind inde
pendent enough to put out of the (jueltion
party views, or to --dived itfelf of all par
tiality, resulting from habits of intimacy,
and social intercourse, ought and neccflaii
ly will, aft upon this very important cmcr
! gene jr. T'ye question I allude to is, which
I of the two candidates is bed calculated to
represent with propriety in Icglflative con
cerns, the important interests of so refpetfta
ble a diftrifl, as that in which we reside ?â*â¢
And here I am bold to aflVrt, without tlie
lea ft apprehension of a deaial, that no com
parison can fairly be made between tlie two
individuals, who, at this time, are felt-died
as objefts "from which to make a choice.
The excellent and careful education of Ben
jamin R. Morgan, the opponent upon this
( occafioa of Mr. Israel, his early studies,
; his habits of intimacy with people of liter
ary charqdter, the great intercourse which
he has at all times with persons confpi
cuoas for their talents and information, may
all with propriety be considered, as precious*
requisites in the .formation of an ufeful pub
lic charadler.
Nothing of this can,-I believe, bt advanc
ed in favor of Mr. Israel, or if he has had
any of these he appears to
have profited very little by them, if we may
judge from his cooduA, firice he has been
known as a citizen of Philadelphia. He
never has appeared as a prominent charac
j ter amongst his fellow-citizens, except in
turbulent times, when he has been made use
of by others, more cunning and equally
mischievous with himfelf, as a ladder to their
; individual promotion. In such times, he
has ever been esteemed the favorer of anar
chy, thefvpporter of sedition : his feeble ef
j forts have been directed to the introdu&ion
of disorder into the slate, and no means
: have been neglefted, that promised success
in promoting the views of the party, with
which he adted. I wi(h not to keep out of
view his services during the prevalence of a
malignant fever in this cityâit entitled him
to the laud of humanity, and will be remem
bered to his honor, whilst a trace of that
dreadful scourge to the inhabitants of this
city remains. But the exertions of others,
who were fortunate enough to be removed
from tÂ£e icene of immediate danger, was
also praise worthy, though perhaps in alefs
degree. The Stuation of Mr. Israel as one
of the committee of distribution, entrusted
during the last summer with the handing out
the charitable fubferiptions in favor of the
distressed poor, has no doubt been the means
of procuring him many votes ; and wheth
er the individuals, who partook of the
charities of their more fortunate brethren,
always distinguished the fource.from which
the bounty flowed, may at least be question- j
ed. But waving any further inquiry !
into a line of condudt, which, if faithful- '
ly pursued at a religious duty, is no doubt j
highly recommendatory,and wouldhave due !
weight if urged as a qualification in a candi- 1
date for the appointment ps a manager of
the Hospital, or guardian ef the poor, but
could by no meant furnilh proofs of his fit
nefs for lcgiflative fundtions, upon what o
ther ground, can he reft his claimto the votes
of the thitiking part of the community ? Is
it his devotednefs to a partyi boldly laying
claim to exclujive patriotism? Certainly upon
this ground he is not entitled to fupportâ
for to Americans accustomed to judge of
men, more fromjheir adlions than their de_
clarations, this claim mull certainly be re
jedted ; for Men, who could applaud the
conduit of Genet, or any other foreign mi
niftcr, when insulting their country in the
person of their beloved chief magi/Irate, can
know little of that love of country, so es
sentially requisite in a Patriot. Such men
may lay claim to the wages of a foreign fac
tion, but are devoid of the principles which
form the character, ar.d, of course, unde-
Terving of the name of good citizens. Is
it his exertions to allay the uneasiness, which
existed in the western parts of this State,
with refpedt to a certain law of the United
State* in the year 1794, or his pious wilhes
for the fafe return to their wives and families
of that part of the community, who, justly
thinking, that the peace and dignity of their
country depended upon a steady support of
its laws, and a due performance of their se
veral duties as citizens, facrificed with alac
rity their domestic cemforts, and in lieu
thereof rifqued the dangers of a campaign,
and the inconveniences of a soldiers life,
which can entitle him to this mark of confi
dence from his fellow citizens? Certainly
not âfor his conduit and his exprefiioÃS at
that time juttified the attempts of. those,
1 who seemed piepartd had circumstances fa
vored them u to ride in the whirlwind and
diredt the storm."
In fliort the more the public charafter of
â  this man is analysed, the more unfit lam
I sensible, he will be decreed to occupy the
place, to which his ambitious views, and
: the baneful projedts of his party point, and
to the attainment of which every nerve will
be {trained, and every effort made. Upon
the friends, therefore, of their country
upcti the fopporters of a good and regular
government, founded upon the authority of
the people, and in contradiction to the male
- volence and misrepresentation of a certain .
' set of factious men, to whom all Jcinds of
' government, not exclusively vested iÂ» them
selves, it exceptionable, and in a word upon
all these who with ta be luffercd to lit down
and enjoy themfelvti under their own vines
> and their own tig ti*ees, without having any
' one to make them afraid,(it iÂ» peculiarly in
cumbent to exert themselves in support of
Benjamin R a Morgan, a man of tried prin
-1 ciplc and acknowledged ability.

" Consider with yourfelvcs, that there it

well-being depends up n its piefcrvation.
Since at a pinch one good man gains a vote,
and laves a country âAnd what does any-cotn
try know, but all inay depend upon their male
ing a good choice ? But then to fell the Provi
dence ef God, and the dear bought purrhafe erf
your ancefiors for a iittle money, is the mark of
a wretched mind. Trulyfuch ought not U. have
the power ef a freeman, that would In abuse his
own, and hazard other men's freedom \vf it i
He deserves to be cast over-board that would
fuffer the veflel to fink and thereby drown the
company embarked with him.
I would ktrow if any of you all, if in a differ
ence about a private property, an house or a
cow, or any other thing, you wou'd be eal'y, in,-
d fferent and careless in chufing your arbitra
tors ?,Certainly you would not: With what
reason then can you lie unconcerned in the qual
ification of men, upon Whose fitsefs and integ
rity depends all you and your posterity may
enjoy ?
The reprefentativea of a nation ought to con
fid of the most wife, sober and valiant of the
people; not men <f mean spirits, or fordid
paflisns, that would fell the interett of the
people that chufe them to advance their own >
Pray beware of these.
Have a care of ambitious men, who seek
honor* and preferments, for they intend them
selves and not ihe advantage of the country.
Chufe no indigent person ; for these may be
under a temptation ofabuling their trust, to
gaiit their own ends : For such do not prefer
you, whieh Ihould be the end of their shoice,
but to raise themfelvcs by you.
Chufe no prodigal or voluptuous persons ; for
hefides that they are not regu'ar enough to be
law makers, they are cojrmonly idle; and
thongh they may wish well to your intcreft, yet
they Will lose it rather than their pleal'uresâ
So that such perfens are only to be preferred
b-forr thdfe that are fiber to do mifebief: whose
debauchery is of the mind ; men of unjust and
liuifter principle. ; who the soberer, they be to
themselves, tie worse they aretoymi; rather
takes Itranger if r. commended by an unqucf

LETTER 111.
Essay in the form of a tableau, to appraise the im

land muted. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better furnilhed from France er
Englandâlt is principally on this fubjeft (which
would haveaftonifheda me'e throrift) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience These
kind of toUecncx, uulutkily as oiificult to obtain as
they are much to be defiled, aiethc only fuie guides
the ftaufman call take for th. policy of treaties de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei

slbief* ot colonel Swan's calculation ; and al.hough
the propkefies of L rd Sheffield have already been
coniradifted by expeiience, and by fevcrai able pens,
yet it io curious to lee the author of ihe prelent work,
dispute wiih him the only grourd on which he has
*Ol been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the requited condition, will be better able
than Gieat Britain to supply us with several articles,
which the English author allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's pailithty ajftel m (if he
has any) does not appear to have at any time created
a partimty of judgment. The result of this calculation
is that in 1789, that is to fsy, at a period when arts
and manufactures did sot present in France the vast
meani and probability of extension which they now
polTcfs. that even io 1789, it was presumable, that
Fiance would not only have the means to supply one
half of any given quantity of the produ&lons of France
and > nglsnd united, but also to enter into competition
with Gieat Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wildom of her government, and *)( indultry
of her inhabitanU.

Hen is by no meant fupeifluous . the principle of the
advantages which would result to France from the
importation of provision* snd raw mateiials, is every
where applied ; and it is upon this argument, that
the author eftablilhes his demands to the French go
