FRENCH INFLUENCEâNt. IV.
MR. aUSIStt, p
THE zealous supporters of the federal gdv
trmnent, warmed by * just sense of indigna
tion at the attempts made by France to (invert
& inake it I'ubfervtent to her own purpol'et, may
naturally expe&, that I shall charge the whole
body of opponents to government, admirers and
advocates of French principles, with hiving
been corrupted by French gold. No, my tel
low-citizeHS, I am not afluated by so illiberal,
intolerant a spirit. âThe sincere objeil of these
rjfays, however ufelef* ihey may prove in *!ie
event, is to allay the violence of par ty zeal, to f
remove from the great body of antitederaliits, a
that stigma wlich has been ir.difcHminately laid \
upon them â-to place upon the heads of t.ie c
guilty done the odium they jnilly merit to t
com ince theirtco credulous partisans that they
have h-ten deceived by fall'e and hollow pro
feffiont of patriotilm, and that if they rtjedl
the incendiary counsels of thofepretended patri- I
ots ( who as Mr. Fauchet fays have all of iliem 1
their prices) the rial friends tÂ®the people, to ,
liberty and law, will receive them with open j
arms, and will bury all palt differences in per
petual oblivion.
Mr, Genet, the incendiary minifler of France,
has been educated in the lchool of sedition and
jteofeinifm.â He knew full well the weak fide
of the human heart. He had studied the exam
ample of the firft matters in the science ot in
ftruiflion, and had learned the secret of govern
ing the majority by the mjchiQitiers of an art
ful and an intriguing minority, lie lud leen,
t'lat by two powerful engines, the mightiell
monarchy in Europe h*d been battered to the
greÂ«nd. .
A venal and abandonedprtfs, devoted to le-"
dition, is alone fiifScient to involve in general
ruin, the faireft ftru<s\ures ârthe mull collly edi
fices of law and government. But combina
tions of men. for the purpose of watching the
nieafures, and of "J lopping the wheels' of a
government, whatever they may stile therofelvet,
whether denominated"conflitutioual societies, '
Â«' jacobin alVeciations," or by by the more mo
dern and elegant name of affiliated clubs,
are Hill more masterly inventions in the cause
of terrorism and anarchy. I am individually
convinced that no form of gtjveipment, no ci
vil focitsy, can long under any circumstances,
withftaiid tjhe combined force of
powerful enemies. # â¢
Geset, frefh from a country in which these
terrible inftiumcr.ts of despotism were, madly
triumphant, heated, boiling over witn that fa
natic p'arenzy, that savage, that fierce dtmentia
which was epidemic in the sanguinary reign
ef Sabtfpitrre, furnamed the humane, made his
firft debarkation, at Charlcfton, South-Carolina
âa spot of all others oft the continent, the belt
fitted to promote the pacific objeils of his milT
ion. That kit landiug at this place was a part
of that nefarious confpiracytoihrow this coun
try into the war, or to separate the affeflions of'
tiie people from the government, cannot at this
period be denied, fince'ithas been h often re
jected in the public prints, and no pretext, no
jpology either ufcicia! or private has ever been
offered for this daring and outrageous insult up
en the dignity of our country. The incendia
rf mimlfcr began his careeer by granting com
n.ilEons for privateers to any who app:ied for
them-, by enco .raging the spirit of rapacity
and plunder ; by authorizing and procuring
thesnliftment of foldicrj within our territories;
by ifilling commissions and employing Ameri
can citizent to begin a military enterprize with
in our jurifdiflion ; by receiving repealed ad
drei ts publicly at mioifter of France before he
produced his credentials or had received his ex
tquatoi ; by flattering thepafiiens and he vl
#t v of < ur citizens, and by perfuadiiig them to
eoiilider the eaufe of France as their ewn in his
own fulfomc answers tot ieir addresses ; by pro
felling a regard ai.d an affeflion for this coun
try and its citizens which the event hat proved
to be falfe and deceitful ; by engaging on his
â¢fide (in what manner or by what means they
best can tell) the Editors of several newfpapert
in the moll populous towns in the United States;
encouraging the circulation of those profti
tuled vehicles of slander ; by excluding from
those papers (which have since been denomina
ted French) every fentimeot and every publica
tion which would have counteracted theicviewt
âand left any candid citizms lhould doubt the
truth Of this .-flertion, I publicly challenge any
writer to produce a single publication in Bache's
Aurora, Greenlcaf s Argus,or the lying Chro
nicle, in wnich tha federal government or the
Eritifc nation, if ned, have not been
aLufed and execrated, or in which the French
jrieafures, either in Europe, or with refpett to
ut, have not been approved and applauded.
Like a weathercock, or like the Vicar of Bray,
they have swivelled louad and veered about
with all the abfurditiet, contradi&ions and bar
barities of the French jacobins. Genet had
not enly engaged etitain papers to fuyport his
vije measures, but he had enlisted the ahleft wri
tert, whose"" confidences had their prices."
In whit manner this hat been done, whether by
gold or flattery, it of little moment to the pub
lit who have fuflertd. Mr. Secretary Dalits a
Britilh emigrant, can no doubt resolve this point,
if properly fee'd. He can inform the public of
what nature bis reward was far quibbling in di;-
ftnee of hit patron Gene* when charged with his
traitereus appeal from the cenftituted authori
ties ; and if we give any credit t;> the memora
ble, and never to be forgotten letter of Mr. Ftu
ebet, Vr. Dallas could give us some light as to
the negotiation with the flour merchants, about
which some enviout clous still haflg and hover.
That Mr. Genet employed an engine still more
forcible to batter down the goodly Abric of
our conftitutiou ; that he had nearly-accomplilh
ed hit objeft of involving us in the war, if the
prudence of our executive had not snatched us
from the impending min, I will endiavorto es
tablish in my next. LEONID AS
BALTIMORE, May 22.
Aiout 5 o'clock yesterday afternoon, t*o
â¢ clouds paS'ed over this city, and befidet pour

discharged also much ele&iical matter. They
ar*feÂ» one in the northwest, the other in the

formidable appearance, until they-had arrived
over about the middle of the citv, when they
emitted two dreamt of the fluid, which suc
ceeded each other in the space of about three
minutes, with tremendous claps of thunder.
The firft one struck the chimney of Mr.

siderable injury. Fortunately, no one was

" If after all, any individual disapprove of c
the voice of his country, what does dtfty and
common modfily requite of him? lo be t
perfefUy confident he is in his opinion", v
and those entruftcd to decide are wrong 1 t
Who is the man entitled to so arrogant an i
cftimation of )ii3 own abilities i Is he ri-.fhiy
to determine that.the measure has been adopt- <
ed from some difhorieit motive ? W-hat right I
has one man to charge another with dilhoÂ«ef
ty without proof? Let him prove and punish 1
if he can. If he can do neithei, but will 1
throw out calumny at random, he mult (land
in the view of his fellow citizens as a slan
derer, and incur tile suspicion that his readi
ness to fufpeft others of dilhonorable inten
tentions, Ims probably arisen from something
in the texture of his own mind which led him
â  to ascribe worthlcfs motives as the most na
tural inducement of action. The part surely
" for every man who loves his country, but
who disapproves ef any public authoritative
j decision, is to submit to it with diffidence and
t refpeff, considering the many chances there
are that his own opinion may be really wrong,
- though ho cannot perceive it to be so; that
1 whether it may or not he does not live ix a
" defpatic goverhment where any one man's
I opinion, not even his own, is to decide for
j all others ; and that the very basis of all re
publican governments in is the
' fubmiflion of a minority tathe majority, where
- a majority are conflitutionally authorifcd to
' decide. For a man lo call himfelf a republi
e can without entertaining this sentiment, is
â  folly. *To be one, without afting upon it,
is impoflible.
0 "To you, gentlemen, are committed pro
secutions for offences agaitift the United
e States. The objeft is the preservation of a
y union, without which undoubtedly we should
BOt now be enjoying the rights of an inde-
pendent people, and without the support of
s which it Ts vain to think we can continue to
a enjoy them. This ceuntry has great energies
1 for defence, and by supporting each other
~- might defy the wot Id. But il we disunite,
1 if we fuffer differences of opinion to corrode
~ into enmity, jealousy to rankle into diitruft,
weak men to delude by their folly, abandoned
.. men to disturb the order of society by their
0 crimes, we must expeft nothing but a fate as
n ruinous at it would be difgraceful, that of
- inviting some foreign nation to foment and
l " take advantage of our internal discords, firfl
making us the dupe and the prey of an am
r bition we excited by our divisions, and to
g which those divisions, if continued, muffin
; evitably give success. So critieal and peeu
i- liar is our situation, that nothing can save us
1- -from this as well as every other external dan
ger, but constant vigilance to guard against
e even the most distant approaches of it, and be
ing at all times ready to provide adequate
0 means of defence.âOur government is so
is formed, that that vigilance can always be ex
)- crted, and those means when necessary be
1- drawn forth. To rely upon these is not only
, d our indispensable duty, but the only chance
!S of securing that union of spirit and exertion
J s without which in a moment of danger noef
l; forts can be of any avail. For 21 years that
i- union has pteferved us through multiplied
dangers, and more than once rescued us from
l * impending ruin. I trnft it will yet display
1 itfclf with its wonted efficacy, and that no
threats, no artifices, no devotion to names
iy without meaning, or profefSons without fin
'j cerity, will be capable of weakening, by any
0- impreflion on a sensible people, a cement cf
>e fential 10 their ex'iftence.
1, " I have troubled you with this address,
to gentlemen, on account of the extreme im
d. portance of the matter of it at the present
f' moment The sentiments have flowed warm
ut ly from my heart, and I flatter myfelf are
not uncongenial to your own. The present
situation of our country is such as to require
the exertion of all good men to support and
" save it. I enter into no particulars, as the
>y legislature of the United States are on tfce
b- point of meeting, and for whose decision every
* worthy citizen must wait with solicitude and
respect. In the mean time it is of the ut
e_ most consequence that every man lhould fa
ils credly obey the laws of the country aflually
ri- in being. They cannot be altered, nÂ«r the
a- observance of them in any instance dispensed
with, without the authority oj" the Congress
to of the United States, in any exigence, how
ever great, in any situation, however alarming.
re There it no occasion to doubt, but that the
of whole proceedings of that most refpeftable
h- body, will be condufted with a degree of
Â»e temper and firmnefs suited to
ul and trying situation which called them toge
ther, and that the great objeÂ£t of all their
deliberations will be, if poQible, to preserve
thepeace,at the fame time that they i%aintain
inviolably, the honor, the interest, and the in
dependence of their country."

to tliat part which contained cxprefiions ot re- *

ed the committee fliould havi refrained from 0
expressing an unqualified approbation or ail the
measures of the Kxecutivs. io omiUit woultl
not imply censure. liy introducing it, it forced
all those who entertain even doubts ot the pro-
nriety of any one Executive measure to vote a- : j
gainitthe address. ' ,
Thr principal causes of irritation on the part t
of l ? ianee insisted upon in the anlwsr were the
rejeitiou of our minilter and thefcnti.ncnts con*
tamed ill the speech iaf the President of the Di* i
reaory to ourlate minister. If gentlemen would ,
look into the Documents laid before the house j
by the President, he was confident they would j j
'find the true reason for the relufal to receive our ( t
minister. He came only its an ordinary miuif-i <
ter, without any power to propose such modi- j
ficatfons as might lead to an accommodation, ' <
and when the Directory discovered thisfrom his . 1
credentials they relufed him. In anlwerto this j <
it had been urged that M. De la Croix Minister | ]
of Foreign Affurs, from the firft well knew that i I
Mr. Pinckney was only the tucceflbr to Mr* j '
Monroe, and that his coming in that quality was
not the ftafon why the Trench refufed to receive \ '
him. Mr. Freeman referred to the documents ]
which had been laid before the house on this |
subjeCt, from which it appeared that thc*ySccrc- j
tary of M. De la Croix had iuggefted a reason
for -the apparent change of opinion on the iub
jeift of receiving Mr. Pinckney. Suppole, the
Secretary observed, that Mr. De la Croix had
, made a raiftake at firftrin the intentions of the
Diredlory, was that mistake to be binding on the
Directory ! . , n
Mr.Freeman put a cafe. Suppo.e aminider
came to this country, would he be considered
: as admitted to all the rights of a mimiter upon
delivering his credentials to the Secretary of
State ? He believed not.
, He proceeded to argue, that the rejection of
an ordinary minister was not a breach of the
law of nations and confequently'not a just eaufe
' of war. In support of this opinion he quoted
â¢ Vaitel, p. 669. He considered Mr. l'inckney
' in the light of an ordinary minister ;he was sent
1 to explain, cultivate harmony, &r. and without
. powers to fettle existing differences. Mr.Mon
! roe had resided for some years near the Repub
lic, and had difcufied and explained such points
' as gave umbrage, explanations were alio receiv
ed by the French from our government thro'
their own mmilttrs here ; but it appeared they
were not fatisfied with our explanations, and
they vilhedfor a minister from us that should
have fuflicient powers to adjust the matters in
dispute amicably.
lie did not wiih to be underltood to consider
the conduct of the French as perfectly jultifiable
âbut he could not conceive that it was l'uch
1 as to jultify on our part irritating or violent mea
-5 fures.
As to the speech of the President of the Di
, reCtory he could not fay much on it, he did
not perfectly understand it. As far as he did
he considered it a childish gasconade, not to be
c imitated and below resentment. He read part
" of it. It was certainly arrogant in him to fay
* that we owed our liberty to their exertiuns.â
I But if the French could derive any fatisfaCiion
f from such vain boasting he lud na objection to
a their enjoying it. There was another part ot
j the speech that had been considered as much
more obnoxious. It was said to breathe a design
c to separate the people here from their govera
" ment. The part alluded to was no more thafi
r an expreflion of ait'eCtion for the people, he could
n fee nothing in this irritating or intuiting ; it was
if a mode of expreflion which they used as to
thcmfelves and by which they wished to convey
their affe&ibn for the whole nation. The term
people, certainly ttieluded the government, and
couid not 'iith propriety therefore be said to se
parate the people from it.
It had been observed by a member from S.
e Carolina, that the French had no business to
1. know how far the poyvtrs of the minister ex-
J tended before they received him : that it would
give them a great-advantage in the negotiation
if they were acquainted with his inltruCtions.
e There would certainly be no proprietyor reason
e be observed, why they should be made acquaint
r ed with ivery particular in the inltruCtions, but
T it was certainly not improper that jhey should
n know before they received a minister, of what
e nature his million was, whether extraordinary
for the accommodation of differences or only
intended to maintain a friendly intercourse.
There was one circumstance mentionedin Mr.
e Pinckuey's letter which had a tendency to re
move the opinion that the rejection of Mr.
d Pidckney was intended as a mark of isdignity.
,t He dates in one of his letters, that the Directo
ry wilhed him gone, though they did not wish,
>s it appeared, to take the measure of ordering
him away, yet that they had about that time
sent off 13 foreign ministers. There might, he
e remarked, have been some reason of state that
1- induced the French governmenrat this time to
is fend away foreign ministers ;it was evident that
, r the measure was not pointed against this coun
try exclusively.
f The member from South Carolina (Mr. Smith)
had taken piins to colleCt in one view 4 number of
'â  expreflions to be found in one of the communica
g tions of the late French minister here, to rouse thÂ»
3, feelirgs of the House. The quotation had not
n been tairly marie. Moll of those offenfive expres
s fions-were used by (Mr. Adet hypothetically, and
"" the minilter concludes the fenteuce by exprefling
" his convi&ion that they never can apply to this go
o vernment. But even if this nation had been in
1. fulted by a foreign agent, it this tÂ® excite our in
c dignation against the country to which ha belongs ?
A governor of one of eur states had been grolsly
insulted by the agent of a particular nation here,
the iufu'it was 11.vcr proposed ts fce relented against
the nation that sent him.
It had been said, that the French h*d not com
plained of the British treaty 'rill more than a year
after its ratification. The appropriations to carry
- that treaty into effcCt, heobfcived, were not made
'till June, and the letter of the French minister
â was sent in November of the fame year. But there
are numerous documents to lhew'th u the complaints
of the French were from an early date unceasingly
aitdrcffed from their minister here to our govern
' ment ana from their government to our minister
in Paris.
It had been said that the French had n<s right to
'e complain of any fav-r granted to the British by the
|y treatj, as the French of course participated in the
right by virtue of their treaty Villa us. But tlje

t lj firnanefs, and that of childilh petulance or ridi
culous bombafi.
| . It had been observed, Mr. Freeman Jjid, by
s the member from South Carolina, that the
French were guilty of the firfl aggrtfiion as to
( > captures at sea. That their order to take our
provision veflels were dated in May '93, and
thofe of Britain were not issued tHI some time
j after. It would be recollected, however, hr
u said, that before the French iflued these orders,
the British had entered 011 their plan ufattcinp
r ting to starve France, and had used iur vefiels '
e unwarrantably for this purpose, by detaining in
h thair ports forns of our provision veflels bound
t . to France ; it would also be remembered, that
at this time, the convention between ftuffia and
â _ Spain was in exiflence, and that the olijed> of It
was, according to the declaration of Lrrd
j Grenville to Mr. Pinckney, to detail neutral
e veffelsbound to France with provifioiis. The
rt decree of the Frendi that had been Eluded to
was, he fiff-.her remarJied, expressly predicated
_ on the order of the liritifh for detaining in their
n ports provision velTels bound to Francti.
0 It was however, very immaterial to determine
j- what nation began these depredaticrs on our
commerce; it was the duty cÂ» the leaflatui-e to
n refill them from whatever quarter fliey misht
come, and to protect the property the Arm-'
rican citizens.

' e ' Mr. Grifwold said, if he underftooj the f.ate

Governments.
fly 1 ' le a PÂ°iÂ°gyi he said, was a new one, und
â n- one which the French had not thought of
ler making for themselves; for they tell us, as
t0 '' a PPÂ«rs from Mr. fetrern the
he Secretary of State, " thry will notacksow
he 'edge or teceiv: another Minister Plenipatet)Â«
h- tiary from ths Unhed States, upuj after tV>*redress of the grievance*Ucrra-vleiof the

fay (or rat her the ge'itleman from Virginia i
Jays in his amendment) they rejected our Mi- 1
niller, Â« -cause he hr.cl dot powjr'enou^h, â ]
therefoie for the apology now-mnle for the t
Fiench government they were indebted to t
the ingenuity of the mover. t
Now, said Mr. Giif\vol3, I do not wilh r
that the House of R.-prcfeutatives {hould 1
undertake to th.-ilce apologies for the conduct
of the French government towards this. It (
was tiue they needed apology ; but he did *
not think it was proper for us to make them, c
Further, as this "pologv was not made by c
t'lcmfelves, but wholly different from their j
awn aHertions it was not likely that they z
nould fall into it. They fay, " Permit us to I 1
eil our privateers in yunr ports* anhul trea- 1
ics and repeal laws, tnd then we will receive !
Mr. Pinckney, and then we will tell you on :
vliat terms we will make peace with you". <
\fter this declaration, he did not think it t
vould be proper to attempt any new spology <
â Â»r them. He therefore supposed, that so I
fr as this proposition offered a new apology ]
ir the French Republic, it could not meel i
ith the approbation of the committee.
Thu next proposition contained iii the t
amendments was, that the House of Repre- <
icntatives Ihould interfere with the Execu
tive Pover of this countiy, dittate to '
it what fort of steps Ihould be taken towards 1
reconciling the French Government. He I
asked whether this was consonant to the prin- ;
ciples of the Conditulion ? Whether the '
Constitution had not delegated the power of
making treaties to other branches of the gov- 1
crnment ? He believed it had, and that there
fore we had no right to tli&ate to the Exe- ]
eutive what fhoulij, or what fliould not be ]
done with refptft so present disputes with
the French Government : On this ground, 1
therefore, he considered it as 'improper. .
In the next place, the amendment contain- 1
ed another proposition, viz. That we rely
upon a fpiut of conciliation en the part of <
France, for an accommodation of differences.
And, said Mr, Grifwold, do we really rely
upon this? Have we such evidence as Ihould
incline us to rely upon it > Have the French
government expressed any inclinationto fettle
the differences fubfilling between them and
us ? The communications which were receiv
ed from the Supreme Executive, do not 1
bear thu complexion. The communication
from the French Minifler to this Executive
does not wear it. Our proclamations are
called injid'tous, our [Minister is insulted and
rejeQed ; and attempts are made to divide
the people of this country from their govern
ment. Is this concliation ? Does it not la
ther appear as if they intended to alienate
the affedions of the people from'their gov
ernment, in order to effeÂ£t their own views ?
He was convinced it did, and that they could
not rely upon a spirit of eonciliation in them.
For hi 3 own part he did not rely upon it ; he
relied upon this country being able to con
vince the world that we are not a divided
people ; that we will not willingly abandon
our government. When the French shall be
convinced of this, they will not treat us with
indignity. Therefore, he trusted, as the
proposed amendment did not contain such
sentiments as were likely to accord with the
feelings of the eommittet r that it would be
rtje&ed.
As to entering into a lengthy discussion in
behalf of different meafures&f government,
he did not think it neceffaiyt. If, indeed,
there had been a motion made to strike out
any part of thereported answer, which went
to an approbation of those measures, such a
discussion might be indulged. As this was
Cot the cafe, he Ihould decline it.
Mr. Nicholas said he was very sorry that
he fhauld be again under the necessity of trou
bling the committee with an explanation of
the proposition which he had submitted to
their consideration.
They had been told by the gentleman lalt
Up that It had three obje&s, viz. to make a
new ap;ilogy for the French Governm:nt, to
<3ifl:ate what terms the Executive Ihould use
toieftore a good understanding between the
two countries, aad to fay that wa rely upo<
a spirit of conciliation on the part of France
for an accommodation
He believed the gentlemen had wholly
toiftaken the proposition. In the firft place
it contained 110 apology for the conduit of
France. In this tefpefl he had not gone far
ther than the report itfelf, or the President.
OA the contrary.it would be fotlnd that the
proposition expieffed the strongest difjppro
bation of the conduftof the French Gov
ernment to our minilter, and. went on to fay,
that if it were followed by similar measures,
jt would put an end to every friendly relation
between the two counnies. This (hewed a
disposition for a restoration of a good under
standing if it could be had ; if not, that all
friervdlhip would be at an end. Did not the
gentleman wilh this ? Did he come here
with his sword ready whetted for war ? He
:hoped ntn ; he'trufted there was not amem
iber M that House who did not widi to pie
feive thi peace of the country, if it could
be ds>ne. If this were not the cafe, or i !
no serious expeditions of fticcefs were ex
pedledfroma new Envoy, Why fend him :
Hi trusted negotiations would be fucrffs
"fnl. He was seriously desirous of preferv
iug the peace of the country; he did not
le"ve borne to attend his duty ig that house
for the purpose of declaring Wai, but of
preserving Peace if possible.
That the proposition contain* a kind ol
direftion to thePrefident, he allowed, which
the gentleman might call didnting, if he
plea fed. He would ask what the President
hid done with refpcH to them ? Had he not
freely t<Jd them what he thought was proper
for them to do? If they were not in return
fay what they thought was proper, and
upon vrhÂ»t terms they would, or would not
le reconciled to France, how could the
Executive proceed with any certainty in his
negotiation. Was not the power of war
committed to him ? [No was heard frota dif
ferent quarters]. In effefl, he said, it were
so ; for if they were net petnpined to (ay

liberty, why not exrrcifc ft ocw ? "
Ibe 3d part, which the gentleman from ],
Conweflicut had given to his proposition, 'j
was not contained in it, viz. that we relied h
on a spirit of coiTcilirrion in France for ac- v
commodntion. read that part of his
proposition]. He did oot fav that there was
a spirit of conciliation in that country upon
which we could defend. He was forty to t(
fay he could not even allure himfelf there was p
such a disposition in this ; and if he harl not tl
an afiurance of this disposition in his own ti
country, he could not be supposed to rely a ;
upon it in Fiance. If a mutual spirit of con- j
cfliationdid exill (it was his intention to
fay) it would be a fufficient foundation far
peace. This was his meaning, and he hoped \ "
it wonld not be perverted. J!
No member appearing inclined to rife, as- ; f|
ter Mr. Nichols had fat down, there was a f<
call for the queAion. < cl
Mr. Gih3 said thefubjjft under discussion ' l
r i CI
was a very important one. It appeared to ; 1(
him, from various documents that all the !
Heps taken by the Executive had a viirw to j
an eventual appeal to arms, which it was his j
wilh (as it was the wilh of many in that j
House) to avoid. It was proper, therefore, j
that theclalhing opinions {hould be discussed. |
If the proposition brought forward for this i 1
purpose was not fufficienlly simple and ex- "
plicit, he wiflied it might be made more so. f
For he believed the queltioo to be, whether I
the committee be prepared to' pals a vote, n
approving of the whole course of the con- c
du<3 of the Executive, or whether France '
Ihould be put upon the fame ground with the k
other Belligerent Powers. That (he is at f
present upon the fame footing, no gentleman c
had attempted to Ihew. Gentlemen who 1
wished to get rid of this ground, fay this is a r
thing which Ihould be left to the Executive. Â£
He thought it was however a proper fubjeit I
for their discussion ; for whatever power the t
Executive had with refpeft to making of
treaties, the House had the means of checking Â«
that power. Suppose said Mr. G. I were on 1
this occasion called upon to tax my land, was t
it not neccffary I Ihould enquire into the '
ful.jeft, and endeavour to avoid a measure f
which wovld probably prove a serious drain >
upon the blood and treasure of the country ? t
He was unwilling to hare his land taxed for
the purpose of supporting a war on this prin- >
ciple. It was evident that the French took '
one ground in this dispute, and the United '
States another, and wbilft this continued to
be the cafe, no negociation would have any '
effedt. Indeed, said he, it is war ; and if
he measure proposed was taken, we make
war if we do not declare it.
He had merely thrown out these ideas ; if
r;o gentleman was prepared to go into the
fubjeft, he Ihould move that the committee
_uow rife, report proprefs, and ask leave to t
(it again. c
Mr. VV. Smith hoped the committee would <
not rife. He thought the belt way of coming ]
to an ur.derftandjng of ihf proposition would be
to difcufsit. If it were notunderftood,it would ,
be Wrong to vote for it ; but he believed it was
well nnderllood. He thought the gentleman '
f: om Connedlicut (Mr. Grilwold j had given a 1
clear a'nalvfis of it. He hoped gentlemen would, '
therefore, either proceed in the or I
take a vote upon the queltion ; for as they could ]
not proceed with any other fubjeift until this was
disposed of, it would osly be a v/afle of time
for the committee now to rife.
Mr. Hartley commenced some observations
on the amendment, wfct n the chairman inform- 1
ed him the motion before them, was whethÂ»r
the committee Ihould rife,
Mr. Giles withdrew his motion.
Mr. Hartley said gentlemen argued as if the
adoption of the jiifwer as reported, would be to
declare war. He thought no fucli thing. It
was the wilh of the friends of the repoTt (at least
it was his wilh) to prefervethe country in peace,
but to place it in a slate of defence j but he hel
ped it would not be taken for granted, that e
very proposition in the speech of the President
v would be carried into effe>Jl. He hoped they
hould continue to discuss the queflion. At pre
sent he was decidedly againll the amendment.
Mr- Baldwin' said he had taken the liberty to
txprefshis concern several years ago,thatthiscuf
tsm ofanfÂ«ering thePrefident'sfpeech whichwas
but a mere piece of public ceremony, Ihould call
up and demand expressions of opinion on all the
important business of the fefficn, while the
members were yet Handing with theii hats in
their hands, in the attitude of receiving the com
munications and had not yet read or opened
the papers which were the ground of their be
ing called together. It applied very strongly
in this inltance, as this was a new Congress,
and a greater proportion than common of new
members. He thought it an unfavourable atti
tude in which to be hurried into the very midst
f things, and to anticipate business of such vail
importance to the country, before they had time
to attend to the info-mation which had been
submitted to them. He trusted some fit occa
sion would before long be found to difinrumber
themfelvei Â«f a ceremony now in this country,
which tended only to evil and to increasing efa
barrafsments âHe observed that it was under
the influence of these impressions, he had made
it a rule to himfelf for ipany feflions to vote for
those amendments and thoie propositions in the
address which were mfcft delphic and ambigu
ous, and while they were refpeiftful to the Pre
sident, left the house unpledged and open te take
up the business of the l'effion as it presented it
felfin its ordinary course. It wasonthisground
he Ihould vote for the amesdment now under
consideration.
He also noticed three particulars, in which he
thought the proposed amendment preferable to
the report of the committee, ift. The report
of the ccmmitte had in it twice repeated general
and indefinite approbation of the measures of
the executive towards foreign nations, when it
was well known that a majority of the house
i had for four years pall, been of a different o
pinion, and it mult be supposed many of the
prefect house were of a different opinion.âHe
thought it well not to Hep out of their course
' to express- any opinion on that fubjeiil, or to
court opposition. a. He thought the address
* contained too many epithets and superlatives.
c It was a flile of writing which wijl became

to remove thrfe u.'jetflinns from the report with- '

too low on the othÂ«r extreme ; the word fenfi
bihty, in the sth line, vnigtst be changed into
indignation, for once, and in ftvcral other pla
ces by the change of a word, it might be exaft
ly graduated to the temper of the houle. 3. '
There Wasone thought in the amendmentwhiÂ«h
he wished to be contained in the address, which
was not in the report of the committee, vi/. the
hope of fuectfsfrom fending an envoy extraor
dinary to treat specially on the grievances 1 om- j
plained of, free Ihips making free goods, articles
of contraband, &c. on the basis ot flri<Â£\ equali
to foreign natians, as to the objection that ex
prefling thi6iwifli is to the executive on
thefubjeift of treaties, and therefore uncondi
tional, he thought the objefiion had equal force a
again K the whole address, and all ar.fwers to the
President's fpeechÂ«t, which are nothing but ex
preffioÃf of eongratulations,or opinions, or w i(h
es on executive rneafures.
Yesterday in ihc House of Reprcfentatives, the a
mendment ot Mr. Nicholas 10 the reported anlwer ii
to the speech of the President, was again under con
fidera ion. Mr. Giles occupied three hours in a
speech in Favor ot the amendment : Mr. Gallatin ll
followed him on the fame ftde, and the fitting was
doled by a lew rbfeivations from Mr. W. Smith on
fomeexpreffions which fell from Mr. Gallatin. The
committee of the whole reported piogrcfs, end had
leave to fit again.

BANKS OF THE MEIN, March 15. \
General Mack is momently expe&ed at {
the head-quarters of the imperial army on the (
Rhine. The general of artillery, count La- ,
tour, has the chief command of the army, (
and general Baron de Stadaar that of the im- .

STRASBURGH, March 20.
The head quarters of the army of the ]
Rhine and Mofclle, are to ba removed from j
Schiltigheim, to Mollheim, a small town four
leagues from hence.
The last advices received from Italy, by
way of Lucerne and Huninguen., we learn (
that all remained quiet in that quarter ; but
the movements of the two armies portended
some decisive affair.
Buonaparte remained some time at Bolog- (
na, and then set out to which (
latter place he will go to Cifmune, the head ,
quarters of Maffeua.
Purfuaat to the above news tranquility
was restored at Turin.
The Banks of the Rhine are furnifhed
with Aultrian troops, in a manner truly
alarming to the inhabitants in those parts ;
they go in gieat numbers to Mayence.
The French generals at Duffcldorff jnd
Cologne, are prepaiing to open the cam
paign immediately.
The French army 00 the right bank of
the Rhine, amounts to 36,000 men ; it is (
under the command of Gen. Macdonald, ,
who acquitted himlelf with fa much honor
during the campaign of 1794-* '**â '
my ot the North.
The divifiou of Bernadette, which was to
have joined the army of Buonaparte, is re
placed by a divifiou of the Army of . the
Ocean..
BRUSSELS, ATarch 26.
The division of the army of the North,
commanded by gen. il/acdonald, as also all
the French troops in the pay of the Repub

provinces, have received ofders to march im
mediately to the borders of the Rhine, â
where the -Republican armies are daily in
ctieafing, by the ntrmerous reinforcements
which arrive from the old and new depart
ments of France. Yesterday and to day
1 pa fled by this place on their way to the ar
my, reinforcements of cavalry, 'artillery with
: their ordnance, and riflemen. Convoys of
s ammunition, cannon and military (tores regu
larly arrive.
I Letteis from the borders Rhine
â  mention, that they every moment expeft hof
tiliiies to commence. Several generals and
: principal officers belonging to the army ot

From the Connecticut Gazette.
Mr. Printer,
AT a time when thi United Stales
threatened from disTensions within, and a
powerful nation in Europe ; a friend to the
peace and bappinefs of t.is eountry, wishes
through the of your valuable paper,
tu ufler a few serious thoughts to the candid
corilideration of the public.
Waving all difputesabout the re&itude of
the federal adminiilalion, in refpeft to F.ng
lasd and France ; for the fake of the utmoit
fairnefs, even admitting it like all human pro
ceedings," to have been fallible and wrong in
some inilances, let us attend to a fet.of men
in this country, in regard to the piracies and
depredations committed by French privateers
and ships of wat on the American commerce,
by the express order of their government, in
fciredl violation of their treaty with this coun
try. The common language with these men
is, " that we jullly deserve this treatment be
cause we have been ungrateful to France
Some even of public officers, have openly de
clared " that they were glad - the French
treated us in this manner." The language
of these men is too ridiculous, and deteltable,
to be considered with calmness : Have we
not a constitution the bed in the world ?
Was not this c.onfljtution adopted in the
faireft manner (by the voice of a free and
enlightened people) of any in the world?
Were not the members of government who
adminidered this constitution, freely ele&cd
by a free people ? Did Americans, like the
French, ever submit to a decree of the federal
convention, for electing two thirds of their
own body to adminider the government ? Is
not the federal government, considered in
every point of view, the mod legal, the mod
free, and mod equitable of any government
in exidence ?* Do not the obligations of a
people to ftipport their government, arise in
pioportion to its lcgaliyand excellence?
| Do not the independence and political ex
igence of' America, depend upon the union
of the people? Is a union possible so long as
a large party is vlllifying the government,
and inviring the French to ruin coun
try ? Do not the present depredations of the
French become chargeable to these men?
Are not they the pirates who have ruined the
American commerce ? Are net they the
traitors whs are in rebellion againd their
own government ? Are not these men" the
feourges of their country, and the cuife and
plague of society?
A true Republican.
