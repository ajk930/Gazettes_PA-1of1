INTO THE
ORIGW OF E I'IbEMIC DISEASES.
THE Letters to Dr. Currie, which I puhliihed
tafl autumn, led me to an invelligation of
thÂ« origin and phenomena of peftiluntial diseases
in other countries, as well as in the United St tes.
In the profrcutioi, of the fubjeiSt, new fadts and
principles continually opened to my view, and fi
nally determined me to trace back the history of
such diseases as far as the records of history ex
tend. For this purpose, I have examined the pub
lic libraries in Njcw-York, Ntw-Havea, Cam.
bridge and Boston, with a view to obtain all the
material fa.sh which can'illuftrate the fubjÂ«<st,and
1 have nearly collected ill the materials for the
proposed work.
The faiSts e.lLileil will enable me to demon
strate that many of the common ideas refpe&ing
pestilential epidemics, are nnfounded or extreme
ly in correct ; and this in consequence of ir.edica!
writers considering an epidemic disease as a detach
ed or isolated phenomenon in a particular 'coun
try ; rather thaa as connected with other epide
mics or other phenomena of nature in various
parts of the world. The fa<9s I have collected
lead to certain dedttiSions which are furprifingto
jnyfell, and whic-h will probably be new to many
others. Much light will hÂ« thrown on this dark
and perplexing fubjeA, as well as on natural phi
lofffphy. j
The propofet}-vorlc wiil make a full sized oÂ«5la- c
sro volume ; and execute* well on fine paper, can- ,
not be afforded at li:ls than two dollars, bound, ,
with the usual allowance to book fellers. As thÂ« t
compilation will cost not only great laber.but con- c
Cderable expence, n-> more copies will be printed c
than tofnpplyfobfcrlbcrs. The hook will be rea- j,
dy for fuMcriber searly iu the coming summer, and t
the holders of propofalt will be good tnough to ,
retqrn them to No. 40, Pine-street, by the firflof |
May.

By thepolitenefsof a g of this city, '
we have been favoured Â« .th
v FLYN's HIBERNIAN CHRONICLE, f
To the Bth of March, 1
I-'rom which we have copied the following 1
articles : 1
LONDON, February ii, 12, 23, and 24. 1
FliOM TW: COURIER. <
The moll important intelligence is given in
the Pari* gazettes, from the Bth to the 18th '
iii/iaut, inclulive, which werÂ£ brought to us â¢
this morning by express.
The article which fird claims attention is
the following, relative to the seizure ofEn- 1
glifh merchandize at Hamburg, and the shut- '
ting up of that port againd the commerce of Â«
England : '
" The Senate of Hamburg did not hesitate
a moment to comply with all the demands
which Leonard bourdon was charged to make
in the name of the Directory.
" The presence of the emigrants being in- '
compatible with that of the Envoy of the
French Republic, in 24 hours after his arri- 1
val, notice was given to them, at the found of 1
trumpet, that they were to qyit immediately
the town, which till then had been, as it were,
their capital. 1
" All the Englifli merchandize was instant
ly seized (fequedrees,) the Englilh expelled, '
and this free port, for the firft time, was shut
agiinft all the veflels of these tyrants of the
sea.
" Citizen Legot, Consul General from the
French Republic at Hamburg has revived an 1
c'd law, which direits the Consul General '
of France in I.ower Saxony, to convoke, at
regular periods, jhe members of his nation 1
who (hould reside at Hamburg, to confer with
them 011 all fubjeifls that might their 1
country in consequence of which, on the 7th â¢
Pluviofe, (the 26th of January,) heconvoked '
a meeting of the French who were then in
the town of Hamburg, and read to them a ]
circular letter, addrefled by the Minister of '
Foreign Affairs to all the Agents diplomatic j '
and Confolaries of the French Republic the j â¢
14th of Nivofe lad. He addrefted them in a| 1
Ipeech marked by that patriotifrn and folem- 1
nity which could not fail to excite the mcft
lively interest. He dwelt particularly on this H
part of the letter of the Miuider for Foreign t ]
Affairs:â" It is nereflary that all parts of I '
the Frencli Republic lliould at this moment j '
enter into the war England." After
this speech, all the French who were present
determined to open three regiders ; one for 1
the loan for the expedition aaaind England ; i '
another for voluntary contribution ; and ;; 1
third to contain the names of those French- j
men who shall enter into- an engagement not |
to purchase any cloth or other article of En
glish manufacture until a peace fliall have been 1
concluded with that power. It was also de- :
tliey Ihould meet at lead four j 1
times a vear, to concert 011 the proper means ! j
of aiding the Great Nation. The Consul j
n.i'e a contribution of 300 livres, and signed [
?r ' ution not to make use of any article of
L ,ufh .iiannfaihire." ' j I
One of tiie belt informed of the Paris jour- j
nals contain the following letter from Ham
burg, dated the 27th of January : ! 1
" It darsd, tlrat in compliance with the |
demand of the French Republic, no more !
packet-boats will pass between London and
this town."
" Letters from Hambfirg fay, that no more
packets are to pair, between that town and
London, and that, since the arrival of Leonard
Bourdon, the emigrants jire ordered to quit 1
the place."
The Echo of the fame date fays,
" It appears certain that the Senate of |
Hamburg lias accededlo the demands of Leo- i
nard Bourdon, and tha 1 * 24 hours after his I
arrival, all the emigrants received orders to
leave the town and its terr:tory. The English
were driven (chafTes) from the town and the
Englifn merchandize seized."
The Journal des Campagnes contains the
fame article as the Moniteur and the Chro
-1 Â»iaue.
' FROM THE SUN.
A letter from Hamburg mentions that 110-
thing is confirmed of the reporti in circulation
rel\ 'ecting that city, except that the Senate
has replied to the demand of Leonard Bour
don 1 elative to the expuliion of the French e
jnigit nts, that several of these persons having
acquit -d the rights of citizens thare, could
not be driven from thence without an infrac
tion of the constitutional law of the (late.
The . ImpcriaPdeputation of the Congress
of Radlh 'dt, having, in a note which they de
livered t. > the French Plenipotentiaries/de
clared thÂ» t they could not confcnt to the ses
sion of tin - left bank of the Rhine ; that the
indemnify ition of the Princes who had pof
felTions on the left bank wtre at the expence
ofthoCeon the right, and the secularization
of the Eleil orates ar, I B.flioprics, is impiac
tical'le j v conclude with praying that the
French Minifc 'ers would propbfe more reason
able bases fok r the peace * hich is to be con
cluded.
The French Plenipotentiaries replied in a |
note dated thei'9th of Jan. in which they pro- |
mile to tranfmil the note of the deputation to
the Direflory, h at observe that the Constitu
tion of the Empi re will not be altered by the
diminution of its territory. They infill upen
the Rhine being t he boundary of the Repub
lic, which they fa v is neceflary both for the
security of France iind the tranquility of Ger
many. â¢
011 the 31ft, the (Deputation of the Empire
delivered a (econd iiote to the French Mini
ster*. They express their fatisfattidn in learn-"
ing that their deliberations refpedling the
boÂ°undary of the Rhine, had been sent to tne
French Government which they hope will
acknowledge the importanceof their demands.
They, maintain, that the preliminaries ligned
at Leoban, are erttirelv in their favour, which
they infill ought to form the basis of the trea
ty of Peace. *
Relative to the threatened descent on this 1
country, the Monituer fays.
" It appears that it will be a genera! attack,
not partial ones, that will be attempted against
England. Generics Defaix, Kleber, and
Dufalga, are gone to make a partial survey of
the coalt ; thcyfet out with Buonaparte, who
will visit all the different places wl'.ch bor
der the channel and the ocean, and will trace
the plan of a descent with that superiority of
talents which has hitherto insured the luc
sefs of every thing which he has attempted.
â¢' A chain of cantonments has been cftab
liflied from Oflend to the extremity of the
boast of the ci-devant Dutch Flanders All
the pods have fignats fur cotrtmunication.
This measure is intended to prevent the in
troduflion ot English merchandize, which u
fed to take place by the Scheldt, conducted
by bodies of armed men."
Notwithflamling every thing that has been
said in the English newspapers on theauthori.
ly of Englilh fallors who had lately quittej
France, nothing till now had appeared in the t
French Journals on the fubjeit of the rafts, t
or any veflfels of a novet.conftruilion, except t
extraÂ£ls from the London prints. The Chro
ivique, however, ot the 17th, faysâ c
" Citizen Prinet, artist, has just submitted {
to the Diretlorj a plan for a floating camp, I
composed of vessels ofan ablolutely new con- I
llrutlion, and of which the solidity shall be <
such that it will be capable of refilling the ef
fects of the sea, and all the attacks of the e- 1
nemy. The author proposes to conflruil <
this camp of a fufficient size to contain 100,000 _ 1
men. A number of diflinguifhed artifls have 1
fcen this plan, and have deemed it worthy of J
fixing the attention of the government." -1
One of the papers dates, that nineteen-*, ef- |
fels from the Mediterranean have joined the
Spanish fleet at Cadiz.
One of the Demi-official Journals of the
nfhfays, " We can allure our readers, that
General Berthier entered Rome on the 10th
of February. On the 7th one division of his
armv was at Spoletto, and the other at Fo
ligno.
The mod important intelligence in the lad
Paris papers is an article in L'Echo, of the
20thinll. which dates that a MefTage was sent
by the Directory to the Council of Five Hun
dred, on the fitting of the 19th, announcing
that the republican troops had entered Rome
in the 10th ind. and had taken poffelTion of
the St. Angelo, and thecapitol.
Miiilfters, it is repiÂ«ttd, have received ad
vice from France, through a very rcfpectable
channel, that a descent upon this country is
artually to be attempted, in various directi
ons, early in april, by an army of 300,000 men.
The anxiety of the public ref'pedting the
fate of Hamburgh is now completely done a
way, the third of the fix mails that were due
having arrived lad night. The principal ar- â¢
ticles-of intelligence which it brings have
been anticipated by the Paris Journals, as the
present packet left Cruxhaven so long ago as
the 6th inllant.
It appears that the French, without wait
ing the result of the negociations at Radadt,
are poflefling themselves of whatever places
they think necelTary, on the Banks of the
Rhine*. They have taken poireffion of one of
the forts of the Rhine after a fevcre conted,
in which they lod 3000 men. The besieged
had 5000 privates taken prisoners. They were
i alio preparing to take polfellion of Ehrenbreit
dein which was to have been summoned on
i the 30th ult.
A letter from Vienna, dated the 27th tilt,
-â¢arcntiojis that an Aullrian Prince is to be ap
| pointed Governor of Venice. A flotilla will
j immediately be fitted out in tha harbour of
that city.
March iâ2.
It appears that the Spanish fleet has eluded
the vigilance of that under the command of
earl St. Vincent, and has failed out of the har
bour of Cadiz.
I The following letter reached 11s this morn.
Portsmouth, February 18.
" This day arrived his majedy's frigate A
rethufa, of 40 guns, Capt. Wollcy, from the
flefet under the command of Earl St. Vincent,
giving an account of the Spanish grand fleet,
confiding of 16 fail of the line and 6 frigates,
having failed from Cadiz on the night of the
6th ind. supposed for Bred, and that they
had escaped the fleet commanded by admiral
1 lord St. Vincent. If they are bound to Bred
it is feared they will form a jitnftion with the
French fleet, as we have only 3 fail of the line
! cruing off Bred, who, it is not improbable,
: may unfortunately fall into their hands, and,
; at any rate cannot attempt to refid their going
i into the port of Bred. A reinforcement wilt
undoubtedly be ordered to sea,
FROM THE SUN.
Captain Wol.tey, of the Arethufa frigate,
which came into Plymouth from a cruifie on
I Monday lad, arrived'yederday at-the Admi
| ralty office. He brings intelligence of his
j having fallen in with a neutral velTel, the maf
-1 terof which informed him that the Spanish
I fleet, confiding of 25 (hips of the line, were
lat sea. The maderof the neutral vellel adds,
that Lord St. Vincent's fleet was likewifeout,
and that the Englilh frigates were in fight of
the Spanish Ihips.
The Portsmouth letter varies in its date
ment from the account received in town yes
terdayâbut we are inclined to believe that
the latter is the most correfl.
The Direftory have published an arret to
the following eftect :
1 " As the different intereds implicated in
the execution of the articles of the Treaty of
Campo Formio, and every other objetl con
nected with the present negotiation^between
; the French Republic and the German Em
pire are tÂ» be regulated at Radadt, the Exe
cutive Diredtorf resolve, that all Commillio
ners, Envoys, or Agents, of any description,
from the PrinceS, Towns, and Stata of Ger
many, having an interell in the negociation of
Radadt, and coming into France upon that
business, shall not be received.-
: " That the AmbalTadors and French Min
isters in foreign countries shall refufe pasT
; ports to all persons who fay they are appoint
t cd to treat with the French government upon
the part of any of the powers intereded in the
: negociation opened at Radadt. That all so
. reign Envoys who are not accredited to the
French Government, and not acknowledged
by it, or who have not an express permiflion
i ! to remain in Paris, shall leave it in three days,
- | and the territory of the Republic in 6 days af
-3 ter. That those who have communications
- to make to the French government, relative
e to the a (lairs which come under the confider
a ation of the Congress at Radadt, may write
- either direflly to the Executive Diretlory, or
e to the Miniderfor Foreign Affairs."
I.etters from Vienna date, that his Imperi
al Majedy has determined to fend neither
1: AmbaflTadors nor Ministers to the free States
of Italy; there will be only simple Residents
- from the Imperial Cabinet in these countries,
e The Cisalpine Republic wilt ofcourfe decline
e fending an Amball'ador to Vienna, as was once
I intended.
A letter from Hamburg, dated February 6,
d received at Hull, faysâ" There is noproba
h bility of any power whatever prohibiting the
- importation at our port ; our situation, in
many refpecls, w ill not allow i:. The report
s in the newspapers in your country refpeiling
such and other matters of humility in our
c, neighbourhood are ridiculous, and it is fur-
It priling how they can be credited,
id Margate, February 21.
>f Five persons have keen apprehended here
10 this morning by two of the Bow-dreet officers,
r- upon suspicion of carrying on a treasonable
:e correspondence with the French government,
sf The most material paper yet discovered, is an
:- address from the Secret Committee in fre
land, to the Frencli Directory, soliciting them
)- immediately to coine over, and dating in very
ic llrong terms, the exhaufted-relourccs, failure
.11 of forced contributions, universal difaffeilion
n. and that millions would joyfully join the He
ro*of Italy.
1 The chief of them diles himfelf Colonel
rd Morris; three others appear his companions j
and the other a lad, their servant.
:n The officers have just fat oft with them un
1. dcr a guard.
: d They were yeflerday at Whitcllable, where
they aflually agreid with the mafler of a boat 1
to carry them over for 130 guineas, aftd to I
deposit 300 more as a security for his velfel.
This being mentioned to the officers of the
cu floras, he searched a great quantity of bag
gage belonging to theiji, which making them
suspicious, they set off for this place, when
he immediately sent off a messenger to inform
our officef of it.
The Bow-street officers who had been in
queftof them, arrived here this morning, and
when they apprehended them, no part of their'
baggage, not even their great coats, would
they acknowledge to belong to them.
[ By the letters from Constantinople which
came over in the last mail, it appears that the
Porte is making uncommon preparations for
war, with an intent, as is supposed, to repel
any attack from the French. Apichepelago
are required to fend money or sailors, not ac
cording to the proportion observed in all for
mer wars, but the double of what has evej
been required of them. To the Capt. Pacha,
who is a great favorite of the Sultan's, has
geen given a command against the rebel Pa
chas of Romelia. He is suspeCted of being a
strong Jacobin. The Divan,as he isfo much
in favour of the Sultan, have not dared to
propose cutting him off, but have removed
him in this manner. TheTurkifh fleet is be
coming very refpeftahle, having been aug
mented, by several new ships, among which
are three-deckers, by Mr. Lebruu, a famous
(hip-builder.
The French are very busy in Greece, in
preaching revolutionary doctrines to the in
habitants, who, impatient of theTurkifii ty
ranny, hear with rapture all proposals to
emancipate them, and as eagerly embrace the
French caufeas they did the Ruflian on other
occasionS;
The French Ambassador, M. Dubayet,
lately died at Constantinople. His burial is
the (abject of conversation now among the
Turks as well as Christians. The coffin was
covered with two flags, and carried by officers,
four boys fnpported the ends of the flhgs.â
' He was buried in the garden of the Palace,
without any religious ceremony, except that
the French sung one of their songs. When
the coffin was let down, each Republican
threw in a handful of earth. It concluded
by planting cypress trees in the grave.
PARIS, February 20.
An article from Raftadt, of the sth instant,
informs us, that the obstinacy with which the
French Plenipotentiaries infill u-pon their o
vemires to the Left Bank of the Rhine, has
greatly aifconcerted the Envoys of the Em
pire, These deliberated much, without dis
covering any effectual means of escaping the
difficulties in which they were entangled. It
is said they finilhed by ordering that the pa
pers of the Negociation should be sent to the
Diet at Ratifbon, and that themembers should
be prepared to vote, in one of their next (it
tings, on the qu'eftion submitted toihem.
Letters from Vevay of the 16th inft. state,
that the Oligarchs of Berne have taken pof
felfionof. Arran with their troops : the Con
tingent of Zurich, however, refufed to join in
the expedition. General Menard and Gene
rol Schomberg immediately entered the terri
tory of Berne, the firft by the way of the Pays
de Vaud ; the fecend by fide of Eguel.
The Pays de Vaud has adopted the consti
tution (ent from Paris to the canton of Bade by
citizen. Ochs.
Buonaparte is this moment at Dunkirk.
One of the objects of his jourgey to that place,
is to fee experiments performed by the gun
boats of a new construCtion which are intend
ed to be employed in the expedition against
England.
It Is spoken of as a thing certain that M
d'Aranjo will be brought to trial ; but it is
not said before what Tribunal.
The inhabitants of the city of Bienne have
unanitnoufly voted their union with France.
Yesterday letters were received, Hating
Buonaparte to have been seen at Calais.âTo
day we hear that he was seen on the road,
looking at his carriage, which had been de
layed bv some accident that rendered it ne
cessary to be repaired. We know ourselves,
that wagers have been confidently laid that
Buonaparte is at this moment at his lodgings
in the Rue de la ViCtoire.
LONDON, February 17.
Letters by yesterday's mail from Lisbon, da
ted the ultimo, are silent respeCting the
treaty of peace reported, in letters from Paris,
to have been concluded between that Court
and the French republic.
There was a French National corvette, of
12 guns, brought into Lisbon some days pre
vious to the-failing of the Prince of Wales,
taken by a Portuguese frigate, after a fliort
aflion. The French captain declared, after
he had (truck, and was brought on board the
Portuguese frigate, that he never would have
struck to hi.n, but he really thought, as did
all his officers, that it was an English Hoop of
war. 1 ,
A letter received from a refpeclable house |
in Leith, dated the 13th instant, fays, " An
order has been issued at North Bergen, and at
the other ports in Norway, from the French
Directory, ordering all the British vessels ly
ing captured to be entirely ftript to the hull,
and set on fire, allowing 60 livres per ton to
the captors for each ship destroyed.
On Wednesday last, Sir James Marriott,
Knt. Judge of the Admiralty Court, made
his report to his Majesty of George Jay, con
victed at the Admiralty Session held at the
Old Bailey, on the nth of December lass, for

was pleased to order the law to take its course,
and the Lords of the Admiralty have ordered

The dispatches received by the Lisbon mail,
wliich arrived oh Friday, stateâthat the Ex
ecutive Directory has made a formal demand
of the Court of Spain for permiflion to inarch
50,000 troops through' that country for the
attack on Portugal, which demand the weak
Cabinet of Madrid has complied with, altho'
the consequences are so obvious.
The Council of Madrid did not agree to
grant the * iflage required until after repeated
deliberations during four days. One party of
the Council was of opinion that there waslefs
danger in holtilities, which the Directory
threatened in cafe of refufat", than in acceding
to the demand of marching Republican troops
through the country. But the other party
having the greatelt preponderance, the mea
sure was carried. Time will /hew its conse

We have authority to state, in the molt di

between the Lord Lieutenant and Lord Chan

Yesterday several mercantile hotvfes received
letters from Lisbon, via by a pri
vate snip. Those letters (late, in general terms,
that the Portuguese in the capital are very
rtnich alarmed at the march of the French
troops through Spain, to attack Portugal, in
two divifiops. The Portuguese minilter is
taking the mod vigorous measures to make
them repent their rashness. There are now
eighty thousand, as fine troops as any in Eu
rope, and the great body of the people are to
raise enmaffe to preserve their property against
those marauders, who firft promise protection,
but finirti with plunder and deftruCtion.
The Amelia frigate is now lying in Ply
mouth Sound, between two feventy-four's,
as a guard. It appears, that lately (he was
at anchor for day and night near the mouth of
Brest harbour, almost within gun-(hot of the
forts, and constantly, during that time, rowed
guard, so as to prevent (urprife : it happened
that a sailor, in irons, reported to the Captain,
in the mean while, that the crew formed the
resolution of murdering all the Officers and
carrying the (hip into the midst of the French
fleet ; early in the morning all the officers
came on deck doubly armed ; the marines
were then drawn out, and loaded their pieces
with ball cartridgeâon this the captain of the
(hip observed to the detachment that a mo(t
alarming mutiny existed on board, and that, if
it refufed doing its duty, he and his brother
officers, being well armed, would join in put
ting as many of them to death as poflible ; as
to iheir own lives, they did not value them
at all. Immediately afterward the (hip's com
pany were called up, and took their posts for-,
ward, when the captainaddre(Ted them spirit
edly, at the fame time ordering the marines to
present, and (fating, that unless within a given
number of minutes, they gave up the ling
leaders, he would order the whole detachment
to pour a volley in amongfl them; this had
the desired effect, and the men now in irons
were given up. *
Captain Herbert, to whose resolution and
gallantry the quelling of the mutiny on board
the Amelia frigate is entirely owing, has been
one of the molt fortunate and fuccefsful offi
cers in the service, having in the courfeof the
present war realised near 20,0001. of prize
money.
The late mutineers 011 board the Amelia
frigate, belonged to the Saturn in the mutiny
last year, and carried this diabolical f'pirit with
them, which they by degrees diffufed through
all the-failors of the ship.
A man yesterday went to the war-office to
lay an information against a person in the city,
for having in his poffeftion 2000 instruments
called cats. âHe was referred to the Duke of
Portland's office.
Came in the French brigartrne Branch
d'Olive, laden with wine, brandy, and flour,
bound from Bordeaux to Brest; the was taken
the 7th jnff. iathe night, by his majesty's ship
Amelia, of 44 guns, capt. Herbert ; (lie failed
seven days since from Bordeaux, in company
with 32 fail, all laden with provifinos, &c. for
Brest, and when the Amelia fell in with the
fleet they all dispersed, 16 of them put into
different creeks along Iboce, marfy others are
supposed to have-been captured by the Ame
lia, and may be hourly expected : the above
vessel was formerly the blive Branch of Li
verpool, and lately captured by the French.
DUBLIN, Feb. 10.
It is reported that the ruling powers of the
country, having found all experiments under
the system of coercion and espionage not only
ineffectual for the pijrpofes deligned, but
hourly productive of the contrary effects, have
at length resolved on lenient measures, which
..are to commence with a general goal delivery
of all the persons now confined in the dif
ferent goals throughout the kingdom under
charge of being United Iriflimen, oncondition
of their taking the oath of allegiance, and
giving security be of the peace for seven

CORK, March 8.
VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS
DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY.
Cork, Feb. 23, >798.
At a numerous and respectable meeting of
the merchants, bankers, traders, and
other inhabitants of Cork, convened in
the City Tholfel, in consequence of
public notice from Robert Hardiag and
John Tobart, jun. Efqrs. High She
riffs, the following resolutions having
been propofedby John Anderfon, Esq.
and seconded by Richard Lane, Esq.
were unanimously agreed to :
I. That at a moment wher, war isobfli
nately persisted in, by an iafulting and fe
rocious enemy, for the avowed purpofeof
destroying, not only the conftiturion, the
religious and civil rights, but also the na
tional independence of these kingdoms,
it behoves eveiy true friend to Ireland to
come forward with all his zeal and eneigy,
to .defeat the hostile designs of so inve
terate a foe.
11. That books be immediately opened
to receive fubfciipiionsfor voluntary con
tribu'ions, in dofince of the country, at
this critical and alarming period. To be
paid by quarterly instalments; the firfk
payment to be made on the 25th of March
; next.
111. That every exertion be made to
render those fubfci iptions as productive as
pofiible, being fully convinced that no- Â«
thing tend more than the general suc
cess of such a meafufe, to defeat the pro
jects of the enemy, to maintain public
orcdit, and to accelerate the return of
peace, upon fife and honorable terms.
IV. That the gentlemen who requelled
the High Sheriffs to call this meeting, to
gether with those now named, vix.
The Mayor,
High Sheriffs,
The Bishop of Cork,
Dcaii St. Lawrence,
- The Right Rev. Di. Moylan,
And Collector Shaw (who was ap'*
pointed Treasurer),
Be appointed to carry those
refolulions into effect; (nine to be a quo-,
rum) and the said committee be empower
ed to take such mealures as may appear to
them best calculated to promote the com
plete success of voluntary contribution*
for the defence of the country.
The Sheriff having quilted the chair,
and John Pedder, Esq. being called there
to,
Resolved, That the thanks of this'meet
ing be, and arehereby given to the High
Sheriffs of the city, for their proper con
due.* in the- chair.
The committee having adjourned to the
council chamber, and having elected John
Anderfon, Esq. their chairman,
Refolved,That attendance shall be given
and books kept open in the council cham
ber, from 1a till 3 o'clock, on Saturday
Monday, Tuefdav and Wednesday next,
toefvei reerom their fellow citizens such,
sums as they fhail be inclined to contri
bute. Signed by order,
WILLIAM PHILIPS,
Secretary.
The committee appointed to carry the
above resolutions into effect, feel it their
duty to call the attention of their fellow
citizens to the dangers which just now
threaten the countty, and to the certain
good effects which must result from a
spirited and unanimcfus exertion in its de
fence.
A desperate enemy rendered formidable
by its ferocityavid enthusiasmâaster hav
ing violated every obligation moral and
civil at homeâ-after having trampled up
on the law of nation, and even of civili
zed warfare abroad, is now promi.fed the
plunderâthe uncontrouled, and unlimi
ted plunder of this kingdom, as the re
ward itstreachery, blasphemy and barba
rity, All reasonable overtures forpeace
are rejetted with the insolence of Brava
does who have nothing to lose, but every
thing to obtain by so unequal a confiift.
Can it be credited that fu'ch an enemy is
invited to our shores. âCan any one be
lieve that their hopes of affiflance from I
rishmen., would be eventually realized.--
Let the magnanimity with which persons
of every description flep forward on the
present occasion wipe away so foul an as
persion. The question is not now for
power, but for exillence on our part.
Let 110 man therefore be so {illy as to con
ned the pretent measures with the idle
theories of the day; or to make it a politi
cal question, whether he shall reftft affaf
ftnation and. plunder or submit to the
yrfke of a foreign and o&tfageous Ban
ditti.
.there may be, with intentions
. the most laudible, whofc incomes being
[ circumfcnbed, will be discouraged frotn
' uniting in a voluntary contribution, un
der an ideaâThat the sums they are ena
bled to offer are too trifling to be of
| service for a purpose oif such magnitude
| and extent.âTo such men the committee
declares that the induflrious tridclman,
[ whose sixpenny contribution bears a just
[ proportion to his meansjis as meritorious a
iubfdriber, as the wealthy contributor of
thoulands ; in such a cafe, the intention
marks the giver, and not the magnitude
of th 6 gift.âAnd here the committee in
treat every delcription of their fellow ci
( tizensto consider that all are equallvcon
, cerned in the de/ence of that which as
. fords them the means of existence. The
1 peasant would lament the loss of his
; homely repafl, with as bitter concern as
the peer would his splendid, decorated
board. Both are equally called uponâ
for both are so Far equally interested.

CONG R Â£ S S.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, April ii.
. ( Concluded from yejlerday's Gazette.)
Mr. J. Williams was against discharging
the committee of the whole, and he thought
if the psentleman just fat down would review
his arguments, he would be so to. He com
plained that the money which had been ap
propriated was not expended. Why, if the
money was fpecifically appropriated, it would
not be expended,|if the officers thought it un
neccllary. The gentleman from N. Carolina,
who was opposed to all fortifications, he
should not notice ; the observations of his
colleague as to 3 or 400 miles of coat being
unprotected, would be an argument for in
creasing the amount of the appropriation. He
was forty to hear the gentleman just far down
complaining of a certain state for not having
paid her debts and made cession of the jurif
rlittion of her fortifications, as he said Penn
fylvaniahad done. But he-alked whether the
gentleman could compare the importance of
one fcile with t,hat of the other i As to pay
ing ot debt, he hoped Pennsylvania would
pay her q\\ n, before her representatives call
ed upon others to pay theirs.
Mr. Macon spoke again in favour of the
motion, and an to 'lie inutility ot the fortifi
cations at New-York.
Mr. Bryan was in favour of the motion*
and spoke of the importance of fortifying O
cracock. \
Air. Rutl! DGF. was happy to observe, that
gentlemen who hid, heretofore, huen avefSTe to
fortifying t! ejc untr'y. were now pvptty gene
rally imprefied with the propriety of the mea
sure ; he had long Seen in favor of it, and be
lieving that the critical state of our afTairs re
quited that measures of defence should be imme
dia'ely gont into, he would vote against dif
charg:i< g the committee of the whole. He
deemed it of imp' r'tanre that this hufinefs should
be afled upon with promptitudy, which could
not be the ca!e if appropriations were to be
made in th way proposed by the gen
tleman from Pennfyl*ania ; the house could not
be fuppoled to pofTefs the neceflary information
relpedling the molt pradticable and best points
of defence upon our coast, Snd unTefe foine one
gentleman in every delegation was. an engineer
it would be impollible for the members, from
the different slates, to agree which would be the
Â»noft proper fituatiotu, in their refpeiilive (tales,
for foitificationi : it certainly would be wife
and proper to leave this matter with the Presi
dent, who wilt employ engineers to visit the dif
ferent parts of our extensive coast, and report
immediately the molt proper places to be forti
fied, accompanied with estimates of the expence.
He was not fnrprized that his Irien i from North
Carolina should have his apprehensions strongly
excited by the very unprotected state of the coast
of his slate, hut as he was informed a floating
defence was contemplated, for that part of the
country, he trufled his uneifipefs would be re
moved! the committee, in their estimate ot the
places to be fortified, had not noticed North
Carolina, because they supposed that a moving
defence would be a better defence for its coalt
than fortifications j if, however, gantlemen from
that part of the Union thought differently,
there would be no difficulty in getting provision
made for fortifications. In the eft imate given
in by the committee there is a surplus of 6c,000
dollars, out of which provision may be made tor
erecting forts in North-Carolina, and the Pre
sident (if this hufinefs (hall be left to l.im) will
Certainly do so if the representatives of that
state fay it is neceflary. Mr. R. observed that,
in the course of this debate, the secretary cf war
had Ufen much b!Â«med, for not having expend
ed a!l the money appropriated at the last feflion ;
he believed this fubje& was not propefly before
thecommittee; if it washe was persuaded there
would be no difficulty in juflifyi ig the condudt
â¢f the secretary at war 1 he would, however,
observe, that it had in the last feflion of Con
gress been (fated to the house that the fortifica
tions in fi'me parts of the Uni >n were in ru
ins, and in others mouldering to decay, for
want of men to take care of theÂ»n, yet none had
been provided ; and, in hit opinion, it would
hive been an absurdity to have expended lirge
sumÂ« of money in building forts, when we bad
i.ot 1 fufficient number of artillerifis for garri
soning those in exiftrnce.
Mr.,GÂ»ovi related his solicitude for the
coast of North Carolina.
Mr. Thatcher did not regret that the
money appropriated at the lass leflion was not
expended ; he should be glad to find at the
next feflion that there had been no occasion to
expÂ«nd the money now appropriated. He
was unwilling to recommit the bitl for the
purpose mentioned. There were ports iu
Massachusetts which he could name, which
required tortertion, at leafVas much as those
of North Carolina ; but he was willing to
leave the expenditure of the money* to. the
judgment of the President.
The morion for discharging the committee
of the whole was put and negatived.
The lioufe then resolved itfelf into a com-
I mittee of the whole on this bill ; when
Mr. Blount mo'-ed to amend the firft ]
feflion by inserting all the places which had
been inserted in the original law. ,
This motion was advocated by MefTrs.
Blount, Gallatin, Milledge, and M'Dowell
and opposed by Melfrs Sewall, Gordon,
Pinckney, Dayton and Brooks. It was nega
tived, without a division.
si the course of the observations on this a
mendment, it was said to be improper for
members to .be pointing out the mod weak
and vulnerable parts of the coast, at a time
when we have every reason to expeif a war. 1
In answer to this, Mr. Blount said, that it i
was well known that all parts of our coast are i
weak ; and that no secret of this kind Could
be revealed to France, as a survey of our.coast |
had been made by citizens of that country ,
who were prebably now in France.
Mr. Sewall moved to fill up the blank in 1
the bill with 200,000 dollars. 1
Mr. S. Smith thought, fipce the debate
which had taken place, that 250,000 dollars
would be neceflary, as several places had
been mentioned, had not been coufi
dered by the committee.
Afterfome observations in favourof 250,000
by Mr. Harper and Mr. S. Smith, andagainft
it by Mcffrs. Sewall and Macon, the question
on the largest sum was carried, there being 50
members in favourof it.
Mr. Blount moved to insert three ports
in North Carolina by name. The motion
was negatived, there being only 13 votes in
favour of it.
The bill being gUne through, the commit
tee rose, and th* house entered upon the con
sideration of the bill; when
Mr. Gallatin made a motion similar to the
firft made by Mr. Blount in committee of the
whole, for enumerating the places at which
the money appropriated should be expended,
leaving the President the power of expending
such funis at other places as he (hould think
proper,

PHILADELPHIA,
'â  WEDNESDAY EVENING, April i*.
Yesterday at noon a large and refpedtable
| body of the merchants and traders of this
city' waited on the President of the United
States, and presented the following address
1 ligwed by about five hundred.
To the President of the United States :
The addrefaof the Merchants, Underwrit
ers and Traders of the city of "Philadelphia
RESPECTFULLY SHEWETH,
That the Merchants, Underwriters and
traders of Philadelphia, always joining with
t the general voice of thejr country,"far a
â¢ refloration of a good understanding with the
| French republic ; the interruption to which
f has been so fatal tp their interests, cannot
but expiefs their deep regret at the failure
, of the late attempt to negotiate with that
country.
: But while they manifeft their concern on
' this unfortunate occasion, they think it
their duty to teftify their perfedl fatisfadlion
with t'rie disposition you have evinced, and
3 the means you have employed, to effedt that
I defirahle objedt.
i It appears that notwithflanding the mod
5 conciliatory condudt on ysur part ; wanton
and unprovoked aggressions on our com
merce are still to be continued, from pride,
, haughtiness, and' a spirit. of domination,
which are llrengthened by the ill grounded
- persuasion, that the views of ourgovernuiÂ«nt j
' and its citizens are not the fame ; and that
hostility may be maintained against us with j
~ little other ride than that of exciting on our
, part a harmless enmitv or resentment.
, As Americans, jt iJ. us of the honor, and
* attached to the freedom of our country, we
c repel with indignation every attempt to fe- |
parate usfrom the government of ourchoice ; j
J and although we may differ in local politics I
or in our sentiments, as to particular mea- ;
fures ; yet we shall ahvayl unite in opposing
the attempts ef any foreign nation to dimin
ish our rights as an independent people.
Under the impulse of these sentiments we
, come forward to affupe yon that we are pre
pared to meet any state of fuffering to
which our commerce may be exposed, by
the event we deplore ; and that reding on
the wisdom and patriotism of the public
councils of our country, for that protedtion
which it in the power of the government
to afford ; we beg leave to assure you, Sir,
we fliall give our sincere and firm support to
s, the measures which may be adopted for the
'â¢ general welfare.
ANSWER.
To the Merchants, Underwriters, and Tra
ders, of the City of Philadelphia.
This patriotic Address, from an opulent
and powerful class of citizens, as it does
them honor, will give fatisfadlion to the go
vernment, and receive the applause of the
nation. In language the mod decent and
simple, it expresses the difintereded public
spirit, and determined resolution of Ameri
cans in the mod glorious, bccaufe the mod
\irtuous periods of our hidory. From me,
such sentiments demand my mod grateful
and unreserved acknowledgments.
I believe, I may with fafety appeal to
the good sense of the Merchants, Insurers
and Traders, not only of Philadelphia, but
throughout 'the United States, whether it
is in the power of any enemies we have, cr
it are likely to have, essentially to injure even
the commerce of this country, if protedted
by its own efforts, with such aids as are in
the power of the government to afford.
As in our natural career, there are me-
menti when iaadtivity is deftrudtive, so in
the political world, there ar: seasons when
- tranquility may be fatal.
If the sincere sentiments of my heart to
, wards France, which are now open before
the public, had met with a similar disposi
tion in the government of that country, we
fhonld dill have pursued our neutral, im
partial, and pacific course. But unhappi
ly, they have met with nothing that 1 can
discern, but a determined, thotigh insidi
ous spirit of hostility. The consequences
are not for me to anticipate.
Your assuranceS of support to the govern
[ ment, are very fatisfadtory, aad will be relied
â  on with entire confidence.
, JOHN ADAMS.
Philadclph a, April 17, 1798.
Yefterdav, the House of Reprefentativej of
the United States went intÂ» a committee of the
whole on the state of the Union, on the bill to
enable the President to procure cannon, arms
and ammunition, and for other purposes;
when, after considerable debate (a (ketch of
which, with the other proceedings of the fit
ting, will be given in a future paper) theblank
containing the sum for the purchase of can
non, finall arms, ammunition and military
Itores, was filled with eight hundred thouland
dollars, and. that for the hire, purchase and
employ of foundries and arrjjories, with one
hundred thousand dollars. The bill was gone
through, and ordered to be read a third time
to-morrow.
In the paragraph in yesterday's paper, dat
ing the business of Monday, for " companies,"
read battalions.
The Gallic Editor of the Aurora is known
to be in daily and secret conference with a
certain high officer in the Government, (in
famous for his foreign correjpondence.) It is
! supposed the fruits of this republican con
j naction will be thrown on the parish before
long, for public maintenance. The brat
; may gasp but it will surely die in the infamy
i of its parents.
MR. FEN NO,
Some musicians lad night and the evening
before, had the audacious impudence to re
fufe playing the President's March ; altho'
requeftcd by the box and the greater part 1
!of the house. I reprobate llrongly the ac
tion of pelting the musicians, but would
Inve preferred the firm and dignified conduct
of leaving the Theatre, and refnin goinir
thither til! the managers positively declared
the President's March should be for *he fu
ture the firft tune played ill the houseâand
further, give assurance that those gallic niur
der-fhouts, Ca Ira, Carmagnole and the
Marseilles Hymn, fliall no .%ore grate cur
ears. Â»
This may be called party spirit j and ex
ercising an undue influence in so public a
place as a Theatre. The firft assertion I
would admitâbut let us look into' the na
ture of it. Would an American be so base,
so degenerate as to refufe his hearty a dent
to any measure which would evince an at
tachment to his President and constitution ?
And is not the President's March general
ly e(teemed a token of federal spirit ?
With refpeft to influence, this is my
opinion-^-
I would not compel any one man or body
of men to adt contrary to their ftntimentsâ
but at this critical jundture of affairs when
our country is on the eve of a war with
Fraace, I believe it incumbent on every true
American to shew an utter contempt and
hatred (but in a decent way) for every mea
lure,Â»fong, or mod trifling action that bears
the lead tindture of French principles.âl
would blush for my country could I believe
that there exided even a weak ; rty of na
tive Americans who would oppu.e, even a
f;ng, or tune indicative of a federal zeal and
true conditutional spirit. I fay nativ: for
there are some Demi-Americans partly of
French extradtion who feel a natural partial
ity to the country of their forefathers j and
also some out and out Frenchmen who, burn
ing with all the fanatical fury blazing in
France, have migrated here to heat the cool
and temperate spirit of Americans with
that fire which has consumed their own na-
I tion.
j Those pre the men who would cut the
i cords of our political union, fever the
j people from th. ir government and pull down
| that monument of American genius the
j Federal Conflitution.
I Such men should be discountenanced and
j sent home not only branded with the seal of
infamy but scourged with the Rod of Chas
tisement. LUCIUS.

ExtraS of a letter from Norfolk to a gentle
maif in this city, dated April 8.
" You have doub less heard of the Spa
nish fleet being out. Copies of lo<-d St- Vin
cent's dispatches Parker in the
Wed Indies are in town. The Spaniardshad
19 and lord St. Vincent 22 fail of the line
â5 fail and 60 merchaÃt3 (hips had gone
011 for the Wed Indies ; the others, it is sup
posed, for Bred. The frigate whiÂ«h brought
the advices totheWed-Indies paffedthrough
the Spanish fleet. From what I can collect
the fleets were not more than from 10 to 15
leagues apart."
WORCESTER, April 4.
Mr. Thomas Stickney, Merchant, of
Brookfield, has invented a spring saddle,
for which he has received a patent from the
government of the United States. The
design of these saddles is, to counteradt the
motion, so as to make it less fatiguing to
the rider, and the weight less burdensome
to the horse.
We hear from Stilton, that on the 23d
ult. Mr. Ebenezer Boyce, with one of his
neighbours, was attempting to roll a log
upon two others, which were on a'fled, by
the help of oxen, when the chain broke,
and the low rolling back, knocked him
down, and, being borne up by the {kids,
passed his body but fell on his head, and
killed him in(tantly. He was the only son
of the widow Betsey Boyce, apromifing
young man, highly esteemed by his acquain
tance, aged 2 2 years.
