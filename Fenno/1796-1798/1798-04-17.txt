PHILADELPHIA,
TUESDA Y EVENING, Jprd 17.
COMMUNICATION,
A freb'e z'empf is made by (he Freer h party
to exnuj-rate their nutters the diredforial ufnrp
ers, from the imputation! of.rapacity ami ve
nality fixed cn them by the difciofure ni the
from our envoys. To decide this
qucftion, happily the dtfpaiches themselves are
fully competent. They go dire&lv to the point ;
ami leave no room for tergiverfatinri- " A per
foa who poflefles the confidence of the directo
ry n what relates to America," and who in af
terwards declared in presence of all the envoys,
to be " M. Talleyrand himfelf," proposes to
tlieni t. To ajrree to > mollification of the lan
guage rf President Adams, refpefling their out
rages against America. 1. To infti.ute a tribu
nal, after the model rontained in the 'Uritifh
treaty, to decide on spoliations, whose awards
when in favor of the American claimant, were
to be part by the American government J 3.
A loan by the United States to France, from
whi h was firft to be taken " certain I'u.ns" for
the " cvjlomary distribution in diplomatic af
fairs." In addition to the declaration of the
agent X. that Talleyrand made thnfcpropofi
tiont inronfidenr* of the direflory, othef con
fidera ions eqwally forcible operate in corrobo
ration. First, it is impoflible to fupjyde that
Talleyrand conld enter into such meafares in
dependent of the directory,without committing
htmfelf entirely to the power of the envoys,
w ho, by pxpofihg his infamous proportions to
them, might t!T<finally ruin him if they were so
pure and perfefl as our Jarobms reprt fen! tiiem.
Second. 1 he minister Talleyrand, being en
trusted by the direflory with the ccmduft of ne
gocia:icns, tlievare atifwersble for his aflions ;
and (he measures. of Talleyra'nd are the mea
fuÂ«e? of;he governments If there existed ground
to fuppofi that filch atrocious condifif, from be
ing rjre and ' ! nprecede';ted, as veil as unau
thorised, â¢< ould prove a fubjeifl of future exam
inatii *1 and procure the difmiflal o the agent,
there would then be some ground to go upon in
exonerating the directory. But p,ift experience
come in evidence of their familiarity with iiro
j!ar rrniluiTt. This fame Talleyrand, in on
uniiiin with this fame dira&ory, have alrea
dy c;rned on JimiJar practices with Portugal ;
and alter eMnrtlng enormous films from her as
the pi ice cf peace, have treicheroirfly vio ! a'tqd
their contract in the hope of wrefling fyrther
plunder. The money thus robbed from Por
tugal pafled immediately into the hands of the
direilory, and was -employed inbiisging the
army tf. Paris, to the subversion of the constitu
tion. the definition of the best men ill France,
ar.d the lanlefs usurpation of all the powers of
government. Talleyrand was not displaced for
thisâon the contrary, the direflory took part
with him in tke whole hufinefs.
Of this,no rational unprejudiced rmnean doub::
that' the corruption and rapicity of the present
men in power in France, is beyond all former
precedent. There cannot be a doubt that the
directory, though their caution and cunning led
them to keep in a great measure
were aiHually at the bottom of tht whole tranf
a<s\inn ; and as they were 'to have partaken of
the spoil wrung r rom our bleeding country, so
ought they to partake their fall share of the in
famy and wgrati .n dee to such
praiPiices.
For the Gazette of the United States.
No, 11.
As another fubjeft of complaint, or, as
another scheme to retard negociation and in
creafa animosity, an apology is demanded
for the President's speech.
The justice cf John Adams's refleftiotis
on the 16th of May, are so notorious, that
2 recantation of them, would make every
true American hang down his head. If
such a circumstance was to take place I (hould
turn from the wall tor every Frenchman I
ma. Every sansculotte would, like the
chiefs in Havanna expeft us to kneel at his
feet.
It may be ufeful, here, to introduce the
particular paragraphs of the President's
communication to Congress, which the di
rectory deem objeftionable.
i ft. " With this condnft of the French
govegiment it will be proper.to take into
view, the public audience, given to the
late minister of the United States on his
taking leave of the Executive Direftory.
The speech of the President,' discloses
sentiments more alarming than the re
fufal of a Minister, because more dangerous
to our independence and union, and at the
fame time ftudieiufly marked with indignities
against the government of the United States.
It evinces a disposition to separate the peo
ple of ( the United States from the govern
ment ; to pcrfuade thtm that they have dif
ferent affeftipns, principlesand interests from
those of their fellow-citizens, whom they
themselves havfe choftn to manage their com
mon concerns ; and thus to produce divi
sions fatal to our peace Such attempts
ought to be repelled with a dccifion, which
(hall convince France and the world, that
we are not a degraded people, humiliated
under a colonial sense of fear fitted to be
the miserable instruments of foreign influ
ence, and regardless of national honor, eha
rafter and'intereft."
2d. " The diplomatic interconrfe be
tween France and the United States being
at present suspended ; the government has
no means of obtaining official information
trom that country ; nevtrlhelefs there is rea
son to believe that the executive directory
pafled i decree on the 2d. of March last,
contravening in part the treaty of amity and
commerce of i"7Â®> injurious to our lawful
commerce, and endangering the lives of our
citizens. A copy of this decree will be
laid before yoti."
3d. " While we arc endeavoring to ad
just our differences with France, by amica
ble negociatiori, the prpgrefs of the war
in Europe, the depredations on our com
merce, the personal injuries of our citizens
and the general complexion of aflaii s render
it my i 'llifpeitfible duty to recommend to
your cocfidirratioo effectual tncafureo of tie- I
fence."
4'h- " It is impofiible to conceal from
oinfcKcs, or the aorW, what has been be.
obferveJ, that endeavors fiT.ve been
employed to fofter and eftabliih a divilion be
tween the government and the pepplc of the
United States. To irvedigste the causes
| which have encouraged this attempt is not
necefiary. But to repel, by decided and
united councils, iufinuations so derogatory
to the honor, and aggrefilons so dangerous
to the constitution, union,'and even inde
pendence of the nation is an iudifpenfable
duty."
| I will appeal to any man, who efteenfs
candor, justice or patriotic love, as virtues,
if there is an exprefiimn in the whole speech
| which was not warranted, which was not
commendable, from the contemplation of
the political piSure which that day present
ed : and from the natural anticipation of
the contents of the volume cf futurity,â
The French' are little inclined v> liilen to
denunciations againll them ; but " those
who walked in'darknefs" (hould hi made to
fee " light." It is the difnofition of the
worken of iniquity, inseparable from the
materialsof thtir minds, to h:<te the truth :
| hence, the offence taken at the Preiident's
i fentiments,âferitirnents which were
i and jullly occasioned, by the following ex
t tracts from the fuiforpe harangue delivered
j by Barras the d.'reftor, to minister Monroe,
j " Fiance, rich in her liberty, furround
-1 edby a croud of victories, strong in the es
teem of her "allies" (would they had cause
for edeem) " will not abase herfelf, bycal
culmmg the confeqtiencjs of the coidefcen
tion of the American government to the fug
geltions of her former tyrants." If any
i apologies are demaiidahle, has not America
a fight, to claim one for this ? That (he sub
mits to the fuggeftipns of Great Britain in
a fcrvileâcondeicending manner.
It ends not here,
" Moreover the French republic hopes,
that the successors of Columbus, Raleigh
and Penn, always proud of their liberty,
will never forget that they-owe it to â¢France."
O Barras! if death (hould not rid- thy
country of the cahmity thy existence cauf.
es, it may be cbligatrry to vacate thy
tÂ«rone, â¢'and seek i (helter in an humbler
(hed."
Fortune, who favor 3 the world, rather

(hould'ft thou rot as food for worms or,

We " will weigh in " eur " wisdom, the
magnanimous benevolence of she French

perfidious pcrfons, wl>o meditate btinging

The following 'fCoiti tof the celebration
by the French army in Holland, of that Ca
ll i bah c Ceremony, the commemmoration of
the murder of the unfortunate Louis, is
trarflated from the .Ley den Gazette of the
2<l of February.
" Head-Quarters, Hague,
The 6th year of the French Republic, one
and indivifiblg, the 2d Pluviofe, correspond
ing to the 2ill January (old style) the an
niveifary of the day when France beheld ty
ranny exphe with the last of its Kings, has
been celebrated after the following manner,
at the Head-Quarters of the French troops
1 at the Hague.
At noon, the Etat-Major-General, that
of the 2d divilion, the chiefs of the differ
ent administrations, the troops of the gar
rison of the Hague, and the Minister Ple
nipotentiary of the French Republic, hav
ing assembled at the Champ De Mars, a
salute from the artillery annorinced the com
mencement of the ceremony. The Minister
Plenipotentiary Charles Lacroix pro
nounced the followiug discourse.
" Five j-ears have rolled away finee the
day which saw fall, under the iron of nation
al justice, the head of he laft'and most per
fidious of our tyrants. That day has aven
ged fourteen ages of slavery, of debasement
and miifortune : It caused to (hine on the
French the fun of liberty, it dectrifed all
their hearts, warmed all their fouls, develo
ped all their talents. Since that day, for
ever memorable, how many triumphant
crowns have been girt round the head of the
Great Nation ! It is above all to you, ge
nerous warriors, that if is indebted for
this glory. Neither the lofty ridges of the
Alps, nor the foaming billows of the Rhine,
nor the icy mar(hes of Batavia, could arrest
your courage ; and soon the ocean (hall no
more prove but a feeble barrier to you.â
What powerful genius operated all these
prodigies, which have signalized the reign
of the conftitntion ? It is the hatred ofaÂ°i
archy, it is the horror of royalty, and of all
the tyrannies. The mcft atrocious remains,
that which burthens the fcas ; and you (hall
destroy that too : TheÃatavians, your bro
thers, disengaged from the snares which fe
deialifm imposes on theircourage; will (hew
themselves your worthy rivals ; and the two
republics, and Spain their ally, will owe to
the united efforts of their warriors, the hu
miliation of a proud enemy, the deftru&ion
of a perfidious enemy, a peace, glorious,
ufeful and durable. Let us preserve these
fcntiments forever, wbirff- constitute our
ftrepgth, the love of a wife liberty, the ha
tred of tyranny.; and upon this solemn day,
upon this beloved country, let us repeat
with emulation the oath wfiich the lawprc
fcribes for all Frenchmen.
" I swear hatred to royalty and tq anar
chy ; I swear attachment and fidelity to the
republic and to the caa dilution oi the 3d
year."
All mout'us repeated the oath ; and the
music executed the air Ca Ira. The gene
ral in chief Joubert, then harangu.d the
troops thus :
COMRADES,
There was a time when the Republic was

tiie KinÂ»s trifled with your courage ; Ai|
? Will i to seize tlitir fcu!s with terror, to ar-
I reft their audacious career, needs but one vi

cf kings had founded in France.
Sine* that memorable epoch, how have
our fucct ffesfurpatfed ourrevytfes ? It would
be tedious to enumerate them : It iÂ» left to
your proud imagination toretrace the events
which have succeeded the firft year of the

One Hep yet remains to be taken : The
Liberty of the Seas mud be your work.â
During the war oa the Continent, all eye*,
at that ft.lctnn period were fixed upon rivers

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, April ii .
MR. NEW asked and obtained leave of
absence for his Colleague Mr. Clop
jton, for three week's ; and another momber
was appointed in his place on the committee
of enrolment.
Mr. Gordon renewed his motion to
take off the injunftion of (ecrecy from the
members ef this house withrefpeft to the in
ftrutlions of the Executive to our Envoys to
the French Republic, and hoped the house
and galleries would be cleared of (Irangcrs for
the jmrpofe. â¢
Mr. Nicholas did not think it necefiary
to take up this bwliuefs. He (aw the instruc
tions were printed by the Senate, and laid on
their desks, and as the printers had inserted
the whole of the dispatches in one paper, he
supposed the inftruttions would be published
in the fame way, and if fa, there was no neces
sity for any farther publication of them.
The motion for taking up this matter was
put and negatived 33 fo^o.
Mr. Sew all laid before the house a letter
from the Secretary cf War, inclosing. certain
communications on the fubjeÂ£t-of the defence
of the country, which were referred' to the
committee of the whole on the (fate of the
union. â¢ â¢
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
claims, made an unfavourable report on the
petition of the widow of Jofiah Flagg, which
was concurred in by the house.
A meflage was received from the Senate,
informing the house that that they had patted
a bill fifr the relief of Joseph Nourfe, to whiti
they requeit concurrence; alfe the bill ma
king certain reimbursements to our Consuls
in foreign countries.
The house resolved itfelf into a committee
of the whole on the (late of the union, Mr.
Den t in the chair, for the purpose of taking
into consideration the bill supplementary to
the aÂ£t providing for the further defence of
the ports and harbours of the United States.
The chairman having gone through the bill,
and repeated she firft feftion, in which was a
blank for the sum to be appropriated,
Mr, S. Smith (aid, as the chairman of tire
committee whs reported the bill (Mr. Sewall)
was-not in his place, he lhoul,d propose to fill
the blank with 200,000 dollars. Whenfpeak
ing on this fubjett before lie had said that
| 150,000 dollars (and not 115,200, as he found
he had been understood to fay) had beenefti
mated as necefiary ; but in order to leave a
furpltis in the hands of the President, he be
lieved it would be proper to fill the blank
with the sum he had named. But as he now
iÂ«w the chairman in his place, he would pro
' biibly llate what the estimate was.
Mr. Sewall feeonded the motion for fill
ing the blank with 200,000 dollars. The esti
mate which the committee had made, he dated
to be as follow s :

In this film, Mr. S. said, wrre included se

and rhere will remain 145,000 to be provided

thority placed in the President, the committee
concluded to recommend an appropriation of

Mt. Ulount observed, that there was no

made for any fortifications in North-Carolina^
and from '.he proceedjrgs had in this business
heretofore, he was convinced of the propriety
of designating the different places at which
money liould be expended, and the amount
for each, confining the appropriation to such
as would be likely to answer some valuable
purpose. He therefore moved that the com
mittee rife, and if this motion was carried, he
Ihould then move to re-commit the"bi! for
the purpose of accomplilhing what lie had
mentioned.
Mr. Sew a Li. was proceeding to reply to
Mr. Blount, when the chairman Hopped him,
and fold, lie found that this bill had not been
referred to the committee of the whole on the
(late of the'union, but to an ordinary commit
tee of the whole.
A motion was accordingly made and car
ried for the corrtmittee to rife. The house
being reftifhed.,
Mr. SloWt'moved that the committee
of thcwhttle, tt> whom had been referred the
bill fupptefnen'tary to the aft providing for
the further defciice of the ports and harbours
of the WfffWd States, be discharged, and that
the brll be re-committed to the- felett com
mittee, to-be reported in the fpecific way in
which he had already -mentioned. .Formerly
when a bill of this kind was palled, an esti
mate limilair to the present was furnifhedj and
it was proposed so afortjat Ocracock in
Carolina, of'ejeht guns, and a sum of mo
â¢neyrwis appropriated accordingly. But it fort
of double this itteiigth was commenced, and
instead of a barrack tor 50 men, one was be
gun which would contain 503, so that the
whole sum of money appropriated was ex
pended informing the outlines o-t the work.
A fort of eigllt guns would answer a valuable
purpose at this place, and, as he did net ex
tent it would be attended to without it was ex
prefslv mentioned, he hoped bill would be
re-committed.
Mr. SEwALLfaid, the committee had at
tempted to form a bill in this way 5 bnt they
found io many difficulties in it, as to induce
them to adopt the present plan, and give the
Executive full dilcrefion in thisbiifinefs. If
the re was a wUnt of attention to any particular
plarr, on application tÂ« tlie President,- the de
feft would doubt'efs be remedied. It w'aa
iwipolTible to ascertain, without actual inspec
tion, what was necessary to be expended at
the different places ; it was therefore thought'*'
to be ber\ to leave the business with the Exe
cutive.
Mr. M'DowtlLWis in favourof the com
mittee being difchnrged, for the purpose
mentioned, fie thought it might be as well
â¢afcertuined from the members of: that house
what would be neceliary to complete the dif
ferent fortifications as in any other way. It
appeared extraordinary to him that N. Caro
lina had been wholly unattended to*
Mr. Otis thought it very improper for
members to come forward to point out to the
world the weak and nioft vulnerable parts of
the Union; he*"believed the business might
be fately trufled in the hands of the President.
If war were to take place, and the President
was to be reftrifled in the way proposed, after
the.money appropriated was expended, the
enemy would know he could go no further.
He could imagine a contingency to happen,
three weeks after Congress h&s risen, which
lhould make it necessary to expend all the
money appropriated at one place. The pre
sent-, he said, ought not to beconfidered mere
ly as the fortification of a peace e<labli(hment ;
but the President (liould have power to oppose
.danger wherever it may threaten. If the Hate
ot N. Carolina had been he had no
doubt,onapplication totlie President, it would
be attended to.
Mr.,Bsooits would just add, tha't they
'had 110 documents'to enable them td judge
what was heceflary to be done at different'
places. It was true the committee had made
an eliimate ; but it had been done without any
certainty. Nothing could be done without a,
â Purvey. The Executive would douhtlefs take
care to have this made, and do what was ne
cessary in the bulinefs.
Mr. S. Smith said the fubjeft had been
conlidered in the felecl committee upon the
-ground dated by the gentleman from North-
Carolin.i, and he was originally in favourof
this mode ; but, upon considering the fubjeft
he found it would be attended with many dif
ficulties, without producing all the benefits he
had contemplated, he therefore gave way.â
ihelaft fedion the Secretary of War made a
report, mentioning the different places at
which money <vas wanted to complete fortifi
cations, the whole amount of which was
200,000 dollars. New-York was omitted from
the edimate, and 145,000 dollars were appro
priated, Having got the money, it was to be
supposed the Secretary of War would havp
proceeded with the bulinefs; but a few of the
places had only been attended to, and very
trifling fuins expended. The reasons he gave
tor not having expended more were, that he
had a iked tor an additional regiment of artil
lery, whieh not bein* given, there would not
be fuincient men to place in them. How far
he Was right in afting thus, he mud himfel'f
answer. But it was proper, at a time when
war, if not unavoidable, is at lead very pro
bable, to place the power and refnonlibility
in the hands of the President, and leave it to
him to fee that the Secretary of War does his
duty. He was willing to give him 200,000
dollars for this purpole.
Mr. Venable thought the objeft of the
gentleman from N. Carolina might be anfwer
cd by designating the places at which money
should be expended, without mentioning the
Aim; leaving it to the President to expend
what fijras he thinks proper, and to fortify
such oth?r places as he may judge fccell'ary.
Mr. Baldwin laid, there waj not the lame
difficulty in the business of fortification now,
as wTien it was firft gotte into. At that 'time,
mar.y persons were of opinion with the chair
man of the present copimittee that the money
would be belt appropriated in gross â¢ .but it
was otherwife,
ers were sent to different parts of the I, T nited
States, tor thfl purpose of making surveys and
reports. In some places they recommended
permanent works, and in others works of a
less fubllantial kind. As these reports could
readily be referred to; except as to the new
fortifications pFopofed, it would, perhaps, be
bed to follow, tlie cotiHe heretofore taken, as
though it would.be attended with a little more
trouble, it would take a considerable burthen
from the Prelident. ;r
Mr. SeWall laid a few words in reply,
which were unfwerediby MÂ¥. Baldwin.
Mr. J. Williams was fully fatisfied the
bill otight not to be repommitted, for the rea
sons stated by the gentleman from Maryland
(Mr. S. Smith). The President wouid be
better able to learn where it would be proper
to lay out money on this subjeCt than that
' loule could ; for if they were to go into the
bufinefs,-one d-ate woujd wi(h this place to be
fortified, and another that; bin the President
would expend the money where it was really
wanted, and it the foiithern dates w*ere to be
threatened, it might be necessary to spend the
greatelt part of it there.
Mr. Macon wasin favourof the motion;
for if the different places were enumerated, he
(liould move to (hike out New-York, as it
had been shewn heretofore that the fortifies^ons which are erefting there will be ufclefs, 1
and that the money expended upon them will t
be thrown away. He was fuppprted in this 1
opinion also by the report of an engineer at the r
last feflion. c
Mr. Grove was for the committee's being (
discharged. It appeared to hint that the t
felefft committee had wanted information with \
rsfpett to from which he came, a
They had a coast of 400 miles, on which was (
much wealth, and on which were places of f
considerable consequence, particularly Wil- c
mington and Georgetown, which had not a 1
gun to protest them against any privateer that c
miaht comeagainfl them. The moneywhich 1
had already be?n expended was wholly use- <
less; and'if the people in, that quarter fee ]
Congress is determined <so do nothing i
them, they will be under ttfe njeceflity of do
ing something for themselves. He was afton- <
ifhed that 110 attention had been paid to this 1
coast, as an enemy inijfht.in two hours fail 1
from the ocean, and put arms into the hands 1
of at least 5000 men, vyho might be ready to
receive them. He could produce letters to
shew that the people In tljat quarter consider .
theaifelves in a very dangerous littiation. He
hoped therefore the bill wspld be recommit
ted, and that this part of the country would
be looked at. He was willing to vote for ev
ery measure of defence which might be tho't
neceffiry ; but he could not lit (ilsnt to fee
the Itate from whence he came wholly neglect
ed.
Mr. Livingston fuid, the reason which
the gentleman from Norch-Ciirolina (Mr. Ma
con) had afligned for wit'iing the bill to be re
committed, vizi that he might have an oppor
tunity of ftrkingr out the'port of New-York,
convinced hiifi of tha propriety of not recom
mitting it. fyjr. L. gave reafon3 why it was
proper to attend to the port of New-York.â
vVithrefpeCt tojthe groundaÃigned for a recom
mittal by the gentleman last up, he would
recollect that the feleft committee estimated
that there would be a balance of 55,00 a dol
lars, to expend on Inch placesas the President
fliould think proper; and if he., should be ap
plied to, {here could be no doubt but thecoalt
cf N. Carolina, which he hadfpoken of would
te attended to. If lli^committee were inpof
feilion of fufficient information for the purpose
he should himfelf be in favor of fpecific appro
priations ; but he was co.iviuced they were
note
Mr. Hartley was opaofed to the motion
for difcharginh the committee, as it would ne
atnended with a lofsof time, and caofeagreat
deal of unneceTary debale ; for as the gentle
ma'nfrom N. Carolina (Mr. Macon) isagamft
the whole bill, it might be supposed he would
bppofe every place that was mentioned for
fortification. He believed New-York oughtto
be attended to, and he doubted not the object
wi/hed by theoti.ergentlemanfromN.Carolina
(Mr, Grove) would b-effected by the present
bill. He thought it proper that discretion
should be left with the President in this bufi
nafs, as it might be necessary to erect forts at
places which were not at present contemplated
Mr. Brooks waiconvinced of theimpro
priejy of committing the bill from the reason
alTigned by His colleague. The bufmefs, he
said, would be belt lett with the President,
â who would cokiduct it withoutthofe local pre
judices which would not Otil to shew them
selves, if the members of that house were to
undertake to delignate the places.
Mr. Pinckney rose to juftify or excuse
the feledt committee for not having inserted
in their estimate that part of the coast which
had been fp. keh of by the gentlenan from N.
Carolina (Mr. Grove). It would be neces
sary to explain the views of the committee
011 that fubjeit The committee to whom
this fubjeit was referred, is not only a com
irritteefortaking into consideration fortifica
tions, but also the general defence of the Uni
ted States. They were not forgetful of that
part of the country which has been mention
ed ; but they did not think fortifications the
bed kind of defence for it. They contempla
ted the employment of gal lies on that coast,
which would be better calculated for de
fending it against privateers, than fortifications
would "be. * They thought fortifications use
less, except for the protection of large cities,
to preventthem from being bombarded or
laid under contribution ; but for the general
protection of the coast, a moving defence,
which is able to pass in (hallow water, will be
found much preferable.
With refpeft to New-York, he believed it
necessary to pay immediate attention to it.
Considerable sums had been expended 011 the
works there, and to leave them iH their pre
sent Itate, woL'ld only be to hold ojita lure to
anej-emy to take poflefiion of them and by
that means get command of one of the firft
cities in the union.
Asfo Ocracock, in North-Carolina, it may
be, and-lie doubted not it was a proper place
for a fortification ; but if gentlemen will con
sider that there is already an unexpended sum
of 90,000 dollars, part of which was appro
priated for that object, there is 110 necellity
for recommitting the bill to have that place
inserted.
The committee, he said, had reported a
proposition "for a Marine Defence, and a bill
lias been received from the Senate for the
fame objeÂ£t ; and they had no doubt but the
President would provide fortifications at fÂ«ch
Other places as might be thought proper,
which tlic committee had not included in their
cflimate.
Mr. Gamatin said, he did not under
stand that the motion of the gentleman from
North Carolina was intended to destroy the
bill, but merely that certain fpecilic appro
priations should be made, instead of leaving
the business altogether to the President. He
was himfelf in favour of this motion ; and he
was so becaiife he was in favour of the bill.
He wished money not only to.be appropriated,
but aftifally applied ; for experience had
tayght the house that when money wasappro
priated in the loose manner proposed by this
bill, it had not been expended. His idea
was that the money should be appropriated,
and that not only the President ftiould have
the power of applying it, but he directed to
fee that fticli and such places lje fortified, and
appropriate such and such sums for the pur
pose- In doing this, he did not wish to enu
merate arty more than the principal places
which had been named by the chairman of
the feleiit committee. In addition to this,
he wilhed a sum to be appropriated to be ex
pended on such ports as may not be mention
ed, but which it may hereafter be found ne
cessary by the President to fortify, or to make
good any deficiencies in the appropriations
which are fpecified. I,f the appropriations
â were not made in this Ipecific way, he a Iked
what security the house had that the objects
proposed would be accomplished > He be
lieved "they had none. The Secretary of War
told the house that the money appropriated
at tlje last feQjon was rot applied for two rea
sons ; one was, because Congress T.ad not
provided an regiment of artillery ?
the other was, bccaufc a condition had been
nade that the states should firft make ceflion
ef the iurifdiCtion of the ground whereon for
tifi< ations were erefted, and '.nat the cefhan
/ had not been made. The house has removed
die Lt;er obftack, though no additional artil
leryiiyet rftheb.ufinefj wasleftto
the difjretion of die fe< letaryof war, perhaps
he might at the next iclfion, aflign (omeother
reason for not having applied the money to the
objeftsfor which it wai appropriated. In the
prelent infiance he would be bold to fay that
the house had adted riv.ht, and the fecrctary of
war wrong. He last ftllion ivrjited an addition
al regiment of arrillery, which it was now
seen were not wanted ; whereas, if he hadex
pended the money as directed, our fortificati- i
ons would have been in a betterfituation than
they now are. Knowing this had been the
cafe heretofore, Mr. G. thoi i.t that the '
house, whose duty it was to provide for the j
defence of the country, ought not only to ap
propriate the money for the purpose, bitt di
rect it to be applied to particular objects.
Mr. G. was sorry to hear any local objefti
onS to thisbill. The gentleman from N- Ca
rolina had exprefled hisdelire to have the bill
recommitted, that he might have an oppor
tunity of flrikinjout New-York. To attain
this object a recommitment was not necessary,
It might be done by striking out the last fecti -
on of the bill. He mentioned thisbecaufc the
gentleman from'New-York had oppoi'ed the
recommitment on that ground.
As ail individual, it Was his opinion that
the (late of New j York ought to have ceded
the place on which her fortifications are ereÂ£U
(d, in the fame way as Pennsylvania and other
states had done ; he also thought that flatc
ought to have taken measures to have paid
the balance which they owe to the United
States. In both points he blamed them j but
in the present situation of the country, wishing
every vulnerable place to be fortified, and as
it was for the intceft and fafety of the union
that that port should be fortified, he certain
ly wished it to be attended to. He would go
as far as any gentleman in fortifying the ports
and harbours of the United States. He was
willing to appropriate 200,000 dollars for the
pijrpofe ; and he should be equally ready to
appropriate for providing filch gufl boats or
floatingbatteries as may be thought necessary
for the protection of the coast.
His colleague said he was opposed to the
recommitment, because it would occafionde
lay". He would remind him that that could
not be the cafe, as there were now in hand
90,000 dollars of an unexpended appropriati
on, and the commitment would not occaiion
a delay of more than a day or two.
fTt be conttnucd.J
Yeflerday, the Houle of Representatives of
the United States went into a committee of
the whole 011 the state of the union, on the bill
providing an additional regiment of artillery,
and engineers and the number of companies
to be raised was filled up with thiec and the
period for enlistment with five years, and a
difculfion took place which occupied molt of
the fitting, on a motion to limit tlie duration
of the law to two years. The motion was fi
nally negatived, 45 to 36. The debate on this
bill, together with other proceedings of the
fitting, fliall appear in a future paper.
Several petitions and resolutions were present

Fredericljburgy. April 12th, 1798.
Sir,
No man, T can allure you, feels more in
tereiled in the honor and happisefs of our
coun ry, than I do ; what m*fl be my con
cern then, to fee it agitated by parties,
which, if they do not subside, will over
whelm in common ruin, our government,
our Con fti tut ion, our liberties, in short, eve
ry thing, that is mofl dear to us and our
posterity ? There is, I fear, more than a
party, there is a Faction, again ft government
j and the union, which, seems to have taken
j this determination, " to prostrate *>ur inde
' pendence at the feet of France, and fubfti
i tute to theprefent established order of things
' a tyrannous anarchy, sooner, than defend
j America by the powers and faculties ftie can
â  call forth against this ofFenfive nation (which
. has already, nay for years, waged war a
-1 gainll the United States) as eventually, de
{ fenfive operations may draw our ir.terefts
5 i into closer conneftion with, those of En
' i glond." We are warranted in the entertain
ment of tkis opinion from the conduft held
by a certain set of men, for the last five
years; from the period of president Wash
ington's proclamation of neutrality to the
I present time. Had they been bribed by
. France, which is not supposed, (for why
hold out pecuniary inducements to those
who are volunteers in the cause ?) they could
not have afted for their retainers, againfl their
country w'.th a more hasty zeal ; a zeal,
which (too ready and fpontaneoils to await
the advances of corruption, but) springing
into aftion with a groupe of passions restless
and malignant", owes its life and being to
infernal agency aloneâOrder, law, -dnere
' fpeÂ£t to those, who are fct in airfhority over
us, it rarely inculcated ; and our public
prints, too seldom, explain upon the con
i dust of those, who ryerit popular reproba
tion : all address and aftiyitj;âare on the
other fide ; and the passions are pre-engaged
by bll those artificrs, which are calculated
to work on the mass of vulgar ignorance.
Not one in an hundred of our citizens, who
lives out of cities and towns tver reads a
Philadelphia paper, or a debate in Congress :
they kuow no more of the doings of their
reprefentalives, from these vehicles of in
telligence, than if they were [written [in a
1 1 foreign language. Men credulous and ill
5 informed arc fit materials to be worked on
by thofr who Jtave once gained their confi
, dence ; they yield like potter's clay to the
s k.and of the artificer ; and take whatever
- (hape he designs to give them : with little
- knowledge,little art, and such opportunities
