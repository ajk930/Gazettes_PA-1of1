CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, June 15.
Debate on the bill supplementary to and to
amend the entitled an a6l authorising the
Prelident of the Unitei States lo raise a pro
vilional army.
( Concluded from our lafl.)
Mr. S. Smith observed, that gentlemen
in iupport of this motion said, that the volun
teers ought to be favoured, because they
clothe and equip thpmfelves at their own ex
pence ; and do not, asked Mr S. the militia
the fame ? But is it a fact that the volunteers
arm themselves ? No ; the house has agreed
to lend'them arms, ' and after the power to
lend has been given, he apprehended few
would be bought. What would the great
body of the militia fay, provided the pnefent
motion were to pass ? T hey would (ay, "we
ate obliged to answer any call which may be
made upon us ; but tliefe volunteers whom
you have taken from our body, an 4 to whom
you have given arms, remain at home."â
Would not this offend the great body of mili
tia ? It certainly would. Besides, would
any military man take command of a body of
troops, who, when they came to a certair\
line might lay down their arms, and refufe
with impunity to march any farther ? They
certainly would not, as such a circitmflance
might occasion the most feriousconfequences ;
for it would be recollected, that during the
war, men who were engaged for tix months
only went off on the very day their time ex
pired, and on which an aClion took place,
which eccafioned a defeat of the American
Army.
But the lommittr-e were told by the gentle
man from Delaware (Mr. Ba yard) that ex
cept this motion was agreed to, we fliould
have no volunteers, or at least very few. If
so, we had better have none. It thefeyoung
men wilh only to fight by their own fire-fides,
they had better remain with the militia, and
go into the ranks with older men. It would
not be worth while to form a separate corps
of them. Indeed, if he had a son that would
enter into such a corps, he should be ashamed
of and he would disinherit him, and he
was persuaded that the young men of Ame
rica would not thank gentlemen for placing
them in such a situation as was propoled. If
they wished to place them in a ridiculous point
of view, or to procure for them the name of
the Silk Stocking Company, or any other term
of deriflon, they could not take a more effec
tual course to obtain it. He hoped, there
fore, thispropofition would not be agreed to.
Mr. BRooks did not view the clause under
consideration in so exceptionable a point of
view as his friend from Maryland, or he
would not vote for it. He knew that a pro
vision similar to this made a part of the former
bill. How it came to be (truck out, he could
not tell ; but he believed it was done without
debate.
Gentlemen spoke of the favourable situation
in which these volunteers will be placed, if
this ptoviflon is agreed to ; but they do not
weigh the matter on hotlx fides. They forget
that the mi\itia cannot be called into service
for a longer term than three months at a time,
and it was never known that militia were cal
led very far from home. The idea of march
ing these volunteers from one part of the i
United States to the other, was rather ima- J
ginary than real. In the course of last war, j
the militia was scarcely evercalled beyond the j
bounds of an adjoining slate ; but he had no
doubt if the service of their country should 1
stand in need of; these voung men, they would ;
not fuffer their ardour to be overcome by an \
ideal line. He believed these young men
would prove better troops than any other, and j
perhaps prevent the netellity of railing any
other.
The gentleman from Maryland has said,
that if he-had a son who would enter into a
corps under such a refiriction as this, he would
dilown him. Other gentlemen would bÂ£
equally concerned with him, if the;r sons
weie to take advantage of such a clause in
time ofdanger. But he did not think it vv ould
be right to terrify young men from the service
by holding up more l'evere duty for them
than it would be likely they would ever,t>Â«
called to perform. He hoped, therefore, the
amendment would be; i,'ced to.
Mr. Mi l;ledgÂ£ ia* , if this provision was
agreed to, the State of Georgia could only
expect Stfliftanc-e from the volunteers of one
State ; and the exposed situation of that State
is well known. The United States ought cer
tainly to be protected in.eveiy part ; and m
the lafl war it was usual for the flower of the
American people to fly to the mod extreme
parts of the Union whenever danger appeared.
Mr- Otis did not believe that any provi- I
fion could be thought of which could be
more effectual in discouraging these volun
tary aiTociations than a provision oi'this kind.
His friend from Delaware spoke of these young
men as if they were to be singled out for dil
tant service in preference to any other tropps,
and he was afraid such a fuggeflion and a mo
tion like the present, might have an undue ef
fect out of doors âFor though he believed
there are a great number of young men ready
to come forward, he believed the adoption of
this motion would prevent them f om doing;
so. We rose, therefore, to remind the commit
tee that the volunteers have no reason to be
lieve they will ever be called upon to go up
on any distant service, except in such cases as
would induce them to it whether they were
volunteers, or not.
As to the idea of these Volunteers fuper
ceding the necefiity of regular troops, he had
no such opinion. He believed that neither
Volunteers nor Militia would be a fufficient
defence without regular troops; and as there
had been no instance in the lafl war in which
the Militia had been sent to any great diffance
from home, he thought it could not be rea
fonablv expedled that these Young Men
would be very soon sent from their own
homes. But if this provision was agreed to,
he was afraid other arguments would be made
ufeof, rather to discourage than favour these
efiablifhments. Inflead of evincing any extra
ordinary degree of spirit and bravery, it would
be said their object was to*ftay at homeâthey
would be called The Silk Stocking Corfis ; the
Invalids i @c.
But it was said, except this clause was a
greed to, no Volunteers would enter the ser
vice. He had not been out of the city; but
he had the pleasure to fee every morning,
from 5 to4oo youngmen exercsfingthemfelves
in military difcipUne. He also law troops of;
['Volume XIV.
horse going through their evolutions. He be
lieved a timilar spirit exilted al/'o in N. York,
ind other large towns, and he trusted, there
fore, that the opinion of his friend from Dela
ware would prove to have been unfounded.
The question w;s put and negatived, therÂ«
being only 19 votes in favour of it.
Mr. Dayton moved lo amend the bill by
adding the word " legions", which was
greed to.
The committee then rose, and the House
havingagreed te the amendmsnts reported;
Mr. Sewall renewed his motion of art
additional fettion, authorizing the President
of the United States immediately to aopoint
fucb officers as he (hall think neceflary for the
better railing of the provisional army, when
ever he (hall think it neceflary.
1 he motion was taken by yeas and nays,
ar.d carried 42 to 39. (The yeas and nays
w ere given in our paper of June 16.)
Mr. S. Smith thenrenewed his motion for
flriking out Certain words, in order to confine
the loan cf arms to pieces of artillery alone.
His opinion was that (mail arms ought not
to be lent to the Volunteers. He thought
them much better able to purchase arms than
the Militia ; and if it was determined to lend
them, the probability would be that none
would be bought.
Mr. Brooks observed, the Volunteers
could not purchase arms until they are to be
fold ; and he believed government had arms
which they could iend, but which they had
no authority to fell.
Mi. Otis laid, if the gentleman from N.
York could dumorillrate the fait, that govern
ment has guns to lend and not to (ell, it would
have some weight upon his vote ; or if arms
could be bought, he Ihould certainly be in fa
vour of the motion of the gentleman froln
Maryland, as he did not think these volurt
teers ought 10 be excused from burdens laid
upon the Militia.
Mr. Brooks had no doubt of the faft.
Mr. Sitgreaves observed that a princi
ple had been alTumed by gentlemen on all
(ides, which he thought it important to be ex -
posed, and which ought to be abandoned.ââ¢
Gentlemen seem to think there would be no
propriety in extending to these corps exemp
tions which are not alio given to the Militia.
It isfaid, they are on no better footing than
| the Militia, and that they ought, therefore,
I tobuy theirown arms. He believed the irue
policy of this country lay on the other fide.
vVhilft we are endeavouring to organize the
i yquth and aftive citizens of the country, lit
! order to be ready to render service to their
country at the firft call, without regard to
place, or limitation of service ; when making
this invitation, Congrefsoughtcertainly to en
courage it by all the motives which can be
given; and if Congrefscan, by lending these
Young Men arms, induce them to turn out,
they ought to do it'; or, if there be any other
way of attaining the end, it ought to be taken.
Gentlemen (peak on this occasion, as if
there were no probability of having any Vo
lunteers, other than Young Men of property,
such as are generally seen aflociating in Phila
delphia and New York. He hoped the fame
enthusiasm which had fired the young men of
the cities, would also reach the young men in
the country, and that we (hould, in confe
queuce, have volunteers in agricultural, as
well as commercial \ii(triÂ£ls; and in thofedif,
trifts, itmufl be known, .that if public'aid is
not given, arms of uniform bore and size can
not be got.
These Volunteers, Mr. S. said, undertake
greater service than the Militia ; theirengage
ments are of a superior kind, and, in order to
induce young men generally to enter into/hefe
corps, every proper encouragement ought to
be held out to them.
Mr. R. Williams said, it appeared tm
him that gentlemen very much abandoned ttie
ground which they originally took. The lioufe
were told when the fubjed of Volunteers was
firft under consideration, that these youths
would produce a very formidable defence for
the United States, without coll. until they
came into aftual service. The r e were reasons
urged in favour of'them, 'when gentlemen
spoke of the Militia as being the natural and
heft defence of the country ; but now gentle
men propose for them one privilege after an
other. It was said, at that tine, that the rais
ing of these corps would not injure the Mili
tia, because they would be liable to do much
m6re duty, and be at greater ex pences, and
that nothing but love of country, could in
duce young men thus to ceme forward. But
now, and on former occalions, attempts have
been made to obtain regulations in their fa
vour. They had hitherto been refilled, .-Mid
he trusted they would-be so, for if ever mate
rial distinctions were made betwixt these corps
and the militia, they would produce nothihg
butdifcontent. W lull} the duty bears equally
upon the people, they will never complainâ
thev will do the duty they are called upon to
perform; but, whenever advantages are giv
en to one class qf citizens more than to ano
ther, diflatisfadtions and cdtnplaint lare the
immediate consequences.
What are the Militia obliged to do f They
are compelled to provide their'owi\arafs, and
to be fubjeft to the call of government upon
any fervrce upon which they may think it ne
ceirary to engage them. If is true, that the
Volunteers maybe called into service for a
longer period at a time ; bat that was a con
dition of their engagement with which they
were acquainted at the time. But here is a
proposition to loan them arms ; and he was of
opinion this circumttance might induce many
men to join these corps, rather than the M li
tis, w here they would have to purchase th<J : r
own arms, lfgovernment have/ ndtthe arriT*
to fell at present, as had been suggested, but
that they might loan them,.why not put the
provifioir upon that ground, and (ay the arms
(hall be loaned until they can be got for sale
to tliem. To such a provision he (hould no
object. The gentleman last up had said, ,the
volunteers ought to have a preference given
them, but he thought not. He (uppofes that
the enihufiafm which is at present so prevalent
in the cities, will spread to the country. Mr.
W. wilhed it might; but if it did, could tjiÂ«
gentleman suppose that, there are arms enow
in the public arsenals to lend to these youths
throughout the country ? If not, these pcrlons
being excused trom militia duty, will be ex
cused from all military duty whatsoever. Be
sides, if the United States were to find arms
forall these volunteers, he wiihei gentlemen
to recollett.how serious a fujn it would cpft.
He hoped, therefore, the loan of arms would
be confined to field pieces.
Mr. Edmond observed the gentleman
from N. Carolina Jail up had said he was op
pffed to definitions, yet he lim advoiitpdanamendment which will go to create them.
Tlus| morning a bill i.act oeen palfed for sup
plying the -Militia with arms, and if neither
the State Governments, nor individuals, will
ptirchafe them, they are to be loaned to the
peopJe. He himfelf oppofrd that measure,
because he believed it would discourage per
sons from purchasing arms, when they had a
profpecl ot borrowing them, though he be
lieved the gentleman from N. Carolina was
in favour of it.
The Volunteers (land upon a very different
ground from that 011 which the original bill
proposed toplacethem. Itwas there proposed
that they (hould not go beyond the limits ofan
adjoining (fate And in that cafe multitudes
would have come forward, provided they
fhouid not be called to serve as a Standing
Army, whilst their familieswere left destitute.
Men might then have been tempted to have
left the Militia, in order to have joined these
corps ; but if Congrcfs goes so tar as to fay
they will depend solely for the defence of the_
cou'ntry upon the ardour and patriotism ot
these young men, what will these gentlemen
fay > Each will fay to himfelf. " 1 am now
exempt from military duty, there is no law to
compel me to it ; but if 1 go into these Volun
teer Corps, I must. equip and arm inyfelf; I
may Ire marched to the extreme parts of the
Union, and not return for two years. If Ido
not join tbiscorps, 1 can (lay at home, and
when called upon, do Militia duty with my
neighbours. u âWher#, then, he asked, was
the inducement tobecomeVolunteers ? There
is none, and :t canohly be a pure tenement of
Patriotism which could induce Young Men
to enter these corps. He hoped, therefore, the 1
law would not be trammelled, but that the .
encouragement held out by this clause would,
at lealt, be agreed to ; especially as men ;
beyond the age of 45>, who are excused from I
Militia duty, miglu join these corps. 1
Mr. S. Smith laid the arguments of the
gentleman lad up g e to this, that there are l
no arms to be bought. His amendment said 1
no such thing. He wished the volunteers to (
ptirchafe their arms at once. If the gentleman 1
from Connecticut could Ihtw, that the govern- 1
mem could loan arms, but could not fell ]
them, his arguments would have some weight, t
With refpett to the bill parted thismorning, <
it did not originally contemplate any loan of (
arms ; but amendment had been intro- i
duced into it, providing that in cafe of any I
emergency, and any of the arms (hall remain |
unfold, they lhall be loaned to such persons (
as may stand in need of them. I
Supposing that 500 c stand of arms were on- <
ly to be lent to these Volunteers, it would ]
create a dtaft on the Treasury for 80,000 dol- 1 1
lars, and he thought it would be much better (
to fuffer individuals, who would generally be i
very able to dr* it, each of them to pay 14 of j
16 dollars for their own. |;
Mr. Dana fuppofed,as a military man, the < (
gentleman from Maryland, would admit the j 1
propriety of retaining a considerable quantity 1 1
ef arms in the arsenals of the United States.
Would it not, then, be folly and madness to ;
fell all the arms out of the Arsenals of the 1
United States > Ought we not to have fuffi
cient for an army, in cafe of invalion ( Ad- 1
mitring we have only this quantity at present,
if we loan them', and take receipts for them
from confidential officers, they might be at
any time returned in better condition, proba
bly, than they were lent, so that no expence
would be incurred. And these arms cannot be
purchased of a proper calibre any where elle.
And what was the amount, Mr. D. a(ked,
of the elegant harangue ot ihe gentleman
from N. Carolina, on the odioufnefs of dis
tinctions. Does he mean to fay there ought
to be no diftinttions in the community f
When men arediftingu-ilhed by theirb'-irthens,
ought they not to be diftinguiftied also by
their privileges.
The Yeas and Nays were called and taken
k (as given in aformerpaper.) The qtieftionon
the intendment was negatived 46 to 35.
The bill was then ordered to be read a third
time to mqrrow.
Mr. H'arfer called up the two resoluti
ons which he yellerday laid upon the table ;
the one for appropriating a sum of money for
the support of the new regiment of Artillery
for this year; and the other to authorize the
President to borrow a sum of money for .the
service of Government for the current year,
which were agreed to.
Mt. Van Alen asked and obtained leave

PHILADELPHIA,
MONDAY EVENING, Juir 9.
CONGRESS.
The House ofÃeprefenratives of the Unit
ed States, on Saturday, went into a committee
of the whole on the bill to augment the army
of the United States, and for other purposes.
This bill provides that each regiment of in
fantry (hall in future conlift of 600 privates,
and the proper officers, and that twelve addi
tional regiments of Infantry and fix troops of
Light Dragoons lhall be enlisted for and dur
ing the continuance of theexifting differences
between the United States and., the French
Republic. The pay of the privates in the army
ofthe Uniteii States is, by this bill, increas
ed from tour to fix dollarÂ» a month; sergeants
and senior mulicians to eight; corporals and
musicians to seven dollars ; and artificers to
the infantry and artillery, Sind farriers ar.d fad
[ dlers to the dragoons are to receive ten dol -
lars a month. This increase of pay is to take
place on the ift of August next.
Mr. Harper m ved an increase of pay to
Captains and Subalterns, which was negativ
ed, there being only four votes for it. *
Mr. Allen moved an amendment propos
ing that the additional men proposed to be
railed, (hall be raised by the several (tates,ac
cording to their population; but this motion
did not meet with a second.
Mr. Nicholas mbved to reduce the 11
additional regiments of infantry proposed to
be raised to eight ; which was negatived 43
to 19.
Mr. Kittera wilhed to amend that part
of the bill which fixes the period of the enlist
ment of the men, to-read in this manner : for
and during the existing differences between the
U. States and France and her pojjcjjtons. His
reasons were, that in cafe the government of
France (hould be changed from a Republic
to a Monarchy, Military Despotism, Ariltp
eracy, or any other form, before the conclu
sion of ourdifpute ; it might be doubtful, as
it now stood, whether the service of these men
(hould then cease ; and he wilhed if our dis
pute with France was fettled, and we (hould
still be at war with her poffellions in the Weft
Indies,* New Orleans or' Florida: (supposing
Spain to have ceded the latter places to
France) that these mepilbould not leave the
service, until our dispute with these powers
(hould alio be fettled.
On Mr. Gallatin's faying he could not
lee how we could be at peace with Frauce, and
at ivar with her poflefilons, the mover con
sented to strike out her possessions; and the o
ther part of the amendment was negatived 46
to 26.
The house palled the bill making a farther
appropriation of 600,000 dollars for the addi
tional naval armament, 54 votes being for it.
The Senate informed the House, they had
agreed to the amendments ot the House of
Representatives to the bill declaring the trea
ties heretofore concluded with France no lon
ger obligatory on the United States; and be
fore the House rose, the President of the Uni
ted States informed the House, that he had
approved and signed that ail; also the aft re
fpetting Alien Enemies; and the ail provid
ing arms for the militia ofthe U. States.
The following resolution has been unani.
moufly adopted by the Legislature of Mas
sachusetts at their late leffion ; and* an a
roendment to the constitution ofthe United
States in contormity thereto, has been pro
pof- d in Congrefj and will be taken into
consideration at their next fefSon.
WHEREAS it is highly expedient that
every cOnstitutional barrier fhouid be oppo
sed to the introduction of foreign influence
into our national councils, and that the
constitution of the United State! fhouid be
so amended, as to etfe& and secure in the
best manner the great objed for which it
was (lefigned :
Refoived, That the Senators and Repre
sentatives of this commonwealthin the Con
gref6 ot the United States be, and they are
he thy requested to use their best endeavors
that Congrcfs propose to the legislature* of
the fi-veral states the following amendment
to the constitution of the United States, viz.
" That (in addition to the other qualificati
ons prescribed by said constitution) no per
son lhall be eligiole aj President or Vice-pre
sident of the United States, nor shall any
person be a Senator or Representative in the
Congrcfs of the United States, except a
natural born citizen* or unless he shall have
been a refldent in tHe United States at the
lime of the Declaration of Independence,
and lhall h ve continued either to reside
within the fame or to be employed in its
service from that period to the time ef his
eleftion."

Forty-eight persons having signed the

our officers shall be duly appointed and
commiflioned, and that the afTociators be
fubjefiied to neceflary rules and regulations :
, And whereas the defence of our country
I mull, under God, depend on the virtue,
firmnefs and patriotism of its citizens: And
whereas we, the said aflociators, are desirous
, of manifefting our zeal in the cause of our
conntry at this critical and threatning crisis;
- and are willing to hazard our lives in sup
" port of the freedom and independence of
the United States, its constitution, laws,
and government, and considering the pre
sent defencelefs state of the city and port:
We do ref'jhte, That we will tender our
services to the United States, agreeably to
the aft of Congress to raise a provisional
. army ; and if the tender be accepted of by
the President, that application ought to be
made for ordnance, arms and (lores com- j

BALTIMORE, July 5.
*" Let Independence be our Boast"
If in the annals of the world, there ever was
an sera worthy of being immortalized by the
pen of the hiflorian âhanded down through
end'.efs generation as a glorious example to eve
ry insulted, wronged and opprelTed countryâor
as a warning to nations whose power is their
sole rule of rightâand deserving of being rank
ed among tht political feftivals of the worldâ
that sera is the Anniversary of the American
Independence. .
There cannot be, and there was not one real
American, but felt yesterday, in its full force,
the enthusiastic fire of genuine patriotilm ; and
we are happy to fay, that valuing the honor,
liberty and independence of their country, in
proportion as the danger of' losing them becomes
greater, the citizens of Federal Baltimore cele
brated the aufpiciou9 day with greater demon
strations of patr otifm, feftivity and joy, than
was ever witnelTed on any former occalion.
Ere the grey mantle of morn was withdrawn,
our eager citizen foldiera were roused from their
flumher, and the found of the trumpet and the
drum fummonedtheni to [he jubilee. The dif
ferent military corps assembled early on their re
fpeiftive parade grounds, and about eight o'clock
formed brigade, confiding of thÂ« fifth, sixth
and twenty-seventh regiments, and marched to
the review ground, on Federal Hill. Brigadier
general Swan was absent from town, and col.
Strieker .lifted as commanding officer of the day,
to whom much praise is due, for hi 6 care of the
health and convenience of the men.
After reaching the hill, the troops were form
ed in a line, and performed their exercise much
to the litis fail ion of the greated concourse of
citizens ever assembled on a similar eccafion, a
mong whom there was a great colleiftion of
ladies. 1 here was no small number of
pretty young {men, too, who, the ladies are
of opinion, would have appeared to much great
er advantage in the ranks, than as idle fpefta
tors of men whom they envied, without the spi
rit to imitate. -
About eleven o'clock the troops returned to
town, and having drawn up in Market-flreet,
fiied a feu-de-joie, and were difmificd.
On no occasion did the volunter companies
m?kefo numerous and brilliant an appearance,
which we hope will dill be kept up, though the
Fourth of July be palled.
The Observatory was dreded out with unu
sual gaynefaand splendor, in honor of the day :
and Gray's gardens were croudcd, to overflow
ing, in the evening^
To celebrate tlip anniversary of American In
dependence, the city company, commanded by
captain Harris, csmpofed of feme of the moil
refpe<fUbfe and venerable of our citizens, as
sembled at Mr. Bryden's inri, and during the
dinner were honored with the company of gen.
Stone, president of the Cincinnati of this state*
and other members of that patriotic i'ociety ;
when the following toasts, expreflive of the sen
timentÂ» of the corps refpedling pubHe charaders
and public measures, were given with general
and heartfelt fatisfadlion.

NEW-YORK, July 7.
By the arrival of the Draper, Capt. Collins,
we have received Irish papers to May 12,
from which we give the following ex
tracts :
LONDON, May I.
Yesterday accounts were received in town
from Vienna to the following effeft, aud
which may be perse ctly relied jm :
General Bernadotte, the French ambassa
dor at Vienna, had for some time pall con
duced himfelf in a manner which had given
great offence to the people of that city.â
He at le gth, one evening, hoisted the tri
coloured flag in the front of his hotel. The
commissary of the diltrift lent to remon
strate with him upon the proceeding, but
Bernadotte paid no attention to t(ie message
of the commissary. A mob soon assembled
round the hotel, tore down the flag, broke
the windows of the hotel, and drew two
carriages of the ambassador into the street,
which they broke in pieces. Bernadotte,
exasperated at theft proceedings, had, be
fore these advice left Vienna, given notice
to the court of his determination to quit
that place, and repair immediately to Paris,
for the purpose of laying his complaint be
fore the Directory.
May 2.
The difturbarice at Vienna having, in the
present crisis, much agitated the public
mind, we are happy to add the following
extraft from another letter relative to that
event, dated April 14,
" Count Ptrgen, minister of state and
general police, has issued the following pro
clamation, refpefting the affray w'>ich yes
terday took place in', and before the French
ambassador's palace. s
" His majesty the emperor has received,
with the utmost fatisfaftion, the various
proofs of loyalty and attachment, manifefted
by the good citizens of this metropolis on
so many occalions fitice his acccfiion to the
throne ; and these proofs are the more
pleasing to his paternal feelings, as they
were always attended with love of order,,
propriety of conduÂ£t, and a peaceful de
meanor, For the firll time, his- majesty
learned yesterday, to his great displeasure,
that some inhabitants of this capital, devi
ating from the path of lawful order, and led!
astray by an ill-judged zeal, allowed themw
selves to commit several afis of vio'ence inÂ»
the house 6f the French ambassador, and tÂ»
. disturb the public tranquility and peace.
His majelty expeÂ£b. that from this moment
no well disposed citizen, either direftly or
indireftly, will encourage any farther assem
blage, but on the contrary, will exert him
felf to the utmost extent of his abilities, to
restore order and tranquility. But if, con
trary to his expeiftation, any inhabitant of
this city (hould attempt again to disturb
the peace of their fellow citizens, the fame
' (hall be prosecuted and punilhed according
' to the utmost rigoV of the law."
. Seven hundred and eighty vessels, capable
( of carrying' one hundred men each, one
cannon, and drawing not more than 18
inches of water, are stated to be building
between Calais and the Tsxel,and are to be
ready in three weeks.
The Directory, it would appear, wifli to
avoid committing themselves upon the bufi
. ness at Vienna, until they {hall have had
, more time to deliberate ;,for the Reda&cue
t, is fi'eut refpeftiog the official steps thathave been taken in eonfequence of the as- j
fair, and the unofficial Journals only have i
yet been resorted to, for the pwrpufe of
proclaiming to France the lively sorrow of
the court of VieÂ»na, in consequence of a
lawUfs a 4 of the mobility, which it alto- i
gether disavows !
A circumstance likely to produce more I
feri.>us consequences than the preceding,'is i
the dmh of Jean Bon St. Andre, who has <
been decapitated by the Dey of Algiers, re- <
gardlefs of the vengea -ct that might be ex
pf ded to be attempted by the Great Nation, i
for fucli an aft committed on the person of a
one of its accredited agents ! We are not I
I informed of the circumstances that led to j
this catastrophe ; but, (hould it be confirm. f
ed, wc would not be surprized (hould the >â  J
learned expedition, prepared for Egypt be ; (
ordered to pay the Dey a visit in its pafiage f
ftierely to give him a iittle schooling on the c
refped due to strangers.
A letter from Raftadt of the 2id of A- ' v
pril, Hates, that on the Bth a treaty of of- 1
fenfive and defeniive alliance was con- : a
eluded and signed between the Empe- a
ror arid the King of Prussia. It is not, t
ho ' evt-r, conceived that this alliance has a
for its objed the renewal of a continental i
war. Its on!* objed is to concert measures
rtfpeding the indemnities to be required by fl
the two Courts of Germany, an Ito oppose c
wi h combined frrct the prcpagatfon of re- fl
publican principles on the left bank of the J
Rhine, and left of Germany. It is also I
stated that general Harry's army ha pafled fl
over to the right bank of the Rhine, and that o
the Prufiians and Heffiarwhaveiikewifemade q
fevetal military movements.
The French general who commands in the
ffland of Corsica, hasiflbed a p oelamation,
dating that the squadron aflembled at that e
vfland has Liled for the purpose of co-ope- r
rating in the expedition agai.ft England.
Wt(Star) have already stated our opinion v
that the late tumultuous attack made by 1
the populace of Vienna upon the residence d
of the French miniller would not produce o
any serious rup ure between Austria and f
the Diredory, as Germany, tho' humbled r
by the Lite events or hostilities, was still in a
a very different situation from that in which b
the Pope was, when they fought a casfe of h
quarrel with him. We stated .hat a difpofi- f,
tion to receive and give explanation would pro- h
babty ll* manifeiled, rather than to appeal 1
Co arms ; and the French journals, which n
we have this day received by express, up to (
to the iftinft. inclusive, seem to eftablilh a
the solidity of our eonjedure. 1
From these papers it appears, that when 1
the account of the tumult reached Paris, c
every artifice was used to impress the public tl
mind with an idea that the populace were
stirred up to the part they aded by the min- c
ifters of England and RufTia, who were o
hurt at the marked attention paid to tfie p
minister of France by the court ol Vienna, ft
A letter from Toulon of the 2cth Ger- t]

that the Dentral veflels can scarcely obtain al

ie SIR SIDNEY SMITH.
1 ' The following are the p- rtTculars of the
it escape of this brave officer from his imprison
*- ment in Paris t
Finding that all hope of an exchange was
'n vanished, and that the confinement was like
y ly to be more rigorous, Sir Sidney Smith,
â  determined on an escape the firft favourable
e opportunity that offered. He had some
d friends at Paris, who admiring his gallant
d ry, and commiserating his misfortunes, were
n anxious to efFeft his deliverance. It had
h been ordered by the minister of police, that
>f he and Mr. Wright, a gentleman taken pri
-- foner with Mr. Sidney, aud a partner in all
I- his misfortunes, (hould be removed from the
1 Temple Prison in Paris to another jail still
h more common, called the Gen. Depository.
0 (According to other accounts, this remov
h al was to a place distant from the capital.)
This removal was to have taken place on
n Tuesday fe'night last, and measures were ac
i, cordingly planned to effed a rescue of both
c these gentlemen.
e On that evening they were put in a fia
- ere or hackney coach, accompanied by two
e of the jailors. On their way to their new
e place of confinement a child ran across the
t. street, and was nigh being trampled upon by
the horses. At the fame time there was a
S violent (hrieking ; the coach flopped, and a
3 kind of mob instantly surrounded the carri
-1 age. The coach door was opened, and Sir
Sidney and Mr. Wright escaped.' A chaise
1 was in readiness to convey them instantly
out of Paris, which was done without the
flighted inconvenience or bustle. They made
t immediately for the coast about Havre, fen
ding guides forward to fee that all waÂ» fafe.
, Whenever they came near pods where there
were strong guards of military, called corps
a da furvcillancc, they either halted or tOok a
e circuitous route on foot. They were two
e days concealed in woods, in the neighbour
e hood of which was encamped a great part of
3 the army of England. 1 After a journey of
e 8 days, the guides condu&ed thenv Â»ery
1 faftly and fkilfu'ly to a place near Havre,
t where they got on board a fifhing vefTel, and
1 in a few hours after they fell in with the
1 British squadron cruizing off Havre. They
were taken on board the Argo frigate, capt.
1 Boweti, whojoyfully received these welcome
strangers, and on Saturday they were land
-1 ed at Portsmouth, amidst the acclamations
and congrat lations of all ranks of people,
â¢ who lined the streets as they paifed along. 1
The fame civilities were (hewn Sir Sidney at
; every place where he was recognized.
A few days previous to his escape, an or
â¢ der had been given by the Minister of Pol
i ice, to confine Sir Sidney more rigorously,
i and to limit the extent of the walk allowed
â  him to take the air, though it was only two <
hours each day. He had been nominally al-
I lowed a Louis d'Or a day by the govern
ment, but had never received any money
: for the last seven months. He had only the (
' ordinary al owance of the prison ; but sever
al friends did all in their power to render his '
1 situation as comfortable as possible.
Sir Sidney, as soon as he arrived in tqwn,
had a conference with Earl Spencer at the I
admiralty and afterwards paid a visit to the I
Prince of Wales at Carlton'Houfe.
The long and rigorous confinement which 1
Sir. Sidney has fuffered, has made a very j
unfavorable change in his person. His spi
rit, however, is unabated, and we hope <
that the air of Great Britain will soon rcf- J
tore his health. 3
There can belittle doubt that he can as- i
ford important intelligence to government j
refpefting the interior of France, notwith
standing the fituat on of which.he has efca- '
ped, as he was allowed a certain period of ,
the day for air and exercise, and it a&ive
and observing.
Sir Sidney dined yesterday with Lord 1
Spencer, at his Lordship's house in the ad
miralty.
Sir Sidney was taken prisoner on Mon
day the 18th of April, 1796.

The late eveats at Vienna have spread the uUnoft
confirmation al P.i:iflt is nfucb to be appre

, involve all Germany in ruin. It appears that Ber
nadotte is already arrived at Raftadt.
The answer which the deputation of the'empirc
I have returned to the note of the French plenipo
tentiaries, is evasive and infignifirant. They en
deavor to atoid any explanation upon the point of
secularization, although they have already reco -
nized the principles, and recur to coniiitiorj alrea
dy rej-ded.
Buonaparte is now going to Ra-ladt, like another
Alexander, no doulit, to c:ir the Gordian knot.
1 he troubles of the Swiss Cantons still contin
ue, particularly in the ncighborhoodof the lake of
I entrance. On the 13d of Germinal (April 12)
five hundred peasants attacked th-' town of Arbon,

: tllonties. V
; T hey state that the ansrehifts had exerted every
| effort to carry the election in favor of men of the
I chandler of Babosuf and his accomplice!. By ail
ing as one man with one will and determination,
on every question, they overpowered the well dis
posed majority, who were left united. A coura
geous feceffioh, howev.r, disappointed th.: parti
tizans of terrorism, and secured the cleSions of
Paris from the detestable influence of the partizans
anarchy.
We wait with a lively impatience to fÂ«e the part
which the lepiflative body will take, relative to
the various choices which have taken place, and
which seem to threaten us with the return of the re
volutionary tyranny, and to suspend it once more
over our heads. Ihe directory pronounces moll
decidedly against theufurpation of popular fuffra
ges. The direclory docs not disguise that there
is a faflion spread over the couotry, united in ob
jeit and exertion heftile to the Milling-conftitutioil,
and tinflured with the moll dtteftable principles
of terrorism. It is likewise asserted by the offi
cial journals, that aslaft year the partizans of roy
alty displayed the royal standard, the partizans of
' â¢rrorif.n have this year openly avowed their pur
'pofe.

We have the fatisfadHon to announce to our rea
ders that the Delaware sloop of war, capt. Decatur,
(who-only went out to sea on Friday) on Saturday
evening captured a French privateer schooner of it
guns and 70 men, close in with Egg-Harbour, and
last evening the prize was brought to Fort Mifflin.
Captain Decatur left his ftip at New-Castle, and
brought this intelligence to town. Capt. D. after
he got to sea on Saturday morning, met with the
Ihip Alexander Hamilton, from New-York to Bal
timore, the captain of which informed him that he
had been Dlundered by a French privateer, and gave
him directions what course he had fleered. Capt.
p. immediately went infcarch of her, and soon got
in fight of fcur fch.oners; but not knowing which
waj the armed schooner that he had received infor
mation of, he thought it best to stand off as if he
were a merchantman and alarmed at what might
be armed veflels.
The manoeuvre had the intended effeA, for the
armed schooner gave her chace, until Ihe discovered
the Delaware to be a vessel of force, when file at
tempted to iheer "if and get in land (where flie
supposed (he ihould be life, taking the Delaware
for an Engliih vessel of war) but'lhe was obliged
to surrender after a pretty long chace to the Dela
ware, and several (hot being fnxd at her. This pri
vateer is a new vessel said to have been built at
Baltimore. She failed from Cape Francois on the
19th of June, and has been on our coaff only two
days, during which time she has captured the fliip
Liberty Capt Vredenberg, which failed a few days
from this port for Liverpool The vessel wasfent to
the Weft Indies, and the Captain and Crew of the
Liberty were put on beard a vessel bound for Bos
ton. This privateer had also taken an Enrfifli
brig. 8

Fort Mifflin, july sth, 1798.
" While I was in C. Francois the capt of thÂ«
Brunfwick arrived with a flag of truce, and I be
lieve the French general thought it was fur the pur
pol'e of evacuating the Mole, but he was not long
left in this plcafing delirium ; imtead of '* Props-
Ctions" for evacuating the Woje, they wer; fqr
an exchange of prisoners: how great mud have
been his surprize ? and this was ,he bulineis of the
firft aid de iamp and officer ef the frigate ; and if
the gentleman who wrote the letter in the Phila

truth of the circumstances, he could not have asÂ»
fured his Philadelphia that the Mole would
be evacuated before eight lavs.
" I left the Gape the 18th of I une, and was (hort
ly after taken on board the ship Brunfwick, (with
the captain of tie velfel in which I was a passenger)
and detained for 4 hours, during which time I n:en
tioned the report that was in circulation at the
Cape to the captain, who informed me. that so far
from giving up the Mole,-hey have been putting it
in a stronger state of defence than it ever yet \va< ;
that they had established a dock yard, and lately re"
ceived from England upward of 60,000 i, erling
worth of malts, spars, and (lores; and the
evacuation of P. au Prince was in order to fti'iwth

TO BE LEASED FOR A TERM OF TEARS
TO be leafed, for a term not less than three,
nor more than seven years, a V ALVJABLE
PROPERTY* at the Seneca-Falls, in the county of
Onondago, and state of New-York, on the Banks'
of the Seneca-river, twojmi'es.weft.of the Cayuga
ferry, and eleven miles east of Geneva.
This eftablithment consists of an excellent grift
mill, saw mill, dwelling house, barn, and a port
age or carrying place, with between thirty and
forty acres of land s Onder good improvement, and
as much more in the vicinity, as maybe required
for future improvement.
The grill mill is a handsome, new and well finj
ifhed building, of 50 by 30 feet; 3 stories high
ami furnifhed with a run of excellent Burr stones
and another of Efopus* (tones, of the belt quality
âand the moil approved boalts, &c- calculated to
make all the different qualities of flour for expor
tation or for home consumption : It is accessible by
water from every part of the Cayuga lake and Se
neca-river, as well as from the Seneca-lakeâand
fromitsfituation,Vcommands a verycxKnfive and
encreafing custom : The flream on which it stands,
being the cutlet of the Seneca-lake, the mill cau
never be in want of water ; and as it has been kept
working during the fevcreft season of the lalt win
ter, it is not liable to be impeded by froft :
The saw millis also new, situated on the fame
flream, now furnifhed with an ample stock of
logs, of which a supply may at all times be pro
cured by land or water, of the belt quality:
The dwelling house is well calculated fcr the use
of the miller, is new, and fufSciently laige : The
barn iÂ« about 40 feet square, and entirely new :
The portage is 3*4ths of a mile in length, along
the Seneca-fallsâover which were pafied in the
last year, nearly two hundred boats with their
contents; this objeit is already productive of a
handsome income, which must be incrcafing andL
permanent :
Among the many advantages of thisfituation,.
must be numbered the fertility of thei'urrousding
country âbeing the beit improved part of the coun
ty of Onondagaâthe concentration of interâ
course by land and water, the Geneffee ftateroad'.
passing through it, as well as all water carriage to
Geneva, and the counties of Ontario and Steuben
which renders it a most eligible stand for a Store or
TavernâThe river and lakes abound ia filh and
fowl, and the country with deer ahd other game-
Eefides the mills already ere&ed at this place, itr
is calculated for any additional water works that
may be found necefiaryâFulling mill, baik mill,,
tannery, forges, &c. maybe ere Â£lcd at a small ex
pend âIron ore may be brought in boats Irom the-
Cayuga lake ; and it is thought to abound in the
neighborhood.
The stock on hand w'll be fold to the lefTee, and
the canle, utensils, smith's forge, See. may be fold
or let the prcmifes.
If apurchafe (hould offer for the whole or an
