To Mr. BENJAMIN WYNKOOP.\ the
A POWERFUL desire of afcertainin|j fy n
the origin and true cause of the Fever, whicrn p' cr
still unfortunately prevails in Philadelphia, f erl
induces me to address you again on the in- ,knc
terefting fubjeft, and to submit the follow- C( 1
ing particulars to your consideration, thro* <
a public channel, that the public may judge- w h
whose arguments and fadls are moll concln- An
five. the
With refpeft tp febrile contagion, it is p al
proper to observe, that all the irioft accurate p re
and best informed physicians agree that it h D (
never adls but when it is near to the source thi:
from whence it arises ; that i 3, eifher near to w ],
the bodies of men from which it immediate- anc
ly issues, or nearto some fubftauces which, nu!
having bem near to the bodies of men, are en t
imbued with the effluvia, and in which sub- <
fiances these effluvia are sometimes retained Q,
in an iflive state for a very long time. cd
The substances thus imbued with an aftive CO i
and cofitngious matter may be called somites, 0 f
and it appears probable and is confouant to
observation, that febrile contagion, as it arises. . CO i
from somites, is more powerful, than when ths
it arife3 from the human bo- ig
dy.â" The effluvia (fays the celebrated we
Cullen) which rises from marfties or moist fl u
ground, afted upon by heat, is universally. l o |
the cause of intermitting and remitting or an
bilious fevers." So many observations have j 3
been made with refpeft to this, in so many w j
different regions of the earth, as leare no on
doubt of the truth of this observation. w ]
The finiilarity of the climate, season and f lc
fpil in, the different countries in which inter- hÂ«
milting, remitting and bilious fevers (for Â£
they are all of the fame kind, differing on\y â  hi
in degree) arise and become epideitiic, and fh
the similarity of the diseases, though arising p,
in different regions, concur in proving, that O
there is one common cause of these fevers in
aH their varieties, and that this cause is the
effluvia of putrid vegetable substances, for |
of these the foil of niarlhy ground is chiefly
composed. f c
And human effluvia are universally the j al
cause of all continued fevers of a nervous Or f e
putrid kind, only varied in their lymptoms,' m
by the circumstances of climate, season, tem- ; r
perature of the air, condition of the foil, J
mode of living and Constitution of the patient f,
concurring with the effluvia and modifying tl
their power. o
It has now' been rendered probable thnt Q
the effluvia of marshes or putrid vegetable ,
substances are the cause of the intermitting <J
fever in all varietyâand that effluvia from f t
human bodies are the sole cause of thg con- tj
tinued fever in all its variety. g
The fevers produced by the effluvia of h
marshes, or moist ground, adled upon by
heat, are often epidemic, and sometimes ma- c
lignant ; but there is no maxim in experi- r ,
mental philosophy, no problem in geometry, (
better established, than that they are never e
contagious in any situation, notwithftand- t
ing what has been affertrd.by fuperficial ob- f
servers to the contrary : Whereas those pro- t
dcced by human effluvia are always more or v
less contagious in confined or impure and r
warm air. J <
That fevers arising frpm human effluvia c
are generally attended in the beginning with r
inflammatory symptoms in cold climates, ap* ! t
pears evident from Dr. Cullen's observations ,
relative to their symptoms in Scotland ; j c
hence he denominates the disease Synochus, 1 (
1. e. a fever beginning like inflammatory, t
and ending like a putrid fever. And that I
the inflammatory symptoms are still higher ,
and more evident when the disease-attacks J
persons of vigdrous constitutions, with an ,
inflammatory diathesis, in a hot dry season, j
is not only agreeable to reason, but
been often observed and recorded by differ- \
ent authors. 1
That the yejjpw fever is propagated by ,
contagion, that is from the effluvia of the
diseased conveyed a from its ]
source, through the medium of the air, and ,
received into a found body by the lungs, <
flomach, and perhaps the pores of the skin,
is a fadl too notorious to admit of difputeâ
and that the Coutagion by which it is pro
pagated is derived from living human bodies
under particular circumstances, I think the
following fails, extrafled ffom.different au
thors, fufficiently establish.
" The firft (hip which arrived towards
the latter end of this year (1758) from the
fleet in N. America, was the Loeftcffe. On
the 18 th of October, 18 of her men were
sent to the hospital, and 13 more on the a ift
â¢of the fame month. The scurvy', the flux,
Vjnd fevers were reported to be the prevaih'ng
diseases in that (hip,.
" The company of the Loeftoffe were in
perfeft health the 8 months they were in
America, and until a few days before their
departure from Quebec. At that time 6
recovered marines came on board from Point
Levy hospital, -ar.d in 48 hours afterwards,
among her company of 200 people, were
seized with fevers and fluxes.
Â« In some, the sickness began with a
flux, in others with a fever; but the flux
was generally moderate and gentle. The
fever continued commonly from 5 to 10
days ; â  two patients were distressed with it
for a'whole month. When the firft attack
was from the fever, a supervening flux
Droved faltitary ; but where the contagion
made its ftvft appearance with a flux, the
aceeffion of the fever carried off the patient.
Â«' This (hip was 27 days in her passage
to England from Quebec, and during that
time fix of "her men died.
Â« One of the crew, a Spaniard, having
relapsed, turned yellow on the 6th day of
the fever. His chief cpmplamt at this
â¦i me was an univerfnl unealinefs over his
â¢whole body, his head alpne being ur.aj.eft
ed He earnestly intreated to be bied ; .
t'nougli his pulse wis low T con fen ted to (pa
his repeated felicitations, and permitted a rib
small quantity to be taken from His arm. rule
The mass of this blood was exceedingly in I
viscid and fizv ; and after Sanding some oth
time, the gnimous concretion became co- wa
wred with a yellow gluten, hslf an inch in cor
thickness, impenetrable to the finger, tin- of
less cut by the nail ; the feWim being at '
the fame time of the confidence of thin the
syrup, and of a deep yellow colour. A nui
person, prompted by curiosity, tailed the fei:
I serum and found it bitter. Another, not on<
! knowing it to be the serum of blood, judg- ftri
cd it to be a competition of foot. ha;
11 This fever was plainly the fame as that bel
which was brought lrft year from North ric
America, and commonly by us denominated
the Tel'ow Fever. It was oftener aceom- an
panied with a flux than the fever of the we
preceding year ; and of the fickseÂ«t to the { in
hospital, a greater proportion died from thi
this (hip than from any other ; for of 34 att
which were admitted, some with the flux, ne.
and others with the scurvy, but the greatest |
number with the fever, we loft nine pati- j fa<
ents. ' j th
" In November, after the conquest of | L
Quebec, the North American fleet return-* M
cd to England, with several of the (hips' j tie
in perfeft health ; while the crews on
of others were afflidled with an a&ive and ; ttt
pj|verful contagion. . The mod vigorous :fo
.contagion was in the Dublin and Neptune;
the former had buried in their passage home
19 men, and on her arrival at Spithead 96
were reported, to the hospital in fevers, -
fluxes and the scurvy. The Neptune had
loft 160 of her complement in a few months,
and on her arrival her sick lift contained
133 sick. The surgeon had been seized
with the yellow fever, but had recovered :
one of his mates had a fifth relapse into it,
when at Spithead. Some attributed their
sickness to the French prisoners whom they
had received on board ; others to the New
England volunteer*, whÂ« were very sickly ;
but the fever was introduced into several
(hips by the marines from the hospital at
Point Levi."*
Observations on the phenomena produced
1 by this contagion, as they were written '
at different limes, in the wards of the n
" | hospital, by the experienced Lind.
' \ " 20th November. The crifi* of this '
fever happens at no fixed period, nor on
: \ any certain day that can be foretold. A
r few had spots ; on some they were petechial, c
> most of whom are well ; as also many who 1
- in the course of the dfeafe hecame yellow. r
1 This yellowness is at present much more 1
* frequent than vhe spots. The tindlure over I
J the (kin is universal, of a deep yellow tinge, 1
often painful, and disagreeable to the fight. '
1 One Afhley hjs relapsed three times, and
e 'in each relapse there appeared this jaun
, dice. The blood taken from a marine re
n fembles that of the Spaniard before men
- tioned, is viscid and glutinous ; both the
gluten and the serum, as well at the patient, !
f being yellow.
Y " Three men from the Cambridge, re
ceived into the hospital December 14th,
i- report, that the company on board the
U Cambridge, confiftiag of 650 men, had
' r enjoyed a good state of health for a long
time past, until they, with some of their
(hipmates, were ordered on board the Nep
>- tunc to prepare that (hip for the dock,
ir which was then in diftref6 for want of men,
mod of her people being at the hospital.
' Of those three men, one became spotted
is on the sth day and died, and another nar
h rowly escaped with life ; and I have reason
' to believe, that their other (hipmatei who
13 were employed in the Neptune, communi
-! cated the distemper to the Cambridge, as
B>l 8 > 1 (he soon after sent several with the fever to
ft the hospital."
at! Â«Â« When those men from the Cambridge,
tT one of the moil healthy (hips then in the
18 fleet, became infefled, the contagion by
which they \Â»cre infeÂ£ted, did not proceed
n > jrom any person JUL in the Neptune, (fÂ»r
a.3 U pon the firft appearance of any man being
*- there taken ill, he was immediately sent to
the hospital), but from the infection retsin
>y ed in the (hip."f
it "It was a'#j at this time very remarka
ts ble, that no seamen but those who had been
Td on board the American (hips, were seized in
[â¢Â» this hospital with that fever, notwithftand
â l ing their frequent intercourse."
- M The praftice of cleanliness, and the be
nefit of the fre(heft air, did not avail to re
ies move this contagion ; which continued till
he the (hips were, taken into dock ;md properly
u * purified by fire and fnoke âAfter this ope
ration the ship and crew became perfe&ly
ds healthyâThis was the cafe likewise with all
the N. American vessels."
3n (Perhaps the severe frofts which set in a
;re bout this time had some (hare in this faluta
!ft ry effect.)
ix, Â«Â« On board mod of the other (hips of
n g war we were able to trace out the importa
tion of the contagion, from guard (hips,
in from jails, unseasoned landfir.en, contam'inat
in { d pcrfons or ships."Â£
en' Sometimes only one man in a (hip may
6 be seized with a petechial or yellow fever,
;n * and all the reft continue tfnaffe&ed. The
ds, Magnanime was 7 weeks at sea in 1760,
ire w ith 700 men. Upon her return to port
only y were sickâone of them with a fpot
a ted fever, of which he diedâ" Another
ux person was sent from the Raven (loop with
he the yellow fever, of which he also died, and
1 0 yet no pcrfons on either of these (hips were
infe&ed."

" Citizen Lefage, commifTary of war for 1

ged with the police of the division of Chaf- 1

tifies, that after the said general had given 1

lo nerary which had been given to him, or
j_ knowing that the Ferte Alars was within
a3 the conditutional limits of Paris, he cxpe
,o dited the order for the route, in consequence
of which the troops were to marchâthat
he followed the fame route to Rheimsâthat,
le * being there afTured that the letters he has
written to Charvelle, with directions to the
municipalities of the places through which
Br the troops were to pass, had been duly re

t p take, as'the municipal adminidrations were
n _ charged with quartering and providing for
the troops, he yielded to the desire of fee
a_ ing his family who reside at Chartres, and
EU left rtie route of the division to take the

fits, that neither general Richepaufe, -ior

liace ed myielf to reply without preparation, to
nity, a written speech, w*ere I not persuaded
â fs to -that I should be received with indulgence
their by my colleagues, and were I not addressing
ution men, convinced as I am, that the opinions
lence to which we ought to listen with the great- â 
upon eft attention, are precisely those from which
erals, we diflent. I proceed to the examination |
f our of the different proportions, laid down in tM
e ex- the speech of Lamarque. He considered H
rfs of as unconstitutional the attention which you 1
:d ar- had bestowed upon the events which have j
izens lately taken place, and particularly upon B
have the inarch of the troops. It would be dif
ie re ficult more eompjetely to confound two ob- j
thei jedts very diftindt. Thb uirtftory doubtlesspoffefTes the right to put the troops in mo
tlon, and to determine the mode in whicl
they shall be employed. But does it follow
that their muft never occup]
your attention, especially when it is tracec
to a point which the troops cannot pas:
without your authority ? The conftitutioi
gives the legislative body the right to re
quire information from the dire&ory. Tliii
information is intended to enlighten you'
committees entrnfted with the preparatior
of the laws. Upon what objeft more im
portant could you require information, thai
upon the march of the troops, and upor
the extraordinary events which have foi
some time taken place ? Nay more, the di
rkfkory had fharcd your fblicitude, and hac
solemnly promised to examine into the au
thor of the order, the name of whom you
had demanded. So far then there is a(per
feft agreement between the two powers.
Both united to investigate the cause of the
extraordinary movement which occasioned
general anxiety. How then does it happen
that to day a reprcfentative of the people
ventures to afTert, that you have violated
the constitution ? Doubtless you had vio
lated the constitution, if you had not view
ed with the mod serious attention the move
ments organized around you. Noâby this
conduft you did not trench upon the power
/of the diredtory ; and thirf opinion, in which
you all agreed, naturally me to point
out the fyftctri which ha 3 been assiduously
pursued to counttraft the legislative power,
by extending uniformly, a.,d under uirery
pretext, the limits of the executive autho.
rJtjr. You are now accused of encroaching
upon its privileges. In the fame manner
were you told, that you had not the right
to /hut up the popular societies, to publish
a proclamation in order to demonstrate" to
the French people the parity of your inten
tions : to seek information now becomes ne-
Ceflary ; to hear reports; to require that
positive answers (hould be fubdituted to
communications completely evasive. To
trust the partisans of such a system, the le
gislative body would soon be reduced to
the impotence of only enacting laws. f Some
members laughed ; several voices, " Jt jbould
be so.") Allow me to finifh. Two efien
tial attributes characterize your pow -; you
enatt laws, but you retain the right of su
perintending their execution. In order to
exereife this Superintendence, you must in
vestigate ; you must hear reports, upon the
result of which you form your opinions
and prepare the laws, which it is your bu
' fmefs to introduce. Neither was I less
astonished to hear it said that this tribune
had refoundsd with accusations againftfome
of our generals. I call upon the whole
council to bear witness to the truth of what
lam about to aflert. Never has any speaker
omitted an opportunity of bestowing, with
in these walls, a just tribute of praise upon
our generous defenders, and upon their glo
rious chiefs. Recoiled that memorable day,
whert the preliminaries of peace were an
nounced. With what feufibility did he
who preSided on that occasion, declare that
the French armies, crowned with vjftory
and with peace, had deserved well of hu
manity. Tears Streamed from your eyes.
The delicate touches of the orator went to
your hearts ; it is true, my colleaguesâ
(a.general cry, " Yes, yes.")â Who has
rot pronounced with sentiments of affeftion
the illuftrioui name of the pacificator of
La Vendee ? Has that of the hero of I'.aly
ever been mentioned without exciting en
thusiasm ? Never within these walls did we
omit to pay homage to his great qualities ;
his humanity, even his moderation obtained
just apologists. Was it not here that the
firft tribute of thanks for his generous con
duct towards the ministers of religion exiled
from France, was Voted ? I know that
abuses which had crept into the account
of certain funds, which appear, to have
been diverted, were mentioned. But can
it be imagined that it ever enttred into our
minds to accuse our generals of these dila
pidations, to require from the man who
levelled the Austrian power, and discon
certed their military plans, a mechanical at
tention to the drynefs of financial calcula
tions ? No. We never conceived such an
idea. But what could be thought of us if
the delapidations of secondary agents,a thou
farid times denounced by the generals them
selves, did not engage our attention ? Be
cause dilapidations are committed in the
armies, must we Shut our eyes ? tiuft we o
vertKrow the constitutional system of ac
counts, and substitute an arbitrary diltribu
tion in the room of the regular administra
tion of the trcafury ? We have heard here
of some Strange power or other given to
your committee of infpedtors. Believe me,
representatives, in this refpeft you have done
no more than your duty. If no conspira
cies exilt, so much the better, my most ar
dent wiShes are accomplished. If they do,_
you have my GnceVe thanks ; you have
cheeked their progress, you have disconcert
ed their effeas by your wisdom and by your
firm moderation. Is it really neccfTary then
seriously to refute those who have no other
mode of blaming your conduit than by tel
ling you, " Impeach the direttory ?" Ate
those who employ this language ignorant
that such a system which they pretend is
constitutional, would be fubverfire of the
principles of bur representative government.
Opposition in our eyes, then must be uncon
stitutional. Look at our neighbours the
English, look at thÂ« Americans : are you ig
norant that in their parliament and in their
senate, the ministerial power, and the royal
authority are attacked, are cenTured, and
that the censures of these authorities would
be their most Sirm fijpports, if instead of cen
sure it was meant to overthrow ? It may be
neceflary to censure what it would' be crim
inal to subvert. We have heard a great
deal also of the industry which calumny ex
erts to villify the republican institutions and
authorities. No authority, lam perfuad
td, is more the objeft of calumny at this '
moment than our own. But let a few wild j
demagogues, let a few Stupid anarchists mis- ;
represent tbefe opinions and accuse our in- '
- teiitiorisâOf flrhat importance is it- ? Tj utl
1 is immoveable : It too is a power. Byth;
t light of its torch will the people of Franc<
r analyze your proceedin s, and judge ofyoui
I j conduit. It is fmd that the priests return

- of those returned, their language, their
i audacity. Do not the laws exilt ?Is it pof
l fible to imagine a power more extensive,
r more absolute, more monstrous than thai
- of the direftory with regard to emigrant'! i

NORFOLK, September 28.
By a gentleman pafitngrr in the DaÂ»i/h (hip,
Chritlians Haven> Capt. Patrick Corran,
arrived yesterday in 43 days from Tene
riffe, we have received the following :
Defeat of the British at Tenerijfe.
On the morning of the 22d of July, the
town of Santa Cruz was alarmed at the ap--
pearance of 7 English Ihips lying off,' and
36 armed boats that ranged across the liar- '
bour. It feemefi evidently their witenrior
to have landed in town before day, but fc.il
ing in that attempt they returned to the (hip
ping. At 10 o'clock, about laoo men
were landed, and polled thentfelves upon th<
summit of a fecoud ridge of mountains jon
the N. E. while the Spaniards were Ration
ed on the firft ridge, which commanded the
entrance into the town by a narrow passage.
/Some trifling firing ensued without loss on
either fide. At night the English re-em
barked, and the ships ftood"!>ff and on until
the evening of the 24th, when all came to
anchor. A bomb ketch commenced a par
tial fire on a distant fort, by way of attract
ing the attention of the Spaniard*, which
was warmly returned. Between one and
two o'clock the town was alarmed by the
approach of boats, and the forts iuftantly
commenced . a heavy and incefiant fire on
them. The darkness of the night favored
the views of the English, and between 8 and
900 landed in two parties on each fide of
the castle. One small party of 50 men com
manded by adn #.l Nellon, and capt. Bow
en landed on the Mole ; the firft loft his
right arm, and immediately returned on
board. Capt. Bowen with most of his little
party was killed advancing to the charge.
The other party penetrated into the. town,
aflaulted the castle, were repulsed and at last
took refuge in a convent. Thither they
were pursued by the Spaniards, who by this
time had placed cannon in the ftreetsand a
venucs that led to it. The English finding
themselves ftirronnded on tvery fide, offi-;\;d
terras to at he general, in Which they propo
sed to march out, without cloing injury to
the town, upon condition of being delivered
the money in the pu v Uc treasury, and the
cargo of a Manilla (hip in the harbour, which
they erroneously supposed worth lo or k
millions. '
The Spanish general was fired wfth indig
nation at the proposal, and was about giv
ing the signal for massacre, when they sur
rendered upon condition of marching out
with their arms, alid not fcrving in any ex
pedition again# the Canary illands for 12
months. The loss of the Eiij'iiih was a
botn 100 killed and wounded on fhpj-j?, and
the officers supposed between Iyd and 200
drowned in a cutter that and from
theii boats in larfding. The: Spaniards un
der arms were 18-killed a.nd 30 wounded, 1
together with some private persons who:
were imprudently iiithe streets, among whom
was Mr. C. Roonev, an Irish gentleman,; i
known for his humanity to the diflreffed,'
and generous affiflanee and attention to fo
reigners who visit the island. .
The capitulation being signed and the
prisoners collefted on the Mole. The Spa- 1
nifh general caused bread w ine so be givi

the wounded, and humanelv offered twiake
those under his care, who fhoiild.be thought
too ill to be carried on boa'd, : âHe receiv
ed a very handsome letter from admiral Nel-.
son, in which was expressed unbounded
gratitude for his humanity, adding that he
would take thefirft opporfunity'of commu- 1
nicating it to his sovereign.
The Bvrtith officers very honorably de
clared that their 'intention was not to have'
kept pofTeffion of the island.had they taken
It, as they supposed that peace was at that
time concluded ; but only to require the
money in the tre alary, and the cargo of the
Manilla ihip. It was nÂ«t unw.fonable in
their enemies to presume that as that requi
sition would not have amounted' to one-tenth
of the sum they expected, ft wtfiild have
been raised from their private property,
The persons who composed the expedi
tion were sailors, the crews of the different

CAUTION.
WHERF.AS a combination of men in this
county have undertaken to enrich thÂ«m
felves.by fabricating titles to fundr/ valuable tract*
of land, the property of gentlemen lining in New _
York, Philadelphia, Lordon andtaris, for which
trails of land large fumi of money have been paid
n to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers
It iÂ» therefore ju(l that public information should
be given, to the end, that the injured snay seek re
- dress while the men have property, and are to b$
found. Those who have beÂ«n discovered are Tru- ,
man Haarifon, Joseph Witsomb, said notv to rc
fide in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several othert who go under fiilitioi s names. It is
supposed that the lands offered fc r sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at least worth fifty thousand
'* dollars. Such as we have adlual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and 11, Otfego patent,
thousand acres each, the atftual property of William
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
at Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and James Averitl
b- and others, ot this State. There is some grounds
id t0 fuppofc that the lands of Richajd Wells and
d- Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
c, management. âThe Printers will do well to give
b- this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
th public against purchasing those lands, as also to de
n- prive those men Â»n future from mipofujg on iddivi
be duifs, which their education and addrels have en
Â°f abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
Â»e a (hopkeeper of some note in this eourrtry.
be The following affidavits will fct in a clear point

m- t he public have perused, will induce them to ex

PREVENTION AND CURE OF THE
YELLOW FEVER.
EVER since this difeale made such ravages in this
i city and New-York, the author has turned his
attention to its caufet and cure.âThe relult of his
enquiries has convinced him that the reason why so
few persons recover from its attacks, are from itÂ»
not being well underload, and the consequent
wrong method taken to cure it. He is persuaded
that the exceflive bleedigns and mercurial reatment
of the Faculty is highly injurious, and that the on
ly rational mode of treatment is hy the use of proper
acids. Convinced of this he offers his Specific as a
certain remedy, if ufeJ according to the dirc&ions.
