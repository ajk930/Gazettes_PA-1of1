THE CONSTITUTIONAL IEST. ? r
â¢ , Â»-"â 
MR. IBSSBU, | '
STATE SOVEREIGNTY, wasbnee
a popular do&rine, and fame members of |
former legiflatnrea, seemed to think it con-
filled in the foveretfoty of the general court j 1 "
cwr the state, and all its creditors, so far
as to make void all state obligations howev-
er faaftioned bylaw, if they should judge tj
them to be unreasonable forgeting that â¢ 1
the foweign people had formed a ctnflitution J
to be a/Â«Ttz to legillators, and to guarantee
the fame, had required an oath of the re-
prefentatives and senators to " naintaia it" 0
â" To the ead it may be a government of
laws, aad not of men," tbfr legtflative and
judicial pawcrs were to be separate and dif
tinft from eaeh other ; but how can thi3 be
if the ltgiflature is foverujn and can judge
of its own contraAs ? 1$ sot the right of . .
tfSc people to a trial by ajury, destroyed by -
such an exchifive power in the legiftature > _f
Is not this an exercise of the judicial pow
er contrary to the plain letter and meaning
th* conftitutioo ? Is not the judicial
branch degraded by such assumption of poiv. .
er in the legfflative branch of the govern-
Bent ?âls it Bot extremely dangerous to . r
the equal rights and liberties of the citizens
to have the greatest fafeguard in theconfti- c "
tution, the judicial power (containing the
all important right of trial by a jnry) in-J 0
fringed by the legiflativc branch ? If fa cap- Â°f
ital a departure from the eonftitution is per
mitted, it will fooa be fanftioned by "U- ft
foge." This precedent, may countenance "3
every future infraftion, whenever the legif- bt
latnre may think it expedient to exercise JC
the powers vested in the other branches of la
the government. In this state, no doubt, ed
the reprefentativea have meant well ; but the aÂ£
people meant to have the eonftitution ob- It
served, or they would not have made it, n '
and fanAioned it by an oath.âTherefore, tr
"to the law, and to the testimony," is the at
rule for the people and the legislatures. Â°-
It is well known, that the cause by which at
the ancient republics all perilhed, was their
not being properly balanced with three n "
branches, and the most numerous body ol
bearing down the others. Such has ever he
been the effeft of uncbarteted power, in ol
the nsoft numerous branch of the govern- g'
mcnt ; and the experience of paft'ages, and tl
the present time, proves that fueh a fvue|- ei
reign power will commit the wildest afts of m
tyranny. Witness modern France ; and ly
fee Georgia. th
The cause is obvious ; a few men gener- ei
ally govern, or lead the representative body w
itl-tretubers 'Â»er (" nuaacrons, and U fc
the rtiling few adopt errors, ujc ngvu ui
the citizens cannot by any means be fafe o!
without the right of appeal to the judicial di
< power for an explanation of the eonftitution fc
and the laws ? di
It is evident to all Americans, that a free fÂ«
government cannot eayfl without the foil si
right of trial by e jury, how then does it tl
come to pass that this right is not preferv- n
ed { It is owing to ancient cuflom, was so be- r<
fore the revolution, and the strange power of w
ancient precedents seems to have been greater u
with many men, than the new eonftitution. f]
The people generally keep a watchful e
eye over the executive branch, but appre- o
hend lefa danger from the legislative, as its v
members are numerous aAd proceed immedi- c
â¢tely from themselves. In this country ii
the executive power ia too weak, and liber- h
ty is in danger from this ci rcumftance. But b
is there not still greater danger that the ju- n
dicial power may be so impaired as tolofe t
its neceflary influence in the government ? h
The legislature is more numerous, and na- c
turally stronger, than the other two branch- f
es, and nothing but the vigilance of the j
people can prevent the balance being totally t
, loft, and the lcgiflators becoming real ar'tfle- r
crats in power. Did we not fee one branch 1
of the legislature of the Union contend for c
the tontrou! of the executive power in mak- :
ing treaties ?âHave we not seen some state c
legislatures (besides Georgia) invade the jut
dicial department ? The usurping brancS <
will always pretend, "it is to secure the (
rights -of the people." The great princi- I
t pie ia the eonftitution, which Separates the I
three great powers in government, is evi- I
dently founded in the highest wisdom ; in 1
such a " balanced government of laws,"
the three branches arc checlt upon each
other ; âand not only honest men, but
rogues (if such (hould ever chance to be in
, t power) will guard against encroachments
d on the department in which they are.
But for the people Jo watch the execu
tive and judicial powers only, is to guard
a the litrfe gate of the citadel and leave the
great great one open.
CITIZENS.
f. THE GHOST.
Si An account of a remarkable effort to recov
er liberty, aad which may be depended
_ 011 as a faft.
Near the close of the month of July 1790,
tie ship Broot, Samuel Oliver commander,
left the Island of Antigua, on her pafiage ]
to Europe. The veflel had not been many
days at sea, before one of the seamen, on
his watch, was alarmed with the appearance
1 of fomethiag, which he fancied to be no o.
ther than a ghost: he eommunicated what
lct he saw, or supposed he had seen, to his
, rs ' messmate.
c . A few nights had now pasTed ftnee tbeter
ror stricken sailor had divulged his tale,when
11 he, as well as his fellows on the watch, were
ho alarmed by theCelf fame apparition: It mov
ed, according to the account they gave to
Â» the chief mate on the relief of the watc^
in flow pare all round Ac iorflcÂ® ut ,
and after continuing sometime ',
ed behind the windlafc. The mate: nie jj|
to laugh at the account; nevertheless he had
hi* fears ; and it waÂ« agreed on that hwpiett
together with the boatswain anrf Cfveral o
ther stout hearted fellows, should assist t e j
watch to difeover, if possible, what it was j )01
which had so moch alarmed the greatest part , )ig
of the ctew. The main deck was accord- ha(
, ingly walked by tnefe heroes, night alter
night, without the ghost making its appear-
I ance. Having been upwards of twenty a } s
lat sea, the weather in the night became boi - e j t
tcrous ; the windsblew; the thunder roue t j e
awfully, and the'lightning flalhed ternhcal- hi|
ly vivid; all hands were called up l Â° a ' tio
the (hip by their labors ; and in the rniaic or
their profeffional employ the ghost a/ain afl
mada its appearance; and it was naw seen Â£. q]
by the whole crew (the captain excÂ«pted) . j pa
One of those employed on the quarter deck i t j Q
rushed forwards towards the supposed phan
torn ; and at the instant it seemed within his ,
grasp, a of lightning of the mod tre-1 # f |
mendous fort covered it from his fig)* l: 1 his ;
was seen by the men on the yards, who were
reefing the 1 frveral fails, and who, one and j n
idl, declared it could be no other than the
devil, as he funk from the attempt of the | en
sailor in a fla(h of fire. Several of the jg C
sailors were positive it could be Â»o other , j l( .
than the evil spirit, for reasons to them the
mo ft fufficient; that they miffed their beef, j R
their biscuit and their grog, whenever all fcc
hands were called on deck; that they had a.-
so heard could neither eat nor ; j, a
drink ; and what confirmed them stronger q
in their belief of it being no 'other than lu-
cifer himfelf wa6, fiom its vamfhing the pre- j u
ceding night, in a flame of fire ; and some j
of them were not wanting to give it as their w
opinion, that he had raised the dorm. f rl
The affair of the gboft had now become he
serious, and the mate accordingly determin- ve
ed on acquainting the captain with the whole ti<
business on the fcJllowing day : This being pe
accordingly done, the captain heard the re- w
lation with fhme and communicat- th
ed the mysterious account to h.s passengers,
a iking them at the fame time their advice. ; in
It was agreed upon to walk the deck that < so
night, and there form their opinion of the j L
truth of the report: They began their march d(
about ten, and continued it until the break i n<
of day ; the ghost or devil did not appear ; i tl
and bringing to mind what was said by some ! n<
of our greatest poets, that the troubled fpi- j tt
rits haunt our regioa but while darknef* and h;
obfeurity fill the void, they retired to their c<
beds, probably well fatisfied with the event C
of their watch. The captain and paffea- it
gers naw pat down the whole story as no o- o
ther than the effeCt of imagination in the h
erew : But the Bien were not to be thus a- p
mused out of ar. opinion which they all firm- w
ly believed; and they still persisted in what ri
they had faidand seen: whatfervedto height- p
en their credulity still more, was an event p
Which had taken place but a few hours be- a
r i_i ââj mmmUi w
âº"wi'uamrt'oek*." This excited new curi- b
ofity j and the captain, finding it woild be e
difficult to prevail Wr their prejudices, of
fered"* reward to him or them who would o
discover who or what this devil was. A t
fellow who had, through the whole of this C
lingular affair, appeared less alarmed than j
the reft, was the firft to undertake the hufiÂ» v
ness ; and the others of the (hip's company f
readily agreed to assist in the discovery. To f
r work they went, when, after having moved \
â¢ upwards of forty hogsheads ef sugar, the 1
spirit was difcoyered asleep in an empty wat
[ rr butt: It was no other than a Negro man I
. of about twenty year* of age, who, with a 1
i view of recovering bis liberty, had there fe- I
- I creted himfelf. His story, when brought
â  into the cabin, was nearly as follows : That '
-! he belonged to a Mr. Alexander Coates, (hip 1
t | builder in the town of St. John's ; that his I
- I master having ftnt him in a canoe to get i
: I turtle grass, and put it on board this vessel,
? he accordingly didfo, and it being the dusk
â  of the evening when he delivered it, a tho't 1
- struck him, that such an opportunity would <
: probably never offer again for his getting
j to England; he therefore flipped down a
- rope which was hanging over the stern, put
l bis jacket into a canoe, and keeping hold
r of the stern rape, cut hi* boat adrift, and
- afceoded the vessel undiscovered. He now
e crept into the fore hatchway, and got into
- the hold, where, finding the empty water
a calk, he took out it* head, end therein he
e fccreted himfelf during the space of thirty
i- three days, seven of which was while the
e ship lay is St. John's harbor (during which
i-1 time the canoe had been pickted up, and the
n man given up as drowned), and twenty-fix
" at sea. His manner of liviig was, when
h the sailor* were all on deck* he would Jteal
it out, and pick up" what he could find, and
n I carry it to his tub; and also turnout at night
ti when he thought all quiet,' to breathe the
I refrefhing air. After the discovery he work
i-1 ed as a seaman, having, previous to this trip
rd made two voyages to Liverpool; and he was
ie named by the sailors Jack Choft; an-! those
I brave fellows seemed rather diverted than
I hurt by the consternation he had thrown
1 them into. (N. T. paper)

v fia
MONDAT âFEBRUAR* 5'
(Concluded from jejl'rday s Gaz'tte.) pe
Mr. S. Smith's te2;mony. When the
house was balfoting he left his feat to take f#
his letters from the letterbox; the houie his
had not adjourned but the members *Â«ere pe
in -conversation in different parts of the qu
house. He passed by Mr. Lyon and the w<
speaker who were in,converfation. riewas
either reading or writing when his atten- q
tion was called by a conversation behind j
him; he heard something of the converfa- d(
tion, and a question was asked Mv. Lyon as
to an opposition in Vermont to the Ramp
aft, and as if Mr. L. was to have brought M
forward petitions against it. He did not t j Â£
i pay particular attention to all the convcila
| tion, though it was loud enough ; something on
; was said by Mr. G. which he did not hear, u ;
j but which occasioned a loud iaugh; he was w j
' afterwards informed this was the question W(
' about the wooden sword. Mr. Lvon ap- tQ
! peared to be addressing the fptaker and fay- h
ing to him that the members of Connecticut
' afted against the opinions of their conftitu-: Â£e
l*nts: Mr. Brookes asked whether he had OI
j gone through his diftri*. Mr. Lyon said fa|
!he had and mentioned a few towns. Mr.
Brooks jokingly observed that he had been n<;
in the back ground as tie had frequently
been before. Mr. Lyon obftrved on the ol
bett:r information the people of Vefrtidnt
' had, compared with those of Connefticut. (jj
On this Mr. Brookes good humouredly ob- w
served, that they proved this by the great
luminary they had sent. Mr. Lyon then ob- nc
served that the members of Connecticut t j,
would always be willing to accept of office*
from 9000 dollars salary to Z 000. He
heard Mr. Lyon in the course of the con- e<
verfation fay, that the members of Connec
ticut did not speak the sentiments of the q
people and he seemed to insinuate that they a(
were willing to receive any office; that {j
there were maViy democrats in Connefticut ;
âthen the speaker said, perhaps this might jj
| induce him no longer to eonfefs he had t }
I some Connefticut blosd in. his veins. Mr. w
! Lyon said, democrats in the manner he un- (
1 derftood the word; Mr. Grifwold removed f Â£
1 near Mr. Lyon. He (Mr. 1..) observed,
; that he had had to fight the people of Con- jj
i nefticut in his awn diftrift who endeavoured ; r
J to indispose the people towards him; but he
had repelled their attempts and thought he Â£
could effeft a revolution in sentiment in t ]
Connefticut andÂ»change the representation;
in which the speaker said he would fpaie {j
one perhaps; he said perhaps he might, for
his conduit was more conformable to the o- G
pinion* of hi* constituents. But all this
was said jocularly. While Mr. Lyon was n
repeating some of those observations res- t
â  pelting the difference of opinion of the peo- a
pie of Connecticut and
Mr. G. said he would not r
be able to change the opinion of the mean
est hostler in the state. t
Mr. Lyon then said he was of a different
1 opinion, and that if he went there he would t
. be able to effeft what he said he could. Mr. {
1 G. then replied; when you do go there, 1
1 you had better take the wooden sword that t
- was attached to you atâ Mr. Lyon here (
r spit in his face, and Mr. Grifwold with s
) feemitig composure and great deliberation 1
1 wiped it. He, Mr. Stnith, then left the <
: house. 1 1
Mr. Lyon asked, whether he heard the â 
i beginning of the conversation refpefting j
1 Vermont, and of hi* turning it from V<r
- raont to Canucfticut. ]
t Mr. SmithâHe heard a very few words,
t with fomt indiltinift allulions, he did not ;
p know who from, as if Mr. Lyon had some
s thing to do with the oppodtion to the flamp ,
t aft in Vermont.
, Mr. Brookes next gave his testimony.
k He had heard part <<f the conversation be
t tween Mr. Lyon and it rela
d ted to the conduft of the members of Con
g neÂ£ticnt refpeÂ£tiug the motion of the mem
a ber from Virginia. They spoke pretty
it loud and the speaker checked them, by the
d observation dated in his testimony. Mr.
d Dana retired. A conversation took place
w between Mr. Lyon and the speaker of
o which he did not hear the beginning. A
bout this time Mr. Grilwqld came and fat
e down to his left. The conversation then
y became louder and he heard the speaker
ie and Mr. Lyon convert about the conduft
h of the members fiom Connecticut. He
ie~ stated, that on his return he had passed
ix through some part of that state and had an
:n opportunity of collecting the opinions of
al the people of it. He said, that nine tenths
id of the people of Connecticut differed in
hit their sentiments from their representatives in
ie this house. He said, that the members
k- from that state did not fairly represent their
ip
as own interest, were looking for offices and
ife that it was immaterial what the salary was,
an and that whether 9000 or 1000 dollars they
vn thought it still an objeft worth their atten
tion. He observed he had lived many years
= in Connecticut and wa3 well acquainted with
the dispositions of the people of that (late ;
that he had often to fight them in his own
state, when they came to fee ( their relations
at and that he Wa* always able to convince
w " them that they were wrong ; that he had
' e " no doubt if he went to Connecticut and set
3fn up a (in which he understood he was
concerned in Vermont ) he wfluld be able to
' turn out the whole representation ; he did
not hear the exception of one member ; he
did not pay veiy partienlar.atttention to it
as it wa* said jestingly. ' I asked whether
be had gone through mydiftriCt ; he said
he had ; b,"t he bad no hopes of them.
He then made a comparison between the
firft light possessed by the of Vermont
and those of Connecticut. I said jokingly,
that theÂ»Vermontefe proved their superiori
ty by the great luminary ther had {eat
""V - "

was dated with perfeft accurac

that the people of Connecticut were c* â¢

Mr. Clay. How often did you hear Mr.

1 the speaker said three times.
Mr. Speaker. I only heard ,t,he expref

Mr. Lyon. Did you expeft fc'>* j*'

â¢ A. This is not a proper qutftip. .

r- Mr. Brent. From the knowledge yoa
had of the circumftance4 of the story of thÂ«

>t man from Vermont would bear allusions to it
s- without being irritated ? This is a proper
p question ; to which a plaia answer ought to
be given.
r. Messrs. and Otis contended the
question was improper. Mr. Brent defend*

1- improper. _ f

Tuesday, February 6.
Macon thought the experience of yefter
1 id proved, that the mode adopted in the
lotion of witnefTcs on the fubjeft of the
of the committc of privileges, was not
i. In his opinion th? ceurfe adapted in
lir of Whitney and Randal wouid be far

This motion, after a few observations, was

The Speaker laid before the hoafe a report Â»f

and Mr. Grifwold, Mr. Dent in the chair ;
whets Mr. Hofmer, from New-York, proceeded
to give his evidence which differed a little, as
far as it went' from that delivered by the
speaker.
Mr. Dana was next called upon. Mr. D.
said his feelings were pretty ftrongiy intereftad
IE the business before the house ; and as there
. were o'her gentlemen more particularly ac
-1 with thÂ«-trinfa<S!ion, for reasons which

it should be deemed neceuary. He said
and siveÂ» his teflimony before the commit

remarks. He had, therefore, no de

:-r members, in giying an account of the
converlation which pifTed between him and Mr.
Lyon before the Speaker cameupto them & cau
tioned themtobecool. ThisconverfatioÃ,it seems,
arose from Mr. Williamsof N. Y. having told Mr
Dana, that Mr. Lyon had said to him, " that
the reprefeatatives from Connedlicut would all
be turned out, if they voted against Mr. Nicho
las's amendment." Mr. Dana questioned Mr.
Lyoii on thefubje<3, and MrÂ« Lyon replied that
he bad not said so, but " but that they wouM
all be tÃrnfid out, if they carried their point,"
and it was afterwards explained to be " that the
grefident flbsuld baye power to appoint men to
offices where the appointments were not autho
riftd by law." Xht warmth which the Speaker
â¢f.terrKDfed, was principally occasioned by the
olleldenying and the other maintaining that this
was theobjeft of Mr. Nicholas's motion.
Mr. Ccit, from Conncftiftit, was nyct called
upou. His evidence was left full and particu
lar than any of the preceding, as he pfofefTed he
but little notipe of the conversation which
ie heard paffiug. a*-V
Judge Chipman, a senator from Ver'niont,
-ras next examined. His evidence principally
went tppcove the manner in which he had heard

Lyon, spoke of in the flzte of Vermont, and the
manser in which Mr. Lyon bore it. lfe refer
red particularly totwo conversations which took

ftiould infalt him with it it Philadelphia, it ,
iiiould not pnfs with impunity."
Mr. Goodrich, from Conneilicnt, now rose fc
to state what he knew of the fubjefl. His<t*f- )
timonv related to what'palTt'd betwixt Mr. Ly- j 0
on, Mr.Otis, Mr. Ghampiin and himfelf, in I rÂ£
' the stage from New-York to this city, which
had reUtion principally to Mr. Lyon's having
j bean caihiered, and his havings worn the ivooi- a !
â I en f vjord, which he himfelf had, in a. great de- â
gree, voluntiriiy given them an account of.
Mr. Ch'amplin, from Rhode-lllasd. was next
i called npoii ; but, upon hi s declaring that hiseVi
de.-ice was exactly to the fame qffcS with that jui
delivered by Mr. Goodrich, he did fiot think li
ncccffary. to take up the time of the committee
witli delivering it, and hoped he ihould be excused.
The committee excused him.
Mr. Lyon understood general Sumpter, from
South-Carolina, could give some information to
the committee ;he ceqaefted therefore, he might '
be (worn. â
Mr. Sumpter declared he knew nothing of (he
htiQnefs, except what he had heard from Mr. Lyon
soon aftÂ»r the affilir happened.
After some observations, however, Mr. Sumter y
was sworn, and proceeded to give a narrative of o
' whit Mr. Lyon fai<! tÂ« hin>; when he was inter
rupted by Mr, Bayard, who declared his evidence
incompetent; as it Â»uas not only htarfay rvideme, j"
but came from one of the parties.' If was argued,
on thebther hand, by MeiTrs. Nicholas and Galla
' I tin, that, it had been dÂ«ubted whether Mr.Lyon t
' j had heard Mr Grifwold when he firft mentioned e
1 the wooden fworij, the Â»vidence of Mr. Sumpter.
. would go to (hew tl-tt he did, ai Mr. Lyon told
him so, immediately after the affair hippened.
It was at length agreed, that that precise quef-
" , t'ron should be put to Mr. Sumpter,viz Whether 1
: j Mr. 1 yon told hinÂ» that he heard Mr. Grifwold i
address him twice on the fubjeit of the wooden c
1 (word ?" which Mr. Sumpter anlwered in the affirj, t
mative. â¢ ,
The Speaker enquired of Mr. Sump er, if hr J
knew the moment at which the insult was commit- 1
ted, and how long time elapf d betwixt chat and j
the petiod at which Mr. had spoken to him 1
1 on the fuhjÂ«S ? .
: Mr.Sumpter declaring he did notknow preciftly
t the time at which the iniult was offered ; but that
1 he believed from the agitation of Mr. I,yon, it was
just before he spoke to him on the fubjefl. I
The Speaker again aflted him, whether he knew
Mr. Lyon did, or did sot, orcosld, or could not,
. have spoken to any other member, before he spoke
. to him ? ' !
t Mr.JSumpter declared he could not be certain of t
this. j

nothing behind, as has been somewhere hint
