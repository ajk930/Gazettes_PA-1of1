Sweden, produced and read by Mr. W. Smith
on Monday.
"If in any future war at ft-a, the contracting

observe the (tri<9eft neutrality, then it is agreed,
that if the njerchant (hips of either party (hould
happen to be in a part of the fca, where the (hips
of war of the fame nation are not ltationed, or if
they are met on the high sea, without being able
to have reeourfeto their own convoys, in that ease
the commrnder of the (hips of war of the other

Mr. W Smith, in the debate on Monday, de

declared certain British pouts in the Weft-IndieÂ»
to be inaftate of rexbllion ; it was Victor

FROM THE AURORA.
Philadelphia, May 31, 1797.
felirvj Gtizcns,
THE charge of Judge Iredell to the jury
it Richmond, and tbe consequent prefrntuient
of tayfelf and othersâl have lately read with
every ftntiment of indignation which could be
inspired in the bosom us a free man: If my
countrymen do i:ot feci ihc fame refentmmt it
must be because they live forgotten those fenti
/-ments so favourable to ttt â¢"rcedom of opinion
which a few years ago we fought and bled fur.
The judiciary tnftitutions of the United SfatrÂ»
are valuable only ai they tend to preserve the
piblie pcate and iadividualrigbta, by a regular
andjult execution of the laws :âlf no law has
been violated, there can be no business for th(
federal judiciary, and it is jis yet a feature o:
liberty Â«tenjoy, that no law has anad* it cut
pablc to entertain oi'to express our opinions ei
ther in mattcrÂ»|c.f rePjicn pr pclitics ; It l.as,
Lowcver, keen a regular practice cf the t'cJtial
juries, lo politic*! dlfcotirfesto th; gran.!
juror* throujjuout tht United Stares : They
hove become a band of political preachers, iti
(tcad ofa fags body to.ailminiller the law
The/ do not complain at violations of, any law
and point out the true courts: of redrefÂ», hut
tbry complain of opinions whkti they seem to
think tend to defeat their system of polities ;
the next thin# T fappofe will be, their system
of religion. They Item to be making use of
their power and influence both personally 3nd
officially to controf the freedom of individual
opinion, and these tilings excite a fu4fiÂ«i<Â»
that if they are continued, the time -wiil tome,
when men of different political and religious
Jentiroents from the judges, will n;t find that
e&fy access to jwftice which .those of diflerent
opinions may expeift. the impropriety
of these kindsof charges to jurors as they are a
depai jure from the immediate prov ; nce of the
judgesâ they (hew a political influence ovet the
judges by the executive, which is calculated to
do irretrievable harm. Judge Iredell's charge
at Richmond not only countenances these re
marks, but will give rife to the most serious
train of reflexions, that can engage tht mind
ef any man devoted to the friedfcm of opinion
âThe jury who adted under this charge, ap
pear by their presentment to have considered it ,
as an authority lor censuring the kidepeiidenct
of private opinion. They have pretexted as a
real evil the circular letters of several members
of Congress, without name, and particularly
mine by name, because they differoinatc un
funded calumnies against the government,
tending to fiparate the people from it, and in
creafc or produce a foreign influence. If theft
letters contained calumnies that were illegalâ
if they produced, or increased a foreign influ
ence in our country contrary to law, the au
thors were fit fubje&s for a presentment and
for punilhment. The omission to present the
authors as culprits, and confining prefer.tmrnt
to the opinions contained in the letters, afford
the molt unanswerable proof that these letters
were not the evidences of any illegal ?.<sl ; if
they were, neither the court or jury seem to
have undcrftood the proper manner of doing
theirduty ; if they were not they have judici
ally animadverted upon the freedom of opinion,
with ; view either to suppress it, or to coun
terafl its beneficial cffe&s. At a distance from
my cpnftituents, charged with their bell inter
ests, and bound to give them such information
relative to their public concerns, as I peffeffed,
I never before knew it was criminal to execute
this duty. If I have written fall'ely u i.h a
.view to deceive my countrymen, why did not
this enlightened jury Hate the fails which I have
milVeprelented ? I could then have acquitted
myfelt by the proofs I possess ; but when they
attack my political opinions, which are but the
result of faifts, they do but oppose opinion to
opinion. If they can draw better conclusions
from all nsceffary evidence relative to the points
upon which I have spoken than myfelf, they
' should have presented to you that course of rea
soning by which they were fatisfied, and thus
by addressing themlelves to your judgments
have fatisfied you in opposition to the opinions
which I have given j but this would not have
anfwereJ' their purpose. They were armed
with an awful power, arid a naked presentment
mer.t succeeding a political charge from the
bench was better calculated to overawe than a
manly course of argument. 1 need not fay -to
my fellow-citizens, that I love my country and
will support itsgovernment, upon the principles
of a freeman : âI do not believe any branch of
it. administrators is infallible, and whenever
they appear to me to incroach on the principles
which are necessary to support our freedom and
independence, I will continue to ait the part of
a watchful centinel at the poll where you have
placed me : a charge that I was attempting by
my letters to produce, or increase a foreign in
fluence definitive of my country's inurcfl,
seems to be but the result of an aft too often
and too fuccelsfully used by those who are medi
tating the objeifl they prafcribe, while by a
larms they are diminishing the afleftion of the
public towards a mrtfok-they dread, they are
but secretly making way for a new attachment
towards a nation they love ; and in proportion
as they can succeed in the firft view, they are
sure in the course of humap events of obtaining
their wilhes in the latter view. Look at the
names of the grand jury who have made this
unexampled presentment although you will find
some native Americans who have been attached
tÂ© the independence of their country, you will
readily perceive what they mean by foreign
influense I, like you, my fellow citizens, c.Â»n
have no views of this fort. I have felt, and I
Hill do feel, an attachment for the- French na
tion : They aflifted my country to eftabliih its
independence, and they aided us in securing
peace .â¢ They have founded a republic on the
overthrow of monarchy and tyranny ; I there
fore feel interested in their favour : I look with
a friendly eye on their faults, but I admire iheir
heroism and military prowess. Still if that na
tion or any other on earth, /hall invade the in
dependence and freedom of my country, I lhall
view the attempt as an independent American
It is Britilh influence that we have molt to
dread. In proportion as our eommerce and in
tercourse with England has become more neces
sary to them, by the events in turope, a stron
ger desire has been manifested to stop ourin
tercourfe with France and engage it in favor of
Great Britain. Whenever our commerce has
turned in favor cf Fraoce, England has oppres
sed it; whenever it has turned in favor of Eng
land, France has oppressed it. Our commerce
has become a fubjeth of contest between these
two nations .â¢ It is injured and oppreft by both.
England was appeased for a momsnt by Mr.
Jay's treaty â¢â¢ As a neutral nation we are bound
to place France on the fame footing .â¢ But the
occasion has offered a favourable oppoitunity to
England, to irritate us with France, and France
with us, with a view to eftabliih an incurable
quarrel, the c'onfequencr of which mult be a
compete monopoly of us and our interests by
Great Britain.âlr. this view it it that alarms are
spread about French influence ; for if a quar
rel can be insured between France and Ameri
ca, no moral truth can be more true, than this
political one, that the United States will be
thrown into an alliance offenfive and defenlire
with Great Britain. My wilhes and my de
terminations have always been to maintain the
neutrality of the United States, and regardless
of the interest of other nations to keep free from
conned! ing our national fortunes with those of
any European power.âFor tlitfe things and
for these endeavours my opinions have been
held tip by a grand jury at Richmond as derog
atory to the lappinefsand peace of my country :
You my fellow citizens will view this attempt
to influence opinion with the indignation it de
fcrvei, and I promie yon molt Cncerely it fliall
not intimidate me from pursuing the fame

CONGRESS.
HOUSE or REPRESENTATIVES,
Delate on Mr. Kittera'-t Motion.
FRIDAY, JUNE 2.
A communication was received from the
Treasurer of the United States, with his ac
counts up to the jift. of March lad, which
was ordered tp be printed.
The hotife again entered upon the con
lideration of the answer to the President's
speech ; when the Speaker having Rated the
question under discussion at the time the
house last adjourned, viz. the previous ques
tion upon the motion of Mr. Kittera, for
inserting a clause in the address in reference
to the spoliations committed upon our fellow
citizens. #
Mr. J. Williams expressed his concern
that this motion had been brought forward
at all. In order to extricate the house from
the difficulty, he had proposed tÂ» insert the
word " justice," which he believed would
' '.ave had the desired effeft. He did not
think it was-the business of that house to
take into confidergtion the lofTes sustained by
our merchants from the spoliations of the
French ; if they .chose to run rifles, they
mull take the consequences. But the ques
tion having been brought before the house,
if it were negatived our merchants would
have a claim upon government for their loss
es. He wilhed,-therefore, to have kept the
subject out of fight, since our citizens would
not like to be taxed to pay for these spolia
tions.' It was the opinion of one part of
the house, that tbe propcfition for placing
France on an equal footing with other na
tions would have the effeft to preserve us in
peace ; he wilhed, therefore, that it (hould
go out unclogged. He hoped the mover
would withdraw his motion ; he thought it
would be a conciliatory step, and his propo
sition, he was of opinion, would answer ev
ery purpose.
Mr. Sew all would not have troubled the
house on this question, but that part of his
constituents being interested in the question,
he felt himfelf called upon to make a few
remarks upon it. If this motion had not
been brought forward, he himfelf (hould
have thought it his duty to have introduced
something of the fort, since the former a
inendment was carried. He did not think
with the gentleman last up, that the bare
admitting of the question would pledge them
to pay for the spoliations. He was of opin-
I ion that merchants carrying on trade, under
the fanftion of the government, were enti
tled to proteftion and to be shielded from
insult every where ; but he did not under
stand that this proteftion went to the mak
ing good of losses, but only to protest them
with the public force in their defence. The
injuries committed against them might, in
â¢deed, be so great as to be a just cause of
war, or of a partial war of retaliation, or for
a call upon the nation committing the injury
for redress. It had been denied, when the
former question was under consideration,
that they were dictating any terms to the
executive ; it was then said that they were
only about to offer him their opinion ; but
now, when only a single article was to be
added in behalf of our fellow-citizens, it is
said to be an ultimatum. This was chang
ing of ground; and brought the amendment,
which he did not think very hurtful before,
to give them the power of making peace or
war in the country ; we might force the ex
ecutive and Senate into a war against their
inclination. The constitution had provided
otherwise ; the executive was to take mea
sures for preserving peace. This was fuf
ficient to (how the absurdity of their under
taking the bufinefs.âlf, said Mr. S. .gen
tlemen refufe to consider the question, .it
will be adding insult to injury upon our fel
low citizens. A treaty without this stipu
lation would be absurd. Were the Prcfi
dent to go on with the idea that that the on
ly suggestion in this answer was the ground
on which he was to go ? If so, and he were
to do any thing more, and war were to be
the consequence, he would have to bear the
opprobrium. Gentlemen said they had no
objection to thus amendment, provided it was
not an ultimatum ; h? had no idea that it
could be so considered. It was the more
hazardous, since (as he before observed) he
believed that no steps that they could take
would secure peace. With refpeft to the
consistency ps members who voted against the
former amendment, from constitutional scru
ples, voting in favorof this, he always held
it good, that when a measure was carried
contrary to their wishes, they ought to en
deavor, in justice to themselves and their
constituents, to prevent the thing from do
ing injury as much as possible ; and, upon
this ground, he (hould vote for the main
question, and against the previous one.
Mr. Williams (after leave was obtained
to speak a second time to a previous ques
tion, which was obtained by every member
whofpoke twice on this question) observed
that there seemed to be a difficulty in so a -
mending the address, as to attend to the
claims of their fellow citizens, without ap
pearing to impair their desire for peace. In
order to promote conciliation in the house,
he (hould move tc recommit the address and
amendments to the feleft committee who
prepared it, apd if he were fuccefsful, he
(hould move to add some new members to it..
The motion was put and negatived, there
being 0n1)*Â»24 votes in favor of it.
Mr. S. Smith.said that, in the language
of Mr. Barras, they presented a novel spec
tacle to the world. They had been called
together by the President to do.some aft,
but they were wafting that time which (hould
be employed in ejfeftual measuresâhow ?-
To get clear of what he could not tell how
to get dear of, without a recommitment.
The objeft of calling congress together
was to take into consideration the spoliations
committed upon our commerce, and the in
dignities (hewn to our. miaifter. They had
proofs of the latter faft, but none of the
former. He had mentioned this the other
day, when the secretary of state was pref
ent, expe&ir.g that he would have remedied
the deficiency. He would again fay, that
when Brililh spoliations was the fubjeft of
complaint, they haddosuments before them.
At present they had none, for the repre
sentations made by Mr. Skipwith long ago,
and which were in a train of set dement,
could not now be the objeft, but' (omething
recent. He wiftred to know whether theif
were irregular depredations, or regular'-cap
tures. They had-been teld of certain claims
of our merchants. He asked w'rat they
were. It was true that a number of mer
chants.(and he amongst them) hadrcontraft
ed with M. Fauchet and others to deliver
flour in France, and some of them had got
paid and others'not; Many of their vessels
hadbeen, it was.true, improperly embargo
ed in French ports, for which they had
clairr, si payment, whether it would be ob
tained or not he knew not. He trusted
they were not to go to war to obtain this
payment ; he was persuaded that when the
treasury of France got into a better state
than it was at present that our merchants
would be paid ; but if war was to be gone
into there would be an end of payment. A
mericans,' he said, had been in the habit of
trading to what the French called relet ports,
in the Weft Indies, and, when the French
took our vessels going to those ports, would
it be right to go to war to get redress ? No
neutral power was permitted to trade with
this country when we were declared by Great
Britain to be rebels. Vessels taken in going
to Briti(h islands, in the Weft Indies, would
be looked upon as regular captures, but
those captured in going to rebel ports could
not be expefted to be compensated for. He
knew the French had taken vessels bound to
these regular ports ; but he also knew that
their numbers were small, and that, instead
of twelve millions, it might be found that
there had noe been to the amount of half a
million, or at mod, taken in this way.
And, said he,, (hall we go to war to recover
this ? he trusted not, but that the fame
course would be followed which had been
taken with refpeft to Briti(h spoliations.
At that time a negotiator was sent over to
Great Britain to fettle the business (and a
proper person he was, since it was not always
wife in such cases to fend persons who are
well known to have a friendly disposition for
the nation withwhom they go to treat. ) He
wondered the fee. of state (hould have left
the gentleman from South Carolina to refer
them to Mr. Skipwith's documents. The
man who carried on trade from this country
with British ports (which was mostly the
cafe at Philadelphia and New York) was
fubjeft to French spoliations ; he who trad
ed to French ports was in like manner fub
jeft to the spoliations of the British. Both
countries plundered us. (Mr; Harper wi(h
ed to have interrupted Mr. Smith ; but Mr.
S. would not give way, he said, to a man
who had told him, the other day, he knew
what he was going to fay better than he did
before he uttered his words. Besides, he
knew it was the practice in country courts
to endeavor to. confufe a speaker by interrup
tion, but he had been too long in public life
to be thus affefted.) .
The Speaker said, any member'had v a
right to call another to order. Mr, H. said
he did not mean to call the gentleman to or
der ; then, replied the Speaker, " You, Sir,
are out of order."
Mr. Smith proceeded; - He said tie.had
lately seen papers, which he meant to lay
before the secretary, of .state, from which he
found.that orders.had been issued in April
last by admiral Harvey and general Simcoe,
for taking all American Vessels bound for
Hifpaniola, and to carry- them into Cape
Nichola Mole. . H e ' had mentioned on a
â former Cccafion, the manner in which col.
Talbot had' been treated by the Britifli ad
miral, the gentleman from South Carolina
r,t thar time apologized for his conduft, by
faying colonel Talbot had behaved improp
erly, He no'jv informed that gentleman,
that so far from this colonel Talbot was not
permitred"tbswi to the admiral.
âThe indignity (hewn to our minister, Mr. â¢
S. said, seemed to be more dwelt upon than
the spoliations. But, suppose, said he, we
were to complain to the French government,
might not M. De la Croix fay " What In
jury has been done to you ; your minister
could n<jt diplomatically be received, since
our minister has been recalledâyou have
merely mistaken an article in diplomatic pro
ceedings." Suppose this were found to be
the cafe. The complaint would then only
be, " You did not (hew a fufficient degree of
politeness to our minister." The answer
might be, " We told him he might remain
amongst us fubjeft to the fame laws with
other ftrangcrs." And surely, said Mr. S.
we who are tenacious of our own laws,
(hall not refufe to refpeft those of other
countries. He confeffed he was no diplo
matic man, but he supposed this might be
the course such a complaint would take.
With refpeft to the previous question, it
appeared to him when principles had been
folly determined upon, and an attempt was
made to set them alide, this was the best way
of preventing the measure. . If the gentle-,
men who supported -the- proposition would
vote fur the whole, when amended he would
alfo-vote for it ; if not, he would vote for
the previous question j beeaiife he did not
like tricking.
Mr. Otis said-he was not deterred from
giving his opinion 011 this fubjeft, from the
high refponfibiifty which was attached to it;
he hoped that the previous question would
not prevail, but that the main question
would be put. If they were brot to a- dcci
fion on this question, it was.not the fault of
gentlemen on his fide. It appeared to him,
there could only be three realons for wi(hing
to postpone a decision on the main question ;
they Were, thq.t gentlemen were ready to
abandon the spoliations altogether, or that
it was inexpedient to enti?- into the discussi
on of them at present, or they were- r.ot pre
pared to enter upon it. With refpeft "to the
firft, he could Jnot believe any gentleman
wiihed seriously to give up the claims. As
to the fecoÂ«'', he believed it weald have
Wren expolieut, if they had net gfcne ob
tain kngtha ; but, if they wfire to dictate
to the.Prelident one set of terms, he wifheil
to add something to them which would ren
der them left exceptionable. But this was
called a war proposition, a trammelling of th:
Executive. A war proposition ! fiiid Mr. O.
a" redress of wroHgs ! Was it
ever' cr'niinal to, express a hope i Hope, the
confutation of the. Wretchedâ-Hope, whicli
tt>e nmlefactor at the bar may entertain with
out affronting his judge! If this were the
cafe, we werfsfthe last extremity of //Â«.
vtiTiatithk â  Brit 'ft would trammel-the Exe
cutive. If it were not a ferioiis' fubjeft,
said he, any man-help, fmiijag, that
the fe men who -haVe advocated the equality
clavfe, should complain of this., If gentle
men'," addfcd M?l 0. will knock down the
Executive, on one' fide and the other, it
would be . necefftry for him to have a prop,
at some future period, tOi support himfelf,
either, by.meansof corruption or byforce!
But, he believed, if<they did not encroach
upon his prerogatives, he would be able to
support himfelf."
But gentlemen were unprepared to meet
the queflion. Why unprepared ? Because
we want documents. But, added he, sup.
pose there were no evidence,, or that the faft
was not true, where would be th* -danger of
hoping redress ? What member of the Ex
ecutive Directory could: complain of this ?
It would only be a vain hope, such as they
were many of them m tKe habit of making,
and which he had sifver heard were insult
ing. But would the gentleman from Mary
land go back to B.shimore and fay there
were no documents ? Were there not de
predations committed, and at this hour com
mitting upon the property of his conftftu
ents ? They would not permit him to doubt
on the fubjeft ; -they would fjy to him,
" look at the tears of the widows and chil
dren ; our injuries flare everyone m.[he
face ; they are kit in the heart of evtrv
man." ..
Another reason for- addi.ig tin's* clati/f *;
he did-sot decide that compenlation ana een
ceffion fh<jukl go hand in hand, Jbut..he
would riot decide the contrary ; and if-tfcey
were called upon-to respond one part offlie
speech, and-not the other, they would-be
understood to fay, they should not' go hand
in hand ; for according to a legal majfim,
the designation of one tÃihg wa; the excln
fion of another." He believed it would be
seen by this vote, therefore;, who were- the
friends of the merchants, and who were not.
He denied that there was any trap intended
by this question. He profeifed it his inten
tion to vote for both propofition^."
Mr. Gallatin said the question hadaf
fumed fomewlwt of a different shape fmce
yesterday, as several gentlemen had expreflfed
their intention of voting fpr both 'proposi
tions, I his would have induced ham-to
vote for the amendment, for the- - fake <if
conciliation, if he had not strong.objections
to it; therefore, when he ftated'his reasons
for voting against the main question,, he did
it that they might be anfwerdd, if they were

Gentlemen need not to" have told them
there'was no degradation 4fi'eXprefiing a

an unnecessary thing. ButtHe- amendment

He considered it in the shape of an ultima--

it would produce accommodation If that
disposition was not found eh the part of

This appeared to him to.be the literal mean

tioned several collateral rqafons for Believing

Being, however, a doubtful thing, was a fuf

the fame thing to fay they would not take

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
TUESDAY, JUNE 6.
The Speaker having taken the chair,
â¢Mr. W. Smiti: moved the order of the day
do the bill from the Senate for preventing
â the exportation of arms and ammunition
from the United States.
Mr. Nicholas hoped they should take
isp the unfinifhed business of yesterday, as
' having a priority of claim.
After a good deal of conversation on the
fufejeft, in the course of which each infift
â¢â¢Cd upon the propriety of taking up tfie
melfure he advocated* as calling for the moil
jjÃthediate attention, the motion was put
for taking lip the unfinifhed business of yes
terday, and negatived, there being 42 for
it, and 48 agajnft it. The speakers in favor
of going into a committee of the whole on
1 the State of the Union were, Messrs. Ni
cholas, Varr.um, S. Smith, Giles, Gallatin,
Baldwin and Livingfton ; those agairift it,
â¢ and in favor of taking up the bill from the
. Senate in preference, Meflrs. W. Smith,
Rutkdge, Sewall, Brookes, Otis,andThatch
:tr.
â¢The motion for going into a committee of
the whole 00 the State of the Union, hav
ing been negatived,
Mr. W. Smith renewed his motion for
taking up the bill from the Senate for pre
venting the exportation of arms and ammu
nition.
Mr. Livingston moved toftrike out the
words " one year" so as to confine the du
ration of the bill to the end of the next ses
sion of Congress, which motion, after some
objections from Mr. W. Smith, on the
ground of delay, as the bp was already
engrossed, was carried 43 to 40.
Mr. Lyon wiftied to strike out the words
cannon and bombs, as he thought if the ex
portation of these articles were prohibited,
jt would confidently injure the manufactu
rers of them, and there could be no doubt
but a fufficierit quantity might always be
commanded fqr the use of theUnitedStates.
Mr. S. Smith thought this amendment
of some importance, as he believed there
was not more than one mar. in the State of
Maryland, who knew how to bore a cannon ;
and if he were taken from the employment
by a law of this kind, it was probable,
whenever the manufactory W33 refurced, he
might not be found.
Mr. Lyon said, it was not altogether
with the fame view which the gentleman
from Maryland had given of the subjeCt,
that he had brought forward the motion.
The New England States, could produce
one hundred men acquainted with the bor
ing of cannon. Every furnace would be
glad to be employed in this business and
as to the carting of balk and (hells, there
was nothing easier. The reason for which
he wifried these articles (truck out was, be.
csufe he did not wish these manufactories to
be deprived of employment.
The motion was put and negatived.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) wished to
make a motion, which he supposed might,
in some degree, effeCt the end proposed by
the motion of the gentleman from Vermont.
It was to ilrike out bombs and cannon balls.
t He did not think there need be any fear oi
the United States falling short of these, as
the single State of New-Jersey, or a single
county of that State, could cast fufficient
to supply the whole world.
Mr. Brookes enquired whether these
were articles exported ? If they were not,
the mention of them could do no harm.
Or, whether these articles and powder were
not purchased for the use of the picaroons
which were so troublesome to our trade.
Mr. Gordon thought if there was no
greater advantage attending a regulation oi
this kind, than that of depriving our ene
mies of these articles which might be used
against us, he thought the provision a good
one.
_Mr. Dayton believed that the operatior
l thiÂ» provision would be the destruCtion
j ,cf these manufactories. In answer to the
gentleman from New-York, he could infortr
him, that many of these articles were ex
ported from Nejv-Jerfey, and from the towr
in which he lived ; but if the exportatior
Â«.fas (lopped for any length of time, the fur
inces would be turned to some other bufi
ness ; and, in fix months from the pafling o
this aft, there would be a greater fcarcit}
of theie articles than if the bill had not pal'
led. An act of this kind might, indeed
' carry an imposing air, and look as if it meant
lo take care of ourselves. If the bill were U
!>.!&, however, he (hould be glad to have
i- pass with this amendment.
Mr. S. Smith observed, that in a for
S't-T law of this kind, bomb j and cannoi
bills were not included. It was a feed wh<
i mported these articles, or for what purpofi
were used ? To lay who exported then
would not be right, as they were cor.tn
hand, and hi could not tell >vhonfed them,
nor v,-as it an objeCt of their enquiry. Pic
caroons had no occasion for them, since they
went along fide veflels and boarded them.
The fame argument which was used against
exporting these articles, might be used a
.gainst the exportation of provisions.
Mr. W. Smith said the bill was predica
ted upon being an injury to manufacturers ;
nor did he know why they (hould make an
exception in favor of one more than another,
which would give iuft cause of complaint.
The Qperat.on of "Vie bill, fir.ce the amend
ment had been carried, would be of (hort
duration. The objeCt of it was two-fold,
viz. to preserve these articles in this Coun
try, to be ready in cafe of emergency, and
to keep them from foreign powers, â  who
might turn them against us. Though we
had no occasion, at present, for cannon
balls,, we could not help looking forward to
the time when they tnight be wanted ; and
though nobpmbs were at prefentufed against
us, yet the time might probably arrive, when
they might be so used, and it was politic to
guard against the poflibility of it.
Mr. Brookes faid,though this law might
operate an injury to manufacturers, yet he
did not believe it would be so great as had
been supposed, as the places where these
were cast, were not wholly employed in this
business, but cali also innumerable quanti
ties of hollow ware, as well as metal in
pigs ; when they wsre not, therefore, em
ployed in manufacturing articles for the de
(lruCtion of mankind, they were employed
in making such as were of use to them.
Mr. Nicholas said, this subjeCt had ta
ken a much more serious fliape thau it aflum
ed when it was firft introduced. It seemed
as if it were not so much the intention of
the law to regulate our own wants, as to
prevent thf. supply of Foreign Powers, â
with warlike articles. This, he said, might
be attended with very serious incotivenien
| cies, since it would certainly operate princi
pally against one of the belligerent powers ;
and except we are prepared and determined
i upon war, we (hould be careful in provoking
it. It was conceded that there was no pro
bability of our wanting bombs or cannon
balls, the operation of the law was of course
; intended against ope of the belligerent pow
ers ; for though both had an equal right at
! present to come here and purchase these ar
ticles, even' one would fee that France
would be principally affeCted by the regula
tion. It would be little (hort of hostility,
| therefore, to fay these articles (hould not be
exported. Indeed, he feared there was
more in this business than the Committee
' understood ; that they were taking a ground
I which could not be maintained, and which,
pending a negociation, ought not to be ta
j ken.
| Mr. S. Smith said, he believed that
1 some of the manufacturers of cannon ball?
might be maufaCturers of hollow-ware, for
he understood there was an 'aCtion now pen
ding on account of their a par
cel of cannon balls hollow, which had burst
the cannon in which they were fired, and
â  done other mifchief.
Mr. Lyon believed the gentleman from
New York was not well acquainted with
the business. Hollow-ware and pigs were
not cast at the fame furnaces with bombs
and cannon balls. Many furnaces worked
with oor which though not fit for pigs, &c.
answered very well for cannon balls and bomb
(hells. In his diltriCt there was several of
these manufactories, which exported many
of these articles into Canada. He trusted
gentlemen would not have the fame objec
tion so fending them thither, that they had
to fending them to French ports.
Mr. Thatcher thought this law could
give no nation cause of complaint, because
the articles were contraband, and it would
perhaps have the good effeCt to prevent the
loss. of some of our own velTels, employed
in carrying them..
Mr. Harper thought the objection of
the gentleman from Virginia deserved some
conlideration. No meaiure of defence had
been, or seemingly could be mentioned, but
it was said it might give offence to France.
I He a(ked how long we were to be deterred
I from taking such meafurss as (hould seem
to be necessary, for fear of offending France.
If we were not to take general meafurcs foi
the protection of our citizens, because there
might be a poflibility France would not ap
prove them, where was the humiliation to
ltop ? He supposed we (hould next be told
that we mult not fortify, our ports, or arm
our veflels, left it (hould be offenfive to
France. He trusted that House would no
i longer hold so difgraceful a language, but
that they (hould consult what would be foi
our own good, without reference to any fo
reign nation. Our Government, he-observ
ed, had not said it would never prohibit the
exportation of arms and ammunition. The
| English had been permitted to purchase
these articles, of which the French com
plained, and equal liberty was given to both
nations ; but this was no reason why botl
nations might not be prohibited from doinj:
so, if it (hould be found expedient. Ant
j though he did not believe that all the advan
tages which were expeCted, would be deri
-j ved from this law, yet he (hould be in favou:
1 of it, not because it would not offend a so
reign nation, but because it would be fer
viceable tq ourfelvea ; for, he said, if the;
were to go on, in consulting the feelings o
,'J the French nation on what they did ; if the;
saw us thus prostrate and feeble, they woulc
. soon take advantage of our timidity an(
folly. On the contrary, he would (hew so
reign nations that we were determined ti
â  regulate our own affairs in our own way, ii
the way of juitice ; for, if we went on ii
the present humiliating way, he fliould no
1 be surprised at receiving a note from th
French Miniiter, faying that such and fuel
a law must be repealed, as they were offen
. five to the French. Directory.
1 I Mr. Dayton, thinking himfelf allude
1 to by the gentleman just fat doWA, proceed
ed to a(k if he ftleant to insinuate that h
1 was aCtuated by other motives than the goo
of his country, when Mr. Harper interrupt
cd lum ,by faying expressly, he had never
intimated any such thing. His remarks be
ing confined to the gentleman from Virginia, i
Mr. Nicholas said he would tell the '
gentleman from South Carolina when he '
would cease to hear this clamor about offend
ing foreign countries. It would be when he r
found a greater disposition in all the depart- j
ments of government for preferring the peace !
of this country ; when he was Convinced
they ha d as great a desire to preserve this
blefling as he had. He did not believe this
was the cafe at present; and it was from this
distrust, that he fufpefted every measure
which was brought before them. Was he
not juftified he a iked, in faying that a mea
sure of tliis kind was calculated to remove
peace from us, as it was a measure which
would operate wholly (as he before slated)
against the French. Mr. N. said he dis
dained to answer what the gentleman had
said about fear. It could not be found in ,
him : and he thought that gentleman was ,
possessed of no small degree of assurance to ,
fancy that he ( Mr. N.) was less attached ,
to the interests of this country than he him- â 
felf was. He felt as sensibly for his country (
as any man ; and therefore he could not help
cxpreffing his apprehensions of war, from
every step which gentleman seemed inclined
to take.
Mr. Brookes did not expeÂ£t the argu
ment to have taken this turn. There was |
nothing to prove that thefc articles were not (
as necessary for our own fafety as the other.
It had been said they wera call in plenty iri t
one part of the Union, but they might not â¢
be call at all in ofher parts. He disclaimed
all idea of considering how the measure would (
affeft any other nation ; he attended only
to his own, and he believed they were at li
berty to prohibit the exportation of any ar- (
ticle whatevev.
Mr. Gallatin said the gentleman just
fat down had forgotten his own arguments.
He charged others with having reference to (
foreign nations, in fpeakir.g to this question, .
when he and the gentleman from South Ca
rolina were the firft to introduce the mention
of them ; it was them ; it was therefore j
not right in him to charge others with doing
what he himfelf had done.
Mr. Brookes replied that he had said no- (
thing about foreign nations.. It was true .
he had supposed the Picaroons which inter
cepted our Weft India vessels might have ,
been served with these articles ; but gentle- !
men had denied that these were authorized , (
by France.
Mr. Lyon would have no obje&ion to i
join the gentleman last up in withholding
these articles from the Picaroons, if his con
stituents might be fuffered to transport their
manufactures down the Lake to Canada.
Mr. Havens said, it appeared as if those
gentlemen who opposed the amendment, be- .
lieved we could monopolize all the bombs :
and cannon balls. He believed Piccarooris :
could get these things independent of us,
and that we need be under no apprehension
of wanting them ourfelvÂ£s.
Mr. Harper believed there was policy
in preventing the exportation of implements ;
of war which might be turned against us. !
He did not accuse the gentleman from Vir
ginia with personal fear ; he believjd he was
incapable of it; but he doubted whether his
zeal for serving his own cpuntry would be so
great as he profeffed, when the interest of
another country happened to clash with that,
of his own.
Mr Dayton referred to a former pro- '
hibition law, to fnew tbat cannon balls were
â  not included in the lift. He believed they
I might make the proposed prohibition with- j
out giving just cause of offence to any foreign 1
[ nation, and therefore if they were offended
: we need not care ; but if the only "objeft was â 
! to preserve a larger quantity of these articles
in this country (is he had before observed) j
[ the end would be defeated, as it would both '
discourage the manufacturing and importa
f tion of them ; but as it would have an ap
: pearance of an intention to defend ourselves
[ against the unjust attempts of any Fo
t reign Nation, if the amendment was agreed
. to, he should vote for the resolution ; and
1 if it were not, he had not determined to vote
1 against it.
Mr. Williams wished this aft to be
r conformable to that passed in. 1794, which I
; had been attended with good effe&s. He
- therefore moved that the amendment (hould
> be divided.
1 The question wasdividedaccordingly, and
i the sense of the committee was firft taken u
) pon striking out the wordâ" bomb Jhells,"
> which was negatived, there being 41 votes
t for it, and 45 against it. The question
r was then taken upon striking out the words
- " cannon balls," and carried, there being 52
- votes in favor of it.
: The committee thenrofe and reported the
1 bill as amended. It was taken up in the
; house, the amendments confirmed and or
- dered to be engrossed for a third reading this
1 day, which it afterwards received ; but from
1 an obje&ion as to the propriety of the word
r ing of the penal clause, the palling of it was
i postponed until to-morrow.
On motion of Mr: W. Smith, the house
- resolved itfelf into a committee of the whole
r on the bill from the Senate to prevent citi
-- zens ofthe United Statesprivateering ageinft
- nations in amity with, or against citizens of
y the United States. After some cativerfati
f on on this bill, particularly as to its opera
y rion, whether it (hould affedl only Ameri
i can citizens concerned in armed vessels fitted
d out by private persons, or whether it should j
1- affeft all citizens employed in any foreign
o service in cruising against the vessels of the
n United States, upon which fubje&s there
n appeared a considerable variety of opinion,
it* the bill was re-committed to a felett com
e mittee of five members, in order to be put
h into a somewhat different form.

The minister ofjthe marine and the colonies
to the principal commissary of the marina
at Havre.
" You have done well, citizen, in disa
vowing, in tlie maritime Journals, the report
which had prevailed, that the French go- j
vernment had given an order to seize the

This falfe news, like many other reports, is
the fruit of the manoeuvres of malevolence,

Peace, peace, fays a Paris paperâThis is
the with of every one in France, who retajns
a particle of humanity.
On the 2d of April, it was reported in
Paris, that a courier had arrived in four days
from Turin, to Mr. Spinola, the Genoese
minister, with intelligence that the prelimi
naries of peace had been signed by the mar
quis of Lucchini, Austrian minister in Italy,
and general Clarke. The principal condi
ditions were said to be, the cession of Belgi
um to France by the emperor, and the ces
sion to the emperorby the French, of all their
conquests in Italy, comprehending the three
legations taken from the pope.
This news was not fully credited. But
fays the Paris editor, " Let us hopeâhope
is the sweet consolation of the wretched.â
But peace in the interiorâGreat God 1
When lhall we have it ?"
An article from Vienna mentions, that
propositions for peace had actually been
made by the French to the emperor, which
held out to him an indemnification in Italy
for Belgium; in consequence of which a
council of state had been convened, to which
some ambassadors of the powers in amity
with the emperor had been invited.
A letter from Frankfort, of March 17,
states, that from the'campaign of 1792, to
that of 1796, the Auftrians had 9 generals
killed, and 20 wounded ;.1166 officers kill
ed and 2005 wounded ; 37,803 under offi
cers and soldiers killed , and 86,216 wound
ed.
The French took from captain Glad his
vessel, and turned her into a privateer, with
out ceremony. They did not even alii his
permission.
Thomas Paine was to have taken passage
to America in the Dublin Packet, from Ha

1794, having this day constituted tUeir Board,â
purliunt and agreeabiy to the laid treaty, do here
by Â£ ive notice, that they are ready to proceed tÂ»
business accordingly; and they defiro that all claims
under the said article (which so far as the fame de
ferikes the cases thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
They further delire that all such claims may not
oni/ftate in what manner the several cases come
within the deferiptioa of the said article, but also
cfpccially ftt forth vhe nature of the evidence by
which the claimants refpeitivcty undertake tofub

Exjradl from the said article,
" Whereas it is alledgcd by divÂ«rs Britilh mer
" chants, and others his majcft\ s fubje^ts, that
" debts to a confid-rablo amount, which were bona

*â¢ rious lawful impediments, fifice the peace, D3t
â¢' only the fuil recovery of the said debts has been
Â«â¢ delayed, but alfothe value and security thereof
" have been in several instances impaired and jeff
" ened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial
" proceedings, the Britilh creditors cannot now
" obtain and a<stually have and receive full and
" adequate compenlation for the lofftn and dama
" ges which tney have thereby fuf ained: It is a
" greed that in all such cases where full compenfa
Â«â¢ tion for such losses and damages cannot for what
â¬* ever rcafon be a&uully obtained, had and recei
Â« ved by the said creditors in the ordinary course
Â« of justice, the United States will make full and
" complete compensation for the fame to the said

* l this proviiion is to extend to such losses only as
" have been occasioned by the lawful impediments
Â« aforcfaid, and is not to extend to losses occalion
" ed by such infolvcnty of the debtors or other

41 WILLIAM PENN, the great legislator of the
Quakers, (in Pennsylvania) had the success of a con
queror, in efhblilhing and defending his colony v a
mong savage tribes, without ever drawing the sword ;
the goodness of the molt benevolent rulers, in trea- j
ting his fubje&s as his own children ; and the tender
ness of an universal father, who opened his arms to
all mankind without difhnltion ot feft or partv. In
his Republic it was not his religious creed, but per
lonal merit, that entitled every member of society to
the prote&ioa and emolument of the State*"
