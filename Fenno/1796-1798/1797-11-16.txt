' ST R,
The inhabitants of the city of New-
Brunfwick, and its vicinity, are highly grat
ified with the opportunity of ex pr effing to
you their affe&ionate esteem.
Happy in a government of laws, and hap--
py hi the administration of it under the great
and good Wafhinjrton, we could not but
sincerely rejoice, when the voice of our coun
try, upon his retirement, gave us for a
Chief Magiftratc, a person whose past ser
vices had endeared him tu bis country, and
vrho e political principles enfurcd h m the
Confidence of his fellow-citizens.
The sentiments, Sir, which you have dis
closed refpeÂ£ling the duties of the United
States, in regard to their foreign relations,
while they meet with our unequivocal ap
probation, are at the fame time a happy
presage, that the measures which you are
pnrfuing will terminate in the security of
our peace 1 , and in the pret rvation of the
honor and dignity of our national charadter.
Vv'e have herÂ»rd, S'r, the voice of fadtion,
and we have abhorred itâwe have fcen the
progress. of foreign influence, and we have la
mented its pernicious Religion,
morality, and patriotism havs had much to
fearâhut we indulge the pleasing hope,
that be who sways the sceptre of universal
nature, has not destined the people of this
happy country to work out their own def
truftion. _ 5j -j
W.'th us, as Jersey men and citizens of
the United States, we are prompled to de
clare, that a lÂ»ve of order and good govern
ment, a sacred regard to moral reftitude,
and the fame ylmor Patri<e which so indig
nantly recoiled at the idea of foreign domi
nation, dill remain undiminiihed.
May it, Sir, be your happy lot to fee that
the people of this country will rally under
no other standard but their own, in support
of their Constitution, and in defence of the
laws of their country.
May your our govern
ment be long and profpuiaus, and when it
{hall please the great ruler of the univerfeto
summon you into "a more exalted feat of eter
nal bliss, may you, retiring, bid adieu to
your gri'teful country by the pleasing appel

In behalf of the inhabitants of the
vicinity of New-Brunfwick.
To -which the President returned the following
answer..
To the Inhabitants o/"New-Brihjswick
and its Vicinity.
Gentlemen,
The esteem and affeftion of the inhabi
tants of the eity of New-Brunfwick and its
vicinity, expressed in this excellent address,
are very'flattering to me, and cannot fail
to meet with a cordial return of gratitude
on rfiy part.
The happiness you enjoyed in a govern
ment of laws, under the great jind good
W ifhington, was common to you, and all
virtuous men in America. Even the very
fen- who imagined, or pretended they dif
lifced it, could not but be happy under it.
The fatisfadlion you expref* in the choice
of a successor, your approbation of his pail
frrvices, and confidence in his political prin
ciples, demand his moil flrenuous endeavors
to deserve their continuance.
Your approbation of my sentiments of
our foreign relations, and the measures we
are pursuing afTord me miich consolation,
as nothing can contribute so much to suc
cess, the continuanee of peace, and the pre
servation of the honor and dignity of our
national chara&er, as a happy harmony a
mcngjhe people, and their union in fenti
with government.
If the voice of faction has been heard,
and foreign influence has made a progress ;
if religion, morality and patriotism, have
bad much to fear ; we have reason to be
iicve that this has been chiefly due, to fur
pnfe and niifreprefentation, aided by an eu
thufiafm for liberty too ardent, aÂ«d intem
perate. â¢ The progress of enquiry, rnd cir
cti'at'on of true inferm'tion, ve have jreat
rcsfiutto espeft will jrttt our countrymen I
on their gn?rd, promote aa in-p3Jtial spirit enei,
of Independence, a rational fp'rit oi'liberty, thn
and a Tob'Cr'determination to prefcrve their
morals and support their religion, without
which patriotism is but a chimera. the
\ our noble declaration as Jcrfeymen and abh
cftiz<ft*'of the United States in favor or
order, government, morals, patriotism and
religion, does you grt;at honor, and cannot
Mto have a happy influence, and afford a the
great encouragement to fimilnr resolutions fioi
in all parts of the Union. the
Tint it will be your nappy lot as well as
mine, to fee the people rally under their the
own standard, in contempt and de' v ance of cot
allothvrs, in support of their conih'tntion, cot
and defence of their country whenever occa- bei
fion shall require, I have not the smallest? cit
doubt. b'g
In return for your pathetic wishes for tlx
the prosperity of mv administration, and in
for the final completion os- it, moll devout- ani
ly to be wished, by taking my lall leave es
of a happy people, which have tenderly as- the
feiftdd mc, I present you my bell wishes, gl
and' offering up my sincere prayers, for your ex
temporal and eternal felicity. co

>a- GENTLEMEN,
I receive this address from the legislative
iat council and general assembly of New-Jersey
>ve w J t h a grateful sense of the high honor con
fo- f erre d upon me.
As there is no people whose attachment
Met the principles of a free reprefentat've go
vernment has been more constant and con
sistent than that of the citizens of New-Jer
sey, there is none with whom I could more
im- heartily rejoice, that eleftions of a Chief
try Magistrate have been condufted without tur
-10 bulence or tumult ; and may future experi
ence demonstrate, that integrity and ability
"II will always be the objeft of the choice of
ben freemen.
.. Your kind compliments to me, merit my
J best thanks and strongest affurartces, that
" rf (hould any thing in my administration pro
test your interest in common with all those
of your fellow-citizens through the union,
promote harmony and unanimity among the
.., citizens of these states, and friendly senti
ments and intercourse with all mankind, 1
Â° n (hould esteem myfelf the happiest of all men.
In this eventful period, when the equilib
rium of society is difadjufted, and thepaffion3
late ftprtun let locfe, without restraint or con
the troul, in so great a part of the world, it
behoves us well to consider the situation w-e
had arc f n> atu l be prepared in our mindÃ for
whatever we may be called by Providence to
' !"â ' do, or to fuffer, in the cause of honor and
â mly virtue, religion and liberty.
'/"k Your sentiment, that we must not yield to
dishonor, so well becomes the charafter and
dignity of freemen, that it is very certain
â  the there never has been, and equally evident
m:et there never can be, a free people to whom
1. their honor is not dearer than their lives.
As the citizens of New-Jersey have been
ri be, exceeded by none in their attachment to the
constitution, your reliance on the ju 11 admi
nistration of the government, is peculiarly
irtur honorable arid agreeable to mc.
is of Accept, gentlemen, of my cordial thanks

The inhabitants of this town assembled 1
g yesterday, to take into consideration the
;e fubjeft of granting a sum, as additional to '
e- the pay of government, to those men who 1
c- might be drafted in this town, as a part of '
re the detachment of 80, coo militia ordered '
at by Congress. And also to fee whether 1
te they would grant a compensation to the mi
ns Iftia of the town when called out for ordi

be fourteen dollars a month if called into service,
n- and one month's pay in that cafe advanced,
fs The other question, which was founded
ig upon a supposed unjuflinequality in the bur
h- then of militia expenfesj met a cool and can
to did discussion. Every speaker avowed the
"m sentiment on which the question was bro't
)n forward ; but it was doubted whether a
lft vote of pay for that purpose would have a
if- ny validity, if it fliould be disputed when
ig the taxes were assessed and attempted to
ve be collected ; and in this cafe much confu
lion might ensue in the final arrangements of
or the town. The discussion iffucd in the ap
le- pointment of a numerous and refpeftable
he committee, to investigate the legality of
it- making such compensation, and (hould they
ly find it legal, and expedient, to recommend
a certain sum for that purpose, and the ways
and means for raising it, and make report

Particulurs of the Mutiny on board the Bri
. tift Frigate lIE RMIONE.
When about 3 days out from Cape Ni
cola Mole, 011 a cruise, part of the crew
were engaged handing the mizen topsail ;
the captain speaking (harp to them, two of
the men fell from the yards ; when the fl
eers came down they were reprimanded in
harsh terms by the captain, and several of
them threatened with punishmentâthis oc
casioned much discontent, which continued
until the next evening, when the mutiny
broke out, by throwing double headed (hot,
&c. about the fliip, and other disorderly be
haviour, The firft lieutenant went down
10 enquire what they Wanted, and was soon
wounded in the arm with a tomahawk ; he
retired for some time, and when he returned
was knocked down with a tomahawk, his
throat cut, and thrown overboard.âAfter
which the sailors proceeded to the cabin in
search of the captain who had locked him
felf in, but was soon dragged out (after
having wounded 2 or 3 in defending him
felf with his sword) and experienced the
fate of his unfortunate lieutenant : they af
terwards seized npon and murdered every
officei in the (hip, except a mailer's mate,
and two midlhipmen
They then direfted their course for La
Guira, where they arrived under Spanish
colours, and delivered the (hip up to the
Spanish government, giving out that they
had turned their officers adrift in their jolly
boat. The Spaniards have since manned

The council of 500 considering that the

a Letter of the 11 th FruClidor, written by
Adjutant General Moel Huard, to his
n friend at Paris.
0 At length, my dear friend, we can no
J " longer doubt that the emperor has great
~r friends at Paris. When we were at the
?' gates of Venice, he accepted all, and to
'e day he denits himfelf; for ten days past it
appears here, that hostilities will recom
:y mence. General Bnonaparie has reviewed
K ' us, and we are nut left ignorant of the con
s'' 8 duCl of the emperor. All the officers and
rt soldiers replied that they knew the road to
111 Vienna, and that they would try it a second
time. Buonaparte immediately after set out
for Udine, where the council is afiembkd,
for the purpose of obtaining a prompt ex
plication from these mtjfteurs.'
Mr The Journal des Hommes libres announces
' e the discovery of a movement at Bloisâlt
ln fays that from the 20th to the 21ft they had
a report of a courier sent by Carnot to ge
â r* neral Clarke, with dispatches, the objeft of
which was to conclude a peace at any price.
This, without doubt, determined the di
â¢ reftory to order the arreftation of Clarke.

,y The news from Marseilles of the 22d,
fays a journalist is every way unfatisfafto
ry. The national gunrd was formed the
19th, ala Pichegru. The republicans have
not made their appearance ; they would have
been afTaffinated. . All the Chouans and
cut-throats are enrolled. The most famoiu
afiaffins are officers.
1 The city is always guarded ; viz. Part
of the Chouans are encamped without and
have their patroles like a city befiegcd ;
they wait with impatience f<Sr the news
frpm Paris, and threaten daily to carry mta
fures to the last excess, even ftiould they hear
that their party is vanquished, adding* that
j they have no asylum left if tbs 'government
(hould triumph.

COUNCIL OF FIVE HUNDRED.
September 13.
The central administration of Precy de
Done congratulates the councils, that they
hadcrnlhed theroyalift cOnfpirators. You
have declared, fays their address, that the
French armies have deserved well of their
country ; well tl e whole people declare that
you have well deserved their eftcem. Hon
orable mention.
The republicans of Chalons-fur-Marne
write as follows : By crushing the feeds of
royalifm you have well deserved of the
country, &cf.
A member observed that an article of the
law passed on the organization of the gen
darmerie, requires that each private (hall be
nfclq to read and wrirc cvrreS'.y So rigo
rous a condition, he observed, would drive
from their places a croud of decided repub
licans, whose families would be plunged in
to misery. He moved that this subject be
referred to the military committee. Agreed.
The fubjeA of finances was taken up.
The report of a decree was adopted laying
a tax on public carriages for the traufpor
tat'on of pertons of one tenth part of the
hire Â»f such carriages, when they travel at
stated periods, and on public carriages for
the transportation of persons travelling oc
casionally as follows :
Tor a two wheeled carriage with two feats
20 livres per annum.
For a two wheeled carriage with four feats
35-
For a four wheeled carriage with four
fe3ts 40.
For a four wheeled carriage with fix feats
and above, 50. v
A turnpike toll for the receipt of monies
to be exclusively appropriated to the repair
of the highways was also agreed to. The
receipts of each turnpike are to be rented
out to the highest bidder. The plan fs to
b*put in operation on the portions of high-
Ways nearest Paris, and thence to be ex
tended gradually to the frontiers in every
direftion. ,
T'ie eltablifhment of a national lottery
was also decreed.
In the name ci the committee of inspec
tors Cales presented a report on a dress for
the representatives of the people. [lt
Ihould be remarked that the former projeft
of decree on the fuhjeft of a coflume for
the legislature never became a law. J It was
to consist in a blue coat red lining the col
lar and facings embroidered in gold ; gol
den button damped with a balance and iev
cl ; a tricolor fa(h ; a deep red silk cloak
for the elders, and one rose color for the
five hundred, which should fall four inches
lower than the coat. Round hat with a
feather, golden loop.
Chafal conceived this coflume resembled
too much the military dress. He offered
another plan, which he conceived harmo
nized better with that of the directory.
Upon the motion of Coupe tbe council
ordered the printing of the plan of Cales.

of the department of l'AUier, write that tbe

' Jourdan (of Haute Vienne) called the ]
attention of the council to the situation of ,
the wounded defenders of the'eountry, and
the relations of those who had expired in the j
field of honor and of those who still served â¢
under the banners of the republic. He 1
dated, that by the fall of ailignats the com
pensation allowed them by the existing laws
wag merely nominal. On his motion a fpe- (
cial committee was appointed 011 this sub- I
jest. \
Pons (of Verdun) proposed a decree tend- '
ing to annul the prosecutions on foot against I
persons relative to the holding of tha pri
niary assemblies, and to rellore to liberty (
the citizens who had been thrown into pri-
son on the occasion. He moved, that urn
gency he declared and that the decree Ihould (i
pass without delay. , v
Philippe Delville, moved that it be print-
ed, and the consideration adjourned. j
Several members wilhed a queftioti on the v
decree. c
Pons (of Verdun) I am surprised th:;t my
colleague Ihould wish the queftioti adjourn
ed. Docs he not know, that in several of
the departments the republicans are groan
ing in fetters ! In the department of Nievre
alone, which was the head quarters of the 5'
royallHs and chouansthereare more than 20c
who have been thrown into dungeons.â
These faÂ£b are certain, and I hope that n
Delville will cite others as a motive in favour C i
of the adjournment. lr
Philippe Delville wished the delay be-
cause the measure was important, as it
went to interrupt the usual course of justice.
He admitted the facts breught forward by ii (
the reporter ; but thought a delay of 24 ki
hours could not &e pregnant with very bad 151

, The law of the 3Â«->th JVleflidor, which takes
from the Direflory the conftitutiona! right of
making those appointments, when there does
not remain in the administration a of
members fufucier.t to deliberate was repealed.
Adminiflrations of the law now proposed are to
fill up vacancies in their own body only when
they have a rutnberaf members fuffkient to de
liberate ; when they have not, the Diretflory
are to maktt the appointment agreeably to the
conliitntion.
ViLLfas in the name of the Financial Com
mittee called the attention of the council to the
fwbjefl .if the public debt. The tefult of the
fitting tbe committee had held last evening was,
the impoflibihty of I'eparating the two parts of
thrprojedl, that relating to the one third to be
paid ia cash, and that propufing the other two
thirds to be difcliarged hy certificates payable
to bearer, and receivable for national property.
The two parts of theprojeft Ihould go hand in
hand.
Such wai thÂ» result of the deliberations of the
committee; they had also to propose some addi
tional articles difcrimir.ating in favor of final!
creditors.
Jwlion Souhait now fuppr.rted the plan. One
great deftderatum, on which he faiii the com
mittee had agreed, was, tha' the file of nation-'
al property fc; uld b; proccedtd to with vigour.
It served to attach the pin rhafrrs to the repub
lic. Abuses had crept into this department ;
Rut the minister of finance had allured the com- |
mittee that they were owing to the adminiflra
tions which were compoftd chiefly of mtn who
were enemies of the Republic and hindered the
sales ; hutfincethe il'th Fru<Â£tidor, the govern- .
ment will be able tÂ» watcb effectually those ad- ! ,
miniftrators, and things have changed their j
completion. | ,
Rt'i z opposed the proje>sl of decree on the <
ground that it did not do full jtiftice to the cre
ditors The contrafl between the state antl its
creditors could not without violating the firft
principles of justice be infringed. If it was, ail
flab would be given t -public credit. He treat- r
ed as chimerical the idea of redeeming with iv (
tiohal domains the two thirds to be paid nowin t
paper. They might as well talk of the land 6in t
California as those in St. Domingo which re- f
maincd the property of the state. f
ViLLkRs argued, that the projefl did every 1
justice to the creditor which they had in equity '
a right to ex( ecSl, and whu h the Hate was able J
to give. He cited the example of the United
States in favour of this made of compromising I
with the creditors of the state. " You are (
told," he obferved/'that credit will he proltrat
ed." Put how can it fall, when yon will pre
sent to Europe a nation having no debt in com
parison with England, which is weighed down 0
tinder the weight of hers. He hoped the two t
parts of the fubjet wou'd not he put asunder. j,
Fabrf said, We must be just towards the ci- v
tizens of France as well as to the creditors of h
the state. To be just towaids the firft, the le- h
giflature must decree not more taxes than the h
natron can pay. Who will assert that it i* pos
sible to require more than 6ii millions of livres, h
which ate already decreed. Yet this must be tl
done if the creditors cannot be paid with the na- ft
tional domains, and tbe nation cannot pay more. 11
He went on to (hew, that the projefl proposed
was advantageous to the cred'tor and all they v '
could ejtpeil from the state.
The project of the decree was then adopted.

BIOGRAPHICAL ANE6T)O*TE.
In June, 1779, died in England, Mr*. Ross,ce
lebrated for her beauty rnd Constancy. Having
met with oppofiiion in her engagement with capt.
Charles Rofs, (he followed him with men's cloathes
to America : where, after such a refcarch and fa
tigue as scarce any of her sex could! have undergone, I
(he found him in ths woods lying for dead, with a
poiloned wound, after a fkirmifti with the Indians ;
when, having ftudied surgery in Eng
land, 4b e saved his life By fucking h-is wound, and
nursing him with scarce a coveritig, for a space of
fix weeks ; during which time (he remained unfuf
pefled by him, having died her face with lime and
bark : The captain recovering, they removed in
to Philadelphia ; when , as soon as she had found a
clergyman to join her to l.im forever, she appeared
as herfelf, tlÂ»e priest accompanying iu-r.
They lived four years in a fondnefs that could
only be interrupted by her declining health, the fa
tigue (he had undergone, and the poison not pro
perly expelled, which she had imbibed from his
wound, undei mining her conflirution : the know
ledge he had of it, and piercing regret for having
been the occasion, affe&ing him (till more fehfibly,
he died with a broken heart at Jdhn's town.
Fhe lived to return, and implore forgivenefs of
her family, whom she bad dillfcffcd so long by
their ignorance of her delliny. She died, in con
sequence of her grief and attention, at the age of
twenty fix.

! the subtle cruel: y of his charader in a fe- !
1 r:es of wild difcufli )ns and dangerous thco- j
n ries, all tending 'o the overthrow of gene- !
( ral proiperity a;id individual happiness. in e- [
II , very country, he has now consummated h;s j
1 gui't, and given the m'ofl evident proofs of
I the foulnefs of his heart, by the
1 ; last little remnant of imputed patriotism, to
- ' a faithlefs and cowardly attack on his early
â¢ j benefaftor and friend.
j We are not surprized, because we difco
| ver plainly the immediate cause: of the vio
-1 lent change that has dictated the declarati
ons of discontent, and threats of hostility,
, which continue to fill the colurrins of the
French journals, against the firm and pru
dent conduft of tlie American Congress,
- aided by their refpeftable President. It is
- the business of the designing, ill-intention
ed, ambitious leaders of faftion in France,
- under the cloak of liberty, to praftife all
- the arts of calumny, to mislead the people,
r and hurry them into the wildest me ifures.
That iom Paine should seize with avidity
, and with an aflivity, unfortunately in him
s combined with a mod malignant difpofiti-
I on, every channel of inveftive against the
British government, we cannot wonder at. 1
' But that he fliould add to the black cata
-1 , Jogue of his crimes, that of deep ingrati
-1 tude, by aiming to (lab the fame, to mur
der the charafter of the man that cherished
| his political infancy and brought him forward
: into public life, proves that the aflumed garb
J of modern philosophy isbut a fafer covering
for the dagger of the aflfaffin. An eftemy of
Great-Britain by principles of rebellion, by
habits of abuse, by circumilances of political
elev-Â»:on and private interelt, we have seen
~ him dire ft the whole force of his imposing
| talents the specious triek of smooth phrafe
| ol Â°gy. cant of popular prejudices to dis
colour, to traduce the eitablifhed forms of
government and to overthrow the conilitu- 1
tion ofthofc kingdoms : But in his last per
formance, he far out-does his usual out-do
ingsâhe out strips depravity ; and high
over-leaping over-leaps all boundsâfaithful
to his avoWed principles of anarchy and com
motion, he boldly soars to the last and great
est of crimes, ingratitude, and arraigns the
illustrious Waftington for his persevering
and virtuous attachment to the order, the
prosperity of the American States.
In the phrenzy of gallic zeal, he forgets
that he fell a viiftim in his turn to the fury
of fadtion ; and that in despite of his labours
for a series of years in the cause of revolu- j
tionary government, he was consigned to a "
dtwigeon ; and eventually refeued from the I
guillotine, which carried off his fellow-adtors
on the great revolutionary theatre, after
strutting their hour on the bloody stage, on- &
ly by the generous interference of thofc ~
peaceful Americans, whom he now loads
with reproach and obliquy, beeaufe they
will not facrifice individual virtue, and ra
tional wisdom to the insolent dictation of
French partizans and domellic anarchists.
One would have thought that the situation ' W
of distress and fuffering, into which Paine -
was hurried, among the other revolutionary '
heroes of his day, and his narrow escape I
from the gripe of the guillotine, fliould â  1
have checked the racoethes fcrihendi, and gj
awed him from meddling further in politi- w
cal affairs. But it seems that confinement J(
tended only to sharpen the edge of calumny, G
and to point more keenly the fliafts of flan- 1,1
der against all that men are taught to refpeÂ£t
in societyâmorality and religion. The I
moment of his deliverance from prison, was 1
like the opening of pandora's box, marked fc
by the issuing forth of a more pestilential, if]
vapour than what he had before sent into tc
