had been made, and our state iound in debt, and
treating our complaints of errors in that settlement,
ai laughable or ehildilh j when he heard a gentle
man from New-Jersey (Mr. Dayton) dcclarc, in a
serious tone of voice, that no consideration would
ever induce him to relinquish that claim ; although
errors may have exiftej, â itbuugh frauds may have
j|een introduced, although we may have mauy large
and just demands not brought forward at the time
of settlement, notwithstanding all this, it seems
the gentleman's ears are shut to our complaints.
When' he heard a gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
Nicholas) bring forwaid a resolution to fequeftratr,
or in milder words, withold the ttock which the
state of New-York has in the funds of the United
States : when he heard a gentleman from Georgia
(Mr. Ealdwin) who had been on the floor of
Congress almost from the beginning ; when he-had
heard that gentleman, with ail his experience in
the money concerns of the nation, declare, that the
United States was always conCidered indebted to
to the state of New York until the (ettlement was
made, and by this declaration bringing into view
high-toned evidence that errors, did fxilt against us,
in that fettlemt nt ; for 1 contend, said Mr. Coop
er, that men and governments always have a pretty
carreCt idea Â®f their general concerns. T<j hear
all this and he silent, said he, would be critr.inal :
yet to argue on the fubjeft, feenaed tÂ» be of little
use ; for, when we look the United States in the
face, and demand of them neither more nor less
than fnbftantial justice; when we complain that
egregious errors exist in the general settlement ;
when we state that many just charges of large a
mount were not brought forward ; when we state
that large quantities of wheat was delivered by our
state to the armies of the United States, at the
deprefTed price of one dollar per buftiel, according
/to a price-limi'ing ftatutc of onr state, exilting at
that time, and certificates ifiued by the officers for
this less than quarter price; when we state that
some other states received certificates at five dollars
per bushel for their quotas of wheat, and that thÂ»fÂ«
certificates counted on their face at the time of
liquidation and settlement with ours ; when we
state that powder-houses were eredted at the ex
pecee cf our state, and the proceeds turned!intd
the magazines of the United States, and the charges
never brought in at the general settlement : when
we complain of these hardships, what answer do we
receive ? Why, from Connecticut, the settlement
is had ; we do not understand you ; âfrom Massa
chusetts, a still more disagreeable tone, e*enaTort
p{ intimation that we are quibblers ; âfrom New
Jersey, a solid declaration that nÂ» consideration
ought to diminish or dismiss this demandâgiving
our complaints to the wind, without a hearing ; â
from Virginia, a Jlill mire tough fill, even an attempt
to fcquejlrate our Jlock. And why, or for what
cause, are we thus roughly bandied? Is it, said
he, because our government, in eider to keep up
the armies of the United States, gave a bounty of
fix hundred acres of land to fuel} as would serve
tlirte years ? Is it because our leaports were in the
hands of the enemy during the whole our
towns consumed with fire, and our merchants driven
to the mountains ? Is it because our frontiers were
over-run with white men from Canada, and lavages
from the wildernessâour floaiifliing villages laid
waste, and the inhabitants carried into savage cap
tivity ? Is it because our miodle counties bore the
burthen of being the feat of our own armies for
several years? Or is it be k -Â».ufe the revenue which
our state produces to the union, is not more than a
quarter of the whole revenue of the United States,
that feverah states, whose revenue to the union is
next to nothing, are so deaf to our complaints of
errors and hardlhips on our part in that settle
ment ?
What opinion, Jfaid Mr. C. should we have of a mer
chant, who (liould refufe to correct an error of great
amount in a fettlenftent made with his fellow merchant,
but should plead the settlement, and thus hold what he
j had got by raiftake or by a trick ? Why this would be
his true charadter, that the man who is only bound by
the law, would do any .unjust thing were it net for law ;
yea he would if yon please, pick pockets, were it not
for the penalty that follows.
An honest man is never afraid to have his charges
examined again and again ; knowing that the more
the truth is rutbed the brighter it (hinesj, If the charge
of the United States against our {lata is a jtift one, it
will no; be the less so for a new heat wg. I again re
peat it, said he, what individual would refufe a re-ex
amination of his accounts, if stared in the face by a
fellow trader, fiating :hit he had obtained great part
cf his wealth by an error in fettlesnent ? No man
would, no man dare. Ihe frowns of society would
prostrate hinvfor ever were he to attempt it, and more
especially if theperfonof whom he had taken this ad
vantage, vasa man of good fame and Â»f equal (land
ing with himfelf. And, in this point of view, 1 con
tend, said he, that the state of New-York is of fuffi
ciefit refpofibility in the unior.; and of such reputation
as to her accounts, as to have a fair claim on the Uni
ted States, that an order may be had for a nÂ«w hear
t
We further ccmplain bitterly of the rule under which
this settlement took place.
In (hort, said he, if it is honorable ; if it is dignified,
for the United Staies to refufe 11s a re-hearing, or at
tempt to sequestrate our stock, it is not less honorable,
it is not less dignified for our state to fell and transfer
their (lock in the public fund, Â»atid withold payment of
the fame until the errors which exist against us, can
' be cwrr<<3*'t. /,
I I (halt he aferd, said he, how this can be done ?On
! which lubjeiil I beg leave to advance one thought that
ha. struck my mind as * thing that would be fatisfa&c
ry to our Hate ; and no more than tubltantiaily hono
rable and just on the parte the United States, which
idea I (hajl oast before the committee, to the end that it
themeafure now before the committee Ikould prove in
efficient ; fomthiÃg on its basis may be adopted,âthat
is that three commifiioners be vetted with full power
from the United States, to join three commiflianers
from our state, with like power. Let them hear and
determine whether any, and if any how much we are
in debt to the union. I have no doubt, said he, such
a measure would be fatisfaftory to our legislature, and
I believe if found in debt, they would take order for
payment- Should Congress refufe a re-hearing of the
juil complaints of that settlement, as it relates to our
state, which is intitled to this fort of tender dealing ;
I (hall be for no provif.on being made to pay the de
mand. On the other hand, should Congress offer this
reasonable and fair thing of a re-hearing ; and our state
refnle or negleiS toacfl; I (hall be greatly disappointed
in their attachment to the general government which
I am sure i# firm and of a durable nature.
Mr. Havens said, when these refutations were
firft proposed, he did not think them very excep
tionable, being brought forward on the plausible
.ground of giving information to the different states
of (he Aims in which they flood indebted ; but, if
his infoimation was right, notification had already
been made to the different Hates, of the arjiount of
the balances found against them, and, therefore,
these resolutions could only be looked upon as lead
ing to something further, even to comuulfory
means being used to obtain a settlement. In this
point of view, though thtrefolutions contained no
thing dire<S!y objectionable, they became fa, and
it behoved the reprefentalives of New York to op
pose tUtm.
Though Mr. H. said he was not authorized to
fay what was the opinion of the legislature of New-
York of the settlement in question, amongst the
moll enlightened citizens of that state, he knew it
was conttdcred not only as unjitfl as to principle, but
verygieatly erroneous, ao.d highly injurious. tA that
state. He thought it probable that this was the
opinion sf tht legislature also ; afld fubftttitial jus
tice required that any error in any account should
be rectified at least, that the party who thought
there was an error should be fatisficd. If the state
of New York was fatisfied with i ef^eCt-to the debt
in question, he had no doubt, it would be paid.
With a view of putting the business intoalefs
objectionable form, he would propose an amend
ment, viz after " earnest reqneft," " that if they
(the said states) or any of them objeA to the prin
ciple upon which the balances have been made, they
will make known their objections to the govern
ment of the United States ; but if no objection,
that they will cause provision to be made, &c."
Mr. H. said he eould fee no objection which could
be reasonably made to this amendment.. If the
state of, New-York had any objections to the set
tlement, they would of course appoint an agent to
enquire into the mode in which the accounts had
been fettled ; this enquiry would produce fatisfaCti
on, and whatever was found to be the balance, it
would be chearfully paid ; but, if this amendment
were not agreed te, he said there might be embar
. ra(Tment3 thrown in the way ; embarraftmeÃts wliieh
mijrht prove insurmountable.
It had been remarked, Mr. H. said, that this
wbs a kind cf arbitration, and that the award was
final. He never understood it in that point of
light. If the bufmefs had afTumcd the face of an ar
bitiatinn, it would have been fettled in a public man
ner. An agent would not only have beea appoin
ted to bring in their own claims, but also te have
examined thsfe of others. But the bulinefs had
been fettled rather in a p:ivate manner than other
wise. The books had been kept from view. If
there had been no irregularity i n the" settlement, he
could fee no objection to its being laid before the
Ui.ited States at large. He had always understood
jhere was some reason for keeping the accounts
from public infpeflionj and it appeared fomcwhat
(trange. It looked as if there had been some er
rors committed which it were improper to (hew to
.the people of the United States. At any rate
such ideas had prevailed ; tl.oy had at least prevail
ed in the state ol New-Yoik. For these unfens,
he trusted, the amendment would not he oKjeCted
to.
Mr. HenderfoÃ hoped the amendment would not
prevail : it looked like inviting objections, at a
time when theie was no proof that any objections
exified to the payment of the balances in question.
It was allowed by the oppofers of the report be
fore them that at some period it would be proper to
enter into a nagociation kith the debtor dates ; he
thought there could be no better time than the pte
fent, nor any better mode than that prefciifced by
the resolution before them.
Mr. Kitchell faicl it appeared to him as if the
amendment was introduced for the ptirpofe of gi
ving the State of New-Yprfc an Opportunity to
make apologies for not doing what juflise and ho
nor lequired' of them. It was extraordinary he
said, that 'New-York had been notified two years
of this debt, and that they should now require
them to give some plea i:i j unification of their con
duCt. The gentleman from New-Yoik (Mr Coo
per) had printed the situation of that state during
the war in very strong colours. Other states Mi.
K. f id, fuft'ered equally with them. That gen
tleman had also dv*ek u-iuch upon what that state
had dons during the war j he would fay what the
state of New-Jersey had not done. Mr. K. then
went (too rapidly for us to follow him) over every
thing which he eonjeived the state of New-Yoik
had done to iis dil<-rn!it during the war, which be
fid Had not done. He said that state
was now only called upouto pay the debt (lie owed.
If they had objections to do this, they would make
them ; but rficy were not to cram them down tbrir
throats. Let them state their objections them
selves. He did not believe the state of New York
had empowered their delegates to objeCt to the pay
ment of this debt ; their business wai of a gene
ral legislative nature, and he thought it would have
been belter for them nat to have .interfered in the
business.
Mr. Havens said the gentleman from New-Jer
sey had dwelt much upon what that state had not
done ; he would just remind them of what it had
done'. Did it not lay a heavy tax on the light house
at Sandyhook ? For his own part, he despised any
thing like adverting to dale.merits. Rethought
such praflico '"ad ar. unfavorable afpefl tÂ« other
parts Â»f the Union, and therefore he would with
always to avoid refleÂ«io:B on any state. t
Mr. Kitchell said he did not mean to reflect OB
the state of New-York. He intended only to re,-
fer ta what Had been said about the indufiry s â(l
wealth of-that state at the expence of alltheother
dates. Wiih fefpcCt to the li\ laid upon the light
honfe, he would aflc whether the flats of' New.
York had not laid taxes upen every ftv.llop.and boat
whuh passed from New Jersey to that (late i
Mr. Swanwick fifa it was of little importance to
â¢he honfc what taxes had been laid by tlie state Â»f
New-York or New-Jrrfey. He hoped the amend
merit would not pals, becailfe it would fcern as if
they themfelvcs. doubted the jultice of the dehi.
If they had objefiions to the demand, they would
state them; without any piovilion fwr the purpose.
Mr. Livingfton said lie (hould. confine bis obfer.
vatiwns to the amendment, as that was under confi.
deration. When the general refutation was under
debate, it was objected by the icprefentatives from
tbe state or NÂ«w-Yoik, thnt she could uot be bouÃd
to pay the balance in quellion, tyecaufe {he had
not given her consent as a state ta the law for ap
piopriating the mode of settlement ; but now they
were told they njuft wait till that state make objec
tions ; that the dulegatesin that houfehad no right
to objedt to it, yet the state was to be bound by
'this fetilemen: which was made according to a law
palled by the delegates of that state ia-common
others. But it the delegates had not a right
(whic*. was his own opinion) to object to the jnft.
ness of the debt, they had certainly no right to
frame the law originally, and then the resolution
was wholly out of 'he question.
Mr. L. said he did not think the amendment of
liis colleague invited objedtion. The friends o! the
refolutihn told them that the. application was made
to know whether it was agreeable to the state to
pay the money or rot. Now the amendment made
the explanation what thry said it was, but what
ajipeared'to the delegates from New-Ywrk doubt
ful. He hoped therefore the amendment would
prevail. If it fliould not, it would cause what
gentlemen seemed to wish to avuid, delay ; be
cause, if it was negatived, he fhoult} think it his
duty, to call for forae delay, before the house a
greed to pass the refutation before them. He there,
fore hoped, if gentlemen wiftied for celerity, or
confiflency with their-own arguments, they would
not oppefe the amendment.
The motion was put and negatived, there being
only 2 1 members for it.
Mr. Livingfton then moved that the committee
rife for the purpose of a postponement. He tho't
they had a(right to ask this from the candor of the
house. It was a fwhjeCt, he said, which required
mature canfideration, and more time tha-i gentle
men had been yet able to give. He hoped there
fore this delay would be granted. He wilhed be
fore he decided on the bufintfs to obtain the sense
of his constituents on the fubjeft. For his own
part, he did not wish tne ciecifron to be put off al
together. He knew tho difsdvantages under which
the representatives of what were called the debtor
states labored, and he wilhed to have it determined
whether the-Hate of New, York was a debtor or a
creditor, whether the whole transaction was to be
binding, or whether the whole fttouhl be buried in
oyition.âThe result he said might be this ! The
delegates from the state of New-York do not re.'

whole. It waspoffiblc that that (lite might com;

Mtm.oirs of GENERAL WAYNE.
ANTHONY WAYNE, late Major general in the
army of thÂ« Ujiitcd States, was born in Chtfier coun
ty, Pennsylvania, in 1745 His grand father bor
a captain's conmiiflion at til* -battle c# Boyne, un
der King William, and was diftinguiftied for his at
tachment to the principles of liberty. The General's
father was a refpcclable farmer, and served for many
years as a representative for the eounty of Chester ia
the General Aflembly of Pennsylvania before the revo
lution. His son fuceeeded him as representative for the
County in 1773. In this eventful year, he began his
career as a patriot, and friend of the rights of man.
He took an active part in all the measures of the Assem
bly for that year which were opposed to the claims rf
Great Britain, and in connexion with John Dickin
lon, Thomas Mifflin, Edward Biddle, Charles Themp-
Ibn, and a few ether gentlemen, prepared the way for
the decided and ufiful part which Pennsylvania after
wards took in the American revolution.
In the year 1775 he quilted the councils of his coun
try, for the field. He tutercd the army of the.United
States asacoloncl. His name recruited a regirneiat in
a tew weeks in his nitive eounty. In the clofe'ofthis
year, he accompanied General Thompfen into Cana
da. Here he was fuon led into aClioti. In the defeat
of General l'hoipplori, he behaved with great bravery,
and was Angularly ufeful in saving a large tody of the
army,,by the judicious manner in which he coi,:duÂ£teil
their retreat atier th* General was made prifaner. In
this battle the General, then Col. Wayne, received a
Rcfh wound in his leg.âln the campaign sf '7761 he
served under General Gates at Ticondtrnga. Gen.
Gates esteemed him highly, not only for his courage,
and other military talents, but for his knowledge as
an engineer. It was said of him, that his eye wa-> near
ly equal to a meafnre, in judjring of heights and distan
ces, .a talent this of incalculable consequence in an offi
cer. At the cloie of this campaign he was ?i Â»-ated a
Brigadier General.
He bore an afiive part in the campaign of 1777.
He fought at Bran.lywine, and for .1 long time retard
ed the progre'fi ..f tile Britilh arm; in trVrffiivg C had's*
ford. Germantown, and at the I'aoli,
on the Lancaster road. In the la/t of these battles
(wheithehad a leparate command) and in whit!.was defeated ; âTils coolness and intrepidity in the j
mi.lft of a rpoft bloody scene, finally sustained his char.
a<Jter *bove censure, and added credit to the American
arras.
In 17 78 he shared in the hanor of the viilory over
the British army at Monmouth. In the fanjie year he
dittinguifhed himfelf by a bold attack upon a block
house on the North River. It was rendered unfuccfi"-
ful according Â»o the account given of it by General J
Waihwgton in his letter to Congress, only by the in
temperate valor of his troops. v
In 1779. he diftingurfhed himfelf by fu'rprifing and
Jtorming Stony Point âIn effe&ing this business, he 1
marched several miles through a deep roorafs in the '
middle of the night. In the attack upon the fort, he
wasftruckdown.by a ball which grarifed hisheai. It
was expe<!\ed that he was ; but he foen rose so as
to reft on one knee. Feeling hiÂ« situation, and be'iev- *â¢
jng his wound to be mortal, he cried out to one of his 0
Aids, Carry me forward, and let ras die in the fort." '
When he entered it, he jjave orders to flop the effu
fion of bleotl by th' sword, and to make the garrison
prilbners of war.âThis humane/ command was the t
more generous as the garrison eonfifted of fjme of the t
troops who had ufetl the bayonet without mercy, at s
the faoli. F
In the year 17*1, he bore an a&ivepart in the cam- e
paign which reduced the army of Lord Cornwallis to <j
the necessity of surrendering prisoners of war. After f
this event, he was sent by General Washington, to con- h
dudl the war iÂ« the State of Genrgia. Here his pru- S
dcnce, courage, and military Ikill were amply tried.
He contended wi'h equal fueceii with British soldiers,
Indian savages, and American traitors. In a short tl
time, he established peace and liberty in that once dif- f
trailed state. As a reward for his eminent frrvires, S
the lfgiflature <Jf Georgia presented him with a valua- f
ble farm.
Upon the return of peace he retired to private pur
suits. In 1787 he fubferibed as a member ofthe PeÂ»n
fylvania conventionale inftrumtnt which declared the
prcftnt Federal Coti'lVitution of the United States to be
part of ths supreme law of the land.
In the ye?r 1791, he accepted ofthe command of
the Amarlcan army, to be employed agjynft the Indi
ans, who fqr several years had carried on a fuceefsful
and desolating war, upon the frontiers of the United
StateÂ». In this Situation his military genius broke forth
with accumulated luflre. He disciplined and created
an army, and by uniting in his fyttem of ta&ics In
dian llratageir.s with civilized bravery, he led on his
troops to /lAnry over numerous and conledtrated
tribes, and thereby gave peace in a single day to the
United States.

several defeats, Moreau was obliged to recrofs the
Rhine on the night of the 26th of OS. to Hun

Morcau had conSrufled a large and solid work ;
but after a little skirmishing wuhthe Hnlfars, they
evacuated the heights and redoubt, before any in*
fantry could come up, and nothing now remains on
this fide of the Rhine, but a few troops in a fma.l
Tete de Pont, behind which is a kind of horn
work, lately conftrufted on the island, called Shu

great leffes in cannon, prisoners, &c. bolh by Mr.

Gentlemen,
I am informed that " Winterhotham's Hillnrical, '
Geographical, and Philosophical View of the United
States of America," firft pubiilhed in England, has
been rep, inted in this country
It is apparent to every intelligent reider, an I in
tne Englifli edition it is acknowledged, that the author
I " his availed himfelf of the I "hours and abilities" of
others s and that "he has often no other merit than
what arises from feleftion and a few connecting fen-
If '
tences.
Part of my literary property has-been in this manner
invaded ; and I am advise t 'hat flie KVt'S ofttl'e tJHit
ed States will give me a fufSci.-at remedy against any
person who (hall .reprint, import, publith, fall, or
expose to sale, any part of the shove work, which
may comp ehend any confiderahle portion of my pub
lications.
As it is probable that some sopies of the above
work mav be trsufmitted to you for sale, T have
thought it friendly and proper to apprize you of my
intention to apply Ui# prSvifiÂ»ns of the law upon this

Yeflerday the Senate of this Commonwealth waited
on the Prrfident of the United States and
presented to him the following address :
To GEORGE WASHINGTON,
Pxbsidiht of the United Status.
SIR,
YOU R late address to the pesple of the United
States, whillt it awakens every sentiment of grati
tude, deeply affects our feelings with regret.
The friendly cÂ«unfel you have offered, to your
fellow citizens, to induce them to adhere ftedfaltly
to their present union repress the spirit of par
ty : to cherilh religion, knowledge, and public
credit ; and to maintain a dispassionate and impar
tial, though amicable disposition tawards foreign .
nations, meets with our warmed approbation. In
your forcible expolition -ef the dangers which will |
result to their freedom, fafety and prosperity, from '
3 dereliaion of those falutsiy maxims, we recog
nize thatjuft discernment of the real interest as our |
countty, and that firm adhetence to the principles
of true patriotilm, which have always diftinguilhed
your public conduct. Your fellow-citizens, fe*
i lible that with your measures their dearelt interefU
were intimately conneaed, have regarded them with
anxious attention ; t.hÂ«y have beheld you, under
the aufpioes Â»f divine providencc, leading their ar
mies to viaory, and guiding their councils to prof
-1 peritv and peace ; nor has the closest examination
of yourcondua produced any other effea, than to
flrengthen their reliance on your wisdom and
1 virtue.
The various testimonials of attachment, whicis
â  you have received from the people of the United
States, mult have fully convinced you, that those
affeaionate fenfation6 towards them, whifch are so
feelingly exprefled in your address, are reciprocated
by correspondent femimems on their part. The
, figna! inflance of steady approbation, with which
they have supported your administration, and the
- ftiirCefs which lias attended it, have exhibited to the
- ivortd a (Inking proof, that the mod effeaual me
tliod of securing the confidence, and accompli(hing
f the welfare of an enlightened nation, is,- to pur
â¢ iue, with undeviating frrmnefs,a policy founded on
r the purest integrity.
The fatisf#aien ve have derived from your fa
il lutary communications, is greatly allove Iby the
Intorrhation which has accompanied them, that we
ire (*o soon to lie deprived of those faithful fervi.-es
fjom which such important benefits have resulted to
this in cemmoa with the othef flutes. We are, at
the fame time, compe'".*d to a {Tent to the ju ll ice of
your claim :o that repose in the evening of your
days, which nas been so long facrificed to the voice
and intereflj of your country.
You will carry with you into retirement, the so
lid enjeiymfnt ariGng from the applause of your
grateful country, and the canfciouf.iefs of a life da
voted to virtue and public utility. In addition to
these faurces of happiness, may you long enjoy the
bielflnga of health 5 mav you largely partake of
that national felitfity,.to the establishment of which
you have so eminently contributed ; and may your
successors in office, be influenced by yoar example,
in their efforts to promste the peace, fafety, and
dignity of the United States. *

To the Senate of Peunstlfahu.
Gentlemen,
I RECEIVE with great pleasure the expressi
onÂ» of your approbation of ray public ferrices. The
general mirks of fatisfa&ion, and the various tefli
monies of feleft and difceraing bodies of men a
mong my fellow citizens, refpe&ing my public
coftduft, while they have ftimslatsd my exertions to
bÂ« ufeful to my country, the sole object Â«f all my
aiMs and withes, have also enforced the juftncls of
your remark, " that the nvift effectual method of
fecuringtha confidence, an 4 accomplilhing the wel
fare of an enlightened nation, is ta pursue with Â»n
---deviating firmneft, a policy founded in pure inte
grity.'' And I (hall be patdoned when 1 add, that
conscious integrity has been my unhealing support,
and while it gave me confidence in the m?afures I
purfaed, the belief of it, by acquiring to me the
confidenae of my fellow citizens, ensured thefu:-
cess Which they have had. This consciousness will
accompany me in my retirement : Without it,
public applauses could be viewed only as proofs of
public error, and felt as the upbraiding of petfonal
(dement. In this retirement, to behold the nation
al felicity will be largely to partake in it; and if
with this felicity I enjay health, which you kindly
wish me, my hopes in this world will be oonfum
mated.
(Signed) Go. WASHINGTON.
For the Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Ffnno,
It is proposed to fubrait a fe.v observations on
thequeltioii " WheAer a citizen has a right to
dived himfelfof his allegiance, without thecosfent
of the society of which he is a member," âas ap
plicable to the cafe of captain Barney, who is fai l
to be a&ing under a commiflioH to capture tne
property of citizens of the United States.
To acquit captain Bumy, or a.ny nther Ameri
can citizen, in his it will be tiectffary to
proyc, either that the tight to expatriate, is a
natural right, which man cannot be deprived of, on
entering into fo;icty ; or if nut a natural right,
one ftipuhted for in the facial cÂ«mpa<Â£\, into which
' he entered, or permitted by fume Â«& of his affoci
atis.
Is it a na'tiral ? We shall not apply to
books for a solution of this problem. There is
hitjher authority nearer at hand. We conceive that
Americans, who havu had a frae intercourse with
thj savage tribes, and a pretty correct knowledge i
<*f ihe principles which govern them, are better able
to determine, what are maa's right* in a Jiate of
nature, than either H tSbes or PufFendorf. What
do wu learn.from their experience ? That the mem
bers of tribes are attached each to his par
ticular tribeâknd that no inflanees are known of
a savage leaving his afTociates, and connefUng him
felf voluntarily With a different tribe to fight against
his original tribe or nation This fact, therefore,
may be conftdered r.s a eonclufive, though negative
proof ; that it does not belong to man, as an in
herent right, to divert himfelfof his allegiance, or
desert his tribe and turn his arms againll thofs with
whom he was an original afTociate.
Is it then under the conflitution ot laws of the
United States* that her citizens acquire the right
to abandon and plunder theii afTociates ? No
Neither the conflitution nor laws favor or fofler any
such principle. On the contrary, the afTociates to
the constitution, bind themselves " to a mart perfect
union," which cannot mean a right to desert each
other, and thus diflblve tha unionâ" to ejlablifk
juflice," which cannot meas a right to turn pirates
'â" to insure domejlic tranquility," which cannot
j mean a right to diflurb itâ" to provide for the
I common defence," which cannot mean a right te
weaken itâ 44 to promote the general welfare," which
I cannot mean a right to deltroy itâapd " tofecure
I the klejftngs of liberty to themfehetand their fioflerity,"
, which cannot mean, to secure them to the people
of France and their pufterity.
Such are the objedts and purposes, as exprefTed
in cheir conflitution, for which the citizens of the
United States have afTociated. They havefolemnly
bound themselves to abide by this expression of
their will, and they have not yet altered these par
ticulars by any fubfequei.t inflrument. As to the
laws, these emanate from the coitllitution, and mult
be subservient to itâthey cannot contravene its
objeÂ£ts, or authorise what is to destroy
the compact itfelf. For, if captain Barney miy
lawfully make a piize ot the property of 'he citi
zens of the United States, under colour of a
French commiffioi), and an oath of allegiance to the
republic of France, every other American citizen
may a A in the fame manner towards their afTociates,
which amounts to a breaking up of the society.
1 But does not this interpretation of the compad
" trench upon man's natural liberty and independ
; ence ? Mait does not derive from nature a right to
violate engagements, into which he has freely en-
I tered ; nor a right to prey tipon his affociatas,
- whose welfare he it pledged to promote ; nor has
i nature given to man faculties and powers, that car
render him independent of others, er enable hiir
- to live without society.
t If man may at all fever himfelf t-emthafe with
c whom he is ail original affoctf tes,afid ci.terinto ob
&
II orations with a fereign nation; the new obliga
tions can be no farther binding on him, thim as
permitted by his ass.i iates, or as they do not clalh
with anterior and primary obligations.
On this ground a, government may naturalize
the fubje&s or citieens of other governmentsâbut
.cannot exa& from them ftrviees, repugnant to their
original obligations, unless they have been released
from these, by some adl of their aflociates.
These opinions are net newâhey are but a tran
fciipt of the general sense of mankind touching
this queflion, in all ages of the world.
I shall only add ta these (hart remarks, an exÂ»
tract of an ordinance of France on the fame fnbjeil
âwith a commentary thereon by Valin.
ORDINANCE.
Article 111. " We prohibit all our fuhje&s,
from taking commijjiens, from any foreign king,
prince or state, ta equip vefTels of war and cruiae
under their flag, unless by our pcrm'ijion, under pain
of being treated as pirates."
COMMENTARY.
"To these general and indefinite propoGtions,
there is no exception. They extend to commiflions
taken from powers friendly or allied, neutral or fuf
pefted. They relate also at well to a time of peace
as war.
" The reason for so general a prohibition is, be
eaufe it amounts to a fpeciesof deftrtion, combined
with on engagement to serve a foreign sovereign.
That of imploring his protection to cruize under
his flag, in preference to the prote&ion and flag
of their own favereign.
" The alliance of the sovereign with the prince
from whom the commission may be taken, cannot
ferre as an excuse, because though "an ally, he i*
not less a foreign power. Besides, if tl\ecomniif
fion of the foreign prince, is to a& again# the paw
er with whom he intends to remain neutral, it would
be giving him just grounds of complaintâwhich
might finally be the cause of a rupture.
" It is therefore evident, that fsch' commiflisnt
cannot be taken nvithiut the permtjjton of the fove
*eign : and that a contravention meiits the puuilh
ment due to piratesâas decided the,4th article of
the declaration of the Ift February 1650 âthe ar
ret of'con ncil of the 26th Augull of the fame
yearâand that of the 31(1 O&ober 1662.
" This fame declaration, besides the words all our
fuljeSs, adds domiciliated or not domiciliated in our
kingdom, or the countries under our dominion,
which addition is to be underftjod of the above ar
ticleâbccaufe Frenchmen having fettled in a fo
reign country, are not less Frenchmen and fnhject*
âat least they remain to far fubjcQi that if they
take up aims againll, the king or a3 againfl the
French vtffelsâ-they deserve death as rebels to their
king and traitors to their country."

it is clearly and fcuisfa&orilv afeertained, that mr.

c- away to mr. John H. linjlon, his foti-in-law, to his
daughter, miss M'Clenacban, and to his son, George

(" as well as ooufiderable personal property, in the city
' s and county of Philadelphia, in the oounty of Lancaf
* ter, in the county of New-Caftie on Delaware, and
, e elsewhere, with a view, as it is apprehended, to de
,d feat the Creditors in the recovery of their just debts.â
rs This is, therefore, to forewarn all persons whomlli
ig ever, against the purchase from the fiid grantees, or
a! either Â©f them, of any portion of the said veal orper

without delay be taken Fo render the fame liable to

I- TJ3E caution introduced into the public prints,
18 warning all perfonr. against purclialing from the
;c grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
rt large, resl and petfonal estates he conveyed away to
his fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upeti the fubjeft by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
_ M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clenn
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confidnd in the fubferibers by
, those creditors: a step which it would hava besn a
ta breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
k- The very statement of the fait therefore must dif
ie pel the imputation that it was either " precipitaw
Lo or vindiAivc." It originated in a desire to feoure
r, the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
e- ment of his just debts. It was fan&foned by the
in ndviae of council as a measure necejfary to the fafety
in of the creditors. If the advertisement has been
al injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own (injuflihable conduit, not to the fub
feribers who have merely publifhsd the truth in
j terras as mild as the faÂ£t would admit, and who
1. mean to investigate in a high court of justice the
?- validity of those purchases of which Mr. M'Cle
naehan so confidently speaks.
The fubferibers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
caution against purchasing of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
purchase from atjy other persons (if such there be)
cr to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made firailar
â¢ conveyances.
