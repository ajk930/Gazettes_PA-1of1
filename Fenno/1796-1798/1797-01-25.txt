AN ENQUIRY
Concerning Political Justice,
And its Influence on viorals and Happiness,
By William Godwin.
THE reputation of this work is already well efta
blMied ifi Europeâlt is hardly neceflary for an AmÂ»-
rican editor to fay mure than barely to mention, that
the Enquiry concerning Political Juftiee has ever
iiuoe its publ cation been a favorite performance with
ti c fr/iv,us or republican government. The stile is
pure, nervous, and classical; the ideas are strongly
marked by an original vein of thinking ; and, amongst
a multitude of other just and linking paflagei, the
author's delineation of the peculiar infelicities insepa
rable from the condition of a King, may be pointed
out as a most masterly specimen of philosophical dtf"
tjuifition. The latest London edition of this work
fells in this city at four dullars and an half.

Which accompanied the niefifoge of the President of
the United States to bojh Houses of Congress,
January 19, 1797.
l.etter to Mr. Piucknry, Mittifter Plenipotentiary as
the United States to the French Republic.
Continued.
In his letter of the 3d of June 1796. which yau
will find among the papers refpefHng the Caffius,
Mr. Adet mentioned the affair of the Favorite at
New-York j and intimated an idea that the Execu
tive might, in lijte manner, cause the prosecution
againfl le Caffius to ceale. But the proceedings
in the cafe of the Favorite were wholly ; n the haods
â of the executive officers, who were under the Pre
fulent's immediate controul, and to whbra, on evi
dence fatisfadory to the Executive, orders were
given todifcontinue the process. In this affair of
the Favorite, we are fortunate in finding one ease
ill which Mr. Adet (contrary to his affertian in
his note of November 15th) acknowledges that
justice was done by our government. You will
obterre in Mr. Faachet's letter of the 23d of Sep
tember 179,4., a very formidable complaint in this
affair of th* Favorite ; That it was pretended that
a privateer, fitted for a cruise, had deposited aims
on board her, and that this pretext was used for
vifitinjj and pillaging her: Tha* (he was a ship t>f
war of the Republic, then serving as a (lorÂ« ship
until flic could b~ repaired : 1 hat the sovereignty
of France was violated, and her flag insulted. Yet
by the letter ot John Eamb, efquiie, collcrsor ef
the port of New-York, of the 22 d of November
*794, you will fee that at the time the /"eizure was
made of the fufpefte'd articles on board the Favor
ite, " flie h ivir.g been totally dismantled, her crew
Â«â¢ sent on other (hips of war, and her fails,
" and other materials, fold Â»t public auc
tion, fi>e Wris coi liciered as a hulk\ otherwise the
" event would not have taken place." The col
lator further declares that the charge of pulling
down the national flag and hoitling mother in its
place, wa-s groundless.
â¢ Thcfe are all the cases expressly mentioned by
Mr. Adet, in which French privateers and their
prizes have been brought under the coghizanre of
our courts of just ice ; and all, therefore, to win h
an aufwer can be ditefted: Had he qited the other
cases, which he fays would fill a volume, we have
no doubt that there would be found in thtm, as in
those which have been mentioned, abundant reason
to juftify the government and the tribunals.
Mr. Adet s complaints are not confined to im
putations of iujuitice experienced, by French pri.
vateers and their prizes, from our courts ; ,
Ift ' He protests again ft the violation of the
171b article ofthetteaty, in contempt of which
" the America,, tribunals have taken cognizance
Â« of the validity of prize, made by French ships
" of war or privateers, under pretext of original
" * t r mament or augmentation of armament in the
" United States; or of capture within their line
" Â° f i"rifdiÂ£Ho n .*>- But his predeceflor, Mr.
Fauchet, after faying tf,at oar admiralty courts
interfered :Â« prize causes on the ground of Â« seizure
|| tvifhm thejurifdifiional line ofthe United States,
or of armament or augroentdtirn of armament as
" thecapturing veffdsi" their pert,.," immediately
adds Â«â  On this fubjeft, fir, yon request me to fpe
" Clf y t0 yÂ» u Â» c ice ii mft an e, in which a prize was
" arretted, which did not come under that denomi
" "Â«*Â»<". an d yhti take the tiouble toeftablifh that
" they have a right to interfere in every cafe that
|| can be brought under thcfe heads. In the firft
|| place fir, I never have, atleaft to m J recoil,Sion,
tontejlea the nght ofy:, U r courts, or ofthe govern
' went, to interfere in matters of the nature of those
y<"> mention but 1 complain of the facility with
" which prizes have been thrown into those two
" clafles, which do not belong to them." He
then fays that he cauld cite a great numbar
of anjÂ»rs te which he alludes-: but contents
himielt with mentioning only two. The firft
is the cafe of lalbot, of which I have already
given some details, and which, with the docu.
ffieHts referred to, will (hew this to have' been
an unfortunate instance to Support his com
ynint. The other is that of the prizes of the Citi- |
*eÂ» of Marseilles, alio already mentioned, and
which will not juftify a comprint ; for although the
final dectfien was in favor of the privateer, yet the
sentence of the diftrift court was not reversed in the
â¢ireuit court but upon the introduction of new tef
imeny : and thefupreme court allowed nj damages,
because the teftiiaony was so ambiguous as to juftify
the appeal.
But quitting tie contradiflory declarations of
the Frcocli mimfters Â£ and referring you tc tlip let
ter dated Augufl fl6, J793, from the Secretary
of State to oui Minister at Paris (which hat been
pufclifhed) for the reafoaing of our government, on
"this fubjeift, and the demonftrati'on of their right
and duty as a neutral power, to prohibit any ef the
belligerent powers arming their vefiejs in our ports,
eorfequeutly to re ft ore to their proper owners pri
w taken and brought in by ' veffils so unlawfully
Â»rmed,~ or when taken within our line of jurifdicti
cÂ», I will only add hereâThat the principles of
the rolrs on this fubjeft firft adopted by the Presi
dent on the most mature deliberation received after
â¢ward* the fanÂ£ti6n of Congress, by their aft of the
sth of June 1794, and of the Judges in all their'

-1. Mr. Adet "protests agatnd the riolatioÃ of
" the 17th article of the treaty, i;' contempt of
" which English vessels, -which had made prize or>
4 Â« Frenchmen, have been admitted into the ports o!
" the United States." The conftrnÂ£lion >.f this
part of the 17th article for which Mr. Adet, after
'his predecessor Mr. Fauchct, contends, it thisâ
That if a national (hip of war of the enemies of
France has at any lime, and in any part of the globe,
made prize of a French veflel, such (hip of war is
to be allowed no (belter or refuse in our ports, utt
lefs file is driven in through Hrefs of weather ; and
then (he is to be made to depart as foen at polfi
ble. On the contrary, the conllrudtion adopted by
the F-xecutive of the United States, and exprefled
in the rules before mentioned, which had been trans
mitted to the colle&ors in August 1793, was thi â  â
That privateers only of the enemies of France were
absolutely excluded from our ports, except as be
fore, when compcljcd to enter through llrsrfs of
weather; putfuant to the 22d article of the trca
ty ; while the national (hips of war of any other
nation were entitled to an asylum in our potts, ex
ceptirig those which (hould have made prize of the
people or property of France, coming in with their
prizes.
On the 9th of September 1793, the Secretary
of State thus expressed to the Bririlh miwifter the
determination of the Executive.* u The public [kips
" of -war of both nations [French and Enijlilh]
" enjoys perfect equality iÂ«, our portsâill, inca
" fesof urgent nescfikvâ2d, in cases of cotnfort
" Â»nd convenienceâ<3c 3d, in the time theychoofe
'â¢ to continue, and though the admission of prizes
" and privateers of Frauce 11 exclafive, yet it is the
" efttift of treaty/' Jcc.
In fuppojt of onr conftruftion of the treaty, it
has been oUferved, that " fthe firft part of the
" 17th article relates to French ships of war and
" privateers entering our ports with their prir.es :
" the 3d, coniralls the situation ot the enemies of
" France by forbidding such as (hall have made
prize of the French ; intimating from this con
" neÂ£lioÂ« o* the two elaufes, that those forbidden,
" are <hÂ»fe which bring their prizes with them."
To thcfe obfervatians I- will addâThat if the lite
ral ivnftru&ian contended for by the French mi
r.iflers were admitted, then although the public ships
of war which had made prize of French people or
would be excludeo from oar ports, yet
the prizes of such public (hips might be received,
and they might be fold too ; far the prohibition in
the 22d aiticle of the treaty applies only ta priva
teers and their prizes ; while the government of the
United States judged that the 17th article was in
tended to exclude the prizes made en the French
by public (hips as war as well at those made bypri
vateers ; and gave directions accordingly to have
thera excluded. Further, if it had been intended
to exclude from our ports th * public /hips of war of
the enemies of France, coming "without any prize,
then they would doubtless have been comprehended
in one provision with the privateers in the 22i ar
ticle : for privateers are thereby excluded, whether
they came with 01 without prizes. But public (hips
of war are not comprehended, or at all referred to
in the 2id article ; whence the conclusion is fair,
that it was no! intended to forbid them coming
alone { and consequently that the exclusion provi
ded in the 17th article applies ta them only when
they would come into our pons -with their prizes ;
this last claufc of the fame article being in its form
opposed to the firft clause which admits the entrance
of French (hips <with their prizes. Betides, if a
public ship of war of the enemies of France comes
into our ports without any prize, how is it to be
known whether (he has or has not made prize of
the people or properly of the French ? Who is to
create a tribunal to inweftigate and pronounce on
the fa& ? Bui if (he comes with a prize the cafe
presents no difficulty ; (he brings with her the Evi
dence which goes to the exclusion of her and hÂ»r
prize.
I mud now advert to some others of Mr. Adet's
charges against the government of the United
Slates.
I ift. "It [the government of the Ulfited State*]
j " put in question whether it Ihould execute the
j " treaties, or receive the agents of the rebel and
" proscribed princes." And is there any thing in
this uujuftifiable or extraordinary ? Was it easy for
a nation distant as ours, to obtain promptly such
accurate informal ion as would enable it duly to e
ft i mate the varying condition of Fiance? In 1791
the eonflitution formed by the conllituent afltmbly
was accepted by Louis the 16th ; it was notified
to the United States in March 1792. Congress
tltfirod the Prcfident to communicate to the king
of the French their congratulation on theOccafioq.
In 1792 the kinjf was suspended. In Sep
temhr'r royalty was aboliih-'d; and in January '93,
Loais the 16th tried and condemned by the con
vention, fuffererf death. Was it easy to keep paca
with the rapid futvtiiion of such revolutionary e
veats ? And waÂ« it unlawful for our government
ur.drr such cirrumftances even to deliberate ? I do
â  ret that information of the death of the king
: was received from oar miVifter at Paiis until May
ift, 1793. The news howevet had previously ar
rived in such manner as to attrad the attention of
government; for in April the President had deter
mined to receive a minister from the F+encti repab.
lie. And it is remarkable that this was before he
knew that a minister had arrived in tbe United
States. This promptitude in deciding a leading
question dees not,bear any strong marks of hesita
tion. And was there 110 merit in this Tcady de
termination to acknowledge the French republic ?''
! Had it been before acknowledged by any power
/Ten the glnbe ? How long did France Fxfttate to
the republic of the United States?
j A year and a half. And under what circuradances
j was the acknowledgment finally made ? Aftfr the:
capture of a whole British army appeared to have
. eftablilhed our independence. But of this more
j hereafter.âln matters of importance (and what
i could de more important than the decifiun ofa neu.
| tral and allied nation on queliions perhaps involving
j war or peace ?) is it the part of wisdom to rqe#
jail deliberation even on paints whisk do net #bvi-

2,1. " It made ail inÂ£dious proclamation of neu-
.tiality."
I have already remaiked that this proclamation
received the pointed approbation of Corigrefs; and
I might truly add of thegre.it body of the citi
zens of the United Slates. And what was the
general objedt of this proclamation? To picferve
us in a (late of peace. And have not the miniftcrs
of France declared that goveinment did not
desire us to enter into the war ? And how was
peace to be prVferved ? By an impartial Neutrality.
And was it not then the duty of the chief magi
strate to proclaim this to -our civzerss, and to in
form them what a&9 would be deemed departures
from their neutral duties ? This was done by the
prochtraation. It declared it to be the du'y, inter
est an 1 disposition of the United States to adopt
and ptirfue a co; du<st friendly and impartial to
ward the belligerent powers: It warned the citi
zens to avoid all acts yvhich might contravene that
disposition : it declared that whafoever of the ci
tizens (hould render himfelf liable to or
forfeiture under the law of nations, by comnfftisg
or abetting hostilities igainft any of those powers,
or by carrying to any of them Articles deemed con
traband of war, would not receive the protection
of the United States against such punifcment and
forfeiture: and that the Pivfident had given,in
ftrnftiotn to the proper officers to prosecute all per
sons who Ihould violate the'aw of nations wttb re
fpecVto the powers at war or any of them. To
what in all thiÂ« can the epithet inftdious be applied ?
On the contrary, is not the whole tranfadion
Damped with candor and good faith ?
3d. " By its chicaneries, it abandoned French
" privateers to its couris of jtiftice." Abandoned
them to its courts of jujlice ! Sir, yon know many

whole adminifttation of juftiee our citizens are fa
tisfied i and we believe they may challenge the
world to furnilh a proof that they have nÂ«t admi

correspondences with the French remitters formerly
published joined to those now furmfbed you with
the other documents accompanying them, will (how
how htudly they can complain of the proceedings
in our courts, and at the fame time with how lit
tle juftiee.
4th- " It eluded the amicable mediation of the
" republic, for breaking the chains of its citizens
" at Algiers." We did not entertain any doubt
of the friendly disposition Â»f the French republic to
aid us in tfail bufinefj. Bui what was teally dune
we have never known. You will find herewith Mr.
Fnuchet's letter of June 4th, 1794, aad the answer
of the fecretiiy of lUte, on tbe6ih, to which Mr.
Adct refers. The infoi mation en the fubjefi, which
Mr. Fauchet expe&cd " in a little time from En
rope," probably never arrived : at least it was never
communicated to our government. There is surely
in the secretary's answer, no evidence that our go
vernment were unwilling to .accept the mediation ef
the republic. On the contrary, we have relied upon
it to aid our tiegoiiaiiuns with the Barbary powers.
Accordingly, when colonel Humphreys went from
hence in 1795, clothed with powers for negotiaring
peace with those dates, he was particularly in
iiru&ed to solicit the mediation of the French
republic ; and for that purpose only, he went from
Lifban to Paris, where, through our minider, the
committee of Public Safery mniiifcftcd their dif
position to contribute to the success of his miffiou.
But colonel Humphreys was at the fame time au
thorised to depute Jofcpfe Dor.aldfon, cfquite, (who
had been appointed confiif of the United States
for Tunis and Tripoli, and who went wi;h colonel
Humphreys from America) to negotiate iramedi
atcly a Ueaty with Algiers : for in a country where
a negotiation depended on so many contingencies,
it was of the laH imparlance to be ready to feii;
the favorable moment to e(Fc4\ a peace whenever it
(heuld offer* Such a moment prefeutcd on Mr.
Dosaldfon's arrival at Algiers. He had not been
there forty-eight hours before the treaty, was con
cluded. It is also a fa& that it was effected with
out the aid of the French consul at that place.
However, with respect to Mr. Donaldfon's nego
tiation, we are well infortned that Â«â  His net eon
" ferring with the consul of France was not his
" fault; and if he had done it, that it would have
" injured his cause. Neither the republic nor her
" consul enjoying any credit with the dey." But
we are at the fame time informed that the caule of
this was transitory, and ought not to hinder us from
endeavoring to engage hei* interest sos other places
and in t%at place for future occasions. Agreeably
ta this idea, the agent ps the United States ap
plied to the French consul, Herculais, at Algiers,
the last Spring, to recommend a fuitablc person to
negotiate a treaty with Tunis. The person recom
mended was employed, and we have been informed,
had in part succeeded, and was expected to com
plete a treaty ofpeace. This information was com.
municated to our minider at Paris, in a letter dated
30th of August last, from the French miniftet for
toreign affairs, accompanied by an excradt cf a let
ter from the consul Herculais.
In all these Hanfaftions, far from difcovertng a
trace of evidence ts support Mr. Adet's charge,
the revcrfe is manifefily proved.

The fame reasoning will apply to captures made
by illegal privatceis; that is, by fiieh as wereann

in our jmifdi&mn. it is very puffible, iuiieed,
that in feme cales the initaced subjects or public
agents of n.-.:ions whose jSrcperty was taken bv
French p ivateeis might commence vexatious pru

quently our own citizens, and in every na
tion in the w^rld; and the only rcftraints on the
vindictive of men, in fu h cases, which
the policy of free governments has, imposed, are
the damages which the courts compel the mtlieiou*
prosecutor to pay to the injured par.y. If, as Mr.
Adet affeits, damages have in UvÂ® cases only been
granted by the cjurts to French privatierS, even
when the deciiions have been in their favor, it has
arisen from their own c#nduft ; or the om'ffion of
their counsel; or from accidental circumllances,'
which, ir. the opinian of the courts, furnifhed rea.
fonable preemptions agnintt them of having vio
lated, the laws, either by illegally arming in our
ports or making the captures within our juiifdic
tien. If, on the other hand, tfa. y have, in tha
event of con rary decisions, been always condemn,

because they were always in the wrsng. For no

That our commerce has been interrupted by the

to deny: the universal rsfentracHt and indignation
excited by those injuries, were admiffians of the
{*& : but that the government has coinived at the

commerce. She knew the conduit of maritimd
powers in all their wars : particularly she was ac*

all her wars with France. And if knowing ilitfe
things, France then expefled that in all subsequent

Francuij, December 11
On Saturday la It arrived in town via New-Yetk,
from C. Francois, Capt. Atwood, late of thefchr.
Jane, of this place. He went to the Cape, an a
common trading voyage, on hi* arrival there, a
guard of soldiers was immediately placed on beard
his vefl'el, and soon after lighters sent along lide,
and the whole of his cargo forcibly taken out, not
even excepting hi# own and the poor feamen'a ad
venturesâthe moll ruffian fury marking the plun
dirers during the whole operation. On crquiiinn
the reasons fur such condud of the officers of the
government, he was told that they were au-horifed
by (He French Dircftory } that they were diftrefled,
larving, and .would help tfiemlfelves as they could 5
that orders were iffurd for the capture of all Ame
r> in vefT.ls, bnuiH to Bri'ifh ports ; afid, that they
(h'juld soon be at open war with America. Pet it i -
ons to the admmift ration were treated with the
m II illiberal contimp' and indifference. Twelve
wther American veflels were there which had been
treated in the fame way.
Among the veflels that had fuffered under these
unexampled atrocities, was a brig â, Hilman,
of Purtland ; brig Abigail, S. ot, of New-York ;
and brig , Reynolds, of Savannah.
"1 he people of colour, were averse to those mea
sures, and appeared much attached to the Ameri
cans; the persecution originated in the eommilfioa
ers, among whom is uumbered the notorious Sow-
THON AX.
The A meri'.an Consul had written to the Secre
tary of State an thr fubjeft, enclosing the order*
which had beta pablilht-d, and placarded.
An embargo had continued there during; the
whole of capt.'Atwoed'a stayâa temporary fsfpen
fian alone enabled him to leave the Cape, io a vef

Capt. Atweod has entered his protest against the
treatment he receivad.

es, plumbs, ne&arinos, apricots, grapes, figs, rafberries, i
gooseberries, strawberries, and currants; the whole admi- i
rably varied by turfed slopes which have been formed by ]
great labour and expence. Bordering upÂ»n these im- I
provements, are feverid lots, in a high date of cultivation,
and well set with red clover and orchard grass, from 1
â which three heavy crops <Jf h.iy are taken every year. Ad

The arable lands are fÂ® advantageously divided as to as- I
ford an opportunity of making a large quantity of Indian
corn annually, without bringing the field into similar cul- â¢
ture oitner than once in four consequently the <
lauds may be improved by keeping up the inclofures during
the intermediate years, or may be bensficially fallowed for

of free ftane near to the river, is plentifully supplied with
remarkable fin.: water and poffeffos a due proportion of
meadow, which by having the command of water may
be eonfiderably increased. The roads are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel and sociable. In fail, exclusive of
an improveable and wellcondifoncd farm, the value and
emolument inseparably ccnnetfled witn a mill, ferries,
fith cries and quarries eligibly fltuated ; the profits ariung
from an ice-house inferior to none in the state, and a gar
den of four acres so abundantly stocked with vegetables
of Jail forts as to :be fully equal to the demand in market,
th-re might be detailed many other advantages, apper;
taining to the fertility of these lands, which the fubferiber
conceives it unhecefTary to mention, being fully convinced
that when examined, it will be found to be a complete,
plea/ant and healthy refidonce, poffettng beauties and
conveniences fuflicieat to attrafl the attention of any pcr
fon desirous of becoming a purchaser.
The motive which induces the fubferiber to offer for
sale an estate so Angularly beautiful and advantageous, is
a desire to become au inhabitant of Alexandria, where he
can with more eafs attend to his interests in the neigh
bourhood of that city
The purchaser may be accommodated with a few slaves
in families, either for plantation or domcftic use. A part
of the purchafc money will be required and the balance
