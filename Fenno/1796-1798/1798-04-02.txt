' PHILADELPHIA,
MONDAY EVENING, April 2.
In the observer, of Dec. 31, a paper of
the firft refpetlsbility, are the following pa
ragraphs refptftiug the threatened invasion
of England.
"We pledge'the veracity for which the
public have given us credit, and which we
(hall fedijloufly endeavor to preserve, that
the armament with which France threatens
to overwhelm this country, does not, nor
for a confidcrable time cannot, comprise a
force worthy our serious alarm.
It is dated, but we know erroneously, to
consist of sixty thousand men. The friends
of Buonaparte are particularly desirous of
its increase, not to attempt the deflru&ion
df this country, but the emancipation, or
at Hart to change the government of iheir
ov.<m Buonaparte who to the gasconades
againfl Britain anfweied not, is the constant
afTociate of the dire&ors Barras and Neuf
chateau, who are opposed by the sanguina
ry promoters of terror, Reubel 8c Mtrlin ;
Lepaux, who is not a man of business, fluc
tuates between the great parties, without
feting attached to either. Barras, whose
genius and enterprize is equal to any at
chievinent, and who is the favorite of the
faif, loses much power by a reputed impet
uosity which overleaps discretion, and which
his adherents, amongst whom are comprised
the Orleans party, dread will injure them :
but this like other parties Barras uses not
for those after whom they are calledâhe
looks to himfclf, and conceives his perman
ent greatness built on the glory of his friend
Buonaparte, whose supreme power he would
establish as the means of his individual con
sequence,âThe ascendancy which the min
illers of vengeance, Merlin and Reubel,
have acquired, may have oecafioned Barras
to look to a second situation.
" We have the most undoubted authority
for Bating the present situation of affairs in
the French metropolis to be such, that im
mediate and important changes are inevita
ble ; each of the hollile faftions croud Pa
ri? with their partizans, and under pretext
of augmenting the levies in the Western
Provinces, draw from the frontiers towards
the capital, such corps as they consider af
feded to their interefts. The ar
my in general is devoted to Barras and his
colleagues. Reubel and his sanguinary as
fociate have a decided majority in the citi
zens of Paris ; indeed, that Buon
aparte, from considerations to his personal
fafety, was prevented from appearing in the
public ftretts.
" The order of the Direftory for recall
ing into the public service the frigates and
smaller veffek lent to the Merchants as pri
vateers, had not been carried into effeft
neither does it appear confident with the
purpose or ability of the French government
to make any efficient exertion for the re-es
tablishment of their mariqe."
j-
EXTRACT.
The real state of France is this. She is in
open hofliiity with the Eli'lifh nation on ac
count of their predominant maritime power.
France and England are the modern rival pow
ers, Rome and Carthageâthe one determined
on the reduflion of the ether's power. This ia
not a new competition j it has fubfif) d for cen
turies. The inveterate enmity of republican
France tswjrd. Great-Britain is but a continul.
tion of a ipirit of rivalry which has appeared,
under the monarchy, from the Noiman conquest
âsometimes a little moderated by peace and
commerce, but never extin<3. The victories
of the French armies have revived a projedl Â«f
invasion, which his before been often contem
plated and as often laid aside.
But jhÂ« plan of tieftroying the power of
Great Britain, by drying up the sources of her
wealth, is now pushed further than any of the
mwiartbs of France ever dared to attempt No
king, even the mod ahfolute, ever ventured to
enter the houses of private citizens and seize
Bruifh made goods. No despot in Europe could
accomplish such an aÂ£).
Nor would any of the monarchs of EurÂ»pe
dare to go so far in contempt of all the rules of
nations, as to violate any neutral flag and make
it confifcable, merely for carrying the of
a particular nation. Defpotifni like this can
not be axercifed by kingsâit is reserved exclu
sively for Frenchmen.
But; this propofitiori is generalâ'it extends to
confifc'ate the vessels of Sweden and Dmraark,
as well as ef the United Statesâyet the Swedes
and Danes, have formed no league with Great-
Britain, to offend France. This is nothing hut
a pretext. The real truth is, France is deter
mined on wounding England, through her com
merce ; Ike therefore cannot refpe<9 our trade,
whi' h takes 2 or 9 millions sterling per annum
of Britilh goods. To be at war with British
man nfa flu res, it is necessary to be at war witn
American commerce ; and this would have
been the cafe, if the treaty had never existed.
AN ECDOTE OF DENNIS',THE CRITIC.
Amongst the Angularities of this learned
felf-tormentor, he either hatrd or affefted to
hate a fun .so much, that he either grew
outrageously angry, or quitted the company
whenever a pun happened to be let off in his
presence.
With this well known prejudice against
him, the wits of his time constantly availed
(herefelvei . One night in particular, at
Button's, Steele wanted to make a party
without Dennis, though he could not de
cently do it, as Dennis was in the Coffee
houfe at the fame time ; ruminating for some
time how to get rid of him, be at last ob
served Rowe fitting at the opposite fide of
the fame box, when coming op to Dennis ke
afktd him aloud, what was "the matter with
Urn TâThe matter with me,' fays Dennis,
PHILADELPHIA:
what da you mean by that !' Why,' fays
Steele, â¢ I did not know ; but you appear
to me to be like an angry waterman ; you
look one way, and Rowe another."
Thiswas enough for ourangry critic, who
immediately bounced up. and left'the roorp,
thundering his anathemas against all puns
and miserable punsters.
ON THE SUBJECT OF ARMING.
From the Columbian Centinel.
To the writer of the piece Jtgned " A REPUB
LICAN," in ihelafl Chronicle.
Sir,
I AM aware that small indeed is the num
ber, who are to be misled by the artful and in
cendiary mode which you choose to adopt, in
or d r o roul'e the oppofitim of the people a
gainfl the in ended plan of arming, as it is call
ed. Our countrymen are too enlightened nor
to fee through thefhallozv artifice, and are too
much attached to tkuth not to <\t(<p'\fefalfhood.
Yet it may h- of nfe to expose your misftate
mentof farat.d your falfe inferences.
Youprofcfa to enquire into the cause, which
urges ws to arm for felf defence and fay, "by
'lie late arrrtf of the French directory, all Bri
tish manufactures are liab e to capture, found on
board neutral fhipsand then, as if you had
r c ted the whole decree, and that decree the on
ly cause, you ask with an air of triumph, " will
the people of America involve themselves in
all the calamities of war, for the purpose of
protecting Hi itifh manufaiWes ?" Now this,
Mr. Republican, is rather t e fliwfy ; had you
not known that the truth woul not anfweryour
purppfe, you would have mentioned, as an im
portant pari of the decree, " that every vejftl
laded with the produce or men hinaize of Eng
land, or any of iis pojjeffions, is decreed a law
ful prize, whoever be the proprietors of said
produce, &c " âand then, if you had the reel
ings of an American, you would have alked no
other cause for the intended plan of defence. If
a merchant (hip with a valuable cargo of foreign
.ioods, and only a single bale of English manu
failures, or a firgle hogshead of rum, the pro
duce of a British Island, ft oÂ»ld reSft a privateer
â¢ f the dii edlory, woul 1 it be in defence of bri
tjh manufaSures ; or to prevent the arbitrary
condemnation of a valuable fliip and cargo ? Is
not the number of vessels rtgnlarly employed in
importing British manufactory small indeed,
compared to the humber of such as would be
condemned under this- decree, for having acci
dentally on board some trilling article, the man
lafaflure of England ? For French patriotism
will no doubt ftnfllv conform to thefpirit as
well as the letter of this decree.
But. Sir, y u well know that it is rot solely
i . consequence of this arret', a birrary and un
warrantable as it is, that we re called upon to
arm. The hostile condudt of the 'iretSlory to
tnis country, is of an older date , you, fir, in
0n..: on with others, have long fern the viola
t on ot the in. f! â¢' mn treaties ; you know that
the ports of France are thrnnge with American
veffeis, carried in under the most wicked pre
tences ; you know that condemnation follows
almofl every capture ; you know that the
wharves and streets of Bourdeaux, Nantz, Ha
vre, &c are crow fed with American seamen
thrown out of employ; and dependent on their
eon&ils, for the means of returning to their fam
ilies ; you know that scarce a aper ifiues from
our prefles that is not filled vith a mehncholy
iifl of captures and condemnations, in the
Fr nch Weft In ies and in Spanish ports obse
quious lo tlit will of the directory ; and in ma
ny inftancps attended with circumstances of ill
ulage to the captain and seamen, which a state
of war would not juftify, and a savage would
b v.fh to iriflifl. A
You hnow that these things not only daily
take place abroad, but'aggrefiions equally hor
rible, are brought to our d'>orÂ»: we fee our val
uable homeward bound merchantmen captured
within view of their destined ports ; we fee our
mariners, after encountering the perils of a
long and boiflerous voyage from the rcmoteft
parts of the other hemisphere, and within a few
leagues of our shores, dragged to some of the
French poflefiions, and there turned out of their
vefiels with the mortification of feeing the valu
able property of the merchants, and their own
hard earnings condemned for want of a " role
d equipage," or some pretence equally unwar
rantable. You know rhÂ«t within the part year,
a valuable English ship and cargo were burnt
within thejunfdifli m of these Sates, and with
in the familuary of the harbor of Charleftan.
(Whatever you may think, its being English
does not lefien the insult.) Unhappily, a thou
sand other instances of aggrefiion might be ad
ded.
The stagnation of onr commerce, and the
consequent partial distress introduced into our
large toivns, is the result of these complicated
outrages Knowing these things to be true ;
hww, fir, can you have the effrontery to tell the
people of America, that to arm is only to pro.
teiS British m<nu:i(slory. Who of theChron
i.-le readers, with all the pains you have hereto
fore taken to mislead them are foola enough to
believe you. You fay to arm means the fame as
to make war. You k.iow, fir, that it has been
the invariable policy of our administration, to
avoid war ; you know tr.at Â«ve y true American
inuft advocate such policy, and it is in vain that
you attempt to make people believe, that those
who have the m ill to lufe are ad ocates tor war.
It is pertciAly natur. I that you, and othep of
the fame sentiments wish you, when you fee the
crtfis to whi. h your blind adulation of the French
and the iriilreprcfentations of your piity have
brought your country ; whrn papers like the
Chronicle h-ve jufiified alike every decree iflu
ing from the direÂ«Â£lory. I fay it is natural that
before the evil arrives, you should attempt to
throw the odnim of making war (Oiould such
be the confequerice of our system ot defence)
on the admimflration, and thus parry ihe resent
ment ot an iujuied t eople. Tou know, fir, al
though you itifinuate the contrary, that our go
vernment do not \rifh a war ; but if the direc
tory, because we arm our merchantmen and for
tify our coafls, to prevent in f .ture loine of the
aggrefiions I have belme re- ited, choo'e o eilj
to make war, I trull there is not an American
jvho will flirink from the danger ; for if there
ever was a cafe in hich a nation uould be j un
ified in rtpe ling f>rce by force it woul t be then.
We might then lay our hands on out hearts as
we did in 17 75, and dppeul to Heaven
The ptoplewill not*' involve themselves in a

land." But the people of America, fir, be
lieve me, will with the fame uianimity and
ci U! age which they difpL-yed in lhaking oft our
colonial f'jbjeflion to Great Britain, repel the
attempts of France or any other ruti >n to re
duce us again to the condition of colonies;
thty have no more inclination to become French
cnlonifts than they had to continue Britilh colo
nics j and as in the one inrtance Providence
crowned their virtuous efforts with successâso
ftlould the occalion arrive there is little rea/bn tÂ»
fear that the fame prowess wosld terminate as
gloriously lor our country. As to the 50,c00,"e0
lir, the for which we once contended was
lo great, that wifely we did not count the cost ;
so I presume the cafe contemplated, no merce
nary confidcration would prevenl our vigorous
ly defending those rights which we once tho't
ourselves bound to hand inviolate to our poller
ity.
The yeomanry to whom yeu so often address
yourlelf, know that whether their produce lays
c.n hand liecatife the country is at war, or be
cause the merchants are deterrad from shipping
it for fear of French captures, the consequence
to them is the fame. If our merchants are al
lowed so arm there will be fooie chance at lealt
that Ibme may gÂ» clear.
You alk, will the sailors enter on board A
merican armed veffe Â», and fubjeil themselves
to the loss of their limbs to help a gang of Bri
tilh importers. Sailors, I fay, will mere read
ily enter i n bo rd vcffrls so armed as to give
them some chance of escaping capture and im
prisonment, than on board unprotected veffcls,
where there is every probability of capture, and
an absolute ceitainty of ill ulage.
You fay the Tories have for many years been
anxious to destroy the friend/hip between France
an J the United Stafs, and that the liritilh trea
ty was predicated and adopted on this princi
ple. I was lofs to know who you meant
by Tories until vog explained by meatii ning
WASHING l O'M and ADAMS. Andthele,
fir, ire the men you dare to call Tories ; and
can you believe thai any body is ftupU enough
to liflen to your calumnies against such men as
these? If they are Tories, who would not be
proud of the title ? No praise of m ne can ex
alt them above the high rank they hold in the
estimation of the virtuous and good in all coun
tries ; and be assured that no Jlnnder of yours
can rob them of the smallest portion of their
well earned fame. You fay, Mr. Adams waÂ»
tainted with the glare and pomp of St. James's.
! This absurd cant is not novel from the mouth
:of political fanatics. Why was he not tainted
I with the much greater glare of the court of Ver
sailles ? We fee him there with his excellent col
league Mr. Jay, baffling the intrigues of the
count de VergennÂ¥3 and the more dangerous
opposition of Dr. Franklin, until by their
firmnefi alone we obtained the acknowledgment
of our independence, the enlargement of our
territory, our right to the fifheries and other
bleflings which that instrument secured to us.
Your observation on Mr. Adams's advance
ment of his son is ton scurrilous almolt to be
noticed, if some fallhood was not blencdd with
it which (hould he expo r ed. He did not give
his son diplomatic honors ; hit talents had bro't
him forward to the notice of the late President,
and HE appointed him relident in Holland i he
has been removed fiom thenee to Berlin, as it
was important to renew our treaty with the king
of Pruflia, which was near expiring. Who
more pr-per to execute that million than Mr.
Adams, who was nearer that court than anyo
j th r public minister of the United States : and
! without disparagement to any of our foteign
! ministers, it may be truly said, that his coiip
j try cannot boast a more faithful, upright and
â  abiefervant in the diplomatic lilt than our pre
; lent miriilt rat rferlin. You fay thai within
two years Mr. Adams and his son have received
80, coo dollars*. It is a fuflicierit answer to
this inlinuation that the President receives ?he
fame, and no greater compensation than the for
mer President, and the mimfter at Berlin the
firns and n" greater than any other HiiniUer ple
nipotentiary.
The conclusion of your piece being on
ly a repetition of the jingle about British
manufa&ures, yeomanry, &c. I (hall pass
over.
And now, fir, I shall take leave of you
for this time. If you are not so hardened
in the habit of reviling every thing that is
good, and so addifted to falfe rcprefenta

you to thinlc seriously of the part you are
afting. The time is approaching and per
' haps is not far distant, when the people will
look around them to find out their real ene

people of your description, who with the
words patriot and liberty in their mouths,

They will discover that s fo-wer of feditien

to theiÂ£ polit'cal existence, whatever he may

Mr. Dunning,
The threat of the far tamed Lyon, that
through the instrumentality of newspapers
he would revolutionize Conne&icut, it ap
pearslie has began to put in execution, and
your Gazette has the honor of commencing
the projected operations. You williiiftant

that extract, .tjian reasonable raÂ«n would ex

of Hickory, and goaded on by paflions in
flamed by disappointment, and the hope of
revenge. If, however, Lyon is resolved to
spit his venom upon us and occasion an uni
versal hydrophobia, it is time for men of
moderation to oppofc him, by unveiling his
artifices, and ex puling hismifreprefentationa.

MONDAY EVENING, APRIL 2, 1798.
Party prfidudious bear the plain im
press of. partiality, deceit and diflortion.
None will be imposed on by them, but kin
dred fculs, and those who from their local
situations or habits have not intelligence of
what passes at this eventful day.
traS is the true and legitimate offspring, of
the affcciated club of diforganizers, who ex
ert themselves to bring the government of
this country into contempt,to palsy i'.s
efforts, to degrade its dignity, and to un
dermine and dellroy its cor.ftitution. It is
against the supporters of this palladium of
our fafety and happiritfs,âthe men, who
determined to rfiove in their own sphere only
are equally resolved not to infringe upon the
power of others, that their vindi&ive, rel
iefs malice is ever exerted.
If resort be had to the principle, of hu
man nature, we find a constant diTpofition
to enlarge our own privileges, rights, pow
ers and pleasures, and to diminish the oppo
sing privileges, rights, powers, aud plea
sures of others.âlt is this principle that has
occasioned such a mifpenfe of money and of
time, in tie Federal Legiflnture. But ac
cefiions of force have been derived to it,
from other fourets- Originally, the hope
of escaping payment of debts jultly due to
Brftiftv creditors, made our louthern bre
thern warm patriots. The flour speculation
of Randolph (and would to God that was
the only one entered into tothe'injury of our
country) had a very republican effe<ft,'Â° ll him
and his party. To purfut 'he fubjedt would
be a talk both tiresome and invidisus. The
fame republican party Hill complain, of the
I extention of power by the executive, and
; that the part of Congreftf usually denomin
ated federal, are in a conspiracy against the
people, surrendering up the rights of the
popular branch of government, and volunta
rily committing suicide on their own powers and
privileges. This compliment from the sons
of liberty vi\\o tyrannize over their thousands of
Jlaves, is too opposite to human{nature, the
experience of mankind, ancLthi? obfrrvations
of the calm and patriotic, to deserve a feri
i ous refutation No,âit is the sincere de
' termination of men, who rci"p'eÂ£t the -will of
the people as declared in the federal confti
! tution and who will not enlarge their own
powers at the expence of robbing the exe
cutive of the powers delegated to him, that
occasions th<- malevolent aspersions of the
j diforganizer.
I When offices are (hewn to be unconjiitu
: tionally and unnecejfctrily created, it will be
time to alarm the people, with the cry of
Governmental influence. âWould the Lyon
have no edablifhments,âneither army, na
vy, or minidcrs ?âWould he banish all ex
pences, and every appointment that will
occasion them ?âlf this is his objeft, mod
clearly he meditates the overthrow of gov
ernment. The enquiry ever mull be, whe
ther eftabliftiments are made unconjlitutionally
and unneceffitrily. The various edablifhments
of Government are the wheels on which it
moves. If they are not multiplied beyond
ptility, to diminish them is to cripple gov
ernment, and that this is the real objett of
many afairfpoken diforganizer, none but
the ignorant or demoniac will doubt.
The federal party in Congress,âthe
champions of the federal constitution, are
the men whom the Lyon wou'd Itigmatize, as
friends to the Executive, and enemies to the
people.âAway with this idle' cant, that the
speaker himfeif does not believe.âls it im
pofiible that men of understanding and hon
elty, should approve of governmental mea
sures ? One political opinion so reducible to
a Certain dandard that none but a fool or
villain can differ from the opinion formed by
by honed men ? Mud the man who supports
the executive, be an enemy to the people ?
The answer to these qutttions,âthe reply
which every man of discernment not warped
by prejudice, by intcreft, or by influence
has anticipated is, No.
If then men of underdanding and hon
esty, may approve of the meatures of go
vernment ; if there is 110 standard to which
you can bring political opinions ; if an hon
ed man may approve ps the measures of the
Executive, what reason is there to brand
with dilgrace those who support the federal
executive ?
Are they not equally intereded in the pros
perity of our common country, as those who
exclaim against them ? Have they not from
their responsible situation, an additional mo
tive to fidelity ? Are not their property, fa--
milies, and friends all embarked in the federal
vessel, and wiH the enlightened mind fuf
peft that they mean to fink or destroy her ?
Shall the yellow tinge of a narrow suspicious
mind be transfnfed into their faces, and dis
color them ? But perhaps they want abili
ties and the Lyon's opportunities of infor
mation. Then, it is not unufua! for con
ceited men, who have an immoderately high
jpinion of themselves, to miltake the biff

But does the Lyon really believe, that

unintermitted complaints against our admini

of conserving harmony witS the Fre.ich Re

to procure good '.reatment ? does he not

the impartial and good, will admire. They
will view him as beirtg, ereft, calm, looking

ABRIDGEMENT OE
THE -STATE OF POLITICKS.
FOR 1 HIS WEEK.
London, Jan. 6.
HAVING already, in an address to the
readers of this paper, in our number for
Tuesday hft, taken a glanee at the general
alfpcct of' 97, as seen by the eye of a Briton,
we (hall not iufift much further on that fub
jeft at this time thaa just to fay, that, at
the commencement of 1798, Great Britain
finds herfelf in a situation of equal difficulty
and novelty ; of difficulty,inafmuch as (hehas
to contend (ingle handed, against a neigh
bouring power, the mod 'formidable for
ijumWers, and various ttratagems of policy
and war, that has appeared in modern times,
perhaps that ever appeared in the world ;
of novelty, Uecaufe we are now, by the to
tal difTolution of the Confederation, and the
new arrangements and diflributions agreed
on between France aod Aullria in Germany
wholly isolated from the continent, and re
stored to the situation in which we flood be
fore the accession of King William 111. or
rather in the reign of Charles I.Â»â This ar
duous (late us affairs we by no means consi
der as an inauspicious commencement of the
year. It has, und.,ubtedly, a tendency to
unite us in council and adtipn ; to moder
ate the heats ar.d aninr.ofities of contending
parties and fadions in Parliament ; and to
call forth, and diredt with proper energy,
the resources and (Irength of the country.
Several proofs of such. aiudcration have been
given in the course of the lall recess of Par
liament, in which pretensions to personal
preferment were facrificed to the inurells of
the State ; and offers were made of support
without any,participation in any arrange
ments that should be formed of such men
['Volume XIII.and on such principles, as night ga.il the
general confidence of the italioH. Ihe
design alluded to proved abortive ; neverthe
less, the magammity and patriotiim evinced j
are equally intitled to our piaife, as if
it had been carried into execution. If the
French should dare to make their appearance
airmngH us, ihe fprrit of moderation and
mutual cohceflion would become general,
the will* of all be united, and and arm of
Grrat-Britain irrefiflahle. _ 11
Preparations are still going forward in n
France, for i/ivading some part of Great 1,
Britain or Ireland ; the real objeft of these a
is still a fu! jest of doubt and varimts con
jefture. But, for our part*, it does not f
appear quite certain to i*s, that the often-
fible objeft is not the real one, or at haft ],
that it will not, in the end, turn out to be ;
the real one ;,for whatever may be the pri- J
vate views of the Diredlory, arid their par- t
ty, the spirit of adventure and plunder once t
ex' ited can nÂ«t be easily laid ; nor is it
impoiiible for French invention, direfted to v
one to contrive some means of elu- j
ding our fleets, and landing troops on our n
Â«oa!lÂ» Though they have not a navy, they r
have, ar msy fooÂ«i, proiure abundance of r
floating timber ; yet whether in huge rafts,
or floating 1(1 inds of wood, or in row-boats, ,
they would be exposed to many difficulties [
and dangers arising from natural causes, and [
to various modes of annoyance and attack
on the part of this nation ; and, on the j
whole, there is no realon for entertaining }
the smallest apprehenfiÂ»n that their expedi- ,
tion would be fuccefsful. 1

Th'.fe countries, one day, and that per

We fee but a very fliort wsy indeed into ,

limrit would lay their heads together, and
not in vain, for paicelling out the bed part
of Europe as they please ? Let us not fup
pofethat theprefent maniac energyof France
will be'perpetual : the French,left to them

unfortunate that they were united for so

to have been, on a large view, very impoli

Mr. Brooks again complained of the f
insinuation which Mr. Gilts had thrown jÂ°
out against him, which he said was not cal- (
ltd for by any circumllance under cotifider- f ;,
ation. lit
Mr. Giles allured him he mefitioned the or
faft alluded to out of no difrefpeef to him. ar
With refpeft to the date of Mr. Monroe's le
letter, he hid been deceived by a leaf be
ing folded down at the letter whose date be w
had mentioned- The gentleman had laid ol
that he had attributed improper motives to
the Prelident of the United States. This c :
he denied. He had said, he took meafuies j'
which he did not approve, and he hoped a
difference of opinion from any man, would c |
not be imputed to him as a crime. With d
refpeft to the explanation which jhe gentle- p
man had given of his own conduft he was 01
glad to hear it. It was to obtain this
nation, that he mentioned the reports which
he had heard. Mr. G. renewed his after- w
tion that he and his friends always had been it
willing to put the nation in a Hate of de- F
fence. As to the frigates, Ire gloried in P
his vote against them j but with refpeel to j'
the ufe(of them, the gentleman jwas mifta- w
ken. They were intended to be sent against b
the Algerines only. r;
Mr. Si Smith said a few words as to the b
statements whicfr had been made with re- v
fpeti to the amount of our exports to dif- "
ferent countries : that made by the gentle
man from Virginia, he said, was correft, v
except that some deduilion onjht to be S
made frsm the 36 millions on account of the
hanfe fr-vns. l
tfr. NrcHOLAS made some remarks as 0
to the date of Mr. Monroe's letter. Tho' t
the date Was as stated by the gentleman j
from S. Carolina, he (till maintained that t-
Mr. Monroe could not have known whether 1 J
or not the Senate had ratified the British i t
treaty. Mr. N. hoped the committee would 1
rile, and that he should be permitted to t
fiiew the consequences of a war with France f
at this time. He said yesterday he should t
have been frilling to have overlooked the c
pad, and to have taken the bell mode of , c
getting out of our present fituatioa ; but : J
when gentlemen fay that all has been done ; .
by this government that could have âbeen, ; ,
he should confidtr it as treason to his conn- i
try not to fliew that the present mifunder- '
Handing with the French republic was fouti- 1
ded in our own mifcondud. Not that we
were wrong in faying we will not bear the
treatment of the French since ; for though
he thonght we gave the firit offence, yet 1
he was not for bearing the chastisement of 1
any country.
After a few words betwixt Mr. Dayton
and Mr. Nicholas, as to the objett of the
amendment, the committee rose.
CALL UPON THE PRESIDENT.
Friday, March 30.
MR. ALLEN having proposed the fol
lowing resolution :
" Resolved, That the Prefidcnt of the United
States be requested to communicate to this house,
the dispatches from the Envoys Extraordinary of
the United States to the French Republic, men- ;
tioned in his message ot the 19th inft.
or fucb parts thereof as configurations of public fafety
and interefly in bis opinion, may permit."
Mr. S. Smith said, he Ihould have no ob-
to the resolution, if the latter part of
it was struck out. If the President thought
it neceflTary that any part of the correspon
dence ought to be kept secret, he would, as is
usual in such cases, inform the House that this
wa the cal'e, and the galleries would Â«c
---cordingly be cleared. The communication
would then, probably be referred to a felett
committee, and iuch parts of it publilhed, as
might appear proper.
Mr. Allen observed, that there might be
' parts of this correspondence which it would
not be proper to communicate to this House,
even confidentially. If this was not the cafe,
the Prelident could (till communicate such
part of the correspondence in confidence as he
may think proper. He wilhed to leave the
Prelident to ait according to his discretion.
Without some portion of this discretion be
ing allowed him, the government could not
proceed.
Mr. Giles said, no part of the correspon
dence ought to be kept from Congress. He
1 was not himfelf fatisned as to the (incerity of
1 the proceedings of the Executive of the Uni
ted States towards France; he wished, there
fore, not only to have the correspondence of
our ministers, but the inllructions which were
given to thein. Mr. G. defended what he
had yeflerday said about the President and
these papers; and hoped if the House called
forthe papers at all, they would call forall the
papers, and the inltructions upon which our
ministers acted.
Mr. Livingston moved to amend the re
solution, by llriking out all the words after
the 19th infhint, ami insert after the words
"this House" the injlruftjms 10 an<l.** This
' j was not a time, Mr. L. (aid, to (hind upon
-lon ordinary oQcalions. They were now cal
j led upon to fay whether the country be
preserved in peace, or go to warj H ye.t.Xhe cor
respondence which ought to "convince the
House of the propriety of adting itvthis or that
way, is withheld. How could tie} fay to
e , the.r constituents, without this inltjr at on,
! all has been done that could be done :o pre
lerve the country in peace, but war ijfa.s ine
! vitable ! And.if war is rushed in'O headlong,
1 without due consideration, and consequently
j without afcertaifting whether it isjuftor not,
' can it be expected that the wilhes and aids of
' the people will be heartily engaged in such a
war ? They certainly would not.
It would be 110 answer, to fay thai our nego
tiation with a foreign power would, by this
!, means, be expoled. The communication
. might be made with clofediloors, and no one
could l'tippcfe any thing would be exposed
by tke members of the legislature, which the
good of the country requires to be kept se
cret. But gentlemen wish this House to re
pose the strictest confidence in one branch of
1. the government, at the fame time that they
r- fay no confidence can be placcd-in the inte
grity of this House. [Mr. Allen exclaim-
Ed; ttimfaid tt J] Mr. L. replied, that this tiip<
was u fair inference troru what had been said. belt
The latter part of thS resolution proposed den
to transfer a right to the President,' which it is in
ought itfelf to cxercife, as to judging of wdiat will
it was proper to publifli in Ccmlideration ot the , tori;
public fafety and interest.* It tiiis.power was corr
given to the President, he might withhold refp
inch parrs of the papers, as might prevent, a voti
correct judgment being formed upon them, oft
He was not hiiufelt d;(poled to cede to the poli
President the riglvt, which he was sent there [lie
to exercise for his constituents, of judging of thai
so important a question as a question ot peace the;
or war. He could not basely surrender this try
fight. If the papers were called for at all, tod
he hoped, tlie whole would be called for, in obji
â¢ order that the House might orm that found not
and temperate judgment for which the pre- N
( sent cri(is sb loudly calls, and for which the t!en
people of the United States anxioitfly look, upo
Indeed to pal's the resolution unamended, ta.ui
: would, in his opinion,be a (hameful direliCtion cou
1 of their right-. < l I"
i Mr. Bay ard thought the propriety of this mta
- call upon the Prelirienrwasexuemely-doubt- ipp
s fill, and as it regarded the lurtruttious given the
s to our m!iiifieri, wholly improper. With -vhi
1 refpeiit to the communication of t|ie difpat- pla
eties, it <vas wholly a matter of Executive bet
t discretion to judge whether it would be pro- cell
. per to commun cate them,'or not. He was bet
s one of those Who had so much confidence in pof
the Executive as to trull to his candour, tin- to |
derltanding and integrity, to determine upon mit
1 the propriety of what hg Ih'juld fend to ; or He
- withhold from this House. At a time when the
l it is not known that our negotiation with Un
- France is closed, it would be extremely im- Vu
, prudent to have the inltmetions to ourminif- doi
} ters laid before this house, as what was sent (he
here, notwithstanding any vote of fecrefv, act
" would not long be kept secret. It would soon wa
' be in Europe, and might do us efTential inju- ran
ry, by difcloliitgourtlltiination 10 France, and do.
; by (hewing it alio to the world. It was in poi
vain, Mr. B. said, to suppose that one him- net
dred tfien could keep a iecret for any length po
of time, however important it might be. To noi
elucidate that afTenion, he referred to the di- cej
> vulging the secret of the British tfeaty by a |on
e Senator. | fid
c But the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Dei
Gii h.s) has no confidence in the government ! wa
of this country with refpeft to its negociation
' with France ; and in order to try the finceri- the
ty of the Executive, he wishes tor these pa- ' tec
n pers. Does the gentleman, by this, mean to iap
t . give the lie to the Executive > Because in in
r i his mefTage he has told the House that he has be
h I given power to our MinisterS to fettle our di(- de
j putes with the French Republic and to "make th
I all reasonable concellions." What more does tai
0 I the gentleman wish > Does he wilh unrea- fin
e fonable conceilions to be made ? Surely he tli
d | does not. Did any thing appear in the con- op
e j duct of the French Direttory to (hew that nc
our. Ministers were not poflelTed of ample m
|t I powers ! No ; the Directory never knew any th
I thing about tiieir powers, at lead so far as ot
|C ! any official communications had been receiv
ed on the fubjett. There could not, there- nc
I- . fore, be any ground upon which the gentle- Pi
l- man rould reft his suspicions. He hoped, be
therefore, theamendment would be negatiVed. h;
rÂ£ Two or three gentlemen were on the floor ni
together. w
"J The Speaker said, the amendment to jn- fa
" fert the inftruClions to and, would come fir ft tli
ft under conlideration. it
jf j Mr. Harper said, he did not mean, at ol
| this time, to enter int > the merits of the pre- b<
n sent queltion. It was important and present- ei
ed itfelf in anew light tÂ« the house. The Ii
le original motion he was ready to have voted ai
for j he did not know whether he might not tl
vote for this. But he wished time to consider p
of it. He therefore moved the fartherconfi- tl
deration ot this question to be postponed till tl
Monday. n
1- Mr. Allen had no objeftion to the port- u
ponement, except the mover oÂ£ the amend- si
j ment, would permit it to be amended by a g
j. i modification of this fort, " Such parts of those b
injlruftions as 'were communicated to the French V
, n _ Government." ' u
The question for postponement was put and w
â  ct 1 carried 47 to 41. j b
The order of the day was then called for. j d
Mr. A llen hoped, since the consideration n
1 of his proposition had been postponed, the a
Â° j house would not lefolve itfelf into a commit- i n
; tee ot the whole on the State of the Union, un- ! v
n .~ 1 til this information Was received. The debate c
|! s of yesterday, he thought would do no good, e
,as it served only to alarm the public mind, 0
**" and he expedted if the house went into a com
mittee to-day, the time would be spent asun- v
: profitably. g
as Mr. Brooks seconded the motion, as the a
information called for would certainly throw v
, j light upon the fubjedt ; and though he had t
1 himfelf fufficient information to enable him
' e > to vote upon the question, many gentlemen, i
' in the course of the debate, had made a great t
I hue and try after these papers, he hoped there- I
le fore they would be called for. 1
Mr, Nichola salways thought it proper to i
,n ' ask for further information on this subject; t
)e ~ but as he had been told that when it was re- v
,ot csived, it would be final as to our atlairs with f
France, and tantamou.it to war, he thought t
it better to decide the question whether we are 1
ready to go to war, or not, firft. He wished t
this, alf'o, to prevent the consequences which t
nl " are now taking place from a general imprefti- (
re ~. on in the country, from the late meflage of t
ot the President, that we niuft be involved in i
ere War. In confequeijce of this perfuaiion, he f
Â® had received information that produce has fall- *
'j en one-fourth in price. He wifhud, therefore, t
Â® to come to a vote as soon as possible that (liould I
ie decide the question of peace or war. It was I
aur upon this ground that he did not call for the '
papers, and upon this ground, he hoped they 1
rc " ihoiild proceed with the business. Delaymay t
â¢ f Â® r give time formealnres to be taken which fliall '
(tab the peace of the country ; which may go i
beyond the powers of the legislature to arielt I
1011 their progress. If the |>uftnefs ot the Union <
'P~ was to be suspended until the call was made, '
"J it must also be suspended until the call is an- i
" e fwered ; and if it be favorably answered, un- <
or " tiHhe communications are printed. He hop- 1
! ed, therefore, this delay would not take place. I
at Mr. Baldwin said, if gentlemen could 1
to reconcile it to their own minds to let this im- ]
on > portant business lie over from day to day, it
rc " was more than he could do. He was surprised
" e " to si id at firll some reluttancje to go into a '
n 8Â» committee .of the whole on the State of tlie 1
lt 's r Union ; and he was now surprised that there 1
,ot '. was any reluitance to proceed with the bufi
sot ness. He would not indulge suspicions as to 1
a motives ; but he begged thein to believe that
he could not help cxprefiing his anxiety at the 1
BÂ°." profpett of any delay in coming to a decision 1
thls on the question which had already undergone '
I>on some difculTion. He had never seen the affairs
Â° n( : of this country on such a dangerous precipice 1
)( f" as at present,"and not to ait, but let things 1
' c alone, and the country will soon be in war, 1
,e " and then we must defend ourselves as well as
re * we can. At lead, this was his view of the I
'Â°' matter. But, if the business be pursued at J
' ,c y present, though we find France has behaved i
) ,e " towardstis, so as to give us a just ground for 1
im * war, yet if we wish to avoid war, this is tlie i
time to prevent it. The fubjefl is at present it 1
before tlie house in the way which the Preli- I pr c
dent thought proper to place it ; and if a call ma
is made for papers, it is well known that lie pet
will not be obliged to fend them. Thein- mil
. formation which they had he himfelt supposes [ U F
correct, as the President had given it upon his I,l '
refponlibility ; he was, therefore, ready to re A
vote upon the question before the committee tha
of the whole. He believed there was a dis
position in the country for peace, and against pi'
the arming of merchant veflels. vol
that by taking pointud and decilive measures, 1Â»
they had on a former occalion, keptthecoun- noi
try out of war ; he hoped they would be able ac l
to do it on the prefentoccafion. He should no on
objeft to calling for the papers; but wished c 'ji
not to protract the business.
Mr. Gordon was surprised to hear gen
tlemen fay the house was called upon to aft
upon the opin onot the President, there is cef*- th.
tajnly something more before the house He ce<
could not account tor the opposition made to 1 ha
a postponement except it was,Â»that when the of
nfjrmatibn was obtained gentlemen were bu
ipprehenlive they coiild not hold the langnags l' e
they now hold, as almost every geollemÂ»n gd
who had spoken upon the subjeCt, had com- be
plained that fufficient information was not u"
before them. If this information was unne- do
relfary, then tiie refolutian ought to have A
been negatived at once ; biy having been of
postponed, he thought it would be Improper pi
to proceed with the question before the com- (o
mittee of the whole, until it was received. D
He saw 110 reason, therefore, for going into fa;
the committee of the whole onthe (late of the ha
Union, except to give the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) an o irtiinity ot D
doing what he has proposed tu Jo, viz. to afi
(hew to the world thai our Government has- in
acted improperly towards France; but such di
wa> his opinion of that gentleman's perfeve â¢ cr
ranee, that if he did not get an opportunity ot th
doing this to-day, he would take another op
portunity of doing it,'and therefore it was not de
neceHary to go into a committee for the pur- to
pofc of receiving hs speech ; and he,con Id U
1 not fee for what else it could be desired, ex- ej
cejit it was that gentlemen wilhed still to hold w
1 ' out to the people the idea, that there is a con- in
I fidc rable yarf of this house, with the Prefi- (a
dent at their head, for war, though the charge in
t ' was altogether denied. Â°'
1 But the gentleman from Virginia, fays that m
. the late meirage of the President has so a'gita- v '
: ted the public mind, that believing war is tli
> approaching, produce has fallen one fourth
\ in price. If the fafl was as stated, he did not m
s believe it had been the Meflage of the Prefi
. dent which had produced it, but the decree ot
; the French Directory, as the MefTage con
s tained nothing like war. He thought the in- 1
. finuation injurious to the President, and to b
: tliofe who thought with him, and who were K
- opposed to war, but who, nevertheless, will Si
t not vote for the resolution before the com
: mittee of the whole, because they do not leel _
y theiufelves called upon to decide the question
s of Peace or War at present. r
Mr. Dana was against: the postponement,
. not because he thought the meflage of the
. President had caused the fall of produce â
i, because that Meflage would certainly .have
. had no such effett, had it not been accompa
,r nied by a decree of the French Directory,
which went to let loose all the French cor
. fairs upon all Neutral veflels, and to exclude
ft them from French ports. This, he believed
it was which had produced the effect spoken
it of. But he did not think of the resolution
before the committee of the whole was adopt
t- ed, that it would raise the price of produce,
ie Indeed, he did not think it would produce
:d any effeft. He considered it as an unmeaning
at thing; and a person voting for it, might with
Â»r propriety go into every measure prspofed for
i. the defence of the country. It was one of
,11 those vague propositions upon which gentle- j
men may fay what they please, and he looked f
h upon it as introduced with that view. And _
I- since they must submit to hear the fpeechesof j
a gentlemen upon the occasion-, he wished the
)f e business to be going on. The gentleman from
J c h Virginia told the committee yesterday, that he
would them a fpeeclrto-day, wherein lie
id would (hew rtiat this country had been to
1 blame in refpeft in France, in which, he
j doubted not, they should be entertained with
in many severe phillippicsagainft the Executive ;
he all these l'peeches, calculated to raise a cla
t- j mour in tlie country must be submitted to. He
II- I wished therefore, to go from day today into a
ite committee of the whole, until gentlemen had
d, exhausted themselves, and then tUe business
d, of the Nation might be proceeded with.
n- Mr. Brooks said, for the fame reason
n- which his friend from Connecticut gave for
going into the order of the day, he wished to
he avoid it ; because he hoped, if till Monday
jw was given for the gentleman to consider upon
ad the matter, he would give up his speech.
im Mr. Gallatin. In whatever he had said
â n, in the Sommittee of the whole on the ftateof
;at the Union, he had made no allusion to the pa
e- pcrs, a call for which had been proposed. If
he understood the objections urged to going
to into a committee of the whole on the date of
:t; the Union, it was, that the house ought to
e- wait until these papers were before thein- So
ith far as related to himfelf, this was unneceflary,
ht tor he had not complained of any want on this
ire head. Not because he did not desire to have
ed the information, if it could be obtained ; but
ch becaule he thought it bed, under the present
Ti- fituation'of this country, firft to decide whe
of tlier we will remain in Peace, or go to War.
in For if it had fird been determined to call for
he farther information, how did he know that it
II- would be given, or if given, whether it would
re, not be in a mutilated date, rather than which,
ild he would chufe to act without it upon the
,as MelTage of the President alone ; and, accor
he ding to the opinion of the gentleman from
iey Delaware (Mr. Bayard) the house ought not
lay to ask for any papers whatever from the Exe
all cutivc. He thought theinformationcontained
go in the Meflage of the President was f ufficient
eft td decide the quedion at present before the
on committee of the whole, as he there dates,
le, that he has 110 ground to hope for a happy
in- issue to our million. This is not matter ot
in- opinion ; but coming from the President to
p. the I.egiflature, is matter of faft, and when he
:e. so fay\ it must be understood that he is not
lid willing that any farther Negociatio'n (hall take
n- place ; and that all the reasonable concessions
it having been made that can be made, there is
fed an end of the Negociation. It was true, when
> a these conceflions were made known, it was
he poflible, that he might differ in opinion from
ere the PrefidenAs to their reafonaolenefs ; but
ifi- this House has 110 controul over the Prefi
to dent in this respect. Therefore, the informa
hat tion which he has given to the house, is futti
the cient for them to act upon ;%nd they ought
ion now to fay whether they will go to War,
,ne or remain in Peace.
tirs The gentleman from ConneÂ£ticut(Mr. Da
ice na) lias supposed that the resolution before
!g S the committee of the whole, is vague and
ar, inexplicit ; merely a thing for declamation
as and speeches, and that it ought therefore to
the be disposed of as soon as poflible. He was
at himfelf also in favpgr of getting through with
'ed it as soon as poflible ; but it was extraordina
for ry, that that gentleman should complain of
:ha its being vague, and ytt endeavour to make 1
it more To, by wilhingto feÂ« i' nded
propofcd. As to thefpcecbes lad been
made upon this cccalion, they writ* not pro
perly produced by the motion befoÂ»e (he com
mittee, and could not be charged tipon the
fupportersofit. Theonly arguments offered
in favour of it (which had been in some degree
retrained by the amendment) whet.: to (hew,
that it is not expedient to go war ut tlv.s time.
Mr. G. did not fee how the information
proposed to be called for could influence the
vote on the queltidn before the committee.
If any gentleman could shew this, he would
not object to the postponement. The mover
acknowledged hedid not want the informati
on forhimlelf; it was only to remove|any
clamour wfcirh might be tiled in debate, or
which might appear in the papers.
It was true, Mr. G. said, however obnox
ious the fa6t might be to some gentlemen,
that the me(TagÂ£.of the Preiident had produ
ced the effect which had been mentioned ; it
had upon his mind the effect of a Declaration
of War. He did not fay that it really was so ;
but the eff'eiit produced upon him was, a be
lief that if famething was not done by thele
giflature to prevent it, the consequence would
be war. 1 his conviction he felt from the
moment the melTage was read. He under- ,
(food the fame effect was.produced on others.
And though he was not certain about the faÂ£t
of the fall which had been faid'to h-ve taken
plat-e in the price of produce, yet, if it were
10, it was not produced by the decree of the
DiretVoryj as that accewnpanied the firft mes
sage of the President, and it was the la(t which
had had the effect spoKen of.
The effefct produced by the decree of the
Direitory, said Mr. G. we know. It can be
afcertainad by tlje variation it has produced
in the price of insurance. He understood the
difference which had been made by thff de
cree in the insurance of velfels from London to*
this country, was five per cent.
Mr. G.'thought it important that an earl
decision should be given to the question be
fore the committee, that the people of tl e
United States might-know what: they had to
expeÂ£t, and in order to remove- the idea
which every where prevails, that we (hall be
iri w<fr in a (hort time. It is upon this idea,
said he, that the Insurance Offices rcfufe to
insure velfels in French ports not on account
of.the decree of the Directory, but Irom tie
melfage of the President : and it was with a
view of removing this impreflion, he beteved,
that the resolution was laid upon the table.

that the Greeks established at Vienna, have
an understanding with several rich Greek

" The French revolution has extended
its effects from Lisbon to this place. The
Grand Sultan has the mortification to fee
the old system overturned here as well as in
several other countries. France will soon
cover Europe with its* numerous and vali
ant legions. Instead of being a friend at a

bor. The capture of the former Venetain

pies all the atteHtion of the Divan, at the

" The Turkish troops will not be able

The beginningof this month an ambafladorwas

to make representations to the French go
vernment, and to enter into negociations*
AstherehaTebeen great infurre&ions in some
of the islandÂ» of the Levant, the French
general Serrurier, commanding at Venice,
was obliged to dispatch great reinforcements
to thefeiflands, which has ferÂ»ed to increase
the Porte's anxiety. Since which the Porte
seems determined to take strong measures
to meet these exigencies. Conferences have
been held with the Ruffian minister, and
it is yet possible, that before the end of this
century, Russia will be the ally of Turkey
in a common cause, especially if PrulTia (hall
be forced to declare itfelf, and that the
French should extend yet farther the mise
ries of war. It is pofliUle, that in such a

Extra& of a letter from a refpeftable house in

" The government of Hamburg, we under

termined to resist the one that had for its objeft
the confilcation of Britilh p-cperty, and the

ExtraS of a letter from Baltimore.
" The Union from Harwich failed about

COMMVMCATION.
When a vile declaimer in excuse of foreign
robbery and insult, who is himfelf a NOTED
gamblsr, attempts to gull his hearers by ap
pealing to the purity of his motives and his mo
ney tranfaflions, he is likely to obtain equal cre
dence with a bawdy who should makeprotefta
tidns of cbaftity, or a Bully, tuho experts to
ejlablijb a character of bravery by calling names
from an inaccessible situation.
However eonfonant such attempts may be to
the views and decorum of our Frenchified pat.
rots, the independent citizens of the United
States are not to be thus be-oiled.
A Paris paper of January 27, contains the !
fallowing particulars of a
REVOLUTION in HOLLAND. j
The patriotic party have been for some
time Strengthening themselves. The mod ,
influencial of them, determined to sign ;
what they called the " Constitutional Sym- '
b'ol," an aft containing the general princi- :
pies which, in the sense of the patriots of
Batavia, ought to be the basis of the confti- ;
tution, as well as of the provisional gov- !
ernment. The number of sign era soon be
came confidcrable, and among them many
of the names of the representatives.
At length, on the 2 (ft January, every
thing being prepared, and the moll secure
measures taken to preserve the public tran
quility, orders were given at 4 a. m. to ar
rest fix members of the ccmmiffion of fo
reign affairs, and at the fame time the reft
of the representatives were invited to attend
in the hall of the national convention.
At five o'clock the members who had
signed the symbol, had assembled with the
President at the residence called Harlem ;
many others soon attended ; at seven o'clock
a majority present, a and detachment of the
national guards, and other troops in pay
had collected in ceremony before thisafil-m
---bly of conventional members, and condufted
them into the national hall, amidfb popular
acclamation*.
The afiembly was immediately formed
and the President, after having proclaimed
the motives of this extraordinary convoca
tion, ordered, with cor.sent of a great ma
jority, thearreftof2i members, exclusive
of thfjeommittee already arretted; two of
the 21 not being found, the remaining 19
were instantly conveyed and lodged in a
neighbouring hall, and by a solemn decree
the 21, together with the fix of the diplo
matic commifiion, were excluded from a
feat in that body.
The afiembly purified by that exclusion,
decreed successively the fundamental articles
of the cbnftitution, those which establish a
provisional government and which assure,
wfth the public tranquility,the plenitude of
the Conventional power.
The afiembly declared itfelf permanent
â¢ and pursued peaceably the course of their
operations. Cbmmiflionera were soon feat
into all the provinces, and every thing an
> nounces thai calm will there be preserved
