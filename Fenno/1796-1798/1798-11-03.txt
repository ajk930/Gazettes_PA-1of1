WELL known and patented inKagland,France, th
Poland, and all the capital cities in Europe, tv
where the most astonishing cure* have been effect- r;
ed on judge'd iHccrable by all phyficiant.
In a Treatise printed ih London, on the properties an
of this powder, by T. Seymour, M. D. late Cha- fit
mid to his Majeftr, there arc stated two hundred pi
cases, where this mod valuable remedy has proved
infallible, in all kind of fevers, pleurisy, Moody flux,
invcrdte tbeutnatiftrtj, fciatUa, apoplexy, paialyjte, yel~
low jaundice, ritigrvorm, wormt Â» children and in grov/n
perfsns, wbitet, chronical bead and Jlomach aches, bepa
tick and nephretical or flone cholic, the lings evil, scurvy
and the mojl inveterate and complicated venereal difea/i. ftt t
is likewise the befl prepajative for the fntall pox
and measles ; ol the greatefl utility for young as sJ
well as for elder ladies at the critical epoch qf their m
life. The efficacy of this powder in leveral of the th
above diseases has been dilcovered by chance, and rn
so it has been in the yellow fever lift year, by Mr.
Mahy, who cured several by adminillering only w
two of the said powders, and loft riot a single pa- r<
tient which he undertook to cure, as proved and p
attelled by the here annexed certificates, whose ori-
ginalmay be fccil at Andrew HadfeÂ£s umbrella fiop, vt
A'. IJf, corner of Cbefnut and FourthJiretts, the on- ai
ly place where these powders are to bÂ« had, witji
proper dire<3 ions for the use of them.âPrice Jwo
dollars.
The ufefulnefs and certainty of this remedy be
ing so great for so many dangerous disorders, any
! person wilhing to be provided with those powders,
will pleafa to apply very soon, at thÂ± qj iatitj at
Is, hand is rot very large, and it is doubtful if for a
it- long time, or if ever any other genuine will be im
be . ported, the secret remaining only in the hands of
le- the inventor, in Europe, and never being commu
cd nicated to, or difccvered by any othar person.
