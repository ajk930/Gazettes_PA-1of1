I"he following Charafler of this wiui
is extratfted from the Monthly Review, f 3ti, 31a, for
March, 1793,
" We have no small degree of pleasure in announcing
the present work to our readers ; as one wh ch from the
freedom of its enquiry, the grandeur of its vie ws, and the
fortitude of its principl-s, is eminently deserving of atten
tion. By this cutoghmi, we would by no means be und"-
stood to fubferibe to all the principles which thr
contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived â <nar degree of
certainty which is requisite, for a--' IWO 10 think a
iike on all fubjedls ; neither jiftaiiguage attained that con
sistent accuracy, which them to convey their
thoughts, even when > Ae y think alike, in a manner
fe&ly corxedt and intelligible to both. Th*Â£Â» ditficultie*
arÂ«-ofily to be overcome by a patient, fnceffant, and bene
volent investigation. 1? â ' '
" Many of the opinionc which this work contains, are
bold ; fojne of them are novel; and feme doubtless are ej
roneoas: âbut that which ought to endear it even to those
whose principles it may offend, is the strength of argu
ment adduced in it to prove, that peace and order most efÂ«
fedlitally promote the happiness after which political re
formers are panting âthat as the progress of knowledge
is gradual, political reform ought net to be precipitate;â
violence is dangerous not only to indi
viduals (for that result comparatively would be of small
account) but to the general cause of truth. It is the op
pofiteof this principle that inspires the er.emiesof politic
al enquiry with so much terror ; it is the supposition that
change must inevitably be attended by the turbulence arid
injustice of commotion; and that innovation cannot be
made without the intervention of evils more deftruftive
than those which are intended to be refornud. Under the
conviiftion of this philanthropic fentimctt, of calm and
gradual reform, (which in its proper plact he has fully il
iuilratedj Mr. Godwin proceeds without 'cruple firft to en
quire into present evil, through its essential branches, and
next to demonstrate future good.
" Dividing his Work into eight books and making the
importance of political institutions the fubjefl of
the firft, he begins by an attempt to prove thf omnipo
tence of government over the moral hahits of mankind ;
and that on these moral habits their wisdom, virtue and
I felicity depend."

We ate assured, and every benevolent mind mud
exult at the recital of the faÂ£i, that the fubfeription
c in New-York for the relief of our fuffering breth
ren in Chnrlellon, very soon amounted to Thirty
II Thousand Dollars; only a part of the molt
wealthy of thÂ» citizens had been applied toâthe
fubfeription was going on, and it was expc&ed to
c double that sum before it was finifhed. What a
f noble ! What a spirit of emulation mud
4 it excite in other cities ! This is the way to
lighten the burthen of heavy misfortune, to raise
the desponding heart, and once mote to "open the
windows of hope to the mind, which the sweeping
element had stripped of the produce of the indus
try of years. There is a most glorious fpir.it of
s philanthropy and benevolence which pervades this
r continent âOn ths- prcfeot occasion it will un
-1 doubtedly manifeft itfelf with distinguished luflre.
_ Every avenue thro' which this benevolence can be
| cOndu&ed (hould be opened. Jtet us remember
, that thelofsof the citizens of Charleston is at le-ft
half a million sterlinc ; large contributions
will be neceflary to realize to all the fufferers re
-1 Ipeftively a small proportion of this sum.
; Every religious and corporate society will of
course turn their earliest attention to the business,
and the good work will be recommenced by the
governors, magistrates and ministers of th?t gospel

to put it by.

cinnati, the officers of the state government, and
the militia, met in the state-house, and from thence
proceeded to the house ofthe governor,to congrat

partook of an elegant cold collation in the govern

I Cr DERBY ASSIZES.
I U What mod particularly engaged the attention of
J the public was, a charge againtl a woman of the
_j rtame of Ann Hoon, aged 25, for the wilful mur
-1 der of her infant child, about fourteen months old;
J the circumQances of this murder were as follow :
on Friday last this poor creature, who ia the wife
of a labouring man, was about to heat her oven,
and being (hort of wood, had broken down a rail
( or two from the fencing round the plantation of a
- gentleman in the neighbourhood ; some of her
t neighbors threatened her with a prosecution, and
told her (he would be transported for it.
1 his so much alarmed her mind, and the idea of
. being separated from her child, whom (he had al
ways appeared remarkably foad of, so wrought on
her imagination, that (he formed the horrible deiign
of putting her to death, in order that, by surrend
ering herfeif into the hands of justice, (he might
be executed for the murder, and so be forever re
: united in Heaven to that babe whom (he hadioved
more than life. As soon, therefore, as her hus
band was gone out to his labor, (he proceeded to
put this diabolical design into execution : (he filled
a large tub with water, and taking the child in her
arms, was about to plunge it into the yvater, when
. the babe, smiling in its mother's face, difavhned her
for the moment, and fee found herfclf unable to
commit the honid fad. She then lulled the babe
( to ileep at the brcr.lt, and wrapping a cloth round
it, plunged it into ike tub, and held it tÂ»der water
till hfe became extinct , ,hÂ« B took it%,t of the
I tu >i and laid it on the bed, and taking tier hat and
cloak, locked her street-door, and left her key at a
( neighbor's for her lmlhand when he (hould return
from his labor : die then proceeded to walk eight
ornuie miles to a -qiagiftratc, and, requesting ad
. m :7 on to hlm > to 'd Km the whole story, concluding
with an earned desire immediately to be executed.
She was tried this morning, and many drong in.
