tea- 1 will rent my merchant Mil! at the little Falls of Po wo ;
towmac, for any term not less than seven, nor mort than - â  {
eleven years, from the firft day of September next. The _ d
miil-houfe is 41 by 40 feet, three stories high, built with the
Â§ stone, and has in, it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two }
overil.ot 18 feet water-wheels, and Evans's machinery'
complete, with every other thing proper and necessary for
â¢ft, carrying on the bulinefs with dispatch, and at as little ex
ally] penfe as poflible, all 111 good order.âFrom the mill to my
'' landing.on the Potomac river, (whttecrah, of any bur- u (
then may deliver grain and take in fU ar)' it is about 40 ."7,
yards, and. from thence by water M George-Town and
the City of Walhington, about 3 miles, and to Alexan- jto.
Me dria about 11 rhiles. This situation, aided by a fufficient last
' capital, will command the produce of a very extensive
back country, where Urge quantities of wheat and other
grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8 I
to 10 miles less than to any reaiket town upon the navi- _
gation of the Potowmac. There are on the premises a P)
large stone Coopers' lhap, a (lone granary, and a commo
dious miller's house. At the landing at'orel'aid a bridge
'is now building'over the Potomac, which is in great lor
wardnefs and probably will be finifhed the enffting fail. â
5 There are alio on the premises, a Brewery and Diltille
pafs_, r y ) built with stone, in them are three stills, two coppers
Wi* with every necessary article, aH new, and in
2w ' goo3-eÂ®dsr, and fufii'ciently large to carry ou the Brew-
try and Distillery upon a very extensive plan. This prop- Qn
erty I will rent for the fame term of years, .
Upon my lauds adjoining the premises, and along the h _
banks of the river, where craft may lead witheafe and dil-
patch, is an i.umenfe q-iantity of building and lounda-
1400 tion -llones. Four quarries are now open, and as many
frame, m ore may be opened with ease: the stone taken from _
ichors quarries is better, and has the prescience at tÃis market, . j
Tho- to any other stone brought td it. 1 will rent thei'e quarries
separately or together as may best suit.
, next On the top of the hill, and about 200 yards from the
eo 4 mill, is a flone Dwclling-houfe, large enough for the ac
ââ â ââ  commodation of a family : also, akitchen, dairy, fmokc

ILLUSTRATED.
Embellilhed with a beautiful head of
S. VERGES, C. S.
THE publisher thinks it a mark of refpeA, due to a
liberal and enlightened public, to inform them that
this is the Poem for the publilhing of which he has been
twice dragged from hiÂ« house, and is now laboring under
a vexatious profec'ution He iÂ« conscious that the piece
contains nothing either criminal or offenfive, unless ori
ginal wit. deroi ated in elsgant language, ba criminal or
dlfgutling to the prevalent talle; and, as.he trusts that
neither of these i-, the cafe, he submits the work to the
â¢public with a,full a durance of its meeting with a favora
ble reception.
He would beg his prosecutors to call to mind (if they '
have ever read it) the following apologue to a w#llknown
ropianceâ" A young painter, indulging a vein of plea
santry, Iketched a kind of Convtrfation Piece, refpeAinga
bear, an owl, a monkey, and an ass; and to render it
more striking, humourous and moral, diltinguifljed eve
ry figure by some emblem of human life. Bruin was
exhibited.in the garb and attitude of an old, tOothless,
drunken soldier; the owl perched upon the handle of a
toffee-pot, with fpefiades on his nose, seemed to contem
plate a newfpapir; and tho ass ornamented with a huge
tyt-wig (which, however, coifld not conceal his loi.g I
ears) fat for his pidlure to the monkey, who appeared r
with the implements of painting. This wiimfi.algroup \f>
afforded some mirth, and met with general approbation, j '
some mischievous wag hinted the whole was a lam- I t
poon upon an old officer, a phyfieian, and a n.cmber of I t
Parliament; an infmuation which was no ieoner circuUt- } r
ed, than these people began to be . larnv d, and even to I i
fancy tin mfe Ives figrified by the several Pgures in the I
piece. The furious group fell upon the paii ter, who dc-l '
dared that be had no deiign to give offence, or to tha- lj
Ta&erizÂ«s par cular pcifon-. '1 hey affirmed, tie rrfcmbtaneej t
â was too palpable to ic ovcr/vtieJ, â and their clamours btinj [
overheard by the public, the Captain was a bear, th
Dodrr afl Mis, and the Stnator an owl, to their dyin; |
day."ââlf a limilar fÂ«ire Ihould attend che persons wb \ s
â¦will insist upon being the members of this group, th : c
public will do the publisher the jufticc to remember tha a
it it no fault of his. â¢ T

; the anival in Paris of an Austrian secretary of Je.
gation to Switzerland. We are allured he came
to propose an armistice ; but the conditions could
not be agreed on. This Secretary is returned â
It is believed that there is not now any open nego

Adtt, Miniller plenipotentiai'y of the Republic
to the Upited States of America, had demanded a
fucccffor. The direftoiy long fought for ooe.
That embassy had been offered to several citizens,
who had refufed it, and particularly to Marey. Cir*
ctimftances have changed in America," and at the
anii-Englifn party having recovered their influence,
has expressed a desire to retain his fituationj

ARMY OF THE SAMBRE AND MEUSE.
Jourdan, Commander in Chief of the Army <>f
the Sambre and Meufe, to the Â£*ecutive Direc
tory.
Head quarter# at Coblentz, June 20.
" Citizen Directors,
" I HAVE the honor to inform you, that that
part of the army which was td retreat by Nieu
wied, pafied the river the day-before yeflerday in :
the greatest order, and without losing a fingleman,
though in presence of fix regiments o< the enemy's '
cavalry, and of several battalionsxjf infantry, sup- 1
ported by twelve pieces of cannon. The enemy 1
endeavored to deflrtfy the bridge by two rafts which
they launched at it; the firft, without breaking it 1
entirely, Co far-deranged it, that it required several 1
hours to re-ettabiifh it; but this was leon done by !
the zeal, activity and talents of citizen Tirlet, eap- 1
tain of artillery, who commanded the workmenon 1
the bridge; the second rift was flopped before it '
reached the bridge.
" While the bridge was repairing,' the army took
a polrtion on the Suynbach ; whcnce it tefumed its
march in the greatest order; the"rtrtreat was Co. 1
by the cavalry and two battalions of the 30th i
half brigade, under the command of brigadier Ar- a
naudâThefe two battalion/, and the third re e i- ft
ment of l.ght-horfe, led by Colonel GroÂ«jean, dif
tingmfhed themselves by the coolness and precision b
which they displayed in then- manoeuvres, which ii
executed under the fire of the enemy's artil- v
'Iu -j at . c!cven at nl g ht Â» th at part of 4
the bridge of Nieuwied, which extends over "the a
right branch of 4 he Rhine, was reflo.ed without
accidcpt. v
" cber ' w,l Â° was retreating on the Sieir, n
was yesterday attacked in the poll of Ukeradt a!
tw. 1" the morning. The enemy', attack was so <
sudden, that he deemed it less dangerous, to" rifle
a battle, than to continue bis jÂ«rest. He theic- d
5* fore male tl>e neccfi..! y dilpo; tioi'3, ;id inarched
against the afiailaiite; h- even beat back the heads
of the enemy's fVrft'cohrtnns, but perceiving a cot
fiderable force, particulatly in cavalry,
on his two flanks, he returned to his.firft portion,
and there maintained himfftlf.
" The a&ion ceased at three in rhe afternoon.
Â»''â¢ the General was to resume bis march in the night,
to gain the lines of Duffel'dorfF. During our re
tfeat, federal partial actions took place, the parti
culars of which 1 cannot fend you, as I have not
yet received them ; but our troops invariably dis
played both courage and skill, and not a single port
was forced, fu that our retreat was conduced with.,
thegreateft ordpr.
" I cannot, citizens Diretftor*. fufHciently praise
the courage, coolni.fu.and perfcverance of the troops,
who fought for three days, and ptirfued their
in the night j neither ftraggleis nor fugitives
to bÂ« seen ; never did rhe army appear to greater
advantage than during this retreat ; and this it tllf
time to judge of the eondudl both of officers and
privates. T
" The general officers merit the highest com- J
mendatiorrs ; by their talents, their courage, and I
the precision with which they executed roy orders, I
they confirmed the courage of the soldier, and in-1
spired him with that confidence which avtrts difa-i

our own, with all its formidable batteries.âGene
rals'Defaix, Beaupon, and Pernio, are purfifing th?
enemy with vigour. The stlion (till continues. A
great extent of territory, and a number of vil
lages, are already occupffd by our troops. The
Â«nemy is quite (lupehed by an attack as warm as it
was unexpected. From five to fix hundred prison
ers already taken, with fcveral caffoons and pieces
of cannon.
" It is not possible lo bestow fufficient commend
ation on the bravery of jhe army, on the precition,
ar.d particularly OYI the discretion with which the
business has been conduced. Yeflerday moving
30,000 men were in the environs of Sttafb 'rgh,
and nobody knew their real destination. At Neu
ftadt, it was supposed, yefterjay morning the head
quarters were going to Turkheim, when they were
dire&ing their march to Strafb lrgh. From such
unanimity every thtng is to be expe&ed.
" I have just left the Cpmmandej in Chief, as he
was parting the Rhine. He will fend off an ex
traordinary cornier to night with farther particulars
of thwglorioijs expedition.

It is believed that the Chevalier Azzara has al

d The rigorous measures lately employed, hav^ s

" N. B. The French. 'Journals of Paris, # who
are disfigured every day by publilhing the ridiculous
relations of the French Journals of Frankfdrt,
which are at the devotion of the Efnigrants,, have
announced as inconceivable defeat of the army of
Italy, in an attempt to pass the Addige. What is
mod remarkable in this news, is its absolute falfe
hood. On the 3d -of June General Buonaparte
announced from Verona, that he was pofffcffed of
all the bridges of the Addige ; his advanced guards
were ten leagues from theftee.' No battle had ta
ken pface on the 20th. The republican army ha<l
advanced almost without a blow far on the other
fide of that river. " Thuan."

/ We yesterday received by express ParÂ« journals,
/to the 30th ult. inclusive. By these we leatn that
J "the FreHeh unexpectedly croffedthe Rhine at Straf
/ burgh on ths 23d ult. with a very considerable
I force, and taking the Auftrians by surprise made
themselves matters of the Itrong fort'of Kehl, and
j after making from 6 to 700 prisoners, extended
; their deftruitive into the neighbouring
\ eountty.
'l'he Hambutgh mail due yesterday arrived in
tdwn this morning and brought an aecount of fotne
farther advantages gained by the victorious Auitri
ans over the flying French.
Different Recounts from Frankfort of the jft
mention a second action to have been fought at
Okeroth on the 20th, in which the French were
defeated with the'lofs of 1800 men left dead on
the field, 700 prisoners and several pieces of cannon.
These accounts farther state, that the column of
French retiring from Neuwied is cut off, and must
either surrender or be drowrfed in the Rhine. But
it appears from General Jourdan's letter to the Di
feftory, that they have cffefted their passage over
that river.
The French are retreating with precipitation to
Duffcldorf, and the Auftrians are purfufng them
tt-ithei wit h equal The former are said
tc have loft no kfs than 40 pietcs of artillery in
their retreat.
â  The extraordinary Gazette, published last night,
confirms the account in yesterday's Courier of the
actions that took place on the 15th and 16th, on
the right fide of the Rhine, between part of Ge
neral Jourdan's army and the Archduke Charles.
After the battle on the 16th, General Kleber reti
red firft to Ahenkirchen, and afterwards took.pos
session of the heights of Kirpen near Ahenkirchen.
111 that position he was attacked, on the 19th, by
the Austrian General Kray. After a very obfti
natf aÂ£HoÂ», the Auftrians (the Gazette Extraordi
nary states) drove the French from the heights, but
did not venture to pursue them.
The loss of the Auftrians is stated at between $
and 600 men. The loss of the French at above
JCo taken.prisoners and several hundred killed, be
sides, " according to all report*,'' a great number
wounded. ,
On the night of the 19th, General Kleber cros
sed the Sieg, and dire&ed his march towards Duf

'Â» The attack of yesterday lasted untils o'clock in
e the evening. It appears to have been very serious ;
the cacncm and the mufquetry, the sabre and the
bayonet were all employed, and the cavalry were
'' waimly engaged. The French took, loft, and re
*' took a redoubt upon the Rheeback ; they must
0 haveloft many men, for the soldiers were obliged
to pass the water with their guns over their heads,
1 and under the fire of the Auftrians. The attack
extended to the whole Hoe from Rhein, Gerheim,
and Lipffein, opposite Oggerftleim. The French
inthe morning dislodged the Auftrians from Franc
, kenthai, but in the afternoon the poll was retaken'
'][ from them.
1- This morning every thing is quiet ; the Auftri
ans have concentred their position behind Mandach
to the old redoubt df the Rhine. The French have
it in contemplation to employ the Imperialists in
fuchca manner here as to prevent their detaching
troops to the Lahn.
