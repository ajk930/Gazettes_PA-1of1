'Z TO THE PÂ£)PLE OF VIRGINIA. d '
t. ' - th
;5i Fellow Ciiztns, de
! IN lpm< ptt&i of our country, difiatisfac- "
rix. tiocs hare Eiten ettattd in tlw: rninds of ma
ny, with the conduct of Congress at their (j
, last fcflion in the palling two laws known
bty the namesjÂ«f the Alien Law and Sedi
tion Law. I{ is ever desirable that things m '
fliould be fein io their true light, and efpe- an
thofe ftÂ»utfs whose constitutionality P a
:Â»s feri&ufly* drawn in question, by men whose r^]
opinions are refpe&ed in society. T have
lately seen a remonstrance against these laws
proposed to the people of Albermarle for
their fignatnres, and to the Senate
and House of Representatives, which has
every appearance of study and deliberation.
if_ It isfuppofed to have proceeded from the
pen of -
rea and it contains such a rtprefentation of the
los objeftions to these laws as might alarm and
nd- midead some of the bed intentioned and
' ea > bed affeifted men among us towards the Ge- pa
neral Government. Tiie objeftions ought of
>(ed not t0 P a^s ""noticed, and I have waited in it,
the hope that some writer more competent tr
ew- to the talk would have undertaken their je<
'â¢ refutation. It is for this purpose alone, re
' and not to awaken party spirit or political so
zeal, that I (hall trouble the public with fu
y some observations on the Albermarle remon- te
ftrance.
Against the Alien Law it is fiogly ob so
dor je&etl that the power of fending alien frier.ds fe
re * out of our territory was never vested in the re
""ed fJ overnment ie United States. To er
maintain the objection the remonstrance par- w
x ticularly recites tie powers given to Con tl
gfffs, as enumeraiefi in the eighth fediion in
of the firft article, andaflerts that the lawis vv
~ warranted by none of tiiem, and if warrant- a
ed by none of them, concludes that it is un- p
constitutional. li
It is remarkable that the writer of this
for elaborate performance, who certainly be- t<
?he : stowed much confideratioo on the fÂ«bjeft, tl
! never, in his researches in the Constitution, it
article ; and this is the more unaccountable, li
when we are allured that" in all its parts it t'
ler had been examined." t
' The fourth feftion of the fourth article f
has ordained that " the United States (hall a
" guarantee to every state in the Union, a r
| " republican form of government, and Jball t
" prote3 each of themasraiiUl invasion : and. on i
" tiinlijt (T. iflfn * e( T'" ature or Â°' the fX - C
41 convened) against domestic violence."â
â¢ Here the dflty of " pretelling eachJlatefrom t
wr. i< invasion," it exprefnly imposed on the t
â¢' States. To discharge this duty, the *
United States are bound, not only to repel \
> j invaders after t"hey {hall have entered our b
j territory, bat t6 prevent, if poflible, an ac- c
j tual invafiofl. The means necessary and pro- t
: per to protest from invasion, whether ,by r
repelling or preventing it, are to be decided <i
by COngrtfs. The lalt clause of the Bth g
fe&ion of the firft article has given them the e
power " to make all laws which (hall be c
" necessary and proper for carrying into ex- i
Its " ecution the foregoing powers, and all Â£
" other powers vested by this constitution c
"in the government of the United States, c
4 ' or m any department or officer thereof." n
phia, I n palling this law, then, Congress passed a i
law that was necessary and proper for car- )
:lock rying into execution the power veiled in the i
00,s > United States to protest each of the states a
from fardgn invasion. a
land It was passed on the 25th day of June f
Bra- last, when the mod serious apprehensions 1
rash- were entertained that France, whose decrees j
f o n r _ and conduft were, and yet are, hostile to 1
p u . the United States, would fend an army and c
land invade some part of our country, where it 1
afies was weakest ; perhaps some of the southern I
; &c - or western states. Under this impreflion t
ired we find a considerable addition has been J
111 made to the army of the United States, and t
the President was authorized still further \
to augment it in the event of a declaration (
of war, or aftual invasion, or of imminent f
danger of such invasion, by calling into fer- t
nent â¢ , c ' Â°,.
vice a number ot troops not exceeding ten 1
ant j thousand men. At this time there were a '
great number of alien Frenchmen difperfedin (
various parts ef the United States, capable t
:r ar- of bearing arms ; and some of them were 1
rs. justly fufpefted to be emissaries and spies t
an for the Dire ft or yof France, employed to \
on a fend intelligence of what was palling in our t
iedi- country. The number of these alien French
oind men exceeded, at the lowest tftimate, 20 s
thousand men, ready to join the French i
llandard, whenever it should be erefted on j
so our land. i
18-i Would it have been prudent or fafe, un- (
der thele circumstances, to have been with- 1
â  37i out a law that authorised the removal of 1
jj?, aliens dangerous to the peace and fafety of j
the United' Statesi Ought congress, who
und. are " to protest each state from inva- j
fion," to have taken no measures for author- <
izing the removal of the aliens, whose pre- <
fence held out the strongest inducement to t
veen France to attempt an invasion ? In the situ- I
ation of America will it be said that this ;
law was not a proper one to prevent an inva- 1
Jthe fion ? Was not the piobability of invasion
' 39. lessened by-depriving France of the aflift
sup- ancc wbiqh '"'g' ll havc been -attained aud
litici woutd be expeiSed from alien Frenchmen in
the bosom of our country J It was then
â¢ 6t with the view to protest us from invafiââ
that the law was passed, and wifely pasf c( J
d for empowered the President to â¢Â« orJe'-

J "or lhall have reasonable ground# to f u^
L " pcft are con cerned in any treasonable or
" fecrtt machinations against the govern
" ir.ent thereof to depart out of the terri
" tory of the United States." This my
fellow citizens is the law which is confident
ly pronounced in the Alberraarle remon
tlrance to be unauthorised by our conftitu.
tion, and which from " a solicitude for the
constitution" you are called upon to declare
a violation of that sacred instrument. This
is the law which you arc. dcfired "to cen

the law of which you are called upon to

1 " an authority competent -tÂ» the 'â¢"-â â tiau

to THE PEOPLE
[ Fellow Citizenr,
1 I HAVE fnbmitted to your view those
- parts of tlie constitution of the government
t of the United States in the very words of
i it, and my interpretation of them, which I
C trull will shield the Alien Law from the ob.
r jeflion of unconftitutioÃality. I {hall not
, resort to any other parts of that instrument
1 for fuccoflr, but will offer l /orae further con.
i fiderations to support and maintain that iu
- terpretation.
The States of America form a complete
fovereigrr nation,, in their unitedLcÂ«t..sicir ,
s several capacity ; moTl especially in "their
e relations with foreign powere and so eign
-3 ers. There caa be no complete sovereignty
- without the power of removing aliens; and
the exercise of such a power is inseparably
n incident to t :, e nation The faluspopull,*
.8 which is the supreme law requires it. It is
a power necessary for the protection of the
i. people in their properties, liberties and
lives. If the terms ef the constitution were
is less explicit than we find them in granting
to Congress the power " to protest each of
t, the dates from invasion," on this principle
l, !t might reasonably be contended that the
h power was veiled in Cangrefs to remove a
:, lieas. Upon the present occasion, I recur
it to this principle only to corroborate the in
terpretation which has been given of the
le fourth feftion of the fourth article, that if
U any doubts may remained as to its cor
a re&nefs they may be dispelled. It proves
ill that the interpretation of the express word!
ijp is confouant to the rea/ba, Jpirit, and intent
K- of the constitution, and therefore mutt he
â â Should mw fcdimââg l r
m tions be fufficient to prove, farisfaftorilv" '
le that the government of the United States
le were authorised to pass the alien law, they
<el wtll obtain the *nd for wheh they have
ir been written. But let them not be mifun
c- derflood ; they are not to be twderftood
>. to establish the do<3rine that each state may
y not expel or remove such aliei<s a3 it may
â¢d deem necessary for its particular fafety. The
h government of the United States may ex
le ercifc the power of removing aliens, danger.
Ie ous to the general fafety ; and each state
c- may exercise a like power over aliens dan
ill gerous to itfelf, These powers are not in
in compatible in practice. This, I hope, will
i, not be controverted, when we attend to the
" a&aal state of things in Virginia. A law
a is now in force, in our state, passed in the
r- year 1792, which enafts, " that it lhall and
ie may be lawful for the governor, with tbe
:s advice of the council of Itate, to apprehend
and fccure, or cause to be apprehended and
ie secured, or compelled to depart this common
is wealth, all suspicious persons, biiirig the fub
es jests of any foreign power or state, who (hall
to have made a declaration of war, or adlually
id commenced hostilities against the the laid
it states, or from whom the Prejident of the Uni
rn ted States Jhall apprehend hojlile designs againjl
>n the said Jlates, provided information thereof
:n Jhall lave been previoujly received by the execu
id tive from him, and ia all such cases the go.
er veraor, with the advice of the council or
>n state, shall, and he is hereby empowered to
nt fend for the person and papers of any foreign
r- er within this state, in order to obtain such
:n information as he shall judge necessary."
a " All Iheriffs and gaolers shall receive such
in suspicious persons, whom by warrant from
ile the govertor, they (hall be commanded to
re receive, and them ia their prifoss or custody
es to detain or transport out of the common
to wealth, as by such warrant may be com
ur manded."
h- Between the alien law of thÂ« United States
to and this law of the state of Virginia, there
:h is no collision. Their aim and policv is, in
>n principle, the fame ; and the latter is no
more a violation of the constitution of the
n- state, than tire former violation of the con
h- ftitution of the United States. Each is a
of like conftitotional ; and of the two the Vir
of ginia law is the moil arbitrary,
bo Here we behold an example set by Vir
ra- ginia for the removal of suspicious aliens out
>r- of its territory, and the United States have
â¢e- done no more than authorised by their law,
to the removal of fufpe&ed aliens out of the
u- territory of the United States. Here we find
nts a legillative proviGon made by our own
<a- ila'e for compelling to depart the commoti
on "'ealth all suspicious perfor.s, ftibje&s of a
.ft foreign power, from whom the president of
ud the United States, ft ill apprehend hostile
in tiefigns against. the said dates, provided in
icn formation thereof stall have been previously
on received by the executive from hint. This
â¢J law of the state ia in aid of the proteftion
3 er which the United States are bound to afford
t0 to each state, against invasion or domestic in
t(,s farreftion ; and therefore it ii cot__deroga
uf. * oiteiy ot ihe people.Tory of or ipconilAcnt with, the ve
iled in the gea- ral government. - As th:
United Stages and rÂ«,;ii state may call out
the militia of (We to fupprtfj an inftir.-e.*}-
ion each state refprclively, >*Â° 'he United
States and each state may exercise the power
of removing aliens out ot each state refped
ively. I" these cases there may be a con
currence of power for the fame end the fafe
ty of the people. ...
Nor from these obfervitions is it to be
inferred, that if congress have a power to
remove aliens out of tiie United States in a
summary way, they have the like pp er to
r-".ioye citizens. A ci.izen is a P art y to
the social compaft, which has conferred on
him certain rights of which he may not be
arbitrarily depriv.d, but an alien is not a
member of the f ciety ; -among these a
citizen has a right to remain in the territo
ry of the United States, un e s he commits
an olfence for which that right is t rfeite |
by law ; and if charged with such offence, i
he would be entitled to a speedy trial by an
impartial jury, as in other cases. The ci
tizens conlequentl/ have no caufc of ifqui
etude in confequ-nce either of the law ot
congress or of the law f Virginia, author
ising the removal of alien:
Having made ihele explanations, I shall \
detain you no longer on the conftitutionali '
ty of the allien law, which f hope has been
Ihewn to your entire lati'faction. That it
has produced very beneficial effects in
ftrengiheniiig our coun'ry at thi perilous
time, will scarcely be doubt'd.âln coi fe
qnence of it a grcitt many alien Frerchmen,
and among them the notorious emilla y
have left America, from a ear
tliai it be executed on them. They
wete confciotis t-â¢ at they wpuld, if in their
power, join toe standard of France when
ever it should be erefied within our territo
ry ; a*d they reasonably concluded it was
fafeft and moll convenient for thsm to go
immediately out of ourcountry before they
, WCrexrrJorni.
This, my felrvw citizens, ~is a candid
view of the alien law, which has given oc
casion to so much clamour among us, and
which some of yon, from the mifreprefenta
tiou made of it in the Albemarle remon
strance, might be induced to reprobate as a
violation of our invaluable constitution.
The appeal is made to you,â Does it afford
any jutl canfe of complaint ? On the con- !
trary is it not a new proof of the vigilance 1
and wifdoin of Congress anxious to protect
our favoured country from foreign inva
fien ?

ADDRESS
Of the Lord Mayor of Loudon,
to thi Livery.
Sir Richard Carr Glyn, being invested in the
Insignia of Office, came forward upon the Hun
tings and addressed the Livery to the following
' effeit :
" Gentlemen of the Livery,
You have done me the honor to place me
in the high and dignified fitnation of Lord May
the most important which" ~tTiVl:itizenÂ«%P
d<?n can beftow â-a situation ot the highett trust
and greatest confequente. For this mark of
your confidence and esteem, I have to return tÂ»
yon my grateful thanks. When I firt deter
mined to accept a magifteriil office in this city,
I had no obje<S of ambition in my view, and my
only motive was, a sense of duty to my coun
try, and a deSre to join in tfcs conduct or' a good
government ; with this feeling, I have given up
a great part of'my time and attentionto the pub
lic duties of a niagiftrate ; and I cannot help
lamenting that this obligation w*iich I feel bear
ing upon me, and which compels me to take
my (hare of public toil, is not more properly
felt, than .it is by merchants and other principal
gentlemen in this city. I have, however, con
tented to take an aftive part in public affairs ; iu
doing so, 1 am aware I must, for the next year
renounce all inclination to priÂ»ate indulgences,
â  in order to dedicate my time and attention to
the public service of my fello>v citizer.a j and
tbis I lhall readily do in the present anxious state
ef public affairsâa (late which demands, of
every man, every exertion he is able to make,
and sf which the public Hand in need. It (hall
be the firft object of my attention to watch over
and to preserve the peace and tranquility of this
city.; and then to secure the property, and pro
tea the persons of my fellow sitizens ; and (
have earnestly to reqtiaft of you, gentlemen,
and also of all other the inhabitants of this great
city, to lend your best afliftance when called for
in aid of the civil power. I have now served
the city of London, in a magisterial station, for
eight years. I hÂ»>pe I know the privileges of
this ancient city. I know that to the preserva
tion ot thete privileges, is to be imputed your
great advantages and immense power, and
and which,can con inue only while the City
Rights are unimpaired. Your pre-eminence,
and the pre-eminence of this country, will con
tinue whde the choice of your corporation, and
of the other corporations of the kingdom re
main pure an I upright. Gentlemen, I trad,
that at the head of my magisterial office, I (hall
return to you the privileges of the cty undi
minilbed, unimoaired and unaltered ; fixed ind
determined as I ani to do that which is honour
able as a man, and that which is jull as a ma
giSrate j and I trust that my errors will never
be rmputed to >h e heart, but will be regarded
among those failings that every man, more or
. ' ls ''able to. I hap; I know how to appre
ciate your good opinion. I trust that my afli
du.ty ,n your service will secure its continuance
and I flatter myfelr I (ball never lose your confi
aence and good upinion."
This fpesch was followed by great appUufe.

ExtraÃ of a letter from Cadiz, Sept, tj, 1798.
'* Although lord St. Vincents ftifl continues
off this Bay, we fee A merican veflels enter al
mofl every day, and this bypermiflion. It is
also very certain that the French are very much
at a loss what course to (leer with refpeifl ta the
Americans j there have been inflances of their
system of iniquity being modified in favor of
the American prizes, so that at this moment the
Amerisan flag is more refpedled than any other.
l,.BpjLÂ£P heaven that the people of America

v tÂ° ' he Â° f P oor tumbled Europe.â
Vet I am convinced from good authority that
the French fti|l build fame hopes on a reviving
;)arty in America, and they are very induftrioHs
in lpreading reports here to that effetf. Nay,
the very Spanilh minilter in Paris has just in
formed his government here that the direilory
had received certain information from America
â¢>fr the French having recovered thtirfu
penority, the probab liry of which 1 have for- 1
mally and pofitivtly denied. I forbear mention I
nig my owufufpicions concerning the source of !
this pretended intelligence. It is well known
thatthe infamous Login and the weak, ungrate
k-ozfeiulko.have arrived in Paris. There are
two things which I find to be contfnual oHefls
of mlihke among theEurcpeans intheir opinions
and judgment ef American affairs.âFirjl, they
never know how to appreciate the trueAmeucan i
in.ereft fothat it is almost impossible to make
th-tn underfland that America raav refill i
French without fubmittmg to Englifb influence : 1
Secondly, They are almolt incapable of forming 1
a just idea of the kind of Gratitude which
America owes France on account of her affi
ance in the late war. On these two topics 1
have always found it difficult or impossible to ar
gue my opponents into conviilion without ex
cepting many men of talent, and underftandinr
m other relpedts. But the spirt of enquiry
which is now gene ally awakened, resetting
e,riean affVirs will soon place things in their
:rue light.
At present it is supposed the hero of the erand
nitioji will begin defending the hill of capri
:.o.is fortune. He is by ,11 accounts in a very
derperate flruationat prefer.: with his army who

The tide of popular opinion is 9very
where bearing: down that graceless patvio
tifm, which seeks aggrandizement in the
propagation of principles, at once obfeene,
anarchical, and blasphemous. While the
lappy reverre this creates in the fitua
uon of such men as Baldwin and other de
pravid devotees to the enemies of tbeir
country, will be attributed by forne to fic
klenefs.pf temper, let us hope it is founded
on a fulid and rational reform in the princi
ples and opinions of the people. The fen
timentsof these men towards Fiance might
have been tolerated ten years ago, but they
are now become treasonable Every man
mull at times change his principles, or be
ieft in the vocative.
Notwith(landing all tbe pains taken by
France and her emifTaries to eradicate from

; So immense is the number ef natural
children in France, in consequence of the
depraved (late of fuciety in that country,
- that the wife and magnanimous rulers of j
s the Great Nation, find themselves obliged to
- make public provision for them, and to find
p them nurses. The number of the r e is so
t great, that their pay amounts to 338 672
livres. But being always kept in arrears,
tbe infants are continually left to perish in
: great numbers. Of 263 new-born infants,

The r-quifitiqns of the French imposed
1 upon their own deluded vassal , have per
haps exceeded those extorted from other
; countries. And thus have the citizens of
the all-conquering Republic atlially been j
compelled to submit tonhe wo feconcomi
â  tant of cor.quest. A large quant ty of cat

" taken r.y requisition" from the inhabitants
of Finifterre, and which they hive never

repeated applications, reduced great num

The following passage in Mil on, seems
, pecu'iarly applicable to the Great Nation,

In the ordinary affairs of life as in the
! sphere of science, nothing is more charafter
iftic of mental imbecillity than a pertinacious
1 adherence to a tenet, which, both by the
j illulltations of resfom'ng and the opinion us ,
the ivorlit, has been declared absurd and an
tenable. The mind that is not c pable of '
receding from error, can poflefs no confci
oufnefÃ of truth. Thus we daily perceive,
that men of a liberal c3ll of mind, who for
mcrly, from the impuilion of particular bir
cumllances, or from temporary enthuliafm,
, adored Frettchmeti and French conduct, are
universally falling of from their behved, and
becoming jrood domestic citizens ; while the
poor infatuated fouls, whole minds are not
their own, and who b.lieve from the inftinft
of prejudice, persist in their dclulion, and
thereby hourly render themselves the Jupes
of political jugglers and the derifian of the
world. '

FIRE!
Between the hours of 12 and 1 o'clock
this morning, a fire broke out in a dillillery
fi'uated in the Northern Liberties. By the
timely interference of the citizens it was
prevented from doing any material damage.
We have not learnt whether this fire o
riginated in accident or design. But in a
city infefted as ours, with gangs of United
Irijhmen, it is difficult to tell what is to
preserve us from general conflagration.

About three weeks ago, an Irish infur- '

serted a notice that he had arrived in Ame
rica, and purposed in the Unfiling week to
visit his friends in Philadelphia. It is
scarcely neceflary to fay, that this was not

All lifts mull fpecify, in refpedl to Dwelling-Houses thÂ«ir situation, dimensions or area, their
number of ftoriee, the r.ureber of their windows, the materials whereof ihev are

Lot 0.1 which rhey are built, not exceeding two acres in any cafe, which exceed one hundred dol
lars in value. By Outhouses appurtenant, is to be understood, Kitchen, Walh.houfe, Wood
houfe, Ice-house, Coach, or Carriage-house, Stable, Brew house and Bake-haufe, if for family
use, and generally ill buildiÃgs with the oeconomy of house-keeping only, and nor
for the purpose of carrying 011 any profeflional business, trade, or mechanic art, or to promote
husbandry, and consequently to bring in revenue to the occupant j unless buildings of the latter de
scription ihould be so lituated on lots that they cannot with a part of the lot, be separated from
the Dwclling-Houfe, without injuring the value j in which cafe as they are not to escape valuation,
theymuflgo with the Dwelling-House : and though the lot to be valued with the Dwelling-
Hcitfeand appurtenances must in no cafe exceed two acres, yet it need not contain more than the
ground os which the Dwelling-House and appurtenant buildings or outhouses are a<Â£lually ereift
ed, and what maybe nectffary, for the convenient occupancy of the fame.
in No. a, is to be comprized all Lands and Townlots (except lots on which Dwelling-Houses
with their appurte:ianccs above the value of one hundred dollan are erefled as aforefaid) all
Wharves, Stores, Ware-houses, Shops, Offices, Sugar-heufes, BiSilleries, Breweries and Bak
eries, if carried on as an occupation, Mills, Forges, Furnaces, or other Iron all kind of
waterworks and generally all such buildings as are used for the purpose of carrying on any profefli

&c. < .1 farms are to be estimated as belonging to this class ; alio unfinilhed buildings, though in
tended for Dwelling-Houles are to be valued in the situation they were in on the firft day of oÂ£\o
-bcr lad, and all Dwelling.Houses which with the outhouses appurtenant thereto, do not exceed
one hundred dollars in value.
111 the ,?d class there can be no difficulty, it comprehends all Slaves, a species of property, of
which, fortunately, there is not much in Pennsylvania.
A fine of net more than 500 dollars, nor left than 100 dollars wjth costs of l'uit, is by law im
