From late LONDON PJPER S.
7he foil owing is taken frmt an account
Ij an illuflrioUi Envl'yh Traveller in Ger
many and Turkey.
" I have already pafled a large part of
have seen -alj ih it is remarlcabje
in Cologue, Frankfort, Wnrtfburgh, and
Nuremberg. It is ir.'pofTlble not to obforve
the diflertilcc between the free towns, and
tiro Ce under the government ofabfolute Prin
ces, as all the little frfvereigna of Germany
are. tn twie firlt there appears an air of
commerce and"plenty. The streets are well
fcuilt, and full of people, neatly and plain
ly drefTed. The Amps are loaded with m?r
chandife and the commoffalty are clean and
cheerful. In the other, you fee a fort of
(hafcby finery, a number of dirty people of
quality tawdered out ; narrow nasty streets,
out of repair, wretchedly.\h ; n of inhabitants
and above half of the common fort afkiiig 1
alms.âl cannot help fancying one under ;
the figure of a clean Dutch citizen's wife,
and the plher like a poor town lady of pjea
fure, painted and ribboned out in her head
drtfs, with tarni(hed fitver-laced shoes, a
ragged under petticoat, a mifcrable mixture
of vice and poverty.
" The journey we made from Belgrade
to Adrianrple, cannot pofiibly be pasTed by
any out of a public charafter. The desert
woods of Servia are the common refuge of
thieves, who rob-fifty in a company, so that
we had need of all our guards to secure us ;
and the villages are so poor, that only'force
could extort from themnecefTsry provifiont.
Indeed the Janniflaries, had no mercy on
theirpoverty, killing allthepoultry'aiidrheep
they rould-firtd, without asking to â  whom
they belor.'jre 'wljllo the wretched owners
durst not pÂ«t in tneir claim,' for fear' of bÂ«"'
isg b4? Wi. ! . Lambs just fallen, geese and
kutkieÂ» big with egg, all massacred without
diftin&ion ! I fancied I heard the complaints
of Melibceus for the hope of his Hock. When
General Officers travel, it is yet worse.
These oppressors are not content with eating
all that is to be eaten belonging to the pea
sants ; after they have 1 crammed themselves
and their numerous retinue, they have the
impudence to exaft what they call teeth money
a contribution for the use of their teeth,
worn by doing them the honour âf devour
ing their meat. This in literally and exaft
ly true, however extravagant it may seem;
and such is the natural corruption of milita
ry Government, their religion not allowing
of this barbarity any more than ours does.
" The Government here is entirely in the
hands of the army. The Grand Siegnior,
with all his absolute power, is as much a
flavc as any of his ftibjefts, and trembles at
a Janiflary'i frown. Here is, indeed, a
much greater appearance of fubje&ion than
amongst uÂ»; a Miniiler of State it not spoke
to, but upon the knee; should a refledion
upon his conduft be dropt in a Coffee-houfe
( fpr they have fpieg every where), the house
vvogld be razed to the ground, and perhaps
the whole company put to the torture. No
huzzaing mobs, patriotic pamphlcts,or pub
lie debates about politics; none of our
harmlcfs calling names!âbut when a Minify
ter here displeases the people, in three hours
time he is dragged even from his master's
arms. They cut off his hands head and feet
and throw them before the palace gate, with
all the refpeifl in the world; while the Sul
tan (to whom they all profefs an unlimited
adoration) fits trembling in his apartment,
and dare neither defend nor revenge bis fa
vorite. This is the bleficd condition of the
moil absolute Monarch upon earthy who
owns no law but his will.
" I cannot help wishing, in the loyalty of
my heart, that th# parliament would fetid
hither a (hip load of your palfive and obedi
ent men, that they might fee arbitrary go
vernment in its clearest, ftrongeftlight,where
it is hard to judge, whether the Prince,
People or Ministers are mojl mifcrable. I
could make many reflections on this fubjedf;
but T know your own good sense has alrea
dy futoifhed you with better than I am ca
pable of.
" Mudh has been said concerning the in
fidelity of the Turkilh women, belonging to
families of quality. During my stay at Pe
ra, I heard of but one circumstance. A
young Venetian served in the (hop of an A
pothecary at Conftantiuople, whom a Tur
ki(h lady, attended only by her (lave, came
to consult, and was (hewn into ancthtr room
leaving the appientice and the fair CircaiTian
alone. It is said that nothing then pafled
between them. In a few days returning
with!: mistress, and the fame opportunity
recurring, (he opened her heart, proposed
elopement, and promised much treasure.
She kept her word, and they disappeared
without subsequent detedtiiin. Upon disco
very , the punifliment of theft: lovers would
have been horrible: he would have been im
paled alive!l!âand (he drowned in a sack!!!
" Infidelity or licentions women, is a fub
jeS of the fevertft crimination amongst the
Turks, and their punifliment of it is nothin-*-
less than gross barbarity. That branch of
police is under rhe jurifdiftion of the Cap
tain of the Guard, and many inferior officers.
When any of ihefe mifcrable girls are ap
prehended, for the firft time they are put to
hard labour, <and ftridtly confined ; but for
the second they are recommitted, and many
at a time tied up in sacks, and taken in a boat
to the Pier-point, where they are' mercilessly
thrown into thefca ! ! !
" One (hudders to relate how many of
these vi&img are taken out into the sea, at
the dead of night, and committed to the
deep.
" The greater part of the wretched fuf
ferers, as may be well imagined, become
raving mad before reaching this last inhum
an aft of the (hccking â¢'y ; and such
of them at unhappily have iticfglh and firm
,n-'fs of i:ervC9 to retain fheir (enfej till the

THE KING i>. Wlt-LIAH YFOMAN.
The indiftment charged the defendant
with "whcioufly and coritemptuoufly coming
into, a Goagrygation of pioteilant dissenters,
lawfully assembled for religious worship, and
Â»nKjf% difquitting and disturbing them.
Mr. puriicy condufted the
He ft a ted to the jury the act of parliament j
011 wtiic'h die,indidbneut was founded (the
ToT?'ratio;i Aft ) ; that the diflenting con- I
gregatfon, who were the prosecutor, were
under the from the (rtqwent dist
urbances they had experienced, of profecu.-
ing fonie one individual, and they had there
fore brought the defendant befour a jury to
anfwef 'for the offence of which he had been
guilty.
The law proteÂ£lcd dissenters in the ob
servance of that mode of worship which was
agreeable to their confeiences, provided
they complied with all the reqnifitcs of the
law, and that in thjt cafe the congregation
had done so.
That on the foujth of December lad they
were engaged in religious worship, when
the defendant thought fit to diftnrb thtm
in a very grefs and indecent manner, the
particular account of which the jury would
receive from the witnesses, and if they be
lieved'thofe witnesses they could have no
hefitstitiri In pronouncing the defendant
guilty. \
Tkat the congregation were not aftuated
by any motives ; they had no re-
to and therefore when the
jury had taught the defendant by their ver
diift tHst ft* iritift riot perfid in this fort of
comduA; they would be cantcnt with an a
pology froln him, and, unless he fhonld a
gain Â«iflend, l thcy would not exaft the pun
ishment which tht law had denounced.
T\Vo witnesses graved that a congrega
tion of protestant dissenters were assembled
for religious worship, at a meeting-bouse, at
Ryegate, in Ssrry ; that while the minister
was preaching, the defendant employed
himfelfin muttering, loud enough to dis
turb those who were near him, and after do
ing so for some time, he got up and walked
towards the door, when, turning round, he
said, in a loud voice, to the minister, " damn
your eyes ; go to hell you b , I never
knew a dog go tohell without barking yet."
Upon bung, cross-examined they proved
that no provocation was given by the min
ister to the, defendant.
Mr. Knowles theo addressed the jury for
the defendant, but called no witnesses.
Mr. Justice Buller.ââ¢** oehtlemin of the
jtrry,-tftit ir an indi&ment founded on a
ftatote wbicK passed in the rtign of king
William anil queen Mary, and known by the
name of the Tuleration AÂ£h
" The objeft of this dsftute was what e
very man in his heart mud commend, to
leave every man to worship God in his own
way ; to follow tht diftates of his' own con
ference, and to observe them in such a man
ner as he thinks right, he not doing mifchief
to any other member of the community.â
It is undonbtedly to be wifhedthatgn indul
gence should be granted to all ranks of men.
" The ground of this profecutipn is, that
when this dissenting congregation were met
for the purpose of worship, the defendant,
Yeoman, thought fit to go inta this con
gregation, disturb them in that worship, and,
according to the evidence, to insult and a
buse the minister to a great degree.
" To be fuVe there cannot be more inso
lent or more abusive conduft, than that
proved on the defendant. It is said by his
Counsel he did not mean to diflurb the
congregation- Disturbing the minister, who
was then performing his duty as the minis
ter of thai congregation, is the greatest in
sult lhatlcitjkl be offered to the congrega
tion. TWothers, who were silent, were
nit ef.abufe, the mod likely ob
jeft oFibdfe was 'the minister in the aft of
preaching.
" It is proved tlijtt tlxjre were no words
used on the part of the minister that should
give him any provocation. But it should
be remembered that when people assembled
together in a place of worship for the pur
pose of paying their duty to the Divine Be
ing, a man, who does not agree in opinion
with them, is not at liberty to go into that
assembly and quarrel with the minister bc
caufe he does not happen to utter the doc
trine which is agreeable to his mind. The
objeft aud purpose of theirbeing allowed to
have such a meeting-house is, becau e they
do r.ot agree with the regular church;
they have ideas peculiar to themselves, and
they have as much right to be pleased with
their mode of worship as we have with ours,
and they protected by the law in wor
shiping God in their own way as much as
we are, if they comply with the requisites
of the law. Then these people were doing
no mere by law itey had a right to
do, when;this- man chose to go into this
chapel, infult'tflfc minister,' and didiirb the
mapner, you have heard.
" I ana hound.to tell you the evidence
brings.thist man's offence clearly within the
aft, and if you believe the evidence it is
your daty to find the defendant guily."
The j,u,ry alipoft immediately found the
defendant guilty.
Mr. Guruey then said, that the offer he
had made opening he \Vas now ready
to fulfil ; he believed the defendant was in
court, if Tie would now make an apology for
his conduft the prosecutors would not call
him up for judgment, unless he repeeted the
offence. That the congregation had not
been Jtafty or viindiftive in prosecuting, for
tin's defendant had diduibed tlu?m once be- .
fore, and had been .forgiven. I
Mr. Judice B'jHer fa id the conduct of â 
the congregation did them great honor,
and the defendant was a fool if he did not j
accept the terms they offered him.
Mr Knowles said the defendant was not
in court, but he fhouldtertainiy advifs hiiii
to do so.
For the honour of humanity, may it (land
recorded,- that towards the relief of the
Briltol infirmary, the merchants and trades
men of that city have fubferibed the sum
ofSocol. At the fame time that this dis
plays the wraith of the inhabitants, it shews
that they know how to ufc it; and when |
gold is thus applied to the necessitieS of our
fellow-creatures, we /hall cease to-dig'm'atife

LIVERPOOL, Sept. 7.'
Died, on the 29th ult. at Derby, in the
63d year of his age, after a long and'pain
ful illness, Joseph Wright, an ar
tid whose works have already procured him
thehigheft eminence in various branches cf
his profeflion. He was a pupil of Hudson,
who, though an indifferent painter himfelf,
had the honor of indrufting three of the
mod eminent painters of the age, vii. Sir
Joshua Reynolds, Mr. Wright,andMr.Mor
timer. Mr. Wright's early Historical Pic
tures may be considered as the fird valuable
productions of the Englidi School, because
Â®t the time his Gladiator, Orrery, Air
Pump, Hermit, and Blacksmith's Forge,
were painted, nothing of any conseqUence
had been produced in the historical line.â
His attention was afterwards direfted for
some years to Portrait Painting, and from
the fpccimens he has left, there can be no
doubt that he would have flood in the firft
rank in this branch of. the art, had he eho
fen to pursue it ; but his genius was not to
be circumscribed w;thin such narrow limits,
and therefore at a mature age he visited I- !
taly, tÂ» lludy the precious remain* of art i
which that country possessed :âHis fine
drawings after Michael Angeloj (which |
have scarcely been seen except by his psrti
cularfriends) and the enthusiasm with which
he always spoke of the sublime original, e
vinced the edimation in which he held them,
and from their extreme accuracy, they may
be considered as faithful delineations of the
treafuret of the Capella Scftina, and fueh a;
have never yet been exhibited to the public
During his abode in Italy, he had an op
portunity of feeing a very memorable Erup
tion of Vesuvius, which rekindled his in
clination for painting extraordinary effe&s
of light, and his different piftures of this
sublime event, stand decidedly Chief D'o>:u
-vres in that line of paintingâfor who but
Wright ever succeeded in Fire or Moon
Lights ! His late Pi&ures have been ahiefly
Landscapes, in which we are at a loss, whe
ther mod to admire, the elegance of his
outline, his judicious-management of light
and {hade, or the truth and delicacy of his
cokniriikg, but of these the part
have never been exhibited, "as they were al
ways purchased from the Ealil by amateurs
who kne\r how to appreciate their value ;
a large landscape (his lad work) how at
Derby, being a view of the Head of Ullf-'
water, may be confi4?r*d among if the fined
of his, and defervediy rankednvith the mod
valued-pi oduftionsof Wilson, or even Claude
himfelf. â¢
In the historical Line* the Dea l Soldier,
which Is now known by Heath's admirable
Print, would alone edablifh his fame, if his
Edwin, (in the pofleffion of L. Milnes, esq.
of Wakefield, who has also his deftruftion
of the lloating Batteries off Gibraltar, and
fame of his bed Landscapes,) the two pic
tures of Hero and Leander, Lady in Co
mus, Indian widow, and other historical
fubjefts, had not already afccrtaioed his ex
cellency. His attachment to his native
town, added to his natural modesty, his
severe application both to the theory and
practice ps painting, prevented his mixing
with promiscuous society, or edablifhing
. his reputation by arte which he would never
de/cend to praftice ; hi 3 friends lftng urged
him to reside in London,, but his family at
tachments and love of retirement and study
were invincible, ,and he fell a victim to his
unwearied attention to his profeflion. His
pictures have been so much in requett, that
there is scarcely an instance of their ever
having come into the hands of dealers, nei
ther have his bell works ever been seen in
Lond9n âa strong proof of their intrinsic
worth, and that no artifices were necessary
to iafure their sale. >
It is with pleasure therefore we record,
that his pecuniary circnmftances were al
ways affluent, and shew that the world had
not been unmindful of his extraordinary
talents ; and also, that, as a man, he en
joyed the frfendfhip and edeem of all who
had the pleasure of his acquaint ince.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 6.
Mr. Dent presented a memorial from
sundry inhabitants of St. Mary's county,
in the (late of Maryland, Hating that by the
lite regulations made in the eilablifhment of
Polt-Roads, they were deprived of the op
portunity of receiving news-papers as usual,
whith as they have a direst tendency topro
mote'an increase of knowledge, thry consid
er as being deprived of a blefling, and pray
for an exteniion of the road, that the evil
they complain of may be remedied.âRefer
red to a feleft committee.
Mr. Reed presented the petition of Si
meon Dunbar, stating that he pofleflcs con
tinental SectlHties ; that he neVer heard of
the aft of limitation, before the limit was
expired, and prays that they may notwith
standing be funded.
A motion to refer this petition to the
committee of claims, occafioiied some dÂ«-
Imte upon the propriety of reference of a
petition, which acknowledged the claipi to
be barred bylaw. It was,however,at length
agreed to; when 14
Mr. Williams "ford, he believed there
were many jull claims undischarged, owing
entirely to the ignorance of the persons
holding the securities, with refpeÂ£t to the
law of limitation ; for persons living on the
frontierof the country, who were probably
the bell entitled to compensation, had no
meansof becoming acquainted with the laws.
' He therefore proposed the following resolu
tion :
Rc-folved, that a committee be appoint
ed to enquire into the expediency or inex
pediency of defigriatmg certain claims to be
excepted fronv the operation of the aft Â«f li
mitation, and that they report by bill or o
therwise."
Mr. Dwicht Foster fatd, that amo
tion of this kind had bÂ«en made in the lad
winter feflion, and the committee of claims
on the 24thof February, had made a lengthy
report thereupon, which for want of time'
had not been afted upon, and which was
msntioncd in the report of unfinHhed busi
ness. He supposed, if the gentleman mov
ed this report to be committed to a commit
tee of the whole, his objcdl would be at
tained.
After 3 number of defoltÂ«ry observations,
thii motion was put and carried, and made
the order of the day far Friday.
Mr. Gordon presented a petition from
sundry inhabitants of NÂ«vr-HauipÂ£hire, com
plaining that there was no direct pod from
Exeter to Concord, and P ra ymg that fetch
a poll may be eftablifhed.âReferred to a fe
left committee. â¢
Mr. D. Foster said, he was inftrufted
by the committee of claims, to afl< leave of
the house to be discharged from the farther
confederation of the petition of Mr. Maury,
consul of the United SVates at Liverpool,
in order lhat-it might be referred to the
committee appointed to take into confidera
tiÂ«n that part of the President's speech
which rel .ted to the consuls of the United
States.âAgreed ; and the petition referred
in the way proposed.
Mr. Harper then called for the order of
the day on certain rcfolations which he had
offer*d to the confideratiim of the house on
thefubjeftof taking evidence in cases of
.contested elections.
The motion was agreed to, and the house
accordingly resolved itfelf into a commitllee
of the whole on that'fubjeft, Mr. Dent in
the chair. The rcfolutioiis were as follow :
< " Refoliui. that the method of taking evidence

Mr. Hosmer moved to amend the firft
refolntion, by adding after the word " elec
tion," in the eighth line, " or to canvass
the votes,"âAgreed.Mr. Stt.iS'aves did not miderftawl tae
uVjeft which ttu* mover of these resolutions
had in view. He knew not whether he
meant to confine the operation of his rula
to the present House of RrprefentativCs on
ly, or to all future houses. From the lan
guage of the firft resolution, he judged the
latter washia intention, Asit was hisopiuion,
therefore, that any attempt of theirs to bind
future houses would be perfectly nugatory,
he 'should move to strike out the words from,
" If it be," to "given'' (printed above in
italjc.) This resolution will then confine i
the' operation of the rule to the eleftions
which may take place during the fifth
congress. By the constitution, every house
was to judge of the elections and returps of
its own members. Tt wa3 not in the power
of any house to prescribe rules for a fue
ceeding one, for this reason, the rtiles which
governed a preceding house, were always re
vised by the succeeding one. If they were
to prescribe rules which were to be binding
on future houses, it could only be done by
an aft of the whole legislature, which
would certainly be exceptionable, as it would
give to the President and Senate a power
over the rules. for governing their proceed
ings, which, by the constitution, they were
alone the judge# of. He ftiought his ideas
on this fubjeft correft ; if they were, he
doubted, not the motion which he had made
Would be agreed to.
Mr. Harper said, if the idea of the gen
tleman last up was correft, his motion,
would donbtlefs be acceded to ; though
he did not go for enough, because in
that cafe she should have move! to have
ftftick out tlx whole clause ; because, if the
rules proposed were notjto have a permanent
effeft, they would he perfeftly nugatory.
But he apprehended his friend had not at
tended to a diftinftion, which he thought a
plain one. It was this, the power to eftab
lilh rules for the taking of evidence, and that
of judging the evidence after it wjis taken,
This house could not fay it would Â«dmit
mtmber3 under such and such difqualifica
tions, but an agreement to the mode of tak
ing evidence, was very different from the
qualifications themselves. It was essentially
necessary that legiQative andjudicial powers
should be kept diltinft, yet it was not tho't
an interference with the judicial authority,
for the legislature to direst the mode of tak
ing evidence in certain cases. Nothiny could
.be more clear than this diftinftion. It could
not be said, therefore, that because the
whole legislature direfted the mode of tak
ing evidence in cases of contested eleftion,
that the President and Senate interfered with
the constitutional direftion that every house
should he the judge of its own rules. He
was of cpinion that a law was necessary,
and a law of a permanent nature, to which
he could fee no reasonable objeftion. He
allowed that it would be uneonftitutional
for the President or Senate to interfere with
their rules or elections ; but when they
came to mike a law which was to operate
upon the whole community, their interfer
ence was necessary and proper. If these
ideas were founded, and he thought they
were, the proposed amendment would be re
jifted.
Mr. N. Smith said the motion now be
fore them, was founded upon an idea that
permanent rules could not be made for tak
ing evidence at contested eleftions. He had
frequently heard it said that rules could not
be made to be binding any longer than while
the house existed which formed them. For
himfelf he never conceived this opinion to
be correft. That it was highly important
that permanent regulations should be made
on the fubjeft in question, every one must
idmit ; it became of importance thciefore,
to know whether they had the power of
making them. When he spoke of perma
nent rules he would not be understood to
mean that any rules should be longer perma
nent than until the time came when the
house of reprefentativea should wjfh to re
scind (hem.
The idea whiph led to the conclusion of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, was this,
that every new Congress occasioned a new
House of Representatives; that whenever
the members were newly elefted, there was
a new House of Representatives. He did
not believe this doftrine to be correft. The
House of Representatives, he said was a to
tally diftinft thing from its members. The
House of Representatives, in his opinion,
always existed ; and there was 110 period at
which it could be said there was not a House
of Representatives in being. He never be
lieved it was broken in pieces one* in two
years; for when the time of one set of mem
bers expired, that of another set commenc
ed ; so that it was of the nature of a Corpo
ration, which always existed. He did not
think there had beer, four Houses of Repre
sentatives since the commencement of the
present Government, but that the whole
had been one uninterrupted House. He
thought this was the view which the Con
stitution gave of the fubjeft ; as it.spoke of
it always as a permanent body. In the fame
way, the President and Sen3te were perma
nent ; if this were not the cafe, and every
election made a new House, there was a
time when the Senate was only two thirds
of a Senate (when one-third went out of
office). This idea therefore, could not he
right. There was no difficulty, therefore,
in forming permanent rules, flnee they were,
made to gowern the House, and not the in.
dividual members. With rrfpeft to those
things which each braneh of government
had the power of doing for itfelf; each
could establish its own ruWs ; but, what re
lated to the whole government, must be the
aft of the whole. The gentleman from
Pennsylvania had said, that each House had
the power of judging of its own eleftions.
This, he apprehended, did not refer to dif
ferent Houses of Representatives, but to the
House of Representatives, and the Senate,
at each House was always considered by the
Constitution as a permanent body. He
u'as therefore opposed tb the amendment.
Mr. Nicholas believed this was a fub
jeft in which they should sever advance far
enough to come to a dtcificn. Very long
yfrty plaulible argument .i might be adduced
on both fides of title C|Ueit:on, which would
produce different effsfts on those who heard
them; but he thought the fubjeft before
them might be afted upon, without coming
to a question on that point. He supposed if
any cafe of contested elcftion came before
the House, and the evidence was taken in
such a way as to qfcertain the truth, they
should be at liberty to proceed to the ex
amination of the cafe; and therefore, all that
was wanting was, to call in the power of
the General Legislature to authorize the
attendance of witnesses to deliver their tefli
ny. Let that testimony be taken upon e
stablished and acknowledged rules, which
fatisfy every man's mind, and it will carry
conviftion with it that ir is proper. The
necessity of adopting some mode of this
kind was evident, as it was a great grievance
that perfpns difputingcleftioas fiad to come
there, to learn the mode of doisg it, before
they could proceed to take evidence. In
deed, it was putting the power of fending
members "to that house in the hands of Re
turning Officers. Jie had no doubt that
the Constitution gave them power to make
a law on the fubjeft ; if necessary the ne
ceflity of the cafe would (hew the reasonable
ness of it ; but he did not know that a law
was requisite ; he thought a rule of the
House to thteffefthe had mentioned,would
cure the evil complained of.
Mr. Sewail believed, that the great
difficulty on the fnbjeft, arose from in the
form which it presented itfelf, which had
introduced the question, whether that house
was a perpetual body Or not. He must
confefs, that he differed in opinion altoge
ther from the gentleman from Connecticut,
(N. Smith) that this house was a perpetu
al body. He thought thÂ« constitution bad j
(hewn, that though ftiere was always 'a !
House of Reprefcntatives, yet that every
houfp had only twoyeais duration ; hut be
believed, in determining the real ok>ieft"'of
this motion, there was no fteteffity for co
ming to a dccifion oti this point. Mr. S.
objeftCd to the firft resolution, on account
of the notice required to be given, which
in some cases, would present an undue elec
tion from being disputed, because the bu
siness was not taken up agreeably to the
direftion of this rule, as to time ; so that
whether the proposed regulation was to be
effefted by a rule or a lait, he thought the
firft resolution ought to be rejefted. With
refpeft to the other parts of the resolutions,
some regulation was Certainly necessary,
both as to eleftions, and as to all other mat
ters of eontroverfy which may come before
the house ; because, if some node were a
dopted for taking evidence, fafts might be
brought before the house, which could ne
ver otherwise come. As it refpe&ed electi
ons, they knew it had happened in one in
stance, and might happen in many, that a
person had held a feat in that house for a
whole- fefiioo, who was not entitled to it.â
He saw no difficulty in passing an aft .pre
scribing the mode of taking affidavits to be
laid before the two houfei of Congress.
He should venture to move that the com
mittee rife, with the intention of dis
charging it from a farther consideration of
the fubjeft, and to propose that a commit
tee be appointed to enquire into the expedi
ency or inexpediency of preftribing a mode
I for taking evidence generally, for the pur
pose-os laying it before Congress.
Mr. Harper said, if the gentleman just
fat down had uo other reason than that
which he had assigned, for making his mo
tion, he thought, on consideration, he
would not himfelf think it necessary. His
whole objeftion to the resolutions seemed
to be, to the notice required to be given.
Here was no intention, he said, of preclu
ding evidence after the time fpecified. The
sole objeft was; that testimony taken in this
way, and no other, should be admitted.â
Persons wishing to have the time extended,
might still take the evidence in this way.â
If there were a doubt on the fubjeft, an ad
ditional clause might be introduced to this
efftft. Whether the mode he had propo
sed, was the bell which could be adopted,
he could not fay. If gentlemen knew a
better, he wished them to propose it, and
let it be considered ; but'furely, because
gentlemen think some betteT rrtode may be
devised, this was not a fufficient reason for
difchatging the committee of the whole
from a farther consideration of the fubjeft.
Mr. Gordon was in favour of the com
mittee's rising, because he did not think the
resolution would have any effect, if carried.
He was of opinion with the gentleman from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Sitgreaves) that they
could not pass a rule to bind a future house,
though he thought a law might be passed
to do away the inconvenience complained
of. These inconveniences arose from there
being no law obliging witnesses to give tf
depositions in the cases mentioned. Iffuch
a law were passed, all that was complained
of would be done away.
Mr. Harper said, if the House could
pass no law upon the fubjeft to have ef
feft, then it was idle to talk about itiâ
One word upon the committee's riling. Was
it proper, he alked, after the present fub
jeft bad been printed before the House two
years, merely because gentlemen had not
given themselves the trouble to look into it,
and not because the thing is improper, but
because they have not prepared their objec
tions or amendments, to have it sent a
new committee? He thought not. If gen
tlemen wished a day or two to consider the
fubjeft, he had no objeftion to give it, but
hÂ« hoped the committee of the whole would
not be discharged.
Mr. Sitgreaves supposed, that the
question being for the committee to rife, it
would be improper to go into the merits of
the fubjeft. He rose only to give an addi
tional reason why the Committee ought to
rife. If the House passed any thing either
in the form of a law, or a resolution, the pro
visions necessary inu'ft embrace such a varie
ty of detail as could not be fettled in a com
mittee of the whole, as they fhculd be enter-
. ed into with greai caatioas'iJ :
; Indeed; the rr.odfc of precedtfre>iopft;ci (y.\
this occatlbn, inverted the itfusl order of
I things. Tiie detail of business svas always
: fettled in fclett committees, and not in com
mittees of the Vv-Tiole. r
' The motion sot t!ie committee'sri(ing was
put and carried; and upon leave being asked
to fit again, it was refuted.
Two motions were then made; one by
Mr. Nicholas, for referifirf the resolutions
to a ftletl Committee} another by Mr.
SewaU, for appointing a Committee to en
quire rnto the expediency of passing a law
regulating the taking <4f evidence generally.
The former was withdrawn to make way for
the tatter, but renewed by Mr. Rntledge,
and in order to do away (ope objeÂ£lions
which were urged agiiiiift ts!Â« mode of pro
ceeding, Mr. Harper' prpppfed to amend
the motion adding this, qij eftion to the com
mittee, viz. " to take the fubjeft matter it
felf under Coiifideration, and report, their o
pinion generally to the House."âAgreed
and a committee of five members appointed.
Mr. D. Foster, frorq, the committee of
claims, made an unfavourable* report on the
petition of Robert Hornor, which was con
curred in.
Mr. Rutdrdge presented the petition of
Robert Simmons, praying compensation for
Military Service.âReferred to the commit
tee of claims.
Mr. Harrer from the committee to
whom was referred the memorial of Thomas
Carpenter, praying for the . fiipport of the
Honfe to his American Senator, reported it
as the opinion of the committee that ao en
couragemsnt could with propriety be given
to the said work, and that the Memoria
lill have leave to withdraw his memorialâ
Mr. H. moved that this report be referred
to a committee of the whole ; but on the
motion being objedted to, as unnecessary,
it was withdrawn, and rejÂ»oit was con
cured in Ijy the House. (i . ,

scarcely be told what would bÂ« its opera

It gave so much â¢ffence, that a reward of

was proclaimed. It was conceived to be an
insult to the sovereign people, whose rights

well able to govern themselves. It wan a
libel on the aforefaid constitution, as the

As yet they have made no progress in th*

To the Inhabitants of the United
States.
SINCE the knowledge of medicine, none has ev
er proved so aftenifhingly efficacious, so uri
v rlally eflccmed, or to which the afflt&cd with
Rheumatisms,. Rheumatic Gout, Lumbago,
Pally, Sprains, Bruises and Chilblains, nYiy look
for relief with so ituich confidence, as
Whitehead's e[fence of Mujlard.
This extraordinary Medicine very loon affords
the wiflwd for relief, " even to the Kged in cales
the mofl
it is patrpniftd by all ranks of people in England.
From the gteat number ofÂ«omniunicatioTisc6n
ftantly received by Mr. John stun, he is under the
ri'Cefiify (in laying them before the world) of a
bridgin;; their contents; the following lcttters (al
thrcch curtailed) are so very important, and the
r 'cres lo very rel'peitable, that he conceives he j
fhouU be doing injutlice to lYbiubtad't EJfer.cc of
IdtiJlarJ, Were he to withhold them from puiilic in
fpecliuii.
Let'er from Mrs. Mills, Housekeeper to the Duke
of Cumberland.
Sir, Nov. 1, 1795.
A rr.otf inveterate Rheumatism and Lumbago ;
(occcafibaed by laying in a damp bed, when at
Br jtTVIS, in t!ic suit of Her Royal Highness the
Dutchtf; of Cnmberland) hasaffliAjd me eighteen
years, I have employed the firft medical gentle
men in London, and (although I derived no bene- j
fit,) am bound to acknowledge my gralitude to fc- j
vrral of the nobility, who knew my deplorable si
tuation, and humanely sent me their pliyacian> ; 1
have alio tried most advertised medicines. At j
length, fir, after eighteen years excruciating!
torture, a few bottles of your Whitehead's Effe.ice
â¢/ Mujlard. have, I thank God, restored me to the
inellimable bkfiings ot hcakh and permanent sale..
Yours, mHch obliged,

Sir, Spithead, Nov. 2, *795*
At 1 expefl to fail in a few days, 1 beg tou will
immediately forward me a dazen of Whitehead's
MJfence of Muflard. It gives me considerable fatif
faSion to inform you, I have myfelf experienced
its good effeils, and have in leveral inflances of
Rheumatisms, Sprains, and Bruises, witnessed its
a-ftonifliing efficacy- 1 think you would consult
your own interest by appointing it to be fold at
Poufmouth, and all other seaports ;'for you may
reft allured, when this invaluable fpccific becomes
gencralfy known, not an Officer in Mis Majesty s
Navy will go to sea without it.
Yours, &c.
G. COUNTESS.
Sir, Dec/Â«o, 1795-
A I'rirrc ftrokeof the Palsy, fix months ago, de
prived me of my speech, and the use of one fide.
In this desperate situation, IVhilehead' 1 Efface 0/
M.ijljrdvi3.i very strongly recommended, and, I
thank God as fuccefsfully applied. By perlevcring
in its use alhort time, I was completely reflated,
and continue to enjoy the full and perfeit use of
my faculties, although near eighty years of age.
1 Yours, W. FRANCIS,
No. T4, Arabella-row, Pimlico.
Mr. Francis has held a public situation at
the Guildhall in the city of Westminster, many
years, and is well known to the generality of the
refpc&able inhabitants.
Letter from A. McCan Esq. Capt. of the 60th re
giment,dated Fort George, Guernfiry,
Sir, (an. 4,1797
Upwards of five years past I have been affiifled
with a most violent Rheumatic Affetflion in my
head, which has baffled the skill of the most emi
nent Physicians; some months since I was induced
to try your Whitehead'> Eflence of Mujlard. I am
now happy to inform you, it has done me efiential
service.and I think itneceffary to . -dare, no other
tuedkine ever gave me the smallest degree of relief,
lam with regard,yours,&c. &c.
Capt.iotk Regt. A. MoCAN.
August, 1795:
Mr. Middleton, of Chefterfield-ftreet, St. Ma
ry le-bone was so severely affli&ed with the Rheu
matic Gout, as to be unable to move ia my bed for
fixmonths; his limbs were enormously swelled.and
at length from excessive pain became quite black.
In this distressing situation he was induced to try
your Whitehead's EJfence if Mujlard; the effeA far
exceeded the most sanguine expeSation, his pain
was immediately alleviated, and his limbs returned
to their natural colour ; his appetite restored, and
in a very Ihort time he was enabled to leave his bed
and walk with crutches; and by a few weeks per
fevtrance, was completely restored to the full en
joyment of perfect health.
%* Mr. Middleton, with his son. repeatedly
called as better," on Mr. Johnfton, and de
clared that was utterly despaired of.
RefpeaedSir, Nov. 6. 1795-
Palling by a croud, in. the fifth month of her
pregnancy, my wile received a dreadful blow on
-her fide, which apparently destroyed the life of the
infant ; after the most Ikilful advice, and trying
various remedies for two months, she still found
the symptoms increafeto an alarming degree ; fpit
ling of bloodâlhortnefs of breathâand other dif
jgreeable circumstances appeared fiom so violent a
bruise, afforded only the fatal appearance ol her
lpeedy dissolution. A friend to whom I relatÂ«d
her fad cafe, having experienced great benefit from
your Whitehead's EJfence of Mujlard, kindly present
ed me with a bottle ; to my unspeakable fatisfac
tion, it fpedily relieved her from pain ; a lecond
bottle has removed every difagreeablc symptom,
ajid with the most heartfelt gratitude I inform yoo,
we have the happy profped of her long continuing
a livine toother to our numerous family.
