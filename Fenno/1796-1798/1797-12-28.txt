(TRANSLATION.)
Extract from the regilters of the defibera- ' c
tions of the eommiffion delegated by the <
French government to the Windward ,
Iflandi. <
The commissioners, considering that their i
decree of the 23 Floreal, iri the 4th year, by j
which they take upon themselves the judg
ment of prizes, had been approved by the
executive direflory who had confidtifed the
difficult fituatipn of the eommiffion 2
Considering that the refutation of the
executive direftory dated 14 meffidor, in the
4th year, enjoining the agents of the repub
lic to treat neutral vessels in the fame man
ner as they fuffer the English to treat them,
has been the only guide of the eommiffion
for upwards of a year past, during which
they hare been left to themfelvas, without
any kind of succour, and even, without in
formation from the government :
Considering the present condition of the 1
northern part of the colony, conftantlv ,
blockaded for upwards of a twelvemonth by
an English squadron who do not permit to
enter in our ports any but such as may'ef- ;
cape their rapacity : .
Considering that the Englilh, regardkfs
of neutral flags and of the laws of nations,
stop all American veflels laden with provi
sions bound for the ports of the colony, and
carry them into the Mole, where a great
number of them are condemned :
Considering that the decrte of the execu
tive directory, dated 12 Ventofe last, com
municated by admiral Barney excites the,
eommiffion to (often the measures which had
been founded on the examples given by the
English relative to neutralsâ
Yet the eommiffion, desiring to conform
not only to the orders, but likewise to the
intentions of the executive directory, when
the fame (hall come to their knowledgeâ
have decreed and do decree as follows :
Art. 1, The decree of the eommiffion
dated 18 Nivofe last, declaring good prize
neutral vessels expedited for English ports,
and coming from the fame, is hereby re
pealed.
2d. And nevertheless, by way of re- I
prifal with regard to the English, who, in
contempt of the laws of neutrality daily take
out of thÂ«ir course, neutral vessels bound for
the French port 6 of the colony, when laden
with provisions, the French privateers are
authorized to take into the ports of the re
public, neutral refWs bound for English
ports when laden with provisions, and there
shall be paid to the said privateers by way
of indemnity, one dollar for each barrel of
flour and salted flefh meat which shall be in
troduced.
3d. The decree ef the eommiffion dated
the 6th Nivofe last declaring good prize neu
tral vessels deflfned for the ports of the Lee
ward and Windward Islands of America,
given up to the English, occupied and de
fended by the, emigrants, shall continue to
be executed according to its form and
until otherwise ordered by the commiflon.
4th. There shall be formed at the town
of the Cape a court composed of three judg
es and one reporting secretary, whieh court
(hall be charged with proceeding to the
judgment of rhe prizes, and matters incident
to and depending thereon, of which infor
mation shall have been given by the justices
of the peace, granting to them for this pur
pose, every necessary authority, jurifdiftjon
and cognizance.
sth. The eommiffion have appointed and
do appoint the citizens Adelon, captain de
Vaiffeau in the service of the republic ;
James Hngues, nephew, merchant at the
Cape ; Cormaux, the elder, lawyer and no
tary at the Cape, judges of the said tribu
nal ; have named and do name citizen Po-.
, lony, the elder, lawyer, and interpreter of
the \ English language, reporting secretary
of the said tribunal, without having a delib
' efative voice therein.
I 6th. The secretary shall report to the
said court the business which shall be bro't,
as well as the oppofitionÃ and incidents
â which may be presented to it ; and the
. Judgments therein rendered on the fubjett
; of the said prizes (hall be by Kiir> delivered,
, and he shall be allowed a commiflon for the
more speedy expedition of the business, and
: the minutes of the said judgments and all
the papers relative to the prizes shall be de
-1 posited by the said secretary among the ar
- chives of the eommiffion.
7th. The judges of the peace shall fend
J to tht said secretary the proceedings of in-
I formation and all the papers found on beard
: of the said prizes, and the secretary shall
keep an exaft account of all the proceed
ings sent to him, and of the day on which
* he ffiall have recÂ«ived them ; and they shall
proceed in the following decade at fartheft,
to the judgment of the prize, unless a claim
ant should present himfelf.
Bth. The judgment of the prize court
(hall be submitted to the revision of the eom
miffion.
9th. The members of the said prize court
/hall tax the judgments according to equity
and good conscience, and shall be held to
write wi|h their hands, on the minutes of
the judgments on which they shall take em
oluments the taxes they shall have imposed,
and the said judges aid secretary of the said
n court shall receive no other compensation
than those allowed them by the present ar
t j tide.
I 10th. The allowance of the the two and
8 ' a half per cent, to the justices of peace by
' the arret of the 26 Frimaire in the sth
- year is and shall be reduced to one per cent.
( only, for all the expences of sale and liqui

MR. brown, ri
From the report of the secret committee, e
' now pubbfhtd' by order of the Houfc of Re- tl
prcfcn!atiVcs'', it appears, page 14. that on v
â  the iathofjuly the Spaniih minister, the b
1 Chevalier d'Yrujo, called on the committee J
1 anct made a communication marked A.B.C, v
1 in the appendix to (the report, page 133. si
t and of which the following is an exact tranf- d
- lation. viz. c
" Copy of a declaration made to the minister t
â  of his Catholic 3fujejly, by Citizen Mitchell, f
' an inhabitant if the State of Teneffee."
1. That there have been inTifted by the {
1 person called: Chidiolm,an English.agent and t
â  an inhabitant of Teneffee, 1000 inhabitants 1
of" that state, who are deftkied for an at- t
â  tack on the ports of Baton Rouge of Nc<w {
1 Gates and of Eiors a Marfot." 1
2. " That Chifholm has reconnoitered
i the whole of Louisiana and of the two Flo- t
t ridas, and has takan ftrps for engaging the t
Creek and Cherokee Indians to turn their ]
â  arms against the Spanish possessions." 1
3. " That Chifholm has obtained a lift, (
e which he now holds, of 1500 Tories, or <
i English royalists at the Natches, who have 1
e engaged to take up arme in favour of the â¢
English the moment they /hall appear to at
a tack Lower Louisiana, and to inarch from ]
e thence against Santa Fe." i
1 4. " That there is now affeaibling, on 1
- the Lakes, a force Composed of 500 English
regulars, 700 Canadian militia in pay, and
1 2000 Indians to be commanded by captain
e Brandt."
i, 5. " That this force is to descend the II
:- linois river, and attack St. Louis and New-
Madrid : from whence, following the eourfe
- of the river St. Francis, and Ackanfas, it
n i- to march against Santa Fe." â¢
e 6. " That Chifholm has procured fix field
r pieces, the fame which were to have been
n employed in Genet's expedition, and has
e lodged them in the hands of his agents on
:- the Teneffee river."
h 7. " That the rendezvous for the A
e mericans, is fixed at Knoxville on theTen
y iieffee, on the firft of Joly."
if 8. " That consequently Chifholm, who
1- has made the proper dispositions on all these
heads, and reported them to the minister
d Lifton, who was to take his passage on the
I- 28th of March from Philadelphia to London
on board of a 'vcfCrl cleared out for Hambro'
i, in order to commuiucate his proje& to the
government* aJid d?nÂ»and ships and money
o for its exaction.? m
r, 9. " Finally, as proof of what he has al
i. ledged, Citizen Mitchell placed in my hands
n an official letter from Chifholm, a copy of
r- which is hereiHito annexed."
rt Done at Philadelphia, July 12. 1797.
le This date of July 12th 1797 evidently
it refers to thetiisewben the Chevalier d'Yrujo
r- made a copy of this communication for the
cs of being presented to the Commit
r- tee, and not to the time when the commu
>n nication itfelf was made to him This copy,
which I have examined, is in the hand-wri
id ting of the Chevalier .* and as appears by
le the report as ahove cited, was presented to
:; the committee the next day; viz : July 13
le There is in tire margin of the paper, a note
o- alio in the hand writing of the Chevalier
II- d'Yrujo, which by some accident does not
o-. appear in the printed copy, and which dates
jf that the communication was made by Mitch
ry ell to the miniftrr on the 20th of March
b- This diftinftian of dates is important; and
it is further confirmed by thecommuiiication
iie itfelf ;fin the eighth clau(e of whichit isftat
t, ed, " that Chifholm, having made his dif
ts positions See. tuet 'U fail from Philadelphia
ic to London ow the 28th of March. The
dt term " was tofail" (devoit pariir) manifeftly
d, refers to a future day; and consequently the
he communication was made brfart thu 28th of
id March, and while Chifholm <was flill in Phi
ill ladelphia. This also is a circumstance im
le- portaut to be remarked. It is, moreover,
ir- the Chevalier d'Yrujo, having
received this communication on the 2D th of
nd March, as appears from the above mention
n- ed note, must have known that Chifholm
rd was to remain in Philadelphia 8 days after
all this disclosure of his designs took place,
d- Why then did not the Chevalier d'Yrujo
ch commtnicate this discovery to our govern
all ment on the 20th of March, and in-all the
ft, details in which he had received it ? Chi
na- fholm was yet in Philadelphia, and might
have been arretted. The difpatehes with
irt which he was charged might have betn ex
m- amined. The whole scheme might have
been arretted and broken up in its infancy,
irt Was it so uninteresting to us, that the mi
ty nifter of afriendly nationcould have thought
to it not worth difelofing ? Certainly net;
of for it was, if real, to involve our neutrality
m- and out peace-; and even if fidtitious, as in
d, all its most material parts it has appeared to
lid be, still it mightJbecome the ground of mif
on understanding and jtaloufies between us and
ar- our neighbours, and a motive, or a pretext
for delaying the executioh of our treaty with
nd hiÂ§ own nation.
by In this latter way we find that he adtual
tb ly did use it. Tnftead of difelofing it to our
it. own government, which could have crushed
ui- it at once, he concealed it from us, and loft
lid no time in notifying it to the Spanish gov
to, ernor of Louisiana, who immediately nwde
Â»c- it a pretext for retaining the forts, and re
fufing to execute any part of the treaty. -
to It is evident therefore tha't the Spanish mi
ed nifter did not wish to fee Chifholm's projedts
defeated, but to find in them a pretext for po
withholding the posts on the. Mfiifippi.â go
There is little doubt of his being under the ha
orders of a malignant Frenchman, known vvc
for his unbounded hatred to this country and j M
its government; and generally considered as trj
the secret agent of France in this country, an
In this tpnfadtion therefore we may plainly wl
discern the traces of French hostility and br
intrigue, which, for.the piirpofe of ruling pa
this country, unceafisgly attempts to excite w!
its people against its government, and so- th
reign nations against the country itfelf. j th
Should itbefaid that the Chevalier d'Yru- th
jo did give our government this information hi
' I answer, No. On the second of March he b)
spoke to the Secretary of (late of " the just so
reasons which he j.ad for fufpedb'ng that an is,
expedition was preparing on the Lakes oh w
the partof the English," the objedt of which di
was " to attack upper Louisiana, and take,
: by furpril'e, the posts of St. Louis and New it
: Madrid," and declared that the proofs m
, which he had been able to obtain after the k
firft verbal mention of that fubjedt, a few at
â  days before,had confirmed him in his fufpif- ifr
cion that the ErigliÂ£h troops, meditatiug j a]
â¢ this Coup-de-Main, intendedtopafs through ci
, some parts of our territory. al
In answer to this he was assured by the ( p
: Secretary of state, on the nth of March, c;
1 that the government of the United States ' el
s had no knowledge of any circumstances in- ti
- dicative of such a design, and would pur- n
> sue all proper measures for protedting the ;f<
neutrality of their territory. ' o
1 Nothing further passed on the fubjedt till k
- the 21 ft of April fallowing, one month as- d
: ter the Chevalier d'Yrujo had received o
r Mitchell's communication, and twenty-three id
days after the time at which, as he knew, 1<
, Chifholm was to fail for London. On that a
r day, he wrote a second letter to the Secret
e tary of state, which is in the following a
e words : r
" Whilst I possess new reasons for be- p
(l Jieving that it is intended to carry into ef
fect the expedition agarntt Upper'Louifiana c
n on the part of the English, by violating the r
h territory of the United States, as was man- I
d ifeftec} to you in my letter ofthp2dof March r
n last, I must add that I know, to a'certainty, t
that the English have made propositions to t
1- general Clark, of Georgia, in order to avail e
themselves of his influence in that state, to- e
"e â  gether with some other persons, for mak
it ing a diversion, or serious attack, against
Florida ; and as by your letter of the nth
d of last month, you assure me that the Uni
n ted States would take theneceffary measures
is for causing their neutrality to be refpedted.
n Ido not doubt that in confequencc of this
my information, the executive government
l- will take proper steps, in order that Geor
l- gia also should not infringe the Jaws of neu
trality to the injury of the poffefiions of the
io king my matter."
fe Here there is not the smallest hint of the
er information received from Mitchell, which
le related to this very fubjedt, and which it
m was so important to ourgovernment to pot
s' fefs. No hint given of any details, nor
le is any single circumstance brought into view
:y whereby the government could be led to
fufpe6k that its own citizens were engaged
il- in the projeft ; or directed to the proper
is sources of information. By this condudt,
of which, to speak the 'most tenderly of it, was
most disingenuous and unfriendly, our gov
7. ernment was kept wholly in the dark about
ly a plot, of the most serious import to its in
jo terefts and its peace, which, to the knowl
:ie edge of the Spanilh minister, was then go
it- ing on, and which he was himfelf, using as
u- a pretext for refufing to execute a folemu
jy, treaty.
ri- Such, throughout this affair, has been
iy the conduct of this person, who with a neg
to left of decorum whereof diplomatic history,
[3 before the days of the French republic, ne
te ver furnilhed an example, has dared to infin
er uate that our government was desirous of
ot conniving at enterprises formed, in the
:es heart of our eountry, against, the poffef
h- Cons of Spain.
h Norhanhis conduit been ltfs marked with
nd a disregard of truth, than with a negleft of
on decorum. On the 26th of March 17971
it- the Secretary of state wrote to him, by or
if- der of the President, requesting to be in
iia formed what steps had been taken for with
he drawing the Spanish troops from thÂ« posts
Jy on the Miffifippi, pursuant to our treaty
he with Spain, the ratifications of which had
of then been exchanged nearly eleven months.
hi- To this enquiry, on so important a fubjedt,
m- and from so refpedtable a quarter, he delay
er, cd to answer for more than a month ; a de
ng lay which the ordinary forms of civility be
of tween individuals, would have forbidden in
m- the cafe of a private note on the most triv
lm iaJ fubjedt. At length, on the 17th of A
ter pril, he answered in fourlines, faying " that
not having received letters from the gover
ijo nor of Louisiana for many montht, he knew
:n- nothing about the matter and that "an
he indisposition, from which he bad not yet re
hi- covered, had prevented him from replying
rbt sooner !" Prevented for a whole month,
th by an indijpo/itioa, from writing a note of
:x- four lines, in answer to an important en
ive quiry from the President of the United
;y. States ! Yet that indisposition neither con
ni- fined him to his house, nor prevented him
rbt from feeing Mitchell, on the 20th of March
st ; 4 days after the enquiry from the President
ity had been made, from examining him, and
in taking down his examination in writing, at
to considerable length, and with his own hand !
us- Such was the condudt of this person, who
md made it a pari of hr* insolent accsfations
:xt against the Secretary of state, that a cem
ith muiiication of his own, made on the idot
March, and requiring careful examination, ;
lal- was not answered till the nth of March;
aur although during this short period, of 9 days,
led one President had gone out o-f office and a- 1
[oft nother come in, aiid all the hurry of bufi
ov- ness attending the close of a fefGon yf eon
ade grefs had intervened !
rc- But why, it may be asked, did this min
ister depart from his system, and lay before
mi- the committee a copy of Mitchell's cusmmu
:dts nication ? It certainly was sot for the pur-
pose of giving information by which our
government might be enabled to aft ; for
had that been the motive, the disclosure
would have been made to the executive, ia
; March, while fchifholm was yet in the.coun
try, and with his papers, might have been
arretted. The information was withheld
when it might have been ufefal, and was
brought forward at a time when it wascom
paratively of little importance, at a time too,
when the explosion having taken place, and
the discovery being made by other means,
the Spanish niinifter might have supposed
that the best method of avoiding the poxTi
bility of appearing as a party in thebufinefs,
by reason of his concealment, wasto turn in
former, and tell what he knew about it. It
i is, probably, in this way of thinking that
i we mult search for the naotives of his con
i dust.
, As to th:s communication of Mitchell,
r it has appeared to bo utterly falfe in all its
3 mod material points. Every body now
; knows that no collection of troops ever was
r attempted on the lakes, or elsewhere on our
- i frontier, and not a fhadowof evidence has
r ; appeared to prove that Chifholm had pro- L
a cured any cannon, or engaged any persons,
at tlie Natches, or elsewhere, to join in his
e projedt, except fclount. The whole story A
, came from Chifholm, who told it to Mitch
s ' ell, and vvho, from the report of thecom
- rnitte?, and the examinations which are an
- ncxed to it, appearsto be a lying babbling
e ; fool, entitled to no credit or attention, nor
! obtaining any from a single person who
II knew him. And yet this is the story, thus
> derived, and thus supported, which, with
d out proof, without enquiry, and without
e 1 disclosure to our government by whom a
â¢, lone the proper enquiries could be
it and the proper steps taken, is madethe pre
text for refufing to execute a folealn nation
g al treify, whereon depends many important
rights and interests |"of two countries, and Â»
â - perhaps their peace.
f- The people of the United States will dif
a cern the hostile head whereby this machine
e ry is secretly moved; and while they cannot
l- help bestowing forae small portion of indig
h nation on the contemptible agent who is of
r, ttnfibly employed, they will find in these
0 tranfadtions, new motives for repelling, with
il energy and watohfulnefs, the open and cÂ»n
-- eealed aggreflions of his dire&ers.

Mr. Shepard having made the motion on
the ground of mistake, and another mem
,f. ber who voted with him having seconded it,
or Mr. Pinckney said,. if the question were
, w to be re-considered, he fhouid wjfh to hear
t0 the reasons why gentleman wilted the !Ã¼b
e(J jest to be so long postponed. He thought
, er the provisions in this bill were much better
} than those which at present regulated the
, as arming of vessels :he wished, therefore,
, v _ that the business might net be so long defer
ut red. .
n . Mr. Otis hoped the vote would be re
,]. considered. He thought much less time
r Q . would be fufficient for gentleman to inverti
ng gate this fubje&. He wished that the bu
nH finefs might be coolly examined, and that
such measures might be Adopted, with ref
er, peÂ£t to the arming of our merchant vessels,
,g. as the good of the country required ; and
r y ; not, when a fubjedt of as great magnitude
le . as any which might be discussed during the
; n . session, was brought before the house, that
of the consideration of it should be postponed,
h e by a silent vste, for four weeks. He tho't
e f_ such a measure very extraordinary, and preg
nant with humility and disgrace to the
j t ]i country, at a time when our fuffering com
0f merce called aloud for proteftion. Whether
they would protest it or not, is a question
3r . which should be fairly considered aud deter
in. mined upoa , but, when a proposition was
th- was brought forward, which had a view to
,ft s this fubjeft, by what latent fear, he asked,
ity were gentleman palsied, that such a measure
IJt d should be thus procrastinated ?He invoked
h B . the Genius of the Country to rescue the
A Union from the disgrace which hung over
j V - over it ; that a time when the commerce of
d* e _ the Country, which had so greatly contri
be- bnted to its prosperity, lay prostrate, and
; n a bill was reported which had in view its
â¢iv. prottftion, a motion should be agreed to to
A- the consideration of it for four or
hat five weeks. He hoped gentlemen would
r e r- not persist in thus a&ing ;he wished as long
iew a time to be given as was necessary for
an confideringthe fubjeft, but notthat it should
re- be laid behind the curtain, on account of
ing any fears which gentlemen were unwilling
th, to disclose.
of Mr. Harper trufled his friend from Maf--
en- faehufetu, when he informed the house he
ted should be sgainfl reconsidering thr question
on- would not impute his eon4uÂ£t to fear. He
lim voted for making this fubjeift the order of
rch the day for the firft Monday in February,
eftt not because he felt any fear, but he did it,
and and he should do it-agaio, because the Will
at brought into view a fubjsdt, for the difcuf
id ! fion of which they were not prepared. â
?bo" Why not prepared ? Becauff, at tie last
ons fefTioii, they had negatived,- contrary to
jm- his opinion of what ought to have been
[of done, the defenfive measures then pnipofed ;
On, I for he then thought, and continued to think
:h ; i that it would have been well to have follow
,ySj ed up pacific ftepsby energetic measures of
1a- defence. He did all he could to induce the
ufi- house to be of this opinion, but he was
on-' not fuccefsful ; and as it had been resolved
to leave the state of things as they found
iin- them he meant to adhere to this relolutior.,
'ore until he heard from oar negociators. When
nu- ever the time should come for this country
>ur- to trfke meafutts of defence, he truftcd his
" *friend from Massachusetts would not find
him behind hand ; if there was a neccGcy
for repelling force hebdieved there
would not be much difference of opinion in
the house on the fubjedl, at least he should
be feund ready so to determine. Bi,Â»t he
thought it would be Well to postpone the
farther coivfideration of this bill till the pe
riod proposed. If intelligence, in the mean
time, were received from our negotiators,
they could call it up foonerby a vote of the
house. Mr. H. fafd, when he gate his
vote, he understood the time to be the firft
Monday in January ; but he was well fa
tisfied to let the business stand as it was.
Mr. Rutledge did not think .the reasons
which his colleague had given fed- his vote
were fa wÂ«ighty as those upon which he
generally adtcd. He reprefenttd this at a
hoftil* measure. For his part, he did not
view it in that light, but merely as a mea
sure of precaution. He believed the mer
chants had a right to arm, and he believed
they would arm; and he thought it right
for Congress to fay they should arm, only
under certain reftridlions; and he did not
think that a majority of that House, from
hearing the bill once read, could be prepar
ed to fay the reftridtions therein contained
were improper or incompetent, and that
the bill was incapable of being modified, in
such a way as to effedl the end proposed.
All that was asked for was my difcuffwn.
If, when it came to be examined, the Bill
could not be so modified as to answer the
purposeâor, if it should be thought that
war would be the probable consequence of
its adoption, then let it be rejedled. But
why, exclaimed Mr. R. in the name of Ci
vilty, of Politeness, of Prudence, may it
not be admitted to a discussion? He had
not longhad a feat in that House, but it
the firft time he had seen a fubjedt so
disposed of by a silent vote. His colleague
had said, theffubjetf, notwithstanding the
postponement, could at any time be called
up by a vote of the House; he alio knew,
that if an earlier day were fixed upon, it
could always be postponed, and this was a
mush mare usual course of acting. The de
lay wa3 proposed, it was faid,that we might,
in the mean time, hear fromottr Commiifion
eri. He thought so long a delay unnecessa
ry on this account. He expc&ed to bear
from them daily and hourly. The firft
easterly wind might waft their diff>atches to
hand. Bcfides, if they went on to mature
the bufincfs, and the negociation fliould ter
minate measures, no mifchief would have
been done; but if the negociation should
have a different termination, and they did
net go on with the bufincfs, so much time
would have been loft. He had little doubt
from the very prompt mode of negociation
pra&ifed in France, that the issue of our ne
gociation would not be long unknown; he
wished, however, their usual promptness
might not take place, and that we might
not receive quite so early intelligence. But
exclaimed Mr. R. is this a declaration of
war! No; though it might appear to be so,
from the strong fcuri of some gentlemen.
If the proposition were to go to war to-mor
row, thofeftars could not be -stronger; tho'
in reality, the question was no more than td
arm merchants vefltls against pirates; a
measure quite as fafe as arming persons for
their defence, when going into a back
country, against Indians or others who
Â» might attack them. The haufe had been
told some days ago, by a Gentleman from
Maryland, (Mr. S. Smith) w'nofe opinions
ou commercial fubje&s bad always great
weight, that some of bis constituents had
infilled upon their right to arm, that they
had armed, and they heard the consequence.
It was the wish of the friends of this Bill to
prevent thÂ«fe sonfequences in future. He
hoped, thertfore, the question would he
reconftdered.
Mr. Brookes thought the day mentioned
too distant. It was five full weeks from
yesterday. He perfeftly agreed in senti
ment with the gentleman just fat down, and
would not, therefore, repeat what he had
said. He was sorry to find any alarm rais
ed upon reading a bill, purporting to be a
supplement to a former aft, as to the man
ner of arming private vessels against lawless
buccaneers. Why postpone the considera
tion of this fubjefk, until we hear from our
negoeiators ; fincej if a peace in Europe
were to take place to-morrow, some such
measure would be necessary, as our seas
would continue to be infefted witk marau
ders ? He was under no apprehension of a
hasty decision on this fubjeft. If the ques
tion was whether the bill should pass, there
might be some ground for alarm ; but to
be alarmed in the present stage of thÂ« busi
ness, appeared as if they were afraid of do
ing any thing left they fkould offend the
powers at war. He should be the last man
to do any thing which should have a tenden
cy to involve the country in war ; but he
would not, from this fear, postpone Â« busi
ness with which no foreign nation had any
thing to do. HÂ« was, therefore, for recon
sidering the question.
Mr. M'Dawell was not a little surprised
to hear gentlemen so warm ou the present
question, attributing fear to others, and be
llowing all patriotism upon themfeves. He
did not know how it could have happened
that fear could have so immediately got
pofleffien of a majority of the house on this
ocafion ; nor did he know how the gentle
man from Massachusetts (Mr. Otis) had
come by this information, that fear was the
impelling motive. Had he been as anxious
to be heard, and as capable of speaking as
that gentleman, he probably should not have
given a silent vote on the occasion ; but he
would inform that gentleman that many
who vtfted in the majority on this occasion,
â¢were incapable of adting from fear. This
queftionhad been discussed at the last feflion;
it was then determined spot to authorize a
nv arming which should endanger the peace
of the country. Negoeiators had been ap
pointed ; this negociation was now pend
ing, and taking up a fubjedl of this fort
might have an unfavourable effedl upon it.
It was, therefore, clear to him, that they
bad better postpone the difc&ffton, tifnil
they heard from France, which he did not
expect to do, so soon as the gentleman from
S. Carolina, (Mr. Rutledge) expedted.
Mr. Isaac Parker fa id, it was not the u
sual courfcof bufincfs, to postpone the dis
cussion of a bill to a. distant day, except it
were with a view of defeating it. A quef
tiori, then arose, what could be reason of this
postponement. The gentleman from N.
Carolina last up, had condescended to an
swer this question, by faying that it was
from the wish not to affedt our present nego
ciation. This could not possibly be the
cafe ; and he thought, on the contrary, that
this was the best possible time for taking up
this, or any other step which had relation to
the defence of oUr country. If they were
n<4 to pass a law for the defence of our citi
zens, because a negociation was pending
with a foreign country, the honour and in
dependence of the country were gone, and
they might as well cease to make laws at all.
The pending negociation would be fwccefs
ful or unfuccefsful. If fuccefsful, a law of
this kind would We necessary, as it was not
intended for the protedliion of our commerce
against any particular nation, but as a sys
tem of defence against the pirates of all na
tions. But suppose the negociation prove
unfuccefsful ; when wc know this, said he,
it would be too late to take the measure
proposed ; and our commerce will be whol
ly unproleded, and exposed to the depreda
tions of the French, or any other country.
He hoped, therefore, the question would
be re-considered.
Mr. Hartley was not for precipitating a
measure of so much importance as this was ;
but he thought the proposed poftponemeÂ»t
too distant. He agreed with the gentleman
last up that they had a right to make the
proposed regulation, without having refpedi
to any foreign nation. The commercial inter
efts of this country seemed to call for fotne
measure of the kind. He hoped, therefore,
the queftign would be reconÂ£dered, and
that they should make the bill the order of
the day forthefecond Monday in January.
Mr. Nicholas said, it was easy to discover, by
the manner in which gentlemen took up this bu
siness, that ther* was more in it, than they \yere
ready to acknowledge. He underflood it to" be
neither more nor lels than the question which was
argued at the last fefEon, and then negatived. If
he were not miflaken in this, it was for him to in
voke the Genius of Americaâto call down the
Guardian Angel of Peaceâto invoke its aid a
gainst the designs which gentlemen seamed to have
on the prrfent oecalion. It was his opinion, that
a bufincfs of this fort, moved at the present day,
was ten times as objectionable, and had an appear
ance fen times as suspicious, as when lormer'y to
jefled. Were h; not juftified, then, in wishing
ehis question net to be agitated, when our Gtua
tion was no way more suited to such a measure
than when formerly di'culTcd ? To go into a mea
sure of this kind, at this time, would refle<Buprn
the inflability of our councils, and be (fifgracoful
to them. What was to be inferred, he alked,
from a deG-e to go into the buGncfs of arming at
present ? He hoped, and trusted, and believed,
that there was no difpofitioo in that house to throw
obftades in the way of the negotiation, so as to
defeat it ; if he could conceive any such intention
to exist, he ihould think such a measure as was
now proposed, calculated to produce the effeS.
To discuss this fubjedt, and authoriGng the arming
of our velfels, would bÂ« to set adrift the passions
of focicty, and the confcquence could not fail to
be mifchiev us. The details of the bill confirmed
him in this opinion ; the regulations were mere
cobwebs, and would, by no means,, be equal to
the preventing of abuses It would be placing
the pe?ce of the courti y in the hands of every man
who owned a Ihip. If, thea lherÂ« were neihing
new in ourGtuation ; nothing which made a charge
of policy nee.'lTnry, why go into this fubjeS ? Did
not gcntl'mcn recoiled! the heat which had been
produced bv t! e difcuflion on a former occaGon ?
I) they did, why did th.y wish to anticipate the
question ? It could only tend to dtftroy that har
mony which would be so dcGrable in e so of this
country being obliged to have recuurfc to the dtr
tier rrfort. But they had been told, that il some
regulations were not entered into, great mifchiÂ«f*
be ex from merchants arming without
rellrielion, and a tingle inflance of abuse had been
mentioned. This was all, he beiisved, which
could be produced, and he did not thiDk, therefore,
the peace of the country would be much hazarded
[mm this fou-ce. He could fee no evil that could
arifefrom letting the bufincfs remain upon itsprn
frnt footing for a month or two loÂ»ger. He.uc
lieved the aieceffity fpokeu of for going into this
measure as merely it/ml, aud that it would have
no effed, but that of inflaming the minds of the
people for war. As to what had fallen from the
gentleman frÂ«m Massachusetts (Mr. Otis) in his
appeal to the Geuiut of the Country, &c. he con-
Gdered merely as a touch of the Mcil Heruic. He
thought the milder Genii should only be refortcd
to. Tho only Senilis which he wifhtd to appeal to
was the Genius of Pease. We were not, He said,
ripe for War. Our plans had hitherto been paci
fic, and he did not wish at present to change them.
HÂ« hoped, therefore, the vote taken would not be
revoked. ' |

HAGUE, Oflober 13.
At the fittingof this day, the committee
of marine communicated a letter addressed to
them by Vice-Admiral De Winter, written
yesterday, on board the BWtifh Admiral
Duncan, and received at 10 o'clock this
morning by exprefj. Oftliis affedling let
ter, the following is a summaryâit caused
the liveliest sensations of grief among the
members of the afiembly.
" ft is with the deepefl regret that I address
to you the present dispiitch. Ttjlcrday mor
ning at II o'cloii we discovered the Englith.
We ranged in order of battle. I made the
signal for forming the line as compact as pojjible,
which however was very imperfectly obeyed.
" .712 o'clock the enemy attacked the extre
mity of our line. They soon afterwards un
dertook to force it. The aSion became
general, and I found myfelf engaged with three
of their Jhips. The Hercules tookjire. and
driving towards mine I was under the mceJJity
of changing my pojition, to avoid her, which ob
liged me to approach 'a fourth of the enemy's
vefels, that of the Admiral. I very soon lojl ah
my rigging, and it became impracticable to conti
nue myJxgnals. Meanwhile the enemy took
poffbffion of the Wajfenaar, Harlm, FrtÂ£ar,
Delft and Jupiter,
" The smoakprevented me from diJlinSly
observing the Jlate Â»J our affairs. The aSion
<was one of the brijkejl / have witnejfed. Sf.
ter losing a conftderable part of my crew, I
endeavoured by a vigorous pujh, to force the
Jive Englijh J, lips -which surrounded me, &to
gain the coajl, or join the remains oj my Jleet.
At two o'clock all three oj my majls went by
the boardâAfter this / continued fighting
half an hour, when my Jlag was carried
away and the crew, reduced to lalj its number
teaicd to Jire. At I I was bearded by an
Engliih frigate, and conduced on board Admi
ral Duncan. The Egality was not far from
meâl observed her to cease firing, having 101 l
all 'her rigging. IVhy the, as well as the
Friffar, Diljt and Harlem Jlruck, I cannot
determine. The Hercules were obliged to cut
away her majlsâ-Jhe was on Jire, but it was
soon put outâJhe, however, drove into the
British Jleet, and -was taken.
" I am perfectly fatisfied with my officers
and erew, 1 they fought with infinite bravery,
as did also the enemy. The loss of men on
both fides has been very groat.
" The British fleet whjcb had put into
Yarmouth, set fail again irrfjjiediately on re
ceiving news that we were a! fca. It was
joined by several veflels from Portfmauth
and the Downs. Their force confided of
sixteen ships of the line, principally 74's.
Â«Â« This is the most unhappy day of my
life all our best manoeuvres, and all our
courage were fruitlefs. The enemy esteems
us on account ef our vigprotis rtfiftanct.â
No aftion could have been more desperate
and bloody.
" I (hall do myfelf the honor of transmit
. â¢ i' â ' â  i;â¢
ting you a more accurate detail by the next 1
opportunity. I now cfn'y avail myfelf of i
tlic permission granted by admiral Duncan,
to forward this Jltettfh. j
" I cannot give you any precise informs- '
tion, refpefling' the other (hipsâl am told
Vice Admiral Reintcr is (lightly wounded,
and a piifoiier on board Vice Admiral Onf
low.
" I cannot fay how many Engliih (hip 9 i

P HILJ.D ELPHIA,
THURSDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 28.
A letter from a gentleman in New-York
to a Member of Congress, informs of the
arrival of Mr. David Meredith of this city,
from Bourdeaux.
The letter further states that our envoys
011 their arrival at Paris, presented their cre
dentials to the ruling power. At the time
of Mr. Meredith's departure, three weeks
had elapsed, without any recognition or
other notice of them.
For the Gazette oj the United States.
LETTER 11.
DEAR SIR,
IT is not necessary to call in the aid of
written authorities to assist or confirm the
principles on which it is now found so evi
dently to be the interejl of every nation to en
deavour as much at pojjible to cultivate the in
valuable blejfings of peace, if it was there is
not one on the fubjeft of the laws or interest
of nations, or evÂ«?n a modern Engliih writer
of political eminence to whom I could not
recur for proof of what has been observed in
my last. If then it is a general interest, it
is meftparticular to the United States.
In my letters of 1794 (of which I have
not any notes by me) I think it was observ
ed on this fubjeft " that possessing a fuffici
ency of territory at home it is not her in
terest, nor can it therefore be the calm in
clination of the United States for time bey
ond ours to attempt conquest, the only re
ward that could attend even a fuccefsful
warfare" this it is her interest to Jhun, con
sequently to avoid every cause that can pos
sibly tend to involve her in a contest with a
ny of the nations of Europe, from whom
thank Heaven (he is so widely separated.
The wisdom and firmnefs which canvafs'd
and calmed the ftormjuft over, which (leer- |
ed the (hip of state over all the quick sands
of clamour, the rocks of rashness, the (hal
lows and (hoals of felf-created societies and
" defeated the arts of falfe and felfifh po
pularity addressed to the feelings of avarice"
(6) will remain recorded in the admiring me
nwry of mankind -while gratitude retains a name
amongfi the virtues of a patriotic people ! The
important precedent is a legacy to the whole
human race, all the nations of the earth may
derive advantage from it ! the unshaken
loftinefs (forgive (&e expreflion ye societies
of reformers by one man Was ena
bled to listen, to examine, to enquire and
search, to deliberate and coolly determine
the best path to pursue in a point of so ranch
importance, amidst the anger of a justly in
censed and dearly beloved society of friends
and fellow-citizens, and fellow fuffererstoo)
when all the paflions, a warring world, a
popular and favorite fubjeft invited or seem
ed to offer redress or at least revenge !
(which the inconliderate too generally be'
cause hastily eonfider the fame) is a theme
for future ages to celebrate and annually ob
serve as a day of thank/giving, and for every
patriot Jlatefmati and legislator to imitate.
Accustomed tothe care and caution which
conveyed us clear of this|important difficulty,
we are apt to think and speak of it, with
all the indifference of the (lighted danger !
but throughout the reft of the world, how
is it extolled ? the character of a man, al
ready raised beyond the steady height which
fame had ever reached and kept, (7 ) is ex
alted to the highest pitch of-magnanimity.
His country's character is benefited by the repu
tation of policy and firmnefs -which his conduS
bn this occajion has obtained it; the republican
form of government is recommended by the de
monstrated proof of his admioiftration on so
trying an occasion, that it is equally capable
of energy with monarchy r and superior to it in
moderation.
Such are the comments heard throughout
Europe, everywhere I palled from Denmark
through the free cities, Germany, Holland
â  and the whole republic of France 5 even
where the ruling powers praftice and wi(h
to have seen us display a different system, as
individuals they admire that moderation and
temper which an attentive world must wish
(6) Annie's auarels to Ucn.ral Washington,
Nov. 1783.
(7) l or 11 years fuceeffively the chosen charm i
on and ruler of five millions of men, unrewarded
but by their [love and praise !
had been companioned with the bravery acd
spirit of a people contending in the. glorious
cause of liberty, ellewhere; we may indeed
with propriety apply Mr. Addifon's eulogy
on Marlborough's feats, to our Fabius's nc.-
tions.
" Rah dos them],'elvesÂ« their genuine charms they L oaJi )
" And thofttbatpaint them trucji praise them most. u
The poli icians of thofeeountries juftmer
tioned whose observations I remark as ap
plicable to our own, not only admit and
praise the propriety, of that conduit which
haa preserved our peace but have frequently
expressed opinions "that nothing could have
pleased the government which raised our re
sentment better, than to have forced us to
afts of hostility, and that she was disappoint
ed to Gnd her youthful children so deliberate
ly -wife, being able, prepared as she was at
a very little expence to have retarded the pros
perity or put tlie United States lack near
half a century.",
A few evenings ago this fubjedt being
warmly canvafled in a society of sen
sible men of different countries, and
(then) of different ways of thinking, I was
much entertained and not a little improved
by the difcaffion ; some American gentle
men being present, one of them proposed in
the true mercantile stile of exchange, orprojit
and loss reasoning, to explain his sentiments
by arithmetical rules of demonstration, that
is, by account current, the formation' of
which gave rife to some very amusing
and friendly fort of difbutes, for fitting down
with pen, ink and paper, he began a very
formal statement by debt and credit, to give
you a just idea of which I have procured a
copy, to which explanatory notes are affix
ed, by which the prevailing opinions &c.
can be seen, whicfy I hope will divert you
as much as it has

Philadelphia, December 18, 1797; _)

New-Theatre,
Dtcember n, 1797.
THE Managers particularly request the con
currence of the public in the abolition of a
custom, which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at the
Theatre.
They are aware that gentlemen are unconfeions
of any wrong done to t.ie interest of thc institu
tion by this pra&icc, from a general, though mis
taken idea that Checks arc the representatives of a
right to so many feats in tie Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will;
when in faft, they were never intended as more
than tokens by which the Door-keepers are enabled
to afcettaia with the lead trouble to the parties, that
they ibemfelvet have heen before in the i'heatre, or
paid for their admidion.
Independent of the injury the Managers sustain,
such a prsftice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other disorderly perfoni. to surround the doors of
the Theatre, to the surruption of their moral* and
the great annoyance of the Audience.
It has also been the source of two evils of no in
considerable magnitude; one is, that fomctimes
very improper company is by these mÂ«ens admit
ted ; and the other, that owa { to Checks palling
into dilhonell hands, they have been frequenaly
coonterfeited to a large amount for the purpofesof
Sale
This statement will, it is refpcSfully hoped, in
duce the PubSc to discourage such a traffic : and
the exertions of the Managers will, if thus assisted,
easily prove adequate to its entire abolition
