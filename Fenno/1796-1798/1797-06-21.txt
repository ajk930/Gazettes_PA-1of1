SUBSCRIBER having been appointed bV
the Envoy Extraordinary and Miniiter Pltui"
potentiary of his Britannic Majcfly, General sgeut
for aflifting British creditors, and such particular a
gents as they may specially authorize, in prosecuting
theyr claims before the cammiflioners for carrying in
to effeft the sixth article ot the Treaty of Amity, Com
merce and Navigation between his Britannic /â¢ ajefty and
the United States of America, hereby gives notice that *
he has opened his office at his feoufe the south east
corner of Chefnut and fifth streets, Philadelphia, â¢
where he is ready to receive all claims or initiuftioos
for claims with the vouchers aud documents thereof*
for the purpose of bringing forward the fame agree
ably so the rules and orders which the board may
think proper to prescribe.
And as it will be for the interest of all coneerntfd,
that the several claims be so Hated, and fupport
td, as to prevent the delay which would arise from
the neceflity of obtaining further information, or ad
ditional materials,from persons residing at a distance,
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (tor the
dire&ion chiefly of tbofc, who, not having employ -
ed particular agents, may leave the prosecution of
their claims to his charge and management) that ali
such claims ought in particular to fct forthâ
lft. The proper defcrip.ion and fitnation of the
creditor or claimant, end original debtor, refpeÂ£t

'by the provision, operation or defett of law, the
decisions and pra&ice of courts, or reilraint of exe
cution, frc-m recovering payment of the debt in .
quell ion.
4th- The loss ?nd damage, incurred dr foflained,
in confcquence of such impediments, whether the
fame may have arisen from the infolveney, change of
fituatton, or dead*.of the debtor, the loss of legal
remedy from laple of time, or other causes impairing
the value ar:d security of the debt, which would not
have so operated ff such impediments had notexifled*
And sth The par/tcular grounds ; end reasons on
which the claimant main ams, in the terms of the
treaty, that " by the ordinary course ps judicial pro
logs, the creditor cannot now obtain and a&ually
have and receive full and adequate compenfption" fÂ©r
the lofles and damages lofudaiued.
The general agent thinks it his duty further to fug
gefl that the f verai claims ought to be accompanied
and supported by the affidavits of the claimants duly
sworn and regularly atiefted, both as to the exrftence
of the debts claimed, and such other circumfbncea

- Mill jiw mi credit my sensations ar; not lehalive.
-But it is not my duty to dw'eli on those fer.f ionsâ
Much as I regret the caufesof the war, and the ci
bmitits with which it ha 3 bcei attended ; much
I regret the manner in which the hope of a spee
dy termtua*ion hai beeliobftruwfed, and additional
expences thereby incurred; much as I rrgret in
ereafmg expences, where exuonces have been so
much,. lr.d almost irrfufferably increased ; and
whatever iriay be my own perional mortification
artd regret in. being obliged to tome forward at
fa si a' diflrefsfijl period with n?w burthens; I feel
it, iNHiviiitiianding, to ,be my firll great duty to
eoiiie forward, as I hope and tmft tile House and
tountry will do viith me, with a firm and manly
fjiirit, to convince the enemy that however great
' rr ;y be our prefl'ure, however embarralfed our cir
rjni!h.ncti, we are determined to contend with
theni as long as we are able, rather than submit to
haughty and difhonouraMe terms. Thoufrh ws
may not lie fuccefsful cnought to accomplish the
mean* by which we can ternrinate the fatal poiiteft
in which we are engaged, conliftently with the ho
nour ferurity, andp.rmanent and effsntiai intereiis
of the nation, Itr us yet convince our enemies, that
cur spLit docs not def'ert us in our trials, but that,
infpite Â»f every difficulty, we will fl.iltlÂ»ejufV both
to ourselves and to our country. In this sentiment
I trufi to meet the sense of the House and the peo
ple ar Urge, whose patriotism, justice, and mag
nanimity, as they never have failed in the mofl ar
durut conflicts, wit] not, I trutt, fail now; but
nianifcll on the contrary, that whatever may be
the event, they have but one duty to pursue, the
fafcty honour and happiness of the kingdom.
Without heGta'tion, though certainly not. without
Irvxiefy,and regret, 1 shall now proceed to submit
to the Committee what I have to propose. Jn do
i'vj thi% it if with pleaiure I declare., that I fliall
cot only derive great advantage, but that my la
lour is materially diroinifhed also by the able
u:id impartial (latements of the firll Report of the
. Selecl Committee of Finance, which has been
printed and this day laid before you. However,
is pa; ti.uhr parts, I may be jufiified in differing
from these statements, however favourable those
ftotennnts may be to the general wilfces of the
HoCfe and of the Country (and I am ready to con
fefsthey are more favourable than what 1 have to
propose,) I stall juide myfrlf by their rfirecuon,
and render that .Report the bafia of the plan of my
propnfal. I shall follow the usual mode of prt
ceeding apon fubjeds of this nature, and firft take
a view of the tranfa&iocs which have caused the el
fences which we are how .called on to provide,
and state what fÂ»ms remain to he (rovided for ; I
fbafl tlrentsmpare these ptovifional'demands with
whathavc been already provided for in the cotirfe
fcf tha-prefent year, and submit the plans which I
propose for a further provision, and in this process
I lhall he as (hurt and explicit, as I can. For this
purpose, therefore, and according to the' tifual
prailice, 1 shall firft call the attention of the House
to the whole amount As services lor the preient
year, with the amount of th? fumj already voted
for defraying them, and tke amount of the sums
remaining to be voted ; after that I shall detail the
Ways and Means by which these services have al
ready been defrayed, and by which the remainder
may be defrayed; and finally I shall if at" the fpe
tific meafurcs which I mean to ground upon those
ftaKmects towards the provision for the accumu
lated interest and charges. For the fake of being
clear Arid intet'igible, I shall proceed article by ar
tide, under various heads; and, to puVue the euf
tornary mode, I if.ail of fourfe begin with the
Navy.
The Committee will recollet, that for the
Naval service of the current year, there has
already been voted the sum of 7,66i,0001.
in addition to which the Committee of Sup
ply has voted 5,c00,0001. more. Gentle
men will please to recoiled, that although I
estimated expences of the Naval De
partment at 7,661 .ocol. I then stated my
intention to propose the provision of a fur
ther sum of 2,500,0001. in order to remedy
an inconvenience which heretofore had ari
sen, and thereby have 10,161,9001. in cash
towards defraying any excess of Navy debt.
Such, however, have been the extraordinary
exertions and expences of the war, that
there yet remaftied an unfunded debt of the
Navy unprovided for, to the amount of 4
millions. In the statements of the Seleft
Committee a compartfon has been given be
tween this outstanding Navy debt and the
outstanding Navy debt in 1783, and the
Committee has made ail allowance for three
million, tn the Select Committee it ap
pears by the best, estimates, that as far as
they can be ascertained, the expences for the
Navy service would amount to 12,900,0001.
which is short of what I have stated thera
to fee, bat exceeding what I formerly confi
dertd them. By way of reducing this
amount, though I ought to state that a sum
of Boo,oooJ. went in aid of the Navy fervi--
ces of 1796, and consequently left the pro
vision for the services of 1797 deficient in
that sum, foi"! however, careful we may be,
a part of the expences will be carried on in
Navy bills, tbo' certainly to less extent than
formerly. In the provision of 12,000,000,
four (hillings per month would be carried to
the ordinary expences of the Navy, where
by about 110,000k would be taken away
from the unfunded debt. As I suppose
there will then be a million, or a million and
1' half of Nav}- debt afloat. Such was my
former statement, and compared with the
ftatesnent of the Committee, there is this
difference, that it fuppofe# i,st>o/3cof. of
floating Navy debt, inflead of ;Â»,ooo,aocl.
as lhÂ« Seleft Committee of Finance has
calculated. Ido not know whether I have
expressed myfelf clearly Â»pon this poir.t, but
if. not, I /hall be hippy ta give ir.y geaiic
man a further explanation.
- r â Army.
'l iic ne.it hnJ of i<jÂ» vice u the Army,
uppn which there has been alrsadv voted
the sum of 10,913,0001, The-aecounts for
f'reign corps arc no*, yet made out, but
they soon will be, and I have reason to hope
their expences will ba less than were caku
c lated in my original statement, and less than
, they appeared to the Seleft Committee. I
have reason to think this diminution will
amount to one Jialf ; and that tha sum of
370,0001. will be fuffieient ; 6,000,0001.
lt was the total amount for the army
it eftaWifliment, independent of the extraordi
n naricj, whicji is left; by 297,000!. than the
0 eftijnatw for the ensuing year by the Seledt
Committee. In 1796 there were.fame ex
it traoidmary expeuces of the army incurred,
_ which at present remain unprovided for, to
to the.amount of 3,287,0001. and in the in
- terval of the Bth December and the ift of
ll January, there was another out-standing <ie
â¢ mancT made evident of ioo,oool. which, in
J consequence of not being paid, is to be ad
ded to the other, and makes a sum ofâ
- 3,387,0001. out-standing army debt to be
provided for. It appears by the report of '
\ the Scleft Committee, moreover, that Trea
sury bills paid at the bank, and warrants for
army service due and unpaid, a further sum
â ' of 2,08i,0001. remains to be provided for,
j inasmuch as Treasury bills paid at the bank
_ previous to the jth of January 1797, and
, those which were due on the Bth of Janua
-1 ry,but not included, amounted to 1,660,000
1 to which were to be added 428,0001. for ar- I
j_ my warrants. So that the sum total would
, be as before stated 2,088,0001. The efti
-1 mated sum to be incurred by the army ex
r traordinarics for 1797, according to the re
port of the Secret Committee, and for the
amount of which it is my intention to pro
vide is 4,000,0001. It was not proposed
before Chriftmaa to raise any sum of money â 
for this head of service, but so far as any i
calculat ion to thelateft possible period could â 
be made, the calculation nearly tallied with \
that sum. It is here to be observed, that
the extraordinaries of the army are now, for J
the iirft time, brought forward by way of
estimate, at least they were never done so ful- "
ly till the present war, but they were paid
out of the money granted for other fervi- :
ces, leaving the provision for those services" â 
e deficient to another year. In addition to !
e this, there has been advanced to the Empe- J
ror, by way of loan, and which will be-due <
to the public i,200,0001. and a sum of,
900,0001. advanced to the merchants of ;
Grenada and Saint Vincents, which will al- 1
so be returned. There are further advances,
to the Emperor to be set ag'ainit the expence
of extraordinaries to a very large amount,
fr.r which it will not be neceflary to provide
a present fund, though I set them down, as
so much credit against so much debt. The
Treafui'y bills and Army warrants at home,
did not go to the extent of 2,088,0001. but
there were bills from remote parts, notwith
standing the precautions I had taken to cal
culate and curtail the expences abrqad as
much as pofiible, which exceeded what was
formerly thought upon estimate to bi their
I utmost amount. This might in part be
t owing to the unforefeen and incalculable
: operations of the war; however, I did not
think it consistent to leave them to reft on )
distant means of payment, and I chose ac-
I cordingly to propose for their provision.
This comprises all under the head of the
army. . â 
Ordnance. ,
' I now come to th# ordnance departments,
for which there has been already voted the
sum of and to which I do not
mean to propose any addition. I mult ob
serve, however, that since the estimates were '
' made, a demand of 300,0001. to pay deben- :
tures for stores supplied and services per- !
formed, has since come in for part of the j
ordnance expences in the fame manner as :
the treasury bills of i,600,0001. of which .
I did npt then know. To this deficiency
may be added another in the barrack de- !
partment, in which an outstanding debt re- ;
â  mains, not merely for the building of bar- >
â  racks, but for the expences of provision and '
accomodation, in which the soldiers would
have been furniihed to the amount of the â 
fame charge upon the public if they had
been garrisoned in barricks,. but had been i
quartered elsewhere. I mention this to re
â¢ move any prejudice which might perhaps '
have otherwise been indulged, and (hall con- j
elude this article by.recortmending the pro- â¢
vision advised by the Seleft Committee of,
717,0c01. which in the present view of this \
fubjedt will defray the whole demands. I
have now proceeded through the Navy, Ar- <
my, and Ordnance, in which Ido not re- 1
â  colled to have omitted any extraordinary
items, exe*pt that I have not mentioned a
fpecific additional sum, which I mean to
propose for. the further relief of his Impe- â¢
rial Majesty in the present critical period,
1 and the particular statement of which I have
reserved to a separate difcufiion. As early j
as practicable, tliat fubjeft shall be submitted J
1 to the consideration of the Committee ; but '
â  however important it may appear, it is not !
expedient with my arrangement to enter on
it at present.
Mifccllaneous Service.
â¢ the next branch of the supplies is for de
-1 fraying the expences of what is called the
1 Mitcellarvpus Service, which includes the
1 expences of Plantations, Convicts, &c.â
1 For .this there has been already votÂ«* the
, furo of 378,0001. and if I proceed by the
1 estimates of the Seleft Committee, a further
sum of 929,0001. will be found neceflary..
In this-fum 400,?0c1..is comprifcd forma- .
' king provision beforehand for articles it lias
been usual to pay in the firft instance out of
the. Civil Lift, aad to propose afterwards to
Parliament to vote a sum fufficient-to repay

statement, I have rrot included the provifi
-05 of any sum which the important domes- '
tic happiness of the Royal Family, and the
accustomed fertir.gs of the-country have al
lowed S3 the tifual pprtion with any qf the

fpeclfic proportion, There. is, tiowever, a
sum of 6 50,00c1. ineiuded,. .which is propo
se d to be lent to the fafferug Grenada mer
chants over and above the funis which I have
before stated, and which are to be ultimately
repaid ; but- I took occasion to. include
them in my statement of the achul expen
diture, because they are sums for which I find
neceflar-y to provide a temporary provifiori.
Natioral Debt.
The next article o" supply is the annual
prrtvition- for the discharge of the National
Debt of 200,000.
D.fi?i.w:':cs of Land and AT.il/.
To this 13 to be added, the'ufual provifi
ori made for the deficiency of the prcjduce
of the taxes upon Laud and Malt, to the
amouut of 363,0001.
Repayments to th: Bani.
1,054,0001. is to be provided to repay
the Bank for advances upon the growing
produce of the Consolidated Fund for 1796 ,
and paid also by the Bank.
Further deficiencies of Land and Mall.
I /hall propose a further provision ofâ
-900,0001. to meet the deficiencies 0/ Land
j and Malt not included in the estimate, but
which I think may probably arise.
Navy and Exchcqutr Bills. \
The next sum is i,n0,0001. voted in
the Committee of Supply, for the discharge
of Navy and Exchequer Bills, raised by an
Aft of last Session, upon a Vote of Credit in
1796. The House will recolleft, that a
provision was made for funding Navy and
i Exchequer Bills, and relieving the Market
of so much qutftanding debt. There was a
party who did not choose to avail themselves
of the liberty of funding the Bills they hold,
and this sum was to make good their de
mands. ~
Consolidated Fund.
The next is a sum of 2,177,0001. to
make good 3,500, cool, charged lay.an aft
1 of last fefKou on the growing produce of
the consolidated Fund, for the service of the
â  year 1796. 3,500,00 c!. was the sum grant
ed and thought applicable, but various cir
j eumftances had operated to its disappoint
ment. Exchecquer bills advanced to the
I Merchants of Grenada and St. Vincent's,
| in consequence of the .misfortunes in those
. Colonies were paid in again ; a loss was fus
â¢ tained in the produft both of the new and
1 old taxes, by the stoppage of our distilleries,
; the defalcation of which sums was not made
J good in the year, and to this was to be ad
j;.ded the payment of bounties to seamen, by
I tHe Receivers of the cuftomsout ofthepro
| duce.oF that year's revenue, which caused a
defalcatiori in the produce of-the cuitoms ;
and lastly. the bounties upon the importati
on of Corn. These circumstances of course
would not make the whole deficiencies good,
and leave the consolidated fund applicable to
the service of 1797 ; arid as I cannot sup
pose that the Committee would choose to
; have those sums charged like a mortgage on
the consolidated fund, I have provided for
its relief, and taken them as an article of
supply from the sth April 1796 to tfce sth
April 1797.
l r ote of credit and Loan to the Emperor.
There is only one other sum which re
mains to be stated, and that is a vote-os cre
dit to the amount of 3,000,0061. As
I 500,0001. has already been advanced to the
Emperor, I wish, if it meets with the ap
probation of Parliament, to be provided with
a further sum of 2,500,0001. in order to make
further advances, if approved of, as the
time and exigencies may require. I state
this in order to let the committee know the
ultimate amount of what sums it ma*e ne
ceflary to provide at the fame time I desire
to have it understood, that I do not mean to
pledge any person to a final vote upon fur
i ther advances to the Emperor, unless for a
t certain sum to a limited extent, which I (hall
i state before I fit down. Supposing this
vote of credit to take place, however, or
not,, I shall state that as part of the sum to
a. limited extent, which I deem absolutely
neceflary at this critical period, to allow the
Emperor to fulfill his engagements, toge
ther with myreafons forit. I have now gone
' through the whole, of the supply, all the de
mands for which it was not "possible to cal
: culate before Christmas, and throughout my
ftatemepts of them I have afted on the re
-1 port of the Seleft Committee. In so exlen
iive a statement it is impossible for me to
hope that I have proceeded so clearly as not
sometimes scarcely to have made myfelf. un
derstood ; but if any gentleman un
der any difficulty, I shall request him only
to follow me throughthe veryable statements
of the report, andl believe he will find our ac
counts tally lo nearly in the estimated fervi- '
ces and outstanding arrears* as to fliew the
fulleft confirmation of the acscuracy of my
statements. For the fake of beirig more ex
plicit however, I shall sum up all the heads
of the supply in a

Mr. Pitt computed the sum total at

i oivs in his computation, and .at otlirv tt'ines
! did not punftually-adhere t<> the statements

which we have nnde a careful corHpariioj,
we trust the public will not, impute atly
blame to our fidelity for aay Vv.ry apparent
' ignorance or error,
j - IVays and Mentis.
j Now, Sir, in regard to, thÂ£ Ways and
Means for providiiig these Sqpplies, I mast
beg leave to state, that a fum'a little "lets'
than seven millions will cover th,e
because a repayment of fame of the advances
' may taice place in the ccurie of the year; I,
500,000!. ariling from the Taxes"on the
Land and Malt, will be paysble by Ofto
ber, and Exchequer Bills to the amount of
j i,6q0,00g1. will repay the Tijejfury Bills
. in the fame sum paid at the Bijnk.
My next duty, in the meag .time, is'to
1 state with what ways and means 1 am pro
, vided to meet the various sums of this largÂ«
amount. 111 order to do that, I.shall begin
with the laud and malt already voted, which
according to the usual calculation is reck
oned at 2,750,000!. The surplus- of grants
already voted,- and the loan by.
voluntary, Subscriptions, 18,000,0001. mak
ing a sum total of 21,1.7.0,0001. These are
the only sums already voted towards-dctray
ing the expences of the year, but there were
other sums stated in the original statement,
of which the firft was a lottery. The lot
tery has varied in the general statement, but
taken according to the usual profit, it pro
duces somewhere about 200,0001. By ex
chequer bills in the former statement, I took
credit for 5,500,0001. which is the usual a
mount of exchequer bills kept afloatbut
I do not now think it prudent to rely ypon
an iflue of exchequer bills to that amount on
account of the recent embarraflments in
public credit. I shall not reckon therefore
on a larger ifTne than 3,000,0001. which is
less than the quantity now in circulation; I
shall take the surplus of the growing pro
duce of the consolidated fund on a new esti
mate, on account of the charges on it, and,
shall therefore take credit for a moderate
sum to be derived from that source. This
moderation does not rife from any diminu
tion of the permanent taxes, because the
report of the feleft committee on finance
confirms my repeated afTertions of the flou
rifhing state of the permanent revenue ; nor
does it rife from any considerable disappoint
ment from the produce of new taxes, be
cause, upon a review of the new taxes levied
in 1793, '794> 1 79 Si ar, d the best esti
mates of the probable amount of the new
taxes for 1796, when any supposition is en
tertained that they will not be able in their
ultimate amount to maintain themselves at
the produce at which they were computed,
by Jetting them againfHhe loans since raised, '
and operating one again'fl the other to a ge- ;
neral dimiihition, it will be found that they j
go near to counterbalance any deficiency, '
and are nearly equal to-the charge upon the
consolidated fund by' providing the interest '
of the funded debt. But it is to be .reqol- J
lefted, that although ift laying taxes I take I
credit for an amount which cannot be so !
productive as I may have calculated, I have i
generally endeavored soon enough, to meet j
the increaftd charge, arid prevent an aecu- j
muhition of unfunded debt. I -now stand!
with the knowledge of two quarters, freed
from a mortgage of 1,075,0001. and higher
in theij l computation than I was juftified to
make thefer. As heavy asray computation
might be, however, ! have the. fatisfaftion
to hope, the total of the supply. may recur
before the taxes of next year, though "al
lowanos must be taken for both confedera
tions. Every estimate is liable to uncer
tainty, but the average of the permanent
taxes upon 4 years I find to be 13,919,000,
to which adding duties of 1796, I shall have
a total sum of 17,803,0001. I am aware
of the allowance on wine, from the flock i*
hand, but in looking at the produce of the
sum total of the permanent taxes, and look
ing forward to distant periods when frefh
sums will become due, I have a right to as
sume that to be the amount ; for when we
cease to take account of the flock on hand,
the annual consumption will replace the de
ficiency. The taxes imposed for 1797,
were reckoned at 2,106,0001. Part of those
taxes, it is true, are yet under consideration,
but, many will take place at an early period.
I do not suppose, therefore, that I shall be
taking the benefit of the estimate at too
mudh, if upon the whole I value them at
1,500,0001. To this is to be added the
! further amount of 600,0001. which I fup
j pose to be the nett profit of the taxes which
I*l am about to propose, and the advantage

another' question which is neceffarity involv
ed in the present fubjefl, fajit which, as it is
to be a matter of diftinft discussion, I will
not enter into at present. I Ciall barely
mention the circumltance. The nature and
terms of the lad loan, which I submitted to
this house, mutt naturally be in the recollec
tion of molt gentlemen, I will, on a future
day, put it to the confiderdtion of the houfc,
how far the fubferibers to that loan (liould
have been losers in consequence of the great
discount upon it. That will appear mote
clearly from the circumstances attending the
present unexpected loan. It will certainly
be neceiTary for thi house to adopt some mea
sures. which Ihallmake up the losses to those
gentlemen, who, in a moment so crSJcal,
came forward and displayed their patriotilrn
and loyalty, by contributing so largely to
the exigencies of the country. In consid
ering the amount of the new faxes which I
have thought it necessary to lay before the
committee, I have made no estimate of those
which were created before Christmas, in the
last budget, because in so short a time ail
accurate estimate could not be taken : and
I have therefore supposed in my present cal
culation that they will be as produ&ive as I
then stated at the* opening of that budget.
New Taxes.
I now proceed (laid Mr. Pitt) to enter upon
that tiÂ»plea'fant task which falls rÂ« my lot, ,of
propofmgto thecpmmitteethegeneraleutlines of
such sources of taxation, is have appiared to
me least objeftionabie,and best calculated to pro
ducejthe means of meeting all the difficulties of
our present situation. The Committee mutt
| not suppose that there catj.be any taxes whate
ver which will not be liable to many objections ;
, but I triift that when th?y consider the necessity
I as raising taxes to a certain amoiint, and of pro
! vidivig for unavoidable expenccs, they will agree
j with me that those which flull appear to fall
; tnoft lightly upon all descriptions of people,
| ought to be cfiafen in prefernce to any others'.
; 1 hope that.wKle the Committee meet the pro
t poGtions Miave to make with a firm determing
j tion to difculs them, they will also consider that
I it ought to be their jirft nbjeA-to obtain eftW)u
ja I taxes. Among the different branches which
form, the objects of taxation in this courier",
j there is one great source of productive rercnile
! exteiifive iri. its operation, not preffipg on any
particular â¢delVription of psi fors, aridÂ°l t a(t of
ail iipOn Uie lower orders ofyeoplc, a mode of
taxation, winch is fafe and expeditious in the'
mode os-collecting it, and what is lliil we
advantage. H~,,'will not require any additional
expeiice either with 1 efpect so' hew officer, ââ
increase of. fahry to those already emploj ed in
performing ttat part of the-public service.
Otis fourte of revenue is the general branch of
the Stamp Duties, which for *h& last 15 ypars
has b*en rapidly increasing ; arid has been do-.i
bled since the last war. My genera! ofejedt in
laying additional duties on this, va'.t branch of
revenue, ts to make a diltiiictionbetwen diHerent
artieles, some of which I shall tax in a greatT
proportion than others while fame are to be ex
empted altogether. The greatest addition is to
be laid on thole which go under the general del
nomination oi Consolidated Duties. These
are of that deicription, where "stamps of the
fame-, denomination hive been applied general!*
to different kinds of jnftrumems. They include
a variety of articles; The principal of these
relate to the transfer of property, to deeds, ad
judicatiocs, and proceedings in the eeclefiaftical
vourts'. My objeA, &s I have juftobferved, is
to fee what augmentation tuay take place by le
yymg atax on thewholemafs of{|arrps. But it
is my intention to exempt from the general tax
all inftriimentsthat relate' fo law proceedings in
courts of jullice. I know that an opinion has
prevailed, andi witji Tome degree of jtoftice, that
by taxing articles of this dffenptton, and by
that means ericreafiiig thcexpcnce? of hw fuiti,

OIK wjtich fall equally light on all deCcrip
. tiors of peopie ; it has been Hated to me that
the ."iithcr.rlcited topxesof deeds which are kept
ihdifferent offit'tj never have any (lamp upon
-tlie-n, and that it is only the orirfiral deed which
ii stamped ; 1 shall therefore propole that
there lliotild be 00 copy of this kind without
a ft amp equal to that of the original ; and
the duties producedby this regulation would
amcunt to the sum of 40,0001, The fourth
aititle which I mean to propose as a fubjeft
of taxation, relates to the Prebates of Wills,
all of which, except those for sums under
3001. I shall move to pay a certain duty,
which may produce the fund of 40,0001. â
'I he next lubjeA I have to offer to the com
mittee, is One which will produce a great
deal of difcufiion 6ut of this house. It re
lates to a certain species of property well
known in this country ; but it will be the
v-liicle (and that not a verbal one) of con
veying to the different parts of the country,
what I am now Hating. When Iconfiderthe
great pre valenee of this vehicle ofgeneral intel
ligence ; when I consider the amazing extent
to which it has been carried ; that the lux
ury of it has been so very generally felt and
â  pra&iicd ; that the taste of the Public is not
'likely to be shaken, by any trifling encrcafe
111 the price of an article fought after with
such universal avidity ; when I consider al
so the immense profits produced by these ar
ticles of luxtiry, which are of a nature fhat
Ought not to exempt them from their share
of general taxation, I conceive that the lay
ing on an additional duty on . ne-wfpapers. it a
meafpre that cannot be in any manner objec
tionable. This might be donewithout any in
juryeitherto theeditorsorthe authors of such i
publications. Theprefentduty is 2d on each
paper ; in addition to which I should pro- 1
pose a further tax of one penny halfpenny ; ;
and even in that cafe, considerable gains
will be produced to the proprietors of pa
pers. I should conceive that the price to
customers ought not to be raised any higher
than this additional duty ; because on a for
mer occasion, in confequen.ee of an encreaf
edduty otr. paper, the price of newspapers
were raised far beyond that proportion, and
has continued so ever since' < therefore I do
not imagine the proprietors of them can
now hive any equitable claim to an encreafe
in their price. The sum produced by this
duty oil! amount to H4,0c01. The next ;
thinj; I have to propose, is a modification of
the duties on advertisements publifhpd in news
papers, According to the regulations that ;
exist at prpfent, there is no difference in the
duty upon an advertisement of three lines
and that on one <jf the greatell extent. I
i should propose to vary the present mode,
and according to the regulations whieh I
shall offer, there may be advertisements the
duty on which shall amount only to some
fhillingsj while on others the duty shall rife
up to some pounds flerling. The eitimated
produce from this source will amount to
ao,oool. The next duty I have to propose
ii to arise from a regulation of the fiamps on
attornies certificate/, by which certain frauds
that have hitherto been praftifed may be
prevented. This will produce the sum of
15,0c01. There is one more article of lux
ury which I shall propose to lay a tax on ;
that is, all plate that Jhall be manufactured
forth.' purpnfe of ornamental.use, which will
produce the sum of 30,0e01.-' All those
taxes which I -have just now enumerated,
seem to rae-to press as lightly on the gene
raftjulk of the people as any I could think
of; and leaf! of all to increase the nationul
difficulties. There still remains one more
to be added. I have endeavored to find
one, which, although I corifcfs it is not free
from some speculative and practical objec
' tionj, \yill not however be found inconve
nient to the public at large. It is'a fubjeft
which haÂ« often been thought of before
HiiÂ« time ; which has been once before this
hptifc but Was withdrawn. This is a tax on
carriages of all forts, and tan gOods of all
kipcts coivÂ«ye4 by carriages w"hich pass
through tiirnpUe-gater, whefe the la"X"iÂ« to
. operate by air mcteafe of the tolls. To
illic it-will be right to tViake some eximp
Â«<r tifkM i fuilf as exemption? on all new tolls
â¢ : Vny they shall have rifcn to a certain amount
' A-:tferie'jal;Â«<rcptions provided- for by gene
-\4lawÂ£Tr-an<j localesceptionÂ»in certain di
, _ . The lm>e-cxceptio?s that now pre
vail in tolls alfo tO prevail on tjie part
! Â»of the pUfilic ; and I should propose that
n- theftnx- dutj maybe taken for the publics,
ttSt is how paid for tolls. I .cannot exactly
fay how much thii vri'j prodtuie; but T
know tjiat w'vKti it was brought forward
hereabout 15 years-ago, it was CltimateU
; it fio WÂ« afum than between 4 and jco,'oco
- pounds. With rÂ«fpeft to the piinciple of
' this tax, it may be to <jii the ground
of its being a-great hardiuip-bo tay a bur
tlten on pajjengers and -U>e conveyance of
good.); but I hope â when gen tit men \rill
confidrr how final! a portion mull fall to
well individual, that they will not look
upon this is a grievance, But rather as a
I,'anAer of listen ing thej?cncf4 burthens.
f J have now listed every thing whieh I con
ceived material in-aa conciiie a manner Is I
could ; and t return my thanks to thrcorc
mittee fjt tl.e indulgence they have ftiewn |
;nc_during the length of time I have trcf- ]
pafied on their attention. I -have no other j
exenfe to make- than that I am pleading.j
the ncccffity of dwelling oil a subject whi.-h
T did not wish.to brii)g'forward.immediately.
â¢ âAnd I nÂ»w submit this pleasing oJrcutn
llance to the confidcration- of the House,
that in the midst of difficulties-, - and appa
rently surrounded by calamities, we have
fliL been able to find such ample rtfources,
as those which have been stated to them this
day. I call upon thefn to reflect, that at
the moment when we are struggling with a
great cocteftâwhile we are laboring under
prefTures as heavy as they are unexampled;
we still fee the itrength and powers which
we poflefs ; and that if we are not to be a
larmed at imaginary evils ; if we are not to
be dispirited by events which are not so ca
lamitous in themselves as they have been
conceived to be ; we shall find the radical
wealth and the ample means of this country
fully fufficient to support us in every con
juncture of c>ur affairs, and ultimately to
restore us to that situation from which we
have been removed for a time, by circum
stances as extraordinary as they have been
unavoidable.' He then concluded by mov
ing resolutions founded on his flatements.

A major de Bert is a principal in the tlan

A SUBSCRIBER.
On Thursday tafl arrived at Cockfpur, a
Virginia built brig, formerly called the Matil
da, at present under Spanijh colours, mounting
16 guns 4 and 6 pounders, with 102 men ;
lajl from St. Thomas', commanded by Tho
mas IVhippo, whose general character is well
known in the middle andfouthern Jlates as well
as feme parts of Europe. 'Unfortunately for
our national character, he once claimed the
right of a citizen of New-York by birth.
Capt. IVhippo arrived dt this port late in
the month of December lafl, iif the fbip Com
merce of New-Tori, from 'Baltimore ; here
he made a kind of sale of the ship, to Capt.
John Green of Alexandria, who loaded her
for the. Wtfl-Indies. To avoid the fraternul
embrace of the fheriffi, or some of his deputies,
and to dfappo'int his creditors, Capt. IVhippo's
friends gave out that he had embarked iu the
barque Albany, for Europe, and from that
time he. became invisible to the public. When
the Commerce was ready for failing, he left \
this city by moon light, and proceeded in her to
St. Croix, where Jhe was again fold,
this virtuous American proceeded to St. Tho
mas', and purchafecl the brig above mentioned,
and has come hither with the laudable intention
of capturing American property.

The bill puffi-d 43 to 26.
Mr. W. Smith, from the committee of ways
and means, reported a bill laying a Â«iuty 011 licen
ces foi the fate of wines by retail, and also foreign
diflilled spirits, which twice toad, and commit
ted to a committee of the whole on Thursday.
The house then resolved itfelf into a committee
of the whole on the bill tor railing an additional
torps of artillery ; when
Mr. 8. Smith took, a pretty eitenfivc view of the
fubjeet, aid noticing the men reported to be Ra
tioned at different places, infifttd upon there being
a fulticient number at every one, except at Wil
Â®mingt<iiÂ», N. Carolina. Hewilhcd the deficiency
in the prelcnt ri-Â£imrnt to be filled up, and then
there might be a supply sent to Rhode-Island, and
any other place where they might be required.
Mr. Giles moved to ftiiae out the firftfedtion of
the bill. He thought the 300,000 dollars pro
poled to be expended on this objeft might be bet
ter of in another way.
Mr. W. .Smith hoped the present motion would
tiot prevail, as it was intended to destroy the bill,
fie thought tbe Prciident and Secretary of War
having recommended the measure, and one branch
of the legillature having pafled s law upon the
fubjed, thty ought nut to defeat the b:.finefe in this
way. He was fwjirifcdthc gentleman from Ma
ryland fr.cuM have been so decidedly opposed to it,
since thi other day he feeined undetermined on
the fubjeift. Hrhadtafcen a view of tlic different
polls, and declared them all well garrisoned, but
he had taken no notice of places where thtre was
hot a single mail. Mr. S. said it Ihould be reinem
bered that in the men calculated to be at each place,
were included non-conmidioned officers and rfin
fid; dripped of these, htfmade the whole number
â¢jybmen. The polls at which no nien were Ha
tion:<l'K!*e, he said, Portland in Maine, Ports
m->utli, N. H GlÂ«Ueefter, Salem, Newport, R.I
New Lo"do*i, and Po nt Petre at Savaniuh.
The report ol the Secretary ol War, Mr S no
ticed, had repr fttited these placet as to de
cay for want-os eing keut in repair. He noticed
leir.e abjefiioh-, I'rgeci ajjainft th srn:afure on a for
mer day. He denied that this could !>c called the
fcleton of a ri::ini nt; it was nearly complete, as
nejr as it (ffuld well he. None of the artillery on
the frontier eculd be fafely drawn away. Our fi
lu-itiou ih're was critical; and tu take any men
away, whilst the Spaniards were lscieafing their
force, would operate to our disadvantage in the
.minds of ihe Indians. Mr. S. denied that,the ex
pence would be so Â£reat as had been said. Our Ti
tration, he faid,'was neither pence nor war, but a
fort of intermediate lUte, which waÂ« far from
hieing fafe, and wh ch required tiiem to prepare tor
war. If gentlemen had not been of this-opinion,
why incretfe our naval armamuit ? He thought
they com radioed themlolves. He charged ths
gentleman from Maryland with having fcr/ot the
raprcf ntation he bad given on a fornier occalion
with refpeft to the fttuation ef the fortifications
at Baltimore, which he then said was not fufficient
to keep off the ctius. (Mti S. Smith said iie ip '-ke
only of the want of a fence). This measure had
been charged with being an increase of oÂ»ir peaca
! eftablilhnv rft and that die bill being for five years
countenanced this idea He denied that this was
the cafe, and if the period were thought too ionjj,
it might be Ihortened. Gentlemen had also said,
that advaatage wts taken of the impuife of ths
moment to pais this bill. But by what, he siked,
had this unpulfe been occafioaed, but from an id a
of the danger of a war? And he thought the
fears of the nation ought to be calmed, by taking
such measures as the present.
When an increase of the navy was under con
federation, Mr. S. said, g#ntlemen exclaimed, leave
trade to tal:e careol itfelf, and let us attei.d to the
internal defence of the country; but now, when
they were preparing fir that, the faille men fay we
are about te employ upon this obje& what ought tu
be employed for theproteiSion of commerce Mr.
S. laid it was an error to fay no tares would be
wanted, if this bill did not paTs. There would be
money i i that cafe wanting' for manning the fii
gates, for arming the revenue cutters, for the di
plomatic department, and for the expellees of this
feflion (not ltfs than 60 or 70,000 dollars)
would he needed for the lafl item only for the pay
siant of the agents appointed for afjfting to car
ry into cffeift the 6th article of the Britilh treaty,
&c So that that that argument had no weight. It
was said these men were unneceflary, because the
militia were the proper defence; but-the Prefi icnt
had not the power to call out the militia, except in
cases of infurre&ion or invaGon, so that an enemy
might get poffefiion of the polls before the militia
'were called out.
Mr. S. concluded by faying there were about. 33
forts on the sea coast, and that these men ditlributed
among them would only give 14 to each, which
would r.ot be fufficient to preserve the guns from
rufl ; and, if this bill palled, there would only be
41 for each fort. He submitted it to the commit
tee, therefore, whether they ought to rilk the fafcty
of the country for the fake of 316,000, dollars.
He trulled they would not.
Mr. Shepard opposed the motien. He thought
it necelTary men fliould be sent to thofc forts
where there were none,tÂ» prevent them from go
ing to ruin. Inflead of the number proposed to
be raised, he tho't two companies wou'd be fuffi
cient. He did not think the country in a fafc state,
Â»nd wi(hÂ«d to make it in some degree more so.
Mr. Baldwin observed, that since the
adoption of the federal government, the his
tory of the military eftablilhment had, in his
judgment, been the molt expensive and un
fortunate part of its hiltory. It had com
monly been so of all nations. He thought
there was every inducement, from the ex
perience of ourselves and others, to make as
sparing a use of it as possible. The reasons
hitherto afligned for a military eftablilhment,
in this country, have been a supposed un
friendly difpoiition in foreign nations, and of
the vast Indian tribes who bordered on our
frontiers. These had been for fcveral years
the cause of great anxiety and expenee ; they i
were all now happily removed by treaties of
peace lately established. It was his opinion,
that on that event there was little or no cause
left for any military establishment at all. He
had been one of a committee last year who
recommended a reduftion of them, particu
larly a total reduction of the cavalry : this
recommendation did not fully prevail, but
his opinion was still the fame. The reasons
now urged for regular troops mult be con
sidered principally of' a permanent .nature#
and for a peace establishment; the enlistment
now proposed is for five yearsâhe hoped it
would not prevail; he hoped the establish
ment would not be carried to any greater
extent at this time. More money and mere
troops was apt to be an increasing paflion,
â¢always attending large delegations of power;
colleft money to raise armies, and raise ar
mies to collect money, has been a wheel of
fortune to theffi, and a wheel of rack to their
fubjetts. He 'hoped this country would
form an exception, and fliew that some of
the miseries of the world were not the in
separable condition of man. It was the
profefled objeft and principle of our revo
lution } none of its friends can advocate a
.standing army. The fpecinl reasons urged
of their being necelTary to keep peace with
the Indian nations on the frontiers, or for
the forts on "the sea coast, he thought had
not great force ; the numbeV or extent of
the forts is not to be encreafed ; in a finilh
ed State they would require fewer troops to
man them. There had always been a fron
tier, and large nations of Indians bordering
upon it ever lince the firft settlement of the
country ; there is therefore nothing new in
our situation in that respect, to urge it more
than formerly ; Aat there (hould be Â£ome
confufion and disorder from that cause, had
always appeared unavoidable, but regular
troops had not been found by experience to
be the most ready or molt ufeful relief. He
believed things mull go on pretty much as
they had, and that eftablilhing the civil go
vernment was all that could be done in the
cafe. He thought the fifty companies now
in service would be fufficient for all purpo
ses, and that the new regiment now propo
sed woidd not be necessary.
Mr. Williams thought the report which
they had received from the war-office . did not
go far enough. Eef.des the artillery, we had
four battalions of infantry, which mujl be some
where in garrison. He thought the present
number of artillery was fufficient, being the
fame at in 1J94, efftciaHy since artilirry nei
tier ereUed forts nor kept them in repair,
â¢wifhedthe 122 deficient jgicn to Le raised, and
fentto Georgia, and places crfl of blew-Tori,
Indeed, it would appear extraordinary, if,
after voting IJ 0,0 00 (hilars for fortificationsÂ»
tb.y Jlould vjti'j at leaf! 250,000 for men to,
tdhe care of them, tic did hot think it â¢would
le prudent at phef nt to go into the meafurei
fine? be did nit believe any danger tvas noiu to
be apprehended, arid as they did not knoiu
â¢where the money -was to-come from. Â£te did
not wish to go on increq/ing the utebe, and hi
few I'ttle chance of raising frejh. revenue.â
iVe had at present, he said, a greater propor
tion of artillery, than ahy ocher nat'tbn ; hav
ing 16 compauiet (f artillery to Si of infant
ry. If more troops nt.'r; tiecejpiry, let such be
raised as vfoilUbe tnofl vfefiil. They held re
ceived a bill from the Senate for raifiog a pro
â¢oiftonal army, tuber that came before them, ht
\fhould give it his note.
