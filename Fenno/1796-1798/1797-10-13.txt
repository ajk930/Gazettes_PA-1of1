And each might a member be, J
And come if he'd a mind to.
And now they mingle white and black,
And hug and kiss, protest and chat ?

All Sprung from them, the reptilei.

Made for mean staves, not frecboj'n cits i

As fprmig from mean allegiince ;
And hftly, these fame cÃHaing elves,
Shunning the light, purblind tlietnfi^lve!,
Voted the fun a grievance.
Marching in his merid'an height,
Arrayed in royal robes of light,
Pouring through planetary femes,
Jk-r.evolence from all his beams,
Difpeufing heat, light, life and food.
On rarth, in air, and ptopled flood,

The little rage of demo pride,
Then fmil'd contempt on their ill nature,
As Adams smiles with dignity,
At an infusing French decree,
Or blackguard piece in Bache's paper. t
Thus fmil'd the felar president,
As through the ecliptic states he went,

Come forth, and view ray cheerful

Come view aloft, each grovling foul,
Where my united planet) roll;
Count, if you can, one single star.
From nearest Mars to Herfehell far ;
Whose light, whose heat, and influence dread,
Springs not from me their federal head ,
Then view this joyous eaYth, which seems
To turn rejoicing in ipy beams ;
Then view this land which gave you birth,

See where the broad Atlantic laves
Your fliores with riches on its waves ;
From where the hardy sonÂ» of Maine

See commerce ply her feathering oars,
Her t road fails whiten all your lheres :

See latfghing labour deck your fields,
While buxom health revives the plain,
Flushes each cheek, swells every vein ;

TO THE PUBLIC
Apprehensions having arisen in the hreafl of
the Steward, that illicit praSices were, carried
on at the City Hospital, under his care, diligent
attention tvas paid night and day, in trder to
bring to conviSion the parties concerned, and
yejterday morning at half pajl one o'clock, one
of the nurses was taken by the Steward, with a
bag full offundries belonging to the public. On
a promise of forgivnefs to him, confe/Jion was
made of property to a considerable amount, being
lodged in the house of John Brmjn (another of
the nurses), 7he clerk at a very early
rode to town, and obtained a Search IVarrant
from alderman Jennings, when the fail was
immediately proved, and Br'own committed to
the city prison by the said alderman. This
fortunately exonerates the others employed in the
public service, and muflprove a particular fatis
faction to the Steward and every other attendant.
Matthew Brown, conjlable, is entitled to thanks
for the readiness in which he ajftjled the clerk in
obtaining back the property, and at a place where
others might have objected to attend.

BENJAMIN CHEW, Chair.
Samuex-W. Fisher, Sec'j-y-
From an Ehglijh Paper.
The French revolution, which commenc
ed by fire and affaflination, has been pro
longed through torrents of blood, and by
the means of pillage ; from the murders of
M. Foulon and Berthier in Ju'y 1789, there
is no one epoch of this astonishing revolution
which has sot been stained by blood, or
marked by the most atrocious crimes. But
the periods of deferve observa
tion, because tney present very diftindive
and striking features.
The firft maflacres and conflagrations
were direfted by the members of the left
fide of the constituent aflembly : but as the
people were not then fufficiently prepared
to behold their attempts against persons and
property with unconcern, the constitution
alists were obliged to counterfeit the king's
orders, to encourage their satellites to {laugh
ter the most faithful fubjefts of the monarch,
and burn down their castles. The conven
tion, fucceflora of these firft constitutional
monsters, paving brought the people to be
lieve, that murder and affafliuation were ap
pendages of its sovereignty, organized tri
bunals of blood, which publicly ordered its
.effufion in the name of the law. Thus, it
may be said of France, enslaved by modern
Neroes, what Tacitus said of Rome, under
the empire of Tiberius : " th3t after hav
ing at firft groaned under the enormous
crimes of its tyrant, it experienced a new
degree of villainy, still more dreadful, by the
fangu'inary laws made to maintain him on
his bloody throne, at que antebac Jlagitiis, ita
nunc legibus laborabatur."
The best blood of France was filed in the
beginning by the .firft revolutionists, Who
raised the standard of revolt apainft their
*heir Goil : "But loon were tW~
poinards turtioJ themselves. When
Barnave said in the constituent aflembly,
that the blood of Foulon and Berthier was
not fufficiently pure to be flopped from flow
ing ; when a duke pursued his queen at the
head of a horde of aflaflins, in the night be
tween the sth and 6th of Oftober, 1789 ;
when an Orleans caused the duchess of Lam
bolle to be cut in morsels, and even viewed
the ceremony from the window of his hotel,
that he might succeed to her estate ; when
Lameth pillaged the hotel of the duke de
t aft res, and insulted the august princess who
had drawn his family from obfeurity ; when
Condoreet plotted the maflacre of the duke
de la Rochefoucault, his benefaftor, in Nor
mandy ; finally, when Petion, Briflbt, Gor
fas, and many others organized revolt, and
prepared the people by means of their jour
nals and by virulent declamation, to demand
the blood of the best of kings, and the'moft
unfortunate of queens ; these detestable
men did not forefee that they themselves
would soon beprofcribed by the fame sov
ereign people whom they so basely flatter
ed ; and that they would in theiy turns fall
a facrifice to the poinards with which they
armed the aflaflins and murderers against their
princes, the nobility, and the clergy.
At the firft period of the Revolution, af
faflination was fubjefted to the appearance
of forms; M. de Favras was condemned by
the Chatelet of Paris. The'judge did not
every where aft in a similar manner â¢, sever
al viftims were saved from execution by the
conscience of some of their magistrates, in
whom honor was not altogether ex tingu fil
ing. But when murder was changed to
carnage, insomuch that the tribunals could
not spare time for so many formalities, nor
the common hangmen for so many execu
tions ; a more expeditious method became
neceflary, and it was adopted for the scenes
of August and September, 1792. The
Executioner being asked, how many persons
he could expedite per day, answered 400.
The number was too fVna.ll; and it was then
that Danton, Robespierre, Manuel, and
their crew, determined to arm all their satel
lites, who, in the space of two days, mafla
crfcd about 4000 priest*, nobles, or other
persons attached to royalty, in Paris.
When the Girondins, who then ruled in
the Legislative Aflembly pafled to the order
of the day upon the denunciation made to
them of these maflacres, tbey little expefted
that they authorised a conduft to which
they themselves would become viftims the
enfuingyear. It was in vain for tjrem to
exclaim against the murderous faftion of the
2d of September, for these scenes of horror
sprang from those of the 10th of August,
which BrifTot, and his friends plotted in
their midnight conventicles at Chareiiton.
What will become of those ferocious men,
whose bloody sceptre seems now about to
reduce unhappy France to the Condition of
an immense house of slaughter? Can we fuj>-
pose that divine justice will suspend its aven
ging hand, before these monsters shall be
buried in the fame tombf-into which so ma
ny viftims have buen precipitated; forae in
nocent, and others more or less No
âit is conformable to the eternal judgment
#f Heaven, that his arm shall be uplifted
until the land shall be cleared of the mon
sters who have deluged it in blood, mafla
cre, and rapine; Other faftiens, equally a
trocious, will arise, the members of which de
ft roying one another, will rid the earth of
the monsters who pollute and ravage it.

CARLISLE (Penn.) Oftober 4.

William Breden of York county ; Tho
mas Greer, James Graham, and James

ihem to a future conduft answerable to the
education they had received, and to the ex

a generous public, and be patronized by all
who wifli well to the cause of science, and
the true interefls of the state.
> NORFOLK, Oftober 7.
DiedâOn Wednesday night, after a
short illness, Louis Etienne Duhail,
Vice-Consul French Republic at this
place, and lately ot Baltimore. He was
horn at La Mans, in France ; had formerly
been admitted a doftor in phyfie in the U
niversity of Caen in Normandy ; he lived for
many years at Paris, where he was known
among the Literati, not only as-author of
several poetical works, but also as well con
versant in biography. Being at the head of
the board of foreign affairs in the stormy
times of the new government, he became
acquainted with diplomatic agencies-";- and
shortly after his arrival in this country, was
admitted a member of the Philosophical So
ciety of Philadelphia ; he was a man of
great circumfpeftion, apparent coldness-, and
restrained intercourse ; but on a closer ac
quaintance, he discovered deep knowledge,
mildness, and moderation of mind, a'iid es
pecially an uqblemifhed impartiality, that
made him loved and regretted by all his
countrymen. His rsmains were on Thurf
dayattended to the Catholic buryiiig-grotind,
attended by the Britifli and Spanish consuls,
and a number of Frenchmen and inhabitants
of the.borougb.
Yeflerday, Mrs. Ann Gow.
PARIS, Aug. 6.
It appears certain that gen. Hoche has font in his
resignation to the diredory, but that it has not
been accepted.
We have every reason to think that the report
of the rcfumption of hostilities ir^ Italy, between
the Republican and Auflrian troops, is entirely
withcut fpunda;ioh. In our opinion there is flill
every proipetfl fcf peace with the house of Auflria,
notwithstanding the negotiations are at this time
so much protradled-
The very moderate conclusions, ihthe report
made yesterday to the council of five hundred by
â¢the comtuiflion of itifpefters, relative to themirch
of the troops, havÂ« surprised many perfont, who
expedled to hear that a proposition would be made
for a decree of accu&tion agairift the three mem
bers who compose the majority of the directory.
These perfops have been altogether"mistaken, and
perhaps will be so for a long time to come.'
We cannot be too much on our guard againil the
croakers (pcurcux) who augment the mifchief by
their violent and unceasing exaggerations, and who,
if we were to liOen'to them, would hurry us in-
Hantly into a civil war on pretext of lleeringclear
of it. They call on us to fly to arms, without
giving theralelves the trouble to enquire whether
we are provided with the nccefTary weiyons, and
without pointing out to their friends where they
are to find them in cafe of emergency. Wretched
will-thofe be who shall allow theinfelvss to he di
r .-Sed by filch guides, who ihudder at the phan
to-ns their own imagination has formed, and who

LETTER from Mr. PICKERING,
' Secretary of Slate, to the' Chevalier DE
2~R UJO, Envoy Extraordinary and Mi

jejly to the United States of America.
DEPARTMENT OF S'TATE.
Philadelphia, August Bth, 1797.
Sir,
I duly received your letter of the 11 th
of the last month, to which my other en
gagements have till this time prevented an
annvir.
My additional report to the President of
the United States, on the 3d of July, in
relation to Spanish affairs, has offended you,
and is mentioned as the cause of your writ
jngto me on the 11 th. If, fir, I were now
to make the just remarks and recriminations
which your letter obviotifly suggests, I am
afraid you would be still more offended. I
am not stir? indeed, that I can possibly frame
an answer that will escape your displeasure ;
but I shall endeavour that it be expressed not
in a flyle indecorous, unusual, and i/nbe
coming a diplomatic correspondence, while
it contains a fair exposition of fafts and ar
guments, in opposition to errors and aftual
irfifneprefentations.
In refpeft to your fufpieions of an expe
dition preparing oh the lakes by the British,
for an attack upon Upper Louisiana, 1 have
laid that you never mentioned a single faft
or reason on which your fufpieions were
founded. In contrafliftion to this afTertion,
you fay that " In our conference on the
27th of February, you gave me informa
tiÂ«n that a corps of 350 men had been
raised at Montreal, and marched towards
the lakes, where, after the evacuation of
the American posts, there was no ostensible
objeft for them:" â" That you knew
that the British agents had treated with
forpe of the Indian nations in that country,
concerning, the intended expedition ; and
that you added, that you had received those
advices from a person who might be de
pended on, who had seen these new levies
parting through Johnstown on their way to
the westward." To this, fir, I answer,
that I have not the flighted rccolleftion
that you mentioned' either of these eircum
ftanees ; âthat the Secretary of War hap
pened to come into my office while we were
conÂ»erfing, at which you expressed your
fatisfaftion, and repeated your fufpieions,
âand he fays you then mentioned no faft
or reason as the ground thereof; and that
when I mentioned the fubjeft to the Presi
dent, certainly within ten or twelve days
after this conference, I perfeftly remember
making to him this remarkâThat in your
letter of March 2d, you said you had three
days before declared to me the just rba
sons you had for fufpefting that the En
yglifh were preparing the expedition in ques
tion ; whereas you had offered me no reason
at all. Hence I am obliged to conclude
that you might have held such a conversa
tion with some other person, and by mistake
have applied it to me.âThe Englilh iaifing
350 menâmarching them through Johnf
town âand with the Indians to
promote the expeditionâwere eircumftanees
which appeared perfeftly fiew to me when
I received your letter of the 1 ith inft. I re
member also, that the tonference ended by
your faying you would write to me on the.,
fubjeft ; which evidently implied that your
written reprefentution was to be the basis
of any aft of mine, or of the government.
In that letter, fir, if you pofTefTcd any
grounds for your fufpieions, you ought to
have dated them. For, contrary to the
opinion you have now expressed, I have no
hefitationin fayingthatthegovernmentof the
United States was not bound to take notice
of the vague and unsupported fufpieions of
any minister; at least not to ineur expense,
by its military arrangements, to prevent 6n
imaginary expedition,' such as was the ob
jeft ofÂ«yours. When you made a formal
ftatemeut of your fufpieions, but without
any faft to (hew that they were founded ;
when the government of the United States
pofieffed no other information, nor the
knowledge of rniy eircumftanees indicative
of the expedition ; Â£.nd when in itfelf it ap
peared destitute of even the shadow of pro
bability ; it was an aft of complaisance to
a fill re you that it " would be anxious to
maintain the rights of their neutral situation,
and on all occasions adopt and pursue those
menfures which should appear proper and
expedient for that end." What these tnea-.
fuivo should be, and when to be taken, the
government itfelf would judge.
It was an aft of still grcate* complai
sance, when on the 21ft of April you re
newed the declaration of your fufpieions,
hut Jlill without ajftgrdng any reasons, for the
government to refolveon, and to communi
cate to you, what you are pleased to allow
to be a " determinate disposition on this
point."
In the next sentence (as in many others)
you misrepresent my expressions and misun
derstand my meaning. Ido not fay, that
" from your not having given me detailed
information refpefting the expedition, and
from the answer which I received from the
British minister on the 19th of June, I be
lieved the expedition to be groundless."
But after remarking that you never mention
ed a single fa ft or resfon to support your
suspiciousâl fay, " From all the bxis
ting circumstances I ever believed the
fufpicfon to be groundless." If proofs had
existed, you would have produced them;
for although intrigues and conspiracies
for the military expedition may
loÃg be concealed; yet the preparations
for an expedition (and such you
were making) must.be vifibleto many; espe
cially " on the lakes," here every movement
for such a design wduld be unusual, and
therefore attraft the more attention; and
fatisfaftory proofs of such preparations
would have been attainable: but you pro
duced none.
Another material circumstance I mull no
ticeâThat troops of the United States
were stationed at Niagara, on the Miami,
at Detroit and Michilimackinack; and con
sequently in fituatfons well calculated to pro
test oar territory, as well as" to discover and
get information of, any warlike preparations
so considerable as such an expedition would
require; and the officers commanding on
those stations could not have failed to com
municate such discoveries or information to
the Deparrment ps Wan yet no such com
munications were made.
But it was also well known that they had
not on the lakes a force adequate to the en
terprize in question. .1 considered also the
great difficulties that would attend the trans
portation of troops, equipage, provisions,
cannon, snd (tores, by eithei; of the routes
fuggeftedâ,if either could have been taken
without violating the territory of the Uni
ted States.
These when? eircumftanees abundantly
fufficient to discredit nakedfufpicion; and the
declaration of Mr. Liilon, in the note of
the 19th of June, was mentioned, only as
confirming the juftpefs of the opinion which
which I had at firft formed in March, and
which I continued to entertain of your sus
picious. I might add, that at that early
period, Mr. Lifton aflured me that he had
no knowledge of such an expedition; and
his inquiries of the governor-general of C n
ada and the British secretary of state, have,
enabled him positively to assert, in the.a
bove note, that no such expedition was ever
intended. And this faft repels your fng
geftions that I had been " remiss" in not
doing for two months, what, on my own
principles, was proper to have been done.
Buj! you think I ought not to have commu
nicated your fufpieions of this expedition
to the British minister, although " his mo
tions were to be watehed." You think, on
the contrary that the President should have
given suitable orders to General Wilkinfon
or to the commanding officer of the military
force "on those frontiers: but have kept a
perfeft silence towards the Britishâhave let
them complete their preparations (if anyhad
been making) and colleft their army on the
lakesâhave let them move forward, until
they should enter npon the territory of the
United States : and feeing the President
could not know before-h tnd, whether they
wonld prosecute their march by " Fox river ;
and Ouifconfion, or the Tllonois,'' we may
suppose your ideas of the " suitable orders" j
to the military to beâthat at a great ex- '
pence the troops of the United States should
be drawn into that country and divided into
corps, to be posted on those rivers, to have
fought the British army, and thus have de
feated their enterprize. Sir, this is not the
only instance in which, after having desired
the American government to do some aft
intsrefting to your own, you have then pre
furoed to diftate how it should be done.
" But (you fay) you never could have
imagined that I would have giveu to the
British minister a piece of advice, which
might enable him to alter his plan, by let
ting hrni know that th* former one was<lif
eovered." And what, fir, was the plan of
, the British to drfeat which you desired the
American government to interfere ? Why,
according to your fufpieions, it was to
MARCH AN' ARMY THRCfUGH THE TERRI
TORY OF THE UNITED STATES AGAINST
upper Louisiana. If then the commu
nication of your fufpieions to Mr. Lifton
would induce him " to alter his plan"âit
would by a word or a letter, instead of an
army, defeat the expedition *; for it was not
possible it should go forward except thro*
the territory of the United States ; and con
sequently the communication, instead of dif- ;
appointing, would have perfeftly accom- j
plifhed what you requested.
In your sth paragraph you are pleased to ,
mention what you consider as another o
mission of duty. That although on the 2d
of March you wrote your fufpieions, and
three days you mentioned them ver- '
bally, yet offne 9th, I had not laid the mat
ter before the President. I will take the'
trouble to (how with how little reason you j
have made this remark. The 2d Â«f "March
was the day next prefceding the dilfolution â¢
of Congress ; and at the close of a session
the President is overwhelmed with business j
that cannot On the 3d the ;
then President's term of office expired. On
the 4th the inauguration of the succeeding
President was celebrated. The sth of t
March was Sunday. The five following I
days were not unoccupied ', and on the I ith
of March the answer to your letter of the
2d was given. And although you attach'
so much importance to your fufpieions, the
details I have given prove that they were
then - destitute of probabilityâthat they
wore in faft unfounded : and consequently
of no importance ; that as such I then justly
considered them ; and therefore needed no
'â¢ very powerful" motive to remain fiient
five days.
I cannot but regret that my reasoning is
so often not understood. When reciting mv
inquiry whether the pods occupied by the
troops of Spain within the territory of the
United States had been evacuated; aud
your answer, that not having for some
months heard from the Baron Caronde'a,
you " were deprived of any information
touching the steps taken fcr the execution
of the treaty"âl put these last words be
ween inverted comrnns, not as yon fay, " in
order to draw attention"âbut because they
were an exact quotation from the tranflatiou
of your letter. And when I added, in my
report, " nevertheless he (the minifler of
his Catholic roajefty) fiy inform
ed the Baron de Carondelet of hiVfufpicions
of a projected expedition from Canada 5"
it was net to prove either that the Baron
had received your letters, or that you had
received his : but as that very information
wasafiignedbv the Baron asavj-eafon for dill re
taining and reinforcingthepofts,theobvious
conclufijon was that you wrote and transmitted
to him the information with that view : aiii
Hence, that instead of disclaiming all know
ledge on the fubjeft, candour should Have !
induced you to answer me, that although
you had not received any late letters from
the Baron, and therefore jfou could not fay
what steps had aftually been taken for the
evacuation qf the posts, yet that on account
of the fufpefted expedition from the lakes,
of which you had informed the Baron, you
pfefumed (or you advised, and probably you
did advise) that he would still hold polfefT
ion of them "to cover Louisiana." This
" logic," lir, I hope is intelligible ; and at
any rate, not " extremely falfe."
I cannot omit noticing your obfervafions
on the sth paragraph of my report. If, as
you were obliging enough to promise, you
had favored me with copies of the Baron de
Carondelet's two letters (of which you ui)- I
dertook to give me an Â«>ral but literal tranfla
ticm) instead of their Â« fubftAiice," I might j
have:J>c<ni more-carreft in reciting his asser
tionâThat Mr. .Ellicot had not given him
notice of his arrival at the Natchez as the
commiflioner of the United States for run
ning the boundary line. Whether this was
a complaint, or an " observation," as â¦ju
choose to call it, every reader of your letter
will fee to be of no consequence. But whe
ther the aflertion was founded or unfound
ed, was material ; feeing, in the fame letter,
Mr. Ellicot is charged with having " carried
his zeal so far as to attempt to get pofTeflion
of the.Natchez by surprize and an afler
tion follows, that " Governor Gayofo fays
he has in his power documeats which prove
evidently the intention of this attempt."-r-
This accusation against Mr. Ellicot I con
sidered as injurious, not to him only but the
government ; for which in the charafter of
commiflioner he was appointed to aft. If
other circum fiances. induced me to doubt
its correftn'fs, the other complaint or " ob
servation," which I knew to be unfounded,
could not but increase my doubts. It was
important, therefore, and my duty, to pre
sent them together to the Prafident's notice.
I have not " entirely mistaken" this matter.
In my report to the President, I did not
undertake to recite what you " mentioned,"
but what you translated from the Baron de
Carondelet's letters : you repeated the
charge in question ; and it was not till then
I handed you the copies of the Baron's and
Mr. Ellicott's correspondence (hewing the
repugnance of faft to aflertion ; and it was
then that you blushed ; as I had before been
astonished. And your remark, afterwards,
was what I have dated in my report, " That
you supposed the Baron did not consider j
Mr. Ellicott's letter as official." Youthen !
made no diltinftion between a complaint
and.an " observation," nor used the phrase
" in the rigour," nor any other qualifying
wordi ; except those which are stated in mp
report.
Befide6, the baron had no right to
expeft any other evidence of Mr. Ellicott's
appointment than his letter,until they should
meet for the purpose of commencing the
business of their appointments \ when of
cOurse they would mutually exhibit their
commiflions. And from the baron's answer
of the Ift of March, it is plain that he ex
pefted no-other notice : ferAe therein re
cognizes Mr. Ellicott as the commiflioner of
j the United States.,
j x ln the last sentence of-your paragraph on
this fubjeft you fay, " That when after a
mixed and desultory conversation upon va
rions fubjefts, you had collected and metho
dized your ideas, and committed them to
writing, my-anfwer and obfervatioris ought
to have been confined to the written com
munication.""âThis observation, fir, is in
accurate.
It may, however, be applied *to a former
part of your letter. You fay that in our
conference on the 17 th of February, you
mentioned to me the raising of 350 men at
Montrealâthat your informer saw them pass
through Johnftown âand that you knew
theÃritifhagentshad treated with some of the
Indian natiopsconcerning an expedition pre
papingonthe lakes. But iu your letter of the
2d of March, in which
left and methodize your ideas" on the fub
jeft of your suspicions, you do not introduce
one of those suspicions : of course, on your
own principles,l ought,if they ever had been
mentioned, to have considered them as nul
lities.
I In the Bth paragraph of your letter, you
: observe that my proof obtained from Mr.
Ellicott's messengers, that he did not at
tempt to get poflefllon flf the Natchez fort
Iby surprize, is merely negative. I offered
it only as such. But the negative testimo
ny of two meu of good characters against a
faft yvhich they were likely to be acquainted
with, .if it exified, and whose existence other
circumstances rendered improbable, and the
aflertion of which isrpingled u ,th afTertions,
by the fame perfbn, of other faÂ£ts, of which
some, or even one, is known to be unfound
ed, merits confederation. There is, how
ever, further evidence applicable to this cafe.
In the letter dated at the Natchez the'jtli j
ot May, from lieutenant. Pope to governor i
Gayofo, you will fee-that the governor hnd
made the like accusation against' the lieute
nant. " A gentleman had informed him
(the governor) that the lieateftant intended
to attack the garrison at that place." Lieu
tenant Pope, jullly hurt by the groundless
aflertion, (lefires the informer may be named,
and required to acquit himfclf of his afler
tion, or be punifhod'as a falfeacenfer. The
governor answers the next day,âspeaks of
the information as communicated to lieute
nant Pope in familiar conversation; and adds,
that the informer was to bedefpifed. Yet,
from the pointed manner in which lie tenant
P<>pe made the demand, it is evident that
the information was presented to him as a
serious accusation. After this detail, will
it not be conjeftured, thai the governor's
" documents" refpefting Mr. Ellicott's
" attempt" are of a piece with his, " fami
liar conversation" with lieutenant Pope con
cerning his " intended attadjk ?"

long. 65, 35, W. was boarded by a French
privateer brig, From Guadalonpe, under Eng
li(h colours. The particulars of the treat
ment which capt. D. received, is thus re
corded by him. " The capt. of the priva
teer came on board, with five of his crew,
and demaaded my papers,; after examinati
on, ordered all my trunks and chests to be
opened, and topk from them all the money
they contained, with the letters, which,, he
opened 5 he tiaok all our stock, and cahin
stores, with all the spare running rigginga,
fails and blocks, and cut one studding-sail
from the yard ; he also took one caflv of
rum, belonging to the cargo, and a cafe that
bilpnged to capt. Haynes, who wa-i to have
come paflenger, contents unknown. Af
ter plundering us of the above articles, he
fuffered his people to rob us of what they
pleased ; and so fully devoted were they to
the bufmefs of thieving, that they took eve
ry article they could find, even to the knives,
forks, spoons and tumblers, and in fad e
very article remaining in the cabin.âHe
then put two seamen on board, that were
taken a few days before from the brig Fav
orite, SifTon, of Baltimore, master, and
Mr. Taylor, supercargo, with a cargo of
50,000 dollars. The capt. of the privateer
wished to put capt. SifTon and Mr. Taylor
on board my vessel ; but they infilled on
Haying aboard the privateer, and demanded
to know the fate of their property, which
spirited behaviour produced on the com
mander of the privateer, a condudl, unwor
thy a man, for pn their refufal to quit the
privateer, he inhumanely flogged them
Besides capt. Siflbn, there were feyeral other
American mailers and seamen on board the
names except one, not to be as
certained, this individual's name was .John
Barnes, of Marblchead :âA few hours pre
vious to our being boarded, the privateer
took a sloop from Rhode-Jfland, captain
Briggs, bound to Cape Francois, who he
said was a good prize. To add insult to
our misfortune, this inhuman pirate threat
ened to take me on board his and in
fljdl an ignominious, -puniflimcnt on me ; and
fitiifhed his brutal behaviour by difmifling
me, with a curse on my country, and a de
clared determination to rob every American
veflel he could not make a prize of."
