SPEECH
OF MkRLIN, AT HIS INSTALMENT AS ON Â£
OF THE DIRBCTORSjTO H ISCO L LE AGU E6.
â¢' Citizen l)\r:Sors,
" In the moment in which I am to
take a share in your labours, a thousand con
fufed fefitiments aiife in my wind : in or
dinary eircumftances the duties which I am
called on to exeeute are so important of them- .
selves, that it is difficult to think of thqm
without uneafiiefs. What then mtift be my
alarm, when I consider them in all the addi
tional fplendpur wliiuh you have added to
thsm.
" Flattery can, without doubt, never ap
proach the circle of, the directory ; but
when truth does you honour, he who is to be
your colleague ought to be fuffered to
I'penk it.
"In the firft moments of your high ad
ministration you found the republic in the
molt deplorable situation :âlts financial re
sources appeared entirely txhaufted ; a pa
per without any value represented the pub
lic fortune ; all the arms of induftiy were
bound ; all the channels of commerce block
ed up : some powers had been detached
from the coalition, but it still wore a for
midable appearance, and 'fcemed to have
made up, by extraordinary efforts, for the
loss of some of its leading members. Civil
war raged in the departments of the east ;
i and, io the interior, the public spirit, grad
-1 ually debased, threatened republican inftitu
. tions with almost certain ruin ; the enemies
, of the people were become their magistrates ;
: the sword of national justice had given way
. to the poniard of revenge ; the laws were
i impotent, and their organs mute ; emigrant
rebels, and men condemned to death, had
r aftually taken theii feats in the senate ; the
- emigrants reigned in the republic, and the
r republicans were forced to emigrate.
t l " Things were in this situation when you
took on your hands the leins of authority,
is and fee what is their present situation.
Commerce has resumed its aftivity, induflry
Q is again animated, and the earth has given
i- up the treasures which midruft hid buried
le in it. Abundance every where prevails in
ft our cities ; the arts again smile at their re
r- generation ; civil is extinguished ; on
ft the Rhine, on the Adige, on the banks of
i_ Oglio, our triumphant armies have every
to. where -carried with them vi&ory, and victo
n- ry has di&ated peace to the expiring coali
tion ; the fruitful feeds of liberty have been,
ty scattered over the neighbouring countries,
d their reproduction and their multiplication
ns will be your work. You hare repressed the
ve faftious, and on comparing with our former
ie troubles, the situation in which we have Ur
ns ed for the two last years, every man who .
ry has a sense of justice, even though he has
;r , not subdued his prejudices'to his real inter
h- eft, is forced to do you homage, and to a
all gree, that you have terminated the revo
lt- lution.
ce " Your triumphs, however, citizens direc
all tors, your courage, the good which you
un have done,and that which youhave attempt
ad ed to do, have all of them been nearly ren
ice dered of no avail, by the attempts of the
be conspirators whom you have overturned.â
he Oh (hame ! oh infamy ! oh accumulated
e- baseness and meanness ! The friends of
ir, kings were become the legislator? of the re
le, public ; traitors weYe engaged in dtlibera
aid tions with you ; they would have fold the
ar . honor of their country, the {nterefts of the
th- state, and the blood of all patriots to a
es, ft ranger ; and liberty and the republic would
y's soon have been at an end ; but you were at
tnt your.posts, and liberty and the republic were
ch saved. 1
ire " rwmqrtal day of the 4th of September,
-If- you will be famous among the days of the
m- French revolution ; and it is to you that
as- the whole gfory of it belongs. What, with
er- out the a (Tift allce of .the executive riireftory
the fnd its faithful representatives, driven by
oc _ violence from the tribune, defame 4by ca
-515-, lumny, and impotent even by their virtue,
u s. what, I fay, what could good citizens do in
jng oppofitiontothofefanguinary and abominable
red laws* which forbade the most pacific meet-
H g- ings, which armed against them' infamous
or eut-throats, which recalled emigrants to eve
ge, ry P art France, which deprived the pur
thc chafers of national property of their inoft
ap- legitimate acquisitions ? The legislative bo
the dy is now become republiean ; laws are come
rJth to confolcj to secure, and to encourage citi
tedi zens ; difurder, 110 aft of violence lias d. -
ac h based your viftory ;it has b<-*n pure as your
ixig intentions ; the 4th of September might
m j t have been a day of battle, it has turned out
aol, a day of rejoicing.
t. to " Honour then is due to your wisdom
pon and your courage ; honour to the repvefen
fe - tatives of the mtion,. who have felt, that
and between your ccnfe and theirs there was no
tted difference ; and honour to you, the brave
ias companions of Buonaparte and of Hoche,
a tes Angereau, and Chejin, names dear to re
:on- publicans and to liberty ; and to ,yquÂ« i.i
faid trepid soldiers, so worthy of the chiefs who
rnce command you, and so worthy to obey tli'ejc ;

:ape virtuous ai.d proud people, you who (,ave
on, replied with so much wisdom find modera
, re _ tion to the vile calumnies of tii'ifetwfro were
any not worthy of knowing you ; you have
the ftewn yourselves calmly ttrong, and coolly
,p on confident of your power. Your eoctnirs
das have felt it : nor were you ever more terri.
? to ble to them than in that rnajeftic mcfr
and which left your energy to, be imagined,'and
aty. dispensed you from the neceflity of Iht\\.
that ing it
tas "To me, citizens directors, it. is highly
the honourable to have soon to embrace as ce'-
le in leagues those whom my country now hails
as its fayiours. It is too, particularly agree
" able to me, to recollcft the firft moments rn
â which together we brandilhed the firft nrn s
Tiber fÂ° r t^ie catife of liberty. Yes, from the firft
dawn of the revolution, while'one of ymi
nr. was laying the foundation by gcujrpt: f .crifices, and by a noble difintereftcdnefj for
the fate which was one day to call to
concur in the foundation of th: republic,and
to become one of its firfl; magistrates, I had
the honour of fitting with his two other col
leagues in that afTembly, which began so
much without aceomplifhing any thing ; and
with a ju!t degree of pride I fpealt it, the
people then considered lis as their firmed
friefie*:â-wc have juftified, and we will juf
tifv that opinion.
" Yes, citizens directors, I am prouS of
being joined to youâof being able to fee at
home those qualities wlvich diftSngtiilh vou
at magistrates ; ns ycur private virtues, that
mild philanthropy which culture of
fciencc and the simple tafl'e for nature, the
attendant on a lofty and sympathetic foul, in
one ; in another, that firmnefs of charaitef,
that rapidity of thought, thai unshaken ar
dor, which is never (lopped by obstacles,
and which fees in difficulties only the means
of glory and a source of triumphs ; and
sbroad, that brilliant coarage and those affa
ble manners which temper the exercise of
authority, and command attachment while
they ensure refpcft.
" What ffir.ll I fay to you, citizens diiec
tors, fcnd whtit can I bring into this society
of virtues and talents ! A zeal, industry, and
unbounded d votion, and constant efforts to
detcrve your efltem, by labouring, like you,
for the republic.
" Repub'ic ! May this facrcd nameâ
this nanu which ruffians have dared to tar
nish, become the objeft of universal esteem.
May it* institutions be honoredâMay it be
beloved by its children at it is feared by its
enemies ; mr.y the intimate union of its cbief
magiil'ratts, and their unanimous agreement
with ItgifUtors, bind still more strongly the
bonds which it has attempted to divide ; and
may the coalition of all means and of all ef
forts at length realize that vvi(h which is in
the bofvim of all good menâthat of the.
tranquillity of the republic within, and
peace with its external enemies, honorable,
solid, aril fiicb as the innumerable triumphs
which I fee on every fide of us, point out to
us to require.
" Full of these fentimcnts, and convinced
of the receflity of adding to the convidtion
wjiich you already rnuft feel of their finceriy,
the additional pledge of a solemn oath, which
is nothing to a rascal, but a religious duty
to an honcfl man ; and in order to prove my
inviolable submission to the laws of the re
public,
" 1 swear hatred to royalty and anarchy
and attachment nnd fidelity to the conftitu
tiois of the year."
Citizen Francois de Neufchateau then
said,
" CITIZEN DIRECTORS,
" After what citizen Merlin haa said, I
cduld only repeat expressions which I (hould
be fearful of weakening. Thtfe fentimcnts
have been in my heart since my firfl infancy.
Brought up in the school of philosophy, the
revolution' found me ready to embrace its.
dofkritie, and to maintain it. lam well con
vinced, that a citizen ought to live and die
for the republic, that he owes himfelf entire
ly and without reserve to it, and that it is
in tfce republic that we ought to plape and
consecrate, in some fort, all our wiflies and
all cur hopes. This profeffion of faith being
also yours, citizen direftors, I am happy in
partaking yoiir labors, as I entertain the
fartne ideas and have (hared the fame gangers.
It ir> a flattering circntnftance to me to find
here three diflinguifhed members of the con
stituent aflembly, and one of my colleagues
in the legislative aflembly, with whom I re
member to have run other dangers on the
icth of August, 1792. I am penetrated
BS"you are with this immutable principle (of
which the 4th of September affords a sub
lime application) that the best means of
maintaining a government and of rendering
it liable, is to bring it back constantly to
the principles 011 which it has been founded.,
It is therefoae neeeflary that France and its
government (hould conftanth^ return to re
publican principles.
" A witness of the purity of you inten
tions and of the greatness of your courage,
and admiring those virtues at this great con
jutl&urc, lam happy in the choice which
"eonftitutes me a member of the executive di
rectory, and which unites me intimately with
the favionrs of my country. It is with joy,
then, and from my heart, that I take before
you the oath of hatred to royalty and anar
chy, and of inviolable attachment to the re
public and of fidelity to the constitution of
the 3d year."
The president of the dire&ory replied to
them,
' 1 Â« Citizens Colleagues,
" is agreeable for me to be the organ
of the executive directory, to express to you
how happy they are to fee you among the
number of their members.
" They have at length pafled those days
of anguish in which mistrust and discord pre
vailed its our circle. The most agreeable
confidence is abo\it to prevail among us, or
rather already pievails, and nothing can dis
turb it. Whatever difference may be in our
pleasures snd in our habits, our harmony
will not be lqfs perfeft. We all know one
another, alid we arc all convinced that each
of in energetically wishes for v the republic,
and the cortftitntiou of the 3d year, which
is the pledge of it; that every one of us is
desirous of feeing virtne prevail, of infpinog
all hearts with the love of the country: that
1 very one of us, in (hort has no other ambi
tion than that of feeing France free and
happy within, and great and honourable
without,
"'May this affe&ing agreement serve as
, n example to all FrenchmenâMay all re
jublicans rally, and the lhades of opinion
l) 0 longer render them the sport of ariitocra
-y & fanaticifm âmay terrorism, which one
party affeft to fear, and which the other
would really render terrible, in order to drive
us into the arms of Royalty, no lodger serve
as a pretence tÂ» (top the progress of public
spirit may government meet with confi
dence, and the [French pfrfuade thcmfelve*
that this dreadful fyftera will never reviveâ
may those violent men, -.vhofe escefles cre
ated perhaps as many enemies to the revol
ution as the deftru&iori of abuses, be sensi
ble for onct\ that energy of foul, and vigor
of means are adverse both to oppreflion and
atrocity; while on the other hand, weak
and tinftid men may henceforth cease to cal
umniate decided republicafisâmay. they
know that wisdom is as far removed from
weakness and pusillanimity, as from exeefs
and cruelty ? in a word, may all parties u
nite themselves on truly patriotic principles,
by the principle of those who know how to
unite great wisdom of conduft with great
vigor of charafter, an ardent passion forjuf
tice, with an unbounded attachment to li
berty: an almost restless vigilant* forth#
support of the republic, with a great love
for peace; and a humanity and compafiion,
with the severity necessary to rep'refs v'ce
in general, and the enemies of liberty in
particular.
" It is by this agreement of all parties,
by their union with the friends of liberty,
vvhofe true charafler we hav# delineated,
and by the praftical effefls of their maxinas,
that we lhall fee the republic confÂ»lidated,
and the constitution of the third year
strengthened beyond the pofiibility of being
shaken.
" To this objeft all our wishes and all
our labours tend: and we never thought
our hopes better founded than since we have
known who were the afTociatcs, and whom
the wifdoin of the legiflativj body had cho
sen for us."
A new difcHat-ge of artillery announced
the installation of the new directors.
A meflapje was then sent to eaclv of the
councils, advising the-m of the installation Â»f
citizens Merlin and Francois (de Neufcha

PAIIS NOT TRANQUIL
The Chouans of Paris do not yet consi
der themfelvea as subdued : on the Sth of
September, they-infulted the citizens at
the Theatre of Moliere, but they prudently
despised their provocations. Yederday, at
a tavern, the representative Lehardi, who
took such an aftive part in bringing about
the revolution of the 4th, was threatened
and attacked by twoChouam, who behaved
so ill that he was obliged to seize one of
them by the tollar, in order to eofiduft hirn
before a justice of the peace. But his com
rade having taken flight, he succeeded in
extricating himfelf, and got off. If the
police do not take care, the cut-throats
under the command of Pichegru will soon
revenge their general in disgrace, by destroy
ing those men who have been the mod ac
tive in overthrowing royalty.âAnnales Po
