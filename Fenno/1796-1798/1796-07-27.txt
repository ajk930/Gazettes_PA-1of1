As 1 am only a Lay Preacher, it mud not be ex
peCted that I (hould always exhibit that accuracy
of sermonizing, which tharaCterises the fettled paf
\ tor. But having observed in the course of along
and regular attendance on public woriliip, that Di
vines are in the habit of dividing their matter, and
of adjourning sometimes the morning exhortations
till after dinner, 1 thought it expedient, when I se
leCted the fruitful theme of last week' 9 Qieditation,
to reserve pa" of its topics till now. For', during
the proeefs of critically examining my TubjeCt in all
lights, 1 found that fafiiion regulated speculation no
less than practice,and that opiiions, as wII as dreff
tt, had their times and seasons. As we are told by
a profound reafoncr, that ss tjierc is bu: one fun in
the natural, f > there can be but one truth in the in
tellectual world ; sn abdiaCt me*aphyfician, in his
cell, would suppose by this time, that one
truth was discovered, and hence necefTarily induc
ed uniformity of thinking. But this is a mere re
verie of a novice in the history of man. In theo
logy, in the healing art, in politics, in the fine arts,
and in polite literature, in whatever interrd*, in
whatever amuses our fpecirs, perpetual vicissitudes
occur, and what is supposed to be fettled by one par
ty at one time, is unhinged by different theories at
tnother.
In the infancy of the colony "it Plymouth, and
at the creCtion of the Saybrook platform, our emi
grant forefathers, rejected with loathing the fat lux
ury o! Luther, and ilarved themfclves on the mean
fare of Calvin. They were doubtful even of fc-rip
tural truth, if it had ifTued from the Clarendon
press, and could not read the fermoir on the mount
to edifisation, unlrfj imprinted in a bible at Gene
va. Willard's body of divinity was their law and
testimony, and rcpiobate was that sinner who would
adventure 'o read and practice a more gentle and
generous fyflem. But such heavy and clanking
fetters of the mind, were too iikfome to be long
worn patiently hy fretful sceptics; and infant Ca
tholicism in its cradle at'length ventured innovation.
Good works were sometimes afTociated with impli
cit faith, and the piety of our piimitive chridians
was not always horror If ruck at the union. In pro
eefs of time the reign of rigor declined, and now it
may be said the high prerngative of fuperltition has
become as nugatory as kingly power in France.
For, a new dictator in divinity, who knew not Cal
vin, arose, and Chauncy confiderfng brimdone. Kb a
Scotifh or an old wive's fable, pro laimed salvation
to all men, and infilled that a profligate ftiould not
be eternally finked for his finÂ«Â» Hume and Boling
broke, with elegance and elaboration, but with the
darkelf fophiilry, aivl Bndangfr, an audacious
Frenchman, in his " Chrilfianiry unveiled,' have
presumptuously attempted tofip the chuMian'sfor
trefs, and now, to represent the son of Mary as a
mere man, and now, as an impostor. These wri
tings have induced flimfy opinions, called, from
their nature, Deiflical, to predominate, and theit
profeffori, far from confnliint; the editions either of
England or Geneva, will inspeCt no bible. Per
haps the accurate reader will pronounce my enu
meration incomplete, unlcfs I notice that second e
dition of Tom Thumb's folio, called, " The Age !
0 of Reason." But as this, in mechanics' phrale
iÂ» but a bungling vamp of obsolete infidelity, writ-; '
ten by a drunken author, rarely quoted, except by j !
thÂ« lowed vulgar, and then in thelifping accents of
intoxication ; I will not condtfcend to an jnalyfis, '
but terminate this head of my difeouife with the '
warmed wilhes, that, in spite of jaring opinions, 1
gospel charity and benevolence may be everludingly
Lfhiouable, and that men will not expeCt a more ex.
cellent mode from the new fanghd loos.is of Paine
and of Paris.
Physic haÂ» experienced more revolutions than Po- '
land, or even France, since the Capets are no more.
Boerhaave has prescribed at LeydeÃ, what Brown '
would rejett at Edinburgh. Gout mull be pam- '
pered according to one phyfrcran, and Itarvedby a- '
rother. The small pox, like Sancho Pai za, is j
sometimes blai keted into fubmiUion,and fÂ«>metimeÂ»
every wind mud be uivoked to blow the infeCtion
,away. Dr. Cheyn# infills that his patients shall V
quaff a perpetual bowl of milk, while a more jolly '
physician direCts as perpetual and much tudHier
draughts. Le Sage's Sangrado drained eveiy vein, <
and now every vein mud be inflated like a bladder, j"
Cullen departed from B-jerhaave, Brown has rx- f
posed and abjured the hercfy of Cullen, and proba
b!y by this time some European projector, lias %

old.
A Logician, considering the two fubjeCls as c
-qually variable, would infallibly claf< weather ccicks
and politic* togi-ther. We behold vad esipires
sometimes governed by a solitary woman and pet- 1
ty dates headed by a mob of rulers. Kings, once
ranked with Gods, arc suddenly and capnciouflv C
degraded among felons. Government, as a ncr- f,
vous writer cxprefTes it, is sometimes scandalously t
relaxed, and then violently llretctied beyond its ~
tone. The Corinthian capital of society! babori- i,
oufly ere&ed by ari'.tocraucal artills, 13 proltrated f
by papular fury in an hour. In our own country, c
political modes are perpetually fluctuating. Prior a
to the formation of French fiiendfhip, that people, j
.their religion, and their politics, wete equally de- t
tested. The pope was Antichrilt, the French king f
his high Stewaid, the government of France was f
the archetype of Tuikifli defpotiim, and the nation
viewed as a motley collection of coxcombs and
. {laves. Mark the indant operation of a fi.igle de- <j

cÂ»ptu."Â«d Burgoytie could met?moiph.)fe an arbitra p

i? Mr. FennO,
* IF we do not suppose a certain class of News
paper writers, to be paid, to calumniate the Ptefi
s dent and government of the United Statesâit will
be difficult to chfcover any other adequate ciufe
' for tfcrir ceafclefn and laboured drains of detraction,
"j The thunder that alarms is not htard every day ;
nor is Etna always difgotgiiig- its deSruCtive lava
on the neighbouring fields : Not so a certain pa- j

1 mation agsiinft the mo(l spotless characters.
What is to be the ifTue of such inordinate and

men to serve the public, or to throw the manage

-calumniator*. The Athepians it is trueârevered
calumny and ereCted a statue to her honor ;do these
' writers or rather their employers cxpeCt, that the
fame causes operating here, will produce the fame

United States to be destroyed, in order that they
may dine ?
I According to them, tliye is no fonn Vfs m Go

man whose measures and politics, will draw forth
the praiiesof remoted posterity ; and whose con
duct patriotilm will fcrve as a fliriiulus and

fit to be trailed with power ; He it feem6 ought
loriy since, to have retired to the (hade, and yielded
up the tcITcI of (late to fo\ne more fkilful pilot.
According to them, every aft of his admini'tra

constitution. To take advice or allc the opinion of
the principal officers of the executive department} '
in critical or diin ult cases, is a crime ngainlt the j
Constitution, altho' these functionaries are enjoined 1
by tbat.mllrument, to give to the President as of- !
ten as required, evety information relative to their
departments.
What oKjeCts come under the cognizance of these
j departments ; do they not (evcrally and conjointly I
encircle and embrace the whole liiterelts of the
United States ? How then can any thing bear up
on the United States, either fiom abroad or at

their situation ought to pofllfs the molt correCt,
and minute know'ege of whatever in its

Mount-Hope, 24th July, 1796.- <
From the Edenton Gazette. [
To the Citizens of the State of North Carolina. j
Whereas there have lately appeared in the State '
Gr.zette, preferments from the grand juries for J
â  everal counties in the diliriit of Edenton, wherein
they present us, the people called Quakers, and OIU r
abettors, " as the authors of the common mifchiVf c
in this quarter which preferments-, though they \
dre.led in the language of ax artful orator, yet
contain, as appears to us, futidry unjull reflections, x
abfurdit.es, and exaggerations : Therefore we think J
it expedient (for the lake of f.me, who, fÂ«r want
oi better information may be led into error, by c
such mifreptefentations) in mecknef, to express our t
lentiments touching the charges thus exhibited a- a
gamti ill. t
Fir'l, they present. Â» That the country is re- {
uuced to a inuation of great peril and danger, in
confluence of proceedings of the society of the "i
people called On .kcrsâthat the idea of emanei i
pat,on among fbveÂ» is publicly held out to them >
and encouraged by thÂ« conduct of the Quakers J S
that the minds of the slaves are not only wrea'tlv c
corrupted and alienated from the fervice'of , heir J
millers, in confluence of said conduct, but run- 1
a ways are protected, harbored and encouraged by a
!>f diicoveiy Â»" re LOmmi '" ed wi,hout Â» pofSbility I
If those counties are reduced, as is fa.d, to great 1
danger we arc confcions the cause thereof cannot '
jullly be 1 pap a led to our conduct ref f ,eftiâ K eman- 1
c.pation ; for ifan tffed he eviJ, ,h c caufc prod(|c .
mg that cffeCt mutt Lkcvwfe be evil; bu: whai we, a
f as a religious society, hive done therein, we are ful
ly prrfirHtc! proceeded from motives truly good,
and coofn'leot with thr nature and spirit of the gnf.
â¢ pel, which breathes peace on enth, and goad will
tÂ»> men, and is never piodu&ive of corruption, dif
ort'er, or evil, in the cre-.tiÂ®n"; neither doth this
beneficent spirit ever inflignte any man to com
mit a criminal adh as the filing his neighbour's
house. All fucli are works of darkness, and pro
ceed from that spirit who is she a'uthor of confofioh,
' and an adterfary to eqnity, love ind harmony.â
; And we are apprehensive that the emancipation of
the slaves is not inconiiftent wit.li a declaration of
the general Congrcfs, which is in these words .
1 " We hold these rn;tliÃ to be felf-evident, that all |
men arc created rq:i:t!, that they are endowed by
their creator with certain unalienable riglvs, that
among thef.- are life,liberty,and the putfuit of hap
piuefs, and to secure rights governments aie
inllituted among men," 3cr.
Fuither it is fa:d, " The grand jury are so per
fectly sensible of the infatuated" enthnliafm of the !
Quakers, as to partial and general emancipation, !
that they fee a present alarm among the minds ot
the peoph, and fore fee a profpeit of immediate j
dasger ta impend, by the influence and dc/igning j
attempts of the Quakers to this pilrpofe, tvhicn,un
lefÂ» prevented in due time, mnft'burlt with d-lliuc
tion around the citixens of the Hate." Strange
indeed ! at this day, when th-. humane spirit of li
berty hath so greatly use's among the peo- j
pic tinder the federal government, that any of the I
citizens within the union (hould luffer themselves to I
be so far mifl d, as publicly to lligicatize it with i
the opprobrious appellation of " infatuated enthu-j
fialm.
As to general emancipation, if they fugged that
we endeavor to obtsin a law to compel any to eman
cipptetheir flavts, we deny it. What we have re
qi)efted in our petitions to the general aflemblv re
lative ta the matter, hath been only to this effecf
j viz. That those who are confcieutiotifly scrupulous
of keeping their fellow creatures in a state of slavery,
i wight have thepsniU-ge of emancipating them,and
I that the perftfns so liberated might be protected by
law. It is well known that the le'gillatiirc of this
j ilate have frequently granted what is called partial
I emancipations ; why then fhon'.d re be cenfnred
| for ourfen:imeÂ»t in that refpeft ?
Tou. hing the alarm, which th - f â¢.y they fee,and
the profpedt of impending da r, &c. If any
j fu..h profpedls are viliblf, we have reason to believe
that those things arise not from our influence ; and
we are clear of any malevolent design to thi3 pur
pose, t"hat might give jull creation for such an a
larm.
They furthr advance, " The grand jury rcfleft
ir>g upon the miserable havoc and which
have lately taken plaje in the Well Indies in confe
rence of emancipation." To this we may fay,
we do not conceive, that emancipation, proceeding
purely from reliffotiÃ motives bath been the original
eaufe of maflacres either in the Weft Indies, or
elfewheie, as may be obvious from an impartial in
formal ion. As to the other circumftanees which
they mention, inducing them to present us and our
abettors, these appear to us to'be futile, and with 1
otn jiift grounds, and we doubt not, but upon an
accurate scrutiny will so appear to every unprejudi
cate reader. I
Lastly, "The grand jury present, that fperdy
and resolute menfures ought to be adopted by the
good frnfe and spirit of the people, in order to pre- '
vent that common appeal to arms, in their Own de
fence, which at present appears to be almofi, if not
altogether neceflWy." We hope that people of
good sense, and atffuated by a good spirit will not
ic movtd by the exaggeration tj'f a few individuals,
blinded by prtjudicc, to adopt measures incompati. c
ble with the principles of a free ChrifHan Re'pub- 1
lie ; under which they enjoy their religious liberty, j
and for which favor we ought to render thankful '
acknowledgements, in gratitude to the divine all '
wife Disposer of the hearts of men. f

these the greater part had been conquered by Francis I c

e About 'he time when Rufns King, was ap
pointed Minister from I 1. United States, to Lon

: I papers, that Mr. Pinckney, "our late Mir.ilter had
, i solicited his recall :âAlthough there we're many
t who doubted the truth of the assertion at .that time,
; ' yet it was received with an acquiescence, that made'
r j it pÂ»fs for a fadl.
. I There is good reason however to fwppofe and be.
. I lieve, that Mr. Pinekuey, did not requell to be re
: i called ; from very good authority, there is reason to
.! fay that on the 17th of April last, Mr. Pinckney
. j had no idea of leaving London, yet Mr. King was

i I ter of Mr. Pinckney, was not calculated to please

we ought to know for what reasons they are remo

cafy to give an extract of a letter containing such

given at a proper time) that Mr. Pinckney, did

CONFESSION of tSF. AURORA.
In the Gazette of the United States of

but very few of the writers in the Aurora, who
have, unawed by the magic-os a founding name,
feminized the public couduft of the Prefidcnt,
have one drop of .American blood in their veins.
The assertion is falfe. The Public are assured, up
on better authority than the Editor of the Ga

fefs, that chief of the pieces that bay appeared in
the Aurora upon that luhjeft are from native
Americans.
Neither the Aurora, nor the writers of the Aurora

fOR TIIS G AZETTE OF THE UNITED STATUS,
Mr. Fenno,
THE letters relative to the capture of Capt.
St Barbe, exhibit the conduct of PoMer in a light
that muil render him detellable i.i the view of the
civilized .vorld. Potter is not the only uiltance ;
the ptcfent war has developed many such charailer#
âand these are not confincd to one nation 01 ly.
It is the wiih of humanity, that the finger of
scorn and contempt may be pointed at such mon
sters, till shame and re-tnorfe shall banish them from
Society. It appears that a proper abhorrence of
Potter's conduA is entertained by" the officers of
the British army, and that they are determined ta
inten.il themselves against him.
\\ hen this is taken into confederation, in con
nexion wi:h the truly magnanimous condu& obser
ved towards Capt. Hodg(Â», (who saved a British
transport) not only by the British executive, but by
indivi iuals and corporative bodies of that nation, !
fee no propriety in stigmatizing the whole for a
tranfaftion which we arc sure they mull execrate,
by a puerile ironicifm, in clafling it among " evi
dence 3of Britifli amity"âln a letter on this fiib- '
jc-a, a hope is expressed, that Potter's infamous
condud " will be a caution to all Americans when
ever they fee an English ship in diflrefs to shun l^r."
This was doutstlefs a flip of the penâthe laws of
humanity are eternally binding, and it ought to be
remembeied are reciprocal.
The contrary fer.timent if adopted, would trans
form mankind to brutes. The magnanimity and
ju.tice of the British Nation will be exhibited on
this occasionâThe example of Capt. Hodge, ia
.pledge of the foimer, and every principle of com
mon right will ensure the other.

PARIS, Bth Prairial, May 27. anc<
It is aflerted that when the Emperor sent from
Vienna to rentfw the hostilities 011 th:.* Rhine, he ( | ie
was ignorant of the recent loffcs fuilained by his j ( j (
army in Italy. On the 2d Praii i=>l his generals no ( ; on
tified to ours the ce(TÂ«tion of the armistice, w'tich k vc
has been granted to Austria, in order to induce ber t>n
to accept a peace no more necefl.iry to her thaN to opj
us. ; Dot
The arch-duke Charles, wishing to conceal from s
his army the entire defeat of that of Italy, caused
the bells to ring, and the te deutn to be lung on
the other bank of the Rhine, as if to celebrate a
viftoty ; but artifice could not long here succeed,
and i feemsthat he has been compelled to conlefs
the reverse ; never-thelefs, he lill endeavored to pal- j n Â£
liale it by stating the loss but at 4000 men. an( i

ere From a Correspondent.
IeÂ« There are Well grounded reasons for expefiing A
1 a that the President of the United States will relign days
rer a t the expiration of the term for which he was elec- Phil;
'!es ted, that is in March next, and that his fellow ci- J
" tizens will bit informed of his determination by an Effti
address, in the couvfe of a few weeks. It is expeftcd fchr.
that he will be solicited to continue longer in of. ca.
(ice, but surely if the President announces his de- fiom
l ' le termination to resign, no hing could be more indcl- 81
icate, or ((t is presumed) more otfenfiye to the feel niola
ings of the President, than to rcqurtt his coutinu- and
ance.in office. In short, it is impofllble that such B
om felicitation* can proceed from the real filends ofr 29,
the honor, peace, and happiness of Wulhington. Si.
s It is possible that there are men so devoted to lac- '1
"Â° tion and party, w.ho from an apprehension that lone teer
,ct i favorite of their own might not be eleiSed Preli- Uiis
er dent, or to prevent the election of some person of fate
t0 opaolite political fentimcnt* to themselves, would Ji
not hefitatc. to (olicit the Pr^tidcnt to continue in Leii
om his office ; but would nny man who widied welUto Pan
' re<l the fame of the President aflt him to a& a part 65,
on which would liken him to that hypocritical tyrant f,on
c a Anguftus, who constantly made of his plei
;o< '' willies and intentions to resign, yet always had his 1
s minions and tools at hand to fnlicit his continuance fine
f a '" in office ?to those foiicitaiionj he always yielded, ton
and died in the office he had usurpedâos such un- vre
worthy motives no friend of Washington can be- Cad
lieve him aÂ£luate<j, and it would an insult to Col
suppose it. If it is the with of that great man to icrs
retire from office, may the bleffingi of his fellow son,
tory citizens follow him, they will not cease to venerate ner.
v . ate hie virtues, though he may cease 10 serve them. Gal
Who the successor of Wiifhington may be, it is met
" ,er " uncertainâdifferent opinions and withes will direst Cat
110n ' diffeient menâsuch is the nature of a government Lo
like ours, and to suppose that the office can only be Stc
filled by but oce man, is a libel on the constitution
I J '' J " âit is a libel on all republican government. Such for
nl ) * cr an opinion (hould be treated as a degree of folly j
approximating to insanity, because it can only be to
lenti- f U ppy r teJ by a belief that one maa will live forever.

N. B. To fivoor those who may take a quantity of
Tickcts, the prize of 40,000 dollars will be the L * st drawn
ticket, and the 30,000 the last but one :
And approved notes, fecujing payment in either money
er prizes, in ten days alter drawing, will be received for
any number not less than 30 tickets.
This Lottery will afford an elegant specimen of thepri
vate buildings to be erevfted in the City of Washingtonâ ,
Two beautiful designs are already fel"Aed for the entire
fronts on two of the public squares; from these prawings c
it is proposed to erect two centre and four comer buildings, a
as soon as possible after this lottery is fold, and to convey a
them, when complete, to the fortunate adventurers, in I
the manner described in the scheme for the Hotel Lottery. |
A nett dedu&ion of five per cent, will be made to defray ,
the oeceffary expenses of printing, &c. and the surplus 1
will be made a part of the fund intended for the Natianal :
University, to be erected within the city of Washington. <
The rawing will commence as soon as the tickets are 1
fold off.âThe rkfiney prizes will bepayAlain thirty days (
after it is finifhad ; and ajiy pr zes for whkh fortunate (
slumbers ate not produced within twelve months after the 1
drawing Â» clofcd, are to be considered as given towards i
the fun., for the University ; it being determined to fettle i
thfi wliole business in a year from the c iding of the draw- ]
inj, and to take up the bonds given as security.
The real fecuritiesgiven for the payment of the Prizes, ,
,re held by the Prcfident and two Diredors of the Bank ;
of Columbia, and are valued at more than half the a
mount at the lottery.
The twenty four gentlemen who by appointment of ;
the late CommiSioners afTffled in the management of the
Hotel Lottery are requeued to undertake this arduous task
a second time on behalf of the public ; a fufficient num
ber of these having kindly accepted, it is hoped that the
friends to a National University and the other federal ob
jects may continue to favor the design.
By accounts received from the different parts of the
Continent as well as from Europie, where the tickets
have been sent for sale, th; public are a flu red that the
drawing will fpeyiily commenae, and that the care and
eautio;i unavoidably ncceffary to insure a fafe disposal of
th* tickets, has rendered the stu<r fufpeqfion indifpcufable.
