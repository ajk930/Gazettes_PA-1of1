FOREIGN INTERCOURSE.
TWESDAYâ FEBRUARY 27.
f Coi:iÂ» ..-d /rjm San dsf s 'â¢Â«Â» ftr )
Mr. J. Wieliams (New-York) said that
though the fatigne from the long discussion
already had, on the amendment propufcd,
must be sensibly felt, yet, ss it was * qnef
tion of great magnitude because its conse
quences affefted the constitution of thecoun
try, by a new conflrudion of its refpeftive
1 powers ; he Aoped to he permitted to take
some view of the fubjed, and here he would
1 remark* when the amendment was firll pro
pofed,he had not then re3e&e4 as much up
on the doArine to which it led, as he had
finee done.
If it had been the objedl of the gentleman
who introduced the amendment, to bring
hack the fsrtiga inttrcourfe to the ground
on which it Hood in the year 1796, be woutd
undoubtedly have paiTed over the firll fe&i
---â¢n of the bill and mevedafubftituteforthe
third section, which would have contained
the new system he has advanced ; because
the firlji feiftion of the bill was the fame as
wasena&ed in the year 179 c, and re-enaft
cd by every new Congreli fincc that time.
And the like salaries were to be continued
as given in the year 1790.
But that gentleman has since said, he in
tended to do away all the foreign intercourse
and thereby vesta power inthis,houfe, '.vhicb
the people by the conftitutioa has f&ctd in
another branch of the legislature ; which
principle, said Mr Williams, once fined in Â»
this house, would render the present confti
tutioa inactive ; and if the mover of the a
mendment had intended thereby to save ex
pence (which was a desirable objeA) he
would have moved to lefTen the present sala
ries, but inflead Â»f doing this, the gentle
man ha* brought forward a proportion,
which tho' in a different garb, is the fame
in substance, as had been difcuflcd about
two years since for fix or seven weeksâat
the last fefEoa about two or three weeks, and
now about four or five weeks more. Is this
the mode said he, for gentleman to save es
sences in government ? No 1 th* expeaces
incurred by the present debate, amounted
to more than it was contemplated to save.
He would a(k, how came this propofitiou
to be now brought forward i Was it to mar
the harmony of that house, at a period
when unanimity of sentiment and cool deli
beration were lo much wanted. That gen
tleman's goo4 t fenfe must have led him to :
suppose that the proposition would as ufwal
have drawn fcrth a warm debate ; and vio- '
lence in debate en the one fide would always !
induce violence on the other, and coafe- ;
quently irritate the party spirit so prevalent, â¢
the greatest curse which could happen to a j 1
nation, more especially at the present crisis
of our affairs, and had a tendency to ef- ,
trange the minds of the people from the |
government which they had set up. He ! 1
was sorry to fee hiÂ» friend from Georgia j
(Mr. Baldwin) the other day had de- ! -
parted from his usual cool deliberation and j 1
had wrought up his mind to an extremity,in i 1
which he drew inferences from the Prefi- ' ,
dent's speech in the year 1790, which on a j
re-consideration he would find were no way ) ]
applicable to the doctrine he had endeavour* \
ed to maintain. (Here Mr. Williams read I
that part of the President's speech alluded
to, and animadverted op Mr. Baldwin's ob
servations,) But that gentleman had said
he was for doing away hostility from among 1
the different branches of government and
cultivating harmony, notwithstanding which '
in the next breath he said he would vote for 1
the amendment. He would alk that gentle- 1
man what harmony could be expected from 1
such proceedings i the Prufident nominated j
a person as minister, agreeably to the con- i
ftitution, the Senate concur, and we refufe i
to appropriate, Mr. W. said he did not
believe gentlemen sincere when they advan- j
ced this doftrine, and if they were, they
had not reflected where it would lead them.
If the check was in that house which was
contended for, the Senate would have the '
fame check, and this would permit the Se- I
nate and execntivc to fead frum this house j
all members who could not from their pri
vate fortunes defray theii own expcnces and
support their families ; Or would the gentle- j
men who were advocates for this doCfrine, !
have the members of this honfe like those in
the House of Commons in England, per
sons of great interell and depending on pa
tronage. But, said he, I (hall be told that
the members of the legislature have too high
'wages. This he said was admitted, as he
thought, at the time the wages were fixed
by the firft Congress, twice the sum neces
sary was allowed, but the high prices of ar
ticles finee had brought it right, and when
the articles came down to the old Harvard,
he was persuaded the wages would be lefTen
ed accordingly. But the very reason why
Congress had erred on the one fide wa* a
good argument why they might err on the
other, especially when they had an objeil
in view, he thought that the constitution
had provided that a reasonable compensation
should be allowed, so as the mediocrity of
the people might lend such as they pleased,
but the do&rine contended for would cause
the republican principles contemplated by
the constitution to be done away, and an a -
riftocracy introduced. Bcfides it would do
away the treaty making power, veiled by
the constitution in the Prelident and Senate
and give the sole power tn. the Horse of f
representatives. For inftaoce, the Prefi- 1
dent, the other day, nominated three com.
mi'fiioners to hald a treaty with the Indians,
>â¢ the fenatc concurred, :.od the appointment
was made* The executive sent to this lioufe
the proceedings, and required an appreci
ation. But fuppofc, (aid be, we had dif.
agreed, and made no appropriation, could
the treaty be Md No y foin the eafcthc
' lad feffioti, the exeemivc informed us that
' he wati about to fend a miuiller to Berlin j
> we made the appropriation ; a minider was
appointed, and sent. And now an aft is tg
be passed tÂ«t recall him. He would put the
quedion more home, and arte if the choice
had fallen on one of those who advocated
' the amendment, and accepted the appoint
-1 ment, arranged his affairs, and gone to the
place affignrd him, but in tlx or seven month*
thereafter, was recalled ; what would he
fay? Would hejuflify such proceedings?
Said he, the fecuricy of government cost-
Allg in a liable and uniform cenduft, then
those who are to be ruled by the laws would
know how to aft.
The gentleman (Mr. Nicholas) had said,
he _was devoted to a republican form. of
government 5 but said Mr. W. they had
but one criterian to form their judgment
by ; that was contained in the bÂ«#ok of trutft
" b *h<> r Ivor It yeJhall intte them." How
can it be fnppofed that gentlemrn are sin
cere when they talk of feeble minoritiej be
ing necessary in eleftive governments, when
the majnrty are to mle i In a A/n<W won
arehy, feeble minorities might be servicea
ble to a certain degree : but feeble minorities
Â»o a-* elective pr.vernment, are as a <p.rk
of fire in a building, which if not checked
would cob fume the whole fabric,. How
had thisfpark been checked of late in our
government ? By the firmnefs of the Prefi.
dent aided by the yeomanry of the country,
who are the mod numerous part of the
community j and it is to he hoped, thÂ«
mod virtuous. They are the mod enlight.
ened of any nation ob earth as to matters of
government.
Much had been said, relative to the Pr*Â»
fidenPs appointing officers of his own poÂ«
litical opinion. He thought the executive
would not aft confidently in cale he ap.
pointed any officers of'the heads of de
partments or diplomatic agents not of hit
political opinion ; there would be a contin*
ual jargon; indead of harmony so essential.
ly necessary in the different officers who had
to coofult on the necessary meafiires to bs
pursued, as the good book fays, " a house
divided againd itfelf cannot dand. " H C
would afl< if it wotild be prudent for tlvf
! executive to chufe a man who* had been alÂ»
ways opposed to commerce, to be sent to â¢
foreign nation to negociate and contend for
our commercial interedt ?-This house adopt*
this very principle. A member rises lit hi*
place and moves a resolution containing cer.
tam principles he wiÂ£hes to have adopted*
The house agrees to the resolution j a cons*
mittee is appointed to detail the principle f
btit is this committee composed of members
who are opposed ti the principle of tht
resolution ? The executive he believed,
went no further in the appointment of those
of his political opinions, as the other day
he had made an appointment to a confidera.
ble trust of a gentleman not of hit poljci.
cal opinion.
His colleague (Mr. Havens) had just
been quoting precedents from the English
conditution , he would aflc if that confti.
tution was like the conditution we were unÂ»
der > No. The cos flit Â»t ion of England
was made up of usages, cudoms, &c. ours
was written, and therefore the precedents
would not apply, The house of commons
in England had a right to originate all mo
ney bills ; the house of lords had no right
to alter or ataiend. But was this the cafe
with ourfenate ? The senate under our eon
ftitution has a right to alter, amend or re.
jest. That gentleman had said (hat money
had been made use of, in opposition to the
sense of this
to intimate that we contend that all mult
agree to the principles of legislation adopt,
ed by the executive ; and he instanced the
cafe of the frigates ; but said Mr, W. thia
was an unfortunate inference of His colleagn#
because the legifiature had reduced the fri
gates from fix In three, and he believed thit
was not even the wish of the executive, and
he was confident that no money had been
expended, but what had been appropriated*
As to the executive patronage, said Mr. W.
in England the king has the disposal of all
offices, and he is not responsible. Here it
is otherwise { the President is elffted for
four years, at the end of which he returns
to the people and is impeachable. Whca
there are more candidates, than one for an
office, the disappointed will generally be
opposed to the re-eleftion of the President,
and may make iotered againd it by hit
friends, and the one that is appointed will
seldom trouble himfelf about it. He men
tioned a cafe in the date of New-York,
whose conditution relative to the appvint.
ment of officers was ftmilar to that of the
United States, It was a cafe refpefting
the appointmenr of a ft-.riff, the one dis
appointed, made great interest againd the
governor's eleftion, while the man who ob.
tained the appointment, had been inaftive,
and the gov(Â£nor had nearly lod his eleftion;
and he was persuaded the power of the
President to nominate, would always ope.
rate againd his influence.
Gentlemen to support their position, that
no foreign miniders are wanted, fay we
ought to have no conneftionjwith Europe,
only as buyers and venders of their ma no*
faitures, if this was all we had to do, said
Mr. "VVilliartaÂ», we wanted 00 miqidcrt nmr
IVeLim XIII.te si.l*. He was not much acquainted f.th p
< 1 nsr erccj he was 3 farmer, but he had t -'ad 1
\ Qftu ifling on that fnbjrct and believed tnat a
nmvuirtce was to a certain degree n<?df!T<irT; 1
it been extended too far, but the 1
merchants knew we could not give rhem c
i*c -f.ary pr'teiSHon, andconfequently muil '
rill< their vessels and caries. This it is pre- j
fumed they will do, while they find it ben- '
efie- it!, and this was evidently the cafe, be- |
cau>e* we are now foppofed to be the second
eomnercial nationin the world. And it ap
peared to him that commerce was the hand
maid of agriculture ; and the greater the
competition in our market* between the fo
reign merchants and our own, the bet
ter market, and greater demand for the pro
duce of our country. Thus the farmer will
obtain a higher price and quicker sale for
fc'hat he has to dispose of, but on the other
hand, if there was no competition in ottr
markets, the farmer must fell at a price our
merchants may (in a combination) please to
give, or (lore his articles until the (hip own
er will please to carry it away.
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Ni
cholas) had said, that the executive power
growing out of the diplomatic department,
would cause war, ruin and deftru&iop; this
said Mr. W. might happen, if the majori
ty of our people (hould become insane, and
chufc men to fill offices, whofedetermination
it was to ruin the country. The executive
could nut do it alone, because the advice and
consent of the Senate was required, and the
majority of this house must agree to it, be
cause it is to be presumed that no greater
salaries would be given than were necessary.
Beside*, the constitution provides for an
impeachment, and at the end of four years
the executive returns to the people; there is
another provision in the constitution, that
is, the people can amend it and take from
the executive what power they please, thus
we find the state that gentleman comes from
sent out two years ago, certain amendments
3nd dt this tin* the measure is renewed.â
The people not think prudent to adopt
tliem two yeas since ; this (hews, however,
the-Legiflature of the state from whence
a number of the advocates for these new doc J
trines come, ido not think the power con
tended for is in this house, or they would
not wi(h an amendment to the conftitutios.
Mr. W. said, it was prudent for the people
to watch the Â»ifficers of govcrnireut, but
not be too jealous so as to destroy the eonfi
denee reposed in them.
The gert.Vman from Virginia (Mr Ni
cholas) said that commerce was partial to
Great Britain; if so, 1 id Mr. W. why is
liyt something, brought forward to restrain
it? or did g> ntlemen suppose it would be
proper to restrain them; he believed it would
be an improper thing, he had always under
fiood it v.-a. berf to let commerce regulate
nfe'lf. He would aflc that gentleman what
ivuuld his cenftituents in Virginfa have said,
if Congress had prevented them , from felling
horleo to the Englilh about two yenrs ago,
notwithstanding. they were so frenchifi. d,yet
they fold the huTes to the English, because
they receivf d a greater price for them. A
gain, why are those gentlemen dressed with
Engiilh.manufactures? what would they fay
if they' were prevented from purchasing
thena ? Hence, fcid he, the gtntlemen (hould
not prevent him from felling the produce of
his farm to those who would give the most
for it, and like them purchase the Englift
manufactures, becaufethey were the belt and
cheapest.
Gentlemen fay, the constitution provides
for the appointment of ministers by the Pre
sident; but only gives the power parti
ally, because, fay they, their falariÂ«s were
to be fixed by Congress. Here said he was
the check, the conftitrftional check, (to
nvit) this house (hall fay what was a reasona
ble compenfatioii for the officers fa appoint
ed.
When the general convention met to form
the present constitution, said Mr. W. no
doubt but they had a view to all the differ
ent constitutions then extant, many difficul
ties arose; at length an agreement was made
between the great and small states, that the
latter Ihould have an equal representation in
the Senate, which conftitiited one branch of
the Legislature, and advice and consent were
to be given by a quoram of this body to the
nomination of all officer; by the Prefide'nt,
who by the nature of his office would have
the means of information from foteigj) pow
erj. Thus the nomination of ministers -
where to be sentâand of what grade, was
veiled in the President. So in the treaty
making pouWr, this body being composed
of an equal number, and power, from each
(late, in which the small states retained their
sovereignty, and notwithstanding this, yet
so careful was the convention, of this great
power, that two thirds of this body was tÂ©
-agree to all treaties before they became the
supreme laws of the land. Yet some of the
members here, representing small states, are
for giving up this sovereignty which was so
Itrenuoufly contended for in the convention,
and solemnly agreed to; and take the pow
er front the Executive and Senate by a new
doctrine, which if once obtained it would
give a power to the representatives of four
states to control at their will and pleasure,
the remaining twelve states. This, said he,
was evident, because the states of Virginia, j
.North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Massachu
setts had more members in that house than
the other twelve states. Was this power in
this house as contended for by some, it would
deprive the Executive and Senate of the
appointment of diplomatic officers., or mak
ing treaties. For instance said he, the gen
tleman (Mr. Nicholas) had said he was for
doing away all the foreign intercoutfe. Let
us take it for granted that this was the cafe,
and that we bad no foreign minister, and no
one was to be appointed previous to an ap
propriation-âCongrtfs adjourn âand a fliort
â¢time thereafter, the Trench dire&ory (hould
Kave come to their senses, they fend to our
government that they wouM do us justice,
j pay for the depredations on our commerce,
discharge the debts due to our cititen.'f and
â¢ would eutcr into a new treaty with us upon
principles of vtcfprocit?. Would not this In
l-e a desirable objcft to tre3t with them, tor pi
although* by the hwÂ» of nations we are not e>
holden to any treaty at this time, becauie, c;
when two nations enter into a treaty, and di
one breaks a part thereof, the other is not u
bound: yet it was a desirable object to be at g
peace*ith all nations. In this cafe, how U
would the Executive a&? He mull call con- ii
grefs together; this would take much time w
and be attended with great txpence; yet n
this must be done. Wheu Congress comes t.
together they are informed of the bufineis, a
but fuppÂ«fe a majority are opposed to a trea- a
ty being entered into with that nation, and ]
will not agree to an appropriation âwill not a
this prevent a treaty being made? and will [
ft tiot be in the power of four Hates to con- v
tr<A the other twelve states? Befidethis, nip
pofing the majority fay we will appropriate c
but it (hall be provided such a person and 1
such grade. Let the gentlemen have the j
power they contend for this day, and they
would not agiee among themselves, much <
more the whole house, for fays the mover,
(Mr. Nicholas) lam for a minister plenipo- t
tentiary to France and England, a minister j
"resident to Holland, Portugal and Madrid,
fays another gentleman (Mr. Claiborne)
from Teneffee, the mover will agree for a
minister plenipotentiary to Spain (by the by â¢
how in unison those gentleman are) bnt
another member, a minister resident will do
at SpaiÃ. So that by the gentlemen's own I
declaration, we could not expett any thing
to be dÂ«ne, though their system was adopt
ed. It would be attended with an infinity j
of expences and delay, and in the end wonld.
reduce our republican system, by introduc
ing an arifiocracy, which would pave the
way to absolute tyranny. To prove that
the conftitntion would be rendered ina&ive,
he would only instance a cafe in the legisla
ture of New-York, in 1789. The two
branches of the legislature, were o-f differ
ent political opinions, the one would resolve
to appoint two characters, to reprcfent that
state in the Senate of theUoited States, but
the other branch would nÂ»t concur, they
would resolve to appoint two others of a
different political opininn. The confeqtience
was, that no appointment took place until
after a subsequent ele&ion, at which time
both branches were of one political opinion.
Hence, if the Â®ther states in the union had
beeH in a like situation, thp constitution of
the United States would not have gone in
to operation.
The genjleraan f r Â«m Virginia (Mr. Ni
cholas) and others had contended that the
different branches of onr government had a
chepk on each other, and they had inftane
ed a law passed relative to the judiciary, who
deemed the law nnconftitutional and did not
act thtreon. But by this had they a check
on the legislature? No. They did not aÂ£t;
and so in the cafe, when the call was made
two years ago on the Executive for some pa
pers relative to a treaty did not the Exec
utive refufe them? why? becaufe'faid he,
you have no eonftitutiooal right to them.â
Thus wÂ«â  find that each; body moves within
its refpeftive orbit So if a is called for
we appropriate what is deemed reasonable.
The mover of the amendment dwelt much
on the dobate, had on the palling the tirft
foreign intercourse bill, in the year 1790;
fut he did not ftatÂ« both fides of the quef
rion. Some of the debates werethe fame
as those used oh a late occasion, especially
the one by a gentleman from South Caroli
na (Mr. W. Smith) all the evidence howe
ver, we had on this fuhje& was, that the
law was passed, and had continued to be re
enafted by every new Congress since, it was .
something finguJar that this nevJ discovery
had not been made before now.
Much had been said relative to a minister
being sent to Berlin | the Preiident in his
speech at the lad session said, *! It was a nat
Viral policy for a nation that studies to be
neutral, to consult with other nations, en
gaged in the fame ftudiet and pursuits; 'at
the fame tiifce that meafuresought to be pur
sued with this view, our treatiss with Prus
sia aHd Sweden, one of which is expired,
and the other near expiring, might be re
newed." This, among other fubje&s iÂ»as
then referred to a committee, and an appro
priation made without debate or division,
this, said he, was the time to have made the
opposition. But it was said that a minister
was not wanted at Berlin. He believed if
gentlemen would reflect that minister
was not only appointed to Berlin, but also
to Sweden. Stockholm was not far dis
tant from Berlin. aHd one minister had been
sent to renew the treaties with Woth these
nations. What had been dene he knew not
as there were -no documents before them ;
but he thought it bad policy to rccal him,
if it was within their province until they
were informed the treaties were renewedâ
Decaufe it would cost them 9000 dollars
âºnort as an outfit, in cafe he was recalled be
fore the business was done. Beside, Berlin
was a place to obtain much commercial and
political information, so necessary at this
time both for our government, as well as our
othtr ministers at foreign courts.
He would not have said any thing rela
tive to the minister lately near the republic
of France, had it not been for two.expressi
ons which had fell from a gentleman (Mr.
Nicholas) the #ne was that, that minister
had been made a facrifice of, and the other,
that in that gentleman's opinion, peaee
with the French republic might have been
secured, but the executive had done all in
their power to cast it from us. With ref
pe6t to the firft, said Mi . W. if that Mi
â  nitter had been made a facrifice of, it muff
have been occasioned by his own conduit,
t for said that gentleman, another had been
, applied to, but expecting to be himfelf fa.
> crificcd would nc* accept. How came this
- gentleman to accept, said Mr. W. or had he
t not the discernment of him who refufed ;
1 hut as he did accept he ought so to have
r conducted, as to have merited the thanks,
, not the difplcafure of his country. If it
', was so, he was persuaded it had arifea from
d j tranfaftions. .
n I The ether exprtffion wasâÂ« the execu-
J
tive r.ad printed a prace"ât"Hls lie sup- j <tr
posed mull have been in consequence <jt the j in
executive's Â«ij*pftfing measures which were , thi
calculated to disturb the peace and indepen- pel
deuce of this country. If we look around prÂ«
us, laid Mr. W. and had time to investi
gate this fubjed, it would be easily shewn, pr
that tile executive had aded right in not
fufFeiing this country to be drawn into a m
I war with any nation ; and if we mull have ia
I 11 war (which G6d forbid) I hopt it will be ,
for refuting to depart from this principle ; in
and whoever will impartially trace the tranf- I e_
aftions of our government, refpeding the |
proceedings of the French nation and their j ec
agents will find that it has refpeded and ?-f
preftrved a uniform system of friend/hip, ul
which jullice to others, left uÂ« free to per- es
fcrfln. The, predicament of a neutral nati- â "
ou is peculiir and delicate, and imminently c '
so while it defends itfelf against charges of '
partiality from one of the warring powers, (7<
! leatt it fltould fecm to palliate the raifdoings'
of another.
Let us view for a moment, said Mr. W. f f
the tranfadions of an agent from that Re- c<
public, and previous to his being acknow- t)
ledg.ed as suchâhis tranfadions which mud ti
be understood the ads of his government. *
Were they not caleulatedtoinvolveusin war
abroad, aud discord and anarchy at home ? tl
And had not his ads and those of hiscon l k
federates been counteraded, we must long ft
finee been involved in a distressing war.â
I ask, said he, what insults have been borne Cl
with from sentiments of regard to that na- ai
tion ! Because the eftablilhed laws of our f<
land would not permit the executive at all '
times to go the full length of what the re- n
prcfentatives of the French republic wi(hed, h
it was to be etfpeded they would not as- o
cribe the omifiiou to any wait of cordiality ri
or friendfhip to that nation, but to the fovr- "
re'gnty of the'law. Hence because the ex- I
ecutive continued ftedfaft, in the principles "
of neutrality deeming that the interest of his 1
country, and using his endeavours and pre- t;
venting our citizens _frwÂ« embruirg their, y
hands in the blood of one nation, tp gratify
the hatrel, or serve the interest of another, a
This drev forth an appeal from the French f
minister t> the people, and heiice we may v
date the accumulated difficulties we have k
experiencd, are now labouring under, t
Notwithtknding all these iufults, the res- f
ped and tfteem for that cstion, and to (hew c
them how nuch we refpeded their endeavors Â«
for liberty disregarding the insults of their s
. agents, bah government and citizens, to r
prevent then from starving,' hastened to fop- 1
ply thera with provisions, and anticipated t
. the paymejt of all the debts which we con- <
i traded witi them during our -evolution. f
But the jppeal to the people and other f
tranfadion of their agent, created a party i
; against th: executive of ffty times the <
â  strength that the !Â«Â» chfTes mentioned by '
(Mr. Nicholas) who hi said were in favor of
. executive measures But before he went i
, into a refutation of that gentleman's argu- ]
. ments let us, said Mr. W.
i attend a !i-tle to what this facrificed minis- <
â¢ ter has dene, or rather what he has not '
done I j(k, said he, what has been <
i for injnries on our commerce under the au- j
thorityof the French government, andtheir 1
I agents longbtfore the treaty complaiaed of? 1
Of the spoliations and mal-treatment of our 1
â¢ vtffells by the French ships of war and pri- 1

seizures or forced sales of cargoes and ap- â 
( _plying them to their own use, without ma
â¢ kmg fatisfadory compensationâthe non- 1
performance of contrads made by their a
gents for suppliesâthe condemnation of our
i ve flels and cargoes incompatible with the '
treaties between them and us ? How many '
vefl'els Jhave they saptured, cargoes con
demned ! tlo! freight and demurage have
been decre<dto be paid by the committee !
of fafety. has any thing been paid ?
How many millions value of property have
they taken from our citizens without justice
and without compcnfation ! What then has
1 this facrificed minister done ? I wish gen
tlemen woild inform us what.lervices he
, has rendered his employers. Another gen
tleman fron Virginia (Mr. Brent) has al
â  ledged that we were indebted to this minis
ter for the peace we 7 enjoyed. This -was a
kind of peace however by no means agree
able: it appeared like a man attacking a
nother uuaimed and takipg all from him,
but declaring he wished to be in peace, tho'
he must have what he wanted, and what'hc
could get.' "'
It had been observed by a gentleman
(Mr. Nicholas) thathe was sorry this min
ister had laid- before the public all the offi
â  cial document# which had palled between
i him and the two governments. Mr. W.
said, he btlfeved that minister and'his friends
would indeed regret it before the citiceD3
I had done with it. That minister's book,
i and the remarks it had eXcitsd and would
excite, would be read and duly considered.
The people are the proper tribunal : give
- them time for refledion and they will always,
: judge right. That gentleman (Mr. Nicho
- las) thus changed his ground and fays hi
. was sorry that apart of it was"m..de known,
r Why not the whole ? It was, said Mr. W.
, because of the bftach of trust it discloses.
e Would the gentleman have only the fair and
n delusive portion of it publidicd, arid the dark
n and treacherous parts concealed ? How
.- cotild the people judge ? THey could not
i- judg? without having both fides. Surely
(I that Â£enllemaa was for* call of the papers
jon a similar occasion ; why not give the
n ! people every information now ? Full and
i- ! fair disclosures to the people will always lead
is 1 them to corred and honed opinions.

not been for the minister, would not have wei
been fettled for a long time. This is for wer
one house : no doubt but that others have feai

may with propriety fay that our minister at cou
London alone, has been the means of fav- wo:
ing to the citizens of this country, more reir
than all the diplomatic expence ; and altho' ert]
this money does not go into the treasury, m:j

For myfeif, said Mr. W. were I a iked a$ fori
a farmer refpeding the life t'sere was for ly 1
fereign ministers, I would answer that they ouj
were of little use, and the expence might du<
be saved } but whea he considered, that ver
these regulations would have a tendency to cor
promote commerce and thereby create a Th
competition in our markets, in the sale of ma
our agricultural produdions, and the far- ter
mer as wÂ«ll as those concerned in the fi(he- '
ries, -would gain in their prices of what they "
had to dispose of, he was led to believe,
that commercial regulation*, to a certain t [ a
extent, were necessary. But it had been
said that consuls would answer all these pur- kn
poles; he did not know, nor had he read Re
of much refped being paid them in any e <l
country, excepting where such country had
â¢ fadqries. - we
f The Britifli had a fadory at Peter(bÂ«rgh, j ie
t in Russia, in Lilkon, at Smyrna and Alep- w<
. po, and he believed at Leghorn ; in these op
. places, the confnls are considered as men tir
. of confeqt?ence, and no British fubjed can r . e
t be arretted for a Crime, until he is tried and â¢
, condemned by the consul, who ads as a -j-,-,
. judge, and'if found guilty, he is then de- ftj,
r livered over to the officers of justice of the Fi
? country. We have no fadories abioad, and w
r our cenfuls are chiefly feleded from 3- ed
- meng the merchants whose chief aim in ac
j cepting the appointmeht is to promote their
own interest as ipCTchants. And if th<fe"
. men were obliged to dance attendance on ()l
f account of business to the different fecreta- te
. ries of state in the European courts, they a\
. would lose their time and business, and of E 1
, eourfe must receive salaries. It will be ad
_ mitted, that their salaries would not be so
r great as that of a minister, but it must be
e remarked also, in the foreign coprts of Ell- c
j rope, where etiquette is considered as ne- ill
. ceffary, ar.d frpm custom, is become essen- cj
e tial: what a minister could effed at oneau- "
- ' dience withtlie minister, a consul or consul- u
" r 1 W
? general, would have to attend ar fend to
Â» the minister fifty times, before he could gain t j
Â» admittance, and complete. Tf said he, no L ,,
s minister was kept at a court, and the bufi- ti
- ness was to be tranfaded by a merchant as a |!1
e consul, after having travelled some distance
. perhaps, he must lose much time merely
. in the parade of attending levees of the so
vereign, his ministers and different fecreta- p,

ferent foreign ministers, in Order to gain the p

ifter of the court at which he resides as con- _
c ful. It was true the British consuls at El- "
feneur, at Dantzwi k and Hamburgh were e
n of importance, and refpeded, but what Si
made the consul at Elfeneur of importance ;i
i- was, his superior incami as consul, and the "
n high stile he was able tp 4 live in. For the jl
gopfular office at Elfencuh from his com- r
|Â« miffiutu on advances of paying the toll fees j

d caiie of "i 2,0001. fter. per annumâand this f
1. sum was more than our foieign ministers
re had, previous to the commissioners feat to
rs, France : but as long as the European min- (
1 .ifters are sent here, the ballance is in our j
ie favor ; as they ekpend more in this eoyn- j
n. try,' than our ministers are enabled to do a- j
J. broad.
8 . Here Mr. W. said, -he would fit down, 1
,d was it not for some observations which fell (
k from tlie gentleman who moved t v is amend- â¢ |
,w ment (Mr. Nicholas) refpeding the origin ; .
ot of party, who, he said, had thrown the 1
ly present existing influence into the hands of
rs the executive, and were the means of pur '
he suing it. To prove this, that gei#!eman j
nd had adverted to the funding the domestic J t
ad debt, which he said, was probably done to ,
produce a party in States, who j ;
en would support the executive. This ad,
or I Mr. W. observed, was passed on the 4th
;o, Anguft, 1790, at a when nine tenths
ny of the evidences of the domestic debt were
>c- in the hands of the fpcculators. But what
ol- had the executive to do with it ? If, said,,
ipe Mr. W. the executive had intended that i
in- funding the dorajftis debt would have eoo-
j tributed to IhY influence, an wasfo dif.
j-fofed, tlit executive would i~.t have canf
ed the debt to be funded, so as to take it
' out of thi hands of the many, to be put
l in the hands of a few, as that gentlemaa
had said ; but would so have arranged that
bufmefs, as that the debt when funded,
(hould have remained with the grcateft num
ber poflible, b'ccaufs the greater ttie cum
ber, the more the?influence.
Mr. W. said he was as much opposed to
the funding system as that gentleman, nor
had he ever any thing to do with it ; but a*
the faith of the nation was pledged for the
payment we were bound by honor to do it
in the bed manner we could. He believed,
however, the executive had no hand in it.
He was convinced that at that time there
â¢ ' were great speculations on all fide*, forte
wiftied for the funding system, others for
i the Penobfcotfexpedition, and the .building
â  the frigate in S. Carotua, nuthorifed by
! congrels to be paid for by the United States
â¢ âsome wanted the permanent feat of con
- grefs" where it was fixed ; and others agree
s iiirr to it to have a temporary rtfidence of
. congress here ; but what had the executive
i to do in all these matters ? This Mr. W.
! said he knew was doneâNew-York loft the
t ' residence of congress, and in the fettlemenfc
1 of accounts that state was charged with up
- wards of two millions unjustly, which he
1 hoped would never again be called for, be
e eaufe it was not due. The next class that
, gentleman took notice of which added to
. the influence of the executive was, thole
e unfortunate persons whp wrrt opposed to
t our revolution. These people, said Mr. VI .
e ! were men of different classes, some of them
r were opposed from principle and others frora
e fear and to gain favor. But at the elofe of
e , the war, they were moftiy driven from our
t country, and pcrhnps there was never a
- worse policy adopted. If we had let then\
e remain, as they were generally men of P'"P*
Â»' ; erty who were thus ordered away, our debts
, might have been much lelfensd, and as they

a Their supporting government in a peaceful

Mr. W. said at those twa classes of men, were
â b r ought into view by that gentleman, as the
1 fupporteri of the executive power, he would
bep the indulgence to mention some of those
n classes, who have been the oppofers.
" When the constitution, said he, was firft made
r- known, it of course eÃgroffed the public mind,
id Reason, prejudice, and paflion, equally prompt
iy ed the difcufiion of it âand the citizens were
j nearly divided for, and against it. i hnÂ» ft
went into operation. In its organization Â£j 1 * re

P" we have reason to believe have continued their
fe opposition in cenfequence thereof to the present
en time. In addition to this, whin the irench
an revolution commenced, and because the execu
j tive maintained a uniform system ot neutrality #
' and would not fuffer this country to be drawn
a from the full udt of prosperity, upon the
' c ~ shadows arad miseries of war, on the part of
be France, how many of our citizens were there
rid who endeavoured' to leflen the well earn
-3u ed confidence c\f the executive, ana render
IC ..| his adminift-ation unpopular; our youth fired
.* with ambition to enter into the French service,
J. r and urged,i-otonly by those of the party,but a IfÂ©
those who by misfortune or luxurious habits had
on outlived their fortune, as well a*others who for in
ta- rereft'wereanxioustohavethiscoHntry engaged in

id- go sgainft a nation with whom we were at
r peace, as well as those engaged in fitting out
*Â° privateers. Add those who were engaged Â»Â« a
I lucrative commerce with the inhabitants of St.
'U- Domingo, and who were checked by the Brit
ie- ;(h, who would not fuffer the commerce to be
carr edonin the manner not permitted by France
lU . n a time of peace. And to crown the whole,
i what party was created when the proclamation
was inued relative to the neutrality ? And altho
this was approved of by men of the firft abili
un ties, and by those who are 4ooked up to by the
no advocates of the amendment, but who are in
ifi the opposition to the executive, yet it created
5 a innumerable opponents to the executive, be
.ce cause private interest overcaase public good.â
i And notwithstanding the executive had done all
that was confident for the French nation, keep
ing in view our neutrality <*nd to maintain
ta- rxaee , yet the minister of that nation appealed
lif- to the peopleâand although the executive was
â¢he pursuing every prudent mcafure.for the good of
ind the peopie, and to prevent a war, yet what an
in- opposition was formed fifty times as Are tig as
the two parties mentioned by Mr. VubohiSy
J?" and had it not been that a wife providence who
. vev-rule* all things, and human prudence in the
executive, we must at that time have been drawn
hat into a war. The yeomanry of our country

t y, e interested views, they, so far as my information
t i and knowledge extends, although they were at
firft opposed <Â« the Â«oÂ»ftitution, fearing anew
,m " revolution, engaged on the Sdeof government.
:ecs This alTertion is verified, if we take a view ot
irÂ«S the state of New-York,and the Eastern flatei j
in- lot when the constitution took place, three
thi, fourths were opposed to it ip the northern and
iâ rs wellern parts of New-York, aÂ»d now three
' fourths of them are attached to its support. And
. why was thi, change in the great commercial
lin - cities ? because the executive prevented that
our privateering and illicit commerce which mult
V*n- heve involved us in a war abroad and lifc-rd
oa- at home i but, for a momentary benefit, num
ber, have opposed the executive, and in conle
wn quence thereof a great opposition has appeared.

But the Brinfh fnding that our government was
3etermined Â«to fupp;irt their neutrality, and
would go to war in cafe the insult was continued,
theydefifted ; and so would the French natioir
have done, had not a party exifled among our
selves, who were conllantly buzzing in the ears
of the rulers in France, that the people were op
posed, to their governm nt. What wasfaicfrto
our late minister to France by fbeir minister, was
jfufficient to (hew this. But how has it operat
ed ? the French have been deceived, and their
Wif'appointment has cauf?d them to do what
they would not otherwise have done. 'I hey
had' bean I'd to believe, that through the influ
ence of certain gentlemen, tie yeomanry of our
country would do anything for 'hem, even en
ter into a war in their favour in eppofition to
Iheir own government. In this thev hav been
disappointed, and this had texed thein, so as
to fall on otir defencHefn commerce. When
men are vexed, they will commit excefTes j in

that the memb rs in this house were ailing a

that be could in fix months change their opin

Lbelt.eve it was the wish of the yeom Â»nry of

ple's opp fit ion to our government) expefl
mu h frost the people, or that they would en
gase in a war in their favour, not Only void
of truth, bur calculated to do much mifchief ;
and this we have experienced. To this we may
attribute the d fficulties that have arisen from
the tranfaiili ns of our own people, arising from
f .hie minorities, and the idea of the people with

jtift and impa'tial to foreign nations, there were
jit for it, and only 45 against it. On what
principle then, can that gentleman fay " the
people are ivith us ?" These obfervationt are
not only unfounded, but have been attended
with the woril effedls to our country. The as
sertion has encouraged privateers being fitted
out here ; f am told of a Angle company who

our merchants have been so plundered, that
numerou engagements have not been complied
with, Â»r.d the money is gone from our country :
this has occafionefl innumerable law suits, and
many of onr ho-eft 11, d flrious farmers, <vill

*fk,faid Mr. W. if their sppoflt ivs had not car
ried them fufficiently far into difficulties, and if
it was not high time to baufe ? Let us,' as the
gentleman laid from Comie<?Vci)t the o her lay,
reafen together Sox the good of the whole.
The gentltmin from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas)
had coi.eluded his obfervationi, with a good deter
mination ; v.hTch was, that he would defend his
country in e;>f of an invasion. Mr. W observed
that he hi ped every one would do the fame, tho"
he did not iivagine an invasion for the purpo r e of
fiibjugation would take place. What European
nation, said he would come three thousand miles
for such purpcfei Wehave upwards ol Cne mill
ion rejfablicans, who, to repel an enemy, would
embody ; the want of difcipl-ne would be fsppli
ed with the fpiritof'76, and the yeomanry of Our
c untry would come dowfa like a mighty torrent,
an would sweep the bold invader to the deep.
Thefe.ifibilityof our country, Mr. Williams be
lieved. was dsterm -ned to vindicate its rights with
jfirmnr/j, and ca tiva'.e peace with feeurHy, Bxt,
said he, does America wish for war ? God forbid,
if any mc-ani fiiort of thÂ» surrender of our rights,
freedom, religion an.l propeity can purchase peace,
let us do itâhe was lor it. War is to be dreaded :
it was a'tended with a train Of innume
rable evilsâBut rather than to give up all, will
we not unite to repel unmerited infnlts if not
put a flop to ? YesâHe contended tha! a day of
virtuous liberty, was worth an age in bondage.
Gentlemen had said that our government would
eaufe a war with Spain, but how have they been
mistaken ! Our government hid spoke to Spain in
the American language ; they heard, and peace
was the consequence. Had the fame language
been spoken to France, and no freble minorities, no
ideaof tit people viith us, they would also have heard,
and twenty millions would have been saved.
Upon the wholeâlt is not contended, butthat
this house has a right to fix the sums neceflary to
be paid to the miniflert according to their grade,
aid the courts to which they are sent. i his was
the conflitutianal check vetted in the hcufe of rep

we could use the check given us by the constitu

âwhich depredations will probably con- j
tinue at the will and whim of the execu- ,
ti*e of Franceâyet this wbim will be mea- 1 ]
fured by their political situation with the )
neighboring nations. They are fa aceuf- (
torned to viftory and making laws, that ,
there is scarcely any moderation or bounds ,
to theif terms in many safes. England is (
' however, the' only nation that has not as yet j
' received their yokeâPortugal has ratified j
. the late peace, butasfhedid not do it in ,

tion will not be accepted without an addi
tional facrifice or humiliation."
' ExtraS of a letter from a gentleman at Bour- '
dtaux, who had jujf left.Paris, dated Sth
November 1797. 1
Â« Times are very critical here for Amen- (
can affairs, and the arrival of the commis
sioners is of no effeft. I waited on them fc
x veral times at Paris, and the day before I
' ! left it, had a long conference with one of
" ! them, the fulsftance of which I do not think
!i j prudent to pwt in this letter as its fate is un
lf certain; but they are certainly treated with
the hiolt (hameful pegleft. At the fame
time, our commerce is fufferrng in the most
e alarming manner, and you may (hortly ex
:r pest to hear of a vast number of condemna
tions; for although they ftiould be acquitted
in she inferior tribunals, the court of caffa
,] tion will condemn them; ano the decree
c which gives a right to individuals to fit out
1- national (hips will considerably increase their

not been hitherto attacked, by proÂ»ing that France,
under the required condition, will be better able
than Cieat Britain to supply ui with fever a 1 articles,
which the Englilh authoi allots exclusively and form

is'that in 1789, that is to fay, ata period when arts
and manufa&uret did cot present in France the v. it
means and probability of extension which they now
polfrfs. that even in 1789, it was presumable, that
France would not only have the means to supply one

therefore be decided upon according to the circum- n
fiances attending it ; and these circumftacces wili, j
in general, appear from the defcnpti&n accompli-
uy.ng tke application. u
Buddings partly conftruifted of brick or (lone,
arc preferable to those wholly wooder. And in
both cases, the stile of building, how they are oc- (
cHpied, how they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how occupied, are cenfiderations to f
be taken into view. And with refpetft te goods,
thÂ«jr'tendency, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, either {
to commence or to increase an aeeidental fire, and
their liability in such (late to receive damage by (
wet, or'by sudden andhatly removal, or to be (to-

tion of the term of :he policy, without further ex- j
penfe* than the paynent of the premium of the re
newed term, the ciraimftancescontinuing the fame
as they w'ere unrierftaod by the lufurtrs at the time
the former insurance was made ; but the payment
of the premium is efTential to such renewal ; and
if the party, irfured fuffrrs any time to elapfc after
the expir?tiÂ«n of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; Her can the insurance be renew
ed on the former policy but by Computing the
commencement bf the renewal from the expiration
of the former insurance. The fubjeit of insur
ance may neverthelcfs be open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. If any otKer insurance be made on the fame
property ; it mud be made known at the time of
application, otherwise the policy tawde on such ap
plication will be void,
