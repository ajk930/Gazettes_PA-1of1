1. TOULON.
The capture of Toulon by Lord "Hood, forms
one of the mod important incidents of the present
war, and the paititulars ot it are bigljjy iiitereuing
at the present moment. For thit reason we con-
II ceive the following- article, extracted frÂ«m the
y French deputy Ifnaro's answer to Freron, which
throws a'ftrong light 'on the circUmstances that pre
ceded and followed that event, will not prove unac
a ceptable ; at the*''metime this detail may serve as
an answer to the Republicans here, who are apt
to blame the conduit of the Enolift oh that oc
casion :â
" The crime of the yift of May had just been
perpetrated, and the ardest Jlepiiblicans of the
C 3<sutb, enraged at the triurrpo of rhe Mountain,

and it was unable to proetire any bj lea, the pott
being blocked up by theFnglifh. Toulon wat re
duced to the dreadful dilrmma of fufemittinjr cither
'"* to the Mountain or the Englifl), and of furrendtr
ing itfslf either to the mercy of Robefpierre-and
Freron, or to that ef Lord Hood. The former
Â» threatened the-city with fcaffoldt, and the latter
promised to break them down ; the former condrtn
ned ut to famine, and the latter offered to supply
ut with corn. Freron brought the constitution of
1793, diflated by Robefpierte, in the presence of
the executioner, and written with the pureffi blood
of our representatives j Hood proposed
so us to acknowledge the incient work of the con
stituent assembly. Under circumstances, some 1

The author then proceeds to the recapture of

s the following manner ; " The great number of

tious inhabitants fled with the Englifb. The po
pulation of Toulon, which amounted to 28,0e0
j iouls, was reduced to 8000. Pursuant toÂ« Procla
mation of Freron, ordering all good and loyal eui-

The egregious error*contained in this short rÂ«.

of 'the fropo/itieus, introduced by Mr. Madifoit,

intercepted letter, ">Â»* 'L- 1 ivgf^uttior.
It was obvious to those that examined it, Â»hÂ«
the whole object and tendency Â»f the report went
to swell the catalogue of fnppofed injurie*, string
. from the commercial regulation* of Britain, and to
-dimi nish those of France, Spain and Portugal, par,
ticularly the former by oveilooking importantdif.
eliminations in our favor 011 the part of Britain*

hand, the disadvantageous'reftriftiont of the other
nation* were grouped in the back ground and tri
fling preferences brought forward and swelled ina
immense benefit*.
So'eager was the secretary in Ae pursuit of hi*
favorite objefl, vi - 2. to entangle the United State*
1 into altercations with England, which could only
ifTue in war, that he not only advanced in fipport
of kit commercial proportions, theories directly
the reverse of those he had elaborately inculcateditt ,
his Notes 011 Virginia, but he even flatly emtradid* y
id in one page a maxim of government which he bad
emphatically laid down no farther b?.tk tl.ao in the
\preceding page, and dated, with confidence, aw*-
of wo in ji;ir.&<fcras!e"mportanee, which
he wai obliged to centratiiil in hi* fnppkmcr.taiy re

These three charge* will now be detailed aad
fupponted by evidence from Mr. Jeffetfon'* ohi
pen.
1 ft. He advanced in his commercial report the
riet which he had strongly condemned in hi* Ntxt*
on Virginia.
in his Note* on Virginia, pagi 174, he fays,
" Ihe political -econotjiifts of Europe, have elta
blidved it a* a principle, that every state should

n> other*, we transfer to America, without calcu
latiog the difference of circumflances which should

proportion which the aggregate Â»f the tther clnffes of

whereby to measure its degree of corruption. While .
we have land to labour, then, let ui meter wish to

>pli much to the (upfwrt at PUKE government,
as sorf.s do to the strength of the human body."
but ivotwithftanding ijiis explicit condemnation
of the fyrtem of derncflic manufactures for the
United States, in the year 1782, yet in his commer
cial report, in 1793. when precisely the fame causeÂ«
exilted, we find a Rrong recommendation of mea
fbtet, calculated to compel the United States to 1
depend altogether for supply on domcjlic manufac
tures, there being no other nation, at that time, ca
pable of furnifcing them but Great-Btitain, whose
manufactures were to have been interdi&ed.
In that report, page 17,* he recommends the ]
burdening >*th duties or excluding such foreign ma
nufactures at we take in greatejt quantity, and whieh
at the fame time we could the soonest furnilh to our- t
ielves, or obtain from other countries, imposing 011 1
them dutiet, lighter at firft, but heavier and heavier >
afterwards, as othercliknnelt of supply open.. He '
adds, " such duties, having the effedt of irtdircfl en )
eouragement to dotneflic manufactures of the fame '
kind, may induce the manufacturer to come himftlf in
to these ftatet ; and here he in the power
of the flats governments re cu-operate essentially, '
by opening the refourcet of encouiagemeiit, which j
are under their controul, extending them liberally f
to artifls in ihofe jKrtieular bunches of . manufacr
tures, for which rtieir foil, climate, population, and '
other circumfUnces have matured them, and fofier
ing the precious efforts and prog*cfs of hotijehold '
tnanufaflure by some pationage suited 10 the nature '
ef iti objedts, guided by the 1 Aral information they 1
pofiefs, and guarded againit abuse by their prcfencc '
and attentions. The oppreflious on our agricul
ture i(i foreign ports would thus be made the oeca-
fion os-relieving it from a dependance on the conn
Â«ils and conduct of others, an/' promoting arti,
MANUFACTURES AND POPULATION AT HOME." 1
The glaring contradiction which these recited (
paflages exhibit furnifhes scope for feverat remarks: '
Jn the firft place, he hat evidently overlooked or 1
forgotten in the commercial report all the injury '
which, tn his notes, ho had declared to flu* troai c
th* introduction of domestic manufactures into the '
United States; and this it not all j in his notes, e
page 93) "he deprecates the importation of foreign- 0
â¢' ers into the Uniied States, because Â«oming piin-
" cipally from monarchical countries they will either a
" bring their pernicious ttixims, or, if they throw (
â¢' them off, it will be in exchange for Â»n unioun H
" dtd. lutniMujUifi, pmffmjjv nj is -gfanl, fays he, k
*â¢ from one extreme to another," And yer in his n
report he strongly recommends measures, calculated ti
to produce the cffe& of introducing a mals of so- Â®
feigners from that monarchical country, Britain, and f'
the very xoorjl kind us foreigners, in his efiimation, t<
manufacturers a class of people, the proportion of p
which, in society, fays he, furnifhes a barometer C
whereby to measure its degree of corruption.-)- C
When he wrote hi* notes, thit country being at 0
war witk Great Britain, no ftimulut was neceffatx.
to inflame our citizens ; fufljeient causes then exir w
ted, and then " manufadurers were the fourec of tor it
ruption, then foreigners were the fourct of Hccntioyf-
Mfs." But, when he wrote hit report, a quarrel I
with Great-Britain was a defirublc thing ; then it
was uecefiary to inflame the Leg Mature "of the Uni
ted States, then it was proper that foreign manufac
tures fliould be interdicted, that the United States
should manufaSure for themfehts, and riof content

NEW-YORK, November 8.
iu. PERSECUTION.
The Englilh government has ever been censured I
ul, for requiring a tell of her citieens, as a condition J
ia, of eligibility to offiv-es. All liberal men reprobate I
ou -he E.ig.ifh tert law justly, for it flagrant in- j
ad ftingementof the tights of cenfeience, and of no I
ly, morf cOnfequenre to the ficurity of the government I
ve hati whether ihctnglilfc wear cocked hats or round j
ie, hats.
x- 1 lie French, though they join in reprobating the I
i,re English oppreffiun, have fallen into the fame error I
he under another shape. By an order. of the Direflo J
rfe ry, citizens of France arc not to be employed i
<o, public frrvice, unlcfs they fay citizen instead of mon- j
ch Jforrj and by a notice of Mr. Adtt in thucountry, j
n- ft i' ici diraMi is cMt, ied to the privileges of Ftench 1
u- citizens, unlels he wears a tri.coh vred cockade. I
a- Now matters stand thus. Au EngJ&jnan can
ns not enjoy the advantages of office in Great-Britain,
1 without swearing a certain oath, and fubfciibing !
id tan. articles and takingthefaerament. A French-I
0- nan iÂ§ deprived of the lame advantage?, urilefs he j
ot says citizen, and wears, a cockade with three co-I
n. iours. The iwo cases are exaflly similar in princi-l
;d I'le. It is as mucn an aft of tyranny to compel a j
man to wear a cackadc, as it is to compel him to
in repeat certain words. Both are oppreflive, and]
at tend only to make hypocrites without the smallest }
ih security to Government. The prerences in both
:s. cases ate the fameâto keep out of offict all who
â ate not friendly te the exilting government either j
in church or state. The lefult is, that an external
badge, and not principle, becomes the test of a good
and faithful citizen. One is ecclesiastical tyranny,
the other is political republican tyranny ! Rifum te
