HOUSE OF REPKBSmTATIVSS.
Wednesday, January 18â Cominued.
Mr. Craifc's fpeÂ«th continued.
He wag,afraid this view of the fubjcfl had not
fufficiently engaged the attention of #emlemen.
When he read the accounts in theytiblic prints ot
the flagrant att.uk made upon our commerce; when
he not only saw deprecations and spoliations com
mitted, but adual hoftilitiei threatened, he thought
there was serious grouud for alarm.
One of the strong eftobjc&ions to a direst tax was,
that we cou}d not expert immediate revenue from
that fourcc ; but the force Â»f this objection ap
plied with equal fttength to the adaptiop of any
energetic measure. If it required time to m?.ture
this plan, it was necessary to bepn it immediately,
that it might be gradually prepared, and ready
whenever ueceflity (hould impel them to have re
course to it ; for it would be preemption and the
height of folly to suppose, we (liould always be ex
empt from what was the common lot of other na
tions. The propriety of'the measure of enereafing
our revenue, had been agreed on all hands, how
ever gentlemen differed about the mode ef effcÂ£iing
it. It appeared to him essentially necessary toori
ginate/ome plan of diredfc taxation to which the}
might resort. If it be admitted that such a plan
is necefTary, though not to foe carried into immedi
ate effect, the present queftioa ought to be agreed
' t0 "
If he understood the gentlemen from Nsw-York,
; New-Jersey, and South-Carolina, (Mr. Williams,
Mr. Henderfon, and Mr. Harper) all agreed, that
r further revenue was necaflary, and two of the gen
'. tlemen were in favor of originating a plan of direfl
' taxes. The question tÂ«e<i refiilted, to what obji'ft
of direst taxation (hould they apply ? They weie
e an agricultural people, and the great capital of thÂ«
country was in land. If a direst tax then mud be
e laid, land was the proper ebje& for it. He con
-11 lidered that the farmers, notwithftsnding their want
of ready monÂ«y, when compared with the inhabi
tants of cities, as possessed of great part of the
" wealth of the country, and that they ought there
fore to pay their quota of the public taxes. j
It might be necefTary, Mr. Cnik said, to exam
ine fomeoftheobjeftions which hadbeea madeto thii
system. And here he would oblerve that gentle
men ought not toexpeftany thing like perfeftioi
in any scheme of taxation. Taxes were only >
choice of evils ; they were unpleasant, but the;
vrere necefTary. It had been objcdled againltadi
reÂ£t tax, that it was unequal on account of variei;
"â¢ of population, wealth and fituation.âGentk-me
had not been fatisficd with fuppofiog that a bad pla
might be adopted ; they had supposed the ver
worll to be entered into ; that the nffeflors to b
appointed would bethebafeft of men ; but he trufl
ed the committee who was charged with the bus
ness, would have the good sense to prepare such
plaa as ftituld be free from many objections whic
had been bro't againtt it. Mr. Craik differed i
opinion from the gentleman from South Carolir
( Mr. Harper) that this tax would bear hardefl u;
et on the farmeVs far removed from the sea coail. T'
believedrfhey would rather have the advantage th;
y ; otherwile, from the low value put upon their land
h- The expence of collejSioii had been urged as an o
jeftion. He had been much surprized to he
gentlemen calculate that expence, one at fifteen ai
oue at thirty per cent, Hejwoiidert'd that the ge
eialaeeuraey of those gentlemen (hould have suss.
Ed them to have wandered so much from the poi
on this occalion. He believed the eftimarc of t
nth gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin) w
I high at 7 1-2 per cent. An obje&ion of this kii
â** was lels applicable to land, than to taxes on a;
'if- other species of property.
fÂ° r A tax or an heaith-tax, had be
j q "' propofedasa substitute, which would in fact
nothing more than a house tax. He thought tl
j filch a tax was liable to every objcj2ion that coi
be made against a tax on land, and to great ma
others peculiar to thcmfclvcs. Houfcs were
JN e q u ' voca ' representation of propefty, and a tax
them would fall on some parts of the country mu
heavier than on others. Indeed it was fufcepiil
of so many obvious objcÂ£tioiig, that they were r
necessary to be detailed.
Mr. Craik said he did tiot conceive it import;
to go into an enquiry how far it was prudent or |
litic to go to an extent ion of the impost;, r.s he!
110 authority on which to found his opinion ; a
he would caution gentlemen from being diver
ual- frdm the quelfion by a expectation of an encrea
revenue from thence. It had been proved very I
isfa&orily by the gentleman from Pcnufvlva
(Mr. Gallatin) that there no certainty
advance in the imposts. Upon a calculation of
r . duties paid upon goods from the Eafl Indies,
::r - Indies and Europe, they amount at least to fixt
per cent, and were gentlemen prepared to fay t
| even this duty might rot prove a temptation
ant > merchants to become fmuggftrs. The quefl
was an abftrafi principle, and did not pledge Â£
tlemen to this source of taxation only \ if oil
rthe cou ld be found more eligible, they might .be ap
niles ed to. He hoped, therefore, tLe committee Wc
dÂ» a find no difficulty in agreeing to tlii proportion
idasÂ« f ore them.
Mr. W. Lyman said a land tax had always t
/illi- COB f'deied as an impolitic tax. It would be we!
erms enquire why this tax (hould have been so c'oAl?
sale, ed ; whether the whole world had erred in'
lie m ca f c) or there was some natural cause for the o
( ion., A tax on land was calling forth property
mak- fo,e ' l wss produced j for, until land was cultiva
it produced nothing. To call for a tax in this
lants' had also a tesdency to difcÂ»uragc thecultivatio
â¢ No - land.
2 bc Mr. L. said, he admitted that the consumer

merchant, but from the person who purehafed
Â£ goods for consumption. it the person
*Â£> cultivated the ground who paid a direst tax on lj
but those who bought the produce of the land I

cafe as well as|the other.

cess, he said, was unerring and certain. They were
fa much so, that an eminent wrttsr 0.. the fubjeft y
had said, it was Â» pay the debt to government, or pay wou
the debt to nature/The tax mult be paid, or the Â«th<
person mult cease to exill. -- â¢
When he contemplated the fubjeft in this poin
of view, and if he weft tight* that direst taxes were the,
paid by'-the as well as indirect taxes, he t e c
could nJt be at a loss what vote to give on tne pre-
{ent Â©ccafion. . ~ â r
in whatever joint of view he co* idered direst be^
taxes, they could not, in his opinion, be compared
with indirect taxes. It was true, that some nidi per
reft taxes, and all taxes in a greater or lei<s degree, proc
were unpopular; but this never happened bat when any
they were pushed too far. An impott or an excise 1 oppi
may be so exceflive as to be incommodious; but fore
this, he said, was not the nature of the tax. ' IC
This, hefyd, was not the cafe with a diretl, or He
land tlx. This, though ever so small was paid un- oth<
willingly ; a poll-tax was the fame. And a man that
called upon to pay a poll-tax, did not ultimately pay won
the tax ; for a poor man who earned only jult fuf- dec!
ficient for his existence, would cease to exilt, it he all
were not to make a proportionable advance en his htu;
, , taxa
labour. .
In what situation was government ? It calls up- tree
on a man tÂ» pay a direst tax,'perhaps unable to pay wilt;
it. This mode, he said, was circuitous, unfafe.and our
not to be relied upon.
This reflection convinced him, that this cauntry oe c
bad chosen indiredt taxes as the best possible mode, beln
He thought it had made a wife choice. He knew that
very well thst a cafe might be Rated in which a di- dciÂ£
reft tax would be neceflary. A cafe might be (iip
pofed in which every thing might be put in requifi- t ""'
lion. But that was not the present question. In und
cafe of an invalion, or a war, it might be neceflary
to put both property and persons in a (late of re- ject
quifition. He would not pretend to fay, that, in tern
such a situation, direst taxes, or any other, would reai
1 not be proper ; but, in noothet situation, could he fed
â¢ think such a tax should be called for. trei
1 Some gentlemen, oppofei! to the adoption of a tha
' direst tax at present, were of opinion that they wa
' Ihould at leall agree upon a plan of direst taxation we
â  which might be ready in cafe of emergency. But no'
f he did not think such a proceeding neceflary, or wil
I that it would answer any good purpose. He bc-
II lieved it would never be necessary to go into the thi
1 buhnefs, except in an extreme cafe. He therefore hai
e did not think it worth while ; for, however well a â¦ thi
- plan might now be laid, it might be unfit to be ac- lar
1- ted upon when it was wanted. Whoever might all
a compose the legislature at such a time, they would fei
h doubtless be able to determine what was necessary. foi
n He was not for anticipating legiflatios in that way. pi
14 B.fides these general observations, which were of
>- applicable to all countries, there was one which ap ca
'e plied-particularly to the United Slates. If a di
nt reft lax was laid, it mult be according to the lalt L
s. ceafutt. In this way the tax would fall very une- ir
3- qually ; for, it would be found that the population an
ar in some parts of the United States exceeded that ac
'd of other part 6in proportion to the extent of terri- fa
n- j lory, anÂ» wealth and produCtivenelsot foil. Where- fr<
r- | ver commerce had extended to'a confiderahle de- di
nt j gree, the landed interett would be taxed on account in
116 los the population which those improvements may tl;
as have produced. Population, was, perhaps, as sure io
id a mean of judging as ally other of the ability to o!
iy pay of any diftrift ; but from the situation of the la
United States it was not, he said, a good criterion M
en at present. b
be Coming from oie Itatehe did, he should be obli
at ped, it he did not generally object to the system of si
i'd direst taxation, to objcA to it on that account. He !tl
"y did uet think a dirÂ«6t tax could comport with the a
as into eft of a populous (late. )f gentlenhen thought v
on Inch a lax would fall heavy or unequal in thinly in- u
habited llates, he mud-give up his argument, but he
jle did not btlieve this could be the cafe. c
He might have said that indirect taxes were indivl- ! t:
dually unequal, unless upon the principle that con- ' \
int fumers pay the duty. It was not in human wist
jo- dom to lay a direst tax equal. But it was said, 1
iad that money mult be had ; that there was a defieien- j
nd Â«y. in the revenue, and therefore this tax must be ,ti
ed laid. Several gentlemen, he said, had proved that f
fed there might be considerable retrenchments, made in f
at- the puolic expenditure ; peihaps enough to make 1
ma the receipts equal to the expenditures. They had 1
an not yet determined how fai the military and naval :
the j eftablilhment might be curtailed, and several other ! s
eft j articles of expence would admit of retrenchment, t
Â«n | Betides, if that, were not the cafe, and the sum in t
hat ; question must be raised, he thought there were cert
to tain articles of importation which would admit ofa <
ton hightr duty, and which would not only prod Ace rÂ«- i
tu- Venue, but operate as an encouragement of the ma- 1
ters uufailures of our own country. ]
pit- It would be recollected, Mr. L. said, that peti
u c tioos had bea> received from hat and glass manu J
e- tacturers, and various wthers, praying for an aug
mentation of duty ou thoft articles, as they found
een the preient duty not a fufticient proteftioH to their
ta maiiuUdure,. Indeed the fnanufafture, of the U-
Jer- nitedl States were almost wholly abandoned. Thole
this of glass and of woollens were abandoned those of
pin- cotton, which had progressed to some extent, had,
e in a considerable degree, been abandoned, and some
ted, others were likely to be so. Ec*his pait, he tho't

Let the duty be what it would on perter, on coal,
and almost on hats, there need be no fear of fmuir
gling.
There was another article. He believed the
duty on rutn imported might b<i increased. It
would have one of two good effeÂ£ts; ; t
either produce more revenue, or less would be con
sumed.
Mr. L. said, he Humid, therefore vote against
the principle, as it was not possible so to detail it as
to comport wiih the interests of the country ;
Bffides that it was not neceffory to referf to this
article of taxation, us the imports and excise might
be so regulated as to produce revenue fulncient.
The article of fait had beertmentioned as a pro
per article for an additional duty. He knew it was
productive: but it could never be the ifitereft of
any country to tax fait ; he thought it the *io(t
oppressive that could be laid. He would not, there
' fore, be underftoed to fay, that in voting against a
diieCt tax, that he meant to vote for a tax on fait.
He thought, indeed, that there wsre f>matiy
other articles whieh would admit a higher duty,
that there was no neceflity for resorting to that. It
would leally be an extraordinary thing, if, af; er
declaring this country free and profperojis eyoud
all. calculation, it (hould be brought into such a
lituation, as that nothing could save it but direCt
taxation. He fondly hoped, he said, we were a
free, enlightened and flourifhing country. He
wished he could fay that the government had used
our peculiar advantages to the bed parpafe; but
everyone viewing the proportion before them, must
be of a different opinion. We mull, said he, either .
believe the United States are not prosperouS, Â©r
that the natural eaufes of our prosperity had been
defeated. -, - . â ; i
Mr. tr-ftrtflf lie "dtff not, mean to take longer
time of the committee, the fubjeCi having already
undergone a very copious difcufiion. /
Mr. Findley hoped the tax, which was the sub
jeCt of their diffusion, had been so long in con
templation, that members would have been more
ready to have met it. It was admitted the laCt
feÂ®on to be necessary, and the secretary of the
treasury had been direCted to report a plan. At
that time they were convinced more revenue waa
wanted ; that by anticipations, and other caufis,
we were in a filiation to require a direCt tax ; but
no& they heard that the iS was impiaCticable, un
wise, impolitic and unjust. *
He objeCted to its being impracticable ; indeed
this had rather teen suggested than proved, and he
had been surprised to hear such a charge. To fay
11 that so important a thing as the laying of a tax on
. land was impracticable, was a moll extraordinary
t assertion ; but he trulted, as it had been found per-
I fedtly practicable in most of the (tates, it \yould be
. found practicable with us. It had been perfectly
. practicable, and most effectual, he said, in the (late
; of Pemifylvania ; and if so there, why not practi
cable in the present cafe ?
The gentleman from Maffachufetfs (Mc. W.
t Lyman) had said that in some parts of the coun
. try the people were more numerous than in others';
i and that a direCt tax would call upon them to pay
t according to their numbers. Were not the manu
facturers, he said, who might pay tjiis, exempted
from the impost duty, (which would be equal to the
diriCt tax which they -were called upon to pay ; and
t indeed if they were no! called upon lor a direCt tax \
y they would pay no tax at all. But with refpeS to
e individual injury, he said it would beasjult as any
0 other tax ; the principle was more jult, becaule
ie land would be taxed only in proportionVu its value.
n No inditeCt tax would operate equally, but would , ,
be more unequal than this.
i- But it was laid this tax would fall upon theeoru
jf i sumÂ«r 4 only. He differed in opinion from the gen
ie ; tlenwn from Massachusetts in this respect. 'Wraith
ie and industry, he said, mult pay taxes. Indultry
it was the cause of wealth. A lax may be levied
n- upon the poll ; but it mult be paid out of wealth.-'
ie But it was said wealth could not be found ; it
could not be found, it v/f/f true, in t
ri-1 hut in thole in which it w.is visible and ex-poled.
n- I Was there a greater mass of wealth than land i cer
if- i tainly not. It was said that it'difcouraged cultiva
d, lion ; but it did no such thing.
n- ! Mr. F. said, Pennfylvsnia had always been in the
be habit of collecting direCt taxes, whiilt a culidv, and
at since. This tax had the effeSt to prevent the land
in from being engrossed, and kept it in fmnll iraCis.
ka DireCt taxes were not imputed until indircCt taxea
ad had been tried to the greateii extent.
iral Mr. F. said there were greater landnj t dates thaa
ler i any other ; and why should they ci'. ;Â« a sax. It
it. could not be supposed that he could advo ate. this
it) tax from any other motive than pri'tuple, (nice
er- the whole of his property and that of iris conltitu

re- jult and equal tax. It is nÂ»t unpopular ; we think.

he said, paid for every thing they eat, driiÂ«k, o*

lg- not obJeCt to a lmall tax or. their land.
Mr. F. fiid he had observed a i.onteft in that
house between the agricultural and trading interests,
thought-it was 100 early a-day tn have iÂ»-
troi'ilced that kind of fpiiit. If they lock a vie*
of the countrry, or of the members in that house,
they found one or the other almost altogether agri

Was it not a little surprising, he said, IÂ»fee the
members of that heufe, whose estates were mostly h;
in land, so desirous of avoiding a land-tax ? How ol
would this look to the people ? Would it not ap- bi
pear as if they were determined to put off the bur- le
den from their own shoulders?
For his part, he was so convinced, from moral
and political ground, of the neceflity and policy of
the meafur'e, thathefhould vote for thf resolution.

PHILADELPHIA,' February 16. t
James Rofs Esq. is chosen Senator of the Uni- 'J
ted States, by a majority cf 18.
In Senatt Â»f the United States,
February IJ, 1797- \
On request, the Vice Preftdent of the United Â«
States being excufcd from further attendance in Se
nate during the feffian, addressed them as follows:
Gentlemen of the Senate,
If, in the general apprehension of an intention to ,
retire in that most eminent citizen, to whom all â
eyes had been directed and all hearts attracted, as a
the center of our union for so long a period ; the "
public opinion had exhibited any clear indications '
of another, ia whom our fellow citizens could have
generally united ; as soon as 1 read that excellent t,
address which announced the neceflity of delibera- J
tion in the choice of a President, I should hare imi- 1
tated the example of a charaÂ£ter, with-which I had !''
co-operated, though in less conspicuous and im- c
portant stations, and maintained an uninterrupted z
friendfhip for two and twenty years. But as anum- t
ber of chara&ers appeared to stand in the general '
estimation, so nearly on i level, as to render it dif- L
ficult to on which the majority would 'j
fall; considering the relation in which I flood to 1 c
the people of America, 1 thought it most refpeift- i
ful ko them, and most conducive to the tranquility J
â¢f the public mind to resign mylelf with others, a j '
silent fpeftatorof the general deliberation and apis- â 
five fubjeft of public difeufiions.
Deeply penetrated with gratitude to my coun- ' I
trymen in general, for their long continued kind- ! '
ness to me, and for that fteadjf and affeÂ£ling con- ; '
fidence, with which those who have moll intimately \
known me, from early life, have on so many great ' t
occasions, entrulled to me, the eare of their dear- >
eft interests ; since a majority of their ele&ois, tho'
a very small one, have declared in my favor, and
since, in a republican government, the majority
though ever so small rauft of neceflity decide, I
have determined at every hazard of a high but just
Tefpontibility, though with much anxiety and
diffidence, more to engage in their service.â
Their confidence which has been the chief consola
tion of my life, is too precious and fa-.-red a depo
litever to be considered lightly. As it has been
founded onlv on the t4ie heart, ir never
has hcep, it never can be, deceived, betrayed, or
forfeited by me.
It is with reluctance, and with all those emoti
ons of g'atitude and affeftiun, which a long expe
rienee i f your goodness ought to inspire that I now
retire from my feat in this House and take my
leave of the members of the Senate.
I ought not to declare, for the last time, your
adjournment, before 1 have prefented'to every Sena
tor prefeut, and to every ciuzen who has ever been
a Senator of the United my thanks, for
the candor and favor invariably received from them
all. It is a recolledtion, of which nothing can ever
deprive me, and it will ba a source of comfort to,,
vÂ«r>e, through the remainder of my life, that, as on
the one hand, in a government cotrllituted like ours,
I have for eight years held the second situation un
der the constitution of the United States, in perfefl
and uninterrupted harmony with the fii ft, without
envy in one, or jealoufv in the other : fa un the
other hand I have never had the fmallelt mifunder
-1 Handing with any member of the Senate. In all
the aullrufe queftt'ons, difficult conjun&ures, dan
gerous emergencies, and animated debates upon the
great intcrefts of our country, which have so often
anii.fo deeply impressed all our minds, and interest
ed the strongest feelings of the heart, I
perienccd a uniform politeness and refpe& froÂ»i
every quarter of the house. When questions of
Ho leL importance than difficulty, have produced
H difference offentiment (and differences of opinion
will always be found in free affemoiies of men, and
probably the greatefl diversities upon the grcateft
questions) when the Senators have been e
qually divided, and my opinion has been demand
ed according to, the constitution, I have constantly
found, iw that moiety of the Senators, from whose
judgment I have been ohliged to uiffent a difpofi
tioa to allow me the fame freedom of deliberation
ano independence of judgment which they asserted
for themfelvei.'
Within thtfe walls, for a course of years, I have
been an admiring witness of a lucceflion of infor
mation, eloquence, patriotism and independence,
which, at they would have done honor tÂ» any Se
nate in any age, afford a cbnfolatory (if the
Legislatures of the States are equally careful in
their future selections, which there is no reason to

LONDON, Decembfr io.
By the laii arrival from Paiis we are given to
unceriiand that the future progress of the
tion cannot be made so public as the previous flcps i
have been. It is said tfcat Lord Malmcfjury iirti- I
mated to M. de la Croix,
" That he had afluranee of being authoiiied to La
propose fp'ecific tcrfns of conceifion, but that his |
Britanic Majedy did not think that the ohjeil ot
the negotiation was Kkely to be prumoterf by the ha- I
bit of publifhingthe official communications on both
fides, thereby exciting the pafiions of the public on I
the tppicsin difcuflion before they were maturely
weighed. It was his desire, therefore, to suggest ..
the prudence of abstaining from this practice so new
iÂ» this diplomacy, and to recommend that the fpe- I
cific terms ofconccffion Â«n both fides fliould be con- I
cealed until she proportions had undergone, at ieaft, I
a fair and uninfluenced difculfion." j ,
The answer of the Directory to the foregoing
fut>eeftion is liated to have been to tlfe following .
effea: , . lel
" That they bad chosen the concourse of public I
difcufiion, that all the world might be made par-
ties to the negociation, and judge between the two
governments ; but if was the desire and taftc of the
English court to prefer a close deliberation, they 1P c
could havrf no obje&ions."
It appears from the account by this chanral, that .
tranquility is. at length reflored to the counting that
were foase time since declared to be out of the
king's peace. The winter, in the filter kingdom, nt
has set in with very unulual rigor.
The whig club in Ireland, after a mature inquiry a 1
into the (late of the reprelentation of the people
in parliament, have refolvid, that'they are of opin- w
ion that, for the purpose of giving to the people V*
thcirj due and conditutional (hare in the legislature,
a reform in parliament is indifpenfibly necessary, and
that the emancipation of the Roman catholicks
should make a fundamental and essential part of the
fame ; and that they consider tbofe measurer as like
ly toeftablith public fatisfa&ion and tranquility, and
promote an union in support of king and countty. ta
Yelleiday advices were received at the admiralty, Q j
of the loss ot the Undaunted frigate, of 40 guns,
which foundered in a gale of wind on the Jamaica ej
Italian, but all her crew were fortunately saved. ej)
MONEY SENT TO THE EMPEROR.
The money fefit to the Emperor is ta be colleft
rd out of two diftiuA papers laid upon the table of 0

NEW-YORK, February Is. â¢
In the London Morning Herald, we find the
following article, cxsiaftcd from a French paper
called L'Ami deS Loix.
â¢ I.eydcn, November 7.
' In the fitting of the Batavian National
ventic.i of the 3d, a letter was read friim citixen
Noel, miniiler of the French republic, by whichÂ»
on the part of the Executive Dire<ftory, he- makes
the following communication i
Â«' That as the negociation commenced with lÂ»rd
Malmefbury at Paris, appeared to have a tendency ,
tÂ» a general PEACE ; and, as the Direflory, ia
all the treaties hitherto concluded, had conllantly
had at heart, the interests of the Batavian republic, >
they invited the National Alfembly to name a per
son invested with the neceflaiy powers to condudt
the intertfts of the Batavian republic, in the pre
sent negociation." ,
Â« The letter adds, that in such circumstances,
the two republics ought to afiilt each other mutu
ally by councils as well as actions, and it was there"
fore wilhed that the perfoo appointed for this im
portant purpose might repair as speedily as poTUble
to Paris.
â¢ It was dacreed that the coremifiion for foreign
affairs (hould arffwer this letter ; and at tbe fame
time make known to Mr. Noel, that the perfoni
nominated and authorised for this purpose, were
aitizens Leftevenon, Pa (leer and Meyeur, who ate
already at Paris.' ,
Upon the above it is obvious to remark, that
whatever may be thought of the sentiments cobÂ«
tained in the official correspondence between lard
Malmefbury and Charles de la Croix, it is aaALtr
the opinion of tbe Dire&ory, that Peace will pro
bably cnlue from the present negociation.
NEW-YORK, Febroary 13.
The bill for felling the 6 per cent and deferred
flock of the United States, belonging to the State,
to the Bank of New York, has pal Ted the Hoiifa
of AfTembly by the large majority ot 67 to 17.
It has pulled in the mode, originally proposed |
excepting that the treafmrer or comptroller is te be,
ex officio, one of the dire&ors.
The bill will no doubt also pass the Senate.

The Telegraph, a London oppefition print of

" The people of France (however faltidious the
I Dite&ory seems in its treaty tor peace) are very
1 anxious to terminate the war. Lord Malmefbury
1 went lately a little way from P ris to a dinner tÂ»

New-Haven, O(Sober 7, 1796.
Dear Sir,
I fhouÃhsve written you last wetfk, had I then been
able to afceruin certain fa6ts, liic rumour of which I had
heard. A Mrs. Beers, a near neighbour to me, the wife
of Eben Beers, and daughter of captain Samuel.Hoggins,
of this town, had been, for fourteen weeks, exceedingly
diftrelTed with the Rheiimatifm, to such a degree that for
fourteen weeks previous to the 29th ef last month, she -
had not been able to v. alk acrois the room t w;i with crut
ches, lave only ones, when (he made out with the'afiift
ance of crutches to hobble part of the way aero's her room..
On the 2'; th.of September last, ihe procured a set of your
metallic substances, and in lefs-than, an hour after Ihe had
begun to use them,.in the marines directed by you, Ihe
rose from her chair, and walked about hsr house, and on T
. the next day she went abroad to her neighbours, having :
thrown afidc her ciutdips. 1 have this day paid her.a visit 11
in company with her father, and Timothy Jon t. Esq.
who lives in the street wh.'re she resides and direetiy op- Â° J
pofit-. to her rafideuce, and with Capt. Abel Burrett, who Â£:
is her next neighbor, and live* within eight yards .of ljer
d'oor. I requested hfr to relate her cafe over in their -Ti
presence, which flic did, and theft,gentlemen all with one -
voice, supported, from their own knovyledge, her flory. .
It is a duty which you owe yourfelf and'the world to pro- "
this event. â¢ I am, very refpedfully, a '
Your .obedient frrvant,

Rev. Mr. Spalding, of Salem. U
Tl. t'.iay certify, that the fu'ufcriber, inhis visits amoti"
his people, ha,s used Dr. Perkins's metallic paints, to r.c>
lieve-pains and inflammations of virious kinds, and has
succeeded to his astonishment. They have seldom failed m
to relieve the head-achâ tseth-ach, ague in the face, in
flammation in the eyes, cramp, cholic, rhtumatifm, oains
of the breast and fid j, biles, scalds and burnsâSometimes ' a
there has been a perfect cure ir.nji one operation. A lad
Vvhohad been confined three da/s with.h'gh symptoms of C i
a fever, very hwt and full of pain, by an operation of the
points, designed to relieve his head, his face turned pale
and cold 1 , his fever and pain immediately ltft him, and in
a tew days he was out of doors ; the year before, at the
fame season, he was taken with the fame symptoms, and T
â lay extremely sick forty days. The efficacy of the metal
l.*c (joints has gained great credit in this town.

Rev. Elhanan Winchester.
I certify, that on the zift of Marchil 7*96, I s a w Dr. in
Perkins's method of rure by pointed metallic inflrumcnts, aa
tried with success in the poor-house or bettering-houfe in
Philadelphia; efpeciaily npen a man who was unable to
lilt his right hand to his head, as was tried beforehand, but
who after a few minutes operation, was able to remove it j* 1 '
at pleafurc.j and in my fight, put it witheafe on the top j} 3
of his head and back of his neck', and in all directions.
Nearlj the lame eile& took place.upsn a woman ; and
all that I saw treated, profelfed that their pains >-eased "Y
after being treated a fhorr time : and f'everal came volun
tarily, and in my hearing thanked the Dr. foi; cures he thl
h\J performed on them about eight weeks before, in re- 011
moving .pains fr,.m them, which they dÂ«fared had not
since returned:âso that from what I saw with my own
eyes, and what lhave heard, I'hajtf great hopes that this
methed will greatly tend to alleviate the miseries of man- â  H

Dr. Perkins s invention for removing pains from the
human body, begins to obtain reputation in proportion -
to its utility and efficacy. The finiplieity of the operati- p

too powerful to be refiftÂ»d.
