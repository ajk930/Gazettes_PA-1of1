The Physicians ard Surgeons of the j X
Military Hospital in BafTe-terre, Guada- f

ras to have carried this curioiity to France j r
ras taken by. the Englidi, and the box was j Q
lent to the' Medical Society of London. Â«
This Sooiety, considering it tkeir duty to t
jrward the box to the mllitution for which i v
had firft been intended, transmitted it U> I d

From Rujjel's Gazette*
ONE of the wised ever adopted
y our general governmeat, is that by which
e are difcoime&ed with the perfidious
' renik nation, whose of punic
, lith, generally applied to her under the
lOÃarc y, has been so firmly established by
â¢ cr conduct fiuce flTe adumed the republi
in formâa form so unsuitable to her fri
)lous disposition, that no change of con
ud will ever alter it. Duplicity has been,
id >-ver will be a leading trait in the poli
â¢-â¢alcharactterofherrulers; whetherapcpular
â  monarchical government prevails. Of
' lis the whole world has long been convinc
- 1, and every day's itittrcowrf? with them
e mfirms the fadt, by evideuce too power-
Ky demonllrative to be resisted. The
uited States in particular have reaf >.i to
>ow it. Ever since the detestable French
volution, bave the agents of that na ion,
as vcÃ at home Â« here, been pmfiling (lep3
invariably militatniff agau-ft our welfare 5c
tranquility. To the flrtuotis fH*mtiefs of
our government alone it U that we are in
debted for a ontiansnco if our political
exidencr, and not to the hollow profefljons .
of a set of hypocrites, or their partizans Fai
us, the treacherous [udas's of Ame- w]
rica ; who, for money, or from predileftion
to a hostile nation.would betray.their coun- iâ,
try's bed interests into the hands of her mod
inveterate enemy.
It was to be expefted that Talleyrand, Ju
t and the other members of the Freiwh go-
vernment, wou'd endeavour to (hist the -Â£*b
blame of a rupture, from fheir owa (houlders Tt
upon us. They hare represented our com
miffiouers as inaccessible, and intrenching A[
themselves in etlqurtteâwhile it is known
that every effort ihey made to be received, N<
wi3 fruitlcfs. Wearied at last with a series N<
of indignity and humiliation, to which the
envoys of no other nation tinder heaven sh
â  would have submitted, they have quit the Ht
inh.ofpitable foil, and except one, all fafe. in Fo
, Americaâand now, this hypocrite Talley- J
I rand, and hi< coadjutors in iniquity, are
f labouring to establish an opinion, that the A ,
r whole blame of failure is ours! No man, but i' (
t a blind jacobin, or a venal (lave, can be im- W
> posed on by attificts so gross; and none >
- but villains accuftouied to praAice the vilefl w
, arts, and to cram the mod evident abfurdi-, W
ties down the throats of others in their pow-1 n.
. er, could expeft to be creiiitcd when assert- _
, ing faldioods so palpable. Yet, after all the j
- provocations they are continually accumu- T l
:, lating on us, they profefs a desire to live in T

The compleat drftruflicm bt-<fic French fleet
>n is confirmed by ntunbei of late informations.â
fe Tfti stli of August the English' fleet overtook
.; r the Freach fleet in the svaters of Caudta. Nel
an son having previou!ly dispatched some of his
â veflels, had but 13 fail. f the line ; while Buo
' napatte's fleet confiftei* Â»f 17. Two days the
30 fleets were usable to come to an aflion, it being
a dead calm. On the S.h the wind Mowed frefh
Â»r- trom the westward, when the Hnglilh admiral
[| broke the French line and cut oft' g vcfielj, one
Â«Â»f which was the admiral's veifcl, the L'Orient
ir _ of iÂ»s s uns > on board of which was general
Buonaparte. After a terrible battle, in which
ia Nelfya was mortally wounded, the 8 French
e y veflels were taktn, and Buonaparte had to de
ch liver up to Nell'on his fwwrd, as a prisoner of
les war. When the EngliOl learned the dfath of
to their admiral they got enraged and no quarters
ier were given ; thus numbers of transport lhips
j were funk, the other flying French veflels were
purfutd, and the nthof (uly the Englilh ef
j fected a great ainongtt them,
in
ie- Venice, Auguf! 10.
sts Six French frigates, who elcaped the fate of
Jt, the Touion fleet, havearrivrd in Moreu, in a
moll shattered condition, and totally unfitted for
ailion. In other harbors of ths Mediterranean
have likewise arrived several damaged French
veflels of wj-. Some French veflels arrived at
Candia, and all their crews and officers Vere im
:he mediately killed by the inhabitants,
ich Immediately after the aiSlion, the fiaglilh took
pofleffion of the island of Carigo.
During the ad\ion Buonaparte had three re
inforcements of men brought on board the
L'Ortent, from which may be concluded how
i;reÂ»t the slaughter on board his <hip mud have
:ry been.
Buonaparte expreiTed himfelf frequently dur
ing the aflion ; such 1 cannonade J dio never
)u t hear in my life. The misfortunes of the French
< a | fleet may in agi eat meafnrc, bt ascribed to their
r' veflels being manned with a rabble of Mjlte
's> fians, Venetians, Romans, Cifalpines, &c. who
not knowing or minding their duty, thus con
tributed to the onfuccelsful event,
