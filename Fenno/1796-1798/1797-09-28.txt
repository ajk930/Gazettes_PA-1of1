An Ordinance authori/ing the Mayor to lor

J WHEREAS great numbers of the in
ef. habitants of the city of Philadelphia have

; SAMUEL HODGSON,
Preft dent of Common Council.
FRANCIS GURNEY,
President of SclcÃ Council.
The following is from a correspondent :
" I observe that the editor of the Aurora
is at open hostility with you. I wish that
in the paragraph wÃch appears to have in
curred his wrath, you had substituted people
for ting ; for certainly no nation have been
so completely tricked out of their own (i. e.
rights) as the French."
The former is a very natural wish, and
the.latter a very just remark. But the rea
son why the one exprcflion was not adopted
rather than the other, was, on acequnt of a
belief, that the only means by which tie peo
ple could again, in any degree, be restored
to their own, is through the medium of the
restoration of the king ; and becaufc this is
believed to be the wish of nine-tenths of the
people of France, tho' prevented from being
exprefled witn its due force by the art and
villainy of the other tenth. And every
man will coincide in this opinion, who, from
having attended to the French revolution,
has seen, as every such man must have seen,
that all the leading measures of the revolu
tion, m. Â«11 >Â«Â« J>een efEedÂ«4-
against the opinion of a solid majorityâby
art, by chicanery, deception, and by terror.
The French have pretty plainly shewn, by
a&ual and horrible experiment, that they are
wholly unfit for, and cannot sustain, a free
government, in any tolerable degree. And
a speedy re-eflablifhment of a king, can
alone prevent the renewal of those bloody
scenes of and carnage which have
already desolated that thriving empire.
In this view every philanthropic mind mud
heartily pray for the event.
Who this king may be is a matter of
very little consequence, so that he be not a
log or a tiger ; let it be any body but the
foi-difant Louis XVIII. whose principal aim
seems always to have been to get as far as
poflible from the reach of that " villainous
thing called gunpowdet."
[Many other reflections here present
themselves : but a prefTnre of various em
barraflments prevents, at present, any further
enlargement. As the progress of things in
France will, in all probability, repeatedly
renew the fubjeft, the opportunity cannot
be considered as gone by.]
Trcnflatedfor the (N. T.J Gazette,
From a worl written by Lovis-AbÂ£l-Bet?-
sor-Rtiaur,called the " Te/lament of anE
leSor of Paris."
It was published immediately after the
conflict between the people of Paris and the
conventional army, on the fubjeft of forcing
the present constitution down thelthroats of
the people, notwithstanding their weighty
and just abhorrence of that part of it which
fays that two thirds of the members of the
new body shall be taken from the old butch
ering convention. Its.analogy to the char
after and views of the direC ory who is the
foul of the terrorist party, will apologize for
its translation and pnblication at the present 1
awful and interesting crisis.
"Of all the feourges, which hell has vo- j
mited on the earth, since its existence, it is
neceflary to be destitute of sense not to al- ,
low that the tuoft terrible, fatal and execra- :
ble, is the revolutionary government. It is <
precisely what the prince of latin poets ap- 1
peared to prtfage to future generations in
this celebrated verse, wkich paints in true (
colirs what is* or rather what would be the 1
revolutionary government of the French."
MoNSTRUM, HORRENDUM, INFOR ME,
'INGEVS, CUI lUMEN ADEMPTUM ! :
Monflrum. " There never was a pheno- f
menon more monstrous than this atrocious J
invention, this hideous child of frantic crime. (
It is neceflary to have seen it to have belier- ]
ed in its existence. It is not only out ef na- 1
ture and againfl nature, but it is out of the '
class of things which it is poflible for man '
to conceive out of nature and againfl na- '
ture." t
Horrcndum. " The horror which it was ,
capable of inspiring and which in eifeft it %
did infpice, was such, that we cannot think
of it without (liuddering, and Our posterity
a thousand years hence will hardly have cou
rage enough to pronounce its name. I
have seen whole families tremble as from a
violent fit of the fever and ague, shiver in
all their fall into convulsive motions,
â  iven when talked of before them. If it nfi s
pofllble to aflemble in one single frame, eve
ry horrible thing that the 1 world has pro
duced since its creation, this chief-d'cetivre
â  ugliness and deformity would be less
(hocking than the single idea of the revolu
â  .tiopary government. It alone has made more
enemies, irrec#ncileable enemies to
than every thing that could otherwise have
> been deviled to hasten her deftrudliou." Â»
Informc. " All that the perversity, de
pravity, and pride of the wicked could invent
of what was absurd, ridiculous, udforme'd,
extravagant, flioicking, revolting, that
the jmnlenfe Aore4ioufe of human follies
could offer of inconceivable atrocity in silli
ness, in extravagance and ih stupidity, it* far
from coming up to the revolutionary govern
ment. For who government, fays abftnee
of revolution ; and he who fays revolutionary
government, fays trfyfraaion of every kind of
government, and fays even much more ; /or
it fignifies, in ever)' sense of the words, the
organization of disorganization, the systema
tizing coldly all foiÂ« of crimes, and draw
ing up a plan of chaos. It is the-ne plus
ultra of folly, ignorance, and ferocity ; and
heaven no doubt has been willing to fee how
far human natnre could bear away the palm
of infamous-cruelty over the infernal spirits."
[tfgens. "It was a coloiTus of deformity,
an enormous mass of absurdities and abomi
nations of every kind, an ( immense pyramid
ofxrimes of evfry fpecies,of which the regis
ters of hell could not contain the simple
nomenclature. This dreadful colossus ap
peared to have one foot on one hemisphere
of the globe and one foot on the other;
like the famous coloflus of the island of,
Rhodes, between whose legs pasTed ships of
the line. It extended, its rapacious hands
to every thing it fofye&ed to be hofleft and
virtuous u rider heaven ; its steeled claws
would plunge themfelves|into every thing }
stab, as we may fay, the two worlds to des
troy them at the fame time. Its open
mouth threatened to swallow the univcrfe ;
and its empoisoned breath vomited a deadly
plague over all the furface of France. It
was a ghastly horrid wolf, whofÂ« ferocity
would not have spared any living bein-", if
heaven, touched with companion for poor
fuffenng humanity had not finally fupprefTed
the violence of his rage."
Cut lumen ademptum. "In effeft, the in
stant that xhe revolutionary government took
existence in France, was the epoch the most
dark of our history; the fun enlivens no
more the territory of France, but with a
brightness fictitious and precarious. The
father of light appears to bury himfelf with
us in an eternal night; or rather, be concen
trates himfelf in the sphere of his immortal
rays, and hides himfelf from us, the better
to isolate as from-all natures works. All
the splendor, all the brilliancy of the universe
was taruifhed ; every thing died with the
reaftnr of mÂ«Â« t <*ci-f thing difappÂ«ared
with bis happiness ; all was destroyed ; the
most noble portion of humanity perished ;
and'the foul, which ennobled our existence
plunge'd itfelf in the fight of its nothingness.
He who created the revolutionary government
'acquires imprescriptible right* to the exe
cration of his cotemporaries, to the sovereign
contempt of posterity and to the never-end
ing punishments of eternity. Sis name
(hall be consigned to the bloody and livid
history of barbarity. This monster, the
day of his creation said to the French na
tion,
" Frenchmen, to prove to you how much
I despise you, and to. give to you an idea of
the pleasure I feel in humiliating and vex
ing you, I am going to command anarchy
in the name of the law, folly in the name
ofreafon, atheism in the name of God Â»and
you will obey! You will applaud Â«hc !"
" Every thing I hive said as the revolu
tionary government I have thought and still
think ; I have felt and still feel. But, how
ever energetic my manner of exprefiing my
fclf may appear to you, it falls short of the
reality iÃafmÃch as the reptile is below the
eagle ; and when I shall be in pofTefljon of
Pandora's box, should I open and exhaust
it, there would not go out of it a monster
more hideous and infamous than the revolu
tionary government."
RfMARKS.
Such are the monsters and such the order of
of tiling* which our American diforganizers
still continue to idolize, notwithstanding the
flood of truth that is daily pouring from the
peiw of elegant French writers on the Crimes
of the Jacobins. They are unwilling that the
truth ihould appear, and stigmatize as Royalists
all the humane men who feel an abhsrrence at
the enormities committed during the revolution.
Not a writer in France on thecondu& of their
Jacobins but fays, he wants words to
the feelings of hoirorand indignation which a
recoiled icnjof their butcheries excites. Of
twenty papers printed daily in Paris, only two
or three take part with the Directory and the
Jacobinic members of the Councils, all the reft,
to the number of seventeen or eighteen are on
the fide of the great body of the people who
deleft anarchy and its abettors, and wifli for
nothing so mÂ»ch as peace, order and good gov
ernmentâ  As a proof of the final] number of
prints wh'ch favor Jacobinism, we shall
adduce the authority of the patriotic Bathe,
Freneau and Co.*whofe papers fay "that of all
the prints we have quoted, his (Louvet's) is
the only one decidedly on the Republican, or
what is termed the Jac(4Â»in fide of thequeftion."
Yetftrange otclf! ihefe conjiftmt gentlemen ,
after the candid acknowledgment above quoted, .
fay, that the faflion in this country are ransack
ing the French Royalist publications, wfcich fay
they, are few in number, to bluft the charafter '
of (he whole Kevolotian, and fligmatiie ihe '
French as naturally cruel or malicious.âOf a I
number of pamphlets written in France on the /
Revolution now in my poffeffian, there is not ,
one but exprefles in language of manly indigna- ,
tion the horrid crimes of the Revolutionary Co- â 
â¢vernment. Tl*t the Ar.tifederal Jacobins a- 1

mortalities committed in France during thei-Re- '

how did the citizensof America in general fym

Gentlemen,
WHEN a single error in private life is
brought forward by the malignant spirit of
faftion, to tarnilh the charafter and disturb
the peace of the most virtuous patriots A
merica has to boast of, every sensible, deli
cate and liberal mfod is wounded, and im
mediately becomes interested to relcue merit
from the fangs of its merciless, unfeeling
opprefTors. The mingled emotions of pity
and indignation fertcd my mind <jn reading
the defence of Col. Hamilton ; pity at the
weakness of human nature, which in this
refpeft is so conspicuous in that otherwise
great personage for writing the defence ;
indignation at the pitifulâmalevolence of
Mr. Monroe who drove him to it, by cru
clljj refilling him a certificate to do away an
atrocious calumny preferred against him by
the infamous author of " the history of
the United States for the year 1796," con
tained in No. 5 and 6, whose envenomed
pen is dipped in the gall of a party, un
friendly to the firft and best charaÂ£erÂ» a
mony us, to our excellent constitution and
its Supporters, and even to our national
honor and interest, when opposed 10 the
present unprincipled rulers of a foreign na
tion who caress with one hand and (lab
with the other. Every generous and can
did mind must feel hurt at the cruel attempts
of Col. Hamilton's political enemies, to
wound his charafter and peace of mind by
daily alledging against him, at a palpable
proof of general moral depravity, a single
circumstance of an amorous nature, wtieh
I do not pretend to jtiftify, but which his
candid though I think imprudent and unne
ceflary confefiion fufficiently attones for.
That mind must have a small portion of
the divine spirit, and be totally destitute of
the god-like attribute of mercy, who, know
ing the frailty attached to humanity, espe
cially in what relates to the operations of the
JleJh, cruelly and unmercifully Condemns to
perdition and infamy a fellow creature, who
has ten thousand substantial virtues to set
against one single transgression, and who,
moreover, has atoned for it by a candid
confeflion of his guilt. When we take a
view of Col. Hamilton's public and private
charter, on a general, liberal, and unpre
judiced scale, what a source of admiration
does it not raise ? what a claim to public
esteem and gratitude does it not demand ?
Unlike his political enemies he is and ever
has been aftively laborious, (to the injury
of his health and private interest) in the
prosecution of meaftires for the honor and
advantage of his countryâhow many fa
tiguing days and restless nights has he spent
in devising plans and.promoting schemes for
the public benefit ? When very young he
took an early, decided, and uniform part
in the glorious revolution which secured our
independence ; in th<* attainment of that
objeft he was always unfriendly to any fa
crificeÃ not immediately cffential to securing
the great objedt in viewâwell knowing,
that to make Independence and Liberty belov
ed by enemies as well as friends, it ivas ne
cejfary to mahe them amiulle, and to divejl
them of all malevolent, sanguinary and revenge- <
ful attributes. When peace was the reward
of a seven years struggle for independence,
what an efFeft had his writings and condu&
in allaying the angry paflions of the zealous
partizans of the revolution,'by recommend- i
tng to them a generous oblivion and forgive- 1

his unremitted exertions to draw our coun

a (lifting in the eftablifhhient of our preftnt
admirable con'ftitution ? How many labori
ous days must he have spent in arranging
the chaotic mass of public debts, and giving
our finance and money operations that sys
tematic and beautiful appearance they at
present poflefs I What a multiplicity of
disorganized objefts came, within the duties
of that important office which he so honora

dudt in that dignified and truft-,worthy fta- ,

felf-intereft, his nofcje and difintereftcd foul
was too elevated to avaifitfelf of even those
advantages*" of fpeeulation, which he in
common with others might have enriched
himfelf from, and which hij previous know

\v hat embarrafTments was he not frequently
put to for want of money, although Secre

from the condud of Citizen Monroe's dear
and particular friends Delacroix, Truguet,
and Co. !
To delineate the charafter of colonel Ha
milton in private life, to enumerate jhe'ma
ny and great instances of his integrity, hu
manity, and generofny, would, my candid
ellow-citizens, be telling you what you all
know, what you have heard daily for many
years, what numbers of you have experi
enced, and gratefully acknowledge. How
has candor, probity, and industry, uniformlv

Shall we, by joiningor even listening to the
tales of his inveterate alfaflin-like revilcrs,
who are to a man the enemies of order, and
the greater part of them the apostles of vice
and villainy, gratify their malevolent and
wicked designs of ruining the reputation and
peace of the Ariftides of America ? No,

the fences of Vvhofe virtue were,
already brdken down. ! The acute sensibility

uncandid malignant vice, forcing itfelf into
the judgment-ieat of virtue, pronounces its
decrees with partiality, fury and injustice,
condemning as a vice in one country, what
they approve as a virtue in anotherâHorrid
profanation of every thing sacred.
It is notorious that citizen Monroe and
his partisans entertain and cherish a flrong
attachment, and even adoration for many of
the present rulers of France, whose lewdnefs
is proverbial. I hen why, good citizen Mon

Would you, virtuous citizen Monroe, cher

No, my pure democratic citiaen, you would

you bring forward, as a crime, in America,
what you countenance and advocate in

THE COKSTITUTION.
e this day were in hopes to have announ
ced to the public the launch of the frigate
Constitution : but after two attempts to set
her afloat, foe remains in perfeft fafety, on
the ways where (he was conftrufted.
Â» ever mortifying the circumstance may be to
the friends of the Constitution ; and how
ever ardent their prayers ifiight have been
for her fafe delivery into her destined ele
ment ; there cannot be the lead imputable
blame attached to the conftru&or ; or to
any, or to either of the gentlemen who
were condudtors of the operation. Every
thing that men could do, was done. Wis
dom and fcienet could not prevail, where in
evitable obftru&ionjoppofed afuperior force.
The of the Frigate
CONSTITUTION.
' If thrie tilings be r.ectjp('u), let's use them likf ne
ceflitiev' Sialjp eare,
k Disappointments arc not always to be
ranked among evils, especially when we
find that a disappointment is in the end more
beneficial than our firft wi(hes. This fenti- !
( menf is verified in the (late of the frigate, '
who'ftill remains firm in her cradle. The '
explanation of the matter will doubtless be
gratifyiag to an anxious public, who seem
to this vessel with a solicitude
1 > higbjy pleasing to the,great family of repub
lican America. The faft is this ; her con
flru&or found that the (hi? United States, |
which was launched at Philadelphia, had
too great an obliquity or dcfcent; in confe- {
quenCe (he run off her ways full an hour be
fore her con ftriiApr' intended ; which dam
aged'hfr keel and maimed several people.â
To prevent these evils, the Boftqn conftjuct
or laid the Constitution too level, and his
levelling system, or system of equality, has
produced all the inconvenience, and obstruCt
ed the punctual performance of the bufihefs.
Another reason is this, part of the ground
(he flood on, was the natural terrafirma, and
a part artificial or made ground. This
A made ground has funk by the immense
I weight of the ship ; and this finking occa
fiofted her obftm&ion yesterday. The eon
ftruftor could have forced her off, had his
pride or ambition exceeded hiu discretion . â 
k and patriotism ; but he chose to facrific'e his ;
feelings, rather than rifle the lives of. his fel
Â» low citizens, or the property of the public ; 1
and many thanks are due to him and Capt.
Nicholfon, for their decision. 1
To indifferent unthinking people, the dif- 1
appointment is mortifying. The Jaco- Â«
bins will crow, and the Chronicle, that 1
fpeakijig trumpet of the devil, will echo 1
the tale of disappointment, to ths utmost <
verge of its peftiferous influence. ]
To the gentlemen who are conversant 1
with ships, the occurrence is a consolation ; j <
they can apply the Dutch ptoverb, which c
faysâ"Stay a little while that we may get 1
done thefooner." The ancient Romans con- t
centrated much wisdom in their proverb I
of " fefiine tente"âmale hajle slowly. \
But what (hall we fay to tUe ladies, who r
are disappointed of the fine fight ? First, I
you mull submit to the powers above you, v
who guide and diredt all fsch weighty mat- li
ters. A remarkable interpolation has regu- v
lated every event of importance, which has p
yet affe&ed this country, and that it will I
still be the cafe is presumable in these ships, f
which are the little whet Is of an immense ti
machine. v
The Cortftellation, which is an assemblage tl
of the fixed stars, went off in spite of all a
earthly impediments, because the heavenly
bodies are placed where the art of men can- A
not reach, and where human prescience can- vi
, not controul. The United States ran ra- lc
pidly on, but withfomedamage and deftruft- c;
ion from.adverfe parties and opposing mate- b
rials ; but the Constitution formed with de- 1
liberation; coolness and extraordinary fore- (li
thought, cannot ea/ily be moved. But like in
the ark of the covenent, an emblem of some- fr
thing fapred, (he hesitates, and seems to fay, in
" conftrudted as lam with (kill, and confum- a
Â» mate judgment, my movements must be the ct
result" of cool, calm and deliberate judgment; tl
learn from my inanimate materials this lef
fÂ«>n of political wisdom ; that no step is so ei
likely to be lading as that which is pursued
with deliberation ; and remember, O Ame- ra
ricans ! that in the course of your history, so
your moll violent efforts, produced but lit- pi
tie, and that your greatest glory arose out bi
of your darkest gloom and apparent disap
pointments."

rt- In the Times of Saturday, Augufl 19,
lis 1 was the following paragraph :
as " The following was handed us for publica
jt- tion by a gentleman lately from Gsada
"s. loupe. â¢ ;
id That one John Perry, lately from New
id London, and a certain Park Avery are
is equally concerned in fitting oyt priv.iteers

1- j that the plunder they have obtained is (hip

in jof New York. Isaac Williams who is also
is as American, is captain of one of their pri
-- vateers, and had captured several Ameri
; cans."
t. On Saturday last the person of Perrv was
recognised on the wharf by several who had
f- seen him in Guadaloupe, and were well ac- ! (
)- quainted with his conduA in that place.â
it Upon information being circulated through
0 the town, a great number of the inhabitants
[I collected, and so exasperated were the, peo
ple against the conduft of an American, who
t j had joined a piratical set of robbery in plun
; dcring our citizens, that he very narrowly
h escaped receiving a coat of tar and feathers.
By the interference however, of several gen
i- tlemen, he was taken before the mayor, to
b be dealt with, agreeably to law, by the ci
vil authority. By his declaration at the ti
3 mayor's office it appeared, that he failed from f,
, New London the begining of January last, f (
, with a cargo of flock, and arrived at Guada- ti
- loupe the latter end of the fame month, 1 t<
- were he flayed 6or 7 months, and was em- f<
s ployed in the disposal of his cargo &c.â k

whence he ttxik (hipping for Alexandria in j

1 arrived here on Friday last.
By the dispositions of captain Willis and
â¢ Mr. Peter Murray, it was evident that his
â  vessel immediately upon her arrivalin Guada- .1 '"i
. loupe, was converted into a privateer and
â  called the Vi&oriotis, and was commanded
â  by au, American- by the name of Williams: an
That it was well known in G'uadalcupe, that tU

in her hold for that purpose': and, that,
from the general condlxft of Perry in interdl

BALTIMORE, September 2? ;
By Capt. Sanger, from Port-0 Psix, 1
we have been favored with a proe' ation c;ll]
from Touffaint, general in chief of the ar- i
mies of St. Domingo, to the citizens of the
Cape, soldiers of the garrisons, and cufti- 1 +
vators of the plain. The gentleman, into jT.
whose hands we put it for translation, fays, Bu
it contains nothing more than a call on the refj
inhabitants to behave themselves peaceably ma
and quietly under the laws of the virtuous thc
Raimond, and toliften not to the perfidious
emissaries of Santhonax, who haÃ been sent s
before the tribunal of his country.
Great hopes began to be entertained
that our city was about to be restored to its 1
usual health, and fomÂ« who had taken the a- vvi
larm, began to thin danger over. Their the
fond hopes would probably have been real- P lic
ized, had we not been visited by a drivel- 1
ling rain on Friday, which instead of unload- t "'t
ing our atmosphere, clogged it with noxious l>y ,
effluvia, and took its direftion weftwardly S
over the town. From the town few people thc
have aÂ»yet moved on recount of a "contagi- tu '"
ous fever ; but this week will iriform them
whether it will be prudent to flay, or to S
seek fafety by flight from their homes

From the NEW YORK DIARY.
Mr. Editor,
Some time since, a paragraph in the Di
ary announced, that a gentleman had, the
evening before, seen a comet in nearly the
wcftern direftion. In coofequence of this 1
information, the philosophers of our city '
were put on the watch to fee such a rare '
phenomenon. Investigations took place,' '
and the starry element was invaded with all
the telescopes that were to be had ; when, .
behold ! our comet proved to be the beau- '
tiful evening planetâVenus. The watch
still continuing, it was at length announced,
that the fcomet bad really appeared in the
south east quarter ;'an investigation, as be
fore, took place ; and, as before,
proved to be the brilliant planet*âJupiter ;
but the inveftigatots were much more gra- I
tified in viewing this planet, because they
saw witoitt its vicinity, the satellites, or a
Jupiter's moons; and, rtta the furfaee of 1
the noble planet, Jupiter's belts. It is said !j*
alio, that the comet has been seen at Cam- J?
bridge, Baltimore, and Newhaveli; but I ap- .
prehend that it is the fame that has appeared
in our city, for it is strange that none of the
fpe&ators have announcedthrft theyhavefeen â¢
the tail. I assure you, lir, that I keep a good R
look ont for the Comet, with good teles- ,
copesâand whenever any appears, I (ball 1
with the greatest pleasure, announce it to
my fellow citizens, and invite them to come
at- the top of tHe Museum, and view it thro' .
my excellent telescope. G. BAKER.

Stone, his deputy, preiided : his Grace en- w ;

CHARLESTON, September 12.
Extraft of a letter from a gentlemart in Phi
ladelphia, to his friend in this eity, dated
August 28, 1797.
, " The alarm (on account of the fever)
haÂ« been so great, that every body that can
move are gone or going. The proclamation
haÂ» frightened the people more than the fe
ver ; the fear of the husband being,parted
frr m the wife ; the wife from the husband ;
apd children from their parents, has had a
terrible effeft on the minds of the people ;
and some extraordinary cruel scenes liavs
been already afted ; and the terror of the
fight Â«f the yellow flag, I hare heard, has
been the cause of some deaths.
" You know my fentimeots of Rush's
fyfttm, and I fee no reason to alter that o
pinion : it rather strikes me more forcibly,
that it is a deftnudive mode of proceeding ;
that it may be compared to a lamp, where
all the oil is drawn off, it bums feebly, and
just before dying, it blazes up. Such has
been the cafe in several instances, now and
in 1793, when we heard the patient was get
ting- well, and sometimes out of danger, the
next report was that they were dead !
" I have not heard how the fever was yes
terday or this morning, but the increase of
deaths and new cases on Saturday was eon
fiderable. The streets are becoming lone
some by the prodigious numbers removing,
and however ridiculous the cause of flight,
yet with the distress which will be brought
on many, it will be the meaÃj, perhaps, <of
sooner flopping the infeftion.
Thursday afternoon, the father fearful of
fending for a physician, Jeaft his boy should
be taken and fenb to the hospital, prffcri
bed himfelf, firft, some lemonade, a cooler,
and a warm bath that evening, the next
morning a little cooler, in the evening re
peated : Saturday, he got well and a(ked
for vi&uals ; some sorrel broth was taken
(a fort of sorrel fold in our market, boiled
in water, with a little butter, and foma
bread crumbled in it.) Mr. C. tells me that
ke believes if he had sent for one of the A
merican doftors, his son would have died. '
The outset was a high fever, pain in his
back, head ach and delirium.
" Our situation is fine, and I give the Co
lumbo bkters to all the family. We bathe -
in cold water every day, I mean the children- â 
and myfei' ; when any of us are goingont
we eat garJic, and shall depend upon the rr n
chins to >apen and cleanse the bowels, if z
ny complaints arise ; and we have no fear
with these means to keep it off, and even to
effefta ciite, without the aid of phyfieians."

; CAUTION. to ,
r TTTHF.BF.AS a combination of men in this nc ,
1 W county have undertaken to enrich thÂ«m- the
f selves.by fabricating titles to sundry valuable trails he
I of land, the property of gentlemen living in New coi
Yotk, Philadelphia, London and ParÂ», for which wh
.. trails of Isnd large sums of money have been paid lor
s to thoft* fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers â 
s It is therefore jtlft that public information should
s be given, to the end, that the injured may feck re
if dress while the men have property, and are to be
a found. Those who have been discovered are Tru
fe man H.frrUon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re- (^
i- fide in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly ind di
several others who go under fictitious names. It is jj,
r- iluppofcd that the lands offered fcr sale on those fa- di
3 f bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand e< j
1- dollars. Such as we have aflual knowledge of are th
of as follows; Ltvts No. II and 11, Otfego patent, fu
thenfand acres each, the a&ua! property of William
Dellwyn. now of I.opdon ; lots No. 58 and 64, er
_ fame pitent, tkoufand acres each, the property of iv
Mr. Clfaumont, now of Pari<, and James Averill
and others, ol this State. There is some grounds Â«<
d to suppose that the lands of Richard Welis and
' Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are ui.der their
, t management.âThe Printers will do well to give
' this a,place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing those lands, as alio to de
l'' prive those men in future from impofiijg on indivi
,C duafs, which their education and address have en- j,
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been {- t
_ a shopkeeper of some note in this country. _ si
The following affidavits will fct in a clear point r
Â©f view the wickfidnefs of those men, which when tl
the public have perifed, will induee them to ex- h
cufe the interference of â  Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, Jnly 18th, 1797- v
I Thomas Kelly,of the County of Otfego, hav- ti
ing been led into an error, by John Witcamb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to lign a
deed to them, for lot No, 58, Otfego patent, which
â. was the property of William f. Franklin now,Mr,
Chamont's and others ; and further the said Joseph |
. and Truman did persuade me to do this against my j
Â°* inclination, which was made out on the 10th day (
of November, 1793, or set back two years so as ;
to bring it to th*t time ; and further the nam? ol
