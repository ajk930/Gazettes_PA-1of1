a single woman, formed the resolution to m<

cause of so much cruelty. fit
The mother was committed to prison on fu
Monday morning, to meditate on the awful tli
doom that awaits htr. ef
We wi(h that we could stop here, with- at
out, detailing any further inhuman depreda- to
tions of mankind! especially at the com- n<
menccment of a new year ; âbut fate has vv
â¢ decree otherwise: tl
OrrSatttrAay last, were liro't ol
to town and fafely-imprifoned, John Hauer, pi
Charles M'Manus and Francis Cox, for
the wilful murder of Mr. Ffancis Shitz. The fa
particulars, as near as we have been able to e]
collefl, are as follows : d
Francis Shitz, with his brother Peter. c<
Shitz, had been at a neighbouring vendue on ti
Thursday lad, and returned in the evening ai
as supposed something fatigued, as the for
mer had laid himfelf on a bench, near a p
Hove, to reft, while the latter retired to bed o
in an adjoining apartment. They had not tr
.been long in this tranquillity, before a female
o( the house, discovered a light in the kitch- c
*n, and opening the door, wai frightened n
Z\. the appearance of several men, and im- o
mediately endeavored to awaken Mr. Fran- o
cis Shitz ; but she had only in part efiefted c
her purpose, when one of the affafiins pre-
N fented a pistol to his head, which he difchar- tl
and killed him on the spot. In the t!
mean time, two others proceeded to the fl
bed-room of the brother, Mr, P- Shitz, o
with axes, and at the firfl fi,roke whiijh one ti
of them made, his axe caught the cord of n
â ky the Curtain, which in some meafore stopped r \
the fordc of the bluw: he was, however, t
very much cut on the (houdder, which li
c'(Hifed him to leap from his bed to the floor, t
and to have the presence to fei/e a chair, m
with which he knocked them both down ; t
but in leaving the room, he received ano
ther deep wound 011 his posterior, which o
did not prevent him, however, from locking o
the door, and escaping out of a - window, v
and retreating to the barn, where he placed c
himfelf in u narrow pafTage, armed* with i:
a pitchfork ; but after waiting a cÂ«niijera- g
'ble time, and finding the mureerers, !.ad N'
gone, he repaired immediately to Shausr s- laiu
town, a distance of two miles, r art with trAml- of.;
intr his weakeefs with hiss of' Hood, where , com
he (pread the alarm, ar.d by the vigilance o. 1

treptd young man. who thus defended him- fide;
fvtf. k only 17 years 6f age ; and although frOr
at preTerit, very much indisposed ( there are tion
great hopes of his fecovtry.
The motive which led to the above lior- cert
rid deed, is thought to have originated with ing

upon him for the accbunt of the execution n
of the Mint Law. He states that receipts p
eft and payments on account of Government h
ale were made at the bank of the United States; h
his that monies received at a distance were paid t
or, in bills; that the bank Direftors had a com- t
to mon interest in all the specie deposited, but h
lad that they were always willing to Â«o-operate t
>er in the wiihes of the government, and would f
ras have at any time advanced a reafonah'e '
er! quantity of Foreign coin for the Mint; but t
er, in the years 1795 and 1796, the quantity t
)ne of Foreign coin, other than Spanish, was a
ilt, very inconsiderable, and if it had been a- I
ta- therwife, the situation of the Treasury at j 1
the that time would not admit of fuffering con- I
fiderable sums to lie at the Mint; hut that j
011 since the Proclamation of the President of t
â ful the United States was issued, the quantity <
ef Freneh crowns had very much increased <
th- at the Banks, and tliat in future, according 1
da- to the present regulations, there would be

j ces the house had been told that the ftiMT.p- j (

complete and put the vtffels to sea. 1 his
proceeding, he thought furniflitd Â£
â  the cleaved evidence that that management JsJ,
had been wrong, and might as well t,he 1
1 throw the money of the public into the Let
. sea at once, as appropriate it to an obieft to ; a m>
which there feenied to.be no cud. Nut f"-

r ' Mr. Gallatin said, when he was up be- thou
, ! fore, he had declared that no statement had con d
- come before the committee of ways and T
> means from the treafary department ; in a fc, o v
which affrrtiejn he was correft. The only lowi
papers laid before that committee were live 0
1 papers furnifhed, he supposed, by thd naval 0 f t
. conllruflor. That committee had no efti- (incÂ«
. mate before them from which they could Ore
. draw any conclusion. He agreed with the JDol
gentleman from S. Carolina, that one faft Hui
s appeared, viz. that more money would be
y wanted. This was gathered from the let
t ter of the secretary of (he treasury ; but *
- beyond that they had nothing upon which
d to aft. The question was, therefore, wheth- w
r, er the committee ought now to make an ap- A
it propriatioii, or wait until the proper efti- **â 
mate w'as received. If the papers alludeti
0 to, were examined, it would be found there
d I was no date to any of them, except to one oj
It i which v/ss dated Bolton, Nov. 30. It could of t
is not 'oe ascertained, therefore, whether or not a g'
the 151,000 dollars were Wanting beyond
g the money lafl appropriated. Indeed it was yiÂ°J
lS altogether impossible to form any correft i- 111 '
?n dea, from these papers, of the sum wanted, verl
j. or whether it was immediately neceflary to dex
tjiake an appropriation. Thefnpapers might or t
:d be correft, but tl*ey were not official. But flev
:e there was another paper, which might be aft
id relied upon, stating that on the firft of Jan- cor
of uary there was a balance remaining.of the tha
in last appropriation of 20,501 dollars, and
a- that no money had been expended since.
a This paper was not laid before the commit- ln "
x. tee of ways and means ; if it had been, he P et
v- doubted not the fame conclusion would have l y
been drawn, viz. that 110 inconvenience an<
nt could be sustained by postponing the appri
fi- priation for a week or two until the proper ,
u- estimates ftiould be laid before the house. .cir
rd Mr. G. concluded by faying, that he a- thii
ds greed with the gentleman from Virginia, G "
in that there appeared on the face of the laws
on this fubjeft, a suspicion that there had pr ,
to been some mismanagement in the expendi- No
ch ture of the money which 'had been appro- ing
priated. From what cause this had arisen
ys whether from our inexperience in thebu- as
m- finefs, or from a culpable misapplication of
nt. the mcyiey, he could not fay, but it was
ng proper to stop and look into what had been
a- done, before they went on to appropriate SI
ich more money.
all Mr. Harper replied, that whether the
10l- money which had been appropriated to this Si
to objtft had been properly or improperly ex
fti- pended, was not now the question. The p
>re- expence of these veftels had always been an
the argument with certain gentlemen against
ury completing them. With refpeft to what â¢"
ary had fallen from the gentleman from Penn
iftd fylvanja (Mr. Gallatin) he had admitted all
iich that was necessary to shew the propriety of
' ef- the present appropriation, since he admitted
be- that there was fufficient evidence before the
the committee to fliew tljat more money
for was wanted to finifh the frigates. He tho't
low it was, therefore, quibbling to objeft to it,
ded because certain estimates were not before
was them. When the Secretary of the Trea- 1
ght r y told the house more money would be
rto wanted, was it fupppfed he overlooked the
'ays balance In Hand â  But how, it might be afk
lich e d, when this balance reimined in hand pn
!tat- the ift January, could the appropriation
of in wanted ! Because V
hey he answered, bills might haye been incurred
eft. which it was necessary to pay. The whole
:fti- queflion, he said, resolved itfelf into this,
:ary whether the completion of the vefTels (hould
pon be suspended until an enquiry fnould be
made into the expenditure of the money al- Ci
ma- ready appropriated ? He did not wonder to
be- hear that this was the wish of gentlemen ,j
It who had always thought it their duty to B
:eiv- oppose jhe building of the frigates ; but -
he (hould think it extraordinary indeed, if
man that part of the house who wiflred the vef- q
>hen fek to be finifh ed, (hould concur in that o
dto pinion. Mr. H. was ready to acknowledge
the that these vessels had cost by far too much
md, money. He did npt know from what cause
icfed this had happened ; Ije believed it had been
To partly from the novelty of the undertaking ,
auld from the materials having been felefted v
; the from the most durable and costly ; from the i;
the detached fituatiou of the vessels and from J
the a variety of other causes. But from what
ead. ever causes the extraordinary expcnce had
ant- arisen, gentlemen were prepared to meet t
the enquiry ; but in the mean time he trust- f
'/art. E d the business would befuffered to proceed. 1
Out of 150,000 dollars which were eftiina-
5 ted as necessary to complete the vessels, 011 -
9 lv 20,000 were asked, which, he trusted, [
7 there would be no farther objeftion to ap- :
propriate.

1 hey are aware that gentlemen are unconfoious,
of any wrong done to tie intereli of the inititu- I
h tioijby this practice, from a general, though mif
i taken idea that Checks are die repr; I'eqtatives of a f
â¢t right to many feats in the Theatre, during an

y when in fa<3, they were never intended as more
I than toltns by which the Door-keepers are enabled

they tbentfelvtl have Ix'en before in the Iheatre, or 0

I Independent of the injury the Managers fuflain,
I such a practice encourages a croud Of' idle boy's and
odicr difordcrly psrfons to f'ul-round the doors of r
3 the Thca're, to the 001 ruption pf.their morals arid ''
e the great annoyance of the Audience. '
It has also been thefource of two evils of no in- 1
