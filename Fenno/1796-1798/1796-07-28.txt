We hear from many placis of the gencrnus ex I
ertions to relieve the city of Charlellon. We lean
itom good authority, that the lodes do not exceed
the films mentioned to the public, but that they
ial! very heavy upon the middle class of citizens,
a"?d f> are more prcper obje&s to an enlightened '
Ciin'y. The fraternity of Masons dispensed with
their usual feaftÂ« in the city, and gave a generous
aiiillance to the fufferexs. The words for the mil
fio of thÂ« Prefbyteriao church in the city upon the
Occasion of a charitable contribution were happily
adapted. At a-time of public distress, every man
is ready to propose something to prevent the like
Calamities. It his propofrd to furnifh the ci
ty with drains which may be filled and emptied at
p'e?.fure. Weils also at the public expence in par
ticular situations have been rr entioned. The po-
of the city alio becomes a matter of ferioos
cire, and fueh things are noticed as lead to ftich
melancholy evils. The licences for public ho-ufes,
and to retail -fpiriruout liquors are to be publilhed,
wuh the names of the perforis who recommended
fueh as hold the licences. The Vagrant Ad\ of
that irate is also recommended to the public notice.
It has been proposed to give frem the steeples no
tice of the place of any fires which break out ;to
form fire companies; to institute badges ot fueh ]
companies; and to oblige fsmilies to provide water.
Resolutions have already been taken about widen- |
ing the flrects. Charitable conitibulions are fcri
oufly demanded from the wealthy and the good,-of
all our towns, remembering we are liable to the
fcrae dethu&ioH. The reccmmer.dation.t to attend
to health are in all thefonthern papers. Mitchel'j
facts during the prevalent sickness of New-York
allure us of the advantages of water. While it
wts unhealthy near it was fafe at ancho Â£
rage at a little distance. No evaporation from ponds (
was attended with ill confequence6 till the mud was
bare. Rain showers did always relieve, and wet c
cloathfs in the wind. Fogs and damp weather
were evllÂ«. He recommends tc. attend to the qua t
lities of water used for drinking, and to provide
Cold fair water to walh cloaths, placing a due ft reft a
upon walhing of the body, cleanlincfg and frelh â
cioathifg.
Dr. Priestley having compared " the principles j a
of the Heathen Phi!ofÂ»phy, with the principles of n
CJjiifiianity, in bis late difcomfe observes, ,
" On the whole, we may finely fay tiat, had
modern unbelievers found in the scriptures any of n
the doctrines, which 1 have (hewn to have been pro- t
feffed by .the pliilolop'hers of antiquity, had they t
found there the dotlrin- of two co eternal princi
ples, that of the emanation of all fouls from the ~
substance of the fupretne being ; the absorption of j;
them into it again ; with their repeated emissions 0
aod reflations to all eternity; had they found v
there the doftiina of the formation of all things Q
by the fortuitous concontfe of atom?, that the air v ,
is filled w;th demons of diff-r nt characters, Sireft- j,
ing the ass irs of the woild at their plaafure, and u
giving intimations of future events by omens, and
divination; had they founfl in the scripture the
do&rinc of tbe pre-exiltence of all human fouls,
their lapse into gross bodies, where tliey are con
fined, nnd also contaminated by their connexion [,
with so uebafing a companion, the purification of
their embodied fouls by su'lerity and mortification,
their transmigration through thÂ« bodies of animals,
by way of prepaiation for their ascent to the im- t(
perial regions ; had they there fotisd the doflrine
of one common principle of intelligence, or foul of
the univeife, in all men and animals, without giv
ing to each a permanent exillencr, had all or any
of these dodlrines been found in ihe scriptures,
would tliey net have exclaimed against fus.li crude
notices and wild conceptions, and have rejedled
the system without farther examination? It was,
in faÂ£l, the finding no such opinions as these ifl
the scriptures, that firft led Christian philosophers
(after having adopted several of them from a hea y
then fuurce, and having long endeavored to hold a ]
them in conjunflion with their Christian principles)
that led them to fufpeft their truth, and further j
reflexions on the fubjeiS led many to explode them
altogether. Thus is the world indebted to Chri
â¢flianity fqr the deletion of errors, which were the
disgrace of hnman reason, though patronized by
the ovott eminent phihifophers of the heathen world
âyet modern though lying, with the | f
reft of the world, undet so great obligations to
Chiillianitv, are now busily affcirlting.it with every '
weapon of reason or ridicule. Its friends, howe-
'ver, are under no apprehensions about it. This
very ftateof things was forefeen and foretold, by (t
its founder. Revealed religion is so far from ftr ink
ing from, that it invites, the llrittefl examination.
Its friends being thofc of reason and truth) engage
in its vindication only as flip ported by reason and ji
truth, ar.d as favorable to the bell intercflj of man- ,
kind."

Although we regret the difference of opinion ?

(hat he has departed to Vienna fer that purpose.

FRONTIERS OF TURKEY, April 30. Au
The Porte at last convinced that Russia pursues Â°' te
' with obstinacy the projeÂ£t of invalion and war, L
which it combines with tire courts of Vienna and
London, prepares itfelf 011 all (ides (o oppose against
those violences an adtive resistance; besides the ar- mOl
my which meets at Andrianople, which is become
in a manner a place of arms, whence all the troops P' 0 '
destined for the defence of our places in Europe " r!
will be drawn, numerous garrisons meet at Bender eon
Choczina, and in all Moldavia. It is added, that wat
the germ of the confederate army of the Poles, -
who endeavours to re-conquer iheii liberty, increaf- "P 1
es daily, and the Divan entertain. already, some P l! '
hopes of treaties of defenfive alliances with fume
European powers concerned in preventing the-dif- awi
memberiog of the Oroian Empire.â It is also
repyrfed.that the Grand Seijnicr ha* concluded a n
treaty with one of the parties who divide. Persia, '" e
and that party has engaged itfelf to make a flroog " e
diversion in Georgia, in cafe of a rupture with vcr
Russia. T1 at rupture is so much the more certain " '
that the Ruffian general Subor, is about marching
with Â»f 2-4,000 men, to attack that part
of Persia which efpotifed the cause of the Porte.
The number of Turkifti troops who have already l ' u
met at Andrianople, is computed already at 2co,eco
men, and it isafTerted that army is abundantly sup
plied.with every thing that is neceflary to open the Â®i
campaign at the fit ft order. One mnft know
frugality of the Ottoman armies, not to be ado
niflied at the facility with which the Divan looked m
for all the fiipply of provillons and victuals which
