CONGRESS.
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES,
Tuesday, May 23.
In a committee of the whole, Mr. Dent in the
chair,-on the answer reported to the Prcfi
dent's Speech, Mr. Nicholas's proportion
being under confideratien :
Mr. Oiles said, that as the committee ap
peared divided on the address, and as he had
; attended the discussion, he submitted to the con
| fideration of members whether it would not be
1 advifeable, in ordtr to produce a spirit of una
i nimity and cool deliberation, to recommit the
report and fend the amendment also to the com
mittee with an addition of members : he wilh
ed the gentleman last up had been more delicate
on a fubjedl that {he had touched ; if he infers
that because one part ef the members may think
a ra(h measure just, that those who think differ
ently must not exercifc their judgments in think
ing the contrary, he thought the gentleman had
overstretched his reasoning jhe was one of those
who felt a strong apprehension of a war ; he
thought one means would be more likely to
prevent it than another â&he wasforuiing that
preventive measure because he thought it both
just, honourable, and wife ; wo all concur in
our declaration of at least a Jove of peace, he
was sorry ts hear language which betrayed a
very different disposition j he was for (hewing
our ultimatum and taking the consequences, but
he would not agree to be either filly or insolent
in the proceeding, because nothing was so unbe
coming a wife man or a wife people, as an
ger or petnlent irritation, when their happintft
and that of millions was at (lake; he \vi(hed
the report to be re-committed, that we might
proceed thus wifely ; after we had determined
well and the issue Ihould disappoint our fair and
just expeflations âhe (hould not beone ofthofe
that would a(k othert to support his opinionsâ
he would standby his country in the storm, and
lhare its fate, prove then by 1 recommittal that
you do net aim at the triumph of a party, he
therefore moved the recommittal ; which was
opposed by Mr. Harper and Mr. Brooke on the
ground of its not being calculated to produce a
ny effect.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker J said that he ho
ped the motion of the gentleman from Virginia,
which had for its obje<Â£l a recommitment of the
answer, would not prevail It was certainly
very desirable that the Seleift Committee, ap
pointed in the firft instance for the purpose,
Ihould have reported such a draft of an answer
as would have united in its favour all parts of
tht house. He was not the only one who had
expefterlit. Disappointed, however in fact)
an expectation, they were forbidden, Mr, Day
ton said, to indulge a hope than any good couM
Ibe derived from fending it back to * committee
j before one vote at least was taken, and thefenfe
j of the house thus far ascertained as to the flyle
and tenor of their reply. If this propofilion
for amendment (hould succeed, then the bufioefs
would be right for rcferenceto a committee, who
would take such amendment as their guide, and
fo'modify the report as to render the whole ccir
refpondent with it. As to the motion more
immediately under consideration, he could not
' give it his unqualified vote, more efpeeially
whtn it was considered and acknowledged to
be in its operation a complete fubftitutc. Can
dor, however, compelled him to declare, that
it contained one featart, and that too an im
portant one, which attracted his attention, and
would certainly have his approbation. There
would, however, be a taiore proper place for
introducing it than that proposed by the mo
yC- Stripped as tfcs more ciccpticr.a'Jc tp.t
ter with which it wu,th;n eonr.efted, it might
very well he adopted as an amendment ill one of
the'lat'ter pirignphs of the report, and would
not at all vary the principle, or be imonfiilent
with the general tendrofit.
Wednefda'y, Afay 24.
Mr. Swanwick openedifie debate this morn
ing.' He'lamented the iofs of time Which was
generally experienced at the optY.ing of every
felfion in debating the anfwerto the Prcfidcnt's
i speech, when, perhaps business of the fiift mo
ment called for immediate attention It wjs
mueh to be wilhed that committees appointed 1
for this purpose, would confine to
the inftruflion! which were given to them on
the occaGon, which were in general terms, viz.
*'s to prepafe a refpeAful address, alluring the
President that the house will take into their se
rious consideration the various important nut
ters recommended to their attention.' If an
swers were drawn in general term? conform
ably to these inftruitions, he thought very ma
ny of the embarrassments which they now ex
perienced would be avoided, and every member
would be left at liberty to purluc fueh ineafures
as appeared to them right, when they came be
fore him in the ordinary courl'e of business, un
clogged by any creed which he rr ight have been
called toaffent to before he had an opportunity
of considering the fubjeifts it contained. It al
so often occasioned much warmth in debate, and
served to divide the house into two parties on
the very threshold of their business. This could
not poflibly have any good effrfl, but the con
trary ; he (hould therefore be happy to fee the
practice limplifiedor abphlhed together.
The effedt at present ha3,been, that no sooner
had the committee appointed to draft an address
trade a report, than the gentleman from Virgi
nia proposed a substitute, which atcording to
his idea, was more proper. A warm debate
had taken place, and he believedf that either
might be adopted without effetfl, as they were
merely a form of words leading to no conclu
sion. Suppose a majority of one was obtained
on the report, what end would be produced ?
None : for it might be that the very persons
who voted on thiÂ» general question, might vote
ag2inft particular fubjefls when they came un
der consideration ; as every one would recollefl
the difficulties which had been experienced in
getting three frigates built, and this difficulty
he doubted not, would again occur. Since,
however, thele'two forms of an anfwerwere be
fore them ; and they were called upon to fay
which they would adopt, It might be proper to
go into some confideratioc of the fubjedt.
The difference betwixt the two produiftions
seemed to be, that the one reported seemed to
express great indignity on account of the inju
ries received ftom the French republic, and a
determination to repsl them ; that produced by
the gentleman from Virginia was of a more
conciliatory tone, recommending to the Presi
dent to begin his negociation with placing the
French republic on the fame ground with the
other belligerent powers. So that the difference
was (imply as itrefpefted a few words.
What were the arguments in favor of the
warm tone ? They were told it would have a
great effeift on the French republic ; because if
a fpitited answer were given to the President's
, c&mmunicaaion, fignifying (zi his colleague,
Mr. Sitgreaves expieffed it) that we were de
termined to " die in the last ditch," it would
Itrike them with terror. If he thought thisef-'
fedt could be really produced, it might be some
inducement for him to agree toit.
Mr. S. remarked, that they were told by Mr.
Pinckney, in his letter to the Secretary of State,
that it was probable that two events had contri
buted to his dismissal from the French republic,
viz. tne, the victories of Buonaparte in Italy,
the oiVr, the address of the Senate and Honfe
of Keprcfentatives in anfwerto the speech of
the President at the last session. With refpeft
to the answers alluded to, no opinion could be
formed from this afferlion, because, though that
Â©f the House of Representatives was tolerably
moderate, yet that of the Senate was as warm
it anything could be produced. He read cx
traÂ«sis from both, and compared them with each
other, giving the credit, which in his opinion,
was due to the nod moderate.
The firft and most necessary step to be taken
was, to put all the belligerent powers upon the
fame footing, which could not be an offence to
any. But it was said that to recommend this
measure to the executive, was to dictate to him ;
that it was carrying humility on the front of
the minister who should be employed. What 1
said Mr. S. would it be to carry humility ill the
front, to fay," I some to place you on the fame
footing with the most favored nation ?" It cer
tainly could not ; since it was the language of
right reasonâos juflice.
As to chelating to the executive, could it be
called diflating, when we merely express our r
piaion and'advice to him on points, which he
has himfelf laid before us, and in order to deli
berate on which we were thus unusually called
together ; very low and debasing indeed, must
be the situation of this house, if they were to be
muzzled and prevented from laying their ftnti
ments before the chief magistrate of the union.
When treaties are made, we are told they are
laws over which we have no powerâlf we dare
not speak en the fubjeift before they are made,
is this house reduced, merely to the odious talk
of laying, taxes, without being allowed to ex
press its fenfc on any other important public
measures eoniuvtcd with them ? Why does the
Prefidi nt communicate these things to us, if we
are not allowed to express any sentiments about
them ? Why do the people eleil their reprsfen
ta'tives, all over this widely extended empireâ
if, when they are convened, they are not allow
ed the faculty ef expressing their opinions 011 the
dearest interests of their constituents .'âBut it
isftated that this will create divisions among the
brmches of government, who ought always to
all and think alike- Were this the cafe, theie
was no ofe to divide the government, as our
conllitution does, into three branchesâthey
1 might all have been left in one, ar.d then no ac
: cidents of this kind would have happened ; but
the fail is, this very division of the branches
was devised in order that they might operate as
, checks on each other. The people thought it
better that a division of this kind Ihould pre
vent aflirig at all, than fhat we Ihould aft hasti
ly and uHadviledly.âThus when a law, after
1 mature deliberation, passes this house as wife
â  and good, the senate were not obliged on this
1 account, to fee it in the fame light ; they judge
: for themfrlves, and if they fee cause reject it,
and no complaint takes plaee on oor part be
cause they do so. Ih ano her government, in
-1 deed that of England, all the branches have
> been contrived in the moll perfcA union, king*,
> lords, and mmmons all agree, but hath the go-
I vernmcnt been the beiter for this > Happy had
it been for that nation, had this not been the
cafe. Many an unwifc measure they have gone
into, might then, fortunately for the nation,
have been totally prevented..
But it ha'th been said we ought to express the
â  high eft indignation at the conduit of France.
Let us examine for a moment on what this is
founded. Three grounds have been mentioned
âtV dismission of our minister, the spoliation
on our (hips, and the interference with our go
vernment, in attempting to divide the peopla
from it. As to the firft, the dismission of our
â  minister, fai<l Mr. Si r.abedy can feel more fenfi
bly than I do the indignity ; hut it cn y K:.>
"*ne to regret, as I hive often already exprefi"d
my regrets, at our fending so many diplomat!::
gentlerrjet. to Europe. Wretched will be our
cafe, if we are embrÂ»i!ed whenever those gen
tlemen {ball be refufed, or uncivilly treated.
All history i> full of inftancesof wars, fouaded
on such points of etiquette is these, and they
admonish us only to avoid employing embaffie),
as much as polTible, to avoid these dangers from
our foreign <onntfl:Â»ns. But it seems, the di
reflory, by Mr. Pinckney's lettÂ«r, at the fame
time sent away 13 other foreign ministers j yet
fwe don't hear that these nations went to a
war on this account. One of them was Swe
den, a very powerful maritime nation, poffefled
of a considerable fleet, her minister was difmiff
ed âShe contented herfelf with fending away
the French minister also, and here-the dispute
ended. But surely allowance ought to be made
for the prcfent revolutionary state ot Franee.
If all things do not there with the or
der they ought ; it is perhaps because of their
present warlike and revolutionary poGtion,
which cannot but mend every day, and should
induce us to make some allowance for them

FRENCH INFLUENCEâNo. VI.
MR. RU3SI LL,
REASONING from the nature of man,
and of civil society, abftradied from experi*
ence, a pbilofopher might fairly deduce, the
dangerous nature, the pernicious effefts of
organized clubsâhe would naturally observe,
that such aflbciations had a tendency to ex
cite and foment afpirit of party, to localize
and narrow the feelings of thfc members of
them, to separate their ftjiings, their pride,
and their interest, from those of the commu
nity at largeâto establish that bane of all
governments, tt-at monster so univeifally
dreaded in antient as well as modern times,
the " Imperium in imperio"âthat such clubs
when opposed to a government, become the
more dangerous, as they were enabled to aft
with more fyllem, to preserve more consist
ency, to facilitate the commuwication of (lan
der and traiterous objedls, and to operate,
with mjre unity and Itronger effefl, than de
tached individuals poflibly could do. But
the melancholly tals, founded on the experi
ence of tl.c unhappy French, and corrobora
ted by some interclting events i u this country,
affords a darker pi&ure.
Anarchy, infurteftion, rapine and mu'der,
have marked the bloody foot Heps of disor
ganizing clubs in France, and if we Imve
happily eicaped these baneful effefts, these
horrid outrages, it iÂ» rather to be attributed
to the good sense of our people, the wisdom
and prudence of our rulers, thar. to any spirit
of moderation, any solid principles of vir
tue, in our " Conjlitutienal" societies. The
only (hiking feature, which was ever unveil
ed to the eye of an injured and indignant
public, was a mean, servile, childish imita
lion, of the maternal club, at Paris. They
copied, lilt the Chincfe, with too much mi
nuteness : They adopted not only the capti
vating principles of French " Liberty and
Equlity" but they introduced their style,
their bombastic and turgid expieflions : they
affe&ed also the Republican rudentfs (in
France termed fimplicity]âin their manners,
their conduft, and conversion. Like them,
too, they attempted to influence the public
opinion, with raree (hows, by civic fealis, by
republican symbols, by revolutionary mujic.
Tbey even dared at certain periods to applaud
the cut throat tunes intended to excite
French mabs to plunder, autrage and murder,
and to cenlure American mulic, commemo
rative of our national honor.
So widely diffufive was thei.r influence, so
subversive of national pride, and national Ito.
nor, that a cold apathy appeared re pervade
the great mass of the community. The ba
sest j:Vults upon our government, or nautral :
rights, from French infoleÃce, not only ef- .
. raped censure, but found dastardly advocates.|
If there were in the nation some who burned j
, with indignation at those abufrs, they were j
either intimidated by the thteats, or overaw- |
ed with the influence of what appeared to be '1
the public opinion. While on the other hand
through the inÃrumentality of the Jacobins,
the people were inflamed and outrageous at
every aggrefiion of the British. Every in
jur)', every outrage of that nation, (all of
which were unjuftifiable) were magnified and
distorted. War } horrid war, with that inso
lent foe, was the most moderate meafare we
could adapt. Honejlus, at one time the prop
and the oracle of the Jacobin Club at Bos.
ton, in a speech which will not soon be for
gotten, undertook to prove that we were at
that time, and had long been at open war
with Great Britain. ftatefman,
has now changed his tone, and viewing in
juries through thedenfe medium of gallic In
fluence, he cannot perceive any thing irrita
ting, any tiling unjuftifiable, any thing in
deed which is not commendable, io the conduft
â¢ of France, towards America. The pru
dence of our executive in preferring honora
ble negociation to>7umi!iating war, io the
safe of Great Britain, was called pulillani
mity, nay it was even hinted, that WASH
. NGTON was absorbed in the vortex of
Britannic influence.
In the cafe of French depredations, FrenchÂ«
barbarities, French insults, more cruel, more
; outrageous, more unwarrantable, more un
grateful to a country, which (lonelily and
anijincerely cheri/bed her eaufe, no measures
can be too lenient, no condefceniion too
mean. T hough her haughty tyrants, in all
the turgid infolenee of power, fhou'd kick

though with more bombastic pomp than

Mr. Russell,
THE writings Under the fignatureof ''!&â 
on'nfat," do honor to the head, and heart of
the writer : As a Stalefmai I he appears to
be thoroughly acquainted with the difpofi
rions and proceedings of our to
wards France : As a Patriot lie is anxiors
to exonerate his country from those libellous
charges of perfidy and ingratitude, which have
been made agaii.lt her by Genet, Fauchet, and
Adel; ani which hive been aided by the
abominable treachery of many American-
Arnolds, wha have fold their consciences for
French gold, and have belied and traduced
the legitimate government of a country which
13 disgraced in having given birth to them ;
merely that they might find favour in the
light" of the rulers of France; and fhsre in
the general plunder of friends and foes.
That the.American Republic Ihould silent
ly submit to the repeated libels on itsgovetn
ment.and people ; that it should tamely bear
iriftilt and outrage ; appears to be the wish of
those who have grown callous to the-fame in
famous line of conduft : But Heaven be
praised, such is not the sentiment of the
great body of the American people ; nor
such the creed of her ablest champions and
defender*: The fatellite3 of France, thro*
the medium of certain jacobin vehicles of
fonder, have spread far and wide their cal
umnies againlt the eonrtituted authorities ;
charged onr courts of jilftice with violating
the laws of the land, and existing treaties ;
denounced the men whom the citizens of
America have seen leading their armies to
victory in the cause of liberty; or presiding
at the head of our councils.
To refute the charges, and {hew the sals
hood of those calumnies and denunciations,
is a b< unden duty on eveiy than who has time
and talents equal to the task : The latter
falls to the lot of I.eomdas, and it is hoped
he will never be weary in well doing.

LONDON, March 27.
ADDRESS TO THE NATOIN.
Pstman-fquare, March 27/1767.
It w. Bmv intention to have entered my
Protest on the Journals of the House of Lords
the day after I moved my Address to his
majeity for peace, and for that purpose 1
went to the clerk's office, and to my utter
furptife I found that my address had never
been entered upon the Journals. Upon in
quiry I was informed that Lord Kenyon bad
taken it home with him. I wish at all events
that the public should be in pofTcffion of my
Protcft, and I hereby pledge myfelf to my
country and to the House of Lords, that L
will this day, in my place, in that House,
demand the fullcft reparation far this insult,
offered thro me to the <whele House, ia this
illegal and unprecedented manner.
PROTEST.
Dissentient, First, Because feeing no
means of salvation for this country but by
an immediate, Jincere and lajling peace, 1
think the Address, which f moved March
23, 1797Â» calculated to produce that happy
event, and that a refufal to carry that Ad
dress to the Throne, tends to a continuation
of this cruel war, which I hold to be certain
ind inevitable ruin.
Secondly, Because a secretary of Halt's
moving that an address to his majesty on the
30th December, 1796, should be read, is a
poor, weak, and rude manner (tÂ« fay no
worse of it) of answering the arguments ad
vanced in my address.
Thirdly, Because I believe that the argu
ments advanced by me, have never before
been touched upon even in debate, and no
attempt having been made to answer those
arguments, the conclusion which the public
draw from it is, that they are perfeftly
unsnfwerable.
Fourthly, Because it was my fineeie wish
that the eyes of his majesty should be open
ed to the dangers with which he is surround
ed, and that giving peace to his exhausted fub
jeQs, and reSoring to them their rights,
should be his own gracious aft.
Fifthly, Because I have the highest au
thority for every sentiment refpefting the
" ceconomy and reform of abuse?," which I
recommended : namely, his majelty's own
words, in that molt excellent and patriotic
speech made it the close of the American
war, and which 1 quoted in my reply.
Sixthly, Because whenever a nation is in
the situation we areÂ«n at present, it requires
the united energy and public spirit of the
whole nation, tie re establish its credit, and 1
am peifuaded that energy and public spirit
are euly to be obtained by the public pofTef
fmg their ancient free eonflitutian, which
thej so juflly revere ; and I maintain, that
according to common law, which is common
'sense, and according to " the true sprit of the
â¢conflitiuion," which is founded in wisdom,
liberty, and justice, the people in Great Bri
tain have a right, and ought to be fairly and
equally represented in that, which, by its ve
ry name, is their house of Parliament.
Seventhly, Beeaufe 1 hold the borough
system, and every other fyftrm of corpora
tion that has of late years crept into praftice,
to be direftly contrary to the true spirit ol
the conflitution, and big with the molt alar
ming evils ro King and People, and that to
confe.r the honor of peerage on men whe
hÂ»vÂ« no other merit thin that of commanding
Boroughs, and performing Ministerial jobi :
degrades thai high dignity, and tskes away
Â«ce df the greatefl motives that afluates the
' uman mind, thehope of reward, by mak
mgit unworthy the acceptance of those met
for whom it was who I r.vt
1 endured great and diltinguifhed fetviees tc
thtir country, by their valor, their talents
ortheir learning.
Eigfcth'y, Because I amdefircui of fr.aV
ihg ihis public avowal of py pvio. pics,â 1
which nothing on earth (hail make me alter, '
Â»nd which I learn from the aiis and writings'
cf our ancestors, who loved liberty and un- e
derftood it.
Ninthly, Because I am.refulved, whenever f
I fee dinger, boldly and independently, to the 1
full extent of my ability, to difchargc my j
duty to my King and Country. j

" I am sorry to inform you of our illfaccefs
on the voyage. I left Cape Henry on the 25th
of February, and on the 12th of March, five
leagues N. W. of Antigua was captured by a
French privateer mounting two guns and forty
meÃ, who took myfelf and three men out of the
schooner, put a prize-Â«na!ter and seven French
men on board, and brought us to this place,
where, after two days, om- trial commenced â
both veiTel and cargo condemnedâmyfelf plun

ber that have been exchanged with the Englilh.
Our treatment is most intolerable ; worse than
that of the Turks in Algiersâinfultrd by every
blick fcamp,and they protedled by the govern

a blacJt soldier to have a white man arretted for
the smallest offenceâl don't know whit to com
pare it to, for I am sure the Moors in Barbary
have more humanityâAll the black American
seamen are obliged to work for the republic, and
have only three quarters of a pound of bread
and four ounces ot cod filh for twenty four
hours. They condemn all vessels cleared out
for the Weft-Indies, except for Guadaloupe, ;
there has been about ten condemned since I was
here. I have not been able to fee my people
since they were were put in gaol, except one,
who works for the republicâWe are not per
mitted to go to the giol, as they have an idea
that America will declare war against them. If
I were to insert the whole of my ill usage it
would take two or three (heetÂ» of paper They
condemn vessels, some for one thing and some
for another ; any thing will answer if they
want the cargoâThe owners of the privateers
are tke judges, so that everyone trys his own
cause. I foal! be I suppose, some time
in May, and hope to find congress fitting ; lam
i determined to go before theni, and if they will
not give us fatisfailion, nor fuffer us to defend
ourselves, I will never fail under the flag again,
for I am determined "to have fatisfaition at the
risk of my life and salvation.âl have taken
charge of a (hip here for St. Thomas's, where
I (hall make all possible dispatch for home.

NEW-YORK, May 25. , J
The following genuine letter is from a gen- | ,
tleman of intelligence and veracityâits ; j
contents arc highly interelling at this mo- j |
ment. ! ,
Ext raR of a letter from Holland, dated 3c/ tf\ .
February. ( j
Very soon after you wrote the eleflionsof (
Piefident and Vice-President were compleat- (
ed: they have excited in England, in France
and in Holland, a degree ofinterefl and at- .
tention, which proves the rising importance j
of the United Stales. The event has been (
expefted with a degree of feeing, of trepi- ,
dation, of ardent wi(hes in favor of one or j
the other candidate, which has afforded one j
more melancholy proof, of the profoundly .
rooted principle of animosity, which at this
moment arms one half of the hnman race a- |
gainst the other. All the friends and parti- ,
fans of ancient eftablifhmenjs, good or bad, (
throughout Europe, all the adherents of
Great-Britain, all the people who have pro
perty yet left in their hands, all the peacea
ble, moderate and humane, and all the ene
mies to the present French adtninilfration, a
motley mixture, whose sentiments one would
imagine never to concur in any one point,
agree in their wishes for one of the persons
considered as candidates : while all the ad
herents to the present French government, all
those who pant for revolutions, all those who
are by anticipation f ecding upon the plunder
of the present proprietors, all those who are
fattening upon war, and railing ,ortunes up.
on the misery of nations, all the remaining
enthusiasts for democracy, all who desire to
fee the United States at war with Britain, arÂ«
equally zealous in favor of another. They
seem on both fides to fancy, that the detiiay
not only of America, but of Europe, is, in
a manner, suspended upon the decilion, and
both have already indulged in the exultation
of announcing that the choice has fallen upon
him whom they refpeftively favor.
The firfl, ohjeft of our attention at this
time, is the ptedicament in which we (land
towards France. Nothing new nas turned
up, except rumours and reports propagated
by the usual French mechanism lo operate
upon the public opinion. Our American let
ters generally fay, that the latÂ« conduft of
the French government has not occasioned
any alarm in the United States. I cannot
fay the fame of the Americans in Europe ;
many of the friends of our government are
frightened ; and the impreflton produced up
on our (locks ia considerable. Every artihee
of France is at work, and thtre is scarcely
any thing operating to counteraft it. In
general the alarm is heightened by Americans
themselves. . I have, in former letter, given
you a flatement of the interell and motives
which concur to bias the minds of our coun
trymen now in Europe, and informed you,
that Paris has long been the resort of many
individuals, to whom the deftrudtion of our
government, and a civil war in the United
States, are objefts of desire and puifuit.
It cannot be too Arenuoudy repeated, De
caufethe final event depends altogether upon
; this single point of faÂ£f. The French go
vernment have been led to believe that the
people of the United States, hare but a feeble
attachment to their government, and will not
support them in a contest with France. It is
upon the idea of this internal weakness and
division alone, that the French have hitherto
ventured upon their late measures, and, as
they arc (fill flattered with the fame hope,
it is impoflible to ascertain how far it will
. lead them. The event of the presidential
eletfion, as now announced, has exceedingly
mortified them. Upon a train which they
had so long been concerting and laying, they
had founded and been encouraged in rhe mo(t
sanguine expeflalion of fsttling the choice,
The effedl which they certainly did produce,
that of throwing thirteen or fourteen votes
into one scale, which, but for tbem, would
> have been in the other, and their approxima
tion to success, has rather Simulated further
' exertions, than deteired them from repeating
, their experiment. ill success has'pro
voked, without discouraging them, and they
, are afluted, that by persevering and beating
| harder upon us, they (hall compel the Ameii
f can government to submit or furcecd in over
â¢ turning it. I fpesk not from simple con
-1 jeÂ£hirr, but from inferences confirmed by
personal obfervation,and by intelligence tolti
ably direst.
, They know perfeftly well, that if thertiat
-1 ter should be brought to an hoAde iflue, and
i the American people support the measures of
their gorernment, Fnyice muff give up the
1 contest. They know that France, by doing
her worst, cannot eflentially hurt us external
ly ; as to her fending an army against us,
they have not the most distant idea cf it; and
yoti may judge from the iflue of their expedi
tion against Ireland, in a condition their
c naval power is. Ships it is indeed poflible
for them to build and rig; but failots and
1 rmrine officers they cannot make, and tbey
hive them not. This famous Irish expedi
-1 lion, befidctall its preparatory expenses, h*s
cost them three Ihips.of the line, three Attics,
t two frigates, two cutlers* fever.il transports,
] foor or five thoafang' mm, sfria a great dea
of dtrri3gc So all their vjflels returned. Fiom
the firft moment of their failing, until i':e re
tarn of the last tTanfport, every circumilance '
that lias been related of them, or that they
relate thetnfelres, Ihews their totM deflhutino
of naval (kill or experience. One would ima
gine from the accounts, that they had not
un board the whole fleet, a man capable of
managing a fail boat. The French pupers
(till announce verv pompously that gteat pre
parations are making for a second expedition,
but the general Hoche i$ appointed to ar.o- â 
ther command, and if shey venture out with _
their fleet again, it vrili only he to meet with
a more difdttrous fate. As to thei't allies, ,
Spain and Holland, nothirg is to be expcfled
from any concert of operations between them.
The history of the late EHith expedition a t
gainst the Cape of Good fiope, affords two
important incidents from which the conclu
sions are inevitable. That expedition was
planned in concert with the French, and at
three several flations on the paffirge they kad
engaged to furnifha reinforcement of troops. .
at every owe of them they totally failed. 0" I
the very firft appearance df the English fqtiad- <.
Ron, the Dutch sailors almost nnanimoufly t
stripped off their three colsted coi.kade9, fuD- t
itituted the orange badges in their stead, refe
upon their ofHcers, and would not fuffer the ,
admiral to employ the f<ttd refoucre of burn
ing or injuring his (hips, but eotfif>e)led him j
to surrender tiiem up at difcretiun, and seven c
eights of them immediately entered into the r
Briiifli service. The fame temper prevails ,
among the seamen here in the Texel ; and it (
is but a few days ftnee, 1 heard a marine ofH- j
cer fay, in answer to general Rewbell, i bro- ! a
ther of the French diredlorj who was enquir- ; '
ing why their maritime exertions here were so ; ;
feeble : â¢" you know that alraoll all our sailors <
ate against us." 1 n
What fÂ«rt of harmony of operations at fca , I
between France and Spain is lo be anticipa- j
ted, may be judged from the well known cir
cumstance, that many of the Spanish (hips
are commanded by French emigrants, and
when a Spanish squadron lately put into the
harbor of Toulon, some of those officers were
arretted, imprisoned, and with difficulty re
scued by the Spanish admiral from the muni
cipal adminillration of the place.
In this country, the conviftion, as far as
I can judge, is universal, that they have much
to loose and nothing to gain, by a difference
with the United States. Our commerce and
our payments are almost the only resources,
the enjoyment of which is yet left them. In
my ejsnverfations with their merchants, and
even with .members of their government, they
freely acknowledge this, though they as free
ly fay, they fear that they should be forced
to follow whatever France should dittate to
them, and this is unquestionably true. An
intelligent and considerable merchant of Rot
terdam told me, a few days ago, that he was
glad the French government had determined
to intercept our trade with England, because
it would eflentially injure Great-Britain, and
mud be excused by reasons of (late. I asked
him, what he thought would be the conse
quence of an embargo of fix months laid by
the American government ? " It would
bring ns all," (aid he, " English, French
and eurfelves to your terms, but the Ameri.
can government cannot carry it through,"
