PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
WE are not to suppose that the opinion of the ve
majority bf the people can be holtile to their otvh cf
interefr ;or that this opinion, when known, will be ri;
lightly eftimaled, by their repvefentatives. so
It is not however to be expected, that every aft 01
of the Legislative body is always framed, so as to ar
meet the approbation of the majority at the mo- O
ment. It is often theduty of ihofe appointed, to Â«.*, fe
ercife their best judgments on behalf of the public, ei
to devise and enadt laws, refpefting which, they fc
mult depend f6r their general acceptance on the T
perception of the people, of tjieir fitnefs, propriety ni
and intrinsic merit, as these (hall appear in their ar
, operation. The eltabliihment of public schools is
a great objedt, which has been repeatedly p;
difcufied in the Lsgiflature ; it hasbeen ably treat- ,th
ed on in the public prints, aad its individual advo \ r
cates are numerOys and refpeftaiile, ; but, to the G
belt of my recollection there arc no data from T
which any decision can be drawn, as 10 I'ettfe of j n
â¢the majority ofthe citizens of this Commouweilth ar
at large, relative to the fubjedt. a
It is difficult, on any other idea, to "account for hi
the failure of the law, at the last session of the Le- vi
grflature. Surely thole who were opposed to do
ing any thing, and those who lightly gave the bufr- U i
ness liie go by, either entertained an idea that they [ uj
did not coumeraft the sense of the miijority, or 'a<
that the people were indifferent as to the fate of re
the plan. This being the cafe, what is more obvi- c Â«
oully tlie dirty of flie people than this, tkut they w
Ihould unequivocally expt'efs their minds ? Altho' di
the piocrattiaatioii that has taken placc, will be tt
found to have encteafed the obstacles ; and ah ho' m
the artifices of the unfriendly are hard to be tra- g,
verfcd, yet v?e ought as soon to delpair of the com. m

THE FAIRS OF LEIPSIC AND FRANKFORT.
[Fr/lm Cogan's Journey.]
'â¢ You will, doubtltfs, fir,tie when you arc told,
'hat. thtfe two fairs are the g'and marts for the sale
of literature. 1 mult alio acquaint you, that a
large ntimber of manufacturers are kept in pay, in
order to multiply thoughts for the fairs. By these " a
indefatigable labourers several thousands of vo
lumes, r.li forts and fizrs, are annually made up
for sale. The pay is generally by measure, rather to
than by weight, as thejawyers are paid with you,
limply by linrs and letters, whatever these may ex
press. However the prices depend in many in- 1
dances upon the nature of the work, or thi; degree
of reputation the manufaÂ£turer may have acquired. '
Translations aie of the lower order, and will not, arl
as lam informed, fetch more than two rix dollars, Ct
or-twe and a half per Iheet. The next arÂ« small et
abridgments of large works. Then follows the
oppoiite employment, making a large compilation (
from a number of fraaft publications. Sermons us- ' jl
ed formerly to furnifh a small retail trade; but te
these, with treatises on theology according to the u
orthodox fyflem, are much upon the decline. He- av
refy is rilen nearly at par. Philosophical difLrta
tions are also upon the dfcline ; but they (till bear 1
a decent mÂ»rk*t price. General histories are quite tc
a drug. Plays and romances increase in numbers
and value ; and of late the authors of politicalddi- c(
quifitions have conliderAhly taifed their price. _
" You are not to imagine thai a poor author will
venture to trade upon his own foundation. He
cannot wait so many months for his money j nor \
dare he Jo expofehimfelf to the rife and fall of the
market. Mod of them arc engaged and paid by
their principals, who take the whole rifle upon
thetnfelves. An editor of note generally fends a
waggon load of science twice a year Either to
Frankfort or Leiplic, folded as the (heets came
from the press. These are purchased by lefler book
sellers, and distributed ever the country by a third
clsfsof retail venders. 1
" The animal publications at the two fairs a- P
mount to upwards of five thousand volumes ; and *
the number of authors is computed to'be abotitthe z
fa'rne. This is not improbable ; for if your writ- 1
ers of abridgments can turn off three volumes per :
annum, a grave compiler will, on the contrary, la
bour three years at a single volume. A profefied c
writer bf romances may work up about two in one
year; but then your philosophic and metaphyseal d
writers will not be able to digest their fyttems in r
less than three or four years. Thus, by nicely ad
julling and balancing accounts, we may allow that, '
ceteris paribus, every man may supply the commu- I
nity with, tiis volume per annum. !
" As a proof of the zeal and assiduity wirti
â c. which the Germans apply to the futjeft of liteia- '
ut ture, I (hall tranfrnit to you the following particu- I
no lars relative to the conducing of the periodical 1
work, entitled, AUÂ«e>m?inc I.ileratur Zeitung, or 1
â Journal of Geneial Literature, publiflted at jena,.
in the year 1790 ; the number of writers employ- '
ed in tiiat vvoik, including those that died within i 1
the year, amounted to net kfs than three hundred 1
and nine. Of these, one hundred and feveateen
were profeftors in the Germanic and foreigu uoi
he verfities, i.ji ety-fix in high or inferior offices in
vn church and slate, thirteen clergymen, seven libra- 1
be rians of prince's, counts, &c. lixteerr physicians, 1
four doftois of mafic, seven who hsve 110 ptofefli
ft onal charafler. The books reviswed in that work 1
tÂ« amounted to one thousand eight hundred and five,
'o- Of ihefe, one thousand three hundred and ninety- '
V seven were written by German*; four hundred and
ic, eight were Foreign productions; one hundred and
ey seventy.three were publiftied by fellow labourers,
he The coi-efponding members of this literaiy frater
ty nity in different parts of Europe are one hundred
fir and thirteen in number.
is " The Review publiAied at Jena is the princi-
Hy pal, but not the only one. There are several o
*t- .thers by no mean* deficient in merit. Its chief ri
-0 val is the Geltingifdie anxeiu vojigelehrten fachen i. e.
!:e Gotti.igen'i Tidings of learned publications.â
' m These aie puUifhed in numbers, three or four times
of in* the week,-fo ss to fitnife about two hundred
tt' and t;nin a year. This literary journal is upon
a smaller fcaie. than the other. Not mote than fix
or hundred, or"fix hundred and fifty books are re
â¢e- viewed in it annually, but it is well conducted.

<>r ! eal and Statistical Science. It is under the di

" To he above may be added the following ac
count of publications rxpofed to hie at Lcipfic h

ber at the autumnal fair in 1790, was not more
than one thoufaud and fifty-five ;of these 65 were
' mufieal transitions fiom

But at the fair held in the fprtnjr, the number was
more than double, being two thoufond three hun.
dred and forty-eight. In the year 1791, the pub
lications amounted to thvee tmmfand live hundred
and four, exclusive of frhool books, small pamphictr,
and iome works that were'publilhed at theexpenee
of their authors. It is observable, fays my author,
that worksof imagination, and political tlifquifition,
which were formerly the mod scarce, are now he
come the mod popular species of writing.'''

French seemed to have negktfed to occupy it, and tains
the'Auftrian army advanced the more boldly as the
French remained alraoft quiet ab.ut Genoa and the cord,
diflrift between Sivona and that capital, on the tea Thet
fide The main armv of the Auftiians wentidotvn' body
into the Gennoa country by the way of Ovada Bnd
GampoWdo, driving the small posts of the French M
always befoie them. They advanced near the sea Well
fide on the weft of the city of Genoa. 1 lie French aw j
out posts all were driven towards their main araiy, .equ
whose right wing was leaning itfelf on Voltn near noâ¢
the sea, (6 hour 6 from Genoa ) The Austrian nihT.
General Braul'eu thought to mislead by a falfe at- bow
tack made on the right wing near Voltn confiding rorjre
of 6000 French, on the 10th of March, in order b fh
to mafic his intended attack on the centre. The Iha
French General Buonaparte (a young Corficar of its n
25 years, but a man of great military talents) was lion
aware of the trick, and ordered the right wing un- "
der General Cervdni ti retire in the night by a fort- 111 c
ed march to the centre on the right ground of Ma- wal
doona M Savona. Oi the following day (the IOth) v-ift
early ?t four o'clock Beaulieu attacked with 15,000 you
men all the positions fuppo. tiug the centre of the of 1
French and drove them back. At one in the as the
ternoon he attacked the lad retrenchment on Monte vin;
L"zint). The brigadier Rampon with 1,500 moi
French who in the 'pidft of ,be bitde swore fo_ !ian
lemnly not to'foifake Â«!Â»eir pod, defended it so well
that the Auftrians were thrice repulfeg leaving 400
dead and wounded, among them a colonel and ma
ns officers. The commanding general Prouavina
was wounded mortally. On the 12th, in the night, t '" (1
the Frenfth general Laharpe was sent in support of "at
the entrenchment whiHl it was threatened with a
new attack. This was made by the Audrians com- ,he
â  iag down from the heights of Montenotte, in the '
begirininfe with some effect, but loon Laharpc got a" 1
the better. In the mean tim- Buonaparte, Made. lev
na and Befthier, marched to the centre and tbe left jot
wing in the rear of the enemy, when general Mas- | e u
feria took the Audrians already retiring in their left ' *'â 
flsnk and routed them entirely ; so that they 16ft
1,500 dead and 2000 prisoners, amongst these, a
colonel, aid de 6amp of general Argentean, and "â¢
60 officers ; several colours have been lakes. The w
Audrians tvere piiclued the I'iench occupied 1 ;
Carcare Cairo, &c. The enemy was retiiing. r e
This viftoiy has been announced to Ihe National c ";
Convention according to the generals letters from P'
his hea:l-quar'ers, CNrctre. S:me few days after Â°1
it was confirmed by the emptjroi's court gazette, 1
with the usual extenuations, that the Imperial ar-,. cc
my made a motion backwards to occupy their for- a
iner-pofition.
" The second victory is ft ; H more important. It
was near Millefu'a, on the Genoese territory, more w
to the north. It was on the 14th. The Auftri
ans have 1 l,;oo men (2,500 as them killed,
the others prisoners), atnonglt them general Pui- a '
cera, 20 Hats officeis and many oiUers ; 40 "n- j 1

happened in the mod mountainous country, which j a
