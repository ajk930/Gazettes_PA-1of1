MR. FENNO,
I (hall soon take the liberty of submitting
to the public, Propofalt for Jlriiing offfome
engraved copies of abainting which is now
nearly compleated. The original i 9 8 by 5
feet. The engraving, I prop'ofe, (hall be 3
by two feet, and (hall be confided to the
execution of the best artists. I cannot give
a better account of the performance, than
by relating to you the remarks made on it
by two gentlemen who came to view it.â
These remarks I overheard unobserved, im
mediately committed them to writing as well
as I could recolleft them, aud now beg the
favof of their, insertion In your ufeful paper.
NICIAS.
Stranger.âUpon my word here are a great
many figures. It cannot be said of the
painter of this piece, that he was a lazy fel
low ; altho' I believe that it is generally the
caie that painters introduce into their per
formances as few objefts as poflible. I have
heard of a Flemish painter who was three
weeks industriously engaged in painting a
hickory broom. He mud have been very
particular and exaft indeed. This artiftdoes,
not appear to have taken quite so much
trouble. His (ketches have been quickly
made ; but they are striking, and the tout
ensemble is admirable. You will,be fogood
as to explain to me some of the figures. I
do not know them all. In the mod con
fpieuous groupe I fee some fine, chearful,
open countenances ; and recognize many of
the true patriots of America, Wa(hington,
Adams, Jay, Hamilton, Pickering, Knox,
and others. Op a de(k I fee the Proclama
tion of Neutrality. These men have indeed
left nothing undone to preserve the neutrali
ty of the United States. Those insignia de
note that they have been as indefatigable in
perpetuating the peace, and promoting the
true interest, as they formerly were in effeft
iwg the independence of their country.â
With the persons who compose that larger
colleftion, I am not so well acquainted.
The painter seems not to have flattered .them.
Citizen.âAlas ! Sir, for the honour of
our country, the painter has but copied
nature. These people call themselves ex
clusive patriots, and were we to attend to
their profefllons only, without paying any
regard to their a&ions, we might suppose'
that they monopolized all the virtue of
America. Many of them are disappointed,
faftious, envious men, who cannot bear to
fee others in the quiet poflellion of that
confidence, affeftion and esteem of their
fellow citizens, which fhey themselves never
could acquire. Mod of them are of des
perate fortunes, having nothing to lose,
and much to acquire in times of confufion.
Not a few of them are deeply indebted to
Engli(h merchants, and consider a war with
Great Britain as a sponge that will wipe
off their debts. Thiy were men of this
damp who set up the hue and cry agairrft
tfec British government for retaining the
western pods, and for seizing our vessels.
Precisely the fame men spared no trick, or
artifice, to render that very treaty obnoxious
to the people, _ which provided for the deli
very of these forts, and for indemnification
for these seizures. Do you note that flick,
cunning, (harp looking Frenchman ? You
observe that he holds in his hand " Injlrut
ttons for drawing the Americans into a war
with the British, by hook or by crool ?" You
have heard of Genet ? This is intended to
represent him. He is pointing t<3 the guil
lotine, (hews those around him some bags
of gold, and a large parcel of blank com
miflions. Look what a lid of profcriptioni
is nailed to the guillotine, and how greedily,
and with how much savage pleafnre, those
wretches are reading over the names. You
fee him offering to a fat man with white
hair, a fcrowl, entitled " A plan for organ
izing a number of Democratic Societies, which,
by the soâ¢ ce of their united influence, will, vn
quejlionably effeSihe defiredpurpofes." This
person, whose grey hairs ought to have
brought with them.more moderation, once
threw a treaty, after it had been approved
of by the senate of the United States, a
mong a number of the citizens of Phila
delphia, and with the voice of a fury told
them " to kick the Gâd d d treaty
to hâlltaking the citizens for d-v-ls I
suppose.
Stranger.âHe ought, if he thought
them d-v-ls, and one is authorized by his
language and conduft to imagine that he
had the impudence to regard them as such,
to have told them to tale, it to hâll. But
what means that paper, which some mif- 1
chievous fellow has pinned to his back,
with the large words " The great Prrvaleer
and Swindler ; what is got over the devil's
back is spent under his belly."
Citizen.âThis, I suppose, is in allusion
to the privateering which he was fuccefs
i fully engaged in lad war, aod to some fa
mily settlements macie to defraud honest
creditors:
Stranger .That'long faced, larithorn jaw,
half starved Italian, is intended to personate
the hungry wheelsÂ»of-government-clogging
Patriot. Pray who are those who stand be
side him, and are so attentively perufisg the
contents ot the paper which he holds in his
hand ? That paper he seems to have received
from Genet.
Citizen The one on his right hand is
F . ,-ly ; the one on his left hand is Mc.
L n. That person, who is'reading the
fame paper with so much fatisfaftion, is
Sm -ly. You have heard of all these
names at the time of the wefteni infurrettion
iu Penpfylvania. You may judge of the
purport of the paper which commands such
eager attention, by its title, " A plan for
weakening tht f 4 g Iby Jlirring up
an appqfitioiK to the ex. ein the w n
câ l âs of P a."âYou observe a num
ber of figures apparently very much bent
upon something. The person to whom they
are so attentive is Fauchet, the late French
miniver. He wears a collar round his neck
upon which the words " Lord mayor of the
flour merchants," are engraved. He seems
to be dubbing one of his associates : that
person, around whose neck he is placing a
similar collar, is E d R h, of fa
mous memory. The inferiptien on his col
lar varies from that of Fauchet's ; for he is
yclipp'd " The renowned knight of the diflin
guifhed order of flour merchants." Take no
tice how heavy his pockets seem to be. See
those others hattily pressing forward for the
/ame favors. Note those two persons ad
vancing arm and arm. They seem calcula
ted for each other's support. Neither of:
these men could walk alone. The painter I
has taken some pains to express this idea, by â¢
making them link so close together. They '
are both foing to enter into the order of
flour mercnants Both of them are Jaco
bins. The one is an Amer/ean; and many
high offices of government have been prosti
tuted to him. Do you want to know how
virtuous, how ehafle, how sober, and how
hoitejl this man is, enquire in the environs of
Philadelphia, on the banks of the Schuyl
kill, and at the bâk of P a. The
tallest of the two is not an American ; but
I cannot tell you to what country hebelongs;
for as much pains have been taken by peo
ple of different countries to disown him, as
was formerly taken by the different Grecian
cities to obtain the honor of being believed
to haye given birth to Homer. You can
not exasperate an Englifhmtn more than to
fay D s was born in England. Tell a
\ Scotsman that this person and himfelf are j
fellow-countrymen, you will work him into ,
the utmost rage imaginable. You could not I
affront a man of any country more than to j
insinuate that this G r's humble ser
vant and himfelf, were born under the fame
sky. You might as well pull a Mussulman's
beard, or invite a descendant of Abraham to
dine with you on bacon. Look at that lit
tle'fellow who is striving so hard to get fore
moft. He is a celebrated musician, whose
voice has been much improved by a certain
cruel operation. Some twenty or thirty
years hence, perhaps a circumstance of this
kind may be a recommendation to a candi
date for office, and We may then fee over
the doors of certain artists in our city,â
Qui f cajlrano maravigliofimente iputi.
This little fellow has had the vanity to
believe himfelf qualified to take a diltin
guifhed part in the politics of our country.
Reared from the lowest and most dependent
â¢ situation in life, by the patronage of an
eminent and wealthy merchant, he seized
with greediness the opportunity whieh the
misfortunes of his benefaftor afforded him,
to repay the many obligations he owed him
with the deepest ingratitude. Such' having
been the private life of this man, who is a
disgrace to the name, we are not to be fur.
prised by finding him firft in every Jacobi
nical measure adopted against the country
and government.
That is said to be a very striking likeness
of Mr. Bâ r t, who has been recently expel
led from a certain distinguished body, He
is a Jacobin, high in the confidence and fa
vor of his political associates. Very fortu
nate forthe Peace and welfare of the United
States, this man without intending it, has
proved like Fauchet, the marplot of his par
ty. Neither of these gentlemen thought
it worth their while to write their confiden
tial letters in cyphers. Their own"letters
have betrayed them. In all these treache
rous tranfadions you discern none but de
mocrats and exclusive patriots concerned.
Never yet has there been any plot against the
government, oh the people dete&ed, but
some of these jacobips have been exposed.
Yonder the painter has taken the licence
of a poet. That in the back ground is in
tended to represent a palace in Paris, lately
occupied by a nobleman whose fortunes were
prostrated by the French revolution. The
person descending the steps so heavily is our
late Mâr Mâe. - He holds in his hands
dispatches from America ordering him to re
turn *0 the United States. He casts a wifh
ful eye every now and then to the splendid
palace which he is most relu&antly compel
led to quit. HÂ« however, consoles himfelf
with swearing " that he will return to his na
tive country and be revenged upon those who
have so cruelly awakened him from his fafci
nating dream of splendor and wealth." It is
said that the French government expressed
the utmost conccvn at parting with this Gal
lican, Anti-American Mâe. Was it not
very strange the Râof this country should
have received such distinguished marks of af
fe&ion and etteem from those very men who
set their piratical eruizers loose upon our
defencelefs commerce, and ordered their
Râe to insult and vilify the firft officer of
the United States ? The figure yonder
which appears to be so carclefsly Sketched
off, and yet is not more unfinifhed than the
orignal, is a French printer, who has received
the most unbounded encouragement from
the French government. What think you
; of a printer being fuffered to publish a paper,
j paid for and supported by a foreign govern
ment, for the exprcfs purpose of rcvilifig an J
abusing those to whom the people have
thought proper to entru!Hheir gsyermen- j
tal affairs? The painter has drawn on his |
back the outlines of an American frigate ; ;
and from fhuulder to shoulder you fee two
or three broad stripes : Miis is the way that
he has taken to inform us that this man is
the lirft. who ever had' the honor to receive '
the punishment of the whip on board the '
American navy. He is however well paid
for being maltreated in this way, for that
great bundle of rtewfpapers which he is car
rying on his back" are for the French minis
ter, who is said to be a fubferiber for 700 of .
his papers. You fee a little boy pointing
to him and calling out, " that is the son of the 1
â¢would be Pofl-Mafler-General I" I ought |
to explain to you what is meant by this.â
When the press belonging to this printer
was established, it was truly an American,
federal press, and if it ever erred, it. was iu
being too sanguine and warm on the fide- of
governmerft. The very meafyres which
have lince been reviled by this printer and
his correspondents, were then warmly advo
cated by his paper. His father expe&ed, i
the Lord knows how, to be appointed the '
Poll-Matter-General of the United States. '
He was disappointed ; the President think- J
ing, I suppose, that a man might be a jolly, j
jovial foul, sing a good song, and engage ,
with relish in parties of pleasure, without -
being qualified to discharge the irksome du- j
ties of Pott-Matter-General of the United
States. From this moment it was known :
that a different kind of man had been folic- '
itcd to fill this office, from that instant did j
this press (heer about, and it has ever fincÂ£ j
been the receptacle for the most infamous a- j
bufe of the firft and bed chancier* in the â¢
United States. It is impossible to note and 1
explain all the various figures introduced in
to this pietje. I will only detain vou to
look at that figure. Mark him we!l. This
man is a violent jacsbin, and for the honor
of my country, I am hapnfy to fay he is not
an American. Do you fee how h=r4 he is
trying to rub something off of his hands ;
and do you note what that something is ? ,
Look at the brgathlefs infant at his feet.
Do you wifii to know the name of this
modern copyist of England' 3 cruel Richard,
enquire for it in the town of Richmond ?
Do you want a conveyancer, apply to this
â man, for his deeds are written with an ink
that never fades.

from the Texel in the ahfence of Admiral
Duncan, driven from his station by a .gale
of wind. The Circe frigate arrived from
Yarmouth, brought filch intelligence. It
is said, however, that last night Govern
ment received an affiirance to the contrary.
There had been, it appears, some blowing
weather, that had obliged the Dutch to run
higher up the harbour, and on which ac
count also, the Britilh admiral flood for a
short space of time to sea, as hi* fliips, o
tberwife v during the storm, would have had
to encounter all the inconveniences of a dan
gerous lee shore, at rather an unliable an
chorage.
Our readers wijj find in our paper of this,
day, further details from the Paris papers
which we received on Saturday.
The debates of die Council, and the con
duel of the DireAorv t>f France, give eo-
Jour to the fyjipofitjon that /jaipe Y-ioknt ex
plosion will ultimately ensue. The Coun
l cil of Five Hundred continue to reproach
the D're&ory with an intent to influence
their decisions, and to over-awe their delibe
rations, by the presence of an armed force ;
they declare the explanations which they
have received from the Government to be e
â¢afive, unfatisfa&ory and falfe ; and the
fafts they adduce in support of their r.ffirm
otions, not ouly demonstrate thejr jafticc,
but prove, in our apprehension, that the
objeft of the DireÂ£tory, was, and perhaps
stiLl is", to re-tftab!i(h the fiyftem of terror. *
The Council pursue their inquiries on this
interesting fubjed : and the r w mini :
war is employed in afcertainwp from whom
proceeded those orders which aurhorifed tue
troops to pass the limits preferred by law :
for ft range as it 'must appear, after all tl e
communications that have taken place bet
ween the administration and the Legislative
Body, and after the close investigation of a
fpet'al committee, this eflential point still re
mains unexplained.
The Executive Direftory have not been
idle during these tranfadions, they have evi
dently exerted all their influence with the
troops, who have, as we eXpe&eiJ", given
I them afTurance of implicit obedience to their
â¢ commands. An address to the Directory '
from the division under the orders of Gen.
â  MafTena, has not only been- received, but
' published, altho' it is on} of the rr.oft at
trocious and inflammatory papers that ha*
appeared since the revolution. It contains
a gross libel on th#: Legislative Body, whom
it accufesof having violated the contention,
degraded the government, afforded prctt&i*
on to emigrants and priests, rebels to the
laws, and fan&ioned the murder of upright
republicans. It holds out the roost direst
and positive menaces, and threatens the op
ponents of the DireSory with deftruciion.
This paper is nothing less, thin an open
rebellion; and the"condu&of the directory
in fanÂ£lioning its publication, renders them
participators in the crime. It is their duty
to maintain the constitution, and that oon
(litution exprsfsly forbids the army to deli
berate; âthe constitution also expressly de
prives all the members of the republic of the
privilege of colleftivelv petitioning or ad
drefling the direftory or the councils; and
yet the dire&ory have in this nftance, not
only fuffered, but encouraged the army
who are doubly restrained by law as citi
zens and as soldiersâto address thvfti<â
They have therefore violated the constituti
on which they had sworn to defend. In
deed, every thing feema to indicate a dispo
sition, on their part, to eftablifli a military
despotism ; troops are in motion in all quar
ters of the republic, though'they have not
yet ventured to approach the metropolis,
the councils have declared themselves to be *
surrounded by themâth~t a days march,
will fuffiee to bring them to Paris, and to an
nihilate the legislative bodies. In this criti
cal posture of affaires, tranquility can scarce
ly be. expe&ed to be long rfiaintamed.
Our Weymouth letter, received yesterday
mention's a report which prevailed there of
an engagement having taken place between
Sir John Borlafe Warren's squadron and a
French 74 gun &ip, in which that gallant
officer is dated to have loft his life, but thai
the enemy's (hip was captured. We state
this entirely upon the authority of the Wey
mouth letter, and which merely records the
report there of the day. .The .account has
received no confirmation this morning.
August 8.
Yesterday eveniag, a Ifttle before fovea
o'clock, lord Grenville Levifon, aÂ«compaÂ»
nied by Mr. Major, one of hir majesty's
meflengers, landed at Dover from Calais,
and immediately proceeded for town, where
he arrived early this morning. Hia lordlhip
is supposed to have, brought over some very
important communications from lord Mal
mefbury.
We are enabled to state, upon the best
authority, that the Dutch fleet have never
quitted, the Texel, nor admiral Duccan his
station. The captain of the Circe, who
brought the account, wasdeccivedby teak-inÂ£ his- obdrvrftlonv M tfee north of the ,
Texcl, wben the Englidi ftcet is ftatioued ;
to the louth of that river.
Yeflerday at one o'clock, we received by ;
â¢<J:cprefs, Parts'journals ta the sth instant
inclufivc. We immediately ftqpped the press
to coinmtinicate the fubftanco< of their con
tents, which our readers will fiud fully de
tailed iu our paper of this day.
The contents of the!e_papers, which are
extremely important, juftify all the reflefti
ons which we have lately had occasion to
make on the interunl state of France, and 1
the viev.-s of the diiferent parties in that
diftra&ed country.
It appears from the debates of the coun
cils, thst the ftntement given by the direc
tory of the march of the troops towards
the metropolis was totally falfe., Instead of
nine thousand men, said to be detached
from the army of the Sambre and Meufe,
the detachrhent amounted to between twen- ;
ty-fix and twenty-seven thousand men ! Nor j
wns this force intended, as the direftory !
affirmed, for any naval expedition ; but it
Wi.\ fele&ed, as we supposed, for the ex
press purpose of over-awing,"if not'of dis
solving, the legislative body. The soldiers '
indeed, whose minds had been poisoned by !
emissaries from Paris, and by the Jacobin
journals, which were the only papers they
were permitted to read, openly proclaimed
the objeit of their march, and uttered the
grossest calumnies against the two councils.
And netwithftapding the order received
from the minister of war to return to the
station which they had left, they continued
their narch to Paris, in'obedience to the
commands of their general Hoche, who
has by this aft openly hoisted the standard
of rebellion.
Our readers will recollect, that we stated,
some time since, that Hoehe and his army,
known to be determined Jacobins, were the
instruments on whom the directory chiefly
relied for perpetuating their own despotic
power, and for carrying into cffeÂ£t their
own unconstitutional designs.
The direttory also appear to have effectu
ally secured the proteftion of 'the army of
Italy. Addreftcs have been received from
two more .divisions of that army, which
breathe the rankest spirit *f Jacobinism ;
vow implicit obedience, not to the eonftitu
tion, but to the directory ; and devote their
enemies to instant deftruftion. These ad-"
dresses, though the very aft of deliberation
by which they were preceded was a direst
violation of a conftitujional provision, have
been published by thfdireftory, who hare,
, iu consequence, been called on by the coun
cil of five hundred to account for their con
duft. '
Meanwhile a formidable force, supposed
to amount to men, has arrived at
Paris, in ftuall parties ; so that there can
be little doubt but that the direftory will
set the legislative body at defiance, and ef
feftually triumph over the cofiftitution.
Another message was delivered to the
council, on the 2d instant, oh the fubjeft
ot the finances, which are again stated to
be in a most deplorable situation. It seems,
indeed, that the direftory are either anxi
ous to impute this distress to the inefficient
proceedings of the council, or, by a re
petition of meffages'on a ftibjeft so import
ant, to divert their attention from those
vigorous measures which they evince a dis
position to addpt, for confining the govern
ment within the bounds prescribed by the
eonftitution.
Every circumstance combines to fanftion
the fnppofition that some dreadful explosion
is on the eve of taking place. A number of
foreigners have crouded to the capital, and
the terrorists, from the different departments
have joined them. In (liort, that devoted
city now wears the very fame appearance
which it has invariably exhibited previous to
every public corfi motion or massacre finct?
the year 1789. '
Buonaparte, unused to contradiction, has
exprefiTed his,difpleafure in strong terms, at
the' refufal of the Swiss to grant a pafiage to
his troops through their territory ; aiid he
has even threatened to piocure by force
what entreaties have failed to obtain.
Mallet da Pan, to his honor beat spoken,
is pursued with unrelenting animotity by the
French government. He has been com
pelled toliavmMovat for Fribourg, and it is
supposed jfiil'be ultimately obliged to seek
for refuge^n*England.
Reports prwailed at Paris, that the ne
gocialiori at Li fie was fulpended, from the
exorbitant pretcuJions of" the direftory, who
are even said to haVc opesly declared, that,
41 â  the royalist faftion, alone, is desirous of a
peace with England." What foundation
there is for such a report, it is not possible
for us to fay.
We this morning received BrulTels papers
to the 3d inft.
A lettet Jjrom Nuremberg, of the 21ft ult
fays, that the' Suburbs of that city are occupied,
even t6 the very gÂ»teÂ», by grenadiers and Prul

3 tne ijtepe that his further effort? would pr'o

Diet to content themfe'ves for the pre.sent wish
quietly waiting the fefiilt. In fine, his imperi- ,

allv acqajjntirttr them with it by means of the '

It was a gi'Mt error in the Councils to sup
pose that the only queflion in related o
to an inereafe of the army which surrounded
Paris by fix thousand men.
Twenty-five thoufaml men have been led Â§
thither, carrying with them a formidable train
of artillery. These, with the trodps already A
Rationed there, form an army of forty thousand c
men, eight thcufand of whom are cavalry. t>
Very few of them have retreated, and those
who have done so, have only retreated a small
distance
This army surrounds Pari- within fifteen

ran, at pleasure, starve it, by flopping the !Ã¼b

It announces that it has given orders for the ,
issue of the expences of tl decade of 1
Therm idor, which amount to twenty mil
-1 lions, The produce of the receipt in the de
partment! amounts only to ft* millions, leav- 1
ing a deficit of fourteen millions, without
including in that sum the expenees of grow
ing interest. The recepts of the whole
month of Thcrmidor will OBly. amount to
twenty-three millions ; â M and theft fads,"
continues the Directory, " prove the infuf- I
ficiency of the present means. We have
commissioned the minister of Finance to lay
before us a report on the revenue and ex
penditure of the state, and on the means of
eftablithing a just balance between them.
We annex this to our message, and request
you to take it into conlideration."
The council ordered the tteffage and the
report to be printed, and to be referred to
a committee, after being read.
The President announced to the council,
that an infinity of very important objefts ;
claimed their attention, and that th^fitting

. SITTING OF AUGtIST 4.
Delarue.â" I come in the name of your
committee of infpeftors, to make the report
which you required on the march of the ;
troops.
" It refulu from the information we have !
procured, i
1. That from 26 to 27,000 men have 1
been detached from the army of the Sambre ;
and Meufc, instead of 6000, as was said by I
Gen. Hoche.
2. That this force direfted its march to
wards Paris. â â¢
3. That a formidable train of artillery
followed this force, which was to be en
camped at St. Denis, Etampes, and the cir- '
cumjacent places.
3. That the extraordiny expenceincurred
by this march had exhausted the funds of
the receivers in the departments, and parti
cularly that of Marue, whence they exaftcd
the sum of 40,000 livres in fpccie.
5. That several requisitions were levied,
for want of billets, and considerable depre
dations committed.
" The minds of the troops have been
misled and seduced. All the soldiers and
officers prefer the most absurd jnd the most J
injurious accusations against the Legislative ;
Body. Libels are dispersed through the
armies ; the Friend of the Laws,and the Cen
| tinel, are the only Jurnals which reach them,
j Notwithstanding the order to make a retro
gade movement, a great number of troops
j continue .their march to Paris, by order of
Gen. Hoche, and in spite of the opposition
of Gen. Fering, who received a counter-or
der from the minister of war.
"The legion called the Franks, which
was formed in contradi&ion to the law, has
disbanded itfelf, and dispersed 'about the
country. The corps who received orders
to retreat, repair to Paris in small parties,
and without regimentals. Citizen Lefage
appears to have taken a g'eat part in all
these manoeuvres. At Chartes 500 banditti
have been provided with amis and rmmuni
tion. Paris is filled with foreigners, who
are #itrfting for blood and pillage.
" The armies deliberate, correspond with
each other, pass rcfolut'ons, and issue procla
mations, with which all France is inundated.
What has the government done to prevent
all these abuses ?"
The reporter, without entering into long
refledb'ons, proposed to fend a mefiage to the
DircdWy, to ask themâ
1. Whether they have received the parti
culars which they promised, of the march of
the troops ? They shall be called upon to
give an answer in three days.
2. What measures they have taken to
stop the violation of the 27th article of the
constitution, which forbids the armed force
to deliberate ?
The council adopted these propositions,
and ordered the report to be printed.
LONDON. August 5.

J A Correfptndcnt informs us, that several
circumstances have lately tranfpiird, which
give just re'afon to fufpedt that our dearly
! beloved allies have had a hand in the dreadful
Fire which happened at Albany.âHe has
undoubted authority in aflerting that a
Frenchman by the name of Plautan, who
has lately been committed to jail in Pough
j keepfie for stealing, enquired of a petfon
from Albatiy just after the lire, whether the
Recorder's house was burnt?. Upon being
told it was not, he with some ehagth'n
I said " that the original plan has been devi
j ated from." One Jourdan, a Frenchman,
. who lived next door tb the Recorder's moved
| from Albany to Boston a few weeks before
1 the fire, and had his house well insured at
; Boston. From the above circumstances, we
i are led to fu%eft that the n>onfters who

" Aboht the middle of Jtine. the inhabitants

ten companies, and inuijltd the house of Gorier- I
nor Gayofo, although Mrâ  Ellicott used every [
exer'ion to reflrain them from-proceeding to of- j
fen/ive operations. This attaek, which wfs
made tutth a view of forcing the Spaniards to

reiterated his promises of a speedy evacuation of

By the advices -this day published, it is
rendered probable that the conftitution-ms
kers of Sans-Culotte land, that great nurse
ry of pirates, aflaffins and robbers, are, ere
this, once rr.orc blown 'up.
A new, long and violent contest will suc
ceed ; but the ifTue will be favourable to
Franceand tomankindâthe King shall have
his own again, and America and the world
(hall" have peace. Adieu, then, to MefTi
dftr and Prair al, to Pluviofe and
Ventofe, and Sans-culottides, and all the
long train of cabalistic nonsense, which have
poisoned the French name in all quarters of
the world.

CAUTION. 'J
WHEREAS a combination of men in that ' â
county have undertaken to enrich thÂ«m- : t/
felves,by fabricating titles to sundry valuable trafls h
of land, the property of gentlemen living in New , c
York, Philadelphia, London and Faris, for which ! *
trails of lind large funis of money have been paid j f'
to thfcfe fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers â¢ | f
It is therefore just that public information should 1 2
be given, to the end, that the injured may seek re- j 1
! rfrel's while the men have property, and are to be (
found. Those who have been discovered are Tru- j (
man Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re- t
ftde in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and (
fcveral others who go under fiilitious names. 1* h ,
â  supposed that the lands offered fcr sale on those fa- j ,
f bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand 1 ,
â¢ dollars. Such as we have aftual knowledge of are ! i
f OS follows ; Lot! No. II and 11, Otfego patent, I
thousand acres each, the a3ual property of William j
Dcllwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64, ; Â«
- fame potent, thousand acrÂ«6 each, the property of 1
Mr. Ch'aumont, now of Paris, and James Avenll
and others, ol tUt Staoe. There it foine grounds '
t to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
I Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management. âThe Printers will do well to give
' e thita place in their papers, as well to caution the
