Delate on granting leave to Mr. Plnchntj to
receive certain presents.
(Comtudedfrom Saturday's Gazette )
Mr. Rutledge said, that being clofcly
in the bonds of friendfhfp with
h>4 colleague who made the present applica
tion, he did not intend to have said a word
upon the fubjeft ; but when he heard things
of a personal nature introduced into the de
bate, he eould not avoid rising.. And with
due fubmiflion to the chair, he must fay,
that every thing of a personal nature, intro
duced on this occasion, was, in his opinion,
wholly nut of order; particularly when it
was said by a rnemb. r, " if the gentleman
from South-Carolina is not fatisfied with
what he has received for his services, I am
willing to pay him more." The constitu
tion has said, th it the customary presents
from European c nrts fhull not be received,
without the consent of Congress, and ac
cordingly when these presents were offered
his colleague at the two courts of which he
was minilter, he declined receiving them,
faying that he would lay the matter before
Congress on his return home. He had done
so, and he could not fee any ground of alarm
in this. He felt none of that republican
jealousy which his mind to revolt at
these civilities. He rose, if poffihle, to dis
sipate those ideas of danger which seemed
to be apprehended from the adoption of the
present resolution ; the apprehension that it
would break down tht barriers which were
to keep nut corruption from our govern
ment ; and introduce a variety of evils. The
gentleman from Tenneflee had ftatedaftrong
cafe. He had fuppofrd that to allow ihele
presents, might, at some future day, en
courage some person to come forward and
ask permit Tim to receive a title from a
foreign country. Ar dif this fnould be the
cafe, he fe. med to think tVie liberty of the
conntry would be at an end But did not
that gentleman know that the United States
have already given leave to a citizen of this
country ro wear a ribbon and accept of a
title from a foreign power ; but it was a
l'olftary cafe, and lie believed it would fortver
rcm:iiii 10, as he had never heard that this
of aiftincUon excited any thing but
ridicule from his fellow-citizens.
Mr. Claiborne wished to know who the
individual wa .
Mr. R. answered, it was the cafe of the
Chevalier } hn aul Jones to whom he al
luded. The tr.v;fa&ion took place under
the old confedera'ion, which exprefslv pro
hibited titles. But the king of France,
wiAjing to confer some mark of diftin&ion
on Jones for hi- bravery, wrote to his mi-
Viifter here, and he applied to Congress us>on
th\: business and leave was granted to him
to i'eceive the Cross of Military Merit. This
happened in the year 1781. Mr- R. having
afeertained thus far from the Journals
hoped no uneasiness would be entertained on
the ground of danger from titles.
Mr. Harper did not wish to protraft the
debate, but he could not help noticing a
few circtimftp.nces which had given some
gentlemen alarm. He was sensible that
every personal feeling was in favor of the
request ; he therefore viewed with refpeft
that rigid adherence to principle, which had
produced the mistake which their zeal had'
led them into. Gentlemen talked as if none
but royal governments make these presents.
Were they to be informed that every re
public iri Europe, which was in the habit i
of receiving rr.inifters, was also in the habit
of making these presents ? Belides, could it
be believed that if a minillet abroad were to
receive presents, by way of bribes, he
would ever lay them before his government ?
Certainly not ; he would be silent with re
fpeft to any such bribe. Corruption flows
th-ough far different channels from those
which had been mentionedâit flows thro'
the hands of bankers and other agents, not
by means of oftenfibb and customary pre
sents. Andhebelieved ifcorruption had never
flowed in any other way thao this, we fhculd
never have heard of douceurs of 50,0001.
sterling, or of ambaffado s being imprisoned j
in order to extort money from them.
What objeftion, then, is there to allow
ing eur minister? to receive these presents :
It was said we fhou'id be under the ncceffity
of returning them to the ministers of other
countries. In the fame way as when a gen
tleman accepts of an invitation to dinner, he
mull return the compliment by alldng his
friend again. Admitting this to be the
cafe, what then ? Suppose the United
States receive twenty different foreign mi
nisters, and that they are chang-ed every two
years. Th'i would amount to ten presents
a year ; and if we gave a present equal to
that given by the republic of Holland, he
supposed it would be thought very hand
some. They gave a gold chain and med.il,
he supposed about the value of forty Eagles
a year. He did not think this would be
alarming, or any way endanger the liberties
of the country. On the contrary, he be
lieved, the good will which was produced by
this interchange of civility between nations
woi:ld be cheaply purehafed for thirty or
forty EagUs a year. They all knew the
advantages of reciprocal civility in private
life, and it was still more necefl'ary in go
vernments and nations. Have we not, said
he, seen a want of attention to these little
things, alledged as a cause of quarrels and
war ? This hr.d frequently been seen. It
was good policy, therefore, to cherish a
good underltanding with nations, by falling
into their customs, especially when it could
be done without much expence or incon
venience.
Mr. Macon complained of the gentleman
from S. Carolina (Mr. Rutledge) having
censured the chair, without cauie.
Mr. R. Williams denied iiaving said any
thing of a personal nature ; and as to con
inming time in debate, he tock no part in
1" it, until the gfntlemar from Delaware haJ
himfelf made two or three fp cches.
I Mr. Gallatin said this question might be
I confidereel either as ot a personal, or of a
j general' nature. He had heard gentlemen
j arguing both in fuppurt <>f and against the
i refutation', speak of the important services
i rendered by the gentleman from S. Carolina
I in havingaccomplifhedrhetreaty with Spain,
i Nor did he conceive this to be out of order.
He believed however, the gentleman himfelf
was perfectly indifferent as to the fate of the
I question.
I Mr. G. had some doubt with refpeft to
I the conftrnfiion of the coiiftitutioii on this
point. If he was well acquainted with the
fa CI relative to this business, it ftoed in this
way. When Mr. Pincktiey was'fent as en
voy Extraordinary to Spain, he Hill remain
ed Minister Plenipotentiary at the court of
Great-Brilai'n, therefore he was allogether
precluded from accepting of the prefect of
fered to him by the Spanish Government on
his taking leave from that court; but with
refpeft to the present offered to him by
Great-Britain, it appeared him that the mo
ment a minifterreceiveshisletlersofrec.il,
and has taken his leave, he is no longer an
officer of the government ; and in such cafe
both under the present constitution, and un
der the old confederation, presents have been
receive So far, therefore, as relates to
Gieat-Britain, he did not thiuk it was ne
ceifary to apply to Congress for their con
sent.
He had said, that after a minister has re
ceived his letters of recal, there was nothing
to prevent him from accepting a present.
He might be told the constitution is lame in
that refpeft ; but it was more so with ref
peft to private citizens ; because any private
citizen might receive either presents or ti
tles from a foreign power. It has not, there
fore, effeftually (hut out corruption. Offi
cers may receive presents by consent of Cori
grefs ; but any officer or member of Con
gress, might aecept of presents, either in
'lecrecy, or wait till they are eut of office
and then receive them publicly. Nothing
could prevent this, but the infamy that
wc.uld attach to such an aft. Therefore, so
far as it was contended that a disagreement
to this resolution would (hut out a lonrce of
co ruption, it had.little effeft upon his mind.
But there was another point of view oil
this fubjeft, which would induce him to
give his vote agahft the resolution. He â¢ 011-
fidered that if Congress gave its afl'ent to
this propofitioÃ, it would be faying chat
they approve of the aft, and that it is in it
fclf proper that a foreign minister (hould re
ceive these presents. If it was in their o
pinion proper to accept of these presents,
the resolution would be affirmed ; but if
they were Â®f opinion that the praftice is a
bad one ; that it is useless in itfelf, and
ought to cease, they had nothing to do but
refufe to authorize it. He owned it was
proper to keep up civilities, when it could
be done by conforming to customs of an in
offenfive nature ; but when the constitution
flood in the way it ought always to be ref
pefted.
He had another reason for voting against
this resolution. He had already laid that,
if a mai was not an officer of the United
States, he had a right to receive these pre
sents. A question arose whether the gen
tleman from S. Carolina had a right now to
receive them ? He believed he was preclu
ded, not only by their being offered as a re
ward to a Minister, but from his being a
Member of Congress, for he did not believe
that permission could legally be granted to
any member of Congress to receive such
presents ; and therefore that the resolution
ought not to be agreed to-
I he question on the resolution was put
3nd negatived 44 to 38.
The committee then rose and reported
their disagreement to the resolution of the
Senate ; when the question was taken on
concurring with the committee of the whole

At a meeting of the Stsdents of the Col
lege of New-Jersey, held on Tuesday,
May 15th, 1798, for the purpose of
expressing their confidence in the consti
tuted authorities of their country,
Josiah Watson, jun. was oiiofen Chair
man, and
j Theodore Foster Talbot, Secretary,
The following Address was unanimously
agreed to :
To the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.
Sir,
THE Students of the College of New-
Jersey, awfully imprefled by the threatening
1 clouds which obfeure our political horizon,
and well aware of the importance of united
and vigorous exertion, would offer their
feeble, though hearty concurrence, in ap
plauding your administration, and support
ing the energy of government.
We deem it the duty of every American,
attached to the freedom and independence of
his country, to oppose the aggrefllons of
foreign power ; nor is it less incumbent on
those who, though young in years and wil
dorn, anticipate a period, when they (hall
be admitted to the privilege of citizenihip,
zealously to defend their precious inherit
ance. We hope to manifeft to the world,
when the rules of onr inllitution will per
mit, that the youth of Nassau will glory in
defending the independence of their fathers.
1 he national honor of our country, we
eftcem of incalculable value âOur lives we
estimate worthy of preservation only as we
enjoy the independence of freemen. We
view, with the ardent resentments of youth,
the encroachments of fore'gn nations on
our rights. We contemplate, with impa
tience, their lawless depredations. In com
mon with our countrymen, we lament the
neceffify of military operations ; yet, urged
upon them involuntarily, we confidently
trust in Heaven, that the result will be fa
vorable to the cause of freedom and huma
nity- Our grief arises not from pufillani
mry ; it is the offspring of love to our
country. Though we dare brave the in
trepid attack of the hostile army, we forefee,
with regret, the multiplied calamities that
mult result from the conflift.
Although but jtift arisen from our cra
dles, when the French nation broke the
sceptre of despotism, we, Sir, in common
with our fathers, caught the flanve of en
thusiasm, at the profpeQ: of a people efl
flaved for ages, by a succession of tyrants,
at onee claiming their indcfeafible rights
and nobly daring to aiTert their freedom.
We fondly hoped, that the fpiri't which
created, would conduft the revolution. In
this hope we have been difappo'cted. We
have seen the French nation laying aMfi
their firft principles of justice, *nd aiming at
universal empire. We have seen them,
not fatisfitd with fubjugatinjj or ravaging
Europe, crof9 the Atlantic, infsltingly
trample on the rights of our neutrality,
and despise the faith of the most solemn
compaSs. We have feci Ministers sent by
our Executive to accommodate differences.
We have seen those Ministers insulted, and
their friendly offers rejefted. At such con
du<ft, we trull, every American feels thÂ«
warmell sentiments of indignation.
We regard it as a Angular mertfy of
Heaven to our country, at this important
crisis, and as one of the surest pledges of
our political security, that you are placed
at the helm of our affairs. We consider it,
at the fame time, as the reward of your
well tried patriotism and unlhakcn firmnefs.
While therefore, Sir, we express our
highest approbation of the condudV of the
Executive of the United States, in the at
tempts to negociate with the French Re
public, we would also, with ardor, and we
trull with the modesty which becomes onr
years, declare our eoofidence in the consti
tuted authorities of our country. The
choice of the people, we know, will
defend their lights and privileges. To us
there appears no mean of averting the ftornr,
hut we declare we are ready to dedicate oqr
lives to fatigues and dargers in braviag it.
May you long continue to ivatch over the
fafety and order of the community, and may
our fell, iv-citizens never cease to teftify
their liveliest gratitude for the eminent ser
vices you have rendered them.

GENTLEMEN,
I THANK you for your well judged
and well-penned address, whieh has been
transmitted by your Committee, and pre
feuted to me by one of your Senators in
Congress, from New Jersey, Mr. Stockton.
To an high-fpiritcd youth, possessed of
that fclf-refpeA and felf-efteem, which is
inseparable from conscious innocence and
reflitude, whose bodi-s are not enervated
by irregularities of life ; whose minds are
not weakened by diflipation or habits of
luxury ; whose natural fentiment9 are im
prove*. and fortified by classical studies, the
aggrt ffioris of a foreign power mull be difâ¢
gufting and odious : on these fafts alone, I
could answer for the youth of Nassau, that
they will glory in defending the indepen
dence of their fathers.
The honor of your country, you cannot
estimate too highly; reputation is of as
much importance to nations, in proportion,
as to individuals ; honor is an higher interelt
than reputation ; the ma-, or the nation,
without attachment to reputation o. honor,
is undone :âWhat is animal life, or na
tion 1 existence, without either ?
The regret with which vow view the en
croachments of foreign nations, the impa
tience with which you contemplate their
lawhfs depredations, are perfealy natural
and do honor to your characters.
If regrets woald avert the necefiity of
military operations, it would be well to in
dulge them ; but, if the entire prosperity
of a state depends upon the difciplire of its
armies, a maxim much refpedled by your
fathers, you may hereafter be convinced
that the cause of your country and of man
kind may be promoted by means, which,
from love to your country and a fear to set
at defiance the laws of nature, you now fee
cause to regret.
Ihe flame of enthnfiafm which you, id
common with your fathers, caught at the
French revolution, co: Id have been enkin
dled only by the innocence of your hearts
and the purity of your intentions. Let me,
however, my amiable and accomplished
young friends, entreat you to study the
history of that revolution ; the hiftcry of
France during the periods of the League
and the FroÂ»de, and the history of England
from 1640 to 1660. In these studies you
may perhaps find :Â» solution of your di(ap
pointment in your hopes that the spirit
which created, would conduS the revolu
tion : you may find that the good inten
ded by fair characters, from the beginning,
was defeated by Borgiasand Catalines; that
these fair characters themselves were unex
perienced in freedom, and had very little
reading in the science of government ; that
they were altogether inadequate to the
cause they embraced and the enterprize in
whieh they embarked. You may find that
the moral principles, fanftified and fanaion
ed by religion, are the only bond of union,
the only ground of confidence of the people
in one another, of the people in the go
vernment and the government in the peo
ple. Avarice, ambition, and pleasure, can
never be the foundations of refotmation or
revolutions for the better. These paffioni
have diaated the aim at universal domina
tion, trampled on the rights of neutrality,
drfpifed the faith of solemn conjpaft, in
sulted Ambassadors, and rejeaed offer's of
friendfhip.
It is to me a flattering idea that you
place any of your hopes of political secu
rity in meâmine are placed in your fathers
and you, and my adviee to both is, to pladfe
your confidence, under the favor of Heaven,
in ypurlelves.
Your approbation of the condÂ»a of go
vernment, and confidence in its authorities,
are very acceptable : If the choice of the
people will not defend their rights, who
will ? To me there appears no mean of
avei ting a storm, and, in my opinion; wctnuft all be re;,dy to dedicate o- ifdves to
fatigues and danger!.

Gentlemen, Sh;
An address Jo cordial and tefpeftful as this from I>ri
the citizens of Neivbern, and your warm appro
bation of my condud, since 1 have filled the of
fice of chief magijlrate of the United States, / P' 11

iv?th difficulty and danger ; -when neither Jkill
in the management of affairs, mare improved than " ,a
any I could pretend to, nor the put ejl integrity of ri
intention, couldfecure an entire exemption from 0
involuntary errot\ much less from censure.
There ha ve been, for many years, flrong indi- P â 
(ations that nothing would fatisfy the rulers of the
French, but our taking with them an aftive part con
in the war againfi all their enemies, and exhaujl
ing the lajl resources of our property to support den
them, not only in the pursuit of their chimerical
ideas of liberty, but of universal empire : this we P a P
were tint only under no obligation to do, but had
reason to believe *would have ruine de laws, Ga P'
ton flitut ion, and the mi?a Is of our country, as well
as our credit and property. P orl
dn ardent enthufwfm, indeed, deluded for a
long time too many of our Worthy citizens. P a P'
The honor of your teflimony to the integrity of
my endeavours in f t difficult a conjuncture, is -ve- n
ry precious to my heart.
A r the Mile views iind nefarious designs of cont
the French Republic are now too notorious to be
denied or extenuated, / believe with you, that corrt
the love of out common country will produce a
cordial unanimity of sentiment. cleai

MR. FENNO,
The rverfion to war so difcoverahle in the peo
pie of the United States, may be regarded as proof /5 P Â°
positive, that they have not imbibed thofc fangui "arn
nary principles which charaflerize the new fang Comp
1 led republics. To this avcrfion mufl be imputed â¢ ot
. that wonderful lacility with which men of found Comp
i , judgment and approved patriotism prevail upon Comp
themfelvesto accredit every report which favors of like
peace. , Plated
I was induced to make thefc observations by Spur I
1 observing, that.some persons have attached a de
gree of importance to tfte letter from.-our Consul Aqua;
: at Amsterdam, pub lifted in your paper of yester
day, which it by no means merits. That the
French government should cause the (hip Ameri
ca to beieftorej, is easily to be acccounted fÂ»r,
when we consider, that the" molt certain means
which the Dwtch peffefsof discharging the thirty*
I two millions of Refcriptions, fa obligingly offered to
us, are derived from the commerce they carry on
through the medium of neutrals.âBut abflra&ed ma y
from this consideration, it is to be remarked, that
the circumstance of the America's being captured r> r
; in fight of the Texel, was calculated to excite ge-
. neral alarm, and thereby prevent all further fhip
j ments t<* Holland. What good Democrat could
j not release one cargo in order to entrap a hundred ?
I The letter from the Consul also mentions, that
' our Envoys hh4 had several coÂ«fÂ«reÃces with M. "
1 Talleyrandâbut whether thcfe conferences were J)
subsequent ta those which have been published
here is not known. Admitting, however, that r\ 1-
; rhey werfe, 1 fee no reason why we (hould flattar â¢ , C
ourselves with a favorable issue, when it is not 'Â« â¢ e
cvan pretended that our wa.voys had been accredit- vflr 1
ied To the extract of a second letter'without 1 r N .
date, laid to have been received frqm the consul '
: bating that Mr. Gerry hid informed him, " tb.it
the negtciatiin appeared to be in good train" I lhall
Â»>ppofe the authority of another extrad of a letter Likei
from the fame gentleman, dated February 24th, fame oc
i 1798, which letter is not at Boston, but 'actually may
!in Philadelphia. The extradl is as followsâ" Mr. WILL J
Gerry "writes tne lately tbey cxpe&faon to leave France as fcy
tbey went" lt is with the public to decide which A
