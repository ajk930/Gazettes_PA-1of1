SIR,
Having been recently refloTed from tbe brink of
the grave, by your invaluable medicine, 1 think it
rÂ»y duty to make this public acknowledgment of
the fame, for the benefit of others afflided with a
similar complaint. Â° I had been afllidlcd with a iinltk
dreadful allhma for about twenty-three years. I
; s never for years got any reft, my cough was so ,
~ troublefoir.e in the night; *nd used to discharge an
almost incredibU quantity of glutinous matter
from my lungs ; and my breath was so exceeding
)r ftiort that I could not walk across my room. Pro
videntially hearing of your Cough Drops, I took
them ; and, through taking them alone, I am now,
w bUffed be God ! restored to perfed health. My

'â¢ If i fubmiflion to the laws, is a charac
reriftic of good' citizenship, if heavy bur
ftens are submitted to from the mod patri
otic moves, the merchants of are
certainly entitled to protection from their
government.
The faft is, they are f<> quiet a set of
people, that were it not for news-pr.per pub
lications, their fiifferings wohIJ not be
known to the community ; *nd tho' com
merce is foundation and support of our
whole revenue fyflem, yet are tht mer
chants fuffered to be plundered by row boats
and canoei, to pay extravagant premiums
of insurance, and reduced to the degrading
situation of foKciting or paying Britiih crui
zers for the proteftiorv of their veflels. At
this moment, when arrivals from China and
India, with cargoes of an immense value
may soon be expe&ed, when many of our
vessels are beating on our coasts, when a
large and valuable fleet only waits the open
ing of the navigation, our rulers are deba
ting upon pafil expenditures, and refufing a
paltry appropriation for completing our fri
gates which would afford an immediate pro
teflionâThe very money expended in idle
' i debate would do the business, as the sum
j necessary Would scarcely exceed the differ
ence of premium paid between convoy or no
convoy, which to an English port in Hif
paniola, is 8 to 10 per cent.
The fate of our commiflioners is now too
well known, and let the disgrace of preven
ting defenfive armaments, be ascribed to.the
misguided and impolitic zeal of Frenchified
Americans, who, regardless of the trup
interests of America, or from pulillanimous
or worse motives, c!Â»g the wheels our
government. An enquiry into the expen
ditures for the frigates may be inftitutedat
ar,y moment of leirure ; no doubt remains
of their being immense, extravagant, and I
may add (hameful, but when all is done but
a few tboufand dollars : Is the question now
to be, " whether to grant this addition, or
to go into an enquiry into Mr. Francis's ac
countsâNo ; rather let us in onefolitary in
fiance follow the example of our dear fifier
France ( which has kicked our ministers) and
give the frigates to the merchants, or if that
will give offence to Mr. Bar,as let the mer
chants arm their own (hips.
MR. TKNNO,
The following ex traft from a late publi
cation intitled " a journey over land to In
dia, by Campbell." is so applicable at the
preient moment, as induced me to trauf
cribe it for your paper : had Mr. Campbell
travelled in America, he would have found
those citizens of the world, called democrats,
not so thinly fo-wn, and that such characters
hold (not confidential but) lucrative offices
in our government.
" I have, in the course of my life met
with many people, who, under the plausi
ble pretext of liberality and greatness of
mind, have called themselves citizens of the
world, and declared that the country where
they lived, be that what country it might,
was theirs and demanded their allegiance
and protection : but I have always shrewd
ly fufpefted, that such men aft from a con
sciousness of being outcasts of their own
countryâand scorned or rejected by their
fellow citizens, would retaliate Jby affe&ing
to deny their natural attachment.
" There are men who neither love father,
moth:r, filter, brother or connexion : such
however, are, thank God, very thinly sown
in this world ; bat except it be a few such
unnatural people, lam convinced that there
is no one whose heart does not confefs the
patriotic paflion, and burn with a flame
more or less ardent of love for his country.
My predilections that way 'are naturally
strong, and I am now happy to refledt that
I evinced them by the most unequivocal
proofs ; had I not, I were indeed, in my
own opinion, fit for any punifliment howev
er ignominious ; and to all such as lift their
arms against their country, I will fay in the
words of tfte poet,
" XrOtrfrty r.orc~âaiu,uUn all mcmcrji .
" On horrors heady horrors accumulate ;
11 VÂ° fed* mat* beav n weepâall earth amaz'Ji
bor nothing can J! tbou to damnation add y
" Greater than that.""
Mr. Fenno,
One of your brethren of the type lately put
into my hands a publication entitled " Young's
Eflays on interesting fubjefla" for perusal, with
a request that I would give him my sentiments
on the probability of its being generally bought
by the reading part rtf the communityâl read
it with increasing pleafore as I proceeded, and
when flnifhed, 1 returned it with this answer,
th3t if the book were generally read, it would
probably be the belt antidote that his yet ap
pea red to ttie poifrifi of the modern political,
deiftical philosophy which is making as great a
ravage in the moral, as the inhuman war now
raging in Europe, does in th-i natural world ;
that if he printed it I would take a dozen or
two to fend to my country sri ends ; but know
ing how little, how much less attention is paid
by the friends of order and good government
to the propagation of their principles, than by
their adversaries the anarchists, I feared to giye
him more encouragement.âWhether he will
go on * ith it or not, will probably depend on
the advice of other fricmls whom he may con-
Cult ; but I could uut forbear asking his leave to
take a t w txlrafts,one ofwhich I now inclose,
and if you ftould shew your approbation of it,
as I hope you will, by an early nfertion of it in
your paper, I ft;ll fend you some more
of the lame, but not so long or so frequently
as to overload y.uir paper, or foreftall the pro- .
posed edition. 'Vours, &c. .

Extract from feting'j EJJdys on intending ful*

fclTav on govcrnm.ni in general, and the fub
jeclion which chrillians owe to the powers
that he. r
" I" this enlightened age, few will call in
quiflica the truth of that important maxim, that
all power ami authority art radi.aUj in the peo
pie I hope few Â«-iÂ» <^ r dl 'P" tc 11 t ' me
cope- ycapk om,.u,n hÂ» an undouto
edwshtJjP choose and eretf phat form of gov
ernment the, fiad mo ft Wenmtt' Â»d to
triift tke aa.niniltrat.ou of it; to what hanrf,
they please ; and in this right every individual
hl7hi, (hire. Bin from this maxim, if not
rightly ijfderftood, we *uy Hnw cone ufions
which the premifc wiM not hear ; eonclufiott
which neither consist with truA, nor wit., the
peace arid well-being of society. A tew of them
may be pointed out.
Â« pifjt. i t doeÂ» not hence f>!low that all gov
ernmer.ts have been anally <ct up by the ge
neral vÂ«ice of the people, or even with their
universal coufeut. Though in point of thÂ»ory,
the people's ripht cannot be denied ; yet it is
plain froiji what has |)een said, that in fail, this
right hasf'eldom been exerciled or ev< u claimed
in the erection $f any government. In rnofl na
tions of ftw world, th<f people never to this
dreamed that they had such a right; and how
fliould they exercise it! Even wl'ere h<* been
experienf ed, it cannot be fiipppfed. rata vhole
nation was ever unanimous in their choice
Some individual* wot>ld always have preferred
a different form of government, would rath
er have employed other hands in the admimf
tration ef it. But it would be absurd to suppose
that this minority,.becauff they did not actual
ly concur in erefling the government, should
enjoy the benefit of its protection, without be
ing obliged to submit to its author ity, or to con
tributes its support.
"2d. It does not follow, that it is mall for
the benefit of society that the people should re
tain the exercise of that power, or any conside
rable part of it, in tl%ir own hands. To govern
a nation mult require talents, education and ex
perience, beyond what nfually falls to the lot ot
those in the subordinate ranks of life, in the most
enlightened nation in the world. Common peo
ple may Speculate about affairs of Rate at their
fire fide; but the weight Â®f government is top
heavy for their (houlders. Were our belt coun
try politician placed at tha helm of public af
fairs, he would soon find himfelf unequal to the
talk. Neither would this be remedied by em
ploying a great number of such persons in the
business; as the diversity of their opinions would
add to the confufion and embarrassment. A
man must lerye an apprenticelhip before he be
qualified to govern nations without any instruc
tion in the art. Is the&ience of politics more
fimple,or more easily inquired than an ordinary
handicraft ? Or is it eafler to managt affairs of
state than to make a pair of (hoes ? Every man
surely has a right to choose bis own shoemaker j
but will that man a<ft wifely who (hall employ
one for that purpose who never knew how to
brittle a thread ? Yea, every man has a right, if
he pleases, to make his own Ihoes ; but are the
rights of man violated by his wearing (hoes of
another man's making ? In like manner, tho'
all power belongs radically to the people, their
right is n#t violated by tommilting the adlual
exercise of their power into the hands of a few ;
and the sooner the body of the people dived
themfelveJ of that pfTwer, if it iÂ» intruded in
proper hands, the better.
"3d. It doss not follow from this maxim,
that after a particular form of government hÃs
been set up, with the consent of the body of the
people, that the people have a right to abolifli
it, and set up another, as often as they please.
It has been pleaded by the friends of liberty, and
no true friend of liberty will deny it s that all
government n founded upon a mutual
between rulers and people j and that such a
compact, eilher express or implicit, subsists
wherever there is a lawful government Now
it is plain Â«o every rational understanding, that
neither party has a right to tweak or dissolve any
contrail without the confiÂ»nt of the other. â
Hence it has been arg,ued with justice, that
when kings or other rulers violate that origiual
compact, they forfait their right to govern ;
the people may displace and even punish them.
But may it not be argued with equa justice,
that if the people, or any part of them, violate
the compact on their part and refufe to fulfil
their flipulations to governmentthen govern
ment has a right to consider them as having for
feited its ptote<2ion, and to punish them. Un
less this dÂ«Slrine is admitted and reduced to
praftice, there can never be ltrength or liability
in any government.
JVe (hall be told that " rulers were made for
the people and not the people for them ; jhat
they are but servants of the public ; and that
every man has a right to dismiss his servants
whenhepleafes." True, rtiagiftrates are servants
of the /late, or if you please, of the people, and
were made rulers for the people's good. But
as the people are not Haves to their rulers, so
neither are rulers (laves to the people They
serve by contrail."
C 0 N G R ESS.
HOUSE QF REPRESENTATIVES.
MONDAY JANUARY IÂ£.
(Continuation of the Debate on granting fur
ther appropriahtnsfor the Frigates.)
Mr. Livingfton said, from the full dif
cuflTon of this fabjedt, which, though inci
dentally produced, had taken place on a
former occasion, he did not think it would
either have been becoming, or neceflary, to
have again stated the retifous which gave rife
to this resolution, especially as he felt an a
version to fay any thing which might be un
neceflary, or which might tire those who
heard him. Mr. L. said, that he had be
fore observed that the patience of the house
had been worn out by the repeated applica
tions which had been made for money for
this objedt; that the expence had exceeded
all belief; that the most extended imagina
tion could not have conceivedan amount like
that which Congress had from time tÂ« time
been blindly led to appropriate. But the
proposition was objefted to, because it would
call an odium upon our officers. This he
was perfectly indifferent about. Whatever
might be the private opinion he had of the
charaiSers of these officers-; however inca
pable he might believe them of doitlg wrong,
or of afting corruptly, yet, when l.is duty
called upon him to make an enquiry into
the expenditu re of public money, he was
deaf to all confederations ofa personal nature.
But, uÂ» this cafe he did not fee the necessi
ty for this remark. The house had been
told (he believed by the gentleman from S.
Carolina himl^lf) that the extraordinary ex
pence had bein occalioned by our inexperi
ence in business of this kipd, by the high
price of labour, materials,' &c. If this
were the cafe, the result of the enquiry
would be honorable to those concerned,
highly fatisfadtory to the house. It was a
proceeding which our public officers ought
to wish for ; nay, gentlemen fay, theyÂ°do
wi(h for it.
But Mr. Li. said it had been aliedged,
that the statements ordered a year ago to be
laid before the house during the firft week
in this month, should be waited for, before
any enquiry took place. He would reply,
if tliefe officers had nÂ«t in the mean time,
ABed upon the'houfe for a frefh supply of
money, this enquiry would not have been
thought of. BeGdes, the accounts asked
fer the lall year, would not give the latis
faction required. The requell only extend
ed to all the expenditures previous to the Ift
of January 1797. The house would wish
to knovv what had heen expended since, and
they had no reason to expedl further infor
mation than was asked for. Mr. L. said
every member who was present at the time,
mull remember that whenever the house had
been applied to for farther appropriations,
tfiey had. heen-Luld iiiiU the frigates would
be ready for sea at such and such a time ;
and that they would then bear our flag tri
umphantly over the ocean. And yet, tho'
the house had been fourQr five times deceiv
ed by these representations, they were told
there was no ground for enquiry. For his
part, he should consider himfelf as negledting
his duty, were he not to call for this enqui
ry immediately ; for if .the house were to
wait a week for the statements called for,
they might wait anotherfor their beingprint
ed; they might then be found deficient,
frefh statements might be neceflary, and the
session might expire, without effe&ing the
wished for enquiry. He thought all parts
of the house ought to favour the enquiry ;
for, he believed, if it should appear that
frigates could not be built for less than
500,000 dollars a piece, the projedl of a
Navy ought to be given up ; but if, on the
other hand,-difficulties and had
occurred in the commencement of this busi
ness, which would not return, and that fri
gates may in future be built for half the
sum (which was his opinion) there would
be some encouragement to proceed in the
business.
Mr. Sewall was sorry that the gentleman
from S. Carolina (Mr. Harper) had given
the occasion, and that the gentleman lalt up
had so eagerly seized it, to thwart any mea
sures which might be neceflary for the gen
eral defence, by ridiculing the refourees of
the country. The present, he said, was a
time of danger and apprehension, and thus
to talk of the refourees of the United States
added to the apprehension and the danger.
The gentleman from S. Carolina had said,
that to pass this resolution, would be to pass'
an odium upon our public officers. He did
not think so. He thought an enquiry of
thi3 kind at all times proper, where there
was any doubt as to the expenditure of mo
ney. He agreed with the gentleman from
New-York, that the enquiry (if it had a
favorable iflue, which he did not doubt)
would forward the design of providing a na
vy ; as it would appear that the extraordi
nary expence? had been such as it would not
"be neceflary to incur in future. He was
therefore, sorry to hear the gentleman firft
up (Mr. Williams) fay he should be disin
clined to vote any further appropriation, un
til he saw how the last had been expended.
However improvidently the money already
appropriated had been expended, yet, in
order to secure what had been voted, and
to keep the work in progress, they ought
to vote a further sum, as soon as wanted,
whether the statements called for were re
ceived er not.
Mr. Livingfton desired to know wherein
he had attempted to ridicule the refourees
of this country ? The gentleman from Mas
sachusetts must excuse him when he affected
he had never made a more hasty or unfound
ed charge. If he had either ridiculed the
refourees, or thwarted any measures for the
general defence of thq United States, it
must have arisen from a weak judgment, and
not from any intention of doing so. But
he was certain nothing had fallen from him
which could be so construed. *'
Mr. Sewall acquitted the gentleman from
I New-York from any intention of lowering
the appearance of the refourees of this coun
try ; but he appealed to the house whether 1
he had not spoken of this fleet with a de
gree of ridicule, when he represented it as
governing the ocean. It appeared so to him,
.at least.
Mr. Harper again insisted upon the im
propriety of going into thismeafure, from
reasons similar tothofe which he had already
given.
Mr. Gallatin said, that the groynd taken
by the gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr.
Harper) would prevent any enquiry what
ever ; for he stated, that the house ought .
not to pass the present resolution because
certain statements had not been received,
and because to pass it would be to imply a
censure on our officers. So that, on this
ground 110 enquiry could be gone into with
out statements,. as the house could not ob
tain statements without passing a resolution,
that resolution would be construed into a
censure, and therefore ought not to be pas
sed. This, Mr. G. thought a very impro- I
per dodtrine. It would never be in the pow
er of the house to decide upon the propri
ety of statements by barely hav!ng them
l?id upon the table. The proper mode was
to appoint a committee to enquire into the
.fubjedl, and an appointment of this kind
never ought to be cotiflrued into a censure
upon any one. He agreed with the gen
tleman from Maflachufetts, that the propo
sed enquiry might favour the extension of
the navy eftablilhraent, if the extraordinary
expence Ihould appear to have been tempo
rary and unavoidable ; but he owned this
was not his only objed in wishing for the
enquiry. He could not help drawing con
clusions from the information which he re
ceived ; and the conclusions which he had
drawn frotnthis information was, that either
the officers who had made the different state
ments with refped to the expence of finifh
ing the frigates which had been said before
the honfe, had either deceived them, or the
expenditure of the money had been mifma
ged. He might be as this was
only conjecture. He wished the enquiry
to take place, therefore, that this fufpicidm
iâ I" 1794. he said, they were trfM.u
: 688,000 dollars would be fuffir'
there had been a mistake \ n tK , r med
but that with 80,000 d o ll 4rs h l bU,,n f S '
would be finifhed. In January 17 * T
' house was again called upon for
dollars ; in July in the W l^ 2 '? 0
200,000, and now f or 1 ?0 OQ( ? * ' tor
i M , r - ?' f C Vi Â° nclud , c db y fa ying, that he a
| greed with the gentleman from MafTachufetu
)v i sto n t ic,iie ihe "fo arc
| of thÂ« United States ; but that gentW,,
jmuft agree Â»th him that it was ofi rapor
tance that the pubhc should be well
med as to the expenditure of pub l i(; mo " ,
that a judgment might be formed whether
our resources were properly applied, or whe
ther they were employed upon objefts w h; ch "
could never be of any real utility to th
country, or upon objeds which might tend
to weaken, rather than to strengthen u -
This enquiry, he expeded would in s om *
degree, give a declfion to this question, as ; t
would shew whether the great expence which
had been incurred, was unavoidable in a bu
finefs of this kind, or whether it had been
owing to temporary causes only. It tou ld
not be wrong, Mr. G.'faid, at any time > 0
explain to the people of' the United 4 States
what their resources ; this could do nc> harm
but goodâit was of the firft importance
that, in this refped, as well as others, the
truth fliould appear He hoped, therefore 6
the resolution would be agreed to.
Mr, Dana was in favoy.r of the enquiry
forfomeofthe reasons which had been affiga'
ed by the gentleman lad up ; and he fhsuld
not have spoken upon the fubjett. had he
not thought the remarks which had fallen
from the gentleman from New-York and
Pennsylvania upon our public offirft;, de
serving of notice. He did not know that it
was necessary for the gentleman from Penn
sylvania to mention his suspicions that our
officers had deceived the House of Repre
sentatives in their ftatemcnts, which he ac
knowledged was founded only upon conjeft
ure. He had observed several other insinua
tions which must be painful to our officers.
He could have wi(hed that no ebje&ion
been made to this enquiry; tho perhaps, it
might have a good effeft, since it had given
gentlemen an opportunity of fpeakiag their
own eulogy, which would doubtless" more
than compensate any pain which their sus
picions might give to deserving officers.
Mr. Venable wished something to be said
in this resolution as to the time which had
been consumed in building the frigates, as
well as to the expence incurred. He there
fore, moved to amend the resolution, by ad
ding " also the causes which have produced
the delay in finifhing the fa me."
The motion wa3 agreed to wlthont a di
vision, and a conurrittee of five appointed.
A new petj'tron was presented from Anna
Wel(h.â r. â 
On motion of Mr. Williams, the house
again resolved itfelf into a committee of the
whole on the bill for the relief oÂ£the refugees
from Canada and Nova-Scotia. The bill
underwent several amendments, the chief of
which was, the striking out the clanfe which
provided for all pcrfons, whether male or fe
male, who were 14 years of age when they
emigrated, and substituting in its place, "
all heads of families,, and other male per 1 -
sons above the age of 21 years," and " all
persons whe were members of families when
they came into the United States, but who
afterwards entered into their service." The
quantity of land apportioned to the firft
class of persons, viz. those who loft and fuf
fered most, was not to exceed 2000 acres ;
to thole of the last glass 300 acres ; The bill
was finally agreed to, and p:\ffed to a third
reading, which it is to have to morrow.
A mefTage was received from the Senate,
informing the house that they had palled the
bill for the relief of John Frank, and that
they infilled upon their amendment to the
bill for paying the interest due to Gen.
Kofciulko.
The House took up the last bill, and in
filling upon their disagreement to * the Se
nate's amendment, a committee of confer
ence was appointed. Adjourned.
TUESDAY JANUARY 16. jj
Mr. Grifwold, from the committee to
whom was referred the memorial of John
Spafford and others, who wished to be al
lowed to purchase land of the United States
on different terms from thÂ»fe prescribed by
law, reported against the objeft of the pe
tition, declaring it tube their opinion, that
the government could not dispose of land
in any other mode than such as was by law
dire&ed, and that individual applications
for the purchase of land could not be admit
ted. The house concarred in the report.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
claims, made an unfavourable report on the
petition of William M'Kinley, which was
concurred in by the house.
. The bill for the relief of British Refu
gees from Canada and Nova-Scotia, was
read the third time and pafTcd.
Mr. Macon wished to propose a resolution'
for the adoption of the house, for the p" r
pofe of having it referred to the fame com
mittee of the whole to whom was referred
the report on tjje petition and remondranc;
csf the state of Tennessee. It was to the
following effedt â¢
"Resolved, That.the sura of
dollaVs ought to be appiopriated for t .e
purpose of defraying the expence vvhii-h ma)
be incurred, in forming any treaty or treaties
which the President of the United States
may deem it expedient to hold with the In
dians claiming lands within the state of 1 en
neffee."
Mr. Macon said, he was induced to make
this motion at this time, because when a
similar propolitior. was offered in the com
mittee of the whole it was deemed to e
out of order.. But as it was now well knownchat the Preficerit hsd appointed cotwriif
ftoners for balding a treaty, be believed it
would be best so make an appropriation in
the usual way to enable him to carry it in
to effedt!
The motion was agreed toÂ»
â  Mr. Gregg proposed a resolution to the
following effeft: ,
*' Resolved that the c#mmitte^of Claims
be direftei to enquire into the expedifcney
or extending the aft passed in June, 1794,
entitled an aft in.addition to an aft for ma-
Sing further-provition for the protection of
ic frontiers of the United States so far as
it relates to the affording of relief to the wi
dows and children of officers and soldiers
who were killed in an aftion with the Indians
of the Ohio, and report theiY {)-
pinion thereon."âAgreed".'
Mr. Fowler presented a petition from
John Campbell, praying for compensation
for wood furnifhed to troops of the United
States in the year 1793. Referred to the,-
committee of Claims.
Mr. M'Dowell rose to call up the resolu
tion which he had laid upon the table a
week ago, refpefting the impeachment of
William Blount, and which had been defer
red, from the afiiirance which had been
made to the house that the chairman of the
committee appointed on that fubjÂ«ft, would
be in his place yesterday. Finding that this
was not the cafe, he renewed his motion.
Mr. Harper said, that he understood, at
the time he said so, that the chairman of the
committee would be in his place yesterday.
He yesterday, however, saw a gentleman
from Eafton, who had conversed with that
gentleman 011 Saturday, and he informed
him he fhouldfet out from home on mon
day morning, tjjat he expefted him in town
this day.
Mr. Bayardcould not discover the motive
oÂ£ the gentleman from N. Carolina in press
ing so closely this business ; for his part, he
could fee 110 public good which could be de
rived from accelerating it in tire manner pro
posed. When the business was firft brought
forward, he was kept'from the house by iu
difpofitipn, and therefore had not an oppor
tunity of fpcaking to it. It was well known
that the business of drawing the articles of
impeachment belonged to the chairman -
That they were not drawn earlier, he be
lieved was ov\'ing to the peculiar situation of
the person to be impeached; He was held
to bail by the Senate under the penal sum of
2COO dollars; and it was well understood
that when the articles of impeachment
(hould be exhibited against him in the Se
nate, he would not appear; and except he
did appear at that time, it would be impos
sible for the house to proceed with the im
peachment. This view of the fubjeft had
created a lukewarmnefs in the committee.
Had they been impressed with the idea that
the business could have been prosecuted with
success, he believed the articles of impeach
ment would have been produced at an ear
lier period of the session ; but as they con
sidered the farther proceeding iri the bufi
uefs as a mere matter of forâ¢, they had been
the less anxious about it. Under
of the fubjeft, and as the chairman would
most likely return in a day or two, he sub
mitted to the gentleman from N. Carolina
aÂ»d to the house, whether it would be pro
per to prefsthe business at this time.
Mr. Nicholas hoped the reason which had
â¢feeen assigned by the gentleman from Dela
ware, would be fufficient to induce the mov
er of the proposition not to press its decisi
on ; but he was surprised to hear the reasons
which had been assigned for not bringing
forward the articles of impeachment sooner.
It seemed that the gentleman supposed that
the measures which had been taken by the
house, and upon which the Seleft Commit
, tee had been appointed to aft during the re
cess of Congress, was a mere matter of form
and would come to nothing. He believed
it was a novel thing for a committee to con
travene the views of the house in their ap
pointment, and to determine the non-impor
tance of the business entrusted to them. He
believed the praftice to be as Angular, as the
doctrine was unfounded : for if it were pos
sible to impeach Mr. Blount at all, it could
be done whether he was present or not ; but
as the chairman was (hortly expefted, he
hoped the business would not at present be
proceeded with.
Mr. M'Dowell could toot agree any
farther delay. âft-vras iiot frTs 'wifii to preci
pitate-any business through the house ; but
lie thought it was high time that the arti
cles of impeachment direfted'to he reported,
were before them. Hefpoke oÂ£<the prompt
ness with which the house had a&ed at the
commencement o? this business. No feotier
he said, was Mr. Blount's letter laid before
them than he was impeached, and a com
" mittee appointed to fit during the recess,
with power to fend for persons and papers.
That committee had made a report, but no
farther step had yet been taken. What
were the motives of the committee he could
not tell; they perhaps thought they had
done their duty. It was said the chairman
would be in the house to-motrow ; if so, the
committee would have his afliftance ; if not,
they might have a member added to their
committee, if they wi(hed it. He thought
the house were bound to the country to pro
ceed with the business, and that they were
incurring censure every hour which they
neglefted it. He wished the sense of the
house to be taken upon his motion.
Mr. r. Claiborne said, the house would
â not have appointed a committee to fit du
ring the recess of Congress, if they had not
conceived the business upon which they were
employed was very important. It was to
enquire whether there were no other per
ions implicated in the charge which was
'brought against W. Blount. The house
supposed, if he were culpable, he was not
alone so, but there were more egregious
offenders than he ; and, when he gave his
consent for the committee to fit during the
Tecefs, it was with a view of their enquiring
who these persons were. The report which
had been made to the house implicated se
veral persons, as concerned with W. Blount,
a-, J he wilhed it to appear whether the (lain
which was thus thrown upon their charac
ter ought to be fixed cr removed, and as
there were persons upon the committee e
qually capable with the chaiiman ta make
the desired report, he hoped it would be
no longer delayed.
Mr. Dawfon rose to remark tlpon what
fell from his colleague (Mr. Nicholas.) â
He supposed the gentleman from Delaware
only gave it as his bpinionj or that of some
members of the committee, that Mr. Blount
could not be impeached in his abfenpe. The
fubjeft was a novel one, and he had not
fully made up his opinion upon it j but his
present impressions were, that an impeach
ment which did Hot go to affeft the life or
limbs of a man might be carried on in
fencÂ«. Hie contrary, -fre believed, was
the opinion of the chairman and of the
gentleman from Delaware, but not of the
committee.
Mr. R. Williams said, if there were no
reason to expejfitjthd chairman of the com
mittee soon, he (hould be in favor of taking
up the buiinefs at present ; but, when
they were afTured he would return in a day
or two, he thought no ill consequence could
arise from the Ihort delay. The hcufe had
decided that the impeachment (hould be
proceeded with, and he did not suppose that
the objeft of the house was to be frufti'ated
by any ineffeftual measures of the Senate
to secure the person of Mr. Blount. As
to the business being hastened from a delire
oi proceeding against any other person, he
saw no reason for this ; as the documents
i were berore the fuch a proceeding
> might as well be had now as when the ar
tides of impeachment were reported.
Mi. Nicholas moved to poftpo'ne the
decision of thisqueftion till Thursday. If
the chairman did not return in the mean
time, he supposed there would be no ob
jection to the appointment of another mem
ber in his place.
This motion was agreed to.
On motion of Mr. W. Claiborne, the
house resolved itfelfirrto a committee of the
whole on the report of a feleft committee
on the petition and remonstrance of the le
gifiature of the state of Tennessee, Mr.
Dent ifi the chair. The resolution report
ed having been read,
Mr. Macon moved to postpone the consi
deration of the resolution reported, in order
to take up the one which he had brought
forward this morning, and which had been
referred to this committee, as being more
conformable to the usual mode tdf appropri
ating to enable the President to effect any
treaty intended to be he held.
This motion occasioned a very warm, tho'
we cannot fay a very interesting debate, in
the course of which several disputes took
place on the fubjeft of "order. Indeed sev
eral members (among whom was the fpeai
er) thought the debate altogether out of
order, as they considered the lalt resolution
proposed as a substitute for the former, to
admit of which is contrary to a Handing
rule of the house. The chairman, howev
er, having declared the motion for poft
ponenici.t t<- the debate upon
it continued for about two hours, when the
question was taken and negatived 44 to 41.
I he advocates /or the soltportcment were
Meflrs. Macon, W. Claiborne, Gallatin,
Rutledge, and R. Williams ; those oppo
sed to it were MelTrs. N. Smith, Brooke*,
J. Parker, Harper, J. Williams and Thatch
er" , The committe rose and had leave to lit
again.
Mr. Clopton, from the committee of en
rolment, reported the bill for compensating
the doorkeeper of the senate and his afift
ant, and the bill for the relief of John Frank
as duly enrolled.
Mr. Bayard presented the petition of
George Reed, praying for a certificate of
registered debt in the place of a loan-office
ticket which he had loft or destroyed.
Mr. Sewall, from the committee appoin
ted to take into consideration that part of
the President's speech which relates to the
protedtion o%commerce and the defence of
the country, made a further report. The
committee dates, that further appropria
tions are neceflary for the completion of
the frigates, for an account of which they
refer to the documents from the proper de
partments which accompany their report.
Phey also Hate, that onlyitwo of the reve
nue cutters are fit to and equip
ped in the manner directed by congress, viz.
one on the Virginia station, and one in the
Delaware ; that the former only had been
armed for want of being able to procure
the neceflary cannon. The committee re
port four refolutionsfor the adoption of the
house.
The firft for the sum of
dollars for completing and equipping for
sea the three frigates.
The second for the sum of
dollars, for the pay and subsistence for the
term of one year, of the officers and crews
011 board the said frigates, and
dollars for ammunition, &c.
Ihe third, to authorize the President to
procure whenever, in his opinion, the fitu
tion of the country shall require it, not ex
ceeding vessels, fuitablc to be
employed for the proteftion of our fea
coafts, and to cause the fame to be armed
and equipped, on the fame terms as are di
rected for the naval armament, and that
there be appropriated not exceeding
dollars for the purpose.
The fourth proposes to authorize the
Prelidentjto establish, in some eligible fixa
tion, 3 Foundry, to be employed in casting
of cannon for the use of government, and
dollars be appropriated for
the purchase asa neceflary building and ma
terials, and to defray other expenccs atten
ding the eflablifhment.
The documents from the War Depart
ment accompanying this report, agree with
the estimates produced the other day, when

Philadelphia, 24 th of dugufi. 'â 
James Monroe, ambassador from the U-
I liited States near the French republic, has :
: just published his correspondence with Tim- 1
, othy Pickering, secretary of Hate. 1
James Monroe, in his letter of the 6th i
and Bth of July, demands the motives of 1
his recal, " It is not conformable to the 1
, principles of an eledtive government, to
blafl the reputation of a citizen by a dif- 1
graceful recal, without exhibiting the i
motives thereof. Let kings, fays he, give i
no other reasons for dispensing favors or <
disgrace, than their good pleasure or their
caprioe ; but let it not be thus under a re- '
publican government. ' 1
Note by the Paris Editor. i
We cannot concur in the opinion of James
Monroe, which we even regard as contrary to
every principle. A government which is*ref
ponlible must necefTarily pefiefs the right of re
calling, removing or employing those who pof
-1 fefs, or have loft, t'seir cojsfidence. Deprive it
of this right, and you leave it nothing but the
burden of responsibility without the power of
a<sf!ng. You leave it at the mercy of its agenti.
Neither a recal, moreover, nor even a removal,
reflect difnoneur, whatever Mr. JVonroe may
fay on the fubjedt, and it is only ambitious and
keadjlrong blunderers <who ever complain either
of not being employed at all, or of be ng remov
ed.

" Citizen Generali
" The prisoners of Olmutz, happy to
owe their deliverance to the good wilhes Â®f
their country in your invincible arms, have
enjoyed in their captivity the thought that
their liberty and their livss were attached to
the triumphs of the Republic, and your
personal glory. They now enjoy the hom
age which th?y love to pay tothjeir deliverer.
" It would be plea ling to us, citizen
General, to go and ofter in person this ex
predion of our sentiments; to fee in the
Theatre itfelf of such viftories the army
which had gained them, and Hero who
had placed our refurreftion in the number
of his Miracles; but you know that a jour
ney from Hamburgh isnot left to our thoife
and it is from the place in which bade a
last. adieu to our goalers, fnat addrefs
our thanks to tlisir conquerer.
â ' In the solitary retreat upon the Danih
Territory of Holftein, \4e are trying to,
re-eftabKfh the health wf thole whom you
hav? saved, we join to the wirtjes of our
patriotism for the republic, the warmed in
terest are for the illustrious General to
whom we are Itill more attached by the ser
vices which he has rendered tp the cause
of liberty and our county, than by the per
sonal obligations which it is our glory to
owe him, and which the warmed gratitude
has forever engraved on our hearts.
