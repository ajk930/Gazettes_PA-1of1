SYLVAN 14 HOSPlTitl,' c (
RESPECTFULLY SHEIVETH: Â£
That, in the beginning of the year Â»75 1 Â» vi
a p133 w43 presented to the A'.icmWy, for a
Public Hospital, for the benevolent purpose The
of receiving and accommodating the lunatics
andfich i)i)or of P<jrinfyl*amaÂ» u
This pian was approved of by the legiua- g,
ture, w.'jo ibe wed a good difpoiition to car- w
t-y it into effect, but they had some doubts
of encouraging the building, for fear that e ,
individual contributions would not be railed -j
in proportion to legislative aids. J e gi
A trial however was soon madeâthe As- mor
ftmbly gave in May following, two thouf- w( .(
and pounds, towards erefting the eallern
u ing of the Hospital, embracing at that jj en
time the idea of extending it at a future day
whenever the circum (fauces of the province w bj
(hould Tequire its enlargement: to this gift OI
they annexed a condition, that the money
should not be paid, until the contributors ne j
jhould riife by fubfci'iption an equal fuui for rfa(
the fame Â»>fe. And in a fliort time more t
subscribed than the aÂ£f required. 1 lie
institution was then organized, and twelve (
Managers, a TreaTurer and fix Physicians blic
were chosen, who freely undtrtook the fer
â¢ vice of the house, for the fake of the sick a n d wal
iuffering poor. A charter was also procur
ed, which provided that committees of the mo ,
house of Assembly should viiit the Hospital,
whenever it appeared proper to them, that
the annual accounts should be fubrriitted to f e g
the house, that the laws and rules for thee- p ol ,
leftion of managers and piiyficians should be t },e
approved by the chief Justice and attorney
"generalâand finally to shew, that every ob- jj or
jed of the contributors tended to the public '
weal, a clause was inserted, by which the con
Hospital, with all its property, was to ef- f ev(
cheat to the province, in cafe the contribu
tors should fail. Thus in the early fettle-. to ,
ment of Pennsylvania, the hospital took its w j,,
rife, the legislature became its pajron, and legi
every humane citizen, its friend. y ea
By a combination of public and private
exertions of so rpany charitably difppfed peo- <j e( j
plej in the province, the. manageis were a jj u
enabled to finifh the eastern apartments ; but n j Ql
the two thousand pounds which the affem- t ; OI
bly gave, and the iirft contributions that ] e( j,
were raised, were expended in the building! | a ft
it therefore became necessary to procure a on
reimbursement of this money to the capital ft; t|
flock; for which reason the managers peti
tioned the assembly to replace it. The noT
piayer of this petition was rÂ«adily gran'ed, ma(
by
exclusive honour of railing the firft asylum
of the kind, that was known in the state, f er ,
if not m the Union, for the most abided
aud helpless class of people, bot' in body. j; ev
and . mind. To the humarie citizens cf aic
Pennsylvania, and <Â»o many benevolent per- j nt j
sons in England, and in other parts of the r h s
world, the credit of endowing the inftituti- ;
on with funds to support it, nnqueftionably
belongs. âSuch liberality is not to be found
in the annals of this country, in which a pri
vl. association of gentlemen, who had no
personal emoluments in view, have freely
fubicribed a produftive flock of twenty
thousand five hundred and tffghty-five pounds Tf
ten (hillings and four pence, for the use of
the poor. In addition to this sum, they I
have added to the hospital estate, two valu
able lots of ground, to be kept open for ever
for the benefit of the frefh and wholesome -p)
air for the patients. To prove that the con
tributors have rendered this importantfervice
to the country, the managers can appeal to Sii
the annual account* which were rendered to
yotir predecessors in the year 1774, all of g (
which they prcfume are carefully preserved
among the archives of the (late. Br
About this time the affairs of the hofpi- Cc
tal were in a prosperous conditionâwhen a- Cs
las by events inseparable from the war which
occasioned the late revolution, the contri-
butors loft above ten thousand poundsâthis jj
(hock in the infancy of the inllitution, pa- r,
ralifed thÂ« adive operations of the managers
for several years, but as the native, benevolent L
spirit of PenÃfylvanians was yet alive to the
miseries of their fuffering fellow citizens, the
managers were encouraged to re-assume their
labors. And now when peace returned to
heal the wounds of a long war, ar.d the lap p
of industry was filled, with the profits of agri
culture and commerce, the managers fought
for new contributions, which they received
from many charitable citizens ; by these,
means the capital was partly restored, so
that in 1793, it amounted to feveateen
thousand and fixty-five pounds eleven (hil
lings and ten pence.
At this time it became indifpeafably ne
cessary to enlarge the Pennsylvania Hospital
so as to admit a greater number of lunatics
who with other patients were increased with (
the growing population of the state, and for
whom the old apartments of the house were r
inconvenient and wholly infuflicient.
To effeft this enlargement of the building
the managers submitted a new plan, nearly
refetnbling the original plan of the hospital,
with an address to the lfgiflature. They
approvd thereof, and gave ten thousand
pounds towards carrying it on, to be paid
out of the loan-office fundof the ysar 177 3.
Of this sum the managers have
received but, Â£7696-14- 1
In addition to which, on a fur
ther application the legifle
turegavein 1796, 9375- 0-0
Those monies amounting to Â£17071-14-1
are the total amount of all the ca(h receiv
ed from the legislature Hvthis time, for
the above purpose, and they are all ex
pended in carrying on the work.

1 The managers further represent to the
legislature of the state, that chiejly by the
" monies they have given them, the call and
' western apartments of the hospital are clo- ,
1 fed, and that about fifty two lunatic pa-
: tients, besides others, aie Â»ov/ accomroo-
r dated in them ; but the middle house,
; which is the proper centre of communica- Q au j
E tion with all parts of the family, is open to
r the roof, the outward walls only being car- b
9 ried up, so that the valuable work that is al-
r ready done, with many materials provided
: to carry it on, are exposed to the weather Â£ rQm
: and in danger of being destroyed. r .,,
Considering this, and that former affem
s blies have thought the institution of so
" much importance to the state, as to give to
-1 wards the whole building, at different times
* twenty-five thousand pounds of the public y (
: money, to raise it to its present condition, (
Â» the managers are unwilling to believe, that
1 the legislature will desert it in this imper-
3 feft situation, when about fix thousand
pounds will probably secure the benefits
e their predecessors iatended their conftitu
-1 ents (hould derive from the liberal contribu-
" tions they have already made. j.
c The managers therefore, in behalf of the (rQye
2 contributors, apply for fix thousand and
seventy-eight pounds, to finifh the house* Â£Ver
" And when they call your serious attention eVe |r
to the records of this ufefHl institution,
s which have been faithfully laid before the
legiflature every year, for more than forty
years past ; when they remind you that the
e numerous and various cases which are atten- â 
ded in the hospital have been the means of
e alluring students from every state irt the TJ
-1 nion, and thereby of spreading the reputa
* tion of Pennsylvania with medical knowj
1 ledge, to distant parts of the worldâand a c
> lastly, when you find (which is a truth up- ccs 1
a on record) that the contributors to this in- tu "
'' ftitution have assisted about nine thousand
" inhabitants of the state whose citizens you ru P'
; now represent, who have been affli&ed with P^ e '
'Â» madness, casualties, and almost every dif-
* ease that the mind and bodies of men 0
n and that they have been the means of pre- j;"
serving several thÂ«ufartds of the lives of re P'
thofe distressed people, they trust and be- out '
y- lieve you will not require a more powerful men

Thefo exprefliens must he admitted to be plain I
â¢nough to be underftcod by every body. 41 We to

but one meaning. If this fentiniene of the exccu

of a multitude of words, some colour or fubter- Â°-
fuge miehfc have been foand the part
which Mr. Monroe ailed when he encouraged, s ou
and even explained Â»o the committee the outlines tak
of a :planfor obtaining a large sum of money on Yo
loan from the Um't*d States to enable France to pro- all,
focute the Vnr in Europe, which he thought they fun
wete able and willing to lend. On this occasion eve
we shall find him tranlgrefling the limits of his in- ava
ftru(slicns, and pursuing the Â©bjeet tnoil dear to his a *e
heart, and never out of tÂ»>s view ; the objeÂ£i of taci- 1
ing the United States to the French republic. I am a- na *'
ware, that the mere closely Mr. Monroe shall have P^ at
(luck to thU principle, the more effectually he 1
must have recommended himfelf to the democrats,
or Jacobins, of America; yet, as I love justice, and cr(
wifti not to derogate from his merits with this def- rc
cripti6n of his fellow-citizens, I lhall not pass r e
without notice, this evidence of the slavish fplrit
which generally marks hia-ouiprofit'aMe or perm'ci- m"
ous ministry.
Relative to this fubjcd:, Mr. Monroe, on the w i7|
30th November, 1794, wrote to the secretary of t h c i
state a letter, of which the N following are extradts : mo f
"In the close of this affai^-f'Was invited by the drea

" No ather arrangement can well be made than
that of leading fn.nry to France, if in our power; "
it being undcrlW od flie will secure, at tie time of her 7 0u
c-.on peace, the complete recognition of our rights the
from Britain and Sjram, and which (he may easily ever
do, in my judgment, and without prolonging the

Alter extolling the power and fuccefi'es of Fiance, mu

I will here put a few queftlons : When Mr. Mon- IS a '
roe was told, in his inftjuilions, " that the United thor
States were unable to aid Franc* with money," by (tarn
what authority did he dtfire permiHion to put his have
ideas en paper relative to a loan of moiiey., and a- ,

Though Mr Monros had bÂ«n told in his inflrufti- 3
ons that tie United S-aics could nM aid France witn '
vd- money, here is apr jest for obtainÂ® a sum of money
ted on loan, which he communicated in wruin> to the
ing Committee', arid which he thought would be nhtain
. 6 ed, if we could be allured by Fiance that we ihould c
ea " not need our rcl'ourcet for vindicating our rights a
ter- gainst Bri am and Spain. The turn contemplated was q
llty to ur or five millions of dollars, and the plan ot Mr.
Monroe was that this sum Ihould be advanced on
loan it France would promise to fetUre to us when t
,it(hould make peÂ«ce, the navigation of the Mtifilip \
pi, the weltern polts, and would protest us againtl
our ,h Â« Algeiines In bis letter of the 2d Ijeccmber
1794, to the Secretary Â©t St?tc, he writes concerning 11
PÂ®" the loan in this manner, " I (incerely wilh we may

ing ' w jH fay no more upon this palpable difregarri
of his inftruflions, and his direst counteraftion of the Â°
pacific and neutral policy of the executive. The pro- v
jeil, if it had been carried into effeft, would have
the delivered this country bound hand and foot, into the
Ith ,rrnl of the French republic. The length and breadth
.t of it was, that we Ibould lend our money and trust
to France for protection and for obtaining justice for S
Ce, us from Britain and Spain at some future day, namely,
3,) when it Ihould make peace with those nations. Thus
in P" ce be deferred ever so long, America
, . was to continue all that time without compeefation
t) C for fpo'iatinns on our commerce, without the weft- tl
em polls, and without the navigation of the MifliHip
pi, America was also to put its resources into the
5* hands of France, and confide its mod essential inter- te
j efts, and ( might fay it* very being, to the power
I and will of the French republic.
To recommend the projefl Mr. Monroe Hated, that
we might lend the money to France to prolecute the â
| war ; and remain at peace with all the belligerent &
j nations. Is it possible that he could really entertain
| such an opinion ; or was he insidiously intending te
I diaw OS into the war on the fide of France. Surely
I amain would not bavebelield us affording to France
f I loan of money to carry on the war without resent- or
I ing a departure from neutrality so inluffeiable : and I
! if Britain should have resented it there must bavo been f_
ler i a rupture. Besides, how wrest the posts from Great

ed In his juftificator y letter of the ,2 th February nq<,

the Sabbath is so (hamefully notorious, that Nev
every well meaning inhabitant of this once failt

must be sensible that it calls for their united 1
exertions to avert the solemn judgments of Skii
an offended God, by obtaining the interfer- Bat;
ence of the legislature now in feflion, to pass on s
some law that will punilh the guilty. The prni
pafling of the stage coaches on the Sabbath,
is also a serious evil, which calls for the au- I

ay Jnpiter of 74 gans, vice-admiral fir ; ' l '.
Richard Onflow's prize, which he found at
sea in a most leaky and distressed condition ; lh
rs. so much so, indeed, that when he firft came
up with her, the officers and people on board s ol
'â 7 : proposed to take the men out, and deftjroy ,-e
rt the ship, conceiving themselves every mo
â s, merit in danger of going down. Sir Tho
rn mas, however, by persuasion and good ma
-8 nagement, and by the utmoftj exertions,
ft got them to remain on board, ercfted jury
mafts, secured her rudder, and took her i'n
t, tow. He has thin preserved a valuable ani
â d prize and trophy of viftory, as well as res
cued from imminent danger the lives of a
it great number of brave and deserving men. ' J
It was on a cruize, after his attack of the

â¢, he fell in with the Jupiterâln regardto that T>
attack, 10 honorable to his intrepidity, there

as two brigs and a fchooncr guiy boat that
were with him, and got into Gcree, at the Â° n

New-Theatre, ri<
December 11, 1797* of
i Managius particularly request the con- oE
Jl currence of the public in the abolition of a
cudorn, which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
way or disposing of RIiTURN CHECKS at the
Theatre. Tj
They are aware that gentlemen are unconfoious
of any wrong done to the interest of the inftitu
tionby this practice, from a general, though mis
taken idea that Checks are die representatives of a
right to so many feats in the Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will *,
when in fait, they were never intended as more
than taktii by which the Door-keepers aft enabled
to ascertain with the least trouble to the parties, that
tbey thcmfilvcs have been before in the Theatre, or
n paid for their admifiion.
*â¢ Independent of the injury the Managers sustain,
lt such a pradice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other difordcrly persons to surround the doors of
~ the Theatre, to the corruption of their morals and
the great annoyance of t'ne Audience.
e > It has also been the fonrce of two evils of no in
considerable magnitude; one is, that fomctimes
very improper company is by these means admit
~ ted ; and the other, that owin,- to Checks palling
into difhcmell hands, they have be;n frequenaly
counterfeited to a large amount for the purpofesof
t c Sale
j, This flatement will, it isrefpeilfully hoped, in
li ducethe Public to discourage such a traffic : and
>ll the eiertionsof the Managers will, if thus afCtled,
I- easily pÂ»ove adequate to its entire abolition.
