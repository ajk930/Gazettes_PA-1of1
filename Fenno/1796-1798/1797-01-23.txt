CONGRESS of run UNITED STATES,
HOtTSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 4, concluded,
The report of the committee of Ways and Means
on the fubjeft of the balances due from indivi
dual States to the United StaiÂ«j being under con
fidcration.
. Mr. laid, from the nature of the ob
jefiioos which had been made, h; (hould have been
as well fatisSedjf the present fubjeft had not at all
been stirred ; but having been moved, i[ ought not
to he abandoned. And thi3 flowed fro(Â« the nature
' of the ebjt'flicn offered ; bccatife, if they had a
right, they had the moral or phy/icalpower of en
forcing that light. There could be no doubt, if
the money was due, it Slight to be paid, and every
C9ltfideration of expediency pointed out thisasthe
proper tine. He knew he had heard Ihe gentlemen
from New-York, over, and over, and oyer again,
deny that tl|Â« debt was due ; but, fiippofing this
'to be the cafe, why not make the application ? If
when that application was made, any flaiettid not
chafe to pay' the money, they would ef course Kate
their ebje&ions. But he watT well fatigfie'd they '
ought not to flop at making the demand. They j
KÂ»d been told, though not in dircft dims, in faeh
as were well understood, that we might demand if
we pleased; but, under the present impreffiuns B f
New-York, they would not fÂ»j the debt said to be:
due from them. They had been told by other gen
tlemen that they had not the qjeans to coerce the !
payment. If this were rhe cafe, it was proper they
fhouM lay hands upon, the only thing in their pow
er, which, was their>fliare of the public debt of the-
UOtOlt.
By this, Mr. S.said, it would be fern, that he
meant to revive the quellion of the gentleman from
Virginia (Mr Nicholas). He w? s very indiffer

knew there was no rule of order that could prevent
an amendment being introduced in thi committee
of the whole for difcudion. He-said, if they could
get at this money, violating any principle
ol right, they ought to lay hands ou at lealt a debt
of I ,200,000 dollars, for which they were receiv
ing ititerelt ; more especially as this,was a part of
the balance found againll them in the settlement of
the accounts.
Mr. S. said he could drawns analogy between
the -prefeut business and the Britilh treaty, and
wondered any gentleman should think ofintrodu
cing that fubjedl. It might be porfe&ly true, he
said, that it would be improper for one nation to
lay hands on the property of another ; but, was
there any law to prevent him from laying hold of
his antagonist ; and if, said he, the property of
the Hate of New-York is in my hand, and (he owed
me money; where was the propriety of with
my right hand, when theie was an uncertainty of
receiving with the other ? He thought there could
be no objedlion on this ground; but there was an
objection on a(A.oiM*t of the negotiability of go
vcrnment paper. He owned he had fcrupies on
that,fubje&. The gentleman from Virginia hav
ing douhtlefs considered the fubjeÂ£t, could perhaps
remove them. In order therefore to bring the
motion before the committee, he moved to add the
following amendment.
Â«â¢ Relolvtd, that any transfer of the debt of the
United States in the books of the treasury, held
by any of the debtor states, by the settlement of
accounts between the several states and the Unfced
States, or by any person holding evidences of the
said debt, (hall be withheld, until the balauces of
the said states (hall be discharged.
Wr. Nicholas said he did not understand what
fciuple the gentleman from Pennlylv;mia could have
about the transferable property of these debts. He
was fntisfied with refpeft to New-York, and it was
iinpoffible any other corporate body or person cf>uld
be affefled by the motion. he said,
was a sale of the therefore, a denial of
transfer- would completely prevent any person from
being involved in this measure belides the state in
queftmn.
Mr. Gilbert asked the gentleman last up, if there
was ho difficulty of a constitutional kind i:i tke way
of this measure ? If he understood the cqnftitution,
they could not pass an ex post faÂ£ti> law. Had
they not alreaiy said this paper should be transfer
able ? If so, had they a right to fay it (hauld not
bÂ«transfetable ? Was this the regard which the I-e
---giflature intended ts shew toils own faith? He
trusted it was not.
Mr. Potter objected to the present motion. He
fiid the state ot was a del,tor or not.
She would either (hew berfelf not to be a debtor,
or pay. But to pass this refutation would be to
cenfider them as swindlers. If jt wasa debt, he
was confident they would pay it.
Mr. P. (aid he could not account for the manner
in which the gentlemen from New-Yprk had.mana
ged this business. In one place they fay they have
no authority to adV, and yet in the next moment
they proceed to oppose the refutation to eall tjpon
their State fur the debt, as tf they fnppofed that
unlrfs they opposed the business, their Itate would
be so simple and honeit as to pay, without objfc&i
on. Bat, for his part, until he. kne<fr whether thai
state would pay this debt, or hot, he (houffi believe
they would pay it honorably.
Mr. Williams defended the conduct of the dele
gates ftom the state of New-York.
Mr. Gallatin wiflied the mover to modify the re
foiutinn, {& that it (hould Rot aflcdt any (late to a
greater amount tlÂ«an the debt they owed. For in
stance, the balance against Pennsylvania was about
Bo,coo dollars, but (he had upwards of 400,000
in the funds, and he (hould wi(h that the pioviflon
(hould not reach to a higher sum thsti the Bc,ooo.
He laid he had, however, no fort of view to Penn
sylvania, because he believed (he would make no
obje&ion to fulfil her engagements.
An amendment to this effect was introduced,
when the queflion was put and negatived, 45 to
30.
The original resolution being under confidera
lion,
Mr. Hendeifon said, he should not have rose, but
for an observation of the gentleman from New-
York (Mr. Gilbert.) That gentleman had said,
" That he did not believe thtre was a member of
that committee who really believed the balance
found against the state of New-Yark, to be just."
Mr. H. said, if he were of this opinion he (hould
vote again It the resolution ; but believing, as he
did, that the balances were just, being fcultd by
men of. abilities and integrity, who had no iitfereft
to do OiLer .han right, and as no objection had ever
been made by any of the states against the.balan.
ces, be should think himfelf unfaithful to his con
diluents if he did not vote for it. He begged,
therefore, the gentleman would except him from
the number who did not believe the debt juti.
I Mr. Gilbert allowed the geuileroan might be an
exception.
Mr- believed the debts just, aud deftr
ed to be ane'her exception.
Mr. Potter said one gentleman from New-York
talked of the great exertions of th.it state in the
war, another came forward and said he tfcd nat'be
lievi t.'.ere was a member in thehoufe who believed
in his heart the debt was just. Every Bate in the
Union, he said, might come forward and boast
of what what they had done ; but it would serve
little purpose ; for his part, he-believed New-York
bad done the lesl}, and been benefited more than
any two states. lie wished also to be excepted
from the gentleman's account. He thought the
debt just. 6
Mr. Burgefsread feme ebfervations, which flat
ted the hardihips experiended by North-Carolifia
during tht; war; and as to the debt which she was
laid to owe, (he ceuld not pÂ«y it. Mr. B'Â» voice
was so low, that it was impossible to take s (ketch
6f his ideas.
Smith (aid he was one of those who could
WÂ»e wished the present fobjcft had not been bro't
before the hoiife ; but being before it, hÂ« was rea
dy to give his vote for the measure, as it was in
cumbent upon them to endeavor to get the balance
paid. ThÂ« gentlemen from New-YÂ«rk and North-
Carolina had complained of the ir.juft-tce'of the
vebt. The Hate which hÂ« represented, he said,
was a .debtor (late, and they were willing and able
to pay. The -gentlemen from New-York, it ap
peared, were anxious to have the whole business
opened again. Oneijf those gentlemen gave as a
for this, that (lores in the account were
charged more in one state than in another. He
saw no injury in this, as flour might be pnrchafed
in Virginia at 7 dollars a barrel, when m Pennsyl
vania it might be IÂ». This tingle objection (hew
ed-what cavilling would be the confequcnce Â»f an
opening anew of the accounts.
Mr. S. said it appeared to him that the state of
North-Carolina had less reason to complain, than
any other state in the Union. He did not mean
to fay that they exerted themselves less, and he be
lieved the exertions of New-Ysrk were not exceed
ed, according to her means, by any other state.
An observation, he faiJ, had been mads on the
fubjeft of affnmptions, by a gentleman from North
Carolina".' He meant not to hare ripped up this
bufmefs afreftl ; but since it had been mentioned,
he wuirid fay their debt had been occasioned by too
high an aflumption ; if that had not been the cafe,
they would tiave had to receive a very considerable
futn. How, he a2<ed, did New-York get poflef
fion of her treasure? By theblsod and- of
the whole* in her vacant territory. This was the
way in which (lie became rich, and it was extraor
dinary that a state which had gained so much by
-the revolution, (hwuld be avcrfe from discharging
hei just debt. How they were to get at this debt,
he knew but the,y mull pay. It was doubted
it would not be paid ; but he trusted that a ftÂ»te
famed for her order and good government, would
not refufe to pay a debt so justly due.
When the mode settlement was agteed to,
Mr. S. said, none knew wh<Â» would be debtors and
who creditors. All acqiriefced in it. Why, then,
talk about going anew into the business, which
might take them a year to fettle the principles
upon which it should be opened ?
He trusted these balances would he paid, as the
reprcfentatives of creditor dates would be very un
willing to lay a direiSt tax upon their conftitueHts
until they were discharged.
Mr. Blount observed, thet he had said so much
on a farmer occasion upon this fubjefi, and know
ing that whatever he might fay would Save no ef
fect upon the decifimi, he meant to have fatiified
himfelf with (hewing by the yeas and nays, that
he had not been cotifeHting to the measure. But
when he heard the gentleman from Maryland ( Mr.
Smith J f;:y " that North-Carolina had less reason
than any other state to complain," it would have
been criminal in him to have been filenl. He had
made the aff.<rtion without a single fa& : it could
not be ttSe. He believed the lAiited States would
not believe it. not Georgia and Sooth-Ca
rolina, Mr; B. asked, defended by North-Carolina?
Could it have been believed that Georgia was a
creditor state, when charged 0:1 the ratio of two
rrprefeotatives when entitled to less than one.
Had nor South-Carolina militia from North Caro
lina in almost every month of the war? Such an
aflertion was one, that, on reflection, the gentle
man wÂ«uld be ashamed of having made.
Mr S>, Smith defended his afTertion, which he
grounded on her debt having been very considera
bly over aflfumed.
Mr. Blount said, if they had no other grounds
of complaint, they (hould have complained of this..
If North-Carolina had had no debt assumed, he laid,
(he would have been a creditor for more than two
millions. She would have funk the debt, inftcad
ps having a debt of more than 430,000 at home,
and under a charge of owing to the United States
more than 500,000 dollars
Mr. Livinglton said it was extraordinary, that
gentlemen Pnould be continually infilling upon the
impropiietv of going into an enquiry whether the
claims in queilion were just or unjull, yet they
themielve9 went into comparisons betwixt the ser
vices o( different states. He would not make any
comparison on the ; bat he would do what
lie thotiglit neceflary, viz. tcilify to the world his
ohje&ious to the present proceedings. He had al
ready taken up so mu.h time of the committee,
whi.-h however had been moltly employed in fruit
less attempts to get the Lufinef> postponed, that he
lliuuld bt unwilling then to trespass long upon their
patience.
1 his bulinefi, he said, originated under the old
confederation. The states agreed upon an order
for the settlement t>f their debts; but in the new
conftitijtiob they entered into a new governmental
compa& for the settlement of tbele debts, so that
it was Sound to be necefTary to'take up the fubjeft.
They therefore found two laws palled. Here, he
laid, was the great evil which New-York had to
complain of. Here, every state who wilhed to set
aside the settlement, fhnuld point. The United
State*, who was a party concerned, pafled a law
appoint, \g commissioners arid prefetibing rules 10
govern the two parties, without any delegation
from the states. AH the states, be fni'd, would al
ways have an interest in throwing a burden upon
one ftaie, and the tnjuftice complained of would ap
pear, if it was (hewn that this was done. It was
not only their interest, he said, to da this, but rules
had i&lually been prescribed which were unjust to
fume ol the states. This hw, he said, was pafled.
New-York had no representative in the business who
had the power to bind her to this new settlement.
1 he accounts of that state were kept clear and te
gulat, with vouchers to eveiy charge ; but in this
law, it was allowed to the commifiioners to receive
accounts unsupported by vouchers, if they (hould
fee proper. He afesd if this were just to those who
had been scrupulously carreft ? If it were just, lie
thanked God he had never learnt or pradtifed upon
such principles of jtiflice. Another rule established
was, how the debt should be divided amungft ihe
different states. The states had prescribed rules,
under the old confederation ; but these were chang
ed by this law. It was now fettled that the rule
of apportionment should be made upon a scale of
population. How this affected New-York had been
(hewn by one of his colleagues (Mr. Williams).
From forty or fifty thousand inhabitants, which
was about their number at the conclusion of the war,
from emigration, they had then one hundicd and
thirty or hundrrd and forty tht ufantl.
asked, therefore, whither thii rule'-wc* jult I It
it was not, how could gentlemen be chained with
advocating unfounded positions, and even have a
week's delay retufed to gain information o:i the
fubjeCt. It was his opinion thef.- arguments had
weight, but perhaps, his opinion might not have
much weight with the committee.
But, setting aside this principle of apportioning
the debt, taking it -for granted, that New-Yotk
contented to the whole, ftili, he said, there were
principles even ia common law, under an award,
which thigbufinefs had been likened to, that would
enable them to attain relief under their complaints.
It was impossible, time had not beer, allowed them
to doit, tobring forward vouchers, otherwise they
(hould have proved that fuck overcharges had been
made by other states, a 4 would have convinced that
House of the propriety of setting aside this settle
ment ; but not having thele voucher*, he would fay
no mere en this head.
The rule* of settlement being changed without
their cenfent, being, ia their opinion, uiyult, it it
was in vain that to the jufticc and equi
ty of the house he woulti appeal 10 the expediency
of thep'refeat meature. The debt, he said, might
be just. He woÃld not be underltood as faying,
that the state of New-Yoik considered the debt as
unjust, but he thought (he did. Thinking it un
just, the probability was, (he would reiule to pay
it, and produce her vouchers to the woild, to tliew
that (be ought not/ ta pay it. In what fnuatiou
would the United States then be ?
The state ot New-York was not to e looked
upon as jn individual, it was a sovereign indepen
dent Hale of the Union, persuaded of the injustice
of the present claim, (lie would rclufe to pay it.
Already, laid he, you would have taken one itep,
you have said you would he paid. They had been
told, he said, by the gentleman from South-Caro
lina (Mr. W. Smith) of the advantages which
wnuhj arise to the Union by the payment of this
drbt, by the Hate of New York. He told them
of the Navy, the Forts, &c. it would build. In
deed he put him in mind of the exploits of J)on
Qwixote i for though he had not built himfeif
Wind-mills, he had ereifted himfeif many beautiful
castles in the air, which, he fam.ied, would havÂ«
their proper effect upon the house.
He hoped the reasons he adduced, if they had
not the cRcSL to reje<ft the prop<Â»litioÂ», would at
Icaft shew that the itatc of New York had ground
to be dtfTatisfied with the proccedit g,
Mr. Baldwin went over many of the atgumenu
of thelait speaker, and endeavoured to prove
unfounded. He also 'juftifkd the state of Georgi
a's bÂ«ing a creditor state, which he said was owing
to its debt having been aflumcd at 300,000, instead
of 700,000 di'llavs.
Mr. Potter alio notictd the arguments which had
fallen fiom the gentleman from New-York, infif.
tinj(> upoÂ« their iintenablenefs of the objections,
and of the juliice of the claim. -
The qaeftion was put and carried by a eoniider

January 19, 179;.
Letter to Mr. Piucknej, Minijter Plenipotentiary if
the United States to the Frtnch Republic,
[Continued from Saturday's Gazette.}
With these dispositions, the empress of RufHi
in February 1780, made public the principles on
which fl>e would maintain the commerce of her fulÂ»-
jeÂ£b. It is neceflTary here r* recite only two of
them. 1 ft., That all the effe&s belonging to fwb
jc&sof the nations at war ihould be free on beard
neutral vessels ; contraband goods excepted.
That the articles of contraband, (hould be regulat
ed by the 10th and 11th articles of her treaty Â»f
commerce with Great-Britain, extending the regu
lations of thofc articles to all the belligerent paw
ers.
To enforce the observance of t'hefe principles,
(he gave orders for eqtiiping a confiderabl.: pan of
her marinei
lii Jtily of the fame year, Denmark acceded to
the principles of ihc armed neutrality, and entered
into a convention with Ruflia, for maintaining them,
afTtiming for her rule in determining what articlet
Ihould be deemed contraband, her treaty of com
merce with Great-Britain, eoncluded the i|th of
July, 1670. In the third article of this treaty,
the description of contraband goods is 111 general
terms : " Any provisions of war, as foldieis, arms,
machines, cannon, ftiips, or other things of ng
ceflary use in war." But by a convention conclud
ed at Louden on the 4th of July 1780, between
Great-Britain and Denmark, " te explain the trea.
ty of commerce of 16 jo between the two powers,"
the articles deemed qelttiabnnd aie particularly enu
merated, and among them we fee " timber for
fhip-btiiidinj;, tar, refm, c&pper in (heels, fails,
iiemp and cordagr, and generally whatever ferret
diredly for the equipment of a veflel, unwioughl
iron ancj fir-planks excepted." It is remarkabk
that thele are the vuy atticlcÂ»_ admitted as eontra
bandin the tSt'u article of our treaty of cemmerce
with Great-Britain, and for which admiflion Mr,
Adet declares, " All.the commercial relations-be.
tween Franc# and the United States are entirely
broken.",
But it ii further to be noticed that this coiitcii
tion between Rufiia and Denmark, concluded in
the midfl of the American war, for maintaining
the principles of the armed neutrality, and tu
which oth*r European powers acceded, is explicitly
declared, in the gth article*, to have .been coit.

* Hist. armed neutrality, page 77.
f Marten's Treaties, volume *, page 103.c:,Tary, on account of new naval wars in Europe.
An 1 with the la't r view, the king of Sweden
manifelted the iitmoft {ulicitude left the war thsuld
be closed. without the intervention of the neuual
powers. He therefore was urgent -that the em
press, with all the parties to the maritime conven
tion " *should propafe to the belligerent powers
the eftablilhing of a congress, in which the differ
ent concerns both of the powers at war, and of
the neutral (tares, should be examined and termi
nated." And these concerns he afterwards men
tions to be " the pacification, and thi fettling of a
maritime code of laws objects truly impor ant,
and meriting all the solicitude manifefted on the
occafioH by the king.
But these fleps of the king Â«f Sweden serve as
additional proofs thVit the principles of the armed
neutrality were not confideieJ by the parties to the
maritime convention, as fandttoned by the exilting
law of nations. For permanently to eftabliih those
adorned principles, by introducing them into a ma
ritime code, was obvinufly the influential motive
with the king tor desiring a congress, at which
such a code might be fetded with the assent of all
the nations of Europe. But this pr'tjeft did\ not
fucL-eed : no congress was formed : the belligerent
powers made,pease at different periods, and with
that War ended the maritime convention. This na
nation has more reason tÂ« regret than our own, as
well becauft the principles in question refpeft some
very valuable portions of our xports, as because
our disposition and our policy preserving us in peace
such an extended liberty of commerce would prove
highly advantageous to ui as carriers for the pow
ers at war. T
We have seen then, that the law of nations, the
marine laws of France, her own treaties as well as
those of other nations, and even the fyftfin of the
armed neutrality, incontcltibly establish these prin
ciples, That enemies goods on board neutral ves
sels, are rightful fubjedts of capture Snd condemna
tion ; and that timber and other articles, for the
equipment of (hips, are contraband
of war: and, therefore, that the admiflion of these
principles, in the treaty between the United States
and G ,fat Britain, not being a grant to her of any
right (for 111 what feufe could we be fatd to give
what (he before pofleffed ?) furnifhes no just ground
of ofiVtiee to France. In what sense too can the
United States be (aid to have " re/used to other
" nations a right" which they and we voluntarily
md mutually agreed to renounce ? Or how are we
chargeable with " partiality in favour of England,"
because we do not take arms to compel her also to
renounce it ?
6ut Mr. Adet, (till relting on the idea that not
to compel Great Britain to renounce, ')) to grant her
a right, seems to imagine that we lhall attempt to
obviate his complaints, by faying ,l That France
â¢' having the right, by her treaty of 1778, to
Â«' enjoy all the advantagas in commerce and navi
Â«â¢ gation which the United States have granted to
Â«' England, is not injured by the ftipulaticiwg of
Â«â¢ the treaty of 1794 (with Great Britain) tela
" tive to contraband of war} as they become com
" raon tÂ» her."âBut wÂ« shall fay no (uch thing.
The 2d article to which he refers has no relation to
this fubjedt. Had vie granted any particular_/a<iw
to Great Britain, or to any other nation, in rclpedt
to commerce and navigation, we teadily admit that
by this article France would be immediately enÂ»
titled to the fame. But in regard to contraband
ot war, we have granted nothing, and. therefore, un
der that article, France can claim nothing.
Under the influence of present and temporary
interests, the very nature of the ftipulatisns be
tween France and the United States on the fubjedl
of free commerce and the limitation of contraband,
seems to be forgotten. They took for the bafts of
their treaty " the most pcrfed equality and reci
" pracity"âwould they then conspire to their
own hurt"? Would they volunurily ami mutually
stipulate for injuries ? Or for advantages ? Ceitain
ly the latter ; and both confidcred the agreement
jeciprucally advantageous which secured to each, in
its turn, the freedom of commerce provided by the
rules, that free (hips (hould make free goods,âand
that timber and naval ftorcs (hould be cxcludtd from
the lift of contraband.
Connected with this fubje6Â£ is what concerns the
article of provjjtons. Mr. Adet fays, that " iftei
Â« 4> having allured to the Englith the carriage of na
Â« val (lores, the federal government wi/bed to as
â¢Â« fnre them that of meals } ift a word, it defirtd to
u have commerce only with England. Thus it fti
â¢â¢ pulafes by the 18th article, that the American
" veTe's laden with grain, may be seized unfertile
Â« frivolous pretext, that it is extiemely difficult to
Â»' define the cases wherein provisions, and otherar
*Â» ticlc.i, which are generally excepted, could be
*â¢ classed in the lift of contraband at" war."
There are so many exttaordinaty affertionsk in
Mr. Adet's notes, those in the above paragraph ex
cite no surprise. The federal government is con
flicted' of citizens who have a comipon interest
with their fellow citizens of the Uaited Slates.
That common interest has a peculiar relation to
commeice, on the freedom and extension of which
the public revenue and the general prosperity of
our country chiefly depend. Will it then be be
lieved that the government ivi/hed this commerce
to be rejlrutne-l, particalarly the commerce in meals
which compose the molt valuable part of our ex
ports ? Especially will it be believed that the go
vernment deftred that our citizens might have com
tnerce only with England ? Let tele general ftnfe
of eur fellow-eitizens answer these charges. Eel
the great mass of our commercial brethren answer
they whose enterprize traverses every sea and ex
plores every region of the globe, to extend their
gainful tra' e ; citizens whose commercial adven
tures to France and her colonies have risen annual
ly to many millions ; adventures by which many
have haz tided their credit and their fortunes. Yet
among all eur citizens none have bee* more felici
tous to form a commercial treaty with Britain ;
pone more decided in approving that which has
been made.
For the reasoning of our own government on this
fubjed 1 beg leave to refer you to my letter of Sep
tember 12th, 1795, written by the Prefident'# di-
* liift.Arm. Neuf.p. 147â15Â®-
r eftnn to Mr. Monroe* Therein it wits attempt.
( Ed to (how the necejjity and our right of forming
that treaty with Great â¢ Britain, and I h )pe it will
appear to you that the i-onclufi >n is there fairly
draww, that even the 18th article, as it refpefts
pro-ifions would operate favourably to France.
Before the treaty with Great Britain, her crui
sers captured neutral vessels bound to France with
provisions. She afTertcd, that is certain cases, pro
visions were contraband of war; confequeutlv, that
she might lawfully capture'and confifcate fu'h pro
viiions. We opposed the principle and (he practice.
Britain infilled on her right. In this dilemma, it
was agreed, by the treaty thar whenever provitions,
becoming contraband by the law of nation , <hÂ»uld
be captured, they should be paid for witn a reafon
ahle mercantile profit. This stipulation, without
admitting the principle, by securing the American
merchants from loss in cafe of capture, would cer
tainly tend to promote rather than to difcouiage
adventures in provifiotis to France. Â»
But an this treaty hai been the fubjeft of ferioui
Complaint on the part of France, it is important to
enquire with what foundation the complaint is
made.
I might pass over the unworthy infinn'ations of
the miniftcrj that the treaty was entered into by us
iti order to ajjure advantages to the Engli/b, and to
furnifh our own government with a reply to the claims
of b ranee, and preremptory motives for refufals to
accede to them y. that the trui object of the negotiation
was incejfantly di/guifed under specious pretexts, and
csvered with the vie/ of di/Jimulation. These inlinu
ations have been indiscreetly addreffedlto the peo
ple of the United States. Tliey will gain no belief.
Lt may, however, be ufeful for you to be truly
informed on thil fuHjeft.
The PreGdent's meflage to t!Â»e Senate on the
16th of April 1794, does not dcclare (as Mr.
(Adet a flats) " that Mr. Jav was fsnt to Loo
don only to iJbtain a rcdrefs yf wrongs." The
President fays that Mr. Jay's million woulÂ«i an.
nounce to the world " A folioitude for a friendly
adjuftmerit of our complaints," and that " going
immediately from the United States, such an en
voy weuld tarry with him a full knowledge of the
existing temper and fei.Gbility of our country;
and thus be taught to vindicate our rights with fum
nefs, and to cultivate peace with sincerity." And
fliall the purfnit of either of these objeifts be de
nied to us ? What were our rÂ»mplaiuls ? The most
urgent regarded the fpolijtions on our commerce,
and the inexecution of the .article of the treaty 6f
peace refpeiting the potts. With the latter was
connected the Indian war, with which we hsd
been harrafied tot so many years ; and with the
former, the injury or rui(> of our merchants and
the ronftquent exienfive damage to agriculture.
Thefir the molt prominent objects of the
miflisn, were of course most observable, and most
talked of; ?nd without them the miflion probably
would not at that time have been contemplated.
But had wt no other " complaints?" Did not
the imprefiment of our fcamen, like the fpoliationa
on Â»ur commerce, excite an univetfal complaint?
Had we never manifeftedout unealinefi \at Great-
Britain's avoiding a commercial treaty I Was it not
even a fuhjed of complaint and u proa h ? Was
not the inducing her.to enter into fui_h .-ftteaty the
objtft of divers measures agitated u, eungtrfs ?
Had not a commercial treaty with Great-Biirain
been earneitly fought for trÂ»m the oonclufion of
the war tÂ« the time of Mr. Jay's miffiun ? Hjjw
also could, Mr. adjuitmg Lhc'primary ob

our pacific difpofiuon and more eflvÂ£hially "-cnlti
vate peace," than by forming ai rangemeÂ»t9calcu

good neighborhood and a friendly and mutually be

DELAWARE ST4TR LEGISLATURE.
IN SENATE.
[Extract from the Journal.J
Thmfday, Jan. 12, 1797.
Resolved, ,
That a refpedtfal addrefi be presented fnJm the
Senate and House of Representatives, to the Pre
sident of the United States, upon his intended re
tirement from office, and that the following form
thereof be adopted :
TO GEORGE WASHINGTON,
President of ihe United States.
Si R,
The Senate and House of Representatives of the
State of Delaware, cannot view with insensibility,
your contemplated retirement from the firft office
of your country, to the retreat of private life.
Upon such an occ.afion, to be lilent, and to with
hold the mod cordial expression of our affedion,
refpeft and veneration for your character, would be
as ungrateful ta you, as it would be difhouorable
to ourselves.
It ii in attempting therefore to do ju A ice to ear
feelingi, and to discharge a patriotic, duty, that we
prelcnt this address as a tribute of gratitude and
homage to your virtues.
More than twenty years have elapsed since you
left the Civil Council's of America, to undenake and
sustain the more difficult and perilous duties of the
chief military command. The seven yean cortflift
tha* ensued, mult have been to you a gloamy series
of fcven fufferings, except as it waÂ«. relieved
by temporary viftorirs, and the plcafing hope that
the exertions of your c*un(Vy, and the aids of hea
ven would crown your labors with fticccfs. 1
At the clufe of the important coated, we view 4
you in the command of a disciplined, affe&ionate,
and admiring army ; and from the example of o'
ther conquerors, we might have trembled for the
fate of our country in ihe apprehensions that its
I'rotefter would become its tyrant. But happily
for ihc U. State* and honorable for yourfelf and the
clnraser o f htiniirt natnre, t!:e fceliivjt of the coh
qutfror we.e loIt" in tlmfe of the patriot, and the in
! mtions of ambition were tepreffed by the tri
iimoli of virtue.
1 lie glorieus fpefilacle wasprefented to the xVprld,
"â  a popular, powerful, and fuecefsrul general at
clueving the emancipation of his country, and then
â¢resigning his command to an unarmed republicâ
voluntarily retiring from the honors and emolu
ments of office, and receiving in return the tribute,
not of pwwer, hut of gratitude.
We view you afeeorid time, in obedience to the
unanimous voice of America, relinquishing the en
joyment of your beloved retirement, ana accepting
the chief raagiltracy of your country, in order to
add character, credit and energy to its government.
Tliat character, credit, and eneigy, you have as
sisted in so fining and ffcuring to our government;
and we hope they will be preserved, as well to
perpetuate the memory of your virtues, at the hap
pirtefs Â©f your fe'lew-citizens.
We address you, fir in the name and on the be
half ot the citizens we represent. Wc know that
they ignite with us in viewing your abilities with
refpeÂ£tâ your virtMes with venerationâand your
services with gratitude ; and in soliciting from hea
ven for you, every blessing which can insure your
happiri *1 here and hereafter. v
On motion, the above address was unartimoofly
adopted, and sent to the House of {leprefentatives
tor their concurrence.
Philadelphia,
MONDAY EVENING, JANUARY Â» 3 , 179;.
A Jhort ejfay on the improvement of tutrn out landi.
One way of encouraging agriculture is te point
out the way to improve worn out lands ; which
may be done by feeding all such lauds with clover
as are left out. I have been in the praflice of cul
tivating clover more than forty, years, i planted 14
acres of India* corn on a worn out piece of land,
which produced about five bushels to the acre ; it
was then sown with oats and clover. The oats
were but a common crop for such land j the clover
on the following year was good beyond expediti
on, and which yielded a clear profit of 10!. the
acre in feed, belides the feed in the spring. This
year I received as large a crop from the adjoining
land cultivated nearly in the fame manner.
From these experiments, I conclude, that everv
acre of land left out unsown witli clover mull lofc
from il. los* to iol. frona what it would produce
if it was sown with clover. There arc two forti
of red cloverâone fort I call the native American,
the other the Englilh red clover. The native red
clover will grow double the length of the other, but
it is later in the bloom by about a month, and the
feeds o) bÂ»thare fomuch alike, as not to bediftin
guilh'd from each other. Some may fay how then
dial! we be furetoget the right fort to make a trial
âall theani'werl lhall give to this is, there iÂ» now
at Mr. Howards in Market-ilrefct, NÂ°. 95, a small
quantity to be difpoled of. 1 have 140 acres of
worn t>ut land lately town with clover ; only 5 a
cres of the native fort, but expedt to sow about 70
acres myrcofit in the spring.

COMMUNICA TION.
Tlie theme of gratitude, which the French gtvern
meat and our Jacobins hive with so much delicacy
reiterated in our ears, might luve bÂ«en parted over
with the contempt which a generous spirit forever
feels when favo.s are converted into bonds and fetters,
had not the wo.thy part/of the community sonceivtd
that what was so very often urged was really founded
in truth. It is time the deluflon (hould be removed â
it is time that the freemen of* America should knsw
the extent of f reach kintlnefs ; benaufe the draft upon
our gratitude is upon the independence of the country,
and riles and is modified prccifely as it suits the necef-
Gtits of our tvpuld-be majlers. When through their
minifttr they demand that we (hould repeal laws, re
â verfe judicial decries, and annul treaties, and to in
duce us to do this, tell us a canting story of the gra
titude we owe them, and the obligations they have
conferred so dtftnterejledlyâin justice to ourfelvss and
our posterity, and impelled by the sense of our real in
dependenae, we mufttnd will examine into this claim
upon our gratitudeâwe roust look into the account,
tÂ® fie -whether what is so insolently demanded of our
virtue, is not a pretext played upon our ignorance,
or a courtly trick offered to our fears. The lata com
munication from George Washinoton will let
the people fee!

THE caution introduced into the public prints,
warning all pcrfonf, againfl: purchasing from the
grantees of Blair M'Clenachau, any portion of the
large, real and perfonaleftates he conveyed away to
bis fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upan the fubjedt by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenaehan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confided in the fubferibers by
those creditors : a step which it would have been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitteH.
The very ftatcment of the fact therefore must dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindictive." it'originated in a desire to feoure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of his jail debts. It was fanttioned by the
advice ot council as a measure nccejfary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advertiiement has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjuftitiable conduct, not to the fub
fctibers who have merely puWilhed the truth in
terras as mild as the fact would admit, and who
mean to investigate in a high court of justice the
validity of those purchases of which Mr. M'Cle
nachan so confidently speaks.
tthf
The fubfcnbers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
eaution against purehafing of those grantees or
either of them, and ta extend the terms of it to a
ptirchafe from any other persons (if such there be)
to vÂ»fcÂ«m Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar

C H t\
MOBT delightfully situated on the north bank ofÃap
pahanoclc river, opposite the town of Frederickiburg, in
the slate of Virginia, consisting of eleven or fifteen hun
dred acres, as may bell suit the purchaler. There is on
this estate, a large and well biplt brick house, containing
nine commodious rooms, cxclufive of a spacious hall or en
try, ai feet square, two pair of Halts, suitable and conven
ient paflages, and excellent dry cellars. It is placed on a
fine hc~lthy eminence, commanding beautiful views in
everyÂ» diredlion over the towns of Frederickfburgh and
Falmouth, and an extensive cultivated country.âThe
grounds adjoining the house are neatly laid out in pleaf
urc end kitchen gardens interspersed with a variety of
fcarcc trees, a choice collection of flowors and floweruig
shrubs, and'ennched by various forts of the following
fruits, viz apples, pears, walnuts, chefnuts, cherries,peach
es, plumb?, ne<flarines, apricots, grapes, figs, rafberries,
gooseberries, ftrawbcrries, and currants; the whale admi
rably v?.ried by turfed slopes which have been formed by
great labour and expence. Bordering upan these im
provements, are several lots, m a highftate of cultivation,
and well let with red clover and orchard grass, from
which three heavy crops of hay are taken every year. Ad
jacent thereta are two large and flourifliing orchards ; one
of well chosen peach trees, the other of apple and pear
trees, fele&edfrom the beic aurferies in ihe state. Pro
perly detached from the mansion house axe extensive
roomy offices of every denomination, viz. a Kitchen and
Larier, house-keeper's room and Laundry, with a cellar
underneath for a variety of purposes, a liora-1 oufe and
lmoke house all of brick, a dairy and l'pring house oiitone.
Stables for thirty horses, an\J coaeh houses for four car
riages. âºAlso a large and well planned farm yard, v ith
barn and granary, a cow house, with separate 1 tails for
thirty-fix grown cattle; apartments for fattening veals,
muttons and lambs; extensive Iheds for sheep, and other
arrangements for stock of every description, with a lurge
and convenient receptable for provender, from which tkey
can be furnifhed without being exposed to the inclemency 1
of the weather. An overseer's house, blacksmith's Ihop,
and quarters fnfficient to accommodate in the best man
ner more than fifty labourers.
The arable lands are fÂ« advantageously divided as to af
ford aa opportunity of making a large quantity of Indian
corn annually, without bringing the field into similar cul
ture oftner tkan once in four years; cenfoauently the
lands may be improved by keeping up the incloiures during
the intermediate years, or may be ueneficially fallowed for
wheat and other grain at the option of the proprietor.
On the premiie* there is alio a merchant mill with one
pair of beftFrendh burr ftoncs, and one pair of Cologpe;
furnilhed with modem machinery, and now leafed for the
unexpired term ol four years, at 1501 per annum, and all
grain for the use of the farm, hopper free, which is near
ly 1001. more. she mill and miller'shoufe are built of
free stone, within a very small distance of navigation,nfcer
are twoor more valuable llfheries, and a well
aecuftomed ferry over the Rappahannock to the town of
Frederickfburg. The land contains inexhaustible quarries
of free i tone near to the river, is plentifully l'upplied with
remarkable fine water and poflefUs a due proportion of
meadow, which by having the command of water may
be eonfiderably increased. The road* are good, and the
neighbourhood genteel andfociable. In fait, exclusive ol
an improveablo and well condii oncd farm, the value and
emolument inseparably connected witn a mill, ferries,
fiiheries and quarries eligibly fltuated ; the profits ariing
from an ice-house inferior to none in the state, and a gar
den of four acres so abundantly stocked with vegetables
of all forts asto|be fully equal to the demand in market,
there might be detailed many other advantages, apper
taining to the fertility of these lands, which the subscriber
conceives itunacceffary to mention, being fully convinced
that when examined, it will be found to be a complete,
plcafant and healthy rcfidepce, pofi'efling beauties and
conveniences firfficientto attracft the attention of any per
son desirous of becoming a purchaser.
The motive which induces the fulifcriber te offer for
sale an estate so Angularly beautiful and advantageous, is
a desire to become an inhabitant of Alexandria, where he
can with more ease attend to his interests in the neigh
bourhood ef that city.
The purchaser may bfc accommodated with a few Saves
in families, either for plantation or domestic use. A part
of the purchafc money will be required and the balance
made easy, the debt being properly l'ecured.
