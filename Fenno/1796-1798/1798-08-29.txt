AN ORATION,
On the following queftim : " Would it be cottsis
" tent <witb policy and justice to prohibit the
" immigration of jo'eigneis into the United
" State j ?" delivered in a literary society at
Princeton.
MR. PRSSIDENT,
'1 HE people of the United States are thin
ly fcattei-ed over an iirmenfe tirritory, thev hive
vafl trails of land covered with almost impsne
tratle sorestÂ«, and even the country at present
under cultivation, efpecial'y to the South, pre
sents a gloomy and d.fcouraging profoeol. The
a: â¢ and maimfaClures which are the nerves of
government, and the chief t'onrces of national
independence have but just arisen, and their farr
tfeer p.-ogre 1 ? ard improvement are impeded for
want of capitals :o and skill to prailife
tl;Â« rn. America s short in a #3te of infancy,
a fb.te the most dangerous in which a nation can
ex ft, one most haVe to ftf-iiTen change and cal
culate; to invite aggreflioh f:*om every power
that < onfiding m its own flrengfh, is ready to
prey upon the we?knefs of c hers. America
lhould take warning from thehotrerso' a fevefk
jcars war, from tie,late hoflile aggrefiions of
foreign poi'-er, how (he this state of
debility. S.ie fbould mike every pofiible exer
tion to cerder het felf indeptndent n the politi
cal world, and tft for encou.itering up- '
on equal terms, those nations who may hereaf
t.-rchufetob her enemies, Every entourage;-.
.ment lhctild therefore be gi ven to the extraordi
nary ineins of population, to improvement;- in
agriculture, in the arts ami inanufaaures, and
to' the exfenfion ef c. mmeree Whether the
midration of ' orfigners itit > Ame.'ica has any

ate importAnt no itital tonfideratiotn in the dis
cussion of the q-iefl on before us âWould it be'
conhftr t with poltcr'y and jufli. e :Â« nrohibii the
irr.mgration of foreigners into the United States
of America ? J sppiehend that such a measure
would be incordiftent Â» t!i both found policy,
and the immediate principles of justice and hu
m nity.
It is read'ly that the population of
Amerii a will be more rapidly increased if the
immigration of foreigners We permitted,thinby
the ordinary meant abjn'e ; but, it is said, that
v iihout the ai ! of fcreigneisfhe will in less than
a century attain a corn|ietent population. Ad
mitting this calculation to be just, is it advisable
til wait tor so long a period > Is no danger to be
apprehended in the mean time from the avarice
and ambition of powerful nations ? Happily for
America, the firft period of her infancy has been
spent, u hile Europe convulfcd with wars, and
waited by internal commotions, has been con
fti.lined to employ her fl-ets and armies within
the fpbereof her own politics.
Peace will, however, soon rellere her wont- 1
cdvig r, and refllefs ambition may transfer the
field of wir to the banks of our western waters.
France has long iamented the dependency of
her rich rt-ed Ir.dia colonies upon the commerce
of thÂ« United States. She has with an avari
cious eye beheld us reaping the golden harvest
reletved for herfel.', and anxious to wrest it
from ns, (he has repeatedly fought t" procure
from Spain a province on onr Wefttrn bounda
ry. Dif'app. irtfed there, and emboldened by a
confidence of iuccefs, (he will cross the Miffif
lippi, snd a' teo.pr to efieCl by military prnwefs,
whit ihe vainly hoped to accornplifh by intrigue.
Let nsr, Mr rrelident, anticipate an event which
might meet us Unprepared ; as-d by an early fet
tlenieut of tins cxteiifive country, endeavor to
fecilrei; from the predatory incu.rlions of a fa
"vage foe, or tf e more regiiUr and alarming en
croachment* of a civilized enemy.
The Souihern are particularly miertft
eJ in encoui aging the immigration of foreigner,, 1
Ivlot on'y in the extent of their territory wholly
difproporti nate toi their narrow population, but 1
unfcrturiatelv, a large part of that population !

a gsneral manurniffion, by tne fatal experience 1
of e .-neighboring country, they view with infi- !
Â«ite c. ncern the continual increafrof an evil al
ready grow ir to an alarming height ; and thev '
consider rspid acc\ffion of white inhabitant's '
by migrations from abroad, its only remedy. '
Bv augmenling the ratio of freemen to (laves, (
tht-y cah effectually preserve their internal tran- c
quality Bec i; the ordinary course ofppopul- r
ti on, the negrqes, whole condition has been r
within late years considerably ame ! iora'ed, mul- a
tiply even more rap dty than the whites : and j
were rhe Jrcefs of foreigners cut off, the people <j
of the South might, at some future period, be r
compelled like the Lacedemonians, either to c
Cubniit to be m:(Tacred themselves, or to murder ;
in cool blood their miserable (laves. c
Every wife ft.-ite would direCl its operations a
with a view to increase the number of itsinhab- e
itants. To effeCl this important objed, agricul- |j
ture is encouraged, the artÂ» are promoted, and t j
commerce is extended. I,Â» (ho'rt, the multipli
cation of its members together with their per- c;
fc&ion, is the sole objeCV of civil society ; and,
lurely, so important a of attaining this h
end, oue which has ever been, and still continues d
to be, so highly advantageous to the United ; f
States, (bonld not be negleCled.
It i 6 not, however, in the effeCl of foreign a ,
immigration upon the populationof the country, t ]
that 1 view its only benefit. The improvement
it introduces in our agriculture, are of equal, if t \
not greater, importance to the wealth and pow- pl
er of the United States. Onr emigrants, Mr
Prelident, are from old countries. In every
country which has been long fettled, the popu
lation of which has become as extetifive as its
means of fubliftence will prrmit, we find habits
of induflry aud oeconomv-pervading the differ- (]
erit c'afes of the community. The pain of want
and the disgrace of poverty, here operate as
powerful motives to exertion ; and aniidft the
fcarftme/s of fubfiftunce, t! e difpofiiion to parsi
mony is early formed. Inured to labor, the.in
habitants of such a liate poflefs the power of ic
quiring property j and having often felt the
want of it, they can justly appreciate its value.
When, impelled by a deiire to improve their
condition, or flying from famine or oppression,
they leave their native cpuntry, they carry with
thein their habits and manners controlled in *
eariy life ; but they often meet with men whole
character is wholly different from theirown.
In new countries, luch, particularly, %s have ti
been favored by nature in their climate and foil ? 0 j
meH are accustomed to procure fublillenee with
but little exertion. The motives to induilry are
kere to* weak, and habrts of idleness are quick
ly ated among the pecple- Having never ; w
endured the pain of want, and fur rounded by > a
: enty, they soon lose the manners of weir :n
---. ccit.j. s yftUÂ» l< ad.da'Ugihted fn activity.
We need onlyrurn to these countries to fee the
- cffeCl of tlie;r manners upon agriculture. In
the one country we behold a garden. The hand
of BrceiTity here direCb the genius of the farm
er to nnmeriUs inventions calculated to improve
J. or abrid.'e tile operations of labor Every me
thod of fertilizing the foil is discovered. The
implements <if htilbandry are all made perfeCl,
Numerous machines are coiiftru&e 1, to prepare
the produce of the earth formarket. Every un
necfliry expenditure' is cut off; every article that
w Can be applied to an ufefnl purpose is carefully
n. preferred. liiduftry and ceconomy continually 1
e- augment the private capital of the farmer : his
to ltock destined for the employment of produCUve
labor ; for improving the lands, and augment
ing he revenue of.the (late.
: s . In the other contrry,what a ce'.itraft is prefer.t
fa to our vi&iy'? -'Agriculture feetns here intended
'd fÂ° not to improve or adorn the territory.
' The eye dwells wi;h more pleasure on the forefts,
than on the fields. In the facility with whicU the
ordinary wants of human nature can be supplied,
the planter is negligent both in acquiring rtnd accu
-1 inu!,jtiii% wealth Oe firjl leads htm to iJlenefs in
'e cultivating t!ie earth ; the latter, to prodigality,
e- fometimcs called bpfpitality, in confummg its'fruns
it i'offcfffd of large traits of lar.d, he imag
:- ines thitthe greaterthe space over which he spreads
le a certain quantity'of labour, the preater will be
jf its. product. In pursuance of this favouiite idea,
i| the Cored is made every year to groan beneath the !
I-. axe of the labourer. A ruinous cultivation soon
)r impoverilhes the cleared lands, and it will yield no
e more to the little labour bellowed upon it. More
land is open d; this is as quickly deserted as the
n former The planter now removes to another dif
i .. triif ; he traycrfes the desolate fieljU that surround
r him. and recommence* hisfydemlnvack. The
0 whole country ik at length i.kpoveriihcd; and, com-
pellcd to emigrate to remote sorest;, he robs the
* favagu of his aifcKjigbr, and converts his hunting
f witi-h into barten plains. Should the planter
' remain ftationiry after having exhaulled hiÂ» land,
't is Hecaufe; reliditig in the neighbourhood of fonie
lraall village, he has involved himfelt in debt, and
ai.. is too poor to remove. At his death,he leaves
hh offspring <6 Ihare a patrimony, which, with its
- vOtiqmlirancetj reduces them to; begging.
In the interim, the industrious pvex, who have
- emigratedfromatroad.havingamaffed a small sum,
1 thewagisol a fttir years labour, purcliafe the wÂ«rn
i out land. Educated under hardships and fatigue,
; t<iey are not difcoufaged by the wretched paofpeCt
f before tnera. They reduce to r.raCtice tlje fyltem
t of agriculture to which thsy had been accudomed
. at horn;, rhey extend their labour ojer no more
, !anr..than their expedience tells them they can
, thoroughly till, and prefervc perpetually fertile.
. They acquire riches, and render them permanent
by their application. Satisfied with a fmaU but
commodious dwelling, the greatest part of their
annual income is employed in erecting (belters for
their labouring cattle, and store houf s for the
. prcfervati6n Â®f their jjrain. They generate habits
of indudry in those around them, by teaching them
a new and mere profitable system or agriculture.
Their example spreads ; their implement! of hus
bandry, their valuable machines are copied. The
country assumes another afpedt : ft is cioathtd
with constant verdure, and crowned with rich
o chards binding to th; earth. Its mains of lub
fiffence infinitely multiplied, extend its population
augment its-Wealth and power.
These oJ-fervations, applying more particularly
to the southern part of the United States, are con
firmed by appearances every where. Let me alk
Mr. P. in what (late does -agriculture flourifh
more? in Pennsylvania : and yet, Pennsylvania is
among the latest fettled dates. She, however, by a
toleration of all religious tenets, and by other wife
regulations, has encouraged the emigration"of fo
reigners, and we have accordingly, seen her in lit- â 
tie mere than a Angle century, outstrip her filler
dates in population, in agriculture, and, in fine, in
every art, that minillers to the wants, or fumifhes 1
(he conver.iei.ces of life. And wh-re do we find 1
the bed cultivated country in the southern dates ?
Whe-e do we ind either foreigners or emigrants |
from the north who have been themselves taught
Ly forsigners ? 1
The immigration of foreigners into America has a '
no left beneficial influence over the arts in general. '
The importance of manufacturing arts to &very <
date, whether feparattd from other [late*, or con- j
n idled with them in a political focicty, cannot be /
queftioiied. In an agricultural country,, without
manufactures, thefurplus produce of the foil, hav- '
ing no home demaad to Ijpply. mud be exported J
to a foreign market ; and the people are dependent :
upon foreign nations for the ornaments and conve- ]
nienccs of life. Hence, in a time of war, unless the
date be possessed of a navy adequate to the protect
ion of its commerce,-it will not Ox ybe dellitute I
of the comforts ef life, but it will be also unable to 1
dispose of those commodities from which its revenue J
is derived. The mors bulky articlet arc, besides, un- V
fit for exportation during a J>ate vf -war, and the de
mand for them both in peace and -war, particularly f
for that part of th.m which confids of the ntceffa- "
ries of life, is uncertain, virying with the chaugej h
of the fejfons, and the progreft of devadations in c
other countries. In the ordinary course of seasons, (â 
the produce of the earth in every country, if not '
deftroytd by itÂ«enemies,is adequate to thefupport 0
of its inhabitants. To procure the greated certain 0
revenue, a nation (hould, therefore, promote the a
progress of the arts. Its own artists will, then, lj
afford a cenftant market to the farmer for his a ,
surplus produce : and add the value of that pro
duce, and of theirown labor to that of the rude
materials manufactured for home or foreign .
confuanption But, although, it is admilted, li
that the arts are of the greatest importance to a e '
country, I all be told, that in America,"the w
â¢wages if labor are so high as to prevent their y
eltablilhment. I would alk how is the price of D j
lahor to bs lowered ? or, supposing it to cÂ«n
tir.ue at its present rate, how is the evil com W
plained of to be remedied .' The value of labor P 1
cannot certainly be lowered by diminifliing the lo
quantity of it brought to market. Where the ti;
high price of a commodity is occasioned by the dt
demand existing for it, the only way of redtic- tt
ing it; is to increafg the quintity offered for i
sale ; ihis method of lowering the price of any ,
article, will always prove effeflual. As far, '
therefore, as the emigration of foreigners into
America augments the quantify c,f labor in the e>
American market, so far does it promote the td
practice of the arts by reducing the wages of the as
laborers employed in them

. ought also to observe that the inflrudtions of
, otir government and its well known wishes 1
: as well as those of our fellow citizens at
1 large, marked out and prescribed in plain <
1 and legible charadters the line of conduit 1
which has been pursued. The objefts of s

pride and with pleasure the spirit of my felt
low citizens and of freemen in the fcntimcnt d
that the fafety, the honor and the indepen- si
dence of America would have been co> >mit- p
ted by the purchase of a temporary and dc- t
lufivc peaceââa peace which purchased 1
by the abatement of i.s national charader I
and sovereignty, could oaly have served to c
expose the wÂ«aknefs of its government a d g
to invite a repetition of injuries. Nation ii
after nation has evinced the jtitnefs of dm 11
sentiment. Nation afier nation has fallen c
the victim of its credulity and mifplaeed con- si
fidence iu the efficacy of submission. Hap- si
py indeed will be the lot of America, it, c
taught by the experience of others, she u
opens her eyes on the approaching danger, t
uses all her means \o repel it, and thus pre- f
serves that liberty which is banished from so t
great a portion ef the earth. Since peace t
was unattainable, I think with you -entle- si
men, that wisdom and duty enjoin a prepa
ration for that W'-r which our government t
ha< fought in vain to avert by all those means v
vinich an independent nation can permit it- t
f'lf to use, and I rejoice to believe that ray b
fellow citizens behold those preparations ti
with firmnefs, and that confiding in the n
justness of their cause they fe.l no apprc- b

A falfe Itatement of the fracas at the old <
Coffee-Houfe, on Wednesday evening, hav- t
ing been made by the Irilli renegado in the '
1 ime Piece of this morning, it may be fa- f
tisfa<3ory to receive a correct one, which we Â«
here present the public. t
The Time Piece of Tuesday lalt, having f
-as usual abused one of our citizens, a Mr :
M'DougaJ, he called at the office 011 Thurf- <
day morning for the purpose of difcoven'ag <
and pu.iifhiug the author. The foreman â 
of the pre Is, whose name we have not ob- 1
tained, denied Burke, and indeed said he *
had not beeu there for some time, but had i
sent luch piece? as he wiftied should be pub- c
lilhed. After foiae altercation on the sub- a
jedt of Mr. M'Daugal's errand, this fellow c
told him he ui.itng Co.be considered as t
Mi. Burke him/elt, and to a .fwer for what- a
ever had:apj*aved -at th- press, and that he n
would meet him at any place he wuuTd name, a
accompanied by one friend each, and give t
hiÂ« fatisfadtion. The Oid Coffee-Houfe a
was agreed upon as the place, and that they o
should meet at 8 o'clock the fame evening, a
Mr. M'D.ihgal with'his pretended friend I
Mr. L<?af, went at th - time appointed, and n
thue met his antagouilt with his friend, li
After a few words M'Dougal flruck bimj c
but before a fv coud of time could pass, tfie g
door bu-ft iâ by a gang confiding of V
lixty people, who had affemfcled for the I
pose and lay under th.- houses in a Heigh- a
bor.ng ttrret, and at the giving of the watch a:
word " UP" had all rulhcd forwardâ t;
Every tning wai inltamly in confiifion, the tl
candles blown out, and as many as could ti
get at him, fell upon Mr. M Dangal, with g
intent it is imagined to dellroy him, but the -
notfe having awakehed the attention of the
citizei.s, u .Vlr. Knox, with Mr. Eevv and a
few others rushed in, and difcovtre'd such T
feats of prowess, as very soon todilpcrfe the
cowardly ralcals, who jumped out of the w
windows and doots Â«itli greater precipita
tion than they had entered, and it being
ftoa rumoured that the watch were at hand,
the word " UP" was again given, and in y'
two n.inutes not a man of t lie in was to be
fccn. -
Enquiry was fet on foot to iden
tify the names and perforis of some of the ]
villains, but in vain ; the mi that could ' s
then be coKedtcd was, that they appeared to \
be a band of Irilli, and that' they called
themfelvcs occasionally " The United Irish- "
men," and that this scandalous affair bad
be n set on foot anddirefteU principally by
a certain idle mechanic, who ktep.s a Jliop ~
in Maiden laneâl hardy know how to
describe himâhe is tail, fl.m, fmock-factd,
eunuth looking g ntleman ; goes rather
jlmmily dressed, but with his i.oltrils much
pljgged with fuuffâlt will be ufelefg, how.
f ever, for any person of curiosity to go to
his (hop to look at him, for it is ten chances
to one if they would firfd him there, if they
could discover the hole where the envenom.
0 ed Irish spider has retreated from the light
s and spins his daily web of (lander for the
[, Tim? Piece, there they might poiSbly find'
t !iimâBut to resume the thread of my story:
this young man is the fame one alluded to
s in the "I'ime Piece of this morning, as hav
s ing assured Mr. M'Dougal, " that he (hould
- be met at any place with one friend for the
1 purpofj: of receiving fatisfatfcion"âhe had
r gone into Wilkie's porter house over against
the scene or aiftion, under pretence of play
s ing a game of draughts, but he kept such
i a nettling about, and running .o the door,
; himfelf always attitude of
liltenin ) as to excite the suspicions of eve
i ry one in the room, and at the firft found
I j of the word " UP," he left Jiis game and
i flew aerofs the way to countenance the mob
1 | âso much has been already discovered,
but we hope meafurea will be taken to drag
ihefe people to detediun and to puniflw
ment.
Having fold this, we assert in general
t< rins that such of the (fory in the
Time Piece as differs materially from this
ftai,exsnt is a fclutely fjife ; it might how.
ever be a wait of juflice .to Mr. vf'Dougal
not >o fay that the ac hint of his (Inking
the Irifliman at thv office is a Joy,fright lie
,iid worthy the author.
After the (tory is concl'i-led bv Burk he
fays, " Twenty-five Irish gerftlcmen have
l.fc their names at (his office to aftcomroo
date Citizen Putty or his friends. The
number be made up to 900 if ll^'ceff^ily.' ,
Now let rfie appeal to the citizens of New-
York, let me a(k our " Young Men" they
will tamely bear to be infuiteri and challen
ged in a public paper by 900 United Irish
men' Whoever has rea l the late accounts
of their canfpiracles tobu n and destroy the

It will appear how well the government
of France calculated on their " diplomatic
(lull, and the zeal of their partizans to pa
ralize the measures of our government, by
the following extrafl of a letter tram a gen
tleman in the north part of this country.
" August 17th, 1798."
" Yesterday, several of us who had re
ceived a previous invitation, went to Pow
nal in order to /hew onraefpect to his Ex
cellency, the Governor of Vermont, whe*
we heard, had presented a certain company
with a standard, and was to bÂ» entertained
on the occasion.
Whilst at dinner, informa ion was receiv
ed that a reserve of Jacobins who had been
left beMcd. were busy in erefting a LIBER
TY-POLE 10 grace his Excellency's march
back to Bcnnmgton. I (hould have added
that the Bennington and Shaft/bury Jacobins
anectc'd to come oh two hours before the
Governor, unwilling to honor his procession
with their presence ; but tliey accompanied
him back, to witness the degrading and un
precedented insult which was intended him.
I h?.d a few frk*Â£l friends, about 45 in all,
and offered perfunally to his Excellency to
march before him, cut down the pole and
clear the way ; but his prudence would not
fuller him to authorize us. However promt
edby curiosity, I wext up as far as C/arle'i
tavern, where the Pole was erefted. We
saw from a diflance that it was jruarded by
a parly who seemed to be brined. I pro
ceeded with a friend in my carriage, saw the
Governor again, who was then within ten
rods of the fhatnefu< cnfign of sedition, and
I warmly alked him if he would submit to
ride by it. He checked me, and I 'thought
>t my duty to submit. The Jacobnical
crew went on triumphantly, and I turned
about with a heavy heart and a full charge
of indignartor., which had not been lessened
by the repeated iufults offered to my cock
ade. After I had rode two mile 3 bacii, I
met capta.n Gardener, captain Ellfworth
and seven or eight more; they alked me if
the Governor had rode by the Pole ? I
answered in the affirmative. One of them
observed he hoped it would not take nor,
although planted in such favourable foil.
gave a hint how to prevent it, and fix and
mylelf in a moment pledged their honor and
life to each other. I gave , y carriage iu
charge to a friend, jumped behind a dra
goon an d borrowed one'of their swords.
We went to thclpot, placed five ceniuries;
I had a poll within C v yards of the pole
and covered Ellfworth. who handled the
axe. About twenty fellows rallied from the
tavern and came to oppose us, but we kept
them off with our s words, and the pole Im

POSTSCRIPT.
Late last night arrived (hip Jane, Gardner,
67 days from Greenock. By her we ri
have received papers to June 16, which w
contain London dates to the 13th, 4 \a
days later than any heretofore received ; 9
from which we Teleft the following : tl
LONDON, June 11. F
The Dutch papers received on Saturday tV
contain the following article received from w
Parisâ" The seamen at Toulon evinced so re
much reluctance to go on shipboard, that, Ct
to obtain a fufficient number of them, do- S
miciliary vifitswerfe found indispensable. The p;
soldiers, on the other hand, feemei?? as the o!
phrase runs, as if they were going to a wed- ir
ding."
Twelve Spanish ships of the line, and 6
frigates, it is fai4Â» are intended to join the w
Toulon fleet from Carthegena and Barcelo- ii
na, which, with the transports, amount to ft
300 fail ; there are alio three advice boats, d
four bombs and 6 gun-boats.
The party of the mountain, or the terro 5
rills have acquired so powerful an afcendan. It
cy in France, that the directory have been f;
compelled to admit those recently tlcfted to b
live councils. To counterafl,however, their tl
influence and desperate machinations, the j si
direÂ£tory have liberated all those numerous ; ti
royrdifts who had heen confined immediate- i J
]y preceding,and fiibfequent to the eleÂ£lions. \
All accounts ag-ce in the increased prof- g
peÂ£l of a political convulsion being oa the t
eve of taking place. a
The following battalions aw ordered for t
Ittland :
The firft battalion of the second regi- (
ment from the tower ; the firft battalion of v
the 3d regiitient from Portland barracks; v
and the third battalion of the firft regimect o
doing duty at Wincliefter. *'
The whole confiding of 24 companies, v
Bfo met) ib each company, amounting to
1920 rank and file. a
Gen. Stanwix has the command of the li
troops on. this expedition. d
All the men of war at Spithead, ready a
for sea, have received orders to fail on the
fho'teil notice, after the embarkation !)f a
these troops. r
The letters jby the Lilbon jnail f
state the very unexpefted return there ps J
rear admiral Nelson, who was supposed to i
have gone up the Mediterranean. He re- 1
joined the fleet with all the ships that had f
been placed under hia command, after hav- r
ing victualled and well stored them at O'b- f
raltar. On the fame day the Alcmene frigate c
brought in a valuable Spanilh frigate from ]
Buenos Ayres. 1
Intelligence was received in town on Sa- i
turday that Sir Roger Curtis had joined 1
Earl St. Vincent with five fail of the line. 1
It is generally understood here, that Lord <
St. Vincent will fail with his whole force to
meet the Toulon fleet: leaving the Spaniards 1
to their own option of putting to sea or not. ]
June 13. i
If credit be given to a letter from I
Malta, a revolution has been effedted in thai'
Island. It is believed in Italy, that this is
one of the objedts of the expedition from 1
Toulon. . The property at Rome belonging 1
to the island of Mal'a, has been already
confifcated for the benefit of the French
republic.
A vefTel has arrived at Yarmouth, whieh
was taken bv the North Sea fleet, and sup
posed to be bound for Ireland, as it had oil
board a great number < >f pikes, with arms,
cloathing, kz. Another vessel with 20,000
Hand of a- ms, intended for the rebels, has
been captured by one ofadmiral Kingfmill s
fqnadron ; and one, wtth 12,000 Hand of
arms, is nlfo reported to have been captu
red by Lord Hugh Seymour. (Star, j
Pilots have left this country, for the pur
pose of conducting the Ruffian fl.et into
our seas. It is not certain what station it is
to take ; but there is every disposition in
that court heartily to co-operate in the plans
of our cabinet. This fleet, which is said
to confi.lt-of icq fail of the line and five or
fix frigates is expeCted very soon.
GLASGOW, June 16.
Paris Paper's till-tfee 9th inft. were receiv
ed on Wednesday. They contain no news
of any confequepce. The destination ot
the Toulon fleet is ftili unknown.
DUBLIN, June 7.
Sir Edward Crofbie. Bart, was tried at
Carlow yesterday, found guilty, hanged,
his bead taken off, and put on the top ot
the gaol with a few of his friends.
Sir Edward Crofbie, Bart, was the head
of a very anrient family, but of an impan
ed fortune, and we are informed, enjoyed
for a long timepaft apenfionfi|pm the crown.
He had been called to the Irilh bar, at
which he praftifed for a (hort time, and had
diftinguiJhed himfelf by tffe zeal which he
displayed iti promoting the formation of the
volunteer corps wh ch associated in Ireland
before the conclusion of the last war. He
was the confidential friend of Hamilton
Rowan, Coun. Tone, and Napper Tandy.

FROM THE ril'llty '
By the (hip June, Captain Gardiner, ar
rived lad night fnm Grenuck in 67 days,
we have received files of G1 ifgoiv and Edin- am
Uirgh papers to'the 18 of June, inclusive, "
9 days Jattr than anv European intelligence. det,
that fias been publiflied ia this country. cre
From their late dates we expe&ed to fee art
their contents of greater importance than
we firid them upon examination. They were
received last evening at a. late hour. We g u
cannot, therefor, give more ihati a brief
Summary for this morning's Diary. .Our ,
paper tomorrow will ample details "
of every thing in them that may be judged
interfiling or important. "
The most prominent articles are thofc " a '
which refpeÂ£t the affairs of Ireland. The Â®Â°
iufurgents and the king's troops have had
several engagements, two of them especially jy|'
desperate, in which the latter have been uni-
formly viftorious. At New R n fs, on the
sth June, the rebels were defetted with the j
loss of upwards of 2000 (some accounts
fa) 5000) killed, and a conlid?rab!e num-
bcr of wounded, who were carried off by
their party. On the 7th they ware driven
from Antrim (of which place tbey had just Â£â 
taken pofltffion) with great flaughtirr, by
Major General Nugent. j.
In the aflion of New Rofs the infur- j
gents were said to be 10.000 strong, the
troops only 1400. The battle commenced
at 4 o'clock in the morning, and did not an
i terminate until 5 in the evening.
| On the 12th an exprefi was received from
Gen. Nugent, Bating that D&nagh.adee
was in polLfiion of the Rebels, vfhere they
were in great force ; and that in the north
of Ireland, from jColerain to Larne, tlicy
were assembled in the b-*ft manner they
were capable of. Â«
In the French Council of Five Hundred
a proposal to open a new credit for 20 rail
lions of livres , nearly 900,000 (lerling) for
defraying the expenses of the expedition
against England has been adopted.
The Bien Inforrne, contains a detailed
account of the steps which the French Mi
nister of Foreign Affairs has taken to juftify
himfelf from the imputations which the
publication of the documents relative to W
American Negociations at Paris had thrown
upon him. This interelliog account con
fijtjs.of a correspondence between Talley
rand Perigord and Mr. Gerry, on the
fnbjett of the publication, aqd the mystical
characters alluded to in it, under the titles of j
W. A. Y. and Z. This correspondence j .
is preceded by a laboured defence of the
Â«ondu& of the French Government with j
refpeft to America, and an endeavour to
refute the charges which the American do- , p
euments contain. . j j.
The Emperor of Germany is arming ;he '
has declared he cannot agree to the.last pro-
pofals of the French Ministers at Raftadt ;
and the king of Pruflia has also declared that â¢Â»
-. they are inadmiflible. ' q
The Marquis Cronwallis is appointed Lord ,
Lieutenant of Ireland, with full powers to !
coerce or conciliate at'circumttances may
require. _ - j
General Buonaparte is off Corsica.
Accounts received in London state that
France is apparently on the eve of political
convulfnn. <

MR. FENNO,
At a time, when many diilrefied inhabi
tants arc flying from' tiie city, to avoid the t k c
prevailing fever, it ill becomes tfieiiJ-coun- 1 V ai!
trymen to tufa ihetn u.ikiudnefs, much 1 npp
lei s. is it becoming to practise impufitions *
upon them. . ptr
I am led to this reflexion by receiving a ' a
letter from my coiWpqn lent to th? south- â-
waul, who writes me, that the tavern keeper
at Baltimore was so surly, there was no a Ik
ing him to do any thing.âGood reason,
may exilt, to refufe admittance into Balti- t ., r
more to a person infefted, or fuppefed to wil
be infeded with a malignant fever, but nol pat
good reason can be aligned, for lan unfriend
ly behaviour to strangers, who conduct with
decency and pay seven Ihillings. and fix pence
for a dinner, four Ihillings and fix pence for tha
a breakfalt, and fix shillings and eight pence Sui
for a fuppcr.
AN OBSERVED.
To Mr. ââ, Philadelphia, Aug. 26, '9B.
This day I received your load of lime, r l
by your lad, aged about fifteen years, and
paid him'for it, âhe called it twenty eight ed
bulhtls ; âas we sometimes measure wood, j ol
and weigh bread in Philadelphia,' I thought th
I might, for once, without giving offtnef,
measure your lime ; accordingly I proposed _
to your boy to do itâhe did not like my
proposal very well, biit was forced to sub
mit, as the pile did not look like over-mea
sureârather than do it, he offered to a w
two bnfhels, but I c uld not agree to that,
as it was not a lair way, to take any of your
lime for nothing, so at it we went, and
every time we filled we alked the boy, if
there was too much, and when he said there
was, we (truck off til! he was latisliid, and
the whole was meafuied.
The quantity, bv ftriÂ£t measure, was 1
nineteen bulhelsand a half, and I paid liiin q
for twenty one. and a halt, luppofing that (;
I one bushel might fly off or waite in the road. A
Thf, boy (tared, ar.d 1 believe vvt) 0
to fee us Measure his lime, and we ail (tared
and wondered too ; not lets than fix or leven
of us that were present. We parted how
ever without many words and the only ob- ( -
jaition he made was that we meaiured by a
half bulhel, I did not mind that much, nor j,
did I, as I intended to write to you on the
fubjeit, regard him much when he fai<l he
would tell his DADDY- (
P. S. VÂ«u will excuse my not mentioning .
your name in the news paper at length. :
To Mr- , Aug. 27- 1
S A word to you if you plcafe, I bought r
and meafufed your load of lime.lo day, ypu
told me it contained forty five J)uft.els
you mcafured if fajrly yourfelf and found it
'" only thirty seven bulhels and a half, which
â¢ I called thirty eight bulhels, supposing it
waded half a bulhel, you "were, â 
content, and promised to tell the ftoneburn
er. From the cheerfulnefs you observed, in (
e meafuriug your lime, and the fatisfaft on
le you expreffcd, lam inclined to believe the â¢
difference was owing to an error, which I
II hope you will-avoid next time. Do bring
me another loati if you pkafe and with it
the lime burner's bill, mentioning the quan
tity, as the millers do with.flour.
