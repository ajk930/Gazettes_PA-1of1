SIR, ' J W
You appear to derive J j m
to the ajfertions you so confidently make as/J t j,
to the importation of the infiilion in the I thi
wearing apparel and bedding of the Arethu- I
fa's crew ; by repeating another ajfertioi, I f r ,
that it was impofiiblefor the stench emitted I f r(
from the snow to cause the disease, as there I a ]
is bo instance of diseases arising from vegeta- 1 an
ble putrefaftion, becoming contagious.â j
Not being a medical mah, I will not pre- j t0
tend toaffert with equal confidence thecon- I 0 f
trary ; all that I can fay is, that some of j
those who have been your preceptors in medicine I ] a
entertain the very opinion you opposeâl mud Is a
refer the enquiring reader to Dr. Cleghorn, I t h
Dr. Clarke, and many other refpe&able au- I ; t
thorities in medicine, who I am informed I th
are frequently quoted ia support of the o- I ix
pinion, that fevers arising from animal effluvia I 5
and vegetable putrefaction, are equally conta- I f e
gious. In a point, about which the faculty I w
are divided, modefly ought certainly to have I c;
taught a young author, to use less harih ex- I m
preffionj than those you have applied te the I
phyfieians who are opposed to your opinion. I q,
Thus \o fay, " they betray the most un- 4,
pardonable remiffnefs in their rcfearches into I (1
the nature ind hiflory of diseases ; or wilfully I ci
Jhut their eyes against evidence that would ft
| enforce conviction in every mind not actuated by 1 â
' i some malignant motive ; that they are vnac- j tl
i quainted with medical hi/lory, and unqualified o
to discern the connection between cause and ef- I f (
feÃ" ; is a stile of language illy suited to I y
the chara<Sler ofc calm rcafoner ; vinwar- ti
ranted by* the common rules of politeness, f;
and the praftie'e of the HiGfiEST autho- tl
â  RtTiEs in medicine: for we fee by the g
extraft given from the works of the great p
Cullen, in one of your letters to mÂ«'; he /,
fays, very modeflly, "It has new been ren- I
dcredprobable," &c. Your attempt to cram â
down your opinion, by thus fti'gmatifing eve- b
ry one who does not agree with you, de- g
feats your intention ; for notwithftabding e
your indelicate exprefllons, physicians and f
i others who think for themselves, will still t!
' retain their own sentiments. \
In my address ta -Dr. Mease, I did not 1 t
consider it of as much confeqÂ»ience to deter-1 f
mine whether the stench from the snow Nav- i
igation proceeded from animal or vegetable i
putrefaftion on board, as to afcfirtaiu that it I t
was the unhappy cause of the malignant set
ver that appeared among those firft exposed t
to it ; yet I then believed and am now ful- I t
ly convinced that this stench proceeded from \j
vegetable putrefaftion alone, having seen a IJ
lift of the cargo confiding, besides other I '
merchandize, of a great variety of vegetable 1
substances, some of them said to be shipped ;
in bad order, and after being on board more I t
than four months in a very tight vessel, oc- I l
cafioncd an intolerable stench whilst this I c
cargo Whether or not our I
late calamity could have been prevented by ;
a timely removal of this veflel after the I /
stench was perceived, I will not determine ; I
but a proposal of this kind, would from your
own principles, have been treated by you, I ;
and perhaps by many others with coitempt, I <
and the authors of it stigmatized as being I I
unqualified to difeern the connexion be- <
tween cause and effeft, or as having wilfully 1
(hut their eyes against evidence that would I I
enforce conviftion in every mind not a&uat-1 I
ed by some malignant motiveâor at least they I 1
r would have been charged with having ex-1 <
cited falfe alarms in order to terrify the in- I 1
ir habitants of this city. It may be proper 1
le for me here to remark that although I have I ;
' f mentioned this stench as the cause of the fe-1 i
ver, yet I do not consider this circumstance I
as in every instance neceflary to prove the I 1
exifteno*, thongh in the present cafe it may J
serve to e*tnce the uncommon degree of ac- I
tivity, of the noxious cause that produced
it ; for it is well known that malignant fe- I 1
vers have been generated by the effluvia from I
vegetable putrefaftion when little or per- I
haps no stench was perceived from them at all. I
1 In order to give weight to your opinion, I
e' or rathiir to be conjiflent with your assertion, I
al that the disease was imported by the ship I
id Arethitfa ; you publi(hed a lift of persons I
Â°f w ho were affefted therewith " from the 25th I
ir " July," and commence it with the " pilot of I
the, Arethufa. But had you been free from
n prejudice, and really aftuated by that "pow
erful deftre" to ascertain the origin of the dis
ease, which you fay you are poflefied of,
you would have included in the lift the I
names of those persons who were affefted by
he the fever, before the arrival of the Arethufa,
kc either from your own praftice, or that of
the physicians from whom you collcdted the
cd ' above mentioned lift. I am informed that
several physicians have declared, that they
had cases of the disease before the 25th Ju
a ly ; I hope they "will come to light, as they
will tend more than any other argument to
I be prove, that the disease did not spring from
of the " iufefted bedding and clothes on board
to the Arethufa." A candid investigator into
the history of the fever, will not be content
ed with the agreement in your account of
! the origin of the disease, and of the lirit
UTI p er fÂ° n taken sick from on board the fufpedt
ed veflel, but will inquire into the records
of the health of the city before the period of
her arrival, and if he finds the fame disease
to have then prevailed ; hg will the
(hip and look nearer home-for the origin of
v the calamity.
If any stronger proof could be required
that the disease was Rot imported from the
0 Wsft-Indics, I would adduce the declaration
3n3 ; of Dr. Edv.-ard Stevens, late df St.
* r ' S Croix, and now one of the consulting phy
sicians of the port, who, having witnessed
this fever, in all its ftagea", degrees an J fpe- the
cies, in the city holpitul, lia3, it is find, dc- vail
clafed that it is materially elijirent from the Sn<
yHow fever of tit Weft-Indies : this informs- I b
tism was publiilied on the 18th September, inti
and has, I believe, never been contradidled- cle;
To do away the wtight of this important mi<
argument, it will be said that a different hoi
climate may/o alter and modify the disease, fur
as to present different appearances here, off
fi;om those exhibited in the Weft-Indies: but wa
this is a mere fubterfuge ; for it is this very exl
resemblance which the fever bore to the (In
Weft-India fever tbat was- said to prove the thÂ«
importation of our epidemic. To reconcile ca
therefore the opposite opinions of some of stl
the Philadelphia physicians, and Dr. Stevens, res
it must be observed, that the former speak of
from the descriptions of bceks ; the latter an<
from personai, experience, derived from inj
a lengthy residence in the Weft-Indies, and sic
an extenlive' pradliee among the fever in ne;
queflion. It Â»nly requires common sense fig
to determine which authority is raoft worthy as
I of reliance. th
Thus then I have annslyzed aP. your a- th
| larming (lories, of infeÃed bedding, infilled A
I fails, and infeSed clothes ; and I hart proved ca
I that they amount to nothing! Snppofing M
I it a fadl, what remains to be provtd, that fla
I the two men who died on the 4th June, on th
I bqard the Arethufa, on her passage from th
1 Kingston to Havanna, died of the yellow fa
I fever : No man who is unprejudiced, and va
I will attentively consider wh t I have stated, cc
I can suppose it eonfiftent with reason or the
I nttvne of things, that the above articles, after pi
I being in constant use, and no doubt fre- fr
J quently waflied, or certainly wet with rain, of
I an<T afred on the passage, on board a clean fv
I (hip arriving in ballast and open hatches, in
I could have retained the infedtion in such a ol
state of adlivity as to give the yellow fever, fr
j at the end of fifty days, to the pilot, or to d
the crew of a vessel whose decks they pnffed ei
I over on tlreir way a(hore, and that thefc p*T- 1
I fona (heuld not infedt any others n
I who were exposed to the contagion from at- tl
tending therfi ; at the fame time that these rt
sailors and their clothes, supposed to be ' d
thus highly chafged with infedliop, did not vs
give the fame disease they gave to some peo- tl
pie in the open tir, to others with whom they te
1 lodged. 4 n
â  I It is true, by dinning our ears at the mo- i<
I went of alarm, with the accounts of deaths on v
â¢ board a fufpeHedpip, you did for'a (hort time n
â  I gain your point with many under the inflti- si
' I ence of strong prejudices; but they will now a
I fee how little danger existed from those n
I deaths, by reason of the diltanco of time at t
I which they occurred before the arrival of v
t 1 the vessel, a circumstance which you eare- f
-1 fully concealed, knowing well how greatly f
â¢I it would tend to diminish the confidence in d
â  your opinion of her having thus imported Â£
t I the fever. In fine, your attempt to trace
- I the fever to the fbip Arethufa, is unfupport- (
lled by a Jingle unequivocal faÃ ; but, on the <
- I contrary f your opinion is proved to be un- f
1 founded by the very fad brought forward in its f
\\fupport. Your own " be li if," your own 2
r " CERTAINTY," ERRONEOUS ASSERTIONS, f
-â  suppositions, and ambiguous facts, r
1 I are all you have to offer in its support-; and i
â¢ I they will carry no further weight with them t
-1 than prejudice will efftft. With the can- t
s I did reafoner they will pass for nothing. 5
r I (hall now proceed to detail as coucifely 1
! as possible,' the fadls to prove the origin of )
e I the late epidemic, from the snow Naviga- 1
; tion, from Marseilles. j
r This vessel arrived perfectly healthy on or 1
, about the 24th July, after a passage of eighty t
, I days from land to land, and I was told more ]
r I than 100 days from Marseilles. Her eargo <
â  I confided of a vast variety of perishable arti- ;
y I cles of both vegetable and animal natures. 1
i I Some brandy and red wine were also on i
-1 board. I have authority to state, that the i
y I cargo was received on board, in very bad
-1 order, and during rainy weather. This au- 1
- I thority is from two mercantile men now in
r I this city, who were in Marseilles at the time,
e I and who mentioned the circumstance the
â¢-1 moment they were informed of the snow
el having been fufpefted of introducing the
e disease. The cargo had nearly been Jive
y I months in the hold when (he arrived in this
- I port. I have also authority to state, from
d I a gentleman to whom the captain made the
â¢- I declaration, that ke never had pumped hit
n I vessel during the whole passage ; to use his own
I expression he said " the pumps might as well
1. I have been below." The effect which this
1,1 would have in creating a heat in the hold,
1,1 and a putrefadlion of perilhable materials,
p I previously in a state favorable to that pro
is I cess, must be evident ; and so careful are
th I some matters of vessels, to prevent this tf
of\ feft of a tight (hip upon cargoes liable to
m j heat, that they frequently pour water in
u- I their pumps, and then pump it out again,
if-1 The snow began to discharge hsr cargo on
f, I or about the 27th July, when a very offen
:ie j five smell was frequently perceived to issue
>y from the hold. Several of the erew were
r a, soon after taken sick j one of thera was re
of moved by the health officer to the hospital,
he State-Kland, where he died. His disease
lat was not \.\\efcurvy as stated by the captain
ey of the snow ; for Dr. S". Duffield, confult
u- ing physician of the part, who attended
ey the Crew, informed me he laboured under
to an inflammatory fever, with a pain across
his breast aud (houlders; and it is probable
ird that the bleeding at the mouth, which after
ito wards came on (and which is a well-known
nt- symptom of the late epidemic) gave rife to
of the opinion of the man's disease being the
irft scurvy. Mr. Latimer's business in the fiour
dl- line frequently obliged him to be on the
rds wharf, within the sphere of the extent of
'of the offenfive smell from the fuow. His fer
afe vant man was seen on the wharf on the 29th
:he Jcly, though you fay he was taken sick on
of the 27th. Â°The disease quickly spread to
the whole neighbourhood ; and particularly
red affedled those persons in the range of (lores,
the counting houses and fail-lofts, opposite to
ion the Snow, covering a space of nearly 300
St. feet, from Starr and Pritchetts to Pjne
ay- street, in all of which there were more or
fed less sick. About 'the centre of this space
the Snow lay, and the east winds which pre- can
vailed at the time, set diredlly from the unli
Snow to the houses opposite. This fadl is, hav
I believe, unparallelled in the history of the efp<
introduftion of a fever in this country, and Sta
clearly proves the source of the late epi'de- and
mic. Mr. Tittermary, whose counting- acc
haufe was near the bow of the Snow, as- got
fured me, the exhalation from her was so inf<
off*nfivÂ« he could scarcely bear it ; and I and
was informed of it by many others: it even up
extended as far as the lower fide of Pine- die
street wharf. So sickly were the crew of per
the SnoV, that when (he was requsfted by poi
capt. Young, the harbour mailer, on the to
sth August, to remove, one of the officers the
replied, he could not, from the weak state obi
of the people, without some other afiift- the
ance. They were seen continually re fort- for
ing to the bow of the vessel ia a weak and for
sickly ftnte, and they hung a mat over or or
near the anchor (lock to hide the offenfive j vei
fight from public view. Mr. Lewis who, ! fri<
as mentioned above, was out of town when j th<
the Arethufa arrived, complained much of fnj
this stench, and was taken sick on the ill (la
August. Three men who discharged a thi
cargo from a (hallop, on the south fide of
Mr. Latimer's wharf, and two others in a air
flat at Pine-street, all within the extent of I go
the fhnell, were seized with the fever after I th<
they left the city, which it is said proved ch
fatal to all of them. Even after the remo- gr
val of the snow to Southwark, the people in
continued sickly for some time. w 'i
The captain of the snow, upon my firft ef
publication concerning the stench emitted in
from her, acknowledged the fadt of the so
offenfive smell, but said it proceeded from ft;
five or fix dead dogs which lay putrifying w
in the vicinity of the dock ; yet he and one nl
of his witnesses are at variance as to their m
situation : in fadl, no person can be pro- d'
duced who will assert that he saw them in o
either of those docks, and the fadls which w
1 have stated could be proved by a fnfficiciit 01
number of refpedlable witnesses : indeed, |r
that such -a nuisance (hcuild be fuffered to P
remain in this neighbourhood for several lr
days together, would be a reproach to those
who reside there or frequent it : this cause, 0
therefore, could not have produced the ex- c;
' tensive, permanent stench that was perceived : n
nor did it ppoceed from this bilgc-vvateiâan rt
. idea introduced into several of your letters, P
1 which I believe to be your own, as I havÂ« w
never heard it mentioned by any other per- "
- son. I have lately seen Mr. B. Afhmead, c
r and he confirms what he had mentioned to h
; niyfelf and others, refpedling the stench from h
t the snow Navigation. Mr. Benners, vvho Â«
f was employed as weigh-mafter of this vef- "
- fel's cargo, and who also complained of this 1
r stench, soon after took the prevailing difor- c
1 der, of which he diedâa circumstance I 1'
1 did not mention before. r
6 In your letter to me you fay that " the a
- stench from the snow could not have pro- r
educed the fever; because the exhalation I
- from vegetable matters in a state of putre- '
s fad ion, is laid down by the great Cullen '
i as the cause of intermitting and remitting '
, fevers, and are never contagious." The opi-
, nion of Dr. Cullen, however refpedlable, â >
I is not infallible ; and is opposed by the au- <
u thorities mentioned by Dr. Rulh, to prove <
- that vegetable as well as animal effluvia will Â«
produce contagious fevers. I may also 1
Y mention, that, notwithflanding the opinion <
f I have given above, it is possible there might 1
- have been a combination of both in the car- '
go of the snow Navigation. lamat a loss 1
r to conceive in what refpedls the essential <
y component parts of vegetable and animal '
â e putrefa&ion differ, that they (hould pro- <
o du#e different kinds of fevj;r.âWill the :
i- analysis of the two effluvia into their ulti- I
s. mate principles account for their different '
n effedis upon the human constitution ? I
e (hould be glad of an answer to this query. '
d I conceive that the point can only be de
-- termined by the " pajl experienee" of prac
ji tical physicians ; and this is diredlly in fa
;, vour of the idea (notwithflanding the opi
le nion of Dr. Cullen) that diseases from one
vf source of effluvia are equally contagious as from
le the other. To those who wish fadls in proof,
ve I must refer to the publication of Dr. Rulh
is on the fever of 1793 and 1794.
m As a proof that the heat and stench of
le the hold of a vessel will produce the yellow
it fever, I will mention the following cafe, al
rn ready given to the public. In the year
:11 1793, a E/ench Eaft>lndia (hip was brought
is into the island of Barbadoes by the Britifli
d, lette* of rasrque Pilgrim. The whole if
s, land and the crews of both (hips were heal
-- thy, until the hold of the Indiaman was o
re pened, when an intolerable stench arose, and
:f- vvas found to be occalioned by some bag 9of
to pepper, lying near the pump having rotted.-
in Everyone of the white men belongingto the
n. (hips crew were seized with the yellow fever
in which was very mortal; and it even affedled
n- some of the blacks. From the (hip it soon
ue spread thro' Bridgetown, with unusual ma
re lignity, and swept off several American's
â e- there it the time. This one proof is fuffi
il, cient to (hew that vegetable putrefaSinn is ca
tfe pable of producing a contagious difeaft : Not
lin withstanding your positive assertion to the
It- contrary, and the contemptuous manner in
ed which you speak of those who differ from
ler you in opinion.
sfs I (hall- now conclude by proposing such
ble means as will tend toguardourfea ports from
er- the introdudlion of future malignant fevers,
wn And firft, I would remark, that it is not
to merely the yellow fever from the Weft-In
:he dies that Ike are to fear. We now know that
>ur yellowness is by nomeans charadleriftic of the
the fever so called, and is merely an accidental
of symptom, occurring as often in the true
"er- plague, and in all other malignant fevers,
)th which may be as readily imported by infedt
on ed gOods from Europe, as fevers fiom the
to Weft-Indies. As vessels from Marseilles in
rly the summer, frequently have long passages
â¢es, from 80 to 100 days : as the cargoes bro't
to from thence and the neighbouring ports in
;oo the (heights, are very liable to be damaged
ne- from the causes that operated in the cafe of
: or the snow Navigation, and will consequently
ace emit a fimihr offenfive smell, and as thin "can-
cannot be difcevered by any health officer, '
unless by discharging the cargo, I would
have every veflel from these ports to unload,
especially in the fumnier, at the Hospital,
State Idand ; where store-houses, wharves
and piers (hould be built for the purpose of "
accommodating the fliips and storing the
goods. The articles damaged, or supposed
infe&ed, might then be opened and aired,
and the wine or other liquors on board Tent
up to the city. Vessels from the Weft In
dies, on board of vvln'cb any deaths had hap
pened, or having (hort paffoges from sickly
povts, to perform a quarantine proportioned
to the length of .time since the death, or of
the voyagp : an indijiriminate quarantine aÂ«
observed by our (hipping, is certainly nei
ther just nor necelTary. During the per
formance of qnarantine by any (hip, a per*
son ought to be appointed to (lay on board,
or a guard boat (lationed nigh her, to pre

As a preventive for the generation of foul
air, and the damages which perifliable car
! goes are liable to fufFer from heated air in
the holds of (hips, I am of opinion that ma
chines for the ventilation of veflels are of
great confequerice. Wind fails, tho' ufeful
in empty (hips, or those in ballad, crowded
with people, cannot a<s* at sea in storms,
especially when the hold is full, nor in port
in calm weather. Machines that would af
ford by the motion of the (hip at sea, a con
stant renewal of the air in the hold, or that
when in port, would require but little ma
nual labour to work them, would apply the
mod effectual means of preventing the intro
du&ion of malignant pellilential fevers into
our commeicial cities, whether those fevers
were of foreign produdtion, or of domeftie
origin from imported materials. lam riot
infeufible of the delicate filiation I am nqw
placed in, when the bare mention of my own
invention, may be considered as proceeding
solely from a regard to my own interest ; and
on the other hand my total filenee on this oe
cafioii might be ctmlidered as a desertion of
myown discovery made on the principle here
i recommended. Relying chiefly on the re
, ports of several mailers veflels who have
t witnessed the operation at sea of the machine.
which I have invented, ajid which had been
, conflrufted in their veflels, lam led to bc
i lieve that it will eventually pcoduce the fa
i lutary effeÂ£U which I have mentioned above,
> especially in (hips of the usual size employed â¢
. in the Weft-India or European trads, yet
s I*ll (hips of about four hundred tons burthen,
_ or upwards, their motion at sea being mucli
[ less than in ftnaller (hips the operation of the
machine will be proportionably leflened ;'
e and lam told that in such (hips of which the
. number is fraall, owned in this port, it will
i be necessary that the number and size of the
. machines for ventilation (hould be proporti
n oned to that of the (hip wherein they are
r conftrufted ; and that this may be dope
. without much inconvenience, in the form
, which I now make ufeof; yet even in this
. cafe, it might be proper, especially in calm
e weather at fen, that ventilation (hould be
!1 effe&ed by a little manual )abour occafionaf
-3 ly applied to work one or more of those. raa
n chines, which might be accoraplilhed in less
t time and with one half the labour that is ne
â¢- ce(Tary in any other mode of vestilating the
" 8 hold of loaded (hips that I hare yet heard,
il of ; as a proof of this aflertion, several maf
il ters of fhip3 have informed me, that by or
i- dering hands to work thofc machines only
e about two hours in a day, they found that
i- flour, or other provisions might be preferv
it ed from all damage in the hold of a (hip for
I fevtral months in the Weft-Indies, and fsr
r. eral gentlemen in thi3 eity have also witnes
sed the effeft produced by this machine when
worked in this way, in expelling the foul
i- air from the cabin, (late rooms, and the
i- hold of the ship, and that too where the
it heat as well as the (tench was scarce tole
m rable, to those who had not been accustomed
f, to if : yet after all that I have said, if any
Hi better mode of obtaining this great deside
ratum caÂ» badevifed, let it be adopted; and
as notwithstanding in your firft letter to me,
w you attempted" to ridicule my discovery, ahd
1- ung;nerou(ly to insinuate, that I began to
il- write, merely topu(Fo(F myown invention,
it yet all I (hall fay in reply, is, that every in
(h vention calculatad to lessen human misery,
f- however it may excite the envy or ridicule
I- of fame, will afford pltafui eto every beiie
o- volent mind. When the plague, yellow fe
id ver or any other contagions oifeafe an-ives in
nf a veiTel, and the goods and sick perfensare
d.- landed below, I would have the bofpital well
iie guarded by perfon3 appointed for the ex
er press purpose to cut o(F the communication
;d from those imprudent persons, who might
>n wilh to visit their sick friends, or from the
a- attempts of thieves during the time the
ns goods were exposed to the air. The hofpi
fi- tal should be walled in, and gate keeper*
a- appointed to live in small houses at the gate#

he and preventing or of giving timely notice of

in) While however care is taken to prevent
disorders from abroad, let us not forget that
ch danger attends us at home. Popular pre
im judicey!( which it rauft be granted is very nat
rs. Ural) has hitherto induced mod of us in A
ot merica to ascribe all our epidemics in sea
tn- port towns to importatation from the Weft
lat Indies ; while the fame natural' prejudice
:he leads the people there to deny strenuously
tal the charge of their occasional epidemics o
-ue rignating among them ; but to ascribe them
:rs, uniformly toJlaveJhips. But malignant df
Â£t- cases occur too frequently in our country,
the and at too great a dillance from sea ports to
in permit us to iirfpute them always to foreign
ges infection. They can originate in any place
o't and in any climate, provided the causes capable
in of producing them exifi. The phyficiaus of
red Baltimore and Norfolk have ascribed the
â¢of diseases which have lately affli&ed tho r e
itly places to the exhalations of the place ; and
an- as it t$ known that the yellow fever has ge-' tie-rally cnmnrtnced its. fatal attacks in the
vicinity of wharves, it is probable that in ad
dition to the caiife 1 ? already mentioned, a
predisposition to take this disease may be in
duced by breathing an atmosphere loaded i
with vegetable aid animal putrefaftion ex- (
haling from the hqlds of faveral vessels that <
fnay happen to unload near other.. If <
the principle of inflammability in the human '
constitution produced by this cause, Ihould
not be fufficient to give rife to a yellow fe- 1
ver, it might be kindled into a flame by the J
sparks from vegetable putrefaftion, the ar- j
tides of which might be landed on the <
wharve:, from the rubbish of their cargoes, t
or from the filth among their ballad. Hence i
these causes of disease may be removed, by i
firft expelling the foul air from the holds of
the (hips, or removing its ofFenfive contents I
as soon as discharged ; or obliging the cap- '
tain to throw them out below the city, or
upos Windmill Island : and if all our docks
were filled up, and the wharves extended to
low water mSrk, much exhalation would ,
be prevented, and the'health cf those nigh
them amended. ~
An opinion has gone forth, that if it be
established that the yellow fever can oriiri
natcamong ourselves, the reputation of the .
â¢ country will be injured ; and with this pÂ«p-'
ular idea you have concluded your last letter
to me ; but I liope our citizens will'bc con- '
vinced, that their true interest consists in ,
believing " that our public health
depends ourselves." To destroy j
this belief, " is to do an essential inju-i
ry to all populous cities" : for who ;
can be so blind as not to fee, that nndev this
imprefllon, the probable means of preventing I
a subsequent attatk of'a fffalignant fever, by
an attention to the removal of the domestic <
causes, are infinitely 'more within our con- 1
troul, than any that can be applied to pre- ;
vent its importation, if jt can only be intro- '
duced by ficl persons, or infeÃed clothing, as 1
you have so often asserted. What city can 1
be secure, as long as it is in the power of any i
captain, or any fail or to smuggle in a sick i
person, or some old jacket of their defceaf
ed comrades, ieyind the pefftbility of detedion
by your/elf, or any health officer in the w{jrld.
Nothing fhortof obliging every vefTtl indif
crihiinately to unload at the fort, and sub
mitting every article and package :n the (hip
to infpeÂ£tion, could jnake this discovery.
And if this were to take place, commerce
would be at an endâindeed were it poflible
to prove this fatal disease could enter at no
other avenues than those you have opened
for it, and those too, without the power of
human vigilance, I (hould join mod heartily in
the words of your last address to me, in de
ferring our devoted city, and feelc an asylum
in a climate where we might be fafe from
tire deplorable cffe&a of such an opinion.â
Yet (Till I hope that our situation is not so
hopelek as you have represented it, and that
there ate still means within our power, to pre
vent afeturn of the awful calamity.

CALCUTTA, January 28.
The masquerade at the' Caltut-a theatre o*
WcdnfiTday lift was, as is usual with entertain
mitts of that nature is this country, but thinly
attended
Tho charai?er9 were very fÂ»w, and in general
but indiffsrentVy fupportrfi; thÂ« only exceptions
to the stupidity of theevfning, were u couple of
excellent MaUays, a Savoyard, and an old woman, j
/.atnaiin Shah made his triumphal entry into |
Lahore, thi> capital of the Siicks, on the firft day I
cf this month." We can rflert, nr. the authority
of lettera received yeficrdsy from Futtyhur that |
the report of Zemauu Sh.ih - s retreat. is wholly j
without foundationâon thÂ«? contrary, Inwasprc- ;

that he is accompanied by a Frenchman, late am
bafiador from the convention ts Conflantinople
In the papers of news transmitted from the
weftwafd, an t flsttd the firlt of Rajib, is 'he
purport of a letter, said to have been received by
Zemaun Shah from Shah Allum.
After complimen s, exprefliÂ»Â» of the gladness
he feels in the approach, through the divme in
terpv.fition, of rhÂ«j faviar of tht defend
ant of Tinmr obfcrves, " that .Hind or Hindof
tan . has fallen a facrifice to tha degeneracy of her
A*(>ies: and that it behoves him. through whole
.means ihe fpUndor ot the (late is to bereilored,
tohafteir with diligincc to fucconr the brave."
F.xtrafl of a letter from Futtyghnr, dated the
Bth inllant.
u By the last accounts, Zemaun Shah had
pafled Rotas, a fining fort on the weft of the
Jelilum, about seventy cofsfrom the Attoi;k,and
about eighty cofs from the Lahore The cols
of that country is estimated at one mile and an
half, he was therefore about 120 miles from La
hore ; Lahore by diredl road is 250 miles from
Dehli or .57? miles.
â¢< Tfe Shah-iaftytsr conquered all the coun
try between Indus and tiie Jehlum, which com
prizes nearly a fourth Â«f the Sheick's country,
extending from the Ghaul leading to Calhe
mire, to the vicinity of the Moultap, and his
objeift apparently is, to fubgite the countries
Jytng between the Jehlum and the Chunaub, and
between this river and the Rawee, as far as
Lahore. Another seas n may secure to him the
Panjab ; but until he (hall have by viilories in
those parts secured to his troops an gninterrup
edpafiage, there cannot surely beanyferieus
alarm from hira "

On Tueftay next will be launched a ftip of

Foreman andÃ?cen, at Howrath.
Ext raft of a letter from Futtyghur, dated
Jan. 28.
11 We ate now encamped, about two cof3
from Futtyghur, in a westerly direftion,
where we wait the arrival of the Cawnpore
forces; which will be joined by the Nabob's
troops at Kanouge.
" Should necessity require it, which how
ever Ido not think will be the cafe. I pre
sume we (hould all make ? movement to
wards Delhi.
" The persian paper of yesterday, from
Delhi, which is now before me, mentions
.as follows:
Â« Zemaun Shah had formed his army in
to seven divisions, and endeavoured by dif
ferent roads to surprize the rear of the
Sticks, but being unfuccefsful, had again
united his forces.
" A mod desperate battle was fought at
Umrootfur: it commenced at eight o'cloqk
iti the morning, when the Shah opened his '
(huter renauls, or wall pieces mounted on
camels, upon the Seicks, ant} both parties
commenced a heavy fire with matchlocks,
which continued till two o'clock.
" About this time the Seicks, finding
they had made no impression 011 the en?my,
gave the figual for,a general charga; aiida
greable to their mode in close combat, flung ,
away their turbans, let loose tli<;ir hair, put
their beards in their mouths, daflied
into the midst of the Abdallah amy, sword
in hand.
" The Aklar fays, the two armies con
tinued thjis engaged for four hours, when
Zemaun's troops gave away, and were per
fued by the SeicksÂ» to the very entrance of
Lahore.
" It is mentioned that 3J,000 men were
killed in this engagement â20,000 on the j
part of the Shah and 15,000 of the Seicks."
The Shah was said to have been in La
hore, fortifying the city, and was expe&ed
to leave it by the 25th of December, for
Delhi. It is supposed he in tended to gar
rison Lahore, and make it his principal de
pot.
Zematui Shah is the second son of the ce
lebrated Timur, on whose death his elder
brother, Hnmaion, succeeded to the throne
but was soon deposed and imprisoned by the
address of Zemaun, who immediately usur
ped the government,for which it mull be ac
knowledged his talents were better suited,
than those of his brother.
Humaion is still living, closely confined as
a (late prisoner, at some distance from Ca
bul. He is reported to have many adherents,
and these partizans have more than once
open.y manifefted a disposition to restore
him to the throne. It was a measure of
this kind which obliged Zemaun,on a former
expedition to the Panjab, precipitately to
return to Cabulfton, where his presence
speedily re-eftablifhcd his authority.
Count Gika, a Georgian, well known in
Calcutta, a few years ago, and nephew to
the famous Heraclius, prince of Georgia, is
said to be prime secretary, and adviser of
Zemaun Shah.

This is to inform you, that after we had

failed from Rangoon on the 18th of No

with the mates of the (hip ; the chief mate
named Hoofon Caun, and the second Ma

ble we arrived fafe at the Braces, in order
to meet the pilot; on the 19th December
we saw three pilot schooners, which gave us
hopes of conveying us speedily into the riv

on board immediately and took charge of
the (hip; and a few hours after, we disco
vered a (hip with Dani(h colours, which (hip
proving to be of the French made prize of
the three aforefaid pilot schooners and last
ly captured our (hip the Dodelay, and (hip
ped 011 board of us a fufficient number of

But his arguments proving ineffeftive, We
and the mates went on board of the Freneh
(hip and argued the cafe in as strong terms
as p&lible, but the French replied, that
they pay no attention either to the Burmah
pass or colours, and that they will upon no
account deliver up the (hipâwhen we found
us thus situated, we requested to know of
the cemmander of the French (hip, named
Legeras, the name of his (hip, and to whom
(he belongedâto which he replied, that the
owner of the French (hip is called Monf.
Melartic, and the (hip is called Lentrinch,
mounting 22 gunsâand thus having ended
the conversation, he told captain Lauricro,
that he mull go to Mauritius, and that all
the Moors would be sent on (horc; when a
long boat was immediately prepared, iu
which we were ordered to get, together
with the crew us a (loop from Pegu, belon
ging to a merchant there (which they lika
wife captured off the Negraes) in all confid

at Ganjam,at which place we arrived,after 6

we have to do now is to proceed to Madras
