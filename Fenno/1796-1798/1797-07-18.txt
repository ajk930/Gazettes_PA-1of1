FOR carrying into effeiS thejlxth article of the
treaty of amity,commerce and navigation, con
cluded bet ween his Erit.nnic maj; sty ?nd the United
States of America, en the 19th day of November,
1794, having this day conltituted tkeir Board,
putfuant aad agreeably to the said treaty, do here
by give notice, that they are ready to proceed to
bufinefa accordingly; and they desire that all claims
under the fain article (which so far asthe fame de
scribes the cases thereby provided for, is hereunto
annexed) may be lodged with their Secretary with
out delay.
1 hey further desire that all such claims may not
only state in what manner the several cases come
within the defcriptioH of the said article, but also
specially set forth .he nature of the evidence by
which the claimants refpeAively undertake tefub
ftantiate the fame.
Extradl from the said article,
" Whereas it is alledgcd by divers Brltifh mer
" chants, and ethers his majeft)'s fubjeds, that
" debts to a eonfidrrabla amount, which were bona
" fide contracted, before the peace, Trill remain
" owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the
" United States; and that by the operation of va
" rious lawful impediments, since the peace, not
" only the full recovery of the said debts has been
" delayed, but also the value and security thereof
" have been in several instances impaired and lc(T
---" ened, so that by the ordinary courle of judicial
" proceedings, the Britifii creditors cannot Bow
" obtain and a&ually have and receive full and
" adequate compcnfation for the losses and dama
" ges which tney have thereby fuf.ained: It is a
" greed that in all such cases where foil compenfa
" tion for such losses and damages caruwt fat what
" ever reason be aflu lly obtained, bad and recei
" ved by the said creditors in the ordinary courfj
" of justice, the United States will make full and
" complete compensation for the fame to the said
" creditors : but it is diftindlly understood, that
" this provision is to extend to such losses only as
" have been occasioned by the lawful impediments
" aforefaid, and is not to extend to losses occasion
" ed by such infelvency of the debtors or other
" causes, as would equally have operated to pro
" duce such loss, if the said impediments had. not
" existed ; nor to furh losses or damages as have
" been occasioned by the manifeft delay, ornegli
'â¢ fceucc, or wilful omiflion of the claimant."

(or adiding Britidi creditors, and iuch particular a
gents as they may specially authorize, 111 prosecuting
their claims before the cemmidioners for carrying'in
to effetf the sixth article of the Treaty of Amity, Com
merce and Navigation between his Britannic and
the United Stales of America, hereby gives noi ice that
he has opened hii offi e at his bouse the south ealt
corner of Chefnut and fifth drrcts, Philadelphia,
where he is ready to receive all claims or inltrufiiuus
for claims with the vouchers aud documents thereof,
for the purpose of bringing forward the fame agree
ably so the rules and orders which tbe board may
think proper to prescribe.
And as it will be for the intered of all concerned,
that the several claims be so dated, aad Upport
ed, as to prevent the delay which would arise from
the necessity of obtaining further information, or ad
ditional materials,from persons redding at a distance,
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the
direction chiedy of tbofe, who, not having employ
ed particular agents, may leave the prosecution of
their claims te his charge and management) that all
such claims ought in particular to set forthâ
id. The proper defCripiion and fitnation of the
creditor or claimant, and original debtor, reflect

debt.
3d. When, in what manner, and to what extent,
the creditor or claimant was prevented or impeded,

decisions and pratiice of courts, or teflraint of exe
cution, from recovetiug payment of the debt in
quedion.
4th The loss and damage incurred or fudained,
in consequence of such impediments, whether the
fame may have arifcn from the infolveuev, Change of
situation, or death of the debtor, the loss of legal
remedy from lapse of time, or other causes impairing
the value and lecurity of the debt, which would not
have so operated if such impediments had notexided.
And jth The pattiCular grounds and reafoas on
which the claimant maintains, in the terms of the
treaty, thai " by the ordinary courte of judicial pro
ings, the creditor cannot now obtain and adually
have aud reccsve full and adequate compensation" for
the lolfes and damages so fudaiued.
The general agent thinks it bis duty further to fug
ged that the several claims ought 10 be accompanied
and fupperted by the affidavits of the claimants duly
sworn and regularly atteded, both as to the exidence
of the debts claimed, and such other ciicumlbnces
as may be within their pwn knowledge refpeftively.
And wherever the claimants in dating the nature of
their evidence (which mud in everv indance be the
bed of which tbe cafe is capable) have occadon to
icfer to the tedimony of witnesses, it will be proper
to apprifethe general agent of the names and places

REMARKS OK
THE Â« FEAST OF REASON: c
At NF.tr-rORK. j
It is not pretended, that the Devils, after j
their expulsion from Heaven, held feftivals 1
to commemorate their descent into Hellâ | â
the event was of too disastrous a nature to i J
afford cause for merriment. But our Jaco- (
bins, who, for impudence and wickedness, t
outstrip the Devils themselves, do not hesi
tate to assemble and rejoice at their own ex- j
clufion from the virtuous part of society, and ,
to express their impious wifheÃ, that all ho
nest men might become Devils, or what is
infinitely worse, Jacobins. Upon these cc- (
cafions, however, the chair is never filled ]
with one of the members of the society, but
by some weak man, who, to gratify his ri- |
diculous vanity, seeks for praise, where
praise is censure. That this charafter is (
ilrickly applicable to General Gates, who ,
presided at the feaft, cannot be denied,;âhe j
always entertained an opinion, in which j
opinion he' now supported by the Jacobins, ,
that to his marvellous exploits we are in
debted for our independence. How far it ]
is confident with truth, to attribute the cap- ,
ture of Burgoyne's army exclusively to the
good conduft of General Gates, is submitted ,
to those persons, who recolleft the able as
sistance he derived from a Lincoln, a Stark,
and a .GloverâNay, the laurels with which
the patriots at New-York are so desirous of
adprning the brows of their chairman, were
culled in part by Benedict Arnold, whose
health might have been drank at the Kinta
koy-s without fubjedling the company to the
charge of inconfifteney ! Let it also be re
memberedi for the honor of tbofe officers
who commanded under General Gates at
Saratoga, that they have never claimed any
(hare of the glory he acquired at the battle
of Camden.
The objetft of this feaft it seems, was to
afford his Grace the Duke of Chantilly,
an opportunity of explaining in confidence
to his bosom friends, the motives which
governed his conduct during his million to
the five titular Kings of France. If his>
Grace has been accused of rendering his
tedious and unthankful embajfy profitable to
himfelfâif he ha 6 been fufpefted of exert
ing his abilities and influence to promote the
views of the Dire&oryâthe mode taken to
vindicate himfelf by appealing to the enemies
of his country ; I mean the United States,
was truly unfortunate. No man can ex
peÂ£t to cleanse himfelf from filth by plung
ing into a common fewer. But his Grace
(who never does things by halves) being
determined to juftify the executive for re
calling him ; he at the feaft aforefaid, sport
ed the following toafl as a proof of his
firm attachment to the independence of the
United States.â" Perpetual union between
the republics of America and France." Be
fore we pronounce sentence however upon
his Grace, 1 it will be proper to enquire into
the meaning of the word Union, as applica
ble to a political conneftion between two
independent sovereign States. Does it im
ply alliance ? No. Does it fignify harmony
or friendfhip ? No. What then is the true
fignification of Union in the cafe now before
uÂ» ? One and indivisible. When Scot
land was united to England, it was called
the Aft of Union. When the convention ,
by their decree, annexed Belgium and Savoy
to France, it was'ftyled the Union of Belgum
and Savoy with France. Other examples
might be cited if necessary ; but it is con
ceived, that those already quoted are fuffi
cient to demonstrate the extreme solicitude
' on the part of his Grace, to relieve his coun
trymen from the trouble and vexation, inci
dent to governing themselves.
The fifth and twelfth toasts roared out at
the Feast of Reason, may be considered as
two of the many instances, in which ihe gen
uine republicans of the North, when inspired
by grog, have not only flapped themselves
in the fafej but insulted their brethren of
the South. The imprecation invoked upon
the Demons of tyranny and the enemies of
freedom, can only apply in this country to
: Jacobins and Cave holders.
> How the Patriots of New-York, who
: have no lamb now to prey upon, nor any
hopes of extrafting gold from sands, will
find means to pay for their dinner is difficult
to sayâunless indeed the Tavern-keeper
consents to take a bill on Viftor Hugues,
payable out of the proceeds of American
cargoes condemned for trading under the
fanftion of treaties and the laws of nations.
COMMUNICATIONS.
' The faftion which is at this moment ta
king exttaordinary measures to prepare the
way for the introduftion of a foreign power
irito this country, have recourse to one sin
gular expedient. In order to reconcile the
public mind to a fubtniflion to French do
mination they fay " that the people detest
â¢ the Britifti government and its meafnres; the
administration [of our government] on the
contrary love every thing British." Any
other assertion might be made with equal
propriety: It is as unfounded as the preten
sions of this faftion are to paCriotifisi. It is
not possible to conceive of greater turpitude
than that which aftuates these embosomed
enemies of our country. In order to en
courage aij invasion of the United States
they attempt to fever the people from their
government; failing in this, they publish and
continue a series of falfe intelligence, lies and
flanders, calculated to influence a nation pro
fefling friendfhip for us and in treaty with
us, to- change her system, and aftually to
make war on our essential interestsâand fav
ored by distance and a concurrence of cir
cumflances, they opÂ°rtly exult that their in
fernal machinations are pushed to the point
of direct ar.d g:enentl hostility end ;nvyÂ£f:on !
Should the United States, which I eaveii
forbid, be unfortunately involved in a fo
reign war, whatever may be the issue, '.here A
is no truth tnore clear and certain than tl is, *"
that all the horrors and calamities incident
to such an event, will tie juftlj: chargeable
to the men J .vho coiifature th{ faftion that
is now laboring to weaken the union, and to
destroy the con.idence of the people in their
own government. "
FaÃion always the fame.
"The faftiori which is now at work td
bring the people of the United States under
a foreign yoke, is COmposed of the fame
fort of men, with the addition of a number
of imported kindred spirits who oppofei
the treaty of peace in 1783âthey then dit
graced the country in ftveral places by vio
lent resolutions against foroe of the articles.'
The people knew their ownintereils, and the
faftion was silenced.
After fuffering every species of misery and
disgrace for fume yeers, the federal govern
ment was adopted, flGtwithftanding the op
pofitioh of this faftion. Time and experi
ence have contradiflfd all their predictions.
The war in Europe pointed out the line
of duty, interest and policy for the United
StatesâNeutrality. The fafli&n opposed
this. Here they again failed. The people
by their representatives approved the moa
fure.
Our neutral rights were invaded ; war or
negociation were the alternative. The
latter took place, and the people were fatis
fied. It is true, the faftion printed a pe
tition at the feat of government,* and cir
culated it thro' the union, but the signers
were as a drop to the ocean, compared to

And really, Sir, we are the wittiest people
, on earth. Every thing serious or sacred is
1 I made a jest ofâto come, to an untimely
â  i end, is only " to go off at the d?opâand
â  to die in one's bed is, 'â  to kick the buc
ket." x To be on the verge of bankruptcy,
. a situation not the molt desirable, is only to
. be dished âand there are above fifty, pret
ty, witty, genteel and foft expressions, to
denote that imitation of brutality, druk
i kenne'ss. A man is affronted, if youttll
. him that he was drvn kon such a day ; but
1 he takes it as a compliment, if you infinu
; ate that he was " a little groggy,"âor
" " how came you so ?!! To accuse a gen
-1 tit man of adulter y would probably pro
f duce a challenge ; but to whisper that he
1 has had an " affair of gallantry" with
Mrs. â, is tie moil nioft pleasing flat
-1 tery. Should you be so very dull and stu
pid, as to accuse another of murder, it is
[ ten to one but he "brings you into the Court
of King's Bench ; whereas if you praise
â  him for behaving as a man or honor, when
he pinked the fellow whose wife or daugh
i ter he had debauched, he. will lhake hands
â  with you most cordially.
Indeed, fir, this is carrying things too far.
It is being witty overmuch, when by such
fine and polite expressions, we familiarize
ourselves to crimes, which never ought to
be mentioned without abhorrence. The
â¢ proper fubjeft for the exercise of wit fe&ns
to be exhausted, and proper places are >
changed- for others not quite so proper.â
Hetice we may hear of a roar of laugh
ter in the Senats ; a general smile on
the face of the whole congregation in a
church ; and a good joke, which makes
even the judges laugh, in a CouÃTof Jus
i Tice ! While our play houses are as dull as
. conventicles, and our plays contain every
! thing, "except that which provokes mirth. '

1 certain portion of the vis comica; but

Americans who have listened to ttie de

was guided." Thus far the citizen minister;
but what has been the language of faftion ?
this is the purport of itâthat the govern
ment of our country has been afliduous in
i. the manifeftation of hatred and enmity to-
.vards Prance ; that it has Mnceallngly
fought to f'avQur Great-Britain, to the pre
judice of " our alius." Malignant and nn
founded as are these charges, and depraved
and alienated from love of country as are the
authors of them, yet a partial credence of
jucK statements has been impressed on the
minds of many. No truth whatever rests
upon a more solid balls than thisâthat it
has. been the object of the American Ad
ministration to preserve a ft rift and inviola
ble neutrality during the European war.
e t neutrality was not the objeft of France
whatever they profelfed, through the organ
' of their firft minister to this country, after
the commencement of the revolution, it is
welj known that while he was soothing our
executive with the sweet founds of" JlJler
reupblichis pocket contained instructions
to a roil fe the people to make a common cause
with France, if the governmentrefufed toun
furl the banners of war. In return for the
unwearied attempts on the part of America
to preserve animpartial line of conduft, what â 
have we experienced from the French J ;
what but an attempt to devide the people i
' from the governmentâthe plunder and rob- ]
b<?ry of our citizens, even to a degree beyond <
the infamous piracy Â©f the Bermudians ? i
And is France to be juftified, because we 1
have also been robbed and insulted by the I \
Britifii ? Or, is the juftification derivable j i
from the founds lilerty and equality : Too
much have these founds already warped the I
judgments ofmanyandledthemto overlookas y
abuliae conduft as ever one independent na- ]
tion experienced from another. It is hoped i
there are few, in our country who would not t
rejoice at the eftablilhment of the real liber- v
ty and happiness of the people in any quart- n
er of the globe ; and it is also hoped there a
are few who will be so far duped as to juftify fj
a power, which, while profefling the'eftab- n
lifhment of liberty as its objeft, in the plen- p
itnde of conquest tramples npon the rights, r
and insults the authority of a people who o
have a just claim to freedom and independ- Â«
ence. j
It is quite fafhionable with some to speak I
of those as attached to the Britifli, who re
present the conduft of the French towards vt
this conntry in its proper light : this may fr
be attributed to the spleen of party. An ft
American may deleft those who speak to as
undermine the pillars of our happiness, jn
without indulging an unjuftitiable predilec- ti,

ar " " I fend you by this opportunity a recent
- e : work of Mr. Necker, upon the French re
?an volution ;it has been some weeks published,
â tcr but I have not been able, until a few weeks
I 15 ago, to procure a copy of it here ; I have
3"r tlot yet had the time to read it through my
ter felf. I know not whether the government
ins of the United States have ever thought an
"J e attention to the literary part of European
m- politics a fubjeft of inftruftion to their mi
he nifters abroad. There is a certain class of
'ca publications which have a direst and im
iat portant conneftion with the course of events
h J and with the views of nations, courts, par
ties, faftions and individuals,; this is no
h- secret to yo*. In the present lituation of
"d our affairs, and the designs which at least
5 â¢ one European power has with regard to the
" e j United States, it is neceflary to be upon the
he j watch for every gleam, that may cast a light
>le upon the systems which Comprehend us.
30 Â«My lltuatfon is not peculiarly favora
iie ble for this particular : I find it difficult to 'â¢
as procure the publications which appear in
a- England, and very seldom can receive them,
-d until a long interval has intervened. Even
ot those of France do ji'ot reach this country :
r- very early ; and there are none that origi- 1
t- nate here. There is not any more certain ]
re and equivocal mark of the deplorable declen- 1
y fion of this nation in importance than this ; 1
S- not one publication of the least note has bee* .
t- produced by the Dutch press since I firft ar- 1
rived here ; and whenever I get intimation j
0 of any new work, I find myfelf obliged to t
1- wait for it, until it can be procured from f
London or Paris, from Lausanne or Bade, t,
k Hamburgh or Berlin. , p

Is will perhaps supply me better and mote o

ing to America, with some of the obferva- m
â ' tions which occur to me upon perusal, tho' o
lam sensible that this last will be the most Â»
unnecefiary part of the plan. g
â¢ " Tojudge aceutately upon this work of f (
Necker, it is neceflary to remember who, p
" and what the author has been, and what he h
II poflibly has hopes of becoming again. I sent tl
1 you not long since the work of his daughter, N
Madame de Stael, and mentioned one ofher ft
1 objefti ip writing that book. She has now h
5 returned to Paris } let me'further observe, b
that it was by her exertions the decree in h:
favor of M. de Talleyrand, permitting his zi
return, was passed ; the fame party procured h'
the fame decree in favor of the general Mon- 01
' tefquiou : they are endeavoring to obtain aj
' the liberation of M. de la Fayette. Lally, e>
1 in London, who belongs likewise to the fame m
party, has lately published a book in favor m
of the emigrants, and in this instance, with pt
' the fame effeft.wfiich his former efforts have ic
â¢ uniformly produced, of injuring his own
cause by his impetuosity. This whole par
' ty is detested by the preient Fi ench govern
' ment. Every one of the five direftors hatei ra
them, *ith the inveteracy of a neighborly tit
hatred ; I>ut the force of the opinion pub- in:
| lique, to which they are all equally slaves, Ci
has made a fort of compofitipn with them ca
abfohitdy necessary. They, on their part, uti
advance as far as they can, to meet the fyf- hi]
tcm of the day ; and thus you can observe, rel
in the midst of the nioft violent oppositions. th.
a disposition to conciliate benevolence, even thj
by courting prejudices, and facrificing prin- wl
ciples, all but those in which the views of thi
the refpeflive individuals are involved. This pei
circumftahce accounts for the great differ- fin
ence between the sentiments of Mr. Necker no
now publifned, and those of Madame de th<
Stael, in the work which I lately sent you. up

There are numerous indications in these unt

n ~ various circumstances now lead me to a dif

or from the pamphlet of Theremin, which I sent
lit you a few days ago. You will find in the
lie newspapers which I ferd you at this time,
*e that Thomas Paine has left Paris, and is go- i
, in ? to America; another of the French
papers fays he is going with Mr. Monroe
a " "to repair the mrfcWef dorte by the admi- 1
to migration of Washington.
in " The plan of the western republic, in
*, alliance of France, to oppose against the !

y have been formed as early as the time of Ge- 1
i- net's inftruftions; how much earlier it was '
in formed, it is perhaps not necessary to conjee- J.
i- tureâthat Paine was in the secret, originally,
Â» seems probableâthat he is now going to r
Â» America to promote the design, I firmly n

pamphlet against the late President, I have E

, French government calculate* that in the

country, and perhaps the southern states,

MORGAN J. RHEES.
No, 177, SouthSecond-ltreet,Philadelphia.
Ths purchafersoriotsin Bern.a have the following
prÂ°fje4ls of appreciating thtir property :
1. It is remrte irom any other town, and sur
rounded by great bodies of excellent land, capable
of producing every kind of grain and vegetables,
and is without doubt one ef tbebeft grazing coun
tries in the Vnited States.
In point of health the situation is not exceed
ed by any on the continent.
' 3- BeGdes numerous springs jnd runs, of the fin
eft quality, there is a creek for water works (011
which mills are now building) running through the
town,
4 The public road from Philadelphia to Pittf
h'irgh will go through it, which beinf moreJevel
end nearer than any other rout must become uni
reffally travelled : aided by the navigation of Ju
niata and Conemaugh, goods may be conveyed at
lead a or 3 dollars per cwt. cheaper from the for
mer (9 the latter place, than by the old road thro'
Bedford.
5. Being in the centre of a fleuriihing fettle
meat, Â«nd taking in the shortest portage between
the eastern and western waters, it is likely to be
come a deposit for stores, a manufacturing town,
and a feat of justice. Besides the old fettl.rs, up
wards of one hundred emigrants have fettled in the
vicinity of Beula, since last Oitober, and many
more have engaged to join them thisfummer.
6. A Land-Qflice for fupply>ing ai3u.il settlers
with farms to a considerable amount, and in vari
ous situations, will be immediately opened in the
town. The proprietors of land in the circumja
cent country art felicited to fend their drafts and
t:rms of fate, or leafing, to Thomas Jonis, Sur
veyor, in Beula, who will give security for any
trust reposed in him : with such co-operating aid,'
the progress of the settlement wi 1 be the more ra
pidly advanced and extended to diftam townships.
7. A public library for the benefit of the fettltrs,
will be established in the town, towards laying the '
foundation of which, upwards of one thousand
volumes are already purchased and principally feat
forward.
8. Two hundred acres of land adjojning (he
town, bv-fides lots and fubferiptions,will be applied
tp support a miniller and j.i eceptor, capable of
teaching the ufeful and liberal arts.
9. After defraying nectffary expences, the mo
ney arising from the present sales will lie laid out in
public buildingsâA place of worlhip, school
hculr and library room, are the firft objcSs.
IÂ«. Every profefiiotial man and mechanic, on
condition ot building ahoufe with a stone or biick
chimney, and residing in it, before the firft of No
vember next, will bÂ« entitled to four lots gratis,
f. tAfurcver from grÂ»und rent. Five and ten acre
out lot; may likewise be obtained on reasonable
terms.
The two central streets in Beula are 100
feet wide, and the others 80 feet. Reserved fquarcs
ond other accommodations must add to the health
and beauty of the place.
