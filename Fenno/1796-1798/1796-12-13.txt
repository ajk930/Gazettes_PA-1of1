Remarks on â >. fdet's lajl addreft.
DURING thefeventy years of war, with which
i New-England was 'io ttrribly fcotirged, the French
7 lupplied not only arms, but gospel missionaries to
6irp& the use of them. Who taught their con
verts to believe, that JÂ«fas Christ, the friend of
poor Indians, was bor*i of a French woman, and
fuflkred death by the hands of ExgH/bmen.âlt was
'â  ju ft as much the defignaf that preaching to do good
to the Indians, as it was of the interference of
France in '78 to do good to America.âHer sole
objeiS was to " divids and rule." 1
Many have long been deceived with regard to
the latter part, as it refpe&s tlnVfcountry ; but <
France does not wiih them to be deceived any lon- '
ger, and has thro.vti off the made. Confident that
vigoiy in other cauntiief, and esrruplioH in this, '
have prepared the way ; fne avow 3 the design of '
appointing for us a chief magidrate, and taking 1
the government under her own contronl, - -She did I
the fame for Geneva ; (Tie Has done the faTC for '
Holland ; and claims a J"fecial right to do it for us,
' on the score ot having fayed us from Great-Britain,
and made us what we are.
Other reasons are also in the aldrefs. a
Particularly, that we have flapped quarreling iv'ith r
the Britifh âfor that is the amount of it. As to 3
the fuggsftion that the treaty of London interferes
with that of Vei failles, or " grants eonvncrcial '
advantages to Great-Britain that are denied to 1
France it i? a sheer lieâand too easy of detec- *
tion to have been told by a minitter, but for the v
purpose of keeping blockheads in countenance who "
had told it before. No, the offence i* that we have
not gone to war, nor faffered to continue a quarrel, v
which would have kept us attached to France, and P
Wind to her ambition.âShe can now no longer P
iruft us to prejudices ; and therefore impute* fhac- "
kles. . c
It ii also among the allegations, that velfclsplaim- P
ed as prizes to French privateers, have in 0111 porn ' !
been " liberated:"- I âTlwy have so. x. Where the "
vcflel was AmÂ«ricanor neutral property. 2. Where ' r
it had beer captured within our w ters 3. Where t!
captured by a privateer fitted oat within the United e '
SiatcJ. In those cases, and there has been no o'het, P
liberation wasty" right claimable from the jurifdic- ''
tion Â»f the country ; and nit opposed by treaty. If P'
any lawyer has a doubt to the contrary, he will o- *
blige the public by dating it But where French
privateers legally filled out and ccmmiffioned, have ' 4 :
captured enemies upon the high fees, and
brought them into the ports of the United States, ej
whi.h is the cafe provided fa/ by the treaty ; none
have been liberated f nor have any been fnbjedkd te n
enquiry except under suspicious circumllanccs, up- th
011 a claim of their being within one of the time
description* before dated ; and then not a moment
longer than was cflential for the investigation of ta
such claim. AH which Adet knew perfetffy well, te
as did every body elseâbut people in the back &
country, for whom doubtless this charge was Inten- w
dcd. The fuggedion on the other hand, that the nc
government or the people connived at the fitting out Â®
ot Britilh privateers, or erer knew of any, merits
no an liver but that difgraceful one, that during the
g period alluded te, the French had a mob in every
principal port, to screen their q,wa villainy from
jufttcr, and to insult BritxOi merchantmenâsome of
wttich were burned.
n ' So long as the French could induce Americans,
0 *1 they did for two years at the fouthwsrd, to fit P '
e out pnvateers usder their commiflions, and thereby eL
g enrage the Britilh to retaliate upon us ; things work m
'â¢ as they would have thrm. And it was the fi Ha l m
J diicoiicertiOÃ of that game by government, after it â¢
.. had tr !Â« ed 118 of milliona, and prepared so. us V
n a war,*- that coriftitutes the real ground of offence * '
on_the lubjeftof privateeringâand rendt*, it ne
cefaary to put th; government into other hands.
