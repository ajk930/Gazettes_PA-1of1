For the Gazette of the United Stats.6.
t-IR. FEN NO,
THERE is a certain c'afs of people in
*ur country, who term therrtfelves " exclu
sive patriots''*â" true republicans." Some
of thefs men are perpetually railing at the
mcafures of our general government, and
abuling thole characters which have been
felefted by the citizens of the United State>
to fill the higheil ofaces. These people
have oftea talked of B itifii influence and
British gold. They have, on ail becafmns,
pt'oteftcS that a fhamcfnl prediledion sot
. the British government has infliienced the
conduft of the officers of the United' Stales,
From the account which these exclusive
patriots give of themselves, and of the men
cntrufted by the people, one would fuppofc
that none <sonldbemordmmaculate than they,
and none more treacherous than those offi
cers. Let us for a moment set the names ol
â¢some of the most difti'nguilhed exclusive pa
triots along fide some of thÂ« names of those
Vi|e arilYocrats,' those treacherous servants,
as they have been termed. The people in
the cpuotiy hear the, words aristocracy,
-Britilh influence, British goldâodious terms!
âbut they are sometimes at a loss to know
vtho applied to. Tell the people,
then, Mr. Fenn<i, in plain language, that
the mca whom they have entrusted for more
than twenty years past, have suddenly turn
ed traitors 1 tha,t these terms are meant to
el iminate Washington, Adams, Jay, Hamil
ton, Knox, Pickering, and men of like
character. Say to the public,that these men
r have abandoned the principles thfy efpoiifed
end advocated during out- druggie for inde
pendence ;âthat after they had grown grey
in the service of their, country, they all at
c:ice prostituted the intercfti of that country
fbr the lucre of British gold ; âthat those
vejry men, who, in 1776,br0ke and,trampled
on British chains, have, in 1796, offered
themselves to be slaves again. But when
you reaeat those charges; let it be known
whose language you have adopted. â¢ 'Tis
the language of exclusive patriots. Pray
who are these citizens that claim this pre
eminent title to virtue and patriotism ?
Who are those men who admit no ether
men's claims to public virtue and integritv ?
How many proofs gf fidelity, "attachment
and ability, have they afforded their fellow
citizens ? * I b*ve heard that their virtue is
so d'ftinguijhed, that many of their a&ions
stand recorded on the archives of France.
N Allow mc to mention the names of a few of
the most dittinguifhed patriots, such as A(Jet,
Bache, â¢ Blount, Dallas, Findley, Fauchet,
Gallatin, Genet, Giles, lieib, Livingflon,
Mifflin, M'Lean, M'Kean, Monroe', Ran
dolph, Smiley and I have men
tioned the names of Adet, Genet and Fau
chet, becaafe it has of late obtained belief
i ' *hat a Frenchman may be an American pa
, triot, and an Araeriaan a French patriot.
I shall not dare to fay any thing rcfle&injr
upon any of these gentlemen whose names 1
have mer/tioned; their merits are well known.
"Were I now speaking of Washington, or
Adams, I might fay what I pleased. They
are old servants, and acctiftomed to rough,
and what some term ungrateful, treatment.
But if I was to insinuate that one of the firft
Mentioned gentlemen, and the most zealous
exclusive patriot, was a French printer;âa
young rtan who was scarcely oiit of his lead
ing ftrj' n K s w hcji the American Cincinnatus
was fighting our battles:âthat one of them
was detested in â¦ plot for whi<;h he was ex
pelled the Senate of the United States :
that some of them fomented tht western in
-furreCtion :-*-that one oT them was cashiered
for giving occafioh to F.",uchet to fay, " thus
thifr pretended patriots have their price âI
fay, were I.to even hint any one of these
charges, it would be treason. WetÂ£ Ito
fay that one of them, in the charafter of a
minister to France, bought ruined noble
men's palaces, and wanton'd there in luxury
and wealth ; b?and caressing those
men who insulted our government, and ruin
ed b?.!f of the merchants in America, it
would be a3 much as nrty life was wortr^: â
Therefore mind, reader, I profefs that I
lay at these mea's doors no charges of this
nature. These men'are-exclufive patriots.
"What is a Washington compared with a
M'Kean ? The latter has always be?n true
to his principles. He never changed his
party in his life; âhe never 'was a violent
eonftitut;Â«nalift âthen a fedcralift, and upw
an anti-fedcralift ; âhe never was more afraid
of doing tight tf)an of going home. Would
you think of comparing Washington with
Randolph, or Adams with Blount ? Can
the names of Washington, or Adams, be
mentioned at the fame time with those of
your Burrs, your Beckleys, your Gallatins,
your Livingftons, your MifflinS, yourSnii
leys and your Swanwicks. None of these
men gamble all night, and in the morning
preach up patriotism and national grajitude
*jn the councils of our country. For instance,
what man can be more pun&ual, more honest,
ir.jfie charter more sober, more choice and
exaft hi his company, than Mifflin ? What
man ever more punctually paid his debts
than Livingfton ? He is not one of your
people who can go to jail and fettle off all
accounts with five shillings in the pound, and
then talk unblufhingly of national faith and
private Integrity.
I think Mr. Fenno, it w.mld be a good
tiling tiÂ» have noted in the dire&ories to be
found in our principal cities, against the
name of each citizen his political profeflion ;
which mioht be done with the addition of
a single lettur. Suppofc the letter Dto
iland for democrat, and the letter F for fe
dcralift: ; a man might then form not an in
accurate opinion of the relative virtue of ;
the two parties, by comparing the private 1
characters Â«f,the different partisans; Peo- ;
pie may fay what they pleafc about princj- 1
I '
ptÂ« and fc;iti:n-ntt fupportlng themfclvea
but I do not fnbfcrihe to their opinion.â
Could much edification be expe&ed from
lefttire on 'nonefiy read by a pick-pocket, c
irom an e.ffay oa sensibility written by
hangman ? There are two parties in cu
country. Tell me which of those parties ;
'â¢ cotnpofed of the greatest number of hone
men, and I will be of that psrtyr I woul
begin to examine the private chdt'a.&erj of
11 few men to whom many looked up for d
â  reftions and advice. It I found them dt
â¢- fictent m ever)' qualification neeeffary t
form honest men, I {hould be apt to fufpei
the reft of the fame party. To begi
n with thi/ firft chara&er on one fide, of th
15 (lueftion : I mean Mr. AdaaV- If I foun
<â  him honest, sober, punftual amiable in h
ilo'lhf ftic ;\s well as public character, it woul
'Â» be an argument with me of some weight i
r favor of that fide of the question. Suppol
c a governor &f the mo ft r.efpeftable state c
the Union Ihould at any time be at th
e hea'd of a political party, and I was to b
I told that he was as unamjable in his privatÂ«
e as in his public character ; that by prodi

" a bankrupt ; that lit was daily in a state c

- as much wine as we are told Alexander did
c that he paid no regard to the charters c
i those whom he admitted to his board ; thi
II his country vilta and his town house afford

To THE NjrirK jIMiKICAN.
IT is neither from the force of your ar
guments, nor a diminution on my fide of
the pleasure of confuting them, that, my
answers have been rather dilatory for some
tifie past. Circumstances of a private na
ture may ftiil continue to male our corrJpon
dence to but you IViay reft aiiured
that I will perform my promise, and that
your letters to the Chevalier d'YrujotfiH
be duly answered.
The objeft of your last, is to prove " that
the arming on the part of the Spaniards was
not merely for the purpoft;of felf-defence."
To this end you think you find in Mr.
Blount's letter the refutation of every thing
the minister has advanced in his correspon
dence ; you fay that it is absolutely itnpof
fible during the interval between the firft of
December and the 27th of February, when
the Chevalier d'YYujo the firft notice
to the Secretary of State of the intended ex
pedition, there ihould have been fufficient
time to examine and 3gree 'upon the plan to
fend the fame to Canadn, and to raifi the
forces v'-hich he supposed to have'marched
towards towards the lakes. To this I an
swer that / cannot Jelk-oe flint this project
was communicated to the Brit if !i minister the
firft of December for the firft time ; this is
an arlitrcry choice of dates, upon which it is
easy to build plausible argument;, and I
will add, there are powerful reasons to in
duce me to believe that the firft idea of this
expedition was conceived for a feng tirac
previous to the epftch 1011 have tho't proper
to select. I will not fay that the fi.n ori
1 J gloated Â»a Philadelphia.. tn the month of 1
November such an attempt was - :
a ken of at Montreal, and if the governor oP :
Canada was the author of this project, Mn
a Lifton arid his aflociates, might easily have
i' r received their imlruftions in tiirte to co-ope
rate on their pirt. An expedition of this 1
â ft nature has long been a familiar idea in that â¢
]d British po(Te!Fion. When Miranda escaped
a from the Spanifli colonies, whether from
h- fentment or vanity, he not only suggested
e- this plan to federal very refpeftable people 1
t( > in the United States, but also laid it before
ft the cabinet of St. James in England ; and 1
in it is probjble that being in-pofleflion of thele ]
data, the court of London gave orders, as ;
id soon as the war had been declared, to its a- 1
"3 j gents here and in Canada, to endeavour to 1
Id i carry the plan into effefl. From Blount's 1
in t letter, it evidently appear!! that the expedi- t
'fe 1 1 ion had beea in contemplation long before '
of ; .Chilho!m was' for while Blount 1
ie i on the one handj was of oplhion, that Chif
be, holm would return through Carolina to mix 1
among the Indians, he allures on the other, 1
li- that a person had already gone to England to t
'ft , hurry the business : this letter, with equa? 1
of evidence, that the firft design of this expedi- i
|g tion was of a long standing, as there had f
1 ; been time enough to form a plan, whence 1
of ; probably originated the movements denoun- r
it. ced by the Spanilli Minister, and afterwards f
i-; to alter it to another more vast and exten- 1
; five. The expreflirns of Blount leave ijo t
id j room to doubt of this wheo, speaking to )
0 Carey, he fays, " that the plan tv'tll be on a v
is { more extensive f ale than was at flrjl intended." t
| These circumstances prove even to demon
re j ftration, Mr. Native American, (hat the arbi- v
y | trary choice of dates, upon which you want to \
Â£ | found an argument hasÂ«not the lea ft weight, r
j and that Blount's letter, under which .you f
j. endeavour to fhclter yourfelf, of pre- v
:o fen ting to your friends me3ns of defence, h
totally cocfounds and destroys them. You f;
J j afterwards proceed to cenfnre the Spanish y
1 â  minister for his observations on the speech e
; r of a member of Cangrtfs, who, he fays, is o
r | generally jenown to be the of admin
> nid ration ; and to enforce this censure, yon f
|| bring to your afliftance, that it is consider- o
ed in England as a high breach of privilege to si
l c criminate a member of the Hcrnfe of Com- n
:. mons for what he utters in rliament ; you
likewif* fay that it it declared in the confti- d
tution of the United States, that no mem- ii
her of ekltr houfefball be quejlioned for any ei
1, fpeeeh of debate made therein any other place : tl
but thl* is to be nnderftood merely as it res- 1
a peels the refponfihility. If the members of ti
>, Parliament or Congress, have the liberty of /
speech, the public likewise have a right, if
both herein a in England, to form an opi- ft
f nion ttpon their opinions. I will agree with I
1 you, that the minj,fter of Spain has deviated tl.
n in this as to the point of form, But he has bi
e certainly been very in point of fa 3. It
To fay that Mr. William Smith was not the a
y organ of the will of administration, and that
<j thi* has not been the.meansof obtaining for
him the employment of minister to Portu-
I gal, would be the fame as to doubt of Mr. ; t
, Fox being at the head of opposition, or that
1 Mr. Ryder, Mr. Canning, Mr. Jenkinfon,
; and others, acrenta of miwiilerial will
; j in England, .
1 You insert in your letter a defence of Mr. f\
, Lifton, which is not at all to the purpose ; Â£
r but on this point I refer you to the solid and a ]
- nicll 'grounded remarks made lately by the ta
editor of the Aurora I! ! y
After having, as you thought, left the
British minister spotless, as ermirit, yon fay, q{
i that you afyftain fipm making any comments J-]
s â¢' upon the rhetorical Jlourifhes of the che- ; n
e valier .d'Yrujo's letter, refpe&ing the ltn- ( ,f
preflments of American soldiers, the cap- ; n
. ture of the French frigate La Modefte, in ft,
i the port of Genoa by the British, theic us
> having entered Trinidad with drums beat- if
ing and colours flying, of Mr? Pickering ol
" having fought in the glorious cause of A- ra
. merican independence, and of British hu
manly in the eonrfe of our war." All
these teftimonie3 you aflert are presented
1 to fedwee the minds of the ignorant ; but,
Mr. Native Amer(can, can you deny the
truth of all these assertions ? And can you on
. give the name of feduflioo to the reprefen- hr
â  tation of fafts, as notorious as they are un- at
just, and the exposition of the duplicity of th
a nation, rn whose minister Mr. Pickering I '

Remarks of the French Editor.
And thia is the last tyrant of the French!
This is the sanguinary despot whose blood
it was necelTary to spill as the price of liber
ty ! Ah ! tether fay, he was their last fa
ther : and iu hirn what a father have they
not 101 l !
Nevertheless, an impious horde daily in
sult his memory j but the homage of all
Europe and the majority of the French of
all parties revenge his manes from the_ at
tacks of the unjust and patricidal gang ; his
bjood has rebounded on their beads ; and
their countenances bear the blasting marks
of disgrace. The son of St. Louis is in
Heaven, where his pure and celestial fdul
implores of the Almighty that forgivenefs
of his enemies, which he befeeched for them
in his last prayers on earth. The monsters
(hudder with rage, when they thus percdve
us speak the language of posterity. But,
if they have had the power to tear him from ,
our luve and divide the spoils, they cannot
ravish from his manes the tribute of our tears.

NEW-YORK, September 25.
Sailed from Bermuda Sept. loth, 1797,
on board the febooner Lucy, Loudon Bai
ley, mailer, for New York; on the 14th,
at 2 P. M. was called up and told that
there was a schooner cloCe on board of us.
I had no sooner got on deck than the Jeter, j
hailed us from whence ? we answered from
St. Thomas's ; he ordered us to hoist out .
our boat immediately and come, on board 1
or that he would fire into us ; in the con- 1
fufion and having a heavy boat it wasdifÃ- ;
cult to get up tackles ; took up Come time, j
in which he hailed us several times with 1
threats for our delay; after having got â
out the boat, capt. Bailey and two hands*
weht on board ; the people were- instantly I
put ifi irons and the boat sent back with <
three of their crew, who proved to be '
Frenchmen ; they immediately took com- a
mand of the teffel, and the privateer order- *
ed them to (leer S. by W. for that night ; J,
the people who were sent on board behaved 2
with decency'towards us all that night, and Â«
the privateer kept'clofe by us. In the !
morning following sent her teat on board,
and ordered me on board with all my pa
pers ; he then ordered the people who were
on board to come with me, and left the r
crew who came on board in their room $,
on my arrival 011 board of the priva'teer, c<
was ordered into the cock-pit or the place
where the capt. kept, who received me po- _
litely and allied if I was the owner of that
(chpoiler ; I told him that I was the super
cargo of her; he then told me that Iyas a 11
gobd prize* and it was his orders to carry ''
in every vciTel to or from English ports : he.
then told me to be c and is! with hitii and tell
him what I had on board, which I did re
fpetling the cargo, and as I fpeke French 'ij
we entered into a familiar discourse, when he
told me that although I w ( ns a lawful prize,
yet he would let me go upon conditions. s
The conditions he proposed were, that he r '
Ihould have a calk of- rum, a barrel of sugar "
and a calk of w>aterâunderft'anding that I
had if viral turtle that I fhottld fend him g',
two of themâbut by begring with him*

P~ that 1 ir.ilit tike the men on board

:e not deny, although I told him J was fliort

10 j woul.l be daily meeting with 'velfels who
e_i < wop Â»' give us a supply ; I thin enquired
:o j the name of the privateer and his name,
g i which he give me in writing, certifying
in j that he had viiitcd me and put to many pri
i, , foners on board. â  The privateer's name he
called I.'Efpicgle, captain's name Le Ear
ry> from Porto Rico ; he then let me go.
on board again, and ordered his people to
J. come back, and sent the male of the {Era
is Andromache with ei;Sff men or. board, and
told us that we might go, but when I came
!, ( to examine "th; they had plundered
i- : every thing that they ccftlil % their hands
>t j upon, 200 dollars in cash, and to the amount
yj of iOo dollars *in different other articles;
e but to do the capt. justice I believe it was
i, unknown to him, for he sent me back a
is new coat whichfthey had taken, but altho'
â¢- I told his lieutenant of the loss of my mo
a ney, he told the mate of the /hip that it
I was more than his life was worth to make'
them return it, so was glad to get quit of
h themfo. Friday 15th, 'spoke the /hip Eli
1, za, capt.*Neal, from Plymouth (Eng.)
bound to Charleston, 49 days out. We
hoisted out our boat, and the mate of the
i> (hip who was on board with four hands
- went on board of her, the capt. let him have
I a hundred weight of bread and part of a
s harrel of pork in paying him all the money
s he hap, which was three fourths of a dol
t Jar; it was. very lucky for us, as we must
t have been in diftrtfs had we not got that
a ample.supply. Capt. Barry told me that
- there was a sloop and a trig cruifmg on
e the coatt from Porto Rico, and it would
1 be likely I would fall in with them, there
s .fore he had given me the certificate of hav
> in PT visited me ; he had taken three prizes,
- and said he wanted only ohe'more then he
I should return to port.
GEORGE BROWN.
S No fubje&s are more interesting in a free
- commercial country, than that of bauk
-1 ruptcy and | imprisonment for debt. The
. difficulty of framing a fyftcm of laws that
- shall do justice to creditors without fub
> jesting unfortunate debtors to wnnecefTary
' r igor, is an obstacle that has not yet been
- surmounted. But" laws for this purpose
i ought to exist, and a humane legislator can
'/ oot quietly negleft to frame them.
In a free country, it is a maxim that no
- .Tiari should be permitted to redress his own
1 Wrong*. It is the prerogative of the body
politic to punifli Why then do the tar.-s
permit imprisonment for debt ?
; This imprisonment is to be vindicate*!
1 only on one of these principlesâeither as
. the means of iecuring the person of the
. debtor, that he may riot leave, the country
, and evade the lawsâor as punifhmfent for
fraudulent con^utS âor a ccrr.pul/ion todif
. close seCreted property. In all which cases,
! wh Â« n proved, imprisonment for debt is
f doubtless juftiiinble.
But I contend," that this species of pp.
: nifhment, in the two last cases, should not
be left to the will, caprice or revengeful
, passions of the creditor. The cases of frauds
should be proved to a court of justice, and
the length of imprisonment {hould be defin
ed by lawâor fixed by the of
the court. If appears to be a great defeft
in our laws to leave it in the power of a
creditor Â»o this species of punishment
at his pleasure. Even where the debtor
r has been really guilty of unfair conduit,
the creditor ought not to pronounce his
fentenceâ:t is permitting an individual-to
exercise a right that belongs to the legisla
ture, and giving very improper latitude ta
human paflions and frailty.
But when the debtor has not been guilty
of frauds or unfair dealings, it is not only
hard, but extremely unjust, that he Ihouhl
be in the power of a mercdefs creditor.
The law should never p â¢irrit one man to
give another undeserved pain, or to deprive
Jiis family and his country of his services. *
The inuocent {hould be legally diftin
gll ifiled from the guilty. The puuiflmient
oi the guilty {hould be defined and limired
by law, and the innocent {hould not fnffer
at all. These things are not well ordered
in our country. The laws are deficient
and ought to be amended. [Minerva.']

THE FRIGATE CONSTITUTION.
On Wednesday lart", accDrdiirg' to prcvi-
CU3_ notice, the frigate Coxfttution was to
have been launched into her destined ele
-1 ment, of which the will be a considerable
ornament. Early in the morning, the' in
habitants of every description proceeded to
the navy yard, houfrs in the vicinity, or 1
on "board veflels moored a short difiance '
from the shore, tg view a scene, which, as
Americans, hnd excited their warmed infe
reft. The launch of a frigate fuperlor in i
elegance of architecture, neitnefs of work- t
manfhip, and flrength of material, to any s
' "6vher ever built in the worldâwhich waa r
entirely American ânecefTarily produced in t
the breafl of every one who deserves to en- (
Joy the privileges of eit/'zenfhip in our c
country j the liveliest emotions of felicita
tion, and a fond belief that the Columbian ' n
navy will one day be able to cope with
those nautical plunderers, who are almofl
gorged with American booty ; and mortify
those miserable wretches who attempt by ' n
their clumsy ridicule to damp an arflor j "
\Â»hich honors ou* country, and deflroy in I
embryo the very engine which we now nefd j t
for our prote&ion. Among the refpeCta- j
tie fpeftators on this occasion, was the j.
chief magiflrate of the United States, and
the governor and It. governor of this com
monwealth. However those jacobin Tcrib
blers who afFeft attachment to the govern,
ment, and deference to the people of th< P'
United States, msy pretend to confiftcncy, a l
their cotiflant efforts to bring into disrepute 0'
the bulwark of our liberties, and their con.*
tinual abuse of the people in their ffpre- .
fsntativesâconvict them of abfurdfty and ,n
almofl of treason. Â» ta
'Tlie pleasing fpc&acle of the colleded f"
beauty and flrength of our counrry, was a
degree of compensation for the mortifioati- tc
on, which the refpi'te given by Fate to the ,
launching c,f the frigate occasioned. , c
At the inflant the .tide had ruu to its Ul
height, al] the block's were clear, the shores
removed, and the frigate refled 011 her bilge
ways, which supported her in the utmost *
security, neither fpreadinj nor fettlino- ; Â°! 1
but for want of fufficient declivity in.the
cradle r -fhe did Rot move towards the sea.
The prudence of the conllrutlor pro- ex
duced this trifling delay in her dehut into ev
the ocfan, but the circumflance does not /
reflect the least discredit on him. After
â¢ preparing a feyv tackles, several screws, &c.
. and cutting away some of the bilge-ways,
with considerable exertions the was moved â 
20 feet, when (he ceased ber motion ; and a c
- the tide having ebbed considerably, it was
conceived proper to defer any further efforts e:
t6 git her into the water till Friday, [this I ent
day] though it is not doubted but similar cvt
exertions to those which firfl flarted her,' ar Ã
would Jiave.completed her launch, had not ,^r '
prudence prevented the renewal of them.

he is off!â but what was bitterest of all, i
s tnat the money also was gone off with him !
3 Ihi thief was an " exclusive patriot," \
_ and an inveterate and incorrigible democrat. (
t The above new instance (which is founded: 6
