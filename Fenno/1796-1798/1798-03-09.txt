FOREIGN INTERCOURSE. pla<
(hoi
WFDHESDAY FSBRWARY 28. t J, e .
Mr. Macon had no doubts as to thecwn- r y j
ftitutionality of the present queftton. Ihe and
fame claul'e of the constitution whicn gave
the President power to appoint judges, gave f cre
him the power to appoint foreign mini Iters; < j rf(
and he be'ieved he had the fanae right to fay faÃ<
to what place a minister should be lent, that re f o
he had to fay where a court should be held. ?
It had been observed Mr. M- said, that
there was a party in that house w-*o willed j
to infringe andproftrate theExccutirerig ts;
but it had been clearly (hewn that there had
never been such an attempt made. â 
The time was said tobe improper for mak
ing the proposed regulation; it appeared ,c_,
him expressly contrary. From the 4th or
July 1776, all the foreign ministers who had r
been in this country had done more harm
than ours had done good in foreign conntries.
As early aÂ» theyear 1785, the inconvenience
had been felt. But it was said to be a mat
ter of politeness, and if foreign governments
sent ministers here, we mud also fend mimf
ters to them. He wished to get clear of â¢ r '
this business; but he believed we had lent
ministers to countries from whence none had
been returned, so that that rule was not a
general one.
It had been said, speeches were made wa
from one fide Â«f the house to tht galleries. P
He believed that both fides had done'the u ' c
fame, for gentlemen allowed they did not
expedt to make converts in that house, and
therefore thsy mnft have spoken to the pub
li- ' ''
A fubjeft had been introduced which he
thought ought not to have been mentioned "
in that house, he meant the conduÂ£\ which co
it was [aid the Pjefident had adopted of ap- 1 " a
pointing to office pcifons of one opinion on
ly. This might be attended with great in- 1
convenience. Suppose the President and \
Vice-President were, at , any time of differ- 31
ent political opinions, if the former were to r<
die, the latter, if this system was to be aft- S r
ed upon, mud turn out all persons in office, jy*
which would certainly appear an exiraordi.
nary measure.
It was said the gentleman from Virginia, Â° r
and those who supported the amendment,
wished to violate the constitution and over- wl
threw the government. This charge was P '
principally made again ft members of the a '
southern Sates, than in which he would ven- to
ture to fay, the laws of the United States PÂ°
had no where been better executed; forth*'
their members in that house had generally ls
been a minority, no instance of opposition
to the laws had ever occurred, and in cafe *Â°
of a diffolatioa of the government, they **'
would certainly have nothing to gain, but .
would molt probably, in any convulsion* be Â°*
the greatest losers. Why, then, were these 'J 1
arguments brought here ? Was it to impress '
it upon tbe minds of citizens of other parts
of tbÂ»Hni>rdÂ£ratÂ»Â». thÂ»t thÂ»v fo"<L S
"oF government; that they wiflied to live in
disorder ? There was no truth to lupport P Â£
the charge Some gentlemen had charged r 5
them with wishing to stop the wheels of gov
ernment, whilst others had spoken of them,
as wilhing to add a fifth wheel to,it, so that Â®
one supposed them to stop its course, and
the other to make its movements too rapid.
They had nothing which looked like disor
ganization in their part of the country. E- 11
ven their newspapers vverefilent on that head; 111
he wilhed he could fay as much for papers
in another part of the Union. It was clear, C(
if any part of the country had a right to P
complain, it would be the southern dates, v
as many of the laws bore hardly upon 11
them, and none of them afforded them any c:
, advantage. n
But it was observed, that if our foreign rl
ministers were done away, we should have 0
' secret spies. He believed we had now not ei
only public but secret spies. It was not
, long since they had a report before them f
which (hewed that we had had a secret spy j 1
in a public minister, who had engaged in a 11
â¢ plan which might have involved this country F
I in a war, had it not been timely discovered.
He hoped, however, every department of 1
government had exerted themselves to devel- v
ope this mysterious business.
It was said, that it was probable this mo- '
tion had its origin in a disappointment which c
gentlemen felt in the election of President. '
He did not believe that this'had had any t
" ; effect, and during, the late Presidency, an <
' attempt was made to retrench the peefent ex- *
- penditure.' As well might he lay that what | c
e '"bad fallen from the gentleman from Connec- i '
j ticut (Mr. Goodrich) was intended to ia- ]
- jure the Vice-Prcfitlmt. '
j Mr. M. would not boast of what the
'â > southern states had done; but lie would fay 1
' what they had not done; the* had not been '
the promoters of banks, funding and excifc 1
fyflerrs, Jiamp' ads, &c.
Mr. M. said, he thought aa observation 1
made by the gentleman from Mew-York,
yesterday, went wholly againtt his own doc
trine, viz. that appointments to office made
ten enemies to one friend. He believed the
csntrary was the 'truth, and that the Gov
ernor of the state of New-York had remain
ed a long time in office principally from the
support which that patronage gave him.-w
*> The fame gentleman was equally unfortunate
' in his reference to the amendment proposed
by the legislature of Virginia to the consi
st tut ion, as the words of that amendment
1 were that the House of Representatives have
Â°* ' and ought to have the power in queftionfMr.
Williams said he alluded to the amendmei t
~ proposed two years ago which was different
ly exprefled.J
Mr. M. did not know what gentlemen
meant when they spoke of the usurpations
of that House over the other branches of
the government, such a remark could only
3 t be intended to impose upon the people out
)r of dcors.
:f Mr. M. said, tbe queilioa was a simple |
* Â«ne. It was whether that House Would wct<
undertake to regulate the salaries of Foreign houi
ministers. The right of doing this could then
not be doubted ; fÂ»r though he did not be- to b<
lieve the House had a right tÂ» fay to what / cede
places ministers ftould be sent, a:id what .j But
fliould be their grade, he did belieÂ»e that < his t
they had a right to fay, that so much fala- j a hu
" ry fliould be given to ministers at one place the j
e and so much at another ; and-this was pro- lowi
e per, since the different style ofJliying in dif- quef
e ferent places made four thousand five hun- coul
' dred dollars at one court, equal to nine thou- at la
y sand at another. H f hoped, therefore, the of h
c resolution would bd adopted. csmi
I Mr. Thatchzr agreed with tbe gentle
j man just fat dowiÂ£" that much unncctffary
matter had been iiitpoduced into the present
j' debate. He betteved it rauil have struck e- eye l
very one, that most of the topics which had
been discussed related little to the bill itfelf-
He was of opinion that the mover himfelf I . ou .
,f of the amendment, thought it of little im- n
j portance; because the law would expire at morc
n the end of two years, and he had frequent
-5 ly said he did not wifti hi 3 proposed regula- V.
'J tion to take immediate effed, so that the ' tu
' time betwixt the laws Uking effeft. and its
s expiration, could not make the law of much ' 1
j- consequence. The gentleman had, there- Â£ er . ta
fore, considered this amtndment merely as , xln;
' an oocaCon to reprehend whatever he diflik- . 1X
j ed. Mr. Thatcher said, he should make a oe P'
a few observations upon wlat the gentleman a ne '
had declared he had in view in bringing for- ,
| c ward the amendment, vj*. to bring the di-' 1 '
s plomatic eftablilhment tÂ» what it was from | er Â®
the year 1790 to 1796, wlien it was depart- end
)t ed from, and to preven: an hicreafe of our a '
1( j Foreign ministers. e
Mr. Thatcher advtrted to the law of . â 
1790, of which he said that tlÂ»e present bill
i ie was nearly a tranfeript ; that there was no- cQnt
â¢d t '" n Â» ,n t ' l,s to ?' ter , ' ,e f* sre 'g n inter-
courfe tftablilhment (if it were dsf-r-ing tK<,
__ name yf an eftablifbment); for if a larger w
sum of tf.onef was gVanted for the War or
n _ Treifurj Department in one year than had n
n( j been grinted in another, it would not be j an
, r _ said that the eftablilhments were departed *g' a
t0 from. n 1794 . a million of dollars were (a [ l(
granted for foreign intercourse; but this j nM
" e was no departure from the diplomatic eftat- erb
lifhment. Ib 1786, other sums were grant- t j #n
ed, hut mne of these grants either added to
; a< or diminifted from the power of the Prefi- qu (
(t * dent. Tie only feature in the law of 179p t
which cou'd conflitute any thing like a di- j
aJ plomatic efablifkmer.t, was the fixing of the

[ f a y upon any one instance, to have supported b
been h' s portion. Mr. T. then took a vrtw of ai
â¢xcfe 'I I6 manner in which Athens and Rome had n
fallen. The overthrow of the latter, he
ition said, had been aceomplifhed by mobs (some- ft
ork, thing of which h?d been seen in this coun- tl

tain- of the downfall of Greece, and added that t
II the there were things in this country which 0
much resemble the situation of that, and if F
mate a flop was not put to them, we should soon
>ofcd experience a similar fate. Nothing was v
mfti- more easy than to assert that liberty had al- c
ment ways Veen deftro.yed by au excess of power t
have in the executives of governments; but he {
believed it had more frequently been'de- t
met t ftroyed by Democratic Afobs, by the eredion c
rent- of Whifley Poles and Liberty Poles ; and by i
i discontented representatives going home to (

the people of the tJnitcd States will slot al

In some cases, he fais, the ho.ufc was>Â»
more at liberty to refufe to appropriate than
a man was at liberty to commit a criine.
Wherever an office was created by the cÂ»nÂ»
futution, or bylaw, the house was not at
liberty to refufe an adequate compenfatiott
to the persons who filled thufe office*. Trt
certain cases, the house might repeal a law
fixing salaries, or far appointing officflf }
but whilst the law e sifted, these officer* must
be paid. Mr. T illustrated his petition bjf
a nember of indances.
If it was the opinion of the PrefMcflt,
therefore, that it was proper to have minis
ters in every court in Europe, he ought t*
fend them, and the hoWfe could not refufit
to appropriate for their falariet. ft Would
be ufxrpatian to do so
It was only necessary to notiee ooe ffiort
fen{enÂ« of the gentleman from Virginia,
to (hew that if that house had the poWr of
controlling the appointment to office," the
f.TTTtr
it would accommodate any gentleman, he
had no objeftion to making provision for *
| mini Iter plenipotentiary to Spain." Thit
j language was, " You want a minister in
Spain ; if you that the house
take the powor of regulating this bufinefe
into its own hands, 1 will agree to & minist
er being sent there." So that another gen
tleman might a(k for another some where
' else, and so on, which would be granted
~ on certain conditions. Every one must fee
' to what this would lead.
But it had been said, that our public a
* gents were mostly taken from the legislature,
3 and that the drafts from thence had been a
larming. What, he a iked, was the fatt ?
e At London we have had three minifter6,
' two of whom were never in the legislature |
in France fire, one of whom had only bee*
â  ; a legislative character, and he did notcorne
r " ! within the view of â¢ ,,B w ' lo
' mad- - " â TnÃoy becaafe he was opposed
H ; to the views of the executive ; at the Hague
1 we have had only Mr, Adams, who was lie*
ver in the legislature, and now Mr. Murray,
who,' he believ d, was appointed about three
, days before his time in congress expired,
1 but who had three months before fignifiei
his intention of declining any farther fer
e* vice in coDgrefs ;we have had two rriinitlert
rc ia Spain, neither of whom were takep from

1 whom had been in the Jegiflaiure j and ont
Kat Berlin, which is Mr. Adams. So thai
| out of fifteen miniders, only four had been
' legislative charafters ; one of whom did not
a * come within the description alluded to, an 4
te another was .appointed within a day or twÂ»

not think this a very alarming view ; and

V THURSDAY MARCH I,
us .
,f e Mr. T. Claisoknk, after some apology
ir . fordoing fo,proceeded to read some obferva
â s. tions on the quedion before the committee*
he He firft dated, that considering that the
of present appropriation was demanded,*as a
ltK matter of right -by the executive, to allow
ip. of which would be giving him an uncondi
tional control over the legislature, he could
not consent to it.
Conceiving did that the houff had
a conditutional right to make appropriate
,if. ons, and separated as we were fram Eur?- .
lat pean nations, and having fufficient . fourcet
Â»x- of happiness within ourselves, he was in fa
'he vour of the present amendment which went
md to curtail our foreign intercourse. He be
ne ]i e ved the less diplomatic intercourse w.e had
lx- the better, and that it was our interest to
on- cultivate peice nnd harmony amongst our-
Led selves, and with all the world,
alt If the doarines now contended for were
w to prevail, there would be no power iÂ« this
rrer house over the purse of the nation ;it would
ted be merely the means of colltfling taxes,
of and could not refufe any appropriation of
la d money which the Executive might call far.
be After examining the constitution, and
Tie- (hewing that this dofirine had no support
un- there he took notice of some lnterrogato
de- ries which had been put by * ffentleman
;m , frem Connefticiit (Mr. Goodrich). What,
o/s, said he, exclaimed that gentleman, have;
ilfo these dijergtlnixers dpne ? Mr. C. in answer
hat to this question, went into an enumeration
ich of the ftrvices which the southern dates had
[ if performed (particularly what the (late of
oon Virginia had done) in the courfr of tile re
was volutionary wtr", in order to procikre' thiÂ»
1 al- oonditution ; and then took notice of what
wer they had done and were dill doing in fup<
he port of it. They submitted he said, to all
de- the regulationt under it, particularly to e&
Hon cife and Jl amp-laws, which were very obnoÂ»
Iby ious to republicangovernments, nor did
eto complain of the impod duties, though ther
nnd bore hard upon them. Wh-n an iniurreftJ
on took place Jn the date of Pennfylvanil,
iwer they were the firft to march to quell it.-Â»-
'ed ; No rebellious person had ever dared to she*
they his headin his dtforgamz.>ngJlate. They h"l
:felf. been much injured in the settlement ot thtir
dent accounts far supplies furnilhed during <nc' war, in fomrcafo Sot sompirt
fated For oÂ»< hundredth'part of ;hi injuries
Vb'ic'h had been doue, and in some not Â«
, tbcufandth part.
Mr. C; would Â»flf, ih his turn, what those
, ' frlcndt of order, theXnfteTÃ States, had done
" infupport of th* Constitution ? They had,
'* hÂ« knew, been the meant of procuring for
tfe country a Britift* Treaty, which was
' likely to involve uÂ» in war, and they were
"now endeavouring to make all the branches
Â«f government dependent upon the execu
-Ir"tiVe. H* did not thank them for fUth
support.
- As'to whit had been said about addrcfiing
tbs galleries, and the people out of doors,
be believed it was perfeftly right that the
people ftrohhi be well informed of what they,
their representatives, were doing, except
tbey were to be lookedupon as a ftnfelejs
* herd, of whom it was not necessary to take
iny notice. He wished there were no mo
-1 rives in the house left pure than these. For
* his part,' be refpeSed the fovefeighty of the
people, and wilhtd to remain no longer in
_ tbat house than whilst he spoke their sense.
The gentleman from Connecticut had spo
ken in high terms, of the late President.
He hid hipfelf an high opinion of that
gentleman, and so had his constituents. It
waSt-ue, they disapproved Â».f some things
' that he had done, and were sorry that he
V hid doÂ»e"tHeUS. As to the gentleman who
now fills the presidential Â«hair, be viewed
" him as a great arid good man ; but he be
' lieved all men to be fallible. When he did
things which ought, in his opinion, to be
; approved, he fn6uld approve them ; and
when he aft<d c'ontrarily, he ihonld con
demn them. He believed that, in his state
there were neither prejudices agai aft, nor
in favour, of either the late or the present
President.
Bat the gentleman frpm Connefticct, to
â¢nnrui ne ii3<r ainjÃcu, TKjs
was a pleating word ; but it appeared to
him as if some gentlemen wished rather to
(hake the union to its centre. His own
mind, however, acquitted him of any thing
that Ivad net ia view the good of the people.
He wished to preserve the harmony of the
union ; he would hazard every thing to
preserve itâbecause he believed " that h
â¢, sited we (land, but divided we fall."
If gentlemen would withhold their ill
natured sarcasms, members might unite to
do the business of the union for which they
were sent. He adtrtonifhed them to talk no
more of faclkus diforganizert, ft tile minori
ties, democratic clubs, &c. if they wished
for union and concordâbut that they did
â¢wish this, with him was doubtful. If they
do not, however, said he, let them speak
â¢ut, and then they will be underllood.
Such charges,every one knew were unfound
ed, and being so, tbeyjcould not be expect
ed to y.Â« with temper. No rebellious
kead had ever Been p o
towmac. If a rebellious rascal was to n t .
pear there, he would not be fuffered to live.
He knew this to be the cafe in the quarter
he had mentioned, and he believed the fame
rtight be said of the ftatet of Maryland and
Delaware ; and though the people of the
soUthern states bad' been loaded with all the
foul epithets which could be imagined, he
believed they would be found the props of
the constitution. For his own part, he
would facrifice his life to preserve it.

The bill to continue in force for a limi

Mr. D. Foster, from the committee tff 1

petition of Frederick W. Eldridge, who I
fought compensation for the services of his I
father as a soldier, which was Concurred

Mr. Elmend'orf presented the petition of |
Will iatri Thome, praying compensation for I

Mr. Milledge presented a petition from I
the Commissioners of Pilotage of Georgia, I
dating that great murmurs and complaints I
are made by the matters of veflels, on ac- I
count ot the want Â©f a Beacon and Buoys I
at the entrance of the Savannah river, and I
praying that luchÃeacon and Buoys may be I
erefted.âReferred to ths committee of I
commerce and manufactures.
Mr. Matthews obtained leave of absence I
for ten days. I,
Mr. Dennis moved that the committee of 11

alter the manner of making entries of Still? I
be discharged from a further confederation I <
oftheftibjeft, and that the following Refo- Jl
lution be referred to the committee of ways I i
and means. I j
'5 Resolved, that the committee of ways I |
and means be inftrufted to report a bill al- I 1
tering the time of entering Stills from the I
nionth of June to the months of August and I
oeptemher." It
Mr. D. said his reasons for making this I 1
motion were these. He found the Secreta- (
f? of the Treasury had objeftions to the do- e
irig away the annual entry of Stills, as he | e
looked upon this regulation as eflential to r
the security of the colleftion of the revenue, I d
and to a due control of Colleftors. Mr. D. (
found the committee of ways and means had IP
differed in opinion from the Secretary of the
Treasury, and had reported a bill, which P
had been found to contain proviiions more I f<
â¢ objtftionable than the annual entry. As C(
hÂ« believed it would be impoflible to do a- 0
V.-3J the annual entry, he wished to make t(
such alterations in it, as should make itlefc d
objefticnabie. He believed this would be t!
tffefted by altering the time of making the
entry in the mariner proposed bytherefolu- c:
tion which he had offered to the house, as 31
in those months distillers had occasion to jpi
take cut their licences, and they could make I m
V. Â£ !tr y required at the fame time.

ie no plan for :b ing the annual entry
I, could be adopted, without introducing re
ir gulatious which would be more inconveni

e would be proper, therefore, to enquire whe
â s ther a different period might not be adopted
i- which would be more convenient to diftil

of the Treasury was of*opinion that a differ

to cloath and maintain their armies out of
neotral powers. France knows that neu
tral nations will have the mannfa&ures of
Great Britain, and that (he herfelf cannot
cloath her armies without them. She has
lately been obliged to.pafs-a law, admitting
a certain quantity of British manufaÂ£tures
to be purchased to cloath her armies. But
she is na longer able to pay for them, and
therefore will take thtm wherever (lie can
find them, i-.1l the effeft the late law can
poflibiy have, ur/H ( 1e th-at neutral nations
111 Head of paying f or their own supplies
barely, will now have to add to the amount
the supplies foi France. It cannot mate
rially injure Great Britain. If it could, the
friends of France might' have some apolo
gy, for approbating the measure. It is a
iyftcm of warfare upon neutral nations;
unattended with th<- fiimfey palliation of
lome such fyfiems, that thereby their ene- j
mics are materially injured.

of the Captors, the captaia and crew hav
ing returned to America.
The situation of the unfortunate Ameri
cans that are carried into Porto-Rico de
mands attention. From an unaccountable
policy of the Spanilh government of the Isl
and, all neutrals or strangers are prohibited
from entering the City, until special per
mifiion is obtained from the Governor.
The Privateerfmen avail themselves of this
circumstance to detain the captains on board
and prevent their having intercourse with a
Â»y person that might give them ufeful infor
mation, until they effed fending their pa
pers down -to St. Domingo where the court
of Admirality'iVeftaWifhed, and when the
condemnations are revived, the captains
and what part of the crew may be on board
are turned on fliore, without the means of
lubfiuing and are liable from the aforefaid
policy of the Spauilh Government to be
imprisoned, and what adds to the unfortu
nate predicaments, opportunities for the
people to return to America occur but rare-,
ly, as all neutral vcfTels, except under par
ticular circumstances are prohibiting from
entering the port. ,
The brig Maria and a schooner Maria, I
that faded from Port* RiWthc fame day,
have afforded >n opportunity Â£br "those ;o

St. JOHN's, (Amigu,;) January 23.
1 ; A furious quarrel, we underttaud, lately
took place between fjmf American gentle
men and Frenchmen, in St. Bartholomew*?,
in consequence of an American v< hav
ing been takeri from under the fort ih?re, by
â  a French privateer, and that four of the lat
> ter were killed.
On Saturday the 13th i'nfl. at
English 'Harbour, Charles Peteifon, Efq,
fir ft lieutenant of bis Mtjefty',? ship Perdrix.
We did not notice the death of this gentle
men in our lad papers, from a wish to pro
cure the best information in oarpowercjf the
real cause of this event, which was' occafi
' oned by an unfortunate dispute between
the deceased and Lord Camelford, upon the
right of commanding at English Harbour.
Lord' Camelford, as w,e are informed,
commanded his majefty'* sloop of war, thit
Favourite, by virtue of an order or warrant
from admiral Harvey, and Mr. Peterfon,
although an older lieutenant than lord Ca
melford, had lately served on board that
ship under his command : but having, been
removed t* the Perdrix, and lord Camel
ford not haring a com miflion as master and
commander, being then at English harbour,
supposed himfelf to be the commanding of.
ficc ' 5 atW under that idea, ifTued some or
ders to lard Camelford, which were an
fwcred by other ordert from lord Camelford
to Mr. P. terfon.
Upon Mr Peterfon'srcfufal to obey thefc
orders, a lieutenant with a party of msrines
were sent to put him arrest, and Mr. Peter
fon prepared f, r refinance, ordering the
crew of the Perdrix to am in hi* defence,
but before uiy conflidt rook place, lord Ca
melford arrived, went up to Mr Pettrfon
demiiuVd if lit woulj obey his orders or
not, and upon helng arifwered in
tinc, immediately fliot him dead upon the
spot.
An inquetl was taken by the coroner on
the next day ; but the juiy not being wil
ling.to take upon theiÃfelves the determina
tion of the quetion upon wjiom the Com
mands English harbour haddeyolved,found
only that the deceased had been (hot by Jord
Camelford, in coniequepee of a mutiny.
It is much to be lamented that the right '
of commanding in the marine service, Ihould
not have been as well afcettained, nor at
least as generally known, as it is in the ar
my. If Lord Camelford was really the
commanding officer, his conduit, we un
derhand, is juftifiable in point of law ; but
if the command during the absence of anr
poâ captain, or.master and commander, had
devolved upon Mr. Pfterfoit, lord Camel
ford will of conrfe he liable to be tried for
the crime |of mntiny, by a court-martial,
where the privilege of his peerage cannot
\ va,i J ! 11 â¢ 5 and there c,n no doubt but
that ftrjdt jultiee will be done.

AT a junfkire when the question of

becomes extremely uiefut to those eitixens of the

forntfhed with the necessary data, to judge of the

I hi* work is principally distinguished by the
cichncfrof the observations, the pcrfpisuity of th#

contains. At Vars, a man of wit obfsrved, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up

refpeds different at die present day, from what

were"written, yet it may be justly fcid.that so ma
nj *bfÂ«lute and permanent data still remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
Ids on that account j on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the rt

tional premium will be ret ired, in proportion to
eircuraftarces.
11. Insurance. will also be made on buildings and
good 3 extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to tha risque. But it is not easy to arrange these
under particular heads or classes, so as to describe
each with the necessary accuracy. Each cafÂ» mud
therefore be decided upon according to the circutn
ftaaccs attending it ; and these circumstances wili,
in general, appear from the description accompa

Buildings partly conflruiSed of brick or stone,
are preferable, to thofc wholly wooden. And in
both cafe*, the ftila of building, how they are oc
cupied, how they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how occupied, are considerations to

2d. Insurance* may be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
ptnfeÂ« than the payment of the premium of the re
newed term, the circumstances continuing the fame
as they were nnderftood by the Infurrrs at the time
the former insurance waÂ»
of the premium is eflential to such renewal ; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; nor can the insurance be renew
ed sn the former policy but by computing the
commencement of the renewal from the expiration
of the former insurance. The fubjt& of insur
ance may neverthslefs be open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. If any other insurance be made on the fame
property ; it mod be made known at the time of
