a committeefwith me, to enquire into the state of '
new arts and manufactures, which have been intro- I
duced in the fouthetn counties, 1 have prefuined a- J ,
lone to exhibit the following account as the belt, *
which time and my opportunity for enquiry would 0
allow. ''
Sitice. the American revolution, there has been
in this part Â«f the country, not only a vety great T
increase of fotmer manufactures, but several new f !
ones have sprung up. Within the counties of I
Plymouth and Bristol, there are now in operation, ,e
14 blaft,-and si air furnaces; 20 forges, 7 Piitjcgf 'â¢
and rolling-mills, besides a large number of trip
hammer (hops, and an almost incredible number of
nail shops and^others, for common fmithery. These 3r
furnaces annually produce, from 15 to 1800 tons ec
,â¢ 0 f iron ware.âThe forges, on an average, manu rc
faCturemorC than 1000 tons annually, and the flit- ' S|
ting and rolling mills, at left tons. The rol- J
ling and Hitting of iron*nay well be considered as 0
one of our new manufactures. There was indeed, ln
â upwards of 40 years ago, & flitting mill erected in
Milton, and another in Middleborough, but when â
compared with those of modern improvement, they a '
were imperfeCt and unproductive *. This how- VVI
ever, did not fail to excite the jealousy of Britain, OI _
and her Parliament soon interdicted this tnanufae-, *
turein America. After this, the firft mill'of the ,
kind we hear of, was built in Taunton in 1776 ; 11
this for a confiderab'.e time stood alone in New-
EÂ»giand ; ;nd was then the best ever built in Ame
rica" ln thenar 1780, another was ereCted in
Blidgewatei, and soon after another in Kingston. I ? e
In the year 1787, the second, and in 179 1, the la(
third was built in Taumoa. Three others were ot
ereCted near together in the year 1793, viz. one an
at Stoughton, one at Plymouth, and'the second in a "
Btidgew iter. These are all I have heatd o.f with
in the limits of and except our, :al
they are all within the limits of the two counties f. a 8
The various manufactures of these mills, have gi- I a I
yea rife to many other branches of manufactures
lpt
us. I . r
From the annual production of three flitting and m
rolling million Taunton,which is not less than 800
tonsof iron,more than one half is again manufaCtur
ed into hammered and cut nails, spades and (hovels J
within that town, /. about 50 tons are cut, 330 w "
are hammered into nails, the remainder is wrought | " at
into spades and shovels. In the town of Norton,
the annual amount of the nail manufacture, is not
less than 300 tons. In Attleborough, too; in 5
-Raynham, upwards of 60, and in less quantities I
in fetrrtal other towns in the fame county. The j
town of Bridgwater ftaiids next to Taunton in this my
manufacture, and the firft in-all others, except mill aid
saws, which affe made of fuptrior quality in East- j thi
town. Although number of rods hap
cut in these mills are annually exported, yet an e- P
qnal number at least, are importedâso that the full
amount of all the rods cut fli these mills are manu
factured into nails within the limits of the old co- I ~
lurty of Plymouth. This manufacture was not an I
objeCt of any considerable attention until about the I
year 178;, when the general court laid a duty up- j
on imported nails of every size. This gave finewi do
to the aim, and motion to the hammer, which soon free
terminated in the complete eftabliftiment of the bee
nail manufacture. From 4or 500 nails indifferent, lun
Jy made by one hand,, in oÂ»e day, more than 1000 as v
are now well.made in the fame time. The iron ala
(hovel manufacture began at Bridgwater, in about (hal
the year 1785. The moulds were then wrought laH (
under hammers. But in 1788, they pSffed thro' of (
the roiling mill. This improved method was owing of 1
to the ingenuity and enterprise of Samuel Leonard, Nol
Efq of Taunton. He rolled firft (hovel ever I ted
done in America. Since that time, the number as c
annually made in Taunton, has not been less than dill
100 doic-en, and more than twice that nnmber in IVh
Bridgwater. This expeditious method of rolling j ling
the patterns hÂ»s reduced the price nearly to one not
half. Wire drawing, anxl rolling (heet iron for*he I ltd
tin manufacture, has been futvefsfully praCkifed in j Gei
one of the mills in Taunton, but the latter is now leall
an objeCt of more p art icilar attention at the rolling Lure
mill in Plymouth. The art of calling canaon, thÂ«
cannon balls, &c. in air furnaces, ought to be rank- kinj
ed amontr the new and of our diflridl ellii
The firft furnace of this kind was built in Bridg- Exc
water soon after the commencement of the war; Fra
and when we eonlider the exnence of heating a poii
blast furnace to a ftlfficient degree for melting iron, Th<
and compare it to thnt of au air furnace, the fupe- 4,6,

ed to Europe. The fuperintendant,, as well as
, 0 f j some of the principal workmen, now in thi armou
ry at Springfield, were original manufacturers from
p o i_ I Bridgwater. The art of making (teel was intro
j duced in Eaftown, by Capt. Eliphalet Leonard, in
1 786 : It has, lince that time, been made there in
p j very considerable quantities, and much cheaper

below it.
he , T he manufacture of cut nails began soon after 1
j the revolution. Tht machine which gave it birth,
I was the invention of Mr. Ezekiel Reed, of Ab
ual ington. Near the fame time, and by the fume in-
I genious mechanic, was wade a wool t-id maihifteâ
â¢gn I this gave rife to that manufacture among us. But
r who was the original inventor of that ufeful inftru
me ment, by which cotton and wool cards are now
I made cheaper and better in America than in any
re- I P art Europe, 1 (hall not determine. It is,
ite I ''Â°wever, allowed to be an American invention.
>c t I The manufacture of linseed oil. fir (I began in
Eaftown, in 1792, and from an annual stock of
e( j about 3000 Bulhels of feed, there has been annually
I produced near 5000 gallons of oil. There is an
I oil mill fn Plymouth, and another in Bridgenater.
as- I manu^a C^ ur c of (lone ware, of hand fellows,
as I n e,t ' e buttons, iias lately been introduced in
0 f I the county of Bristol, in all which the pivfent prof
_ I peil promises future success. In the towns of
a- ['Norton and Taunton, there is.a manufacture of a

Id I o^a dark yellow colour. This originated in Nor

WHEN particular and interesting occurrences ' n i

1 free rang* among writers upon subjeCts which have
been thought ufeful and inftruaive, and which aie in

a late Noble Emigrant, may be acceptable. We
shall give the statements in the translation. "In he!

as connected with riches. The Dutch indeed, and
