queiice of the late calamity,
To the binevolent donors who came for
ward to five relief to our fuffering fellow
citizens at cne of those trying pariods which
d'eldom happen in any country.
It is to youthat we conceive it our duty
to address at this time ; not only because it
belongs to you to be acquainted with the
appropriation of your money that wa3 cn
trr.fted to us as your agents, but likewile
to give vent to feelings of gratitude that are
engraven on our minds, for the generous
a ail fpoiitaneous fupplics depoutfd in our
hfinds, at a moment when our thoughts were
ifeepVy" engaged to find out ways and means
t > afford relief to about fix thoufnnd diftreff
td rr.en, women and children, who had be
iJOEe obiscb of our c?re, in confequt'nce of
having received fnppoit from the fuin grant
ed by the Legidature, which was <#'.tirely
ospemlcd by th,' eighth of October : At
' t'liii junftuvt we called on our fellow-citi
2Â»r, , "> id were anfwercd with'that noble
â¢ â¢ I
n'ffo of/pi,it which characterizes our coun
try, by receiving in ca(h upwards of twenty
thnufand ive hundred dollars, exclusive of
three hundred and thirty five barrels, and
sixty hundred,. three quarters and fifteen
Tjounds in bags of wheat, rye, buckwheat,
and indian meal ; besides potatoes and fun
i!ry other kinds of provifiou : aided by the
above, and affiited by a number of refpec!-
table inhabitants of the city, northern liber
ties, and Skiuthwark ; we are erfabled so
continue relieving, by weekly donations, a
bove thirteen hundred persons, chiefly heads
(if families, oppressed by poverty (icknefs
and distress, and to give employment to a
bout fix hundred men on the roads ; who if
not provided for in that manner would, in i
a all probability, huve been, from dire necedi- ;
ty, compelled to descend tp means injurious '
to themselves and to the community.
Thus have we endeavoured to explain to j
you, in some measure, in what manner we
expen&dyour money, entrusted to us until'
about the 18 th in ft. at which time an exam
ination of our funds took place, and the bal
ance found ta be but two thousand dollars-
Artec making appropriations for the pur
chase of five hundred cordis of wood, and
fifteen hundred bufhtls of potatoes, for the
purpoie of meeting the diftrefiesof the poor
in the more inclement season. '
At this time we were called on by an af
iofctation of young women of great refpetfla- '
bility afid known philanthrophy, who have ]
been for ftveral winters employed in relief- 'â¢
ing without pa. tiality the fuffering posr par- t
ticiikrly of theii own sex ; paying no re- ;
gard to distance weather or fituution ; not 1
doubting but it would meet with yotir Â»p 1
and be as agreeable to you to be t
informed of their praise worthy request, as 3
it was to us by having it in our power to 1
1" grant them five hundred dollars and ten bar- t
rels of flour, at a time v. hen we had con
cluded to fulpend the fupplics as our fellow- a
j citizens had returned home and employment u
was attainable ; yet there might bÂ« tiume- t
rous cases wherein this worthy female foeie- 11
ty might indulge themselves in visiting the t<
' mansions of distress and thereby give relief d
to many \wofe iituations would never have 1
been othfrwife known. ; d
Although we have the above balance-be
lideS wood, potatoes, and flour, we fear it t;
will be scarcely fjfficiVnt to meet the nuir.e- p
rous wants of the inhabitants during the ap- j e<
proaching winter. | ei
Having been as brief as poflible in giving ' c
you a detail of our proceedings, a more mi-1 1
aiute one we should be willjng to afford by j m
a conference with any persons who may feel ' u
themselves interested in the expenditure of L

Ely Communications.
At A writer in the last Minerva, under the
iti- head of Communication, abferves upon the
>le- cafe of the (hip America, adjudged in Eng
un- land upon the principle, that a Britilb fub
aty j e <3, though he remivttfto America, is still
of a British fubjeQ. This principle may per
tnd haps be deemed rigid,,but if it is sometimes
sen hard, it sometimes proves beneficial, and
at, gives a man, born in England, the adrsnta
un- /ges of a natural fubjeA. Is there any na
:he tion that allows a man to throw offhiscoun
eci- try at pleafurc, as he would his boot* ?
er- which the writer seems to think the true
to do&rme. The French (hot the poor Count
a- de Sombreveil, who was takeu at Quiberon,
ids 3nd they gave their emigrants no quarters,e
es s ven in war, because they hold to the doc
a- trine this writer so much abominates as ex
-lif clufively Bntifh. What doss the writer al
in 1 luded to think the true system i Was Bar
fix- ; ney right ? May a man fay hocus pocus,
us ; and then, of right and with a good con
j science, fit out a privateer or take a French
to , commiiuon to rob his own countrymen on
ve the high seas ? Is there such magic power
til in a I'rench cockade ? Is there morcgood
n. sense, more patriotism in that proceeding
than in the unchangeablenefs of British al
_ legiance ?
:r . So much for the fubjeft and argument of
id your correspondent. The â  coarseness and
>e istempÂ«ra*ce of his paragraph speak for
3r themselves.
f. One of the chief caufcs of our profiting so
j. little by experience is, that we badly com
re prebend itsleflbns. Indeed it is said that
r . men never grow wife by any experience but
r . their own ; because, perhaps, no other it
well enough understood. The aftonifliing
,t revolution in Paris, oÂ£ the 4th September,
> 1797, wiU form a great article in future hif
e tory. We know few Â®f its circumftancei
is aad causes, but to those who will not wait [
o long to make up a final judgment, we offer ,
the following remarks : ,
i- The DiredWy, confiding of five persons, i
â - and the two Ltgiflative Councils, arifwer- 1
t ing to our American' Senates and Reprefen
. tatives, diFagreed. The Directory, har
- in g gained the armies, had it ir. their power .
e to decide the difput-e by forÂ«e, and it was (
f decided by beat of drum in half a dayâ
c Then it was easy to obtain from the new mo- a
i delled councils, after ontf third were bani(h- F
- ed, laws and resolves to kÂ«ep the beaten par- *
t ty down, and to assure the people that their
. political salvation was once more accomplish- a
. j ed. Which party was right, or whether c
| either fcufflcd for any thing but power is a
r; left to time and to the wife to decide.
. | There is, no doubt, much of mystery in
â  j most political affairs ; and those of France p .
[ have long been deemed unfathomable.â '
* Like other men of common learning and
â  underflanding, we can only compare what tf
we do not perfectly know with what we do. at
â¢ Now how would it be in Americaâln Pa- f"
ris near sixty Representatives and Senators,
and two of the five Direiiors arc turned
out and banished, in half an hour, to die
of the yellow fever on tha eoaft of Africaâ
How would such a thing proceed in Ame- sl
rica ?
Here a law must be firfl passed, descri
bing the crime, and pointing out banifhinent ty
as the punishment. Then a grand and pc- tii
tit jury must decide on the offence foleinnjy ta
and plainly charged and describedâand if k
either of the r aid juries (hould decide against th
the wishes of the Federal Government, the ca
laws would fay to our rulers, " thus far (hall h"c
ye go, and no farther," But iri France, a h
juftica goes by the beat of. the drum, and Ai
much quicker. Now which is best, Ame- th
ricar. liberty, or French ? Some have here- re
tofore pretended to douht.
One line of difference and immense- E'
ly important it is, lies here, that all power to
in France aSually rests in the fame hands W 1
It is theJinglenefs, tbe unity of that power !Z<
that envenoms the curfc of their tyrannyâ
that makes every stroke of its whip draw wt
bloodâit is an ele&ric slash, that kills and cai
consumes, without warning and without St
redress. Ati
In the United States of America, the
power that disposes of life and liberty is di- W
vided. Those who make laws are fnbjeft to fe>'
them in faft, as well as in name, and those tin
who submit to the laws find them a rod of wh
iron, which oru(hes them, if they offend, wfl
but a wall of brass, if they are innocent. de(
In a word, our liberty is in our own keep- *ec
ing. For the juries, in thr cafe of the gov- gre
crninent's desiring to perftfeute private citi- itrc
zens, is that of brass. By- the independ
ence of the judicial power, the government of
is never so fceisle as when it would be def- rev
potic. dor
These oljfervations lead to the error and con
imperfection of the French system, and cite
ought to ijpprefs upen every reflecting mind fait
the nlasof ttieM,/and /rx'iifaerty of our
country, in which every citizen is jecure,
cm attil j'As so. How much is this experiment-:
the ed iecunty to be preferred to the for,t!iy and
l'anguinary abiiractions of French philo
the fi-phy : '

RV DAY. I y(
Tiu deputies of St. Domingo, admitted
by the law of yesterday (Lavaux and Brot- n ,
tier) took the oath. Lavaux at length ab- j eJ
tained permifÃon to fpcak. My firll duty,
said he, is to make known the exadl (late of | b<
the colony of St. Domingo, and to eradi- at
cate the ill imprvllions which the enemies of I ]y
liberty have spread abropd in France, and, a t
above all, in the fca-port towns, which as- [ ol
Aiding recitals have so much dittrefled them I en
that they do not believe trade can be again I f c
revived in that colony. j ; n
This l;'centiou3 faition, which the 18th Q f
Frudlidor has brought tojnllice, presented j c h
to you the patriots of St. Domingo, those I S 1
who defendedit, as blood-fuckers, diforsfan- | . !(
tzcrs, and dilapidators. They hope infea- j cl;
fibly to bring you tobelieve,. that the blacks t h
were not worthy of enjoying liberty. You jt o
I cannot, citizens, allure the tranquility of ex
St. Domingo, but in giving a new confirm- I th
ation to the decree of th.e 16th Pluviofe, J BR
which proclaimed the liberty of the blacks. I
\v hat interest would the black hav# to de- j mc
fend the colony, if lie had not at the fame J V at
time to defend the right of a Freneh citizen, j fâl
which had been accorded to him ? Vainly J ift
will the troops $f France be relied upon to j tJ O
defend St. Domingo. Experience has pro - [ are
ved that the climate has cut down a very rna
great part, ar.d that the fatigues of war de- h?i
ftrÂ»yth C reft._ J,
What can induce you to annul the decree ble
of the 16th Fluviofe ? can it be the eott'n- a g {
revclutioary report, of Vaublanc of Bour- a':,c
don de Loiie ? The 18th of Fructidor has p o \
convinced you that they only wanted to ex- abl
cite a civil war in France ; they had the Â«
fame intentions for &it. Domingo."
;)ur Lavaux then made an eulogy on the ge
â¢re, iiTals Touflaint LoUvertur.-, Pierre Mi
nt- ehel, L'F.veille Moife, Vitiate, Pajot, and
Â»nd of a number of other officers,

200 French emigrants weic found, propri
etors of estates j not one was killed ; they
are all in America. At the taking of Era
fcarcadere, 300 of them were found; 1 fa
: '' n vecl 260 of them, who are now , upon their
5 ." plantations. It is thus that' men called
i/iri cannibals, have coftdu&etl themselves. If
l:u we had been wiHinjr to deliver up the colo
ur* ny to the enemy, of which we are accused,
"y'' (honld we have defended it at a time when
. ' every morning several per fans were found
ian wftH hunger ; , when we had nothing
r , r - to live upon but com and sugar c*;ies.
tep Vaublanc has called us diforganiiers ; but
has he forgot that when I took the com
~ mar.d of the northern part of St. Domingo,
all the sugar plantations were burnt ; that a
year afterwards (thanks to the vigilance of
PerroudJ ninety four plantations were re-ef
'^' tnblifhed, and that his admiuillration has
J. s been able to provide for all the wants of the
colony, without scarcely receiving any fuc
sur cours from the metropojis. It is to him
jur that lam indebted for the fuceefs of my
jr- projects. At my departure the colony ow
>ur ed only 800,000 livres. In fine, to all the
1 Â° calumnies which have been uttered ag .inft
r Â°l me " n f w f r Â» that I have dene my duty ;
jll and I swear to do it here also.

" For many ages., despotism had banili- c
ed the genius of liberty, which in ancient d
times covered the {hores of the Mediterra- ei

began to reconcile nations to each other, L
and when the torch of philosophy was rapid- us

at the progress of reason, formed an impi- co
ous league to eietinguilh knowledge, or to ur
erapoifon its effefts. Uniting the links of pi
servitude which each of them had separately vH
in his hand, they forged, amidlt the gloom br
of their political dungeons, an oppressive ha
chain, which was soon to have encircled the lig
glebe. Their fanguiuary quarrels about the to
portions of this chain which each of there Pa
claimed to preserve, served only to make ga
them more unanimous in their disposition co
to aggrevate its weight and to hasten th# pr<
execution of their plan. They believed dil

TUESDAY NOVEMBER 28.
, ~l* /TR, S. Smith appeared to day for
.lVi. the fa'ft time this feflion.
Mr. Otis presented the petition of Jona
than Jackfoii, Supervisor of the State of
Massachusetts, ttating that the duties of his
office were so greatly encreafed that he found
it impossible to make his returns to govern
ment in due time, without assistance ; he
rprjys,- therefore, to be allowed additional
compensation, that he may be enabled to
employ a clerk or (w, as necessity may re
quire.âReferred to the Secretary of the
Trcafury.
Mr. O. also presented the petition of De
â¢ borah Gannett, praying compensation for
bher fetvicesas a fojdicr in the revolutionary j
war, under the name of Robert Shirtliff, ;
flat ing, that (he is able to produce certificates
not only cf her having served, but also of j
her having been wounded. âReferred to :
the Committee of Claims.
Mr. Coit moved for the order of the day j
. oil the reported answer to the Prelident's
Speech.
The motion being agreed to, the House
accordingly resolved itfelf into a committee
of the whole upon that fubjeÂ£t, Mr. Dent
in the Chair, and the Address having been
read through by the Chairman (as given in
our paper of yesterday) it again read
by paragraphs. The four firft were read,
without any objefhon being offered to them.
The fifth being gone through,
Mr. Pinckney said he had to propofea
small alteration to this clause. He wished
to the latter part of it a little less harlh.
Instead of faying, " we shall infill upon the
fame justice from others," &c. bethought
it would have the fame efi'eft, and the terms
Vould be less objedlionable, if the passage
ran thus, " nothing shall be wanting on our
part to obtain the famejuftice from others,"
&e. The expreflion used, he said, might be (
- perfefUy juftifiable, but if we could obtain :
i what we wished, without the poflibility of
I .giving offence, he thought that mode ought
to he preferred. It was on this account that
he wiihed the phraseology to be changed.
âMr. VINABtE' would suggest an amend- 1
â¢ ment, which he thought would produce the
effeft wished by the gentleman just fat down,
without changing the phraseology so much I
as he had proposed : The way in which this
might be done, would be by flriking out
the word " insist," and inserting that of
expeft.
Mr. Pikckney did not think this amend
ment would produce the effeiS he wiflied.â
I Expeftation, he said, might be entertained,
without making an effort to obtain the ob
jeft. We had already expeffed'z long time
without effeft. He wished to express the
fame firmnef6 which the committee intended
by their report ; but, at the fame time to
avuid any thing like harshness. If th* effeft
of the proposed substitute had appeared to
be the fame, he fhonld have been sorry to
have cavilled about words.
Mr. RvtliÃc e a* a member of-the
committee W U:.??rtÂ«l the address, he did
not feel tenacious as to the wcraing oi i*.
" At firft, hie thought with his colleague, who
proposed the amendment, that the word in/JJI
was* rather harsh ; but, upon a little reflcc
_ tion, his objeftions to the phrase were remo
ved. Indeed, be thought the proposed a
mendment would make the pafiagc stronger
than it was in the original. They might
' " insist, he said in argument ; looking upon
the treaty as a good one, they might infill
upon its execution ; but if it were net to
be effe&ed without goingto war, they m:ght
afterwards relinquish it. The amendment
he thought more forcible. It said nothing
shall be wanting to obtain,'&c. Which would
"be to fay, we look upon the Treaty as a
good one, and nothing ihall be wanting on
our part to obtain its fulfilment. The words
might be even considered to fay, that we are
determined to have the treaty carried into
Â«fftÂ£l, though war should be the price of
the determination.
Mr. Venable said, it was an objcdtion
to the proposed amendment that the lame
phraseology occnrred in the last paragraph.
He thought, therefore, it would be belt to
change the words in the way he had suggest
ed ; for though the word e X pj3 was less
harsh, ke thought it equally forcible with
Bayard was in favour of the amend
ment of the gentleman from S. Carolina,
and if the fame phraseology had beeni propo
âº fed in the feleft committee, he should there
have supported it. He did not think the
fu'oftitute which had been proposed by the
â¢ gentleman from Virginia would produce the
effeft intended by the gentleman from S.
Carolina. It was the intention of the com
mittee who repotted the address, to fay
something on the fubjeft; but the proposed
substitute said nothing. As to the objection
of the gentleman, on account of the fame
phraseology occurring in another part of the
'iddrefa, there would be no difficulty iniec
- tifving that, so 33 to produce that variety
which the gentleman fcemcd so delnous of
hj Mr! 'Dayton (the Speaker) approved of
,be amendment of the gentleman frorri S.
Carolina, but not from the reasons which
that gentleman had urged m support ot it,
but for tbofe which his eolleague hac. pro
duced againit it ; not because it was n,iore
smooth, but because it contained more of
liucifion and firmnefs. He tnou-ht, in this
refoeft, this country had been trifleo w.t.i,
and any opinion expre-ffed by them upon
Liiij fut]iiÂ£t, ought to be done with a firm
riefs of tens. ~ â
Mr. Livixgston fcid, ?.s gertlerrseri
thought it aeceP.ary to give the reasons of
their vote npon the occaiion, he would just
mention his. IF it were intended to be in
ferred by the phrafeolugy used upon this oc
casion, as some gentlemen seemed to fup
pofe,that they were difpifed to go to war in
support of the executive in their confirm:-
tion of the negoeiation with Spain, he was
not prepared to fay this for his constituents.
He did not think the l'ubjefl was fufficiently
matured to give this decision. He consi
dered the proposition as a general one, and
preferred the amendment of the gentleman
from S. Carolina to the orginalâHe did
not, indeed, think it matcirally different,
until he heard the objections urged against
it by a gentlemSn who was upon the Com
mittee (Mr. Rutledge). Hs bad said they
might injijt in argument. How infill in ar
gument ? What had that House to do with
argument? Were they to carry on the
Treaty? No. All the infiftlng they could
(hew m;ift be by aSs and not by arguments.
The Mr. Pinckney's amend
msnt was put and carried, there being six
ty two members in the affirmative.
The remainder of the address was then
gone through, without further observation.
Mr. Hauler enquired whether it would
now be in order to go back to the firft par
agraph. On the chairman's informing him
it would, he said lie thought there was an
expreflion in the latter part of that para
graph which would require alteration. He
meant that part which spoke of the law
which contemplates contagious sickness at
the feat of government. He supposed the
committee meant to recommend fueh a law,
as he believed there was not a law of that
kind at present in existence. He therefore
moved to flrike out the words which had
this reference.
Mr. Otis said, hii friend from S. Caro
lina had overlooked the law in question,
which was pasTed in 1794, inconsequence
of the contagious sickness which had been
experienced in this city the preceding year,
and which gave to the President of the Unit
ed States, the power of convening Congress
in any other place.
Mr. Harper acknowledged his mistake,
and that his proposed amendment was there
fore unnecessary.
Mr. Harper said, he wished to propose
an alteration in the phraseology of the fourth
clause. It did not appear to him to be very
polite, to talk to other Nations about their
jealousy and avarice ; and whatever might
be the latitude proper to be taken in private
debate, when the House expressed itfelf
publicly, he thought all unnecefTary harlh
nefs (hould be avoided. He wished, there
fore, to flrike out some words, and intro
duce others, so that the passage instead of
reading as at present, might be thus express
ed : â¢' and white the exleti/ion of our Naviga
tion and Trade may excite jealousy and tempt a
â¢varice five are, of."
Mr. Bayard was opposed to this amend
ment He did not think the phraseology
could give umbrage to any Nation whate
ver, lince no Nation could apply the phrase
to itfelf. If the gentleman would confidcr
the paragraph, he would find, that it was
hot said that any particular Nation was jea
lous or avaricioue; but merely, if any Na
tiofl were possessed of jealtfufy and avarice,
o\fr Navigation and Trade would naturally
excite their jealousy and t eir.pt their avarice.
Any general sentiment might as well be ob-
Jested to as this. When it was said that
the riches of one man t;mpt the avarice of
others, it could not possibly be inferred
th't asy pjriicaiar man was pointed at.
Mr. Harper did not thii>k the amend
ment of very great importance, though of
fufficient to be adopted. He did not think
any nation could juflly take the expreflion
to itfelf, or rhat they tould with propriety
be offended at it ; but he thought it bettet
to avoid all harsh expressions. He thought
a proper degree of spirit, and even ofaagei
and revenge, might be (hewn, without un
becoming expressions ; not that he meant tc
fay the expreflion in question was tinbecom
ing, but he thought it was haifh. H(
was alfoof opinion thatthc discriminations 01
his friend on the fubjeft of jealousy and.ava
rice were more nice than solid.
The queflon was then put on Mr. Harper's
amendment, and negatived 47 to 33.
The Committee then rofc and reportec
the address with one amendment. lh<
House took it up aad agreed to the a
mendment.
Mr. BaVard then moved an amendment
to correft the phraseology of the last para
graph, so as not to claih with the amend
ment ; bat the speaker informing him th<
amendment could not be~ introduced withou
a recommittal the Address was agreed t(
without further amendment.
Mr. Otis moved, that the Speaker, at
tended by the House, shall present the faic
address to the President of the Unite*
States ; and that a committee be appointei
to wait upon the President to know whei
andwhere it will be convenient to him t<
receive the fame.âAgreed.
Mr. Hap.per moved that the House re
solve itfelf into a committee of the whole, o
the report of the secretary of State, on th
memorial of Antonia Carmichael, widow 0
William Carmichael, deceased ; which be
ing agreed to, the House resolved itfelf ir.t
a committee accordingly, and the repot
was read from the chair.
It appears that the late William Carm
chael (formerly a delegate in Congrefsfror
Maryland) was appointed secretary of leg:
tion to Mr. Jay, minister plenipotentiary fc
negociating a treaty with the king of Span
in "September, 17 79 ; that the coinmiffion

Hence it follows that Mr. C. was entitled of
not only to the salary of locol. sterling as , an
secretary, but to iuch other allowances as an
were proper to be made to a charge des as- â  w'

A concurrence wiih this report was advocated j
by Mfflrj. Harper, Hartley, Pinckney, Sprigg, (
Gallatin, Bayard, Craik, and T. CUibora, on the
grouad of equity and humanity. It was oppefed [
by MeOra. Williami, Macon, and Coit; they with- 1
ed for further time and information on the fubjeft, 1
and for that purpose, Mr. Williams moved that
the committee rife, in order that it might be dis
charged from a farther confWeration of the fubjeft,
and tlut the Viufiuefj might be referred to the com
mittee of claims. It was urged by the fri-nds of
the report, that farther information could not be
had than was contained in the report, aud that the 1
principle might as well now be decided up*n as nt
any diflaet period ; that being a cafe founded on
equity anÂ£not on law, it was not a proptr (Ã¼bjcA
to be transferred to the tommittee of claim'-
They urged also, that a deby of j'.ftice was in (
this, aÂ« in most other cases, a denial of it ; that
tlcc'ellatet of the widow were mortgaged, and had
been kept from sale from the 1 opek of feceiving
what flae petitioned for from coiigtvfs. At length
thÂ« motion for ihe committee to rife was put and 1
negatived, there being only seven vote in favor of
it. A resolution was thÂ«u agreed te, authorizing
the accounting officeis of the trralury to fettle the
account, and a committee appointed to bring in a
bill.
Mr. I.ivinoston that the petition of An
drew Pipfiin, and the report therecn, be referred
Jo the committee of claims.âAgreed.
Mr. Otis, from the committee to
wait upon the President, tohr.ow when and where
it would be conveniint to liirn to recÂ»ive the ad
dress in answer to his fpeccb, reported that they
had attended to that fervic*, and that it would be
convenint to him to receive it at his houl'e, to

Mr. .Swanwick present 'd the petition of Ed

FATAL INSANITY.
Yeftcrday about noon Ferdmad Leowen
ftern, aged about 40, and a young woman
by the name of Elizabeth Folkenhan, aged
24, were found dead in a bed at Miss Eol
kenhan's in the Bowery.
On this truly (hocking discovery a jury
1 of inquest was immediately fuanmoned, who
found, by letters which were on the table
â  from each party, aud other corroborating
i circumflances, that they had mutually a
: greed to die in this wayâon which they
â  adjudged, that Leowenftern firft (hot Eliza
â  beth Folkenhan, by her consent, and then
1 (hot himfelf.
It appears, that her filter had sent to the
house by a negro buy, but could not get ad
- mittance j and while the door was breaking
1 open, the discharge of a pistol was heard ;j
- and 011 afeending, both th<* man aud woman j
r werÂ« found dead, and two pistols appeared '
, in such a position as convinced the Jury of j
s thejuftnefs of their verdiCt. The parties !
t are f'id to have been disappointed lovers.

and Gorki's boats, were inftaptiy manned, r
and with the Lively, sent jjp pnrfuit of them
while a party of military was sent by land, "
to prevent their landing.âTheir being pur- j ;
sued obliged them to abandon their prize,
and to effect a retreat, after plundering the
vefiel and almofl; killing the mailer.âThe
wiÂ»d being too light, two of thena got into,i
the platform, the otherladen with the spoils,
ran alhore, and, as is their cu(toi*V the Bri
