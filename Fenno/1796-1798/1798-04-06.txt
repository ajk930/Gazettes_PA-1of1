MR. FENNO,
From what I can colieft from your pa
per, of which T am a constant reader, mat
ters are growing very icrioui indeed. But
so far as I can fee, it "is in a great measure
our own fault. I wonderwhatcculdhave put
it into our heads to affront these terrible
Frenchmen i 1 never liked our proceedings,
that I mud fay ; and I always thought it a
very imprudent thintg, to make Mr. Adarns
. President, when by elefting Mr. Jefferfon
we might have pacified them, and thereby
have efcapedthedreadful consequences which
are now about to fall on us. But dont ydu
think it will be much the best for us, to 2-
void war at all events ? In the firft place,
it will cost us a great deal of money, and
if such a fellow as Buonaparte (hould get
among us-âGod help us ! what havoc lie
w&uld make ! Whereas if we patiently sub
mit to there, and sooth them, instead of
faying harsh things to provoke them, I can
not help thinking that they will fpa'rc the
most of us : and as they fectn very fond of
government, -1 douf in thtrleaft dopLt, but
they will entirely save us thai trouble. Per
haps they may guillotifie a frw of our aris
tocrats, and such as have fpokt and wrote
againftthem; bo,t I cannot think ihey are
.fobad, as to hlirt tbofc who have talked "in
their foVbr ; and' For thr own 'pari, I defy
any body to prove that I ever said a word a
gainst them. As to the great pother that
is made aboiit our trade and merchants
fering, and all thatâl fee nothing in it.
A man in not obliged to be a mercharit. I.et
htm follow some other employment. These
i^a great scarcity of hatids'iii the couatty,
and good wages going. Beiides, it iÂ°9 very
hard that thrifty prudent people, who have
scraped together, a-little ftiug property,
and have nothing to do with trade (houid
ftfSer forthofe who chufe ta fullctv it. Ev
ery man forl.irnfelf, fay I.
I wish too, with all my heart, that some
of ourgreat men in congress would coru'iuft
themselves with more discretion, and not
fay such provoking things of-our fitter re
public. I never could fee any life in pro
voking angry people. Now there $ t'ue
-viftory tlidt admiral Duncan gained over the
Dutch. It has turned out exactly as neigh
bor Wif-acre tyld me ic would. He said,
fays he, " it will only make 'em more
rious," and so it has, for now they artj go
ing to tear up England by the roots for it.
Or.e fcarceiy knows well what to believe,
there are so many. diSjreut ilorics goinjr,
but I can hardly think them so very wicked
as Peter Porcupire, and f#me other folks
represent them. As to their killing their
king, qneen, noblemen and prieils, what
have we to do with that? None of us are
kings, queens, noblemen or priefis, â¢ Some
of us to be sure, have got a little money,
but (ince we bear no titlts, are good repub
licans, and love the poor dearly (or at least
fay we do) they can have no cause to quar
rel with us. I am-determined, however,
to be prepared for the word, so have bo't
myfelf a French grammar, and am learning
the language. 1 have already spent a good
deal of time in learning to fay Mounfeer ;
but neighbor Wife acre tells me it is all
thrown awav, and thst if I ".-as to call one
tffrjJtcni Moui.fter, i ibov.lsj be g" 1 -"' 1 * 8 ' .
lor an ariilocrat. lit ttlls me, I mud call
'em fijtjiycp- or fcnje fut'li comics! nam?. ,
'Hien he /ays, I mud not cail the mouths
by their old names-os January, ivbruary,
&c. nor firft fecond month, as the
{Quakers do, but Slivofe, IJltfviolc* VqtiLofe
and the k>rd knows how many other ofes.
And then he fays, they have no fiich thing
as fuflday among themâand that the queer
toads do not reckon by weeks, but some
thing they call decades and another plaguy
hard word that founds like lottides, but it's

ALEXANDRIA, March 3 Â».
FROM EUROPE.
The feip Ann, Captain Black, belonging
to this town, arrived this morning from
St. Ãbes, after a paflage of 48 days.
Captain Black has favored us with tic
following intelligence.
Left in St. Ãbes the (hip Charlotte, of
New-London, capt. Fitch, and the fl>tÂ£>
discharging balladâthe ship Ann and Ca
tharine, of New-York, capt. Lowring, ta
king in Â£ak, and the-biig Fanny, of New
buryvPort, capt. Stover, ready to fail next
day after usâthefc four fail being all the
Americans in St. Ãbes.
A.few hours after leaving St. Ãbet, was
spoke by a British 74 gun (hip, (leering for
the bar. of Lisbon ; the afternoon of the
fame day, save a fleet of ten fail of line of
men of war flanding towards the Rock of
Lisbon, supposed them to be part of adthi
;ral J?rvis's fleet. Also, during
he by in Sr. Ãbes, a French frigate of 40
guns was taken and brought into Lisbon by
a Portuguese 64 gun rtiip, after an engage
ment of two and an half hours 5 and it it
said to be the firft capture of a (hip of war
made by the Portuguese during the present
war. Seven or eight French privateers
(which very much infefted that coast) were
also taken and brought into Lisbon about
the fame time; one of them is called the
Dumourier, and carries" 28 guns.
The invasion of Portugal by the Freftch
and Spaniards was much talked of and ge.
nerally believed : a very great alarm was
raised in Lisbon and different parts of Por
tugal on that Sccoflnt. In order to efFeÂ£l
this invnfion, the Frehch are said to have a
dopted the following plan :âln the firft in
stance, have a hundred thousand troops
marching towards the frontiers, and fifty
thousand more embarked on board of trans
ports,' mostly at Toulon, &c. under the
prote&ion of twelve fail of the line, to o
pen a passage for thim out of the Mediter
ranean : and secondly, the Spanilh fleet
is to be, compelled to go *ut and figÂ»t ad
mirtil Jarvis âand in thus Sacrificing the
Spanilh fleet to the Engli'fli, Jarvis, of couffe
will be obliged to make for forae friendly
port with his prizes, and no doubt much
(hattered fleet. During that interval, the
French fleet tvill find n<i opposition in mak
ing the mod convenient choicrof a hnding
place, any where along the Portuguese
coast.
This plan is in one refpeft reafouable,
and might be carried into effedt ; but oppo
fedto that, is the facrificing of the Span
i(h grand fleet ; which surely the court of
Madrid cannot approve of, nor the deep
laid politic lc'nemesOf the French dire&oty
jtlftify :âBe that as it will, it has created
much uneasiness in Portugal, although at
present, the conr,ts of Madrid and Lisbon
are otl friendly and pacific terms.

FRIDAY EVENING, AprP 6.
Outlines of the InflruÃians and
Difpntchri.
It if enough to fav that the inftruftions â¢
were as ample, as conciliatory as the objeft
to be attained could pofTibly require.Â» That 1
France was offered either such modification j
of her old treaty as would meet and rertiove
her complaints against it, or if flie would
prefer a new one (he was to tÂ»e* gratifiedâ
Ar.y advantages given to the'Britifh were to
be offered to herâ Although, indeed, the
commifiioners were not by any treaty to re-'
linquidi the right of future indemnification.
The eemmiffioners on their arrival at Paris,
wrote a letter to Talleyrand communicating
the objeft of their million ; to this letter
they had received no anftver at the time of
theirlaft dispatchesâbut two persons called
bn the commifiioners, told them thty were
in the ptrfeK confidence of Talleyrand, and
opened a conversation on the fubjexft of their
million. They dated iSat the Direftnry
were much enraged at the speech of the Pre
sident at the last f.immer session, and that it
was necessary fonie disavowal of his senti
ments or some atonement for thera should
"be made â : the Â«ommiffioiiers replied they had
no po\ver to drfavow or atone for those sen
timents, that the President by the Conftitu
tioa had a right to communicate his fenti
mentson the state of the union to Congress,
thai they were his own feniiments and the
government had nothing to do with them :
fevtral communications passed on this fub
jeft before a diredt avowal was made_of the
kind of atonement required-; at length i; came
outâM.ney, money, money, was all the cry.
Douceurs to an enormous amount*%ere de
manded for the officers ; as they complained
that while some of the Dire&ory had plen
tiful fourcts of wealth, others of them were
deficient. Several other extravagant de
mands cf loans and money were made in the
ma(| (hamelcfs and insolent mannerâOur
commi&oners talked of treating on terms of
jvftice, reciprocity, &c. They were laughed
atâwhen you treat with the Indians, said
our brotherly allies, do you not pay for
peace & when you treat with the Algerines,
do you not give money for peace ? have we
not made Hamburgh, Portugal &c. pay,
and (hall not too ? our commifiion
ers obje&edâthey were, then reminded of
the fate of Venice. They were told when
Great Britain is overthrown the terms will
be more severe 5 take the present opportu
nity. The commissioners rtprefented that
fueh proceedings would unite America againfl
them, and that America when uhited would
be invulnerable. Poh ! poh 1 said the French
menâthat is impoflibleâwe know how to
manage that matterâyou know we are very
expert at intrigueâwe havetoo many friends
in. your countryâyou can't hurt us thereâ
we will contrive to make it believed in Ame
rica that the failure of the neguciationâ
that all the evils you fuffer, are owing to
the conduft of the federalijls, or as we name
them, the Briiijh Faftion in the United
States âtake the present opportunity, pay
money, and save yourselves. Finally, Mr.
Gerry informed Talleyrand of these conver
fa:i<jns, and aiked him if the men alluded
to, ieal!y possessed his confidence arid fpokc
his sentimentsâTalleyrand said that they
did. But if all these things had been com
pKed with, what were we to have in return ?
why, our commissioners were to fcfe admitted
to a negociation, and Talleyrand was to
promise; his influence to prevent any futher
spoliations
The Douceurs required for the officers,
were 1,200,000 Livers, about Â£50,000
sterling. We were to take at par about
33,000,000 of Dutch florins, the value of
which is now 50 per cent, under par, and
look to the Dutch for the deficiency at.the
peace, with other enormous rcqutfitiori? to
the amount cf many millions of dollar*.
MR. FEN NO,
I Have read in Bache's paper of this
morning a paragraph which (iate9, that the
vote of the Senate for publishing the Prefi.-
dent's message of the 3d inft. with the com
munications of pgr Envoys " had a majo
rity of two." The implication, from this,
that the majority was only " two," is fatfe.
An honourable member of the Senate, for
whose veracity, writer of this would
pledge his life, has declared, that on the
vote, there â¢was no Jivtfi&n. That to the mo
tion foe publication snoppofition was made,
but when it became certain that it would
prevail, the oppofittort was withdrawn, and
on the question being put, but two members
pronounced " no." This publication from
Bache's paper, comes as near the truth, as
would be expe&ed, frcm that
vehicle of pollution and falfehood.
A few observations, Mr. Fenno, on the
propriety of the order cA the Senate, may
probably be expedient.âBefore the motion
to call 011 the Prefidcnt was made, the ene
mies of the government, who are known as
the devoted friends and tools of France,
yrete every where, in Congress and out of
it, not only infinnating but as boldly as
wickedly pronouncing, that the Executive
was in'idioufly pursuing the system of his
predccefforâa system intended to involve
this country in war with France ; and rely
ing on the obvious motives *o withhold a
communication of his inflruflions, and the
of the ministers, with the
most abominable impudence, they affirmed,
that the Prefidcnt dared not dfclofe his eon
dvi}. At a time when our very existence
was at risque, and there appeared no means
at defeiH/ng the nefarious intentions of' an
abominable fp&ion, which had brought
their country to the brink of, ruin, but
by a full diÂ£Â»lofi>.e, the neceflity of making
it, tho' painful, had become inevitableâ
When the secret was committed to the Le
glflature it was no longer pofiible t > prevent
iii; circnlaticn of Itâttuonly question then J
whether the people fnvuld be fnilyin- j
formed, ti- left to the ftfuking f
from mificprcftntE'ion and mifconeepticn. c
Of the alternative the eledtion coald not be 1
difficult.
It has been said that the publication en- t
dangers the fafety of our envoys. If this c
conje&ure was well founded, it would as- I
ford a concluftve reason against the measure. ' 1
But when we arc. told, in these very dlf- t
patches, that our country abounds with the t
aÂ£tive and ikilfull agents, of the wicked t
ffiifcreailts, who govern France and are dÂ«- t
folating the world ; and when tire kuow that t
in our streets, before the vote in the senate, i
the precise amount of the fbfnrts of corrup- j
tion were Hated, it was irrVpo(!?t>Ve Wt to 1
conclude, with certainty, that the diredlo- <
ry would have the substance of the commu- |
liication, by the iirfl pofiible opportunity. ' 1
The mifchief, therefore, as it refpe&ed our ]
ministers, was already done ; and the only 1
question vas, whether the opportunity of i
eftablilhing a deferred confidence in that 1
great and good man the Prefidef!t,andUnion
among adeludtd and divided peopleâa con- 1
fidence and union rndifpenfable to our secu
rity, flionld be embraced. A. Z. j
THEATRE.
A very crouded and fplbndid theatre as
sembled last evening for the benefit of Mr.
Fennell. A general clamour was made for
the President's March. Whenthetune
was played, the uproar and applause from
all quarters of the house were l'o general,
so loud and so incessant that very little of
.the tunc was heard. Thus as our affe&iohs
are withdrawn from foreign influence, the
warmth of the public love and griiitude
for our own worthies, our real benefadtors
will rtturn with redoubled vigor.

From the Bojlon Columbian Centinel.
On the Subject of ARMING.
MR. RUSSELL,
IN the course of some observations I
made in your last Centinel in reply to a wri
ter in the Chronicle, I hats oCcafton to touch
on the fubjeel of arming our Merchantmen
and (hips of war in certain cales ; a mea
sure which we are told is in contemplation
in the National Legislature." The fubjeit
was too important to admit of being treat
ed on in a cursory way, Snd it "was then my
intention, to confidsr it more at large in a
future paper, aid in dying this it i* proper
to set prejudice aside and fuffer ourselves to
be influenced by no other consideration than
a regard to the public good.
In confidcring this measure there are two
questions, one is the right, the other the
expediency. Although lam sensible that
those with whom we have to contend, would
| consider only the latter question withotv: re
gard to the former, were they call :d on to
| decide a matter of similar importance ; yet
! the refped we owe to the opinions of other
nations, and thejuftice due to a goodcaufe
; which ought neVer to be confounded with
a bad one, makes it proper firft to cÂ»nfider
the question of right-* This is more pro
per at this time, when every artifice that 1
base and designing men can employ is bro't
forward to deceive the people as to the
views of our administration ; aÂ»d when the
arming to defend against unprovoked outra
; ges is attempted to be imposed upon the
people as an open declaration of hostilities.
1 (hall endeavour to (how that by precedent
and the law of nations we possess this right
and that byourexillir.g treaties with France,
the right is clearly implied. The law of
| nations it is true, gives to powcrsat war the
right of going onboard neutrals and mak
ing peaceable feareh for articles of merchan
dize declared to be contr*baud ; but this in
always urtderftood with ihe 'limitation that
no improper force (hall be employed in the
search, much lei's that under the pretence
of legal inquiry the mod barbarous infiilts
(hall be committed, and the innocent neutral
treated like an enemy.
If any belligerent power undertakes thus
to set at defiance the rights of neutrality,
and uniformly to persist in a condu& which"
wants only the formality of a declaration to
make it completely holtih, and adds to this
conditfl, arefufal to hear the complaint of
the injured neutral ; from that moment the
ground is chauged ; the law of nature
which forms the bafts of-the law of nations
makes it not only the right but the duty of
the neutral to refill.
Accordingly we have fcen in the war of
our revolution, the northern po\vj: s of Eu
rope form a league, calling it the aimed neu
trality, in which they declared that they
armed not in defiance of the law of nations,
but because they refufd arty longer to sub
mit to those, infringements of that law,
which the belligerent powers were daily
pra&ifiug. This instance alone has fully ef.
tablilhed the law of nations on this point,
and will and ought to serve as a guide to
neutrals in similar cases. the law of na
tions juftified the armed neutrality, there
can be 110 question that our cafe much more
clearly falls within its true inteut and spirit.
By the 27th article of our treaty of auiity j
and commerce with France, it is stipulated !
" That if the fiiip* belonging to the in- i
habitants of either of the countries, be met
with by any ship, or (hips of vt-ar, or pri
vateers belonging to the other, the said (hip
of war or privateer, foe the avoiding of any
difardtr, lhall remain out of cannonJhat, and
may fend their boats on board the Jnerch.tuc ;
(hip, and may â¢ nter to the number t,f two \
or three men only, to whom the commander i
of the mei chant flii â¢ fliail exhibitliis pafiport ;
according to the form annexed ti> the treaty â¢
âand the (hip when (lie ihali have fhevved â¢!
I'iicli |n(Tport, fii.tl'i l.s fir? aÂ«^it liber')' to
p'jrjue h?r as it JSU?I 110: ben w
ful to moleil or lcarch her in any manner,
or to give hrr cliace, or to force her to quit
fcer intended conrfe "
It is a known princ'pl: in the law of na
tions, that the breach of a\r.-atyby one
of the contrasting parties absolves the other
from the obligation of performing his ilipu
lations. If we fhuw that in no inftsnce have
the French paid any refpeA to the above ar
ticle ; we have 8 right fairly to infer, that
they never can complain, fliould wÂ« refill
their bftarding our (hips when it is attemp
ted, in any other way than that above pre
feribed. Is there not an implied consent on
their prut, that if their (hips of war, or pri
tateri'S, difregaided the (lipnlation intend
ed for the " avoiding any tfforthr," they
(hall 2biJe the coofequences of their wicked
riefs or ignorance, and that the neutral (hall
be juftihed in refilling fueh illegal boarding.
Let us examine the fact. I preiume no
ir.dance can be found In which the letter or
spirit of the article has been complied
with, a provision which every man will fee
to be highly proper and necessary ; âfor
without fonae such precaution, how is the
fieutral to diftiuguilh between an inten
tion to examine papers, or adefign to com
mit angÂ£i of piracy. laftcad of the ships
of war or privateers remaining out of can-
Iwnfiiot, have not instances happened where
a broad fide has been the firft intimation of
an intention to board i Instead of fending
their boats on board the neutral, have not
innumerable instances occurred, where they
would not hoist out their own bakts, but
, have compelled the neutrals in tempestuous
weather, and at the ri(k of their lives to
come on board them, and if I remember
right, (for 1 would not' mifneprefent a fin
! gle faÂ£t) one or more instances have hap
-1 pened, where the neutrals have perished in
I attempting,to go on board the (hips of war
jVr privateers. Whej-e they have boarded
| our veffeis, instead of-" tal\ngtrÂ»o or three
: men only," have they not always taken e
nough to overpower the neutral, and instead
of peaceably searching for contraband goods
have they not in many instances commhted
every violent again ft the unresisting crew
---robbing them even of their wearing ap
parel, and often adding blows to other in
juries too (hocking,to be mentioned ? I for
bear to dwell on a fubjeft so painful to the
feeling of every American.âlt is enough
for my present purpose, that the law of na
tions gives 11s the right to armâgnd that
thisrightisalfofaiilf to btf implied from the
-spirit of our existing treaty with France. â 
More has been said about the expediency of
arming than about the right, and more
doubts seem to have arisen on the Igfter
than on the former question. If, in the
eourfe of this war, we had fuffered only
what neutrah may be expefted to fuffer in
all wars, from the ignorance and mifconduft
of a few of the armed veffeis of the belliger
ent powers âand if through the ordinary
channels of communication, remonstrances
might be made, and those remonstrances
were listened to, there can be no question
but that this mode of redress would be the
mod eligible.âBut let my fellow citizens
.attend to the fituatton in which we are pla
ced with France. One of our ministers has
not only not been acknowledged, but was
ordered to quit the territory of France,
with every circumstance of contempt; when
our government, laying aside their refer.t
ment at this indignity, in the true spirit of
conciliation, joined two of our mod refpedt
able fellow-citi?ens with Mr. Pinckney in
the million of Peace.âWhat treatment havÂ«
they reeeived ?âThe most .contemptuous
negledt and the fulleft assurances that they
will not be listened to by the Diredtory,
and that their overtures for healing the
breach between us and France will be dis
regarded. By this conduft, whatever in
juries we may receive, mull fail to be re
presented to the Directory, and the door of ,
communication in the ordinary way
be completely (hut. Beside refufing to re
ceive our Mjnifters, 1 appeal to every man
if they are not daily iffuiag decrees of a na-.
turemoreand mnrehsftile, . If things are so
if, as ViÂ£ior
declares.it is the intention of tjiegovern
ment to treat us with severityâis it is also
true that the (hips of war and privateers of
France are daily practiling on the theory
laid down by the Directory, what remains
for usâeither to submit to be captured a.id
ill-treated wherever their veffeis meet ours,
or by a proper and spirited resistance to con
vince the Directory, that although faithful
to our engagements, we wi(h no exemption
from any stipulation we have made in the
spirit of the Treaty ; yet that when we fee
violence and rapine usurp. the place of right
and a spirit of plunder substituted in the
room of legal inquiry, we will submit no
longer. ->> m-n ' > ~3,i .1,

From the Norfolk Herald.
However much the friends of the country have
to regret the failure of the Extraordinary EmbatTy
to tfc* French republic, and whatever reafim they
â have to depiore, that war, the great fenurge to
map, is already brought to their doors, and ready
to thunder on their defencelÂ»ii eoatLs ; yet they
I sincerely hope and firmly persuade therofelves,
that the unceasing sfforts and sincere endeavors
which the Executive has uniformly adopted to
prcferv peace, inviolate with ail nations, will
not only cause unanimity in our councils, but tend
;to the uniting of all hearts and hands m delence
of this â¢tir common andjuftly beloved country.
t he crtlr- hiving arrived wkiili calls for all u-
TiiliiijJ In defence of enjoy) under
the most mild and equitable of governments,âit
then, surely, isaot too much to presume, that all
parties will unite in defence of their property, the
independeueo, honor and interell ef their coun
try, and to prefer vÂ« the blffling' they enjoy, and
prolong them unimpaired te their posterity, by
making uft of those means which a beneficent
Providence have put them in pofleflion of, for
the defence of all that is valuable anddcar to man.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
THURSDAY APRIL Â£.
Tha Speaker laid before thehoufe an un
favourable report of the Secretary of War,
on the petition of Stephen Cantling, who
pi ays for compÂ«nfation for his services in
Major Orr's expedition into the Cherokee
country in 1794. The report was referred
to a committee of the whole, and made the
order for Monday.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee ot
claims, made a report on the petitions of
fuiidry citizens of the western couaties of
Pennsylvania, who pray for compensation
for losses and damages sustained from the ar
my and militia in the Weftprii Infurre&ion
in 1794. The report (tales, that if sup
plies were furniflied by the petitioners, and
regular vouchers are fumilhed, their ac
counts will be fettled by the proper depart-'
raents ; but if the losses complained of Were
not of this kind, they must be considered
like other fufferings consequent on a (late
of warfare, for which this goTernmeot never
made any allowances. This report was com
mitted for Monday.
On motion of Mr. Dent, the house re
solved to rcfumc the conlideration of the
confidential commsnicationsiately received
from the Preiideut, and the galleries and
house were, of coprfe, cleared of strangers.
The doors were closed till pad four o'clock,
when an adjournment took place, before a

INTO THE
ORIGIOF EPIDF.MTE DISEASES. ;
Letters to Dr. Currie, which I pubiiihed
X lad autumn, led me to an invelligation of
the origin and pheooniena of peijilantial diseases
in other countries, as well as in the United St tes.
In the p.rof< cution of the fubjea, new fads ami j
principles continually opined to Â«iy view, arid fi
nally determined me to trace back the hitlory of
such diseases as >9 the records of. hiflory e<-
tcind. For this purpose, I have examined the pub
lic libraries in New-Yolk, NeW-Haveu, Cam
