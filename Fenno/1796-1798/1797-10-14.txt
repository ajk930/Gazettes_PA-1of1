DEPARTMENT OF STATE.
Philadelphia, August Bth, 1797. hi
In the 9th paragraph of your letter, you m
fay that " after having dlfcufled the history rj
of these tranfaÂ£h'ons, with all the force and tl
accuracy which result from these obfervati- g
ons, I afTure, with a very ill-grounded con- B
fidcnce, that upon a view of the whole it ai
appears, that his majesty's governors on the ft
Mifliffippi have on various pretences, post- tl
poned the running of the boundary line and o
the evacuation of the posts." I mufl here n
also complain of misrepresentation. I did tl
not in tr.y report draw my conclusions from d
the history of these tranfaftionsâthat is, of si
the tranfaftions which you have previously t
.mentioned in your letter, and which I have Ii
already noticed in this answer : but " Upon y
a view of the whole correspondence then and d
before submitted to the president." This a
correspondence I will now examine, to fee p
whether the causes assigned by the Spanish f
governors, for postponing the running of the v
boundary line and evacuating the posts, me- c
rit the name of reasons, or of pretences. g
Governor Gayofo being informed of Mr. c
J Ellicott's descending the MilTiflippi, wrote e
to him on the 37th of February, desiring t
him to leGve his escort at Bavon Pierre, 60 f
miles above the Natchez. Yet the treaty Â£
prescribed a military escort on each fide to
tfttend the commissioners in running the f
boundary line; and the Natchez as the c
place of firft meeting. The chief rea- 5
fori offered for this request was, that if the c
troops of the two nations were brought to- j
gether, " misunderstandings," might arise r
between them. Yet the treaty required their f
coming together to attend the commiflion- 1
ers when they were jointly running the boun- 1
dary line. And the only reason the governor
afiigned for not evacuating the posts, was !
" The want of veflels," but which he ex- j
pefted would soon arrive. I
On the 25th of February, governor Gay- i
ofo and Mr. Ellicott fixed on the 19th of â 
March to proceed down the river to Clarkef
ville, near which it was supposed the bounda- 1
ry line would commence. 1
On the 9th of March governor Gayofo
informed Mr. Ellicott that the baron de 1
Carondelet could not attend the running of
the line in person, and tkat the whole busi
ness had devolved on him, the governor ; but
he feared he (hould not be ready on the 19th.
And then he endeavoured to draw Mr. El
licott from his proper station at the Natchez,
by proposing a visit to the UÂ»n at NÂ«w
Orleans.
March 12th, the governor again endea
vored to draw Mr. Ellicott from the Nat
chez, and recommended Loftus' Cliffs near
Claikefville as the point of re-unitiHg : and
by way of inducement, said that the Geo
meter and other officers to be employed on
the boundary line would stop at Clarkef
ville.
On the 15th of March, the principal part
of the artillery was taken out of the fort, and
every appearance made of a speedy evacua
tion : but on the 2ad they were carried
back to the fort and immediately remount
ed. A similar movement took plade at the
latter end of April, after the arrival of lieu
tenant Pope and his troops at the Natchez.
. " The evacuation (fays he) appeared to be
going On with great life ; when all at once
the military (lores were ordered back, their
troops busily engaged all night taking back
and remounting the cannon." Here he very
naturally expresses his surpriseâ" This kind
of conduft (fays he) appears strange."
March 23d, the governor'mentions that
orders had been by the general iu chief
r of the province, to demolish th? post at the
- Walnut Hillsâbecause their treaty with the
Indians required it : but as he (Gayofo)
, had finee been informed of their unsettled
I difpoCtious, he had sent counter-orders, to
prevent the fortifications being injured ; fug-
J gefting at the fame time that the moving of
the stores, &c. was suspended only until the
j arrival of the American troops to take pof
fedion of the post.
/ In this letter the governor informs Mr.
Ellicott that lieutenant colonel Guillemard
" was far on his way up ; and, on his arrival,
the running of the boundary line (hould bc
i.' gin. The governor adds this assurance
'/ " that there is nothing that can prevent the
religious compliance with the treaty."
On the 28th and 29th of March, gover
nor Gayofo issued two proclamations, both
bearing date the 29th, takidg new ground
for retaining the posts, viz. Until the right
1- of the inhabitants to the real property is as-
II certained. The governor is pleased tÂ® fay
18 that a negociation was on be
tween the king of Spain and the United
h States, to secure to the inhabitants of the
Natchez the righttotheir real property : that
ie thatrightcould not.befecured butbyan addi-
U tional article to the late treaty ; and that he
(hould keep poffeflion of the country until
tj that article (hould be officially communicat
ed to him ; and until they were sure that
n the Indians would be pacific. This last
reafon particularly warrants my affertionâ
j that the governors meant for an indefinite
n period to avoid the evacuation of the posts ;
r for while a tribe of Indians existed in that
' r th# governors could not be sure
that they would be pacific. And as to their
!; real property, feeing the great body of the
- inhabitants appear not to desire the patron
's age of the Spaaifh government to secure
11 it : As the government of the United States
" miift be at least as anxious as that of Spain
to p rot eft the inhabitants in their rights,
when become citizens of the United States:
I believe there can be no difficulty in dccid- gai
ing whether this is a reason or a pretence, his
Besides, the ntgociation mentioned by the tha
governor about the real property of the in- tâ;
habitants, has never exifled ; nor even been of i
proposed or hinted) either to or by the gov- 1
ernment 'of the United States, I hope, lini
therefore, it will not be deemed harsh, or mi'
unbecoming in a letter of this kind, to fay, the
that this motive for suspending the evacua- fer
tion of the podsâthat a negociation was th<
then on foot to secure the real property of 110
the inhabitantsâdoes not merit the title St
â¢even of a pretence.
So soon as the governor discovered that wi
his proclamations, infrfcad of quieting the th
minds of the inhabitants, produced a contra- U
ry effeft, he sent two gentlemen of the set- vie
dement to inform Mr. that he, the wl
governor, had received direftions front the it
Baron de Carondelet to have the artillery th
and military dores expeditioufly removed in
from the forts, which were to be given up to be
the troops of-the United States immediately th
on their ai rival. As this information did be
not remove suspicions, Mr. Ellicott wrote Y
the governor on th 6 3id of March, dating di
divers circumdances which still kept those
suspicions alive. The governor answered on fu
the fame day in dire& contradi&ion to the to
information given by the gentlefneii, his a- th
gents, to Mr. Ellicott, and confirming the fa
declarations made in his proclamations. He ei
added also a new motive for retaining the m
posts, viz. That the treaty left it doubt- b<
ful whether, when the pods should be e- bi
vacuated, the works were to be left standing, P'
or to be demolished ; concerning which the tt
governor general found himfelf obliged to ai
consult lus Catholic Majedy ; and had giv- o'
en the governor positive orders to suspend si
the evacuations of the pods until the matter a
should be amicably fettled between the two f
governments. tl
On the id of May, another motive is as- e<
signed for retaining the pojlsâThe envoy I
of his Catholic Majedy in the United ti
States, had informed the governor general p
of an attack proposed againd the Spanish "
part of Illinois (the upper part of Louifia- p
11a) by the British from Canada, and, there- i'
fore, the posts at the Walnut Hills and the t
Natchez must be kept sos the defence of i
lower Louifiaua. f
This last motive is also offered as a rea- t
fonwhy the runningof the bouudary line is ' *
postponed ; as all their attention was drawn j r
towards the defence of the province, againd (
an invasion which, as I have already diown, r
was never contemplated t
To all these faAs, I have to add the de- c
â  claration of General Wilkinfon, in his letter , J
of June 2d, to the Secretary of Warâ" Ij i
1 have (fays he) information through a confi- ! 1
dential channel, that it was determined as ; ]
early as September lad, not to give up the ;
â  pods on the Mississippi." If this informa- j 1
tion be correA, no other proof is necessary to
shew that all the reasons from time to time |
fuggeded for not evacuating the posts were 1
, mere pretences. 1
1 KÂ»v c brought into one view the <
mod material fafts relating to the quedion
between us, which are scattered through
- out the reports made by me to the President
of the United States on the 10th of June
1 and 3d July, and by the Secretary of War
- on the 30th of June, and the documents
1 accompanying them, as Jthey haTe been pub
- lifhed. And from this brief recital it evi
dently appears, as I have said in my report,
t " That the Governors of his Catholic Ma
-1 jedy, on the Miffifippi, have, on various
- pretences, podponed the running of the
1 boundary liÂ»c, and the withdrawing of his
- troop* from the posts they occupied within
e the territory of the United States : And
- that after repeated overtures, promises, and
. appearances of commencing the execution
e of the treaty between the two nations, in
e both these rtfpe&s, their conduA demoo
r ftrates, that for an indefinite period they
k meant to avoid doing either."
y You controvert this conclusion only on
d one ground- You fay that the treaty stipu
lated merely that the Spanish garrifous should
t be withdrawn, not that fortifications which
:f might one day be prejudicial to the King's
e fubjefls, fliould be delivered up : and hence
e you infer that the necsffity urged by the two
) governors of delaying to withdraw thÂ« gar
d nfons.until this quedion is decided between
0 the two Governors, is not a pretence, but a
â¢- fubdantial reason. Here I mud observe
if that the governors had already demolished
e the pod at the Chickafaw Bluff : And it
f- appears in the foregoing recital that they
were going to demolish the pod at the Wal
r. nut Hills: and the reason afligned is that
â d the treaties with the Indians required the
1, demolition: and governor Gayofo assigns
C- bnt one motive for fiifpending that operati
:e onâthat he had been informed of the un
ie fetttled disposition of the Indians ; yet af
terwards this reason (that their treaties with
r- the Indians required the demolition of the
h pods) is forgotten, asd their deftru&ion,
d or their delivery with all the fortifications
bt and other works standing, is by the gover
if. nors made to depend entirely on the issue of
iy a negociation between the governments of
e- Spain and the United States ! Can any far
?d ther proof be wanting to juftify me in cal
he ling this aprttence ? But you seem to rely
at on this your conftrudlion of the treaty rela
li- tive to the posts : You have urged it in your
he letter to me- ps the 24th of June ; and there
til fore I will consider it.
it- The 2d article of the Treaty having def
at cribed the boundaries between the territo
-Ift ries of the United States and Spain, thus
proceeds â" And it is agreed that if there
te should be any troops, garrison* or fettle
-1 ; ments of either party, in the territoiy of
at the other, according to the above mention
re ed boundaries, they shall be withdrawn from
sir the said territories within the term of fix
he months after the ratification of this treaty,
n- or sooner if it be poffihle : and that they
re shall be permitted to take wittythem all the
;es goods and effefts which they possess." But
lin to juftify your retention of the posts, you
ts, fay that the demarcation of the boundary
:s: line should precede the withdrawing of the
â¢ ,
gajyifons : Yet you suppose xlpraba'J.c and ' we
his Catholic Majesty's governors 'well knciv, j muc
that the Chickafaw Bluffâthe Walnut hills \Ew
-râ and the Natchez are within the territory be <
of the United State*. woi:
Governor GÂ«yofo fpeaka ofthe boundary of ii
line as being near Clarkefville, a place many fuel
miles below the Natchez ; and he also knew 1
the result of Mr. Ellicott's astronomical ob- caul
fervations on the spot, which ascertained whi
the Natchez to be about thirty nine miles, tior
north of the south boundary of the United the
States. mat
There being then not a shadow of doubt tior
with refpeft to the position of these portsâ 1
that they are all within the territory of the adv
United States, there was no necessity pre- kno
vioufly to run and mark the boundary line : the
which besides, if set about in good earnest, bles
it would take at least a year to accomplish, out
through a wilderness of many hundred miles you
in extent; and therefore it never could have I
been contemplated as necessary to precede our
the evaAiation of the polls, which was to are
be effected in fx months, or sooner if poffille. trie
Yet fifteen months have elapsed, and you
still keep possession. To
But you fugged that it is at least doubt
ful whether by the treaty it was intended
to leave the fortification* (landing, when
the garrisons should be withdrawn: .You whi
fay " It is not to be presumed that it could imj
ever have been the intention of his catholic the
majesty to deliver up fortifications, which, ha*
besides that they have eoft him confidera- flat
Ble sums of money, may, by the. effeft of Ye
political vicissitudes, be one day prejudicial mil
to his fubje&s." I feel much reluftance to Th
attempt the refutation of a conftruftion so tifc
obviously erroneous. It is probably the thi
fir it time that to " withdraw" or retire from no'
a place has been imagined to intend its de-> of
fruition. If at the formation of the treaty or
the demolition of the pods had been intend- pii
ed, it would assuredly have been expressed. sea
But doubtlef* the idea never occurred, un- vel
til it was found convenient to make it a tw
pretence for holding the pods. The phrases
" to withdraw a garrifdn," to evacuate a by
fofl or country, have as determinate a mean- i uni
ing as any in the English language ; and tio
their meaning is ascertained .by frequent use ; lar
: in treaties ; and to defiroy a country or a A
fortified plac, from which it was dipulated ' wt
to " withdraw" an army or a garrison, in
i ' would be such an a& of barbavifm as ought ini
i ; never to take place among civilized natioris. | to
t One of the lated treaties made by the U- ch
, 1 nitod States (that with Great Britain) has te
the fame phraseâ" His majedy will 'with- ha
- dra-w all his troops and garrisons from all w!
r posts and places within the boundary lines gi
[ j assigned by the treaty of peace to the U- pt
- ! nited States. This evacuation (hall take a
s place on or before the fird day of June, of
e i 1796." And these expressions are used in ec
- the fame treaty as equivalent to " the deli I
0 ! very of the said pods." The 'British treaty tl
e was in this manner accordingly carried into w
e effeflâthe British troops were -withdrawn, re
and the works left flaniing. The British m
e officers were even careful not to expose the p]
1 works to accidental deftruftion : for as the p ;
i- American troops did not reach the pods by
t the fird of June, small British guards were tr
e left to preserve the works from injury until a i
r the American troops arrived,

r- A POLITICAL~REFLECTION. \
â¢ u Every country has certain peculiar advan- Â®'
a tages, which, like remarkable features, dif- j,
ve tinguifh it from others. In the earlier dates
-d of foeiety, these were entirely natural or t
't local, as the fitnefs of the foil fbr particu- v
c y lar predu&ions, or the convenience of situ- Â£
'1- ation for certain pursuits : afterwards fa3i- t
at tious advantages were added, the result of Â£
accident or application ; commerce, manu- t
n * faftures, modes of government, and various c
ti- other effe&s of human exertion or providen- (
tial disposal, contributed to diverfify nati- (
onal character nearly in the fame proportion (
th with the complexions and manners of the
he human race.
in i From an early acquired habit of contem- '
â¢n* plating with pleasure those objefts in which j
er_ his own country is superior to others, the ,
native imbibes the amor patria, the spirit i
Â°f of patr'wtifm, which attaches him so drong- 1
ar ~ ly to his native foil that fomethir.g extraor
:al" dinary mud occur to induce him to leave
-'y it without relu&ance, and something dill
'' a * more extraordinary if he can entirely with
)Ur draw his affeftions from it.
re- Â«' Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind."
It is this which induces a man to hazard
>ef- his all for that country which early pleasures
to- and long habit have endeared to himt
ius To difqover these advantages, and pro
ere perly to edimate and apply them, is the
;le- nohleft pursuit of the politician : and with
of us it is unnecessary to dispute whether such
on- and such facts or opinions are British or
om French, Chinese or Tartarean ? but whether
fix they may be made ufeful to America ?
ty, The charafteriftie advantages of America
ley are, its wide didance from Europe, its in
the dependence so remarkably acquired, and
iut ' its early political experience. Divided by
rou â¢ the width of the Atlantic from the red of
ary ' the civilized world, we little to fear
the j froÂ» their open force or secret intrigues, if
we take clre not to betray cur/thai- Sa
much trouble Imd expense would attend'an
European invaflon, so little hope would there
be of success by force, and so much time
would be neeeflary for carrying on a system
of intrigue, that America can be ruined by
such means but with her owa consent.
The history of oifr revolution, and the
causes which produced it, and the glory
which crowned it, are a source of exulta
tion to the American, and have received '
the admiration of the old world, who esti
mated our character by our fuccefsful exer
tions at that important period.
As a nation, we have the unparalleled
advantage of beginning with a fund of
knowledge, which others have purchased at
the expense of centuries of blood and trou
bles. We have the experieace of age with
out its infirmitiesâwe have the freffinefs of
youth without its inexperience.
In these refpe&s we may justly prefer
our country to the reft of the world : these
are the circumftanees which juftify the pa
triotism of America.
To lie Editor of the Virginia Argui.
Richmond, O&ober 4, 1797.
Sir,
The ufeful and iiiterefting matter with
which your paper is always filled, makes it
improper, perhaps, to expeft or alk of you,
the re-publication of any essays which may
have appeared in other papers of' you* own
ftatej much less those of your own city
Yet, the anxiety which 1 1 have heard a
number of your fubferibers, who do not talpe
The Virginia Gazette and General Adver
tiser express, to fee the papers published in
that Gazette under the signature which I
now write, induces me to acquit mvfelf
of the charge of partiality for the fubferibers
or friends to any particulai newspaper, by
publilhing in yours, some of the leading
features of the NINE numbers of the De
velopment of the causes of the dijlurbances be
tween the .American ajd French Republics.
This I am impelled the riuore ftrohgly to,
by another consideration in addition to. the
I one already stated. Besides the equal atten
tion I with to ftiew to your fubferibers at
; large, with those of every other paper in
â  America, there is one person in particular,
whose name has been frequently mentioned
; in those papers, and who, I am credibly
; informed, declared (tho' with a bhi/l, lam
told, of modefl innocence, I presume, on his
cheek) to a citizen of his own county, af
ter the publication of the 7th No. that " he
had never seen one of those publications
who, if there was no other entitled to he
gratified, certainly of himfelf is. That the
â  person alluded to, v niay no longer be without
' a fight of what I have already {kid and tho't
p of him (as he is the last of all men I would
' eoncfal those fentinrents and opinions from)
I Ihall therefore now draw up a summary of
' the prlncipil things I have of him',
> \yidr the addition of a fey more which yet
> remain to be touched upon,, and which in
1 my opinion, it behoves that person to ex
; plain: And this I fliall do. for the moil
part, by the way of as that
r appears to be the favorite way of arriving at
" truth, with some of that person's advocates
1 and friends.
By the ingenious invention of the sfvrcrct
- which may justly be styled the enemies of
t faabinfm put to the rack, we are taught
1 to propound a few ufeful querict on the other
t fide; a few candid answers to which will v'e
r ry much aid the qucrift and Editor of that
> ufeful paper in' arriving at truth on the fub
c ject of his enquires. By as ready and as
fatisfa&ory answers being made, as were asÂ»
- forded on that occasion, itÂ»mav be seen, who,
' 'and what paaty, are best prepared to pass
- the fiercy ordeal of such a torturous examina
-0 ; atian as has been there set on foot.
e | In the firft place then, Mr. Pleafants, to
I- pursue and be consistent with my original
i* : plan, who, give ml leave to a(k, was our
k | ambafTador in France, when their revolution
s i I broke out, and our general government wit

for adoption or rejeflion, recommending cer
tain things to be done which were not done, or
paid .any very.great attrition to ?
3d Had that negleit and theprrfumptien of
the people of America to form a government for
themselves, in bit aifcnce, and in contempt of his
~ advice, any, and what effifl, on hisfecret opin
ions and dispositions towards that government ?
:s 4th How did it happen that an attachment
>r to the cause of France (of which that charaiter
j_ was well knowu to be a warm admirer) became
connected with, and underf ood to be iufeparable
from, an ennjity to our government ; and that
the person who had been the chief cause of the a
-3t doption of the government, and was well known
j- to be under the influence of tue amhaffador, be
jS come immediately on his, return to America, so
ftrangcly changed, as to become among the fore
moft in those filter principles of a friendship to the
caufc of France and enmity to the American gov

of fhe-Hnited State*, in which those schemes of

This very amiable senator on his vny to congrcft j

the othir, supposed by him, from certain striking ;
circÃmftÂ»nces, ro be a warm and decided adv cate 1
for the of Mr. Jefferfon "He hoptd," ,
" the latter gentleman had been doing ev- (
cry thing in his power toenfure< "e eleiftion of his
frieud Mr. Jefferfon as president ; that he had fe- 1
cured for htm all the votes in his state ; and th.it if
he was not'elected, he would make America Jkike
to berfoHrd.ition." Mr. Jefferfon we wtU know, j
was not ele&ed president. How Mr. Blount was
to make America Jtaie to ber foundation, and for
what, let this declaration, now added to that of
Du Pont de Ne'mours ; the exertions of Mr. Adet
and Blount to the fame objeft in the election of a

Whether this cÂ«nfeflion of Mr. Blount, made
at that particular fiage of the business ought to
attraÂ£> the notice of the committeecharged with
an enquiry into every circumitancc attending the

and that is, the author of thefe'publications hold

Whatever, now offers, that if those who he con
ceives have injured thrit country in shat way,
and are har? pointed as, will condescend to come
forward and anlwer such questions as are here
put, and within their power to answer, he will,
00 his part, assume a more v.flble appearance,
and pledges himfelf to substantiate every thing

es the principles of democracy and equality,lhould
holdhiinl'elf alonffrom the inquiries of the people

On Sunday evening lajl, between 6 and 7. 0'
clock we experienced a violent gale of wind
from the weflward, attended with heavy rain
and thunderâThe damage done in this town
was not great compared abith that done at Eajl-
Haven and Branfordâthe roofs of some build
ings were injured, the tops of chimneys blown off
and windows blown in, some trees aad fences
blown down, and a barn in the Newtoumfhip
removed from its foundation. / t Eafl-llavcn
the Reeple of the meeting house was blown down, j
which, fairing on the roof, brtie through the
fide where it fell, leaving anly one rofterJ,land
ing and penetrating to the floor greatly damaged
the feats. A large house was removed from ltd
foundation, several dwelling houses werepartlf
and others entirely unroofed, a number of barns
met the fame fate! One large barn was j entire- ;
ly denwlifhed, the materials of which it was
built feat ter'd in every direction. The town oj
Brarferd experienced nearly the fame fate,
part of the roof of the meeting-house was blown
off, and til the windows on the weflern hde,
deflr-oyedâ6 or 7 houses, a newjore, andfeve
ral barns unroofed, other barns blown down,
the trees in several fine orchards laid proflrate.
\fhe height of the tornado continued but a few

CITIZFNS OF NriV-rORK.
While you are travelling along the road
ofbufincfs and pleasure, turn aside like the
good Samaritan of old and pour oil and wine
into the. \vound3 of your fuffering brethren
in Philadelphia. Although the bills of
mortality exhibit fewer deaths this year than
in 1793, yet one principal reason is, the
more general desertion of the city, and we
understand allbufinefsis suspended. Think,
fellow-citizens, what distress mud await the
numerous poor of a great city, who arc de
prived, for three months, of all employment.
In 1795, the citizens of Philadelphia gene
rously sent to the mayor of New-York 6000
dollars for the relief of tire poor j although
our diftrefles were trifling compared with
those of Philadelphia ; three fourths of our
city was free from the pestilence, and fix
sevenths of its inhabitants were pursuing
their occupations. Surely the citizens of
! NeVf-York, who have, this season Tcarcely
known sickness, among them, will not, in
prosperity, forget their fuffering brethren,
j By the report of General Ton (Taint Loy
-1 verture, it appears that Santhonax has long
! been attempting to detach Hifpaniola from
! its dependence on France, and has used e
i very effort to debauch ToufTaint from his
! allegiance. Santhonax, an abandoned villain,
who has enriched himfelf on the plunder of
the unfortunate colonists who were too hon
efl to join him in his villainies, would doubt
less wish to throw himfelf out of the reach of
the French government, and make himfelf
the petty despot of that island. But if he
supposed he could maintain the indepen
dence of that colony, in opposition to the
power of France, he is as weak as he is wick
ed.
The constituted authorities of the French
government or rather despotism in St. Do
mingo, confided of a motley crew. San
thonax, born in France where he has a fa
ther (till living. Raimond, a mulattoâand
Touffaint, a black man, military commander
in Chief. It appears however that these
officers who have African blood in their
veins, are infinitely the least criminal. Rai
mond and Touiffant are spoken of, by the
Americans, as men of more honor apd inte
grity than Santhonaxâand men on whose
word some dependence can be placed.
Since Santhonax was sent away, the su
preme authority in St. Domingo devolves on
Julien Raimond, This man has ifTued a
pompous proclamation, addressed to the
people, in which he declares his attachment
and inviolable faith to the French republicâ
That as he has both French and African
blood in his veins, the real French and the
people of other colours have nothing to
fear from himâall shall be prote&ed in their
rights. He fays that he has constantly en
deavoured to foften down the resentments
of the different partiesâto calm animoli
ties and to inspire a love of labour, of order,
and of peaceâto revive cultivation, which
alone can bring back prosperity. In this
he has so far succeeded, as he Hates, that
the plantations in the north of the island
have refumecj a smiling afpeft and become
productive. He promises to redlify the
enormous abuses introduced into the im
ports by Santhonax, whofc dlftribution of
the public money was fhamefully unequal &
unjust.
In this proclamation, Raimond has said
nothing in particular about the American
trade. He fays in general that " The
French merchants and Jlrangers are wit
nefles of the protection given to commerce
. and of the efforts of the adminiflration to
fulfil its engagements." He speaks of his
â  ardent desire to unite all the inhabitants in
one family and attach them to Franceâand
also to encourage cultivation, profeÃ com
merce and coufolidate the general prosperity.
How far there is sincerity in these pro
feffions, time will shew.
' SAVANNAH, September 23.
i We learn from the Havanna, that Santho
-1 nax arrived there, about the ift of this

The distribution of the public grant has th
hitherto been without that caution which I ta
expected. poor are gathered to the pr
Jieart of the city from all quarters, and pro- th
bably from, those houses where the sickness 01
rages : those persons mingle with others, so
and we cannot deny that the contagion by w
this means is transferred from house to iv
house in every direftion. Perhaps the dt
minds of the commiflioners being dire&ed te
to the main objeft, has prevented their th
adoption of some plan whicn would fully th
answer trfie design of the grant, and also of gi
the numerous donations for the support of dt
the a/Sifted. V
Some plan, as follows, would be attend- re
ed with many advantages: fy
ThÂ« Board being comprized of perfens ju
from varioiiÃ quarters of the city, let a cer- w
tain diftritt be afligned to each ; let the te
poor in that diftridt apply to him only, and ti
his care reach to those only who are certi- g<
'fied as belonging to that part of the city, tl
This would enable the commifiioners to ex- re
ecute their business with dispatch, which g
, would be attended with manifold advantages h
. ko, the objefts of the public bounty, and n
-1 more readily prevent the spreading of thf e'
/ contagion. I tl
ONE OF THE PEOPL# rr
Translated for the Salem Gaiettefrom a Ip- J
ris paper of the 28th of June. J I 1(
On the rage for Republicaniling and Muni- f c
cipalifing all around us. f,
When the French revolution firft' began, t ,
mar;y honest men, facrificing their personal t )
intereft'to justice, and their paflionsto truth, a ]
devoted themselves courageoufiy to the ha- f,
tred of a crowd of implacable enemies, and
followed with a zeal the new apostles of li- , p
berty. They firmly believed that the war ! a:
which was about to take place would be a ; t]
j war of principles again ft prejudices, morali- ,f,
ty against intrigue, of love of country against : (]
love of riches and privileges, of laws against j Â£
arbitrary power, and offweet tempered phi- t ]
lanthropy against intriguing and winding f,
policy. They hoped that "Trance would w
soon fee all citizens judged by the fame f,
laws, and promoted without diftinflion, to y
those employments which their merit would {]
render them worthy of ; that the criminal
code, foftened, would offer a certain pro- r
te&ion to innocence, and punifliments pro- ti
portioned to every crime ; that the taxes n
lessened, would be equally distributed ; and
that unjust ways of ambition and vanity,
would never take place, to create disorder in
the finances, languifhment in commence, ste
rility in the fields, and mourning in fami
-5 lies. The constituent aflembly had establish-
J ed, in principle, that France, contented
with its limits, renounced formally all ideas j
of conqneft ; and this noble and wife de- a
claration was fufficient to secure to us the
_ good wishes of all people, the friendthip of
all pacific governments, and to enable us to t
j. aft the glorious part of arbiters and peace-
maimers of Europe. How much has this Â£
â¢ L sweet hope been fruftrated. The abolish- k
" ment of lettres de cachet was wished, and _
France is filled with Baftiles ; a humane cri
' minal code was deiired, and the Repuolic
has been covered with"ftaffolds, and inun
dated with blood ; moderate taxes were ex- |
S peÂ£ted, and all'property has been violated,
invaded, dilapidated ; exclusive privileges _
were destroyed, but the Jacobins have form
-s cd new fefts who have usurped all power.â
re Commerce and agriculture thought, t nat, <
r " released from their ancient (hackles, they j
,e fhiuld arrive to the highest degree of prof- I
1 perity ; but the taxes, the pro-confuis, the '
le revolutionary laws, the afiigiiats, the stock
jobbers, have exhausted and almost del
troyed, these sources of thenational riches.
Finally ; after having pulled down these
>m Reuolutionary Tyrants, and proscribed
e * their infernal system ; after having conquer
- ed all the kings leagued against us ; France
whose vidlories had secured her the power
of dictating to Europe the conditions of
j peace, still hoped that its government, can
j du&ed by legillatorj freely eledled, would.
; return to their true principles of moderation
â  and jufticr, a:>d ftcure to us the enjoyment
ie- of a b Idling so dearly puichnfed ; th it,' hav
ing so juiliy condemned the thrt
won Id have interfered in our ennfUtutign,
! v.'e fhouid be so wife ourselves as not .to med
die in the aiiaivs of other governments ; aad '
that, profiting by the peace of Europe, we
fliouid lay the foundation of solid peace,' cou
-4.6 tenting ourselves with moderate and just in
-4 demnities, and leaving to none, in this res
â peÂ£l, that mortification and resentment ,
50 which change *peace into a truce, and pre
pare for terrible vengeance to come. And
I yet; by an inconceivable fatality, this hope
49 is (lilL.difappointed ; our revolutionary de
liriurft is which subsiding within, Sgitatvs
us more than ever without ; the genius of
jacobinism, in abandoning the rein j of our
6 , interior adminillration, feerns to have possess
ed itfelf of our exterior politics ; and they
might fay, by way of consolation for the
6 truce which they were obliged to ccaifent
to, that we were determined to overthw the
universe.
We might excuse ourselves for having in
vaded and pillaged Italy.; war is a transient
violation of the laws of justice. The obsti
nacy of our enemies ; the abundance of pe
cuniary means that London furnifhed to Vi
ccl enna ; our penury ; the necessity of putting
ns, nn end to the war by great efforts, and fplen
re- did vi&ories ; all rnayjuftify us ; and Buo
gh naparte has, in this refpeft, by his valor,
:he his adlivity, his genius, realized, and even
in- fu'rpaffed our moil fanguir.e hopes ; and
ho when ofi his way to Vienna, in order to force
ter the emperor to make peace, he probably
rts favored some infurreclions, which secured
or- his communications, and which, durinp- hi*
â¢ ' O
the perilous and triumphant march,4cft no dan
air ger behind him.
But when peace has followed viftory ;
!, when there isexpedtedof us asmuchfrankncfs
"in negociation, as we have displayed valor iu
battle ; when we can offer, as conquerors,
fufficient compenCations, why to the
mod contemptible duplicity ? Why excite
infiu in order to punifli, afterwards,
has those against whom we diredl them ? Why
h I talk of the will of the people, when the
the presence of our bayonet 3 deprives them of
>ro- the power of expressing it freely ? Why
tefs overthrow neutral governments, after having
er3, so long profited by their neutrality ? If we
by would be the conquerors of these people,
to why talk to them of repuhlicanifm and in
the dependence ? If ye wifii them to become
iled Republicans, and independent, why speak to
aeir them as amafter, give them orders, name to
jlly them, imperatively, municipalities, direftors,
>of generals? Why defpotife freemen ? Why
. of deceive weak and pacific governments ?
Why mark all our steps with desolations and
nd- revolutions? Shall we never feel that such a
' system is as contrary to found policy as to
"ens justice ; that it juftifies in some measure,
:.er- what has been, and what may yet be, at
the tempted to overthrow our ->6wn conftitu
and tion ; that it diffitisfies and incenses all
:rti- governments against us, and may cause
ity. them to unite with our enemies; that it
ex- renders uncertain the peace which we are
lich going to make since the resentments which
iges have nouriihed the war are like to become
and more universal and more violent than they
thf ever have been? And if we will be deaf to
the voice of justice, and to the language of
moderation, (hall we never perceive that it
is not prudent for the Gauls to refucitatethe
Romans; and that it is not wife to give to
neighbours a mode of existence vvhichexcites
uni " so much energy, which creates in a moment
, | such ftro'ng armies, and condudtsfo tapidly
, 3 "> to victory? The Jacobins already boast of
bnal the forces that, are preparing for them, they'
already glory in the new country which is
' la " founding for them in Italy; already, count-
ing on their numerous partisans in the south
| provinces, they publi/h, with as much joy
w:ir as imprudence, thehope of returning here,
be a ! thunder in hand, to seize again their fright
rail" | fill power, and to immolate, without pity,
linft 1 the viftims devoted to their iniernol fury.'
nnft Diredlory! tear off the bandage with which
phi- the paflionsblind you; open youj eyes! con
hug fult-thc wife policy of the new colleague
inld whom the public voice has given you! and,
ame following counfe's more prudent, secure

linal f a long tormented by sophists without expe
pro- rience, ambitious men without controul, and

the partnerihip which hat fÂ«r some time fub

William Oeer, it now difTolved: but, not as M.
Slough inflnuatesto the public without just cause ;
as will more fully appear by a letter on the fub

December last. a recital of which is not now deem
ed necefTary. Any gentleman who wiflies to be.
more cireumftantially informed of the merit* of

the perusal sf M/Slough's letter, and then can be
at full liberty to determine whether or not W.
Geer is not perfe&ly juftifiable in attaching him
felf to any other person in the prosecution of the
Stage conveyance from Philadelphia to Shippenf- 1

Now from tbe liberal and generous fnpport the '

this business, VI illiam Geer, in conjuniftion with
MelTrs. Reiiy, Weed and Witmer, is determined j
toprofecute and carry it on, with every care, at
tention anddifpatch that a zeal to oblige the pub

The ajiove company, who are amply provided t
with carriages, horses, and every appurtenance to l
render the passage fafe and rommodious, inform
those wno wilh to patronize and eneourage the n
