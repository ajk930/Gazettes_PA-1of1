and
rural ECONOMY. a^-c
The cheapness of land in this country
gives a great advantage to our produce in. anc
foreign markets, which balances ill a great
meifure the high price of labour. On th*
contrary, European grain and meat go dear bg
to market, because land is there very high,
though the wages of labour are low. But >f
our agriculture and manufactures cannot gt;
profit to the full extent of tb;s advantage,
while fuel is so dear. In.England, coal is
cheaper than fire wood in this town. ihe r
scarcity of fuel is therefore an obflacle to
the growth of American improvement,
vhich will stint %nd dwarf every thing
that our hopes have anticipated, unless Come ca
remedy can be found out. Coal mines, if M
discovered, would be a national blefling
and treasure. To make our roads turn- H
and our riversÂ»navigable for rafts and y
boats, woitld do a great deal of good by
conveying with ease and cheapness the fuel
from places where it cumbers the land, to
places where the inhabitants are fhiveruig
for the want of it ; and where, it may be c<
added, manufacturers are deterred from set- c _
tljcp- for fear thai they (hall freeze. The h
at c.f tv.rf or peat common in Ireland,
r.nd it is said to be abundant in quantity, Â£
excellent in its kind, in many parts of n
this viciiiity. Much of it is dug at Meno- c
tomy in Cambridge and in Lexington. Our c
bogs should be exploredâwood iÂ» however {
so much preferred, that nothing else will be j
generally made nfe of. Economy in burn- Ij,
fng wood is an immense resource. More {
was toafied fifty years ago than is now want- f
ed.âStoves, smaller fire-places, warmer t
houses, more care in mending broken panes ]
of glass, and fnutting doors, are ways to {
snake less wood answer ; and we live by (
, tbefe means as warm in our houses as our (
prpdigal forefathers did in theirs. , ,
To all this may be added the oare pur ;
farmers have taken of late to fence the
wood lots from the cattle. Tn this single (
town, the cattle turned out to browze in {
the spring have, within the last thirty years,
prevented more wood from growing, than â 
would have paid two or three fold the value
of the pasturing of tliefe tree-destroying
fteefs and heifers. What would farmers
fay of a man who should turn hi; cows and
oxen in June into his corn-field ? Proba
bly the young cattle do more mifchief in
May to the unfeneed or badly fenced sorest
trees. Cattle at large are a nuisance.
Would it not be a regulation well deserv
ing the attention of the general court, to
require every town to plant the fides oi the
public roads with for-A trees,
â¢< Trtm forms a Jbtltcr, anj from btat a JtaJc."
How matiy cords of wood might thus
grow in 30 or 40 years ? Let our political
economics calculate the length of all our
roads, the number of trees and the quantity
of wood. Any computation, fair and un
fair, would result in proving the wisdom of
such a regulation. Posterity would be proud
of it, and thankful for it too.
Surely, in point of ornament and ufeful
- ness it would vie with the law requiring guide
posts, which every body approves.
The planting quick growing trees, as
willow, Lombardy poplar, balm of Gilead,
&c. certainly deserves attention. ' Even the
elms, ash trees, button woods and maples 1
wili pay for planting by their growth 5 and
on the borders of fields their shade probably
does as much good as harm. ,
The fubjea is of deep concern to the
public. The refourees for favir.g and mr
creafmg fuel, mentioned above, may beSuf
ficient for our present numbers. But if we
hope to thrive in arts and manufactures, and
increase in numbers, our legislature mud pay

The President of the United States, hav- H

on Thursday the 9th day of November, neitl
and the troop 3of cavalry, wbofe fortunate quo!
situation has put it in their power to pay fort
tl'at refpeft which is due to the exalted fla- j Ext,
tion, worthy character, and approved con- j
dust of the chief magiflrate of the United 1
States, by cheerfully agreeing to escort him a fl;
through the State of New Jersey, dn his go- age
ing to the feat of government, and having for
at the fame time expressed their wifli that I j C/"
should give them due notice when and where I 1
they should attend to execute this voluntary | one
and pleasing duty of citisen soldiers, and not
also the necefTary inftru&ions to perform the son
fame, it is therefore with equal cheerfulnefs I ry <
and pleasure, that I now embrace the car- frei
lieft opportunity of complying therewith.
The following arrangements I conceive will tor
be proper and molt accommodating to the I fha
troops of cavalry which will hare the honor 1
of escorting the President of the United me
State# through the state. The troops near- a r
eft to the President's route will be thÂ« fol
lowing, viz. Major Meeker's of the Bergen rai
squadron, Major Ward's and Hayne's of wl
the EfTex squadron. Capt. Edgar and Ma- I
jor Dunham's of tfte Middlesex squadron, pu
capt. Gulick'sof the Somerset squadron, and to
- capt. Smith's of the Hunterdon squadron. to
Major Meekw's troop will therefore be in an
readiness to receive the President at Powle's j ex
, Hook on the day he leaves the City of New- irr
York, of which he must get the moll cer- I r
I tain information, and cfcort him to New- I p
ark Bridge, where Major Ward's troop j
' will receivs and escort him to Elizabeth I r
I Town, where capt. Hayne's troop will re- I .
e ceive and escort him to Woodbridge, where re
capt. Edgar's troop will reÂ«eive and escort "
c him to New-Brunfwick ; on leaving which L
' place, he will be escorted by Major Dun
\ ham's troop to Kingston, where he will be I
I received by capt. Gulick's troop, and ef- I
corttd tp Maidenhead, where he will be re-
II ceived and escorted by capt. Smith's troop j
" l 1 to Trenton.
' e I As the following military honours art on- j
l " ! ly due to the chief magiflrate of the United I
re States, they ate inserted for the information
t_ of fuchof the officers as may not recolleft
er them. Each troop when they receive the
" President, must be poffefled of the squadron .
to flandard, for which purpose when there are
'Y two troops from the fame squadron, the ftan- |
Jr dard bearer of the escorting troop must ride i
ahead when he comes in fight of the receiv
ur ing troop, and deliver the standard to the i
! e proper officer. On receiving the President,
the troop must be drawn up in one line, in 1
ln such a situation that the President may pass |

iefame' the most eautious feerecy continues to be

sots. can alone supply the want of authentic m-
telligence on this interefling occasion, some
of the Paris journah venture to assert, on
the authority of a vague report, that the
negotiations are now at a ftdnd. ,
We are are assured from the best authori
ty, that the Chevalier D'Ahneida the Por
tuguese envoy, in his late interview with
the cabinet ministers, hpd given the most po
sitive assurance, that the Portuguese cabi
net, in all their negociations, would pre
serve inviolate the treaties exiting with
Great-Britain ; Mr. Walpole has alio re
ceived from the cabinet of Lisbon unequivo
cal proofs of entering into no terms dero
gatory to thir connexions with this country.
Letters from Madrid, of the 3d instant,
mention the national finances to be in a state
of the greatest embarrafiment. The new
minister was about to negoctate a loan i>f
one hundred millions of rials. The court
having prolonged their residence in the cap
ital beyond their accuftosned time, left it
the Ift for St. Ildephonfo-. The prince. of
peace has received some frefh instances of
the of his sovereign. The Span
iards speak with rtiuch confidence of the
fafety of Cadiz from any future attempts of
the British fleet.
The El Rofario Spanish prize brig, cf
18 guns, commanded by lieut. Hubert, is
arrived at Portsmouth, with dispatches from
Gibraltar, and also from Earl St. Vincent,
who remains off Cadiz with the fleet,. app3- -
rently meditating fre(h attempts by sea and
land.
1 At Gibraltar they at length have indica
' tions from what passes within the Spanish
â  lines, that the Dons mean soon to annoy
' them, as they are*building frefh-monar bat
" teries, and collecting ammunition, on which
) occaficm the ftaff is removing from the town
' to the south, preparatory to operations.â

, INAUGURAL DISSERTATION
on the bilious malignant fever ;â|
read at a public examination, before the Re f.
Joseph Willard, S. T. D. L. L. D.
president ; by , Samuel Broitn, A. M.â
Publijhed Augvfl, 1797., Manning cS* Lor
ing, Bojlon.
" The putrirl lteains of fame-corroding venom,
'n conmlcfj pores, o'er a'i the pervious lkin
ImMbV, soon poison the balfimic blood,
And rn>ife tbr heart to ev -ry fever's rap'. "
THE author commences his dissertation
by observing that, " in Augjift 1796, the
town of Boftoa was vilited by a contagious
diftafe of unusual malignancy, the circum
ftanccs and marks of which were fuel} as
threatened great calamity ; arid the alarm
spread, and became almost universal. This
still increased ; on that in many
of its symptoms it bore great refevnblance
to the fever which had so recently raged at
Philadelphia and New-York."
The author then mentions 'what diseases
were moll prevalent previous to and at the
commencement of this fever; but unfortn
nately has given us no information of the state
of the atmosphere ; whether it was pure and
wholesome, containing much oxygene ; or
hot and depressing to the ftrcngth, contain
ing much azote. Though in a fubfeqiwnt
part of the work he observes, " which,
therefore, of the above principles (oxygene
or azote) has the greatest share in the pTo
duftion of diseases, will not be decided, un
til some flandard, or gafmetre, shall be in
vented, by which it can be known what is
the ptculiar state of the atmosphere when
they prevail.
Some observations on poisons follow,
which might have b?en omitted, as they con
j tain nothing new ; and he candidly confeffes
| that most of tbem " have long been ac
knowledged by the best mfdical writers."
The description of the fever is brief, but
fuffieiently charafterillic, to distinguish it,
and with that accuracy which mark but
few.
Proximate caufe âhe observes, is morbid
effluvia, firft lodged in the saliva ; thence
conveyed and lodged in the stomach and in
teftiries ; here, either perverting or totally
destroying the d'igellive powers of these
cera, thereby a putrid and highly corrosive
mass is generated inftea'd of a mild and bland
substance to give nourlfhment to animal life.
The fiu-rounding blood veflels feel the change
and are affefted ; the whole fy(lem is cate
nated with these irregular mottoes, when :
lite, unable to withstand so irregular an at
tack, yields itfelf a viftim. j
That the disease makes its approach by
the saliva, he thinks is evident, from per- J
sons complaining of tailing the putrid exha- '
lations a long time after being nigh an in- ;
ft-fted fubjeft. A moll elegant sentence !
closes these observations. " The alimentary
-canal may be called the storehouse of conta
gion. Here, like the fkilful but cautious
enemy, it commences Its operations by pro
greffivdy invading I He- wAker parts unlit
t.te inncrmoft fortress of lifc are endanger
ed." \ Â°

dileafe, and we are not indebted to India
nor 'any foreign port for this commodity.
From the many quotations it inay be seen
that the author's stile is energetic, his.deduc- â¢
tions welt drawn, and his treatment, that
which has proved mod efficacious in those
parts of the United States and Weft-Indies
where this tyrannic fever has ere&ed its

vVALPOLE, (N. Hi) O&ober 16.
The public review, by regiments, of the
troops, compofmg the fifth brigade of the
New H?.mpfh : re militia, was completed last
Tnur.day at Qlciremont. We are happy to
learn, that the martial fpirlts of the fol-'
diery, by foreign indignities, aided
by the aÂ£Hve exertions of brigadier general
Allen, and encouraged in fevcral in-'hrices
by the prefencc of the major genera], ex
hibited in turn a very pleasing specimen of
military improvement. This brigade now
furnilhes seven troops of cavalry and twelve
companies of light all completely
officered, equipped ar.d uniformed; and
capable, with scarcely an exception, of per
lorming the extrcife and evolutions of the
camp with reputable exacincfs. It is not
invidious to remark, that the display of
military difeipline of the twelfth regiment,
Mnder the command of col. Gardner, would
not have disgraced a corps of organized've
terans.
Gentlemen paflengers in the latest reffels
from London, report most favourably con
cerning the polity, manufaftures, arts and
literature of England. An. amiable mo.
narch, a loyal people, a flourifhing com
merce, an admirable conftltution, all, all
give the lie to those fools, or those knaves,
who pronounce Britain in her decadence.
She writes vici on her shields, and her in
vincible fleets sweep every French and Sp3-
nifli cobweb from the ocean.
It is curious to compare the nautical
journals of French and British marine be
haviour.âWhen one of our Vessels is en
countered by his Britannic majesty's frigates
or merchantmen, the American captain inva
riably records in his log-book that he was po
litely treated. But the courteous, thrgallant,
the profeffing, the plausible Frenchman, our
good friend, our ally, enters the cabin sword
in hand ; breaks the chest and the loeker,
whips the sailor, aflaffinates the captain, and
.conveys the cargo to Viftor Hugues, with
an air perfectly polite and Parilian. Ameri
cans, be not deceived. Your ancestors, in
1755Â» knew the nature of those
those who growl and chatter in
France. They were eileemed rightly thrn;
and in all the wonderful revolutions of ths
republick the national character is uniform.
Against. a mad againft
five gimcrack kings, against the miMiftrous
unatural domination of the populace, against
a cut-throat army, against apostate priests
let 113 build a Chinese wall, and know France
only as a corner in the map of Europe
Miserable is an intimacy'with a people, who
live " without God in the world,", who tip
the wink in murder, who eradicate the fa
cial charities, who give lax reins to ter
ror, and who labour to disturb the brightest
hopes, the fondcfl wiihes of the hump
heart. 1, <Â» i"i m
