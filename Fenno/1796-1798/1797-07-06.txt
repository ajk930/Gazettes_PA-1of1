They further desire that aU such claims may not

specially set forth ehe nature of the evidence by
which the claimants rifpe&ively undertake to iab
ftantiate the fame.
Extraift from the said article,
Whereas it is alledged by divers British nier
" chants, and others his majeftyV fubjeSs, that
" debts to a confidcrable amount, wlfich were bona
" fide contrailed, before the peace, still remain
" owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the
United States; and that by the operation of va
" rious lawful impediments, fmce the peace, not
1 " only the full recovery of the said debts has been
u delayed, but also the value and security thereof.
" have been in several instances impaired and less
" ened, so that by the ordinary ceurfe of judicial
; i tl proceedings, the British creditors cannot now
" obtain and aftuajly have anu receive full and
" adequate compensation for the losses and dama
" ges which tney have thereby fuf ained: It is a
greod that in all such cases where full compenfa
" tioÂ» for such losses and damages cannot for wbÂ»t-
ever reason be aduÂ«lly obtained, had and recei
" ve d by the Taiol creditors in (he ordinary courfa
" of justice, the United States will make full and
complete compensation for the fame to the (aid
41 creditors : but it is diftinfUy undrrftood, that
" this provision is to extend to such loiles only as
" have been occasioned by the lawful impediments
" aforelaid, and is not to extend to losses occasion
" ed by such insolvency of the debtors or other
" causes, as would equally have operated to pro
" duce such loss, if the said impediments had not

upon my judicial character, signed with the
name of Mr, Cabell, a member of Con
gress, I think it proper to take some notice
of it, on account of a riiidake in point of
faft which he seems to have committed.â
From the tenor of his obfervat;ions, any
one would conclude lhat I wrote the charge
he condemns vvh a view to draw forth a
censure upon him or some other members of
Congrels who had written circular letters
to their ddndituents. The truth is, I never
knew that Mr. Cabell had writteri any
circular letter at all, until I heard the pre
sentment read in Court, nor have I seen the
letter alluded tQ to this hour. I had in
deed seen printed letters of one or two other
members of Congress from the fame State,
but had them not in my thoughts when I
prepared that charge, which I wrote delibe
rately in Philadelphia, in order to be deli
vered in Maryland and Virginia. The fame
fcharge was delivered fubdantially in both
States, and without a view to any particu
lar person. With regard to the sentiments
of that charge, I am ready on all proper oc
casions to vindicate every word of it, as well
as the propriety of delivering such a charge
on fiich ari occasion. In the mean time, I
have a right to expect, that if the charge be
censured, it shall be censured for what it re
ally contains, and hot for what exiits merely
in the imagination of the cenfurei". I have
Do hesitation in faying, that if it has the
tendency Mr. CabelL ascribes to it, it does,
ia my opinion, deserve a severer censure than
any he has bellowed upon it.
The conduct of the Court after the pre
ferment has incurred Mr. Cabell's cen
sure. It is difficult to fay what can escape
it, if theconduftof the Court on that occa
sion cannot. They knew not such a pre
ferment was in contemplation. It was
brought into CoUrt the fame day that the
charge was delivered, and without any ad
journment having taken place, and agreeable
to the usual practice, I presume, in Virgi
nia, (though different from that in forae
otbei* States) was read by the Clerk-with
out even being seen by the Court. None of
the circular letters which were the objeft of
the presentment was produced to the Court,
nor in poffeflion of the Judges. The Jury
were aiked if they had any business to re
quire t?.eir attention longer, or if they wish
ed to flay to coftfider of any. They an
swered in the negative. The Attorney for
the United States was asked if he wished
them to be detained longer. He declared
he knew of no occasion for it. They were
then discharged. Were the Court to cate
chise the Jury for their censure of a publi
cation which they themselves had'never seen?
Or to direst a prosecution upon a publica
tion without knowing the contents of it ?
Ought they in any indance indeed to direst
a prosecution in the presence of the Attor
ney, within whose particular department it
lies, and when no occasion calls for their
immediate interposition ? Were they to in
terfere unnecessarily, they might justly be
charged with becoming parties to a prose
cution and incapacitating themselves from
the impartial conduft of Judges afterwards.
Whatever might be the intention of the
Jury, which was composed of very respec
table men, it has been a frequent praftice in
some of the southern States for Grand Ju
ries to present what they considered as grie
vances though they could not be the foun
dation of a Criminal prosecution in the
Court. I have known such presentments
containing very heavy charges against the
Government itfelf. It never occurred to
me to be proper to suppress a praftice which
I found established, whether the exercise of
it was agrjeable to my private sentiments. or
not; and I incline to think, had the Grand
Jury at Richmond, inilead of presenting
those circular letters, presented any obnoxi
ous aft of the Government, and the Court
by an exertion of power had arbitrarily sup
pressed the presentment, it would have been
the fubjeft of a very virulentâand poflibly
a very juftâinveftive,by some of those per
sons who have no scruple in condemning the
Court for not interfering with this.
With regard to the illiberal epithets Mr.
Cabell hasbeftowed, not only on me, but
on the other Judges of the Supreme Court,
I leave him in full poffeflion of all thf cre
dit he can derive from the use of them. I
defy him or any man to shew, that in the
exercise of my judicial charafter, I have
been ever influenced in the flighted degree
be any man, either in or out of office, and
I assure him I shall be as little influenced by
this mode of attack by a member of Con
gress as I can be by any other.

Extraft of a letter from D<jftor Samuel H.
P. Lee, Member of the Connefticiit
Medical Society to Elijah Perkins, M. D.
of Philadelphia, dated New London,
June 16th, ,1797.
In the course of my praftice with Doftor
Perkins's Patent Mefellic Instruments, a
very extraordinary cafe of Aerpes Exedens,
or what is commonly called, salt Rheum, or
Tetter, came under my notice, and as the
points wholly perfefted the cure, I will give
you a short hidory of the complaint, as it had
appeared during near 14 years. Mr.E.F. Inn
keeper,in my neighbourhood, applied to me
for relief some time lad February, I found
him fitting in an easy chair, cloathed in a
loose gOwn, and apparently exhausted for
want of deep' and reft. He informed me
that he h?.d not been able to lay in bed, or
wear any other cloaths than i'aofe liar,en for
neat three months,. that his disorder raged
most during the winter months, that his
drength failed Turn, his appetite bad, and
that he had nearly despaired ever recovering
From this recurrence of his complaint. On
examining the fitrface of his body, it was
one continued ulcer ; the breaking out of
the Rheum was followed by a copious dis
charge of bloody sanies, Which colleftihg
ind adhering to the furface of his body be
came of a fc Â»jby like appearance, and by
their irritation produced a colieftion of pu
rulent matter. The superior extremities,
the head, neck and bread were incurdated
entirely with scabs, and inflamed fores, some
of the Glands greatly swelled and very pain
ful ; the legs and feet swelled and ulcerated.
Fife informed me that this was the condition
he had been in for several years, but never
i before so bad as now, that it disappeared in
hot Weather so that he was- tolerably com
fortable ; and that he had been attended by
many physicians to no effeft. Seeing no
great profpeft of relieving him by medicines
; I was determined to try the Points, think
ing they might at lead relieve the pains and
1 inflammatory affection of the (kin, and ac
-1 cordingly used them myfelf, or had them
; ufedtwo or three hoursinceffantly, by which
' time he found himfelf so much relieved, he
! wished to continue the prafticeâa lad was
ordered to use them three or four times a
day ; he grew better, the inflammation sub
sided, and the wounds all began to digest
and heal, the scabs fell off, and left,the fkm
entire, though very delicate and tender. In
4 or 5 days he walked and in four weeks
was perfeftly well and drong, had an in
creasing appetite, and undertook business,
' which he had neglefted for many years. It
; is proper to observe thatin the course of this
I praftice he took every three or four days a
i solution of Salts and Manna to remove cof
tivenefs, but no other kind of medicines
whatever as I wasdetermined to seethe effeft
of the points in so extraordinary and obdi
nate a difrafe. I have used the points in
many 9ther obdinate cases, and have found
them to conquer the complaint'by a close
perseverance in the operation, and am con
vinced that the failures, which have accom
panied this ufeful praftice, and which have
naturally shaken the confidence of many who
have given them but a partial trial, have
proceeded from their negleft in this particu
larâthe man is now very healthy, and no
i appearance of complaint about him. I have
in many indances used the points in ulcerous
fore legs, and cedlematous swelling, with
good success ; they evidently remove the in
flammatory disposition and leave the dedroy
ed parts capable of healing without the
trouble of tedious dreflingsâl have had one
cafe of deafnefs in a gentleman about 75
years of age, very much relieved by the use
of the points.

SPJZECH of DAVID WOOD,
While 1 flanding in the pillory at Charkflown,
â¢ Newhampjhire, May Z'Jth, 1797, forforg
ing a deed.
SYMPATHIZING FRIENDS,
You come here this day to fee a fad fight:
a poor old man publicly disgraced for. at
tempting to make a penny out of fifty acres
of Vermont rocks ; and yet I fee some here
in gay coats, mounted on naggifh hqrfes,
who have made thousands out of lands, to
which you had no more title, than I to Da
vid Dray's rocks. But you are great rogues
and wear silver spurs, and white beaver hats,
and flourilh your loaded whips, forget what
you once were, drink your Madeira, and
talk of your millions of acres, and set at
your ease ; while poor I, who have specu
lated a little, in a fifty acre lot, which would
not maintain a woodchuck, must stand here ;
for I am a little rogue, and have no preten
sions to be a great {peculator.
Let me ask you, what is the difference,
as to fin, between a man, who forges a deed
and fells lands under it, and a man, who
fells lands, to which he knows he has no ti
tle ? You all know the great 'Squire
he bought lands in Bolton at the time all
their great men were caught in the Georgia
land trap. The 'Squire came home by the
way of, Hartford, at the very moment when
the Hartford foxes were wailing for the loss
of their tails, in the fame spring trap. The
'Squire found he had bought the Devil, and
was determined to fell him again on the belt
terms he tould. He put spurs to his old
mare, rode before the news, and fold to the
widow Lowly and her two sons, who had
just come of age, about fifty thoufarid acres
of land, which lay the Lord knows where,
and to which'he knew he had no title, and
took all their father the old deacon's farm
in mortgage, and threatens to turn the poor
widow upon the town, and tier two boys
Upon the world ; but this is the way of the
world. The 'Squire is a great speculator,
he is of the quorum, can fit on the feilions,
and fine poor girls for natural mis-steps! ; but
I am a little rogue, wito speculated in only
fifty acres of rocks, and must stand here in
the pillory.
Then caere is the state of Georgia. They
fold millions of acres to which they had no.
tnore title, than I to David Dray's land.
Their great men pocketed the money ; and
their honorable assembly publicly burnt all
the records of their conveyance, and are now
felling the lands again. Â£ *"â¢ Georgia is a
great honorable state. They can keep ne
gro (laves, race horses, gouge out eyes, fend
members to fight duels at Congress, and cry
out, for France and the guillotine, and be
honored in the land ; while poor I, who
never murdered any one, who never fought
a duel or gouged an eye ; and had too much
honor to burn my forged deed, when I had once
been wicked enough to make it, must stand here
in the pillory, for I am a little rogue,â
Take warning by my fad fate ; and if you
must speculate in lands let it be in millions
of acres ; and if you must be rogues, take
warning by my unhappy fate and become
great rogues.âFor as it is said in a pair of
verses I read when I was a boy,
Little villains must fubmic to fate,
That great one. may enjoy the world in state.
And again,
A little knav'ry is a dangerous thing, .
Great cheats will flourifh, while the small ones
swing.

HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES,
Saturday, July.
(Concluded from yejicrday s Gazette )
Mr. Otis observed that the gentleman from
Pennsylvania had furnifhed a conclusive argu
ment in favour of the proposed tax ; fur if a cer
tificate of naturalization was not required by
law, the duty would be optional and confequent
fair and equitable. âHe agreed that the present
amendment waÂ« merely a question of revenue,
but the policy of a tax was always afair obje<st
of discussion, ami it was therefore proper to
eonfider the indireit and remote Â«ffe<Â£U of the
present bill upon the naturalization of foreign
ers. He denied the expediency of affording too
gieat a facility to their adrrtiffion among us
In the infancy of the country it was neceftary
to encourage emip-'ation, and fore'gners of ail
countries had been wifely invited and allured to
fettle in our territory;âTo the industry of emi
grants many parts of the country were indebted
for the molt valuable improvements in agricul
ture and the arts âand he knew foreigners who
were an hirtior to the United States, who had
aided in forming their constitutions, in fighting
for their libertifs, and who were not less meri
torious citizens for not being born in the country.
There were others in that house and other legif
laturts, who were entitled to the highest confi
deratien and refpefl.âHe rejoiced in the ad
vantages derived from persons of this defcrip
tion ; they wÂ«uld not be affe&ed by the present
tax; but he was not anxious to give a greater
latitude to the laws of naturalization ; on the
contrary he thought it wife to rtflrain that privi
lege.âHe did not belier,e it to be longer neces
sary to rely Upon thatfource of population ; but
coniidered the native American germ tobe am
ply fuffiuient for the production offuchfcions
aÂ» were worth cultivation.â âHe denied that
the manners of Europe were the ma' ners of this
country. 111 that quarter of the world a revo
lution of manners of the mod formidable nature
j threatened the subversion of all moral principle,
| of all fecial order, and a fyllem ot profligacy
had swept off every vestige of what ever was
I molt amiable and refpeilable in the eye of hu
manityâHe trusted the cafe was different in this
country âIt was true that Pennsylvania was in
debted in a great measure for her prosperity to
the irduftrious eftablifhrtienu formed by for
eigners of various descriptions, but it should al
so be remembered that the fouleft stain in the
annals of that state was not to be impifted to
natural born Cit ecus.
This amendment he said weul4 not affeiSt
those men who had already acquired lands in
this country, nor the deserving part of those
who might seek an asylum in it. Persons of
that description would easily pay the tax âBut
it would tend to foreciol'e the inafs of vicious and
disorganizing characters, who could not live
peaceably at home; and who after unfurling
the standard of rebellion in their own countries
might come hither to revolutionize ours.
He felt every difpolitjon to refpeit those hon
est and industrious people whether Germans,
Irishmen or foreigners of whatever country
who had become citizens; and to fraterij'ze with
them while they remained obedient to the laws,
and faithful to their adopted country j but he
did not wish to invi'e hordes of wild IrifhmeÃ,
nor the turbulent and disorderly of all parts of
the world, to come here with a view to diflurb
our tranqudity, after having fucqeeded in the
overthrew of their own governments. 1.
Mr. Potter was willing to agree to
make the sum ten dollars, in order to shorten
the business, though he did not think 50
too much.
Mr. Coit thought it unfortunate that
they should, in this instance, have wandered
from the object of the bill. He trusted
when the friends' of the bill, who were also
friends of this measure, saw the difficulty
which would attend the incorporating of
t he fubjeft with it, they would give it np.
Mr. Baldwin was in favor of the smaller
sum. He said this was a fubjeft upon which
it was always found difficult to legislate, as
different parts of the country had very dif
ferent ideas upon it. In the part of the
country from whence he came the people
would not approve of such a tai, he belie
ved there were parts of the country which
would not bbjedl to a tax of 1000 dollars
upon the objedt ; but it was not so in other
parts. All the prosperity in some states
depended upon emigration and to lay a hea
vy tax of this kind would be to do violence
to their feelings. When, he heard differ
ent gentlemen express their opinions he
knew they were the opinions of the people,
from whence they came : if they were as
well acquainted with the whole of the coun
try, as with 50 miles round their own
homes, their sentiments would be different.
Mr. Sttgreaves thought this tax as
jultifiable and as much connected with the
present Ibill as the taz upon lawyers, and
that 20 dollars would be a reasonable sum.
Ttie question for inferring ten dollars was
put and negatived and then 5 was moved
and carried, there being 56 in favor of it.
The question whs then upon agreeing to
the proportion as amended-
Mr. Swan wick spoke at length on this
fubjeft, and dwelt particularly on the hard
ftiip which the poorer part of emigrants
would experience iu paying this tax and if
th?y did r.ot'pay it, they would be living in
the country jis foreigners,and notas citizens
of a free country.
Mr. Venable did not cbfifrder this as a I
tax which would laU equally on all foreign- '
ers who became citizens, but partially upon
those who might have occasion for certifi
cates, and even duplicates.of them.
The question on this proportion was ta
ken by yeas and nays follow .

Estr;ift of a letter from General S , da

Member of Congress.
Captain Sanger 12 days from Port-au-

thos-U has ordered all captures and con
demnation of American property to cease,
in eonfequence as was reported of orders
from France.âHe adds that two or three
American vessels lately taken were liberated
in conformity. Captain Sanger is a very
rtfpeclable man, and fays I may rely on the
truth of his account.
The folloivh'g papers were communicated to

I have Cnce requeued information on the fuÃjcifl
from thfc Governor General of Canada and his

ty to allure you, that ne expedition of the nature
of that alluded to has been or is intended by the

DETARTMENT.of STATE,
Philadelphia, July 1, 1797.
SIR,
\ our note of the 19th of"the last month, 1
alluding to the suspicions exprefled by the
( Spanilh minister, respecting an expedition
fuggglled to be preparing at the Lakes, a
gainst the Spanilh posts in Louisiana, I laid
before the President of the United States,
who received great fatisfa&ion from your
a durance that no such expedition has been
or is intended by the British government.
AVill you permit me to inquire whether
you can give any information concerning
sny other project of an expedition against
any part of the dominions of Spain adjacent
to the territory of the United States, where
or from whence any co-operation was con
templated ? lam aware of the delicacy of
this inquiry : but the franknefs of your ver
bal answer formerly relating 'to the alledgcd
expedition from Canada, and the assurances
in your note abovementioned, lead me to
hope that you will not deem the present in
improper, and the proofs you have
uniformly given of refpeft to the rights and
, interests of the United, States authorise the
further hope that you will feel yourfelf at
liberty to communicate any information you
pofiefs which on this occasion may concern
theirtrar.quility and welfare ; and I beg you
to be aflured that it is on this ground only
that I would make the inquiry. I will add,
however, that it is not the result offufpicion,
but of information, (in which your name is
introduced) that some projedt of the kind
has been contemplated, and that the' means
proposed for carrying it into execution
could not but be highly detfimental'to the
United States.
I have the honor to be, with great refpeft,
Sir,
Your mod obedient servant,
TIMOTHY PICKERING.
Robert Liston, Esq. â¢
envoy extraordinary &
minister plenipotentiary
of his Britannic majesty
to the United States.
R Liston presents his refpe&s to Colo
nel Pickering, Secretary of State.
I have had the honor of receiving your
letter of yellerday.
In the course qf lad winter some persons
did a&ually propose to me a plan for an at
tack on the Floridas and the other poffefii
ons of his Catholic Majesty adjoining to the
territories of the United States.
The general outline of the projeft was,
th"- the expedition (houldbe undertaken by
a British force sent by sea, and seconded by
a number of men resident within the limits
of the United States, who I was allured,
would be- willing to join the King's llandard,
if it were eredted on the Spanish territory.
I informed the proje&ors that I could not
give any encouragement to a plan of this na
ture ; and I particularly stated two objefti
011s to itâthe impropriety of any measure
that tended to a violation of the neutrality 1
of the United States, and the inhumanity of
calling in the aid of the Indians, a circum
stance hinted at in thetonverfation that had
taken place 011 the fubjeft.
I conceived it to be my duty however to
mentiofi the business in my correfpondencc
with my superiors : and I lately received
an answer, acquainting me that his Majefr
ty's ministers did not thinkproperto give a
ny countenance to the projett. The two
objections above alluded to (which I had of
course infilled on in my report) are stated as
fuflkient reasons for its rejection.
You must fillow me, Sir, to decline en
tering into any further particulars. On the
one hand because, although I have all'along
lufpected that the persons, who proposed the
plan to me, might not improbably be em
ployed by the enemies of Great Britain, to
endeavor with sinister views to insinuate
themfeives into my confidence, yet as these
may be falfe, I should not be
juttified in betraying the secrets of men who â¢
ir.ay have meant me well: and on the other
tend, because however loose the principles
of tlie/e speculators may have been on the
fubjedt of the law s os nations (as it regards
the duties of neutrality) none of them in
their intcrcourfe with me ever expressed sen
timents that were in ar y degree hoftileto the
interests of the United States.
Philadelphia, 2d July.
Colonel King's Iron-zvoris,
April 21/, 1797.
DEAR CAREY,
I widled to have seen you, before I return
ed to Philadelphia; but lam obliged to re
turn to the .felTion of the Congress, which
commences on the 1 Jth May.
Among other things thai I wished to
have seen you about, was the business Cap
i tain Chediolm mentioned to the British
Minister last winter at Philadelphia.
I believe, but am not quite sure, that
' the plan then talked of will be attempted
this fall; and if it is attempted, it will be in
a much larger way than then talked of; and
1 if the Indians adl their part, I have no doubt
but it will succeed. A man ofconfeqiienee
has gone to England about the business,
and if*he makes arrangements as he expe&s,
I shall myfelf have a hand in the business,
and probably shall be at the'head of the bu
siness on the part of the British. You are,
however, to understand that it is not yet
quite certain that the plan will be attempt
ed; yet you will do well to keep things in
a proper train of J aÂ£tion in cafe it should be
attempted, and to do so will require all your
management. I fay require all your ma
nagement, because you must take care, in
whatever you fay to Rogers, or any body
else, not to let the plan be difcov.red by
Hawkins, Dinfmore, and Byers, or any o
ther person in the interest of' the United
State 3 or Spain.
If I attempt this plan, I shall expert to
have you, and all my Indian country and
Indian friends with me; but you are now in
good business, I hope, and you are not to
rifle the loss of it by faying any thing that
will hurt you until you again hear from me.
Where Captain Chefholm is I do not know;
I left him in Philadelphia in March, and he
frequently visited the Minister, and spoke
upon the fubjert; but I believe he will go
into the Creek nation, by way of South
Carolina or Georgia. He gave out he was
going to England, but I did not believe
him. Among the things that you mayfafely
do, will be to keep up my eonfequence with
Watts, and the Creeks and Cherokees gen
erally, and yon must by no means fay any
thing in favour of Hawkins> but as often as
you can with fafety to yourfelf, you may
teach the Creeks to believe he is no better
than he should be. Any power or eonfe
quence he gets will be against our plan.
Perhaps Rogers, who has no office to
lose, is the belt man to give out talks against
Hawkins. Read the letter to Rogers, and
if you think it best to fend it to him, put a
wafer in it, and forward it to him by a fafe
hand, or perhaps you had best fend for him
to comt; to you, and speak to him yourfelf,
refpefting the state and profpert of things.
I have advised you in whatever ypu do
to take care of yourfelf. I have now to
tell you to take care of (Tie too, for a dis
covery of the plan would prevent the success,
and much injure all parties concerned. It
may be that the Commissioners may not run
the line as the Indians expeft, or w'ifh, and
in that rafit it is probable the Indians may
be taught to blame me for making the
Treaty.
To' such complaints against me, if such
there are, it may be said by ray friends, at
proper times and places, the Doublehead
confirmed the Treaty with the President, at
Philadelphia, and receives as much as 5000
dollars a year ta be paid to the nation over
and above the firft price: Indeed it may with
truth be said, that though 1 made the treaty,
that 1 made it by the inflru&ions of the Pre
sident, and in fart it may with truth be said,
1 hat I was by the President inrtruftad to pur
chase much more land than the Indians would
agree to fell. 'Ehis fort of talk will be throwing
all the blame off me, upon the late Piefiderit,
Â»nd as he is now out of ofiv.e, it will be ps
110 eonfequence how much the Indiavs blarre
him. And among ot her things that may be
said for ire, is, that I was ndt at the running
of the line, and that if 1 had been, it would
have been run more to their fatibfaAion. Jn
fliort, you understand the fubjert, and mitil
take care to pive.out the proper talks to keep
up my tenftquence with ihe Creeks aid
Cherokees. Can't Rogers contrive to get t' *
'Creeks ta desire the President to take Haw
kins out of the nation, for if he stays in the
Creek nation, and gets the good-will of '.he
nation, he can and will do great injury to
our plans. When you have read thi3 letter
over three times, then bum it. I lh*ll b<
it Knuxville in July or August, when 1 will
fend for Watts, and give him the yhifkey I
promised him, Sec.

The conduct of those Editors who have

who had made treasonable proposals to him,
cannot be reprobated in language too se
vere. We publish this day an authentic
copy of every thing that has yet passed on
the fiibjeft. We shall offer r.o comments.
Our readers canhot fail to observe a most
striking aud honorable contrail when com

MR. FENNO,
There is a barefaced assertion in Bache's
paper of this day, purporting that the fait
tax was carried by the absence of certain
exclusive patriots. The truth is, when all 1
those patriots were present, a proposition to 1
impose thirteen cents per bushel was loft only
by two votes at the beginning of the feflion 1
âand at this time Meflrs. Sinnickfon,
Sewall and Bayard were absent. Again the I
> fame Bache imputes the parage oÂ£ thi uamp
â¢ act to the absence of members, and
> among otliersof Mr. Swanwick. The fadt
1 is, that S\vai:\Â»k\k was in favor of the bill,
at lead he has always said so. There "were
â¢- also abf:nt the following gentlemen, who
were in favor of the Kill ; viz. Me firs. Brad
huiy, Bullock, Chapman, Ege, Grove,
Imlay, and Kittera.

Town Lots.
A TOWN named BEULA, one milts fqtiare,
bsing laid out on the Blacklick Creek, Som
i erfct County, Pcnnfylvania, Lots therein of 58 feet,
hy 125 feet are now felling at ten dollars each ;
their situation in the town to he detetmiiled by %
j ballot before the firft of Acgult, and deeds for the
fame will.be deliver*? by the fubicriber before the
firft of OtÂ£lobÂ§r next.
j - MORGAN J. RHEES,
77 > SciulhSccond-Areet, Philadelphia.
Tie purchasers of lots in Beula have the following
profpeisU.of appreciating their property :
1. If is remote from any other town, and sur
rounded by great bodies of excellent land, capabk
: of producing every kind of grain and vegetables,
| and is without dcubtone Â®f the best grazing coun
! tries in the United States.
2. In point of health the Croatian is not exceed
ed by any 011 the continent
j J Besides numerouÂ» springs and runs, of the fin-
I eft quality, there'is a creek for water works (on
\ which mills are now buUding) running through the
town, V
1 4 The publ : cToad frem Philadelphia to Pjttf-
go through it, which beinp more level
ami nearer than any other rout 'must become uni-
Virftlly travelled : aided by the navigation of Ju
niara and .Cor.cmaugh, goods may be c nveyed at
lead 2 tr 3 dollars -per twt. cheaper from the for
mer to the latter place, than by the old road thro'
Bedford.
5- Being in the centre of a fleurilhing settle
ment, arid taking in the Ihorteft portage between
the .eastern and western waters, it is likely to bc
c6mc a deposit for stores, 'a manufacturing town,
and a feat.of justice. Besides the old settlers, up
wards of ons hundred emigrants have fettled in the
vicinity of Beula, since last October, and many
more havs engaged to join them this summer.
6. A Land-Offide for supplying aftual settlers
with farms to a considerable amount, ahd in vari
ous situations, will be immediately opened in the
tqwn. The proprietors of land in the circumja
cent country art felicited to fend their drafts and
terms of fate, or leafing, to Thomas Jones, Sur
veyor, iu Beula, who will give security for any
trull reposed in him : with such co-operating aid,
the progrefsof the settlement will be the more ra
f idly advanced and extended t.o distant townftips.
7- A public liUary for the benefit of the settlers,
will be eftablilhea in the town, towards laying the
foundation of which, upwards of one theufand
volumes are already purchased and principally sent
forward.
8. Two hundred acres ef land adjoining the
town, besides lots atid fubferiptions,will be applied
to support a minister and preceptor, capable of
teaching the ufeful and liberal arts.
9. After defraying ncccfiary eipences, the mo
ney arising from the present sales will belaid out in
public buildingsâA place of worlhip, school
house and library room, are the firft obje&s.
IS. Every,profeflional man and mechanic, on
cond tion of building a with a stone or biick
chithney, and residing in it, before the firft of No
vember next, will be entitled to soar lots gratis,
free fortver from ground rent. Five and ten acre
out lots in-.y likewifp be obtained 011 rcafonable
terms.
*. * The two central streets in Beula are 100
feet wide, and the others 80 feet. Refeiwed fquarts
