The revolntionifts in the Ligurian (Ge

to make republicans, than the use of guil
lotines. They have appointed forty missi
onaries to travel over their territory, to
preach and explain the principles of demo
cracy.
The Earl of St. Vincents has appointed
William Hale Gage, Esq. to the command
of the Terpfiehore in the place of Capt.
Bowen, killed at Teneriffe.
A Dublin paper states that 2446 looms
are now idle in the cotton, {ilk, fluff, broad
cloth and ribbon manufactures ; leaving
11,458 industrious hands unemployed, and

The purchafersofnationalconfifcated pro- <
perty in France fuffer so much from the old ;
proprietors ortheir frirnds, that in th* sou- 1
thern departments, Mont Blanc and Ifere
and Var, 60,000 of them had entered into <
associations for their mutual protedion. I
In a debate in the Council of Five Hun
dred August 28, a motion was made for the 1
payment of officers on half pay ; but it was '
proposed that no officer should receive his 1
money in the Commune where the legifla- i
tive body fat. General Jourdan remon- (
ftrated against this article as unjust. A- I
mong other reasons suggested by him for '
not compelling old officers to retire into the
departments, we. notice the followingâ 1
" that to wear regimentals in the depart- t
mcnts was fufficient to endanger their fafe- c
ty." This declaration excited murmurs, t
and was, by one officer, denied. Butothers \
supported the opinion as corrcft. I
We note this opinion of a cool discrete {
man, who cannot be fufpe&ed of inifrepre
fentation as a stronger proof of the popular r
sentiment in France with regard to the exist
ing Government, than a hundred harangues r
of Jacobins in office. If the regimentals of I
Vep'iblican officers are so disagreeable a fight
in the departments, the inference is certain, i;
that the cause and the form of government n
in which they have been worn, are odious t:
and unpopular. ti
Fasts of all kinds a re ir.ceffantly occur
ring to convince the world that a maj'ority
of the people in France vvifh for a monar
chyânot the old regimen of defpotifrn, ; ti
feudal services and church monopolies ; but ti
a monarchy governed by a fixed constitution tl
and laws enaÂ£tecj by a National Reprefenta- j ei
ticn. The most enlightened men in that tc
country seem to think the manners and ha- fii
bits of the people, the-populoufnexs of the
country, and the vices of its inhabitants re
quire such a form of government.
The armies however are of a different o
pmion. They â Tubfiil on their enemiesâ
, they have not felt the evils and insecurity of
rights, the anarchy, distress and inveterate
pamons which torment the citizens at hotqe
-- i hey are firm and unanimous in support
of a republican form of government, and
ot while these armies exist, with such fcoti

Extrad oj a letter from cap/. Howard, of the
<. flip Montezuma f-Lound from Liverpool to
James river, dated Sf. Thomas's, Oil.
1 5 . 1797.'
" Ori the 2d of September lift I was
captured by a French brig, called L'
Aigle, capt. Marin from St. D'Uningo, who
y took out the people with both mattes-, and
c . ordered the ship for Porto Rico.; and-af
f - ter experiencing every misfortune from the
g unfkilfulnefs of the French and their want
t { of humanity, we arrived off the island of
5 * Porto Rico the last day of September.
H Just as we were entering the harbour of Por
it. to Rico, we were re-captured by the Bri
>f t ' l^l frigate L'Atniable, commanded by
1- William Granville Lobb, who took ua in

LONDON, Sept. 29.
A council was field on Wednesday of all
the cabinet mim'fters, except the Earl of
Liverpool, when we understand, it was fi
nally determined that parliament (hould meet
for th e dispatch of business on Tuesday,
the 2d of November next.
The Irilfi parliament is prorpguecj by a
proelamation dated the 15th inft- from *he
[ 2ill inft. to the 24th of oÂ£t.
, The latr negociat'ionâThe following are
. given as the outlines of the last conferences
between Lord Malmelbury and M. Treil
hard.
M. Treilhard, on arriving at Lisle, im
mediately waited on Lord Mahncfbury, and
after the ufuaf salutation, aildrefied his
Lord (hip as follows :â" My Lord, the
Frenph government has charged- me to ac
quaint your excellency, that the events
whith have lately passed in France have not
altered theJineere difpojition of the executive
government for peace ; and it has therefore
determined to conclude it on the basis de
livered by M. Letourneur at the commence
ment of the negociatioo. The French go
vernment has no objeÂ£t more at heart than
to restore harmony between France and
England, according to the principles which
may secure the prosperity of the two na
tions. At the fame time Mr. Treilhard
presented a paper to Lord Malmelbury,
containing the ultimatum of the French go
vernment.
Lord Malmelbury, after having read the
paper with attention, replied to M. Treil
hardâ" Among the objects contained in
the paper put into my hands, there are some
of the utmeft importance, and on which it
is necessary I (hould consult wi(h my col
leagues ; but 1 thf'fik 1 may fay, there are
some points which are inadnriflible. How
ever, there requires time to refleft on a bu
finefÃ of so very important a nature, before
I can give you a categorical answer."
1 reilhard then alked his lordlhip whether
he had full powers to treat bafis that
was proposed ; to which Lord Malmelbury
repliedâthat he had full powers to treat
for any terms ; but that his inftru&ions
did not permit him to accept of the propo
litioHS offered, without firft communicating
with his court.
" My Lord,'faid Treilhard, the govern
ment which sent me hither has charged me
to fignify to you, that if your inftru&ions
do not allow you to accept of the condi
tions I have delivered you Ihould quit Lille
within twenty four hours." Lord Malmef
bury replied, " ttll your government that I
shall be out of Lisle within eight hours."
The parties then bowed to each other and
retired.
It was yesterday reported, that very se
rious mntiriy had broken out among the
Dotch fleet. <t-.
A Vienna letter of the 9th faf 3, the Ital
ian army of of 132,000 1
; men, is to be reirifoi-ced by recruits and 1
troops of the line, which every day pass thrtS'
that city.

The hofti'e dispositions evinced by the
triumvirs, being without semblance of con
troul on the deftruftion of Carnot and Bar-,
thelemyledtoan apprehenfionthattheconfer- 1
ences at Lisle, which appeared a facrifice r
to public opinion, would terminate on the 1
firft phulible pietextâbut a pretext was c
e not waited for, and the request of our aui
t- baffador to be allowed to consult on a moil .
extraordinary requisition, occasioned an or
-- der that he (hould leave the country. The
- executive conceiving that the people, wea
>f ried of carnage, would require to be told the
e cause of itscootinuiÃce, have di/playedmuch
e iubtilitv in a proclamation, which required
t the armies to prepare to adl offenfively a
d gainst the Emperoi, on the 6th of O&ober,
- but the great objeÂ£t of which was, to irri
t> tate the public mind against England and
Audria ; whom they rcprefent as the caus
es of all the calamities that had happened,
and that were ;ibout to follow ; though the
'â¢ refufal to return Mantua tfv the Emperor,
as flipulated in the preliminary articles, and
3 the invitation to the countries of Treves,
1, Cologn, &c. See. .to solicit the proteftiou of

Â® president of the municipality of Cologn,
â¢ who intimates in his proclamation, that
France requires the Cisalpine republic to
Â® form immediate guard of 6b,0t0 menâ
prove that the Executive of Fianct;, either \
' from an unfatiable thirst of conquell, or an 1
to divert the people from the coofideration
ofdomellic opprefiion, have not had any fe- ?
rious desire for the reiteration of peace. j
The death of Gens. Hoche is, to the di- j
reftory, a misfortune of the firft magnitude I
*âThe fame desperate spirit had led each to |
power, 'and similar interest created rccipro- >
r cal regard. '
1 Moreau, almost immortal/zed by his re- j
treat, isdeftroyedbyhis perfidy : hisftrength 1
would have been perhaps iuvincible if, to
1 retain it, he had not traduced and
' his friend. *
' To ii finite resolution Jourdan, and many
others, join cenfiderable military talents,
â¢ but, befidesa deficiency of thatgenius which
should comprise all things at once, they are
not to be trailed.
Buonaparte, who unites all the qualities
rCquifite.to found an empire, continues his
profeffit>ns of attachment to the dire&ory.
âWhilll each parfues the fame objeft, the
appearance will'continue ; but the firll clalh
of interest will create hostility, and we err
if the period is far distant.
Yesterday the French emigrant, General
' Frotte, arrived in town from France ; he
came by way of Havre and Portsmouth.and
left Paris on the 26th ult. He represents
that capital to be in a state of great and ge
neral confufion, and taentionsthe prevalence
of a report that hostilities had been renewed
between the' French and Auftrians.
The fifty-four new members in the coun
cils are the immediate creatures of the di
â  redlory.
In the southern and western provinces of
France, the people have manifefted their dif
. approbation of the recent revolution in the
capital, by adls of violence against the par
tisans of the party j they afford
afylÂ«raÃ to the emigrants, and have depriv
ed of thtir offices some funftionaries who
attempted to enforce thelate decrees against
them. The ci-devantprovincesof Auvergne,
Lionnois, Main, Anjou, and Bretagne, are
mentioned among the most di(affeÂ£tedâ;tbe j '
latter in particular, where the military p<jw- | '
er is infufficient to repress the disorders of J
the populace. Peace is every where desired, 1 |
and the government was censured for defer- '
ring the period of its return.
The unfortunate prosecuted Frenchmen ; '
who daily flock to this kingdom, represent j
the mass of their countrymen as on the eve â 
of infurreÂ£lion, for the purpose of enforc- ; '
ing of thelate sanguinary laws
against emigrants, and a serious dis
position qn the part of the direflory
to peace. Their statements are too fre
quently the impreflion yf their hopes, and '
have often proved erroneousâthey are now !
unanimous and consistent in Hating (and '
all that we have heard on the fubjedl war- j
ranny our believing them) that the new ty- j
rants of France is obaoxioua to the people, â 
who seek occasion to destroy it. \

men (Miss Murphy and M'f s Power) iti j
company with several other "females, bath- f
ing in the river at the above place, had ven- c
tured rather too far, when the tide being a
cm the turn going out, they were carried a
beyond their depth : the cries of the other
femalfs alarmed a small boy who was near j
the plsce. He haftcrted to the spot, and t
feeing their melancholy situation, inamedi- c
ately plunged to their afliftance ; but, we 1
al-e sorry to date, his humane endeavours \
'proved fruitlefs, as Miss Mutphy funk be- f
fore he could reach her : he, however, was 1
enabled to convey Miss Power to the fi'.ore,

out any visible signs of life ; (he then be- 1
gan to fhevv some symptoms of Yeturning a- 1

being informed that (he was fafe, ftie seem- |

From a London Paptr.
Last week a wedding was solemnized at
a village near Stamford, which was attend
ed by -some fingolar circumstances.*âA
young man having paid his acldreffes to a
female in t>he neighbourhood (for at least
nine months,) it became requisite he ftiould
marry her. He accordingly summoned his
friends and relatives to be pfefent at the. con
fummationj this being done, it was necessa
ry to feod for another attendant, and he no j
ltfs a person than the accoucheur.. Agreea
ble to the notice, friends, relatives, and
Dwaor attended; The lady being â¢some
' thing easier, it was agreed they Ihould pro
ceed to Church, which was only across the
way, and that the do&or (hould attend them
as it was not certain wbofc services might
be firft wanted; but for decency the
was stationed in tHe porcli of the church un
til the ceremony was over. On? at
tendants, brother to the bride/newed, dur
ing the service, anxiety, observing,
that if'the parfo.n t vva3 not quick, the child
would be a bastard. There was no necessity
for such great haste, as the lady was not de
livered of a fine boy until early the next mor
ning.
sA new way of reckoningâA sailor marri
ed'a woman, staid with her the firft night,
â¢went to sea the next day, and returned in
three months, when he found her brought
to bed of a boy. Jack stormed, and called
his wife a w ; but the nurse abused him
in her turn for a sea-looby, that he did not
know how to reckon for a woman on shore,
who counts by day and night. * Well, fays
Jack, but that makes but fix months, and
(he ought to gÂ» nine. You fool, replied
the matron, you'have forgot thethreemonths
you were at sea ; only that three
months by day, and three at night, and
three at fea,-make nine months, and you'll
find you* wife an honest woman. Jack
could not follow this calculation and was
obliged to knock under, and allow it to be
all right.
memoirrs or citizen Barthelemy,
Latety chosen Member of the Direftory,
iiv France.
M. Barthelemy, is the nephew of the
Abbe, of the fame name, who acquired such
deserved celebrity by his learned labors,
particularly his "Voyage dejeune Ana
charfe." The uncle was patronized by M.
Choifeul, theprimeminifter of France, whom
he had accompanied while Cpmpte de Stain
ville, in his embassy into Italy. After their
return, young Barthelemy was placed in
one of the public offices at Versailles, and
1 became initiated at an early period of life
into the foreign correspondence of the then
ministry.
His prote&or was a nobleman, who unit
ed very dissimilar and apparently incompati
ble pursuits in his own person. An ac
complished courtier, he cultivated a taste for
the fine arts, intrigued in all the cabinets of
Europe, and was greatly attached to litera
ture and learned men. To him has been
attributed two of the most remarkable and
portentous events of our time, the family
compaa with Spain, and the union of the
lioufes of Aullria and Bourbon by the mar
riage of Marie Antoniette with Louis XVI.
No sooner had Barthelemy attained the
age of manhood, than his powerful iaterefts
procured him a foreign million. He ac
cordingly accompanied the Baron de Bre
teuil to Switzerland, and resided with him
some time afSokure. Thence he repaired
with the fame minifttr to Sweden, witnessed,
and, if 1 niiftake not, afiilted in that memo
rable revolution, the event of-which'has de
monstrated how easy it is for a king, aided
by a (lauding army, a parifitical nobility, i
and a few fplliers cf fortune, to overturn !
the liberties of a nation. (
When count d'Aduelmar was sent ambaf- J
fador to this country, he was accompanied .
by the present dire&or ; and on his return '
to Paris, M. Bartheleiny, who before was
secretary of legatip., became minister pie- \
nipotentiary. He also resided here for a ,
considerable time,- during the embassy of M. <
de la Luzerne. <
In the mean time, a great revolution was '
insensibly preparing in his native country ;
and it was his singular good fortune, not- ,
withftandmg his declared averfioa to- it, to 1
be benefited by the event. His family had 1
been prote&ed by the nollejfe, and both him
felf and his uncle had received many mark* '
of attachment from Louis XVI. It was ,
accordingly imagiued, that he would have |
openly joined the emigrants. One of the '
two things, however, rr.uft have occurred :
either he became a sincere convert to the
principles of the republicans., and afted j
from a conviction of the goodness Â£f their 1
caufc ; or, he concealed his sentiments, and, '
affe&ing to be the open enemy of t}ie roy- \
alifts, lacrificed bis opinion to his ambition. '
It was Switzerland; the school of his jure- ,
nils years, that was destined to be the thea- 1
tre i.'f his glory. There he firft opened the
diplomatic powers cntrufted to him as'mi
nifter of the new commonwealth ; and it is
but justice to add, that he conduced him
felf throughout all the intricacies of his po
litical agency with equal address and success.
When he made his appearance iu the po
litical hemisphere, he was treated with con
tempt, nay even with insult ; but such is
the magic of success, that fame no sooner
began to display her gigantic powers, than
he found means firft to get himfelf acknow
ledged as the minister of the republic, and
soon afterwards to enter into advantageous
alliances with the very states which had beer,
its bitterest enemies. ,
M. Barthelemy was eletled to the direc
torate in the most honorable manner. De
clining pomp and parade, he repaired to Pa
ris by a different route than that expe&ed,
and thus avoided the envy which generally
accompanies popularity. 0Â« his firft inter
view with his colleagues, he publicly pro
claimed himfelf a friend to peace. He is
finee said to have been in a minority in the
cabinet, a9he has Gded with Carnot against
the other three dire&ors, with whom they
hbve differed on almost every fubjeft.
I Mr. Barthelemy succeeded Letourneur in
i the direftorv, who went out by lot ; the
latter has since been employed to conduct
the negociatlon at Lisle.

MALO, and REVEILLIERE LEPAUX.
TheMoniteur haspublilhed a letter which
contains authentic and circumstantial details
of what pafled when general Malo lately vi
sited citizen Reveilliere, the Direftor, to
complain of his being suspended.
The Direftor replied to the complaints
of Malo with much gentlenefsand prudence,
avoiding every thing which might hurt his
feelings, or add to the kind of disgrace he
complained of. The Gen. however, sup
posing thrit the moderation which was dis
played in the Dire&or's converfatiou, pro
ceeded from fear, suddenly changed his
tone. Supporting himfelf in a menacing
air, upen the guard of his sabre, he said,
" It is not to such a Triumvirate that I (hall
surrender my honor and my rank. They
will soon not have it in their power to per
form any more arbitrary aÂ£U. Their reign
will not last long." V
Citizen Reveilliere Lepaux approached
him with a firm countenance, and pushed
him out into his anti-chamber. " Wretch"
said he " because I have spoken to you with
mildhef* and with the greatest delicacy, do
you come tp insult me in my own house
with arms in your hand ? Know, that sa
bres and epaulets cannot terrify me, and
that I entertain no other fear but that of
doing evil. Tell those who resemble you,
and would overthrow the Republicâinform
in particular, your generalsâyou know
whom I meanâthen they are not capable
of intimidating me. It is not easy to turn
aside from his duty the man who fears nei
ther fuffeiings nor death. As to you I
(hould order you to be immediately arretted
for having behaved with insolence to one of
the firft magistrates of the Republis ; I am,
however, still inclined to fliew yau indul
gence ; but retire immediately, and never
set your foot again within my house."
Reveilliere Lepaux is generally esteemed
to be a man of excellent moral charafter and
a firm republican. The royalist prints of
Paris, therefore, have lately been very vi
olent in their abuse of him.

THE age of perfection, like the age of chival
ry, is, wf trust, gone, never to return. Yet it
may still be in the power of a bigoted or felsfh in
' dividual, to render cxilting laws subservient to his
paflions or his intcreft. A charge of this kind is,
â  in th ' present pamphlet, brought against a clergy
- man. We do not take upon as to authenticate the
r charge; but we (hall give the heads of the affair
from" a state of the cafe, fignnd by eight per foes
' imprisoned in Yoik castle. According to this
> Oatemei-t, about the latter part of 1781, or the
I beginning of 1782, Mr. Markham procured a
r futr.mons for some Quakers to appear before the
justices at the quarter sessions at Skepton, to (how
: ciufi; why they did not comply with his demands
' (or f.nall tythes " they obty-d the summons ; thÂ«
â¢ justices deemed the vicar's claim unreasonable, but
; told him, that if he would make reaforable de
j mands, they wouid grant him a warrant to obtain
them : this hs declined ; ahd, after four years,
" commi nosd a suit in the court of exchequer against
" fix person!, only one of whom was a Quaker.â
1 While this suit w:s pending, in 1789, he obtained
[- processes out of the fame court against ten persons
of the pei suasion called Quakers. The defendants
' stated their religious' fcruplcs against complying
" with any demand of this nature; men ioned the
- summary, and comparatively easy mode of pto
-1 ccedirg provided by aifts of parliament ; pleaded
that thJyhadat no time refitted the t :Ung ofgeols

After fevaral st!tmpt= top.ifftnde'tHc c;

BE AT on, pruuJ Billows ; Poreas, b'ow ;
Swell, cyrled waves, high as Jove's roof;
Your incivility c'oth Alow
That innocenee is tempest proof;
Though Nereus frown, my thoughts are
calm; 1
Then strike, Afflidlion, far thy words jre bilpi
That which the world mifcallj a jiil,
A private closet is to me;
Whiltt a good confidence is rtiyhail,
And innocence my liberty ;
Locks, bars, and solitude, together, me',
Make me t\p. prisoner, lyat an anchoret.
I, wbilft I wifh'il to be retired,
Intp this private room was turn'd ;
AÂ« if their wisdoms had
The falamatider Ihould beburn'd'j
Or like those sophists, that would drowii t <ifh x
I am co-rtftriln'd tt? fuffer whit I wilii.
The cynick love* his poverty ;
The pelican her wildernefa :
And 'tis the Indian's pride to be
Naked on frozen Caucasus : ,
Contentment cannot smart; Stoics we let-
Make tormruts easy to their apathy. T
Thcfe manacles upon my arm
I as my mistress* favours wear ;
And for to keep ?ny ancles warm,
1 have foinc i.ori lhacklesthere:
These walls are but my garrison ; this cell, v
Which mea/call jail, doth prove my citadel.

Or, like the great Mogul or Pope,
Am clayiter'J up from public light .â¢

And thu? proud lultan, I'm as j*teat as thee.
Here fin for want of food mult starve,
Where tempting objeÂ£is are not feeti;
Aud thete strong walls do onty serve
To keep lin-out, and k?ep me iu :
Malice of late's grown charitable fuie,
I'm not committed, but am kept feenre.
So he thatftruck at Jafoti's life,
Thinking t' have made his purpose lure>
By a malicious friendly knife
Did only wound him to a cure:
Malice, I fee, wants wit; for what is meant
Mifchief, oftimes prove favour by th' event.
When once my prince affliflien hath,
Prosperity doth treason seem ;
And to make fmoeth so rough a path,
I can learn patience from him :
New not to fuffer (hews no royal heart;
j When kings wani cafe, fubje&s must bear a pari.
What tho' I cannot fee my king,
Neither in person ner in coin ;
Yet contemplation is ? thing
That renders what I have not, mine :
My king from me what adamant can part,
Whom I do wear engraven on my heart >
i Have you not seen the nightingale,
A prifontr like, coopt in a cage,
How doth <he chaunt her wonted talc
In that her Barrow hermitage f
Even then her charming melody doth prove
That all her bars are trees, her cage a grave.
I am that bird, whom they combine
Thus to deprive of liberty i
Bat tho' they do my corpse confine,
Yet, maugre hate, my fÂ«u! is free :
And tho' imÂ«nur"d yet can I chirp and sing
D i (grace to rebel?, glory to my king.
My foul is free as ambient air,
Although my baser part's immtw'd,
Whillt loyal thoughts do Hill repair
T' accompany my folitqde;
A'though rebellion do my body bind,
My king alone can captivate my mind:
