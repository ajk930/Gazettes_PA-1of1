St. JOHN'S, (Antigua) May 1.
The ship William, Captain Atkinfon,
from Lancaster and Cork, bound to this Is
land, has been taken and carried into Point
a Petre. She failed from Cork on the 14th
last, and on the 17th, 7. N. and long. 59,
30, W. in company with the (hip Betsey,
capt. Fleek, from Glasgow, fell in with 4
French privateer schooner of 10 guns, full
of men, mostly American, and commanded
by one Williams an American ; the priva
tefcr immediately attacked the Betsey, which
after some resistance struck, and was sent off
for Guadaloupe, after which an engagement
commenced between the William and the
privateer, and eontinuedfor five hours, when
the latter 1 was obliged to flieer off.
Next morning at day light, the William
fell in with another French privateer Hoop
called the Fox, of 8 guns and 95 men, this
island bearing W. S. W. distant 5 leagues
and engaged for two hours, when falling
calm, the privateer got under the William's
larboard quarter, and boarded her, in con
sequence of which, the Supercargo, and 3
men *pre killed, and one wounded, when
thsjvircre obliged to "strikeâShe arrived at
Point a. Petre the 22d inft.
So \erf near were the William and the
privateer to this island at the time the firm
er struck, that capt. Atkinfon attempted
to throw himfelf overboard as*! swim on
shore, but prevented by the engrtiyâ 1
The William mounted 14 four pounders ]
and 30 men. Capt. Atkinfon arrived yd"-, 1
terday in the Walfingman. | <
* Williams we are informed, brought 1
this schooner from Baltimore, some time , 1
since* under French colours, and procured
a canyniffion at Guadaloupe. He aftswitn
with the utmost cruelty to the unfortunate
men whom the chance of war puts in his
power.-
A gentleman from the Weft Indies, who
lately had the misfortune to be taken by the
French, aflures us, that he is personally ac,
quainted with Williams, whose christian
name is Isaac, a native of Norwich, state of
Connefticut ; and that he has treated some
of his countrymen that fell into his hands
with the grcateft barbarity.

PHILADELPHIA,
MONDAY EVENING, July. 17.
*,* An interview is requested with the author
of the piece fign<;4 A Native AmtritOn."
MR. rENNO,
I request you would publish from the Au
rora a paragraph which appeared on Satur
day with the remarks following it.
From the Aurora.
In the war Speech of the President, he
fays, that it mufl not be permittedto be doubt
ed that the people and the government are one
and thefame. How contemptibly must that
man think of the American people who en
tertains such a sentiment ? The administra
tion are either the paifGns, or the tools of a
British faftion.
ERIWARKS.
The best principles of patriotism diftated
the sentiment which has cavil
ling. The nefarious faftion have labored
for years to persuade the people and rulers
of France that the enlightened citizen* of
the United States were difaffefted to the
administration of their own government. â
They told them so in the firft term of the
Prefideucyot the flluftrious Washington.
At the end of that term, thepeople UNA
NIMOUSLY re-elefted him, and though
this faftion know, that had Washington per
mitted, the people would have AG "IN
UN INIMOUSLTre-eleftedhim, yet they
continue their abuse, their falfehoods and
their lies. The people have elefted as the
SuccefTor of Washington, a man, who, fol
lowing the diftates of his own superior
judgment, and the almost universally expres
sed with of the people, has declared that he
shall pursue the system of his predeeefT r."
" How contemptibly must that man think
of the American people" who " doubts that
the government and the people are the fame ! "
This faftion does not doubt itâthey know
it is a faft, they know that that the people
feel and realise the important truth. The
faftion despair of flirring up the people to'
destroy the work of their own hands, their
constitution, and with that, themselves.
They are therefore employing every artifice
to influence foreign powers to invade this
country. They write and publish and fend
their lies to France, that the people hate
what the faftion hate, the constitution and
the administration, and are tired of and dis
gusted with, the freedom, peace, and pros
perity they have so long enjoyed ! The fac
tion has no hope but from a foreign power.
Bachc fays " the administration are either
the patrons or the tools of a British faftion"
what jargon ! either the head or the tail. He
has repeatedly called the administration the
Faction itself. But who are the men
that compofethe administration ? They are
men who bore aftive and confpicuaus par.s
in that revolution which terminated in the
separation of this country from Great Bri
tain. This calumniator, then a child, was
imbibing those principles in France, which
are now exhibited in traducing the best men
'in America.
1o tht Editor of the Gazette of the United
States.
SIR,
The Chevalier d'Yrujo is much cen
sured in the Gazette of the United States of
Saturday last, by a writer who signs himfelf
Amti icanns, fer having publifhcd his letter to
the Secretary of State. If the crime is in
publishing, has not the government com
mitted this crime before him ? Have we
not seen published in all the newspapers,
with every mark of official authenticity, that
the conduft of the Spaniards demonstrates :
, " That they do, not mean to fulfill for an in
definite period the flipulations of the treaty
and also, " That there is jmuch reason to
believe, Mr. Ellicott's suspicions well found
ed, that an undue influence has been exercised
â  over the Indians, by the officers of his Catholic
: Majejly, to prepare them for a rupture with
the United States," &c. &c.
, Would the Chevalier d'Yrujo have fulfill
, ed the duties of his station, if he had fuffer
l ed these official and public attacks upon the
I good faith of his nation to have palled un-
I \ noticed ? Was it not'incumbent on him to
-! elucidate fafts and destroy conjeftures equal
-1 j ly injurious and unfounded,
f Americanus appears to have very extraor
t dinary ideas of equity and justice. On the
: one hand he does not censure the govern
-1 meni for making their attack public, thro'
the medium of the press; and on the other,
1 he is greatly scandalized, that the attack
j should be repelled with the fame weapon.
5 He goes further, by denying to those fo
-3 reign agents who come across the seas to
r promote the interest of the powers they re
-5 present, the right to defend themselves when
- attacked, in a manner not refufed to any in
| dividual in the United States. A man with
Â» such principles, if he be an American, must;
t be an Anglo-American.
The plain state of the cafe is this. The
: Chevalier d'Yrujo, and the Sovereign, whg/e
â  interests he is sent to promote, have been
1 publicly and severely stigmatized: Why
1 should he be denied the use of the press to
repel an attack through the medium of the r
press ? The faft is, Sir, that those who c
for certain ends are in the habit of acting in t
darkness, dread the light that may be thrown i
upon their machinations by the torch of :
truth. '
It is true, that in countries where the i
press ia not as f.ee as it is here, and where
the people have no fh'are in the government i
it is not usual to give publicity to diploma
tic correfporidencies ; yet there are instances,
even with the monarchies of Europe, in
which considerable publicity has been given
in these matters. In the cafe of Armfeldt,
copies of the correspondence between Na
ples and Sweden were profufely distributed
to powers belonging to the diplomatic corps '
in both countries ; and it was finally printed 1
in the freer countries and published to the
world.
But we are not to look to Europe to jus- <
tify the propriety of publicity, in all go
vernmental concerns, in this country. Here
the government is the'creature of the peo
ple, of course public opinion has prodigious
weight; and if any branch of the public
functionaries attempt to make, by means of
the press, an impfeffion upon the public
mind, injurious to the charafte r and interests
of a friendly foreign nation, it is not only
the right, but it must be the duty of the
representative of that nation to repel the at
tempt in the only way it can be met, âalso
thro' the medium of the press.
This is what the Chevalier d'Yrujo has
done. The conduct of the government of
Spain has been attacked -officially and by
printing, and he has -defended the govern
ment of Spain officially and by printing. I f
in doing this he' has misrepresented fails,
and has not supported them by fufficient do
cuments, let it be (hewn ; or if his deduc
tions from them are falfe, let their fallacy
be exposed ; but in this free country let it
notbe faidj that the press (hall be a weapon
of attack only, and not of defence ; aone
but an Ar.glo-American could maintain such
adoftrinc. VERUS.

More Harmless Duelling.
Notwithstanding the recess of Congress
this amufeihent continues im fafhion, if we
may believe the following information from
Hartford, which dates,
That a few days since, a challenge was
sent by Mr. Collins, of the' Old American
Company, to Mr. Cro(by of the fame com
pany; all was in readiness for procedingto
execution, when the magistrates interposed,
and took the combatants into custody.
The challenger is said to have been tried,
and sentenced to a fine of 3000 dollars, and
one year's imprisonment.
BALTIMORE, July 12.
Extra ft of a letter from Holland, April 23,
1797.
" But there appears to prevail at present
. a design still more pernicious, as it strikes
: direftly at our national union. From the
i I present conduft of the direftory, it cannot
[ \ be questioned, that they are determined up
; ! on a war with the government of the United
1 States. There are also numerous proofs in
â  in the prosecution of this war ; they are pre
â  paring to derive support from a part of the
. American people. The policy upon which
they proceed, appears to be this; that the
- Atlantic, or at least the eaftem Rates, can
' not be governed by the influence -of France,
; ; and therefore, that a southern republic must
; . be formed, in alliance with France, to ferye
1 as a balance against the others ; but iti order
: to foim this republic, France liirift makr
j war against the present government of the
: United States, in the progress of which she
â¢ can fend an army to fopport and assist her
s allies of the new republic, and hereby they
1 will effeft two purposes at once; that of"
1 weakening by division a rising powfcr which
they behold with suspicion and jealousy ; and'
that of disencumbering themselves from a
I considerable portion of the army, the return
of which into France they already dread.
They wish to form a republic in America,
. they are now forming a republic in Italy,
F to provide for the fubiillence of their troops,
r or at least to be themselves rid ps them-âand
> thus you will observe that tlvey step tofcvards
1 war with America, regularly as they step
. towards peace with the house of Austria ;
; they are constantly in expeftation of this
peace, and it will probably be made in the
: course of this ipring or the following sum
mer.
" In one of my letters I wrote that they
' had no idea of fending an army to America,
) and I formed my opinion from the state of
. their marine, and the impoffilnlity they were
! under of restoring it for a long time. But
- various circumlfances now lead me to a dif
) ferent and with refpeft to the ma
rine, they are preparing to turn their exer
. tion towards it, as may be ccllefted clearly
. from the pamphlet of Theremin, which I sent
; you a few days ago."
[ FREDERICK-TOWN, (M.) July 5.
. Extra 3 of a letter from a gentleman at Phila
delphia, dated June 27, 1797*
" No doubt remains of peace havingtaken
; 'place between France and Austria, and I
. hope a peace between France and England
' will immediately follow, for we (hall never
, get right until the event happens.
" The Britlfh nation is in a situation that
will produce important events if a speedy
peace should not take place. The mutiny
in their fleet must be very alarming, and I
have no expeftation that discipline
reftcred during, the war. Their finances are
far from being in a good way; and I, for
i some time, have entertained no doubt of
t their enormious debt, sooner or later, bear
ing them down. The continuance of the
; war would certainly haflen that event. In
â¢ deed a}l Europe mtift continue in an unfet
-1 tied condition for some time after peace is
, agreed on, and we shall certainly derive ad
) vantageous from it, in point of wealth, if we
manage cur affairs with wisdom and pru
dence enough to induce foreigners to fend
their property here: however I am no advocate
for foreigners being admitted to become citi- i
zeris on the easy terms they have heretofore
been indulged in. We' have already expe
rienced great inconveniences from fuffering
people of all natipnsbecoming citizensbefore
they have resided long enough in the coun
try to give them a warm affeÂ£tion for its
permanent intereits.

Whether Mr. Jefferfon did fay, since lie
has taken his present position that " it was
" the intention of Mr. Adams (the Prefi
" dent) and his party, oh the call of Con
" grefs, to declare war against France if
" there had been arefpe&able majority"â
or, whether he had indubitable authority for
it, if he did fay so, is not fatisfaftorily as
certained,âReport fays, two gentlemen of
refpeftability in George-Town, lately aver
red that Major F -told them he had
received a letter from Mr. jefferfon since he
went to Philadelphia, containing the above
sentiments.
Report also fays, however, that a third
gentleman, equally refpeftable, declared,
when he heard it mentioned in company,
that the letter was (hewn, by Mr. F ,
in confidence, and that the above sentence was
not in it; but that it was an improper let
ter.
As the solution of this question may be
gratifying to the citizens at large, at the pre
sent interesting erifis, the investigation is
humbly submitted to Peter Porcupine, Mr.
Bache, and other Critics.
It is supposed that the names of the with
in mentioned gentlemen might readily be had
if necessary. CITIZEN.

Extraft of a letter from St. John's, New
tO- foundland, dated the 22d of May. to a c
person in Norfolk.
" I had ihe misfortune to let dne of my q
in! out-houfes, last fall, to two soldiers, who (it
â rly appears) had been in the habit of Healing p
gunpowder, from the magazine at Fort- c
BÂ°. Townfend. On the 13 of February last,
about ten o'clock at night, as they were p
drying some part of it that had been wet; c
it catched fire and made a most dreadful ex- d'
'/Â« plosion, which entirely demoliflied the buil- c'
ding they occupied, and carried away one r> C
of the chimnies of my dwelfinghoufe, and s '
the part of the other; it also tore away the C
>"â¢ whole of my back porch, and tore to pieces
d *T the beds, See. in one of my rooms up stairs, R
ea. and broke all my windows. But the fate of
er- the unfortunate tenants with whom tfie ac- a
jÂ° ci'dent happened it still more melancholy,â na
, r . three women and two children were entirely r)
to consumed, one of the men was found dead
on the spot where the house itood, the other 311
1 still survives, a most wretched, miserable and t( "

K SIR, . ,
HAVING seen your furitius letter of the
ork â 3 1 May, addrcfled to .your fellow riti
lore Z^n Â®' w ' l ' c ' l y 6 " express so. much refmt
fton mem anc ' â¢â dignaticj} against the presentment
of the federal grand jury ; and having hid
th? honor (whatever you
ork being one Â°f that body myfeJf,T was premp-
Folk tcci an inclination, whish 1 could not easily
wfifl, of taking some little notice of that ex.
ihia traord;nar y epift'e ; though 1 was well perfuv
ded at the fame time, that treating it with a
contemptuous silence would-have Lee it the
lon - I
fy and pitiful a produftion to iis merited 1
ton ob!ivion - . . :
I by no means intend to enter into a po- ,
and litical difcuflipn with you, relative to the (
ore propriety or legality of the presentment ,
which you complain of with so muchâ acri
mony ; butjuft simply 'to observe, that it is ;
ore owing to such worthies as you are, and to c
!al- those turbulent and inflammatory profile- a
the tions, which you, and thole of your politi- r
ifh [ cal complexion, aretheauthorsbf,anyofthat j
bat the people of the United States are opposed j t
lall |to their government, and that in the event l c
ike of a rupture between the two republics, a a
24 j considerable part of our country men would t
declare in their favor ; and also to observe, t
er, ! that it is from their viewing us as thus ppli
ft, j tically circuriiftanced, that they have dared tl
el, jto ir.fult us in a manner that stands unri- 0
yalled in the aimals of the proudest and "
lia haughtiest monarchies. Â£
You ought, I humbly conceive, Sir, as a Â®!
iover of your country, and as a member of â
re the general legislature, to whom your confti- u
j tuents have'entru fted a portion of their hap'- o
I pinefs, to. have employed every means, (cf- â Â»'
I pecially as we have but two marry reasons to &
j apprehend entering into a wai) in uniting ie
I your fellow citizens together'in the defence
1 of their common country, tfifeir lives, their 1 P
liberty, and all that can be dear to them as
â¢g I men. But instead of promoting so neceflary ! ?
and salutary an end, and one so much to be '
y| wished for by eviery -worthy and virtuous '
I American, you have been indtiftrioufly em- j m
â , ployed in taking every step that appeared to 1 , ca
) you as most likely to counteraft it, both by ' u
n attempting to render the government odious j- Jt
I in the eyes of the people, and by endeavour- j 0
k ing to alienate theit Confidence and affedtion I 111
d from that great and good man, who admi- j
niftered it, and also by reprtfenting his fuc- ! rÂ°
I ceilor as inimical to the interest and cause of V:
n the French nation; and consequently hostile
n to the general principle of republicanism. ,
Surely such conduct tends not only to create
. a foreign influence among us, but likewise tp .
e I invite the French to make war upon us, eit
v with every afTiirance of meeting with the
. approbation and good wilbes of a Consider- ca
e able proportion of pur countrymen. View
r I i'ug yon then in this'light, and as guilty of .
those charges, is there any man,in his sober
f senses, who has difce'rntnent rjnough to dif-
1 tinguilh between the incendiaryand thÂ« firm, to '
- I but peaceful lover of bis country, who dues ru '
not abhor you as a traitor ?'"Yoar patriotism alr
1 (if it is not an aÃufe of terrrrs to call it â
1 j and your writings-border on {he wild aitrl
â  incoherent ravings of a madmanâand you
â  rather resemble the fury Aleflo, fcatteriiig arK
> j his feeds of jeal'oufy, inftirreftiori, and con

l -from the-delire oflefitning the independence l ' C i
of private-opinion, a3 you afFed to believe, vu
that I determined befort I set out from ' Â°
home, to' have you presented if I possibly ra
I could : and U fottnd that every member of U . Â°'
the grand jury, with, whom T had any con-?' p pr. r
verfatioh t)n the fnbjeft exaftly coincided ' l!
with me in fentiraent, that you were a fit !, e
j and proper objeftto come und.crtbe cogniz- '''
ance as a fedtral granil jury ; consequently, 1
the inference, that the presentment was the
result of the charge, which was delivered by n " r
the judges, is entirely founded iq error. F W S
will tell you more Mr. Cabellâthere was ari
not one dHTentient opinion among the whole a .
ofthe jury; and that it wSsowjiig to the r
tenderness of one of the only two foreigners
.who served on it, the word unanimous was not V J " c
inserted in the presentment. I will also tell 1
you another thing. Sir, that you muil not
think of imposing npon the goo 4 sense and
difcernmentofAmericansbythetinfelglareof ,Â°*J
virtue and patriotism with which you in vain , lc .
attempt to blind them. The veil, believe '
me, is too thinly spread to conceal you ; r
and such conduit as you pursue, serves but
the more to expose yoti to obloquy and con
i tempt. You accuse usof dreading the French
nation ; but I am of opinion, were : this
charge founded in truth; "we 'should jhave

ice . If is b >" no means aftonifliing that Robrf.
eir pierre continued to live in this Hate of ap
as parent poverty, even when all the treasures
los France were at his disposal. He had, by
be so continuing to live, a sure mode of de
â¢us ro ) affiilants and {Meads who a
m_ matted money, and lived in fine palaces, be
to cause he could reproach them with their
by lnxur y ; a reproach which, as it could neither
us !? c denied, nor retorted upon himfelf, gave
|r _ solidity to every other accusation which he
on | m! S ht brin Â£ a g ai "ft them. Add to this, that
: while all,the wealth of France was at his
c . command* it was of importance to have a
of few millons set apart, which could only, if
discovered, serve as a handle for his enemies.
n> Robespierre seems, from the time that he
te b f came m aster of France, to have made up
to *V S m ' nd ' as indeed all tyrants ihould do,
, g eitller t0 remain at the head of affairs, or
ie perish ; because to flefcend was imprafti
cable. He therefore, took none ofthofe
S r_ methods of securing to hinifeif friends or
3 f fortune which occupied the attention of fu
er bordmate men. His whole Views were con
â {. centra ted in reigning as mailer; and, there
,, fore he afted continually upon the plan of
-s ruling, or falling a facrifice at once to his
ambition.
x When Robofpierre had got rid of Briflfot,
Petion, Condoreet, and the other friends who
u had overt urned the throne of Louis the XV L
â¢ and exalted him, he began immediately to
Â» organize the fyltem of'terror. He put to
death the Qneen ot France, made Sanguina y
t . decrees, and covered all France with com
t miffdties, who had the power of life and
e death, and at whose disposal all property wsÂ«,
, without reserve. Mara', that fanguina y
fcoundrel, who had traineJ up the people of
France more savage than they naturally
j- would have hfc 'me even uuder the conven
tion, became, foimidablejto Robefp r-e ; t -nd
j i is r.eit to certain that he fell a facrifice to
the jealousy of his former friend.âMarat w s
d!,and had many fymptons of being attaikc I
{jy flow poison,, when he was ftahbed by
| Charlotte Cotde. It is firmly believed by
; njany, atid everi he himfelf thought, that he
w.-s polfem-d TÂ»y Robefperre. And there
; are many rcafons for tjimlii g, that the poir
! arl of 'he fanatic who ass fltaated him was
; directed t'V the tyrant himfelf.
One thing ia perfeftly evident thro'the
whole of the life ps Robespierre,' which is,
that he never was turned, either through
pity or friendfhip from any aft, which his
ow.n fafety or his ambition dictated : an'd
- for the proof of this, the manner in which
he sent his friends and aiTociates to the guil
lotine isfufficier.t.
