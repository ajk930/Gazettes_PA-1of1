I informed him,' that on stl form.-rr occa- !
fiors a fi'patate articie hai! i*eeu agiecd to, j'
which appeased to me to a every pur-j
pole tbfy required, and which it was my '
â¢intention, ai the treaty advaucd, to hive '
pnpofed, as proper to jnak? part of this.
The article (tlie firft of the separate ones in â 
th<r treaty of 17$ l) was then reiii } but
they ol jested to it, as not fully meeting
their vieys. It the title itfelf, as
well 3i t< anv which might be suppos
ed to arise from it, that they objefted. I
could fcaiee allow,myfelf to ireat this mode
of reafc&ing fe.-royfly. I endeavoured to
. make tfiefti feel that it was at ,a
mere word that it was creating difficulties ,
where none tx 1 fled; andthat if all the French
monarch* in the courfr of three centuries had
a'lowed tlifs to stand m the preamble of all
treaties and tranfaAions between the two
-countries, I could not conceive, after its
having bejMl uÂ£ed forfolonj; a period with
out any claim or pi"enCoi) being set forth
in c >nfrq<ienc*of it, how it could now af
ftd ei'.her the dignity, security or impor- '
tance of the republicâthat in facl such ti
tles have ever been considered us in'defeafible
and as memorials and' records of former â¢
grcatnefs, and not as pretensions to pretent
powerâand I quoted the titles of the kings
of Sardinia and Naples, 3cc. as examples
exactly in r oint. I argued however in vain, j
* They treated jt very gravely, and made so
ftmg a stand upon it, that I could not a
void taking it for reference, w'oich I tho't
it better to do, than, feeling as I did at the '
moment, to puth the conversation farther.
The second insulated point wis a verf ma- j
terial one indeed, and which, although it |
has been adverted to as a proposal tjjat might 1
poflihly be brÂ»Ught forward, I confcfs came
upon me unexpectedly. It was to aik eithtr
a reftitutioi) of-tbe fliips taken and'deftroytd
at or, an equivalent for tljem.â
They grounded this clajnwfen the Prelimina- !
ry declaration made by lord H o Â°d on his
taking pofleflion of Toulon, and on the i
eighth article-os the declaration of the com
mittee of the fedious to,him. They said,
peace they hoped was about to be re-eftab
lilhed ; that his mdjelty, in acknowledging
the republic, admitteed that a sovereignty
existed in the French government; and of
course that the <hips held only as a deposit
by England, till thi3 legal authority was
admitted, ought itow to be reftorsd. I re
plied,that this claim "was so peffcfily unlook
ed for, that it wr,s impoflible for me to have
been prodded for it in any iolli tsftions, and
that I could only convey my owu private
fentimt-ntn on it, which were, that they;
could not have devised a flep more likely to
defeat the great end of our mission. One of
the French Plenipotentiaries said, that he sin
cerely hoped not ; that without a restitution
3T the (hips, an equivalent might be found
tojeffeft the pnrpofe desired, since their great
objed was, that something should appear to
prove that this just demand had not been o
verlooked by them, and was not left unfat
isfied by us. I told him fairly, I did.not
r I * â¢ Â« -xr- â¢ ' ~ I* '* !"'
or how it could be appreciated ; and that,
considering the great advantages France had
already obtained by the war,, and those (he
was likely to obtain from th# ad of coode*
fcenfion I had already intimated tis majesty
was disposed to make -in order to re (lore
peace, I was much surprised and deeply con
cerned at what I heard. I trusted, there
fore, that this very .inadmiflible fpropofal
would be withdrawn. They feid ft wasnoi
in their power; Snd one of them, from a
written \>aper before him, which he said
were his inft fusions, read tome words t? the
effeA I have already ilatod. â  r,\ sijK;v
Their third quellion was as to* any mort
gage we might have upon !he low countries,
in confeqiieqce of money knt to the Empe
ror by Great-Britain. They wished to
know if any such existed, frnce, as they liad
taken the low coutitrits charged with all
their incunibrinccs, (hey vi;ere tp .declare'
that they (houtt not consider themlelves
bound t'oanfwer any mortgage . giver, for
money lent to the Emperor, fort^piirpofe
of catrying on the war agaiofl them.
I told them, that v.ithotit replying to
this que ft ion, fiipj.ofi'ng the" c..fe to ex'tft,
the exception they reqjirld should havs-bten
slated in their treaty with the Emperor, and
could not at all be mixed op in ours ; that
if they had taken the low countries as they
flood charged with all their incumbrances,
there co\ild be no doubt what these words
Â»eant ; and that if no exception was stated
in the firft inftajice, none could be made with
a retroaf'.vc
The French plenipotentiaries, however,
were as tenacious on this point as on the o
thcr two ; and as I found to every argument
I used that they constantly opposed their in
flrudlions, I had nothing to do but to de
sire that they vu>uld jjp've me a written pa
per, dating their three claims, in order that
I might immediately tranfiuit it to your
* lordship ; and on this being promised, our
, conference broke up.
Between four and five, P.M. 1
received the inclosed note (N0.16), and I
have 101 l no time since it is in my pofleflion,
in preparing to fend away a meflenger, as

From the French lHmipotentiaries to lord
j Malmejiary, dated l-'Jl'-
d The mmifters plenipotentiaries, of the
s French republic lose no time in complying
with -th-* with exprefled to them by the min
,j ifter plenipotentiary of his Britannic majesty
[[ by trar.fmitting to him a note on the three
0 points which were the fnbject of their confer
g ence this day.
1. They have positive orders to require
h the renunciation of the titleof king of France
r. â  borne by his Britannic majesty. Lord Mai
; mefbury is requested to obfervethat the qÂ«ef
|_ tion is not only a renunciation of the rights
e which might be pretended tobe derived from
r this title, hut further and formally of the
t title itfelf. The eftablifhmentof toe French
republic, and the acknowledgement of thrtÂ»
, form of government by the king of, England
1: i not allow of bis retainig a title which |
q would imply the exigence in France of an or
der of things which is at an end.
t 2-.' The miniliers plenipotentiary of the
c republic are ordered to demand the reftituti-
I on of the veflels taken or destroyed at Tou.
j ion. 4'
t i Great Britain has publicly and formally
1 1 declared that thsfe veflels were taken in trust
e for the king of France. This trust is sacred.
r It inconteftibly belongs to the Republic,
j which exercises the rights and the sovereign
ty that Great Britain attributed to Louis
k j XVII, at the period of the capture ofTou
, lon. Mis Britannic majesty cannot, there -
e fore, in acknowledging the French republic
deny its right to the restitution required, or
to refofe either to make the restitution", or
to offer an equivalent for it.
_ 3. The minifter6 plenipotentiary have or
y ders to demand, and do demand the renun
f ciation, on the part ofhis Britannic majesty
t of the mortgage on Belgium.
s That countiy was mortgaged for the
loaus made by the Emperor in England. It
has become an integral part of the French
e republic, and cannot itmain burthened with
j 1 such a mortgage.
r Theminiftersplenipotnntiaryofthe French
republic request lord Malmefcury to accept
the aflurance of their high consideration.

No. 18. Dispatch from Lord Malmefbu
ry to Lord Grenville, July 16, containing
_ an account of the special confarence which j
, he held with the French plenipotentiaries
j en the 10th inft. the objeÂ£ of which was
j to resume the difcuflion of the article of the
. projet, to which the latter had obje&ed in
, their last conversation. One of the pleni
r potentjaries, who obftrved thil, then par
. ticularly mentioned the nth article, and
exprelfed their repugnance to the renewal of
j the treaties therein mentioned, from various
> reasons ; First, because most of therfi were
j irrelevant to the present negociation ; and
j tecolidly, because they were in contradicti
on to the- new order of things in France,
T by acknowledging the King of Great-B.i
tain as pofleflitd of a portion of the â¢ regal
5 'authority of France.',' To this one of his
[ colleagues added, a protestation, that their
4 oply objeft in wishing not to reniw these
treaties, was to give permanency to that
> which they were aboitf forming: that by
. adopting such a number, en majfe, without
t examination, might hereafter oecafion dif
. ficultics. To whieb she Britith minister re
. plied, that the treaties alluded to were
. the-only acknowledgments of the tenure by
t Which the sovereigns of Europe, and paT
r trcularly the French Re-public held their
r dominions, and had become the law of nati-<
ons, it was unwise and unfafe not to renew
1 them in the present negotiation. A " con-
I ciliatory and even amicabJe ? ' conversation
ij tnfued : The French ministers being wil
ls ling to renew such of those treaties as were
1 cojjneftcd with the Condition of Europe,
c} and the Britilh detirous of adopting them
d in tola. They parted to meet again on the
y fame fnbjed. '
a No. i<jf. FrxÂ«n the fame to the fame-, da:-
)8 ted at Lifte, July 16, mentioning the rÂ£-
jf ccipt-ofa n t >te from the French plenipoten
tiaries, (which is Iketched in No. 20) to
â  r which he returned, No. 2t, to which No.
12 is a reply.âA conference was the con
â y tequende of these notes.âLord Malmefbu
ig ryrjpentd the conv<rrfatiÂ«n by observing that
I- it he npderrtood the intention vfthe Direc
itf tbfy it required as afine qaa preliminary, that
(h his Britannick nmjeity (houW rtftot* toeach
er and ailio# 1 liis fueinie j every thing tltat had
lie been conquered during thi ww. If he was
correit in this idea, it would not anlv pre
rÂ«nt the treaty from beginning, but would t
Jtprivc his majesty as njeans of treat- ( t
inj( ; for it could not be. cipecled a treaty, r.
of all cefiion and no compilation would e i
v?r be agreed to. One of the plenipoten- 1
ri:!r>L*s then afiVred his lordship tiut (o far
from wi'fliing to brealc up the negoeiation, 1
it waÂ» the fincerc wifliofthe DireC\ory that '
it (liou)d proceed haOily, and end fixers
fully ; artjl that jiny proposals which were
not with the'nfacred engage
ments, ftonkl be carefully liftcned toâ
Lord Malmefbury after receiving aflfurances
that the DircdWy would listen to ftiptila
tions of mutual coiiceflion and compensati
on, departed from the conference to dif- '
patch the result to his court.
No. ao. The note from the French ple
nipotentiaries to lord Malmefbury, alluded
to above. It states that having just receiv
ed iultruÂ£tions,and orders from the Directo
ry 01 the fubjeft of his.lordlhip's note, it
is necessary re make this declarationâ
" There in the treatiesby wJbigh France
is allied to Spain and the Batavian repub
lic, articles by which the three powers ref
peftively guarantee to each the territories
poflefl'ed before the war." The Republic
therefore eftabjifhes as an indispensable pre
liminary of the negoeiation with England,
the consent of his ljritannic Majesty to.the
restitution of <*ll the pofleffions which he oc
cupies not only from the French republic,
but of those of Spain and Batavia. The
French plenipotentiaries in consequence of
this, defirelord Malmefbury to explain him
felf with regard to the fubje& of restitution
and if he is not fufficiently authorized to
consent to it, to fend a meflfenger to his
court to procure the necessary powers.â
The conference for this day was deferred on
account of this communication.
No. 21. From lord Malmefbury in answer
to the foregoing. He declares himfelf not
authorized to accede jto the proposition con
tained in their note ; but that in order to a
void the poflibility of mifunderflaadings on
so iiaportant an occasion, solicits an inter
view for to-morrow, after which he will
dispatch a mcflenger to hi' 3 court.
No. 22. From the French plenipotenti
aries agreeing to the proposed conference
for to-raorrow.
Ng. 23. Dispatch from Lord Grenville
to Lord Mainacfbury dated London, July
20, 1797. It begins with exprefling a con
cern at being obliged to observe that the
claim of the Freneh plenipotentiaries is so
extraordinary in itfelf, and so inconsistent
with their former profeffions, as to afford
but little hope of a hapjiy termination of the
present negoeiation. Althongh the most
natural step would be te terminate at ouce
a negoeiation which, on the footing propo
sed by the enemy, precludes the poflibility
of mutual concession and restitution ; yet
as the French pleaipotentiaries have intima
ted a willingness to listen to proposals of re
ciprocal restitution and compensation, and
in order to leave untried nothing that can
promote the return of peace, it is his ma
jesty's wifti that at the next conference your
lordship represent to the plenipotentiaries of
the French republic, thtt " France, treat
fng in liC * duress tiuÂ«
ant* swtme cjvnnot, with any pretence of
jufticfe or fairnefs, oppafe her treaties with
| them as obstacles in the way of a reafona
] ble proposal of peace in whieh they are in
| eluded." "It never can be allowed, that
j France, Spain, and Holland, negociating
1 jointly for a peane with Great Britain, can
set up, as a bar to our just claims, the trea
ties between themselves."â" This princi
ple even if it wtre admitted,, to operate
could not extend to. private treaties, or to
secret articles."- âThen follows a number of I
obfervatiotis to prdve that' this pretence set
up by France is altogether frivolous and il
lusory ; that if ft)e were disposed to nego
ciate, the treaties of Holland and Spain
need be no impediment :âand concludes
with requcfting his lordship to demand of
the republic a contre-projet, explicitly dat
ing the whole of what they have to ask in
stead of bringing, ferward Csparate poists
one after another contrary to the avowed
principle of negoeiation propoKd by thttn
-1 selves. In complying with this demand, to
which they cannot reafohably objeil, the
direftory will placp the business on its real
issue, and bring diftisftly into question the
several joints on which the coQclufion of
peace or the prolongation of war, vrill real
ly depend.
No. 24. From the fame to the fame,
with the fame date. It conlifts of animad
verlions on the affsrtion refpccting the Por
tngueie fliips at Toulon, made by one of the
French plenipotentiaries, and on that ref
pefting the treaty of Pihjitz. Several ob
servations are made on these topics, whieh
having no connexion with the progress of
the negoeiation, but mad? to remove the
mifunderftandingÃ tif the parties,-we pmit.
No. 2j. Difpatcn frqm lord Malmefbu
ry, to lord Grenvijle, July 25, acquaint
ing his lordship, thit in the receipt of his
dispatches, Nos. lb and 20, he had ob
tained a Conference us the French republic,
and related to theip 'in the words of >hja in
ftruftions, that the .terms piopofed as a pre
liminary article, .inadmiflible hy'the
king his matter ; and that having already,
on our pact, freely stated in a detailed pro
jet our conditions, it was but reasonable
that We should expfcA a iontre-JÂ» bjet from
them. On the inadmifiibility of their terms,
one oft the plenipotentiaries remarked, that
they could do 110 mere than " take them
for reference ; that such were the orders of
the dtreftÂ«ry, and rtqitefted his lordship to
state in jvriting the several grounds on wnicli
hisrttfejefty rtjefted iheir proposition.âOn
the feoond point, he conceived that the
bt-ft method for accelerating the bufincfs*
woura be fov the direitory to furnifh his
lordship with a plam of a contre-projet ; an 3
that till further ihffniftions from the direc
tory the negoeiation could not proceedâ
Here his lordship remarked, that he under
stood at a former conference, that the French
plenipotentiaries were empowered to enter
into explanation? concerning mutual reftitu
tion and indemnity ; âif so, he (hould be â¦
happy to proceed to the of any
proposition agreeable to the balls laid down ,
in the projet delivered. After some hesita
tion, one of the French mini&eri replied, ,
that a? the prffent was an important junc
ture of the negoeiation, and perhaps would
be decifisc ps its fate, it would be bed to
i wait an answer on this subject from Pans.
A mutual declaration of w:(hes for a speedy
and happy termination of the negocidtion
followed, and the ministers parted, agreea-.
ing on the propriety there was of each ad
vancing a feparati project.
No, JO. Note from lord Malmefbury, to '
â¢ the French plenipotentiaries. ,
The minitiet plenipotentiary *>f his Bri
tannic majesty his tranimitted to his court,
the;note which was dclivertjto him.tht ijtu
of this month, by the maimers pleoipoten
tiary of the French republic ; and having
received the orders of the king his trader,
on this fubjeÂ£t, he ha ft ens to repeat to tiiem,
in writing, conformably to the dclire which
tliey have expressed to him, the following
refleftioos, which he had already Hated to
them verbally, in consequence of his molt
positive inftru&ions.
Heobferves, in the firft place, that to re
quire, "as an indispensable preliminary of
negoeiation for peace with England, the
consent of his Britannic majesty to.the for
mal restitution of all the po(Teflion6 which
he occupies, as well these of the French
republic, as further and formally those of
Spain and the Batavian republic," is to
wi(h to establish a previous condition, which
excludes all reciprocity, refufesto the king
all compensation, and leaves-no object of
ulterior negoeiation.
That the French republic, formally au
thorised by its allies to negociate the articles
of peace in their name, cannot fairly set up
its partial treaties with them, in opposition
to reasonable proposals of peace, since it is
universally understood that the contracting
parties always preserve the power to modify,
by giutual consent, the conditions by which
they may be engaged to each other whenev
er their common interests may require it.;
consequently the proportion made to the
kiyg of a general and gratuitous refthution
as an indispensable preliminary, would ne
ccffarily impute to his catholic majeflyv and
to the Batavian republic, dispositions far less
pacifie than those which animate the French
republic.
Th J, moreover, in conffqupnce of what pafled id
the fir ft conferences, lord Malmefbury has always
thought himfclf entitled to expe& that the king, his
matter, would find a compensation for the facrifice
he was ready ta> make for peace, in"rÂ«taining a part
of hifceortqueft*; and he was the lelsabie to forefee
any obstacle on account of the fee ret articles of the
treaties which bind the French republic, as the prin
ciple of compenCatioa was acknowledged by a for
mal and positive declarat ion made in the riattie of the
Executive DireÂ£lorv, and communicated in ao oflfc
cial Note, dated the 27th of November, a
declaration posterior to the eÂ©nc ufioa of ihofetici
ties.
It was, therefore in order to remove, as much as
poflTible, every difficulty, that, in the projet of a
treaty which lord Maimefbury has delivered to the
ministers plenipotentiary of rite French republic, the
"alternative was left to France, to fettle thin corn pen
: fat ion on its own*pofieflions, or on those of in all en;
But the absolute refufal of this alternative appears Jo
' â , Ml â  r.. IT.I â  tve
~ ifiuitTcU, and of arriving at an honoraole just and
permanent peace.
1 Lord Malmefbury, persuaded that such cannot t>e
the intention of the French government, hopes, that
in corifequeuce of the rcafons herein Hated, a Condi
tion will not be indited upon, to which his Britannic
m-jefty can by no means consent.
He again retjuefls the romifters plenipotentiary of
the French republic to accept the alTurance of his
high confederation. 1 7

I was verv far from wifbTng for any imp oper haste,
or wot to move in a matter ol such magnitude with

Reflections on Monroe's " View."
No. V.
At mod of this tranfa&lon I am net astonish
ed, as it may have proceeded from violent pre
judice in tavfcr of France, from a diffegard of
the opinions of the executive,and a tUiire to ap
pear allrimpartant in the eyes ofhit favwifena
tion ; but lam aflonifhcd to find, that white
Mr. Monroe insists, and infills with great
pf reasoning, that a compliance with
the treaty w6uld be highly beneficial to France,
amj equatfy beneficial to t lie UhJtAl States, that
he drtl not demand a tomphance. Both ccrtjntri<Â»
being interested hi its execution,'it was inexcu
ftbk not tt> hive demanded it. But he attempts
to excuf'e hiinf'elf by faying he was if raid France
would 1 la've in turn demanded a compliance with
the guarantee flipulatiort. This was a vain fear :
France knew well that the cafus foederis had not
occurredy and in the Hate of the prffent war
and of pulalid aft'airs, that such a demand could
not be made justice or reasonâAbove all,
Mr. Monroe fliould Lave bony? in iniml that his
country ij always animated with the put-eft
feutimtnls of honcv and goodfaitb, and always
ready to meet the slaims of foreign nations, and
by these principles to try them. He should
have reflected that at the helm of American af
fairs was placed a man who well understood
the jnterefts of his country, as well the extent
ot the national engagements ; and he should not
have presumed to negleff or counteract the ob
vious intentions,of the executive. Fiom whence
did Mr. Monroe take up the nation that lie was
not to complain of the decree contravening the
treaty His predecessor temonltrated agaiuft
it: The injuries ariling from it had reached eve
ry part of the comment;. ft was neither the will .
of ihe President or of the people that thry
(hou'd be continued ; wherefore then did he en
courage France tt> continue the system of perfi
dy and depredation ? Why did lit debase his
country at the feet of France, by tellitig the re
public to trample on our commerce, and we
â vould 1 (mile under our indign.ties and JiiiTes ?
What offence had (lis country done him that
he should taketb's severe revenge? Why ftjould
its mieifter prostrate it in the dust by a declara
tion no kfs abjedt -tfian perniciousâby a polity
which, while it expbfed tbÂ« United States to ut
ter contempt, Ivcame the, source ofprefent and
I fear of future ills.
These instances Â®f mifcanduA, being fully
evident, let us next fie what the President did
when they became known to him. It is to be
lamented he had not then difpl ced him. He
only reprimanded him, as appears in his letter
dated 2d December, in following terms:
" lit your letter you fay that you have not been
inftruifted to desire a repeal of the decree which
violated the 23d and 34th articles of the treaty
of commerce: That you did not know but it
had been tolerated from thefoundeft motives
of political expedience, left the demand for the
rel'cindiog ; it might produce a call for tHe guar
antee. Inde'd you have gone further; having
declared in your memorial (hat you were under
no inftruitions to complain of or vequeft the re
peal of the decree authorising a departure from
those articles, and " that if upon re-confideraticn
after the experiment be made, the tommittee
of ftmoM .of
JMfesany solid benefit to tlk-French republic,
the American government, and yaur country
men in genera!, would riot only bear the depar
ture with patience, but with pleafute."
" The fourth head of injury stated in your
letter, (hews that you were poflclTed of cafe*
wV'ch turned eutireiy upon the impropriety of
p the decree K too was .certainly the faft.
; Now, Svitjioyi the abrogation of the decree so
fir as it rei'peflcd cife, ..the red re fÂ» which
vou were ifl'/lruile.! to. demand could not be ob
tained. fri triith, there was 10 caule or pre-'
ter.ee for alkmg' relief but tipdli the ground of
that/decree hitlng'VioUkd thr treaty. Does riot
this view lead Jo the inevitable conclusion that
the d?;ree,ir operative jasftitu#* idlances,' woUld
' be no less difagrfiftibiej.-autl c.onkquently that
its operation iti future instances ought tobe pre
ventedi a circumftjrtcc wjiicll could bs accop;-
, pii(hed only by a totaf repeal ? /he papers of
the ship Laurens rained a reference to.eue or
more representations of Mr. Worrit, against fnÂ«
decree ; so that the Imfiueik bad been atfttially
broken 10 the government. Neither
these reprefeniations, nor yet your application,
appealÂ» to have ftiggafted a requifitioa of th*
Â¥ Kilt, Tiiy pood ft , let tlicfe things be as
tjie.y .will, was it necefliry to intimate thatjtn in
,.lifereii,ce prevailed'in our government zÂ» top
these articles, by a declaration that yov were

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
MONDAY JANUARY 8.
Mr. Morris presented the memorial of
John Stafford and others, praying to have
permission to fettle on a certain traft of land
in the North wefteru Territory, on paying
an aquitable price therefor.âReferred to a
feleft committee.
A mcfl'age wa-! received from the Presi
dent of the United States* inclosing a report
from the Secretary of .State, with a copy of
an aCt of the ftrtte of Kentucky, approving
of the amendment proposed to the Constitu
tion refpe&irtg the fuabilitybf States, and ,
flatitig that as tliree-fourths of the whole
States had now concurred in their approba
tion of this amendment, it mufl be consi
dered as a part of the Constitution-os the U
iiited States.
The bill authorizing tlie payment of cer
tain films of money to the daughters of the
late Count de Graffe, was read the third
time and pafftd 41 votes to 24.
Mr. Livinglton reported a bill in addition
to the aÂ£t fur the relief and prote&ian of
American Seamen, which was twice read
and commuted for Wednesday.
Mr. withed to call" the atten
tion of the heme to a fnbje& which he
thought it wjb time thry rtjoivd take under .
conflagration - he meam the fubjeft of Wil
liam Blount's impeachment. A report had
been made several weeks ago, which had
laid upon the tahle, without any order be
ing taken uppn it. The conduct of Mr.
Blount, as well as of the British Minister,
and others implicated with him, had much
agitated the Public Mind. He had anxi
ously waiud in expectation of the commit
tee coming forward with articles of impeach- '
tnent which the bouse had pledged itfelf to \
exhibit to the Senate; but as they did not
seem disposed to enter upon the business, he
wished to call upon tliero by a resolution.
He proposed tie following:
" Resolved that the committe be appoin
ted to prepare articles of impeachment a
gainst William Blount, a Senator of the U
nited States, impeached of high crimes and
misdemeanors by this House, with author
ity to fit during the recess of Congrefi, be
direfted to report said articles."
Mr. Harper hoped this resolution would
lie upon the tabic. The chairman of this
committee (Mr. Sitgreaves) it was well
known, had obtained leave of ahfince for
ten days. When he returned, thrreport,
he believed, would shortly be made.
Mr.Dawfoneouldnotbutobje&tothisrefo
lution. No one was more anxious than he
to have tht bufiuefs brought forward. One
of the committee (Mr. Harper) had given
the true reason for the delay. Before the
chairman obtained leave of absence, he him
felf had frequently applied to him to call
the committee together; but, a variety of
other business had prevented him from do
ing so. At this time another member of
the committee (Mr. Bavard) wag ahfgntâ
only three members of the committee were
in the house- The house mull, therefore,
either add frefh members to the committee,
or wait the return of those who were ab
sent.
Mr. M'Dowell was aware of the absence
of the chairman of the committee, and had
waited till the period for which he had as
ked leave was expired, before he brought
forward his motion; but having been infor
med that he bad been frequently applied to
bring forward the report, as he had delayed
to do so, he thought it proper to take this
step in order to hasten the business.
Mr* N. Smith was surprised, that, after
the gentleman who moved this resolution
hud eonfented to the leave of absence for,
the chairman of this committee, he. should
have brought forward his motion. Tf he
had intended to bring forward this propofi
tien he ought to have refufed him leave of
abferrce.
Mr. M'Dowell said, he had no other
view in making his motion than of bringing
the fubjeft before the house ; but if the gen
tUman from Conne&icut would examine the
journals, he would find that five or fix days
had pa ft si nee the pf-riod was expired for
which leave had been obtained for the chair
man of this committee ; and if gentlemen
chose to abfeut themselves from their duty,
it was no reason why the public bufijiefs
should be delayed.
Mr. Thatcher called for the reading of
the jeurnal, by which it appeared that Mr.
Sitgreaves obtained leave of absence on the
26th ult. for ten days.
â¢ The resolution was ordered to lie upon
the table.
Mr. Dwight Fofler, from the committee
of claims, made a report on the petition of
John Frank, a soldier, who was captured by
the Indians on his way home, afttr he was
discharged from the service of the United
States. The committee recommend that
the petitioner (honld be paid, during the
time of his captivity, the fame as if he had
continued in the service of the United States
-âCommitted to a committee of the whole.
Mr. Coit moved the order of the day on
the bill for the relief of the legal repieftn
tatives of certain dcceafed officers and sol
diers ; whtcfi being agreed to, the house
went into a committee of the whole on the
fubjeft, Mr. Dent in the chair, when the
bill was read as follows :
" Be it cnac'.fd, &c. That the representa
tives of such officers and soldiers of the ar
"myof the United States, as difcd after the
twenty-fourth day of March, in the year
one thonfand
and before the third day of November in the
fame year, (hall.be entitled to all the emolu
ments to which the said officers and soldiers
would reflectively have been entitled, if
they had lived to the end of the war be
tween tlv United States and Great-Britaiu ;
and that the accoitntiug officer? of the trea
sury, be, and they are hereby nuthorifed
anddiredted to allow the claims of such re
prefsritajrvej, on application and proof
â  m-ide within the term of years
from the pafSilg < ; f this aft."
Mr. B'ount- laid he never could fee any
reafor. why the rejjrefentatives of soldiers
who died in the service, ought not to have
the fame commutation of lands .is those who
Were slain by the enenW, finee the loss wa3
the fame to their surviving friends. He had
before attempted to introduce this principle
into our laws, & tho' he had been unfuccefs
ful, be wi!hed again to take the fenfeof the
committee of the whole upon it, and pro
â pofed an amendment to this effeift.
This motion was 6ppofed as being in it
felf of a queilionable nature, but more par
ticularly-a* being unconnefted with the pre
sent bill, which, it was said, went merely to
I determine the time at which the war ought
to be considered as at an end. The mo
tion was at length negatived; there being
only 7 votes for it, 'â¢
Mr. Pinckney moved to ftvike out the
24th of March, and to insert in its placethe
11 til of April, the day on which hostilities
ceased, and whieh he considered as the pro
per termination of the war. He could not
fee with what reason the 3d of November :
had been fixed upon ; it was indeed the day
upon which congress discharged the army,'
but it could not be considered as the day on
which the war terminated.
Mr, Livingfton called for a division of the
question ; firit to agree to ftrifce o%t, and
" then to infest.
Mr. Dwight Foster seconded this motion.
He was not convinced thai it was necessary
to interfere in this business at all, as he was
not certain whether more injury would not
be done to the community, than would o
ver balance any benefit which might accrue
to individuals by the proposed measure.
This bill, he believed was intended to relieve :
two individuals w'nofe petitions had been be- |
fore them. He prefuÃned there might be!
several others in the situation. The cafe of
Mrs. Alexander, whose husband (Major-ge
neral Sterling) died in January 1783, had
lately been before the house. The provis
ional articles of peace were signed in Novem
ber preceding. The accounts of the offi
cers and soldiers of the army were fettled
up to the jd of Nov. 1783 ; but there
Were a number of cases of persons dying and
leaving widows and orphans, betwixt the :
period of signing the provisional articles
and that period, who had received, agreea
bly to the provision in such cases, feren years
hglf pay. But if this bill were adopted,
these widows and orphans might many of
them again come forward, and claim a com
mutation of land. He did not suppose it
was the intention of the house to invite all
these accounts for a'frefti settlement ; if it
were, he should wi(h an earlier period to be
fixed upon than that proposed.
Mr. Evans proposed to strike out all the
"bill after the enafting clause, which he con
sidered as being somewhat contradiftory, in
order to introduce words which went ex
pressly to declare the period of the termi
nation of the war.
Mr. Gallatin waseppofed to this motion.
He cbniideveel tire war as terminating cither
on the day on which the provisional articles
were signed, or the day on which the defi
nitive treaty was executed. The prelimi
nary articks were signed on the 20th of Ja
nuary, 1783 ; but if the committee insert
ed this day, it would not answer the pur
pose of the petitioners, who prayed for
commutation, as that was not provided un
til the 22d of March, 1783, and of course
officers dying before that time could not
be entitled to it, but to half pension. What
day, then, should be fixed ? It would be
improper to fix any time,he said, as the con
clusion of the war ; the committee might
agree upon any period for the comp<yifati
on of our citizens. But did nothing else
he asked, depend upon Congress fixing a
period at which the war ended ? SitcJiSde
termination would very materially affeÂ£t the
. provifioas of the treaty of 1783. It was
not ourintereft to determine the war fended
at an earlier period than had been afted ti
poni He thought the 24th of March the
belt time which could be fixed upon, in re
lation to our own army, as it was the day on
which Congress received the firft intimation
that peace existed.
Mr. Allen moved that the committee rife
and a fit leave to fit again, in' order to obtain
farther information 011 this subject.
Mr. Varnum was opposed tothi* motion
he thought the quetlion might as well be
. decided now as hereafter. He did not
think it prudent, when Congress had deci
ded any . important question, to agitate it
anew, except there wJI some good reason
for it. Congress had determined the war
1 to close on the 3d of November. He tho't
the war could not be considered as closed
t until the definitive tfeaty was signed. He
f should, therefore, be against {he bill alto
gether, as he thought Cbngrefs might as
' well fix upon any other day for the termi
nation of the war as the 24th of March
; or I' 1? 11 tli of April. He did not know
but there would be as much justice to in
clude persons who died after the provision'
al aiticles were signed, or indeed all who
died in the feryice, as to include the per
-1 sons proposed to b* covered by this bill.
Mr. Macon seconded the motion ; be
' canfe, when leave was asked to fit again, the
sense of the house could be taken whether
! leave would be granted for a further Confide
| ration of the buliiu fs. The end of the.war
t had been determined, he said, by a competent
â  : authority, by that authority which had en
- Â»lifted the soldiers and commissioned the of
ficers. This day was the 3d of November.
â lf this bill puffed, it would prove an opening
, 1 wedge to all the old fetllemtnts, The pe
; tition upon which this business was brought
| forward, he allowed, war. a hatd cafe ; but
I after a decision had been acted upon for four
; teen years, he did not think it would be
proper for them to fay been
tr.iftakeri in this important matter.
After a fewobfervations from Messrs. Coit
! Dayton and Otis, against the motion(ri the
â  course of which it wis asserted that Con
*
greis never made any declaration as to the
terminatieh of the war but that the 3d of
\ November was merely the day on which the
army was dffbanded)and a few words from
Mr. Livingfton in favour of it, the qttsftion
for the committee's riling was carried, there
being 47 votes for it. And the motio-fl for
leave to fit again was carried 42 to 30 f
A report was received from the Secretary
of the Treasury, on the ful.jeÂ£t of excepting
certain claims from the operation of the limi
tation a&s in confeqtienceof a resolution of
>the house of the 14th lilt, which was refer
red to the committee of the vvhiile on the
fubjeft. 1
AnotheJ report was alio received from
the fame department, inclosing ilatements j ,
of goods, wares and marchandize imported
into the United States, for two years, from 1
the rft of October 1794, in purfuanc* of a
resolution of the houle of the 3d of March
lalh Ordered to be printed.
Mr. Livingston, from the committee of !
commerce and manufa&ures, made a report
on the petition of the wharf-bolders, See. of
! Charleston, stating that the committee'had
| found that the practice of wharf-owners em- '
; ploying persons to weigh goods, had been a 1
great inconvenience both to importing
merchant and revenue office rs ; that fntheir
opinion the.claim of the wharf-holders was
unreasonable in itfelf, and ftibÂ»erfjve of regu
larity, but as fufficient means were taken to
prevent any future interruption ofbulinefs,
they ftippofeno interference of the legislature
was necessary.
Also, on the petition Natltaniel Cutter,
who had exported certain "goods from the
United States, buc which, from a variety of
untoward circumltances, were brought back
again to the United States, and were fub
jefted to another duty. The committee de
not think it a cafe in which relief can be
granted.
A'fr, on the-petitions of William Dixon,
and other*, praying tolie rsimburfed certain
forfeitures incurred by omiflions and infor
malities with refpeft to the registering of
veflels. The committee decline recommen
ding relief in these cases.
The consideration of the two former re
pÂ«rts was postponed till to fnorrow ; upon
the latter no order was made.
Mr. Kittera alked and obtained lleava of
absence for eight days.
Mr. Dwight Foster moved that the Com
mittee of Claims have leave to report by
bill orotherwifc in the cases of claimants to
be placed on the Pension LiftâAgreed.
The famÂ£ gentleman also moved that the
petition of James Maury, Consul at Liver
pool, be referred to the committee who has
under consideration the fubjeft of ad
vances made by Consuls abroadâAgreed.

Gkneral Post Officz, ")
Philadelphia, December 18,1797s j
tuthScsti 4thF
New-Theatre,
December 11, 1797.
THE Managers particularly request the con
currence of the public in the abolition of a
euÃodi, which has hitherto obtained, of giviwg a
way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at the
Theatre.
They are a.:vare that gentlemen are unconfjious
of any wrong done to t ie interest of the inlttu
tion by this prailicc, from a general, though mif
tiken idea that Checks are the representatives of a
right to so many feats in the Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will;
when in fact, tfiey were never intended as more
than tokiru by which the Door-keepers are enabled
to ascertain with the least trouble to the parties, th-tt
the-j them/elves have been before in the Theatre, or
paid for their adroiflion.
Independent of the injury the Managers fufiain,
such a practice encourages a croud of idle boys and j
other disorderly persons to surround the doors of |
the Theatre, to the sorruption of their morals and j
the great annoyance of the Audience.
It has also fieen thefource of two evils of no in
csnfiderablc magnitude; one is, that fumetimes
very improper company is by these means admit
ted ; and the that owia a to Checks palling
into dilhoneft hands, they have beun frequenaly
counterfeited to a large amor.iit far the purpofesof
Sale
This ftiTtenient will, it is refpe-Slfutly hoped, in
duce the public to discourage such a traffic : and
the exertions of the Manages win, i/thus affifled,
easily pÂ»ove adqquw to it? entire abolition.
