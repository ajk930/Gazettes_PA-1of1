From tbe process ifiued by the committee profc
of the house of Representatives, it a'ppears lÂ£nc<
that the resolutions of the house under which such
the committee aÂ£ts, are as follow :
" Resolved, that a committee be appoint- fult<
ed to prepare and report Articles of Im- venl
peachment against William Blount, a Sena- and

of high crimes apd misdemeanors, be au- bad
thorized to fit during the recess of Congress. Ma<
" Resolved, that the said committee "be ' n 1
inftrufted to enquire, andbyall lawfulmeans, re P
to discover the.whole nature and extent of Sta
the offence whereof the said William Blount
stands impeached, and who are the parties P en
and associates therein." ' lav
Hence it cannot be true, as stated in some not
papers, that the powers of the committee the
are coÂ»fined solely to the impeachment of ra /
f William Blount, or that they have no au- g' v<
â¢ thority to enquire into the condutt of any vvh

I HAVE been led, Mr. by the L n
perufalof a letter addressed by the Minister
of Spain to the Secfetary of State, through
the channel of a public print, to lament that
the Constitution of the United States con- j
tains no provision against such publications. . ,
This letter, which is at once a gross abuse
of official situation and a mean of diflemi- (
nating the poison of foreign politics, con- '
tains sentiments, so exprefled as, to outrage
decorum, and insult the constituted authoi i- at j on
ties of our country ; and calls loudly for ttent
the prevention of such indignities in future,
It deVnands from the People of America a
1 severe and unreserved reprobationânay, it
7 requires of them, if they are jull to them-
- selves, such inftrufitions to their State Legif- j t
latures and to their Representatives in Con- â¢
grefs, as iriay procure an amendment to the , * , t -
Federal Constitution, which (hall effeflually j
. protect our Government against the info- !
s lence, arid our country against the injury of | (t
1 such unwarrantable proceedings. I j
Much too long have we been abused, in- j eUe]
. fulted, and injured by appeals from the Go- er c
r Vernment to the People of the U. States, â¢yyj ]C
and much too long has the forbearing Ipirit .
is of America submitted to these reiterated Â° ,
. wrongs, on the part of some foreign agents. (

their limits, and, cealing to believe, we may

to agentlemau of this city, June 11, 1797. 11
J g"t 4< p a p ers }j ave informed you how c
Congress has been employed since their v
ma X meeting. That we have talked much, but p
an done little. A view of the majority on the c
votes of the answer to the President's t
ates ! speech, and the coiiduft of many of that y
majority since, prove they were not all feri- 1
ous in the promises they then made. The '
rtU S B answer was firm and strong enough. Our I
0 situation at this time demands such a tone ; '
and if* the sincerity of .our declaration had
0 been evidenced by subsequent mcafures, we
v " n " might calculate upon much good resulting 1
f roin such a conduft. Though there has '
beeii much mutual crimination in debate, as
Â° to the views and motives of party, as also
5 much personality, I would willingly hope,
e as we must all be interefied in, so we must J
wi/h, for peace. We, however, differ widely '

arisen from a misconception of our real cha
racter. Thinking as Ido with those gen
. tlemen, we believe that every honorable ef
ay r. f or t fliould be made towards an amicable
{t r' accommodation of our differences. That,
in the mean time, we should adopt such mea

J RUMOUR
Was current on Sunday, which, though
we could not trace to any authentic source,
and do not credit ourselves, yet as it is still
circulating without contradidtion, it may
be proper to state. It was, that a mutiny
had broken out at Gibraltar, on board the
Culloden, British 74, on the receipt of the
firft news of the difhirbance in his Majesty's
{hips in England ; that by the exertions of
the officers, assisted by Persons from the
shore, it was quelled, affi the (hip proceeded
to sea ; That at Sea, the mutiny broke out
afrefh with greater fury and more fuccefsâ
that the captain was hung, and the lieute
nant, with threats of immediate execution,
obliged to condudt the ship to Brest.
A little more French Fraternity.
Yesterday arrived the (loop HopeftillJ

Capt. Gibbs was brought too by a Frencfi
privateer schooner of 90 or'loo tons, undift-
English colonrs, she boarded him under Pol
tuguefe colours. After the examination <jf
papers, capt. Gibbs was ordered on
the privateer, and threatened with death irf
oase t>frefufal. He. was fhamefully abused,
kicked and beaten, While he was on board
the privateer, theÂ«freebooters destroyed or
carried off every f&per beloaging to. the Su
percargo, and Mr. George W. Duncan,
3nd threatened the lives of all on board, if
they did not confefs the property to be Bri
tish, or objected to their condudt. They
took command of the decks with drawn
knives, daggers, axes, &c. They hauled
down the Sloop's colours, sent them on
board the privateer, said the sloop was a
prize, and that she would be in Porto Rico
before the next night. They then pro
ceeded to break open every chest, trunk,
&c. and went to plundering with drawn
daggers. From the Supercargo they took
45 gninea6, and nearly all his cloathing;
from the captain ibout 125 dollars, a box of
chocolate, and a trunkcontaining his cloath
ing, books and charts ; from Mr, George
W. Duncan, passenger, all his papers,
pocket book, and some cloathing ; and
from Mr. James Bird,, the mate, mod of
his cloathitig. They likewise carried off all
the cabin furniture, small flores, spare rig
ging, &c, and to complete their infamy,
stripped the seamen of their cloathing.â
The sea running very high prevented the
hatches being opened. The privateer af
terwards made fail with a black flag flying.

Mr. ELIPHALET PEARSON,
Corresponding Secretary of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences.
SIR,
IN the month of December last, I com
municated to the public, a number of fadts
relative to the fever which prevailed the last
autumn in the town of Boston, calculated to
counteradt the effedts of publications m the
city of Philadelphia, in which the opinions
of the physicians on the nature of the dis
ease, and the method of pradtice, were gross
ly misrepresented.
My principal objeft in what was then of
fered was, to establish the following
fitions :
I,ft. That the physicians of the town
were unequivocally of opinion, that the fever
originated from local causes.
2dly. That in the treatment of the jdif
eafe, the stimulant plan had not been adopt
ed in any stage of its existence.
3<lly. That the depleting fyftera in ge
neral, had been used from the beginning.â
But,
4thly. That bleeding in particular, was
by no means generally pradtifed ; and that
there were strong rcafons for belieYing, in
opposition to what had been asserted in the
publications referred to, that where it had
been used, the effedts had been unfavorable.
I had then prepared, as an elucidation of
the above, the following history, which may
perhaps suggest some motives for a greater
degree of caution in adopting a rigid ad
herence to system in medical praftrce ; and
furniffi the means of comparing this with
other which have proved epidemic in
variou* parts of the United States.âAnd
I now submit it (as I judged it a more pro
per mode of communication on a profeflional
fubjedt) to the candor of this Academy.
Tjie firft appearance of the difeafc, was
on the 25th of August 1796, in a family
at the south-easterly part of the'town of
Boston, near a considerable extent of flats,
wliicV are daily exposed for some hours to
the adtion of the fun.
A lady of this family was the firft' vidtim
of the disease. She was seized with rigor,
a general distress throughout the whole sys
tem, with a white and moist tongue, dry
skin, frequent and weak pulse ; but without
any very until the third
day, when the pains which now became
more severe, with laborious respiration, a
flight redness of the eyes, a sleepiness, and
insensibility, followed at night by a sudden
finking, and intermiflion of the pulse, an
nounced the extreme hazard of her situation.
Adtive cathartics were prefcribid in the
beginning, and a blister was applied over the
whole anterior part of the thorax, but 110
benefit was derived from either, and she died
at the end of the fourth' day.
The next person attacked was a female
of the fame family, . She was taken sick
within twelve hours of the firft, with pains
in the head back and lower extremities ; a
vomiting, which continued incessant thro'
every stage of her illness, great opprefiion at
the breast, a weak and quick pulse, moist
Ikin and yellow tongue. Opium, and calo
mel, with other purgative medicines, were
administered, without having been a mo
ment retained in the stomach : Her pulse
became intermittent on the third day ; and
on the fourth, a fatal termination ensued.
Neither of.thefe patients. had any yellow
ness of the skin in the course oPthejjfickriefs;
there were no re?fons to believe they had
ever been exposed to contagionâand they
both imputed their illness to their having
fit at an easterly window in the evening air,
when heated with exercise.
Oil the 2d of September a son-in-law of
the above-mentioned lady, was seized with a
fever of the fame kind ; and within three
days from that time, hjs wife, and her two
brothers, all of bad been closely at
tendant on:t,b<ir. 4eq6afed. mother-.. .3TÂ»ee
of these Yjrtre treated with -large ami repeat
ed doles of jalap and caloriiel; two of the
three took empties i one of them was bathed
with cold water, dashed over the whole bo
dy on the third day from the attack, aiid
been kept cool they all recovered.
The fourth was in a fituatiou peculiarly un
favorable when attacked j fl.e took such
doses of jalap atld calomel, as were thought
best adapted to her state ; and on the fourth
day fte died.
I would here remark, that in two of these
cases the symptoms were frorti the firlt, more
mild than in those which proved fatalâthat
they were deilitute of some of the alarming
symptoms with which the others were at
tendedâhad no inflammation of the eyes,
1 nor difficulty of refplration, bht a thicker
fur upon the tongoe, wincii.-wa* of a dark
colour towards the height of tlit disorder ;
, with more dillinft pains of the head, back
and limbs, with exacerbations at night ; and
ran on until the eleventh day, before any re
markable 'hange in the symptoms ; after
j which, tne'recovery was flow, as in a com
j mon typhus, and was not completed until
1 the fourth week.
The next porfon whom I visited with the
disorder, lived at Oliver's Dock ; and within
two 'or three days from this time, I \vas
called to five others at the south part of the
town, and one in the neighbourhood of the
firft-mentioned family.
Between this and the lÃth of September,
when I was called to Mr. Newell, the per
son whoft situation excited so.much appre
hcnfion in the town, I had visited about a
dozen others, with somewhat similar com
plaints, but very different in the degree of
violence with which they were attended. In
the former, the flcin on about the fourth day.
became yellow ; on the sixth petechias were
dilcovered over all parts of the body ; and a
most obstinate dysentery, followied by col
liquative diarrha*a. proved fatal ou the Bth.
In many of tlte kittcr, after flight rigors, and
obtuse pain in the for the firft twenty
four hours, togfcther with a sense of heat or
burning at the ftomadiâahaemorrhage from
the nose often took place, and continued to
be a troublesome circumltance for several
days, without any remarkable mitigation.of
the symptoms. In these, spontaneous vom
itings rarely occurredâbut when they did,
large quantities of bile were thrown up from
the stomach, and emetics, or cathartics, in
variably produced the fame effect. The
pulse was generally small and irregularâthe
tongue coated with a faburra of a yellowish
cast ; and the excretions from the kidnies,
were often turbid dnring the augmentation
of the disease, highly tinged with bile, and
fometimcs depositing a copious fediineat, be
fore any thing like a crisis had been discover
ed in the patient.
The crises w<re seldom very sensible or
perfedt; and when present, were commonly
most conspicuous in the excretions of the
fkfli, and the above was the usual form in
which the disease afterwards continued to
appear, with now and then an instance, in
which it approached more nearly to that in
which it Commenced.
â  Intheiirft flagc, emetics were fometimcs
strongly indicated from the incefTant nausea,
which prevented any medicine from resting
on the stomachâbut, generally, a dose of
from 20 to 30 grains.of jalap, with from id
to 15 grains of calomel, even under this cir
cumstance, often answered a better purpose
by difeharging very copiously a bilious mat
ter from the stomach, as well as intestines ;
and by frequent repetition, effected the
cure. , Antimonials were sometimes given
between the dofesâbhfters'were o.ccafionally
appliedâthe drinks were principally acid ;
and wine was forbidden.
The disease, however, unless conquered
by a very early exhibition of this medicine,
often ran on to about the lith day, and
sometimes to the end of the third w-eek ;
and in no instance, after the fafe of Mr.
Newell, did it prove fatal within that pe
riod.
In the three patients whom I visited, the
r cold bath was used in the hottest stage of
the fever, to very great advantage. In two
Cases only, what is called the black vomit,
took place: From the beginning of Sep
tember, the fever was slowly increasing ;
and I find that the number of patients, at
any one time under my care, was greatest in
the firft week of Oftober ; from vvhieh time
it gradually declined, until about the middle
of December, when I believe,it had altoge
ther disappeared.
A very great proportion of those taken
sick, were situated near extensive flats, par
ticularly about the easterly, southerly and
westerly skirts of the town. The place
called Oliver's Dock, where the disease was
mOll prevalent, was exposed to exhalations
from foul substances, lodged about the
wharves and docks of that quarter, with
buildings so construCted, as to admit of but
very iniperfeil ventilation, and with large
numbers of inhabitants crouded together ire'
afmallfpace. \
When the disease firft made its appear
ance, the weather was warm ; in about the
middle of September, it became coolâ
, plentiful rains having previously fallen ; and
as the cool wfcath<?f advanced, its violente
and mortality Were gradually diininifhed.*
In most families where one person had
been fi'ck, others were soon taken down with,
the disorder ; in some, allmoft every adult
person became ill } the" children generally
escaping. I knew of no instance of any
black person being infefted.
The disease, as far as I
was, as often-contraded from
it lightly, as .from those who had it in a
more dangerous djegree. In ftverffl families
where one had died, no other person had
received any infection ; in otheis, one
had it lightly, and .several others Â£on.trafted
â â¢it from him, some of then> in the milder
form, and some in the moreft'vere.
-â * Herein it ftcfirs -to difii-r.. frotji w! at I'zs-fce'etr
remarked with rj&pft toly'phws: iclj MrSitefi '
. found to uiereafÂ® < 00l wcather'at'vcnicd,
The mortality of die disease, was by Â£.O
means great ; of" fifty-two persons whom I
attended, nine died ; two of these in eonfe
quence of circumftanees foreign frr m the
disease ; of the number, two were children,
five were womej and two were men.
Prom the best information I can obtain,
not ?bove thirty persons died of it in the
whole season ; several persons were buried
in the night, and this having excited a great
degree alarm in the country, served as a
foundation for the moll exaggerated ac
counts. of the mortality with which it was
attended.
The town was remarkably free frorti
other disorders,. through the whole of the
autumn ; no dysenteries prevailed in it, and
few of the usual diseases of Children.
Whether there is any essential difference
between the fevers denominated bilious, or
whether they vary only in degree, according
to circumftanees under which they are pro
duced, I (hall not presume to decide.
Dr. John Hunter seems to have held the
latter opinion, and it is not improbable,
that the fame disease may have its symptoms
and periods, so much under the influence of
exterior causes, as at times, to bear foine of
the appearances of one belonging to a dif
ferent alafs of disorders: However this
may be, there seems clearly to be a great dif
ference in degree at least, between that
which-has been above described, and the
Philadelphia fever of 1793. Having al
most every fall, seen a considerable number
of cases very similar to the above, not ex
cepting the black Vomit, nor the yellow
Ann, together with the quality of contagion
and other circumftanees usually attendant
on fevers of this denomination, I have becti
induced to believe, that the disorder in ques
tion, was no other than what has more or
leis prevailed, here almost every year, and is
what is properly termed, a bilious remittent
fefer.
That it originated from noxious substan
ces, exhaled igto the atmosphere from putri
fying vegetable or animal matter, or both,'
is extremely probable from the places in
which it was most prevalent, (-(â ) and that
a confined situation, filthy ftateof the streets v ,
alleys and bye places of the town will, as it
becomes more populous, rents higher, and
consequently the poorer part of the inhabi
tants more closely crouded together, fur
ther expose us to the danger of such disea
ses, is a serious truth, which may perhaps
in some future day, be too fatally evinced.
And it may not be improper here to remark,
what is too seldom attended to,i that no
thing can contribute so much to individual
preservation, as personal cleanliness. and by
frequent bathing, Amoving impurities from
the flcin, and promoting a free perfpii^tion.
In cafe of aftual infection, thefickfhould
invariably be feparatfd from the well ; âthe
rooms cleansed and the cloaths washed or
destroyed. J
The success of Dr. Rufh's-prefcription of
the jalap and calomel, might perhaps be
considered,' as a proof of the affinity of this
fever to that of Philadelphia ; but if the suc
cess of the latter mediqine, in the malignant
fpecjes of throat distemper, has been estab
lished, as has been affirmedy ic will appear
the less extraordinary, that it should suc
ceed in this disease, even on the supposition
of its being of a putrid nature. "
If in the common bilious remittent fever
it appears that the use of a&ive cathartics,
and particularly large doses of jalap and ca
lomel, produce the most salutary effects, it
'.vill be an additional fatisfaftion to that
benevolent man, to find a part of his treat
ment of the yellow fever, extended to dis
eases, in which' he had not perhaps contem
plated its efficacy,

â f It has been generally thought that c.oi f inual
fevers are the offspring, only, of human, effluvia.

iufficient realbn, from fomerecent instances of those
difcifrs, for believing, that this limitation decs by
no means generally prevail.
Animal fubltances of which many are to be
found in thrfe places, intermixed with vegetable,
are said to purify when exposed to the fun, more
quickly after having been covered with fait, than
with frtfh water.

Dr. Trotter, in hi# Medicina Nautica, a very

valuable eilfccvery. *
\t i* to be remarked, that all clothing of animal,

sources of infc&ion ; ond, therefore, the utmoll
