gentlemen,
I THANK yon for th : s refpeftful ad
dress. The existence of the independence
of any nation cannot be more grossly at
tacked, the sovereign rights of a country
cannot be more offenfivdy violated, than
fcy a refufal to receive Ambalfadois sent as
Mirftfters of explanation and tfoncord ;
efpeciaily if fnch refufal is accompanied with
public and notorious circumftanees of dtli
-berate indignity, insult ind contempt. In
d'feriminate (!efpohations on our commerce,
grounded on the contemptuous opinion
that we are a divided, defeneelefs and mer
cenary people, are not so egregious and ag
grata ted a provocation offered o a face ot a
whole nation as the former. I rejoice that
you indignantly feel; that you dare resent ;
a'-d that you hope to vindicate, the injured
and insulted character of out common ooun
tr _ when friendfhip becomes insult, or
is permitted only on terms, di&3ted ar.dim
-pofed, it becomes an intolerable yoke, and
it is time to (hake it offâBetter at once to
become g*nÂ«rous enemies than maintain ade-
Jufrvc and precarious comedian with such
insidious friends. Whatever pretexts the

ance. If, by the collateral props of the
monarchy, you mean the nobility and the
clergy, which has followed the annihilation
of them : All their r> venues have been feezed
and appropriated by anoiher prop of the old T
monarchy, the army;âand the nation is ni

Vcoming, if Fiench andfyftems, k
prevail, a congregation of soldiers and cerfu. fc
The French revolution has tverbem inborn- fa
prehenfibie to mc ; the ftibftance of all that b
I can understand of it, is, that'one of the I
pillars of the ancfent monarchy, that is the ir
armv, has fallen upon the other two of the ft
nobility ind clergy,broken them both down ; d
the building has fallen of courses- aitd this si
pillar is now the whole Edifice. The mili- L
tary serpent has that of Aaron I
aÂ»d all the reft.
If the example should be followed thro' v
Europe, when the officers of the armies be- h
. gin to quarrel vtfith one anotherâfive feun- b
, dred years more of Baroni wars, may fuc- Â£
1 i ceed. If the French, therefore, will be- v
â¢ come the enemies of all mankind, by forcing
; all nations to follow their example, in the c
fubveifion of all the political, religious and v
social institutions, which time, experience j
. and freedom have fauflioned, they ought to
. be opposed by every country, that has any
j to principle, spirit, or patriot ism. j
I Floati: g batteries and wooden walls have <
r been my favourite system of warfare and de- I
_ fence for this country, for three and twenty
1 years. I have had very little fuccelsin ina- 1
king proselytes. At tbe present momsnt, ]
s however, Americans in cultivators I
J as well as merchants and mariners, begin to 1
t look to that source ofTecurity and pvotee
a tion ; and your 2ffiftanice will have great in
e fluence and effe<S, in extending the opinion
e in theory and iu introducing and establishing

Your kind wishes for my life and health

In- I. have this morning been on board La

un- face of the figure head of La Pique is nail

im- prize, and makes a strange appearance,
and La Seine had 15 guns a fide on her gun

de- lantly, filicited and obtained leave to go on

ExtraS of a letter from a gentleman at Fort

" A gentleman has just arrived here from
Natchaa, who informs, that there is a strong
party there in favour of the French and
Spanifli governments âthat all the talks
held with the Indians are in the name of
the Frenchâthat the presents to them the
laftfew months have been greatâand that
a large part of the Cho&aw nation are de
cidedly in favour of them, and art ready to
take up arms to oppose us. In consequence
! of which, the commandant at Natchez has
j required a reinforcement. The Indian na
tions to the southward are full of French
and Spanifli emissaries.
" Zachariah Cox is eighteon miles above
t us, with three or four hundred rifle men,
and is preparing to descend the river. The

lence so eminently charafteriftic of the citi !
tens o! Pennsylvania. The fame gen' rous â â 
fi"timtiitÃ which ynu have diTplay dhas in
fluenced the worthy ar.d benevolent citizens
of Bah more ; who always alive to the feel
ings of humanity, have, it app ars by the
public pipers, a. reid to a fubferip'ion for
ther lirf of our dittreffed fellow citizens.
We return thsm a'l the gratituoe and ref
pefl lo which dispositions so amiable are
entitled vâbut it becomes our duty public
ly tÂ« ttate that a fu''d has been providrd for
the purpose, upon the principal of a loan
in anticipation of the liberality a d jutlice
of our Leg:fla;ure, which precludes the
necessity of donations in money from the
humane citizens of our filter dates âC n-
s of prrvifions fro 1 our fellow-ci
tizens in the e untry, as well in New Ji'rfcy
th in our own Stats, have been forwarded
for the use rf the diftreiT-d, with a liberali
ty which does ho-or to the donors.
We fl ;tÂ»er ourTelves that similar donations
will be c< ntit-ued by those generi us indivi
duals, who are contiguous to the ci'y, and
with co-venitnee-fpare a part of their
produce* for the relief of fuffer ng humanity.
By order of the Board of Managers.
