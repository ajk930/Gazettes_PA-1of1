Debate on the Bill ' more eJkltviA fro

United States. I doubt I
(Continued from Monday's Gaze te.)
Mr. MacÂ«n renewed his motion sot ftrik- ,^ e , in '
ing out the w rd " such " The arguments t houfjhi
which had ma e u'e of againll this mo- evrr re(
tion. had not convinced him of its impro- up tlie 1
priety. He did not think it would be a only to
violation of our treaties either with Grat- v,ltl Â°ns
Britain or Spain ; but if gentlemen think
so, it can be amended in that refpett- In-
Head of blaming him, Mr. M. said, certain t h Jn oi
gentlemen ought to be obliged to him for Mr.
having made his motion, because it had tleman
given them an opportunity of making ltudi- confilh
ed speeches, which they otherwise could
not have done. ' m o tio Â°
The gentleman from S. Ca-iuhna (Mr. caM f e
Harper) said his (Mr. M's) conduit Â»n mount
thi occafioD was such as gave the lie to his es nt
former sentiments This was not the most tion of
delicate way of treating gentlemen, but ers
such as that gentleman generally used. It '
would, however, have no effetl upon him.
It wa>, and always had been, his objeft to prjnt,
preserve peace, and as long as he had afi gle tionsy
hope left, he should not wi<h to take any withn
mea r nre to break it. It was with thi vi'w trfÃC
that he proposed bis ameftdfufcnt W make
the bill general. wllf
What orher nations hare done, is not raÃtcl
now the question. The oily question before Beta
the house is, what will it be the interest of our n
this country to do. He knew n<Â» good a pared
repetition of thr injuries we had received g 1 " 01 ; 11
could do. It had been said, we ought not
: to !o any thins* to offind Great-Britain ; c^ptu
as it was probable if we have to fight our tnow
old friends, we might have occasion f r the j s a i
assistance of our old enemies* But, if we Brit.)
are to go to war, he hoped we should depend laden
I upon no ally. He wanted to hslv< no con- .
neftion * ith any foreign nation. He be- , p|
lievfd our last treaty had done us 110 good, t j, at
and he wanted no more of them. He had vVht
" |no objc&ion to buy and fell with-them all, tend
' but he desired to have no farther concern as w
with them He did not think it was in
the power of any of them to hurt us, and <^Â° urs
he would do all in his power to prevent wi{h
foreign alliance', which could never do this 0 Â£ n
country any good, but which might do us pi U n
I great harm. 10
- The house had again been told that the ters
middle and astern.states ;re fafc ? and that
if troops are sent to the fouthrrn (Vates, they . j
will be Lfe alfcr. Mr. M. was.proceeding i Vlh
to fta'e that in the last war no man eaft,ward p ral
of of the Delaware was e.v t seen fighting in . t u d<
the southern dates, and that now the touth-; ing
_ em members (with only one or two exeep- ! fuid
tions) are fatisfied to be left to themselves, *
ns when the Speaker reminded him of the (he|
question. It was complained against that b|Jt
this country was charged of being divided. j
He believed it always would be divided in this
political sentiment. In leed, there is no- a oth
ftatc in the union, and but few neighbor- oty
hoods, which are not divided in this refpeft.
But was this any reason why they would (hc
I not join heartily in the defence of their bo |,
J country, if it were attacked ? However
lÂ». different parts of the union may differ in has
political sentiment, when the question was a of
defence of the country againll invaders, he
was confident there would be no division _
upon it. And he thought it a proof the Ex- for
cutive Direftory did not rely upon any di- tee
Ul * vision in their favor in this count y, or they ,if<
I would not have dwelt so publicly on that it '
pomt. Gentlemen m'ght make use of an tni
o. argument of this kind in this house, in order
5 to catch the popular ear, but if is not true, fui
nor did he believe that there are ten people ns
in the United St tes that will believe it. ri g
I The gentleman from Connecticut ( Mr. WJ
1 Edmond) had said, that if he was sent a as
the commissioner on any business, and one half th<
of the people were to fa that the claims j
. which he went to prefer were not faund d, wj
2- he (hould not expe't any success in h s mil- ag
fion. Mr. M believed it ; but had such a
th'nff ever been said in this country by anv qu
body, mncli lefsby one half of the people : w<
Aby Every b dy believed our claims for rearcis
pply again ft France are well founded.
On the fubjedt of g.ving money, he be
lieved no man would be inclined to stand ou
â as to th, idea of subjugation, he, looked up-
on it as perfectly ludicrous, and
ry to hear a military man (Gen. Shtpaid)
express apprehensions on this ground. He
thought he had known the, spirit of trei
itUd American people too well to have enter
tained such an idea for a moment. j N
Gentlemen have all along denied, Mr. J
â eet. M. said, that this bill is tantamount to a
declaration of war. If it were o. ly inte. d-d
to defend our commerce, according to the
I laws cf nations, it ooght to be nfedf general, J
.Ship as he proposed by &
Coia- but he believed it would be irl effeft a dt- j
5 claration of war. He belrev d tbÂ«f.: who
, frcfli I f _ rtf d It generally intended it lhould J
â¢ ?P r ' Ive that effed, and the reason they had
:; ;i" Â«o.r'fc.of w.â mr
>ppÂ»- ference to making an open declaration of
Goal war is they know i will be more popular I
WafJ than a declaration of war Would have been.
He had no doubt of it. j
He wilhed when gentleman had come to I
1 determination to go to war, they had
brought the question fully b#**
that it might have been fairly determi ed, 1

y I B. believed they were notconfiderable : ahd he j]
d,n ff i believed if the enormity of the aOnduA of f

ided. Mr. B. cowld fee no reason, therefore, why
cd in this bill should be made to operate againfl any J
tto r a other nation than France. It was strange that
tihor obieaions should yet be urged againfl measures i
â  a for the protection of our coafls, though French (
pe 1 j privateers had entered two of our harbors ; yet .
rou . the gentleman from Pemil'ylvania, wi'h that (
tllr ' r boldnefe of affertiq.n so peculiar to him, tells
wever t he hosfe that the Prefidfiit of the United States
'er in has the power to give direflions for the seizing '
was a of privateers within the jurifdiflional line, and <
u r therefure, on that account, this bill is annecef
â¢r fary. But he called upon that gentleman to (hew
v 'Â», on ans . good ground for that opinion. Suppoft,
e E ** for instance, Mr. B said, that a French priva
ray di- , eer was to commit depredarions beyond theju
â¢ they 1 ifdidioal line, and afterwards come within it,
that it would doubtless come within the proviG-ms of
of an tnis bill to afford a remedy i but the gentleman
1 a from Pennlylvania would not fay th.ct the Frefi
Â° dent would have power to afford a remedy m
true ' such a cafe. He had no doubt that when one

it. r j g i, t to take measures againll it ; but this right
(Mr. was lodged' in the sovereignty of tht nation, and

Mr. Brent said, he voted against the a
nveijdment-offered by the gentleman from e( j
N. Carolina, becauie he apprehended its
effcdls Would be toinvolve usin war with cwy
countries instead of one. The amendment
of the gentleman from N. .Carolina .was tfl.
ftrikc but the word such in tW bill, in which
instance the commanders of our armed ves
sels would have been direfted by the Presi
dent to seize and take the vessels of any na
tions that fball have committed, o l ' are found
hovering on our coaftfor the purpofeof com
mitting d predations on the commerce of
the United States. As the bill now (lands,
it will only apply ;t(* French depredations ;
if amended propofed it w mid have appli

whose fubj <fts or citizens are unlawfully Ipo

create >he number of foe* w' * whom we
were to engage in hostility. That b-was
accurate in his opinion, that the armed vef
felb of Great t ritain were at this time in
the practice of vio ating uur neutral rights,
seemed to be acknowledged by others, and
particularly by them.mber from Maflachu
fetts (Mr. Otis) who had opposed the a
mendment, wilh a fnggeftion that in the e
â  vent of an open rupture with France, it
might be expedient for us to call in the aid
I of England, and fuppofitig the amendment
7 might have 3 tendency to create irritation
between that country and this, it was lm
\ proper, that at this crisis it {hould be adopt
! ed. This reasoning of the gentleman from
t Massachusetts could only be derived from an
5 admiffian that Great-Britain didnotattlvs
5 time refpeft our n- utral rights ; for, as the re:
Â® amendment only authorized the seizure of by
j veflels spoliating our lawful commercej there m '
could be no danger that such a regulatio an
"t would involve us in war, or produce a cool
i- ness with Great-Britain, without a psevious th
'â¢ acknowledgment that her armed veflels were > n
e ille al y depredating our commerce and con- 0,1
â f fequently wouldtr* affefled by tlie general tli
provision of the amendment, which, instead w
'd of confining our reptiCals to French, extend- "
â r ed it to vefllls of all nations, thus ailiug ar
:e illegally in relation to ours.
e > Thongh, Mr. Brent said, he was not, rÂ«
6 > under any circumtlances, like the gentleman hi
from Maflachufetts for embarking our des
tiny with that of Great Britain in her pre- C
at sent contest with Frauce ; though he (hould 11
es consider such au event, as one of the most lt
~h deplorable which could befall the United Â«
et States; yet he wis willing and even studious g
Ito preserve peace with Great-Britain, not- tl
" s wuhftanding the many injuries we had re ai
n C " ceived from that quarter, on the fame prin- Â«
nd ciple from the fame desire to preserve the k
:f- tranquility of this country, he was opposed
:w to the bill itfelf He considered this bill n
le ' as perhaps determining,the question, whe- â '
,a " ther or not there lhould remain a possibility
of reconciling our differences with the 1
o'f French Republic. He considered this bill
an as probably difpell/'iig every ray of hope d
:fi- which yet remained of a reconciliation ta- c
king place, and. he hoped gentlemen would
pa use a moment btforc thry adopted a mea- f
], a sure so serious and awful. Hfe did not fee |
that we are at present expofjd to any great- 1
â in cr danger, or cur commerce to nny great v
has extent to ravages more considerable, than |
n'y we had experienced for some time past.
j-,'' He acknowledged that our commerce had J
received great and vrpeated injuries frum
the France ; that it had long felt their injuries
and and still continued to futferâyet under all
these circumllrnces, a d.fpofition has be<n
conllantly evinced, aid he b 1 eved was still
sincerely cheriflied by the kTeat mass of our
j*"' people, that recourse (hould not be had to
the last fatal refoit, till every rmde of ami
i, cable negociation had been attempted, and
evety rational hope of a peaceable adjuti
me nt of our complaints was exhauftcd.â
' Fn>m these impreflions, and at a period
uns' w 'l ,en our commerce wa* fuffering their un
-20. juftdepredations, we had sent coramiflioners
to the French nation, and was it proper un
til we were certainly advised that our com
missioners had left France, orthat every hope
of their effeSing the objeft of their mifliou,
'Â» was to be abandoned, to precipitate a mea- !
sure, the probable effect of w ,ich would be
to deftroyall pro/pedl of recantation even
if at the present momen{ Onr commiflioners
should be in treaty. Mr. B. said, that nei
ther the Difpatelies which we had received
from otirCo i miflionera, not any other m
'*Â» telligence from abroad, thathewas acquaint-
c ' ed with, compelled a bel ef that every pof
' libility of negociation was past } on the con
trary hand, it was perhaps ftriftly within
:r, the bounds of probability, that when the
Government of Fra ce difeovered an inflrx

The bill having been determined to be

answered,
Mr Gallatin hoped Monday would be
s the day He did not fee the neceffi y for paff
c ing the bill to day. But it wafaid, thehoufe

,1 tliis fnbjeift, because French privateers are
j within our Capes. To this he rep id, that
[. if there was any invjfion of our jurildidtion,
g and depredations committed within it, the
President of the United States had power to
â  t repel them without this law- He knew hÂ«
n had it, because the power is expressly give
f. to him in the law refpedting the Revenue
Cutters, and he knew the power had been
d used by him when a velTel aken by a priva
teer withi i our Jurifdi&inn lm-1 been Teilc

d Beftdes, he Understood the Senate were
ill I not in feflion to-day, and therefore, the bill
e . i if palf-d to day couid not go arvy fvoocr tr>
y the Senate than if it pafled oa Monday. If,
le therefore, it could not kaften the final paf
â H sage of the bill by going to the Senate to

a . could be given for so hally a proceeding.
] j He saw none He saw one reason for not paf
,a. fi.ig it. Ev_-ry ho ir might be expected to

,t. know , that a vessel was arrived from France,
a t which i 3 said to have brought accounts up tcr
an the Bth of April. Perhaps (he may bring
I information that would produce an unanimi
ty of op nioa as to the propriety of passing
a this b 11.
Mr. Craik rose to correctan aflfertion of
the yentleman from Pennfylvauia, that the
President had now all the power which was
necessary to proeft our property within the
I jurisdictional line. If he recolledVed rightly,
I ihe power given to the Prefiden in the law
I refpefting the Revenjie Cutters, was only
in( j i applicable to the Cutters ; butevenadmicting
| the Prelident had power the which thegentle-
I man mentioned, he wiflted to know whether
the President could employ it to as to giva
j effeftual proteftion to our commerce ? He
certainly could not employ it in the maner
direfted by this bill, which could alone be

Mr. J Parker saidÂ» as it cmi!d make no difference
wh< rher this bill palled today, or on Monday* he
fnould W in favor of Monday, at it is poitibl? the
veflei which bed been mentioned might bring fomc
advicea from our envoya, though ha ex petted noth
ing more favorable from that quarter than had been
already received. A* it waa said a French privateer
was wi hin our boundary, it was probable (he might
commit Tome depredation which might be heard of
before Monday, which would convince every one of
thenecffTity of patting this bill.
Mr. Otis saw no reason for delaying the Daftage of
this biii rill Monday, arising from the pofQbility of
the vessel which was said to be arrived from France,
having brought anv newi, because if information
fnould be received from our commiflioneri which
would give a different afpeÂ£t to our affairs, the Pre
fid en t of the United States could refrain from giving
these inftruclions. If this bill was patted to day, it
knight be reported to the senate on monday morning,
hot if it was podponed till Mondy, gentlemen might
come with frefo. motions and speeches, and produce
a farther delay.
Mr. Davis Imped the pafTage of thin hill would not
be in fitted upon to day. Thin fubjp& had but very
lately been referred to a fcle& committee, and they
had made an expeditious report Hehadjuft given
his vote in favor of the bill's pafling to a third :ead
Â»ng: bur, if contrary to the usage of the houie, he
should becailed upon to vote on the pafTage of the
Â£ill to day, he fhouid vote against it.
Mr. Bayard *as not willing to piftpone the third
reading of this bill to Monday, for the reason which
had been given, viz. becr>ufe the senate is not now fit
ting, -\fter'he bill had patted this house, its going
again to the senate was known to he a mere matterol
fern. Tnerefore, the moment the bill passes this
house, the Prrfident will be able to take meafuresim.
mediately as if the bil! had a&ually pafTrd through
all it* forms. But. until the bill had absolutely pass
ed this house, it would be impottible for the Prefi
dent to know to a certainty that lome members might
not, though they had hitheMo voted in favor oi the
bill (as they had heard one gentleman fay he intended
to do) when it cime to pals, vote againff it. Mr. B.
again (poke of the power of the Prelident as to the
protefiion of property within our own jurifdi&ion,
aod said that the French vessel which had been a Hurl
ed to might remain for any length of time within
our capes, provided it committed no hostility there,
without the Prtfideut's having the power to remove
her.
One word with refpe& to the probability of dif
patehes being received from our envoys before Mon.
day. The house had before been told of an arrival
here, ar.d referred to the coffee-noufe books, to prove
that our commifTioners were received. If the patting
of the bill was delayed till Monday, he the
house would be again told of an afr?va) at Boston,
Norfolk or fomc other part, and a asked
for, until we fhouid hear\vhether fomcthing might not
be heard to make this law unneceflary. If we
mean to aft at all, Mr. B said, the focHicr we begin
the better.
Mr, Varnum said, fineethe bill would become a
law as soon if pjfled on Monday, as to day, he could
not fee why the mot.on was obje&ed to. This guef
tion, Mr. V. said, was of the greatest importance, <
as it went to plunging the country into a war from
which it might r>ot be extricated tor many years to
come. Yet gentlemen aft as if they are afraid intel- (
ligence fhouid be received before this bill becomes a 2
jaw, which shall make it unneceflary. Indeed, it ap- \
peared to him, that there are Certain gentlemen in
the house who are determined to have a war with
France at anv rite. v
Mr. V. said it had been complained that mallufion v
had been made to the coffee-honfe bfM>ks of this citv
refpefting certain information hom Fra ice; he did
not ir.ink that was more out of order than what w.is a
btard one day-about French privateers having landed t
men on the coa't, another about being in our harbors S
and vefTels from tiience. All which fto- a
ries, he had no doubt were raised to influence the
of members of this house. The public would
doubtless f.*c them in this light. d
Mr. Sitgreaves said, as the gentleman last up ap- p
pea red to have some doubt as to the faft of a French 5]
privateer's being within the bay of Delaware, he
wculd read the information lately given by a captain c '
Canby, on Oath, at the office of the fccretary of Hate, g
[1 his certificate has appeared in all the papers; it a ,
fpea'*s of having seen a French privateer four miles
within the bay.] He would add, that with r
to the veflel arrived from Bourdeatix to day, (he ft
brings information that our commiflioners were yet o;
in Paris, but cot received by the dirt story. She left
Bourdeaux the Bth of April. So that the hope of re
ceiving any favorable news bv her could not be in.
dulged. Mr. S. crbferved, 'hat this bill was intended w
to meet a cafe of emergency, and it was proper, J
therefore, to get it paflVd as soon as pottible. If he i
saw it patted to day, he fhouid befure there could be '
no difficulty about it next week ; but if it was pod- et
poned till Monday, he fhouid be afraid of farther
time being spent udoii it The gentlemen from Ken
tucky (Mr. Davisy had alreadv said, it would no be Â»â¢
proper to pass this bill whilst our envoys are in Paris,
therefore, thoughh the question were postponed till 5
Monday, his vote could not be expefted. He, there- Â±
fore, law no reason for the delay
The queflion on the bill's being read a third time W
on Monday, was put and negatived 49 to 41. The r<
qucftion on reading it a third time to-day, was then rl
put and carried.
The bill was accordingly read the third time and

" al law for the relief of Insolvent Debtots, I
which, after fomc: obieflions from Mr. Coit, j â

Mr. Gallatin wished the committee 1 01
who made this report, would inform tfie I
House how many men would be wanted on I j]
board the several armed vefTels of the Unit- I ec
ed States.
Mr. J. Parker said the United States j
have three frigates, twelve ships and ten gal- j u
lies. The two 44. gun frigates will require | w
5 marines each ; one of 36 guns will need Ij n
48 men ; two vefTels of 22 guns each, will I fe
want 25 each ; two vefTels of 20 tuns will I
require the fame number; eight vefTels of P!
.16 guns each, will need 20 men each; and j
ten gallies each lomen. making in the v. hole
518, exclusive of sergeants and music. There I "
will be no additional expence attending the j te
change, except the pay of a Major, and|it w
would be much more convenient to be thus I m
organized, than to remain as at present. Jf"
Mr. Varnum wished to know whether \jit
these mÂ«n would ever be together Â£b as to lor
enable the Commanding Officer of a Bat'al I ' 3 ''
lion to difciplise the corps. He believed l r '
they would be â  separate in the different vcf- f Q C
fels, and that there wou dbe no means of gr
bringing them together for the purpose. Be- f <
fider, those Marines who have engaged in I w<
the service, have engaged to serve on board I
ship, and not on landâso that this law would I
have a retrofpeftiveeffca on those men, now I rci
to fay vJiey fhouid bath serve on sea and I int
land. I foi
Mr. Sewall could not fay that these K ec
Marines could be brou.>ht together to be I
disciplined ; but the Major would fuperin I fro
tend the whole, hear complaints, and attend I
to the recruiting service. He would also I
have to attend to the fortifications, and fake I a *
a great deal of trouble from the War Office j
The men would also sometimes be on shore. I f c f (
and without some officer is appointed, they 11 0
would be foltly under the care of the Lieu- fee
:enant. He believed upon th- whole much hÂ«
advantage and economy would be derived I ;Jr
from it. I
The question being put upon the report,
it was agrsed to, 54 votes being for it. bo<
The committee then rof:, ntl t e Honfr I ere
agreed to the report, after a few obfervati. [ pei
088 from Mr. Gallatin, hoping that when Ar
the bill was brought in, this corps of Ma- n,a
rines would not be made a permanent p.irt of att
the Military ellablifhment, but onlv have the fro
fame duration with the laws for equipping ng
and keeping in employment the armed vcf for

CONGRESS.
On Monday the House of Representatives of the
he United States on motion of Mr. Allcn, postponed
ro- the consideration of the bill for the prevention and
of restraint of dangerous and seditious persons, and
r went into a committee of the whole oathe bill f r Â°m
the Senate,"entitled " An ad concerning Aliens,"
but soon after Mr. Gallatin had commenced his
ay o( (VrTotions against the fir feiftion of the bill, he
an was interrapted by th? receipt of the MelTage from
:r . the President of the United St'atesj which appeared
in our paper of 'l'uefday.
After the reading of the dispatches was fir.ifhed,
)m a motion was made to print 1200 copies of them
d, [or the use ol the members.
ve Mr. T haTcbik hoped at lead Jooo copies
X- would be printed. It was well known that the let
ter of iV*lr. TaHeyrand had already been printed in
the French paper of this city, and he believed by or
as der of the Executive Directory. And he under
(food that printer had printed an additional number
re- of that letter for thefupply of persons who are not
h s regular readers. When he saw, therefore, the
j(-_ Executive Direftory, and its agents, taking extra
, ordinary means to spread that letter, he wished Â»o
e take equal means to publish the answer of our Com
-0 millions to it, which he thought not only fitisfac
le tory, but incontrovertible. He lhould think him
r felf deficient in duty, if he were to oir.it the oppor
tunity of moving for an additional quantity of this
reply to lie printed.
L 1 Mr. T. Claiborne did not nnderftand what
0 the gsntloman meant in faying he believed certain
persons are French agents.
n Mr TMatcher said, he omfidered the printer of I
t the paper to which he had alluded as an agent of <
the ('tench Dirc&ory, and he hoped !â¢ on to lay be- '
fore th# house fatisfaiftory evidence of the fait. ;
Mr. Harper wilbed not only i,ooo,hut amuch (
i- larger number of this dispatch might be printed, i
d He hoped 5,000 at lead. Che truth of the positions (
e mentioned by the gentleman from MafLchufetts t
was top evident, to be for a moment doubted. It c
' had long been manifeft to him that France had her
d secret agents in this country, and that every means
had been made nfe of to extlte refiflaflte ta.the aiqs- (
e" Aire? ot' our government , and tp .â¢ aife a fpiiit of fao ,
ticm inÂ»He country favourable to the views of France, ,
s and the ail of Saturday was only one of the ramifi
cations of the scheme. A fait, Mr. H. said, had (
Y taken place within these few days, which he ap- (
1 prehelided *irould lead to the discovery of a trea
e fonable correspondence carried on by persons in this j.
country with France, of the most criminal nature.
He was, therefore, defirnus of counteraSing the ef- J
feiSiof any of their machinations, by publiihing the
truth tn the people ; and he promised the house he
s would do all in his power to bring this matter to
; light
Mr. Harrison was in favour of JOOO, as he
wilhed the people of the United States to receive
1 the fulled information on this and every other fub
-1 je<st. With refpefi to French age. its being in this
count y, he cared but little about them. He did
not fear any thing they can do. S
Mr. Davis hoped tie gentleman from S. Caro- w
lina would give such information to the houlie, as o
would enable them ta detedl any plan that was on c.
foot injurious to the iptereds of the country. If he |>
would do so, it (hould have his hearty support. P
Mr. Harper pledged hinifclf to the gentleman di
from Kentucky and to the House, not tote remiss tc
in probing the business he had fpoVen of. He had tr
got hold of some of the threads of it, and he hoped
soon to be able to developethe whole of the mis- ej
chievous proceeding. If (o, he (hould not fail to pi
bring it before the public, .nnd rely upon the alEd- [ii
ance of that gentleman and the house generally, to r ,
bring the authors, and those concerned in it, to con- (;
dign punishment.
On fuggedion of Mr. Sitgreaves, that i* would ! J*:
be well to direct the Secretary of State tÂ« have a j
large number of all the dispatches received from W
our Cemmifiioners printed and didributed, the mo- f C
tion tor printing them leparately was withdrawn,
and Mr. S. afterwards laid a propufrion directing
the Secretary of State to get printed and distribut
ed copies of the whola of he dispatches. T ( ]
Yesterday, the House of Representatives of the
United States, again went into a committee of the t0
whole on the bill from the Senate concerning Ali
ens*. On motion of Mr. Otis, a new feflion was â  so '
introduced declaring it to be lawful for any alien ! wi
sent out of the country to take with him such part ! co
of his property as may be convenient, and that any ou
property left behind him (hall be as much fubjedt to di<
his order as if he remained in the country. On no
tion of Mr. Harper, the Mowing words at the
condufion of the second feaion, were druck out,
" and continued to bard labour for and." The commit
tee rose and reported the bill with the amendments, T<
which having been agreed to, Mr. R. Williams
moved to dnke out the Words " during Ifat the
end of the second l'eaion, and to insert in their place, Tt
" so long a, in the opinion oftbc PriJJ.nt the public fafal
Jball require it," which was agreed to. Ihe bill was 1
ordered to be read a third time to-morrow. The
bill authorizing the defence of merchants vessels

Senate with amendniejts, which were committed
for to- orrow, and ordered to be printed. The bill am
granting the Secretary of the Navy th 4 privilege of wh

Yesterday arrived he'e, the brig Sally,
Capt. Havens, from Morlaix, in France.
From thÂ® paffengrrs, &c we learn ;
That it was reported at Morlaix ; that
the French ambaffad >r to th emperor of
Germany, had left Vienna, in consequence
of some ill usage he had received from the
people ; and that the emperor had written
to the Dire&ory on the fubjeÂ£l :
I That the invasion of England was still
the stalking horse; but it was the opinion
of many, that it would never be tt,em,pted ;
and that the assembly of .the troops oh the
occasion, is merely to have them at hand in
cafe the Dire&ory (h"uld choose tu co jure
up another conspiracy :
'ihat a S{sa-i(h frigate had obtained the
leave of admiral Parker to proceed from
Cadiz to England, on what errand is un
known : And,
That a French 74 gun (hip, coming
round from POrient to Brest, had been cap
tured by the Erglifh.
The spirit of itnio% and purtf princip'es
of patriotism exhibited y. Ilerday in 'he pro- \

FRENCH FRATERNITY.
Capt. Ebc ezer Ward arrived here on
Tuesday from Turks Island. On his out

by a French privateer, which put on
board him the crew of the brig Elizabeth
Wm, Fiiller'on, matter, of Philadelphia;
which brig (be had t iken on herpaffag'* from
Teneriffe home. This crew informed capt.
W. that the fame privateer had catptured
the brig Patty, Capt. George Ropes, of
this port, who had a few days b fore, with
the assistance ef two boys, recovered her
from another SS an g of French villains, as has
been recently mentioned. On finding out,
â by threatening the life o 1 one of ihe boys,
that capt. Ropes had retaken his v.-flel, th y
'treated him in an it famous and abusive mat -
ner, and charged him of having murdered
those who had p-ifTeflÃon of her. But the
contrary is known, as the pe pic have ar
rived fafe at St. Thomas's, in a boat which
capt. R. humanely gavfc them 'â  he Patty
is now sent into Porto Rico. Her cargo is
.provisions; and 110 English goodsâWe are
the more for-y for Capt Ropes's fa;e, as he
has tftablifhed thefaft, that one American

Ba~he fays he never has and never will
wittingly deceiv the puhlic.
t J i' 1 ? if , he has not PuMi'ftied a vile
falfehood when he charges our government
with keeping. back the latl dispatches from
our Envoys, and whether he hfc not tvit
tmjgh; deceived W.' waderj, by
pubhlhing the fame frtlfehood, and keep.W
h,s poor dupes in the dark by withholding
a ltate of facts r rom theiV view?
It is to b? rememhered very few per
sons who take the Aurora, ever fee any o
ther paper.
If Bache did juffice to his subscribers,
one halt of his paper would be 3 ccntra
, didbon to the otherâor, the columns of
to day would coiifefs the lies and misrepre
sentations of yesterday.
It has been demonstrated that he pub
lifhtrd a moll villainous falfhood rrfpeaing
1 the time of the recepiion of Talleyrand's
letter bv the Executive. He has however
carefully kept out of his paper the refuta
: tinn ; inflead of this he has thrice repeated
the caluipny.
Bache fays the frigods of the Gove nment
of the (Tnited States want nerve. He
doubtless had in his " mind'* eye" the myr
midons of the despots of France The
FiOi Women of Parisâthe Bn'chers of
Robespierre.. He wants every thing that
diftingatfhes sien from devils, who an tic i
pateswith pleasure the scenes w'ich would
desolate the Globe should the French fuc
cecd in adcfcent on England; ' '
i It is evident from the Statement puhlifh
ed by the Editor of the Aurora, that he
has a C rrefpondent in the Office of Foreign
Affairs at Paris. It is undoubtedly fad a'-
so, that the corr. fpondence relays to public
affairs, as it apprars the pack ts dir.fted to
tha- Editor, are sealed with the seal
OF OFF.CE.
Nothing is more evident than this, that
the union of the fever tl states, and the
! rallying of the people round the confli
tuted authorities, has inflifted a mortal
wound on the ho es of the infrrnal fafti n
who have brought this conntry to the verge
of a foreign war, and only regret that
there is so faint a profped of civil commo
tions at the fame time.

" We have parted ten days of disorder, of
agony, and contusion. The id of March in the
morning, news was received of the attack ot
the French upon Soleure : It might be said to
cause more joy than consternation, while we
were animated with ardor to repel a foreign in
vttfion : Nothing but anxiety for the cornnat ap
penred : but in the aftet-n on, Â»tÂ» the news ol
the redudlion of Soleure and Fribourg-, that firft
effervefcence abated. There was entered into,
a new negoeiation, which came to nothing,and
served only to waste precious time, to (ow dii
truft, and to reverse the arrangements which the
firft orders hid eftabliflied. In the firft comiiat,
on the 3d of March, before A rbcrg, the tro.ops
of Berne and those of Zurich hid it firft fepolf
ed the French: but this success was of veryfeort
duration : harmony no longer exilted : whilll
some of the officers wiftied to adl offenfivelyy
others gave orders to their men to hold them
selves limply on the defenfive. These different
and contradictory ordeu of the officers inspired
inte the soldiers suspicions of treachery, and
cruelly exasperated them against their officers.
On the 4th at 6 o'closk in the morning, the old
government abdicated: the provisory govern
ment was appointed and eftabliflied. During
the day, a great number of troops entered the
city: the soldiers breathed nothing but vengeance
against those wh m they called traitors: they
wilhed to be led against the French : they com
plained loudiv of "the council of two hundred, :
which had fo'fuddenly checked .their aclmty,
and of those of their officers who had appeared
to them to be partakers of their conduit.
' i i At ? lfes Â°.f city, Rybi-ier,

y their men. Many others (hired presently the
fame fate. AcLording to popular report, the
general D Erlach was also miierably inaffacred
by his troops ; and bis chateau threatened with
conflagration. In fine, in the afternoon, the
proDifory government was enabled to get fomc
. control ovf this popular movement, ar.d todif
tra(H its effeifts, by fending a p.irt of the troopj
to the bridge oF Gummenen, and panther to
