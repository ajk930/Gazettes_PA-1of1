June 29,
Their Lordftiips met at a Very e?rly hr.ur.
and proceeded to pass the few bihs w 1 ic
were before th m. Between thjee and foui
o'clock his. Majelly came into the House

of state, and having taken his feat the
Commons were Ln for, and havi ig attend
ed accordingly, the Speaker, oh pr fenti's,

a ipeecli, ait Hows:
Â«â¢ Mo/l Gracious Sovereign,
Your faithful Cemmo s humbly attend
yotir Majelly wiih the bills which dole the
ftipply for the public service of the year.
" In providing tor the effectual profecu
tton of the contell In which the country is
engaged*, your Commons have been a&u
ated by the conviction that 110 alternative
remained; and that it was only from the ex
traordinaiy efforts which the ci'ifis demand
ed, that the means cou'.d be derived of
maintaining the honour of your Maj> lly's
Crown, arid the security a d independence
tof the Bntilh Empire. Considerations of
temporary co. verience have accordingly
given way to the ur. etil duty of combining
the attention, so peculiarly important at
th : s time, to the sup;;. rc and liability of
public crtdit, â  ith a determination to m ke
ftr. pr vision for the fevtral bia. ches
of the public r rvice. To these objefts tkc
delib. nations of yoUr Commons have beei
diligently applied; and thev have observed.
with prti - a-d fa'i fafliori, that the unex
ampled Verifiers, which the (late (f the
public affairs appeared to ihem iiidifpeiilibly
to require, have been accompanied with
juch demonstrations of loyalijr and zeal from
11 c'aflfcs of your fubjeits, by voluntary ex
ertions of every delci iption, to fu.ch an ,a
mount and extent as to afford the best ce;m
nient oa the hopes and the mod decifivr a
{wer o the misrepresentations upon which
the enemv founded the vain and prefum; tu..
ous projeft of detlro>ing the commercial
prosperity, the maritime greatnvfs, aud li
btrties of these kingd -ms.
" Your Commons, Sire, are' gr tified by
the persuasion that th ir proce p have
been, in all refpcÂ£l , flrirtly conformable to
the inter ft and the fentiftients of a free and
Intel igent people, who co'.fider no efforts
too gieat which may be
the designS, and epe the attempts of the
enemy; and to pfef.rve that co ftitution
which they know to be the guardian of a!l
that is moll dear aid valuable to themselves,
and the best inheritance that cau'be trans
mitted to their defcenda ts.
" Vhe bills which I have in nly hand are
feveralfy entituled, &c. &c.''
His Majelfy then delivered the following
moft-graciotss speech. t
" My Lor s and Grtitleriten,
"By the measures adapted during the
prefenr Session, you have amply fulfilled the

e ijtlvMeliidor, July i.
s The Council received a meflage from the
e Directory, which was read by the Secreary.
1 ' For a long time, fay the Directory, the
I Government of Malta has (hewn itl'elfholtile
io France. It afforded proteition to emi
grants, as also to the soldiers of Conde's ar
e my. Ht-r constitution ought to have obliged
y her to Ã¼bicrve a Itrict neutrality, but (he al
-1 .vays aited in lavor of the enemies of France,
n The French,, who V* ere friends to liberty ai
Vlalta, were ill treated and confined. In
a manifefto of the ittth of October, 1793,
the Grand Matter declared that the porta
of the Island should be (luit againlt French
velfels, and that he (houldrecogivze the Am
b batlador but as a Charge d'Affaires of the
King, without faying any thing of the Repub
,l lie ; lie declared he could not, nor would not
recognize it. On the 9th of June, of the
pre lei it year, a requefi; was made by the
French General for water, which was ref-fed
P by the Grand Mailer, who declared ironical
e ly, that he could not admit but two (hips in
-0 to the port. Dared he thus to insult the
j French army, commanded by Buonaparte,
s fay the Direcfoiy I The toth of June, the
French were on Uiore early in the morning,
and Malta was inverted, and the tow n can
nonaded on al tides. The betieged made a
1 (ally, in which General Marmont, at the head
1 of the 19th brigade, toedc the ftai\dard of the
i, order. On the 1 ith, the Knights iurrender
ed the tow n and the fort, and renounced their
property in the Klaiitl to the French Repub
lic.
e The Directory adds, we found at Malta
two yelMs, one frigate, four gailies, 1200
I pieces of cannon,4o,ooo mtiikets.i, joo.ooolb
powder, and other ammunition, of which the
Direc'tjury had not received the particular de

1. He is said to be on his way to India., j
For this purpose he must land at A lexaodria, 1
pass his army over about ,100 miles of sandy
defart, under the burning rays of a tropical
Am, almost vert cal there at this season.
Arrived at Saez, he must find tranf orts
I ready -to convey his a my to the coast of
! Malabar, tinrppofed or un vanquished by our !
' fleet in India. Th'fe difEculti Â« to us would
j seem itifurmountable, did we not know the
' enterprising spirit and hitherto refiftlefr, p-nv- |
er of the modern H;Vonibal. Once landed 1
on the Coast of Jrlala >. r, he will be received â 
1 with open amis byTipp j S )ib,who breathes â¢
rev ng- for his late humiliation. We re
c dieÂ© the fyltem of colonizing Egypt,
Which waÂ» mentioned in *ls French legi'l.i
tur . We rccb'led the proclamation of the
â¢ governor of the M..uricius. And we recoU
ie ' that a French direilor declared that
Britain was to be attacked in the most vul-
I nerable part. 111 opposition to this mult be
; set the improb hilttv that Buor.aparte wculd
rifi< a diminuti n of bis fame by so hazar
i dous au expediti' n. Yet we b.lieve tkat

feflion of some of the prin - ipal itlands in the
Mediterranean, Candia, Cyprus, Maltaâ
perhaps Sicily. The sovereigns 6f ihofj
islands are uot, it is true, at war wjth
France ; but we remember the fable of the
wolf and the lamb ; facile ejl opptimerc in
nocentem.
To effeiSl a levolution, and to re establish
a republic in Greese, has been mentioned as
the design of the expedition. To the eye
, of philofophyj or of general policy, 1 change
in the Turkish government appears desira
ble. And a close coritfpondenct has taken
place between the French and the Greeks
through the illand of Corfu, which the for
mer have feiztd. This indeed will not be
ftri6ily confident with the news which in
duced the late emprtfs Catharine to call a
young Ruffian prince Conftantine..
1 4 There are many, who affirm that
1 Bucy aparte is to penetrate through the
Turkish dominions into Poland, in order to
: rtftote the Poles to their former indepen-
I d-'nee, and to the rank which they once
; obtained in the lift of Dations. The French
Â® Â£ren#ral told bia '.army that they to<sk tio
horses becanfe they would be well mtfu-'ted
as soon as they reached the place of their
f destination. It will naturally be asked,
' whether France is wil ing to attack in Po
-1 land the united p wer of Austria, Rufiia,
aud Prussia ? Perhaps file is sensible of the
; irimical fentirpents of these p.owers, and will
not wait till thty ft ike the firft blow,
f 5. Nor are those wantirg, who think it
" probab.e that the French army will invade
: the Crimea, and the southern parts of Ruf-
fia, difpoflefs her of Oczakow, and strength
' en the Turkish frontier againlt that empire.

that prevail refpe&ing this mysterious ar

their own c. nclufions.

HEALTH-OFFICE,
September j, 1798.
Fellow-Citizens,
Impelled by the awful progress and un
paralleled malignity of the prevailing fever,
\v/c are constrained ,to address.your feelings,
as well 33 yÂ»ur rea()n, in ofder to avert the
fatal deftruttion which, with rapid (hides,
is pervading our ill r ated city and fuburhs.
The belt jkill ofour phyfjeians, and all
the power 9 of n.&dcme, it m.ift be acknow
ledged, hive pro* c unequal in the contest
with this divauringpoifyn.
With the moll ffcCiing fympat! y and
anxious folicittide, we h u ve to the btft of
our judg-i\icn;s, erÂ«*Bvoured to employ, as
eircumftariees appeared to require, the pow
er and the means ehtrufted to us, in arreft
i g its pre grefs, a>t alkvi tinÂ£ its concomi
tant miseries. We (hall continue to em
ploy them with urffmitting zeal; but wr
have neither the jower not the mean to
accomplish all the measures necrffary
to check its exteu/ion, or provide for the
pressing exigences of the moment. The
powers del gated, and appropriations made
by law. to the intitutions under our direc
tion, are impotelil indeed, when compared
to the magnitude >f the occalion.
It remains for Â«ur fellow citizens to at
tain, by their enerjy, the etoda which alone
can (Vrp its progrefc and diminish its honors.
We have, in cotjtindlion with the Guar
dians of the Poor, caused tents to be ereft
ed on the east baik of the Schuylkill, for
the accommodation of the. indigent ; where
near twelve h.mdred are already provided
for, out of the fund appropriated si r tlio or
dinary relief of (he poor. This is but a
partial of the evils which
environ thriifanids who have a claim upon
the philanthropy of those who are iÂ«# more
fortunate circnmftances.
I'he difficulty of prep ring a place of. re
fuse, at prefent,in thecoun'ry, is too well
known ; nnd the expence attending the re
moval of a family has discouraged many
fron the attempt, who are in circumstances
to live comfortably at home.
What remains to be done ? Citizens of
refpeflability aud influence ! Come forwa<d,
and form yourfelvts into a committee for
the purpose of ere&ing on the weft bank
of the Schuylkill, ail tie tents that cau be
collected; let the tents be floored with
boards, 'and made as comfortable as pollible
if tents cannot be had, boards in abnn lance
may be procured for the ereftion of fhed<.
Admonilh those citizens who have no place
of refuge, to take (helter theie, particulatlr
those from the. east part of the" city, the dif
triilof Southwark, andthe Northern Liber
ties^âin short, ALL who can leave their
homes without manifeft injuty ; except
those who are nece/Tary for the proteÂ£lion
of the city at)d liberties.
The committie fhculd iave the general
fuperistendarce and regulation of the tent's,
and authority to preserve order ; contrast
for certain "ffeead. meat, vegeta
bles, wqo3, &c. at the lowe f puffihle rates.
Those who are not in circumstances to pay,
must be fuppHed by public bounty.
It is at best an unequal, p rhaps an unjnft
moÂ«3e of railing money by an appeal to the
humanity of generous indiviJuals ; but ifon'
any occasion it may be juftified, the present
mr.y be assumed without helitatiog.
We call yoCtr attention to the aiSual and
undifa;viifed state of our city. Corfider the
mortality and rapid increase of the sick at so
early a period. View the lift of your pby
ficians, and marl how few are at their pojlt ;
ard, we believe yiu will think with us, that
the 'prefcrvatiun of health it only to be at
tuicjfcil by fligiit.
Do rot flatter yourfelveo, fellow-c itiiens
that this pifture is too highly coloured , w,
speak From conviftion, and a knowledge e â 
faits ; and doubt not.'ut t ; iat the lives o;
hundreds} perhaps of thousands, may be pre.
served by the adoption of these or similar
measures.
