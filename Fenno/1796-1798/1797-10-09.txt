The daring mutiny on board the S/.
George man of war of 98 guns,Capt. Peaiftl,
one of Lord St. Vincents fleet, was lutily
quelled by the .spirit and activity of net,
Commander and First Lfentenant. Three
men, who had been sentenced to fuffer death
For mutinous behaviour in fonie other (hip,
were sent on board the St. George to be
executed; the crew,on the arrival of thepri
foners, drew up a remonftahce in their fa- j
vour, and begged of Captain Pcard to inter
cede in their behalf with the Admiral of
the fleet. The Captain replied, that he
flionld lay their prayer before Lord St. Vin
cent ; and in pursuance to his promise, hfcloft
no time in submitting the remonflranw to
him.âThe tioble Earl's answer was, that
he confidercd the sentence of the mutineers
as founded upon folidjuft ice and imperious
necessity, and consequently he could not
think of retracting the fan&ton which he
had given to the judgment of the Covrt
Martial by wh/>m they had been convi&ed.
Upon this determination being made known
to the people of the St. George, the stron
gest symptoms of difaffe&ion were manifeft
ed by them. Obfcrving their conduft, the
Captain took the precaution of watching
their proceedings with the utmost ftriftnefs }
and very soon discovered, by means of an
honest tar, that they had entered into a re
solution of seizing the (hip, deposing the
officers, and liberating their condemned
companions. The evening previous to the
day oppointed for carrying into efFeft the
sentence of the Court Martial was the time
fixed upon to put their plan in force.
Captain Peard, feeing the crew aflemble
in the wnfte, immediately approached, and
addrefTed them to the following effeft:
Â«Â« I am perfectly aware of your intentions,
and (hall oppose them at the riik of my
life. YÂ«u have determined to rtfift the
authority of your officers : I am refofved
to do my duty, and to enforce a striA obe
dience to my orders. I am sensible that
you are for the most part the viftims of de
lulion : I know the ringleaders, and do not
hesitate to avow my intentions of bringing
them to justice. I command you to dif
_perfe and return to your duty." Finding
this address did not produce the def.red ef
fect, the eaptaia instantly rulhed in amidst
the crowd, accompanied only by his firft
lieutenant', bravely seized two of the peo
ple, whom he knew to be the promoters
of the conspiracy, dragged them out by
main force and put them in irons, without
experiencing the slightest resistance from
the crew ; and such wdÂ» the gallant spirit
and determined courage displayed by him
on the occnfton, that order was immediately
reftcred by the remainder of the men retir
ing to their refpeftive stations. The three
convi&s were next morning hanged at the
yard-arm, agreeably to their sentence, in
the presence of the repentant crew, whose
conduct from that time was marked with a
becoming fubmifiion and subordination.
When our accounts came away, the two
mutinous seamen remained in custody, and
the necessary arrangements were forming to
bring them to a speedy trial. The 'firft lieu
tenant has iince been promoted to the rank
of matter and commander, as a just tribute
to his acknowledged merit.^

" But the description of men by far the
most obnoxious to this contagion, who
fuffered most from it, were those lately arri
j ved from Europe, and especially those who
had never before been in a hot climate. In
: general those of tea ft fibres and fanguinous
j temperament, were the most readily infected,
! and to these the disease was most fatal.
" An officer of the 45th regiment visited
! the Hankey, and, with two or three soldiers
who rowed his boat, remained on board
some time. The consequence of this im
prudence was fatal to himfelf; and, in a lit
tle time, to many of the men Â» all the offi
cers and men were fucceflively fei'zed with
the disease ; but it proved fatal only to .the
new recruits. Of this regiment, confiding
of 280 men, 24 died.
" About the beginning of May the dis
ease made its appearance in a detachment of
artillery, introduced by some of the gunner*
who had had communication with the 45th
regiment.
" Of 84 men, who had been on the island
about 3 years, 56 were attacked with the
fever before the Ift of July, and of thefa
only 5 died. Of 27 recruits 26 were tnfeft
ed, and 21 of these 26 died before the mid
dle of August : a dreadful instance of its
peculiar tendency to prove fatal to those not
not accustomed to a hot climate.
" About the firft of June the fever began
to appear among the Negroes on the estates
in the neighborhood of the town. In the
course of the month only about one in four
wasinfefled, and only about tine in 83 died
of it.
" In the course of the months of May,
June and July, the fever appeared iu several
distinct and distant parts of the island, whither
the contagion was carried by persons who
had imprudently visited infefted houses in
town.
" But the contagion was not confined to
Grenada alone from this, as a focus, it
spread to the other i/lands. to Jamaica, St.
Domingo, and also to Philadelphia, by
means of vessels, on board of which the in
feftion was retained by the clothes, more
especially the woolen jackets of the dcceafed
failorj.
" I have been thus particular in stating
the progress of this malignant peftik-ntial
fever, chiefly with a view to demonstrate
- 1 ft. That it was uncommonly infe&ious.
" 2d. That it arose from hitman contagion,
heightened by various causes to a pestilential
degree of violence.
" And 3d. That liktf the plague, it has
been communicated, in every instance, either
by aftual contafk with an infefted person ;
or by breathing air charged with effluvia
proceeding frm the infefted ; or by touching
"the cloathes of or sleeping in a place where
an infeÂ£led person has been.
" Neither age nor sex were exempt from
the infedlion.
" It had been urged by some, that the
disease arose from tlje flsate of the atmof-j
phere, and that human tontagion could not
give rife to it, as it wes so prevalent in dis
tant and dillinft places at the fame time.â
The foregoing narrative fliews that this opi
nion was without foundation : -"but had there
been no other proofs of its contagious na
ture, the (late of the weather alone during
the months of February, March, April,
May, June, July and August (the latter
end of which the disease difappearcd in Gre
neda) would" he fufficignt for this ptirpofe.
" The weather,though previous to the ap
pesrfnee of this disease, much more wet and
boifterona than usual at that season of the
ytar, war, after it broke, mild'; and wonlji.,

infeftion if it had been of a natiu-e to ]?e af

much greater. As the change so moisture
was remarkably firdifen and great, much ex
pectation was formed, that the virulence of
the infeftibn woutd~be done away, or con
siderably abated ; but as neither happened,
the strongest pollible iftjgutnent was afforded
againjfc-the agency of the weather in the
produdtion-oftlie difeafc.
In Jurit the thermometer fell more than
orice at noori to 77, and rose but once as
high as 81. All July was rainy with east
erly winds and frequent thunder. In Au
guil less rain fell ; but the atmosphere was
generally close arid sultryâwind variable,

PICTURE OF FRANCE
BY A FREN'CHMAN.
(From a Paris theQuotidienne.)
" France wiihes rbr peac^ âtrance wiffi
, es to fee an end to the revolution :âboth
are necessary for her. These are 'the pre
dominant traits in'her, pifture ; for, who
knowsher wcllsnough to paint her as she is ?
How Ihoulda foreigner know France, when
France does not know herfelf ? Befides,'how
is any body to know a country, in'which all
the political, religions, moral and civil insti
tutions, have been annihilated, most of the
monuments deftrayed, private fortunes ruin
ed, and in which even the inhabitants them*
selves are no longer, cognizable, except by
their frivolity and their courage ; a coun
try in fhoTt, in which every thing is new,
and which no observer has yet travelled o
ver ; a country, moreover, whose furface is
so changeable, in such constant motion, that
it presents no fixed objeft to the eye, hut
I misery ; and that a pifture which would be
striking to-day, would cease to be a likencfs
to-morrow ? yet every man pretends that he
fees very clearly what France is, beeaufe
each individual views it through the prism
, of his passions ; and the pifture always
i seems to be like to every man, who recog
' niics his own features in it.
" The infplence of upstarts, the profliga
cy of both sexes, the credit of prostitutes,
i their gold and their diamonds contrasted
with the rage of the wretched creditors of
the state j the despair and felf-deftruftion of
a croud of unfortunat# beings, reduced to
the most dreadful djftrefs ; the manoeuvres
and insatiate cupidity of stock-jobbers, and
monopolizers ; all the dreadful consequences
of an unbridled pafllon for gaming ; the
government without means ; their eijhsuft
ed treasury, and their irupotenee to rcftrain
the most horrid disorders ; intrigue and
money njt or|ly disposing of all places, but
eveti direfting the fentence# of courts of jus
tice { .parties diftinguiflied, one by its rage,
a ftcond by its apathy, a third by its ma
chiavclifm ; wickcdnefs anticipating puber
ty ; audacious crime assuming the malk
of timid mvdefty : In Ihort, aflaffination,
, plunder of every kind, the most atrocious
manners, and not afingle effort, not a lingle
dyke to restrain this- inundation ps
Such is the pifture of France ?
" The Frenchman who cherilhes his
country, wiflies to rejeft the fears of a doubt
ful futui-ity"; but hbw can he rejeft them,
when his car is i nee (Tandy affailea with the
most affliftive recital* ; when the history of
each day presents new excesses or new mif
fortunes ; when there no longer exirfs either
a restraint upon debauchery, education for
youth, or! relief for indigence ; when eftab-
Jifliraents of every kind, the happy fruits of
civilization, remain in a state of demolition,
withput a single attempt to rebuild them ;
wheh Paris, careless about the events of the
war, is only inteTefted in the adventures of
an aft re fs, or in the fides of some fuccefsful
fpcculator, who has suddenly quitted his
Ihop for a palace ; when the direftory daily
delivers a most alarming account of the finan
ces ; and when, with upwards of twenty
thousand laws, with numerous armies, and
â fltith a power unlimited, they are unable to
discharge the firft duty of a government, by
iiifuring the fafety 6f individuals."
[A pifture drawn in a more masterly man
ner than the above, I do not recolledt to have
seen. It is elegant perspicuous, strong,
r.nd true j qualities that rarely meet in a lit
erary description.
Such is the pifture of France. Such is
the Hate, into which the vaunted revolution
has plunged that once, flgutiihing, and hap
py country. Such !s the horrid republic, <
for which the filly' people of France have
been led, step by step, to truck thejr an-i
cient monarchy, giving their wealth, their
religion, their national honor. an<j millions!
of lives to boat! and yet, fcandalqiis to re
late, this abominable exchange is,a theme
of congratulation with many persons fn A
merica ; and, what is something perfeftly
preposterous, these people pretend at the

DESPOTISM OUT-DONE.
Jarcdlrvin, who, for our fins and to com
plete the degradation of onr 'state, is the
present Governor of Georgia, has of late
done what ancient tyranny with the power
ful aids of fuperftitiorj did never attempt,
nor modern anarchists ever dared to avow ;
he, solely veiled with the executive powers
of this government, has totally annihilated
a law palled for the express purpose of remo
ving his own imaginary obstacles, doing a
way every refponiibility on bis part, and ren
dering his line of proceeding easy for folly
itfelf to ail tipon a law too enacted by
the very faftion which treated him ; and a
faftion it mnft be, whatever is its* ntÂ»mljef, |
as it is composed of men who tjfory in being j
considered etierr,! ' our govern- I
ment and authors oi such a remonstrance to |
Congress as would disgrace even the B.ita

Last week arrived at Plymouth in this
Tlate, captain Levin Bofman, in a schooner
belonging to MelTr3. Stewart and Armftead,
of that place. Captain Bofman was captured
on his homeward bound passage by a French
privateer, who took all the hands out of the,
fehoo,nÂ«r,except the captain, mate and super-
cargo, awd put five of qur dear sansculotte
allies on boÂ£.rd. Having no French colours,
they transformed tbe American into French,
and with the fragments decorated the unfor
tunate p4ptain, round whom ' they danced
the Carmagnole, by way of condolence
They then seized a. hog on boaVd, which
they called King Qeorge, and after cutting
off his head, apin danced the Carmagnole
and played other republican gambols, ala
mode de Paris. Tbe sagacious and intrepid
captain did not let these manoeuvres pass un*
observedâbut takingÂ»a good opportunity,
seized the fellow at the helm, whom he foou
fecurcd, and gaining poffeflloij. of rite arm

only at a small distance, they therefore pro

altered their course, committed our dear al

To the Electors of Philjdelphi/I.
Having feen*S ticket, proposed to be run
at the ensuing Eleftion, by which the Sena
tor and all the Members of the AfTeuibly art
to be changed. I beg leave to afl< any con
siderate person if this is a wife, or prudent
rneafureâadmittirig the proposed candidates
were equally well qualified in point of abil
ities for public business, they certainly are
in a great rneafure unacquainted with the
mode of conducing it, therefore so thorough
a change mufl be a great difadvant3ge if
it was the wish of the citizens to make an
entire change, surely fomeperfons would be
placed on the ticket that had heretofore had
fonae experience of the mode or manner of
proceeding in the Legislature ; I would not
be thought to inflnuate any thing against
the chara&ers of whofe names
have been held out to the public, and some
of them I should certainly not objeft to at a
proper time 5 but let me ask are they supe
rior to those who .served us last year.
Mr. Benj. R. Morgan has served in the
senate the sessions which began in December
last and the short one of two days in August;
during this time the liberality of his senti
ments, the candour he has always shewn and
the soundness of his judgment, has very
deferyedly procured the refpeft and confi
dence of I believe every member of that bo
dyâhe was the only person of pr sessional
legal knowledge in the senate, and no other
person of that description is expefted to be
eleÂ£led this year in any of the other diftri&s ;
I therefore think, that without detrailipg â
from the merits of the person jropofed in
opposition to him, or arly other who might
be proposed, considering all circumflances,
he is the best choice we can make.
One cirCumstance I hope it will not be
deemed improper to mentionâWill it be
right to make so great a change in the ab
sence of so great a proportion of our fellow;
eleAprs ? The difference in the number of
deaths in '93, and at this time, may, in
some rneafure, be attributed to the early i
- j removals, which broke the chain by which
i infe&ioa was through the city,
<->ur absent fellow-citizens have not beer
â¢ unmin( lfiil offys, but We -contributed and
are contributing largely and liberally for oui
r . ' 11 w *"lft they are dwjg this wtli'it look
j well to take advantage of their abfeace : it
was not done in '93 âwe undoubtedly pof
-1 v. 8 . ri Â£ht to vote for whom we please,
ut in the exercifc of that right, I hope we
: will be guided by rtjafon and refle&ion.
: W.
â¢'! MR. FENNO,
. I objeft to no man as a legislator, who
i. as pharafter and talents for the ibition. I
: would not, however, fclect a rtinu for a Sena
[ tor, because he. wa* a merchant, mechanic
- or publican, or because he had, in either of
. those chapters, performed an office of hu
manity. "Vy ill any one who values the pri
" of an ele&or, chufe a man to legislate
011 the great and intricate concerns of a state,
merely because he had risked his life in nurs
ing the lick, or because he had made a for
rune by keeping a public house J I believe
the annals of electioneering do not contain
limilar reasons for railing a man to the sta
tion of legislator ; no others have been of
fered (to my knovvjedge) in the pre Tent
inltance. Israel Israel is objefted to not (im
ply for being a publican ;/but &ing apublican,
and his friends not pretending that he pos
sesses the irquilite qualifications for a legisla
tor, the circumstance of his being a fiiiblican
renders his being chosen totally improper.
There is nothing in the insinuation that he
is a republican, and objefte'd to on that ap
count. Mr. Israel is not set up by his friends
as a republican, but as a man " who rificed
his health in relieving the fufferings of his
indigent fellow-citizeiis." A retrofped of
a few years will (hew that it is utterly im
possible he (hould havf been cfcntemplat?d as
a friend either to our general or state govern
ment. If, therefore, we. do, not m an.-to
displace the mod efficient man in theSenatj,
our votes will be given fWH amin R.
Morgan, who ic, part all controveiTy, a
Republican, for he is a friend to the consti
tution of the state, and of the United States.
Let the citizens, -therefore; attend the
ele&ion,. and vote against what is called the
Democratic Republican ticketâthe success
of that ticket would be more injurious to the
city and state than the yellow fever.
CIVIS.
From the American Daily Advertiser.
Messrs. Claypoole,
The election to-morrow is an extremely
important one. Every citizeti who has the
welfare of his country at heart, (hould there
fore attend and give an houeft vote,, Such
as happen to be out of town ought surely
not to be deterred from the exetcife of'their
right offuffrage, on this important occasion.
b" any which they might imagine
they would poflibly run by venturing into
the city as far is the State-house. Byufmg
proper precautions, and avoiding the city
till they can strike into Chefnut-ftreet, they
cannot be said to run any rid;'at' all; that
part of the city being rttarly as'healthy as
ever. They (hould refleft Â«n the importance
of the occasion, and on the danger, if they
are remiss, of a set of men being given to the
city as representatives, who could have no
chance in common times. On Rich an "oc
casion it certainly behoves every Wll-wither
to the true interest ofhi3 country, \o throw
aside any personal fear that might clafli with
an abfblute duty to the public.
