> Friday, May u.f f
| (Concluded from yefler djy't Gazette. J
Mr. Gallatin fa.d, it was true, tliat lie
e had connived the idea of danger from an in
s valion from Europe, during the prflent sea
. lon, was given up. He had drawn this con
. clufion from the manner in which gentlemen
c had (upported their opinion again ft his morion
! to Itrikeout the firlt fedtion. It was then da
ted by tiie gentleman trum South Carolina and
others, that there existed danger in a certain
quarter. The gentleman fron! South Carolina
â  t even pointed out the very individual spot at
I i which the enemy was to land, the route they
e | were to take, and almolt every encampment
; they were to make until they got to the walls
, j of (Jharlefton. When he (aid he thought the
t' idea of danger from Europe was given up,
' he did not forget what fell from the Speaker
' 1 yesterday; but having heard that Gentleman
i calling the army of England, the army of America,
j i and at the fame tune speaking of falling
_, mountains, unfurled banners See. he could not
. conceive him to be serious in any thing he
, said, and he really had considered the whole
yj of his fpeec'h as merely allegorical. But the
y committee were now told by the gentleman
i j from S. Carolina that there is a probability
c ! of an invasion from
" j there was a pqMUity, he would not have said
1 j it was impollible, as very improbable events
'â¢! fometinies take place ; but when the house
" legislated, they ought not to do it us on pofiibi*
e lilies, but upon probabilities, and all that had
. been said in favour of this bill that was pro
. bable, was what had been advanced as to the
e dangerto be apprehended fqom the Weft lu
dies. Every thing else he looked upon as be
> yond probability.
* Mr. G. desired to know upon what this pro
' bability of an invasion from Enrope lay ? He
n willied, inltead ot faying that the armament
now preparing in France oftonfibly agtnnit En
gland, might come against this country, to
fay why they think so J The argument of the
- gentleman from S. Carolina was of a lingular
nature ; it amounted to this. The French
Directory are extremely wife and have the
bell information relative to England: but it is
. itapoflibleitofucceedin an invasion against this
country, therefore ilifi armament must be
intended against this country. He must
e own he was not (truck very forcibly by
such reafoninz. As to the impoflibility
of invading England, he knew nothing of
f it. He believed the success of the event
would depend upon the reli/tance made in
England; and it appeared to him, from what
was taking place there, that they do believe
in the poiTibility of an invasion, and are deter
mined to refilt any attack which may be made.
But if the principle laid down by the gentle
man frein S. Carolina, that the Government
8 of France is wife, and have good information,
is admitted, they will have the wisdom and
information net to attempt iaipradticabilitics,
but apply their means to effect objects which
will bÂ» of service to them. But an invasion of
this country could neither be u(eful to the
men in power in that government nor produce
the lealt advantage to the Nation. The re
fourees of that Nation, powerful as it is,
do not consist of money, or a great navy, by
. which to carry on projects at a diftance'from
home. They have men in great abundance,
and the Government can lay hold of any thing
they pteafe to support them. But we know j
the' lituation ot their finances ; we know they
have called for a forced loan in support of tjie
intended invasion against England. They
wanted only 40 millions of French livres for
â¢ that important objeift, not quite two millions
: sterling, and were not able to raise it in the
usual way. We know that they wanted mo
ney from us, and from Hamburg, for the
laine purpose, and have in fatt been trying to
raise money every w here on the credit of their
'Dutch refcriptions. Thus (ituated, Mr. G.
alked how gentlemen ceuld imagine that the
Frenchcould undertake to invade a country
like this at 1200 leagues distance from hwme f
No Nation who had not the moltextenfive re
sources, both as to money and (hipping, could
undertake such a project, and it was well
known that France is greatly deficient in both,
and therefore cannot come with a fleet here.
But luppoling France was able to make an
attack on this country, he wifiied to know
what was to be her objeft > Was it to (u'bju
gate our country? Suppose they had it in
their power to fend over and land here an ar
my ot-40,000, or of 100,000 men, could it
come into the head of any man, that they
wouldbeablitofubjugate this country ? Sup
pose they were to conquer a partâpolfelting
different manners, and speaking a different
language from the people here, they could
not expett to' become incorporated with'the
citizens of this country and must finally be
expelled. Indeed, it appeared to him thac this
invasion by the army of England was one of
the molt extraordinary ideas that ever enter
tered the head of a Politician or Statesman.
When it must be fecn that England isthe ob
ject of this armament, as the only enemy
France has left; when it must be evident that
no greater ohjeit can be contemplated by that
country than'either deltroying their rival, or
by ptoducing a revolution in the British Go
vernment, to secure the (lability of theirown :
to tell the committee, that notwithstanding
nvery appeaiaiice to the contrary, these pre
parations were probably intended against this
country, was, to use the language (ometimes
adopted by the Gentleman from S. Carolina,
to presume too tar on the credulity of this
Houle.
But is there any reason, from any thing
which has taken country and
France, to believe that such a design really
exists in.the French Councils i It had been
laid that that Government had threatened in
withfuchancvent. Hewjlhed to know uswhat
manner, and how the threat had been made i
The only threat which he recollected was the
threat made by one of those agents (X, Y or
Z he did not recollect which) who said to our
Coinmiflioners, " if you do not agree to such
and such propositions, we will doâÂ«hat f
Send an army to invade you i Nofome fri
gates (hall be sent from the Weft Indies to ra
vage your coalts." With what design was
this threat made ?
Mr. Harper afked.whetherornotthe fate
of Venice was mentioned ?
Mr. G laid, if the gentleman would fuf
fer him to proceed, he would notice what was
laid respeCting Venice also. The design of
these agents wits evidently to frighte* our
CommifltonersaDd toestwrmoney from the ill.
But do thev threaten them with danger which
were improbable f No; they knew if rliey
had done so, oifr Coinmiflioners, would have
laughed at them. They therefore, spoke of
things which partook of probability.
But those agents reminded our conitniffion
erÂ» of the fate of Venice. And are gentlemen
afraid of this country experiencing the fate ot
Venice? Did not thele agent?, in the fame
breath that they spoke of the fatfe of Venice,
acknowledge that tt was impollible to subjugate
this country. Mr. G. quoted that part of
the dispatches where these agents asserted to
the truth of that position as dated by our en
voys.
But it appeared to him that the gentleman
from S. Carolina had himfelf this day, at the
fame time that be declared the danger exilt
ed, concluded that the danger could not exist
for this year. Forif he apprehended any por
tion of the army of England would come a
gainit this country this season, he certainly
would wi(h for a larger number of men than
10,000 ; he wouldjiave agreed with his col
league (Mr. Sitgreaves) and voted for 20,000.
But he (ays he will not do this, as he does
believe any danger will arise before the
next feflion of Congrsfs, which will require
a larger number of men to oppose them than
10,000. Believing with the gentleman from
S. Carolina, that no danger was to be expected
from Europe, Mr. G. said, hewilhcdto re
duce the numocf to 5,000.
Mr. G. said, he did not intend'to have said
any thing upon this amendment; but as the
gentleman from S.Carolina had dwelt much
upon the danger to be apprehended from an
invasion from the army of England, he could
not refrain from making a few remarks upon
that ("object. He Could not imagine how such
an idea could have entered into the head of
any gentleman ; but since fonie had brought
their minds into such a (late as to apprehend
luch an event, he did not expedt that any
thing which he could fay, would operate up
on thern ; but he expected they must vote in
favor of railing the whole of the 20,000 men
at ence. But as to those who could fatisfy
themfelyfcs that the only danger to be appre
hended was from the Weft Indies, he thought
it must be evident that 5,000 men would be
fufficient for every puYpofe to which
they could be ufefully employed. And it
would be perfectly clear that they would on
ly cod the United States halt the money.
There were also (ome gentlemen in the
house, Mr. G. said, who, though they did not
expedt an attack from France at present, ex
pected it whenever a peace (hall take place
with England j he had himfelf no (uch ap
prehenlion, as he believed that system of plun
der which was occasioned by war would
end with war, and as no particular vengeance
had been threatened against us, although he
did not deny some personal resentment exist
ed between the Executive of that country
and that of America ; but this being confin
ed to a few individuals was lets dangerous in
its nature, and would cease whenever tlje
men were out of power. But to those gentle
men, however, he would remark, that the
less money we expend in the mean time, the
better we (hall be prepared to meet danger
when it comes.
Mr. Dennis said, he was one of those who
thought, that if that house were to aft more,
and talk less, it would be mere honourable to
themselves, and profitable to the country.
Under this impreflion, he had fat with pati
ence to hear gentlemen debate the present
fubjedt, without intending to take any part
in the difcuflion. He had heard the gentle
man from Pennsylvania, day after day, admi
nister powerful opiates to the committee j
but he now begun to think it was time to ra
lift theni, and he rofe> for that purpose.
Were he as confident as the gentleman from
Pennlylvania appears to be, that we (hould
be fully adequate to repel every toÂ« who
might attack 11s, without railing any troops
for Otir defence until we lliall 1*- engaged in
atttial War; if he ccuild be fatisfied to have
fonle of the Hates, ravaged and plundered,
and perhaps tnany parts of the United States
aeluged with blood, before we'could collect
dforse to repel the enemy, he might acquiesce
in the dodtrine of that gentleman. But he
did not agrtfe with him, that becaufevve can
not effeftnally guard every part of our coast,
that we ought not to guard any part of it; anv
more than he could agree with him in a simi
lar opinion withrefpect to the defence of our
commerce, but that if we could not profeit
it eftedtuÂ»lly, we ought to proteit it as far as
we are able.
Mr. D. believed this country was in much
greater dange/ - of invasion than the gentleman
from Pennsylvania was willing to allow. He
would not ablolutely fay we (hould be invad
ed, but he thought such an event very proba
ble. We know, said he, that thÂ»re is a lafge
body of troops collected on the fhortjs of
France and a number of (hips of the line, and
other velfels, adequate to the transportation of
a large number of troops. We are told, said
l.e, that these men, and these vessels, are in
tended for the invasion of England. But was
it not known that the -French were pursuing
two systems ? They have not only the in
-vafion, and consequent subjugation of England
in view ; they have another system, in which
he believed they placed more confidence than
in the other, which was, to cut off the re
fourcfes of the British Nation, and how could
they more effectually do this than by getting
such an influence in this country as (hould cut
off her trade to it ?
To wound Great Britain through flttr (ides,
Mr. D. (aid, had been the object of the de
predations which France had for a long time
committeduponourcommerce. The relources
of England were got chietty from this eountry
and the Weft Indies; and though the force
which the French had collected on their
fliores might not be fufficient for an attack
upon England, it might be fufficient for an in
vasion and subjugation of this country, and
by that means, effetfually cut off therefources
of Great Britain. And what Mr. D. asked,
was to prevent this measure from taking
place ? All agree that the British uuvy might"
if that Nation were dilpofed to do so, prevent
it. But are gentlemen wilting to depend upon
ths British Navy for protectionâa Nation,
whom, it is frequently (aid, would rejoice In
our deli ructionâa J' ation, whole animolities
against 11s are very greatâand who, according
to the dottrine of lome gentlemen, consider
us as the greatefl rivals ? He believed fer
himfelf, that we ought not to repose any con
fidence in Great Britain, or any other Nation.
He believed the time was arrived when we
ought to take meat'nres for us.v owe feenritv.
[Volume XIII.
I If, said Mr. 1). (here be any difpolitioii o'H
the part oflhc Britilh Nation to conciliate thÂ«
affeotions of this Nation, with a view of draw
ing us into an alliance with her, he asked in
what way it might be mofl effectually done f
If Great Britain calculated on our triendfhip*
it mult be in proportion to our enmity wit|i
France, and (be will be glad to do any thing,
or fuffer anything to be done, which shall
have a tendency to produce that enmity ?
And how could this be 11101# effectually 'done
. than by fufferinga few French (liips, with 3<J
or 40,000 men, to come out and invade this
country > Such an event could not fail to ex
cite thebittered animofityagainfl the French
Nation, which would beequivalent toafriend 7
ship for Britain.
If he thought with the gentleman fronj
Pennsylvania, that an invafiou from Europe
was a mere bugbear, of phantom, and that it
was raised merely with a view of getting a
(landing army, to increase the power of the
Executive, he should not have made use of
many of the arguments which that gentleman
had used. He had not been sparing in his
descriptions of the horrors and calamities of
war; he hacf painted them in the moll fin
king colours. And why has he done tjiis ?
IF there be no danger of invasionâis there be
no danger of our commercial resources being
derangedâif small predatory incursions can
only be expected upon our territoryâif our
duties on impoltÂ« and tonnage will encreale,
no direCt tax can be necessary to (iipport the
deficiencies of our revenue, and all the hide
ous pictures which the gentleman has drawn
about the calamities of war, mult banilh into
air. It was because he apprehended an inva
sion, and a coufequent diminution of our re
sources, that he (Mr. D.) had fupporfed
measures of defence, and bt' revenue to meet
the expence of those measures. Was it in
order toÂ«prevent little predatory incuriious,
which our militia woufc be able to repel, that
we have so long forborn to protect our com
mercial rights f Was it for this that we were
told, we had better submit to partial lodesâ
that we had better give up the whole of our
commerce, than provoke a war? Was this
the fort of war of which the gentleman was
so much afraid f Was thit the danger, to a
void which, it was propoled to give up the
whole of our carrying trade to a nation againlt
which gestlenien have so great an enmity ?
Certainly not.
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania tells
the committee, that though he is against rai
sing an army at present, if the territory should
be invaded, he would then not be for raising
a partial army, but an army adequate to our
1 defence. The gentleman may believe this
lat present; he would not fay that he had not
! confidence in thedeclaration ; but, from his
experience of that gentleman's mode of creep
ing out of any promises which he had made,
induced him to believe, that if a foreign army
was in the heart of the country, he would
(till find some arguments againÂ® raising a
(landing army.
Gentlemen continually infiftupon it, that
unorganized and undisciplined as they are,
our militia are able to defend us againlt the
mod powerful army that can be brought a
gainst us. So great is their objection to a
standing army, and their apprehenfionof Ex
ecutive patronage, that they are afraid of e
v;n raising 10,000 men, left ,they fliolild de
flroy the liberties of the .people, in spite of
all the militia in the country.
Mr. D. concluded by faying, that there
was great danger in conceiving ourselves too
secure. He believed we had resources which
if called forth, would enable 11s to defend
ourselves against the world ; but if we decli
ned-to use them, and rely for defence upon a
disorganized militia, this security might te
fatal to us. Indeed all the arguments of tbe
gentleman from Pennsylvania went to fliew
rather an extreme jealousy ofou'rowngovern- '
ment than any apprehenlions from a foreign
foe. He hoped, therefore, the motion would
be negatived.
Mr. Brooks hoped the motion would not
prevail, for as the gentleman from Pennsyl
vania has declared that he is the bill
altogether, it might beexpected that he would
do all i* his power to make it ineffectual.â
The gentleman from Pennsylvania has said
that there is not the lealt danger of war, and
therefore it is not neceliary to raise 10,000
men He was a little fiirprized, alÂ«er that
gentleman had declared day day, that if
such and such measures were taken, thev
would involve the country "in war, and those
measures' had been agreed Upon, that he
should now fay there is no danger of war. He
fays that France can have no idea of subju
gating a country so capable of defence as we
are; but the gentleman seemed to have for
gotten what had been said about the drvifion
ofopinionin this country, upon which liefup
pofed the French principally relied. He ho
ped France was m-.ftaken'in Her expectations
on this subjeCt; yet, if (he only lent 10,003
men against us, he should wi(h the country to
be in a situation to receive them. If France
was persuaded, that the moment her dandard
was ereCted on our shores, one half the people
would flock to it, (lie might be induced to
Tend .out an army against us; and-if so, he
wiflied to have 10,000 men in aid of our mili
tia, to meet them. He luppofed the molt ef
fectual way of preventing any attack was to
fliew ourselves ready to refill it whenever it
conies.
The gentleman from Pennfylvaniawas mod
fruitful in resources. When he is defeated
in one point, he takes up another, and meets
you on every fide. But amopgU all ii:e exl
traordinary things he said was, that because
the French had different habits, and spoke a
different language from the people of this
country, they were not likely to obtain a.iv
permanent interest here. He did not think,
there was any weight in this remark ; he did
nof think the French manners and the French
language were so very obnoxious to th. peo
ple of this country as they were reprelented â¢
he believed the difference betwixt the gentle
man himfelf and those manners and that lan
guage, would not be found very grcar.
Mr. B'. said he would not dotain the com
mittee longer, bee au I; he was confident the
motion would not be agreed to. He had him
felf been always in favour ps railing 20,000
men, but upon the seleCt committee he w is
induced to agree to 10,000, from the confi
deration that the Prelident would have the
power of calling out and organizing 10,000
militia.
Mr. Macon kid, if gentlemen were de
termined to have war at any rate, they had
better to bring fore, arc) at once a propefmoh.
to that ctfcrt ; but whilst we are in â !!â¢;Â«âof peacr, and there is no to break
.if, h ! with 3d to as in .1 lUte of peace.â ,
Gentlemen had Ipoken of the true touchstone,
and ot parties; \he true distinction of party
in that house seemed to be> â  hat certain gen
tlemen are determined to take every means
which leads to expence and patronage, and
others arc as determined inoppoling that ex
ycncc and that patronage. He belived this
v. as in Congrefsthe trne criterion of party
Therefore when augmentations of our mili
tary force were contemplated, it was ftiewn
to the House where they were to be employ
ed, and the propriety of theincreafe was tes
ted by the neceflity which was thewn for
them; but now, because the French govern â¢
raent, or somebody for them, has (aid some
foolilh things, an array is toberaifed, without
faying how, or where it is to be employed.
Is there, said Mr. M. a man in the counffy,
who is nor blinded by party spirit, who can
believe that the French government knew any
thing of the unauthorized conversations held
with our CommilfiOners in Paris? Is there
an American who believes that one half the
people of ihis countryitre devoted to Francfc?
It could not be believed.
If the people of Charleston, or any other
place, think ihemfelves in danger, he was
willing to let them have as many troops as
ihey a!ked for; but, as had been nated, 5000
were a greyer ftumbfr than had been (hewn
to be necefl'ary. He was opposed to the bill
altogether, as he latf no neceflity for it. He
believed f any nation chose to make an at
tempt to latvi men in this-cotintry, the militia
would be able to kill them as fa(t as they
could be brought. He hoped wever again to
fee whut lie saw in the late waf âAmerican
armed again It American. If ever we were a
gain called to arms, he trusted there would be
but one sentiment in America, as to the pro
priety or justice of the cause in which we
fight.
Gentlemen talked loudly about the Inde
pendence of the country, as if they were the
lole guardians of it. Could it be supposed
that men who had fought to gain that inde
pendence, would now be more willing than
they who had taken no part in the contest, to
relinquilh the prize to any Nation ? It could
ny be supposed. Nor could he believe with
the gentleman from New-Jersey (Mr. Day
ton) that the Army of England could be in
tended for this country. He underltood thar
Army was proposed ia be sent ov# to Eng
gland in open Doats, whichgentierhen would
not contend could bring them hither. He
believed that it was not proper on this, or on
any Â»ccafion, where danger was apprehended,
to (hew a distrust of our countrymen, fromany
difference of political opinion which may exiit
amongfl them ; for, whatever maybe their va
rianee io that rei'petfl whenever an enemy ap
per.rs, they will unite in repelling him. At to
what had been faicl about the fbhjugati 11 cf*h s
country*, it waÂ«- id'e. He did not believe that .
all the powers of Europe united could fubjagate
the United States. Ht should be in favor or
5,:oo men, because they would only cost hall
theexpence of jo,coo
The queAion for striking out 20,000 to insert
5,000, was put and negatived 4J to 41
The qneftion novv returned upon striking out
so,ooo to insert io,coo.
Mr. N. Smith hoped this amend men
would not be agreed to. It was contempla
ted, when this reduction was proposed, that
the power should be given to the President
for three years; b llt w as now reftricled to
the recess of Congress. He did not himfelf
think that at present there was any danger of
an invalion, nor did he believe that imminent
danger of an invasion would ex'rft, whilst the
war continued betwixt France af*lÂ«England ;
but, whenever a peace lhall take place be
twixt those two powers, the que/fion ought
then to be this country ought
not immediately to go into preparations for
war, and if Congress were nDt in feflion at
the time, the President ought to have the
power of deternjffiing this question. It will
depend on several circumfhmcesâ 011 what
kind of Peace was madeâupon what ground
parties flood when peace was made âÂ®n the
"iituation of France dtfthe timeâon what kind 1
of men are in power-âon the situation of this
countryâon what is the slate of parties here
at the time âwhat is the number of those who '
are opposed to the governmentâhow many 1
there tire of those who wi/Ti to lull the reft to j
deep âand what is the amount of spies in the
country. All these will be important conta-
derations to be decided at the time, and if it 1
flial! tiic . appear that imminent danger does 1
exist, will 20,000 men be too large a number I
to raise ? lie believed nor.
Another consideration of great importance .
wis, the language which the house would '
hold to Europe in adopting this amendment.
It is laid, that in cafe of invasion, war, of
imminent danger, ac.ooo men will be too '
many to-be raised ; we will only raise 10,000.
He did not think luth language the most pro- I i
per on such anoccalion,
If, the French invade this eountry, it mult
he with a view to fubjngate it ; and if so, it '
nmft be done through the nte'lium of a Re- '
volution ; and it the date of parties at the '
time anthorifes an expectation of fue'eefs, we J
may expeft them here. And though he be. (
lieved, with other gentlemen 011 this floor, â 
that therfc is no'danger of an invasion at pre- 1
fant, it was because he believed the opinions
frequently exprelTed imthis house by the gen
tleman front Pennsylvania and others, were
not very prevalent out of doors. If- they
were, he (hould count upon nothing less than
Revolution and Subjection. To provide for
the raising of lets than jo,ooo men, would in â¢
his opinion, rather invite attack, than serve
to repel it ; and as the men would not berai-,
(cd, except tjiey were wanted, there could
be 110 reasonable hesitation about the matter. <
The queltion for striking out 10,000, and
inserting 10,000, was put and carried, 54 J
in favourofit.
The queftinn next came upon agreeing to
the section proposed by the seleCt committee, 3
for authorizing the President, from time to '
time, as he fli.ill deem it neceflary, to call
forth in rotation such portions, not exceeding i
at any one tiir.c the number ps ao,ooa men of ;
the detachments of the militia of the United ,
States, authorized by the aft of the 14th June

: I Potts, jun. Secretary ; âthe following
t resolutions were unanimonflv agreed to *.
Hairing contemplated, with anxious soli
, citude and approbation, the repeated efforts
made by the Executive, to terminate the
I differences between this country and the
French Republic j and having observed,
| with aftonilhment and indignation, that
those advances towards a reconciliation,
. have not only uiet with pointed neglefl and
> indignity, but that infamous attempts have
been made to coriupt the integrity of 'our
> government, and to subvert the happiness
and independence of our country;
Therefore, ,
Resolved, That the present interesting
crisis imperiously demands thai the govern
ment should be fully assured of the unlimited
confidence and support of its conftituenu.
Rcfolved, That a eommittee be appointed
to prepare an addrefsto be prefcnted to the
President, exprdfive of the foregoing senti
ments, apd alTuring him of our firm de
termination to support tSe government of
our choice in every measure it may deem
necessary to maintain the rigWts, honor, and
independence of our conntry.
Whereupon, John Brooke, Robert E.
Hobart, Bartholomew YVamback, Henry
Miflnncr, and Francis R. Potts, were ap
pointed, who reported the following ad
dress, which was anatiimoufly adopted. â¢
People of Poll's Town and its vicinity,
in Montgomery county, Pennsylvania,
To JOHN ARAMS,
President of the United States.
Sir, '
WE have been accustomed to observe in
silence, though not with indifference, those
political occurrences which affeft the hnp
pinefs and prosperity of our-country. The
present eventful crisis, however, imposes on
us a new duty, and we comply with its ob
ligation with cheerfulnefs :n exprefiing to
you, the firft officer of our government,
those sentiments with which we are at pre
feut actuated.
We allure you, therefore, that we have
cordially approved of the firm, yet temper
ate system adopted by the Executive in its
intercourse with the government of the
French Republic. With anxious solicitude
we have awaited the event of these overtures
dictated by a spirt of dignified forbearance
and condufted with the firmnefs of con
scious integrity, which have been made with
a view to an amicable adjuflment of the
differences between the two countries.
But, Sir, though we desired an adjullment
upon terms compatible with the honor and
dignity of the United States, upon those
terms only we desired it, ai d we have seen,
with inexpreflihle indignation, the infamous
attempts which have been made upon the
integrity of our govern ment, by threaten
ing the peace and happiness of our country,
unless preferred at the price, us national de
gradation.
With tlje virtuous spirit, therefore, of
Republicans, we join, we trnft, the general
voice, in rejecting with disdain the igno
minious alternative ; resolved to preserve
inviolate, at the facrince, if necessary, of
property and life, the honor and indepen
dence of our country, and to leave them
unsullied, a sacred deposit with our pos
terity.
While a review of the measures of your
adminiflratioti impresses us with a sense of
your wisdom and firmnefs, it infpire3 us
with a confidence that you will not surren
der any of the rights of the nation, and that
its interest and happiness will Hill continue
, the objeft of your meritorious exertions.
Resolved unanimoujly, That the foregoing
nddrefs be signed by the Chairman and Se
cretary, on behalf of this meeting, and
forwarded to John Chapman and Samuel
Sitgreaves, Efqwires, Representatives in
Congress from this diftriit, to be by them
prefetited to the President of the United

gentlemen,
WE live in times, when it is almost
impossible to observe with indifference, or
in silence, those political occurrences, which j
a fie A the happiness and prosperity of our
country.
The cordial approbation and refpe& you
avow of the firm and fyftem,
adopted by the Executive authority of go
vernment, in its intcrcourfe with the go
vernment of the Fre: ch Republic,, is very
fatisfa&ory : You desired an adjuftmeut
upon terms compatible with the honor and
dignity of the United States, and upon these
terms only : You have seen, with inex- ;
prefiible indignation, the infamous attempts
which have been made upon the integrity ;
of our government, by threatening the I
peace and happiness of your country, unless i
preserved at the price of national, degrada- I
tion : You resolve to prtferve inviolate, et 1
the facrificc of life and property, the honor <
and independence of your country, and to <
leave them u.* sullied, a sacred deposit with 1
posterity : and in' declaring, these sentiments t
to the world, you have deserved we 1 of a
your country. f
Your confidence, that I will not furren- ii
der the rights of the Nation, fbali not be a
- betrayed : If the nation wee capable of
fnch a surrender, which ft is 11 t, some
other hand must affix the signature to the
ignominious deed.

To the President of the United States.
S 1 R,
THE intereftmg crisis to which the Unit
ed Sates are at lalt driven by the rSpacity,
wickednefj, and ambition of the French 1
Government, tails loudly and explicitly up- I
on us to unite in defence of our country ; and
by displaying that unanimity o the worU, c
to convince our enemies, that the people are i
not d.vided from their Gsvernment.
There remains not the doubt that
their piojeft of plundering this part of the
globe, is very much strengthened by the sal- '
llacious idea that the Executive ol the U it
ed States hath contravened the wilhes and
sentiments of the people at large in his inter
course with foreign nations.
To repel this falft and mischievous calum
ny arfar as lies in our power, by bearing a ,
public and unequivocal teftimoney in favour
of your Adminiftratio'i, and tfpecially in
behalf of the !ate attempt to negociate a
t eaty of peace with the French Nation, is
both cur motive and apology for intruding
on you with' this A jdrefs.
If our situation has becone in any degree
serious or alarming, Ve are highly gratified
in the refle&iort it has not proceeded from
any want of temperate and judicious mea
sures, on your part to prevent it.
The relative conduit of the United States
and of France, at this eventful period, must,
form a striking contrail, in the judgment of
the candid and discerning part of mankind ;
and history w ll hereafter be at a loss which
to admire most, the impudent profligacy
and exorbitant demands of the French, in
order to plunge us into war, or the anxious
and unremitted efforts of the United Sates
to avoid it. While we thus express our un
refcrved approbation of the conduit of the
firft Magiflrale, we cannot omit the oppor
tunity of declaring, that we have the most
entire confidence in your wisdom, integrity,
and political fortitude ; and that we trust,
by the bleflings of Heaven, upon the Exccu
tive and Legislative Councils of our country, 1
aided ty the patriotism of the People, we
shall be enabled to support our independence,
in defiance of an enemy, who not only spurns
at ourtriiniileri of peace, but openly avows
of an intention of compelling us to yield the lad

PARIS, March 27.
By another arret, of the 26th Ventofe,
(lsÂ«h March) the commune of Berg rac
has been declared in a Kate of siege, The
true motives which have produced this arret
arse, that the partizans of royalty have en
deavoured to mislead the public trfind, and
have planned troubles, which they intended
to bring forth at ths enfuisg eledions, by
fending ferret agents among the inhabitants
of the country, causing the deluded farmer!
tofign a defamatory libel againfl the confli
cted authoritiesÂ«of the department ; that
the malevolent-os that commune, have de
termined to carry the rallying standard, and
have resolved to choose the officers of the
National guard, from among the enemies of
tie government ; in fine, that they are
leagued with those of Bourdeaux, theconfe
quences of whieh it is impossible to forefee.
By another arret of the 28th Ventofe,
(17th March) the Executive direflory has
appointed citizen Lecarlier, adminiflrator
of the department of L'Aifne. to be com
missary of the government, near the army
of the French republic in Switzerland. Ci
tizen Mengaud, charge d'affairs bf the re
public at Bade, and citizen Mangouret, re
sident of the republic at Valais, will conform
themselves to the inflru&ions which citizen
Lecarlier (hall give them, in consequence of
those which he will receive from the execu
tive direftory.
A report has prevailed for these few days

French fleet which failed from Corfu, com
posed of 40 (hips of the line, besides fri

arrived at Syracuse in Sicily.

Wl\ilft captain Thompson Jay there, the
ship of Boil on, arr ved fr m Algiers,
lali from Gibraltar, having on boar the
crew of the Crescent frigate, who were re
turning home. The captain of,the Sarah
informed captain Thompftm, that just ofT
Madeira, he was fired at by a privateer, tin
ker Englifti colours, but he supposed flie
was French, from their calling to him in
bruken E-glifh to heave to. He accord
ingly flacked his com fe, but the privateer,
i 1 coming up, Hill continued firiiiJi and or
dered him to hoist out his boat and come
along foJe. This he rc/ufed to do, but told
the privateerfman that if he would come
along fide his veflel, he would shew him his
papers and give him all necefTary fntisfac
tion. Upon this the privateer discharged a
broadside into the ship, which did no other
damage than cutting some of the rigging,
The' guns of the Sarah were soon brought
to bear, and Hie returned thefdute with as
warm a broadside, which the privateer not
liking altogether, * thought it moil prudent
to sheer yrf.
The vapouring 9 of poor Sttrgo us profim and
his party remind one of the Bjloonift who, af

upon the earth and fluttered to pieces.
" Rife," cries Bsche, "-ere it be too late"â
Rife, and redress your wrong*: But ah ! he
cries in vain. The cruel Aate of his party re
femblgp that of a wounded serpent ; which, in
attempting to ascend a precipice, is hurled con
tinually lower. Not all the malice of all ill
stars combined, can raise again his powers to
that " bad eminence," whence towering virtue
lately hurled thrm. If Bache is ever exalted, it
will be to the flation of Frometheus, where the
excruciating vulture cf public scorn, 44 tundens
tmmoiHcle jscur," will amply punish the dif*
grace and injuries heaped on his country, by the
venality, perfidy ar.d malice oÂ£ a base and un
natural miscreant.
An unhappy man put a period to his exigence
a few days iince, in a fit of despair, by taking
Laudanum. The frequency of suicides and
murders, is become an abuudant and diftrefiing
fjurce of lamentation. These are the firft fruits
of French principlesâthe natural and inevitable
.emanations of that philosophy, which teaches
us tofubftitute passion for reason, and a visiona
ry and fantaftic compound 6f atheififi vanity
aiid vice, for a pore and rational morality. Be
fore w.e knew the contaminating influence of,
these corrupt difcipJe9, we were a free, a virtu
ous and a happy people. Here man raised not
his callous hand against himfelfâmuch less
against his neighbor. But alas ! qu& domustam
â l*bilis ? After corrupting our virtue, by the
maiign influence of their manners and principles
theitep was.(h.'it to undermining our freedom.
Tije magnanimous constancy of a few in refill
ing their wiles alone saved us. In order to re
main secure from future aflaults, We must be
called back to our primitive purity. A people
whose manners and principles are loose and cor
rupt, can never long enjoy freedom. Virtue is
the ouly solid foundation for liberty and happi- ,
ness.
" Tho 9 fortune's blackefljlorms rage on his house,
The man whose pious foul re veres the Gods y

All history teaches us, that noextenfive eon

ger the hour of retribution i 3 put off, the more
hravily will the vengeance fall, Judging from
part experience, her conquests must very l'peedi
ly be difiipated. Av quifitions io extensive, hare
rarely been lo The immense
empire raised by Philip of iVacedon, in a very
few years, vaniifeed iike a dream. The exten
sive inn ads of the barbarians, were soon put a
Hop to, and terminated in many instances, in
their own subjugation. All past experience con- '
firms the fail, that re-a&ion agai ;lt ambition
and rapacity, is as natural and inevitable as the
as the return of a pendulum in its vibrations.â
At times, indeed, this rc-a<fl;on is rendered so
remote, by the intervention of incidental causes
that the connexion is loft to inattentive minds :
In the instance of France, there is every ground
to believe this will not be the cafe. So rapid
and incautious has been ber rrmrche viSorieufe,
thatlbe has not waited to confirm one flep, be
fore (he has advanced with another : this addtd
to the unexampled rapacity and oppreflio 1 exer
cised over al! her conquests, her preposterous
vanity, in impaling her own motley creed, her
uncouth code, and her difgufling and offenfive
manners, upon the miserable vi&ims of her am
bition ; all conspire to ensure the rapid recoil
of juit and rigorous revenge. Her immense
colossal fabric of conquest, reared on the ru'.ns
ot humanity and reason ; that monstrous ?nd ill
conne<9ed form, whose gigintjc strides, disdain
ing alj constraint, she is now leeking to dÂ»re<s\
across " the main of waters," requires a less fee
ble shock to overturn it, than is generally imag
ined. Framed I y accident, and adapted only
f the temporary use of roocnihine tyrants, the

The jyfti. e due to the B/Itifh government for
the promptness and equity of decifions on
American claim*, when supported hy
documents, induces me to request you to
in your paper th* following cafe :
In January last I tranfmittcd a claim for a loss
on a quantity of Hour, which being destined to
a French" purt then declared to be in a Hate of
blockade, was taken arid the flour fold at a Bri

; the opportunity I shall w;th pleasure give them
; equal creditâbut ala* ! where are the grounds
for such an expectationâif I look to the d'.f
patches from our Commiflioners, fhill I find it

MR. FES NO,
The following note was received this morn

manner too delicate and interfiling to be
