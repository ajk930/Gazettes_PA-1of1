CONGR E S S.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Thursday, May io.
\Coti6ludtdfrom our iaji .]
Mr. Macon was ftfrpriied to hear the
gentleman last up - fay he had beard nothiag
derogatory to the Militia. He thought*the
bill itfelf ihewed a want of due confidence sri
them. He /aw no object jn it, extrept it was
to get an armed force under the command of
men appointed by the Prelident of the United
States, ratherthan undermen appointed by the
Executive of the federal States. He had heard
no gentleman fay he warned any part of these
men tor the country from whence he came,
except one (Mr. Pinckney) who said that
1300 men would be well employed on the sea
coast of S. Carolina. He v.;as sorry to find
men who opposed the permanency of the land
tax, now, advocating this expence, which he
thought unneceflary, and which if . they
thought necefiary, they ought,to have pro
vided for, He was sorry the gen.tleman from
New York had found so much difficulty in
raising his quota of the 80,000 militia ordered
to be held in readiness. It was the firft diffi
culty he had heard of in that business.
Mr. Williams explained, by laying that
he did not fay there was any difficulty in rais
ing the men, but that it was attended with
considerable expence.
Mr. M. had no doubt of the fame spirit
animating our citizens aga"n>ft any enemy who
! may set their toot in this country, which ani
mated them in the late war. As to -he danger
of invasion, he thought if the gentleman from
S. Carolina (Mr. Pinckney) would compare
his observations of to-day with what he for
merly said on this fubjeÂ£r, he believed they
would not be found very confident with each
other.
Mr. M. said, it was always odious to make
companions betwixt the services of our regu
lar troops and militia, in the war; they both
deserved well. There were instances of bra
very in our Revolution equal to any thing in
the French Revolution. He need only menti
onthe battle of the Cowpensand the battle of
Key Mountain. In the latter, the Militia took
as;many prisoners as tliey carried men at firft
into adtion. There were some i/iftances,
on the contrary, in which the Militia did not
behave well. He had no doubt as to the bra
very and power of the Militia, whenever real
'danger approaches.
When a law was pafled to create expence,
the money must be found. He withed gentle
men to recalled that. He wished to avoid an
unnecefTary expence of a penny. The gentle
man from Maryland (Mr. Smith) had truly
said that money is the Pi new of war, he wiih
ed so be careful of it, though in cafe of neces
sity this country could' do much without
money.
But it was said, that it wattle finable that
this bill should be palled, because it would
produce a good effect in Europe. He did not
lay any ftrels upon this confideraition. Europe
would belittle effe<sled by feeing that we had
passed a law for railing *O,OOO mew, they
knew from experience, that this Country is
able to defend itfelf against any Nation upon
earth.
In actual war, Mr. M. believed a regular
force would not only be necelfary buÂ»t cheaper
thanany other; but if any sudden invasion were
made, every man landed would be cut off by
the Militia, before an army could be raised.
He said this country could never experience a
war like the last. The people were then divi
ded on the question of Independence; but
being become Independent, theie could be
but one opinion about remaining so. There
was a great difference, he said, betwixt the
Militia of this and other countries; here the
people, especially in the country, know well
how to use a gun and to take care of it, which
was a very eHernial part of a soldier ; and
whatever disputes might take place
house, the Militia of the country, from one
end to the other, would be unanimous in the
defence of their country and independence.
He had no fear, therefore, of any enemy.
They might distress us for a time ; but when
ever they landed, there would only be one
sentiment, which would be to drive them off
as soon as poflible. It was acknowledged that
the militia ofS. Carolina was noffo wellarm,4
ed as in some other States, but it was notorU
ous that Cord Cornwallis, when attempting to
pas. through that State was obliged to turn
back, declaring that he was got into a nest of
hornets. He did not believe that all tlie pow
ers of Europe combined can hurt us; as an
enem/ could get poll'eflion of no one place, or
few placesin the country, which could greatly
distress the reft.
Mr. M. concluded by faying, that he had
heard nothing toconvince him of the necefli
ty of railing these men, or of giving the Pre
lident the power to raise rheiu, and therefore
he should be forftriking out the feftion.
A call was made for the queftien.
Mr. Brent was fcnfible, at that late hour,
the patience of the committee must be a good
deal exhaufled. He would trespass upon it
only for a few minutes.
Mr. B. was far from thinking that the con
stitutional objection which had been urged,
was fatisfaCtorily answered. He had heard
nothing which had in the least altered his opi
nion on the fubjeCt. The gentleman from
S. Carolina (Mr. Pinckney) allows that
the doctrine laid down by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania is corredt, as far as it goes to
general principles, but that when he made a
particular application from these general prin
ciples he waswrong. Thegentleman from South
Carolina contended that to authorize the Pre
lident to raise an army under certain contin
gencies, was wot to give him the power to
raise an army. But does not this bill, said
Mr. B. give the Prelident power to deter
mine, under certain contingencies, whether
or not he will raise an army, for fix years to
come i He alked where the line could be
drawn ? He believed if it was right to tranf
fer this power for Jix years, they might doit
for an hundred years. On this head, there
fore, he thought the reasoning of the gcntle
tnan perfectly inaccurate.
But the gentleman trom South-Carolina
has fitppofeu this provision is not unconstitu
tional, because it was allowed by the gentle
man from Pennsylvania and others, if the
contingencies were all fpecific, the provision
would be perfectly constitutional, and as he
aliens the contingency of imminent danger
of an invalion," is as as the
other two cases, viz. a declaration of war,
or an invalid). On this point he differed from
the gentleman from South-Carolina altoge-
ther. War and invasion were explicit; but
when imminent danger of an invaiion is spo
ken of as a contingency, it makes the railing
of the army depend entirely upon the Preli
dent's opinion. Suppose the expreflions were,
" the Prelident of the United States (hall have
power to raise an army whenever he thinks
the situation of public affairs shall render it
necelfary." Would not every one fay, in this
cafe, that power was given to the Prelident
to raise the army when he pleased ? And how
does this-cafe differ from the other ? Who
wBl undertake to fay that the Prelident does
not now think there is imminent danger of an
invasion ? And if it should appear hereafter
that the Prelident had apprehended danger
when none really existed, he would only have
to reply, " that he aÂ£ted agreeably to his
opinion at the time." The question, then,
results to this ground, and before gentlemen
gaVe their votes they ought seriously to consi
der it : can Congress divert themfclvesof the
right of raising an army, by giving it to the
P;elident for fix years, to aÂ£t upon his own
discretion ? If they could, every constituti
onal provision is lighter than chaff ; but, as he
considered the Conft'uution too sacred to be
thus violated, he could never consent to the
measure.
But with refpeft to the expediency, of
which he had already fpokeu, he would add
a few other observations. It was proposed
that this army should be raised for the pro
tection of the southern, and, Asallallow, the
weakell part of the union. Yet all the mem
bers from that quarter (with only two excep
tions) fay they wish no such protection. Yet
gentlemen who came from other extremes ot
the union insist upon their being protected a
gainst their will, and are determined to cram
an army down their throats, whether they will
or not. This was the vioft extraordinary
thing he had seen since he had had a feat in
theJi-giflature of the union.
The gentleman from New-York (Mr.
Williams) though he expressed his inten
tion of supporting this bill, went into a copi
ous panegyric on the militia. It he had not
declared his intention, he should have thought
he would have ftiilconfided in the bravery of
our militia for our defence ; but, notwith
standing his remote situation, he wishes for a
standing army.
Mr. B. said, he did not undertake to fay,
and he was far from believing, that if a for
midableforce was to be landed in this country,
and there was a fettled disposition 011 the part
of France, or any other country, to make
war upon us, that it would not be necessary to
meet such an invasion by a regular force. All
he contended for, was, that an army of 50,000
men would be ineffectual in oppoling the in
vasion ot small marauding parties on our coast,
which was the kind of invasion we have the
most reason to expeCt. The mihtia was the
proper force by which to repel all such at
tacks. For, considering that our southern
coast is 1300 miles in extent, it was not polli
ble that a small standing force coMld be effec
tually distributed upon it. He had himfelf
no idea of any extensive invasion, and if any
such takes place, the militia would be able to
meet them, untif Congress met.
But, in our present circumstances, at a mo
ment wften it is impossible to fay whether we
shall be involved in war, or not ; or, if a war
take place, whether it will be maritime and
predatory war, or we shall be attacked by a
formidable army ; at such a tiiwe to increase
our military eftablilhment, will be to meef a
certain evil, whillt the event it is intended to
repel is most uncertain. He said a certain
evil ; for, however, other gentlemen may
consider them, he considered ltanding armies
as the bane of the liberty and happiness of
every conntry where they are established.
Gentlemen ought to recollect tint they have
ina manner decided this question by a previ
ous vote. It was contended that the land
tax, which was the other day under consider
ation, ought to be laid for a number of years,
in order to have formed a permanent security
for a loan of any money that might be want
ed for the support of this army ; but as that
question was not carried, gentlemen who vot
ed against that, to be confiltent, ought to vote
also againlt this army. Or could they recon
cile it to themTelves, to go into a measure of
this kind, remote as danger appears to be,
upon any conjecture, which may entail upon
them and their polterity a permanent tax up
-6h the land of the country, and that too at a
tune when the alarm which haÂ» been raised
throughout the union, has reduced the price
of produce from tlie highetf rate that was ever
known in this country, almost to nothing. He
w as not willing to do this.
Could it be expected, Mr. B. asked, that
the situation of things could be so greatly al
tered before the next meeting of Congress, a
period of only four or five months f He did
not think it could ; and if danger should then
appear too great to be averted an army might,
perhaps, be raised as soon as if it was let a
bout at this time, when that danger is not so
apparent.- Indeed, in every point of view,
it appeared to him, that to pass this bill,
would be one of the most improper measures
that ever palfed the legiflatureof this country.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) said, that he
had flattered himfelfwith the expectation that
the injuries and insults heaped upon this
Country without ryimber, and aggravated by
a refufal on the part ot the aggressor to re
dress, or even to forbear them, would have
produced an union in the public councils, but
he hadbeen grievously disappointedâhe had
hoped that the communication of the dis
patches from our commissioners, in which we
were threatened with the fate of Milan or of
Venice, unless we consent to become tributa
ries at will to the French republic, would
have united this branch of the legislature so
far at least as respeCted the measures Of de
fence and preservation, but this hope had va
nished. The book of oppolition, which the
member from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin)
had hitherto unfolded with a cautious hand,
and exhibited only in single leaves or detach
ed sheets, was at length opened to their view
in full volume, and the motion under consi
deration with the speech of the mover, might
be ( regavded as the index to it's darkest pages.
In the present critical state of things, Mr.
Dayton said he must be permitted to speak
plainly. Placed as a watchman upon the
walls, he should be unfaithful to his trust, if
he neglected to found the alarm when danger
was approaching. The menaces of distant
danger had already been proclaimed, but here
it was brought more neariy to them, it was in
the midst of thsir very camp. The gentle
man from Pennsylvania had now boldly erect
ed' his standard, and had invited ail disposed
like hurtfelf to rally round it. It was the en-
['Volume XIII.
sign of opposition, not merely to the admini
ftratjon or to the government, but to the, only
effectual measures of 'protection, defence and
preservation, and what, he asked, was th ( <&
motto most proper to be engrav.d upon it's
party-coloured field ; was it such as were feed
upon the colours of the patriotic legions of
1776? Far otherwise ; for on them were to
be seen *' Liberty or Death" â" No one lhali
provoke us with impunity'*âV We riik all
for Independence"â" We will be tributary
to no foreign power"âThese noble fenti
raents strongly exprelfive of American feeling
and resolution, were imprinted in capitals and
in letters of gold upon the standards which
animated our citizens in the memorable sera
of the revolution, and led them to conquest-
Let them be contrasted with the language ot
the mover, who had eretted his figual for ral
lying, caused it's itreamers to be unfurled,
and had chosen for his motto " Weakness
and Submiflion," written it was true in faint
characters, and with a trembling hand, but
{till tco intelligible to escape observation.
Letthofe fays he, wljo chufe it, to fuctl
a standard, but he should arrange Mmftlf lift*
der the opposite banners.
Having exhibited the tendency and cliarac;
ter of the opposition to the principle of the
bill, which the motion went entirely to de
ltroy, he proceeded to remark with what art
and industry the mover had laboured to lull,
thjs country into a fiate of profound indiffer
ence, inactivity and security. 4< lam not
(fays t.l%e member from Pennsylvania) appre
hen five for my own part of an iuvafioii" â
And why should that gentleman be unJerno
apprehension from such an event ? Was'it
that secure in the perteit coincidence of the
principles he avowed with those which Jctu*
ated the furious hordes of democrats which
threatened this country with fubjugatidn, he
felt a confidence of' his own fafetv, even if
they should over run and revolutionize the
datesâWas it that, confiding in the remote
distance of his residence rrom the sea coalt, a
mong the ridges of the Monongahala, he had
determined upon the approach of the invaders
to flee to the rocks and mountains, and call
upon them, not to fall upon and cover him
for that day was not yet arrived, but to shel
ter and hide him from the foes of order and
of mankind. From those distant heights he
might indeed contemplate an invasion wirhout
alarfti or apprehension ; he might fee with
the calmness of indifference our dwellings
burning, and might 44 laugh at our calami
ties and mock when our fears came upon us."
Were these or either of these the grounds of
that confidence which he i'eemed to feel and
of that security which he would inculcate, or
was it that he really believed that no invafioa
would be attempted I To give colour to his
opposition he had profefTed to take the latter
ground and had defended his position by the
assertion that it was not the interest, nor in
the power of the French to effect it. As to
the argument which took for its bafisthe mere
I calculation of interest, it would, Mt. Day
ton laid, have had some weight with him, it
the interest of the million was attended to in
France, orat this moment otherwise regarded
than as it might promote the ambition, the
power and avarice of those who hold the reins
of government. It was known that the great
mass of the people were not at all consulted,
nor even permitted to vote or adt except as
their rulers willedâlt was known that they
were ia fadt completely brought under milita
ry defpotilm ; and that the musket and bay
onet were the instruments and support of this
otherwise fhort-iived ufurpationâ*lt was
known that the Directory mult find employ
ment for their armies or that the armies would
find employment for the Directory, and that
their fafety consisted in their ridding them
selves in any way of at least forty or fifty
thousand of the molt restless, daring and am
bitious spirits. The interest ot the whole
people of France was therefore one thHng,and
that of those who governed was another very
different and opposite consideration. To
transport to other countries the men to whom
millions had been foler.inly promised at thÂ£
time of their and who might there
fore become importunate and dangerous A
home, would be the interest, and mu<t be thi*
wilh of the French Pentarchy t whose heads
would otherwise be made to ikip from their
shoulders. This would be their mtereft even
where there might be little prufpeCt of suc
cess for thetranfported army, because the ob
ject would be equally answered, whether they
Ihould succeed and provide for themfelvTs in
a foreign country or be vanquilhed and utter
ly dellroyed.
As to the power and the means of invafiotf,
it was known, Mr. Dayton said, that there
were already collected, upon the coasts of
France bordering upon the Englilh channel a
numerous army which in gasconading style
was called the Army of England. It was knowri
that there were alio collected and collecting
at the various ports in that quarter ships of
war and transports of all descriptions. The
fame soldiers who were prepared to Invade an
ifiand might certainly be employed upon the
Main, and the fame bayonets would pierce the
breasts of the people inhabiting the latter as
the former. Their larger transports, their
frigates, their larger ships cut down and arm
ed en flute, and their ships of the line might
transport a considerable part of them across
the Atlantic, and land them upou our shores,
and would very pofiibly be thus employed in
the event of a peace in Europe, or of their
abandoning from any cause whatever, their
project agaslift England. But the member
from Pennsylvania aware of the pollibility of
the attempt, had endeavoured to divert the
country from immediate preparation by the
afUirance that we fhotild have timely intelli
gence ot such a delign, if it should be con
templated, and her.* Mr. Dayton said lie en
tirely differed from that gentleman. As th<
fame men, arms, artillery, and military ftorÂ£s,
were calculated us well for the one expedition
as the other, and as there was a futficiency of
(hipping calculated for the navigation of the
Atlantic, it would follow that there would be
nothing in their preparations tn> evidence 3
change of purpose, and a design aga;n(t the
United States, but the additional quantity of
provilions (hipped in which it would not be
easy to detect them, or certainly not potfibje
to do it in season. He declared himfelf to he
ot opinion that there was other force befiJes
that in the Welt Indies which was capable of
invading this country, and other States, be
sides the two or three molt fouthcrn, againit
which that force might be directed.
As to the unconititutiona! y <&? the prin
ciple contained in this firft feet ion, as had heea
objected by its opponents, it was truly re
markable for the noviUy of theWhich, was now for the fir ft rime made by the â¢
enlightened members of;he jih Congrels.al- j
though not a feflion had palfed lince 17 9 1 in I
which il?e fame'had not been acted upon and j
fanCtioned. Mr. Dayton said, he recollected
perfectly well thatfix years ago, in the fern- |
0n0fi792, the faction which contains, thisve- (
ry principle in its broadest latitude was drawn ,
np and moved by a very respectable member
from the State of Virginia, one indeed of the
mod respectable of thofeAvhe had ever occu- j
pied a feat in that House, and who was a mem
ber of the Federal Convention. (Mr. Madi
fÂ«n). That gentleman had done him .the fa
vor to (hew him the proportion before it was
moved, and to a(k if he would give it his
support, which it received not only from him- !
felf but from the whole house. It thus be
came incorporated with the aC* parted in that
year, and that too without the lead fiiggelti
on from any member of its being unconflitu'i
ooul, either then or at any time since, altho'
it had been renewed in many of their laws.
Without remarking upon the accuracy or
elegance of" the expreflion of the eloquent
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brent} when
he spoke of Congress " cramming tin army
dvtun their fbroats" he (hoitld pass to another
which was exceptionable, not in the abstract,
but in the application which seemed to have
been intended by it, " slaves fight for hire,
but freemen for liberty" was the expreflion.
If it were at atf applicable to the bill before
them, it mud necelfariiy be applied also to
those, who were engaged for the fame term in
the (ervite of their country and contributed
to greatly tt> achieve its independence. Did
the gentleman mean "to brand with this appel
lation the men wlu had endured hunger, eold
and nakedness, and braved every danger in
the revolutionary war, merely, because they
were enlisted for a term of years, and received
pay j r their services t Would he call thole
slaves, who, at that crisis when thousands
shrunk from the conflict, pr.fented thtNr
breads jfld bayonets between him and dan
ger ! Wire they (laves who made-him what
he is, The Rcpreferitatme of an Independent
People, and to whom he is indebted tor the
privilege of speaking in these Councils ? It
â was a ieivtwiient which (hould be taken back,
and i reserved for other and fitter occasions,
where it would not be coftftrued as applying
to those meritorious men who had heretofore
projected him and iheir country, and whose
services might soon be wanted again.
He complained "of want ofcandourtn the
ice nber from Pennsylvania continuing to urge
the objection of uncbnftitutionality, -after lie
had himfelf admitted rhat it noiild be entire
ly removedby the amendment propo'edby the
Select Committee with a lingle alteration and
Â»fter tha't gentleman had by his own motion
to lirike out the whole lection, prevented
that amendment from being previoully made
in it.
Mr. Dayton conclud-d by faying that he
tailed on those gentlemen who veredefirous
of providing for the defence of this ctHintTy,
hereto make their (land, and to oppole unit
edly a motion so, fatal to its interests and lafe
tyâHe invited them to unite with him in de
fending inch by inch the important provisions
of this bill in all its parts, and only to yield as
Compelled by .numbers compoling a majority
against them.
Mr. Brent allured the gentleman lad up
thai he had given a very improper explanati r
onto words which he had uttered- If he had
jnade use of any expreflion that could be con
flniediato a reflection upon' the brave army
who fought in our revolutionary war, he
would not hesitate a moment to retract it, be
catife he was delrrous of giving to that patri
otic band every praise wTiich they deserved.
The gentleman from New-Jerley was also in
accurate in ascribing the expreflion to him.â
It was firft used by the gentleman from North
Carolina (Mr. R. Williams) whenremark
ing upon what had fallen from the gentleman
from Maryland (Mr. S. Smith) heobferved
that the people oÂ£.tbe United States are free,
and so long as they continue to enjoy the
bleflings of a good government, they would
be equal to the repelling of any attack which j
may be made against them, and he used the j
expreflion which~he (Mr. B.) afterwards ;
Quoted, when replying to some comments :
which had bÂ«en made upon it by the gent'e- 1
man from Maryland. He thought the gen
tleman from North-Carolina was correct in
his idea ; he believed the militia of this coun
try fought for jiobler conlideritions than mo-
H-y_:they fi o ht for liberty and independence.
'â¢ Mr. R.. Williams (aid, the gentleman
from New-Jersey had given his words a con
frruction which would offend every man in
the United Stales. He had made ule of the j
expreflion to enforce his idea of the pretera- j
blenefs of the militia over a ltandingar.my.for
-the' defence of the country; of men who
fought in defence of the blelfings they enjoy
ed, over those who fought merely for hire, j
ile couli} not fee how the gentleman from N.
Jerfev could have underftqod it in the way in
â which he had dated it.
With reipect to any thing which the gen
tleman had laid wyh respect to the oppolition
which had been (hewn to this bill., it would
not deter him from acting as he thought be(t
â¢would serve the interests of his country. He
did not himfelf wtfh to dictate to any man
how he ought to aCI, nor did he wish to be
dictated to. All had the fame interest, he
supposed, to lupport, and if they differed a
bout the means of effecting it, it ought not be
charged against them as a crime. He won
dered, therefore, when gentlemen Could not
compel others to think with them, that they
should think it neceflary toabufethem. Stich
conduct wenttodedroy the freedom ot debate.
Tf members are not to beat liberty tocompare
their thoughts without having illiberal mo
tives ascribed to them, harmony and good or
der could not be expected to fubliff -amongst
them. He lived in a remote part of the coun
try, but he believed, in time of danger, nei
ther he nor the people who lent him, would
Call upcm the mountains to hide them, as the
gentleman from New-Jersey had insinuated.
They had never (hewn that difpofitiom
But the gentleman from New-Jerfey,.on
this and former occasions, chafes to. single
out a particular character in that House for
his levered censure. He did not know why
he should do this ; if there was any blame to
lie imputed to any man for opposing this bill,
he (hould wish to have his (hare of it, in the
way in which it waÂ«.ufual for that gentleman
to bedow itâa way which he, however,
thought unwarrantable.
A motion was made for the committee to
rife, and negatived.
Mr. S. Smith said, did he think with the
Speaker, that this question was the touchstone
by which to determe whether members were
willing to defend their country or not, he
flioitld wave his opinion and vote with him.
From the receipt of the la(t dispatches from
Franct, he had made up his mind to go into
ciTantial measures for the defence of the coun
try, but not to go into any thing which he
did not think eflential; and if he differed from
the gentleman from New- Jersey on thisquef
tior., lie rrufted he would not impute that
difference to a determination not to defend his
eountry.
Mr. S. said, he never did conCder this as
â  â  J- - , .- -jv .
m eifential bittf "isn't he agrfeedtoialce it with
lie amendments proposed by the select com- d
tiittee. When he did this, however, it was F
tpon the idea that gentlemen Who were deli- n
ous ot .voting for measures of defence would o
illo have voted for raifingmoiiey to paynhem. Â»
Jpon this view, though contrary to his fen- n
iments, lie promiled his support to the bill.
The question which was decided on Mun- r
lay (the question determining whether the "
aud-tax (hould be for one year or annual) \ t*
was that which ought to have been a rallying r
point. It was then gentlemen threw from r
them the (trongelt defence, when they 1
leclared they would not tax themselves more
than one year for the defence of their liberties 3
ind independenceâand sot now upon a quef- v
tion of raising a body of 10,000 men, which r
would scarcely serve for an advance-jjuard.
Money was the thing warned'. There had not <
been a single object of defence which he had 1
not voted for ; and he had been the means of '
bringing forward the touchstone with respeCt '
to paying the expence; and what was the- '
:onfequencef The question for making the
land-tax annual was lo(t, 6o to Â»o, so that the *
tax was only to be laid tor one year, which . c
would produce two millions of dollars a year j a
hence. Was not this weakness itfelf) He â¢) c
thought it was. What was meant bycharg- . e
:s brought against geutlmen of being unwtll- 1
ng to defend their countery ! No one could '
renoufly believe for one moment any (uch ; â¢
thing. Gentlemen, may talk ofraifing men as (
much as they pleaseâThey can be got when- i c
vef they are wanted. Money was the thing 1
wanted, and not io.ooomen, whom lie could ]
'aile in one half of his own d.itnct, in fhree J
lays notice. Besides, Bo,woo men were helcl '
n readiness, and might be called out in whole ;
ir in part, at anytime. Indend, (incegen- '
Ictiien who are (o loud in f peaking of defen- â¢
ive measures, have oppolcd the railing of '
noney, lie could Scarcely conlider them in '
?arne(t. I *
Mr. S. said he did not mean to go at length I '
nto this (object; heonly wilhed toconvtnce t <
the Speaker that.persons might beoppofedto i '
rliis bill without beingoppofed to the taking â  '
jt meafuresforthe drfence of the country. j '
Mr. Daictpk wifhed-. the gentleman from i '
Maryland to answer one or two things. If i 1
io.ooo men could only be conlidered as an 1
advance-guard, why was he'fo anxiotii to re- 1
duce the irutnber from 2o,ooc?to 10,000, and *
urge huh (Mr. D.) to to the reduction f â¢ 1
1 hiUgeiitu*Hund:dthij,fpokeofaâ¬ompromife I
which had taken place in the select commit- 1
tee, and that if he (Mr. D.) would support [
it, the bill would pals withoutoppofition. Is '
it not extraordinary, that after this, he (hould
â¢ iow be leelured by tliat gentleman, and that
he himfelf (huuldnow be found opposing the 1
compromise which he hadbei'ore recommen- '
ded ? He thought it was. â¢ '
Mr. S. Smith fait}, he had noidcaoflec- '
turing the Speaker. He was making an apo- 1
logy for his own vote. Mr. S. said, he was '
alked why he wilhed to reduce the 20,00 a men 1
toip,ooof He neverpropoled any fuchthmg. '
It was a compromise offered to him by the
Chairman of the committee, and of the two '
evils he chose the least, though he did not j
think the jne 11 neceirary. But since gentle- 1
men had declined to vote for the necelfary '
money to support the expence, he thought i
himfelf excufed.lrom voting for these men at '
all. Whenever tile time comes for defend- '
ing the country, he had no dpubt about find
ing men enough: He knew ot.no difaffected
or feditiotis persons of whom certain gentle
men feem,ed so much afraid. . He knew of no
American who could pot be trujipd; and if
the militia had arms putjiwo their hands they"
would be equal to the reperting of any preda- j
tory attack. Should war take place, he should !
then be in favour of a regular army ; and if j
war (hould not take plac , then tlje expence i
of railing tile army would be laved. [
Mr. f in dle y w' flied m mention one fait. ;
The gentleman from New-Jersey had made
an ungenerous and unfounded insinuation as
to the want of fptritof the people in the coun
try from whence lie and his colleague (Mr.
Gallatin) came, by faying that he supposed
that gentleman would go to his retreat 011 the
Monongaheh, and call upon the mountains
to hide him. Does experience juftify the re-,j
flection ? He did not live in that part of the
country during the war; but he recollected
that there were two regiments of men from
Wcfttnoreland who fought bravely in New-
Jersey.
Mr. Sewall rose to explain the business
relative to the compromise which General i
Smith had mentioned, but- was prevented by 5
a call to order, and by the interference of the :
Chair,
Mr. Ltos said, he (hould not have risen ;
at thi" late hour, had not the gentleman from
New-Jersey called to his mind some argu
ments againlt this bill. In the firft place, that
gentleman told the committee that the '
have got a band of l'oldiers which they 40, ;
not know what to do with. Mr. L. wilhed to
keep this country out of a limilar situation,
and therefore he was oppoled to this bill.â
Another reason, the gentleman fays this force
is now neceirary. [Mr. Dayton said, nofuch
thing had fallen trom him.] Mr. L. laid he
so underltood him, that from the present situ
ation of things 111 1-ranee, and particularly of
the army of England, and of the vell'els pre
paring to traniport them, that it was now ne
celfary to raise these men, and that the Pre
sident would think it necelfary. Mr. L. had ,
no doubt the Prelident did think 10, and he'!
was not willing that he lliouid Have an oppor
tunity of earring his wilhes into effect: He
, supposed gentlemen were aware that they â¢
cdtild not at present prevail with the House
to raise an army, and they therefore take this
way of putting it in the President's power to
raise it, without their confcnt."
I The question for striking out the firft fec
| tion was put and negatived 47 to 44.
The committee rose and h.td leave to fit
again. Adjourned.
Friday, May it.
Mr. A. Foster prelented an address from
Portsmouth, N. H. approbatory of the con
duct of the Executive, and exprellive of de

These addrelfes were severally referred to

The bill for the relief of William Imlay,
was read the third time and passed.
Mr. H arpfr,-(VoÂ«i the committee of ways

which was twice read and committed.
Mr. Pinckney asked and obtained leave
of absence for the remainder of the feflion, on
the ground of his family concerns requiring
his attendance at home.
Mr. Harper, after premising that he ttn
derftood many ot' our sailors were differing in
Foreign Ports for want of the means of retur
ninghome, fromiiavingbeencaptureelonboard
our vefTels, moved the following Refohnion,
which was agiecd to, and a committee of three
members appointed to'carry it into effjdt.
" Rtfolved that a committee he appointed to enquire and

On motion of Mr. Sewall, the house ,
again resolved itfelf into a committee ot the
whole on the bill authorizing the Prclident to
raise a Provisional Army ; when
Mr. Dawson rose, and moved to strike out
that part of the amendment of the select com
mittee, which is in the following words:
â¢ 44 imminent danger of such innjajion, difcvvcred
in his opin '-on, to exijt." He said.he would ftatc
_ his reasons.Â£or making this motion.
That the fitnation of the United States, at
this time., said Mr. D- is extremely awful and j
delicate, is acknowledged by all ; and he |
j agreed in the sentiment which had been so
often ex pretfed, that C.ongrels to ad9.pt
, every meafttre tor our security which exist
; ing circumfbocesmay req,uire a;Â»d our cohfti
-1 j tution authoriie, whether we may have been
; . brought into that situation by the aggrelfidtts
i ' of other or by the policy of our
,"j ownadmihiftration. Some, he knew, there are
who.are persuaded that eve;y aÂ£t of ajur Go
| vernment towards foreign nations, has been
jwft and impartial ; othens there are who
L think that we may have committed errors,
and that we ought, on conviction, to redress
them. Some there are who attribute the con
duct of the French Republic towards us to a
fiippoie division in our puhlic councils, and
k between the people ahd their government ;
j whilil others are apprehensive that intempe
{ j rate, acrimonious language, and inflated de
. , clamation, oh our part, may have irritated a
, j Nation, in her viftory and giddy with
â  I success. Whether to or to which ot these
j several causes we are to attribute our present
l | situation, Mr. D. said he would not enquire,
f } and (hould think it wife to keep out of view,
j .as far queftions which have so
much agitated the Union, and divided her
[ councils ; he was of opinion that all parties
.. thould unite their endeavours to avert the im
Â» pending dorm, and ft they cannot do it, they
' Ihould be prepared-to meet it like tnen relolv
t to support theconftitution, the liberty and
s independence of their country.
[ These being sentiments ,and principles to
t which he was forever wedded, he must ex
. press his aftonidiment at insinuations which
" had been so often heard within those walls,
, from gentlemen elated in their own estimation,
who are constantly plaping feathers in tbeir
own caps, and ascribing to others who differ
s from them in opinion, at lealt an indifference
to the interests of their country. With what
delicacy these charges had been made, he left
1 with the gentlemeh tbemfelves to determine,
\ with what propriety they had been urged, an
t impartial pubLic will decide. XoUpat tribunal
he chearfully appealed; and he Felt a confi
â  dence, that if by the aggressions of other
t governments, or the policy of our own, our
t country Ihould be involved in war, the gen
tleman with whom he had the honour to a^t,
[ Vi ould be found as ready to meet danger, and
j as firm in fupporti/ig the liberty and inde
pendence of as their Vaunting,
j opponents.
f With ftlefe impreffiorts uport his mind, he
fh'ould readily vote in favour of the bill under
_ confideratioH, however largeÂ» the number of
J j men, or great the expence, could
\ himfelf that exiffing cifcumftances require the
e j adoption of the'meafure, or that theconftitu
| tion would authoytfe the delegation of power.
} 3ut, believing a* .he did> that there are no
" dangers whicli at this time threaten our coun
j rry, which may hot be met by the Militia of
it, and as.he was that the conffttu
tion does : not atidiorize the propdftd delega*

On a review of'the subject before the com
. mittee, two, and. only two points present
* themielves toour enquiry, aud tfvefe have been
Z\ so fully treated.by gentlemen who had preced-
J edftiui in the debate (especially by the able
1 member from Pennfylvani'a, Mr. (Gallatin,
and his ve r y eloquent colleague, Mr. Brent)
that anattempt on his part to enforce their ar
, gumefits, would be adding sophistry for
I foning, and declamation for perfualion. He
( would, therefore, fit down with moving his
J ; amendment.
j A call for the question was made,
j Mr.Sewall would only observe, t4iat this
' question was the fame which had been debat
-1 ed for several days. He left the public to
j judge of the candour of gentlemen in thus re-
j peatintr questions upon the committee. If the
bill was to produce any effedt at all, it must !
' â¢ have its principal effect from those words. !
0 As to ih" constitutional scruple, he believed
e motion did not prevail (which he trusted it
h would not) he ihould move to confine the
c power proposed to be given to the Preiident,
to the recess of Congress; and if imminent
~r danger Ihould exist in the meantime, the Pre
sident certainly ought to nave the power to
begin to raise these men.
The question was put and negatived 48
a to 41.
-j Mr. Sewall then moved the following
e wordsto be introduced into the committee's
* amendment, viz. " before the next feffton of
t Congress, 'â which is orfball be appointed by law.' 1
y This motion, after a number of obfervati

was agreed to, in these words before the nezt

PHIL A DELPHI A,
SATURDAY EVENING,Mat t6.
CONG.R ESS.
Ycfterday, the HoÂ»fÂ« of Reprefentitives of the
United States, were employed, principally in dis
cussing a bill providing for the relief of persons im
priforted for debts tlue to the United States, which
was finally agreed to. It provides far releasing
persons imprilonCd upon execution ifiTuing from any
court, of the United States, far any debt due
tu the United States, on..their latisfa&orily prov
ing that they are unable to pay the debt for
which they are imprisoned, and that they havp not j
concealed or made any improper conveyance of their j
property. A motion was made by Mr. Harper, !
to, include in this provision persons confined on mefne ,
procefa, previous to jiidgment, which occasioned
confideral/le debate, and which in the committee of j
the whole, was only negatived by one vote, viz. 5*
to 31 ; but which, on being renewed in the house,
was negatived 48 to 29.
A little before three o'clock, Vr. Sewall, from
the committee for the prote&ion of commerce and
the defencf of the country, repoftcd it a* the opinion
of that com '.ittee that the house ought to concur in
the bill from the Senate for the more effe&ual pro- ,
te&ion of the commerce and coasts of the United '
States. The report was twice read, and the biU
was ordered to be committed to a committee of the
whole. On the Speaker's \ utting the usual ques
tion, " For what day Jhall it be made the order?" Mon
dly, to-morrow and to-day were named. The >
question 00 Monday was put aud jiegatived 43 to !
37. Itoe Speaker was about to put the question on. j
Saturday (this day) when it was opposed by Messrs. i
Sewall and J. Williams, on the ground Â©f the ;
present situation of things calling for immediate de
cision, and fluting that it wa< proper the bill (hould j
be immediately agreed to; and it was advocated by ;
Messrs. Gallatin, M'Dowell, Macon, Brent and Ly
on, who desired, that as the hour of adjpuramcnt
was arrived, this question which went to place the
country in a state of war, would not then be insisted
upon, but that they might 'at least have one day to
consider of it. Mr. Sewall at length withdrew his
motion, and the bill was made the order for this day.
FOR THE GAZETTE OF THE VNItED STATES.
Muck debate might be spared in Congress, if
it were easy, at once, to dcte& and expose the

There it a man in the public councils, by uature
largely gifted ; by education rich in literary at
tainments ; by habit, free from all the pertur
bations of pafTion; and, by inclination, not
disposed io those plsafures of conviviality, and
the tableÂ»whichfuipend and diflipatethe thoughts
from inttnfe application to business. A man of
this cast, though he may not, " be fit for trea
foqi, ltrawgerui and spoils," may yet '* perplex
and dÂ»lh nutureit counsels," and â¢â¢ make the
bad appear the better cause" with a luminous
conception of his objeil, never obfeuredby em*
baYaflmeiit in the dtlivery of it, and always pre
pared by a profound knowledge 0/ the fubjeft,
which he is able to enforce by all the power of
words, and to defend with the fame weapons,
what mighty mifchtef may not such a man ef
fect" (if hia heart bi vicious) in a free popular as-
Jembly? and what abilities mull his ddverfaries
pofltfti, promptly, to refute and filencc him ?
Di&cult as this may be on the spur of the occa
iion, it is less so, when wc contemplate his ar
guments in the ciofct. The main one on which
he relics, or his whole reasoning falls to the
ground, is, that it is in the option of the United
; States, so far as our affairs relate to France, to
have peace or war; and, that, though America
| has cause of war, juitifiable caufc of war, yet,
;as war not declared, war is not yet produced,
reau the fpeeeh of Mr. Gallatin the aoth of
| April in answer to Mr. Allen and Mr. Dana and
yom will find he is irot mifreprelented by me ;
the words in Italics are extraded from it ;
44 whether the power of granting convoys ftiould
be retrained in time of peace" 44 that a war
will be more prejudicial to commerce" &c. &c.
44 all these prove that his ailumption is, that
there is peaceâfir, arguments however ingenious
have ho power over fads, to iatfs then let us
appeal. France wages war againjl the United
States, is at war with themâhas produced war y
to use hia own wordsâcan any man of sobriety
and truth deny this ? The fame measure of hos
tility fiie has meted to us, it is proposed to mete
to her, and this without any declaration of war.
But, if we do this, fays Mr. Gallatin, we lhall
44 produce war"âin the name of heaven is it
noc already produced ? And so far from its be
ing in our option to eflgage in, or declare war j
it is well known, that every effort we have
made to heal our differences, and to ward off
this dreadful calamity his been attended with no
| other confequvnce, than to increase the temper
I of hofti.ity, and to strengthen oui enemy in
: the determination to multiply injuries ; ih
pioportion, as we mani.clted a spirit of pa
tience and forbearance, they have robbed and
inlulted us âdoes the gentleman mean that the
fame degree flf hoitilicy toward us from France
is not war, that would be if dealt by us to
France ? Surely a reprel'entative of the people
in the giand council,of the nation will not have
the hardihood to avow this ? and yet, this is the!
fair result if his realonmg. I defy him, or any !
man to extricate him from thiÂ» dilemma ; either
that France is at war with us, has produced war;
or that our defence of ourl.elves, both by laud
and water, not exceeding in its mode and mea
sure the hoftiliry that has been waged against us,
will not be war To fuppole a declaration of
war, (which is only a ceremonial) adds to, or ;
diminilhes the extremity of the evils of war* |
is one of the molt pilpabie absurdities that a <
novice in politics can entertain, and therefore j
never entertained by Mr. Gallatin. The war
which began in 1778 between France and Great
Britain and ended in 1 jB3, a war of five years
continuance was newer declared. r J he war be
tween Frederic the. third of fruffn, andjofeph
the emperor of Germany concerning the ex
change of Bavaria for the Aultrian Netherlands,
was 4 if I remember accurately* declared, both
parties greW wife, made peace and not a battle
wa* tought,â how idle then to cavil about a decla
ration of war ? America is now driven on this
ultimatum, fhc must defend herl'clf (be thecon
ftqutnees what they may) by all the energies
at>d faculties of purse and persons ; or, she
mult resign that ltation, which she claimed:,
vindicated an<} arrived at among the nations ol
tlÂ« earth, INDEFENDKNCVâThis is her
only option ; and what elcdlion theMrne sons of
America will make admits of little doubt : II
opposition tell you, peace is attainable, they
deceive you ; your wUe> your prudent Pieli
dent with unexampled patience, has temporifed
has waited events ; has been bind to mfulta and
to injuries ; all these have been submitted to, in
(1k hope of til difference?, anl
keeping the United States in peace ; his endeav
or, have proved fruitless : it it the duty now of
all virtuous citizens to look our Gtuation in the
face with fortitude, and as we have llready
displayed our magnanimity in ihe mattery of
our pafiioss, prove in the sequel our firmnefs by
the manly, but temperate conrlinft ot our
RESENTMENT.
M*. Fenno,
Will you pleife to publish the following
quotation from the convcrfatioa of Mr. Y.
with oor Miniften in France, as an intro
duction to the remarks of i
A Correspondent.
" Yoti ought to know that the diplsma
tic (kill of France, and the means (he pos
sesses frt your country, are fufficieut to enable
her, with the French party in America, to
i throw the blame of the rupture of the nego
' ciation? on the Federalists, as you t*rra
â  yourselves, but on the Pritiflv party, as
, France terms you ; and you may assure your
selves this will be done."
Let us examine how far this opinion if
jultified by the sentiments of Mr. Gallatin,
delivered irÂ» Congress. Mr. Gallatin has
j declared that " France has given us just
! cause Â®f war ; but if Congress do not thinly
proper to go to war, they ought not to .
grant the "armed vcffels as convoys, which <
would be in fatt war." He adds, " the
queftio > is, whither we (hall bear with the
losses which mufl result from capture, or
| refill them with force and war ?" Is i not
; evident that it was Mr. Gallatin's intention,
! by this mode of expreflion, to throw the
j odium entirely upon the Americans, if a
I war defenfive upon our part should be found
| expedient. While the Corf airs of France
take our unarmed vessels, and abiife our citi- â¢
zens, he docs aot fay France makes war up
on our commerce. But if ylmcriccns rcfifi
those who endeavour to talc away their pro
perty, " if armed vejfeh are granted as convoy t,
â  " this iÂ« in fa& war." Mr. Gallatin has
too much underflanding h'imfelf to think,
what he vould wish his words to make
others believe. He knows well, that unlcfe
our eonvoys are attacked, in faS it mill no! be
war. War is commenced by the nation
which attacks. Our armed vcffels are to
defend, not to attack. It is not our view
unjuflly-to invade the property of others,
I but to defend our own. The means of de
fence are not war, a'id it is an insult spon
! the public to imagine that Mr. Gallatin
j can thus deceive them. But the truth as it ap
! pears to me, is thai Mr. Gallatin has an ardent
wilh that the Freneh should have as much
American property as poflible, on the most
easy terms, and that they should deprive uÂ»
of the sources of resistance, before we art
allowed to make an effort to refill, j He
would throw the odium upon those who
refill, and uot upon those who make an un
| just attack. He would throw the blame
which will attend the rupture of the nego
ciations, and going to war, upon the Fede
rslills, who love their country, and will not
give up its. interest to any other. My coun
trymen, do you not think that men pof
fefling the fentimeiits of Mr. Gallatin, are
such as Mr. Y. terms the French party, and
that upon such men France depends for
fuecefs againjl us ?

Sir,
DEEPLY impressed with the alarming
crisis to which the political relations of our
country have arrived, and believing it im
portant and ncceffary at theprefent junflure,
that our government, as well as foreign na

WE the Inhabitants of the Town of Fay
etteville, cannot forbear teflifying our full
approbation of your admiuiftratiofl, and our
entire confidence in your wifdom,-integrity,

We conceive this declaration more imme
diately necessary, when we are sensible that
attempts have been siade to represent us as
a divided people, and opposed to the measures
of our government. This Sir, is not the
eharafterof Americans. Convince l os the
impartiality of our Governmcni, in itstranf
aftions with all nations, and grateful for the
happinels and prefperity we havj: enjoyed
under it, we come-forward unequivocally to
declare to the world, that we will support
with ouf livÂ«s and property, the Conflitu
tion, the Government, and the Jndepen
dence of our country, agaiifl the arro
gance and inimical views of France, or any
foreign nation whatever.
While we fervently pray that IÂ® calami
ties of war may not again desolate our coun
try, and that we mav still continue to enjoy
the bleflings of peace We cannot too
highly approve of the meafurcs which have
.been taken to place our country in a torn
piete (late of Ttefence; which under a firm
reliance on Divine Providence, and the jus
tice of our caule, will, we trull, enable U8
to bid defiauce to the attacksofevery foreign

tion, when oiir coasts ai"e threatened to be
ravaged, well may we feel a coftfiderable de
gree of alarÂ® at our defeneelefs situation.
A prayer, it is said, will be this week
forwarded from this city to the General Af
ftrmbly, that our harbour may immediately
be put in a "proper (late of defence. The
expente would not be very eonfiderable, and
it ishighlyprobable the debt incurred would
be assumed by the United States.
The security of tliis port is not only of
mpoVtance to the merchants of New-Len
don and Norwich, but to all others through-'
out the (late ; asin the eourfeof a year nine
tenths of the (hipping ,anchor here.'And the
truth cannot be concealed that at present
the smallest armed veflcl migbtcut Ihips from
their moorings (as at Charlefton)aud carry
them off with fafcty.
Thefignsofthe timesarealarming: dreams
of security will not protest us; If we expedt
protection from the militia, encouragement
most be given to those who ilo the duty ;
and the number of exempts mull be lessen
ed.âA million of liollars haÂ»e been given
by the (late for the fupportof Churches and
Schools : the belief purpafes. But our Le
gislators must do more ; the vineyard is plan
ted, and the wall to protest the frfrit left
proflrate. What will become of our beau
tiful fabric of morality and science,. reared
with so much care and expenee, when a fe
rocious and unprincipled enemy has rifled
us of our property, and independence ?
