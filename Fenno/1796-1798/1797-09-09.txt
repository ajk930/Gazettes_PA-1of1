altogether. " Never; fays that paper, can one na

No Editor could, without encountering the in

of the community, attempt to " palliate the inju

as relates to Great Britain, it may fafely be denied
that it ever was done by any American Editor. A
keen sense of the indignities offered to this country
by Britain, was tarly evinced in the Gazette of the
United Statesâtheir outrages were reprobated ia
as loud a tone as the occasion demanded. But the

FVatn a ViÃd I*l A Paver. \
Amongst Mr. Clay'srea&ns why h* thinks {
that fomc tif our countrymen wilh " all jsow- \
er to centre in the Hands of one person" he i
states that certain members of Congress were r
of opinion that they had no right to advise e
the Executive as to the grounds of negoci- {
ation with Francfc ; that they proposed an 1
addition of 992 men to our artillery an in
eretife and completion of our little navy, and 1
an augmentation of our military eftablilh- t
ftlerltâGood God ! what rtafons are these, t
and particularly at this time to prove that t
despotism is about to be introduced ! Mr. I
Clay, and some others were opposed to these :
things, and as an apology to his constituents 1
tells them, and attempts to alarrti thefti too, 1
that these things were all for the ptirpofeof
centering " all poorer in the hands of one I
person." Will his eonftituents receive it as i
atl apology ? or have they a right to expeft I
of Mr. Clay that he support that govern- 1
ment which We have formed freely ; to en- I
title him to their'approbation longer ? Let 1
us examine the opinions of these meinbeiVof
Congress so reprobated by Mr. Clay, and
fee how they will {landâ By the conftituti- 1
on " he President shall have power by and 1
with the advice and consent of the Senate
to make treaties, provided two thirds of the 1
Senators present concur : and he (hall nomi- :
nate, and by and with thead*ieeand consent
of the Senate (hall appoint Ambassadors"
See. Sac. The President and Senate being <
thui empowered through their ambassadors
to negociate and make treaties are responsible
for any hreach of the trust thus reposed in
themj and may be impeached and punilhed. 1
The responsibility and powers are infeperably ;
annexed by the constitution ; thus the <
Judge is answerable for his condudt in jud
ging, the legislator in lawgiving and the ex
ecutive in performing thÂ« duties of their de
partment, in making treaties, &c. Take
â¢ away the responsibility and you had better
take away the power. The Congress of
the Utiitid States then advising the Execu
tive what kind of a treaty to make with
France, evidently takes away the responsibi
lity and the executive is not acccountable
for any consequences : this i* not authori
zed by our constitution and is a direct at
tempt of the legiflatire to eneroach an one
branch of eur Government " to centre in
the hands of a few"which Mr. Clayio loud
ly complains ofin others whileheispurfuing
the direst road to the attainment of it him
felf. The impropriety of Congress advising
the Executive to make this of that treaty is
manifeft on the score of information : The [
! President has ambassadors in all the different
states and kingdoms with whiâ¬h we have
conneftion, their duty is to make enquiry,
and fee 9nd examine into, particularly, the
conduit of the nation where each resides, to
know the principles which govern their
councils towards us, to know their situation,
strength, commerce, demands, what suit*
them snd is convenient to us &c. See. and
to give private information of all these to
the ExecutiveâWith this certain and au
thentic information ; it not the executive
better qualified to make a treaty than any
other department of Government ?
Is not the Executive thus informed, bet
ter qualified than the house of representa
tives, whose information is collected from
vague report*, news-papera retailing falfities
and contradiÂ£lionÂ«, and other fourcts equally
as uncertain .' Upon the score of preserv
ing the constitution inviolate, found policy
and the probability of treaties being made,
better consulting our true interests, I con
clude that Congress had no more right to
advise the executive what kind of a treaty j
to make than the judiciary have our state
legifiatures, or aÂ«y other body of men not
impowcred by the constitution.

1 The fubjedl of the following obfervati

A NATIVE AMERICAN.
( Continued from a former paper.)
I SHALL premise, as a general rule
equally affefting all, that five things must
concur to qualify any man to vote at an
. ele&ion. An ele&or must be I ft, a free
man ; 2d, a citizen ; 3d, of the age of
. twenty-one years or upwards ; 4th, he
; njuft have resided in the state two years
| next before the eleftion ; and Jth, he mult,
j within that time, have paid taxes, assessed
' at least fix months before the ele&ion. The
j want of any one of these difqualifies from
, voting, except as to the last, in a cafe which
, I shall hereafter mention.
I. Natives to be entitled to votÂ», must
be of the age of twenty-one yeare or up
wards ;â¢ their ordinary pi 3" rtlidsnce, o
for two years next beiore the electioii, at ; f
which they offer their votes, mull have been p
in this state ; and within thai-time, they t
mult have paid a state or county tax, assess- a
ed at lead fix months before the eleftion. e
Gee conflitution of Penrifyfvania, art. 33, 1
feftion 1 ft. '
11. Emigrants.into this state, if thiv t
have before been citizens of any other of t
the United States, are, of course, citizens 1
of this state ; but still they are not entitled i
to vote, unless they have reflded in this
state two years next before the eleftion, ;
and, within that time, paid a state or coun- <
ty tax, assessed at least fix months before 1
the eleftion, ib. and art. of confed. 4.
111. Emigrants from foreign states must
have rcfided in this state two years next be- 1
fore the eleftion, and, within that time, 1
have paid a state o? cOUnty tax, assessed at 1
least fix* months before the eleftiott ; and
still they are not entitled td vote unless they ]
have been naturalized, of become citizens.
Ibid.
To afcertdin Whether a foreigner has been
naturalized, or become a citizen or not,
the following enquiries must be made : 1 ft,
was he a citizen of this state, or any other
of the United States, at the time of the
adoption of the constitution of the United
States, or at any time before the 26th of
March, 1790. If he' Was, he remaifis a
citizen. But if he was not, it must then
be enquired, 2d, has he on, or since the
26th of March, 1790} and before the 29th
January, 179;, been riaturali/ed, or be
come a citizen of the United States, agree
ably to the direftion3 of the aft of congress
of 26th March, 1790. If he has, he re
mains a citizen. But if he has not, it
must be enquired, 3d, has he, on or since
the 29th January, 1795, been naturalized
or becorrie a citizen of the United States,
agreeably to the direftions of the aft of
cangrÂ«fÂ» of 29th of January, 1795. If
he was, he remains a citizen. ;
To explain this I must trace the pro
gress of our natural it at ion laws. The for
mer constitution of Pennsylvania declared,
that every foreigner of good charaftef, who
comes to fettle in this state, havin'g firft
taken an oath of allegiance to the fame,
and after one year's residence, shall be deem
ed a free denizen thereof, feftion 42. By
an aft of assembly 13th September, 1795,
it was declared, that no stranger from fo
reign parts, who has come into this state,
; although he have resided therein one full
| year, shall be admitted to vote at sn elefti
op, unless he produce to the infpeftor a
certificate of his having taken an oath of
allegiance, feftion zi. ,â >
The constitution of the United States
gave to congress power to establish an uni
form rule of naturalization, art. 1, feft. 8.
This power congress did not exercise till
6th March, 1790, when they authorised
any common law court of record, to admit
aliens to become citizens. From that time,
all laws of any state, refpefting the admis
sion of aliens to becorrfe citizens, ccafed,;
and aliens could be admitted only nctcrd
ing to the direftibns of the law of congress.
On 29th January, I79s,"rtmgrcfs repealed
this law and enafted another authorising the
supreme, superior, diftrift, or circuit court
of some one of the states, or of . the terri
tories north-weft, or south of the river
, Ohio, or a circuit or diftrift tourt of the
United States, to admit aliens to become
citizens. And ever since that law, 110 alien
can be admitted a citizen but according to
its directions.
I The proof that one who .was an alien,
has become a citizen to be given to entitle
him to vote, is a certificate by the magis
trate, before whom the oath of allegiance
to Pennsylvania was taken, before the 6th
March, 1790, or of the court before whom
the alien was admitted as a citizen, since
that time. If that certificate of the ma
gistrate be loft," the best way to supply it
would be to obtain another, and if that
cannot be done, it must be, like all other
, loft proof, supplied by oath. Aft of as
. fembly September 13th, 1785, fee. 21.
. Alien children of aliens, minors at the time
. of the naturalization of their fathers, be
. come thereby citixensâ-aft of congress 6th
. March, 1790, and 29th January, 1795.
Not having paid taxes is no difqualifica
. tion of a person legally exempted from
: taxes, nor of the son of a qualified pei lon,
, if this son be above twenty-one, and under
1 twenty-two years of ageâPenn. const. art.
- 3, fee. Iâaft1 âaft of assembly, 25th Septem
[ ber, 1786, fee. 6. And evidence of age,
: residence and payment of taxes, &c. may
- be (riven by oathâ aft of 13th September,
F 1785, fee. 23.
. No eleftor can give m his vote but at
1 the diftrift, and to the infpeftor for the
j township in which he livesâaft of 13th
r September, 1785, fee. 13.
Such is, I think, a faithful statement of
. the qualifications of eleftors, as prescribed
. by our laws : for the due execution of
which our eleftion officers are sworn, and
for any deviation from which, they are lia
-1 ble to prosecution and punilhment. I con
sider their faithful execution as necessary to
preserve the purity of our government.

1 "O my country ! are you free !" " This
â  is the question which every woTthy man puts
: to himfelf, in running over this foil still wet
: with the blood of its tnoft virtuous inhabi
-1 tants ; this country, where the wrecks of
, the most elegant monuments of human art
! lie? scattered by the fide or dead bodies; this
France, fo peopled, so magnificent,
1 to-day, changed into 1 desert, and covered
with the crape of tombs. Omy country !
Liberty, that objeft of thy love and firft
facrifices, has (lie been the price of the
scourges, which some monsters have heaped
on thy Surface i tf me, are â  yoii' i d
J All fs silent ; and the'deplorable or- f
phang of a mortally* wciundtd nation, with r
thrineyes turned towards heaven, appear to ]
afli : u When then will a man arise fuffici- t
ently couragiou3 to paint the secret and pub- t
lie of our tyrants, to trahfmit to fu- t
tnfe ages the lesson of our thisfottJunes, and i
to console the shades of our murdered fa- 1
thers, by exposing to the execration of th,e t
universe the fiend-like deformity 6f their as- 1
faffifls." t
" Well, this m4n (hall be me. For three i
years past I have panted to enjoy the liberty 1
of the press. In the midst of the inunda- I
tion of all forts of vices, let us ofFer an afy- I
lum to the virtues indignant ; let; us fee <
whether the liberty of the press has loft no- ]
thing ) and if the laaguagi of truth can I
make l'tfelf heard without obstacle. If it i
terrifies only the guilty, '.hen will I speak ; !
those who govern wish the happiness of the '
peopleâthey cannot be offended at what I
shall fay." " By what fatality has it happen
ed that this people were at the mercy of a
horde of robbers ? What have they done
to merit this fhameful destiny ? Is it neceffa
ry'that a revolution should partake of the
horrors of a vulcano or an earthquake ? Bit
if the calm appears, ought we not to exa
mine the losses we have sustained, to count
the victims, and to give to each of them the
tribute of regret it merits ? We have seen
monsters on the throne ; we have seen the
fenateof Rome disgorge the Appius's ; but
what we had never seen till this enlightened
age, what we will never fee again, is the
genius of crime convoking all the wicked
vile monsters disseminated in the croud of
an immense nation, attaching them the one
to the other, confounding together all the
elements of depravity, all the amalgamation
of ferocity ; neading with this impure filth
the enormous colossus of deftruftion, anima
ting it with the fire of hell, covering his fore
head with the diadam of kings, his (boulders
with senatorial robes, his body with a bra
zen coat of mail, and giving up to this
monster, until then unheard of riches, fields,
cities, provinces, empire and men."
" This monster has livedâwe have seen
him ; where is the catalogue of his victims ?
In the disaster at Lisbon, one hundred thou
sand citizens of every age, rank and sex per
ished in some minutes. An alphabetical lift,
some months after, was drawn up of the
names of those unfortunate viftims, for the
benefit of the families who survived the phy
sical revolution : why not follow this exam
ple with refpeft to the political revolution
of France. Such is the firft part of the ufe
ful work, more philosophical than is thought,
more disposing to internal peace than is ima
gined, which I give to the public. " It is
philosophical/ I repeat. âHow much to
think ofâto consider, will ihe
contained in the firft and second volume of
the History of Crimes committed during the
Revolution, enriched with cuts and revolu
tionary chronological tables, afford to all or
ders of readers; whether foreign or domeltic!
How -. tny persons' thoughts will it turn
towards themselves ! What a load of re
morse will it'not excite ! Noble 3, clergy,
kings, and your people, who have fuffered
most, run over this repertory, you will there
fee what you have to reproach yourselves
with. The friends of humanity will ap
plaud this idea, they will thereby feel more
fittingly the necessity of totally abolishing
the punishment of death, a necessity so otten
demonstrated in my Journals of the Revo
lution in Paris, and a proposition always vain
ly agitated in our three firft legidatures."
" Let us unveil this lift of judicial mafla
cres ; this eloquent lift will prove that every
1 w which delivers the lives of citizens, to
the blunders, errors and passions of their fel
low-creatures, it is in faft unjust and bad.
It is time that we snatch the axe out of the
hands of justice, and confine her to her scales
âit is time that (he should be inverted with
those god-like attributes, which the fiend'
like passions of. men have torn from her."
" We may charge all our evils to the
flight of the king, to which step he was
compelled by the continued insults and dan
gers to which he was hourly exposed. Had
Louis been less timid, France at this day
would not have been in the ruined state (he

the florms of domestic faction and foreign

must how afford the mod godlike fatisfac

that awaited tbeir beloved veflel by running *
on the coast of England, they are not like
ly to be ftrandedon the coast of France, but
that what some time ago appeared to be the
main land of France, is now found to be on
ly five or perhaps three fell rocks, set up
there by some \vicked Americans to (hip
wreck their national veflel, which, although
built by tuif/om, of the materials of VIR
TUE, and hitherto navigated by Patriotism,
is Hill the object of their inveterate malice,
hatred, envy and ill-willâAs France is con
demning those five rocks as a national re
proash, we indulge the well founded ex
pectation of soon feeing them removed, or
light houses put where they are, to warn
those who may visit their coast where the
danger lies ; as France I fay, is crying
out against those five rocks, should not A

indulged the diabolical hope of feeing the
fleet of the United States under convoy of

igated'by able, patriotic and experienced
seamen, cast away upon those five newly dis
covered and dangerous rocks. Yes \ my 1
fellow-citizens, we have men of that black

der the ma(k of " ettrlujl-ue pcttr 'iQtiJrh," been
the instigators of all the depredations com
mitted property by order of the
headed mopjlrr," and have openly juf
tified and secretly enjoyed the fiend-like
pleasures of feeing their country a prey to ,
all the misfortunes of a ruined commerce,
and general individual bankruptcy. The
fatisfa&ion of th >fe monsters would no doubt
have been -mcrer/ed had our country be
come a prey to the anarchy and civil war
prepared for it with so muih art and ad
dress by the different agents of Jacobinism,
sent out by the different sanguinary factions
who have exercised . the powers of govern
ment in France for several years pift ; but
th inks be to God, who made use of the
Great Washington as an instrument in his
hands to avert all the horrors contemplated *
with so much pleasing anticipation by the
Jacobins among lis ; who, as they were idol
izers of the Robefpierres, the Carriers, and
other monsters who have deluged France
with blood, would no doubt have followed
the objects of their adoration through all
the difgraceful bloody scenes which have
been played in France. Happy are ye !
â¢virtuous and patriotic Federal Americans !
whom I glory in calling my^countrymen, v
th9t you had a Washington at the head of
affairs. And you ! venerable, virtuous,
good old man ! What must be your fatis
faction ! How god-like must be your feel
ing to think that the only plausible juftifica-* ,
tion your enemies have had for villifying and
traducing your irreproachable character jsj ,
removed ! The people of France are doing
justice to your chara&er. by execrating the
engines among them of an abandoned Ame
' rican faftion, who have condemned the
equitable measures entered into by you for
the good of your cojintry. Receive, O il
lustrious Washington, the warmest benedic
tions of a grateful and virtuous Pebple, for
thy long continued faithful services, during a
period of twenty years, ainidft difficulties
and 1 dangers ; in which time, although ex
ercising ftiftions the most important and ar
duous, and not being exempt from the frail
ty attached to humanity , yet, in no one in
stance will impartial, c ndid reason, find
cauft to condemn thy conduct. Support
ed by the everlasting pillars of an approv
ing conscience, and the esteem of the vir
tuous part of you fellow-citizens, the even
ing of your days will be the foretafte of
that (late of eternal bliss, which awaits you
hereafter, where no Paine ever did or can
enter. Let the remainder of your day 3be
happy ; for, the good work of national feli
city begun by you, will be continued by
tha firm, tried and patriotic Adams, who,
like his great prsdeceflor, (landing firm on
the rock of integrity, will hold his hfad in
fun-bearas, while the storms of oiforgaaizing
Jacobinic faction shall beat in silent mur
murs at his feet.
As the hydra of Jacobinism originated in
France, whence it spread its malignant in
fluence to other countries, it is to be hoped
that the mortal stab about to be given the

on the banks of the Atribonite river, with
several field pieces in their front, with which
theygradually approached that pod, till in
the ill of this month they made dispositions'
to attack it; they encamped themselves up
on a hill, inclining towards the Salina where
they mounted one heavy gun and a mortar,
at the fame time they sent a large body of
| troops to encamp at the watering place,
which cut of water and provilions
from the town to Gros Morne and Camp

attacked by the cannon and (hells from the

CAUTION. "
WHEREAS a combination of men in this m
county hare undertaken to enrich tham- , ih
felveÂ»,by fabricating titles to sundry valuable trads h
of land, the ptopevty of gentlemen living in New ci
Yoik, Philadelphia, London and Paris, lor which ) Â«
trail-* of hnd large funis of money have been paid | Â»
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchafcrs i' (
It is therefore just that public information should 2
be Â£iven, to the end, that the injured may fetk re- 1
dress while the na<fcn have property, and are to be t
found. Those who have bein discovered arcTru- ' #
mnn Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re-
I fide in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
j several others who go under fictitious names. It is
â  supposed that the lands offered fcr falcon those fa-
f bricated titles, are at lead worth fifty thousand e
â  doli&rs. Such as we have a&ual knowledge of are t
i as follows ; Lots No. II and la, Otfego patent, j f
thousand acres each, the ailual property of William I
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64. c
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of i i
Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and James Averill
and other*, of tkii- State. There is some grounds c
to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
' Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their ; j
management. âThe Printers will do well to give
Â£ this a place in their papers, as well to caution the â 
L ! public against purchasing those lands, as also to de- (
9 prive those men in future from imposing on indivi-
C dusfs, which their education and address have en- j
Ã¼bled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a ftiopkeepcr of some note in tfiis country.
The following affidavits will fct in a dear point
of view the wick#dnefs of those men, which when
the publifc have peruf' d, will induce them to ex
cuse the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 28th, 1797.
I Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
n ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
Truman Harrifon, ol the fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for lot No. 58, O Ifgo patent, which
was the property oi W Uii'm T W.uiklin now Mr.
Chamofit's and others ; and further the laid Joseph
and Trtoman did periuademe to do this agairtft my
. inclination, which was made out on the icth day
I of Noremher, 1793, or set back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and furthtr the namÂ« of
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fi&itious namÂ®,
