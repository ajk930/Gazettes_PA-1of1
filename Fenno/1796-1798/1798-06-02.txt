plated giving to tlie President jhe power of
admitting men into military service, under the
name of Volunteer Corps, who are liable to
be called upon to do military duty, at any
time when the President shall think proper,
after they shall have offered, and lie has ac
cepted of their service. Upon tlie firft cOnsi
deration of this seCtion an objection was made'
on conllitutional ground to this, mode of rais
ing Joldiers, fuppof:ng they were to be consi
dered as Militia. To this it was answered
that these volunteers were not to be considered
as Militia, but as making a part of the army
of the United States*
It appeared to him difficult precisely to de
lineate and define what kind of Corps this is
to he. In some reflects it will be similar to
the Militia ; in some refpeets to the regular
army of the United States, and again distin
guishable from both. They are in some de
gree similar to the Militia, inasmuch as they
are to remain at home, except upon special
calls of the President to do duty. The Volun
teers, when called into attual service, and
whilst remainingin it, are to be under the fame
rules, and entitled to the fame pay and emo
luments as the other troops. The Militia are
like these Volunteers fubjett to the fame rules
and regulations, , and to the fame pay and
emoluments with the army of the United
States; and like Volunteers, when not
called into service, are not fubjeÂ£t to therule9
and regulations of the army, nor entitled to>
their pay and emoluments. In these particu
lars, therefore, this corps very much resem
bles the Miljiia.
In other refpefts, these Volunteers very
muchrefetnble the army of the United States;
inasmuch as they are to be enlisted (no N t, pro
perly so by name, but in a way equally
tual by giving their consent to serve) they are
also to be conlidcred as making part of the
army, though remaining at home ; they are
also like the army, inasmuch as their officers
are not appointed by themselves, or by the
Individual States, as in the Militia, but by the
President of rive United States ; and inasmuch
that they will be obliged to do duty for the
whole two years, if required, whilst the Mili
tia do duty by rotation, according to regula
tions provided for the purpose. Seeing, there
fore, that these Volunteers are in some re
fpedts like the Militia, and i % others like the
regulars, it was not to be wondered at that a
con/litutional objection should have arisen.
The Conftittition does not recognize more
than two descriptions of troÂ®ps, viz. Army
and Militia. The _%*: ny proposed to beraifed
by means of these Volunteers is of a kind nor
known in the Constitution, but seems to bÂ£of
a description about halfway betwixt a regular
landing army and a militia. If the principle
proppfed to be adopted in this fedion be ad
mitted, the consequence tiiay be, that all the
regulations provided in the Cnnflitution for
securing a good Militia, may be evaded, and
the whole of the Militia he turned into a kind
of Public Standing Army. For flippofing that
the regulations for the government of these
Volunteers aremore favourable inrheir etfeds
than those provided for the Militia, and it is
more advantageous to a man to belong to a
Volunteer Corps than to the Militia, citizens
would generally leave the Militia, and ar
range themselves under the head of Volun
teers. It is true, there are some provilions in.
this feition which may have a tendency to
prevent this ; but on the other hand, there
are some provnions which would encourage
them to do it. For ip.ftance, the clause which
directs that these Volunteers shall only be em
ployed in their own, or an adjoining State, is
an advantage, as the Militia, whilst in service,
can be called any where as-ordinary regular
troops. The objections, therefore,â againffc
raising Volunteers of this description are, that
it will have a tendency to destroy the Militia,
and convert the whole of it into an army,
thereby transferring the power of appointing
the Officers from the Individual State?, to the
President of the United States.
Waving, however, the conftitutionalobjec
tion, he make a few remarks on the ex
pediency of the measure. It appeared to him,
on the one hand, that the advantages contem
plated by this clause, w fll not be obtained,
and 011 the other, that great inconveni
encies would arise from carrying it into etf'eCf.
he believed also the advantages might be ob
tained without having rccourf'e to this provi
[ fion. If the real intention of tjie bill is only
to induce a number of young men to make a (
tender of their services as Volunteers for the
defence ot the United States, he believed the
provisions already existing in the Militia Law
are fufficient to effeft the objedt. Byth;H- law
it is provided that a certain number of Vo
lunteer Corps may be attached to each batta
lion of the Militia ; and if a number of yoi-ng
menwifhto make a voluntary tender of Their
service, lie saw no difficulty in their doing it
as a part of the militia of the United States*
As far as refpefts the (tare of Pennsylvania,
feveralot the batralions, which are entitled by
law to have Light Infantry, or Rifle Men, at
tached to them, have them not a: pre lent*
And he believed scarcely any- of the LightInfantry Volunteer Corps, or Troopsof Horse
of this city, have got their full complement
of me 1 ; "there could be no difficulty, there
fore, iTi young men making themselves Volun
teers, either byeltablilh ng new corps of mili
tia or by joining such as aie at present on foot.
How tar the deficency in respect to these vo
lunrary corps might exist in other parts of the
Ull.on, he could not fay ; but he recollected
tlvir tne gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr.
Ha per) when freaking on a subject in some
decree domiciled with this, had said, that
though there appeared to be many troops ot
horse to the southward, they rather existed
on paper than otherwif;. He supposed, there
fore, that there was a good opening for volun
teer young men in that quarter. Besides, the
law of latl session, ordering a detachment of
go,ooo Militia, provides that the President
shall have the power of accepting of any Vo
lunteer Corps of Militia who shall offer their
service. He did not fee, therefore, any ad
vantage to be derived tt> the defence of the
country, by means of this clause, which could
not be obtained by means of the laws already
fexiting.
The committee were told the other day,
that by virtut of thpbill, a number of Volun
teer corps would be raised, who would afTo
ciate themselves for the purpose of learning
the Military Art, which would be of great
service to the Union. He law nothing of this
fort in this bill which was not lonimon to all
the Militia. It would; therefore, be a mat
ter of choice, and it was the fame with all
those campanies of Militia of which he had
spoken, the lighf infantry companies and
troops of horse belonging to the militia having
uniformly taken more pains than the other
Corps k-f the Militia to make themselves mas
ters of tu.litary d.fcipline.âlt was said also
at the fame time, thaf these corps weie to no
minate ihdir own officers, and that they would
receive their cominiflions from the Pieli. ant.
He did not underltand th.sfrom the bill ; it
contains no pfovifiou of the kind, and if it did
such provision would be unconft tutional.
The bill fays the Officers of these Volunteer
Corps shall be appointed by the Pielident,
and the Conflitutton directs that the President
or Heads of Department (hall appoint all Of
ficers whose appointment is not otherwise
provided by ilie Conflitution. If these young
men were to enrol themselves as a part of the
Militia, they wotild then in theftate of Penn
sylvania, have the choice of their own officers
by law, but, accordiÂ«g 'o the proposed effa
blifhineni, they cannot do th'S. They may
recommend a perl' 11 as an officer, but this
could not be called a nominal ion of an officer.
But he believed serious objections might be
found to th s provifiou 011 the ground of expe
diency. What is to be the organization of
thele corps f They are to be dillinfl from the
Militia, it is not proposed that they should
individually enlist, but form themselves into
allocations, which would be literally Mili
tary Alfociat ons, and Military AlTociations to
last for,two years. To conlift of whom! Of
those persons, who, from their (ituation in
life, are a! le to arm, clothe and equip them
ftlves at the roivn expence. It was therefore
givingan exclusive privilege to a certain class
of men (young merchants, lawyers and others)
who are poirelfed ">f more wealth than their
poorer neighbours, to form a Military AlTb
ciation. And for what purpose i They are
liable to be calle-i out to do Military duty in
any manner that the Prelident may think pro
per. 'I hey are to be altogether at his dilpoli
tion. Here,, then, is an alfociation of men,
authorized by law, a Military AHbciation,
and w hen thus organized, to be put within
the power of the President of the United
States, to be called into action, whenever he
pleases. For thare is no limitation in this
clause, as in the cafe of railing the Prov.lional
Army, that those men (hail be called into
service in cafe ot war, mvalion, or imminent
danger of invasion j but the President may ac
cept of tiieir services at any time. There is 110
limitation, except that wh'ch is upon the du
ration o/the law. The President is also to
accept whoin, and reject whom h<- pleases. So
thai if there be evils to be apprehended from 1
the exigence of a Stand : ng Army ; if there
was at any time ground ot alarm from efla
blifhments of thi.- kind endangering the exis
tence of Public Liberty, it would be inipof
fibleto foiin a Standing Army more dange
rous than this, t ere are men who, in thefirrt
place are to associate themselves, not here
and there nor taken 11d1lcr.nl nately, but men
of a peculiar cad, who are to aflociate ihem
fel es under the President, and to be called
upon to do duty by him. it need not be said,
that no danger is to be apprehended from the
Prefidem's abusing this powerâand that we
ought to have confidence in him; for, if
a majority of this house are ready to fay that
no danger is to be apprehended from efta- '
blifhments of this kind, and that Standing
Armiesare never abusedâwho 1 ave discard
ed all those principles favourable to liberty
which heretofore actuated the councils of this
country, no arguments which he could make
life of would have any effect upon their minds.
But he took it for granted, that Standing Ar
mies were considered as a dangerous weapon,
and ought to be guarded againfl. It wasfroin
this conviClion, that he thought it unneces
sary to fay any thing on the danger of encou- '
raging these eftablifliments ; and if that prin
ciple was admitted, he would fay that the
army now proposed, would be a Standing
Army of the worll kind, as the men are to colt
nothing, extept w hen in service, and as they
are to be unlimited in their number. He
knew it was not in our power (our revenues
not being fufficient for it) to raise a Standing
Army in the o;dinary way, large enough to
prove dangerous to the liberties of the cottn- i
try ; but t-lje manner in which this force, is J
proposed to be raised, removes the great fecu- i
rity which we otherwise (hould have from our '
inability to pay a large Standing Army.
Nor could Mr. G. believe that the advan- '
tages which gentlemen promised themselves
would result to the defence of the country '
from the service of these young men. For
who are the men who are to form these corps ? |
They are men who can afford to arm, cltithe j
and equip themselves ; and could it be ex- j
petted, Mr. G. asked, that Young Men, in
the situation of life which these young men j
tnull be in, would wish to enlist themselves â¢
as private soldiers for two years? He should
suppose not. These young men would be I
molt hkely to repel any sudden invasion ; t
Would be active and fcrviceable to take a tour â 
of duty for three or fix months, in common i
with their fellbw citizens of the Militia ; but !
it is not confident with the principles of hu- |
man nature to suppose, that young men of !
this description who have got other pursuits j
in view, and who wish to effablifh themlelves '
inbulinefs, would be willing to lay all aside â¢
for the bufinel's of a soldier. For a cafe of '
emergency, or as Officers, he should suppose
them willing to engage in the service, but not
as common soldiers. j
Mr. G. did not believe, therefore, that the .
service which ihefe young men expefled to '
be called upon to perform was a military fer- â 
vice of two years. He believed few of them â¢
would be willing to enter, if they thought
they were the next day liable to be called up-
t
â¢o to perform tw<? years service private sol
diers, though they might be ready to take
their full (hare, or more, of Military duty.
Upon the whole, Mr. G. said, it appeared
to him that thisfection contemplated the etec
tion of a (landing Military Force of the very
worlt kind, to confitt of young men not regu
lated by law, but by alfociation. In fhorr, it
was, in his idea, a plan to arm one description
of men, exclUively of othfcrs, and give them
I to the P-efident of the United States, to be
used as he plea fed and what security had they
that they would not be used for dangerous
purposes ? If he wasmidaken in hisconftruc
tion of this bill, he wished to be rectified }
but, with his prefentimprellions, he mult hope
the fettion would be (truck out.

PHILADELPHIA,
SATURDAY EVENING, June 2.
COMMUNICATION.
The propriety of wearing some badge of diftinc
tion 16 suggested to the different volunteer corps
now forming in this city. Whether ft is proper to
wear any badge merely for the purpose of denot
ing the political i'rntiments of our fellow citizens,
is a quettion which has created some doubt ; but
that it i 9 proper to distinguish those who now so
gallantly offer their services to their country, mult
be obvifus to all It haanow become neccllary to
give a military appearance to ths United States.
Nothing perhaps can be better calculated to excite
the military ardor of the people, or to impress up
on the minds of the more ignoraht class of the
community, that throifgh the rapacity and perfidy
of France, preparation is as necessary as war is in
evitable. Upon the bulk oi mankind, parade,
and even ostentation, moil forcibly operates, and
the fight of a feather or an uniform, may give
greater aid than could at fir ft be imagined, to mo
tives of duty and patriotism. It is befidss neces
sary, that the enthusiasm which animates the breasts
of Americans, (hould be rendered viGble to the
wnrld, that it (hould be known how great is our
strength ; wherein itcoi;fifts ; what is the number
of our troops ; and of whom they are composed.
It is not fufficient for this purpose to wear only thr
cockade, since that is worn by persons who neither
are nor mean to become foldicrs, and they ought
fur. ly to be excluded from the honor attached to
vo untarily undertaking the defence of our liberty
an independence.
A&uated by these opinions, the volunteer com
pany of Philadelphia Grenadiers have entered into
a resolution to wejr at all times a black feather in
r heir hats, and to appear npon Sundays in full uni
form. I? is hoped that this example will be fol
lowed The effe<st cannot be injurious ;it is be
lieved thÂ»t it would be found to be beneficial.

B ETHREN,
It is my sincere wish that, as soon as we
get our cioathing anil are organised, we (hall
meet' re ularly n Sundays, tor, the pur
pose of attending divine service. As per
sons . f various r liginus denominations will
compose the companies, it will be advifea
ble to attend tHe different places of worftu'p
alternaie y If this recommendation (hould
meet with the approbation of my fellow
foldicrs, the belt eff.Ss will undoubtedly
bethercfult. Our morals, if we are seri
ous, will bÂ« improved ;rhe cioathing which
we shall wear as soldiers will alf > answer for
our dress as citizen# on the sabbath : and a
military enthusiasm will dc created which
will greatly encreafe our numbers.

At an annual meeting of tire CoYporation
of the Chofrn Freeholders, for the County
of Suflex, in the State of New-Jersey,
held at Newton, on the loth of May,
179#.
Major Thomas Paul, from a Committee
appointed for that purpose, reported the
following address :
To JOHN ADAMS,
President of the United States.
sir,
FEELING, in common with the whole
American people, the feniibilities excited
by the present alarming crisisâthe incor
pora ed body of the chosen freeholders for
the county of SufT x, in the state of New-
Jersey, bcli. Tt'ngit to be their duty, to con
vey to the Chief Mag Urate of the union,
the exprtflion of their sent me.ts and de
terminations,
Discerning no motive for distrust in the
integrity of the public f rvants, who, pof
fefling the fame interests with their fellow
citizens administer the government by their
choiceâwe have repelled with indignation
the attempts that have been mads, abroad
and at home, to separate the people
their conflicted authorities Placing espe
cial and entire confidence in the patriotifn),
virtue and wildom of which your early,
faithful and continued services are the in
controvertible proofâwe have regarded,
with peculiar pleaftire and approbation, the
earned, sincere and upright endeavour ,
wh:ch you have unremittingly used for the
preservation of peace, and the relloration of
harmony with the French republic, on terms
compatible with the eflential rights and
sovereignty of the nation.
The world mud be- convinced of the
spirit of justice and moderation which has
afluated you in the conduct of our foreign
relations, and of the rapacity and profligacy
of those who, rejefting your pacific over
tures, require of us to pay for our own ig
nomy ; and to surrender at once the trea
sures and independence of America.
If perseverance in pretensions like these
(hould leave us no alternative but submission
or refillance, Americans cannot hesitate to
choose. If the pride and the injustice of
France, Qr any foreign power, should drive
us to the last solemn appeal, which by all
honorable meir.6 we would have avoided ;
the zeal and the unanimity of our efforts
will convince them, that we are not a di.
sided or a degraded people.
For ourselves personally, we allure you,
Sir, that in such a contefl, no confidrra
iotis of expence or of danger, can induce
is to abandon the government of our choice,
or to relax in a fiugle exertion of the power
we pofTefs in support of aur national rights,
honor and sovereignty.
The above address being read and unarii
moufly approved of by the corporation,
confiding of thirty members, representing
the fifteen townlhip9 in. the county of Suf
sexâOn motion of Robert Ogdcn, Esq.
resolved, that the fame be signed by Major-
General William Helms, Direftor of the
Corporation, and be tranfinitted by the
Clerk, to Mark Th' mfon, Esq. one of
our Representatives in Congress, with a
request to present the fame to the President,
as expressive of the sentiments of this Cor
poration, and as ihey conceive, of the whole
body of the county of Suflex.
By order of the Corporation,
Wm. HELMS, Direftor.
Attest,
John Johnson, Clerk.
Tht Incorporated Body of Chosen Freeholders
for the County of Suffix.
CENTLEMEN,
I THANK yon for this obliging ad
dress. When you repelled with indignation
the attempts that have been made, abroad
and at home, to separate the people from
their constituted authorities, you ailed the
part of wife men and virtuous citizens.
The favorable allusion to my pad services
is very honorable to me, and your approba
tion of the late measures for the preserva
tion of peace, and restoration of harmony
with the French Republic, gives me great
futisfa&ion.
Your choice ef resistance, in preference
to submission, pride and injufticr, must be
approved of by all independent and impar
tial minds.
Your afTurance, that no consideration of
danger, or expence, can induce you to aban
don the government of your choice, or relax
in a single exertion of the power you pofTefs,
in support of our national rights, honor and
sovereignty, does you great honor.
John Adams.

The MiyorJ Deputy Mayor, Recorder, Ai
de ' men and t.omwnn Council of t e borough
I of Eiz btth, in their Common Hall affem*
j bled this fourth day of Miy, 1798
Do resolve unanimously,
1. That in the opinion of this Corporati
on, the President of the United States is en
titled to the warmed thanks and approbati
on of his country, for his inftruftions to our
Envoys at Paris ; inasmuch, as they manifeft
the utmost firmnefs upon evrrt' point, which
might affeft the Neutrality and Independence
of these United States, and the highelt fpi
rit of conciliation upon every point, whertby
our unhappy difference with the French re
public might be accommodated.
2. That th-; late dispatches from our En
voys, have made known, such attempts to
render the people of these United States,
tributaries to the Republic of France ; such
ideas of our being a divided people, and a
people separated from their government ;
and such threats of humbling our republic,
or of parcelling us out, in the manner they
have humbled and parcelled out some of the
Republics in Europe, as deserve the most
marked indignation of every free and inde
peadent American.
3. That the power and malice, cupidily
and ambition, of the French Republic, con
sidered together, raise such apptehenfions of
danger, as naturally tend to produce among
all true lovers of their country, the most
perfeA union, and the greatest a&ivity,
which, in aid of the efforts of our national
Councils, which we pledge ourselves to fup-'
port, will, we trust, enable ua by the blef
ting of God, to set at defiance the machina
tions of all our enemies.
4. That it is expedient for the citizens in
this borough, at this a' 1 important crisis, to
fend an address to'the President and both
Houses of Congress, expreflive of the fore
going sentiments, and of an entire confi
dence in their wisdom, firmnefs and patrio
tism.
5. That the Mayor do transmit the fore,
going rÂ«f .lotions, together with the address,
to the Hon. Jonathan Dayton, with a re
quest, that he together with such of the o
thei Members of the Senate and House of
Representatives from the State of New-Jer
fey,as may find it convenient, would prelent
or cause the fame to be presented in such
manner as they may judge most proper.

Aldermen, and Common Council of the Bo
rough of Elin ibeth in Ncw-Jerfry.
GINTLEMEN.
Your refutations adopted on the fourth of
this month, have been presented to me by
the Speaker. Mr. Dayton.
Your thanks for the inftruftions to our
Envoys, as they manifeft firmnefi on every
point, which might affeft the neutrality and
independence of the United S ates, and the
highefl 'pirit of conciliation, upon every o
therpoint, whertby our unhappy differen
ce3 with the French Republic might be ac
commodated, are extremely acceptable and
grateful to me.
The marked indignation you express, at
the unworthv treatment of this nation in
the persons and funftions of her Envoys,
are the just sentiments of every free and in
dependent Amer can.
The present crifn certainly calls for the
most perfect union and greatest aitivity. a
mong the true lovers of their country in aid
of the efforts of our national Councils, which
you ncbly pledge yourselves to support.
I trust with y U, that by the bit fling of
God, we may set at defiance the machinati

To the Citizens of the Town of Portland, in
the Diftria of Maine, in the State of Maf
flchufetts.
GENTLEMEN,
SENTIMENTS more worthy of free
men and free Republicans, than those, which
you expre(9 in your addrefi, presented to me
by your Representative in Congress, Mr.
Wadfwrorth, have never appeared.
For your personal civilities to me, I can
only return my thanks ; but when you de
clare, as a part of the Amtrioan people,
educated in the love and enjoyment of liber
ty, and in habits of veneration for repub
lican Virtues, that you have no language to
express. your indignation at the late mea
sures of the French Republic, originating
in the most nefarious and corrupt stratagems
to annihilate our national sovereignty; when
you declare that while every principle of
duty and interest prompt you to unite in
the preservation and defence of our excellent
conjlitutwnÂ» and in the support of those by
whom it has been faithfully administered,
you cannot express your deep regret, that
the citizens of FrancÂ®, do not pofTefs virtue
fufficient to merit- the bleflings of a free
government; when you declare, that how
ever wicked and hostile may be the designs
upon us, your confidence, by the favor of
Heaven, is in the fortitude and unanimity
of our countrymen to repress their pernicious
effects, and that you believe, at the fame :
time, that a nation under the yoke and rod
of dtfpotifm, and whofa councils are dif- i
traded and corrupted, ought not to be fear- ;
ed,~l am altogether unable to answer you 1
but with my unfeigned admiration. 1

their profeflional knowledge in no wife entitles
