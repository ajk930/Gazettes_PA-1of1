For a Hurting. in my former publication, that fa
Â»Â« Qr. Oniric ought to have been the lait per- h:
foil in the worty to mention any th ug in al- I
lulion to the mortality of that period"â w
meaning the month of September, andmorV.
efpi'ciafly that part in which the firft letter
of Dr. CutrÃ, above quoted, came out. â
We find hare that Dr. Currie afftrts, that f
bfter the "firiSeji enquiry" he was " con
vinced" that there were not mure than " 40
or 50 in the whole city"â" ronjined bv tt
the genuine yellow fever." Let us pot this j r
affeition in its proper light ; for it is the ir
greatelt insult that Dr. Currie could have it
offered to the feelings, as well as to the un- d
derftandinga of the citizens. At this very I
time, and for some days preceding moh than ii
tint number w;re daily falling vieb'm* to the a
diseaseâas the following statement (hews : n

( * This is the date of Dr. Currie's letter. )'â  t
'Tis true â-the Dr. had the sagacity to
difcoverthat there was " another formidable l
disease prevalent" âthe " common remit- r
tent,or fall fever." Whether Dr. Currie, r
in his own praftice, fuffrrs his patients to c
be carried ofFby this "formidable" disease !
I know not.âln general it is not fatal. But 1
let us uow take a view of Dr. Currie's 2d c
pamp'alit, p. 15, 16, which was publiflied f
in January 1794. Here he fays "as soon v
as the contagion had reached the central part t
of the city, the difeafc spread with ajlon- f
ijhing rabidity. In tht course of Augufl,
there were more thau 300 funerals ; tow- f
ards the clufe of the mouÂ»h, twenty were f
buried of a day." Does Dr. Currie mean i
that they died of the " genuine yellow fe- a
vcr" or of that formidable disease " the 1
Common remittent or fall fever" ? He goes c
on again to fay, " In September the diieafe c
increnfed amaxingly In the course of the inonth c
about 1400 citizens Were added to the lift of I
mortality ; towards its close, from 50 to 90 t
were buried of .1 day,'* &c. 1
Surely, Dr. Currie, if you have the small- t
c sV sense of (harheâyou will blush at thus t
expoftog and refuting yot/rfelf!
Tt" lifftory of Dr. Rufli's conduft to
Dr. Glentworth, is grossly misrepresented. <
Dr. R. found Dr. G. with a full and tense
putfe, the pupils of his eyes dilated, and his 1
head affecled with great pain. In this (late
of his disease he advifed*b!eeding- To this
lir, G. nhjgfted unless Dr. Currie approved 1
âft! u. 1 l?iÂ» âft. tHgc not' :!
praftice as he did in the prevailing fever,
andoNefted to eonfulting with him. Up
on this he took his leave of Dr. G. but not
without ijrgiflt him a 2d time to be bled,
and gave as a reason for it, that he had
symptoms of an hydrocephalic tendl icy.â
Dr. R. denies that he even h'nted to him to
fettle his affairs. This ndvice he has never
given without the request of the friends of
the Tick; and then in am; that I be
lieve has never offended, or been complained
of by any body. Dr. G. it is true, rfcover
td without bleeding (though Dr. C. asserts
that he was reduced " aknoft to death's
door by the violence of his remedies") af
ter a long confinement to his room. Dr. C.
seems to suppose that bleeding is used only to
five life-. Those who undc-rlland the use
and benefits of this remedy, know that.it is
often prescribed to Jhorten the duration of
acute diseases, and to prevent their termina
tion in such as are of a chronic nature.
Mr. Connor had the usual symptoms of
infeftion in his eyes and pulse when he called
' upon Dr. Ruth-âfor which he advised him
to use the depleting remedies. They had
the desired effeft, and soon romoved his in
disposition. Dr. R. saw Miss Cownor but
once during her illness; for he was so worn
iovvn with fatigue and fickiiefs, that he was
forced to confine his vif;is towards the close
of the d'feafe, chirfly to his old patients.
Miss C. was attended chiefly by myfelfâ
and I think it highly probable that a more
liberal use of the depleting remedies, would
have rendcied the issue of her disease differ
ent from what it was. Dr. Currie, who,
in 1793, 1794 and 1797, preferibed with
fafety and success much larger and more fre
quent doses Â«f the mercurial purges than were
taken by MifÃ C. cannot and does not believe
that (he died hi consequence of their dras
tic operation.
The patient whom Dr. R. refufed to visit,
in consultation with a Bark and Wine Dr.
was Mr. DaVis, then partner with Mr.
Chancellor. The reasons we have already
given winch induced Dr. R. not to consult
with a p'uyfician who did not praftice in a
similar way with himfelfâlt is not neccffary
to repeat them. In eonfequence of this
i~fufal, Dr. R. was requested to visit and
attend Mr. D. alone. He found him with
a full pulse, and great k" 1 and burning in
his stomach, under the use of tonic remedies.
He had been bled, hut Dr. R. thought too
(paring!)'- He ordered him to lose eight
ounces of blood which afforded him consi
derable relief. Mercury was likewise ex
hibited libeVally in his cafe, under the use
of which he recovered. As a proqf of the
dcftrutlive effects of in this fever, I
mu | a dd here, that, my fellow-ftudent,
Mr. Fi!hs>r, thought he had injured Mr.
Davis by 2 few fpoopfuls of the infufion of
the bark which he had prescribed for him
a ft e r lie had overcome the inflammatory
symptoms by the depleting remedies.
Dr. Currie lias asserted that " Those ac
quainted with the causes and laws of conta
gion, thought him (Dr. Rufn) insane."
This expression of the " causes and laws of ,
contagion" has frequently- helped Dr. C.
at a non-plus, asaliy cne will fee who reads
his publications. In being charged with 1
insanity, Dr. llufh has (harcd in the calum
ny with many men who have darei to think
and aft differently from the habits and pre
judices of their cotemporai iea. It would
be happy for Dr. C. if his Conduft in 1793
and 1797, had fubjefted hita only to this
imputation. The incoiiliftency, folly, and
falfthoods of his publications and conduft, ,t
have procured him very different epithets.
I need not name them. No lapse of years r !
will ever \<-ear them away

For the Gazette of /a* United States. e
Mr. Fenno, "
As Mr. Cobbett's condescension in at- "
tempting to palliate tjpo charge of publifli- M
ing sentiments unfriendly to lour revolution, J
implies a difavowai of any defi'gn to discredit ''
it, I fnould be at variance with my former r
declaration, were I not to fay, I was pleased. 0
I can by no means however admit, that the
imputation was unfounded. In the inflance v
alluded to, the merit of Mr. Gibbon being
made to reft upon his loyalty, the want of \
it, is of course the reproach applied to Dr. c
Franklin ; and in this view, certainly war- 1
rants my inference of its involving a "general
censure upon the afters in the revolution. 1
Nor can I think it at all material, to the eftab- j
lifliment of my conchifion,tobe able to prove
that similar sentiments to those ascribed to ' 1
â¢ the Doftor, were uttered by others.
If Franklin was treacherous and malicious, ]
he certainly did not fft:w these qualities in |
requefling Mr. Gibbon's company. If his I J
reÂ«l design ,was to assassinate the historian, I
can only fay, it does not appear j and I be- I
lieve moil men will admit, that there was at '
lead as much wit as malice in the Doftor's
effenfive retort ; . (or prediction, ifitmuft be
so :) or if even the latter predominated, it
was so far frori* being a ivanton attack, that
there was fufficient cause to excite some re
sentment, in the mod milky disposition
With refpeft to the'publication of the
story, (whether true or not) I make no dif
ficulty of faying, that in my opinion, it was
improper, and that it had but too much the
appearance of " a fort of dunghill-cock tri
umph." Though I cannot think it either
decent or necessary, especially upon a prin
ciple of conciliation, that every idle, injudi
cious, or malevolent news-paper paragraph,
' (hould be repelled, at whatever expence to |
the feelings and charafters of not the least 1
refpeftable part of the communityâand |
those too, who may as much disapprove of t
the publication, as Mr Cobbett himfelf.
As to my being a bitter enemy to Great
-1 Britain, an abettor of " certain political va
garies", a protestor of " American baseness",
and a " lover of revolutionary France 11 , I on
-1 ly smile at the insinuations, harsh as they are.
â  " Sejanus, IVolfey, hurt not honejl Fleuri."
1 But from what Mr. Cobbett could have tak
l en up these ideas, lam at alofs to conceive.
~ To right howevar, let him be affur
, ed, that Mr. Fenno's subscriber, Tees the
- folly and baseness of too many of his eoun
t trymen with equal concern and indignation.
, That in love to revolutionary France, he
I yields not even to the editor of Porcupine's
Gazette :âand as to Great-Britain, with
3 all her errors and vices (and little perhaps
r as America may owe her,) considering the
f (Station in which she has .been, fortuitoufly
- placed, by the dreadful convulsions of Eu
-1 rope, so far from wilhing her downfall, he
- considers her preservation as of real inipor
-8 tance to mankind, and has long looked up
s on her as the barrier betwixt the world and
anarchy. He makes this declaration, not
. because he thinks it due to the manner in
0 which his observations have been treated,
e but because he takes the sentiment tobejuft,
s and knows it to be honest, and as it may
f serve to (hew, that if he is au officious, he is
1- not an uncandid defender of American
honour.
if When Mr. Cobbett tells me, that recon
d ciliation and harmony with the ignorant and
n rancorous, is not to be effefted by mildness
d and forbearance, he need not have added his
1- assurance to give weight to so obvious a po
it fition. But Â»f he will again take the trou-.
n Me of perusing my remarks, he will perceive
w that die animosities to be buried, were not
"e the wife and the ignorant,
s. the generous and the rancorous, but between
- " the people of the two Hations" ; that is,
â e between the good and faithful fubjeUs of the
d king of Great-Britain, and the good citizens
r- of the United States of Americaâif I may
3. be excused the vagary.
:h Why such emphafisandfignificance,(hould
e- have been attached to the word fubferiber,
re it is for Mr. Cobbett to explain. It was
fe innocently adopted as .a (ignature, without
f- any idea of the terrible effefts it was said to
oroduce upon some of the printing tribe,
t, Taking into view the word which precedes
r. it, it was probably fuggeiled by a desire to
r. sccount for the length of time which must
ly elapse, between the appearance of the offen
ilt five paragraph and my notice of it. Had I

ry how could I suppose it to have the smallest

Norraand. Savary, " The officers who his

who pqfTefles much zeal and patriotism ; but fed
upon his Â»ntry into this assembly, he was 1
misled by perfidious men. I move that his cor
name be struck off the lift. Boulay second
ed the motion. " Normand was the usual I( "
reporter of the military committee ; but that e
. duty was put upon him because he had a , tio
good "voice, and was more accuflomtd to the I ore
Tribune than his colleagues. He has con
t feffed to me that he was often compelled to ( ' e
r make reports which were contrary to his
opinion."
Ta'.lien, " If my testimony be of any j ] e {
s weight, I can attefy that Normand fought ha
r well at Quiberon, and that he obtained the foi
f erteem of Gen. Hoche by'his excellent con- th
dust in La Vendee.âNormand was ordered na
to be erased from the lift. an
j Thibaudean Bouh'y, "In confidopng j ia
tlie lift which the committee has presented

The liberation of the Marquis is not yet
confirmed. It was offered to him on condi
tion of his taking an oath that he would
proceed immediately to America. He re
plied, that though it was his intention to
go to America, he would not fubferibe to
ally oath for the purpose.
It may seem extraordinary at firft view,
that three Direftors, out of five, with the
majority of both cotuicils against them,
flionld have been able to have overcome the
other tfro direftors, as well as the councils,
and this without any violent commotionâ
but the plan of the councils and of Barthe
lemy and Carnot failed, as has so often hap
pened on former occafiotis, in a great mea
sure from indifcretion and imprudence
of many of their own party. The plan of
the moderate party was discovered before
its partisans were readv to carry it into ex
ecution, and the indiscretion of some of
their adherents in the councils, not only set
the three direftors upon their guard, but
determined them to (Irike the firft blow ;
Had they waited patiently, it is probable
that the next eleftion of a direftor mud have
added a friend to Barthelemy and Carnot :
but counting, as the pmrrty which have been
overpowered did, for a considerable time,
upon their being able to obtain the support
of Lareveillere Lepeaux, they proceeded
openly with measures hostile to the Direc
tory.
It is lingular that the fate of France (hould,
as we have every reason to believe it did, de
pend upon the decision of a man not endowed
with talents,-âa republican from principle, but
of a temper little suited to countenance the atroÂ«-
cious measures which Rewbell and Barras, un
der the plea of necessity, thought fit to t ike to
effedt their purpose. For some time La Rc
veilltreTrefitated. He was (hocked at the idea
of | new revolution.
Rewbell and Barras took pains to convince
him that the opposite party iu the councils, as
well ,as their two colleagues, meant nothing lefi
than the restoration of the ancient form of go
vernment in France with all its imperfe<3ionsâ
they pointed out the -proceedihgs of some mem
bers of the'couwcils in proof of this opinionâ
thev convinced him of the-favorable difpofitioti
of the armies, e!<emplified> in their addrcfles,
and they aflured. him that no blood (hould be
fted. By, these means they gained him, when
Carnot thought lie was lure of him, and from
tjje time he took his dctermniat on. he never
once f\verve:l from it. Thus, upon the deci
finn of this man hung the fate of Pratice. and
in a certain degree, perhaps, the future securi
ty, happiness, and profpÂ«rity of Great Britain.

THE NEGOCIATION. '
The following article from the Tmif, of Sept.
I, <we believe to deferye notice, because the
Editor of that paper appears, to hat'e authori
ty for what he piiblifha.
Our readers will have obfet-ved tlirt hitherto
we hive been silent on the ftibjqjt of the pending,
Negotiation, hecaufe we did not consider qiir
felves authorifnd to announceany fails on which
the public could rely. We now think we can
state the following circumstances refpeiling. the
early ftageof the Negociation,without running
the risk of compromising oilrfelves : they are the
propositions made by M. Letourntur in his
Contre Projet delivered to Lord Malralbury, aÂ«
the basis upon which France wouUKran/ent to a
peace with Grrat Britain for herfelf and her al
lies, Spain and Holland.
" France demanded the restitution of all the
peaces taken from her.
11 The restoration of the (hips taken, and the
value of those destroyed at Toulon.
" The abandonment of the use of the title of
King of France. ,
Â«< An alteration of the Navigation Aft.
" In the course of conversation. M- Letour
neur made some observations refpe-'fling the In
depcndei'c*.; of Ireland, which France wilhed to
quarantee.
FOR SPAIN
Â« France demanded the restitution r.f what
ever might be conquered from hcv during the
war. tocethir with the restoration of Gibraltar.
FOR HOLLAND.
" France demanded the restitution ofCeylon,
the Cape ef Good Hope, and all other con
certs made from her.
it The restitution of all imps or war, and
compensation for all (hips and merchandize
flopped and brought into port under the procla
mation of his majesty."
It is neceffarv to he underuood, that by trea
ties now existing with Spain and Holland, France
is bound not to leave any pla<-e belonging to
either, in the hands of the Englilh ; and that
the Dirt(Â£lorv have verv recently made declarj
tiona tn those powers of their ftedfaft intention
not to do anv thing by any pea.-e, contrary to
the constitution, or contrary to the existing
treaties.
Altho' we do not pretend to have any cor
respondent at Lisle, we have reason to be
lieve that the Negociation has not made
much progress since the firtl Pro] efts were
delivered by the refpeftive ambaffadm-s.â
Couriers have been certainly sent from the
Direftory to Madrid and the Hague, un
der the pretence of consulting the miniders
of Spain and Holland on the propositions
made by Great Britain ; but tho' there has
been abundant time to know the dispositi
ons of those two countries, yet we arls per
fuadled the negociation has been at a perfeft
stand, and is probably so at this hour.
It remains then to fee, whether France
will come forward to put an end ,to a farce,
that becomes tircfomc to her to continue to
play, and the means will mod likely be (liort
ly afforded her by the Emperor, who has
infilled upon the complete performance of
the preliminary treaty made with Buonaparte
âcomprizing in it the restitution of Man?
tua ; but above all, the appointment of a Con
grcfs, as stipulated, to terminate and adjud
the affairs of. the continent ; and until which
Kve do not believe there wilt be ail" definitive
treaty fignedby the Emperor.
This is the great objlacla, and the grand
bone of contention ; "and the reasons for
France avoiding it are obvious, since (he
would hpve during a long period of discussi
on, three great armies to maintain on her
frontiers, at an incredible expence, the
means of which could only be derived from
her internal resources. It is therefore more
than prrfba'ole that (he will prefer a war of
phmdtr, with the chance of conqiied, to
the risk of internal cofifufioris, which the
railing so much money, and the great drain
of supplies to be found from within would
infallibly produce.
Her<; then the refleftingmind would pause
scarce daring to look forward to the fceces
of blood and rapine, and of revolution,
which another year's war is likely to cause,
(hould France infill on her extravagant pre
tentions.
Eut when we perceive the situation of
France herfelf, the Directory paramount in
mod infta'nees againd all the wilhes and ef
forts of the affcmblies, and of the depart
ments, and raafter of the armies, what, is
there to exp|ft bjit war ? It remains then
only to be hoped that the crowned heads of
Europe, taught by a fatal experience, will
unite in one grand plan, to bring back the
redoration of order, and good and legal
government in France ; to reduce her to her
just bounds, -by which, and by no other
means can the peace and tranquility of the
world be eftablifh^d.
Should nothing occur before his Majesty
returns to town, which holds out the pcof
pÂ«ft of an honourablepeace to thi/j country,
we think that Parliament will be fommoned
to' mrt-t at <4 days notice, according to the
tertor of the aft passed at the conclusion of
the last feffioji, when Mr. Pitt will submit
the proportions made by the Direftory to
Parliament, and take the sense of the nation
on the wisdom of accepting or rejecting
them.
LONDON, Sept. 4.
The Tetter? and papers which we have re

other parts of Scotland, give the most dis

country, produced by the attempts wade
to put in execution the militia aft.
At Dumfries, at Moffatt, and various
other places, the fame discontents prevail.â
In the county of whieh the Duke of Ham

other parishes, have assembled, and voted

morning :
" Ed'mbucgh, Sept. I.
" I have this morning received a letter
from a gentleman who lives at Tranent, and
on whose veracity I can rely, giving an ac
count of a dreadful massacre c6mmitted by
fomt English cavalry upon the unarmed in
habitants of that village. The following is
an extraft: . y*
" Tranent,Auguft 30. âI would have
â wrote you last uight, but I waited till this
morning in order to obtain feller information
of thÂ« mournful tale of which you vvi(h to
know the particulars. We diftinftly heard
the firirig of the cavalry with their pistols,
which was uninterrupted for at lead twenty
minutes. There has been a dreadful busi
ness going on here, and the military have
behaved with a cruelty the mod (hocking.
Only three men and two women were killed
in the town ; âthe reft ran off, and were
hunted in various direftions into the fields,
and single men were (hot at the distance of
a mile "from the town. Several fuffered at
the village of Waeminow, and near Mr.
Dodd's house, being almost two miles to
the eastward of Tranetn. One young man
was pursued by two of the cavalryâhe ran
through a field of corn, ami was wounded by
one of them, and fell ; he rpfc, but was
soon (hot dead by the other. I have heard
of 16 ptople having been found dead in the
fields last night and this morning, and a

PARIS, August 27.
The following account of the celebration
of the aniverfary of the abolition fcf monar
chy, which took place at Wetzlaer on the
10th inft. has been published by Cherin,
head of the ftaff of the army of the Sam
bre and Meufe.
On the 10th of August last, at three in
the morning, a general discharge of artil--
lery "announced the fete which the army
whs that day to celebrate : a second dif-,
charge took place at five o'clock, and a
third at nine ; which last was the signal fqr
the army to parade iinder arms in front of 1
the camp. Adjutant generals Daltanne
and Simon were ordered to form, with the
whole, a hollow fquarc about the monu
ment 'raised in a plain behind the abbey of
Altembergâlt was an octagon pyramid
on a quarter base, and sacred to the memory
of the defenders of their country. On the
difffrent fronts of the base were the follow
ing inferiptions :
On the firftâ" To the manes of the
heroes who died in the defence of liberty
and their country !"
On the secondâ" To the republic tri
umphant !"
On the thirdâ" To republican fidelity!"
On the fourthâÂ«" To French courage,
and to vi&ory which attends it!"
The l eight fides of the pyramid bore
each an infeription in honour of the eight
divisions of which the army was composed,
in the following order and manner :
1. Gen. LÂ«febvr6's divisionâ" Like the
legions of Fabius, it swore that it would
conquer, and kept its oath !"
2. Gen. Grenier's divisionâ" It owed its
numerouj successes to its bravery and
prudence 1"
3. Gen. Championett's divisionâ" It asks
where the enemy is to be found, but
without ever thinking of enquiring about
the number !"
4. The artillery and corps of engineers :
for the formerâ" Like the Mailer of
the Gods, it hold the avenging thun
der !" For the latterâ" By th'efe for
treffes are destroyed, and with them ta
lents supply the want of numbers !"
5. The heavy cavalryâ" It moves only to
conquer !"
6. The huflar3â" They are always to be
found in the paths of honour !"
7. The dragoons-âWhat fignifies the
danger ? they know not what it is !"
8. The horse raHgers â" Their prcfenee is
enough to insure vi&ory f"
Above the inferiptions were placed buds
of generals Marceau, Stengel, Dugomier,
La Harpe, Banneau, Dampierre, and Du
bois.
At the last discharge of artillery, all
the general officers assembled at Wetzlaer,
marched out of town to repair to the camp,
preceded by martialmufic playing patriotic
â¢tunes : all the other bands were already
formed in the rear of their refpe&ive corps.
Gen. Hoche, the cbmmander in chief, made
a speech to the troops.
After the general had harangued the ar
my, it was drawn up in cwo bodies, when
a (ham fight took place on the very fame
spot where, when the fÂ»tne army was re
treating before the archduke Charles, the
brave general Lefebvre. at the head of
6oco men, kept in check 25000 Aullrians,
who already loaked upon him as their pney
âthe attack was commanded by the fame
general Lefebvre, whilst the poll attacked
was defended by generals Charopionet and
Grenier.
The troops returned afterwards to camp,
and to their refpeftive cantonments, where
refrefhmenta were prepared for them ; the
officer* attended the commander in chief to
the abbey of Al'erobcrg, where a plentiful
but' not a splendid dinner had been provided
for them ; the itioft affe&iifg concord, an
unanimity of sentiments the nioft alarming
to the enemies of the republic, the mod: pÂ»re
and open hearted franknefs, made the eater
tainment highly interesting even to -foreign
ers who had assembled from all quarters to
fee the celebration of the fete ; and where
Hanovarians, Auftnans, Hessians, and even
Danes, were indiscriminately mixed with
Frenchmen !
When the desert was brought in, the fol
lowing toasts were given and drank with u
niversal applause :
By gef*. Hoche, commander in chiefâthe
republicâ-may her old defenders contin
ue faithful to her ! May their courage,
which has triumphed over foreign enemies
annihilate every faftion at home.
By gen. Lefebvi'eâhatred to the enemies
of the republic ! Hedge firing to tbe ras
cals who fully the foil of liberty.
By gen. Championet âthe army of Italy !
We have heard your sentiments, brave
fellow soldiers, and'will march in front
with you.
