FRIDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 7.
ADDRESS,
TOT*! PRESIDENT 01 tmi UNITED STATES,
SIR,
A fundamental principle among Masons,
in their private assemblies, is, not to intro
duce the lubje& of politicks ; left, from a
difference of ientiment, the harmony of the
Lodge might bedifturbed. But, a maxim of
equal importance is conftanthr inculcated by
the brethren of the craftâto l>e willing and
obedient fubjeiSs to the government under
which they five.
ImprelTcd with the ft: (entiments, at a time
whenjealoufy is induftrioully propagated a
gainst our fraternity; the members of the
Grand Lodge of Vermont, affeinbled in am
ple form, composed of its officers, and a re
presentation from thirteen secular lodges,
under its jurifdiition, with that promptitude
which becomes true American citizens, beg
leave to expreli to you their moll entire and
unequivocal approbation of your official con
dutt (ince called to fill the chair of (late.
We rejoice, that, although your situation
has been delicate, and your public conduct
viewed with the jaundiced eye of distrust and
envy; yet that your wisdom, firmnefs and
decHion, have ftiengthened the affeftion of
Rour friends, and defeated the leditious ma
lunations of your enemies.
It is unnecessary, and may even be deemed
unbecoming men profefling universal philan
thropy, to enter into a detail of the unjust
aggressions of a foreign nation, upon our
country, uniformly disposed to peace, but
ever alive to unprovoked injuries.
Permit 11s, Sir, to fayâthat we glory in
our countryâthat we glory in being Ameri
cansâthat we feel an inviolable attachment
to that country which gave us birthâthat we
feel an attachment to our constituted author
itiesâand, especially, that we feel an attach
ment, an inviolable attachment, to our Chief
Magistrate. Let not the tongue of (lander
fay, that Masons are capable of fattion ! Al
though some among us, as in all Societies,
may fell their birth-right for a mess of pot
tage ; or betray their country for paltry pelf,
yet, be allured, Sir, that as a body, we are
determined to support our country's rights.
We are deterftiined to support our govern
ment. And, are deterniined, upon a tho
rough conviction of the purity of the motives
which have invariably diftated its adminiftra
tian, to risque our til in its support and de
fence. Can we fay more ?
Give us leave, Sir, to dose this short ad
dress, with the warmest aflurances of our
pcrfonal refpea ; aind to join, in one general
supplication to the great archited, the grand
Mailer aboveâto give you wisdom, to direct'
âstrength to endureâmd virtue to support
you> 'in the various dignified spheres of life, 1
through which, by your country, you may 1
be called to move; and, at last, intro-'
duce you to that temple above, a houie '
not made with hands, eternal in the heavens, t

ANSWER,
To the Member, of the Grand Lodge of Fret
Masons tn Vermont ajembledin ample form
tompofed of ttt officers, and a reprefentntion
from thirteen secular lodges*
GENTLEMEN,
I thank you for this obliging address which
has been transmitted to me as you dc fired by
his excellency the Governor of the state of
Vermont. I have ever esteemed the locieties
of Free Masons in this country, not only as
innocent, but ufeful.
The principle, not to introduce politics in
your private assemblies, and the other princi
ple, to be willing fubjefts to the government,
would if observed, preserve such societies from
suspicion. But it Items to be to be agreed,
that the society of Masons have discovered a
icience of government, or an art of ruling
society, peculiar to themselves, and unknown
nftt 1? / leglflators and philosophers
of the worldâl mean not only the (kill to
jknoweach other by marks or signs, - that no
other persons can divine ; but the wonderful
power of enabling and compelling all men
and I suppose all women, at all hours, to
keep a secret. If this art can be applied, to
set aside the ordinary maxims of the society,
and introduce politics and disobedience to
government, and Kill keep the secret, it mull
be obvious, that such fence and such focie
-hicTT t0 all the 111 purposes
which have been fufpefted. The characters
which cfenipou- the lodges in America are
luch, as forbid every apprehension from them,
and they will best know whether any dangers
are PÂ° ffible Â°? her countries as well as this.
1 he approbation you so obligingly express
of my official conduft, since called to the
chair of state, and your opinion, that it has
I fay cordially with you, let not the tongue
of slander fay, that Masons in America are
can lam it
cannot be said by any one with truth of the
Masons of Vermont. You have said enough
and the charadleriftics of candor, which ac
company your words, leave no room to doubt
of your fmcenty, that you will risque all, in
lupport of your government. And in these
pious and virtuous resolutions 'may the Ar-
C internal and Almighty have vou al
ways in his holy keeping-.

address,
To thePnEsiutNT 01 theUNi rEn States.
â ! WHILE th" communities, corporations,
towns, cities and legilhtures of your coun
try, are crowding to approach you with ad
drelTes of approbation and gratitude, will
you, Sir, permit the Legislature of the State
of Vein lout, to join the general voice ?
Among the latest to address, we would be
considered as among\ the foremoft to approve
your official conduct.
We have been represented as, a divided peo
ple ; but, this report has been fabricated and
cherilhed by thole, whole deftrmflive policy
would lead them firft to excite disunion, and,
like the incendiary, to profit by the confur
fion which they have created. That the
great bulk of oqr ejtizens aie firmly attach
ed to our excellent fedsr?l cpaftiuition.ofgov
ernnient, and highly approve its adrainiftra
tion, you may be allured, is an incontrover
tible fadt. That some men lhould not ap
preciate its advantages, or that some ihould
be bad enough to llrike at its very ey.iftencc,
is not ft range. When we consider govern
ment, as the afiociation of the honest, the
pious and the peaceable, to protect themselves
from the wickednels of the dilhonelt, impi
ous and unruly, it is not strange that, if the
beneficial designs of the former be effected,
the latter will complain, and attempt to
break every barrier which protects society.
We know ot no government, ancient or mo
dern, that was ever celebrated for its excel
lency, whose archives were not difgrartd
with the impediments of oppofuion ; and the
page of whose hillory is not stained, with
frequent infurreftions. Even under the di
vine theocracy of the Jews, the people mur
mured again!* plenty ; and, while their firft
magistrate was in immediate conference with
heaven, for their good, a stupid faction of
that poople, loft the remembrance of'their
divine government, in the adoration of a
molten God.
But you, Sir, can accurately diftinguilh,
between the voicfc of your country, and the
cl.uriof of party. We he ire offer you, Sir,
the genuine fentimenti of our conflituents,
the freemen of Vermont, as delivered through
their conflitutionai organ, the Legislature.
In the infancy tf French political refor
mation with our brethren of the United
States, we wi/hed well to the cause of French
patriotlfm, because we supposed it the cause
of virtue, religion, and rational liberty
But, when gallic vrtue, was succeeded by
licentiouiheisand i nfuni'in 1 tyÂ«â.\y hen religion
gave place to atheifn, and rational liberty to
grevious oppressionâ .when no longer con
tented with abortive ittempts to reform their
own government, thty boldly obtruded their
political creeds upon the order and tranquil
ity of other nations ; and with rapacious am- 1
bitipn, unknown to theirproudeft monarchs, ! '
dissolved ancient governments,. and annexed j '
plundered provinces to their own blood-stain- : '
ed territories ; when they violated the neu- 1
tral rights of the United Statesâcommis
sioned their ambassadors to excite us to so- '
reign war, and domestic infurreftion ; and "l
made the most unprovoked depredations on 1
our Commerce,âwhen they infultedour mef- 1
. Rogers of peace, and insidiously 1
to degrade them into the mean instruments, '
ot fubje&ing their country to a scandalous
tribute,âwhen they refiifed to Hop the hand 1
ot plunder, for a little period, while our gov- 1
ernment might attempt, by discussion, or 1
ccnceffion, to avert the calamities of war,â
Vhen they violently, and insidiously struck at
our national independence, every tie of af
feaiori for Frenchmen was dissolved; and
we clearly perceived, that we could no lon- '
ger be attached to that nation, "but at tfie
expence of our morals, our religion, and the
love of our country*-
Sir, this is a day which calls loudly for '
decision ; and we are proud to declare, our '
attachment to the conilitution of the Unit- '
ed States. We believe its prosperity deeply
involves pur own. We have the firmeft re
liance on the executive administration of our
general government. Your inftruaions to
our national envoy* to France, carry con
viaion with them, of your uprightnefsâ
our resolution, to fend no other envoys to
that haughty nation, unless previously assur
ed of their honorable reception, evidences, be
yond doubt, your firm attachment to the in
terest and honor of your country. You have
J U u y Â° Ur ccuntr y> the face of the
world ; and, if the consequence of French
duplicity and rapacity, (hall involve us in a
war, which we pray heaven to avert, we pledge
ourselves to our country, for ourfirmeft sup
port ot her violated fights.
Permit us, Sir, to add aflurances of our
personal refpea ;âwhile we honor you, as
our chief magistrate, we refpea you as a
man ; and it is to your glor v we can fay
âwe regard John Adams, because we love

I THANK you for your addrels of the

! A republic that is not bound by the laws

COUNCIL OF ANCIENTS,
29th Fj'udtuior.
The Council received a mefTage by which
the Dirtitory has yesterday apprised the
Council of Five Hundred of the descent of
the French army into Egypt.
" Europe is not fufficitnt," fays Lcmer
cier, to ierve as a theatre for our v iftories.
Africa mult alio behold the triumphs of the
children of France. The Nile waits impa
tiently for the presence of our valorous Co
horts, of the sons of viftory, who are to re
store it to itÂ« ancient splendor Without
doubt, this expedition, directed by genius,
connded to talents and courageâthjs expe
dition will be fully effected. The descend
ants of the ancient Egyptians will be aven
ged for the fpoilations to which they have
been i'ubjefted, and bring these beautiful
regions back to that Hate of civilization with
which they were formerly dignified. We
have as a guarantee the bravery of our War
riors :âlnflead of making from the firft of
their conquests, in this expedition, a new
Cipau, they did not remain in that liland
(which Ills refilled all the forces of Solyman)
only a fufHcient length of time to eni'ure it
irrevocably to the Republic, aud Immediate
ly departed for the' (hores where they were to
cull new laurels. Already they have aven
ged our mod faithful Ally, the Porte, on
the usurpers who had forgotten his authori
ty. Already have they avenged the French
for the insults and outrages to which they
have been expol'ed under the government of
the tyrannical Beys. They have at this time
opened again the channels of commerce, and
their fir ft tuccefl'es have already given free
dom to a part of tiie ocean."
The Council unanimouily approved the
resolution of yesterday, which declares that
the army of France, in Egypt, has deserved
well of its country.
We are much indebted to a mercantile
house in this city for the loan of a file of
Paris and Bourdeaux papers from the 21ft
Fructidor to the 3d Complimentary day (or
19th Sept.) received by the brigs Fox and
Endeavour, arrived yesterday from Bordeax.
I he lateneis of the hour at which we receiv
ed them, prevents our making full tranfla
twns from them for this day's paper. We
(hall be assiduous in feleiting from them all
that is interesting and worthy of detail for to
morrow's publication.
In the Journal de Bordeaux of the 20th
Sept. we observe that the President's com
munication to the Senate, relative to the ap
pointment of General Washington to the
command of the armies of the United States,
as also the General's acceptation ps it, is
known in France. That part of his letter
to the President in reply, which states his
ideas with refpeft to the condudt of the
French government towards this country, is
stated and publilhed by the editor of the
Bordeaux Journal.
Under date of Philadeluliia.â.l oth TJjer.

PARIS, 27 Fruftidor.
General Buonaparte has announced with
his own hand, his arrival at Alexandria to
Citizen Rullin, charge d'Affaire from the
Republic to Constantinople. Ruffin has sent
a copy of this letter to the diredlory.
i he director Rewbel has arrived at Paris ;
his health appears to be entirely re-established.
By the treaty of fub&dy concluded with
England, Russia has engaged to furnifh her
with 20,000 men, who are not to be employ
ed, but in Europe.

Tie uncertainty with rei'peft to peace, and
the movements of the French troops, has been

I homas Miffmn, Governor of the State
of Pennsylvania, met both H itifcs of the I

' calamity which had again, in the course of C
the last summer, aiflicted the metropolis of the ,

whereby in future to guard against this dread- \

patriotism and philanthropy.
TRANSLATION
Of the Letter from Lower Saxony,
September 26th, 1798.
(Continued) (
Roffeau has said,
" L'inexperience indocile
" Dll Compagnon de Paul-Emile
" Fit tout le fucces d'Annibal," I
but Roffeau has not obfeured the glory of the r
Carthagenian Hero ; the glory of Nslfon
lofesnone of its lullre in the known ignorance 1
ot the in-experienced marine over which h"
has triumphedâtheir poiition and their cou- a
rage might have supplied tlie absence of 4:11, t
liad he not rendered thatpoiition and courage t
ulelefs. What would have been insolent and
disastrous ralhncfs before an adroit an adroit c
antagonist, was in tlie ptefence of the French c
Sailors a wife and fortunate boldness.
It was in polling his squadron between the ,
French fliips and the batteries which protect
ed them, in the daring and unexpected ma- ,
ncevre of at once braving the dangers of the
coast and the fire of the enemy, it was in the .
midst of tliefe perils that Nelson conquered
and atchieved the mod triumphant victory
that ever graced the British Flag. It was by
the lame hardy tatties, never prattifed against (
fleets well commanded, and by the bold ma- r
noeuvres that Howe, Jervis, Duncan, and {
all thole admirals have triumphed, who for a
series of years have, *ach in their turn struck (
and humiliated the flags of the republic and /
he allies.
But Nelson has been still more hardy than
either ot themâThe fitnation of the enemy j
required him to be so, and the consequences j
of his triumph are beyond all comparison with
the success of the admirals whose viftories
I have noticed.
.IT is true that the emulation excited by '
one viftory produces anotherâand that a
Howe and a Lewis, covered with fortnne and ,
iionor, have created a Duncan and a Nelfim.,
sut triumphs, which have only won a few'
iliips from the republic which have not occa
sioned to it the loss of one essential man, (
>vhich have not fruftrated any of its great 1
projeas, ought not t0 be compared with a
vi&ory,' which may occasion the loss of Buo
naparte, and which may lave Egypt, India, (
Europe itlelf ; and the whole world from the 1
domination of the dire&ory.
Nelson has broken, before Alexandria, J
the sceptre of the Mediterranean, which the
French had seized at Malta, and from the '
moment in which this victory was atchieved,
all the advantages attached to the sovereignty '
of that sea, have been loft to Frarjteâadvan- '
tages which, in a course of years, might have
balanced the sovereignty of the ocean itfelf. ;
Yet if Nelson, in destroying the fleet of 1
Buonaparte, has only rendered to that gen
eral a service, which other great generals
have performed for themselves ; if his troops, <
having no possible retreat, are animated with ]
increased ardor ; if with their ulua.l valor,
they connect the courage of despair, if they
are reinforced by some thousands of men â¢-
laved from their fleet, and if every obstacle
should yield to the impettifffity of their unit
ed force ; if they (hould become mailers of
Egypt and the red sea, if they fliould march r
to india, or embark for that country under â 
the proteftion of a French squadron at the f
mouth of the ftreights of Babel-Mandcl ; if r
at length they (hould arrive in those regions r
which daily nourilh the fortune and the force J;
of Great-Britain ; and if they Ihould there .
subvert her power ; what advantage will (lie )
derive from the viftory of her admiral, and
to what purpose tends the glory of her flag ?
Such are the hypotheses now formed, and,
â n the doubt which is railed upon them, con- 1
lifts the consolation of the friends of the di
rcdlory, and the enemies of EnglandâFor '
my part, Sir, whose opinions are those of a
1 cofmopholite, and whom no one will accuse
of having difljuifed the danger with whichthe ,
expedition of Buonaparte threatened Eng- n
land and the independence of Europe, Ino h
longer entert.lin any apprehensions from that ''
General or from the expedition in which he is j.
â¢ embarked.
