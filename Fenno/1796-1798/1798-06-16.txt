Mr. Sewall, from the committee for

The quetlion was firlt taken on Monday,
and negatived 43 to 37.

Mr. Gallati\ hoped this bill would be
made the order for to-morrow, s.s the bill
had only been printed this morning, a.,d the
report but this uv-AeAt made. * It would be
a very extraordinary proceeding to make
this very important bill the oruer for this
day. *
Mr. I. Williams said th'i was a very
extraordinary cafe. When we learn every
day that our vtflels are taken by the'Fi'ench
crnilers, without any cattle wuatcver, it is
necrffary to att with piecilion. 1 his day
had been (pent 0:1 very trifling bufmefs com
pared with this, and he hoped the house
wouid fit until this biil was gone throw h
Mr. M'Dowell hoped tins bill would be
made the order tor to-morrow, as it had on
ly been laid upon the table this morning,
&few gentlemen had yet turned theirati<n:ion
to it. Besides the usual hour of adjiura
ment is arrived, and he hoped gentlemen
would not infill upon hMrry ng so important
a bill through the house in this manner. The
gentleman from New York remarked that
the house had been engaged in trifling busi
ness all the day ; but tic obfe-rved that gen
tleman I'iit vei y contented y under the dis
cussion, tho.igh he uâw fcems fo'defiroUi of
expediting this business.
Mr. SewALL was impressed with the ne
ceflity of palling this bill as fron as poffibK-.
If the lommittee had thought they mlMit
with propr ety have taketi time to deiiheratf
upon this fubjift, ti.ey would not have
made this report, but have taken into confil
deration the resolutions which had been re
ferred to them with this bi 1 ; but fir.dinr
it necuflfary that our armed vessels fhpuld re
ceive their inf!rations immediately, that
they may go out and take the vessels . n thÂ»
coast, or drive them off, they made th's re.
port, intending hereafter to report father
upon the subject. But the present
tlity thought necessary, from the peculiarity
of our present lituation ; the dangers attend
ingwhicb ibe people without fctmed to belully'perfliided if. And as thitfubjefthad
hieea ully difcufltd 011 the refol tions which
i.ao CKtyi before the house, he hoped the
bill would he immediately taken up ; as he
wished to provide without delay for the de
fence of our cast as far as our force would
permit.
Mr. M acon faidit was verv extraordina
ry indeed, that gentlemen should wifti to
hurry this bill through the house in the way
pjopofed. It appeared as if they' were afraid
of any thing coaling from our Commission
erÂ» before tliey got the cuuniry in war. Be
ing now the usual hour of adjournment, it
could not be expefted that if the house went
into this bill, that a >y debate could take
place. Indeed gentlemen seemed to wish to
prevent debate as much as poffihle ; a few
days a.ro, they had got a rule parted that no
person ftouU speak more than once to any
question. and now by moving to go into a
committee of the whole at the honr of ad
join â¢ ment, they wish to prevent them from
speaking or.ce, and that upon a bill which
JÂ»ill ceitainly place the country in a state of
war. Ke thought a reÂ«ard to decency ought
to prevent gentlemen from pushing this mo
tion.
Mr. Lyon called upon gentlemen to con
sider the importance of this bill. He con
fidtrcd it a 6 a declaration of war as it now
Hands, and he hoped time be given
to consider the whether some amendment
could net be introduced 'nto it, foas to pre
vent its being so considered. At present,
he believed, it was direfHy in the face of the
laws of nations. He was desirous of avoiding
war if poflible. His constituents also wilh
eii it He had received at lead 200 letters
requesting him to do all in his power to pre
vent it Indeed he was afraid of the con
sequences of war ; he was a I raid it might
produce even a diffolu ion of the present go
vern men'.
Mr. Brent was proceeding to express his
astonishment at the conduit of gentlemen in
w fhing to press so important a fubjeft upon
the Wife, when members were impatient to
adjourn, when
Mr. Sewall rose and withdrew his mo
tion, and the bill was made the order of the
day for to-morrow.
Mr. Harper laid before the honfe a let
tcr from the See etary of the Treasury to
the Chairman of the Committee of Ways
and Means, on the fubjeft of the land tax,
which v.aa ordered to be printed and the
house adjourned.

the United States resumed tbe consideration
of the bill ftipplementary to, and to amcud
the ait authorizing the President of the Uni

the amendment moved yesterday to confine
the loaning of arms to the Volunteers to field
pieces, instead of fmallarms and accoutrements,
came again under consideration, and was ne
gatived 41 to 54. Mr. Sew all then moved
an additional to the bill authorizing
the President of the United States when he

he may deem neceflary for the more fpe.edy
raising of the Provisional Army, whenever

motion was negatived 39 to 41. Mr. Bay

the Volunteers should not be compelled to
march beyond the limits of a State adjoining
to that to which they belong. This motion
was negatived theie being only 19 votes in fa
vour of it. Mr. Dayton proposed to far
ther amend the bill by adding the word " le
gions" so that the Volunteers may be termed
into legions, regiments or battalions. This
'motion was agreed to without objection or di
vilion. The committee then rose, and the

The underwritten inhabitants of the city of
Savannah and its vicinity imprefled with the
value of national independence, and of the wis

ernment so happily calculated to enfnre and pre
serve this blelhng, cannot withhold their appro
bation to the measures which you have pursued
at a juncture so critical to the United States, as
the present.
Fondly anticipating the reftotation of agood
1 understanding on principles compatible with
justice and honor, with a nation for whom AÂ»
merica had always manifefted sentiments of the
most real and undisguised friendfbip, they saw
with pleasure the departure of the commifiion
ers entrusted with this objedt, whose periona!
chancers juftified an entire confidence (and
which the event has proved not tohave been mif
-1 placed) that no suitable means would be neg
leÂ£ed in ptiffuingthe important-ohjedt of their
tnilTion. And notwithftandirg the painful and.
inexprefiible fenfajion which the conduct of men
at the head of a government once our allies and
friends excited, there remains a consolation, that
the cause and refpoufibility of this conduct
will reft *on themfeives alone. And it s with
great pleasure that we congratulate you Sir, and
our country on the wife and prudent measures
you have pursued for the preservation of p&ace
and the protection of our independence ; we
believe that you have done as much for the oh
tainment of the firft of these obje&s as a due
regard for the other would juitify or permit
and should the last argument of nations, a relort
to arms, become indifpcnfiblt far the prote&ion
of those rights whivb are the most dear to usâ
We pledge ourselves for the support of our gov- ;

and at the hazard of our lives and properties to

GENTLEMEN,
I thank you for this address, which as it comes
from a relpetflable portion of the ugion so re
mote from the feat of government, and exprefT
es sentiments, so noble spirited and patriotic,
has given me as much pleasure as any I haye
ever received.
Painful indeed, and inexprefiible are the sen
sations which the eonduft of men at the head of
a nation, once our allies and friends has excited ;
the refponilbility of their conduit mult reft on
themfeives alone.
I thank you for your congratulations to me,
and to our Country, and for your candid tefti
oiony in favor of the wisdom and prudence of
the measures pursued for the preservation of
peace and protection of our independence.
Peace and Independence, united have indeed
been my objects, and I rejoice in your opinion,
which corresponds with my own, that as much
has been done, for the attainment of the firft of
these objects, as a due regard for the other would
juftify or permit.
Reason is not heard, or if heard is despised,
and nothing within my knowledge remainsbut
the last argumentof nations.
The honorable pledge of your lives, and pro
perties for the support of government, and to
convince the world that you will take no lhare
iH the disgrace of being considered a divided
people, is very fatisfa<ftory and greatly to your

to prepare an address to the President of the
United States, in approbation of his con
duÂ£ in his negociations with the Republic
of France, and declaring the determination
of the people to fuppoit the government,
and the rights and independence of their
15 country.
t Whereupon the Committe retired, and
/ after some time returned, and reported the
following addrefp, which, was twice read,
a-.id linanimoufly adopted.
To the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES.
THE People of Talbot county, fn the
llate of Maryland, impr-fTed in common with
their fellow-citizens, wirh a lively sense of
the critical iituation of their public affairs,
feci it a duty which they owe to their cohh
try and themfeives, to address to you the
sentiments which the present occasion has
inspired.
We had hoped that the moderation, wis
dom and justice, with which executive
governmeut of the United States hath con
duced itfelf in its relations with foreign
powers, would have secured na fiom a par
ticipation in the war which lias desolated
Europe : It is therefore with extreme con
cern that we view the alarming position,
in which the nation is placed by the rapa
cious avarice and dcftrurlive projedU of
those who tyrannize over the people of
France. But fn the midst of this concern,
we defive abundant consolation from re
fleeing, that the mrafwres whicii you have
puafued for removing fubfi.'ling differences j
with the French Republic, have proceeded :
j from a liberal and fiucere difpofuion to re- ;
ft ore harmony, and preferva the important ,
i ate re ft s United States, without fa
crtficing ( the honor or fovemgnty Â«f their
government, and were ably and wifely cal- â 
ciliated to attain these ends, had your n go- J
ciations bren reciproc ted with th t spirit
of reconciliation and frieodfhip, which her ;
public agents have so often, but so pctfidi- I
ouily profefTed. We feel the keenest indig- '
nation in perceiving that these advances have
been treared with unmerited contempt ; and
that the ambitious dire&ors of this govern- j
mcnt, wholly abandoning the immutable â¢
principles ofjuftice,and equally disregarding |
the law of nations and the faith of treaties, |
have wantonly persisted in accumulating in
juries upon the commece and perfows of!
our citizens, and in vilifying, by the mofl j
scandalous insults, the executive authority â 
of the United States.
In such a state of things it becomes in
dispensably necessary, for a free people to
express their feelings, and to vindicate their
rights j and while we declare our entire con
fidence in your wisdom and integrity, we
aflure you, Sir, of our determination to
support every measure, which the present
crisis may demand, at the hazard of our
lives and fortunes, and to dellroy those ma
lignant hopes which have been entertained
from a vain belief, that the people of this
country are at variance with their govern
ment.
Animated as we are by the love of peace,
it is not without relu&ance that we con
template the calamities of war ; but resolved
to maintain the rights and independence
of our country, without the enjoyment of
which, peace would be only vassalage, we
ai*e fully prepared to await the events which
may befall us ; and if recourse must be had
to fhall-truft, under divine Provi
dence, to the justice of our cause : And un
der such auspices, we are confident that the
iflue will be fortunate, and be rendered
glorious by the wisdom and patriotifmof the
government, and by the courage and virtue
of the people.
Signed by order of the meeting,.
JOHN ROBERTS, Chairman.

GENTLEMEN,
THIS unanimous address from so re
fpc&able an aflembly of citizens, of such
various claflcs and denominations, conveying
to me the sentiments which the present oc
casion has inspired, does me great honor.
You fee that neither justice nor modera
tion can secure us from a participation in
the war which has agitated Europe. The
rapacious avarice and deftruftive projects of
those who rule in France, hr<s made wat
upon us already for yearsâa war all of one
fide, a war without reciprocity.
Our negociations have been conduced
upon public and national principles and in
terests, not upon little proje&s of the private
ambition, or avarice of individuals among
the rulers. Our advances have been treated
.with unmerited contempt; the question now
is, Will yon reverse your maxims ! and by
. gratifying the rapacity of rulers abroad,
teach your own future rules at home lefTons
of rapacity.
The executive authority of your country,
you may depend upon it, will be vilified,
by the most scandalous insults, by such ru
lers, as long as it is upright and pure.
Peace without independence, according
to your own happy expression, would be
vafTalage.

cessarily llruck in the memorial of the Â£om
mifiione s and envjys extraordinaty is the
method which they have thought proper to
purfuc in the statement of the points that
are in cot troverfy between the two states.â,
The Executive Direflory, animated with
the molt conciliatory difpolitions, impressed
with a sense of the interests that ought to
draw the two nations towards each other,
and e ger to concur i-i the well known with
of the people of both countries to main
tain a permit intimacy between them, had
reason to expeÂ£t that the Env ys would
have come forward with similar difppfi'ions
on the part pi their government, with minds
actuated wiih the lame views arid ftnpreffed
with the fame wilhes. How Â£reat, after
such an expectation, mud have been \he sur
prize of the Executive Direftory, when the
nnderfigned communicated to them a me
morial, in which the c mmiffiom rs and en
voya extraordinary, reverfmg the kn >wn or
der of fafts. hnve liudioufly palled over, as
it were, in silence the just motives of com
plaint of the French government and dis
guised the real cause of tie mifunderftand
[ ing which is prolonging itfelf between the
; two republics, lo that it (hould appear from
; that partial and incorreft flatement, that the
French Republic I.a no real gi iev nces to
complain of, no just reparations to require,
I while the United States (hould a one have a
right to complain, alone be entitled to de
mand fatisfatlien ?
The motives which have induced the pre
ference given to this mode of proceeding
have not e{ aptd the Directory. A&uated
by a proper sense of the dignity of the Re
public, whof* interests it is entrufttd with,
and wi(hing eventually to guard against the
views that have pointed out such a
conduct, it has given it in charge to the un
dersigned to dispel those delusive appearan
ces, which indeed must vanish before k can
did statement of fa&s and as soon as the reaf
intentions of the Dire&ory (hall have been
solemnly made to appear in oppbfition to
those views which could only be imjuflly at.
buted to shem by taking advantage of their
silence.
It is an inconteftible truth, which is en
tirely kept out of view in the-memorial of
the commiflioners and envoys extraordinary,
that France is entitled to a priority of com.
plaints and of grievances, that those com
plaints and grievances were real as well as
numerous long before the United States the
lea/l foundation for either, and confeqnently
before any of the faÂ£ts which the envoys
have so elaborately and minutely difcufled
had taken place.
It is a bo less inconteftible truth, that all
the grievances exhibited by the CommijTion
er3 arid envoys extraordinary, with forae
exceptions which the undersigned was rea
dy to difcufi are a neceflary coflfequence of
the measures which the prior conduct of the
United States had rendered juftifiable on the
part of the French republic, and which her
treaties with the said United States author
ised in certain cases which it depended up
on the general government of the Uuion to
bring or not into existence.
It is foreign to my purpose to enumerate
the complaints which the French govern
mont had reason to make against the feder
al government fiace the commencement of
the war excited against the French repub
lic by a power jealous of its pr fpcrity and
of its regeneration. Those details are con
tained in the numerou official communica
tions made at Philadelphia by the ministers
of the republic; they have been recapitula
ted by the pr deceffor of the undersigned,
in a note dated the 19th Ventofe, 4th year,
addressed ts the minister plenipotentiary of
the United States at Paris, and particular
ly detailed in the official note of citizen
Adet, d, ted at Philadelphia, the 2jÂ»h Bru
maire, sth year. Complaint was made in
the above note of the non execut on of the
only clauses of the treaties cfiC'uded in
1778 in which France had stipulated Aj>me
advantages in return for the efforts which
(lie had engaged to make for the common
utility, and of insults which bad been offer. "
ed to tJ-e dignity o* the French republic.
In faÂ£t, from the commencement of the
war. the American tribunals claimed the
right of taking cognizance of the validity
of prizes carried by French cruizers into
the ports of the United States. It reAilt.
Ed from this pretension, contrary to the let
ter of the treaty of commerce of 1778,
that the property of the citizens of the re
public was unjnftly detained ; that the
French were entirely discouraged from cruis
ing iu the American seas against an enemy
who was reviving the moll barbarous lawpi
of that mode of warfare, in order to l'nfult
and annihilate the Am.rican c immercc even
before the eyes of the federal government.
Nor was that government fatisfied with
favoring the enemies of the French repub
lic, in a point of so much a
point indeed, out of which some abuses
might have arisen, but which the French
government (hewed itfelf disposed to pre
vent âthey went so far as to grant to the"
fliips of thy enemy, contrary to the plain
lettcrof the above mentioned treaty, an a
fylumin the ports of the Uni'ed State? af
ter having captured property or velfels be
longing to French citizens. Soon after, a
natioi jl sloop of war, at anchor in the portof Philadelphia, was. seized and her com- i
mander arreiled by order of the govern- !
merit. In like mann r the person of the
ex-governor of Guadaloupe was arretted by k
proccfs from the American tribunals, to
answer a complaint founded upon fads re
lative to his adminidration. asd the execu
tive direftory wrrc obliged to threaten mak
ing use of reprisals before that atfair could 1
take the course whi' h was afligned to it by
the law of nations. During the whole
space of time of which a review has just
now taken, the French â¢ government
endeavored in vain to determine the govern
ment of the United States to procure to the i
agents of the French republic the legal
means of carrying into execution the arti
cles of the contolar convention of 1788,
which granted privileges to oar commerce
and navigation, the principle of which was
cftabh'flied by the treaties of 1778, and no- ;
thing could be obtained in this refpedt, but
fruitlefs references to the tribunals. In ge- j
ncral, all matters which, with a tr ly con- i
cilfat> ry difpolition, might have been fet
tled in the way of negotiation wer habit
ually referred o the judicial authorities, who
whether they were or not under a secret in
flurnce, did in the end either deprive the '
republic of ri his funded upon treaties, or '
modified the cxercfe thereof as fuitei the
fyfie r adopted by the executive.
.Such was the true (late of thing' in the :
m nil of . vugtift 1795, when the ratifica
ti nof a treaty of amity commerce andna- '
vigati in, fig cd a London in November '
preci'di u T , bet we n the United States and !
Great Britain, filled the measure of the ; '
g: iVvances of the republic.
What had been till that period the con- 1
dn.'fl ot the French government towatds the
United States ? The undersigned in order
to contrail it with that of the federal gov- 1
ernmerit, needs only recall to mind certain
fails which surely cannot hive been foro-ot- <
ten : 0 ,
Engaged in Furope by the mod pressing
concerns, the Republic had not direfled I
lier attention to the United 6tate> unless it
was to give them frefh proofs of the mod 1
sincere attachment and friendfliip ; (he It ft i
it to 1- er agents amicably to discuss, with '
the federal government, the controversies, a
iketc;i of which has just now been given, and <
which if they "had been met 011 both fides I
with a real fpiiit of conciliation could net I
have altered, to the present degree, the I
good tuiderftanding of the parties. Scarcely
was the Republic constituted when (he sent ]
a miriider to Philadelphia, whose firft (lep
was to declare to ths United States, that 1
they fhotild not be urged to carry into exe- *
cuti<jn the deferfive clauses of the treaty of I
alliance, although the exiding circumllances 1
were in the mod unequivocal manner within
the Qajus fmderis. Far from viewing this '
conduft in its proper light, the American t
government considered it as the acknowledg- (
ment of a right, and in the fame spirit the 1
commiiiioners and envoys extraordinary have 1
met this qucdion in the beginning of their <
memorial. Tbe minister of the Republic at r
Philadelphia, having given nnealinefs to the f.
American government, was recalled with t
readiness and his recall was attended with
circarn(lances bf ext:eme feveritv. His >
fucctiTt.-t carried to the United States all the t
repartitions that could be wi(hed for, accom- v
with the fincerefl arrd mod friendly a
declarations.âNothing can equal the spirit t
of concil ation. or rather condescension, in 0
which his inftruflions were drawn up in re- f
latioti to ever > point tiiat hadoccafioned any
uneasiness to the federal government, C iti- a
aen A (Jet, in the'name of the convention, e
corr borated those f xprcflions of good-will, Â»
arid that affeuibly itfelf received with the ef
fnfione cf an unbounded confidence and fin- a
cerity, the new minifler which the President t
ofthe United States sent to them, with the a
appa'ent intention of corresponding sincere- c
ly with the dispositions which the republic d
had never ctafed to evince. si
\et it will hardly be believed, that the tl
French Republic and her alliance were a/2- f<
wily facri/iced at the very moment when (he P
was thus giving to her ally iflcrcafed proofs 11
of her attention and regard, and that the h
co refp'indiug demonstrations of the Federal P
Executive hid no other view but to lull her c
and her government into a deceitful security. tl
It is nevei'thelefs well known, at this day, h
that it wis at that period that Mr. Jay, a
who had been sent to London, only, it was
then said, in order to negociate
refpeQing the depredations which were com- tl
mitted by he Briti(l> cruizers on the Amer- si
ican trade, was signing a treaty of amity, na Â«
' vigation and commerce, the negociation and c,
figriature of which had been kept a mod n
profound secret at Paris and at Philadelphia. â¢ o
That treaty was not avowed to our minider c.
plenipotentiary until the lad extremity ; and ei
it was communicated to him only for form's nr
fake, after it has been fan&ioned by t era- ti
Ufication of the Senate. When th agents ?<
â¢of the Republic complained of that myde- i 1
(jrious conduft they were answered by .an up- ei
pe> Ito the independence of theUmted States "
inlemnly eftablifhcd by the treaties of 1778; a
.a drange mode of defence againd a com- '1
plaint which the diflimulation which was u- of
fell proves to have been but too well ground- ti
ed i an iwfldious fubgerfuge, which to the P'
jpal point of the qnellion fubditutes a gen- te
eral principle, which the Republic could tl
not be fufpedted to controvert or deny, and jl
wliich by means of a sophism dedroys th t ti
intim.it* confidence which o>jht to fubfid ct
between two allie-, and particularly between c
the French Republic and the Untited
States. ha
If it is difficult todifcoverin thiscondudl I '
that which ought to be looked for from a P'
' frirnS, what (liall we th : nk of the treaty it
felf and of its provisions ? That treaty is at ru
this day knowntoal Europe ; and the small
ma|orities which gave it fanflion in both p<
house, as well as t*<e drong and numerous ed
expressions of the opinion of the People [5 1
againd it, are so many honorable teftimoui- ' u
ais in support i f the view which the I rench j. j
govei nmeiH has taken of it. The underGgn- m

1. tlaule has produced f;me inconveniences to 1
r the American flag. As to abufes,'which may ;
d j have an fen under the operation cÂ£that prin- ' Â°
e ; ciple, the undersigned again repeatsâthat â¢ f
he ivas rea v to dijeuji them in the mojl ami- 1
1- cable manner. c
e Fr irn this faithful exposition of the fafts c
T which have progn-ffivelv led to the pref nt
â  exiding inifunderftaitding between the two J
n Peepublics, it is evident, as the undersigned ,
:- observed in the beginning of this answer, c
that the French Republic were firft aggrie- 1;
g ved and that such of her measures as may '
d have given rife to the complai- ts of the J 1
t United States are, with a fewexceptions the
d natural confeqnenceof a dateof thingswhich ' e
:t it was in their power to produce or to a- f
h void. a
a If the undersigned, in setting forth the '
d complaints of the Republic (hould confine '
's himfelf to the treaty ofLondo'n, he would c ,
t but partially fulfil his duty, which direfls it
e his attention to further objeas. - g
y From the moment when that trca y vras j'
t put into execution, the government of the
p United Slates appeared to thick itfelf re- Â°
t leafed from the necessity of saving appear- e:
. ances towards the Republic Cl
f (handing the reiterated assurance which had tl
s been given to its miniders, that this treaty
a (hould make no change in the pre-exiding ft
j date of the neutrality of the United States, a
n the French cruisers were notified in the "
. courft of the year 1 796, that they could no ai
e longer, as had been theretofore prafticed,
e be admitted to fell their prizes in the ports t(
r of the United States. This decision was th
t made by the Federal Court of Justice, and
; grounded on the treaty concluded between "
1 the United States and Great-Britain.
1 . ilcwf P 5 P ers known tâ¢ be under the u'l
s indirea controul of the cabinet have, since hi
; that treaty, been doubly aftive in their in- ''l
. veaive and calumnies againd the Republic, V
j and againfl her principles her reprefenta
t tives, and ag;nts ; libellous publications he
, openly paid for by the Minider of Great-
Britail, haVe brought to view, under every 311
r Mlipe, thofc infttlts and those calumnies ; 00
. and such a fcandalotis (late of things never
( excited the attention of the government,
, who might have repress d it. On the con
. trary it was countenanced by the public
. aas of the government itfelf. The Exeeu
: tive Direaory has seen itfelf denounced in W
â  a speech delivered by the President in the
. course of the month of May (O. S.) as en
: deavouring to spread anarchy and divisions ]
fti the United States._ The new allies which
: the Republic has acquired, and who are the Pi
. fame who concurred in asserting the inde
: pendcnce of the Americans, have also been
insulted in official ccrrefpondences which M
have been made public, and in the newfpa
, pers. Indeed it is impoilible not to dif
â¢ cover in the tenor of the fpeechcs, and in
that of the publications which have been al
luded to, a latent enmity, which only awaits "
a favorable moment to break out.
Faas being thus placed in their true light,
it is disagreeable to be compelled to think
that the inflruaioÂ»s on which the commis
sioners have aCjed, have not bee . drawn up
with the sincere intention to proiuce a pa
cific result ; since far from grounding their foi
memorial on some acknowledged principles, ev
.or unconteded faas, they have inverted and f â 
coiifoundeel one and the other; so as to be w !
enabled to impute to the Republic all the
misfortunes of a rupture, which it appears j
to be intend d to produce by such a lin â  of
rondua. It is evident, th,;t the int-ntion
unequivocally exprcfled bf maintaining, at
every haznrd, the treaty of London, which
is the principal grievance of the Republic ; of
adh ring to the spirit which has produced
that tr aty and directed i s execution, and
of refufing to allow to the Repub ic any of /
the modcs'of reparation whicfi (lie has pro- lo;
(jofed ihrough tie und rligned, have diaa- ha'
ted those i ttrudtior.s., It is equally evident, fie
that there is no hifitation in facrificing to
foreign feelings, those which the trea
ties of 1778, and the rrcblleaion of the cir- re '
cumdances in ihe midst of which they were
concluded, ought to inspire. jj e
The rem te cynfequences of such a condufl ex
have not efeaped the atte: lion of the diredlory. Ps
It is wifteei, while nothing is omitted which can
prolong the mifunderfbnding, artd even encreal'e ' La
it, to throw on the republic, in the view of A
mtrica and Europe, all the odium of such a â-
rupture |
it is endeavored, to juftify by delusive ap- J
pearanceF, the prejudices which are difleminat- m(
ed at pleafnre .igainfl the repuolic, and the fyf- th<
rem of eiafperitiorl and alienationwhich is pur- rr!
sued, in rrfpeil to her, with.the moil unaccoun- la I

mating an Ultimate union with a power, towards tei
which a devotion and partiality are ihewu,which
f J lias lortg been tUMiI of the conduit of t?:e
n t Federal government.
_ j ' lc intentions which the undersigned attri
butes so tTie government of the* United States
are so li'tle d that nothing feerns to have i

e ; evident to every eye. It was prob ihiy with this

difpenfible, that he should, i?i the name of the

with which the complaints of the ministers of
the French republic have for five years part been
Inrrounded witlra view to weaken, mifrtprefent :

declaring their sentiments in an unequivocal man- j ,
per, to clear up evety doubt and everv farfe in
terpretation to which they might have been Tub- ,
jetted.
It is thereforeforc, solely with a view to smooth ;
the ivay to difittj/ion, that the undersigned has enter
ed upon the preceding explanations : It is with the ;
f;ime view that he. declares to the connniflionars ,
and envoys extraordinary, that notwithstanding
the kind of prejudice which may have been enter- ]
fair.ec'.with refpeÂ«ft to them, the executive dirv&o- '
ry are disposed to treat with that one of the three
opinions prefumcd to le more
impartial, promifeiu the course of explanations a 1
greater (hare of that mutual Confidence which is f
indifpenfibly required. The undersigned flatters <
himfelf, that this overture will meet with noferi-
ous opposition on the part of the commiflioners and j
-envoys extraordinary ;it fs the more natural to %
expeA it, as by ths tenor of their powers the said j
comrnifTioners and envoys extraordinary are au- a
tuorifed to negotiate jointly or separately ; so that j
nothing but the desire of precluding all acconSmo- c
dation could raise any objection against that mea-
sure, which moreover is merely pointed oat to the r
commiflioners themselves, rn order that nothing ,
may on this occasion have an unfavorable appear
ance, and which evidently has no other obje&than r
to fccure a h3ppy ifTue to the negotiation by rem- r
oving at the firli outset every thing that might, in
the course of that negotiation, awaken feelings J
that might eventually commit it.
The undersigned hopes .the cemmiffioners and
envoys extraordinary, will ioon ; enable him to in-
form the executive dire<flory of their determina-
tion. Whatever this deterrwination may be, the
undersigned flatters himfelf, that the explanation
he has given will have placed the fubjeA in its true
light, and may eventually serve to remove, in the
eyes of all impartial men, the unfavorable impref
â¢ Hon, which might be endeavored to be made res- c
peiling the intentions of the French republic and c
her government. n
He concludes by renewing to the commiflioners
and envoys extraordinary, the affnrance of his
confederation.

mendous and the manoeuvres plainly fcen,
after palling and repaffipg each other. A
third velfel lay to about a mile to the north
ward, during the whole engagement, which
continued till about half p-;ll feveu, when
the comba ants lay with their heads to he
land, apparently about two cabl s length
apart ; the wind weftwardly, and very light.
9th. a. m. This morning one large fltip,
and several small vessels appearing to be
coaders, returning home, were in fight ;
the Writers sloop soon after came to the in
let.
It was mentioned some time ago, that the
Whig Club of England had resolved to pre
sent General Kosciusko with an elegant
Sword. This honourable mark of refpeci
was placed in the hands of Mr. King, our
Minilter in London, for the purpose of for
warding it by a careful hand to the General in
this city. Captain Lee, of the Adriana, lately
arrived at this port, was the bearer of this
handsome present, which is made in the form
of a Sabre, ftiperbly mounted with gold, and
ftut'ably inferibed. The General beingat pre
sent in Virginia, availing himfelf of the salu
brious Springs of that State, Captain Lee has
not been able to fulfil the extent of hiscon
million ; but we underhand, that on Thtirf
day lafl he consigned it to the cafe of Thomas
JefFerfon, esq. Vice President of the United
States, who has undertaken to deliver it per.
fonally to the brave Veteran on his return to
Virginia. This Sword, we are told, cod Two
Hundred Guineas.

MR. FENNO,
There is a mod ample display rf the
" Diplomatic Skill of France," in Baclu's
Aurora * f this morning. Talleyrand' in
fidions letter in anfwtr to the memorial of
our Knwiys, with the circumdances under
which it has made its appearance through
Bache, mud convince every person that the
French have a parly in this country.
The are determined to divide
arid conquer. They hare pursued this po
licy with great success in Europe, . nd they
are pursuing it here by all the means in their
power. I pray to God their dratagems
inay be defeated ! This mftdious paper
mull have been sent by Talleyrand to some
of his secret agents here, that it might be
thrown upon ihe people in a manner mod
favorable to the views of the Directory.
AMERICAN.
MR. FENNO,
What better proof do we want of the di
plon-atic (kill of FranceâTh? document
this day published in the Aurora, was received
the day before y derday, in French, toge
iher with an anfwtr from our commiflioners,
which is voluminous. The clerks have
been engaged in translating one, and copy
ing the otherâBut behold mader Ben, has
a tranflatiori cut and dried, which was. for
warded to some Gallo-American agent here,
to be circulated without its answer. The
vaporing document contains nothing brit
what has been better said by Adet and oth
ers times without number ; but it is well to
remind the people on all occa!io 9 ( f the
lleady adherence of the French to
fyflem of dividing the people from the gov
ernmentâarid it is ufcful to pay attention
to this faft, as it fu.rnifhes the mod indubi
table ar.d flagrant pr. of of the traiterous
correspondence maintained by their fpiee
here.
FOtt THE GAZETTE OF Tl,Â£ UNITED STATES
QUERIES,
Addrefled to the people of America, by
one who has as little intercourfcwith the ;
office of the Secretary of State, as with
the office of the Aurora.
1. Can there be a more complete proof
of the exidence of a faftion in our country,
holding a traiterous correspondence with
France, than the publication of an " impor
tant State Paper," as it is called in the Au
rora of this day ?
2. By what pofiible means can ii be sup
posed such a paper, if it be genuine, could
have come into the hands of any ir dividual, !
? ir. his private capacity, unit ft by t.-atifaif
fiort fivia the fjovernment of France itfilf,
or f.'om our env.iyt >
~ 3. Can tbeJaticT be fuppofjtd to hold cor.
refpondente with Bachc, or KTs office i
4. Is hot thai Paper obviotifty intended
as an appeal to' the people of America,
agai 11 their own government, and " art
endeavor to spread anarcby and diWfions in
the United States ?"
r 5- I s there any other flandar l, than our
, jr" v crhineflt, aroiir.d which the Americsri
H people can rally, in defence of O'.r indepen-
device, our liberties, our properties, and slf
our internal political and civil Mitmfons ft r
ftcuring and promoting the means of hap
piness ?
. not 'be conciliatory difpefition
shewn in this important (late paper, and
n the manner m which it has been ulhered
. forth to the views of the world, perfedly
f analogous to that which was lately (hewn to
Switzerland ?
e I 7. Were not the Swiss held up to 113
s lately by an agent of France as a pattern
of " the exaft observance of treaties," and
as a people " whof. refpeft for the law of
_ r.ili ns could not be doubted i"
( Adrt to Pickering March 11, 1796,
. No. 129 in docum-ii'6. Piclcringto
r 8. What has bten the result ot that
' " conciliatory disposition" with regard to
, t ' le Swiss, notwithilandinjg their exa'ft ob
| fervance of treaties and rcl'petl for the law
of natii rts ?
9. Was t rot to prevent tTieir taking ef
. fec'ual ir.cafitres of defence; till France
pi flvuld be prepared to (liike a blow at once
r fatal to a great po lion of their mod valu
able citiz.-n-, to their iirlependtnce as a
people a-:d to a government wtirch for the
freedom and h ip'pmrfc it difFul'ed amongll
_ 1 sow.) citizens, and for itÂ«pacifi-j and up
right conduct towards other na ions, had
, long been the bosft of liberty and rcpubli
, canifm in Europe ?
( 10. Ought not their fate and the like n->
fidious attempts, aided by traitors amongJt
us, to rouse us in d fence of our country,
| that name which was so cltar to the antfcnt
, Spartans, and which it is hoped will be not
less dear to the Americans of this day ?
Some further queries upon the particular
merits of this Important State Paper will
be submitted to the cofifederation of my fel
low-ciiizens.
