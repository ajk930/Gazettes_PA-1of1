' I have seen, gentlemen, in th" public
! prints of this city a piece finned " A S.ificr- l ar
I ing Merchant," and talten from your par.ei* ne ,
of Nov. 6th. I know nothing about the
olijeft of this, pulilicfltion ; l>nt its obvious co
tendency being to induce a belief in the.po
pie of this country, that the captures of
their property by the French, proceed not ; n
from the injustice of that nation, but from m;
the negligence of our own go.vernmefit, I l e t
have thought it proper to udtl.-t.fs a few re- ra j
- marks to you on the fubjeft j and I reqticft j'
the favour ,of you to republish them in your V e
I Gazette. ' Â«<
This writer Rates that the English part re
, of the fea-letter,given to our vessels pursuant (",<
â  to the 25th and 27th articles of our com
: mercial tj-eaty with France, is not a jnfl
' translation of the French part; and this is on
the negligence on the part of Â®ur govern- w j
ment, which he supposes may have given ; n
II rife to the depredations of the French. efi
1 But it is to be remembered that the jp C
( French part is also inserted in the sea-letter, iti 1
0 which ismade cutin four languages, French, tii
Spaniili, English and Dutch. This French j n
part is precisely cÂ»uforinable to the model th
annext to the treaty ; and as that is the te
part particularly addrelTed to the French
- crnifers and ships of war, whose command- e x
ers are not luppofed to underltand Englifli, 0 j
surely the variations in the other part ean- of
â not be material as it refpefts France. F
n To put this matter in a clearer light, I aj
n woold a/k whether a fca-letttr, in which the in
'â¢ French part (hould agree with the fcJrm an- (J,
ne<t to the treaty, ajd tb- Englifli, Span- la
_ r ifh and Dutch parts, or either of them be gl
1 wholly omitted, could be objc&ed to hy y,
s . France ? certainly not; tor the treaty (im
ply requires that there should be a sea-letter
conformable to the model annext, without
declaring that it shall be iij. this or that lan
guage. But surely il the English part might
be altogether omitted without invalidating ei
f. the sea-letter, it cannot be affe&ed by any si
d irregularity in that part, while the others o
J 6 are in due form. c
,* This idea is further confirmed by obferv- d
1. ing, that the treaty, though executed in h
fe French and English, is expressly declared to f(
je have, been " originally composed and con- a
'' eluded in French." Hence when any dif- t!
pute arises about its confirmation, the French h
is always recurred to, and the meaning of p
' the terms is fixt according to their scale in fc
â  x that language and not in English. t
ee The main objeft of the treaty, moreover, a
in this part Qf it, is to provide a mode of I
, proof by which, ta use its own words, it f
may appear " that the vcdel belongs real- 1
in ly and truly, to the ef one of the }
e > contr&fliug parties." In order to accom- ]
| 4 ] pi ifh tlÂ»iÂ« mhjed, the, article flipulates, " that 1
in cafe either cf the parties should be en
a, gaged in war, the vefi'cls belonging to the I
m fubjedfs or people of the other ally, fliall be j
, n furniilied wiih sea-letters or paflports, which 2
of shall express the name, the property, and the i
"i lurthe.-i of the vefiel, as well as the name and t
lv ' rtfidence of th* matter." And this pafTport 1
- it adds, (hall be made out according to the :
form annext. Here it is obvious that the ,i
use of the patTport is to ascertain the prop- i
erty, and that the material parts of it are the <
name, property and burthen of the Jhip, and the i
\d, name andrefidcmc of the matter. Not a word 1
l is said about a lift of the crew, or a role
?i _ (Evquipage, which was in no degree neceflary
ao- to this objeÂ£t ; and the annext form was re
ncs i ferred to not as a precedent, which mud be
ic " | cxadtly copied, but as a model, a diredtion
to point out the manner in which this pass
- port should be drawn up.
This was evidently the light in which
e< *> Mr. Jefferfon viewed the matter ; for in the
"j originul eopy, annext to the treaty, there
or are several alterations in his own hand-writ
to ing made by him while Secretary of State,
ipt. in order to accommodste the model to the
on- fty] e Q f ol]r govetnment.
,lfr Now it will be found, by referring to the
Englith part of the patTport as slated by
your correspondent, that, although nat an
for exaÂ£t copy of the French part, it neverthe
tnd less contains all the above mentioned mate
ot- rial points, the name, property and burthen of
the veffcl, ar.d the name and residence of the
S. matter. Consequently it complies fubftan
v tially with the treaty* to the benefit of
_ which, even (landing alone, without the
French part, it would be fufficient to enti
tle our vetTels.
T ct The part omitted relates to the lift of the
s crew, and fecurityto observe the marine or
v dinances, without which formalities no
French vet Tel, according to the laws of
France, could obtain a clearance in the ports
of that country. These cireumtlances,
therefore, were naturally mentioned in the
, ee . French part of the sea-letter, because with
rom' out them the sole objeÂ£t of the paper, viz.
>rta- the proof of the vet Tel being French proper
110ft ty, could !iOt be accomplitlied, nor any patf
iri:a' port given. But it would have been idle to
'fore in^'CTt 'hem into our part of the fe?.-letter ;
| lc i r because our laws required no such iarmali-
IriCi ties. In order to obtain a clearance or
vrl 7 patTport among 11s, no lift of the crew, nor
Â»telfc 2n y ftcurity to observe the marine laws,
â¢ were neceflary ; and theiefore it would have
V.r's been fool: ill to talk of them iri tU< sea-letter.
;Icrs In (hort the tea-letters and pafTports of
:e-n's each natiun date the circumftaoces refpedt
:c of ively necessary, by its laws, for proving the
rulfe p ro P- rt y vetTels ; but through great cnu
edi. tion, and the mote completely to avo.d dis
putes, our sea-letters conta'n both forms,
J ar - our own and the French : if the firft be de
c,.?' ficienr, surely it may be supplied by the fe
.J.'âr cond. Â»
As to the role d'equi''age, which your
f correspondent tpeaks o.', I would obterve,
that no such thing is required, or even men- sot <
tioned, by the treaty. The form of the this
sea-letter Hates that the captain " (hull enter ( lives
in The proper officei," a lift of, his crew ; but Mop
this entry is to be made in the office where infu
he obtains his pnffport, and notcarried with den'
hirrv to sea ; and if this regulation referred! fed
to our vt-dcls, which evidently is not the whe
cafe, still the passport itfelf would be proof din j
that all the V'quifite formalities had been Atr
complied with before it was granted. vide
The marine ordnance, of France, particu- the
larly those of 1704 and 1744, require that adn:
neutral vefTels in time of war shall be furnilh- peo
ed with a lift of the crew and pafiengers, tho
containing their names, place ofrefider.ee. con
Sea. This lift they call a rolf d'equipage, fori
But their commercial treaty with us, made the
in Febeuarv 1778, dispenses with this for- ed 1
nudity by.cxprefsly declaring that the sea- trai
letter and paiTport lha'l be fufiicient, and o- diai
to make any mention of the role fha
d'equipage. In July 1778, the French go- the
vernment pnblifhed a regulation refpefting poi
" neutral vefTels in time of war and this wh
regulation repeats and/.nforccs the provi- pat
lions made by former ordinances concerning .
the role d'equipage. yoi
But this regulation, which was the aÂ£l of ha]
one party alone, coul 1 not alter the treaty, be
witout the consent of the other: nor was it wil
intended by the French to produce any such coi
cfFeÂ£l ; for it is expressly confined, in its o- to
1 peration, to "neutral vefTels navigating in, wil
j time of war." The United States, at that vig
i time, were not neutral : they Were engaged an!
in the war, on the fide of France ; and I
therefore this regulation could not have eon- thi
templated them. Tl
This fubjeel, of the role d'equipage, is afli
extremely well explained in a decision of one fat
of the French admiralty courts on the cafe wil
of the brig John,' which was captured by a IN
French privateer for want of a role d'equip- Bu
age. This ground of capture was declared of
infnffii;te,!!t, and the brig wasacquittrd. The To
decifidn m,Â»y be found at length in the Phi- th<

CAROLINIENSIS. vi<
From tie Columbian Centinil. Tl
Ms. RUSSELL,
The spirit of jacobinism is secret, influ
ential, and penetrating. Dark and uncon
fined in its operations it tends to a complete
overthrow of every moral and political prin- E:
ciple.âlt gathers new strength from every
defeat, and like the hydra of old adds one
head more to the number it originally pos
sessed. It changes repeatedly its manners ab
and means, but the objefts arc universally lie
the fameâdeath and ambition. Its effefts tri
have almost exceeded belief. The wisest fu
politicians of Europe and America have been wi
baffled in their calculations. It was thought uc
lo be a meteor which would frighten only for
a moment, and then dwindle into thin air. D
.But it has converted Europe into one vast n e
scene of blood. Under the fscred namrÂ» of T
liberty and the rights of man it has either
humbled or fubjugatcd Holland, Auftna, he
Italy and Sfain. England has felt its tr
dreadful eS'efts, and even the crescent of 'h:
Turkey bows as it approaches. Without a di
shadow of pretence or declaration of princi- w
: pies, it has overturned conflitutions, whofc ta
1 antiquity and excellency entitled them to re* m
fpeft, it has violated all obligation, destroy- f
I ed the social feelings and the numerous re- E
t lations which fubfilt between man and man, (J,
: and threatens to convert the whole world /)
: /into a scene of bloodshed, wickedncfs and w
- unirerfal disorganization. Where these tl
e dreadful scenes nil ft end is beyond the re- C(
; searches of (hort figbted reason. We had a
1 lately cause to hope that the war was ad- c
-1 vancing to a condufion. The negociatious J (
f at Liflc and Udina, though covered with f
- mystery and secrecy, it was thought would tl
e have a favourable termination. But in 0
n France things fuffercda total revcrfion.While
- peace and order were the unanimous wi(he3 a
of the French People ; while Pujloret was tl
h pleading the cause of insulted America, and /
e Boiffy d'Anglos amusing himfelf with ideal c
e hopes, three of the Dire&ory with the true n
:- spirit of 'Jacobinism, proscribed two of their tl
own body, sixty of the councils of Five 1
e Hundred and of Elders, and thus has fled e
all hopes of present tranquility. c
e The views of Jacobinism have been direst- n
y ed towards this country ever fincÂ« the close 2
n of the late war. Under a policy peculiar to c
its charadler, it has affumcd various appear
:- ances. Sometimes engaging, subtle and nn- ] ;
jf afliiming, it wiflied to charm us into a fatal q
ie security, that we might become an easy prey f
1- to its infernal intentions. At other times j
sf threatening, bold and decisive, it wished to b
ie frighten us in'o a man compliance with it 3 e
i- views. But the guardian angel of freedom
has hitherto protected us from danger. Men *
ie and measures have been weighed in the ba- c
r- lance, and have not been found wanting.â r
10 WASHINGTON, HAMILTON, A- f
of DAMS and PICKERING, have guided r
ts our councils, have ftctnmed the the torrent t
s, of fadlion, aadglorioufly diredled us through 1
he the whirlwind of war. (
h- The late revolution in France mull have <
z. a decided efftil on American measures. Our i
;r- envoys will either be received and matters j
If, arpicably adjusted, or they will be treated i
to with contempt, and wa# betthc iiltemative. {
r; If (he so rmcr flioiild happen, we then will ;
li- carry on our own matters in peace and fecu- 1
or rity, free from the detentions ar.d adjudica- '
or tions of the Britli 1 ), and the unjuftifiabk j
IS, vexatidns of the French eorfairs. If the 1
ve : latter be the laG re Tort, Americans arc vea
,*r. dy for the cor.test.
of j Though in the beginning we had wiflied 1
fl- j to live secluded from the bullies of the world
he and had hoped to view the distant troubles
;ii- I of Europe, like the traveller, who from
if- , some uniiiaken piomontory surveys the fury
as, 1 and efiefts of a sea storm, yet if we are
Je- â  dragged into the contest, we will never be
fe- | wanting to ourselves and our country. A
] mtricatis know what are the rights of free
Â»ur â  rnt-r. k and thofevrights they will maintain
ve, ti:::rapuir-.dcr die in maintaining. They do')
m>t wifli the fcenii of Francs renewed in m
tli is country. TU;y will never hold their w<
lives as gifts from any nat'on, especially from ca
b'opd-thirfty Frenchmen ; from men who so
insulted aud spit upon our venerable Profi
cient ; who infringed or.r neutrality and rai
sed an alarming rebellion in our country, C
who have nt'vef ceased persecuting, degi'a- w
ding and reviling the American name, and ar
American meafivres ; told lis we were a di- ns
vided nation, and threatened to appeal from cc
the adminillration tel the people, as if the lo
adminiflration was not thefree choice of the ec
people. Yes, Americana) Frenchmen are â¢
those who now capture and condemn Vour
commerce and fellow citizens without the
formalities of trial ; who tlonbtlefs are at Â£
the bottom of Blount's confpirucy, inllruÂ£t
ed the Spaniards to withhold the po!ls con
trary to the Treaty ; tampered with the In
dians on the frontiers, and advised them to D ;
sharpen their tomahawks and make ready
their arrows for war, who have poured u- j
pon you the viletl torrents of. ahufe, and g
whose crimes, villainies and perfidies are un- g
paralleled in the hillory of nations. S
Such, citizens, are the men with whom v j
you have to deal. Oft your condudi, your t(
happiness or misery depend. If you viifhto
be ftp'ckzn with poverty and overwhelmed t,"
with taxation, then like the Hollanders, be
cow rdly, fertile and mean. If you with t |
to secure tranquility to your country, or die a!
with glorious expeditions, then be sober, \ V
vigilant and independent, like the inhabit- g
ants of Switzerland. I trust you are men.
I hope you will prove yourselves wor- u
thy the cause in which you are engaged.â ]y
Then your altars will not be violated, the C(
allies and mouldering bones of your fore- :']
fathers will not be thrown into the air, nor
will the grey hairs of your beloved WASH- 0
INGTON, wave on a pike to the wind, p
But, calm and colledled, the descendants a
of the heroes of Bunlers-Hill, Trenton, and u
York-town, will move to the field, and like
the old Sword of WASHINGTON, 0
brightened in the blood nf your enemies, h
will gleam in the air, and like the plume of p
Henry the fourth, guide you to glory and g

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES..
MONDAY DECEMBER 4.
Mr. Josb p hH e I ster, from Pennfylva
pia (in the place of Mr. Ege) appeared and
| took his oath and feat.
Mr. Gregg, from Pennfylvani'a, Mr.
Skinner, from Maffiichufetts, Messrs. Bur
gess and Eryan, from North-Carolina, Mr.
Sampler, from South-Carolina, and Mr. Da
vis, from Kentucky, made their appcaranee
to-day.
Mr. Coit, from the committee of Elec
tions, reported on the memorial of Robert
Rutherford, complaining of the undue elec
tion of General Morgan, that they had ex
amined the proofs adduced, and that they
were wholly inefficient to support the alle
gations contained in his memorial.
Mr. Coit moved that the house concur
with the report ; but upon the wishes of
MeiTrs. J. Parker and T. Claiborne, it was
committed to a committee of the whole for
j Thursday.
j Mr. Liviscston, from the committee
of Commerce and Manufactures, made re
ports on the petitions of John C. Normand
and Henry Sherriot, who prnyed for the re
mission of duties on wine destroyed by fire.
The report Hated that there was no doubt
of the fact being as set forth ; but that the
house had frf late years rejefted all such ap
plications,not only as inequitable, but on the
ground'of its beingimpoffibleto guard againfl
imposition, and therefore referring t/> former
deeifions, determine the prayer of the pe
titioner could not be granted.
Mr. L. also made a report on the peti
tion of Frederick Cyru3, praying to have
the management of a mining scheme, ftatinjr
that, as the committee knew of' no such
plan, and the house had no power to make
the appointment, the prayer of the petition
could not be granted.
The house concurred in these reports.
Mr. Dwight Foster presented the pe
tition of Thomat Carpenter, dating that he
was editor of the American Senator, pub
lilhed during the last session of Congress end
ing in March last ; that at the commeitce
raent of that session he presented a memorial
to the house, praying its support of his
work ; that the house had declined sup
porting it as a body, but jeceiving individu
al aflarances of support frorrt many of the
members, he had been induced to engage in
the work ; but tTie event had proved unfa
vourable to him ; he hoped now, therefore,
that he (hould be recompenced by the house
engaging to take three copies for each mem
ber of the work he proposed to publish this
session (provided he met with the support
he prayed f >r) which, computing the session
at eighteen weeks, he supposed would not
amount to more than 2 2jo dollars.
Mt. D. F.Mier'moved that this petftion
be referred to a ieleft committee. Mr.
i Coit objefted to a reference. The house,
he faidj had so often determined to have
1 nothing to do with the publication of the
: debates, that he thought it time to have
: done with the ftibjeft. He hoped, there
fore, the petition might Be upon the table,
f Mr. Foster and Mr. Thatcher spoke in fa
t vour of the committal ; and the motion was
put and carried, and a committee of three
, members appointed to report thereon,
f Mr. Goodrich presented a petition from
. the Deputy Postmaster of Hartford, pray
: ing for additional compensation. Referred
; to a feleft committee.
5 Mr. W. Claiborne prefer.ted n petition
f from sundry citizens of the state of Virginia,
t complaining of being aggrieved by the aft
- laying duty upon ftiils, and praying relief,
j Mr. Claiborne was doubtful as to what
: committee this petition ought to go ; he
1 thought it best to go to the committee of
wayS and menns ; but on bring informed no
; such committee was at present in exigence,
- and Mr. Harrifon wilhing the fubjeft to go
: to a feleft committee, he consented. Mr.
New thought it waald be best to appoint a
- committee to enquire what amendments
- were neceflary to the aft. Mr. J. Parker
was in favour of a committee of ways and
- means; and Mr. Nicholas moved that a
e committee of ways and means be appointed.
A Committee of Ways and Means was
n accordingly, appointed, and confided of the
I following members, viz. MefT. Harper,
- Gallatin, Grifwold, Blount, Hofmer, Craik,
il Brent, A. Folter, Sewall, Morris, Davis,
Sinnickfon, W.C.Claiborne, Bayard, Cham
â - plin, and Baldwin.
x M:\ Sitgreayes presented the petition
e of Abraham Jokes, a brevet captain in the
e war, praying for the pay of a captain, tor
d which he ftatcs h;mfe! c entitled. Referred
;f to the core mitres of Claims,
f* Mr. Dwig ht Foster moved tint the
:s committee of claims be discharged from the
j- further confideraVon of the petition of
i- John Liyman, which had already been more
re than once reported and decided upon. A
it ' greed, and that he have leave to withdraw
ic his petition.
>f Mr. W. C. Claiborne presented the
> remonstrance and petition of the Legislature
if of the date of TenefTee, complaining of the
iiv cxtenfion of the boundary of the United
ve States into the Cherokee country; of the
11- proclamation of col Butler, requiring all
e- persons fettled upon the land included in the
u. boundary, within a verylhort space, and at
c- an inclement season, to remove therefrom,
he by which nearly 3000 persons, had been
t- greatly diilrefi'ed ; of the conduit of Mr.Hawkins, See'. prtyiiij relief.âReferred to
a feleÂ£l committee;
Mr. 0 tis moved that the pstition of
Samuel Moore, of Boilon, praying sb be rs
imburfed a certain ftim of money which he
ftatcd himfelf to have been robbed of, pre
fetrted.laft feflion, be referred to the Secre
tary of. the TreasuryâAgreed.
Mr. Sitgreaves said, he was prepared
to make a report from the committee ap
pointed at thelaft fiffion, to fit during the
recess, for the purpofeof collecting evidence
and substantiating charges againll William
Blount a Senator of the United States, im
peached of high crimes and mifdemeauors ;
but as that committee was appointed arid
received its inftruations with closed galleries
he supposed, except the injun&ion of secre
cy were taken off, it would be neeeffary that
the galleries (hould be closed whilst tha re
port was npade, thpugh the committee were
of opinion there was not any thing in the re
port, which ought not to be made public.
He therefore moved that the report Ihould
be received in the usual way.
The Speaker read the rule of the house
on this fubjedl, and said, he did not think
any motion neeeffary, if the Committee
were of opinion, secrecy was not neeeffary.
Mr. Thatcher thought it was neeeffary
th it the iijunftion of secrecy 6ught to be
taken off before the report was made.
Mr. Sitgreaves made a motion to that
effeft which was carried. He then present
ed the report, which the clerk proceeded to
read.
The Committee state that soon after their
appointment, they received a trunk from J.
Rofs, Esq. containing sundry papers be
longing to William Blount, which had been
seized lÂ»y order of the Senate. From these
papers, they made a feleclion, and returned
the remainder to W. Blount. A violent
presumption arose from the perusal of the
papers, that Nicholas Romayne of the city
of New York, was intimately conne&ed
wish Mr. Blount ; the Committee conceiv
ed it to be their duty, therefore to prevent
'the escape of N. Romayne, by feenring hid
person and papers, and issued a writ for that
purpose, the execution of which they placed
in the hands of the Secretary of State, who
made capt. W. Eaton, messenger on the oc
casion. On the 12th of July, the messen
ger returned with Nicholas Romayne, and
a number of his papers (fueh of which as
are material are reported.) Having finifh
his examination, N. Romayne gave security
for his appearance before the Senate on the
trial of W. Blount.
A letter signed James Grant, found a
'mongft W. Blount's papers, and the letter
from the latter to James Carey, made it ne
eeffary to secure their persons and papers.
Major T. Lewis was employed to do thebu
finefs. He was also to bring along with
him John Rogers.âln the interim, the
Committee received theexamination ofjames
Carey, taken at Tellico Blockhouse. On
the 25th September, Major Lewis arrived
at Qermantown, with Grant, Rogers and
Carey. These persons were examined, and
Major Grant gave bond for his appearance
before.the Semite.
To complete the series of correspondence
between Mr. Blount and Mr. Romayne, the
letter No. 9, seemed to be wanting. On
the 13th of July, it was received by the Se
cretary of State, under an anonymouscover,
in a foreign language.
Having heard of Capt'.Chifliolme having
failed fiom Philadelphia, in a veffcl belong
ing to Mr. Wm. Davy, they unt for Mr.
Davy, and examined him; his examination
led to the examination of George Lefher,
and others.
The committee mention that the Cheva
lier Yrujo, called upon them, and made a
communication which implicated a person of
the nape of Mitchell. They immediately
wrote to Major Lewis on the fitbjefl ; he
received their letter, but could not find the
person. A feqond communication was
made by the Chevalier on the fubjedt.
After Hating a number of other circum
flances, which we were not able to colledl,
the Committee conclude their report, by
regretting that they have not been able to
obtain more complete information on the
fubjedl, but assure the house that nothing
in their power has been wanting to obtain it.
The report being gone through, Mr.
Sitgreaves said, the reading of the docu
ments referred to would take up much time
Â«f the house, and as it was desirable that
they fhotild be printed for the life of the
members as soon as pofiible, he (hould wi(h
the reading might be dispensed With, and
that the yfual vote of printing might be a
greed to.
Mr. Gallatin hoped the papers might
be read, as the report consisted chiefly of a
reference to them.
The reading of the documents was then
eutercd upon as follows :
No. 1. A letter from William Blount to
Dr. Romayne.

Mr. Sitgreaves (who read this part of
the papers) mentioned that the above was
the letter inclosed to the-Secretary of State,
anoiiymoufiv, in a Foreign language, sign
ed " /In Eternal Enemy to \Foreign Influ
ence."
Mr. Thatcher enquired in what lan
guage the anonymous letter was written.
" Jv'jTp. Dawfon thought it neeeffary to state
left because this letter was written in the
Spanifli language it fliould give rife to
groundless suspicions, that the committee
had the strongest proof that it was written
by an American gentleman.

30. The deposition of Dr. Romayne be
fore the committee. The deponent states,
that hehadbeenacquainted with Mr. Blount
since 1782 ; that he became acquainted
with Chifholme whilst in treaty with Mr.
Blount inland (peculations ; sometime as- ,
ter the deponent intended going to London
toifell'land, but the falling in'priceofthatprop- j
erty prevented him ; -.at Governor Blount j

had passed between W. Blount and himfelf 1
011 the fubieft of Louisiana, which the for
mer regretted the Englilh did not poflVfs,
and spoke of going to England on the busi
ness, he regretted the Floridas did irot be
long to the United States. It was under
flood between them that it was most favora
ble for Louifia'ua tobelongto the Spaniards, j
but that the Englilh had much better have j
it than the French ; they agreed that it '
was neeeffary to found certain persons in
Philadelphia on the fubjeft, as well as in ,
Virginia and the southern states, spoke of;
his conversation to Blount about going to
England ; but that Mr. Blount neglefting â 
to answer his letters, he gave up the projeÂ£l.

NEW-YORK, Dec. 4.
COMMUNICATION.
The charge of the chief justice of Penn
sylvania (Mr. M'Kean) to the grand jury,
at a court cf oyer and terminer, held at Phi
ladelphia, on the 27th ultimo, has become
the fubjetl of much convetfation, more es
pecially however that part which refpc&s
the " crime of libelling."
We have paid particular attention our
selves to this part of his charge.
We di cover in it, it is true, many fenti
meuts which have much weight ; but we
have not fo.ind anv which are peculiarly
new, as far as relates to general principles.
We wish we could give his honor as !
much credit for.the application as for the fe- j
le&iori of the opinions he has offered on
the fubjedt. j
A Jiu died, and finally a dire A charge a- |
gainlt an individual editor of the city of i
Philadelphia, appears, moll clearly, to have !
governed the judges' mind, while elucidat
ing the cases of libel*, which were more im
mediately cognizable by the jury.
Warrr.th of temper, if our recollection
fe'rves us rightly, hss been, and ret f;ldom, i
attached to the operations of the judges' i
mind; and a little more caution and cool- 1 1
ness perhaps would have been ferviceslile to ; i
him on the occa-fion of which we are speak- â¢
It is far from our wish to vindicate the | '
Jicentioufnefs of the pref-', or to exculpate t
i any individual impiicat.'din the charge ; but â¢<
when we think we perceive a regard
â paid to the feelings of the foreign objeCt3 of c
the fupp/ifedheels, than to our own magif- 1
t rites', who have been frequently the fubjt&s I
of greater scandal, we cannot hesitate to \
pVoitoÂ«:;ce the present notice of thvra, far- j
tidl, incbnfjlen!, and derogatory to our nation- j a
si honor atidint};pen'd:n:c. c
Pauti A't, bcciufe a pointed and ftremi- t
ous support of the foreign rmiilllers of tiie I
French and Spanifn nations, li'Widently at- 'v
j tempted ; while foimer vfle nnd 1 tinjuft chSr- 1
ges.agtitift our lit; and pvefeiit chief magif- t
trate, an j the heads of departments, issuing
i from other presses, have not onlyefcaped the I
notice of the law, but been openly tounlcnanâ¢ J
c'cd. 0
' Inconsistent, because- Mr. M'Kean li
himfelf, in another part of his charge, enfor- f
ces the injury arising from the de trail ion of
; public characters, by remarkingâ \
" And where libels are printed against b
( persons employed ii> a public capacity, they c
i receive an aggravation, as they tend to fcan
dalizc the government, by reflefting onthofe n
| who are entrufled with the administration of
j jHiblic affairs and thereby not only endanger n
the public peace) as all others do, by stir- f
: ring up the parties immediately concerned p
to aÂ£ts of revenge, but have also a direst J
' tendency to breed in the people a dislike of c
their governors, and incline them to faction t
and sedition."
Yet the notorious and flagrant violation o
of every principle of moderation and juitice, h
: have been long permitted by editors, equal- I
: !y under his honor's cognizance. n
\Vj consider his present notice of libels as n
I derogatory.to oar national honour atid r
: dcnce, forafmuch as the view which the so- 1<
reign powers (and even those for whom the' a
i judge lias exprefTed so much delicate anxie- v
; ty) will have of that conduÂ£t which over
looks our domestic charadter and intcrefts,
while it is tremblingly alive to the feelings of
, those who cannot rightly expedt fucb atten- S
! tiou. I v
j Mr. M'Kean is pleased to diflinguifh be- ; I
1 tween those publications which " are forthe ' c
â  purpose of reformation, and those of defama- !
lion." This is a very just diftinÂ£tion ; but b
would have appeared in better colors, if it : e
had been made, and afted upon before. j f<
We equally agree with his fentlments a:
when he fays (fpeakiag of libellers) " were w
those to escape witk impunityâthe faireft tl
and bed characters, that this or any other r
country ever produced, would be villifyed w
andblafled, if not ruined." ir
There are so many of those " faireft and 1:
bell eharafters that ever this or any ether |
conntry produced," the vilifications of ai
which have afforded ample opportunity for u
the exercise of his honour's watchfulnefs ; t(
but this, it appears, has been specially re- j
served for those Foreigners who have not :
only " vilifyed " those ornaments of our t<
country, but have in every pofiible shape,
interfered with our most sacred rights as h
freemen, and injured our most cflential in- tr
terefts! j tl

Penfivc gloomy, and djJruflful, every effort n
of the daughter to cheer her fond parent only \\
served to rivet those opinions which he too has
t'lly fo>-med. The daughter apprehended ade

About a fortnight agn, the fatal evening ar- 01
rived when death drops the curtain on thefhoc- tl

The father repaired to a copse adjoining bi
his own garden, where he surprized the
youthful lovers in amorous dalliance. Rage
had flopped the power of utteranceâhe was is
about to present the fatal pistol at the fond ol
pair. ol
Just at the instant his purpose was shaken ei
by a piercing shriek. P
It was the .shriek of the daughter, who
had watched her father, whom she feared P
had long refolded upon I'uicide.
She seized kis armâthe partiesmade their ri
escape. .
The offending female, it appeared, was =
her own waiting woman, who dressed her
felf in her mjftrefTes' clothes to meet her
lover.
The truth ruflied on the father's mind,
he haddebafed his darling childbyfufpicion.
He was in the aÂ£t of committing murderâ
reflection ftept not betweenhim and deathâ
he clapt the pi'ftol to his own head and ex
pired in the daughter's arms.
The young lady has fallen a victim to
melancholy, ane the return of her senses is
hopeless.

tions; but notwiilulanding the moit fpiritcd
labour directed by. the niccd judgment, the
'voracious flames made more greedy by the
high wind which prevailed, eon fumed the
building occupied by Mrs. Broaders and
Western, and the hotifes improved by Mr.
Haggar,Mr. Evans, Mrs. Montcrief, Mr.
Jarret, and Mr. Farmer; when the course
of the conflagration was flopped. The
house of Mr. Hoffman, on the windward
fide of the fire, was much injured.
Mrs. Broaders had a well fumiflied hotife,
with accommodations for a large number of
boarders, and a handsome stock cf seamen's
clothing, which were mostly confuir.cd.
Mrs. Western, loft all her furniture, and
most of the articles in afmall huckfterVfhop.
Mr Haggar, the owner of the places te
nanted by himfelf, Mefi'rs. Farmer, F vans >
Montcrief and Jarret, have been the princi
pal fufTerers in' this melancholy occurrence.
The eflate might be valued at 30001. pur-
chafed with the earnings of induflry, and
the savings of economy.
Mr. Farmer preserved piofl of the stock
of a large grocery (tore, but owing to the
hurry of removal has to regret the loss of
ioil. worth of property. He desires his
1:10 ft grateful thanks may be tendered to the
numerous friends who assisted him. The
relt of the persons mentioned experienced
loss in the removal of their property, as did
also, the occupiers of houses and itores to
which the flame 9 did not extend.
FROM FRANCE.
On Sunday arrived at Plymouth, capt.
Spooner, in 46 days from Bourdeaux. Se
veral of our obliging friends favored us with
Paris papers to Oct. 3d received by this
captain.
The .profpedt of the renewal of hostilities
between France and Germany is undiminifh
ed- Every preparation on each fide is per -
fevered in. The last official news from the
army of Italy was to the 23d of Sept. at
which period the Emperor had not acceded to
the last propositions made, fay the Direfto
ry ; but the Paris papers fay, the Directors
were forming a new ultimatum, which they
intended to submit to the Emperor, as their
last overtures for a pacification.
The armies of the Rhine and Moftlle,
and Sambre and Meufe, were to be united
under Gen.Angereau, and form one army,
to be called the army of Germany.
The Cis-Rhinian Republic is organizing.
It is Itated, that the Bririftr havrtrfked
to feud a new Plenipotentiary to Lille.
Every branch of the French Government
had been occupied in doing honor to the
manes of Hoche. In the funeral procession
the bull of Franklin, our Countryman, was
carried.
Nothing new is mentioned of the Conspi
racy. The most rigorous measures wereper
fevered in to prevent the denounced party
from gaining an alcendancy again. It was
proposed in the Legislative Body that all
paflports interior to that date (Oct 1,)
Ihonld be annulled.
It foems that Carnot, Boifly d'Anglas,
Portalis, Pafloret, Dumolard, Duplanter,
Imbert Colombes, and some others, con
demned to transportation, had been so for
tunate as to escape, and had reached Swit
zerl rnd.
The American consul at Dunkirk, incul
pated, as is said, by some papers found at
Calais, has been arrested by order of the
Direftory.
The interior of France was considerably
agitated in parts remote from the govern
ment. Rebellion cxiftcd, and afTafiinatians
were frequent.
Extraft of a letter from Paris, Oft. 4.
" Two of our Commiflioners have arrived
at Paris, we hope they may be able to re-es
tablish the good understanding that once ex
isted between the two countries, and set
our political and commercial relations upon
the footing they ought to stand. Certainly
it of importance to both that amity (hould
be restored to them.
Captain Spooner fay 3, little information
is to be obtained at Bourdeaux, as freedom
of discourse is dangerous; and on account
of the frequent detlruftion of the post-rid
ers, papers are not regularly received from
Paris.
Talleyrand Perigord is fuperceded by one
Pagena?, as Secretary for foreign affairs.
