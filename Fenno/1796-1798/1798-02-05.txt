An ENQUIRY into the DUTIES of the
Female Sex. 1
By THOMAS GISBORNE, a. m. ,
The following among others are the principal
Snbje&s of this ufeful Work.
temalc Education. Of tÂ»e mode-tf intrtduc
ing Toting tVamtn into general Society. Female
Cor.verfatisn and Epijlolary Corre/pondence.â R
Dre/i. Amufementi. Excess in the pitrfuit of
Amusements. Employment of Time. Confeder
ation) antecedent te marriage. Duties of tn'at
rimanial Life, <zuith a view to different Situations
and Circumflances. Parental Duties. Duties
qf the middle period Life. Duties of the De
(line of Life. ' , J
Â£S* From the title oi the foregoing work it f
may perhaps be imagined, tlut the Enquiry is '
altogether arid exclufi*e!y direilfd to the duties S;
of the Female Sex : it tbjjfrfore, may not bÂ» un- P
nectflary, or unufeful, so remark, that many of
the chapters contain matter relative to the cÂ»n
<Juft of both I'exes, and particularly those which
relate to the duties of Matrimonial LifeâParental
Duties : âDuties of thf Middle Periodâand of â *"
the Decline of Life. âAnd the reader of either
fe* that peruses this work with a view of gain- A
itig information leading to fubilantial pleafore,
will assuredly not be disappointed. .In fad, it
is a wark interesting to the happiness of Socie
ty, and mult be ufipful wherever read j tending 0
not only to point out in easy and engaging lan
guage, the piths that lead the youthful mind to
Ifappinefs and comfort, but those alio, in the a
walk of which, theparent and the middle period
ofHfefcall find sincere delight, and declining
years render themselves comfortable and happy
with all around them.

Upon the operation Â»f the French Cmi/lUiitiM, as
exemplified in tbetranfsflions fft.br 1 ith Fruc
tidor it h year, (nth September 1191) and the
days fallowing-
The circumftarieei which have recenly taken
' place in France, ire of 1 nature f> important at
to deserve the ferloii! jnd attentive considera
tion of every friend to liberty and humanity â
It it proper therefore ia the fir/% place to state
impartially the melt material faCU, at they are
represented hy the fucccefsful par.y, and then to
draw such iiÂ»/Vencei ai follow naturilly frpm
them.
A military force idling u rider the commandiof
abire majority J*f therxecntivedireClory.difiblv
ed by violence the meeting of both branches of
1 the legifoturc.
The fame majority ps the directory, together
with a certain part of the legijLtive aflcmblieÂ«
then proceeded to ail at the whole direflory
and the whole legislature.
They a (Turned likewise the exercise of the most
important judieiiry fundion!. They uuder
tuok to command that sixty-sour individuals
Ihotiid he haniihed from th* country'and their
property flj|Heftered Most of these individu
als were mensberi of' the L-gifUtive councils;
two of them wire members Â«f the'dtreilory.
, I hey subjeCted to the like condemnation the
editort and printers at more than forty news
papers, and pljced the public journaliUs under
the controul of the police for the term of a year.
They banifted from the country great num
bers of perfoni, who had returned to it under
the prote&ion of the laws, and cenfifcattd their
property.
'I hey aanulled all the lift eleAiont through
out nearly two thirdi of the â¢ whole re
public, and interdicted all the pefons then
chosen in those department!,from the execution
of their fon<?tions. They expelled thereby one
hundred and twelve memhert in a mast from the
council of joo, and forty from the council of
elderi, befideathe perfoni expelled hy ihedn
crie of tranfportatian.
The interdi&ion extended likewise to all the
member! of the administration of forty nine
department! and of all the mmcipalitiei within
them, and to all the jurors, fudges and juflicei
of the peace chosen at that election-
And all those tranfa&ions are founded upon
a general afie:tion of a profound and extensive
co*H>tfÂ«Cy 1% eflTefi a counter, revolution and re
ltore royalty.
There iÂ« not however any one person allowed
the benefit ofa trial ; excepting against two or
three of the individual! thus fufferihg, there ii
not even the (embl&aee of a fperifie accusation
producedâagaint no one of thein is there
brought evidence that could be admissible in any
court of jultice in Europe.
I The prevailing power at the fame time e#n
fider it as an unequivocal proof of their own
lenity, raildnefs and humanty, that they have
ihed no blood upon thii occasion, and that they
have not taktlc the fives of thoTt from whom
the hive taken every thing else.
_ These meafurei were all in manifeft and uu
difputed violation of the conftitucion of France,
and independent of Â«U aivil cotiilitutiom they
were in violation of the nataral right! of the
persons against whom they wfre pointed : nay
farther they were in violation of the firft* and
most fiiuoWlomâo Mhumanity and of ioftie*.
libertyÂ® orÂ»SpCTt*.
or reputation, and of opinion, right's moll of
which in the eftiraatioa of liberal and Spirited
men, are mor* precious even than thai of life
have all berk violated in the persons ofmimerou!
French oitizefli in a mast. |
The persons too against whom these proceed,
ings have been carried to the greatest extreme!
of severity,, were among the citizen! who had
rendered the most important and eflentii I servic
es to the republic. Citizens whose brows were
enriched with the laurels of victory, or still j
more adorned by the peaceful olive. Among I
them are names which Europe had learnt to
pronounce with affeCtion and esteem. Piehe
gru, whohadffhewn himfelf modest amidst the
most brilliant martial triumphs, who had uni
formly exhibited the rare example of success
without insolence, and of victory without op
pression. Bartbelemi; who had fecored' to hii
country the attachment of the neighbouring
republics, and had begun so honorably the * o. k
of reftormgtq ber the bleifings of peace s and
many other* who had diltinguilhed them
selves hy the zeal and with which they
had uniformly supported the revolution and the
republic.
The party who have thui suspended thecon
flitution, and the principle! of justice and of
humanity, to the ruin effo many persons pecu
liarly entitled tA*htbenefit.of them, alledge for
their juftificatjon, that it wai neeejfary, to de
feat aroyalift confpiiacy which had pervaded
every part of the republic, gained an ascendancy
in the greater part of the demons and a majo
rity in hoth the legislative eouncili, and intro
duced iti agents and partiians in all the judicial
tribunal!.
" In affairs ,of state" said the firft message of
the directory (o the legislature upon this occa
sion, " roeafiip* of extremity ari estimated on
ly by circumftpute!.'*/
In the fecotj4/seffage, which urgei the legif
lature to " puitgje the foil of France, of the very
small number of known and deftgnated chiifi
of the royal confoirators," they fay in yet plain
er term! " y<}u wtllbt t6td fTfrmfipd,, /Â», ms
willbehtint;duj),txcuj&t will _be invented,'^-de
lays will be dejired, time will be gained, and the
conftitvtion witl%e assassinated under the ap
pearance of invoking it. Thii campaflion which
ii implored for tertain men where will it lead
you fâto behold the fame men take back from
your own thread of their guilty plots,
and gather in your own bofomi the hcrrible-fire
brand! of eivil war for the deftruftion of the
country. What mijfnketpity, what/a/a/senti
ment, what narrow vie<wi are those that would
concentre the .mention Â«f the legislative body
upon individmds and balance between the fate
of afeiy mrnrmd the fate of the republicâwe
are obliged to tell you that you are placed in un
paralleled circvtnftances, and that unless you
would abandon yourfeltet to your enemiei.you
cannot apply ordinary rules to an extraordinary
cafe." J
And in an addrefsfrom the direiftory to the
French nation, fhey fay " it cannot be doubted
but that in ntoft of the department!, the elec
tions were the work of the confuiring royslift
party"-' '
Whether these allegalioat are really founded
upon truth, of whether they are the mere fug
geftiona yf a ijMoriout fadlion to loadtheir de
feated antagotffts witb pubi c odium, the result
equally provet some great defeit in the French
conftitutinn, F<* upon t hc firft supposition, it
is evident, that the confiitution cannot be suit
able to the cllarafler and inclinations of a peo

overthrow of the republic and retloration of the
throne ?
It is not polli ( bli to imagine that the periple
from whom all thcie choicfe proceeded were de
ceived or miUaken with regair! (o llie objefls,
of their preference. They could not have fe
leifted, as able and zealous friends of thercpub
lic.fucha number of perl'uns who were in truth
the agents of royaltyâNoâNor is it at all pie
tended. T'le Irgifl jture in an address to the na
tion finer the revolutionary movement, teil
them that frsm the last " primary and electo
ral aflemblies proceeded a crow.l of delegate!
unknown before the revolution, or known only
by the most revolting incivifm / that in almost
all the offices they formed a majority of men
either /educed, fold or tnijled, and that almost
every where the voice of guilt and of royal in
trigue had prevailed "
It is then with open eyes, and perfeflly well
knowing what they were doing, that the majo
rity of the legal voters in the priiosry aflVm
blie.i through the greatest part of France' gave
their votestoftien whose difpofitidns wen; known
to lie hostile to ihe existing conftttution, to men
who si 'hed for the restoration of royalty ; and
the declaration of thc aflembly goet still further,
it fays that " the intrigues of the royalists were
so atiiverfally operating, and fÂ«great were their
means of corruption and deftru&jve influence,
that it is surprising they did not every where
fneceed, but that in some few placet theele&ion
escaped them."
What thc means,of cÂ®rruption and e'eftrudtive
influence were, is not expressly said, but it is not
easy to conceive that at any future period thc roy
alists willp'Jftfi less means of influence than they
did at any period of tha late cle&fons. It it well
known for she iaÂ£ seven years the ruling powers
in France Ivve been in th:: continual uÂ£e of the most
energetic means of an ahfolute and uocontrauled
authority to deHroy every vestige of a royal party.
Exile, confiscation and death, have all been em
ployed With the n-.oft unbounded liberality, to cx
tirfate, root and branch, every attachment toroy
alifm. Coercion ha! done its utmost The foil of
France has been purged, as they term it, of some
hundred v thoufandtot her children, by emigration,
by despotism, hy war,- by fhootlrg, drowning,an!
guillotining ; nearly one third U' the whole pro
perty of France hat been wrefled its owners 1
and converted into national domains, and oath af
ter oath has been jmpefed upop the remaining iÂ»-
hahitants, to destroy every sentiment andevery in
tcreft that could htve any adherence toVoyalty.
\tt this is the time at which we are told, that
these proleribed, ruined relics of royalty, wander
ing about thc earth in vain to ftni a lhclter, and
fcarccly having where to lay their heads, possess in
fluence to command and dire A the choice of the
people almost all over France.
It is impossible to account for this enormous fl
yer-ruling influence, but upon tha supposition .ei
ther that the petplf of France find upon experience
the government under whjch they now live less
calculated to promote their happiness thin they
think it would be if it were tempered with a por
tion of kingly powfr ; or that the majority of the
fuffrages were given without regard to the puMic
interest : were bargained away by rank and un
qualified corruption. . ,
4i tfle jccmrima
na}orii tHe French people to detest the repuh
lit, we may be confident that it cannot last long
under its present form. It may he converted into
a Military republic, bearing a semblance of dem -
cracy, hut no will be left to the jexer
eife of the people. They will 'â¢ have nothing to
do with the laws hut obey them." For it is net
by sieafures like those which have 'lately been
pra&ifcd, that alienated affc&ionscan be regained;
it is not by the violation of every principle of rep
resentation, that infidels to thc system of represen
tative government can be reclaimed. When the
people fee the objects of their choice, forbidden
the exercise ef their functions, baniibed their coun
try, and treated like thc vilest malefactors, with
out Sentence, without trial, nay without accusation,
by the mere law of force, and military violence,
the people may be silent. they may even listen to
1 addreflV-s which ring all the changes of liberty, of
patriotism, of virtue, and of equality in their ears ;
they may beartÂ«betoldthattheirconllitutioriha>beei;
suspended for a mapient, the better to preserve h ;
all the holy fervors of democracy may kindle to
illuminate their mindt with the glories oF the rep
resentative systemâin vainâthey will remain
" dark, dark, dark amid the blaze of noon I '.
thry will never bend their Understandings to the
logic of fach a government, nor their inclinations
to tho diAaus of such teachers ; at the very next
eleition they will repeat theproofs of their royalist
prediUClions, they will again choose for their lc
giflators and judges, characters unknown tb the re
vciiition.- or known only for their incivifm ; again
the neceifity will recur of favingtheconhitution by
prolcriptions and confifcations; again will the lub
lime conllitution find itt only Support in the mer
cenary arm of the soldi er.
The conllitution hat consecrated the principle of
universal fuffnge in the primary aflemblies, and
upon the very firft occasion in which toit fafcinat
ing theory hat been reduced to practice, such are
the confequcn.-et, that almost every where the voice
of guilt, and-of royal intrigue has prevailed.
This principle.of universal fuffrage in the i rima
ry alTrmblies, was indsed the great and fundamen
tal point upon which the French revolution Wasf.iid
to be founded: for this a'l its severities have been
juftified and all it! exseffes palliated : iu this, ac
cording to the leading revolutionary theonfts con
lifted the eftlntial lovereignty i f the ponple : it was
this that cloathed with tranlct odeni brightness the
genius of democracy, this that raised his towering
head so high above the pigmy elvei of aristocracy
and Bionarchy. We remember well with what an
awful solemnity the very name of tht people was re
sounded, in the early stages of the revolution âAll
wiSdom, all power, all goodness, were in the lan
guage of tkeir encomiaftt, their appropriate quali
ties ; and^Scarcely ccÂ»ld the attribute! of heaven

It i 6 the undoubted and uniform tenden

during the heat of the contest, a violent de- j

ven of democracy hi the blood. The jjlhayv
and whiiky insurgents fuÂ«cellively aflumed
democratic principles, as equally true and
popular, and endeavoured, thank heaven in
vain, to cxite an enthufiaflic zeal to sustain
them. The decline of (jfhis fiery spirit will
be lamented by those, who cannot conceive
that the love of liberty exillt, if it be not
exalted to fury. With them it is not a
light, a diftate of reason, but a passion,
qaally sanguinary and stupid ; sanguinary,
because it neither discerns, nor approves a
ny, but violent means, and, stupid, because
if left to itfelfjtt is fu[e to destroy its obj*a.
Accordingly we hear the democrats affeSt.
ing to lament the supposed extinction oftht
spirit of 1776, at if there were no reason
for repose, when the struggle is over. When
refiftar.ee ceases, the passions must
nor is it in nature for them to keep up. It
would be well for us if that revolutionary
fervour had afltrallv parted off. However
necessary it may be for the security of liber
ty* when it it endangered, it didurbs the
tranquil possession when it is not. Every
popular ferment bewilders the judgment of
those, whom it affefts, and is the fruitful
fouree of the moll obstinate errors. A nun
in a passion is not the befl reafoner : and
why Aiould the democrats imagine that the
nation cannot reason, unless it raigi, or
that we are all iu a lethargy, because we are
not in a frenzy; yet who care? lefsfori776

well might a raging fever be called health,
or fanaticifm be confounded with the temper
of true devotion.
Nothing is so opposite to aoy principle ai
the extreme of that principle. Nothing ia
more contrary to republicanism, than de
mocracy. Indeed the latter is republican
ism out of its right miad. How many per
sons have nevertheleft extolled the French
revolution, precisely because it went.to ex
tremes. The Chronicle writers havt i a va
riably grounded their admiration of French
principles! on their being carried fu far, that
they could not answer, and have nevn an
swered the purpose. The word citiiun,
which Robespierre used, as much as any bo
dy, seemed to them a greater treasure, thaa
those principles, which have Rood the test
of experience, viz. the separation of the
Executive and Legislative powers; the di
vision of the Legifiature, and the indepen
dence of the judicial. It is certainly true
that the democrats are image worihippers ;
Papists in politics ; a liberty cap, a dry pole
called a liberty tree, and a harlequiD liag
command that homage, which thej__r.sÂ£uj[Â«

It is taken for granted that men of fen ft
will not aik for proof that a violent demo
cratic spirit would fiirely deftrey a real Re
publican system. If the people are gener
ally democrats, ft is a mockery to think or
maintaining long a genuinely Republican
constitution, for they would soon change
the letter and administration of it, into *
simple democracy. It is not supposed that
men of sense and reading will fiecd to be
told that such a change would be abomina
ble. Uncontrolled power, wherever it may
re-fide, is despotism. The passions of'tbe
majority; if uncheeked, would destroy the
rights and the lives of the minority. But
in democracies the majority only ftct* to go'
vern, for a faftion never fails to cngrofi
