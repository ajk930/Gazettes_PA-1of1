Mr. Patton, midshipman, in the barge and cutters,
with their erews and fix mari icg, giving dire&iVns

ATTEi\TION, HAYMAKERS !
Suspend your scythesâLean upon your pitchforks
âStick your take* in the sod, and while thr

Neighb ur Wintnw's advice upon drinking.

WHEN we iweat mod, we third rao ft, and

that hquurbelt, which make* you raoft Itrong and
healthy. , 0
Then do not drinksâThe body in Hit* ful ry
season being extremely heated, acts like a still, the
rum immediately fl.es off, and the heavy, dammy
dregs of the beer and sugar, temain to clog the
ttomack, render the laborer dull and weak, and of
ten excite inflammatory disease.
Do not drink -.oddy or milk punch, for the fame
reaion.
If rum, brandy, whiflcy, gin or other ardent
fpints must be drank, take half a gill at a time,
ui.mixed, and immediately drink large draughts of
water after it. For the fame reason, when a man
is crack brained enough to throw a fire brand into
a magazine of powder, .he cannot do better, than
to throw water upon the burning coals a* fact fc,
potiiblf.
Drink Switehel, that is, molaffw or maple fu.

Diink whey, or milk and water, two-third* wa
terâspruce or small bear.
Diink cider. Not boiledâif you would be
merry, but cider and water, if you would be

Sey the hay-season lasts, taking the after growth
into the calculation, one month, lay that you have
three hands to workâallow tbem each half a pint
of rtim each day. This will amount, by a tough
calculation, to lix gallons, which at twelve fhiHings
a gallon fur Wtll-lndti mm, would cost twelve dol
, lars, beftdcs (he expence of sugar. New-England
rum, it is true, would be something left, but bran
dy something more. Now the fuai of twelve dol
lars in thcfe hard times, w mid do many valuable
things for a farmerâit might purahafe three calves,
which would treble in two years. It would pay
the minifteiial, the town, the countj or state taxes
of a small farmer. It would buy many a comfort
able mattei for his wife whn (he blefles him with
the ri> h present of a sturdy boy, or healthy gid.
It might effect a valuable fwopin oxen, or perhaps
pay two or three small notes or accounts, or such
patt of them as may prevent the lawyer from mak
ing two or three bills of cot, each larger than the
original debt, and to save the favourite mare, or
the lik ly two year old colt, from being taken by
the fheriff, and fold for h.ilf their value at thepoft.
But some of you, fellow-labourers, drink strong
liquors when you work out as we do now, because
yoa fay they cost you nothing ; and you are ready
to call your employers stingy who wilh to discoun
tenance the use of spirits. You are millaken, my
friends, every gill of rum given to you by those,
who hire yoa, colls yoÂ» much.
Sometimes it colls you a quarrel with your best
friends, fumetimes a bloody nose, or btoken limb,
and often n lawsuit, and ,bill of cost, or a fine up
on confi ffi.ui, before a juttice of the peace, tor as
sault an.l battety ; and often a long doctor's bill
for a disorder, which yru may riot, but the physi

EXTRACTS
From a Journey into the Wellern Territory,in '94.
" From Albany, I proceeded to Schenectady, fif
teen miles by llage. Schenetlady is a handsomely
situated little town on the banks of the Mohawitj
river. At this place 1 took an open boat, naviga*
ted by three men, in which I pafied to Lake On
tario, without any other interruption than two (hort
portages, one at the little falls of half a mile, round
which they are now cutting a canal; the other of
one mile, at Fort Stanwix, about one hundred
miles well of Schetuflady ;at which place we leave
the Mohawk river, and defceud the torrent to 01-
Â«ne hundred miles mor'e to the weft, where
the British hold a poll at the entrance of Lake On
tario, commanded by a captain. The high price
which hatters' furs at prclent command in the Uni
ted States, is the only inducement 1 conceive for
fmuggliag pa ft the poll, for cxcept a few articles
imported from the Ealt Indies, 1 found the retail
(hops at Kingftonand Niagara, felling as low, and .
many articles, pafticularly woolens, lower than in
the city of Philadelphia*
From Ofwego, rclTels fail to Niagara, King-.
Hon, and other ports on the lake ; but fettlera
more frequently continue along the fouthfhoreof
the lake to Niagara, about one hundred and twen
ty miles in open boats ; finding a reffel here ready
to fail for Kingston, I embarked ia bef lor that
place, about ti houraiail.f " Front -Kfngfton I proceed to Niagara, in a
'schooner of upwards of one hundred tons burthen
a.-rofs this little sea of frefh water ; a sea it may
jutliy be called, for we arc a great pan of the time
for three days out of fight of the land; though pas
sages have been made in twenty hours ; we enter
the Niagara river between the fort and the town
callcd Newark, with a beautiful profpeft of both.
Â« The fort (tands in a commanding fituatisn on
a point formed by the jun&ion of the rivar and
lake, upon the east (i Je of the river, and is a regu
Jar fortification, in good repair, and well gartifon
cd.
" The mouth of this river affords a f?fe and
copious harbour, fufficieatly large for half the Bri
tish navy.
" The town of Newark is situated in lat. 43
north, on the weft banks of the river, extending a
long the lake about a mile, enjoying in the summer
the frefh breezes from this little sea, in altnoft eve
ty direiSion, plentifully supplied with fifh at all fca
fonÂ» of the year. In the winter here are caught
by fcins, quantities of white fifh, which seem to be
peculiar to that river, they are generally from two
to fix pounds weight, and are considered the bed
fifh in the lakes; betides these sturgeon, brass, and
many other excellent fifh, are in great plenty ; sal
mon are taken in all the creckcs round the lake ;
these varieties of fifh arc not only eftecmed a luxu
ry, but a great afliftance to new beginners in sup
porting their families, many laying in a half dozen
barrels or more for their winter's use.
" The lower landing or Queenltoa, is about fe
ten miles up the river from Newark, where the
Teffels difchargc their cargoes, and take in furs col
lected from three to one thousand five hundred
â tiles back, there I have seen four vefiels of sixty
and one hundred tons burthen, unloading at the
fame time, and sometimes not left than sixty wag
gons loaded iu a day, which loads they carry ten
miles to the upper landing place or Chipawa creeks,
three miles pad the great falls. From Chipawa
the merchandize is tranfportcd in batteaux to Fort
Erie, a diftancc of eighteen miles and are shipped
there on board of vessels for Detroit and Michili
mackinac. Detroit, I was told was a pleasant coun
try, through a low and marlhy foil, more noted for
its fur trade, than its agriculture.
M Niagara is at present the temporary feat of
government, confiding of a governor, a legislative
conncil, and houfeof aifembly chosen by the peo
ple ; here annually in the month of May, they
meet for the purpose of legislation. Members of
the afTem Jy are chosen sot four years, and havcal
lead fat three sessions.
'Â« The ftreights of 'Niagara, from its peculiar
ituation, being the channel through which all the
produce of the vafl country above mult pats, is look
ed forward tsMS a place of the firft confluence,
and where a farmer will at all times find a market
for his produce, the transport being easy from
thence to the Atlantic. Here have 1 seen with a
mazrment that famed catataft, which exceeds eve
ry defcriptioii I have ever heard of it, but it would
be idle in me to pretend to give you an idea of it
âIt ftriltes the eye with more grandeur and fub
limi y than the jfn can convey. Among many
other natural curiosities, a spring about two miles
above these falls, attracts the attention of the curi
ous } emitting a gas, or inflammable air, which,
when confined in a pipe, and a flame applied to it,
will boil the water of a tea kettle in fifteen minutes :
Whether this may hereafter be applied by machine
ry, to ufefol purposes, time will determine. It was
lately discovered by clearing away and burning the
brush under the bank of the river, to credt a mill,
and was observed after the brush was consumed to
burn for days together, to the great aflonifhment
of the inhabitants.
" About three hundred miles weft of this fort
Detroit fittiate on the east fide of the ftreights, be
tween lake Erie and Huron, around which,a French
fettlemenr was eftabhfhed before the reduction of
the province, but attending more to the Indian
trade than agriculture, made but little progress as
farmers. The English fettlemcnts lately begun on
the shore are already in a high ftatc of cul
tivation, however the French have fine orchards,
from which Niagara is at present supplied with cy
der and apples.
" To the northward of Detroit about three
hundred andfifty miles, lies fort . Michilimackinae,
on aa island between lake Huron and Michigan, is
aboute five miles round, arid an entire bed of grav
el incapable of cultivation, but mod remarkable for
being the general depot and grand rendezvous of
all the Indian trader*, who meet in the month of
June from every quarter, delivering their furs and
receive their outfus for the ensuing year. Spanish
set lemeius many mihsdown the Miflifippi are sup
plied with British goods through this channel, to
mu h greater advantage than from New-Orleans
where the rapids of the oppose almost
Unfurmountablc difficulties t;i ascending it.
" This .fort, the forts of Detroit, Niagara, and
Ofwego, fell within the United States, when the
line* of separation were drawn, at the treaty of
peace, in the year one thousand seven hundred and
eighty three; fort Miami, which was built by the
British lately, is also within those. lines.

Extract of a letter from Madame de la Fayette, to

" I am particularly grateful, for the regret you
express at the impossibility of granting my requests.
I made them 'in the firft instance to the cotnmaiicL
ing officer of Olmuta, because hit Imperial Majesty
had told me to address myfelf to himâl made them
in writing because 1 had no means of feeing him.
" I asked 111. Permission to go to mass, bccaufe
1 ought to do every thing in my power to go to it.
On Sundays and hollidays.
" 2d. To be attended accafionally by a servant,
because having learnt when at Vienna, that M.
Bournorville, Camus, Bancal, and others, Con
ventional prisoners, who had fervanta, enjoyed here
the libetty of feeing them all the day long, I flat
tered myfelf-that the fame favor might be granted
to me for fomc momenta.
" 1 have also asked that M. de Maubourg and
De Puay might pafa some houra with tia, because
in the difjrrent prisons of France, in Robefpierre'a
time (where, aa yeu know, I have 'pasTed sixteen
months) I waa in the habits of feeing the prifonera

" 1 beg pardon, for having in thia vefpefl allow

" I confeft with great pleasure, that we agreed
to paticipate all the rigours of M. de la Fayette's

repeat with all our hearts, that we ire happier with
M. de la Fayette, even in thia prison, than wc should
be any where else without him.
" To juftify, however, the liberty I have taken
with you, I will remind you, fir, that his Imperial
Majesty in the audience he war pleafcd to grant me,
had the goodness to fay to me that " 1 should find
M. de la Fayette very well treated, and that if I
had any request to make, I ihould be well fatiafi

ExtraS from a teller.
\t may be interesting to you â¢to know how
thing! go with the French and Engliih. St. Lu
cia is totally >in pofleffion of the former; they
ftorm{;d tiie forts, and succeeded in carrying them.
Some!negroes, and naturalized French were hang
ed, ajid some brought to this place for the fame
purpdf-. -The commander in chief, Sir Ralph A- j
bercrombie, arrived from thence to this place, seven j
days ago, with part of the forces to retake the |
windward fide of this island from the French and
Charibs, who have had pofleffion, a long time palt.
On the 10th at sunrise, the British commenced
tbeir ajtack with 4,300 men ; at two in the after
noon they stormed and took the old fort, and three
redoubts between It, and the new fort", About
three the firing eeafed ; and a flag of truce from
the French came in.âFinally it was fettled to sur
render all the pofleffions.on the island to the Bri
tish, and the French prisoners to receive the ho
nors of war. Those who were natural fubjefts of
Great Britain, and had.joined the French,' were
to be at the discretion of the commander in chief
âas also those negroes who fled to them. The
Charibs, however, in the night, as well as, the
plantation negroes, got into the woods, and a bo
dy of rangers and riflemen are-after them. On the-,
lith, at 3 o'clock, P. M. the prisoners came in,
and were conveyed on board the different (hips in
the harbour. Such a (habby set I never beheld be
fore. Thejr amounted in all to above 400, out of
whom only five or fix were white men ; the others
were negroes and mulattoes. They were com
manded by a negro, who had a French commission
of Captain, as had also many of the other negroes
and mulattoes. They came into town with their
fide arms, and (omitting the balk of the prison
ers, who were (the dirtiest and most ragged crew
under heaven) appeared decently dreft in their uni
form."

'' March, 1793. j
" \Vc have no small degree of pleasure in announcing
. the present work to our readers ; as one wh ch from the '
freedom of itsenquiry, tke grindeur of its views, and the
fortitude of its principle, is eminently deserving of atten
-3 tion. By this eulogium, we would by no means be under
- flood tofubferibe to all the principles which these volumes.
f contain. Knowledge is not yet arrived at that degree of
Â» certainty which ts requisite, for any two mcil to think a
s like 00 all fuhjeits; neither has language attained that enn
- fiftent accuracy, which can enable them to convey their
- thoughts, even when they do think alitee, an a manner pet- u
3 IfeSly correct and intelligible to both. These difficulties
are only to be overcome by a patient, inceffar.t, and bene
, Volent in^eftigatisn.
: | " Many of the opinions which this wor!ccontains, are
f'] bold ; some of them are r.ovrl; anafomedocbtlefsare er-
I roneous-âbut that which ought to endear it even to thofc
t , whose jn-inciples it may offnid, is the of argu
: J pent adduced in it to prove, tViat peace and order nioft ef
: fcstuallv promote the happiness after which poiitiral re- â 
j firmer* are panting-;âthat as the progress-os knowledge
1 js gradual, political reform ought nÂ®t to be precipitate
j and that convulsive violence is dangerous not only to tpdi
j viduals (for that r fult comparatively would, be of fmail
Recount) but to the general cause of truth It is the op
pofiteof this principle that infpirct the ensmiesof politicâ
Â» enquiry r/ithfd much t<--ror ; it is the fuppofttion that
thange inuft inevitably be attended by the turbui-nce and
injustice of commotion; a.n.l that innovation cannot be
tnade without the interven ion of evil.s more deftrmftive
than tl.ofe wluch are intended to be reformed. Under the
(lorvitftion of this philanthropic fenfiment, of calm and
(gradual reiofm. (which in its proper place he has fully i!.
u Urate J) Mr. Goowiw proceeds without scruple firft to en
quire into present evil, through itscff.ntial branches, and
hejit to demonltrate future good. . 1
" "Dividing his work into eight books, and makihg the
IMPORTANCE or rOLITICAL institutions the fubjeA of
the firft, he begins by an attempt to prove the omnipo- -Â»
tence of government over the moral habits of mankind;
Mid that on thcte moral habits their wisdom, virtue and > ,
felicity depend."
