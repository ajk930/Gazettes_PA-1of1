promptitude, fonie detachments of the Prince's

so considerable as was stated in the Paris papers.
We have feerr letters from Italy, addreffedto*

attribute all the disasters that hare befallen that

1 HAVE thehonor to lay before you a narra- nv
tive of the proceedings of the squadron under my m
command since my departure trom Co*k on the lo!
19th ult. On the following day, in confequenre co
of my having received intelligence of the enemy's th
privateers being on the coast, to the northward of
Cape Clear, I dispatched his majesty's sloop Hazard, bt
with orders to Lieut. Paiker, her commander, to cc
cruize between the Cape and the mouth of the li<
Shannon, while I, for the mora effedtual protec- at
tion of our trade, cruized with the Santa/ Marga- r<
retta in the vicinity of Cape Clear. I had the fa- tl
y'jfadtion a few days afterwards to learn that rhe ft
Hazard had retaken two prizes, and had ichaced a
the privateer off the coast that captured them, after si
a narrow escape from being taken. On the 11 th p
' inft. having met with other (hips of the lrifh lta o
tion, I Concluded upon mak'ing a circuit on the ai
otifer limitÃ of my station, accompanied by the al
Santa Margaretta, and at dawn of day on the Bth y
inft. Scilly bearing E. half S. 17 leagues, we dif- n
colored three (hips of war 011 our lee-beam, distant a
two or three miles, to which we immediately gave C
chace, and soon afterwards perceived them to edge
away, and that they were eneniy's (hips, two sri- C
gates and a large (hip corvette. At 9, A M. they
formed themselves into a close bow and quarter lire,
and continued to run from us in that position, the
large (I (hip under easy fail, for the support of his
squadron. In this situation we approached them 1
very fact, and muftiiave fpeedil/ brought them to b
aflion.âl therefore made the signal to form f r si
battle, the Marga'etta being at this time ahead of a
the Unicorn, and at the fame time direfied< her by d
signal to come to learn from Captain F
Martin his opinion of the enemy's fo-ee, who in ft
formed me, that the largest ship 38 gun sri- F
gate, the Thames, and a corvette. ' I ordered Cap- 4
tain Martin to attack the Thames, acquainting him b
with my intention to fight'the large ship with the it
Unicorn. On our nearer approach, the corvette, I
which detained the o'her (hips, gradually hauled si
out to windward, and passed our weather-beam in u
long gun-(hot, fleering afterwards the fame course e
as the other (hips, and with the intention, I then n
imagined, to be in to give support to ei- a
tner of her friends, eventually molt needing it.
At !, P. M. the two frigates hoilled French co- 7
lours, th: Jargeft ship a commodore's pendant, and d
at the fame moment eommenced a quick and well
â¦
â¢
directed n firÂ» on us with their flern chacti. The
corvette at this time hauled more up, and to my
great astonishment, brought to, to board a sloop
passing ui on the contrary tack. As the cotnmo- j
dore continued to wait for the Thames, we thereby -V ont
approached them both, bat were cc-nfiderably ry
carded by the effefls of their (hot. At 4, P. the
Themes being the fternmoft, bore round up, to a- .J ns
void the fire from the Unicorn, and to pour a r rum
broadlide into the Marga?etta's bow, when 1 had 'j
the pleasure to fee Captain Martin mar.oeuvre his
(hip with the greatest jndgment, and with the ut- Jl
most gallantry he laid himfelf close along fide his morf
opponent. The ftiperior and well direfled fire from
the Santa Margaretta, marked the discipline of his
ship, and soon put the Thames into his poffeflion.
The commodore, on feting his companion fall,
mÂ«dc all fail, and by a fuddefi and judicious, tho'
unfuccefsful rnancsuvre, endeavored to gain the
wind of the Unicorn. We.were at this"time cha* .
ing him toward the entrance of the Irifn channel, (
and soon after passed clpf; to the Talker Kork.
The parity of failing in the two ships, aided by
the judgment of the enemy's commander, kept us (
at running fight for ten hours, during which period
â  we were much annoyed in our fails and rigging,
. j and were for fpme time unluckily deprived of the
, ! use of our main topsail ; but on its falling less
: wind, afier dark, we were enabled to use our fu-
, I pernumerary flying fails, royal fteeiing fails, &Â«. ;
r whish, by (low degrees, brought us so near his wea
tlier quarter, as to take the wind from his fails;
1" when, at half past ten at night, after having pur-
. sued 210 miles, (he shot up along fide of our an
s tagomft, gave him three cheers, and commenced . ( t(
J clife ivftion, which'* jntinued in that position with
3 great impe'tuoficy on both fides for 35 minutes ;
J when, 011 clearing up of the smoke, I obfeived that
, the enemy had dropt on oor quarter, was close
h hauled, attempting by a malterly manoeuvre to cross
â  ( our (tern and gain the wind. This was happily
1! prevented, by our instantly throwing all a back,
. and, giving the (hip strong (tern way, by which we
palled his bow, regaining our tituation, ~md renew
ed the a'tack. The effeas of our fire soon put
,e an end to all manoeuvre, for the enemy's ship was
, e completely dismantled, her fire ceased, and all fur-
2 ther resistance appearing to be ineffe&ual, they cal-
,e led to us they had surrendered. The /hip proves 1
to be La Tribune, commanded by commodorc John
e . MotiHon, mounting 44 guns, thpug'n pierccd for
, e 48; on the main deck 26 twelves, on the quarter-
id deck and forecaftle 15 long fixes, and 321b. carro-
s nades ; had on board at the commencement ot the
/, adtion 337 men, 47 of whom are killed, 13 badly,

a _ The ship is quite new, launched since the com-
id mencement of the war, fails extremely fail, is of
ly large dimensions, being on the gun deck two feet

p's in the situation 1 held this day. Indeed nothing
less than the confidence of the most gallant support 1
from them, and the high opinion I entertain of the
Santa'Margaretta, our feebnd, could induce me to
rilk an adtion witlj a force apparently so much our

Wc present the following detail of news from the
J borders of tbe Rhine. The army commaaded by j
Kit bet is beyond the Lahn, where he has received
' a retoforcemest of three divisions from the army of
Jourdan. This reinforcement amounts to about
' 26,000 mt 11, besides several regiments â¢of cavalry, t
dragoons, infantry and hufF*rs, Thefc reinforce- ~
merits were necessary, because the Aufltians have,
j at this moment, near Frankfort a considerable ar " !
my which has been increafedby troops from the. j^ a[
' coips commanded by Arch-duke Charles. The j ~
- 1 " French and Austrian armies abandon, by degrees, j v â
3 the left bank to pass to the right, where matters '
are expected to have a fetious issue. Jourdan will j ( j )a[
' be in prrfon with'the army which is near the Lahn,
'* and will leave to Gen. Marceau the command of a
' corps of fcbfervation on the borders of the Nahe 5 j^ n(
r " tbis corps is destined principally to prevent the ene- â
my from making an attempt, during his absence Q g|
, into the Hundfruck. The head quarters oflhe ar-
' my' of the Sambre and Meufe, departed on the 24th
' ' from Munfter-Mainfield, to Neuwied, where the
mod part of she military administrations were al-
r ready. att .
, Since the bloody affairs of the 4th, sth and 6th j
IJ of this month, on the right bank of the Rhine, there
' have been no decisive engagements ; but every day ,
VC the patroles of cavalry have fkirmifiies, in which
the nre various. This fampui Aottrif"
Ut cavalry which passes for the firft of Europe,
" ord
not an urvtiuth, has often been beaten by an equal
V forc<of Republicans. If thefuccefs of the FÂ»ench
1 troops, however, has been rapid on the right bank
18 of the Rhine, it mult be acknowledged they have
!ln coll some flood. The towns of Cologne, Bonn, eft .
and Andernach are fi'led with wounded. They
:f " have carried them in great numbers into the villages
,Â°" situated betwixt the MeJfeand the Rhirjp.

-' ,Ths whole ot the army commanded by Gen. Jour- cq
dan, has quitted the to pais the Rhine,
""r and carry the theatre of war to the right bank of
Â° ihe'river. It is'on this account that the archduke
" et Charles has removed his army to cover Frankfort.
m " There arc no Austrian troops to covcr Mayence on )f

I? ' S polls on the point-, that rhey might carry all their
f " R orces to the right bank. Tfie army of Jourdan is
emcamptd on this fide of the Lahn, and that of the
30 . Auftrians is on the other. In this Sate of things,
it cannot be long before we hear of a general battle. cc

150 or 200 fathoms.
" The bravery of the army and the good con
daft of the chiefs and the general officers vanquifti
ed, in a (ho't time, all these nearly insurmountable
obfVacles. The troops up to the arm-pita in water,
and under the ftiarpeft fire of artillery and mufquet

and carried all the Works which defended thel'c in

' ! " The loss of the enemy is very considerable in
j killed and wounded ; I reckon the number not lef*
1 than 6or 700 msn. The time neceflary for con
' ftrufting bridges for the paflsge of our cavalry,
* prevented us from making a great number of pri

This Lottery will afford an elegant specimen of the pri
vate buildings to be erected in the City of Washingtonâ
Two beautiful designs are already feleyted for the entire
fronts on two of the public squares ; from these prawings
it is proposed to erect two centre and four corner buildings
as soon as poflible after this lottery is fold, and to convey
them, "when complete, to the fortunate adventurers, in
the manner described in the scheme for the Hotel Lottery.
A nett deduction of five per cent, will be made to defray
the necessary expenses of printing, &c. and the surplus
will be made a part of the fund intended for the National
University, to be erected within the city of Washington.
The Drawing will commence as soon as the tickets are
fold off.--The money prizes will be payable in thirty days
after it is finith.id ; and any prizes for which fortunate
numbers aie not produced within if,. â  .1...
drawing is doled, are to be conltdercd as given towdfdi
the fund for the University ; it being determined to fettle
the whole iufmefs in a year from the e itling of the draw
ing, and to take up the bonds giv?n as security.
l'he real securities given for the payment of the Prizes,
are held by the President ana two Dire&ors of the Bank
of Columbia, and are valued it more than half the a
mount of the lottery.
The twenty four gentlemen who by appointtnent of
the late Commissioners affiftcd in the management of the
Hotel Lottery are requested to undertake this arduous tafc
a second time on behalf of the public ; a fufficient num.
ber of these having kindly accepted, it is hoped that the
friends to a National University and the other federal ob
jeits may continue to favor the difign.
By accounts received from the different parts of the
Continent as well as from Europe, where the tickets
have been sent for faje, the public are allured that tin
drawing will fpe'edily commenae, and that the cart arid
caution unavoidably necelfary to insure a fafe disposal of
thÂ« tickets,has rendered the iaor fufpeaGonindifpenfabk.
