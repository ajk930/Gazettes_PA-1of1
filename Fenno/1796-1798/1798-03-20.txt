TUESDAY EVENING, 10.

Ml. Ft N NO,
In my last payer' I promised to endeavor
still lather to confute the idea Â»f our pre
tended fubtniffion to British injuries, being
-the true cause of the present behaviour of
France. I have to regret that my want of
kifu>-e does not permit roe to enter extensive-
Iy upon that subjeCt A dilmiflion from of
Â£Â«e has hot enabled me to devote my sole
attention to public affairs ; and had I ever
held an office, I ftiould nut have been base
and treacherous enough to prostitute the in
formation I received from it, to the purpofc
of destroying that government, by whose
patronage I had been supported. In these
refpeCta, the American merchant has an hon
orable advantage. I asked in my last paper
if the tamenefs we are said to have displayed
towards Great Britain was the real taufe of
French hunility, .whence it proceeded, that
the other neutral nation* are placed in the
fame predicament with ourselves ? I will
now fay noth'ng of the faith of a solemn
treaty by which France was bound to us and
whereby the conduCt fce ought to have pre
scribed to hcrfelF wa* clearly designated. I
vriil fay nothing of thÂ« injuitice of picking
Â»kc of a pockets becaufc the other
his ttready been robbed, and beeaufe he did
â ot immediately take vengeance on the thief.
I will nut retort upon the claims of grati
tudewhich (hehas so magnanimoafly advanc
ed, the obligation* (he lays under to us for
the anticipation in the payment us her.debts
whereby her armies *t a most distressing pe
riod were provided for, and her rcfources
increased ; but if such were really her mo
tives, I will only a(k wherefore it i* that a
much greater tamenef* toward* herftlf, has
not produced upon her counsels the fame ef
fect as a lef* degree did upon those of
Great Britain. In order to afcertaiu this
ft(t it will be neaeflary to bring into view
the circumitances under which the British
order for the seizure of our veflel* was issu
ed ; the elfeCt it had upon our conduCt and
the fubftqueut meafurcs of France.
The order was iflued immediately after
Great Britain must have heard of the arrival
cf Mr. Genet in this country, of the ac
clamations with which he was universally re
ceived ; cf his fitting out American priva
teers manned with American seamen, in wr
ier to 3nnoy her commerce, and of hi*
claiming a right tfhder the treaty to do so.
It was soon after Mi. Jeffeffon's report ap
em our commercial relations with foreign
powers and Mr. Madifon'* commcicial re-
Solution 3 founded upon that report whereby
our trade was to have been placed in the
hands of her enemy almost to her own ex
clusion. It was while oar citizen* in the
public papers, a?Td in their meetings, were
expressing the most pointed disapprobation
towards the combined powers and the most
livuy detronftrationa of affeCtion for the
â¢ aufe of France. It wa* done with a belief
rHot ifre government Rirglit
be to preserve peace, yet built as it was up
on the will of the people it could not long
refill their wlfhes. It was resolved upon at a
time when her minister here is well known
to have perlonal'y entertained the most ran
corous hatred towards ourgovernment, con
frftution and people, and therefore, at a
tin:; when the minds of her ministers must
have been poisoned by his rcpreftntation*.
These coniideratons do not indeed entirely
esculpate -her conduCt, .but it is proper to
glar.ce at them in order to prove that (lie had
no small reason to believe our view* were
hostile to her prosperity.
No fconer, however, Wa* the order known
in America, than mrafures of tho feve al
retaliation were propsfed. In the House
of Reprcfentatives a resolution for the non
imporutiou of British goods was aCtually
carried. The sequestration of Britifli debt*
was strenuously urged. The organization
ut our land force* was by all parties thought
proper,and an embargo was laid for the pur
pose cf starving the Britifli Weft-India isl
ands v hith was only taken Â«ff at the inftanee
us the.minister fr#m France. In this situ
ation of affairs Mr. jay was nominated as
our envoy to the court of St. James. In
the mefnige of the Prelldent to the Senate
upon that occasion he plainly intimated that
if justice was not done K> our complaints,
war ought to be the confcqueace. Under
the imprtffioii that if peace was not thus ta
be procured, a war would be commenced
with greater checrfulnefs and prosecuted
with greater vigor the Senate confirmed the
nomination. When Mr. Jay arrived in En
gland he was treated with respeCt and lieafd
with attention. A mode was pointed out
whereby rtdrefs might be obtained,, and a
treaty entered into which promised to main
tain harmony between the two nation*. If
this treaty has been in the remotest degree
the cause of our differences with France, it
has only been becanfe it secured peace with
England. I will not attempt to recount all
the injuries and insults of France. The tafit
i* too painful for the feelings of an Ameri
can. His mind turn* with loathing and dis
gust from the fnbject. His pen almost re
fufe* to pctfoioi hatrftd officeâA few
of them, howevt'r, it is peceCaty to menti
on. I will not speak of the influence and
open violence of Genet, wr of the more
secret artifices of his successor. I will only
begin with Mr. Adct's manifefto; this was
iffucd immediately before our late e'eCtion
for Preiident. A more direCt atterapt to
jnfluence the politics of one independent na
tion could hardly be made by aaother, for
at the momcut when France infiided what
(he was pleafcd to call this public stigma of
disapprobation, her emissaries were continu
ally working upon the minds of the people
by deelarisg that tke only mean of cfcapit: j
ftiil firtler n-k' of her difpitafure wa* the
( dcsi<iT. of Mr. jrfferf'irf. This marnfeflo
was filled with the most infaraocs, fal.e ana
zbommabie charges not only against the ex
ecutive but lcgiflative wsd judicial branches
of our government. Atcufirinot of in "
tict, treachery, and corruption blackene
the face of the whole performance and en
deavor* to separate the people from their
conilituted authorities were visible in every
page of it. Thi* iÂ», however, but ose part
of the degrading catalogue.
The minister who had been difpatehed for
thepurpofeof conciliation was treated with
contempt and driven from her territory.â
To the French revolution this gentleman had
al way* been most warmly attached, towards
the success of our own he had been eminent
'y service? M I No perfenal objection was
therffore to be made against him. That a
difmilficn of the minister of one country
from the territory of another is always eon
fidered aÂ» denoting a state of the moll deter
mined enncity,'et the conduCt of France her-.
felf prove. When Mr. Chauvelin was or-|
dered to quit Englaad, France immediately .
declared war. \
Our goverament still anxious to maintain
peace sent to France a new EmbafTy. Vain
ly hoping that by displaying to the whole
world our pacific disposition some alteration
might be produced in her councilsâno mea
sures were taken for the protection of our
(KiTiÃierce, none of any effect for the inter
nal defence of our country. The House of
Representatives recommended it to the Pre
fideat to offer to place her in all respeCts u
pou the faftie footing with Great Britain ;
to give to hfr the fame commercial privile
ges ; and to make no difference in the po
litical relations in which the two nations
should stand to ourselves. By doing so we
were to surrender any advantages secured to
ns by the faith of treaties ; we were again
to submit to all the pretended degradation
which the treaty with Great Britain had
already hrought uj on us ; and we were to
counteract any power given to that nation
/if any such had beer given) whereby flic
might injure France' by givng the fame
power to France with which to injure her.
Whatever ftreHgth had before been given to
our connexion with the one, was then to
have been equalled by Our treaty wieh the
others. Had not the Republic been actua
ted by the wildest ambition and the most ifi
iquitious fpiritoffelf aggrandizement, thtfe
concefÃons would hive done more than fati*-
fied her. But the rulers of her country
hare it seem* without definingtheir expecta
tions, without informing u*to what extent
even our degradation was demanded, again
To what grtaterlerigths they could havegone,
I have in vain endeavored to conceive. Was
it expe6ted thatthe representatives of the ma
jesty of a free and independent people would
enter the presence of the French ufiirpers in
the fighings of penitence and the moaning*
of dtfpair? Our tears of contrition would
have only caused laughter,' and the mean
ness which prodnced them would only have
caused deserved contempt.
That we are now reduced to the most aw
ful situation by the ambitfoti and violence of
Fnnce aided by, thtf efforts of her faCtir>us
and snprfiii'ipt'ip a '' t 'Â«Â» n * oKneidy
to allow. But we rauft not fink under the
evil. It ia one of those cases in which ex
ertion is the only means of fafety. If we
can aveid war with honour let us do so ;
that it is enc'ompafTed with danger and diffi
culty we well know ; but that it is often the
only way to avoid greater difficulty and
danger the principles of human nature and
the hiftorv of mankiad will prove. And
here let me observe that it is not by con
stantly holding Hp to a people the falfe i
mage of their weaknef* that they ever can
arrive at greataefs or glory. By degrading
them in their own eyes their spirit of enter
prize is extinguished, their faculties become
(hipified ; and it should be recolleCted that
with nations as with individuals the meafiire
of their power is unknown until it it called
into aCtion. It was Roman fortitude that
established Roman independence. It was
by overlooking small evils that file was en
abled to smile at the attempts of her ene
mies at length to overcome them all j and it
is only by (hewing-to the world a firm de
termined spirit of refiltance to oppression ;
aa unlhaken resolution in support of our
rights to part with life, fortune, and fami
ly ; it is, only by the real patriots of our
country binding themselves to eaeh other
by all the ties of common interest, affcCtion
and danger that our liberties can We once
more secured from usurpation.
Let then the " American Merchant" and
his afibciates beware, let them (top ere it is
too late, let them flee, persuaded that if
France succeeds in her nefarious fehemes
they will only enjoy the sorry priVlrgeof
being the last to be devoured ; and let him
cfpecially recolleCt that when treason isbro't
to the bar of Jufticc, it has not always the
plea of youthful folly wherewith to excite
companion or to procure mercy.

Mr. Fin no,
I Canuot refrain from calling the pablic
attention to an inftanee of wickedness in the
conduCt and avowed sentiments of a news
paper Editor, more inhuman in itfelf, and
daring in its manner, than any thing per
haps to be found in the deteflable records e
ven of French profligacy.
x\Â«counts were some time ago given in ail
the nrwfpapcrs of the (hocking murder of
the officers and many of the people on board
of the Heimione Britiffi frigate, by a part
of the crew, corapofed fit' wretches from
duicrent nations, who afterwards carried the
fliip into a Spanish port.
The comrr.ou impulse of nature held forth
the bloody perpetrators to public abhor
rence ; ar.d it was the general hope that tke
nation to which they had deserted would do
justice to themfdvet and to the world by de
liveriW up a g.ng of vÂ«kii.gm,rdrrers VbÂ« :
had inched then, wit* the.r
In one of Bathe's papers ut ,

ledged before a Magnate that th.y

of the mutiny, but denied be,concerned
in the hoi rid aÂ«Â», committed by a part o
the crew" ; and that they had been com
mitted to New-Brunfwick Jail. He the
dates, in the form of remarks from a cor
respondent, referring to Callender Â« History
of the Uniud States for eÂ»tdenee, that twÂ«
thirds of the Hermione'* crew were unprel
fed Americans ; and proceeding upon this
ftippofed fact, so injuriou. to the American
charaftrfr, he puhlifhes dedarej to the
world the following abominable and brutal
fentimei.t*. , . -
" When the writer of this article " r ''
| Â« heard of the extirpation of the officer! 01
i " this execrable cotfair, he felt that intciile
| Â«' fitisfaclion which every man mud feel who
Â«' wishes for the liberty of American sea
Â« men. What buliuefs our gorernmen:
" have to interfere in apprehending the ac
Â« tors of this mof audable enterprizc nobo
"dy gan gnefs. We sincerely wish that ev
" ery ship which imprefles American sea
" men, or indeed any fsamen, maybe served
<â¢ in the fame way. These men deftrye a gold
" medal or a penfton rather than ittprifon
" ment."
This wretched creature here avows the
" intense fatisfaftion" he felt fÂ«i hearing of
a deed which chills the foul with horror.
He calls it " an sxtirpation of officers," and
" a mod laudable cnterprize." He prays
that officers who have ever impressed," any
feamtn" (even of their own country aad in
obedience totheir orders) mayallbe so mur
dered at sea, by their own men. He ex
prefles his adonilhment that the magistrates
of this country should imprison men who
have performeji furf) meritorious services,
two thirds of whom he has described to be
Americans ; and fuggeds, in the spirit of
a legislator for the encouragement of aflaf
fins, that they (hould rather be rewarded by
a gold medal or a penlion.
If it is possible to punish the savage who
ean thus lecture on the merit* of the fouleft
murder, and inculcate wickedness of fuÂ«h
aggravated eiormity as a duty of public
spirit,, let him, in the name of all that is
due to national charafter and virtue, or dear
to humanity, be delivered over to condign
punifhmeHt. But if unhappily the arm of
the law is incompetent, let the feelings of
every hontft American be appeased by the
general exprfffioa of indignation aÂ«d sorrow
that thoughts and principles of such unpa
ralelled proligacy <hould be publiihed to the
world in an American newspaper.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. '
Mowday, March 19.
MR. D. FOSTER, from the Committee I
of Claims, made an unfavourable re- J
port on the petition of G. B. Froli, and thole L ,
of several others, who seek fÂ»r a renewal of t
Loan Otfice Tickets, Land Warrants, Lottery j
Tickets, Â«c. which have been loft. There- /
port was committed for Wednesday.
A melfage was received from the President f
of the United States, infbrming the Hoiife j
that he had'approved and signed the Act tor t
the fitpportof Government for the year 1798, t
and for other purpose the Ait provid- t
ing the means of intercourse with Foreign t
Nations. v
At the fame lime was communicated thÂ« c
following' important meflage in writing.
(Seeyefltrday's Gazette.) a
This metlage was referred to the Committee r
of the Whole on the State of the Union.
The House again resolved itfelf into a Com- *
mittee of the Whole on the Bill supplementa
ry to, and in alteration of the Aft for the re
lief of persons ifli]3rifoiied fordebtâana alter
some difculjion, the committee rose, and the '
Bill wasTifCommittecl to a Seleft Committee.
On motion #f Mr. Craik, the House went F
into a Committee of the Whole on the Bill
making an appropriation for completing the 3
buildings neceflary for thÂ« accommodation of
the Government at the city of Washington. }
The Bill having been read, '
Mr. GaalatA moved to fhike out the c
words " for completing the building*," in 01- 3
der to insert the fame words which were used v
in the original AÂ£t for eftablilhing the perma
nent Seal of Government, viz. " forprovid- f
ing suitable buildings for the Government of r
the United States." Hisobjeit in this amend- j
ment was, not to give any fanflion to the 1
buildings now going on for government in the c
city of Walhington, and obliges the Commif- e
fioners, under the direction of the President '
of the United States, to proceed infinilhing
them, however improper they may deem )
them for the purpose. He wished, on the con- 1
trary, to leave the Commissioners and the Pre- <
(idem at full liberty either to go on with the
present buildings, or to prepare others upon
a more suitable ana economical plan.
Mr. C&AIK had no objeiiion to this Â»-
mendinent, and it was apcordingly carried.
The committee rose, and the bill was or
dered to be read a third time to-morrow.
Oti motion of Mr: D. Fo sts b., the house 1
resolved itfelf info a 'â orfimittee of th* Â«j.Â»_ j
pp ttia fypnrfc Â»|- I > nrv-. to ,
whom was referred the petitions of Samuel
Abbot and others, John Bennet, in behalf of
himfelf and Abraham Sutton, Samuel Edy,
Francis Guillori, Thomas Rothe, Lemuel
Snow, Joshua Whitney, by Timothy Wihn,
his agent, and Thomas Wells, the
read as follows:
" That the objefi of these petitioners is to obtain
from the public,, the arrears of pay, &c. due them
for their services during the last -war. Their ac
counts -were duly and properly liquidated ; certi
ficates for their refpe'clive balances, were tffued
by the proper commiffiener, and deposited in the
hands, of the regimental agents, pursuant to an aft
ofCongrefs of the third day of November 1783.
Hut the petitioners alledge that they never receiv
ed their certificates, by reason of tie default of the
' agents of the regiments, to which they refpeClively
belonged.
" The committee having been inflrutted to re
port on thisJubjefl, generally, have not confined
their enquiries to the special merits of the indivi
dual claims but have conjidered it with abievu
to all who arc Jimilarly circumflanced, and alike
unfortunate.
By the eflabl'tfbment for the army, made by
Congress, on tbei-jth of May, it ivas direc
ted, " that the pay mailer of a regiment be ckofcn
by the officers of the regiment, out of the cap
tains or subalterns ; and that she officers fbould â 
risque their pay in their hands." Every officer be
ing thus interefled in the ability and integrity of the
agent, as ivell as on his own account as on ac
count of the soldiers, was an infpeftor of the con
duet of 1 he' pay-maker. The choice was generally
good ; there were but few well grounded com
plaints again ft the persons appointed; and for those
prompt, and probably judicious remedies, were
admiftcred by courts-martial.
" At the end of the war it became expedient
to dijband the army, whom the United States
could not then pay without even delivering to
the individuals the evidences of the debts respec
tively due to them for their services.âAccording
ly, on the third of November 1783, Congress re
solved, " That the paymaster general defqfit in
the hands of regimental agents the certificates for
the arrears of pay due to rite officers and soldiers of
their refpeftl've lines ;tobe by them delivered to
the individuals to whom they belonged, or deposi
ted for their benefit, as the supreme excutiue of
tbejlate to which the respective agents belonged,
fbould direct.
" The last mentioned resolution is silent as to the
mode of electing regimental agents. In pursu
ance of a general order, the agents were appoint
ed by a majority of the officers of each regiment,
as in the cafe of the regimental pay matters. They
were therefore to be considered as the legal repre
sentatives of the commillioned officer j ; but the
ion commijftoned officers and privates, neither vo
ted, nor were they consulted in the choice ; they
could not of Voarfe equitably be made answerable
for the fidelity if tin said agents. Some of those
agents proved unfaithful to their trufls, and some
of the non-commtfjioned officers and privates, have

drawn from the Carnp at St. Roche, ap
pears premature. The troops ?re, however I
in an inactive, states, and seemingly have no
of hostile co-operation. The Spmifh
gun-boats very much aunoyed the English
veflels on entering the Bay, and although
there was much vigilance and exertion on
the part of the enemy, yet the Britifk inter

It it understood that Government have
determined to abandon the whols of ost

when the horft inftant'.y ftised it in h Jmouth
and'held it there for more than a minute,
in despite of all the endeavours ef tivo

was, that Sir Henry was compelled te fuffer
an amputation of all his fingers from that

BE ATE OF COL. FITZGERALD.
(FROM THE DUBLIN
Thedeceafed feeling no remorse for the
difbonor in which he had involved an illuf
triout family, had the hardihood to follow
the young- lady to Ireland, it is supposed
wi:h a view to wrest her by violence from
her psreuts, and took lodgings at an inn in
Kilworth. He had keen there fame days
fcelfcrc his arrival at Kilwort'n was known,
or the objeft of his expedition was discover
ed. He was obfarved to walk out in the
night and conceal bimfelf in the day, and
thÂ« fervanrs at length noticed him lurking i
about Mitcheliown koufe 2t uafcafooable
hours.
The intelligence having reached Lord
Kipgfisorough, who had had the duel with
the eolonel, aid rc (olving to defeat his an
tagonist's projeA, he left his fat bet's boÂ»fe,
and repaired to Kilworth, where having in
quired tor the colonel, he was dire&cd to
the apartment in whieh he was lodged:
Lord Kinglborough rapped at the door, re
quiring admittance; the other, knowing
his voicp, replied that be was locked in, and
could not open the door, but if he had a
ny thing to fay to him, he would receive
it in writing under the doÂ®r.
This enraged the ye ting Nobleman, and
he torced op on the door, and, running to a
caf-af pistols hi the room, desired the eol.
to take one and.defend himfrlf, for he was
refalvcd to have fatisfadlion foi; the feheme
the deceased had formed againd his filler,
and which he came to this place to pnt in
execution. On both feiaing the pifUlj,
they -grappled with each other, and were
-ftrugglirg, when the Earl of Kingston,
who had been apprized of his foil's depar
ture in pursuit of the colonel, and quickly
followed the young lord, entered the ro'om,
and finding them in the contest, and that
his son mufl lose his life from the situation
the deceased had him in, the Earl fired, and
die colonel fell.
ANOTHER ACCOUNT.
" Cork, Dtt. 10. O-l. Fâ d had been
tot some days lurking in the neighborhood
cf Mitchelftown, in order, as supposed,
to fee the unfortunate young lady he lately
debauched. She has been for some time
at her father's house in that place. Lad
night, at an early hour, he went to bed at
an inn in Kilwor h, requeuing to be called
when the mail coach pafTtd, at eleven. A
coach came to the door, in which were call
K and lord K , father and broth
er to th* iinh lppy ft male, with two atten
dants, all Â»riÂ¥ied"; * arm I'Hu Him g.u. J.i
the flairs, the two former went into thr
room, and the brother, it is reported, (hot
him dead in bed. They came down flairs,
and immediately drove off : on the Dublin
road they were met near Cionmell. The
coroner is gone from hence this mÂ«rning,
but the verdift has not reached us. The
ball entered hialtfi bread, by the heart."
The lamentable fate of capt. Parker, of
the Intrepid, brother to rear admiral Sir !
William Parker, at present at Lisbon, pro
ceeded from the most extraordinary cireum
ftancet perhaps on record. In a gale of
wind off the Cape, the (hip labored much ;
and in a lee lurch, the chair, on Â«.Thich he
fat giving way, he fell with such violence
against otie of the port-holes as t'o force
the sash, and with it fell from his cabin in
to the sea. The Intrepid, as soon as pos
sible, hove to, but too late for his deliver
ance.
The whole of the Venetian fleet, in the

We are amused here with an expedition 1
to Manilla. The Spanish force there is four c
fail of the line, three of them many years f
in the country (I believe ever since the Noot- h
ka Sound bufir)efs) the fourth lately out ; i
five or fix frigates and gun-boats. They h
have about 2,500 regular troops, and per- 1
haps three or four thousand militia and ir- ?
regulars : of these I make little acconnt. J,
We can fend a force from this prefldency, j
withont tailing any frtim Bengal, that I d
think will ensure fucoefs ; so that unltfs o
peace tskes place, you may calculate on the *
expedition going forward in about fix or fe- ''
ven weeks. Admiral Raynier will by that *
time colledl his force ; and as he is always _
ready, there will be np delay in that efTen- i 0
tial department. The troops are also fta -! t!
tioned all along the coafl. It is not yet fix- ' ft

lafl came out, will, in a reasonable time, be jj'
equal by the care, r.eal and attention of j J
their commandants and officers; these are,
the t2th, 19th, 33d, 78th, and 80th in- â bj

some years in the country are, titc 36th, j ** l
52d, 71ft, 72d, 731, 74th, 75, 76th

dragoons, lately arrived, niuft have much
time to get in ordtr ; and the want of, and
difficulty in getting and training horses, will p r
keep them unfcrviceable for some time, vi!
The cavalry corps in the company's service
are in great perfedion, particularly in the tJ
