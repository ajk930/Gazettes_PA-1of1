Fellow Citizens,,
New year's eve is approaching, when it is
feared that the idle praftice which has for
he some time past prevailed in the city and li
he berties of Ihooting aut the old year, and
:e. Ihooting in the new one, as it is absurdly
cn called, will be repeated, which has often
been attended with dangerous and alarming
consequences. Therefore every legal endea
vor should be used to check the evil and to
. _ fupportthe violated laws-os our country in
on this instance so frequently insulted. 'Die
ck citizens are earnestly requested to leud their
afMance to bring to punilhment the offen
ders ; and the constables and watchmen are
!)' particularly enjoined to be vigilant and ac
tive, in arreftingfuch daring violators of the
public peace. Jt is fincerelv to be hoped
that the civil officers and otli; r p;ood citizens
of in the county will afTift the city police to
Jn carry into effeft so uleful n regulation,

Mr. FennO, . t Ji
IN your paper of the 27th instant, I have 01
seen certain publications, signed' by John b!
Jjoyle, J. Milnor,'Atchefon Thompson, and fe
7 /hn Sparks, containing an account of some ' fp
of the proceedings of the late Alexander ! hi
Philips, during the time the Deborah was ab
riding quarantine ; which, in foine refpe&s, or
are contradi&ory to the account published by m:
me, and appear evidently to have been pub- so
lifhed at the instance of some person opposed co
to the foreign origin of the difeat'e, and per- ex
lnps by one whom a fair display of the truth, m
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, fa!
would fubjea not only tn censure and the all
odium of the inhabitants of this city, but to th
the penalty annexed to a breach of duty, de
That the contagion which gave origin to ne
the Yellow fever, was introduced into this he
city last year by the Arethufa from the Ha- an
vanna, and the prelent year by the Deborah, th
there are proofs " strong as those of holy or
Wrlt -" , Pa
Let those who still doubt, only have pati- ga
ence a few days, till the fads and observations th
of the College of Physicians, which are now th
in the press, come out; there, a damning fh
paper will appear which will make every A
delinquent tremble. an
In tlie mean time I beg leave to remark, wi
th-it even admitting that I was mistaken in an
part of the evidejice received from the per- pa
sons whose names have been just mentioned, wi
all that those men have laid amounts merely I ;
to this, that they did not know of Philips's de
bringing any person, either sick or well, to I
his house, from the Deborah ; but this is ne- na
gative evidence, and pitiful trifling with a of
question which is supported by the most re- kii
fpefuble and positive teftimonv of Mr. Ny
Thomas Town and Mr. John Purdon, the
latter of whom has ever adhered to truth
with the most rigid exaftn-fs. And both of
fl.efe men have declared, in the moltexprefs
terms,- that Philips himfelf told them that
he l;ad brought up one or more lick perlbiis
â¢ with him.
That he went down to the Deborah, ap
pears from his conversation with Mr. Doyle's
wife, and from his conversation with Mr.
Sparks, from whom he pvrchalVd liquors on
the 10th of July, which was the 2d day of
the Deborah's quarantine. What were Mr.
or Doyle's reasons for withholding other parts
j- of information, which he has lince commu
ii(j nicatcd to Doilors Currie, James and Cath
, ral,-are l)eft knowÂ» to himlelfi His words
were, " Philips being foiled in his expecta
tions of getting on board the Deborah, aftep
a wards went down by land to the Hospital,
to with clothing for one of his lodgers then
â¢ confined in the Hospital, which he handed
through the gate to some person, as they
would not grant him permission to enter the
t house." Atchefon Thoinpfon also foiemnly
r * declared, in the presence of the lame gentle
men, that he fav/ two of the belonging
to the Deborah in Alexander
Philips, in the the 28th July,
the fame evening that Alexander Morrifon
died at his house. '/"his Morrifon had 110
phylkian to attend him at all, but was seen
by Dr. Currie an hour after his decease, who
thought he had died of convulliojjs, as it
was not at that time known that the Yellow
.j fever had made its appearance in that cityâ
excepting in the instance communicated by
Dr. Proudfit, and which the Board of Health
(being better acquainted with diseases !) pro
nounced to be a mistake. The fame R< ard
ft afterwards appointed a carter to attend the
r sick in the Northern Liberties,
p If Thompson's teftimpny is to overrule the
I. declaration of Dr. Dori'ey and Currie who
r attended and questioned the man before he
y became delirious, tlien adieu to certainty,
i but as those gentlemen can not be presumed
f to have any interest in the matter diflindl
froin that of tlje red of the citizens, as they
have no chara&er to lose by the efhblilh
ment of the truth, the v;hole truth ; I am
inclined to think their tefliinony ought not
to be rejected.
The disease was evidently communicated
j rom sick carpenter at Thompson's to
I Mr. D. Jamie, clerk to Mr. Foster, v/ho
1 lodged in tiie fame room", and tied on his
neckcloth the day he was removed to the
1 hospital ;~and also to Thompson's child, a
hired girl and a inantua maker. A lodger
; at one Payes who helped down with the
, corpse cf Morrifon also took the disease a
few days after.
That Phillips had a man sick at his house
when lie was taken ill himfelf is evident from
the testimony of Dr. Griffins, and 1 believe
the rtjftlice ot Dete&or himfelf, â vWth nil his
ingenuity at perverting and diiguifing the
truth Will not charge him with fnifreprcfea-
I tation. For farther confirmation of what
I have advanced, I (hill wait for the publi
cation of the college of phyficiar.s to which
I refer, and am your much-obliged and very

IT is with' much fatisfa&ion I obfen"e :
the furpriling change that has.taken place in 1
the ccr.d'jft of this paper. From being the ]
mischievous engine of a desperate fafcion, it 1
haj become a harmless and diverting vehicle 1
of absurd abuse ; âalthough it has ever 1
groaned under a load of fallhood, virulence '
and sedition ; yet the art and address, the de- !
lufive appeals to the pffions of the ignorant, 1
and to the hopes of the needy, which were
intermixed, gave some influence to its poi- I
fonous effortsâbut is now chang- i
ed ; and we find flat and palpable falthoods, j
too barefaced to deceive a child, and person- 1
ai abuse too grofe and I'oathfome, even to (
gratify envy and malice, fubrtituted fgr the t
cunning of the former editor. I read nhe (
Aurora with the fame kind of feeling and'di- t
version that I (hould listen to a Thames wa- 'i
terman blackguarding some pafling boat, in j
the general lingo of the place, without the t
least expectation or prefpeit of injuring the t
I character of the person attacked. Citizen t
Jasper is not the man I took him for I f
thought he was a cunning, wicked, danger- Â«
knave, but I find him an insffenfive
blackguard ;âI could take up a doren suCh
fellows at a bawdy house frolic ; and a few
special ones perhaps that could, beat him in
his own way. I hope then I (hall hear no ,
about the dangerous tendency of the Aurora
or the wickedness ot poor Jafpej. Let any J
man of tolerable good nature, and not under A
some particular chagrin, look over the third k
column of the Aurora of this-morningâif it
excites resentment in his breast I am much
mistaken ; there is a kind of easy impudent
fallhood throughout, so er.tirfly r.-gardlefs of it
all decency or colouring, that the novelty of P
the design gives a kind of phd'ure to the rea
der of curiosity in ftileâfor instance, Â« a
new_ carpet was placed on the floor of tht
house of Representatives for the reception of, C
and in compliment to Dr. Logan,'"' when
that very house by a majority of more than 1
one third, in their address to the Prffident. si
palfed a severe and spirited cehfure on Lo
gan's ridiculous and wicked'cmbafTy. In
the fame manner of dine ft fallhood, and in v
the fame page, the frefident, Mr. P.ckc-- Ct
ftig, Wolcoft, M'Henry, Morris, Kin,,
Adams, Otis, Foster, Grifv/old and Smitii,
are served up . for different purposes, but m
without the lead injury to thfir charafters ; lr
and, as I almost believe from the face of the
paragraphs, without any intention, lurcly C
without any expeftation of injuring them
lam told the Aurora is so hampered with J
debt and difsrrace, that it must soon fink â¢
I hope the federal men who wish to fee their
names recorded as the friends and fupoorters
of their government, will give it a liftâthis
kind of abuse is certainly honorable teftimo- 1
ny to their merit. ei

jn in the manifeftation of a public sentiment of
no approbation and confidence. And as a new
en means of keeping alive the martial spirit

.1 trom thÂ«ir governmentâMr. R. thought
r this a good measure of national defence :
1 and he declared that he had seen nothing in
the address of the President, nor in any thi.g
else which could influence the mind of the
molt fanguinelegiflator to weaken his
lor effeitive measures of defence. If our
profpeas had brightened at all, it was en
tirely owing to the energy and wisdom which
directed the meafurcs would be taken to pre
\enc our citizens from holding any improper
mtercourfe with foreign governments
Mr. Gallatin. â¢It has been said by gen
tlemen who support this rrfalution'; that ir
has no reference to any thing which has taken
place. It may be so; but although it has
no reference to what has already been done,
those gentlemen will not fay that such a re
solution would have been brought forward,
unless a certain event-had taken place. This
will not be denied. It is therefore proper,
said he, before we enter into this business,
that we lliould have iome information on
the fubjedl; and this information the house
had a right to fmce the President
had promised it at the commencement of the
leflion. He conceived this proper, because
if the house were to legislate upon so novel
a lubjeft, in order to prevent 'futiire injuries
to the United States, they ought firft to know
how the injury which gave rife to the mea
sure, has been committed. But, said Mr.
G. if this proportion is brought before the
house on the ground of general legislation,
it is. extremely improper in itfelf. He would
not deny that there might be an interference
with the executive authority of the United
States, which it wcruld be proper to punish
y law ; flill less was he difpofcd to deny,
t .at men who should embark in foreign ag
grefTions against this country, and men who
should attempt to subvert the constitution,
S n a 'd, ought to be liable to puhifh
men-t ; and such, he was pretty confident,
are already liable to punishment.
But, said-Mr. G. let us examine the refo.
lution. It is not intended in the least to
cover this ground. It propefes only to pro
e punishment for such persons as /hall at
tempt to check the negociations of the Execu
tive. Nothing is here said about aggression ;
Â» ut only to provide punishment for such
p< nons.as {hall uforp the-Executive autho
rity, by commencing or carrying on anycor
refponder.ee with any foreign government,
rebtive toexifting controveriieS or disputes.
n tne firf 1 place,, he would a(k how gentle*Co-id-fair" ci'm-'tng on any ctrresfrm
dente," an a-Lt-nf ufurpition over thr ,' cecu
t{ve author;tv ? The gentl -man from .South
Carolina had said, that this was ;is much an
ufu" "jStron of Executive authority, as it
viHiJd be juÂ» ufiirpjtion of the Judicial au
for a set of unauthorized p.-rluns to
â  osqA thernf-lres the power of trying
Mxa G. did not think the two cases
jus : but he would slate a cafe with
relpitt to individual proceedings,in his Opi
nion, perfectly litrjar. Sappofe, i'aid he, I
i- l a.law suit with an individual, and' a third
rerfon, unauthorized by me, should write a
jetter to my adversary, with a view of pro
curing a reconciliation betwixt us; this would
be an exactly finiitar cafe. He could not
conceive how a man who has no power of
attorney, can usurp the Executive authority.
He may be guilty of high crimes and misde
meanors ; he toy do 'very improper aft' ;
but he could not usurp the Executive autho
rity.
Again, the resolution fays, that any per
son who (halt usurp the Executive authority,
by carrying on any correspondence with a fo
reign government. The proposition here
coYersfar too much ground. He would sup
pose a merchant, or owner of a veflel, whole
property had been plundered by the vellels
of u foreign government, were to enter into a
correspondence with that government lor the
reparation of his property. Would gentle
men v/ifh a person of this description to be
punished ? Certainly not; and vet he would
certainly come within the meaning of this
resolution. He would go further, and sup
pose an American citizen, who shall neither
h: a merchant or the owner of a vessel, should
apply to any branch of a reign government,
to desire an embargo might be taken off, or
some old debt paid, and alk whether such a
person ought to be punished ?
If it were intended to cover all cases of
this kind, the resolution does not go far
e;iaugh. It only embraces Ctileiof " contro
versy and dispute." It ought to extend to
aft objefts of negociation with foreign pow
ers, as an interference in any would be e
quallv an ufurpition of executive authority;
â  and a citizen of the United States whe flia.ll
enter into any negociation with the govern
ment of Great Britain on the l'ubjedt of re
newing that part of our treaty with them
which will at a certain period expire, would
furelyb- as guilty, as one who should corrcf
â  pond with the republic of France on the fuh
jfift <>f P- a ee. Both cases, if either, are
equally usurpations of executive authority.
Mr. G. thought, therefore that this reso
lution, in some refpedts, covered too much
ground ; in other?, too little. He beFieved,
however, that the criminality of any ofthefl
adts did not lie in their being usurpations of
the-executive authority, but in the nature of
the crime fcommitted.
There is, said he, another difficulty in 3us
relolution. In the general manner in which
it is brought before the house, it is quite a
novel fubjedt of legillation. All nations pu
nish citizens who carry an correspondences
of a criminal nature with foreign govern
ments. Of this nature would be an invita
tion of ,a foreign power to invade a country.
I luis, to-add one inftmce more to those ad
â lriced- tr)-1' ; :â).'.LutiL-'rtuVi r, â +". â  i
he would mention the tfofe of Switzerland,
where the armies of France were called in by.,
eertaiii individuals to ovemiu the countryâ
The resolution ought, therefore, to be macL
general, and confined to cases of a crimin .1
nature. H? did'not' know that anv nation \
ever passed a law to punish persons for hold
ing a correspondence with foreign Rovern
inents. He believed in certain fituatioys
such a correspondence would be highly im
proper. In our situation, for inftancr, said
bej it would be extremely improper for a
. merr ber of this house into anyco -
:â¢ relpomlenct with the French republic, be
cause this country is at pfefent in a peculiar
situation ; for though we are not at wa>
vith I- ranee, -an offfuce of this k!ind would
not be high treason, yet it woufd be as crj
niinal an aft," as if we were at war ; .but, a> '
he had already dated, the nature of the cor
respondence mult conftltute the crime, and
not tlie aft of correspondence. Thus, om
C'mititution has said, to adhere to the ene
mtes of the United States, and to afford
them atdand comfort, is treason : but as we
are not at war with France, an adt of this
kind gould not be treason. It migtit there
fore; be declared, that though a crime of
thiÂ» kind cannot be considered as treason, it
(ho.ukl ncverdielefs oe considered as a high
crime. Not that he was convinced, it was
Proper to le.;iilate upon the fubjedt at all
ut if at all it ought to be upon the natur
of.the uuriev
Bnt with-refpeft'to the conduft of an in

â¢ jTiscf accommodation to ourgovernment
fs it persuaded \vould be accepted, he saw
ling either criminal or improper in fuel

'â â¢â¢'â  had existed, he could not at prefenf
â !Â» a., ! tp wanted information upon the sub-
K- , out ii there had, he would fay, he
â¢â¢nu.#/nt there was nothing in his conduft

J' ln2 cuu ld not fubferibe to the o
'"iitM l -' ITfntlmian from Pern'fylvatiia,
c 'e relolution before the house is either
(â¢<â¢ improperly expt*fled. That j
the V- Wrm ,f cem fullv to understand !
P 1 :t-of. the words used. He objedts
to the â ftr-id usurpation, jjo other
word could hive been use 1 with so much
propriety. It was not intended, by this re
solution, t- provide againit all correspon
dence with foreign governments, but against
such only us ought to be carried on by the
executive ; and when an individual under
takes to correspond in fucli a manner, it is
then, and th -n only, that he ui'urps the ex
ecutive authority. The .vord is, therefore,
a necefhry part of the general definition of
ther efolut'ion. In the detail? of the law, it
might be said more particularly in what this
ufurp,ition should conlift ; and the gentleman
from Penti fylvania himfelf cannot deny, that
all usurpations ot the executive authority
ought to be punished, and this is all that i's
proposed by the relolution. Tlie gentleman
fays, a correspondence ought to be judged
of by its nature, which alone rendered it
criminal, or otherwrfc." This, opinion eve
ry one nnift fubferibe to. And what are
the correspondences mcft likely to be crimi
nal ? 1 he geutleman object to the cafe ivhich
has been alluded to being criminal ; yet he
allows it might be proper, in our present fo
liation to punish perfous who ihould corres
pond with tire French government.
Mr. Gallatin said, he had made use of the
words " afford aid and comfort." Â»
Mr. D. thought the gentleman had spo
ken As he had Rated. At any rate, said he,
thispofition is true ; and this unauthorised
correspondence must have led to an opinion
in the French government that they had nu
merous friends in this country, and have en
couracked them in their measures aL'3 nil us.
Mr. D. thought the >i fiance which the
gentleman from Pt fylvania had alluded to
of an indvidua 1 writiutj a le ter, was hot in
i point. He would give him one, i hR opin
ion, m.ugh more so. Whtre wo hostile ar
mies are in tl-e Seld, the general officer who
fuffers his troops to neg ciate with the ene
my would not, he believed, beconfidered as
either very careful or fkilful. But the gen
tleman from Pt-n fylvania has fuppofeo that
very worthy individual might carry on a'
correfpondi nee with a foreign government
to as to deserve praise, instead of censure. It
is pofiib'e, indeed, great and eminent cha- :
redtcrs, whose individual opinions might be
known to have great weight in this country
âthat of Generai Wafhingtsn, for inftmce
âmight be much refpedted in Europe ; but
my great and refpedtable chnradter, who re
garded the honour of his country, \vho filled
a great space in the view of mankind, would
nevei go a road in an obfeurt, mean, and
fly manner, without the knowledge of his
own government, to fettle differences with a
f reign nation. Could' there be found, in
deed, an individual without any public cha- j
redter, or reputation for public services, who
would be willing to go on such an errand,
very man of sense must laugh at the ridicu
lous vanity of such a man. No individual
of America ; no individual, undistinguished
by eminent fervice9, if he had the ordinary
abilities of the American charadter, would
ever undertake such an Embassy ; if he did,
lie would certainly be defpifedfor the weak
ness Â«f his intellects and his inflated vanity ;
befidcs being considered as having some other
:bj-Â£Lin vica-and. as, making thic a pat rn..
ver tor'tfrtPr deTTgns. Mr/0. would" not
disgrace the American character by fuppo
iing that fuch a man-could jjp found ;
lull ar. one woiild merit being confined in a
mad house, and be supposed to go .forward
as agent of a Fund) Fa&ion m this country.
( If the gentleman from Pen does
not like this term, he'rmifl give him ano
ther ; it exprtffed his own idea.) And in
every infta ce of thiskird the person thus
employ. d, mull be considered as adting in
direct holVility with the authority of onr go
vernment, ard against ilie general charadt
er of ourcou' try. It is proclaiming to the
enemy, the division of your country. It is
a crime o feri< us magnitude, as the person
thus adting, m id be considered as the agent
of a faction, waiti *g only-for an opportuni
â  jr-of joining the enemies of their . country.
He did not believe luch a fadlion has really
exi.te-icc. He knew thcrehad been reports
to this effedt, which had placed a man high
in rank in this government at its head ; but
he could not believe in his place that men
in so exalted a fitiiation could be guilty of
such conduit ; he was not atithorifed to li
tlen to any such suggestions and therefore
would not. . .
The gentlemen from Penfylvania suppo
sed the house ought not to-legiflate os this
fubjedt, until they receive information from
he President relative to our foreign affairs ;
i-.ut as this was intended as a general pnovi
i ;ipn, unconnedted with any particular cafe,
t was whol y unnecessary, in his opinion, to
wait for t is communication.
Mr. Pirckney said, he should not have
roublcd the house on occasion, had it not
een for the dodtrine which had fallen from
the gerttlem n from Virginia (Mr, Nicho
* as) which he considered as extremely dan
g rous in a republican government, and
which had a tendency to fubveit all order
and good government under wh tever from
they may exist. If he understood the gen
tieman rightly, he said, " he (hould not be
jfhamed ol having been concerned in any
f.cgociation which has la ely taken place
provided he had, by that means, obtained
neace from this couutry; and that he be*
lieved the people of this country would be
jti fnd with such an embassy, provided
peace was the result." He thought this
loCtrine fubverfivc of every principle of re
publican governnreut, the great and leading
doflrine of which is, that the sense of the ma
jority shall govern ; t'*at when this sense is
proclaimed by the proper organs, it shall
be absolute; that no one can pretend to in
terfere so as to counteradt the
of the people of this cou t>y as e>.prcff. d
by its legal organ?. This d dtrine fa d Mr.
P. cannot be controverted. He believed
the gentleman's good intentions for the peace
of the country, had mi/led his better judg
ment. Peace is is m'ft welcome
to every country, and highly tffcntial to its
welfare, This wilh of the gentleman for
j eace may have induced bis better judg
ment to have brought forward a sent intent
more prejudicial than the hittereft war.
Upon what principle it it. laid Mr. P..
that an individual should interfere in -he gen
eral management cf the affair* of this coan
try, even to procure pence to it ? It mud be
upo.. the ground that his private fentimenta
ought io prevail over the legal government
of his country; and it would not be confin
ed to the idea of giving peace trt the coun
try; bec-ufe of the opinion of this individu
al, or of any party, that the country ought
to t i war, the fame reafonirig would hold
good; fioce it willl>e thought we benefi
cial, at some times, to enter into war than
to remain at peace. Tunes may comeâ â
th:y have come in all couotrieiâ when it
will be more tffential to engage in a war,
under all its disadvantages that to remain at
peace.
Mr. P. knew of no cafe, no situation, in
which it could be lawful or right for an in
dividual to interfere with a foreign govern
ment at the time when any negociation is
going forward by legal authority. Such ar.
interference can have but a bad effe& ; it
mav have very bad effefts. It (hews at
lea (I, that there is a party in the country
divi ed from the government, who take up
on themfcKes a separate negociation, and
set up a diftindt power, which they wilh to
he paramount to the leijal authority.
He did not think the gentleman from
Virginia had formed a correct idea of the
f ntim nls of he American peoule, when
hefaid, he believed, on his return from an
unanthorifed em'osffy, of the kind alluded
to he should have received their thanks for
havin; given pface to their country. Uider
the present circumfta'icc, he thought the
Utothman calculated illy; as his calculation
was founded on an idea of the puÃllanimi
ty of the ! eople; that th;y are afraid of
war, and glad to have peace on any term?,
'or by whatever means. He did r.ot think
that this is the fentimenta of the American
people. They love peace, and would go
as far as any people to preserve it; but he
belitved when they have exhausted every
means of conciliation in vain; when these
conciliatory meafurea have produced noth
ing hut new aggression, and no profpeft of
an honourable adjustment of difference re
mains, in such ..circumftances, he believed
they would chufe war rather than peace, as
more for the interest of the country, and
its future lafling peace.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania had
himfelf agreed that it would be wrong for
any party to hold, correspondence with
Trance under our present circumstances; but
that gentleman draws a diftinftion between
a party .and an individual, which he did
not understand,. as he coald not conceive
why an individual was not equally juftified
with a party in holding such a correfpon
dejice.â-..1f it was usurpation, it matters
not whether it be by an individual or a
partyâboth are alike criminal. A party
might be more dangerous, but au individual
is equally criminal.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania has
made fcveral obje&ions to the motion, on
the ground of its interfering with individ
ccrnt. These had been fully answered by
the gentleman from Connecticut, by faying
that this refutation has no reference to auy
other ucgociations but those of peace or
war between a foreign nation and the United
States. He might that it is merely
an inftru&ion for a cornmjttee to report a
bill ; and if any fear exifled with r.cfpeft to
an interference with private buGnefs, when
the bill came in, this could be easily guar
ded againlt. He hoped, therefore, the
measure would be-agreed to.

Captain Edwards, of the (loop Happy re

day last, from Hondura?, with dispatches fcr
Lord Balcarres, came to this town oaThurl
day, and brought with him letters containing
accounts of an unfuccefsful attack made by
the Spaniards on our poffelfions there, which
our readers will find amply detailed below. j
Captain Edwards arrived at Honduras from

ever upon the coast, but upon their perceiving (
an augmentation of the BritiJh force, consist- '
ing of the Happy Return, a (hip, and two 1
other vefiels, together with the ncrth seasons !
having set in, which rendered it less practi
cable for them to gain their own ports, in 1
cttfe of defeat, should they risk another at- c
tack, they made off, and -were dogged by 1
fbme of our craft to their posts on theccaft. c
They afterward'; vifated Ker Chappcl, where '
the Spaniard? had render von fed and found it .
covered with graves, but wliether they con
tained the bodies of thole who fell ifi the at
tack, or of those who had fallen victims to

not be ascertained. Although fears are ex- 1
prefled by the inhabitants of another attack, '
we are a flu red by Captain Edwards, that at 1
this time of the year nothing is to be 1
feared from them. From the time of collec
ting the Spanifli troftps, and the putting in
execution their intentions, desertions had f
been general, and the people had openly ex- 1
jireffed thsiraveriion to the expulsion of the I
British from Honduras. f
Caprrn Edwards also mentions the gallant
conduct of Capt. Olmar un American, who
had loft his vessel on a reefâWhen the attack
was threatened, he solicited, and obtained I
the command of a flat, and in a creek he sus
tained at one time an action against five of

Extract of a letter from Baltimore, dated
2&tb December.
The capt. of an armed veffbl belonging to
this place arrivsd this day from Guadaloupe
via Martinico fays, he was exchanged and
relieved from prison by the captain cf a Bri
tish man of war ; thtt the fime privateer
that captured him, also captured the schoo
ner Retaliation belonging to the United
States, and carried her into Guadaloupe.
Another letter to the fame gentleman, da
ted Honduras, Ift Oftooer, mentians ar. at
tack made on that fettlemeut by the Spaniard*
on the fir.ft September, in which th y v/erc
beat off by the inhabitants and flavc-s only,
without the military, vfry fup.-rior
Ln numbers, kc.
The Retaliation, on the ad of this tnohth,
was off the Capes of Virginia, in company
with the Montezuma. It is therefore more
than improbable, (he could have proceeded to
the latitude of the Weft-Indies, and after
being- taken, the Baltimore veflel be also
taken, exchanged and released, proceed to
Martinico, and thence to Baltimore in the
short peribd of 26 days.
The " Germantown Federal ift," " Stei -
ner," " Penrtlylvanienlis," J.N. See. kc.â
are received.
j The Medical Pieces still remaining on
; hand, will be brought forward early ; after
i which the controversy will be excluded from

1 Salem December 21,
Yesterday's Chronicle tells a (lory about
the pusillanimity of the (hip Liberty, of 20
guos, belonging to Salem, commanded by a,
Capt. Freeman, and eruifing off St Jargo de
Cuba, in fllffiering nr. 18 grto JtrUi/ti ftÂ»tp
to prÂ«rs ftjiuc of her hands ; and even calls
on tbe President of the U. S. to have this
Capt. Freeman ca/hicred. The ohjeft of
this falfhood seems to be, to tell the world
that the armed veffcls of the U. S. are vo
luntarily furnifhed recruits to British (hips,
wh ch would be making some compe fati
on for the lighting our battles. But the
public may reft allured they are imposed up.
on by a mere fabrication, as there is no such
(hip, or captain, belonging to this port.

that the poetical powers displayed in it are of a
very luperior kindâConception more lofty and
daring;, sentiments more commanding, and lan
â¢ guage more energetic, will not easily be found
nor does scarcely Â»Ry part of it fink into languor,

whoU. The language is, for the mod part, mo
dellcd o.uhat of Milton ; and not unfrequently.it
has a ftronjr rcljfli of Shakefpearc."
