family, after having been concerned during the

prietor of one of the fined eftate6 in the neigh

ecus of 1790. â[t were to be wished that Real
! fpecified the ftrms. Several millions can scarce
less than 2,400,000, which reckoning the petit
of France at 8 to a pound sterling, will give us
enormous result of Â£. 300,000.

The king had not appointed the commiSioner

Insurance at Lloyd's, when ths Minerva failed,
was done at 3 guineas on American (hips arfd pro
perty ; but had been done at 4, j, 6, 7, and 8
guineas, in eonfequence of the capture of the
Mount Vernon. Many of jhe richel and rnoft
cautious writers, would not write on American
(hips or property for several days.
Money was extremely scarce in England, and the
trade mueh embarraflrd. Many of the principal
wanufa&urers had discharged the moil of their
bands, not being able lo pay them their weekly
wages, the consequence of the (hort remittance
from America, and the many proteftcd bills.
The losses sustained by the English, in the Me

it impotiible to traijfmit you an account of them
* before this time. j (
" A few days ago, the reinforcement t>f 20,C00 j
men, which the Aaftrian army of the Rhine had j
j sent to the-army of Italy, ari ived, which, united .
to the numerous recruits, and a very eonfiderable p
number of battalions from the interior of Auttria,
rendered this army extremely formidable. The ge
-1 neral opinion was, that the Aufltianswould feou be f
i in polTtffion of Milan. On the 11 in, at 3 o'cloek v
3 in the morning, general Mafiena's divifiao was at- -
3 tacked by very numerous forces, >nd compelled to
~i give up the important io(k of Corona. At the
. fame time, a detachmei â¢ of- 15,000 Auftrians fur
-1 prised general Soret's division at Salo, and obtain
) rd possession of that important pelt. Guieux, ge
f neralof brigade, with 600 men of the 15th demi-
1 bi-age of light infantry, shut ttemfelves Up in a j
l very large house at Salo, and thence braved the ef-
5 forts of the enemy, who furrouuded tbtir position.
I Rufca, geneial of brigade, was wounded.
3 "While a detachment of the enemy's HiviCos ( j
. blocked tip general Guieux at Salo, another pro
j ceeded to Brescia, surprised the French who wete *
S there, took four companies, whom I had (tation-
. ed there for the defence of the plact; 24 men be-
j Urging to the 25th regiment of cbaG'eurs, two ge* jj
1 nerals, and several officers Â®f diitinftion, who re
mained on account o{ ir.difpofition. General So
c ret's divilion, which was to have covered Brescia, V
r retreated to Defenzano. In this dilemma, and
preflVd by a formidable army elated by their recent
r success, I felt-the necessity of adopting some prompt
and vigourous expedient. The enemy, in their de
; scent from the Tyrokfe by way of Brescia iisd the j
Adige, placed mc in the ccntre of their force.â 1
; The republican army was too wea(t to make a Hand
e againtt the enemy's two grand divisions ;it might,
I however, engage them fepaiatelv, and this mode of
i conduct fcemed preferable, as my position was be
tween these divisions. It was therefore possible, by
e a rapid retrogade movement, to surround ihfdivi
-1 vilion Â«n its maich to Brescia, to take them pri- Â®
v foners, or detest them, and thence return with
f equal celcrity to the Mincio, at Wurmfer, and o
s blige him to retreat to the Tyrolefe ; but in order
to carry this projedt into effect, it v.ould be necef
- firy in 24 hours, to raise the siege of Mantua, Â£
f which was on the point of being taken, as the gaur- j.
risen did not pofleji the means us defence for fix
e hour? longer. "-For the completion of this enter- j
prise, it would be necessary to recrcl's the plains of
n Mincio, and prevent the enemy's divisions from fur- v "
r rounding me. Fortune has favouied the tnterprifr,
and the battle of Defenzano, the two battles of C
t Salo, the engagement at Lonado, and the brilliant !
vidlory at Calliglioue, are the effedfs of it.
"Untheizth, in the evening, all the divisions C
were on their march towaids Urefcia. The Auf
if trian divilion, which had taken poffrffion of that Â°
- place, was now at Lonado.
â¢' On the IJth, 1 ordered guneral Soret to re- '
pair to Salo, to relieve general Cuki.x, and general
Dailemange to attack arid retake Jionado at any c
price. Soret succeeded completely in extricating,
Guieux at Salo, after having beaten ta
ken two ftandatds, two picces of cannon, and about
two hundred prisoners. General Guitux, and the v

their march. The column arrived at Lomtdo, and
forced the eaemy's poiition. The 15th regiment

pieces of artillery. I ordered my aid-de-carop, Ja

if pofiible, Ltefenzano, and to oblige them by that
means to retreat towards Salo.
On his) arrival at DJfenrano, he there found Col.
Bender with r{y of his regiment, of Hulans,
v.hom he attacked. Janof, not widiinjj raeiely to
cfct off their rear, made a circuit with a part of his

lonel, arid was about to take him prisoner, when he
wjis himfelf surrounded. He killed fix men wit,h
his ownbatid, but was a! lingth overpowered, thrown
into a ditch, and received 6 wounds, of which
lam given to hope none is mortal. The eutnuy ef

During this time gen. Arigerauattacked C*ftiglione

They loft 20 pieces of cannon, from two to three

" I sent gen. Hilaire to Salo to aft in concert with
gen. Guicux, to attack the enemy's division at Ga

1 ders to march a part of hii troops towards Cobourg
â¢ and Lichtenfels, in order to obtain (he belt informa
â¢ lion refpe&ing- the column which the enemy had

" I was soon infoimed that these troops, after

' This movement was executed on the 6th, -when a
moll bloody engagement totik place between
cavalry of the enemy and that of ths division of
general Lefebvre. The enemy occupied a camp at
Ahendorf, and pushed their advanced potts trom
Strullendorf to a league and a. half beyond Bijre*

who should employ the greatest natnber of cava'.ry.
1 Under circumflandej the enemy anticipated'
the moll brilliant fucccfs.
" In the mean time, however, the cavalry of
general Lefebvre ai rived ; it was composed of three
'â  fquadrona of the fir It regiment, of three of the
ninth regiment of c l iffeurs, and of the eighth re
-1 giment of cuirsffiers; thfy had scarce taken brea:b

before an enemj- far iiipeiiot in numbers. Here
i they charged, and the enemy not being able to re
sist the firlt check, gave way and retreated in difor
; <ier, but soon profiting of their fapeiiotity, they
felkupon our left, and threatened our flank. Ge- '

foiae companies to meet them ; the conflict now
was most obtlinate, and the eonfufien extreme;
in the mean time each rallied at the voice of his

" We charged a second time,-aÂ»d the enemy
\vereahout to carry the village, when Captain Prud

vent our pursuit, fired without dillinction upon their
troops and ours, both from mtilquetry and from the
artillery which they had placed at the village of
AlteiidorlF to pioteÂ£t their retreat.
" General Lefebvre, having obtained his object,
put an end to the' action, and contented biniMf
with making t!i* troops of the division which had
begun to defile, take, under the fire ut his artillery
the ground which he had ordered them to occupy.
" Whilst this was pafllng on the a bodÂ£

ed, and the enemy look to flight, after having fut
fercd a considerable loss.
" Gen. Kray who commanded this division of
. eir Â® rm y> fixed all his attention on the attack and
direction of this column, because here the fire of
thp muflvetry and artillery was mod violent. But j
while he his manoeuvre, thecolun-.n J
oiider gen. Berdanotte advanced against Hochftet,
but without attacking it, that he may give time to
the division of cavalry under gen. Bofincau, (who
had received prders to pass the river, and to turn r
the left flank of the enemy) to begin their opera- r
tiwng. r J
S
" All this was executed with the greatest intel- \
ligence and precision, and the enemy's general, who J
c.J not expect this manoeuvre, immediately became
undecided in all his movements. Of this itidecifion A
the generals Bernadotte, Bonneau, and Championet *
knew how to profit, and he was forced, 'after re- v
peated charges of cavalry and infantry, to effect I,
hu retreat. He however proteded it by a heavy J,
fire u artillery, which was arfwered by ours with J<
its accuflomed efficacy, and succeeded to throw the J ;
Auftrians into thÂ« greatest disorder. G
U c van guard of the 3 divisions instantly pur- A
, and without giving them time to rally, 1
compelled them to pass the Rednitz, from which "lev
they withdrew the bridges. General Klein took on t
his position on the bank of this river.
I he enemy according to the report of 111 the
general officers, had the greater body of cavaliy
but ?)1 our corps combated with To much ' valour, T
the generals and commanders of divisions direded into
and executed their manoeuvres with so much wif- culo
rom, 1 hat all obftaeles were overcome, and nothing- wcei
couid refill them. fcng l
" THe enemy's loss was very grest both in in- T'
tantvy and cavalry, and we took a hundred pruW
