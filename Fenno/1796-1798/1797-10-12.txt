For the Gazette of the United States.
Philadelphia, OSober sth, 1797.
Mr. B. WYNKOOP.
(Conthided from ytfierdafs Gazette.
But without having recourse to conelu
fions drawn from the nature and phenomena
of the difcnfe, from former observations,
and the uniform experience of ages, several
circumstances occurred, previous to and at
the time that the disease firll made its ap
pearance in Philadelphia, which convince
mÂ» that it derived its origin from foreign
contagion, and not from the effluvia of da
maged coffee.
A malignant and contagious fever had
been introduced info Grenada, and from
thence communicated to several other Weft
India islands, as has already been related,
previous to its appearance in Philadelphia.
Between these and Philadelphia there had
been frequent intercourse.
At the very time that the Amelia was
discharging her cargo, the fans-culottes
privateer from Nantes arrived with a prize
(hip called the Flora of Glasgow. The
privateer had touched at Martinique, ac
cording to the report of Dr. Keaton, ftir
geon of the Citizen Genet, and took in se
veral fre(h hands. Upon her arrival at
Philadelphia, her prize, on the 28th of
July, came along fide of the Amelia, and
the ereyr, which upon landing received their
prize-money, dispersed themfejves into dif
ferent lodging houses, among their country
men who had taken refuge in Philadelphia.
Two took lodgings at Richard Dennie's
nearly, opposite the wharf. The firft cafe
that occurred was in Dennie's house. From
this single spark, which made its appear
ance on the 2d or 3d of Augurt, a blaze
was kindled, which in the course of three
months destroyed 4048 lives yrithin the
city and suburbs ; besides a number in the
country who received the infection in the
city ; particulars of' which have been de
tailed by Mr. M. Carey in a pamphlet.
This lodging house lay in a direftion un
favorable for any effluvia to be conveyed to
it by the wind which prevailed at that time,
as maybe fcen'in my review of Dr. Ru(h's
opinion published in 1794.
That the disease was imported into New
Haven in 1794 ; into New York in 179J ;
and into this city the present year, I have
already (hevrn in my firft and second letters
to you. I (hall now close the fubjeft of
our iiiicullion with observing, that those
physicians who aicribe the origin of that
fever, which has occasioned such deplora
ble mortality in several of our commercial
cities, as wclf as in the Weft Indies, fijÂ»ce
the year 1793, to the exhalation of putrid
vegetable fuhftatices, betray the most un
pardonable remiflnefs in their researches in
to the nature and h'ftory of disease?, or
wilfully (hut their eyes against evidence that
woul<J neceflarily enforce Conviction in every
mind not adluatcd by some malignant mo
rive. Nctwit'nftanding oilr difference in
sentiment, I remain, with fiucere wishes
for your health and welfare,
Your most obedient servant,
WM. CURRIE.
For tie Gazette of the United sTales.
MR. BENJAMIN WYNKOOP.
0 Sober 10th, 1797.
SIR,
IN the lafl letter I addrefTed to you, I
omitted mentioning the account given by
Dr. Schotte, of the origin of a contagious
yelloiu fever at Senegal iu the year 1778.
" On the 4th of Aiiguffi (fays Dr.
Schotte) in the year IjfH, a contagious
fever, diftinguilhed by yellowness of the
j furface of the body and black voraitting,
; made its appearance in a hospital at Senegal
j in Africa, at a time when the rains were hea
| vy and the iflartd was overflowed with water,
â¢ the contagion of which was brought from
! Goree, a garrison belonging to the French,
iby some black mefTengers. The contagion
of this fever was so a&ive, and the disease
j so mortal, that of- 92 white people who
| were on theifland, only 33 were alive when
! the French invefled'h in Jafluary 1779, and
!8 of these were hardly able to walk. Two
' of them were afterwards drowned in crossing
the bar of Senegalâand three died on their
pafTage to France."âln this fever the eyes
were red and shining at the beginningâbut
became yellowjn the courfs of the disease
when it proved mortal &c.
If the fails and arguments which have
been offered in the course of our oorrefpon
dence, are not fufficient to convince every
impartial enquirer that the malignant fever,
which has occasioned such deplorable mor
tality in different places since the year 1793,
did not originate from the effluvia of vegeta
hlepuirefaftion ; but from'febrile contagi
on, geÂ»erattd originally in,the confined and
impure air of ships,- and imported from the
Weft-Indies, additional arguments, in
proof of this, mas be drawn from the disease
having .tilways made its firft appearance in
the seaport towns, and in families that re
side or tranfail business near to the wharfs
frequented by seamen ; from its having been
confised, for fotne time, to the neighborhood
where it firft appeared ; from its having been
afterwards propagated by contagion, and no
other way, as evident from all those escaping
who secluded themselves from all intercourse
with the deceased ; as was repiarkably the
cafe with 200 prisoners confined in the jail
' n ! 793Â» the pensioners in the alas house,
and thd patients in the hospital: and from
its not ceafinjg to spread, after heavy rains,
while the atmosphere continues warm, which
is invariably the cafe with bilious fevers oc
casioned by putrid vegetable effluvia.
Physicians, as well as philosophers, are
too apt to ascribe any extraordinary effedl to
a coincidence or accidental occurrence of
circumstances totally independent and un
connected with each other, instead of tracing
it to its genuine and neceflary fourcc. Thus
in 1793, btcÃufc a quantity of damaged
coffee happened to lay in a dock near the
neighborhood where the disease firft appear
ed, it was ascribed to that circumstance,
though from the nature of the disease, it
could noP possibly have had any more con
nexion with it, than a quantity of millstones
that lay in the fame neighborhood. To fa
vor this opinion, the season was called a
tropical one, though dry and in every other
refpedl one of the most healthy that we had
had for several years. In 1795, when the
season was cool and wet, some of the very
learned physicians of New-York ascribed it
to the mud of the docks, and, in the face
of glaring fadls, denied that it was contagi
ous, though it was proved by unqueftiotiable
fails that it was introduced from Port-au-
Prince by the brig Zephyr.*âAnd the pre
sent season, because the streets and wharfs
were remarkably clean at the time the disease
appeared iu this city, and the atmosphere
has been frequently refrefhed with heavy
rains, which cleared the air of all impurities
and rendered it temperate and wholesome,
and no other coincidenee could be difcowr
ed, it is ascribed to the bilge water of a sin
gle merchant-ship.
To conclude, if our climate has become
so unwholesome and impure as to convert
the effluvia of a few putrid vegetable into a
peflileatial and contagious nature, we ought
to desert our devoted cities, and fcek an
asylum in a climate where we might be se
cure from such a deplorable calamity ; for
in this we never could be fafe, so long as a
vegetable is fuffered to rot in our flreets, or
a veflel with bilge water is permitted to en
ter our ports. But as there art no fadls
but imaginary ones in support of a doÂ£lrine
so injurious to the reputation of our climate,
and consequently to the interest of our com
merce, I hope you will no longer perfifl in
your endeavors to give currency, to so pal
pable as well as injurious an error.
I am, with all due refpedl,
Your obedient servant,
WILLIAM CURRIE. <
* See-letter-fHJin.the NeivOforlc board of health,
publifhcd in Mr. Brown's paper of the 24th of Sep
ter, 179?.
The following Anecdote is- translated from
the French Paper, called Europe Poli
tique :
" An emigrant came to get hi 3 name era
sed from the fatal fift. After paying the
brokers he had but a small sum remaining.
He resigns himfelf to the misfortune, and
purchases in the neighbourhood of his form
er estate a cottage and a garden, which he
cultivates; he has the pleasure, at least, of
breathing his native air, and of walking
der those bowers which had been the theatre
of the sports of his infant years. The pof
ftfTor of his estate was not> at ghome. One
day he received a letter from him, and in
viteshim to do him tjje honor of dining with
him. The firft emotion which ke felt, was
that of indignation ; curiosity succeeded.
The emigrant communicated his embarrafl"-
| merit to one of his neighbours, who encon
j rages him, from the account li e give's of the
j possessor, to meet him on the day appointed.
He resolves to do it, and upon his arrival
is received with politeness ; he maiWfefts his
aftonifliment, wishes to enter into in expla
nation, and receives for answer, " Sir, I ne
ver speak of business before dinnerâit is u
pom the table ; your place.'' The
emigrant lifted his fcrvice and found three
keys under it. "It is your place Sir," said
he to the pofTefTor ; " the keys are a proof
of it." 'Â« No these keys are for you ; after
. dinner I shall explain the enigma."
I " The time of dinner" appeared th 'be te
; dious to the emigrant ; at lafl they pafl'ed
: into an apartment joining the dining room,
: when the poJTeflbr fays to the*emigrant, ope
, of these keys is that_of your fecrelaire.â
| You will find in it all that you left ; your
I money, jewels and papers. Nothing ha's
been touched. Another is that of yoty
chest, where youv plate and linen are equal
ly Entire. The third is that of your cellar;
then? has been nothing taken out of it but
the wine which we have just been drinking ;
they all belong to you as welf as the estate
of which I have taken poffcflioiV, an'd here
jis the aft of retrocession." " But, Sir, I
must be as delicate as yota,and reimburse you
what you have paid for it." " No, I _have
enjoyed for three years the revenue of your
property, and if we were to calculate exaft
j lv, the balance would be found to be on my
' fide." We leave the reader to make his own
j reflexions up6n this circumstance. The
faÂ£l happened in Normandy.
From the Farmer's Weekly Museum.
HE is a Genius.
Almost every parent will fay of his son,
j"He is a genius." -Why ? Because, from
a very natural- and innocent prejudice, he
believes he is an extraordinary boy. If ge
nius met with fufficient encouragement, and
your son happened to be one of these rare
birds, it might be well to afiiil him him in
his flights. It he is not, never lead him
into a fatal crrror. I seldom spend an even
ing at my neighbour Meanwells', but he
employs one half his time in praising the
uncommon talents of darling Sammy. He
is called upon to speak a number of decla
mations, he has learned at school : his'ora
tory hasjuft as much merit as his parrot's.
His writing and ciphering books are shown,-
as prodigies of improvement ; they prove
that he has had an attentive matter, and is a
very careless. scholar. The foud father be
lieves him to be a natural poet : true he is
fond of reading ballads, has taught to
repeat a number of hymns by heart, and
like most children, is fond of the tinkling'
of rhyme. He has proceeded so far as to
compose a few couplets, that w6u]d be a
fufficient antidote to the poetic mania.â
His little tricks are related as the marks of
sagacity, or flights of genius. lam tired
of hearings them. He is is neither more nor
less than other boys, and his father is like
many other men. 'Tis a pity a lad (hould
be made a fool because he happens to be
thought a genius. How often is a lad sent
to college, because he is unfortunately mis
taken for as uncommon youth ?âA father,
who has not spare dollars enough to bring
up his son at college, would do well never
to force him from the beaten tradl of " hon
ed industry it ha| peace and plenty on
the right hand and on the left. A good
common education' the habit of indus
try are worth more to a-young man, than
the dear bought and ill merited A. M.
Many miy flutter on the artificial wings of
genius; but few can soar above their'fel
loiy creatures. A real genius is a very rare
thing ; not to be Â£een in every family, ex
cept by the eye of dotage or ignorance. If
a boy, from the produftion of his leisure
hours, that his mate# devote to play, can
produce a masterly specimen of mechanical
genius, encourage his exertions, and let him
follow the bent of his mind. If he discover
an early propensity to study, will be induf
trions in the field,.and forfeit the pad times
of youth, for the entertainment of his books,
becomes master of his Pike, and a proficfent
in philosophy and history, let him drink hi' 3

but his flights of fancy, love of poetry, nov

Fancy without judgment is a fine (hip with
out a rudder ; it had better he at anchor in
a fafe harbour, than be let adrift on the

AddrefTed to Citoyen LanuffeatÃourdeaux,
July XI, 1 797-
" The enemy has not incommoded us, since
our lafl of the 7th. Yesterday in the morn
ing, a vefTel, 3 bilindero, und 3 obvtfiers (j
veflels in all) âapproached with an intenti
on to batter the place, but the valour of
our firmed vessels was such as not to foffer
their approach, and the enemy retired with
out doing any mifchief.
" You cannot my friend, how
much we have laboured here this week and
the last. The forces of the light squadron,
such as chaloupes, connoulers, and lbnthons
have been increased to four times their form
-1 er number. The merchants have given four
millions of reaux,. for the urgent expences
of the prefent*moment, and gratuities to
the marines. The crevu of the chalope which
chafed a bombarder have received JO thousand
dollars for their braveryâand that 'which cha
fed a chalope of the enemy and tool it, have re
ceivedfix thousand dollars. The contempt
they hold the Englifli in, has given so much
valour to our marines, that they labor like
lions. Yesterday it was wished to change,
or renew the i'eamen of the whole light fqua
dron, but they all cfeofc to rcrn-ifit 3 d,.\s
longer, nor finding themselves fct'>ued.
" The city has also armed fomt' tartans,
for hot balls ; all is under the direction of
admiral Mazaredo.
" The Engl iff] squadron is verydifcantent
edâit is in a (late of infurrgftion. The fea
meu are not willing tocome in their chalopes
to attack this placeâbecause of the multi
tudes which they have already loft besides
there is not much profpeft of pillage.
" Commerce is absolutely in Jlagnation the
greater part of the inhabitants have quit the city
Every thing is overturned."
[ The blundering manner in â¢which the above is
arranged leaves us rather in the darh, 'whe
ther the daU, July 21, is for Cadiz .or
Bourdeaux, if the former, it is the Ittcjl ne-ws
from the. Icleagured city ; and direffly con
tradicts the recently received intelligence, that
Admiral Jervis had left it, July 17, and
was pursued by Ad. Majferado. If this
Chronicle article is correS the Spanish Admi
ral is rather more generous than jifl. 50,000
dollars for chafing a vej[el,and only 6000 for
capturing one !It certainly arofefrom favor
itifm y and, if true, ought to create discon
tents andmurmul-s. The concludingparagraph
exhibits Cadiz, as truly diftrejfed though the
English are held in contempt, j
[ Mercury.
We are informed of an arriv 1 at trie east
ward from Gibraltar, which failed Aug-uil
1 ; and that the Englifn fleet still remained
before Cadiz, at that date.

âRole d'Equipage ! ! ! âJ
Messrs. M'Lean & Lang,
When attempts are daily making, and e-
W very opportunity .eagerly embraced for in
fluejicing and jnving a wrong and dangerous
b'.as to the public mind, on a fubjedt highly
inlcrelting to our country in a national as
well as individual point of view, it behoves
every man not altogether immersed in the
M consideration of his private affars, to devote '
tome moments to what regard* the honor '
of hrs country. On no occasions are patri
otic exertions more loudly called for than
Jwhen the general good is likely to be injur- ,
ed by the secret and imperceptible machi- ,
I nations of a combination of wealthy individ
ualsâActuated by these sentiments, and, ; J
, not engaged diredjjy nor indiredtly, *i navi- ]
f gation, either as insurer or insured, I deter- t
mined to hazard a few observations on the ]
injultice and political danger of holding up l
an idea of the Underwriters .NOT being li- t
able, where vessels were unprovided with a c
I Role d'Equipage. lam very confident eve- r
L ry engine is ei .ployed by certain grasping 0
L and defigm'ng underwriters in this city, re- t
gardlefs of the political consequences, to e
give a falfe impression to the public opiu- 0
ion, as to their liability under certain circum- ti
Itances for American property' insured by j \{
them. When I saw a HiNrinth- 'Com- r
mercial Advertiser' of Saturday lalt to the ! d
insurers to avail themselves of Lord Ken- I d
yon's decision in the cafe of an American ! vv
vessel condemned by him for not having a 01
Role d'Equipage, I must confefs my fur- , p
} prift was not equal to my indignation ; and J b<
t the immediate recolkdtion of the letter a- i {" G
j * bom the Role d'Equipage published in the j a
Minerva a few days ago with such studied ' (h
assiduity, as coming from Nantz to a "res ' a â
j pedtable house in this city," &c. confirmed l ev
me at once in the well grounded opinion I , f Q
had conceived, of the designs and exertions cr ,
of some interested men, to give an improper tif
bia; to the public mind'on this momentous tic
national fubjedt. j , r ;
. I beg to be permitted to put a few quef- W
tiortsto Mr. Webster, who seems not to be tre
v feufible of the dangerous political tendency, I 0 f
particularly at this time, of giving an opin- f er
. ion publicly in favor of the underwriters. JÂ£ v
f Did not public opinion and the laws con
sider an American vessel as fully and com- an(
pletely documented without thij newly dif- a b]
covered pretext called a Role d'Equipage ? thi
. Did not the insurer and insured perfectly
f undefftand each other at the time the ion- jââ
tradtof insurance was made, as to the ri/k to '
run and the premium said rilk was worth ? to
Have not the premiums on almost every oc- f ori
enfion been equal to what t hey would have jftj
been, were we at open war with France ? ry c
. Were not a gfeat many risk/i undetermined Th
V and vedels underwritten before the gre.y: bun
difco*ery made by the diredtory of the necef- exp
fity of a Jlole d'Equipage ? Was the want aco
of the Role d'Equipage thought of at the s on
time the firft arret of the diredtory was issued diff(
lagainft American vessels, and was such an ; mp
instrument mentioned among the reasons of- nat ;
fered when said decree was cnadted ? Was hav,
not the British treaty the only cause affigri- p U }j
ed whtn the arret firft came out ? Did not con |
thediredtory maintain that ground till driven forti
off by the powerfnl arguments of the legif- rew:
lative body of France ? Has not the diredt- c lâd
1 orv lately taken refuge in that miferaÃle, tore
llimfyhole calltd a Role d'Equipage, which m ; rr ,
m rauft soon be rendered untenable by the lu- qâ,'p
minous arguments of Segur, Paftoret, and ro ] e
, other honest and enlightened men in France ? jj-i
What good end was intended to be produc- the J
ed by this new-fangled pretext ? Did it ever no t ,
enter into the imagination of man til Hat- 01lct .
ly, tÂ® suppose that a simple lift of the names long
s of the crew of a vessel would eftablifli the evi-! was ,
I dence of its being neutral property ?Is it not ; ry c
â¢ revolting to common fenfie and common hon- Wha
eft-y, to hear the fame lips to day jnftifying f f wer
French depredations, which, yesterday, were ca p t:
*>â  ciying out in every quarter of the city, t he <
V French robbers, villains, pirates," and a p a (Tp
long train of opprobrious epithets ? Would at t h (
not decisions in rtur courts of justice against q U j re
the insured eftabli(h the justice of what, by crc d
all but Jacobinic Americans and Frenchmen, e flf
has till lately been declared piracy ? Would etiligl
k not a single decision by any one of our ]yi a r(l
J â  courts of justice in favor of the underwrit- Segui
trs, eftablifli a principle that would gladly f oun d
be grasped at by the French nation, and p rant
forever preclude any of our injured and al- heade
mod ruined from tho possibility of ar ,tly
ever recovering a single (hilling from France ? conc [ (
With what face could we demand reditu- nl j |
tion for the immense property we have been p U l ou
robbed of, if the robber brings forward our ons ,
own authority to juftify his condudt? teradt!
Ought our government to lay under the im- t i C e fc
putation of ignorance and raftincfs in fend- a ti on
ing forward envoys extraordinary to redress men v
wrongs', which we have never sustained, by right
affording the people who have injured us frivol'
the opinions and decisions of our own citi- driven
zens and tribunals to jultify their criminal t h> iui
condudt ? Have not all the translations of g C5> t
our treaty with France erf 1778, rendered the ab
the words " Role d'Equipage"âa lift of , an y e ,
the crew ? Have not our vessels; at the re- s in g f r
f quest and order of our Executive, been fur- an( j ro
nifhed with a lift of the crew during the cc
whole of the present war in Europe ? Did
not the "diredtory formally annul the treaty ,
of 1778, 011 account ot our late treaty with
Great Britain, previous to its decree refpedt
ing the Role d'Equipage ? What right then O" ru<
had the diredtory, after the eiiadtion of such
a decree, annulling the treaty of 1778, to
issue this arret refpedting the Role d'Equi
page ?Is it not better, both in an humane cam.
us well as.commercial point of view, where apply ic
the scales of justice are equally poised, al
ways to incline in favor of the insured?
How much more imperiously do the present j"
circumstances, where justice is evidently OA
and glaringly on the fide of the insured,
demand a decision against the underwriters ?
In (hort, did not the insurer warrant and willfrt
defend the property of the insured against for fom
piracy, aud do not the French themlelvts Sept,
*
f u " directory pirates ? Let every lioneft,
impartial, humane arid patriotic mind seri

A foreigner observed, one day in the be
gining of August last, that the citizens of
Philadelphia were the most afitive, industri
ous, and sagacious in acquiring wealth, 'of
any j people he had ever known, and he had p u b
travelledâbut, added he, they are strangely
improvident in grudging such a proportion,
of their riches as would give a permanent
value to their pofleffions ; and in the end. A 1
prove them to be true economists. The ci- g
ty, said he, js now threatened with a second f 0
rifitation of t>i fever which proved such a <â 
fcourgein 1793. The real lot's of property to tl
sustained that year, amounted probably to a enc
sum much more than fufficient to defray the E nv <
expense of draining off all the Ihgnated wa- 0 f t h
ters in the neighborhood, and introducing, hono
ft reams from distant fountains that ftiould j o ,irr
perpetually flow thro', and wash all the âi ent
streets and sewers of the city. Situations
in Europe had, by these meaij.s, been ren
dered healthy, fvhich before had proved Â®
grave-yards to all who attempted to rdide
in them.
These remarks might be enforced by a xx '"
thousand considerations which result from a m ;(v.
contemplation of the aftual state of things in V pjfe!
this city and neighborhood. I am one of (near
those who believe that the malignant difor- loft,
ders under which we have fuffered, were im- Ar
portedâbut, at the fame time, suppose vtns>
local causes have favored their diflemination. ,
Those causes may be removed or ameliorated from
âand until something more to tha
the oecafioa is done, we (hall continue to Bay.

I?VER since this difcafe made such ravages in this
city and New-York, the author hay turned his
attention to its cause* and cureâThe rdult of his
enquiries convinced him that the reason why so
few persons recover from its attacks, are frÂ«m its
not being well under flood, and the confcquent
\ method taken to cure it. He is peffuaded
; that theexceflive bleedigns and mercurial reatmeiat
j of the Faculty iÂ« highly injurious, and that the on
j ly rational mode of treatment is by the use of proper
1 acids. Convinced of this he offers his Specif ccs a
certain remedy, if used according to the dircÂ«stions.
