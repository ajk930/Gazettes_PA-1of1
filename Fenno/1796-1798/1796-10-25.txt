but that Mr. Adams had laid it down as a rule, to
vote with the reprefentativet, in cafet of equal divi.
(ion in the senate, unlefi his judgment vat very
clearly and (tiongly convinced that he ought to vote
l P differently.
1 could produce some other inftanees of his ha
ving pursued that line, but #ne pointed cafe was fuf
ficient to convict Hampden of a falfe aflirtion
This specimen of his liberality and candor will give
a jult idea of the credit to be given to the rell of
his aflertiofM, The refutation of this, and the pre.
ceding charges. Jo pofitiveiy made, will also pm the
good citizens of this country en their guard againlt
similar charges produced by Mr. Jefferfon'* parti,
j, zans, againlt Mr. Adams.
Where did Hampden find the faÂ£t > if in the
journal* of the senate, let him produce the cases,
for they tie all dated in the journals ; if those be
resorted to, I am convinced as many instances can
be found Where Mr. Adams voted on the one fide
j as ou the other. Hearsay and mere report are not
fuffisient grounds of condemnation before the en
lightened tribunal of the public J the mere alTerti
ons of Hampden will certainly not be credited after
this- detection. It seems to be the peculiar charao
teriftic of those, who itile themMvet in thit Coun.
ty, the excltfivepatrittt, the true democrttf, ta build
up their own reputation-oa the ruin of their adver
saries, and to support their fyllem *Â«d importance
by inceflant del ration and the word barefaced falfe
hoods. But however they may have hitherto sup
ported a momentary confluence with a few unin
formed citizens, the fight of truth will ere long dif
t pel the baneful naifti of calumny, with which they
have enveloped the bed mm among ut, and rtsakc
e these defining hypocrite*fculk. back into their na
ttve obscurity.
If Mr. Adams fiat sometimes voted differently
from the reprefenwives, it is to be fairly presumed
that his judgment so directed him, nor oan it be
presumed that in such cafst he was clearly on the
wrong fide ; when so enlightened a body as the se
nate are equally divided, the question will be allow,
ed to be a nice one, and altho' it may have been
carried in the representatives, yet the majority there
may have been small, which indeed we k*ow to hare
t been aftnlly the cafe in very important qneftions.
It by no meant follows, as Hampden suppose*,
, " that the opinion of the reprefentstives must be I
always the opinion of the people." If so, all the i
senates, all the qualified negatives of the executives
t ought to be abolished : the afTettion it a libel on all
the American constitutions, and a severe censure on
Mr. JÂ«fferÂ£Â»n's do&rine, for he calls the rliere will of
tbfc representatives (unchecked by the senate) an
eleaive tyranny, the very definition of despotism. If
Mr. Adams ought, againlt his decided j'udgment, to
vote with the itprefcntative* on every equal division
of the senate, that body would be a fuperfluou*
member of the constitution, and the conllitutien,
now Co much admired, converted to aÂ« elective des
potism. ,
The ttniverfal eftabfifiiment of senates in the U
nited States, proves however, that our citiwns think
differently from Hampden on this fubje&, and their
frequent approbation of the eonduft of the senates
and executives, in refilling the will of the reprefen
tatrves (frequently ihÂ« momentary will of a wicked
fa ft ion,) proves chat they do aot alwaya-cenfider
their will as the opinion of the people. No aft of
the President's whole life has been more grateful to
the people of America, or has added taore to the <
retire of his fame, than his resisting the will of the i
representatives on the late call for papers ; which I
call is no# viewed throughout the union in its true i
light, as a meafute 4f party, merely deCgned to an- 1
fwer certain party views. t
Thus we find Hampden's reasoning as falfe at hit 1
fact : he firlt affumet- a fact, inr oiiliftem with Â«
truth, and then argues on it on principles, totally I
mconiiftent with the principles of the conltitution t
and of public feedem, and in direst opposition to h
the very principles of hit friend and patron.
Airong the other meritaof Mr, Jefferfon, at sta
ted by Hampden, we find Â«* bis attachment tr> the I '
civil and religious rights of his fellow-citizens:" *
for the proof, we are referred to his writings and ! I
Â»OBLtC CONDUCT. h

// The jd ad and 3d inft. were remarkable days nen
/for this city. On the id ind. half after two P. M- acc
ihe alarm was given, that the Imperialids were at cen
jthe gates, and almod in the fame instant a detach- hot
anient of Au(lrian light-horse earoe along the-ftreet whi

French, by no meant prepared for such a visit, hur. the

those who fell into the hands of the Imperialists, tffei
were cut to pieces. The Imperialids galloped e- i
very wherethrough the city, and nothing could eflei
wtthdand their bravery. Tow aids evening more Lef
troopi rode into the city, and others encamped covi
round the fame. The enemy now commenced a med
dreadful cannonade from the fort which laded from the
5 o'clock in the afternoon of the jtt, until three f
o'clock in the afternoon of thethiid without any Gbt
intermiffioM ; the terrors of the inhabitants were ihe
to much the greater as they fired into the city, and ed t
some people were killed and others wounded.â at C
Twenty (hot fell on the city hall only. The garri- C
fan of the fort absolutely refufed to surrender, tho' fron
furrour.ded in some parts already, and tho' the heavy he v
artillery, fortunately for us, had been removed fame malt
days before. lutic
On the 2d towards noon General Grenier arri- wait

the army was assembled in the plain betwixt For- ofi

upwards of twenty battalions and fifty re;
um'er the command of lieutenant-general Brzary;
had reached Eberacb ; and threatened at once, b) cai

Wurtzburgh.
Early on the 31ft the archduke entered Bsir

the enemy, determined tÂ® pu(h on with the who), pr,
army towards Wurtzburgh ; a. being the point on Pr
the occupation ef which depended the pcffibility pr<
of forcing Jourdan to abandon the Meyn, and take an,
his retreat through the-country of Fulda, on the qu
Lahn. His royal highness proceeded in the even wit

at Lltmann, and general Stzary advanced to Klo
1. Iter Schwartzach.
On the id ot September the jsrehduke marched p"i
to Ober Schwarjzach, general Kray to Gerolddtof

pafled the Meyn : his atlvanced guard under gene
ra! Hotze, took poffeflion of the town of Wurtz

In the mean time the enemy drained every nerve

This jhfliclous manÂ«*uvre had the desired effect. Â£
Jourdan feeing himfelf rrenaced in the mo.l efiVn

the day. Jourdan made no attempt to recover the j
