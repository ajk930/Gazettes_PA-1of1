EVENING, SEPTEMBER 3.
To the Inhabitants of the town of Cincin
nati and its vicinity, in the Northwestern
Territoiy.
g ; n rlemen;
I HAVE received and read with much
pleasure your unanimous address of the zsjth
nf June. I agree with you, that in the or
dinary course of affairs, interpositions rtf po
pular meetings to overawe those to whom
the management of public affair* are con
fided, will seldom be warranted by discre
tion, or found compatible with the Â£ood or
der of society. Bnt at a period like this,
tliere 13 no method more infallible t(J detcr
n??ne the qtteilion, whether the people are
or are not united. Upon no ocfafion in the
history of America; has this mode of dis
covering and afcercairiing the public opinion
been so universally resorted to. And it
m3y be asserted with confidence, that at no
period of the exiiienceof the United States,
have evidences of the unanimity of the peo
ple been given, so decided, as on the present
question with France.
Tne people of this* country, the mod re
mote from the feat of government and .-entre
of information, as well as thof- in its neigh
bourhnod, have at length diffjivered that
they ar* American-, and feelingly alive to
the injuries committed again ll their coufi
try, and to the <ndig iitifÂ« offered to their
gov.'rnme:it.
Upon ourfe'ves or'ytve ought to depend
for fafety ?nd t'f fence. This maxim, how
ever, bV no n .ar.3 forbids us to avail our
selves of the advantages of prudent and will
' | warded concerts with others, exposed to
common dangers. Animated with fenti
roents like yours, our country is able to de
fend itfelf against any enemies that may rife
up against it.
Nothing can be mrre flattering to me
than your affu ance of confidence in this
perilous hour : and nothing could mortify
me so much, as that you should ever have
reason to believe that your confidence has
been misplaced. In return for your prayers
for my perf. nal happiness, I sincerely of
fer mine for the profperily of the North
â¢weftern Territory in common with all the
United States,

Mtflrs. Hudson and Goodwin, ,
Since I came into this ftaie from Philadelphia, 1
find there has been circulated hefe, a publication,
put porting to be a debate in the Srr.a'e of the United
States, 011 a motion ol Mr. Martin of North-Carolina,
ropolipone. to the next session of Congressâthe con.
(â delation of a bill, to declare void the treaties be.
twecn the United Sates and France. The part af_
Ggned to me in that publication, is so very differen,
from the oue I sQually took in the debate; that j
request you 10 P" bl (h the following sketch,
| n j, thefubftance of the observations I made, on thi,
Â® otlon- URIAH TRACY.
litchfiJd, Artg. 18, Â«79 8
Mr. P.efiden',
I hope this motion for postponement will no I ob
tVrif). âTwo reasons have been ur ? ;cd, in favor of the
Motion; one, the danger which wiH rcfalt from pal
fcp.g the bill now x 10 our citizens and their property ;
and the ether, goes so far, as to controvert ihÂ« prin
ciples of the Kill itfelf
Were this the fkft measure of disagreement between
us and France, the cafe might beditfeitnt: but we
have authorized the capture of French and
have palled many other aits, tending in their opera
tion to defend our citizens against French aggreflion ;
many, if not all Americans within the territory of
I ranee, z r c notified of thefea&s, at any ra e all Ame
ricans at home, who have property in the republic ol
France know of tbem ; and those at home and abroad,
have long known there were diffeiences ketwern the
two nations. âAnd those differences were specially
adapted to create caution, in trusting themselves or
property in France; and to excite aftivity in with
dtawing both, that may have antecedently been pla
ced there. When will there be a time, we can take
such a measure as this, withoutexpofing the pioperty,
and pofi-ibly the persons of lome individuals ?
it docs not appear that more injury will be incurred
by the paflage ol this bill the present, than at a future
frflion. Hut, are there not fame advantages to be
derived from enaÂ£l ng this bill into a law, the present
feflion ? The aft authorizing the capture ot French
armed vessels on our coast, does not provide a remedy
comnienfurate with the evil; it may be, and certainly
i.s doubted, whet Ik r by virtufe ol this aft, French
prisoners, (VÂ»uld any be taken, can be deprived of
t'hft benefrs of the treaties between the United States
and France; and whether if one of the French vef
jejs Ihoajd come into port, that the militia, or any
detachment ol our array arc authorized to make prize
ol her, These doubts can be done awav, by a diSo
lution of the treaties. But if this dissolution does
xu-t take place,'or a fpecific aft lor the purpose, we
(hall be left in an unpteÂ«r(Vt and awkward situation.
As the principle ol this bill is attacked, it is pre
sumed, a Ibort but comprehcnfive view ol the fabjeft
inav be proper, under the motion lor poflponement.
No principle bbetter ettabliihed by the laws of
nations, than, in safe of exiftiftg treaties, if one par
ty violates any one or more of the Imputation's, the
jnjurpd party has a right in consequence of such vio*
latton, to consider the whole void. she French go
vernment has most flagrantly violated federal of the
stipulations contained iri the treaties pi opofed to be
<Teciared void by this hill; this is a given faft by everv
member of the Senate. The right has then cieariy
accrued tv> the IMjed the policy c-t the mea
imc is by such. a variety ot important confi
tlera-tiens, that I cannot loi a moment htfuate to give
;hc bÂ»ll my moll hearty and unequivocal support*
Were it a given pointy that our envoys are to make

f Gent'emen Nave said, a declaration ot war is pre
ferable to this bill ; I acknowledge a'declaration of
war, will operate in effeft to rept3l the treaties, and
â  it is poflible if rhe gentlcfnen wlfh it, th v rnav be
j gratified by a declaration, duiing the present feffioM,
it in thecourieof next week, but of this i
cmnot decide, as I know not what will be done on
1 the fubjeft* or wbatcaufes may arise to induce such a
but am confident a repeal of the treaties is
> left violent, and will oc attended with less irouble
fome confequer.ccs than a of war. The
' one is diflolving a rendeied pernicious,
by the charafter ar-d violation of one of the parties;
the other is an exertion of our fSivuhies in open artack.
Treaties, by tne conflitution of the United Stages,
are theftapreme aw of the land, and our courts tnuft
govern tneir dec!lions by them, unlets otherwiie di
refted by for,re pofuive law. Several ?fts posTed this
fc'Hion, have, by opposing some pans of the treaties
between us and France, releafe<l our courts from the
obligations of those fpecific parts; but unl"fs we go
1 into minute details, and make laws to meet each cafe,
we must pafsthis general law, which will at once re-
Icafe courts and other citizens of the United States
from all obligations contained in those treaties, so far
as they have been considered the law of the land. This
in my opinion iÂ» more proper Than to multiply le
. gifhtive regulations.
It has been obfe>ved, that custom in other countries,
â  has not fanftioned the repeal of treaties To this it
mav be arnfwete4, that the power of making treaties,
Â» and declaring war are ordinarily lodged in the fame
person or body of men, and a declaration of war, or
aftuady making war, without a forma! declara:ion.
; :rc considered aj doing away ali compafts or treaties
made by or between .he fame parties. Some doubts
may arise inJhe United States, whether all the force
of treat es can be destroyed without a fpecific legida
tive aft; since treaties are made by the President and
Senate, and vSar, eitljer by declaration or other wife,
cin hav a . no leg tunaii origin, but with the legiflatu'e
âlf this reasoning be not conclusive, the peculiar fi
j tuaticn of the United States, forbids a conclusion,
that wantot precedcat fliou'd defeat this bill.
' Gentlemen have fail, we have reason to believe Mr.
Gerry is now negocia ing a treaty with the French
government: but if the gentlemen will pcrufe the
Jaft meflfageefrom the President, containing dispatches
from Mr, Gerry himTelfâthey will find no such thing
â-and the President has exphci f ly declared all negeci
ation is at ao end; and that they should not, Under
present cjrcuin&ances, be rgain attempted.

FRANCE and AMSRfC
' A French pap r, The Bien Infant;', of
the (JrtH of June, contained a detailed ac
count of thi-* steps the French mitiif
ter of fortign affairs Was taken to juftify
himfelf from tlie imputations which the pub
lication of the documents relative to the
j American negotiation at Paris had thrown
' upon him. ThiVcomplicated aCcount-cfn
j fifts of a correfpondeuce between Tailey
-1 rand Perigerd and Mr. Gerry, on he fob
â  jeifl of the publication, and the myllical cha
{ radters ailurled to irt it, und -r the titles of
IW X Y ind Z- T'jjl correfpondeuce, is
! preceded by a !.iÂ£pured defence of the con
; duÂ£t of the French government with refpejl
i tr) America, and enclpvonrlo refute
! charges which the American documents
' contain.
j It is impoffib!" for ua at present to go
further into this voluminous article, than to
extracl two or three. pafiages from it, by
which it will appear that the main objedl ot
; the French min>fter of foreign affairs is, to
(hake from his own shoulders the disgrace of
having been privy to an â  prdpofitious of a
corrupt nature. How he has succeeded in
this, our readers willjudgefrom the following
1 extradl :
| " Such is the fttuation of the man, who
; ever he may be, who is placed at the head
of this department, that he is obliged to re
ceive and to listen to a number of persons
who are far from enjoying any (hare of his
confidence, without his having any means of
preventing the abuse they make of these un
meaning and infignificant visits, of which
they avail themselves with heedless iiexpe
rience, in order to promote their own inter
ested views.
" Ih the publication which the American
government has given of the account of its
commiflioners, the names of unacknowledg
ed persons are designated by an initial letter.
â¢The minister impatient to dilcover their
names, peremptorily required they should
be given up to him, and at length succeed
ed in obtaining the desired communication,
which he immediately deposited in proper
hands It will be learned with pleasure that
they are foreigners, and it will be easily be
lieved that they have been forward in doing
justice to themselves by hastening to quit
the territories of tiie republic. Only one of
these letters designates a Frenchman, who
was not backward in declaring himfelf. The
language nfed by him is irreproachable ; he
is announced as having sometimes aÂ£led as an
interpreter, but itisevidentthat he interpret
ed none but honourable proportions.
" But as to the foreigner*, who make a
figure in this negoeiation, it appears that
the whole objeÂ£l of their intrigues was to
obtain from the Americans a sum of twelve
hi!: dred i ItoWand livresi in ci'der to be dis
tributed for purpoies of corruption. v,._
hence arise, and here terminate ail the bus
tle, all the itifinuations, all the reports, so
minutely detailed.â¢ the account of the A
meritfin comaiiffioners."
Citizen Talleyrand having surmounted,
as he thinks, ose of his greatest difficulties,
proceeds to compliment in most fulfome
terms, Mr. Gerry, who, he fays, was not
imposed upon by these intiiguersâand for
this clear reason, it was artfully managed
that no corrupt propofilions should be ad
vanced in his hearing; by th s manoeuvre one
part of the American embassy was playing
off againlt the other in such a way as to keep
the different members of it at variance as to
the apparent condudl of the French minister,
and even at a loss in refpeft t& their own ul
timate objedl in the negociation.
It is evident, however, that citizen Tal
leyrand was not prepared for such a ftate
meut as the American commissioners have
laid open to the world by the following pas
sage, which precedes his declamatory con
clusion.
" The whale ofthefefafts offers such atif
fue of incongruities and the
mind is bewildered in them. One is at a : ofs
how to date with precision the reproaches
that ought ;o be made to the American
commiflioners
" Bat it maybe clearly seen and under
(lood, that they have been most strangely de
ceived, if they have believed, and that they
are the more perfidious if they have not be
lieved, what they have related. In the ex
preffimi of these reproaches which are tarn
from indignation, we mufl moflJludioufly ex
clude Mr. Gerry whq, doubtless, may have
been deceived both by the foreign intriguers,
and perhaps even by his "own colleagues ;
for in him no suspicion of badfaith or infmce
ri/y can attach."
All this flattery of Mr. Gerry is easily
accounted for : he was not so alive to the
iniufts offered his country, as his associates.
He can fee a very smooth road of negociati
on yet open between the two republics !
But to come to the curious conclusion of
the French minifler's defence :
" There were doubtless great objefls ia
view which made them (the French and A
merican ministers) hazard holding out, as
discoveries of the highest important:*, the
incoherent tales of two foreign intriguers
connefted with France. Perhaps they sup
posed that the citizens of the United States
of Ametiea would ferman ideaofthe French
government from these caricatures, 9nd
that the French government would be irri
tated by so pointed a provoca ion.âTney
calculated the effedt of the insult from ths
malignit) of the intention, and not from the
littleness of the means. In a word, they
flattered themielces with exciting indignati
on instead of pity. They wished foÂ»war;.
they wished that France, infuited, should
declare war against the people whole cause
(he had defended, nnd that the people should
through their own efforts, be replaced ua- |
der the dominion of England.
" By means of that vrar the Briti.li cabi- Â«
net would gain sn a lit whowruld labor for j
its irtereftâwho wohld second its projeils ,
.against the Fre-ach i d Soanifh colonies a"d i
etard the monvnt rf its humiliation By;
menus alCo of that w.tr the Bri i(h cabi tt 1
accelerates the execution ufa pun of which
it had never loft fi^ht.
" It is well known that as soon as it def
f paired of rf-umUvg to the triple urown the
- States whose independence it wss compelled
to acknowledge, it at haft endeavoured to
y revive in their minds prejudices favourable
- to limited monarchy ; that they endeavour
e ed-to fortify by tht analogy ofconftitution
n al forms, the habitudes th.it were common
to the Englifti and American people, and
that they took to keep for a UngUt of
1 time in the vicinity of the United States,
- i one of the fohs <if j: 11. Can it
f then be coaceivrd to be tr.Â«t that, to 'he
s degradation of the human miiid, there shall
be found a number of American citizens se
t rioufly inclined to the Enghfh form of gov
s ernment ? Can it be true ihat men, ca'led
s by the public confidence to tie head of the
government of the United States, llvuld
3 have wr tten in favour of tlie British cois
i ftitution, merely in order to prepare the a
s doption of it in their own coustry ? Ctn
t it be flue that a thirst for honours, that a
> greediness for wealth, that a deliie of con
s tit/'.iing in power (hould have already matn
a red this conspiracy against the cause of frte
i dom ?
I ' It were henceforward fuperfiuous to

A Jew named Matheo has published in Italian

' the philosophy whic+i guides the chiefs of that

LONDON, June 10.
Thelateft letters from Switzerland state,
that the French commiflioiier Rapmat had
written to the He veticDire&orv. question
ing the sovereignty of the Swiss Republic,
and' calling the treasures upon which the
â¢ French seal had been put, at Berne and
other places, the property of the French
Republic. The Hivetc Directory, on the
' refolu ion of the afTetr.bly, have d manded
an explanation, declaring their independence,
and their determination to prelerve it at the
hazard of their lives.
We intimated that a cor.fiderable part of
the residue of tftie army of England" had
been ordered to the interior. Part of it has
within thife few days been recalled to the
coast ; not for the purpose of invafioa, but
to repel the attr.cks every where apprehend
ed from the a&ive gallantry of fir Richard
Strachan ; who, one day at Havre, the
next at Cherbourg, thi? third at La Hogue,
proclaims nlorc â¢ ffethialiy to ths pÂ»ople of
France the duplicity of their rulers than
could the eloquence as even a dozen men
like Mr. Pitt, if it were ~pofiible the world
could produce them.
We have reafon'to belive that the manner
in which the French were received by-thÂ«
handful of gallant'fellows at St. Marcou,
will prevent their freedily making those
rocks another vifitv Th*v are dated, by
the lafl accounts from the continent, to
have a&ually. 101 l 1100 men ktlkd "and
drowned, brfides a- co.ufiderable number
wounded. Their objeft at present is the
conqueft'of Jersey, Guernsey, and Alder
ney ; for which purpose they have 14.000
folders in, and ready to embark 011 board
the flotilla ; but we hope and believe that
wherever they may go they will be treated
as th^yVught.
Mr- Todd, the late secretary to the poft
ofiice,~who died on Thursday, was appoint
ed to.that situation in the year 1732, for
some time pall his memory wholly failed

MY LORD,
I Am concerned to acquaint your Gr.ice
that accounts received fft.m maj. gen. Nu
gent this morning art not so favourable as
ftom the deiij'ls which were yesterday re
ceived I had reason to hope. A body cf
rebels having affcmbled near Saiotfield, they
Â«erc attacked by a detachment under col.
otaplcton, who at firft fu(ferÂ«d some losÂ»,
but he afterwards put the rebels to flight. .
Being ordered to proceed to Newtown
Ardes, colonel Stapleton found the rebels
in pofltfiion of the town, upon which gen.
Nugent ordered him to retire until his force
could be augmented. ,
There is no official account as to-the body
of rebels which were to be attacked by briy.
gen. Knox, at Tooir.e bridge- Private a'-rcounts state that they have been dispersed.
I have the honor to be, &c.

MY LORD,
I Have the honor to acquaint your grice,
that accounts have been t' is day received
from rnaj. gen. Nugent, who is t Belfaft,
which date, that the information he had re
ceived of a larjre body of reb-Is having en
trenched themfclves near Toome Bridge,
was lunfoundtd. One arch of the bridge
had been broken down an inconfidcrable J
party, which had been dispersed ; the bridge .
has been since ren- ered passable.
Col. Clavering has reported from Antrim â¢
to maj. gen. Nugent that the difaffe&ed in
the neighbourhood of the town had expref- t
fed a desire to submit and return to their j
duty At Ballymena, 150 mulkets and 4
800 pikes had been given up to the magifc
trates. Many arms, 500 pikes, and a brass ;
field piece, have been surrendered to major
Seddon.
Maj. gen. Nugent exprefles his warmed Â£
acknowledgments to the regulars, militia and ( -
yeomanry lorces under his cummand for t
their alertness, zeal and spirit.
Other advices date, that lieut. col. Stew- |
art, having marched from Blaris with a part
oT the Argyll fencib'es, 30 cavalry, and f
some yeomanry, arrived ai Ballynahinch as
the rebels were beginning to collect. He
relieved fdme yeom n who were in their pof- |
fefli n, and the rebels fled into lord Moira'Â«
whither they pursued about 46 of them were t
killed, and the remainder difperftd.
By a letter received this morning frcm
m j. gen. Sir Charles Afgil!, it appears that
he had attacked a rebel camp at the RoÂ»r
near Rofs, which he Completely dispersed,
jo men were killed, and their leader.

DUBLIN CASTLE, June 16.
-ThiÂ« morning advices were received from major
general Jogent. By them it apjiearj that there- I
hela, wUo had been defeated by them at Ballyna 1
hince, have petitioned for pardoa, Â«ad off-red to
fuirender up all their arms and ammunition
The major general, in reply, promised so accept
fuhmiflion, on the condition of their giving up '
their leader, Monroe, and the other principal 1
trait rs who had instigated them to their lare wick- (
ed graitice? They were to surrender by 1Â» <>'- (
clock on the 15th. Monroe was, however, taken j
by general Kugent early on that morning.
Major general Nujrent, alluding o the affair at 1
Bailynahinch, dates the Wfs of the rebels to hve 1
exceeded 500 men, and that many have been since
made prisoners. The general particularly states (
his acknowledgments for the services of major ge- ,
Beral Barber.
He mentions also, with great the 1
eonduA of Mt. Boyd of Bally calle Mr. M'- 1
Naghten kad sent to warn him of his danger,
which induced him to retreat on Friday ljfl to Col

his own, he returned to Bally aftle, and beat the ,
ytfeels Witjyf the iilace, and lie is now proceeding !

Captain Stewart, of the Glenarm yeomanry, :
and captain Matthews, of the FoTtaferry yeoman- I
ry, have behaved uncommonly well in repulsing i
large bodies of rebels, who attacked them with
great fury.
General Nueent speaks generally of the con
duit of all the yeomanry in his diftriift in tl e
warmed terms of approbation, and mention that
he had thanked them all.
RASTADT, June 1.
The Prnflian Minister resident here, ac
cording to what has has declai
ed to the French Minister Bonnier, that the
unexpefted demands on the part of the Re
public, commuuicated in the last note rela
tive to the fortreffes upon the right (bore of
the Rhine, have made a very sensible Im
prcflion upon his Prussian Majesty, pecu
liarly as the Ring can view those demands
in no other l'ght tha" as offenfivc and me
nacing meafntes, which will oblige his Ma
jesty to continue his cautionary prepara
tions : Ehrenbeitftein, he contends, (hou d
beconfid red as a fortrefs calculated tcr the
defence of the North of Germany, and ne
c<Warily included in the line of his obferva
tio '. The Prnflian Minister added at the
fame tims, that the king had no design to
enter into any new coalition, provided the
French gave up the demand* above menti
oned. his Majedy having no objeftion to
their peaceful poffeffio* of those countttes
upon the left fide < f the Rhine ceded to
thÂ«m by the Empire.
Another letter fame date.
The Imperial Envoys have solemnly de
clared they can by no means agree to the
late demands of the French ; thde being in
confident with the independence ot the
rGerman Empire, and dangerous in relpett
ito the tranquility of other dates.
People are full of expedition for the lflue
of Prince Repnin's negociatioos at Berlin,
and those of Count Cobenzal at Seltz, which

HEALTH OFFICE,
September 1, 1798.
FELLOW-CITIIENS,
Impelled by the awful progress and un
paralleled malignity of the prevailing fever,
we are conflrained to address your feelings,
as well as your reason, in order to avert the
fatal d<-ftruftiori which, with rapid ftriden,
is pervadi-g our ill fated ciiy and fubur'is.
The beft'lkill of our physician*, and all
the powers of medicine, it must bs aeknow
ledged, have prov d unequal it) the coated
with this devouring poison-
With the mod affeiSing sympathy and '
anxious solicitude, we have to the b ft of
our judgments, endeavoured to employ, as
circumstances appeared to tequire, the pow- j
er and the means entruded to Us, in arrest
ing its progrtfs, and allevi itin* its concomi
tant miseries. We (hall con'i juc to em
ploy them with unremitting zeal; but we
have neither the power nur the raean> to
accotmplifh all the measures neceflary
to check its extension, or provide for the
prefling exigencies of the moment. The
powers dels g,ated, and appropriations made
by law. to the institutions under our direc
tion, are impotent indeed, when compared
to the magnitude of the occasion.
It remiins for our fellow citiz ns to at
tain, by their energy, the end* which alone
can ft p its progrtfs and diminish its horror?.
We have, i'i conjunction with the Guar
dians of the Poor, caused tents to be ereÂ£t
ed on the east b? k of the Schuy'killj for
accommodation jj' the ihdiuÂ«n't ; wliere
near twelve lundred are already provided
for, out of the fui.d appropriated tor tha or
dinary relief of the poor. This is but a
partial mitigation of the evils wtokh
environ >h ufr.a.ls o jve a claim up n
tire philanthropy <Â»f tWofa who are in more
fortunate circumstances.
The difficulty i f prep r ng a place of re
fuse, at prtfent, in thecoun'ry, is too well
known ; nnd the expence att nding the re
moyal of a fan ily has difenuraged mary
fron the aft-mpt, who ar-.- in circumftaqccs
to live comfortably at home.
What remains obe done ? Citizens of
refpe^tability and influ ncel Come forward,
and form yourfclves into a committee for
the purpose of crafting on the weft bank
of the Schuylkill, all the tents that can be
colle&ed; let the tents be floored with
boards, and made as comfortable as poflible ;
if tents cannot be had, boards in a undance
may be procured for the ereftion of shedÂ».
Admonish those citizens who have no place
of refuge, to take shelter there, particularly
those from the east part of the city, the dif
trift of Southwark, andthe Northern Liber
tiesâin (hort, ALL who can leave their
homes without injury ; sxcept
those who are neceflary for the proteftion
of the city and liberties.
The committed (hould have th- general
fuperistendarce and regulation of the tents,
and authority to prei'erve order ; contrad
for certain supplies of bread, meat, vegeta
bles, wood, See at the lowed poflible rates,,
Those who are rfot in circumstances to pay,
must Ae supplied by public bounty. ,
It is at bed an unequal, perhaps an unjust
mode of railing money by an appeal to the
humanity of generous individuals ; but if on
any occasion it may be juftified, the present
may be assumed without hesitation.
We call your attention to the aftual and
undiffiuifed state of our city. Consider the
mortality and rapid increase of the sick at so
early a period. View the lift of your phy
sicians, and mark how few art at their pqjls ;
a-d we believe ytu will think with tis, that
the prefervatipn of health is only to be at
tained by flight.
Do not flatter yourfel;eÂ», fellow-citizens,
that this pi&ttre is too highly coloured , we
speak from conviftion, and a knowledge ef
faSs ; atiS doubt not,' ut that the lives of
hundreds, perhaps of th ufands, may he pre
served by the adoption of these or similar
mcafures.

in the Ciry and ;Jie othe' at Germant wn,.for
the purpose of forming Ticket for the ensuing

Materially different :nd as tio h are of equal
aub iritv and rcfje-ftab iâ  t\ , it is impoiible to I
know which has the paramount claim tÂ® public r

animadvert upon the ref|>Â«Â£live merits of these
two editions of Tickets, but-to hare thi du- ?
plicate bufmels reduced to forrie p radical form, "
that 'he public mind may know on wh>tt to 8

Alerting (for the two mentioned can haw no ei

the above dtfi ription be {lad in eight or tea c

Messrs Chiypoelr, tr
Having lately read in several Philadelphia d;
papers an extraA of a letter from Kir. William
Wrwd, dated Ali;ezir;Â«, June 3, irgS, to his
brother at New-York, abusing tin cHara.'icr of
Joseph Yznardi, Esq. ailing conlul foe the .
United States of America at Cadiz and the dif
tricl attached theretoâand having lived some l '
monthst!rider the hofpitaMercofof M r Yznirdi,
which afforded me daily opportunities of wit- n
netting hiÂ» c, ntinual chanty to, and unwearied tl
consular exertions in beha.t of* Aoiericms, fuf
fering by illeg-tl captures and otherwift, and
being lully persuaded that Mr. Yznardi, who is
highly esteemed by :he Spanish merchants as a
man of probity and honour, is a juit and upright 1
charatfer, ami always firadyio assist theeitizens J
of the country he has the honour to represent, n
by advice and other means, lam led to believe, 0
with all deference tp the cha'atfrrof Mr. Wood,
that his letter has been written under wrong 1 .
impreflions; and here Mr. Wood will give ine , '
leave to obl'erve, this is not at all extraordinary, j s
when we recoiled the many envious and delign- i .
ing charadlers, that are perpetually hanging 1
about strangers in that country, for the very a
purpose of deceiving them, which they do not tl
find a difficult talk, particularly when the V
stranger dots not nnderffand the"Spani(h lan- o
guage, which is the cafe with Mr. Wood. tl
. As newspaper publicationi are oftentimes too o
readily believed, I have thought proper to op- tl
pole that tendency in Mr. Wood's, in behalf of
my friend, to whom I shall fend the extrafl
fr m Mr. Wood's letter, and doubt not but he "
will, as foou as possible, enable me, or some other
perfÂ»H to lay before the public a full statement 0
of the tjanfailioÃS that have led to these publi
cations; until which time I trust a generous â
public will f'jfpsnd their opinion. Principles
of justice and fiiendfhip being my only motive
for stepping forward in defence of the character -1
of Mr Yznardi, who is not present to speak for J
himfelf, will, I trust, rendy an apology to the n
public for thus intruding upon them unne- r

where the mod aftonilhing cure? have been effect
ed on pcrfons judged incurable by all physicians.
In aTrcatife printed in London, on the properties
of this* by T. Seymour, M. D. lateChc
mift to hi* Majesty, there are stated two hundred,
cases, where this moil valuable remedy has proved
infallible, in all kind of fevers, pleurisy, Llcody Jlux,
inverate rheutnatifms, Jciatica, apoplexy, patalyjie, yel-
I err jaundice, ringworm, worms in children and in ; row*
pcrfons, whitej, chronical head and flomach aches, hepw

ana measles ; ol the greatcft utility for young a?
j well as lor elder ladies ar the critical epoch of their
j life. The tflr-acy of this powder in ltveral of the
j above diseases has been dilcovered by chance, and
so it has been in the yellow fever last year, by Mr.
