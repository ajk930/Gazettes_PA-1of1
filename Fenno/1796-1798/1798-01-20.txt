SCIPIOâNo. xu. pu<
It waÂ» not tny intention tÂ« temark on a- me
ny inconfiftencics which might appear to me jfer
between Mr. Monroe's narrative lince his re- an
'call, ami hiÂ« letters Written at Paris: There vei
is one, however, I liiuft notice. In hit nar- wl
rative written in >797 after hie recall he h.iÂ» eal
i ventured to reprefdnt that, " the poffefiion /oj
; of the treaty enabled the French governmeÃt t Fr
to judge for itfelf upon all the points which. C u:
it involved; and that the effeft was not an rfa
equivocal one for thefadid not appear to be \vc
a description of perfone not in the intereft;of of
the coalesced powers, who did not opcilly inj
and severely censure it." (page 34) In a tw
following page he ha# Hated that,' " theap- fie
pearance of the treaty excited the general U n
disgust of France againll the American gov- fa 1
ernment which was now diminilhed by thÂ«- foi
opposition which the American people >"*Â° e th:
to the treaty." Already I have cWd hiÂ» tai
letter of 17th AugoA, written n a^tcr rei
the treaty appeared at Paris; sni his ' c "er gr
â  of 20th Oftober, which exprrfsly contradiit i nj
this representation. If, however, it is to be
believed that Mr. Monroe has more (truly fu
fiated the impressions of France, at the light ou
of the treaty in his narrative of 1797 than f u
in his letter of 1795. it will follow that lie til
will appear in a more culpable light than I bl
have been disposed to view hjm. It \vill
prove that he so much longer neglected thole dt
friendly explanations whieb it was his duty w
to have offered rtfpefting the treaty. From at
bU torrefpondenee it appears that,not qpfy fc
after thetwÂ»>Â«iy -'4*P ea "" 31 even
iflur he Iw 4 received in OiSober 1795 thj; 3
of the President, he. did not so- n;
licit an audience of the dircftory on tbif sub- ai
jest till the sth March 1796, a space of fv
fifteen months from the ecnclnlion of the {<
treaty and about seven months after it had d
been published in Paris, and four mouths as- tl
ter be had received the copious comments
on the treaty, from the Secretary of ft
contained in hi* letter of June, and the an- t<
fwer to Mr. Adet's objections. Nor did u
Mr. Monroe dcÂ£re an audience before he S
had been *old by the minister of foreign as- tl
fairs that, the direftory had made up its mind n
how to aft concerning the treaty. That he ii
(Itould have been an indifferent fpeftator to p
the discontented feelings of France before, a
and while it was coming to a mature deter- a
mination, and should, immediately after he f
was informed that such a determination was P
taken, request an audience of the dire&ory 0
II on the fybjÂ«Â£t; muit be admitted to beftrong a
(1 evidence, not only of negligence but of in- a
capacity. Let it be noted that, neither' his e
. letter of 22d December 1795-, nor that of Â£
[. 26th January 1796, contained a word on h
the treaty. ii
In hisletterof 16th.February 1796, be a
â¢ has informed the Secretary of State, that he g
had eallcd the day before, on the minister r
of foreign affairs to represent the dittreffes of d
several of his countrymen, but before he was r J
allowed to enter on the fubjeft, his atteflti- t
on was called to the treaty, by the minister <
of foreign affairs, who observed " the direSo- r
ry had at length made up its mind, how to aH 1
id concerning our treaty with England; that it f
considered the alliance between us as ceasing 1
to exist, from the moment the treaty was rat f
ified; andhad, orfbould appoint anenvoyex- !
_ tra-ordinary, to represent the fame to our j
government, Icc. that he should hand to ,
me an official note on this fubjedt, being or- j
dered to do so by the Dire&ory" See. (page
, 311) Mr. Monroe further confirmed that 1
as no fptcific objeftion was made, he could 1
u make no fpecific reply: That he expressed ]
' ft his aftonilhment at the measure proposed, ]
. inculcated the propriety of candour in dif- 1
cuffing the treaty; and intended to demand
an audience, for the purpose of diverting
- France from the measure.
On the 20th of February he wrote that,
he had obtained a conference with
the minister of foreign affairs, concerning ihe
' miHion of an envoy to America j - thaths had
0. rcmcmftrated against thÂ« measure, and- had
declared that- he was aVaya ready to enter
.into explanations relative to the treaty " when
required, aud would do it- with pleasure" ;
to which the minister replied that, France
had much canfe of complaint against us, in.
B " dependenlly of our treaty with England, but,
that by this treaty, ours with them was an
nihilated; but admitted -that the objections _
i U9 to the million of an Envoy to America,"
which had been urged, had much force in
them, and should be considered. It is add
,Â° f ed in this letter tbat he (Mr. Monroe) ex
to peÂ£ted he might be called on for explanati
ch ons of the trtaty, in which cafe he should
*t avail himfelf in the best manner of the cona
,ns municatiens he had received from the de
partment of State.
ns The plan of fending an envoy to Ameri
ea was laid aside and, whether the oppositi
on of Mr. Monroe to this measure was judi
â eious or not, I will not venture to decide.
It' is probable however, it would not have
made things worse with this country than
we now fiud them; and our explanations and
arguments would have been as ably urged in
â¢rs, Philadelphia as any where else. But if Mr.
vas, Monroe had already been guilty of unwar
-.h raritable negligence in permitting the direc
' tory to make tip its mind without any pre
vious difcufiion, or reprefentationof the trea
ty in our behalf, this negligence became in
>py excufeable and fatal, by his subsequent con
v duÂ£t. Inftcad of telling the minister of fo
rtcr reign affairs, he was ready when required by
de- the French republic, to" give explanations
Â»*K- 011' this fubjeft; he ought to have feut him
l Â°k immediately", a written communication, em
bracing every particular which he bad heard,
or believed might have occasioned ?ny dif
falibfattion. Let it be remtmbered, Mr.
!CU " Monroeinhisletterof the 17th August 1795
had told the President he expected tÂ» bear r.i
complaints, unless in reply to hTTreprefc'mlatiins.
With this opinio^'"if Ms. W<

}m endtaTÃuriag to remove (fee uneasiness of jh
France, but by aftually eommcnu-jgihe dif- tb
cuffioo on his part, and not merely by Â«fc- to
daring his to enter U PÂ°" lt " Thls ,
would have l*eri executing the expeditions a a
of the executive, whose anxious and unceaf- .tn
in? wish to preserve harmony between the
two countries had been 011 ail occalions tefti- tn
ficd to him. If theEe endeavours hid been ti<
upfuccefsfal, though it would have been the bi
iburce of infinite regret, it would have at- l>*
â  forded coufqlatiun to refleft, that every
thiag had been flor.e that was poffibtc to ob
tain success. He ought not so long to have
remained in Paris, a silent witness to tht
growing discontent of France, without mak- 111
ing fame exertion to diminish or remove it.
All the remedies which the executive could ">
supply, were in his hands, and certainly he a'
ought to have tried their efficacy in due sea- f e
fat" and jiot have deferred their application g 1
till the difeafc had probably become incura-
L) 1 * '
It is true that in March Mr. Monroe did
: demand an audience 0/ lhÂ« direftory, which |
' was granted. That having demanded the 2 '
1 audience, hÂ£ was obliged to open the cou
fereuce, .tfiat the fefult was that they on
1 nÂ»ifti/l**.of foreign affairs tÂ«i_fsnd_iS
; a note <jf 5 Aw* complaints to the American f
- miniiter, which was done soon afterwards, 11
- and to \\'hi:h Mr. Monroe returned an an- *'
f fwer. But wgs entirely QUt of fca- I'
! sonâit wai a month after the direftory had 0
1 determined on tbtir course of conduft as ol
- they had etprefsly informed him. r f
t I will s nÂ»t fay that. any thing that Mr. rl
â¢ Monroe eoild have done, would have diver- 11
- ted France from her present offenfive and ir
1 nnjuft fyilem. The people of the United fl
e States ar< defendants from'the British, and <;
- though fcparate and-independent in govern- '
{ ment, yet speaking the fam<t language, alike
e in manmrs, connected by commerce, and c '
a prcfefiinj; the ehriftian religion. The French P
, are led to contemplate us as Englilhmen, J 1
- and from their hatred to England, are not
e sparing <Â£ their injuries to us. But surely Â£
s Mr. Moiroe ought to have used his endeav- '
f ors, witk vigilance, constancy and sincerity; "
5 and he ftould have used them in due season, '
- and with his utmost ability, to correal the v
s erroneous opinions and to dissipate the un- "
f favorable prejudices which the treaty might
n have excited. FrÂ« m the executive he had y
in due time received the fulleft direftions, 1
e and-bad been not oply reminded how to re- c
e gulate his foture conduft, but had been f
:r reproved for some instances of his mifcon- 1
>f dust, so early as the 23d,November, 1795. 1
is The secretary of (late wrote him a iliort let- c
i- ter of which the following is an extraft. c
:r " I write now merely to acknowledge the 1
j- receipt of your several letters numbered 16,
S 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. Youwillfeean an- 1
it fwer to'the last has been anticipatedbyalong

ir you will undtrjlandthat the ideas you have

r- gevermneni of the United States"â (page 3'9)
je Even this did not stimulate him to aftion, '
at but it was reserved for the, minister of fo
ld reing affairs to rouse him from his lethargy, '
:d by tellinghim positively that France had at
d, length made bp it* mind' how to aft con- '
if- cerning the Britilh treaty. After this pe
'd riod it naight have have been forefeetl that 1
ig his representations would be unavailing;
and so they were. The proper feafou had
t, pa(Ted by, unimproved, and it was never to
th be reealled. The discontent of France was
it- grown to maturity, and what might have
id been only a trarilient prejudice, was become
a fixed opinion,

it back to the grofin.d on which itftood pre
vious to its beingextended in the vear 1796.
It was absolutely neceflary to take a view thi
of this fubjeft, aid to prevent tin; increase '7
of expence under this head, foV a variety of "a
reasons. He believed that the benefits de- Ui
rived from government did not depend so
mqch upon their form, as upon the manner hu
in which they were executed. He believ- " e
ed there was a tendency in all governments he
conflituted like ours, to an union and con
solidation of its different parts, so as to de- ral
ftroy all the benefits intended to be produ- 00
ced from its divifioa. Th'e most convincing th
proofs might be adduced to %shew that it th
might be foabufed as to become the most
burdensome and oppressive government' on ln
earth. If, for instance, an uniou could be va
formed between the executive and a major- j to
ity of both branches of the legiflatnre, so |
that they came to aft uniformly inonecourfe, j P r
where would then be the check upon the ; w
mcafuresof governmertt ? It would be in a
foeble minority only, confiding of perfoni
whose charafters were not fufficiently known at
in this extensive country, to gfvc-tlÂ»Â«uÂ» agy w
chance of attrafting public notice to the o
! perations of government. It was, there- 11
. fore, particularly neceflary to guard against | c
the encreafe of executive patronage ; be- in
. cause the number of representatives in that Cl
department of government was small, in tn
Â» proportion to their constituents ; and their |t
power of gaining influence was great, in p
! proportion to the fmallnefs of their num- 11
r ber. It was, therefore, neceflary to at-
tend te the patronage entrusted to this t<
3 branch of the government, as he was sorry e
r to fay that he believed that patronage had b
been made use of to influence the public tl
e mind in a particular direftion ; as it was ti
\ a faft very evident that no man could be ad- n
( mitted into the offices of the government of ti
this country, unless he made a facrifice of c
allpoliticalopinion to executive infallibility. v
J There was another reason for adopting si
the change which he propofd. Our put- p
lie agents abro&d were mostly cbofen from p
t the iegiflature itfelf; and it was worthy of o
. serious consideration, that the most attraft- f
ive offices which government had to bestow, f
were filled with legislative charafters.
g Mr. N. said his own opinion with refpeft Â£
s to foreign diplomatic intercourse was, that 1
we Ought to havp none. We Ihould be bet- v
ter without any fort of political intercourse '
with foreign nations, and he (hould, wish t
commerce to be left to seek its own mar- f
kets. He did not wifti, however, to set up t
J. bis opinion as a standard in* this business ;
all he desired was to bring it back to its o- <
riginal establishment. In order to effeft I
j. this he proposed to strike out the word ple
nipotentiary, in the loth line, and insert "tb -
v- the French republic or Great-Eritain," and
r. to make such other alterations in the fee
ill tion as to make it accord *vith thTs idea.
On former occafionsit had been affined,Â«
e. that this house.had no right to aft in any
manner which did not concurwith the views
a- of the executive, with refpeft to our diplo
x- matic intercourse with foreignjnations. 0 n
id examining the constitution, he was fatisfied
3n that it was not consonant to its Tpirit to fay
of tfte legislature had not power over this fub
ve jest. The President had the power of choof
or ing foreigÃ.minifters, but the constitution
cb did not fay he might employ them as he
iat should think fit.âMr. N. said he had had
ifc the curiosity of recurring to the debate
ry when the. diplomatic corps was firfl inftitut
les ed, and he found his opinion abundantly
:d, confirmed by what then tpoli place. He
ter there found it to be the clear understanding
>e~r 'of the house, that congref; hafd thf' povvcr
jo- to fay there should be such a number of mi
jirl nifters, of this or that description, at such
id* and such a salary. Â£To confirm this pofi
af Mr. N. read several extracts from the
lan debates 011 tRe occafion.T At the time of ;
ol- palling their. W, it was thought belt'to leave
in- the li*ing of the salaries to the President, ;
J becaufeit might be necelFary to give 'differ
am ent salaries li the fame grade of miniftcrs,
re- !nt different courts But as it was seen that
ur- the President had never thought it neceflary
ign to make any difference ia this refpeft, it was
'rÂ«- no longer neceflary for the house to give up
ted t'that power to the President. He thought,
thertfori, it would be proper to f. r,u
Vies ai the rate heretofore'fixed h ', c p'.f /
fident, to retrench the extract, ,

ami Portugal, â d w &JJZZ3Z
ifter at Berlin, as soon as he had fioj&H a
ny business upon which he might be,-..,.
Ed, and as loon as the information could be
to him. A minister at that co uk
he looked upon a, wholly unneeefTary. We
had httlc or no connection with that coun
try, and he d;dl not. w.lh any to be created. .
He thought, therefore, the house ought to

j r from effedh to causes with a witness to it.
i n No contradiction was more palpable. But,
n. it was feid, there was danger from the exe
t- cutive influence âdanger of 1 -giflat jrs be
is ing bribed by the hopes or promifrt of for

id been urged on former cccafians. When
ic the appropriation was made for a minitter
as to Berlin, the gentl:man frorrVirginia then"
d- made a Jiarnl (as he terms it.) He then
of told the house the appointment wis unne"-
of celfary ; but, uolwilhllanding the money

fraid of executive influence. If this ap
b- pointment had been improper, that was the
m proper time to have prevented the extension
of of our foreign intercourse ; but, after a
a- full discussion, the extension was deemed
iv, proper. What verfatiiityâwhatfrolifhnefi

Mr. Allen said, that bv the bill before ;
the committee they were brought to confi- '
der what provision should be made for the
Ministers of the United States abroad.â
He wifiled the gentleman from Virginia had
produced fails to the committee which, by
being ccmfidered, might have been ailed u
pon ; and when he had propofcd to have '
wimfters plenipotentiary at two courts on- !
ly, it would have been well if he had fliewn ,
wlty there should be ministers of that des
cription there, and not at other courts, or
, jvhy we ihoujd minitters abroad
at all; but after listening to him with ati
tention, he had been able to hear nothing
from him but general declamation. What
he intended for arguments, he thought illy
applied to a government like this. He had
strongly warned"the house again ft Executive
patronage. He spoke of the different de
partments of government as diftinft bodies,
.having different interests ; as if the Exe
cutive wasformingapatronageagainft which 1
it was important forthemtoguard. He tho't
language of this kind very improper. He
believed it might hav: a bad effeft out of j
doors, when the people heard of the Exe- '
etitive being thus charged Instead of ma- j '
king these charges, he wished the gentle-I '
man had said, " Cvmc noio, vnd let us rea~ j
fun togcilnr." This would have been pre- i
ferable to calling of hard names, to speak- ' 1
ing of the lust of dominion, and of patron- '
age ; as if one br.Â«cb of the government t '
was in danger "of being swallowed up by the ,
other. / The gentleman had declared that ' i
republican governments might become more ;
burthenfoipe and corrupt than any other, i '
as if the people of the United States were ! '
to i>e informed thisgovernment was progref- |
sing towards that - pointââtowards a point 1
which would Hear it dowh t This language 1
itruck him 'he more, as he doubted not it '
would be faithfully reported. A corhbina- \
tion of all the branches of government was
spoken of, against which there was no se
curity. but in feeble minorities. Did the '
gentleman mean to insinuate that majorities 1
in republican governments were not to be ,
trusted, but that all virtue was in minorities <
âthe enlightened few, who were to be the 1
guides of the people.
Mr. A. said, the gentleman from Vir- J
ginia had told the house that execative pat- ,
ronage was exclusively confined to those who i
came up to the standard of executive infal
libility. This assertion was to spread over '
te United States as a fatt. But were any '
proofs offered to support these charges ? j
No. \et these charge* would go out to â 
the world, and would tend to weaken the t
confidence of the people in the gQvernment, i
and they would of eourfe conclude, that '
such a government ought not to be support- 1
ed, but demolished. Was there any pecu-
liar propriety, he asked, in introducing lan- [
guage of this kind, at this juncture, when f
they were every moment in expectation of t
hearing neivs tKot tfifagreea- <
ble," and require an union of every citizen in- f
the country i Was this a time to fay govern- 1
ment was not to be trusted? He could have f
wished, instead of making these charges, the |
gentleman had reasoned upon the fubjeÂ£l,
that such measures might hrve been taken, t
as true wisdom and love of country should 1
have didlated. But when the gentleman !i
spoke of government departing from the "
principles on which it was instituted, who, "
that believed this, could refpe6l it? But he u
had himfelf, even heard native Americans, g
who had not been poisoned by aÂ«y foreign w
influence whatever, declare that such a go- P
vernment as ours could not stand, that it 11
must be overthrown. He believedthat these Â°
opinions were produced by such declarations if
as those they had heard to-day, and such as f,
"if this law puffed, it -would not be carried in- ol
to effect by tl>e courts of the Jlates," which was c(
language used on a former occasion.
Mr. A. concluded by faying, the com f '
mittee were told that our foreign intercourse
ought not to be continued. He eonfeffed tf
that this country had reason to with that so- tfi
reign inttreourfe,, so far as it related to im- a {
porting intriguing foreigners, had long ago ' e
ceased. He believed there were persons in -T
---that house, who thought the government
ought to be overset, and that it could not,
and ought not to be supported, and who be- be
lieved that the most effectual way of deftroy
it was to destroy the confidence of the peo
pie in the individuals who administer it. He ' iÂ£
wished the House to affumt the true Amcri- !j?
can character.
Mr. Nicholas assured the gentleman im
just lat down, that he might fay what he to
pleased of him, he was at liberty to proclaim be
him ia what charafter he pleased : it would ou
not affeft him in the least. With refpeft to Pa
the charge he brought against him for infin
uatipg without authority, that a preference f U [
was given by the Executive to persons pro- tbi
feffing certain opinions, he did not make th<
the charge without authority. It was the of
avowed declaration of men who considered an
themselves as guides of the President that " e
this was the cafe. He acknowledged it was p r(
to be lamented, that, at a time when it in i
might be necessary to join in one common exi
cause, that such sentiments should be declar- in 8
ed; but if gentlemen will divide the coun- ver
try into'parties, it was a business of their
own, and not his. What he said was true. |j er
Mr. Gallatin believed that there was a num t
borof people ia the United Statesâpeople other- J| ar
w:!e enlightened, and wl.o upon all commou sub- con
polTefled found un aerftandings, who were l '
fully convinced that there waÂ« a fa.4lon existing *
within the United States, and even within the Â° n
â¢walls of that house who wilhed to demolish the Wat
government; ar.d he further believed that this o ev ll
pinion wis supported by such declarationi as had
made by from Conne>slicut. tlon
Ke ihou!<J be sorry that such a belief Ibould be P ow
considered as dangerous to the fafety of the com- '* evi
munity. Nor could he consider the dÂ«termination 'he i
ox the executive to employ only such persons as was
are of the fame political opinion* with therpfclves, it w
as of such a nature as to pioduce fatal couf -quen- prtJf
ecs, and that government, on that account, was pow
unworthy ot confidence. He believed that such cece:

those institutions, as their arms have progreiled. 0
ThecelebratedHniverfityofParia early fell before ti
them ; That of Louvain it appears hasjuft ex- ti
perienced the fame fate. An empire founded
o* dullness and ignorance mtift needs beat odds o
with learning, and improvement! in eve
ry form; and they have accordingly been per- d
fecuted with a zeal proportioned to the rharadl- a
er and principles of jacobinism. The faithful
rlt-vei of the original lchool, haveflrenuoufly imi- p,
tated in this country her woithy example. But w
as ignorance does not here prevail so generally S<
as to prepare the public for their pÃifowys and qi
unqualified pouons of equality aq'd"fraternity,
their labours have not been attended with the
fame deflruÂ£live fuccef3. The colleges and their
