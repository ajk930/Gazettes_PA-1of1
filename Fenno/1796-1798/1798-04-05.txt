THE enlightened friend of America ne
ver saw gr^afiM-occafion of disquietude than
at the present junfture. Our nation, thro'
' its official organs, has been treated with stu
died contempt and systematic insult ; effen
tfat rights of the country are perfeveringly
violated, and its independence and liberty e-.
ventually threatened, by tfae mod fla
gitious, despotic and vindictive govern
ment that ever disgraced the annals of
mankind ; by a government marching with
j hasty and coloflal strides to universal empire 1
âand, in thÂ« execution of this hideous pro
ject, wielding with abfoiute- authority the
whole physical force of the mod enthralled
but mod powerful i>ation on earth. In a
situation like this, how great is the cause to
lament, how afflidliÃg to every heart, alive
to the honour and interell of its eountry, to
observe, that dillraSed and inefficient coun
cils, that a palsied and utlconfcious state of
the public mind, afford too little aflurance
of measures adequate jitherto the urgency
of the evils which are felt, Â»sr to the magni
tude of th*: dangers which are in profpefk.
When Great-Britain attempted to wrest
from us thofc rights, without which we
mud have defepnded from the rank of free
men, a keen and drong sense of injury and
danger ran with eleftrici fwiftnef* thro' the
: breads of our citizens. _ The mass and
| weight of talents, property and charafter,
hadtned to confederate in the public cause.
The great body of our community- every
! where burnt with a holy zeal t6 defend it,
: and were eager to make facrificps on the
altar of their eountry.
If the nation with which we were called
to contend was then the preponderating
power of Europe ; if by her great wealth
and the fnccefn of her arms she was in a con
dition to hiafst or toawe the cabinets of prin
ces ; if her fleets covered and domineered
over the ocean, facilitating depredation and
invasion ; if the penalties of rebellion hung
over an unfuccefsful conted ; if America
was yet in the cradle of her political exid
ence ; if her population little exceeded two
millions ; if (he was without government,
without fleets or armies, arsenals or maga
zines, without military kn6wledge ; âltili
her citizens had a jult and elevated sense of
her rights, were thoroughly awake to the
violence and injuflice of the attack npon
them, saw the, conduct of her adverÂ£jry
without apology or extenuation ; and, un
der the impulse of these iropreflioiis and
views, determined with little short of una
nimity to hrave every hazard in her defence.
I his magnanimous spirit was the sure pledge
that all the energies of the country \vould
be exerted to bring all its resources into ac
tion, that whatever was poflible would be
done towards effectual opposition ; and this,
combined with the immense advantage of
didance, warranted thÂ« expectation of ul
timate success- The event judified the ex
pedition and rewarded the glorious spirit
from which it was derived.
Far different is the pifture of our present
situation ! The FIVE TYRANTS of
France, after binding in chains their own
countrymen, after prollrating liirrounding
nations, and vatiquifhing all external refid
ance to their revolutionary despotism at
1 home, without the shadow of neceflity, with
no difcernable motive, other than to confirm
their usurpation and extend the sphere of
their domination abroadâThese implacable
tyrants obstinately and remorselessly per
fid in prolonging the calamities of mankind
and feeoi lefolved asfar as they can to mul
: tiply and perpetuate them. Afting upon
the pretention to universal empire, they have
at length in fad, tho' not in aame, decreed
war against all nations not in league with
; themselves ; and towards this country, in
particular, they add to a long train of uri
[ provoked aggrefiions and affronts the in-
I supportable outrage of refufir.g to receive
the extraordinary ambassadors whom we sent
to endeavour to appease and conciliate.â
Thus have they, in regard to us, filled up
ihe.meafure of national insult and humilia
tion. 'Tis not in their power, unkfs we
are accomplices in the drfiga, to fink us
lower. 'Tis'ouly in our awn power to do
this by an abjeft fubmiflion to their will,
j But though a knowledge of the true char
adler of the citizens of this country will
not permit it to be fufpefted that a majori
ty cither in our public councils or in the
community can be so degraded or infatua
ted ; yet to the firm and independent lover
of his country, there are appearances at
once mortifying andalarming.
Among those who divide our legislative
councils, we perceive hitherto, on the one
fide unremitting efforts to juftify or excuse
the despots of France, to vilify arid discre
dit our own government, of course to de
flroy its neceflary vigor, and to dillraft the
opinions and to damp the zeal of our citi
zens, wbat is worse, to divert their affec
tions frffrti their own to a foreign country :
on the other fide, we have as yet seen nei
ther expanded views of our situation, nor
meaf'ires at all proportioned to the feri
oufnels and extent of the danger. While
our independence is menaced, little more is
beard than of guarding our trade, and this
too in very feeble and tremulous accents.
In the community, though in a founder
(late than its representatives, we discover
the vestiges of the fame divilion3 which en
ervate our councils. A few, happily a con
temptible few, prostituted to a foreign en
emy, seem willing that their country fhonkl
become a province to France. SNme of
these dare even to insinuate thÂ£ treasonable
and parricidal sentiment, that in cafe of in
they would join the standard of
France. Another and a more coi.fiderable
part ate weak enough to appear disposed to
facrifiee our commerce, to endure every in
dignity and even to become tributary, ra-"
titer than to encounter war or increase the
chances of it ; as if a nation could preserve
any rights, could even retain its freedom,
which (hould conduct itfelf on the princi
ple os-passive obedience to injury and out
rage ; as if the drbafement of- the public
mind did not include the debarment of
the individual mind and the dereliction of
whatever adorns or exalts human nature ;
as if there could be any security in com
pounding with tyratjny and injustice by de
grading compliances ; as if fubmiflion to
the existing violations of our sovereignty
would not invite (till greater, and whet the
appetite to devour us by the allurement of
an unrefifling prey ; as if war was ever to
he averted by betraying unequivocally a pu
sillanimous dread of it as the greatest of all
evils. ,
This cbuntry had doubtless powerful
motives to cultivate peace. It was its poli
cy, for the fake of this objeft, to go a
great way in yielding secondary interests,
,and to meet injury with patience as long as
it could be done without the manifeft aban
donment of effeatial rights without abso
lute dishonor. But to do more than this is
filicide in any people who have the lead
chance of contending with effeft. The
conduÂ£t of our government has eorrefpon
ded with the cogent inducements'to a pa
cific system. Towards Great-Britain it dis
played forbearanceâtowards France it has
(hewn humility. In the cafe of Great-Bri
tain, its moderation was attended with fug.
cefÂ». But the inexorable arrogance and ra
pacity of the oppressors of unhappy France
barr all the avenues to reconciliation as well
as to redress, accumulating upon us injury
and insult till there is no choice left but be
tween refillance and infamy.
My countrymen ! can ye 'hesitate which
to prefer ? can ye consent to taste the bru
talizing cup of disgrace, to wear the livery
of foreign mailers, to put on the hateful
fetters of foreign bondage ? Will it make
any difference to you that the badge of
your servitude is a cap rather than an epaulet ?
Will tyranny be leffrodious because five in
stead of one inffidt the rod ?âWhat is there
to deter you from the manful vindication of
your rights an d your honor ?
With an icnmenfe ocean rolling between
the United States and Franceâwith ample
materials for ship-building, and a body of
hardy seamen more numerous and more ex
pert than France can boast, with a popula
tion exceeding five millions, spread over a
wide extent of country, offering no one
point, the seizure of which, as of the great
Capitals of Europe, might decide the iflue,
with a foil liberal of all the produ&ions that
give llrength and resource, with the rudi
ments of the mod essential manufa&ures ca
pable of being developed in proportion to
our want, with a' numerous, and in many
quarters wtll appointed militia, with respec
table revenues and a fluurifhing credit, with
many of the principle of taxation
yet untouched,with considerable ar eualsand
the means of extending t,hemÂ» with experi
enced officers ready to form an army under
.the command of the fame iHuftriows chief
who before led them to vi&ory and glory,
and who, if the occaQon (hould require it,
could not hesitate to obey the summons of
his country âwhat a striking and encourag
ing contrail doe* this situation in many re
fpedts present, to that in which we defied
the thunder of Britain ? what is there in it
to excufc or palliate the cowardice and base
ness of a tame surrender of our rights to
France ?
The question is unnece(fary. The peo
ple of America are neither idiots nordaftards.
They did not break one yoke to put on ano
ther. Though a portion of them have been
hitherto misled ; yet not even these, still less
the great body of the nation, cas be long
unaware c>t the true situation, or blind to
the treacherous arts by which they are at
tempted to be hood winked. The unfaith
ful and guilty leaders of 3 foreign facliou,
unmalked in all their rntrinfic deformity,
mull quickly (hrinkfrom the scene, appall
ed and qonfounded. The virtuous wham
they have led aflray will renounce their ex
otic -standard. Honest men of all parties
will unite to maintain and defend the honor
and the sovereignty of their country.
The crisis demands it. 'Tis folly to.dif
fetnble. The despots of Franco arc waging
. war against us. . Intoxicated with success
| and the inordinate of powerj they vir
tually threaten our independence. All ami
cable means baÂ»ein vain been tried towards
accomodation. The problem now to be
solved is whether We will maintain or surren
der our sovereignty. To maintain it with
firmnef* is the mod sacred of duties, the
the moll glorious ps talks. The happiness
of our country, the honor of the Ameri
can name demands it. The genius of In
dependence, exhorts to it. The secret
mour'niug voice of oppressed millions in the
very country whose despots menace us, ad
monish to it by their fuffering example. The
offended dignity of man commands us not
to be acceflary to its further degradation.â
Reverenee to the Supreme Governor of
the umverle enjoins us not to bow the knee
to the nsodern Titans* who crcft their im
"pious crests againfl him and vainly imagine
they can subvert his eternal throne.
But 'tis not enough to resist. 'Tis requi
fitc to resist with energy. That will be a
narrow view of our foliation which dues not j
contemplate, that we may be called, at our!
very doors to defend our independence and.
liberty, and which does not provide against
it, by bringing into activity and complete'y
organising all the resources of our country.
A rcfpe&able force, ought to proud
our commerce, and a refpe&able army ought
both to diminilh the temptation to invalion,
by lefTening the apparent chance of fuccels,
and to guarantee us, not only against the fi
n:il fucctfs of fueh an attempt, but ag.iinfl â¢
the serious though partial calamities, which '
in that cafe \yould certainly await us, if we j
have to rely on militia alone against the en-1
terprifes of veteran troops, drenched in ;
blood and (laughter and led by a (kiltul and
daring chief !

HOUfcE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
WEDNESDAY APRIL 4.
The bill authorising an expenditure, and
making an appropriation for the reimburse
ment of money advanced by the Consuls of
the United States in foreign countries, was
read the third time and palled.
Mr. Livingfton reported a bill declaring
the aflent of Congress to two afts of the
state of North-Carolina therein mentioned,
which was twice read and committed.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
claims, made a report on the petition of Jo
fiah Green, who prays for an increase of his
peufion, and that it may be paid in future
in the state Â«f Pennsylvania, instead of New-
York. The report dates, that no legisla
tive interference is neceflary in the latter cafe
and that it is not expedient to grant the for
mer- Concurred'lS.
Mr. Sitgreaves presented the petition of
John Vaughan, of this city, merchant, fta
tingÂ»-that he lodged a quantity of silver bul
lion in the mint, between the firft of Janu
ary and the 21ft of November, j 795, for
which he received a warrant for 230,888
ounces of sterling fiJverr, which was issued
upon the report ot the then Allayer of the
mint, whose afiays were calculated at the
rate of nine parts fine to one part of alloy,
and not at the rate of 1485 fine to 1.79 al
loy, as the Jaw requires, by which devia
tion from the law, he has fufFered a loss of
2,260 dollars, and on which account he
prays relief.
Mr. Sitgreaves moved to refer this peti
tion to a feledt committee ; but this course
being objected to by Mr. Macon who said
it properly came under the business of the
committee of claims, it wa3 referred to that
committee.
Mr* Otis proposed a resolution to the
house, calling upon the Secretary of the
Treasury for a statement of the (hipping be
longing to the different diftri&s of the U
nited States ; when,
Mr. Gallatin observing that it would be
best to adopt a similar resolution to the one
formerly agreed upon, including foreign, as
well as domestic (hipping, the following was
agreed to :
Refolded, That the Secretary oj the Trea
sury be dircded to lay before the house, aJlate
ment, *txhihiling the tonnage of shipping belong
ing to thefeveral d'lJlriSi of the United States,
at the laji periodJtr which an account can be
prepared, di/lingui/hing the regijlered from the
enrolled and licenced tonnage ; also, a compar
ative Jlatement of the tonnage of vessels employ
ed in the trade between the United States
Foreign Countries, from Jan. lfl, I 795, to
the latejlperiod at which an account can be made
up, dijlingu/hing the foreign from the domeflic
tonnage."
Mr. Kittera wished the house to take up
the bill'which he reported 011 Monday, ref
pefting authorizing certain officers to ad
minister oaths.
Mr. Allen hoped the galleries would be
cleared, in order that they might again go
into the consideration of the confidential

Mr. Gallatin supposed as that business
would not occupy much time, it would be
best deferred till the close of the fitting, and
in the mean time go on with other business.
Mr. Allen said, he wifiied to take up the
confidential business, as he supposed the pa
pers would be made public, and he was de
sirous that it (hould be decided upon as-ear
ly as possible.
Mr. Gallatin said, it that was the gen

The galleries were cleared accordingly ;
and the whole of the fitting was occupied
w'th this buGnefsi, We have not learnt that
any rote was taken with refpeft to the

NEW-YORK, April 2.
From Lausanne we learnthaton the ictli
of January, the green flag was displayed at
the house where the committee iff Union
were aflembled, with this infeription, " The

the color of William Tell, and other Swiss
patriots.âAll the citizens decorated them
selves with the green cockade. The armed

plant Liberty poles on the square St. Fran
cois, am. V.i the tnoft vivid acclamations of
"lo.ng I ivc liberty ""long live the Alemaanic
Republic."
GeuerahWeis is preparing to defend jhe
Swiss territory,' and General Medart is col

ztrland at least with Berne,feems inevitable ,
This necefTatily with involve the whole Hel

dissolved it.
The important crisis of Europe has deter
mined the court of Denmark to iflue orders
to the military commander in chief to recruit
with aftivity and to augment the number
of thofc employed in the artillery, and to
complete the corps of Chaffeursâlt is sup
posed these troops are destined to preserve
the neutrality of Denmark and hi?r pofTef

also reported that twelve fiiips will be put

The French papers announce that an
open animosity already exists between the

DEMOCRATIC BIOGRAPHY.
A question has often been askedâWho
is Giles ? I'll fatisfy the curiosity, because
it is right to know his origin, in older to
leflen attachment to his French fyftetn.
Farmer Giles is descended from the lowest
grade of Gentlemen in the ancient dominion.
His father was overseer of Mr. Berkely's
negroes ; arid being acute in his duty, sav
ed some money, by a ptofeflion mean in its
calling ajid cruel in its nature. Still, how
ever; Giles's father was too sensible not to
deplore his own want of learning, and was
determined that his son should benefit by
his afiidurty in the field. He gave the boy
a latin education, and in due time placed
him to the study of the law. .Thus endow
Â«d with latin and law,.young Giles Joon
became tolerably fsjinent in his profeffion.
But unfortunately the genius of the lad
had a bias also to gaming ; and hence no
sooner were the courts over, than away
flew Giles to the bowling green, card table
and horse racingâBut above all, .his great
and amiable penchant was to the infamous
faro tabje. Giles has lately taken up the
family calling, and by marriage, a flumes
the oversight of 500 /lavesâhence his pro
pensity to black guarding arises from his own
and from his father's negro-occupationâ
and henc- by the rule of contraries, he is
'so superlative a friend to liberty qnd equali
ty âand an
" Adorer of the Peopleâ¢"

I fee in boith Brdwn and Fenno'e papers
of Saturday, a note explaining your aflferti
on in the debate of Thursday last, " that
â¢' the treaties of Pilnitz and Pavia were
" contemptible forgeries by this note
you confiue the aflertion tcf the second trea
ty of Pilnitz alone, and abandon what you
had declared of the firft treaty formed inthat
city, and by your silence, I suppose you a
bandon what you said Â®f the treaty of Pa
via. Inowaffc you what evidence youhavein
proof of the second treaty being any more
a forgery than the others ? these treaties
were all brought to light by the fame means
and communicated to the world through the
fame channel, if that be good authority for
the treaty of Pavia, and the firft of Pilnitz,
why is it not for the other? If you have a
ny evidence to the contrary, I wish you
would refer me to it, in order that I may
come to a jHft conclusion.
From the Aurora of this day.
MR. BACHE, ' â¢
Mr. Harper did not aflert in his speech
yesterday that the treaties of Pavia arid
Pilnitz were forgeries. He aflerted that
the treaty of' Pavia was a forgery, and also
the paper called the second treaty of Pilnitz
and which fpeakssf a partition of France.
It is not for me to fay on what ground Mr.
Harper affirmed these papers to be forgeries;
but I can fay that they are weH known 10.
be so, having been fabricated by the Brif
fotin faflion, In order to inflame the people
of France against the Emperor, when that
faftion had resolved to declare war against
him for the purposes which are fully difolof
ed in their own writings. For the truth of
liis position Mi. Harper might have appeal
ed to the writings of Burke, of Calonne.
Â®f Mallet du Pan, of Gifford, and
who have never beeH conttadifted, and to
the speeches in the Briti/h parliament in fa
vor of adminiftratitih, which even lord Lanf
,downe and the opposition did not deny. He
did appeal to the knowledge of every well
informed man now io Europe, and of every
man in this country who had heard any
thing on French affairs more than the pa
pers contained in Deblrett's colleftien, ai.d
some harangues pronounced in the French
convention.
I As to the firft treaty of Pilnitz, about
which so much has been said, and so little
. understood, it merely a-eonditjorial and
| definitive agreement betweeri.tlje' Emjiercr
I and the king of PrulEa, that if either of
! their dominions, or any part of the empire
should be attacked by France, they would
unite in their defence, and would moreover
protest the king of France from personal
violence. They did not arm in support of
4 this convention ; and upon appearance of a
more secure and peaceable state bf things in
I France when the king accepted the new
j constitution, they fufpeuded the convention
by a public declaration. This is the utter
most which France and her pa. tizans rÃjhig'
and other countries, call a " cbmbination of
despots against the liberties of mankind, 1 '
As to the conductors of thÂ«' lFi^cK.re
volution being' a jjprcrl of miserable scoun
drels' Mr. Harper did'not fay fa. He said
f that he had diitovered the French revolu
tion to have been qontrived and brought a
bout by a a set of ambitiotti and unprinci
pled demagogues, ftrivirig fur power ; a set
of moon-struck philosophers, pursuing vi
sionary schemes; and a set of contemptible
fcoundreh, in pursuit of plunder - ' lii this
opinion I believe him to be correft ; and
those who are acquainted with the aitors in
this bloody drama will find no difficulty in
classing them accordingly. They will pro
bably place d'Orleans and his yuivy counsel
lor Mirabeau at the head ot the firft cl*fs,
with Talleyrand Perigord, Sityes, La Fay
ette, Robefpicrre, and the Lameths for ad
jutants. Rochifoucault, Clermont, Too
nere, Liancourt, Condorce, &c.
at the head of the second, and Dailton,

FELLOE'CITIZENS /
I have considered in detail the various rights,
powers and of the several branches of our
government relative to the immediate objefi of
my efTays, and hive endeavoured to prove that
the beauty, the order, the harmony and the
utility of the <wbole system efllntially depends
upon the diflindl, the faithful, and the unenâ¢-
crouching exercise of their refpeilive authorities.
I have considered also the nature of appropria
tions, that they are limited in.their nature, con
fined in their obje<sls, and do not involve in
their exercise, that unlimited discretion, that
monftrotis prerogative, that boundless authority,
more dangerous than the Star Chamber, more
sbfolute than a papal conclave, a Turkiih Bi
van, or a " National AJpmbly."
If precedent could be, addueed in support of
this do<striÂ»e, surrounded with all the majesty
ot antiquity, and the weight of uninterrupted
usage, still I would repel a praftice so perni
cious, so fatal to liberty and to orgahi/ed go
vernment. But I have afierted that lam pre
pared to prove, that this attempt is noveltn the
history of this country and of every other bat'
anced government. Great-Britain has exhibit
ed, if not the heft, certainly the molt stable gov
ernment in which a balance, or division .of pow
er has been attempted. From the annals
therefore of her legislature, one might cxpedt
to ch aw the precedents of such a, claim or pre
ttnfion. Her constitution, founded only on me
mory, and the variable and perilhable records
of parliamentary decisions, has been guarded
with more caution than the Hefpefian fruit.
Her parliament, pofiefling within itfelf, all the
talents, and almost all the ambition of
the nation, has maintained with inflexi
ble perseverance its rights and its privileges, if
there be a fubjeil pre-eminently iutekfrts
the ztfal and excites the jealoujy of the house of
commons, it is the power to hold tlflS " PURSE
STRINGS" of the nation. It is the rightie
unlock the NationalJlrong box.
But can Mr. Gallatin, or Mr. Nicholas, point
us to the example of the house of commons hav
ing exercised, or claimed a power like the one
contended for fey them ? Have THEY ever at
tempted ta Jlarve the judges of the court of
King's bench .' Or have they fubje&td their
foreign miniftere to disgrace and penury, b
withholding theirpromifed renvard and necefla
ry support ? H.ns THEIR minority as virulent
and as daring as any but our own, ever attempt
ed to " flop the wheels cf government," by re
fufing afient to ordinary appropriations ?
" Ourfciends" and Mr. Gallatin's country
men the French, have lately made an ejpxy -afon
a " checked and balanced" government. To
be lure, they have proved that they, do not re
gard the " checks" of their constitution, and arc
not very sedulous to preserve the " balance" at
it; hut still tiiev keep up the exterior pagean
try of forms. Do we find the c'ouucil of five
hundred rafufc to pay the clerks or secretary of
the diredWy ? Do we hear of their Itrikin:;
out the pay and salary of ministers, because
they do not like their printiptys, or because they
are too numerous and increal'e tUe " patrtaa^e"
of the dire&ory ? I am aware that it will be
said that the cases are not perfectly analogous,
that there the directory are the strongest, and
would bar.ifh the members if they should piss
sny offenfive refoltuions, but that in this country,
the greate/1 power resides in the lower branch
of the legislature.
i his obje&ion is solid, I therefore pa/'p to the
consideration of ear praftice, in the several slates
at well as in Congress.
In the conftruiSlmn of all public as well as
private ctmpaSs, the most natural, certainly the
faireft and nuift proper rule, is to aim at the
discovery of the objelils aod intentions of- the
contracting parties âln determining ou tire
meaning of the constitution ef the United
Stares, it ii certainly correcft to ascertain and
prafliee under similar constitutions of th* state
goÂ«rnment?. J .

<*f the 'railing of dogs, brcaufe it

MR. DUNNING,
Being a farmer, and not very well ac
quainted with public affairs, I would wish
to be informad on certain points. And as
I am not much of a writer, I would put
feme querys, and beg fotne judicipus man
would give me an answer.
1. Are our members of Congress men of
chara dfer for integrity and htnefly, or were
they chosen by rogues for their Knavery ?
2. Have they the fame interest in the
fafety and prosperity of our country as we
have in general; If the country thrives, wilf
it J)c for the benefit of themielves, their
families and friends, and if the country
(hould become poor or go to war, will it be
of any'difadvantagcto them, their families
and friends ?
3. Will their being chofea by the peo
ple once jn two years be likely to have any
influence on them to pursue the good of the
country ?Is it likely that they will, get as
much by honeflly doing their djity, as by
roguishly violating it ?
4. Are our members of Congress men of
information ; and particularly on politics ?
â  5. Have they as good means of know
ledge, as the writers in our news-papers at
home by the si re fide ?
Now Mr, Dunning, Idoti'Â» profefs to
know but little, but, if our members of
congress are men of integrity and of infor
matio'nâif their interest and mine is 'the
fameâif they can't bWng on a war or lay a
burdan on the country, without burdening
and hurting themfelvcs, their friends ana
families as ws;ll as me, âif they are likely to
get as much by bonejly as by roguery,âif
they are well informed and have as good or
better mean* of knowledge than onr writers
for the prints, I cannot fee why some peo
ple should be so much against them. May
hap, fir, they vote so clearly of the wremg
fide, that every body fees they are wrong
and difhonefl, for if they are not difhonefl, a
man may think they are wrong, because he
himfelf wants knowledge of fadls, or skill
in judgment. But .1 have often heard it
said, that politics are so uncertain, where all
the fails are kuovvn, that people will never
think alike,' and that wife men iriSy well be
of a different opinion. If but half the fads
aie known, it will be clearer still, that wife
men may dtffer, and I have often thought
(but mayhap it was a foolilh thought) that
in the country we don't know every faâ¬t a
bfout political measures, to a right judg
ements And though it is right for men to
think and taik for themfeHes, is it not e-'
qually right to think and-talk modestly, and
not to be too confident in our opinions ?-
Must we not fir, put ouetruft in men ? And
where (hall we find men mOre honest and
better informed, than our present members
of congress ?
Perhaps, it is the fenditig'men to Congress
that changes therti from lloncft men of sense
to regpes of sense, or without ffcrtfe, and if
so, we had better keep our good men at
home, & not ftnd them there to be fpoiled'.
Lj men mti/l not trnjl men, who shall we trust
(hall we trust the printers ? But they disagree
so mueh that one fays a thing is white and
the other fays it is black. Shall we .trust
Speculators, who always make a noifc to have
measures taken, that will raise the price of
their L<and, or to prevent its falling ? Shall
we trust Englifhmeti, Frenchmen, Irilhmen,
rather than ourown country folks? shall we
trust those naen, who wish that they or their
friends may go to Congress ? shall we trust
discontented, turbulent men, or men that
hnve not much morality or much sense*?
The weak answer I should give would be,
trust our own Countrymen of reputation for
Â«wr >fcuag.ijn <Â»<'>' %
honejly, goodjenfe and means of knozuiedge.
Who are tb*y ?
raan will show them to me, I will
be obliged to him. Bufc if he cant CtOi+ me
' men of better character for honcfty, and
fenfe andinfoj-mation than ourprefent mem
bers of cQiigrels,âl don't fee what he will
get by his show.
So if he don't show me, that those who
call therafelves republicans, are more honest
men, and better informed, than those who
are called friends of Government, I dosbt
whether it is troith my mhile to change
my creed at this time of day.
A FARMER.
; P. S. What is the reason ; Mr. Dunn
' ing, that the prints are so full of pieces in
the fpriÃg and fall ? Are men know
ing then tbau at other
ousfor public good, oris it then, that fly,
artful men ttndeavour toraiftf a fto'rm, that
Ithey and their friends may be chosen to of

Onhis fever burnt bpi), quiet pafpirip for breath,
Lay riji phon, corivull'ed with pain,.
While the wind 111 his throat (hook the rattle
, j of death,
r | .y,he hot blood rag'd through thi fwoln vein .
Large drtvps of cold sweat on his forehead (lid
stand,
luftre wasMim'd in his eye ;
While the chill of his feet,& thi chill of his hand,
Pronotinc'd that poor S ret Hon mult die.
His all wej;t, & his kindred allcried,
Wjth handkerchiefs.held to ea'-h eye,
While a boy and a girlfcbb'd aloud at each file,
I j t Tf think that their father mnft die.
But who can describe the fond griefs of his wife,
Her (hriekinps, her tears and despair,
Whin she vow'd that fame hour (houlil end her
own life, -
And tore offby handfulsher hair.
Oh death 1 thou fell monfter,in angui&fhe rav'd,
Ob spare my dear huiband, Oil fyare; '
Throw thy,-cedartatnie,let myhuiban'd befav'd,
Or I fink in a whirl of despair.
Oh how shall I live, when my husband is dead,
Or why this loath'd life should I save,
Then hafte,we!comedeath, &takemeinhisftead,
Or I'll go with my love to the grave.
[The wind whiftl'd high, the old mansion about,
And rock'd like a cradle the floor,
When death in the entry fUod knocking without,
With his knuckle of bone on the door.
And he burfted the lock, and the dooropen'd
wide,
And in the slim fpeflre flow strode, *-â¢
And he rattl'd his jaws and he rattl'd his fide,
As ovsr the threshold he trod.
Whose here, cried the fpeflre, who calls loud
forme,
Who wants death ? the thin fpecftrethen said;
Why, who? cried the wife, why, who should
it be ?
But the gentleman there on the bed.
The Legislature of this State have ad
journed fine die.

PROPOSAL, ;
For Publijbing by Subfcripjion,
AN ]
â¢ EN I R Y
INTO THE
ORIG 11} OF EPIDEMIC DISEASES.
THE Letters ta Dr. Currie, which 1 ptblifhed
last autumn, led me to an invefligation of
I, the origin and pheaomena of peftilantial
in other countries, as well as in the United St tes.
In the profrcutioo of the fubjeS, new fails and
principles continually opened to my view, and fi
nally determined me to trace back the history df
such diseases as far as the records of hiflory ex
tend. For this purpose, I have examined theptib
, lie libraries- in New-York, Ntw-Haven, Cam
a. briilge and Boflon, with a visw to obtain ail the
material faft> which can illustrate the fubjsfl.and
1 have nearly colle&ed all the materials for the
prOposed work.
The la<SU eell cled will enable me to demon
strate that many of the common idraÂ« refpedting
peflilential epidemics, are unfounded or extremÂ«-
ly incorreA ; and this in consequence of medical
| writers cenfideriag an epidemic disease as a detach
-0 e:l or isolated phenomenon in a particular Colin
try ; rather thau as conne&ed with other epi 'e
at nÂ»ics or other phenomena of nature in various
â¢e, part" of the world. The fa&s I have collcifted
:re lead to certain dedoiftions which are furprifingto
if, myteli, and which will probably be new to many
ri other's. Much light will he thrown on this dark
it" and p rplexing as well as an natural phi
losophy.
The proposed work will make a full-fized oÂ£la
â vo volume ; and executed well on fine paper, caÃ
not he afforded at lels than two dollars, bound,
with the usual allowance to book-fellers, - s the
"" compilation will cod net only great labor,but con->
fifUrablc experee., no more copies will be printed
â  e than to i\pply fubferibers. The book will be ieÂ»-
' dy for fubferibers early itlthe coming summer, and
the holders of proposals will be good Â«rf ugh to
return them to No. 40, Pine-street, by the fir ft of

THE Subscriber, proposing to contra& his busi
ness, offers this Eihte for falc, on moderate
terms. On it are one Blast and three Air Furnaces,
a complete Boreing Machine* and a very good grift
Mill, with two pair of stones ; alio a good Forge, all
in perfect repair,as air ail t lie Wster Works conneft
ed wirh these various branches. The Air Furnace#
were lately built for the purpose ot calling Cannon
for this State.âThere are abou two thousand acres
of Land, one half of which is under wood, the other
very fine arable Land, producing the best Hay and
Pasture. The Cannon lately mannfaft wred there,
fully proves the excellency of the metal, which is
(uperior to any in this country, and probably, equal
to any in the world ; for not one of sixty- nine guns
lately made, although some of the 24 were bored
into 32 pounders, have failed on proving. The situ
ation s very eligible, particularly for this brana* of
manufacture, a*d a place of arms lying in the Wate
of Connedlicut. and only 30 miles from several land*
ings on the Hudson's river, and having every advan
tage that can rcfult from a plenty of water issuing
from a large natural pond, very near the Furnace,
and which may be converted into a variety of other
ufeful purposes. The purchaser can be accommodat
ed with all the stock anci utenfi's, and have poffefiion
on er before the ftrft of June next, and preparation
may be made in the meantime for going into Blast im
mediately thereafter, for every part will be delivered
in good order, with forae coal, Ore, Stc. &c. For
termi, apply to Mr. Joseph Anthony, in Philadel
phia; David Brooks, Ef'q. one of the Reprefenpfeives
in Corgrefs for this State ; Mr, &avid Waterman, on
