Sett. 6. Tnat the Jum often thousand dollars
be, and hereby is appropriated, for the purpose
of enabling the Prejident of the United States tt
carry into effect the provisions of this ad; and
that the said sum be paid tut of any monies in the
Treasury not otheruvife appropriated.
Mr, Milledce moved to strike out the
words â¢' or under," in the last line but one of
the firft feftion, as no per/on lwd any legal
claim upon any part of that territory, and the
retaining them would seem to fanttion claims
which had been declared not to exilj, and
would be oft'enftve to the state of Georgia.â
Two dift'erent claims had been pretended, but
they had been declared by- the.Xegi/lature to
be null and void, and he, -a# a reprcfentative
of that state, declared there was no claim up
on it.
Mr. Hamper, wasoppofed to Stilting out
tliefe words. Whether the claim;, of certain
individuals upon this territory were well or
ill founded, was not now the qneltion, their
validity muftbe detcrmiiieAia a'Court of Juf>-
tice. That there did exist cla.ms, in which a
great number of persona were interelled, was
well known j and the question was whether,
when the United Stateswere about to make an
amicable settlement with the state of Georgia,
it would not be good policy to hold out also
an accommodation with those persons. Nor
could he believe that the of Georgia 1
could take offence at this. The United States
come forward to the state of Georgia, and fay
you have a claim to a large territory, to part
of which we lay claim, to other parts we have
none, but we know that certain individuals
have claims upon it. It is the defue of the
United Slates to put an end tp this dil'pute.â
I Should we agree with you for the Cession of
this territory, Â»pd be placedui yourlituatioi,
then we shall l>ave on our hands the litigation
with the persons who claim upon you, and
will fettle thie buliuefs with them as well as
we can. he said, could have no other
appearance than that the Government of the
UnitedStateswere deflrous of accommodating
a difference which might not otherwise beea
fily fettled. A negociation would, of course,
take place betwixt the United ttates and
Georgia. That state Could not be expetted
to cede this territory without an adequate
compertfation, and when they had obtained
this, t>ur fettling any difference with persons
whs lay claim to a part of this territory, could
tvot affect that state, and the retaining of these
words would fliew to tin persons claiming,
that though the United States would not al
low their claim, they were willing to refer it
to amicable settlement. A very powerful part
of Georgia, said he, are interested in 'these
claims. SÂ«les have been made, or alledged
to be made, to a nuinberof co-.iipanies, which
included a great variety of characters and iri
terefts, conliderable for their number and for
the.r activity. How will this clause operate
upon that class of men i The state of Geor
gia, we know, has 4Â«n:ed their They
lay tiie irt by whith tlii fttle Was made Wal
ebtaincdby fraud, and was voconftitutional.
These men, therefore, hive no hop? whilx
Georgia pofTclTes this territory j but if tlÂ»<
Uoitsdtjiattfs bold o.at in ibis ait the idea cf
an amicable fculeroeot witfcthem, would they
â¢oi be enhfted in behalf ol the ccHion ; and

Mr. Ven ABLE was'in favour of the amend.-
ment. It was as much greater important*
than tlfc yentleniaii tiom South Carolina feeui
ed to tfcinkit. He asked Ã¼bfeiher gentlcmefr

half million of dÂ»lljus which they had paid,
for the Uud, cfiufing rattier to rjlk the w,Uole
than give up their claim, it nuy be expected
thev willbe hit,U iji.theii demands. Believing
that fJltfc words were introduced with a V '*J*
of inctcmn fyitig the lands;
he thought it important thiCt tliff> Ihould 09

1 if not good at present, it ought never to bo
j good. He hoped, therefore, the amendment
would obtain.
Mr. Nicholas could scarcely believe that
there could bÂ« a feriou* intention in any part
of the eommittee to give the propoleu po'.vef
' to the Coinmilliouer s to be appoiuteu utluer
this law, via, to bind the Unttcil ataics to any
amount, not only to the ttate of Georgia, but
to individual claimants 011 this territory. Ana
is it, said he, a bulinetsot this magnitude that
engages lo Little the attention ol the commit
tee i It this was the object of the bill, it was
one of the molt important quettions upon
which he had ever been called to act; but he
could scarcely think the lubjeCt could be ot
such magnitude, when f.c recollected
the gentleman from South Carolina had Hated
was the advantage to be derived to the United
States from entering into this engagementâit
was that thete perfous would ule their influ
ence with the ttatc of Georgia to nuke thÂ«
surrender. It was a little remaikable that tor
r f 0 little, the gentleman ihoifld be inclined to
give so much, indeed, uiltead 01 this gaining
' any advantage to the United States, the gen
tleman from Georgia had ltated mat even to
â¢ glance at theft claims would be ortenlive to
that state. Before this pÂ»wer was given to
' the Commifiioners, the;- committee ought to
be ready to appropriate at lealt a million ot
dollars for the pur pole. He thought it would
' be vsry imprudent ta embark in any such
(peculation, and thereby pledge themlelves to
1 provide money to any amount which it may
r please these Commiluenery to itipulate for.â
We have, (aid lie, land enough already, and
r need not purchase more ; elpecially as we finti
a flow sale for what we have. It Uiejunldic
tion was wanted, let it be Itipulated lor.iepa
rately, and not think ot fco.ng to purctiale an
1 immense territory, one half ot which n e havÂ«
a claim to already, whillt we have several
millions of acres n.ore than we know w hat tf
do with.
Mr. Millepce laid it the wish of th*
people of Georgia that a ceilion of the domi
nion and foil of this territory should be made
to the United States, and the iLegifidturc of
that state are ready to meet the United States
on the business; but if thelc words were re
tained they would prove an obltacle in the
way of the cellion 01 either the territory or ju
rifaiction, as the.Legjflatiire were determined
to set their face against thele pretended pur
chasers. indeed ttvo ot the individual pur
chasers are now contelting with, each other;
and therefore for the United States to inter
fere, would only be to involve thetn in diffi
culties and law-f'uits; for the purchase is not
only-denied by the Hate of Georgia, but tiiÂ«
individual purchasers theuifelves are denying
to each other the legality of their purchales.
Mr. Baldwin laid, the committee would
recollett the manner in which this fubjett
came under conlideration, by means of the
McfTage from tlie President, who recommend
ed that. the right of foil and jurisdiction of
this te/iitory should be obtained,and when this
1 was done, that the United States ought to
1 establish a temporary government thert. No
notice was taken by Ilim of any interfering
claims. The present motion was intended,
and, he thought it best to confine their atten
tion, to the objeits recommended by tiie Pre
fidont. The other queftioii would of course
. be left open. If the United States meant to
go back to all the rights of the Natchez coun
try, they might go back to the right of Great
Britain, afterwards to that of Spain, and ps
different companies of individuals. He tho't
jt belt to confine the objett of the bill. When
a temporary government is effablifhed, and
an amicable adjuflment has taken place be
twixt the United States and Georgia, it wilj
then remain a question with the United State*,
whether it will be belt to little the interfei !
ing claims by a general power given to Com,
miflioners, or to leave them to be fettled by
the judicial power. He hoped, therÂ«forr,
the words would be struck out.
Mr. Harper fully concurred in
with gentlemen that the other objefts of tho
bill were moreimportant to beobuined than
the object which these words were intendÂ« 4
to obtain. A ceflion of the right of jnrifdic
tion alone would be desirable, if no other
ceflioYcould be obtained, as such a cetfion.
and the efUblifamem of a temporary {jovern
ment, would remove Â»tl the Icrious difficul.
tie* now experienced ; but notwithfianditur
this, he believed the bill would be better as
it (lands than with the wards struck out. ,T'"s
was, however, mere matter ot op'nion," at.d
if the amendment was carried, he should still
bÂ« J" the bit!.. If the amendment
\VM.umÂ£ XHI.- vie rights of thqfe \Tho
claimed part <ff this territory would bc asfirm
i.mVr :hc United Sta'm, they are now un
der Georgia* and we {Hall afterwards be at
liberty to make\n accommodation with them
But he th-jugbt it *'ould be bed now to
the by coonefting the two objeCls
together. As 10 the fears of the-gentleman
trom Virginia, with respeCt to the extent of
this bill, and as to the abuse which might be
made of the power placed in the President and
Commissioners, the fame abufs might take
place, it this amendment was carried. T hey
might then agree to give the state of Georgia
ten miTÃons of dollars by treaty, for the ter
ritory in question. But because the power
might be abused, that could not be admitted
as an argument sgainft giving it. Could it
We fuppoXed that the owners of this land were
fucn favotiritcl of the Executive that they
will agree to give them a very extravagant
price tor property which we can do without}
He thought no fear was necefTary on this head,
aathe President would be fcnfible such a Itep
would excite general cenfnre. But was there
bo other way of fettling these claims, but by
paying large sums of "money ? He conceived
there was,'and that they might beadjultedby
a division of the land, as there could be no
doubt these persons would be gladtorelinquifh
one-half or twq-thirds of the country for an
â¢ndifputed title to the reft. But the gentle
man from Virginia seemed to think we had
Land enough, and that we made no advantage
tf that we have. He said he knew we liad
obtained 50,000 dollars from the lale-of our
land, and that individuals are Hill anxious to
purchase, though not at the price at which it
is fixed. But the United States are desirous
of getting pofTeflion of this territory, not so
much on account ot the value ot the land,
as for other purposes, and'particularly for the
establishment of agovernment at the Natchez.
He wished, therefore, to retain theie words.
After a few observations from Mr. i iND-
Ie y in favour of the amendment (which were
nut diftimftly heard) the question was taken
and carried, there being 59 votes in its favoua-
Mr. Nicholas was not fatisfied that the
President and these Commissioners (hould have
it in their power to pledge the United States
to pay any sum ef money they pleased. He
â¢Would confide as much in the present Presi
dent, as any other, but his opinion might
differ from the opinion of Congress as to the
value of this territory to the United States,
and >t would be parting with a power which
they ought to retain. He therefore moved to
add to the end of the firft feftion, " prwiJ'J
tbat tbcJaid -bp*- â '/**Â« mi et authorized
to bind the United States to pay any sum of money."
Mr. Harper apprehended the gentleman
from V .rginia tiiuft be in jest. Such a provi
sion would make the bill wholly nugatory,
as the Commiflioners would not bc able to
come to any contract with the state of Georgia.
H,e hoped the Commissioners, under the con
trol of the President, would be trusted to
tranfad this business, or if the President was
not to be trusted, somebody else ; but he did
not wiih three Commissioners to be lent to
Georgia with their fingers in their mouths.â
_Hvcould not conceive a more litigatory or
idle melfage.
Mr. MilleDOE hoped this amendment
would be rejected, as it would destroy the
intent of the bill, it'carried. The country to
be negociated for, he, is an amazing traCt
of country of lixty or feveuty millions ot acres
of land as valuable as anyin the world, which
the Hate of (j'eo'rgia could not be expefted to
fuirtnder, or to yield the jurisdiction of it,
witltout an equivalent. He hoped the Com
miflioners would be inverted with full powers.
Mr. N icti o LA s allured the gentleman from
/ S. Caroliua he was very serious in making his
a j^ndmcut; and if it would produce the ef
' feet itajed by hitu ami the. geinleman from
Georgia, he was ready to fay the bill onght to
be rejected. The gentlemaa from Georgia
had ftatcd rhat Congress were about to autho
rize Commissioners to purchase 60 or 70 mil
lion acres of the best land in the world. To
bind the United States to pay for a purchase
of this kind would be an aCt of mmlncfs.
Where wm the money to be got ? The Presi
dent may aCt with discretion, yet he may think
it his duty to give an equivalent for this land.
The gentleman from South Carolina seemed
not to mind where the power of aCting on this
bufii\efs was placed, so that it was not in the
the Houle of Representativesâwhere, accor
ding to that gentleman's opinion, power could ,
int be falely lodged. He trusted, however, 1
the committee roffeffed fufficient prudence !
not toaCt upon this bulinefs until they had it 1
niore clearly before them. 1
Mr. Gallatin observed, that the firft ;
seCtion of this bill had two ebjeCls; the firft 1
goes to rhe amicable settlement of limits, as to 1
that par! of this country to which the United 1
States 'lay claim. In this respeCt unlimited
power is given to the Comniiflioners and the 1
President. That part would not, therefore, 1
be affeCted by this amendment. Thenextob- c
ject goes to a relinqUifhment on the part of t
Georg aof the whole or any part of the terri- j
tory btitli as to jurisdiction and foil, to which *
tfie United States lvave no claim. Though it t
Jhay be good policy to obtain a ceflion of this c
part of the country, yet it is not immediately
necefTary, since the Commiflioners will be at i
liberty to treat fully as to that part of the
country to which the United States have a â¢
claim. The amendment only went to fay t<
that no contract which involved the payment f<
â of money should be valid, until sanCtioned by si
Congress. He thought this a proper provision. tl
This power of binding the United States to ti
the payment of money in this concern, is not p
refufed to the President from an idea th#t he >
will abuse the power, but because it is a bufi- v
ness which belongs to Congress, and not to
hini. As he has not theraifing and providing t
of money, he is not so good a judge as Con- ji
grefs of what can be spared for any object. All a
ceflions, Mr. G. laid, had hererofore t
made in this way ; those of Virginia and Con- t
neiticut under the old Government, and that f
â¢f North Carolina under the presentâall these 0
cellior.s w ere accepted by Congress ; yet these t
States did not decline to make their ceflions a
conditionally, nor would Georgia. He wished t
the bill to pais; but except it contained foine f
principle fimilarto this, he should vote agaiiut t
it.
Mr. Venasls proposed an amendment Â£
which he thought was better calculated for the
purpose intended than the one under confede
ration, which Mr. Nicholas would have con
sented to have admitted in place of his, but 1
it w asdeclared by the chair, not to be in order.
Mr. Harpei. explained what lie had said I
about truftingthe power of negociatingin dther i
hands than the Executive. The gentWman 1
front Pennsylvania, he said had difccvered
that the firft seCtion of the bill had two ob
jects. It had, but he believed that gentleman ?
had mistaken them both. The firft, he stated,
was to fettle the limits between the Uhited
States and Georgia, and of the gentle
men froom Virginia who had spoken on this
lubjeCt had repeated the fame expreflion.
Frqpt this, it would appear \liat the United
Sta'es have a cla m unoii that country which
the fiate of allows ; wliereas she does .
not,allow us to have a tingle inch of land in (
i , that state. Therefore, alt parts of fhe bill
i I went to the fame object, which >*M to o
I a cession ofthr territory, and jurifdiftron botn
t ! of what we claim, (and which the does iw
allo'v) and what we do uot claim , an
â¢ this V>Â»ld not bc obtained in any other way
s Thau by either giving Georgia a sum ot 1,10,11 >
i the ccftion, or by taking it by the ftrolig
r hand of force. This bill therefore, no more
: a bill for fettling iimiTs, than.u *! a bil \Â°*
t building fen frigates. <Mtr interfering claim
: would certainly be considered in the a J u
l mentof the price, though it was not alio wet
i by Georgia to exirt. "1 hat part to whkh we
have no claim, would, of courte, be fixed a
r higher rate, and the President may, or uia>
1 not agree to purchase it. The geni eina.t
I from P' lfylvania had dated, this w..s no neiv
â  doClnhr, m Congress had always confirmed
l the ceflions which had been made by the dit
t ferent States j but there was no need ot a con -
1 traCt in thole cessions, as they were all nude
, without price, as a (acrifice for the goo >
5 the Union. It was fatd that the CommiOion- |
e ers might do every thing but pay tne n lO '
' but this was every thing, and except fb'-y i
1 the power of complcating their bargain, >-
l would be no use in fending them.
j Mr. J.Williams supposed from the title
i of the bill, it was a bill for an amicable fet
-3 tlement of limits with Georgia j but, by
- observations of the gentleman from a. t-ai â¢
i lin,, it appeared it was to provide for the
e purchase of Georgia lands. He did not eel
i willing to go to purcliafe lands of any state,
r I fit were intended to fettle a difputc abcu
Â» boundary line, he should be in favour o i ,
t but he could not think of empowering torn
s millioners to purchase fiomillion acres.oflMd
-3 It was to be lamented, he said, that the
, of Georgia had not long ago made a cession ot
e that part of her territory to which the Unite
. States are entitled ; but now they tell us i
. we want land, we mult purchase it. He was
- not for doing this. If it was theirs, let them
: hold it. If jurisdiCtion of a part ofher tern
i tory was wanted for a provisional Government,
- he thought that State ought to corne forward
3 as others had done and make a cÂ«Mion ot it,
; without price. He had do objection to tie
i appointing Coinmiffiohers to enquire upon
t what terms the land could begot; but he
- would go no farther. He hoped t.ie antcnu
t ment would be agreed to.
: Mr. Da v ton the Speaker) rose to make
, an amendment which he hoped would be a
i greed to by the gentleman from Virginia in
> place of his, as it Would eftect his
/ lie thought be preferable to the one he had oi
i fcred. It was to niaka the latter part ot the
' firft seCtion, after the word " South Carolina,
i read, " and alfitlo receive any prtpofalsfor a re
lirtjujbmtnt n cejjiun of the luhile or any part oj
, the other territory claimed by the Jlate of Georgia,
i and out of the ordinary jurifdiflion thereoj. '
"I his ameadment was agreed to. â¢
Mr. Milledge moved to amend the 3d
1 seCtion of the bill, respeCting tlie erefting ot
i a temporary Government, by adding these
words, " As soon as the consent of the ftgjlamre
> of Georgia /ball be obtained."
Mr. Harper was opposed to this amend
ment, the cffeCt of which, he said, would be,
to make this government depend upon tlie
fettle inent of its litigation with Georgia be
fore a temporary government could be esta
blished at th? Natchez, where there are be
tween 4 and 5000 fouls, without government,
as it is supposed the Spaniards have withdrawn
themselves from rhe pods which they have so
long held there contrary to treaty, and these
people are at the dirtance of 600 miles from
the ordinary jurisdiCtion of the government*
of Georgia, which distance is a continued de
fart in which are several Nations of Indians.
It cannot be expe&ed, therefore, that the
state of Georgia will or can extend her go vern
ment thither. So that one of our most valu
able frontiers will- be left in an unprotected
and di/orderly dafe. The inhabitants have
sent forward a memorial praying for a govern
ment, and there fc the most TatisfaCtory
evidence-that a government is neceflary. Whe
ther they stall have one or not, ought not,
therefore, to depend upon the rtateof Georgia.
Mr. Nicholas said, it appeared to him
that this bill was contradictory in itfelf, as it
states, we will not impair the jurifdiCtiop of
Georgia, at the fame time that it proposes to
establish a government within her territory.
The gentleman from S. Carolina had shewn
that it would be very inconvenient for the
government of Georgia to hold thisjurifdicti
on ; but he supposed if the United States
sent a government there before they adjuded
their difference with Georgia, that state would
not look very cordially upon the ttanfaCtiae,
and it would of course embarrass that adjust
ment. He hoped the state of Georgia would
not be diverted of her territory by the strong
hand of power.
Mr. Dayton wished the committee weuld
rife, as was important a question to
be decided when there was scarcely a quorum
of members in the house. But he would fay,
I that cases might exist, which would not only
juftify the United States in establishing a go
vernment ill the quarter alluded to without
the consent of Georgia, but even within the
ordinary jurisdiCtion of a state.
The committee rose ; and upon leave be- ]
ing asked to fit again,
Mr. Gallatin hoped it would not be
given, as he wilhed the bill to be re-commit
ted to tire seleCt committee in order to obtain
some information which he understood was be
fore the Senate with respeCt to the title which
the Unitec States have to certain parts of the
territoiy in question ; as he wished before thev
proceeded toeltablifh a government at the
Natchez to know something as to the title
which they bad to it.
Mr. Harper thought there was no necessi
ty to recommit the bill to accomplish this ob
ject, as the gentleman might go to the Senate
and obtain the information he wished from
thence. He believed they had nothing more
than a copy of an extratt xhich he had him
felf taken of an official cojvy of a grant given
ot W ell Florida by the feritilX government in
the year 1770, which was the handsof
a gentleman of New-Yerk who Secretary
to the Governorâthe original of which he
supposed was in the office of Trade and Plan- 1
tation in London. ,
The question for leave to fit again was ne
gatived 43 to 36, and the bill was recommitted.

dominion, are the only arguments worthy of
the terrible and invincible regublic. It dis
dains an appeal, either to heaven or earth,
for the juilrefs of its canfe, and atbeifti
cally relies on its own irrefiftable prowels.â
How much further this scourge of nations,
will be permitted to extend itfclf, is not for
mortals to fay, however th*y may be con
vinced of its diabolical nature,
If pUfuc, nor earthquake break not Hcavcn't deflgn,

But the trade of Britain is highly prospe
rous, while that of France is nearly annihi
lated, and republicans it seems, like money
at well as their neighbors. The fafts can
not be denied, fuice they arc admitted by
themfelvei. But the remedy to be applied
for the evil, from a people who have talked
so much about peace and philanthropy, and
other fine things, would consist (one (hould
suppose) in an-endeavor to fupplaat their ri
vals bj* fuperier industry and ingenuity.â
And from the advantage of the institutions
to be derived fronj the unrivalled excellence
of their government, from their ioimenfe
population, and acknowledged talents for
invention, it cannot be doubted, but that
they would soon be an over-match for every
competitor. What then reÂ«aius, but at
once to make peace, " turn their swords in- j
to ploitgh-fliares, their spears into pruning
hooks," and tcf engage in the contest, like
si tends and brothers, relying for success, on
the fair means of industry and exertion.â
This at least, on the private fitale, and old
principles of jnftice, would be the legitimate
course. For what (hould we far of a bank
rupt; vho would burn a more fuceelsful
trader's house, in order to reduce him to the

they might then, start even ? Yet this is
preeifely the cnndu& of the Direftory, who
a(k, " Have you lillened to the miuifter of
Great Britain, who informs you with the
most infnlting ostentation, that the English
commerce is to that of France as 18 to 2 ;
that the imports and exports do not amount
in France to more than 400 millions ; and
that in England they amount to seven milli
ards French ! Have you a moment to lose in
baffling the calculations of -English avidity!*?
France has been obliged, (continue they)
to make a temporary facrifiee of her credit
to the success of the war. But now viflo
ry ought to repay its facrifices, and at the
fame time secure to it that portion of me
tallic wealth, and that rank which the ma

mark out to it among the commercial pow

And is it th 113,0 ye citizens of the world !
ye orators of the human rffee ! ye profeflors
of uriiverfal fraternity ! Is it thus, ye cajole
your admirers and imitators ? Is all your
kissing, your hugging and your embracing,
for the love of mankind, " shrunk tu. this
little measure" ? To a narrow and fordid af
tach merit to metallu -wealth, and a de.fire of
promoting the commercial interest of Fraace
and filling the pockets of her merchants ?
And to go to war about it, like a naughty
despot ! and to talk about fating the ambi
tion of your Republic, when you have so
often told us, there was no ambition but a
mong kings ! âWho could have believed it ?

On Wednrfday a female child of Mr.
Thomas Bartoii was ran over by a loaded'
waggon and expired almost injlantancoufly.
We have'juft received intelligence from
Harrilburgh, that John Hants and Charles
M'Manus have been convi'fted of the wilful
murderofMr. Frances Shit?, late ofShaef

nity of yorktown, being foracwhat in liquor
was led by his horse into the Codorus and
morning, the remains of a young infant were i
difesvered, supposed to have been thrown
in about tour days before.
Tfe?. rapid . approarrheS of vice and immo
rality in America, loudly demand the tnoft
energetic and effeftive measures to arrest
their progress. The lalt fifteen months has
aftually produced more murders, suicides,
robberies, &c than the whole feveu preced
ing years. The fad is certainâbut the
cause is, in some measure, unaccountable.
To ascertain it, and provide a remedy, is a
general duty ; and we trust the attention
of the differcndlegiflatures may lie fliortly
turned 011 so interesting a fubjedt to the
happiness of society.
Let what will be,the refulf we can not for
bear remarking, id, that the gencrel efta

Pennsylvania, that the remifllon of fines and
sentences, (hould be cautiaufly exercised :
for as, Shakefpearc fays,
" We ((ill give mis kiÂ«ffan<ftiÂ»n,

SIR,
. IT has been determined by the PreGdent
of the United States, that under present
circumstances, it has become iieccffary to
modify the inftruftion* iflueJ from this de
partment on the Bth day of April 1797, in
J t such manner as no longer to restrain vtffels
c Â°f the United Statfs from failing in an arm-
cd condition, when dcltined to be employed
if >n * regular and lawful commerce.
p _ B ut though you are to ccnfider the gen-
eral prohibition as no longer remaining in
force, it is the express command of the Pre
r fident, thgt you seize and detain all vefTels
refpefting which there may exist reafouable
ground of fufpicimi, that they are intended
to be employed contrary to law and partic-
ukirly to the aft of Congrefi pafled on the
n sth day of June, 1794, "titled "An aft
" in addition to the att for the punishment
" of certain crimes against the United
S " States," or the ad pasTed the 14th day
' of June 1797> entitled "An aft to prevmt
11 " citizens of the United States from pri
. " vateering against nations in amity with,
" or against citizens of the United States."
e Yen will also consider it to be your duty
? to prevent evasions of the aft passed on tilt
.* '4 th ' ia y of June 1797, entitled Â«' A-n ad
" prohibiting for a limited time the expor
" tation of arms and ammnniti'in, and for
" encouraging the importation thereof";
by confining the quantities of the said arti*
cles which niay be returned as conftitiiting
the equipment of ahy vessel, within reason
able limits.
e A confident reliapce is entertained, that
all your proceedings under these infiriKth'na
will be marked with decision and impartial
