from her was friendly, except in taking from

Nothing of any moment has taken place
lately, either at the Cape or Port de Paix.
Provisions were scarce and dear ; the British
fleet of eight fail of the line, and several fri

it was reported that an expedition was go

PHILADELPHIA,
WEDNESDAY EVENING, MAY 31.
The Comtniffioneri appointed uoder the
treaty with Great-Britain, proceeded, oh
Thursday lad, to choose the fifth Commif
fioncr by ballot, and the votetbeing between
Mr. Ames and Mr. Guilleitiard, the latter
was chosen.
Capt. Moore, of the Blip Genera! Wash
ington, arrived at this port frottt Madeira,
le f t there, April 25, the ship Eagle, Dales,
of Philadelphi a loading for Cadiz, and the
(hip Portfmo'.ith, Monk, to fail next day for
this port. Capt. Moore, on the 26th April,
fell in with a Britilh fleet of 4 (hips of the
line and 2 frigates, one of which, the Revo
lutionnaire, boarded him. The officer treat
ed capt. M. with the'greaieft politeness.
This fleet was under the orders of admiral
lord Hugh Seymour j and theoffieet wha
boarded capt. W. informed him that ano
ther squadron, undÂ«r admiral Nelson, was
cruifin/; off the Weflern Islands, for the
protection of the British and the Ameri
can commerce ; and that they had re-cap
tured a number of the vtffclsof the latter
fiwm the Freoch.
The "reporter" of the debates of
Congiefs in the Merchants Advertiser, has
been heard to fay, that he deduced the two
extra votes from the noes instead of the ayes,
because the Chairman was more certain of
his being right with refpeft to the ayes, hav
ing counted them twice over, than he was
with refpeft to the noes which he counted
but onceânor did the Chairman change his
opinion until a few minutes before the house
met yejlerday.
Some days ago the British Minister in
leaving the lobby of the House of Repre
sentatives was observed to touch Mr. Har
per, whose feat is near the door, and in a
moll familiar manner, reminded him of an
engagement to dinner the next day, This
was noticed by the Editor of the Aurora,
that watchful guardian of our political pu
rity, who was greatly and justly scandali
zed by this public appearance of good
, understanding between a Representative of
the People and a foreign agent. We ap
plaud this zeal ; and having heard it whif
peped that Mr. Harper has received an in
vitation to dinner from another British A
gent, the Consul General, we think our
selves bound to mention it, that it may not
escape the animadversions of our said guar
dian.
Indeed we do not wonder that our said
guardian (hould feel indignant at these open
attempts by British Agents to corrupt our
Representatives : Nor can we help in some
decree partaking of his indignation. As
however it is the manner of corruption
which gives him offence, and not the thing
itfelf, at least we suppose so from his known
impartiality, and his love of reciprocity,
we recommend it in future to the said
agents to manage the matter by means of a
fubfeription for three or four hundred copies
of some newspaper, and of nightly meet
ings at their houses. In this cafe it is pre
sumed, that neither the Editor of the Au
rora nor its partizans, can take offence.
Indeed the British have always been ve
ry bungling hands at corruption and in
trigue : These being among the number of
those accomplishments which they have ne
ver been able to acquire from their neigh
bours across the Channel.

COMMUNICATION.
At a time when it is fo'nectffary for the
fafety and independence of the United States
that the French government (hould be taught
that all the branches of our government arc
in union and that the people are resolved to
support their government, we find, on the
contrary, intriguing charafters, hostile to
our liberties, resorting to every expedient to
keep alive the hopes and expeftations of the
French tyrants. The efforts of some of the
minority in the Heufe of Representatives of
Congress,' cannot fail to Simulate the Direfto
ry to profecnte the plan of subjugation and
plunder.
Barras (in his infelent bombastic speech to
the meek and suppliant Monroe, who truly
teprefented, not the good people of America,
but a set of debased and crouching fatellitet,)
fays, that " France will not degrade heifelf
to calculate the consequences of the conde
scension of the American government to the
suggestions of its antient tyrants âon this
text, the official Redafteur, by order of the
Directory, in a paragraph written no doubt
by De4a Croix, fayi, " France will never
forget that, in fpitc of the most wicked in
iinuations, there palled only by a majority
of tnuo votes that fatal treaty, which has put
the Americans under the guardianship of the
Fnglifh." Attempts are now making by
French partizans, to pcrfundc France that
there is only a majority of two votel against
a propofuion, which has for its avowed ob
jefts the meanest acquiescence in the unpro
voked outrages of haughty France, and a
humble tender of advantage* to which (he
can have no just pretentions until (he hasof
fered an apctogy ftr her inrultt ai.J compensa
tion far her piracies.
If Franca can b* thus perfnaded that there
is within a few votes of a mejority of the Re
prefcntativu of the people, devoted to her
interests; with tlie Vice-Prefiieit'. at their i
head, cÂ»n it be any longer duub'eil that (lie |
will perfitt in attempting the fubvfriiou of I
oar conttiiU'.ion and the dcftiuttion of our
liberties! 1
E)etra3 of a Utter from a gentleman in Virgi
ilia to hit friend in this city. i
" The present appears to me to be a cril>6 ]
in the fortunes of jhe human race. France
evidently seeks to govern the world by plac- â 
in % power in the hands of men who will be i
subservient to her for the preservation of that
power. Thus Holland in the Form of a Re- |
public il, and mud be as obedient to France ;
as a French Province. That Government i
can only be preserved by the proteSion of t
France, and ihofe who govern can only keep \
their placet by the fame protection. So in lialy
you perceive a Republic or two is now form- i
ing. It is by no means impoflible that the i
Austrian dominions in Italy may be loft du- t
ring the present war and converted into one
or moie Republics. If the pecuniary aid of
Britain is withdrawn they mujl be lojl. These (
; Republics can only preserve their existence
j by the aid of France, and they will confe
qnently be er*irely under her controul. j
Should his dominions in Italy even be refto-
I ted to the Emperor, a French party will be
found there, which will not easily be extirpa
ted, and which will be ready in another war
to take up arms for France. It appears to,
me that an effort is making to govern the
whole world either by conquest or by placing
power in the hands of men who will ule it so
as topromote the views of France. The only
effort which haÂ« ever been mad<t in this conn
try by a foreign nation to influence our elec
tions and to place power in the hands of the
partizani of such foreign nation, hat been
made by France, and she has made it secretly
and openly. She has made it by the immediate
injlrumentality of her public agents, and by
that of American citizens devoted It her.
The fame plan which is incefTantly pursued
in Europe is pursued in America also. It is
to place power in the hands of these who are
indebted to France for it, or who will use it for
her aggrandizement. In Europe it is enough
to establish a republican foim efgovernment,,
in America it is nectjfary to do more. Pof.
! feffing already a Government purely Republi
\ con it is necefTary to calumniate it, to excite
jealoti/ies of the Republican dlfpofitions of those
who conduit it, and thereby to bring them into
disrepute with the People and by doing so to
fill all our departments with men who being
defied by a passion for France mud keep up
that passion to keep their places. The effort I
to universal dominion is plain and itsprogrefs '
is rapid. It seems to be impodible that the
French party in our country can be blind to
this danger. They must fee itâjet they
court it. They keep the people blind by talk
ing of a Briti/b influence which they know :
does not and cannot exifl. Of this the letter
ascribed to Mr. Jefferfon if really wtitten by 1
him, is a Itrong instance. 1 hope and have
heretofore believed, that he did not write it.
1 wait with eagernels for his denial of it. If
it jhall not be denied, I own that my opinion
of the moral charader of that gentleman, as
well as of bis polities will be much dimi/ii/hed."
To THOMAS JEFFERSON, Esq.
IT is now no longer a doubt that you are 1
the author of the abominable letter to Maz- (
zei, which haÂ« made so much noise rtkl fxci- 1
ted so much indignation throughout the U. I
States. '
Your silence, after being publicly and re- c
peatcdly called on by numbers of your fellow I
citizens to disavow it, is complete evidence Â£
of yqur guilt. Had you been innocent ef 1
the charge, all who know your keen fenfibi - '
bility at every thing which appears in print to > J
implicate your cooduA, and who have heard '
your profeflisDS of refpeft for public opinion . '
are fatitficd that yoa are fileiit, because you
dare not contradict it: Gonlidering you then
as the avowed author ef that indecent libel
agaioft the Government and chara&er of j
your country, I shall animadvett on it with 1
that freedom which the magnitude of the a
fubjeft requires. f
The effeds intended to be produced by you
in Europe are apparent from the writings of c
a French journalifl: ' Â£
The following comments are made on yÂ»ur t
precious letter in the r
PARIS MONITEUR : f
"The interesting letter from one of the F
molt virtuous and enlightend citizens of the 1
United States, explains the conduct or
the Americans in rfgard to Francs. n
It is certain that Â»fall the neutral and friend- r
ly powers, there is Rene from which France si
had a right to expert more interelt and sue- il
court than from the United States. She is G
their true mother country, fjnee she has as- jj
fured to them their liberty and independence.
Ungrateful children, inttead of abandoning
her, they ought to have armed in her de- p
fence. But if imperious circumdances had
prevented them from openly declaring far the
Republic of Fiance, they ought at least to a
have made demonstrations and excited appre-
henfions in England, that at some moment Â®
oi other, they would declare themselves ?
This fear alone would have been fufficient to a
foice the Cabinet of London to make peace. 0
It is clear that a war with the United States v
would flrike a terrible blow at the commerce f<
of the English, would give them unealinefs h
for the preservation of their pofTeflions on the *'
Amerisao Continent, and deprive them of
the- means of conquering the French and e
Dutch Colonies: o
Equally ungrateful ani impolitic, the Con- k
grefs hastens to encourage the English, that o
they might pursue in tranquility their war t'
of extermination against France, and to.in- "
vade the colonies and commerce of France. n
They sent Ito London a miniller, Mr. Jay,
known by his attachment to England, and I
his personal relations to lord Grenville, and
he concluded suddenly a treaty of commerce
which united them witb Great Britain, more
than a treaty of alliance. t
Such a treaty, under all the peculiar cir- o
cumQances, and by the consequences it must 1
produce, is an of hostility against France, *
The French Government, in ftiort, has tef. h
tifird the refeotmcat of the French nation, I
by breaking <j(F communication with an da
grateful and faith.cfs ally, until {he fliall re
turn to a trior* jnft and benevolent conduit.
Juitice and found policy, equally approve this
m?afure of the French Government. There
is no doÂ«!*t it will give rife, in the United
â¢States, to dtfeuffions which may afford a tri
umph to the party of good Republicans, the
friends of France.
Same writers, in dif-tpprobation of this
wife and necessary meafurc of the Diredtory,
maintain that in the United States, the
French have for partizans only certain dema
gogues who aun to overthrow the exilting
government. But their impudent falfehoods
convince no one* and prove only what is too
evident, that they use the liberty of the press
to serve the enemies of France."
The effects intended to be produced by
your letter in the United States,, and .the ef
fects which it must inevitably produce, -will
be hereafter examined.

THE Subscriber, Captain of the brig Schuyl
kill, of this port, having in two voyages to the*
Weft-Indies, experienced the salutary effeiflsof
a patent machine, for expelling the foul air
frÂ«m the holds cf (hips, invented by Benjamin
Wynkeop, and conftrudled in said brig ; doth
certify that the fame machine, worked by the
motion of the veflel at sea, sorted a conftaÃt
current of pure air into the {hold, from whence
the foul air was thereby expelled : that the sea
men were remarkable healthy, no disagreeable
fmellwas perceived from.the bilge water, or
provisions ; the veflel's stores, particularly the
liquors, were much cooler than common, and
the paint in the cabin not discoloured asufual in
Welt-India; voyages. AÂ» a friend to trade and
navigation, the fubferibtr thinks it his duty to
recommend the machine to general use, and
from the fifls, as ftatefl above, he fully believes
it may be the means of preserving the timber
of ships and their perishable cargoes from the
definitive effedls of foul air confined in the
holdj of (hjps, and of contributing to the health
and comforc of paftengers and seamen on board.

I hi ve examined the principle of cenft-u<sUon,
and witnessed the operation ef Mr. Benjamin
Wynkeop's ventilators on board of several ves
sels in which they have been conftru&ed, and
am of opinion they will be of great advantage
in preserving the health of the people in lhipÂ»,
and the timber from rotting, by the expulsion
of foul, and the constant circulation of freih air
which they produce :âSeveral matters of vef
fcU have informed me, that these ventilators
have also prevented the flaining of the paint in
the cabin, which they frequently observed to
take place from the exhalations arising from
bilge-water, sugar, or molaffts. I therefore
earnestly recommend their conftmÂ£)ion on board
of every veflcl, and candidly declare I do not

Mr. Liviripfion's fpcech continued.
It had been aflerted witii lingular confi.
dence that France was the firft aggr<lpjr in
spoliation, and that the Btitifh order of
council of June 1793, had been precede] by
one from the French government to the faine
purpose ; he need not enter into a refutation
of that aflertion ; the gentleman from MafTa
rhufetts (Mr. Freeman) had yellerday com
plutely exposed the fallacy of that artifice,
the French, have throughout the pvefent war
been compelled,in her own defence, to follow
the unusual measures adopted hy Britain, and
in this inflance the order iflued by the French
government, expressly Hates the British or
der in its preamble as the sole and necessary
cause of her adoption of similar jpeafures in
her own defence ; but we have ttftimony Hill
Itronger if any stronger were neccflary, it it
the declamtion of lord Grenville to Mr. T.
Pinckneyâ" Lord Grenville, on being alked,
" said Spain would pursue the fame line of
" conducS, and upon its being objedied, that
" even their late convention with Rufiia, did
" not extend to this ohjedt, he afifwered,
" that though it was not expressly mention
" ed, it was fully understood by both parties
" to be within the intention of it," âand
thus it is, that gentlemen endeavour to elude
the ttuth, and to descant upon fubterfuge
where the peace and happiness of out country
is at (lake ; that such a privilege or concession
fliould be granted to Britain in a time'of war,
was'remarkable enough to excite the jealouly
of the French government ; but that it fliould
be objefted to extend the fame privileges to
France by.negotiation is more extraordinary
am J we are told that Vattel is mistaken in
his doÂ£lrine âhe is in one cafe no authority
to be relied on, he mnft be utterly abandoned,
Dut in another his authority is sacred ; all
that had been said on the fubjeft ef this ar
ticle will equally apply to the disregard of the
neutrality of goods on neutral bottoms, ;s
declared in the inftruraent of the armed neu
trality.
Having offered his free opinion 011 these
several articles, he was willing now to de
clare as freely that there were many of the
circumstances of complaint urged by the
French Republic, which they were not
founded in carrying to the extent which they
do ; and it was on this account in an espe
cial manner that, he considered the amend
ment proposed, to deserve the most decided
support of the committee ; he had little
doubt of their being wrong, he had little
doubt of their being open to conviftion ; &
as they no doubt think themselves as much in
the right ia these cases, as they thought this
government in the wrong ; it became us to
use towards them a'language suitable to that
liberality which benefits a wife and prudent
nation ; it becomes us to examine our own
conduit and not rely on our own infallibili
ty : to enquire difpaflionately, and not rufli
into war before we have considered either the
cause or the eonfequences ; he appealed to
every gentleman, which would be the con
duit most consistent with true dignity, to
' obstinately persist in error at every rilk of cha
racter and disaster, or to examine our con
duft, and if we have erred to acknowledge
it manfully ; she does not require our humi
liation as gentlemen declaim, and if' (he did
we Ihould never submit to itâfrom a single
stipulation into which we have entered with
any nation we ought not and will not depart,'
(he does does not demand it; and therefore
we ought to fay to her we will place you
on a footing with every other nationâyou
have been mistaken in some matters, we have
been mistaken in othersâwe will difcufst(>em
and this unpleasant difference ; would this be >

Mr. Coit, from the committee of elec- I dc
tioas, made a farther report, which was or- nc
dered tolie on the table. I cl
The order of the day being called for, I ill
the house again resolved itfelf into a com- di
mittee of the whole, Mr. Dent in the chair, c<
on the address reported in answer to the |bi
speech of the President ' of the United ft
States ; when .
Mr. W. Smith enquired of the chair- r;
man whether there was not an error in coun- b
ting the votes on the question of yesterday. tl
The Chairman replied that there was. It f;
arose, he supposed, from the number of ft
strangers in the house, and from their patt
ing too near the members. The true num- o
bers were, for the amendment 46, against it il
52. He rcquefted strangers would not t
Hand so near the members as to cause a fimi- 0
lar mistake in future. e
The Chairman proceeded to read the . d
third and fourth paragraphs of the address ; f
when having read the part which fays, " al
though it is the firft and most ardent wish of v
our hearts, that peace may be maintained," c
&c, *
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) wished to t
introduce an amendment. He did not be- t
lieve it ought to be " the firft and most ar- : i
dent wish." It had been well (hewn by the 1
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sit- â  <
greaves) that liberty was more dear than ;
peace : he therefore moved to insert " ear- I
nest," indead of " firft and ardent."âCar- ! 1
ried. ]
Mr. Coit moved the amendment which
he had already laid before the committee,
after the word " world," in the 4th line of the !
4th paragraph, to add, " ami although we
wi(h that republic to stand on ground as fa
vorable as any other nation, in their rela- 1
tion to the United States j yet, &c. I
This motion not being seconded, fell of j
course.
Mr. Williams propofedan amendment,
intended as. a substitute for the above, â¢
which was ordered to lie on the table. It .
proposed to put France on the fame footing '
with other nations, profeffing that if she was j
not so, it was not owing to any partiality in
favor of any other nation, and that in ex
pressing this wish, the house did not mean to
interfere with the powers of the Executive.
Mr. Williams alio moved to insert, in
stead of "we can never surrender our
rights;" in the fame paragraph, " we never
will surrender."âCarried.
Mr. Lyon moved to strike out, in the 7th
line of the fame paragraph, " wisdom, dig
nity and moderation," and to insert in their
place, " good intentions," as he said he did
not there prepared to approve all the
former aÂ£ts of government, but for other
purposes.
Mr. W. Smith thought it would not
(how the wisdom and dignity of that house
to agree to the amendment.
; It was put and negatived, there being pn
ly 10 votes for it.
Mr. COIT said he thought that part of
the sth .paragraph which related to the exe
cutive direftory would be less exceptionable,
and equally convey their disapprobation of
such sentiments, if it were expreffied more
generally, and without any allusion to
M. Barras. He proposed, therefore, to
strike out from " at" in the 4th line of the
sth paragraph to " United States ' in the
7th fine, and to insert, " any sentiments
tending to derogate from that confidence ;
such sentiments, wherever entertained, serve
to ferince an imperfeft knowledge of the re
al cpipicn of our constituents."
, Mr. Giles seconded the motion ; but
wilhed it extended farther, as he did not
know what was meant by the exprefiion " to
separate them from.the.nfelves."

I Mr. Williams said, if Mr. Pinckney's the

I Barras was likewise so ; and if so, it was the

ir- I not think with the gentleman from Maffa- St
I chufetts (Mr. Freeman) that it was " child- me;
ir, I ifh gasconade." He believed it was inten- te
Ti- I ded as an insult on the government of this be
ir, country. As to the gratitude which had the

ed for their afliftance in the war, he thought coi
their services were arpply repaid by the fepa- for
ir- ration of this country from Great Britain ; he

the afliftance of this country, until they mu

iff- Mr. Gordon said there could be no doubt no
m- of the authenticity of Barras's speech, since nq
it it flood upon the fame ground as the reft of thi
lot the documents. It was a flagrant insult up- en
ni- on government, in his opinion, and warrant- fa<
ed all that had been said upon it, as it was M
the doubtless an attempt to separate the people it
fs j from the government. H
al- Mr. Thatcher said the question was, no
of whether or not any notice should be taken
1," of the infillting speech of Barras. When, to
said he, the French flag was presented to T
to the house, we were told we were not to flop tu
be- : to reason but express forthwith our feel- th
ar- I ings of affeftion ; but now when the most bi
the ; unexampled insult is offered to us, such as in
iit- i one man would not receive from another, we th
lan 1 are not to notice it at all, left it should offend w
;ar- the French republic. He knew of only one O
lar- I reason for passing it over in silence, and that nc
if it was true had some weight with him. V
lich That Barras spoke as the organ of the ot
tee, French nation there could be no doubt; but fu
the he had his doubts whether he knew himfelf p<
we what he said. The speech had strong marks jtc
fa- 1 of delirium, and he could not help believ- ' re
ela- I ing that when he delivered it, he was either w
I drunk or mad. If the world went on for h
[ of j 6,000 years to come, they would never again tl
j behold such a produftion. He then exam-, yi
ent, ' itled the different parts of it in a ludicrous if
ove, way peculiar to himfelf. P
It! Mr. M'Dowell was in favour of the a- b
ting i mendment. He did not think himfelf bound 1 h
was as had been insinuated by the gentleman ft
yin ' from South Carolina, to echo all the fenti- , v
ex- ments in the President's speech. He wished
nto to have an opinion of his own. He agreed f
tive. Barras's speech was an indignity to the U- t
, in- nited States ; he felt it, and would express il
our it ; but he did not think this the proper r
ever time. He denied the justness of the con- t
ftruftion put upon the speech by the gen- c
: 7th tletnan from South Carolina. He supposed '
dig- by " perfidious persons," was meant the per- 1
their sons in this country, generally called the f

1 the with that gentleman â on the fubjeft of divi- t
ither ding the people and government, and could
npt allow that the phrefe good people was
I not intended an insult. He allowed it was 1
louse going too far to fay that we owed our liber- '
ty to France ; but being in some refpeft
r on- true, it took off from the .offence- Hewas

more 'the sword. and" to fay, " We conquer or
1 to die." What gentlemen could not effeft by

f the different way. He did not think this fair
1 the conduft.
nents Mr, Venable supported the amendment,
nee ; He did not think any of the objeftions made
serve against it, had. much weight in them. He
le re- thought tie mode of exprefling our sense of
. ' the indignity shewn to this country by the
; but speech in question, was judiciously chosen
1 not by the gentleman from Connefticut. It was
j" to most consistent with dignity, It was not
wife in them to take notice of every harsh
, exprefflon which might be used against this j rti"Â«
; country-in any foreign nation ; for if such j char
\ were our conduct, foreign nations would ! luch
' have good ground of complaint -against us, |
! and on that floor the account would be set- ! Â°f ri
tied.. Nor did he think it, very becoming or [ PÂ°' t
dignified in gentlemen in that house so to ; refe:
express themSlves, as to excite frequenft ri- r efei
fibilityânor was it very honorable to that j men
Assembly. (Alluding to the gentleman , Â»pp
from Massachusetts.) l '
Mr. Sitgreaves had no doubt of the speech He
of BarrSs being an official paper, and that â  useÂ»
its objeft was to divide the people from the
â  government. If he provsd this, he trufled fult,
the language of the report would be prefcrv- men
' ed. It would be allowed that was i that
the mouth of the Direftory, and that the J Pjel
sentiments which he fpeak3, are not his own, !
' but what were before hand agreed upon.â "> ''
. It was doubtless, therefore, a folernn offici- of tj
, al aft. With refpeft to the observations of of "
i the gentleman from Virginia, that what he He
. said refpefting our government was not ap- twe
1 plicable to the Executive, but to the People aH d
1 at large,lie believed he was wholly mistaken, 'y*
t as the word government, in the French lan- of
( guagt, constantly meant Executive, as was whi
s abundantly clear from the way in which it if f<
; was used in Mr. Adet's Notes. [He quo- ban
2 ted a number of passages to prove his afferti- hke
t on.] It was generally used for the Execu- f" IC
- tive in contra diftinftion to Congress,. or a- the:
1 ny other of the constituted authorities. If at t
it were clearly intended to convey an insult
- upon our Executive (and there could be no whi
e, doubt of it,) even the mover of the amend- aga
n ment could not think it unbecoming in that m t
e House to express themselves in the words of
:- the address. 1
Mr, Gallatin said whatever might be tf ro!
â¢- insult intended by the Speech of the Execu- ' n g
i- tive Direftory, he thought it best to notice drÂ«
1- it in general terms, as it was the sentiment
:s which was .objeftionable, and not the Go- ''*â 
ir j vernment of France. But as so much had Hi
i- been said about government and people, he evl
ir would fay, that an insult offered to the people e "<
f, could not be less offenfive than one offered to dij
re the government. He supposed they alluded
c- to the British treaty, which was as much an
;e the instrument of Congress as of the Execu- ou
at tive, and of the People as either, since they 10
in very generally petitioned in favor of it. He ln
then took notice of the perversions which | Ol
â¢'s the gentleman from South Carolina had put
of upon the werds of Baiyas, and denied that tl(
as there was the least ground for them, and he
id "said that the Gazette of the United a
[a- States might as well be called a Govern- to
d- ment paper of this country, as th* Re da c- #t
:n- teur that of France. If, said Mr. G. it tit
lis be our intention to declare war at once, then co
ad there might be some propriety in taking tit
on hold of every word which would bear to be
â ht construed into an insult, but' if we wished th
ia- for peace, it was unwise to do so. Besides, nf
1 ; he said this Speech was not communicated
to in an official manner, nor could it be so com- fa
iey municated. It was sent by Mr. Pinckney it
>ur in a newspaper, from which the . copy sent to jc
them was translated, but the tranflrition was
ibt not even authenticated, as usual. He did S
ice nqt dispute the faft, but it was a thing which g
:of they were not bound to notice ; indeed an tl
ap- error with refpeft to a name appeared on the Â«
nt- face of the paper ; and delivered to n
vas Mr. Monroe who was Oo longer Minister, n
pie it could not be officially communicated.â b
He therefore thought it was not worth their g
'as, notice. n
ten Mr. Otis thought it right to pay refpeft t
en, to what was recommended by the President. n
Ito The question was whether they should no
lop tice the insult generally, or in reference to c
eel- the Direftory. He was fa favor 6f the firft,
10ft but as this was the only opportunity given f
1 as in the-addrefs of expressing their opinion of Â«
we theconduft of the French goverament, lie
end wished the address to stand as reported. Mr. t
one Otis remarked upon Barras' speech. He did '
:hat not know whatwas meant by granting peace. â¢
tim. When parties were at war, one granted the t
the other peace ; or sometimes a stronger fiower
but fuffered a weaker to be at peace ; âhe sup- 1
lfelf posed tha French it in the latter sense <
arks towards this country, on condition that we 1
[iev- ' refpeft her. What was meant here ? If it :
tlier was sovereignty over their own nation, we
1 for had nothing to do with it ; if it was any o
gain ther, it muff be the sovereignty they had o
;am- ver us. He concluded by remarking, that
rous if there were any members in that house u
pon whom any imputation could reft of their
e a- ' being unduly attached to the French cause,
rand 1 he thought it a good opportunity to come
man forward and convince the world the charges
end- ; were unjust.
ifhed j Mr. Livingston took notice of what had
reed fallen from the gentleman last up, and shewed
e U- the folly of adopting an irritating tone ; as,
press if we charged a foreign government with
oper making use of of one difrefpeclful expreflion,

gen- complaint, as in the course of that debate,

| Mi. W, Smith again urged the propriety. t^c

reference to the Prefidefii's fpeeph, as that "
1 referred to an ofÂ§:ial aft ; whereas the amend

apply to tlie people of Ch ; na, or the people 1
â  of this country, as well auto those of France.
He believed the discussion had beer, of f >me IWfl

of Thomas Paine to the writings of Moses. *"')
He denied lh;it there were any similarity he- " ne

The queOion was put on # the amendment, luu
when there appeared 49 vutes for it, and 49 "" l
againll it. The chairman declared it carried 1 c

There is prifmveiy asmuch difference between '
these pretended coitfin germans, as between
my sermons, and those of the Arch Bishop
of Csnleibury.

the second fight of a Scotchman, that I may
discover your approaching bankruptcy.
Young man, 1 fay unto thee, walk gently

run. Observe the impatient racer. He is

circumfpeflly, it is Paul's advice, not like a

In m\- boyhood, 1 remember that a parent
would sometimes repeat lesions of (economy
as I fat on his knees, and then lift me in his
arms that I might look at HoGarth's plates
of Induflry amd ldlencfs. On youthful fan
cy the pitture was more imprefTed than the

readers, who tire at the didadlick and the '
ttite (tile of morality, I will attempt a (ketch
or two ; wi h a little cÂ«lou<unG.
I will imagine the figure of a tripling,
educated for business. Seven years he swept
and garnished a compting house ; opened it
at five, and did not bar it until nine ; fold
ropes and boxes for himfelf, as well as bales
for his master j read " The Sure Guide to
Love and Esteem," and worked every rule
in Hodder's Arithmetick. This, all mull '
allow, was a gentle pace. No freaks, no
starts discompose the placid life of a youth
in these habits. Men already look forward,
and behold him a Dank Director, or fee him
in the largest store, in the mart.
One ill omen'd day, when the moon was
full, or the dog star growled, ( I do not re
member which, our sober youth, whose
studies were seldom more miscellaneous, than
. an invoice, or a bill of lading, unluckily
, had his eye caught by a Land advertisement
in a newspaper. It will abridge a tedious
. process of circumstances to imagine him in
, Georgia. How many acres of sand were
then bought and fold, and how he dafiied
about thy falls, St. Antony, who art, more
j visited, than the (hrine of Thomas a Becket!
f Over these sands he already drives in his cha
, riot, with somebody by his fide too ; a La
t. dy from Babylon. Although the carriage
5 is encumbered with a speculator, and ,
and imaginary bank bills in bales, yet how
0 we glide along, not like the son of Ahi- â
c maaz, bringing good tidings. The driving
r is like the charioteerfhip of the son of Nitn
