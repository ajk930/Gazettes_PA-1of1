CONGRESS.
HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES,
Saturday, July.
Mr. N. FatFMAN obtained leave of obfence
for tho re.minder of the feflion.
Mr. R> ed reported the bill fixing the time of
the next meeting of Congress, which was ac
cordingly figrted by the Speaker.
Mr. Brookes thought the preterit naturaliza
tion law allowed foreigners too soon to become
citizens of the United States: he wished the law
therefore to be revised, and proposed the follow
ing refoluticn: %
Rel'olved, That a committee be appointed to
prepare and report a hill to amend the a<ft eftab
lifhirig an uniform rule of naturalization. Or
dered to lie en the table.
The bill for continuing proeefsTrt the circuit
court in the state cf North Carolina, was read
the third time ; and was about to be pafied,
when the question on palling was about to be
taken;
Mr, J. Williams wished to know what was
the caul'e of the'negledl: of the Circuit Court
Judges, which gave occasion for this bill.
Mr. Blount said, that he had received a let
ter from Georgetown, Sout': Carolina, inform
ing him, that the cause of the omission waÂ« that
Jydge Chafe's hurfe bad tired.
The bill was pa (Ted.
The amendments of the#enateto the bill for
continuing in force.feveral afls and parts of a<9s,
were taken up, one of them negatived, and ano
ther amended. The Senate afterwards sent the
bill down with the amendments concurted in.
The House then took up the amendments re
ported by the committee of the whole to the bill
laying a (lamp tax, when the amendment being
under consideration, imposing a tax of twenty
dollars (inftt ad of twenty cents, as dated in our
paper of Saturday ) on certificates of Naturaliza
tion.
Mr. Sw a,n WICK laid, this tax would operate,
in some degree,, as a poll tax, and he thought
20 dollars too confidersble afum for this purpose.
Mr. W. Smith said Jie sum could not be al
tered but by recommitting the bill.
Mr. Gallatin believed the sum might be
deereafed, though it could not.be increufed in
the House.' '
The Speaker confirmed the opinion that it
would be in order to leflcn the sum,
Mr. Swan wick, then moved that the twenty
dollars be reduced to four. In a subsequent part
of the bill, soar dollars were charged as a (lamp
upon any letters patent, and if this were thought
fufficient for a thing of this kind which proba
bly proved very lucrative to the party, he tho't
it would be quite enough foe a foreigner ro pay,
wljen he took upon hinifelf all the rights of a
citizen. This tax might operate upon persons
who might not have twenty dollars in the world.
When they spoke the other day on the fubjeff
of rich moniod corporations, it was hoped they
Ihould be moderate in the tax irnpofed upon
them ; he trufled they Ihould not be less so when
the peir emigrant was concerned.
Mr. Sewall hoped the amendment would
not be madÂ« Evtrv foreigner who came to
this country, had a full opportunity of getting a
living without enjoying the lights of a citizen ;
and he knew nut why he (hould become a citi
zen, if he did not think (he privilege worth 20
dollars, and was willing to pay it.
Mr. Gordon gave it as a rcafon for not di
miiiifhing this fom, that foreigners might live
were five years, without being omiged te serve
any public offices, such is eonltable, &c.
' Mr ..Brookes did not think the sum exceflive.
He would not have thÂ« right of citizenlhip made
too common. He had no objeiiion to the ad
mitting of foreigners into this country, hut there
were foreigners came here, fugitives fremjuflice,
and others, who never would be of any advan
tage to any country. These, for the final! sum
of 10 dollars, might become citizens âhe would
not have them admitted for less, as it would be
neceflary te have some fecurily for the attach
ment of persons to the government of this coun
try ; and such men as would be of advantage to
the country would not think the sum too large.
Mr. Gallatin denied that the argument of
the gent'eman frotn New-York would apply, as
a person's paying a sum of money, would be no
proof that he was well aflefted to the govern*
ment. A conviil er a highwayman might
bly pay te dollars with greater ease than the
wortiiieft of men.
Mr. G. said he objefled to the sum of twenty
dollars, because it would opei'ate in a very im
proper manner. A Tingle man might, in a
(hort time, save the money neceflary to purehafe
his citizenship ; but he knew a great uumber of
persons, who cime to this country with large
families, very valuable emigrants, and upon
whom we had more security for their good be
haviour than upon single men, upon whom this
tax would fall very heavy.
He objefled to the tax also as iv related to the
children of those persons.""He knew a great num
ber of emigrant families, with many children,
whose heads werenot'at prcfent citizens of this
country; and these children, if their fathers
should not be able, or Ihould neglefl, to become
a citizen, though they may have received their
education here, ind formed the ftrongelt attach
ment to the government and country, yet, be
fore they can become citizens, they wi l<ach of
them have to pay 20 dollars. This would be
extremely hard, and it would not only be hard,
bet it might become dangerous to the ptace of
the country ; besides that the property ef every
person not being a citizen would want that se
curity which it woyld otherwise have. Nor did
he conceive it would be perfectly fafe to have
one fourtbi if not one third part of the inhabi
tants of a country living as foreigners, in its bo-
Cora. These men, speaking the fame language,
and having the fame manners, after they had
been in the country ten or fifteen years, would
lock upon the refufal to admit thera to the com
mon tight of citizens, except upon the payment
ef 30 dollars, as unjufi and oppreflive. If so
large a sum was charged, Mr. G said, provision
(hould be made, in favour of the children of such
fathers as Ihould not themfclves have been citi
zenr- As four dollars might, perhaps,he thought
too small a sum, he (hould move to strike out the
twenty, and to leave the sum blank
Mr. obferved, that it had
been urged in favor of this large sum, that
foreigners would not be obliged to become
citizens, as they might get a living in the
country without doing so. But was it not
of advantage yhe allied, that foreigners fliould
become c:tiÂ«as, and not that a great part
of the people of our country (hould be living
among!! us, without owing allegiance to
' our government ? But'it faid these em!
! grants might be highwaymen, or men of bad
chara&er > but did not the naturalization
law require, that every person applying to
be made a citizen, should produce two wit
nefles to l'peafc ro their moral character :
And surely after a r'efidence of five years,
and a guard of kind, there could not be
any reason for such arguments. It (hould
seem, from what was said, on this Occasion,
that twenty dollars was to be the price upon
which we were willing to admit the vvorft of
charafters to the privilege of citizen (hip.
But it was said, that if this tax were not
laid, the rights of citizenship would become
too common. This was a doctrine contra
ry to aliy thing he had heard before on the
fubjeft. Since the year 1776 it had been
uniformly the language of this country, that
we had, in weftern world, opened an
asylum for emigrants from every country.
This was our language: " Come and join us
in the ble flings we enjoy in a country large
and fertile, and under a government founded
upon the principles of liberty and justice."
Were the inhabitants of this country all
born in it ? Certainly not ; a great majority
were foreigners ; even in the government it
felf were very many foreigners. And (hould
they, because they came a little sooner, or
had better fortune than others, fay to their
less fortunate brethren, " you (hall not be
admitted to the privilege of citizenship but
on the payment of twenty dollars, though
we received it without money and without
price ?" It was said a man might soon earn
20 dollars to pay for this privilege ; but sup
posing he could soon earn 50 dollars, he did
, not think that a good reason for laying this
tax.
The gentleman from NengHampfliire had
alledged as a reason for this high tax, that
foreigners were excused, before they became
citizens, from (haring in the burdensome
offices of the community ; but he thought
this was a rcafon for admitting foreigners
earlier, in order to (hare such offices with
our citizens. For it would be a curious
thing, if there (hould be occasion for the
services of these men in defending the coin
try, if they (hould refufe to turn out, oe
caufe they had been refufed adifi'iTion to the
participation of its immunities.
In a country like ours, he said, it was ex
tremely impolitic to throw obftru&ions in
the way of emigrations. He was desirous
that every attention (hould be paid to the
moral character of emigrants before they
were admitted as citizens, but he trusted
they (hould not degrade the country in the
eyes of foreign nations by putting so high a
tax upon the privilege of citizenship. It
would ill suit the high tone which had been
held abroad of the liberty of this country ;
nor did he think their constituents would be
well pleased with such a tax.
If they compared this tax with other
parts of the bill, it would be found much
heavier than any other. A lawyer was to
pay 1 o dollars upon the entrance of his lu
crative profeffion ; whilst a poor foreigner
was to pay 20 to be admitted as a citizen.
In doing this, gentlemen seemed desirous
only of having rich emigrants as citizens,
whilst the poor wanderer, flying from the
hearth tax of Ireland, or from the oppressi
ons of other countries, who would be vastly
ufeful in the cultivation of our land, and in
every ufeful labour, would be in a great mea
sure excluded from their rights in society. â¢
Mr. Harper enquired if it would be in
order to llrike out the whole provision I
Being told it would not, he said he should
then be in favor of the present motion, and
if it were carried, vote against the whole.
He did not think the lubjett had any con
nexion with the present bill ; nor was he
of opinion that to lay a tax of this kind
would be a means of securing to us better
citizens, than if there were no tax. He
would have citizenship given without price,
but he would require a longer residence to
be neceflary than was required by the pre
sent naturalization law.
He did not agree with the'gentleman last
up, on the propriety of inviting emigrations
from all parts of the world. There was a
moment of enthusiasm in this country, when
this was thought to be right, when \be were
not fatistied with giving to emigrants every
blefling which we had earned with our blood
and treasure, but admitted them instantly
into the rights of citizenship. An experi
ence of ten or fifteen years, he said, had
convinced us we were wrong. They had
done something to prevent the evil in future;
but he thought they should do more. He
should be willing that no man (hould become
a"citizen of this country but by birth : he
would have all foreigners freely admitted,
and he would admit their children to have
a right to citizenship. He believed this
would be a proper policy for this and every
other country.
Mr. Swanwick withdrew lift motion.
Mr. Macon opposed the tax? altogether,
as tending to injure the poor and industrious
part of the emigrants to this country, which
he looked upon as the most valuable.
Mr. Goodrich did not think it was in
ordA- to discuss the propriety or impropriety
of encouraging emigration. The only ques
tion before them was, whether or not the
certificate of citizenship was a proper objeft
of taxation. He thought it was. It was
not a sale of citizenship, as had been repre
sented, but a stamp tipc n this kind of paper.
He thought the argument of the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, that if a father neglected
to become a citizen, all his children, before
they could be citizens, would have each to
pay 20 dollars 5, would be a tie upon parental
affe&ion, for a father to do what his chil
dren would be so much- benefited by.
Mr. Vendible did not know that it Was
neceflary to take a certificate when a person
was naturalized, and therefore the duty
might be evaded.
Mr. Craik doubted not, if this tax were
laid, that if persons were not now obliged
to ta:cc a certificate, such an obligation
would be laid upon them. He voted in Hi
of 20 dollars ; but, on reflection, he thouJM
the sum too large. He believed the
proper for taxation, and should only
the fubjeA in that light. It would .fl
operate, he said, on men coming into tlfl
country only, but upon many persons alrea.W
in it. He had been frequently witness 9
applications from men to become cit(zenM
who had been i{i the Country from the yc.H
1783.. Many of these, fmce the paffirig I
the general law, had been fl
tural.ized under the general date laws; anlÃ
if it were determined that this naturalization ]
was not effectual, they v ould have the ceh> I
mony again to go through under the law oU
the Unitid States. It was very unfoundÃ
policy, and he questioned the cbnfiftency oM
it, to mrke property a rule for a man's be-1
coming a citizen. One of the rights of J
citizen was #oting at an election, and it ifl
was neceffai y he' mould be poffefltd of a ceil
tificate of this kind bÂ«fore his vote could bl
admitted, it would be the fame thing as tl
require him to be possessed of a certain pofl
tion of property before he had a right I
vote. In this view he thought the principlH
improper. He wished the gentleman froJB
Pennsylvania had not withdrawn his motion, 1
as he fhculd be in favor of voting for a fmaJl 1
sum.
Mr. Lyon w?s opposed to this amendment
It appeared to him in Urious, cruel and impoh
ric. It was injurious, bccaufe we had dealt on;
a different kind of language heretofore* weba>
toil! the world, that there was in this country
S*ood i'pring of Liberty, and invited all to com:
and daink of it. We had told them the country
was rich and fertile, and invited ffacm ccmi
and taste of our fruits; and he did not think i
right now to turn found to them anrl fay
" You shall not be admitted as citizens urt'efs yoi
n treaty, offenfive and defenfive with the Mo
njrch of Britain, to prevent his fubjeifs fron
: aving him and coming hither. He was almof
led to fufpefl the thing was introduced oa th(
fucireflioi of a certain Foreign Minister.
The Speaker declared such fuggeftionÂ®
to be wholly out of order.
Mr. Sewall said, tho' he wifned this
cpuntry to be an asylum for men of every
other who chose to come to it, yet he die
not wish to fee foreigners our Governors;
fold indeed, if they were, admitted as voter 3
at our elections, they in some degree, be
came the governors of pur country. He
wi flied, therefore, that a longer residence
Hmuld be necefTary, before a foreigner should
become a citizen. He liked this amend
ment, because it made it neceflary for a man
to have a little property before he could be
admitted. "This was looked upon as neces
sary in every other country. Nor did he
think the tax too large, as any man might
afford to pay this sum after he had beei> five
years in the country. They had seen men
to-day take the oath of allegiance and be
come citizens of the United States, and the
next again be :ome citizens of the French
by entering on board.their pri
vateers.
Mr. R. Williams said, there was fuf
ficient reason for disagreeing to this pro-io
fition, without considering the policy or im
policy of admitting foreigners to the right.l
cf citizenship. The objeft of (his bill, t:e
said, was to lay a tax upon property, -sr -
evidence of property, and he wished it t(, us l
confined to thgt objeft. This amendment a
was rather a tax upon liberty, than upon I
property, and therefore improper to be in-J
iroduced into it. As to what was said
the gentleman from Massachusetts on ijfl .
fubjeft of a foreigner being possessed of
property before lie, should be admitted aw a
citizen, such a consideration might be. a ge; d
one, introduced in its proper place, but r.ot
here. He trusted, therefore, the amend
ment would not ijevail. In place of 20
dollars, he lhould be unwilling to vote for a
cent for this object, since he believed th
principle to be wrong.
Mr T hatcher said, gentlemen viewed
only one fide of the qucftlofi : They eon
flan tly spoke of the 20 dc liars, which they
called an enormous sum ; but they said no
thing of the benefits which were to be re
ceived in return. They were to feceive for
that sum all the advantages which this coun
try had obtained by much treasure and
blood. He thought the doors of naturali
zation too wide. Too many foreigners em
igrated hither ; they were out of propor
tion to the natives ; for he wished.the Ame
rican interest always to prevail over all for
eign interest. He would much rather, there
fore, that the certificate was forty dollars
than twenty.
Mr. J. Williams did not think thjj
question was put upon its true ground. This
bill was intended to raise funds towards
paying off the national debtâthe debt in
curred in fighting for our liberty and inde
pendence ; and shall those, said he, who
come to partake of these advantages, pay
nothing for it ? If the country was not
worth the tax imposed, foreigners would net t
come to it. If the tas were too high, it
might be lowered : o â¢ if too low, made
higher. He was for having the law go into
effeft, as experience would enable them 10
make it more perfect. A#jy man who was
indtjftrious, he was certain, would never be
grudge the payment of 20 dollars for this
objeft-âhe would rather glory in it. The
liberty of the country was rated very low
indeed, when it was not thought to be worth
twenty dollars.
Mrr Brookes was in favour of retaining
the clause. Twenty dollars could not be
said to be the price of naturalization, but
merely as a stamp upen the certificate j nor
was there any more impropriety in this,
than laying a duty upon the admifiion of
lawyers to exercise their profeffioi).
Mr. M'Dowell was against the amend
ment. He looked upon it as a departure
from the spirit of oar Government, and de
rogatory to us-as an enlightened nation.â
It had been remarked by gentleman, that
we had fought and-bkd for our liberties. It
was true, that we baa fought for liberty,
but, he trusted, we did not mean to confine
it to ourselves, I. â¢ V 1! ,it out to others. |
On the cootprjr, vf other countriesr â¼
P L. d been i iviirj 'uycome and psrtake with
I of . otÂ»r laws had Mlgaic,
K| to this bi.it now, after vvil't numbers were
| come, and others wore coming, all at once,
wo piopofc to id: 1 e file of our privileges.
I F. us he couid not agree to. It was 'not
the woaithy, the fi:gh bred, the well born,
j tnat he wanted to emigrate to our country ;
h was a different class of men., viz. mecha
nics, farmers, and < t lier hiduftrious per.
sons ; it was men like these .who were
granted to improve our country, and it would
very inconvenient for them to pay the
1 sum pt opofed. If the country were frfiall
and full of people, there might be feme
ground for the policy 5 but there was none
at present.
Mr. Gallatin said, when he was up be
fore, the question was whether the tax
fnOuid be reduced from twenty dollars to
four; it was now whether there should be a-'
ny. He confidei ed this law merely as a re
venue law by means of stamps; but it ap
peared from what had fallen from the gen
tleman from Maffacliiifetts (Mr. Sewall)
that the: clause now under consideration was
not so much introduced for the purpose of
revenue as for changing the law refpe&ing
naturalization. He conceived that law had
nothing'to do with the present question;
indeed it would be impossible to take the ne
cessary views of fubjeft, whilst they
were considering the bed way of raising a
revenue by means of stamps. They had
proposed to raise a revenue from certain pa
pers in txiftence ; but this proposition went ,
to tax a paper which had no existence; for j
a new law must be passed, if this clause was :
â  agreed to, directing that these certificates ' '
fhallbe issued. The proper way of doing
the business. would be to fay, that no man J
should be admitted a citizen without paying ' ,
20 dollars. There would be no occasion '
for a stamp to do this.
But if the clause before them were to be
considered as intended to operate as a theck
upon naturalization, he did not think it a
proper way of doing it. He did not think
they ought to put a price upon the right of
citizenftiip. The gentleman from Mafia- '
chufetts (Mr. Thatcher) laid they were to ,
consider the advantages received for the 20 j t
dollars; so that according to his idea the '
value of a citizenfliip would be worth 20
dollars, and of course that it would be too
dear at 50. He, on the contrary, thought j'
the privileges of an American citizen inva- v
luable to every one who was sensible of their
importance; and that money could not be !
placed in comparison with them.
Mr. G. juftified the manners ofÂ«the peo
ple of Pennsylvania. though that state had
always encouraged emigration, even whilst
under the British government. Indeed, he p
said, the manners of Europe were the man- ! j
tiers of this country. In the firft conftitu- q
tion of Pennsylvania, every man who resi
ded one year in the state was entitled to citi- '
ifenfhip. There was a. time when this was o)
also the policy of the "United States. In
order to prove this, he read the following '
passage from the Declaration of Indepen
dence.
" The history of the present King of ]
Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries
and rfnrp-ations, all having in direÂ£t objedt
the establishment of an ablblute tyrranny t(1
over these states. To prove this, let fadts
be fubmitten to a candid world. v .
And then, amongst other grievances the t ;,
Declaration states, that" He has endea- I '
voured to present the population of these !
states; for that purpose, obftrudling the ' _ r
laws for naturalization of foreigners j refu- ' |, e
sing to pass others, to encourage their mi- /
gration theither, and raising the conditions
of new appropriations of lands." f
If there was a certifiSite direfted to be
issued on a person's becoming a citizen of j?''
the United States, he (hould have no ob
jedlion to lay any model ate duty upon it; t j t
and if the object was revenue, he was cer- g,
tain a small sum would raise more than a en
larger. He should therefore, renew the p.,
motion of bis colleague to reduce the 20
dollars to 5, that the sense of the house | na
might be taken tipon it; for if a small sum
was agreed upon a great number of emi- a fl
grants to this country since the year 17*0,
who" having been made citizens by the go- tec
vcrnment of the state, believe themselves to pj.
be citizens, would renew the ceremony, ac
cording to the laws of the United States. ] 0I!
There were from 7 to 8,000 persons of this . mc
description in the state of Pennsylvania a- oc(
lone. ;
Mr. G. again spoke of the hardship under . f u ]
which a tax of 20 dollars would lay the poor i COI
man, and especially his children, who would
be punished for the neglect, the poverty or ( , t ,'
the death of their parent. He trusted, there- ' 5
fore, if a tax were laid upon these certifi- his
catee, it would be a low one. I P'd
Mr.J. Williams moved to (hike out 5 do!-1 J
lars, and insert ten He said that such persons t
?.s wete not naturalized were still feeured in Lj:
the poffeftion of their land in the flare of New a
York, by an annual law for that purpose; and J
he doubted not the fame was done in the t0 \
state of Pennsylvania, therefore that could be t!
no objefl'i 1 to the tax. 7
