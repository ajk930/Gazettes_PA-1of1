MEMOIRS
Of the Haufe of Savoy, -with fomt account of the
Court of Sardinia.
... p p THE sudden aggrandisement and fpe?dy decline
of the house of Savoy, is ft problem only to those
th endear'd, unacquainted with its history.
The rocks of Mount Cenis proved as lucrative
formerly to the Princes of .Piedmont, as the found I
r does at present to. the Kings of Denmark. Du
e renew , ring the long and bloody wars, between the houses I '
â of Bourbon and Aaftria, this turnpike road into I
flow, Italy was frequented by each of them, and a toil ''
frown regularly levied on the favored army. Nay, if we 1
believe hiftory,.it was actually put up to au&ion, I '
n and let to the highcft bidder. 1
Little slates, as they possess no real phyficial I F
, strength, provided they enter the vortex of Euro- "
P ean intrigue, muftaccuftom themfeJves tea certain J 0
degree of political and their governors I
nme, must frequently appear in the humiliating but nee
Aired gaze, ceflary character of perpetaal'balance mailers. In "
c " (liort, it is by a change of position alone that they J
w can preserve their and prevent a sudden I
subversion. tl
If was owing to this policy, that the petty Counts oi
of Maarienne became Dukes of* Savoy, and the I V
â nd ; Dukes of Savoy Kings of Sardinia. It is in con- [th
i sequence of a departure from such a system, that m
i, J newl y cr sated royalty has been recently shorn J
ham ? I "Â® fa r*> after riling in splendour, at the be- IP r
ginning of the present century, (1718) seems but wi

Ive nearly from S. to N. and is not more than thivear
his four hundred yards wide. The distance from A-'

jly about 100 miles.âThe springs iflue from the foot
of the hill or mountain or. the weft, which is pret
al- ty high and sleepâthey form so considerable a
Isj stream as to turn a mill within a few rods. The
g, water is perhaps something below the temperature
n. of new milk. At iirft it is not generally re'ifhed
vi as think, but in a few days it is taken in quantities
k8 that are almost incredible. Eyery person repairs to
'' le fp nn si;Â» where two boys are (latior.ed, and hand

e. "s a house with five convenient baths, which are

1 I was thereâbut more were cxpe/iedâthey come
; from the tide waters of the Chefapeak, where inter
s mittents prevail, from Alexandria, GorgetoWn, Bal

-1 tic and bilious complaints usually get relief if they
live temperately. The surrounding country is rough
and barreu, with some fruitful fpols interspersed,
the salubrity of the air in the neighbourhood ot
the mountains, makes a few weeks residence here,
bencficjal to moll perfon*in ill health.
Thcaccommodatione are as as could be
expected where many persons are crotided into a
small village, of from fifteen to twer>ty honfeg.â
There are four or five good boarding

take houses and provide for themselves. The morn.
ingsand evenings are cool at Bath, as the (ituation
would lead you to conclude. It is excelfively warm
in the middle of the day, when the rays of the
meridian fun fall directly upon the spot.
It is not invalids alone who frequent this place.
In returning from Bath, it is often enquired, *' who
