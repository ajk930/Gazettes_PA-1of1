I run for this place, where we arrived on the infc
I 10th inft. allc
I After our arrival I was ordered not to wit
I leave the veflel without leave. The prize fuc
j master went on shore, and returned in half o f}
' I an hour, and ordered me into the boat, and me<
I told me to go to the commissary, who Â»x- the
I amined me very closely. He informed me all
I I (hould lose my veflel and cargo, and that pre
I might expeft nothing else, and that I
â¢ might be very happy if I did not go to pri- ma
j son. I then a iked permiflion to go to Point I j
j Petre, and on my arrival there f met two coi
' captains from Cape Ann, near Boston ; wil
I made my cafe known to them, they im- his
' I mediately turned round and left me on the >w\
I wharf. I was then in ' very greaf distress,
I having no money nor any place to get a din- I
ner. I flopped there for about ten minutes I
I and saw a boat coming on shore, which I I
thought looked like Americans ; they pro- no
ved to be Capt. Fitzpatrick of New-York, of
and capt, Lawfon of Philadelphia, super- foi
cargo of a Danish brig. Upon making my th
I cafe known tq them, capt. F. told me he ev
I was in the fame situation with regard to los
capture, but that he had some money to as- re
d I fift himfelf, or he should have been in a poor I th
I situation ; for he had been here a month, I t'n
- and had done nothing. He genet-oufly told Y
I me that I should not want as long as he I te
could aflift me. Mr. Conflant (the only g<
L .j I friend to America here) told me he was I if
jn I very sorry for me, and that he would aflifl I S
ch me as much as lay in his power ; that I fa
"â  need not expeft to save my veflel. g

will lie dry in the 'bottom ; should not lie

better kept without than within doors.
1Â° Care should be taken to place fruits of equal

' RKTORT OF THE SECRET COMMITTEE.
, . The r-jport having been read Mr. Pel
itaiit said it would be cnneceffary at present
for him to trouble the house with many ob
servations, because as a committee of the
ijords were fitting on the fame fubjetk, the
step Avhich ought now to be taken
PWs tq fend the report to them. He could
not however, help observing that what had
now trtofpired nraft convince every man
that it was not legillating which should be
refortedto, to.repress this daripg and dark
conspiracy, but to those strong measures
which the executive government had already
adopted, with the approbation of the house.
This report juftified to the fulled extent
those mcafuresâand at the fame time cal
led on the gentlemen of the houseâand on
a very loyal fubjeft to drain every nerve
to put down thi* society : Nor did he think/
formidable as they might appear, that there
was any reason to fear that the loyalty ps
the country and the force of thtf Statp,
would not be fully fufficient to crush them ;
their numbers it was reasonable to believe,
had been greatly exaggerated in these pa
pers, as it was plain that they tried every
mode to keep up the fpints of their'deluil
ed followers, as well by fallacious statements
of their force, as by the' expe&ation of
foreign affiStance. For his own part he be
lieved the great body ps the people were
loyalâaud he.would,be proud to exert every
power he poflefTed in oppofiug this band of
daring traitors ; but he hoped that the pub
lication of this report would open their eyes
and (hew them the danger and the crimes
into were hastening. He hop
ed this report would open the eyes of other
persons also, No man in the house, he was
fare, would deny that parliamentary reform
And Catholic emancipation were fair quef- !
tions for discussion, either in or out of parli
amentâbut he was confident that when it
was known that these , were only made pre
tences for introducing confifcation, murder
and a republicâthey would be less zealous
in urging these questions at such a time. He
concluded by moving that this report be
communicated to the Committee of the
Lords, and that it ie printedâOrdered.
Mr. Pelham, without preface brought up
the report of the secret committee appointed
to consider of the papers seized in Belfaft,
and to report their opinion thereon. This
report, which consists of sixty nine folio
pages, was read at full length by the clerk ;
we must content onrfelves at this time with
giving a summary of its contents.
iThe committee began by dating, that
they cpnfidered it to be efTential tp a peeper

to confine their enquiries to the fpecific pa

hope or fear, pr-any other ipotivc, give evi

any expressions which he may hear at the
meeting of the society." The other papers
which the committee have copied into their
report, are minutes of the proceedings of
sub-committees of United Iri/hmen; and re
ports on a variety, of fnbje&s. They con
tain in the firft place accurate returns of the

maDntr and purposes for which tjie money
ha? been expended. The returns of guns,
bayonets, swords, spiles, cannon, powder in
barrels, and in weight, of ball cartridges, ps
bullets, &c. &C. are all reported with equal
accuracy,- and always accompanying the re
turns of the men and money.

â  The most important event announced, is
the intelligence relative to the iufurreclion
on hoard the British fleet commanded by
Lord Cornwallis, and deilined for the East
Indies. Though the Paris Editor does not
appear to attach much credit to the authori
ty on whicli this news is founded [letters
from-Loudon] âyet we thing it corroborates
the accounts we published last week from
from Marblehead ; which may now be ren
dered less dubious.
PARIS, May 16.
On the 14th irrft. the Directory is said to
have appointed Buoilaparte (brother of the
general) ambaffaflor to Romeâand Sche
. rer, Consul General to re fide at New-York.
Mr. Scherer is brother of the general of
that name.
LA FAYETTE and his companions
in misfortune Bureau de Pufy, and Latour
Mauionrg, are liberated. Buonaparte did
not wait for special inftruftions from the
Diretlcry, but demanded and obtained their
enlargement, immediately after the signa
ture of the preliminaries with the Emperor.
We are aflurtd that La Fayette is determi
ned to repair to Paris in the character of a
prisoner, and that he means to foiicit a for
mal trial.
â ' May 23.
Letters have been, received from London
of the 15th instant, which announce, that
a new infurreftion has taken place in the
British fleet, commanded by Lord Cornwal
lis and deilined for India. The admiral
having given orders for failing, the crews
refuted to obeyâhe resolved on decisive
measures and directed the mutineers to be
fired on. This step, far from calming the
infurredtion, served only to exasperate the
sailors, who soon obtained the entire com
mand of several (hips. They immediately
arretted Lord Cornwallis and many of the
superior officers, and appointed a commission
of delegates from the several (hips to try
themâMean while,, deputations from the
fleet were sent to the other ports in England
to engage all the sailors in a common cause
for obtaining the justice they require of gov
