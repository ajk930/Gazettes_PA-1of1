The Ambassador of the new-fangled Cis

in an official note, to Citizen " Beaucoup de th

on foot to overturn the Cisalpine Conllitu

who assembled at the house of the French
AmbafTador, Tronve, composed the com
mittee of innovation."âOh! the blejjings of
French Fraternity !

their schemes of deception, should fend an

will be fair play, it is effcntial that the go

NEW-YORK, November 9. -
We htar that Capt. Leonard and Mr.
Rutledge had a meeting yesterday morning,
near Powles Hook, to fettle the differences
between them. And it is with regret we
add,that in exchanging a cauple of (hot Mr. '
Rutledge was wounded, though slightly, in
the thigh. We are happy to find th?t
captain L. ha 3 aÂ£led with great propriety
from the firlt origin of this affair to its pain-
,ful termination. He neither ralhly preeipi
, tated himfelf irito unnecessary peril ( nor L
did he, when he found latisfa&ion was not h
to be obtained by a proper explanation, he- Q
fitate a single moment to seek it by the on q
ly alternative left to a man of conscious in-
tegrity and courage-
It is astonishing to what dirty, pitiful ar- f
tificÂ«s, the papers unfriendly to government c
sloop, to further their purpose*. This is
mod visible in those which are publilhed in
obfeure villages and remote parts of the Â»'
country. No misrepresentations, no sals- c
lioods are too gross to be reje&ed. They a
press into their vile service every thing that
will promote their views, without regaid to
truth, honor, or the public good. Even 11
the decency of appearance is by some-entire- J
ly thrown alide as a useless incumbrance â c
The only confutation we have, is, that the -y
most of them are as destitute of talents as
they are of probity.
The Jacobin papers throughout the con- \
tinent are constantly mourning the fate of r
their brethren the United Irishmen, and
harrowing up dur imaginations with hideous
pidtures of new and more enormous taxi's,
and greater loads of galling chains, imposed e
on the unhappy sons of E'rin Why do Â£
they not turn their eyes to their beloved
France, groaning under the weight of the
most oppressive military government that 1
ever df grated the page ofhiftory.
We are happy in perceiving the growing (
jealousy of foreigners. The innundation of (
fufpiciou3 charaders, particularly from Ire- 1
land and Ftaiwe, should awaken the most fe- I
rious concern in every bread, anxious for
the fafety and hsppinefs of these now Unit- I
Â«d and profpei*ous_ States. We (hall ere I

HEALTH COMMITTEE.
Tlie Health Committee for the 1
the sick and indigent in the city of
York, beg leave tÂ® congratu'ate their fel
low-citizens, that under Divine Providence
â¢ his long affli&ed city is once more restored
to its usual (late of General Health, and
with thÂ« moll heartfelt pleasure inform those
who yet remain in exile, that although a I
few cases of the pestilential fever exifl, yet
that by the late cool weather and frofls, the
contagion is so fardellroyed as to render the
morn of their lamili?s to the city perfeS
ly fafe. provided they take the necessary
previous meaftircs of cleanfiog and ventilat
ing their long unaired dwellings, and puri
fying the bedding and cloathing which miy
have been left therein during the prevalence
of the fever.
It would have afforded the committee
much fatisfaftion could they have given this
invitation at an earlier period, but they did
not conctive themfclves warrant-d by the
then exilling circumllances. There have
until the present moment been several new
caseS of fever, particul rly among those ci
tizen* who'returned earlier thin the com
mittee thought prudent, many of whom
hare fallen vi&ims tu the devouring pcfti- j i
lence. This, among other circumilances, I .
has induced the committee to withhold this j i
invitation Until the present time. The com- i
mittee beg leave furtlmr in in form their 1
fellow-citizens, that from the numerous ap
plications from the indigent for relief, they <
find it absolutely nec.effary to continue their i
labors fomc tune longer.
N. B. The committee continue thiir
meetings at the New Alms House, where
they will thankfully receive such donations
as may be offered for the relief of the poor.

I. Common lufurancei, on hazards of the firft pa
cJafs, will be undertaken at a premiUiÃ of ahout thi
halt per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous or
rifijues a larger pVeir.ifm will be required, which J e]
will vajy according to circunftadces, faidem ex- ot)
teeding one per cent, per annum ; but in some i-n
---llances, where the property insured Â» not only in
itfelf extra hazardous, but rendered still morefo tQ _
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and n)(
occupations, the premium dtmandsd will be raised
according to ciTcamftalncts.
Houfcs and Ware-Houses, the walls and perti- .
tions of which are wholly of stone or brick, well
conftrufle J, so as tÂ« be guarded as well as may he
against fires from wkliin, and tree from extra ha
tardous buiklings and their neigh- d!
borhood, will be hazardous of the firft
' olafs, and may be infnred wthekfull vahie.
Also Goods and Merchandise, not of an extra 'jp
hazardous kind, in casks. bales, or package-s, de
pofitcd in ftich buildings, to an amount not ex- _
- caeding 4000 dolhrs ; but if more than this sum fV
- is required to keinfurei in one tenement, an addij
s tional premium will be required, in proportion to â
1 eircumftances. ,< J
11. Insurance* will also be made on buildings aÂ»d ~
J goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
t| to tha risque. But it is not cafy to at-range these
under pirticnlar heads or classes, so as to describe -
each with the necessary accuracy. Each caf* imuft
- therefore be decidSdwpon according to the circum- .
- fiances attending it; and these ciitumftances wili, .
in general, appear from the defcriptioo accompa
r uying the application;
Buildings partly conflruiSfctd of brick or stone,
are preferable to those wholly wooden. And in
both cafe 6, the stile of building, how they are oc
y capied, how they are fituited, the neighboring
bnildings, and how occupied, are confideratious to _
be taken into view. And vdth refye<sl ta goods,
e , their tindsncy, whether frbm their nitarc, or
c, from the manner in which tbey are exposed, either
t- to commence or to in.crease an accidental fire, and
Â»â¢ their liability in such state to receive damage by .
â  s wet, or by sudden andhafly removal, wto be fto-
len in time of confufion and hurry, are all clr-
cumflances of weight j and the premiums must be
d proportioned accordingly.

I- stood by the parties . j u ,

if tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
ie peufes than the payment of tlia premium of the re
d hewed term, the circamftaoces continuing the fame
rj as they were ahdarftood by the Insurers at the time
y the farmer insurance was made ; but the paysncrit
1- of the preniqnk is eflential tft such renewal ; and
d if the party insured! fuffers any time to elapse after -r
i- the expiration of tie former insurance, before he
p, {rays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
1- during such time j sor can the insurance berenew
:h ed on the former policy but by computing the
vb commencemmt of the renewal frÂ»m tbe expiration
6f the former insurance. The fubjeil of insur
e- ance may neverthetefs be open to treaty for a new
