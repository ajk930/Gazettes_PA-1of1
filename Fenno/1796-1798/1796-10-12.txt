M Magn'Jicenl and powerful Lords,
â¢ " 111 confequenee of the resolution sgreed to and
publilSd by your date, refpedling all.the French in
. difciimiiiately, who h*vc taken in yotir cplin
try, several of the heads of families of thtfe unfor
tunate viftimi to their attaehmant to the ancient
laws oT their country, have addrefied themselves to
me, tÂ« obtain the means to repair to England, where
they hope at least to find rcpofe, and afy
ium ajainil the crueky of their persecutor*.
" It is with extreme concern, rtiagnificeht lord#,
that I find myfeif to re'fufe their requelt,.
and to declare to all of tfcem, that 1 cannot grtnt
a paflport to any of them, until I have received or
) derÂ» from my court. 1 think it necefiary, mÂ»gni
ficent lords, to comnunicate to ysu my resolution
upon thiÂ» fubjedt, in ordtfrthat the persons, to whom
it relates, may not be ftifpefled of any neglect or
â  tardiness in obeying the ordinance made refpefting
them. God forbid that, in taking fneh a refolu'i
on, I fcould pretend to set bouiidt to the munifi
cence of my sovereign, or the generosity of his ftlÃ
jedls, which I hope, will exitt as long at rhe monar
chy itfelf. We have always, magnificent lords, a
confidence that our trtrans will by divine
t favour, in propottion at they arc employed in assis
ting the unfortunate.
I " But, it ft my duty, in this unforcfeen cafe, tp
â  take no stepÂ» without having previoully communica
ted to nly court all the circumstances which have
preceded, accompanied and followed this measure,
and intreatcd his majelty to me the moil ditÂ»
tindl orders ft>r the regulation of my condufl in all
that relates to this business.
" I do not hesitate to avoW, that I hsre not been
without hope that the delay which might be caused
1 by my resolution in the execution of the order
against those who have no other afylirm but Eng
-1 land, would have offered to your lordships an op
portunity of confidcring of every mitigating cir
â  comftance, of which this cafe is capable. Perhaps
1 *lfo, this delay may lead those perfbns, who have
1 urged this measure, to think deliberately both upÂ®n
itt nature, and the confcqucnces which may ensue
' e *
t from it.
F " Whatever may be the event, msgnificent lords,
: in adopting and cammunicating this resolution to
: your lordlhips, jf I can be ihe muans of saving any
[ one of those refpeftable families from exhausting
their lad resources, in taking a long and dangerous
voyage, I (hall think that 1 have performed my du
-1 ty to my God and my king ; and I dare answer,
1 that whatever may be the sffeflion and friehdfhip
Vrhith the king, my matter {after the example cf

TbÂ« ambaflador Sweden, to the citizen minister
of foreign affairs.
| " Paris, August 1, 1796.
. " Citizen minister,
r "Itis by the express order of my court, that I
- have the honour to renew, before the direflofy, the
â  fleps I had already taken for the admission of M. de
| Rehaufen, ia the quality of charge d'affaires of his
. majesty tvith the French republic.
1 " Inviting you, citizen minister, to take again
- into consideration, a step so conformable to the good
1 intelligence which fubliftt between the two coun
tries, I beg you will permit me to make fotse ob
fervationt, which I submit to the directory.
" The confidence which friendly & allied powers
reciprocally owe each other, the refpeft which is its
. result, has always been indiftriminately granted to
f the perfoH chosen by his fovercign to repieftnt him
, âit is even inseparable from it. Both have, how
ever) been neglected in the person of bL de Rehau
j ien. His private sentiments can the less give um
- ro e government, as he would ccrtainly fa
. crifice thetfl in tlie e*ercife of his funftiotW) if thev
: eouid be contrary to the inttrudtions he has received,
and if in his conduct or in his language, he could
[ be wanting to the treaty which fnbftlh between
, Sweden and Francc. And it is in this cafe anlyj
, if a mifundcrftanding Ihould take place between the
s two governments, that his recall woula become ne
ceflary. Bnt since this is not the cafe, his sentiments
,â¢ cannot be confrdered as a valid motive of exciufioii,
. and the refufal becomes consequently less an injury
, done to M. de Rehaufen, than a \Va:it of rtfpedl to
â  his fovercign.
y 1 mud likewise remark, that M. de Rchiturtn,
being at Paris, has beeq appointed to attend ad
, interim to the affairs of Sweden, at a time when
a rupture with Roffia was every ieftant cxpetted>
1
! and when the Svtedifh at that comt Â«'J"
on the eve of quitting his post. His appointment
could noc therefore liave been influenced by the
â j emprtfs of Rufiia, to whom lie is otherwise ail ut
ter fit anger.
"It is Â£r>r these renfons, citizen mini Iter, that 1
am unable to attribute to the person of M. de Re
. haufen the refufal of the diredorv to acknowledge
. ~ him in his public character. This refufal appears
evidently to announce the intention of. dikÂ»bliging,
U in lh ( e face of Eurdpe, the mod ancient friend of
France. "1 hesitate to pronounce a mor<; decrfive
fuppofitioir; it is too repugnant to the known withes
of the Swedes and the Ffench, thertifelves, as like
wise to their rcfpefitive and at the fame
time it would be difficult for the enemies of tooth
(countries, not to find great fatisfaition in the dis
union of which the trench republic Btay have given
the signal. It is prescribed to me to declare, that
if M. de Rehaufen be not acknowledged, his raa
jefly will be obliged in support of his dignity, to
use reciprocity with regard to citizen Pcrrochel. I
This ntceffity will othe;rwife hate no influence 'oil
the desire Which his majesty will always havfc, to
ftrenjrthen the bands of friendship and good under
Handing -which ought to exist between the two i
powers.

It appears, by letters from the French generals ;
in Germany, that'general Jom dart is confined by
indispositiOn, and that the commahd of the army '
has devolved on general Kleber, who has obtained 1
fame partial advantages Over the Auftri*ns. The
French, in that quarter, continue to advance, and
the Auftrians to retreaj. The head-quarters of the
latter, when the accounts came away, were near
Donawert on the Danube.
It is fsid that the emperor hasrefolted to confine (
his efforts in future to the defence of his hereditary
dominions, and has sent coVnmiffioriers to negotiate
a treaty with the French.
We are happy in being able to lay, upon the aU- ]
thority of letters from the molt refpeitable raer- 1
charits of Lisbon, that no appiehenfion there is '
entertained frem * 'visit faom the French. The '

The Pantheon l.as undergone a mod complete a!-

y with a variety of new and well finifhed scenery, and

r ving the Chariot of the Sun ; the horses arc well
c executed, and appear, as if animated with all that
II fne and spirit, which have so long been the favorite
e thertie of the poets. The stage doors are neatly
t pannclled in a pink ground, with parterres in the
e centre of each.
ri The roof of the Pantheon is a dome, covered
0 with a profufion of superb paintings, the centre of
e the dome (from tvhich a large chandelier in the
e toim of a bell is suspended by a richly gilt chain) is
a a biilhant piece, reprefentiag the heathen deities,
s Jove is diftovered fitting, and holding in one of his
0 hands the thunderbolt,.and is supported by the A
: merican EÂ«gle, and stripes, &c. See. At the extre
e mity of the dome, and over the boxes, are affixed
s large Lames, representing the gods and goddefTeSj
Â» placed in highly ornamented niches, with all their
t concomitant and vatioHS emblems. Over the chain
of the chandelier aie seen two Cupids with flaming
e torches, represented, as contending who (hould have
, the honor of lighting it. 1
1 Ihe boxes are plain cieled, and painted of alright

the back of the pit and front of the cirrus is richly

with pedestals, which arc conne&ed together by i

either they meditated such an attack, or, what was
more likely, wished to excite an alarm of it in this ~
country. He owned he had heard this, but he did /
not attach much credit to the infotmation. It was
a ruse de guerrt, not incanfiftent with the Ficnch
character; but even if thev /hould attempt to car.

e. Thus, amidst the pain, which he took to dispel
â¢I r f om L , the mindÃ of tlie gentlemen, the apprehension
_ ot th"., new attack upp 3 n our trade, he in fact con-'
:d fe ff d the of the danger by the concession

A proposal has bcen made for calling Dr. Frieif\

to his philofophica! abilities, i, the hope that X}

him by friendfhip, and by a fiiaularity of opinioiÃ|

very little, except account, of the flourifhing state i

Letters from Leghorn of the 14th u!t. state,
the Fregch have still a gar.rifon of 2,200 men in 9
that city ; a former statement ol their having eva- n.
cuated it, is coiifequently untrue. The harbour is
blocked up by a squadron of fix British fiiipsofthc
line. Our navy, by all accounts, is spread from 1
Leghorn as far as Toulon along thc Italian coali,
and does not fuffer a vessel of any nation to enter
any of the Italian harbours. Thc French garri- 1
loft of Leghorn is making preparations of defence,
in cafe the Englilh (hould bombard that port, an
event highly probable, and to aid iB which a great Di
number of gun-bpats arc fitting out in the iUandof Dc
Corsica. Dc
The motive assigned by the French direflory for _
refufing to receive M. de Rchaufen, as Sevvdiih
charge d'affaires, wa,, that they ~-onfidcred him as Do
a spy of the court of Peter/burgh. â  Ra
The reiterated remonftranaes of the Swedifli '^ r
court in favor of this gentleman, prove the infiu-
ence which the court of Russia has gained over that p 0
of bweden, by some late political arrangement,. Do
The duKt regent is tow placed in a strange dilem- iQ
ma on tHis fubjefi. If he yields ts the demands Â®' -
of the dire&ory, he is in danger of committing
himfelf- with Rufiia ; and if on the other hand, he
persists in refufing to appoint any other Swedish 0,3
minister than M. de Rehaufen, a rupture with
France seems unavoidable. It would appear, how
ever, that the directory does not wifii to quarrel OI
with Sweden ; as, in its usual (tile, and in the true E? KS
spirit of French rebellion, it blends with the recal of
of it, minister at Stockholm, the profeflion of its c
affeiSion for the SwÂ«di(h nation, which it carefully urt
diftingui(he, from the Swedish governpnent, in or
der to render the latter odious aud suspicious to thÂ» jof
f9B | people. It ; s however worthy of notice, that
far- I Sweden, which was thefirft European Hate to ac
knowledge the power of the French republicans,
u now likely to feel the venon of the ferpetit (he has
feftered.
hem There has been another diffurbance at Lugo, in
: PÂ°" I,a] y- The inhabitants of this town, which is ii*
Â®"d the dotchy of Ferrara, had attacked a body of 60

cd 6 Angcrrau advanced with a body of .troops, on
hearing this intelligence, and dispersed the inflir
giv- gents by a fsw discharges of cannon loaded with
arid grape thot.
There are now at "Havre, and other French
e Â» ports tn the channel, a number of Americans,
'a> (many of whom have been lately in this coantry,
Â°* in the chara&er Â©f merchants) fitting otÂ»t small
*at row-boat privateers, to interrupt our unarmetkoaft
eri. These boats come out ih the evening, run
'on* immediately over to this shore, and watch their op
portunity to hoard such vessels as they think they
can t*ke. If they meet with Britifti cruizers, or
' armed, vessels, they pass for Englishmen or fifher
