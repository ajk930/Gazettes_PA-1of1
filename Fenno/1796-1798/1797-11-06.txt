/MONDAY EVENING,^-NOrEMSES 6.
For the Gazette of the Unitso Stages.
TO THE PUBLIC.
When I alTmed that the account of Dr.
Ruth's conduit in the year 1793, was falfc
or mifrept*fented, I did not know or fuf
pefl Dr. Carrie to be the author of it. I
have never felt the least un'dndnefs to this
gentleman, nor am I aftuated by rcfentment
in thus publickly refuting his adertions. My
; motives in the preftnt imdertaking are a re-,
gard to truth, and gratitude to my mufch
refpefted friend and preceptor in mcdieine,
whose charjfter has been mod unworthily
traduced in the publication alluded to.
Dr. C u trie's fir ft tfh rge again ft Dr. Rulh,
is as follows :
Information refpefting Dr. Rush's con
duflandtranfa&ions during the prevalence
of the malignant fever of 1793 âCommu-
nicated by one of the members of the col
lege of physicians.
" Dr. Rush having tried the effefts of
mercurial purges which he acknowledged
to the coll* e of physicians on the 26th of
August, had been recommended to him by
Do'ftors Hodge and Carson, the latter of
whom had experienced their good effefts
upon himfelf on a former 6ccafio;i, ih a dose
containing Jo grains <jf calomel, made tri
al of them, and was so highly pleased with
them, that he alTlimed the credit of the dif
eovery, though they had been frequently
employed, both by the East and Weft-India
physicians long before 1793, as may be seen
in *he publications of Lind, Blaney, Clark,
Balfour and others."
To tKis I answer, that Dr. Ru(h began
the-treatment of thÂ« yellow fever by means
of purges of calomel mid saltsâand bleed
ing. These were effeÂ£hial in the cases of
Mrs. Bradford, Mrs. Learning, and Mr. Pal
mer, to whom Dr. R was called on the 6th
7th and 14th of August. Finding them
ineffectual in fotne subsequent cases, he had
recourse to bark, wine, and othef tonic re
medies recommended bv Dr. Stevens. These
proving Slike unfuccefsful he retreated to
the remedies he had began with, but in a
more powerful form. I (hall here give the
doctor's account of the change in his prac
tice from his history of the yellow fever
in 1793.
" I fufpefted that my want of success in
discharging this bile, in several of the cases
â in which I attempted the cure by purging,
was owing to the feeblenefi of my pOrges.
I had been in the habit of occasionally
purging with calomel in bilious and in
flammatory feveri, and had recommended
thÂ». practice the year before in my leftures,
not only from my own experience, but upon
the authority of Dr. Clark. I had more
over, other precedents for its use in the prac
tice Â©f Sir John Pringle, Dr. Cleghorn, and
Dr. Balfour, in diseases of the fame class
with the yellow fever. But these wtre not
| all my vouchers for the fafety, and efficacy
los calomel. In my attendance upon the mi
litary hospitals' during the late war, I had
seen it given combined with jalap in the bil
ious fever by Dr. Thoma# Young, a senior
filrgeon in the hospitals. His usual dose
was ten grains of each of them. This was
given once or twice a day, until it procured
large evacuations from the bowels. Fot a
while I remonstrated with the Doctor against
this purge, as bcirig difproportioned to the
violence and danger of the fever; but I was
I soon fatisfied that it was as fafe as cremor
tartar, or glauber'3 salts. It was adopted
by feveial of the surgeons of the hospital,
and was univcrfally known, and frmetimes
prescribed, by the simple name of tÂ»n and
ten. This mode of giving calomel occurred
to me in preference to any other. The
jalap appeared to be a nccefTary addition to
it, in order to quicken its paflage through
the bowels ; for calomel is (low in its opera
tion, more Â«fpecialJy when it is given in large
doses. . I resolved after mature deliberation,
to prefcribt this purge. Finding ten grains
of jalap inefficient to carry the calomel
through the bowels, in the rapid manner I
wished, I added fifteen grains of the former,
to ter. of the latter ; but even this dose was
flow, and uncertain in its operation. I then
iflued three doses, each confiding of fifteen
grains of jalap, and ten of calomel 5 one to
be given every fix hours until they procured
four or five large evacuations. The effefts
of this powder, not t)nly answered, but far
exceeded my expectations. It perfectly
cured four out of the firft five patients to
whom I gave it, notwithstanding some of
them were advanced several days in ftie dis
order."*
My notes taken from Dr. Rush's public
lectures in the university, and from his pri
vate le&ures to his pupils in the winter of
179a âand early in the- fnmmer of 1793,
bear testimony to the truth of the above re
lation as far as it alludes to the exhibition of
strong mercurial purges in the bilious fever.
These notes are open to the infpeÂ£ticm of
such gentlemen as may wish (o fee them.
In a confutation which Dr. Rush attend
ed with Dr. Hodge and Dr. Foulke, in the
cafe of Mrs. Le Maigre, on the 19th of
August, the day before she died, Dr. Hodge
mentioned that Dr. Carson had taken a
scruple of calomel, by advice ofthe late Dr
William Smith, in a gouty complaint, with
great advantage. Dr. Smith had learned
the fafety and use of larges dose of calomel
from Dr. T. Yonag, in the hospitals, dur
ing the late war, where he served at the fame
time with Dr. Riifh. The prescription, of
course, could not be new to Dr. Rush, al
though it probably might be so to Dr.
Hodge. -It was by reasoning upon the dis
ease that Dr. R. determined to combat it
with the medicine of Dr. Young. After
hehad nfed it with success, he communicated
an account of it on the 3d of September
(and not on the 26th of August, as Dr.
Curria has aflerted) to the college of j>hy
* See pag* 400. JCI. . (
ficians, and urged, as a rcafon for T thcir
adopting it, that upon mentioning the re-'
medy ts Drs. M'llrtiine, Griffitts, Hodge
and Carfoh, he had been happy to find, they
had all been in the use of calomel as well as
himftlf; but nonu of them had used it com
bined with jalapâagreeably to Dr. Young's
prpfcriptfon sânone5 ânone of them had used it in
large and repeated doses, so as to excite a
salivation, as well as to discharge the morbid
contents oP the bowels. In the use of calo
mel, to excite a salivation, Dr. Ru(h stood
alone. Much of the abuse he then experi
enced was for this mode of using it. The
good effeCts of-thus diverting the disease
from the vital parts, by exciting a new ac
tion injhe throat and mouth, have been so
obvious, that this mode of curing the yel
low fever has been adopted by all the phyli
cians in Philadelphia 5 even by those who,
like Dr. Currip, it in the severest
terms in
in the Wtll, and ( Dr. Wade in the Eafl In
dies, adopted a iimilar mode of treating ma
lignant Fivers in the year 1793. But of
this Dr. R. could have no knowledge, as
appears by the honorable testimony which
Dr. Chifholm bears to the practice of Dr.
R. in the following words :
" Since my arrival in England, I have had
peculiar fatisfaCt ion in finding that a treat
ment, nearly pmilar to the above, had been
adopted with great success in the malignant
pestilential fever, which so fatally prevailed
at Philadelphia during the autumn of 1793.
Dr. Rush's medical talents and merit aie too
well known and top generally acknowledged
to require the feeble efforts of my pen to
extol them. If any thing, however, could
add to the excellence of this gentleman's
character, it must be his benevolent exer
tion, and .unwearied perseverance during the
txiftencc of thij dreadful calamity, in re
lieving his helplcfs and afflicted fellow-citi
zens, and in pursuing the mercurial mode of
treatment, with the height of prejudice and
malignity in opposition to him. Such fortitude
is rarely met with in the medical profefTion ;
and whÂ«n ft is, it must feeure our admira
tion and refpeCL" &c, âSeep. 275. 6.
It may not be amiss to add here, that in
no ft age of the disease did Dr. Hodge sali
vate his patients in 1793 ; that he continu
ed to employ bark and wine with his mode
rate doses of calomel, and he was one
of the most inveterate enemies of Dr. R's
praftice. I /hall ask tooâwhy, if D r - H.
discovered the use of calomel, wis Dr. Ru(h
loaded with such insult .and abufc as he ex
perienced ?âAnd why did not Dr Hodge,
at that time step forward to share in the abuse
to which Dr. R*i<h had exposed himfelf ?
Ii Dr. Currie had refrefhed his memory
by reading his firft pamphlet on the yellow
fever, before lie fat down to villify Dr. R.
lie would have found an acknowledgment of
his having derived the use of calomelânot
from Dr. Hodgeâbut from one of the au
thors to whom Dr. Rush haÃ expressed his
obligations, viz. Dr. Clarke. 'Tis ftrangt !
' hat Dr. CurriÂ« should profit by his reading,
ind not allow the fame privilege to Dr.
Rush !
Dr. Currie proceeds by aflerting, " He
appears to have read Dr. Mofely's directi
ons for treating the yellow fever of the Weft
Indies, about the loth of September for
the firft time. In that treatise very profufe
and frequent bleeding is recommended, from
a persuasion that the disease was always at
tended with inflammatory symptoms in the
beginning, which in that climate was pro
bably the cafe, as the fubjeas that came
under Mofely's car* were flrong, vigorous,
plethoric English sailors." The infinuaticn
which Dr. Currie has made that Dr. R.
had read Dr. Mofely for the firft time about
the 10th of September, is unfounded and
malevolent. Dr. R. was possessed of Dr.
M.'s book long before the disease appeared
in Philadelphia.:âhe was minutely ac
quainted with it, and had alwavs considered
him aa. an author of tea great refpeSability
and merit, not to put it into the hands of
his students among the firft works upon
acute and tropical diseases. His practice
of bleeding was iu part derived from this
excellent author. It is true he did not
bleed generally in the month of Au{juft,
or in the beginning of September. The
disease during the hot weather, coufifted,
as in the Weft Indies, of but one or two
paroxysms, apd yielded to one or two copi
ous purges. After the weather becam*
copl, the fever protraCted itfelf into three,
four, and five paroxysms, and then it be
came ncceflary to combat it \yith the lancet
is well as with purging medicines. The
extraordinary success of ftfong mercurial
purees in this fever during the hot weather,
will not surprise those who are familiar with
the Weft praCtice. Mr. Brice tells
us that in a warm latitude, on board thÂ«
Bufbridge Indiaman, he loft but three out
of 2jo patients whom he treated with mer
curial purges only, without bloodletting.
Dr. Pennington declared oti'his death-bed,
that of 48 patients to whom he had given
the mercur.al purges (without bleeding) he
had loft none. He declared further, that
he had saved.no one to whom he had given
bark and wine. Ido not hesitate to vouch
for the truth of Dr. Rush's afiertion, in
his letter to Dr. Rodgers, respeCting the suc
cess of his practice in the early stage of the
disease, after he had adopted the depleting
remedies. It was my happiness to witness
and share in the triumph which those reme
dies produced over that formidable disorder.
The diminution of his success after his sick
ness, was owing to causes which havf been
explained at full length in his treatise on the
yellow fever of 1793. The chief cause, I
well remember, was the publications a gain ft
those remedies; and of those publications,
such as came from the pen of Dr. Currie
had the most mischievous effeCts.
Dr. Currie has afTerted, in language not
very consistent with that of a person who
wished " to brigg to an issue the question,
so interesting to the community, relative to
the most fuccefsful method of treating the
malignant fever which has infefted and o<;-
cafionol such depiprable mortality in differ
ent sea-port towns of Awerica, since the
year 1793," " DÂ°Â£tÂ°r here re
membered to forget the information he for
merly acknowledged he had received from
Dodtors Hodge and Carson, refpjicting. the ,
efficacy of mercurial purges ia bilio&s cases. '
He a'fo remembered to forget having fcen !
the good effedta produced by bleeding a fat i
cook in Water-street, the day after he had j
threatened to prosecute Dr. Barnwell for a
design upon the life of Mrs; Rofs in Wal
nut-street, because he bled her in the very
fame kind of fever that tye now applauds it
in, and employs as a .cordial and anodine,
and in desperate cases, to make the patient
die easy. He alfu remembered to forgtt to
mention, that he adopted his faagvinary
code not from Draco but from Mofely, who
was a mere empiric that praCtised in Jamaica ,
some years ago." In thehot weather, Dr. :
Ru(h considered bleeding as â 
He had cured hnudreds without it. Dr.
Barnwell had visited Mrs. Rofs at this time
â  without Dr. Rush's knowledge, on the 4th
or sth day of her disease, afid had bled
her beyond that time in which it is common
.to begirt the use of that Remedy. She died
soon afterwards. It is pollible, that had
fhÂ« been bled at an earlier period, she might
have recovered, as the disease was then
tending, from a change in the weather, to
more than one or two paroxysms. Dr.
Rush complained of Dr. Barnwell's con
duct, and threatened, if he again interfered
with his praCtice, to complain of him to
the Mayor of the city. The latter part of
this paragraph I (hall notice hereafter.
In Dr. Currie's quotation of Dr. Rush's
directions to the citizens of Philadelphia,
he has introduced the word his inflead of
the, alluding to the remedies he employed.
I (hall introduce the firft part of the direCti
ons as Dr. C. has given them, and re
qucft those who are anxious to fee how differ
ent they are from the original, to refer !
either to the Federal Gazette, or to page
227 of Dr...Rush's treatise on the yellow
fever.
",0n the 12th September he publilhed in
the Federal Gazette the following directi
ons to the citizens :
" Dr. Rush, regretting that he is unable
to comply with all the calls of his fellow-ci
tizens indisposed with thÂ« prevailing fever, j
recommends to them to take his mercurial '
purges, which may now be had with fnit
able directions at most of the apothecaries,
and to lofe.ic or 12 ounces of blood as soon
as convenient after taking the purges," &c.
" How far the assertions contained in the
address correspond with fafts, let the obi
tuary of that month determine, and the
deaths in his own family."
This perversion in the 6fe of a word
strongly indicates Dr. Currie's difingenuily.
In no one instance, and as no time did Dr.
Rush call them his remedies.- He constant
ly ascribed them to Dr. Young, Dr. Mofe
ly, Dr. Balfour and Dr. Clarke ; and as
far as they related to purging and bleeding
â¢without mercury, he ascribed them with e
qual modesty to Dr. Hillary, Mitchell and
others. >
In Dr. Currie's attempt ta refute tht ac
count of Dr. Rush's success, he mentions
the " obituary of that month and the deaths
in his own family," I shall hereafter notice
the firft part and shew that Dr. Currie ought
to have been the last person in the world to
mention any thing in allusion to the mortaÂ»
lity of that period. As to the 2d part, all
I have to fay isâthat coftfidering the labor,
distress, want of deep, and constant infec
tion from crowds of sick people, to which
J)r. Rush's family was exposed ; it was
more extTSSfiigary that any of them survi
ved, than that anyoftktgi died of the di
sease. Let any one consult tb* narrrative
which Dr. R. has gi*en at the ct<jfej>f his
3d volume, and they must be convinceafit
once of the truth of this observation. In
replying to this paragraph, I am disposed
to ask whether Dr. Currie be a human be
ing, and whether he has ever felt the tiesof
brother or of friend ? If he meant to wound
Dr. Rush by remioding-him of the loss of a
most beloved lifter, who gave her life to save
hi 3, and of the death of his amiable pupils,
he has been fully gratified. I have witnefled
the silence and indifference with which Dr.
Rush has treated all the calumnies which
have lately been published against him ; but
the cruel /haft which reminded him of his
deep afflictions in 1793, did Â»ot fall like ma
ny others bhinted to the ground. This
reached his heart ! Enjoy then Dr. Currie,
I repeat it again, enjoy the misery you have
inflided by that merciless stroke ! But may
you never experience any thing like it.
Dr. Currie proceeds as follows in his a
buse of Dr. Rush.
" Immediately after one of his addresses
to the citizens, the following advertisements
were published at his requefl in all the news
papers.
" Dr. Rush's celebrated mercurial purging
and sweating powders for preventing and cu
ring the prevailing putrid fever, may be had
carefully prepared, with proper directions
at Betton and Harrifon's, No. 10, South
Second street.
Dr. Rush's mercurial sweating purge for
the yellow fever, may be had carefully pre
pared with the doCtor's directions, and fold
by William Delany, druggist and chemist,
&c.
Dr. Rush's mercurial sweating powder for
the. yellow fever, with printed direCtions,
prepared and fold by permission, by GoklÂ«-
thwait and Baldwin, chemists and druggiftg,
&c."
By this assertion which is moft,unequivo
cally falfe, it would seem that Dr. Currie
willies to make it appear that Dr. R. parti
cipated in the gains of the apothecaries, who
prepared and fold those remedies. 'Tis e
vident this must be the motive, as otherwise
the advertisements are certainly by no means
censurable. Be that as it may, I shall re- j
fer to Dr. Rush's 3d vol. p. 204, 5, where
he speaks of his inability to comply with ,
the demands for those powders ; notwith
standing he had the assistance of 5 pupil;,
together with his mother, (jfter, in 4 two
other, persons. This thfn. was the reason of
his furnithing the apothecaries with the reci- '
pe and dirediions, witlj the benevolent wifll
of rendering them more extensively ufeful to
his filffering fellow-citizens. Whilst those
men were daily making immense sums
by the sale of those powdery Dr. R. re
ceived but one dollar and an half, which was
.given to one of his pupils by some
who called for them. Many. pounds of Ja
lap and Calomel were ifined from his (hop,
and by far the greiteft part was given to tht
poor. â¢ *
Dr. Currie has asserted, that Dr. Rush
assumed the " discovery" of the use of calo
mel and bloodletting in the yellow fever.
From what has been said, it-appears that no
fitch honor was ever claimed by Dr. Rush.
He introduced them only into practice lft
Philadelphia. All his publications both in
th? newfuapers in 1792, and in his treatises
on the yellow fever, hcrld forth no other iijea..
The reader may be fatisfud of the truth of
this aflertion by confuting the Federal Ga
zette of 1793, of September 11, 12, lÂ£,
I4a;>d 19, and every part of Dr. Rufli'g
wonks where those remedies are mentioned.
I cannot help noticing here the inconsist
ency into which Dr. Cnrrie has been betiay
ed by his want of memory. In one of his
publications in the Federal Gazette of the
20th September, 1793, he afcribts the de
pleting practice to Dr. Rush.; and at the
fame time reprobates it as " iewf certain
death" in the yellow fever. In his preface to
his 2d pamphlet, he ascribes it. to the col
lege of physicians. These rr; his words :
" He (meaning himfr'f) however doÂ»s not
pretend to have been the improver of the.
treatment, of the discoverer of the means
most effeftual in the cure, whi.ch is recofri
mended in the following p:iges. On the
; contrary, he believes they were adapted fmnj
; the joint deliberations of the college of phvfi
. cians." In the publication rran-
Cderation, he ascribes it to Dr. Hodge and
others. To which of these publications
(hall we tioiv give credit ?

Remarkable refesnblances between the ty
rants jf '93 arid the empen r Caracalla!
" Caracalla at firft held, conjointly with
! his brother, the reins of the Roman empire ;
their fouls were equally feiocious. Jealousy
sos power delayed not to divide them. 'Ge
ts was immolated. Pofterityhasfhut itseyeson
| his vices, feeing him only as aviftim ; but his
tory observes that if he had anticipated his
! brother, the world would not thereby have
been less unhappy."
Who overturned Robefpicrre ? His an- '
cient friends, the accomplices of allhis crimes.
Why did they bring him to the fcaffold ?
To reign in his place ? Why were there .a
mongthemen who figured in the march of ther
midorien justice, so many who entered, and
who enter every day the ranks of BabceuT ?
Because they perceived that justice excluded
the ambitious, and that having no other title
to public confidence than ambition .and
crimes, it was their interest to exclude and
proscribe virtue.
" The crime of Caracalla, fays hiftery,
did not remain unpunished ; neither plea
sures nor flattery could rid him from the
rending remorses of a guilty conscience : ihe
stern countenance of his father, and the
bloody ghost of Geta, would often present
themselves to his troubled imagination : but
his remorses only prompted him to extermi
nate every thing that could recal his crime
and the remembrance of his affilfTwated
brother."
How many terrible applications could we
rist niake here I but our readers will ejfily
supply tiitfa, *
" Caracalla put to death twenty thou
sand persons of both sexes, under the vague
pretence that they had been friends to Geta;
it was fufficient to have had the least con
nexion with him, to weep for his death,
even to pronounce his name, to be guilty of
high treafou."
Thus our revolutionary tyrants put to
death every one who had any relation, either
with the proscribed of the ancient govern
ment, or with the proscribed of the 31ft
May.
" Caracalla for a very flight offence, con
demned to death the inhabitants, generally,.
of Alexandria, in Egypt ; stationed in a
secure place in the temple of Serapis, he or
dered and beheld whh a barbarous pleasure,
the massacre of many men, citizens and fo
reigners, without paying any regard to the
-number of these unfortunates, or the nature
of their offence."
Unhappy cities of Lyons, of Bedouin,,
and of Toulon ! this is without doubt, the
model which yosr demolilhers and affafiini
had before their eyes. More barbarous even;
than Caracalla, they arc not contented to
drink the blood of your inhabitants, they
have destroyed your edifices and your fine it
monuments.
" Caracalla carried his fury throughout
the empire. Each province became in*its
turn the theatre of his rapines and his enti
ties."
We wifll that the limits of this pa
would permit us to present to our readers
the pi&ure of the bloody marches of this
montter, they would find in it the hiftery
ef our uroconfu's. i
" Calumny was the favourite weapon â¢ of
Caracalla."
But however able he was in managing; it,
if he was to come to life again, he would
with pleafurc take lessons from Poulticr and
his friends.
" Caracalla declared waragainft the whole
world."
Is it not what we have done, is lit not
what we still do in France ?

Accounts by the Elefta arrived yesterday me
from Leogane state, that the (hip Andro
mache of this port, lately taken by a French to
privateer and carried into St. Domingo, ha 3 ,Â°f
been releasedâand, as is said, in confe
cuence of a late decree and order received the
from France. r "5
It rnnch to be hoped this information of

PORT WINE.
The orders received at Oporto this 'year
are for no more than 11,000 pipes, of which
goc'o are for England, Ireland, a:jd Scot- j
land, and the reft for otl.er parts of Europe. 1
In the year 1794, the exports amounted to n â
52,000 pipes. There is therefore,.a fall- 1'
ing-off, reacliing nearly to four-fifths of the j Mi
whole quantity. The last fleet has brought ;
only 3500 pipes for the port of London cr?
The imports for the whole of this kingdoi* w i
does not exceed 5000 pipes. I eft
The Methuen treaty, concluded in 1703,'
between England and Portugal, while it
ftipulate3 for an abatement of one third of
the duty on the wines of Portugal, imported <j e
into jhis country, does not contaip any arti- the
cle binding to admit the manufactures of PÂ°
England on better terms than those of any
other nation. The late treaty with France, f QI
therefore, which puts the republic on the ku
fame footing in point of commerce as Great- fui
Britain, cannot be said to be in any degree bo
injurious to us*; but merely declaratory of j o |

.Translatedfor the Daily Advertifcr. _
An addrefs.from the Merchants at Havre de
Grace to the Legislative Assembly. w
Citizens Representatives, |.bi
We have a long time addressed ourselves th
to Heaven with ardent vows for a re-eftab- '
liftltnent of peace, without which it is im-
pofliblc that the commerce of France (hould
he reftqred. Calumny in vain haS accused j n
the legislative body,to bring to remembrance th
its happy tera. It is well known with what Â£
tagernel's th. -preventatives of the people
have ratified the differed treaties wh.ch the fc
Diredteyy has submitted to the:i" C?rr. it y,
< is not our delign to destroy the dark ten
Machiavelian policy, which has various times v
cither broken or stretched out the links of
negociation. May the two powers, united ot
with principles and intentions, acceleiate f 0
the general peace.
But as the demon of war still continues
,to assassinate us with his impure breath, it
is neciiffarythat our present situation (hpuld a ,
be contidered. tl:
. Neutral nations alone poffcls our exterior ig
commerce; without those we (houldl be in
want of the greatest necessaries. Within y
two years they have filled our ports and
brought in plenty. The French have lent
their flag, by which they have peaceably
navigated every sea. ti
Our allies, the Americans, had preferv- t!
Ed them every reciprocal advantage of our y
treaty of friendftiip of 1778. AH our mar- ']
itime rules were wounded befsre this solemn I
contrast. The. tribunals have never thole d
laws which were made for them, as a rule t
â for their decifiont. Since the commence- p
ment of the war, government has never or- c
dained that they (hould be blended with the v
other neutral 1
At length denounced by 1
citizen Pal Wet, of the 12th V-n- ,
tofe, as being unconptutional, appeared \
without being submitted to you; and as ,
soon a* a swarm of privateers had .alien up- 1
on American veflels, without even sparing ]
those bound to France, we have prevent- ,
Â«d their navigation; we have brought them ]
into our ports; they have been had before 1
the Tribunal; where they have: been denoun- ,
ced as being under the disguise of Engltlh;
they have been declared as legal prize, not
because their.papers did not prove their neu
trality ; but, because they had not the Role
d'Equipage.* . .
Nevertheless the Americans arc only
bound to (hew a passportâwe have never
seen them in our ports with a Role, becaule
that was never regarded as of utility. In a
word they have been confifcafted under a for
mal pretext, Â»to which every other nation
has. been constantly fubjeft, and in which
tb<y have cier bteu exculpated.
I Citizen representative;!, it is time to put a E
stop to this disastrous abuse of trade, for it h
is easy to prove to you,that thefeAmericans, h
which the pirates call English, are friends ai
who carry to France provisions which belong ft
not only to neutral nations, but even to the o
French. Therefore the pirates whS dare o
address you with petitions in the name of h
the merchants of our ports, who secret them- iÂ«
selves, have the audacity to pillage the pro- C
perly from our citi zens, or at least from ti
their good friends. The result of these pi- tl
ratical tranfaftions will be, that we dial) be fa
deprived of their assistance. ai
These corsairs, who the name of ! ce
fitting out veflels, and of being merchants, fft
are no other than vile aggreflors against com- i at
merce, for the honest merchants have refufed ee
those kind of voyages since piracies have ft
become the trade. di
The reason why a drtad is spread atriong ai
the commercial people is, tfia't the' English : tf
iir/agine we force the friendfliip of the Ame- j ai
ricans, and that neceflity inclines us to otlier ' fc
neutrals, who begin to follow our example, j 01
They stop every, neutral veflel they meet ; ' bi
they seize their cargoes, and confifcate up- : ai
on the (lighted suspicion those vfhich are w
bound to France. The EngliSi frigates jTa
which block -Â«up our ports, drive off the > p
greater part of neutral veflels which come in- 1 ai
to our bays. If we persevere in our (yftem jee
ofinjuftice ngainft the Americans, we might j c;
expÂ«& the Englifli would imitate us against ; 01
others, and we (hould be exposed to the ! F
want of every thing, and the French com- ja*
merce would be totally I w
If your commifllon is not yet in readiness p
to report on the decree of 12 Ventofe,we beg ti
of you, citizen* representatives, as an urgent d
and eflcntial matter, provilionally to suspend j ri
the falcs and proceedings against the Ame- ] g
ricans. This plan will not injure the right j U
of p 1 ivateers, if any there are, if there arc- , o
none, (he wili dispose of the public trÂ«afure ft

may hÂ»ve been repeated against the Ameri- h

p- to plundering, burning and destroying the

in fore moll heartily congratulate them, for

ie bite of Leogane, after eroding the moun
ts tains of St. Domingo : when Mr. G. left

Â£- be done, on account of the market being
:d glutted, from the number of American vef
>e fels, tound to English, Spanish or French
>y ports, taken by French and Spanish cruis
e- ers, brought into the above port, and declar
er ed good prires. Mr. G. during his (lay of
:i- fourteen days at Gonaives, was daily a wit
ness to the sale of American vefftls and car
y> goes, eight out of ten of whom were taken
n- bound to French ports ; he heard wth pain
if- the sale of those vessels, the day previous,
announced to the town by the public cryer ;
the pretext for condemning those vessels is
â a- a want of papers, which the captains of pri
vateers take care to" destroy the instant they
[J- b'card a vessel. During his day at the
nd Cape, the brig Sophia, capt. Baily, arrived
of there from Porto Ricoâ(he is a brig in the

sat the Weft-Indies to aflift our poor unfortu
â¢be r.tte countrymen, a number of Whom, after
â¢ having had their vessels tafcen from them,
' the captain informed Mr. G. he found lan
guishing in jails, and without money or S!<
friends : on capt. Baily's arrival at the
Cap*', he immediately made application to Sn
the French commiflioners, Pascal and Ray
mond, for the state of AtVn-rican seamen at Br
the Cape ; capt; B. told Mr. G. that after Sc
having made known to the above citizens Sic
the purport of his million, they treated him
with the ntmoft ;nfolencc and contempt,
from which treatment he had vary little .to Ba
expeft ; he intended to fail in a few days' Sit
for St. Jago in Cuba. An immediate war
with America, was viTy generally spoken of
in St. Domingo, when Mr. G. left that Sic
place, and from the-conduft of every indi

hostile in tcntions were'eafily difctrned. The Ri
change in their corr.miffioners, from Santho- i6tl

vessel experienced a most dreadful gale of*
wind in the latitude of Bermudas; fhemadc L
the Weft Caycoson the 19th' Sept. where th
(lie wa3 boarded by the Briliih frigate
Thames, and although bound for a French
port, permitted to depart without one hour's
detention ; (he was again boarded by the
Pel 1 an Br'tifh f!o >p of war, of the Mole,
and treated as before. The Somerset's wa- w:
ter being spoiled on the paflage, the capt. of 2C
the (loop supplied him with good water ; di
during the examination of our papers, the ns
lieutenant informed Mr. Giles, that the Pe- lc
lican had had a very severe engagement with df
I the French armed brig the Trompeufe, a la
I few days before, they were of the lame m
' force, which lafled one hour and twenty mi- re
[ nutes, at which time the French brig, from w
the quantity of {hot received in her hull, lo
funk. The Somerset, on aceojut of head |Ol
winds, was dÂ«tained fix -days in the Bite of 2<
Leoganeâ(he was boarded off the Platform IS
by two brigand boats, under French com- tl
millions ; those boats Mr. G informs, were K
manned by not less than fifty pirates, black, f{
white and yellow, not one of whom could be i
compared, with refpeft to appearance, with
tht word of our wheel-barrow men , the on- le
ly arms 011 board these boats were, in one
a small swivel, and in the other an old rusty t<
musket ; they all however, wore daggers in
their belts ; we could hear them coming at
a great distance, the noise of their oars keep- n
ing concert with the most savage yell; their
firft salutation was a (hot immediately at us I
from their swivel, and the words, " heave I
too you damned rascals j" when they came <
along fide, they all boarded the schooner,
entered the cabin, and began eating, drink
ing, destroying and Healing every thing
they could lay their fingers on ; mothing
could bear a stronger resemblance to a feaft
of savage canibals, than the one Mr. G.
was then witness to ; they kept forcible
poffeflion of the fcheoner for 12 hours, after
which time, having destroyed almost every
thing, and fearing a visit from the Britifli
from the Mole, they left us to continue
our course to Gonaives.
