sin,
Having been recently retfored from the brink of
the grave, by your invaluable medicine, I think it
aty duby to mak ' this public acknowledgment of
the Cmk, far the benefit of others affli&eu with a ,
flmilar complaint. I had been afflicted with a moil Â£
dreadful allhma for abfcut twenty-three years. 1
never for years got any reft, my cough was so
jreuWefome in the night; and used to discharge an In
almost incredible quantity' of glutinous matter oc
Com my Jungs ; and my breath was so exceeding g<
fliort that I could not walk atr-efs my room. Pro- to
videntially hearing of your Cough Drops, I too, in
them ; and, through taking them alone, lam now th
blaffed be God ! restored to perfeft health. My as
cafe is wall known to the members of the EbeDe- ai
zer Chapel, in Lincoln's-Inn-Field, of which 1 a/m w
also a member ; and any of them will glaily Ca
tiasy any inquiry concerning the truth of what 1 [t

r ' Tie following SjX">' of Mr. BitrAt-D, <â¢Â«*-
';i vtrtd on Monday tit 11 f"A " ta jff
I from a mire crreffnote than the one fll
,- ; hjbed in our Paprr of Thrfdny /off
Mr. Baya R Â» fa-d. the fubjed of
the prefpnt debate had been so much exhauÃ
' ' tdbt theaifcMffio" Â«Â» had Â»ndergÂ«ne, that
Z â  it wtfuld be difficult to touch any of the
,11 points of co.trotfrty tfitftout repeating
!Â« Something' of tbt remarks s ot^ ent > e "
-men If,' however, he (hould offend m this
v refpeÂ«, he (houti expefl at lÂ«ft the chanty
ie of tbofe who were guilty of the fame tranf
* greffioD. He thought itneceffary inthe hrtt
Â° [ place to take dotice of the declaration of the
crrnfltman frcra Virginia, the parent of the
, amendment, that he did not design that the
â r measure he proposed, should have an imme
o diate effeft upon our establishment of foreign
rf ministers, but intended OHly to introduce a
J principle whicli fhouldhave a.future operati
; on at a convenient time. If the gentleman
o were fin cere m that declaration, it niuft ne
cessarily follow, that he did not comprehend
h the effeft of his own amendment. For it
' would beremembered that thebill by its own
8 limitation was to continue in force but two
:r years, and if the gentleman's objedt were so
0 distant as he expressed, it cauld certainly
r with no propriety find place in a law so short
â is its duration as the present. It had been
said that the thi.-d feftion of the bill would
0 admit of amendment so Â»sto make proviGon
'â¢ for the ministers already appointed;the com-
mittee would obfery* that the third fectioa
was merely it general appropriation of a gross
ie ftnn, and that t&fcfWft to ; which the
'amendment wa9 proposed, was thcone which
_ prefcribed-the manner id which the money
should be applied. I fin the present fe&ion
according to the amendment it {hould be fix
ed that the salaries of ministers plenipoten
,f tiary (hould be allowed only to our ministers
d at Paris and London, it would be immateri
e al what fun was appropriated in the third
feftion, as theje would be no power in the
1 Executives pay the salaries of ministers ple
nipotentiary to our ministers at Lisbon Mad
rid or Berlin even for the current year. He
apprehended that the gentleman from Vir
ginia had been led to his declaration on this
head from brifig pressed with the objedrion,
that if this hoiife afted as he proposed they
would in effeft revoke cxifting. commissions
which had been granted t>y the President.
Some gentlemen affelted to consider the
constitutional right of this house to inter
j fere in the present cafe as not questionable.
A gentleman from Pennsylvania' had stated '
a (bong cafe in order to prove the necessity
of the power belonging to this house. Sup
pose he laid, the President were to appoint
one hundred foreign ministers, would this
house be bound to appropriate for their fup
gJ fallacy
l e power in the executive, which the const;
t- tion does not fuppofe,bct ofi the contrary,
I s presumes thatthe ftrft magistrate will execute
( j his trust with fidelity. But let us consider
ic -the cafe in an opposite ppint of view. Let
it be imagined that this country has a mif
j understanding with some foreign power, and
that the agency of a minister is indispensa
bly necessary to terminate the difference with
out hostility; ta this end, suppose a minister
, appointed by the Executive, and the house
refufe to appropriate for his support. In
this cafe it is plain the power of appointing
a miniftei is taKen from the Executive by
1 this house, though expressly given to' it by
the constitution. The supposition of an a
buse of power if admitted as an argument
and carried to its extent, goes to the deftruc
{ tion of all power; because there is not and
cannot be a power lodged any where, which
is not capable of abuse. Wc might as well
suppose the cafe that the Prefideut fhouldap
point a chimney ftfeeper chief justice of the
supreme court, and then a(k whether this
house would be bound blindly to appropri
ate for his salary. yhecoiiflrtution has trust.
Ed the President as welf'as it/has trusted this
house: the people confide in his discretion
as well as ia that: of the house : and it is no
better argument to juftjfy our usurping ex
r ecu'tite authority that the Prelident may a
, biffc it,' than it vtould be in favour of his
a (fuming legislative power, because it might
be abused by this body.
The appointment and employment of fo
reign agents, from the very nature of our
government belongs to the Executive. This
house has no foreign relations, its only con
nections ore the people on one hand the dif
ferent branches of government on the other,
the conftitntion has not given to it organs
to discern the cases in which foreign agency
is necessary. It has charged the Executive
with the care of the nation in refpeft to the
tranfaftions of foreign powers. The Presi
dent is responsible for the fafety of the coun
try; if he should negleft to give us notice of
our danger from the designs and preparati
ons of foreign powers, he would be answer
able for the neglett. But on this house no
such responsibility rests: and fliall the houff
take front him the means of gaining infor
mation, and theii hold him chargeable for.
the want nf it:
But withduf ; decidisT the point, how far
it lscompetefltforthe-houfe, on constitutional
principles to interfere in th? cafe, there can
be no difficulty in faying, it would not be
expedient for them to do so, at this time.
Atrbaffadors have been ftj'ed by some grave
writers, honorable spies, placid near t > a fo
reign gcvernir.ent to watch its operations,
and to communicate to their own goveru
, went the earlicft inforrv.tion of any proceed
ings which threaten the peace or fafety of
their country. If at any period of time these
spies were necessary, the present state of Eu
rope rendered their eqjplovment indifpeui'a
ble. Surely, when e-vtry principle of anci
ent order is or;rthrowi!j when the nileswhich
nations and individuals were governed by are
no longer regarded, when a fyttem of the
most wicktdand is introduc
ed, when principle and right no longer set
bounds- to power, and independent nations
are uifpofed of by right of the f*vord, it
behoves this government to search with more
than common vigilance and industry into the
designs of powers. Do <u>e
know at this mnmsnt, but these fates are the
fubjeft of foreign negotiation; that the sword
is to cut us into pieces, and lhat we are to t*
dijlributed ps malce weights in the fcaies of conji
penfation? He trusted therefore, it would
be generally thought that this was not tKc
time to talk of recalling our mmfiVrs t'roiji
abroad. The government needs, the fafety
of the nation requires, the best and ipeeidi
eft communication of the schemes of Euro
pean policy.
But some gentlemen are of opinion that
it would te for the interest of the country
to withdraw all our foreign ministers from
Europe, and dissolve the diplomatic connec
tion which at present exists; they conceive
wc have nothing to do with the politicks of
Europe, which expose us to embarrafTments
without promifingany advantage. He said
he might possibly agree with those gentle
men if their objedt could be accomplished
with the facility they imagined. It might
be an easy thing for the United States to re
solve to have no intercourse with Europe,
but can they determine that the governments
of Europe (hall have no views upon them ?
We may avoid fending public ministers or
private agents to Europe, but can we pre
vent Europe from fending them here? We
may have no interest in interfering in Euro
pean politicks, but have they no interest to
interfere in ours: there is no danger from
the views of this country upon Europe, nor
from our fending ministers or agents tWe,
but the danger to be apprehended is from the
designs of Europe upon America, and the
evils we have felt, have arisen from (he in
trigues of foreign agents, not invited, but
imposed upon thecountry. It is idle to talk
about dissolving all conneftion with Europe;
while the ocean is passable there must be a
connexion. He (hould leave it to the vain
declamation of theorists to deprecate the
consequences of this intercourse; but he
(hould irtfift, that nothing was left to us,
but to regulate it in futh a manner, as to a
void its dangers, and secure its benefits: to
this purpose he apprehendedtheemployment
of ministers abroad was essentially necessary.
But is has been urged that the danger of
executive patronage (hould induce us to re
strain the* power of appointing ministers.
This point had been ably handled by other
gentlemen, but in addition he would remark
that in his opinion that so far was the exer
cise of the power of conferring offices in
this country from multiplying the friends
of the President, that he conceived it in
creased the number of his enemies. That
in gratifying one with an appointment, he
disgusted twenty with a refuiaL
Geatlemen have talked ljnueh about
checks. He believed what they said upon
finccre. He believed they
were dii"nÂ«râ>Â»- â¢ Â«â¢â¢â¢â¢- - â¢
the executive, until they flopped the wheels
of government. And when he is manacled
and at the mercy of the views
will be accomplished, and they will be fat
isfied. For his part, he thought the exec
utive the infirraeft part of the government,
and that if the constitution was in danger,
it was from its weakness. It is not a con
stitutional idea, that this house is to check I
the President,,- but on the contrary, the
President is placed as a check upon the le
gislature. The reason is plain. The au
thority of the President is defined. Its pre
rogatives are all fpecified. The executive
walk is clearly marked out. It is thus the
constitution effedually checks him. And"
he cannot tranfgrets the limits of his au
thority, without its being palpable to the
eyes of the world. The legislative power
was of a different nature, its field was infi
nitely larger, andi tÂ£e bounds of it not dif
cernable with the fame precision. It w'as
necessary, therefore, to prefvrve the execu
tive, that its powers should in fqme degree,
be shecked by h;s. The gentleman seemed
to imagine, that no disposition to uforp
power could exist in Any branch of the go
vernment, but the executive. Gentlemen
confutted very little the esprit du corps and
the spirit of ambition ever found in popu
lar bodies, in making their conclusion. He
affirmed it was in the nature of a body like
that house to be more ambitious of an en
largement of its power, than an executive
defined like that of ours. The breath of
that house could cast down a President at
any moment, and (hould he trench upon
the legitimate power of the house; his ruin
would be inevitable. Eut rthat can the
President do, if we encroach upon his au
thority ? If the house were determined he
nauft submit with the indulgence possibly of
a feeble remonstrance. It was felt as a
truth that even a minority of this house
can (hake the very foundations of execu
tive power. He was firmly persuaded
the danger which threatened the constitu
tion, was not from the President but from
that house. *
Gentlemen had compared the patronage
of this executive to the patronage of the
crown of Great-Britain ; they might as
well compare the strength of Calvin Phil
lips, to that of the Ir;(l? ginn h . In this coun
try how far did patronage extend ? We
had an army difperfedoverthe United States
of 3 or 4.0C0 men : a navy cf three fri
gates ; a number of coile&ors aud supervi
sors, whose salaries were fufficient to give
them bread. How was the ease in Eng
land. An immense army ; a prodigious na
vy wealthy eftablidiments in the church ;
innumerable posts of honor and profit in .the
law ; an unlimited power of creating no-I
bihty, and of conferring titles and rank ; 1
i and, in addition, an allowance for a civil
lift of near amillion iter", a year. Can any
rational companfon be made between an in
fluence flowing from these sources of pow
i er, and the patronage of our executive.'
An executive whof*^,

Before he concluded he would be-J eavc
to fay a word on the fubjedt of the appoint,

The gentleman from PennfyWania had in
finuated that when the gentleman appoint,
ed advocated the appropriation for a rninif

the place was designed for himfelf. This
insinuation was repelled by direst proof â¢
and the gentleman from Pehnfylvania had
since fa id that his charge was notagainft
the minister but the President. The ap
pointment, fays the gentleman, is uncon
stitutional. He thought thatafter the fcru.
pulous delicacy with which the President
construed the constitution, in a ease where
a personal interest presented itfelf, a charge
of this kind ought not to be rathly made.
The constitution difqualifiej a member of Â»

where I remained more than, a year, and a J
half, and I speak of his aid and friend/hip- 1
as an open hearted man will alw.ays do iu 1
such a cafe with refpeft and gratitude.â 1
(Page 25 of the letter.) t
T hough the year is not exprefled when '
Tom Paine was liberated, it wa-6 in 1794,
as will appear by Mr. Monroe's letters, da' '
te<J Ift Nov. 1794 and '3'h J anu ary, 1795 1
(page 100.) As then he rtfided more than t
a year and a half from the 4th November t
1 794 house of the American minis- a
ter, he was certainly there in FebruaVy and t
September 1795, and most probably in JJu t
,|y 1796 when the last letter was wriuen.â t
The firft mentioned of tjiefe letters, it it a
true, when it was shewn to Mr. Monroe was
deiircd to be recalled, which was for that n
time accordingly done, but was afterwards it
sent in 1796. More than 15 months after F
the date of this letter, Tom Paine was per- ei
mitted to live with the American miuider as V
one of his family upon terms of familiar le
friendfllip, instead of which treatment he k
ought to have been instantly shewn the tloor lei
and forbid his house. In it he reproached at
the Prefidei.t for not interposing Jiis e'xerti- o]
to obtain his liberation from the impri- cc
"inmettt infiided by the ruling p .w'er of d,
France, which lie attributed wholly to his er
kfire to keep him at a diftahce from the U- or

l"l fence of a man who might disApprove of the
r } .administration, and who had credit enough

ihe gainst the proclaraation. of neutrality and
ind cenfurcd the conduct of Mr. Jay in his ne
jch gociation and lome other stepÂ» of the Exe
cutive-
,Â» . The letter of thi 20th September 1795,
les, ' s con cise, impudent, insolent, infamous.
ar - In this he demanded copies of whatever the
ri - President had written refpe&inj him, either
Oes in hi 3 public or private letters, and conclu
ded in the following wMr3Â»i, " v lcujght not

11 up the American government, either of these
ro _ 1 will involve you in reproach you will not

the j that Tom Paine when he wrote this letter
the ' had resided almost a year under the roof of
o' 8 " the American minister, was then resident
"' ls under the fame roof, ?nd for many months
afterwards continued to rt-fide there.
j n . The last letter of Tom Paine to President
the Wafhingtoii is dated 30th July 1796, when
â m, mod probably he was ttill enjoying the
ain friendly hofpiulity of the American m.iujf
e^ n ter. it coufiits of, jipwards df fifty pages
Cl , s ! and comprehends ihg tvyo former which are
, s ! made parts of it t hqee letters were
â¢da - | to the Editor bf;f%4jwora, the libel
een printer against the late President and his
Wid.| ntcaiures, aij4 tjÂ»e friend of the American
lr, d : tninifter, in order that they rpight be pub
afy j lifhed. Some eÂ»traÂ£ts may be seen in the
| Aurora I believe, and the whole in a pam
,cr. phlet which was printed by bim in the fall
ap. of J796, when the minds of our citizens
md were drawn to the choiceÂ»oÂ£ a fucceflbr to
,n ; the President of the United States who had
the previously publiftied his determination to re
' 0 tit;e. It is well known to every body that
orf in the contest at the late eleÂ£iion for Prefi
the dent, the real political question to be deci
ded ded was whether the Wafhingtonian system
ed, of administration (hould bÂ® continued or
uÂ»- not, which system was too independent to
'"<j be pleasing to France. The French Re
nce f lc was intent on raising to the helm Mr.
~ly Jefferfon, who was deemed by it, and as
U- appears since from Jiis reputed letter to Maz
m- zei wasjuftlydeemed,hoftile to that political j
or system, if not to the comftitution itfelf of
tal " the United States. The following is an
extract from this almost iocredible but ever !
memorable letter to Majizei. Â«Â«, Our politi- |
, ns cal Situation is prodigiouily changed since I
jre you fcft us. Instead of that noble love of
;ifr-. liberty ftvLt&ot republican government, which
a- carried us triumphantly thro' the dangers
I,d of the war, an anglo-monarchico-arjftocra
â¢~ tic party,has arisen.. Their avowed obje&ii to
to on us substance, as they, hkveal
on ready given us the form of the.British gov
:nt ernment,&c.'' The only important change
in- of government to whiph the writer alluded,
e : was from the old confederation to theprefent
conjiitution, which is like (as he fays) to the
British government, and is not republican.
Of course he cannot be expected to love or
x _ revere it, but to hate it, if this is his real
ti- opinion of our constitution.
This letter also adds, " it is fofHcient that
we guard ourselves and that we break the
j | 1 lilliputian ties by which they have bound us
a ll in the firft (lumbers which succeeded our la- j
lc _ boiirs." What does this mean ? What are
as the Lilliputian ties which the author means, j
id As I conceive, the ties of the conftitntion, !
â¢'d and none else can be understood. Moreo- j
ver, the letter fays, " we have against us |
; ' the Execativepower, the judiciary power, aIL
the officers of government, and all who are j
seeking offices, all timid men. Need it be
alked who is or can. be jneant ;by the Exe
ne_ cutive power, but the President of the U
th nited States. In (hort.whatjdoes this fen
;n tence mean but that the wjiole adminiftrati
g. on, the President, tjye judges and all the o
ae ther officers are opposed to republican gov- 1
_ ernment and attached to njouarchy and are 1
ry ready to destroy the liberties of America. 1
ft Lastly, the writer obferyes, "it fuffices that 1
1, we arrest tfce progress of that system of in- 1
le gratitude arid injustice towards France fro.m i
1D which they would alienate lis, to bring ug 1
e- under Bntilh influence, &c." I (half not i
,f permit rhyfelf to comment on these passages 1
Â». of the letter to Mazzei. But Ido not now 1
bcfitate to 'fay that 1 believe, and that it is <
a generally believed, that this letter was writ- f
p. ten by Mr. Jefitrfpn. If genuine, it sure- <
ii -ly proves that the expeaations of France c
_ were well founded. For a Jong time before 1
the elefticn all Frenchmen, all American de- t
n mocrats, and all malcontents had fixed cn li
him to succeed to the Presidential autho- c
rity and had made this the grand obje<S of h
> their political pursuits. From localaixlo- v
n ther considerations, many of our good ci- o
r tizens were disposed to favor his eleftioÃ
- also, at that time believing him more at- 0
1 tached to the constitution and less opposed
- to the Wafhingtonian ajdininiftration, than
- tl\ey are now from iaformation
1 authorized to believe. ' ' S
9 To promote the ele&i'on of this gentle. R
t | man, all means were, it is belfeved called
s into aftiou, which were in the pgwer of the
r French republic. From this cause proceed
â¢ ed the letter of Tom Paine to President e,
1 Wa(hingtbn, to which I have referred, a m
â¢ letter that is become very notorious, and is ic
known by the appellation of the infamous ! jj'
letter of Tom Paine: It made its appearance : fj,
at a time when it might impress the public .ai
opinion ngainft man who wished for a th
contirfoande of the system on which Prefi
deflt Walhington had admjniltered the gov- m
ernment. Soon after this, other publicati
on 3 of the lame tendency were niadt; nor was pj
t
â¢Â«..i? â¢ â¢ f
re* say tune thought so suitable for Mr. Adct
he to publish the angry mam'fefto of the French
gh republic, as when, in the ftatc of Pennfyl
<i, vania the people were about to give tiicir
a- votes for WeiSors of the Prefideutof the U
tÂ«d nited States. It was on the votes of this
estate, which, from tfir operation of the law
e- were almost certain of bei.ig all on the fame
fide, that the ele&ion was supposed to de
5, pend. That the manifesto had a sensible ef
is. feft on fotxe of the inhabitants of our city
ae of the focicty of friends, is not to be doubt
er ed.
Â» :
J " In this letter I'om Paine declares him
felf '' opposed to almost the whole of his
(Wafhington's) adminiftration,and ptomifes
tn prove it to have- been iificient.ifnot pcrfi* j
, U dious, as well as unjult in refpeclto Fiance." ;
This is what Mr. Monroe in his book does
j in substance undertake to prqve : This too
is the opinion w.hieh is contained in the let
ter to Mazzei; and this is the charge that
e the French republic, by her functionaries
0 has often repeated. That the people (hould
believe that this charge is well founded, and
t j v that their confidepce and affeftion were
misplaced in their former President, is dee-
hied an important preliminary, to the fuc-.
cess of their plan of bringing about 3, change
a( j in the present administration, and perhaps
in the constitution. Some of the writers
avow this fentiinent in terms, and
t Tom Paine declares his wiflt to change the
l is constitution in some inftauces which are
mentioned in the letter.
Nt Upon the political topieks whieh are em
rn braced in Tom Paine's letter, it must be ob-
He served that his opinions are cenfonant with
if- those of Mr. Monroe on the fame fubje&s as
ss they arcexprelfed in his letter and narrative,
re The similarity of"ideas, aiid in a few inftan
re ces of expressions, is f> striking that the
â ]- reader woirtd naturally believe that the two
is authors held a free communion of ienti- N
Jn ments with each other, while they lived uti
b- der the fame roof. As it would be tedious
xe to make quotations to prove this, I ftiall
n- rely on the candor of those who (hall read
ill both, for the accuracy of the remaik i nor
is shall I quote from the letter the many op
:o probrious and slanderous expressions which
id ruii throughout it, and which call forth the
e- indignation of every honest man in every
at quarter of the world : But as I have ad
fi. verted to the patronage afforded by Mr.
i- Monroe, in his own house, to Tom Paine,
m for the space of more than eighteen months,
)r while he was there writing insolent letters
;o to President Walhington, to be commum
:â¢ cated through the medium of Bache's Au
r. rota, designed to injure the reputation of
u the President, to promote the views of the
5 . French republic in regard to his successor ;
al ; to strengthen the French faftion among us,
>f i (hake the confidence of the people in 'all
in those who approve and supported theWa(h
---:r ingtonfyftesi.fromaconvidtionthat it was the
i. ( wisest and best for the common happiness, -I
e ! must not, cannot forbear to present to-public
if confiderbtioÃ the last paragraph of that most
h infamous letter, from this (ample well, may
rg be imagined the reft. It is as follows,"thiÂ»
a- is the ground upon which Ametipa now
;o stands. All her rights of commerce and
]. navigation have to commence anew, and that
j. with the. loss of charafter to begin with. If
p e there 13 sense of shame enough left in the
1, heart to call a blu(h into the cheek, the
Waftiiugton administration must be afliamed
le to appearâand as to you, Sir, treacherous
j. in private friendfhi'p (for so you have been to
r lne , and that, in the day of danger) and a
d hypocrite in public life, the world will be puz
zled to decide whether yon are an apostate
or an impostor; whether you have abandon
e ed good principles, or whether you ever had
s any }" Who would have thought it peffible
. J that the author of this paragraph was the
e companion of the American minister in his
I, ; own house at Paris? It has been proved, and
, : who can deny it after reading the proofs?
- 1 In addition to the instances of mifconduft
s | in his ministry which have been ipe'cifie<2& in
I, aggravation oft.hera,Mr. Monroe while A
e j merican minister is proved to have been the
e patron of Tom Paine the libel writer, and
. the confidential friend of Bache the libel
. printer, against the President and his ad- j
. ministration.
From the single motive of doing good,
- I have submitted. my view of our late mi
â¢ nifter's conduft, arifiug principally from the
s doepments which he has publilhed. Oug't
. the patron of Tom Paint, ought the friend
t ps Bache, ought the man who had coinmitt
- ed the afts of mifcondud to which I have
1 adverted, ougbt the man who pofleffed
the confidence of the opposition party
r in this Country and of the French Ru
-3 lers which he endeavoured to acquire by his
r subserviency, ought the man wlio paid more
; deference to the judgment of the French 1
â  fa&ion which probably coincided with his 1
own, than to the opinions and sentiments 1
orf your President. Ought such a man to
: have been continued as minister of the Uni- \
ted States to the FrenÂ« h republic ? Ought ,
his associates in politics any longer to be
countenanced. Ought they not all be a- t
bandoned as insidious enemies to the public !
weal, to the union, felicity and independence \
of these United States.
