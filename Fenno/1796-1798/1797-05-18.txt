The inferiptiont of citizent on the register
of eieftions are more numerous than at any
former period of the revolution, and the elec
tions promise to be condudted without tu
nnvlt or cabal. The (hock which has been
given to the public credit of England, will
contribute efTcntially to the consolidation of
the power of the French government, and to
the prevention of any clandiftine efforts at
this ciitical moment to i nard the march of
the conftitutien. [A'. T. Alinerva.]
Our cflrrefpondent obfervtt, and not, per
haps unjustlyâThat since the Prefident't
Proclamation convening both houses of CÂ»n
grefs, cor.jefturehas been endeavouring to
fix upon the measures to be adopted in our
present embarrÂ»ffed fitualion of affairs. One
opinion is, that an Embargo will but
a (lep so fatal to the country interest, would
not meet with general approbation, nor
would it, if long continued, be favorable to
the Treafuryâlf it be temporary, or made
to last one, two, or three months enl\, it
could not produce *ety feriou3 evils to those
on whom it would be meant to operate, but
the efleits would-be pretty sensibly felt by
us. Yet, unltfs an embargo take place, and
while thcreexillsa possibility that veflels may
go and return fafe from the Weft Indies,
many will rifle (hipments, and of courfc
hazard their credit, and with it the intsrefls
of those they arc connected with. One con
sequence must be, that cauntry produce
would fall to nearly the old prices, and enable
people to livefomething cheaper than at pres
ent ; but then Weft India produdtions would
rife out of all ptoportion to the fail of ours.
On the whole, an embarga seems to be as
little to be wished as the capturing of our
reflelsâboth are pfegnant with evilsâTo
avoid both seems however, impracticable.
What then is to be done ? Some fay, dif- s
patch a special envoy to France, as we did to
Great-Britainâbut he must be of principles
congenial to those of the Direftory, or he
will experience the fate of general Phckney.
If we fend Mr. Jefferfon or Mr. Madison, or
any othej, whose politics are of the fame
.cast, we may perhaps get a treaty, but it
will be little better than a declaration of war.
fiance, elated by her fuce.efles, will not listen
to any terms (horl of an abfnlute renuncia
tion of our treaty with England. ]f the
ambassador makes fueh a treaty, we fltould
certainly refuf* ratifying it, and then war en
fuetmoft inevitably. There is no alternative.
In the mean time, while the envoy is gone,
vigorous preparations for defence ftiould be
(joing forward, and our readiness to repel in
sult, be co extensive with the disposition, on
the part of others, to give it. After the
patience with which depredations on our
property has been borne, and after evincing
a strong desire to maintain peace at the ex
pense of almost unbounded facrifices, the
FtopLE, by whom are meant to be understood
REAL AMERICANS, would cordially
unite in a very sincere abhorrence of their
unrighteous oppressors, and those who ad
vocate themâAgainst the former they would
aft with the energy of union if haltihty be
c:me necefTaryâThe latter would probably
be compelled to seek an asylum in their
vorite country, or undergo the treatment ex
peri.nced by the enemies of American inde
pendence at the beginning of our revolution
âThis wonld be perfeflly reasonable ; for
no man who is a friend to the enemies of his
country, and an open enemy to that country,
Ihoold, in timet of trouble, when their un
derhand contrivances may be detrimental, be
permitted to live there. [JV. T. D. A.~\

Petition for the dismissal of the present
Minijlry.
Guildhall, London, March 24.
ADDRESS AND PETITION.
Yesterday being appointed for the hold
ing of a Common Hall of the Livery of
the city of London, the Guildhall about
twelve o'clock was crowded with the Li
verymen, in the place allotted, and all
the galleries round that end where the Lot
tery is drawn, were filled with ladies and
gentlemen
At one o'clock the Lord Mayor, Alder
men, and other City Officers took their
places, and it was impossible not to observe
with what ardour and acclamation Alder
men Combe, Skinfter, Newman, and some
othert were received, when they bowed in
passing the Livery, while marks of insult
ing disapprobation were shown to others.
The Court being opened with the usual
formalities, the Lord Mayor opened the
proceedings by faying, that in consequence
of a requiiition made by a competent num
ber of Liverymen, he had convened"them
to take into consideration a motion to be
made, " That an humble Address awd Pe
" tition be presented to his Majesty upon
" the present Â»larming state of public as
" fairs, and praying him to diftnifs his
" present Ministers from his Councils for
" ever, as the firft step towards obtaining
" a speedy, honourable, and permanent
" Peace." This fubjeÂ£t, his Lordship said,
he would leave to their decision, without
making any observation whatever.
Mr. Waddington then came forward.
He was delegated, he said, to present to
them that day, a motion of the utmost im
portance to themselves and to their coun
try. A system hatl for a longtime part been
pursued, of erefting a barrier between the
crown and the people, but he trusted that
the time was now arrived when the ave
nues of the. throne would once more be
opened, never more to be closed. There
was once a time when Eriglllhmen knew
how to claim their just, hereditary, and in
defealible rights, and knowing how to
claim, they knew also how to aflert them.
But unhappily of late, measures had too
fuccefsfully been taken to (hut the mouths
of the people, and in proportion as their
voice vaa ftifled, were their grievances
encreafed. They had seen, from time to
time, all their liberties abridged, their
public meetings prohibited, and even an
attempt made to defeat theunqueftionable
right of the Liverymen of London to as
semble in. Common-Hall that day. The
period was at length arrived, when their
misery or happiness depended on them
selves. He would forbear at present to
dwell on the dreadful calamities which the
Minilters of the crown had brought upon
their country. If he were difpol'ed to do
so, they were far too numerous for recapi
tulation ; and it was not now his purpose
to reproach the frailties of human nature.
The Livery of the City of London would
not this day cry out for punilhment, tho'
they must claim redress:âThey fought not
" indemnity for the past," but " security
for the future."
It was, however, impossible for them to
(hut their eyes against the inipoveri(hed,
graded and miserable condition to which
the nation was reduced. They must fee
the horrors of a deftruftive war, devour
ing up their resourcesâthe nation depopu
lated, bankrupt, and yet these very Mini
lters, who brought this mighty nun upon
them, (till retain their places, and pursue
the fame course of measures. They could
not forget the conduft of these Ministers
in the memorable 27th of February, and
observing all these things they must imitate
the spirit and vigour of their ancestors.The
only remedy for these complicated evils,
was peace; but peace, while the present
administration continued, was not to be
expected. Feeling then the present, and
dreading the final misfortunes that threat
ened them in the climaxot'thefe measures,
he (made no doubt of their unanimously
concurring in the motion lie was about te
propose.
He then moved the Address and Petition
to his Majesty, as already stated, and was
seconded by a Liveryman, whose name we
do not know.
On the (how of hands, it appeared to
be carried unanimously; but on a more
fcrutinous examination it was found that
there were five or fix hands held up against
it.
The Lord Mayor then declared that the
question was carried in the affirmative.
Mr. Waddington aga'm catne forth with
a Petition to his Majelty, which he said, he
(liould propose without any comment; for
comments could only oblcure that which
needed no elucidation. He then proposed
the Petition to his Mafelly, couched in ve
ry (Irong language, expressing that they
approached the Throne in deepest affliction,
and after enumerating all the effects that
flowed from the miscarriages of the pre
sent war, and after ascribing them all to
the tnifcondutt of his Majelly's Ministers,
humbly solicits him as the only means of
procuring a peace, so much wished and
wanted by the nation, to difmtfs from his
Councils forever his Miuilters and secret
advisers.
Mr. Alderman Skinner seconded this mo
tion in a very temperate and fenliblefpeech.
He confidcred the happiness of them to de
pend in a great ineafure on the adoption of
the Petition now presented to them. He
had been for upwards of thirty years a Li
veryman of that city, and never did he
know any question agitated, that approach
ed in importance the subject that was now
before them. They saw the ruifl that was
brought upon the country, a ruin so nearly,
complete, that it was difficult to think
how that completion could be averted.
The most likely means of avertiugit would
obviouflybe a peace, but the atlminiftr*-
tion of the country was wholly devoted to
.the continuance of the war. J/e had re- '
volved this subjeCt very i'oridufly in his
mind, and he would tell them what was
the result of his deliberationsâHe was
sure that they would never think of ascrib
ing to him any other motives but those of
the public welfare, with which was con
nected intimately, that of thi Corporation
to which lie had the honour to belong. In
the whole of his public conduct they could
perceive nothing which had any other ob
jcCt than the difeharge of his duty, and the
forwarding of their interelts. That was
his highelt honour,, his greaftft gratifica
tion, â  and the only reward that he ever
did cr ever would accept.
To conlider the llate of national affairs,
to which he before aimed, it would be ne
cefi'ary to contrail the circuiiiftances of the
country, as they flood at the commencement
of the war in 1795, with its present situa
tion. In the year 1792, the debl-of the na
tion amounted to about two hundred and
twenty mil lions, the interest for Which was
about nine millions three hundred thousand
pounds, or there-about. The annual ex
penditure was about sixteen millions, its
income as much, and we were going on ve
ry well. Since the present war the debt of
the country had increased one hundred and
feventy-five millions, and upwards; and
the whole of it at present was four hundred
millions, the interest upon which was it
millions and upwards. Our annual expen
diture was twenty millions, to defray which
we had about sixteen millions of income.â
Taking the cafe of the country then as
men would that of an individual, how was
it possible, withoul bankruptcy, that things
could be made to go on ? But, unfortunate
ly, a national bankruptcy had already taken
place, and bad as our situation was at pre
sent, what were our prospeCts for the fu
ture ? Of the loan of la.it year v three mil
lions remained yet unpaid, asd, of course,
itill to be provided for. The Minister had
just concluded another loan of twelve mil
lions, and Ihould the war continue, mult
before Michaelmas raise forty millions
more. This was a serious and alarming
confederation. In 1792, the Consols were
at 90 or 91; at the present moment they
were at jo and under all these accumulated
difadvsntajes of bankruptcy, decay of trade
depression of credit, &c. &c. how thecoun
try was to be retrieved, was aconfideration
which could scarcely be looked at without
the utmost dismay.
He congratulated the company on the al
mofl perfect uftaniinity which they display
ed on the motion firft proposed to them;
and this led him to fay a little on the nun
t;er in which the decilions of Common-Halls
had frequently been treated. He had heard
it often aliened, that the sense of the Com
mon- Hall did not convey the sense of the
Livery of London. This he undertook
positively to deny. He was then addrefling
upwards three t/nufand gentlemen, who ap
proved the measures propol'ed to them With
almofl perfett unanimity. The Livery of
London consisted of from eight or nine thou
sand persons who had beep summoned, and
called upon by public avertifement to attend
this meeting. When three thousand of
this number appeared, with only a very few j
individuals to oppose them, he maintained
that their fejntiments > thus publicly given,
were those df that Livery of London ; be
cause, if there was any considerable num- :
ber of a ditFerent opinion, the Hall, the re
gular place for giving their decision, was j
open-to receive them. But it wasalledged
that a ballot in the refpsCti've Wards had
generally contradicted the opinions expres
sed in the meeting of the Common Hall.
How were these ballots conducted ? Under
the inspection of persons in authority from j
the Treasury, the Ctiftoms, the Bank, the
India Houfeâln fine, under such controul,
that the Liverymen, without ruin to them
selves, were not at liberty to vote in favour
of their real sentiments. Upon those
grounds he was warranted to maintain,
that the Common-Hall alone pronounced
the real sense of the Liverymen of London.
Before he fat down, there was one subjeCt
more, which, though not connected with
the present one, he would nevertheless in
cidentally mentionâThis was the plan now
nowgoingforwardsfor building Wet Docks
at Wapping. The success of such a mea
sure would irretrievably ruin some thou
sands of the families of worthy citizens.
He spared ho paiirs or endeavours to oppose
it, and any of them who should call upon
him at any time, should find him a fleady
afliflant, ready to devote his time and his
labourâevery exertion within his means
to defeat the scheme of the merchants.
This speech was received with the loudefl
applause.
Mr. Alderman Newnham fpokc In so low a
tone of voice, that we could colled but very
little of a speech which he read from a Iheet
of paper. He said, however, that he had
been one of that Livery about 50 years, and
always observed that progressively, from
time to time, one or othsr of our privileges
had been occasionally frittered away. But the
strides made towards dtfporifm in the last
few years exceeded all that had been in tho
many preeeeding ones ; -and it was only by
some vigorous exertions, to which the busi
ness of the present day might be a prelode,
that the liberties of the people could be re
llored, and the country preserved from de-
ItruCtion. He enumerated, under five dif
ferent heads, the progrelfive invasions made
by Government on the rights and intereftsof
the subjeCt, and concluded by recommend
ing the adoption of the present motion.
The opinions of the worthy Alderman
corresponding with those of the meeting,
and his venerable age produced a refpeCtful
silence in the Hall during his Speech, which
was fcarcdy audible.
Thequeltion was then put, and carried,
with the fame acclimation as the former one.
Mr. Waddington moved, That the Lord
Mayor, Aldermen, Sheiiffs, and City mem
bers be rcquefted to present this Petition to
his Majelty on the throne.
Mr. Hanfon,faid, as the City of London
had of late so little access orintercourfe with
the Throne, he was happy in the opportu
nity of seconding the present motionâwhich
was carried as before.
Mr. Taddy moved, that it be signed by
the Town Clerk ; which being seconded, was
also carried in the fame manner.
Mr. Hanfon, after some farcaflical remarks
on the conduit of those who endeavoured to
prevent the present meeting, and palling an
eulogium on those whose honorable perse
verance produced it, moved the thanks of
the Hell to the forty-three independeat Li
verymen, who have so honorable defended
the rights and privileges of the City of Lon
dwn, which vvafi fecorided and cjtuea as the
formei.
Mr. Har.fon next said, that he had another
motion to propose, which he doubted not
they would cheartully assent to. It could
not so soon have escaped their remembrance,
that for the advantages which might relult
from their prefeut meeting, they were ii
debted to the conllitutional conduit of the
Common Council, who refilled every allure
ment and every influence ihat could be used,
in order to secure them in their undoubted
privileges. They had lately been aflembled
for a purpose of a molt extraordinary nature.
When petfons met for objeCts of advantage
to their country, they might propeily be
called a Council ; but when they aflembled
for purposes averse to their liberties and in*
terefts, they might with equal propriety be
denominated a Cabal. In this fort of def
ciiption, the gentlemen alluded to, refufed
to be included, and he therefore moved the
thanks of the meeting to the Common Coun
cil of the City of London, for declining to
give Â«ny opinion on the propriety or expe
diency of calling a Commou Hall.
Mr. Wm. Smith, M. P. molt cordially se
conded the motion of thanks to a set of gen
tlemen, through whose means he had an op
portunity of addrefling them ; for if he had
been precluded from addrefling them then
as a Liveryman, as-he law now Hood, he
should not have in his power of addrefling
them, or any other meeting, so numerously
attended, at all. The conduit of the Com
mon Council on that ocÂ«afion was tlrongly
contralied with that of their worthy chief
magillrate (for whatever he might think of
this strange proceeding, he must call him
worthy while fitting in that chair.) Speak
ing, however, as a citizen of London, he
could not forbear to fay that the conduit of
the Lord Mayor, in endeavoring to (hield his
refufal to aflemble a common hall, under the
fan&ion of an opinion of the court of com
mon council, did meet, and should ever meet
with his highelt disapprobation. He had
known his lordlhip for many years, and must
do him the juitice to fay, that as a private
gentleman hi* life was iireproachable ; and
as a merchant he had always displayed the
diligence, punctuality, and integrity which
beeame that character. Some-time after
wards he went into another cotirfe of life,
and became a servant of the executive gov
ernment. In tnat capacity also he conduct
ed himfelf very meiitorioufly ; and by his
ceconomy and honesty saved several thoufaad
pounds to the public purse, which, it was
well known, had been plundered by his pre
decefiors.. But, unfortunately, it seemed
that, in his present situation, he aould not
entirely divest himfelf of the other chara&er
of a servant of the executive government.
The voice, however, of the common coun
cil recalled him to a better recollection.
He congratulated the meeting on the una
nimity which, with the exception of five or
fix gentlemen, sow prevailed amongst them.
He honoured those few gentlemen, for the
firmnefs they displayed in support of their
opinions, though in truth he mult fay there
was nothing besides their firmnefs, for which
be could honor them. When only so few
persons amongst 9000 of the Liverymen of
London could be prevailed upon by any in.
fluence to come forward in the face of their
fellow citizens, and oppose the business of the
day, it was fair to infer, that amoogft the
whole 9000, there were no naore than those
five or fix individuals, who sincerely entertain
ed sentiments averse to the present proposi
tions. Whatever may afterwards be effected
by influence, compulsion, or corruption, more
powerful than the other two, it could never
be supposed to express the sense of the Liv
erymenof London.
He expeited the happielt effeCts to flow
from the refolutioni of this day, which would
evince to the whole kingdom that the metro
polis was sincere and ardeut.in its wishes for
peace, and would not cntruft the conclusion
of it with a set of men who had conducted
the war with as much inconfideration and
folly as they had originally engaged it. It
was well known that there generally prevail
ed through allthe nation, a desire for peace;
but this was the firft time that it had been
publicly and explicitly avowed by any great
public body, and he hoped that the example
oÂ»se given would fpeediiy be followed by all
the great towns in the kiggdom.
The lord mayor next presented himfelf,
but was, at firft, exceedingly ill received.
He did not mean, he said, that day to have
troubled them with any iddrefs, but he ho
ped his fellow-citizens would refleCt, that if
their firlt magillrate would not attempt to
defend himfelf when attacked, he was un
worthy the situation to which they had cleCtcd
him. He thanked not the honorable gentle
men for the compliments he paid himâthe
honor and integrity of his character needed
no tellimony from him. He had been forty
years a member for the city of London ; and
the propriety of his conduit in that capacity,
as well as in private life, he believed, no man
would gainsay, for no man did he ever do an
injury. What opinion his fellow-citizens en
tertained of him, was proved by their eleCting
him into three fucccflive Parliaments; and
their sense of the manner in which he dif
chrfrged his duty as their representative, was
(hewn by the thanks which he had the honor
to receive from them. He had been employ
ed in the service of the executive government,
and was entrufled with an important part of
the public purse. Did he difeharge that trull
honettly ? Witness, after the length of his
important employments, the feantinefs of his
fortuneâand what temptation for mal-ad
miniftration was there in a man, who covet
ed neither honors nor emoluments.
How dared the honorable gentleman to
then aflert, that he was a man incapable of
diftinguilhing between his gratitude to the
executive government, and his duty as chief
magillrate of the city of Louden ? He was
no longer a servant of the executive govern
ment, and he would not fay at the fame time
that he was unthankful for the confidence
they reposed in him. But his fortune was
not mended by that confidenceâhe owed
every thing to hi* fellow*citizens, and his
liljjtieft ambition was to difcTiarge the c'Â»ti<rÂ»
of hi 9 high offiue with justice, with liboality,
and with honor. As to the immediate fub
jcft of the charge raade agaiofl him, he would
lay thÂ»t when the requisition was made to
him to call a common hail, "ha thought it
proper to take Come time to consider of it.
'Ha afterwards conftilted the cotltt of com
mon council merely as frienas, whose advice
might be of fctvice to liitn ; but determined
that ultimately his <\wn judgment should go
vern his decision. It (bould also be cunfider
ed that in consulting the court of common
council, he was by no means singular, as his
predeceflors had done the fame on hmilaroc
cafions. His lordlhip concluded with pro
feflions of attachment to his countiy and to
the livery of London.
The quefiion was then cut, and carried in
the affirmative.
Mr. Hanfon reminded them of the refolu
tien of the last hall, and its reprobation of
money being sent out of theeountry without
the confert or knowledge of Parliament, at a
time when it was fitting. They inftrufted
their representatives upon that occafien ; but
some gentlemen in that lituation represented
their constituents, some represented the tpi
niftry, and others represented themselves.
Mr. Aldeiman Combe, on that occasion, re
prefeHted his constituents, and had his col
leagues done the fame, we might not now have
been reduced to a national bankruptcy. He
then proposed the thanks of the meeting to
Mr. Alderman Combe, their worthy rcpre
fentative, & .was fcconded by Mr. Waithman,
which was carried in the fame manner as the
other propofllions.
Mr. Waithman moved, That the resoluti
ons be printed in all the morning and evening
papers, which was seconded by Mr. Cjx,
and agreed to.
The Court then adjourned.

" Our attention, for some days pad, has ft,
been taken up by a publication from the es
Bank, fignifying it was ihc order of govern
ment that they (hould decline the payment of
specie, to which effeft an order of council
was issued. The avowet>-(and I believe ge T
uoine) reason isâThat country people aud be
others equally pusillanimous have become ap- mi
preherfive of danger by an invasion, and have th
in consequence been converting all their pre- an
perty, as far as in their power, into hard-ca(h. ba
This, of course, has produced a great tun for pa
money on the provincial banking establish- hi
mÂ«nts ; and many of them, on this account, a i
have been under the oeceffity of (lopping li(
payment, tho' possessing fufficient funds to fei
discharge more than treble the amount of ril
their out-standing paper. To prevent there- (h
fore the extension of this e+il, which would
have drained the nation of its circnlating me- I
diurri, to the gieat embarraflment of all an
pecuniary tranfaflions, is the reason of this
bold and strenuous measure. It has met the
approbation and promised support of the B
greater part of our peers and firft rate com- D
moners, as well as a great majority of bank- f' l
ers, merchants, traders, &c. Bat although
its neceflity i 6 undoubted, still from the great
delicacy which attaches ta the credit of the
Bank of England (which however has given w
the most undoubted proof of its abundant sol- w
vency) I sincerely hope the reftriÂ£lioii will P 1
be but of Stort continuance." al

COMMUNICATION. .
It is reeoramended to every person who wi(h- a
es to obtain correct notions of the intentions,
views, and relative strength and weakness of the v
European nations, to read " The Politics of the F
Cabinets of Europe, during the reigns of Louis )
XV. aid XVI" Count de Broglio, in a paper s
in that work, mentioning Holland, observes, r
" that it fears every thing, complains of every t
thingt and defends nothing." Such appears to
be the line of eonduil which our Gallo-Ameri
can democrats recommend to the United States :
â viz. "to fear France, to fuffer every thing from l
France, to complain of every thing, and to 1
defend nothing." This is certainly a poli- j
cy which would be very gratifying to France, ,
but it is one which must soon reduce-us to A ,
COMPLETE DEPENDANCE ON FRANCE.

The House then resolved itfelf into a com

by the Clerk,
' Mr. Craik said he had prepared a resolu
tion, the fame in substance as it had been
â usual to pass on forme;' similar
Vhich he should fubfoit to the consideration
of the House. It was in these words:
â¢' Resolved, that it is the opinion of this
committee, that a refpe&ful address ought to
be presented by the House of Representatives
to the President of the United States,
fwer to his fpeeeh ta both Houses of Con
rreft, at the commencement of this session,
containing assurances that this House will
take into consideration the various and im

The resolution was carried unanimously,

WHAT would you give to destroy the
whole race of the Caterpillar !âGive Iâl ~
would give more than I'll fayâbut it :s im
possible. I have tried experiments, until 1
am tired. Yes, you have tried flaming tow
and lamp oil ; you have shot their nelts to 1
pieces, tvith yourmufket, and pulled them
down with your long forked pole ; and all
this you have done, on rainy days, when
the caterpillars weremoftly within their nests
âand you have found, to your mortification,
that thev would often repair their nests the
next day, or if you decreased the number far
the present season, they were, alter all your
pains, as numerous the next.
NO IV MIND ME.
You have often observed that, at a cer- Â£
tain time in the summer, the caterpillars ap.
pear to quit their nests entirely, and even the
trees, and wander over the fields and on the t
fences. This generally happens, the latter f
end of June, or the beginning of July. Be
that as it may, when ever this happens, do
you take the old dried nest, 6reak it open,
an<2 within it you will find a little pod, fame- f
what like the silk worm's cone ; destroy that 1
pod, for it contains the parent of the next t
year's race'of caterpillais; which like the
queen bee, produce, the whole f.mily. This ,
must be done, soon after the caterpillar quits j
the nest for out of this pod comes a miliar <
fly, who foims round and upon the finall 1
blanches of the appW, or wild cherry tree, <
the latter (he seems to prefer, a number of |
little calls, in which (he deposits her eggs, ]
and then covers them with a gluey substance, ;
which effeftually preserves them, until the
next fpringâhinc illius ortus. Hence springs j
the caterpillar family. _ (
Now let the farmers, in a town, or vicini
ty, agree to search for the proper time, and i
effeftually to destroy these pods, and my
word for it, their ncighbouihood (hall be a
land of Gofhen the next year.

above equalization is upon decimal princi

8 BY the favor of Divine Providence the interna!
* affairs of the state continue prosperous and happy,
t The unprovoked aggressions, made under the au
n thority of the French nation, on our external com
merce, by which we are affe&ed in common with
the other of the United States, have occasioned
such an extensive deftruÂ«flion of property, and di
l' minution of the national revenme, that ithc lofies
e rtfulting therefrom will admit Â©t no easy talcula
a culation. Should these depredations continue, the
( ] redu<stion of eur experts, and (of the pdces Â©four
productions, and the check which will-Â£ given to
r " cnterprize and industry, will be injuries which will
" be very sensibly felt. There are, however, evils
>f of still greater magnitude which this conduit is
probably intended to produce ; but which it will
be more in the power Â©four country tÂ© prevent.
I We may trust that no facrifices will bethought
J too dear to be made, rather than resign our iia
tional charaJler, and our absolute independence.
As the obtaining of rcdrefs for national injuries,
ig and providing for our general security, are fub
je<sU which fall under the cognizance of our na
tional government, no other duties are therefore
incumbent on us relative thereto, but, as members
of the union, to carry into effect such measures as
the national administration shall prescribe. It may
however, be expedient to attend to such equip
n ments of the military force of the state as may
place it in a condition to aÂ£t most extensively
when legally required ; and to provide such necef-
H > fary means for Â©ur local defence as the national
to government may not probably afford.
By the last returns of the militia of the state,
m there can be no dovbt but there are many valuable
1 arms in their hands,thcugh not an adequate lupply
of lWh as may be depended upon fervice
There appeared to be a very considerable defici |
72 ency of cartridges; owing, it is said, to the great
78 scarcity and dearnefs ol powder. The other
equipments are very considerable, but not com-
CO Plcte
' It appears that some of the Matrofs Companies
are provided with brass field pieces ; but that
otheriare but partially supplied. None probably
with powder and ball fvfficicut for actual service.

Juflice requires mc to wHferve thitt great nrili ary to h
ambition, mad regard to subordination appear in the Â£
militia, and that no dou;>t exists of their prompti- f rQU
tude to defend, when required, thofc rights which
they were conftitnted to preserve-
It is further proper for me to notice, that there con
are no military magazines cftabliftied in the state ; eng
and, although the general government has offered b U Â£
some to the important port of New-
London, yet, that we have a numSer of other
ports in the state of confideraSleconfequence, which ' lB /
are not furnifked with such heavy and efficient ar- P r,v
tiilery as are necefTary for their effectual defence. tain
In this view of our military arrangements and W J,|
equipments, and the general afpeA of our national
affair >, I fubmi't to the wisdom of the legifl-'ture ,
the expediency of appropriating such part of our 1
rcfourcesas may be necessary to place the state iti l,on
a more adequate condition of defenee. C
We fhail be happy if there be ground to believe
that better reflections will restrain the pursuits ct mof
the nation by whose condu& we more efpeci&lly ,
fuffer. But, when a nation shall alfume ths power t
to limit and dire& the commerce of every neutral lor
natien on which they can make an imprefiion,and wer
manifeft their firfl hostile dt by ads of gene- an< j
ral plunder, not only in violation of the laws Â®i w
nature and nations, but of treaties and a profefleJ
friendfhip, it will be difficult to afcertaiu any â¢ rl
known principles by which their conduct will be 3ga
regulated, or the limits they will impose on their the
ambition. vift
It cannot be doubted but the agents and parti
zans of the French nation have long endeavored to ,
involve this country in the calamities of war ;
and finding that our national adminifiration could ft" 01
neither be influenced nor controled, they have l'e- the
duloufly attempted to alienate the confidence and
affe&ions of the people from it. To effeift thii j )av
purpose they have assailed the charaAer of the
late supreme Executive of our nation âa character J
precious to America, and which will be revered as c * a y
long aÂ» moral excellence shall be known andref- tlia
pe&ed by mankind. cd (
This nation has also refufed, with circumstances p rc
of indignity, to give audience to a minister lately
sent to them from this country, charged with the a l
most friendly embassy. v
Although we may be afTured that the Isnitcd con
States will wish to maintain the neutral ground (
which they have wifely assumed, and will depre- ma
cate the calamities of a war ; yet, under such an
accumulation of untoward circumstances, has it 1
not becemtour duty to prepare for a serious state ot
things ? Tel
Should matters be brought to the last neceflity, w h
we cannÂ©t doubt but the Genius of A merica, that ;
Genius which the Almighty inspired to vindicate j . â 
our liberties and assert our independence, will ex- ]^ U '
crt itfclf with the most a&ive energy, and wiil j ed
convince the world that America, determined to be his
free, will never dispute about the qu*lijic*tions of a
master.
We are happy in our confidence in the wisdom â .
and rsdtitude of the person to whom the national 1
executive power is at present committed. His * *
wisdom and stability has been often manifeftcd,
upon most important and trying occasions, in lup
port of the liberties, the honor and independence
of Â©ur country ; and we have the fatisfailion to
hnow that foreign influence had no share in his ap-
pointment. **
There has been a diversity Â©f opinion concern- T
ing the relative rank of fÂ©me of the militia, from fp,
whence inconveniencies have resulted. To obviate
uncertainty in this refpeA, I would recommend to
the consideration of the legislature the expediency rr *
of ascertaining by an a<st of government, the mi
litary rank, so far as it is not already established by
the grades of effcee.
To whatever conclusions, gentlemen, your deli- aa
beratiÂ©ns shall lead, to promote the interest, happi- Â£
ness and security of the state, you will please to be
alTured, will meet with my most hearty concur- P r
rence, and that I shall be happy to render you every Si
assistance in my power, to facilitate the bufinefsof ar
the session.

VITHEREAS I am informit! that twp bonds
W given by nic to btockiey Donelfon in
July in the year 1795, for about lix thousand
one hundred and ten pounds V;r s :nia curren
cy each, have been transferred by the laid Do
nelfon and others, and that it is intended to of
fer the said bonds for sale at audlinn j I think
it ray duty to inf. rm the public, what the
circumflances are under which the said bonds
were given, and leave those who.are in poffsflion
of them, or to \vho>n they may be offered, to
judge of the probability of their being paid.
In June 1795, Samuel Love, Jofiah Watson
and myfejf entered into contrail that I should
go to the S. Western Territory (now the state
of Tennessee) for the purpose of making a
purchase of lands ia that country ; the terms
on which the purchase was to be made, were
defined in our agreement, and fifteen days by
stipulation were giveÃ said Samuel Love and
Jofiah Watson, after I should inform them of
any purchases I Ihould make to determine whe
ther they would be partners in it.
I made a purchase of lands of the said Stock
ley .Donelfon but not on the terms, to which I
was limited by the said agreement with Samuel
Love, Jofiah Watson and myfelfâand although
the purchase exceeded in price, and was not
on the credit agreed on, I thought the bargain
a good one, and supposed Samuel Love and
Jofiah Watson would join me in it. I there
fore signed bonds for the payments, in the fame
manner as I should have done, if I had been cer
tain Mr. Love and Mr. Watson would have ra
tified and confirmed them ; because I did not
chufeas I meant to give them an option of tak
ing part of the said lands, to become solely re
sponsible for the payments, if they should de
termine to accept my offer of part. On my
return those gentlemen refufed to be concerned
at all in my purchase, and at I had received
the deeds jointly in our names, they when re
quested immsdiately conveyed to me, so that
I flood wholly possessed of the lands, and solely
responsible for payments.
At the time I made the pnrchafe of Mr. Do
nelfon, I informed him with whom and in what
manner I was concerned, and that Mr. J>ove
and Mr. Watson becoming responsible for the
payments, depended entirely on themselves.
The purchase I made Was to the amount of
upwards of 70,000 dollars, one thousand dol
lars were paid in cash, fix thousand dollars in
sixty day bills, and upwards of twenty thou
sand dollars in goodsljhe fall following the pur
chase. The two .bonds above alluded to were
given, ene payable in October ninety-fix, the
other in OiSober ninct.y-feven. Thole two last
bonds were given on the conditions expressed in
an agreement delivered at the fame time, and
dated the fame day with the said bonds, the
substance of which is, that the said bonds were
not to be paid, or any part thereof until it ap
peared to the fatisfailion ef the obligors, that
all incumbrances of Jevery nature and kind
whatfoevtr were removed from the lands and
every part thereof, which 1 had purchased of
Mr. Donelfon More than one half of the
lands, and ihofeef the best quality, the Indian
claim is not yet extingiiiihed to, and poffefiion
cannot of course be taken of them.
This incumbrance, perhaps, it was expeiled
when the contrail was made would be removed,
before the said bonds or either of them became
due.
There are other obstacles of less magnitude,
which must be removed before either of the
said bonds will be paid.
At the time the said bonds were given it was
agreed by Mr. Donelfon that he would not dis
pose of them, until it was clearly known that
there were no incumbrances on the lands. It
is not necessary, I should fay, how, he has been
induced to violate this part of our agreement.
I have complied with' the agreements on my
part to be done, agreeable to the letter and
meaning of my contrail, and shall continue to
comply with my contrail on the plainly-ex
pressed and unequivocal terms on which it was
made. Any person interested in the payment
of the said bonds may have cn application a
copy of the coanter agreement herein alluded
to. I have only to add, that I was very much
surprized in a short time after the said bonds
were given to be applied to, to know if they
would be paid ; at that time and whenever af
ter I have been spoken to on the fubjeil, I have
informed those applying of the nature of the
circuniftances on which the payment depended,
and I have never failed to declare in the moll
free and unreftrifled manner the true nature
of my enagements with Mr. Donelfon.
