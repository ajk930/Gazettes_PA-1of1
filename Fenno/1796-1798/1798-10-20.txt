The Paris papers represent Talleyrand ' '

proof of the pacific disposition of the French ; '

paring the mild tone *}f this letter with the 1
arrogint language of the preceding notes, 1
writU 1 by the fame minister, ss well as the
hoitile proceedings of France with the ener
gy displayed by Congress, to maintain its '
independence, and r.onfidering also what
France ha# to apprehend from a uuion be
tween England and the United States, we
can only discover in it the fhameful retreat 1
of a government which was insolent as long 1
as it thought itfeif feared : but which has
Junk into raieannefs and infignificance, the '
moment it was opposed in a manly manner,
and'its treacherous and insidious policy laid
open to the world.
It appears, from th evidence given in the
late trial for high treason, in Ireland, that
Talleyrand Psrigord was to have affilled the
revolutionists in that country. The dou
ceur which he was to .have received for his
lervices has not yet been disclosed
Ltttersfrom Paris of the 30th July give
reafoti to believe that another revolution is
preparing there. Tbe jacobins have not
forgiven their lad explosion from the coun
cils and they are stirring up all their friends
to change the face of affairs. They have
began to attack the diredtwy by a motion
in the council of five hundred, to deprive '
them of their power over the jourrtalifts '
This motion will probably be carried in one
of the ftrft fittings. The direÂ£lory, on their '
fide, [allow the r old maxim, and put to '
death a great number of roya ifls in o:Â«!er
to fiigh'en the jacobins.
The armies quarrel about thf words ci
tizen and mor-fn ur. Some soldiers will not
give up the monlieur, others will be called
citizens. At Evreux, in Normandy, the
firft regiment of dragoons, having quareled
with the municipality, was ordered to dÂ«-
part. They obeyed the summons ; but
when they set off, a great number of sol
diers cried Vive le Roi ! God save Louis
XVIII! They have not been punished.
The armies are very much in want of re
cruits, but nothing can induce the citizens
returned to their hom's to rejoin. The mi
r.ifter at war complains of it very bitterly.

The Address of the Young men of Phi

of May la!t, with his anfuvrthereto, have
been copied into the Parig Jiurnah, from
different London prints.
The affairs of this country, which had so
long been passed Over in tilent negledt
most of the French jonrnnl'fts, begin now to
attract their eager attention. paper
contains fomethrng relative to Am-rica.
1 hey affeft, however, to entertain the most
contemptuous id'.'as of our power and rc
fources; and uniformly aifplay 3 coufuniate
ignorance of the real (late of the coun'ry,
its politics and views, its spirit, and means
j of resistance to their schemes of tyranny
. and opprelfiort.
In the insulting letter of Brune, the
' French plenipotentiary, to the Sardinian j
miniiler, he tells him he ha 3 uttered
exprjflions and afferttons repugmrt to those
Ample virtues which are the pride of the
! French nation.
The <virtues of whfch France has made a ;
display towards th- poÂ»r Sardinians, and to
! every other nation, are indeed Jimple to 3
! fault. There is not in nature a more simple,
j nor at the lame time a more republican vir
| tue than self love : But there is not in
] the long catalogue, one whose operations
; are more powerful. It has led the Grande
| Republique a fairy dance round the globe; i
| and in the midst of her vagariei, ha* eui- j
braced within its extended confines, the ci
devant monarchy of Sardinia. The royal
pageant, tired, like the reft of the world,Â«
with herfmple virtues,cries out tte qitiduimis. j
Ard this is very repugntnt to those notions I
of honour and gOod faith, and those finite j
virtues, of which the RepuMic is so proud.

From the language held by the .council
of five hundred it would appear, that in va
rious diftrifts cf France, th# Royalilts,
though so often believed to be extirpated,
are ftiil numerous and formidable.
In the Council of 500, on the 20th July,
Gourlay, as organ of a special committee,
made report on the uecefity of ethblifhing
a new capital for the department of l'as dc
Calais; " for," said he, " the administra
tors, in the town where they now affemblc, 1
finiing themfÂ»!ves in the midst of the poign
ards of the Roya ids, are exposed to the'
greatest dangers,"
In the cafe of a coietelled eleetion, Blin ,
states lo the council, that the dispute ori
ginated with the royalists in the primary
assembly. " The signatures to the petition
against the eleftioa, he fays, are either of
the municipal officers, turned out by the
DiresÂ»ry aftef the 18th Fruftidor, or others
in public employ expelled after that epoch
for inciyifm, or of members, of a pretended
constitutional circle, whose objeA is te ai-nul
the clcftions of year 6, as it had done those
of year 5. But the eietted are men agreeable
tÂ» government, and consequently ebaoxious
to the petitioners,"
Preparations were making at Portsmouth,
N. H. on the 12th in!l. to celebrate on the
19th the Birthday of President Adams.
The papers relating to the negotiation of
our late envoys to France, having found
their way into the Frankfort Journals, and
the Courier du Bas Rh'tn, cannot fail of
penetrating into France; so that in fp'ite of
the flav-ry of the Prtfs in France, the whole
of that fccne of loathsome ,\iid attrocious
iniquity will, to the great joy of all good
men, be laid open to the French pÂ«Â»pie.
A late Dublin paper contains the follow
ing paragraph : âlt is said, and we believe
truly, that a certain noble earl (Moira) has
fairly and candidly acknowledged his error,
in fa far as he has, unwittingly, abetted the
designs of treason ; and as the best repara
tion for his mistake, has determined, as ear
ly as possible, to Rate public!? in both king
doms the reasons on which he has altered
his opinion.

In addition to the circumllancts which we
yelleniay tlated, we are enabled to add the
following, from the best foarces of informa
tion.
The French frigates failed from Roclic
fort about a fortnight ago, and are supposed
to be the fatjie which were mentionetl in
our Plymouth letter, iuferted 011 Wednes
day the 16 h in(l. on the authority of the
crew of La Valliant, a French corvette, tak
en by h s majesty's {hip Indefatigable, of
44 guns, as having failed for lieland. The
naii.es of those veffcls were dated to be La
Medee, La Concord,, and La Francois.

The prep irations for war, on the part of (
the French, are without example, even since
the revolution. The troops are filin" off
towards the river Nida, and if we may judge i
from appearance*, war wtli again be renew- 5
ed between the Emperor ant! the French
republic, in which cafe it is generally sup- j
pvfcJ the king of Pruflia will take an aÂ£liye a
part.

Berlin, Aug. 7.
The commandants of the Pruflian army a
or demarcation have granted leave of ab
fence to a number of fcldiens, which is a '
proof that war is Co near at hand as expected,
for it is not customary for a naticfti to weak- j.
en hcrfelf in presence of an enemy.

PROPOSALS, lb,
BY THE ' ! n
Insurance Company of North America.!
For Insdramci against FiaÂ», on Dwelling- 1 f
Houses, Ware-Hcufcs, and other Buildings (and â¢ "
on Goods contained in such Buildings) difiant from j P
Philadelphia, ill the United States. I 11
d
I. Common lufurance*, on hazards of the firft 1 (
class, will be undertaken at a premium of ahout p
hali per cent. per annum. For'extra hazardous ' t
rifqÂ»es a larger prrrrinm will be required, which o
will vaiy according to circunftances, fcidom ex- j d
teeding one per cent, per annum ; but in some i-n- c
fiances, where the property insured is not only in
itfelf extra hazardous, but rendered still more so t
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and j
occupations, the premium demanded be railed f
according to rircumftanc&s.
Houses and Ware-Hc,ufes, the vails and pcrti- t
tions of which arc wholly Â»f ft one or brick, well
conftru&ed, so as tÂ» be guarded as well as may be
against fires from within, and tree from extra ha
zardous buildings and occupations in their neigh-
borhood, will be deemed hazardous of the firft
class, and may be insured to their full value.
Also Good* and Merchandize, not o! an extra _
hj7n r dcus kind, in calks, bales, or packages, 4e-
Ktpofitcd in such buildings, to an ameunt not ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; bat if more than thisfum 1
â Required to be insured in one tenement, an sjdic
TWR<wal premium will be required, in proportion to t
circumllances.
11. Insurances will also be made on buildings and J
good* extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned (
to thri risque. But it is not e:.fy to arrange these (
under particular heads cr classes, so as to describe f
each with the necessary accuracy. Bach cat- niuft
therefore be decided upop according to thecireum- r
fiances a tending it ; and these circumstances wili, a
in general, appear from the description accotnpa- f
uymg t'eapplication. a
Buildings partly conftrucled of brick or stone, f
are preferable to thofo wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the stile of buiWin~, how they are oc- i
cupied, how they are fitunted, the neighboring a
buildings, and how occupied, arc considerations to a
be taken into view. And with refpeA t# goods, -
their tendency, whether from their nature, or r
from the rnanoer in which they are exposed, c ther t
to commence or to increase an accidental fire, and i
tlicir liability in such state to receive damage by i
wet, or by sudden and hasty removal, or to be fto- 1
len iu time of confufion and hufry, are all cir- c
cumft&nces of weight; and the premiums mutt be 1
proportioned accordingly. i
HI. The fallowing conditiont are to be under- ,
flood hy the parlies. ' t
:f:. The Insurance is not binding till the ftipu
latsjpremium belaid ; but it (hall be deemed ef- i
fedlual from the time of such payment and accep- 1
'.â¢â¢dice thereof, whether the policy be immediately c
finned or not.
ad. Infurincts may be renewed at the expira- <
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex- 1
petlfes than the payment of the premium of the re
newed term, the circumstances continuing the fame t
as they were underilood by the Infurtrs at the time J
the former insurance was made ; but the payment c
of the premium is eflential to such renewal; and I
it the party insured fuffers any time to elapfc after j
the expiration ef the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured j
during such time ; nor can the insurance be renew- c
eel on the former policy but by computing the t
conimtr.ceir.ent of the renewal from the expiration c
of the former insurance. The lubjedl of ihfur- j
a'ice may nc'.erthclcls be open to treaty for a new (
insurance. \
jd. If spy other insurance he made on the fame 1
property ; itmuft be made known at the time of (
application, otherwise the policy made on such ap
plication will be void. i
jth Goods held in trust, or on consignment, i
ray be insured as such in a separate policy; but t
th\> are not Wbe'cohljderefi Ss irifufed vtheraafe. j
Jth, This cotnpany will not liahiu or aeceun- <
tabk'for any loss or damage occafiorvrd by any for- r
invafion, or ty any military or usurped force
or hy pc.,fon of any ci\il commotion ; oroccafion, t
eel. by gunpowder, aquafortis dr other thing of thÂ» c
like kind kept in the building, or amonglt the pro
perty insured. t
fcln. Bills of Exchange, Bonds and other Secu
rities Title Deads, Money. Bank and other pro- c
mifiory Notes, are not included in any insurance ; f
nor are paiÃtings, medals, jewels, gems, antique
curio'itios, or mirrors exceeding the value of twen
ty-live dollars-each, to be considered as insured une i
less particularly mentioned and by special agree

e being the outlet of the Seneca-lake, the mill cau
never Vc in want of water- \ and as it has bÂ«en kept

a handsome income, which must be increasing and

a course by land and water, the GenefTee ftateroad
- palling through it, as well as all water carriage to
