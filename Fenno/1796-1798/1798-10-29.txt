For Insurance against Fn*, on Dwelling-

on Goods contained in such Buildings) distant frofn

L Common lufurancet, on haZanls of the firft
elals, will he undertaken at a premium of ahout
hali per c nt. per annum. For extra hazardous '
rifqaes a larger preirMm will be required, which .
will vai y according to feidom ex
teeding one per cent, per annum ; bat ifl some in- i
Handei, where the property insured ianot only in
itfclf ex'ra hazardous, but rendered still more so
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and
occupations, the premium demanded will be raised
according to Arcumftances.
Houses and Ware-Houses", the wailÂ»-and parti
tions of whioh are wholly of stone or brick, well
eonftnnfted, so as to be guarded as well as may be
agaihft fires irom within, andlrte from extra ha
larddut buildings and occupations in their neigh

class, and may be insured te their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not o an extra
hazardous kind, in calks, bales, or packages, de
lÂ»Â°fitcd in flich buildings, to an amount not ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; bat if more than thwfum
Â«s required to be insured in one tenement, an addi*
tional premium will be required, in proportion to
â¢trcuinftances.
11. Insurances will also be made on buildings and
goods , xtra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to tljit risque. But it is Mot easy to arrange these
â¢mier particular heads or clafTes, so as to describe
each with the neceflary accuracy. Each cafr mull
therefore be dccidcdupon according to the circum
ftanccji tending it; and these circumfiances will,
in general, appear from the description accompa
nying the application.
Buildings partly conftru&ed of brick or (lone,
ah: preferable to those wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the stile of building, how they are oc
cupied, how they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how occupied, are csaQderations to
be taken into view. And with refpeit tÂ« goods,
their tendency, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, either
to comnfence or to increase an accidental fire, and
their liability in firch (late to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden and hafly removal,- or tÂ» be ito
len in time of confufion and hurry, are all cir- I >
eumftances of weight; and the premiums mufl be
proportioned accordingly.
IHÂ» The fallowing copditiont are to be ander
ftood by the parties.
rft. The Insurance is not binding- till the stipu
lated premium be paid ; bat it {hall be deemed ef
feclual ivtitn the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately
signed or not.
Â«H. Insurances may he renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
penseÂ« than the payment of thÂ« premium of the re
newed term, the circumftancescontinuing the fame
as they were understood by the Insurers at the time
the former insurance was made ; but the payment
of the premium is efTential to such renewal; and *
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after 1
the Expiration of the former insurance, before he
, pays a prem iuirt for the renewal, he is not insured *
during futh time ; nor can the insurance be renew- c
ed an the former policy bnt by computing the 1
commencement of the renewal frÂ»m the expiration c
of the former insurance. The fubjeCl of in fur- F
ance may nevertheless be open to treaty for a new
jnfurance. v
3d. If any other insurance be madeon the fame "]
property ; it mud be made known at the time of 1
application, ntherwifc the policy made on such ap
plication will be void. ,!
4th Goods held in trull, or on confignmant, n
rway be iitfured as such in a separate policy; bnt 'â¢
they arc no; tÂ« be considered as infuied atherwtife. P
,?th. This comp.,t.y will not be liable or accoun- C
tahle for any loss or damage occafiom-d by any lor- n
tlgn invafmn, orbysmy military or usurped force
or by Fesifon of any civil commotion ; or occasion, ''

perty iufured. U
6th. Bills of Exchange, Bonds and other Secu
rities, Title D#jds, Money, Bank and other pro- 8
miliary Notes, are not included in any insurance ; f u
nor ue paintings, Tedals, jewels, gems, antique
aUrioiÃties, or mirrorS exceeding the vulae of t\rta- _
ty-five dollarseach, to be conÂ£dercd as insured une j
less particularly mentioned aid by fpecialagiee- i

7th. No insurance will be made for* (better ( ]_
term than one year, nor for a longer terra than fe- 1 OI
vev, years. Persons choosing to mfare for seven j T
years lhall b eallowed one year's premium by way |
of difeount; One third of a yeartpremium shall I ns

:d Ononuago, Ind state of New-Yqrk, on the Banks
fe of the Seneca-river, two tnile.s weft of the Cayuga
>e ferry, and eleven miles eafl oi Gancva.
ft This ertAlilhment confiils of an excellent grift
>- mill, saw mill, dwelling houie, barn, and a port
i, age or carrying place, with between thirty and
i- forty acres of land, under good improvement, and j
as much more hi the vicinity, as maybe required
c, for future improvement.
n The grill mill h a. handsome, newand Well fin
iflied building, of 50 by 30 feet, 3 (lories high
g and lurnifhed with a run of excellent Burr stones
0 and another of Efopas' stones, as the bell quality
s, âand tile most appraved bemits, &c. calculated to
,r make all the different qualities of flour for expur
â r tation or for home consumption : Itisacceffible by
d water from every part of the Cayuga lake and Se
y neca-river, as well as from the Seneca-lakeâand
from its situation, commands a veryextenfive and
â¢_ encrealing dllom : The ltream on which it (lands,
ie being the outlet of the Scneca-lake, the mill cau
never htm want of water ; and as it has been kept
â¢â working during the fesfcreJl feafot: of the lall win
ter, it is not liable to be impeded by freft :
The saw mill is also new, situated on the fame
dream, now furniflied with an ample flock of
t- logs, of which a supply may at all times be pro
y cured by land or water, of the bed quality :
The dwelling house is well calculated for the use
. of the miUer, is new, and fufÃciently lat ge : The
barn iÂ» about 40 feet fifuare, and entirely new :
The portate is 3-4thsof a ruilr in length, along
e the Seneca-fallsâover which were pa/fed in the
e 'aft year, nearly two hundred boats with their
t contents ; this. objeA is already produ&ive of a
d handsome income, which must.be incrcafing and
r permanent:
e Among the many advantages of thisfituation,
1 must be numbered the fertility of thefurrounding
. countryâbeing the baft improved part of the coun
e ty of Onondagaâthe concentration cf inter
, coarse by land and water, the Geneffee (lateroad
. palling through it, as well as all water carriage co
, Geneva, and the counties of Ontario and Steuben ;
which renders it a most eligible llaad for a Store or
. TavernâThe river and lakes abound in fifh and
f lowl, and the country with deer and other game*.
Besides the mills already ereiScd ai this place, it
is calculated for any additional water works that
, maybe found necessaryâFulling mill, balk mill
t tannery, forges, &c. may be erected at a f.-nall ex
penceâlron ore may be brought in boats irom the
. Cayuga lake ; and it is thought to abound in the
. neighborhood.
