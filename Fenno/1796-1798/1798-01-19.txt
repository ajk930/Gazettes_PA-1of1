' " Our yw philosophers likewise teH us,
1 that "it is absurd for one generation to {c
11 chooft a forra of govfrnment for awather,
or for any generation to make laws for pof- |;
terity ; and therefore no succeeding gener- te
j ation is bonnd to adhere to that government fu
which their fathers set up, nor to submit to tr
' any rulers whom themselves have notccho w
e fen."âBut if this doftrine is once admit
e ted, there is an end to all government, of
Â® all commerce, and of all lociety, civil and e i
religious. If men could not choose a go- nr
-> make laws for posterity ; then p
1 of every nation, behoved to be changed ev-
ery day. Every day almost a thosfand per- Q
I sons die in Britain ; an .equal number are el
born ; and some hundreds at least come of a
age. He that comes to age to day may
!* fiyâ" I never consented to the form of go
vernment now fubflfting ; I never had any
' voice in the choice of the ruling powers, *
or hfthfe flrtkittg fcf any laws.' 1 will there
e fore be fubjeft to no laws til] I' myftlf have a it
e part in the making of them ;.nor will I fiib- ii
e mit to< any government, till I, in conjunc- w
s tion with my cotemporaries, have framed a 0
constitution for ourselves." He that comes '
0 of age to-morrow may argue in the fame
manner, and'iofift for a general couventipn, t ]
in which he (hall have a voi.ee, by himfelf b
!" orhis representative, before he will fubmtt
y to any government or any law whatsoever- f"
II Surely then, we /hall have conventions and
conftitutions in great abundance ! v
â ) Â«Â« Neither scripture nor reason give an ex
.' clufive fanftion to any particular form of t]
government. Owing to the differences of t
national charafter, of fituatioit, and pur- o
suits, one kind of government may be pro- 11
jj." per among one people, and a different con- 6
ftit'uti*>n may be better adapted to the cir-
t eumftances'' of another. Thus, a mixed ,
government "has been found most congenial 1
to the people of Britaiu : perhaps a repÂ»>b" t
u lican government is more adapted to the cir- 1
j eumftances of oui brethren in America : :
e . and from recent events, it may be fufpefted,
5 that hard as their situation was, while the
king's wtH-vras their lawj monarchy "is the
le only g'jvcintr.ent suited to the constitution
levity and ferocity of our neighbors in
France. There have been instances of 11a
, ticf-.s flourifhing and happy under different
L forms of government. And every govern
,ci"* ment is capable of degenerating iuto tyran
lca ny, oppression, and anarchy in the hands of
a corrupt adininiftration. Hence there is a
0 r great deal of truth in Mr. Pope's maxim,

A GHOST.
New-Goal, (in the Fields J Jan. I*, 1798
A true and furpriling account of the apparition
er ghost of a woman, that has appeared seve
ral nights past in the New-Goal, to the great
terror and affright of the prisoners, many of
whom are ready to confirm the truth of it on
oath.
Cap!, Fish declares thnt for several nights
pad, the apparition of <a woman has hiunted
ths goal from room to room, this and the last
week, followed and encircled by a radiant light,
drefTed in a white flowing rabe and a turban on
her head, seemingly of a pleasing but deje<fted
cauntenance, Cspt. Fish declares that about
twelve o'clock on Friday night this apparition
~-~n t Oi t 'if and drew the curtains, Iook
"rr- if! jJ? l 1 '' m f ' :r foÂ»ne time, which so
: run to' he atijured her in the name
ot the Father, Son,and -fjwn him
who she was, or why (he caine in " so queftiona
Me a (tape," when-ihe casting a look of fwrrow,
accompanied with most iruffaUe sweetness
gradually disappeared in the fight of several o
thtr prifeners vÂ»ho were in ths room, and are
ready to teftify the trntli of what is here ad
vanced.
Mr. Miller another debtor in the ftmt Voem,
going to the upper hall, about one in ihe morn
ing, was met by the fame woman who pulled
him by the eoa> ; which so alarmed and fright
ened him that he flood petrifird as a statue ;
when he came a little to hlinfelt he fiw her
gradually advance to ths window, from which
she vanished. He then called to the watchman
to ask him if he had seen it, he declared lie did,
and that he had seen it variifb from the fame
window several nights fucceflively.
Mr. Miller fu-ther declares, that after she was
gone, a large globe of fire of the most beautiful
and diverfined colours rolled up and down the
hall for the fpaeeoffive minutes ; and then of
a sudden burst with a dreadful explosion, which
rition ; when making but one step from the top.
of the flairs to the bottom, he recovered his
room, in a condition of undefcribable terror.
The Friday following Mr. Evans, being a
sleep in his bed, was suddenly awakened by
something drawing open the curtains of his bed,
when he perceived the figure of a beautiful wo
man, arrayed in white, looking fleadfaftly on
him, which much alarmed him ; he communi
cated his fear to another man who was in the
fame bi d with him, who alfofaw it with terror
and aftonifhmtnt- It continued a considerable
time by the bedfidr in a contemplative pofturn,
often putting her band on the left fide of her
robe, which seemed to be tinged with blood,
and then he ving a deep sigh, vanished through
the 'wall.
Mr. Hevvit a few evenings after this, in
the dead of the night being alarmed in his
sleep, suddenly leaped out of bed, and the
firft thing presented to his view was the ap
parition of this woman, who with the most
placid countenance seemed tÂ» claim his pity;
but frightened to the greatest degree at so
uncommon an appearance, and fear doling
his power of utterance, lie leaped again in
to bed, covering himfelf over head and ears,
with every particle of the bed furniture that
was within hisgrafp. In a few minutes af
ter, this apparition di fappeared, which was
accompanied by a solemn, hollow, rumbling
rioife. leaving him in " The utmost exacer
bation of human terror."
The prisoners in general further declare,
that almost every night about twelve o'clock
there appears a large ball of fire at intervals,
which illuminates every room in the gaol
for a time.
" l)oo*nd for a curtain terto to wait tht Hight,
Andfor tbr day confin dt* fÂ«JI in fit.n,

Those who believe in the Spe&re of the

the views of John Stewart, the traveller,
who goes from town to town, reading phi'-
lofoyhical romantes, /ar money. The man
of reflexion fees in the fir(t cafe, the arti
fice of debtors who wifla to get out of con
finement, or of a child defirovis of obtain

crite, with a tone of humility aud benevo

by them, particularly by the leftures.
When the revolution threatened France,
and ever since that country has been torn to
pieces by it, there have been, and still con
tinue to be numbers of these public preach
ers, of these travelling mountebank quacks
who under pretext of enlightening the hu
man mind, inspired it with fanaticifn), and
formed many a political cut-throat. They
demonstrated the perfeftibility of man!!! â
But they (hewed at the fame time that this
desirable, and in their opinion, pra&icable
elevation could net be attained but by re
forming existing institutions. A fanciful
piiiure placed at a great diftatice* magical
ly exhibited the advantages to be gained by
a change of habits, and a renovation of the
political fyflem. The deceived hearer, till
then a good man, became enthusiastic for
the imaginary good, heated by degrees, and
turned out a demoniac. In his holy deliri
um, he seized a site-brand, or arm ed himfelf
with a dagger, and smote his father, the
throne, or the altar.
If is thusâlt is by means like these, that
ambitious men on one fide, and philtfophers on
the other, have murdered Louis XVI. and
France. For wljofe benefit? FÂ«r their
own, ftnee tbey reign in hiÂ§ (lead, without
having bettered the circufnftances of the

. Pepel king of Bonney, who is perhaps
one of the most extensive dealers in human
flefh which the world can produce, was so
much incensed at the profpeft of an aboli
tion that he thus addrcfled a Liverpool cap
tain.
" Why you no catchee dat Wilbafoce ?
why you no bringee to Pepel ? I soon do
umâl foonmakeeknow whyhepoil trade."
The captain told him that it was impossi
ble to comply with his request as the cust

. so very different.
| " Well," exclaimed the monareh, " sup
