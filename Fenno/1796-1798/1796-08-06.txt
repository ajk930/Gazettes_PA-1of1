his pstnotiCm, his ardent love for liberty, equality, 1
ae. &c. From the age of sixteen," fays he, " the !

sii innate aptitude for philolophical principles; 1 bum

Mr. Cowan,
IN reading over a late paper, I met with-tht
following address to the people of the United
States. Ac the fcÃtimenU and warning it contains
are applicable to the citizens of our diftrift, as well
as to those of other dillrifts in the Union, I re
queil you, Sir, to publilh it in your Heiald, for
the attentive confrderation of our fellow-citicens.
1 am, Sir,
your humble servant,
A SUBSCRIBED,
July 21, 1796.
TO THE PEOPLE OK THE tWi-t-SD STATES.
THERE are prevailing iiWiis country two pars
ties of very opposite sentiments. But without
tracing them through all the drftinÂ£tions by which
they have refpeftively been known, it is fufficient
to observe, and it is greatly important for every
citizen to bÂ» informed, that one paity is exerting
all its endearots to involve the United States in
the calamities of wfcr, and that t! e other party is
wifely, a.id I trust fuceefsfuHy, employed in pre
serving our peace and happi.iefs, To men, well
acquainted with the true situation of our public
. affairs, this information is unnecessary ; but too
" many of the people are inattentive to political obÂ«
j jeils, an 3 appear unconfciaus of their danger. Be
e ing thjemfclves in the pofiifiion of all the iik-lfings
which a good government wifely ad|RÂ°niltered has v -
bellowed, they t!o not imagine that tutbulent and
' seditious men furroond them, and labour to destroy
j- their repose. And yet the better to deceive them
into this fataj.fecurity, rtiefc turbulent and ambi
tious men burrow the language of patriotism, and
hypocritically aflume the rhara&er of'patriot*. But
these blcflings, dear and interesting as.they are, are
t heldat present by nothing but a thrsad : For tvliile
the war rages in Europe, be affitretl the situation
of this country will remain imminently critical,
j- The continuance of that terrible war, famous for
the dcftiuflion of man, Ifceps alive the hopts of
J this malignant .party ; and they flill expefl, by ar
tince and fraud, to. make us partake in all its hor
]) rors.
j Let those, then, who are really the friends of
I peace, look around them, a,nd make themselves in
u quifitive about the temper and chara&er of every
candidate for office : The ensuing tle&ions for
w members of the Hotife of Reprefeiitativea in Coa
grels will lequire all the caution and fortitude of
I which the human micd is capable. Ctizens, he
r carelul liuw you dispose of your fuffragesâ patile
f for a moment, and conliderjiow you turn out, and
, r how you put in. Inquire minutely into the pub
s lie coftdutl of those -ho have served you alreadv :
Do not judge of them by this or that particular in-
I Itance, but by the general tenor and complexion,
of their political attions. If you find that your
merrber has sided with the partizans of war, and
has fought to *' flop the wheels of government"
a j and irtibarrafs the honeil views of our worthy Pre
,r (ident, turn him out without rclpeit to his person,
â  2nd eleii the friend of peace. If 011 the contrary
your present member has invariably supported lite
k" measures of peace, and united hi 3 endcav*>s to
prefei vc amity between the United Ssves and other
nations, be sure to run 110 hazcrdââ 4e sure to re
(â _ elctt him ; you arc ccrtain by repeated trials,that

r RICHARD CHAINING MOORE,
New-York, July 2<?th, 1796, t
Sir,
' IT is true that a fever resembling the one \vhiih
proved so great a fcourg; to our city the last yeat,
' made its appearance about Whitehall, and in the. :
vicinity of the Exchange, early in this month j
y but fortunately for us, from a concurrence of hap
-1 py events, the fever has entirely fublided. It had
1 continued Cut a Short time only, wheii it plealed a
1 Gracious Providence, to fer.d us hard" winds, re*
' peatcd thunder and Ifghtninp, inundations of isin,-
' and ceol weather. To these cauhs i think we may
afcriVie the fufpenfiou of a formidable cifeafe which
had began to ihew its.-IF amongst us. And fhoulA
it return again, I have fwlid reaLns to believe that
? it will not be extended beyond certain limits,
Yot} may recoiled that in Ihe frequent conÂ»erfaÂ»
5' tions we have had 011 the fubjeft ot the Wt yeai's
* fever, I have been uniform in my opinion, as tp the
f" caufesof its production, namely, the accumulation
3 of every fpeciesof/filih an<t pitiiiliible matter, oft
v ~ the low, new grounds on the south tide of the
3 city, and the abominable odora of filling up flips
1 jtnd docks \vi:!i similar materials: I have said that
116 such cnufes, aided by a moid atmosphere ?nd a hot
e ' fun, would not fail of producing the most baneful
exhalations, and that their effedls must neceflarily
be felt by those who are more immediately cxpgjed
to their influence.
The proprietors of the lots on tfce eafl fide of
White Hall Slip, carried out a bulk head the last
ri- spring, with a view to extend the dock farther into
in. the river. Thedimenfioiis of the dock are very
,td coufiderable | and a maxim invariably adopted by
ire the owners of the docks, is, that the cheapest mode
he of filling up is the fecit ; accordingly carts were (
of employed to colled such dirt and filth as all large
ter and populous cities fu'nifh in abundance ; and'
Dii with materials of this description wbs the dock
ia, filled up, and to give greater salubrity to the
as- there were occasionally added, dead horles, dogs*
&c. &c.
The exposure' of Whits-Hall, and indeed the
:ch whole of the weft end of the city must be canfiders'
iti- ed fas naturally extremely healthy. The winds du-"
;he ring the warm season, are commonly from the Â£ea,
and arrive at tbis part of the town uncontaminated
:>o- bv palling over no tjnwholefome grounds. Yet such
â ess is the fad, that the poisonous exhalations which
:m, have abounded in that quarter dtiring the warm
rht weather in the beginning of this-month, had far
'-ell changed the air, that the inhabitants on tha foutV
ihd fide of Pearl ttreet, between the Old-flip and Whito.
f a Hall, almost all concur in their teltimony, that the.
tjie difagrceable effluvia has frequently Ã¼bliged therrf,-
n'al especially in the evening, to close the windows on
>ar- the south fide of tfieir houses, and in ftveral inftan
to ce)gentlemen haveafruredus,that the oflFeufive fmeil
ge- has been such as to occasion vomitings.
Pa- The whatf on which Mr. Delalield's stores are
ereited, is in a state truly execrabl -, and the flip
but on the right and on the left, is in a cOÃditipÃ little
better, ThÂ«fe and such places are vitited by the
dock feverâthe yellow fever if you please, that
' murderer of our own creating. Were the proprie
tors of thefeand fbch like docks, compelled to live
ms in their vicinity, tht evil would soon be remedied j"
iry- but people of this description are generally fectire
1 of from the ravages of disease, in the cooler retirements
dif- of the country.
rnc- The present exertions of the common council, ia
giving!* new furfaoeofwholefome earth to thedock
lew at White-Hall, will no doubt be productive of the
but greatcft advaniages to the inhabitants of that part
be of the city | and it the fame measures were extend
vel- ed to other parts of the town, there would be much
ade less rsafon to apprehend a return of the do k-fever.
eral Thu6 fir, your are answered: you m ght
cd- have some to town with fafety j you may come to
his town with fafety. New York, as I have laid be
fore, may be rendered as healthy a city as any i.n
derthe fun ; and when a more rigid police prevails,
