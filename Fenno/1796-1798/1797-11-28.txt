For the Gazette of the United Stales.
7 0 the author of an address under the signature
oj Auother Subscriber, in the Gazette of
the United States of the 22d injl.
S 1 R,
An invincible attachment to candor, and
to truth, a fincete refped for Dr. Wharton
"â¢as a man <f feience and a divine," and a
wish to fatisfy your mind withrefpeft tb my
motive for publishing the British Review of
his pamphlet, which you profef3 yourfclfi
"at some loss to determine," h5 ve induced me
to resume my pen.
That a falfe conclusion should result from
mistaken or imperfeil premifiss, is not to be !
wondered at. Had you perused the whole
of the pamphlet alluded to (which the gen
eral tenor of your address leads fne to sup
pose you have not) inflead of those ihort and
detached passages of it only, which the re- i
viewers have extrafted, I trust you would
not hare conceived that the sentiments of
it 3 iiVlhor " called fir the notice you have tat- ,
en of them," and cnnfequently that neither
vour utijuft and sarcastic refle&ions upon
him, " as a man offcicXte and a divine," nor
your flriftures upon the dottrines he advo
eates, would have been made.
Dr. Wharton by no means rejedts the o
pcration of human reason in religious inqui
ries. On the contrary, he tells his friend
to whom the pamphlet is addressed (page
12) "It was the laudable spirit of enquiry,
the difpofitien to fathom the divine truths
of religion as far as weak reason is fuffered
to penetrate, that confirmed the eiletm I
have long conceived for you, and raised it to
the name and dignity of friendfhip." Dr.
Wharton justly indeed, denies (with Mr.
JÂ«nkins, Dr. Horfeley, Bishop Butler, and
the Boyleian Ee&urers, quoted by you) the
competence, of human reason to decide upon
some points of the Christian Revelation, but
they â¢ arc those only which are above the
reach of its powers. "Truth," fays he,
(page 4) " is the only objeA of humjn re
searches and human reason : In whatever
shape or circumftauces it appe rs, it claims
our inward adherence or outward profeffion.
But in the investigation of revealed truths, it
must ever be remembered, that they lie be
yond the range and competence of reason.'"
He maintains it to be the office of reason
(ibid) " to examine and determine by what
authority the dei&rines of revelation come
recommended, or on what motives of credi
bility revelation itfelfis eflablifhed." But
that when once the authority and motivts
arc proved, and advnittedto be inconteftible
an implicit faith should be given to its asser
tions. That " revelation (ibid) implies
information of something which reason can
not discover, and therefore must be difFer
entfrom allthe deduftions ofreafon." "The
contradi&ions," for inftatice, (page 5)
" which are conceived by fotne to exist in
the religious system of those christians, who
admit three diftincl relations in the God
head, commonly called perfonfi, are not to
be measured by the standard of reason, by
those who believe the authority of the scrip- 1
tures ; because it must be evident to such, [
that many properties and attributes may '
exist in the divinity, which human reason is 1
utterly incapable of conceiving, and which
the divine wifdora nevertheless may have ;
judged proper to reveal." And again (page '
9) "The christian revelation was fintended
to reveal some truths, which human reason 1
C3n neither discover uor understand. A- j
nior.g these may be reckoned some proper
ties in the Godhead, and especially the di- 1
vine nature of the son and holy spirit. If
this divine nature be revealed as existing,
they who believe this revelation (or the Bi
ble) mnft admit it. Whether it be thus re
vealed or not, is the whole: ftibjeft of con
troversy between Dr. Priestley and his op
ponents."
This fubjeft, Sir, is, I think of too dig
nified a nature for a nevvf-paper difcuflion,
and therefore I shall not presume to enter
upon it myfelf in that mode. Myobjeft at
present is merely to rescue Dr. Wharton
and his pamphlet from misrepresentation and
unmerited eenfure. I believe every candid
peruser of the whole publication will ac
knowledge that the Dr. hks condensed with
in the compass of 59 o&avo pages, more
theological learning, and authoritative ar
guments in favor of Christ's Divinity, and
in my opinion of genuine Christianity, than
any other writer upon the fubjedl: and T
candidly acknowledge, that a wish to pro
mote its circulation among the people, or
as you fay" to procure a sale for it " (though
he can derive no advantage from such sale,
the copy-right to Messrs. Orm
rod and Conrad) induced me to pu'blifh the
Review ; which endeavour will, I doubt not
receive some degree of aid from your critique.
The other motive yoa suggest as probable,
is also true, viz. because I really look upon
the doftrinesof Unitarianifm tobedangernus
and unfcriptural. They are dangerous, be
cause they tend, by inflating the human
mind with extravagant ideas of its own pow
ers and abilities, to lessen or rather to de
stroy its confidenci in our great spiritual
physician, and the redemption which he
hath wrought for us ; and because by ex
tinguilhing that soothing and animating
hope which the doftrines of the divinity, vi
carious atonement and intercession of Christ
inspire, they annihilate the most refined and
sublime obligations of Christianity, and lead
dire&ly into Deism, from which comfortlefs
state, the transition to both speculative and
pra&'cal ath'eiftn is natural and easy. That
such in many instances has been the operati
on of Unitarianifni, melancholy experience
evinces. In England, 'tis well known that
many of its waimelt advocates, and even
those who were most conspicuous in its de
fence as authors, cr as preachers, soon re
linquifhed so feeble In, attachment to Chrifti- -
Â»niÂ«y, and finally rcafatted thcnvfelves into
the principles and profeffion of D:fm; nay,
some of them have advanced to the absolute
avowal of ttkfrn. I afft-rt this, not upon
the uncertain and bafeiefs principle of ftlr
rivife or vague report, but upon the solid au
thority ofunqueftionable information. Up
on the Continent of Europe we have seen a
striking example of the fata) influence of a
yowed Infidelity, and pra&icid Atheism, in
the entire subversion of regular government,
' the deftmftion of domestic, civil and nati
onal happiness, and the endeavour to render
the whole world, one mighty theatre of irre
ligion and discord, of rapine and cqnfufion.
In our own Country, where you fay its pro
gress may be traced for twenty years, and
particularly in this city where Unitarianifm
has been publicly inculcated, the moral cha
, ra&er of its inhabitants has indeed fuffered
a mod rapid and alarming degradation.
. That the doftrines of â¢ Unitarianifm are
unfcriptural, cannot I think be doubted by
those who devoutly and candidly "search
the scriptures." To those who are not fully
convinced by them, I recommend Dr.
Wharton's pamphlet, acd the letters of Dr.
Horfeley to Dr. Prieltly, the last of which
I believe Dr. Prieftlcy never thought proper
to answer.
From an opinion thus founded, I befitated
not to pronounce the principles opposed by
Dr. Wharton to be dangerous, unfcriptural
and malignant.
I (hall conclude this rejoinder with the
adoption of your own assurance, that I
fhduld not have taken up my pen, had I
not 'â¢ thought your language, and the sentiments
of Dr. Wharton called for the notice I have
taken of them"
A SUBSCRIBER.
Philadelphia Nor. 2jth 1797.
For the Gazette of /to United States.
MR. FENVO,
Having seen many observations on the
fubjeft. of the role d'equipage as required by
the French, particularly those in Mr.
Brown's papers ef Wednesday and Satur
day evenings, I beg leave to communicate
some remarks thereon, it being reprefentcd
as a paper ejjential to the fafcty of our (hips
and commerce.
By the 25th article of the treaty, " in
time of war" every vessel is required to have
" a sea letter or passport that thereby it (hall
appear that the vtffej really and truly belongs
to one or other of the parties, which "(hall be
according to the form annexed to this trea
ty"âthey are also to have certificates
Containingthefeveral particularsofthecargo,
&c. " which certificates (hall be made out
by the officers of the place whence thefhip
sets fail, &V."âand by the article it is
agreed that " having exhibited the sea letter
and passport See'."" the Ihip (hall not be mor
I'fled or put out of her intended course &c.â
Here then is the charge offlagrant inju/lice
eflablifhedâ thefea letter 13 declared to be the
evidence of property, for it is said thereby it
.shall appear : but if, no matter how it has
happened that the form is not sorredt, is the
veffcland cargo therefore tobecondemned: is
a neutral citizen and a friend to be deprived
of his property, ruined and plunged into
poverty for forms fake ? Suppose by accident
a (hip proeeeds on her voyage 'without her
regjter or any other paper whatever ; if met
| at lea (he is. certainly liable to be cariiedin
; tÂ® port, hut who will fay (he is liable to be
! condemned ? a reasonable time is to be al
lowed the captain or the agent employed by
him to claim the property to prove it, to (hew
! it really and truly belongs to one or other of the
partiesâhe is told in the language of the
1 law marine and of nations, " your prop
erty and your intentions are doubtful, clear
j up those doubts and have it again." When
I proof that the property is neutral is obtain
ed, it is certainly to be released and a pass
port granted for its protection against fur
ther molestation âfafety should be in the fa3s
not the form, but French fineffe by a shadow
has filched away the substance ! ! !
The certificates are made out " by the of
ficers of the place whence the (hip set fail" ;
who then is to prescribe the form ? is it the
government of the nation whence (he de
parts, or of any other ?
I'he matter is to swear to the property
and that " he will keep and cause to be kept
the maritime ordinances and regulations"â-
what is here meant ? it is that he (hall keep
the French marine regulations -which he does
not even know ? certainly not, it is his own
which he is supposed to understand.
That he will " deliver a lift of his crew
signed and confirmed by witnesses &c." to
whom is he to deliver this ? to the officers
of his own country where he is, certainly ;
it is not said he shall carry it with him, but on
the contrary expressed " that in each port
or harbour where he (hall enter with his ves
sel he shall (hew the present permifjion to the
officers authorised for this purpose." What is
1 this perm 'ijfien ? why the sea letter or pass
port that " thereby the property shall appear
really and truly to belong to one or other
of the parties," and to avoid vexation it is
provided he (hall not be obliged to (hew it
to any other than those " authorized for the
purpose." It has been observed by those
who endeavour to vindicate those afts of
violence and aggrefilon, that without these
particulars our vessels may, nay probably
will be manned by English sailors ! The trea
ty of 1778 being totally silent on that fub
je& has left to the United States the neces
sary power of determining on the rights and
adoption of citizens, and it is evident that
one of the expe&ed and contemplated ad
vantages resulting to France was, that by
our independence an asylum would offer in
time of war to British seamen, every one of
which employed on lÂ»oard our vessels is a
certain service rendered to her enemies,
therefore the more we have of them the
greater benefit to France.
That " he shall carry the colours, arms
and ensigns of the United States"âwant of
enfgn ha\ing only 13 flripes in
stead of 15) is said to have been afiigned in
one kftance as cause of condemnation !
What ! (hall Americans be tried in France .
by American laws ? and if Lhofe laws are
found infringed, fhstll they impose an arbi
trary penally, inflift a fine or enforce a for
feiture ?
From hence it is clear that it is not " from
any Inactivate tranllation." Thefuffering
"itrehuM has reason to complain of our gov
ernment. All nations heretofore guided by
some general and known rules in time of
war, have gradually agreed by tacit consent
and general practice on princifilei by which
property (hould be diftiiigUifhed, exppfed to
or protcfted from plunderâthus it is clear
ly undtrftood, " that when two powers are
at war they have a right to make prizes of
the (hips, good's and effe&sof each other up
on the high seas : whatever is the property
of the-enemy, may be acquired by capture
at fÂ«a> i'Jt the property of a friend cannot he
taken provided he olferves his neutrality"â
and by this plain and simple rule of right
and wrong did the United States expeil the
property of their citizens to be determined ;
it has not been so and it may become a ques
tion how to apply a remedy free from the
many evils inseparable from that state which
causes our reproaches and complaints, which
(hall be, the fubjeft of my next.
FRIEND TO LAWS & FREEDOM.
Phi/ad. 27th Nov. 1797.
Tie Senate, in a body, this day waited on
the President of the United States, with
the following answer to his address to both
Houses, at the opening of the present feJJion %
To the PRESIDENT of the United
States.
SIR,
THE communications you have thought
proper to make in your fpeecb to both hou
ses of Congress, on the opening of their
feflion, afford additional proofs of the atten
tion, integrity and firmnefs which have al
ways marked your official charaftcr.
We cannot but approve of the measures
you bad taken to ascertain the state and de
cline of the contagious licknefs which has
so lately afflicled the city of Philadelphia,
and the plealing cireumftance that Congress
is new affemblcd at that place, without ha
zard to the health of its members, evinces
the propriety of your having postponed a
determination to convene the National Le
giflaturc at any other placeâWe (hall take
into conlideratien the law of 1794 on this
subject, and will readily concur in any a
mendmeut which may be deemed expedient.
It would have given us much pleasure to
have received your congratulations oh the
re-establishment of peace in Europe and the
restoration of security to the person and pro
perty of our citizens from injtiftice by sea
But though these events so desirable to our
country and the world; have not taken place,
yet we have abundant cause of gratitude to
difpofer of human events for inte
rior tranquility and personal security, for
propitious feafonaâprofperous agriculture,
produftivefifheries andgeneral improvement,
and above all, for a rationalfpirit of civil and
religious libertâand a calm but steady de
termination to support our sovereignty a
gainst ail open and fccret attacks.
We learn with fatisfaftion that our En
voys Extraordinary to the French Republic
had fafely arrived in Europe, and were pro
ceeding to the scene of negociatiopâand
whatever may be the result of the million,
we are perfectly fatufied that nothing 011
your part has been omitted which could in
any way conduce to a fuccefsful conclusion
of the aegociation upon terms compatible
with the fafety, honour and interest of the
United States.âAnd we are fully convinc
ed that iu the mean time a manifeftation of
the unanimity and energy of which the peo
ple of the United States have given such
memorable "proofs, and a proper exertion of
those resources of national defence which wv
possess, will e&cntially contribute to the pre
servation of peace, and the attainment of
justice.
We think, fir, with you, that the com
merce of the United States, is effentialto the
growth, comfort and profperityofour coun
tryâand that the faith of society is pledged
for the preservation of the rights of aom
mercial and fea-faring, no less than of other
citixensâand even if our negociation with
P ranoe flfppli terminate favorably, and the
war iÂ» -Europe ccafe, yet the state t>f society
which unhappily prevails in so great a por
tion of the world, and the experience of past
times, under better circumstances, unite in
warning ns that a commorce so extensive,
and which holds out so many temptations
to lawless plunderers can never be fafe with
out protcftion and defenceâand We hold
ourselves obliged by every tie of duty which
binds us to our conllituents, to promote and
concur in such measures of marine defence
as may convince our aÂ»d seamen
that their rights are not facrificed, nor their
injuries forgotten.
We regret that notwithstanding the clear
and explicit terms of the Treaty between
the United States and his Catholic Majesty,
the Spanish garrisons are not yet withdrawn
from our Territory, nor the running ofthe
boundary line commenced. The United
States have been faithful in the performance
of their obligations to Spain, and had rea
son to expeft a compliance equally prompt
on the part as that power. Wi still how
ever indulge the hope, that the convincing
anfwere vifhich have been given to the ob
je&ions'ftated'by the Spani/h officers, to the
immediate execution of the Treaty will
haVe thteir proper effeft, and that this Trea
tv, so rrtutilaTfy beneficial to the contracting
partfes willbefnially observed withgoodfaith.
We thereforeentirely approve of your deter
mination to Continue in readiness to receive
the posts and to run the line of partition bet
ween our territory and that ofthe kingof Spain.
Attempts to alienate the affections of the
Indians, to form them into a confederacy,
and to excite them to aftual holtility against
| the United States, whetherrnade by foreign
agents or by others, are so injurious to our
intereftc at large, and so inlmman with ref
peÂ£l to our citizens inhabiting the adjacent
territory, as to deserve the most exemplary
punishment, and we will cheerfully afford
our aid in framing a law which may pres
cribe a punishment adequate to the commis
sion of crimes so heinous.
The several obje&s you have pointed out
to the attention of the Legislature, whether
ther they regard our internal or external re
lations (hall receive from us that attention
which they merit, and we will readily con
cur in all such measures as may be riecefTa
ry, either to enable us to fulfil our engage
ments at home, or to eaufe ourselves to be
refpe&ed abroad. And at this portentous
period, when the powers of Europe, with
whom we are connected by treaty or com
merce, are in so critical 'a situationâAnd
when the conduft of some of those powers
towards the United States, is so hostile and
menacing, the several branches of the gov
ernment are, in our opinion, called upon,
with peculiar importunity, to uniteâAnd
by union not only to devise and carry into
effeft those measures on which the fafety
and prosperity of our country depend, but
also to undeceive those nations who regard
ing us as a weak and divided people have
pursued fytlems of aggression iaconiiftent
with a state of peace betwesn independent
nations. And, Sir, we beg leave to assure
you, that we derive a singular consolation
from the refleftion, that at such a time the
Executive part of our government has been
â  committed to your hands. For your integ
rity, talents and firmnefs we place the most
antire confidence.
To which the Prefidcnt was pleased to make
the following reply :
Gentlemen of the Senate,
I THANIv you ff>r this Address.
When, after the most laborious investiga
tion, and fcrious refle&ion, without partial
considerations, or personal motives, meas
ures have been adopted or recommended, I
can receive no higher tcftimony of their rec
titude, thon the approbation of an Aflem
bly, so independent, patriotic and Enlight
ened, as the Senate of the United States.
Nothing has afforded me more entire fat
isfa&ion, than the coincidence of your judg
ment with mine, in the opinion of the es
sential importance of our Commerce, a n d
the absolute necessity of a maritime defence.
What is it, that has drawn to Europe the
fwperflaous riches of the three other quar
ters of the globe, but a Marine ? What is
it that has drained the wealth of Europe it-
I felf into the coffers of two or three of its
principal commercial powers, but a Marine ?
! The world has furnilhed no example of
' a flourifhing commerce, without a maritime
1 proteftion : and a moderate knowledge of
man and his history, will convince.auy one
that no such prodijy ever can arise. A
mercantile marine and a military marine mult
grow up together : one cannot long exist,
without the other.

The following letter giving an account of
the proceedings of the revolntionifts on the
other fide of the Rhine came to hand last
night.
Cologne, Sept. 7.
" It will be recollefted that about the
middle of the last century, the free imperial
city of Cologne was the scene of one of the
most awful revolutions. The discontented
burghers revolted against their magistrates,
and obtainedamomentary triumph by means
of violence and bloodshed; but they were
soon obliged to yield to the superior force
of the German empire. The three princi
pal chiefs of the rebellion were beheaded
by order of the emperor. The hotife of
Julich, the most active of the three chiefs
was demolilhsd, a pillar raised on the spot,
and A brass likeness of his head put at the
top thereof. The heads of his two compan
ions were put on poles, and these placed in
terrorem, at the top of two towers near the
Rhine, the one at the upper, and the other
at the lower end of the city.
"After a lapse ofimore thantwo hun
dred years, the partieular honors have this
day been paid to the memory of those three
individuals. The wardens of every church,
(there are above three hundred churches in
Cologne) were invited to cause all the bells
to be rung from 2 to 4 o'clock, and the en
signs of the city militia were dire&ed to dis
play their colours. When the ringing of
bells began, the troops quartered here, drew
up in parade. The rendezvous was at a
private house before which a tree of liberty
decorated with republican flags had been re
cently planted. The proceflion went to the
spot called to this day Julich's place. At
the head marched a battalion of grenadiers,
followed by the musical band of the French
ftaff; and a funeral car, upon which was
placed a red velvet culkion, and upon this
a laurel wreath, destined for the coronation
of Julich's bust. A body of troops, and
the clofed the proceflion. The
faking down of Julich's head cost much la
bour, and delayed the aft of coronation un
til half past five. The head was afterwards
carried off in triumph. But it was now too
late to haul down the other two heads, aa
it was at firft proposed.
There are several perfotis of consideration
at the head of the rcvolutionifts of Cologne.
Mr. De Kcmpis, a man of fomu talents and
considerable property, who has all along
been one of the leaders of the German Jaco
bins, is now president of the adminiftratiort
of Cologne. He was formerly a privy
councellor of his royal hignefs, the Eleftor
of Cologne. Profeffor Gerhard, Messrs. da
Krufft, de Remmel and several young jtirif

TORTONA, Sept. 5.
A body of Genoese troops have marched
into the Tuscan county of Pontremoli, and
formally taken pofTeffion of that territory in
the name of the Ligurian Republic. Pon
tremoli belonged formerly to the Genoese,
but was taken from them many years ago,
by Tufcany. A report was spread that an
engagement had already taken place between
the Genoese troops, and a Tuscan regiment
of horse sent from Florence to difpoflefs thÂ«
former, but this intelligence is at least pre
mature, and it is hardly probable that the
grand duke should rifle to employ force.
The Cifalpines are not in the least afraid of
a recommencement of hostilities between
France and the emperor; on the contrary
the appearance of a speedy reconciliation be
tween the French republicand Auttria fecma
to grieve many; because it thwarts their
great plan for a regeneration of Italy. They
lay, if the emperor refufes to fulfil the con
ditions of the preliminaries, the general in
chief Buonaparte will unquestionably no
longer fuffer the brother of Francis and his
minillers, to conspire in fecurityat Florence,
against the Republicans; we might then
deliver the patriots of Tufcany, and fend
the Grand duke back to Vienna. Â«
According to the plan of constitution
presented to the Genoese people, the Ligu
rian Republic have two councils; the one
composed of 60 the other of 120 members,
and a Dire&ory composed of 15 members ;
one third of the councils ard of the Direfto
ry go out every year. The 18 th article
fays, " It Â£the Ligurian Republic] pre
serves and transmits to posterity the senti
ments of gratitude to the French republic,
and declares itfelf the natural ally of all free
people." The pay of the members of the
legislature, is fixed at 10 livres a day, and
that of a Dire&or at 1000 livres per annum.
A citizen mull be 25 years old before he can
be elefted a member of the council 120
and he must have attained the age of 30
years before he can have a feat in the Coun
cil of 60, or be appointed a Diredor.
To the plan of the constitution is annex
ed a detailed account of the population of
the whole Genoese territory, according to
the crtifus of July ift. The number of in
habitants amounted then, to 53,0660. The
Republic is divided into fifteen diftri&s, de
riving their names from rivers, remarkable
mountains &c. Thecentrg diftriftcompris
es Genoa aÂ«d San-Pietro d'Arena. Genoa
alone contained at the epoch of the lateeen
fus, 8j,86i inhabitants. The 34 imperial
fiefs, which contain 106 pariihes, and above
100,000 inhabitants have, since that time
been united with the Ligurian Republic
under the name of " the Ligurian Alps,"
lo that the whole population mud now a
mount to about 650,000 fouls. After all,
there is little probability that the Ligurian
Republic will remain a diftinft slate. Citi
zen Ruggiero has been sent to Milan, to
consult with the Dire&ory of the Cisalpine
Republic, upon the most effectual means to
rcftore to Italy its prilUae glory ?md prospe
rity, and it is believed that on his return the
union with the Cisalpine Republic will be
proposed to the Ligurian people.

Will he return ? God grant it'.
The proofs of all the plots cis the Interior and
Exterior are now about being brought to light.
A British agent has been arrested at Calais. Â°l-)e
was the bearer of the most important corres

light on the extent of, and the aflors in, the
conspiracy. In these, Lord Malmelbury, sent
to us by the iufamius Pitt, is completely un
malked. War,eternal warto litt and his gov

ahd above all, attention to the Courts of Naples
and Turin I Journal des llommes Librcs*
Relative to the hopes of Peace, the following
observations a> e made by the Journaldes Ccwi
pagnes et des Arnieesâ
" Frenchmen ! never forget that it is Britain
alone which diredta the continental powers in
their wars against you. Ilow can vou imagine
that Austria will make a separate peace ? Are
you ignorant of that power being always openly
or secretly in the pay of Great-Britain ? Are
you ignorant that the Emperor, his miniflry,
and all his court, are fade led, bridled, mounted
and whipped alone by Pitt ? What is the wiih
ot the British government ? To keep theFrcnch
from their island. They urgt the Austrian
hordes againit us ; they pour emigrants and
priests on ourcoaftsj they murder the poor ca
tholics in Ireland, because they are patriots and
revolutionilts ; and they inundate us with re
frailory pricfls.beeau'e they are counter-rcvo
luticnifts arid royalifis. Frenchmen ! make a
last effort to avenge humanity j displace Mr.
Pitt, and realize the hopes of Europe, so long

coalition is in London; our enemies are there
difpeife them, and found the Irith, the Scottilh
and the Engiiftj republics, while our armies of
the north eltabhfh the Rhine Germanic republic.
Let peace with every refrailory government be
made in Buonaparte's manner.
The anniversary of the foundation of the
Republic wasselebrated on the ill Vendemair'e,
(21ft September) with much pomp. "The
tete of the Republic," fays one of the journals,
" was very brilliant and celebrated in a manner
worthy of its objedi. ' The concourfc of pto.
pie was immense, the cry oflong live the repi ' ~
Ar civic fnnjrs, the tn live'y effufi.ins of py,

the price of the libetty that they have acquired,
and of which they are now determined not tn
be again robbed." ' ,
PARIS, Sept. 29â¢
Wc are, aflured that Buonaparte has written
to Count Potockie, ci-devant ambafT.'dor of Po
land to Conflantinoplt, to reqjeft the Marlhils
of the D'ft of 179 r, to render themselves at Mi
lan, with the Utmtft speed , and likewise the
principal members of that diet. Even befori*
this letter of Gen. Buonaparte's, a rwmber of
Poles who took principal partÂ» in theinfurreiftion

Such is the fact. The quiflions which arise
cut of it are these.
It it alked in what light the powers who have
divided Poland will look upon this flocking of
the Poles to Buonaparte ; and what part Francs
will take therein Whether any question arose
concerning Poland in the conference at Monte

this biifinef- ? and whether P?',,! ift, who,in the
beginning of lvs reign, seated a number of
Poles with great tenderness, has not thereby

CONGRESS.
HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, November 27.
Mr. Bartlett, from MafTachufetts (in
the place of Mr. Bradbury who resigned)
appeared, and took his oath, and feat.
The following members appeared to day
for the firft time, viz. Meflrs. Parker and
Nicholas from Virginia, Mr. Blount, from
North Carolina, Mr. Dennis, from Mary
land, Mr. Brookes, from- New-York, and
Mr. Sewall, from Maflachufetts.
Mr. Dwight Foster, from the com
mittee of claims, presented a report, which
stated that the committee having examined
the files and journals of the second session
of the fourth congress, found sundry peti
tions.and memorials referred to the commit
tee of claims, which, for want of time, had
not been reported upon ; and that some of
the petitioners being now attending to leatn
the ifTue of their applications, they propo
sed a resolution for the adoptionof the house
to the following effeft :
" Resolved, that all claims which, during
the~ second session of the fourth congress re
ferred to the committee of claims, and not
by them reported upon, be and the fame are
hereby referred to the committee of claims,
to be by them reported upon agreesbly to
the rules of the house."âAgreed.
The Speaker observed, that there had
been an order made last week contrary to the
rules of the house, by committing a bill to
a committee of the whtAe, which had orig
inated in a former session, without introdu
cing it ii) the way dire&ed by the rules. It"
would be necefTary, therefore, to discharge
the committee from tffe committal.
Mr.LiviHGSTOn accordingly moved that
the comnriittee of the whole to whom was re
ferred the bill relative to refugees from Can
ada and Nova Scotia, be dilchargcd from
the consideration.âAgreed.
Mr. Williams then moved that a com
mittee be appointed to prepare and bring in
a bill for that purpose.âAgreed, and a com
mittee of three appointed.
Mr. W. Claiborne presented a petition
fronr Stephen Cantrell, of the state of Ten
neflee, praying for compenfatiwn for milita
ry service, rendered to the United States,
in an expedition against the Cherokee In
dians in the year 1795âReferred to the Se
cretaty of War.
Mr. Harper moved, that as the printed
papers relative to the claims of Henry Hill,
had only been laid upon their table this
morning, and as they were of some impor
tance, that the fubjeft (made the order for
to-day) should be postponed till Wednesday.
Mr. Williams said there was no occa
fron for this motion, as if the fubjeA was
not calVdup, it would lie .over of course.
Mr. Dwight Foster moved that the
report of the committee of claims on the pe
tition of Samuel Abbott, and others, be re
ferred to a committee of the whole to-mor
row.âAgrefcd.
Mr. Livingston observed, at thebegin
ning of the firft session of last congress, a
committee wss appointed to prepare and re
port {landing rules for the regulation of the
house. He moved thatfuch a committee be
now appointed.
Mr. Harper thought, on consideration,
the gentlemau would find this motion to be
unnecefiary. They had been in the habit,
it was true, of heretofore appointing a com
mittee to report a new set of rules ; but he
believed itVould be allowed that the ufeful
nefs of rules depended in some degree upon
their permanency. He thought they were
changed too often, without good reason,
which produeed an uncertainty in the con
dufting of business. He saw no inconve
nience which would attend the adoption of
the present rules; he thoughtthem fuffieient;
and if any gentleman wished to introduce
any new rule, or to change an old one, he
might do it, by way of motion.
Mr. Livingston said the usual courlc
was to appoint a committee to report a set
of rules ; and in the mean time, the old ones
were declared binding. With refpeft to the
present rules,he had difcoveredfeveral incon
veniences. He would mention one, which
was that requiring all bills to be introduced
in the fame way, though they had undergÂ®nc
discussion at a former session, the inconve
nience of which had just been seen, and
which he thought a dilatory practice. ihe
idea of the gentleman from S. Carolina that
they ought not to change their rules, hedid
not think deserved all the weight which, he
gave it. Every house, by the constitution,
to be the judge of its own rules, and
tiie adopting; of those of.a former house was |
merely a temporary expedient. If the house, i
however, should not think proper to go into
a revision of the old rules, he should move
such alterations in them as appeared to him
necefiary. !
Mr. Harped replied, if the inconveni
ence which had been mentioned had exist
ence, it might be removed by a particular
motion ; but he was doubtkil whether the
thing complained of was an inconvenience.
He believed they were seldom too flow in
passing laws ; the contrary was more fre
quently the cafe. The more formalities
required, and the greater number of afpedts
in which a law was seen, the more likely it
would be to be good. If a gentleman
wifhirig to introduce a bill, had drawn it up
well; he would have no difficulty in perfuad-1
ing a committee to report it ; if not it was
better that it should be amended before its
iutroduftion. He believed, therefore, that â¢
they had better go on in their usual way,
and avoid innovation.
Mr. Gallatin said, as this motion was
in conformity to the ccmftant praftice of the
house, he could not fee with what proprie
ty it could be called an innovation.
Mr. SiTGRF.AVF.s believed the rules of
the lafl house were already the rules of this,
by a resolution of last feflion.
The motion was put and negatived 37
to 32.
Mr. W: lliams said, it was generally al
lowed that the present militia laws were not
only very expensive in their execution, but
very inadequate in their effefts. The fub
jeft had before been under consideration ;
but, for want of time, was faffed over. He
tbereforepropofeda resolution to the follow
ing effedfc :
" Resolved that a committee be appoint
ed to report whether any and what emend- ;
menu are necefiary to the aft providing an 1
uniform militia system throughout the Unit- \
ed States."âAgreed and a committee of
five appointed.
Mr. Otis, frofiff the committe appointed
to draft an address in answer to the speech
of the President of the United States, re
ported the following, which was twice read,
and referied to a committee of the whole for
to-morrow :
SIR,
WHILE our sympathy is excited by the
recent fufferings of the citizens of Philadel
phia, we participate in the fatisfa&ion which
yon arc plcafed to express, that the dura
tion Â«.f the late calamity was so limited as to
render unnecefTary the expense and inconve
nience that would have been incident to the
convention of Congress in another place :
And we shall readily attend to every ufeful
amendment of the law which contemplates
the event of contagious sickness at the feat
of government.
In lamenting the increase of the injuries
offered to the persons and property of our
citizens at sea, we gratefully acknowledge
the continuance of interior tranquillity, and
the attendant blessings of which you remind
us, as alleviations of these fatal effe&s of in
justice and violence.
Whatever may be the result of the mission
to the French republic, year early and uni
form attachment to the interests of our
country âyour important services in the
struggle for its independenceâand your un
ceasing exertions for its welfareâafford no
room to doubt of the sincerity of your ef
forts to condudt the negociation to a fuc
cefsful conclusion, on -such terms as may be
compatible with the fafety, honour and in
ter?!! of the United State*. We have also
a firm reliance upon the energy and una
nimity of the people of these States, in the
assertion of their rights, and ia the determi
nation to exert, upon all proper occasions,
their ample refourees in providing for the
national defence.
The importance of commerce, and its be
neficial influence upon agriculture, arts, and
manufactures, have been verified in the
growth and profjÂ«.'r(ty of our country. It
is efTcntially connefted with the other great
interests of the community. They must
flourifh and decline together ; and while the
extension of our navigation and trade, natu
rally excites the jealousy, aud tempts the a
varice of other nations, we are firmly per
suaded, that the numerous and deserving
class of citizens engaged in these pursuits,
and dependent on them for their subsistence,
has a strong and indifpuUble claim to our
support and protf&ion.
The delay of the Spanish officers to ful
fil the treaty eliding with his catholic ma
jesty, is a source of deep regret âWe learn,
however, with fatisfaftion, that you still in
dulge hopes of removing the obje&ions
which have been made to its execution, and
that you have continued in readiness to re
ceive the posts. Disposed to perfotm with
fidelity, our national engagements, we shall
insist upon the fame justice from others,
which we exercise towards them.
Our abhorrence cannot be too strongly
exprefTed, of the intrigues of foreign agents,
to alienate the affeftions of the Indian na
tions, and to rouse them, to a&s of hostility
again ft the United States. No means in
our power, shall be omitted, of providing
for the suppression of such cruel pra&ices,
and for the adequate punishment of their a
trocious authors.
Upon the other interesting futjedis notic
ed in your address, we shall bestow the re
quisite attention. To preserve inviolate the
public faith, by providing for the due exe
cution of our treaties; to indemnify those
who may have just claims to retribution
upon the United States, for expencesincurr
ed in defending the property, and>relieving
the necessities of our unfortunate fellow-ci
tizens; to guard against the laws intended
to secure advantages to the navigation of
our own vessels ; and especially, to prevent,
by all possible means, an unnecefTary accu
mulation of the public debt, are duties
which we shall endeavour to keep in view,
and discharge with afiidnity.
We with great, anxiety, the lin
gular and portentous iituationof the princi
pal powers of Europe. It was devoutly to
be wiflied, that the United States, remote
from the seat-os war am! difeordj unambi
tious of conqntft ; re?fpe&ing the fights of
other nations; and desirous, merely, to a
vail themfelvcs of their natural refonrces,
might be permitted tÂ» brhold the feertes
which desolate that quarter of the globe,
with only those sympathetic ertiotions which
arc natural tothclovers of Jieact, & friends of
thehuman race. But we are led by events to
associate with these feelings a sense of the
dangers which menace our. security and
peace. We rely upon the aflurances of a
zealoiu and hearty concurrence in such mea
sures as may be necefTary to avert these dan
gers; and nothing (m our part (hall be want
ing to repel them which the honour fafety
and prosperity of our \pqimtry: rtiay require.
Mr. Harper fÂ«idÂ»->ithat in pursuance of
the notice which he hari given,- he now rose
to move a refoltition to the following effeÂ£t:
" Resolved, that a committee be appoint
ed to prepare and'report a bill providing an
uniform system of bankruptcy throughout
the United Staces."
Mr. H. added that it was unnecefiary, he
supposed, to enlarge upon the uftftilnefs of i
such a law. That the passing of it would !
be attended witjj difficulties, he was ready '
to allow ; but as these could only be pro
perly judged of when the bill was reported,
he trusted no objs&ion would be made to
the appointment of the proposed commit-I
tee.
Mr. Co it would have no objection to a- i
greeing to the resolution, if the mover would
consent to a small alteration in its form.
He himfelf was not convinced that such a j
law would be of public advantage He ;
wished, therefore, that the committee should ;
be appointed "to enquiry whether such a
law be expedient."
Mr. Harper said, if it was the intention
of the gentleman to transfer the power of!
judging of the expediency'of the measure i
from the House to a f<?leÂ£t committe, he j
should certainly objeft to it. He believed
the resolution would be best in its present
form.
Mr. Livingston said there were two
courses to be taken in the introduftion of
bills. The gentleman from South Carolina
had chosen that which diredted the appoint
ment of a committee to report a bill. He
might have adopted the mode proposed by
the gentleman from Conne&icut ; but there
could be no qnfiftion as to the propriety of
the present motion.
Mr. Baldwin observed that the way in
which the gentleman from Connefticut
might obtain his end would be by moving to
commit the motion.
Mr. Coit accordingly moved that the
motion be committed.
Mr. Baldwin added, that the objeftions
to t*his mode of proceeding, which might
be urged in ordinary cases, were not appli
cable in this, because the committee ap
pointed would fee the several solemn deci
sions which had heretofore been had on this
fubjeft, and would calculate whether it
would be worth their wlvrl# to go over the
Dune ground which had heretofore been
trodden with so little success. If be recol
lected right, the late Cblleague of tht pre
sent mover in the business, introduced the
measure in the firft feflion of Congress under
the present government; but it was attend
ed with so many difficulties, th/M the gen
tleman himfelf was discouraged from procee
ding with it. Almost every Congress fmce
had the fnbjeft before them. He believed
he had not less than five or fix bills which
had gone out the fame course. Our conn
try, he said, was so extensive, and our in
terests so various, that no system of bank
ruptcy, he believed, could be formed to suit
all its parts. If, indeed, the eommittee,
after revising the several bills heretofore re
jected, could fuggett any new provisions
which might appear to obviate former ob
jedtions ; or if there (hould appear to them
to be any new circumstances in the present
situation of the country, which (hould even
call for the law with its former deficienc.es,
they will of course report a bill. If the
contrary (hould be the course, they will re
port it as their opinion.
The motion was agreed to, and a com
mittee of five was appointed, viz. Messrs.
Harper, Coit, Nicholas, Sitgreaves and
Baldwin, u â 
Mr. Rutledge presented the petition of
Ann Gray, an aged widow, who had loft
her huiband and fan in the revolutionary
war, prsying for relief. Referred to the
Committee of Claims. Adjourned.

NEW YORK, Nov. 27.
A report circulates freely iÂ« the city, that
a vcffel in a (hort pafTage from Hamburg,
going into the harbaur of Boflon, has been
(poke with by a captain of a veflel arrived at
this port, from the Bay of Chaleur,. who
learned from the Hamburg captain tbat the
emperor os-Russia had engaged to fnrnifh
180,000 men to the emperor <Â»f Germany.
We give it as a mere report, which this days
mail nmft confirm or eontradfft.
In the accounts frsm the Upper Rhine
.of the 12th of September, we observe that
the circle of Suabia, as well as the eleftor of
. Franconia and the upper Rhine had applied
. i to the emperor of Russia for bis mediation in
the approaching peace to be n-egociated for
. ; the Empire : and that the elector of Mentz
; had proposed that the whole empire (hould
, 1 apply to him for his co-operation to main
â  tain the integrity of the empire, and to pro
â  cure a Constitutional Peace.
Tallien is mentioned in the French paperi
i : as being dangerously ill of a malignant fever,
: i Noel, the French minister in Holland ii
, > said to have been recalled. His " conftitM.
tion," we certainly know ; did not fuil
1 1 with the climate of that country. Charity
for his feelings may have therefore di&atec
â  this recall.
The defertien of the troops fiom the ar
. ' my of the Sambre and Meufe is dated undei
, 1 Paris dates of 23d Sept. to have been vÂ« n
confideraWe. The inspector general of the' j
p.rmy of the North had been called ifrom )
Holland to put a flop to that mifchief. t
