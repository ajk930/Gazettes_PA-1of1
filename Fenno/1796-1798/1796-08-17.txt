LONDON, June 9. Â£
Wc are now enabled to Hate some particulars re- ta
fpedling the disagreeable news from India. We in
are not yet in poff-flion of the detaiJ, although we
hive received the Madras Gazettes down to the 9th p
of January-lad, which probably may be precluded
fruiTJ ptrbJt+Hing 6n y fucb (je'ves.
According to private letters received from a jjen- B
tleman high in the company's service in India, we
learn, that the 25th battalion of Sjjpoys, com
minded by Capt. Grant, having been ordered to },;
Batavia, the troops refufed ta embark ; on which oi
the governor-general and council ordered this corps
to be disbanded. The troops refufed to deliver up tr
their arms; the 29th battalion ot Sepoys was or- ct
dered againll them, and at length filed on them, m
by which several men were killed. ' m
Some days after, four other battalions of native if
troops were ordered to Ganjam, on the coast, bat R
refufed to proceed., until the 2QÂ»h battalion was pu
â  ifhed for having firad on theircompanions. The ; r
native troops remained in this Hate of mutiny when j 0
the latest accounts left Bengal; audit is even re- p
ported, thA the governor had ordered all the 1
Jlery from Dum-Dum (not far diflant from Calcut v '
ta, and where a great quantity of ordnance isuus- al
ally kept) into the fort ef Calcutta, as a place of al
fafety. But we cannot vouch for the tiuth of this vÂ»
latter intelligence. 31
Private advices from India also mention, that 6
feveral^of the Brilifli officeâ¢ of 'he company's efta
blifhment wete in a Hate of mutiny ; that an offi
cer of high rank a&s as their president,. and that 4
they have a regular chain of corrcfpondence "
throughout India. We (hall be very happy to be
tocontradidl these rumors, which are truly
alarming, but there is some confutation in know
ing," that the (hip which earned out the regulati a
onsot our government, for placing 'he company's n
officers on the fame footing as the king's, was seen
going up the Bengal tiver, as the Major Pinckney
(American (hip) was coming away. n

The funds, on account of the supposed termina- c.
tton 01 the armistice on the Rhine, of which we I
entertain no doubt, continue to fuffer a daily de
prcllion. Some'bargains were yesterday done at j
one time so low as 60 for the consols in July ; and
the India (lock fell to 195, some odds. .

Ihe Insurgents, by the of Sir Gilbert i

I he rumors of an engagement on the Rhine, in
which the Auflrinns are said to Inve been defeated,
have greatly contributed to affecl the interest of the
(tockholdejs ; but there is no authority for the de
feat which had been so indurtrionfly circulated ;
and we hope, that the next news conti
