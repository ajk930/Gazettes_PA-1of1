CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Thursday, April I*.
.V/j R - RtEC> prefeated two petitions (one
iVX from the inhabitants of Bridgwater, and
the other from the inhabitants of Abingdon,
in the Hate ofMalfachufetts) against the arm
ing of merchant's vessels, and praying that e
very means in the powiÂ»r of government may
be taken to prevent a war.âReferred to the
committee of the whole on the state of the
union.
Mr. Coit called up for conCderation, the
resolution which he had laid upon the tabli;
ago, on the fubjedt of the naturali
zation law ; which being read, it was made to
run in the usual form, viz. that the committee,
dice, be directed to enquire and report whe
ther any and what alterations are necefTary in
the ait, &c.
Mr. Sit,g rsaves wished the committee
to have the whole fabjeft before them, in or
der that they might report a new system re
specting naturalization of foreigners, if they
fliould think it neceirary. He thought our
present situation called for regulations on this
j head ; since, at a time when we may very
fliortly be involved in war, there are an im
mense number of French citizens in ou?coun
try. He could not fay what might be the
proper measures to be tak*n with refpeft to
thel'e persons ; they should be fitch asthe in
terest of the country requires ; these might be
to place them under certain regulations,or by
fending them out of the country. He moved
to add to the resolution, therefore, the follow
ing words, viz, " and furtherJ* caÂ»fiiter and
report upon the expediency of ejtaili/bitig by ,'ttv,
regulations rejpcÃing aliens arriving or rejiding
'within the United States."
Some conversation took place, as to the
propriety of letting this resolution lie for the
preient, on account of some conftitutionalob
jeiifions j but Mr. Da vis, of Kentucky, sta
ting the ne'cedity of some regulation of this
kind, from a fadi within his own knowledge
of a Frenchman refidirg in that state, who
some time ago had ilTued a number of com
millions for a certain expedition, which com
mifiions are yet in existence, Â»nd that this per
son Constantly employs himfelf in alienating
the affections of the people of that state from
their government, the resolution was immedi
ately and unanimously adopted.
The House then again resolved itfelf into a
committee of the whole on the state of the
union, Mr. Dent in the chair, on the bill to
provide an additional armament for the further
protection of the trade of the United States,
and for other purpofesj when ths considera
tion of the motion of Mr. Nicholas for (hik
ing out the fourth fectioil, being resumed,
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) said, that the
fourth feirtion of the bill had never met his
approbation, and therefore, altho' the motion
syr ftrlking it out had been made by the gen- :
tleman from Virginia, and advocated upon
principles v.ry different from those which
influenced his mind, he should neverthelel'a
vote with him for expunging it. He repeat
qd, What he had yesterday intimated, that if
it were paflible for that member and himfelf
to fettle the question by compromise, he would
readily agree to give tip the fourth, fifrh,
sixth and seventh sections, which alone con
tained the word convoy, so offenlive to that
gentleman, and against which he had display
ed all his resentment, provided the other four
could be retained. As however the matter
could not be fettled by compo(itio<i between
them in this way, Mr. Dayton thought it his
duty to state his objections against the
011, left, in voting with the mover to expunge
it, it might be ftippofed that he acquiesced in
his doctrines and reasoning, than which no
thing could be more adverse to his feelings.
To him it had always appeared, that when
the circumftahces of the country, or the ge
neral ftateof'things, required any addition to
their armed force, whether by land or sea, it
became the duty of Congress to eftablifli and
provide for it, but that here their powers
ceased, and that they were stepping beyond l
their proper province when they went so far
(as in the section in question), as to declare
njjho fha4l be authorized and empowered to
smploy and direst such force, and more es
pecially the Manner in which it shall be em
ployed. This the constitution had already
decided, by committing to the President of
the United States the command of the army
and navy, to be directed and employed' by
him as should seem best, cpnliftently with
the state in which we might happens to
be ; if in peace, confififtently with a state
of peace, and if in wai, in furtherance of
the object of it. He would not be under
stood as insinuating that the right of declar
ing war was not vested exclusively in Congress;
but that whether--the declaration (hotild be
made, or refufed to be made, the military and
naval force was not the less under the direc
tioh of the President, to be used as should ap
pear to be mofl likely to promote the general
welfare, having regard to the existing state of
things, whether of peace or war. That the
commander in chief polTelTed the constitution
al power of employing these armed vessels as
convoys in time of peace, he himfelf had no
doubt, for he did not fee any diftinftion in
principle between employing a naval force to
protect our merchantmen in the prosecution
of a fair and lawful trade, or in enforcing the
observance of the law of nations, and employ
ing the military in enforcing the execution of
the municipal taw. It was therefore nugato
ry to enaft, in the words of the feftion, "that
the President of the United States be autho
rized andempowed to employ the armed ves
sels as convoys, or in any other manner for
the purposes of defence," since he already
poffefTed that power and authority, derived
t too from ahigher source, the people atid tbecon
ftitution. It might indeed be vorfe thaYi nu
gatory, it might be of dangerous precedent,
and confitkred as carrying*a strong implica
tion that without this law he could have no
such authority, and very naturally too, for
why else should it bccopie the subject of le
grflation. If an aCt of Congress was necessary
m this instance, ai tire feftion certainly im
plied, then Mr. Dayton said, they mull go
further, and authorize the President by law
alio to employ the land forces in covering ef
cortsof provision and clothing thro' the Indi
an country to some of our advanced posts,
which could not be approached without paf
â¢fing thi'o' linllan territory, or to employ our
armed veCTils in con voyiogf applies across the
l.ikesto other polls; for, ill the navigation of
thele, as of the ocean, we had not tht exclu- j

five right, but other powws participated.
Upon thefe occalions, had thisnev*
doctrine been broached, and yet in principle,
they were certainly analogous, for in both
cases, but especially the latter, ho/t.ifrtres j
â might enftie upon the armed fi.fce protecting
â what was under it's charge, and war might be I
the consequence. Convinced as he was that
the feciion could convey not a tittle ofjiower
to the President,- but that, if adopted, it
might be thought to establish a principle, the
extent and effects of which could not but be
injurious, he trusted that it would be reject
ed. If this fliould be the cafe, and gei\tle
men were rather disposed to retain, t'hxn to
flrike out the succeeding three, merely that
they might serve as regulations for any con
voys which the President should gr/.nt, lie
Ihould take the liberty of moving to amend
the; sth fettion by perfixing to it the follow
ing, viz. And be it enadted, &c. that if the
President of the United States should tliink.
proper to direCt all or any part of the naval
fo|rce herein before provided to ierve as con
voys, the following rules, regulation* and re
ftriitions be observed, viz." W'Tth this a
tnendment, the three lucceedifigfedtions would
very properly be incorporated, and become
one, because they were regulatory merely in
cafe of convoys being granted, and not direc
tory as to the granting of them", whtctMhotild
be discretionary with the Prefidentalofle.
Mr. Gallatin said, the gentleman from
New-Jersey had taken this day, the fame
ground which he took yesterday on this sub
ject, viz. that the feition ought to be struck
out, because the constitution has already pla
ced the power in the hands of the President of
the United States of applying and employing,
afly Naval force which Olgy.V railed
-in such marmmrrt"iffTTTTTfif s~ftT, <ac<*Â»Wl4iTg to
the state in which the country may at the time.
Mr. G. did not think this principle was re
cognized by our laws. In the law for coiii
pletirig, manning, and equipping for sea the
three frigates;, it is said, the Prefidentjball have
poiuerto employ thefrigatesâan ex prelfi on Which
could not have been made use of, had it been
supposed that the President had a right to em
ploy them in any manner whatever, by power
derived from the Constitution. He believed
this opinion of the gentleman from New-Jer
sey, arcife from confoundingtwodiftinCt Ideas,
viz. the coriftitittional powefof the President,
as Commander iri Chief to command, and the
legislative application of any force which may
be raised by the United States. There is,
an essential diftinftioti between the
power to command, and the application of a
force. To command is certainly subordinate
to applying the force. The President of the
United States is Commander in Chief of the
Militia of the United States; but wiiCnthat
Militia is raised, it is to be applied in a man
ner fpecifically direfted by law. It is true,
that within our own territory, it js in the pow
er of the President to grant escorts, or con
voys, for the exportation of any provisions
from one part of thÂ« United StdfeS to ano
ther. But these convoys are as a different na
ture from convoys Â»t sea. The reason is Ob
vious. The onois within our own t;rritory
wherein we have exclusive jurifdi&ioh, where
no interruption can take place, except from
an invading enemy; but over the sea, we have
no such jurildiction. The sea is common
property, being so, we haVe rights at sea;
but other Nations have also rights these, and
our vessels meet there armed and unarmed
vessels, fame rights involved in which have
given rife to questions of the most delicate na
ture. \
Besides, if this power of granting convoys'
in the Preftdent be taken for granted, and that
he has aright to grant convoys under our pre
sent cii"cumftauceÂ», a diltimHion mud be af
fuined, which is not recognized in the Con
stitution, viz. betwixt the power of making'
War, and the power of committing hostility.
Because it neceflarily results from the power
of granting Convoys, that the Pvefidenr Has
also the power of authorizing the commiflion
of hoftili'ties. Convoys are granted for the
protedtien, by force, -of our trade, anti any
attack is hostility; and until the diftmdtion
which he had mentioned was alfiimed, it was
impossible to allow that the President had any
such power.
The committee had been fold that the right
of granting convoys* is a right which belongs
to Neutral Nations ; and the gentleman from
S. Carolina has given the fame right which
exists in the Kings of Sweden and Denmark
to employ convoys, to the President of the
United States. Supposing the premifesto be
true, all that could be concluded from those
examples, was th&t the sovereignty of a neti
tral nation had a right to grant convoys ; and
therefore that Congress, and not the President,
had that right here.
The question of granting convoys, is one
of the most delicate nature that could Come
before Congress. The motion made yester
day, was made with a view of deciding that
question. The gentleman from New-Jersey
taking it for granted, the power of gran
ting convoys refide's in the President, is defi
l'ous also of ftrikitlg out this fettion. If this
feClion was struck out, then the motion would
return 011 the sth feftion, which he hoped
would be struck out, and fupefcede the a
mendment which the gentleman from New-
Jersey said it was his intention to make., As
there seemed to be a pretty general consent
to strike Out the 4th section, he would not
detain the committee any lohger at present;
his only objeft in rising wasto fay that he dif
fered altogether in opinion from the gentle
man from New-Jersey as to the power of the
'President in relation to convoys.
Mr. Sew a l l said, it could not be expec
ted that these parts of the country which
principally depended upon commerce, would
readily consent to the abandonment of com
merce altogether ; but whatever tlie intenti
ons of gentlemen were, their arguments went
that length. It is true, that when we shall
I enjoy a-ftate of peace, and commerce shall
want 110 attention, the gentleman from Vir
ginia proposes to attend to it. He did not be
lieve, that Congress would con
sent thus toadl towards their commercial citi
zens.
As to the right of the President to employ
Convoys, he would make some observations
on that point. By the Constitution, he is
made the Commander in Chief of the Army
and Navy, of the United States. Congress
had seldom had Naval fubjedts before them;
but with respect to the army, he believed no
instance had ever occurred in which the Pre
sident had been directed tn employ, or re
stricted from employing, the armed force in
any particular manner.
The gentleman laftup had applied himfclf
to the act respecting the frigates. He al' jw
ed that that act (ays the frigates (hall be man
ned and employed. But it did.not lav liow.
j By directing be employed it waiihewn
,i tfiat Ahey were not intended to be (lationed
vvitlVn the United States. Ihe word
perhaps, be unneceflary. But it was at that
time attempted to i'nfert a clanfe in the act
whifh fliould have obliged the President to
confine the employment as the velTels within
the jurildiction of the iJnited States. This
tailed ; "but did the gentleman from Penn
sylvania then doubt that the President had,
the powerof employing the frigates when and
where he pleated f He befieved he did not.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania admits
that the Piiefident, from'being commander in
chief, has a right to grant convoys; but h e
fays they are to be confined to our own terri
tory. So that no regard is to be had to our
commercial citizens or to. the commerce of
the United States. Our citizens going with
out the territory of the United States are to be
no longer objeits of our attention ; ourveflels,
though they carry with them papers mewing
them to be the mips of the United States, it
was :o be underload that no protection could
be afforded to them as such ; being once at a
certain distance from the United States, our
citizerts were tp be abandoned to the elements,
or to the hostility of mankind, wherever they
went. If this was the intention of govern
ment, that when the citizens of the United
States go abroad, they are to be out of the
protection of government, and that they are
to be attended to only within the lines of our
own jurifdiiiion, this fliould be thoroughly
. and perfectly understood, that protection
might be fought elsewhere-
Ms. t)ay tom said, that he wifhrdtobriiig
to the remembrance of the member from
P<nnfylvania and of the committee, a feftion
very fmiilar to this contained in a bill "for
providing a naval force," which was sent from
the Senate to the House during the lalt fedion.
It would be recollected, that he had then
j moved to rtrike it cut, for the very reasons
which.he now fuggelted against the feftion
under ccnfideration, and they were very gene-
J rally acquiesced iri, and the motion carried by
a large majority. It was true that the Senate
did not at firft accede to the amendment, but
upon a conference being had, in which the
principles that influenced the amendment
were explained, they receded, and the feftion
; was rejected. He here read the section
j from the till as it originally came from
, the Senate, expressly " authorizing the Pre
sident to employ the naval force "in such man
' ner as the general interests might require,"
and repeated the aflertion that it wasa power
â  which Congress could neither give nor take
j away, and they had on the former occasion
alluded to, so considered and decided it. As
to th? word " employed," which the gentle
man had discovered in the act that was palled,
and on which he placed some reliance as fup
i porting his doftrine, it could only be confi
i dered as direfting more fully their complete
equipment for fervige, and that the mips
mould be be put in commiflion forfos.in Con
tradiftinftion to their being laid up in ordinary.
But it was observable too that the general
term only ufed, and that no expreHion was
found in the law prescribing.as was contended
for in the present instance, the particular man
ner and fervid in which they mould be em
ployed.
Mr. Nicholas said it appeared strange,
that, when gefitleinen were agreed as to the
thing to be done, they fliould disagree so
widely in tlteir reasons for doing it. The
words wiiich the gentleman from New-Jersey
had stated to be Itftlck out in the frigate bill,
were (truck out because they were ablurd and
unneceflary, because nobody denied that the
President had the power of employing vessels
. within our own jurisdiCtion { but he would
tell the gentleman tyhat was the intention of
inferring the clanfe foi' re ft fitting their use.
It was to prevent the operation of a sentiment
, which gave to the President all power, and
this qneltion was fihally negatived by one vote
only, fironi motives of accommodation.
That commerce may be protected in a time
of peace, nobody denied j but except such
proteftion was authorized by Congress, and
the peace of this country was loft by the mea
sure, the President would be j ufily chargable
with having 101 l it. Mr. N. asked if there
were no intervening afts between a flaw of
peaceand a stale of war ? And that if the Pre
sident had the power to do afts, the etrent of
which mud be war, he had not the power of
making war? This power, he inlilted, was
ncluded in the right to grant convoys; for
except learclies were to be refilled, the convoy
would be of 110 use ; and it they were to be
refilled, war mull be the consequence.
Mr, N. said he was not surprized at the
doftrine of the gentlemant from New-Jersey,
as it was in perfect jconformitv to that which
he held the other day with refpett to the mi
litary eftabliftiment. Because the gentleman
from Pennsylvania then gave his opinion as
to the force of the country, the gentleman
from New-Jersey charged him with arrogating
tofiimfelf the command of the army. So that
of the President were so to employ the mili
tary force as to leave adiltrift cf the country
wholly naked and unprotected, the legislature
were not to enquire into the fitfficiency of
the force of the country, because that
gentleman would tell them they were arroga
ting the command of the army. For his own
part, he never did fee a cafe in which it was
more necelfary for the legislature to aft than
the present, nor where, if they did not aft,
more responsibility would be thrown upon the
President.
The qtteftion was put, and carried without
a division, for striking out the 4-tli feftio;i.
After the question was carried for striking
out the 4th. fettion, Mr. Dayton role to
move the promised amendment to the jth
feftion, bv introducing immediately after the
words " Be it enafted, See." the following,
viz. " That if the President of the United
States mould think proper to employ any part
of the naval force hereinbefore directed, as
convoys, the follow ing rules, regulation and
reltriCtions be observed, viz." Arc. This
would very properly, in his opinion, precede
the jth, 6th and 7th fettions, which Itiould <
be incorporated into one, if the committee
were- disposed to retain in the bill ; but
he acknowledged, for his own part, that he
fbould prefer the ftrkmgof these out also, and
he suggested this modification to be adopted in
the event of a majority being-found to vote
againflexpunging them.
Mr. Njchoi.as supposed, that the striking
o*:t ot the 4th section had determined th' 3
<â  \
question. 1-fe could not conceive how jl.is
amendment could be necessary, IF, accordi. g
if) the gentleman's o(vn opinion, the Prel -
itent ha-. the power to employ thefc firffels . *
hi ple.tfes. He thought thai gentlemen ought
to be for prilcinjj out the whole fe&ion, as it
is directory to the. President how he {ball cm
ploy convoys.
Mr. Dayton said, tlut the adoption of
the aiueudment he had proposed was not, as
the member from Virginia infimiated, incon
sistent with the dodlrines he had held as to the
impropriety of directing by law, by 'whom and
in -what ivoy the naval force should be em
ployed. If amended as proposed, the bill
would not be directory to the President to use
the ships as convoys, but anly regulato'ry up
on the commanders, and upon the matters of
the merchantmen who might apply to be ta
ken under convoy. Th>*y mull produce cer
tain papers before, and do certain things af
ter, they were admitted to such protection,
and some doubt might portibly arise with some
of the captains of the private velfels, whether
they were bound in flrittnefs to obey the re
gulations without a legislative
Mr. Nicholas said, there niuft be some
misconception in the buiinefs ; for it was his
opinion that the gentleman from New-Jersey
had not read, ahd did not understand the
clanfe ; and when the committee hear it rea J ,
he believed they would be of the fame opini
on. That gentleman fays the section is for
the regulation of merchant vessels ; he (Mr.
N.) laid it was for the regulation of convoys.
Mr. N. read it as follows : >
" That uo merchant vessel hound from a port of
the United States, (hall be taken under the protec
tion and convoy of any public armed vessel, which is
deftiijed to any place, that is beCcged, blockaded or
mvefted; nor, unless fitisfa&'ory evidence -<s pro
duced to the co le&or, previous to her departure,
that tÂ£e vessel and cargo are bona fiJe, the property
of a citizen or citizens of the United States ; and if
bound to the ports of one of the belligerent powers,
that no goods, wares or msrehandize, contraband
by the general law of nations, or by any treaty to
which the United States are a party, are laden on
board the lame. Duplicate certificates of this ef
fect, ascertaining the natureand quality of the cargo,
lhall be furniflied by the collector of the diftrlet
where the cargo was laden, one of which lhall be
delivered to the commanding officer of the convoy,
and the other retained by the captain of the nur
chantveffels. And in cases where merchant veffek
of the United States are to be taken under convoy,
bound from foreign ports; certificates of the fame
nature, including the fame provisions, lhall be ob
tained from the consul resident at such ports, one of
which lhall be delivered to the commander of the
convoy, acd if no consul Ihould be eftablilhed â¢ at
such port, then certificates containing evidence of a
like nature attested by two witnesses and taken
before a judge, magiftratc, or notary public, lhall be
procured."
Mr. Otis was in favour ofthe motion. He
had, however, no doubt that if the fedtion
was struck out, it would still be in the power
of the President to employ the velfels as he
should think proper; and he could fee 110 con
tradiction between this amendment, and the
declafation of the gentleman from New-Jer
sey ; for, although the President ofthe Uni
ted States may have the right, as Commander
in Chief, when vessels are armed, to employ
them as convoys, yet it does not follow that
th_* Legillature (hall not point out the parti
cular manner in which they fha* be employ
ed, and under what /eftridions convoys shall
or fliall not be granted. The President is
Commander in Chief of the Army, and ofthe
militia when called out, b>it Congress mHit
nevertheless diredl the use of them. He be
lieved, therefore, it would be equally proper
to leave the employment of these vessels whol
ly to the President, or to direct .them to be
employed as convoys. The qurftion recurs
whether it is expedient to introduce these re I
gulations ; and, for his own part, he thought
them proper.
In our present relation with France, it was
his opinion, that the treaty betwixt the two
countries must be considered as annulled, by
; repeated and gross violations 011 her part.-
Whilst the treaty was in existence, a certain
mode of search was directed ; but the fubjeci
was now left at large, and some doubts might
anfe whether Captains of vessels should now
submit to a search. His opinion was that ev
ery attempt made by a Freiu.li armed vessel to
search our merchant velfels ought to be refitt
ed vtith force. But if this limitation was not
preferred, the President would, perhaps
feel himfelf under an obligation to grant con'
voys only under certain cafes
might occur in which the Captain of a con
voy would not fuffera vessel under his care to
be searched. He thought it better to talce
away this obstacle of search altogether that
our convoys might fail boldly throu tha
ocean, and refn't every attack made upon our
trade.
Mr. S. Smith said, he should be for stri
king out this leition altogether. Had this
proportion for convoys come forward during
their extraordinary fellion, he should then have
voted against it, because he then confi'dered
peace as within our graf'p. But he should be
againtt any thing being said in this bill about
convoys, as nothing had been said about con
voys in the Irigate bill. If a war took place
(and we mutt soon either have a war or a trea
ty with France) some of the directions given
111 this fettion for the employment of the vef
lels, would not be suitable to such a ttate of
things; and if a treaty could be â accompli di
ed, convoys would be unnecellary. It was
useless, he said, to place things in this half
way betwixt peace and war. The fubjeil was
taken up as a measure of.defence, but it might
soon become a meafitre of offence. He wish -
ed to flrike out every thing which relates to
convoys.
Mr. Harper did not think it of much im
portance whether ihefe feetions were retained
or not. He was, however, molt in favour cf
the mode pointed out by the gentleman from
Maryland, as he conceived the right of em
ploying these vessels as he pleafed'was placed
111 the bands of the President by the Conftitu
tioh, and he believed he did not want the in
firm, lions of thisHoufe how he was to employ
them. Whilst we remain at peace ' t we
could be considered in such a (late at this time)
he would doubtless adopt all those regulati
ons which should not interfere with a (fate of
peace; and if that ttate of things should be
changed, he would alio change bis mode of
acting.
Mr. Bayto:: was happy t 0 find that very
many members concurred with him in opinion
that the power of employing, these veflels as
lie thought proper, was ve.fted in the President
ot the United States J finding this to be the
cjfe, he would withdraw his motion, and'be
lVozo4tÂ£ XIII.in favour oÂ£itriking Put the sth, 6th aid 7th i
lections.âAs to the member from Virginia's e
not understanding him, he did not with to be f
understood by that gentleman, but by the 1
committee ;' for when he was urging argu- <
ments in favour of his own motion to strike (
out the 4th feftion, that gentleman represent- 1
ed him as arguing againlt it. '
The tilth, fix'tli and seventh feflions -were 1
then (true* out without opposition. <
Mr. S. Smith now moved to strike out fix- <
teen (the number of veflels to be employsd) ;
in the firft feftion, for the*puTpofe ot insert
ing twelve. He did not make this motion,
he said," because he thought sixteen too many, 11
but because he did not believe we could, in 1
any moderate time, put ia ftype more tjian I
' twelve. He took up thts idea from the report
of the Secretary of> War, now on the table,
which ltated that cannon could not be pro
cured for the two revenue cutters during the
recess of Congress; because also he thought
there would be some difficulty in procuring a 1
x fufficiency of men to man the three frigates
and twelve of these veflTel? ; and becaule he
thought this number of veflels, with proper
exertions, might be pmchafed and got to sea
in two months from the pafling of the law.â
When he said this, he meant that application :
should be made to the different ports in'the
Union, where he apprehended these veflels
might be met with, and such as were calcu
lated for the purpose. He would state luch
a divifipn ps this fprte as would appear to bim
proper. At Salem, fie supposed, one of these
veflels might be got ready; at Boston, one ot
the large and one of the (mall size; at New.
port, one of the largest size ; at New-York, !
Philadelphia and Baltimore, one of each size; 1
one at Norfolk of either of the two sizes ; and 1
one at Charlerton. At Baltimore, he knew
that one of his constituents had forfale a ves
sel in every refpeft fit to carry 22 or 24 guns, 1
a prime sailer, and which might be got ready â 
for sea in fix pr eight weeks. This was the 1
mode which he contemplated following; for '
if the veflels were to be built, it would re- 1
quire a year to get them ready, and then per- i
haps they might not be wanted. He was tor j
that kind of force which.cpuld be got without '
delay ; and he alfp wilhed to provide such as
should riCrt- too much exhaiiftour resource
Money, he said, defence ; oppress our
monfey resources, and the whole system will
Â» be oppreflfed.
Mr. gswAiL was sorry to differ in opinion
from a gentleman whose conduft in joining
heartily in effecting meaftires for the defence
of our country, since his cortviftion from the
late dispatches, with refpeft to the danger ot
our fituat'qn, mud have afforded great fatis
faftion to the public, The gentleman from
Maryland is for limiting the force, not be-'
cause .hc does not believe it to be neceflary,
but because he is of opinion more cannot be
got ready in time to be of fervke. He has
enumerated the ports at which he supposes
veflels may be got; hut he has omitted a
number from which the remaining tour ves
sels might ealily be He did not
mention Nev< burypcrt, where the frigate Alli
ance (one of the belt 111 the service) was built
in the late war. ,ln that neighbourhood, he
doubted not, all the four vessels might be
supplied. But Portfmouih wasalfo omitted,
at which place there lie materials which were
purchased for the frigates in the year 1794,
equal to the building one of these veflelsâ
Portland was also omitted ; (o tliat npthing
v quid be more easy than to supply the defi
ciency. As to our means with relpef.t to mo
ney, he believed there was a spirit existed in
the country on this occasion which would 1
provide the means ofour defence; and he be
lieved oirf'refources could not be better ap
plied than in procuring sixteen of these ves
sels.
Mr. Josiah Parker seconded the motion 1
in favour of twelve veflels, not becaule he
thought fiAeerv too many, but because he
thought it better to agree to such a force as 1
could immediately be got ready. He believed ;
that more men could not ealily be got than
would man the three frigates and twelve of
thele veflels, and it Would be doubtful whe
ther arms could be got for more. Hethought '
it jvould be well, however, to cause the ad
ditional frigates to be built, many oflhe ma
terials for which being on hand. He had no
doubt twelve veflels might be immediately
got. He had authority tp fay, that in pne ;
hundred davs, two veflels of 20 guns each, ,
could be built at Norfolk. Mr. P. regretted I
that wc had occasion to raise this force, ffe .
liad, before things came to this present crisis, |
thought it would have been well to have shut
ourselves up from European broils; but he
was now convinced of the neceflity of placing
ourselves in a posture of defence, and when
he recollefted we had 800,000 tons of (hip
ping, and betwixt 40 and'so,ooo failofs, who,
at 15 dollars a month, earn nine million dol
lars a vear, and who will, without the propo
sed protection, be thrown upon the wide
world, and probably be driven out of their
r country, and the capital which employs them
ba loft, he was dtffirous of taking such mea
sures. as wpuld produce the best and molt
prompt defence.
Mr. Brooks was in favour of the larger
number. Hp did not think the objections to
it well founded. The gentlemen from Vir
ginia and Maryland acknowledge that twelve
veflels can be procured within a few months ;
and if so, there could riot be great difficulty
in netting four mere. To the places menti
oned at which veflels could be procured,
mioht be added Hudson. With respeCt to the
mm; they were a mere bagatelle. There
would be no difficulty in obtaining nine
llatin was in favourofthe smal
ler number. He did not think they could be
employed upon any rational plan as convoys,
coulidering the extent of our coast and ton
nage ; but, in cafe of war, they might be used
along our coast to drive off privateers. 111
that cafe, although a larger number than six
teen rhight be wanted ; yet the twelve, with
the three frigates, would be as many as our
resources could conveniently meet tbe ex
penccs of; he (hould therefore be in favour
of that number. He dated the expence of
this armament, according to the eftiinate of
the Secretary of War, to be at the rate of
100,000 dollars for each veflel, and referred to
the expences already incurred and to be in
curred for our internal defence, in order to
(hew that twelve wc.ild be as many as could
be conveniently provided for at present.
Mr. Williams was hi favcur pt the a
niendment, because he thpught twelve vef
fels mpre than fufficient. There cpuld bfc
np doubt that any number of veflels might be
built and purchafea ; but it neceflary to
consider where the immediate resources could
be found to pay for them. 340,000 dollars
were already provided for our fortifications,
which he thought too much; alio, twelve
companies of artillery, which were, in his opi
nion, four companies too many, goo.ooodol-
Jars had been appropriated for cannon, arms,
See. though lu thought 600,000 would have
been fufficient; and the committee were now
called upon to vote for lixteen veflels, when
1" thought half the nvrtnber might fuffice.â
They had been told that our revenue would
be found equal to every expence; but to make
â¢
â¢
1 it so, they had also teen told, that the land- 9
ed interest mud be called upon for three,
four, or five millions of dollars a year. He
knew the landed property of this country was
equal to any expence, and in cafe of a war
(which God forbid) both money and personal
service would be chearfully afforded ; but
when farmers "'were called upon to pay their
money, they would enquire into the propriety
of this and that appropriation.'* They would
enquire into the bitfmefs of the frigates, and
alk how many revenue cutters we have. He
. had heard nothing said of them. If war was
to take place, we Ibouid want floating batte
| ries, gup boats, and the like, for the defence
of our ports and harbours. The question was
whet bier tliefe veflels were to be considered a!
&e defence of our sea cdaft pnly, or as for
convoys. If for the latter, ueitherfixteen nof
fixÃiid thirty would be fufficient; but for the
protection of the coast, and partial convoys,
he thought eight, with the three frigates and
cutters, would be adequate. It was of no
ule to fay vefTHs could be built here and there,
he would purchase those already built; ahd'
perhaps it would be proper to direct fix or
eight others built with the materials on hand.
It was true that our (hipping -amounts to
about 800,000 tons, or perhaps, deducting for
captures, it may be reduced to 700,000, and
that our seamen afhount to 40 or 50,000, a
great part o't which property and men would
be thrown out of employ, if protection in
some meaftire was not afrorded to our com
merce ; but he also knew that fevered sea
men of the Eastern States, finding their em
ployment of .late precarious, had fettled as
farmers in his neighborhood, and after a little
time were among the bell farmers in the coun
try. He thought it probable that others '
might take the fame course.
As to the commerce of this country, he
thought it had been extended too far., As an
agriculturalist, he would go all reasonable
lengths in thf protection of commerce ; but
when that commerce becomes so unwieldy
that it is not to protect one fourth of
it, he could not go the lengths that some
gentlemen were defirousof going for the pro
tection of it. Nearly five millions of draw
back were last year allowed to the merchants
of this country on goods imported, from
vrKfrh our arvenue has not beifn encreafedâ
He was ready to meet' tlie commercial gen
tlemen on this affertlon, and if twelve vefl'ets
wereagreed upon, he should propose an addi
tional duty on drawbacks, as well as some (ad
ditional dutiesoll articles of luxur>?s import
ed. He knew that the commercial and agri
cultural interests were intimately connected â
but he wilhed agriculture not to be too hea
vily burdened for the support of commerce.
If the landed interest were to be called upon
for three or dollars a year to pro
tect commerce, the country had better have
no cammsrce at all.
Mr. W. alked if the ftrengfh of the coun
try did not conlift in the number of its inha
bitants ? Does extensive commerce populate
the country ? It did not; it was a miitaken
zeal which drove men to pursue commerce
instead of agriculture, and to suppose that it
was that which served the belt interests of the
country. He did not believe it. At theclofe
of the late war, in 1783 and 1784, in the part
of the country from which he came, the peo
ple never (aw happier daysâtheir wealth
flowed in all fides; any quantity of money
could have been had; bu; two years after
wards, the people were drawn off from their
own domeflic manufactures, to purchase fo
reign commodities, and their state becaTne
completely changed. In the Eastern States,
in particular, manufactories were encreafing ;
but when foreign commodities began to flow
infuch abundance into the country, the home
manufadteries were annihilated, and the peo
ple got into debt.
This expensive proteftion of commerce had
long been forefeen, and on that â¢ ground the
establishment of a Navy had always been op
posed ; but the dispute with Algiers had un
happily given birth tp a Naval system, and he
feared it would impercpptibljr increase upon
11s ; and if the landed interest did not keep it
down, the whole commercial income would"
not support it. Mr. W. referred to the Na
vy of England, and said it had been the pa
rent of her immenf'e National Debt; and if
we went to any extent in the eftablifliment of
a Navy, we might bid adieu to the plan of pay
-1 ing off our national debt ; we (hould be for
i ever climbing the hill, and forever finking to
: the bottom. He was fatisfied the landed in-
I tereft would chearfully come forward to de
fend the country against iivvafibn, but not tor
extensive convoys to pro'teft our trade. He
had no objection to eight veflels for the pro
tection of our cpalt, and partial convoys to
our trade Trom depredations, which with the
frigates and cutters, he thought would be fuf,
ficient' "The Eastern States, he said, had
nothing to fear on their coast ; it was the sou
thern and middle states which flood most in
need of defence.
Mr. Macon said, the present debate was
a Wry uncommon one, for they were all upon
one fide. Tor his part, he was against build
ing or purchasing any veflels ; there was a
provision in the bill,jwhich had not been no
ticed, which was, that the President should <
have power to hire veflels, he hoped they j
would be hired, instead of being either pur- j
chafed pr built, as it would require much less |
money, and he believed money would be j
much wanted, if we were to go to war ; but
he did not think either 12 or 16 veflels would
be equal to the proteftion of commerce. He
did not think it neceflary to bring all the fub
jefts into the debate, which some gentlemen
had thpught it neceflary to introduce. If a
land tax was found (leceflary and laid, he had
rib doubt it would be collected. He wilhed
the question might be taken, and they might
get home, and dp fdmething towards railing
the money they were now about expending.
Mr. Harper had no doubt the landed in
terest would have sense enough to fee that the
connexion betwixt the commercial and agri
cultural interests was such, that whatever was
paid for the proteftion of one was paid for the.,
proteftion of the other. He should vote in
favour of this ftiotion, not for the reasons as
signed, but because he agreed in dpinion
' with the gentleman who made, and the gen
tleman who seconded thÂ« motion. He be
lieved such a number of veflels might be ef
fectually employed, and a greater number if
they could be immediately got; but he be
lieved twelve, with the three frigates, would
be as many as could be immediately got into.
' /revise, and by the lime they were got in rea
diness, it would be seen what farther num
ber were neceflary, and as twelve would com
, bine a more general vote than sixteen, he
should be in favour of that number ; not from
any apprehenfipns that the resources of the
country were npt equal tp the expence, or
that the people would be unwilling to bear it
âupon neifher of these points had he any he
(hation.
' The question was put and carried 49 tq 27.

From a retrofpeft of what has been,
a view of what is, ant) of what in all human
probability will be, we are bottijd by every j
couGderation to make preparation for the L
event. We have been once fcqrched by the
.ignis belli, and have found that endeavors
for itsextingoifhnient are better than flight :
for where nd obftru&ion is made,*it always
spreads far and wide and burns up natipns
to atoms. We must not expc& to raise up
men by Ramping on thegroinid, nor to ani
mate and humanize flones by catting them
Bvhintl us. A dependance upon mit-acles
wdold be our deltriiftion ; while an exer
tion of our power, would p tferve ourex
ifteixie, our government and our liberties.
In cafe we should be a prey to ihe rapac
ity of France without opposition, our fate
would be as deplorable, as if wp had met
force with force. We fhou!d not be admitted
to the privileges of conquered countries in
general, for that nation is implacable in tem
per and furious in revenge. No right of :
prflliminium, or renunciation of property j
acquired by arms neei] be looked for. We
should be colonized, laid under requisition, :
and (dire anticipation) fraternized. Is rxit i
then, the power to prevent such calamities '
to be enforced 1 Are we to stand idle spec- >
tators of preparation for our own zrnnihila- !

" there is no dangerâthe French will not
invade usâthey are not such fools." Yes
they are fools ? foolifh enough to commence
war without a cause enough to
invade England ; âfoolifh enough to defy
Omnipotence. In fliort, though it is said
" if any wish to become wife, let him firft
become afool," French foolifhnefs endur
ethfo long, that they would try to fool us
out of our independance, before their wis
dom would shew them the foolifhnefs of mak
ing the attemp .
The enthusiastic exceritricaties of their
rulers make them think impojfibilities attaina
ble. Some of them would believe it prac
ticable to under water from Calais to
Dover, or to convoy an army there in air
balloons ; or to lay a train of gun-powder
across the Atlantic, to communicate with a
mine which would destroy America with its
explosion ; or to build a bridge from conti
nent to Continent,as Xerxes did over theHel
lefpontâor to dig down to their antipodes.
From people of such characters, may we
not expedt invasion when it is threatened ?
1 have seen some people (whom Hotspur
would call "popinjays") who would fay,
" it is a very pretty fight" if the city was
on fire. Or. if the French were to give
the signal for battle against the American
army,thefe gentlemen (rather gentlewomen)
would exclaim the French music is exqui
site."
There is another description of men, who
would remove from the settlementsârun to

to be found within her borders ; but, of

are too many.
There are others again who are aware of
the danger and of the necessity of resistance;
but ashamed, or too ftobborn to surrender
French principles because they once held

ARISTIDES-
The fofl.on. ing curious inflance ef the vigilance
of the police Â«f Paris, under the ancient govern
ment, is extra fled from a " A Ireatife on the
Police of London" ; a new and interefling
,work, which is now in the press, and will be
publi/hed the latter end of this month. - -
A merchant ofhigh refpeinability in Boor
deaux, had occasion to vjfit the metropolis up
on commercial business, carrying with him bills
and money to a very large amount.
On his arrival at the gates of Paris, a genteel
looking' man opened the door of his carriage,
andaddreflfedhim to this efifed : 'Â« Sir, 1 have
been waiting for yen some time ; according to
my notes you were to arrive at thiÂ» hour, and
your person, your carriage", and your portman
teau exaiSUy answer tne description I hold in
my hand, you will permit me to have the hon
our of conducing you to Monsieur de Sartine."
, The gentleman aftonilhed and alarmed at
this interruption, and Dill mure so at hearing
the name of the lieutenant of the police men
tioned, demanded to know what Monsieur de
Sarur.e wanted with him, adding at the fame
time, th.;t he never had committed any offence [
*aÂ»(ai,:itf the laws, and that he could have ne (
right to interrupt or detaihhiin.
she mtfTenger declared himfelf perfectly ig- '
liorant of the cause cfthe detention, stating at 1
the fame time, that uhen he had condu&ed t
him to Monsieur de Sartine, he (hotildhave ex
ecuted his order?, which were merely mintfterial. ]
After some further explanations the gentle- (
man permitted the officer to condufl hirÂ» ac-
eording ; y. Monsieur de Sartine received him
with great politeness ; and after requesting him J
to be seated, to his great astonishment, he '
deferibed his portmanteau, and told h : m the ex- \
ail sum in bills and specie, which he hadbrought i
with hira to Paris, and where he was to lodge, )
his usual time of going to bed, and a nulnber of
other iircumflancfs, which the gentleman had
conceived could only be known to himfelf.â 1
Monsieur de Sartine, having thus excited atten- '
tirnj, pm this extraordinary queftiorr to himâ '
â¢' Sir, are you a mm of courage }" The gen- <
tleraan, ftillmnreaftoÃilhtd at the Angularity of t
tich an interrogatory, demanded the reason c
why he put such a strange question to him, ad- t
ding at the fame time, that no man ever doubt- .
ed his courage. Monj. de Sartine replied â" Sir,
you are to be robbed and murdered this night ! '
If you are a man of courage, you must go to t
your hotel, and retire to reft at the usual boor, c
but be careful that you do not fall a-fleep; nei
ther will it be proper for yoa to look under the
bed, oi -into any ot the clofcts which arc in your (
bed-chamber Jwhich he accurately defciibed)
you mull place your portmanteau in its ulual c
situation near your bed, and discover no fufpl '
cion j leave what remains to meâlf, however. ' Â£
you do not. feel your courage fufficient to bear t
you out, J v/iil procure a person, who fhail per- j
fonate you, and go to bed in your stead." j
After some farther explanation, which con
vmceil the gentleman that Mons. de Sartine's 1
intelligence was acgurate in every particular, he 1
refufe-d to be personated, and Formed an imme- <
diate refolntion literally to foh<iw the directions <
he had teceiv.d : he accordingly went to bed at j
his usual hour, which was eleven oVlock. At (
half pafl twelve (the time mentioned by M.
de Sartine) the dojr of the bed-cham
her hurst open, and three men entered with a '
dark lautern, daggers and piltols. The gen- 1
tiernan who of eourle was awate, perceived one 1
of them to be his own servant. They rifled his
portmanteau undisturbed and fettled the plan t>f ,
puttiag him to death. The gentleman hearing
all this and not knowing by what means he was
to be refaued, it may naturally be fÂ»ppofed, was
under great perturbation of mind during fucli an
awful interval of fufpence ; when at the mo
ment the villains were preparing to commit this (
horrid deed, four police officers, ailing under i
Mons. de Sartine's orders, who were concealed
under the bed, and in, the closet rnfhed out and
seized the offenders, with the property in their
possession, and in the adt of preparing to commit
the murder. The consequence was the perpe
tration of the atroeinus deed was )}reÂ»ented, and
fufficicnt evidence obtained to conviil the off
enders. Mons. de Sartine's intelligence enabled
him to prevent this horrid a<sl of robbery and
murder; which but for the accuracy of the
system, would probably have been carried into
execution.
Mons. de Sartine, it seems, kept a (harp lÂ»ok
oat for these democratic vermin : he had coni
pleat lifts of their whole fraternityin France, and
he watched eirery step they took from one end
of the kingdom to the other Had all his fuc
ceflors ufsd the fame activity and vigilance,
the good king Louis would be fitting on his
throne at this day, and forr? of the conspirators
would have been exalted in chains, or labour
ing in the galliei. But the police was much re
laxed ; the brigands were fufiered to prowl
through the country ; and from robbijig and ,
aflaffinating individuals, they rose in a climax
of crimes to rob and mutder nations.
Twenty thousand of these ruffians were em
ployed by the philosophical illumines to regene.
rate their eountrymen. They were the heroes
of the ioth of August and the ad of September,
who put the finifhing hand to the fatal revolu
tion in France; and men of the fame character
have since that period convulsed and disorganiz
ed all Europe.
Iftheff be the fort of nerves that the Auro
ra boasted of on a late occafioti, and I really
fufpeel the young philosopher means no other,
God preserve me, and ail whom I love, from
their regenerating cuttoes.
However, be this as it mayâas ir. one of those
dreams of philosophy, with which the body po
litic has beeu greatly peltered, we have let a
wide door open for the reception of flrangers
of all countries and descriptions, (some of whom
are hardly landed before they begin to reform
our government, while others reiume their old
trades of house-breaking and highway-robbing)
it will not be amiss to learn fiom our older
states how to manage such gentry, and how to
guard our lives and eftatesfrom their depreda
tions. The proper Jludy of man is man -, and it
ought more cfjJecially to be the study of those,
who are placed as watchmen, on the walls of
our Z.ion, whose office it is to " magnify the
law," and to render it the " terror of evil do
ers." The growing corruption of manners and
ptincip'es, the frequent conflagrations, robbe
ries and murders committed of late, not only
evince some great imperfedlion in the laws, or
negligence in the execution, but are alarming
symptoms of depravity, that menace still more
extensive evils.

THE STANDâNo. VI.
'f
The inevitable conclusion from the faÂ£b
which have been presented is, that revolu
tionary France has been and continues to be
governed by a spirit of proftlytifm, con
quell, dbmination and rapine. The detail
well juftifies the position that we may have
to contend at our very doors for our inda
pendenpe and liberty.
When the wonders atchieved by the arms
of France are duly considered, the possi
bility of the overthrow of Great-Britain
fcems not to be chimeiical. If by any of
those extraordinary coincidences of circum
stances which occasionally decide the fate of
empires, the meditated expedition againfl
England shall succeed, or if by the iihmenfe
expsnfe to which that country is driven,
aivfl the derangement of her commerce by
the powerful means employed to that end,
her affairs shaH be throwu into such difor
der as may enable France to dilate to her
the terms of peace; ia either of these un
fortunate events, the probability is, that
the United States will have to choqfe be
tween the surrender of their sovereignty,
the new modelling of their government ac
cording to-the fancy of the direiÂ£Wyâthe
emptying of their wealth by contributions
into die coffers of the greedy and iufatia
!>le munfterâand resistance to invasion, in
order to compel lubmiffiou to those ruinous
conditions.
lii Â©ppofition to this, it is suggested that
theinterelt of France, concurring with the
difficulty of execution, is a fafe-guard a
gainst the enterprise. It is aiked, what
incentives fufficiently potent can Simulate
to so unpromising an attempt ?
The answer is, the strongest paflions of
bad heartsâinordinate ambition, the love
of domination, that prime ehara&eriftic of
the despots of Franceâthe spirit of ven
geance for the of having
thought and afted for ourselves, a spirit
which has marked evefy step of the revolu
tionary leadersâthe fanatical egotism of o
bligitig the reft of the world to adapt their
political system tÂ» the French standard of
perfcftionâthe desire of securing the fu
ture control of our affairs by bumbling and
ruining the independent supporters of theie
country, and of elevating the partizans artd
tools of Franceâthe desire of -entangling
our commerce with preferences and restric
tions which would give to her the monopo
lyâthese paflions the- most imperious.;
these motives the most enticing to a crook
ed policy, arr fufficient- persuasives to un
dertake the subjugation of this country.
Added to these primary inducements,
the desire of finding au outlet for a part of
the vast ;irmies which, on the termination
of the European war, are likely t > perplex
and endanger the A-eii in power,would be an
auxiliary motive of great force. The to- '
tal loss of the troops sent would be no loss
Jo France. Their cupidity would be read
ily excited to the undertaking, by the prof
peÂ£ of dividing among themselves the fer
tile lands.of this country. Grear-Britnin
once silenced, there would be no infup-rable
obstacle to the traufportation. The divi
sions among us, which have been urged to
our eommiffioners a3 ode motive' to a com
pliance with the imreafonable demands of
the directory, would be equally encour
agement to iirvafion. It would be believed,
that a fuffi'cient number would flock to the
standard of France, to render it easy to
quell the resistance of the reft. Drunk
with success, nothing "would be thought too
arduous to be aceomplifhecl.
It is too much a part of our temper to
indulge an over-weening fecutity. At the
close of our revolution war, the phantom
of perpetual peace danced before the eyes of
everybodyâWe-fee at this early j'triod with
how much difficulty war has been parried,
and that with all our efforts to preserve
peace, we are now in a state of partial hos
tility. Untaught by th's experience, we
now seem inclined to regard the idea of in
vasion as incredible, and to regulate our
conduft by the belief of its improbability.
Who would have thought eighteen months
ago, that Great-Britain would have been
at this time in serious danger of an invasion
from France ? Is it not now more probable
that such a danger may overtake us, than
it was then that it would so soon assail Great-
Britain i
. There are currents in human affairs,
when events, at'other times little less than
miraculous> are to be considered as natural
and simple. Soch were 'the stras of Mace
donian, of Roman, of Gothic, of Sara
â  cen inundation. Such is the present sera of
French fanaticifm. Wife men, when they
difeover the symptoms of a similar asra,
look for prodigies, and prepare for them
with forefight and energy.
Admit that in our cafe invasion is upon
the whole improbable ; yet if there are a
ny circumstances which pronounce that the
apprehension of it is not abfolulely chimer
ical, it is the part of wisdom to aft as if
it was likely to happen. What are the in.
convenience-) ef preparation compared with
the infinite magnitude of the evil, if it /hall
surprise us unprepared ? They are lighter
than air, weighed against the fmalleftproh.
aWity of so disastrous a result.
But what is to be done ? Is it not wiser
to compound on any terms than to provoke
the canfeqaenccs os-resistance ?
To do this is dishonorâit-is ruinâit is
death. Waving other considerations, there
can be no reliance on its efficacy. The ex
ample of Portugal teaches us that it is to
purchase disgraceânot fafety.. The crav
ings of despotic rapacity may beappeafed,
but they are not to bo fatisfieii. They will
quickly renew their force, and call for new
facrifices in proportion to the facility with
which the firft were made. The situation
of France is likely to make plunder for a
considerable time to come, an indispensa
ble expedient of government. Excluding
the great confideratfons of public policy,
and bringing the matter to the.simple test
of pecuniary calculation, resistance is to be
preferred to submission. The surrender of
our whole wealth would only procure res
pite, not- fafety. The disbursements for
war will chiefly be at home. ' They will
not necessarily carry away our riches, and
they will preserve our honoi and give lib
security.
But in the event fuppofod, can we op
pofc with success ? There is no event in
which we may not look with confidence to
a fuccefsful resistance. Though Great
; Britain should be impolitic or wicked e
tiough (which is hoped to be impofiible)
, to cornpromife her differences with France,
f by an agreement todivide the United Statesac
. cording to the insulting threatofjhe agents of
f France, ft ill it is in our power to maintain our
L independence, and baffle every enemy. The
. people of tlie United States, from their num.
, situation and resources, are invincible,
, if they are provident and laithfulto them
j selves. Ij. 3 T H,.2 3 S
The qneftion returns, what is to be done?
r Shall we declare war ? Noâthere aÂ«e ft ill
. chances far avoiding a general rupture which
t ought to be taken. Waht of success may
. bring the prefect despots to reason. Every
( day may produce 3 revolution which may
. substitute better men in their place and lead
. to honorable accommodation.
3 Our trte policy is, i n the attitude of
. calm defiance, to meet the aggressions upon
j us by proportionate resistance, and to pre
i pare vigorously for farther resistance. To
tfeis end, the chief measures requisite areto invigorate our Treasury by calling into
activity the principal untouched
revenue âto fortify in earned our chief sea
ports âto establish founderies and increase
our arsenalsâto create a refpe&able haval
force and to raise with the utmost diligence
a considerable army. Our merchant vessels
ought to be permitted not only to arm them- '
selves but to fink or capture their assailants. 1
Our vessels of war ought to on our '
coast and serve as convoys to our trade.â 1
In doing this they ought also to be authori- 1
zed not only to fink oi; capture assailants,
but likewise to capture and bring in priva- 1
teers found hovering within twenty !
leagues of our --coast. For this last
measure, precedent, if is to be
found in the conduct of neutral powers on
other oecafions.
This conrfe, it will be obje&ed, implies
a state of war. Let it be soâBut it will be
a limited and mitigated state of war, to
grow into general war or not, at the ele&ion
of France. What may be that eleftion will
probably depend on future and incalculable
events. The continuation of success on the
part of France, would ensure war. The
â want of it might facilitate accommodation.
There are examples in which states have been
for a long tims in a state raf partial hoflility
without proceeding to general rupture.â
The duration of this cotirfe of conduit on
our part may be reltrifted to the continu
ance of the two last decrees of France ;
that by which the trade of neutrals with the
ports of her enemies has been intercepted,
and that by which vessels and their cargoes
composed in whole or in part of Britifli fa
brics are liable to feizureand condemnation.
Tbe declared"suspension of our treaties
with France is a measure of evident justice i
and necessity. It is the natural consequence
â¢of a total violation on one fide. It would
be preposterous to be fettered by treaties
which are wholly disregarded by the otfier
party. It is essentially our interest to get
rid of the guarantee in the treaty of alliance
which on tfce part of France is likely to be
henceforth nugatory ; on the part of the â¢
United States it is a substantial and dange
rous stipulation, obliging them in good faith
to take part with France in any future, de
fenfive war in which her Weft-India colo
nies may be attacked. The consular con
vention is likewise a mifehievous instrument
devised by France in the spirit of extending
her influence iuto other countries, and pro
ducing to. a certain extent imperium in
IM-perio.
It may be happy for the-United States
that an occafionhas been furttiftiedby France
in which with good faith they may break
thro' these trammels ; re-adjusting, when
reconciliation (hall take place, a basis of con
nection or intercourse more convenient and
more eligible.
The rsfolution to raise an army, it is to
fee feared is that one of the measures fuggeft
cd which will meet with the greatest obstacle
âand yet it is the one which ought to unite
opinion. Being merely a precaution for in
ternal security, it can in no sense tend to
provoke war ; and ta eventual iecu
jity in a cafe which if it should happen would
threaten our very exillence as a- nation, it is
the most important.
The history of our revolution war is a fe
â¢rious admonition to it.. The American
cause had nearly been loft for want of crea
ting in he firft instance a solid force, com
uienfurate in duration with the war. Im
mense additional expence and waste and a
variety of other evils were incurred which
might have been avoided.
Suppose an mvafioiij and that we are left
to depend on militia aloneâCats it be doubt
ed,thata rapid and formidable progTefs would
in the firft instance be made by the invader ?
Who can answer what dismay this might in
spireâhow far it might go to create general
panicâto rally under the banners-os the e
Â»emy the falfe and the timid ? The imagin
ation cannot without alarm anticipate the
eonfeqiipnces. Prudence commands that
they (hall be guarded against. To have a
good army on foot will be the best of all
precautions to prevent a? well as to repel
ir.vafion.
â¢The propriety of the measure is fÂ® pal
pable, that it will argue treachery or inca
pacity in our councils, if it be not adopted.
The 'friends of the government owe it to
their own characters to press it ; its oppofers
can give no better proof that they are not
abandoned te a fpreign power than to
cur in it. The public fafety will be more
indebted to its advocates than to the advo
cates of any other meaiure, in proportion
as our Independence and Liberty are of
more consequence than our trade.
It is the fervent with of Patriotism that
our Councils and nation may be united and
resolute. The dearcft interests call for it.
A great public danger commands it. Cve
ry good man will rejoice to embrace the ad
versary of his former opinions if he will now
bv candor and energy evince his atta hment
to his country. Whoever does not do this
consigns himfelf to irrevocable dilhonor.â
But it is not the triumph over a political ri
val, which the true lover of his country de
is the fafety and .the welfare of that
countryâand he will gladly (hare with his
bitterest opponent, the glory of defending
and preserving her. Americans rouse ! be
unanimous, be virtuous, be firm, exert
your courage, tfuft in heaven, and nobly de
fy tha enemies both of Goo and Man . .

ESCAPES.
The citizens were, alarmed yesterday, a
bout noon, by the ringing of the bells, It
proved to be a call to the gaol, which had
been broken open by the prisoners, princi- ,
pally debtors, twenty four of whom had ef- 0
caped. t
A circumstance of this kind interests eve- ''
ry class of men, we have therefore taken
pains to obtain particulars, which are thus .
datedâ f
A few moments before twd*e, upwards 1;
of forty prisoners, came driving down flairs '
in a body, armed with piflols, which had
spring bayonets affixed to them, and clubs. t
They knocked down the turnkey and as
saulted the front i ner door, tfie lock of f
which they absolutely bur ft off. Seeing op- '
position in front of the prison collecting, '
they flew to the rear of the house, and pried
their way through into the yard, firing at <
every one who opposed them, and forced e
their way through a crÂ«>ud of officers and '
citizens who found it. impossible to stem their
impetuosityâbut, by (kill and numbers, r
the officers and citizens retook ten of them t
through the fire of all their pistols ; not 1
ut receiving many wounds. '
The other fourteen made a fuccefsful escape: â 
their names fee in the (heriff's advertisement ,
iri this paper, bj which 200 dollars are of- i
for their apprehenfian. Those taken '
were put in the dungeon.
The officers <sf the gaol appear to have j
faithfully performed their dutyâwhat man, ,
I unconscious of design, cpuld oppose such a i
torrent.
Their being armed in fach a manuer, may '
be fomewhat mysteriousâbut (
these could easily have been fmuttgled in ,
from time to time, by the the i
prisoners.
Many citizens acquired much credit by
their exertfons, at the risque of their lives,
in aiding the magistrates in this moment of ; <
alarm. There are many~eridences a'.fo of
the vigilance of the officers ; Mr. William |
W. Parker, deputy fheriff, took two of the :
prisoners himfelf, each armed with pistols:
and we are told that this is not the firft in
stance-os fiis exertions in cases of this kind.
It pains us to mention tlie fate of our
worthy .fellow-citizen, Mr. Peter Lorillard,
tobaccojiift, in Chatham street ; he receiv
ed a ball thro' his body, from one of the
prisoners, after he had retaken him, and his
state was conceived very dangerous last. e
vening*
One Long, a carman, unfortunately re
ceived four wounds in his body and limbs, '
with buck ftiot, but they were not conceiv- |
ed dangerous. Three ether citizens were
(lightly wounded. Watson, now in the
dungeon was badly wounded before he re
signed. - (Argus. J
JAIL - MUTINr.
We have to record an extrpqnely unplea
sant occurrence of yesterday.
Abbut 12 o'clocK, a number of prisoners,
/ome confined for debt, others for forgery
an i swindling, armed with pistols, &c. made
a defeent upon the Turnkeys, and with the
.most undaunted proceedings forced their
way through the doors. Having got out,
they had to contend with a body of citizens
called together by the alarm, and who, to
prevent their escape, made Â»fe of various j
means to secure them ; and here we arefor
â¢ ry to fay, that Mr. Peter Lorillard, a ref
pettable tobacco manufa&urer, was ftiot
through the body by one of the efcapeants
and is now expiring. One or two other ci
tizens were slightly wounded ; a Mr. Wat
son, prisoner, dangerously so.
The agitation produced by this affray has
rendered it impossible to be particular.
Not more than four,or five, got off, the
reft rest-are dungeoned. It is not yet as
certained who (hot Mr. Lorillard.
Placed as Mr. Hazard, the keeper was,
no man could have behaved with more be
coming firmnefs ; and since the return of
those mifguiaed objects of legal severity,
Mr. Hazard's tenderness and humanity has
excited even their thanks. [Daily Gaz.

unanimity, of a cordial and brotherly coa- si

this, wish, joined with the profpeel we now ai
have of this unanimity, that flrike the pangs n
of hell through Bache and his aflbciates in
French corruption, & blasts the vile proje&s A
they have so long foftered with an adder's ' N

py proTpedl which injvigoratei the wing's of J
the American eagle, and it a
flight far aV.ove the efforts of foreign influ
ence and corruption, or domestic faftion
and treafori'. But the two Presidents are
spoken of with refpeS, and this offends the
delicacy of Bache. And if I shall ever fee
the day when my countrymen shall forget
the ferviccs of a Washington and an A
damj, when the recolle&ion and applaufr
of them shall be' unwelcome to their ears, I n
shall fee the clay when American virtue and j

goes on to fay that the Anglo-monarchical E
party "in the fury of their exultation,
threatened to throw over or otherwise ill
treat every perfori who did not join hearti

person at the theatre, and Baclit him [elf anas 1
there, knows it to be so. He then goes 11
on to abuse the managers, and asked why
the ore he lira refufed to play Ca Ira when
repeatedly called sor âa lie âone or two
â¢weak folitary voices, it is tr je, one of
wMch was probably Bache, and the other
his friend and companion Callender, called j
! once or twice in a feeble tone for Ca Ira,
but Were instantly overwhelmed with loud J
and irrefiftable biffing, and a general call
for Stony Point, which was played.
I was akuut to remark tjjany other fslfe- '
hnods in this paltry effort of malice and
difappoiritment, but I have already spent 1
more time on the than he defervest
He concludes by inviting the republican
party if they go again to this temple of a
ristocracy, " at lead to go in a party fuffi
ciently flrong to pj-oteft themselves fiom
outrage, from insult and from degradation."
Infamous incendiary, who thus endeavors
to excite tumult and riot in a place of pub
lic amusement that might end with the mofl
serious consequences. Outrags or insult
have never been offered to any body there ;
and lam sure no American republican
will feel degradation at an American Song
that interferes with no party, but that, if
such a one there is, they hate American in
dependence, and would prostrate us at the
feet of France, paying tribute for our ex
istence, and licking the feet that tread on
US. AN AMERICAN.
S>uere. Why did Bache, on Wednesday
evening after the play was over, fend his
compliments to Mr- Fox, and request a
copy of this vile Anglo-monarchic Song ?
ExtraS of a letter from 80/lon, dated 22nd
April, 1798.
" As to our political appearance we have
not looked or felt so well for. two years back.
Sincs the communications have been made
public, there seems to be but one sentiment
in this quarter. We may possibly have ten
or a dozen headstrong fools,or bribed knaves
that may yet juftify one of the raoft corrupt;
arid abandoned governments, if it may be
â called a government, that ever existed. But
these Fools and Knaves at present have judg
ment enough to keep out of fight."
