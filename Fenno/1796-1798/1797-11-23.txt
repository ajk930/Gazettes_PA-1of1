Mr. R bed presented a petition from Ja- 1

cate which had been destroyed by fire. n
Mr. Elsundorph also presented peti- "
tions from Jacob Hofbiook and George c
Frost the former to have certificates fund
ed which had not been presented in time, J
and the latter for a newjand warrant for one L
which he had loft. , f
The above petitions were referred to the j
committee of claims ; as was also that of
Frederick Cyrus, presented yesterday. 1
" Mr. Findley presented the memorial of *
Benjamin Wills, collefter of revenue, who
states, that in the years 1791, 179 2 > 1 793 j
and 1794, and particularly in the lalt year, v
he had been greatly obilrufted in the per- Â«
formance of his duty by persons opposed to
the laws which he had to execute, by which t
he had experienced considerable loss and in- t
jury. He acknowledges having received
from the commissioners, in purfuancc of the ; I
aft passed on this fubjeft, upwards of Soo
dollars, but this sum being inadequate to his r
conopenlation, he prays for further relief. t
Mr. Findley moved that this memorial, '
being i Angular ease, and the petitioner be- Â«
ing in town waiting the iflue of his applica- c
tioii, should be referred to a feleft commit- '
tee. This motion wa6 fecomkd by Mi - . 1
Hartley, and opposed by Melfrs. C,oif
Macon, who were.of opinion that the b'jli- 1
liefj would come- properly nnder the cogiti- j
nance of the committee of claims, and that
it was deferable, in order to preserve an uui
formi'-y in their proceedings, to have this
and'all other claims referred to the ftand
ijg committee. Mr. Macon therefore mov- t
ed that this petition should be referred to 1
the committee of claims ; but, at the re- *
quest of Mr. Hartley hoth motions were <
withdrawn, and the petition was ordered to
lie on the table. Mr. Findley gave notice
be should call it up to-morrow.
A mefTage was received from the Senate,
informing the house, that the Senate had

Mr. Williams moved that a committee
be appointed jointly with to be appoint
ed by tha Senate, to wait upon the Presi
dent of the United States, to inform him
that quorums of both houses are assembled,
and are ready to receive any communications
which he may think proper tomake to them.
The motion was agreed to, and Messrs.
Otis, Rutledge and Dawfou were appoint
ed a commiitee for the purpose.
Mr. Rutubge presented a memorial ,
from the merchants of Charleston, complain- 1
ing of the operation of a law for the regu
lation of the ouftom-houfe at that place, by
which the "olleftor is to cause to be weigh
ed by his own officers, all goods and wares
imported, which were hrretofore weighed
by the proprietors of the wharves, who
kept persons for the purpose, and which ad
ded considerably to the value nt the private
property of individuals owning t.ne said
wharves: they Hate this grievance to have
put them to great inconvenience, and pray
for redress Referred to the Secretary of the
Treasury.
Mr. Coit observed that there were in his
opinion, some inconsistencies in the aft for
the encouragement and protection of the
ufeful arts. By this act, any person fvvear
ing that he is the inventor of any improve
ment, and paying the expence of the patent,
may obtain one ; ancl|ifai~.y person infring
es it, he ha 3 his remedy by suing him- Ihe
general scope of the aft did not go to define
who wss the real inventor ; this was left to
be determined. In the former aft on this
fubjeft, certain of the heads of the depart
ments were to determine whether any objeft
proposed for a patent was really a new in
vention. In looking farther into the aft he
found two clauses which he thought incon
fi4e-n't with the general tenor of the law
[these he read] and therefore moved that a
committee be appointed,to enquire whether
any, and if any, what alterations are ne
cessary to be made in the said -.ft.
Agreed and a committee of three mem
bers appointed. \
A mefTage was received from the Senate,
informing the house that they concurred
with them in the appointment of a commit
tee to wait upon the President, and that
they had appointed Meflrs. Bingham and
Tracy, a committee on their part.
On motion of Mr. Harper, the report of
the committee of revifal and unfinifhed busi
ness w?.s taken up, and the following reso
lution having been read, was agreed to .
Â« That all petitions depending and un
decided upon at the second session of the
fourth Congress, and at the last session,
ought to be taken up and aftcd upon by the
House, as the fame may be called for by any
ipember, or upon application of the indi
vidual clmfpant or petitioner.
Mr. Harper then observed thatamongtt
the unfiniflicd business, there was a report
oh the petition of Henry Hill, which was
favorable to the petitioner. He wished, as
the business had already been long before
the house, to have it early decided upon,
and wouldjmove therefore that it be referred
to a eommittee oftbewhole house. Agreed,
and made the order for Monday.
< A mefTage was received frcm the senate,
informing the house, that they had agreed
to a resolution for the appointment of two
chaplains, one for each house, to interchange
weekly and that they had appointed on
their part Bilbop White.
Mri Livingston fdid, amon;Â»fl the un- v
finifhed business, hs found a bill for the 1
relief of refugees from Canada sod Nova t
Scotia. He wilhed it to be referred to a t
committee of the whole. Agreed and made t
the order for Monday. t
Mr. Harper observed, that rovyards the r
close of the last session, a very di ft reding j
cafe was brought before the house, and t
postponed for want of time ; he meant that > {
of Antonia Carmichael, widow of William \
Carmichael. He moved that that report r
be referred to a committee of the whole, r
Agreed for Tuesday. t
Mr. Otis, from the committee appoint- t
ed to wait on the President of the United
States, reported that they had attended to c
the service, and that the President had fig- t
nified to them that he would make a com- a
munication to them to-morrow at twelve 1
o'clock in the representative chamber. <
Mr. Livingston said, there <v3s a re- i
port of a feleft committee on the operation t
of the aft for the relief and protection of '1
American Teamen, which included the sub- 1
jest of an establishment of a marine hofpilal, ;
snd other important matters. He wished 1
this fubjeft referred to a eommmittee of the <
whole. Agreed for Tijefday. i
Mr. A< Foster moved that a report of (
last session on the petition of George Cur- t
wen Ward, ke referred to tly committee of 1
commerce and manufaftures. Agreed. '
On motion of Mr. Coit, the report on j
cafe of North and Beazy, was referred 1
to a committee of the whole for Tuesday. 1
Mr. Venable thought it not right that ]
hufinefs which was pertcftly new to many <
members, should be thus referred to com
mittees of the whole. He did not think
the resolution of the committee of revifal i
and unfinifhed business went so fur. He 1
thought it meant only that the pttitidns
and reports should be taken up and read, '
and then difpof*d of as the house fiionld
think proper.
The speaker decided that the order taken
was agreeable to the reported refolation of
the committee of revifal and unfinifhed bu
siness, which had been agreed to.

PRESIDENT'S speech.
* s
this da r,
At Twelve o'Clocl, the PRESIDENT of
the United States, met both Houses of Con
gress, in the Chamber of the Representa
tives, where be addressed them in the follow
ing
SPEECH.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,
I was for some time apprehensive, that
it would be necessary, on account of the
contagious fickncft, which afflifted the city
of Philadelphia, to convene the National Le
gillature at some other place ; this measure
it was desirable to avoid, because it would
occasion much public inconvenience, and a
eonfiderable public expence, and add to the
calamities of the inhabitants of this city,
whose fufferings must have excited the fyni
pathy of all their fellow citizens ; therefore,
after taking meafurs to ascertain the state
and decline of the sickness, Ifoftponedmy
determination, having hopes, now happily
realized, that without hazard to the lives
or health of the members, Congress might
affemWe at this place, where it was next
by law to meet. I submit however to your
confederation, whether a power to pofipone
the meeting of Congress, without palling
the time fixed by the Coxftitution, upon
such occasions, would not be a ufciul amend
ment to the law of one thousand seven hun
dred and ninety four.
Although I cannÂ»t congratulate you on
the re-eftabUfhment of peace in Europe, and
the restoration of security to the persons,
and properties of our citizens from injufticc
and violence at sea ; we have neverthclefs
abundant cause of gratitude to the source
of benevolence and influence, for interior
tranquility and personal security, for propi
tious seasons, prosperous agriculture, pro
ductive fifheries, and general improvements ;
and above all, for a rational spirit of civil
and religious liberty, and a calm but steady
determimtiv<n to support our sovereignty, as
well as our moral and religious principles
against all open and secret attacks.
Onr envoys extraordinary to the French
republic embarked one in July, the other
early in August, td join their colleague in
â¢ Holland. I have received intelligence of
the arrival of both of them in Holland, from
1 whence'they all proceeded on their journeys
to Paris, about the 19th of September.
F Whatever may be the result of this mission,
- I trull that nothing will have been omitted
- on my part, to cont'.ift the ntgoeiation to a
fuccefsfulconcluGon, onfuchequitableterms,
- as may be compatible with the fafety, hon
: or, andintereft of the United StatesâNoth
, ing in the meantime, will contribute so much
eto preservation of peace, and the attain-
Y ment of justice, as a manifeftatiÂ«n of that
- energy, and unanimity of which on many
former oceafions, the people of the United
I States have given such memorable proofs,
t and the exertion of those resources for na
s tional defenfe, which a beneficent providence
s has kindly placed within their power,
e It may be confidently afTerted, that noth
,, ing has occured, since the adjournment of
J Congress, which renders, inexpedient, those
I, precautionary measures, recommended by
me, to the confederation of the two houses,
:, at the opening of your late extraordinary
d session âlf that system was then prudent, it
o is more so now, as increasing depredations
e strengthen the reasons for its adoption
ti Indeed, whatever may be the ifiue of the
negocfation with Frar.ce, and whether thf

the ftstc of focjetjr hos so!-. ~ b:en difl-v.rfi
ed, the sense of moral and religious obliga
tion so much weakened, public faith, qnd G
national honor have been so impaired, res- â¢ ge
pest to treaties, has been so diminiflied, and of
the law of nations has loft so much of its â  di
force ; while pride, ambition, avarice, and or
violence,havebeen so long unrellraincd, there th
remains no reasonable ground, an which to ar
raise an expeftation, that a commerce with- th
out proteftion, or defenfe will not be plun- d<
dered. it
' The commerce of the United States is fil
essential, if not to their existence, at lead
to their comfort, their growth, prosperity fc
and happiness ;âThe genips, character, an
and hibits of the people are Highly commer- fie
cial, their cities have Wen formed, and ex- fu
ift'upoa commerce ; otir agrioulture, fifh- th
cries, arts and rranufaft nreff, are connefted pi
with and depend upon it; in (liort, com- bi
merce has made this country what it is ; b}
and it eannot be, destroyed or negltfted, b<
vithont involving the peopl-" in poverty and in
diftreft ; âgreat numbers are directly and oi
solely supported by navigation ; the faith hi
of society is pledged for the preservation of th
the rights of tommercial, and sea faring ; ce
no less than of the other citizens ; under this ce
view of our affairs, I (hould hold myfelf fr
guilty of a negleft of duty, if I forbore to j
recommend, that we fliould make every j qi
exertion to proteA our commerce, and to | fn
place our eountry in a suitable poÃure of l ai
defenfe, as the only sure means of preferv. j q<
ing both. ' j fÂ«
I have entertained an expeftation, that j ai
it would have been in my power, aÂ» the I ei
opening of this ftflion, t<6 have communica- j S
ted to you, the agreeable information of: h
the due execution of our treaty with his e
Catholic Majesty, refpefting the withdiaw- j d
ing of his troops from our territory, and h
the demarcation of the lineof limits, but by C
the Inteft authentic intelligence, Spanish
garrisons, were ft ill continued within our ri
country, and the running of the boundary tl
line, had not been commenced, these cir- y
cumftances are the more to be regretted, as t;
they cannot fail to affeft the Indians in a
manner injurious to the United States, still v
however, indulging the hope, that the an- c
fwers which have been given will remove the f
objeftions, offered by the Spanish officers n
to the immediate execution of the treaty, e
I Cave judged it proper that we (hould con- r
tinue in readiness to receive the pods, and e
to run the line of limitsâfurther informa- c
tion on this fubjeft will be communicated si
in the course of the feflion. f
In conneftion with this unpleasant (late d
of things, on our western frontier, it is- u
proper for me to mention, the attempts of o
foreign agents to alienate the affeftions of v
the Indian nations, and to excite them ten
aftual hostilities agaiuft the United States ; r
great aftivity has been exerted by those 1
persons, who have insinuated themselves a
mong the Indian tribes, residing within the i
territory of the United States, to influence j
them to transfer their affeftions and force to
a foreign nation, to form them iotft â¢ ion- <
federacy, and prepare them for war agaiuft
the United States. Although measures j
have been taken to counteract these infrac- j
tioitÃ of our rights, to prevent Indianhhost
tilitics, and to prcferve entire their attach- \
ment to the United States, it is my duty to t
observe that to give a better effeft to these (
rtieafures, and to obviate the consequences ,
of a repetition of fiich praftlce3 a law pro- t
vidiug adequate pjinifhment for such offen- j
ces may be necessary. ;
The commissioners appointed under the
fifth article of the Treaty of Amity, Com- â¢
merce and-Navigation, between the United
States and Great Britain, to ascertain the
river, which was truly intended under the
name of the river St. Croix mentioned in the
treaty of peace, met at Pafiawaquaddy bay
in October, one thonfancl feveu hundred and
ninety fix, and viewed the mouths of the
rivers in question, and the adjacent shores
aRd Islands, and being of opinion, that ac- 1
tual surveys of both rivers to their sources
were necessary, gave to the agents of the j
two nations inftruftions for that purpose,
and adjourned to meet at Boston in August :
they met, but the surveys requiring pore
time than had been fuppofefl, and not being
then compleated, the commissioners again
adjourned to meet at Providence, in the (
State of Rhode Island, in June next, when
we may expeft a final examination and deci
sion.
The Commiflioners appointed in purfu
ance of the sixth article of the Treaty, met
at Philadelphia in May lad, to examine the (
claims of Biitiflv fubjefts, for debts contrast- ,
ed before the peace," and still remaining due
to them from citizens, or inhabitants of the
United States. Various causes have hither
to prevented any determination, but the
business is now resumed. and doubtless will
be prosecuted without interruption.
Severel decilions on the claims of citizens
of the United States, fpr losses and dama
ges sustained, by reason of irregular, arid
illegal captures or condemnation of their
vessels, or other property have been made
by the commissioners in London, conform
ably to the seventh article of the Treatyâ
The sums awarded by the commissioners
j have been paid by the British government,
I a considerable number of other claims, where
j costs and damages, and not captured proper
! ty, were the only objefts in t}ueflion, have
! j been decided by arbitration, and the sums
! ewarded to the citizens of the Uuited States
have also been paid.
The commissioners appointed, agreeably
p to the tweuty-firft article of our Treaty
. with Spain met at Philadelphia, in the sum-
I mer palt, to examine and decide on the
cWims of our citizens for losses, they have
' sustained in consequence of their vessels and
cargoes, having been taken by the fubjefts
5 of his Catholic Majesty during the late war
between Spain and France their fittings j
. have been interrupted, but are new refu-1
5 ir.ed.

armed in ports of the United .States, upon
the award? of the coinmifiio iers, acting un
der the fevrmh article of the fame Treaty,
it is weeeiTary that pvovifion be made for fill- ,
filling these obligations. ,
The numerous captures of American vef- j i
fek by the cruizers of the French Republic,
and of fume by those of Spain, have occa- '
j fioued cor.fiderable expences in making- antl
| supporting the claims of our citizens, before
' their tribunalsâthe films required for this (
purpose have in divers instances, been dis
bursed by the Consuls of the Uniced States ;
by means of the fame captures, great num
bers of our feamcn, have been thrown ashore
. in foreign countries, destitute Â©f all mean*
of fubftftence, and the iick in particular
have been exposed to grievous fufferingsâ
the Consuls have in these cases also advan
; ced monies for their relief ; for these advan
i ces, they reasonably expfeft reimburfemeflts
: | from the United States.
> I The consular aft relative to seamen re
' ! quires tevifion 3nd amendment ; the provi
i ! fion for their support is foreign countries,
F â  and for their return, are found to be inade
- j quale and ineffectual. Another provision
j seems necessary to be added to the consular
: j aft ; some foieign vefTels have been difcov
: ered failing under the flag of the United
- i States, and with forged papers ; it seldom
f: happens that the Consuls can deleft this dc
-5 ception, becanfe they have no authority to
-j demand aa infpeftiou of the registers and sea
1 ! letters.
' Gentlemen of the Monfe of Reprefntativer,
> It is my duty to recommend to your fe
r rious confideratioi, those objefts, which by
t the constitution, are placed particularly
- within your sphere, the national debts and
> taxes.
i Since the decay of the feudal system, by
1 which the public defence was provided for,
â¢ chiefly at the expence of individuals, the
t Tyllfm of loans has been introduced ; and as
s no nation can raise, withia the year, by tax
, cs, fufficient sums for its defence and milita
ry operations in time of war, the sums loan
-1 ed, and debts contraftcd have necefTarily be
- come the fubjedts of what have been called
1 funding systems ; the consequences arising
from the constant accumulation of public
5 debts, in other countries, ought to admonish
s â  us, to be careful to prevent their growth in
f our ownâthe national defence must be pro
f vided for as well as the support of govern
e men:, but both (hould be accomplished as
; much as pofliblc by immediate taxes, and as
e little as pofliblc by loans.
The estimates for the ferviÂ«e of the ensu
e ing year will by my direftion be laid before
t you. !
3 Gentlemen of the Senate, and
- Geutlemen of the House of Reprefentgtives,
t Wt are met together at a rnoft interesting
s period ! Tlie fmntions" of the principal
> powers of Europe, are lingular and porten-
I- tous : connected with Tome by treaties, and
i- with all by commerce, no important event
o there, can be indifÃrjiit to us : Such cir
c cumftances call with peculiar imoorlunity,,
â a not less for a disposition to unite, in all those
>- measures, on which the hosour, fafety, and
i- prosperity of our country depend, than for
all the exartions of wifdotn and firmnefs.
e Tn all such nieafures, yon may rely on my

BY order of the United Kta;es, Unule
lia? been ereAted it the Clay. Pomls, on Cape
Cod; the lamps in which are to be lighted 011
the 15th inil. The light house i. on,
I land elevated abcut ijo feet, which with the e
levation oi the Lantern makes the who'eheighth
203 feet above high water mark. Jrt order that
this Light may be diftinguillied from the Boflon
and other Light* en ourcoafl, an Eclipfer is e
reiJled, which will revolve around the LamÂ£s
once in 80 fecondsfo that thelight will he near
ly excluded from the eye of the approaching
mariner about thirty seconds, in one revoluti
on of the eclipfer. To render the benuvolent
designs of Ctulfcrrefs Â»s Â«wten[ively ufeful as pos
sible, the Marine Society in Boston, by a large
Committee from their body, whole views have
been ieconded by others, have taken such dis
tances and bearings as ther thought neceflary ;
which obfervatious giving light and fafety are
for the benefit of all interestedâand are
as follows
VcJels outward brund, from Boston Light
house, and would with to faltin with Cape-Cod
the course is E. S.-Â£. distance 15 leagues, thence
3 leagues to the Light house. When up with
the L ght-houfe and it bears S W 2 leagues dif
,' tance, you then fleer SS E which wjll carry
yo'i out of the south channel.
. Veflels inward bound, and fall in with the
back of Cape-Cod, bring the Light to bear S W
2 leagues distance. then you may fleer WNW
for Boflon Light-House.
IF you you would wish to go into Cape Cod
harbor, you may keep the (hore aboard about
a mile distant, wliere you will have 10 fathoms
water. TherÂ« is a bar lies oft" the back of the
Cape, about half a mile from the ihore.
When up with Race-point, which is very
bold, and about three leagues to theweflward of
the Light-house, and maybe known by a num
ber of fi(h houses on it, from 1 to 3 miles to
the southward of Race-point, is what it called
Herring Cove, where you rmy hawe good an
ehering half a mile from the (hore, tho wind
from E to N N E in 4 or even 3 fathom water.
If bound into Cape Cod harbor, your course
from Racerpointta Wood end, i< S S E 6 miles
distance, bring the light to bear E by N and
run for it about two miles, you will' then he
clear of Wood endâthen you mult fleer N E
until the light bears E by Sâthen run >T W
f.r the harbor, until you have from 4 to 3 i-a
fathoms water, where you have good anchor
ing, the Light then will bear E by S i-Â» S 5 or
6 miles distance.
In running from the Race point to Wood
Endâafter you pass 1 the Black Land or Hum
mucks, you will come tip with a low faÂ»dy
beach, which forms the harbor j extending be
tween a and 3 miies to Wood-end, which it
difficult diftinguilhed in the nightâlt is
boldâyou will have aj fathom water
within half a mile of the ihore.
In beating into Cape-Cod harbor, you must
keep the eastern ihore aboard, until you get in
to 5 fatho/n water. Stand no farther to the
westward than to hring the light to bear E by S
at there is along spit of sand runs off from the
western ihorr, which being very bold, you will
have 11 fatHom water within a ftonce throw of
ihore.
IÂ« cafe it blows so hard that you cannot beat
the harbor, you will have good anchoring
without, from 10 to 15 fathom water.
YeflVls in Boflon bay and would wifli to put
away for Cane Cod harbor, must endeavor to
falLjn with the Race. If in the night, and you
eannotfee the land, you must bring the Light
to bear E by N and *un for it until yon have
fnundiqjts in 14 or 15 fathom water, then fleer
north east until the Might, bears E by S then .-un
in Iff W for the harbftr.
v At full and change, it is high water off Race
Point at 10 o > cl9ck and 43 minutes. Veffeli in
leaving Cape Cod bound to Boflon, ihould cal
culate the tide, as the flosd sets flrong to the
south well,
