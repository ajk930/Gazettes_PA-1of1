FOREIGN INTERCOURSE.
WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY Z9.
Mr.CoiT said, that he had' been furpriz
cd at the length of the present discussion ;
hut fat's surprize abated, when he recoll*Â£ted
that it li:?d been enftomary for gcntlemcn at
every fefiion to go into a philippic against
the Executive and executive measures. The
usual occasion had been the answer to the
President's speech; but as that this session
had gone off fnaoathly, without any thing
of this kind, it seemed as if the present mo
tion had heen intended for the purpose.
Id the course of the present debate, both
the bill and the amendment had almost been
loft fight of. Indeed, so foreign had the de
bate been from the fubjefl, that he had
thought of moving to have had the speech
of the gentleman from Virginia printed and
laid upon the table, as that seemed tp have
been the firbjeft of discussion Mr. C. said
he vviftild rmke a few observations on the bill
â¢nd the proposed amendment, and then take
some notice of what appeared to be foreign
to the fubjedV.
This bill,. Mr. C. said, was in the fame
flyle as the former law; the f?(3ion to whieh
the amendment was offered, was exactly in
the fame words. The amendment proposed
ministers at London and Paris should have
the fame salary as heretofore, and that all
others should not have more than half the
sum. Perhaps the style and expences of liv
ing might be lower at other coutts; if so,
it ought to have been so slated, but nothing
had been said on this The style of
the bill was of a kind which he did not ap
prove. It was deferable that the salaries of
all officers should be fixed by law; but as
when this law passed, it was not known t
what would be a proper diftindion to make i
in the salaries of ministers to different places, â 
it was left to the discretion of the President, j
limiting him as to the extent. It was un- j
pleasant to the President to allow alefs sum ;
to one minirter than he allowed to another ; i
and the consequence had been that all had
been allowed the highest sum allowed by law; j
but as he supposed the fame reafoos existed
which caused the law to be passed in this ;
wajy at firft, he saw no reason for altwing
it. V j
Thtre conld be no doubt as to the pow
er ot the house to fix the salaries of minif
tein; and if there wÂ«-re lufficient rcafoss why
the ministers at PanVand London have larg
er salaries than ihoft at other courts, no
donftitutional qtiellipn could arise 3s to the
power <>{ the house to come to such a deci
Â£o.n,
P.Â»t the gentleman from Virginia seemed
'to have an olifctt which was not the oflenfi- 1
ble one, as he fnpported his .imcndmeut, by '
argument* perftttly inapplicable to it. Tin
objeft seemed to be, to ptevtnt the fending 1
rf ministers of a certain grade, to any but 1
the <soiivts os-London and Paris. Granting '
that the house had the power of dettrmrn- '
ing this question, they would not do it with' 1
out information. The gentleman from Vir
ginia, the gentleman from Tennessee, and '
o 'ntrs fay that we have no need of a minis- 1
ti â¢ " Berlin. What authority tfae-y had for 1
the a union he knew ;he supposed the
President had more complete knowledge on 1
the fu'. jeÂ£t than they, and he has said the '
contrary by the appointment. It was, in
deed, idle to speak upon a fubjeft on which '
they neither had, nor could have fufisient :
information 1
It, appeared to him that the gentleman 1
frrm Virginia had not attended to : materi- 1
al part of theConfcitution. Much had been I
fa d about the check which one department
â of government had over another; but there
â¢was one consideration not attended to. By '
the constitution, it appeared that the feverai 1
departments originated from the fame fotirce â
they were all equally the agents of the 1
people. One department had a right to Â°
challenge the fame confidence from their .
eoirftituents as the otherâno one had the j'
excliifive confidence of the people. And if j'
there was not a mutual confidence betwixt
the different branches of government, no-
thing but wrangling and disorder would be
the consequence. *
If the President of the United States was r<
possessed of patronage, that hoife did'not &
give it to him, nor could they take it away. "
Whether thepeople had given him too much
or too little, was no question before them. u
As to the discretion of appointing to office ' e
it was a delicate fubjfc&, aud he wished it !)
had not been touched; but, as it had been
handled, and talked about, it might as well h
be talked about freely. He had been so m
unaccustomed to any thing like a political ' 1:
creed, that he had never thought any was a
doptedby the Executive. But he foundit was
too true that certain opinions were held in
this country, which made it necessary fer m
the President to eflquir* into the opinious of
persons who were to take part in the cxecu- w
tion ef government. Certain opinions had ci
been brotched as held by many perfuns of Â°'
this country} he did not knew, however,i w
that they were held by any. He would ftatc
what the opinions were to which he alluded.
Mr. C. then read the folic wing extract lt
[which it will be recollefi*d, is from a let
ter said to be written by a person high in of. g<
sice in this government to Mr. Mazzci, at m
Madrid.]
" That our political fituatinn is prodigi- b
â¢ ufly changed Jtnce a fen, years pafiâTkat rr
infttad of that noble love of liberty, and that it
republican government, which carried us b
through the dangers of the war, an Anglo, m
Monarchic, ariltocralic party has ariftn ol
their avowed objeft being to impose upon us h
tbe substance, as they havu already given us p!
the form of the British government : That ti
nererthtjefs the principal body of our citi ai
atns remain faithful to republican principles* h
our proprietors of lands Lang friendly to tl
f'iofe principles, as also the mal's of men of
taUnti. n
â¢ That the rejfjtlicttni in the United Stater
' have against them, the Exesutive and judt
! cial powerâall the officers of government,
S. all w ho are seeking officesâall timid men,
who prefer the calm of defpotrfm to the tem
pestuous feÂ» of LibÂ«,rtyâthe British mer
chants, and the Americans, who trade on
British capitalsâthe fpeeulators -persons
z ' ' intercfled in the ban* and the public funds.
That these establishments mere invented
with views of corruption, and to aflimilate
" . as to the British model in its eorrtipt parts.
j That it would give arihonej} man * fever to
1C hear of the apostates who have embraced
le these heretics '.âThat they are men who were
n Solomons in council and Sampsons in com
bat, but whose haif has been cut off by the
whore of England.
7 hat these men wifbed to wrest from tbi peo
ple of America that liberty which thsy have
n obtained by so much labor and . peril; but
' that the repuklicatit would preserve it.
That the mafsof weight and riches in the
j republicant is so powerful, that they have no
thing to fear from any attempt against them
, by force.
.. J That it is fufficient that they guard then
, fe/vei, and"that they break the Lilliputian
e ties by which these eqnfpiraton have bou.nd
n them ill the firft slumbers which fucceedtd
their labors. '
That in Jhort it it fujjicieat that, the republi
can.t arrefl the progress of that system of in
j gratitride and injnftice towards France,
which these confpiraten have been DMtluirig,
j with a view to alienate the people of America
from France, and to bring them under Bri
tish influence."
Far be it from me, said Mr. C. to charge
' fentimentsof this kind to any gentleman of
f th
is house ; he had hoped there had been j
none such in Atnerica. But evidence
P was too ttrong that a fort of political en
thusiasm existed which seemed to take to
itfelf excliifive republicam'fm ; wVich em
braced sentiments too much like those which
[he had cited. He would ask the gentle
' ; man from Virginia, whether, if the Prefi- i
' dentcf the United States supposed there
' "ere persons who entertained sentiments |
| like these, he ought to appoint such per- ,
ions to office ? That gentleman must can- j
didly answer No.â It would argue extreme j
fol'y to do so, as nothing but treason and |
infurre&ion would be the confeqiitnee of t
such epinions. For, if the present gev ,
; ernmcnt be holtile to the interests of the j
i country, and be planning away its liberties, t
it would ccu&ioly be the duty of every hon- .
eft citizen to use his efforts to destroy it. j
He hoped, however, these sentiments were
not harbored !*y any ; he should have plea- '
sure in hearing the gentleman from Virgin- ;
ia disavow them. But certainly if the Pre- ]
fident of the United States believed that t
fitch sentiments were held, he, was fully jufl
ified in determining not to appoint to office r
persons Koldiug them. '
Mr. S. Smith rose to move an amend- (,
merit to the amendment Â©f the gentleman jj
from Vilginia, which he hoped he would v
consent to, viz. to add a> a place a
to which miriifters sent should have a salary
us 9,000 duilarv. : *
[Mr. Nicholas was not in his place, and t
therefore could not consent to this amend- e
mert. It of course became the fubjtft of f,
debate.]
Mr. J. Williams supposed gentlemen q
opposed to the original amendment, would c
also be oppofe(l to this. ;* t
Mr. Harper fajd there not be a 0
more nugatory amendment than this. No- a
body would objeft, he supposed, to a min
ister plfnipotentiÂ»y for Spain ; but it was t ]
to the interfering in the business at all that" t ,
the objttiionlay, as it went to abridge the t |
power of the Prcfidynt.
Mr. S. Smith said the amendment which t(
he had proposed, was a simple amendment t(
to the bill, without having any reference to p
the right of the President. I
Mr. LtviNGSTON said the gentleman f r
trom S. Caroling, had forgotten the objedt ;
| of his colleague (Mr. Pinckney) who had
said he wiftied to get rid of ourfareign min
isters as soon as poflible, and his great ob- (,
je&ion to tne present amendment was, that n ,
by it the mim'fter plenipotentiary was with- t(
drawn from Spain.
the amendment of tire gentleman from
Maryland was carried, therefore, it would \ y
remove ,that objeftion ; and the vote of that f,,
gentleman in favor of the prspofed reduc
tiori. would be of considerable cpnfequence. f u
Mr. Rutlidoe said the gentleman last j n
up had mis-dated the sentiments of his col- gl
league. His colleague had, for some time,
been too much indisposed ta attend his dn
ty in the ho' fe ; but be had told him that a ,
his sentiments on this fubje& had been much w
mifrcprefented. He believed his colleague
had said, that, in orderly times, it would f p
be well to lessen ovir foreign cpmicciionsâ e â
not that he would do so. at. all events ; and - w
in order to shew the impropriety of the a- jr,
mendment of the gentleman from Virginia, et ]
he instanced Spain, with whom, he said it ; B ,
was probable negociations might now be 1
carrying on, and that .therefore to recall .w
our minrSer from thence might be attended i: e
with bad consequences.
Mr. LmiiGSTON replied he had under- r_
lood Mr. Pinckney to fay what he had sta
ted. P c
.. ' mi
Mr. Dayton (thefpeaker) said, if the cu
geHtleraan from Maryland h*d offered an a- tie
mendment to the speech, firft or second of fts
the gentleman from Virginia, it might have gi
been proper, as he thought them liable to a- fir
mendment m many parts. As to the bill gc
itfelf, or the amendment, they had long Rl
been wit of fight. It was not the letter of
"t the amendment, but its spirit th?t was ex
objetted to ; but if he was to decide at s&l, 01
he would cn-tainly dispense with this com- w;
p.imentary interference with the nation men- in
tinned fconerthan with any other; but if efl
any new amendment was brought forward,
he hoped it would be to the speech, and not la
tne bill. â w
Mr. Otis was opposed to this amend- 01

,s mendment to his motian, if it would ac

e The amendment was of eourfe admitted.
I. Mr. S. SMITH said, he understood the
0 gentleman from S.Carolina (Mr. Pinekney)
as fayiiig. that in time of profound peace,
e it would be proper to withdraw all our
foreign intercourse, as it could do little good,
e and might do much harm. If he was of the
fame" opipion with that gentleman that there
would ever-be au inclination in fhis govern
e mcnt to do a way all bur foreign intercourse
1 he fWuld no'i fee cfcfirous of carrying this
amendment ; but as this was not the cafe,
' e he wished to put the business upon a stable
foundation, by fixing the salaries of our
" ministers, as was the cafe it the governments
of Europe. The L Prefident had 40,000 dol
" lari appropriated for foreign intercourse,
1 leaving to him to give ministers what he
| pleafcd, so that it did not exceed the sums
* fpeeified in the aiS. 'J'he confcquence was,
that, though the expence and style of living
" was very different ip different countries, he
â  allowed to all the highett sum. He wished
> therefore, that at the courts of London,
â¢ Paris and Madrid, our ministers fhoald re
-1 ceive filch an allowance' as sHould enable
" them to live in the style which was necessary
there ; but he believed a much lets allowance
; would be fufficient at the courts of Berlin
and Lisbon. He believed one half the sum
1 would there be fufficient. A regulation of
: this kind would relieve the President from
his present fituatioa, in which be found it
' unpleasant to make any discrimination be
â  twixt minifteri sent tt different countries,
1 If the prefeni difcuffian had been confined
to the law the question might have
been determined long ftnee ; but the gen
tleman from Virginia had introduced other
' fubjeits, and it iad been found necessary to
reply to thefflÂ« His colfeague (Mr. Graik)
said that gefttlein en might fay they were
fpcaking to the galleries, or not, he main
. tnined they all spoke to the public, and
that the public would determine whose fea
timeota were right. His colleague was,
however, mistaken in one thing, viz. that
the executive had a right to make treaties
and appoint ministers, and that that house ,
had no right to toufiderthc propriety of ap- 'â 
propriating for them ; and in faying that ;
this question had been decided several times !
in this way, particularly in the ease of the I
British treaty and the frigates. He had to- I
ted for both these measures ; but he never
believed that the executive could appoint as
many ministers, or negociate as many trea
ties, as he pleased, and that that house would
be bound to carry them into effeA. He
knew he had a right to do both ; but if he
west to au exccfs in either, that house had
right to ckeek him by withholding ap
propriations, and would do it. There had
..
trary, but there - had been several votes to
eftablilh the principle which he contended
for. Upon the call for papers in the discus
sion on the British treaty, which was a
question involving the right of the house to
enquire into the propriety of the measure,
the question was carried 62 to 37. But in
order that this might not be mistaken here
after, the house came to another rcfolution, .
it) which it was expressly stated, that though
tbÂ« house claimed no agency in making of
treaties, that they had a right so judge of 1
the expediency orinexperliency of carrying 1
them into effeit, which was carried by 57
to 35. And when the treaty itfelf was de- 1
termined to be carried into effect, it was ex- 1
prefsly upon the expediency of the measure. I
If gentlemen were not fatisfied of this right I
from the constitution, he trusted they Would I
allow that these votes had put the matter 1
beyond doubt. s
Thus much to shew that his colleague 1
had been mistaken on this point. Gentle- t
men, Mr. S said, were sent to that house
to do their duty ; and it was not to be sup- f
posed, hecaufe they had the power of Jlop- ]
ping the wheels of government, that the.y c
would do so ; for, however they might dif- 1
;er in opinion cm the ftihjeCks which came c
before them, they would certainly agree in i r
fupporti'ng the government. Indeed no i
injtance could be adduced, in which this dif. t
eretionary power had beenabufed. 1;
His colleague had fa.d that party did ex- a
ill both in that house, and Out of it. He h
agreed with him 5 said it was right, ' v
when a man went with a party to avow it. j t
Gentlemen had complained that members ' c
spoke to the galleries and to their conftitu-i d
Cnts, and not to the members within those 1;
walls ; vet they themselves did the fame.â a
For what else, he asked, could be intend- p
ed when gentlemen charged others with be- 1 r<
ing dforganizcts and with intentions of o- g
â vertuming the government ? When they said S
this, tbey did not believe it ; bu| they be- 1 w
lieved it would pleaie their coniftituents to ' tl
hear that they had thus (aid. But could it I
for a moment be credited, that men of pro- e:
perty would come there to fst the govern- u
ment afloat, and by that means render infe- w
cure property of every kind ? These reflec- c<
tions were meaut to apply to the southern ai
A?tes, an-d he believed particularly to Vir- ci
ginia ; but let gentlemen fliew one infurrec- 'P
tion or violent Oppolition to any measure of n
government in that quarter. They could =
not do it ; for tho' the people in the state
of Virginia were general.y opposed to the
excise law, yet, when it had passed, the
oppoCtian ceafcd; and he believed there f,
was not a state in the union, besides thai,
in which that law was honeHly carried into
effedl. _
When the infurre&ion against the excise
law took placeln this state, the citizens of
which quarter of the United States turned /
out more readily than these of the state of K
V irginia, armed and accoutred by that state 01
e to quell the disorder ? Vet they were calle
a dif organiser s. He himfelf was not arraii
it of these refleflionsâthey never touche
d him; but he thought they were dilhonour
able to tiff Legislature of the Union,
e Gentlemen were in the habit of fpeakinj
1- to the galleries, of imported df Srines, refer
ring to a gentleman in that honfe. whose a
- bjlities they feared. What could they meai
by such inlinuations, if not to please theii
I. constituents ?He himfelf had thought, that
e though a.man was not a native of this coun
try, if he went through the revolution, ht
was an American as much as a native, a,s ht
r was one from the commencement of our in
dependence ; and before that time, the)
p were all British fubje&s. 8.-fides this ar
e gument cuts both ways, as there were gen
tlemen in the house of this description of
c very different opinions.
s Mr. S. believed heretofore, that all the
citizens of the United States, were equally
' e entitled to the favours of the Executive.
r He had believed that uo refped had been
s paid to men of any particular opinion ; but
they had now been told, both out of doors
and in that house, that all persons who did
not think precifcly with thi executive were
~ to be exchided from office. If this was a
faft, the patronage consequent tpon ap
r pomtments to office, might be improperly
| applied. He hoped this was not so, and
I that the President was better informed with
refpedt to his duty, and could not believe
| what gentlemen had so confidently asserted
. as he saw men in office who had always been
, friends of the federal government, as well
. as those who opposed its adoption.
Mr. S. concluded by faying, tftat gentle
men were fond of calling themselves the sup
- porters of government, but he wished them
to be convinced thtt men who differed from
them in opinion, were equally its friends
aÂ«d supporters with them.

TUlSDAYâmarch 6.
The bill fffiividing the means of inter
course with' foreign natiou3, was read the
third time and pafTc;(3.
The Speakh laid before the house a
communication from the fecretacy of the
treasury, inclosing a statement of the .ex

Mr. D. Foster made a report on the
petition of joftua Kellett, who prayed for
j compenfatioti on account of a certificate
j which was loft. They report, if the fa&

i afterwards withdrawn.
I Mr. Recd presented a petition fro* l '***'
izens of Bridgwater- "Wiallachufetts,
praying an alteration ia the poll roads,
which was referred to the committee on

Mr. Livi ngston moved the order of 1
the day on the bill fupplementsiry to the aft

and Conneftieut, allowing a jury to be ta

the fubjeifi was postponed for 3 week.
.A nother message was received fr.om the
senate, informing the house that they Lad
passed the bill for erefting a light-bouse and
certain buoys ; and also the bill far the re
lief of the widows and orphans of certain
deceased officers and soldiers, botfi with a-

Mr. Harper then called for the order of
the day on the bill supplementary to the aÂ£t
laying a duty on (tamped vellum, parchment
and paper ; which being consented to, the

' whole on the fubjedt ; when it was agreed

dollars, and also to repeal, that part of the
law which imposes a duty upon debentures,
and to enaft in its plaee, that one quarter

S. Smith to exclude Â«11 antes payable at or

the dutv to all bills of lading to ten cents.
It was also proposed by Mr. J. Williams to
exclude from duty all bonds bills or notes

CITIZENS,
YOU are at this moment placed under
new circumstances: Your Republican sen
timents, and your patriotic efforts mutt take
aniithe* eourfe.
Of all tlie,coalefced powers against the li
berty of France, England is the only re
maining one with whom we have to fight.
She is our eternal enemy; we are preparing
a great expedition against her. The wishes
of the whole nation call loudly for this ar
mament. It is neccfl'ary that every person
employed by the gov.rmnent should now fe'.
eond the views and labours of the Directo
ry. All parties should join in that great
objeftâWar tvith F.nglaad.
In this great undertaking, yon cannot,
yf>u ought not to remain inaftive ; you
'should, 011 the contrary, take an aitive and
decisive part in this euterprizc. You well
know that the diplomatic powtr, which is
terrible in the hand, of the British minister,
baÂ» for a long bee.i in a languishing
way ill ours. The Executive Diredtory are
mxious so give this department of govern
ment its futleft lustre and vigour. The
(eace concluded at Campo Formio, may be
onfidered as the dawn, and the Congress
t Ralladt will complete this defirablg ob
iS; you mult join in forwarding it.
You have, Citizens, without douht, each
you, formed a just idea of the greatness
, d force of the French Republic;âforeign
â¢ know it, and it is needles* to recal to
ur minds that you represent the firft peo-
J if) Europe, a natiofl composed of 30
ilions of inhabitants, and whom aothing
Â«the continent eould refill.
{â low then is it possible that England, a
mtan , anf j st r ength
en in the time of monarchyâjÂ° - t
jfible, I fay, that she has conftantjyoppo^
4, and even humiliated France? in
frr situation, and the idea of liberty, of
tich she vainly boasts, are not the only
jfons which hare given her thole advanta
s; it has been principally by the *ffeÂ£t of
at diplomatic system which she follows:
it thfe strength is like the reft, it is easy
â¢ conquer. Let us only look at their hifto
, frnce they firft meddled with the affairs
â¢ Europe. '--Tâ.-râ¢ ... ; . ' iy-

hich he was aided by the powerful pen by
ie celebrated Milton. He spoke t<Â» all
he cabinets of Eufope in a language of fe
;rity; aivd ever ft ace that period the court
f St. James has held the fame language,
lat language which at firft was nothing but
iie insolence of a fortunste usurper, has be

le calling themselves free. Engaged in
long series of war*, during the reign of,
,ouis XIV., the otlvr powtTS of Europe
lought her extremely powerful, becaufc
ie called her ft If soâThey fuffored them
lives to be astonished, and gave rtp, with
ut examination, 10 the pretensions of a
aurt which aÂ£ted by threats. Soon after,
VarÂ«ce, delivered up by a dull Prince, to a
t of corrupted Ministers, weakened by
felefs victories, and by alliances contrary
i her real interefls, reduced to the mrtll
tplorable state, France saw herfelf degra
Â»d to the fhameful neeeffity of trembling
,'fore the court of London. Strong in

It is this power, Citizens, which we must
rftrey; it is this Colossus which must be o
rturned.
It is absolutely necessary, Citizens, that
iu, en your fide, should attack with eou- '
ge the federative power of Britain, while, 1
on purs, will launch our armies on 1
eir territories, and expose to the eyes of '
onifhed Europe, the true secret of her
*ikaefs. I}i this view, the following are
t steps which you must follow: <
Let your conduit be in direct opposition
that of the envoys from the cabinet of I
tndon; hold faft to this rule, and do not <

All their a&ions, all their views, (

re dependant, and by an excess of am- 1
on, which disgraces humanity, forbids i
m, irider pain of death, to fbw, plant, r
ivate ir trade, or in fadt to do any thing I
whicl.often makes them meet with uui- I

. too ignorant of commerce and the arts ; she
: thought of nothing but the glory of con

offers nothing which can be put on a paral

" people of all nations should join ut> in }-* y

e Anfwcr, citizens, answer with dignity to
the anguft duties of vour miflion; let the
pen and the voice of the French negociators

t The more the agents of England are im

Watch all their movements ; hinder them

able and' sage representationsâyen will be

yeu. Often will you be obliged to use the
firm and decisive language of republicans to
the ministers of foreign courts ; let it be
forcible ; you wilt find in trie a supporter in
every tbing you can do agsinft the infernal
genius of the cabinet of London. Let U3
daily know your operationsâyour intelli

With regard to what concerns you,
personally, endeavour to love, esteem and
refpeA each nther. Do not infringe the laws

rnufl pay attention to republican manners
and cuftems. To the acknowledgement of
a trifling etiquette, join that political
franknefs and uwkj
has to the foul of virtue and senti
ment. Be careful to avoid a fault too com
mon in our days ; I mean that irascible and
noisy energy, which, in a diplomatic cha
racter, never can be regarded as a happy
quality. Measure all your steps, ind do net

argument.
I propose, citissens,to communicate more
regularly andfreqi. # tly than formerly, those

The objeft of this circular letter is to form,
between all the diplomatic agents ef the
Frern h republic,an a&iveand zealous league
against the lafl enemy we have to con
quer, and thus accomplish the wishes of the
Directory. Make known to the whole
world, how little the Englifii government
is worthy of confidence. Such "is at this
time, your principal business. Negleft no
thing to obtain this grand ohjeft. You will
find, no doubt, numbcrlcfs difficulties which
must be overcome. Do not give wayâTo
do away all obstacles, count on the army of
EnglandâOur country has its eyes on you.
In conforming yourfsves to the (piritof this
circular, you will find a sure support in the
union and wisdom of the Executive Direct
ory, and in the good services of the mini*
fter who writes this by order of <he Direct
ory.
