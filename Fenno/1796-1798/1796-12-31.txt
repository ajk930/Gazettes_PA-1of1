blithing a national univetflty. It had been said
that the President had taken nie opportunity of
recommending this meafme, as it was the last time
he would have toaddrefs them â-This recommenda
tion, Mr. C. said, was another proof, in his opi
nion, of the wifdfrin of that man. But, added
he, neither the speech of the President, nor the
memorial of the commissioners after t fie report. He
thought the commiflioners seemed to have- antici
pated the obje&ions which would be made to a na
tional university. They had had the fame ideas
which he entertained of the eligibility of such an
institution ; but, forefeeing that the plan would be
obje&ed to, they relinquiflied that idea, and request
only an incorporation for th& purpol'e of receiving
donations. They did not, he said, call upon this
house to put their hand in the public treasury on
their account. He thought tbe commiflioners were
entitled to some credit for this forcfight. They
called merely for an aft, which no other power
could grant them (as had been (hewn by his col
league Mr* Sprigg) to enable them to receive what
might be given to them for this institutionâto re
fufe which was an aft of the highest injustice, since
it was a requelt which they would have had no dif
ficulty in obtaining from the ftatc government,before
the ceflion of the territory of the United States.
â¢ Truly lamentable, 1Â«.- said, would be the situation
of the people of that Jilt rift, if they were to be
thus treated.
Nothing could be more extraordinary, Mr. C.
said, than the do&rine aflerted by gentlemen who
opposed this meafuie, viz. that if the house en
tered at all into the business, they would be oblig
ed to go through with it. As well raigh. it be
said, when Congress removes to that diftrift, if
they are applied to for a law to build a bridge, or
make a road, they will'bind tbemfelves to go thro'
with the expence. The two cases, he said, were
perteftly similar: and if the people who were fet
tled there could not receive vhe privileges to whieh
other citizens were entitled they might be looked
upon as outcatts of society.
The objeftious of gentlemen, Mr. C. (aid, did
not go-so much against the expediency of the mea
sure, and the conveniency of tbe people who ask
for the iullitution, as against the danger of legif
latiog at all in this buiinefs- He would again fay,
he was surprised to hear the opposition come from
the quarter whence it did come ; for he would fay,
there was a great want of public femi'naries in that
country. Was there any man, heafked, who took
a view on the south fide of the Potomac, and con
sidered the probable incrcafe of population which
was likely to take place there, who would not fay
that such an institution was a defiratile objedt ?
Or that would fay that the period of that popula
tion ought to be waited for before luch an institu
tion was set about ? It was his opinion that such
objects (hould grow up with the growth of a fet
tlemeal, and strengthen with its lirength. Tho*
furh a seminary could not be eftablifhtd now as
might be rftabliflied fifty years hence, should they
refufe the power to persons to receive donations
for the ereftian of such an one as they could find
refourccs to complete ? If there were ftiong claims
for this interpolition, they had nothing to do with
the funds which were to carry the fcl.eme into et
feft. It was well known there was a fund in the
hands of the President of the United States, which
he wilhed to have employed in fome'hing of this
kind, and he wondered gentlemen from that quar
ter (hould be opposed to its having an opportunity
of being employed in this diftiiA.
If gentlemen did uot wi(h the growth and im-
I provement of the diftridt which they have taken
, under their direction, and wouW fay so, he should
not be at a loss to account for their cor.dust. If
they were determined to (hew the people of this
diÃrift, that they were Jeiit-d common justice,
I every man would avoid thisfjut, as enjoying fewer
privileges than any other.
He hoped, therefore, that when it was seen that
the report did not contain more than appeared on
the face of ft, nor than would be granted to any
other part of the union, that the oppofitiojj which
had been raised against it would be withdrawn. He
hoped the fubjeft would be permitted, therefore, to
lie over for further confideratioa.
It was moved that the business should lie ever
until the second Monday in January.
Mr. Sprigg wished the report to be re-commit
ted.
Mr. Coit was against a poftponerntntâThe fub
je&, he said, had undergone considerable discussi
on, and he doubted not the house was as ripe tor
a decision then as they would be hereaftfr. To
polipone was to protract the dispatch of business,
and consumed double and treble the time that would
otherwise be occupied on any fubjeft.
Mr. Harper hoped the postponement would take
place, because it would give gentlemen an oppor
tunity of putting the business into such a form as
to be more acceptable to the house. the
principal objection made to the report was founded
on an apprehension that the house would be impli
cated in future expense by agreeing to if, if some
method of introducing the fnhjeft could be hit up
on, which could obviate that objection, it via* de
ferable it should be done. He thefeforo wiflied
gentlemen to have time to do this.
Mr Nicholas thought it unnectfiary to postpone
the buiinefs. The objection in his mind did not
atile from any implied promise, but from the in-
Rant that Wife gave the authorl: y aflctd for, In
believed they should be considered as haying given
a fanftion to the piaceeding ; and then confiitency
of conduct, dignity of govcriitnenc, and other cob
fidetations, would oblige them to fuppert the in
stitution. Any determination now made to the
contrary, he said, would avail nothing. If the
bulinefs was entered upon at all, it would end in a
national university.
Mr. Nicholas denied that he had any intention
of disregarding the wifbe* of the peoplte of that
diftrift. If an opinion of that furt went forth,
the gentleman (Mr. Craik) must attribute it to
himfelf. When he was up yesterday, he had said,
that when the people of that diftrift wanted a pub
lic seminary, he would be ready to afford them eve
ry afiiftancc. Bot, said your officers, and they
alone, are the projeftwis of this bulinefs. Men
who went there to execute public bttfinefs. Was
refilling their request, then, Tefufmg the request of
the people of that diftrift ? He thought not. He
thought it had been Veil, therefoie, if these ex
pressions had been spared. He never 'either made
or felt them.
Mr. Nicholas asked with what view donations
would be given to this institution ?âWould it be
for a seminary of learning for a diftrift <of country
ten miles square i He believed not ; but that every
donation made to this institution, would be made tÂ«
it as a national university. If gentlemen viewed it
in any other light, they were deceiving the public.)
He hoped, therefore, they fhouid negative the pre
fect question, and disagree to the report of the fe
left committee.
Mr. Brent said, he was at a loss to know how
gentlemen cduld raise the objections which they had
made to the report in question. He was sure they
could not arise from the report itfelf. This did
not reeognife the university as a national univeTfity.
The matter appeared to b>m to be fiKiply this, that
several individuals in the federal city, who were
greatly intcrefted in its prosperity, were of opinio)*,
than an institution of this kind would not only ad
vance the interests of the city, but be a mean of
difieminating learning ; tbey had therefore prayed
an incorporation for the purpose. Why his col
league should call this a national utiiverfity, and
that by a mere aft of incorporation, they should
pledge themselves to fapport it, was to him afton
ilhing and incomprehensible. If any particular
body of men fhoald apply for an aft of incorpora
jion, by granting it, should they pledge themselves
to carry their fiheme into effect ? The thing was
too unreasonable to be supposed.
Mr B. said, if he was of opinion that the in
coiporatinjjr persons to leceive donations for this
university would oblige their to fofter this establish
ment, he should be one of the firft to object to it.
He should object to it en eonftitutional principles ;
because, whatever had been the praftiae of that
house, he was of opinion, that imposing a revenue
for fuel) a purpose, would be unconstitutional, and
arrogating a right which they did not pofTets.
Under the afpeft which the fubjeft Ipefore them
bore, he trusted all objections to it would be with
drawn. A 'free government, he said, had its
foundations in wisdom, and the legislature of such
a government ought to encovirage every institution
which tended to infoim and enlighten the peopleâ
a contrary procedure were to ftifle knowledge, and
introduce barbarism.
Thc speaker reminded the house. that the ques
tion of pÂ»ftponement was before them.
Mr. Swanw'ick was against a postponement, be
cause he thought the question could as well be de
cided then as at a future day. As the application
now itood, he was ready to give it his negative, be.
cause he did not think it was proper tojallow any
charter to the commiffioncts. He should therefore
vote against the report. HÂ» should have wifti
ed to have made some further observations on the
fubjeft ; but in this flagc of the business, he wras
doubiful whether they jvould be in oider, and there
fore he should withhold them.,
Mr. Giles was in favour of a poftpooement, nnt
that he wanted time to consider the fubjeftâHe
was ready to vote against it, but because the advo
cate* of the meafuie wilhed it. He himlclf was
opposed to all kiuda of corporations ; but he did
think the prcfeni fubjeft had not berfn fully discussed,
& wished more time to be allowed for gentlemen to
bring forward the queltion in any other way which
they might think would be more acceptable to the
house.
Mr. Vcnable said he was opposed to a poflponement.
it had been repeatedly laid that there was nothing a
larming or under cover in this report.âFor his part,
he believed it to be connected with t National Uui
verfity, and that it was introduced in this fliape be
cause it was apprehended it would not pass if brought
into the House without disguise-
Mr. V. wished the bufincft not to be postponed, be
cause the Maryland legislature was then tkiiS'g, and
Jhe commiflioners nightapply to it and get their bufi
nels done ; for whatever might have been said to, the
contrary, he believed they could as well incorporate
them, as foreigners to hold lands, a navigation compa
ny, Columbian bank company, Jtc. and if they could
do this, he believed it would not be said, that when the
federal government took peffeffion of that diflriil that
corporation wouldnotbe valid. If a local seminary
was only intended, he thoaght this the best way of pro
ceeding.
Mr. Craik believed the period for which the idl
.was pal Ted which had been mentioned, would expire
before the year 1800.
Mr. Murray said, it weuld be no indulgence to the
friends of the present measure to dispose of the busi
ness then, that tuey might apply to the Maryland Le
gislature ; because he believed t hat Legislature was now
riien. He hoped the House would therefore agree to
a poftpoaement.
The question for a poflponement was put and car
ried 37 to 36.
Mr. W. Smith moved to call up the resolution he
ytftcrJaylaid 011 the table refpefting an allowance to
the fufferers by the late fire at Savann-ah ; when, on
the fenle of the house being taken whether it should be
taken into eonfideration or not, there appeared only 16
votes in favour of it.
Mr. W. Smith gave notice he should to morrow
again move to have it taken into consideration.
The house went into a committee of the whole on
the bill for relief of John Seats, which was agreed to
wirhout amendment, taken up in the house, read a
second time, and ordered to be engrofled for a third
reading to-morrow.
Mr. D. Foster moved that the report of the Com
mittee of claims on the petition ef Willam Parsons be
committed to a Committed of the woole. Agreed and
made the order tor to morrow. Adjourned.
Wednesday, December 28.
Mr. W. Smith wifked the house to resolve itfclf
into a committee of the whole on the Tefolution,
which he had the other 1 day laid upon the tablr,
proposing to afford fame relief to the (ufferets l.y
the late fin at Savannah. FOl his part, he said,
he could fee no reasonable objection which could be
made to so benevolent a proportion. A gentleman
in the house had got a plan of the ruins of the ci
ty, it waÂ§ indeed a Hull diftrefsful scene. There
had never occurred so calamitouÂ» an event of the
kind in the United States, or which had so strong
a claim upon the general government for relief. He
said they had granted allirtance to the fuflerers by
fire at St. Domingo ; and surely if it were juttitia
ble to grant relief to foreigners in diltrefs, it was
at lead equally so when the objects were our own
citizens. If gentlemen had objeiSions to the mea
sure he wished they would state them. 1 lie fjiw
with which he ftiould think of filliug up tjhe blank,
would not be fueh as to materially affett oar finan
ces.
Mr. Milledge said, if the unfortunate had any
claim upon gove'rnment for relief, none could have
greater than the citizens of Savannah. Few hou
ses, he said, were remaining of that city, and
-thofc few were the leafl valuable. Not a public
building ; not a place of public woilhip, or of
( public justice ; all was a wide watte of tuin and
desolation, such as scarcely could be conceived, and
fiich as it were impoflible to describe. He hoped
some relief would be tfiordsd to distress so uuexaaj
pie#.
Mr. Cooper said, it was a very unpleasant thisg
to come forward to oppose a measure oi this foil ;
but when they looked into different parts of the
union and saw the loffcs which had been fattained at
New-York, Chariefton, &c. it would appear only
reasonable, that if Yclicf was ifforded in,one cafe,
it ought to Tie extended to another ; and if this re
fclution were agreed to, he fliould cfcrtainly move
to have some relief afforded to New-York. He
hoped, however, the business would Â»iot be pro
ceeded with. If the principle were a good one,
it would bear going thiough with ; but it would
te seen, this would, on the contrary, pmve a dsn
geroiis-one. What they did to day, lie f..'dÂ» would
require repeating to sionow. If they were to 1* ke
good losses by hrÂ«, there would be no occasion for
| Insurance Companies, nor any inducement tÂ» fitiild
with brick in preference to wood. Hcfcll as muck
as others for the distresses of tbe people of Ssvan
nah, but was of opinion it was not a proper buSÂ»
nefsfor the interference of that house.
Mr. W. Smith thought with the gentleman froÂ«Â»
New-Y.ork, that they ought to attend to the ptin.
ciples upon which they acted, and not do a thing-,
to-day which they ought not do to-morrow. He
trusted the house would not beoften called upon to
relieve a calamity like the present ; nor need they
be alarmed at the gentleman's intention of bringing
fciward New-York for relief. Charlellon, he said,
had experienced great distress by fire, yet he had
not moved that house for any relief. The quelHon
was, whether this was not a peculiar cate of dis
tress ; and if so, whether they had not the power
of affording relief ? And as to this being brought
forward as a precedent, it was as he
hoped they fiiouid net again fooo hear of four,
fifths of a whale city being burnt so ashes; but if
such an inltance should occur, he should vote for
affording the fufferers relief. He thought the
jeftiuns did not apply.
On the quethon being taken whether the house
would then refolvc itfelf into a committee of the
whole on the fubjeft, therfc appaaied 38 for it, and
39 against it.
A (notion was then made to discharge the com
mittee of the whole from any farther confideralioo
of the subject.
Mr. W. L> man hoped the business would not be
disposed of without going into a committee of the
whole. Ke thought more refpedi*6vas due to the
feelings of the fufferers than to dispose of the fob
jfA without diktffion. He hoped the committee
would not, therefore, be discharged. .
Mr. Hartley trusted the committee woyld not
be discharged. He believed the dellruÂ£tioa of Lis
bon by an earthquake did not oecafion greater raif
chiefs than the late fire had doae at Charletton.
The legislature of Pennsylvania, which had no
greater power than the general government to af
ford relief to these fufferers, had given 15,000 dol.
lars. Indeed he thought it more the province of
the general government than of state governments,
to afford-relief in such cases. He referred to what
had been given to the fufferen at St. Domingo, aud
to the parliament ofEnglatid having given l.icooeo
to the people of Lifbun, after the earthquake there,
though connected with them only commercially.
Mt. Kitchell was in favor of the committee of
the whole being discharged, because, if the fubjeft
lay over, the legislatures would beat a loss to know
whether any thing would be done by the general
government, and would keep back their donations.
If it oame within their power to relieve them, he
should wife to do it, tut not othcrwife. At any
rate, he thought it had better be determined at
present whether any (hing would be done in their
behalf or not.
Mr. Sprigg, jun. hoped the committee,
not be difdiaiged, but that they would go into the
business at an early day He said he had Â«*>t maÂ»e
up his mind how far they had a power to afford re
lief in a cafe like the present. There was an in*
ft a nice, he said, in the iclief afforded the daugh
ters of the count de Grafle, as well as that given
to the fufferers at St. Domingo. He wished for
further time to make enquiry on the, luhje&. If
there were not insuperable objections to the rac&-
sure, hÂ« hoped relief would be afforded.

FIRE.
About 8 o'clock last evening, an alarming site
broke out in the roof of a house in the College
yard, the property ef the Univerlity of Pennsylva
nia, and occupied by the Rev. Dr. Andrews.
The fire having got to a great height before the
â citizens aflembled, the utmoll exertions could npt
arrest its piogrefsi 'till it had destroyed the whole
upper part of the house, as well as the one adjoiri
ing.
Various ideas have gÂ»ne forth refpeftiog the o
rigin of this fire. It appears, however, from a con
sideration of all the circuriiftances, that it could
not have been kindled with design.
In a late paper we inserted some obfervatisns of
a European, strenuously recommending the use of
Holes, to be screwed on the Engine, in lieu of
the pipe, and of Efficient length to ejOend to any
qd3rter of the house : It clearly appeared that by
the help of one or two of these, in the commence
ment of the fire, its progress might have been
speedily arretted.
* # * Dr. Roesits begs leave in this public man
jier to return his wanned thanks to his friends and
fellow-citizens, for their exertions in the securing of
his property, during the alarming fire of lad evening.
Extraft#f a letter from Baltimore, Dec 28.
Â«Â« Repeated attempts have been made by indivi
duals to burn this town. Almolt daily alarms.â
Great numbers are dcte&ed and confined for trial.
Thismorninp, a biick dwelling house was set on
fire, and principally consumed, by a negra woman,
who endeavoured revenge on her matter for fevere s
treatment. She is also confined. The house be
ing near the water, thelTfc was got under, foai not
to communicate with any other."
To the Inhabitants of the City of Philadelphia.
The great inquietudes, terrors and apprehensions,
excited in the minds of fobcrand ton&derate citizens,
ky the very absurd and difgraceful practice, which for
many years pad lias prevailed in and near this City,
of firing guns on or near new year's day, induc ed the
Legiflitureof Pennsylvania to express their disappro
bation thereof by a law pafleU in ihe year 1774, where
in declared 'obe " a disorderly pra&ice, which is
"frequently attended with much mifchiet', arid great
â¢' lydiilurbs public peace," and in order'ro fupprels
the fame, certain fines and punishments arc infiidted on
petfons who thereafter should be convicted of having
offended against the said law. Notwithdanding which,
ptrfons have been found in this City, in every year
since the palling of the said Ail, who, in contempt of
law and good order, have repeated the unwarrantable
praAire iforefaid, and have thereby terrified and dif
tui'bed the peace and tranquility of good citizeus, and
endangered their lives and property.
In order therefore to redrain unprincipled and in
considerate persons from the commiflion of similar
outrages at the close of the present and beginning of
the next year, the Condables of the City are hereby
required and enjoirted to use the utmod vigilence and
diligence during the last night of the present year to
apprehend and confine in the common prison, all per
sons whom they shall find in the ftrcets attempting to
â¢disturb the peace of thi City ; and the citizens who
lhall then patrole the City for the protection thereof,
ire requeded tÂ» assist the Condables in preserving the
tranquility ot the City, and bringing offenders topun
ifhment.â
It is deemed necessary, for the effeflual fuppreflion
of the practice aforelaid, to carry the laid law rigor
ously into execution, and therefore it is wifbed and
hoped, that none of the youtli3 or other inhabitants of
this City, will expufe themselves to the disgrace of be
iny coafitlered and treated as disorderly persons, and
diflurbers of the public peace.

COMMUNICATIONS.
â  Demociatic v ; r tut is at an uncommon ldw point
of dejection and discouragement. It haa been the
delusion of several, (one or two Jacobins born,
and at lead two new converts) thai the Vice-Presi
dency was within the gtafp of each of the four
pretenders. Each took his chance, andadedCa
.as to make the mod of it. But, alas 1 what Gg
tiifies duplicity ? what avails a coronet ? To be the
tool of Jacobins, en this very profpeft, is nothing.
The claims of a law chief, and once federalift, are
iiothing : since we fee, that if a man dicks to his
like a Buna, even Virginia will faoner vote
for old Scratch, than for him.
The scratching governor of MalTaehufetts has
become remarkable by the name, as well as the
deed.
THE PLUNDERED STATUES, PAINTINGS,
AND MANUSCRIPTS.
Carry these preeions curiolities, fays the Aurora,
from Italy to France, âwhere they may4o fomt good;
that is to fay. take them by force from the country
â w! re they are almost worshipped, because they aug-
TiieiU its wealth, and ill&drate its own glory and that
the atti â , and carry them intÂ« the country which
warand anarchy have made a chaos-'-whel'e properly*
principles, men and government, are all revolutionary
and changeful as the winds. In spite of all the affec
ted veneration for the arts, Franpe has shed mjre of
the blood of the literati, and of clergymen, than the
pagan persecutions of the ehriftian religion, and de
stroyed not much less Â©f the precious remains of the
arts and sciences, than the old Gatbs and Vandals
_ i
What a hard (hip our Jacobins submit to ? To
defend Fiench principles after their authors have
given them Up, is a tough bufmefs. The edufe of
liberty, the rights of man, the happiness of the peo
pie, are itords, and very clever words, to collect
a mob. None are better to itop that cursed think
ing on facts that have flopped every Jacobin
rasuth in France. But fafhions will do far us after
they are worn out in Paris. The Boston Chronicle
is at this of time day the fitted tool of foreign in
fluence, becauf.- it is the dulled. Ignorant of prin
ciples, and heedless of experience, the thick head
ed paragraphias of the Chronicle go oo to extol
the happiness and liberty of F'ance. The very
words found ironically. Lit us repeat themâThe
happiness and liberty of France ! The knowing ones
t.f the club, already laugh at these droll woids.
To oppose Chronicle lies, take French evidence
" T.he laws with(Â»ut execution: The cunftituted
authorities impotent and disgraced : Crimes tinpuu
ifhed : Property of every kind attacked : Pcifonal
fafety violated : The morals of the people corrup
ted : N<> constitution, no government, riojultice."
â C Brifot's appeal to his confiituents J
1 his is ihe liktrty, the happiness, the Chronicle
extols. The readers of that venal Gazette knb*,
it is hoped, what it leads to in America. Folly
has had its day ; and Mr. Adet's appeal to the peo
ple, has cured many who tefufed all other mediefne.
SERIOUS TRUTHI
Without good morals, it is allowed, there ean
be no free, fepublic. The democrats have talked
as loudly as others on morals, but they have
tlbne more thaw all other men to corrupt them.
! heir admiration of French examples, has been a
contagioi. They extolled anarchy, and they vin
dicated ferocity ; and for a time, it feemtd as if
the meafnres in Pai 13 weie approved well enough to
be imitated. How mueh ien'.iments so falfe and
so tiuly hortid, as have had their da\ of popularT
ty in our country, have changed the milk of chari.
ty and human kindness, that wewfed\JÂ« have in A
maiica, into vinegar and aqua fortis, cannot he
certainly known. Confufidn if the democrats
could bring it about as they wilh, would (hew how
much more of the blood of fa hers and brothers a
fetond American revolution would shed, in coufe
quence of our being taught and accu.'tomed to
think so much more lightly of shedding it, than
we did during the firfl. God of his uiiircy forbid
that th* matter fliould be teiied by experience I
Anothet veiy great cause of the general corrup
tion in the United States is thisâLately, vice and
villainy have found a way tÂ» hold up their heads,
not only without thame or fear, but toith audacity.
Clubs receive difgractd men, bankrupts, swindlers,
over d-.f.wers at the banks, renegadoes from Britain
and lieland. Party combinations protedl men who
are shunned and abhorred by their btethren of the
fame profeffion. Is there no itiftsnce of a
merchant despised by all other merchants, trullcd by
nÂ£ne, driven from their company, whe huds sup
port from other quarters, and gets intÂ« power by
club influence ? The public is invited to attend to
glaring and foaudalous infla.ices of diltinction,
power, and public trust conferied upon individuals,
from whom ill piiÂ»ate trust has long ago been with
drawn : nay, more, who are thus advanced for the
very reason that their beggarly circuiuftances, their
profligacy of principles, and blaited chara&era,
qualify them to serve the party. For a conspiracy
againlt a free commonwealth, Catalinc is fitter to
be trusted than Cato. The paity judges right, it
is admitted. '
But is not the power of public opinion counter
ailed and wholly perverted, when knaves thus
mount above their altsnifhed accufcrs ? when they
pofTefs at leali public marks of honour, and hurl
their calumnies even agaiaft such virtue as'Wafh
ington's ? The democrats have certainly impair d
morals, which is one Sep towards fubverfing order.
Warning from the sfukQRA.
Fanchet, iÂ» his intercepted letter, calls the de
mocrats and the whisky infqrgents the patriotic par
ty. As Mr. Bache oftfen applies Ihe name to hit
rlan, it is lucky that we know its true meaning.â
The famtpatriots who rose in arms, and were quell
ed at the expence of a million and a half, he tells
us, will' have a place of shelter, if the French
fliould obtain pofleflion of the Spanilh country be
yond the Miffifippi. There, he faye, wilt be an
afyium for the patriots.- Another whisky infurric
tion maybe hoped for the sooner, bccaufe Bradford
& Co will then have a place of refuge, a t'afe asy
lum. This, Mr. Bache allures us, will be a great
advantage to the United States. t
Some perfous make the fuceefs of French prin
ciples an affair of duty, not of simple truth. HÂ»
ly infurre&ion, and fcttiug up the governed agaiuft
the governors, has been called the cause of liberty,
and thofc among us who denied, or even doubted,
the good tendency of such Wh'tfkey and Shays prin
ciples,' were denounced, oppof'ed and hunted at e
le&ions, or, when cliofen to office, fhndered and
news-papered aimed daily.
Will their Jacobin high mightinesses permit . b
to i'peak out, now that in their, fallen date they
cannot help it ? Has French republicanism fuceeed
ed ? Has not the experiment wholly failed ? Has
not American republicanism, as the President ob
fetved in' his Speach, facceeded wonderfully ! It
lias, and every farmer's, every mechanic's, and e
very merchant's experience, at lefts it. The causes
of this marked and signal difference depends 00
circumstances which every man of sense should in
veltigate calmly. Americans, he will fay, may be
and God grant they may ever be republicans.
The French are, if we may trust experience, un
fitted sot it. It is not our fault that they have fail
ed, nor is it our misfortune. Great cities we have
not, morals we have, uui "citizens live difpafed,
> they know fomethlnjr, anj they poflVij forhething.
I lie success of our government is therefore onr pe
p culiar and perhaps our finale felicity. If these
, Â»re true* it it any crime to offer thism
. to the public confiieration.
Bache having piiblifhed at last the statement of
the returns into the Colle&or's office, of the Port
, of Philadelphia, wherein it appears that FOUR
Ameiican seamen, and no more, hare been
ed by the British ; âonly a faint regard to charac
ter will now be requisite to prevent the continua
tion of those ahfyrd alTfrtions on this head, the
falfehood of which has disgraced even the Aurora.

before commodore Barney's door, to wish him the

Yesterday morning, about 8 o'clock, a fire broke out
in a house belonging to Mr. Maubry, near Prat't-ftreet,
1 j between Hanover and Charles-street. From some
I threats of a negro girl belonging to the family, and
I from its breaking out in the garret, it is supposed (he
designedly set it on (ire. It was an happy circum

j light, as from its h gh and inaccelTible lituation, the
j flames mull have spread far jnd wide before effectual
I means of prevention could hÂ»ve reached the place.
By the exertions of the citizens the fire was soon got
1 under, without much other damage to the house than
the loss of-an old roof. Uncommon regularity and
. alacrity were observed in forming and preserving lanes
for the supply as water.
We are requested to fay. that the citizens rtfidiag

tertain for the signal services of meflieurs Daniel Fi(b

and generous exertions, in and on the top of the house
on fire, saved it in a gait measure, with little other
loss than the toof, which was thrown off; by which
theflames were loon extinguiihed and prevented from

WHEREAS very large and heavy de">ts are juftty
due and owing from ineffrs. Blair M'Clenachan and in
Patrick Meore, of the city of Philadelphia, merchants, ei
trading under the firm of Blair M'&ltnachan and P. \ Â«
Moon, and from Blair M'Clenachan in his separaTe . K
capacity ; to which, by the laws of the land, all the ( ir
joint as well as separate property of the said Gentle- 1
men, ie, and ought to be, liable. And whereas |
it is clearly and fatisfaftorily ascertained, that mr. |
Bletir M'Clenachan, of the said firm, has conveyed ; f<
sway to mr. John H. Huflon, h-is foil-in law, to his e
daughter, miss M'Clenachan, and to his son, Gorge

as well as confiderab'.e personal property, in the city
and county of Philadelphia, in the county of Lancas
ter, in the eounty of New-Castle on Delawtre, and
elsewhere, with a view, as it is apprehended, to de

This is, therefore, to forewarn all pcrfons whomfo

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into public prints,
warning all pcrfons against purcbafing from the
grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and personal estates he conveyed away to
fais fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberatioa had upon the fubjeft by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenaehan and P Meore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confided in the fubferibers by
those creditors: a step which it would have been a
breach of .duty and honor in them to have omitterl.
The very statement of the fadt therefore must dif
pcl the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or visdictive." It originated in a desire to secure
the property of the debtor as a sand for the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fanflioned by the
â¢dvice of council as a measure necejfary to the fafety
of the ceeditor3. If the advenil'ement has been
injurious ta Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his (Twn unjuftiliable conduct, not to the fub
feribers who have merely piibliflied the truth iB
terms as mild as the fait would admit, and who
mean to in*eftigate in a high court of justice the
validity of thole purchases of which Mr. M'Cle
nsehan so confidenily speaks.
The fobicribsrs therefore are bound by a sense
as duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
caution against purchasing of those grantees or
, either of them, and to extend 4 the terms of it to a
purchase from any other persons (if such there be)
* to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made finailar
conveyances.

P R O S P E C T-H ILL,
Situated within one quarter of a mile from the Brandywjne
Mills, and hall a mile from the borough of Wilmington.
dwelling house is built of (lone, two stories high,
* genteflv firnfhed, and contains four handsome rooms <m
a floor, besides an entry, with Capital garrets, and convenient
cellars It is generally thought to command the most a
, greeable profpe& of the Delaware, from the source of that
3 rivet to the Capes. This profpe& ia greatly embdiifhed by
1 a full view of a vast body of meadow, through which the
; Christiana and Brandywine creeks are seen winding in bÂ«au
i tiful meanders. Near the hoafe are a Kitchen, a fpaciouÂ®
e hone liable and hay lot, a barn, a carriage houle, mihe
t ftoufe, &c. and a well of as puie water as any on the conti
q nent. The garden contains an acre and quarter of land, a
a bounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, of
v the very Deft kind, brought from Maryland, and in full bear
ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a voung, apple
orchard begining to bear, and Veveral old trees that produce
abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental treeÂ«, in
great numbers. The farm consists of near sixty acres of land,
of good quality, and clear of incumbrances, exccpt taxes,
twenty of which are now in excellent clover and timothy,
and ten more will be Teady lor sowing next fpiiag. A re
sidence ot nearly 8 yeari has convinced the fubferiber that
e the situation is remarkably healthy. The great post road
from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within seventy
T yards of the house. In a word, the beaities and eonveÂ»i- .
ence of this ntuztion cannot be enumerated in an advertise- U
[ ment, and when examined, will probably command tne at- t
tcntion of any person who is delimits of living at one of the
' most elegant country feats on the continent. The purehafer
