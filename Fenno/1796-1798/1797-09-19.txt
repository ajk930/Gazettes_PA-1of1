ters from James Reynolds and his wife to Mr. Ha

that the connexion between him and Reynolds,
was the result of a daring confpiraey on the part

Representatives as the People,
The Conftitntion has ordained, that war
cannot be declared but upon the formal and
neceflary proposal of the Executive Diredto
ry ; but it has also ordained that the Legis
lative Body has the sole supreme decision of
this queftibn. The constitution has ordain
ed, that in cafe of hostilities impending or
commenced, of menaces or preparations of
war, tgainft the French Republic, the Ex
ecutive liireftory shall be bound to employ,
forfthe defence of the state, the,means pla
ced at its disposal; but it has at\ the fame
ordained, that the Dire&cry (hall without
delay give information thereof to the Legis
lative Bcdy.
Yet, there is a people to whom treaties
unite us; and we do not know what is our
political fituatlon with refpeft to them.-;
On the one hand, the Executive Directory
pafles dtcrees which are real aggreflionsâ
declarations of war ; on the other, we fay
(0 ourliclv#*,-war-does not exist ; for the Le
gislative Body has not decteed it ; we ave
not in the predicament of hostilities impend
ing or commenced ; for the Legislative Bo
dy has not been informed of it.- Can there
fore the Executive Directory, at its plea
sure, add to or violate treaties and laws ?
If the general principles laid down upon this
fubjedt by the Constitution require develope
ment, does it not belong to the Legislative
Body to -demand it .' Ought it not to be re
membered that treaties are to nations what
laws are to . the citizens ? The expression

A treaty concluded on the 6th of Febru- ,
ary 1778, unites, by the double tie of Bom
meree and friend/hip, France and the Uni
ted States of North America. This treaty â¢
embraces fdfce articles, which I am obliged
to cite ; because they have become the
prctextfordivers decrees equally contrary to
the constitution and to the laws.
ARTICLE 11..
The most Christian king and the United j
States, engage mutually not to grant any
particular favour to other nations, in refpeft
of commerce jnd navigation, which (hall
not immediately become common to the |

freely, if the conceflion was freely made,
or on allowing the fame compensation, if
the conceflion was conditional.
ARTICLE XV,
And that more effectual care may be tak
en for, the security of the fubjefts and in
habitants of both parties, that they fuffer
no injury by the men of war or privateers
of the other party, all the commanders of

of the said United States, and all their
fubje&s and inhabitants, shall be forbid
doing any injury or damage to the other
fide ; and if they aft to the contrary they

thereof. '
ARTICLE XVII.
It (hall be lawful for the fliips of war of
either party, and privateers, freely to carry
whithersoever they please, the (hips and
goods taken from their enemies, without
being obliged to pay any duty to,, the offi
cers of the admiralty or any other judges ;
iior shall such prizes be arretted or seized
when they come, to and enter the ports of
either party ; nor (hall the searchers or
other officers of those places, search the
fame, or make examination concerning the
lawfulnefs of such prizes ; but they may
hoist fail at any time and depart, and carry
their prizes to the places expreflied in their
commissions, which the commanders of such '
ships of war (hall be obliged to (hew : on
the contrary, no (helter or refuge (hall be 1
given in their ports to such as (hall have '
made prize of the ftibje&s, people or pro
perty of either of the parties ; but if fueh
(hall come in, being forced by stress of
weather, or the danger of the sea, all pro
per means (hall be vigorously used, that '
thty go out and retire from thence as soon
as possible.
A RTICLE NXXIII. 1
It (hall be lawful for all and Angular the <
fubje&s of the most Christian ju'ng, and the j
citizens, people and inhabitants of the said ;
United States, to fail with their (hips with
all manner of liberty and security, no dif
tin&ion being made who arc the proprietors
of the merchandizes, laden thereon, from ;
any port to the places of tho,fe who now j
are or hereafter shall be at enmity with the
most Christian king, or the United States.
It shall likewise be lawful for the fubjefts
and inhAitants aforefaid, to fail with the
Ihips and merchandizes aforementioned, and
to trade with the fame liberty and security
from the places, ports and havens Â«f those
who are enemies of party,
withoift any oppflfitioii o"r disturbance what
soever, not only direftly from the places of
the enemy aforementioned to neutral places,
but a'lfo from flue place belonging -tt> ait
enemy, to another place bclo:igjr)g to an
enemy, whether they be under the jurisdic
tion of the fame prince, or under fevcral.
And it is hereby stipulated, that free (hips
shall also give a freedom to goods, and that
every thing (hall be deemed to be free and'
exempt which shall be found on board the
(hips belonging to the fubje&s of either of
the confederates, although the whole lad
ing or any.part thereof (hould appertain to
the enemies of either, contraband goods
being always excepted. It is also agreed
in like manner, that the fame liberty be
extended, to persons who are on board a free
(hip, with this effeft, that although they
be enemies to both or either party, they
are Mot to be taken out of that free (hip,
unless they are soldiers and in adlual service
of the enemy.
ARTICLE XXV.
To the end that all manucr of diflentlons
'. and quarrels may be avoided and prevented,
on and the other, it is agreed, that
j in cafe either of the parties hereto (hould
be engaged in war, the (hips and veflels be
j longing to the fubjeÂ£ts or people of the
' other ally, must be furnilhed with sea let
ters or passports, expressing the name, pro
â¢perty and bulk of the fhjp, as also the name
and place of habitation of the matter or
i commander of the said (hip, that if may
I appear thereby that the (hip really and truly
belongs to the fubjefts of one of the par
ties, which paflport (hall be made out and
granted according to the form annexed to
j this treaty; they (hall likewise be recalled
every year, that is, if the (hip happens to
. return home within the space of a year.
: It is likewise agreed, that fuclx fliips being
| laden are to be provided not only with
pafTports as mentioned, but also with
cytificates containing the several particulars
of the cargo, the place whence the (hip
failed, and whither (he ii bound, that so
it may be known whether aoy forbidden or
contraband goods be on board the fame ;
which certificates (hall be made out by the
officers of the place whence the (hip set fail,
in the accustomed form ; and if any one
(hall think it fit or advisable to express in
: the said certificates, the person to whom
j the goods on board belong,' he may freely
, do so.
ARTICLE XXVII.
If "the (hips of the faiff-fubje&s, people
â¢ or inhabitants of either of the parties (hall
be met with, either failing along the coasts
or on the high seas, by any (hip of war of
. the other, or by any privateers, the said
(hips of war or privateers, for the avoiding
of any disorder, (hall remain out of cannon
(hot, and may fend their boats aboard the
merchant (hip which they /hall so meet with,
and may enter her to the number of two or
three men only, to whom the master or I
commander of such (hip or vefTel (hall exhi
| bit his pa(Tport concerning the property of
the (hip, made out according to the form
inserted in this present treaty, and th<- (hip,
when (he (hall have (hewed such paflport,
(hall be free and at liberty to pursue her
voyage, so as It. (hall not be lawful to molest
or search her in any manner, or to give her
chafe, or force her to quit her intended
course.
Let me now present the decree palled by
the Executive Directory, the 12th Ventofe,
sth year, (2d March 1797.)
"Article I. The commifiionersof the ex-'
ecutive dire&ory, to the civil tribunals of the
departments, shall take care, that in disputes
concerning the validity of maritime captures,
no judgment (hall be rendered upon the 7th
article of the law of the 13th Nivofe, 3d
year, without firft consulting the minister of
justice, conformably with the 3d article of
the law of the Bth Floreal, xth year, rela
tive to treaties, in virtue of which, neutrals
may claim an exemption, in confequenec of
the firft of those laws, from the execution of
that of the 9th of May, 1793.
" Art. 11. The minister of juftiec (hall,
in consequence, examine whether the treaties
referred to,yet subsist, or whether they have
been modified finee their conclusion. The
minister of foreign affairs shall furnifh him for
this purpose, with all the information he
may (land in need of, and the former (hall
refer the matter to the executive direftory,
in the manner preferibed by the law of the
Bth Floreal, 4th year.
" Art. 111. The executive dire&ory re
minds all Fresch citizens, that the treaty
made on the 6th February, 1778, between
France and the United States of America,
has been, according to the terms of its se
cond article, modified of full right by that
concluded at London, on the 19th Novem
ber, 1794., between the United States of
America and England.
" Consequently,
" 1 ft. Agreeably to the 17 th article of the
treaty of London of the 19th of November,
1794, tranferibed below (1) all merchan.
dize to the enemy, or not fuffici
ently appearing to be neutral, laden under,
the American flag, (hall be confifcated ; but
the veflel on board of which it (hall be found,
(hall be released and restored to the owner.
The commifTaries of the executive dircftory
(1) ARTICLE XVII.
It is agreed, that in all cases where vessels
(hall be captured or detained on just suspici
on of having on board enemy's property, or
of carrying to the enemy any of the articles
which are contraband of War j the said veflel
(hall be brought to the tieareft or most con
venient port ; and if any property of an ene
my (heuld be found on board such veflel,
that part only which belongs to the enemy
(hould be made prize, aud the veflel. shall be
at liberty to proceed with the remainder
without any impediment. And it is agreed,
that all proper measures (hall be taken to
prevent delay, 111 deciding the cases of (hips
or cargoes so brought in for adjudication ;
and in the payntent or recovery of any in
demnification, adjudged or agreed to be paid
tp the mafter# or owners of such (hips.
are enjoined to accelerate judgment on liti
gations which may itrife cither concerning
the validity of the capture of cargoes or coij,
cerning the freights and detentioas, by all
the means in their power.
" 2d. Agreeably to the 18th article of
the treaty of London, of the 19th Novem
ber, 1794, tranferibed below (2) to the
articles de<Jared contraband by the 24th ar
ticle of the treaty of the 6th February,
17781 the following are added :
Timber for ship building,
Tar, *pitch and rosin,
.Copper in sheets, '
Sails, hemp and cordage,
And every thfngferving direCtly *or indircÃ
lyfor the armament or equipment of vefTels, un-
Wrought iron and fir planks excepted. These
various articles (hall be confifcated as often
as they fh&Il be destined, or as it shall be at
tempted to calxy them to the enemy.
" 3 1 '- Agreeably to the 21ft article, of
the treaty of London of the 19th Novem
ber, 1794* tranferibed below (3) every in
dividual known to be American, bearing a
commifliorj given by the enemies of France,
as also every sailor of that nation, making
part' of the Tew of the (hips or veflels of the
enemy, (hall be, on that account alone, de
clared a pirate and treated as such, without
being permitted, in any cafe, to alledge that
he was forced to it by violence, menaces, or
otherwise.
" Art. 4th. Conformably to the law of
the 14th February, 1793Â» the provisions of
the regulations of the 21ft October, 1744,
and of the 26th July, 1778, concerning the
manner of proving the property of neutral
(hips or goods, shall be executed according
to their form and tenor.:
" Consequently, every American veflel,
not having onTjoard a r6lÂ« d'equipage in due
form as prefepbed by the model annexed
to the treaty of the 6th February, 1778,
the execution of which is ordered by the
25th and 27th articles of the fame treaty,
(hall be good prize*."
Let us in jhe place attend to the firft
article. The Directory refers to the 3d
article of the law of the Bth Floreal, 4th
year ; but in referring to it, it adds to its 1
provisions. The law of the Bth Floreal
gives a power : the decree of the 12th ven
tofe imposes an obligation. It declares,
" the commifTaries (hall take care, that no !
judgment jbe rendered, without the minister
of justice being firft consulted." /Whereas
the law only declares, in the 2d and 3d ar
ticles, that " matters of. prize, in which
neutrals have any interest, shall be commu
nicated to the commiflary of the executive
direftory, within 24 hours from the filing
* These words are not contained in the
British treaty.
(2) ARTICLE XVIIL
In order to regulate what is in future to
be esteemed contraband of war, it is agreed,
that under the said .denomination (hall be
comprifcd all arms and implements- serving
for the purposes of war, by land or sea, such
as cannon, mu(kets, mortars, petards, bombs,
grenades, carcases, faucifles, carriages for
cannon, mu(ket rests, bandoliers, gun-pow
der, match, faltpewe, bait, pikes, swords,
head-pieces, cuiraflei, halberts, lances, jave
lins, horfe-fnrniture, liolfters, belts, and
generally all other implements of war; as
also timber for (hip-building, tar or rozin,
copper jn fhcets, fails, hemp, and cordage,
and generally whatever may serve direCtfy to
the equipment of veifels, unwrought iron
and fir planks only excepted ; and all the a
bove articles are hereby declared to be just
obje&s of confiscation, whenever they are
attempted' to be carried to an enemy. 1
And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on 1
the precise cases, in which alone provisions j
and other articles not generally contraband
may be regarded as such, renders it expedi
ent to provide against the inconveniences and j
misunderstandings which might thence arise:
It is further agreed, that whenever any such ,
articles so becoming contraband, according !
to the existing laws of nations, shall for that
reafou be seized, the fame shall not be con
fifcated, but the owners thereof shall be
fpeedfly and completely indemnified ; and
the captors, or in their default, the go
vernment under whose authority they aft,
(hall pay to the mhtters or owners of such
veflels, the full value of all fuclt articles,
with a reasonable mercantile profit thereon,
together with the freight, and also the de
murrage incident to such detention.
And whereas it frequently happens that
veflels fail for a port or place belonging to an
enemy, without knowing that the fame is
either besieged, blockaded or inverted ; it is
agreed, that every vefliel so circutnftanced,
may be turned away from such port or place,
but (he (hall not be detained, and her cargo,
if not contraband, be confifcated, unless af
ter notice (he shall again attempt to enter ;
but (he (hall be permitted to go to any other
port or place (he may think proper : Nor
(hall any vefliel or goods of either party, that
may have entered into such port or place,
before the fame was besieged, blockaded, or
invested by the other, and be found therein
after the reduction or surrender of such place,
be liable to confifaation, but (hall b'e restored
to the owners or proprietors thereof.
(3) ARTICLE XXI.
It is likewise agreed, that the subjeCts
and citizens of the two nations,' (hall not do
any aCts of hoSiUty or violence against each
other, nor eceept commiflions or instruCtions
so to art from any foreign prince or state,
enemies to the other party; nor shall the
enemies of one of parties be permitted
to invite or endeavor to enlist in thiir milita
ry service, any of the subjeCts or citizens of
tjie other party ; and the laws against all
iuch offences and aggressions shall be punctu
ally executed. And if any subject or citi
zen of the said parties respeCtively, (hall ac
cept any foreign commission, or letters of
marque, for arming any vessel to aCt as a pri
vateer against the other party, and be taken
by the other party, it is hereby declared to
be lawful f<w the said party, to treat and
punilh the said subjeCt or citizen, having
such comnaiffion or letters of marque, as a
pirat*. '
of the papers in the regiftiy of the tribunal."
" If the commifTary deems it nectjfary, he
(hall immediately referittothe minifterof jus
tice, who, after -having confuked the direc
tory, shall within a decade, answer the letter
of the commifTary."
The law expressly determined to avoid the
absolute obligation of a reference in all cas
es ; it determined it in order thar it might
not multiply the expenses and delays al
ways too heavy, always too long for those
who come to ask for j.iftiee. The decree of
the 12th Ventofe, on the contrary, imposes
it as an indifpenfible necessity. The decree
then is in contradiction to the law: it. is
therefore in itfelf a real legislative act : it
is then an iifurpation of a power which
the will of the people has riot delegated
to the directory ; and is therefore uncoHfti
tutional.
The minister of justice is to be consulted
in relation to treaties in virtue of which neu
trals clam an exemption, by the law of the
13th Nivofe, 3d year, fro,m the execution of
that df the 9th May 1793.
Let us firft turn our attention to these
two laws.
That of the 13th Nivofe, Aug. 7, fays :
" The national convention enjoins all the
agents of the republic, all the commander!
of the armed force, the officers civil and mi
litary, to cause toberefpeCtedand observed all
the provisions of the treaties which unite
France to the neutral powers of the old con
tinent and to the United States of America.
No infraction of those treaties (hall be made.
All provisions which are contrary to them,
are annulled."
The following is the law of the 9th May
1793-.
Article I. " The French vrfTels of war '
and privateers (hall stop and bring into the
| ports of the republic, neutral Veafels which
| may be foijnd laden in whole or in part, ei
ther with provifionsbelonging to neutral pow
ers and bound to enemy ports, or with mer
chandize belonging to enemies.
" Art. 2. Merchandize belonging to e
nemieS is declared good prize, and confiscat
ed for the benefit of the captors. Provi
| lions belonging to neutrals (hall be paid for
at their value in the place for which they
deftined.
" Art. 3. In all cases, neutral vefTels
(hall be released as soon as the unlading of;
the provisions detained, or the merchandize j
seized, (hall be effefted. The freight for
them (hall be paid at the price stipulated by
the (hippers. A just indemnity (hall be
granted in proportion to their detention, by 1
the tribunals who have cognizance of the
validity of prizes."
The law ofthe9thMay 1793, was repealed
onthe 2 jdofMay following, on thereportand 1
request of the committee of public fafety, ;
so far as concerned the United States. Five
days afterwards, on the 28th of the fame
month, the national Convention, on the mo
tion of one of its members, abrogated the
repeal, decreed that merchandize detained
Tiouid CL'.itinue proviflpnally sequestrated,
and that the united committees of public
fafety and of marine (hould make a defini
tive report to them irf three dsys.
This report was only made on the Ift of
July following ; but it confirmed the ex
ceptfbn pronounced by the decree of tbt
23d of May, in favor of the United States.
Of what consequence is it, said the reporter,
that your privateers have cruized unfuccefs
fully ? If we (lipulate for the interdt of
privateers, doubtless we (hall take no par-1
ticular notice of a faithful ally ; but when
we (lipulate for treaties, for the public faith,
we (hould not put into the balance with
these interests the produce of a few captures
of provisions.
The law of the ift July 1793, is thus ex
prefled :
" The national convention, wishing to
maintain the union eftablilhed between the
French republic and the United States of
America, decrees, that the veflels of the U
nited States are not comprehended in the
provisions of the decree of the 9th May j
conformably to the.l6th article of the trea
ty concluded onthe 6th Feb. 1778*"
On the 27th of the fame month, the fol
lowing decree was made :
" The national convention, after having
heard the report of its committee of marine,
upon the petition of the owners and crew of :
the privateer the Sans Culotte tie Honflevr, \
praying that the decree of May last
may be maintained, decrees, that it main
tains the provisions of the decree of the 9th
of lad May, relative to neutral veflels laden
with provifious or merchandize belonging to !
enemy powers ; that it (hall have its full
and complete execution ; and that confer j
quently all other provisions which may be ;
to the contrary are and shall be repealed;" I
Let us recapitulate th fe different laws,
let us combine them together ; let us fee
what is their result, what is consequently, in
relation to the Americans, the state of the
French legislation upon the subjeCt of prizes.
The law of the 9th May 1793, is the old
est : how shall it be reconciled with the 23d
article 6f the treaty of 1778 ?
The 23d artiele permits the French and
the inhabitants of the United States freely
and fafcly to frequent the ports belonging
toÂ« poWer in enmity with the two contract
ing parties or one of-them ; it not only
permits a direCt commerce from an enemy
pott to a neutral port, but even from one
enemy port to another; it adjudges'free
and guarantees all merchandize found on ;
board of vefTels of one >Â»f the two contraCt- j
ing parties, and this, when the cargo belongs !
in whole or in part" to enemies of one of
the two ; contraband alone excepted.
What in the mean time fays the law of
the 9th May 1793 authorizes French
(hips of war and privateers to stop and
bring into our ports neutral vefleU laden
with provisions for an enemy pojt, or with
merchandize belonging" to an enemy, and
declares this merchandize to be confifcated
for the benefit of the captore.
The United States of America were not
nairted in the law > nevertheless, as its pro- â 
visions are general, it was impoflible sot to j
comprehend them in It. The cfecree of the
23d May and ill July 1793; pronounces m
their favor an exception at ogee just and
conformable wish the treaty of the 6th Feb.
1778. It is pretended, that the decree of
the 27th of the fame month repeals it. 1
am far from thinking so ; no expression ma
nifefts it ; and in faft is it to be prefumcd,
that without the smallest diflcuffion (the
newspapers of that period do not even men
tion that the decree was proposed and pair
ed) a law was repealed, which been
made some \Yeeks before) made after, a pub
lic opposition, after a frefh consideration
twice adopted?"always at the request of the
committee of public fafety, and enafted ex
pressly to-prevent the Americans being com
prehended in the law of the 9th of May '93.
Howsoever it might be, the doubt, if
there exitteu a legitimate doubt, could not
lad longer than the 2d month of the 2d
year. For a law of the 27th Brumaire fays :
" Art. 2. The treaties which bind France
to the United States of America (hall be
faithfully executed."
" Art 5. The committee of public fafe
ty is charged to take measures for drawing
closer thi* bands of alliance and friendfhip
which unite the French republic to the U
nited States of America."
Behold ! what the national convention
declared, what it desired, even at the period
when perjuries and crimes'predominated ! It
exprefled the fame fentfment after the down
fall of decemviral tyranny. The 7th arti
cle of the decree of the 13th Nivofe, 3d year,
effeftually renews the injunction upon the ci-Â«
vil and military officers to cause to be ref
pefted and observed all the provisions of the
; treaties between France and the United
States. Have thele two laws been since re-*
pealed? they have not. Supposing then
that the decree of the gth of May 1793 had
recovered its force with respect to North
America, it loft ft again. And how ihen
is it pofllble to iriragine that the executive
directory should found themselves upon it ?
How imagine that the minister of jnftice
Could prevent the execution of a law in
force, and direst the execution of one re
pealed ?
The 2d article of the decree of the 12th
Ventofe charges the minister ofjuftice to ex
amine whether treaties, which came in ques
tion, yet subsist, or whether they have been
modified since their conclusion.
Wc are in the firft place aftanifhtd, Avhen
treaties between two powers are in qi:ertion,\
that the direftory should address itfelf to
the minister justice. The examination,
the maintenance, the execution of "treaties,
belong, by the nature of things, te the min
ister of foreign affairs ; and the law of the
| 10th Vendemaire, 4th year, contains au ex
press provision for that purpose. I never
theless conceive, that the question being con
sidered in relation to prizes, a fubjeft of ju
dicial cognizance, the direftory should ap
ply to the minister ofjuftice. But at least
it should not charge' him exclusively and
without limitation with the examination,
whether treaties yet subsist they
have been modified.
A treaty, moreover, is not the aft and
the property of one nation only ; it belongs
to the two nations who have fubferibed it ;
the confer* of both is neceiTary to destroy
it. If one of them thinks the other has
violated it, it may complain of .it: it may,
it ought to declare to the other, that it re
gards such or such an aft as an infringement
of the mutual agreement, a commencement
of hostilities ; but until then, until the mo
ment when the rupture is announced by a
refufal to explain, or an unjust explanation
of the party complained against, the trea--
ty remains a common' and reciprocal lav
for the two states ; it must be obeyed or/war
declared.
I know what will be answered. The
treaty, it will be said, was firft violated bj
the Americans : should we then be more
faithful than themselves ?
I know not whether this reproach, tak
' ing it to be true, obviates the remarks I have
made ; and as I little know to what extent
such an excuse is proper. If I should ad
mit, in the mean time, the validity of. the'
excuse and the precise application of the
reproach, the truth of the infraftion with
which the United States of America is char
ged, would still remain to be proved.
The' 3d article of the decree of the 12th
ventofe declares the treaty of 17 78to be mo
dified of full right by that of 1794. The
treaty of 1778 fays, article 2d: "France
and America engage not, to grant any par
ticular favor to other nations, in refpeft of
commerce and navigation, which shall not
immediately become common to the other,
party." What then is the modification pro
duced in this article by the treaty of the
19th November, 1794 ?
It is, fays the decree, in the 17th article
which direfts the confifcation of all enemy
merchandize, or such as does not fufficiently
appear to be neutral, laden under the Ame
rican flag.
There never was a maritime war which
did not induce difcuflions on the fubjeft of
prize, between the contending aud the neu
tral powers. The principles of different
nations have not always been uniform in
this refpeft : yet there is one of them which
is more generul, and which the law of na
tions does not disavow : it is, to take ene
my's property 011 board of neutral veflels,
and to rellore neutral property- fo)ind
on board enemy 'rcte. Â» Such was
always the fyitem of England. The United
States, who, until then, had no treaty of
commerce with her, severely felt the evil of
their veflels being flopped and even detained,
when in she end they must be restored. I
suppose that this consideration diftated the
17th article of the treaty of 1794 : but how
then does it modify the 2d article of the
treaty of the 6thFeb. 1778 ? Where then is
the particular favour it grantstotheEnglifh ?
The decree of the 12th ventofe afterwards
adds to the Catalogue of contraband.articles
mentioned in the 24th article of the treaty
made in 1778 between -France and NorUi
America, Lv. ..t '" 4 â¢
Twlxr for fiiip bulldftog, (
. Tar, pitch* ami rosin, |
CovÂ»pc in fl\eets,
Saris, hemp. Mid cordage, , /
And every thing, which may serve direft
!y or *inAirtÃly to the armament and equip-' .
meut of veflels, unwrought iron and fir
planks excepted.
Here also the treaty of 17 94 fe j.ves as the
pretest to the e>xcutive direftory. But
may it not be obfervfd, that these articles
were always and generally refpefted as 0b
... 'iefts of contraband in time of war, when a
fpecidl trenty, like ours with America, has
not pronounced.a clear and formal, excepti
on ? The British government has not, at a
nv tim? admitted Â» similar exception. The
18th artick; of the treaty of 1794 has then
innovated nothing in refpeft to these ; and
therefore occasions no modification. Eng
land acquires no new favour ; (he remains
in the situation in which till then she never
ceased to be ; and it may be asked how far
the executive direftory has a right, without
the intervention of vhe body, to
place among the articles of contraband, mer
chandize which an existing treaty has not
placed there.
The decree of the 12 th ventofe, still tra
> cing the modifications which it supposes to
exist, fays further :
'â¢ Every individual known to be an Ame
rican, carrying a commiflion given by the
enemies of Franc#, also every sailor of that
nation making part of the crews of enemy
veffcls, (hall be, on this account alone, de
clared a pirate and treated as such, without
being fuffered, in any cafe, to alkdge, that,
he was forced to it by violence, menaces *>r
_ Â©therwife."
The decree founds these provisions upon
the 21 ft article of the treaty between Ame
rica and England j but this article it similar
to the aift Article of the treaty ps 1778 j
and, in the one ai well 33 the other, it is
merely stipulated, that tUÂ« fubjeft or citi
zen ofoneofthetwocontrafting parties, w'uo
fhcllaccept any commifiion or letter of marque
from a foreign power, to arm a vessel with
intent to aft as a privateer against one of
the contracting parties, (hall be considered
and treated as a pirate.
Neither of these two treaties extends the
profeciition and penalty to other mariners
of the refpeftive nations.
I will not allow myfelf any other reflexi
on upon this, than th?t such a provision is
, barbarous.
The 4th article of the decree of the 12th
ventofe direfts the execution of the regula
tions of tl\e 21ft of Oftober, 1794, and
26th July, 1778, with refpeft to Ameri
can vessel*. It conCequentlv declares them
to be good, prize, if they have not on board
... a role d'equipage in due form, such as is
prescribed by the model annexed to the
treaty of the 6th of February, 1778, the
execution of which is direfted by the 25th
âand 27th articles of the fame treaty.
Without examining whether the particu
lar regulations of France can fubjeft our al
lies at home or on the open seas to observe
the fbrznalit ies which they have not stipula
ted for by treaties made with them ? With
out examing whether the-7th article of the
law of the 13th nivofe does not annul the
provisions of these regulations, where they
are contrary to the treaty of 1778,1 observe
that the article is grounded upon an error.
No model of a r6le d'equipage is annexed to
the treaty of 1778 ; tfee 25th and 27th ar
ticles do not even speak of it : the word
is not even once contained in a single sentence
of this long treaty. Never fiace its conclu- :
fion was it demanded from the Americans ;
every one knows their sailors are not classed-
What end then (foes a role d'equipage an
swer to them ? Before his departure, the j
csptain merely presents and leaves a lift of
the company he has, and upon this lift a
passport is dtlivered to him. See its form at
the end of the treaty } it supposes, it requires
nothing more.
1 have run over the decree in all its de
tails : let us now endeavour to colleft the
general motives for it.
The treaty of the 9th November, 1794,
is evidently the motive of the conduft of the
direftory. In the fupremc magistrates of a
people I like this civic aoimofity, this, anxi
ous and jealous zeal for the interests of the
country: I even believe, that the American
government has merited some just reproach
es for treating with its firft enemy without
communicating' the matter to its oldest
friend. In the mean time let us also recol
left ; that France had then no-longer a ma
rine which could protest the commerce of
the United States ; that the English were
the maftm of every sea ; that anarchy de
voured-our unhappy country ; and that at
the epoch of the treaty, the Americans re
mained ignorant that the 9th thermidur had
finally driven guilt from its throne.
Shall I add to these considerations a pic
ture of the conduft of the French agent in
the United States ? Hardly arrived in South
Carolina, where he landed, he endeavoured
to fowthe feeds of infurreAion and discord,
,to .make enrollments, to arm privateers:
he went further; he gave those, whom he
had thus armed ; he gave them, of his sole
and full power, on the terytory of an inde
pendent and free republic ; he gave them,
commissions to seize the veflels of nations
â¢â¢â¢ with whom the Americans were at peace,
to whom they were even allied.
' .Another minister plenipotentiary arrived
t at Philadelphia in the month of June, 1795.
He complained, that the treaty .of 1794
puts it out of the power of the United
States to form conveniently a new commer
cial alliance with the French republic. The
American government answered by commu
nicating the treaty itfelf: and observe that
,at that time it was not yet ratified ; it could
not therefore be said to exist. Observe also,
that these were not the only circumftariees
which produced trie idea of this compaft
between Great Britain and the United
States : those who have attentively follow
ed the courfc and progress of political
[*' The words in italics .%/ not contained

events, know that for several years its exist
ence was forefeen dreaded. France
and the United States had even expressly
declared, in the preamble of the treaty of
amity and commerce Concluded on the 6th
of February, 1778, that they mutually re
served the liberty of letting other nations,
at their pleasure, participate in the fame
advantages.
I repeat it ; I am far from approving of
the treaty of 1794 ; more courage and at
tachment perhaps became these brave Ame
ricans. But after all, us again view
them still 3ffoeiated with a people without a
marine, whocould neverthelefsably defend its
alliesbyland.bfltnot uponthefeas; Scefpecial
ly upon those diftnnt seas where the British
veflels maintained an undisputed, undivided
rule ; with a people without a government,
delivered up to all the furies of anarchy and
guilt : but finally, if the United States have
violated the duties of decency and refpeft,
they have violated no engagement, they
heve usurped jio right ; they have only
availed themfelvgs of the universal right of
nations, to form contrasts when and how
they please. Are we then the sovereigns
of the world ? Are our allies then only our
fubjefts, that they cannot make contrasts
at their pleasure ? And truly, it is not a
little lingular to hear the French govern
ment alltdge the treaty of the 19th Nov.
1794, t0 bean aft of hostility, whilst they
themfclves order all Americen veflels to be I
captured, without having declared war. j
yho docs not know, that since the com-'
; mencement of the sth year, a great num
;.ber of them have been confifcated .1 And
almost all, the faft is remarkable, belonged
! to men known for their attachment to the
I French. They have been taken with t))c
< double violation of an alliance and of liof
pitality : they have been taken in our very
port?. But lately, an American captaifi
was ioiprifoned at Bred, is not this to
â nwit thf reproach we so often 08ft.
the Engli(h, of forgetting upon the seas
all good faith, all juflice ? Even lawful re
prisals could only authorize us to seize Bri
ti(h property in American veflels ; but we
take the veflel itfelf; and we even take the
American property it contains ! Neverthe
less, as was well observed a few years ago
by the present vice-president of the United
States, Mr. Jefferfon,.whofc sentiments to
wards France are known, according to the
law. of nations it cannot be doubted, that
the property of a friend found on board the
vessel of an enemy is free, and that at the
fame time the property of an enemy found
on board the veflel of a friend is lawful
prize.
America had to fear at firft, to have
for enemies England, Holland, Spain, all
then at war with France. In the midst of
this universal struggle, would it then be
criminal to preserve towards all an ufeful
neutrality ? Is it not known, that in such
a political situation, the neutral powers be
come the maritime carriers fcr the powers
at war ; for the latter (land in need of their
own (hips and sailors for warfare.
In another point of view, two courses pre
sented themfrlven to France ; to receive suc
cours from America, and to make ufeof her
against England j or to permit an alliance to
be formed between England and America.
It is at firft view inconceivable, why the for
mer (hould not obtain the preference, why
we (hould lose the fucc#urs of an ally, why
we (hould not give to our enemy one enemy
more ; the fceblenefs however of the mari
time succours which America might furnifli
i us, rendered delusive, in the particular cafe,
. the advantage which, in a general point of
view, so agreeably presented itfelf. The
' other course, on the contrary, of placing
j America between the two combatants, to
| make of her, by her alliance with each of
the two, a neutral power with refpeft to the
other, would offer to us in the.United States
(as an allied power, considered in relation to
us,â as a neutral power, considered in rela
tion to England who is contending with us)
great facilities in navigation and commence.
I am far from attaching to these reflefti
ons the importance of a demonstrated truth j ,
I only present them as doubts : I merely
wi(h that they may contribute, to bring the
two countries-back to those principles of
moderation and friendfhip, whieh will in
crease their mutual strength : I wi(h that,
by injurious bravados, unworthy of itfelf,
the government may no more.alienate a peo
ple whom we ought to cherift both for the
good they-have done us and for t-he services
we h* v e rendered them. We .complain of
the Americans ; but has not Washington, in
his last address to congress, solemnly con.
tradifted those imputations so v3giie, so un
certain ? We complain but wlist would
have been our conduft and our language, if
we had seen, a 6 in America, a foreign mi
nister plenipotentiary begin to levy troops
and fit out privateers without the permiflSon
of the government ? We complain ; but are
not the United States the firft peÂ»{sW\vho
acknowledged our liberty ? Was itÂ®o*?rodi
them we feceived, in times of difficulty,
(whatever ingratitude and bad faith may fay
of them) those nourishing grains of jwhich we
were in absolute want, and for which I "do
not know whether they are yet paid ? Did
not the legislature of Carolina very lately di
rest to be paid- to us a sum which remained
due to us, immediately and by preference,
although this legislature was partly compo
sed of the owners of (hips and goods which
ivcnf just confifcated in the American seas
by French veflels ?
Behold also what was their conduft at
the moment when they learned, that the'
French government, deceived by its agents
in the colonies, fuffered itfelf to be drawn
into prejudices still more unjust. A new
ambtiffador was suddenly difpatehed to the
direftors of the republic. But to whom
was this honorable mifSan confided ? Cir
cumtlnnces required more imperio-ufly than
eveV, a firm and decided friend of peace ?nd
of France. America pofleffeda man, who,
being a courageous defender of the liberty
of his country, happy iuhaving contributed
,tp its birth and confolidatiou, always pre
served for the people, whoft fuscous pro
tested the acquiiition, an unalterable fenti
aient of gratitude and affection ; a man,
whom we can but little f lfpefit of predilec
tion or favor for Great Britain, inasmuch
as during the W3r of"American indepen
dence, liis property in Carolina, where he
lived, was evtr the firfl delivered .up to de
vaflation and the flames. Returned to his
fields, as soon as peace* w f concluded with
the former oppressors of In's he
lived afar swim all public cmplbyments ; and '
it whs there that he was fought for to be
engaged as the mediator between two peo
ple whom he' loved, and the peace-maker
of America. -Complaints plight be made :
these are the explanations he cam?, to ofler ;
he carr.e to enlighten the French government
concerning the conduct ofits agents, and their
calumnious imputations call upon the Unit

found. Those who have been discovered are Tru
man Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, said now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several others who go under fictitious names. It is
supposed that the binds offered fcr sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at least worth fifty thousand'
doliars. Such as we have a<stual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and 12, Otfego patent,
thousand acres each, the a<9ua! property of William
Pellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. C'haumont, now of Paris, and James Averill
and other., ol this Stmte. There is some grounds
to fuppofc that the lands of Richard Wclis and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing thofc lands, as also to de
prive those men in future from imposing on indivi
duafs, which their education and address have en
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a Ihopkceper of some note in this eountry.
The following affidavits will fit in a clear point
of view the wick.dnefs of those men,which when
the public have prrufed, will induee them to ex
cufc the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 28th, 1757.
I Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led into an error, by John Witcomb and
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for lot No. 58, Otfego patent, svhich
was the property of William I â  Franklin now, Mr.
Chamont's and others ; and further the said Joseph
and Truman did pcrfuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made out on the icth day
of November, 1793, or set back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and further the name of
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fictitious name,
there being no inch perlon there. To this I make
voluntary oath. i , THOMAS KELLY.

On the 18th July, 1797, came before me Jacob
Kibby, a person by ttie well ki:own and worthy of
good credit, who on his fnlemn oath did fay, that
two of the parties abovementioned did make ap
plication to .him this deponent, funic time in the
winter of 1796, to make them a deed for two thou
sand acrts of land in the Otego patent, and pro
mised this deponent a share of the profits, on the
sale of said lands, for his so doing ; andth it they
made application several times for the fame purpo e,
which fsrviegs this deponent as often reftifed, de
claring to them that he had no right to lands, and
coulddo no such thing ; which daring attempt 011
this deponent's integrity he had related among his
friends several times, previous to making this affi
davit. JACOB KIBBEY.
