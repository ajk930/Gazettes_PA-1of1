FRID \Y EVI'.NING, FEBRUA9T 13.
For the Gazette of the United States.
efttSions on the ftefent Jlatt of this Country.
The Jacobins baÂ»e left no artifice or falfe
hood unefTayed, that are like to deceive
thtir fellow-citizens, or to divert their in
dignation from the crimes ef France. One
of their mast common tricks has been, to re
present that many headed monster, the re
public, as waging war against the tyrant) of
Europe, to ettablifli unirerfal liberty and
peace ; when nothing can be more foreign
fromthe truth. The cafe is just the reverfcj
this common enemy has invaded the rights
of all ether nations, and, abroad as well as
at home, has (hewn the mod daringcontcmpt
for every law and principle, that it reverenc
ed among men. Their footftrps are mark
ed with rapine, desolation and (lavery every
where.
Whatever these deceivers may publifli, or
their dupes may believe to the contrary, it
is clear, people of France are as far
: from fighting for liberty, or enjoying it, at
this day, aÂ« ever Rome was under her mod
detested tyiants. That phrenfy, which pqf
feffed the sovereign Canaille, at the beginn
ing of the revolution, and which was in
dulged by their leaders, until ther had de
stroyed the ancient monsrehr, has given
place to a lethargie rtupor, the confequenpe
â¢f universal, and unexampled oppreflion.
Their nqeks are now become callous; they
ire ready to receive the yoke from any hand
no matter how vulgar or infamous.
After fighting like devils, for 7 years, to
conquer liberty, as they phraze it, the people
of F rancc arc, at this instant, the most con-1
tcmptible llaves existing. There is nothing
that they dare call their ownânot even their
foulsâfor their tyrants have decreed that
they have none.
It is one Barms, a rebel Gens d'armes,
that now presides at the head of the Divan;
and the power which he apd his colleagues
acquired by violence, they now retain, by
oppressing all that oppose them. It is an
insult to common sense ; it is a profanation
of the name of liberty, to couple it with
such agents, or such a cause.
How vain is it therefore to look to the
present degraded race of Frenchmen, for
another struggle in behalf of their violated
rights ? how much more so to cxpeft they
will exert themselves, to defend their allies,
or neutral nations. If this work ever suc
ceed, it ntull be undertaken by the armies;
and as soon as they have fim'flied their work
of deftruÂ£tion abroad, it is very probable,
that these apostles of liberty will turn their
hands on their own government, and'pull it
to pieces. Cffifar and Pompey, either u
nited or opposed, will easily give a maftier to
Rome. The crimes of France; the repose
of Europe ; and universal justice ; all point
to such an issue as fall approaching.
As soon as the military chiefs have got in
to n good understanding, and have fettled
their plan of operations, Barras and all the
other civil tyrants of France, if fuffered to
live, will become mere pageants; they(will ;
be as contemptible as the Roman Senate,
under Tiberius, or the Caliphs of Mecca, '
under the Grand Turk. The present drou
fy race of Capets are unworthy the throne
of Charlemagne; they have not a man of the
family, that has courage enough to 4ontÂ«nd
for it.
But whatever may be tie future fate of
this degraded people ; whether they are des
tined to groan long, under the scourge of
vulgar tyrants, or to submit to the milder
sway of their ancient line of princes ; it is
happyforus thatthe alliance betwernFrance
and America is at an end. God forbid it
should ever be revived! Fraud, infoler.ee
[ and rapine have, at length, broken those
bands with which treachery, intrigue, and
hvpocrify, had once enslaved us.
It is true; we have fuffered great'and re
peated insults; to this day our merchants
are plundered by sea and land, without the
smallest hope of relief or redress; we eom
plain, and are refufed, even, the compliment
of a hearing: but these evils are alias light
as air, when compared with the mifchiefs
and dangers of so treacherous a friendlhip.
The affair is now at issue. We must either
<gree to submit to every injury, that the
ferocious Gaul can inflift, or resolve man
fully to repel his aggressions. It is not e-
HOHgh to defend Ourselves, and to proteA
our commerce, but we ought to aflail the
enemy by every means in our power. To
vibrate between peace and war ; to wait for
the return of honour and ju!lice in a nation
of robbers; would be the crime of an idcot.
When I call to mind the animation that
glowed from north to louth, against the
claims of Great Britain, in the year feven
ty-five, and compare it with the dastardly
tamenefs that prevail* at this instant, when
every thing that is dear to men and christi
ans is brought into ten-fold greater jeopardy,
I am astonished at the change : I can hard
ly persuade myfelf that I live in the fame
country. One of two things is clear : we
have either degenerated with unexampled ra
pidity, or the zeal, that operated the revo
lution, was something far lefi neble than
the love of liberty.
" How fV'r our ancient glories, while we run,
" 'l'o court far deeper bondage, than we (hun !
" Where isthe gencrons, a&ive, riling flame,
" 'll at boasted liberty's immortal name *
4 * El z d lor its right* infring'd, it* trophies torn,
" ADd taught proud Alt-ion herm:I 1 akc to mourn,"
If a seven year's war with Great-Britain,
to effe&uate a separation, and an enormous
load of taxes that have ensued ; if so many
pompous, annual, feftivities to celebrate the
day of our liberation are all to rcfult in a
feeble government, in (lifcord, and anar
chy, among ourselves, and a tame, das
tardly fubmiflion to the rapacity, infoience
and ambition of France ; I fay, that the
Icliange !i a Calamity too great for
tion j that the resolution instead of a bltf
l ling is a cnrfc that will wheln its authors in
prrpetual infamy ; and hand their names
down to posterity with growing execration.
That the danger I have just hinted at, it
no chimera of the imagination ; but a real
and tremendous evil, that approaches near
er and nearer every dayâ[ appeal to every
man the pr?fent state of' this
, country with serious attention. To be
plundered and insulted abroad, without dar
| ingtu resent it ; to be weak, divided, and
| despised at home ; are strong symptoms of
| a sickly and declining frame, whith it re
quire* the fervid patriotism of 75 to re-an
imatc.
It behoves the men therefore, who have
receivtd the applause of their country, as
its heroes, and saviors, to looJc to their own
werk ; and cither to secure it by more ener
getic meafiires, or if such fltould be their
unfortunate deftfny, bravely to fall in the
Â£ttempt.
But although 1 am fnre that the present
situation of our affairs is extremely serious,
it is by Ho means desperate : our evils are
owing to our own fupiÂ«enefs, and want of
spirited exertions, more than to the real
power of the enemy. There is strength
and virtue, enough in the friends of govern
meiit, not only to defend the country and
its interests againll all foreign aggrellions,
but to tread its intelline enemies under feet,
if they were properly roused, and called
into aftion.
But perhaps we wait for the return of our
commiflioners, and a formal declaration of
hostilities on the part of perfidious France ?
Heavens ! is there any man of a right mind
who would judge of peace or war by words
and net by adHons ? The French will not
declare war against these states ; no, though
they were landed on our coaftt. They will
still a flu re us that it is not war that they in
tend : it is only to regulate our government
and to bring about the repeal of some liher
ticirie a&s of Congress, or the fur render
of some obnoxious treaty we have made.
Such were their profefiions to the Holland
ers, Brabanters, Genoese and Venetians ;
and what has been the confequenee ? All
these countries have been swallowed up by
the devouring ambition of France. The
monster, which has already destroyed or en
slaved some of the fined countries in Europe
will not spare the United States. The cave
of Polyphemus has ftili room enough for ;
mare vidims, and we fetm tÂ» court the fa
vor of being the last.
Can we imagine that the dire&ory, who
have hitherto blended artifice with open
force against even the weakest states of Eu
rope tkat they have overturned, will pro
claim their hostile intentions by a formal
manifefto, when they are convinced that
they can Tuin us much sooner without -it.
It is'impoflible ! They would be as stupid
as thty are profligate, if, while we fuffer
their outrages so patiently, and are wholly
taken up with intelline jars, they should by
an open avowal of their designs, put an end
to our private contests, warn us to dire&
all our leal against them, and so deprive
their pensioners, in and out of Office, of
one of their moll specious, arguments. For
my part, I do in my conference think,
| and 1 do not hefrtate to declare, that, from
I the day they refufed to hear our just com
i plaints, and difmiflfed the meflenger of re
; conciliation with contempt, they a&ually
declared war against us, and at the fame
j time left us no room for doubt, or hope of
peace.
AMERICANUS,
From the DEDHAM (MafT.) MINERVA.
PLAIN TRUTH.
Report fays, that our Commiflioners at Paris
are required to fay that they are authorised to a
grec on the part of our nation to the annulling
of the treaty with Great-Britaiu, otherwise to
quit France without even being allowed to
complain of the wrongs and lodes we have
fuffered from tUe French in violation of their
treaty with us This, if true, Â«wouid shew that
they cannot possibly think more highly of them
feJves, nor more meanly of us. It is like this
cafe, one man goes to ano'ther to complain'that
he is wronged, and for his only fati&fa&ion
gets kick'd out of doors- Laying out of thfe
question, however, the provoking insolence of
this treatment, let us examine calmly for one
moment the justice of the French complaints 1
agaieft the United States. Our treaty with
England operates unfavourably to France ; we
arijnftanold quarrel with that country, which ,
they would like to foment and keep alive. We
are reconciled with their enemy, is the eternal
burden of their song. In five plain words, they 1
wish to fee us at war with England. '
We agree to trade with their enemy, that is '
another grievanceâWhy not ? Did we ever
promise,"or are we bound by treaty or otherwise \
to deny ourselves the benefits of a fair and free {
trade v.ith all the world ? We did not prom
ife it. As a fovefcign liate, we regulate our own
trade and other concerns, and are riot accounta
ble to France : If we are so accountable, our {
independence is yet to be gained, we are ftiil <
colonies, i
Toftiewhow deceitful and how weak this
pretended obligation to deny bene- f
fits of an open fade with England is, let us <
look at the conduct of France herfelf. First,
the republic has decreed a navigation all as hard
upon American trade as that of Britain. Se
condly, {he required an enormous duty on 10- ]
bacco imported in American bottoms; from t
which French Qiips were exempted. Thirdly, j
she has shut her islands against the most lucrative
part of our commerce. Molafles and Taffia, a .
very bad kind of rum, being all that her perma
nent peace regulations allow us to bring away ; *
and there is little besides lumber, that we are al- <
lowed to carry to her islands ; our fifh was by >
heavy duties alraeft prohibited ; flour she sent
out from Franee. The war at present fnfpends (
tPefe prohibitions, b\it peace will renew them. t
. Now if we are bound ro help Fiance as much
as wc can, fuTcly it is but fair that she should 1
help uÂ» and our trade in turn. Yet the cases
j'.fl mentioned are public and experienced con
ditions of the principle afiumed by France, and â¢
recommended by parties for the fclf-denying
pra&ice of our nation.
Our confiituted authorities were bound by
oath, and by every principle of duty, to pro
mote by all lawful plans, the good of our coun
try in preference to the advantage of France or
' any other state. Mr. Jay's treaty gave us the 1
- * wcftern ports, which we fcould not hive hi J
! without atreaty,or a war with England,
i It put an end to the expensive Indian wr, snd.
the feed* of other Indian wars will not be so
s ready to fproct as when a hostile neighbour
â¢ flood ready to sow and cultivate them,
s | An immenfdy valuable and increasing trade
1 with the Eafl-Jndirs is feeured on a solid foun
. dation by the treafy.
r The to flea of onr merchants by unjust cap
tures, are in a wav to be compensated âpart cf
s the monry is actually paid, more it decided up-
on in England by the treaty commiilioners, and
the payment of the remainder is more to be
[ hoped for than the recovery of one dollar of the
f fen or fijteen millions Ã¼bjufily captured by the
French.
And finally, Ms. Jay's treaty hat giveit our
Ihips better security from British capture, than
we enjoyed before the treaty,'much better than
the friends of government generally ex
a security which our newfpipers, and the rcfo
lminns o/ bodies of merchants announce to â¢<,
our trade ar p'r<fent actually enjoys.
A man itiuft he blind and stubborn indeed,
who will not fee and acknowledge that the good ]
of our country required that we should avoid a j
war with Britain, and fecure'the iorewuntroned '
and other ad vantages, by an accommodation of
difputp*. That our ft* eminent waa bound to
iiurfue tins policy ; that the United States, by
their own hefts in ereft, have given no

How often do we fee some men, at one hour ca

Various as the weather ; which it alternately plea
fantandunpleafant. I'his sudden transition ot the
mind is frequently productive of evil conference ;
j we ought, therefore, to keep a conflanc cenriael
over it, nor fuffcr it to be either too qiuth elated
ior deprefled. 1 here is a certain class of men, who
appear to be.never exempt from this misfortune.
I mean those, who afre fubje<Jk to a disorder, com
monly called the HyfÂ», a disorder, which extin
gu fhes every rational faculty ? and puts the son] at

tacked with this complaint; and, when under its
influence, acSls more like a madman, than a rea
fonakle being. Though surrounded with friends,
he efteeim himfelf torlorn ; and though polLffed
of, every bLefling, which can make life desirable,
infills upon his poverty, and emphasises upon the
decline of his pecuniary circnmftances. He thinks
every one his enemy, and believes friend (hip to
be merely nominal ; full of ostentation, without
any of thofc intrinsic virtues to which it lays claim.
Such a dileafe is truly unenviable. It crowds the
imagination with gloomy objeAs, add spreads o
ver the mind the veil of fadncf-. Reason is ban

extreme of often hurries its objeA into
imprudences, and sometime* makes him adopt fatal
determinations. What idea can be more ihocking

wretcheilnefs, which he fuffered, or deduce it from
any origin.'. His station in life was agree hie, and
his circumffances proiperous. Yet he was apt to
fuffer hiÂ» mind thus to be deluded with imaginary
evil, while he had every reafjn to feel grate nl for
the superiority of hi* situation. Being to
whim and caprice, he was ever under the com

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 2i.
The ufuai time of calling the house to
order being arrived, the Clerk desired mem
bers to take their feats, which being done,
Mr- Kittera said, the Speaker had desi
red him to inform the house that he was so
much indisposed as to be unable to attend j
the House to-day. Mr. Kittera, fuggef- â 
ted the propriety, therefore, of adjourning '
the orders of to-day till to-morrow. <
J. Williams did not fee a necessity for :
this. He thought the house might infor
mally go into a committee of the whole on
the report of the Committee of Privileges. t
He had seen this course taken in other le- <
giflative bodies and as it would be the means j
of saving a day, he hoped this mode would 1
now be adopted. J
Mr. Thatcher hoped gentlemen would j
notconfent to go on with business in an in- t
formal manner, iince it was evident they were ,
fufficien'ly informal, with all their forms. j
Mr. Harrifon enquired if there was any
probability that the Speaker would be able '
to attend the house to-raorrow. If not, he
should be for chufing a temporary speaker.
Mr. Kittera said, the indisposition of the
speaker was occasioned by a severe head-ach,
to which he was fwbje& ; that it generally
continued for fix or eight hours, and after
wards he was perfe&ly well. 1
The queltion for pojtponing the orders ' 1
of the day till to morrow was then put by J
the clerk, ?nd carried ; and then the house J j

came into the house, nor did I fee the com
mencement of the fracas j I was in my feat,
engaged :n writing, when ray attention wag ex
cited by the found or report of a heavy b!o\V $
I looked to the quarter froii whence th* found
seemed to proceed, an<J saw Mr. Lyon on his
feet, in the place where heufually fits, and Mr.
Grifwold in the area, in front of him, beating
him over the head anri shoulders with a cane or
walking stick ; Mr. Lyon appeared to be en
deavouring at once to the blows, and to
extricate kioafelf from the chairs and defies of
the row in which he flood ; hefoon was in the
area, and Mr. Grifwdd continued to beat him,
keeping hin. at such a diliar.ee that the blows
could rake effefl, until Mr. Lyon turned and
ffod behind the partition, in the rear of the
fpeakrr's chair, whither he was pursued by Mr.-
Grifwold, ft ill beating him ; as I remained in
my place, they were for a moment out of
my fight* which was intercepted by the partition,
but they almost immediately appealed again,
Mr. Lyon holding in his hand the tongs, which
lie grasped by one leg ; Mr.Grifwold seized wi;h
his 'left hand the arm by which Mr. Lyon held
the tongs, and closed in with him, and ihortly
afterwards I saw them come to the ground to
gether, Mr. Lyon falling under Mr.'Grifwold.
1 then left my place ; the members fathered
round them, and they continued ou the floor
for a few moments, Mr.-Lyon being Hill under
Mr. Grifwold, until they vrere parted by one
m'ewnber separating their arms and fhdulders,
while others fetzed.each, one of Mr. Gril
wold's legs, and in that manner dragged him
off. When tliey were separated I went to Mr.
Grifwold, and.observing that he had Â»not his
cane, advised him to get it again, left hefhould
be afTailed by Mr. Lyon who was now on hit
feet. Mr. Gtilwold desired the assistant door
keeper to find hirtane,&thenwent,at my instance,
totakea draught ofwiter; myattention was then
diverted from them for a short time, until it was
again excited by a new alarm in the lobby, at
the louth end of the hall ; on looking toward
that quarter, I saw both Mr. Grifwold and Mr.
Lyon in the lobby, but at the drftance of fix or
feet from* each ottffer ; Mr. Lyon herd a
cane in his hand-j and a? I battened towards
that end of the room, I was met by the afliftant
doorkeeper, who handed me Mr. Grifwold's
cane, and, appearing unwilling to interpose, re
quested me to give it to him ; I did'f and Mr.
Grifwold immediately advanced," apparent
ly to renew the attack on Mr. Lyon, when the
speaker called the house to order, upon which.
Mr. Grifwold directly relinquished his design,
turned round and went to his feat, as I did to
wine. S.SJTGREA.VES.

after prayers were read, I saw Roger Grifwold
come into the hall, with a hickory stick in his

: hink) fct his stick by it, and placed himfelf in
the feat usually occupied by Mr. Dennis, or Y.r.

letters ; soon after I saw Matthew Lyon come
into the hall with a stick or cane in his*hand ;
he went dire&ly to his place, put his stick be
hind his chair, and set down ; after, fettinga
short time. I observed him to cast his eyes ear
ueftly at Mr. Grifwold ; then he direded his at
tention to some papers before him, on his table,
and seemed to be revising and folding them ;
I looked at both alternately, and thought that
Mr.Grifwold eyedMr.Lyon, but did not intend
any pcrfo-i should observe it; while Mr. Lyon
Was examining his papers aforefaid, I saw Mr.
Grifwold rife from his feat, and advance towards
Lyon with his usual pace, having his stick in his
hand ; I believe that Lyon did not fee Mr. Grif
wold, until he was within reach of
wold immediately struck Lyon over the should
ers, with the little end of the cane or hicjcory,
aforefaid ; Â»t seemed to me, that when Grif
woldfirft struck, Lyon was partly raised, or in
the attitude of rising hastily ; Grifwold repeat
ed the blows untH Lyon got clear of the feats ;
t en'Lyon advanced towards <jrifwold, as if to
elofe in with hiin ; Grifwold retreated, as if to
avoid it, still repeating the blows until they got
to the fire place, behind the fpeakÂ«r's chair ; then
Lyon took up the tongs, and rhey both closed ;
Grifwold threw Lyon on the floor, and fell upon
him. I then went away anJ saw no more of
the affray. Ido not recoiled that I heardene

to the office of Recorder of thii city.
r.OMVV A ICATION.
IN the late interview between Buona*
parte and the French Executive Direflory
the Citizen Miniiler of foreign affairs, who
presented him, told the General " that a
new eoemy was calling on him. Let the
genius of Buooaparte make him soon expi
ate his hatred and tyranny, and diSate to !
tl t tyrants of the sea, a peace worthy ot j
the of the French of Republic."
Buonaparte then delivered to the Presi
dent, the Emperor's ratification of the
treaty, and nmenj other things, said,
" V his peace fiemtt the liberty, the pros
perity, and the glory of the Republic."
An orator who not long before made a
fpeech before the assembled DireÂ£lory, tho't
d.fferently. He declared no at the
defireof the Direftory, " that the govern
ment of Great Britain and that which pre
vails in France, i*ere incompatible, a;.d
could not both exist."
â¢c _ Buonaparte, however, persists in think
ing otherwise. He adds, and his words are
remarkable, " When the happiness of the
French people (hall be firmly fettled on the
basis of the bell and wisest laws, all Europe
wit be fret." Not one word does he men
t'on of the prÂ®pofed conqueflâbut, concei
ving that under the present government of
France, the laws are not the btjluni ivifeft â
and clJnfeqiiently that freedom cannot be
fciiu exist there as it does in England,
1 where the public felicity and individual
fafety depend on known and not on
the variable caprices of menâhe widles a
change, and hopes, that when peace is once
efkblifhed, and France freed from the pre
sent revolutionary tyranny, not only (lie,
but all Euroe will be free; that is, frttd
from the defp'otie, unwarranted interferen
ces, of the terrible jrepubiic, in the domestic
affairs of the refpe&tve nations of Europe.
After having atchieved the conquell of
Italy, made peace with the Emperor, and
guaranteed by solemn treaty, the exigence
( ot the New Italian Republic, he seems to
think of refling from his laboursâHe does
not incline to ijtep across the channel and o
remin England. The DireSory, however,
it othwwife disposed.
,f Citizen Generaf!" fays Barras the
President, " crown so glorious a career by a j
coitfpieft which the nation owes tt> its out- j
raged dignity. Golâand by the pnnifh- t

tât'-hefe, with nineteen twentieths of the

a mass of wickedness and vice ! and the par

At Card's Mills, in the town of Fairfield, u

between Mr. Levi Whipple and Mr. Hardy p
ti>e former upwards of 60, and the latter o
much ftort of 50 years of age. The dispute t;
â¢riginatcd from fame trivial circumstance e
over a friendly bowl ; andfo impetuous were n
their passions, that not haying pistols handy a
they agreed to make use of muskets ! The w
ground being appointed, they repaired to h
it immediately, each armed wish d"Mnlket. p
u.d attended b,y a second. Having agreed b

â¢ f I upon the moJk nf figkt-rg fwh'cb wps that
' J tbey should turn b. ck to back, flep off a
certain nun.ter of paces to their refpe&ivc
t llations, come to the right about aÂ»d Jrt)
they proceeded to decide the eonteft : But
though a lucky mijlaie of Mr Whipple or
his second, his picje was only half cocked;
and, fortunately, Mr. Hardy's did not go
off, though (he slashed in the pan ! The fe
â conds then interfered and dtffuadcd them
from renewingthe combat. Thus we fee that

AT a juncture when the question of
a Commercial Treaty xui'.b France may soon
become an objcA of difcufiion, a work of this kind
becomes extremely ufeluf to those eitizÂ«n3 of the

selves to view this fubjeA, undents various af
pe&s ; and they will have the fatisfadion to be
furnifhed with the neceflary data, to pdge,of the
â¢fefulnefsof this tranfadion.
This work is principally diftinguiftied by the
richness of the observations, the pcrfpieuity of the
Uc&s, and the modesty of the theory which it
contains. At Pars, a man of wit observed, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn k hcaped up
to the very roof with ufciul produce. It is addrt f
sod ta the unfortunate La Favitte, in letters, |
which fugitive form, the author who could only
devote a Tew weeks to this occupation, was obliged
to adopt. Although aircurnHancis are in many
refpeds different at the present day, from what
â¢hey were in the year 1790, when these letters
Were written, yet k may be jufily laid, that so ma
ny abialuteand permanent data still remain, that
wie judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lets on that account ; on the contrary, as many ef
the alterations, which have been made, are the re-

LETTER HI.
EiTayin the forna <fl tableau, to appraise the im
poiUaon.s into the United Slitetfrom France and Eng
tand unlcd. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better furnilhed from France or
Englandâlt is principally on this fubjeft (which
would hiave allonilhrd a me e th.oritl) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kini of tablcawt, uuluckilv as difficult to obtain as
ftiey are muf;h to be defned, arc the only sure guides
the statesman can take for th policy of treaties, de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We ennot too much admire the apparent ex
adwefs of colonel Swan's calculation*; and although
the propbcfies of Lord Sheffield have already been
contracted by experience, and by fevcrai able pen?,
yet it is cui ious to fee the author of ihe present work,
dispute with him the only ground on wh:ch he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the required condition, will be better able
than Great Britain to lupply us with fcveral articles,
which the English aathoi allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's paJtiaiity ajfett on (if he
has any) does not appear to have at any time created
a partiality ojjudgment. # T he result of this calculation
is that in >709, that iÂ« to fay, at a period when arts
and manufaduies did Â»0t present in France the vast
means and probability of extension which they now
pofTcfa. that even in 1789, it was presumable, that
France would nrft only have the means to supply one
half of any'given ouantity of the produ&ions of France
and k ngland united y butalfoto enter into competition
with Great Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wildom of her government, and Wie indurtry
of her inhabitants
LETTER IV.
Calculation of the expectations of the United States,
>nd particular examination of their suitableness to
France; this is one reason why, notwithstanding the
excell rÂ»t work ot Mr. Tench Coxe, Mr. Swan's ta-
Mcau is by no means fuperfluous . the principle of the
advantages which would result to France from the
importations f provifioocand raw materials, is every
where applied ; 2nd it is upon this argument, that

as the United Statesâthe happy condition of Ameri

Europe, are contrasted in the ablest manner, and un
der the most striking lilatior.s, by very cu ious cal*
culations âObservations on the wisdom and economy
which preside over the public cxpenfes irÂ» Maflachu

pride inlpires. The ancient governments of Europe,
fayahe, will iefcrn from us the art Â»f economv in
recernpenfing the feivices which the country receives.*
Amongjl us it will k 6e fitn y that men are chajtn for places,

hands as the government of the United States.
