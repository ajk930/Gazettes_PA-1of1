Fur the Gazette of the United States.
Ma. FEN NO,
I have not the smallest doubt but Con
grifj will duly appreciate the advice given
them in yeur paper of Thursday evening,by
" A friend to laws and freedom." If poli
tics alone were affe&td by his remarks, I
(hould not have taken this notice of themâ
But in order to render his reasoning irri-firt
ible to Congress, he has introduced a kiad
of mercantile arithmetic.-"
I conclude, that considering the members
of Congress as mere politicians, he hadfup
pofed that they would be so bewildered in
his arithmetical logic that in order to extri
cate themselves they would be obliged im
plicitly to adopt his conclusionsâBe that
as it may, his arithmetic is certainly very
fallacious.
He goes upon the idea that the capture
of one vclfel out of four sent out by a mer
chant mull proportionably raise the value of
the other three, because it will make pro
viliotis scarcer. This would be true if the
cargo in the captured velTel were destroyed ;
but notwithstanding the capture, the cargo
I goes to market ; if not to the fame illand,
to a neighbouring one âSo that r in faiS, it
wouhl be better for a nation fhat a veflel
should founder than that flie (hould be.cap
tured ; for in neither cafe is the country
indemnified ; but in the former the cargo
cannot go to market in competition with 1
our other produce and so lower the market;
in the latter it mayâAnd yet the friend to
laws, &c. fays, that in the former cafe there
is a national loss, and in the latter not.
One other delusionâthat the national
loss is not so great where the ycflel taken is
insured as when it is uriinfured. It is true !
that the individual loss may not be so great
in the former as in the latter, for the infur
aÂ»cc may be by a company and the proper
ty owned by an individualâBut as it ref
pe&s the nation, the loss is exa&ly the
fameâThe property has gone out of the
eountryand'nothing is returned for it.
I have thought it proper to make these
observations, for fear that our merchants
and underwriter,, being convinced by the
reasoning of the " friend t* laws &c.'' that
they loft nothing by the captures made of
their veflels, should be induced to priva
teer upon their Â«wn property âFor certain
ly it would be a great saving to thtm, to
take the one vessel out of four, which he
supposes may be taken by an enemy without
injury to the country.
AN EN EM Y TO NONSENSE.
Dee. 15th.
From an Eajlern Paper.
European intelligence; of the moll recent
dates, furnifhes nothing consoling to the
friends of peace. Accounts from Hamburg,
to Oft. 4, mention, that the negociation at
Udina, was positively at an epd ; and the
German troops were marching for the fields
of controversy. The French armies, our
readers will recolleft, were ordered to be fil
led up by the 6th of Oft. Thus on both
fides, is note of a dreadful combat given.
On the Rhine both power, have very form
idable armies ; and Gen. Buonaparte, on
the other fide of Germany, has a powerful
chain of pods at Udina, Belluno, BaiFano,
Verone, &c. which menaces Germany, from
the borders of Austria to Tyrol. We know
not what force the Emperer has to oppose
the French in this quarter, but if it is not
powerful, the firft intelligence we may re
ceive, maybe his appearance underthewalls
of Vienna ; or a division pafliug the Tyrol
country, attack the flank of the Gennan ar
my on the Rhine ; while the powerful force
of Angereau afiails them in front. Those
who delight in human carnage, we doubt
not, will befoon gratified.
OneÃailleul.areprefentativein she French
council of 500, published an address to his
conflituents in August last, in which he de
clares to them, and to all France, the
majority of the two councils favor a royal
id conspiracy, and that the nation is betrayed.
On the 30th of August, only five days be
fore the late explosion, a motion was made
in the council of five hundred by Duprat
(one since banilhed) for a vote of censure a.
gainst this incehdiary address of Bailleul.
The tumult and violence of the debate that
ensued, tho' common enough there, are
scarcely to be described or conceived by A
mericans.âThey calledâ robber, rogue,
and murderer ; but Hopped, however, Ihort
of blows.
Duprat expatiated upon the evil tendenay
of this address, and moved that it (hould be
referred to a committee to report the proper
measures to be taken against the author.
Hardy, and others of the party of ' the
direftory, then a minority in the councils,
opposed this, and exclaimedâ" Dare you
violate the liberty of the press ?" Yet, on
ly five days after, 32 out of of the news
papers then printed in Paris, were fuppretT
ed by the direftory. This is liberty of the
press ! Tallien, on the fame fide with Har
dy, diftingui(hed himfelf by his zeal. In
answer to the reproaches call upon him, for
the many murders of which he had been
guilty, he gonfeffedâ" that he might have
committed some errorsâhe might have been
hurried away by the ardor of some principles
âhe had perhaps concurred in the deuth of
some reel patriotsâbut such was our fate,
that republicans must die by the hands of re
publicans."
It is curious enough, that Tallien made
this defence becaufc he said, it was impor
tant that the members (hould not be viftims
of the fouled aspersions. What could his
enemies have charged againd him more
scandalous and horrid, than he has said of
himlelf to clear up his character ? It is tf
pecially singular, that this fame lamb like
Tallienâthis babe of grace, concluded his
harangue by recoramendiug to tbe council, 1
mutual fqrbearance ( harmony and brotherly 1
love, and " that they would extinguish ev- 1
ery passion for .the public weal."
If one Could possibly fufpeft, that there
was any hypocrffy in politics, especially in
regenerattdiPrance, the numerous bombas
tic profeffioHS of love for liberty and patri
otism, and love of mankind, so fafhionable
in their legislature, would not be in.future
so edifying and comforting to their admir
ers, as they have been.
From the ALBANY GAZETTE.
Mejjrs. Printers,
In a lectrft-vifit to the Cohoes Falls, with
gentlemen, one of the company un
dertook to account for this molt wonderful
cataraft, and gave it freely
as t JhisÂ» that the time was when the
waters below vthe falls flowed on a level with
the bed, river above. An idea at once
so novel, aadrtp us improbable, although en
forced by philosophical arguments, and a
depth of reasoning to which it was impofli
ble for us to reply, had 110 conviftion on
our mindi ; the old opinion, that it Was so
from tjae... beginning, being firmly Seated
there.
On my return, in casting my eye over a
volume of Coxe's travels in Switzerland, I
found this ingenious author to entertain a
similar opinion of the falls in the Rhine.
As it is a matter worthy the inreftigationof
the curious, I have made an extraft of it,
and fend it for insertion in the Albany Ga
zette, not doubting but it will be accepta
ble to lome of your readers.
" About three miles from the commence
ment of the Via Mala (fays our author) we
came to a (tone bridge of a single arch,
thrown across a gulf; a sublime scene, which
I (topped to admire, and which I left with
regret. The Rhine falls in a beautiful cas
cade, n.lh in a narrow channel at the depth
of above 4QO feet perpendicular, furioufly
dalhinjf under the bridge, expands itfclf
in a and there is loft under a
rock,, through which it has forced a pafiage.
" The impending mountains, partly bare
and partly embrowned with firs, call an aw
ful gloom over the gulf below.
" I was here greatly struck with one cir
cumstance, which I examined with much
attention, and which I had observed in sev
eral other vÂ«Ulit;s of Swiueiland, but never
in such perfeftion as at this place.. The
Rhine, Which is at present about 400 feet
below the bridge., fecnis evidently to have
once flowed as high, or even higher, than
the place where the bridge now stands ; to
bave gradually worn away the rock, and ex
cavated the deep channel in which it now
runs." . . qpf
NJEW-YORK, December 14.
From,recent European accounts it appears
that unless our Envoys so the FrÂ«nch Re
public, accomplish the objeft of their mifli
en, .by a treaty stipulating reparation for
pad injuries, and a more friendly conduftin
future, no hope of averting the ruin of our
commerce will remain, but what depends on
our own measures and refoiirces. From the
decree" in the Council of Five Hundred, dis
avowing the apparently amicable motives
which aftuated tfiat body a little before the
ljje violent change, to adopt tbe report and
the motion of Paftoret; and from certain
unfriendly decisions by the Maria e Tribu
nals, we may infer, that unless engagement*
are entered into, and rtligioufly observed,
of treating Vis Vyith mpre equity, the fame
piracies will be exercifedon our (hipping,
which, during the two lad years, have so
indelibly tarnilhed the annals of the Repub
lic.
That their privateers have been fuccefsful
in crpizing against the American, as well as
Britilh commerce, is a known truth ; and
the induftrioui preparations to catty it on
more extensively than ever, leave little rÂ«om
to hope for the escape of any of que mer
chantmen, bound to the Bntifk European
dominion^.
If then, by a denial of national juftiqe,
we are to continue exposed to the fame and
greater lifques, from French cruizers, and
from the unprincipled paricides of Ameri
ca refidentjp France*âJf no resource, but
but repelmig force by force, -remains, if, to
submit tamely to the blow aimed by an af
faflin, be fynonimous with deliberate suicide
â(hall we continue to fit with arms folded,
without one attempt, one effort to avert our
deftru&ionNoâWe do not desire warâ
we folieitoufly wish for .peace with its at
tendant bleflitigsâour pafl conduftis an a
dequate proofj and v our obviousiniere Its are
fufficient pledges, of this. But put
ourselves in a posture of defence. Let us
aflame a repulsive attitude. Let cir ves
sels be armed. Let them no longer be the
prey, of.ruffirns, unprovided themfc|ves,.
with the means of offenfive operatron, and
formidable only by their numbers and -cha
racter. i >
It is not uncommon to find cowardice as
sociated with cruelty. The miferablc pol
troon who fees a weaker individual in his
power, feels no sentiment of humanity, but
gives a loose to the molt boundlcfs cxceffes.
Whei ehe finds him felf matched,br his pow
er overbalanced, the contemptible jvretch
is as abjeft, as/he hefyre (hewed himfelf des
potic.
This serr.ark is-Jtonfirrtfed by an incident
which late. l y t(Â«jkplaee iu the Britilh chan
nel. * Art armed American 1 hdiaman (that
defcriptioflare'permitted to carry guns) was
met by Â« French privateer full of men, who
after firifig into him.'ordeled him, in terms
the mod Sominet'ririg, to heave to, and
threatened fnftant deffruftion in cafe of nen
compliance. The American, calm and un
moved, sent one ball into the picaroon,
which so deranged his courage, that he im
mediately with the magnanimi
ty of a hero, gave himfelf lip. Oilr coun
tryman bid hmi â¢flve'er off, and be more care
ful in future how he meddled with Ameri
cans.
This, with other fafts of a similar com
plexion, (hews at how little expence one half
the property facrificed by our forbearance, -
might have been fstved ; and bow great a \
part of tbe disasters incurred by our nier- i
chants, might have been avoided by the fin- i
gle permiflion to carry a few guns. i
The idea of being involved in war, by i
measures of felf proteftion, is chimerical and â 
degrading in the extreme. If we may not ;
defend ourselves when attacked, how con- i
tetnptible i 3 out situation ! We may at i
once renounce independence as the shadow
of a (hade, and acknowledge the United
States to be colonies of whatever power i
pleases to seize upon them. Let us think
like the Treiident, and with him declare,
thatâ
Nothing will contribute so much to the
prefer fat ion of pea<?e, as the'ifiilnifeftation of
that energy and unanimity, of which, on
many former oocafions, the people of the
â¢United States have given such memorable
proofs ; and the exertion of those refourc '
es for national defence, which a beneficent
Providence has kindly placed within our
power." '

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
THURSDAY OECEYBER 14.
Continuation of the Debate on the fuijefi of
Foreign Coins.
The Honfc having resolved itfelf intoa Com
mittee of the whole, Mr. Dent in the
chair, on the Report of the Seleft Com
mittee relative to Foreign Coins, and Mr.
Nicholas's Resolution having been read.
Mr. Sitgreaves said, he had mention
ed yesterday, that there was in his opinion,
an obvious distinction between the cases of
Gold and Silver Foreign Coins; and all tbe
reflection he had fmce given to thefubjeft,
had confirmed him in the conviction which
he then exprefled. He moved, therefore,
to amend the resolution under consideration,
by adding after the word Â«â¢ Foreign/' the
word " Silver," which would have the ef
fect of confining the suspension of the aft in
favour of silver,' and leave the aft of 1794,
to operate on gold coin. If, said Mr. S. j
the design of the Mint had been only to
gratify the pride of Sovereignty, the object
would have been inconsiderable and unwor
thy of the expence of supporting it ; but it
was established for far more important ends.
It was, that the Government might have a
control over, its circulating medium, which
was efTer.tial, in order to prevent its debase
ment by alloy and fraud. This debasement
was chiefly applied to Cqpper and Gold
Coin, but not so much to Sib(*r. He saw
no t reason, therefore, why Fqreig.i Silver
Coin, which had long been cntrent irt this
Country, (hould be forced ofH.-of circulati
on into the Mint; they were of the fame use
and value with any which might be re-issued;
but it was very different with refpeft to
Copper and Gold Coin, which was subject
to be debased in so many differei t ways, and
which could not be prevented, until we had
a fufficiency of our own coin, which would
be under our own direction and control.â
Let the ftoppzge of French Crowns take
place when it might, it would be attended
with some inconveniences, yet the period
mutt arrive, if the Mint were to be support
ed ; but he conceived these inconveniences
would be felt in a very small degree with re
fpeft to Gold Coin. The proclamation of
the President of the United States, which
notified that Foreign Coin would oeafe to
be a legal tender after a certain day made in
Oftpber, 1796, related to both Gold and
Silver Coin; but the notice refpefting Gold
Coin was much farther removed than that
of Silver ;' it was not to go out of circulati
on, till July next, whereas the silver coin
had already gone out of circulation, except
that it were payable at the Banks and to the
Revenue Officers. It was, iherefore, much
more irt" the power of perfrins holding Gold
Coin to get it out of their hafirls brio re the
time arrived. The quantity of Gold coin
in circulation, compared with the Whole cir
culating medium, he said, was very final!,
and therefore, but little inconvenience crtald
arise from its circulation being flopped; and
on account of the probability ofGold coin,
it would be much tafier transported to the
feat of Government. But the mod import
ant consideration was, the present mutilatrd
state of Foreign Gold Coin, which rendered
it impoflible for those who were not well a %
qtfainted with the detail of bufidefs, toguard
against frauds. In the State of Pennsylva
nia* -not one man in 50G was in poffefiion of
3 pair of Gold Scales, and without thum, it
was impossible to afcertaiti wtertjjer gold wa&
weight or not, and there were (till tuwer per
foas, if they had scales, who knew the;eal
value of gwld Â» when it was deficient iif
weight. This great evil in the middle dates
whatever might be the cafe to the Eailward
and Southward, convinced him, that the
sooner Foreign Gold Coio was thrown out
of Circulation, the better. Bllt it was yes
terday said. that when our own gold coin
(hould get into circulation, it would he e
qually fubjetV to debajement, and therefore,
that it would be impossible to pass it by tale.
He would not fay, that, in the course of
time, this might not take place j but on
theoutfet, trade and intercourse would be
coniiderably facilitated, by having a proper
medium of our own; and when our gold
coin (hould become corrupted, by clipping,
See. it would only have to be returned to
the' Mint to be re coined. These eonfidera
lions had induced him tu'make his motion.
Mr. J. Wilciams wasagainft the amend
ment. The observations of the gentleman
were favourable to the cities, but not Jo the
extreme parts of the U.nion. Suppose it
were practicable or n'ecefiary. to call in the
Foreign Gold Coin, where would the Mint
si id bullion to replace it; The difficulty was
the want of bullion; and if they prohibited
the circulation of Gold Coin they (hould
prevent its increase. And even if they had
fufficient bullion, he thought the works of
the Mint too contrasted, to coin a fufficien
cy for all the purposes of the United States,
and he did not think it would be right to
to extend them, since, if a Nation were to
have its Mint, it (hould be at the feat of
Government, which in two years, was to
be removed from its prefeni fitnation. As
to the prefeat EftaMUhment, it had been at
tended with considerable expence, without
: affording any benefit, except to this 'City.
Our own gold, the gentleman said, would
' not for a long time'be either clipped or swea
ted; but when it was, it might be returned
-to the Mint to be re-coined; so that there
would be a conllant routine of sweating,
clipping and coining. But the gentleman
said, it was impossible to prevent imposition
in receiving the gÂ»ld coin now in circulation
as few persons were possessed of gold Scales
he was certainly mifipformed in this refpeft,
as few persons who were in the habit of re
ceiving any eonfidorable sum of money, were
without gold fsales, or ignorant of the val
ue of gold; Why then, compel people to
fend this coin to the Mint? Was it because
they were (hortly to be called upon for far-,
ther sums of money to support thÂ« establish.
ment, and gentlemen wished to give it the
appearance of ufefulnefs! With whatever
view it might be done, he certainly 'could
not agree to it.
Mr. PiNCKhEY was in favour of the refo.
lution of the gentleman from Virginia, with,
out the proposed amendment. He was a.
; gainst agreeing to the report of the'commit.
| tee, because, it would either produce no cf
' seA, or an injurious one. Gentlemen diff
ered in opinions as to the effed ; force sup
posed it would depretfate the coin, othtis
thought it would produce no such effefl.
To him this was immaterial. If it did not
tend to depreciate the coin, it would have
no effdft to force it into the mj'nt ; there
; fore, the arguments of gentlemen went toe
far. And, if it did tend (to depreciate
the coin, it would have a very injurious ef
j fcCt He did not fay this because he was
| against the establishment of the'mint ; he
I believed with the gentleman from Pennfyl
; vania (Mr. Sitgreaves) that it migh be pro
dudtive of gdod ; but he did not think this
the proper way to fiipport it.
Mr. Otis rose with some regret, and a
good deal of diffidence, on this question,
bec&ufe his opinion differed from both the
gentlemen whd hadjuft delivered theirs. He
I was equally opposed to the. ;Â»mendments of
j the gentlemen from Pennfylvahia and Vir
j ginia, and in favour of the original report.
Heconfidered both the amendments as hav
ing a tenderÂ«cy to undermine the mint es
tablishment ; if that of the gentleipan from
Virginia were agreed to, that institution
would have but a fliort duration ; and what
ever credit may be due to the ingenuity of
that gentlemtfli, and others who support his
motion, for this indiredt attempt to deitroy
it, be thought it behoved gentlemen who
wi(lied well to that institution, and consid
ered it as connected with the national pros
perity, to pause, before they gave a vote
which (hould'go to this effeft. If the mint
were found to be an inconvehient establish
ment, and the expence of it greater than
the'convenielice, let a proposition be bro't
forward, and let the question be fairly met,
and not endeavour to effect its overthrow in
the way proposed. In order to elucidate
his assertion, that this proposition would ds
ftroy the mint, he would enquire how tfee
mint was to be supported ? It could not be
supported with fufficient bullion, except by
means of the foreign coin now in
Bullion was not imported in large qnanti-.
ties into this country. In looking into a
riport on this fubjeft, he found the quanti
ty of bullion imported was fnhall. Govern
ment had no power to traffic in it, and our
merchants did not aften import it ; there
fore foreign coin was the only aliment with
which the mint could be fed. And if th#
business of calling in this com were post
poned for two years, no argument ..would
then cxift forfloppi.ig the cTrciilatjon which
did not flow apply ; thev should thin be told
that the expence of reeoinirig won d et
ceed the utility of the measure. It had
been said that the measures recommended
by the report would not have the effeft qf
throwing foreign coin into the mint, finÂ«e
though nearly ("even millions of revenue w-ete
received from the cuftom-lioufe, little of
this coin had been sent there heretofore.-r-
Tli'is, Mr. O. said, could not be expe&ed
when there was no restraint laid opon thi
banks to do it ; besides, dollars had been in
gre&t demand for the London and Ball-In*
dia markets, and the bauk bad found it re
ctfTarj v to keep back their dollars, and pay
out their . towns. ' Hereafter this reafoijW&. government might
, tTi.ike their deposits o.\ condition that the
toix-ign coin fliould be sent to the mint
With refpeft inconveniences which
would be felt by the"-peop!e, he did not
think they Would tje so great as had been
reprtlented. And upon whom, he asked,
vfould tliefe difficulties fall > Not upon the
potner daffes of the people ; they had al
ready experienced the inconvenience, for,
if they pufleffed a few crowns wheri the
proclamation was, iflued, they had been o
bliged to part with them, and had fuffered
by their depreciation. It'would then be
lhbfe people who had bought them up, who
would be benefited, provided the 1 , aft were
to be suspended, and the crowns were paya
ble at their full value in fea-pcrts, they ne
ver could be depreciated more than one or
two per cent, in any other par* of the coun
ty He hoped, therefore, the report would
"be agreed to.
Mr. Nicholas said he never yet voted
against the mint, and he did not know why
the gentleman just fat down fliould have
deemed him inimical to the edablifhment,
except from the reason of the thing, and be
' cause He was not, like himfelf, a slave to
whatever had been ettablifhtd. . It was said
his proposition was an attack upon the mint;
if it were, he did not want a greater conces
sion toprovethe eftabliflimentufelefs. When
the law for cftablifhing the mint was passed,
it was expe&ed the coin of the United
States would have infinoated itfelf into cir
culation, and stopped that of foreign coin.
If this had happened it would have been of
small consequence to the people to have had
it put out of circulation ; but, on the con
trary the quantity of our own coin was found
to be small, and that if the circulation of
foreign coin be stopped, the country would
be diltreffed for a circulating medium. He
therefore wished to suspend the law. Was
this to attack the mint ? If the mint could
not exist without impofmg upon the pesple,
they acknowledged it could not exist. And
where, heafked, would be the advantage, if
all the foreign coin in the country were to
be transfcred into the mint ? It had been al
lowed by the gentleman from Massachusetts,
that dollars werean article of exportâwould
not then, the dollars of our own coining,
equally with "the Spanift dollars, be sent
out of the country ! And, in return, our
merchants would bring foreign coin,fo that
all the coin in the country would become an
article of merchandize. If government
could procure bullion on moderate terms,
aud put fufficient coin into circulation, it
would be a different thing ; but it would
never do to take from the people the coin
they now used, without having others to
supply them with. Mr. N. denied that peo
ple could go to cuftora-houfes, and exchange
their crowns for dollars ; crowns would be
received there for duties only. And he beg
ged gentlemen to consider what would be
the expenee of fending this coin to the mint
to be recoined. There would be the carri
age and infnrance, and it would at least be
fix months irj returning, the interest upon
'which would be a dead loss.
Mr. S. Smith never conceived the esta
blishment of a Mint in the country would
injure the people so much as it appeared it
would do, in the view of this business.
He did not fee how the difficulty was to be 1
removed. If the report of the committee 1
were to be agreed to, crowns would be re
ceived by shopkeepers at a dollar ; they 1
would bring them down to the sea-ports and 1
pay them to the merchants at 110 cents,
and the merchants would pay them at the 1
Custom House. But how were the crowns <
to get from the different colic ft Â«rs into the j
Mint ' Would the United States undertake 1
to bring theih there ? In most of the cities I
there were banks, and the money was paid 1
by the colle<3or into the bank, and the 1
the treasury drew upon the bank for the a- 1
mount. How then were the crowns to get
into the mint ? If the treasury had a fuffi
ciency of new coin to replace the foreign
coin, the business might be effefted, but not
otherwise, as all commerce must of csurfe j
stop, and the price of produce i mmediate- â¢
ly fall, if deprived of a circulating medium.
For instance, would the bank of Baltimore 1
be at the expenee of fending their French <
crowns to the mint, and wait till they could t
receive new dollars in exchange ? No man
would believe this. Banks were always 1
pushed for money, and dare not part with i
their circulating medium. With refpedl to t
crowns, it was not of so much importance t
as the gold coin ; if that vjere to be called J
in, he did not know what the banks would
doâthey could not wait till it was re-coin- e
ed ; they were rather borrowers than /
lenders of money. He knew of no bank 1
out of the city of Philadelphia which could
fend their foreign coin to the mint to be re- 1
coined, and wait its return. He did not *
know that they could. The Mint, be said, e
was flow in its movements. He knew an t
instance where a bank sent several thqufaud r
dollars worth of bullion to he recoined, and
they lay out of their property for fix or fe- 0
ven months. He supposed it might now be j
more expeditions ; but it would doubtless .
htf too flow for the wants of the banks.â
Suppose, said he, the plan could be carried j
into effeft, and the circulating medium was
wholly our own coin and Spanilh dollarsâ
â what would be the consequence ? It would
be thisâour own dollars, being of equal
finsnefs with the Spanish, would.be export
ed in common with them to the London and c
East India markets ; and.liuce it was known e
that foreign coin was not current here, mer- Â£
chants would import as little of it as they a
could avoid, so that our circulating medium a
would fooii be exhausted. He fhould,therefore, p
be in favour of the amendment of the gen
tleman from Virginia. t
Mr. Sswall said, the present question t
was not whether the circulation of foreign i:
coins should be prohibited altogether ; but n
whether that circulation should be a partial t
one. Some gentlemen seemed to think no
thing ought to be done with refpeft to gold t
coin ; but all were of opinion it would be e
necessary to allow Â»t least a partial payment a
It ,of fllvvr coin j and feme of gold coin. For
is j . his own part, h : \vas unwilling to postpone
- j the difficulty which mult be. encountered,
and which had already been felt in a great
t degree, whenever a partial stoppage should
n be pnt to the circulation of foreign coin. If"
, the law were to be suspended f<?r two years,
e as some gentlemen wished, he did not think
we fliould be much better prepared to carry
, it into effeft than at present. He did not
e think it possible to supply the mint of the
United States with bullion in any other way
3 than'by preventing the circulation of foreign
" c "' n \ were not, he said, in poflefiion
) of mines abroad, nor did we import much
: bullion ; but our commerce led us to import
a jCjinfiderable quantity of foreign coin, and
" fÂ° r e'gn coin of greater value in the country
r from whence it was imported, than it was
when it arrived here, which was owing to
I the exportation of coin being forbidden in
those countries, and there was no way of
1 importing it but by concealing it. On this
account, a four pillole piece, which in Bil
boa was worth sixteen dollars, was- here
worth no more than fifteen and a quarter ;
yet a merchant will bring this gold coin at
; this loss, rather than bring dollars, which,
being so much more bulky, would be liable
to be discovered, and risk the loss of (hip and
cargo. If foreign gold coin were out of
circulation altogether, he did not think
much inconvenience would be experienced ;
it was not current by tale, the weighing of
it was attended with much trouble, and he
thought it might very well be dispensed
with. And though it would not be receiv
ed as a legal tender, this would take little
from its value ; for a person would always
be able to pay a pound of gold for. what it
was really worth, and wbilft the mint was
in being, there would always be a ready
market for it. With refpeft to silver it was
different. It passed for more than its real
value. A crown, or dollar, though dimin
ished in weight, and consequently in value,
wou)d,pafi for a crown or a dollar. If the
circulation of foreign silver was altogether
stopped, the loss sustained by individuals
would be great ; but, on the other hand, it
was necessary to supply the mint, and it
was proper to flop the circulation of all fo
reign (ilvcr coin, except dollars and parts
thereof, which would not be attended with
any great inconvenience, as crowns and parts
thereof, bore, but a small proportion of the
foreign silver coin in circulation. Indeed,
the inconvenience had already taken place.
In the part from whence he came, the cir- '
culatLo of crowns had stopped, except is J
dollars, and they were paid without any .
great hesitation by the persons who had
them at that rate. Bat he did not think J
we were wholly prepared to meet this incen- I
venience. He, therefore, thought it would i
be right to agree to the report of the com- '
mitt**, which allowed them to be received
at the custom-house, which would, in a great f
measure, remedy the evil arising from their 1
being declared not to be a legal tender in J
other cases. Gentlemen had observed that f
the country would be more affedted by this c
regulation thau the cities ; but, as it had "
been before dated, if a crown was worth '
no cents in one place, it would not be '
worth much less in any other. The incon
venience would be of fliort duration, as the
crowns wonld all flow to those parts where
they were received current. This observa
tion had been opposed by a faft that bank
bills in the interior of the country pass at a
depreciated rate ; but he thought that the
analogy would not hold. If a person had
five crowns, and was obliged to expend one <
of them, before he had an opportunity of
getting the full value for them, he would j
lose only a few cents, but in a bank note of
five dollars, if he wanted make use of a -
dollar, he would l'uffer a loss upon the whole I
note. He hoped the report would be jgrÂ«ed
to.

Mr. Fehno,
Did Ibtlieve that therecognition-by Con-
I grefs, of the right of our merchants to arm ]
their vessels for defence again ft piracy in the
Weft Indies, and on our coast, involved ei
ther a (i open pr implicit declaration of di
rest hostility agaisft any particular nation 1
whatev<r, I should be as much opposed to
the raeafure as any citizen in the United ,
States, " A Friend to Laws and Freedom"
not exceptedr^âbut this not being the cafe
I am clearly of opinion that in the present
tituation of affairs the rjght of merchants t* 1
arm their veffds, Ihouldbe no longer restrain
ed. Especially when it is notorious that
the vessels which moflly annoy our commerce
are of so small a size and so conterpptibly
equipped that a few fwrvels or small arms,
on board one of.teuTjnercttantmen, with the
addition of four hands more than
the ordinary complement would save proper
ty to an immense amount from falling into
the hands of those, unparalelled monsters.
It is therefore vefy delirable that Congress
(hould speedily recognize the exercise of a
right, which may produce the belt effedls
i'd restoring our almost languished commeree
and console the merchants, who may be said
to be the principal support of government,
with a hope that the government they sup
port is not altogether indifferent as to their
luecefs. ,
The" FriendtoLawsandFreedom"feems
to think that the inconveniences by spoliati
ons on our trade, fall upon the inhabitants
of the nations at war, inasmuch as the con- 1
a fume* of Our produce pays for if. bt fVch an
enhanced value as to include the e;;t: lordi
-3 'nary charges of, freight, infura . -. 3rc: &Â£.
- Indeed it .would seem to be our real 'intei cft
- to encourage, rather than oppose the pirates,
whose depredations -according to hrt reason
" iag, tend' to enrich our merchants, under
- writers and (hip carpentersâbecause as the
1 price of our produce is enhanced to the CUI>-
r Aimer in a greater proportion than the dif
ferences of info raneeâand as the high pre
' miumsour ynderwritersrequire enables them
1 to lose one fourth of the property they in
, sureâand as it encourages our {hip carpen
-1 ter3 to be canftantly building vessels to
i supply the deficiency occafiooed by captures
the advantage is clearly in our favor, and
therefore why attempt to oppose or prevent
what is so admirably calculated to increase
our wealth and prosperity !
Mr. Fen no, the whole statement of a
Friend to Laws and Freedom, is a misrepre
sentation proceeding. I presume, not from
intention to deceive, but from want of cor
real information of the a&ually distressed si
tuation of our Commerce, the effedis of
which, (notwithstanding the encouraging
letters of Merchants in Europe, to induce
our adventurers to speculate on their markets
and put commifliohs in their pockets) are
too strongly proved by the fitnation of our
Prisonâthe pamphlet of Mr. Swanwiekand
our own knowledge of many, very many
Merchants who have been ruined by the pi
ratical career of French Marauders, to ad
mit of a doubt.
