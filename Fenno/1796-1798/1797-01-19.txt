It has routed the inhabitants, who, at the expense
of their reft, and rifle of their health, have watched
the property of rtieir neighbours during the long
nights, and the severity ef cold which has marked
this winter.
jr. I have long waited to fre some one of the peofftc
step ferward, and propose a plan tothe public, which
would secure property with less burthen than the
tt prefect general patrol.
It is prefumcd, the city police have it in their
or, power to tender the city mare secure, by ordering
daors to be fixed on all private alleys, by dirctting
them to be shut by a certain hour of the night, and
by levying a fine from all who aegleft or disobey.
The private alleys being tout, the patrofby the
c aid of the moon, or of the lamps, can view nearly
- one half square, or open alley. Add to this the
aid of horfas, whose feet fliould be muffled 10 pre
vent noise, hut in such manner, as not to /impede
vj. their speed. Under these circumstances, a tew
men, judiciously arranged through a city, would
>r, perform the whole bufinefi of the present numerous
train. In cafe of fire, these horfmen would inflantly
spread the alarm ; they could to the best advantage
ai range thelin > to supply water, or remove goods.
:d They would, at all times, be an excellent che:k so
the watchmen, and with ease take up or dispel the
night walkers.
This city or grand patrole (hould be veiled, by
the corporation, with certain powers, to enable
them to preserve order in the night. They would
form a fort of night magidracy. They should,
nevcrthelcfs, be accountable to the city police ; a
report by the mailer or captain of the corps, foi
the preceding night, should be by him filed ia the
mayor s office by 19 o'clock next day.
r Â» This grand patrol shall confill of the must refpea.
e able matters of families; they should have certain
le privileges and honors annexed to their office. Jt
will be proper that they have a certain badge or
le iymbol of their commission, by which they will be
able to detcdl and have impofters puoifhed. it is
e not supposed they will receive any pay, but it is 1
reasonable that the public stall defray their unavoid- :
j r able expenses ' I
4 The regulatiohs of this grand patrol, if not laid
0 down by the city police, should be approved by the I
t- mayor.
Their number mi/ be increased or diminiflied, as 1
prudenee rtiall direst ; but they (hould not, be abo- 1
Hllied, as the magistracy ef the city is not more im- '
portant than the

CONGRESS OF the UNITED STATES. (
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. <
â t
1 Tutfi'ay, January 3, concluded, (
Thereport ofthe cominiltee of Ways and Means '
h on the fubjedl of the balances due from indivi- c
dual States to the United States being under cÂ»o- t
ndcratioD.
â¢ The gentleman before him (Mr. Williams) said t hc 1
House would not give them time to make the ne- c
cefTary enquiries. Mr. Thatcher aflted whatenquiiies 1
were neccffary ? The gentleman seemed ta mifun- c
derfland the resolution. It was merely to givg no- Â£
'ice to the (late, to pay the debt, and did not pre !â¢
â  elude any reason which they might have te give "
why it should" not be paid. He hoped, therefore, a
no paflponement would take plactt, but that the re- v
solution would be agreed ta.
Mr. Murray said, the gentleman from Mafocbu- P
fctts (Mr* I hatshcr) had misunderstood him, if P
he thought he had aflerted that certain ttate* would "
be thrown out of the union if the resolution was en "
tered into. He thought hi had accompanied what
hi had said with such exprcffior.s as that he could "
not have been mistaken. His meaning was, that b
if the (late of Delaware, for instance, was obliged Â°!
to pay the debt due from her, added to her present
burthens, it would have the effcift to bear her down
so much as to deprive her of her political confe- ol
quence in the union. He disclaimed the other a '
idea. tl
Mi. Craik rose to make a potion, if in order, ar
to postpone the farther eonfitkiaiion of this ques
tion till next ftfiion. He wiflietl Â«hiÂ«, beeaul'e it cc
would give time fer cool deliberation. He was fu
surprised to hear gentlemen deny that the carrying fÂ°
of this measure into effe& was not likely to produce
warmth io the country. He thought the conduct Dt
of gentlemen in that House proved the contrary; th
for be thought they could net exped tl.at the peo- nc
pie whom they represented wonld be more cool ob nc
the fubjcA than they were. The cenfidcratien of
this warmth, he said, operated ia his mu.d against
taking up the business at all. Gentlemen said they ln
did not mean to take any coercivc meafurcs, but only bc
to make the demand; but did they not know that
whertfhe demand had been made, they mud enforce S'
the payment, or shew they bad nut th. power of
doing so ? so
Mr. c. thought the date of Delaware, though it
had scarcely been mentioned, would be more par- wl
tievi arly affe&ed by a payment of the balances in wl
qiiellior. than any other.. The state of New-York,
he said, was fully able to pay ; but the fame could bu
not be said of Delaware. Indeed when, he saw *ei
New-York unwilli-g and Delaware unable to pay th:
I these balances, as a repr.efentative of Maryland who lio
| was a fmali debtor, he could not consent to the vir
. payment of that debt, wheÂ« thef'e seemed te be no pa
probability ef enforcing payment from other wh
Uates. th(
He hoped, therefore, the House weuld agree fhc
that this wa* not the proper time ta make the ap- fin<
plication ia queflion, and vote for a poflponcment me
till next session. wa
Mr. lfaac Smith said, if he understood the mea- " s
sure, it was to inform the dates, that there was [ eis
such a sum of meney stood charged against them, or
Theic was no thicat iu the resolution; and if they I the
â bad any obje&io:. tÂ« mike to the demand, they
would then make tliem. He had no objection to
the notice being expmffed in as mild terms as pofli
Â«. | We. The oppoliiioii te> the refolutiou was as warm,
;ht he said, as it it carried an execution along with it.
of He thought this warmth be withheld, at
f e . least, for the prefer*.
in- Mr. Livingfton said there seemed to be a mistake
ty. as to the language of the resolution. If it went
nfe no further than a notice, it would not be objc&iun
led a ble ; but it was accompanied wirh a lequelt. Lr
, B g payment. Mr. L. went again into arguments to
:ed thew the necessity of a postponement, in order to
an investigation of* the bufiuefs.
jf| e A member enquired what was the quefiion.
ieh Ibe speaker said the question was for a poftpone
he went for three weeks. The gentleman from Ma,
rylaad had moved to pcftpone till next session,
eir whish was not in order ; a day certain mutt be
i,g mentioned, and even that would not be in order,
ng except fecondfd, which was not the cafe with the
nd gentleman's former motion.
Mr. Craik then moved and the motion was fe
he ceuded, to postpone the quettion until the firlt
rly Monday in December next.
he Mr. Gallatin said, there seemed to be three dif
re. ferent grounds upon which a postponement tvit ur
de Red, The firft was, on an insinuation that some
:w fort ef agreement had taken place, when the sums
i!d doe to the creditor ftajes were funded, that the ba
ius lances due from the debtor fates were to be reliu
tly quiftied. So far fn>m this taking place, Mr. G.
ge said, a motion te this efFefit had been made and Be
ds. gatived at that time, by the yeas and nays being ta
an ken upon it, jg to 28. He was hurt, therefore,
he lo bear of this infinuatinn. The next ground for
a poftpenement was toundedon a suspicion that the
by fettleinent made by the commissioners was not just.
)) e He said he was net going to express ai Â« opinion
ild whether the fettlemeut was a just one or not 5 Â»he
d, thcr the rules adopted by the cdmroiffioncrs were
a good er not ; whether the mode of Hating the ac
o, counts had been the best. It was delirable that a
lie private ihculd take place, and though it
fell hard on some, it was not the Ids defirablc ; but
J. supposing, however, that any of the debtor ftatcs,
in or any state, had a right to object to the settle
ment, to the jurisdiction of the commissioners, aad
er "f congress, and were not to be bound except by
be the judges of the supreme court, thi* proper time
i s te have wade these objections was when the bill for
i s funding the balances of the creditor Hates pafied,
J. for that was the time of carrying the settlement in
to execution.
id Why, therefore, said Mr. G. there should he a
le poftponemcnt of three weeks to enable the New-
York members to fend to their fate, he did not
al know. They had had time enough ; and he
â¡- thought the bufmefs would have been better danc
n . three years ago than now.
The arguments adduced by the gentleman from
Maryland (Mr. Murray) seemed to have weight ;
_ that to carry the measure into effed might create
confufion j and that we had not power over the
Hates to enforce payment. As to the danger of
cotifufion, there was as much on the one fide as
the other ; becjufe those Itatcs which were to re
ceive benefit from the payment by the debtor dates
13 would have as much cause te complain if these
i- debts were not paid, as tbofe debtors being obliged
j- to pay what they owe, could have.
The only ground, then, was the want of power
ie to coerce the dates, and this, he owned, appear
.. Ed te be ltrong. Yet this ground was rather againlt
, 3 the resolution itfelf. It was better, he said, ta
<l ult the whole bulinefs at once, than to paftpene ;
thaa to leave the subject to irritate the minds of the
people ta no purpose. If it were pottponed till
e next fei&on, the pcoplÂ« would be operated upoa by
a fear " f haviu K th e money to pay ; and the fates
, who owed it, would also remain diflatisfied.
Mr. G. thought, therefore, it wuuld be belt te
_ put thequeftioi), and to fee whether they had the
f power in doubt or not. Rather than adopt any
, resolution to peftpene, he would cancel the busi
ness altogether.
, He would lay a word as to coercion. He did
, not fee any pewer they had over the fates, except
[ b y attaching any of their prepi'rty. He few no
j other way in which they could lay hands oÂ» a fate.
. Nor was this owing to the weakness of our govern!
i mcnt ( a 8 " been insinuated.) This settlement
of accounts was a remnant of the old government,
. and had nothing to do with the present ; for now,' \
their power was to be exercised over individuals'
and not over fates. 1
' As to the resolution itfelf, if they went into a '
. commit{ee ef the whole, he mijrht perhaps make '
furne observations upon it. He had been at a loss '
to know why this fubjed had not been entered ]
; into before, ana why it should .be brought forward
now. With refpeA to the notification, he believ- 2
the fates had already been notified. As it w Â«ld 1
not be in order however to gÂ» info the fubjeft <. c . '
nerally, he had eonfiued himfclf to tbe queitioÃ "ef '
pndponemeiit. "
Thequeftion for postponing to the firft Monday [
in December, was then taken and negatived, there 1
being only 37 votes for jt. / (
For three week* was Wxtppurt r and negatived ;
51 to 29. ' 1
I On motion o. Mr. Cooper, the quellion was put |
for one week, and negatived by the fame members [
Thequeftion for going ioto a committee of the 11
whple on the fubjeft, was theu put and carried, b
when S
Mr.-Van Allen said he wished to fimplify tad "
bufinefsas much as pollible. He believed it was a
very important te convince the state of New-York t<
that the settlement had been made upon fair and &
honorable principles; because if they were eon- n
vinced of this, they would Jiave no objections to Â®
pay the debt; but, knowing the general fcutiments C<
which prevailed in, that state of the unfairnefs of
the tranfafiion, he was desirous that some step rr.
(hould be taken which would serve to adjust the bu- V
finefs. He thought he held in his hand an amend
ment which was calculated to have that effect. It
was as followsâToiÂ»fert after the word " indeed"
" and that the proceedings bf the said commission
ers shall be open fer the infpeftien of such agent fn
or agents as the said debtor states, or either of th
them, (ball appoint to iiifpcft the fame." ct
t) | 'Mr. H.ip t beKeved :h.r (lie 'Iftnzn who
to brought tortfard this would have ber.i
si the last to have dotie so, li lie had fcen all the mlf
n, chiefs which wodd be cwufequent upon carryÂ»
it. injf it inte effect. It wsuld be to undo all
at that bad been dons with the greatest la.
and with the greatest difficulty, for three
te yea'rs ; and what he asked would be the conte
nt quence ! Were they to te-fettle the business and
n- consume two or three more year 9in the affair, tlieic
or would be no security that New-York, or'fome o
to ther Hate, would not be diffatislied. so that there
to would be no end of such a business. He was of
the number of those who wilhed to have parte | hy
this fettlcment at p'efent altogether ; but the ma
e- jority had said, we will have a decilion. Lart them
a, make one. If be was called upon to vote upon
n, tjie refolutisn, he believed he fliould voie against
ae it ; -but, at all events, he fhouid dcprecate more
r, than any other peffibic course, the ripping up of
ie tUii> long dlfpute.
Mr. Williams spoke at fo'tiC length in favor of
e- his colleague's motion, and Mr. W. Smith laid a
ft few words agaiult it, when it was put and Rsga
tived, there bein# only 10 for it.
f- Mr. Macon then said that the United States had
r- been the cause of entreating the debts oftheftatea
ie by assuming the state debts, some of which were
is nost half, others not a quarter of the sum assumed.
j. Mr. Locke alio spoke a few words on the hard
j. (hip of the cafe of "North Carolina, who had made
I. three times greater exertions in the war thais fume
of her neighboring dates, who were made credi*
t tars, and yet they were brought in debtors.

they ought to pay the penalty and that if thÂ«# hÂ»uK

, that he understood the cases of ti.eie petitioneis
. were hard ones, having had some conversation with
j the distriCt Attorney on the fubjea, at lealt,
the petition ought to have a reference, since, if ths
committee of commerce and manufactures (or a lelcif

proper) saw no reason to make an exception against the
law, in favour of these peiit;uncrs, and he believed it

report would be very summary, anc consume but little
of the time of the house.
A reference Was denied by a great majority.
Mr. Harrifon presented a petition of Lucy Clerk
praying for payment of money due to her late iulband*
a director of artillery in the late war. This petit,on
having been decided upon last feflion, some ckieftioas
were made to the referring of it again, but, on tlw
ground of new cvldencc they were over ruleÂ®, and it
was referred to the committee otcUims.
Mr Blount moved that the petition of Richard
Blackley, with a s report thereon which had not been
aiiled upon.be referred to the committee of claims.

Mates, for payment of the balance due from that state
in the fettlcment otthe eommiffioners, to the United
states, i his motion occafioncd conliderable debate,
and was negatived 41 to 35.~-.The house then went in
to a committee of the whole on the fubjeel, when a
amilar motion was introduced in the form of lu araCnd
ment by Mr Sitgrcaves, and negat,veu 4, to 30. The
original resolution was at length put and carried by a
conquerable majority, there being 5 ! j,Â« t e, i n it, fa.
vour. The committee ther. rose, and on motion for
the house to take up the i.ufir.efs, a motion for adjourn,
menc was made and carried.
When the house was about to form itfelf into a
committee oPthe whole, on the fubjeft of the
balances due from individual ltatcs to the United
States, *
Mr. Nicholas rose and said, though the propo-
Ik ion he had made the other day was at that time
thought improper, he was more'and more convin.
ced of its piopiietjr. He thsught the courfc pro.tpafed to be takes by the repÂ»rt which had been
-M ie wa, not the Left ; he thought they were
va'urtmg oppnfitioi,, and giving the Hate of New-
Yt.rk an ..pportunity of embodying its opposition,
io -,st > make it dangerous to attempt, if it (hoald
lis rafter be thought necessary, to enforce the pay
mijnt of the balance in question. He believed the
J .ited States had it in their power at present to do
themselves justice ; but were the United States to
Jay their hands on the funds of the state of New-
York as a feennty for ,heir debt, there would be
nMhrng left to operate upon the minds of the peo
pie of that state, but the justice of the measure,
as they would no longer fofter any idea of evading
the debt. He could fee no obje&ion to this pro
ceedmg".
If there was danger of a serious conflict with
that state, in order to recover this debt, he for one
would chtife to reiiiiqm'Ch it altogether ; but if they
were to pay themselves by laying bold of 'heir
stock, he believed that state would acquiefee in the
Hic.iftire, and there would 110 more be heard of it
*hich might not be the cafe if they made a de'
matid, and weie to wait for objections or a refufal
ot payment. From the zeal which had been iliewn
by the gentlemen from New-York on this occasion,
he aflcef if it wÂ©nld be extraordinary if that state
(hould put it out of their power to do themselves
justice ; and whether wnsn the opposition to the
demand (hould be drawn into a focus, it would not
be encreafed in iis force He thought there could
be no doubt of it.
There was one objeftiontoa proceeding of this
kiÂ»d that might have some weight. It might be
fuid, for inftanee, that the state from whence he
came, or others, might refufe to pay, after they
had distrained upon the funds of New-York fur
their debt. It might be so. He believed that one
of the debtor (fates could never pay. This was
no reason why they (hould no: receive the debt from
New-York. They might nevertheiefs allow so
much from the amount as fhouJd be equal to the
deficiency in the payments of the otiier states.
He thought to adopt this plan would be to avoid
any disagreeable cooflift which might otherwise
take pbee, and be a means sf prefervinjr harmony i
between that state and the United States. He !
therefore prapofed a refolutien to the following ef
fectâwhich he wi(hed to be committed to the lame
committee of the whole to was referred the
report of the committee ef ways and means on this
fubjeift.
Resolved, That the balances due from certain
lUtes in the settlement of accounts between indivi
dual state* and the United Sta-es, shall be dischar

the public debt of the United States, and that th'e ]

? OFFICIAL DETAILS.
ARMY of the RHINE and MOSELLE.
Extract of a letter from the General in Chief, Moreau I s
to tl)e Executive Diredory.
Upon the 27th of this manth the right wing
was attacked in the pasTes if'Enfer, St. Pie. re, and
St, Msrgen. Ihe advanced guard was oblige !to
fall back, but the main body prtferved its pofiti6n.
The pass was guarded, and the enemy wera unable rl
to blnck it up.
" gave orders again to attack the enemy next V
day. Ihe centre of the army was to support this
attack by a detachment which followed tits route
of the pass of Simonsvvald. 'p
" U POÂ» the 28th, Prince Charles, who had coo
centrated his whole aimy in the neighbourhood of
Elfach and Effingen, attÂ«c-ked the adv.mced guard
Â£f the centre and that of the left. The latter were M
to fall batk upon tbe army, but that of the centre
was vnder the neceflity of making head in its. po
sition, in order to pretcit the return of its detach-'
Â»nent in the Simonfwakl.
" That of the left was to fall back behind the
Elft upon the firft; attack of Reutuengen, which
it occupied by the bridges of AnwafTen and The
ningew ; but the brave general Beaupeuis, who had
the command of this movement, w.,s killed at the
beginning of this so that the detachment
continued to fight in tne bad position which tt oc-
cupied till new orders could be giver, and all their
bravery was requisite to prevent them from being Â£ u
driven in by a superiority of force, and numerous 'r
artillery.
" After this engagement, in which, fortunately, 1
wi. did not lose a single piece hf artillery, the army
preftrved its position behind the Elft ; the right me

were ready to seize the passes at all the other points,
had they succeeded in forging this one ; but their
efforts were useless, and their attacks, which they
continued to repeat with frefh troops from tea

Uoard the privateer, and I suppose sent to the Capeâl
the pray God you had Insurance made, as I wrote by three

re- rhe reason given for taking us is, that we were

bound to or from British ports.
The fame privateer has f.-nt into this port a brig

< j ; NEW-YORK, January 17. â 
ih our P a P cr of yesterday, the reader will ob
fo f f rvea note at the foot of the article of eftiiuate*
m and duties, of this kind: Â« More than half the
whole revenue of the United States, arifiag from
impolt and tonnajfe, is paid by the state* of New-
York and Fennfylvania."
Wt *i(h our readers to understand that that
note did *9/ originate with the editors of the MiÂ»
nerva. It was copied from another paper, and"
could have proceeded only from inattention in the
5 publishers. We IhouM not now have -Noticed the
I* alley ion, had not similar ideas fallen from a mem.
' ber of Congress in a late debate on the balance* f
and did not inch aflertions frequently occur in the
'â¢ commercial states by way of boasting.
1 The truth is, more than half the revenue is ctJ.
e hSed in tlie ports of Philadelphia and New-York :
hut the duties are paid by all the (tatej in the Uni
on. Philadelphia imports, not only'for her near
" neighbors# but for all the foathcrn states. New.
" York imports largely for the southern states, and
wholly for her adjacent neighbors. Mere dry good*
are carried from New-York up Conne&icut river,
' than up the Hudson. The consumers on that riÂ»
* ver, including Conne&icut, Hampshire county,
* in Maflachufetts, and part of Vermont and New-
Hampshire, amount to almost 4.00,000 fouls, a po
' pulation equal to that of the whole state of New
| York, and the richest people and the most liberal
: consumers of luxuries, that are in America. Not
to mention a large portion of New-Jersey, which
are dependent on New-York merchants for supplies.
It is very deniable that the citizens of the Ame
rican republic (hould lay aside ths little narrow
views of local advantages, aud think themfelve*
members of one great community. Of what con
ference is it whether the duties on goods are paid
on this fide or the other, of a* imaginary line ? lo
an inhabitant of New York or Albany, happier or
letter, he lives in a date where cuftoma aiÂ«
colle&ed, than the citizens of Newark or Burling,
ton, who are separated from the colle&ing port bf
a large rivet ? Americana ought to be ashamed of
naming such diltinAions. Minerva.]
COMMUNICATIONS.
Some members of a certain body, have
tically hinted, that the Frcnch directory, ought to
make war upon the United States. They have aat,
said indeed, that they wiil openly join France*
(hould it come to a qdarrcl; but it is yet to be fees
whether thiy do not mcaa to prostrate their Â«oua>
try before the French direAory, by withalding
from it the meana neccflary far an honorable nego
tiation.
You have seen â¢ cock upon a dung-hill ia fearck
of food ; with what industry th fcratche* it, witk
what earnellnefi he esamioei every layer of filth aÂ»
he turns it over ; and how beflrutsaad crow* when
he finds a grain of half rotten corn to devour juSt

joint as welt as separate property of the said Gentle
men, is, and ought to be, liable. And whereas
it is clearly and fatitfa&orilv af'ctrtained, that mr.
Blair ypClenachan, of the faic! firm, has conveyed
away to mr. John H. Hujlor, his son-in-law, to his
daughter, miss M'Clenacban, and to his son, George
APClenachan, several large and valuable real estates,
as well aÂ» considerable personal property, in the city
and csnnty of Philadelphia, in the county of Lancas
ter, in the county of New-Callle Delaware, ind
elsewhere, with a view, as it is apprehended, to de
feat the Creditors in the recovery of their just debts.â
This is, therefore, to forewarn all persons whomso
ever, against the purchase from the said grantees, or
either of them, of any portion of the said real or per
sonal property, as the molt vigorous measures will
without delay be taken to render the fame liable to
the jtrtt demands of the Creditors.
By order of the Creditors.

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caution introduced into the public prints,
waruing all pcrfonr against purchaiiog from the
grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and petfonal estates he conveyed away to
his fon-in law and to hit children waÂ» the result of
a deliberation had upon the fubjedt by a general and.
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachin and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trull confided in the fubferiberg by
those creditors : a step which it would have been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitterl.
The very ftatecnent of the fadt therefore must dis
pel the imputation that it was" either " precipitate
.or viÂ«di&ive." It originated in a defne to leoure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fan&ioned by the
advice of council as a measure necejfary to the lafety
of the creditors. If the advertisement hat been
injurioÃS to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own Hnjaftifiable conduA, not to the fub
feiibers who have merely puWilhad the truth is
terms as mild as the fa& would admit, and wlio
mean to invefiigate in a high court of justice the
validity of tho(e purchases of which Mr. M'Cle
nachan so confidently speaks.
The fubfcriUers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
caution againtl purohaling of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
purchase from any other persons (if fuck there be)
to whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
conveyances.

carefully and cxptfditioully broke, for everjy purpose, and
made obedient,tot he will of the rideis ; the natural powers
which are shut up in them, will be unfolded by art, calling
forth uniformity ot motion, and giving to that noble animal
aM thole beadties of attion which providence has so bounti
fully be (lowed on them.
Also, it his hospital, every disorder to which the horse is
