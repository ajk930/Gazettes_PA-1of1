CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY MARCH t6.
Mr. Brooks presented a petition on be
half of James Perry, for compenfarion for
property taken from him during the war,
for the use of the army, which, after a num
ber of objections 011 the ground of its being
a claim ef the fame nature with many others
which were daily rejected, was referred to
the committee of claims;
Mr. Macon, from the committee of revi
fal and unfinifhed business, made a farther
report, {taring that a part of the law ref
peftiug poft-offises and post-roads, would
expire fajfore the next feflion of Congress.
âThistepdrt was reftrred to the commit
tee on the fubjedt of poft-offices and post
roads, tÂ« report by bill or otherwise.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
claims, made a leport on the petition of
Jane Hardin, praying for compensation for
the maintenance of two Shawanefe Indian
girls, on accouut of the United States.
The report dates, that if the fads were as
mentioned, there is no need of legislative in
terference, as an application to the Secreta
ry of War, will be effectual. Of courfc no
decifioa of the house was necessary on the
Feport.
On motion of Mr. Sewall, the house
went into a committee of the whole, on the
bill making an additional appropriation to
provide and fuppcrt a naval armament, Mr.
Dent in the chair, when, the bill having
been read,
Mr. "3cwall moved to fill . the *P* [f
prrtpriating money for the pay an " .
ciÂ«. for the term of one of he of. rel
fleers and crews, with 2 I 6,679 u " "'
Some objection. had beep made t. the f>nÂ« Â«
at which the tat ion. had been fixcd ' v '. P
the fubjrft waÂ« formerly before the H â¢ P
He had, inconfeq,ence.madeenqu,,K on ed
the fubÂ«a, and had been informed that 28 fc
center ration was the Weft price at wh.ch th
thev could be obtained. _
Mr. Gallatin a(ked, whether the gentle- C
'man', enquiry had extended to th* _ price
paid for rations to the troops ftat!o,ied in the
forts, other, than those on fn Â» n, ' e '*' .
The contrafl for these would be the belt da- er
ta for the price to be allowed in th^ a[e - .
Mr. St wall did not think it neftffary to .n
make thil esquiry.
The qu'eftion was put and ca"ied.
Mr. Sewall then moved to fill the blank
to defray ihe wear, losses, expenditures o. m
ammunition, and other contingent ex- t
pences, with 63,7Â®0 dollars. r.
Mr. Gallatin said, the estimate before fe
him fer contingent expences was6o,ooodol- w
lars. There were 3,700 dollars for othbr tl
fpecifie purposes, vil. for the salaries of g,
clerks, and for the rent of the naval yards at a:
different places. He thought it would be v.
best to distinguish betwixt contingent ex- I
pences and salaries, and also whether the a
clerka were authorized by law, or whether ti
they were established by this bill. If the c
efiicers were already eftablilhed, the salary o
would be provided by law ;if not, th* l* w c
(hould be palled to eitablifli the office. t
Mr. St wall said, that whilst there re
mained en hand materials which had been t
pnrchafed for the use of the frigates at New- c
York, Portsmouth and Norfolk, it would \
be necessary to have persons there to tajce v
care of them, HÂ« supposed the clerks were t
authorised by law. . 1
Mr. Gallatin said, if the clerks were c
authorized by law, their falafies would be I
included in the ordinary appropriations; he
therefore movftl to fill the blank with I
Â§o,coo dollars, as the items which were I
mentioned separately, could not properly be f
included under the head of repairs and con
tingent expeiices of the naval armament, as 1
this related to the three frigates only, and
not to the taking care of any materials on
band. '
Mr. J. Parker hoped this motion would
be agreed to, and the* other withdrawn.
The clerks employed at the places which
had been raightat present be ne
cessary; but he thought fomeprovifionought
to be made with refpedt to the disposal of
these materials, in order to do away the ne
cessity ofemploying persons tp take care of
them.
Mr. Sewall withdrew his motion, aÂ«d
' that far filling the blank with 6c,0i0 was
carried.
Mr, Gallatin then moved to add the fol
io wing, words, " alfo,that a fuui not exceed
ing 2,200 dollars, ta pay the salary of per
' sons having charge of the Â«a,val yards at N.
" York, Portsmouth arid Norfolk, and the
5 rents of the fame," which motion was car
ried*
Mr. Varnam moved to strike out the
words "far sea, with all convenient speed."
* Hg ito&l'lrfcffl'tfie Tugatettolea, at
" any rate, with all convenient speed, though
" the occasion for doing this might flepeld
> upoÂ« some future consideration.
Mr. Isaac Parker laid, the only natural
' eonftrudtion of these words was, as to the
manner in which the vessels were to be e
' quiped. It did not follow, that when they
" were equipped, they would be sent to sea,
except there was a necessity for it.
Mr. J. Williams thought the words im
> material; if they would produce any effedt
' in accelerating the business, he thought
3 they ought to be retained, as all allewed it
J had heretofore been fuflciently tardy.
e Mr. Gallatin said, the law of la(l ftffion
" went *0 farther than to diredt the vessels to
'' "be " manned and employed whÂ«rea3 this
" bill, though only makiag an additional ap
propriation to enable the PreGdent to carry
* the formeV law iato effedt, feemcd to go far
' ther. It appeared to diredt, that they
0 (hould "be equipped for sea with all conve
r aient speed," whilst the former law left it to
the diferetion of the President to employ 1
them as he pleafcd. 1 If it were widled that
the business ftiould be left oa its former foot
ing, these words might with propriety be
ftruak owt; because, after the money was
appropriated, the President might use what
v speed he pleased in equipping. tUe vessels.
Mr. Harper said, it would seem that the '
gentleman froÂ» Pennsylvania did not know
- the difference bet wees preparing the vessels
r for sea, and employing them after they are
, prepared. He was persuaded, however, he
- did know the difference. Though that
% house had not the power to diredt how the
s vessels fhpuld be employed, yet they could
J diredt them to be prepared with all conve
nient speed. It was the business of that
'- house to prepare, and <Â»f the PreGdent to
r employ 5 but the object of this motion went
*- to (hew that they were both the fame thing,
d Much complaint had been made, aid justly,
i. at the great delay which had taken place in
:- this business, and he could now fee no ob
ft jedtion, therefore, to directing them to be
equipped with all convenient speed. When
if they were equipped, the PreGdent would
f use them in fucb a way as the state of the
ir country (hall require. If the legislature
11 ohofe to put the eountry in a state of war,
J. the vessels would be employed accordingly ;
is or if it remained in peace their employment
1- would acgord with such a state. He hop
-- ed therefore, the words would be retained,
o Mr. Sewall said, the fame words were
e contained in the refolutien upon which the
bill was founded, and in the aft of 1796, a
fc similar cxpreffion was used. He thought
e the gentleman from Pennsylvania had not
o fufficiently attended to the diftinft appro
iv priations contained in the bill.
S Mr. Day ten (the Speaker) said the law
of last feCorv *ent farther than it was con
.
, 0Tp 1,.Â« bytoMUtogo. Â«
â¢Â« equip far lea with all Tpeed,
related' Oily to the manner in which the
vessels were to be equipped, as it was well
known that equipping for sea, and eqmp
ping for guard (hips (which was the fo.e
purpof* for which some gentlemen had with- m
ed them to be employed) was wholly <Jit- b<
fcrent The law of last fefion went to iay p(
they (honldbe manned and employed, which t ;
he believed, with the gentleman from S. c ]
Carolina, was an unnecefTary and improper â
dirtotion, as the President of the United t(
States, being the commander in chief, was t:
the the only proper judge of' the manner of ],
employing them.
Mr. Thatcher did not thiak that direft
ing t/he velTels to be equipped with all conve- v
nient speed, indicated any great haste, but
the contrary. b
Mr" Varntim 1 said, gentlmen ha<3, on for- p
mer occalions been very tenacious of giving 5
the President diretlion; ho-v he (hould adl, f,
He was unwilling to do it on the tne pre- v
sent occ.tfioo ; and he thought if these words ;
were ft ruck out, no one would understand t
that the frigates were ta be fitted out as ]
guarJ-Jh'ips. But if the bill was agreed to
as it now flood, he was of opinion that it a
would appeav to their constituents, that the t
Legislature believed the crisis was arrived ,
at which it was necessary to sent out frigates
to sea against a foreign nation. If this peri- t
cd was arrived, he wished it to be declared J
openly, and not in any fideway. Such a
claufts way veiy unusual in an appropriation (
bin. . 1
Mr. Gallatin believed it was pcrfeotly
true, as stated by the gentleman from Maffa- .
chufetts, that woids of this kind were ne
ver inserted when an appropriation was onl)
wan ed. In the law of 1796, he admitted J
that similar words were tifed, and, there they
were proper, because that was a law for the
conftruftion and equipment of the frigates ,
but in all the subsequent laws, which were
merely appropriation laws, no such words
had been used. This was not intended to
fay that the moneyJheald it granted with all
convenient speed. 'He believad, iincc they
were t6 be equipped, the fooncr they were
done'the better ; but he did not think it pro
per to insert such a clause in an appropria
-1 tiou bill.
Mr. Bayard thonght the gentleman from
I Pennsylvania made a nice diftin&ion with
â  out a difference. He admitted that if the j
bill was for conftru&ing the frigates, such
â  words might be proper, but that in an ap
: propriation bill they were improper- He
f saw no difference between the two cases ;
- and if it was the of the Hoafe to have ;
F the frigates equipped speedily, it was cer- 1
tainly not improper to fay so, and in hiÂ»
1 opinicfn the situation of the country requir
s ed that every exertion should be made in
the business. i
The question was then taken on striking
â¢ out tfye words, " with all convenient speed"
â¢ (the mover having agreed to exclude the
â¢ words " for sea" from his motion) and was
e negatived 47 to 38.
The committee then rose, the house a
greed to the amendment, and the bill was
6 ordered to be engrossed for a third reading
" to-day were mentioned for the
I firfl: taken on thT'mofl eiiltant" iday, and ne-1
h gatived 43 to 42. It was accordingly order
d ed to be read a third time this day, Before
the heufe rose, it received its third reading
and passed, therebeing $7 votes in its favour
e Mr. J. Parker proposed a resolution to
" dire&ing the committee which
Y had been appointed to enquire into the ex- :
'â¢ penditureof the money heretof#re appropri
ated for a Naval Armament, and into the
l " causes of delay which had taken place, to
enquire and report what materials remain j
II on hand which will not be wanted for the j
' three fiigates now nearly finifted, designa
ting what the articles are, an<f where they
a . are ; and also what materials have been
0 disposed of, which was agreed to.
18 On motion of Mr. N. Smith, the house
>_ went into a committee of the whole on the
y bill fupplemeatary to, and in alteration of
r * the aft for the relief of persons imprifwied
y for debt, when the bill having been read,
Mr. J. Williams moved to ftrijee out the
0 firft feftion of the bill. He was persuaded
Y that if this bill passed, it would be very in
lC jurious to the revenue, and in the end pre
judicial to the fair trader, for if such a law
,c had been in bting the last year, government
lS would have 101 l half a million of money, and
11 if such losses were sustained, it would lead
to the pafiiug of laws which woulrlbe inju
le rious to commerce. It became the house
J* to ba cautious, therefore, in making altera
ls tions which might so matei ially affeft the
re revenues of the union ; especially as the de
le bentures given by the Custom house must
" be allowed, whether the duties are ipaid or
18 not.
This motion was negatived without a
s " division.
After the bill had undergone several a
niendments, one of which was to provide
U that the benefits of this law shall not ex
?' tend to persons imprisoned for debts due
for money by them received for, or on ac
count of the United States, the . committee
3 rose, and had leave to fit again.
Mr. Clopton, from the committee of En
â " rolment, reported as duly enrolled, the bill
to amend the aÂ£ laying a duty on stamped
lc vellim, parchment and paper, and the bill
re for relief of Sylvanus Crowell.

LONDON, Dec. a.
DESCENT on ENGLAND.
The meant of obtaining ten nilH-.ns of livres,
for the ccnJlruÃ'ion of a thousand er mire
Shan a thousand gun-beats.
Pitt proposes t<Â» raise the sum of seven
million.-sterling (161 millions Toumois) for
the year 1798, by tripling the assessed taxes
According to his calculation, there are in
Eagland 11400,000 houses. The number
of pef&wÃ upon -whom taxes fall, it>< hiding
men, women, and children, he eftimatuÃ at
abÂ«rut seven millions and a half. He fays,
that, of 1,400,060 houses, about seven or
right hundred thousand pay assessed taxes;
the others being miserable cottages, pay no
thinp at all : the seven millions, therefore,
he proposes to raise by tripling the
jfieffetT taxes, will fall at the rate of ten
pounds sterling (240 livres Teurnois) upon
each house He fooliftily Relieves that this
resource is fufficiant ta prevent France from
making a defeent.
Having thus stated the question on one
fide, it remains to treat it in the other point :
of view, in which it ought to be coniidered i
by this country-.
Our objeft at present is a d<fcÂ«*t: there
is no other made by which to subdue the
English government, and to put an end to
its tyranny. We are in poffcjionof all the
requisite means, except that of passing the i
little arm of the sea that separate. France;
from England. But, as our objetft is not to ;
umbat the English fleet, but to tjcape it, onr
mode of tfavigating-ought to be such as that !
rhe English leet cannot obftrn& our voy
age
Every one knowsthat there aretwo mode,
of navigationâfailing and rowing. We 1
also know thatveffelswi'th fails mufl regulate
tjieir course fey the wind ; but, that hosts :
with oars may be moved iu every (Hre&ion, j
and with the greatest- facility, when there is !
no wind at all. j
Thus the mpft certain, and the lead ex- '
pen five means of pading irrro StighTnj,~in"l
spite at the Engliih fleet, are to employ
revv-boats, having a small fail, like the
Dutch fifhiyg-boats, to serve upon oecafi
on.
If the French coasts were five or fix hun
dred leagues difcant from those ef England,
it would be very ridiculous to talk of row
boats ; but in many places, there are no '
more than eight, ten or twelve leagues be
tween them ; and so the mod diflant parts
where we could think of making adefcent, f
there are no more than forty or fiftv leagues, |i 1
which may be passed in forty-eight hours, i 1
even without the aid of fad., on the fuppo- ' 1
fition that the boats can row at the rate of I I
a league an hour. ,
The Ruffians transport their troops in <
nw-boats across the Black Sea. The
Swedes transport their's. in the fame man
ner, to the most distant part 6 of the Swed
ish empire. The Ruffian can tranf- !
port two or three hundred soldiers each, and '
fix men ire pnt upon one oar. But for 3
making a descent upon England, boats of a c
smaller size ought to be preferredâThe sea I
on many parts of the English coast does
not often iÂ«n r i-- I
therefore, go close in (hore, and the troops
land as easily as persons step out of a vrber- r
nr.
The espence of the English navy for the
year 1798. according to Pitt's budget, is 1
12,500,000!. sterling, or 300,000,000 of a
livres Tournois. To aover this enormous 8
expence,- he proposes to triple the assessed
taxes, whieh will trffce, at an average, 240
livres from each family. France wants on- ,j
ly 1000 gun-boats, which will cost no more 1
than ten millions Tournois. To raise. this d
sum, no new impost is neceflary : it will be :1
better to obtain it by patriotic gifts.
Citizen Villeri,has already listed, in the
Council of Five Hnndred, that many per- t j
sons had expressed their desire of contribul- ti
ing voluntarily to the expence of a defceat t)
ipan England. I love the patriotic spirit f
of these worthy citizen. ; and as I desire to v
contribute my mite towards this important
measure, I have contrived a plan which will
enable every citizen to participate in the r,,
honar of destroying a government, which,
for more than a century,has been the fcoargc
of the human race. '
The sum I would propose to raise by pa- a '
triotic gifts is, ten millions of livres, ta be "
employed, undet the dire&ion of the ga
verument, in building a thousand, or more, r
gun boats. Â» al
As it i 9 better rather to under rate than m
to exaggerate our means iu a calculation of
â thjs kind, I shall estimate the population of w
France at only 25,000,000 though her in
crease of territory must make the number an
considerably greater. I believe it will be he
found, that the men of twenty and upwards re
form about one fifth of this population ; lei
that is to fay, 5,000,000. One half of P a
these five millions, 2,500,000, I shall Cup- ll "
pose, are the industrious poor, from whom J f
the will rtiuft betaken for the deed: I di- an
vide, then,_the remaining two millions and I>a
a half into two classes of 250,000 each,and pa
and four classes of 500,000 each. The de
greatest patriotic gift, according to my cal- rs '
cuktioii, fliould be 12 livres, and the small
est 20 sols. Each person should have the
liberty of causing his name to be inferibed j n
in any class he may think proper. If a ci- m<
tiztn of small fortune wishes ta inferibe his
name in the firft. class, and a rich man in that of
of>>2o sols, they ought both to be permitt- ; co '
ed to-do so :it is equality of rights, not of i "
fortune,which is the real principle off quality. I J

MONBAY EVENING, MartL 19

I*- ' The following message from the PreCdent of
â  the United State*, was read in the House
of | of Representatives this day.
Gentlemen of the Senate, and
' C I Gentlemen if the House of Reprefentativet,
;jf I THE dispatches, from the Envoys Ei-
I traordinar)' of the United States to the
m French Republic, which were mention
-3S ed, in my meflage, to both Houses of
â¢ Congress, of the fifth instant, have been
n ' examined and maturely considered.
While I feel a fatisfaftion in inform
in ing you, that their exertions, for the ad
!c. juftmcnt of the differences, between the
t _ two nations, have been fincer; and un
,d remitted, it is incumbent on me, to de
id clare, that I perceive no ground of ex
petition, that' the objects of their mis
sion, can be accomplilhed, on terms!
, s compatible,with the fafety, honor, or the
y efiential interests of the nation.
This refulc, cannot with justice be at
[ tributed, to any want of rfioderation on
( j the part of this Government, or to any
r indisposition to forego, secondary inter
-0 efts for the prefervntion- of Peace.â
Knowing it to he my duty, and believing
~ it to be your wiih, as well as that of the
great body of the people, to avoid by all
s concÂ«ffions ariy participation
Â« in the contentions of Europe, the pow- !
? ers vefte.d in our Envoys,were comtnen
e mrate with a liberal and pacific policy, j
v and that high confidence, which might '
1 j'jftly be rcpolpd in the abilities patriot- j
( lfm and integrity ef the characters to
whom, the negociations was committed.
' After a careful review of the whole fub
jeft, with the aid of all the information
I have received, I can discern nothing,
| which could have irifured, or contributed
to, success, that has been omitted on rfiy
part, and nothing further which can be
attempted, consistently with maxims, for '
which our country has contended, at e- â 
very hazard, and which constitute the '
basis, of our national fovtreignty. v |
Under these circumstances I cannot for- 1
- bear to reiterate the recommendations,' <
I which have been formerly made, and to 1
exhort you, to adopt with promptitude, c
decision and unanimity, such measures 1
as the ample resources of the country as- c
ford, for the protection of our feafafing c
and commercial citizens; for the defence a
of anv exposed portions of our territory j c
for repleminingoiu* Arlcnals, eltabl lining [
foundries and military manufaftures ; s
and to provide such efficient revenue, as ?
will be necessary to defray extraordinary "
expences and supply the deficiencies,
which may beoccafionedby depredations Â«i
On our commerce. ' f
The prdent state of things, is so efien- ti
tially differentj f-om that, in which in- a<
ftruftions were given to collectors to res- n.
train veflejs of the United States from P'
j failirig in an armed condition, that the si
| principle, on which those orders were
issued, has ceased to exist. I therefore a '
deem it proper to inform Cougrefs, that !h
Ino longer conceive myfelf juftifiable in m
continuing them, unless in particular ca- "
fes, where there may bereafonable ground fÂ«
of suspicion, that such veflels are inten
ded to be employed contrary to law. ,h
In all your proceedings, it will be im- "
portant to manifeft a zeal, vigor and Â§<
concert in defence of the national rights,
to the danger, with which J
they are tlireatwied. v *

11. Insurances will also be made Â©n buiMingsana j
roods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned j
to the risque. But it is Â«ot easy to arrange these ,
uader particular heads or classes, so as to delcribe ,
each with the necessary accuracy. Each caf* tuuft
therefore be decidedupon accordingto thecircum- f
{lancesattending it ; and thele circumstances will,
in general, appear from the description accompa
nying the application. '
Budding- partly conftruiled of bricic or stone,
are preferable to those wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the stile of builoiing, how they are oc
cupied, how they arc fituited, the neighboring t
buildings, and how occupied, are considerations to
betaken into view. And with refyeA to goods,
theii^tendency, whether from their ntture, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, cither
to commence or to iacreafe an accidental fire, asd
their liability in such Hate to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden andhally removal, or to be tto
len in time of eonfufion and hurry, are all cir
cumftancssof weight; and, the premiums mud be ,
proportioned accordingly.
111. The following condit;ont are to be under
stood by the parties .
id. The Insurance is ftot binding till the ftipa
lated premium be paid ; but it (hall be'deemed et
fedual from the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the poiicy be immediately
signed or not.
id. Insurances raay be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
ptnfetthan the payment of the premium of the re
newed tcrm.the circumstances continuing the fame
as they weretinderftood by the Insurers at the time
the former insurance was made ; but the payment
of the premium is essential to such renewal ; and
if, -the party irsfured fuffers any time to elapse Â«fter
the expiration of the former insurance, beforeJie
pays a premium for the renewal, lie is not insured
during such time ; aor can theinfuranee be renew
ed on the former policy b*t by computing the
commencement of the renewal from the expiration
of thÂ« former Tnfurance- The fubje<st of inTur
anee may neverthelefi be open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. If a'y other insurance bewiadeon the fame
property ; itniuft lie made known at the time of
application, otherwise the policy nude on such ap
pLcation will be void.
4th Goods held in trull, or on conflgnment,
may be insured as such in a flsparate policy; but
th<iy arenot to be considered as infuttd otherwise.
,?th- This company will net be liable or accoun

eign invafiin, or by aay military or ufirped force,
or by pjafon of aay civil commotion ; or occalion
ed by gunpowder, aquafortis or other thing of t&e
like kind kept in the Building, or amonglt
4th. Bills of Exchange, Bonds and other Secu
rities, Title Deeds, Money, Bank and other pro
milTary Notes, are not included in any insurance ;
nor are paintings, medals, jewels, gems, antique
curioftties, or mirrors exceeding the Valae of twen
ty-fivÂ« dollars each, to be considered as iafuredun
lefs particularly mentioned and by special agree
ment.
7th. No infarance will be made for a ftorter
term than one year, nor for a longer term than fo
vea rears. Persons choofirg to infara for fsven
years [hall be allowed one year's premium by way
of difeount: One third of a years premium (hall
be abated in like manner on an infuraace far
three years.
Bth. I.offes fuftaincd by fire on property insured,
(kail be paid in thirty days after due prouf and li
qaidaticn thereof, without deduAioa.
A defci.iption of the property to be iefurod will

a matter'carpenter and signed by him, as well as
by the owner of the building 01 applicant for in
