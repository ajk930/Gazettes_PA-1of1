â rt Mr. Dallas mult pardon the abuse, as he calls it,
ââ¢ of I ennfylvanienfis, as it was engendered by liw
to neglect of what he himfelf acknowledges to be hi,

ile In your paper of 21 (I ind. he was charged wiih

f e -within, by a correspondent, who said that he had
,v, iatisfied himfelfj on examination of the cafe as listed,
c> that it was not Jet forth <witf> accuracy am/jhat the
â word within was omitted.
Here waÂ» the charge di'eftly made. If Mr,
a D. thought it his duty, as he fay, lie does, to re
m lieve the public mind from the effett, of a oiifre
f. prcfenrttion relating to any official tranfitfioii,
d why did he not immediately do his duty and thtic re.
a lieve the public mind, before hi_s long silence cotild
j. be tonftrued into an acquiescence in the justice of
the charge ? Had he done so he would have bcea
n fccure (on that score at least) from anonymous abuse:
â  e He would not then have permitted his fellow-citi
>. Zens to be juftifiable, as they now are, in the fup
â¢r polition that anonymousaluse has a greater effect in
it inducing him to aifcharge his duty, than any wish
n he may have formed to relieve the public miad from
Â£ any misrepresentation whatever. v
i. His endeavor to lay the blame on a tranfenbtng
â r clerk will not fail, without any comment, to be
0 duly appreciated.
y Mr. D. calling it an indecent supposition that the
c judges had given their opinion on the law, without
r reading it for themselves, has much mistaken my
intention. It. was generally fOppofed by thofs
who were willirÂ»gto apologize for the extiaordir.ary
y opinion of the judiciary, that they had.formed
r that opinion on the mutilated extradf, and l think
tCat it really i, the be ft exeufe that can be oijered
for them.
It was my sole wilh to bring these tranfafit'oas
.into the serious confii'.eration at my fellnw citiztr,
âthat objedt is attained. Let those whose duty^
it is investigate the matter and lee whether (as hi<

To the EleSors of the Prejident of the United States.
RespeCtable fellow citizens,
CREDIT lias been very erroneotifly given to
Mr. Adams, as agreeing with the Prcfident, and
the executive officers, and.indeed with the govern
ment in upon the fubjeft of all the rj;ea
fures which have been purftted under the federal con--
f flitution. It is a well known faff, however, that
Mr. Adams has never been considered or treated as
an executive officer The office of Vice-Prejident
has been kept in a perfefily dormant (fate, in an ex
icutive lenfe. Mr. Adams has not at all participa
ted or co-operated in the executive councils or bufi
uefs of the United States. He has been always
considered and treated,only as the President of the
Senate; that is, as the speaker, or chainjian, of
that branch ef the legislature. Hence, he has not
resided at the feat of government, except during
the feflion of congress. It is also true, and it it of
very grfat importance, that he is ftrengly opposed to
the great operations of the financial system of our
country, though adopted by congress, approved
- by the President, and confirmed by repeated legis
lative and executive ads. We mean here explicit
ly to affirm, without fear of contradidfion, that
Mr., Adams greatly disapproves of the funding and
banking svflems, and that he does not hesitate to
speak of them as matters that hare and will produce
extreme and extensive jllsÂ»l Phocion will net deny
this: and every man must perceive what use he
would mike of the fame fct&e againll Mr. Jefferfon,
could he bring such forward. â¢ He has attempted,
to eliminate Mr. Jrfterfon, on the score of our fi
nances, by arguing from particular allegations con
cerning the opinion of forae, who are rep.resented
as nnder his influence. But here are no foch wire. <
drawing, of Mr. Adams's opinions. That gen
tleman will never hesitate to admit, that he has of. 1
ten spoken of the funding system as certainly to
bring upon this country evils the mofl extremeâ \

Untied Staus, whose fenttments, upon the funds
and the banks, ate more opposed to the opinions of

ftdei and exariiine well into this matter. 77v t
