The Primary AfTemblies of t'Aiu have 1 ycl

At Rouen, Amiens, and Valenciennes, I p!
the eleftions have been very quiet, and were I
worthy of the cause which honest men de- I
fend. At Nantz, the choices have been J
tolerably good,notwithftandingthe intrigues j is
e of the Jacobins, and the culpable indiifer- I a 1;

f- violence, but the well-disposed people were j si
r- not intimated by their threats, and armed 'c

not confirm the reports propagated on the
ot credit of a Gentlemen's arrival from
a | Holland, of the preliminaries of peace
he i being agreed on between the Emperor

n " : indicate negociation. Our readers will fee
:s > ! the material facfts brought by the mail in
re the extracts we have made from the Journals.
The channel fleet, it is said, does not
en proceed to sea till after Parliament"has fanc
ia' tioned the request of the'failors.

; had a long interview with Mr. Pitt, to fet
gn tie the terms and payments of the hew Loan.
" j The following are the terms of the New
â  of . Loan.
- x * ' .14,50,0001 for England and Ireland
3ns For eveiy 100. fubferibed,
125 00 Three per cent. Consols,

! for every 100. fubferibed,
fly J 226 10 o Imperial 3 per cents.

IRUH PARLIAMENT.
HOUSEQF QOMMqNS.
Wednesday, April la.
The house, plirfuar.t to the order Â«f the day,
resolved into a committee of ways and mean?,
Mr. Mason' in the chair;
The chancellor of the; exchequer, after stating
to the committee the pressing exigency of the state,
fsrafuuply of money to prepare for the necessary
means of public defence, and the inadequacy of
the steps which he had already taken under the
direction of the house for procuring 1 that supply,
f,iid it was become sbfoiut'.ly requisite on the |>re
-1 lent occaflon to take fopie extraordinÂ»ry step for
that piypofe. He vvas ready to admit the meafurc
â  he was about to propose was such a one as he
Ihould have wiihed, if pofiible, to avoid, but it
> waÂ» his misfortune to be oblgcd to resort to very
ineligible the duty of providing for
- th? public exigency; he therefore moved that a sum
noi exceeding loo.oaej. be borrowed 011 th*. fal
lowing terms, viz. for every 6jl to give the lend
. er a debenture for 1001 bearing fntercft at 5 per
[ cent.
â Mr. Vandeleur exprjfled the deepest concern,
, that, Â«:er the zealous desire which had boea ex
-1 prelfed by fevera' of the merfibers of that house,
that the right lion, baronet (hould give them an
4 opportunity of tsftifying their ardor in contribut
ing to the defence of their country, and, astir the
s rjght hon. baronet had complied with the delire,
by eltablifhing an open loan, at a very high inter
cit, that nune of the men of property in tlut house
r or in the country, had cctic forward with a finglu
' (billing to aid the government in defending that
property. Lamenting this circumstance of public .
1 apathy on the part of men who were Co deeply
concerned in the defence of the country, he mull
* assent to the meal'ure now proposed by the right
f hon. baronet, ruinous as it was in its nature and
t tendency. This was a branch' of a system which
i- had already ruined England, and was now extend
ed hither for the ruin of Ireland. It was one of
il the points of that ruinous war irr which we had
1- been involved by the tfrltilh ministers; a war com
menced and carried on in 4ire& violation to every
â â principle of justice and policy { but it was a mea
,f sure which, in the prefenfftatemf public exigency,
e he saw was inevitable, and therefore could net op -
pofcit.
! The chancellor of the exchequer again profefTed
hisrelu&ance in adopting the measure, but declar
ed he had not rcforted so it until every orher ex
ertion had failed.
- Mr. Bagwell said, he had converted with fnme
y monied men on the subject of a loan to govern
ls ment, and especially one, who was an agent to
'* moll of the absentees, and; who had 16,0C01. to
lend, and the principle mentioned by him as the
5 bed inducement, would be transferable debentures,
at 6 per cent, with a bonus of 3 per cent.
s- The chancellor of thp exchequer disproved this
mode.
f Mr. iYandeleur condemned the condn<S of tlie
>f British miniifer in not aiding by his influence the
c. negociation of thii loan in England for the ule of
a Ireland
,i- The chancellor of the exchequer and Mr. Pelhr.m
f. defended she conduit of the Britilh minister, and
imputed the failure of that negociition in not
raeching its intended extent of joo,oool. to the
rofiftance of the governors and dirc&ors of the
:> ' S batik of England.
le After some further conversation, the motion
m palled in the afirmative.
ce The house being resumed, after some routine
or business, adjourned.

that the left body of the army was going to

from the important position which it occu

we could only have an Â»ffair of the advanced
ports, which Gen. Ney and Soult command
ed, with that valor which they are known
to possess. These officers so contrived, as Â«
to arrive with the enemy at the defile of the _

Herborn to Wetzlaer, pushed them vigorous
ly and took from them 500 prisoners, two J";
of whom are officers. [c(

general of that r.ame, took 320 of them with fÂ°

''What would conftitute'a siege or blockade was
a question of the law of nations; hut the existence
of the ficge or blockade must in tbe firft instance
J)C notified to neutrals by the party forming it. It j
V ould be known in no other njanner: for the neu- c;
trals must be unacquainted with the circumstances, ] r
and the besieged party would not teftify against
themselves. Indeed access could not be had to
them, and of course their opinion could not be i
known. Tbe besiegers nnuft therefore make the
declaration in the firft instance, snd neutrals must b
believe it. Whether faift? or true, becomes after- v
wards a question in the courts of admiralty [or bÂ»-
tween the governments; but for neutrals to dit
pute it in the firft instance, at the mouths of their
eapnon, would bean act of hostility : therefore if b
a French squadron ftiould place itfelf before an a:
, English port in the Weft-Indies, and declare it in a Â£
state of blockade, our armed ships must be in- n
' ftrrnitcd to abstain from any attempt to enter. E- .
ven if half dozen French privateers were to fta-
I tion themselves off Portsmouth, andj declare it in a t.
. state of blockade, our Ihrps must not dispute the o
[ point, or attempt to go in by . force, If they do f
not think it blockaded they may attempt to enter
i peaceably if they fleafe, and when taken, diipute
" the point in the courts of admiralty, or leave it to c
f the two governments, to be fettled by ncgociation ; r
. but they must be prevented, from clearing out {
for such ports with arms, and forbidden under (
' strong penalties to attempt to enter by forte.
Shoukl they make such attempts it iÂ« at their own
c ;ifk, and not an a& of the government.
S *So also as to places declared to be in a state of t
j . rebellion There arc several ports in Weft- i
' Indies] which the French authority there has dÂ«clar- ,
ed to be in this state.* ' |

MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE ?)
BOSTON, June 7.
Yesterday, precisely at 12 .o'clock, agree- "J
ably,to previous notice, his Excellency 111
the Governor met the Legislature, and w
delivered the following
SPEECH: P :
Gentlemen of the Senate, and j".
Gentlemen of the House of Reprefentalivesâ b .'
TO live under# free government, and en- "
joy its bleflings. is a privilege which but b<
few people among the nations of the earth P 1
. enjoy, and it must be a pleasing reflection
L to those who are called to administer it, that
they are carrying into effeft the will <lf the tc
people, as it is exprefled by their lawsâ w
[ laws which are the result of the calm invefd- w
s gation and deliberate judgment of the Le- c<
giflative Body chosen by the People them
l selves. On this ground, therefore, our Gov- 1
j ernment has the strongest claim to the as- "
t fe&ion and support of all its citizens, who
-1 cannot fail of receiving an adequate return, r<
â Â» in that protection and security which it will "
1 afford, if its principles are adhered to, and Â£
I the laws faithfully and impartially adminif- 11
e tered. And the obligation, perhaps, will a
I be strengthened, when it is considered, that j n
â  while the constitution and laws of tbe Com-! c
" monwealth,'proteft and defend the rights of ; t!
~ the citizens, our Federal Government com- | a
f bines the interest of the United States, and , 11
n affords additional security to all. It is my j
a firm opinion, and I believe the opinion ] P
!" my fellow citizens in general, that the Fe- ! c
j" deral constitution, conneÂ£ted with those of "
a the different states, has hid the foundation J
ic of that security and happiness which we had
0 fondly anticipated ; as a proof of this we
r need only compare the circumftaaces of our _
country previous to its adoption with its un
'; rivalled prosperity since : This also, will af
jt ford fatisfaftory evidence of its having been
cr executed with fidelity and ability, by that
:e " beloved and distinguished fellow-citizen, -
" who, after a life of ufefulnefs to his coun
of try, has withdrawn from the cares and ar.x-,
I- ieties 'of office, to the (hade of retirement ;
â  r " where, I trust, he will continue to enjoy the '
bleflings of his countrymen. âWe deeply re- !
gret the lossâbut feelareliefin the appoint
ment of his successor, whose known integri- <
ty, ability and patriotism leave no room to
doubt that the duties of the Executive De
partment of the Federal government will con
he tinue to be ably and faithfully performed.
of The afpeft of our affairs, relating to fo
â¢re reign nations is far from being agreeableâ
rs no one can reflect on the unjuftifiable depre
he dations committed on our commerce from
1a- time to time, without the greatest concern.
fe- I know no cause for the offence that feerns
to- to have beeen uken, but that of our exer
pas cifing the rights of a neutral independent na
f! tion, Undoubtedly, peace and friendfh'ip
rd with all the world, ought to be the motto
M. inferibed on the American Eagle ; but at
ru- the fame time, it ought to be remembered
that the citizens of the United States, will
ttle never peaceably surrender to any power on
earth, their rights as an independent nation.
iin They cannot but feel very sensibly the in
ne, juries committed on their commercemore
an especially those proceeding from'a great na
on- tion, whose friendfhip they highly valued,
ieh and whose happiness they have not ceased to
Ive wish for.
les, The President of the United States in his
but late address to Congress, has pointed out the
rig, mifunderfUnding that unhappily exills bet
ger ween the government of France and that of
not the United States, and has his in- j
)>w- tention to institute fre(h attempts at ncgoci
â  ation, and thereby promote, if possible, an
The accommodation upon honorable terms. It
led, is my most fervent wilh, and in which every
, in friend of his'country will join me, that thole
vith overtures may be attended with success, and
und that the magaanimity of the French pat", jo
will not f:iflfer them to attempt to deprive ii!
of the law of nati
ons, the Umted States are clearly intitled td
as an independent governmerlf.
But in any event; I am perfr.sded thx*.
the citizens.of America will not be willing
to fubjecl themselves to the evils that mr.V
rc fult froiji being a di vided people J but with
Â«o4,u.irÂ«!.inuty,-.fiÂ»pj>ort in this Cri
tical fituatisii of our afEiirs, such meafares
; a 6 may be. adopted -by the g?>vcmnieut of
(â¢the United State?, to whole judgment,
queftionb oÂ£ such national importance pro
perly belong. . 1 hare ;t-full confidence, that
the people will maintain their national cha
rafter, and convince the world that they can
not be separated from their nation.4 govern
ment, ly the arts cr influence, of any Gov
ernment or people whatever-! they well
know, that under Go/i, they mull depend
on themselves for their liberties and indepen
dence, and I hope it will be ilnde; Hood by
all mankind, that while American citizens
are just and liberal in their traufa&ions with
foreign governments, the)- are -determined tt>
be firm in the support of thÂ«y own.
There-. is gne duty, iudilpenfuble on all
citizensâit is the price of their protection
.âI mean a cheerful fubmiflion to the lawt,
accompanied with a readiness tc aid the civil
magiflrate in the constitutional and legal
discharge of Lis duty.âThis idsa cannot be
too strongly imprefTed on the mind of everv
citizen, lor it appears to me, one of the -
principal pillars on which our free republic
rests. To unite in ftfpport of the lSws, and
.thereby dSFufe the hiefiings of peace, ordir
and. good government throughout thecom
. munit,}' mtift be the interest/ as well as the
duty of all-; arid as the only tnethod by \Vhieli
we can receive the full benefit of our free
find' happy political ififtitutions. It will not
I presume, in this cnlightenctj age, be deni
ed that the fnrcft method of securing and
perpetuating the liberties of a people, is by.
promoting knowledge, religion, virtue and
industry among them.-
The triumph of arm* may lead to Fame,
but these alone can give liability to Empires.
Under the patronage of wife and able le.-
giflators, the Ufeful, arts, sciences, agricul
ture, commerce and improvements of our
country, cannot fail of being greatly extend
ed and liberally encouraged. 1 (hall be hap
py, gentlemen to co-operate with you in ef
tablifhin'g such measures, as (hall be thought
bell adapted, to promote these valuable de
ligns, as well as in any other, that may be
thought necelTary to encreafe the public
welfare.
While we, gentlemen, in our several de
partments, may be exerciiing our thoughts
and exerting our bell abilities to establish the
blefiings of peace and promote the prospe
rity of our country, I hope we never shall
be unmindful of our dependence on the Su
preme Governor of theUniverfe, whofefig
nal interpositions, in behalf of the United
States, must have been observed and ought
to bÂ»acknowledged by all. Let gratitude
warm onr hearts for his favours, and in the
way? of well doing we willyet hopefor their
continuance.
Permit me, Gentlemen, only to add, that
I entertain a moll lively sense of the honor
done me by the people, in placing me in
, the chair of Government, and that the best
return I can possibly make, will be to pro--
[ mote their happiness in the way which the
[ Constitution and laws point out; and to as
sure them, that feeling a sincere disposition,
1 as far as lies within my department to pro
t mote their prosperity, I (hall invariably
consider virtue, attachment to the conflitu
f tion of our country, and the love of order
. as among the firft qualifications in incivil and
j military appointments.
, I shall be ready at all times, to give every
f possible dispatch to the public business, and
. | communicate by message all such matters as
f may be proper for the confederation of the
r, Legislative Body.
