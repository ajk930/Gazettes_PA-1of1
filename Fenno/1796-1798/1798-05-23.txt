IUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Thursday, May 10.
Mr. Matthws prefentedanaddrefs from 1
Elkton, in Maryland, approbatory Â©t the mea-
lures of the Executive with respect to oyrlate *
negociations with France, and expreflive of
determinations to support the government. â
Referred as wfual.
. The House, on motion, again resolved it-
ielf into a committee of the whole on the bill
-authoriling the President to raise a prcvifional !
army, an'd the coufideration of the motion for
tfriking out the firft fe&ion being resumed, *
Mr. W. C. Claiborne rose, and said it !
*was with reluctance that he had at any time
Â«refpai?ea upon the time of the House; but, 1
on a question so important as the prcfent, he
was unwilling to give a lilent vote. He own- 1
ed himfelf diftatisfied with the principles of ,
the bill upon the table, and in favour of the |
.motion to strike out the firitfe&ion. He wi(h
ed it not for a moment to be fitppofed that he '
\Vus led to this opinion from local considerati
ons ; on lubje<. c ts of national importaÂ»ce, no
thing ftuHiid ever influence his vore but the
common good of the Union. The security
which was ascribed to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, on the Monongaheki, could not
be ascribed to him. Herefided in an exposed
part of the Wefterncountry, amongst a people
whoie latiity does not depend upon their
numbers or situation, but upon their deter
mination to refilt attack, come from whence
it may; and in the event of a war with France
the State of Tennelfee will be as apt to feel
the horibrsofitas the States of Georgia or S.
Carolina. But when he came to realon with
the gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr. Har- i
er) on the best meansof defence, they dilfer
ed on the thre/liold of the difcufliori. That :
gentleman thinks a Handing force is neceflary; I
he, o&i the contrary, was persuaded that if the* j
implements of war were dispersed amongst the i
citizens, they would be equal to their own
4efeiiCâ¬, at least with the aiiiftance of the ci
tizens of the adjoining States.
The gentleman from South-Carolina allows
that the permanent defence of the nation lies
in the militia; but he conceives, that in or- j
der to bring forward all the force of the mili- j
tia, it is necellary that a regular force should j
act along with them. Here they differed in
opinion. He himfelf was inclined to believe
that militia and regular soldiers seldom agreed
togetherâthat they view each other with |
contempt, and that they act best apart, and j
he placed the greater reliance upon militia.â ;
He knew that it was a popular opinion that |
troops long disciplined to bloody warfare, j
were a better security for a country than mili- j
tia; but with great deference to military cha- i
raCters, who were far better acquainted with |
the subject than he could pollibly be, hecon
ceived this opinion to be founded on error, !
and foftered by prejudice, though palmed !
upon the world for truth. In countries dif
ferently lituated from ours, this might be the
cafe. When a war is carried on between
Kings, by means of Slaves \vho support their
authority in time of peace, it is necellary that
the troops on both (ides should be equally ve
teran and well disciplined, because they want
that amor patrice which animates a free citizen
in the defence of'his country and h s liberty;
b.ut when an army of these disciplined troops,
who fight only far pay, are oppofed<by a body
of citizens who contend for every thing dear
to man, victory never fails to crown thecaufe
of freemen.
By ivbom, said Mr. C. was the army of
Hanqib.al driven out of Italy, but by the Ro
man militia. To whom did Greece owe her
fatety, when attacked by Xerxes, but to-her
militia. Pafiing from ancient to modern times,
to whom did Holland and Switzerland owe
the preservation of their liberty for so many
centuries, surrounded as they were by despo
tic powers, and opposed by reguiardifciplin
ed troops but to the bravery of their militia.
put we are told, laid Mfc. C. by the gen
tleman from Maflachufetts, that the veteran
Generals of France cannot be made to believe
â¦hart our militia are able to stand before their
artnves. He believed those generals would
riot have a doubt on the subject. They would
remember the prodigies of valour which their
own militia performed. They will remem
ber that the mi'itia, of France laved that coun
try from the fate ot Poland. That that mili- ,
tia had fought her battles, and laid the firft
corner stone to that monument of military
lame, which Buonaparte and his army have
lince completed.
But if all idea should prevail ift France, that
the militia of America is not equal in battle
to those of the molt tried nations in Europfc,
let thein call to remembrance the revolution
ary war of this country, and they will imme
diately be convinced to the contrary. He by
no means wiftied to detract from the merits of
our late small army; they fought well for their
country, and they have been rccompenfed
principally by the liberty which their brave
ry afliftcd to obtain. He could not speak of
that body of men without respect, and when
he' saw a member of it his heart palpitated
with gratitude for? hisJervices, but he believ
ed notwithstanding, that it was principally
owing to the militia that we were enabled to
pluck from the British crown ilie brightest
gem which everornamented it, in eftaDlilhing
the independence of this country ; and he
believed the fame militia was itill able and
willing to defend us against an invasion from
France, or from any other country.
Mr. C. said, he felt for our present critical
situation as much as any man upon that floor;
but he did not apprehend the danger of an in
vasion to be so great as the gentlemen from
S. Carolina and Massachusetts seemed to think
it. He must own he felt 110 dread on thisac
count. If France (till thirfu forconqueft and
military prowess, or if her armies still fight for
rapine and plunder, as gentlemen are conti
nually faying they do, the old government
of Europe afford much stronger temptations
than infant America can otter to them. Ws
have nothing, said he, to court their avarice
Our- bldlings consist of a good government,
liberty, a good climate, and a fertile foil'â
Contented with these bleflings, he was per
iuaded his countrymen envied not the polfef
fions ot other nations; and however we may
fympatbize,with the diftrelfes of Europe, it
ought to be our wilh, as it is undoubtedly our
latere ft, to preserve peace with all the hu
man family. He trusted that when the pre
sent European war fbajl cease, our rights will
again be refpefted ; but if France, in the pa
roxysm ot her phrenzy, fliall attempt to in
vade America, he believed the palling of this

law for a provisional army would be of no (er- t
vice. Suppose the law were immediately r
palled, and the President were immediately
to fend out recruiting officers, what kind of c
men would make up your battalions ? The j<
danger is too remote to induce men who have 1
an interest in the country to leave theirplough ji
, and turn soldiers ; and if this army was now ji
p embodied, it would conlift of the refufe ot a
societyâos men who might wear the garb of v
soldiers, but poflefs few, perhaps none of their i f
virtues. j ii
I There was a ground of objection to this bill 1
I upon which it was his intention to dwell but a
r little. He meant as to the unconftitutionality f
of the firft clause j for, after the gentleman v
I from Pennsylvania and the gentleman from , e
, Virginia had spoken on that point, it was not e
in his power to fay any thing new upon it. c
I But he viewed the trust placed in Congress to 5
~ raise armies as an important trust, and to de- r
J-! legate it to the President would, in his opi- t
nion, be to attach a refponiibility to him t
which was meant tp be placed in Congress t
â only. But the committee were told by the r
~ gentleman from MaflTachufetts (Mr. Otis) u
that this was an improper time to mention
I constitutional scruples ; that this was a time t
for acting. He was.of opinion, however, that ]
the Cortflitution, that palladium ofonrrights, <
t never could be too sacredly guarded, and this <
I of all others is the proper time to take care it t
e is not invaded. In times of tranquility, Con-! t
r grefs do not feel disposed to fur render their ;
authority; but whep danger approaches, and )
e alarm is every where gone abroad, then it is â¢ <
e that Congrels may be moil likely to be pre- <
I vailed with to give up powers to the Exec it- ]
tive, from an idea of promoting the public
'good (but which may prove its greatell mif
fortune) which, at other times, they would
_â¢ hold with the greatell tenacioufnefs. He need
lt i not remind the committee, that the greatest
j evils had arisen from fuffering the Executive
j power in governments to polfefs too much
e j power. We need only to look at the nations
n ! of Europe to fee that the loading of one Exe
cutive with power, has frequently enabled
his fucceflbr, at some future day to enslave
s the people.
, s The gentleman from Massachusetts and the
; gentleman from S. Carolina, have each in
_ ; their turn, laboured to (hew the neceflity ot
n ' advantages to be derived from the employ
e merit of regular troops. Their eloquence, he
h i the fafetyof the people did honour to their
_ ! this army ? No ; one of thein tells the corn
et | mittee that Victor Hughes, with his black
* ; troops, may go against Savannah or Charlef
f' I ton; the other, that when peace is made
L _ j in Europe, France may tranfpoFt an army tÂ©
h j America. But if these events were to take
: place, would this Provisional Army give fafe-
I ty to the cÂ«untry ? No ; it must be the Mili-
j tia which must avert the danger, and eventn
r ally be the security of the country.
Ie So far as relates to himfelf, he had foftered
n in early life an impreflion untavourable to the
i r employment of (landing troops, from having
n seen that when they were once introduced,
were scarcely ever laid aside, and that
they eonllantly proved the bane of liberty ;
these imprellionshad grown up with him,and
]. he still retained them, and they were height
s' ened by the recent experience which he had
iy ' had of the mifchevious effects of futh troops
ir in the State which he had the honour to repre
j*e sent; he had seen that they might be made
the organs of opprelfion, and be the means of
0 f introducing amongfta happy, peaceable peo
pie, much disorder and injury. Here he would
Â£r flop. He wifhedjto draw a veil over the inju
gr rieswhich had.beendone to the oeopleoT Ten
,s neflee by means offtanding troops ; hecaufe, no
sooner were these wrongs known to the Gene
iy ral Government, than every department of
it (hewed a willingness to redress them. But
the occurrence notwithstanding strengthened
a his former impreflions against a (landing army*
n _* Mr. C. concluded, by faying he would not
in speak Â©ft heex pence of thisarmy, orofthediffi
ve culty which would attend the collecting of the
; j r money, because he did not wilh to trespass
Id longer uponthe patience of thecommittee. He
did not flatter himfelf that any thing which he
,j r had said, or could fay, would change thefen
n_ timents of one member of the committee ;
n _ but he trusted all would believe he ("poke from
the sincerity of his heart, every sentiment of
r ll which was deeply interested in the prosperity,
ry liberty, happiness, and independence of Uni
ve ted America.
Mr. Brooks had no doubt the gentleman
iat from Tenneflee had delivered to the commit
tjc tee the genuine sentiments of his heart ; but
e notwithltanding that he could not bring hirn
n' felf to join in fentinaent with him. '1 hat gen
e_ tleman had laid that Militia are better troops
b v than a Standing Array. This was the firft time
G ' t - he had ever heard' the sentiment advanced.
e j r Whatever objection there may be to a Stand
ed ' n Â£ Army, he thought discipline was every
, e _ thing. He did not think that the allusion
which he had made to the troops of another
cn country, who were willing soldiers, or to our ,
e( | owp Revolution, would authorise the opini
v_ on. He would call the attention of the gen
-IIY tleman to our revolution. He did not mean
to depreciate the Militia ; but it was well
known they could not be kept in the field'for
ng any length of time together. He remembered
j-j e aninftance in 1776, at Am boy, where a com-
pany of Militia were drafted for a particular
, m time, and whenit expired, they determined at
all events to return homeland a)l that could
be said to them could not induce them to
* r . itay. Men who leave families behind them
, n ' fwil not continue contentsdly beyond the tima
)m orl which they are called* If the M.iiitia alone
Mere to be resorted to, a much greater nuin
lC_ ber of men would be in the service,
nc j and the expence of retaining them would be
for & re ater, according to their numbers, than if
ti- regular troops were employed.
Nt The gentlemaai last up, and others, had said
mb there is no danger of an invasion. Mr. B. asked
Vs what all the preparations are making for on
ce the French coast ?
ir Mr. Cijaiborne explained what he had
[ ' said about danger.
or Jfthere ftiould be nÂ© danger, Mr. B. faidi
no army would be railed, for the uncertainty
la y whether we ftiould be invaded, or not, wasthe
' j", reason why the power of determining the time
} r ot raising the army was placed in the Prsfi
u_ dent. And notwithstanding gentlemen conti
re nually call this a Standing Army, if they look
r ;U ,11 the bill they will find that the President will
have the power of dilbanding it whenever it
n _ (hall ceale to be Hecellary. Besides these ar
(S gtimecÂ«>di(i not go against the bill, but against

the detail of it, which might undergo amend- d
ment and modification. a
Gentlemen have spoken on the conftituti- c
onality of this bill, but he thought these ob- tl
iections had been comphtely anlwered, and n
former laws which had been palled aftet a si- ai
milar manner, proved that heretofore no ob- a
jection was made to this mode of proceeding, c
and until gentlemen cduld lljevv thedillrrence o
which exists betwee.: thole laws and the pre r ft
; sent, there was no neceflity for spending time ir
jin answering these objections, lie could not v\
fee any objects on to the bill on ground, d
as it was calculated solely for the purpose of h
saving expence. With refpeit to any danger a
whichcould arise from the mifttfe ef this pow- o
er, it was a mere chimera. He believed v
enough had already bean said on this qhefti- F
on, and he hoped the question would be taken, ti
? Mr. Gallatin said, he would not take ii
{ much of the time of the committee in relation d
Ito whatmightbe called the conftitutional<sueÂ£- Â©
lion under conlideration ; yet Ke found* from m
the manner in which his argufhents had been si
noticed, it would be neceflary to make a saw b
additional obfervatipns 011 this subject. v
He uadrrftood that the object of a cohfti- 0
tution was to secure a proper distribution of p
power amongst the different branches of a 1
Government. It was a security never poffeflT- t
ed by any country before the constitutions of d
the United States were formed. In Great Bri- c
! tain whatever diltributiop of powers may exist, r
an a<ft of parliameiit may transfer any power >c
from one department to another. The only 1
â¢ check then upon the life of that pow- 1
eris public opinion. But in this country, the j
principle of.the constitution is, that no depart- [
ment of f-overnment can exercise that power <
which has been given to another department- 1
Gentlemen, however, seem to suppose the
conftitution may remain inviolate, so tang as ]
there is no forcible aflurnption of power by any
branch of Government from the other, Â»*id ;
1 that a transfer or free gift of such power <
; would nor be a violation ot the constitution. ;
He considered the effect to be pTccifety the
I fame which ever way it was done. The ohjcÂ£t
i of the constitution was to aflign forever j
tain fpecific legislative powers to CongrefÂ® ; Â«
: and ceirtain other powers to the Executive,
1 and whenever one department shall exercise :
E the powers of the other, in whatever way it j
shall be done, the constitution will be broken,
aad the security intended by it will ro longer
: exist.
r If these remarks are applied to the cafe un
* der consideration, it would be found that one
f of the most important powers that could be
â  vcfted in Congress, viz. the power of raising
: an army, is, by this bill, proposed to be tranf
- ferred from Congress to the President. This
! he considered as a dangerous principle, and if
) Â©nee admitted, it would be in the power of
: Congress to destroy the Constitution. Yet
- thecommittee are told there are precedents
- to authorize this procedure. He knew the
- line, which separates executive from legilla
tive duty, is jfometimes very indiftinÂ£t ; and
1 in some cases of not very great importance,
s where thediftinftion might not be very ftrik
* ing, Â©r had not perhaps been attended to,
, powers which, striCtly speaking, were Ugifia
t tive, may have beeii lmjiroperly given to the
; Executive ; but is an instance of this kind to
i be brought as a/ precedent for passing a bill
- of fp important a nature as is the present ?
\ Because power has been given to the President
s to build ten gatleys, if he shall think them
- neceflary, and to spend 80,Â©00 dollars ; should
e it now be inferred that there would be no
f impropriety in giving him the power to judge
- of the neceflity of raising an army of 10,000
d men, which are to colt 'the United States at
- least tour millions of dollars a year ? If that
- conclusion was drawn, lie would ask whether
d Congress might not also transfer any of her
- other important powers vcfted in themâsuch
if a3 the power of laying and collecting taxes,
it and that of declaring war ? And if so, it was
d admitted that Congress have the power ot
'. destroying the Constitution ; for limitation
)t clauses to laws were frequently opposed as ini-
I- proper ; and it a single Congress palfed with
e out any limitation clause an aclfinular to this,
fs or giving for ever to the Executive,, the power
e of judging of the neceflity of raising an army,
e or otlaying a or of declaring war, orot
1- enacting law,s, he a Iked whether the legiflativ.e
; power of Congress would iK)t be annihilated ?
ti And yet this is the objection whicl\ some gen
)f tLciile.it call it ridiculous to entertain, whilst
r, others charge the supporters of it with a want
i- of candour and sincerity.
After stating this, Mr. G. said, he believed
n he need not anlwer the obje6tions of the gen
:- tleman from Connecticut (Mr. Dana) who
it seemed to think that he (Mr. G.) had relied ,
1- upon a mere verbal difference in the wording
1- of some of the clauses in the Constitution. â
)S He would now fee that he did not raise his
ie objections on so flight a ground, but that they
i. arose from the general principles and spirit of
1- the conftituion itfelf. Mr. G. said, he might
*y be told that no danger would arise from this
Â»n transfer of power, as it was not to be fuppof
?r ed the President would abuse it, and that he
ir ought not to suppose the cafe of future
i- lature's palling such improper aCts as he had
mentioned, or at any rate transferring other
111 powers to the Executive, because this Con
ill grels was going to transfer the fpecific dif
or cretionary power contemplated in the feftian
:d under conlideration. But ought they to put
1- more trust in future legislatures than in them
ar selves ? And if the gallies were brought as a
at precedent to induce Congress to pass thia bill,
Id would not this bill be brought as a precedent
to to induce future legislatures to make still fiir
m ther aÂ»d. more dangerous transfers of power ?
tia Were not evident symptoms of that disposition
ne dilcernable in this very difcuflion ? A gen
ii- tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Otis) had
e, pofLtively asserted that if the President was to
ae give information to Congress that in his opi
if nion, there was imminent danger of aninva
iion, Congress without examining the grounds
id of that opinion, must neceflfarily a<st in confor
sd mity to it. The fame gentleman had said,
>n that if the validity of the objections urged
against this bill were admitted, it would de
id clare all fo.nper laws. enaCied upon the fame
principle null, and of coiufe the whole of our
d> present army would be diflblved. This could
Lty not be the cafe ; for if there was any thing un
he constitutional in the law fixing the military
ne establishment, it was the power which was
si- given to the President to forbear raising, or to
;i- djfeharge the men, when he should think them
ak unnecelfary, which power had never been
ill executed, and therefore could in nowifeaf
it feet the mi!itaryeflablifhmcnt now existing.
r- But the commitiee are told that the pre
ilt sent dangerous situation of our country ren-
ders it neceflary to pass a law of thiskind. It C
appeared to him that when gentlemen were r<
Called Upon to mew where this danger exist a, U
they wet*e at a loss how to answer. They had h
not shewn where it is ; almost all concurred in
an opinion that there would be no invasion by n
an army this season. After a peace was con- u
eluded in Europe, some gentlemen were of it
opinion there might be danger but not at pre- it
sent. The gentleman from 5. Carolina had n
indeed pointed out a part of the* country w
where he fiippofes there is at present some
danger, and it was the only quarter in which ft
he himfelf expected any annoyance at present, ii
and uporl which he had already mada some ji
observations. That gentleman had, howe- tl
ver, gone on to detail the manner in which the a
French may laud, and the points most likely c
to be attacked. Jf that gentleman be sincere f;
in his fears, and really thinks that imminent ii
danger exists, he ought to vfote for the railing 11
of the army immediately, otherwise the force v
which he wished to raise, would be too late v
for the quarter in which this danger is said to \
be so imminent. But the gentleman in the t
whole coivrfe of his observations, has spoken t
of this seCtion as giving to the President a t
power, whenever danger shall appear of cat- t
ling' these men out or embodying them, as if g
the proper power of railing an army was fud- Â£
deftly to embody men togetherin an emergen- e
cy ; whereas it must be clear to him that these 1
men must firft be enlisted and colleÂ»sted, whilst a
on the contrary the militia alone could be cal- t
led out or embodied immediately. Indeed a a
militia force might be called out and have re- 1
peljed a predatory attack, before 500 of this J
provisional army could be raised. He conceiv- \
ed only two things were wanting to make c
militia more effective than at present, which 1
were provided by the additional iettions re- 1
ported to this bill by the seleCt committee, ;
which were to furnifh them with arms, and ]
also the equipments for cavalry in the south- !
ern states. He hoped those seCtions would be
agreedto, and then he thought the gentlenHan
from South-Carolina (Mr. Harper) might
be perfectly easy on account of the fafety of
I the southern states. If we were to be engag
| ed in war, not only by sea but by land, and
an invading army was to Jand under an idea
: of subjugating the country, or of bringing us
j to a dishonorable peace, he would then agree
1 that a (landingarmy would be neceflary to aid
the militia; but at present he did not think
j there would beany reafo.iable expectation of
such an event.
Mr. G. said he hai been lold that he might
consider himfelf fafe on his farm on the MOll
- and that the people ot the South
ward would not be very thankful for the op
position he made to this force for their de
fence. But was it proper to introduce cir
cumstances of this kind into debate ? He did
not believe that by any vote which he had e
ver given on that floor, that he had fhewna
ny unjuftifiable attachment to his constituents
to the injury of other parts of the Union. He
should undoubtedly, on all occasions, support
their interests, so far as he understood them,
whenever it could be done confidently with
the good of the whole, but never in opposition
to that good.
Mr. G. supposed that if the danger was ve
ry great on the Southern coast, more would
have been heard of it than by the private let
ter of the gentleman from S. Carolina (Mr.
Harper.) He himfelf did not believe there
was any great danger to be apprehended at
present from invasion. But the arguments
i of gentlemen went to shew that the danger is
: now imminent, and consequently that the ar
-1 my ought now to be raised ; and yet, in fie ad 1
of aCtmg cohftftently with their own argu
ments, they support a bill by which an army
â¢ is to be railefl only in cafe of a change of cir
* cumftances. When gentlemen wilh ro eftab
-1 lifh the belief of a probability ot an immedi
, ate invasion, they refer to the conventions
? which palled in Paris betwixt our Mini Iters
E and X, Y and %. If they believe that they
1 lee, and the President believes that he fees in
that coij,veiiationathreatenedinvafion, liefup-
the army would be immediately railed.
, indeed, from what he daily heard and saw,
[â¢ he was of opinion that the President believed
, imminent danger now to exist. But the fcc
f rion under consideration went, taking the ar
-1 guments of the gentleman to be well ground
> ed, to throw the refponiibility of a measures
. which in their opinion was new necessary,
t from themfelveson the President.
t But the committee had been told by the
gentleman from N'e'w -York (Mr. Brookes)
1 that the militia are more expeniive than regU
- Tar troops. Mr. G. believed that whilst they
> were in levice they were moreexpenfive, on
i account of their marching to and from home;
; but the great difference betwixt the two for
- ces was, the militia were only called into ac
s tual service and paid when actual danger ex
y ilts, but an army receives pay all the time it
f is in being. Of course an army, if considered
t a cheaper weapon of defence, Ought only to
s be raised in time of actual danger, and dif
- charged when it ceases to exist.
e Shall 1, said Mr. G. be tokl it is improper
- to speak of expence in a business ot this kind ;
d He said he knew well enough, that in cafe of
r actual war, or invasion, it would be ridiculous
- to talk of the expence of defence. And if j
the committee now believe that we are in4m
n minent danger, they ought immediately to
it raise an army ; but as they suppose the dan- 1
- ger does not' at present exist, the expence was
a a proper subjeCt of difcuflion. He would not
, however, on the subjeCt of this bill, have said
it any thing about it, had it not been aliened
- that no expencecould be incurred on account
? of this law. He wiflied to know why gentle
n men had so earnestly infilled upon a permanent
1- land-tax, in order to insure a permanent loan?
d That loan and that tax were wanted for the
o sole purpose of supporting this army, as all
- the expences at present incurred are provided
- for by the present revenue and one year's
Is land-tax. Without this army there would be
- no neceflity to a permanent land tax. Let not
I, gentlemen amuse themselves with the idea,
d that at the time tney are giving the Pre
:- fident a power to raise an army 10,000
e men it will be attended with no expence.
ir If they give the authority, they mull
d reckon upon paying the men, and this can oh
-- ly be done by a.permanent land-tax. lleliad
y therefore voted against making the land-tax
is permanent, because he was against raising t,his
;o army, and he could not conceive how gentle
u men who had agreed with him on that quef
n tion could confidently be in favour of this.
F- If they were in favour of the army, they
ought, in order to provide the means, to have
voted for thp permanent land-tax.âAs to thje
1- made by the gentleman from S.
[_VGLUME XIII.
Carolina betwixt the troops proposed to be
raised by this bill, and a (landing army, he
looked upon it as frivolous; the
ing army meant a regular force as diftinguifh
eÂ»i trom the militia; you may call it by that
name, or limply an army, which are the words
used by the Constitution ; it w ill not change
its substanceâand in Great Britain, whore
its exigence, on account of the annual milfi*
ny bill, was a!ways limited to one year, ic
was always called a Handing army.
He would add one rotnark with refpedt to
(landing armies. Military men on this floor*
in favour of an eflabiilhment of this kind,
judge of a regular army from what they (aw ot*
the Revolution armyâbut, such an army, he
apprehended, v&ouldnot again be seen in this
country, except in cafe of invasion, when the
fame spirit would animate our citizens which
inspired them heretofore ; but a (tending ar-Â»
my, in time of peace would always be found
very different from the patriotic army with
which those gentlemen were acquainted.ââ 
With refpeit to militia, he believed nioft of
those gentlemen were better acquainted with
their merits than lie could pretend to be, yet
they have not only denied that the militia of
the United States are capable offarving a*
gainst a regular army, for any length of time*
but also of repellingan invasion. lie believ
ed with his friend from Tennellee, that very
many instances in our revolutionary war {'poke
a contrary language. If he recolTeCled right,
the enemy was kept in Bolton for more thau
a year, and at lad; driven from thence by the
militia ; and he believed the State of New-
Jersey was iccovered in 1777 by the militia,
when hardly the appearance of a regulararmy
exited. Advancing to a nother period of the
war, which perhaps decided it, lie asked
whether the landing army would have been
able to ltop the course of General Burgoyne,
had it not been tor the militia, which poured
from all quarters, checked his progref's, and
so eminently contributed to his capture He
knew great services were performed by regu
lar troops, and that in cafe of actual war they
were necelfary; but he believed the militia
were equal to the repelling of any invalion
which Could, under present circumltances, be
contemplated.
Mr. Pinckney said, he did not intend to
have troubled the committee with any obser
vations of his on the- present question ; be
canfe he thought all the arguments which had
been adduced against this bill had been fully
answered; but as they were again repeated,
he must be permitted to fay a-few word* in
reply.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania had said,
with great truth, that it was the object of
those who formed the Constitution, that the
powers of government should be distributed
amongst the different departments, and that
they ought not to be afligned or relinquilhed.
All mull be agreed as to that point. The on
ly question is as to its application in the pre
sent cafe, and whether the power proposed to
be granted by this bill gave away from Con
gress th 6 power of railing an army, to any o
ther department of government. If this pow
er was generally Transferred to the President*
he might at all times raise an army, without
the consent of Congress; but it would not be
said that this watvld be the cafe, if this bill
should pass. It is not doubted that the Le*
giflature may order an army to be raised by
. the President, in cafe of a declaration of war,
or of aninvalioiv; but gentlemen fay the con
tingency ought not to depend upon the opin
ion of the Preiident. But, Mr. P. said, this
must either be done, or you mult burden your
constituents unneceffatily, by railing the ar
my before it is wanted. It had been said that
it was not fair to argue from former violati
ons of right. This, he allowed, was a fair
objection as it refpedts real violations of right,
but where a-thing has frequently been done
1 in one way, and no objections, raised to that
course, it. was rcafonable to suppose that
course was not unconltitutional.
1 Mr. P. was surprised to hear gentlemen
attempt adiftinttion between the cale of im
mediately railing an army, and ordering it to
, be-raifed;in cafe ot certain contingencies. If
he could discover any difference, he should
be for immediately voting tins army; but not
feeing this, he thought it unreasonable that
he should either burden the country with an
i unnecelfary expence, or leave it in a great
, degree defencelefs. He believed the power
proposed to be given to amount to no moie
: than this. It said to the President of theUni
-1 ted States, 'f if war should be declared againft
this country, if we Ihould be inv aded, or if
' you should have certain information that force
1 is preparing to make such an invasion, you
; (hall proceed to raise this army." He tho't,
â¢ therefore, every confiitutional objettjonmult
â  fall to the ground.
But an objection was made to this clause
t because it gave power to the President for an
1 unlimited time. He ihould have noobjedti
:> on to limit the period within which this pow*
- er should be exercifcd. He should have no
objection to limit it till the next meeting of
r â  Congress.
; It was said, that if Congress had the pow
t er to velt the power of raifmg an army in the
s President, they might also transfer the power
f of raising a tax in hiifi. He believed this
- might be done in the fame way. A law
3 might be palfed for raising a tax, fpecifying
- the mode of laying it, and the quantum ofmo
s ney to be raised, but with a provilion that it
t should not be collated until it was wanted, or
d until forne contingency should take place,
d But if this was done, he -should not conceive
t that he transferred the power of railing taxes
- to the President, any more than the passing of
it this bill would transfer the power of raising
1 i an army to him.
e The'paffing of the present bill in this form,
1 would also lave ex-pence in more ways than
d one. It would shew to the powers of Europe
s that wc were determined to prepare- for our
e defence, and that if an attack ihould be made
>t upon us, we are determined to repel it. It
1, was upon this ground that he was in favour
- of railing 20,000 men instead of 10,000. To
o lhew a spirit of this kind, he believed, would
'. be our belt means of defence, as it might pre
it vent any attack being made upon us, and by
- so doing, save us an immense expence.
d But it had been said, that those who wished
x to prevent the land tax becoming permanent,
is ought to vote against this bill, as the one was
- to meet the t/xpencc of the other. He did not
think this was the cafe by any means. Many
3. who voted in favour of the land tax being an
:y nival, he doubted not, would vote for tius bill
r c also. Th,ey might conceive that the money
would be batter raised in another way.
>. With refueft to the expediency oiftiic mea-sure, it appeared to him that it would be wife
and prudent in the Dnited Sues, in cafe of ah
declaration Â©f war, an inwafionj or threatened
invasion, not-to lose a moment to add this
force to our Peaceeftabliftiment. The com
mittee had been told that 011 a former occalion,
the Militia were found adequate to the de
fence of the country. He believed an instance
of that kind had fcarcÂ«ly ever occurred. He
knew they had been of essential beaefit in sup
porting the regular army ; but the inllances
were few in which they of themselves render
ed any elfential service in the war. He had a
gentleman in his eye, under whom the Militia
had alone rendered very considerable service.
â He I'poke particularly of the affair at King's
Mountain, 111 N. Carolina. But the Militia
would never remain in the field torany length
of time. It was true, he saw Militia in the late
war that were equal to any troops in the
world; these conliftedof men Â« hohad been dri
ven from their homes by the enemy, and who
could notofcourlerettirnto theirlamilies. But
God forbid this country (houldever be brought
into a like situation again ; if it were, Militia
would then be as good troops as could be had,
but not under any other circumflances.'
The gentleman from Pennsylvania had
mentioned the cale of Bolton. That was a ve
ry particular cafe. A small Britilh force was
encamped in a very populous country, where
the people were united in one fpn'it and trained
to-arms. They certainly were very serviceable
in the firft inliance. gut what was the opini
on ot thole who were at the haad of our Mi
litary Affairs at the commencement of the
.Revolution i Dirt they think the Militia were
equal to the defence of the country ? No ;
they did not. Ihe firlt step they took, after
the firft hostility was to organize a regular
corps. A Communder in Chief was appoint
ed, who carried the country through the war.
He went to Boston, and raised men as regular
troops. And this lie believed it would be pro
per to do now. He had as good an opinion of
the Militia as any man, but he believed it was
neeefl'ary to have regulars to mix with them,
Butthefame gentleman instanced Neiv-Jer
fey, where he lays great honour was atchieved
by ihe Militia. Mr. P. believed some of the
Militia were present at these actions ; but he
did not recollect any thing brilliant performed
at Trenton c(r Princeton by the Militia, with
out a regular force. If the gentleman made
enquiry into the business, he would find the
troops were mixed, and that the principal
part of the defence performed by regular
troops.
He mentioned another cafe almost exactly
of the fame nature. He meant the army which
captured General Burgoyne. Mr. P. said,
there were, he believed, more than one per
son present who w-as engaged in that affair,
and if the gentleman referred to them, he
would find that brilliant attion was not ac
complilhed by Militia alone. Those gentle
men will tell him, that had it not been for a
regulareffeilivearmy, Burgoyne's army would
never have been captured. He believed not
less than 6,000 regular troops were present.
The arguments drawn from these inliances,
therefore, fell to the ground.
Some gentlemen seemed confident in the
opinion that our Militia would be a fuflicient
defence for the country. For himfelf, he
would not helitate to fay, he Ihould feel him
felf much more easy, if there was a regular
force in the country from which he came, in
aid of the Militia, than if there was none.
He did not lay this from a w ant of refpeft tor
the Militia of South Carolina. They had
heretofore atfed well, and he had no doubt
they would do (o again, iftheir service (hould
be wanted. He had it froma gentleman whose
duty it was to attend to them, that they were
as ready to meet an attack as any Militia on
the Continent. He had not himfelf feert them
for many years; but if iÂ»or
were stationed in the lower part of the coun
try where the population is sparse, to be
marched to any place where an attack might
be made, he (hould be better fatisfied, than to
depend entirely upon the Militia. Ifitwas
not, .ndeed, for the expence, he (hould be for
immediately railing troops to fend to that
partof the country ; for he believed a preda
tory invasion might take place from the Weft
Indies, and do considerable mifchief there,
before an effectual force of Militia could be
drawn out to oppose it. Feeling as he did,
therefore, he could not but vote for the pre
lent bill.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania admits
that it may be neeeffary to have a Standing
Army in time of actual war; but fays it
would be improper to raise an army before we
know whether we (hall have any occasion to
use it; but the gentleman ought to recollett
that except this probability exists, in a very
strong degree indeed, this army will not be
raised.
Before he fat down, Mr. P. said, it might
be proper to m ke a few remarks upon what
had fallen.from the gentleman from Tennessee.
Had it not come from his authority, he
could scarcely havÂ« conceived that militia
could, at any time, have been an overmatch
for regtihr troops. But the gentleman has
relied upon ancient hillory for the illnftra
tion of his position, and has spoken of
Greece and Rcme. He would remark, that
if this country was situated as Greece and
Rome were, and our enemy in all refpe&s
as theirs, the comparison might hold with
more force than it does at present. Besides
if the armies of Greece and Rome were mi
litia, there were no armies at that time.
Those countries defendsd themselves by ar
ftiies which they could organize and difcL
pline in the best manner, which they cauld
march a thousand miles from home, to con
quer diltant provinces. They were perhaps'
the mo:l regular armies which ever existed.
If, said Mr. P. we expected to be attacked
by militia, he (hould be willing to trust our
defence to militia ; but as it was likely we
should be attacked by well disciplined troops,
he fhotild wifli to have regular troops to meet
them.
But the militia of France was brought in
to notice, and their valour highly spoken of.
If we had the power which France has ex
crcifed of making a well disciplined soldier
of every man from 18 to 25 years of age in
one rcquifition, and if those were not fufli
cient, to call for a second and a third, it
might be said our mil tia would be equal to
the troops of France. But, God forbid
that we should ever have occasion to do this.
When the militia bill was under confidera
tiou, he was for imitating the French fyflem
in some degree, by dividing the militia into 1
felefl and referced corps, in order to give all '
our force military knowledge. He would '
remark, however, that when the French cal- '
kd out these militia, they grafted them up- ]
on the remainder of a well organized army, 1
to which, perhaps, may be ascribed, in a '
great degree, their successes. 1
With refpeft to the danger to be daaded
from aiÂ» acmy of this kiod to the liberties of
| Uie people, he laid it was petfe&ly ground
left. He was as much an enemy lo a(la:id
ingarmyin time of peace, aÂ»any maD ; but this
t was obe anarmy so a particular emergency.
Iftheargumentsofthegcntleman|fromTennef
: fee wentto any thi..g,they multgo to the dif
bandiag of our prelent small army employed
. principally in the defence of our frontier.
But what degree of blame can be imputed
i to ihe troops employed in Tennessee, to
i which he alluded ? None, in his opinion.
If there wa-. any blame it was in the law
> which originated in tljat house, dire&ing
| certain measures to be taken, and that any
, person f ttling within certain bounds in that
. llate which belongs to the Indians should
be removed by the Executive, and if he tho't
> it nectffary, by meaus of an armed force.
The President thought the time was arrived
J when he ought to carry the law into execu"
tion, and he did it.
From all the considerations which he had
I mentioned, and which he recapitulated, he
should be in f.tvour of retaining the firft fee
' tion of the bill, whith might afterwards be
[ modified, so as to become more generally aÂ«.
ceptable than it now appears to be,
Mr. M'Dowell said, the gentleman
from S, Carolina (Mr. Harper) had yester
day worked up his pafiions in representing
the dangers to which the coast of S. Caroli
na and Georgia are exposed, from attacks
which may be made upon them from the W.
Indies, and attributed the want of a similar
teipper in other members, to the security of
their situations. Though he himfelf lived
near the mountains, yet he set for thofc
who resided en the fÂ«a coast, with which he
was well acquainted. When that coast \va3
' formerly attacked, the people in liis neigh
bourhood (hewed their readiness to give the
citizens there every possible affillance, and he
was certain, if the fame necessity again < c
curred, they would be as ready as formerly to
defend their country against any invader
whatever.
But he was sorry to hear that the condi
ments of that gentleman were so greatly a
larmed, that they trembled for their fafety.
[Mr. Harper said, that he did not lay his
constituents trembled, but that they were ap
prehensive of danger.] Mr. M'D. undcr
ftood the gentleman as ullng very strong ex
prefiions on this fubjeA ; but if this law
were to pass, he supposed all would be well.
And yet, if the constituents of that gentle
man were in daily apprel'enfion of being at
tacked, how could the palling of th s bill re
lieve them, since these men were net to be
raised, until imminent danger appeared ? It
mud be recollefted, that during the summer
fellion, 80,000 militia men were ordered to
be held in readinefj, and any part, or the
whole of which may be called out, whene
ver it (hall be neeeffary. And would not
these be more effe&ive than the railing of
10,000 regular troops ? They certainly
would. If any attack was made, it would
be of a predatoiy nature, and the militia
would soon crush it.
Much had been said about the service of
the militia, and of regulars. Mr. M'D.
said, he had served in the regulars and knew
their ufefulnefs, and if a war took place, he
would give his chearful a (Tent to the railing
of an army ; but nothing (hort of war, or
adual invasion, would induce him to go into
an eftablilhment of this kind, as he believ
ed the militia adequate to our defence in the
firft inftaace. He Ihould therefore be op
posed to the bill.

- pointed on that part of the President's speech

To the YOUTH o/PHILADELPHIA.
GENTLEMEN,
WE have embarked in a glorious cause
The Genius of Faftion stands trembling at
our ardourâlt has pursued its course, unin
terrupted for a series of yearsâeach step has
been marked with theravagesofits scourging
1 handâits career commenced with inveterate
maliceâwith malice has it been pursued
1 each objeft of its attack, which fell beneath
its powerful hand, has only encreafed its
vigour, has only strengthened its inveteracy
. like theaccurfed Upas, which by its bran
[ ches darkens and blasts every aspiring sprig
which falls within its reach ; the Genius of
' Liberty has begaa to wither in its presence,
and aided as it is, by envy, calumny, and
, every vice which di[graces mankind, jt has
, gained a height, from which, alas, it can
scarcely be hurled ; but are we destitute of
a remedy ? Is there no method pointed out to
flop its dreadful career, and avert the blow
it has levelled at us. Yes, my friends, a
remedy, which if applied with the hand of
prudence, will not only injure the branches,
but deflroy the root. The ardour, the en
â¢ thufwfm, the zea! ofour youth, present a front
at which it stands appalled. Wnthingwith
agony, and in a paroxyifm of despair, it
make* one more ; one desperate effort. Well
convinced that nothing can withstand our u
nanimity, all the force of its expiring mo
ments is excited to damp, to annihilate it ;
I but its exertions are vainâthe end of it's
career is markedâits reign has ceased
Liberty once more reigns triumphant. But
who can traceits progress ? Who can pledge
himfelf that it will not take licentiousness by
the hand, that it will not be deceived by its
specious appearance, thai it will not press
it to its bosom ? Should this be the cafe,
who pofleflea not penetration fufficient to dif
coverthe consequences ? Will it not by the
foftering hand of Jibe ty be exalted to an e
minence which we shall view with dread ?
Do we not wish to fee the garden flourifh
pure and uncorrupted, without a weed to
obftruA the growth of the flower 3 ? We
have discovered the remedy ; the spirit of '
unanimity exists. All hearts are bent on the
support of their rights, on the defence of
their country ; but in carrying the plan in
to execution, is there no danger of over
leaping the endofures of liberty, and wan
toning at large in the fields of licentious
ness ! Can we not err with good intentions ;
These observations are fuggelted in con- i
sequence of a disagreeable occurrence, which
lately happened at the house of a certain '
Printer in Market Street. Fired with en- '
thufiafm, and an honed zeal for the support
of their country, and insulted as they con- ,
ceived themselves by the observations which I
flowed from his Press, and probably exhili- <
rated by the pleasures of thedayâthe youth 1
who (hone conspicuous in the cause of Free
dom in the morning, were led to commit an
aft in the evening, which certainly reflefts no |
credit on them, but forms the ftroÃgeft con- <
traft to a conduft which has placed them in
so amiable a light.
When we consider the motives by which
those young men were aftuated, the circum- \
stance might admit cf some palliation. If ,
in aiTcrting our rights and avenging our- '
selves for any infnlt we may have received, '
our vengeance could fall on theguiity alone, ]
Some might be offered ; but when
we consider, that a wife and family who j
certainly have n<*-erred, (and if they .
had, jhould It unnoticed,) rauft unavoidably
(hare in the punilhment ; when we consider
that tlie aft v\ as committed in the night;
- when we reffeft that the offence cÂ«nfifted
merely in publishing fenliments contrary to
to our own ; when we consider that the au
thor of such sentiments always (lands open
â¢ to the world, and amenable to the laws ;
when we view ourselves, by the aft, as
wresting from the hands of the Magillrates
that power with which we have entrusted
s them, in fine, when we consider that |ve
; have done an aft, which we pledged our
selves to endeavour to prevent others,
1 from committingâwhat (hall we think
: of it ? What (hall we fay ? We (land
1 at present in a situation, in which the pru
dence, the wisdom of three-score are requi
: site 10 preserve us with fafety and with hon
or ; the flame which has been kindled by
' the Genius of Faftion in another clime, is
> fall approaching our shores ; iuhreatens tÂ®
annihilate us ; we rulh on with impetuosity
to arrelt its progress by removing from its
â¢ course such materials as may aflilt itâwe
( think vrc cannot miss the path. Let us how
' ever, my young friendsj be convinced that
' such an event may occur ; let us view our
felv sas mortals and as such liable to err.
W-ll these confideratioiK fail of keeping us
within the bounds of propriety ? Let us
â  view ourselves as Americansâwill not this
' prevent us from.committing an aft which
might fubjeft us to the- censure of the
woi Id ?It will. Jull entering as it were,
the thfeftiold of the Tewp e of Fame, the
eyes of the World are fixed upon usâthis is
the time to el"' Â«.ur charafters upon a
lure and ftroi.g Kalis. Firmness combined
with mm!. -linn now, will place U6 above the
critieifms of mankind hereafter. One error
will leaji give currency to their censures.
Let us t'heji be firm, united, moderate. Let
us endeavour to (leer in the path of- propri
ety. Let us not bow beneath an insult on
ths one hand, nor retaliate too hallily on the
ocher. On the oneJide % let us view our coun
try chiming our jffilhnce, 071 the other,
our own sharafters to l'upport. With these
in view, We cannot err ; the finger of scorn
will be pointed at us in vain ; the tongue
of calumny will tail of its aim ; the rude
envy will pass us by. Thas (hall
we be worthy of ths name of freemenâ
Thus (hall Wafhiogton rejoice in his coun
trymen. Such, my young friends, are the
sentiments which croud upon the mind of
one who anticipates with pleasure the idea
that his prayers for your . success will be
wafted to Heaven. He cannot call them
difinterejicdâthey cannot be so, while he
continues to be ONE OF YOU.

PARIS, March 11.
There has been a tumult at Rome, in
which a number of the French 101 l their
lives; it was however loon quelled, and a
ni mber of the ringleaders arrelled and pun
ilhed. A proci amation upon this occafioA
was published to the people, in the follow
ing terms.
" Rumours were yeflerday circulated that
discontents prevailed in the French army.
The faftious, fanatics, murderers and rob
bers, came to a resolution to take advantage
of the moment; th*y began their tnafona
ble practices by murdering French soldiers
found alone, or in (jmall parties in different
quarters of the city ; they then collefte ) in
the quarter beyond the Tiber, and paraded
with a fanatic at th. ir head, carrying the
image of the Holy Virgin, to the C.urch .
ot St. Puer, (houtirg ' Live Maria,' where
infteadof a religious ceremonial they cut to
pieces the whole of the guard, and forcibly
took polleflion of the bridge of Sixtus, and
the neighbouring avenues- If their plan had
succeeded, a general plunder would have
commenced in the Jews street, and after
wards extended throughout the city. But
the villains knew not thefpirit which infpireg
French soldiers; they knew not that thefirft
fousd of the drum hallens them to their polls,
especially when the welfare ofa peoplewhofe
happinels only they have in view depended
upon it. I was advised of the tumult in
time. Large numbers had collefted beyond
the river. I placed myfelf at the head of
the troops, and withou losing time marched
againfl them. We were received with the
fire of mufquetiy, but republican bayonets
| loon bore them down. The gate near which
the unfortunate Duyhot was murdered, to
gether with the bridge of Sex us, were ta
ken by dorm, and peace is reliored.
" Inhabitants of Rome fear nothingâ
the French wi(h you happiness; the pro
ceedings of last night are a clear proof of it.

It was said the dillurbances among the

their lives ; and 500 were confined in the

PARIS, March 20
The feaft of the Sovereignty of the peo
ple was celebrated here in etfery department
with atl the order of decency that could be
wilhed, ~~-
The ceremony Â®f presenting the nineteen
standards conquered by our armies from the
troops of the Oligarchy of Berne, was very
solemn vefterday, and attradted a great
concourle ef citizens. Tbefe nineteen flags
were carried by as many veteran defenders \
of the country into the hall of the public
audience of the Executive Direttory. At
the head of the procession were Suchet and
,Ruby chiefs of Brigade, sent to the Di
redtory by gen. Brune to lay at their feet
the trophies taken from the vanquished
The miniiter of warin prefentingthefe brave
men, made a speech ; thetwo warriors spoke
after him ; the Piefident of the Directory
in answer to the whole finifiied his oration in
these words : Invincible warriors, wherever
danger calls, your arms make fortune fub
!je<a to your claims, and your last victory is
I'alwaysthe pledgeof another at hand. There
remains an enemy whose crimes multiply
like your triumphs. Conquered in the field
they place their hopes in intrigues, in mer
cantile hatreds, the fury of priests, the fac
tiens of nobles, political terror ; they em
ploy erery resource ; they put in practice
every artifice ; but scarce are their plots re
newed when they are destroyed by the aven
ging steel of the republicansâGenerous
Soldieis I The moment is at hand when you
will at last floptheprogrefs of their attervpts,
when you will call them to an account for
the tears and the blood they have caused to
I be shedâThese are the last labours which
: you burn with ardour to finifh, it is there
also yiu expeQ the last viftory, the idea of
which makesevery freeman's heart palpitate,
and which will insure you thanks and ac
knowledgments in the name of humanity."*
ThÂ» President then gave the two warriors
the fraternal embrace Â£nd prefentcd to each
in the name of a grates 1 country a pair of
pistols of the national manufadtery at Ver
sailles.

hear that a negociation is commenced.â
Let us not deceive ourselvesâthe thing
moll devoutly to be wilhed, next to a change b
in the French administration, is, that the o
present set may throw off the maskâNo , o

NOTICE.
HAVING observed an advertifemcrt of C.
Gullagcr, in terms derog-atory of Â©ur pro
feffional abilities, we have to request the public
not to be imposed upon by foreign artists ; but to
decide upon the merits of Â«ach lÂ»y a comparison ot
the work executed by both, as it is a mode almost
universally adopted by them to invalidate the ta
lents of e.lablilhed artists, with a view of deceiv
ing the public, and engrofling that bufincfd which
their profefiional knowledge in no wife entitles
them to. Well knowing that public opr ion mufi
govern, we flatter ourselves that the work exccut-*
ed by us will convince them of our great superio
rity over Mr. Gullager iu every branch of por
trait and ornamental painting, andlhew thenecef
fity of judging for themselves.
