-rf !Â» yarii, and from thepce by water tÂ» George-Town and cel
tlie City of Walhington, about 3 miles, and to Alexan- .' e!
dria about 11 miles. This situation, aided by a fufficient
capital, will command the produce of a very extensive,
back country, where large quantities of wheat and other
grain is annually made, the distance to ft being from 8
to 10 miles less than to any market town upon the navi
gation of the Potowmac. There are on the premises a
largeftoneCoopers' ihap, a stone granary, and acommo
fent dious miiler's house. At the landing aforefaid a bridge P|
; u is now building over the Potomac, which is in great'for
waVdnefs and probably will be finifhed the enfutng fall,

more may be opened-with eafethe stone taken from thel'e g
quarries is better, arid has the preference at this market,
to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries j
feparately or together as may best suit.

7 i this is the Poem for the pjibfiihing of which _he_ has been

' ! romanceâ" A young painter, indulging a vein of plea
''son I fantry, sketched a kind of Car.v. rfctkn Pic*, rcfpetfling a/

no f coflce-pot, with fpeaÂ»cles cn his nose, seemed to contem
atte. plate a newspaper ; and the ass ornamented with a huge
ie in tve-wig (which, however, could not conceal his loi.g
enn- ears) fat for Ws phfture to the monkey, who appeared
lew- with the implements of painting. This -whrnf .-l
I afforded some mirth, and met with general approbation,
until (omc mischievous wag hinted the whole was a lam-
I poon upon an old officer, a physician, and a member of
â ' I Parliament; an insinuation which was no iaoner qircu.at-
Di- ed, than these people began to be alarmed, and Â«ven to

6 * They have prevailed in different ages and countries)
as far baek as historical information can tarry lIS '
and are in fail as old as ths creation. Abraham
and Abimilcck ratified their covenant by the folem
"e~ nity of mutual oaths, as did also Jacob and Lahan
âin which cases we observe, that. Abraham and
Jacob received the oaths of Abiraile.k and Laban
/ though they swore by Jal/e Gods, which are a c .
knowledged by modern writers to be binding, p ro !
vided the party believes in the exigence of 01J God
the creator of all things. Swearing by inferior de!
ities in such cases is considered as a mode of appeal,
ing-through ihcm tÂ»jhe Supreme Being; agrees,
bly to the declaration of oar Saviour, Â« He that
fweareth by the throne of God, fweareth by him
who fltteth thereonâand he that fwcai'cth by the
temple, fweareth by him who inhabits the f aruc >Â»

i'o and terminated in a foleinn invocation of the G d
of all Gods.
If wefuppofethe institution of an oath to be of
divine origin, yeMhere is no doubt, that human
authority is competent to eftabhfh those forms of
{wearing ihat are hfoft calculated to strike with reli
gious awe and veneration. Accordingly the forms
of {wearing vary in different countries. But in
one point all ages and countries have uniformly con
curredânamely, that oaths are to be administered
to all peifons according to their opinion, and iu such
form as mod affects their consciences.
In the old testament we find Abraham called
upon his servant to swear, and requiring him to
place his right hand under Abraham's thigh, whife
he repeated the words of the oath to him; and
Jacob used the fame ceremony when lit made hit
son Joseph swear he would not bury him in Egypt.
The persons of the Gentoo religion in India'
when they take an. oath, fall 'prostrate before the
bramin or pueft, and lay the right hand upon tht
bramin's foot," andt an oath of this kind hai been
admitted to be legal evidence in England, because
the Gentops profefs a belief in one God, the creator
andjjovcrnor of all things.
A Mahometan fweais upon,the
plaee his l ight hand Jlat upon it, and his left h ? ud
upon his forehead. In this posture be looks ftea
dilyatew minutes at the Alcoran 1 and by this ce
remony he conceives himfelf bottnd to ipeak the
truth.
A Jew is fworti upon the five books of M o feÂ« t
'upon which he lays by right hand.
The general form in use am >ng Chriftia::j, is t 0
lay the right hand upon the bible, or the new telh
ment only, and to kiss it. The ceremony of lay
ing the hand upon the book, is undoubtedly of ,
Pagan origin, and was introduced among the pri.
mitive chrillians from the example of the heathens,
who were accustomed to swear in the prefencc of
their falfe godsâand sometimes by aftually'touching
or laving t{ie hand upon the facned titetifilsof their
# superstition. The mode appeared fplemn and af
fe&ing to the christians; and therefore the prefencc
of the bible when they swore, was substituted in
the place of the falre gods of the Pagaos, and writ
produced as a sacred memento of the religious obli
gations they were under tofpeak the truth. Hence
we find tome of them swore with the hand' laid
upon the bibleâforge open
hefore themâfoms by laying their hand upon tiie
breajl, others with the h nd Jhetched out, or lifted
up towards heaven, but always with ihe 'sacred
book in their immediate prefencc and fight. The
insatiable spirit of superstition which finally termi
nated in the eftablifhtnent of popery, had at that
time made considerable progress in the Ciirillian
church ; and to this spirit we mull ascribe the cir
cumllance of kijfing the book, and the expressions
we 1 .njetimen meet with in antieilt writersâfi> help
me God and bis faints, which last words, viz. and
his'faints," have been omitted the Protelfants j
though they rtill retain the former, and the cere.
| mony of killing the book.
; 1 hus we fee the mode of fwearincr among us, is
i partly of pagan, and partly of pnpifh extraction.
Among the early Christians, great latitude was ad
mitted with refprdl to the form of ftvearing ; nor
does it appsar that any mode whatever was pre
scribed, bus that every person made use of the form
rnufi agreeable to his canfcience. Even la the reign
of Charles the second in England, we meet with
an instance of a do&or Owen, Vice-Chancellor of
Oxford, who heinjr fameSned'as a vt&ncfs
orn by laying his hand upon the bible' and
kissing it ; but he caused the book to be held apen
before h:m, with his right hand lifted up towards
heaven, and was sworn in that form. The jury
some doubts, whether he deserved as
much credit as a witness fworn-in the common form,
put the qbeftfon to the court. The chief.juftice
with the utmofl liberality fold them, the doctor
had taken as ilrong an oath, as any other withefi,
and was as much entitled to beliefâbut added, if
he himfelf was to be sworn, he would lay his right
hand upon the book.
riiefe and many other forms j}f fvvearing have
been made use of in the worldâbut an oalh does
not consist merely in form. It confills in something
more than laying the hand npon the bibleâkifling
it- looking at itâor having placed it in our fight
with the hand held up or ftretchtd out. These are
so many (hadows, and alter not the nature of the
tranfadtion. It is the fclemn appeal to Godâit is
engaging to speak the truth, and calling upon him
to witness our fmcerity, that constitute the oath
an<3 obligation. If this be lone, it is immaterial
whether any or what form, be used. Whether the
witneGs kiss the book, or lay his hand upon it, or
whether he does neither, he is equally bound to
speaK the truth ; and if he does not, he is guilty
of .perjury. But though oaths are obligatory in alt
religions, however indiitinct the views they exhi
bit of God and his attributes, yet is their force
peculiarly binding ;q Chnftian countries; because
t..e fan&ion of rewards and punishments is more
fully revealed by the Ghriftiao religion, and con
sequently the degree of guijt in transgressing the
rules of moral duty, mtifl be greater.
But can this appeal be made by every body ?'
Can this security for speaking the truth 6e given
by every one ? Moil Certainly gentlemen it cannot.
it is impoffibla this appeal (hi: 13 id be madeorthie
ftcittity given, bv those who *e> am K â- â¢â¢?S creator and governor of the world. A :
'i'urk, or 1r.4-.ZXI, believing fiit, may he a witness, ,
and a ("hriftian renouncing the belief of it, or
throUjjtl ignorance unacquainted with it, is utterly J
incapable of being sworn inour courts of justice. j
The </es of religion can have no effeftiupoÃ a mind, r
in which no idea of religion can be found, and c
there c'in be no religion if you take away a belief f
iri.tht ex igence of a God, because it is the founda. J
tibt) of all religion. Upon this ground, Lord j
Kenyan, theprefent Chief Jufticeof England, ie- t
jeflei' a person a 6 incompetent to give evidence, t
who knew njoihing of the obligations of an oath, c
of a fu'.ure (late of rewards and punishments, h*d t
never learned his catechism, and had only heard 2
there waiafeod, and that tfrofe whq told lies would '
go to the gallows. A person difcorering a difbelief
cis time principles, (lands in the tame predicament t '
with one who is entirely ignorant of thetn, and con
sequently cannot be a witness.
If the obligation of an oath depend wholly up*
on the sense and bcliefof a Deity ; that he abhors **
falfhpod, and will punifli peijuty ; and if oath* sre |
tor the maintenance of peace arid justice ;
among men ; if clearly follows that a belief in the ,
exi/tence of God, is nece(Tary for the support i
of civil society. Every 'tring therefore that tends i
to unhinge our -belief in thifc important princi- '
pie, mad be reprobated by all good men ; because
it tends to weaken the security of an oath. â¢ Lord j j
Mansfield has asserted, what no peifon will venture !
to deny, " that no country can filV/fitl a twelve
month in which an oath is not thought binding ;
for the want of it ; If adds, mull neceffatilv dissolve
society." Whatever therefore relaxes the religi
ous sentiment upon which an oath is founded, is in-
jurious to society; because it lessens the leftratnt .
which the belief of that salutary piineiple impdfea
upon the human rapid.
It is with perjury as with all other crimes, there
are certain paths that lead to it ; and tho' there are
fume persons who may riever artive at the commis
sion of this horrid crime, yet there is reason to fear,
by their practices and example, they may be the
mtt.nt of others falling into it. One deviation from
moral redlitude neceflarily leads to another. He
who hps robbed his neighbour, will not hefnate to
deny it with a lye or an oath, if such denial may be
the means of his acquittal. Drunkenness ii often
the foundation of quarrels, which not uuÂ£requent>
ly tod in murder or manflaugliter.
The two vices that more immediately lead to
perjury, are the infamous hubits of lying, and swear
ing in common conversation. With refptdt to the
person who has been accullomed to disregard truth
in the ordinary occurrences of life, besides the per
nicious example he few to others, it is much mo e
likely he Ihould fall into tire crime of perjury, than
the man who is distinguished for ftrift veracity in
his conversation. As to the impious vice of com
mon swearing ; to fay the leafl of itâit is so ab
ford in i'ft-lf, that nothing can poflibly exceed the
guilt, unless it be the folly of it. And were it not
that it becomes criminal when viewed in its con
sequences upon civil society, wollld deserve to be
mentioned o ly to bedefpifed. It is indeed to be la
mented that so many persons of lank, and good
feÂ»fe, among us 'are adiiifled to itâThey little
thiiik" while they are invoking he vengeance of
heaverr upon thesnlelvrj andothfVs, and confirm
ing the most trivial assertions with tie awful name
of the deity, that they are scattering firebrands, ar
rows, knd death all around them. 'Man is an imi'
fatifiif animal; and the lower tanks are eternally co
pying the manners, and even the expriffiops of those
they have been taught io look upon as their fupe
riots in education ard ftileof living. Tho' wear;,
ready to admit, that persons of rank and sense who
, are guilty of this vice, if called upon to swear in a
court, would scrupulously adhere to the trjitli, yet
are they by the force of their example, doing infi
nite mifchief by inducing others to treat with con
tempt the name of the deity, who perhaps may not
be relliained from pi riury by the advantages of a
good education, and better reflection, which their
superiors may have enjoyed. It is indeed a felf
evident proposition, that an habitual pro&nation of
the name of God, By the familiar use of oaths and I
curses in common conversation, must very much
tend lo lelfen that awe and reverence of tfie fupremc
being, which is oije of the ftrongelt guards agqinft
perjncy-J- and consequently be in a high degree in
jurious to lociery. It 16 for this reason our laws
havt eodeavou ed to rettrain common swearing, and
have made it an offence punifhableby a magiilrate.
Such however is the unfortunate predominance of
cuflom, that the laws is seldom put in execution :
and this in fadl will t>e always the cafe, while men
of influence i n elevated ft a t ioni, r lead the way in the
violation of the laws. Their example like a tor
rent, fwceps away all before it, and the law feemn
to befilently repeated, by the rank, the character
and the number of the offenders.
Let the prdtrnfiOnt of a person to virtue be what
they may, if he eondufis himfelf in any manner inju
rious to his country, and forbidden by the l.aws, he is at
belt but a pretender to the charailer of a good citizen.
Hisaflions fpeaklouder than his words, and mark him
the decided enemy of social order and public happiness.
" By their. fi(iiit you shall know them"â is not less
true, when applied to detedl the pretender in patrio
tism, than the hypocrite in religion. The man who
by his numeral pra&ices is constantly infringing the
laws of order, and Spreading confuiion thro' the moral
world, contributes his utmost efforts to involve every
thing in anarchy and rum ; and whatever may be the
language of his lips, with his -vices he is fiabbing his
Country to the heart.
I oblerved gentlemen, that some oaths are called pro-
IhiCory oaihs ; inch are all oaths of office, and some
other.. This mode of exacting the performance of a
trjft, by the additional security of an oath, is untrer
fally pra&ifed by civilized nations ; and tho' by our
law the puniihment o pcrjiiry cannot be .infixed son
the-violation of such engagement, yet may it be profe
euted as a n*fde>ncanor ; and in the fight of God the
guilt is equal to the cafe of perjury, where fadls are
Kiifreprefected or concealed, in the eye of reason
there can be no difference, between a person's swearing
toafadltliat wht existed, and swearing that he will
# perform a particular act, and ilfully omitting it ;or
twearirtg that he will not perform a particular aA; and
afterwards deliberately doing it. There are doubtless
different degrees of malignity attending the crime of
perjury, as well as ail other crimes. Yet I cannot
avoid remarking that perjury in the cafe of -violated
*
and detectable crirtre this even fwesring to a dire# F
rsilhrjori, because it is ac'complnied with a perfidious tl
breach Â«f trust. In the cafe of for exam- ; t
pie, which is generally understood to be a contrail, lor
tified with the folemnitieÂ» of an oathx
guilt Can exceed the violation ofir. It is a cruel breach '
of trull, coupled with perjury ; and tends diredlly to
I deltroy the peace of families, and to tear up the very p<
P foundation of society. Contrails and oaths mull have t H
, some meaning. But if the incon-venierife of executing fii
I them jor mere whim and pleasure, be admitted a 'in j,
excuse for the breach of them ; then farewell gentle
men to all honour and horiefly. If oncof the parties
> be difchargad, the other cannot remain bound The ar
, confcquence of both partiesbeing released from cbliÂ£a :
i tions, whenever either party shall feel, orfancy hefeelt,
j an inconvenience frÂ»m adhering to iuÂ® contract, must
j be thisâthat every perfÂ»n will oe at liberty to refcino
c hts fcflemn compail wheneyer he pleases. A dodlrine j,
pregnant with the must tforrid confufion, and the en
'. tire subversion of society.
The true criterion or standard of any action whate
ver is would be therei'ult to society, ifeve
, ry oiirperfon did the fame thing. In ihisfcale, man
8 weigh his a<3ionÂ», with the utmost nicety âby this bi
â | rule he may msafure the innocence or criminality of p
\ every step he takes in life. Suppose for example, all 0|
" ! persons to abandon themselves to adulterous coursesâ
- or suppose an un 'rverfal and uuretrained intercourCe to '
t take place between the sexes : in either of these cases, Y'
s such an universal depravity of morals would ensue, as 'r
. tnuft utterly dellroy society. y<
e livery ftnglt adl therefore, coitrp-ized in either of C
j these supposed cases, must be unlawful. If one maq tfl
\ has a right to be his own avenger, every other person j;
c must have the/fame right. But if all men were to ex
- ecute their own revenge, desolation, rapine and mur c ' ]
; der would quickly overspread the land. -Every ftngle 'P
e afl of revenge therefore, is utterly repugnant to social *
. obligation. tl
From the consequences of any aflion being injuti- fj
( ous to the public welfare, if universally praSiJed, wa
infer, that e /ery Jingle action of the fame kind or de
-8 fcriptionfis criminal. The rule will held good when
applied to lying, flealing, drunkenness, and every other
e yice. For if one man has a right to ileal, to tell a lye,
e to get drunk, or to violate his solemn promises as often
as he pleases, so has every other man. But if all men
were to give into these practices, society mud be anni
' hilated ; for it could not poflibly exist, if it were en
e tirely con.p'oftd of such infamous wretches. In the
n onerrfe therj would be no furli thing as property âin
e the other no truth, or dependance of one man upon
o the words of another,, and in the third, viz. a-fociety
e consisting of drunkard ; univerfil wretchtdnefs must J
n be the inevitable consequence. b
' From these obfervatio s gent emen, we cannot but a]
perceive the deftruilive tendency of vice, in its -very C(
nature; and how utterly incompatible it is, with the j
0 interejls of society. It is at the fame time agreeable
to remark, the coincidence, the perfeil harmony, bÂ«-
e tween the precepts of heaven, and the neceflai y cenfc- c
h queuces of human anions. "
. The laws of God forbid the indulgence of our past si
fions only \nfuch cases, where their gratification wauld 0
be injurious to ourfeh'es, or our neighbours, and enjoin n
" the performance of all those duties, that are calculated ,
n to improve the heart, or promote the welfare of others. '
