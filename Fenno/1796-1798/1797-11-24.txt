Mr. Thomas Pinckaey, from South Carolina
(in the place of Mr. W.Smith, appo ::Â»â '! miniftrr
to Portugal) and Mr. Claiborne, rom Tenueffee
(a newly elected member) appeared, and took the
constitutional oath and their feats.
i'fee hour of twelve being near at hand, the
fncaker announced it, Â»nd * message was sent to
the senate, to inform them they were met arid
ready to receive the communications of the Preii
aent ot the United Stales, agreeably to his appoint
ment.
The members of the senate attended according
ly, and about a quarter after twelve th t PrefideDt

Having concluded his speech, and delivered co
pies of it to the prelidert protem. of thefÂ«nate,
and to the fpeakef of the house of reprentatives,
the prefldent retired, the speaker resumed his chair,
and the house being come to order, he, as usual,
read the speech from the chair. This being done,
on motion, it was referred to a committee of the
â B'-'ole house, and made the order for to-mÂ«brow.
Ordered also to he printed.
Vir. WH.LIAMS ohfervsd it was not usual to at
tend to much on the (day the speech was
delivered ; but h,; Ih'ould wi(h that they might
take up the refelu'ion of the senate refpeaing the

The motion was agreed to, and the resolve of
the ftnate baving been read,
Mr. Macon cbjefted to the form ofit. Ifthey
were to agree to a resolution of this kind, he hop
ed it would he in the usual form. Ihe senate,
without their concurrence to the resolution, had
proceeded to eleil a'chaplain, which was tontrary
to former practice. They ought firft, he said, to
have known that this house would agree to have â 
chaplains, before they had proceeded to an elec
tion. He called for the reading of the resolution.
Mr. Williams did not think the variation ma
terial.

FRENCH NOBILITY
By Mr. Burke's ftatcment, the French
nobility, before the revolution, were so re
educed in numbers, that they did not much
exceed 20,000, at least of full grown men ;
and he adds, that as they have been very
cruelly formed into entire corps of foldiera,
it is estimated, that by the sword and distem
pers in the field, they have not loft less than
5,000 men ; and if this courfc is pursued,
it is to be supposed that the whole body of
the French nobility may be extinguilhed.
/Several hundreds have also periftied by fam
ine and various accidents. N. Y. Pap.
The terrible tribunal of the InctyisiTioN

Those who have loft the situations which
have hel4 under that tribunal, may become
the mod a&ive revolutionists. The step
from depotifm to anarchy is but a (hort one.

complained on every return from Falmouth, â

NEW-YORK, November 22.
At a late hour last evening we received
our London advices by the way of Green
ock, which furni(h many details of informa
tion not handed te usbefureâWe (hall take
them up to-morrow.
A London paper of the 27th Sept. ftatea,
that gen. La Fayette and his companions
in fuffcring are at length delivered from their
long and painful captivity. They were re
leafedupon the 27th of Augult.
The British parliament was to meet about
the middle of this month.
From the Glasgow CourierÂ®/OSober 5, re
ceived by the Amjlerdam Packet.
Refleftions, suggested by the recent condutt
of the French government at Lille.
A crisis more awful, more important, or
more inftruftive than tbe present, is not to
be found in the annals of any nation that e
ver existed on the earth. For eight yean
past have we been contemplating events as
extraordinary as ever happened, and aftions
as monftrou? as ever disgraced the unfortu
nate nature of our species. Mock trials,
deriding justice, regicide, indiferiminate pro
fcriptiont, rivers of blood, and boasted impi
ety, have insulted intellect, and tortured
sensation. Some strong minds ( I will not
at present fay whether mistaken Â«r not) have
looked upon these horrors without (hrinking
in the hope of ultimate advantage to man
kind ; and, while the feeling heart has quiv
ered under the impreflion, have been bold e
nough to cry out, " It is to be endured, it
ought to be endured, for the good of the
world, for the fake of poftcrity."
But the iorcfight of others (a forefight
now juftified) led them not only to denounce
the diabolical means, but to deny the boast
ed end of meliorating the lot of man. Men
of reading and of refleftion have looked iÂ»-
to the page of history, have compared past
with the present times, and have seen the
fame Utopian chimeras formerly giving birth
to Ctmvulfion; and revolution*, â â fciali they
have obfe ved constantly ending in tyranny
and opprellion. Thence they have depre
cated the issue of the present chimeras in
France, and, though of different parties in
domestic politics, have set themselves to op
pose their influence with heart and hand,
with fortune and with life. These are the
real philosophers of the age ; and whether
they be ftatefmati or individuals, seamen,
soldiers, or citizens, they are the truefriends
to genuine and attainable happiness, and
their philosophy is the wisdom of ages.
If the nature of man were uncorrupt, if
he were a perfeftly virtuous and pious crea
ture, there would fce little occaiion to dis
pute the superiority of forms of government;
justice and benevolence would govern all his
aftions, and ascertain all his rights. We
know that the end of government is to crush
vice, and to cultivate virtue, whieh includes
every right of man ; but whether monar
.chy or republicanism contributes most to
this genuine end, has been a constant debate
both among the antients and the modems.
It is not my intention to take up time in a
renewal of this fubjeÂ£t,-on which I fiiall on
ly fay, that experience evinces that the feeds
of tyranny and oppreflion are at least as pro
fufely scattered in the latter as in the form-'
cr mode of government. Was there ever a
republic, however pure it set out in princi
ple, that did not Coon verge to abfolutt
power, and terminate in the despotism of
one or many rulers.
Revolutions, after blood had ceafcd to
flow, and the tumult of events to aftonilh,
are found to be little more than changes of
adminittration. When the vices of wardif
continue, the vices of peace succeed ; and
when it is too late, the people at length be
gin to perceive that the change has been
wrought chiefly for the gratification of in
triguing men, whofa education inspired them
with an ambition which their existing rank
in society did not favour. Is not the histo
ry of France itfelf, since the year 1789, an
unequivocal testimony of the jaftnefs of these
aflfertions. The firtt conftitutiou seemed to
promise the nation happiness ; but, after
the triumph of tha firft ambitious dema
gogues, what a rapid fuccefiion of tyrants
seized upon the government ! The convul
-11 on (hook the country to its foundation ;
the firmnefs of the land was loft ; the peo
ple knew not their way, but waded thro'
the quag that had been produced, from
which ifined wills-o'-the-wifp to mislead
themselves and other nations ; and (till are
they wading after these meteors.
Without renewing an investigation of the
propriety or impropriety of the war, we
feel that the burden has b:en great. In
deed it has been so much felt, that even the
firranefs of a very resolute admir.iftration
gave way to it. Twice have we feeu this
admir.iftration, agai'nit * their better judg
rhent, blive to the pfieflurc ofthe time aJ
| yififighis inajcftyto thecoudefcenfion of fend
i rag ambassadors to France. It has been said
that his miniilers were not firicerc in a de
sire of pease. They could "have but one
motive to induce sincerity, and that was the
burd;n of the war. The whole of lord
Malmeftwry's firft emliaffy is a piitnre of
the' struggles between confeientious con 5(1-
ency, attached to the lading interelts of this
; country and the melancholy deljre of ;em
porary fffpite.
But the sincerity or insincerity of the
British ministers was little to the purpose,
if there were not Xiftceritv on the fide of
Fraice. Were her rulers fineere ; The fine
at Paris, and dill more, the recent
infilts at Llfle, are decisive proofs of their
jjiliiceiity. Is there a Briton that would
have yielded; dcfpotic terms proposed
in the) French Metropolis? Is there one of us
blood dpes not boil with indignation
at what has nqw driven the ambaflador
home? Peace is not to be obtained. How
ever desirable for ns, however desirable for
the fake of humanity, it i 3 inconsistent with
the interest of the ruling fadtion at Paris,
who are intent upon eredting military des
potism and whom, therefore it behoves to
maintain the military, as they cannot other
wif* fafely defpofc of them.
Is there a man in this country whose eyes
are not now open to the designs of those who
are the present dirtdtors of French politics,
and to the motive? of their condudt ? Do
we not plainly fee the itfe they have made of
power ? and are we not aware of their dread
ofdifbanding their armies ? Yes, my country
men ! more blood is to be shed, more bur
dens are to be bome. From our position
and relative politic*, we are necessarily im
plicated in the derangements of France,
as in a street on fire, we pull down one house
voluntarily to favc the remainder, so is it
become the wisdom of the jundture to facri
fice some part of our pecuniary resources in
order to secure the reft. As we cannot ob
tainpeaceonany terms poffiWly to becompli
ed with by a great nation, in fadt on no
terms, we irt called upon by the principle, of felf
rrdtration, at -well as of honour, to produce and
to combine our means as well pecuniary as person
al, ir. order to aflert the dignity of our country,
and repel the arrogance of our enemies.
The rtitinrce* of Britaia are not to be easily ex
hau.led, is/he to bo driven irtÂ» fubrr.iffion: the ii,
indeed, again driven td the sword, and will yet
conquer, if her sons be but unanimous. It is not
some unfucctfslul attempts of invading France that
can make us despair. Jnvafion is ever difficult ;
but the glorious and unparrelleled fuccefles of our
naVy, aud the aflual pofltion of its fleets, give us
earnest thattbe day may arrive when our foes (hall
file for peace. They flatter themfrlvea we ihall
be crushed by domellic difcentenwarifing from the
neceflary burdens by which the means ofoppofing
them are to be obtained ; t-u', happily their con

the bear's ofthe nation, to draw forth with cheer

MR. BLAUTELT,
I furnifh you with the following anecdote
for your publication, as thinking it too
good to be confined ii) a small circle.
At the civic feaft lately in this town, a
gentleman observed to a citizen, that it was
a pity he had not been born in the King of
Prufiia's dominions, as his size would have
been noticed at court. Replyed, that he
then would have been a slave, and that he
had rather be thought the meanest man in
the American republic, than the ftcond in
any defpoticmonarchy on earth. The Pre
sibent of the United States nobly rejoin
ed, and I, theJirJt.
ADJUTANT GENERAL'I OFFICE.
The adjutant general having reported
the dates of brigadier general Doughty's
commiflion and brigadier general Giles's
commiflion,it appearsthey aie asearly as any

will result from their relative situations, they
are diredted to take command as brigadiers
of the detachment of militia ordered for du
ty, -and to be prepared accordingly, after
which they will receive their ordeis from
major general Frelinghuyfen, who com
mands the detachment. It is expefted that
all the returns directed by general orders,
will be immediately completed and forward
ed, that the report of the .state of the third
detachment may be made to the secretary of
war, and no excuse for omission will be re
ceived. It is with pleasure the commander
in chief received from the adjutant general
a report of the military maimer in which the
officers and dragoons performed the honor
able service, of receiving sad condudting the
President of the United States through the
state to the feat of government. Nothing
less eould be expedted from cavalry so well
disciplined j but the alacrity and adtivity
displayed on the occasion, did honor to the
fcveral troops, and claims the just tribute of
appkufe. Besides the cavalry, the diffe
rent companies of artillery and infantry, who
have also been reported by the adjutant gen-
eral Jls attending on this occasion, dtferve
and receive the approbation and thanks of
the commander in chief, for their exertions
and propriety of conduit.
By order of the commander in chief,

Last-Saturday morning, Sentence of Death
was pronounced on Bt nj amis' Bails v.
Sentence p"Jfed by Judge Rush,
on Benjamin Bailey, forthe murder of
yOST FOLHABER.
YOU have had a fair and impartial Trialâ
the Witneflei were examined in your presence,
you felefled your Â»wn Jury, and have been ably
and zealoully defended by your Council. When
we fee a man sent out of the world in the Ad
ministration of justice, undercircumftances
these, it mult be Guilt alone that bears him
down. The Evidence on your Trial, made so
strong an Impreflion, as to combine in one Sen
timent against you, the Court, the Jury, and
the Byfianders.
As you have but a fbort Time to live in this
World, and as there is no hope of Pardon from
any earthly Hand, let me urge you to seek a
Pardan from above.
It is the Consolation of the Wretched and the
Guilty, that GOD it infinitely merciful: âbut it
should be remembered, that he is merciful, not
to him who continues in the Pradlice of Sin, but
to him only who repents, and utterly forfakes it.
Be aflured, the Qutftion is not, whether you
mull repent of your Sinsâthat is certain, sooner
or later.âBut the Question is, whether it is not
better to repent in this World, where your
Uepeatance may be attended with the. happiefl
Effeftsâthan to repent hereafter, when it will
answer n<* other End, but to your
Torment.
Yea have been guilty of Murder in its mo}
horrid Formâdeliberate, cruel, and remorse
lessâYou have imbrued your Hands in inno
cent Blood, forthe Sake of a little Money ; and
though the Water of the Mountain, hath wash
ed the Stain from your Garments, and your
Hands ; yet Oceans of Water can never wash a
way the Stain of Guilt from your Conscience.
Nothing but the efficacious and all cleanflng
Blood of a Saviour, can poffibty do this -
To this Blood you mult apply, as the only Re
medy for a Soul pellutod with Sin.
Be advised therefore immediatelyâauxioufly
and solicitously, to set about the great Duty of
Repentance, and working out your falvition
with Fearand Trembling.
You have not a Moment to lofe; âExert
vourfelfâand it you have never prayed before,
itrive to pray now for the firft Time ; for
Prayer is the very Breath of Heaven â a nd with
out it, there is no Religion, 110 Repentanceâ
no Pardon on Earth.
Weep over your Sinsâand if you cannot so
much as look up to offended Heaven, perhaps
you may with Eyes towards the Earth, smite
your Breast, and both feel, and express the fer
vent Wish of the Publican.
Weep (I fay) over the Blood of Folhaber;
for if you go out of the World with his Blood
on your Conscience, it will torment and wring
your Saul with unceasing Agonies and tiorror.
You die an early Vidtim to public Justice,
and aiecut off in the Morning of your Daysâ
But to him who is pardoned byhis God, it is
of no importance at whatever Period, or in
whatever Manner lie is cut off. Nor is any
Life fuflisiently long, though it be extended to
a thoufasd Years, which is devoted to scenes of
Guilt and Folly, and at a Close of which the
unhappy Man isf'ound unreconciled to his Gob.
To ccneludeâlet me advile you to fend for
some pious Clergyman, to converse freely with
you, on your present diftrafled Condition, and
more alarming ProfpeflsâAnd who knows but
your polluted Spirit may yet become white and
pure, And hereafter ihiue in the heavealv World,
in full pofleftion of inestimable Glory and Feli
city.
The Sentence which the Law pr?fcrihes, and
this Court awards is this; âYou {hall be
from hence to the Place from whence you catne
âand from thtnee to the Place of Execution,
ajid there be hanged by the Ntc'v until you aie

FOREIGN INTELLIGEN CE
LONDON, September 22.
Yesterday advice was received at Lloyd's
of the capture of the rich homeward-bound
Port uguefe fleet* from the Brazils, by the
French. The cargoes are extremely valua
ble.
The following are, We understand, the
circumstances which led to lord Malmefbu
ry's quitting Lille. On the arrival there of
the two new French commissioners, 1 Treil
hard, and Bonniere, they waited on lord
Malmefbury, and delivered to him the ulti
matum of the directory, which contained all
the prepgfterous demands of the French go
vernment, which were originally made thro
M. Lctourneur.âThefe wereâthat Great-
Britain should restore all the conquests she
had made during the war ; and France and
her allies be moreover indemnified to a very
larg- amount. This was to be the basis of
the negociation ; but Trielhard observed,
that there were also many other points to be
discussed after these preliminaries were a
greed on. He then asked, in a very peremp
tory tone of lord Malmefbury, whether he
was prepared to accept this baiis : to whick
his lordftiip repliedâthat his inftruftions
did not allow him to do so, but that if this
wa6 the ultimatum of the dire&ory, he
would transmit it to his court. Treilhard
then said, that his lordship had better go
back himfelf to procu frefh powers ; and
when he had received them, he should be
happy to meet him again.- at LiQe. Here
the matter ended ; and next day lord
Malmefbury left the place.
On his way home, the people every where
exprefled the mod fincerc regret at the ne
gociation being broken off; but the system
of terror lately revived in France, prevented
many of those which would
have been shewn, had the public opinion
been left to its own bias. ii
A declarationfrom thecourtof St. James's
to the different courts of Europe, founded
on the refufal of the new government of
France to make peace, has been drawn up,
and will very shortly be publiftied.
Yesterday a council was held at lord.
Grenville's office, at which were prefenc
â¦he earl of Chatham, earl of Liverpool, earl
Spencer, duke of Portland, lord Grenville,
Mr. Pitt, and Mr. Dundas. Lord Malmef
bury attended the meetinjj, which commen
ced at twelve o'clock, and was not over tift .
three, when the result was sent to his ma
jesty at Windsor.
Mr. Windham is expe&ed in town this
day from Birmingham ; aR cxpreft havin-r
been sent him of the arrival of lord Malmef".
bury from Lisle.
An express has been also sent after the:
marquis Cornwallis, requesting his attend
ance: in town.
Government dispatches are to be sent oft'*
this day to his majesty's ministers at the;
couits of Vienna and Peterfburgh.
Yesterday a foreign courier set off for"
Portugal from the ambafTador's house io
south Audley-ftrert^
We understand from mod: refpeftable au
thority, that parliament will nofbe conven
ed till the month of November next, at
soonest ; nor will the public service require
any more money to be wanted till the be
ginning of January, besides what has beeif
voted by parliament.
Notwithtending the sudden interruption
to the iiegdciation, the public confidence
seems to be rapid'y recovering after an alarm
of only a few hours. The purchaseÂ« of reo,-
dy money (lock were yesterday very great;,
and the funds rose near one per cent, on the
general price of the preceding day.
It is very generally fufpeded that the firft
large speculation made in our funds for a
rife, was in a great measure nominal be
tween the persons concerned in it ; and that
the funds were run up only with a view of
taking advantage of the high price to felj.
1 here is 110 doubt but the speculation wiis
fefc on foot at Paris by those who were in
the secret of lord Malmefbury's difmiflal ;
and it is hardly necefTary to ajld, that a gang
of more profligate knaves is not in exig
ence.
The following tragi-comic anecdote of
what palÃ-d between Rewbell and Talley
rand Perigord a few days previous to tbe
late arbitrary proceedings of the diredlory,
Furnifhcs a just idea of the dignified conduS
which characterizes the present illuflrious'
sovereigns of France.
Tall, y rand Perigord havihg attended che
dire&ory in the customary d"ifcharge<>f (lis
official business, was addrefTcd by Rewbell >in
the following manner : Â«< Whit news, citi
zen ininifter ?"â" Thete might be very
good news, citizen dire&or, if you enter
tained but the wifli."âÂ» What do yau
mean : I mtan some trifling facrifices
on your part to give peace to Europe."
" Vile emigrant! exclaimed Rcwbeil, (feir
ing a candlestick) you are no better dm
the others." He immediately attempt*!
to strike the ex-biHiop, but tbe latter la(4
hold of the direftor's arm, and in the; feuf}e
dropped his pert-folio. Re-.vbell took it
up, and seized it with both hands, knoekjd
the prelate down, and continued drubbing
him until he was quite exhaw(led. It wps
with difficulty that Perigord mustered no
strength enough to creep out of the direc
torial chamber ; for the chaftifenient w')s
fofevere, that he was two days after con
fined to his bed. We have reason to kno,r
that this anecdote is perfe&ly true.
The French triumvirs having laid the
plan of the late revolution on the tabic whe re
the fittings of the dire&ory were held, fit
down to play at cards, until the arrival
their two colleagus. When Bartheleniv
entered the room, they desired him to lock
at the projtdl ; 'and in the mean time tlusy
continued their party. Barthelemy having
perilled the p.ay, declared tfyat he.could net
content to it, and he was immediately ct
fired to retire, as they.aiTured him of ih s'r
determination to carry it into effect. He
was arreted the instant he left the place.
Carntit came in foot) after, anil havingread the projeft. requeded he might be al
lowed forne time before he made lip his mind
on this fubjedt. He was also deflred to
withdraw, and being arretted in the gallery
where Barthelemy was taken, he attempted
to draw his sword. Barrns, who Jiad left
the room with an intention of following
Carnot, cam: behind him, and stabbed him
with a 1 his back. His body was
immediately tnken away, ats buried in the
vaults of the Luxemburg!). The triumvirs
then fin idled their game, and began thi revo
lution .
Gaptali Cotes has been hitherto prevent
ed, hy the want of a paffpdrt, from visiting
Paris, in his new capacity as agent for the
exchange of prisoners ; and it is now be
come a matter of doubt, whether, in the pre
sent disposition of the directory, he will ven- ,
lure to trust himfelf there.
Government, we underdand, havecomt to
a determination not to permit any French
officer, of the rank of captain, to be ex
changed, until the liberation of fir Sidney
Smith (hall have been assented to.
The known tendency of the conqueror of
Italy to rhodomontade, is infinitely t;xceedtd ,
on a late occasion, by Moreau. General
Buonaparte can only find a solitary plot in a
port-folio, while the commander of the army '
of the Rhine and Moselle, can, 011 the emer
gency of the moment, find proofs by wag
gon loads.
In the Spani(h fiiip which is prize to the
Raven, is a coffin, containing the body of
a grandee, that was sent from the Havan-1
nah to be interred in Old Spsvin. The jack
tars infid upon over-hauling the old gentle
man, as they fufpedt he has got the dujl with
him.

Citizen Representatives.
The executive direCtory has received the
twb me.Tages which you addressed to them
yesterday, concerning the exceptions propo
fetf to the dispositions of the law o? the 19th
Frftftidor, relative to emigrants. You will
find annexed the report which has been .nvde
on this fubjedt to the direftory by the min
ider of general police, to which the diredto
ry refers you. v
L. M. Revelliere Lepeax, President.
Legarde, Secretary General.
Report to the Executive Dirt dory.
Citizen Diredtors,
The law of the 19th Frudtidor, occafiou
ed by the dangers to which the royal con
spirators have " exposed the conditution of
the republic, bears the marks of that fpint
of grandeur and of wisdom, which has di
rected the progress of the two powers in the
late circumdances ; it has heen received
with transport throughout the republic ; the
Ftench people have received it as a solemn
pledge of the loyalty of the legifhtivebody,
and thanks be to it, hrttory will uot have a
single excess with which to reproach so re
markable an epoch.
The execution of thi3 salutary law will
deliver the republic fromitsgreated enemies,
the emigrants and turbulent prieds. â¢ Its
dispositions are fimpie and humane ;it calls
not for the blood of men who have only
signalized their return to the territory of
the republic,' but by trouble, revolt and af
faffi.lations. It expels them only .rom a
country, to the laws of which they refufe to
submit thepifelves.
The advantages of this measure are Â»m
---menfe, inappreciable ; its inconveniences
light and partial.
You a(k me, citizen direftors, what are
the exceptions which it will be possible to
make to the dispositions of the 15th article
of this law. You inform me, at the fame
time, that the kgifature have proposed to
except from that article the persons men
tioned in the lid of emigrants by the admi
oidration of foreign departments, and that,
the council of five hundred have sent back to
you the petitions of two soldiers who com
plain that they have been unjudly profen
bed.
To make this circumdanee an exception,
would be to dedroy the principal law.
Doubtless well founded complaints exilt ;
doubtless some citizens, public funaionanes,
a fmsll number even of the defenders of the
country, may find themselves included in
this law ; but th<: magidrates of a great na
tion, the legators, cannot facrifice to the
intered of a few citizens that of a whole na
tion. It is this day demonstrated that the
rebel emigrants and prieits ought to be ba
niflied from the French foil, or that the
constitution and the republic must beâ¢"pol
ed to the hazards of a civil war, all i-s
In Vain will it he fa id, that to except
fÂ»iim this law,fijch or such a class of citizens
is not to agree to dedroy it ; exp'rience h;is
(htvtn us that wken a principle is once at
tacked, intered and malevolence know how
to profit lÂ»y it, so as to render nu'.lthe mod j
severe law.
It is with similar exceptions that but :
lately we had nearly recalled the emigrants,
as fugitives of the Lower Rhine, as fugitives j
of Toulon, and as fugitives of the colonies. ;
Citizen Diredtors, the mod constitutional j
law is that whieh drives away emigrants â¢
from the republic.
How easy it is to deceive on qued/ons of.
emigration, by captious reasonings, and by
apparent authentic proofs ! Have I not re
cently made known to you the frauds prac
, tiled by a great number of emigrants,
by corruption, have got their names fubdi
tuted in the place of republican volunteers,
usurping the glorious title of defenders of
their country, and claiming the merit due
to such. How many other's, if the propos
ed exception fliould be adopted, would e
quivocate as to the spot of their residence,
and would by a thonfand pretences elude the
provisions of the law. By such an excepti
on all the emigrants would remain.
Yes, Citizen Diredtors, I hesitate not to
declare to you, that the fafety of the repub
lic depends upon the drift execution of the
law of the 19th Frudtidor.
The partizans of royalty and accomplices
of the late conspirators, are far from believ
ing themselves vanquished; already you
. know, that they affaflhiate in ftveral depart- j
ments, republican functionaries; important
communications which have lately come to
' your hmd, have developed to you the vad
plan of dellrudtion and death, which, by
the nxrafurcs of tSe 18th Frudtidor, you
1 prevented the bloody execution of; and
when, to arrest so many misfortunes and
1 crimes, the French nation contented itfelf
| by removingfrom its bosom its acknowledg
ed enemies, ii is feared to exercise this
grand act of jiiftice, becauff, by doing so,
they may the intered of a few citi
zens i The mod equitable law is that which j
contains the lead of injudice. None more
than myfelf, Citizen Diredtors can bear
witness of yourcondant solicitude to diftin
guilh the innocent from the guilty.
I have to the utmod of my power sup
ported this principle of juttice, and every
day lince the passing the law of the 18th of
Frudtider last, has been marked by the con
viction of a great number of citizens, that
either error or malevolence had enrolled on
the lid of emigrants.
As to any thing else, the legislative body
may be easy, you have in your hands, and
have already made use of the means of go
vernment which will alleviate that in which
the vigour of the law might appear rigid,
and which will prevent the innocent from
being included with the guilty.
As for my part, I must confefs to you,-I
look upon the entire execution of the law,
to be as just as it is indispensable. By it,
you cut the thread of those dark plots which
have been formed againd the public tran
quility,; by it, at length, the republic
throws off, without any effort, those who
were tearing her to pieces.
Dedroy this law, and you compromise
the fafety of the conditution, even to hesi
tate to maintain it, is a public calamity.

SOLDIERS,
We will celebrate the 1 d Vendemairc, the
epoch mod dear to the French : it will be
;; day mod celebrated in the annals of the
world.
It 's from this day that the foundation of
the Republic, the organization of a great
nation,* the call of a great nation to aftonifli
and console the world by its destinies, is
dated.
Soldiersâseparated from your country
and triumphant over Europe, they were pre
paring-chains for you j you knew itâyou
have spoken ; the people awaked and mark
ed out the traitors, and already they were
in irons.
You will hear, by the Proclamation of the
Executive Diredtory what the private ene
mies of the soldiery, and particularly of the
divisions of the army of Italy, were con
spiring. That preference does us honorâ
the hatred of Traitors, Tyrants and Slaves
will be in hidory qur best title to glory and
immortality.
We return thanks to the courage of the F;rd
Magidrates of the Republic, to the aimies
of the Sambre and Meufe and of tht Interi
or, to the patriots, to the representatives
who have remained faithful to the dediny of
France ; âthey have done by one blow what
we have been doing for the country thefÂ» fix
years.

LONDON, Oclob?r 2.
Mr. Vick did not carry dispatches to
France as was so industriously reported on
Friday night j but carried papers for lord
Grenville in the usual way in which that no
ble Lord tranfadts the public bulinefs. No
proposition has been made to the French ;
and it is expedted that a date paper, or a
collection of paptrs, will speedily be made
public, giving an account of the conduCt of
the negotiation at Lisle. The principal a
gents have been daily employed in the pre
paration of this maniftdo for some time pad.
Camille Jordan is said to have been im
-1 prisoned at Middlebourg soon after his ar
â  rival in Holland. Suard, editor of the
; Nonvellc Politiques, Padoret, and Boiffy
rd'Aitgias are arrived in Switzerland.
October 3.
Ycftcrday evening a French fog ef trace
arrived at Dover, by'which a M. Ivfetiue,
a French courier, brought a dispatch from
the commiffioncrs of the directory, ad4re(Ted
to lord Mai me (bury. This difpatcli was
instantly sent off by a fpeÂ«ial meffenjjer to
London, where it arrived at two o'clock
this morning. We cannot take upon U3
to state the nature? of this communication.
It may be merely the answer of the com
miflioners -to tlÂ»e- Ittter written by lord
Malmefbviry, which Ins been so much the |
fubjedt of discussion ; but to which minis
ters have inid, they expefled no favorable
answer. Tliis d.iy will prove to us, whe
ther the French diredtory have relaxed from
tn<sir demands or not. It (hall be our study
to procure the bell informatian for our rea
ders on a matter so truly interesting to them.
At the fame time a Danffti-' arrived
with passengers, and by this we have
Paris journals up to Friday hit the
inft. ' They do not j contain any interesting
news. Nothing decisive has occurred at
Udine. The armies remain in the fame po
rtions, and though there appears to be
some alarm of commotion in the provinces,
it is feeble and unsupported.
No account is yet given of the new Re
public on the left bank of the Rhine, ex
cept what the Journals have received like
our elves through the German prints, and
it seems to pass over, as st common event,
unworthy of occupying a place in the pub
lic mind.
The escort of the Deputies, under sum
mary judgment of transportation arrived at
Rochfort on the 21 ft of Sept. they were em
barked the fame day at noon, and the wind
being favorable they were expedted in a few
hours to be out of fight.âThus the execra
ble sentence of these men, without trial, is
carried into effect, and the wretched imita
tors of their tyranny in every country of the
world, will have to quote th'eir example of
injustice for the persecution ofÂ»the men
whose opinions they dread. Whether these
men were guilty or innocent iÂ« foreign to
the queflion. It is only by trial that Jus
tice could be fatisficd. [Morn. Chrtn.~]
La Fayette was liberated Aug. 27. Pre
vious to which the Emperor asked of him a
declaration.âThe items of the demand may
be conceived from the following, which was
the effedt:
DECLARATION of GEN. LA FAY
ETTE,
Dated Olmutz, Aug. 26, 1797.
The commiflion with which the marquis
de Chaftcller is intrusted, appears to relate
to three points s
1. His imperial Majesty wishes to afeer
tain the true state of our situation at Olmutz
âI am not disposed toprefer any complaint
upon the fubjedt ; the detailed circumstan
ces refpedting it may be found in the letters,
reeeived or sent back, which were tranfmit
tedby my wife to the Auftriangovernment;
and if his imperial majesty is Â»ot {satisfied
by reading over the orders sent in his name
from Vienna, I am willing to give the mar
quis de Chafteller any information he may
think proper to desire.
2. His majesty the Emperor and King,
wishes to be assured that, upon my release, I
(hall immediately set * out for America.âl
have frequently fignified this to have beer,
my intentioa. But, as an answer, onderthe
present circumstances, might seem to admit
the right of exadting such a condition, I do
not judge it proper to comply with this de
mand.
3. His majesty the Emperor and King,
does me the honor to fignify to me that the
principles which I profefs, being incompat
ible with the security of the Austrian gov
ernment, it is his pleasure that T (hould npt
re-enter his dominions without his fpeeial
permifiionâl have duties from which lam
not at liberty to withdraw myfelf. I am un
der obligations of duty to the United States
âabove all, I am under obligations of duty
to France, and I can coutradt no engage
ment inconfiflent with those rights which
my country holds over me. With these ex
ceptions, I can assure the general marquis de
Chafteller, tKat it is my invariable resoluti
on never to set foot on any territory, fub
jedt to his majesty the King of Bohemia and
Hungary ; consequently I, the underfign
cd, engage myfelf to his majesty the Empe
ror and King, never, at any time, to enter
into any of his hereditary dominions, with
out having firft obtained his fpeeial permis
sion, provided this engagement is not under
fteod to contravene the right my country
holds over me.
(Signed) La Fayette.
The Diredtory invited General La
Fayette, to return to France, and this invi
tation has been renewed since the late revo
lution. He will no doubt accept the invi
tation, and go to Paris, to acknowledge the
obligations that he is under for the inter
ference of the Diredtory is his favour,j but
we understand he is going to Spa.or Aix-la-
Chapelle to take the waters for the recovery
of his health.

Ex'irad of a letter from'a gentleman in Hol
land, to his friend in this city, dated Sep
tember 18.
" The two envoys from the southern
and middle pans of the United States ar
rived here to day from the Hague, at which
place they had waited a fortnight for the
arrival of Mr. Gerry ; they are now on their
way to Paris, hoping to be joined by that
gentleman either on their route, or soon af
ter their arrival at that city.
" Three of diredtory, viz. Rcveilliere Le
peaux, Barras, and Rubel,by means of the
armies, (who were induced by mifreprefen
tationa to believe that the legislature were
concerned in a plot for the re-eftablilhment
of royalty in France) have seized one of the
other members of the diredtory, Barthele
my. Carnot, the remaising director would
slave been seized also, had be not made his
escape ; fifty four members of the legisla
ture have been seized alsoâthe great gene
ral Pichegru is among these.
" In effedting this revolution the consti
tution has not been in the least regarded ;
the diredtory sure of the support of the ar
mies, have trampled it under foot, arvd yet
Have had the address to make those armies
believe, that it was the only way to pre
serve the conftitHtion.
"If you will .read the 69th article of the
French constitution, which forbids the
marching of troops within twelve leagues of
the feat of the legislature, you will fee how
that has been violated.
" After the feiznre of these men, an ac
cusation against them was sent to the rem
nant of the legislature, assembled in a haity
and unconstitutional manner, and without
being heard dr fuffercd to appear in their
own defence, were sentenced to banilhment
(where the diredtory pleafed)âby that le
gislature, the constitution has expressly for
bidden to pronounce any greater punilh
ment shan reprimand, arrest during eight
days, and confinement during three days.â
Wny not fend them before that court ex
pressly pointed out by the constitution
their trial ? it could not be doubted hut
that this court would also have been fuffi
ciently overawed to pronounce the will of
the diredtory. But why not fuffer them to
be heard before the legislature ? that pros
trate legislature which returned thanks for
its own humiliation. The fadt is, the accu
sation was supported by such flimfy teftimo
py, they were afraid the appearance of these
men would (hake it off. It does not ap
pear that testimony was produced against
any but Pichegru ; and as he is mod fear
ed, that against him is produced in full
length : it is a conversation which is said to
have passed between Pichegru and an emi
'gjant, while Pichegru was at the head of his
army. This emigrant has told it to a se
cond, who told it to a third, and this third
emigrant is said to have put it in writing
more than a year after he had heard itâ
and this writing is said to have been found
by Buonaparte, (who is an inveterate ene
my of Pichegru Y) To the firft Pichegru
is made to unlofom hiinfelf in his firfft conver
sation, without having ever before'feen him,
and without his being able to advance any
thing, to prove he was not a'fpy from the
Jacobins, to whom this general is extreme
ly odious, but who merely told him that he
came from Conde. The conversation was
relative to a restoration of royalty in France,
and Pichegru for a stipulated price was to
proclaim it at the head of his army.
" Would you as a magistrate have receiv
ed this as testimony on the trial of a warrant
for a (hilling.
" But the plan is said to have failed, be
cause Pichegru wished toaffociate in the plan
the Auftruns, and Conde objedted to this,

?3o seas above high water mirk, lnorderthat
this Light may be distinguished from the 80/ ten
and other Lights on ourcoaA, an Eciipfer is e
reited, which will revolve around the Limps
once in So seconds so that the light will be near

mariner about thirty fecorjds, in one revoluti

been ieeonded by others, have taken fuoh <ii.- j
tancM and beariftgs as thev thought neceiTary j
which obfervationj giving light aad fjfety are
added for the benefit of all interefted âand are
as follows
Vellels outward b.-und, from Boflon
house, and would with to fall in with Cape-Cod
the course is E. S. E. distance 15 leagues, thence
3 leagues to the Light house. When .up with
the Light-house and it bears S W a leagues dis
tance, you then fleer S S E which will carry
yot, out of the foutli channel.
Veflels inward bound, and fall in with the
back of Cape-Cod, bring the Light to bear SW
a leagues distance, then you may steer WNW
for Bolton Light-Uoufe.
II you you would wish to go into Cape Cod
harbor, you ipay keep rhe (h'jre aboard about
a mile diflant, whe-e you will have 10 fathoms
water. There is a bar lies oil" the back of the
Cape, about half a mile from the fhorÂ».
When up with Kace-point. which is very
bold, and about three leagues te theweftward of
the Light-house, aad maybe known by a num
ber of fifh houses on it, from 1 1,03 miles to
the southward of kace-point, is what is called
Herring Cove, where you miy have good an
choring half a mile from the shore, the wind
from E to N N E in 4 or even 3 fathum water.
If bound into Cape Cod harbor, your course
frÂ«in Kace-point to Wood end, is S S E 6 miles
distance, bring the light to bear E by N and
run for it about two miles, you will then be
clear ct \)~ood endâthen you must steer N E
until the light bears E by Sâthen run N W
f.r the harbor, until you have from 4 to 3 i-z
fathom* water, where you have good anchor
ing, the Lfght then will bear Eby S i-jS j or
6 niilesdiflante.
In running from the Race point to Wood
Endâafter you pass the Black Land or Hum
mucks, you will come up with a low faody
beach, which forms the harbor ; extending be
tween 2 and i niiie* to Wood-end, which is
diflicult to be diftingwfhed in the nightâlt is
very boldâyou have 15 fathom water
within half a, mile of the shore.
In beating into Cape-Cod harbor, you must
keep the eaHcrn shore aboard, until ysu get in
to j fathom water. Stand no farther to the
weflwardthan to bring the light te hear E by S
as there isl long spit of sand runs off from
western shore, which being very bold, you will
have 11 fathom water within 2 llonee throw of
(hore.
1h cale it blows so hard that you cannot beat
in the harbor, you will have good anchoring
without, from ioto 15 fathom water.
VefiVls in Boston bay and would wilh to put
ifway for Cape Cod harbor, must endeavor to
fall in with the Race. If in the night, and you
cannot fee the land, you must bring the Light
to bear E by N and run for it until you have
foundings in 14 or 15 fathom water, then steer
north east until thÂ«*Kght bears E by S then run
to N~W sos the harbor. .
At full and change, it ii high water off Race
Point at 100 cfork and 4} minutes. Vtflels in
leaving Cape Cod bound to Boston, should cal
