Giiittenmrdet complained of the citlay in
r''? printing' of the report of thp committee
infp'e&ors.
Aitbry fa!d, that the committee thought
â¢t tlieir dilty to confine- tliemfelves to an ex
trajft of the documents, without p-.ibltffoing
the fgntfmtm ; beeavife, dotibtlefs, it was'
not the intention of the councils who ccm
r.romife, to expose the parties to any dif
gra re.
Johranyme moved, that the council fTiouliT
Confine itfclf to printing the report ; and if
-.'. Ny member wished to consult the docu
ments, the Committee will communicate
them. ,
OsriSr said that the report without Ac
documents was useless; ; he wiflied to print
the whole or none.
Triffael declared, that the documents
might belong to those by whom they were
coramunicittd, and that they were independ
ent of the report He therefore opposed
printing of the documents.
? lontrnajor contended that the documents
ought to be made public.
Vladier called for the repeal of the decree
which orders the documents tp be printed.
Thi? proportion was adopted, after two
appeals to the council, and in spite of the
most violent opposition. But the council
pasTed to the order of the day upon the pto
pofal to repeal the order for printing the re
port.
Aubry rend the definitive provisions of
the resolution concerning the organization
of the national guard. The article relative
to the formation of the corps of cavalry and
the company of artillery, by which the
guard was to have been augmented, experi
enced new difficulties. As it would require
many months, perhaps, to call from ttoe
iftflerent coqjs of the arrmes the horse and
the artillery, the reporter prcpofed to take
the-a out of the 47th division.
Ta'ot asd general Jourdan insisted upon
the literal execution of the article, ant} pro- ]
posed to have the service continued by the
ftrft company of artillery and the firft. regi- '
inent of dragoons ; by whom it had hitherto
been performed.
This proposition produced debates. At
last, however, it wds adopted, with an
amendment of Le Normaod, to the effedt
that the artillery and horse (hould be fubjeft
to the rule enadied in the last resolution.
Willot, in the name of the military, pro
posed to enaft, in addition to the resolution
of the 10th Thermidor, that the disbanding
of the Genfdarmerie, ordered by the law of
the 25th Pluviofe, should extend to all the
oÃcersof the corps appointed since that pe
riod, and that the directory (hould give an
indemnity to such officers as had been at any
expense in changing their situation.
26 Thermidor I âAug- 13.-
The long debates on the tranfa&ions of
the commiiTaries of the treasury with the
company of Dijon, in which the former are
charged with making bargains scandalously 1
improvident, were this day terminated.â !
The council closed the difcufiion, and de
clared there was no room for deliberating
on the motion made for hearing the com
miflarics at the bar. The council declared
the urgency, and adoatfil .theâarcyedk of
I'l.l'. -âa-'.i. TW_&Â»Â«r former commiflSrleS"
are difmified, and are to be immediately re- ;
placed ; the dire&ory fhallcaufe them to be
prosecuted before the tribunals.
Bourdon de l'Oife complained that some
soldiers pafling along the Boulevards, had ,
Hepped out of their ranks and aiTaulted some |
citizens, on account of the colour of the col
lars of their cÂ©ats. He said that as the ex
perience of the revolution had proved that
similar conduft had always been the prelude
to civil difientions, he moved that a meflage
(hpuld be sent to the direftory to desire
them to take measures of police to prevent :
the repetition of insults by the soldiers a- !
gainll the citizens on aacount of their drefi.
Adopted.

Metz rose to speak on a motion which
flood for the order of the day. He an- ]
nounced, that the enemies of public tran- 1
quillity do not ccafe to put in praftice every 1
thing which may tend to spread alarm a- !
mong the citizens, and to inspire them with
a mistrust of the paternal intentions of the
legislative body. In the department of the '
Upper and Lower Rhine, faftious persons
overrunning the country, spread the report J
that the legislative body feck to establish a
reigning religion, to make another Bartho
lomew's Day for the Protestants. They 0
then prevail on them to sign petitions which
they do not understand, filled with declama
tions against priests and emigrants. The 0
orator then related asa ft not less important. "
Although the legislative body has declared
that the pay of the troops fliould have the
prefer"" :e, the troops do not however re
ceive any thing, and they are told to resort
to the legislative body. He moved, that a
meflage be sent to tho directory, requiring
information refpe&ing the delay experienced (
by the troops in the discharge of their pay.
Adopted. *
The municipal adminiftratio* of the com- -
mune of Saintes transmitted to the councih
some new details, relative to the troubles
attempted to be excited by the anarchists t
in this commune on the 27th and 28th ult.
at the fame time a copy of several orders ~
and proclamations which serve to maintain
public tranquillity. They conclude by af
furirig the council, that they may rely on
their attachment, as well as on that'of all
good citizens, who will remain faithful to _
the constitution of the 3d ye?.r.
Duranty denounced an inftilt which he
had received frSm an officer of the guard
of the legislative body, who, notwithiland- /
ing his being a rcprefentative of the people, he
ordered his tjoops to arrtft him, and, on
â  their refufal to obey this illegal order, h;d
: can fed 'them to be puuifted.
This denunciation was referred to the

the report relative to the meflage of the di

is employed in the difcuflion of this fubjeft ;
â¢ we eannot lee in the present circumstances
. the advantage or the necessity of such a dif
r cuflion "which seems to us calculated only to
alarm ar.d difgud the city of Paris, and to
increase the chances of danger to the legis
lative body. If it is threateaed by any per
ils, they do not arise from fitting in this
commune, the immense population of which
if, on the contrary, a security calculated
to impose upon its enemies, and where the
force of opinion by it is surrounded
is a bulwark still more powerful.

LONDON, August 25 â28.
Storace and Braham have been very un
fortunate in the firft duet they were engage*!
in out of this country. They were imme
diately sent to prison on their arrival at Ca
f lais, in their way to Italy. The joint me
lody of their fafeinating drains could not
supply the want ps a passport.
tn the late quairels on black collars,
r which have now entirely fubfidcd, the in
, habitants of Paris did not take any part.
A curious developcment has taken placg
in the American legislature, on a very ex-
traordinary fubjeft. It appears that Mr.
.Blount, a member of the senate, and others,
entertained the design ofinducing the Brit
ish and the Indians to attack the Spanish
[ fettlemcnts in the Floridas and Louisiana.
Some fay the objeft of this enterprise was
' to furnifh a pretext to the Spaniards for re
â  fufing to give up to the BritiHi certain posts
' agreed to be evacuated. But the political
parties, which run very high in America,
' pretend that the projeft had 3 very different
purpose in view. The English party in A
merica fay, it was entered into in hopes of
1 embroiling either France or England in a
war with the United States ; and the French
party affirm, that it was promoted by the
English fattion to aggrandize this country,
at the expence of Spain. Each charge
the odium of the measure upon their oppo
nents, whom they accuse of being bribed,
the one fay with French, the other fay with
English goIU. It is very manifeft, that if
the Spanish settlements had aftually been
attacked, the tranquillity of the United
States would have been endangered ; and,
whatever might have been the obje&s of the
plan, it certainly was abase, treacherous un
dertaking. The disclosure of it has aston
ished the Americans, by whom it is univer
sally reprobated ; and the mercantile inter
est in London will, no doubt, rejoice at the
failure of a plat, which, at this time, would
have given a terrible blow to our commerce.
Mr. Blount has been expelled from the sen
ate, and impeached. We shall give the
proceeding at length in our next.
The late lord Mountmorres was one of
the most rigid and systematical economists
living. His manner ofpafling a day in the
winter time was nearly thuÃ : Equiped with
-Â» Water proof boots, and an
umbrella of huge diameter, he bade defiance
to the inclemency of the season, and whiled
away the mornings in visiting the new shops
in Piccadilly. He took his dinner five
days out of seven at the Piazza coffee-houfe,
and regularly appeared at about half past
eight at one of the theatres, but if the even
ing loured, tie found his way under the
cheap and convenient shelter of the colon
nade, tÂ« one of the stage boxes at Covent
Garden. With these peculiarites, there is ,
reason to believe that he did " more good
by Health," than many who had five times
his fortune.
The posthumous works of Mr. Burke,
which are to be laid before the public in the
ensuing winter, consist of another pamphlet
on French affairs, and a Journal kept by
Mr. B. for many years, entitled, " His own
times which contains many details ref
pefting the political scenes in which he was
an aftor, as well as an observer. To these
the Editors, Drs. King and Lawrtnce,
prefix a life of Mr. Burke ; which, if wor
thy of the fubjeft, cannot fail of adding to
their reputation. The whole will make a
large quarto volume.
It appears by the last letters from Rome,
that the Pope has of late passed some time
at Monte-Cavillo, to recover from the con

seized with, and which, added to the drop
sy in his chest, announces the impending
difTolution of Pius VI. Peaceable citizens
feel the more uneafiuefs on the approach of
this event, as symptoms of revolutionary
commotions begin already to appear, and
the moment ofthe Pope's death is anxiously (
waited for by Buonaparte to unfold and ,
execute the grand proje&s he has said to ,
have. All perfens able to leave Rome, de

the cataftrophc they dread.

" 24 ThermidorâAuguft 11.
" CITIZENS DIRECTORS, ,
" Profoundedly affli&ed by the evil heap
ed upon the republic, and by the progress â¢
of royalifm, the army of Italy has presented <
addresses, supplicating you to adopt the <
proper measures for consolidating the con- '
ftitution, which is now fllaken .to its basis. 1
Witnesses, and in a manner, the vift'iis of <
the affinations committed by tlje murderers 1
of the fonth, the coiiqnerors of Lodi and 1
Areola befeeched you to protest their rela- j
tions, daily immolated by the daggers of (
those atrocious ruffians, who are armed by
the priests and the fuppor.ters of the antient
tyranny.
" More patient, Vhe army of the Rhine
and Moselle has not hitherto communicated
to you the grief which it has felt. But,
citizens directors, there is a time for every
thing, ntid the measure is now full. We
have heard the eppeal which the divisions of
Angcreau, Joubert, &c. have made to you
âwe fuffer like tbem. If, deeply interested
by the dangers of their country, they be
ready to march into the heart of the repub
lic, to flop the effufion of the blood that in
undates it, you may. be/ a (Tared that we
shall not remain indolent fpe&ators of their
labors.
"With the refpecfc that is due to the Gift
magistrates of a free people, we supplicate
you to do justice to our claims, to tfiSJa?
them known to the patriotic members of
both councils, that, in concert with vou,
they may consider of some remedy which
may be instantly applied.
" Having conquered two-thirds of mili
tary Europe, how could it be conceived that
enemies should dare to ?magine they had
gained their cause ? They have, however,
obtained a great part of what they demand
ed. In a short time, the monarchy would
have been established. What a dreadful
profpeft is presented to us by the firft pro
ceedings of the prsfjnt legislature !
" Citizens directors, notwithstanding your
folicitudcs, the children of the republic, its
supporters, are vilified in the interior, and !
are destitute of every thing upon the frontiers
which their courage alone has given to their
country. The obje&s which ought chiefly
to have fixed the attention of our legislators
have been put aside ; and far from following
the' line of eoflduA which the happiness of
the people prescribed to them, they have
dwelt upon the most frivolous topics. Many
of them have been exclusively employed in
gratifying the most odious passions. The
public good, which ought to be the order
of the day, has been replaced by a thirst of
vengeance. All that love of liberty that
charafterifed the former assemblies of the
republic, is extingnifhed. The constitution
and the sacred rights of the people are no
longer refpe&edâWho knows but, one of
these days, they -will order us to go to mass ?
â-they have already made us fajl !
" Our finances, so much mismanaged,
were almost exhausted. A civil war was
scarcely terminated in the weft, when ano
ther recommenced in the south. Foreign
agents endeavored every where to mislead the
public mind. What has been done to reme
dy these evils ?âMore than twenty fittings
of the council of five hundred have been
employed on hearing reports on priejis, on
bells, and on emigrants !âEmigrants and
Priests ! Those who delivered Toulon to
the Englifb, and A face to the Imperialijlsâ
thofe who have involved us in the war, and all
its miseries, have been recal'ed by a decree, wel
comed and honored.âThe bells most be re
cftablifhed, while no plan of finance is adopt
ed, and though the defenders of the coun
try should want every necessary. The pay
of all the armies is several months in arrear,
and no clothes are delivered to them. The
hospitals are not attended to, and our lick
and wounded brethren die for want of pro
per support and assistance. Are the civil
hospitals better supplied 5 What are the bells
to us ?
" The conquerors are naked, and defect
has been profitable only to the vanquished.
In feveralquarters provisions have constantly
and totally failed. If the troops have sub
sisted, it was only by depriving the inhabi
tants of the countries in which they were,
of some of the articles necessary to their ex
istence. What would be thought, then,
if we should speak of the Milliard,
which was promised us with so much ear
neftnefi when our services were wanted ?
None of us can any longer rely on the pay
ment of it : and it even appears, that the
only reward they reserve for us is shame
and contempt.
" But private interest would still be si
lent, were not the honor of the country
concerned. How have the defenders of the
country been treated in the interior? Worse
even than the soldiers of Conde, whom
they have beaten, They have been vilified
in one place, proscribed or assassinated in
another, and every where infnlted, when
they appeared in the most refpeftable uni- 1
forms. No, citizens directors ! we have 1
not renounced the honor of being French '
citizens : we know what is due to usâde- 1
gradation belongs not to our charadter. ]
But even the legislative body, in debating ]
for five days upon the march of the troops
which passed within 12 leagues of them,
have proved that they viewed us only with
terror, we may fay even with horror ? Are .
we then, foreign troops, or enemies of pub
lic liberty, that they treat us with so much
severity ? We founded and we maintained
that liberty, and no power in the universe
shall tear it from us. Ought we not to be 1
astonished when we are declaimed against in ]
the national tribunal by emigrants, the pre- c
tended representatives of the people whom <
they detest. t
" Royal terror has been substituted to 1
an anarchical terror, of which we are equal
ly the enemies, Such are its effefts, that t
the tribnnals every where acquit assassins z
and conspirators, while they ftriice f
pity all wliq are fnfpefted of patriotism, of t
being purchasers of natioaai property, or t
merely of being moderate friends of the t
constitution. In support of wjhat we ad- t
vance, we refer to the judgment pronoun- a
ced in favor of the conspirators Brottier, a
Dunan, and Lavileharnois, the known a- t
gents of Louis XVIII. and that in favor 1;
of the priest Poule, who attempted the life
of the representative of the people Syeyes. c
The purchasers of national estates are every ii
where plundered, and excluded from offices d
of trust ; while the emigrants, recalled by f
new laws, exercise almost every public furic- f
tion. So great indeed is the effedl of this t
royal terror, that when the law upon politi- si
cal and literary aflVmblies was presented to v
| r the council of five hundred, it was paffcd
t I without the necessary forms being observed.
, One member only offered to speak against
z ! that violation of the liberty of the people,
1 j but he was not heard ! It belongs to the
, . present period alone to have produced fucli
f 1 examples.
e i "Ten thousand officers, who have no
f j reward for their services but the wounds
i â¢ which, they are covered, languish in thein
-1 , teiior, without support and without fuc
: ' cour.
- I Â« What fate, then, awaits those whose
- j zeal has so long and (till detains them under
: the standard of liberty ? We know already,
r that several officers have been replaced by
men who are not known in the republican
t armies, others will soon be,replaced by
-â¢ those emigrants whom they h ve combated
rf Our enemies no longer disguise this plan,
f which they have begun to carry into effeft.
, In the debate upon the Gendarmerie, did
i not several members of the council of five
hundred declare, that it was necessary to
- place at the head of that corps all theoffi
t cers who had served in it before the revolu
-1 ; tion, whatever might be their opinions '
> We are then about to fee the aristocrats
- f androyalnls reiWd to their commandâall
' those who fled to the different courts of Eu
-1 rope, a/feing alms of the enemies of their
â¢ country ; those, in fine, whom we have
for fix years combated. It has been said in
â¢ the tribune of the council or" the ancients,
| tllat all those who pojfejfed virtue and talents
waited only for thepropitious moment in -which
i they might return to the fa-vice of their country.
â  What then do ivcpojfefs ? Wounds ! If, then,
â¢ we boast no titled anceffry ; if we have nei
. ther gold nor affeftion for king; : it is not
r kT r" 5 16 j e " J ,Â° y he b!effin S s of peace ! No

' "We had reason to expeft, from the

: rious peace : but what enemy will treat, with

" F^ e / e n we doubt not, wiflt
that the lafb of us should remain upon the
frontiers, and expiate, by his death, the
crime of having vanqsifhed the kings, their
protestors. O country! O defenders of
the country ! you are then about to be de
livered by those detestable being, to the fa
telhtes of tyranny. The despots whom
you have so often humbled, are about to
put their yoke of iron over those brave
heads which have been covered with so ma
ny laurels. Perfidious wretches ! they speak
of their attachment to the constitution,
which they undermineâwhich they tear
leaf by leaf, while they continue to invoke
it. No, citizens direaors ' we will not '
endure this. We require other pledges
than hypocritical protestations. We are

to : I must confine myfelfto discuss, pursu
ant to your orders, whether there exist lawÂ»
again ft the abuses of the press ; and oafe
they do exist, whether the article under con
sideration is to fall within those laws.
" You are not ignorant citizens direa
ors, that there is nothing more excites the
indignation of all good citizens, than the
daily abuses of the sacred right, conquered
from defpotilm, and one of the most precious
fruits of the revolution, to express and mul,
tiply our thoughts, refcycdfrom the inqui
litonal fetters of cei.fure, and to exercifc,
with refpea to the depositories of pâbli p1 > ilrpofitories of public autKisrity, th;

but in proportion as an institution is great
and ufeful, its corruption and degradation
becomes more criminal. It is from, this
principle, that the poisoning of springs and
rivers at all times been" claifed among
the blackest crimes, as by this heinous deed
the sources of fertility and life are convert
ed into elements of death and deftruaion.
' Struck by this disorder.the Reprrfentatives
ofthc Nation have more th:n once beirn engaged
in ilifcaffiotu tesding to remove it. They have
ennfidered this important aueflion in its double
relation to the public intere'l of the country,and
to the private interest of the public funflionaries
and citizens; they have viewed the mifchief
which may be done with the press, either by se
ditious provocations or hv calumnies and fesn
dal ; but in this last point' of view they have
found their attempts obftraaed by obstacles hi
therto thought infurmoantable, and the only re
futt of their legislative exertions on this head, is
the law of tie 28th Germinal, fourth year, the
fifth article of whieh is as follows:
" Authors, who fhill allow themfelvei to
compose, and in general all persons, who (hall
print, diflribute fell, hawk about, or difirihute
writings containing prevocations, deemed crim
inal by the law of the 27 Germinal, (hall be pro
feciitcd in manner and wife as tlw said law di
re ils.
" The provocations, judged criminal by the
id article of th- law of the Germinal, are
thoi's /hi h haÂ»e for their ohjeil.â
The dilFolution cf the National Representa
tion, and of the Executive dire^iory.
" The murder of all or any of the members
which compose them. I
" The rtftorition of royally.
*' The re-eftablilhment of the Constitution of
J 793- i .
" Thereftcration Â»f the constitution of 1791,
; and of any form of government different from
that which is eliablifhed by the constitution of 1
the third year; 1 1
" The invasion of public property : <
" The pillage and spoliation of private pro- i
perty, under the name of Agrarian LaÂ« Â», or in (
a-.iy manner whatever.
" Of all these criminal provocations, the firft j
is the only one with whieh I fhal! compare the I !
aiticle inserted in the " as being j 1
the only one any wayconnefled with the infer- Â£
rr.a'ion, which the Council of Five Hundred de- 1
fires to obtain. ,
" Now after hiving perused with the utmeft ;
attention the article under confideratior., Ican
not find, that it contains any thing tending to r
provoke the difloliition df the National Repre- '
fentation. I found in this article 1 severe
and bitter censure of some operations of the.Le- d
piflative Body, fereral of which remain as yet p
mer< projeÂ£U or refolations; but I have not been 0
able (0 discover any expressions, which, on re- w
presenting these a<s\s as daneerous for the public 1
weal, proposes as a remedy the diflolution of
the authority from which they proceed. 0
" That this article is written in a bitter and t<
reproachful tone, which but little belongs to a y
writer who speaks of the Representatives of the p
nation, I (hall not undertake to deny or juftify. c ,
I had merely to enquire, whether there existed
a crime, and consequently matter for a crimin-
*1 prosecution, Jnd this qutfiion I find myfelf
obliged to decide in the negative. ti
" This infta.ice, however, chofsn from a fc
thousand others, offers one advantage, namely ar
this, that it proves the infufficiency of the laws ar
on this head. You are Â«ot ignorant, Citizens
Direflors, thit there exists great numbers of
far more criminal, b*caufe their crimes
and their pernicious results recur daily, who 7J
make it their to defame the firft autho- di
ritiesofthe RepublK., totalumniate the Kepre- tu
fen'atives of the people of theirMagiftrates, to ne
recofrn'.ea murder and aflaffination, to discredit vc
the purchase of National Domains, "to <Cttaek the
Republican tnanners inllitutions and denrmina
tions, to ridicule your arretes, to excite a civil en
war, and to protract that with Foreign Powers. an
And yet all these crimes remain unpunished, ow- ga
ing to the infuffici*ncy of the laws, though un- an
der the present cjrcumftances they are tar more tjfc
culpable than they might be at any other peri
od" tir
" You have compelled the most formidable ene
mies of the republic to for peace. Nrgotia- Â°P
tions, on which depend the fate of Europe, are pe;
opened under the auspices o r vidlory. You ap
proach the nsomcnt when, after haviDg dilated a
glorious peace, you will fee humanity recovering
from the calamities of a dreadful hut neceflary
war ; and it is at such a time that infamous wri
ters lead allray thu public opinion, deceive the so- f ro
reiân powers on the moral (lreogth of government, â¢
inspire them with ejtravagant hopes, by calling
to recolleelion an order of things which isabolifli- Â°*
ed forever-; inflame paflions which peace would Wi
allay, and eonfumnoate their execrable wotk by ed,
promoting distrust and di'.eord between the two on
main frripgs of the political machine. ,
" The indignation of the Council of Five Hun
dred has been roused by an article, which cenfurcs
their operations; but what will be their feelings
on reading the fo'lowing paflage, literally extracS- of
ed from a public print, which I received this
moment from onÂ« of your commiflioncrs:â ,
"We had in France a monarchy .founded I4hun
dredyears ago, and which ujider the reign of the
Bourbons, had attained the most resplendent glo- trie
Ty ; the French conftitution,it is true, was no more the
drawn up in writing, than that of Lycurgus; j, en
but it was attefled by the records of history, and q <
by thoufan .'s of public monuments Among thi Â°
three coiftitutions fabdituted in Its place since war
1789, the'.e is none, in the fabrication of which rive
the people have not been grolsly defrauded in their so t
rights.âThat of 1791 was manufactured in open w j t ]
co.ntradiilion to the inftruiftioÃi and powers recei- ,
ved, and the o;her two without any inftrudions or â¢
powers at all. Whatever attempts again ft the mo- Â°' 1
narchy were made Vy the firft or constituent as- the
fembly, it prefcrved at least the eflence of that mer '
form of government. The second r-flembly, tho' f a jj,
more audacious, swore even to preserve it, and ,
proscribed only the person of the monarch. But er ,
the third, called the national convention, an im- mat!
pure compound of debauched ruffians and atheists, uate
inviud by a tyger (Orleans) and influenced by the y en
the attraftioiis of immense booty, after having OUJ
terrified the nation by numberless maflacres, abo- p
lifted monarchy, not only without instruCtions Â£m l
and powers, but alio without any miflion whatev- on t
er, and completed its outrages against the monarch nia,
by the most cowardly and mod cruel aflifiination JJ
Â« Ye new Â£,ntlemen of the council of elders, j^ ren
lay your hands-on your hearts and. dare, on your , .
own principle,: of an absolute nullity, to maintain c, "i
the validity of that abolition. Can you, agreea- both
bly to the moral principles you have always pro- \S
fsfled, excuse that interdiction and that murder ? o bvi.
Your Clence on these two points (hall serve us {a | ne
fftr an answer. The nation will itfelf in due time .
and place examine, id, Whether these men are 'Â°"S
able and worthy to make eonftitutions and laws ? lumc

they have cejnented with the blood of our bed ci- qÂ£ }â

The reftittition of the important fortrefs ! )< *^ <
of Mantua, and the acquisitions which
Austria h*s made in Italy at the expence eel
of Venice, indemnify her amply for the loss ' on '
of her former dominions in the low Coun- du "
tries, and the Milanese. The frontiers of S en
the Imperial pofleffions in Italy will, neC(
henceforth extend westward as far as the ex . lt
Oglio, southward as far as the Po, and east- min
ward probably as far as the point where that ever
river discharges itfelf into the Mediteranean, tere
so that the city of Venice will be contained tac ' <
witln'n the Imperial frontiers. The line of attai
demarcation being thus drawn, the country emi!l
of Brescia, the Veronese, and in general wa ?
the whole extent of domination which for- l atic
merly constituted the Venetian Terra Firma in
fall to the ftiare of Austria; while 011 the o- mor(
ther fide the Venetia part of Iftria and Dal- ant *
matia, together with all the small 1 (lands fit- ''S 0 '

Venice, as far as Ragufa, form a prodigi- '

Emperor to extend hereafter his conquests ne nc
on the one fide into Turkish Dalmatia, Bos- dut y

By this new demarcation, the political edan
strength of Austria is greatly increased, by IS
being rendered more compadl and more fit 1
both for attack and defence. c
Whatever may be the eonfequencf, it is '
obvious that the House of Austria has at

Nautical Improvement. fever
ihe substitution of Hadley's 03ant in the fuppl
room of that -very defective and dangerous Robc
instrument Davis's Quadrant, has been a
principal cause to which the improved con- f!"/ 1
dition of navigation is to be attributed.
The pofieflioti of the means of obtaining J acc
a correft obfervat.'on of the heavenly bodies Owe,
at sea, has led to the discovery of other ob- Keppi
je<Ss than that which formed the original
point of enquiry. John
Still the science, under all its present ad- B '(y
vantageous circumstances, is susceptible of !
additional improvements ; and every at- !
tempt, however trivial it may be, to give ' A
perspicuity, is entitled to praise. Â° I '*â 
Among the deflderata which have laid o- *
pen to enquiry, that of obtaining a correct Oc9
observation of the fun in foggy or hazy
weather, when the real horizon caanot he j.,
ascertained, has not been the least. The p o nÂ»t
want of this has been always the most par- next^
ticnlarly felt when and where it was mod Oi!
prrticularly needtd. A mode has now "J
