THE pendulum is, however, admit,ted by Mr. Jef
ferfon to be liable ;p uncertainties, for which he of
fers no remedies : How does it appear that these
- uncertainties are not more important than the cau
ses of errors, to which his attention has been di
redtud i
r 3d. " Machinery, fays the report, p. 8. and a
- power are neceflary, which may exert a small, but
conftsnt effort to renew the waste of motion, but
~r so that they {hall neither retard nor accelerate the vi
brations."
But it adds in the next pjige â" To eflimate and
d obviate 'his difficulty is tbe artifl't province." What
is this, but ,10 fay that the fixnJmrd of tbe United
Stales ih ifl be the pesduium of some clock, made
by-Mr, Leslie, or some other artist, thus discarding ,
at once all reliance upon the principles before ad van
n ced ? The difficulty of afcenaining the center of
â¢- oscillation, (which he admits to be impossible, un
lefj in a rod, of which the diameter is " infinitely
T small-") he thinks however can bfc obviated by Mr.
Leslie, the watch maker.
Mr. Jefferfon then proceeds to apply his stan
dard.
( I ft. To meafurtt of capacity. These he propo
ses should be fowjided with re&angular fides and
fcoltom, for which he gives the following reason :â
Cylindrical measures have the advantage of superior
Jlrength ; but fqunre ones have the greater advan
" tage ot enabling every pne, who hajs a rule in his
pocket, to verify their content}, by measuring them."
Did it not occur to this profound mathematician,
that a man, with a rule in his pocket, could, as ea
_ lily meÂ«fure the diameter and depth of a cylindrical
.is the fides and depth of a square box ?
2d. -,To iveights. The of weights is
proposed to be a definite partion of 'rain-water,
weighed always in the fame temperature. " It will
be neceflary, fays he, to refer these weights to a de
terminate mass of some substance, the fpecific gra
e vity of which is invariable T rain-water is such a
t substance, and may bf referred to every where, and
through all time.'' But the temperature is nut dft
-5 ned ; rain water is varied by several causes ; dull,
infefb, &c. will create a difference in its weight,
j The French, in their !atÂ® plan, have outdone Mr.
n Jefferfon ; their standard is difldled water, afcertaiii
f ed by a defined temperature.
34. The report proposed to change
the value of "the dollar, or ratjyr to cwn the dollars
â¢f the United States of a different vrJiv- from the
L current dollars. The effect o"t this fyftert lo which
f he could not have adverted, wÂ«m!d bÂ« to the
debtors througfcout the United Sutes pay mi* for
. all exiSiÃg engagements than they' had
to pay, for he proposed to make,an addrtion-oFhvh
, grains of silver to the proper weight of the dollar,
without a proportional augmentation of its K-gal
value. TlieincoÃvenienceÃ of this plan were afirer-
wards judiciously pointed out in the report on the
' mint by the late secretary of the treasury, whose fyÂ£
tÂ«m was preferred and adopted by congress.
t Notwith(landing the numerous defedts and errors
in Mr. Jefferfon's report, he seems to have been ee-T
ry liberal in his extracts from pre-exiftirig wotks.
e Almost the whole of that part of the report, which
t relates to meqfures, is evidently copied from reportt
f of committeet of the house of common:, which were
i made to the years 1758 and 1759, which commit,
tecs he Hates to have been affilted by able mathe
maticians and artists : he subjoins, 46 that the cir
cutnftanccs under which these reports were made,
entitle them to be considered, as far as they go, as
, the best written testimony of the standard weights
Â» and measures existing in England, and as such would
be relied on by,him."
After making free use of these report, and
dating all the varietiesof measures in England, he
candidly coafeffes, " that he is not informed whe
ther there have been any and what alterations of these
, measures, by the laws of our Jalet." Now, this
wss certainly a very essential part of his dtuy : if,
tnftead of ether hurrying his repott, to make a dff
play of prodigious fnduftry and wonderful intuition,
or devoting his time to visionary speculations, octo
the altering and reforming of all his calculations,
to adapt them to Â»1!? French projea,'he had fought
for the laws of the American Rates, relative to the
fubjeft, he might have obtained much ufefgl infor
mation, on which congress would been enabled to
. ai Â» whereas, his report contained fa little that was
i Â°i * n y real ttt'hty, that congress, at the
r of fix years, have not derived the fmalleft'advan
r tage rrom his labours. It is thÂ» more furprifinif
. that he (hould have neglected this effeÃtial duty, be
-1 cause, on another occasion, when anxious to vindi
Â» cate some of the dates from the reproach of having
, ,he Â«Â«Â«y wÂ«h Great-Britain, he was vÂ«ry
, diligent in procuring every date law, record of
1 court, and document which might tend to support
his favorite do&rine
; We (hall now take leave of Mr. Jefferfon and

'' COLLA 1 ERAL ciicumllances are often pnw
if etful corroooratiyes of direst evidence. It is there
:- fore 01 corrftquenee to (late, that an accident ha>
, recently brought tinder view a passage in one of the
t- papers written with every apparent ey.iion^ainft
h Mr.jeffcifonin . 792, jâtt before the lad eledtcr.
y c i a rrchcent, when it was uncertain whether ge
,
" - ,
â¢ -Iâa! Waging!o" v/osld serve again. Th; wrifsr,
though an exptttit a.id inJuftrious opponent < f
Mr.cJefTerfon, admits, 'hat Mr. Adams entertains
0 whit he ingenicvjlt calls " fpecvlative doubts con o.
rr cerninjr tile pvotdSrl? fucccfs of the repul.ican the- r
3 ory." Pr-adical..politicians soon aitu to execute
r their ta ::\tal Speculations. The paper referred to
. was the iir.t of a series of efTays, published under
n thfe fignatare of Catullus, in the Gazette of the
United States. Who was the writer of Catullus <( .
does not appear, but it is perfe6lly # certain that the
letters of Phocfbn (since published in a pamphlet PÂ£
b October 1796 without that signature) contain en
tire paflages of the eflays of Catullus, without the
usual inverted commas Â£"3 or any other marl: of
1- quotation. The presumption that and Ca
iiilhis arc the fame person or perfonAeppears to t j y
â¢, be perfectly fair and irrefiSable. no ef- del
is -lential fclie entire contents of Cs- Of
n tullus and an equn! quantity of the efTays of PhÂ«- gat
y cictn. Matters subsequent to the publication* of Juo
Catullus are found, it is true, in P.iocion and in j ' "
the pamphlet made up of what was firlt "given in P a
â r the gazettes under that signature. They contra- Jus
e didl each other only as to Mr- Adams. Ca'ullus th<
admits that Mr.' Adams may doubt the probable . the
f- success of the republican theory. Phocion and the po
n pamphlet declaim a little' about Mr. Adams's re
1, publicaniim, and quote n few paflages, which only
tend to render his books something less imprbdent _
âbat so far as they go, also render it abfo!utely and
palpably inconjijlent. But the efTays- of Pho ion
and tlie revised pamphlet-copy of part of his efTays
do not explain away any'of the hereditiry paflages A
of Mr. Adams's books, nor do they answer the
â  objections, which have been refpe&fully submitted
to you. Phucion, whoever he may be, iS a man
of pietty ready and he does not want zeal, Ai
time or induflry ; for he has already published twen
ty-four long efTays. Whether he cannot falisfaiSo- re '
rily explain Mr. Adams and countervail the evi
l_ deuces of the monarchical and ariflocraticiA princi
ples of that gentleman, or whether he is unwilling
to do fÂ» from a fimilarityof principles, or from fume
's other views, are qutllirfns before tht clcftorS and Hi
y the world. ful
Another collateral circumflance worthy of feri- f o<
'* ous reflection, is drawn from some ideas, which i."
n arc uiklerftood to have been published in Boflon in _,]â 
, s certain edays under tl;Â« signature of Publicola, and r e;
1( i which have been sfcribed.to Mr. Adams, jun. toi
-a They were written as a partial reply to " Paine's '/
Â»- Rights of Man,'' in 1791 ; and have been since
republifhed in London with the following title and
l " motto in .1793. They were evidently considered p a
in England as calculated to defend the British con tic
/flitution, as it then flood, from any material changes hi:
"*â¢ .jjralterations. The title is as. follows : " /InfiOer
tol'ainr's Rights of Mon, by 'John /,Idams, esquire, o r
> originally printed in America." Motto. "It is C o
1 not a mechanical horror againfl the name of a king
1 or of ariflocracy, nor a phfical antipathy to the
found of an extravagant title, or to the fight of an .
1C \nnoecn\. ribbfind, thai can author ifc a people to lay
! Â» violertt hands upon the confli: utiou." This bqok

that any poli ieal evils in England Could
