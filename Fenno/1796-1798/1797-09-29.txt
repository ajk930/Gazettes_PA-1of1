FRIDAY EVENING, Sfptfmbfr a 9.
The following filly fabrication has been
copied from some Jacobin print 6f England :
an American has tacked to it " State
of France," and it is now circulating with
great industry, all over the country.
" V Slate of France.
Extraft of a letter from a young nobleman

have remained in a (late of aftonifhmer.t
ever since my arrival in this country. Oh !
what a number of fibs our ministers have
told : They said a country could not live
happy under French principles. On land
ing at Calais I expefted to fee the fields
burnt up and barren ; but what was my
surprise to fee them covered with the fineft
verdure, and bearing the richest crops. The
country between this and Lisle resembles a
garden. From what M. Wndham told me
I thought the people would all be .clothed
in rags, and ornamented with blooay dag- |
gers : that they would have famine, diftrult, '
and wretchedness in their looks : instead of |
this, they are a more open, merry set than our '
own countrymen ; they have no dread of
Botany Bay for opening their mouths, nor
a baftile for making a wry face ; neither do
they fear spies and informers ; and they are
much better clad ana fed than they were
formerly. After what I have heard in >
England, I can scarcely believe I am in
France. We have here delicious wines and !
sumptuous dinners ; the women are beauti
ful, engaging and elegant, and the men are
polite and obliging. The fun fliines in Lisle
the fame as it* London, and the people
walk upon two legs, tbnugh the former it l
inhabited by republicans. The birds sing ;
and waters flow, jpft as if the people lived in
a state -of civil society ; and the day light
as regularly makes its appearance as if they
were governed by a king.
From the (N. T.) Minerva.
We have presented to our readers the ob
fcrvations of Paftoret, in the council of five
hundred, relative to the conduit of the di
redory towards the United States. We
have in our pofleflion an answer to those ob
servations, entitled, the " American govern
ment unveiled," which, in every refpeft,
equals the Billingsgate of the Aurora and
Porcupine's Gazette.
After some general remarks on attempts
of Segur and Paftoret, to overthrow the con
stitution, the writer fays, " At the time
when France constituted itfelf into a repub
lic, the pretended allies of Paftoret detached
themselves from us, not by a declaration of
war, which would have beceme a frank and
loyal nation, but by all those obfeure and
indelicate manoeuvres, which mart the weak
ness of a perfidious government
This is laying we ought to have gone to
war at onceâattempts to steer clear of the
war and preserve neutrality, are called per-
The writer takes for his proofs, the sub
stance of the complaints of Mr. Genet, as
they stand in his letter to Mr. Jefferfon, of
Sept. 18, 1793 â v ' z - 'he president's re
ceiving the visits of Noailles and Talon, his
fuffering medallions of Capet and his fantily
to hang in hii room, his conduct relative to
arming in our ports, prizes, Ac. and that
Wafington* had delayed to call congress
together, notwithstanding Mr. Genet's " re
fpe&ful infinuationg."
The writer speaks of Washington's being
surrounded with " men of Englandhe
speaks of the " patriciate," or senate, as
being a " conspiracy against the American
people he speaks of Mr. Monroe's being
sent " plenipotentiary" to Paris " without
powers," ds ap a& of Machiavelifm, to de
ceive the French, by his warm repuhlican
ifm, and fending Mr. Jay to London, to
make a treaty deftruftive of the French trea
ties. lie calls Mr. Jay the " Dumolard of
the United States, (that is, a tory,') Warmly
attached to monarchy, to a peerage, and to
George the III."
The writer suggests that the executive of
America has been guided by British agent*,
leagued with all traitors, refugee colonists
and emigrants, in a fhameful mannerâwith
a view to overturn the republic.
I This nonsense has been repeated in Ameri
ca, and re-echoed by the French Jacobins,
till it is perfe&ly staleâit ceases even to ex
cite Cefentment. But what the writer fays
of the designs of the French government, if
true, deserves more serious confederation.
He suggests that the French republic,
struggling against two and twenty armed
at once, has, hitherto, diflembled her deep
resentment against the IJjiited States. But
now she has cut off almost all the heads of
the menacing hydra, and finee that of Eng
land only remains to be taken off, Â« it is the
part of her grandeur, as well as of her juflice,
to manifejl to the United States all her fenfilnli
ty." Tbe direftory, he fays, have " Knio
their brows like Jupiter, but have not hurl
ed the thunderâNestor has fpeken, but
Achilles has remained ilfrhis tent."
What then must we poor devils do,
when Jupiter launches his thunder-bolts at
us, and Achilles marches forth, armed with
terror !
The following paragraph is given liter
ally :
" In a state of war so violent as that
which the French republic has sustained
against the most powerful kings of Europe,
it is indubitable that neutral nations were not
lier friends, and that her friends who covered
themselves with a fhameful neutrality, have
been and are her enemia."
This is the speaking but, what French
agents and their advocates have often hinted
to us before.
The writer then examines the question of
* So this word is spelt in this Griib-ftreet
produdlion.
v.-as with the United States. Re fays, mer- :
chants who ttade with the republic or again ft !
her, under the American Bjtfr counter revo- ;
lutioniils whs have placed their money in the
banks of the United Stages, &c. raise an
outcry about the dagger of war with the
United States. Having withdrawn their
capitals from France, and placed them in
America, they .feara rupture âwhich might
expose them to a fcqueftmtion of their pro
perty. The fame cry, he fays, Was raised
by those who had money 1 in the bank of
Venifcvc, in Geneva, and in the caverns of
Switzerland. He hints very plainly that
the French government ought not to fuffer
such friends to escape, when it is driven to
every expedient to raise money. j.
He goes on to examine the means of at- :
tack and defenfe, possessed by the United
States. We have not time at present to
notice his nbfervatious oiv these points and
some othersâbut he has one remark, that
we shall give entire. It is this :â" that
when the present powers make peace, t!fcn
is the time to chastise governments which
are weak, crafty and faithlefs."
The meaning of this, we leave to the rea
der's conjecltires.
From the NEW-YORK GAZETTE, &c.
Our Jacobin Prints appear to be inflrong
convulfions,from a fear that the Legislative
Body of the government of Prance with the
great body of the people on their fide, should get
the better of the DireÃory and th: Army, in their
frefentjlruggle forfuperiority. No man need

persons and property of the whole French Na- I
tion be at the mercy of a horde of merciless fel- \

of France the unwilling tnjlruments â¢in their *

ate each other on the return if Peace with all
its attendant blefpngs. \
The fate of America with refpeÃ to Peace or
IVar, evidently depends on the iffite of the dif
pHte between the Executive and LegiHative
branches of the government of France, the for
mer of which, that they may perpetuate their
power, are furious advocates for genera! war,
rapine and plunderâand the latter, loving ju-
Jlicc, are friend of peace, virtue, and humanity.
Test my fellow Citizens, we have monflers
among us, (I mean our jacobins, Antifedera
lijls, Anarchifls) âwho, with patricidal,diabo
lical feelings, would wijh to fee the DireÃory
triumph over the two Councils of France, in
hopes that French piracy and robbery may con
tinue againjl their defencelefs countrymen.
What Patriotic American, whether born or
adopted , but mujl bluth with indignation on
'reading the following words talen from the
Aurora, and reprinted here in a paper called
the ' time-piece â¢
"Our Fedcralifls have halloo'd before they
" were tut of the wood. A change of fllini/fcrs
" in France they expeÃed would do every thing
" for them ; but to. use another coarse adage,
" they willfind that it is ' out of the frying
pan into the Jire."
That is, the wokTHT patriots hope that
the depredationt functioned by the DireÃory
againjl the United States of America, will not
only continue, but increase. Horrid Patricides !,
How much longer will you DARE TO
BRAVE PUBLIC VENGEANCE.
ARISING FROM PUBLIC MISERI ?
I hope the indignant eyt of pure undef.led patri

deserved contempt and infamy ; and let all those
who caress, or even foffer you to fpeai to them

and they will eat straw with the oxen till
their heads is wet with the drops of the

seven years pass over their heads, they will
all acknowledge that God ought to be hon

down and build up at hie pleasure, and they
will return and bow to the very foals of
their feet, the rupublican elders, and as they
sow they will not reap, for the grain will
rot binder the clods of the valley, the daugh
ters of Belial their wombs will be all barren,
and their pÂ«ps will never give fuck, to raise
"a rebellious race, they will go from door to
door to beg their bread, they will end their
days in pain, shame, and disgrace, and when
they dre they will fall in the gulph where
the rich glutton and all the apostatized race
is gone before, to be their companions where
there is no eye to pity nor hand tp save,
whilst the republican church and people
shine with brilliant light, like the Jafperand
Sardine stone over the earth, they will all
love God and one another ; this Chronicle is
to go on fv/ift beasts, their hoofs to be like

Hi/ltry of a lig Mill,' and of a Miller that
would not grind without water.
Once upon a time a good natured fort
of a man, in passing through a diftrid of
â¢the country, observed fever.l dreams of
water, which though individually small,
were nevertheless briflc and lively. But,
in the whole diftriet, he could not hear of
a single mill for the conveniency of the in
habitants in manufacturing their grain. He
pitied the poor fouls when he saw them
every day pounding their corn, and break- !
ing it with much labor in a mortar, whereby
they majie put to procure a sorry fort of
bread, hardly fit for a dog to eat. He
determined therefore, in his own mind, to
build a mill for their accommodation. j
With much labor, expense and difficulty,
he effefted a junftion of a conf'derable j
number of these small streams, that by i
flowing unitedly into his pond, should raise
a fufficient head of water"to carry on busi
ness. He next ercfted his mill-dam, and
when the whole was completed, advertised
that he was ready to grind for the neigh
bourhqod. Now the mill soon went mer
rily round, and every one saw the advan
tage of carrying his grift theie. To en
-1 courage them, the man of the mill took
but very small toll, so in faft as hardly to
lupport"* the expenses of the manufa&ure.
After some time grinding, he began _ to
perceive that the mill took more water to
niaks her go round than came into the pond
! from the several sluices ; however, he went j
1 pn with his work till the pond was become j
! so low that the mill-wheel fairly flopped of j
I itfelf, and thte whole internal machinery at I
tlj*Â« fame time became motionless. He I
â therefore (hut down the gate to let the wa- i
ter rife again and fill the pond. Now be- !
gan grumbling. The neighbourhood were
vexed with the man and his mill for its (top
ping, and accused him of being an unfteadv
fort of a devilish fellow, inasmuch as he did
not keep the mill steadily going round,
without fnterruption. Gentlemen, said he,
make the streams that come in equal to the
stream that goes out, and the mill (hall
grind without ceasing, I'll warrant you.
If you cannot or will not do that, yon
must e'en wait till the water rises again !

COMMUNICATION.
On Friday the 15th inft. was held an ex

the trustees and several gentlemen of litera
ture attendedâthe students of the Latin and

and their tutor Mr. Findley, in the profici

BERMUDA, Augult 12.
Capt. Drake, of the fch'r Thetis, which
arrived this week from Jamaica, informs us
that on his departure from Jamaica, a ship
arrived from England, after a short passage,
which brought accounts of his .majesty's fri
gate Popione, Sir John Borlafe Warren,
commander, having been rose upon by the
crew; that they confined all the officers be
low, and fleered their course for Brest, but
as flie got near the harbour's mouthj she
was cut oft by two English frigates, retaken
and sent immediately for England.
We are also informed, from the fame
quarter, that one of his majesty's armed
fch'rs was run away with by the crew, late
ly, and carried over to the French into the
Bite of Leogane. That on her arrival there
the French put the crew into prison, and
sent word to the British commander at P.
au Prince to fend for them, as they should
all be given up, but that the vessel would
be retained. The above disappointments will
no doubt have a good effedt navy, and
convince the seamen of the bad effects of
their treachery.
Thursday was launched from Mr. Nathan
iel Tynes'Yard, his majesty's sloop of war
the Driver. She is a vefi'el built on a faft
failing plan, and bids fair to assist in scour
ing the American coast of French privateers.
.She is to join Adm. Vandeput's squadron,
as soon as fitted, and will carry 16 twenty
four pounders, carronades.

Tucfday arrived hi 3 majesty's sloop of war

PARIS, June iS.
It is generally fuppofedthat the overtures
of peace with Great-Britain will procure to
Sir Sydney Smith, if -not his liberty, at
Ifall fotae alleviation of ..his hard captivity.
He continues in close Confinement in the
fame tower which was occupied by Lous
XVI.
In the cotirfe of the lad audience which
the Po'rtugufe ambaiTador had of Charle#
Lacroix,,the latter gave a proof of igno
rance, rather uncommon even at this time.
After having threatened the ambaflador
with a declaration of war, and with fending
an army again ft Portugal, and finding that
these threats made but a very flight impres
sion on hrtri. he at last said in the utmost
I ra geâ" We _ will fend our fleets againlt
I you."â" What fleet ?" replied the ambafla
. dor. " That of Talilon"â" Tor what
. purpose To block up nU your ports on
the Mediterranean." The ambassador, hav
ing (hrewdly observed, that on discussing
i fubje&s of this nature, it appeared to him
extremely proper to consult a map, the
I miniftcrfent for one, and found, to his ut
] mod confufion, that Portugal pofleffed no*
part whatever in the Mediterranean.
According to letters from Nimeghn, a
part of the army of the North lately arrived
in Dutch Gaelders, is now marching to the
Texel. It is reported, that a considerable
( body of troqps is to be embarked there for
the purpofe%f invading England,
j June 19.
j The Italians are now trulv deserving of
j lioerty. The clubs are organized in Italy,
: exactly as they were in France under the
i blefled reign of terror. They have .their
Jacobins, their Cordeliers, nay, their frater
nal societies. In the opinion of those gen
try, it is absolutely necessary that Italy
ftiould form a republic, grand and fpler.did,
| one and indivifible,and their tribunes resound
: daily with declamations against the crowned
I tyrants.
| With a few guillotines the happiness of
Italy would be complete ; aud we under
stand that the brotherhood have already or
dered a certain number of the ingenious ma
chines, which are so wonderfully calculated
to serve the triumph of principles.
A letter from Italy advises, that it i> un
der confideratiou to effeft a descent on Por
tugal. Gen. Augerau's division is said to
have marched to for no other pur
pose than to be embarked at Leghorn and
Genoa, and to proceed from thesce to Bar
celona.
The navigation of Lake Lugano, which
.j the Swiss have already contested both with
the and Lombardians, appears like
ly to brujg on a rupture between the Can
tons and the French Republic. ' The for
mer, terrified by the fate of Venice and Ge
noa, have already sent several deputtaions to
General Buonaparte, and have endeavoured
I to fettle matters on friendly terms; but at'
> the fame Lime they put 'themselves in the
â¢ molt refpt&able state of defence.

ON THE CLUBS.
1 [From L'Eelair of June 25. J
" In proportion as the government be
| comes weak, the audacity of faftion in
creases. The difcoÃtented are no longer
fatisned with declaiming,, some in
' gilded halls, others in their ftnoky taverns.
They nyift have clubs to combine their
hopes and their animosities, and to double
1 by these combinations their chance of fuc
-1 cess. Already four or five clubs are reck
-1 oncd in Paris. The molt Celebrated are
1 those of Clichy, of Montmorency, and of
the Palais Royal. I place them here in
> the order of their dates, for Clichy has
engendered the conftitiitiooal circle of
Montmorenci, and Montmorenci has en
gendered the clubs of the Palais Royal.
" The firft, less dangerous in itfelf, is
composed only of deputies, for ttye moll
pan distinguished for their love of liberty,
and their hatred to every species of tyranny.
But if the past is a fuffieient pledge for the
pacific intentions of these deputies, I will
not the less venture to affirm that their club
may in time become fatal to their country.
The members of the constituent assembly,
Glezen and his colleague Lanjuinas, whose
1 virtues are not disputed, were in 1789 the
founders of the club' Breton, which after
' wards became so fatal to France under the
I title of the Jac'obiit club. Heaven gtant
that Clichy may not one day experience a
metamorphosis no less terrible ! But mean
â¢ while its exiftcnce is still an (evil, since it i*
" to it, that Ave are indebted for the formation
of the club of Montmorenci. O ! depu
- 'ties, do not repose upon the purity of your
â¢ intentions ! Let the past open your eyes to
> the future, and 111 di (Solving yourselves, fur
r nifti an additional proof of your, wisdom
and moderation ! The two other alTemblics
are more alarming to public tranquillity.
r In both there are lome men truly deserving
1 of esteem, refpe&able citizens, but they
â  are not unmixed. I will affirm even that
> they are not a majority.
' 'â¢ Sunt bora mixta malis fcdfunt malÂ» plura."
t " At Montmorenci are a greÂ« number
1 of conventionalifla, excluded by lot, who
f still ligh for the power they have loft, and
r j who would not be grieved to recover it by
i expelling, under the favour of some great
t ' convulsion, the fucceflors whom the will
|of the people has appointed. It contains
1 likevvife lome men too long celebrated by
$ our misfortunes, and by their OWII crimes.
- j There they listen with a kind of religion*
I ufps6 to that myfUritfus pcrioÃUgej who,rfent to fperk in the tribune, never itr/us
to make hid appearance in it, and who, like H
the ancient Sybils, will issue h's orr.clct only
frorfi Subterraneous caverns far from the
view of prophage morÃils. But it is said,
what a glorious fjciirity has the nation, in
the patriotism and integrity of some young
people, against the projects of these men,
eipecinlly the individual to whom we have
alluded ! TbonghtleSs men : recalled the
fate of the Girondists, whom you regret.
RtcollcA that behind them Dar.ton, Ro-
Kfpierre, and tAie commune lurked ; recol-
Lft tlie toe fin of-the 16th of August at
> once founded their death; and that of Louis
XVI.
" The club of the Palais Royal is com
posed of those young bucks, the ancient !
, loungers in the' Cafe de Chartres, and who
did Such good service after the 9th Thermi
dor, in (hutting the den of the Jacobins,
andin hunting them down on the memora
ble days-os Germinal and Prairial. Hatred
of the Jacobins is their prevailing sentiment,
and so far perfectly well; but a great num
ber of them profefs an equal hatred for our
constitutional inftitiitions, and here at once
begins their injustice and the danger of their
Â£ub."
In the fitting of the 24th inft. Vofe made
3 report on the petitions of Lonifa Maria
Adelaide Penthievre, the widow of the
duke of Orleans ; and of Louis Francois
Joseph Bourbon Conti. After enumerating
all the laws relative to the Bouibon family,
he spoke of the wretched situation of the
two petitioners, and of their fubmiflion to
the laws of the republic during the revolu
tion ; and concluded by moving, " that
the sequestration should be taken ofÂ£ from
their effeÂ£Vs ; that the free dispositions of
them and the rights of citizenship should
be granted to the petitioners." This mo
tion was alnnoft unanimoully adopted.

NEW-YORK, Sept. 28
Yesterday the Chevalier D'Yrujo return
ed to this city from his tour to the East

We are happy to learn that the Chevalier
W23 received with the utmost refpeft, and
treated with every politeness and hospitality
by all ranks ofpeople at Bofton,Portfmouth,
and at every town he visited. \_Argus.~\
A correspondent, who has just returned
from the country, was surprised to hear the
cliSmal ftorieÃ told and generally believed of
the dreadful ravages made by the Yellow Fe
ver in the city of New-York. He finds with
extreme pleafur'e that the city, owing to the
ftri&nefs of the police in keeping the streets
and yards clean, was never more healthy than
it is at present. It is sincerely to be wished,
that every person going into the country will
feclhimfelf under a sacred and ittflifpenfahle
obligation to invalidate the belief of the
country people with refpeft even to the ex
iltence of the Yellow Fever at all in this ci
ty ; in order to remove so powerful an objec
tion to their coning to towr; with' their pro
duce, ajid to thtir Supplying thcmfelves with
the itfual articles Mt this fi.ifos of the year.
âGod knows bufnefsi of! every kind feels
| Sufficiently the deporable effects of real evils,
from the depredation of our dear allies, with
out cruelly inventing imaginary ones to fill
lip the measure of public mifcry.
A number of able writers appear, in
.the southern papers, to be advocating the
catife of our government. One of these un
der the signature of Americanus, who appears
in a Richmond paper, has very ably develo
ped the causes of the differences between
United States and France. He has entered
; fully into an examination of Mr. Jefferfon's
I conduft" which he considers as extremely
j injurous to our public interests. He ascribes
! the hostile affV'ft of the French government
towards tha United States, wholly to the in
fluence of a party, of which Mr. Tefferfon
is a leaderâin this idea he is unquestionably
well founded. The arguments of the French
government, in support of their measures,
are evidently borrowed from the oppofers of
ovir government in AmericaâOur own citi
zens, who assume the exclusive Â»t erit of be
ing 'Â« patriots" and republicans" have fup
pliedthe French with the weapons by which
our government lYaffailed, our trade annoy
ed, and our country menaced with war.
The bold efforts of our citizens in the
southern states, to enlighten their country
men on their political interests, among which
we notice the writings ,of Americanus and
of Mr. Harper, as prominent instances, will
be followed by very salutary effeÂ£ts. Thefs
efforts ought to have been made earlier, as
they were in the northern states. But late
as they are,' they will be ufeful in preparing
the public mind, either for peace or war.â
The two points to be aimed at in all our
political disquisitions, are, to promote Union
and a sentiment of Americanifm âa sentiment
that fpringa up in the heart a *'] is cherished
and matured by the underflandingâa senti
ment that loves public justice, and invites
the refpeft of all nationsâhut disdains to re
ceive fetters from any; whether presented
by armed foldicrs, under royal authority;
or by fawning hypocritical vepublicans, un

FROM INDIA.
Extraft of a letter, dated Trapquehar, (Co
romandel coast,) April 31, 1797, receiv
ed here.
" The famous Modefte privateer is at last :
taken : the faft failing frignte Fox, caught â 
her, after a chafe of eight hours, when the
Modefte carried away her sore-top-mast, else
(he would have escaped. She had before
made a fuccefsful cruize against the English,
ifnd sent several of their valuable country (hips
to the Isle of France. Tt is reckoned that
this privateer alone has captured property j
from the English in their seas to the value
of above a million of dollars, and near as
much more from the Dutch, Portuguese
and Spaniards, at the firft of the war. But
all English India speaks much in praise of;
the conduft of the captain and officers
of the Privateer Modefte ; as upon all
/oecafions they restored private property,
trunks, clothes, &c. and set all her prison
ers ashore on their own coast. Their unex
ampled conduft to the ladies and gentlemen
of the Triton English Tndiamen, last year,
stands high in the lift of noble a&ions.

S!R,
IN the latter part of the mnftth of July
I was in the Upper and Lower Sandufky,
where I saw the' following prisoners, viz.
In Lower Sandufky I saw a boy, about 16
years of age, of the name of Hampton North
np. He was taken out of the cornfields
above the mouth of Big Kenhaway, upon
the Ohio, and is now with the Wyndot na
tion :âThe family he lives withf of thÂ»
Hedge-Hog tribe, was about to move to a
Wyndot town, five miles above the Upper
Sandufky, where the said boy may be had
at any time. He can talk but little Eng
lish, and it was with much difficulty I got to
know his name and where he was taken.â
Should this boy have any friends, it is my
advice to them to go after him as soon as
poflible, for should he' flay there a few years
it will be impoflible to prevail on him to
leave the Indians.
At Upper Sandufky I saw a young man
of the name of Armflrong, who told me he
had been taken from near Pittsburgh, and,
as well as I can recolleft, he tol4 me he had
been with the Indians five years ; he speaks
very gftod English. "After considerable con
siderable conversation with him, I told him
I would try to find out his people and let
them know he was alive ; at this he appeared
1 not to be well pleased ; I asked him feverul
questions afterwards, but he would talk no"-
" thing but Indian ; when I came away, I ask
â¢ ed him if he had any word to fend to his
people ; he answered no, in a very surly man
ner.
It grieved me to fee him so much of a
savage ; he is a handsome young man and
, of a beautiful countenance, about 5 feet 8
inches high, and remarkably aftive.

Such as we have Â»dual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. 11 and u, Otfego patent,

this a place in their papers, as well to cnution the

inclination, which was made out on the rcth day
of November, 1793, or set back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; u>fd further the name ot
