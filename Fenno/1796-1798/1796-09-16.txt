â A very valuable Merchant Mill> p ,
â J A DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and sundry STONE ~
Â£V QJJARIUES to be let.
I will rent my merchant Mill at the little Falls of Po
tow mac, for any term rot less thanfeven, nor more than
' eleven years, from the firft day of September next. The
tron K mill-house Is 4Z by 40 feet, three stories high, built with ! -
stone, and hasin it three pairs of French Burr Stones, two j
). overshot l 8 feet water-wheels, and Evans's machinery 1 ol
f complete, with every other thing proper and necessary for ar
âââ¢ carryingon thebulinefs with dispatch, and-at as little ex- p<
penfe as possible, all 111 good order.âFrom the mill to my al
u Iâ  â ! tii-g â -Â» .tV>a P-*-,â -- ( >f any bur- |k<
large then may deliver grain and tike in flour) it is about 40 i
mges, yards, and from thence by water to George-Town and "
Â° the City of Walhingtos, about 3 miles, and to Alexan-
dria about It miles. This situation, aided by a fufficient
capital, will command the produce of a very extensive
back country, where large quantities of wheat,and other
grain is annually made, the diSance to it being from 8
to to miles less than to any raaiket town up in the navi
gation of the Potowmac. There are on the preniifes a
large-ftotie Coopers' fh .ip, a stone granary, and a commo
dious miller's house. At the -landing aforefaid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, which is in great for-
and probably will be finifhed the ensuing fall.
There are also on the premises, a Brtwery and Distille
ry, built with stone, in them are three stills, two coppers
or boilers, with every necessary article, all new, and in
good order, and fufficiently large to carry on the Brew
s try and DiftiHery upon a very extensive plan. This prop
erty I will rent for the fame term of years.
Upon my lands adjoining the premises, and along the '
y â  banks of the river, where craft may lead with eafeand dis
patch, is an i nmehfe q-iantity of building and founda- j
iffetas tion-ftones. Four quarries are now open, and as many
â  as by -more may be opened with cafe : the stone taken from these j
d will 'piarries* is better, and has, the preference at this market, c
to any other stone brOHght to it. I will rent these quarries (
le day fcparately or together as may best suit. ' _ c
On the top of the hill, and about too yards from the 1 (
ccr . mill, is a stone Dwelling-house, large enough for the nc- 1
j' comniorktion of a family : also, a kitchen, dairy, smoke- 1
house, &c. and a garden, enc ofed and in cultivation, the
foiof which is equal in goodness to any in this slate. I

lEWS Adjoining to the Brewery and Diflillery is a Smith's
ho a r e (hop, in which is a complete set of Blackf.nith's tools,
fc jic which 1 will also rent, and if agreeable I will hire to the
tenant two negro blacksmiths, one of them is a complete
workman.
et . 1 I rent out the stone quarries, I will fell three crafts,
lif which were built for the purpose of .carrying stone : they
will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch Immediate!
possession will be given. For terms apply to the Mifcrib

For it* Gazette of the Jniteb Statss.
Mr. Fenno,
Notwithftandinp thr malevolence of Peter Poi"
cupine againll the ftiends 3i:d clfarnpions of Liber"
â ty, I have always been inclined to think weil of his
principle* ; imagining that liis bittcrntfs proceeded
from his education, and that all his farÂ«afmÂ», how
ever severe, were the feelings of his heart.
I have, howt*ver, like many others, been difsp
pointed. In a pamphlet, published. by Mr. Brad
ford, the public are presented wj:h aletter written
by Peter Porcitpine again ft himfelf, which he sent
to Mr. Bache to be published, as coming from the
democrats. Such baseness and deceit, I think, can
result only from a disposition long hardened in
gtiilf; & that the writer should podefs so mu#h ma
3t. lignity as to submit even to forgery for the purpose
of annoying his enemies, is what I never could
have believed.
How can Peter expect, after such an inllance
of meanness and falfehood, that any of hi's aiTer
tions will be credited ? or how Avill he convince tis,
" j that bis scarecrow letter is not also a forgery, and
even all the letter! that have been written against
lie him ?
i recollect reading an address in one of our pa- :
pers some time ago, to the citizeirs,of this place,
urging them to check the writings of this
author, and alledging, at the fame time, that such
Â«lÂ»ufe would be pardonable *in a native American ;
but that no such liberty ought to be granted to a
3, foreigner.. Such a sentiment excited my contempt
â c at the time; and I have,fince feeu it commented
i6 ' upon, in one of Peter's pamphlets. . ,
' The idea of confining the freedom of the press
to the natives of this country, is too grossly absurd
ever to have been the real wish of asy.perfon ; and
I am now firmly persuaded, that the fame wascoun
terfeited by Peter, and intonded by him as a han
e die to his'enemies, upon which he might ground
some cehfures at a future day.
Let any person consider, whether frich a senti
ment, at once so base and so ridiculous, could be
E the cool opinion of any man amongst us ; and if
his judgment acquits tbefe, whether we mjy not
justly charge it upon him, who has since shewn
himfelf capable of similar mifconduÂ£l.
VERITAS.
EXTRACT 1
>' From Colonne's political Jlate of Europe, at the
commencement of 1796.
" " When, in the month of November lad, I be
gan to writea few articles that were fucceflively in.
ferted in the Courier de Londrea, under the title of
Tableau de I'Europe, I was very far from forming
the deiign of composing a regular work. I only
wished to aflill the editor of that paper, who has
every just claim to my moll tender interell*. Soon,
however, the variety and importance of the lub
t. j e( -^ s tthich fell under my conlideration, the differ
ent questions tS>-at arose from the circumflances of
the moment, and the deep attention which, fram
the impression they-made on my mind.'l was indu
ced to bellow upon them, carried me much beyond
my oiiginu! intentions. The horizon widened by
degrees and 33 I wished to be wholly direfleii by j
the course of the different events, which then follow
ed each other, with so varied and rapid a fucccffion, |
it became impofiible to adopt a regular plan, and I 1
was obliged io give way to digreflions, which de- (
manded more or less illuflration, according to the ]
importance of the occurrences of the day, and the ,
peculiar inteieft of the moment. ,
â  I have had two principal objects in view :
< the one relating to that part of the French, as well
within as without the kingdom, that is well inten
tioned ; the other relating so all the powers of Eu-
rope, but.especially Englartd. '
First object. lam firmly convinced that the re
eftablilhment of order in France, which is no lon- ;
- ger to be eXpeÂ£ted from the mere force of arms, !
I can only l>e effe&ed by a general impulse and una-
I iiimous resolution of the whole nation.
I am convinced that the nation, exasperated by
the numerous and accumulated evils which it expe-
riences, is very well disposed to receive this im- c
pulse. f
I am convinced, that what chiefly obftrufls this c
favourable disposition, proceeds from this circum. '
, fiance, that the nation being in general defirousof
a change, does not precisely know what kind of a
change it would be for its interest to adopt, and has
no fixed rallying point to which it can direst its t
jviews. " â  f
lam convinced, that in order lo give every de- i
gree of dtcilion andailivity to this disposition of 1
the people, it becomes indispensable, that every par- f
ty, every power, that is an enemy to the present 4
government of demagogues, which opprefies France 1
under the fpecieus r.ame of a republic, should unite
in one desire, be animated by one spirit, and concur
in one plan ; and that they should unanimously
agree In printing to the eyes of the natiop one 1
fjsigle objefL that might command the general ap
probation, and gain an univeifal eoitcurrence. [
I am convinced, that this object should not be
to compel the p.opie to resume what'they have re- f
jetted with so much violence, what they evince '
such an unconquerable repugnance tove-adopt, what '
in short, 11 incompatible witb their present' prepof- f
, lemon 5 for, inltead of attempting the frenzy ci 1
their mind, mftead ef reclaiming their wild and be
wddered imaginations, it would be a measure the
nioft repulsive to their feelings, and would only re
plunge them into their former errors, to announce
, tot * zm > hat thty tan find no other issue out of re
publican anarchy, but by reentering into that fitu
[ *' My brother U among the number or emicrants

eaufe of a!! their evils, and from which tiiey forced
thcmfelvesby the molt terrible convulsion. It will
not conciliate tlieir mwds to f a y them, re aritnite
what you have so completely deprived of all exist
â  ence : re-e(tabii(li what you view wih'fueh dread
" and horror, and expect nothing of what you lo av
? dently deiire.
I am eonvlnced, on the contrary, that in orcer
to induce the people to adopt a good government,
it is necessary to present oncwhich has at least the
appearance of being enentii.liy new, and totally dif
ferent from that which they hare slellroved ; that
? it is necessary 'o acknowledge the deleft* â¢>( the au
-1 cient in order to fecui.e the favourable
" reception of that in which these impetfeflions
1 (hould not exist ; and that, in the present moment,
' the only certain m?ans of turning the iide of popu.
lar prejudices in favour of monarchy* would be to
j declare, in a solemn manner, and to ddnfcre to the
declaration, that monarchy {hould be created on a
constitutional basis, regulated !)nd tempered by laws
that should have a fufficient Safeguard to render
them fixed and immovable.
j Lastly, lam convinced, that it is nat only pos
t fible to form such a tnonurchy, to appropiate it to
the French character, and to adapt it to the fafcty
aftd pr'ofperity of the kingdom ; but also that,
from the point where we now are, it is a much
j (horter way to arrive at that reformation, than it
( would be to return to the ancient order of things.
. Besides, there is now no choice left; one Avay lies
i open and accelfiblej whilst' the other is obftruÂ£ted
by insuperable difficulties, and by obftaclcs that are
| now bccorne infutmountable.
, Second objeit. To appreciate, with justice and
1 impartiality, whatever I have permitted myfelf to
observe. in the course of this work on* the coriduft
of the coalesced jiowers, on the political ftatc of j
Europe, at the present moment, and on the proper
rneaffs to obtain a speedy and solid pacification, it ,
becomes necessary to rÂ«cal to mind what was the o- !
rigin of this war, with what 'fpii it tfcie powers de
clared they entered into it/ and what (till (hould be â 
the real object of >i 7 relative Ws lire ul tunrtrt - -
of all civil society. ,
It is inconteftible that the French were the ag- ,
greffors : tin h - real motive was, that the revolu
tionary chiefs were in need of a war, to keep the |
nation employed, and stood in need of armies, the i
better to enslave the people j but their ostensible
motive, expressed in their declaration, was to de
fend their liberty, and their new conftitutitfn, a
gainst the supposed intention of the sovereigns to
deprive them of both.
On the other hand, the powers considered that
the French revolution!lts, a6ting on a fyltem found- '
ed on anti-social do&rmes, had become the enemies
of all nations, and of all public tranquillity.âFor
this reason, a: the very time they armed tc repel '
their attacks, they formed a confederacy, with a
view to deflroy the foctis of a .contagion which
threatened every empire ; and they announced it to
be their principal object, " ,to consolidate in France '
the baiis of a monarchical government, equally '
suitable to the/rights of sovereigns, and to the '
welfare of the French nation."
Thx'e were the terms of the declaration fig Bed '
at Pi'nitz, Augult 27, 1791, between the Em
peror and the King of Prussia.
That which was publifned in the name of the
fovereignÃ, by the duke of Brunfwick, as gene
ralifiimo of their armies, at the opening of the
campaign of 1792, equally expresses that " their
Majesties bad no other objedt in view but the hap
piness of France, without pretending to enrich
themselves at her expence, by conquests."
" It is the full assurance of these intentions,"
said the Bourbon .princts at that time, " which
justifies us in urtiting our (landards with those of
the foreign powers. By publishing their inven
tions, they have legitimated their proceedings
and our Wiftes for their firccefs, are conformable
with those which we have aever ceased to exprtfs
for the good of our country."
When, afterwards, England joined the con
federation, (he manifefted (till more plainly, the
fame fentlments. His Britannic Majelty, in his
declaration, dated Odtober 29, 1793, far from
(hew iug a desire of taking any advantage of the dis
orders of France, exhnrtÂ»d Â»)1 FÂ»nwefamÂ»n foully
immediately round "the monarchical government,
referring it for another opportunity to discuss tlie
necessary modifications.
" He invited themto.unite under the empire of
the law, of morality and religion, in order to in
sure a petmanent peace v.sh tlieir neighbors, the :
internal tianqujllity of the country, a just and true i
lilierty, a wife, modeiate and beneficent govern- !
ment, and the enjoyment of all the advantages
which may secure the bappintfs of a great and flou-.
tifhing nation."
These v.ords, which Wisdom herfelf seems to
have uttered, by the mouth of George 111. are
the text of the whole political part of my woik.
My continual efforts are to demonstrate that now,
more than ever ; every plan and cvery-ftep (hould
be directed toward* the eltabli(hment of that " wife,
moderate and beneficent government, which alone
can insure a iuft and true liberty, can re-tftablifh
the empire of the law, of religion, and morality,
and reltore peace to Fiance as well as to her neigh
bors."
" By infilling on the execution of such noble
resolutions, I ouiy refer to intentions announced
by all the powers ; and by combating every depar
ture from thi6 line of conduÂ£t, 1 only continue to '
pay homage to those fame iatcntions too \*brtl;y of
the allies not to be durable. If I express in this
writing an unwillingness to believe, that the cabi
net of London has abandoned tkem, and that what
ever appearances may be, it is actually determined
to acknowledge tne chimerical and momentary gp
vetnment which now exifls in France ; I reft folelys
9 n the very ptinciples of his Biitannic majesty, i.i
culcatcd in that declaration ; and no subsequent cir-
iÂ»ave 'oeen an inducement to ~ban. |
den themi.finee there esifts :he fame indifpeniable '
, necessity for all Europe to dc!hcy that which wi',l j

I'.ech you to afe your interest to get me extricated, th
Sv petitioning the ConfuJ, or some other means, in

I\wuand malter, went on board the Monitor, and 0 i
tupplied Capt. Honeywell, with every neceflary he f,
was in want of. The other American captains did tl

BOSTON, September 10. tl
. We (lop the press, to notice the arrival here, this V i
morning, of Capt. Swaine, 56 days from Bremen. n
Â£ He brought no papers :âHowever, by the polite- r<
nets of the Cspt. we arc enabled to date the follow- n
ing interelhng particulars :âThat on the T 2th
July, about a day's march from Franktort, a severe r |
engagement took place between the French and ri
Aultrian armies, which ended in the tot'al defeat of 5
the latter, the loss of 12,0c0 killed and taken pii- p
foners, together with their baggage, artillery, &c. d
That the French immediately pulhedon for Frank- I
fort, and it was supposed' at Bremen, when Capt. ]:
i Swaine failed (July 15) that the French Were al- n
! ready in poflejilion of that plaee. This intelligence y
arrived by express from the Autlrian army, and was t
confnmed by the Andrign soldiers who had efca. j (
ped. It appears, that the French effedted this de-
teat by ilrÂ«iagem ; -icgimcnt of - a
their uoopsin Audrian uniform the evening prcce- f,
ding the battle, they were made to feign an attack v
on the French ; who retreatedâthe Auftrians ob
serving the French falling back, cume on wich all I
their forces ; and when the French decoyed t
them far enough to efFetl the/r purpose, they tarn- t
fed 011 them, and made a mod complete victory. t

I threatened to make itfeif mader of Rome by Flo

it would be unjtift for us to violate a territory which
th? coalefccd powers had refpecled. After some con- ne

â  As the fate of Wefton, the great Speculator and
; Swindler, has been mentioned in some late pa
-3 pers, we (hall give our readers the following a
necdotes of this remarkable man from the Lour
don Pyblic Ledger.
, WESTON.
t The following fa&smay serve as inftanees of the
llrength of crcdit of this departed youth. Want
: ing 4 or SCOOI. he applied to a gentleman of the
s bank, faying, He had occasion for that sum for
. a few days, and that as he would place ia
: hi 6 hands, Scrip to the amount of 3Â® or 40,000 on
s which some payments haÂ« iieen made. It was a
-1 greed upon, andTVefton lodged for the loan, a por'
eel of blank paper sealed cisfcrip ! Enabled by lomc
. other fuccelslul manoeuvres, he mide the re-pay
(. ment, and received back his fupptfed valuable de
-3 posit.
e 'At another time de firous of n similar sum, he in
;) formed his patron (Mr; Cowan) that a fine oppor
tunity offeicd of nv.king a considerable per-centage,.
K Mr. Cowan listened, but aufwered it vtl% incor.-
e venieut to spare mote ihan 4or joocl. immediate
e ly. Wefton* ever prepared, tcld himne had already
u made application, and, that the house of Hoare
j would accommodate him wmUÂ« any sum he might
want,on lodging the feenrity of government j he.
, s accordingly acceded to Welton's propofala, and
._ furoilhed him with the required sum. Wefton, pre
s tending he had lodged the script purchased there
with, brought to Mr. Cowan a seemingly legal in
strument properly executed by Mr. Hoare, and
attested by himfelf, agreeing to return tha scrip or
loan, on repayment of the advances made thereon,
with interest.
a! Mt. Cowan, well pleased, carefully loclted up in
a, his iron theft the agreement of Mr. Hoare, not haÂ«
s, ving the smallest doubrt of its authenticity. Strange
s- to tell 1 no fitch agreement ever existedâno fuck
ie scrip Was ever purchased. Wefton fabricated the
le whole to obtain 4006!. trom Mr. Cowan, but in
ifl jullice it must be added, that he replaced the money
if- to Mr. Cowan, and the agreement being thus reÂ»i
ig dered a nullity, no enquiry ever ensued.
cr By ways ac.d means such as the above, he war
enabled to jobb to an amazing extent. His deal
ings in three years cannot have fallen short of one
million sterling ; his 'ciTcs in lottery insurance, at
if- Pharo, in the Alley, and Ha.zard, having amoun-"
eA ted, by his own confeffion, since conviftiun, to up- Â»
en wards of 53,000! I '
Confidence was the mod wonderful trait in hit
character, and though it helped him through many
hait-breadth escapes, yet how a young mind, agita
ted as his muli. have been, could attempt to facc
>y. those he so injured and so duped, is truly aftonifhr'
so. ing. The reader must have observed, that his re
quisition was generally for 4 or 50001.
t To obtain fueh a sum, he once applied to Job
ber for Sciip to a considerable amount, offering for
r payment the acceptance of Sir H. P. Walter s.
they were taken and the scrip delivered. A fewr
days before, the drafts became due, he applied again
to the broker, begging au exchange of Sir H. P.-
Walters drafts for the fame amount, at a few days
lon date, dtawn by him on Mr. Cowan's banker ; thi*
oix â  also was dhne, and though Mr. Cowan was ignorant,
nas of the tranfa&ion, he had the resolution to invites
me the broker and his family to a meeting Â»f convivia
ice lity with Mr. Cowan and hisfamily at his chamber*
âand, notwithflanding the probability and danger
of an explanation between the parties, which must
have destroyed him, he left them together for a con*
ln liderable time. Nothing transpired at this meeting.
om But the loan has been, and {till is, a mbjedt of
na " litigation ; tlie Scrip was fold, and the produce dif
'"l" iipated by Wefton; and it remains for the Bench.
to determine, who is to fuffer the loss, Mr. Cowam
on " or the Broker.

fold off.âThe money prizes will payable in thirty days I
after it is finifhad ; and any prizes for which fortunate I
cambers ate not produced within twelve months after the
drawing is closed, are to be considered as given towards
the funi for the University ; it being determined to fettle
the whole business in a year from the eidihg of the draw
ing, and to take up the bonds given as security. J
The real securities given for the payment of the Prizes, 1
are held by the President and two Directors of the Bank
of Columbia, and are valued at more than half the a- j
mount of the lottery.
The twenty four gentlemen who by appointment of
this late Comxniffionefs a (lifted in the managemen: of the I
Hotel Lottery are requefledto undertake this arduous task
a second time on behalf of the public ; a fufficient num
,ber of these having kindly accepted, it is hoped that the
friends'to a National University and the other federal ob
jects may continue to favor the design.
By accounts received from the difierent parts of the
Continent as well as from Europe, where the tickets
have been sent for sale, the public are allured that the
drawing will speedily commcwe, and that the care and
caatior. unavoidably necessary to insure a fafe disposal of I
the tickets, has rendered the inorr fufpe.nfiou indifpenlable. 1
