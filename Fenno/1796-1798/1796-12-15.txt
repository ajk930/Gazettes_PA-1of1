TO BE SOLD,
J A LEASE fcr ftven years,from tie "15th March next, in that
capital and beautiful FARM, called
P R O S P E C T-H ILL,
j Situated within one quarter of a mile fron the Brandywine
I Mills, and half a mile from the borough of Wilmington.
âj r I dwelling house is built of stone, two stories high,
I genteely finiftied, and contains four handf>me rooms on
I a floor, befidcs an entry, with capital garrets, and convenient
Â°" I cellars. It is generally thought to command the mod a
1g I greeable profpeft ot the Delaware, from the source of that
I live! to tW Capes. This profpeft ia gieptly ernbeliilhed by
I a full view of avail body ot meadow, through which the
I Chriilia/ia and Brandywine crccks are seen winding in beau-
I tiful meanders. Near the house are a Kitchen, a spacious
I stone flable and hayloft a barn, a carriage house, mifk
-1 house, See. and a well of as pute water as any on the conti
j nent. The garden contains an acre and quarter of land, a-
I hounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, iof
I the very belt kind, brought tiora Maryland, and in tull bear-
I ing. There is, moreover, on the place, a young, apple
I orchard beginUw to bear, and leveral old trees that produce
118 1 abundantly, bcfide* cherry and other ornamental trees, in
I great numbers. The farm consists of near sixty acres of Und,
I of good quality, 'and clear of incumbiances, except taxes,
I twenty ot which erenow iu excellent clover and timothy,
ds, I and ten more will be ready lor lowing next spring. A re
the I fid;nceot nearly 8 yearj has convinced the fubferiber that
np- I the fituatien is rcmvtkably hcalihy. The great post road
it- I from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within seventy
ow I yards of the house. In a word, the beauties and conveni
d a I ence of thiifituation cannot be enumerated in an advertise-
I ment, and when examined, will probably command the at
iec I tention of any person who isdcfimus of living at onÂ« of the
ted j moll elegant country feats on the continent. The purebefer
ni! I may enter on the premiss nCstfpnnf, or perhaps, this fall,

his, Tbe petition of Mr. Hill was re-committed to 0
in, the committee of claims.
4r. The report on the petition of Thomas Lloyd, P
Â»ar and Thomas Carpenter was taken up in committee fl
da of the whole. The report contemplates, that each Â®
ind member (ball be provided with . copies of
4> the debates propoftd to be publiflied, at the choice c
the of each member. - The report was rejected, 19 mem- "
ted hers only rising m the affirmative. The report of f !
:fn, the committee of the whole agaioft the report of "
cr<> the feleft committee was agreed to, c<
ara he order of the day in committee of the whole, cl
he on the draft of an answer to the Prefid. nt's fpeecls li
lie was then taken op, Mr. MiJlilenberg in the chair. u
ed On motion of Mr. Venable, the word interior in ai
,at the fecund paragraph was (Iruckout and the word w
ge iL'eJlcrn fubitituted, so as to readâ" and to main- 01
he tain the tranquility of the -wejlern frontier."
Mr. Giles did not approve of the expressions eon- fr
tamed in the reported answer to a very important P 1
and delicate part of the Preiidtnt's address. The
he present he said 'was a very important crisis of our 9'
affairs with refpeft to France. He considered a "<
uipturchctweenthiscountry ard France as a threat- 01
ening danger, and in that view he did not altou-... vv
the. approve ot theclaufe io the report that had re- ,0

as incrcrorc oftcr an smendmeni more wiin a view of nc
expreffiug hit objedion to the report, that it micrht,
if the committee concurred with him, be recom

the trench Republic, that was the ohjea of his re<
Â»- motion, and he conceived the of it Q,t

" M , r - Smilh T - S. C. had no ohjeflion to the a- \l<
. mendment. He considered it as merely an ampli- rbi
- ncation of the fent.ment already toinained in the bee
report He believed it was the wish of every one to
to preserve peace ; and he could not objeff , 0 in r
dilating on that fubjeft in the answer, if it was the wna
wi(h of any one member. v j
Mr. Ames wiffied to know whether the motion t'Â»,
went to concluding the paragraph with the words of I
above dated, orwhether the remainder of it was to I
hand as in the report.
Mr. Giles fi'ggefted that there might be a dif- vine
tirct amendment introduced to the latter part of for
the paragraph after the present had been d fp.fed of. Inc.
Mr. -snes w.fficd the .mentions of the member dcÂ£l
with refnea to the whole paragraph might he dif. be c
âHe ' a well fitio
that members when they agreed to amplify the that
part Â°/ ,! ? e clause f1,0,,!d underlbud what r,as on v
meant to be a, teredin the latter part. By the a
mendment great reliance w*. to be placed on the crisis
French for the maintenance of harmony, and if cd t
Uft P ara g ra P h was to be ft ruck out, ens r
none would seem to be placed on ourfelvej. It curre
nÂ»ght be more patriotic, in the opinion of some If
gentlemen to pU-e this great reliance on a foreign sense
nation, and little on ourselves j but for his own the I
part this was not hi 9 opinion.
Mr. Giles said that he had no idea of propofin* 'hat .
"inyamendment to the remainder of the clause Â£ 0 f ..
two sny manner com eAed with the prefenf. He wifli.
Ed the House to exprefo in the firft instance une.
crally qutvacally their feotiroems with refpea to the pre
ifhes. (ervation of peace, and not leave their opinions oir
this important head tg be deduced hy conftruflion.
He did not wi(h this to be done by referring to
ant, what the President had exbrefled j but that the
E. House Ihould express their Swieleelings on the 6c
llow. carton.
He contemplated, he said, fdbmitting another
amendment after the present one was decided.
Though he conceived no connection between the
two, yet he would here, he said, mention it by way
ident of informationâThiÂ« amendment was to the lit
oard ter part ot the sentence. The drift of it was, by
the a trifling alteiation, to express the reliance of the
irpe, House on tha mutual justice and moderation of the
â soU two nations for a continuance of harmony, and
not a reliance on the moderation and justice of
ying France only.
fica- The question was put upon the firft amendment
lents and agreed to, nem. con. as was also the second *.
Mr. mendment.
is at Mr. Parker ohjefied to the last claafe but one
nod in the report in which Americans are msde to stile
the therrtTelvs the fretjl and mojl nation in
(hip the ruirld. He meved for striking out those words
(1 as observing, that though the fact werefo, weouoht
Hied not to be the heralds of our own praise.
sof Mr. Harper wilhed to make a motion that would
, in fupercede the last, it was to strike out of the istter
om- pa; tof the additfa, all that part which related to
the Prefideftt's services, talents, virtues, &c. and
an- to fubflitute one paragraph expressing fentitnents of

Mr. H. observed, tha: he did not make this mo
tion, bee.:life he himfelf difapprored Â»f any thinfc
the contained in the report as it flood ; but the fublti.
tute he proposed was more simple and coneife ; and
ap- in this way he conceived the fer.timems would be

Mr. Giles said he had oLjeflions to fere,,l p . ra

to e flruck out and the report recommitted, not

In the next place, if he stood alone in the opi- 4

Inceed he had opposed every measure of theirs ref
praing our foreign relations,, aad unless he could
be convinced that he had been wrong in th.t 000 l
fition, he could not be made to feel the exitercr f
that wisdom. If the measures of thlt admfnift",;.
on with to foreign powers had been wife

If the report had been f 9 framed a. to express a 1
Ik P a " Mtlfra ' virtue and uprightLfs of
rose ' t r m ' , \ t have obtained the unanimous
rose of the houle ; but .t was lo be expeaed
that many of the members should so far l o se fight
of Itlf refprtV a, to condemn by one âtc thehole cotirfe of their own political eonduÂ£. If Â«
vew was taken, indeed, of our internal fituationit
v ouid be fecrn that circumstances exist Â»ot usually
tendant ion a (late or prosperity; public and pri
vate credit is shaken, arising in a great degree from
the fif?al operations of the adminillratiow.
Another sentiment in the report he could not agree
in. He did not regret the Present's retiring from
oifice. He hoped he would retire and enjoy the happi
ness thaj awaited him in retirement. He believed it
would more conduct to that happiness that he fliould
retire than if he should remain in office. He believed
the government of the United States founded on the
broad baiis of the people; that they were competent
Co their own government, and the remaining of no mail
>n office was necessary to the success of that govern*!'
- mtnt. The people would truly be in a calamitous a
fituationof one man were essential to thÂ« exiltesce of! r
tbeir government ; he was convinced th.it the United i I
States produces a thousand citizens capable of filling
the Prel'idtntial ch.iir, and he would trust to the dif- *
eernment of the people for a proper choice. Tfco' the J
voice of all America should declare the Present's retir- '
ing as a calamity, he could not join iu the declaration, c
because he did not conceive it a misfortune. He hop- a
ed the President would be happy in his retirement, and p
he hoped he would retire.
He reverted again to that part of the report which ! j
declared the admiuiftration to have been wife and firin ' ?
in itsmeafures. He had always disapproved, he re- j Â°
peated, of the measures of that administration with res- i 17
pett to foreign relatons, and many members of the | ai
noule had also, he was therefore surprised that gentle- r
men would now come forward anri wifii him in one tr
breath to disavow all his former opinions without be- cl
ing previously convinced of having been in an error. f r
For his own part he conceived there was morecaufe T
than ever for adhering to his old opinions, thfcourfe of T"
events had pointed out their propriety, and if he was ' u
not much mistaken a crisis was at hand which would w
confirm them. He wished that while gentlemen are ui
willing to compliment the President, they would pay h<
foir.e rtlpedk to the feeling of others.
He then adverted to the lad paragraph but one.
Even if the United States were in fa<ft the most free
#nd molt enlightened nation in the world, it was no .
evidence of it, that they fliould ltoop tÂ® publishing it m
themselves. Befidesa declaration of that kind had no- ch
thingto do with the hufinefs of the house. m
, HÂ« next adverted to the sentiment exprefled in the oil
fame clause Â«that adulation would tarnish the luflre,
ice." and ob'crved that those words introduced in a v
parenthesis appeared to have forced themselves upon the ]
committee as in fail felf-coodercning what had been "
written before in exalted p.'aile of the President, co
He concluded by a few lemarku oil the last clinic of di:
the report, which exprelTed a wifli that the Present's kr
fuccefTors may keep him in view as an example wor- cri
thy of imitation. It would be time enough, he laid, to p,
fpeÂ»ik ofh s fuccefior when he should arrive. His ill?- .
ceffor he did not doubt when he did come intooffue r
would exert his bell judgment Â»Â»d abilities for the
good ofthe United States, an* would pursue the course tcl
without any example. en
The objectionable parts of the report he ol.ferved toi
were so interwoven Â«ith the reft, that he hoped his mo- rzi
tion toitnie out a:vl recommit would prevail. cr ;

the other fourteen electors, when he was anfweted, f '
that they bad already chosen a president, that the pj e

From the specimen they have given of their Ikill, tcr j
I liope not one of those gentlemen who were pre- rec ]
sent at forming the V/helen ticket, will ever pre- (j an
tend to, or be present at, the forming any ticket
in future, for the federal interefl in this state,
I hope any gentleman, hereafter, named as an s on
elector to support a particular intireft, if he is not j-.1 c
in that intercft, will deelore it publicly, and in j ay
time, that he may be understood, and that the peo-
pie may i . Se deceived. When I vote for a legif. r
litor, 1 i*.ird the privilege that he is to cxercife ~
iris own judgmentâlt would be abfutd to prescribe Q f ;
the delegation. But when I voted for the Whelen
ticket, I voted for John Adams; and if Israel had Â«
got in, I think he would have had sense enough to t,- .
know it, and candour to adt accordingly. What! ]
do I chufe Samuel Miles to determine for me whe- c|r .
*seer John Adams or Thomas Jefferfon is the fitteft
man for President of the United States? No I i
chufe him to ad, not to think. Did the enlighten.
ei counties of Wafhirigton, NorthumberlarJ and fl j ( y
Philadelphia exert every nerve, and cheat into the f t
bargain, fr.r men that would hesitate between the Bot
two candi-iatcs ? Certainly no!. When two tickets â < jj
:Te formed, does half of the (late take up fifteen ] em|
men to uftirp the privilege of thinking for them t |, e
upon jonc plain queltion ? No thenc u more sense in ,
thccoontry than'that. Did the glorious county of ces
York, that federal gem, turn out its honed inhabi
tanls, and give Mr. Miles three thousand votas, for 7iy ,
'He purpose of furthering Mr. Jefferfon's eleflion I coni
No, no, no. j j (
Now the affair as to tss is over, and not much to al] j
my mind, yet T honour the thirteen Jefferfon ehrc- j n a
tors, jutl as far as respects the circumllance of vot. t (, at

he MACBETH.
a AS l p OOPER ' s r epu:a:ion as an a&or had
â a* flown before him, the public expectation was much '
, us awakened, when the tragedy of Macbeth was an
of . noil,icedl for hts firft appearance. The character of I
Macbeth is to try theutmoft talents of <
J any nerfortner, a,,,]'fuccefj ensures a solid reputa i- '
he : ,Ir - Coo P" be aware that !>Â« placed him- ]
Ir- 1e1 .'. 1 ? 8 "eonfpjcuous situation, full in the eye of {
n> cntlciftn. If critieifm ts candudted with candor r
p- and decency, he cannot complain tho' it difap- j
id prove : while those wliofe expeflations have been A
I gratified may indulge the pleating task of commcn- *
I dation, he mull expect that those who have not
e _ I beon thus gratified, will express their disappoint- J
, r _; ment and mark his errors. 1 mull confefs lam 5
, e j among the latter class, and that Mr. Cooper fell ve
e-j ry far short of my idea of Macbeth/ i feel the
>e more confidence in my opinion, because Dramatiâ  ~
cvs, the 11 lend and panegyrilt of Mr. Cooper, in
k forms me his Macbeth was not well received in
>f ~ on dojÂ» } becaiife I underlie,nd lie wa, not more
ls luccefsful in Baltimore ; and beennfe I know he
d w*s not so here. When Drcmalicus speaks of the 01
e universal applause given to Mr. Cooper on Friday, ft
y he mufl be conscious he has Brained a point to serve p
his Trierva. 1 bi?p!aÂ«di:s were as unfrcquent, fnint
j Â®" d cold ' co _"'d be given to any to'lerable per
-0 on his firft appearance. It cannot be dc- th
1 n ' t " at r - Chalmers (tho* very unequal to the
. charaScr) received vaflly more applause ; and 1 Ci
mult confefs, if I may judge from the interefl (fx
e cited in tny own heart he dcferVed the preference :
> this opinion 1 fliould scarcely have ventured to e ffer C "
. it I were not ftrerigtbeued in it, by finding it pre- fir
i "tlmg among o,oft of those with whom I have co
convened 01 , the fuhjeft, and many gentlemen of
f dtHinguifhed Ineraturc and tafle. Mr. Cooper 1,11
' kn Â°w to Â° veil what the uiviverfal applause of a\ â¢
crouded theatre is, to believe that he rccsived it on
' rnday night.
' r Ii? e ? rft . ,h '. n K ,0 ht 0 fcrved '"" lhc pffformance re'
; of Macbeth, iÂ» the striking Jnnjien of hisch..r,c
---: Cer 7-^ a cbeth, the noble, brave, and faithful, is
entirely diihiyft from Macbclh, the murderft, trai-
I tor, and regicide : this difcriminatioa of his iha
rafte â¢is finely observed by Mr. Ruliardfon, iu his D;
criticisms on f#mc of the piincipal charadteia of 4 l a
ohakefpeire : -lie has traced wilh much talte and Fr;
judgment the progress of this change in the mind
and character of Macbeth. Mr. Cooper wa, oâe,
and the f.me man, acting in different fittiations, lu:
from the beginning to the end of the play ;he "
was not at one time the dignified hero, and then
the rel'hite, abandoned, despairing villain. He fen
not only f,iled in diflinju.fhing the change in Mac- tt><
bell's character, but by itrfqrrte fort lifemjing'thrm, pai
loft both. His whole demeanor, aCtio-i u..d ap- ' l 0
pearante was not that of the dignity of aanly ~r . c f â 
tue, struggling under too much temp'ation, and sal r A' !
ling thro' the ambition and artful intrigues of a da
rrng woman ; but that of a cowardly affaifm, who fori
feared, the dritS'tcn, not the conmlJjF.on of his crime, ous
IHe created nointeteft for Macbethâno fytnpothy fro
for his fallâl followed him, from bis crime to his â â 
punifhr.-Bt, with no other fecli.igs than I should
have had at the exesution of an Italian a'ffaffin.
There was nothing dignifiedânothing foblime, in Rtl
his mariners and deportment. Through the whole
of the firft adt he was aukward and uninteresting.
from the commencement of the zi adt he rose, but 1
never rose to Macbeth. His manner and aaion
throughout the whole pl*y, were forced, embarraf. Ov
fed, and very deficient in grace. The expressions Sor
of Mr. Cooper's countenance were forced and me- c< "
chanical ; not arising immediately from the fenti- Ital
ments and feelings of liis foul, or fpecifically adap- Mil
ted to them. His emphasis was frequently rnifpla
ced. An-, -ng others I recollect one remarkable in- i '
fiance. WJien the king was out of the way there Son
was nothing to obftruft the full completion and Prii
fifety of Macbeth s ambition, but Banquo and his Ov
son. He recollected the predidlion of the wayward
fillers on this fubjeft. He represents to himfelf the J
daritg Jpirit ai d dtunlhf, temper of Banqwo, and Gei
his fears of him. As an evidence of this daring
spirit, he fays, narr
He chid ths fillers when they put the name p '
of king upon me"âwhich Mr. Cooper repeated Hal
thus * â  Sin
"He chid thzjijlirs whet) they put the name of b
king upon ltie." fubl
If 1 understand the meaning of the line, the rhl
emphasis should be placed thusâ sixl
" He chid the filters whan they pot the nameef
ting upon me. A
The spirit of Banquo is shewn by his daring to
chidt the fillers ! And for what did be chide them M C
âfor putting the name of king upon Macbeth and
not on him. The beiutiful soliloquy which begins beh
" if it were dune, when 'tit done, See." is a so- vern
lemn deliberation in the mind of Macbeth, upon
the deed befoie him, viewing it in it's most horri
ble filiations, its deepest confequen. jr,
ces. If this is the cafe, it should not have been ]
spoken with the angry violence which Mr, Cooper
gave itâAt thephrafe " we'd jump the life to
come," Mr. Cooper gave a motion to his body,
imitative of jumping, by riling suddenly on his toes
and bending forward j this may be called punning
in In short, it was evident throughout
that Mr. Cooper was aÃing.
If he is to be eonfiderrd as a young performer,
he is certainly very promifir.g; but if as the com
petitor or Itibftitutc of Mr. Fennel! ,he has much to
learn and acquire. Hii addrtfs to the airy dagger
-his return from the murder of Duncan, with the H;
bloody daggers in his handsâand his recital of that <1Â°".
beautiful speech, "(he should have died hereafter,"
4c. were peculiarly fortunate.
