They talk of a conliderable armament preparing
at Brest for an expedition, the objeÂ£l of which is
not positively known. A citizen just arrived from
thence, and whÂ® staid 'twere 6 days afTures lis that
there is no less than 90,000 men engaged in it.
The pacification in La Vendee, and in the country 1
of the Chouans, gives to the government thousands 1
of men, of whom theyr are resolved to make a good
use. They are determined to flr'thc tuhti-e the iron's

It is without doubt, for (he purpose of being at
lead orice faithful to its title, that the Journal of
Patriots of '89, reports with interest the homage
paid to La Fayette, at the entertainment which
took place <he 17th Meflidor, in memory of the
anniverfaiy of the day on which the Americans de
clared their independence. It fhoald be remerti
bered, that La Fayette is only so horribly pcrfecu

fhonlo be recolltfted how frightful it is to fufFer a

for having fcrved the cause of liberty. He only
alks to live in America, not to afford him the means,
would be to second the fury of England, Auftriaj

" If we attempt to persuade you that our city

critical lituation ofthofein the Weft ; the sources
of fubfiitence obflru&ed ; the inhabitants impovc
ii!h!d by contributions ; the decline of commerce ;
the diminution of the manufactures ; all tend to
exhibit out too true and too melancholy a pidture
of our failen country !âAnd the incomputable ex
actions, the extraordinary exertions bellowed on
the marine, uncommon addition made to the
land forces, the solemn summoning of all burghers
to defend their country; js it not so many tokens
of dijlrefs ? so many proofs sf danger ; so man- e
vident signs of the ehaftifiiig hand of Godlike juf-j

" But 'torn whence came these mifeiies ? and
where m\ifl we enquire for the foutces? In our

ambition, in fordid interefl, or dcteftable voluptu

to render society happy, in degenerating from re

disunion and party-rancour, that, like an eating

brought it to a skeleton.
"Snould we, then, remain indifferent fpe&ators
of these accumulating evils, and not Endeavor to

that pbffers being employed on the behalf of the '

The rounfel for the plaintiff contended, that if any
debt was paid by a tradesman, in contemplation of
his becomming a bankrupt, v.ith a view to bestow
an undue preference to a pirticular creditor, fnch

ENCOURAGEMENT TO FARMERS fl
TO IMPROVE THEIR STOCK. h
On the 3d isift. were fold by Harry Dorfey Gough, u
Â®f Baltimore, Nine Ball Calves, which are from a g

Lincolnfliire, at the following prices :

46 doilars each. ( f
The above gentleman, a few months ago, fold 1 j
Bull for 100 dollars, which weighed one thousand and j
twenty-two pounds.âlf these great weights and prices
can be obtained by improving the breed of cattle, it i
is well worth the attention of Farmers who feed and '
raise Hock. A number of gentlemen in Maryland, we t
are informed, have associated for the purpose of im
porting the belt Itock that can be met with from v
England, which cannot fail to be of great fervke to j
this country. ' (
Ancona, of which the French have lately taken 1
pofieffioh, and which, by'the armistice lately con- '
eluded wit!) the Pope, they are to retain until the !
end. of the war, will prove an important acquifi- '
tion ; as the cruizers they will be enabled to fit '
cut from fhat port will probably make rich cap.
turn, and greatly distress the British.Levant trade. '
Ancona is a very ancient town of Italy on the gulf '
of Venice. As commerce has rapidly increased of 1
late years, Pope Clement JCII having made it a '
free port and built a mole, on the mint of the an
tient one of the Emperor Trojan. Near this stands 1
his triumphal arch, next to the Matfon Quarree
of Nifmes, the moll entire monument of Roman
magnificence at present in existence.
Leghorn however will prove a far more import
ant acquisition, as the exclusion of their enemies
t fiom that pott mill be a great blow to.them. The
British will now be cortfined to Gibraltar and the
ports of Corfjca.
Leghorn was a free port, and merchandize
brought there was never ir.fpefted, the officers of
the city taking great care that the trade of the city
may meet with no interruption, There is hardly
a. finer harbor in the Mediterranean. It is 14.J
miles N. W. of Rome.
A clause in the treaty with the Pope stipulates,
that 500 manuscripts (hall be delivered up. As
thefeare to be chosen by the French themselves,
there can be little doubt but the most rare and va-
Itlable will be fele&ed. This circutnftance will pro
bably oerafum not a little fpaculation, andexpefta
tion will be on the gape after fotre wonderful dis
closure. It is well known that an immense number
of manuscripts hare been collected and deposited
in the Vatican from Arragon and various patts of
Italy and Greece at different periods.
Nothing very interelHng to the liteiaty world
has ever been divulged. Now that they are likely
to pais into the hands of a nfiore inquilltive people,
.we may poffib.ly be treated with many precious dif
ejofures.

Mr. Editor,
AS I was passing thraugh one of the principal
ctree s in the titj ; my sensibility was Ihocked be
yond measure, at the barbarous conduct of a Cart
man towards his hotfe. The poor beast was hauling
a very heavy load up a small rife of ground, in
which lay b (tone oi tin .oniicoa (vii, and against '
which, one wheel of the cart was let ; the horse
t (for I viewed him with critical attention) made fe
i veral iueffedtual efforts 10 fur mount the obllacle ;he
r (trained until his laborious breathing was painful to p
the ears of those who ilood at a diltance ; and his ( .
inhuman mailer, instead of giving him time to reco-
'ver his breath and strength, or of removing the
ftoHe, turned the butt-end of his whip, which was (
t the size of a small sapling, and beat the horse over
- his head and eyes, until the sweat flowed from eve-
ry port, and the poor animal in an agony of dif- q
r trels, Â«oaned mojl bitterly.
e Goci of compajfion ! ctied 1, is it thus the works
II of thy hands are made the sport cf mans cruelty!
Is this the reward which the faithful and laborious
btute is to receive for his painful feivitude ? W3B it q
for the gratification-of the malignant paflions oi
human natuie, that the benevolent creator of the g
i, univeife, placed man as Lord of his lower works,
a and made the beasts of" the field, and the birds of
e the air, subservient.to his pleafurs and delight ?
This cruel practice is daily encrealing in our
iirects,>aiid when 1 have fe> n the attention of Uran
gers arrelled by fcencs as above described, I bave |
bluflied for the place that gave me birth, and lilent- ,
St ly asked myfelf, whether jhtle men could be the de
fce'idauts of the humane avid philanthropic PtN>Â». â 
* lam not a profelTioual and yet 1 confefs i
>s have ever been pleafeH with that part of their reli /
it g ,on Â» w hich impofesou its votaries, a sacred regard
l( j to the rights of hofj,itality and humanity, whether
ic they refpeft man or bead.
The painful sensibility cxpetienced by those, c
whole feelings are not callous to every feniimenvof g
0 humanity, is not the only evil which results from i
this abominable and helJifh practice ; but the effedt
, n which it his on the tender and impressive minds of 1
children, before whose eyes the exhibition is daily t
le and hourly made, is of a more serious and import
- taut nature. âMan is an imitative animal, and from r
j t " the reverence with which a child looks up to those 1
who are farther advanced on the stage of life, (in- i
e capable himfelt of investigating causes. and piinci- 1
pies,) he conljders every action and thing/done and 1
n f performed, as a fit of imitation.âHence ari
a fes that propensity to cruelty, exercised by children (
n towards the puny tribes of anima/t and infeHs, they (
j, cannot torture a horse, but they can murder a jly. j
And the young mind becoming familiarized to acts t
ln of barbarity, both by example and practice, loses (
that tender sympathy, that keen sensibility at ano
t_ ther's woe, which is at once the highest ornament of
cs Â»uman nature, and the produdtive source of nume
[ lc rnus bleflingj and felicities ill private and fifcial
he life -
May it not be expected from the enlightened
ze policy of the present day, that some measures will
Q f be devised and adopted, that will at leait check,
if not completely eradicate, a pra&ice which is dif
!ly graceful to the charaÂ£ter of raen and of chriftians.
j. The writer ot the foregoing remarks, invites the
attention of his fellow citizens to this intereding
â g fubjeft, and he flatters himfelf, that the cause of
humanity will never want advocates in a oountry,
profefling a religion, which inculcates lipowits fol
fa lowers a sacred and Conscientious regard to the d'ic-
Q _ Utes of merify, juflict and bcnevolence.
STOCKBRIDGE, September if.
Description of a'-vety singular atmospheric phe
nomenon,'as seen at Stockbridge, and several neigh
boring places, on Thuifday, September 1, 1796.
The defer ipt ion is aÂ« nearly aocurate, as could be
, given, by the judgment of an observer.
J Between the hours of 3 aud 4, P. M. the ftin
.j.' became gradually encompassed, by a circle, or ha
' 10, of usual size and appearance. Direflly under
the fun, was a mock-fun, in which was nothing re
markable, unless it were its unusual fitua'ion.
the mean time, the fun hecairle interfetted, at the
centre, by the segment of a white, luminous circle,
exactly parallel with the hoiizon ; which continued"
ra- extehdirg until within a few degrees of meeting,
he at the point opposite the fun, in the east. Above,
ive on either fide, at north and south, were two large
he fegmuits of circles, which, continued, wbiild have
ta- interfered each other, and the before n?entioned
he circle, at the fun and opposite point, obliquely,
he making, on ei'ther fide, an anglt of iz or< 15 de
grees. In these, the diffeteiitly colored rays of
r light were dir-rfifieJ, the red rap appearing ou
i the interior fide of the curwe. Above the fun. Ext
arfd exterior.to the halo, were two fcgmriit6 of cir
f cles, ps somewhat larger, size than the halo, and
r containing each, about 40, or 45 degrees. These
came 10 contadl, each with the other, and oblique* 0
!y with the halo, dircftly above the sim, so as to che
- form, on either fide, an angle of about 30 degrees. eve J
3 Still higher, aboHt the diftancc'of 4$ degrees from .
- the fun, and parallel with the halo, was another ln c
segment of a circle. In this and those lalt men
3 tioned, the colouis were separated, and the red " b
e rays interior. On either fide of the fun, at north ' lau
tr and south," about the diltance of 45 degrees, was " u
, the fegmeot of a rainbow inverted. Each of these al,
3 began, at a frtisll dillance above the horizon, and 3 ' e
e included about 25 or 30 degrees ; âred rap on the

J exterior of the curve.
ri Previoufl) to the above described phenomenon,
e there had been little or no rain, for fevctal weeks, ' *â¢
t so that, at this time, thje drouth was severe. The ot

London, July 18 in!
It was annnouticed fomÂ« davi ago, that \he re<
? French intended to establish a direst communica
ls tion between the army ot the Upper Rhine.and that i"l
' of Italy. Kcllerman'a army appears to be deftin- p a
ie ed to form this jiinftioa ; and there are accounts at
,S which state, that in purftiance of that plan, he has th
~ r marched from the Vale of Aotta, in order to pene
irate through the Valteli fC, and the country of the set
Gnfons, to eftshlifh hmfelf in the lake of Con- O
fiance, and take Tyiol in the rear, with a view ot fei
forcing the impetial army to abandon that country.
' This end being attained, he will probably extend a V
! 6 chaio of pofnions tu the right/, along the lake of (Â°
" Garda, for the purpose of ellabbfhirig a communi 3 \
cation with Buonaparte; 3nd to the left towards T
16 Suabia, to enhble him to j iin she right wing of Mo
*!. rean'sarmy.
a If we may credit a 1 tter from St. Gall, of the
z6ih of last month, inserted in the lalt Paris papers,
iV he has already* crofted the country of the Grifons,
n " and made himfelf master of Bregentz, It remains
* c to be k'low'n, whether the detachments from the
Upper Rhine, destined to reinforce the army in Ty- B
e " rol, hive rtached the lakt of Conflance early enough S
N ' to check Kellerman's further progress ; and vvhe

" Deaf Friend,
" Every thing here wears a better profpeft than
of late : Tlie sickness is over, provifnmj arcroOch
cheaper, and we have hopes of fihe crops, anti arc
every where fuccefsful. \
" Jeremie having been attacked by the Brigand*
in confcauence of treacheroos communications from
within the fott, was gloriously defended by the in
habitants and the Britilh, whochaftifed them by a
(laughter of about 800, obliging- their chiefs, Dcf
fourneaux and Rigaud to run away with equal fhan>e
ar.d precipitation, although their deluded followers
are taught to believe them the braved and grcateft
generals; indeed it may be so in matters ot ucV
ehery and intrigue, not in the field of Mars.
Â«' About the fame time Cour,tde Bruges, with
the Legion de Montalembert, and a large body of
other emigrants on the borders of the
met Tonfiaint LoUverture, having five thousand in
fantry and four hundred cavalry under his command,
he had been ordered by Sonthonax, with his pro
clamation, inviting the emigra'nts'and inhabitants to
revolt and join him. The brigands, with the great
est confideac, attacked the emigrant troops at Mi
rebalais, but the former totally ruutedthe infanry [
a considerable part of the cavalry daltardly ran a
way, and facrificed the main body j tv *lve â¢ hun
dred of which were found dead oa the field of bat
tle ; the remainder were fcatteved and died is the
j woods and drowneii in the Artibonite, Major
Ogorman writes to that he had never Teen fucli
a number of dead since hostilities commenced in
this lfland. The pursuit was rapid and truly bril
liant, such as to secure a fuccefiion of vi&ories.â
Tins defeat enabled the coynt de Bruges to enter
y the Sp.inifh co'ony } distant 7 leagues from Mireba
lais, 25 trom Cape Francoij, 22 from Port-au Piince
f and 64 from St. Domingo the capital". When
. they have taken post at this place, a communication
will be opened with St Cento Chri'ii, as soon as
the British fleet has arrived there, whither I am
informed feveial (hips of the line have gone, at ihc
f request of its inhabitants.
"On entering the Spanish colony, many of the
[ inhabitants fled, until being apprised of the rÂ«fpeÂ£l
. paid and proteflion given to those who remained
s at their homes, when they all wturned and took
s the oath of allegiance to his Britannic Majesty.
" Count de Bruges speaks of his army as cumpo
c fed of real heroes, ar.d with great plaudits of Major
Ogormah, hoping his tttajefty will ever be as well
f served by his new*and faithful fubjefls, as on the
late fucceiV&l events, commencing at Mirebalais.â
a Vanfou, who a year ago was in goal kir high trea
if son, has made his escape, it is said was the head of
a parry to rife in a revolt at the firll appearing of
