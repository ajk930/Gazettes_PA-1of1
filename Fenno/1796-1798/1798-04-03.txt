Q.KNTLSMEN t
MJUfn the legislature of a great and free
jwopk is convened atau ireportantand threat
ening crisis we naturally expert from it foitte
uHQoirirtion prute&ion, to their rights and li
bei ties.
If we are deceived, and instead of great
exerlious for security, a (hameful neglect of t |
Â»verj ordinary means takes place ; vvc are m
to enquire the cause of such desertion of A
duty 5 the mind is uneasy if it cannot 11
aiSx a proportionate apology.
Perh.ips It may be thought too bold if I
publicly declare my opinion ; but as lam w
sincere I scorn to fupprefa the inclinationâ
It is tha lirft privilege in a free government w
to speak your mind ; it iq a privilege I glory e:
in and which I (hall now exert; truth un- Â°
d*r whatever fignatute loses nana of its force
it carries cofivi&ion tp king and peasant. w
I conceal not my name from fear Â®f pan- A
ifliment > for I mean not to violate any one fc
Vw of my country; I Â«fpe& and revere 0
them and-it is for their prefervatian I write. "
Why Ido not disclose mjrfelf is to avoid "j
personalities which would unavoidably hap- j
pen and thus divert the attention from the fc
main ohjedt of these letters. e<
The aid which the French government P
gave to America in her contest with En- P
glandwas repaid on oiirpart (andjuftly too) j
with esteem and gratitude ; from that period
there has subsisted a mutual attachment ; f- c
and the revolution which has just been ef- n
feÂ£ted there, joined to the brilliant fuccels tl
that has conllantly attended their arms ; has T '
heightened this attachment (in the breads
of a large poition of our citj-z-ens-) to the a ,
wioft extravagant enthufiafnv. t>
This growing affection was observed by 1)
tJjfi French republic with peculiar fatisfadli- it
cnâ they were too cunning not to take adr
ventage of it. Dazz-led by the splendor of P
thÂ«ir victories and the novelty of the scene,
which a sudden change from one extreme to w
another rjjuft produceâa change by which e
tjbc ahfolnte government of twenty-four Â«
millions of people is wrested from one man n
and divided anvmgft themselves ; they yield- 1'
ed up the-control of tbe passions and indulg
ed ill all the excefles ps vice and follyâfor 1
their follies an apology from the impartial ls
and thinking roan can soon be obtained. <j
Human nature iti not endued with for- tl
titude fnfficient to_jvithftaud so great a tor- '
Â«sent of prosperity, it turns us giddy and al- ?
mod incapacitates us for thinking. But for "
vices such as theirs no excuse can be framed, 3
they mull proceed not from an over heated 0
imagination that magnifies an error into a d
criuve, but from villainy daep rooted in the
heart ; for they ftopt not after the firft im- v
pulse of zeal in the new cause had subsided ; t
but continued to wade deeper and deeper in '
human blood and flay one another in a cool 0
and deliberate manner.
Thus, Ikilful in the blacked crimes and f
heated with an insatiable ambition, it is no r
wonder thatiftie is nofcfatiefied with the con- t
queil of near half of Europe, but that the J
fubjeijtioo of America must decorate her
pompous littv j

ftitutions and fubilituting in the room a a
mean and fervilt dependence on a foreign t
power. This game is now playing here, I 1
and T hlufluto own, with too much (uccefs. 'j
It has even penetiated the walk of your as- y
fembly, where a large junto of servile jac- r
obins furioufty oppose every mcafure of the j

This li evident from the whole tenor ot f

SINCE issuing proposals for publilhing my
Enquiry into the Origin as Epidemic Dif- '
. eases, 1, find many people have the impression :
that this work is t.v'jc a revision and enlarge- s
ment of the Letters which I publilhed Taft ;
: Autumn on the fubjedt of the Yellow Fever. (
It is necelftry to impreffion from .
the public mind. The work proposed is al- '
together new; tho a few of the facts and con- 1
clufions llated in my printed letters will be I
' wrought into the intended volume. 1
The'tpieftion to be decided, is not simply ,
what are the origin and phenomena of the dif- (
â¢ ease which lias alarmed and scourged our cities ; |
but what is the reason why malignant or pesti
lential diseases prevail at fooie times more than
' at others ? If the cause is imported infection, 1
why is infection imported into all ports of ;
â  America in one season, or in one period of
: four or five years, and the* for a long series
. of years, is not imported at *ll ? Are malig
nant epidemics confuted to fMrtfcular" -places
j or countries; or are they pr<- in many '
or mod parts ef th 4 world at the arae time?
" If so, and we find that'they spring up in dif
'â  ferent parts of the world at the fame time,
communication by infection cannot be the
t principal cause, and we must resort to # other
principles.
, I hinted at this circumstance in my printed
letters, but was not then prepared to discuss
' 4he (object. I have however ascertained the
faft, that epidemic diseases usually appear in
many or mod parts of the civilized world at
the fame time, and not only on land, but on
the ocean, and on the opposite fide of the
globe.âlt is equally ascertained, as I- suspec
ted from my own oblervation, that violent
and dellruftive epidemics are aliuerrs preceded
by diseases of a less malignant type, and near
ly in the order in which they have prevailed
in the United' States, viz. Catarrh, anginas,
bilious remittents of encreafed malignity or
â¢ petunial fevers, yellow fever, or plague. This
progress or fotnething similar is obfervjble of
all the great pestilences that have ravaged the
world. The taÂ£ts to prove this principle in
epidemics, and the order of them, will be so
elearly ascertained, as to render it impossible
not to forefee the approach of a peltilential
period.
From this fail, will be deduced mod fatiS
faÂ£tory explanations of some points which now
, occalion controversy among medical men. It
is alfodemonftrafed beyond all controversy or
doubt, and I polTefs full evidence of tfre fcrtt,
that when any great pedilence is laying-waste
those countries mod obnoxious to it, as Ca:ro
or Conftantiriople, the mortality is augmented
in all parts of Europe. But this is not all ;
the influence of the pestilential (late of the
armofphere, which,in Grand Cairo, produces
1 plague, produces in America some malignant
1 disease which swells our bill, of mortality.
e Ido not speak of llight plagues which pre
- vail in the Levant cities almoCt yearly, from
â¢ the dperation of powerful /ocalcmiCes ; but of
â those great and general plagues which in the
I course of every period of twenty or thirty
years, carry oft' thousands in a d(Â»y. in Cairo
and Conftautinople, and often extend to more
3 healthful citjes. So uniform is this pheno
-0 menon, that give me correct bills of mortaili
. ty for the principal cities in Europe and Ame
e rica, ( and I can tell when a dedruiitive plagua
has ravaged the Levan., without one particle
r of other intelligence of the fact.âThe fame
dreadful plague 111 Egypt in,1736, which car
- ried off several thousands in a day ip Grand
n Cairo, was cotemporary with that dedruflive
s fore throat in America, which our old people
e (till men'ion with horror.--The yellow feveV
j ofi74i in Philadelphia, and of 174.3 in New-
York, c'orrefpond in time with another gene
s ral pedilence which ravaged the Levant ci
-5 ties. The fame was the vy\ith the yellow
1- fever of 1761 or 2in Philadelphia, which was
s during the great plague of'which Riiffel I has
n given so particular an accpunt. At the fame
time the bills of mortality in London were
= fwelied tVorti the u(ua ; number of about 20,00*
0 and in 1740, to 30,000. The lad
' .epidemic under which we are yet smarting,
a and which lam afraid is not yet at an end,
n tho evidently lighter than many that have
happened within two centuries, has been felt
' in the Weft-Indies, South America, on the
African coast, and our unhappy countrymen,
who have been.prifoncrs fn/Vlgiers, can wit
" ness forme that its eft'eclshave been fatally ex
f periencedin thut country.
' Why tliefe great andintereding
e have been nearly overlooked and disregarded,
i- while rulers of nations have been busy in com
bating the importation ofpe.dilence in bags of
cotton and old rags, i 3 to me aftoli;{hing.<â
p But it is often.the dediny of man to overlook
r the mod obvious thing.
II Â» ' "
The .primary causes of general psdiience, it
maybe difficult toafcertain; but I have no
n helitation in faying, that it must be an alter
'> ation in the chemical properties of air. It is
clearly demonstrated bv evidence in my pol
y fellion, that changes of season are not" adequate
.. canfes ; for the worlt plagues-have broken out
in high northern latitudes, in tlie- wdft of
winter.
The season* have material influence on the
general ltate of health ; and local.causes haye
s still nioreinfluenceiner&rarjaptnmxial diseases.
" 13ut it will he made clear that some more pow
erful caule is always combined with these fnb
- ordinate ones, in producing the more general
f and malignant epidemics. What this cause ij
1 will not. undertake to decide. The question
has. hi tho to baffled enquiry; but there are
e hopes that some light will tie thrown on tbi,
" part of the.frbje^.

NEW-YORK, March 27. :
The author of the refidenee in France, 1
now publifhiwg by a Mr. Davis, and who is ]
said to be a lady, has a very happy talent at 1
dcfcribing the (cents thÂ«c took plsce in j
France, as well as the characters of the ac- 1
tcrs. The following description of the dif- i
ferent charaitera of thÂ« Fuench and Englii , Â£
is extremely just and Â«xa<3. !,(
" The conduct of Fouquier Tinrille,Jiai j t
led m'e to some refleftions on a subject which! 1
I know the French consider as matter of 1
triumph, and as a peculiar advantage their
national character enjoys over the Eugli(hâ}
I mean that smoothness of manner, and '
guardednefe of expreflion which they call'
" amiable," and which they have the facul- (
ty of attaining and preserving diftinft from j J
1 a correspondent temper of the mind. It 1 j
accompanies them through the moll irritat-11
ing vicissitudes, and enables them to deceive ! 1
even without deceit, for though this suavity 1
is habitual, of course frequently undefign- â 
ing, the dranger is nevertheless thrown off (
his guard by iti and tempted to place confi- j
dence, or expedl fervicea, which a less con- ;
' ciliating deportment would not have suggest
ed. A Frenchman may be an unkind huf
' band, a severe parent, or an arrogant inaf
, ter, yet never contrast his features or afpi
, rate his voice, and for this reafoh is, in the ;
f national sense, "un homme bien doux."â
i His heart may become corrupt, his priaci
-5 plas immoral, and his temper feroeiotii;
yet he (hall retain his equability Â«f tone and
, complacent phraseology, and be "un hom
' me bien amiable.
The revolution has tended much to deve
> lope this peculiarity of the French charac
: ter. Fouquier Tinvillc was a man ps gen
r tie exterior. Gouthon, the execrable affoci
-1 ciats of Robefpirre, was mildness itfelf.â
3 Robespierre's harangues are in a stile of
: didinguifhed sensibility, and even Carrier,
1 the destroyer of 30,000 inhabitants of
1 Nantz, is attested by his fellow students, to
J have been of an amiable difyofition. I know
a man of mod insinuating address, who has
t been the means of conducing his own bro-
I ther to the guillotine. The philophic Con
- dorcet pursued his patron, the Due de la
Rochefoucault, with malignancy, and Col
' lot d' Herbois dispatched at one discharge of
s eannon three hundred people together, to
f " spare his sensibility," the ta(k of execu
e tion in detail.
II Without deciding whether the Englilh
3 are more geatle in nature than the French,
'j lam persuaded this douceur of the French is
no proof of the contrary. An Englishman
is seldom out of humor, without proclaim-
ing it to the world ; and the mod forcible
t motives of interest or expediency, cannot
r always pre*iil on hira to assume a more en-
V" gÂ»ginjr cxtcrmd than thee which dclirn-ates
e his feelings. If he has a matter to refufe,
1 he usually begins by fortifying himfelfwith
a little ruggtdnefs of manner, by way of
e prefacing a denial. " The hows and whens
s of life" corrugate his features and difharmo
t nize his periods, " contradi&ion fours and
paflion ruffles him." .
It is this difference of charafter which has
" a prodigious influence ever the political fuc
-1 cess of the two nations. If aA Englishman
y has designs upon you, his manners tell of
o |he plotâand the dratagem carries with it
e its own defeat. If he means to dp you a
- favor he does it with such an ill grace, tfct
- it is a chance you do not thank him for it.
e the fame in his manner, whether to do you
e a favor or to plunder youâthe fame civility
of manners, the fame ease of deportment
d and fafciiiating smile, introduce the proposed
e fchejcc ; and even after he is dete&ed jr.
y a villainous trick, you are so pleased with his
. address ; as to almod furgive him."
LONDON, Nov. 20.
~ There is no nation that eqaah the Eritifh
iS for strength of charaiterâno nation so ca
s pable to contend with adversity. The pre
e sumption of France, in imagining that it ri
e vals Rome, is only ta be surpassed by the
* falfehood of the supposition. The Frencl*
possess a degree of enthusiasm, that has a
i' splendid outside, but falls very (hort of that
e equanimity which characterized the Romans:
It The proof of genuine courage, is the for
le titude with which it fudains a reverse of
'Â» fortune. It is that unlhaken condancy
" which animated that great people, at a time
when Harmbal befieg&l t!leir very gates,
that taught them even in that extremity,
| t to despise the conqueror, and abfointely to
fell the ground oft which he-had encamped
>f his army. Fear was a dranger to their foul*.
- Are the French such a nation ? Let but a
k battle or a dratagem fail, and where is this
Roman resolution? Have tbey not fled like
!t hunted dags, before armies of Germans,
0 inferior, both in numbers and difcipliiie ?
j s Again, the Romans were a magnanimous
. and a generous people. Do the French re
e femble them in this ? On the contrary, are
it jiot all their victories tarnished with wanton
'f and deliberate cruelty. Of this, both the
Rhine and Italy supply abundant examples.
e Victorious only by dint of numbers, they
0 are cruel by inclination. Their piratical de-
predations on the feaa, and the cowardice
. they display in evety engagement, are in
il conteftible proofs' that their pretended valor
is is that of barbarians, who trud in multitudes
n to crush and ovirwhelm difcipliue.
h What the Frenchmen are not, the Bri.
tifh areâa manly, persevering courage, e
e qually undilmaycd by adversity, and nnin
d toxicated by success, is their condant dif
_ position. It is this temper of pur idanden
(t that makes us so terrible to our Gallican
neighbors, who, vast as their territory is,
and numberless as their armies appear to be,
, are yet incapable of approaching onr coast.
i Nor will they dare to anncry ns, though au
: hundred diredtors inltead of five (hould
prompt them to the enterprize. While the
â  lioa lives, though wpunded, and a prisoner
in his deo, he is ilill the lord of the son ft ;
, i and though the wolves may howl rouut' his
l.cave, the sturdy beatt still lfrÂ«ps then at t
1 ; bay by his well known reputation : a eou-' ,

~ only with life.

Mr. Li vinC stow said, . there appeared to
be two objections to going into a cottwsHttta
of the whole on the state of the union ; feme
thirllfcrthepropofition before it i&of too 1 rifling
a nature to con/lime time ; others, that it iÂ»
of {0 great magnitude, that they wj/h to gain
farther information, and to ha"ve time to con

thought, treated a fubjetl, confefiTedly of
Â«reat iiuportarce, with too much levityââ '
Gentlemen fay yoti do us wrong, when you
place the question before the committee in the
light of a Peace or War question; we have no
idea of going to war. This was the language
of the'gentleman from New-Humpfliire (Mr.
Gordon) particularly. . Had that gentle
man forgotten what had been said by his elo
quent friend from Malfachufetts (Mr. Sew
all) who fits belide him ? That gentleman
had declared, not that war might be expect
ed, but that ?w'ar exists ! Was it unreafona
bVe, after fuel)'a declaration, to come to a re
folutioo which fays that it is not'fcxpedienf *
to resort to war at this time ? He thought the
welfare of the country required it. But th 4
gentleman from Massachusetts did not (lop
here. Though, he said, a defepfive war was
all ne vvifhed for, under our present circum
ftanoes, yet he invoked the Supreme Being,
and wiflied we were in a situation to carry on
an otfenfivt war. Yes, exclaimed Mr. L.
the God of Peace Aas iuvokci in favotifr Of
War; the God of Mercy was called uptyi
to favour a war ofvengeance ! And yet gen
tlemen iVifhto throw an odium upoothofewho
cOme forward with a prupofition for pe,>ce.
Mr. L. said, he wiflied as much as any
member for further information before the
house proceeded in active measures ; but lie
was far from being certain that complete in
formation could be obtained ; he believed
great oppofhioh Would be made to the call ;
in the next place, if called for, he believed the
information would not be lent, he supposed
this from a former refufal madeoll the ground
of Executive authority. He deprecated the
decision ; but he believed, as precedent would
authorize it, it would be made.
Mr. Rutledge thought gentlemen went
much too far on this occasion, in anticipat
ing, notfonly what would be the proceedings
of this house, but also of the President. He
rose immediately after the gentleman from
Georgia (Mr. Baldwin). That gentleman'#
arguments went against a postponement gene
rally, but not against a postponement till Mon
day. That gentleman was furpriled that gen
tlemen Ihould wish for a postponement ; he
, was one of those who excited his surprise. He
was in favour of the postponement of this
question, because the last had been postponed.
He thought the motion for a call of papers
ought to have been pafled ; but not having
. palled, ha wished it to pass before the house
, went into committee on the proposition which
: had undergone some difcuflion, especially as he
did not believe the delay would postpone the
final decision upon it. 'if gentlemen would
agree to pal's over the firft proposition, and gu
011 to the next, which relates to measures for
the defence of the country, he fliould be as
. ready as tliem to go into a committee of. the
whole on the state of the Union. He doubted
not the gentleman from Virginia was anxious
to deliver the speech which he had promised
1 to the committee [Mr. Nicholas informed the
gentleman he would hear 110 speech from him
to-day].- Mr. R. hoped, then, he would not
~ object to the postponement. The gentleman
from Pennsylvania, said he wanted noMufor
j mation. Nor did he himfelfwant it. He h ; id
received a letter from France, which convin
ced him of the perilous situation in which we
flood with that country ; he had fee 11 the
h rench decree ; and he had seen a gazette
which had informed him that the mefTa-e of
the Directory was paired unanimoufiy by the
Council of Five Hundred; but he supposed
, some other gentlemen had not fufficient in
formation, orelfe it would not have been caill
ed for ; and surely gentlemen would not call
fucli to vote upon what they deemed to be a "*
question of war or peace, without it.
Gentlemen had (aid, that the message of the
President had produced a belief that we (hall
be involved in war, and that produce had fa I
len accordingly. He did not believe the fall
was owing to the message, but that it was
the effeCt of the decree ; and asked whether
the President Would not have been criminal if
he had fuffered the drfpatches to have (lent 1
; night upon his table ? He certainly would'
the communication was indispensable '
Mr. Sew at l was sorry to differ in opinion
from his friend front S. Carolina. He was
himfelf against the postponement. This dif
ference, he supposed, arose from that
iran's yielding to the assertion of gemlemen
that the question before the committee of the
queftion of war or peace, which he
himfe.f did not. He neter confide red thÂ«
â¢qneftion in that light. It comes in as a bar to
any measures being taken for the defence of
â our country, or from getting into business,
; j which really concerns the state of the union â¢
what were the motives of gentlemen for
'bringing it thus in, he could not tell The
readiness of gentlemen to come to a decision
upon the question without farther information
proves that they do not consider it as a quef'
tion of war or peace. 11 cannot be doubted"
that it the was called upon tode"
clare war against any nation, they would Inve
aright to expeft that every fact relative to
that nation should be laid before them.
The gentleman from New Yoric, Mr. S
said, had thought fit to (ritude to hint as an'
pealing to the God of Mercy to support us in
a vindictive war. Pwn'.llwnent, Mr. S. f ; ,; c |
was sometimes the triteft mercy ; and if the
â United States could inflict pimifhment on
'France, it might be mercv to that country
And cou\4 any American citizen consider the
fufforings which the French Republic had
â¢brought upon our merchants, our Teamen and
upon our country generally, without ca'llmlr
â¢upon the God of Mercy to enable us to in
flict punilhmen? upon that country ? When
gentlemen fay (ann none (eenitodeny it)that
l'Vancc has given this country ju/t caule ot
war, will they not f.iv France has g lV en us
jn(t catife of v-ngeance ' And is there, said
he a patriot in this House,[who acknowledges
France hus given us jult cause of war, and
who does not wish to infliCt that war ur o i
that country m trhe Jeverefi and fuliea man-n?r ? It was impofTible to prevent the wi(V "
He could npt himlelf forbear making uTe of i
the exprelfion with which the gentleman >.
found fault; he could not refrain from calling j c
Upon Gofl to enable us to avenge our wrongs. ,J
Gentlemen aft perfectly ready, without c
know inu how outenvoys have been treated, to , /
declare in Uvour of peace. Mr. S. noticed J
what had been said about the meifage of the /
â¢ President having caused the fall in the price t
of produce, and called upon gentlemen to <
point out that part of it which was calculated
to produce that effect. This fall of produce, /
he said, was only one of the consequences art - <
sing from the wrongs which France has mHi -t- <
ed on this country. If (he had received our j
envoys, no such thing would have happened ;
and could the President be blamed, because .
he communicated the enormities of the French
Republic to Congress ? Certainly he ought
not; tine whole mifchief ought to be alcri- j
bed to the offenders.
Mr. J. Williams was against the pÂ«ft
ponemen*. He had always been ot opinion
that . difcuflion of the proposition which
ha ngagad the House forfome days, wotild | â¢
hav â milcnievous effects on the country. He j,,
wiflietl, . aJ ofdifciiflingthisqueftion,they m
had proceeded 16 measures which weYit to .
placing the country in a (lareofdefence. The i
reduction of the price of produce, he ascribed
more to the apprehension of an embargo rh;m ,
any thing else, and the Senate having decided
against that measure, he supposed the alarm .
Would cease. He thought it had been the
object of gentlemen to alarm the country,and
to induce the people to believe that the Exe- j
cutiveand a part of this House are in favotir
of war, and that tney only are for peace.
Mr. T. Claiborne said, if the debate .
continued much longer, the postponement j
would take place, not from the force of gen
tlemen's arguments, but from the length of
them, as it would soon be time to adjourn.
Mr. R. Williams moved to adjourn,
which was carried.
Adjourned.
Monday, April i.
Mr. Varnum presented a petition from
the inhabitants of Milton, in MaiTachufetts,
stating their alarm at the idea of the peace of .
the United States being placed in the hands
' of men who may not be very friendly dif poled
towards the interest of this tommy, viz. tlio
malh*rs of merchant vefTels, many of whom
were formerly British subjects, and who, tho
they have been naturalized in this country, .
ltill retain all their Englifti prejudices againlt
the French, and may exercise tiffin in a man
ner which may lead us to warâthe declara
tion of which tiwy wifli to remain in the pow
er of Congress ; they also regret the mifun
derfatiding which at present subsists betwixt
this country and France, and trust that every
mean will be taken to adjust it, without hav- .
in recourse to war, which mud wholly aeltroy .
our commerce, and throw the weight of tup.
porting such a (late upon the tanners and
landedÂ°intereft.âReferred to the committee
of the whole on the ltate of the union,
Mr. Allen called up fordecifion the re
solution for certain papers front the Presi
dent of the United"'Statss ; (the conliderÂ«- (
tion ot which was postponed on Friday till j
this day) which having been read, Mr. A.
said, he >"ould agree to the amendments pro
posed, provided the .mover wouid allow the
fame exception to be used, that had been
proposed on a former occasion, viz. excepting
such pari of the said papers as any exiftmg negotia
tion may render improper to be dijclofed.
Mr. Nicho las did not think it would be
in the present fnuanon of things, when
we are told by the President that the negoci
gt;on with the French Republic is at an end,
and that there is no chance of an accommoda
tion taking place betwixt the two countries,
to agree to any exception of th.s kind. Called
upon to act in this desperate ftateof thinks, he
. thought it would nor be right for any part of
the papers which had led to it, to be withheld
from Congress. 1 he President having thought
fit to declare that all negotiation is at an end,
and that he is without hope of an accommoda
tion, it could not be thought proper that the
leziflature fhotild be called upon to act upon
less information than that upon which the
Prelident himlelf had acted, fie thought the
constitution mull have"intended this, when it
placed the power of declaring war in their
hands ; to fuppofeconrrary, would be to sup
pose an abftirditv. With respect o the pro
bability of any part of the papers interfering
with any exiffing negociation, he could uot
conceive that poflible ;at any rate,he thought
it of greater confcqueuce to aCt r.ghtly in this
cafe, than to have reference to any improba
ble c rcumftaiice of that kind. He hoped the
"entleman would agree to withdraw the ex
ception which he had proposed, as to retain
it would defeat the call, by making it liable
to aii ihe objections which were to the former
exception. Indeed, nrithwithftanding he
willied very much for the information called
for, he fhotild vote againlt the resolution, if
the exception was retained. He therefore
moved to ttrike it out.
Mr..Allen did notknow why the gentleman
fro 1,1 Virginia should wish a different form of
resolution from that propoled on a former
occalion. He could fee no reason but this.
He did not believe gentlemen wished to fee
these papers before the house. When the
resolution alluded to was adupted two years
ago, it was not known that any negociation
was on foot j and though the President had
told the house two weeks ago that all nego
ciation was at anend, it might not be lo now.
But fitppoie there was nothing upon whith
this part of the resolution could act, it could
do no harm. He would not, however, give
gentlemen an opportunity of voting against
the resolution. He would withdraw his a
mendment; because he believed the Piefi
dent would be authorized to retain such parts
of the papers, as he may think it improper to
communicate ; he believed his conltitutional
power gave him the right to do this, and that
therefore, it was immaterial whether the reso
lution contained any exception, or not.
Mr. S. Smith called for the Yeas and Nays,
to convince the gentleman of his error, with ref
pttt to ikfie being no dejire for the papers.
Mr.' Hartley wtjbed the qualifications of
the resolution had nit been withdrawn. He
thought it proper. He bad also his doubts 'whe
ther the house could confLtutionally call for the
inftruftions gtven to qui mimfters. Mr. H.
moved, therefore, to amend the resolution by
re-adding the exception juJ! withdrawn.
Mr. Nicholas tijferved, in reply to the
gentleman from Connecticut, th At if our ft tuation
â¢with France is changed Jince the President s last
communication, it mould be ground for a new
mejftigc. But the bouse could not ail upon any
thing, Jo uncertain ; they could alt only upon the
idea of things being nonu in the famejituation as
when the President sent bis lafl message.
Mr. Harper said, -when this question <wat
brought forward on Friday, be moved tbe farther
conjideration of it until to.day. Upon refilling,
however, upon what be thought a conftimtiona!
question, it appeared to him that no such Anftiiu
tional question was involved in tbe present reso
lution. Tbe present call for papers, be fatd,
food upon a very different g round from that made
ivbeii the Sriufb trtaty uoas under conjideration;
tbe objections, oj course, against that call, would M
not apply in the present caje, as tbe papers now
called for were wanted to throw light upon a
| fukjeSf conftffedly within the constitution at powers
los the house. He therefore held tbe call not only
to be cmftituttonal, but expedient. Nor could he
fee any ground for the amendment; if the house
had a conjhtutional right to ask Jor information,'
they had a right to aflt for the whole information,
and the President would judge how far he could,
with propriety, comply with the call. But Jince
the house did not inow that the communication of
any of these papers would be improper, the whole
ought to be called for-, and, if the President
Jhould think it proper to retain a part,, be would
doubtless give fufficient reasons to the house for ec
doing so. On a former occasion, when it was â  w
moved to modify the resolution calling for papers
in the Way now proposed, the motion was re- hi
jecled, because it went to alter tbe principle con- w
tended,, for and he believed tbe fame reason
would lead tola rejection of the present motion, p
i If be believed there Was any constitutional question 'c<
i in this motion for papers, he Jhould vote against , l j
/; but, Relieving the contrary, he Jhould vote in Itl
: fetvourofit, not because he wanted tbe informa- Â°
â  ' tion, as it was fufficient for btm that the President g
i â  told the house that the Negociation was at an end, ' 1
â  and that our ministers were refufed an audience, "
I to induce him to go into every measure of defence 11
i proposed; but as other gentlemen wijbeJ it, he P
[ hoped the rejolution would be agreed to, without "
i amendment. "
: The question on the amendment was negatived, *
1 without a division. >
The question then returned upon the resolution,
â  in the following words :
" Resolved, That tbe President of the United e '
! States be requested to communicate It ibis house, c
: | tbe tnftrufiions to and dif patches from the Envoys n
Extraordinary of. the United States to the French J'
f Republic, mentioned in his message of the i <jth
in ft.'' jj|
i Mr Otis said, before the question was taken,
he would ft,ate his intention of voting against the ,
resolution, not from any doubt of the conftiitutional 'j
right of the house to call for the information, nor
froth an indifpofitton to gratijy those gentlemen j
i who want the information-, but being jattsfied i
, his onin mind that the fails stated tn tbe message,
f .are true, ahd that the Gommiffionets who were p
, sent to Franc? were empowered, not only to fettle j n
1 our d fer.tices with that country, but to make | a
reafonuHe concejjions, even where the injury was |
i on their fide; and the Prejident havrtg declared \ a
it-to be b:s opinion that (here is no hope offuccefs ,(j
( from that hiifftbti, hewifbed for nothing farther j
t to convr.ce bim of the propriety of going into the j,
different defehfive measures proposed. If be had j,
indeed conceived that the queftton ofW'aror Peace
was bef ore the house, he might have wijbed its 0
decision to be delayed until every fait relative to
the negociation bad been before them ; but as he i
r did not conceive that any fucb measure bad been Â£
fta> ted, but only that such dej'enjive measures <â¢
r fbouldbe taken as a much less degreeof dangerthan c
at present existed, would authorize, he was not
[ willing to take any fbare of the refponjibility as
; to the mconvemtncies and evils which may result
from puhhjbmg/ the cor'efpondence in question.
If the difdofure Jbould endanger the fafety of our
Commifjioners, or operate as a discouragement to
the future free communications of our aget.ts a
-1 ! broad, he Jbould ivijb to steer clear of any blame
on the occajion.
Mr. Gaxlatin observed, that, the fame
i reasons, or nearly so, which ha've been men
i tioned by the gentleman from MaiTachufetts,
j as inducing him to vote against the resolution,
! would induce him (Mr. G.) to vote for it.
He had already dated that, viewing the quef
; tion in the light he did, he did not want fur
l ther information to enable him to decide up
on it. He concluded the (fatement made by
, the President is correct; that it istruethatthere
- is nohjpi of accommodation with the French
, Republic, and that all negociation is at an
1 end ; and taking this as a ground upon which ]
to aft, he was willing toact uponit to the belt ,
f of his judgment. Mr. G. said he considered ]
1 part of the measures propoled, to be measures
t of warj though gentlemen called them ntea- (
, lures of defence ; but, when the fubjedt should
. be gone into, he would prove them to be ,
: thole of war; and that the measure adopted j
i by the President, in relation to arming of ,
; merchant veflels, is a war measure. On this ]
i ground, he was ready to vote against any
t such aÂ£ts, and in favour of any thing which
r tended to counteract their effeft.
But, said Mr. G if there are gentlemen .
- on this floor who conceive that, inaddition to
; the information which has been given to the
t House, the dispatches will give to them more
t irritating matterthan they have yet had, which
s may have a tendency to change the opinions,
- of those who, like him, are in favour of peace
: measures, he had no objeftion to their-being
â¢ communicated. He did not expect, however,
i that any thing of this kind would change his
s opinion. The House had had enough of this
r matter last \feflion, and in the late communi
t cations; but on his mind these would produce
i no effect as to the question of peace or war. It
f is true, as hinted by the gentleman last up,
e that some inconveniencies mayarife from the
dispatches being communicated, as it may
a prevent diplomatic characters from exprefling
f themselves freely in future; but the President
r of the United States was not afraid of this, as ,
. during the last feflion he had communicated
e information of this kind, without being ap
e , plied to for it. But if, after having examin
s ed the dispatches, he is convinced it will be
n highly injurious to the public welfare, oren
d danger the fafety of our Commifiioners, or
- prevent the happy iHite of our negociation, to
. communicate the information, he will either
h give it, or state his reasons for withholding it
d to the House.

hour after the fire was flopped, as one of
the engines conduced only bynegroes, who
appeared to be intoxicated, was retufning
furioufly through the street, he was thrown
down by it ; it passed over his left leg and
broke it in a (hocking manner.
From the best information which can be
collected, there is good reason to believe
that the fire of yesterday was the effeft of
some unfortunate accident which originated
in the kftchen of Dr. Floyd, and of which,
aftor a drift investigation made fry.itbe lire"
masters, they have not been able to leafa the
cause.
A !mall house belonging to a Mr*. Scot
tsw a widow, who has fevetalfinall children
and fnpports herfelf and them by keeping
a ichool was pulled down to prevent the fire
fpieadingâa deed of real charity will be
performed, by those who may be so bene
volently inclined as to aflift her in erefting
it again.
At this fire, {he new pateÃt engines late
ly imported from London, and made by
Mr; Bramah, had the firft opportunity of
being fairly tried -their performance is al
lowed by all to be much superior to those
built on the old plan.

I~*HE Subfcribet, proposing to contrafi hit bufv

terras. On it are one Blift and three Air Furnaces,
a complete Boreing Machine, and a very good grift
Mill, with two pair of ft ones ; also a good Forge, all
[ in pcrfeft repair,asate allthe Water Works connefi
â  I cd with thtfe various branches. The Air Furnaces
I were lately built for the purpose of calling Cannon
for this State.âThere are about two thoufaad acres
of l.and, oneh<tlf of which is under wood, theothar
very fine arable Land, producing the bed Hay and
Failure. ThÂ« Cannon lately manufactured there,
fully proves the excellency of the metal, which is
luperior to any in this country, and probably, equal
to any in ihe world ; for not oiie of fixty-nicc Â£ tills
lately made, although some of the 14 were bored
into 32 pounders have failÂ«d on proving. The fix
ation is very eligible, particularly for. this brauch of
9 manufafiurt, asd a place of arms lying in the state
of Connecticut, and only 30 miles from several landÂ»
ings on the Hudson's river, and having every advan
j. tage that can result from a plenty of water issuing
from a large natural pond, very near the Furnace,
ajid which may be converted into a variety of other
' ufeful purpoles. The purchafcr can be accommodat
