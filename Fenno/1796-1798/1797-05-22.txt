Mr. Haxiison > s Letter concluded.
Mr. Harrifon, Di/lricl Attorney of Xeiu-Tork,
to Mr. Pickering, Secretary cf Stale.
New-Tori, \lth December, 1796.
With refpeft to ths second prosecution,
which Mr. Adet fays, " is principally in quef
(ionthe fads are these. During the course
of the examinations in the firft cause against
the privateer, it appesred that a quantity of
arms and ammunition had aftually been ex
ported in her from the United States at a
time when such exportation was prohibited,
and though I had been led to suppose from
fame of the testimony, that thÂ«fe had formed
a part of the privatser's equipment, yet as
this was contetted, 1 thought it-my duty to
file another libel or information, stating the
exportation as a breach of .the prohibitory
law. Mr. Adet is plezfed to fay, that â¢Â« this
information Was made upon the Ample decla
ration of Mr. Giles, marshal of the court,
who as informer was to have his part of the
confifcation." In the firft part of thisafler
tion, Mr. Adet is certainly mistaken. ThÂ»
information was foanded upon the evidence
appearing in the other causes, not upon any
declaration made by Mr. Giles; and as Mr.
Giles was not the informer, but merely the
seizing officer, I do not know that he would
liavÂ« been entitled to any (hare of the prop
etty if confifcated.
After the filing of the second information,
it is remarkable th it capt, Berard (who could
bed have contradifted the allegations con
tained in it, if thfy were not true) does not
appear to claim upon oath, as in the other
causes 5 but rtiia â  tartc is devolved upon .the
French Consul, who could only speak from
information.
In the progress of the cause, however,
the exportation of cannon is denied ; the
muskets attempted at one time to be made
fowling pieces, and at another the property
of pafiengers ; and the powder, with f me
ball which accompanied it, is alledged to have
been part of the equipment of a French fri
gate, and to have heen afterwards replaced ;
but without explaining whÂ«nce or in what
manner the supply to the frigate was obtain
ed.
Under these circumstances, the judge of
the tliltriit pronounced fer.tence of condim
nation againil tie privateer, founding his de
cree upon the exportation of the inufquets,
but without giving any direst opinion ar to
the powder, which in my judgmant formed
the most iiiiportar.t and fetious question in the
cause ; because, it foreign veflels of war
might supply the (hips or colonics of their
nation with ammunition, from their equip
ments, and again replace the fame, probably
by purchases within the United States, ev
ery prudent and nece(Fary precaution to pte
ferve among ub tlie means of defence, might
at the pleasure of foreigners de rendered
â abortive.
The sentence of the Diftrift Court in this
cause having been pronounced, an appeal as
ilated by Mr. Adet, was interposed by the
French Consul at New Yoik, and about this
period a sale of the privateer took place by
tonfent. If the faities intercfted suppose
that this vessel would fell for no more than a
" tenth part of the cod of her armament,"
it was optional with them to have re.'used
their confeÃt. I knop mo law of Congress
such as Mr. Adetjjjkides to, requiring veflels
to be given uprup'on security, under the cir
cumstances dated. No such law was prodti
ced bv the Consul or his attornies, and it
would have been. palpably improper, that a
privateer condemned by the sentence of a
Court of jnftice," {hould by any aft of an offi
cer of the Executive Government go into
the handi of one of the belligerent parties
completely equipped to cruise against its,ene
mies. Such an aft would probably have been
ctfhfidered as a deviation from ftrift neu
trality and might have been productive of
serious coofequences.
In the month of April .last the appeal in
the cafe of the privateer came on to Re heard
before Judge Chafe, in the Circuit Court of
the Diftrift of New York. Whatever
might hate been the expectations of the
consul or his attornies, they did not choose
to reft their cause upon the evidence taken in
the Diftrift Court; but upon the fir(t day
of the hearing produced nc w witnefles. Af
tet these had been heard the argument was
commenced for the appellant â  and answered
on thÂ« part Â«f the respondents ; but as the'
judge plainly intimated his opinion for con
firming the former fenterÂ«e, unless further
evidence could be produced to a particular
point, the appellant's coi:ful applied for and
obtained a delay of two days, and in that in
terval, by some fortunate eafualty met with a
\vitneÂ£s,who had only beÂ»n a few months a:
rlew Yoik, and was able to remove every
difficulty.
Ip confequeiiet of this new evidence, julge
Chaie thought proper to revcife the fei.tt.nce
cf the Diftrift Cuutt. condemning the pri
vateer but" ht net only certified that
tbetÂ« was probable taufe for the piufecutton,
but as the inroeenct of the party had not
been maoiftfted in the early stages of the
cause, he iircfted all the fees of the off.ceis
<<f theÂ«ourt to be paid by the claimant.
As this decree of the Circuit C-urt had
beefl Obtained uuder exttaordinary circum
fiances, and as the quediou rcfj>cÂ£tlnjf the
powder fttll appeared to me of the uimoS
importance, I thought it my dutjr to enter
an appeal to the Supreme Court, and to pre
pare a (late of the cafe, that the superior of
ficers of (jovernment judge whether It
(hould be proftcHtcd or abandoned.
If any further information as to this caufc
(hould be deemed neceltary, 1 mull refer to
the (late of the cafe abovementianed, and
which was tianfmitted by me to the Secretary
of the Treasury. I fiave only further to ob
fefve that I am ignorant how the officers of
the Didrift Court were " interefletTiti the
condemnation of the privateer or her prize."
1 believe that that the fees of the Clerk arid
Marshal were the fame, whether they were
acquitted or condemned : arid I am certain
that as to myfelf, the charges against the
United States did not at all depend upon
that circumstance. 1 hope indeed, that I
(hall at all times be incapable of commenting
or carrying on a prosecution merely with a
vi<w to my own private emolument. lam

[TRANSLATION].
Philadelphia, 29'h Floreal, 4th Year of the
French Republic one and indivisible (18th
May 2796, O. S.)
The Minijlcr of the French Republic
near the United States, To Mr.
Pickering Secretary of State of the
United State/.
Sir,
I HAVE just been informed indireÃly,*
that the House of Reprefentstives hR6 palfed
a Bill for preventing the sale of the prizes
which (hall be brought in by the (hips of war
of the Belligerent powers. If this law did
not appear to me to dedroy tlie efltfts of
our commercial ereaty ; if it did not appear
to me opposite to the duties of an impartial
neutrality, I (hould remain silent ; but thÂ»
interefi of my nation and \he positive orders I
have received on the fubjeft from my govern
ment, oblige me at present to transmit some
observations which seem to me calculated to
merit your attention.
By the 17, and 22, At tides of their com
mercial treaty, the United States and Franc*
agree in an explicit manner, that in cafe one
ot the two powers (hould be at war, its ene
mies (hould be excluded from the ports of the
other, when they (hall have made prizes on
its citizens. When they mutually guaran
tied a free admission of their (hips of war, of
their privateers and of their refpeftive prizes
into these ports,it is clear that they implicit
ly aflured to each other the right of there
felling these prizes. In faft, France having
no continental podeffions in America to
wards the latitude to which English veflels
must go on their return to England, it was
to her of extreme importance to have friendly
ports into which her veflels might conduft
their prizes and fell them, without exposing
them anew to the rid: of the Sea; which
would be the cafe if they were obliged to fend
them to France or to her colonies. It was
also interefling to the Americans engaged in
a war with an European power, to have ports
into which they might conduft and freely
fell their prizes made upon the coall of Eu
rope, without being forced to cross the At
lantic.
These considerations leave no doubt that
by the 17th and 22d Articles of the treaty
concluded between the United States and
France, each nation had implicitly secured
to h'erfelf the right of felling in the ports of
the other the prizes which her snips of war
or privateers (hould have made. This right
which the two nations (hould enjoy has been
acknowledged by our enemies, by the courts,
and by the government of the United States.
Whenever our enemies have a;tacked a
prize made by a pirvateer, it has been only
under the pretext that the privateer had been
armed in the United States, and that (he
had therefore derogated from both the laws
of neutrality and the Presidents proclama
tion.
The American courts have never con
demned French prizes but upon the faft of
having armed in the Uniterl States; and
when the contrary has been fully proved, the
privateer had the right of felling the piizes
without any obstacle. Yet in virtue of what
aft could (he fell her prize ? Of the i2d
article of our commercial treaty. This
article has already afforded a vail field for
difcuilion upon the implied right it appears
to grant to one of the two nations to arm in
the of the other. The American go
vcrrment conceived that this condruftion
could not be given to the 220 article ; it ex
plained itfelf formally in this refpeft ; but
did not objeft to the right of felling prizes ;
it has even expressly acknowledged it, since
it has conltantly permitted the French (hips
of war and privateers to enjoy it.
* This Bill had pafled the House with little
opposition, and by a great majority, being sup
ported by members of all parlies, as founded in
principles ot true national policy./
The patriots in the Senate, unable there to
defeat it inicrted a trifling amendment, which
sent it back nectflarily to the lleprefentativei,
where;.to the alionilhmcntof those, not in the
ftcret, which this letter now explains, Mr. Gal
latin, who had been its advocate, moved to
poflponc it to the next fef&on, for the most friv
olous reafori, (in which France was cautiously
omitted :} The friends of the Bill, some of
whom were absent, not thinking it poflible so
sudden a change could have occarred, were off
their guard, and a majority, properly mtijud,
pdfloticd, and thus defti uyed the bill.
This letter now unfolds the mystery.
Tlit enemies of Fiaace could not accuse
yo jof violating the rules of neutrality by
leaving to her the free exercise of .this right,
a 1! it resulted from the Cafus federis, aud the
obligations prefctibed by a treaty do not lead
a neutral nation from the line of neutrality
whenever (he acquits herfelf of them. There
fore, Sir, the English cannot for that; icsfon
bring i'u their prir.es here. The Secretary
of State afTured me in his letter of 6th July
1795, '* iat ''" 3 Ilipulation of our treaty
fliould be faithfully observed in this tefpedt
by the American government. Since not
withllandiiig the similar right afTuretl to the
king of Great Britain by bis treaty withvhe
United States, it is stipulated tbat it fliould
not derogate from foimcr treaties entered
into by the United States. It is clear there
fore from this, fhat during the whole course
of the present war, we should, iÂ» virtue of
our treaties, enjoy alone she priviledge of
bringing in and felling our prizes here. But
if at present a law existed, prohibiting, in
general terms, the sale of prizes, it would
bear upon France alone ; and at the fame
time, that it deprived her of an advantage
granted by her treaty, it would tend to af
feft the balance of neutrality.
la faft, Sir, French (hips of war and pri
vateers having alone the right of bringing in
and felling their piizes here, it would be the
interest of England, in cafe (he could not
procure the fame advantage, to deprive
France of it: for to take an advantage from
our enemy is a real benefit to us, even tho
we could not enjoy it. Betides, would not
England by tbat means have new chances in
her favor ? If ou- prizes could nolonger"be
fold in your ports thÂ»y must be conducted to
the colonies or to France ; and, would not
the English then have greater opportunities
for intercepting them ? It is evident there
fore that the law procured for preventing the
fa!; of prizes is entirely in favor of the En
glifh,and to our difadvantagc. But if it be
the duty of a neutral nation neither to grant
noÂ» refufe more to one of the belligerent
powers than to another, when there dÂ» not
exist particular ftipulatiop.s provided for by
treaties previous to the war, it follows that
the law in quettion being in favor of Great
Biitain cannot be conformable to the rules
of neutrality.
I venture to hope that you will feel as 1 do
the jullnefsof my obfervatians ; and that the
povernment of the United States, will take
thenecejfary meafurei\' for preventing the ef
fe&s of a law contrary to the treaties and to
the duties of a neutral nation.
Accept, Sir, the aflurance of mv refpeft.

On Friday last flie woman who has'long
advertised her (kill by the nameof Mrs. Wil

Shadwell Policc-Office, for the purpose of
having in her turn, Iferfortune told.
A young lady, who had visited her, having
had fufficient penetration, notwithflanding
V>er previous weakiiefs, to discover that she
was imposed upon, was advised by her friends
to apply to the above Magistrate, who, by
virtue of an aft made for punidiing rogues,

granted his warrant, and the itnpoftor was
foÂ»n after brought before him : she was-f/f
----gantly drejfed, aud was accompanied by a per
son who fnid his name was Redhead, arid
that the lady Was his wife.
The magilliate, indulged her with a chair
in which, she fat down, and instantly fell into
violent hvjieric Jits, from which fns fuon, by
virtue of her art, tecovered herfelf, and Mr.
N. proceeded to his duty. He hea-d the
evidence against the pnfoner, and was about
to commit her for further examination, but
she fell again into fits at the thoughts of be
ing sent to goal, and, on her recovery, prayed
she might be indulged by sleeping' on lier own
bed, and that the matter might be again
heard next day. To this the magiftratc con
sented, on condition that one of the Police Offi

upon, and they returned to Store-ltreet.
The next morning the parties came ag?in

Calculations of the quantum of human misery
occajioned ly the <war.
Died by ficknefsand the sword 2,000,000 ! !
Each of these unhappy person s
had, upon a moderate calcula- Â«
tion, four persons relative to
him, and either dependent on
him for fnpport, or deriving
comfort or confutation from
him.
The number of human beings
rendered miserable by the death
of these two millions will a -
mount to 8,000,000 ! !
Of the two millions we may fair
ly suppose. that one in four

and widows 500,000 I 1
Nor is this all: upon tbofe who have nei
ther loft relative nor friend by the war, the
load of misery imposed will not be found to
small. We will confine our remarks to En
gland alone, requefling our readers to recol
lect, that all other countris engaged in the
war have fufTered, at least an equal propor
tion. We have added by the wat too milli
ons to our debt, and five millions a year to
our taxes. The necessaries of life are at
least increased one third ; for example, a poor
man, with his wile and fi/e children, who
earns fifteen shillings a week, can now pur
chase about as much as he eould for 10s be
fore the war. Thus he is forced to maintain
seven persons at one (hilling and five pence
per week) We purposely leave out of our
calculation the manner in which our liberties
.have fuffered and been curtailed during the
war, though we are not uimindful that every
particular that is taken from our liberties is
is so much taken from the dignity as well as
the happiness of men, [Cam. paper.~\

The P.!(hop of Rochellcr jullly remarks,
that Parlfament ought not to have been term
ed the. People's Parliament. While the fub
(lance of the Conllitution has been gradually
impaired, and the fpiiit has been withdrawn
from the lifelcfs forms, the technical language
which (tiles the Parliament his Mnjefty'sPar
liarnent, speaks a melancholy truth, that the
different branches of the Conllitution are in
reality swallowed up in one, and that Parlia
ment is nothing mora than a minilteiial engine
to perform the ungracious talk of laying bur
dens upon the people.
It used to be said in Holland of a man
who failed in bufineft, that â¢' he had not kept
tiue accounts." If bankruptcy be uaturally
connefled with falfe or partial accounts, we
can fcaÂ»cely be surprised at the present (late
of public credit, since it has been the uni
form system of ministers to squander without
attention to r our resources, and the pra&ice
of Parliament to vote supplies without con
trouling the public expend.it nre.
The philÂ«fopher's (tone, so much fought

Louis XVIII, it appears, exercises his

At the late meeting of the Livery of London at

Mr. Alderman Combe then advanced, and
heartily thanked his coriflituents for the ho
norable notice they had taken of him. The
condutt which they so kindly applauded, was
no more than he had promised at the time
that he solicited their tavor. It was always
his opiuion, that public situations were only
dcfirable, in order to give greater support to
private principles, as they publicly unfolded
the private man. On this opinion, and on
these principles he had hitherto aÂ£ted, and
could sincerely allure them he would always
aft.
He congratulated them on the circumilan
cesof being now aflerrAled, notwithstand
ing the opposition n*.tde to it by their Chief
MagHlrate, whose coaduft on the occaGon'it
was not easy to explain, nor to divest of the
charge of partiality and influence. His lord
ship's own explanation was by no means fatis
faftorv. It was plain, that it was not prin
ciple which induced him to consult the Cumt
of Common Council onthe present occalion ;
as he did not think it neneflfary to do soon a
former occasion exadtly similar. He advised
his fellow citizens to be firm in the mainte
nance of the fame principles and spirit they
had roanifclled on ibis. An attempt, however,
to prevent the people of this country from as
sembling to consult oh the redress of their
grievances, and a parallel attempt to enforce
the fame prohibition upon them had .fortu
nately failed. They mud be warned by the
experience they have had. In proportion as
they loft their vigour, they felt more ftioilg
the hand of'calamitj ; in proportion as they
loft their independence, the more severely did
they feel the iron hand of opprÂ«ffion. He
concluded with thanks and that
whenever they weie pleased to inllruÂ£l him, he
should be always ready to obey their com
mands.

the Levee at St. James's claimed his heredi
tar) right of advising the crowo, and had a
private audience of his majelly, before the
council commenced for near twenty minutes.
The noble earl with the patriotis loyalty
and zeal that in days of yore charafteiifed
the Howards,laid before his rmjefty a faithful
pi&ure of the dillreifts of his people ; the
alarming .'late of public credit ; the injury
banishing specie mull do to the trade and ;
commerce and coufequently to the rcvenne of :
the country ; the discontent of the people at '
the incrcafed burthens and diminilhed means
of fuppori ing them, and at the abridgement
of their liberties, and the plan in meditation,
of governing by â¢* a vigor baynnd the law," j
âby military force ; the precarious (late of i
Ireland ; the peceflity of peace, and theim- |
probability that the present miniller can
conclude one. The general (late ofthe nation
was very ably described by his, lordship, and
he concluded by declaring, that the tran
quility and welfare <sf the country, the se
curity ofthe British throne, the fafety of his
majedy's family, required an inflant change
of men and measures. His lordfljip said the
only motive for his conduft was his affe&ion
for hit king and country ; he was attached
to no patty, and he had no other agvantage
to expefl from a change, than that which
would be common to every man of property,
namelyâthe security of that property and
the peace of the nation.
With fatisfaflion we add, that the king
listened with a willing ear to lord Suffolk's
admonitions. He owned he was sensible of
the situation of affairs ; that " something
rnuft be done j" and after thanking his
lordship for bis advice, and exprefling how
well fatisfied he was of the purity of his in
tentions, the conference ceased.
The Eail of Oxford also attended the
Levee yeflerday.
Yesterday a small open boat only about 15
feet long arrived at. Dover, navigated by
three English prisoners who made their escape
from France without a single fail, and having
only three oars. By this conveyance we
have received a tonfir,-nation of an embargo
having been laid in the French ports ; and
we understand it is for two months.
We have been so fortunate as to get by
the fame conveyance the Paris Journals up
to the 24th infh from which we hawe made
some interefiing extra&s.

He Rated that an account had been received
there ofthe island of Corsica being in a (late

the British flag was flying, and invitations
had been made for us to take pwfftflion of the

who had gone to France to solicit a force to

.The situation of the Spanish sailors on

Failure of the Porto Rico Expe

KxtraA of a letter from Croix, Hated May 7.
" An expedition of magnitude was formed

british admiral and general from Martinique.â

some frigates, and a great many iranfportj and small

Sunday morning, after leaving-behiud their artil- j
lery, ammunition, proviiions, baggage, See. &c. I
T his retreat was fuddun and unexpected, and has
disappointed many.
T he failure of tht3 expedition cannot be ex
plained fatisfadlorily, but I believe it was occa
fi:>ntd by defective intelligence refpeiling the
strength of the fertifications and a want of
troops, as they took with then) scarcely 3000
men. The English
wounded, and as many more by desertion. The
Spaniards had 500 men killed in the different
engagements. This buflnefs has been badly
conduced on the part of the Englilh.
St. Croix, May 7, '97.
The President by nominating John Quincy
Adams, Esq. to be minider t<Â» Berlin, has
merely exprefled an opinion that hiÂ« services
will be more ufeful there, than at Lisbon
The transfer of (ituation will iiidisputably be
attended with perlonal inconvenience to Mr.
Adams, and will be attended with no in
creale of emolumentâhow gross is the
fijggeliion in Bache's paper, which attributes
this aft to personal confuierations !
At the late Eleftion of Members of the
American Philosophical Society, held at Phi
ladelphia, the following persons were duly
chosen ; viz.
John Heckewi!der,of Bethlehem, Pennsyl
vania.
John Stewart, of Green-briar County,
Virginia.
Samuel Blair, d d. of Philadelphia.
Thomas Pi.-.ckney, of South Carolina, late
Minider Plenipotentiary from the United
States, to Great Britain.
We hear, that a eertain J. Lamberton, a
noted Democratic Member of the State Le
gislature, vÂ»as tried for, and convidledof for
gery, by a druck jury, at the Court held at
Carlisle the week before lad.
In the Senate, on Wednesday lad, as is u
sual, a committee was appointed to draft an
answer to the President's speech to both hou -
fes. The committee confided of Me(T. Tra
cey, Sedgwick and Livermore. They re
ported an answer on Friday, which under,
went some discussion ; was recommitted, and
two members (Meflrs. Henry and Taze
added to the committee. The Senate
met on Saturday to receive thefecond report
which was made a little before two o'clock ;
and after being read, was, on motion of the
chairman, ordered tolie on the table till Mon
diy.
Arrived, schooner President, Robert Lil
libridge, mader, 20 days from L'anfe a Veau,
with whom came paffcngers Captains W. M -
Betts and Btirrowes Aborn, of New-York,
by which anival the following information
has been received : that two days previous
to the failing of capt. Lillibtidge, a fchr.
from Baltimore, , Street, supercar
go, bound to Petit puave, was captured by
a French barge, & brought into Petit Trou ;
that on the 27th ult. Mole H'ad beating
N- E. distant 8 leagues, spoke the fch'.oner
Farnham, from Philadelphia, bound to Petit
Guaveâ(he had the preceding evening bren
boarded by his Britannick Majdly's. cutter
the Penelope, and ordered to the Mole ; the
Penelope conduced her under the guns wf ihe
fort, and dood off; but having left onlvone
of her nten on board, the captain of the,
Farnham took the advantage of the night,
resumed his command and proceeded on his
voyage. . At 5, P. M. Capcain Lillibiidge
was boarded'by the captain of the Penelope,
who treated him with civility, and after ex
amining his-papers, permitted him to proceed
en his passage, having informed him that an
English frigate- had, the week before, given
chace to the Hermione French frigate, and
that ihe had been rui* alhore near Jean _Ra
bel and blown up. At 6, P. M. fame day,
capt. L. was Sled upon, brought to and
boarded by anofficerfromthe letterof marqut
(loop Mermaid, W. Thornbuiy com
mander, from Jamaica, bound to Halifax ;
after the usual examination of papers, &c
was again permitted to proceed. The day
following, being dill in company with the
Mermaid, received a second (hot from her,
, and was ordered to drop under her dern, and
follow her ; upon capt. L. representing to
capt. Thornton that he was deditute of wood
and that he wiflied to anchor under the lee
of HeÃeauga, to get a supply, he was per
mitted to haul up under the land'for that
purpose, and the President and Mermaid were
both brought to anchor at Meridian. Capt.
Thornton detained capt. L. till the next day
when he sent his boat with a number of arm
ed men, took poffeilion of the President, and
Ivith drawn cutlafics drove capt. L. and his
paflengeis and crew into the boat, took them
on board the Mermaid, and confined part of
the crew in irons ; he then manned.the Pre
sident with two white men and five negroes,
and ordered her to follow him to Bermuda,
for legal adjudication, atid that merely be
caule Ihe was from a French port. Captain
L. was returned back to own veflcl, previ
ous to her failing, to aflill in carrying her in,
and captain Abotn and Betts were also per
mitted, a few days after to go on board.â
On the paflage captain T. repeatedly fired
upon capt. L. and when the sea was run
ning very high, frequently laid the Mermaid
close along fide the President, and also a
thwart bows, which very much endangered
the fafety of both vessels. The day of their
arrival in the latitude of Bermuda, Captain
T. bore away in chace of an America* brig,
when capt, L. and his pafTer.gers retook the
Prcfident, and altered her deftl'i gtion. Cap
tain L. unwilling to believe the ridiculous
and brutal conduct of capt. T. could have
been diflated by his government, concludes
liim to be either a madman or a fool. One
of the crew fiom the letter of raatque ilia:
captured the Prcfidwif, and wan-put on board
is by birth Â»n Ameiican, from Ea!l Hsd
!am, Connedlicut, and cairiis with him a
ccrtifi ate of the famij, from ' lie collcdlor of
Cnaiiedon, Isaac Holmes, dated 29th Oflo
ber, 1796, his name is Nathan Dickinfor,
and had the impudence to declare that he
would swear capt % L. diddeUzie to him, that
all his cargu was French property âThe
prize mailer, Samuel Welsh of Barbadoes
declared the fame. It it almost unnectffary
to add, that all the fchooneri cargo belongs
to three Americans.
Capt. L. alfa inform?, that the Republi
cans were advancing in force again!!; the Bri
tish pods in the Bite of Leogar.e ; that Ge
neral Rigatid had marched to attack Jeremie,
aRd its dependencies, with 8000 men ; that
General Tonflaint, with an army of ?0,000
men, had inverted Port-au-Piinca, had carri
ed some ef the out pods and killed and ta
ken 1000 of the enemy ; and that General
Buveau, who had lately met a feme repulse,
was Hill carrying on his operations againfl
the block-house between Poit-su Piince and
I-ieogaue, with a very refpedfable foree.
Capt. L. likewise adds, that the French
barges continue to capture every American
vessel that falls in their way, and whether
their destination be to or from English or.
French ports, is quite immaterial, as these
plundering vagabonds invariably swear the
former. The very few who may arrive fife
in their ports find even there the fame
plundering system pursued by the ad
mini!trators, who from them what
ever their own pcrfonal convenience or the
exigence of the republic may require, pro
miiing at the fame time, immediate payment
âbut those promises arc, in general, disre
garded, nor has any payment been obtained!
but by the moll painful facrificeof property,
by giving most exorbitant fees to induce them
to make good their engagements.
