capacity ; to which, by the laws sf the land, all tbÂ«
joint as well as separate property of the said Gen'le
men, is, and ought to be, liable. And whereat
it is clearly and fatisfa&orily ascertained, that mr.
Blair M'Cienachan, of the laid firm, has conveyed,
away tÂ« nar. John ?/. Huflon, hii fou-in law, to hi*
daughter, miss M'Clenachan, and to his son, George

as well as eonfidcrable personal property, in the city

elsewhere, with a view, as it is apprehended, to de

This is, therefore, to forewarn all persons whenso
ever, againlt the purchase from the said grantees, or

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE caption introduced intÂ« the public prints,
warning all persons againlt purchasing from the
grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
1 large, real and petfonal eliatcs he conveyed away to
1 his fon-in law and to his children was the result of
a deliberation had upon thefubjeft by a general and
. numerous meeting of the erwlltors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P Moore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu*
tion of that trust confided in the fubferibers bf
those creditors ! a step which it would have been a
, breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
1 The very ftatcoient of the fadt therefore rauft dif
| pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
. or vindiÂ£Hve." It originated in a defile to secure
; the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
â¢ mentof his just debts. It was fan&ioned by the
; advice of council as a measure mcejary to the fafety
i of the crfcditors. If (he advertisement has been
: i injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
: ito his own unjuftiiiable eonduiS, not to the sub
, fctibers who have merely published the truth in
terms as mild as the fadi would admit, and vvhÂ»
mean to investigate in a high court of justice the
validity of those purcbafes of whieh Mr. M'Cle
nachan so confidently speaks.
The fubferibers therefore are bound by a sense,
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
caution againlt purehafing of tbofe grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
purchase from'any other persons (if such there be)
to wkom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
conveyances.

\_Dekatc on the Militia Bill continued
Monday, December 19.
Mr. Baldwin was id favor of striking out the
feftion ; but if gentlemen thought it was deciding
upon an important principle too hastily, he had no
ebjedtion to its lying over for the present. "it might
be recolledted that this was one of the firtt great
objedts which engaged the attention of the present
government ; it was then discussed very fully, and
a long and intelligent report had been made on the
fubjedt from the military department. It was at
that time thought best not to decide hastily ; but
to lay'the plan befpre the people that the public
opinion of the system might be ascertained. He
thought that opinion now fully appeared to be a
gainst the measure ; they seemed to think the plan
would be a laborious,expenfive operation, not worth
pursuing. He thefabjedt warnow called
up to fee whether they were prepared to determine
upon the principle. He acknowledged that he was
ready to vote against it; if other gentkmen were
not, the fnbjeft might be postponed. He believed
the plan not worth pursuing, and that some other
plan, perhaps the old one, might be so improved
as to atrfwer the end in view. He understood the
mover meant the house to determine only upon the
principle ; he should vote for striking oat the "firft
fe&ion for the reasons he had given.
Mr. Rutherford said that thegentleman who had
gone before him, had so narrowed the ground he
meant to have taken, that he had little left to fay.
He believed the government, of the United States
had nothing to do with the militia of .the individual
foveteign Hates ; this was the opinion of nine
tenths of the people. The condiiution was ex
press, it fays : when the militia is called in'oa&wal
service, they shall be under the dire&ion of
the general government. But, until that take
place, the different dates have the command of their
own childrenâtheir own families. If, said he, the
United States, continue to grasp and go so far,
they will defeat the end in view ; for, said he, as
soon as individual states arc told they are unequal
to their own business, all is over. For if a farmer,
said he, obtrudes his authority over his foil, after
he has entered upon a farm 011 his own account, and
fruftrates all his plans, no good, but probably much
ill, will arise fiom this officionfnefs. So it is, said
he, betwixt the Union and her children, the states.
With refpedt to the diftridt he represented, they
wanted no new regulations as to their militia laws.
The law proposed, indeed, would go to cross out
all the exertions of the individual states ; and he
hoped nothing farther would be done in t' at house
on the fubjeft, than to recommend it to the several
states to revise their militia laws, and to put their
militia in the heft possible state of defencc.
Mr. Sitgreaves differed in opinion wi'ih the jentle
man from Ge6rgia ( Mr. Baldwin) that lhe business
might be postponed without inconvenience. He hop
ed the decision would not he delayed. He had his
doubts on the ftrbjed ; but it was defirible that a de
termination should be had, beCause those Hates which
considered their systems as defe&ive, waited to fee
what Congress would do. He knew this was particu
larly the ease withrefpeft to the state of Pennsylvania,
and therefore he wiflied the fubjedt to hive an end.
Understanding, however, that this plan had undergone
, much consideration, and was not likely to be fuccefs
ful, he should not fay any thing more on the fubjeft.
Mi. Harper said he wished noi unneceffarilv to pro
tradl the bulinefs, but he did not think' it fhn'uld be so
lightly difpeneed with. It had been the labour of two
committees in two successive feffiens, which confided
of men well versed in military concerns,&who had seen
the defers of; the present system ; he thought, there
fore, that a hill which had been formed with so much
labour and attention, ought not to be kicked out of the
house with so little ceremony. He wished gentlemen
to fay what they wowld â  give them in exchange for
this bill. It waseafy to make objedlions, but a fubfti
twte should be offered. Mr. H. again condemned the
present system. The gentleman from Georgia had
said the public voice was against this measure. He
wished to know how this had been tolledted ? the pub
lic voice, as far as he had heard it, ( and he had had
an opportunity of.hearing.it from one end of the con
tinent to th'e other ) was dire&ly the contrary âfor
all seemed to condemn the present system.
The Gentleman from Ne\v-Jerfey (Mr.<lend<frfon)
had complained that is would throw the military bur
den unequally upon the citizens He believed the
contrary would be the cafe, as every man in the course
of his life would be called upou to perform his ftiare
of service. That gentleman had spoken of certain
persons being exempted from service. The bill con
tained no such exemption ; nothing but inability
couid exempt a man from service. The age fixed up
on was a period of life before men generally enter
ed into business ; and everyone passing through this
military discipline, would diffufe military habits and
discipline through the union, and form a nation of sold
iers ready to defend theircountry whenever it 6 necessi
ty should call them. Not, he said, that the rich man
should be exempted, but that all men, without excep
tion, should be equally liable. So that every citizen
would become a soldier, without which a free govern
ment could not be fspported.
It had been said, if this bill were to pass, it
would derange all the present military eftabliftiment.
It would do no such thing, but would be engrafted
upon it. They were also told that volunteer corps
had equipped themselves at great expence. This
( he did not approve, because the public defence,
which should be general, fell upon volunteer corps
who might be more rich or more patriotie than
1 others. He hoped, therefore, the motion to strike
out would not pass. ,
Mr. W. Lyman observed that the gentleman
who condemned the present system in toto, allow
ed that it was pradticabl* in some parts of the uni
on, so that it could net be quite fobad as he repre
sented it. JHe believed it was capablc of improve
ment. The greatest objedlion to the system now
in force was, that it did not fall equally upon all
classes; il an improvement was made in it,' in this
refpeft, one of the greatest obje&iens to it would
be removed. In every free nation, the citizens
must be ready to defend their country when in dan
ger from attacks from without, or diftur'oances from
within j but if the principle of a fcletS corps ,was
introdueed, you introduce a diftindt principle, which
wii! war against the other part* of the system. In
a military point of view, it was impcllible he laid,
to carry tliis principle into operation, for the mo
ment you introduce it, you will have no other corpi.
He differed from -the gentlenian from S. Carolina
(Mr. Harper) ih speaking of the opinion of the
people on the bill proposed ; he believed they were
wholly diffatisfisd witiyit. Before this bill was re
committed, he would propose amendments to other
parts of it. ,
Mr. Hartley faijl there were several new mem
bers in the had not beeo prtfent at the
former dificuffions of thisfubjedfc ; and he thought
it best not to hurry the bufiÃefs, but to give a little
time for these gentlemen to make themselves ac
quainted with thi fubjedl. If they now agreed to
strike oat the firft fedlion, it would put an end to
the plan proposed. He believed the feledt corps
proposed was not a new thing ; there was such an
establishment in Switzerland, and such a corps had
frequently been under consideration in the date of
Pcnnfylvania ; but the .greatest objection to it was,
the great number of confcientkias. people in that
date irho refufe to bear arms. The people of the
| Eastern dates, he fair], were araied befote this go
vernment was eredted ; but this was not the cafe in
; Pennsylvania and in the South This feleft corps,
he said, ilverc to be anne<Tat the public expence }if
! this difficulty wasgot over, he thought there would
be few left. He suggested the propriety of the
committee's riling, in order to give time for consi
deration of the fubjedt. For his own part, he
should vote for it.
Mr. Gilbert hoped the committee would rife ;
for he believed this fubjedt had not been discussed
daring this csngrefs, and many members were, of
course, unacquainted with the business.
The motion for the committee's rising was pot
and carried 37 to 31.
Mr. Livingflon said that there had been a com
mittee appointed last session on the fubjedl of im-.
proving the penal"code ; but for want of some ne
ceffiry information, no report had been made.
That information being now arrived, and doubting
not, the house was still desirous of ameliorating the
penal code, he should beg to lay the following re
solution an the table.
" Resolved, that a committee be appointed to en,
quire whcther,any and what alterations are neceffa
ryra the penal laws of the United States, and that
they report by bill or otherwise." Agreed.
Mr. Galiatin presented a petition from Stephen
Moylan, of this city, commissioner of loans, pray
ing for an increase of salary.
Mr. Gallatin obtained leave of absence for ten
days. ,
Mr. A. Foster, from the committee of enrolled
bills, reported that the bill for the more effedtual
promulgation of the laws of the United States, was
truly enrolled, and it received the signature of the
speaker accordingly.
Mr. Harper enquired if it would he in order; to
move that the committee of the whole be difcharg
cd from a farther consideration of the militia bill ;
and, on being informed it was in order,, he moved
that it be so* thw purpose of recommit
ting it to a feleS; committee. His ohjedt was that
the bill might, be so modified as to ltand a better
chance of passing ; because if this was not done,
and feftion was determined to be struck
out, the plan would be loft, which he thought of
great importance.
After fable obje&ions urged against the motion
by Mr. W. Smith, Mr. Hartley, Mr. W. Lyman,
Mr. Kiteheli and Mr. Heath, and 10 favour of it
by Mr. Harper and Mr. Craik, it was put and
loft.
Mr. Heath said, owing to a want of fufficient
energy in the revenue laws of the United States,
conhderable films of money had been loft by reve
nue officers, as was feCn by the report from the
treasury department. He thought it possible for
the laws to be so amended as to prevent fiinilar de
falcations in future. For that purpose he wifiied
the following refoltition to lie on the table:
" Resolved, that a committee be appointed to
enquire whether any and what alterations ire necef
firy to enfoicc the payment of money due from
shevarioL-t revenue.cffiÂ«sis of the United States."
Agreed. Adjourned.
Mr. H'Hliamt's obfcrvaiious on the Militia- E * .
Mr. Williams kid, a well regulated militia must
be acknowledged as the best support in a free re
public ; and as every man tfuft be intended in car
tying into effect such a fydem, it became us to pay
every possible attention to this very importp.nt fub
jea. He thought the present fyttem very excep
tionable ; and the one proposed and now under
consideration, appeared to him compulsive; arbitra
ry, and not agreeable to the spirit of a republican
government. The annual encampments would be
very expensive and injurious to morals and industry.
Ihe regiments thus composed would extend over
a great furface, and would want that compad* so
lidity which military corps should possess. In the
bill, all (except those exempted) between 20 and
25 yeats of age, are to do duty. This was -a pe
riod, he fatd, that the ,purcft morals ought to be
inculcated in youth, inilead of which we might
reasonably expect that a greater part of therawJuM
in confequet.ce of their being encamped, imbibe
immoral principles, which would be exceedingly
difficult to remove. Besides, this is a period that
young men take upon themselves an adiive part in
life, ard begin the world for themselves.
As the claufc now flood, the public must be at
a very great expence, such as in our present cir
cuir.fti.nces, we arc unable to "bear. To agree to
the firft claUse would be legislating in the dark, as
it was impoflible to know what number of citizens
there were within that age," ana of course we can
not form an eftimateof the expenees. If such a
system was to take place, he said, we ought to have
been furnifhcd wi.h the number as near as circum
stances would admit. But as a gentleman observed
the other day, that before gentlemen negatived ihc
present mode, they would do well to propose a bet
ter, Mr. W. said, he was of that a le
gionary system would not only preferable to
the one under consideration, but more
ble to the minds of the people ; fully as client,
and would call but for little aid from the public.
A legion, he said, was the moil efficient corps
in every point of ticw. A fele& legion might ea
fily fce fomed from every I rigade of militia, agree
ably to a certain rule of appui uuiiittciu which fhouldi
be fixed by law. Mod brigades could form o>te
troop of horse, one company ot artillery and a lât
----talioti of infaatry. The regiments which compose
jhis brigade of reserved militia lhould be divided

of infantry, matrofles and cavalry. The clafiea
lhould be obliged to furnifh the men for these corps
completely equipped with arms and accoutrement*,
with a military hat or cap, with a coatee, ano a
pair of overalls. The classes which furnifhed these
legionary soldiers to be exempted from the prelent
military regnlstions. They shall be denominated
the Reserved Corps, and (hall ouly meet on die
regimental parade once in tkreo years, to be in.

they might be exempted from all works on the ruad
âfrom all civil duties as jurors, and from pet tonal

make yearly repoits of the legionary corps, 01 the

to the commander in chief of the hate, and to the

good appearance and difcipliitt of the legion, and
therefore e.very legionary adjutant fboulei oe recom.

receive a compensation for less of time.
In older to accompiifh an uniformity in arms, go
vernment might furnifh them, and ctiArge them'to

Rates could furiiifh the legion with arms.
The legion fhouid bear the nam. of the county or

~ The penalties of neii-atteNdance and other offen

system would be efficient, if Jthe fines were ndt giv
(ii to the officers commanding the companies, (or
i their use and equipment, and no fyltem will be so
just as to determine every species of guilt by a court
martial.
The court members (hoold receive the fame fay

mcnt. If would be belt tu arrange a fyflom tor the
*gkÂ»i, ft om the annual reports of the adjutant-ge
neral to the secretary of war, who (hould report
annually the defedts of the law. '
Mr. Williatns said, it appcarsd to him that there
was a certain proportion of out citizens better cal.
eclated and more disposed for military duty than o
ihers. The principles here laid down would give
them an opportunity to distinguish themselves ac
cording to their genius; but in the clause in the
bill before them, all were to be considered as form
ing the militia, let tiieir genius or abilities be ever
so much at variance with the service. Of what use
could it be, said Mr. W. to discipline men who dif
liked the service? In his opinion, itwas only a lofl
of time.
Mr. W. concluded by faying, that he had throwÂ®
these ideas together, and fubmilted them to the
consideration of the house. They appear to hint
to obviate many objrftions which had been urged
against the bill .before tltm, and to remedy exilting
evils. The house would perhaps think differently ;
it 10, they would of conrfe rrjedt them. He fliould
at all events vote for ftrikipg out the firft of
the bill before them.
For the Gazette of the United Sutcs.
Mr. Fbnno,
I HAVE jutt returned from a rational and ele.
R- nt entertainment, in which taiy feelings have been
f- overpowered with enjoyment, that lam impcl
'â¦ to express the delighttuf impreffiens I received,
and which ltill remain upon my miad. I Attended
this evening, with a numerous and refptdtable au
diencej at Mr. Fennell's jfiift " moral, critical, and
entertaining reading," delivered in the Hall of the
University, km til thecommon exprftationof enter
tainment, which nsvelty generally excites ; but
those expeftatfons were so greatly exceeded by the
varied, exquifitc, and refined pleasure, which, with
the reft of the audience, 1 received, in the coutfen. tin* teadiag, and t!i4 talents from which It was
derived, so worthy c f encouragement, that lam
more minute description of the enter
tainment will not be unacceptable to voir readers
wyaurfelf.,
Mr. Fennell opened with n general flcetch, de
scriptive of his plan, and the design Â«f his read
ings, composed in a ftvle perfedtly pure and claifi
cal, and spoken in a manner the most modest and
llnaffuming â¢. in the eourfe of this introdu&ion the
taste was highly gratified, by the equable ealm:iefs,
Slid the chatlc neatness, yvi.th which it wag deliver
ed. N* irregular attempts at fife ornament or
splendor, inte>rupted the temperate, and easy cur
rent Â®f hisaddrefsâ<dl was calm, dignified and en
-B*B' B g*
The fucceedinff entertainment confided of the
recitation of an original poem. containing a few
short quotation!, written by Mr. Fennell with great
. poetical spirit, called, " The Cave of Nature "
in which the different virtuea, vices and pafiions
Â»re painted with uncommon force of colouring.
, Throughout the whole recitation Ilia voice pofTcffed
a fulnefs of .tone, and a sweetness nnd variety of
cadence, which at once aftÂ®ai(fied aÂ»d delighted,
whilst his countenance, accompanied with the mot>
graceful and elegant aAipn, exprefled in the full
force and energy of natu>e the fofrell as well as the
most violent emotions of.the bnman heart. Wlieie
ill was so excellent it is difficult to give a decided
prefeience to any part. The involuntary emotion
which the whole audience dit overed at the descrip
tion of the crimes and the fall ot " Ambiiion,"
father resembled the effect produced by the opera
tion of a real objed, than the flight emotions cx
cited by a mere picture of the fancy. The remaik
â¢ble imprelfioo made by the recitation at this part
of rhe piece would seem to giÂ»e it the preference
by the fan&ian of general opinion ; yet 1 believe
it will hardly be said by any person present that the
defeription and expnffion of Hesitation Guilt, En
*Ji J'oloufy, Revenge and Domcjlic Happiness, were
or could be exceeded. Joy was beautifully and de
lightfully painted j and perhaps in point of poeti
cal composition this part of the poem might claim
the preference. These are the .moll llriking parts
Ot the reading of this evening, bot 'not the molt
important. WhiHt Mr. Fennell exhibited an ele
gant pattern for the orator, aud gratified the man
as taste, the whole piece was fraught with wife
and fei tentious reflexions, equally calculated Vor
the inoraKft and the citizeu.
In retracing the imprefiions which have been
thus left upon my mind, I cannot but icfleft with
that the citizens of Philadelphia, have
so good an opportunity of displaying their taste and
jtidgmerf, by,the encouragement cf an entertain
â lent, HtioÂ«al and pieafing, whilst they contri
bute to their own inflruftion and amufe"-ent. In
point of manner or morality, no o u jecUo:i can be
raif(ja to these entertainments, which, as they are
equally diltant from vice and diffipatiuit, are alike
calculated to please the old and the youno, the
cheerful and the grave. And whilst pantomime,
farce, and the votaries of every kind of diflipatioii,
meet with unbsurioed encouragement, it is 10 be
hoped, that the friends of rational recreation, will 1
not permit the talents of Mr. Fennell to pais unre
warded, in a city which juitly boalli of its science
md it, tact. â  A CITIZEN.

A Marylander can but remark upon the mis. -
rable, but rancorous attempt made in the Aurora
to defame the people of Maryland by abufinjr their
Legislature, because it has uoanimoufly paid an eh
levant compliment to the President. The legif- 'l
latnre of that date gave indulgence to their own 1
virtuous feelings when they thus reprefentcd the b
f'nlibility of their condiments upon the chara&er, b

A LEASE for from yean,from the 25th March next, in that
capital and beautiful FARM, called ,
P R O S P E C T-H ILL, bel
Situated within one quarter of a mile from the Brandy wine H<
Mills, and half a mile from the borough of Wilmington.
THE dwelling -house is built of (lone, two stories ilign,
genteelv finifhed, and contains four handlome rooms on
a floor, besides an entrv, with capital garrets, and convenient _
cellars. It is geneially thought to command the moit a
greeable profpeft of the Delaware, from the source of that
rivet to the Capes. This profpeft 1a greatly ernbellifhed by
a full view of a vast body of meadow, through which the
Chn'ftiana and Brandy wine ereeks are seen winding in beau- I
tiful meanders. Near the house are a Kitchen, a spacious J
stone liable and hay left, a barn, a carnage/house, milk- ,h
house, See. and a well of as pure water as any on the conti
nent. The garden contains an aere and ot land, a- t J,
bounding with fruit, and particularly with peach trees, of j, Q
the very best kind, brought from Maryland, and m full bear- ti(
ing. There iÂ», moreover, on the place, a young, apple t - (
orchard begining t. bear, and several old trees that produce p(
abundantly, besides cherry and other ornamental trees, in
great numbers. The farm cenfifts of near sixty acres of land,
of good quality, and clear of incumbrances, except taxes,
twenty of wineh are now in excellent clover and timothy,
ani ten more will he ready tor lowing next fprins- A ~
fidence of nearly 8 years has convinced the fublcriber that o>.
the filuation is remarkably healthy. The great pod load
from Philadelphia to the Southward runs within seventy fa
yards of the house. In a word, the beauties and convent- tfo
Â«nce of this situation cannot be enumerated in an advertise
ment, and when Examined, will probably command the at
tention of any per (on who is desirous of living at one of the
Oloft elegant country feats on the continent. The purchaser
