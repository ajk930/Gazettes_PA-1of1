Mr. Nicholas expedted that when the
gen tie man from Connecticut (Mr. Allen)
rose to-day, :oftead of giving the Commit
tee new i ft?ncee of passion, instead of mak
ing new attacks* as a.unjud and
tinrealonable, he would have given fume rea
ftrn for the heat which heyc i trday discover
ed. But the committee had received area
fon which went to every of this fort,
which mull be taken as a full apology for his
conduct of yelterJay an.l to day, viz that
jje is d ffcrent'ly formed, from other p.fons ;
that- his passions are not under his t ontrol,
and that therefore he mult not ha expe&ed
to a fwer fur th'm like other men. Hi
should not, therefoie, have taken ahy no
tice of them, had not calumnies bieo i tro..
duced, which would extend s far, aid ii un
noticed, inflidt wounds as deep, as if
fcatteted by a person of a di(Rrrcf)t dtfe'rip
tion.
Mr. N, acknowledged he was never more
adonilbed than he was yesterday at the real
or affedted ind g atijn and anger shewn on
account of the lp:ecli of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, a id which he found by the
fpcech of the ge .tleman from Connecticut
today, was Dartly,intended for himfelf; be
cause he did suppose more moderation or
more.temper could not have been discovered
on a discussion of this kind, on which sub..
jedt it was kmwn, a great division of opini
on exided. The member from Counedticut
charges gentlemen with having'always been
opposed to fcertain mealure- ; and mould he
suppose, then, that such a question would !
be fuffered to pass without notice? - Could
fee suppose gentlemen would fa< rlfice their
Opinions in .Hence? Or could it have been
expedted, that they (hould have come for
ward, and declared that they had heretofore
been always millaken ? At the m :m':nt the
country >as abi-ut to answer for the mif
condudt of its Admisiftratiorr, could gentle
men rationally suppose thi could happen ? If
the gentleman exp-dted absolute and unlimi
ted submission to opinions which other, thiuk
erroneou-), he may despair f ever leeing it.
lie trulted there neÂ»*r would be a fresmap
in the world found, who, though he con
forms to the adt of a majority will jultify it
agaiciTt his own opinion What, Mr N
asked, is the ground of diftereoce 4Â»eti i*t
gentlemen on the present occasion ? Have
we not. said 'tie, concurred with gentlemen
in mcafures of defence, and did we not can-'
*as these meafurts on the ground of utility ?
If any objection was made to the different
meafnres propof-d, it was is to their pro
pritty, Ihe greatness of the expence or the;
ioefficacy of the m afure themselves. And
Js it not pardonable (exclaimed Mr. â¢ ) that
where I fe< a measure propp ed which can
not be ufeful, but which rruft plunge the 1
country in a war,, that I deplore thr conse
quences of ftfch an eve-t, and expref. .my
sentiment. on the occasion ? Upon a revi.-w
of the cotvlufi of gentlemen in this buflnefs,;
it appeared to him till trey dij not wilh
the people to ti nl upon our present fitiraii-l
on ; but to keep up their refei.trieiit andi
.in?tatiÂ»n, and pr pare them for taking aiea
fijjea which thÂ«y themselves seem determin
ed to take. He was sorry to believe this
wÂ»s the cafe, but on hi 3 mind there was no
doubt as to its being so.
Could it have been believed, that after
tjie gentleman from Pcnr.fylvania had enu
merated XÂ° many indanjes, in whieh he said
he (kould deem it an unworthy fubmiffian to
give way, that he fhoulcl have heen imme.
diately afterwards attacked,ptÂ»d charged with
a disposition to furrendar 1 the independev.Ce
of the country ? That gentleman bad been
gro'sly ca umniate-l, and he could net d.f
cover for what, except gentlemen foqr.d
that their own political cou<Ju<ft would not
bear the ted of examination.
Gentktien have said. that the indepen
dence of the country coofifts in refiiting un
just demay.ds; :hat y.nimuft defend your
tommerce agg effioa, or your honor
.an 1 independence are gone M when we
fuffered under the .aggreffiom of another
country, nothing was said of forfe.ting our
lonor and independence if we did not refill.
And would gentlemen fry ibat honor and tn
dependence were ot such a nature that tliey
-vere to bear till the lad moment before they
c >tnplained ? If kc understood any thing
about tfert feeling, itrefifted the firft mroad
noon right, and there was as much left ps
hoftor in fuff.rtng an encroachment to the a

tic. He, as well as the gentleman from
Maflachufettt who followed him, rel ed
much upon the dcrlara ion which he ha 1
made tlÂ«: we cannot effectuaily dtfend our
commerce. Me believed thi to be the
tru h , and though the gentl wan from Maf
fachofetu formally denied it o/i theouifet
of his argumen's, he afterwards feened to
acknowledge it. f Otis said, he decla
red in the mo!t unequivrfc 1 terms that we
are to the pot Â£t>'ou of our ci>m
mei-ce j The gent craan flate'd that t declare
our weaknef-, was to invi e ztggrefiion ; but
he afield what would be the co' f.quence of
holding out protedtion to men whom the go
verrwre .t cannot pote4 ?. Toldo so would
certainly inÂ»ite entcrprizes whi' h would end
in ruin. Gewtlemtn fay no country ever did
compl tely defend their commerce ; but our
argument is, that we cannot de'eod it, so
as to be of any service, and that though we
might attempt it, Great Britain would have
a preference os a count of her fupirior force
a id our trade would fa;l a facraffce to our
attempt.
Upon this fubjedt he was called upon to
defend himself ayainft gre if incoÂ»filtenÂ«v,
and againtl a charge of a lo[s of charaÂ£ter
and national f< elii g from what he felt three

but did not the gentleman fro â > Coniiefticut
fee that it was a mere carrying trade t>-at
was then spoken of. Tiiofc aggressions
which ended lo fatally to this Country had
gone on to a coi'fiderable extent when this
propofitjon was made. The gentleman had
Hated him as faying, that the matter waÂ» not
so much a commercial as a political griev
ance; and the.intention of the m afure then
under confiderattun was to force Gteat Bri

verns him. Ail that was t erÂ» uropof.d
were defenfive operations, and the gentle
man was obliged to have recourse to his own
imagination, to make any thing else o f them
Is l e might be believed, he would declarej he
never did contemplate a situation in wliich
he fhoulihave wilhed to have gone to war
with Gteat Britain, unless she invaded thi.
country.
The gentleman from Connetlicut has ve
ry diredtly cha ged members of thi. Ho'ife,
who adt i i oppi fiti jn to him, with afii g
under the injSueuce of French Jtpl.mâ â ticJitl/,
which the pevfons denonyHaied X and Y, iÂ»
the late difpatchts, have Jpoken of. He was
perfeftly wjiliog that that gentleman (hould
circulate every .opinion of this fort which he
pleaf-d; he was not arratd of thii fort of
caluotiiv ; but he alked that gentleman, Â« hen
he attended to all - the informati tf given by
th<fe agent., he could charge the
i>overtun> nt of France with the wljfcte or it.
Did he suppose that government, or any
ther, would authorize person. to inform the
Ministers afaforeign country, that they were
not adtuatedby principles o; jtidice, a> d that
thc'pr fetit date of ihiags cÂ»Â»uld not 1 tx
illi? H'i<l not inlinuations similar to those
now rodefe by the gentleman from Connedti
cut b en heard in this Houfc almod as oiten
a. gentlemen speak . and was it improbable,
Mr. .N. alked, that men of the defeription
of which these agents appew to be Ih >uld
address theeifclsjes to the fears which they
supposed exitted of 9 fa iious> spirit in this
country? If gfcntlemen in this House are
in what they iayi they have long
hld such an opinion. The gentleman fiom
Connecticut himlell had this morning char
ged every member, differing from him in o
pini n, with a devatedntfs to France. Me
-believed such insinuations, which had for a
long time been condantly made, had in this
cafe been taken advantage of by these agents.
If there exilleda party in this country who
were adtive in furthering the views of
France, wa. it not provable, Mr. N, alked,
that some one per on would, before now,
have been detedted ? I?' any such exilted,
why did not their naneg appear? No such
thing was' fden; and he would confidently
fay, a de eftion of this kind never would be
rratle. He. knew more of the charadtersof
gentlemen alluded to thefe gentlemen
who made the i. limiations knew; and he
was certain that j>o person of his acquaint
ance had carried ori any cor efpondence with
that country since our dispute with i: has
become of a serious natare.
But geothmen lay that those opposed to
them in opinio 1 propose to sub-nit Where
and on what occasion had thi. been propofedf
Do wc not, said Mr. N. ex res ly detlari!

on ? H'-w t en could it be laid that "gen
tlemen wilhed to sub-nit, because they de
clined to go into measures from which the\i
could fee no advantage, bat which would
certainly produce war? if-the gentleman
from Connetlicut does believe, as lÂ»e daes.
that Great Britain is in imminent danger'
and that (he will either be iflvftt!<-d. or mint
ed .by other means, and afterwards'that the
French will go feriouflv to war with this
country, wot it not be good policy to for.
bear exhausting ourfelvesat present ? It ce. j.
tainl? would ; for if we went into the mea
' f* res propo fed,-they would not qnly be-ab
ortive, but mischievous. He did no be
lieve the time " ould ev r come when, thi*
roantry would submit to the will of a for
eign power if ai>y thi g could force us
into fuch-a fiumion, it wtruld be premature
exertion on yond our r^aclu
i ' . ' 4 â 
Mr. N- said he was charged with exprefl"-
inir hopes ef peace.bvinj* yet prefr Â»ed, ,and
that he cwtaii'ly coc.ld ' t believe-i)'the
hopes he txprclT d. IX peruitvly mild seal
low d that before fr r is decbrid a better
tx>, e may be entertained ..with rtTpcA to
peace than afterwards; and he believed that
if we coaid cfc ps a declaration of war until
the war in Europe :* do ed, we might es
cape it altogether. There is a poflibility
tliat war will not be decla ed againll us; be
hoped greater objefts, the brirging about a
general peace, w u dengigethe attention of
the Fren h, take it off from this coun
try. And if 'h>Â» was not only a possible,
but a ' eaforiable course of thingÂ», would it
not bi? wif; to forbtar mtafures of war ? %
thought i would.
But the gentleman from Connedticut has
declared what he expelled from 'hose who
dift-rtd from iro in opinion. Hee*p<Â£led
that whenever a majority pr posed a measure
the rni iority immed ately, and with
out discussion, to agree to it, without a y
tfi.ng being said as to the e'xpedie cy of the
measure pr posed. [Mr. Allen said he had
exprLGly dated that difference of opinion
mull exilt ; but tba the de ifions of a maji
rity ought al ways to be ab ded by] If that
was the gentleman's fxpreffi in, then his cla
mour was made too loon, btcajtfe it was ot
known, "â hilll a qucltion vu ujlde" d fcuf
finn, what was the will of a rruj j lt-jr. Mr.
N, did not believe that whenever that gen
tleman came into a minority that he would
{hew a greater degree of {u million, t* ite
less clamour, or do ltfs to.thwart th â¢ hjea
iures of government th p. he and his si tends
di .
But its was. said gentlemen ought not to
(peak of our means. Was it 'opposed hey
were inixhaullible ? And if they'were not,
would it not be proper to enquire into the
tendency of mcalures before tbey are gone
into ? Noâthis w ill not be allowed, and
whtn gentlemen do it th y are brantfed with
triaf;n, with diabolical intentions, and with
a desire to subjugate this country ta the will
of another!
< The gentleman had all dged against him
that at the lad session, an amendment was
proposed by him (Mr. N.) to the aofwerto
the Pre fide t's address, wljich pledged thb
country to make wat. He believed this was
what the gentleman was ready for, but he
kept his intentions in the back grru d. The
present ^ ?trd
war. If the gentleman thinks the time is
come when we to go to war, why does
he not declare it ? if gentlemen meant to
mak.- war. t ey o ight to bring forward a
proposition Tor at ortte dtclari ~g it, as by
the ronft tution Congress only had the post
er of di.i g this ; but he was so ry to be -v
bliged to believe, that thbbgh gtntlemeti
not ready tor this qitefli'Hi, it \v s thsir
ficfire to produce war in a different way. Ra
ther than a?ree to a measure which would
certa:i,!y lead to war, he thought i HOtild
be mere so' the intereil of the country to
make a positive and unequivocal declaration
of war at once.
The gentleman from MafTachufetts (Mr.
Otis) with an an which is greatly p<-art fed
upon in his bouse (and Which he Was so ry
to fee, because he'did not-wifh hc pb-.ee of

ftatcd that this queflion does not at ail in

given an opinion that this country i- equal tÂ«

N. advised the gentleman to agaia'into

contemplated by the Vice-PreGdent, in the

As ' o the 'ight of convoying our tt'&de,
Mr. N. said, be nevev had denied it. Where
we can declare war, we can conÂ»oy our (hips.

sovereign power of another country cai

, Bit it was said, if France wilhed 'o de
clare war agai d us, she would not wafct
pretexts. r.H that was knojwn on thisheaii
was that France had not yet ihought proper
to declare w?r, and it wa.s to be presumed
(he will not do it. But the gentleman from
Massachusetts cflulJ not that, any
more* than other governments, to te free
from paffians, a' dif we determined to link
iheir vfffcis, and put to death thejr people,
it may pi'' duce a different eifedt.
V Bat all this was said tf) b.e of no corfe

we do not provi It them for ourselves. This
he knew ; and from the belt information he
could get on the fubj dt. he bjicved we
ihou d have to do this, if the mealure con
tempi ted was gone into.
With refpedt td the amount of our exports
to France and Great Britain, it had little to
da with the present queltion. It. was only
introduced to Ihew the probable effedt of or
being (hut out of Frenc 1 porn, in eonfe
quenie of a war. As to the amount of the
ex; ottations from this country to Great
Brit in in the year 1785. no inference could
be drawn from that as to th- pref nt amount 5
because, before the edab ilhmei t of the p Â«-
sent government, Great Britain was'Sdepot
for mod of the Â£tp>:rt d produce of thi.
country : but firice that period, a direct
, trade has been opened to. all the world from
' our own ports.
Thg gentjeroan front MaflackufWtts had
-atfo talked about submission. andfeemedto
suppose that since the publicati n of the late
dispatches, gentlemen were to come forward
| and declare they had heretofore been in error.
; Â£Mr. Otis said, (>c had never any idea that
the dispatches wouid change any opinion of
gentlemen ; he was g ad, however, to find

of g-cr-tletnen t Why are we sent V.ere,
said he, ' if we are not frefly 10 exercise our
opinion? ? If a tyranny was to b< set up
oyer opi .ion ; if attempt, were madAfo in

the people, "he begged gentlemen to banifii
them at once ; for thii tyranny of opinion,
he said, w:t. woeff than fljvcry in chains.â
He w dud gentlemen to consider of what use
this kind of clam ur could be. Have we,
â¢Lid he,' anything but their* Own praiefliom
for the ejccefs of pQtriotiftti W'trich grtitiemen j
tell us and the world they poffirfs ? And
have those who differ from them in opinion,
Ifff reason to l}e attscl.ed to their cuutitry,
they who are continually charging them
with a want ps that.attaclitjient } Do they
believe (they d Hot) that the influence of
another cpjintry ha. fp<ea itfell frow , ope
end of the conii'.ent to another ? Whatever
infl fnce there may have been in this country
in favpur cfJnance, it has been m rely the
influence of sentiment. It could not be sup
posed (he had the power to buy up the ipte
red f a large part ; of the country. The
idea wa. too abftird to be entertained.â
When, fjid Mr. N. we Confefs > e are in
jured b.' that country, asd that if they make
an attack upon u\ we will tlierti to the
lad, what more can gentlemen iviflv? Why,
then, all this clamour ? He feared it was
intended to 11 ake the people ou of doors be
lieve, whar gentlemen themselves did not,
that there was a party in this house counedt
ed with the French Government, and deter
mined on the deflrydtion of their own. '
Mr. N. concluded with an apology for
having taken up the time of the committee
in noticing calumnies which w<re too gross
let. imp*,fed upon the molt credulous ; but
bein,; so often repeated, he thought it ne
cessary thu. to nolice them.
Mr. Dana. Perhaps many geiylemen of
the committee in fpeakingj on this iuhject
have displayed too gi'eat an finthufjaTm.' It
must be admitted that the gentletnan from
Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin) had delivered
his observations with great apparent mode
ration ; yet it might not be ariy'eafir matter
to answer those observations, without (Jmti
ments of indignation. An American, not
very ambitious as to the glory of his country,
may yjt abhor tlje idea of reducing it to'a
state of fubmidion to a fofeign power ; and
when gentlemen propole a course ro be taken
which would abandon our commerce to Ihe
depredations of foreigners, and {hereby de
stroy it, it is natural that an American Ikould
spurn at the idea. And fbr this reason, the
rrtoddration with which gentlemen speak of
measures which would ftaiu our country wrth
infamy, is the thing which excites indigna
tion!
The present question, Mr. t). admitted,
ought to be considered witlicalmnefs and mo-
deration. Irf the View lie meant to take of
the Aibjeft, 'e fhouid endeavour so to confi
3er it- He fhouid have hesitated in speaking
upoo it all, if the whele delegation of Con
ueftkut had aceupied so mut;h time of tliÂ«
hauls this feflion, as live gentleman i'roiu
Pefinfylvania atofie had.dohe.
Mr. 0. referred to the late dispatches of
oiirminiffersin France, as to the opinion-en*
tertained in France relative to our state of
union and capacityof defence. Our incapa
city for defence was drawn from the want of
j> union in our councils, and therefore of the
! ability to call forth our fefodrces. France,
said he, beliÂ«ves (he has a powerful party in
this country, and, in these dispatches, it ap*
pears that her agents have been guilty of a
molt (lander, in fnying, that they
Have even'fupporWrs in Vhi.s house. He wifti
led to repel (he slander; and whililthat coun
try claims every thing, because (he has the
power to claim it ; whitlf Ihe plunders us,
â¢ because >ve are weak ; whilst (he inlults us,
. . because we do not resent the injury, he fhouid
: wish. to convince i'rance and hef ag<nts of .
their folly, and of their ignorance, as to uie
state of this country.
France.is as proud of her diplomatic (kill as
1 of her Â£lory atchieved by asms ; and by what*
i ever means (he has diviJied the people bf this
country, whether by means of money, or by
artful hypothecs in favour of liberty ; Â« U
ther we are their dupes, or their tools pUr
chased with money, 13 of little coiifofldence.
1 This being the opinion i" Francs,* hat
then will bj the effect produced bÂ£ a number
Â»! of gentlemen of thi? house under-akin Â«to op
-1! pole meaf'Â»res of reiiftance against ihe depre
dations of that cpuntrj ? The effect certainly ,
, will be, that the French will conceive their
opinions well foupded, however upright the
conduit of tfrofe gentlemen may be.
! Mr. D. said he Ihould not repeat the ob
: fervations of his colleague on this fabj it;
: but call the attention of the committee to
. the exhibit A. in the late dispatches, which
meations the application ot a lady to General
Pinckney. [Mr. p. read an ex'tatt tfom It

, tfere evidently unwilling the envoys (heuld
leave the country without entering upon an/
negotiation. It was in this view that he
1 considered a declaration that we would not
refill, as an encouragement to them to pro-
I cted in their depredations upon us. And he
> took the liberty of faying, that whatever was
; done here had its effeft in France. He had
I seen the observations of gentlemen opposed to
the mea(ures of adminiflration of tins coun
' try, in the publications of that country. Mr,
â¢ D. read a quotation from a speech of Mr.
1 Nicholas, from one of these publications.
I These exira&s were pubJlftied, he said, to
prove to the people of France, that the peo
ple of this country are difaffe&ed towards
' their government ; and that vie are a dis
contented, divided and contemptible race-
In jullice to the gentleman from Virginia, he
had heard him fay this was not correctly, (IgJ*
1 fd ; ,hut he quoted it to (hew that gentlemen
i ought to bf careful how they dei.ver ienti
ments whiclji may be used so greatly to the
di fad vantage of their country.
When oppofitioa to meaflires of this kind
produced a belief in France that there e*i(ts
a divifiÂ® 1 of opinion as toihejuftice oh'our
cause, if hÂ« were in the (ituationof those gen
tlemen who make this opposition, he Ihouid
feel some repugnance in rejiifting any meaf'ure
which had the defence of the country for its
object. If he flood in so observable a (itua
tion as to be considered the chieftain of a par
! ty, he fhouid feel foms apprehen'fion, howe
ver innocent his views and intentions m ght
be, les he fhouid be suspected of being influ
enced by improper motives. Ifhe flood in
the situation of the gemlenitaii from Pennsyl
vania (Mr. Gallatin) he f.cknowledged his
patriotism would not allowihim to oppufe, at
this time, a measure iutendod for the defence
of-our country. / ? ar be it from him, howe
ver, tO,ceiiftire such a conduct. He would
render-honour to that patriotism which he
owned he did not himfelf peffefs.
The question before tli<j committee, Mr.
D. said, was one of the highest importance ;
for, if it were carried, it would be the means
of annihilating the whole ofour foreign com
merce ; it would deflroy t|ie principal part
ot our revenue ; proltrate our public credit ;
inipoverifb and ruin our merchants ; and
would irretrievably lose the great body of oar
seamen- This was the qutfltiftn ugonwhifh
they were now about ,to decide ; whether
we (hall submit to a complete abandonment of
our.commercial rights; wlvether only our ter
ritorial rights only (hall be protected, or whe
ther our commercial citizens have not a claim
also upon the protection of government ?
Gentlemen fay they are willing to defend our
commerce according to our means. And wliat
said he, are our means? ,We have b- en e^ia.'-
ly pillaged by 311 the world. Gentlemen
will cau(e refpeit to be given to our t
By it. to have tl>Â» honour of being e
qually insulted by all the world. They' fay
they feel for the misfortunes of seamen ; hut
thpy will not doa single thing for their relief.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania refutes
public protection to our veflels, and difallon s
the right of fe;f : defence, for fear our armed
vessels fhouid commit ads which would !-Â»d
to war. He was therefore, for letting things k.
main.Â»s they are ; aridthe prel'ent lituatioa of
things he dignifies by the name of peace. And
is this a peace, fa:d Mr. D. which is valuable i
He had supposed, that a Itate of peace was a
(late in which the rights of nations was u-
and in which the voice ofjufrice'
reigned. But wjtat 13 the peace spoken oft?
the gentleman from Pennsylvania I It is a
ftaic of political purgatory ; a state of cor
ruption and diflrefs, i n which a foreign power
does with us what it pleafrs. The fyflem of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania is peiTedJv
palTlve ; it is as it respects naval matters, a fy
lieni of paflive obedience and non-refifJamce.
But ts this a pence, exclaimed Mr. D. v/ot*
thy the American Republic to cultivate > No
American will fay so.
Our present state, fhegentlftnÂ» n from Penn
sylvania states is not war, and he undertakes
to assert, that to defend our rights againfc
rvoiume xm.lawle(s attacks, is to produce war ; so that JHS
we are never to defend our.property but upon r a
th? principle of war. Has the gentleman to
learn what conftitmes a principle of war > He
fays our authorizing 4 convoys will produce
war. This, Mr. P. said, was a position which
he could not admit. When a declaration of
war is authorized, every treaty is done away,
and it would be lawful to seize Frenchmen,
or French property any where. But would
the authorizing of convoys introduce a state
of war > Because, if once intrqduced, it can.
not be terminated, except by atrtaty of peace.
It oufconvoys produced a war, h would be
such an one as would require no treaty to
terminate it. Were a declaration of war to
take place, a man who went from this coun
try to join the French army, woifld be a trai- j
tor, and a man who corretponded with any
perfpn in France, would be guilty of treason.
These are etfential characters of war. But it
is allumed by one of the jnoft refp-ftable 1
writers on the laws of nations, that defence is
not hostility ; no do mere reprisals amount
to war [Mr. D. read an extraft from
Vattel, in confirmation ot this opinion]. But
it is eviden*,.continued Mr. D. from the uni
versal law of nature, that men may defend
thrfmfelves agaiijtt violent and lawlefsattack. 7 0
This pr.nciple is also warranted by municipal j
law. .
Mr. D. laid, it was not intended that we
should do more than defend ourselves ;it was Set
not contemplated either to authorize reprisals
or captures ; and he called upon gentlemen U n
to state an authority which fays, tha there blet.
exists any r.ght of search, when vessels are ta. Sta
"ken under convoy. The quelHort whether a anc
velfel has enemy's or con'raband property on pj,.
board, was to be determined by some govern
ment; and when a nation takes vellels under
convoy, it is to be supposed they have exa- tw
minsti to fee that there is nothing improper oul
on board ; ahd the true reason why merchant
men are liable to be (earthed, is, that the na- thÂ«
tional government does not fay any thing about
their being laden with goods not liable to be
seized. The matter is, therefore, referred to
the government to whom belongs the cap- _
turing v?flel. W J I
On thf right of neutral Rations to convoy wli
their veirels, there could be 110 doubt. lie (ha
referred to the armed neutrality, and to what I en ,
had been fa d on this head by three different
French mincers in this country. Genet, r
Fauchet and Adet, all complained that we Â®ni
did not arm to protett our trade, an i because tar
we did not do it, they told us we abandoned by
our fights as a neutral fir:
If this amendment took place, Mr. D. ap- an
prehended it would drive 4.0,000 sailors from .
this country, into the service of the British,
or some other foreign pow.er, which would
prove a loss which ought not to be disregarded; pr
as they are a deserving and fuffering set of th
men; But) according to the doctrine ot the v ',,
gentleman from Pennsylvania, if a cargo was
fe zed, the owner, and those concerned, ought
to rejoice that the vttfel was saved; if the
vellel was taken, that the sailors were saved ;
if the fa lors were cast into prison, that they to
were not tortured with thumb-screws ; if St
tortureft with thumb-screws, that they were th
not starved to death ; and if starved to death, tc
that they were relieved from the pains and cfl
trmibles..ot mortality. Indeed, 1<Â« saw no li- .
mits to the fubmidion which he proposes.
He does not, it is true, fay that we ought to t"
submit to an attack on land, and there was ar
good reaion for it. He knows that many of
the citizens of America have arms in their t j,
hands ; that they have been trained to the d|
Â«fe of them, -nd that they want no cotumif-
fion to defend themfeives. He could not lrn
pofe fubm.flioÂ», therefore, upon them.
1 Mr. D. then took a view of the amount of U
our exportsand imports to different countries, d,
in order to ihew the advantage of a convoy Q j
fo> our trade. The late French decree, he
said, (truck at all our Baft-India trade, as no
vellel came from thence without foihe article
of British manufacture on board, and even to '
our vellels bound to the French dominions tl
themfeives. So that that decree will go nearly
' to annihilate the trade of this country.
But it is said, this convoy ought not to be
provided, because the expence of effecting it,
will produce a land-tax ; but if it were consi
dered, that if commerce vcras destroyed, the
landed interest would not be able to pay any
thin" at all, he trulted a eonvov would not be J
objected to on this ground. Especially, when
it is evident that if we do not pay the expence
' of a convoy of ojir own, we shall have to pay
tor one to a foreign country. .
The gentleinin from Pennsylvania, and the
gentleman from Virginia, have both said they i
will not submit. But \vha f does> this declara
tion amount to ? Do they join in any measure
to defend the country ? They do not.
The state of the cafe, said Mr. D. is lhis.
If we will give France a certain sum of mo
ney, then Ihe tvill relinqnifh her piratical ;
practices. The demand is 30 millions of dol- â 
fars for this forbearance. He did not think 1
that France, in this refpeft, (toodupon so good j
a footing as Algiers, because he did not know ,
that the Dey had departed from his agree
ment ; but we have not the fame security
with France.
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania lays
it will be cheaper to submit it* French de
predations, than to undertake our defence ;
he thought, however, ifwe were to submit at
all the tertns which the French themfeives
ottered *ould be much cheaper than thofc of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania. The
French depredations, it was supposed, some
time ago, amounted to fifteen millionsâper
haps equal to four or five millions a year. The
French, on the other hand, propose a loan of
â ,6 millions of dollars, the interest ot which
would be little more than two millions 1 ) and a
nation so famed as the Dutch for adherence
to their engagements would, certainly pay the
â¢ principal. Besides, in the one cafe, we (hould
be at liberty to collect the money in any man
ner we pleased ; whilst. in the other, we mult
submit to be robbed of it by French corsairs.
If the tribute were paid, our merchants would
know upon what to rely; but, in the other
' tafe, the knowledge ot the hazard would be
more oppreflive to our commerce than the.
seizures themfeives. The reply of gentle
men, he supposed, would be, take the least
disadvantageous terms ; but, added he, i
fay I will take neither," and fat down.

THP ADDRBSS _ - J
Of the Young Men of the City of Phila

the Northern Liberties.
Sir.
At a period so interesting to the United
States, permit uts to believe that an Addreft
from the Youth of Philadelphia, anx.ous to
prefeve the Honour a-d Independence ot
their Country, will not be unwelcome
their Chief Magistrate. â¢
Adhiated by the fame Principle* on which
our Forefathers atchieved their Independence
the recent Attempts of a Foreign Power to
derogate from the Dignity and Rights of
our Country, awaken our liveliest SenfibOli
ty, and our'ttrongeli Indignation.
The Executive of the United States, fil
led with a spirit of Friend (hip towards the
whole world, has res rted to every Just and
Honourable Means of c iiciliaring the Af
fections of the French Republic, who have
received their Pr pqfi'tions of Peace with de
! termined Hoftiliry and Contempt ; have
l wounded our National Independence by in
flating its Rtpr: fentatives ; and calumniated
the Honour and Virtue of our Citizens, by
insinuating that we were a Divided, Insub
ordinate People.
' The Youth of the American Nation will
claim some Share of the Difficulty, Danger,
and Glory of its Defence ; and although we
j do not hold ourselves competent to form an
opinion refpefting the Tendency of every.
Measure, yet we have no Htfitation in doÂ»
daring, that wf place the moll entire Con.
fidence in your Wisdom, Integrity, and
PatriotiCm; that we. regard our.Libertf and
Independence Â»& the richest portion given
to us by our Ancestors ; that we perceive v
no difference between the Illegal and Op
prefiive Mea/nres. of one Government and
the InfoUnt Attempts now made to usurp
our Rights by another ; that as our ances
tors have niagnanimoufly refilled the Ens
croachments of the one, we will no less Vi
goroujly oppose the Attacks of the other ;
that at the Call of our Country, we will as
semble with Promptitude, obey the OrderÂ«
' of the Conftitu'.rd Authorities with Alaeri
â¢ ty, and on every Occasion A& with all the
. Exertion of which we are capable } and for
i this we.pledge purfrlvÂ«s to you, to our Coun
try, and to the World.

[* ALEXANDRIA, April 26.
At a meeting of the inhabitants of the toivn of
Alexandria held yjlerday, pursuant to no
d tificatien, the following Resolutions -were a
v g re ed to, and direStd to be forwarded to the
e> Preftdent of the United States,
y Ref'lived, That the profpeiSt of an impen
lt> ding rupttue with the republic of France, is
B . one which is deeply to be deplored ; and
, s that war and all measures of conflict that
lead direfiUy to hostilities with that or any
S) other nation, are only to beÂ»juftified by cau
c. Fes which affeft our national independence,
n . but that when these exist, and are not Ux lb*
ns averted by means of amicable negociation,
[l s arms become the natural, equitable, and
indispensable resort.
a ]j Refolded, That the measures which have
n( j been adopted and pursued by the executive
.; r of the United States, to obtain retribution
for injuries, and to reltore harmony between
, us us and the French republic,' have been tru
iur ly wife and patriotic ; the event having a
bundantly proved, that an the part of France
there exists a corrupt adminiilration, to
whom a further application on the principles
ofjuftice, must continue to be nugatory.
Resolved, That while a hope is chtrifhed
eg , that foms foreign political event may soon
0 f take place, to obviate present appearance!
yÂ» s and diilipate the gloom of war, it is expe
dient nevertheless, for the government of

THE MANAGERS
j Of the Theatre deserve much credit fcjr
the honourable and splendid manner j'n which
.ihfji: received SVtClÂ«ftrevening, and
the performers certainlyexerted their several
talents in the parts allotted to them' with
uncommon ability. The interlude was ele
gant, suitable to the occasion and truly A
merican. Although I am "not a friend to
Stage Dancing, I was highly gratified with
the novel, graceful and aftiye. exhibition of
Mr. and Mrs. Byrne. But the audience !
no man whpwas not there can .bavcan. idea
of the loud bursting enthusiasm, the heart
felt rapture with which they received their
refpe&ed President, and the constant ftiouts 1
and huzzas which rung through the house
in honour of him through the whole even
ing. The National Songs met with un
bounded applause " Firmâunitedâlet us
be" was the universal feriiiment ; and this
chorus was j'oined in. by the andienee with
general enthjufiafm and great effeft. If t \
hated Bache and some cthen eyen more than j
they hate their country and government, I f
could not wilh them a greater punishment,
than to have obliged them to have been at
the Theatre last avening, andjto have \yitnef
fed the joyful return of American feeli'ngs
and sentiments ; and the entire.banilhment
of those, execrahle French murder fho'uts
which once disgraced our p'aces of public,a r
mufement. In the course of the night,
which was remarkrbly mild and serene, ' a
great number .of gentlemen,

The fpirit'of America is arousedâLet its
enemies beware.
A correspondent observes, that it certain
ly is difgraceful that no efforts have yet been
made to repair the Germantown roads, which
were so extremely cut during the winter,
a? even now to be very disagreeable, when
you have to turn out ; besides which, thsre |
are several holes that are very dangerous.â i
There certainly must be some radical defeft i
in the law, or great negleA in the fupervi- ;
for.âHad the ruts been levelled and the i
holes filled up during the dry weather, we >
(hould have probably had a tolerable road |"
during the summer ; for want of this, every ]
rain of any consequence will, instead of be- [
ing drained off, fill up the ruts, and keep !
the roads continually bad. It is hoped the
supervisor will take the hint.
The printers in the city will oblige by
giving the above a place.
THE LATE MR. SADLER.
On the 20th ult. the remains of Matthi
as Sadler, were attended to St. Paul's
churchyard, by .numerous chitens, his af
fedrionate acquaintance and friends } and
the funeral there, fo'emnized. He was a
member of the common council, and of o
ther refpe&able bodies in this city ; highly
esteemed in his public, as well as privite de
portment. It was in the weflern expedi
tion of 1794, 'Â« when the people willingly j
offered themselves," to protect the dignity
and peace of our national affairs, that Mr.
Sadler caught the beginning of that ill
ness which has now deprived us of him in
the midst of hit days, and which he bore j 1
with a religious firmnefs. He had been
before, of a ftruftute and apparent
ly so healjLful and goodly, as promifcl, in
rhe-vievof human expectation, a lung J Sc.
It can be truly said, he was a candid, intel
ligent, brave man. While his memory wi!J
be valued by all who knew him, thcfe traits
in particular will Jong imprefe our recollec
tion, namely ; hid fidelity in the trust? re
posed in him, of whatever kind ; his abil
ity in his profeffional chara&er as an ar
thitefl; the uncommon exemplary care he
took in inftruftion of his young men;
and the placid obliging temper which en
deared him, as toothers, so pre-eminently
to his own family.

CHARLESTON, April 1798.
Capt. Boardman from Amsterdam draws a
melancholy pidture of the Dutch nation ;
the liberty and equality,, bestowed upon
them by thei r French conquerors, have,
with fraternity added to it, reduced them to
poverty, distress and repentance.. Several of
the principal fupportersand conniversof the
Dutch revolution have been banilhedby the
i French ; who, it seems, like the treason
t kut not the traitors. 1 he Dutch Burghers
j have relinquished their medern title of Ci- j
| toyen, and now address each other as Myn
j heers. The French were getting the Dutch
I troops asfaft as poflible out of Holland and
j replacing them with their own, the number
; of which was already doubled. After drain
j ing Holland of its wealth, by deftroving ifs
! commerce, they have now afleffed their real
eftaSes with a tax of 52 per ceut. and had
also ordered them to get inreadiaefs the rem
nant of their naval force, for French expedi
tions.âCapt. B. fays, that so far from the
Dutch thinking of invading England, tliey
are in constant fear of an Englilh fleet en
tering the Texel, and destroying the few
<hips they have left. \
