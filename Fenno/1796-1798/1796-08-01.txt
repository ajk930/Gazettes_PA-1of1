Friend PLEASANTS.
Except a notice which I onÂ«c wrote of a meet*
Â£:of Friends to be held in Richmond, I do not
irSolleft that ever 1 offered a single sentence of any
kind Â«r nature, for the public print*. Thou mutt (
not therefore expect a welldrefs'd performance from
a plain unambitious man, like thy present corref- j
pondent. Nor can I promise thee friend Pleafants, (
ihat the remarks now offered to thee, will prove
any ways inftruetive. Yet, it being strongly im
prefffd upon my mind that I ought to fay famething (
refpedting a performance which has occasioned some ,
feriwus and deep reflations, it becomes my *boun
fkn <!oÂ»f to do so.
I had barely laid down thy paper which a neigh
bor lent me, and I now write without it, containing
a piece under the signature of an agriculturist,
before forae of the sayings of the wicked forced
themselves upon my recolledtion, viz. " "1 he grcat
" eft rogue often cries rogue firft," the greatest
<< w c "generally throws the firft ltone." For tho' i
lam no politician, nor have ever concerned myfelf 1
with any of the great questions which seem to have |
agitated very many of my neighbours, yet having a
rood deal to do with the busy world, I have been j
under the necessity of hearing many conventions,
* and many disputes on the political questions of the ;
present day. And so far f-om ever difcovcrmg in
. those who are called the friends of governmentâand
the admirets of George Washington, any thing of a
oetfecuting, uncharitable,, or triumphant dtlpoli
tioriâthev have realty appeared to me, to be men
of very different cads. And as to their being ac
five in supporting their caufc, I am aftomined that
any fobcr man like unto the agriculturist
Should assert it ; that is, if the people within his
acquaintance, are any thing like unto thpfe.m and
about this city. The difference between theraft.-
vitY of the two paities hereabouts, is surely, frie.io
t j ie circumstances attending tn"meeting in
this city in April last. But 1 do not fay which
party was in the right. 1 only mean to express
what lay elk upon my mind: viz. that the agri
culturist does not appear to be very accurate, or
very candid. There is another thing which he
ftateth, that doth not appear to me, to be quite just,
and I am sure, his conclusions, are neither gener
ous, nor charitable. He fays, the wri.er of a cer
tain letter passed thro' Alexandria, Dumfries and
Frcderickjburg to Richmond. This to be sure is
true enough ; but will any man believe that three
of the inhabitants of all those towns, are fo
reigners ? But admit affcrtion to be aji undern
ame fa&, what fort of charity mull that man pos
sess, who can insinuate, that all foreigners are ene
mies to a republican government, even admitting
that those of our own country, who are friendly to
the government of the United States, and who are
partial to the abilities and intentions of George
Washington, can with truth and propriety be so
(iigmaiized. In all the towns aforefaid, feefiiles
the vile English and Scotch, there are Irirtimeo,
and I have always understood, that Irilhmen, were
confwlered as found patriots, wheresoever, they
might fojburn, and that whetnoever a c-errimonon
was about to take place, they weiefuretobe found
on the noisy, and popular fide of the quetlion.
There are Frenchmen too ; and Ido not presume
that any man will cou.it the people of that nation
among the Aristocrats, or the' enemies to republi
canism. And as to the Dutchmen, Spaniards,
Jews and Italians, I can hardly suppose, that they
will be thrown into the fca'.e of Antloaracy. At ieart
friend Pleafants, it would be as hard for me to
believe all tfcefe strange things, as it would be to
reconcile such coqjradidtions as that of making the
" flefli and the spirit unite ; ortojoin an unfandtifi
ed brother of the wicked to a fandtified lifter of the
> Godly ones." Nor will I believe, that the agri
culturist intended to fay so. But yet, if he does
not ; pray what did he intend? For it is impofiible
To beiieve, that he meant to fry, that three fifths of
the inhabitant of those tr>wns were English and
Scotch, men so notoriously attached to the Britifb
government, that tfrey would throw the country to
which they are now bound by the ftrongut of all
ties, into anarchy and confufion rather than not have
a chance of bringing us once more, under that go
vernment. Now this fcemeth tome, to be a doc
trine as strange and unaccruntable, as it appear
eth to be unreasonable, and uncharitable. But ne
vertheless it may be soânothing being impofiible
with the Creator of all things.
The agriculturist next fays-i-that he doth
not believe friend Henry, ever used such a wlticifm
as a " Sol-lail'dpolitician." Is the agriculturist
Jo apt to tell untruths himfelf, that he can so readi
ly use the langu?ge of gross contrarii&ion towaids
another? For my part, tho' I heard friend Henry
deliver molt of the fentimcnts in that letter, 1 did
not hear him call any person hy such names, yet 1
verily believe thai he did ; a certain peifon,
S3 he returned from Cougsefs thro' Richmond,
wa: told that he bad been so 'nick-namedânot spe
cially perhaps, but with the delegation generally,
Nuiwithftanding, I am one of those who think that
the letter-writer, was guilty of great imptudence
and indifcretioa, for mentioning, and in such a .var,
the name of any perion, to whom such an appella
tion had been given, but in mentioning the name of
friend Henry, as coming forward denying things
which had been laid of him, I do not thir.k it was
wrong, or improper : became, when fpeakinsr i n
tr.y presence, hefeerr.edto fed as if he though': he
hid been extremely ill treared, in havi. g been re
presented as the Author, or Patron, of principles
and fei-.timtnts which he disproved and despised.
These things seemed to have lain long upon his
mind, and it appeared to me that he took this pub
lic opportunity to dilburthen himfelf. But the
Agriculturist would insinuate that this old ex

From the [New-Tort] Minerva.
Much has been said about the present principal
offi.ers of government, being " fuceeffirs in form to
their preJeceffors." A miserable, clumsy, but ma
licious writer, signing himfelf Paulding, has affei-
ted, that the PrcfiJciit hiinfelf has pronounced ]
them such. ,
Of the men now in office nothing ihall be lani,
except that those who charge them with want ot
talents, piove they are not acquainted with them
and for integrity, indullry, candor and republican
principles, they never had and never will", have their
superiors in office or any where else.
The enemies of the present administration are al
ways attempting comparisons between the present
and the fir ft Secretary of State, with a view to fc
exalt Mr. Jefferfon. In this they are more indus- t
trious tlten fuccefsful. Mr. Jefferfon's true cha-
| rafter is well known, and he has all the praise he
deserves, among his acquaintance, and rnoie than
:he deserves less informed. His reputa-,
j tion as a' man of science is rcfpe&able ; but he is
; found deficient in accuracy and close realoning. v
He, has, at the fame rime, the reputation of c
! matiy things not his oivu. His famous report on j
j weights and mcafures was founded on ideas taken
from a volume of the society of arts and agricul
ture, published in England many yea>-i ago, and
now ia poflefiios of the writer. The idea of ma
king the vibrations of the Pendr,!utn the basis of
weights and measures, was borrowed from that -
book, and the flnxional calculations in that repoit
are the work of a profeffor in our college, and pro

To make thesrfelves, matters of the River. o
It is effcntial that we have Meudoii and the ar- v
tillery there, amounting to 48 pieces of eights and b
spurs. _
The 18 pieces which are in the garden of there- e
utllaiis. 1
The National Treasury to make sure of some of n
the Administrators and those employed. ' e
The communication between all the feÂ£tions is p
important ;of eonfequencethe bridges are to be fe-' n
c\:red by the infurgsnts. Waggons are absolutely &
necessary to diflribute provilionj in abundance in all
quarters. The tyrants thrown down, a thing of
the highest importance, the entry of an/ body d
of troops into Paris is to be prevented. Our brothers 11
the brave defenders of their country, will be invit- t
f<i by,a proclamation, and by commiflioners chosen a
from'the body of the people, and from those brave b
men who (hall contribute in the onset, to yield (
themselves individually and without any leader, in p
the midst of their friends. The cavalry, the hufTirs, :
and the dragons, who lhall range themselves under I
the banners of the people, may dispose of their t
horses, cloathing, arms and equipments to their ]<
own use. The soldiers of the other corps shall have
to their #wn use their cloathing, arms and accoutte
ments, and (hall moreover be indemnified in tne I
fame proportion with the cavalry, &c.
Ali and every of thole brave fellows who (hall J
have contributed to overthrow tyranny, fhaJl be
lodged and maintained among the citizens as in *89.
A peace will forthwith be made, worthy a great
people who punish kings and tyrants. Small re
volutionary armies trill be immediately organised, . 1
who will have the care of provisioning the Â«ity of
Paris ; they will be composed of one third of troops 1
â¢f the line, and the Â«thÂ«r thini lYom the troopa in
the city. 1
It is good to observe that as soon as the tyrants 1
are thrown dowi\,hy the confpitators, it will be t>e- ]
ceffary inltantly to caufean infurre&ion of the peo
pie, which must be general; absolutely general
proper writings will be circulated to rouse the peo- 1
pie ; proper agents will be moreover employed to 1
stir them up, to re.enge themselves upon their ene
mies, who vriH be eSrrfully marked oct to t Â«r.. J
The infurreflional authority must pronounce in
the name of the people, or rather the people them â¢ 1
selves, shall pronounce ths JiflohitlM of every kind i
of authority whatsoever, both military and civil ;
of course every perfou who (hall fa* i>r pretend lhat
he is clothed with any other authority than what t
Â»J;e people (hall graÃt, and who shall attempt to aft i
in confluence thereof, "shall be declared an enemy f
of the people, ?nd dial! be inltantly put to death". ]
It is infinitely effer.tial, it is even the molt import
ant point that fomc such acts should take place ;
the sword mu't be drawn, the L-abbaid must be 1
thrown away. Kcfle&ionÃon the part of the peo* {
pie must be prevented, it is necessary that they should 1
forthwith do some ads which will prevept their re
.ta&'af;. "llTj ' â * >
Iffmme royalists should make any tefiftance, a
column armed with burning torches are to repair in
ftiatly to the place where they n't afTembledâlet
be summoned to furrendertheir arms, or in an ]
intent Jet flames aveuge the liberty and sovereignty 1
of the people. <
AM (iraugsrs, of whatsoever nation they may be, I
are to surrender themselves to a provisional arifit a: 1
the chief place in their refpeÂ£tive fe&ions under I
pain of being instantly put to death wherever found.
AH individuals who shall be armed the
people are equally to be inltantly put to death.
Their fpoilsare to belong to their conquerors
The people shall be immediately and eve?) during
the infurreftion placed in healthy and comfortable
habitations, too long hive they been delayed by
fallacious pronnfes. This operation will be ergaaif
ed by commiflioners chofea from their bosom, and
in wfiom 'hey can confide. ' ]
ft is neeeffary on the firft moment of victory to ,
dispatch the fife and intelligent men to the differ

The hsppieft effects have been experienced from lie
the provifiont which you hc.ve made for repreflinp rm

[of your deliberation ; and your afllduity in invefti- wh

I have the greaieft fa'isfa&ion in observing that
the pressure of thofc difficulties is no,w in a gieat
degree removed. y C .
Gentlemen oflhe Hnvfe of Cummins, arc
I Mull in a more particular manner return you ft n ,
my thanks for the liberal fypplies which you have j, a |
granted to meet the exigencies of the War. While
1 Kgret the extent of those demands, which the o ui
present eircumfhnces necclTnily occasion, it is a j n f
great consolation to me to oblerve the encreafing
resources by ivlith the country is enabled to sup- foai
port them. |j U
Th.le resources are particularly manifelled in the f u |
(late of the different branches of the Revenue, in vV Â«
the continued and progressive ejftention of our Na- j,

the unprovoked aygrtffion of an enemy, whose 0 p
hostility was directed all civil society, but ; s
more particularly against the happy union of order (jy

The nature oftliefyltem intioduced mto France

loyalty and public {pirit will ensure the eontinuance _Â£
of that inion ai d mutual 'confidence between me ab
