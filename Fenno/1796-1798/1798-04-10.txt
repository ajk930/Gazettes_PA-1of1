ing a letter from our envoys. The contents j. th
of this letter seem U have made "a very feri- I Â° l
0./s impression here. The situation in which j C c
our envoys were ftfferid to remain h hng
boded no good to us, but hipeJli/l lived. At j

â¢ in favor of the former meafura, and irtJW j
. that war mull be the confluence of arming t |

: Ihip or jujlice of France we have nothing f,

>r MR. FENNO,
i If the important fubje&s now before ,
iJ the public does not occupy all your pa- i
per, be pleased to insert the following.
I observed in a late paper a String of
as questions relating to the institution and
adminiftratiort of the Pennsylvania Hof
pita! ; addressed to the world by a writer
under the signature of Medicus Studio
ie fus, and I have seen answers to them in
'Â£ another Paper, under the signature of a
re Contributor ; I was much pleased at the
er profpeft of obtaining information on so
d important a fubjeft as the abuses of the
e- managers of that charity and was not a
little disappointed at finding nothing new
)d on it; for Mr. Contributor has not said
at a word more in defence of the Managers
l le than has been all along said by them and
id their friends, and the committees of' the
ot general afiembly who have annually vifit
iw ed it since its foundation, and very little
lo credit can be attached to such partial evi
dence as the parties and their patrons. â
g, But there is another fubjeft on which I
should be glad to have some information,
ile It has been often said and I think I
d have seen it in some of the newspapers
or that doftor Franklin by his will bequeath
ret ed several millions of pounds sterling to
charitable and public uses, among which
el- the Pennsylvania Hospital was ranked as
ie " a legatee to the amount of some thouf
ny ands, fufficient at least to finifli the
>0- building. Now permit me to alk this
re " Mr. Contributor a question or two on this
kc. fubjeft, and let us fee whether he can
! u pick up from reports of committees of
lat afiembly any such trite and thrscd bare
m * answers as he has given (scarcely new
0 f vamped) to Mr. Medicus his questions.
es, I. Pray what was the amount of the le
nd S 3c y bequeathed by doctor Franklin
rÂ»l ta the Pennsylvania Hospital.
,u 11. Why have not the Managers demand
ed and received the money,
m- 111. Why are they continually teazing
the legislature for grants of money to
oil, finifh the building when by a little at
-0 tention to this fund, they might with
un . less trouble get enough of their own for
' the purpose they seem to have at heart.
IV. What authority had the Managers
trly to build the House in the aukward
o j. riianner which Medicus Studiofus re
ied presents it.

From the South-Carolina Stale Gazette.
Vl It is acknowledged on all hands that the

ended friends, it might be said that they are
ifleep ; walking with careless but unconfei
>u's (teps upon the verge yt a.precipice. In T,
"uch cale it might be reafonablv hoped that
he CiMtnd of danger would arouse them to
ipen their eyes, an 4 that they would at once
~ee and (hun the ruin before them. But the th
thing to be lamented is not that we do not fee T
jur danger, but that we fee as though we (aw ;
it not. The found has not gone abroad, is
:chosd round the globe, and is reverberated
un our own llioresâyet it is as " a founding j pi
brafsand a tinckling fymbai while the w
eyes of all Europe are turned upon us with j pi
anxious expettation, we return them a vacant â  I
(tare expreflive of 110 emotion- Knowing the w
injuries that have ad'ailed us, and <Ji(tinctly a
feeing the-danger that threatens us, they are tc
(tonidied at our ftipinenefs and (implicit'/ in
neglecting all the rational means of felt-pre- f t
fervation. EA(*rience lias taught them all
in their turn (aiiAwell may they b. - a(toni(hed )â¢
that we profit nothing by their experience) ft
that 110 national calamity is so great as that ot 0
being overtaken by wardeftitute of eliential c ,
preparation. It might well be presumed, t ]
that if we are too proud or too thoughtless to t ]
avail ourselves of the dear bought experiense â¢]
of other nations, we would fiill not beunwil- n
ling to profit by ourpwnâthat the recollec
tion of misfortunes which many amongst us j.
yet living teftify, would admonilh us irre- v
(iftably to negltil no means necsirary to repel f
fiidden inva(ion.
But so it isâneither our own fufferings nor
the example of others, In part time?, nor the
near approach of imiment danger can rouse j
our spirit or alarm us into preparation. While j
we lee the cloud moving on which bears in
its bosom the thunders destined for our heads, (
we are amusing ourselves with idle specula- (
tions upon its appearance, or admiring the t
splendid colorsiv. liich it reflefls to'the eve. (
So the poet speaks of the (imple lamb defli- (
ned for the (laughterâ
" Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flowery food, j
" And licks the hand just rais'd to (hed his blood." j
Do we not believe that we are tipon the eve 1
of a rupture with France? Let him whochu- (
fes to deceive himfelf, be deceived âbut let ;
him who is asleep open his eyes and-believe. j
The opinion of our cosumidioners in that ,
country is no secret : and indeed, if fymp- ;
toms (trongly marked and hourly" repealed, .
ought ever to evince the reality ,of danger ; it ,
is with us not afubjeft for demanftration, but
of vision and belief. And if invasion does ,
come, where may we expeii't it to fall ? If we (
judge our enemies to be fools, then may we
expetl it will not fall upon us. If we believe
them so infatuated in policy as to prefer to at- (
tack the strongest part instead of the weakest,
to choose a doubtful conflift instead of an easy ,
prey, then may we believe that their views
will be directed to the northern instead of the
southern states. If we can persuade ourselves
that the acquisition of a port near to their
islands, and abundantly convenient for the
war they will wage, will be by them held less -
in estimation than one more remote, less con
venient for purpofe, more difficult to
gain and more doubtful to hold ; then may
CharleftQii dismiss immediate apprehensions.
But let u"s hug no fatal delusion ; let us allure
ourselves in time, that there are too many
powerful and local reasons to admit of a doubt
that Charleflon will be the firft to realize the
war, if a war there should be.
Then is it true, my fellow citizens (for I'
â¢am speaking of that which concerns us all)
that with the profpedt of a war tull in our
view, with a moral certainty that if it comes
it comes firft upon us, and is likely to find us
in a Itate so deltitute of preparation, that the
spirit ot our citizens (capable of every tiling
when well supported and well applied) may
only serve to swell the aggregate of our cala
mityâl fay is it poflible that in this situation,
where all that is dear to us mÂ«y be suddenly
put to hazard, the government is taking 110
concern for us,,and we are taking no mea
sures for ourselves i Of what avail to us will
be pur corps of infantry, cavalry and artille
ry, with the noble ardor that inspires them,
while out harbour is undefended, and our
city liable to the Aiccefsful adault of any na
val force, however inconsiderable i Is it for
us who are every hour exposed, who have e
very thing to dread and little to hopeâis it
for us, I (ay, to imbibe the torpor of the fe
deral government : and because theyfhew no
concern for us, to feel no l'olicitude for our
selves ? Ip the name of all that is dear to us
let us rouse from our lethargyâthe precious
moments of negociation (it not already ended)
ought no longer to be fquar.dercd away in
thoughtless inactivity. Do you ask what I
would do ? I would h,[ft of all lay before Ccfri
grefs, in language that would (limulate their
attention, the grievances under which we la
bourâ For I call it a grievance, when the
whole nation neglects a weak and vulnerable
part, peculiarly exposed to the dangers and
calamities of war. The very basis of our
union is declared to be " to provide tor the
common defence," and I would besiege them
with the voice of complaint and invoke that
copiman fro-vi/ion which has been mod (hame
fully withheld. I would thunder at the gates
of this deeping Congress, in language that
would rouse them to'a sense of our dangers,
and of the protection which we have a right
.to claim from the Uniqn. I would lay them
under the neceflity of either receiving oj re
jecting eur petitionâwe (hall then have dif
' charged our duty to ourselves, and the worst
1 calamity that can b'efal us will have its conso
lation. If after a fruitlefs application on our
part this opulent city Ihould be taken orpil
â  laged, or laid under ruinous contribution, the
justice of the union cannon refufe to (hare
in our calamity, by making us an adequate
J recompense. They ran alledge neither that
, they were ignorant of our danger or unap
pnzed ot our weakness, and (till less can they
' controvert our constitutional right to have
1 had their seasonable proteftion. If the voice
of importunity and remonstrance should fail,
it will then remain for us to consider whether
. private contribution, & that fpeedily,is not to
be preferred to our continuing in a defence
lefs date. And (houfd such a measure be gone
1 into, and events juftify it, the previous ap
. plication to Congress will drengthen ourclaim
upon their jultice and remuneration. Last
ly, let them be told that the legillature of
this date have refilled to provide for the de
fence of the fea-coalt, principally upon the
ground that both the right and the duty ap
pertain to ihe Union,
j My motion therefore is, that a memorial to
Congress be immediately prepared, copies
druck off, perfon appointed (perhaps
the wardens) in each ward 111 the city, toten
j dcr it to the citizens for signature. Let it be
haflcned forward before the feilion draws to
wants a dole that Congress may have timo to
give it that conflderation, and take thut order
upon it, which our fat'ety and the'ir duty will
equally dictate. '
If this proportion be right in point of prin
ciple and expediency, it will be feconJed ;

days ago. _ tl
When captaia V. arrived at the â¢Mole, from tl
Jeremie, a Bfitifh (loop of war waflying there, tv
which failed lor Jamaica the'day after. She (c
was 18 days from Cadiz, charged with dis
patches from admiral Jervis before that place.
t she information-gathered by her arrival was,
that the Spanifli fleet of very superior force,
with 200 fail of merchantmen under convoy, ~
had put to sea ; and as their destination was f
unknown, difpatcheswere sent to the differ- "
ent ports in the Weft Indies, fi?r all (hips of
war to keep themselves 011 the look out. Ad
miral Parker, who was lying at the Mole,
with 7 fail of the line, and several frigates, was
making vigorous preparations for sea.
We have received the following letter from
the ftibfcriber, who requests its publication. r
Gentlemen if the United States of America,
You will think drange of this, I suppose;
but you mufl be on the look out. I afliire you,
there are about thirty French privateers get
ting ready to cruise rauncfthe Capes of Vir
ginia, and round the Northern parts of your j [
: country. lam confined here and cannot get
j away. There is a report here, that no Ame
â ricans (hall be permitted to go to their native
homes until they have further accounts from
America. They are taking your vedels as fad
as they can. They are muflering troops to
r fend awav to all the ifiands. They expect you
will declare war, and fay they are ready for
you. They fay if you embnrgo your vetTels
z "by God they no care." You will hardly be
lieve this true, but you may rely on it for faÂ£l
âI am an American myfelt, and write you
this 3s friendfliip to Amerians.

JL last autumn, led mÂ« to jn invefl igatinn of
ths origin and phenomena of peftilsntial diiialjas
r " in other countries, as well as in the United St tcs.
In the profrcution of tfie fubjcfl:, new fails and
principles continually opened to aiy view, and si ;
raliy determined me to trace back the history of
such difcafes as far Â»s the records,,of hiftpry cu
ff wn< i. For this purpose, I examined the pub
s' lie libraries m New-York, Ncw-Havsn, Cam
'. bridge and Boston, witji, a viaw to obtain a'l the
11 ' material fails which can illuilrate the fubjsifl.antl
t have nearly colleacd all the materials for the J
â¢ nropofod work.
The fails'eollefled will enable me to demon
isÂ» Urate tSiat many of. tEe common Mi-is refpeSihg
pefijlentiaWpidsipies, are. unfounded of cxtremf-
J " ly.hiCOtTea.; in copfeq.ufnce of medical
writers cartfrdering an epidemic disease as a detach
ed cr isolated pl.jnomeuon in a particular coun- j
try ; rather than, as connected with other tpide
r*icj or other phenomena ef nature in various
parts of .the %vorl,d ( The, fafts I have collcifted
a l Lead to certain deduilions whiph are surprising to -
mWeUt api vyill probably be now to many
er others. Much ligKt will be thrown on this dark
ipj and, r> rplexing fubjeil, as well as on natural phi- a
tofophy. i
The proposed work will mtike a full-fized oiJia- j
vo volume ; and execute* well on fine paper, can
n not be afforded at lels than two dollars, bound, -
with the usual allowance to book-fellers. As tha
compilation will coll not only great labor.but con- '
fidcrable expince, 110 more copies will be printed
than to fupnly fubferibers. The book will be rta- 1
5m dy for fubferibers early in the coming summer, and 1
the holders of proposals will be good enough to ]
return them to No. 40, Pine-street, by the firllof
May.
