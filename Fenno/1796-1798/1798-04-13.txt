HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, j
SICK AND DISABLED SEAMEN.
Tuesday, April 10.
The bill for the relief of sick and disabled Sea
men (which provides that every Seaman
belonging to the United States, (hall pay
twenty cents a month out of his wages for
the relief of Sailors in didrtfs, and for the
erettion of hospitals) having been read the
third time, and the quedion on palfing being
put,
MR. SEWAI.L said, he was unwilling to
fay any thing againd this bill ; but
i palling of it would be attended with many in
-1 conveniencies and objection's which ought to
jbe mentioned. He allowed the objections
j principally applied to the |>art of the Union
from whence he came, where provision is al
ready made for sick and disabled persons of
every description, sailors as well as others,
with which every person in the community is
charged. Seamen in that quarter, therefore,
now pay their full proportion of money for
public charity ; and if they were again to be
called upon by this ail, they would be made
to pay in two different ways for the fame ob
ject, without any advantage to themselves,
because they are already entitled to relief in
cafe of sickness or disability. But if this was
not the cafe, he doubted the propriety of tax
ing seamen only for the support of what ought
to be considered as a public charity. He
thought the laws of reason and charity called
upon the public at large in- support of unfor
tunate men of this description, and that the
burden ought notpxclufively to be laid upon
them. We have, said he, no common feeling
with these men; the tax will fall upon no
member of this house, but will be exclusively
drawn from the earnings of a small part of the
community, who, in all probability, will re
ceive 110 advantage from it for fifty years to
come, as large and splendid buildings mud fit It
be ereCled, in order to exhibit to the world a
specimen of Public Charity. Nothing of this
kind was to be seen in hi9part of the cquntry ;
but this clals of persons was nevertheless pro
vided for. Neither native or foreigner was
there sick without care and relief being affor
ded him. It was difficult, therefore, to con
ceive upon what rcafonable ground the sea
men of his State could be called upon to con
tribute to a fund of this kind. The only rea
son which had been alligtied was, that the
New England feamea frequently visited the
Southern States, where if they were taken
sick, there was no provision for their relief.
He hoped those States would provide relief
for such unfortunate persons ; if not, sailors
mud go there as they go into Foreign Coun
tries.
Much reliance, Mr. S. fiid, had been laid
on the example of England, where it was said
timilar edablifhroents exilled. But those eda
blidiments were begun by the grants of indi
viduals, and a particular class ot seamen, those
in the Navy, merely contributed to
their current expencesâ(o that the two cases
were very different. He hoped, therefore, the !
bill would not pass.
Mr. Pinckney wai furry to diffur from j
his friend from Maffuchufetts on this fubjeit.
He had hoped the objections which he had
before dated to the principle of this bill
would, by this time, have been removed.
The gentleman had before dated, that his
principal objection to this bill arose from there
being already provision made in thÂ« Eadern
States for the relief of sick and disabled sea- 1
men. It was then dated in reply, that provi- 1
ded the law did bear a little hard upon that
State, from their known federal disposition, it
was hoped, as it would operate a general be
nefit to the Union, it would not be objected
to. But it was tlrtn (hewn, and he would re- J
peat it, that the law could not bear hard upon
thein. If there is a provision at present made
in Massachusetts for persons of this descripti
on, it mud be a burden upon the people
there ; and if, after the palling of this law,
that burden be removed, it would certainly
be beneficial to the citizens of that State in
general, though it may be a tax upon the sea
men.
The gentleman from Maflachufetts had-alfo
spoken againd the general utility of the mea
sure. He said it was taxing a particular de
scription q/ men for a general ofejeCt : on the
contrary, he thought it only reafonaDle and
equitable that these persons should pay for the
benefit which they were themselves to receive, .
and that it would bÂ« neither just nor fair for i
other persons to pay it. But he believed if a
the subjeCt was farther looked into, it would Â«
be fouwl that thÂ« seamen would oot p?y the
tax themselves, Â»3 it would come to be consi
dered as wages, and by that means become a
. 'general tax ,as the Merchant who would have
â  to pay it, would lay it upon his merchandize.
But the gentleman favs, this tax is to beap
! % jpriated to the building of large and fplen
â¢ did Hospitals. As farashe had conlideredthe
bill, he understood that the erection ofhofpi
tals was only a secondary objeit. Relief to
t distress is the firft thing to be attended to, and
â  l ifafter affording this relief, the tax produces
a fufficient surplus, it is to he employed in the
r erection of suitableânot large and splendidâ
â  buildings, as hospitals.
I The gentleman had also said that the sea
; men ot the Eastern States must rely upon pro
- visions made for them by the Southern States
r in cafe of licknefs, &c. or if no such provisi
on was made, they mud take the fame chance
t as when they go into foreign countries. This
i observation does not apply, ai the United
1 States have made provision for their (Ick ami
disabled feanien in Foreign Countries by
means of Consuls, which. it is contemplated
I to make more efficient than it has heretofore
: been ; but this is not the cafe in the Southern
| States. Seamen who are lick and disabled
. there, have only to rely upon private charity
. for lupport ; and surely the Eastern States,
, which turnilh at lead thÂ«e fifths of the lea
men of the United States, are interested in
. providing some more certain support for their
t unfortunate citizens. All these circumstances
. considered, he trusted the bill would pals.
> Mr. Livingston said, the objections to
this bill had anfen from two sources ; its ine
( quality as to different parts of the Union, and
t its inequality as to the persons upon whom it
was to operate. On the firft point, he thought
, such fatisfailory answers had been given as
mutt have proved effeftual. He was sorry it
had not had that effect ; but notwithflanding
the pertinacious oppolition which this bill
has received from the gentleman last up, he
doubted not it would pass by a large majority.
T he inequality said to arise in its operation in
different parts of the Union, was owing to
provision having already been made in some
states for the relief of lick and disabled sea
men. But how, he alked, would this provi
iion injure that part of the United States ? Did
not the gentleman fee that the Prelident had
the power to appropriate money for the tem
porary relief of seamen, in the firft instance ?
Of course, he would reimburse to the state of
Maflachufetts, or any other state, anv fumsof
money expended for this purpose. The.pro
vision which the gentleman speaks of as being
made for this description of persons, he sup
posed, was the common town charities,which,
if they were to be reimbursed, the inequality
which had been spoken of, would appear to
be'only imaginary. But if the inequality had
existed, when the gentleman had feenthe ex
treme utility of such a provision in other parts
of the Union, he should have hoped he would
have waved his objection.
In the city which he represented, Mr. L.
said, they had also a provision of this kind.
At Charleston, and, he believed at Philadel
phia, similar support was afforded to persons
of this description. In New-York, there were
generally 300 sick and disabled seamen reliev
ed in the course of a year, and he supposed an
equal number might receive support from the
institutions of the two other cities he had men
tioned. Besides, the persons upon whom this
inequality was stated to fall, ought not to
make any violent objection to it, as they were
fhemfelves in the habit of receiving some small
advantages from the Union, 'which ought to
prevent a murmur at a provision like the pre
sent. They receive, (aid he, 76,000 dollars
annually in bounties on their fifiling veflels,
though the duty pn the fait used in curing
their fifh, which this bounty was given to
countervail, does not amount to more than
30,000 dollars. Indeed, he did not believe the
people themselves would object to the tax in
question. If he knew any thingintlie careless,
honest nature of this class of men, they would
not object to so trifling a sum as 20 cents a
month for so valuable an objeift. A sailor,
said he, is concerned only for the present, and
is incapable of thinking of or inattentive to fu
turewelfare; heis therefore a proper object for
the care of government, and whilst he can
provide an asylum for infirmity or old age,
by the facrifices of a few gills of rum, he will
not scruple to do it.
But it was said this benefit could not accrue
to sailors, for a number of years, as magnifi
cent buildings mult be firft eredted. Surely
the gentleman from Maflachufetts did not at
tend to the provifior.s of this bill, or else he
wilhed to produce a falfe impreflion upon the
committee. Nor was it cultomary for the
gentleman to express his doubts about the
Executive misusing any power placed in his
hands.âSurely he could not suppose that the
Trefident would expend the money raised by
virtue of this act for the relief of distress, in
the ereftion of magnificent buildings. For
his own part, he could not believe any such
thingj; he believed the money would be pro
perly applied, and no more be heard of the
iniferies of this class of men. Andifany sur
plus remained, it would be expended in a
frugal way, so as to conduce to the happiness
and comfort of this class of men, and to the
honour of the nation.

CITIZENS,
The Americans of the University of Edin

thin they pitied you; they had no sooner heard
of your wants, than tluy refolvtd to attempt
the alleviation of t-heni-

been converted into the plougnfhare, unaccus
tomed to thÂ»fe ftenes which have been so often
exhibited throughout Europe, their feelings
mud be accute when they he- old the miserable
Condition to which mmy of their fellow crea
tures are reduced by the fate ot'war.
We sympathize with you in your fufferings ;
we fvmoat'nize with all those who are Condemn
ed, riot only to the loss of the gift of nature, their
â liberties, but whose captivity mud be embitter
ed by the policy of natims.
We regret that our situation in a foreign
country, rendered critical by the unhappy dis
turbances which exifl through Europe, prevents
our dil'playing that lihcrality towards you,which
we ihrt'ild olherwife do.
We ardently hope that the small sum our fi
nances has allowed 03 to contribute, will afford
* temporary relief to your immediate wants.
Accept of it, then, and eftccm it as the gi f t
of men who have hearts to feel, and whose v iftt
it will ever be, to relieve the diftrsffes of the#
fellow-creatures.
In this manner we think it incumbent on our
selves to inforip you, and publicly to declare,
tha: the condufl of the gentlemen whom we j
nectffarily consult as to the distribution of this
lubfmption, deferÂ»e3 your thanks and ours, for
the liberality of sentiment they have displayed,
and th.4 ready compliance they gave to our per
forming a duty of humanity.
We sincerely with that a speedy termination
of the war vyhich has existed for several years
in Europe, may rellore you and all who are
placed in a similar situation, to the enjoyment
ofliberty.
And we look forward with pleasure, to the
happy moment when agriculture and commerce
will again aflame their fupcriority, and the din

Gentlemen,
The French prisoners are penetrated with
thÂ« mod lively gratitude for ycu. beneficence.
What pleasure does it afford thera to find men
humane and generous enough to take part in
their misfortune* 1 ....
O ! that I could express the lively sensations
wl.ii h your benevolence has excited among
the r e unfortunate viflims of the fate of war.â
They all 10. k up to you as to a father since you
have in Â« manner reflored them to life. The ir

exp'nerce who relieve the dillrefTes of foffcring
humanity. Receive this tellimony of our full
acknowledgment. It is so lively, that our (acui

ces all hereditary privileges. He concludes
with these words. ' The more lam hated

The inhabitants of the canton of Bade, on
their part, claim liberty as a right which
they hold from God and Natute. " The

The preparations at Toulon, Brest, Dun

with so much aftivity as may prove to our
enemies that the plan of an invasion is not

ambassador to Naples,has not accepted that

of the a.imy of England. A report has
been circulated here, that the Pope by ad
vice of the sacred college, has resigned to
the King of Naples all his temporal autho

1 an address which was read and unanimously
" agreed to. Another committee were ap

f The meeting at Dunwoody's lafl evening
was large and relpeftableâcitizens of ai
med eve y profefllcn attended ; the business
e was conducted with the utmost harmony.â
I But one sentiment appeared to animate eve

a the government, and to support tjie confli

- for the proteftion and defence of the rights
1 and independence of the United Stjtes.
, Many were present, who have heretofore

ble) the oppofers of my sentiments of the
1 fallacy of their own. Six months ago, my
prejudices were so rooted in favor of France,
that the events of the time could work no
s amelioration in my tenets ; the fubfequeant
. exposition of the views of that government
: however, have operated a complete conviace
> merit of my error, and a dereliction of my
, partiality. An acknowledgment of this
: faÂ£i, may perhaps, add to the obligation of
my former colleagues in politics, to liflen to
i the truth: which (as your correspondent
1 Eugenius observes) â¢' will strike conviflior.
- to the king or the peasant" I will add, that
both the lovers of order, and the provokers
1 of anarchy, discover, 'hough the former 011-
, ly, will acknowledge the perception of it.
Without condsmn : ng the sentiments, I
1 have held it is enough that I now grant the
f abfurditv and criminality there would be in
f continuing to profefs and exprels them. I
. would recommend candor, to thofc, who
. like me, have held French principles, be
fore they wade in wickedaefs so far, " as to
return, were tedious as go o'er," for there
r are some of my quondam friends, who are
- determined to prosecute their do&rine, to
s the annihilation of conscience. Not for
- these, but for such as are disposed to attend
- to reason, are my fublequent observations
J designed.
The conduft of France towardsthis coun
i try, has undergone a great transformation ;
s the original oltenfible excuse seems to be,
that by our treaty with Great Britain, we
e have ndt fufficiently maintained our indepen
dence : and tÂ»at we have ftipula'.ed for the
performance of articles, that are inimical to
y the irtterelt, and repugnant to our former
s eompaS with them.
It is not my intention to traverse the beat
-1 en trafl of argument on the treaty with the
i. the former, but permit me'to observe, that,
as fa the predication, that we have rtlin
e quifhed any ; part of our independence,-it
it cannot avail them, luppoling it to be true ;
d since no Ration has a right to complain of
u any treaty, which does not affeft her: If
we had yielded our rights; degraded our
y honor ; if wc had borne with indifference
y the aggrefiions of the English, .and made
no application for rearefs: if our njinifler
had been treated ignominioufly by Britain,
:s ! and we were paflive, the French would have
t- no right to interfere.-
1, In refpeft to the next general objection,
n namely, that by the treaty we have injured
r- them, it would be a good one, if founded
e in fad, for " a nation in fulfilling what it
d owjs to itfelf, is not permitted to forget its
d duties to otbfrs." JBttt let the advocates
n . for this plea, peruse the inflrumeM itfc'.'f,
:d arti le 2Jth, " nothing in this treaty con
t. uined fnall, however, fie construed or ope
-I *, rate contrary to former a id-existing pubbc
1-, treaties with other lovtreigr.s or ftaies." I
