HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.. 11
Wednesday, May 16. '
fContinued from yrjlerday s Gazette. J
Mr. M'Dovvell laid, were his feelings as- *
fected in the manner which those of the' gen- t
11 em an from Mi(Tachufetts,juft fat down, apt
peared to be, he would not have risen. It v
would fee in that the 1011 ml of the din of war
had already reached his ears. He, however, t
felt perfectly unalarnied by the fears which
seemed so greatly to agitate the gentle man. c
When tliis fubjeot was under consideration
the other day, he llated some conftitiitional t
objections to the measure, which he hoped
would have been noticed, but thety had 1161 a
been attended to. Mr. M*D. repeated them.
He admitted that this force would be raised
without expence at firfl ; but if called into
service, it would receive the fame pay as o
thers, and there would be no greater expence -
attending tl\e training any part of the militia r
ireld in requisition], than there would bo in \
trainingthele volunteers'. It had been laid, t
mintia could not be depended upon, and
therefore it was heceflarv to have a regular c
force. If gentlemen really believed tins, lie 8
wished gentlemen would come forward and f
prbpofe a force at once. r
Gentlemen fay these volunteers will furnifh r
a very formidable force. This may be the ,
â¢cafe, but he believed it was very uncertain.
He could not fee why they should be more
formidable Hum the militia. He- believed 1
the militia could learn their discipline as well* 1
and had as much zeal as they for the welfare t
of their country. One of the grcateft induce- t
ments to persons to enter into this corps is, ,
that they are to be employed only in their (
own, or an adjoining state. The gentleman
from Maflachufetts propofws, however to
strike this clause out. If it were struck out, 1
he supposed jt would confine the number of 1
volunteers within a tefs compass than they (
otherwise would have been. But if.gentle- ;
men's views were to go the full length which
they contemplated-, there would be no re
ftrictionas to.the number ofnien to be employ
ed, nor to the extent of the time of admillion,
except the limitation of the law ; and CÂ«n
greis would, in the mean time, have no will <
upon the having delegated the pow
er to the President, contrary to the exjjHefs
provisions of the constitution. He was oppo
icd to this mode of raising troops. He knew
only of two descriptions of soldiers, regulars
and militia, and he looked upon the latter
as the only complete defence of the country.
As to an invasion, which gentlemen seemed ttÂ»
speak of with so much certainty, he thought
it altogether improbable.
Mr. M*D. said, he was not apprehensive of
a want of spirit in the citizens of this country
to defend themselves against any attack.
There are men alive who then fought our
battles, and he doubted not they would be
ready to fight them again, and others would
arise to supply the place of those whom we
have loft.
It was said, these volunteers were not to
confifl of the class of men described by the
gentleman from Pennsylvania. IJe hoped
not. He never wished to fee the rich citizens
separated from the poor in any scheme of de
fence. He believed this would not be the
cafe altogether, because he doubted not a
number of young men, who are not rich,
from a desire to serve their country, \Â«:ll pur
chase their own clothes, arms, See. and join
these corps. Indeed, lie had rather the arms
should be found by government, so that all
might have the fame opportunity of serving.
Mr. M*D. objected to this provision, because
it gave to the President a power not contem
plated by the constitution, of calling out tlre/e
volunteers war or no war, in furred; ion or no
whenever he pleases. These
men would form a regular army, not in this
or that place, but all over the United States.
For what purpose ? Gentlemen fay to repel
invasion ; but he apprehended they were
wanted for another purpose.
Mr. M 'D. granted with the gentleman last
up, that this country is in an alarming litua
tion from without and within ; and as he had
formerly said, whefh he saw real danger, he
should be ready to raifeanarmy, but not be
fore. He wished, however, the g'entleman
from Mafiachufctts to. quiet his tears. The
80,000 militia m requifrtion would be fuffici
ent for the present; and if they were hot,
more might be called. He hoped thfc section
would be struck out. He knew volunteer
corps were valuable men, but he wished them
to stand 011 the lame ground with the militia.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) did not know
how to understand the member from North-
Carolina (Mr. M Dowell) who, when the
militia bill was under consideration, had,
wi h some of his colleagues, reprsfented the
militia of their state unarmed and undis
ciplined, but now, when it better suits his
purpose, he re pre fj? lit.Â« them as in such regu
lar and compleat order, a> to be enabled to
repel any attack upon their country, and to
effect a'l that i 3 poflib'e for regular and well
disciplined troops. That gentleman had de.
cla red his opposition to the railing of
men, until an rftv lion had a&ually taken
place; a declaration, which was molt extra
ordinary and unaccountable, as oming from
ore who had m< re than once informed the
house that he had served in tlie aroiy. No
military man, Mr. D. averred, would delay
his pi epai ations so i re. eivmg and repelling an
enemy that threatened an attack, until they
I had actually made, the ..flsult and there ore
if that gentleman had ever acquired that
knowledge which was to be gained from mi
Ii ary fervic:, he mull certainly have forgot
ten or slept it away, for it was in direst con
tradiction to the plan of procrallination which
he had advocated. Mr. D. said he fhou d
' eave him to his (lumbers, and proceed to
itiake 3 single remark upon what fell from
the member from Maffachvifetts (Mr. Var
num) refpe&ing the unconllitutinnality of
one of the provisions of the fettion under
â  debate. It ccnld not be Jenied that the
' leading principle an i nhjeil of this feftion
was to authorize t'Â«Â» PreliJent to accept the
t services â  f such yo nnteer corps, as might be
induced fro n moti rs of the purest patrio
tism to offer thfnifilves for the defence of
their country, a: <i uo 1 gemlemart had venttn'i
{Volume XIII.
eel to fay that there was any thing unconllf
tntional in this. The part particularly'ob
jetted againlt was matter of detail, and might
be altered or modified, if the motion for
llriking out the whole ledtion waÂ« loft. He
was however free to declare for himfelf, that
he would not agree to alter a Angle word of
that provision which authorised the I'reiident
to appoint the commissioned officers, for it
was what he molt valued.
Mr. D. then replied to the member from
Pem.fylvania (Mr. Gallatin) who had
called these volunteer corps of militia, a moll
formidable force to be pot into the hands of
the I'rrfident. That they be a formi
dable body of men. Mr. D. was willing to
admit, and that he wished them to be so ;
but to whom, h-' asked, would they be truly
f. rmidableâTa the Invaders of our countryâ
To the turbulent and fetlitioui âTn hjurgeutb
âJo the during irfraSions <f the laws. The
member from Pent.fyl"ania aÂ£ted confidently
in regarding these volunteers a- iinneceffary
to defend the country againlt isvafion, be
cause he had affected to believe that fuel) an
attempt would not be made, but he would
not surely fay that there might not be inter*
nal commotions or ii furrec\ior.s which might
require the wholcfomc corieftion of luch an
armed force. That gentleman had endea
voured to fix upon them an utdividucu* dil
tin&ion, ia Ityling tnem ' military alloca
tions" ; but Mr. D, wiftied him to inform
the committee, what the troops who quelled
the Weitern iufurredton wire, if they. w era
Aot military aflociation He himfelf consi
dered the whole of them of that delciiption,
and he well reco!leÂ£tcd that a conliderabie
number in Ncw-jerfeyaa well as I'ennfylva
ina alfociated themselves together foi that
express purpose, weie accepted by the Pre.
fident and marched as volunteers upon that
expedition. Ihe gentleman from Pcr.nfvl'-
vanra mult have known how ufeful they were
011 that occalion, and he ha J not now to
learn that what has happened once, might
occur again.
Mr. I), concluded with expressing a very
eari eft wilh that the motion for Itriking out
this valuable feftion might be negatived, and
that the ferviccsof men so able, willing and
ready as these, to Itep forward in defence ot
their country, might not be rejedted.
Mr. Varnum did not wondef that the
Speak r (hould attach himfelf to this fedtion,
when he has heretof re declared, he would
defend the bill ii ch by inch. it was to be
expedted this bill would be carried, as gen
tlemen appear to be bent upon it j he wished
them, however, to (hew its util ty. Gen
tlemen fay it will be formidable. He did
not think it would bring any force into the
field. It could not be intended as a formi*.

are no provisions in the bill for dividing them
into brigades or divilions, for adtual service-
They are to be under the cothmand of the
President of the United States; but no pro
vision is made for their organization.
It was said the force proposed to be raised
by this fedtion could not be cor.fidered as un-
I conllitutiomrl, and gen lemen have been call
ied upon to fliew that it is so. He d.d not
know what was to be underllood t.y the pa
ragraph. except it was to be taken as it
Itands. He knew of no description of sol
diers but regulars and militia. If thtfe vo
lunteers are to be considered a3 triliiia, the
conltitutioÃ has said that the iiu Â» dual
dates shall appoint the officers; but it is
now faid,they are to be considered a as put
of the army. Confideritig them la this light,
he wouH turn the attentio- of gentlemen to
another part of the rontlitution where the
power of raising an its is placed in the le
jljiflsture ; but if this pjnver is given to the
President, he might raise an army to anv ex..
tent he please.v without the content ofCoie
grefs. There is nothing to prevent him
from engaging half the people 111 the United
Slates in this way. He .as not apprehe*-
five the I'refident would abnfe this power ;
but he thought the ConllitutioÃ ought to be
held sacred.
What are the armed A floeiat ions which
the gentleman from New-Jcrfey (Mr. Day
ton) speaks of? They are companies elta.
blifiied under ;he prefeut existing laws. Are
th?y not all officered already ! And what
better would they be if they were to offer
, their services to the Prefidiint and have of*
[ ficers appointed to them by him. than they
are at present, with officers ap ointcd by
â  the (late of New-Jersey ? He could fee no
good efFeft to be produced by the change,
but he was apprehensive it would cause great
, disorder iii tlie militia cotps. Andafterall,

life.
But his colleague (Mr. Otis) had said,
that gentlemen eontiutied oppe-fed to mea
-1 fures of defence. He h.iei no objedtion that
1 that gentleman fiiould found liis own praile
3 as to his readiness to defend his Â».u try,

In answer to that gentleman's call to point
Out aiy part f the Conllitution that is in

clause refpe?ing the appointment of militia
officers having Deen already read, he would
fetrr to that which declares the purpose's for
which the militia may be Called forth, viz. )
'â¢ to execute the laws of the U i n, sup

(though in fail militia, with new officers ap
pointed by ".he President) is oot to be thus

One word as to biÂ» own situation. He
had been pointed at as having fought in the
Re'o ution. It was true that he had fought
âit v.-as known, but he never boasted of it.
He trulledi if there was again necessity for
it. he should be as ready to defend his coun
try as the gentleman from New Jerftv, or
atyothrr.
Mr. Dayton, said, that opposed as he
was in argument by toe m mbersfrom Mas
facimfrtts and North Carolina, who he un
derused v. .re Gererals of Militia, he was
compelled to own that th" weight of rank

ii ! -ey i (TeiTsd any military knowledge
whatever, they mull at once perceive that
the pofitior. they had taken wai untenable.
They had relied much upon the declaration
which h- should not controvert, viz. that
t'.ia country in cafe of ferjous icVafion mul
be defended by the great body of the militia,
and not by Anode companies or feleft corps;
but did it tlience follow t! at it would not be
advisable to encou.age and accept the fer

lonp; the exter.five fcaboard; and were wil
ling <nj ready to bfcome the advance guard,
Slid fubjedt thc..-fe!ve> to be firfl called upon
for duty. WitS* as much propriety might
it be said tha because in time of War 'the
main, body of the Army mini bear the brunt
of battle, you mud not have an advanced
corps. -It was this valuable puipofe which
thek voluuuteers would be well cadilated to
fffeel, because they were generally fifuated
nearetl to the feacoafts, and were for the
molt part better equipped, armed and accou
tred thai .any other portions of the militia.
The'.' would also be men wiil.r.g to serve, and
it .o th- ft were give:i loiiimg office's alio, a
gretahly to :he provifiarts in the feCiion, he
trusted that their services in time of danger
would be tou. d to be equal to the mod san
guine expectations that had been formed of
litem.
r. R. Will i ams was at alofstoknow
how gentlemen meant to apply their obser
vations with refpedt to the unconstitutional
tty o> the President's rppointing the officers
io these corps, -on a motion to strike cut the
fectioa ; because if the motion doe; not eb
taia.the ftflioucanbe anendedin this refpeft.
Mr. W. said he was opposed so ihis bill,
as it . tut to raise a (landing army ;~but with
refpeft to this part' of the bill he was in fa
vor of it. As to coiifequences which may
a rife from the abuse of the power p-opofed
to be placed in the President, he did not
thick that a proper fubjeft of enquiry, for
he did net know how gentlemen could recon
cile the idea to our government of fufpefting
erery department of abusing the power
pla Â»d in them. If the persons who fill the
offices are base enoag'i to do it, all of them
may be abused. So far as the constitution
lias pointed out caution as neceflarj, our
jealousy ought to go to guard against the
abuse of power, but to fay a power fhall-not
be granted, because it is liable to be abused.
goes ajainft'placing power any where.
This feÂ£t:on, Mr. W. said, only went to
eltablifli the principle that the President may
accept of the service of volunteer corps 5 the
detail of it may be a rended as the commit-,
tee thinks proper. If it could not be amend
ed, he fhou'.d be disposed to vote against it ;
but, until he found no amendment could be
made in it, he (hould vote for retaining the
feQion. As to the principles on which the
service of these corps should be accepted, or
the particular ptirpofes for which they should
be called out, they ought to be deligi ated.
The committee had got into difficulty, from
not cosfidcring what these volunteers ought
to be called. If that wa3 determined, he
thought gentleme* would know what line of
conduit to pursue. If they were called
militia, the coaftitution has direfted the
mode of appointing officers to be by the
dates ; if regulars, that the I resident shall
appoint them. By one of these descriptions
they mull be called. He had thought that
this point was in some measure decided on
the motion to strike out the word regular,
which being carried, he thought these volun
teers were to be ccnfidered a; a part of the
militia, and) from that circumstance, he ap
prehended no danger from retaining the
c'aufe, as he thought it would be the means
of a good militia. He fhcu d,
. therefore vote again It ftrikiug out the feflion,
with au expectation that it will tndtrgo a

Mr. Macon rose, and said hiscblleague had
laid upon him rhe painful task of informing
the house, that thair friend and colleague Co
lonel Bryan is no more ; that he died this
morning at nine o'clock.
Mr. J. Parker hoped that a resolution
of a similar kind to that which was adopted
on the death of a colleague of his (Colonel
Bland) when Congrcfs fat at New-York,
would now be agreed to. He accordingly
proposed the following :
Refolded, That the members -from the Jlate of
North-Carolina be acpmmiteeto superintend the
funeral of the deceased, and that this house luill

The resolution was unanimously carried,
and the members having had a meeTing, Mr:

The Hambuigh mÂ«i) due yesterday arrived about

by the French papers. The following atticie from

" This day (April b) was held the 38th fitting of

" The law requiring all who are members of the

SWITZERLAND.
By the information which we have been
able to collect from different quarters, it ap
pears that the whole of the interval from the
time when the prolongation of the armistice
waj agreed upon, to the sth of March, on
which day the French entered Berne, was
one continued series of intrigue and perfidy
on the part of the French, and of timidity,
irresolution, and inconsistency on that of
the Bernese government.
The French had, as we have already ob
ferTed, from the beginning, their partizans
in the councils of Berne ; some, perhaps,
but those probably few in number, won
over to them by aftual personal corruption;
others, enamoured of their principles, and
desirous of innovating, at all hazards, upon
the ancient constitution of their country for
the fake of trying the experiment of a con
stitution founded on Liberty-and Equality:
âOthers, again (probably the larged num
ber)dcluded by the hope, that if the pre
sent Wsfr could by any means be brought
to a termination, they should be able, by
fair parley & negociation, tobringthe French
to a sense of the injuflice of their attack up
on Switzerl nd, as well as of the interest
which France must have in preserving the
friendfhip and good will of so rcfpe&able a
neighbour, rather than in incurring its ever
lasting enmity, by a continued and unprofi
table aggression. AiSting upon one or other
of these principles, a con fit! er ble majority
ol the Council opposed the manly and deci
live raeafures which the Avoyer Steigner,
and those members of the government, who
saw with just apprehension the real; and, to
fay the truth,'the almost undisguised designs
ol France againlt the liberty, and the exi
stence of Switzerland'as an independentcouo
tfy, would nave adopted, early in 'he con
test, measures, which would probably have
checked, in the firft onset, the ardour of the
French, and which their own people, not
only would have carried through with spirit
aitd cheerfulnefs, if called upon to do fo,but
did themfelvcs call upon their govenmeut
to bring forward, and ultimately overwhel
med with their vengeance, those whom they
fufpefted of having prevented their adop
tion.
The majority were for treating; but they
did not ptefume to think themselves in a
situation even to treatâto treat with an in
vading enemy, until they had endeavoured
to propitiate that enemy, by a facrifice of
so much of their anciei t laws and privileges,
as they thought might,induce him to lillen
with patience to some modest proposals for
the preservation of the remainder. They
refarmad, therefore, and they opened a ne
gociation. The refoim destroyed the ener
gy of the government at home. The ne
gociatiou gave ample-room to the French,
not only to tucreafe their force by frefh de
tachments from the Italian army, but also
to regulate their operations from without,
in such a manner as (hould belt tally with
the preparations for their 1 eception, which
was busily carried on by their friends with
in the walls of Berne. â¢
It is unnecessary to repeat here what has
been published in all the newspapers of Eu
rope, the terms of peace which trance pro
posedâthe modifications under which the
dastardly rulers of Betne offered to accept
them, It is fufficient to observe, that the
p ice which France exafted for forbearance,
was precisely, or within a trifle, the fame
as the penalty which she has inflicted for re
sistanceâthe subversion of the ancient gov
ernment, and the substitution of one on the
French modelâholtages, proscriptions of
individuals and of familiesâand a sum of
money.
While the councils deliberated on these
and such like demands, the peasantry of the
country were crouding to the gateÃ of Berne
with offers of and demanding to be
led against the invaders. The spirit of the
troops rose at times so high, that the co n
cil had not the courage- nor the power to
repress it. And On the 26th February,
General D'Erlach, received full powers to
attack the enemy, if he Ihould fee it right,
immediately upon the expiration of the ar
mistice, 011 the 2d March. This concefixon
was no sooner extorted from the council,
than the French general Brune was apprised
of it by the French fa&ion. He took his
measures accordingly, deteimining tÂ» makt
the attack Simfelf, when the Swiss (hould
not be prepared for it. He proposed a ucw
conference for the amicable arrangement of
existing differences. The French faftion
supported the proposal, as highly likely to
produce an advantageous and honorable
peaceâthe majority of the council were in
duced to < ome into it ; part because they
were weary of oppofiug to no purpose; and
part (the profoundly stupid members), yiel
ded to the old argument, that 3 rrfufal
would irritate the enemy, and would give
him an opportunity of proving to Europe,
that they were not fi;cere in the\r defirfc
for accommodation.âFifty members
had the good sense. to oppose the measure,
but in vain.
The consequence of detei mining upon this
new conference with an armet} tnemy, in
the heait of their country, was the [with
drawing the authority given to 'general
D'Erlach, to attack him cn the expiration
of the armistice I and thus leaving the Swiss
army at mercy ofthe Frenchgoodfaith. For
a moment, on the firil of Marsh, the coun
cil seemed to have been sensible of their im
prudence, and a resolution was hallily ob
tained, restoring to general D'Erlach the
liberty to atta k the next day.' but in the
eourfe of a few hours, the French faiSion
re gained its ascendency, and general D'Er
lach's powers were again withdrawn. The
result was what might be expefled While
the deputies of Berne and Fribourg, were,
conferring at the conferences of Paverne,
arid the comcil of Berne was hugging itfelf
in the notion of not irritating the "enemy
and of having put it oÂ»t of his power to
prove to Europe, that they were not sin
cere in their desire for accommodationâthe
French general Brune, did precisely what
he-had all along intended to do, and what
the supporters of the present system in the
council perfectly knew that he intended, he
attacked the Swiss army on the eight of the
1 ftâthe battle was obftinatg and bloody ;
but there was an officer high in command
in the Swifi army who was unwilling to 1 r
ritate the enemy. He abandoned his
chargeâthe battle was loft, and Frilpourg
was taken. The name of this wretch ha*
not reached us. We look anxiously for an
opportunity of consigning it to contempt
and execration.
General Brune entered Fribourg, as has
been mentioned in a former paper, on the
fame night that the army under general
Schaunenbourg entered Soleure We have no
further par.iculars than what we have alrea
dy given. Fribourg, we understand, was
given up to every species of excefsand out
rage. The Avoyer Verro, a magillrate of
high charader, and who condudted himfelf
with exemplary courage, was butchered,
his body was mutilated in a uioft (hocking
manner, and his head paraded round the ci
ty on a pike ! ! !
From the moment of the loss of this bat
tle by the treachery of an officer, fnfpicion
and disunion were propagated through the
Swiss army. The French knew how to
improve thefÂ« difpofitior s. Their emissa
ries spread themselves through the Canton,
pointing out as objetls of distrust, every
man of real charafter; honesty and courage
âsuggesting to the peasantry the danger of
trusting themselves to the couduft of men
who were hired to betray them ; and re
commending them to ensure their fafety by
ftandingby quiefly, and letting things take
their course. In many parts of the nor
thern cantons, a Louis d'.or was known to
be the fixed price which any man might re
ceive for merely declining to march to the
alfiftance of Berne.
The movements of the Swiss army were
such as to give countenance tn these notions
amongthepeople-asfrom thefecond day they
were (necessarily perhaps, and inevitably af
ter, having miffed the firft opportunity of
attaeking) in one continued ret eat.âThey
fought however, in retreating. On the
2d, 3d, and 4th, there were repeated and
desperate engagements, in every one of
which the Swiss soldiers fought, in the firft
instance, with the greatest fury ag3i'nft the
French, and afterwards, when they were
obliged ta fall back, turned their arms 3-
gainst their officers, whom they fufpefted
of slackness, or of trea hery. [
The Council at Berne in the mean time
continued faithful to the system of coward
ice and with which they had
fetout. They Hill continued reforming and
negociatingâa provisional government was
erefled ; and there remained but one ar
ticle left to dispute with tho enemy, which
was the immediate disbanding of all their
troops.
Ytt however, the spirit of. patriotism
was not extinguilhed ror suppressed among
the people of the country. That part of
the troops which were at Berne, demanded
loudly to be led against the French army un
der Schauenbourg, which was now rapidly
advancing from Soleure towards the city.â.
The provifionalgovt rxntent, though it might
have the will, wanted the power, to lelift
the entHusiasm of the troops. The venera
ble Avoyer De Steigncr put himfelf at their
head,Â»and if we are to credit (which we
are unwilling to do, while there is yet a
hope that onr other accounts may be true)
the intelligence that we imparted with so
mnch foriow in our firft account ofthe bat
tle of the sth ult. and of which we have
subsequently received confirmation, this ad
mirable man periflied under the walls ps
Berne, true to a resolution which he ha'd
long cherilh<|d, and. .often expressed in the
course of the discussions that preceded the
surrender of Switzerland to French negoci
alior, th t if an honourable death were tohe found, he would r.ct iurvivc tlieciiflave
metit of his country.
At his fideperillied !n the fumebattle, the
flower of the Patrician youth of Berne,
wliu, from the age of fourteen, had form
ed themselves into corp , and fought till the
last individual amomrft them was fiaiu
Not a family of nJiftiniftion in Berne but has
to record the services and the facrifices of a
fan or a brother, on this memorable and ca
lamitous day.
On this point at lead, amidst the horrors
and misfortunrs, the follies and the crimes
which we are contemplatingâon this, we
dwell with complacency as well as regret,
and on this would fix the attention of our
countrymen. We have often heard the
Patrician blood of Berne undervalued and
derided. It has proved itfelf not incapable
of high sentiment and a&ion. Such
conduft reufl rescue them from contempt.
We trust it will recommend them to imita
tion.
After the loss of this battle, all was ter
ror The Swiss troops, en
raged at their defeat, confident that they
had done all that courage could do, and
taught to impute to their leaders a want of
leal in the cause of their country, if not
an understanding with the enemy, goaded
and i.ifcmed by t' e agents of the direftorp,
who po'intcd ont as the inilrurxu'nte of their
disgrace and defeat, those men who had been
crafted in their best endeavours to save the
country, wreaked their difappointflirnt up
on their leaders; and general D'Erlach,
with his whole fteff, and such members of,
t'<e old government as were moll marked for
their l.odility to France, fell a facrilice to
their miflaken fury.
From this periwd, when the Trench took
pon s fiion of Berne,nothing certain is known
refpc:K"g tile ifate of Switzerland, except
what is the natural conclusion, from the
fticcefs of the Frenchâthat the whole of
the country round Berneâa country here
tofore peaceable, flourifliing and happy be
yond the ordinary lot of nationsâhas been
abandoned to a mercdefs pillage, accompa
nied with circumstances of crcel'y and
r ' brutality of whirh any individual instance
would f'-rm a pifture too sickening, too full
of disgust and horror, to be offtred to the
view cf a civilized people.
From this date, whatever letters come
from Berne, must have parted under the in
spection of the French. They state that
Berne, Fribourg, and Solcurci have been
completely revolutionizedâthat the French
were marching again (I Lucerne and Zurich :
and that the shattered remains of the Ber
nese army had retired to Thunn, and the
Vallies at the foot of the Alps, accompa
nied by several of their magistrates.
The mountainous cantons have not yet
been reduced ; nor have they been persuad
ed to aecept the aflurances of perfeft securi
ty, and of the friendfliip'of Faance, which
are proffered to them, on condition of sur
rendering their arms.

TUESDAY EVENING, June J.
TI-IE DISPATCHES
From our Envoys at Paris, tin's day com
municated. by of the United
! .States, to bo'h houses of Csngrefs, cOnfifl
of a letter dated on the 9th of March iall,
enclosing minutes of two conferences, ob
tained at the inftnnce of the E voys, on the
2d and 4th (or 6th*) of the fame month,
with the Minifler for Foreign Affairs. At
the fir ft conference, General Pinckney in
troduced the conversation, by expre.Ti'ig the
anxiety of the American government and
Envoys to remove the subsisti n g differences
between the two coun'ries. He fairl that
many inadmiflible propofi ions for effefling
that objeft, had been receive# by them
through M. Y. and that thev had' waited
upon the minister, to know whether other
means might be devised to obtain so desira
ble an end. In answer M. Talleyrand
said that the DireÂ£lory werej ex'remely
wounded by the speech of General Wash
ington, when about to retire from office,
and by the firft and lad speech of Mr. A
dams ; and that explanations were required
of the Envi.ys ; and that, previous to treat
ing with them, the D reflory ixpeaed some
proof on the part of the United States of a
friendly di'fpofitfo'n. Here M. Talleyrand
alluded very inte/lig bty to a loan General
Pinckney having intimated that a loan wo Id
exceed their powers M. Talleyrand dre-.v
a diftin&ion between acting contrary to in
ftruflions and adling in a cafe where they
were silent, and urged that in the latter cafe
it was their duty to ule their discretion for
the public good. He said the principal ob
jection of the American government to a
loan ma ft be its tendency to draw it out of
a neutral situation , and remarked that there
were several ways of obviating such an ef
.edt j luch as a reliance on the secrecy of
France, difguiling the loan, making it pay
able by distant instalments and France rais
ing present supplies upon the credit of it.â
To this it was an'wcred, that they conceiv
ed their inftru&ions did, not admit of a
loan ; that the United States had resolved
faithfully to maintain their neutrality ; that
they would do nothing in lecret which if
known would arrange them among the bel
ligerent powers ; that as they could not, if
leagued with France, furn.fli either men or
(hips of war, and money being the only
thing that would beafked of them, to fur
nifh money was in fad to make war. The
minister repeated the necessity there was of
proving our friendfllip for the Republic
by some immediate aid, or by fomethi g
which might avail them.'âln the course of
the conversation the minister complained of
the Envoys not having visited him,and pre'
tended that the original favourable disposi
tion of the Direftory had been a good deal
altered by the coldness and distance which
the Envoys had observed ; because they
had cot made private vijits to him and said
he conceived their not having hadanaudience
of the direftory ought not to have prevent
ed it. General Marshall told him, that their
feeing the Direftory or not, was an objeft
sf 00 fort of concern to tliem, but that it j
was their opinion, that until their public j
character was in some degree recognized, j
they could not take upon themselves to aft |
as ministers. The minister said that was ve- j
ry true, but that.they might fee him as
private individuals, and discuss the objefts
of difference between the two nations.
At the second conference on the 4th (or
6th) the Envoys observed that they had
previously attended to the conversation they
had had with the minister ; thaCthe propo
rtions he had suggested appeared to them
to be fubftantiallv the fame with those made
by Messrs. X. & Y ; and they explicitly de
clared that in addition to those propofitious j
if acceded to, amounting to a declaration
of war against Great-Britain, their inftrufti
ons were express, not to ilipulate any aids
to France, either direftly or ihdireftly du
ring the war.
The conference on the part of the minister
chiefly confided of a repetition of the re
marks and propositions he had made on the
2d of the month. The Envoys several times
told the minister that if.it would be agree
able to the Direst ry two of them wou'd re
turn to America to receive the inftruftions
of the Government on the aftual situation
of thing 3, but they were unable to draw any
reply from him.^Thus ended the conference.
* It it uncertain on which of ilicftt days the lift
conference was held.
This morning the remainscfMr.BsYAN,
whose der.th was announced yesterday, were

On the parade of the Blues,of the Federal
Legion, two hundred and fifty attended

a variety of evolutions with an accuracy
which gave great fatisfaftion to the officers

Of REPUBLICAN MODESTT,
Take the following sample from the dying
lips of the Jacobin Aurora.
" Wc can teadily believe, thst there are
persons high in office, even in the Federal
Government,'friendly to the cause of liberty

ciples of the Constitution, unadulterated by
Tory conftruttiofis, and who would, there

were lately built for the purpose of calling Cannon
for this Slate.âThere are about two thousand acres
of Land, one half of which is under wood, theother
very fine arable Land, prbducing the best Hay and

NOTICE.
HAVING observed an advertifemcnt of C.
Gullagcr, in terms derogatory of our pro
feffional abilities, we have to requell the public
not to be imposed upon by foreign artiftt ; but to
decide upon the naei its of each by a comparison ol
the work executed by both, as it is a mode almost
universally adopted by them to invalidate the ta
lents Â«f eftabliihed artists, with a view of deceiv
ing the public, and engrofling that business which
their profeflional knowledge in no wife entitles
them to. Well knowing that public opinion must
govern, we flatter ourselves that the work execut
ed by us will convince them of our great superio
rity over Mr. Gullager in every branch of por
trait and ornamental painting, and (hew thenecef
fity of judging for themselves.
N. B. In future no attention will be paid to
felf-flattering v.dvertifements of Mr G.
Any person wilhing a supply of FLAGS and
DRUMS will please apply to Geo. Rutter and
Co. Norris' Court, or Hesjxy Frailet, Germae
