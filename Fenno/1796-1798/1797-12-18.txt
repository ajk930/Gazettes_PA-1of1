THE Managers particularly reqaeft the con
currence of the public in the abolition of a
cuftosn, which lias hitherto obtained, ef giving a
way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at the
Theatre. Â«
They are aware that gentlemen are unconscious
of any wrong dene to the interest of the inft tu
tion by this practice, from a general, though rnif
taken idea that Cheiks are the representatives of a
right to so many feats in the Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will;
when in fadt, they were never intended as more
tnan tuhut by which the Door-keepers are enabled
to afcertairs with the least trouble to the parties, that
the* themfclvei have been before in the fheatfe, or
paid for their admiffiun.
Independent of the injÂ® y the Managers sustain,
such a practice encourages a croud of idle boys and
other disorderly persons to surround the doors of
the Theatre, to the corruption of their morals and
the great annoyane'e of the Audience.
It has also been the fotirce of two evils of no iu
confiderablc magnitude; one is, that fomctiines
very improper company is by thel'e means admit
ted ; and the otber, that owin 4 to Checks palling
into difhonclt haut'.s, they have been frequenaly
counterfeited to a large amount for the pur poles of

This statement will, it isrefpeitfully hoped, in
duce the Public to discourage fudi a traffic : and
the exertio.-js of the Managers wilt, if thus allillcd,
easily prove adequate to its entire abolition.

THURSDAY DECEMBER 14..
Continuation, of tht Debate on the fubjiÃ of
ForAgn Coins.
Mr. Ha vens thought the report of the
, committee was somewhat inconsistent, as it
proposed crowns, &c. should pass at their
full value at the cudom house, yet expect
ed them to depreciate, and by that means get
to the bank. Besides, said he, their not be
ing a legal tender, will not depreciate them ;
for it was not one payment in ten thousand
in which it was necefl'ary to make a legal
tender : it was seldom, that a creditor was
compelled to receive a debt ; creditors were
every where ready to receive tV|eir money
. generally before their debtors were ready to
pay. Banknotes were not alegaltender in
sny parts of the United States, yet there
'was no difficulty in pafSng them. If a cre
ditor were offered cup-ent money, he would
not care any thing about its not being a le
gal tender ; but, if n legal tender were re
quired, it would be an easy matter to pro
' cure money which was legal for that which
was current. The inconvenience which
had been complained of, from the deprecia
tion of crowns, arose from the alarm which
the proclamation on the filbjeft had occa
sioned ;but when thatalarm ceased, which it
soon would do, crowns would pass as usual.
He was warranted in this supposition by the
law refpefting eppper coin, which - forbade
any copper coin, except cents and half
cents, from being circulated, on pain of be
ing forfaited, besides ten dollarsas a penalty ;
yÂ«, notwithstanding base copper coin was
every where in circulation. He refered to
another law of a similar nature. It was
clear, therefore, that coin would not be ferc
cdNnto the mint, except its value was de
- preciated, which must be effefted not only
oy faying it shall not be a legal tended but
by making it penal to offer it in payment.
Besides, if it wo,!' 1 have the efjpft to force
the foreign, coin into the cuft'om-houfes, it
would never get into the mint. The coin
eollefted at Boston and other distant ports,
did not come to Philadelphia ; but, fnppofe
the law fixed the matter so, that such coin
should come into the T rea f u, 7 of tfce Unft
ed States, it would not be difficult to (hew
that it would be impossible for government
to put it into the mint to be recoined. He
was warranted in this conclusion by the law
regulating foreign c<oin. That aft, he said,
declared, that all gold and silver coin, except
Spanish dollars, and parts thtreof, received
by government, should not be re-ifTued-, but
sent to the mint to be re-coined ; yet this
law had not been complied with. Mr. H.
r said, he was on a committee refpefting the
mint last year, and he enquired of the Se
cretary of the Treasury why this law had
not gone into effeft, arid he was given for
answer, that the mint was in such a situation
that it could not give any security that the
coin sent there would be, re-coined in any
reasonable time. Indeed, from what he said,
he inferred, that government wanted the
money so much,thatit could not befparedto
go to the mint. To agree to the report,
would have the appearance of giving fop
port to the mint ; but it would not be i tal
ly doing any such thing. This was his idea.
But if this coin were to go to the mint,
â¦, where be the advantage ? He cou "
not fee any. HÂ« believed, therefore, the
bed way would be to suspend the operation
' of the aft restraining the circulation of fo
reign coin, and leave the mint upon its pre
sent footing until something effectual could
be done for its support.
Mr. Baldwin said, in determining upon
the question before them, it was not neceff
srjr to examine the principles upon which
the mint was eftabliflied. Supposing all j
the principles, and the effefts supposed to be .
produced right, the only thing was, they \
wereexpefted to have been producedfooner J
than it was now found they were. He ,
could not agree to the motion of the gentle
man from Pennfylvani?. He thought they '
should extend the time of withdrawing fo
reign coin fro In circulation for a year or two
longer. Nor would he have it supposed
from the wish, that he was hostile to the !
mint .* he originally voted for it, and was
not now convinced it would not prove e- t
â ventually advantageous to the country. To
give further time for the maturing of this
business, was doing no more than they were
obliged frequently to do in other business |
under this government. They were scarce
ly ?ware how slowly the laws parted over so
e*tenfive a country as'' ours. He believed j
the law proposed to (top the circulation of
certain species of foreign coin had done ,
some good } but he believed it would have j
a bad effeft, if it were to take place the en- t
suing summer. He did not believe that
the mint establishment had ever before be-n
contemplated for so extensive a country as
the United States. In molt countries where t
njints were established, there was, he said, a t
great mercantile center, which afted like the 7
heart in the human body, to circulate the j (
medium of commerce. livthis country the
cafe was different. Some parts of the U-
nited States, he said, were almost as much
connected with other countries at they were
with other parts of our own. In Great- t
Britain, fnprinltance, when the coin got dc- t
based, it was always transmitted to London n
to be re-coined and new coin could always
be received in its flead. But, said he, we â
must be contented to move more slowly.
In some instances, where mints had been es
tablished, tfiere was not so much Bank pa- ].
per in circulation as in this country, which
had been a mean of retarding our progress. t(
He was not, however, for giving up the ob- t .
jett, becaule their expectations had been, in
some degree, deceived. He did not think [
the mint could ever be supported by foreign n
coin alone ; it%vould be necessary. to be sup
plied with bullion also. Gentlemen had
said the effefts of our coin had not been felt c
at all. They had certainly been fell confid- _
y erably, in some parts. Some valuable plate ' ;
'li?d, of late been brought to the mint from >
foreign countries, more than perhaps would ]
. be brought in futuie. But he hoped fur- c
ther time would be given before foreign 7
coin was attempted to be withdrawn from t
f circulation. J Â£
Mr. R. Williams wa3 in favor of post- ' r
e poning the operation of the law ; though j r
j he could not fee so diftinftly as other gen- j e
r tlertien the difference between the report of a
. the committee, and tue proposition of the a
t gentleman from Virginia. The committee i(
. fay French crowm, &c. shall be received for o
. revenue, but shall not be a common tender, g
[ If the report had rgade them a tender for tl
1 a " payments under the federal government, w
, he thought the report would have, been of tl
. equal extent with -.the amendment ; as he c<
r supposed congress had not the power of fay- w
j ing what should, or should not be a tender in pi
, the several dates. He thought he was war- cÂ«
. ranted in this assertion by the constitution, tl
_ in the Bth feftion of the ift article of which tli
|. i' was said, " Congress shall have the pow- th
_ er to coin money, regulate the value thereof, jei
. and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of gi
. weights and measures and in v the ioth
, feftion of the-fame article, where it speaks fu
i of what the individual states shall not do, it w<
fays, "no (late shall coin money, emit bills ha
, of credit, make any thing but gold and fil- qi
. ver coin a tender in payment of debts." cc
. From these two pafTages of the constitution, la
it was evident, that that the individual flares tic
, might make a tender of what coin theypleaf- th
ed, provided they did it according to the wl
: value fixed upon it by congress. So that as
the difficulty would not be so great as had re
been imagined, if the law wasnot postponed, pe
though he thought it ought to be, as it had th
not been fufficiently notified. Another rea- ce
son with him for wishing for a postponement ha
was, that if farther time were given, the dif- th
ferent slates would make their tender laws fie
conformable to thofeof the United States afl
if not, they would keep up their prcfent laws w<
and there would be a clashing betwixt them, th
He profefTed himfclf a friend cf the mint wl
establishment, as he supposed the principles tit
upon which if was founded were laudable ha
and proper ; but he was againfl carrying th
any law into effeft which should injure the sal
people of the United States. ye
Mr. Gallatin said no kind of th>
aversion to the mint establishment itfelf; he ly
vvifhed to fee it well supported with bullion, Tl
and of importance to the United States ; ad
but he felt some aversion to the expences of an
the establishment, without any benefit being ! gr
produced from it. So far as this went, the cn
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Otis) cit
might apply his obfervatiou to him of " be- be
ing an enemy to the mintyet he thought an
that gentleman was mistaken in thinking the ftil
piefent queflion was so closely connefted in
with the existence of the mint. He believ- arj
ed if there were means of making the mint rei
establishment beneficial, they were not those mi
proposed by tkat gentleman. There were it
two fubjefts before the committee ; theone bo
to suspend the aft altogether, the other to ma
leave it to operate on gold coin only. He op
believed a single view of the quantity of otl
gold coin ifiued from the mint fmceits eftab- lio
iifhnient, would shew the latter to be an im- th(
proper measure. The whole amount of Ai
gold coined it the mint on the 30th of Sep- tra
te mber, 1796, was only the value of 149,445 wa
dollars. When the laws relative to the fuf- . de<
pension of the circulation of Foreign coins alv
were pafled, it was on the idea that at the i upi
time the provisions were to take effeft, there 1 wo
would be a fufficiency of our own coin to ' an(
supply its place. It was clear th?.t this waÂ».i tht
not thfe cafe ; and he did not fee how a per-! be
son could be charged withenmity tothc mint' wo
becaufe*he was dilpofed toallow farther time ' fak
for iis opsrationn. It could not be expeft- ' tht
ed, Mr. G. said, under prcfent circumltanc- j me
es.jthatmuch Foreign coin should be brought fpe
to the mint, until it were depreciated ; wo
therefore, unless the amendment of his col- ket
league went to depreciate it, they could not ero
suppose it would go to the mint. He drew ply
this conclusion from what had already taken wh
place ; for out of 10,000 ounces of gold rei{
which had been received at the mint, not flar
more than 1300 were in coin. Except Fo- wo
reign coin was, therefore, reduced to the mai
value of bullion, it would not go to the its
mint, and it would certainly be unjust to re- sam
due? it, whilst it remained in the hands of fere
the people. In relation to Foreign silver moi
coin, a difference of opinion cxifted whether wer
the law fhoilld be wholly or partially fuf- thu
pended as it related to it. In the firft place No
it might be observed, that the proportion filvi
which French crowns bore to whole amount and
of foreign silver coin in circ Ation was very cou
small, and therefore no great advantcge fro;
could be derived to the United States from fuel
throwing them out of circulation. But, bee
said he, suppose all the French crowns in the
. the United States, were now in the mint, the
and were to be re-coined into dollars, where was
would be the advantage ? He did not under- erni
stand that the objeft of the mint was merely givi
to put a certain impreflion upon money, but was
that we might observe a proper controul o- imp
ver our circulating medium, so a* to keep the
it pure. Suppose the proportion of French wa)
crowns to dollars, were as ten to one, would thei
not theeffeft be, that nine-tenths of our cir- coit
culating medium would (till be in Foreign obfl
coin ? Where then would be the advan- wot
tage ? If the French crowns were debased, mec
there would be some reasons for cal ing them mer
in, but not otherwise. It might be said it less
would give employment to the mint j but it ?
would be employment without advantage, mig
which could not be desired. But it had den
been shewn by. the gentleman ftom Mary- 'J
land, that if the French crowns were in the tive
banks, it would be impossible to get them i
to the mint, from the expence of tranfpor- jest
tation, and the loss which would be occafi- For
owed by the absence of the coin from their thti
coffers. There was, in his opinion, a havi
much easier way of replenishing the mint, wbt
without encountering any of the difficulties ban
which would attend the forcing out of cir- ton,
culation Foreign coin ; it was by rtiaking of t
an appropriation of joo,ooo dollars for the aboi
late purchase of bullion, nnd this was the biily
rom way in which it could he efTedlually dune.-
>uld But this was not all; suppose all the Foreign
fur- com in circulation re-coined into dollar?, '
rign What would be the effect ? They would
rom be exported by our pierchants equally with
Â« Spanish dollars, whereas, whilst the silver
oft- remained in croW'n, they were fuffered to
igh 1 rcmafh. Mr. G. said he had already obferv
en- I ed, he was opposed to the miut only, if no
of advantage could be derived from it; and if,
the after goinginto the bulinefs as far as possible,
tee it was found the eftablifnment could not be
for of any use,. it certainly would 1 e better to
ler. get rid of it. But whatever his opinion on
for this fubjedt might be, it was unconnected
â¢lit, with the present queiton. The of
of the committee on the fubjedt of the mint, re
'ne commended an appropriation of money,
ly- which was certainly the eheapefl w,ay of ftip
â¢in porting it. When that report came under
ar- confederation, question would arise whe
)n, ther the establishment was afeful, er whe
ch ther it should b'e abandoned. He hoped
w- the amendment of his colleague would be re
of, jeeted, and that of the gentleman from Vir
of ginia agreed to.
ith Mr. Otis rose to reply, and that
ks such arguments of the gentleman last up, as
,it were at all pertinent to the fubjedt would
ills have been more applicable if the original
fil- qiieftion relative to the suppression of foreign
1." coin were before the committee. But as the*
in, law afledtiHg this coin in adtual opera
tes tion, the true question was whether some of
if- the inconveniences were not pad remedy, and
he whether all theft objections would not occur
lat arter any limited period. The law had al- I
ad ready operated injuriously upon necessitous
â¢d, perfonswho had been compelled to part with
ad their foreign silver at a discount of ten per j
;a- cent. It was now accumulated either in the
nt hands of those who had speculated upon
if- their neceflities, or of those who had a fuf
,vs ficiency of other kinds of money, ani'could ,
i ; afFord the expence arid delay, if any, that ,
if/s would att<tid the re-coinage ; but to suspend
n, the law for two years, would enable thqfe ,
nt who held this coin to return it into circula
es tion aran advanced rate, among thofe-who i ,
.le had already been compelled to fuffer a loss j ,
lg the inconveniencies would be aggravated, and ,
he fall upon the fame class of people. Two ,
years hence, there would be more silver in |
of 1 the country, and it would be more remote
he jly diffufed with our increafug population. t
n, ! The obftruition of circulation would then j
I ; affedt a larger portion oi the community, ,
of and every argument would then apply with
ig ! greater force. If it was truethat the French
he crowns amounted o(f!y to a tenth part of the ]
s) circulating silver ; it wag a good reason for
e- beginning with the ftippreffion of those ;
ht and although a great part of the coin would
he still be foreign, a gradual reformation would t
:d in time supplant it altogetherâbut if this f
v- argument was intended to prove that if so- {
nt reign coin should not be decried until the r
fe mint had coined enough to supply its place; j
re it would follow that the mint should be a- t
ic bolifhed ; for this could never happen j no ;
to man acquainted with the nature of money t
le operations could imagine that by this or any ]
of other institution a fufficient quantity of bul- f
b- lion could be collected to supplant at once j
n- the whole foreign coin in actual circulation. {
of As to the expence and delay attending the j,
p- of the crowns to the mint, it 0
,5 was true that they would amount to a small j
f- ; deduction from their real value ; this mult
as always happen ; but tilt's would sals chiefly h
le | upon the Wanks into whose vaults the silver t
re , would bo colledted from the cuftam-houfes, v
:o and this would be rendered inconsiderable to
is.; those inflitutions, as large quantities could n
r-1 be transported with a fiViall escort, and they jj
it! would gladly defray the expence for the c
le | fake of having the money pass twice thro'
t- thu'r vaults. Mr. Otis denied that this i
-" 1 measure would facilitate the exportation of , 3
it specie. He did not believe that our dollars [j
; would be in greater demand for foreign mar- c
1- kets at least for sometime than French
)t crowns ; but however that might be, a lup
iv ply of specie would always be required, and Â£
n when required it would be procured for so- 1
d reign markets. If the coin was all of one j.
>t standard and denomination, no mifchief r(
>- would arise from its exportation The de- a ]
le mand would be jaft what it ought to be, and
e its place would be always supplied with the
fame kind of coin. It was only while a pre- 11
if ference existed in favor of one description of
t money, that unnatural 3nd forced means C
r were adopted for retaining the money, and
- thus obftrudting the free course of trade.
e Nor would this diminish the importation of
a silverâ..The real difference between bullion S
it and coined filrer was so trifling iu most
y countries, that no reason was to be inferred
e from the small importatiohs of bullion, that E
n such a decided preference was given to coin S
, because it was current in 'this cojwtryâOn
II the contrary the value of bullion being for
:, the most part superior to that of coin, it
e was often purchased by the European gov- S
â¢- ernments, and a premium was sometimes
Y givea for bringing it to the mintsâThis
t was the true reason why so little had been
- imported, but he had 110 apprehension that
p the merchants of this country would not al
ii ways be glad to receive silver and gold for
i their commodities, either as bullion or as Si
- coin. The course of trade was not to be
1 obftrudted byobftaclesof this natureâThere
- would be always a quantity of circulating
, medium adequate to the purposes of com
-0 merteâAnd there could never be more or
t less than that quantity fÂ«r a lotig period. Si
t Mr. Brookes wished the committee B
, might rife, in order to give time for eonfi
-1 deration.
The question for rising was put and nega
e tived 47 to 33.
1 Mr. Macon said it seemed to be the oto'-
- jedt of the friends of the mint to force the
- Foreign coin into the banks, and from
r thence into the mint; but they seemed to
3 have loft fight of those parts of the country S<
, where there were no banks. There was no
s bank, he said, from Alexandria to Charles
- ton, which embraced at least one-fifth part
r , of the whole Union, yet nothing was said
; about this part of the country. the
y- law was pollivhigreat inconveniences
- ; would be experienced in tlieAj parts of the
ij country, as there are more crowns in'clrcul
, j ation thin had been supposed. As to what
3 coin had been issued from the mint, it a
i mere trifle-; it was scarcely equal to the
r expences of government, in the civil and
) military departments, for fix months.
The queition on the amendment propo
> fed by Mr. Sitgreaves being put, it was ne
, gatived without a division.
Mr. N !CÂ«plas's amendment then re
turning for Confide: n,
i Mr. Varnum thought it would be bed
to move to suspend the operation of the fe
cofid feihion of, the aft, as he had some
doubts as to the propriety of tht exprefiion
used in the resolution. "" ">
Mr. Nicholas acquiesced; and the ques
tion being put, it was carried without a di
vilion.
The committee then rofc, the House a
greed to the amendment, and a bill was or
dered to be reported.

MONDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 18.
Last Saturday night arrived from Ireland
Mr. Baxter, of this city, who left Cork on
the 28th of October, in the brig Ciiiclima
tus, (now at Reedy Island) and informs
that 3 days previous to leaving Cork, intel-1
ligence was received of the total defeat of}
the Dutch fleet. He Hates, that while the
British fleet under Admiral Duncan, were
repairing in Yarmouth Roads, (who had
left his ilation off the Tcxel for that pur
purpofe) a cutter brought hiro advice of the
Dutch -"eet being at sea, upon which the
Admiral as soon as possible went out, and
meeting the Dutch about the 17th of Oct.
they were totally defeatedâthe Dutch Rear
and Vice Admirals taken, with eight (hips
of the line; the remainder were pursued
when intelligence left the fleet. This
newsi-- without, doubt true, as, on the day
when Mr. Baxter left Cork, it,was confir
med by an express from Admiral Duncan,
which occv.lioned a royal salute to be fired
by all the (hips of war in the Cove.
Mr. Baxter has favoured us with papers
to the 12th of October, the latest brought
by the Cincinnati; they contain no news,
nor does our informant mention any intelli
gence from the Continent. (Amer. D. A.
Extraft of a letter from Â« Gentleman on his

hill, Monday the nth inft.
" I have nothing particular to add, only,
that as I parted through Dover two men fuf
fered sentence of the law, which made a
strong impression on my mindâthey were
nailed by both ears to the pillory, and cut
loose, leaving part of those naembers faft to
the wood. One of them receired thirty
nine lashes, the other, though condemned
to the fame ptuiifliment was excused by the
Executive from that part of the sentence on
supposition that he was unable to bear the
lash ; he had been previous to the trial by
some means furnifhed with a file with which
he cut off his hand cuffs, with the bar where
of he knocked down the Jailor and was mak
ing his escape, but being obftrudted by an
outer gate the Jailor came to himfelf, and in
his turn gave the Prifoncr a severe blow on
the (itk by throwing an iron wedge at him,
whi(ih laid him sprawling, and his life was at
firft despaired ofâNow my Friend, I feel
myfelf mortified that the humpn form should
be thus mutilated, but yet I do think that
cropping the ears is but a ju!t and natural
pupifhment where the offence is such as re
quires a mark to he fct on the perpetrator to
prevent Similar pradtices. The crime they
had committed was the mod atrocious that
can be committed by man against man, mur
der itfelf not excepted.

TO CAPT. MAIN WARING,
Of his Majejy's Jhip Babet.
'I sir,
â¢ Wv, the under signed mailers of Ameri
can ve.Tels, with much pain, find enifelves
under the disagreeable necessity of complain
ing of the usage we have received t and con
tinue to receive fr6m Lieutenant Mackie,
commanding Lis Majeily's sloop George.â
Immediately after his arrival in this river, he
began to impress our ffamen, some of whom
he treated extremely ill, and what has been
probably the most unpardonable part of his
conduft, he has fandlioned his men undef,
hii own eye, to plunder our veffcls and peo
ple ; of which, proof fufficient can Be giv
en.âFrom the fchoot.er BetlVy, of Balti
more, two thirds of a barrel of beef w: 8
emptied into his boat and carried away j
besides several other articles from other vt(-
fels, hams, onions, Qlver Ihoe buckles, ra
zors, looking glasses, &c. have been taken.
Firmly relyingon your goodness, as com
manding officer, we have taken the liberty
thus to state candidly to you, what wecon
fider a grievanceâand doubt not, but you
will injoin such orders as may appear proper
in this cafe. In the mean time, we conlid
er ourfelveÂ« solely under your protedion ;
and several of us mean still further to claim
it 011 the failing of the fleet, which we fond
ly hope, will not be denied ns.
We are, Sir, yours 1 ,
John APDougaU, V/illiam Patterfon, John
Compton, J. Sm'th, A. Cross.
Thi* memorial was presented by John
M'Dougal, and William|Patterfon, on board
of the Babet ; when orders was given to
hoist the signal for the officers of the sloop
George, which was immediately complied
with ; when the officers belonging to the
said (loop George, came upon deck, the
captain politely asked them and us below ;
and after having them severely reprimanded
he ordered them on board, telling them to
let lieut. Mackie know, from him, if ke
heard any more complaints'of this, that he
would, put him under arrest, and fend him
to thÂ« admiral in Martiniqueâand if you
have any Americans now on hoard, I deiire
you to deliver them up immediately.
Then addrefling himfelf to usâGentle,
men I am sorry to hear of any such com
plaintsâthe latter part of your memorial
fliall be grantfd with pleasure ; and as ma
ny cf you as will be able to get ready to
fail with the fleet, will receive your inflec
