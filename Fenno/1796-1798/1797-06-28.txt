that the several claim* be so slated/ end support- _

the neceflityof obtaining further iuiormation, or ad-

the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the (

their claims tÂ© his charge and management) that all
such claims ought in particular to fci forthâ

From Ireland.
Capt. Sprague, arrived here yejlerday from
Dublin, informs, that the spirit of Infurreclion
in Ireland continued daily to Wear a more serious
afpeftâthat a Jhort time previous to his failing,
there had embodied in the invirons of Dublin,
above 80,000 men, completely armed, whose
publicly avowed objeft, was, catholic emancipa
tionâreligious fredom, and the Independence of
Irelandâthat this body of men were encreafing
in numbers, andpraftifedjlrtft order andfubor
dinationâthat they aided and ajjijled the far
mers in gitting in their crops, intending thereby
tofecure the means of fubfiflence, when Jlrug
gting for their libertyâ-that many of the mem
bers of the IrifbparTtament, were friendly to their
cause i and that they had notified the govern
ment, that in cafe of a refufal, to grant them,
what the laws of nature and of God would
jnflify, they would apply for foreign aid, deter
mining toperifh, rather than to submit any lon
ger to drag on a flavifb and miserable txiflence
âHe further informs, that the city of Dublin
was in a eontinuedjlate of alarm andapprehen-
Jion âthat the -manufaftories were shut upâand
trade of every kind apparently annihilated.
[lt is certainly worthy of rtmark, that none of
our late London papers mention a wotd about the
situation of Ireland ; which, from the above, and
other verbal accounts received here, seems to be
" Jam tvir." There must be a little exaggeration.]
It is with pleafitre we observe, that a resolve
of the General Court, has faffed empowering
the agents for building the State-House, to pro
cure portraits of the illuflrious Governors
BOWDOIN, HANCOCK and ADAMS,
to be preferred in fame pa ft of that superb ede
fice. It is of importaince, that therefhould be,
in all States fame depository of the images of
those, whose char afters have become immortal.
How gratifying will it be to poflerity, to view
the accurate resemblances of WASHING
TON\ and his contemporary patriots, who,
together wrought the great work of their coun
try'sfalvation! While they contemplate the ven -
erablt countenances and figures of those godlike
men, their bosoms will be inspired with a glori
ous emulation to imitate their virtues, and to
perpet uatc the principles of liberty, independence,
honor and truth.
RICHMOND, june 20.
IF, (fays a Correspondent) a peace has
absolutely been fettled between France and
the Emperor, and a treaty formed on terms
advantageous to the Republic ; the dis
advantages which must result to the United
States, at the present crisis, will be incalcu
lable. The Frenph Republic, proud in.her
viftories, and powerful in her alliances, will
stop nothing short of humbling her natural
foe, Great Britain ; and so little can the
fnendihip or the enmity of the U. States
affeft that determination that D e Croix,
with some justice may declare he " will not
condescend to calculate the advantages or dijad
vantages." If, however, France discovers
ever such great benefits which might result
from the two Republics' ftrengtheriing the.
bands of friendfliip ; it is the opinion of our
political vates, that (he will be io bloated
with pride, on her acquisition of her new
ally, as obstinately to refufe the acceptance
of our Envoys ExWa. or give any other ex
planation of her motives than those she has
already adduced.

to join his colleague, Mr. Dana, at Phila

to France. Mr. Marshall was escorted 7or

with his company, the manly afpeft of the
General, appealed to yield to his natural

words to express his thanks for their po

Foreign Intelligence,
PARIS, May t.
Previous to the signing the preliminaries
of peaoe, the emperor sent to the French
general three .noblemen of the highest rank
in his court as hostages. Buonaparte re
ceived them with diftinftion, invited them
to dinner, and, during the desert, addrefTed
them thusâ" Gentlemen, you are freeâ
Tell your master, that if his imperial majefly
wants a pledge, you cannot serve for one,
and that you ought not, if none be wanted." 1
The Executive Directory have, it is said,
direfted general Buonaparte to demand the
liberty of La Fayette and his two compa
nions in misfortune-âBureau de Pufy and
Latour Maubourg, It is not to be supposed
that the hero-trf Italy, so diftinguiflied by
every noble and generous sentiment, would
have neglefted to break the chains of the
illustrious viftims of the vengeance and ty
ranny of the English government: but it is
pleasing to fee the Direftory themselves an
ticipating this aft of magnanimity and jus
tice. It is a glorious triumph of the spirit
of moderation over the fury of party.
Meflage from the Direftoiy to the council
of Five Hundred, of the 30th ult.
" We art.cagei - to dissipate by this mes
sage, the uneafiaefs created in the public
mind, and which disaffeftidn and stock-job
bing have attempted to accredit, relative to
the reality bf the preliminaries of peace corr
rcluded betweefr-jeneral Buonaparte and the
emperor's plenipotentiaries. The adjutant
general of the army of Italy, Sole, arrived
yesterday evening with the preliminary stipu
lations signed, which he delivered to the
Direftory. That officer passed through
Germany, and hostilities have ceased every
where. The baiis of these preliminaries,
approved of to-day by the Executive Direc
tory, "are, -
The cession of Belgium by the emperor
anil king.
The acknowledgerresta of the limits of
France, fnch a? they have been de
creed by the laws of the republic.
The e'ftablifhmeflt and the independence
of a republic in Lombardy.
" These moderate as well as honorable
| conditions are the guarantees of the solidity
' and duration of a peace so gloriously con
: quered by the love of liberty, the indefatiga
ble bravery of our brethren in arms, and the
! talents of the generals, who, for lix years,
' have led them to viftory."
This meflage was received by the council
of Five Hundred with the loudest plaudits.
Jean de Bry paid a just tribute of grati
tude to the peace-makers of Europe : he
expreflied the warmest wishes that the peaoe
might extend beyond the continent ; and he
concluded by moving, that the legislative
body should direst the day of the signing of
the preliminaries of peace to be a day of re
joicing.
Paftoret moved that a column should be
erefted to the brave defenders of the repub
lic in the fquareof the" great commune, with
this infeription :
La Republique reconnoiffante a fes braves
Defenfeurs.
The Republic in gratitude to her brave
Defenders.
These motions were referred to a com
miffian.
The above is a literal translation of the
meflage of the Direftory.ârWe shall now
lay before our readers, an extraft from the
Republicain Francais (one of the molt re
fpeftable of the Paris papers) which gives
more in detail the preliminary articles ; and
this intelligence, though not official, may
probably be considered as authentic. It has
been copied by all the other Paris papers.
The independence of the republic of Ba
tavia is recognised by the emperor.
The preservation, by the republic of Bel
gium and the country of Liege.
The French republic shall have, for limits,
Luxembourg, and all the territories of the
empire to the Meufe.
The emperor recognises the independence
of the republic of Lombardy. He receives
as an indemnification a part of the Terra
Firma of VeniceâVenice is to receive in ex
change the legation of Bologna and Ferrara.
There is to be a Congress at Berne, to re
gulate the definitive articles. The two pow
ers shall invite their allies to be present at
the Congress, to treat for a general peace.
Buonaparte, to the Doge of Venice.
Head-quarters, Judenberg, 20th
Germinal (April 9.)
In all the Venetian territories in Terra
Firma, the fubjefts of your government are
under arms, fcnd the rallying cry is " Death
to the French!"
The number of the soldiers of the army
of Italy, who have been their viftims,
amount already to several hundreds. In vain
you affeft todifavow those movements which
have been provoked by yourfelf. After I
have carried our arms into the heart of Ger
many, do you believe that I shall not be able
i to rriakp the firft nation in the vyorld be re
t fpefted I Do you imagine that the legion of
Italy will fuffer tamely the maffaeres which
yoti excite ? The blood of oiir brothers in
arms (hall be avenged ; and there is not a
French battalion charged with the million,
which does not feel three tifnes the courage
and ftrenglh necessary to punifli you. The
senate of Venice has returned the blackest
perfidy for the gerierofity with which we
have behaved towards it. I fend yoti my
propofyions by one of my aids-de-camp and
chief of brigadeâ-War, or Peace. If you
do not immediately take every measure ne
cessary for dispersing the banditti, if you do
not, as soon as poflible, arrest and put into
my hands the authors of the murders which
have been committed, war is declared. The
Turks are not on your frontiers ; no enemies
mfnace you; yet you have fanftioned the
premeditated dpfign of the pricfts, to form in-
I fuhrftion, & to direftit against the French.
I give you 24 hours to difpprfe them. The
) days of Charles VII. are pall. If, notwith
, ftjmdjng the good will the Freriqh govern-
I ment has fhgwu towards you, and I (hall be
1 compelled to attack you, do not, imagine
that the French soldiers, like the brigands
you have armed, will ravage the fields of the
innocent and unfortunate people of Terra
Firma. No. I shall protest them ! and they
will bless the cause which has obliged the
French army to deliver them from yoUr ty
rannical government.

aparte, may serve as an answer to this ques
tion :
i Buonaparte to the Administration of
Lombardy.
Head quarters, Scheifling,
16 Germinal, April 5.
Citizens,
You ask me to guarantee your future li
berty ! Do not the victories which the ar
my of Italy every day obtain guarantee it
fufficiently? Each of .our victories strength
ens the edefice of your constitution. Sev
eral viftoriÂ«s signalize the opening ps the
compaign, a multitude of prisoners, and
the conquest of three provinces of the Here
itary States. Are not these of more value
than any declaration of mine, since you can
not doubt -either the, interest or the strong
desire ps the French Government declare
you free and independent. Employ your- -
(elves in inftrufting and in promoting the
happiness of the people. Complete the
Legions of Lombardy and Poland. Profit; j
of the moment that the French armies occu- ,
py Italy,to render yourselves a military pow
fcr, without which you cangqÂ£ ffcure either
independence or liberty. Rely with confi- f
dence on those fentiinents of esteem ..which.-,
render me defiroua of obliging yo^i^fiidup-,
on my ardent with to concur in any thing
that can contribute to the^l^^^^^py.;
VIENNA, April 26. 'I
How much peace was wished for, even
on the part of the French, may be feeu from
the following circumftancegi eiJ l
The Neapolitan ambafi'ador, the marquis
di Gallo, general Meerfeldt, and,general
Buonaparte, met in an apartment of the pa
lace of the bilhop of Lepben, and had a lo:ig ''
conference in order to sign the preliminaries
of peace. . â¢'
In the afternoon of the 18th a number of
ftaff officers and generals of the.French.4tmy, ;
who had been invited by general Buonaparte, ;
were collected in a large hall, where they
waited the hour of dinner : they all knew
the negotiations were begun, but expected
not at all the preliminaries would be signed
that day ; after they had waited a considera
ble time! the folding doors of an anti cham- !
ber were thrown open, and Buonaparte en- :
tered with the marquis di Gallo,and. general
Meerfeldt. He shouted, " Long live the ;
emperor, long live the republic : prelimina
ries of peace are signed, long live the empe
ror, long live the republic ! !" 1
This joyful intelligence was received with 1
the loudest plaudits and testimonies of joy by
all present, which were re-echoed through
all the palace by the attendants, the ferv- ]
antr, and the soldiers. 1
The Plenipotentiaries, Generals, and of- 1
ficers, afterwards fat down to as sumptuous 1
a dinner as theplace andcircumftanc'es would
afford ; and at which the health of the Em- ]
peror, the pj-ofperity of the republic, and j1
the armies and generals on both fides, were j
dranki witti the mgft Joyful acclamations, ' t
Soon after dinner Gen. Clarke arrived, 1
and w?s received with expression of joy. 1

PORTSMOUTH, May 9. t
The Star fays, " the county quota men ]
are said to have been peculiarly aftive in the
la*e disturbances on board the fleet. .We !
cannot confirm this report; but we know :
that to the unwise measures of these assess- f
ments, we are to impute the origin of the 1
commotions. The able seamen who had j
fcrved through the whole war, and who had c
originally received 51. of bounty, saw a set
of men, raw, ignorant, in some inftapces '<â 
old, in others mere boys, many of them in
ill health, come on board with 30, 40, or 1
even jol. bounty money in their pockets, r
and these men could neither take their share J
of duty in the tops, nor ease the toil of the 1 1
veteran. In several instances they saw them , t
desert to return again with a second bounty, j f
Nay, they have seen them return with a fe- c
cond 40 or 501. "after being discharged as f
unfit for service. This galled the genuine r
seamen, and to this more than to any other c
cause, may be ascribed the confederacy for f
the rife of wages." 1
Intelligence has been received at Copen- "c

HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES,
uI " ... Saturday, June 24.
Mrs 'Otis presented a petition from Sa
muel Moore, deputy colleftor of revenue at"
Boston, praying to be excused from the
payment of upwards of 2,000 dollars, 'the
| prop erty of the United States, of which he
had -been robbed upon the highway. Or
-1 derea to lie"on the table.
Mr. Gallatin presented iwo petitions,
fOne from persons in the vicinity of the 0-
hio, complaining of the deficiency in the
, quantity (jfland purchased from the Unl'te<J
States ; the other from upwards of 100 per-
Jans in the fame-quarter, complaining that
, the ywere not able to become purchasers at
the United States sale, from the
of fpecnlators.. Referred to' the Secretary
of the Mreafury. J
Mr. J. Smjth frpm the committee of
revifal and unfinifhed business, made a re
port of expiring laws ; the committee also
exprefied a doubt whether the aft passed
. last fefiion for fixing the next meeting of
'Congress on the firft of November, was not
fuperceded by the prelent extraoVdinary
; meeting.
A committee was appointed to report a
; bill <?n the fubjeft of expiring laws, but
; Mr. Sitgreaves thought it
to appoint a committee on the fubjeft of the
laW for fixing the next meeting of Congtefs,
38 he did not think the present extra meet
ing could affeft that law, since it was the
provinceof the Prelident to call extra sessions
|of Congress ; but it was the business of
Congress to fix the annual meetings, and
" that the two powers could not be
allowed to infringe upon each other.
Mr. W. Smith differed in opinion, and
wished the report to lie upon the table, or a
committee to be appointed to concur with
the Senate.
A committee ofconference was appointed.
Mr. Blount, from the committee ap
pointed to report on the fefolution proposing
to purchase arms, reported it as their opi
nion, that the fubjeft should lie over till the
next fefiion.
Mr. W. Smith thought the fubjeft im
portant, and wished the report to lie on the
| table. It lay of course.
i The bill for providing for the proteftion
s of the Commerce of the United States was
read the tKird time, and the blank for filling
up the number of men to be employed in
the cutters, was filled up with thirty ; on
the question being about to be put on the
palling 'of the bill,
Mr. "Nicholas, said some statements
!iad r been received from the War Depart meat
and ordered to be printed. He had -not
seen a copy of them, but wasinformed there
was.yet wanting 197,000 dollars to com
plete the frigates. He Willed information
on the fubjeft.
Mr. Parker read an extraft fralri the
account,which bad been printed.
Mr. Nicholas wished to knotv how it
happened that in four months so great a
mistake could have happened as to the ex
' pence of finifhing these vefiels. When the
| last appropriation of 170,000 dollars was
made, they were told that sum would be fuf
ficient to make them fit to receive the men
on board;, but now they were called upon
for 197,000 dollars more. He thought this
matter ought not to pais over without en
â¢ quiry, as he did not like to be f.awn from
step to step to do what, if the whole matter
had Dean feeri at firft, they might pot have
"consented to.. He.trusted this Was not in
tentionally done ; but he owned it looked
very suspicious.
Mr. Parker believed the estimate of last
fefiion was only to make the Vessels readj to
receive the guns op board, and did not in
clude the guns.. Mr. Gallatin Â£aM,_aa lie meant to vote. kno'
against the passing of the bill, he would had
briefly state his reasons for dpiiji so. He largÂ«
knew only of two arguments in favour of her
the, bill ; the firft, that irwas. necefljiry du- Frar
ring a t-'m'e of peace, to lay the foundation in ft
of a navy ; the other was, that the frigates cont
being built, it. would be proper to man them, den
As to the-propriety of haying a navy, he ed g
did not mean to go generally into , tfie sub- coil
jeÂ£t, but he would make a few obfervatipns few
as to our situation for engaging in an efta- prot
blilhinent of this kind. Suppose that navies out
were neceflary in European nations to in- that
crease their power or to protest their com- IN
meree, rhefe confiderati'ons did not apply ufec
to our present circumstances. In order to gat<
prove this, it was only neceflary to take a to a
view of our revenue, and the expences of a une
fleet: *â¢ ma j
The amount of revenue, from the firft t>f was
April, 1796, to the firft of April, 1797, the
received into the Treasury, was 7,400,000 thi
dollarsâa sum which by farexceeded that of bill
any former year, and he did not think that fide
the permanent revenue of the United States woi
could be well extended beyond that sum. Pre
For inftatice he did not think that nine thii
millions could be raised from the people tha
without oppression. Indeed, by the best fat;
calculations .on the quantity of circulating ma
medium in the country, it was not allowed wo
to exceed eight millions, and he did not be- Fo
lieve that any nation could ra'ife a larger sum mo
in taxes than was equal to the amount of thr
their circulating specie. of
He should therefore vote against this bill,:; the
because he did not believe we could raise re- bil'
venue equal to the expense of fupportiog a f jeÂ£
fleet.; for, although we had a large capital he
in land, we had but a small quantity of cir-, he
culating medium, and from our scatter *1 110
situation", that medium circulated much gh
flower than .in smaller compaft countries ; thi
and it must be allowed that the quantity of th<
revenue which cquld be raised depended on do
the amount of circulating medium. ufi
In order to (hew what the expense of a
navy might be expefted to be, Mr. G. made th
the following statement of the cost of our an
three frigates : to
Dolls. Cts. w;

* Iji M a r ch 1 797' 172,000 dollars were
{kid .to be fufficient so complete the three
frigates. In June 1797, it is officially stated
that exejufively of money requisite for guns
and military stores, 126,645 dollars are
wanted for the fame purpose, viz. that of
completing the three frigates ; therefore, no
security that the sum now afkedwill be found
fufficient.
' Thi? statement shewed, Mr. Gallatin said,
that these frigates had cost about 2,0e01.
sterling a gun, though the common calcula
tion, in Great Britain, was only half that
sum. If from building the frigates, they
turned tb the expence of manning them, the
fame conclusion would be drawn. They
found that the pay of an able bodied seaman
in the Britifli navy, had lately been raised
from 26/6 to 30/0 sterling a month, which
was 6 a-2ds dollars ; but by the present
law, 15,000 dollars a month were allowed
for the pay of the petty officers, midship
men, seamen, ordinary seamen and marines,
which averaged from 16 to a man.
When he heard gentlemen stating the
advantages of the naval strength of Denmark
and Sweden to those countries, he could not
agree with them altogether, tho' he agreed
they bad force weight; but it was well
known, that the grand navy of Portugal i JV
had ,no weight whatever in the scale of the J last '
large navies of. Europe; it did nrtt even enable tho'
her to pro.test, her trade : for if either the!
France or Great Britain had the fuperiorit'y and
in the Mediterranean, (he w'a'3 under their I fhoi
controul. He believed Denmark and Swe- I and
den had 30 fail of the line each, and he wish- I milt
ed gentlemen to calculate how much it would I evil
cost us to have fych a navy. A fleet of a I lay
few veflels would not theft be able to afford I cou
proteftion to our trade ; and it was wholly I put
out of our power to a fleet equal to I sea,
that of Denmark tfr Sweden. I ed
Mr. G. went to the second argument | cor
used for passing this bill, viz. that the sri- j veri
gates being now built, it would be proper 1 was
to arm'them. Hie believed the bill to be as I con
unexceptionable and harmless as they could | He
make it, and.the only objeftion he had to it ver
: was the expence. If we were to have war, J nav
the frigates being built, he should certainly j dei
1 think it neceflary to man them ; and if the | ant
F bill went no farther than to enable the Pre- I th<
: fident to man them, in cafe of a war, he I me
5 would vote for it; but it authorised the jin
- Prelident to man them, when he ' should J an
: think it expedient, and as he had told them J ins
* that they and other veflels were now necef- I m<
t faty, he'doubted not he would proceed to I mt
r man them immediately, which he thought j wi
1 would be incurring an unnecessary expence. I ga
- For, if there were a declaration of war to- I be
i morrow, more men would be obtained in I
f three weeks, than there would be in a state I do
of peace in three months ; he therefore j th
;>/; thought it would be proper to rejeft the j pa
- bill, though he had no hopes it would be re- 1 th
a | jested. During the present fefiion, he said, I fe'
11 â¢ he had voted for a number of things which I th
â¢-! he did not think neceflary, but which were I of
d : not calculated to do any harm. He would Ift
h gladly have done the fame with refpeft to |
; this ; but he could not reconcile himfelf to j w
if the additional expence of half a million of fp
n dollars, for a purpose which could be of no bi
use except in cafe of war. h<
a M. Swanwick believed the expence of w
le these frigates had oeen much greater than fu
ir any future ones, would be. When they were 31
told they had cost 20001. fterHng a gun, it hi
s. was evident there must have been great ex- I
travagance in the expence, as merchants | di
veflels might be built as cheaply in this 1 P'
country as in any .other. He supposed the Ii
extra expence had been owing to the want la
of some regular establishment to overlook tl
the business, and because it had been under-1 p
12 taken at a time when other nations were attic
war, and of coiirfe when materials were ve- w
ry high. Sixteen thousand dollars worth I
of hemp had indeed been burift by accident P
at Bolton. As to the terms of seamen I r
tho* they might at firft be high, when the l b
32 service was known, he doubted not they .1 g
would fall. I n
But it was said a small naval force would I c
be of no use to us. He thought it would 0
be of great use, from our contiguity to the I i
82 Weftlndies ; as, in cafe of hostilities com- I c
mitted upon us by any Europeon power, I t
we might at once fall upon their rich poflef- I
fions in that quarter. Our experience in I v
â  this war,-he said, had proved the use that I 1
such a fleet would be of to us. Indeed, I 1
the French had frequently charged us with 1 a
not protecting our trade, and seemed to re- I 1
primand us for our weakness. And, when I ]
they heard of small row-boats taking our t
merchant veflels, did not every man wish for
a small naval force to protest our trade ? I '
He trusted they did ; and these veflels would ,1
be of great use in this way. Besides, Mr. I
S. said, can any gentleman believe that the I
European powers will be able to keep up
82 1 their present enormous naval establishments I'
I for any lengh of time ? He did not believe I
48 they could. Mr. S. did not think because I'
j our circulating specie was not more than I
i eight millions, that our taxes could not ex-1
30 . that sum ; as, besides specie, there was I
I a large quantity of bank paper. Nobody I
would believe that the circulating specie of I
Great Britain amounted tb twenty-five mil I
lions ; yet their annual taxes Were to that I
amount. Tn England he knew the use of a I
paper medium had been greatly abused ; I
but the abuse of a thing could not argue I
against the use of it.
Mr. S. was firmly of opinion that, in the j
course of time, this country must become a I
great maritime power ; and he doubtod not I
that in time of general peace, armed ships I
would be built for half the price which they I
had cost.
He hoped, therefore, when his colleague I
had obtained his wish (in which he had wil-1
lingly concurred with him) in reftrifting the I
use of the â¢ veflels, he would not now vote
againu the passing of the bill.
1 Mr. J. Williams said, he had always op- I
posed the establishment of a uavy ; and was I
1 the question now, whether or not we should
\commence a navy, he should certainly be
> against it; but, as the frigates were so far
were advanced, he thought they ought to finifh
hree them, especially when they confidfred the
:ated present critical situation of our affairs ; for,
guns if a general peace did not take place in Eu
are rope, the war would probably become a ma
it of ritime war, and we might be involved in it.
e, no But, he was still of opinion, that if we must
ound go into an expensive naval establishment for
the proteftion of our commerce, we had
said, better have none. But, fay gentlemen,â
3col. where will you find revenue ? He believed,
cula- though we had no armed force, a confidera
:that ble commerce would still be carried on, and
they those who decline it, would turn their atten
, the tion to agriculture and manufafteres, from
rhey which any deficiency of revenue would rea
aman dily be supplied.
â¢aifed It was true, as had beeu stated, that they
idiich had been called npon from time to time for
efent additional sums to complete those frigates,
owed and he knew not when these calls would end.
Ifhip- Mr. Williams went into a calculation of
rines, the expence of -these veflels, and compared
man. the situation of this country with Europe,
â - the and concluded that it would be our best po
mark licy to stand aloof from all foreign powers,
id not He would however, go so far for the pro
greed teftion of our corn'mere as the building of
> well fix frigates: Furtherhe should not chufe to go.
Mr. Giles "'as obliged to the g^Reiiviii
last up for his fpssch against the prefer]t bill, J' '
tho' he meant to vote for' it; lie would ra
ther, however, that he had fpktn in favour, vot
and voted against the bill. Mr. G. said he of]
fhpuld vote : against the passing of the b;ll, to
and for the reasons assigned by that gentle- **ia
man. H,e thought a navy would be a' great '
evil for this country. Our great interests
lay in- the foil; and if ever the vitals of the q
country were tof be drawn together for the na ,
purpose of.pro'tefting our commerce on the of
sea, he (hould greatly lament it. He believ
ed the despotism of nations-kept pace ac- r
cording to the ratio of expeoce of their go- ex l
vernments. He was sorry to fay that he
was more and more convinced that it was the nO ,
conftaiU aim of some gentlemen in that yo
House tb inereafe the expences of olir go- th<
vemment. The propriety of establishing a w:
navy had scarcely ever been seriously eonfl
dered ; it was tirft begun Under an alarm, w *
and it had been continually carried on by
the-fame rae?tns. Mr. G. adverted to the ft,,
methods employed to raise men by prejfmg of
in all count I'ies where navies were eftablilhed, tei
and insisted that navies. and prejf-gangs were
inseparable ; for, said he, tlie wages of sea
men are now 30 dollars a month, and v;hen Â°
men are wanted for the frigates, the price I
will doubtlefe be increased, and tjieprejjf- ha
gang must be resorted to, 01- the navy must tic
be abandoned. I fh

pen, except within mir own jurifdiftion, where '
s could be of advantage to us ; but
notwithilanding this was his opinion, he {hould g (
vote for the palling of this biH, because he saw ( - c
the sentiment of that house and of the publit
was fttoiigly in its fav>r, from a pei-fuafion that er
the measure was necessary, and that the thing j e
would be a continual topic of dispute until.it
was carried into effeiSl.
He was willing, therefore, that the ve fie Is j )Â£
(hould go to sea, believing that nothing short ,- e:
of ailual experience weuld convince the firppor- at
ters of this measure that it was nfelefs, expen- âf
five and injurious ; and hoping that one year's
experience of the plaything, finding money was (j,
of greater value than the frigates, all parties c h
| would concur in the relinquithing it. re
Mr. Sewall said, that the argoments which
hid been used against this bill for the protec
tion of the trade of the United States, went to
(hew that commerce was useless aud that the
I prote<slion of it would be expenlive beyond any
I profit which could be derived from it ; and fame
I wild voted for the parting ofihebill, did it from
the prolefled motive of giving the thine a trial, .
I that it might afterwards be abondnned. Gen- V
tlemen who depended upon agrictikine fur.c\Fe- Â°\
ry thing, lie said, need not put themselves Â£ft ei

HARTFORD, June 26.
The public have been much pleased late
ly to find by the newspapers, that the ra
tional and pious praftice" of duelling has at
length obtained a footing ib Congress, and
that it meets with such countenance from
the members. A year or two ago, Mr.
Gunrt, of the Senate, challenged Mr. Bald
win, of the House of Representatives. Mr.
Baldwin declined, undoubtedly in compli
ance with the stern dictates of the old reli
gious "notions which he imbibed during the
time of his prfrachfng. The house made
a great-uproar at that time, on account of
their privilege's, dignity, &c. and, probably,
as Mr. N Baldwin was a very fuperftitioufly
piouÂ»: Jnan, his cpnfeiepoe forbade him to
fight, however much his flefh might have
desired it. In the late instance, Mr. Blount
.has aftedmore wifely", by challenging a lay
man, and congress seem to applaud his con
duct by silent.testimony at least. And as it
may now be considered as compatible with
'the duty of the members of the highest le
, giflative body in the United States, to fight
â¢ duels, or at least to challenge each other, it
' is devoutly expected by the people at large,
especially in the eastern states, that for the
future, all queftiotis may be fettled in this
- amicable way. This plan will give our
southern brethren an advantage, which they
are entitled to from their superior patriotism
âAÂ» they are the bpft marklnjen, theypro
babjy will thin ojf the northern members, so as
) to-fscHfjiJUi; fhemfehes fhartly a decided majori
