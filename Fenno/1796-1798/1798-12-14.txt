e TO THE PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA.
Fellow Citizen,
IT was my intention to have confined my
remarks to the objections contained in the re
monllranee proposed in Albernntrlc. Though
I have noticed them all, yet as ftnne others
have been made in other parts of the lUte a
yainft the Alien Law, before I conclude, a
few observations lhallbe offered on them. In
4 the Hanover and Fredericfburgh relulutfons
the Alien Law is impeached of unconftitu
tionality, for uniting in the President, Le
giilative, Executive and Judicial power, and
for depriving persons within the protection
of government of a public and impartial trial
j by jury. That an alien friend, who has
committed a crime within the territory of
's the United States, is a person within the fe
vsnth article of the amendment of the a
mendments of the confkitution, and entitled
to a trial by jury, is not to be controverted.
But the alien law does, not apply to aliens
n who have committed offences, but to thole
1 who have not committed offences, but who
are fufpefted of intending to commit them.
It is. to prevent the eo rami Aon of crimes that
the Prelident is authorised to order them out
of our country, before the crimes are com
mitted. Every sovereign potver I'urelT may
take measures to prevent crimes from being
done it by aliens, and may admit them
into its territory, or for good cailfe order
them out after they come into it. Thus
then the law does not operate to deprive of
fenders of a trial by jury. . .
For the execution of this law, it was re
auilite to declare how, and by wliom, it
IhoUld be done ; and no where could it be
placed so fafe from abufs as in the lupreme
executive, appointed by the constitution. It
is a tranfa&ion in its nature executive, and
unmixed with legislative or judicial power.
Without any law it may be cjueflioned whe
ther it was not a proper function exe
cutive power to order out of the country so
- reigners who are pursuing projects dangerous
to the peace and welfare of the citizens, be
fore such projetts are carried into effect. By
9 l'ome department in government such acts
. ought to be done. The judges are po fie (Ted
] only of judicial power, and only declare
I what the law is, therefore removal of aliens is
an aft out of the power of them, and if done
3 J at all, must be (lone by the executive author
-0 *Â«y- â¢â
It is idle to fay that each state fhouldexer
cife the power*of removing aliens. A state
can only remove out of its own limits, there
ffate, alien was lent out of one
. o s** â "* v â¢"wtntTj W 1
; permit him to remain there. An
1.1 dered out of Virginia might go to Conner,
j ticutâLpon this fubjeft there must beanu
; nion of action of all the states, or it is useÂ»
let's ; and therefore it ought to be done un
der the constitution of the United States,
which was formed to obtain an union of ac
tion upon certain subjects, and contains cer
tain powers far those ends, which, especial
ly, comprehends our concerns with foreign
nations, and requires " the United States to
protect each state from invasion and domes
tic violence." The intimate connexion be
tween a foreign ihvafion and therefider.ee of
aliens dnpofed to join the standard of the in
vaders whenever it (hall he eredled on our
land, has been fully explained as well as I
am able, and it need not be repeated.
lhe claui'e in the constitution which pro
rides " that the migration or importation of
f luch perlons as any et the states now existing
Uiall think proper to admit, (hall not be pro
hibited by congress prior to the year t8o8,"
has been altedged to be violated by the alien
, law * II 15 well known that this clause was
j meant to comprehend slaves though the
f terms are more general. The convention had
a dehcacy vfth refped to a word which
would, in their opinion, have diforaced the
Â» conftitutioÃ, and therefore this vague ex
-3 P rc ffiÂ° n was used. That it does not allude
j to : a ir eemen is apparent, from the single
. consideration that the restraint is limited to
j a few years. Is there any good reason that
1 congress liquid be prohibited till the year
1 1808 from hindering the migration of free
> aliens, which would not have contimu-d the
prohibition beyond that period, and perhaps
always ? 1 he truth is, the migration of lkves
into a state is a thing left to the controul and
direction ol each state until the year 1808,
1 nO ,! 0 v nger 5 after whicb period that fub
jea will be under the excluiive' authority of
the federal government.
To con fide r this objeaion in another
point of view, if, after the year 1808, con
gress will have an undouhted power to pro
m*Â£ration of free aliens fnto the
territories of the United States, or of fend
uig them out, if dangerous to our peace,
what (olid reason ean be givin whv the like
power should not be at this day exerciibd ?
No such reason, 1 venture to fay, has ever yet
been given, either in speeches on the floor of
congress, or in remonstrances, or in resolu
tions, proposed in Virginia. If none such
can be found, I think it a firong argument
agamft the interpolation that has been f U R
gefted of this clause of the conftitutlon in
fit rogation of the power of the United States
over aliens.
The investigation which I proposed may
tÂ»ow be concluded. I have fuffered no ob
jeftion to either of these laws to go unno
ticed upon which any reliance seems to be
plnced. I have endeavoured to answer all
of them, separately and diftinclly. In doing
this, I hare particularly aimed at perfpieuitv:
I am sure the laws have not been under
stood, and to make them intelligible, I con
udered tlje bell mode of juftifying them
thfm but be undcrftood as they really
'
' are, and I have perfnaded niyfelf to believ?
that you "will think them conftitntionaL,
and respecting their neceflity or expediency,
that you will confide in the wifdoni and pa
triotism of the national legislature, the fu.
premet councils of our countiy, to whom by
our free fuffra;;es are committed our political
existence and l'afety ; and with these, our
dearest interests of property, of liberty, and
of life.
Let us not listen to the agitators IcattereJ
through the country, busy in deceiving, busy
in alarming, busy in exciting the people a
gainst their own laws and their own law,
givers. Let us riot be misguided by men',
whose judgments and whose hearts are not
more to be trusted than our Own. Let us
not be arrayed in a bodyâThe Common
wealth of Virginia, agairift the United States
ot America.âl fee no other point at which
the men mean to stop, who underfland and
I patronize the Hanover resolutions, the Fr
dericklburg reiolutions, or Albemarle re
monstrance. They breathe no other spirit
but that of infurredlion ; and to'give it con
liftencv and efficacy, our state legislature, at
the ensuing session in the next month, is to
be called upon to obtain the repeal of ti i
I alien and fcdition laws. A war of words s
- then to be commenced by our commonweal b
i against the United States. If words will
not prevail on congrels* to repeal the lav,
which every confide rate man mull expert to
be the result, what is Virginia next to do ?
She must either r.-treat with ignominy, or
â  more dishonorably rebel against the "Union.
Are we prepared for such an alternative ?
1 o you 1 submit the cjuefl'ion : your good
lenfe has detested the inMous a'nd wicked
i machinations of the faftious, and the ia-
I mentable errors of the rrtifmformed and de
ludedâ.your love of counwy will answer,
that such stall not be the deplorable 'aHe of

NORFOLK, December 6.
i Yesterday arrived here the schooner Swa!Â»
o W ' C i pt " L Â°S an > ( in distress) 18 days from
Cape Franco's In her came paflenger Mr.
Jacob Mayer, Consul of the United States
for that place, accompanied by a French
gentleman, who, we liavte reason to believe,
â¢ is the bearer of important dispatches from
, General Touflaint to the Executive of this
country. We learn by this arrival that eve
: ; nr thing was tranquil throughout the island,
and that the crops bore a very promiling
appearance.
| 1 yesterday also arrived the American brig
; Elizabeth, from Malaga, via. Gibraltar*
53 days.
On Sunday last. 7 leagues to the south
ward of Cape Henry, spoke the United
[ States (loop of war Herald, having in cqm
j pany the Montezuma floopef war, the brig
Norfolk, and schooner Retaliation, ail cn a
, cruize, they were fleering to the south.
I ward.
1 By gentlemen, paflengers in the above
brig, we are informed, that there are up
. I wards of 100 French privateers cruidaa he.
; I yyc ae oat ansi Cape Spartel; they
mount from 8 to ,6 guns, are well manned,
and are fitted ,n the Spanilh ports, for the
purpo.e of capturing Americans. Six or
seven pr.vateers were expressly fitted eut to
capture the American Meditsrranean fleet
but their designs were fruflrated by the A*
merican vessels being well armed keeping
clofe together. . r *
At the time they left Gibraltar (the Bth
October) a secret expedition was preparine:
it was to confilt of a itrong.aa.al force, and
3000 seasoned troops ; the rumours refpefi
iog its destination were various, but general
ly supposed agai'nft Minorca.
They had received no account from ad
miral Nelson since the arrival of the Mutiae
brig ; but expefted the prize foip, there the
hrfl wmd. she Britifl, fleet, it was uader
itood, would put into Candia to refit.
Mr. Jacob Mayer, consul of the United
States for St. Domingo, arrived in tbe Swal
low, on hy way to tne feat of government,
accompanied by a French gentlemen.
Capt. Logan informs us, that the priva
teers had ce>fed to bring in American ves
sels, on account of new orders brought out
by an armed ship from France. There was

His Excellency John Sevier, Governor of

treated with haughty and unparalleled cob
tempf, how pleating and highly gratifying
muli it be to a provoked and greatly injured
country, when informed ef the gallant aad
soldiery preparations now making by the
volunteer and other companies of cavalry,
in the slate of Teneflee. The cavalry in
their answer observe, that " the citizens of
the weftem world are not divided in their

in government, and we are willing t*
step forth in defence of ovr countiy, ihouli

been displayed. Mr. J. Taylor, of Caro

Pri mskxt of the Unitkd States,
sik,
THE Houle of RcprelVntatives unite
with you in dcplorSij the e(T; As of the defo-
malady by which the {est of govern
ment ami other parts of our country have
recently been vifitsd. In calling our atten
tion to the fatality of its repeated ravages,
and inviting us to cocCJer the expediency of
exercising our conftitutiona! powers in aid of
the liealth laws of thi refpefttve dates, your
recnniinendation is finftioned by the dictates
oÂ£ humanity and liberal policy. On this in
terefling- fubjed, we feel the neceility of a
dopong evi'iy wife expedient for preventing
'< calamity l'o diftrefling to individual fuffer
i-rs and so prejudicial to our national com
merce.
That our finances are in a profperout fhte
notwithft inding the
refuking front this calamity and from ex
ternal embarraflYnpnt'i, is a latisfai\ory maiii
reftat;f>n of the great' extent and solidity of
1 t.ie refourcts. Conne'dlsd With' tEis
I situ atiofi of our filial concerns, the all'ur'- I
j ance, that the legal proviuoris for obtaining
j ivvenuc by direct taxation will fulfil the views
"f the legillature, is peculiarly acceptabl â¢.
D:Grous as we are that all causes of hos
tility may be remold by the amicable adjuft
â¢aent of national differences, we learn witli

proclaims a predatory warfare against
t!ie uoqueftionablc rights of neutral com
merce ; which, with ouj* means jdÂ£ defence,
our interest and our honor command .us to re
pel. It, therefore, now beconies the.United
states to be as determined Kirefidanoe as thtv
haÂ»e been patient in and coittlefcen

\\ hile those who affairs of France
perlift in the enforcement of decrees lot hostile
to our etiential rights, their condudjt.forbids
us to confide in any of their profefEons of
amity.
As, therefore, the of France hither
to exhibits nothing which ought to change
or relax our nieafures of defence, the policy
of extending and invigorating those measures
demands our sedulous attention. The sud
den ajid remarkable advantages, which this
country has exijertenced from a small naval
armament, fmHciently prove the utility of
its eftablifinnent. As it the guarding
of ourcoaft, the protection of our trade, and
the facility of fafely transporting tlie means/
or territorial defence to every part of our
maritime frontier, an adequate naval, .force
mull be considered as an important objeft of
national policy. Nordo we hefitatp to adopt
tlie opinion, that, whether negotiations with
ranee are rcfumed or not, vigorous prepara
tions for war will be alike indispensable.
In this conjuncture of affair.?, while with
you we recognize our abundant cauie-of gra
ituds to the Supifine Dil'pofer of events for
.he ordinary bletfings of Providence, we re
<ard, as ot high national importance, the ma
mfeftation, in our country, of a maguani

mn. This fpirk merits to be rfierllhed and
"ivi-rorated, by every branch of government,

GENTLEMEN,
MY sincere acknowledgments are
due to the House of Representatives of tKe
United States, for this excellent address, so
confonaot to the charadler of representatives
of a great and free people. The judgment
and feelings of a nation I believe were ne
ver mare truly expressed by their reprcfesta
tivea, than those of our coÃftituents, by
your decided dfclaration, that with our
means rf defence, our interest ai d honor
command us to repel a predatory warfare
againfl the unqoeftioutble rights of nrutral
; commerceâThat it becomes tbc United
1 States to be as determined in refiltanee as
i they ha"e been patient in ludtring and con
dercendiog.innegociat.onâThat whilethofe .
I who direfl'the affairs of France perfiil in. !
the enforcement of dectees, so hostile to our !
essential ights, their conduit forbids u<; to â¢
confide ifl arty of thtir profeffiops of amity, â 
that an adequate naval force muH beconfid- '
eredas an impcrtantobjeft ofna'ional policy,
and that whether negoci*iians with France â 
are resumed or not, vigorous preparatioos
for war, will be alike indispensable.
The generous disdain you so coolly and '
deliberately express, of a reliance on foreign
proteftion, wanting no foreign .guarantee j
of our liberties, revolving to maintain our
natioual independence againfl every attempt ,
to dispoil us of this ioeftimable tteafure, '
will meet the full approbation of every fouud (
understanding, and exulting appiaufea from
the heart of every faithful American.
I thank you, Gentlemen, for your can
did approbation of my sentiments on the
subject of negociation, and for the de
claration of your opinion, that the policy
of extending and iuv ; gnrating our mea
sures of defence, and the adoption with
prudent forefight, such fyftimatical mea
sures as may be expedient for calling
forth the energies of our country, wherever
the national exigencies may require, whe
ther*on the ocean, or on our own territory,
will demand your raolt sedulous attention.
At the fame time I take the liberty to as
sure you, it shall be my vigilant endeavour,
that no illusory profeffions (hall seduce me in
to an abandonment of the rights which be
long to the United States, as a free and in
dependent nation.
JOHN ADAMS.
United States, Dec. 14, 1798.
Dodor Logan, it is said, was so morti
fied with the reception which M. Talley
rand gave him, as to return home, with a
very indifferent opinion of that miniftertk
talents !âOn being introduced to him,
Talleyrand observed that he had the pka
fure of knowing him in America, and asked
him, if he was'nt a distinguished farmer <jf
Pennfylv<nia ?âThe doftor answered, that
" he was very fe-d of farming, and ha|d
made it the pleasure of hia life.Oh
then, replisd l-alleyrand, I will introduce
you to a citiren' near Paris, with whcife
fpeculationi on that fubjedt I am furÂ«, you
will be delighted"âand then left the doctor
snd Merlin, his favorite, to their own medi
tations. This 40.ecdote, related by the il
legitimate envoy himfelf, ia a proof that,
even among our enemies, the ignoran* pre
tenflons of this fellow, are dt fpifed by mep
of sense, and that Talleyrand, who is con
feffedly a scholar and an arch politician,
thought that the'd ftor had much better
employ his time in studying the vegetation
of potatoes, than in attempting to mediate
between two governments.
The French prifouers were removed from
New-Caftlc for Lancaller 011 Saturday last.
The picaroon which the United States
frigate came up with, after twelve hours
chafe, was the fleeteft vefTel in the Weft-
Indies, always out failing the British prui
zers.
The British naval officers in the Weft In
dies, wet,- highly pleased on the appearance
of the United States frigate, &c. in those
latitudes ; and the Commodore at Martinico,
regretted, that when the United States.
Commodore Barry pass d the Island, he did
not honor hith with a visit. Captain Barry
be ng in chafe of one of Hugue's picaroons,
called " Victor's Delight," could not pay
the visit wished, but fer.t a polite letter to
Sir Hyde Parktr, from St. Thomas's on
the fubjett.
The follow we are told, it an accu
rate calculation of the didribution of the
prize money refuliing from Admiral Nel

one eight ii goes to the Flag Officers, viz
one third of the eighth to the commauder

For puUi/ling hy fubfeription ,a ftriotCral a ori
to be entitled Ibe Philadelphia Magazine
and Review ; or, Monthly Repertory of
Information and Amusement,
\ FTER the many fruitlefs attempt*, which
i have been m.vliÂ» to eftabhfli a publication
of this kind-in Phil.yjrtph : i, the pmpolab
: fiibmitlert, wi'i, perhaps, itfirft r.-ht; .i , rfl r te
I bewothmg more than lblieittii* dujjpo'r.riner.t
: hen, however, we oMerve an rap r lcarch
. alter knowledge fpreadm* through aii parts of
our eoÃutrj, an-1 when we eonfider, that, itÂ»
i theie pursuits. AJagn-zitres and are t f
univc; ially-admitted utility, we are led to be
lieve, that lormer undertakings in this way have
; failed from some oth. r eaule than the want of
oilcerument or liberality in those, to whom the
I fcditors looked up for support.
From causes, which are too evident to need
' n '""7 ,ti . l, e here, America is, and long mull be
beholden in a very cooOderable degree, to the
: prelTss of Great Britain. The literature of the
i countries ij, indeed, a f.rt of common
I Hock ; but, for one publication of oun, vc re
cede, at lead five hundred in return While
! 'his is the cafe, it is extreme Jolly in the pub!.fli
er of a periodical work, to rejeil, from a lort of
fpunous patriotism, ail information, however
ulsful, and all amulement, heweverdelightlome,
merely because it iÂ» not of native pmdn&ron.
Obvious, however, as the jullice of these re
marks niuft appear we have very little doubt in
our minds, that an ohftinate adherence to a con
trary notion has been the principal cause of the
want of luccefs, experienced by those who have
gone before us.
Reason and interest unite in dictating tout a
d fferent plan. The Mifcellanecus part, and
principal part, therefore, of the Philadelphia
Magazine, will confiftof choice feleflioni from
the newest publications of merit, that lhall ap
pear in Europe ; but, particularly from the va
rious periodical works published in Great-Bri
tain, of which we have taken care tÂ» iafure the
very earliest supply. At the fame time, we trust
it is umneceflary to f,y, that we lhall always re
ceive with pleasure any original productions of
genius, in verfeor prole, of our, owÂ»eotmtÂ»y ;
and we flattar Â«i*rfclvc* with tlfco hope of Kc,nÂ£
oftea favoured with the agreeable talk of giving
'to such produAions merited praises and cxten
five publicity.
In fetching and arrangiup these materials, to
suit the various tastes of our readers, we are sen
sible how difficult a talk we have undertaken.
Topleale all, we do not expe& : it would be a
vaift preemption. But we are refolded to give
offem'e to none, so far as fonfllts with the fipe
rtVr rtfjietfl wc owe to the sacred cause of rHi
pfon, morality, and facial order. In thife are
involved the glory ami welfare of our'country,
and they will ilways he the PoUr-star, that lhall
guide our ltboi-s.
The Mifcellar.y will be followed by a month
ly Summny nf hewj and politics, foreign as
well as domcllici under wkich Head wij be
comprised i fuccinfl account of the ProcteJmgi
of th: General em,l Suite l.eg'Jtatves, and the
titles at lead, of all the law, they lhall eniA.
The next part of our undertaking, is a Re-
I'ieio, of the principal works of note pubt'fhrd
in flreat-Brifa n. Forthis we tnufl necelHtrily
havefecoutfs to the Kevicws of that country.
Though it will he impoffihle Cpr us to furnilh at
complete an analysis is that.fom wliich we. (hall
take our materials, we (hall not fail to give such
an account of e-uery publication reviewed in that
country, as will c nvey to otir rraders informa
tion fufilcient to enable them toavjilthemfe|ves
at a very eirly ((age, of e -rry valuable pi-rfnrm
ancs thit (lull appear. The advantages ariling
from futh information jr# evident. For want
of it otir profefliona! msn an 1 men of tafle are
always krtiT a yeur or two in thÂ» rear of those
of Great-Britaiij. We do not hear of a work
tjll a long time after it is published, jnd many
very valuable ones we never heir of at all. All
â¢he Vartoti* fnjuries and privations we fuffer
from thjf fourcc will, wc flatter ourselves, t.c
entirely done away by z fltjdy adherence to our
plan.
To that of foreign, will b:: added a Review of
Dome/lie Publications ; and btrt, we miiftcon.
fels, that we feel fotne difli lence, beeaufe the
execution of the talk mull depend, in a great
mejftire,' upon the abilities of ourfrlves. Ho v
ever, with s firm resolution to he guided by de- I
cency, candour, jnd truth, and tÂ® take genius
and viitue bv the hand, whenever, atid in what
