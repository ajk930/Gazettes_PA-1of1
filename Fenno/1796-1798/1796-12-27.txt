TO THE PUBLIC.
nd THE caution introduced into the public prints,
warning all persons against jÂ»urcbafiog from the
grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
â large, real and personal estates he conveyed away to
bis fon-in law and to his children the refalt of
j a deliberation had upon the fubjeft by a general and
numerous meeting of the cieditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu.
tion of that trust confided in the fubferibers by
those creditors s a step which it would have been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very statement of the fadt therefore must dif.
the pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or vindiflive." It originated in a desire secure
the property of the debtor at a fund for the pay.
ment of his just debts* It was fan&ioned by the
advice of council as a measure nectjfary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advertisement has been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjuftifiable conduct, not to the subÂ»
fcribers who have merely published the truth ia
terms as mild as the fÂ»A would admit, and whÂ»
mean te investigate in a high court of justice the
validity of those purcbafes of whinh Mr. M'Cle
nachan so confidently fpeskt.
The fubfenbert therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the creditors in general to repeat their
caution against purehafing of those grantees or
either of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
the purchase from any other persons (if such there be)
m ?" ta whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar

HOUSt OF REPRE^fNTATJV*!.
J Monday, December 19.
â Tvfr. (TrcLptacc vTi
Mr. Bourne appointed diftridt judge) appeared and
took his oath and feat.
Mr. W. Smith said that the bill to proride for
organizing, arming and difcipliniag the militia of
the United Stato was amonglt the orders of the
day. He wished that bttlinefs to be taken up, in
order to determine the principle, whether the mili
tia fhauld be continuedtipon it* present footing, or
whether it ftiauld be divided into two clafTes, viz. a
fcleift corps and a reserved corps, as contemplated
by the present bill. Until thiiquetlion Mas decided
, nothing cyuld be done. For his own part, he said,
he was ao military man, but he had made it his bu
siness to enquire inte and he found it
1 to be the opinioh of those well verfetj in military
matters, that the plan propufed by this bill could
not be carried iuto effect with fuccels. He wished,
' i however, the house to come to the deeifion. If it
was their wi.li to continue the militia upon the pre
sent plan, and Â»>t adopt tbc plan propofc J by the
bill, the fttft clause Â®ould be Stuck out. This
would eonfiderably IhortcÃ the business ; and as the
fefiion would be a (hort one, the sooner the house
, went into the bufttreftthe better; he therefore ho
ped the house would resolve itfelf iuto a committee
of the whole on that fubje&.
The house accordingly itfelf into a com
-1 mittee of the whole, Mahlfnberg in the chair,
when the fir ft fe&ioa being read, which is in the
following words,
1 Sec. 1. fie it enadled, Itc. That ftiom and sfter
' the p..fling of this aft, the militia of the United
States (hall be composed ofr all able bodied white
male citizens of the refpeflitve Rates, rcfidcnt there
[ in, who (hall, refpeiSively, be of the age of twenty
years, and onder the age of forty years. That the
said militia (hall be divided into two clafles, the fide
class to be denominated the fele& corps of the mili
tia of the United States ; the second class to be
denominated the reserved corps of the militia of
the United States. The feleft corps of the militia
of the United States (hall be composed of all able
bodied wfiite-male citizens, refpedliÂ«ely, who (hall
be of the age of twenty years, and under the a(Â»e
of twenty-five years. The reserved corps (Hall be
composed of all able bodied while male citizens,
refptftively, who (hall be of the age of twanty
fave years, and under the age of_forty years : Pro
vided, that, in the choice of officers, either of the
felcft corps, or reserved corps, no refpeel shall be
- had to the limitations of age aforefaid, she forego
i ing regulations to be fahjett, however, to the ex
i emptioris hereafter fpecihed."
Mr. VV. Smith made a motion to strike cut the
firft fe&ioa of the bill. When the fubje& was for
' taerly under difcuflion a number of objections were
' made to this clause, particularly to the great ex
pence, to the inconvenience of drawing out a num
ber of people from their houses to form companies,
and other difficulties which appeared infti. mounta-
He hoped,-therefore, some fcherÂ»e of amend
ing the present fyllem would be hit upon* and that
it might by such means be made a very good ene. c
He hoped his motion would therefore be agreed to. 1
fjg Mr. Dearborn fecorded the motion. He did it |
with the fame view which the mover had exprefled
Cot making it, viz. to (harten the bufinflt, by saving
the lime which a discussion of the fcveral pait* of
the bill would necefTarily consume, taking it for
granted, at he did, that the bill would not pass
The objection* brought againlt themeafure when i:
was fotmerly before the house, he thought fubftaa
tiall Great many parts of the bill before thtm were
not ndmiffible into a militia system. The firtt clause
held o*t an idea repugnant to that part of the coun
try with which he was acquainted. He meant the
fe!e6\ corps.âlf the firft clause was agieed te be
flruck out, the next motion would be to have the
bill re-committed.
Mr. Harper believed considerable difficulty would
attend the carryiug into effe& the bill proppfed.
Bat be believed alio that their choice was j>et'wixt
this difficulty and the total want of an effectual mi
litary system. He wobU submit it to the coi.fide
ration of the committee, which of thele alterna
tives should be adopted. It was dated that to or
ganize a feledl corps would be attended with great
expcnce. He believed that apy effectual fyflem
would attended with great expcnce. Whether
the military neeeffcry for the defence df our coun
try fliauld coubfl of a (landing force {whiclf- none
of them wilhed) er of a feledt corp*, Â»or of any
other kind of corps, great etpence would be in
curred It had been dated,.that to draw out fd
great a number of young people from their homes
and labour, to be inftrufitd in military duty, would
not only lessen the dock of labour, and consequent
ly of national wealth, but would a!lb have a tenden
cy to injure their moral*. If gentlemen contera
pUteb the period at which these persons would be
draws together, he believed the obje<SioÂ» with ref
pecl to labour -would vanish. It was fuppofei that
, 2 5> r 3 w Â«ltt in the tall, and the fame length of ,
time at some other season would be enough for the
purpose. And it was well known that there were
fÂ«afons of the year when lahoreti might very well ;
be (pared for two or three weeksâand if it were
only fur Â»ne week, it would be better tLat none. H
With refpedl to morals, little apprehension needed '
to be entertained on that head. It was not con- 1
templatcd he said, to bring them into very large en- '
campments, nor intfi towns, to keep them long so- '
gether, or that they should be free from redraint or '
authority, being, he said, under military order and '
discipline, they would have no time to run into ri- '
ot or disorder. He believed, therefore, that these
objections against the proposed bill were r.ot fuffi. j 1
ciently weighty. That the present fydem was very j J
defective, they had abundant evidence from military i 1
men, from repeated communicatiot s from the Pre ; '
fident on the fubjeft, and Jiom an event not very <
remote U heu necessity ealled out the militia, when j
it was seen that they were more indebted to the ia- ; '
dividual patriotic spirit of our citizens than to our '
militia laws.
It then the present fyfttm was aot adequate) it C
mufl be altered. How was this to be done. ? Could '
it be done as the old fy*em flood? He believed ]
not. It, said be, yeu will not arm the people, and
funjeÂ£t them to military duty, what wnuld be the '
efoft of a militia ? It would prove that inefiVAual J
r up tft t iea of a'n eSr&aal mili- 1
i tia, orabindon the prefentdyftem. This brought '
them to bili before the commute#, which proposed '
r a new fydem. Whether the present manner ot mo- 1
{ difying the business be the right one ; whether 1
r all persons between 18 and 25 fhali be included,
1 or whether any other regulation would be prefer- 1
. able, it was for the house to decide ; but he said t
r fomethiiig of the kind proposed must be adopted, c
i or all iaeas of 11* ional defence must be given up. t
1 Gentlemen frnm some parts of the Uniou were not so c
i tl.iki.igly impressed with the necessity of this mea- c
, furc, as were others. In the Eallern dates he knew c
. that the whole body of thÂ« militia sould ealily be t
t brought into aSivity ; but when the fame rule was t
r applied to a country thinly fettled, a regiment was d
| spread over twenty, and in fume inltances, fÂ«,ty .
, miles fqiitre, and io such they could not be r
t properly trained. Admitting that the picfeiu fyf t
tcm is wholly impracticable where tl/e Settlement' is ii
: thin, it became a question whether the fyttem pro- v
( poled in its stead would be injurious to the more t
: thickly fettled pans of the couqtry. in the a
; cittern ftaies perhaps iiime additional burthen a
. would be laid upon the people, and some inconve- r
nienccs felt, but wpuld these be so great as were now t
felt by other parts of the country ? He believed not, ii
aud the system ricommended would have the ad- I
, vantage of. being every where practicable. r
With those jmpreffions, it was impoffibie he should t
agreeto diikr'but tins clause. He hoped it would t
â  be reiained, and thai the bill would be discussed a
I thro*ghfcut, as.be was couvinccd nÂ» oiher system ii
: could )t>e reducedito practice. P
Mr. Sitgreaves said he kad sot the honor of a si
feat'ioihat whi'n thig_f>t(Â»jccf was so --acrly undei t
: dituf!ion ;he wn's therefore but partially acquaint- v
: ed with it. With ilii (fate of Peniiiyl- I
vania, he believed all concursvd iu opioion, that 1
â  there was an-abfolute necefiity as some new arrange- t
: ment to give efficacy and spirit to the military fyf- ti
; tem. No onÂ« v he said, cojsld doubt the braveiy u
or patiiotic spirit of our-ctuzc'ns ; but he always
underflood that bravery was Dot fufficynt â¢ p
if it Veto, they had better tl'fcard o'ur ipiliij. fyf. \
tem altogether. JJut if it wai true that ditciplifle ti
was the life and foul of an array, id tÂ»as<their duty w
to meet with firmnefs all diffi.ultics which ik. v.
the way. If thisthfiipline cSET3 only be acquired tt
by meanÂ«o, some mode like proposed i : . tiir c
bill before thenv'neither trouble or cxpenoe (houUl /
prevent them Tro.Â» the bufiusi*.â -v.
He said, it was aot by calling men togeiLei a jay w
or two in theycar'that discipline \i#t to beatuin- >I<,
ed, but by some such plan as the prefeat. He muU li
therefore, hear tfionger objr(ftiÂ»iiÂ« againtt the' mca- g
sure than had vft been urged, befone he cttuld vote -p.
for striking out the clause in -^ueftion.
The bill before them, Mr. Sitgneaveg said, was oi
the system of Baron Steuben. Ke knew this tns f
a favorite fyllca with the citizess of this slate. It a <
was said there were dates ia the Uaiou in which ihe at
militia laws required no amendment ;if so, he wish- tf
cd gentlemen from those Hates ivoulj coÂ«mÂ»nicate pi
to the cotataittee the means which had bceu used to
it attain this >.er/e<3 Rate, iha''tstr militia of themid
:d die aad Southern itaiet might be put upon a bet
lg ter footing. If not, he (hculd not cowfent to pÂ«t
of- with the plan before them.
Mr. Henderfon wi&cd to have the militia put
â  J upon a refpednble fouling, at much as any taer&ucr
of ttie coÂ»mit!ee, but was of opinion, tint thÂ«
lyttern proposed by the bill under con(ideration
,- c wauid not hare that effedâHe hoptd the motion
ts (tiike o,ut the firÃ fedion might prevail, as t ] le
principles it coataiu<rd, were to his mind very u b-
jedianable.
>e Mr. H. obferred, that in a republican govern*
. meat, the burtheus of Â»Â«vei iimem, (of whichihe
Id miiitity are the molt irksome,) ouaht to be diltri
i- buted in as equable a degree as poffiblc among the
citixenfthis would not be the cafe if the fyftein
i- proposed was' carried into effedâHe observed,
c- that the inequality of the burthen upou the feiect
Â»- coi ps, as contemplated by- the bill now under cohfi.
r- deration, must (Irike us forcibly, when we coaiider
the class of citizeus that is to bÂ«ar itâThis corps,
n is to be composed of persons from the of 20,
* tÂ» 25 years, perhaps not more than one fifth part
i- of the number of citizens able io bear arms, of
ie this number, there will be many that will pay a l e .
y gal equivalent rather than render perfonai fervtce,
>- he supposed, for the fake of calculation, one fourth
d part, then fays Mr. Henderfon, there will be left
â  3 three fourths of one fifth pait of the whole Â»um
d bar of' citizcns able to bear arm*, that must (land
- as a bulwark of defence for the Union, making a.
1- bout every sixth man, and those of the most indi
- gent part of the communityâHe was of opinion
e that it would not be sale tor government to depend
- npon them, detached from the reft of the tailitia,
t that they would be unequal to the defencc of our
f country ia cafe of emergencies.
e
e He viewed that part ef the fyftera, which relatea
[| to the calling oat of the feled corps, any given
c Ipace of time, for the purpose of fcqMiriaff rartvt*-
-rydifcipUue, oFTor training of them, as unconfti
j tutioaal. Mr. H. observed he had Bot the confti
_ tution before him, but he would venture to quote
. from memory the words theieof relative to the
. fubjed now under confederationâThey ate these,
r " The Congress Ihali have power to provide for
J organizing, arming and disciplining the militia,
. reserving to the states, refpedively, the authority
e ( of training the militia, according to the discipline
. , prcfcribed by Congress." Here the po.etruf con.
, grefs is confined to certain objeds, and cannot be
. extended to efcibrace the meature proofed by the
, bill, vix. that of training the militia.
Mr. Her.deifon thought the measure very excep
tionable on account of the great cxpcnce that
would attend itâTire feled corps, he obfefcred,
would not be put into motion fit for service, :â¢
t contemplated by this bill, under the expence of be
j tween two and three million! of dollars, and it
j will require the annual expence of between three
j and four hundted thouland dollars, to keep up the
corps, according to the calculations tie had mi V
j which have been founded on the fuppofni
the feled cot pi WimlH (-nntai.i
tnouiand men, officers included, and to e
t out fifteen days yearly) for the puipofe o!
; ing military discipline'âHe would not vai. I or
the accuracy of his calculations, but would p
to fay that, he had not exaggerated.
i The measure, Mr. H. said, was obje; . s
â¢ upon anothei groundâlt is but a (hart tir - â . e
1 the general government had by law aboil
1 old militia system and eftablilhed a new Â»
â  tiÂ«n of the piilitiaâ By this law tlis offict c
Â» deranged from the major-general, through ;
different grades, down to the loweit ran ,
companies have been formed, and all the 1 . r*
aewly elededâa large proportion v of cavil; v. was
takeu into the organizationâcompanies o ;ra

âHow far this law has been operated upco gene
rally he could not determine, but with tc.'ard to
the Sate he had the ironor to represent he be!ie>ir-'.
it had been carried into complete effect, DHt vol
without giea: expence to individualsâHe thought
tlie~mi!itix'ot New-Jersey was upon a very refped
able footing, a fpint ejjiuliitioii liad oeeu excited
among them to appear well in their military cha
â  rader. And shall we, said Mr. H. difcourarr e
thisfpirit? He was of opinion the proposed fyllcivi,
if carried into operation, would effcdually do so.
Besides, the several Kates have scarcely had tinie to
regulate their fy Items agreeably to that organiza.
Hon, and the militia time to fettle down under
thear regulations, and fiiall we again disorganize,
aud dVunge the whole ? He hoped notâlt would
Â»n his opinion add greatly to the agitation of the
public mind, whish Â«Sl already, upon other occa
sions, conliderably excited. He observed further,
that it would argue such a want of ability ia gol v
vcrnmcut, as he wished miglit never be exhibited.
Hebeiioved l.is cbnftituents were well fatisfied witb
tite ptet'ent fyitem, or with the genjral principles

ive in an affe<9ionate address to the "People
e"d States, declined a re-election to the chief
of the nation, to which you wouid hare
:Ci' c illed by the public voice 1 the General Af
irginia wculd be unfaithful to the feelings
iftituents, and regardless of their own, if
y beheld an event long deprecated by yÂ«iur .
-ens While they deplore the refblution,
wticn . deprive the nation of its firft hope, they are '
unable to ieprefs those sensations of gratitude and ef- c
teem arifmg from the profpeft of her beloved citizen's t
return into the bosom of his native* state, and c
which services, precious as your's, excite in every ,
brenft. On a review of the whole tenor of your life,
fq strongly marked bv wisdom, valor and putriotifm,
they te.-l themselves' ftiinulateti to bestow upon you the
belt rev<ard that freemen can give, and the most grate
ful a mi'd like your's, can receive. And ihcy have a
plejfmg 3d firm atTurance, that therr posterity to the
most rem ââ¢ generations, and the friends ol ti-ue and
.genuine I <:rty and of the rights of man throughout â 
the worla, and in all succeeding age*, will unite in the
acclamation y, hile with one voice they dcclare, that
you lvave deserved well of your country. I
_ " To this permit tham to add their fervent fupplica- (
tions te Heaven, that you may long rontinue to ei.joy |
thole blessings whish you have been lo inftru mental in 1
procuring to yor country,and in that repose which |
yuu have always facrificed iu obedicswe to the v;ill 1
of your nation, that you may poftefs that heart felt
fat'ufaflion of beholding its happipefs and prosperity
Jncreafe under the. tufpiccs of that liberty, and of tlfat
government, whici your valour and wisdom have so
efTentially contributed lo cllablilh and maintain."
The speech of Govetmor Vanderhorjt to the le- 1
giflatu'e of South-Carolina, containing much poli
tical wisdom and man ' truly federal and patriotic
fentimenti, we hare plenfure-in giving some Â«xtraÂ£li
tlierefrom. It is much to be regretted hy the â 
friends of our union that such a chief magiflfate
ftiould be about to retire from his office.
" The iconftitutional r'ght of Congress lay
and collet taxes and duties, import* and excifee,
to pay the debts and provide for the common de
fence and wcltarc, has been hitherto very moderate,
ly exercised, and has extend d littfc further than
commercial imports and duties on imported articles.
But it eaunot fee afcertaiued hew soon future exi
gencies and necefiiiies may call T>r other tefources
and lÂ»ad to more dirtdl taxation, in spite of all
that fltift economy *nd prudent management which
k&ve pervadtd tÂ»cr)r departmem of gorernaient.
We (liould, therefore, endeavor to anticipate that
pen'od, place ourfelves,-by a timely diminution S
t.t our state dci>t f in a fi-.uatioo to answer and de- tc
fray' with suitable alacrity nnd ability, our prÂ»jÂ»or-
Honor taxes to the general governrncÃt, and not ft
pcirait the pressure of- tÃeoi, coojjerdting with a In
heavy ft.te debt, to be th"e Usrce Â«f difaffeftion si
and difcontcnt towards that "utu'on from which so si
, ma*y prosperous coufecjuences hare already result- is
ed, ajid on whi. hive mull continue to depend for ra

While nations have Wren mvolyed in thefiferceft
and bloodicfl contests that have e*er aifiiae4 and
desolated the world, of whom we had
treaties of amity and commerce [ with'others wete
in the habits of iÂ»mmeicial intercourse;
it was extremely difficult to avoid being ilravvn into f.
a participation of their warfare.. â
'â¢ Ihe maintenance of freedom from all foreign e,
, influence, wisdom to difceÂ»n, and Srmacfs to resist lc
all the arts and cabals of drfigHtog emiiTaries; a n
sacred regard to the piighfed faith of treaties, a ri- v
gid adherence to the laws of nations, and Ready
observation of the ri-htÂ» and obligations of nÂ«u- p
trality, were elTentiallv requilite, to avoid giving y
umbrage to the belligerent powen, and exciting *
their resentment and enmify. 'h
" This wife conduift and jitft policy have hi-'
therto not only saved us from all-the horrors of war,
but have enabled lis to reap abundantly the advan
tage* which may result to commercial liatioas from
a state of neutrality. \ >

i ed .states, atchievmg such great and salutary ob
â¢ je6ts, have been so unifoimly and firmly adopted
and executed by the separate governments of the 0

" This happy expetience ought to impress inde- '
[ hfcly oa us alj, the expediency of uaiou a 'id of a

" The general government of the United States,

' theft it is said, frora those which "have been opened, i
are of a very important nature, aud that there is no
