STATE OF THE UNION. hie
as f
Wednesday, March 28.
The House having again resolved itfelf into a
committee of the whole on the ft ate of the
Union, and the amendment to the tint re
solution, moved by Mr. Sprigg, as to the
inexpediency* under exiftingcircumftances,
of resorting to war against the French Re
publicâwhich amendment is to strike out j
the words French Republic, being under
consideration, tie
MR. PINCKNEY rose, and said he was
in favour of the amendment, because it 1
tended to make what he thought an improper
proposition, in some degiee, nugatoVy;, for he
believed to agree to the resolution without it B
would be prejudicial, to the interest and wel
fare of the country, as he did not think the 1
period was arrived which called for a decision
onmeafuresofwarorpeace. If fuchla decla
ration had been necessary, he fliould have ex
petted it to come from gentlemen in favour
of a war, declaring, that it is expedient to go
to war, as it was a very uncommon thing to
declare we will not do a thing. His (trongeft â¢
reason against coming to this resolution, how- 1
ever, w:is, that at this period the House had v
not fufficient information concerning the whole
of this bufuiefs, to enable them to form a c Â°r- â¢
re6t judgment upon it. The President.told
the House, indeed, that he had little hope of J
a favourable termination of the negociation,
but they knew nothing of the train of the ne
gociation, or oi the circumftancesattending it.
They knew that our ConrtmilTioners had not '
been received; but they had not fufficientin-
formation as to the manner in which they had
been treated, to enable them to come to the S
decision proposed. . t)
The gentleman who moved the resolution,
said it was time to come forward and declare
whether we will have peace or war. Would '
to God, said Mr. P. it was in our power, by
any such declaration, to avert war, or maintain
peace; but he believed this did not depend
upon any declaration of ours. Inqueftionsof
war, there were always two parties, one of P
whom was generally the aggressor, and the
other generally passive. In the present cafe, "
he considered this country as the pallive
and therefore any declaration on our part
would have little effect. We know that indi
viduals, or nations, induced to pursue mea- IU
fures from interest or passion, are not eai'ily
diverted from their purpose. IftlieÂ¥Â«Bch 0
are aituated by either of these motives, no 0
declaration of ours will prevent tlve calamity. 01
Such a proposition would rather accelerate 01
than prevent the evil. If our declarations "1
could have availed, they have not been want- 'Â°
ing. Frpm the firtt period Â»fa Hiifunderftand- <u
TTig 'petween the two countries, declarations
have been made deprecating war in general
terms, but particularly with that nation. A
Minilter Plenipotentiary had been sent to ex
plain the views of this government, and to re- l!
roove any jealoolies which might exist, and to
' make such fpecific propositions as were tho't "
necessary Â» but our ininUt?r was rejected witji
outa hearing. 'The next meafurt was to fend S'
special Commitlioners, in order to fettle our j P 1
difference?, and avert thfr calamity of war.â
We have therefore made fufficient declarati- 13
ons of our pacific intentions. Indeed he tho't T )
too much had been rested on these declarati- D
ons, as nothing had been <}. one for pur de
fence. When we looked at our sea-ports, "
and law their defencelefs condition, he tho't c '
it was evident fufficient attention had not been ,c
paid to them, knowing that war mijjht, at
least, be a poilible event. _ *
But the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.
Giles) lays the affairs of th-: cftlintry are ex- r<
tremely changed, and that this 13 the time foi
making a stand, and this opinion he draws 11
from the President's message. He thought it JÂ»
was well observed yesterday by the gentleman '<
from Connecticut (Mr. Dana) that the change Â«
which the President spoke of might relate to Â»
the change ot disposition in the persons own- 11
ing merchant vetlelsas to their views in arm- "
ing.
Mr. P. thought there was another reason 'J
â why the declaration did nol go the length "
which had been stated. In the course of a j!
war, the Wndutt ot belligerent powers to neu- 1
tral nations is apt to change. At the begin- "
nlng of a war, neutral trade is not so much t
preyed upon as it afterwards comes to be. In t
the beginning of the present war, we- saw no (l
declaration from Denmark and Sweden as to t
the course they intended to take with respect c
to their neutral trade; but when spoliations c
were committed upon it, the governments of I
those countries csune forward aud said, " as- V
fairs are now changed, we think it necessary to 1
convoy our xeHsk. and to give them the pro- 1
tedtion to which they are entitled by treaty."
This conduct was never looked upon as a cause r
of war j on the contrary, those countries re- r
main at peace, and are likely to remain so. t
Therefore, a. cluuge in defenfive measures did <"
not bring the matter to the point which the I
gentleman from Virginia supposed.
This resolution differed exceedingly from any *
thing which took placfe when we had a mis- t
understanding with England in 1794- At that \
time when England issued her extraordinary j I
order of the 4th of November, and our com- \ *
merce was depredated upon, measures were i c
fpokenoffor countervailing the injuries which j 1
our citizens experienced, but 110 proposition j t
like the present was produced. We are now 1
aggrieved and injured, in a mod extraordinary <
manner, but we fay we will not go to war.â 1
On a former occasion he had heard of a varie
ty of reftridtive regulations, proposed with a 1
view of restraining the injuries committed up- 1
on us, and to bring Great Britain to reason ; 1
and he did expeÂ£t something similar would
have been proposed 011 the present occasion, 1
but nothing of the kind had appeared. It I
was true we had not so great hold of the 1
' French nation as of the Britilh, in this refpett, 1 !
but we have some ; and he believed measures
might be taken which would induce that na- ;
tion to liearreafon. But, instead of this, it is .
proposed tli.it we should fay, " we have been
injured and aggrieved ; but we will not op- '
pole you, we wilt not go to war with you." ,
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Nicho. ;
las) seemed to reft great part oÂ£ his arguments
upon the /ower oi the IJoufe to make war, or
to declare peace. Mr. P. agreed that this
was legislative power, and not eSecu,tive, 2nd
he was for this Hcnfc excrcifing fhat power;
but, aihe had already (tated, they had not at
present fufÂ£cient information 011 the fubjett.
But tiiat gentleman seemed to charge the Ex
ecutive with all the evils ot our present (ittia
tion. Upon this fttbjecl he concurred in opi
nion witli the.goirteman from Pennfylvaoia
(Mr, Gallatin) that it was unnccefTary to en
quire from whence our present situation arose,
or 10 go into rccrirnrtation. This Could only
tieate heat, and kaep up that idea of div'.fion
which had been iiiuui'cioufly-fpread, and at a
time when the legiilature ought to do all in
its pointer to extingtrfh it. [Mr. Nicholas
explained âHe had laid he would not go into
an enquiry as to the conduct of this govern-
ment with respect to France ; bat if any ro Â® a " '
fures of ours had produced-the breach, they
muff be those of the Executive, because t le
legiilature has had nothing to do with them. , Jo
He would allure the gentleman from South- ' j,
Carolina he Ihould not'iake the lead in any he
inch enquiry, but keep out of view, as much
as poilible, past tninfaaiaru.] Mr. P. was ar
elad to hear thtsexplanatio'ii. HÂ« lumfelf be- tli
Sieved the measures of the Executive had ie
been calculated to promote peace ; but it was
not neceflfary to go into that fubjeCt.
The gentleman from PennfyWan.a (Mr. th
Gallatin) had gone further than perhaps the tiÂ«
resolution on the table would warrant. He la
fays the adoption of this resolution will go to m
prevent the taking of any mealures which le
â  may, in their tendency, lead to war. ltgen- tn
tlemen meant by this that it was to prevent la
any measures being taken for the protection . tl
ot our commerce, the adoption of the refolu- , in
tion would not only declare that we will not . t.
go to war, but that we will not take any mea- j tl
fures for the defence rtf our property. It ap- j h
peared to him, that that gentleman had him- j c<
felf given the belt reasons for modifying this , n
resolution, so as to make it as little mifchiev- 1 g 1
ous as poilible. For he had told the commit- ,
tee that France had set at nought her treaty >v
with us ; but though they have done this, 1j
said Mr. P. they have endeavoured to juftity n
their depredations, by insisting that, accord
ing to that treaty, it was neceflary for velfels w
tp carry a role d'quipage. Mr. P. added, p
there was another order of the French govern- e
ment which was so contrary to right, so cruel o
in its consequences, so degrading to this coun- 1<
â  try, and so inhuman in its tendency, that he e
could not avoid noticing it. It was the de
cree which declares that every American citi- n
zen found on board the privateer of an enemy, a
lhall be considered and treated as a pirate, g
They pretended to found this order on our 0
1 treaty with Great Britain ; but he willied t
, gentlemen who thought it iuftifiable, to turn J
to that treaty, and fee whether there v*as any '
thing there which countenanced so violent a t
, measure. But this is not all, the gentleman ,
from Pennsylvania allowed that a decree had 1
lately been palled which violates all the laws 1
! of neutial nations, viz. that if the property, j
1 manufactures or produce ofanenemy be found
f on board a neutral vessel, it (hall be good t
r prize. Our ministers affo, who were com- Â®
! mif'ioned to conciliate, and even to make co.l- 1
cellions, though they had been in Paris thr:e
' months, cap in hand, had not been able to get c
$ a hearing. Underall these grievances, what, 1
said he, are we called upon to do ? H'e should A
not have been surprized if some one, fired t
, with the injuries we have received, had bro't t
! forward a proposition for war. But, inflcad 1
( of this, smarting as we are under injuries-, '
our commerce bleeding at every pore, and 1
; our co-rr.rry aeeply huiiniialed, we are called 1
5 upon to fay, " You have done every thing
\ to injure, insult and degrade us, but we hays S
defervedit; we will do nothing to oppose '
. you. Though God and nature have given 1
I us power we will not go to war with you, nei- â¢
ther on the present ojcafion, nor on any o- '
ther, whatever injury you may commit upon 1
" us."
, Was there any thing in our situation, which
t called for this declaration ? He thought not. 1
The gentleman (Mr. Giles) fays he would not
j go to war, except in cafe of invasion. He ap
r . prehended this neither a wife nor a fafe poli
. ; cy. He believed, if it was necessary, the ca
lamities of war must be reported to. Ifinju
t ry upon injury is heaped upon us, we fhail be
brought into a situation in which it will be ne
cessary to annoy our enemy. He did not fay
that point was yet come ; but it will be ne
t ccil'arv, prudent and wife, to take measures
n to prevent the enemy from coming to our
t do<jr. Because, if prepared, we should, as on
a former occasion, be enabled to intercept any
troops which may be sent against us. But he
regretted to fee so different a spirit animating
our citizens now, from that which animated
s them in our revolutionary llruggle. We did
t not then prevent our vessels from arming in
n felf-defence. Though we then deprecated
e war, we made preparations ti meet it, if it
0 (hould be necessary. Though the extsnt ps
injury was not then so great as at present;
. when all the ufurpition attempted upon uS,
was a regulation of taxationâa tivo-penny du
n ty upon tea, yet it caused a ferment and spirit
h which was effedhial at that time, and which
a spirit, he trusted, was not now extinguished.
Indeed, he was convinced, that if gentlemen
_ in favour of the proposition, could fee our fi
h tuation in the fame light in which he and o
n thers saw it, they would be in favour of as
o strong measures as any of them. The coun
-0 try fi*om whence these gentlemen generally
come, had shewn its determined opposition to
js oppression from whatever quarter it came,
if He wished, tlierefore, they could fee the op
*_ preffionsof the government whose conduft he
0 had been reviewing, in the fame light which
he did.
â Â» However-hnmiliating pui conduct might be,
fe he repeated, it would hdve no effeit upon that
nation. He did not wish to animadvert upon
j. the condutt of any country; but there was
d oneinftanceof the treatment whicli the French
ie Republic has exhibited to an independent
(late, which he co. id not help noticing. It
iy was in refpeit to Venice, which would (hew
f. that no humiliation, no concefiion, wonld a
n vert the calamity which threatens us, if the
â¢y j Rulers of that country are determined upon
1- i war. If he was not misinformed, the cir
re 1 cumftances of the cafe were as follows : The
h Venetians were at peace, and endeavouring
in ito pursue a line of neutrality. A tumult a
w rose in one of their towns, and the populace
ry did, in a barbarous and molt ur.juftifiable mAn
â ner, massacre a number of French soldiers.
;- This was an injury which called for and de
a served atonement. A retaliation toÂ»k place
jji fully commensurate with the crime. The Ve
-1 ; netiansmade every concefiion in their power.
Id But the French Csmtnander was not fatisfied,
n, he took vengeance upon them by overturning
It their government âa government which had
lie ftopd the test of joo years. He fliould have
it, 1 supposed that the French would now have
â¢es been fatisfied ; but the matter did not (top
a- here. The government being overturned,
is 1 the people were {iromifed a free government,
en t and an amelioration of their condition. They
p- | were prQCÂ«cdingin the establishment of a go
| vernment ; the treaty.-carne to be
p. ; lnado betwixt the French Republic and the
its Emperor, he fuppoted it was thought to be
or the interest of that Republic to facrifice a part
lisps tlrs territory, and to give it up to the Em
nd peror, to take a part so themselves, and to
r; annex ano.her part to the Cisalpine Republic,
at This was done ; and lie believed the very p*rt
t. which had committed the offence against the
x- French government, had been rewarded, by
1a- being joinfd to a free government,
pi- Thii diviiionof the Venetian territory was
nia not the work of a young officer, elated by
:n- victory and conmieft, or enraged by the treat
fe, ment wh:ch h'S soldiers had received. The
nly French Direitory had conte forward, and by
ion their decree, had Â»pplauded the wlrple con
it a du6t of the r general in the most unqualified
;in terms, particularly as to Venice and Genoa.

: resolution, will not go to war. Ihe p p
tion held a directly contrary language, l
fays, "that, under present c.rciimftancM, jÂ°
i the United States deem it advisable jo rel "
!!in a state of peace." [ Mr. P.NCKÂ« sa id,

. }he should not be for gum? to war, un^fi^t he
â  1 country waj He, theiefpre, j
; ! nefte.i the resolution and this .declaration to
. ' ?ether.] Mr. G. (aid, he full repeated the
â  : fame thing ; that we ou ; ;ht nÂ°t to de
/ war beyond the limits 01 the United States.
Bur he drew a contrary inference from this,
/ from that which that gentleman had drawj),
- because he had accompanied the declaration -
s wi th another, that he was perfectly ready to j Â»
prepare to that extent for defence. He would <
. explain the grounds of this opinion. \v ithin â 
1 our own limits, we are capable ot making J
. fbmethiag like exertion, and there he believ
e ed exertions might be made to advantage.
- Indeed one of the propositions which is con
. netted with the present, goes to this purfctfe 'Â«
and therefore, with what propriety could tue
gentleman fay, he and those who were oi His â¢
r opinion, were not for preparing for defence V
till the enemy is at the door f Nor could he
n fee any thing like humiliation in this. Nay,
y lie was convinced, if we carried our prepara
a tions for defence beyond our own limits, in- 1 '
n stead of gaining glory or honour, we (hall P
j meet with nothing but disgrace, asweaienot
s to make a defence at sea. Indeed J
the moment we get beyond our jurisdictional
I j line, defence will become offence, becaule 11
d there will be no evidence bj' which it can be
ascertained by whom the attack commenced.
. It would, therefore, be unvfife to permit our- *
e selves to be placed in this frtuation. lfÂ»*f w
. t object was to bei effected by going o**? to lea, *
it mud be the protection Our commerce Â»
d with Great Britain ; hut it was known thai n
cl the two aits of iV.E Britilh Parliament, which lr
>t took plac*:n January last if peace continues,
d may take that trade, in a great measure, froiih Â®
s, "Us. He did not think, therefore, that this Â»
d was a fufficient objeft for which to incur so J
d muchrifk.
g At pjrefent, fad Mr. G. there is a pretty *
s gelieral opinion in the country (and he thoughi S
> there was much ground for the opinion) that 0
n there is a difpolition in a part of this houle, 0
j. and in part of the government, for war ; and c
he thought it was proper to come to a declara- j 1
, n tion upon the fubjeit. This would not only
have a good effect upon our own citizens j v
h but it would convince European powers, that e
t. though we were preparing for defence, we 0
3 t were not preparing for war. 1
Mr. G. said, he was not fatisfied with the a
i_ conftnitlion which the gentleman from Con- f
nefticut (Mr. Dana) had given to that part 1
of the melfage which speaks of our situation 1
>e being changed. He did not believe the Pre- r
.. fident had any reference to the dispositions J
iy of the people," but to the state of things ge- '
.. tierally.
es The apprchenfion of war had already begun <
LIT l " ttilergfcctrWr *
?n the country. He had received information 1
!y that produce had fallen in price, and that the 1
lie sale was very dull. He was of opinion, there- 1
-,g fore, that the proposed declaration, if agreed 1
ed to, would appease the minds of the people.â (
id It was said it would have no good effect upon I
in the Executive Direftory. He did not know j 1
e d that it would. But it could have no bad ef- j '
it feit ; and it might have a good oneâfor he i :
ps did not think that body qtiite so abandoned as '
t. some gentlemen thought them. 1
iSj The gentleman last up had spoke of the par- 1
' u . tition of Venice. He himfelf saw it with con- '
rit cern ; but where was the difference in crime
c h betwixt the French Republic and the Empe
d. ror ; each took a part. But what was all this
en to the United States ? Were they to go to
si- war to avenge thiÂ» partition > We heard no
0. thing of this kind, some years ago, when a
as partition of Poland took place. For his own
n- part, he wished to leave the powers of Europe
lly to themselves, and to draw ourselves within
to our own boundary, where we should be fully
ie. equal to our defence against any power on
( p. earth.
he Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) said, that mod
ch of the arguments of the gentleman who spoke
last from Virginia (Mr. Giles) were most con
oe, clufive in favour of tUe amendment, altho' it
iat appeared to bo his intension to vote against it.
ion That member had deprecated war as the
vas greatest of calamities, and spoken of peace as
ich thefirftofbleftings, and yet alUhis warmth of
Â«nt declamation in favour of pacific tneafure-. had
It resolved itfelf into an anxiety to maintain it
ew with one nation only. As to the objection
a- that the amendment was notimmediatelycon
the netted with the meffageof the Prefidenf; Mr.
ion Dnyton remarked that not that communication
only, but the " State of the Union" was un
"he der consideration, and it was upon this broad
intr ground alone that the resolution could have
S- been introduced, for it did not naturallv arise
acc out of the meflage, Which had not proposed
in- to Congress to declare war, nor to att eflen
jrs. fively in any respect. ,
de- In attempting to render that resolution by
ace amendments less objectionable, he would not
/e- be underltood as approving it, for altho' the
er. sentiment was jirit, altho' the position
ed, true, yet nothing could be more idle than to
ing employ ourselves in lengthy difcufftons of
had what it might be incxp;Jicnt to do, at -a time
ave when all fides of the House agreed that we
ave ought to deliberate on what ought to be done

they had particularly quoted, and asked whe

lint r a 'veto by this act upon such intention, 1>
ivas the reÂ»l object of those gentlemen. Mr. ai
Dayton concluded with faying who
loved peuce with all the world, mult vote for ar
the amendment, ,but those who regarded it h;
anly towards the French Republic, would be tl
right in adhering to the original proportion. J'
>lr. Shepard said, the rcfilution before oi
the committee, feeiried to carry with it Sli y<
idea that the of the President was a p;
tlechirationof war, and that tjiis was lo deflroy p :
its effeft ; and to prevent them, if war Ihouid
be necelfary, from taking proper meafurcs of w
liefence. He was not for going to war ; but f Q
for taking every measure lo keep out of it.â z<
In order to effect-this, he wished to prepare w
fordefence, which he considered as the bell .
fccurity against war. He inlifted upon our tl
right to do this, regardless of any foreign na- 11
tion. He would not only fortify our ports, P
but have armid velfels to defend our <.oafh, ft
and hold our militia in requisition. He had '1
heard the meUage of the President called a de- lc
claration of war ; but for his part all he had ' a
heard of war was from gentlemen who are so 0
loudly opposed to it, as if they were the only l <
men in the tountry that had any value for its n
peace and happiness. Was any part of this "
alarm made by men who fought eight years Â°
lor the independence of the country ? No 2
such thing; they wished the country to re- t]
main in peace ; but they wished it also to be (l
prepared for war. He was opposed to the re- 0
foltition; but if itmult pass, he should wish. a
it to pass with the amendment. &
' Mr. Harper. When this resolution was I'
firft proposed, si appeared to him to be one or 'â¢>.
fnofe nugatory fheafures, whicJt >ai&ht Â«ttfeer 1
be agreed to or rejecle-l, without producing j ;
any cft'ssaij a'hi until he faÂ«t the resistance 1
which U>as given to tjie amendment, he re-
mainÂ».-d of the fame opinion but now he
found it was to fay to the French Nation, you
may comriiit against us injury atier injury, and 1
insult after insult, we npver ivill rejiftyou\
If this were not the inten.ion, why relist the
amendment? Taking this u> be thelntention, 1
he should bestow some observations upon it. 1
Gentlemen preach?dabout peace. They cry
Peace, Peace, as if we, holding thefcale of the 1
world, had the power to preserve it. Do not â 
gentlemen know that peace or war are not in 1
our power ? They do know it, and that all in 1
ourpower is to rejifl or Jubmit. Was not. the '
clamour which was heard about peace, in so (
many words, faying you muftfubmit, not on- â 
ly to what injuries you have received, but t >
what you may hereafter receive ? Was not
every advance, on our part, tor an adjustment
of differences, met with new injuries, and new
infultsf It would not be denied. Ifpeacewas
all that gentlemen wanted, they would take
the resolution in general terms, as proposed
to be amended ; but their opposing it shews,
that they have no objection to hostility, if it be
not again the French Nation, lie would not fay
whose ferhiants they were desirous of being,
but against whom they dread they are afraid
td lift up their finger. And this was the spirit
of peace which th'ey wished to preserveâa
which he deemed vile fimmiffionâa
spirit which was afraid, to complain, an3~
which met every new insult without murmur.
Mr. H. rejoiced thft this amendment was
made, because it had umnalked the intentions
of the mover and fiiftjiorters ot the original
proportion. They were now obliged to avow,
! it is not peace with all the world which wc
| want, but peace with Franceâa servile and
; abjeft submission to one nationâa nation, in
; behalf of whom they have heretsfore been
eager of war ; fbr, notwithstanding all their
cries at present ' for peace, peace, when there
is no peace, they have, on a former occasion,
been equally zealous for war. All their efforts
were then used to involve this country in war
upon the fide of the French Republic ; but
now, when meafiires of resistance are called
or, not against France, but to prevent her
' rom wounding her enemy through our fides,
ftheir cry is turned from war to peace. This
he repealed, and if they denied it, he would
refer to written accounts of their discourses at
that time, wliic-h would prove that they had
fought war against England, and an alliance
offenfive and difenflve with the French Re
public. At that time, he and those who ge
nerally vote with him, desired peace, and it
required all their skill ap.d.firmnefste preserve
it, and much obloquy was thrown upon theni
on account of. their exertions. The ground
which he and Ms friends then took was, lÂ«t
us firft try negociatlon ; if rt fait, we will
then join you in war. But these gentlemen
were, at that time, all in favour of war mea
fiires in the Srft mfiance. Whence now this
change of spirit? What is become of the spirit
of 1794, when it was said to be difgraceful to
negociate, and that it would be bafelyto sur
render the independence of our country to a
Foreign Power i He wilhed he could fee the
breaftsof gentlemen naw glow with the pa
triotism which then animated their brealts,
but, instead of rhis, what do We fee ? A spirit
of the most abjett kind. A spirit that would
leave all our property unprotected beyond
the limits of our territory ; so that our com
merce, from which is derived five sixths of our
revenue, is to be aba.idot.ed, left, in defend
ing it, we should give offenTe to the French
Republic. The committee were now told it
would be time enough.to prepare for war,
whenan invasion of ourcountry was attempt
ed. A'd why were they told this t Because
such an event is not likely to take place.
Gentlemen knew that all the hostility which
France .wishes tocommit against this country,
â  may be done by deflroying our commerce,
t But they are disposed to surrender this part of
: our rights, rather than refill ; and what fecu
-1 rity had we, that if the country were invaded,
> these gentlemen would then refill ? He appre
f he tided that the fame spirit which led them
; now to fubnjit, would continue to afhiate
r them.
Last year gentlemen were opposed to doing
- any thingwhich should alter the state of things,
t if this negociation, said they, fail, we will
then join you in aftive But now,
- when that time is come, they tell us we mufl
I (till fink lower, and become more degraded.
- We are to be contented, not only to fee our
II ships captured, our property deftrÂ»yed, our
- sailors fed i&chains, our revenue annihilated,
r but we mnft fee the army of the enemy at
- tempt tp land, before we will refill.
â , Mr. H. said he would bring his proofs to
g shew that gentlemen who are now so
ir loud in their calls ior Peace, were heretofore
II the fiippoi'iurs of a War System. For this
e purple, lie adduced, Mr. Monroe's view oi
it the ceriducl of the Executive of the United
e States, which, h* said was a publication
which had met with the aloft u,i ! i. .â  rded and
enthufiaftie applauseS from alt it; . arty, and
he read from it an extract of a le:te; rom Mr.
Monroe toour Secretary.pf Stave, jted Paris, p
Sep. io, 1795, page 209 u:,tl \to at ills book
in which he states it to be his opinion, " that
if a suitable attempt be made,to engage the
aid of the Frencli Government in fuppurt of
ourclaims upon England, it may bcr accom
plished, and that to secure fuectfeir will be tie
ceirary to take the pods and invaile Canada."
Would any man, said Mr. H. who shall
read this padage, fay that the system of these
p-entlsmen, is a Peace system i And besides
thispropofitign for taking the poftsand Suva
ling Canadaj the fame gentleman proposes
an advance to France of five millions of dol
ars. Yetthefe are-the gentlemen who now
are willing to fay to France " we will not
fight you ; we give you licence to do us all
the injury you please ; you may fifcout half a
dozen frigates which will be able to block up
our ports"; and we give you this notice, that
you may effeff your purpose with little te.x
ykence, and not prepare a large fleet tor the
purpose." R
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Giles)
whose zeal for keeping this country in an ab
solutely defencelefs thrte, has (urpalled all the
zeal he ever before displayed, except that
which he had Ihewn, on a formeroccafion, tor
bringing us into war, has told- 11s that peace iÂ»
'he belt thing we can have ; and that it would
be knight-errantry to attempt to defend our 1
property at tea. After our ministers have been
sent oft, and a decree pafied which muftde- p
(Iroy our commerce, and which had been al
lowed tobejuft cause of war, this was the j
language of that gentleman on the present ,
occasion, To shew this gentleman's conlif- ,
teney, and because his language was at that
time so spirited, so American, and carried
with it such force and energy,he could not for
bear reading anextratl from his speech on the
28th of March 1794, upon Mr. Dayton's mo
tion to sequestrate tfrit.th Debts. The ques
tion was not then whether we should arm for
our defence, but whether we (liould make an
attempt at negociation. The arguments of the
gentleman were, it was true, so me what ntil
placed, though they were nevertheless patri
aticÂ»nd admirable ; and he could not account
for the ltrange con'raft of his present fenti
menv.s on any other ground, than that he be
lieved the true interest of this country was
only to be effected by a treaty of alliance with 4
France, and war with her enemy. GsutU
mfcn who were on a former accsthon in favour
of spirited measures m delence of our rights,
and were on tv,is occafiorr, the fame, are con
tinent ; though their arguments might, not
altogether be properly timed, yet they were
radically right.
Mr. H. then proceeded to read and com
ment upon, Mr. Giles's speech on Mr. v
Dayton's motion, contrasting all along the
fentimeuts he then delivered, which were
in favour of the molt spirited lueafures
against England, with his present opinions
w'ith to France, in doing which
he paid t':e highest possible encomiums to
the talents and style of the gentleman from
Virginia.
After finifhing his contrail, Mr. H. spoke
of the propriety with which his colleague had
; introduced the account of the treatment which
Venice had receieved from the French Repub
lic. Yet gentlemen had asked whether thii
was a cause of war for us ? The circumltance
! they well knew was introduced merely to
, (hew the effect which a tame, fubmiflive con
duit was likely to produce ; but they had cho
[ fen to give it this turn, in order to avoid the
t point which it contained.
, Mr. H. said, he would bring another exam
, pie to the view of the committee. He rtteant
I -f-frat oi Switzerland. A'trcmpt'ST&i Â«uenipt
had been made by France on the indepen
j dence of that country. After going a variety
s of lengths,'thev effefted their purpose of dri-
I ving from thence that unfortunate elafs of
men, the Emigrants, who had been perfecu-
ted by those who had usurped all authority
-j 111 France, and who (ought the rights of hof
n pitality amongst thpm. New aggreflions were
n made ; they took pofielTion of a part ot the
j. Swiss territory and displaced the;r magi Urates.
r Seeing tha. every fubmiflion invited frqlh insult,
, they united hand in hand, took up arais, and
5 reinstated the magistrates who had been dil
placed, and resolved to live free, or die. â
lr What was the consequence of this spirited
conduct ? The French withdrew from their.
, r territory,difavowed the measures of their ge
s neral, and declared that they delired nothing
jg more than to leave the Swift in full poflelfion"
jot their rights..
u Let us, said Mr. H. take warning by this
energetic example of the Swiss. Let us now
e begin to resist. Let us declare, that we wifli
topreferve peace with all the world ; that we
allow that peace is good, but that we believe
; t independence is better ; that peace is defira
,e ble,but not at any priceâand then France
u will relinquilhheraggreffions.

tz, ' strati of a tetter from Mafiachufetts, dited j
,ltj March 2i, 1798.
. " The situation of our tommillioners in '
f France must be disagreeable, for I can hardlv 1
'y of any one more fÂ», than to tie in a con
la- fpicuous flation without the relpefl and confe
id, quenre which are eommon'y attached to it. A
[t man in fnch cafe must be every moment fubjeft
Â£ ; r to mortification and it would be better for him "â 
to be undiftinguilhed ; but the intijgnitiei thev â¢
may fufler will probably have a good effefl on '
their countrymen. When we have taken every *
honorable course to fatisfy the French govern- 1
ment, and they hive in every initSnce treated t
our overtures with contempt, it is hardly pofii- ]
e " b!e that hoacft men of any party can long con
crs tinue te oppose the measures, which national \
''!Â» honor and l'afety may demand. Perhaps there
will he no tjnascr'jatcJj- 1
"e the members of congrefn, far after they have *
v been together th-ee or four months, and have a
became heated by party difpntes, they forget
the fentimencs of the people that sent them, and
entertain views and p.-ojeifts to which their cen- !
ftituents are entire strangers ; befid -s, they have â ,
" taken fides, and it woulfl be unreafonabie to ex-
c " peÂ£l that political conversions (hould be inftan- '
at taneous
- J
>/ henfions of achangeinthe government of
country, or the relations Â«f its several pa>ts ; j
" but 1 hope there is no danger of this at ptvfent ;
and I flatter myfelf that the condiift of the "
e " French, which lieretofort has pradoced our
,a most dangerous diflentions, will now serve to
Ur uniteuo. At the commencement of their revo-
ft- lution, perhaps no part of the United States
Â» was more eothufiaflically attached to their cause Â°
" thin the people of N*ew-EÂ»gland : they eonfid- n
ered them as opprefled, and rejr iced m the prÂ»f
peiÂ£l Â»f their deliverance : this-attachment con- . b
u ' tinued so long as the measures of the French ,Ii
were defenfive, and for some time afterwards ; j ft
e and the many proofs that were given ot this at- j.i
tachrnent, probably oecafioned the Britilh fpoli- j j
l: ' at ions. But when the French aflumed the fiyle | ,
of a conquering republic, the people in this part ri
' e of the Union began to fufpefl thepurity of tiieii
"* motives ; add when they proceeded to violate a<
'' all the principles of society at home, and over
'â¢ run or insulted every state in Europe which bad j?
the name of a republic, or the femblarrce of iib
â t erty, tnd efpeehily when they wantonly attack- ! Cc
r ' ed us, and have treated our endeavors to appeal? i or
them, with insult; almost every one here is pt
convinced that the government of France is the tb
most unprincipled and the molt dangerous on re
( earth ; and it would now be difficult to find i re
. man who will judity their measures. But the
change has been gradual here, and the fame ,
, will happen I presume in the souther* states, .
' when the people have had opportunities for in- l "
formation, and leisure to refleft Our opinions be
of the views of France have otily altered a lit- an
tie sooner than theirs ; but they must be allow- an
ed time for the change, we mutt exerrift
a great deal of patience until that change takes
place. After ail, if we (hould be obliged to no
contend with France, or with any o'.her power, rÂ°
after proper attempts for accommodation have ex
faired, I hope and trust that the people of this an
eoiintry wibbc found as national and as well u thi
nÂ«ted as those of any other. Perhaps there will
fee j few that will prefer the interrfrs of the en
emy, for there are some traitors in all ceuntriet, f
but f am inclined to think that among the na
g tive Americans wc (hall not find an unusual pro- *Â°
portion of them."

:h , Mr. Gerry, dated Paris, Feb 2d, which
t ' j stated " that the ajairs bettveenthe republic and A
j' the United States remained in ftatu quo. and c
l e that all the .-.merican commifftoncrs -were in Pa.

te adive preparations were ft ill carried on in all c<! . l
J the ports of the republic for an invasion of
England, that he did not learn any Aineri. p'" 0 '
t | can vefiels had been carried in under the new ri g<

is pretty generally thought, were Mr. Gerry
e tbe only negociator, matters between thÂ« two j

4 report. [Daily Advertiser.
By this arrival we are verbally informed
. that the French still shew a serious design of n
invading England, as gun boat 6 to the nura
s ber of about 100 have been built at Havre, /
- and more building, which are to be manned and
- and manoeuvred agree bly to Tom Paine's T.
* plan, each carrying too men, and a can- Boe
* non, which cannon, by some machinery, is
to be launched on (here in a moment The A
- experiment has been made, and, we are told,
s answers ft> well, that the Frenchmen fay
they arc " fare of England!" A)!u
' Besides these boats, there were in the t0
port of Havre, two frigates with their fails
bent, and four more in great forwardnefs,
to aid in the expedition. _
We hear nothing of Buonaparte's difaf- re
feftionâbut, it is said, " he is the onlt vv
one capable of introducing the Army of l |
England tÂ« his Britannic Majesty."
On the 6th of Marfch, Capt. Fitch spoke m
an Englifti brig, which, a day or two be- in
fore, parted the homeward bound Jamaica Rl
fleetâall wdl.
A few days out, and capt. F. was boar- j,*
ded by three French privateers, one of rlo
which was the Buonaparte from Bourdraux *Â»'â 
âhis papers llridMy examinedâand fufftred
to proceedâtelling him, t\at if he had hean
from an Englifti port, he would have been
a good prize, as their late orders '""wete to

E N QJJ I R Y ; e Â°
INTO THI H
'ORIGIiâ  OF EPIDEMIC DISEASES. Al
THE Letters to Dr. Currie, which I puiiliflied â;
last autumn, led me co an investigation ot
the origin and phesomena of peftilsntial difealcs
in other countries, as well as in the United St res. rn
In the prof' cutioi* of the fubje&, new facts and J
principles continually opened to my view "nd n cc |
nally dettrmined me to trace back the In it or y ol y;
such diseases as far as the records of history ex
tend. For this pnrpofe, I have examined the pub- cq
lie libraries in New-York, New-Haven, Cam-
bridge and Boston, with a view to obtain all t.-.e b "
material fails which can illuflrate the fubjstft.ar.d
I have nearly colle<Sled all the material, for the
propofsd work.
The fatfts eelbcleJ will enable me to demon- P
ftrate that many of the common ideas refpeding; m
pcflilential epidemics, are untoundeu or extreme
ly incorrea ; and this in conference of medical pr
writers cenfidering an epidemic difeale as a detach- an
ed or isolated phenomenon in a particular coun
try ; rather than as conneÂ£led With other epide- vV
D>ics or other phenomena of nature in various th
parts ofthe world. The fails I have collc&ed
lead to certain deductions which are surprising to
mylblt, arid which will probably be new to many
others. Much light will bÂ« thrown on this dark
and perplexing fubjedl, as well as on natural phi
losophy.
The proposed woik will make a full sized oifa- m
, vo volume ; and exccutca well on fine paper, can- j
' not be afforded at lets than two dollars, bound, R
w'th the usual allowance to book-ftllrr?. Ae the E(
: ' compdstion will ewfl nÂ«t on!ygreat labÃr,but con
! fidnrable expel)cc, no more copies * i;l ke printed
" than to supply fubferibers. The'book will be rea
-â¢ dy for fubferibers early in the coming summer, and pc
I the holdeis of proposals. will be good enough to g,
return them to No. 40, Pine-flreet, by the firft of
. ] May. m
