This day a mail arrived from Hamburg,
which brings some intelligeace from Con
stantinople refpefting the Ftench fleet
According to these accounts, Admiral Nel
son found it in the harbor of Alexandria;
1, do but the Bay of Begnitres, formerly men
tioned as the place of aftioo, ison'iya little
to the eastward of Alexandria ; and this
disagreement in tht accounts does not to-
K validate the truth df an a&ioa having taken
f* 311 " place. Indeed this is confirmed by the Ac
counts from Rhodes, by which it appears
lit that some of the French frigitea which had
cfcape : from being captured fcy our fleet,
I had been seized by the Turks upon enter
ie I ing that harbour, in consequence of orders
| previously received from the Porte, which
may now be considered as having commenced
hostilities against France, or rather as having
retaliated on her for the firft aggrefiion.

lb- Saturday noon some Dispatches were re
ceived at the Duke of Portland's Office, at
Whitehall, from the Commandant at Jer

the regular packet. Every thing was quiet '

failed. At St. Maloes and the adjacent sea '
ports of France, there was a general calm, '
and no appearance of preparations of any (

mouth by the Telegraph, for the 44th re

to embark immediately on board the Wey- n

A GLORIOUS CONFIRMATION.
3y c.ipt "White, from Ham>Â«rgh, we
have the most complete ajfurauce of the
DEFEAT of the Fleet of Buonaparte

tain White touched at Yarmouth, and
on the sth of Oftober went on board Ad
miral Duncan's (hip. This intelligence
had been re; jived OFFICIALLY at the
Adrtiiralty Office, and inconsequence the
most enthullaftic rejoicings had taken
place through the whole fleet, and through
oa* England. Thus are our painful un
certainties once at an end the high

lie humbled and her all-grafpmg ambition !
completely checked. The tide of fortune ~
i, now turned, that huge Monster, who j
arrogantly stiles herfslf the Great Nation 1.
and who till this moment threatened to
entomb in her devouring maw all the na-
tions of the earth, will ere long be fore

enormous memberâperhaps be torn to |
jÂ»icces by the fury of her united and en
raged neighbors, ani her mangled limbs j
scattered in the air which (he has pollut- ]

REFLECTIONS
jLTpm the approaching Sejfion of Cong reft.
; IN the course of two werks, the Grand
> Council of the Nation the august afiem
f blage of, the colle&ed Dignity of the Conn
e try, are again to meet together. They f
meet to fix the fortune or to seal the ruin ! a
e of this great Empire. On their decisions ' r
, hang fulpended greater eonfequences than , 1
t ever before fell to the lot of an equal nutn- 1
, ber of men to decide on. Every member v
brings, or ought to bring with him to Con- "
egress, an added (lock of information, and b
r Â»f that kind, too, which, derived from ex- c
- perience, is of all others the most profitable.
The majority havt, during the recess, J\
- beheld the salutary effe&s of those measures 1
l in which they prevailed by dint of labor and c
, the- mod obltinate perfeveranee, against a a
1 gigantic opposition. r
s Experience, in the loud and penetrating Â«
r tone of reproof, has adrno lifhed the minori- b
, ty of the fatal tendency of their errors, âit t
> has uttered, anceafingly, a warning cry, to b
: deter them from perseverance in those den- h
> ous pathd through Which they would have "
led their country to ruin,âit" has convinced t
them, (if they are honest) that to unite c
1 their endeav rs with those whose superior d
. difcervment, the tell of time has eflablifhed, F
. in support of the dignity'and honor of the '
ration (her only interest) is now she f.l.i t
f atonement left in thsir power, for the mul F
z titude of evils and the heavy oppressions t
. with which their obstinacy in error has bur- J
r thened their country.
1 The period of the recess has abounded in
. events of immenfc magnitudeâEvents, each 1
e <f which, gaining in progressive importance a
$ on the last, furniflies alone wide range for J
wonder. c
In almost all of these our country has h d 1
a large (hare of interest : in many of them j
tl (h? has figured as a principal, From these .
in particular, are to be drawn irrefragable '
N evidences of the wisdom of administration, '
0 its prudence, its forefight, its penetration, '
h its patriotism. They prove to opposition i
v tha their resistance to arming'the mer- |
e chantmen, was ill-timed and^impoliticâthat j 1
their obje&ions to a N'aval E(labli(hment, <
were frivolous and nugatoryâthat their re- <
liance on the justice and honor of France,
â¢ was (hort-fighted and illusoryâand that the
f 6b'iruÂ£lions thrown in the way of efficient
1 measures and bottomed on that reliance, '
â  tended, consequently, to ruin.
While in the minds of opposition, a forci
ble appeal i made to penitence and contri- (
Â» tion. the cattle of Government acquires '
new mctives to c ntinued and encreafed en- <
. ergy. The Federalills, abandoning all tame
and half-way measures, (hriuld aft with a
zeal worthy t eir cause and. their country.
Let us no longer " peep our swords half-out
, their fcabbards,"âbu; dr w them forth a-d
f brandish them to vengeance In Â«<tjer words
r fix the country in a fettled and positive (late
r bv immediately declaring warâ Since all our
: degrading ess rts to obtain peace have re-.
- fulted in added degrada ion. *Si ce not
even a solemn emba(Ty of the mod eminent
(latfffmtn of America, â Since no', even the
labors of Doftor Georgs L gan could ef
e fe<Â£l it.
But unless the majority continue to dis
play a" u ceaCÃg watchfulnefs and care,
combined with encreafingencrgy and aclion,
and if the minority, bent refrlutely on" the
ruin of their country, p rfi'ft in their crimi
nal courses it is not <-*ifHcul" o affix 3 date
to the diflolution and downfall of the com- ]
monwealth.
This is a cafe, however, in which we have c
every thing to hop:*. D (appointment while ]

afli n emotions before unknown to theppo- t

his pri eâit difptls his infallibility, and a
wakens his common sense. ft humbles hit r
vanity, and while it tell him lie Las been t
wrong, convinces him be may be wrong a- v
gam. If the operation of these causes on i
the minority, (hould lead them to forego in 1
the patriotic duty of preferring their count J
try, the sweets of opposition ; aud if the |
majority, availinor themselves of their tri- h
ump'.s, to embolden them in. entetpriz c
(liould ad with avigour worthy of the events i
which depend on jr, the coifttry may Tet
outlast the ephemeral illutioii* of Gallic Re
pu!)lica::ifm.
The people of Amtrica have long been
abused by a deteltable banditti of foreign
invaders who through the medium of the
prefÂ« have found constant mtans of libels l
. ling truth and honesty, defaming with vile
the f.iireft and moll virtuous char
aderii, and of afTanlting with ceaseless and
envenomed malice a:id scurrility every offi
: cerof government, the form of government
I iticlf, and the charafler and principles of the
. whole American people. To thi? cause a.-'
lone i to be attributed the origin and con
tinuation of thai ardor prava or bad tem
per of irritation and ferment which has un
" ceafingly (hewn itfelf in one quarter or o-
F ther of the country, which has broken out
into formidable and threatening infurrcflion,
and more than once menaced the existence
â f government, and the freedom and inde
; pendence of the country.
Whoever will take the trouble to review
the affairs of this country for the last ten
years, will not f il to fee the force and ope
. ration of this influence molt fully and fatally
exemplified.
To tr ce the growth of it and to cxpofe
the leading afitors. would be an ufefal and
profi,able talk ; refervitig this, however, for
1 a time of fafety, it is efTential that we sub
stitute aftivr vigor and zeal in dragging these
venemou3 reptiles from their lurki ig; h'.les, I
for idle and inefficient fpeculatian? on the ;
evil- we daily fee them produce. I is vain j
any longer to think of efFe&ina; a reforma- 1
tion by argumentative appeals to the reason
and humanity of a set of mifcr ants who .
p fTefs neither. Let them be brought to |
! the bar of public jttdice, and made to an
swer its d mands. That man merits the 1
civic ciown who drags even one of these .
reptiles forth to lig' t ; and let no gentle- , â¢
man be deterred from the attempt by any j
considerations arising from the contempti
ble nature of their characters, their groveling j
! m?*nnefs or base depravity ; while the im
portant fafil exifta, that base and despicable
, as they are, there are thoufand3 weak e
' nsngh to be influenced by their machina
tion'-.
Who but remembers the torpid state in
which we (lumbering lay, when the warn
i ing voice of Mr. Adams, firfl roused us to
behold t e gigantic dangers which threat
ened and surrounded us ? Who but remem
bers the consternation produced by the <wjr
fpecch, and the howlings of the jacobins at
that timely alarm ? They had till then suc
ceeded in (tifling tfte spirit of the country ;
a milk-hearted disposition had banished eve
ry noble, every generous emotion, and ex
cept in the breads of the unpolluted few,
bafenefa every where lorded it. That spell,
that charm which confined to inaction, the
bed energies of the country, they saw he
had broken, and their hopes ot riot and ru
in fell in d-efpair. Then was laid the axe to
the root of jacobinismâthe tree has since
continually withered ; its very is un
dermined, and the scattered branches laid
prostrate on the eaith, whence they emit
their hollftw, rustling founds, unheeded as
the murmuring wind, except by fouls so va
pid and inane as to want capacity to trace
the connexion between a cause and its con
sequences.

â  to within four thousand dollars of the whole

It appears that one Isaac Davis, a Car

who died of the Fever, were the sole agents
in this nefarious bnlinefs. Davis had set up
his carriage and pair, an*l pretended that an

A CAUTION TO THE PUBLIC.
JOHN A. SH AEFFER, <rf Philadelphia, -who has
for a few years pafi bc en in thefouihern States,
has had the effrontery to draw Bills of Ex
change on Timothy Pickering, Esq. Secretary of
State, and mylelf.and by that means hss defrauded
a number of persons of their money, deceiving
them by an exhibition of letters and papers with the
names affixed of divers public chara&ei s and repu
table merchants highly recemmendatory of said
ShaefTer ; to oae of tbefe papers I find my name
fublcribed, but luo not know the man ; these arc
villainous forgeries! To prevent further imposition,
I have to request the printers of Newspapers in the
1 United States tp publilh this for the bendit of their
