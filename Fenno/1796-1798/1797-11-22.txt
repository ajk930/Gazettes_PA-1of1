Certainly it cannot be much his Hon- Frenc
our as a man of science, or a divine, to fay
that the reasonableness of this (the christian)
revelation is not to be proved or examined; Plea!
because, as he fays, revelation implies informa- th
tion of something which reason cannot dijeover ;
and therefore mufl be different from all the de- Thoi
duaions of reafan. This it seems comes in
as a denial of a proposition advanced, some "
where, by Doftor Priestley* vizâthat chr'tf- eomi
tianity, be/ides being proved to be true, mufl be cies
fhetvn to be rational. Now the review , a fe\
makes Dost. Wharton fay that we have ( ing I
nothing to do with the rationality of the j evili
doftrines of revelation, but limply, are these j exist
doSrines (alluding to the atonement and not i
probably to the trinity in some points) com- of t
municated to us by divine revelation, or are extr
they not ? j tc
I I believg the reformers did not take this tjeer
ground, in some of their disputes with the und
catholics, about tranfubftantiation and other deej

The reformers asserted the doftrines of C<
tranfubftantiation to be absurd and cÂ«ntra- th
ry to the evideace of sense ; and, thÂ«refore, no

teoufnefs and justice, as the other is to the I ki

s e " take to be the effeft they have in destroying, "
east or the tendency they have to destroy, in ti
fa the-minds of people, the doftrines alluded o
to in doftor W's pamphlet, which as far as I c
I can colleft from the review may be the 1;
trinity, atonement and perhaps original fin, it
for they generally go together in thÂ§ fame si
view of chriftianity. r

â - Thoughts on the modern prevalence of Bank- as
n ruptcies. Tl
,e " Perhaps, in the present situation of the fui
f- eommercial vvgrld, the number of bankrupt- ma
be ' cies which have of late happened, may claim frc
sv ! a few thoughts, as a fubjeft highly intereft
re ing to a mercantile nation. To remedy the thi
ie i evllentirelyis perhaps impoflible, while trade mi
fe I exists, andjortune is capricious ; but ought a 1
id ! not some diftinftion to be made in the eye ga
n- |of the world, between the situation of the an
re extravagant unthinking villain, the hasty an
speculator, and the worthy man, who has th
is I teen ruined by their schemes, ftrugghng en
ie under the burden of a numerous family, and tli
ev deeply aff*Â£ted with his fallen condition ? m
p- A man in the situation of the lattef, is most re
_a deserving comparffion ; on him the creditor m
ie ought not to wrack that vengeance which
in is only destined for guilty heads. Yet how
hie often do we feÂ« him reduced to poverty and
- want, exposed to the misery of a jail, with- "
u- I out friends and without help ! A man in
x- this situation is an objeft of pity ; he who
n- refufes it is unworthy of a better lot. On j.
ic- the hand, the more splendid spend- j
nd I thrift, who indulges himfclf in all the fafhi
he 1 onable follies of sensuality and extravagance,
rf- I who perhaps wai the ruin of the former,
iii. whose credit was never supported but by
an the most ruinous means, viz. " wind bills,
m- and personal aflurance," often meets with c
ho that pity which the other has never found :
ie- in a short time surmounts his difficulties of
ty. seeming embarraflmente â¢ overleaps the
ip- I bounds of prudence, and begins again his
tie- I ruinous career with undiminifhed splendor ; ((
ce- alike the censures of the world,
nts I and of his own conscience, hackneyed in
ew iniquity. Ought not the one to be admired
iiat in his misfortunes, and the other reprobated ,
er- in his splendour, and detested, though fur-
nee roundefl with the glare oftinzeled shew ?
nal As matters have flood for some time past, , j-j
: it I there is no man who deals extensively but
all must fufFer : and the fraudulent bankrupt is
ex- generally the one who lives most splendidly.
do When we trace bankruptcies to their
its source, we' generally find extravagance at '
ave home, ruinous speculations, or misfortunes

i of I Could not some mode be adopted to eheck
tra- the growth of this growing' evil? Could 1
jre, I not some mark of odium be itamped upon
the I them by the public ? The wife most surely
â¢ve- j would applaud a scheme for that purpose : |
uch j 'tis a pity it has not been already put in ex-
I ecution. For instance, when it was clearly
lent proved that a man had fairly ruined himfelf
igh- by heedless expenditures, which he well
the I knows his circumftanccs could not admit of;
tri- I if he is a member of a mercantile society,
' of I and it is insinuated that either fraudulent'
deas I practices, or fomÂ« other cause, owing to
I himfelf, have been the cause of his failure,
loc- I why not make inquiry ? and if that is found
ling I ont, ought he not to be expelled society by
pre- I the unanimous voice of honest men ? AV e
lion are told, shame ids more powerfully than
erife principle ; and lam persuaded, a man will
lifm. I often hear general general surmises with a
jring deaf ear, who would start at the thoughts
hem- of open reprobation. This must, however
;heir be prudently and. carefully examined ; but
for may be done after due investigation. On
that I the other hand, could not an iuftitution be
alig- made to bring forward the unfortunate, and
I fuccpur the distressed citizen. The rich who
t the*] fear not the hour of adversity, may perhaps
m I spurn at the proposal ; but the sober think
ing, ing man would approve. Suppose an irtfti
r, in I tution was formed for- the express purpofi
udec! jof relieving decayed r bants, after the
"aras circumftancesattending their failure were du
e the ly infpefted by a committee : I dare fay
I fin, it would meet with encouragsment ; and a
fame small annual contribution too trifling to be
I regarded by the opulent would do the bufi
word j ness, audit is too ufeful a scheme to be dif
r and I regarded by the humble. Were this propo
ility, Â»fed by some patriotic gentleman, I dare fay
mor- ' it would meet with encouragement : and
n are surely to be the means of depressing and
ano- affronting the villain, and encouraging the
; he- * honest and virtuous, is an undertaking wor
gorfd thy of man.
gious j If'.his is thought worth inferring in your
-e of ' work, it may perhaps bring forward some
tural, | more able arguments, and be the means of j
f rev- j at least making the villain blufli, while the
o ap-*i honest cannot but commend.
iy as I I am, indeed, of opinion, that had this
holi- inftitutfon been formed for some years past,
y be- the payments to real objefts would have been
very few ; but in all probability, the evil
intro- will iucrca'fe, till the public take the alarm,

i of Joseph MAria Pancrazi.
" Wits live nbfcurely, men know rot how ;Â«r die 11
obfcnrÂ»ly, men nrt when " ascham.
" Fortune has rarely condescended to be in
Â° the companion of merit, iiven in these en- m
lightened times men of betters have lived in w
â¢" obfeurity, while their reputation was wide- ce
[' ly spread ; and hare perished in poverty, at
'' while their works were enriching the book- w
r ' fellers.
That generous warmth of foul which en- &
couragement might have eulivenedintograti- o

j too frequently been extingujfhcd by the k
tears negleft has eaufed it to filed. W ant n
' ; e and dependence check the flights of genius, a
obftrutt evÂ«ry noble effort of the mind, and ti
" chill the genial current of the foul."
A person endowed with superior mental si
faculties in distress, was, by the antients, n
very.aptly shadowed under the emblem of t
Minerva in a poor habit, having her right c
hand chaiued to a huge stone lying 011 the p
ground, whilst her lfft hand, which is fur- ii
' nifhed with a pair of wings, is held aloft ; li
â  fignifying the ardor with which Genius as- n
14 pires to the noblest things, whilst unhappi- p
J-' ness of concision restrains its endeavors and 1
'. it prevents the accomplifliment of its defiVes. e
A little memorandum by the late Tho- t
le * mas Hollis, Esq. (the munificent benefac-i j
"k -tor of Harvard university) led to these hu- 1
militating temarks. t
There was something very affe&ing in th- f
, fate of Father Pancrazi. The learning and \
, the merit of this excellent and hospitable c
man were known and admired throughout !
Italy. Yet these empty applauses", some- t
times leavened wi'h malignant erivy, were 1
jj the only rewards obtained from his induftri- I
out application to literary pursuits, his ex- t
' tcnfive bounteous generosity. 1
Wholly engaged In his fhidies and his deva
"to tions he took no thought for the neceflary ]
supplies of life. His resources, every day 1
n( j leflening in a<fts of charity and hospitality, i
. and in the purchase of rare and valuable
books, were at length exhausted. He be- !
, came extremely poor. It was now, howev
er, that he began his much admired work on
j the Antiquities of Sicily ;* this ht compo-
fed, as the celebrated Johnson fays he did
his dictionary, " with little afliftauce from
the learned; and without any patronage of
Q n the great ; amidst inconvenience and dif
traftion, sickness and sorrow and rsuch of
his time was unavoidably spent in making
provifipn for the day, which was passing o
vcr him. Many who read his boÂ«k with
admiration knew of his neceflities, yet no
jij' one relieved tbem. "In the autumn of
>f- 1 75j?' fays Mr. Hollis,f he lodged in a
'i " ThJatin convent, the convent of his order,
at Naples. There he was attacked by a vi
r olent fever, which impaired and broke his
constitution. In that feeble state, however,
( he applied to his work ; and, in order more
speedily to publish the third volume of it,
found means, in the year 1753, -to fell a few
' " rare medals which he had colle&ed, to tl e
'?Â° king, by whom he had the honor to be per
fonaUy known and refpe&ed. The superior
and '^ e conve,,t fÂ° Bie ' lc>w g ot intelligence of
? e that traafaftion, claimed the money arising
C from the sale of the medals.for the uses of the
convent, and obtained it._ When Father
Pancrazi became apprized of the event, he
!went diftrafted direftly ; and after languifli
ing, with intervals, miserably some years, at
length ended his wretched life."

* which support each otherâthe firft is, the
( leading public charafters think the mass of
the people are opposed to government and
that they are therefore unfaithful if they do
notlikewife oppose and abufeall the officer*
of government, whereas the firft is not the
truth, and the second is a great fault : a
e very little explanation would regulate this
âthe people of Virginia would be viewed
e in their true chara&er, and very different
means would be used for popularity. There
11 would not then be found men whose politi-'
eal eclat was acquired by epithets of a"bufe

it friends of their country, of good order,

id tious, intriguing and fetjitious.
Whenever truth (hall it will be
al found that the Americans generally, from
s, north to south think and mean alike. Atr
of tempts have been made to eftablilh an un
it ceasing principle of civil discord, so that by"
le playing off party against party, the leaders
r- in the opposite scale might acquire a falfe pc
t ; litical character and establish an opinion a
if- mong their followers, that they alone fup

employed on the floor of Congress to fet
o- tie points which men of business could ad*

u- In a few uays after the meeting of Congress
the fides are formed, and although walls re
h- fpund with speeches, and the papers groan
id with the publication of them, yet any fpeak
>le er knows that he will'make no converts and
ut all wait like puppets, till the ehampions are
ic- tired. What then does this mean ? 'Tis to
â re keep up the spirit of partyâto conceal the
ri- truthâto induce the people of one region
x- to think that thofeof another intend to make
ty. them beasts of burthen and so -vice versa.

About sixty fx-patricians have been arrested, and

Buonaparte a reinforcement of French troops.
They are arrived, and are lodged between the
new and old walls of the city.
BORDEAUX, OSlober 3.
We read in No. 8 of the Grandeur, that the
General Buonoparte being informed that the
Emfieror had formed a secret league with the
court of Rome, the objed of which was to sur
prize him, had himfelf turned the tables upon
those two perfidious allies, and that his frfl
toup-dt-milin had been tofurround thirty thou
fant men, and make them lay down their arms,
,:nd that he meant to proceed to Rome, to chajlife
them into goodfaith, and open the eyes of credu
lous nations, by breaking the talisman of a cun
tting court, which has owed its too long enjoyed
power, only to ignorance andfuperfiition.
Thus it fecms reserved for the hero of Italy,
to efface from the lift rf 'th: fates of Europe,
this modern Rome, who has inundated the uni
verse with blood and tears.
We arc assured that â  Cerler, contra Sir for
.//>â¢ horse furniture if thl ctrmy of Italy has
written home, announcing the jiguature of the
treaty of peace with Emperor.
PARIS, September 23.
We can now announce without fear, tli 1
Buonaparte has furrounued the troops of
the. Emperor, beyond Udine, and that in
the fpaee of 6 days or more, he will be at
the gates of Vienna, unless a peace, the
most honorable and fatisfa&ory, both to us
and the Italians, (hall be consented to by his
Imperial majesty. (Amides Lois.)
Notwithstanding the above, they write
from Roveredo, 41b September, thus :
Roveredo, Sept. 4.
" The Gazette of Padua, of the 24th
August, after having related the entertain
ments which had been given to Buonaparte
during his (lay in that city, adds, the com
mander in chief, has declared to the troops
of the divifior\ of Mafiena, which he came
to review, that peace is made with Portu
gal, it is hoped for with England, and I am
going to Uiiine, in order to conclude peace
with the Emperor. Buonaparte departed
in the night forTrevess."
The following letter from Italy, which is
authentic, would induce one to believe that
not the best miderftanding exists between the
Court of Vienna and the Prince of Conde.
It is written by an officer of rank, under
PrincevCharles, to his brother ! it as fol
lows :
" Our generals are much surprized at
the new conspiracy difcovcred in France,
and are sorry it existed. All affiire that our
court had no hand in it.
" The Prince of Conde came the 12th
September to visit Prince Charles : but was"
received with the greatest coldtiefs. Prince
Charles even told us that he was sorry to fee
that Conde was here, and that but for him
a definitive peace would have now been
signed.
" W hije at dinner, Conde received dtf
patches from Ruflia, relative to hi* depar
ture for that country with his army. It i 9
Certain that he is countenanced only by that
court and England. He is totally abandon
ed by ours. We even have orders to arrsft
and try all those who shall be found recruit

COUNCIL OF FIVE HUNDRED.
Jacomin begged leave of the cpuneil, to
relate some details concerning the transac
tions, at Point-Saint-Efprit.âLeave was
granted.
I come, said he, to give you some intqr
efting details which have been transmitted
to me by the commiflioner of the executive
directory, nearthe department of LpDrome.
He informs me that the royalist army which
was fotmed near Vauclufe and the depart
ment 6f La Bwuit, hat been dilperTe37~and
that Saint Chriftol, who afted as general of
the two councils, has been arretted.
Jacomin then prefentedthe letter from thÂ«
commiflioner ; the fallowing is an extraft
from it;
" I was informed," fays the commiflion
er, " two months ago, that a band of cnt
throats was forrfiing. The chiefs remained
secret. Fear hindered them from uniting,
jhey only dispatched parties of 25 men to
lay wait near the roads, seize the meflengers
and couriers of the mail, and scour the coun
try, where they aflaflinated therepublicans."
" However, this armed force at length
made its appearance two days ago in a bo
dy of 400 men. No one could discover
their deligns ; Saint Chriftol and Berignan
were the chiefs. At length they made an
attack on Point-Saint-Efprit, and got pof
feflion of the citadel. We had at that time
no knowledge of what was pafling at Paris.
The courier of the 19th which did not arrive
till the 26th,- contained nothing but dis
patches, which were of little importance."
" I feÂ«d you herewith the manifefto of
this Saint Chriftol, who calls himfelf geaer
al of the two councils. Upon the news of
the invasion of Point-Saint-Efprit J gave the
neceflary ordti's to destroy the germ of this
new Vendee, which, already confiding of a
bout 1500 men, began to make itfelffeared,
and to levy contributions. My orders were
executed with the rapidity oflightning and
the brigands retired frory Point-Saint-Efprit
, carrying j&'itli them 5 pieces of cannon."
"Generals Almera and Tiflon made a
jun&ion at Carpentras, and marched in pur
suit of the rebels. It is believed our troops
j have come up with, and defeated them ; for
a letter from the administration informs us,
that Saint Chriftol has been arrested."
Jacomin then read the manifefto of Saint
Chriftol, of which the following is an analy
sis . " The tocsin of tyranny has been foun
ded in the palace of the dirediory ; the con
j ftitution his been violated ; your mod faith
j ful representatives are fallen underthe poign
' ards, and soon you will fee the bloody scenes
i of Orange, and Carpentras renewed. What
;do 1 fay ? Such horrors are but an imper
! fe& sample of what i 3 preparing for you.
It is on your bloody carcases, on the palpi
tating breaftsofyour wives, they will "execute
their infamous projects. Rouse yourselves,
then, from your lethargy, rally at the voice
of Willot and of Pichegru, whose humani
ty have covered them with glory. Hasten
to join the brave army, that waits for you
under the walls of Orange."
" It is to you, brave youths, that our
voice is particularly addressed.
not to reft untill we have delivered you from
your tyrants." This manifefto is dated the
12th of Sept. corresponding to the 25th
Frnftidor.
Jacomin also read a letter from General
Almera to the administration of La Drome,
which states that the brigands retreated in
disorder, after having mafiacreed 7 or 8 per
sons, and levied a sum of 30,0-0 livres ; it
' concludes by announcing that St. Cariltol
is arretted.
The council ordered the printing of these
pieces, and that honourable mention be made
of the condudt of the national guard of
Niftpea, and of the administration of the
department of La Drome.

The Minuter of the Interior,
LETOURNEUX.
We learn from Milan, that an order of
the general in chief, dated head-quarters,
near Udine, announces that all the divisions
of the army were to be put in motion on
the 2d Vendemiare (23d Sept.) % The
fame order commands all the generals of di
vilion to complete the furniture of their
troops ; to have forty cartridges for each
soldier, without counting those in the cas
es ; to fend into the strong places the worst
armÃ ; to form their trains of_ artillery ; to
fend immediately to head-quarters an ac
count of the cavalry ready to march on the
2d Venderaaire ; to fend the sick into the
hospitals ; to provision all the places foitifi- ,
ed in a manner fit to fuppqrt a liege. In !
short, all the measures of precaution which
announce the renewal of war, are taken,
fnd die generals are rendered p'erfonaliy re
sponsible for their execution.
The CommifTiinaire Ordonnateur in chief
is busily engaged in seconding the views of
gen. Buonaparte. The march of the con- j
voys, the .route which they are to take, the
places of deposit or reft, and the meeting Â«- 1
gain of each service, are regulated in a letter
to citizen Lambert at Milan.
News is this moment arrived from Venice,
that the correspondence of thfc powers of
Italy and the cabinet of Austria have been
intercepted by this re-union. It is true,
that this may appear extraordinary, and
that it coincides with the royal
cotifpiration ef the interior ; btit we do
not believe that it is much to be feared.â
There are fqme princes in Italy v.-hose
thrones have not been overthrown, only be
cause Jupiter has not yet frowned. A ges
ture, a word, or a blow, or the signature of
a certain man, â  will be fufficient to dellroy
the work of several ages. In the mjan
time, citizen Marmoiit, aid de camp of the
general in chief, is gone to_ Rome ; and the
French fleet, composed of twelve men of
war and seven frigates, have failed four days
since. on the brink of great events.
The members condemned to transporta
tion, who have been cendufted to Rochfort,
yet complain of the want of attention from
their pretended partizans. The reception
which they have received on their route,
ought toliaveundeceived them in this refpedt.
Indifference, indignation, or contempt, have
been the only sentiments which have been
manifefted on their pafiage. They were
embarked on board the Valiant the ift Ven
demaiare. The following is an exadt lift :
Laffond Ladebat, Barthelemy, Lartts;,
Barbe Marbois, Berthelot, Lavilleumois,

Letellier, attached to the Ex-Diredtor
Barthelemy, who voluntarily followed him. -
The covette failed the 2d Vendemiare, in
the morning, with a favorable wind, and was
soon out of fight. -
The hopes and wifhe's of the "friends of ,
humanity are again deceived,and the authors
of the troubles of France will again fee their
perfidious intentions recompensed by a rene
wal of the horrors of war. How, indeed,
could it be expedted, that the emperor, who
has conflantly aimed at our deftrudtion,
(hould consent to have peace, at the instant
in which he was driving to excite troubles
in the interior of the republic, and constant
ly favoring the enemies of the revolution ?
Had he not in them stronger auxiliaries than
in his own soldiers ? He certainly had, and
wvUoDni norWdKl all lie couHTto excite
our divisions, and to favour the conspira
tors, which has been the true cause ef his
backwardness in concluding the proje&ed
peace.

On the nth Sept. the Executive direc
tory sent a mefTage calling the attention of
the Council of Five Hundred, to the law
of August 2, which ordered the emigrants
in the service of England; who w<;re fnip
wrecked near Calais, and among others, the
noted Cboifeul, to be condudted into a neu
tral country, and set free, leaving them in 1
this manner at liberty to rejoin the British
and fight as before, against the republic.â
The late confpirat.ors had adroitly recom
mended and carried this meafqre by surprise
ltnder vain pretexts of humanity aqd justice. [
The Direftory suggests the propriety of
; transporting those emigrants with the late
conspirators to the coast of Bouth America,
in order to prevent them from again carrying
arms against the republic.

It you you would with to go into Cape Cod

When up with Racejpoint. which is very
bold, and about three leagues to theweftward of
