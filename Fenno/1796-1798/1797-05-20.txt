president's MESSAGE, JAN. 19, '9;.
Mr. Horrifon, Diflria Attorney oj New-Tori,
to Mr. Pieiering, Secretary of State.
New-Tori, nth December,
Sir,
Mr. Adet's long and extraordinary note
of the 15th ultimo, could not fail of exciting
both furpiifg and attention. The variety of
ill founded charge* which it contained against
thjr molt revered and tefpeaable charaSertin
our country, and its general drain of censure
upon the wife and impartial measure* of go
vernment, had a natural tendency to make
the reproaches it contained upon inferior in
dividual* be considered rather as marlci of
honourable diftin&ion, than as infliftive of
dilgrace. Under these imprrfHons, and con
scious that ai far aÂ« I was implicated in his
censures, they were wholly unmerited, I had
balanced with myfelf whether it could be pro
per to add any further statement ta .those
communications refpe&ing the cafe of La
Vengeance, whieh had already been tranf
mittcd to the principal officersof government.
Left, however, any thing Ihould be warning
to a complete vindication of the courts and
officers, as far as 1 was personally concern
ed, and in deference to the contained
in your letter of the 10th inft. I (hall briefly
recapitulate the eircumftances attending the
several suits against the privateer, with the
particular reasons that influenced my condud
as profecator for the public< I trust that
the detail will fully confirm not only the pu
rity of those motives by which 1 was aduated
but also the propriety of the mcafures which
I thoyght it right to pursue.
About the latter end of June, ot begin*
ningofjuly, 179J, the piivateer JL,a Ven
geance irrived with a valuable prize, in the
harbour of New-York, at a time when 1 was
absent from tbe state, upon a tour to tbe east
ward for the recovery of my health. Upon
the ad of July, if I am rightly informed, a
fifit was commenced on the admiralty fide of
tbe ijiftrift court, by the Spanish consul on
behalf of thtoiiginal owner of the prize, u
pon an allegation that the privateer bad been
fitted out in the United States. This cause
was commenced in my absence, by the advice
of colonel Hamilton and Mr. Troup. 1 had
Mo participation in the business, nor any
knowledge of it ;<t-though if I had been ap
plied to, I should not have thought it incom
patible with my station to have been original
ly concerned for the libellant; as the free ex
ercise of profeflion in all cause* where the
' United States are not parties, the
diftrift attornie*. Before my return to New
York, the caU(Â« had already made some pro
gress ; the libel was filed, the prize arretted,
and a claim, I think, instituted by capt. Be
rard on behalf of one Jacques Rouge, whom
he aliegcd to be the owner of the privateer.
Mr. Adet's insinuation, therefore, that the
prize tuat arrcfled in confejuenee of any cxer
srtionor appearance of mine, i* totally unfound
ed, and to be clafled with the other ground
lefÂ« reproaches by which his note it dilia*
guiflted.
U,Â»>n my return the Consul of the King
of Spain at New-York* complained to me
in my official capacity, of a violation of law
on the part of the privateer, in consequence
of which a Spanish subject had been injured.
Thi* complaint was entitled to attention, both
from its own nature and the situation of the
complainant. I could be under no improper
bias from any connexion with the prize cause
even >if I "Â»as capable of being so biafled ;
because, a .hat time, 1 had no concern in
it ; and > erefore Mr. Adet'* observation
that 1 aftti. " without laying aside my of
fice of attorney for the captured', it equally
unfounded with the one above noticed.
Upon making tbe enquiries which 1 sup
posed requisite, 1 found at lead a probability
that the complaint refpefling the privateer
was true. This probability arose from what
I confideredas affording the certainty of ma
terial proof; and therefore, in conformity
with my doty, I commenced a prosecution
grounded upon the statute, prohibiting the <
arming of piivateers in our ports. In the
course of proceeding against the privateer, it
was cianifeft, that the cause of the United 1
States and that against the prize were sub- ;
ftantially the famt, and it was agreed that i
the evidence taken io the one cafe should be 1
vfed irt both. After some time, col. Hamil- ]
ton's numtrou* engagement* rendered it itn- I
prafticafcle for him to attend constantly to (
the examination of witnefTet, and at qneftion* 1
ferofe with .refpeft to the caefe against the 1
prize, wLv.-h did not emtrge in that ot the 1
privateer, 1 waa engaged to aflift at connfrl
in the prize cause, continuing alone at 10 e
very thing that rcfpe&cd the public prosecu
tion. This I may aver to have been carried I
on with the utmost faiineft on the part ofth# 1
United States, and no methodt whatever 1
were employed to delay the dccifion, which, <
however wit necefTarily retarded, in part by 1
the time consumed in examining the .numerous
witnefcj produced on behalf of the claimantt,
and in part, by the calamitous situation of <
New-York at tbat period. Perhaps too, <
there never were caufea in which more con 1
tradiÂ£lory-and irreconcileable evidence was of- I
fcred, and in which the mindt of the auditors <
were more divided at to the real (tale of fall*
The judge of the diftrift tusk a conb'Jctablc I
1 time to examine the evidence and foim his
opinion, and tho' hi* decilion was in favor of
'he claimant!, yet he expressly declaied that
tf.ere wat probable cause for the leizure,
which hat ever been considered at fufficient
to juftify a prosecution on the part of the
I public, and 1 believe that whoever will exa
mine the mast of jarring evidence that was
taken upon this occasion, will accord in
that opinion, tho'he may think that under
all the circumftancet, the fadlt were too
doubtful to warrant a condemnation. To
the judge'* sentence upon this prosecution, I
thoughr it reasonable to submit on the part
of the public, and as one of the courftl in the
prize'raufe I united with my alTociate in re
commending the like fubmiflion in that cause
j alf i. These are all the obf-rvations which I
think it can be pr per to make with refpeft
to the firft cause commenced against the pri

FRENCH INFLUENCE.
No. 111.
: MR RVSSEL,
That we may be enabled the more justly
to form aa ellitnate of the degree and extent
of the French influence in this country, it
will be proper to pause here a moment and
refled upon the nature of public opinion, how
it is to be colle&ed, aud in what manner if
may be excited, created or directed.
In every civil society the majority unless
roused by some appeal to their paffio.is or
interelt, are quiescent and inactive. In a
republican government like ours, the great
body of the people are perfeftly easy, and re
pose with confidence on the rulers whom they
have freely elefted and whom they know to
be equally interested with themselves in the
promotion of the public welfare and bappi
nefs.
But in every society however happy the
general (late of it may be, there will be per- j
sons of some one of the following descripti
ons: Relllefs, uneasy spirits impatient of ref
tiaintâfour, morose malevolent heart*âdis
posed to view the fair objects of nature and
art, the beautiful fyllem of law*, order and
public happiness, with jaundiced eyesâde
pressed, defpeate, profligate abandoned wret
ches, possessed of a gambling spirit, desirous
of change, or vain ambitious mind 9, purse
proud men, but of dull and feeble talents, who
think that their merit* are overlooked, and
who wilh an overturn for the fake of gratify
ing their rage for diftindioH. These varioua
descriptions abound snore or less in different
countriesâln England Mr. Butke compute*
them at one fifth of those who think at all, !
but supposes that unless carefully watched,
they are fufficiently numerous to overthrow
the government. In this country, Ido not
believe that more one tenth of those who
are capable of forming any opinion for them,
fclves are of any of the foregoing descripti
ons, but though fa defpjoable in number*
and chara&ers, yet they are so subtle, a&ive,
persevering, indefatigable and organized, that
we have seen them effeft in a few weeks an
almost total change in the opinions of their
fellow citizens.âAssume the language and
authority of the people, and threaten the ve
ry exillencc of government.âTaught this
truth, partly by theii experience in their own
country and partly by observation of the A
merican chara&er, the emissaries of France
early learned how to acquire an influence, and
had almost discovered how to obtain a domi
nion over the opinion* and conduft of the o
pen and unfufpe&ing AmericansâFrom the
peace of 1783 until the period when the Ja
coLin fa&ion had ercfted a new despotism in
Fiance, upon the ruins of the old, no parti
cular oceafion* exilled to call forth the intri
guing spirit of the French governmentâ.we
do not therefore find any particular exercise
of this their darling propensity.
They contented themselves with filling up
the full quota of diplomatic and con! fular
agents, who were w.ell employed in watch
ing every interesting movement of our go
vernment, and who were ready mailhalled to
commence effective operations as event* or
oceafion* might require. Such an oceafion
unfortunately for'this until now happy
couafy too feon presented itfelf. The hrft
Hep* towards liberty which the French na
tion adopted, having for thcobjeft, (imply a
dimunition of the royal prerogatives, and an
amelioration of the condition of the common
alty and peasantry were received in this coun- ,
try with universal and uufcigned pleasure. ,
Our public paper* teemed with congratula
tion* on the aufpiciou* event.âWhen there
fore the mild, humane, and philofophi: War
ville, and hi* accomplices, of the Cirondill
fafiion, aimed the sanguinary steel against '
the head of their unfortunate monarch, (to j
whom, if to any of the French nation, we
were under obligation)â When they perceived
that all Enrope flood aghast at the horrid
fpedaele, and that incensed humanity was
urging combined nations to vindicate her
rights, it was to be expefted that they (houid
turn tbeir views to America, as their only
friend. Selefting then one of their most dar.
ling and intriguing spirits, a man who has I
already proved his abilitie* against the devÂ»- 1
ted head* of the unhappy Genevan*, and re- ]
calling firem this sountry a minister wbo had 1
too much honcfty and too great friendfhip 1
for nt to be trusted, they sent out thi* emif- i
fary to draw ilofcr the bonds of fraterniy, I
which untied the ltuÂ» republics. Every art. !
ful device, every ingenious scheme, every <
plausible, every fafcinating sentiment was to 1
be suggested to cntnrp os. To pleale our .
vanity we were to be told, that the French .
revolution was but 20 emanation of our own.
| That a spark from America had lighted the
I holy Sameâto gratify resentments yet warm
r| âto rekindle jealousies hardly txtinguifhed,
; j to rcfufcitate injuries not yet healed, we were
I reminded of British tyrannvâBritifh treache
ry, and Britilh cruelty. But above all, to
the idle andihe desperate, who have
: ever since been the warmed friends of French
' principles, they preached the mild, persuasive
1 and irrefible dudlrint i oWiiserty and equality.

COMMUNICATION.
THE speech of the President of the United
States has excited the lrvelieft approbation of all
real Americans. It may be justly called a true
â American/fetch. It breathes in every line gen
uine patriatifm. It came from the heart of a
tried patriot, and was addreiled/e the heart of
patriots alone. There was nothiag wavering in
it j no little trick to catch a transitory appro
bation from the discontented, or to soothe the
faflious. It was the explicit language of the
firft magiftrite of the nation, difciofing to his
fellow citizens the honest sentiments of his
â  heart, expreffmg with a proper feeling and sen
sibility, the wrongs done to his injured country,-
and his determination to attempt to obtain re
dress j while at the fame tjme it manifefted.hu
mane anxiety to avert the calamities of war by
temperance and negotiation. In tracing the a
trocious attempt to separate the people from
their government, it glowed with that patriotic
fire, which animated JOHN ADAMS in 17,%
and in 1)54, when another nation wi(hÂ«l to
deprive 11s of our liberties. The old patriot a
gain (hone forth in all his youthful ardor, and
with the fame spirit which had animated him
to refill the efforts of one nation to reduce us
to an odious vassalage, he pledged himfclf to his*
j fellow citizens to refill every other, which
might repeat the daring attempt. When the
national legiilature (hall have reciprocated these
American sentiments, as there can be no doubt
they will, then (hall we fee an end to the expir
ing and contemptible efforts of domestic and
foreign fa&ionstotrample on our independence.
Then {ball we fee an end to the degrading com
plaints of a Monro?, and the inlulting speech
of a Barr as, then (hall we rally as otc fami
ly, united, free, and happy, around our oiun
government, and the enlightened adminiftra.
tion of a long tried patriot, who has devoted
his iifc toferve his country and maintain its

New-Hamplhire, did the fame yefterdiy.
The speaker ofefcrved, that there wu a rule
of the House in these wotiU : " No committee
liiall fit during the fitting of the House, without
special leave."âHe thought il neceffaryto ob
fcrve, that he had sent to the committee to
whom it was referred to prepare an answer to
the P=efident's fpcech, to learn if they were
ready to report. They relumed for answer,
that provided they had leave to Gt, they (houtd
be able to report the answer in half an hour.

Secretary of* State, dated Paris, Dec. 10, 17*6,
giving an account of his arrival at Bourdeaux ;
of his jobrVjey from thence to Paris, in which,
from the badriefs of the roads, he broke three j
wheels of his carnage ; of the ill treatment he 1
received from M. Delacroix, &c. He remarks
that it is Â»ot furprHing that the French Repub
lic have refufed to receive him, since they have
dismissed no less than thirteen Foreign Miniliers;
and fine* they have been led to believe by a late
Emigrant, that the United States was of no
greater confeauence to them than the Republics
of Genoa or Geneva. He also mentions, that
it Itemed to be the opinion in France that much
depended upon the election of the President, as
eoeof the candidates was con Cd-red as a friend
â¢f England, and the other as devoted to Franc*.
The people of France, he observes, have been
greatly deceived, with refpefl to the United
States, by mifrepreftrnations, being led to be
lieve, that the People and Government have dif
ferent views ; but, adds he, any attempt to di
vide the People from the Government, ought to
be to the People of the United States, the Jignal
far rallying âGenEinckntyfeveral times men
tions Mr. Monroe in this letter with great ref
peft ; and fays that before bis arrival the Di

Hws : but refufed to commit his orders to

roe's address, as Â» curious production ; but

had it prepared, and was unacquainted with
what would be said by Mr Monroe.

Dutch hadohje&ed to do this, a Hedging lhat it
would be a great injury to them, astheyfhould

resident in Philadelphia, to the Secretary of
State, dated May 6, 1 complaining of
the injurious operation of the Britilh Treaty
against Spain, in three refpeflt, viz. as it
destroys the do&rine of free ships making
free goods ; as it makes certain articles con
traband of was, which in former, ireatiet
were not considered lo ; and as it givet to
Great Britain a. right to navigate the Milfi
fippi, which that minister infills belonged not
to us "to give, as it belonged wholly to Spain
before it gave the right tethe United States,
by the late treaty,Â® to navigate that river.âÂ».
He concludes his letter with faying, that
the King of Spain is desirous of harmorfy
between the two countries, and relies upon
the equality of his complaints for fatisfae
tion.
17. A letter from the Secretary of State to
the Spanish minister, in answer to the above ; in
which he acknowledges that the treaty lately
concluded b, tween the two countries, had prov
ed'fatisfa<Sory to the United States, as it put an
end to a dispute wh'ch had exiited for many
years refpeifling the navigation of the Milfilippi,
and also as it afforded fatisfaSion to our mer
cantile citizens for the capture-os our ffiips and
cargoes All these, he allowed, were a<sls of
fubffabtial justice ; but all the ctker ftipulatiotis
were wholly voluntary, and perfetSly reciprocal.-
With refpeft to the three articles of complaint
refpeAing the Britilh treaty, he juftified the Ih
pulations as being just and consistent, and such
as this country had a right to enter into.
18. A letter from general Pin kney to the Se
cretary of State, dated Paris, February j, Hat
ing that the day after the arrival of the news of
the French general Buonaparte's fuceeffes in Ita
ly, he received a letter from M. Delacroix, di
re&ing him to Ipave Paris. Gen. Pinekney con
dudes this letter with observing, that the French
seemed to speak of this country as if it were
indebted to them for Independence, and not to
any exertions of our own. Our treaty with
Great-Britain is execrated : they with us tahave
no connexion with that country ; they wish to
to destroy the trade of Oreat-Britain, and they
look upon us as her best cuftorner.
The whole of these documents having been
read, on motion, they were committed to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the U
nion, and 500 copies ordered to be printed.
Mr. Venable, from the Committee appointed
to prepare an aqfwer to the Speech of the Presi
dent, reported one (pretty much an echo of the
Speech) which was twice read and.committed to
a committee of the whole.
On the Speaker esquiring for whÂ»t day it
fliould be mader, Mr. W. Smith mentioned to
morrowâMr. Nicholas Monday.,
Mr. Giles said the Answer could not be print
ed before to-morrow. As it was, perhaps, the
most important answer which ever was returned
to a speech finee thncommencemeni. *f the pre
sent government, and therefore ougqt to be well
considered, he thought Monday as early as it
ought to be taken up.
Mr. Livingfton said there was another reason
for delay. In the reading of the Answer, it
appeared to him to go to an approbation of alt
the measures of the executive in /elation to fo
reign nations. If so, it was of the utmost
eonftquence that the papers which had just been
read, Ihould also he laid before rhem previous to
its difeuffion, as they < ould not form an opinion
on that fubjedl until they had au opportunity of
perufisg these papers.
The question was carried for Monday.
Mr. New presented the-petition of Robert
Rutherford, complaining of the undue ele&ioii
of gen. Morgan (for the diftrifl which he for
merly represented) and praying for redrefc in
the prcmifes Referred to the Committee of
Eleflions.
Mr- W, Smith moved, that as the eonfidera
tion of the anfwtr to .he P efidtnf'sSpeech was
made the order for Mouday, that when the
House adjourued, it naight adjourn to that elay.

The Audiian army in Italy has now taken

During the lad three days, public prayers

THE MOP.N.tN.O CHRONICLE.
. LONDON, April. I.
We lament to fay, that according to the
reports in the-beft informed political circles,
the accounts which ministers received from
tbe-contineot on Thurfdav, by no means an
nounce the profpeft of peace to any of the
belligerent powers. The league of the Pro
tcftant princes of Germany begins now to
manifefl and intentions. The army
of the king of Pruflia is atSlually in motion,
and his deligns are no longer equivocal. He
threaten! to fall upop Bohemia, while Buona
parte penetrates by the Tyrol, and Hoche
by the Lower Rhmc. This formidable at
tack, in the exhausted Hate of the house of
Austria, threaten! the very exigence of the
emperor, and there is no doubt but he mull
finally yield to their unprincipled demands.
By this league, and mi the event of the
feculat Ration of the-bifltopricks, the emperor
will have the inadequate compensation of
Saltzburg ; the king of PruÃia will fcize on
the rich bifhoprick of Munfter, end the elefl
or of Hanover, upon Ofnaburgh. The flad
tholder will have the bifhoprick of Fulda, and
each of the contrading partiei will have the
slice most convenient to hi! present eftatei.

The Hamburgh mail which arrived on Sa
turday brings dill furrhec.confitmation of the
important fad*, that the emperor of Germa
ny, with a eondancy that doei honor to his
courage, though it will be probably unavail
ing, mutters all his Ifrength to stem the tor
rent just ready to brealc in upon hisiiereditary
doÃimi.onsj and to force him to the surrender
of his preponderance in the Germanic body.
He is perfectly aware g{ the tende'ney of the
league which is formetTfor t<K aggrandize '
nient of the house of Erlhdenburgh. In the
February last Ist prefentcd a rescript
to the diet of the empire, in which we find
the rolluwing remarkable passage:
His majesty has repeatedly apprized the
dates of the empire, aftd particularly iheec
Llefiallica! dates, of their danger. ' He has '
endeavoied to convince them, that their event,

to compel the empire of Germany, divided

fay that his answer is equivocal, in co'nfe
qucoce of which a favorable interpretation
has been given to it. Our reader! shall judge
for themfclves. The following article is from
Hamburgh. It will appear that out miniders
are more zealous in the cause. They have
not only agreed tojrive the house of Austria
fucconr in thoney dire 6t t but they have.held
out most tempting offer! to RuHia of a large
subsidy tq engage that court to inttrfere.â
The article from Hamburgh is as follows :
HAMBURGH, March 22.
Out accounts are, that the emperor Paul
has given an unfavorable answer Â«o the court
of London relative to hisfupport of the tri

doubtful terms To the eourt of Vienna

induce him to become a meditator bet ween
Austria and France; and that he fhonld de

should receive frotji his PruÃjin rtpjefly,â
This, i: ii observed, is laying the pride of
Austria at the feet of itÂ» rival with a wit
nefa.
The mail brings no other newi. The ar
mies are generally in motion, and all appear
ances indicate a most obstinate campaign ;
in which, through councils te
which wc are condemned, thii country is to
be deeply involved.
It it only by the declaratiwn of the united
fenfeof the country that we can deliver our
felvcs from this dreadful calamity. London
has given a grand and laudable example. The
common h'alf have solemnly ennfirmrd their
firft resolution ; and w* have seen that the
body of contractor! and jobbers, who thrive
upon the public spoil, have not-dared, as
heretofore, to agitate the question of a coun

On Saturday tbe Lord Mayor, Aldermen
and Livery of the City of Lotidon, afiembled
in Common Hall, to consider the report of
his Majesty's answer as to the time of receiv

The Hall being opend with the usual
formalities, the lord mayor informed the
meeting that the report of the Sheriffs would
be read by the Common Sergeant.
Mr. Sylvester (the Common Sergeant)
read the report. It ftatird that the Sheriffs
had attended at St. James's on Friday, the
24th of March, to knowlwben the addrefa,

address of*the Livery in the common form at
the Levee on the Wedriefday following, or
upon any utber. Levee Hay.-
Mr. Hvmfon adorcfTed the Livery. After
a speech of confidetablc length, in which he
vefy forcibly dated the insults which his
roajefty'ijminifters had,in this inllance, given
to the Citizens of London, He movedââ¢>
That the Sheriffs of. London have.at
all'times a right to an audience of the King,
arid when deputed b.y 'tfie Lj,very of London,
they are in duty bound to demand it."
Mr. Farmer the motion. He
said he had more refpeft for his msjeny than

those which followed.- "On the shew of hands

he was forty to observe, was not preferit orf,
that dajs. He thought the fheriSfs had. ,
very impfopetiy in taking an answer from
ilie-dukeof Portland, and returning without
ta agdiepce of the king. Thu duke of Port
land afled, t in this inftauce, only as a fervent,
and it did not become the citizens of Lon

After this tefolutiori wii passed, Mr. She
