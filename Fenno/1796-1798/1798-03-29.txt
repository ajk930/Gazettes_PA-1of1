STATE OF THE UNION.
Tuesday, March 27.
The Houle having rcfolved iÂ»l'elf into a com
mittee ofthe whole on the date of the Uni
bn, Mr. Dent m the chaft, and the fol
lowing resolution being under conliderati
on, v:z.
" Rcfolved, That it iÂ« the opinion of this com
mittee, that, under rxifting circumstances, it it not
expedient for the United States to resort to war a
jainft the French republic."
Mr. Harper luppofed there would be an
unanimous vote on this resolution. He never
heard afentiment contrary to it. He was wil
ling to declare that it was not at present ex
pedient to go to war with any nation.
M'. Sitcr*avit said that, tor himlelf, he could
not agree to the propol. d rcfolwion * H- did r.ot

war ben g, bv the c ntluuuon, veiled in the COl.-
gref\ ; so ong as t'.e Congrefs'hall I rbea- to declare
war, it u an efficient exprcfUon of their fentimeni
that luch adechration would be imx; edieoiâlt is
the only proper expreffionof tuch a sentiment; and
itemino more be right to relolve tha we wi I no'.
rclori 10 war, than it would be to pafa an ait decla
ring that wc will not make a law tor the regulation of
barktuplcv or any othtr municipal corcern. How
ever dtlirab e theref re he admitted uiianimny to be
at a lime like the present, he found it impofuble to
ague to Ihe refo'.utiun,
Mr. B a Li) win did not agree with the gen
tleman lali ud j he thought the resolution
proper and free from exception. We werfe,
he f;iid, 23 years ago, when we were about
beginning the war with Great Britain, in a
fim.lar !:.uatioa to rhe present ; but we were
then without many advantages which we now
have. We were then without any common
' tie, except what arose from common interelt.
No means exilletl of holding conference toge
ther ; but nature pointed out courle to
be taken, and representatives' from different
parts of the country wersT'tiavelliiig at the
fame moment, to hold council together as to
what was proper to be done. He believed, in
the present trying situation, it was proper for
them to hold council together, and to (peak,
the.r lentiments. The gentleman jull fat
down apprehends war mult be the conle
quenie ot our present fituution.
Mr. B. fa d, this was the lirft time that the
qwefilon of declaring war had ever presented
itfelf, and upon which, he believed, there
might be a difference of opinion as to the ex
ercile of that power. He did not mean to fay
wautonry that our constitution is imperfeAâ
but every society which has a written consti
tution, r.uift haverecourfe tait for direction.
It would be proper therefore to eryjuire what
agency the legislature ought to have in the
declaring tÂ»i war; whether it is not preper
that all the circumstances relative to such a
state should be before them. He did not be
lieve it was intended that this House Ihouid
merely be the inflrument to give the found of
war; the JTttbjeci seemed to be put wholly in
to the hands ofthe legislature. This was the
uiiderftaiiding of the country, w hen there was
no government in existence, and he believed
this was the meaning of the constitution. The
coun'ry is now gtery where agitating this
question of peace or war ; and he traded they
would not be left to grope their way in the
dark on this important q.ieltion Ihe Presi
dent lia 1 informed the House that all hopes of
neguciationare' at an end. He was willing to
take the information as given, without going
i'nto the cabinet of the Executive, and to take
measures accordingly. But when some per
sons declare that the prelent state of things is
already a liate of war ; that the country is go
ing on in it; that th: die is call, and that we
have nothing to do but go on with it as well
as we can, if the House does not believe this
to be a true position, this resolution ought to
be agreed to, which went to fay that the House
does not consider the present a state of war,
but a state of peace. 1
Mr. Otis said, if the gentleman who made
the motion' would consent to use the conftitu
tional words on this occasion, he apprehended
there would be 110 dilt'erence of opinion : he
meant that infiead of faying " to resort to
war," to fay to declare war.
Mr. Sprigc (aid, the resolution which he
had rropoled had not been the work of a mo
ment, and he did not feel disposed to make
the alteration proposed.
Mr. Otis added, then he should move to
flrike out the words " resort to," and insert
declare, as he was of opin.on with the gentle
man froili Pennsylvania (Mr. Sitgreaves) that
the only fubjeds fit for dilcuflion wereattive
measures, and that it was not regular tg de
â¢clare when they would not do a thing.
Mr. PmcxNEir was desirous of fettling this
motion by the previous queftionj but he was
informed by the chairthat such a motion would
not be in order in a committee of the whole
Mr. Davton (the Speaker) said that he
hoped his friend would
withdraw the motion Ire had just ottered, 111
order to make room for one lie had to offer,
Vhich would render the firft resolution more
general, more innocent, and yet equally or
more efficacious, and would ted the sincerity
of the advocates of that resolution, as to their
profelfed anxiety fortlie maintenance of peace.
Upon Mr. Otis's withdrawing his motion,
Mr. Dayton moved to strike out the words
" against the French Republic," and declared
thai although he deemed the whole resoluti
on unnecellary, and conlidered it as not natu
rally growing'out of the Prelident's message,
which did not call upon us to declare or make
war, yet as it must be the intention of the
mover, or of fame other member, to follow
it up with like declarations in favour of all
other nations Vvith whom the United States
had any intercourse, provided they ailed con
fidently, he thought it better to make the re
solution a general one, even if Itfho.uld after
wards be negatived. He, forhiinfelf, was as
ready to fay that, under ending ctrcumftan-
was not expedient forthe United State*
to go to war with any other nation, as with
the Trench Republic. He saw no gjod rea
son why that particular power should b* An
gled out in the manner proposed ; and as he
was for cultivating peace not with one only,
but.with all the nations of the world, he was
wilbng so to declare his difpotition, if any de
claration was proper on the occasion. It was
also to be observed, that it could not with
propriety be objected against the amendment,
that there was no other nation with whom we
were in danger of entering into hostility, for
the tables of the Hoafe had betn loaded with
communications relative to the encroachments
and unieafonahle demands of another country,
which had occasioned an apprehension that
the United States would be driven to the ne
cejjity of a war, in order to obtain pdffeflion
of its own territofy. If, therefore, gentle
men were anxious to cultivate harmony with
the French only, then the resolution, as firft
moved, was proper for their adoption; but
if the preservation of peace with all wastheir
real objefi, then he truded that the amend
ment could not with propriety be rejected by
those very geritlemen w ho had introduced and
advocated a proposition, the utility of which,
under any modification, he owned for himfelf,
he could not difccrn, although he was willing
to render it as unexceptionable as pbflible be
fore it was decided upon.
Mr. Spring informed the gentleman from
New-Jersey, that the reafonwhythe French
Republic was inserted in the resolution was
because it was founded on the mefTage of the
President, which related solely to the French
Republic. For his part, he was not delifouS
of war with any power on earth.
Mr. Harper fetonded the motion of the
gentleman from New-Jersey, because he tho't
it would be better in that (nape. He had no
particular objeftion to the resolution as pro
posed, only that he thought it a resolution a
bout nothing; but as it rr|ight gratify the
mover and some others, he should not object
to it. He wis himfelf not disposed for war,
but for peace, wh.lft peace could be preserv
ed. But he never said, and would not fay;
that war was the word thing which could hap
pen so this country ; he thought fubmilfion
to the aggreflions of a foreign power infinitely
worse. If gentlemen meant, by agreeing to
this resolution, to prevent the country from
being put into a state of defence ; ifthey meant
by it to effect an entering wJdge to fubmifli
on, he trusted they wouid find themselves
juiftakenâfor though he believed the true
imereft of the country lay in peace, yet he was
not disposed to recede from any measures
which he thought proper, for fear of war. Or
did gentlemen intend, by this question of
peace or war, to enlist the popular prejudices
ift favour of peace, in order to prevent proper
measures being taken for the defence of the
country! If this was their view, he should
be the firft to (trip off thedifguife. He trust
ed this was not the cafe, ds he saw it connect
ed with another resolution, which proposed
the taking of measures for the defence of the
country. The question at prelent, said Mr.
H. is not a question of war, but of defenceâ
and no two qiteftions are more distinct. If
gentlemen confound these two questions, and
'are determined to take no meaftiresof defence
left they fliould lead to war, let thein fay so.
He believed, however, the distinction was well
underltood by the American People.
Mr. Giles believed this the proper time
to declare whether the country should remain
in Peace or go to War. He thought the re
solution proper as it ftood_ because founded
on thÂ» melTage of the President, in which the
French Republic is only named. There was
a part of that message, he said, which in his
opinion, ainounied to a declaration of~war.
The President tells the Houle, " that the si
tuation of things is materially changed since
he ifTued his order te prevent the ahning of
merchant vessels." As far as he underltood
rhe situation of the United States at that time,
it was a state of neutrality., if that date is
changed, and the present is not a date of neu
trality, he wilhed to know what it is ? He
knew only of t*o dates,-a date' of neutrali
ty and a date of war; he knew of no
mongrel date between them. Therefore,
if the President of the United States could
declare war, are now in war. Bel eving,
however, that Congress had alone the
power to declare war, he thought it time
10 declare what (he Hate of the nation is. He
did not know whether the object might not
be answered by the resolution being general,
as he was, and aKvays had been (notwithdand
ing infinnutions to the contrary) againd war
with any nation upon earth. He looked uu
/m it as the greated calamity which could be
lal any nation ; and whatever may be the
phantoms raised in perspective, of national
honour and glory in such a Itate, they will, in
the end, all prove fallacious. He believed no
nation ought to go to war, except when at
tacked ; and this kind of war, he should be
as ready to meet as any one. Mr. G. said
gentlemen were continually speaking of the
degraded state ofthe nation, when their oyn
measures had led to it. [Mr. Harper deni
ed that he had everfaid the nation was in a
degraded date.] Mr. G. was not sure that
he had said it, but he believed he had fre
quently heard it. He believed we were in a
date which required the utmost vigour ; but
lie thought every measure should be avoided
which might involvte the country in war. For
if we were to go to war with the French at
urefent, he knew not what event could take
place which could produce peace ; it mud be
a war of extermination. Mr. G. did not
know that the present question was very im
portant ; but believing it dnctlyconformable
â  o the message of the President, he Ihouid be*
11 favour of it as it (tood, and against the a
ineudment.
Mr. Nicholas considered this amendment
is defeating the resolution. Was there no
hing, he alked, which called for a declarati
on of the kind proposed f Was it not clear to
every one that the country was going faft into
a date of war, and (in the words of Mr. Sit
greaves) was it not to be expected f Ought
not the legidature, then, (who have only the
power of declaring war) to determine the date
of the country, and fay whether they mean to :
go immediately to war, or not f He thought i
he necedity ot the resolution was fufficiently i
evident, by the motion which had been made
to change the words trom "refoit to war,"
ro declare 'war ; if the one cafe the mifchiet
was met, whild the other meant nothing. And
if gentlemen were ready to fay we were not i
prepared to declare 'war, and at the fame time
were not ready to fay it is not expedient to re
fart to 'war, it proved that they thought war
might be made without being declared. He
alked whether gentlemen did not believe the
Executive had taken measures which would
lead to war f And that it he were at liberty to
aft upon a change of circumstances between
this country and others, Congress were not
brought into a situation in which they had no
choice ? Many difcuflions had heretofore tak
en place on the constitution, but he had ne
ver yet heard it doubted that Congress had
the )iower over the progress of what led to
war, as well as the power of declaring v\ar ;
but if the President could take the measures
which he had taken with refpeit to the arm
ing of merchant vessels, lie and not Congress
had the power of making war. Heafked whe
ther, when report went so far as to speak ofan
alliance offenfive and defenfive with a foreign
country, it was not time to come to a declara
tion on the fubjett ? Suppose such an alli
ance was formed, would it not be said that
Congress are bound to carry it into effect f He
knew it would, though he fhbuld refill the
doÂ£lrine. Mr. Nicholas he should be
as unwilling to submit to any foreign coun
try as the gentleman from S. Carolina ; but
he could not, like that gentleman, fay "he was
not afraid of ivar. I am, faici he, afraid of it.
This country affords me all the happiness I
can with or hope for, and I know war v*iU be
j destruction to it. What was the difference
â¢ betwixt liimfelf and that gentleman, in this
j respect, he could not tell j it was to him fur-
I priling that any gentleman should be without
| tear as to the mifchiefÂ» of war. He was of
opinion that the step taken by the President
with respect to merchant vessels went to de
clare, that we relted ourcaufe on arms,which
was not calculated to produce any good effect
in our favour. He hoped the amendment
would not be agreed to ; if it was, he should
vote against the resolution itfelf : and he did
not think the gentleman from New-Jersey,
when he read the message of the Rrelident,
could think there was as much danger of a
war with any other country as with the French
Republic. 1 ' S
Mr. Brooks agreed with the gerttleman
who brought forward this resolution, so far as
it declares we ar<- not prepared to resort to
war. He believed no nation or man, who had
common understanding, could be fond of war.
The people of this Country have yet the re
collection of the fatal effects of the late war.
, But there are two kinds of war, offentive and
defenfive. He wilhed gentlemen to distinguish
betwixt them ; for tho' he was ready to de
clare against offenlive war, and to submit to
small injuries father than make defenfive war,
yet lie vvas not willing to fay he Ihould not be
ready to defend his country against the attack
;of any foreign power whatever. He hopedJi#
f ihould be believed in this'declaration, as he
had formerly been employed in the defence of
| it ; and if gentlemen meant that tho' foreign
; nations attempt to invade our territory, and
to reduce us again to the colonies of a foreign
power, (hey would not repel them, he could
not join them in opinion. And though he
should vote for the resolution as moved to be
amended, he should feel himfclf at perfect li
-1 berty to defend his country in cafe of attack.
He wondered the gentleman from Virginia
should objeCt to vote for the refolutior, be
cause it was general, as it included the French
Republic as wefl as all other nations.
Mr. Uui l.dgk hoped the principle upon
which the gentleman from New-York afted,
would govern the committse, and that its lan
guage and condufl on the present occalion,
would convince the world, that-although peace
is mofl ardently desired by America, yet that
she is ready and determined to defend her rights
ayainit the atticks of any so eign power what
ever. He trufled ttiat congrefs and
the opinions of the in this eriti
c'al juncture be prrfeflly in unison and shew that
alth ugh our citizens value thebleflings o{peace
as highly a? any people can prize them, yet they
are r adv to abandon them if the preservation
of their libert es and independence shall require
it, and that they will refill insult and injury
trom whatever quarter they may come. He be
lieved no leg flative aflembly was ever called
upon to make fa unneceflary a declaration as the
one under consideration. When there l wjs no
propofitiwn for going to war, when no member
talked of declaring war, and when, as he he-
I eved, no one thought of foing to war with the
French republic ; why the committee fh.iuld
make a declaration of peace, he could not un-
I derfland : but useless an 1 novel as this resolution
| Â«as, he should vote for it as amended by the
; honorable member from Jtrfey, because there
| were certain members of the committed who
were daily declaring trat other members were
forgoing to war, and if he did not now rote
f r a declaration of peace, these charitable gen
tlemen might imply that he was willing for war.
Ir. these days of j aloufy and ful'picion, it was
oeceflary for public men to weigh their words
and anions with as much riisety as poison which
was intended not to have fatal effects, and this
being the cafe, if he was to vote against the
present unmeaning resolution, he might be f id
he was for war. To a gentl.-man from Virgin
ia, who is conlantly founding this chirge (Mr.
Giles) he took this occasion of faying, that his
declarationjsit rehtt-d to himfelf, was not true.
Gentlemen alked whether war is not ap
proaching t And whether the Executive is
not hastening it ? ToT'the -latter question, he
would anfwerin the negative ; with respect td
the other, he could not answer, as it depended
upori'France, and so versatile and uncertain is
every thing in that country, that no depen
dance can be had upon it. Mr. R. said, at
the last feflion, when we had no intercourse
with France, he thought it necefTary we should
have it ; that intercourse had proved ineffec
tual ; and though hefincerely wiftied for peace,
yet he saw something in the conduct of France
which almost precluded the hope.
The gentleman from Virginia had said, that
this country had frequently been stated as in a
degraded date. He did not recollect to have
made the declaration ; but this was his opini
on. When our national rights had been vio
lated ; when our commerce had been depre
dated ; when vessels of belligerent powers
which had fought anafylumin our waters,
had been plundered and burnt, he thought it
neceftary to go into measures of defence. He
thought our frigates ought not to have re
mained at the wharves; that our e*ten(ive
sea-coast, on which is much wealth, should
not be unprotected ; he thought our sea-ports,
the principal depots of our revenue, ought
to have been fortified. He joined his friends
in their attempts to have carried these mea
sures, and when they failed, he could not
help thinking his country was in a degraded
state, and that she had loft the spirit which
animated her in yetir 1775. He hoped,
however, that now, when France had gone
to the leagths which she has gone to, that
there would have been onlyone f'entimentas to
the propriety of the measures formerly propo
i fed. But though he thought the Nation in a
â¢ degraded state, he was not 111 favour of war.
I He believed the citizens of thfs country were
1 not for it. He believed the Government was
1 averse to war ; and that no part of it was more
so than the Executive. War would be loss
to this Country ; and to no individual more
than the Executive. He is no warrior, and
consequently War has no laurels in flore for
him.
The gentleman from-Virginia had spoken
of War as having something dazzling in per
spective ; something which flattered, pride
and ambition. But (fid the gentleman sup
pose that a war with France could be flatter
ing to pride or ambition f It could not ; it
would be a war of pruaence; we mutt shut
otirfelves up, and ad oh the defenfive, and
fay, " When reason returns ; when an ebb
shall take place in the affairs of France ; when
her flow of victories shall be over, she will do
us justice." In the mean time, we mull de
fend ourselves. Mr. R. repeated that he did
not believe any man in .that houfc could.wish
for war ; when he looked round him, and
saw gentlemen whose wounds are yet fore from
former service ; when he saw them voting for
measures of defence, he could not believe,
nor could any believe that they wiftied to
plunge {he country in war. It would sooner
be believed that gentlemen who made the
charges we e mistaken.
Mr. Sewall was opposed to the proposi
tion as it now Itood, and hoped it would be
amended. What effect it would then have,
he left those to judge who introduced it. Mr.
$. {aid, he, and thafc who on all que.lionS of
defertte had voted with him, had been en
deavouring for fomc time to go into some
measures of that kind ; and to determine whe
ther these measures fkould be confined to our
own limits, or be extended to the ocean.
These measures ought now to be decided up
on, as this is a moment in which our com
merce is depredated upon in a mod unprece
dented manner. We are now, said he, call
ed upon to hazards of ourfititati
-011, [Mr. S, then quoted a parr of the Presi
dent's melfage as to the filiation of our allairs
in France, and as to the decree which was
prppofed respecting the taking of English
goods 011 board of neutral velfels, and the
carrying of which was declared to make neu
tral velfels good prizes.] This last regulati
on, Mr, S. said, was a direst violation of the
law of nations, and amounted to a declarati
on of war on the part of Fiance againlt this
country. But, inllead of making any defence,
gentlemen call upon the committee to declare
weare not disposed torefort to war against the
French Republic ; so that after we have been
injured and abused, and denied the common
rights of humanity, we are not to complain,
but make a declaration that we will not go to
war- Was then, a question of war, he alk
ed, a Card of Politeriefs ? Did a nation ever
make a declaration that it was not at war ? It
could not fay so, except it were in so degfa
ded a state that it had no rights capable of in
jury. To fay we are not at war, was to fay
110 more than it is light when the fun (hines ;
but to call upon the committee to fay so at
this time, was to degrade the nation from its
independence, and below its character. The
present state of things, Mr. S. said, ought to
beconlidered as a flute of war,not declaredb y
us, but against us, by the French Republic ;
audit, said he, we want spirit to defend our
selves, let us not fay so ; we may refrain from
aCting,but let us not fay we receive injuries with
thankfulnefs. But this proportion goes (till
further. In a moment ot public danger, it
goes to divide and separate this house from
the Prelident of the United States. The gen
tleman from Virginia had well explained this
resolution, when he said it was intended to
interrupt the views of the President ot the U
nited States. That gentlemanconfidered the
meflage of the President as a declaration of
war, and this resolution was to be in contra
diction to it. If this was the sense in which
it was to be tinderftood, it was falfe in point
of fact ; for the President had neither decla
red War, nor called upon Congress to de
clare War ; 110 such sentiment could be found
in the meflage. To agree to the proportion
as it (lands, would be to give countenance to
the aftertion of the French government that
we are a' people divided from otif govern
ment ; but taking it with the amendment, he
looked upon it as a harmlcfs thing. Mr. S.
concluded by faying, that he considered the
conduit of France in the light of War. How
far we would resent it, was the question,
whether offenfively or defenfively. He was
in favour of defenfive measures, as we are not
equal to offenfive measures (he wiftied to God
we were). It was our weakness, and the di
vision which had appeared in our councils,
that had invited these attacks. He
they should and repel them.
Mr. Gallatin said, before the speech of
the gentleman just fat down, he could not dis
cover w hat was the meaning of the amend
ment to lirike out the words against the French
Republic, as when the house were in a com
mittee of the whole on the State of the Union,
tor considering the late meflage ot the Presi
dent, the resolution was perfectly consonant.
Bdf'des, we have no danger to apprehend
from any other power, since our dispute is
fettled with Spain. The intention of the a
mendment was evidently to render the reso
lution as unmeaning as pollible.
Every gentleman who had spoke on this
subjeCt had agreed that war is not a desirable
objeCt for the United States. He gave them
credit for the aftertion. But this was not the
question ; but whether we are prepared to re
sort to war under exilting circumstances, It is
a question ot fact. Mr. G. took notice of the
different modes which had been attempted to
defeat the resolution ; but he said, though the
present amendment were agreed to, he should
(till vote in favour of the resolution ; for it
would be effectual in some degree, as.it could
only apply to the French nation,though it was
not so exprelfed.
Mr. G. believed the United States were
arrived at a crisis at which a stand ought to be
made ; in which it was neceftary tor Congress
to fay whether they will resort to war, or pre
serve peace. He was led to this conclusion
from a review of the conduit of France, and
of the late meflage of the Prelident.
In respect to France, we know, that some
time ago, she declared our treaty- with her to
t: at an end ; though not in words, therefult
was to deprive us of the .advantages derived
from that treaty. In the next place, the dif
milfed our minister plenipotentiary. Under
thefie circumstances, the Prelident called the
extraordinary feflion of Congress, and when
met together, after having related the reasons
which induced this call,heconcluded with fay
ing, " that it was his sincere desire to preserve
peace and friendfhip with all nations, and be
lieving that neither the honour nor the interest
of the United States absolutely forbade the
repetition of advances for securing these de
sirable objects, he Ihould not,fail to promote
and accelerate an accommodation, See." The
President accordingly sent envoys to France,
and the result of the embassy was given to
Congress in the last meflage, which was now
under consideration, in which he fays, " the
object of the million cannot be accommodated
on terms compatible with the fafety, honour,
or the essential interelts of the nation." The
people of the United States are therefore in
formed, that negociations are at an end, and
that we cannot obtain redress for wrongs, but
may expeCt a continuation of captures incon
sequence of the decree which it was supposed
was part, for seizing all neutral vessels with
British property, manufactures or produce on
board. Mr. G, said he differed in opinion
from the gentleman last up, that this was a de
claration of war. He allowed it would be
jufhfiable ground of war for this country, and
that, on this account, it was neceftary to agree
to, orreject the present proposition, in order
to determine the ground intended to be taken.
For though there may be juftifiable cause for
war, if it is not our interest to go to war,the re
solution will be agreed tp.
There was another reason why this resolu
tion ought to be now decided, which arose
from the conduct of our Executive. He has
declared that a change of circumstances has
taken place which has occasioned him to with
draw his order forbidding merchant vessels to
arm, which amounts so this, that he now per
mits vessels of the United States to life , means
ofdefence against any attack which may be
made upon them. Mr. G. thought it neces
sary, therefore, to declare, whether we were
to pursue measures of war or peace. Before
measures are taken which will lead to war,
the house ought to decide whether it is their
inteation at present to go to war.
Ilie genueman from New-York had spo
ken of the difference betwixt offenfive and
I defenfive war. This related to the motives,
mare than to the manner,of cus -; â  on war ,
because when war is once entered ..' o, though
it may be at firft defenfive, it can.:>"t remain
so. It would be ridiculous, for instance, tÂ®
fay, that our frigates (liould prevent outvef
fels froth being taken j but that they ftibuld
not take French privateers. ,
But it was fail), if the relolution was agreed
to, it would confirm the opinion which had
been held that Congress and the' Executive
were divided in opinion. The gentleman
from Mallachufetts (Mr. Sewall) told the
house that the question was War or
that the conduct of France was'a declaration
of war, yet, as the President had not called
upon Congress to go to war, they ought not
to declare it is not expedient torefort to war.
But if it be alfiiined as a principle, which that
gentleman alTerts, that ihe condurt of the
French is a declaration of war, and the Presi
dent has told us we are in war, the resolution
could not be improper. Or if his other prin
ciple be alfumed, that the information of the
President does not amount to war, then an a
greement to the resolution would (hew that
Congress concurred with him in opinion, that
ir is not proper at present to resort to war. SÂ»
that in both cases, the resolution is proper.
Mr. G. said he was precluded by the a
mendment from going into the merits of the
resolution. His arguments went to (hew the
propriety of agreeing to it'\n oije way or o
ther. Nor did he mean to take any notice of
what had been said about a division of opi
nion in our councils having invited the insults
and injuries which France had committed a
gainst this counts)'. If he were to do this,
lie mult have recourse to recrimination, which
he did not vvilh. He wilhed rather to take a
serious view of our present iituation, andjeither
meet it by war, or by measures which (hall
avoid war. On both fides are difficulties ;
but thedifficultiesand rnconveniencies ofboth
ought to be weighed, and the least taken, and
having determined, measures ought tobepur
fued accordingly. He did not wifli to adopt
the raiblution as proposed to be amended, and
then go on and att directly contrary to it. He
thought it belt to meet the resolution at once,
and fay whether we are determined on war or
peace. If we go to war, we mud expert to
meet all the ex pence and evils of such a (late ;
and if we remain at peace, we mult, in a cer
tain degree,fubmit. He meant to fay, that
we must submit to have a number of our ves
sels taken. But whether we (hall have more
taken in adopting one course than the other,
he left gentlemen to determine. He thought
the fubmirtion he had mentioned, very diffe
rent from the fubmifiion which had been fno
ken by the gentleman from South-Carolina
and others.
Mr. G. concluded, by observing, that the
condurt of France must tend to deftrov that
influence which gentlemen had so often com
plained of,as existing in this country. Indeed,
he was convinced that at the commencement
of her revolution there was a grÂ»at enthufiafni
amongst our citizens in favour of her cause,
which naturally arose from their having been
engaged in a similar contest ; but he believed
these feelings had been greatly diuiini(hed by
her late condurt towards this country. He
thought, therefore, that whether we engaged
jn war, or remained in a (late of peace, much
need not be apprehended from the influence
of France on our councils. The business was
come to a mere matter of calculation, as to
what course will be belt to betaken for the
intereftand happiness of the country. If he
could separate defenfive from oftenfive war art
(ea, he should be in favour of it ; but hecould
not make the diftinrtion, and therefore he
(hould be in favour of pursuing measures of*
peace.
Several persons rose, but being about three
o'clock a motion was made for the committee
to rife, which was negatived 46 to 44.
Mr. Dana did not conceive that thecon
ftrurtion of language given by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, was to be taken as true,
without examination. He trusted not. The
gentleman stated the question to be Peace or
War ; he could not conceive it to be such.
It was unfortunate that, in this important
crilis, the house (hould be engaged, like a set
of Rhetoricians, indifputing the meaning of
words. Indeed, the decision 011 tl]e pi-efen
motiort, he thought wholly unimportant.
I lie gentleman last up had said there was
no diftinrtion betwixt offenfive and defenfive
war, and that he was, therefore, opposed to
either. Mr. D. thought the diftinition clear
offenfive war, is when an attack is made up-
to war, merely for felf defence ; but
there was another date of things which could
not have the name of war, which was to have
recoufre to measures of defence ; to be pre
pared in cases of attack. Itwasclear, by thÂ«
law of nations, that to prepare for defence,
was not to commit hostility. To fay that to
take measures of defence, is hostility, was a
new definition, and it was the mighty disco
very of the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
Did gentlemen mean that if wefhould make
use of force against iawlefs violence, it is
war f If not, what did all that had been said
amount to ? He thought the proposition per
fectly nugatory.
But the gentleman said, that his friend from
Maflachufrtts, had said, that France had al
ready declared war against 11s, and that, there
fore, we must resort to war. For his part, he
did not know what gentlemen meant by resort
ing to -war ; if they had adopted terms' which
had any legal meaning, he could have under
stood them j but the present might mean eve
ry thing or nothing. If it meant any thing,
it meant taking artive measures against Prance
in the firft instance. He was not onlv ready
to fay he would not consent to do this with
refpert to France, but with refped to every
other nation.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania, and two
gentlemen from Virginia, had said, that the
message of the President amounted to a decla
ration that we were now in war. This idea
he thought stated very incorrertly. The'y
did not seem to have understood the meaning
of the language of the President. The state
of things which existed at the time orders were
ilfued to prevent the arming of merchait ves
sels was ellentially different from the prtfenf ;
then there was an evident disposition in the
owners of velfels to cruise against a foreign
belligerent nation, and the Ofder wasilfiied to
prevent attack and plunder ; but the desire to
arm at present is for the purpose of defence
merely, and not to cruize or plunder. There
is a law forbidding veflels to arm for the pur
pose of cruising ; but none forbidding mer
chants to arm in their own defence. ThiÂ»
was the fair conllrurtion, he believed, of the
meaning of the President."
Mr. Otis ot-fervrd, that the oppofcrs of this a
mendtrent could assign no better reason for declar
ing a desire to keep peace with the French repub
lic to the cxclufion of other nations, than their own
conflruAion of the Prcfident's Jail mcflage, whicb
they confidcrtd VÂ» direded to that republic Â»lone ;
but the house having resolved itfelf into a com
mittee wf the wholv on thÂ« Aatc of tfce unitfti, the
resolution on the table had 110 greater relation to
that message, than to any farmer speech or mt sage,
or to the affairs of the union at large. - If it was
intended as an anfwcr to the melfajje, it fhinild be
moved in that form; but unlcfs it was in 4 parti
cular manner co:n-iicd with it, Ulf f Ã¼bKc couldnot coare.s i' rr.ore naturally with this menage
than with the fptech delivered it the opening of
the fcfiion. The house hid be*n heretofore in
formed that France waÂ« not the only country with
which we had rÂ» f n to apprehend a rdpture â
Spain might he considered, yntil lately, ai having
squally invaded our territory ; & thn'the pn func
tion at present was. thatthecanfeiof conteiitionwith
thatc.untry were removed, thi y were not officially
inforine.l of this i-v-l and without fnch informa
tiÂ»n, it vk not lefn proper to expreft their desire
tA main'aiding p?ace with Sp.i.n than with other
tfoMtics. Again, gentlemen had often intimated
that a war with Trance would involve us in a war
with thnfe nations that arc in " alliance" with her;
it waÂ» tlin-iefore i"e*pcdient to (hew a contempt or
indilPsffltice for them, by leaving them out of our
pacific masifffto.
He confi 1-red the message ill a very different
view from that in which it appeared to other gen
tlemen ; but admitt.ng for the fake of argument
th t their ceaftrsiliou \laÂ» just, an! that the Pr -
fident was really of opini n upon the fails dated by
him that war was inevitableâGentlemen mull con
sider the fa&s to be true j if they doubled, they
ought to demand information. Hew would this
resolution*then fland ? In reply toaffurances that
negotiations had failed ; that our contmiffioners
were treated with Mglect and contempt; that let
ters of marque and reprKal were ifiucd against our
vfffe s, l aml that the molt hostile appearances were
difccrnihle on the part of the Frcn.h; it was ex
pedient to declare that, with them, and w th them
only, it was inexpedient to resort to war. Such a
proposal would hardly be found in the annals ol
the m*<fc humble and degraded nation-
He d:Tipproved ol the resolution, though Vie
ftsuld vote for the amendment, and would not on
the prtljiit occasion follow gentlemen who hod
gone at Ikrge into the merits of the refolutionâU p
-011 ths extent of the rlefcnflve measures propofsd
by g'jntienten, his feelings inclined him to enlarge,
but this discussion would be more pertinent upon
fotne ther question. merely hint that
a*)n-"ii invaiKin might not be the worS calamity to
this country. He could conceive of a partial inva
sion of our territory that would lÂ»= much less inju
rious and attended with much less loft, than the to
tal rum Â«f our commerce.
The. call for the committee to rife being re
peated,
Mr. N. Smith hoped gentlemen would be
fatisfied to take the question, which he tho't i
very unimportant ; the time consumed in dif
cufling it was, however, important, as other
concerns called for attention. He knew there
were gentlemen who chose rather to address
the people of the United States than to legis
late ; he thought it better to legislate, than
to preach to the people. He looked upon
the present resolution as a text from which it j
was intended to alarm the people with rofpeet
to war, and he wished not to indulge gentle
men in their design. He wilhed the question
to be taken for another reason. It was sug
gested by the gentleman from Virginia, that
the melfage of the Prelident was considered
by the people as a declaration of war, and
that reports were in circulation that a treaty
offenfive and defenfive was concluded with
Great Britain. After this, he would call the
attention of the committee to the resolution,
which was, in etfett, to fay, we must inter
fere, or war will be brought upon the coun
try. Did not this go to sanction a report
which was as falfe and malignant as even jaco
biniiin could invent 1 It did, and he hoped
they would not so far sanCtion the report as to
let the motion lie before them undecided.
Mr. D.v y ton hoped the committee would
rife. Tha gentleman last up began with fay
ing the proposition was of no importance ;
but, before lie fat down, (hewed that he tho't
differently. Mr. D. thought it was of im
portance that the committee fhouldcome to a
right decision upon it ; and fay whether is
ought to \)e agreed to in general terms, or re
jected. ,
Mr. N. Smith explained.
Mr. J. Williams thought the question
trifling, and hoped a decilior) would be had
upon it.
Mr. Giles said, the question wasa question
of peace or war, and*yet gentlemen call it
trifling. He did not mean to alarm the peo
of the United States, but he wished them
to understand "their situation. He acknow
ledged hewas hinifelf much a'armed. Gen
tlemen were willing to engage in defenfive,
but not in offenfive war ; but when war was
once begun it would not be in the power of
the United Statas to keep it within the cha
racter of defenfive war. Indeed the gentle
man from MarTachuletts when he fpyke of de
fenfive war, confefi'ed our inability for offen
five war, and tittered a prayer to the Supreme
Being that we were able to engage offenfively ;
and where he aflced, with such sentiments, is
the difference betwixt offenfive anddefenfive
war f He could fee none ; lie deprecated
war of Aery kind.
.Mr. J. Williams hoped the question
would be taken. As he before stated he
thought it trifling, and the debate upon it
only calculated to alarm the people, which
seemed tyjre the object of gentlemen. If
the q it llitewas not taken before they adjourn
ed, much cebate would lie had, and much time
finert to very little purp:.fe. He thought it vety
extraordinary, as no one was founti to bring for
ward a resolution to declare war, that a gentle
man would introdqee a resolution of its being
Â» inexpedient so to do. 'He wis perluaded that
this negative mode of proceeding was calculated
so draw on a debate, to set the people against
the executive. Time, he said, was precious,
they had set near B>c monihsand don' but/little.
Murh remained to be done 1 and as all had de
clared their aversion to a war, [he people should
be undeceived. He had himfelf seen gentle
men write upon the late message of the Pre
fident, for the purpose of fending to their
constituents, " A IVar Message against France."
Mr. Macon wished the gentleman would
name who had thus written.
A call of order took place ; and a motion
was made for the committee to rife, and
carried.
Mr. Clopton, from the committee of en
rolment, reported as duly enrolled the bill de-Â»
daring the assent of Congrefl to an ait of the
state of Maryland for the appointment of a
health-officer; and the bill for continuing in
force the sth section of the poft-oftice and
road aft.
The bill from the Senate for an amicable
fettlemetit of limits with the state of Georgia,
was palled with amendments.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
claims, prepofed a resolution to the hopfe to
the following effect which was ordered to
lie on the table :
" Resolved, That the accounting officers of the
treasury, he and they are berchv directed to adjujl
and fettle the accounts for wages of tbofe non
eimmijianed officers and fildiers in the late \th
MaJfttchuftHS regiment On the continental eftabhfh

in 'pursuance of an ail of Congress, and 'which
flail be jound to have been embezzled by them,
and who consequently remain nupaid for their
serviceS ; and all such ftims which Qall be allow
ed it such officers and soldiers, fball be charged to
the account of the agents by -whom they "were em
bezzled."
The Sfeaker laid before the houfc a re
portof the Assistant Poftiuafter-General on
the petition of the printers of the Baltimore
new (papers. Tlic report fiates thai the irre
gularities complained of are much exaggerat
ed ; that there vftrt a few ijKtances of'delay
during the winter,on accoutftof the obstruct

for wliich the contractors have notwithltand
inrj been called to account. The report also
ftatesthat the great number of exchange pa
pers which pals betwixt the printers of news
papers is very troublesome ; it mentions that
there are fifteeA newspapers printed in this
city, the printers of which receive near 1000
papers in a week, and supposing Philadelphia
to receive one-ninth part of ail the exchange
papers which pass through the port-office, it
mlikes the number about 9000 a week, many
ofwhich it is believed a're of little use, and
are never read by the printers who receive
them. ' The report (uggefts, therefore, the
propriety ot either withdrawing this privilege
altogether, or limiting the number of pipers
to be received by any one printer.âReferred
to the committee onpoft-offices and post-roads.
Wednesday, March 28.
A message -was received from the Preftdent of
the United States, informing the House that he had
approved and fiened the folh-wing ails, viz.â-
To continue in force the 51b fethon of the poft
office and post-road atl : to declare the assent of
Congress to an atl of tbe commonwealth of Massa
chusetts; to provide and support a naval arma
ment ; and an atl jg declare the assent of Congress

lijhment of an health-officer
Mr. Sitg reaves presented the petition of
JpJiah Green, praying for an increase of penjion,
â¢which -was referred to the committee of claims.
Mr. O ris presented the petition \f William
IVhite, of Biflon, praying for a remission of duty
on wines imported, which proved of inferior
quality to what they were stated to be. Ii was
moved to refer this petition to the committee of
commerce vnd manufaelures ; but the chairman
of that committee Rating that the ctmmittee had
uniformly decided against such applications, where
tbe wines were attended with an invoice, tbe
motion was negatived.
Mr. D. Koster, from the committee of
claims, made a report on the petition of James
Swan, who claims a largefum fr,r interest, char
ges and damages in a contrail with the Secre
tary of the Treajury, on a bill'of exchange drawn
on Paris. The report states, that it would be
inexpedient for the legtflature to interfere in the
bujinefs. The report was committed for to-mor
row.
Mr. M'Dowell said, a bill from tbe Senate
to authorize the President of the United States to
I purchase one or more founderies, had been referred
to a committee of the whole, and might be expec
ted fbortly to come under conjideration. As be
had not J'ufficient informattan on this fubjetl In
enable htm to vote underftandingly upon tbe bills
he wished to call upon the proper officer for an
account of cannon purchafedfince the year 1794,
in order to ascertain the necessity or propriety of
passing the proposed lav/. He therefore proposed
the following resolution to the house ;
" Resolved, That the President of the United
States be required to cause the proper officer to lay
before this house, the number of cannon which may
have been purchased for the use of the frigates, the
revenue cutters, and fortifications, since the firfl of
January, 1794, with the size of the cannon, and sta
ting what proportion of them were cast within the
United States, at what founderies,and an account of
the prices paid for each size."
This resolution was agreed to, and Messrs.
M'Dowell and IV. C. Claiborne, appointed a
committee to wait upon the president therewith,
Me. Gallatin observed, that'when the ap
propriations for the military department Were
vefterday under confederation, several sums were
left in blank, for the want of information. He
proposed resolutions to the following effed, ift or
der to obtain that infoimation, which were a
gred to.
" Resolved, That the Secretary of War be
direited to lay before this Houfie, a statement
in detail of the expenditure of the money ap
propriated for the subsistence of the army, for
the quarter-master's andlndian departments,
bounties, defenfive proteftionaf the frontiers,
and of all contingent expences in the war de
partment in the year i 797, from whence reUilt
the deficiencies by him stated in his estimate,
amounting tothe several sums of 114,165 dol
lars, and 50,000 dollars ; and that he include
in the fame statement an estimate of the num
ber of rations issued during that year to the
Indians at the several polls-, See.
" Also, an estimate of the probable appro
priation necessary for the quarter-master's de
partment for the present year.
" Also, a statement of the several existing
contracts made for the fubfiftenceof the army.
The Houfc again resolved itfelf into a commit
tee of the whole on the Stafe of the Union ; when

THURSDAY EVENING, March 29
MR. SPRIGG
Made his_/fr/2 appearance in the " National
7heatre," on Tnffdiy last in the character
of Cat's patv, in a new play called " the
LAST STRUGGLE, OR. FACTION BLOWN
up." Althnughthe managtrs are doubt-'
less entitled to i'ome credit for setting bini
in a charaflcr very obviously adapted to his
capacity and Ration 011 the 11 age, yet it was
not perhaps quite generous to compel him to
make his debut in a fart certainly contemptible,
and by no means calculated to givc eclat to a
new performer. When a man hjs no talents
for afting, no power to force an up-hill cha
rafter, he (hould have parts that aft them
selves ; or be kept entirely as a lacquey, call
boy or fene-Jbifier âThe part was originally
cajl for Mr. M'Clay of the Little Haymarh
et, who entirely failed, getting nothing but
difgrac? for himfeff and contempt for the
part he afted. It was not fair to impose on
Mr. Sprigg's ignorance and good-nature,
and tliruft him cut in a character already
damned, and which the older hands (hrunk
fromâThe broad faced ineonfidency of the
sentiments that have been put into his mouth
is pnly'falculated to make any performer ri
diculous ; how then could Mr. S. stand it,
withont chara&eroi talents to support him ?
The managers fliould recollect that, irr
these cafes,although the poor adW is laugh
ed at and despised, yet they (hare in the
disgrace, and will nave a portion of the
public resentment, as it is well knowrr they
cajl the charaSert and parts, and the poor
players mull obey or forfeit their engagements.
It is said there will be shortly performed for
the benefit of Mr.Giles " The deserter"
to which will be added the comic opera of
the " poor soldier."
THEATRICUS.

COMMVMCATION.
It is conjfdturcd, that the sole reason, '
why tilt- government of thÂ« United States j
have not yet permitted and promoted the
arming of merchant vefftls, as well as those
defenfive preparations, which for a conside
rable time have breri also evidently necessa
ry to the very exigence of our commrtce,
and the proteftion of our cities and coads,
is, That sensible of the prevalence of a de
baftd Sans Culotte fadlion, \#fiich tho' small
had scattered its creatures thougbout the
dates, to foment diforder3 atid create difaf
feftion and nppefition, to any measures
which the present dangerous situation of our
country demands, they have and patiently
wait until the fetife of the people under the
fuffering. of negleft and insult to their roini
ders and pillage of their property (hall of
itfelf point out the plan of security
and redress.âPetitions were once very falh
ionable ! ! !
A Correspondent observes, that the Ja
cobins did not condemn what they called
retaliating measures against Britain in '94,
though simple fclf-defcnce against French
ftrikes ihem with horror. An
old Cronicle of '94, happened to be.before
my eye 3 eur correspondent fays, he was
struck with feeing . the fafety of the Danes
against I?iiti(h depredations imputed to their
having force. The Americans, fays the
Chronicle paragraphift, have pursued a dif
ferent system, and they Have been" pillaged.
Now it seems the arguments taken from
their very mouths are to be scouted.
One would think a mind, not perverted
with French principles, would discern that
it is faftr and more prudent to arm against
France, than against Britain, in '94. Thc
fleets of France are dlfmantledâour worst
robbersnre the single small privateers. To
chastise them we are as competent as in '94,
to contend with the British navy. We hive
now more to fight for, more to fight with,
and less to fight agaioft. Treaty then pro.
cured security and reparationânow more
wrongs and more insults.
Where the executive power in a free state
is weak, foreign influence will prevail. No
truth is more profound, or admits of more |
proof from the nature of men ; no teftimo- â¢
ny from experience is more solemn or enfor
ces its warnings to mankind with more aw- )
ful solemnity or more sanguinary tragedies
âthus is the attempt to break down and
eypherize our President so often renewed af
ter being baffled ?âbecaufe foreign faftion
exids among us, and the President as well
as virtue and the laws stand in their way,
therefore they try to remove all these obfta
cJes. Suppose the French for instance had
the upper hand here, the President would
be no more than chairman of a committee ;
a player who would strut his hour on the
stage and be dismissed.
This remark is addrefied to men of sense .
and to the watchful friendr of liberty. Let
them read the debates of Congress on the
appropriations for foreign ministers, and let
them be purfuaded that the "attack on our
Constitution is closely conne&ed with the
servile devotednefs of a party sb France.
By this day's Mail.
NEW-YORK, March 28.
The following resolution pafied the House
of Afle'mblyof this State, the 19th inft.
" Resolved, That his Excellency the Go
vernor be requested to caufeto belaid before
this hjufe, an edimate of the sums neces
sary, and means to be adopted for putting
the city and port of New-York in a refpeft
able date of defence ; and that he be also ;
reqirefted to inform this house, whether there j
be grounds to expetl the co-operation of !
the government of the United States in de- I
fraying the expence attending this objeft." 1
Mejfage from his Excellency the Governor. \
GENTLEMEN,
In pursuance of your resolution of the
19th inft. I have taken measures to be in
formed of the present intentions of the gov
ernment of the United States, rela
tive to putting the city and port of!
; New-York in a refpeÂ£table of de- ;
fenceâon receiving that information, it (hall!
be immediately communicated to you.Â»
As the constitution of the United States
has committed to our national government |
the power and the means, and the duty of
providing for the national defence, it is to
; be expefted, as well as hoped, that due at
. tention will be paid to the security of a city
and port so obviously and eflentially import
ant, not only to this State, but to the Uni
ted States.
But at this jun&ure, when prudence
' forbids delay, it in my opinion deserves to
: be considered, whether it would be advifea
! ble for the Ligiflature to adjourn until they
! fee this great objeft provided for ; and whe
ther existing circumstances do not judify a
canfidense that the United States will cheer
j fully aflume the expence of such judicious
' measures as this State nyy take for that
purpose.
Urgent considerations also recommend that
our supply of arms and stores be seasonably
augmented, and made ample, and that no
time be loft in perfefting those military ar
rangements and eftabliihmeuts to which
menacing circupiftances admonish "us ;o at
tendâon these fubjefts the Legislature al
ready poflcfs much information, and I ex
pert soon to furnifh you with additional de
tails ; at present it may be proper to ob
serve that according to an estimate made
the lad year, about sixty thousand dollars
\ will be necessary to finifli the fortification|on
the three Islands in the harbour of New-
York- JOHN JAY.

and their hcarrs are gradually Opened to fero;i
ty and violence. Their present le. 1 filters de
clare that every pnvrrnment but their ovn is a
tyrannical ufurpanon ; .mil thev are preachii.p
up iHJiirreiftions as the m ifl f JC -ed duty of the
citizens. \\ hit then are we to t-xpefl froth luch
a nation ?---a nation who are abandoned to ev
ery fen fe of honorâ 3 nation who have been guil
ty 1 f so many unprtiveke,! asgrrObns upon

miration, mothers rejoicing in the death of their
sons ; fans devoting their lathers to the mur
derer's sword. Great God ! grant tha fa h a
fyllem may never be eftah'.iflied on the ruins of
the Britilh conflitution !
" Much has been said here of an invifion 5
but it is the general opinion, that we hive no
thing to fear on that head ; thoHgh I think we
have every thing that is bad to dread from a
continuation of the war-rit is that which will
turn the people against the governmentâit is
that, and that only, which will ever give the
French a footing 011 Enghfh ground, Birt I
trust the example of Flanders and Holland will
befufficient to deter us from embracing the de
ftruflivc fraternity of France. I mention, witli
regret, the gleomy clouds of misery, v hich
seem to be impending over our heads, and which
if we do not life every exertion to expel the
ambition and rapacity of France, will,' in all
probability, fall upon us. Pitt's triple tax-bi.l
has met with a very unpopular reception j and
lam fully of opinion there will be a change of
ministry, as it is morally impoffiblc for
pie to exist much longer under their burthens.
The militia were never known so outra
geous as at present. They adl m if they had
the whole power in their own hands. Domes
tic happmefs they have invaded. The poor arc
either compelled by force, or drawn in by Arat
agem, to enter into the fervict of warâthe
peaflnt is dragged from his fottage to be train
ed for battle, which his foul abhors âthe plough
man row quits his plough and peaceful hamlet,
and she mechanic his work-shopâthe young
men are obliged to defcrt the hymeneal altar,
and abandon infirm fathers, weeping mothers,
and affiled families. Thousands will here be
facriSced to gratify the pride, the caprice and
folly of an unthinking few. Notwithflanding
markets art high, and a number of poor peo
ple out of employ, it don't prevent the sorest .11-
1 A from having their granaries filled with graitj
