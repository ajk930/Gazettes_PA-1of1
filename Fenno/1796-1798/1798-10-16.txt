yellerday, has the following important de
e ; tail, which we can fay obtains very geberal
II .belief in the highest and bed informed cir
-0 cles. [â ?Â«Â«â¢] |
r j The article is dated from Frankfort, and
1 states,
, j That by advices from Trieste atid likf
j } wife from another port in Italy, an account
c j had been received of an action having taken 1
; ] place between the Engiifh and French fleets !
- | in the Mediterranean. The circumltances '
s j which are particularly detailed, are as sol
-! low :
t "Oh the 17th Mefiidor (July sth) the
hostile fleets met in the morning. A very
close and warm engagement ensued, which
, lasted (he whole day, and ended at night
without vidtory having declared on either
fide. The two following days, the 6th and
7th of July, were calm, and the flee's lay
in fight repairing their damages. On the
Bth, the Englith fleet being favoured by an
1 easterly wind, fuccceded in cutting off eight
French ships of the line, with which a very
close and desperate adtion immediately took
place. It ended, by a vidtory
declaring in favour of the British, the whole
: eight ships beirfg taken or funk.
I " The adtion was extremely bloody on
1 both fides, the crew of the L'Orient (Bu
; onaparte's ship) having bÂ«en repeatedly re
inforced by draughts from other ships which
were not so clofelv engaged. The L'Ori

p who was badly wounded, was removed on
( board the Culloden, where he had the fatif
fadtion of receiving Buonaparte and bi3
whole etat-major, about two hours before
he (fir Horatia) died of his wounds."
.Such is the detail of this article in Le
Clef du Cabinet, to which, as we have al
, ready observed, great credit is attache s here,
! and which seems to be too circumftascial to
. be wholly the fidtion of a French editor, for
, which he would be liable to pay the forfeit.

however, to form their own opinions and

We yesterday evening received, by ex
press, Paris pipers to the 29th inft. [Sun.]
The Parisians have at length received irÂ»
telligenco of the arrival of Buonaparte at
Alexandria. No official information of this
fadt has yet been publilhed, ner are any ad
ditional circumstances known at Paris res- :
pedticg the destination of the expedition.
An aiticlein a Frankfort paper copied into
L Echo de la Republique Frarcoife of the j
28th inft. contains an account of seven
ships of th; line, seven frigates and a brig,
part of Admiral Nelson's squadron, having
from the course the admiral fleered, reached
Alexandria on the 38th June, ten daya be
fore the squadron ef Buonaparte arrived at
that p'>rt, and not meeting with the French
fleet there, having put to sea. This intelti- !
gence is Hated in a letter from Conftaoti- 1

by an Imperial vessel which left Alexandria 1
on the 30th June, and which was the bearer 1
of official difpatthes on the fubjedt.

-PHILADELPHIA,
' TUESDAY EVENING, OCTOBER 16.
i THE Subscriber prematurely borne
forward to a iituation bf high refpon
' ' Ability, hopes the candour and con
sideration of his friends, not dwelling on
- the errors arid wanderings of his career,
- will find for them an apology in the
heat and inexperience of Touth. It
hath pleased Heaven to put a period to
' the labours of him who had for ten
- years conducted to public admiration, the
- Gazette of the United States. AwaÂ»
1 kened from mental distress, at the aflli<st
e ing bereavement, his fuccdTor feels him
. felf overcome in the consideration of the
r weighty task which has devolved on him:
" He is but too conlcioas that he stands
in " the breach the angry angel made, 1 "
c only to render it the rrori conspicuous
: a breach, alas ! not foop. to be filled.
- Notwithstanding the - flattering opinions
1 of friendfliip, which ever watchful for
r ' indications on which to ground the
: most favourable predictions, often cre
s ates them by the mere force of imagina
-1 tion, lie is fearful that his friends will
, with more difficulty diftinguiih the mens
, ahnormh fapietis, crajfaque Minerva, than
) the unattempered fire and indif<;retion of
youthful inexperience: To them and
the Public, however he pledges the best
exertions of that portion of judgment
and of talents, which nature has allotted
him: For the rectitude of his intentions,
he can with confidence make an high
appeal. Immergjng to aftive life, at a
period big with events of immense mag
nitudeâa period at which the world
seems trembling on a point,âoll the
mighty turn of which rests happiness or
woe, it will be his highest aim to strength
en the existing barriers round the pub
lic weal, and to contribute in railing
new pillars to the decaying edifice of
public virtue.
.It may be of some interefi: to those
who look for a continuance of entertain
ment and information through the me
dium of this Gazette, to the lead
ing features by which it is proposed to
diftinguiih the publication: On this
head the Subscriber thinks fit to be
brief; and here happily he reflects with
pleasure that his course is already so plain
ly marked out /or him, as to leave little
to be said, and few new fields to be ex
plored.
It was his happy lot to be blefled with
parents exemplary in their lives, and
in their end. Hence is derived the
lweeteft conlolation for their loss. It
was their fortune while living to con
tract the esteem of that part of man
kind whole good opinion is most valu
ble. Hence naturally resulted the fincer
eft sensibility at that dispensation which
removed them to a brighter world. Of
them most truly may it be faidâMul
tis Mi bonis flebllis occiderunt.
To point out the cause of this efti-.
mation, is to illustrate the precise objeft
of his highest ambition. That line of
conduct which has been found, after a
long course of experience to have con
traced general admiration and applause,
could not be .deviated from without in
curring the just charge of raftinefs.
And this .brings him to state,âThat his
constant endeavor will be to conduct this
paper in such manner, (particularly in re
gard to the leading principles of its poli
tics) as to leave the reader as little sensi
ble as poflible, that it has passed into
new hands.
He begs leave to offer the most heart
felt gratitude for the generous counte
nance and iupport he has received, and
the most lively and ever-living recollec
tion of the private friendfhip he has ex
perienced ; hoping to bring about the
time when, more than at prefect, he may
be able to derive that in some degree
from personal merit, which now he at
tributes to a kind refpeft and esteem
iA - the virtues of a departed parent.

PROPOSALS, i
BY THE
Injur ance Company of North America.
For Insurance against Fiki, on Dwelling-
Houses, Ware-Houses, and other Buildings (am?
on Goods contained in such Building*) diflant from
PhiUdelphia, in the United States.
I* Common l'Â»rurancrÂ«, on hazards of the firft
class, wili be undertaken at a premium of about
hall per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous
rifqaes a larger pretrium will be required, "which
will vaiy according to circu"*iftanceÂ», feidoai ex
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; bat in some i-n
---ftances, where the property insured U not only in
itfe'f extra hazardous, but rendered still more Co
by the tic in ity of r*tra hazardous buildings and
occupations, rhepÂ»emium demanded will be raised
according to cirewmftanres.
Houses and 'Ware-Houses, the wall* and parti
tions of which are wholly of stone or brick, well
Conftru<sted, so as to bÂ» guarded as well asmay be
against fires from within, and Iree from extra ha
zardous buildings and occupations in their neigh
borhood, will he deemed hazardous of the firft
class, iÂ»d may be insured to their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not ot an extra
hazardous kind, in eafks. bales, or packages, de
* port ted in such build' n g*> to an amount not ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; but if more than this sum
is required to be insured in one- tenement, an addi>
tioaal premium will be required, in proportion -to
circumstances. '
11. 'rfuranee= will also be made on building? and
go<id< extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to th.i rifqu'. But it is not e=fy to arrange th.ffe
under j>nr*ieular heads or ciafTes, so as to defaibe
wch with the necelfary accuracy. Each cafe must
therefore he decided upon according to thecircum
ltaiices a-tending it ; and these circumstances wili,
in general, appear from the description accotnpa
uyTg tie application,
Buddings partly eonftrufled of brick or stone,
are preferable to those wholly wooden. And in i
both cases, the fiile of buiWing, how they are oc- i
cupled, how they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how'occupied, are eosfiderations to ,
be taken ir.to view. And with refpeft togoods,
their tendency, whether from their nat*re, or |
from the manner in which they are exposed, either
to commence or to Increase an accidental fire, aisd I
their liability jn such state to receive damage by i
wet, or by sudden and hasty removal, or to be ito-1

figncd or not.
fd. Insurances may be renewed at the expira
t'on cl the term of the policy, without furtherex
p-rfes than the payment of the premium of the re
new ed term, the circumftancescontinuing the fame
as they were under flood by the Infiirers at the time
t'l;former insurance was made ; but the payment
<Â»f the premium is elTentiul to such renewal ; ano
if the party insured fullers anytime to elapse after
the expiratiop of theformeririfurar.ee, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
durirg such H:i'e ; Â«or nthednfuranee be renew

commencement of the renewal from the expiration
of the former,infurance. The fubjefl of inlbr
