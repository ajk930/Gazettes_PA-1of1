nation. His opponents will fink into ob
scurity under the weight of universal con- 1
tempt and be viewed as traitors to our coun- j
try. The jacobins this way appear to be j
. struck dumbâthey begin to join the gene
ral voice in execrating the perfidy of the 2
.French. Union through the nation must be
â¢the consequence. But let ns not be deceiv

The luperlative folly of making long fpe.eh-1 1

to get a aame for great banting with their | '

from (he delay of national concerns, mor; <
than sixty thotifand dollars have been waft- 'â¢

abominableâit raises dil'gutl and indigna- '

My regards to , I take it he pieferves :
his former moderation with regard to the
French. The late dispatches do not hurt
their charafter, in my mind, and I conceive
they 1-fe none of his esteem thereby. They
are secure from finking, if there should be
any alteration in thsir character, they must '

A Corrrefpondent observes, that not

fnlts offered to the nation in the persons of

men yet found among us, who, likt the de

themfelves,but their country in ruin. Like
that falfe and perfidious harlot, the rulers
of France hare been long makingprotections
of their " unbounded friendlhip" for the
people of the United Slates, while they
and their emissaries were using every possible
means to work their deftruftion, by endea
voring to divide us, and alienate a majority
of the reÂ»p!e frwis thf gcurrrntrsnt.

Citizens of /merica,
Already, on the fubjet't of French hoftil
;ities meditated against us, a geneious emu
lationhas manifefted itfelf every where ; the
cities ai d diltrifts throughout the country
afe vying with ench other for the hojÂ»or of
deserving well of their country. The great
est examples of patriotism are exhibited eve
ry whet* : the American commerce, which
is feniible of the advantages of peace, of
fers the riches it had gained in prolperous
times j and its (hips heretofore employed in
'the peaceful speculations of iudtiftry, aie
ready to ?rm for the terrible operations of
war. If proof were wanting, our late dif-.
patches will fufficiently demonstrate the fuc
cefiive and multiplied injuries of the French
government towards us; and of the repeat
ed, candid, and sincere attempts which we
have made to avoid a ruptqre, the fatal con
fluences <>f which must sooner or later fall
on thofewho have unjultly provoked it. The
American republic will have nothing to re
proach herfelf with, since (he will have ex
iiaulled every means compatible with her
dignity, before coming to such extremities.
The French nation, forgetting what they
had.so often promised, not to interfere inthe
dometlic affairs of other nations, have taken
occafiori, from the firft ftntiment of indig
nation expieffeu inour President's lad speech
to put the last hand to their enmity against
the Americao people. That picture of its
conduit delireatedin the recent communica
tions from our Envoys, and which it is now
unnecessary again to pourtray, must have
prepared you for this event. At that peri
od it miijht still have been expefled, that
reason would b ing back the Dir*dtory to
the principles of justice, that convinced cf
the futility of their reclamations, the injuf
ijje of thtir proceedings, and of their per
fections against us ; it might have still
been hoped, I repeat,, that they would aban
don their chicane'y, and honestly concur
with the executive of America, for the
maintenance of peace" between the two na
tions. That hope, which men abhorring a
war between free nations, clwriihed, that
hope is no rrore ; the hoftilc\iews of France
are fully d-.vcloped. If war was not imme
diately declared against you, it is because
the neefffary forces were not readyto dtilroy
you, because it was hoprd you might be
come the aggressors. Such, however, is
now our political fhuation, in which, citi
zens, let one idea eleÂ£te.riz.e your foulsâ
Let the Trader forget bis commerce to aria
his veffi.l for war ; let the Cipitalift co: fe
crate his funds to sustain the- credit of his
government ; let the Proprietor and Culti
vator,renouncing all fpccuiatiwns,carry plen
ty iato our markets. Let Americans com-
pose but one army ; let America he one t
camp. Let us prepare for ruins and mis- c
fortunes, and accustom ourselves to live
without those comforts we have been ?;ctif- t
tomed to. What you tr- - tt, fear-, is aot j h
a war, but the uncertainty -.vuelher you (hall | t
hate a war. This will icxpend your re- a
faurces without profit. .They wait till their 1
fleets erÂ« coniplttely araied andsequippfd ; t
till anarchy shall divide you, that-in dread of
taxes, you (hal! become #n easy prey to be 1
swallowed up by them. You have nothing t
left but to draw the sword and make a firm t
and united stand. r
MR. FENNO,

the two nations, and ag*(n to place tham on

CITIZEN MINISTER,
" The undersigned Envoys Extraordina
ry and Miniiters Plenipotentiary of theUni
' ted States of America to the Freeh Repub
lic, had the honour of "announcing to you
officially, on the 6th of October, their arri
val at Paris, and of presenting to you on
the eighth, a copy of their letters ofcredence.
Your declaration at that time, that a report
on American affairs was then preparing;
arid would in a few days be laid before the
j Direftory. whose decision thereon should
1 without delay, be made known, has hithei J
to'impofed silence on them. For this com
munication they have waited with that anx

could riot fail to excite, and with that re
fptil which i 9 due to the government of
Ftance. They have not yet -received it,
[ ar:d so much time has been permi ted to e
lapse, so critical is the situation of manyef
j. their countrymen, and so embarrafling is
that of the undersigned, both as it refpeits
theinfelves and the government they repte
sent, that they can no longer dispense with
1 the duty of soliciting your attention to
their million.

, " The United States, citizen minister,
s at an epoch which evinced their sincerity,
f have given inconteftjble proofs of their ar
dent friendlhip, of thtir affeftion for the
. French republic : these were the result,
, not of her unparalleled prowess and power,
_ but of their confidence in her justice and
â  magnanimity ; and in such high efticnatiÂ®n
. was the reciprocity of her friendlhip held by
[ them, as to have been a primary objeft of
e national concern. The prefervatioti of it
. was dear to them, the loft of it a fubjeft
. of unfeigned regret, and the recovery of it
r by every roeafure, which (hall consist with
the rights of an independ:nt nation, enga
j ges their constant attention, The govern
â mentof the United States, we are author
r, ized to declare, has examined, with the
. most fcrupnlous justice, its condudt towards
its former friend. It has been led to this
I by a sincere desire to remove of itfelf every
s just cause of complaint ; conceiving that,
_ with the mod upright intentions, fucb cause
v may pofiibly exist ; and although the ftr:Â£t
e eft search has produced no felf reproach, al
. though the government is confcioUa that it ,
t has umformily fought to prefe ve, with fi
-0 delity, its engagements to France, yet far
f from wiftiing to exercise the privilege of
judging for itfelf on its own course of rea- '
. foning arid the lights in its own possession,
[j it invites fair and_ candid discussion ; it fo
_ licits a y reconsideration of the past ; it is
r persuaded its intentions, its views, and its
e actions must have been mifrepnefenttd and
. misunderstood ; it i?convinced that the ef
j fential interests of both nations will be pro
t moted by reconciliation and peace, and it
e cherifiics the hope of meeting with finpilar
. difpofitipns on the part of the diriftory.
" Guided by these the Pre
f fident of the United States has given it in

- feels at the loss or fufpenlion of the harmony
- and friendly iutercourfe which subsisted be
-3 tween the two republics, and his sincere wish

i'- Copy of a letter from New Jersey, dated
a- April 3.
<- DEAR SIR,
it REMOTE as I am situated from the
e- great theatres of politics, I can hardly be
jf supposed capable of forming a just idea of the ;
t, (late of our affairs with re(peÂ£t to foreign
e- powers. The papers which circulate here I j
as occasionally read, but there are (ui.li con- i
is tradiftory fentimeuts broached by one and
ts the other, that it is almost impofiible to
e come at the truth. One tells us our g<)v->
:h ernment is administrated by men fold to
to Great Britainâanother, that there it a par
ty among us determined to go any lengths
in juftifying the French* Thc\t such men
' as are in the Departments of our government
(fcould be capable of the vilentfs of corrnp
tion, is, I think, an idea rathtr ridiculous,
t especially if the temptations to it are eon
' trafted with those to a contrary condudt. I
fufpeft those who make this charge are wic
ked and weak, and to be despised, require
only to be known.
0 p With refpedt to the idea of a French par
ty disposed to make this country fubfervieat
to the vievvs of their favorite nation, I have
every reason to believe in its existence. Eu-
thuliafts there are as well in politics
a _ as religion. These are usually stimula
ted by the defperatear.d defigni"g, and fuf
fer themselves ta be made tools for personal
] a ends by men, who deserve to be spurned for
their villainy and detested for their parricide
j views.
Your city politicians, however Mfe and
t penetrating thsy may t'nink themselves,
are often, very often wrong, and aft more
like madmen than persons of reflettion and
j_ sense. How ridiculous, for example, was
j t it a few years back, to make such pompous
- demonltrations of nuutr ality as you did,
Jf by ringing your bells Â«n receiving news of a
French viAory ? I have often wondered we
a _ Â«did not fer your papers filled with -accounts'
of the tolling of bells whenever the French
j' met with a reverse. Surely your sensibility
â¢ s must have been equally alive to both ex
tremes. Whence then this inconsistency ?
We, in this quarter, think morf of our
agriculture and our Commerce, the affe&i
onate twiti-fifters of America, than to be
j t eterually damning one nation and extolling
jr another, especially when we owe verjr little
real regard to either. We believe our obli
gations extend only to such duties as spring
e " from the relations inseparable froni com
n merceâWe are not impressed with notions
thatfacrifices are tobe madeat the imaginary
,e (lirine of gratitude. We aft nationally and
T rationally, and attach ourselves to those who
5 " can, and, do, benefit us moll.
We dot fee how an American can admire
lc France, espouse her cause, or juflify the
J conduft, either generally with regard to her
J " world, or particularly as to us.'' The infor
'' matiqn we receive from the papers as I have
'' said, is contradiftory ; but what we
: depend on, is official orr.mur.icatioiu, and
they lead us to believe Prav.ce is our enemy,
i Indeed what can gain-fay it ? Would a
' friend roband plunder y.vÂ» ? The arifweris
- obvious,r 1 fimiilhea a i~. aclory evidence
- whom Â«c are to and Â».iom re- i;|
- probate. Why should we contend about
- the' measures we ore th take to secure mir
felves.from insult and depredation ? Would
i yqu not arm yourfelf if you expe&ed to
> meet a scoundrel notorious for his robberies? ,
; Would "you not at Uqft avoid die peftiferous
- being, who declares another is warranted
in pilfering your property ? Would you not
in faÂ£t, think it proper to get rid of him ?
Tell us how those who reduce us. to the ne- f e
ceffity of keeping our produce rotting on th
our hands, when foreign markets are open cc
to receive it, can be friendly ! 'j 1
I hope soon to fee a different spirit aftu
ating your politicians than has latterly dif- t j,
graced them. When the country is in dan
ger, the mao who advocates the foe, is an ta
enemy,;and fliould be expelled with horror V
I and i'gpominy. Let us, if pofiible, avoid
s tile lligma of republicsâdisunion and faÂ£t- u
r ious extravagance. Let us keep out of our C(
- Councils, and, if neceflary, diive from a- w
n mong us, the men who excite discord and ft
!, coiifufiofl. Let u rally under the Ameri- si
can Standard, and cordially unite in taking Â«
1, care of ouffelvcs. We fhal: then be power- f
e ful and rife into our proper grade of polili-
h cal importance. e

? Mr. Otis would not pretend to judge of

' (elves ready to adopt effectual rireafures for
i the defence of the country according (o theif
i conception of that object, but he thought
their ConftrtiCl ion of the terms, " defence of
the country," was extremely limited and par
. tial. It in ordinary cases, it was requiJite for
the illullratiouof a question, t# agree upon the
" ' diiiuition of terms', it was (fill more iiupotf
i tant on the present iraporunt occalionâ
r Whenthe gentlematr from Per.nfylvania and
J others speak of tilt defence of the country,
tltey evidently mean to confine their ideas to
a defence Â«f the/w7. He on the other iiaiu(
r conceived that the efTential part of a country
was the people ; and when he considered tha
d fubjeCl of defance, he uilhcd that it might be
!- such a defence as would embrace the whole
g ma-l's of thecitizens distributed into different
.. pro-fdllions, and together confuting wirit he
â¦called the country. The foil was no other*
l " wife deferring of protection, than as it iol in -
ed a portion of Cue property of Â£Â»he cinzens.
U, was withoutdoubt ah<e j4*ii;{tpVi, andaaofl
valuable portion ; but there were other kinds
of property which for the fame reason had
also claims to protection. The Ibip of a mer

thing sacred in the foil, difHn.t from thepeo
's pie who inliabit it. Many extensive '.rafts
â of the foil of this country ; deep moaafles,
trackless swamps and howling delarts were of
no value whatever; yet they belong to the
a ' people; they are a part of our public or j .ri -
vate property, which no man would feci .tu
rn thorized formally to abandon,
of Mr. O. would agree that sometimes the re
n. sources of a country would not be found e-
Q f qual to the protection of all the citizens or
of all their property. In such inflances he
allowed that a preference due to themofi
he numerous class of citizens and to the mod
iy valuable part of their property all were
e- equally exposed to danger Bift when a go

*" a left defenceleis and exposed. It is an aggra
"e vation of the misfortune to declaie this imbe

every part of our extensive coast is capable of
ml defence, or that our refotirces will enable us
ne to fortify all our ports and h;.rb>;m. But
nt have we said to any part of the people of our
| ie country, "It will be too expenfive'r? protect

" Look, here or there and you v/ill find us

ol means of defence will b - employed and :>n
â¢ld portioned to the belt advantage; but .f It
were doubtful whether Geor-ia or Maine
could be put into a polture of defence we
should hardly declare to those diftriih., or to
the world, that we thought them untenable.
Yet this is the amount of the proposition or'
11- the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and il is it*,
ic- this view of it, he w#Sjiftoiii(hed to find it in
;r( troduced. He had often heard from gentle
men the alTertion that we were not ab 1 " to
protect bur own commerce ; and that our iit
_ inoft means were equivalent only to a ten to
rial defence. He would not comment upon
r, the truth or policy of such remaj-ks. He did
not however expeCt that a proclamation of
them in the form of this amendment would
have been ottered for the sanCtion of th*
honfe. Yet this is ffriCtly the fact. V/e are
> invited to fay that we will guard
invasion ofourlhores, but not against tne wa;-
ton and unjust attacks of our'p operty at lea
That we will defend what is not exposed to
danger; and deleft what is every' momeat
liable to deltruCtion. v If this system is robe
adopted upon the eve of a war, we may as
well fubtr.it at once to the proud and on.
preflive nation, of whose conduct we com
plain.
But the quellion reenrsrâ Do the United
States polTefs the meai)3 of proteCtin-' tJieir

iiu mediately after the coticlufion of a peace;
Upon a recent view and fÂ«ir ettiinate of the
pain and loss of a naval edablifhinent, a refo
on wasltiti adopted declaring a refpectablj
marine to be a desirable object, and recom
mending to the dates, to provide funds for its
accomplilhment. In the notes on Virginia
(an authority he was fond of quoting) the e'x
pediency, of a naval armament' is also advo
â¢cated. Besides, Sir, said he, why have we
not equal ability t<Â» build and maintain a na>,
with the (fates of Denmark or Sweden, whose
population and refourcesare inferior to ours ;
Why cannot this cwuntry provide a fleet, as
well as Peter the Great of Ruftia, at a time
when hii were jult emerging from
B irbarifra, *nd when the arts were imperfectly
known in his country ? It may t>? said, indeed,
that this n*is atchieved by the force of despo
tism.; but he believed that the force of pa
triotism rould effect much greater miracles j
that the free American could serve his coun
try mere effectually than the Ruliian Boor,
mid that the impulse of liberty was a greater"
stimulus than the lath of the Knout.
But it is objefied to this power of granting
convoy, that this employment of the velTels
wouid be a cause of war. [Mr. Gallatin said
he did m>t fav it would be a cause of war, but
that it ivouid be war] Mr. Otis replied that
he could not conceive that an aÂ£t perfectly
confident with the laws of nations and a date
of neutrality fiiould be considered as aÂ£Wai
warâno principle was more indisputable than
this right of convoy. It had been denied
with great audacity, but it culdnot be doubt
ed by any man moderately Conversant with
the law of nations, or who had read a history
â¢ f modern Europ*. A ditference had been
hinted between the situation of the northern
) owe) s of Europe at the period of the armed
neutrali'y, and the date of this country ; but
this right had been exerciled prion to thefor
lliat on of tiie armed neutrality, and has been
uniformly aliened and adopted in praftise
during the present war. On Â«he! 27th of.
March 1794, a new convention was framed i
between Denmark and Sweden, recognizing
this right and resolving upon a naval Force to
maintain it. [He read this convention] In
the fame year we find that a demand was pre
ferred byiheie powers to the Britidi Govern
ment for an indemnity for tltstr captured (hips
and property. An ample compensation was
itiad?, yet the fleets of Sweden and Denmark
were not e<jual to the Britiih fleet ; but the
equipment discovered a determination to de
fend and vindicate their rights and it produ- 1
fed its effect. But how was this convoy, Mr. 1
Oiis alked equivalent to actual war ? Is it
because our ved'els will not submit to be
icarched by the French ? If this be deemed 1
bv gentlemen equivalent to an aitual (late ot 1
war, it will'not be induced but may be pre- ;
vented by convoys ; for under prelent cir- i
cumftances a private veirel may r.lii't the at
tempt to search when deditute of a convoy. I
Does the ptntleman from Pennfylvariia then I
intend, that this bill will amount to a decla- \l
ration of war ? That cannot be pretendedâ 1
Or will itafford a pretext for war! It is too I
late to tiunk of avoiding pretexts. France 1
wants 110 pietexts, (he waits oiily for conveni- 1
ence. She threatened to ravage your coads; (he 1
warned you of the fa eof Venire ; the feet 1
of the nation are raised to trample on your
necks, their bayonets are burni(hed to plunge '
into your bosoms. The war with England 1
affords her fumcient employment at present ; I
let them (ucceed in their enterprize againd I
her, and then fee whether you will elcape ;
from opprtfiion and war. j
Great reliance has been placed upon the ]
afTertion that tjie late decrees of the Direclo- (
ry affeft only an inconlicferable and difidvjn- t
tageouspvt of our commerce. Our carriage c
â¢f Britiih goods and our direct trade with the [
Britiih dominions ; in which branches of c
commerce the Britiih will exclude us, from 1
their ability to convoy and to carry at a cheat
per rate. It is further said, that if we remain r
at peace, our trade wiii be umnoleded, ex- }
eept in the cases fpecified in those decrees, Â«
but that a rupture with France, will deprive 1
us of not only her trade, but of all the nati- c
ons in alliance with her orunderhercontroul. \
Ke wondered greatlythat gentlemen did not I
perceive the limple arifwer to these objecti-, a
onsâln all those cases if their arguments t
were jult, there would be no occasion for the t
employment of convoy, and the velfels would p
either not be purchased or they would be de- t
(lined to some other use. To defend the v
coad, or to protect the transportation of our 1
troops aud military (lores. But he did not c
believe in the solidity of the(e arguments â (
France did not mean to permit this country r
to carry cm airy Specie* oi commerce, that< v
she could preventâno gentleman could feri- [
otifly believe that (he would confine herfrlf,
though unjud aud cruel in a high degree, to
the letter or spirit of her late decrees. We 1
have authentic information that (he captures
all (lie meets, and the Arch Buccaneer of the v
Welt Irtlies has publilhed an edict purporting t
that nothing mult be fufFered to efcapeânei- â

a war with a nation, (hould be (hut out .

can carry chea pert. At present for this rea
lon, it is principally derived from this coun- a
try. It isa monlirous supposition that France Â«
ihould acquire such an ascendant in Europe e
a 4 to compel Spain, Holland, the Hanfe n
Towns, Rudia <nd the Italian Hates to fore- g
close our commerce, and to deprive â theni
felves of the advantages of purchasing sup- c
plies frontllvofr who can furnith them with e:

was obdructed 111 a direÂ£t coiufe would be -j
caiTied on circuitotifty ; but dill it would con
tinue, and if protected, it would flourilh.
The eliect therefore of denying convoy to our
merchants will be to destroy this great and
beneficial carrying trade ; to transfer its emo
luments to other nations ; to annihilate forty a
millions worth of (hipping and to itarve or bÂ«-
nifh sixty thousand lailors and their families
Upon the value of our lands ar.d produce,
the operation of this amendment 'would be q
highly pernicious. The farmers have been
aiuuled with the ideS, that if our own -velfels
embargoed, the Britiih and neutral (hips a
will come hitljrr for their produce, and that
their interfrft w.il not fufier. But it Ihould
be remembered that with respect to the pro
duce of our country, tlxve is a great diffe
itiice betw cen seeking and waiting for a mar
ket. It chiefly confills of provilions and the
if it%r.ines of life, with which nature 111 fume
nieafiires, provides all countries; âAs the F<
â¢euioni vary, as the harvell is more or lefsa

, It has been arlferted within these walls and
- echoed throughout this continent that we are
- going to war in Support of Brijilh marmfac
; tures, and ot a trade tile ballance of which
- is agauitt uj. To Jliew the difitdvantage of
, our trade with Britain, it has been inlifted
r- that in the lad year France has taken eleven
millions of our exports and Great Britain but
J eight millions and an half. But he would
i alfert that either ihis comparative of our ex -
1 ports was not an infallibte ted of'the relative
t advantages ps our trade, or if it be so, the
t fame principle taken lor a series of years is in
f favour of ottr trade with Great Bri'tain.âln
: the year preceding the lalt our exports to
I Great Britain were twenty three millions.â
1 To France eleven millionsonlyâBy the report
I of Mr. JefFerloo in 1794 funned upon a view
of our commerce in peacable times, wefentto
1 Great Britain ftine millions anlnuully, and to
France about four millionsâl it the year 1785
1 it appears by a memorial of the Britiih mer
-1 chants to the king, that such is the natural
tendency of our export-trade in favor of Great
Britain, that although Germany and Holland
wanted annually of tobacco,
they could obtain but 5000, and that out of
15000 hogllieads for which the French market
I would aftiird-a file, they would get from us
' but twelve hundred. The reft was lent to
Great Britain.
Gentlemen may contend that a great-part of
our experts to Sruain is re-exported ; but
the quantity thus re-exported is not precisely
known, nor can. it conclude againd the geite
ral position. The markets of other countries
being open, we Ihould carry these exports di
reÂ£lly thitiier, if it were not"conven;ent-atid
advantageous to permit theuito center inGreat
Britain, and whether they are remitted in ex
change for merchandize which we want and
cannot obtain on equal terms from other coun
tries ; or as a fund to facilitate our negocia
tions and commerce in other parts of tiie
world, it equally refulti that this bias pro
ceeds from that commercial sagacity which is
always acute to discern aud active to pursue
its tme~4tttcre{i.
He would further add that the exports of"
the lad year for another reason were not the
true criterion of trade. The depredations of
*the French corsairs had already increased to a
degree which induced many to clear out for
the French dominions, when theaiitual delli
nation was to some other country âand of the
nominal elevefi millions appearing to be thus
cleared out, only three millions confided of
our own produce or manufactures.
Mr. 0, said, that he wouid not take the
wide range of the gentleman from Corineifti
cut (Mr. nor give the fame icope
to his feeling's. Gentlemen agreed that the
time was arrived, for placing the country in
a date of defence, and declared themselves
ready to adopt certain measures for this pur
pole. For these profellions he gave them due
credit, but their measures were not adequate
to the objed. He never would agree to de
clare that this country could not or would not
protect its commerce, nor alfent to a process
of outlawry againd all the merchants, mecha
nics and fai ors in the United States. He
thought it not very honorable to fay to the
merchants, " proceed in your commercial
projects, and in the event of yourfuccefs we
sxp'etta portion of your earnings to bellow
upon the protection of the other classes of the
community." The farmers of this country
would never find an interelt in holding this
language and they had too much geÂ«erolity to
adopt it. From the nature of the landed in
tered, valuable as it certainly was and condi
tuting the balis of all riches, it could not be
pretended, that great sums could be drawn
from it for sudden emergencies. I f loans are
wanted, the merchants are able and willing to
lend, They cheerfully support a great (hare
of the public burdens and if we could not
(helterthein from deltruflion it was a weak
ness over which he (hould mourn in Silence but
which he wouid never think it politic topub-
Itm-fO the world.
Mr. S. Smith wilhedtohave rifenbefore r
the gentleman from Conne&icut (Mr.
Allen) to have expressed a firgla fentlmer.t,
with the hope that the que (lion might have
been taken without further debate ; butÂ«that
gentlcm-u had taken such a wide field of de ;
claniation and irritation, that he had loft all
hope of fpetdify takiaÂ» the qucllion. He
was of opiuion with the gentleman from 1
Pennfylvaniayellerday (Mr. Sitgreaves) that
this was a time in which they ought to a3,
and not to make speeches. The obferva ions
he wilhed to make was that we have alrea- 1
dy a Naval Establishment of three frigates 1
and two cutters, in the law for providing i
which, nothing is said to reilritl thrtr being 1
employed as convoy*. There Wus a cliulv
of this fort introduced into the bill; but the
Senate disagreed to it, fcnd this houfc con
curred in the amendment. It would be an
extraordi ary thing, iherefo.e, to prohibit
these twelve v fTcls from being employed as 1
convoys, wbilll the three frigates and two 1
cutters were Kable to be thus employed.

ADDRESS
To the Citizens of Massachusetts.
Citizens !
We are informed by the communications
of the enyoys extraordinary from the United
States to the republic of France, that they,
have been refufed an audience, and treated
with a niarked insolence and contempt by
the French direflcry. ,
Our eiituys haVe been told by the agents
â  of the French government, that we are a
divide4?people ; that they have here a party
so numerous and devoted to their mandates,
as to be competent, by the aid of diplomatic
intrigue, to overawe our constituted autho
rities, and didtate their mealureJ.
The dirediorv by their agents afFedt *2
confide r us as a colony to France, or as a !
pecpie tributary to her, and under her.con- ,
troul ; and they assume the right to levy
contributions upon our country, under the !
deceptive mafic of a voluntary loan. They
required offour envoys an advance of mpnqy,
equal to thirty three millions of Dollars, or
one hundred and seven tons of silver ; or in 1
other words, one hundred and seven -waggon
loads of dollars, carrying one ion or twenty j
hundred we gilt of dollars each ; fee the
estimate below, founded 011 M. Y's. written
propositions to the American envoys, con
firmed by other parts of their communica
tions.
This prodigious amount of money was to
be the price cf their being recognized as en
voys from the United States, or having the |
privilege of admission to the directory. Hav- j
ing paid, or agreed to pay, as far as they
could obligate the United States, this enor- ,
mous sum, as a preliminary point, they were
then to be allowed to state the objects of
their mission ; and would then only be in
rule toleainwhat further requifition3 cur
generous allies would please to impose upon
our country. And left' this insulting pro
polition should rouse the indignation of our
envoys, they were reminded, that iimilar
impefitions were laid upon all other nations
who were honored with the patronage of
France, or admitted to htr embraces, and to
deter them from rejecting the base requjfi
tion, the fate of Venice was pointedly Hat
ed to them, as the puni/hment referred for
our country, if they refufed to comply
That is ta fay, we might then expedt to be
conquered by France, to be divided inta dif- ]
tridts, and fold to other nations who would ]
bid highest j for such was the fate of
nice. j
But the free citizens of MafTachufetts, ]
indignant at the base insinuation of our be- ,
ing thas humiliated, and impelled no less by
their feelings than their duty, will declare to ,
the directory and the world, that they are 1
not a divided, nor a dependant people ; that J
they hold not their liberty under the patron- 1
age of France, nor are their conflicted au- ,
thorities dependant on her will, or their 1
measures fubjedt to her diiedtion. We are t
an Independent Nation, fubjedt to no laws, i
nor any government, but those of our own c
making ; aud it is hoped and believed, that
the citizens of Malfaehufetts, generally,
will afTure the President and Congress, by
manly and spirited addresses, as thq/ 1 - of ]
Boston have done, that they will support the c
meafu es, which the national government, q
in their wisdom, may deem necefTary, to
promote and secure the intcreft and happi
ness of our country.

From the Miidifex (Com-J Gazette*
t THERE exifls in this country a party or two
i And each has itt oHjefl, and each has its wiew.'
1 To the Jacobin party you know I belong,
. For, by nature, I uke the fide that is wronjr
, Against us are pitted the good, and the great'
The lave rs of order, the props of the state. '
These fellows intend to leave uj in the lurch
As sneaking as girls, when confefling at church -
Bat we will convince them we'll hold up our
noles. â¢
, Tho'the devil himfelf all our plotting difclof*s.
Our government', deem'd an Old Craft by'
these clubsâ ' '
They greafa up the axleâ<we split off the hubsâ
7bey whip up the cattle to drag it up hillâ
! We throw down chock under the
wheel-
This cart, we coritend, was most wretchedly
made, " '
That its ti-nbers already are sadly decay'd,
That it %/pokes are all luofe, broken down ate the
ruiwj.
And nothing is found but the tongue and the
naves.
And firtce it has (hewn such a pronenefs for
wearing, ,
Our club hat refolv'd, it is not worth repairing i
We ha ve therefore deter min'c| by one mighty lift,
To tumble ij over over, or fct it adrift.
The federahft's pbn ,s a ftrangecne, I own,
For when we fu crabbed,and factious are grown,
Fha fc neither their threats, nor their coaxing
can move* ,
The fcoimdre's will hire uj their mea/ures to love".
And no Jacobin ever a bribe could refill.
No, not if 'twere offcr'd by Pelzebub's lift.
Thus Mr.Eauchet.in, his flour-merchant trade,
Found Randolph hung back, when he wanted
his aid i
But yet, when the patriot told him his frier,
Ffinn the bargain, the Frenchman tlew off in
a trice,
Rcfol A! a while longer his dollars to keep,
Tiio' Edmund was willing to fell him dog-cheap.
The house, too, they view on the fame i'curvy
plan,
A kind ofexcrefceoce. likea mart on a man,
Like a wen on an ox, or a corn on the toes,
Or a carhnxcle hung to a dram drinker's nose.
They baSvn in the habit of borrowing as
much <
Ready rash as they could by the wÂ»yoftheDutel>,
But since poor Mynheer has become f<tns culotte,
He hasloii with his brcechesboth guijder&groat.;
While grandrramma Europe, flripp'd down to
the bone,
Much fonder of horrowing'than lending is grown;
And flill-fcarcer with us is that " root of alt evil,"
The widow of mammon and child of the devil:
So that nww it is obvious to eVery eye,
That the stream has dry'd up and the grift has
g neby.
Besides it w<ntanfwer to flrain over hard,
Left they tarry away all their fails by the yard,
iAnd give a chance, now and then,
to pop ki
An anchor of brandy or a barrel of gin ;
Hejiceitis these idrne fellows are ever contriving
Soaiejsian for preventing our calling from thriv
ing. â  L:
Since this creed we all hold, bo:h black, red and
white,
Â«To Ileal,from the public's a Jacobin's right."
Thus they tax our inolaffea to keep us from
cheating.
So 'tis plain they're refolv'd we ihall pay for
good eating.
Our fogarâowr fait, as if like Lot's wife,
They concluded us pickled for tlie reft of our life.
And ingettingtheircalb ihey've adamnable way,
' That isâ the molt easy for people to pay;
No w a tax that's diredl I advocate laying,
That each may enjoy the full plcallirÂ« of paying.
And give occupation to fberiffs a score,
Anu countr) colledlors a thoul'and or more.
Thus to grind down the poor to their own na
tive dirt,
And strip a poor fellow that has not a Ihirt.
At the opposite parly I'll just take a glance,
They were hatch's by Genet,whea he firft came
from France.
One rfei'er need look at a prettier let,
The fire, and the brats, are " hail teliows, well

I'hievct, bankrupts, and drunkards, pick-pock
ets, and all,
Well branded with brimftoue, and cropp'd at
the fall.
We do all is our power to perfua le the blind
people,
That Adams's legs are as long as a steeple,
That he flraddles about at a terrible rate,
Now over a puddle, now over a gate ;
While " toe u.an of the people" great Jefferfon,
pale,
Works along like a tad-pole,by wriggling bis tail.
These arHWrats, too, are an infoleut rate,
They won't e'en permit us to spit in their face ;
In Congress, behold a greit Lyoh appears,
From licland import ed, a iApurchas'd<withfleers;
A stream of mundungus not thinking of hurf,
He just took the licence on Grifn old to squirt
When lo 1 the fierce Yankee flew into a paflion,
And gave the bog-trotter a notable thtefning.

Adjourned unitil Monday evening next,
at seven o'clock.
According to adjournment, on Monday
evening, April 30th, 1793. u wards of
800 young citizens cf Philadelphia, &c.
aflembled ac the house of Mr. Cammeron,
Shippen-ftreet ; whereupon the committee

SAMUEL RELF, Chairman.
Edward Bridges, Sec'ry.
Bacbe's account of the meeting at Came
ron's is totally falfe. He knew it to be so,
and therefore it is that he adds the salvo of
not pledging himfelf " for his accuracy in
minute particulars." There was no dispo
sition shewn to buttle the person who moved
to strike the word wisdom from the resolu
tion ; arfd so far was lie from exprefling a
desire to state his reasons, that when called
upon to dÂ® so he refttfed. He was indeed
biffed, but the firft sentiment of indignation
soon gave way to a desire to preserve the or
def and decorum of the meeting. No vio
lence was offered to his person nor was there
any attempt made to injure him in the small
est degree. Whether this is a minute par
ticular, I shall leave it to the public to de
termine.
This contemptible foreign tool goes on to
fay t\at young men between eighteen and
twenty-one, ought to know that they art riot
entitled to the rights of citizens, and that
therefore it is improper in them to give in
ftruAions to the government. They are
fully sensible of this, and in the address,
which was unanim.-.ufly agreed to last night,
they declare that they " do not hold them
selves competent to form an opinion refpedl
ing the measures of the executive" but on
ly express their " coufidence in his wisdom,
integrity and patriotism" and their readiness
"at the call of their country to affembl?
with promjptitude, obey the orders of the
constituted authorities with alacrity, and on
every occasion aft with all the energy of
which they are capable." The young men
between the age of eighteen and twenty
one, are liable :o be called into atlual ser
vice ; there can be no impropriety in de
claring their determination i.ot to shrink
from the task in the eves of. any other than
an infamous mifereant who wishes the de
&ru&ion of his country in otdtr that France
may rife on the ruins of its greatness.
With refpcÂ£l to the-ftory about the huz
zaing of Mr Jeflerfon, if it has any truth,
it must have taken place afttr the business
of the meeting was doled. I was not then
present. However this is probably one of
the " minute particulars.'*
The meeting last night wa3 composed of
at least eight hundred perfens : the greatest
order, decorum and unanimity prevailed,
nor is theie one of the " half fledged men"
who i 9 not as much fuj erior to Baehe and
Callendet as honor is Â£up;rior to infamy.

On t ,Satiirday last anchored in this harbor
from Brest, three French 4+ gun Ihips, the of
ficers of which bring accounts that out com
miflioners at Paris were received, but treated
very indifferently ; one of them with whom I
was converting on that head, seemed to fignif-y
that they had nothing to fear from them, and
1 that thev would have to return without any
kind of fatisfaition : likewise that the least
particle of Engli(h manufacture in American
bottoms fubjeits vessels and cargoes to imme
' diate condemnation, and that all contrails
' made with them by the Americans are to be
paid punctually, but not a word refpefting
old debts. Good God ! It is aftonilhing to be
. eye witness to their unjust, illegal conduit to
wards the Americans ; there have been ten

which are capt. Crane, in the fchopner Yeat

here from Boston, w 110 has been so illy treated
j by government, that he is become quite de

J1 in this cafe, is truly neceilary â  when I reflect

j " Thatiks to the genius of liberty, we

â¢ are indebted for, to the perseverance of our
troops, who were never dispirited at the

- that evacuated it, and who amounted to

Genera! Deflaline. Their loss in killed, . '

YELLOW FEVER.
On the 14th of July, 1796, the Amer
ican prisoners at Algiers, with a considera
ble number of Neapolitans, who had been
' exchanged for Turks, left that city in the
fliip La Fortune, Capt. Calder, for Leg
horn.
| About two" hours after hoisting fail, one
of the Neapolitans was seized with the
plague, and, apprehensive the contagion
would spread among the crew, they put a
bout thi <hip, and stood for Algiers, in or
der ta land the Neapolitanâafter which
they proceeded on their voyage.
Next day another Neapolitan was discov
ered to have the plague, of which he died
1 fhortlv after ', and the fucceedirig day capt.
' Baily, one of the prisoners was fcitel wjtb
1 the fame difeefe, and also died.
The forecaftla was then converted into
an Hospital, and two Americans who had
had the plague in Algiers, were appointed
to attend them. Great precautions were
taken to prevent the disorder from spread
ing. The crew kept themselves in conllant
motion, thtir clothe? were aired, and the
decks kept cop.ftar.tly washed. By these
means its progress was effectually checked.
At this period they altered their courfa ;
and as they knew they would not be admit
ted into the port of Leghorn, they stood
for Marfeille3, where they were obliged to
ride quarantine eighty days.
