particulars:âthe public bring already ac- â¢
quaioted with the f.tuarion of our affair*, in 3.
France, it the time ef Mr. Gerry s depar
ture from that country, it is only jieceffary
to mention what ha, taken place fmce.

Seamen then in prifam, released from their

A few Hays after the failing of Mr. Cher
ry, a large number of New-York papers
reached Paris, by way of Bourdeaux, con- Tiic
taining a great number of addresses UVthc arrive
Prtfident of the United States, with sundry (
ail sand debates of Congress, which bespoke p er i e n
so much union of the people, wisdom and u |^ t i[
firmnefs of the government, that the long happy
entertained hope of separating a free and
happy people from the gonMnment of its 70
own deliberate choice, was then given up. <
About this time Doctor Logan, of Phila-' T
delphia, arrived in Paris, by the way of v j(j tc
Hamburgh, who found his way dire Sly to y our
fame of the Membtrs of the it po{ , r
appears by hiÂ» memorial, that he conni'med I
what had but jiiti began to be believed, that w j lo
France had now but very few friends left in we |j
America. A few days produced the release j tHC |
of the American fhipphg and seamen, with
ail order to all the forts in the Republic to tQ j f
treat all Americans well that might arrive
there ; these meafares were communicated 1 m(;jr
to Mr. Skipwith. our Consul General in
Paris, reqneflirig t(iat they might be com- t
municated to the government of the United I an j
States, as focn as possible, and at his re- â¢
(jueft, a letter of fafe condtift or proteftion {a ? n
was granted for the brig Cyrus,'to carry
dispatches for the Secretary of State, of the j t h
United State 3. 1
Â£We h >pe the above will convince the few I I
yet doubting Americans of the neceflity by 1
of national defence. A government will i 3 ir
nevttr have ic in its power to preserve oefs
peace with honor, until it has in its power ; n fli
to carry on -war with vigor.âWe warn j and
our readers, however, not to trull to the (ho'
tears of the Crocodile ; from dearcxpe- thii
rience we have learnt that the French are I f or
not to be believed ; we well know that I (hil
their promises and their pitcrufl are alike 1 not
made to be broken ; and that the mod I '
fr.lemn oaths of a nation, which has ab- 1 m e
j.ired its God, mull ntceffarily be compo- to
fed of more flimfy ft off, " than dreams are j arc
made of" If the directory are fmcere in Iyo
their advances towards a reconciliation, j by
let them evince it by immediately indem- I m |
nifying our merchants for the depredati- I 0 u
onsofthofe pirates, whom they have I p P:
commifiioned, and with whom they have 1 th<
(hared the booty. Let them also apolo- tre
gife for their infolenee in reje&ing our 1 f t{
ambaffador6. Let them do this, and we |
will then fiy, that the present govern- ha
ment of France, amid the multitude of I p r
its crimes, has performed ONE jufl and c 0
honorable aSion. Yet even this one, like I
/.of in Sodom, will not be able to save I
them from deftruftion. Otli-.r nations will J "
revenge, though We should forgive ; and >
we are assured by a very rtfpcdtable cha- V
rafter, who has lately traveled through I
the interior of France, that two thirds I
even of the French themselves are in fa-1

their liability in such fta'e to receive damage by f
wet, or by sudden and haft y removal, or to be fio- r

proportioned accordingly.

of the premium is essential tÂ« such renewal ; and
if the party itifured fuffers any time to elapse after

TO BE LEASED FOR A TERM OF YEARS.
I e
â¢d TO be leafed, for a term not less than three,
f . JL nor ntore than sewn years, a VALUABLE '
)e PROPERTY as the Seneca-Falls, in the county of 1
in j Onondlgo,t nd'ftate of New-Vork, on the Banks '
r _ los the Seneca-river, two miles weft; of the Cayaga- ,
w ' ferry, and eleven miles east of Gtneva.
This eftablilftment confifls of an excellent grift
ie mill, saw mill, dwelling house, barÂ«, and a port.
3 f sage or carrying place, with between thirty and
5 . forty acre* of land, under good improvement, and
as nioch more in the vicinity, as may be required f
for future improyement. t
It The grift mill is'a handsome, new and jvell fin r
ffhed building, of so by .to feet, 3 stories high
j. ana lurnilhed with a run of excellent Burr stones
and another of ETopus' stones, of the bell quality q
.. âand the mod approved bftalts, &e. calculated to f
1> ,makÂ« all the different qualities of flour for expor
i_ tation or sos home confnmption : It is acceQible by
water from every part of the Cayuga lake ani Se
neci-river, as well as from the Seneca-lakeâand C
from its iituation, commands a veryextenfive and
encreafing cultoin : The dream on which it stands, !
. ' being the outlet of the Seneca-lake, the mill cau a
e | ncvarbe in want of water ; and a it has been kept
i_ workingduring the severest season of the laltwin- [(
(e :er, it is not liable to be impeded by froft :
.. The saw millis also new, fituatefc on the fame p
ftreÂ«m, now furililhed with an ample stock of
T logs, of which a supply may at all times be pro-
cured by ian4 or water, of the bed quality :
n The dwelling house is well calculated for the tffe
y ; of the miller, is netv, and fufficiently laige : Tbc
;i ; barn is about 40 feet square, and entirely uew :
j. | The portage is j-4thsof a mile in length, along J
[ the Seneca-fallsâover which were pa ATM in the |)(
[ ) last year, nearly two hundred boats with their - n|
1 contents ; this objedl is already "produdtiva of a
! liandfome income, which must be iiicreafing and r
II j permanent:
j Among the many advantages of this situation,
s must be numbered the'fertility of the furi-ounding
. j country âbeing the bÂ»ft improved part of the coun
[j ty of Onondagaâthe concentration of inter
e 1 course by land and water, the Genel&e llateroad
I palling through it, as well as all water Carriage to
I Geneva, and the counties of Ontario and Steuben ; .
e I which renders it a mod eligible stand for a Store or
T TavernâThe river and lakes abound in filh and
' fowl, and the country with deer and other game.
i Belides the mills already ereiSed at this place, it a
r , is calculated for any additional water works that 15
. may be found necessaryâFulling mill, baik mill P l
: tannery, forges &c. may be at a small ex- ,
" i penceâlron ore may be brought in boats Irom the
' Cayuga lake ; and it is theught to abound in the trl
