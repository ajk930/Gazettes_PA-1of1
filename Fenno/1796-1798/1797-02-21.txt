THE WARNING No. 111.
THE Paris accounts inform us, that France has
lately exeicifed towards Genoa an a& of atrocious
opprefTtoit, which is ari additional and a finking in
dication of the domineering and predatory spirit by
which (he is governed. This little republic, whose
tertitory icarcvly extends beyond the walls of her
metropolis, has been compelled, it seems, to ransom
herfe'f from the talons of France by a contributi
on of nearly a million of dollars ; a large fun, for
her caritia&ed resources. For this boon, " the
French government engages on its part to renounce
all claims upon Genoa, to forget what has palled du
ring the prefeut war, and to forbear any future de
mands. ' It would appear from this, that Fiance
I to colottr the odious exaction, belidcs ihe pretence
I of mifcondufl towards her in 'V.e prefenf has
not difibined :o resort to the dale and pitiful cevice
of reviving some antiquated claim upon tiie country
itfelf. In vain, did the signal hazards encountered
by Genoa to preserve her neutrality, in defiance of
the host of enemjes originally leagued against France
âin vain did the chara&er and title of repubK;
plead for a mote generous treatment : the attrafti
onsof plunder predominated. The spirit of lapine,
callous to the touch of juftiee, blind to the evidence
of truth, deaf to the voice of entreaty, mark
ed out and de'-oted the vi&im. There -was no al
ternative but-to compound Â«r perish.
If it be even fuppofcj, though this has neverap
peared, that at some period of thi war, Genoa may
be chargeable with aÂ£ts of questionable propriety
in relation to France, it is manifeft, that it ought to
be attributed to the neceflity of a situation which
must have obliged her to temporizeâa very small
aÂ«d feeble slate, in the midst of so many great con
, fliQing powers, parts of her territories occupied by
armies, which she was unable to oppose ; it were a mi
j racle, indeed, if her cowduft in every parti, ular will
â  bear the test of rigorous scrutiny. Bwt if at any
i time the of circumstances may have occa
; fioned some flight deviation, there is nevertheless
full evidence of a cbnftant folieitude on the p-irt of
Genca to maintain, to the utmofl of her ability, a
i sincere neutrality. It is impofllble to forget the
: glorious stand, which she at one time made ngninft
the imperious efforts of Great-Britain to her
from htt neutial position. The magnanimous'and
exemplary fortitude, which (he displayed or ttat
occasion, excited in this countryuniverf.il admirati
on, ar.d must have made a ceep imprefiion. 'Tis'
only to recollect that instance to be fatisfied, that
the treatment which she has just experienced from
France merits the indignant execration Â»f tm.ikiiid.
Unfortunate Genoa 1 how little didst thou imagine,
that thou wert destined so soon to be compei'ed to
purchafiÂ£ thy fafety from ihe crushing weight of
that hand which ought to have been the firft lo rife
in thy defence !
How fruitful at the fame time of inftruftion to
us is th's painful example ! The molt infatuated par
tisans of France cannot but fee in it an unequivocal
proof of the rapacious and v[j> liftive policy which
diflates her measure*. All men must fee in it, that
she flagrant injuries which we are now fuffeiing
from her, proceed trom Â« general plan of domina
tion and plunder ; from a difpolition to prostrate
nations at her feet ; to trample upon their necks ;
to ravish from them whatever heiÂ» avidity or conve
nience may think fit to dedicate tÂ» her nwa-ufe.
The lad intelligent# from France seems to dispel
the deubt whether the depredations in the Weft-In
dies may Hot have resulted from misapprehension or
abuse of vhe orders of the French government. It
is now understood to be a fafl, that the cruifets of
France every where are authorised to capture and
bring in all veflels bound lo the ports ef her ene
mies.
This plan is pregnant with the worst evils, which
are to be dreaded from thef declared and unqualified
hostility of any foreign power. If- France, after
being properly called upon to renounce it, (hall per
fsvere in the measure, there cannot he a question but
that open war will be preferable to such a stale By
whatever name, treachery or pusillanimity may at
â¢ tempt to diiguife it, 'tis ia fadfc war, war of the
woift kind, war on one sidb. If we can be in
duced to submit to it longer than is necessary to as
certain that it cannot be averted by negotiation, we
are undone a people. Whether our {[eterminati
on (hall be to lock up our trade by embargoes, or to
permit out commerce to continue to float an unpro
tfÂ£led prey to French cruisers, our degradation and
ruin will be equally complete. The deftruftion ps
our navigation and commerre, the annihilation of
our mercantile capital, the difptifion aÂ«d loss of our
feaitKn obliged to emigrate for fubfiflence, the ex
tindtion of our revenue, the fall of public credit,
the ua f ;nationof every species of induflrry, the ge
neral impoverifliment of our citizens, these will be
minor evils in the dreadful catalogue. Some year?
of security and exertion might repair them. But
the humiliation of the American mind would be a
lasting and a mortal disease in our social habit.
Mental debasement is 'he greatest misfortune that
can befal a people. The mo't pernicious of con
quests which a state can experience is a conquefi over
that just and elevated sense of its own rights which
inspires a due sensibility to insult and ihjury, over
that virtuous and generous pride of character, which
prefeis any peril or facrifice to a final fubmifSoÃ to
â  opprcflion, and which regardi national igncminy as
the greatelt Â»f national calamities.
The lecords of history contain numerous proofs
ef this truth. But an appeal to them is unnecelTi
ry. Holland and Italy present to our immediate
r observation examples as decisive as they are deplora
ble. The former within the laii ten years has un
dergone two devolutions by the intervention of fo
reign powers without evÂ«B a fcrious ftmgglc. Muti
lated of precious portions of its territory at home
by pretended benefaflors but real difpoilers, its do
minions abroad (line into the pofleflion of its enemies
| mies rather as dereli&s than as she acqmfitions of
victory. Its fleets surrender without a blow. Im
portant only by the spoils which it offers no less to
its friends than to its enemiesâevery symptom in
its affairs is portentous of national annihilation.
' With regard to Italy, 'tis fafficitnt to fay, that
1 (he is debased enough not even to dare to take part
iu a conleft, on whieh, at this moment, her deltiny
is fofpended.
Modeiation in eveiy nation is a virtue. In weak
or young nations, it is often wife to take every
i chance by patience and address to divert hostility,
i and in this view to bold parley vith infalt and tn
' j ur yâhut to capitulate with oppression, or rather to
' fm render to it at difcretien, is in any nation, that
r has any power of refinance at all times, as foolifh
r as it is contemptible.. The honor of a nation is its
i *ife. Deliberately to abandon it is to commit an
- aft of political suicide. Theie is treason in the fen
r timent, avowed in the language of some, and be
: trayrd by the conduct of others, that we ought tÂ»

CONGRESS or tub UNITED S7ATES
HOUSh OF RKPRESfcNTATIVtfi,
Thursday, January 19.
The House being in a committee of the whole on
the fubjed of further revenue, Mr. Dent in the
chair.
Mr. Hartley hÂ»ped the am-ndment of the gen.
tleman from Connedicur, would not prevail. He
did not fee that there was a profped of f u f~
ficient revenue from impost duties, and they mtift
therefore, have recourse to dired taxes. The only
question was whether thelaft ceufus should be made
use of, or a new one taken ; he thought there w?Â»
no neeeffity for a new one. He was convinced, he
said, that a land tax was neceflary ; he would vote
for it, and pay his portion of it. He hoped, finee
they mud meet the question, that they might do it
fooa, and not consume mora time in debate.
Mr. Dayton (the speaker) said that the words
" according to the lajl census," which were proposed
to be stricken out, appeared to him objedionable
in every point of view. If they implied that the
enumeration made several years ago, (hould be the
rule of apportionment even though a new one
(hould be taken before the dired taxes were appor
tioned, or, what seemed more probable, if it was
intended in this mdiredt and covert way, to decide
that no new census should be ordered with a view to
a more equal apportionment of the burthens, there
wastn either cafe a glaring impropriety in retaining
and thu9 conneftyio them with the principle itfÂ«ir.
The important qneltion ef dired taxes ought to
have been pr. fen ted ta the deliberation of the com
mittee of the whole, in terms the most general and
abltrad, dripped of every modification not necessa
rily conneded wi-h it, instead of whi.h, there was
blended in the fame sentence, and they were to de
cide in the fame breath, another question equally,
nay to some Hates more, important than the firit.
Whethe- they were tÂ» take the relative numbers in
1790 or thole in 1797 as the guide in laying the
tax upon each liate, ought to undergo a full and
separate consideration, and not by feeing -wrapped
up as it Was in the other proportion, pass as the
sense of the house without any difcuflion.
Mr. Daytoo said he (hould be fatisfied with (bik
ing out thole words, and inserting no other, but if
any other were to be introduced he should prefer
those in the conditution, viz. " according to their
refpeftive utimieri." He was free to acknowledge
that he fttould not vote for the proposition, even if
the amendment, which he advocated, was carried,
for he could never conf#nt to resort to dired taxes
upon lands and hcufes, until the less exceptionable,
less unequal, and less opprefiive means of raising
revenue by indued taxes were exhausted. If how
erer, a majority should think different from him,
and carry the resolution for the adoption of a system
of dired taxation, ke should think it his duty to
move for a new census to be taken previVnfly to
the apportionment. This ought not ta he rtfufed, if
to equalize the public burthens was an objciS just
and defirabie. for if the lait enumeration of inhab
itants was to be adopted as the rule, every member
upon that ft <>r mult be fendble that New-Jersey
mult be rated an J taxed very far above her just
proportion, and that a farmer in Lis date mult con
tribute at lead fifty per cent, more than a farmer of
the fame polTeffions and property in either of the
adjoining dates. Sttcb, Mr. Dayfon said, had been
the Cffinfe of emigration, and such the Ihifting of
population from one state to another, that a census
taken seven years ago, would furnilh a very falfe
edimate of the prefientdate of wealth and popula
tion. WhiJll emigrations had been gointj on for
years pall from New Jeifey in all dircAinns, many
of the other dates had received valf accefliotts of
numbers, which ought to be ascertained by a new
enumeration, before they commenced their as yet
unexerciled power of dired taxation which profclies
to found its apportionment upon numbers only.
He did not at all concnr with the gentleman frot#
Virginia, who had said that the apportionment of
representatives mud neceffatily precede the appor
tior;ment of taxes under every new ienfus, for they
might fay with as much propriety that the repre
sentation under the new fhnuld not appropriate mon
ies raised under the old apportionment.
Mr. Swift said he did not thi,*k the prelent a
debate about words;~arrd hot cifTlTUrtance, as it had
been aflerted. His intention was to introduce the
vvofds " according to their numbers," instead of
" acco: ding to the lad census." He did not wi(h
the House to decide that the apportionment (honld
be made agreeably tÂ» the lad cei.fus. He wilhed
to leave the refolutien open in that refpefl. If his
amendment took place, it would nnt preclude the
use of the lad census ; but if the resolution pafled in
its present form, it excluded all idea of a i.ew ceu
fus. He, therefore, thought the amendment im
portant, and he was sorry to hear gentlemen charge
him with improper motives in bringing it forward.
Mr. Swift referred to the words of the conftitu
tioa, relative to the taking of a census, and laying
dired taxes. From these word?, he said, Reprtfen
tation and Taxation mud go together, and that a
census could not betaken for the purpose of the
latter, without having effect upon the former also.
Admitting that a census could not be taken for the
purpose of a dired tax, it could be taken for both
purposes ; and he would much rather it ftioutd be
so taken, than that the tax ihould belaid according
to the lait census. Nor did he think this would
occasion much delay. It would appear, bt* laid,
as if fothe gentl.-rntn thought that a dired tax
could be collected as soon as determined upon.
This could not be. They mud pass a general law,
direding the principle of valuation to be adopted.
The butinefs could not be accsmplifhed before the
next session, however great the want cf money
might be j and the mode he proposed would
the bulinefs as soon as if the apportionment, was a'
this time made. He thought this a fufficient rca
fon for wilhipg his amendment to pass. No g' l1 *
.tleman had said, that it would be either fair or hon
ed, to make an apportionment aceoiding to the
present census. The date which he reprefw'.
when compared with the date of New-York, vouid
be greatly injured ; and ought they not, he
to have recourse xr> fume mcsfure, hv which.- o
prevent this injury ! He thmiglrf they ought.
thi9 amendment was adopted, and a new ceoluiaoieed upon, lie Tiad before said, It would he in to
their power to colled a tax as form as if the present nc
eenfuswas made use of. Why then, be aftright- gi
ed with difficulties ? Some gentlemen thought it th
impossible to obtain a cotreft census ; othets ftip- of
posed, that if it were taken for the purpose of asses- b<
sing a tax, it would not be more numerous than the in
last ; but be believed it was in tbe power of go- c;
Ternmtnt, to make laws equal to the equitable ap- d:
. portionment of the tax. But if a new census was h
not taken, Gonne&icut would pay 40,000 dollars a
more than Hie ought to do, and this sum would be If
paid to the state of New York, fmce that state t!
would pay so much less than its just proportion, ti
Would the people of Gonnefticut, who were now w
paying large funis for the interell of t debt which g
that state refufed or negle&ed to pay, be fatisfied b
with this ? He believed they would not. If indeed, t,
they meant to fatisfy the people of the United States J
in this business, they mult apportion tbe tax fairly j,
and equally, which could not be done by the pref t
ent ceofus. i
Mr. N. Smith said he (bould vote against thte a
mendment proposed by his colleague ; not because
'he approved of an apportionment being made accor- Â£
tb tUe present census, but because the amend- s
me-it would have ns tffe<3. The lefolution, he
said, after it wasfo amended, would Hand upon the j
fame ground as at present. To fay, " that th" tax (
(hould be apportioned according to numbers," was .
the fame thing at faying, "it should be apportion- j
ed according to tbe la(l census," as theonly way of .
di termining the numbers was by the last census.
The thing would, therefore, be the fame,' and they |
certainly ought not to vote to amend without some ,
meaning. 1
The resolution before them, he said, contempla
ted the apportionment of a tax the present fefiaoii: j
and if it pa/Ted, the tax mud be appropriated this
feffien, or not at all, and it must be according to .
the last census.
He agreed with that gentleman, that it would be
just that an enumeration (hould take place before
th-- ux ; but he believed, this could
not be effected by the amendment propoled. He
thought there was no other way of etfe&ing this,
than by difpoGng of the present resolution, and
by bringing in another. He agreed with that
gentleman, that a valuation and census might be
provided for ?t the fame time, and he believed it
would occasion 110 delay in the collection ; but if
this was the gentleman's idea, the present resolu
tion could not answer the purpose, under aÃy mo
dification.
Mr. W. Smith was glad to find the gentleman
from Conne&icut had been explicit in declaring it
to be his intention to have a new census taken. He
was rather surprised to hear that declaiation after
what he had said at the time he introduced his mo
tion ; as he then told them, that he was opposed to
the tax,>but that our necefiities had convinced him
of the propriety Â«f going into it ; yet he now pro
posed to delay the business till next vtar, and furth
t. er, to relieve our necessities, he prnpofed an expence
of J O,OOO dollars in taking a new census.
Mr. S. thought this was the tims for trying this
qtiellion, whether the tax /hould be appoitioned j
according o the old or a aÂ«w census : bccaHfe t:
gtnlemen were determined to vote adiieft
i<tx, except a new census was taken, it would be
â well to have that know:-. Nor ciÂ»Â«lld the committee
of Ways and Means proceed with the bntinofs, un
til they knew whether the apportionment was to
be made upon the present census, or a new one must
be taken. To bring in a bill upon -fuel) uncertainty
would be doing nothing. It would be better that
t'.e qutftieo ttiould now be decided. He wished it
-might be understood that if a decision took plare
oitlhe resolution as reported, the old census would
be acted upon ; but if the proposed amendment w*s
agreed to, that a new one must be taken. If the |
latter (hould be the cafe, he (hould confide! the bu
iinefsas totally defeated, a*d think it necelfary im
mediately to go upon a system of incircft taxation.
He hoped therefore a decision would be taken.
"It would be remembered Mr. S. said, that the
law for taking r'ne last census palfcd in 1790, that
in 179' an amendment was found necelfary, and
the census was not received till 1 792. If so long a
time was now to be taken before the tax proposed
could be .carried into effect, (which was probable
would be the cafe, if a new census was determined
upon) eveiy gentleman must be convinced it would
not answer the purpose intended.
Mr. Baldwin hoped it would be recolle&ed that
"this queftinn would occur every year. If a land
tax is adopted as one of tbe permanent sources of
revenue to ftipply the rreafury, it might be dated
every year, that there had been large removals from
one state into another, extending in some cases to
Â«fn or twenty thousand inhabitants, and that there
fore a census mutt: be taken every year to make the
tax equal. He thought the only question now
_proper!y bnfore them was, wheiher the demands on
the government were not now so great that the
countty must be publicly disgraced and their credit
proftr 'ted by not fulfilling its engagements, tinlefs
further revenues are provided, and that adequate
revenues cannot be provided without refortirig to
a land tax. If the present state of our affairs fotce
M to such a tax, the conft.ittition requires it (hould
be according to the lad census. In laying the tax
it may be a good reason to urge that the land tax
/hould be as final! as possible till another census can
betaken, and also te urge taking measures to ob
tain a new cenlus. As soon as a new census is ta
ken, the tax, no doubt, in some inltauces, will be
rnoreequd, but these inequalities must take place
between the different periods of taking the census;
he thought it not a fufficient reason for putting off
the question for two or three years, which mud be
its tffe<Sl.
Mr. Nicholas hoped, fine* the question had been
stirred, it would be decided upon. It was not a
principle upon which they wete at liberty to Â«r
rot- It appeared to him that the gentleman from
New Jeifey, (Mr. Dayton) was perfectly mistaken.
If they were now to apportion a direct tax, they
must determine it according to num'-ers ; it was a
decision they could not avoid. And notwithfland
ing th >t Â»eiitleman had flattered himfelf, that he
bad difcovcred an intention of doing wrong toother
pai.aui ilu Union, he believed it would be found
Â«
to have arisen m*re from thst gentleman's willing- *5
nefsto have found him in that situation, "thai; any
ground he had for the charge. It was his opinion
that a census mud be taken, for the double purpose
of reprefentatien and taxation, and that it could not
be taken fur the purpose of a tax, without extend- S C J
ing to the feprefentation also. Therefore, if a new
csnfus was made, it would be five years before a
dircft tax could be laid ; for the different dates
having elected their members upon the old census, Scl
a sew Â«ne could not be acted upon until a new e
lefiion took plaee ; it would be three years before SI"
the new legislature would meet; and it would be
two years afterwards before the aft tor a direct tax
would be completely in effeift ; unlets, indeed, the
1 gentlemanfrom Connefticutt thought a census could r iv
I be taken for taxation only, which "nuft have been .
1 the opinion of the gentleman from New Jeifey a o. Ith
I Mr. N. said he knew it was impossible to do equal
' judice to every part of the Union in a bufineis o 25
this kind. All they could do was te come as near to
it aÂ« possible. , . '
Mr. Williams said, this was one of tbe difficulties fei
; which must have been i'orefeen to attend a iyttem
' of direst taxation. He hoped the amendment *
* would not prevail. It wan true, he said, there had pa
e been great emigration into the state of New- or >~ a
c but the emigrants were mostly gone into the wil- pa
4 dernefs, and could not be expeflcd to bear a part in
8 any tax which might be laid on that date. ror
- his own part, he believed, if the amendment was Mh
,f agreed to, it would defeat the whole bufinefjs ; and pt
'â¢ thou"h he did not wiffi immediately to go into a bi
y system of direst taxation (except indeed the plan
e should be such as he wholly approved) he had a desire
to fee it organized. He (till wiflied they had hrft C
l " gone into the bufinef# of appropriation, before they bT
had been called upon to vote on this question. ar
