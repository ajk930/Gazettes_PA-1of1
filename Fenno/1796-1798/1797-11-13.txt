RfiLALIVE TO THt. CONSPIRACY.
Declaration of Duvefne Depreffe, or Du
nant, annexed to the secret register of the
Direftory, n Ventofe, sth year.
( Concluded fram Thursday's Gaz.)
" CITIZENS,
"In order to attain tKe obje& propnfed,,
the commandant circles {hall en
deavour to difc;n er the charafter and opinÂ»v
ions of every individual in their, canton,
which is an easy matter. The revolution
has pronounced in tin departments-the chi
rafter of every individual in Rich a manner
that" every man might boldly judge of the
character of his neighbour.
" They {hall chufc the mod courageous
royalists, and form them into companies ;
the quantity and number of whicli (hould be
proportioned to the pecuniary means which
the agents (hould be able to dedicate to that
service. They {hall furnilh them wiih arms
and ammunition.
" The companies (hall always be ready to.
assemble, especially during the fitting of the
primary assemblies. At this epoch their obÂ»
jeÂ£t (hall be to check every party, armed or
not armed, which (hould attempt to opppfe
the freedom ofekftion ; it being always un
derstood that they (hall never take up arms
firft, and never (how themselves but under
republican colours. They (hall hava, be
sides, another objeft in view, that of forejng
by threats or otherwise, thetnembers of the
philanthropic institution to attend the pri
mary assemblies.
" The latter and their other agents {hall
endeavour to gain over the leaders of differ
ent corps, or even whole corps, and these
(hall remain with their ftandarda, or encou
rage and facilitate desertion. They (hall
keep the diferteis in the country, under pre
text of employing them in the labours of ag
riculture, and enrol them only as occasion
do lt etJ,
requires,
" In the provinces where infurreftions
have exilted, the commandants (hall spare
no pains to preserve and to augment the spi
rit of royalifm. They (hall prepare the pea
sants for a new infurre&ion, but they (hall
not excite any commotion, but in conse
quence of formal orders of superior agents.
" If it (hould happen that the fuccefi of
the military preparations (hould be such as
to permit a reafjpnable hope that an imme
diate qwrthrow of the government might be
effe&ed, then the mode of proceeding thro'
the medium of the primary aflemblies (liall
be abandoned, and the favourable moment
(hall be ftized to arrive diredtly at the object
propofedthe pureand simple re-eftablifhnynt
of monarchy. It belongs to the agents to
judge in what cireumftance it may be ad
visable. In a word, after the agents at Paris
(hall deem it certain that the king mult spee
dily be proclaimed either in confequonce of
the measures to be taken by the councils, in
which there was to be a majority of his
partizans, or by mea;i9of military force,they
(hould instantly fend a fteadj' royalist, in or r
der to give him intimation, and to bring a
pWnce of the blood, and that as soon as pof
fiblÂ« the royalists (hould hare a chief who
(hould filtnce all jealousy and private ambi
tion.
Â« In order to prepare and devolve this
plan, funds must be neceflary, and these
could be furnifhed by England alone.
" M. de Precy, for the use of the agents
with which he is entrusted, is authorized to
draw upon M. Wickham, the English minis
ter in Switzerland, for the funds which he
should judge neceflary, with the approbation
of M. Wickham.
" And I myfelf obtained
60,c001. fter. forÂ«<air preparatory expences.
We had the afluraiice of a sum of 30,0001.
sterling, which was to have been paid to me
the month that the King's proclamation
should be ifiiied, on condition that we (hould
not begin to aft before the eleftions; â
15,0001. sterling for the purchale ps white
uniforms, in order to furnifh the arefs of
-certain corps, payable when a bargain offer
ed at the fame time when the king's procla
mation should be issued.
J " In a word, through our hinds were to
be tranfmittrd funds, the amount of which
wds not yet afcertairied, in order to be con
veyed to M. M. de Puifaye and de Frotte,
whose situation demands expenses more con
siderable than that of our other diftri&s.
" Although the plan was only definitively
adopted very lately, although no part of the
funds which I obtained, had yet arrived, we>
must not conclude, however, that this was n
mere sketch. All the ancient elements were
colle&ed, and our position was as follows :
" M. de Puifaye, who, already in a situa
tion alone to effeft a counter revolution, was
anxious to declare himfelf. We had hither
to prevented him. He has since extended
his eorrefpondence from Brest, as far as La
velle. I believe he reckons upon several
corps employed in that quarter.
" M. de Frotte was still in London at the
period of my departure. But he calculated
upon proceeding immediately to Normandy,
where he had left the officers who had for
merly served under his command. From the
letters it would appear that,the difpofitiors
of the country were extremely favour
able. They demanded the return or their
chief. They prefled him eartieftly ; for
the royalists, who were certain of our
Canton, conceive that they have only to de
clare themselves, and the counter revolution
will be effected. M. de Frotte is pofleffed
of judgment and talentsâhe is one of our
belt chiefs.
Check Clerk,
duo.
" M. d'e Rochecot, who isentrufted with
the talk ofpreparing Le Maine, LÂ« Perche,
and Le Pays Chartrain, was lately at Paris.
He is a young man, very a&ive, and very in
telligent. His military organization consists
only of a few hundred men, but this limi
tationis only hecaufe there were not fufiicient
funds to engage more. He allured us that
in his part of the Â«ountry every body pro

ceeded beyond the philanthropic inditution,
in order to become member? of the faithful.
M. de Rochecot fpakeof the correspondence
which he had with the corps stationed
throughout Le Maine. He had some even
ajt Caen. [There arc fame things relative to
him, rv/jich lam unwilling to mention, except
verbally.']
" M. de Bourmont has just begun hisope
rations from L'Orient as far as Paris. âln
this party there are a great many philan
thropes. The royalists arc more rare.
" M. Mallet, formerly adjutant major of
the Chateau Vieux, was entrusted with the
department of Upper Normandy, and the
Ide of France to Paris, for all our diftri&s
for 50 leagues round form a triangle, of
which one angle reds apon Paris. It is
completely organized, and will have a plenty
of men, provided there be money enough.
It is 111 the belt state of preparation for the
elections.
" In the Orleannois one M. de Juglat is
employed. Ido not know the situation in
which he stands. I believe, hwwever, he has
.made considerable progress.
" The coast of Picardy, that of Sennonias
and La Brie, are (till destitute of chiefs, and
of consequence without organization. We
expe&ed a M. Buttes, who is announced to
us as-pofifcffing exteniive connexions in the
firft of the'e provinces.
" We dire&ed our attention to the objeft
of renewing our correspondence in La Ven
dee. We are afTured of success at Haut
Poiton. A chevalier de Paller Duparc
our organization. He as
serts that he has correspondence even at
Rochefort. The duke de Longe was im
mediately to repair to Bourdeaux from Eng
land, in order to organize that country un
der our direftion.
" At Paris irhere are two companies form
ed. One of them I believe it under the
command of M. de Trenville ; I dost knÂ«w
the commandant Â«f the other. â¢ Paris, as
you may ealily imagine, is the focus of our
communications. Hitherto we had not at
tempted agy corruption by money. We
fhocld now haÂ»e attempted it, in oÂ»der to
proCiirt'dccurate information of the funds of
government I have told you that I had in
my bands the plan of a dejeent upon Ireland,
or rather the report of Carnal relativt to that
plan, I know Very quell how it was procured,
but not by whom.âThis, however, I could
easily learn.
" We confidcr it as of very great, impor
tance to gain the police. We had mad made
very little progress in this objeft, but you
know that we had already made the firft ad
vances. Every week we received extracts
from the report of the commiflioners of the
executive power upon the state of opinion
in the departments.
" I know not from whence tke opinion
arose, th3t the minister of police not
be ill-disposed to serve us ; probably because
he was considered as moderate, and i 6 inces
santly the objeA ef the hostility of the Jaco
bins.
" We entertained the fame fentimeirts of
the minister of the interior, probably for the
fame reafom.
" But it is the councils where we met
with most encouragement. Since the month
of June lad propofalnvere made to us in the
name of a party which stated itfelf to be very
powerful. We traufmitted them to the
king. Tliey offered to afiill his canfe pro
vided there was no other change in the ex
illing constitution than the concentration of
the executive power in his person. The king
accepted the service, but offered to discuss
the condition. He acaordiiigly desired that
a person Ihould be sent to him prop#rly au
thorized. Since that period he has continued
to urge this demand ; but the party being
much'more feeble than they had teprefented,
has relaxed in its pretentions without re
nouncing them entirely. On our fide,
thinking to be able to restore the throne
through the assistance of the two councils,
we were of opinion that they Ihould remain
matters with regard to the terms to be im
pofecj upon the king, and we did not urge
the mffiion. About two months ago a
person set out, who, I believe, carried with
him a lift of the members who are desirous
of monarchy, the nnmberof which amounts
to 184. Upon this point I will not affirm
with confidence. The evening, or the even
ing befor< our arrest, a person had come
to propose to Jjive the king a lift of lixty
members more. He pledged himfelf to ob
tain a declaretiot! fromthe son of the duke
of Orleans, that he did not, nor ever would
pretend to the -throne. He engaged, be
sides to fend the young prince to the king,
but a number of conditions were required.
You will perceive that we had lifteued atten
tively to every proposition, that we made
ample promises, without incurring however 1
any obligations.
" The importance of which it might be
to our cause, to gain the corps connected
with the different services at Paris, render
this a principal objeft of our attention. We
had some success in our quarter, and we
were naturally led to expeft still greater
progress, since it was in consequence of the
steps taken in order to realize this hope that
we were arretted. Several of our agents
were employed in founding particular admi
nistrations. One.of them even has told me
that ten presidents of municipal administra
tions were gained over, but it would be Im-'
propcrto rely too much oq this observation.
The rOyali.ls have always deceived them
selves with regard to the number of their
partisans.
" You are aware that we have paid for
more than one pamphlet; that we hate given
articles for insertion in more than one Jour
nal, and mortf than once given money to
certain Journalists.
" If the reports of a great number of
these papers arc to be credited, and the
notes which we procured from the police,
we had a great advantage of exprtflion tin
our favor : you cannot doubt that with the
money which we were about to receive, that
we should have been able greatly to extend
and dtvelope cur means. 1 here confine the
ehumeration ; I ltiay have forgot some of
them ; other fadts there are to which I will
only speak verbally.
" The agency of M. de Precy is in a
very different situation from ours.âHither
to his preparations have not been much di
rected to military affairs, and it is only very
latdy that he has adopted our political
measures, He is at pfefent at Berne, where
he very regularly receives the accounts trans
mitted to him by particular agents ; he had
conneftions through the whole of the
South. Last vea l , - lieju.d great difficulty
in restraining the ardour of a party among
them, who were very desirous of an infui
refiion. It at Lyons where he has most
partizans. His great objeft is to secure
some strong town, in order to facilitate the
entrance of the army of Conde into France.
I am certain there is a â correspondence with
the people at Bef?:icon ; I have never yet
had the 1 time to resume my correspondence
with them, and I have no means of know
ing any thing with regard to their situation.
" As far as some names are concerned,
you are now as well informed as I am, with
regard to the secrets of the conspiracy. In
order to overthrow it, I am perfeftly con
vinced that it wtmld be fufficient to publish
my letter and the regulations of the two so
cieties. At the perusal of this declaration,
you will fee all the royalists again fink to
the earth, and for this time you may be
perfectly tranquil; but it is not enough
that they should defifl from them for a mo
ment. It is necefTary for ever to root the
idea from their minds. It is necefTary to
turn to the advantage of the government
the discovery of the present conspiracy,
and to resign into its hands the threads by
which others may be-traced. I proceed to
develope this last part, and I shall then give
my opinion "upon the other. Two things
must happenâthe firft, that the royalists
who imagiue that the government is only
in poffefiion of the chiefs of the coufpiracy>
and nothing at all of its general train, and
who -at the fame time arc attached to the
principles of moderation upon which our
plan is founded, will be desirous to continue
it. In consequence, they will propose to
the king and the Englilh to fend in con
jundtion one or more new agents to fuceeed
us, and to fallow our trad, but with flill
greater precaution. The other thing is,
that a Royalist Party, which is convinced
that it is impofijble to overthrow the Go
vernment by any other means thas by vio
lence, strengthened by our bad fuecefs,
will at once present themselves at London
and at Blankenbyrg, and desire to be en
trufled with those means which we were a
bout to. employ so difadvantageoufly, pro
mising that by the alliances which they will
contract with the Jacobins, those energet
ic men they will thus throw France back
into the system of terror, and from the sys
tem of terror to the Throne. That party
would be at London, if it were to be rejeft
ed at|Blankenburg. But it is by no means
certain that it would be rejeiled in that
Court, and in that cafe the English Minis
ter, in order to avoid the appearance of be
ing apprized of the means to be employed,
would allow the business to proceed.
" To this long explanation T have just a
notherword to add. There exists a formed
Party, which reckons u,"jn the future sup
port of Spain. At the head of this party
are M. M. de la Vauguyoo and D' Antria
gues. I (hall give their channels of corre
spondence with the Interior. This party
think that they have on their fide the King
of Spain, and among other individuals the
Marquis de las Cafas.

The decree of famine pafled some days a

At the moment in which it should take

A fort of fatality has led the order of the

perfidy has been able to mislead the zeal Â«f
the armies, whom prudence ftiould seek to
enlighten. We have; however, reason to
believe, that public order will not be distur
bed, and that the constitutional laws will
be refpeded. We could ebferve, during
the last crlfis, as during the period which
preceded it, that the public opinion was
strongly pronounced for the support of the
constitution, and that it was adverse to every
attack, and even to every appearance of at
tack on this pledge of its repose. It will
even incline towards that party which shall
maintain with force and moderation aa ho
nourable defence. Beyond this, there is
nothing bet error and danger.

NEW-YORK, November 11
TURKS ISLAND.
We can from 'the belt authority inform
the public, that Salt can be purchased at
Turks Illand lower at present, than has ever
been remembered since our disunion with
Great-Britain. The French privateers have
interrupted almod every vessel bound there
from the Windward Iflnnds, which has re
duced the inhabitants to the greated scarcity
both of money and provisions. A more
favorable fait season has never been remem
bered than the present, which, added to the
large quantities of last year's crop, kept up
by speculator's for a high market, has oc
casioned this rapid fall in the price.âOn the
15th of-Augud lad, the (hip Edward, of
Providence, (R. I.) owned by Edward
Dider, merchant there, and commanded by
John Pattis, arrived with about 400 bufliels
of corn, a dozen barrels of flour, and 3 or
4 barrels of beef and porkâHe carried no
ca(h, and was obliged to fell as much corn
r.t VB (hillings per buftiel, as would pay his
tonnage duty and feesâthe remainder he
put up at vendue, payable in fait at the
nominal market price, which was eighteen
penceâHis corn brought thirty {hillings
perbufhel, his flour, beef and pork in pro
portion, so, with that trifling adventure, he
loaded his own (hip, and left a surplus of
fait behind, fijfficient tcjoad two more such
vessels, wliieh he will fei*} for on his arrival. t
Had he carried cash, he might have pur
chased his cargo at five pence per bushel. j
There are sworn measurers appointed in :
the island, and the bushel tub measuring 38
Vine quarts is Aamped by an infpeftor, lo
that the ufiial deficiency on fait cargoei is
not much to be apprehended. There is also
a new regulation in the boating, which ena
bled captain Pattis to load his flip in four
hours. Americans are treated with the ut
most kindnefÂ» and attention. The island of
Grand Key has been lately fortified, since
which, the have been principally
governed by military law.
The number of laws made in France since
the commencement of the revolution, ia
computed to amount to upwards of 16,000 !
It is said that the eicpeftations of a peace
had, in England, got to be very sanguine,
btfore the late change of affairs in Paris.
Mr. Boyd, one of the mod moniid men of
London, had jult before visited Paris on a
paflport from Carnot; and during a short
relidence there had become so assured of a
fp'eedy peace, as to induce him to purchase
jn the British funds to an immeofe amount.
By an edift of the king of Spain, the
immunity of his coafls has been fixed at
2950 toifes, All the (hips which fliall be
taken at a greater distance are to be con
sidered as taken on the high seas.
We read in the mefTage from the direfto
ry, published in the Redafteur, that the
arrears up to the 33d of September lad, a
mount to about 700 millions. If we fup
poie that the expenses in arrear since that
period, amount to a likefum, which appears
to be a tolerable accurate calculation, we
mnft conclude that the debt of the (late has
increased, since the fupprelTion of thÂ« aflig
nats, near 1500 millions.
(Tableau dela France et de I'Europe.)
It is (aid to be the intention of the em
peror of Russia to open an asylum, when
p?ace fliall take plaee, for all French emi
grants, and to grant the chief of them the
privileges enjoyed by the Ruffian nobility.

VIENNA, Aug. 30,
The lail difpa"tches receivsd from the
marquis de Gallo, were dated from Udina,
the 20th of August. They bring advice
that the marquis had font a Courier to Gen
eral Buonaparte, to inform him of his arri
val at Udiria ; and the general must by this
time met him there. Our court, as
may be expeÂ£led, continues its preparations
for war, with the utmost a&ivity ; we doubt
not, however, that a definitive peace will
very (hortly be signed at Udina. It is hop
ed, that such modifications will be adopted,
with refpeft to Mantua, as (hall be fatisfac
tory to both parties. Should Austria pos
sess the country on the Banks of the river
Adige, the money offered by the Cisalpine
republic will enable, the Emperor to build
strong fortreffes along that river; and (hould
Mantua be ceded to France, orthe Cisalpine
republic, it will, no doubt, fee on such con
ditions las (hall be perfeftly confident with
the interests of Austria und its new Frontiers.
The 4ifpute, however, will now be very
fliortlydttermined ; and withinafewmonths
time, notice will be given to the army "of
the Hungarian levy, whether farther em
ployment will be found for it, or whether it
tnay return home.
As the German troops in Italy have fuf
fered severely by the heat of the country,
and the diseases occafionedby if, they are to
be recalld, and Croats who are more used
to the Climate, lent in their (lead.
MILANv Aug. 21.
General Buonaparte has at length set out
in, the nig;ht of the 22d for Udina, by the
way of Palrna Nuova. He will Hkewife
take in his way and infpe& thp frontiers,
and the Barromean islands, in the lake of
Milan, <?r Lago Maggiore. " Heis gone,"
fays one of the Gazettes published here,
Â« bearing the olive branch in one hand and
the fwor din the other. No one now enter
tains a dqubt but that cither a definitive
peace will be very lhortly frgned at Udina,
â¢r hostilities foan recommence, The pre
pnvations for war continue t6 be carried on
both by Buonaparte and the CiGilpine re
public, with rhe ulmod vigour. French
and Cisalpine troops, with field artillery
and ammunition are daily marching to Pal
ma Nuova, Trevigo, and Verona; while
artillery and military|dares are continually
on their way to Mantua from Genoa, Nice
and other places on that fide. It is like
wise expe'&ed should hostilities again take
place that the French will be joined by 20,
000 Piedmontefe troops.
LONDON, Sept. 14,
A letter from an officer on board admiral
Duncan's fleet, dated the 27th ult. fays,
" The transports belonging to the Dutch
armament in the Texel, all went up, (we
suppose to Amsterdam). lad week ; for on
the morning of the we could not fee
the hulls of the men of war, thirty three
in number, from our quarter deck, at which
time.there was not a merchant (hip or trans
port in the Texel, but a fquadrdn of four
frigates and three biigs were in the outer
road, attempting to make what we eall a
dart. On our approach they all turned in
again. We are now ftatiened off the Viie,
a few leagues north east of tUt Texel, from
which we conclude that the admiral fufpefts
the Dutch fleet, on the event of getting
out, mean to deer for the Elbe. The mo
ment the wind veers to the "eastward, we
push for thft Texel, and anchor before it ;
when the wind frefhens from the wedward,
we weigh and stand off eight or ten leagues,
always leaving light cruisers in view, who

Admiralty-Office, Sept. 16.
Extraft of a letter from the right hon. lord
Bridport, K. B. commander in chief of
the channel fleet, to Evan Nepean, esq.
secretary of the admiralty, dated on board
his majesty's ship Royal Gedrge, at Tor
bay, the 13th Sept. 1797.
Sir,
Herewith you will receive copies of let
ters, with the papers therein referred to,
from Commodore fir John Borlafe Warren,
which I transmitted for their lordships in
formation. I am, &c.
La Pomone, at Sea, August 12, 1797
My Lord,
I beg leave to inform your Lor3(hip, that
on the morning of the nth instant, a con
voy of the enemy, with a ship Corvette, a
brig and fehooner gun boats, two armed
luggers, several ChasTe Marces and brigs,
were discovered Sanding to sea, out of the
Pertuis de Breton, from Rochfort: I at
tempted to cut them off or destroy them
with La Pomone and Jason, who attacked
a fort, in order to cover the Sylph, who
wa3 anchored near the two corvettes, having
left the Triton in ehace to windward ; the
enemy, perceiving our intention, anchored
at the entrance of the river of Sable d'O
lonne, close under the fort, the ship cor
vette and gun boat with springs upon their
cables.
At eleven, being near enough, the firing
commenced and continued for an hour,when
the gun-boat shipped her cables to run on
shore, but funk before she got into the river,
near the small vessels, and the corvette re
mained faft agronnd, but deserted by her
people and much damaged. As I did not
think it possible to set her on fire with the
boats of the squadron, there being little
wind, and the tide of flood setting us upon
the coast, we hauled our wind to the south
ward.
I have the fatisfaction of acquainting your
lordship, that it has ocafioned a delay for
some time of the enemy's supplies arriving
at Brest, as one of the vessels is destroyed,
and it is doubtful if the othei can be repair
ed so as to be of any use in future.
The (hips of the fquadt;on have sustained
ver/ trifling damages. A return of the kil
led aRd wouiided in each (hip is inclosed.
I have only to lament, that a more favor
able moment did not present itfelf to afford
the officers and mep an opportunity of dis
tinguishing thejnfelves: but the enemy must
have fuffered considerably on beard the ves
sels and in the fort, from the number of (hot
that struck them.
Some hot (hot were fired from a battery
of five guns, which set - fire to the Sylph,
but any ill effedls were prevented by the ex
erticms of â¢fficers and men of that vessel,

MR. ?EN Vo,
IF the afiertion that the frig's to royalty
'n France, nave occafiored the late revolu
tion in favor of the triumvirate, be true,
there can be little doubt of their having aÂ£fc
ed by a finefle. Perhaps the surest game of
the royalists was to persuade the executive,
by a breach of the constitution, to remove as"
many as possible ps the most powerful repub
licaas, in point of talents, from their feats
in the legislature; for while fucb men as
Pichegru, Barthelemy, Carnot, Boiffy D'-
Anglas, &c. &c. enjoyed the public confi
dence, the republican constitution of the 3d
year was fafe. Btjt .whether the triumvirate
have, like Othello, been the dupes of fc
cret enemies in their late liberticide measures,
or not, time only can fliew. Nor is it im
portant which, if the event must be the fame
in either cafe. .The moment the people and
the army awake from their transient dream,
it is most likely they will, one and all, sigh
for a permanent government, which (hall rid
them of a faftion of demagogues who sport
with the public freedom and happiness.'
