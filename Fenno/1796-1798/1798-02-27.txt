Such, alf ,it the cafe with a nation. When it

or tr w .rd its ruin, -aiv' nottwJteu the vigaience

and in the second. to mourn over its departed

By attending to the history of the French a
gents in our country, since the year 179.1, I
much uu.judgr, if we do not fii.d that the Unit

tions ; and I tnuebmore deceive myfelf. if it ii
l<Bt now nearly reacy to verify it second ly
txtcuting vengeance upon those who have heen
inftrumenta) in facrificing its prafpen'y. For,
fhowld this cmnHiy be involved in a war with
France, it will be remembered, by those who
have to lufhin the burthen of it, that it has heen
indnted by the Fren. h partizant in this coun
try ; thoft who have uniformly opposed the in
terest. of the L'ni ed States in favour of France.
Ai d, in caie of 1 war, it will then be neceflary
for 1 hem, either the strongest pat ry, ar.'d

incensed union, fighting under the sacred ban

its dearest Bold afTertiort, and flu
ent prevarication will rot thea avail; nor will
rt then answer to change their fides ; for those
who have iu a time of natir nal feevrity, with de- .
liberate calculation, deferred the national inter

national U.-nger, be maiked with, diftrufr,
treated with that Hath nal severity which insult
and injury jufily irtfpire.
I Ihjllnot attempt to trace the history of the
French influence, ai.d French inttreft in the U
nited Ststts, Ence the year 1793. h has so of
ten been dor.e, that those who are now unac
quainted u ;th it, wr>uld prnbably remain unen
lighteoed, though it fhohld be rtpcated many
times. To remain uninformed, th-y must have
shut their eyes on evidence, closed their ears a
gainfl information, and obflinaiely fixed their
hearts in unbelief. Phe ultimate ohj<3 which
it hit uniformly had in view, and of which it
has not yet loft fight, is ihe proflratjon of our '
independence, and the fuhv'erfion of ourconft -
luuon. *rhit hat, atfo, been often proved Â£ aot'
it has now, J fear, frooi its frpquent illuflrition,
loft much ot its influence nptfn the public mind.
However. I (hall once more trace it ; for, pofji
bly, in the lafl fteji of daager, (and let it be
noted, we now star.d on that very step) my
countrymen, when viewing the precipice before
thÂ«m, while there is yet one step left between
them and deftruclion, may turn from if, and
with ajuft indignation, hunt those from office,
wb# have blicdly urged them on to defparuion
Clnr government mult be supported, or it
auft fall. To support ir, there must be are
venue. That revenue must be ra led hv diretft
or of by indireiTt taxation. The revenue of our
government, is raised principally by the latter;
and tnat arises, in much the largest proportion,
from duties on our commrtce. If, therefore
our commerce is deftroyrd, the reveaue refill
ing from that, niuT nercfTari'y fail Thegov
ernmeiit then mn(t fall, or it mufl'be supported
by a revenue, taifedhy Jirc!} taxation. Adi
riyTl taxation must fall immediately upon the
is' -iters rjieir ho-ifes. lands, eattle, and all
their <ryperty, must contribute a certain pro
portion to futiport the g ivernmentâor the g->
vernmerit must fink for want of a revenue, if
the indirect taxation is destroyedâand the in
diretii taxation is destroyed the moment that
commerce is destroyed. The antiferlerals flatter
themselves. that a direct tax would be so ui; fTt'p
ular, thai it would prove impracticable ; and,
therefore, if they can acsompli h the deftruitian
of our commerce, their obje& ii at once effect
edâfince the government falls, of courf , fjr
want of a revenue to support it. By the con
duti ot Mr. Monroe, Mr. Jefferfon, and their
adherents, our commerce ij nearly destroyed,
tnd they are near to realizing what they so ar
dently desire, viz. a revolutions predicated upon
the prostration of the federal confutation. And,
Ihould oongrefs refufe to fuffcr the merchants to

I, V. llliam Gordon, do teftify and fay,
that on the morning of ths 15th of Febru
ary inflant, about the hour of eleven, I
went to the hall of the heiufeof representa
tives. Very foÂ»n after I had entered, I
observed Mr. Grifwold come with a cane in
hit hand. In the course of a few minutet
aftcrwardi Mr. Lyon also came into the
house, and immediately went and placed
kimfclf in the feat which he has usually oe
eapied, nearly oppnfite to the chair of the
speaker. He had in kit hand a cane, which
at he seated himfelf he placed behind him.
On facing him I immediately threw my eyes ,
u(>on Mr. Cn'fwold, but could not difoMfr
that he law or took notice 01 hipi. At liiij
time the speaker wat in kin chair and writ
ing, at ii usually the cafc it that hour of
the day, but tht house kad not come nor
had it been called to order. Few members,
comparatively fpeakiag, were within'the
bar. In the course of a very few minutes
after Mr. Lyon had seated himfelf, I saw
Mr Grifwold with hit cane in hit hand, ad
vancing from the floor to the left of the
chair of the fpnalser, with a Tery quick and
flrong step towards Mr. Lyon. At he ad
vanced he raised his cane, and uttered an
exclamation of rascal, or scoundrel, or of
the like import. Before Mr. Grifwold
reached him, Mr. Lyon, acc\>rdiag to tire
best of my recolleition, bad partly risen up,
from which I conclude be had discovered
Mr. Grifwold approaching him. As soon
as Mr. Grifwold was within such a diftaace
from Mr. Lyon at to reach him with effeft,
he instantly appl.ed his cane with great force
to his back and shoulders. As soon as Mr.
Lyon was able to effeft it, he made his way
from the feats into the floor on the inner
fide of the feats, then quickly advanced to
wards Mr. Grifwold, apparently with in
tent either to catch hold of his cant or to
close with him. Mr. Grifwold fteaned to
be aware of hit intention, llepping back
wards in such a manner >s to keep Mr. Ly
on at a proper diltance for the use of bis
cane, rapidly applied it to his back and
shoulders. As soon is Mr. Lyon had got
to the line of the pafTage behind the fpeak
er't chair, he rnflantlv attempted Â»o escape
that way to the oppnfite fide of she house.
Mr. Grifwold pursuing him, gave him three
or four blows acrofithe back. At thit
time I observed Mr. Lyon turning, it ap
pearing to me that he was prevented from
palling any further in tjiat, direction by the
crowd that was advancing towards thefceae
of action. After he turned he seized the
tongs by the fire fide, and Mr. Grifwold
then being very near to him, (truck him wijh
tnem. Mr. Grifwold laid hold of ttiem,
and they immediately cleftd in with caaj'
other. After ji fliort struggle Mr. Grff
wold threw Mr. Lyon on the floor, and fell
upon him. They laid some little time in
this fltuation, Mr. Grifwold attempting to
disentangle himfelf from the grasp of Mr.
Lyon in order to pursue his chastisement
further, and had nearly effected it and pla
ced himfelf in a situation proper for' that
purpose, when two or three petfont laid
hold of him, and drew .him off from Mr.
Lyon. While down, bÂ£' gave Mr. Lyon
one blow in tlic face, and wrested the tongs
from his hands. When separated, I saw
Mr. Grifwold go towards the oatfide of the
bar, I suppose with a view to take some
watier. Shortly afterwards I saw Mr. Ly
on making towards that part of the house
where Mr. Grifwold was. He approached
Mr. Grifwold, who was Handing at the en
trance ''f the bar, and struck him with a
cane. Mr. Grifwold't cane was inflantly
handed him, and .be was making again to
wards Mr. Lyon, when there was a loud
call to order for the firft time ; this was in
itarttly repeated by the fpeakcr : I laid hold
of Mr Grifwold, sundry persons threw
themselves between him and Mr. Lyon,
and Mr. Qrifw'olj instantly retired and took
his feat. .

On Thursday morning lart, having been
engaged in writing in my room until ! tho't
it very late. I entered the house of repre
sentatives with some surprise, at not finding
it engaged in business. The speaker fat (I
think) writing in hit chair, as I crossed the
floor to the letterbox ; and onTeturningto
my feat, I saw Mr. Lyon in his feat, in
the porture of writing, or reading papers
lying on his desk before him, having his
hat on, and not appearing to perceive roe to
pass him, although very near him. From
my feat, which is the second in the third
row,, almost direfily behind his, which is
the middle feat in the front row, I observed
him in the fame posture immediately before
I heard the firft blow of a cane ; upon hear
ing which, I observed him still fitting, with
one arm in the position of covering his head
and warding off blows, and the other in
teeling, as I thought, for a cane on the floor
beside or before him. I saw Mr. Grifwold
at this time on the open floor directly be
fore him, beating him with all the strength
and dexterity apparently i'b his power, with
a carie of the flouted kind of American
made hickory, and repeating his blows as
faff as I thought he could make them. Un
der this pressure, Mr. Lyon, in a defence-
Isfs date, made cut of his feat fide way,
being hemmed in before and behind by the
defies and feats, so that it was wholly out
of hi 6 power to escape a single blow, or to
interrupt Mr. Grifwold in the aft of beat
ing him. Immediately, I myfelf, for one,
role in my feat, and loudly and repeatedly
called out to the chair for order. I heard
the fame call from different parts of the
house ; but I did not observe or hear any
effort from the speaker to reflor? it, or any
personal attempt by any one near to inter
fere and prevent the attack. On the con
trary, I think I diftinftly heard the fpeak
ei reply, that the house had not yet been
called to order, as a reason for not interfer
ing at all. At soon as Mr. Lyoo had got
out of the row of feats, he made towards
Mr. Grifwold and made every effort to close
with him (as it appeared to me). Mr.
Grifwold on his part, avoided this by hold
ing him off with his left arm, fleppiug back,
and continuing to beat Mr. Lyon with his
cane, at before, until in this way they
both got to the fire place, to the left of
the fpeaker't chair. I then heard the noise
of the tongs, and immediately after saw
them hare hold of each other, and Mr.
Gnfwold'i cane falling out of hit band.
Soon after iK y boll. feil, Waving hold of
each other, Mr. GrifwoM partly upoa Mr.
Lyon. At -this time, .1 to the place
where they were engaged, and called out
to part thtm. I heard the fame cry from
behind the chair, and I also heard the op
posite cry from otheri not to fart tb-mâMr.
Havens ind my'felf each took hold ef Mr.
Grifwold'ilegf, and I think, together drew
him off from Mr. Lyon. At the fame time,
I think, I saw others having hold of Mr.
Lyon. When the speaker obferred Mr.
Havens and myfelf taking hold of Mr. Grif
wold, lie with apparent warmth, jj if there
by to prevent our interfering, called out,
in substance, at nearly ai f can recolledt,
Wt. at ! tale hold of a man by the lege-âthat it
noway to take hold of kin. Nocwithftand
ing I perfevcrtd, and I think Mr. Havens
aflifted me in drawing Mr. Grifwold apart
frÂ»m Mr. Lyon. Mr. Lyon Went direct
from that place to h ; s feaj, where he Rot a
fmallcane, and went from thence south of
the bar, where 1 saw him and Mr. Grifwold
soon after meeting, and Mr. Lyon making
up to hiin. Mr. Grifwold retiring from M r -
Lyon, and Mr. Lyofl making 3 blow at
him with his cane, which Mr. Grifwold,
I t'nink, received 00 his arm or shoulder.
The loud cry of order from all pai ts ps the
house, and from th< chair, here put an end
to the affray. Mr. Grifwold'a cane was
delivered to him by Mr. Sitgreaves, I think
jurt as he stepped within the bar, which he
took frpoi thence, J think, direA to his
feat. Mr. Lyon without the bar, and thus
the affray ertded, remained and the house
proceeded to bitfinefs. .

Mr. Stanford's Tjlimouy.
When the riot commenced in the hall of
Congress on the morning of the Ijth inft.
between Mr. Grifwold andMr.Lynn, it was
about twenty or thirty minutes after eleven
o'clock. Prayers were over, but the house
not called to order. Sitting in mjr chair, I
was attentively reading some letters I had
Jiift received. In an inilant the fiidden
buttle arretted my notice. Not having ob
served eitfitr of the parties enter the hall, I
then saw Mr. Grifwold on the area of the
floor, wiihan apparently heavy (tick, ma
king a blow (perhaps not the firft) at Mr.
Lyon, who was between his de(k and chair
in an half rising position. This blow, I
think, he received on hi 3 left arm and shoul
der, and a fecund as he was disengaging
himfelf from among the defkt and chairs.
Once poffefling the floor, hÂ« essayed to join
Mr. Grifwold, whÂ© evaded him by a retro
gade flep and a third blow, which fell upon
Mr. Lyon's head, his hat being off. Then
V,eating back a little to the-left of the Speak
cr's deflc as Mr. Grifwold approached, rc
peating his (trokes, Mr, Lyon'again attemp
ted to close in wj'tji him, but failed, and
made suddenly behind the Speaker's dtflc,
which,
moment intercepted my view. Then in
ftintly again I faw,Mr. Lyon with a pair
of tongs elevated fÂ«r a flroke at Mr. Grif
wold, wfciah, seemed, to be somehow parried,
so as not to be fully, made. A collifioa, I
think, of the fticik,? tongs and persons now
took place, Mr. Grilwold about this time
loft his flick ; that rfung, they came down
both together ; the fall I rather think I
did not lee, from thi; intervening members,
but whendown they appeared tobegrappled
about the head and /houlders, and -Mr. Grif
wo[d rather upperntofl. The confuiion of
the house was great, and the cry Â«' part
them," pretty gen< ral. Thus while some
gentlemen were- difÂ« ntangling their hands,
others had Mr. Grifwold by the legs, and
were pulling him a way, which was effedted,
The Speaker ftatif.ling on the steps of his
desk, said, that it was either unfair or un
gentlemanly totakeaman thus by the legs.
Gen.M'Dowel then observed, that he (the
Speaker) had aÂ£tedl his part in the bufmefs,
and the Speaker aflking what he said, Gen.
M'Dowcll repealed his observation, and the
Speaker answered, what could he do, the
house was not called to order, he could not
help the event. The General replied he
fuppoled he could not.
The parties having been separated andleft
at large, they eafually met again after a
small space, at the south water (land with
out the bar, when Mr. Lyon, as soon as he
appeared to discover whp it was, raised his
(tick, which he bad got hold Â©f in j the in
terval, and (truck Mr. Grifwcdd on the
(houlder or arm. Tbe (troke was quite
light, beiÃg haftilv made, and with a (tick
not very large. Mr. Grifwold then beat
back to the entrance of the bar, where
some one, I think Mr. Sitgreaves, ran, and
met him with a similar, or the fane stick
which he had loft in the firft rencontre.âMr.
Lyon also, after (trikitig, stepped back
from the water (land, elevated his stick, and I
flood in an attitude of defence. Now it I
was that the Speaker called to order, and !
no other conflift ensued. Mr. Grifwold
presently returned to his feat, and Mr. Ly- I
on remained at the water (land. The above
detail is as oorreft as my memory fervei me
to give of so unexpected a fracae within the
walls of the House.

Thee H A Net LLoa ofthc EXCH
right honorable gentleman founds his argu
ment for delay upon the agitation which this
qurftion has excit-ed in the public mind, and
the obje&ions to which the measure is liable
in its application to a great number of hit
constituents. lam aware that in all great
to was, particularly in the metropolis, the
objections will be felt with peculiar force,
but at the fame time, I am sensible that in
the proviflons of whVh tbe bill is fufcepti
l>le many modifications may be expe&ed,
many are practicable, confidently with the
leading principle of the measure, and many
arc necessary, in order as far as poflible, to
prevent it from bearing hard ih particular
instances. lam aware Â«ven that greater
modifications may be necessary than appear
ed to me requilite upon the firft eonfiderati
on ot the fubjeijt, and when the firft imper
fect outline of it was prelented. This how
ever, does not by any means tend to impeach
the general principle of the measure. These
objections are capable of modification with
out defeating the salutary object which it is
the purpose of the measure to secure. In
stead of feeling these objedtioiisas compjete
ly deftru&ive of the principle, every hours
reflection convinces me, that though it is
our duty to enquire in what refpefts modifi
cation may be proper, how it may be prac
ticable, how mitigation may be given so as
to prevent any oppreffivs application of the
measure, yet as to the general neccffity of
providing for the public fafety, and repell
ing the danger by which we are threatened,
on the determination we fliall form upon this
question after mature discussion, depends
whether,by the exertion we havtpledged our
felvet to make, we (hall rescue the country
from impending calamity, and lay the foun
dation of as great a portion of future great-'
ness and prosperity as any nation ever en
joyed ? or whether we shall surrender the dig
nity ot the Brililh nation, and expose to in
evitable ruin the fourtes of its glory and its
power? Feeling, as the reprefrntatrves of
the people, that it is our duty to provide â 
for these important and essential pbjefts, we
shall be deteried by na difficulties, wc (hall '
spare no pains, we shall facrifice every local
prejudice, every partial opinion, to a con
(cioufnefs of the neccffity in which we are
placed, to ipake a vigorous exertion. Feel
ing as I do, that necessity, I know my duty
too well, not to persist in'what I conceive
to be a measure calculated to serve the coun
try from impending danger, and enable it to
struggle against future attacks. . It is our
firm duty, as guardians, to provide for its
present (afety, and to transmit to posterity
the blessings which we have enjoyed, and
the means of preserving them. It is '>y
these great confederations that our conduit
ought to be diredted ; it is by these great
maxims of policy that the measure ought to
be judged. ' Can we then conceive it onr
duty, on account of (ome particular objec
tions, of some ailedged hardfhjp of applica
tion, to Hang up. the Bill altogether, before
it3 provisions have been difruffed, before its
details have been arranged, must we forego'
the opportun ty of suggesting the cafe,
where the evil would be fek, of removing
prejudice where it exllts,' and obviating ob-|
jeftions where they are well founded ? In
(lead of agreeing to any delay both in real
refpedt to those who complain of the hard
ship with which the Bill in its present shape
would attach, in duty to the public for the
service of which, in this important crisis, we
are called upon to provide, we nught to lose
no time to examine the Bill with the utmoit
attention and fee where the pressure which
it would occsfion may be migitated. What
are the particulars and extent of the further
modifications which it may be (till necessary
to introduce, it will not be incumbent on me
now to state. It will be recollected, that
when I firft opened the fubjeit, 1 dated that
as a vililjlc criterion ot income, I preferred
the payment of the assessed taxes, because
it was more comprel enfive, better calculat
ed to diffufe the burden, more susceptible of
modification in the various classes where it
would be required, than any other criterion
which could be taken. It will Be recolleft
ed that one great recommendation of this
criterion" I stated to be, that the principle
being (till prefcrved, it furnifhed greater
means of modification, and more opportu
nity for providing for the particular cases
of hardlbip and inconvenience than any o
thef criterion which could be adopted. The
means of this modification are now in our
1 power, and we shall but perform our duty
to our constituents, by (hewing our readi
ness to consider the inconvenience, and to
apply the remedy.
That many modifications are necessary I
am aware, and in the committee, both those
which I may propose, and which others
may suggest, will be considered. This I
trufl will be a fufficient answer to what fell
from a worthy alderman (Lufhington)at the
beginning of the debate. Much at I differ
from that honorable gentleman as to the ex
tent of the abatetnent, and the'nature of the
scale of contribution he proposed, I was
glad to hear the manly and decided manner
in which he enforced the necessity of great
exertion, and the propriety of raising a con'
fiderable sum, without recurring to the sys
tem of funding. lam convinced that the
ientiments he expressed were congenial to
the feelings,ot a great majority of his con.-
ftitu-cints and of the country, and I could
not help remarking the contrail between the
language he held, and the tone of the hon
orable gentleman on the other fide, compar
ed with the sentiments of their refpeftivc
constituents, in the iodifcriminate opposition
ro every part of the plan, which charadter
ifed the speeches of both the honorable gen
tlemen. Ido not complain of the wide
field of 'argument which they took up ; I
Itnow that in a parliamentary sense they were
regular; vhetheflhey were juftiÂ£il.!e in ih
I ulc they made of th.Â» piivilcge, and whe
ther tbey made a proper choice of the :opicÂ»
which they introduced on the prefeot fiib.
jest, I fhaltyleave for the house to determine.
The objeft of this bill (hortly iÂ«, for an ex
traordinary grant of money for the fnpport
los the war. It proposes to raise within the
year, a certain part of the Tupping, by a
tax on income, on the visible criterion of thÂ»
affefled taxea, fubjeft to modifications ai
circumstances may require, In considering
the whole of the cafe then, the firft question
that occurs is, whether it is proper to grant
any money at all ? then, Whether the pun
ciplc of railing a certain part within the year
ought to be admitted? and, thirdly, Whe
ther by this criterion attaching to income
in the course of expenditure, the burden
would in general be fairly apportioned ?
As to the firft point, whether any money at
all aught to be granted ? the honorable gen
tleman (Mr. Sheridan) though he did not.
fay so in very words, by the whole of his
argument supposed the negative. The right
honorable gentleman who fpokelaft diftiniSl
ly argued, that while miniftess continued
in power, he could not agree to any supplies
being granted. In Jlatiug this to have been
their meaning, I am endeavoring to iio jus
tice to' their mode of reafor.ing. (Jnlefs up
on this, idea more than three fourthaof their
observations were irrelevant to the fubjeft
now before the house. If they dp not con.
tend that peace cannot be obtained by the
present mini ft era, th.it they ought to be dif
niiiTed before any scheme of supply can at
all be a fit fubjedt for difculTion, the great,
er pait of their argument is quite foreign,
to the matter now tinder confidetatlon. The
right honorable gentleman, while heargue*
that my honorable friend (Mr. DundaÂ»)
considered the majority of the house and his
majesty's miniftsrs as the fame, forgets that
his honorable friend (Mr. Sheridan) when
he talked of our going out of our plaees,
did not address hrofelf to the houie, but
gave it as a very friendly advice, bo doubt,
to us. It was expressed with a
hope that'we would of ourselves abandon
the offices we held as the means of obtaining
peace. Thrhonorable gentleman then must
fettle this inconliflency with his honorable
friend beside him. But before the honora
ble gentlemau, with all his talents, can de
mouitrate the propriety of our dismissal, he
i ought to fliew that the nine persons whom
he proposes to pick up between London and
Windsor, will administer the public affair's
better than those by whom they are now ad
ministered; he must bring forward fomcthing
n)t>rc concluiive and more convincing than
any thing he had to offer,when'the dismissal
of minilters was last dlfcufled, the failure of
which attempt had induced him to quit the
fcrvice of his his despair
of success had led him to abdicate his public
chataftcr. If I understand him right, he
ponliders as preliminary to every m.afure of
public defence, to every exertion in support
u; the war, a radical change is ncceff?ry.
What the right honorable gentleman means
by the preliminary, expressed in a manner
so large and ccir.erebenitvt, in :cr/ns no Ufa
ebfeure than bndennedâwhether a parlia
mentary reform is to be only a part of this
sweeping changeâhow this change of sys
tem is to operate as a means of laving the
countryâhow thÂ« uulipiited change is to
conduce to the public fafety, in preparing
exertion, and in.repelling danger, I am re
ally at a loss to conceive. In considering
the propriety of such a change of system,
or preliminary to the introduflioii of new
men into office, it certainly will be impor
tant for the house to corifidriy whether inch
a change of miniilers is calculated to secure
us' against the dangers with which >ve are
threatened, whether it is calculated to check
the ambition of the enemy, and to procure
a peace that will fatisfy the honor of the rip
tion, and preserve the sources of the public
wealth :and prosperity. But the honorable
gentleman fays, that the whole tenpr of
our language at the beginning of the pre
fjnt conteil was, that no. peace could be
made with the Jacobin republic# and that
France i 6 thus juftiljed ; n refufiug to
make geayr with theprefent adminiftiation.
At no period of the war did we ever expref* "
fuclv a sentiment, or even entertain the idea
that no peace could be made vith Republi
can prince. I remember the quotation from
Virgil to which he has alluded, and as far
as I can reooHeft, it was used in one Â»f those
debates in which the right honurable
tleman proposed that overtures (hould be
made for peaie at a period when we conten
ded that no fecurily for peace could be ob
tained, and that the evils of war were not
to be compared to the inadequate peace
which then could have been concluded.'â
The right honourable gentleman then urged
the question, whether no extremity of dan
ger could induce us to make such overtures ?
I then anfwured that this must ever be a
question of eomparifon, that we must decide
as circumstances might ari'fe and at least we
ought to persevere till our means were e*-
haufted, till we could support the contell
no longer, and we could fay, toto certatum
ejl carport regni. The honurable gentleman .
fays, that the meaning of Virgil cannot be
explained away, but he seemed to think
that Virgil's language cannot be improved.
The honourable gentleman urged the pro
priety of making overtures even at that pe
riod and contended, as he often had done,
that if reasonable terms ofpeaee were refu
fÂ«d, it would unite England divide France.
He then ictorted that after such overtures
were rejefted, totu ccrtnndum ejl tarpore reg
nj.
The Honourable iwtr-fiecj
these overtures made and rcjedled; and now
when he wishes to bind me down to the
meaning of Virgil, I think he ought not to
forget his Latin pledge. If the honourable
gentleman hss lcen that all attempts at ne
gociation have been Unavailable, if he can
look to any j n which he is called up
on to fulfil y.{ % pledge; if he (Ticaus to ani
mate the public exertions, to cxh&rt to prr-feveranee, to (liinnlate their xeal f.r the
maintenance of the national honour and the
natjonal fafety, at a moment when these ob
jeÂ£ts are thus unequivocally dated, he would
â ot, at he now dot >, attempt to disarm their
courage and to didrad their efforts. What
did the honroable gentleman expeift from
the overture* he proposed? What degree
of insult and contumely did he lay hii ac
count to endme before he nilrouzed to en
ergy and to honour? Did he,expeÂ£t any
thing more insulting than the reception our
overtures had obtained, any thing more rc
pulfive, more haughty, more injurious, than
the proceedings of the enemy? any thing
more decisive of their determined spirit of
hodility. than their refufal to difcufi the
terms we proposed, or to propose any terms
in their turn on which they were willing to
conclude a peace ? If any thing can meet the
Hon. gentleman's ideas of insult fnfficiently
humiliating to require him to ad upon this
pledge, let him look to the negociations at
LiOe, and the conduit of the enemy upon
that occasion. At no period did we fay
tlvrre could be no peace with Republican
France. We said that for peace we would
not agree to prodrate the nation at the feet
of the enemy { that we could not agree to
give up what was tfitntial to the fafety of
the country. If the Hon. Gentleman can
prove that we haÂ»e applied for peace, dis
owning the juftict of our canfe,abandoning
the principle of which the present fafety and
future prosperity on the country are found
ed, he would prove that we cor.fidtred the
period arrived when every exertion had been
made, and when the druggie was to. be gi
ven up because it could no longer be support
edâThe Hon. Gentleman however, does
not fay that we have aded in this manner.
What, then are the opinions of those who
have uniformly, or tather with growing teal
and devotion have contended that the war
wasjuft on the part of France, and unjufl
upon the other fide of the contest ?âHave
they not repeatedly said on former occasions
that our ordinary resources were exhauded!
tnd.lp day, with mifterious file nee, they
pafa over the fubjedl, and cautiously decline
giving any opinion on the efficacy of former
resources, while they reprobate new expe
dients; and fay nothing as to the propriety
of retorting to the Funding fyllem, while
they condemn the principle of every plan by
which it may be relieved. The Hon. gen
tlemen have said, that our ordinary resour
ces are exhauded, and that no extraordinaty
resources can be emp'oyed. I leave it to
the house then to judge how far those who,
in principle, give the enemy a right to ask
all, who, by decrying our resources, give
them confidence to advance every pretention,
by kindly infuiming them that, from our
inability to resist, that may extort whatever
they demand, are the true friends to their
country, or the enlightened advocates of
peace ?
The change which the Honourable Gen
tleman recommends, I fufped would be to
remove those diilinflions, and to sweep a
way those privileges which have raised the
hatred fend envy of France ; but the Ho
nourable Gentleman contends that the
French would be juftified in refilling to make
peace,becaufe Ireland ii not unanimous ; hut
would behaveconfideredtheMiniftersjuttificd
in refilling to ijinke peace, because La Van
dee was in a state of iufurreflion ? If in his
eyes thiÂ» would he an inefficient reason for
refufing to make peace with Frane', when
nearly one fourth of its inhabitants were
in a Hate of up a holtili:y against the ty
ranny under which they were opprefftd {
will he fay that it is reason for the perfc
vering humility of the enemy, that Ireland
it in a (late of danger, arising from the nt
â¢cflary exertion of vigour to refill the opera
tion of French principles diffused every
where with tueh afliduity, and in Ireland
with peculiar fucctfs ; circulated with "that
industry which they have ever (hewn to sup
plant, by their defolacing principles of liber
ty,' the real practical bleffingsof the BritiTh

Mr. LivirgÃon preftnted the petition of Han

Ireland, to purchase land in the north wcAirn
territory, and praying for attention from the
legislature. Referred to the committee who has
the land bill under consideration.
Mr. Thatcher, from the committee on poft

Mr. D. Foder, from the committee of claims,
made an unfavourable report on the petitions of

Also an unfavourable report on the petition of

were concurred in by the house.
Mai krnr, *>rÂ»m the committee to whom was
rrfolutioA proposing that perions
house tor the ptirpofe of reporting
Bs, should he admitted to take their
the bar ofthe house, reported it as
the opinion of theconroittee that tbe resolution
ought to be rijefled. This repnrt was referred
to the committee of the whole to whom ha*
been referred other prbpofitions foe amending*
the finding rules of tie house.
Mr. Harper, iroi* the committee of ways 501!
means, inliru&ed to ffiquire whe'her tr.y, and
if any, what alterations njrefTary in the
a<ft laying a duty on neinces for the (ale of
wines, and f-ret.'n spirit*. by retail repoitcdit
a* their opinion, that it *â â¢!! not Ue expedient to
make a. y alterations therein at the present
time. âConcurred in.
The fame gent'einan, from fame commit
tee, dated that the committee h .d receive 1 cer
tain information 011 the fuhjeft of the enrriage
duty, which led tlxm to believe an alteration
would be neceflary in that law. This opinion
was founded on a letter from the Supervisor of
S. Carolina- who Dated that one of the collat
ors of hit diflridt, from a failure of due pay
ment, had to ride foity miles to collect
Iwri' dollars ; for 4 which service, according
'o the penalty by law of if per cent, on per
form neglefling to pay tlveirduty at the pro >er
office, he only received half t dollar,and that ex
cept f.ime alteration was made in the law, no
colle&or would hold an office which fubjefled
him to such service. The committee, therefore,
proposed to alter the penalty of a - percent, to
50 percent, and reported the fallowing resolu
tion to the hoi-fc for adoption.
" Refolvcd, that the Committee of Ways
and Means have leave to bring in a bill for
amending the aft for laying a duty on car
riages for the conveyance of persons."
An agreement to this resolution wai ob
jected to, it was observed that the com
mittee of ways and means ought to have
dated the rcafons which induced them to
believe an alteration was neceflary in the
law ; that a single mftance of complaint
was not fufficicnt to induce a change ;that
though in this particular cafe, ihe officer
had to ride forty miles to colleCt the duty
in question, few similar cases could be pro
duced where fnch a jurney would be ne
cessary for the collection of so fmali a sum;
and that it would be imprudent to double
the penalty upon the whole United States,
because of a few cases of this fort.
A motion was firft made to commit thiÂ»
resolution to a committee of the whola,
which was negatived 41 to 3S. The que-
Jion was then taken upon agreeing to the
resolution, and it was negatived 45 to 38'
Mr. N. Smith, from the committee, to
whom it was referred to enquire into the
propriety ofmakingany alteration in the
Insolvent Law, reported ii to be their opin
ion, that the law ought to be so altered and
amended as to extend to persons imprifpn
ed in civil caufei at the suit of the United
Sates. Committed for to-morrow.
Mr. Kittera said, as some inconvenience
had lately been experienced in the examin
ation of witnefles before the house and its
committees he would propose a resolution
in order to remove thia inconvenience in fu
ture. It was to the following effedt :
" Resolved, that a committee he appoin
ted to enquire into the propriety of autho
rising the President of the Senate, [he Spea
ker of the house of Reprefentativea, or the
chairman of a committee of the whole, or the
chairman of a committee of either house, to
adminiftcr an oath or affirmation in any cafe
under inve(ligation, in which an oath or
affirmation may be neceflary, and that they
report by bill or otherwise."
The motion was agreed to, and a com
mittee of three appointed.
Mr. Harper moved that the nnfinifhed
bufinef* be podponcd, in order â¦o take up
the bill proposing an alteration in the law
itnpofing c-rtain (lamp duties, as it was nc
ctlfary to come to an early deeifion upon
that fobjefl, 3 months public notice being
neceflary to be given before the time at
which the law was to take effeft. The
Secretary of the Treasury, he said, was also
at this time, making out inftru&ions for
the supervisors, and waited the passing of
the law in question, beforehecould complete
them. As there had been a proposition for
a repeal of the law referred to the fame
committee of the whole, he supposed it
would be neceflary firft to dispose of that
htfire they could with proptiety go on to
make alterations in the law itfelf. He ho
pÂ«d, therefoie, this bufinefi wonldbe gone
into.
The motion was put and carried ; and
the House acoidingly resolved itfelf into
a committee of the who'c on this fubjett,
Mr. Dent in the chair ; when tile report
of the committee of ways and means on the
petition from citizens of Southampton,
Suflex and Prince George, in Virginia,
who prayed for a repeal of the law, having
been read, which dated, that it would be
inexpedient to repeal the fame,
Mr Harrifon called for the reading of
the petition itfelf ; which was read accor
dingly.
The question was then put, without de
bate, upon agreeing to the report of the
Committee of Ways aDd means, which was
negatived 47 to 37.
Mr. Tillinghast then called for a deeifion
upon the resolution which he proposed for
the adoption of the house, which had also
been referred to the fame Committee of the
whole. It was in the following words :
" Resolved, that a committee be appoin
ted to bring in a bill to repeal the adt for
laying a duty on damped vellum, parch
ment and paper."
The question was taken also, without de
bate and carried 49 to 36.
The committee then rose, and the house
took up the repott. The firft vote was con
curred in, and the Yeas and Naya were cal
led upon the last.
Mr. Harper moved to amend the refolu -
tion, by inserting inflcad of" a committee
be appointed," the comiittce Â»f wtys and
means be direÃeJ, See.â-Agreed.
A debate then ensued, which had not
long been continued, before Mr. Craik mo
ved to postpone the consideration of thii
qyedion till this day three weeks.

The Secretary com !udeÂ§ his letter in the follow
ing words: It is proper to add, that in a letter
from the American commiffioncri, dated the
29th July, 1797, they iVtimate, that K u except
some more cases of capture, under the orders of
17^5,f0r taking veieis loaded with provisions,
there is very little profpeft of any other be.ng
in a state to come before the coa.miflioners,
till the term of 18 months, from the commence
ment of their builnefs, (hall have expired. Eve
ryâ  caufc, in which the partirt were furni/hed
with the neceflTiry evidence, hid" been decided ;
and they truiled, that almoit every principle of
importance, or liable to contcft, had been fet

be agitated, if any should ever be of their
right to judge on cases not decided by the com
miffioneri of appeal, after the said term of 18

or ccmprel.enOve ftatcment can be made of the

the multiplicity of bufineft, which, in time of

AT a 'juncture wken the qucftion of
a Commercial Treaty -with France may soon
become ao oljcA of difcuflion, a workof this kind
becomes extremely vfctul to those eitiaens of the
United States, who may be defirons to enable them
fctves to view this fubje&, under its various af
pedb ; and they will have the fatisfadion to be
furniflied with the necessary data, to judge of the
â¢fefulnefsof this tranfadion.
This work is principally distinguished by the
sichnefsof the obftrva' ions, the pcrfpieuity of tho
ijlcas, and the mcdefty of the theory which 2t
contains. At Pars, a man of wit Â©bferved, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with nfeful produce. Il is addrcf
fed to the unfortunate La Fatetti, in letters,
which fugitive fo r m, the author who could only
devote a few weeks to this occupation, wai obliged
to adopt. Although circumflancis are in many
refpe&s different at the present day, from what
ihcy were in the year 1790, when these letters
were written, ytt it may be justly ftid,that so ma
ny absolute and permanent data still remain, lhaf
she judtcWs reader will not appreciate the work
less on that acoount ; on the contrary, m many of
the alterations, which have been ma Je, are the re

nations, cvÂ»?ry thing maybe expelled from the ef

than Great Britain to supply us with fevoral articles,
which the English author al.ots exclusively and forev

Per Insurance again (It Fiat, on Dwelling*

Philadelphia, in the United States.
I. Common lufurancei, o* hazard? of the firft I
elafs, will be undertaken at a premium of ahout â¢
half per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous <
rifques a larger pr<*n inm will be required, which <
will vaiy according to circnmftance*, seldom ex- <
eeeding one per cent, per anruro ; but in some in
ftar.eeÂ®. where the property irfmed is not only in 1
itfeif extra hazardous, but rendfred dill more so t
by the vicinity of extra hazardous buildings and i
occupations, the premium demanded will be raifcd <
according to circumstances- t
Hoifes and Ware Hcufes, the walls and parti j
tions of wfcich are wholly of stone or brick, wall
cuiiftru&ed, so as to b* guarded at well as may be
against fires from within, andiree from extra ha- (
sardeus buildings and Â©cccupatioirs in their neigh
borhood, will be deemed of the firft
class, and may be insured to their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not o r an extra
hazardous kind, in calks, bales, or packages de
pofi?ed in such buildings, to an zraouitt rot ex
ceeding 4000 dollars ; but if more than thisium
| is require J to.be infurcd in one tenement, an addi
tional premium will be required, in proportion to
1 circumstances.
11. Insurances will also be made on buildings and
; goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to the rifquc. But it js not easy to arrange these
under particular heads or classes, so as to deferibe
rach with the necessary accuracy. Each caf- must
therefore be decided upon according to the circum
flancesattending it ; and these circumftanees wili,
in general, appear from the description accompa
uy;ng tte application.
Buddings partly conftru&ed Â©f brick or stone,
are preferable to those wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the stile of building, how they are oc
cupied, how they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, and how c ccupied, are considerations to
be taken into vIEVv. And with refyeit tÂ« goods,
their tendÂ«ncy, whether from their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, c ther
to commence or to increafc an accidental fire, and
their Jiability in such state to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden andhafly removal, or to be sto
len in time of confafion and hurry, are all cir
cumstances ef weight ; and the premiums mud be
proportioned accordingly.
111. The following conditioot are to be under
flood by the parties .
xft. The lnfurance is net binding till the ftipu
lated premium be paid ; but it (hall be deemed ef
fectual from the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately
fjgned or not.
2d. Infurancs Â»3y be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, without further ex
pense* than the payment of the premium of the re
newed term, the t ircumftancs cf>nrinuing the fame
as they were nnderftood by the lufunrs at the time
theiormcr insurance was ma 'e ; hut the paymtnt
â¢f thf ; rfcmium is eflential to such renewal ; and
if the party i fured fuffers any time to elapfc after
the expintion of the former insurance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
during such time ; nor can the insurance be renew
ed on the former policy but by computing the
comm nccment of the renewal from the expiration
of the former insurance. The fubjeil of insur
