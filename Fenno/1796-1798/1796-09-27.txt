PAIN 3OF MEMORY.]
Down in yon glade, befidetHat glassy pool,
There stands, and long has stood, the village school;
k " â¢Hark ', the gay murm'rings ef the sportive tram,
, Freed from restraint that gambol o'er the plain ;
Lift their ftirill voices, and their burits of gl=Â«,
Will future years recal their extacy ?
'Perchance some one, hereaftrc, of the band,
From the brown summit of tlfat jetting land,
Shall eye the well-known spot, the felf fame scene,
And the thin spire that peeps those groves between ;
Sjhill mark the peasant plodding as before,
And.the trim house-wise at the cottage door ;
Shall hear the pausing bell's pathetic toll,
Borne on the gale, announce the parting foulâ
Of some oid friend, who to his childhood kind,
T'repar'd the kite and ftream'd it to the wind ;
Some busy dame, for cakes and tuflards known,
Who gave him credit when hit pence were gone ;
Some truant plough-boy, toil,
Toin'd him to seize the tempting orchard's spoil |
Or in dtfpite of peril, spread thefnare,
As thro' the thicket pafs'd the nightly hare j
Then shall he think on all the woes of life,
His thankiefs children, or his faithlefn wife,
His fortune willed, or his"wifiiet croft,
His tender fvrother, sister, parents loft,
Tiliev'ry oWjefl finking intoihade,
He sigh, and call oblivion to his aid.
'1 he buxom lass who late feture from harm,
With gay importance buftledthro' the farm ;
Tended her dairy at the break of dawn,
Or fed jier circling poultry on the lawn 5 _ I
O'er the wafh'd Ik.or the cleanly find let fall,
And brdfn'd theunfeemly cobweb from the wall,?
Who in the hay-time met the lusty throng,
And \v:th her ihare of labour jom'd her song,
To the faint reapers bore the humming' ale,
Or jok'd the threOier leaning on his flail *
By vain ambition Led at leivjth to town,
In quest of fortune, and fuppos'd renown,
If there, the vhftim of some wofthlefs rake,
She chance its sickly pleasures to partake,
Mix'd with the pamper'd crowds,.looks difclaifri
The smile of virtue and the blush of Ihaaie i
Will fee not oft regrrrttlsThearf ji
When sport and freedonyiail'd the approach of May,
And Â« rural pair beguil'd the hour,
vV ith evening dance beneath the n.oon-light bow'r.
Or to her fadfaie left, condemtt'd to rove
The lawless paths of desultory love;
Will not her tortur'd bofam throb the more,
Whene'er ihe thinks on what (he was before,
And finds recoiling from the insidious joy
A secret canker ev'ry rose destroy.
While all that memory's forcei y can difpeVife
Shall add new pangs to loss of innocence.

Mr. Fenno,
WE often fee in the papers accounts of the enor
mous expences attending cleftlons in England, and
Â©ur,indignation is jullly excited at reading the leci
tals. While we execra'e the bribeYy and corruption,
which is there so (hamelefsly pra&iled ; we eo'mlgn
the corrupters to infamy, but the -corrupted, the peo
ple who thus barter their rights and privileges for a
mess of pottage' generally escape censure. There
is one cireumdaace in this business which wants ex
planation ; people are puzzled Jo account /arJLJie '
rmptnruj atleiiaifig'TÃTsÃaTe" traffic for the fuffraÂ» 1
ges of the people, when they consider that no coun- :
try in the world Las fever.. 1 laws againd bribery and
corruption at elections, than Great-Britain. Let 1
, U3 turn our attention to what paflej under our own '
experience, and fee whether the difficulty cannot be
solved. I
In England the modes adopted for evading the 1
laws are infinitely various, and generally fuceefsful. <
The. Candidates on such occaficns are almott every
wfcere- present, and a perpetual smile or grin enli- i
vens their coufitertanees ; they are " bail fellow
â¢well mef' "with every man woman and child, and 1
are the bed nafured creatures in the world till elec
lioÃ is everâthey pay off small debts, fubferibe to s
every charitable inflitntion, repair churches, giiq a
organs, replenish libraries, dilhibute books, pic- i

From the Augusta Chronicle. 11
Mr. Smith, 1
I HEAR Mr. Somebody ha 3 given you the 1
trouble of publilhing a Jmer againlt the proposi
tion for a convention, &c. &c. n
And I have heard* that his flippancy has given Â°
such offence to some of your fubfciibers, that they 1'
threaten to withdraw their names.
But is not this too precipitate ? Such withdraw- e
ing is a declaration for laying under restraint the
press, -which Jhould be free. And if a people take
the trouble ot forging their own chains, do the,y
nat inside the provHice of /mprudeive ? Whenever
f) a people commit this tiefpafs, they are fute to pay 0
Jmart-meney, one day or other. f'
This is not meant in excuse for this Somebody's "
attempt. Of that, reports are not very mush in
its favor. o
The proportion was thought to bÂ« very inoffen
five. Neither was it founded on abftirdities. The tl
impofObility of persuading all men to think alike, P
was iiot attempted. The principal obje& Was, by "
frequent collision, to wear off that which
ha 3 often wounded, where no wottud. should be
given : And to change into the friendly warmth
of brotherly love, that eoldnefs which often freezes
up the milk of human kindnefn, so honorable in *
-- man, and so essential in a Chrittian. * f {
d Whether endeavors to promote fucli dispositions;
i- or attempts, like that of Somebody, to prevent
1, them, be molt worthy of public approbation, the
n public will ealily determine. F
1. Although a free press fnould be preferred '; yet
a there it a great difference between frjh and licen- J 1
e tioui. V
Every mader of a press is supposed to possess
e the a. fiwim niiUn. â¢ â  When pieces are
. calculated to create discord ; to bear falfe witness F
. againlt a neighbor; to corrupt youth, and the un
-1 wary, or tend, generally, to loosen moral ofiliga- A
t tions.âin all such eases the matter's veto may be A
i happily applied. ' SI
But, at any rate, they would do well to confide*
that the publicatian of such a piece, may and pro- 10
hably wiii, do an injury, for which uo reconape.Â»ce
can ever be made. va
This, though, is thrown out only as a him ;
and not obtruded as advice. re

of nominating suitable cdara&ers to he submitted nowf
to our fellow citizens for their fuffrage at the en
"filing elediÂ»n ; it appears but reasonable and pro- "'P
pcr,Â°that the bufmefs, so far as it hath been acted ou
'upon, should be laid before the citizens, generally, ~ de* i
for their information, that they may thereby .have h
time and a-i opportunity of conlidering the charac- '
4crÂ» of the several proposed candidates, and there- I'y 1
from feleft those men who are mod efleemed for an '
their wisdom, jvittue, and political knowledge in Â£ ent
government affaiis ; as well as the propriety of fe- man '
kiting Counsellors and Common Council men, for eer
making ordinances and bye laws to regulate the po
lice of this city. _
At this lall meeting (at Mr, Little's school) a
printed ticket, or lift of names, was offered to the r:!
gentlemen present, from which it was prepofed (at
a subsequent meeting to be called for the purpose) 3f(
to fclett a ticket to be supported by all the gentle-
men then present, at the ensuing ele&ion, for the
following offices, viz.
Governor.
A Member of Congress.
A Senator. teer
Six Members of Assembly, j jot|
Twelve feleft Counsellors.
Twenty Common Councilmen.
The propriety of the chara&ers contained in this
lift, to fill some of the important stations intended |^ r
for ihem, are so felf evident that they need no com-
raent : it is only withed that a choice had been sub- npr
mitted.to the meeting, as well in that of Governor
and Member of Congress, as in the several ttations and
v of less importance ; for though we have heard of , )nd
no opposition to the Governor ele&, zi Governor, d ,
v>e have heard of other candidates for Congress ; '

By captain JÂ®hnfon, in thefhip Nancy, 42 days j yj
from Lisbon, we have advice of the arrival of tlie j w
Brazil fleet there, S.ith property to an isrimeuf j ' at
value. J w
We have beÂ«n favoured, with tlie following e:;- I
tvaÂ£t of a letter, frtm an American in Lisbon, tc 1 , a
his brother in this city, dated I t (
" Lisbon, August u, 1796. w
" Ever, fmce 1 have been here,, there has beeu the -j
grcf.teft -appearance of a rupture between Spain I [ a
and England. It hes at length taken place : Spain |y,
has (hut its ports against Englandj and it was Ve-J w
ported yesterday, and currently believed, that a t [
part of the Spanish fleet had failed in conjunction q
with the French-âtheir destination unknown.
" The French have keen uniformly fuccefsful in j 0
Italy ; and the present appearance is, that the Pope t ;
will be dethroned, or will be forced t<) make peace ! {]
with the French upon Â»heir own terms. Indeed, a
they have already levied heavy contributions upon I
several of his provinces, and made a demand upon j t .
them of 20,000,000 florins. On the Rhine, they
, are equally fucCefsful. If this campaign ends as a
fuccefsfully as it has begun, the French will have no t
enemy in Europe that will belble to contend with {
them. | {
" The Portuguese are in expeAation of a viGt t
from them through the territories of Spain. In |,
consequence, the greatest exertions arf making to
raise an army of 50,000 men, to march to their
frontiers, by the firit of Odtober."
Extradt of a letter from a mercantile house in Lif-]
bon, to his friend in this city, dated the Ilthl
of August.
"The political situAtion of Portugal becomes I
â veiy critical, finee it is no longer to be doubted,
that WAR will immediately take place been Eng
land and Spa n. A Spanifti fqiudron failed on the 1
4th inilant from Cadiz, in company with the French
â vessels of war which have been so long there, ugder
the command of admiral Richery. It is said also, i
that the French have demanded a passage through j
Spain, for 50,000 troops, nominally destined against j
Gibraltar."
