under the said article (which so far asthe fa.iie de

Exjrail from the said article,
" Whereas it is alledged by divers BrkiJh mer

" this provision is to extend to such losses only as
" have been occasioned by the lawful impediments
" aforefaid, and is not to extend to losses.occasion

that the several claims be so lljted, and support

the neceffityof obtaining further information, or ad

the general agent ihinks it hi> duty to add, (for the

Jr.ifter, was captured by the pilot boat De
mocrat, in a few hours 'after leaving the isl
and of St. Thomas's. This vessel was load
ed with doffee and cotton at Surinam, and
bound so Boston, since condemned.âCapt.
Seward was kept a prisoner on hoard the
privatter Democrat, for fix days after her
arrival, and was it not for the very spirited
exertions used by some American captains
and others, he would not even then have ob
tained his' liberty.
Captured and brought into port, and since
condemned, the- fchr. Delight, of Penob
fcott, Mark Hatch, matter, bound from
Barbadoes to fomeport in the United States,
the captain and crew turned on shore at St.
John's, destitute of both money and cjoathes,
being pillaged.
Captured and brought into port, and con- â 
demned, by the privateer Vengeance, the
Brig Two Sifters of Baltimore, capt. Hub
bard, bound from Montferrat to the island
of Thoma3, the captain plundered of his
wearing apparel, and every other necessary
belonging to himfelf and crew.
Captured and bro't into port, the barque
Susan of Biddeford, Smith, master,
bound from St. Vincents to North Carolina.
Capt. Smith and his crew turned on shore
(though they solicited much, without effÂ°Â£l,
to be left in the barque) where they remain
ed at the town of St* John's, at a very hea
vy expence to wait the iflue of the barque's
tryal at Guadaloupe, which finally arrived
about the middle of May. Verdidt of the
Trench tribunal, cargo condemned, vefTel
cleared, but the barque's register, sea letter,
and all her other papers, destroyed, or made
away with, by the captors, and the vefTel so
much pillaged by them, as not to be in a
state to return to the continent.
Capt. Smith applied to Mr. Paris the
French marine agent at Porto Rico, to afTril
him to put the barque in such a condition as
would enable him to return in her to Bidde
ford, but without any redress or effect ;
capt. Smith was therefore neceflitated to
purchase the American schooner Delight,
which was condemned, in the purchase of
which he was joined by capt. Strong, and five
or fix different captured American masters
and mates, being the only alternative they
had left to return to America.
Brought into the port of St. John's by a
French privateer, the mate and crew of a
schooner belonging to Boston, whom they
turned on shore without a second shirt or
jacket, or a single dollar in his pockets.
This schooner, name forgotten, was owned
at Boston, and commanded by captain Dtin-
Itendorff, loaded at Tobago, and bound to
Bostonâcleared.
Brought into port, by the privateer Tri
umphant, the brig , of Baltimore, John
Fry, master, bound from Baltimore to St.
Bartholomews. After several days deten
tion, and loaded with innumerable expen
ces, he was with difficulty cleared, but on
a ftipuhted condition of entering into a
Written obligation, to acquit the owner and
captain of the privateer from all costs and
damages.
Capt. Williams, of the fchr. , be
longing to Norfolk, and his people, were
brought to St." John's by the privateer Ven
geance, and turned on shore without a dol
. lar in their pockets. They sent the schooner
for trial to St. Domitfgo, where she was
soon condemned, under a pretext of her not
having either register or sea letter, which
the captain of the privateer was base enough
to del-toy ot conceal.
Takon by the privateer brig Vengeance, and
since condemned, the Ihip William, of Portland,
RfcbrrtStrong master, boond from St.K:ttsto
Portland. In a few nights after theeap'ureol
faitl ship, the mate of her, and one Tailor and
the cabin bey, whom the privateer permitted
t* remain onboard, took an opportunity, whil<
the French prize master and eight Frenchmen
ere napping, or off their guard, to rife mi
them and retake thelhip. *ln theconflifl, whit k

brig Cries entirely of her Ihrowds and part of
her running rigging and spars, with which tl*ey

Ceres's condemnation had not arrived when the
ship Mount Vernon left Porto Rico.

Captured and brought in by the l'Â£ipcig!e
privateer, the ftlip Kitty; belonging to Mr.
Coppinger of Philadelphia, bound from the
Isle of France to laid port, loaded with coffee,
sugar, cotton, indigo and bale goods.
Captain M'Fherfon and Mr. Cox, the super
cargo of the above ship were eonfined on board
without even having permission to converse or
fee a single individual diredlly or indiredlly,
or to corrcfpond with the Ihore by letter ; they
at length found means by the aid of Mr. Bayly
an interpreter to have a ltrong or urgent remon
strance l'ating their grievances, drawn up, and
presented to the Govtrnor don Kaytnundo de
Castro, but to which his excellency never re
turned an answer, and finally when the island
was beliegcd by the Britilh, they were taken
from on Board the Ihip, with the crew and
I clcfely confined in prison, where they yet lan
guifli without any profpedl of being liberated,
S uulefs by the interference of the executive of
! their country. Five seamen of the above ship
1 Kitty, all citizens of America and with protec
tions in their pockets, were put on board the
Spanish frigate Juno, to be sent to the Havan
nah, and treated as linglifh prisoners of war ;
this extraordinary circumstance happened on
the morning of the day, on which the ship
Mount Vernon was to fail, therefore no time
was to be lolt to rescue those poor fellows from
such a dreadful situation; a strong and urgent
representation was made in their favour by
some American captains and others, that they
might be put on board rhe Ihip Mount Vernon,
which was at length granted, but not until the
very inltant that the Ihip Mount Vernon was
' weighing anchor, vdien the poor fellows arri
ved from on board a guard boat troin the Span
ish frigate J jno. . .
Some days previous to the ship Mount Ver
non leaving Porto Rico, there were thirteen
American tailors brought to the town of St.
i John's, under a guard of soldiers. from the
l weft end of the island, and put into close prison
where there were no less than 50 negroes con
, fined. Those men wiere all American citizens
and had each of them a proteaion, being part
of the crews belonging to the brig Induftiy of
1 Boston, Joseph Ryder master, bound from De
marara to Boston, and ot the schooner Betiey,
; W. Sturges from Trinidad, and the ship In
, duftry, Robert Oram mailer, of Portsmouth
(Newhampfhire,) all taken by a privateer and
f- carried into Cape Rook.
IFire American captains being made acquainted
with the dreadful iituation that ihefe poor fel
> â¢ lows were in, dofely confined in afmall cell, and
the weather then extremely sultry, presented a
remonstrance to the governor for their liberation,
which was granted, after their being eonfined in a
loathsome prison nine days, but on condition that
1 they would pay the goal fees and that they Ihould
take them on board their different veiicls off the
â¢ Island. .
These thirteen mariners all agree in their differ
ent accounts of what Captain IVierrihew heard re
ported before, at the town of St* Johns, that the
French privateers had % taken within a ihort time
} several other American vessels and brought them
into the different ports of the south and weft part
of the Island of Porto Rico. -Some of the captains
to the number of five or fix as well as the crews of
those vessels took their passage in a Danilh barque
' bound to St. Croix from CapeÃooke, it being the
" best opportunity that presented for them to
- return home after losing their vessels.
1 Captain Merrihew cannot conclude his recital
without mentioning a matter that has> happened to
1 him and the other American vessels at the port of
1 St. Jehr.s, during the early part of the ficge of that
town, by the Britilh, on which he .will not pre
' tend to comment, but leave it to an impartial pub
lic tÂ®draw what inference they think proper irom
e so extraordinary a circumstance.
On the fourth or [fifth day of the liege the Eri
" tilh brought leveral mortars to bear on,the town,
" and on the (hipping in the harbour, which of con
r â¢ fcquence induced the (hipping for tteir prefervati
,B I on to remove to a greater difttnee round a point
â¢ of land, in performing which as is always cuftoma
-1 ry, five or fix American vessels then ia port hoilted
their colours, to prevent the Briuib firing or annoy*
" ing them while they were thus aiixiowllj employed
in removing their vessels to a place of lafcty. ihe
d neceflity ofhoifting their American colours was e-
l f vident as the French prize master of the American
o (hip Kitty of Philapdphia was nearly inflrumental

in Sufjlance of Mr. Harper's Speech on thi
of quejiion of permitting Merchants Jhips tt
ul arm for defence in the IVfl-India trade,
M Mr. Harper observed, that it did no'
er seem to him necessary for members to pre
r * face their otfervations in that House witl
VT ' accounts of themselves, or declarations abou
âºh ! their motivesâmuch less could it be necef
g- ; fary to talk about the motives of othe
rs 1 people. He believed that gentlemen vver
*Â° j for the moll part, far better known to other
v " | than to themselves, and as for their motives
they would bell be judged of by the natur
â¢ * land tendency of^heiraclions. He woidi
i therefore, as he had alwÃy before endeavour
cd to do, avoid the example of gentlemen i
4
this refpeft, ;:;id fhouJd content lumfelf 1 ffi
with dating his own ar.d endeavour- j to
ing to controvert those of gentlemen who- as
opposed him, without faying any thing about ef
his motives or theirs. * t' l
He could have wished that other gentle- in
tnen had acted thus. They had however &
chosen to pursue a very different course. 1
They had constantly and loudly attributed th
to him and other gentlemen who thought aj
with him, the very worst of motives, a de
sire to bring their country into war, and this 0
l I:i contradiftion to their express and repeat- h;
ed disavowal of such intentions. When he ei
and gentlemen with whom he agreed, had
made-the most solemn afleveraticms, that it hi
was their whole desire to preserve the peace tc
of this country, in every manner confident w
with itstfue interests, and that they advised fc
certain'meafures, because they, iathe best of w
their judgment, thought them best calcula- ir
ted to produce this eneft ; they had been P
repeatedly told, though not always with the di
fame rudentfs, that they were not believed, c;
The accusation of intending to draw the it
country into war, had been extended to all
who differed in sentiment with certain gen- a:
tlemen, and every measure which they did k
not like, was imputed to this intention.â o
The charge had been extended to the Exe- n
cutive ; and it had been said both on that h
floor and eifewhere, that proofs of this hof- n
tile intention were to be found even in the ti
pacific measures which he had resolved to p
pursue. d
On this head Mr. H. said, he did not o
know how gentlemen were to be cured of ti
their incredulity ; how did he know whe- a
ther it was desirable that they should be cu- tl
red : He certainly should take no further t
pains to do so. Of one thing, however, he 0
could assure gentlemenâthat the fear of t
their cenfur* on his motives, or the desire v
of averting it, should never induce him, in t
any degree, to alter his conduft: It was v
the public good he fought, and the public t
aÂ»':eem, in addition to his own, was the re- e
ward he de fired. As to the good opinion of
certain gentlemen, if it came in his way he c
should not rejeft it ; but he could not fay d
that he would go out of his way to obtain 1 t
it. If, therefore, it was an effeft on him j a
they meant to produce, they might spare 1 c
themselves the trouble in future. If it was â  a
an effeft on the public ; still their labours e
would not effeft him ; for he was very wil- : a
ling to let his motives be laid before the pub- i c
lie, on his own sincerity, weighed against a
the accusations of those gentlemen. j c
He had been led into these remarks, not
only by the course conftaqfcly pursued by 1 1
gentlemen in general, but by the aflertion I <â 
of the gentleman last npâfrom Maryland , 1
(Mr. Smith). That this motion for ex- j
cepting the Weft India trade from the pro- '<
hibition to arm for defence, was a motion for j 1
peace or war. In this opinion he could not J
agree. He was persuaded, and he should f
endeavour to shew that the right of arming \ \
merchants (hips for defence in the Weft In- 1
dia trade, might be so regulated and re- <
ftrifted, as to become in no degree dange
. rous to the peace "of this country. '
i He said the right of arming for defence ; 1
for he took this to be a right inherent by ;
the law of nations, in every neutral State.
He had not, he confefled, made researches
' into the law of riations on this point, but the
! general course of his reading had led to this
1 conclusion. It was also confirmed by histo
ry and the praftice of neutral States, whose
1 merchants (hips did very frequently fail
j armed in time of war. It was a natural
j right to carry arms for defcece, as much on
, the water as on the land. The offence, lay
1 in either cafe, hot in the arming, but in the
c improper use of the arms. If on a
' journey should carry arms for his defence
against robbers, this would he proper ; but
. should he use them to rob himfelf, be be
- comes punishable as a felonâSo it is at sea.
c The arms may be carried, and may be
e used properly. If used improperly, pun
t ifhment ensues. This he had moreover un
s derftood to be the result of the best legal
>f opinions in this country ; and indeed it had
e not been denied.
~ It must, however, be admitted, that the
abuse of this right was far more easy, and
il far more dangerous, at sea, than ou land : It
3 was therefore proper to lay it under much
1 stronger reftriftions ; and some nations had
1 thought fit to reftrift it altogether. Whe
ther we should do so in the present circum
ii fiances, was the question. This question
he would repeat, was riot about the giving
of a right, but about the reftrifting or tak
ing away entirely of one which already ex
i_ ifted.
it When this proposition was firft brought
1- forward by his colleague, it was presented
in the most general and abftraft form- It
'J was "to regulate the arming of mercahnts
lc (hips for defence." Afterwards by the con
sent of the mover it had been exp#.Ted dis
h ferently : "To reftrift the arming of mer
chants (hips for defence, to particular cases."
A gentleman from Connefticut (Mr. Coit)
J had moved to amend it so as to read '? to re
1. ftrift the arming of merchants (li:p% &c.
r to the trade to the East Indies and the Me
" diterranean." It had then been moved to
insert before the word." Indies" the words
:)t stand "to reftrift the arming of merchants
:d fliips, &c. to the trade of the East and Weft
Indies, and the Mediterranean." That was
the motion then under difcufTan. The
question was whether merchants ships enga
lo ged in the Weft India trade should be pre
vented entirely- from arming for defence ?
ft And this the gentleman from Maryland had
c- .declared to be a question of peace or war.
th But how, he would a fie, was it a question
ut of peace or war ? Was it not prafticable to
:f- leave the merchants possessed of this right,
er but under such regulations and reftriftions as
re would take away the danger of abuse ?âOr
â rs if abuses should happen, would save the
â % nation from refponflbility ; would take away
re cause of offence from other nations ; He
lid believed it was prafticable, ar.d he should
ir- n6w'endeavour to shew it. The question]
in had indeed been brought forward in its ab-'
ffrjft form i in this form it was proper full i c;
to difcufsit. The modifications would come 1 a*
dfitruardf, when it should affame the form I a
ef a bill. Gentlemen- had complained of jfa
this mode, and called for the modifications
in the firft instance; but tlicy had them- at
selves proved, that this mod.; was proper.-: j c.<
They had not only proved by the tenor oÂ£ 119
their opposition that they meant to vote Ibi
against the measure under any poffiblc modi- I o
fication ; but liacf expressly declared it.â J ai
One gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Giles) I tc
had even declared that he would vote againfl | j'
every proposition on the table. Why then Iti
spend time in modifying a measure, which a!
however modified, gentlemen were resolved I ci
to oppose. ? The â¢ proper way was, to fee J it
whether it could be carried in iLs general h
form, and let the modification Cornc after- II
wards. Though, however, he thought it n;
improper to propose any modification at c;
present, he would tell gentlemen, and en- ai
deavour to (hew the Committee, how, In his I
opinion, it might be modified so as to strip a
it of all its dangers. b
There were, he (aid, three kinds cf trade
as between us and France. There was one c
kind prohibited either by treaties or the law t
of nations, one kind in dispute, and one kind I tl
neither prohibited nor in dispute. To this j v
last kind the right might be, and in his opi- I ti
nion ought to be, reftrifted. These reftric- I o
tions (hould be exprefled in the law, and in | i
precise inftruftions, and heavy penalties, un- I F
der good security, should be exacted for the I j'
observance of these inftruftions. Thus as I 0
the inftruftions would be confined wholly to I g
a trade, neither prohibited nor in dispute, I t
they could not be complained of; and if J v
they were infringed, it would not be the aft j <j
of the nation. The nation would have only I d
to disavow the aft, and (hew the inftruftions 11
whereby it was forbidden ; it then became I v
the private aft of parties, for which they j t
were punifliable, but the nation not bound | I
'to answer. This must. be admitted by all, | t
especially oy those gentlemen who contend I r
that the French Government is not ac- j c
countable for the hoftije afts in the Weft Tn- I h
dies, though avowedly founded on one of I V
I their decrees, and done bv their public and I f
! acknowledged agents, {f, under these cir- 11
â  cumftances, the French Government b? not I r
1 answerable for these afts, because it has not I '
especially authorized them, how, he would I Â£
j ask, could the American Government be ac- j c
1 countable for afts done- not only without its j 1
authority, but against its express and public I t
â  orders ? For afts, which instead of being I 1
! able*to avow, should it think fit, as the I 1
! French Government do- with' refpeft to the I â 
j depredations in the Weft Indies, it would 1
be bound topunifh. I 1
He would exemplify this general position I 1
1 as to th? manner of modifying this measure, I i
by some particular cases : not in order to j 1
point out all the modifications whereof it was j '
susceptible, or to declare that he would sup- j <
I port all that he fhonld mention ; but to (hew I >
how it might be modified so as to remove j '
every objeftion. j
111 the firft place Britain exercifcd the'right I '
of taking the goods of her enemies if found 1
on board of our (hips. This France ailed- j
ged was aright given to the Engliilibyour I
treaty with them, and that (he also. tad I
; become intitled to it. She therefore decla- I
: red that (he would take the goods of her e- I
nemies whenever (he could find them in our j
. (hips. Tnispoint we do not concede ; but
â¢ neither do we mean to resist the right by j
[ force. We intend to ttegociate, and per
[ haps to yield it if found expedient. It j
[ would therefore be improper, and contrary |
- to the spirit of this negociation to permit 1
: our vefTels to arm in this trade ; and confe- I
1 quently every veflel whichftiall take onboard j
: goods the prope'rty of the enemies of France
: must be prevented from arming. Every vef
. fel before (lie arms must give fufficient proof j
, that (lie has no such goods on board, and
; fufficient security not to take them.
So also asto contraband aboutwhich there
. is a point in dispute between us and Franc; I
1 which we mean to fettle by negociation.â I
1 The French treaty limits the contraband j
lift. In the British it is more extended, and I
; the French declare that they will extend it I
1 in the fame manner. Here is a dispute which
t like the former, we mean to fettle if possible I
j by negociation. We must not therefore 1
i permit oif citizens to contest it by arms ;
- and accordingly no veflel (hould be permit- I
. ted to armwithout proving that (he had none j
1 of those articles on board, and giving fecu- I
t rity to take noue. If (he did so, it would I
- be contrary to her inftruftions Scat her own I
- ri(k. The bonds would be forfeited, the aft I
disapproved, and the. nation saved from all I
t refponflbility.
i The fame observations, he said, would I
t apply to the cafe of a place blockaded or be- I
s sieged. By the Laws of Nations provisions I
- could not be carried to a blockaded or be- I
fiegedplace. What wouldconftituteafiegecr I
â¢- blockadewasaqueftionoftheLawofNations;
" but the ejeiftence of thefiegeor blockade must
) in the firft jnftance be notified to neutrals by
:- the party forming it. It could be known
:. in no other manner : for the neutrals must
be well acquainted with the circUmstances,
o and the besieged party would not teftify a
[s gainst themselves- Indeed acefs could not
n be had to them, and of course their opinion
:s could not he known. The besiegers must
ft therefore make the declaration in the firft
is instance, and neutrals must believe it. Whe
le ther falfe or true becomes afterwards a quef
l- tion in the Courts of Admiralty which the
e- French authority there has declared to be '
? in this state. The truth of this declaration
id will be a matter of controversy when any of
ourveflelsfliallbe taken in the attempt to enter
n those ports peaceably: but in the mean time
to they must not be allowed to attempt to en
t, ter by force. They must be prohibited in
as the fame manner as if the place were decla
)r red by the commander of a squadron to be
le in a state of blocade. At least, Mr. har
ly per said, this appeared to him to be pro
le per according to this present view of the
Id point. He might hereafter think otherwise
>n for his mind was not fully made up. But
b-' proper cr not, which was watter of future
cyifideAtibn," it was certaiafy pra&icable,
and if done would Cave the government from
any responsibility : a'nd that waS fufficicnt
for the present purpose.
These modilications, Mr. Harper said,
and as many more as might be thought nc
ceffary, it wftuld be practicable to introduce
iijto a The provifione of this bill would
be digested into'aTett o'f Tnft'ru&ion- find"
owners of veffeb applying for permission to
arnvdefeniivety, would be obliged to conform
|to the-law, and to give large bonds with fuf
ficient security for conforming to the inflec
tions. Resolves by way of indictment, might
also be added for matters of veflels who ftrould
contravene the inftru&ions.# If they flifculd
dill be contravened, the government would
have notlting ta do but disavow the act,
(hew the inftruftlons, and lay to -tie other
nation, puiiilh thefi persons if
catch them, they havc.djfobeycd our orders,
and if they -.come here we will punish fliem,
In the mean time wc-wittforfeit.LK;'r bonds:''
and thus all jnftifiable cause of offence would
be taken away.
He said " juftifiable cause of offence" be- '
caafe it was and always would be impossible
to take away pretexts of war from a natfen Â»
that has resolved on it. Such pretexts it
was well known from the history of "all na
tions and ages, had never been wanting when
one power was resolved to attack another.
All that could be done by a state deSrous of
peace was to avoid real cause of offence,
juftifiable cause of quarrel. This mtift be
our conduft. We mull avoid juftifiable
ground of complaint andoffence : this would
be done by,the measures recommended ; and
we could do no more. If France were so
determined on a quarrel as to attack us un-
der so flirnzy a pretence, (he wo aid. .find "b- *
thers were we to deprive her of this. War'
we' (hould have, if.war was her desire ; and
the; only possible chance of avoiding it, W6flld_
be by letting her fee that it was not her in- .
tereft. Mr. Harper was not afraid to fro-'
nounce the word war. He was neither afraid 1
of the thing, nor alarmed at the found ; and
he could conceive eaftly of circuraftancea -in
>vhich all the intereftsofthiscountry would Call
for war. Those circun-ftacces he did not
believe now to exist. He believed they
might be averted ; and that to adopt this
measure would strongly tendto produce that
effe&. Much had been, said about a clamor,
of war which had on former occasions been
raised. If such a clamour had been raised
the justice would be done him to acknow
ledge that he had never assisted it. He had
never resorted to the alarm of war. It was
an event which he had never apprehended,
nor did he now apprehend it. It was an e
vent always possible, and for which every
country ought to be prepared ; and this con
stant ftateof preparation was thebeft means
of averting it ; which was not to be done by
temporizing measures- A country which
acts justly towards others, and (hews a desire
of peace, and at the fame time a refolutio'n
to defend itfelf, will always be the most fafe
fiom injury and aggression.

FRIDAY, JUNE 9.
A member from Maflachufetts (Mr. Ihi

his feat. I
The bill to prevent Americans from pri- I w
vateering under a foreign flag, underwent a I ir
trifling amendment and pafled. I te
Mr. Blount laid on the table a refolu- I
, tion, to request the Erefident to cause.to be I Â£

Mr. Nicholas moved â  that for the re-1
mainder of the feff.on the House do meet I
at 10 o'clock.âNegatived 37 to 4s. I g
The House then went into a committee 1 c
of the whole on the state of the union, Mr. I g
Dent in the chair.
Mr. Davton brought forward the amend- r
iricnt to Mr. Smith's sth resolution of which d
he gave notice yesterday, viz. that merchant- I 0
men should be authorized to arm under certain \
regulations, &c- If the resolution, he ob
served, as it now flood, viz. to rejlria the r
arming, &c. should carry, a bill be brought I 1
in, and that bill fall through either in the r
House or Senate, it would eftabliih a gene- S
ral principle, that the merchants have a right t
to arm. This was a dangerous principle 1
and might involve us in difficulties ; under 11
~ this impreflion he declared he should not J
vote for unlefs this amendment I
prevailed, f 1
Mr. Dana conceived, that the suggestion 1
01 the gentleman last up, went, by implica- I <
tion, to a cenfurc of the conduft of the Pre- I
fident, who, without a law, had authorised J
the arming of vessels bound to the East In- 1
dies and the Mediterranean.
Mr. Dayton was of opinion that the re- I
verse of what the last member had stated was I
the fair indu&ion. By faying now that I
the "right of arming ought to be reftr-icted to I
the cases of }he Mediterranean and Weft I
luditfs, the House in faft approved the con
duft of the Executive in this refpeft.
Mr. Venable cspreffed himfelf of the J
opinion of the member last up.
Thfe amendment of Mr. Dayton was car- I
ried, 51 members riling in the affirmative. I
, Mr. Smith (Ch.) laid he understood
the words 'â¢ authorised," &c. not as giv- I
, n c- right to the merchants, which he j
. ftiU ipfifted they had without, but as recog
nizing the right, as treaties often recognize
particular pointijof the laws of nations, which I
they cannot be faid'toÂ«ftabli(h.

aalendtd, and it .was loft. 37 to 45.
Mr. Blount offered .refol'JtionH to the

required at the present crifts. â  was
Mr. Smith (S. C.) had some doubts the 1

The Chairman declared Mr. Blount's re- witl
gu'arly before the committee.. was
t Mr. Harper declared he (hould vote for post
: these resolutions as part df the system of de- ther
1 fence. now
| Mr. Blount did not care whether they thei
were voted for as a part of the fyftera or the refe
I whole, provided they were carried. It had his 1
: been said by the member from who to r
c brought forward the firing of resolutions, j mer
* on a former occasion, that those who were ! did
againft his proportions wera unwilling to refc
place the country in a state of defence. But to I
he believed the suggestion was perfectly un- I
founded. Jror his own part he was as Vvil- tior
ling to place the country in a state of defence the
s as any member, but he differed from, some ter
about the means. The resolutions he bro't the
forward, in liis opinion, took in the proper I
means, and if they were adopted, he con- den
ceived the House would have done their du- fuc'
ty. He was against those means of defence, Ho
which hazarded our peace, and might be a fori
bar in the way of an accommodation. ded
Mr. Smith (S. C.) said he should not oug
oppose the propositions of the gentleman par
*" from North Carolina ; but they appeared to the
" him calculated to do little or nO good. The it n
principal objett of the call of Congress he age
eonceived to be to take measures for the difi
proteftion of our commerce, and of course j
of our revenue which depended on it ; this adj
'g could not be effeÂ£tcd by those resolutions. ciri
' s They could, however, do no harmâwould ch;
P> occasion no expence or trouble but that of to
er palling them into law.; they would require tht
no additional revenue, but they afforded no I
remedy to the evils complained of. Those tio
N > measures which could afford efficient defence j
-1- jhe was sorry to fay were opposed on the mi
5 beaten ground of expence. For his part, !no
in j when the security of his country's commerce thi
L ' e I and revenue required that expence, Jie should ] dif
rd I no t fear to meet the e/leÂ£t of the disagree- E;
in able sensations which an addition to the pub' ad
te I lie burdens generally produced. cu
ir " I Mr. Thatcher said, that tho' attached tu
BS I fee why we should adopt the French language tic
I altogether ; he objected to the words " state
los requisition" in the resolution, and fug- rÂ£l
I gefted whether the words " hold in readi- j
I ness," would not answer as well. ! an
'S* I Mr. Blount conceived the obje&ion of j nc
I a very trifling nature. The word had been j
repeatedly used by the old Congress. But
Ir. I he supposed the gentleman from Maffachu-
ok j setts, by his remark, meant to insinuate that "
Ihe might be one of that French fadtion, c
iri- I which had been so often talked of, for hav- P'
ta I ing used, what he chose to imagine was a !
I term borrowed from the French,

be I said nothing about a French faftion, or of L.
â ms the members belonging to itâlut a guilty

eet I Mr. Lyon said he supposed, that if the '
I gentleman from Maflachufetts could be j '
tee I convinced that jy requisition" was good En- | 0
vfr. I glifh, he would have no objection to it. j f
I The Journals of the house, for '94 were 1 '
nd- recurred to, and Mr. Blount agreed to mo- j j
iich dify his resolution, so as to readin the words 1
rat- I of a resolution of the house then adopted, j "
tain The resolution is in substance as follows : 1
ob- Resolved, That the President of the U- v '
the I nited States bÂ» authorised to call on the ! '
ght I Executives of the several States, to take |
the I measures to organize, and hold in readiness | x
;ne- j 80,000 militia including officers and privates
ght to be apportioned among the several States |
iple in proportion to their number of white in-
ider I habitants, viz.
not For Georgia (blank) j
lent I North Carolina (blank) &c.
I The resolution was then adopted. The I
tion I second resolution offered by Mr. Blount, J
lica- I after some conversation was withdrawn.
Pre- I Mr. Smith's (Ch.) 3d resolution which
â¢ifed I was originally to authorise the purchase of 1
In- I frigates and (loops of war ; and which he
I had modified so as only to empower the Pre

was I vessels for the protection of our trade, Came

itive. I Mr. Sml th (S. C.) could not believe the
[tood I cbjeftion serious. Though by the confti
giv- I tution Congress are to provide a navy ; yet
h he I surely they can authorise the President and
â cog- I give him means for providing it. Congress

/hich they not be at liberty to direst the Execu-
I tive to obtain a loan, or must they go in a
as it body to Holland to make the bargain,
iwful Something must be entrusted to the Execu
nerce tive or in time of danger the country could
?f A- j not be defended. The House did not ap
rainft pear of opinion, that the country was now
d on- in such a state as to require any additional
es or armament ; but circumstances might turn
I up during the recess to demand it ; it was
on 'as I therefore expedient to vest this "power -of
procuring a few {mall vessels or gallics in the

Mr. Nicholas obj-Â£led to veiling the . a mot
difcretionarj' power iÂ« the Executive as Â£;ig,
clearly contrary to the {pirit of the conftitu- decla
tion, 'which Ihotild not be departed from T1
without a cafe of extreme neeelfity. This 38 tc
was not such a cafe. The resolution propo- carru
pose to leave it to the President to fay whe- J i
ther the veflels contemplated were necessary; mitte
now he hrvs already said in his speech that That
they are ; if the question of expediency be the I
referred back to him, as the House knows circu

to make the purchase; yet -many â¢;entle- the d

Mr. Smith (Ch.) agreed to the modifica
â  tion, which was to insert in the resolution,
: the words "if eircumftances should hereaf
â¢ ter arise, to render the fame necessary for
: the defence of the sea coast."
Mr M'Dowell observed, that tjie Prefi
â  dent had already given it as his opinion that (
â¢ such a purchase fliould be made. But the Apri
, House are in possession no doubt of every in- lying
\ formation on which the President had foun- had

o Mr. Swanwick objefted to the refolu- brig
e tion as modified.
ej Mr. Harper conceived that gentlemen abri
e mistook the objed of the resolution. It did but:

e the purchase ; but that future may. If She
d i discretionary power was not veiled in the loos*
1- Executive in cafe eircumftances arise to make S
)i additional force necessary, all that the Exe- Hul
cutive could do would be to call the legida- Bay
:d ture together ; and this would not be effec- Her
>t tual from the time required for this opera- S
re tion.
. â¢ s
Mr. M'Do\vf.ll again spoke against the
l~ resolution. Eight or ten veflels, would only 01
be fufficient to protest our coasting, trade ; j f 101
and the danger to it was not so imminent, 011
â  nor the value of it so considerable as to au- vo >
:n i thorife the expence of such an armament.
Jt Mr. Gallatin agreed, that the resolu
tion as modified was less objectionable than
" l before : But he was against it even in its
present ffiape. The resolution as it now
stood confined the operation of the propos
ed armament to the sea coast ; but this did
j not give him a clear idea of its objeft. Was A"
it to prevent aftual Tnvafion on the coast ?
j, j ; The force then was infufficient. Was it to
; protect our veflels within the jurisdiction of
! the United States, within nine miles of the
"k coast ? This objeft was not worth the ex
pence ; we have fuffered but little from de-
predations within our jurifdiftion. Was it
to protest our coasting trade and other vef-,
[ convoys ; this seemed to be the idea of the
n ~ ! gentleman from S. Carolina, and there was
' reason to presume it was that of the Execu
" | tive, and hre they were at issue. The gen
-ds 1 t ' eman f rom S. Carolina, fortified with the
J( j opinion of the Attorney General, had con
" tended, that an American vessel provided
jj with regular sea letters, &c. having exhibit
ed them, might refill if attempted to be cap
j tured by the French, and he presumed this
e j- 5 j was the opinion of the Executive. He
te , could not coincide in this opinion ; but fet
tes ting this difference of opinion aside, was
â¢" S the House ready in the present state of things
to give the Executive the means of enforc
ing it. While negotiations were in train
for an accommodation of differences, was it
->h e prudent to provide the means for measures,
which he should not merely term irritating,
' but which went to aftual holtility.
iich It was said, that-the means were only
of lodged in the hands of the Executive to be
.he provisionally used ; that he is only to use
3 re- them if eircumftances should arise hereafter
lafe to make it advifeable. But the President
ime has already declared he now thinks it advife
able ; of course the smallest additional cir
tion cumftances will authorize him, wilt make it
the his duty, consistently with the opinion he has
for expressed, to use the means. This proposed
tto armament would not be wanted for the pro-
Ex- teftion of our coast against the Weft India
"era- privateers. They will not come here in any.
numbers from the nature of their armament ?
: the those who do come will be the large veflels,
nfti- with regular commiflions for the fake of
yet making captures, not of plundering. He
and saw no reason to expeft much de
jrefs predation on our coast ; the bill lately paf
"(hall ed preventing the exportation of ammuni
ecu- tion, &c. will go towards lessening the dan
in a ger. He concluded by mentioning the fitu
vain. ation of our finances as not of a nature to
;ecu- warrant expence of problematical or not in
:ould dispensable utility. Our expence equals our
: ap- revenues ; and in iÂ£ci the deferred debt
now will require an annual sum of 1,200,000
ional dollars. ,
