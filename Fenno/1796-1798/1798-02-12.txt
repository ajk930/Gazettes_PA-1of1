this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up

fed to the unfortunate La Fayette, fn letters,
which fugitive fo "in, the aathor who could only
devote a few wcrks to this occupation, was obliged
to adopt. Although circumftanc-ss arc in many
refpe&s different at the present day, from what
tiiey were in the year 1790, when these letters
were written, yet it may be jaftly said, that so ma
ny absolute and permanent data still remain, that
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re

â¢Kffiy in the form fa tableau, to appraise the im

land un ted. The author examines at *.ach article,
whether it can be better iuuiilhed frwm France or
Englandâlt is principally on this fubjeft (which
would have aitonilhcd a meÂ»e thcoriil) that the author
appears to evince great commercial experience. These
kind of tableaux, uuluckily as difiicult to obtain as
they are much to be defiled, are the only sure guides
the ttatefman can take tor th" policy of treaties, de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We cannot too much admire the apparent ex
a&nefa of colonel Swan's calculations ; aad although
the propheAes of Lord Sheffield have already been
contradi&ed by experience, and by feverai able pens,
yet it is curious lo lee the author of the prcient work,
clifpute with him the only graucd on which he has
not been hithcito attacked, by proving that Fiance,
under the required condition, will We better able
than Great Britain to supply us with feverai articles,
which the Englilh author allots cxciufively and forev
er to the latter; the author's paUiatrty ej/efl on (if he
has any) does not appear to have at any nme created
a fartiality ofjudgment. '1 he result of this calculation
is that in 17Â¥9, that is to fay, at a period when arts
and manufactures did not present ia France the vast
means and probability of extension which they now
poilcfs. that even it> 1789, it wss that
France would not only have the means to supply one
half of any given Quantity of the produAions 6f France
, and tngland united, but alio to enter iflto competition
with Gieat Britain for the remainder, ia proportion
to the wildoin of her government, and the lndaliry
â¢f her inhabitant*.
LETTER IV.

aad particular examinaiion of their faiiablenefs to

Utau is by no means fupeittuous . the principle of the
advantages which would result to Franoe from the
importation cf provifians and raw materials, is every
where applied ; and it is upon this argument, that
the author eftablilhes his demands to the French go
vernment, for the limited admiAon of the produc

It appears from the reports of the sworn 1
committee of the senate, appointed for tbe i
purpose of determining on the validity of |
the eleftion of Israel Israel, that they have 1
decided he was not duly elefted a member j
of that body. This decision was not made j 1
until after a long and attentive examination ' ]
of the merits of the cafe, and a long and 1
patient hearing of the counsel for the fit- (
ting member. The chara&ers of those who :
compose the committee place them above <
the suspicion of being influenced, by any
considerations inconsistent with the most un
deviating re&itude, and although the con
trary idea has already been circulated in the
Aurora, yet we are all too well acquainted
with the chara&erand conduft of Mr. Bache
to be in tfyeleaft degree biassed by his pub
lications.
it is a trite observation, but it is one
which can never be too often repeated, that
the exercise of the right of fuffrage is the
most important duty of a citizen. If e<rer
there was a crisis which rendeied an atten
tion to this duty indispensably necessary it
is the present. While a perfidious foreign
foe menaces our peace and independence and
an inveterate faction at home threatens ns
with all the horrors of intestine discord, the
truly patriotic heart is indeed filled with ap
prehension and alarm : but this alarns ought
not to grow into terror, it ought to call
forth the exertions but not ftupify and par
alize the faculties of the mind. The fac
tion of which 1 speak, has always been re
markable ffir its a&ivity, entorprize and u
nioÃ ; of late it has been uncommonly so.
Mr. Bache himfelf when congratulating his
party on their fuacefs at the last eledtion
publicly attributes it more to the union of
their efforts than to the superiority of
their strength. Let us be equally united
and we cannot fail to be fuccefsful. It is
to be observed that the candidate who (hall
be defied will have nearly fonryeirsto serve;
that it is but too probable before the expi
ration of that period, notwithstanding
the earnest endeavours and ardent withes of
our government, we (hall be fnvdlved in a
foreign war, and that therefore whatever
may have been the opinions of any of us
refpe&fhgthe origin of our difficu'ties'with
France, there can be but one opinion as to
the union and vigor with which the war
fhoutd be carried on. By placing men in
office who are by their own acknowledg
ments hostile to the measures of our ad
minillration, if not toKhe existence of our
confutation, this end can never be obtained.
Without eÂ»tering into the merits of the
private charafter of Mr. Israel, it mull be
obvious to all that the rcfpefiability of the
people represented must always in a great
degree depend upon the refpe&ability of
their representative. This man certainly U
not qualified by his education, or by polit
ical reflection, for a legislator ; and the past
which he can take in our public delibera
tions must neceflarily be a very confined pne.
r Oppoled to him is a man who for several
years his been engaged in public life, whose
mind is Sored with tifefiil information, and
highly embellished by literature ; whose
moral character not even his enemies have
dared to impeach, ard for difmifling whom
1 from our public caunfcls no other reason has
' ever been given than his attachment to our
| constitution and laws.
It may be proper here likewise to hint
that the issue of the next eleftion will be
' con littered in some measure, as anexpreflion'
of thefentimer.ts of the people; and that
at this time such an expriflion is of theut
moft importance. It ja nÂ»t merely the si-
lent vpte of one man that is to be attended p<
to. The politics of the representative of h
the metropolis of the United States have a
weight to which those of the representative
of no rtther diftriÂ£l are entitled ; and the e
lcfikion of Mr. Israel will give occasion to a
new triumph to his party ; will be viewed j
as a new proof of divisions, arid will there
fore be a new invitation to our enemies to '
imprison and thumb-screw our sailors ;
to plunder our merchants, already reduced
almost to bankruptcy by their piracies ; a- '
gain to insult our government, and there
fore once more to degrade, in the eyes of all ,
mankind, the name of America.
Already are his party at w<srk : no ex- j.
ertioÃi on their part will be spared, aad it is j
only by your most vigovousVfiorts that their
hnpes can be prostrated.

' deney to conupt the morals of youth, and
lead them into temptations which may injure
their reputation. From the most diCnter
efted motives, and for the good of my coun

tribute three hundred and forty dollars, to

from the Salem Caxette.
MR. CUSHING,
The question of arming our merchant
veflels, however it may be obfeured by meta -
physical disquisitions, is one of the simplest
that can be stated. If a maci, travelling on
1 the high road, has a right to take a club in
his hand, from an apprehension that he may
1 be assailed by robbers, on the fame princi
ple has he a right to put guns on board his
; vessel to traverse the high seas. If the for
: mer witty his club (hould violate the laws of
1 his country, or the latter with his guns io
â¢ frail the laws of nations, each is amenable
i for his condtidVto those laws, and to be pun
-1 idled accordingly. Whatever may be the
1 consequences, if the principle is rightâif
r natÂ«re herfelf, which di&ates it, is rightâ
-1 I hope it will be afted upon. It isaprin
- ciple which in its operation is dire&ed a
â  gainst all nations, so far as they are disposed
r to be aggrefiors, and so far I wish they may
. feel its cffe&s.
: Whatever is right, is prudent; and in
c tny opinion the arming of our vessels would
t be further prudent, because every defenfive
t mcafure would tend to prevent that dreadful
f calamity, a war; as every nation will be'
1. feared, and its friendship desired in propor
tion to its llrength.
t Every thing has its small beginnings. A
few armed veflels might indeed excite the
. contempt of those great powers, whose
il thunder makes the ocean tremble; but hif
e tory affords a thousand inftanccs, and our
d own country is one of them, of small pgw
e ers rising to uuexpe&ed ftrcngth, formida
e blenefs, and eventual triumph,
n It is to be that our government will
is never adopt, the half-way, dastardly mea-,
r sure of an embargo, which I fee recommend
ed in the Boston papers. An embargo is at
it bed adefpoti'c aft; it is tying the hands of
ic indtiftry, or turning them agiinft the pro
n' perty of others. We have a right to the.
it ocean, the great highway of all nations;
t- and when it is infefted with robbers, may
i- we have the prudence to travel with wea-
pons of defease; and if attacked, may we r
have the spirit to use them.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES '

FRIDAY FEBRUARY 9.
Tht House having refelved itfelf into a Committee j
of the Whole, on thÂ« Report Â«f the Committee
Â©f Privileges, Mr. Dint in the Chair,
i Mr. Shipard said, the member from |
Vermont had bten g'lilty of Â»o iudecctricy
for which lit ought to be expelled from his (
feat. The Â«flense was fncli as would not (
be fuffcred in any civil company. It was >
an offen. *>without ptovoCation ; forthefirft (
offence was committed by him on the mem- (
her from Connefticut, in faying that the
members from that state fmight their own
interest at the expence of the public good. ]
He'was surprised that any Gentleman would (
defend such a man. But the offenct wa3: (
attetipted to bÂ« mitigated, by faying that | (
the house was not in feflion. He believed
| the House was as much in fcfiion as it ever J
I was, as one half of the members were at (
i least in their feats; and the offence being ]
committed within thÂ« walls of the House, |
i the member ought certainly to be expelled.
! If the house would not Â«xpel a member for (
an oflcnce so gross, what would the world ]
fay of them? They would be called beajls, .
and not Gentlemen. Bat it was said the |
constituents of the member from Vermont
would be injured by the member's axpulfioo; ,
so far from it, he doubted not nineteen
twentieths of the people of his diftriA would
fay he was deserving of expulfioa. Was a
man, who could be guilty of such behavi
ouras is complained of, fit fora l,tgifla;or?
Certainly not; no well-bred, well-disposed
man could keep company with him. The
Gentleman himfelf acknowledged that it
was his common pradlitte to feourge every
one who offends him. It was not neeeffary
therefore, to feud to Vermont to enquire
his charadler there. For his own part, he
could not consent. to fit with him. If he
must be a Legiilator, it should be in a part
of the world where all decisions were made
by jpitting and scratching. He W3S sure no
gentleman, or modest man, could plead in
behalf of fueh a raan. He hoped, therefore
' the member from Vermont would be expel
led without | spending much time upon the
business; he was sure this ought to be done
â¢ if they had any regard to their own dignity
â  or the dignity of the country.
1 Mr. Nicholas was always desirous of the
approbation of the gentleman just fat down,
: beeaufe he believed he always a&ed from
â  the best motives. He hoped that Gtntle
i man would also have allowed that others
: might aft from principle, as well as himfelf.
â  He could not refrain, however, from do
- ing what he conceived to be his duty, what
- ever might be the motives which gentlemen
- chose to attribute to his conducV. But
t whatever his opinion might be of the mea
sures propofed to be taken in consequence
t of the offence under consideration, with res
- petit to the offence itfelf, he condemned it
Â» as much as any other Gentleman, as inde
cent and improper.
Mr. N. felt it neeeffary
. vations on this fubjeft, because the report
of the committee of Privileges does not state
1 faiSts as they are; he supposed it bad been
~ composed baftily, as it certainly does not
s eortefpond with the impreflion which the e
_ vidence makes. The Gentleman who in
s troductd the refelution, like a good lawyer,
has made the cast broad enough to support
* it. He has evidently given way to the im
preflion of the moment, as the evidence cer
, tainlv dors not support the allegations there
. in contained.â [Mr. N. read the refolu
a tion.] He said he could not agree to this
- resolution, because he denied that the house
was fitting, or that the offence was done in
s the view of the House.âHe should make
some observations on the testimony, and
(hew wherein it differed from the report of
the committee. He needed no witness to
prove the state of the house at the time this
t tranfatlion took place âit was fully in recol
- leftion of every Gentleman. Not one of
â 1 them (except the two members appointed
n to count the ballots) was attending public
n bufintfs, & very few indeed who werenot out
J of order. The area of the house was full
of squads, carrying on conversation with
! out reflraint. One article of testimony was
(trongas to this faft. * The attention of the
â f Gentleman from Maryland (Mr. S. Smith)
was drawn the convetfation holding
e round the fire behind him, by a loud laugh.
There could be no doubt, therefore, that
e the House was not engaged in business, was
not in order, was not in a situation to be
- disturbed by any tranfa&ion of this kind.
Indeed, he did not underftarid, from what
J " had fallen from the Gentleman from S. Car
d oliua, that he thought it wa6. The argu
y ment was, that the Speaker having once ta
ken the Chair, called the house tn order,
10 and, the Journals having been read, the
'd rules of the house knew of no mode by
fe which it cAld be disorganized, without an
ul adjournment.
ie ' Suppose this position was true, what re
r" fults ?. Why, that it was their business to
have been in order, and not that they were
A- so ; for, whilst the Speaker was out of his
chair, whilst the members were out of their
places, and violating the rules of order, no
f- one could fay that the house was in feflion,
ur or that it could claim rcfpeil from others as
v " a legislative body. Was it poflible, there
a* fore, for men, who were not doing what
the rules of the house required them to do,
ill to call upon of her members to keep the rules
inviolate ? But, Mr. N* said, he did not
<1 admit the principle, that the business of the
at house can uever be suspended, until an a&u
al adjournment takes place. At the time
Â°" when this tranfadlion happened, the house
â  had authorized two of its members to do a
s i business which aAually prevented the ordi-
J T nary business of the house froui going on.
For, he atked, if Â» notion could have been
made whilst tliefe membfrs w i aunting
the ballots > Upon another or. iv>n, after
thÂ« ballot! were colle&ed, a i -.. it ion was
made to adjourn, hut it was declared to be
out of order. The Speaker gave no reason
for this opinion ; but it was obviously be
cause tellers were employed to eount the
votes, and had no: yet made their report ;
and would gentlemen fay that another mo
jion would have been better received, iÂ»r
have been a&ed upon so as to have prevent
ed these gentlemen from doing fheir )pufi
nefs ? Ctrtainly not. There could not, the*
have bÂ«en a Motion made. What, then,
was the (late of the house ? Were members
obliged to keep their. fer.ts, though they
could not be eallÂ«d upon to do anybuliaefs ?
They could not be considered as Infpeftors
of the eonduÂ£t of gentlemen appointed to
count the ballots, their distance prevented
them from having aÂ»y such cognizanceâ
Here was a situation, then, when the mem
bers of the house were difeharged from any
duty for two hours, and during this period,
the tranfaflion which is now the fubjed of
enquiry, tsok place. Members raight have
gone where they pleased ; all that was re
quired of them was, to be ready to receive
the report when the Tellers were ready to
make it. Suppose a jyeat part of the mem
bers had left the house, and when they re
turned, had been told of this quarrel,- It
mult have been said, your rules consider the
house as in session, though you were abfeut,
aid the quarrel having happened, it must
be slated, as happening in rhe view of the
house whilst fitting. How, said be, rauft
the resolution be formed, To as to declare the
faÂ£t in such a cafe ? It rauft be, " Refolred,
that M. Lyon, for a gro'fs indecency aud
insult committed, See. at the time when the
rules fay the house might to have been fit
ting, but when, in faÂ£l, the house was not
in order, nor the members is the house, fee.
And was it sot a (Irong prefunaption against
this resolution, when reÂ«ourfe must be had
to such an extraordinary form to make it
confident ? Or could gentlemen fay when
the resolution before the committee went a
broad that the house was in adual session at
the time ? They could not. He reÂ«olleÂ£k
ed one circumstance whieh peculiarly mark
ed the situation of the house. Near the
time when the offence now under confeder
ation was committed, one of the Senators
was feited in his chair writing a letter. He
did not himfclf think the house in feflion at
the time, and should have thought himfclf
as much at liberty a 9 if the house had not
been called to order at all. In order to juf
tify the resolution before the comraittep, the
jiaior. of the Rules had been set up against
faÃ. Mr. N. said he should not notice the
offence at all as done out of the hcufc, be
cause the resolution confines the aft as an of
fence against the house whilst fitting. He
did net fay this, because he was afraid of
meeting the fubjeft on that ground, but
because it was foreign to the present quof
tion.
The gentleman from S. Carolian yester
day made some observations en this subject.
He told the committee, and they had been
told the fame before, that the filuation in
which the house was at the time this affray
happened, was tie fame as whea the Speak"
er leaves the chair during the reading oF
long communications. Could any one itn
pofe on himfclf fe as to believe this ? Was it
not the duty of members to attend to the
reading of all papers presented to them i
Whereas they were not obliged to attend to
members employed in counting|hallbtÃ.
Since gentlemen deemed this so clear a cafe,
it was altonifhing, he fjH,that they should
rely upon so poor an argument at this.
To conllitute the crime of which themcm.
ber from Vermont flood charged, it should
clearly appear that the aft was done with an
intention to break the rules of the houft.
But, if gentleman were not fatisfied with
his fiatements to prove the house was not
in order at the time, they ninfl certainly
allow that there was fufficient reason, from
a view ?.f the situation of things at the time
to impofi upon a member unacquainted witk
the rules of the house. The trember from
Vermont had but lately got his feat in the
hcufe, and of course was not well acquainted
with its rules ; and feeing the members of
the house in the ituation they were in, the
Speaker himfclf holding a eonverfation with
him; and, though not encouraging him in
it, yet by aflcing questions, pushing him
farther into it tb; n he other wife would pro
bably have goneâthe Speaker calling upon
him and. another gentleman in converfation
to take cart, or they ivoutd -wantJeconJj." When
this was the situation of things, might it not
have imposed upon any member in the houfa
Could it be (onfidercd that the Speaker
1 thought the rples of the house were likely
to be violated, when he thus fpokfe ? Mr.
N- did not pretend to fay that this conduit
of the speaker was not conformable to therules
of the house ; but he believed it was inten
ded at a private admonition, arid not as an tr
ier of the Speaker of the House.
p In taking notice of the circumstance t:n
---' d?r which this Wufinefs happeued, he did
not mean to jufiify, cr apologize for the
1 conversation of the member from Vermont.
He did not eonflder it as either decent or
jnftifiable ? but he thought there was a ju
Â» ftification arising out of the paflions of this
- gentV.rnan, which could not be loft fiuht of
H Before he went to this circumstance, Mr. N.
r said he would state that the report of tfec
' committee of privileges did npt agree with
> the fadts as they had been stated to the cem
s mittee of the whole. It stated in that report
* that the Speaker was fitting on one of the
t member's feats,and Mr. Grifwoldjnear him,
, that Mr. Lyon was Handing without the
* bar of the house, speaking lovd enough to
' be heard, and th:it thsTubjf& was the flat*
c of Connedljcut." It vii of importance tbat
- this statement ihouid be eorrefl, as iÂ» would
e appear as the ait of the house. By it,it would
c appear that though the converfatinn of Mr.
a Lyon refpe&iag Connefticul." wss not ad
i" drcfled to Mr. Grifwold, the thing was
!â¢, tantamount, as he was present. The com
n mittee of |he whole would recoiled tha! thiswas not the eafc. It was efteblifned in proof j *
that the converfationhad continued for fonie I
time betwixt the Speaker and Mr. Lvon be- !
fore Mr. Grifwold was present ; and none iz
of the other Connefticut members werejntar T
enongh to be considered as the objefts of G
it. He would go further and fay, that it ir
was not in proof what part of the converfa- ' it
tionofMr. Lyon, Mr. Grifwold heard. 'el
The' moil o(Tenfive part of the discourse Was
the beginning of it,which it was pretty evi
dent Mr. Grifwold did not hear. Mr. Lyon
by faying that the members from
Connefticut werefeekingofScesat the cxpenfe
of the public good ;butnotoneofthewitneffcs
Â«âouldfaythatMr. Grifwold heard this (oneof
them indeed thought fn,'but was not cer
tain. There was strong preemptive evi
dence, that Mr. G. was not within hear- tl
ing of this conversation, as none of the three ' ft
different observations which he made to Mr. ft
Lyon referred to the not offenfive part of . si
h - . ; l
When Mr. G. asked Mr. Lyon " if he | 2
fought the pcopU of Connefticut with a j t
wooden sword," it referred to that part of ;i(
his conversation when he said he had to fight i h
tjie people of Connefticnt when they came , t
ioto his diftrift WheÃ Mr. G. said," you L
cauli net convince the boftler," it 1 c
evidently applied,to that part where he said, i b
if he were to go into the state of Connefti- 1 c
cutij be could change the sentiments of the ; 1
peÂ»plei and when lie added, " you could i *
not effeft your purpose, if vou took with 1
you your wooden sword," ii iiad relation to
the fame part of Mr. Lyon's conversation.
Though it must be allowed, this converfati- c
on was arrogant oÂ» the part of the member 1
from Vermont, yet no evidence went to shew i
tbat Mr G. heard the raoft offenfive part <
of it, as it was clear no part, of what he ]
said had reference to it; and if he did hear 1
it, there was still less probability that Mr.
L knew that he wÂ«s within hearing.
Mr. N. said, be would consider the ef- 1
feft which Mr. Grifwold'* attack was likely
to produce upon Mr. Lyon. It appeared
that for some purpose or other, which he 1
pretended not to know, Mr. Lyon's hifto- 1
ly was to be raked up for twenty years paS. 1
A franfaftion which at that distance of tinse :
took place, had bee* introduced with a view
of finking him in public estimation. The
fir ft time this painfnl circumstance was in- ;
troduced to Mr. Lyon, he refufed to take :
notice of it; but the gentleman from Con
nefticut laid hold of bim which was tanta- j
mount to faying you Iball listen to what I
have to fay, and repeated the sarcasm.
Mr. N. said he did not kuow, btcsufe he
hated questions of privileges, and thought
they ought always to be avoided, except
pressed by necessity, from their incompeten
cy to decide upon them, what ought to
have been the conduft of the gentleman
from Vermont on this occasion. But let
gsntlemen throw this member to what dis
tance they pleafs from them, they mull al--
low him txÂ» possess some feelings in common
with themselves. They could not suppose
he would be willing to refig* a charafterand
{landing, which had been obtained at the
price of long service. And though gentle
men may consider themselves as vastly more
enlightened and refpeftable than the mem
ber "from Vermont, they cannot expeft he
is devoid of every principle of felf-love.â
Could any gentleman have forborne Â»o take
notice of an insult of the kind which was
offered him? It is impofiible. He did not
pretend to fay, that the particular aft with
whijch the gentleman from Vermont resented
the affront was the most proper; he did not
know what would have been proper. He
did not know in what way such an insult
fliould have been treated.
Gentlemen would probably fay he ought
tahave foreborne noticing the sarcasm. But
did not gentlemen know that there was a
circumstance in thismember'sGtuation which
rendered it a peculiar one?. If he had had
recourse to the ordinary mode of fettling
diffcrehces, would it not have been said to
hiin, "No; you have been cartvteredâyou
are infamous, I will not meet yoÂ« as a gen
tleman." In what way, then, could this
member have {hewn to the world, that if he
had once failed in bis duty, he was ready
n*w to (hew that he was no coward, and
that he had been injured and abiftd in the
former tranfaftion. He a(ked, whether be
. ing placed in such Â» situation, there was not
some apology to be made for afting in the
manesr he did? Nor did Mr. N. think
the mode which Mr. Grifwold had taken
to repel any thing which the gentleman from
Vermont had said against the representatives
from Connefticut was the best caleÂ»lated for
the purpose.
IF tb<?u, there was an extenuation of the
conilud of Mr. Lyon, either from the dt
vation of the house at the time, from his
being inexperienced with refpeft to the rules
of the house, or from his peculiarity of fit
nation, as to the (ligma which had been re
vived upon his charafter with refpeft to his
eeurage, be did not think it was a cafe which
called .for the feverelt pumlliment which
could be inflifted. If the highest pariifh
ment were to be inflifted in this cafe, what
â would gentlemen do, where 1 man should
render bimfelf infamous, when a man (liquid
be found so defrftive of moral principle as
Jo be wholjy unfit to hold bis situation ? To
al confidently, he thought they (hould al
low of some grade, in the nature of offenc
es,
Mr. N. Concluded by noticing an obser
vation from gentlemen advocating the moti
on, cautioning gentlemen against being in
fluenced by a spirit of party ia the present
decision; he thought iuch obfervatiuns
would be best omitted as they would wpe
rate equally on both fides.

On Thursday arrived ia Hampton Roads \ _

from Liibon bound to Baltimore. From c
Mr. Brandram (a gentleman who came pas
senger in the above vefTel) we have informa
tion that he read in a London paper of the
27th or 38th of November, an account of
the arrival in London of one of the Amer
ican Qommiffioners from Paris, but which
he dues not recoiled. He further informs,
that he had it from the best authority that
lord St. Vincent, with his fleet and the whole
of the British troops were to evacuate Lis
bon in the course of a few weeks. The 1
queen Portugal had forwarded 80 pounds <
weight of diamonds to Paris in part pay- 1
â ment of "the sum stipulated for in the treaty I
made between her and France. _ '
February 6.
At a late hour la ft night, capt. Ceiley, 1
of the (hip Flora, arrived ia .town from
Hampton Roads, where his {hip oow lies,
after a passage of 44 days from Gnernfiy.
Capt. Coiley politely handed us London pa
pers of the Ilth, 15 th and 19th December;
he gave a few to some of the officers of the
British ships of war, lying in the Roads.
From those we received we ha6en to give
the following crude funnmary of
LATE" EUROPEAN NEWS.
That Generals Buonaparte and Joubert
had arrived on the 6th of December at Pa
ris ; that a great part of the army of Italy
had returned into Franceâthat a new con
spiracy has taken place in Paris, and that a
Dumber of the conspirators were committed
to the Temple ; that the Pope refufes to
acknowledge the independence of the Cis
alpine Republic, in consequence of
ten thousand republicans are marching to
wards Rimini", to support the demand of
the Cisalpine ambafiador ; that every exer
tion is making in France to organize the ar
my which is to aft against England. It is
alio laid at Paris, that the Pope has enter*
ed into a secret treaty w'ith the Emperor of
Ruflia ; that the King of Pruflia'is dead ;
and that in eonfequense of the ratification
of the treaty* between Portugal and France,
the Englift troops at are reduced to
extreme want ; Earl St. Vincent Hill con
tinues off the harbor of Lisbon.
Stoeks experience but little variationâ
on the 12th Dec. Consuls were at 49 1-2.
On the 14th Decomber, Mess. Fox Sher
idan and other members of the opposition,
attended in their places, in the house- of
Commons ; their attendance was occasioned
by the general alarm which Mr. Pitt's new
financial hill has caused in all parts. The
debates, although very lengthy, (hall be
given as soon as possible.
Of our Comraiffioneri-we have no other
account than what was received by a vessel
from Havre, which had put into Guernf
ney in distress, prior to Capt. Colley's fail
ing, which informed, that there wer* three
CommifEoners appointed on the part ot the
French republic, to treat with ours ; and
that the general opinion was that matters
would be amicably adjusted.

On motion of Mr. Kyder, for the lioufe of

tbe whole hoHfe, oh the Treaty between his Brit

ca, Mr. Nicholls remarked to his majcly's
ministers, that the bill proposed to be brought
in did not go to the extent requ red both by the
commercial and political interests of this coun
try. He said that all regulation of ihe inier
courfe between the United States of America and
the Uritilh islands in the Weft-lodiet, was en
tnelv left out in the proposed bill. Tnisinterâ 
eourfe was left as it hau been ever lince the
peacs with America, to be regulated on the spur
of the occafien, by orders of council, or the
proclamations of governors in tie Weft In
dits: as a pre of of this, he took notjee of a pro
elaoiation lately ilTued by tbe governor of Bar
badoes, Hating 'he danger to whieh that ifl.ind
was exposed from the faircity of provi
fior.s, and inthorifing, for a twelvemonth, the
