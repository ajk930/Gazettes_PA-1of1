Debate on providing the meant Â«/ Foreign iH- e nd
tercourfe. li(h
(ContirueJ from Saturday:! Gajettf ] hac
Mr. SiTd*Â£AVES said, it was much to
be rrgretted, that when gentlemen thougat t^c
it necessary to introduce their opinions to
the consideration of the house, they (hould a(
fappofe themselves jullified in taking a lnti- g p|
tnde remotely and unnecessarily connefttrd
trith the fubjedt under conGderation. These
fort of remarks could not be permitted to go {u(
Without reply; and in consequence, the de
bates of the legislature appeared, as if ut
were intended nibre jo influence the public i Do
mind, than the minds of gentlemen in that
house on the decision of the queilion before i nQ
He did not think these observations , ejf
without their application on the present oc- ,
cafion. If the gentleman who made the !
motion before the committee had confined .
hiÂ»nfelf to the propriety of appointing minis- j p (
tcrs plenipotentiary to certain courts, it
would have been decided by this time; but j
he had thought proper to go into adcelara-
tioti on the fetal effcils of Executive patron-
agr, and on the particular tifes made Â° f il i w
in this government. He afke.d if any ger.-;
tkman could difpaffionatelyfay that this had !
connection with the fubjeft before the com
mittce. If the gentleman's observations
were taken in their broadest extent, they
went to fay the patronage of the Execu
tive Wa* dangerous te the liberties of the
People of this Countryâthey went to de
feat and dishonour a power created by the
Constitution of the Country. If thegenile-
man meant any thing, therefore, (and he
supposed he had some meaning in what he
said) he could mean no more than this, that
it was improper in the Executive to appoint
improper pcrfous to improper offices in the ai
Government. This proposition was felf-e- n(
vident, and there could be no disagreement p.
upon it, and no general observations on the
ruinous effetf. of patronage were neceflary.
No man was difpofed,to fay that if the Exec
utive power were unlimited, it might not be a- lt
bused, and all knew that it was wrong to j
appoint improper persons to public offices ; f(
but the true application of the arguments t(
used on this occasion appeared to be, that
the appointments made by the Executive
were made with the single view of increasing w
Executive iofluence, and that, confeqnent
}y, the motives of the Executive were im- w
pure. This position had not, mod aflured-
ly, been supported, by the introduÂ£lion of
any fadl; but the declaration was as broad
and as little fpecific, as the charge itfelt*.â j e
lt had also been observed, that it had be- t(
com? an avowed principle in the government f (
to exclude from public offices, all those who
were <?f a different opinion from the Execu- ei
tivi.-. He knew not upon what foundation t j
this aflertion was made, and it was very im-
material whither true or not. For himfelf, g
hehadnoobieclionto declare it tobehisopin- t
ion, that wherever the administrators of go- Q
vernment had deviated from a rule of this
kind, they had done so to their sorrow and t
to their loss, and the experience of govern- n
mer.t in this refpeft had produced a fad and j,
awful leflbn, which would doubtless have
its cfFedk in future.
But, was it for that house to enquire in- f
to those things ? He believed not. The f
Constitution and laws of the Country had f
made certain offices nee'eflary, and left it to t
the Executive to fill them as he pleased; and v
â¢was it for that house to attempt to control
this discretion ? If it were executed ta the v
injury of the People, the Constitution had
pointed out the remedy to be by impeach-
ment. But where was the crime, the of- t
fence, or the impropriety, of the conduA v
afsribed to the Executive, if it had been a- t
dopted? Would gentlemen fay, that the
Executive ought to appoint persons to of- f
sices who profeffed an opinion contrary toits j
own. Did gentlemen suppose that there t
was such a want of integrity in this depart- t
ment of Government, that it adopted a po- {
litical opinion which it did not believe to be
right; and if it were believed to aÂ£l from e
principle, would it be prudent, or right, to t
admit to a participation in the execution of e
the important duties of Government, per- v
sons whose sentiments were not in 'unison r
with those of the Executive, and who could f
only.create discord and confufion, where no- t
thing but harmony and union ought to pre- ]
vail? If the Executive adled upon just prin- j
ciples, it Would endeavour to give singleness
of design to its operations, and it could on- Â£
ly do this by admitting persons into the go- j
vernment who thought with it. This would (
be a right, prudent and honourable condudl, j
and where it had been deviated from (as he ,
had before observed) Government had re- j
ceived an awful leflbn for its future con- |
dud. (
But why deviate into this wide field of 1
speculation ? The single question before the i
committee was, whether an appropriation 1
ihould be made in support of our present di
plomatic e~flabli)kment. In arguing on this i
question, gentlemen Â£ct out with faying, ]
that at the erigin of this government a cer
tain diplomatic establishment was neceflary,
and that there hadbeen no occafionto change
it; and, if it had been changed, it was now
the time to corre& it; and they called upon
gentlemen to (hew what necessity there had
been for the "change. To that call it was
fufficient to answer, and it was an answer
which muftbe given, that they didnet know.
They had no means of knowing; the Con
stitution had not placed those means in their
hands. For whatever control that house
might afTume to itfelf over the Executive,
it must be admitted that a right judgment
on*this fubjeft could not be formed by them,
as the information neceflary to this judg
ment was not upon the files of that house.
All the diplomatic agents correspond with
the Executive alone, and that branch of go
vernment only could form a correft judg
ment upon diplomatic agencies. Suppose
they were, in tWIr turn, to ask *Â«nd
why.was -not the present etlabliihment ne- exp
ceflary? were they prepared to give a well exc
grounded opinion on the fubjtdt? Hebe- leg!
litvfd they could not. And the burden of frie
proof lay upon them, because they were to
â  endeavouring to deflrqy an existing eftab the
lilhment, without knowingthereafoiis which tio
had induced tb| change. me
' It had been* said by his colleague, that he
I the power of appointing officers, veiled in th<
' the executive, was liable to abuse, and he wa
had referred to the late appointment of the be
j gentleman from S. Carolina whilst a member eci
. of that house, as a proof of it. Mr. 8. go
e a(l<ed if there was any thing in the confti- ro
Â° tution which forhade the President from ap- joi
"" pointing members of the legislature to exec- tal
7 utive offices, aÂ»d on the contrary, if it had fa]
10 ' not been the constant practice to do so ? If of
re i not be called in question, the abuse of its sic
ls j execution could onfy be blamed. In the w
c " j particular iaftance alluded to, his colleague to
had not supposed the executive had been ac- cc
J'r â  tuated by any improper motives in the *p- ju
j pointment ; but only that tfie faÂ£t (hewed ca
lt; I the power was liable to be abused. Unquef- w
ut j tionably this, and every other power might m
a " 1 be abused j but if the power was conftitu- th
1' | tionally used, it could not bÂ£ found fault of
II j with, except it were abused. Where could
R " 1 the executive look for fit persons to fill di- m
plomatic offices, if he were not to chufe fe
n " them from the legislators, whose tituation a
ns evinced that they po/FefTed the confidence of m
e y their constituents, and in which they had h;
had an opportunity of Ihewing that they h;
e pofieflVd abilities for such un appointment, si'
such as would do honor to themselves, and p
such as wert calculated to procure advanta- cl
!Â®" ges for their country. ti
Jj e The question whether that house had the e:
power to interfere with the executive au- p
l3t thority, by withholding appropriations, it
had been fully difcufled in a former congress, n
and the opinion of the country was not a
c ~ now to be fixed on this fubjedl. For that tl
part of the house, who thought the confti- c
tution had not veiled them with the author- a
J" ity of controlling the executive, it was fuf- t
u " ficient to fay, that the executive had tho't c
a " ;t neceflary to introduce the change in the o
to diplomatic department, which was complain- u
s ' ed of, and that they felt themselves bound c
lts to carry his determination into effei* ; but f
at those who think the house of representatives t
ve may control the executive in this refpedlsr f
n S will of course aÂ£t accordingly. I
lt_ Mr. Baldwin said, he perceived there Â£
"]' was a real difference of opinion between the I
" gentleman last up and himfelf. The gen- f
Â° tleman supposed the diplomatic eftablilh- >
a ment was .fixed by the executive, and the t
legislature had nothing to do with it, but
to ptoride the money. Every person rtiuft J
;'' 1 fee, even from a cursory view of the confti- t
tution, that this was defigned'to be a gov- I
u * eminent of departments, legislative, execu- j
on tive and judicial, to be kept as far as poffi- i
ble diftindl. It was the business of the le- '
.'' gWature to establish officers by law ;it was i
ln " the business of the executive to those Â«
offices. Tt would appear, from tracing '
11 back the law now proposed to be continued, <
in that it originated in this manner- He had I
rn " not been notified of the fubje&'.beifig like- 1
in ly to be called up to-day, and was not pre- 1
* V| " pared to be as particular as he could wifhas '
to fails ; helhad endeavored to refrelh his 1
recolleftion fiiice it had been under discus- <
"j fion, and he found it originated from the 1
speech of the President at the opening of <
l Â° the second feflion of the firft congress, in '
,nc J which he said, " that the intersfts of the '
r Â° United States required that our intercourse
1 ' with Other nations Ihould be facilitated by '
la such provisions as will enable me to fulfill my ;
c " duty in that refpeft ; and to this end, that
0 " the compensations to be made to the persons
who may be employed, ihould according to
la " the nature of their appointments, ht defined
1 e by law." This part of the speech was re
Â° " ferredto a committee, and from that orig
"ts inated this law. Want of information at
ere that early time in the government, priven
irt" ted their being as particular as they wilhed,
PÂ°" they fixed a sum to each grade, and a sum
e beyond which the whole amount (liould not
om extend, limited the law to a (hort period,
that it might be open to he correfled by
0 experience. The present motion, if he had
' er * understood it, proposed now to be a little
J" more particular in the eftablilhment, by
fixing the sum for particular places ; to do
no " the very thing then recommended by the
ire- p re sid ent . The fame had always been the
intention of every succeeding congress,
ie which was the reason why they continued it
on " only for short periods, leaving it open to
6Â°' such amendments as should be suggested by
l ' experience. These ideas of the offices be
' ing firft to be established by law, appeared
" e not only to be the sense of the former Pre
re' fident, and of each succeeding congress, as
on " he had stated, but appeared also to be the
opinion of the present President. At the
of last session, he thought that a higher grade
the of office was neceflary at Algiers ; this he
ion 'stated in a message to congress, that as there
di- were great expenditures of money on that
this coast, he thought it neceflary that an eftab
ing, lilhment fhoald be made which would ena
cer- ble him to appoint a very confidential per
ary, son, on whom the other officers there should
nge be dependent, and who ihould control their
low proceedings and expenditures. Congress
pon concurred in this opinion, pafled a law for
had the eftablilhment of the office, and then the
was executive appointed the officer. For these
wer reasons, heconfidered the question as with
ow. in their proper powers, and fairly open to
'on- their deliberation.
heir He was always sorry to hear of the hof
aufe tility of the departments of the government
live, and of how much harm they could do if
uÂ»nt they were hoflile to each other. Th'ey are
lem, designed, and have every inducement to cul
jdg- tivate harmony, and nÂ»t hostility j and in
lufe. the harmonious exercise of their powers,
ivith they contrcul each other ; there can be no
:go great danger of exaeflive patronage in ap
ndg- pointmenti to office, if the office must be
pose tirft eilabliflied by law. If he had not mis-
VindfrSood the gentleman last up, he had tral
expressed some belief ana approbation -of thj, wig
executive's having a political system as to the
legislation, and rewarding and punishing pofi
friends and enemies of ,tbat political fyficm.' cut
to he sure it wasby the constitution made woi
the duty of the President, to lay informa- cha
lion before the .legislature, and to recom- divi
mend measures. wTien he has done this, afit
he has dofi.e his iuty ; but to conceive that (ho
there is a general system of legislation al- def
way,s existing in the executive, which is to the
be regarded as aftaudard ; or that the ex- are
ecutive and departments of the the
government are ;o be considered as floating th:
round on the frrull aÃd frequentlycafual ma- bcl
jorities and mijorities which will for ever trj
take place in representative legislatures, was dci

of a of departments like ours, dei
If a law h'apdenW to be made by the wrong . ce
fide, it womd have had but a bad chance cal
with the executive, or at the feat of judg- an
: ment. There were old republics in this eo
country. He believed their executives or W
judiciaries had rarely taken pirt, or been ha
carried round on the thousand storms with he
which they had been agitated." He could ift
not persuade himfelf that he hid understood of
the gentleman as expressing an approbation ti<
of it, as he thought''*it was stated by him w
! ( Mr. S'ttgreaves J'aid, he had certainly been ft
â¢ mifunderjloed). Mr. Baldwin said he there- th
: fore considered the question a fair one, and at
i a question which was always expefted to be in
F made at the different times when this aft fr
I had been continued by short limitations :it
r had been an old question, and always con- pi
, fidered a vary important one, before the tr
I present government was formed. At the 01
â¢ close of the revolutionary war, the difpoli- t<
tionfor forming many treaties, and having ir
i extVnfive diplomatic connexions with Euro- h
â¢ pean powers, was carried even farther than ft
, it has been since. It was among their firft tl
, national a&s, and discovered marks of youth si
t and inexperience; a few years convinced c<
c them that thty had gone to# far, that this a
. country had little to expeft from treaties si
. and much to fcfe, and that many diploma- tl
- tic connexions were more frequently the w
t caufeof ptrplexity and embarrassment, than w
e of any national advantage. The Congress, n
i- under the articles of confederation, were F
d extricating thcmfelves from that policy as tl
t faft as polfible ; as these expired in course, g
s they were careful not to renew them. For n
several of the last years of that Congress, g
he well reeellflfted that clusters of candi- v
e dates far these appointments, supported by I
e powerful interdls and connexions were uni- 11
i. formly refiftec; and, if he mistook not, t:
t- when this govrrnment came into operation n
e this country htd but one minister in Europe, c
it The conviftioi on this fubjeftwas so strong, t
ft and experience had so fully fettled it as the J
i- true policy, that it remained immoveable c
r- for some time Â»fter organizing the present i
i- government. All foreign (
i- ministers was rtfufed at the firft feflion as far i
;- as he recolleded. At the second feflion, it t
is was urged, in the fpeeeb of the President, :
fe as before stated, and enforced by more par- ;
g ticular explanations to individuals, as design- i
1, ed to be for temporary purposes, refpefting ;
d the northern forts and the property that was '
withheld : under these explanations, a law
j. pafl"ed, as before explained. It was true,
is this policy had been of late, in some mea
is sure departed from. He thought exfleri
f- ence had already been ufeful to them in this
ie course also, and ought to administer cauti
af on to them in feekiug to intermingle in Eu
in ropean politics. Ambafladors and ministers
ie cannot be entirely indifferent :othe charac
fe lers and events with which they are conftant
>y ly surrounded : the {hare they take is very
iy apt to be exchanged between the countries
at to which they belong. He did not wish to
ns be too particular on that point : he was per
to fuaded fafts enough presented themselves to
ed the recollection of every member-to confirm
e- his remark. It might be said that on this
g- also we have an awful lejfon. If evil had
at bceÂ« experienced from this cause, he hoped
n- it would operate as a reason to endeavour to
d, diminish it. He thought it not uhreafon
m able for the house to interpose their reftrain
ot ing power as to granting money, and the
d, more particular establishment of the offices,
jv and thus aid the"other departments of the
id government in bringing back by degrees,
le this part of our policy to its former prin
jy ciples, so well fanftioned by experience.â
lo Whether the present moment was well ti
he med, or whether it was best to give it ano
he ther fliort limitation before we went into a
fs, definite establishment, was another qtleftion,
it on which he was willing to hear more re
to marks. Informed as he was at present, he
>y should vote for the motion, and thought they
e- might make 1 some amendments to the form
ed er bill, already suggested by experience,
e- and which would be ufeful.

h- chair,
ia- Mr. Pinckney *#fe. He understood
sr- the amendment was intended to confine our
ild Ministers Plenipotentiary to London ar.d
eir Paris, and that no higher grade than Min
efs itlers Resident should be employed in any
for other country." He was opposed to this
he change at this time, and to the mode pro
efe posed of doing the business, if the time
;h- were seasonable. It was proper that at this
to junfture, our Ministers should remain as
they were, as it was prudent to derive all
of- the influence and advantage we could from
rnt the situation of our agents in Europe, who
if would not only be enabled to communicate
are more correft information from thence, than
ul- could be derived from any other source, but
in who could also explain the motives and ob
â¢rs, jests of this government, and by that meana
no remove any unfavourable impreflions which
Â»p- may be attempted to be given with refpeft
be to this country; and thereby put our bufi
lif- ness in the best train for securing the neu-
tral ftantJhig which We-have takeft. He
wts againjt it for another teafon. lochange *
the Diplomatic Intercourse in the way pro
poled, would be forcing upon the -Exe- ftji
cutive a measure contrary to its wishes. It Bh
would aifo be affording teftimoijy to the yc;
charge heretofore made, that there was a.
diviiion in the government and in the People
afituationin which many wifhedtofeeus. He
I should beforrytoafford the appearanceofone na
departmentofgoverument having forced upon
the otherachange of measures of which they H<
are the competent Judges, and upon which rai
they have a fled. As it was well known PÂ°
that th-jre was a very intimate connexion JJj
between Spain and Holland, and the coun
try with whom we have at present a mifun-
derftanding, he should be unwilling to de-
prive thii country of the advantages to be p
derived from having ministers at thufe pla- ,
Ces ; belides, it our ministers to be re
called from thence, it would be considered as ; (
an extraordinary proceeding; and might be
eonftrued as intended ta be hostile to them.
Whatever influence Spain or Holland may {(
have in the councils of the country which
he had alluded to, by continuing our min- <
iftersthere.it was probable that weight would
operate in otir favour. There was an addi-
tional reason with refpeft to Spain. It ,
' was well known that we had points ye f to
fettle with the sountry. Our treaty with j
â  that power was not yet carried into effeft,
t and negociations might at this time be go- jr
: ing on in rilation to it, which might be
E fruftrated by the recalofour Ministers.
With refpeft to the grade of Ministers
â  proper to be employed in different coun-
; tries, we must not consult on this fubjeft
: our o\rn ideas alone, but pay some refpeft p _
- to the light in which this business is seen u
in ether countries. From a faft- within
- his own knowledge, he knew of what con
-1 sequence these forms were looked upon in
t the court of Spain. When they wished to e
1 finifh a treaty which'was begun with this u
I country, they desired it might be done by n
3 a Minister of a higher grade than the one re-
! fident there. It was on this requisition,
- that an envoy extraordinary was sent. There y
: was considerable etiquette in this business,
I which it would not be proper altogether to j
, ncgleft. It was necessary when a minister j
: Plenipotentiary was sent to a country, for j
i that country to return a minister of the fame (
, grade. Besides to go into the proposed
r measure at this time, would exhibit a de- ,
, gree of instability in our Councils which j
â¢ would have an unfavourable appearance to i
J Foreign Countries. If peace were restored
- in Europe, and we had no difference to set- (
, tie there, he should agree with the gentle- L
n man from Virginia, and with the opinion (
of the old Congress, that it would be well
to keep no Foreign Ministers in Europe
e All commercial regulations might be as well
e carried on by GonfulSTfirtJy Ministers j Â»â â Â«!
it if any differences should arrife betwixt this
n Country and any of the European Govern
ir ments, special envoys might be sent to fet
it tie them, as heretofore; for when the-fitu
t, ation of this country was considered it would
r- appear to be for our interest to have as pol
-- itical conneftion with Europe as possible,
ig and therefore Ministers could be of no use,
as but might do mifchief. Gentlemen of the
vf different opinions in that house, must fee
e, that we have had ministers in Foreign Coun
a- tries who have done no good, and that Fo
ri- reign Ministers have been sent to this coun
lis try who have done harm. He therefoee
ti- thought that the gentleman from Virginia
a- was right in principle; but he thought that
rrs the time improper, arid he did not approve
c- of the mode proposed to be adopted. He
it- should wish that the fubjeft should be bro't
ry forward by way of an original motion, and
ies receive all the discussion which the rules of
to the house would admit of.
rr- Mr. P. concluded by observing, that he
to had avoided touching upon what gave eo
m lour to the debate of yesterday. It was with
lis concsun he heard such topics intreduced.
ad It must be lamented by every friend to the
:d country, as tending to destroy that harmo
to ny and good will which was at all times
n- proper and desirable, but at this timfc pecu
n- liarly so, when all our efforts ought to be
he joined to avoid the calamities of war ; but
:s, when, if these calamities could not be avoi
he ded, we ought tc stand shoulder to shoulder
rs, and oppose every power who was determin
n- ed to impose upon us. So strongly was
- this impressed uponhis mind,that he thought
ti- every means should be taken to harmonize
o- and conciliate. The best way to effeft this
> a harmony, in his opinion, was to avoid in de
>n, bate.allperfonalities, and thofefubjeftswhich
re- tend to beat the paflions, and which, instead
he of elucidating, embarrass investigations ; for
ey there wa3 no chance for rational enquiry,
m- when full vent was given to resentments and
:e, anger. Mr. P. asked pardon for this
digrtfiion and fat down
fit Mr. Nicholas wished to explain his in
tentions of bringing forward this amend
ment. He believed the gentleman last up
would find they nearly corresponded with
his own. He had no idea of putting aa
m- immediate veto upon the Ministers atpre
:he sent employed, He considered this bill,
though palled wiih a limitation, as a per
iod manent system, and a subsequent clause of
>ur the bill would enable the committee to fix
ir.d the time at which the salaries of Ministers
in- should cease- His wish was to put a limit
iny to this extension of executive power. He
his reminded the gentleman from S. Carolina,
ro- that Holland was not concerned in this bill,

it appears that Sir Cyryle IVyche was preftdent,

He rode from that place to Mr. Burwick's hof

been applied, it was allowed that two men
would have done it. Indeed from many cau

thÂ» ev dence of great prosperity and happiness
in alt parts of this commonwealth, arising, at
well Irom thfc love of order and-due fubmiflioti
to the laws, as from the enterprise, virtue, and
induflry of the clti^isâyet it is to be regret
ted, that external appearances a'e not equally
favorable. Owing to the war in Europe, the
interests of our commerce have greatly fufFered ;
and on that account, as well as from the hlimani
ty natural te Americans, our wilhes for the re
ellablifhment of peace, have been sincere and
ardent. ha 1 , taken place between
the irenth Republic ani the German Empire ;
, and preparations it is said, are making for the
rontinuaace of the war between that republic
and Great-Brifain. To me>. therefore, there
appears but little probability, that the depreda
tions on the cotnmtrce of the United States will
he lpeedily discontinued. An event so desira
ble, in a great measure depends on the iuccefs
of the commiflioners of the United States, now
at Paris, who are malting every effort in their
power to a by amicable negcciition, eur
causes of difference with the Fr<fttch republic :
But as-thrre can he no certainty, that the over
tures of a friendly adjustment wil) be fuccefsful,
ought we not to be prepared for difappeintment,
and m-et it with firmnefs ?
The commerce of the United States is too im
portant to bs negleifled; and lam persuaded it
will not fail of receiving all the protection and
support our national government can afford.-
The citizens .of Am rica love peace, and sin
cerely with to cultivate friendlhip with all na
Â« tions, But (hould neccffity (which Heaven for
bid) compel them to the lilt resort, the tame
undaunted spirit and firmnefs will be discovered
in the jiift defence of their independence, which
were sb confpicueus at the time it was obtained
This is a fubjeift of the highest importance,
and belongs I am sensible, to the government of
the, United States, whose meafure#, at this im
â¢ portant crisis, undoubtedly will be marked with
pi udeace, and pur'fued with firnmefs :âBut, let
me ask, is it Knt necefTary, under existing cif
cumflances, to evince to the world our readiness
to support such measures for the general wel
fare, as the government of the United States
fball fee fit to adopt ? Whilfl we are careful nit
/ to infringe on the rights of other governments,
we will he faithful to ouY own,
we have engaged to support, and to which we
are bound by every social and moral obligation.
The bnfinefs of legiflatian, for which you are
now more particularly convened, is both ardu
obs and important, and requires your careful
attention in framing such new laws, as you
nay judge necefTary fÂ«r the public good, and in
revising and amending those, which already
cxift j so that the citizen may find security
for every right, and redress for every wrong to
his person or property, in the molt easy and ex
peditions manner pofllble. It is unneceflary to
be particular on this fubjefl, because your en
s. lightened underflanding and discretion, will di
rest you to the wisest meafpres f<w 'J"
mentpii ihofc important objecls.
I have the highest fatisfaftion gentlemen,
in being able to inform you, that by state
ments exhibited to me by tlÂ»e late treasurer,
Mr. Davis, and by his fuccefTor, Mr. Cof
fin, ourpublis treasury appears to be in an
elligible situation. The debts due to the
Commonwealth, exclusive of those confid
Â«rcd aa doubtful, are quite fuffitient to dis
charge all just claims and demands on gov
ernment, of every defeription ; and a con
iiderable surplus will then remain for pub
lic exigencies. This (hews the effeft of the
plan adopted for the reduftion of our debt
and cannot fail of eneourageing you to per
severe in a system so obvioudy ' beneficial,
because it will enable the public tu difchargc
its debt, withoiit the ncceffity of any addi
tion to the usual taxes, which are requisite
for the support of government. Those
statements, I have directed to be laid be
> fore you, with the explanatory, ufeful ob
iervalions thereon, by the treasurer.
My official duty obliges me to mention,
that owing to the incompetency of the pre
sent legal compensations for services requir
ed, several vacancies have happened in some
of the important offices of the government
particularly in that of the judge of Pro.
bate, in the comity of Hancock. The ref
peftable gentleman who lately filled that
important office, ftated to me, that the
allowance established by law, is quite inef
ficient to bear the expences, of attending
the probate courts in that county, withoHt l
taking into consideration any allowance for
his time and services. Under such circum
stances, it is not probable the vacancy can
be suitably filled. You will therefore judge
whether the circumstances of that county
do not call for your particular attention.
Every servant of the public, is justly enti
tled to a revvard, adequate to the merit of
his services ; and in making legal eftablifh
mcnts for this purpose, fiiitable regard
should be bad to the enhanced prices of the
neceflaries of life. Whilst lam on this
fubjedt, I beg lelve to submit to your can
did consideration, whether it would not
better comport both with the letter 3nd
spirit of the conflitution, to annex perma
nent and honorable establishments to some
of the important offices therein mentioned;
rather than occafio'nally to afford relief by
temporary, additional grants. In your
wisdom and reftitude the people have placed j
a confidence, and lam persuaded they will ,
not be disappointed.
Agreeably to an ait of Coijgrefs, for the 1
more general promulgation of the laws pass- /
ed on the third day of March, 179J; I have 1
lately received from the Secretary of State, t
five hundred and eighty-eight setts of the i
laws ps the United States, cpnfifting ps t
three volumes eacli, being this Cpmmefi- c
wealth's prpportipn|of said lews,to be deposit- a
ed in such fixed and cpnvenient place in each t
county, or other civil fubprdinate division,
as the executive legislature (hall deem most f,
conducive to the general information of the si
people. It will, I conceive, be necessary n
for the legiflature'to make prdvifion for the
immediate distribution of those laws, among
the several towns or counties within thecom- li
monwealth, ;n such manner and under fucli ' E
j'eftridtions as may be thought best adapted j
' to carry into cfTeft the important and uCcfui
dfcfign of thf said aft.
I $ Other matters which may require "your
t consideration, I (hall communicate by pri
t vate message, and (hall mod cheerfully con
