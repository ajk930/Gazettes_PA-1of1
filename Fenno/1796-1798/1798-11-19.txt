THE following elegant delineation of tlie j
features of French fraternity, has just ! J
come to hand, from London. Coming as â 
it does from a man who embraced with j
enthusiasm, the early theories of the Re* i
yolutionizes, it aught to make a deep <
and lading impression ; and in this view, '
an extra number Â®f them has been struck '
off, for general difleminatien. This last 1
Phjfiognimical Efiay, will, in no mean de
gree, enhance the author's fame, at a j

deprarity, contained in the form of the j-
Gallic oligarchy, begins daily to meet j.
more and more the general abhorrence of
mankind. 0
REMONSTRANCE, j

Of THE c

AGAINST
The INVASION of SWITZERLAND. a '
BY JOHN CASPAR LAVATER,
Reftor at Zurich. r
âi ri
ADVERTISEMENT OF THE EDITOR. E
THE follmping very elegant and fpi- L
rittd Address to the French nation, was Â°'
lately transmitted by L A PATER, to Citi-
zen REtVBELL, the President of the Di- 31
reÃory, with an accompanying menace,
that, if he did not receive a fatisfattorv
and immediate answer,. it should be
publifhcd in three different languages. ro
R.EWBELL Kndefcended to reply; but the a 1
complexion of his answer may be judged of *â ''
by the fubfequeut proceedings of his brother
jti-lan, Citizen RaPINAT, the wanton an
barbarity and injuflice of -which, far fur- an
pass even the atrocity of those which form m '
the proper ob jells of this address. m
It should premised here, that the ve- S a
r.erable addresser has hod no fort of concern
in the publication of his forcible " Appeal," Â£ rc
as he calls it, to the great nation, and to tn
po/terhy: for it deserves, to be recorded in
the annals of Liberty, that no press through
tut regenerated Switzerland would have J u<
found it expedient or fnfe to print such a
defence of rational freedom.

LIBERTY, Equality, Rights of Man, ; wc
Ire the signs prefixed to all the decrees WÂ£
and proclamations of a people, which, in wc
tnore respeCts than one, may think itfclf co
entitled to a flume the epithet of la grand fl a
nation. It cannot, therefore, be deemed ws
criminal, if I address, to the celebrated ex
parent and guardian of liberty and hu- f re
inanity, a few words, at once manly and
tree. up
Many of the able and most enlight-
ened heads admire the atchievements of (;j 0
this pedple, considered as philosophers,
politicians and heroes. What other na- C j
Hon, ancient or modern, has performed ca ,
the actions which it has done ? Who m j
Could even believe that practicable which m<
it has effected ? He who does not m;
admire, mvft be ignorant of its deeds, wc
or have loft the faculty of admiration. gr (
It may, therefore, be justly, called the ha
great nation, for It has produced the 0 f
greateft,.and, I will still hope, the most
beneficial results ever produced, by man, Â«
in any periocLof time ! It is an univer- Â«
sal engine, designed by Godâit may fay, {yj
by Fate-âto transform things deemed un- Te
transformable. f a y
It is not for me, nor is it within my Â« ;
present purpose, to touch upon the un- Â«
accountable inconfifteilcies and contra
dictions, the horrid atts of injuftioe, ty- t } ic
ranny, and cruelty, of which the French f a u
nation, or rather some of its rulers,
have rendered themfdves guilty, in the j
course of the revolution. But the rights ca ]
of man, the rights of citizens, and, I ma
may add, the rights of pastors, for my f an

words on the conduit of the French na- we
tion, on its rulers and agents, with re- p O ,
fpeÂ£t to my country. Yo
All the inhabitants of Helvetia, net
deceived by juggling phrases, calculated mc
to deceive all, can entertain but one opi
nion. The tc*rorift power, whose iron
h'aml "bends down their necks to the
trfimpet-lounds of liberty, may ftifle their
voice, yet they all entertain hut one opi- j-j
pi onâthat," The French nation, which yf
" waged war for !Â£vjral years aga'mft the 35
" most powerful nations, for the pro
Â« feficd purpose, that no foreign power
"" " j'iKjuld interfere in its domestic con
" cerns, cannot derive the least right
" or fuccefs,in war, to interfere in our
" domestic concerns."

t cation, to exhaust -our poor innocent u
- country,. In other words, they forced up- ti
: on us the liberty of fiff (ring ourselves to be tl

It is now obvious to all, that the-conduft

hostilities. â The love of peace hath hiiberto
re/trained the authorities of the union from
such a (late of things. How long it will

Venetian co;,quellsâ from Zante, Corfu, at
Cephalonia,âfrom Malta, and probably m
even I orficS, on which the sublime Porte tr
has long fixed his eye. The fleet of Britain
hioMs undisputed empire from Gibraltar to B
the Dardanelles ; âNaples, railing her arm Ih
before, has now struck her vengeful blow ; all
the troubles in Ihe Holy See, in the Dutrhy
of Milan, in Genoa, in Piedmont and Savoy,
before formidable, have surmounted all ob
llacles and become paramount to the power th
' of the Freoci guards.' Encouraged by the in
â  Hrong co-operation of the king of Naples, lei
and the British fleet, a general l'tifurreiflion bi
