circnmftancts, but those 'we are acquainted
w'lth are frightful in the extreme ; the French
fcjuadron confifling of thirteen fail of the
line, one of which was a three decker of
120 guns, and three 80 gun (hips, were an
chored in line ofbattle, in the Bay of Abuck
ar or C.irroffa, the only one that exiftsin all
the roast of Egypt, for these eight days past
leveral fliipi -.i.J i't r> to the
Ehglilli, have at ditfereiu times been recon
noitering the polition of our fleet, so that
we. were in momentaiy expectation of being
attacked. Â»
" In a direst line from Abuckar to Ro.
letta, the distance is about four leagues and
half, from the heighth of tlie latter bur fleet
isperfeftly seen and distinguished, the 14th
of this month at half past five o'clock in the
evening we heard the firing of cannon, this
was the commencement of the battle ! we
immediately got up the Tenaces, the tops
of the highest houses and little eminences,
from whence we plainly distinguished re 11
En-lifh fail of the line, the others we
not lee ; the cannonading was very heavy
until about a quarter of nine o'clock, when
favored by the night we perceived an im
meitfe light, which announced to us that
some Ihip was on fire, the thunder of cannon
was heard with re-doubled fury, and the (hip
on fire blew up, with the most dreadful ex
piotio'i which was heard at Rofetta, in the
, Tame planner as the explosion of the Ganelle,.
wj.s heard at Paris when this accident hap
pened, the 1110 ft profound silence took place"
for the (pace of about ten minutes, from
the moment of the explosion, until our hear
ing it might' take up about two ; the
firing commenced again, and continued
without intermiifion until three o'clock
the morning, when it ceased almost entire
ly until five, when it commenced again with j
hs great vivacity as ever. I placed myfelf on
a tower, which is about a cannon (hot from
Rofetta, and which is ciflled Maudou, from
thence I could plainly fee the whole battle ;
at 8 o'clock I perceived a (hip on fire and in
about half an hour blew up similar to that last
night ; a (hip which until the moment of the
explolion was not perceived to be on (ire at
all. The other (hips moved to a greater dis
tance from the (hore, and the fire on board
her (apparently dismasted) by which we pre
sume that it was entirely diftinguiflied ; dur
ing this time the canonading redoubled ; a
a large (hip entirely dismasted was on (hore
coaft, I perceived others amongst the
fleet in similar manner dismasted, but the two
squadrons were so mingled amongst each other
that it was impossible to diftingui(h French
from Euglilh, nor on (hore whose fide the
advantage was.
-The firing continued with unavailing vi
vafity until about two o'clock after mid-day
of the 15th, at this hour we perceived two
fail of the line and two frigates under a press
of fail on a wind (landing to the eastward,
we perceived tbe whole four were under
French colours, no qther vefftl made any
movenenf, and the firing ceased entirely ;
towards fix o'clock in (he evening I return
ed to the tower about Mendau to reconnoi
tre pofition of the two fleets, it was the
fame as at 2 o'clock, the four (hips were a
breft of the mouth of the Nile.
'' We knew not to think or conjec
ture ; twenty-four ftours puffed without hav
ing any pyfon to gUe us any detail; in our
situation it wus impoCible to proceed any
ways by land oil of the- Arabs, â¢who
were assembled betweetl Rofetta and Abackar,
and by lea, on account of the difficulty in
getting out of the flailing of the branch of
the Nile. You nv.iy judge of our impatience
and perplexity 1 nothing good c.:uld be ac
quired from this Situation, however we were
obliged to pass tlie whole t>f this night in
j uncertainty: At lift in the morning of tlie
16th a boat which left Alexandria in the
night, gave us some detail though little tend
ing toourcoiufort. They told us that the
ofticersff the French fleet, who escaped in a
boat to Alexandria, had reported that in the
commencement of tlie battle, Admiral Bruyts
had yeceivtd three fevcre wounds, one in the
ijead and<wo in the body, that notwithftano
ing he persisted in keeping his station on the
arms cljefl, and that a fourth (hot took him
in the body and Cut him in two ! At the fame
momeUt a (hot took off Cafabianea ; that at
this time they perceived the (hip to be on (ire
in such a mannneras not to be able to extin
guish it, and at last that the (hip had blown
up at about j o'clooj at night ; they added
that our fleet was totally destroyed and loft,
with the exception of four ships escaped, but
that the remainder were totally ruined.
" I returned to the tower, where I found
things entirely in the fame situation as yester
day ; they were so even yesterday night and
this morning. I have now to fay how they
appeared from the Castle of Abuckar on the
left, sweeping the horizon to the right.
" 4 (hips were without masts, and under
Engli(h colours.
" jth and 6th are in good state, but cannot
distinguish thdir colours.
" The 4th has loft her mainmast, this morn
ing (he hoisted her foremoft (lay-fail, and fes
some after fail.
7th is without tap-gallant mill.
" isth is dismasted.
" 9th is dismasted with the exception of

and to raise her masts.

" This is all I can distinguish from which
results, that altho' the English have had the
advantage, they have been roughly handled
fioce they could not follow the vefTels that
went away on the ijth, for those two days
their (hips have been perfe&ly inactive and
feemiugly destroyed.
" This morning news has been brought
from Alexandria which confirms our losses.
Rear Admiral DiA-elh is killed, also Vice
Admiral BUnchquee Duc'naide ; five (hips
h**e struck their colours, the Le Taunant
was the last (hip in aflion, Deputilrr

by a cannon (hot ; the (hips that escaped are ,
the Le Guillaume Tell, and the Le Gene

Juflice : they fay it was the L'Artiuiefe,
that blew up yesterday morning, many things
relative to the battle we are still to learn
â¢ they fay that the Englifn Admiral hat sent
a flag of truce tQ Alexandria, demanding
that they should receive and take charge of
the wounded, which to 1500,
they will fend us all our prisoners, (as yet I
am ignorant of what has been decided up
on.)

Your readers will perceive that he does not
agrre with our jacobins. What flrange and
palpable obstinacy-is it that induces this

ExtraS of a letter, dated Paris, Sept. ID,
1783, Jlgned E. Franklin, isfc.
" We think we may rely on his (Mr.
Hartley) doing every thing in bis power to
influence his court, to do what they ought
to do ; but it does not appear they have as
yet formed any fettled fyltem for their con
duit relative to the United States. We can
rot but think that the late, and present af
pt& of affairs in ytmrrica, has had, and
continues to have ar. unfavorable etfeift, not
only in Britain, but thro' Europe. Inwlnt
ever light the article refpefting the tories,
may be received in America ; it is consider
ed in Europe, as very humiliating to Britain,
and therefore one which we ought in honor
to perform and fulfil, with the mod scrupu
lous regard rnd good faith, and 111 a manner
leajl ojfencive to the feelings of the king and
court of Great Britain, who upon that point
are extremely tender. The unreasonable and
unnecessary resolves of various to<tins, ou this
fubjedl, the acfhial expulfinn of tories from
some places, and the avowed implacability of
almost all who have published their senti
ments about the matter, are circumstances
which are conjlrued to the prejudice of our
government. Popular committees are consi
dered here as with us, in the light of fub
flitutes to conjlitutional government, and as
being only necsfTary in the interval between
the removal of the former and the ejlablijh
ment of the present. The conflitutions of
the different States have been translated and
published, and pains have been taken to
lsad Europe to believe, that the American
States, not only made their own laws, but
obeyed them ; but the continuance of popu
lar ajimilies, convened expressly to delibe
rate on matters proper only for the cogni
zance of the different legifixtures and officers
of government, and their proceeding, not on
ly to ordain, but enforce their resolutions, has
exceedingly lessened the dignity of the
States in the eyes of these nations."

'PHILADELPHIA,
SATURDAY SVENING, DECEMBER 8.
This Day, at 12 o'clock, The President
of the United St at es niet both Houses of
in the Representatives' Chamber,
and delivered the following Speech :
Gentlemen of the Senate and
Gentlemen of theHeufe Of Representatives,
While with reverence and re- 1
fignation we contemplate the dispensa
tions of Divine Providence, in the alarm
ing and deftruftive pestilence, with
which, fcveraf of our cities and towns
have been visited, therc # is cause for
gratitude and mutual congratulations,
that the malady has dl(appeared and
that we are 2gr.in permitted to aiTem
ble in fafety, at the Seat of Govern
ment, for the discharge of our import
ant duties. But when we reflect that
this fataldiforder has within a few years
made repeated ravages in some of our
principal sea ports, and with increased
malignancy, and when we consider the
' magnitude of the evils, arising from the
interruption of public and private bu
siness, whereby the National Interests are
deeply affefted ; I think it my duty to
invite the Legislature of the Union to
examine the expediency of establishing
suitable regulations, in aid of the health
laws of the refpeftivc States ; for these
being formed on the idea, that contagi
ous iicknefs may be communicatee] thro'
the channels of commerce, there seems
to be a neceflity, that Congress, who
atone can regulate trade, should frame
a system, which, while it may tend to
preserve the General Health, may be
compatible with the interests of commence
and the fafety of the revenue.
While we think on this calamity and
sympathize with the immediate fuffer
ers, we have abundant reason to present
to the Supreme Being our annual obla
tions of gratitude for a liberal participa
tion in the ordinary bleffirtgs of his pro
vidence. To the usual fubjefts of grati
tude, I cannot omit to add one of the
firft importance to our well being and
â¢ fafety : t I mean that spirit which has a
risen in our country, against the menaces
and aggrefiion of a Foreign Nation.â
A manly sense of National Honor, Dig
nity, and Independence has appeared,
which if encouraged and invigorated by
every branch of the Government, will
enable us to view undismayed, the en
terprizes of any Foreign Power, and be
come the sure foundation of national
prosperity and glory.
The course of the translations in re
lation to the United States '.id France,
which have come to my knowledge du
ring your recess, will be made the fubjeft
of a future communication.' That com
munication will confirm the ultimate
failure of the measures which have been
.taken by the Government of the United
States towards an amicable adjustment
of differences with that Power. You
will at the fame time perceive, that the
French Government appears solicitous I
to impress the*opinion, that it is averse
to a rupture with this country, and that
it has in a qualified mannfcr, declared it
felf willing to receive a Minister from
the United States, for the purpose of res
toring a good understanding. It is un
"fortunate for profeffions of this kind,
that they should be exprefled in terms,
which may countenance the inadmissible
pretension of a right to prescribe the
qualifications which a Minister from the
"United States should possess, and that
while France is asserting the existence of
a disposition on her part to conciliate
with sincerity the differences which have
arisen, the lincerity of a like disposition
on the part of the United States, of which
so many demonstrative proofs have been
given, should even be indireftly question
ed. It is also worthy of observation
that the decree of the Direftosy alledged
to be intended to restrain the depreda
tions of French eruifers on our com
merce, has not given and cannot give
any relief-, it enjoins them to conform
to all the law* of France relative to cruiz
ing and prizes, while these laws are,
themselves the sources of thedepredations
of which we have Jo long, so justly and
so fruitlefsly complained.
The law of France enafted in Ja
nuary la ft, which fubjefts to capture and 1
condemnation neutral vefiels and their
cargoes, if any portion of the latter are 1
of Britlfh fabric or produce, although t
*
%"
â¢
the entire p; an cttf belong so neutrals,
instead of being rescinded, has lately re
ceived a confirmation, by the failure of
a proposition for its repeal. While this
law, which is an unequivocal aft of war
on the commerce of the r:\tions it at
tacks, continues in force, tbofe nations
can fee in the French Government only
a power, regardless of their eflential
rights, of their Independence and Sov
,T' ereigntv, and if they poflefs the means, â¢
they can reconcile nothing with their in
-r, tereft and honor, but a firm refiftmce.
Hitherto therefore nothing is dif-'
coverable in 'the conduct of France,
, r which ought to change or relax our rnea
' fures of defenceâon the contrary to'ex
e- tend and invigorate them is our true po
a- licy. We have no reason to regret, that
n- these measures have been thus far adop
ih ted and pursued, and in proportion as
ns we enlarge cur view of the portentous
or and incalculable situation of Europe, we
is, shall discover new and cogent motives
id for the full devejopement* of our energies v
a- and resources.
n- But in demonstrating by our conduit
t- that we do not fear war in the necefiary
at proteftion of our rights; and honor, we
rs shall give no room to infer that we a
ur bandon the desire of peace. An efficient
;d preparation for war em alone insure
ie peace. â¢It is peace that we have uni
ic formfy and perfeveringly cultivated, j
u- and harmony between us and France
re may be restored at her option.â.
to But to fend another minister, with
to out more determinate afluranccs that
ig he would be received, would b.e an aft of,
th humiliation, to which the United States ,
fe ought not to submit. It must therefore j
;i- be left to France, if 1 she is indeed defir
o' ous of accommodation, to take the re
ns quifite steps. The United States will
10 steadily observe the maxims by which
ne they have hitherto been governed. They
to will refpeft the sacred rights of Embassy.
be And with a sincere difpofition'on the
ce part of France.tÂ© desist from hostility, to
make reparation for the injuries hereto
id fore inflicted on our commerce, and to
r- do justice in future, there will be no ob
it ftacle to the restoration of a friendly in
-- tercourfe. In making to you this de
a- claration I give a pledge to France and
3- the world that the Executive authority
i- of this country still adheres to the hu
ie mane and pacific policy which has inva
d riably governed its proceedings in confor
i- mity with the wishes of the other bran
is ches of the government and of the peo
â pie of the United States. But confi
-- dering the late manifeftations of her po
i, licy towards foreign nations, I deem it a
>y duty deliberately and solemnly to de
ill clare my opinion, that whether we ne
-- gotiate with her or not, vigorous prepar
e- ations for war will be alike indifpcnfible.
al These alone will give to us an tqual trea- >
ty, and ensure its observance.
e- Amonc the measures of preparation,
e, which appear expedient, I take the liber
u- ty to recall your attention to the Naval
ft establishment. The beneficial effefts
of the small naval armament, provided
te under the acts of the last session, are
:n known and acknowledged.âPerhaps no
:d country ever experienced more sudden
at and remarkable advantages from any
>u measure 0/ policy, than we have derived
ie from the arming for our maritime protec
is tion and defence. We ought, without
fe loss of time, to lay the foundation for an
it encreafe of our navy to a size fufficient
t- to guard our co&ft and protest our trade,
n Such a naval force, as it is doubtless in
f- the power of the Uijited States to create
1- and maintain, would also afford to them
1, the best means of general defence, by fa
s, cilitating the fa fe transportation of troops
e and stores to every part of our extensive
e coast. To accomplish this important ob
e jest, a prudent forefight requires that
it systematical measures be adopted for pro
>f curing at all times, the requiffte timber
e and other supplies. In what manner
e this shall be done I leave to your confi
n deration,
h I will now advert, gentlemen, to
n some matters of'lefs moment, but proper
1- to be communicated to the National ,
n Legislature.
d After the Spanish garrisons had e- ,
1- vacuated the posts they occupied at the
i- Natchez and Walnut Hills, the Com- ,
' e miflioner of the United States com- L
n menced his observations, to ascertain the ,
PÂ°' nt near the Miffiflippi, which termi- ]
natedthenorthernmoft part ofthe thirty- ,
is firft degree of north latitude. From ]
d thence he proceeded to run the bounda
ry line between the United States and |
t- Spain. He was afterwards joined by ,
d the Spanish Comirmfioner. when tjie -
r work of the former was confirmed ; and j
e they proceeded together to the demarka- '
1 tion of the line. Recent information ren- <
'I
.Â»
~ deri it probable,thai the Southern Indians,
either instigated to oppose the dcmarka
>f tion, or jealous of the consequences of
Is differing white people to run a line over
r lands, to which the Indian title had not
:- been extinguished, have, ere this time,
is flopped the progress of the Commiffion
y ers. And considering the mifchiefs
il which may result from continuing the
- demarkation, in opposition to the will of
!, * the Indian tribes, the great expense at
-! tending it, and that the boundaries
| which the Commiffior.ers have actually
â¢ eftablifhcd, probably extend at least as
I far as the Indian title has been extin
i- guifhed, it will perhaps become expe
dient and neceflary to suspend further
i- proceedings by recalling our Commif
tt fioner.
The Commissioners appointed in pur
,s fuance of the fifth article of the treaty
s of amity, commerce and navigation, be
e tween the' United States and hi; 13ritan
s nic Majesty, to determine what river was
s _ truly intended underjthe name of the ri
ver St. Croix, mentioned ia jthe Treaty
It of Peace, and forming a part of the boun
y dary therein described, have finally de
e cided that qucftion. One the twenty
- fifth of October, they made their declar
t ation that a river called Scodiac, which
e falls into Pafi'amaquoddy Cay, at its
- north-western quarter, was the true St.
L,: Croix intended in the Treaty of Peace,
e as far as its great fork, where one of its
- i streams comes from the westward and
- the other from the northward, and that
it the latter stream is the continuation of
if, the St. Croix to its source, This deci
:s | fion, it is tinderflood, will preclude all
e 1 contention among individual claimants,
- as it seems that the Schorftliac and its
- northern branch,, bound the grants of
[1 lands which have been made by the re
ti fpeiStive adjoining governments. A fub
y ordinate question however, it has been
. suggested, still remains to be determined,
e Between the mouth of the St. Croix, as
0 now fettled, and what is usually called
- the Bay of Fundy, lie a number of valu
d able Islands. The Commissioners have
- not continued the boundary lines through
- any channel of these Islands, and uniefs
- the Bay of Pafiamaquoddy be a part of
1 the Bay of Fundy, this further adjust
s ment of boundary will be neceiTary, But
it is apprehended that this will not be a
matter of any difficulty.
Such progress has been made in the
examination and decision of cases, of
capturesand condemnations of American
vessels which were the fubjeft of the se
venth article of the Treaty of Amity,
Commerce and Navigation, between the
United States and Great-Britainâthat it j
is supposed the Commissioners will be ;
able to bring their business to a condu- \
iion, in August of the ensuing year.
The Commissioners afting under the !
twenty-fifth Article of the Treaty bef* J
ween the United States and Spain, have
adjusted most of the claims of our citi
zens, for lofles sustained in confequcfice i
of their vessels and cargoes having been ,
taken by the fubjefts of his Catholic Ma
jesty, during the late war between France
and Spain.
Various circumstances have concur
red to delay the execution of the Law
for augmenting the Military Establish
ment. Among thefc, the desire of ob
taining the fulleft information to direst
the best fele&ion of officers. As this
t objeft will now be speedily accomplished,
. it is expe&ed that the railing ancj orga
i nizing of the troops will proceed with
; out obstacle and with effedt.
Â» Gentlemen of the House of Reprefentativcs,
I have directed an estimate of the ap-
propriations which will be neceflarv for
: 'he service of the ensuing year, to be laid
befbre you, accompanied with a view of
1 the Public Receipts and Expenditures
â  to a recent period. It will afford you
fatisfn&ion to infer the great extent and
folidity of the public resources from the
prosperous state of the Finances, notwith
standing the unexampled embarrafs
-1 ments which have attended commerce.
' ien you reflect on the conspicuous
1 examples of patriotism and liberality,
which have been exhibited by our mer
cantile fellow-citizens, and how great a
; proportion of the public resources de
pends on their enterprize, yon will na
turally consider whether their conve
nience cannot be promoted and reconci
led with the security of the revenne by a
revision of the system by which the col-
is at prelent regulated.
During your recess, measures have
been steadily pursued for effc&ing the
valuations and returns, directed by the
aft of the last session, preliminary to the
afT.-ffinent and collection of a diredt tax.
- No other delays or obflacles have been
experienced, except such as were expert
\
s, ed to arise from trie grot extent' of. cur
i- country, and the magnitude and novelty
sf cf the operation, and enough has been
:r acromplilhed to allure .a fulfillment of
at the views of the Lcgiflatnre,
e, | Gentlemen of the Senate, anrl
i- Gentknun of theHoufe of Reprefer.tat:ves.
fs I cannot close this address, without
te once mere adverting to our politicaL-fitu
)f ation and inculcating the eflcntial im- ,
t- portance of uniting in the Maintenance
-S of our dearest interests ; and I trust, that i
.y by the temper and wisdom of your pro
is ceedings, and by a harmony of measures,
i- we shall iecure to our country that
> weight and refpeft, to which it is so juft
r ly entitled.

v - FRUITS OF FRENCH* 4 DIPLOMATIC SKILL.''
â¢- The apparent Diplomatic train of the
French Government in this country, though
is numerous beyond all precedent or pL*a of ne
csllity,âhas composed but a {mall part of
her aftive and dire ft agency here. Volney,
y Lachaife, and ail hundred other spies have
been unremittingly engaged in preparing the
remote and unorganized parts ef tlji coun
try, for a r-volt from the Onion, and a subÂ»
jedtion to France. Tins revolt has rlt length
'- been brought about in the ftite of ICen-ucky.
b One Garrard, who seems to be Govern
s or of the state, appears to have b.. n the firft
mover in this ambitious projeft. In his
fpeech to the Legislature he tells them, they 1
â  > have a ri-.-'nt to censure the general govern- i
:s ment. This interference of his important
d ate ) he affirms to be now called forâthe !
Federal Legillature having violited the con- I
' uitution, by voting the Preiident with high â 
an d dangerous powers, and intrenching upon
- the prerogatives of the individual states. Af
-1 ter tnlf-ly aliening that an uncommon agita
. 1 tion of mind has been created by these mea
'' | fures in different parts of the United States,
s j this Governor proceeds in tfie following most"
if | atrocious ftram of misrepresentation and
t fallhood.
i " The " Aft concerning Aliens," is cal
j culated to produce effefts most strongly mark- |
n j ed with injustice and oppression, because the i
1. j exercise of the power given therein, depends j
S upon the dilcretion, or I may fay, the caprice !
j of an individual. Nothing but a general
I prevalence of hypocrisy among that numer
" â¢ ous class of jKrfons on whom this law is
e meant to operate, can prevent consequences
!l fÂ° much to be deprecated ;âfor they must
- s affeft an approbation of all the measures of
government, whatever be their genuine sen
timents concerning them, or by an honest '
- disclosure of their real opinion, expose them
t selves to be ruined by banishment, on the fe- ;
a cret representations of some interested and !
i officious informer, and without enjoying
even the shadow of that trial by jury so
e dear to ireemen. Nor can the fame law be
if regarded as any thing less than an artful, ;
Q , though effectual evalion of the proviflons of ,
; that article of the Federal Constitution which
withholds from congress the power of pro
> | hibiting the migration a.s well as importation
e of such pirfons as the ftat;s then existing
t j should think proper to admit, a provision of
e ' the higlieft importance to these states, whose
; population is not full, and who have a strong
" â  interest in welcoming the industrious ftrang
; er from every n' rt of the world.
e | " Anothcr4-i w the operation of which
_ J is more exteniive as.it refpeas the individu
' al, is entitled An act iii addition to the
e aft, entitled An aft i;,r the punishment of
- certain crimes against the Umti-d States,"
el w hicl) by fencing round the different bran-
ches of Government in their official capacity,
j with penal terrors, in a manner before un
kiyawn,. hath created a new crime against the
c Uoiited States, in a cafe where an interfer
ence on the part of the Legislature was ren
dered unconstitutional, by that clause which
forbids the cnafting of any law abridging the
v ' freedom of speech or of tlie press."
Here follows a patlage too weak and.con
. tcmptihle to merit muc.h attention.:
ed to tlie uneasiness which has disturbed the
s public mind :âfor whiltl the advancing con
, d'ltton of our agriculture and population,â
- the ample, thongh not profule state of our
. crops', and tjie promifoig profpefts disclosed
of a foreign market, strongly indicate our
pref?nt pr'ofperity, and afford well grounded
expeditions *of future greatness,âand open
abundant scope for tlie exercise of the most
grateful feelings towards the ruler of the uni
r yerfe ; a War, horrible in itis' nature and ru
-1 inous in its consequences, hangs over us :
f a War by which we cannot possibly gain any
5 advantages, but may loose every
ir valued by tVeemen -:âand if by our united
exertions, and thfe favor of i kind providence
1 we may be so to maintain our
independence â¢ 'it.,will r)t all eveirts, at an
. expence r.iidei v lucVi we ? and our posterity
must : oÃti, and in consequence of which we
may be rendered unable to envbilnter hereaf
â¢ tei'more formidable evils than any'with which
> we are at present threatened."
| This abominable speech, distinguished no
less- by the depravity of its sentiments, than
the most desperate folly produced forthwith
1 the following daring resolution, viz.
" That the several states composing the
United States of America, are not united on
the principle of unlimited submission to their
General Government ; but that by corapaft
under the style and title of a constitution for
l the United States and of amendments there
to, they conftitnted a General Government
for special purposes, delegated to that Gov
ernment certain definite powers, referring
each state to itfelf, the residuary mass of â 
right to their own feif Government; and
: that whenfoevpr the Genera] Gowrnment as
. fumes undelegated powers, its afts are unau
thoritative, void and of no force : that to
this compaft s;ach state acceded as a state.
and is an integral patty, its co-ftitea form
ing as to itft-lf, the cjther party. Thai
