M*. riÂ»sÂ»,
Seeing in your paper of F.riday lad, an thi
extraA from the Columbian Centinel, con- an
taining ftri&ures on a sermon preached by l* l
the Bishop of Norwich at the church of ra <
Saint Mary le Bow in Loudon, on (lie 17th ur
February lad, before the foeiety for propa- gr
gating the golpel in foreign parts 5 and con- of
ceiving that the author (who signs himfelf gr
"an American") has fallen full as short in po
candour, evinced as much partiality, and nu
deviated as widely from rectitude as the , no
English bifhwp, I, as an Englifhraan think | cu
myfelf entitled to animadveit upon him hi
with the mod unreserved freedom, not with j be
pevfonal inveftire, nor with any intention to , fel
undervalue the state of this country, but to of
pt event any one from Jlrutting in borrowed ln
plumes, and afluming that as exclusively their ed
own, which more rightfully belongs to a- an
nother. |
The love of our country as well as the
love of ourselves individually, is not only al- g 1
lowed as a privilege, but enforced as a du- I ''
ty, while it exceeds not those boundaries b<
which the general consent and welfare of "1
mankind have established : but nations en- t0
croaching on the rights and reputation of P<
nations, are as criminal as individuals de
fnmding caoh other ; and it is necefiary for w
" the preifervation of moral juftiee in the world | u
that every such attempt be checked before j â¢
it has time to operate. *
To open the avenues and facilitate the j 11
progress of knowledge, to promote the dif- c
covery and display the beauties of truth, to w
dissipate the fogs of prejudice and obftruft nr
the progress of error, ought to be the chief ll
objea of him who fuffers his fentimepts to ci
appear before the public : but I fear these Â»
purposes have been but little attended to by Â«
the American.
That " we have led the Americans from "
the lowed date of barbarity, from the dark- P
ed dages of ignorance, to the highest flages Â«
of civilization and mental improvements, n
is certainly a very unwarrantable assertion of "
the bishop's ; but the attempt to controvert "
one falfe position by setting up another e- t
qually unfounded, is a mode not the mod n
likely to produce convidtion. I can by no 11
means acquiesce in opinion with him who "
assertsâ" when in the early date of this d
country, we produced a Locke, a Newton,
a Pope and others of great reputation in the t
literary world, there never was a day from a
the fird emigration to" this country from "
Europe, that the body v>f the pepple oti our â¢'
ifiand possessed more light and information
in proportion to their numbers than the 11
people of these states colleftively. " A pro- ji
portionate number of the people of this <â 
' country have never had the fame leisure and '
opportunity to make equal advances ; their t
time has been too busily emp.oyed 1
lifhing and fecuriiig thetnfelves in their pof- >
sessions, and in the pursuits of trade and ag- ;
riculture to pay a proportioned degree of t
attention to science and literature ; and even 1
now it is by no means a principal concern 1
among you; few are able to boad of a regu
lar academical educationâthe soldier thinks j
it not very eflentialâthe wealthy farmer "
can bring up his sonÂ« to the plough with- <
without it, and your merchants are perfeft
ly fatitÃed if their children are qualified for '
a counting-house ; they think time spent in
the acquisition of farther knowledge as lod '
to trade and therefore ill employed. Where
as in England, not only the children of a ve- >
yy numerous nobility, and ft ill more nume
rous country gentlemen, but even of many
merchants are allowed fufficient time to com
pleat their collegiate studies, besides a vad
number more of whom it may be said learn
ing is their trade, who are brought up to no
other profeffion, and who depend solely up- 1
on their genius and their learning. There
are also more advantages arising from the
many large depositaries of antient wisdom ;
there are dronger inducements from fame,
and better profpe&s of reward ; for not
â¢withftanding what some (hallow hot brained
demagogues may fay of an English aridoc
racy, it may be judly affirmed, that they
have ever been proud to be the patrons of
genius, the promoters of science, the sup
porters of every mental exertion, and among
whom may be found many names who rank
. " S
foremoft in every walk of litetJÂ«tureÂ« But , won:
in what part of this country (hall we look it is
j for the Jsatrons of genius, who bring for- notii
i ward humble merit, cherish the infant blof- vav\
j foms of tade, and p*Â»duce the fruit of rna-
'turity? I know not where they are to be mak
found ; those charafters who have adorned , let 1
you, are not indebted for much encourage- j iag
mentâthey forced their way to eminence bv . iim't
their own native drength. Where is the irvor
disposition to promote arts and fcisnCes \ mea
Shall we seek it among those who know oier
not their value, who deem nothing of iat- but
*â¢ portance but the pursuit of gain, and before the
whom the sublimed flights of imagination ipe;
and the nobled labours of intellect are tri- tha
5 vial matters compared with the news upon aflr
change. The Americans are yet too young, not

some dronger marks of national charadfer, it of

His account of the state of literature in ch;
3 England at the time'when colonies were ef- th;
tablifhed here, is as erroneous as his charac- aw
ter of the fird settlers is exaggerated. Scho- cu

dantry in which learning was enveloped in
when it fird feebly dawned in Europe, be- to
gan gradually to be disused from the days co
of Roger Bacon in the v thirteenth century, C(
and continued wearing away with aecele- so]
rated rapidity as it approached the time of de
Locke, Newton, Boyle, Addifon, Pope, of
Swift, &c. See. when learning having over- na
powered the clouds that obfeured it, shone ga
â 5 forth in meridian fpkndour ; when so many bi
illustrious names adorned the literary hori- pr
zon, that it has been emphatically styled the in
1-9 " Augudan age of England" : yet faysthe B
American, "it was not till about the year Si
mh. 1720 that a laudable liberality prevailed in Si
our country, and only from then have we b<
'ES. been cenfidered as an enlightened people." la
With refpeft to those who fird pvojedled rc
an the forcing of settlements in this country, Mn
:on- and who obtained patents, and grants of it
by land, it mud be acknowledged " they were o
1 of men of learning and philosophy, and were b
7th urged by a aoble fpiritof enterpnfe, to effe& t
>pa- great and marvellous deeds But very few tl
: on- of those ever left England ; the real cmi- a
ifelf grants were principally compofcd of the fl
t in poor and the illiterate ; and a considerable g
and number of that puritannical race, who were 1;
the | not fuffered to propagate at home those pe- y
link I culiar religious tenets of which they were so n
him 1 bigottedly tenacious, and who, when they ii
vith became fufficiently powerful, proved them- j;
mto selves the furious and intolerant persecutors b
it to of others. These were they " whose learn- <]
>wed ' n g wa * nothing but fcholaitic duff, arrang- f
heir ed and improved to the firpport of bigotry I
o a . and fuperdition, in strong derogation'of phi- c
lofophy, and found reasoning." c
the It cannot be denied that this fydem has t
y al- given place lo more enlightened views, and 1
du- that a more general liberality of sentiment is j
aries becoming prevalent: but you began too late, r
eo f upon too confined a scale, and have met with i
1 en _ too many obftruftions, to have made a pro
n of portionate progress with the Englifli. Some
de- ' ew names, indeed, you have produced, of

REVIVAL OF THE CLCBS,
Garat, in the Confervatcr, a journal of
which he, Chenier and Dannou are the edi
tors, aocufes the legislative body of having |
done ton much and too little to crush the royal f
conspiracy : too much, because some men,
who do not properly belong to the class of
conspirators, have besn included io the de
cree of transportation. Too little, because /Â»
many who were known to b& chiefs, aa the
mort aftive promoters of the conspiracy are
still fuffered to Affile the Republican territe- I
ry. It is certain that the ftorrr. his not ex
tended beyond the horizon of Paris ; and
the traitors dispersed like weeds over the de
partments, and the royal clubs, particularly
the society of philanthropes and legitimate
sons have ofcaped unhurt. To counteraft ' <
these numerous royal clubs, who (hun the
light and deliberate in secrecy, there can be
no measure more effeÂ£hial than the re-eftab- (
lilhment of the coiiftitutiooal societies in
every part of the Republic. The dire&ing l
society of the capital, called the constitu
tional circle, Celebrated solemnly its feftora
tion on Saturday, in the garden of the Hotel
Montmorency,which the society has rented.
Benjamin Couftantpronounced on that ocea
fion, a fpeach well adapted to the solemnity
of thÂ« day. In the evening the front of the
large building towards the Seine, waÂ» beau
tifully illuminated. The day. of refloration
was likewise celebrated by the other Repub

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
FRIDAY, NOVOMBER 24.
Mr. Swanwick presented the petition of
Dr. John Lockman, a surgeon in the south
ern department of the army, stating that he
was now become a cripple, and praying for
relief. Referred to the committee of claims.
Mr. Harper moved that the house form
itfelf into a committee of the whole on the
speech of the President of the United St3tes.
The motion was agreed to, and Mr. Dent
was called to the The speech hav
ing been read by the ehairman,
Mr. Harper and after him Mr. Lyon
rose. The chairman determining the for
mer to have the precedence,
Mr. Harpp.r objjsrved, that.it had been
lifual for the house to present an address in
answer to the communications of the Presi
dent. He said he had in his hand the reso
lution which had heretofore been adopted,
which he should submit to the eonfideration
of the committee. . It was to the following
effeft :
" Resolved that a refptclful Address be pre
sented by the House. of Representatives to the
President of the United St .tes, in answer to
Lis Speech to both Houses of Congress at the
tommencement of the present session, containing
ajfurar.eet that the House will tale into consider-
Ation the various and important matteis recom
mended to their atteutior..
Mr. Lyon said, he was opposed to a re
foljtion of this kind. He had risen to have,
nlade a different one, hot the preference had
been given to the gentleman from South CÂ»r
olina. He wished to get rid of a debate of
ten or fourteen days about the wording of an
answer to the Prefident'* speech. He had
it in contemplation to have returned an an
swer direftly from the house, by appointing
a comnii' tee to inform the President they
were ready to go od with their bufincf* ;
as he wished also get rid of the trouble
feme and greatly derided cuflom of turning
put en masse to wait upon the President. If
he were in order, he would rend what he
intended to have moved.
The chairman declaring itwould be in or
der to read the proposition in his place, Mr.
Lyon read as follows :
" Resolved as the opinion of this Committee,
that the various fubjeds submitted to the eonfi
deration of Congress by the Prejident of the
, United States, in his fpeeeh to both Houses at
the commencement of the present fejfion, ought
to be taken into full and mature eonfideration by
this House, and proceeded on with that due at
tention ar.dd'fpatch, -which their refpeÃ'rve im
portance, and a jujl regard to the public intcrejl
nui j demand, and that a committee tjf members
be appointed to wait on the President, and in
tlx name of the House refpeflfully to assure him
of its ready co-operation with tlx other depart
ments of Government, in all such measures as
may be deemed advfeable for the, public good,
and to promote the peace, bappinefs, and welfare
of the United States."
Mr. HarpeÂ« supposed it was not neces
sary to use any arguments to shew the pro
priety of adopting the fame resolution which
had hitherto been thought proper. He be
lieved the occasions for innovation should be
evident and strong, before they were resort
ed to. He had never heard any reason, in
private or in public, for departing frop the
rule which had been laid down by their pre
df-effors. With refpeA to the propriety of
this -mode of proceeding, if it should be
called in question, be doubted not that there
iwere members present who would shew that
it was proper, and had been adopted after
serious eonfideration ; but the mode propo
feti having been the constant praftice since
tlh; adoption of the present government, was
a fufficient reason for continuing it. The
gentleman from Vermont had said " it was
a very troublesome and much derided cere
mony." With refpeft to its being trouble
some, that was the fault of gentlemen who
were opposed to the measure. They might
make objeftionsto every sentiment in anan
fwer, and by that means produce along de
bate ; otherwise the business would not be
a troublesome one. As to its being a deri
ded ceremony, he knew gentlenSn who had
caused themselves to be fubjeft* of derision
by their attempt* to deride it ; but whether
those attempts hats redounded to their own
honor, or made them appear ridiculous, he
left every one to decide.
Mr. Otis enquiredwhethcrtherefolution
of the gentleman just fat down was in order.
The Chairman replied, that the motion
of the gentleman from S. Carolina must firft
be decided upon.
It was then put and carried by 52 votes in
the affirmative.
TÂ£e committee then rose and reported the
resolution. The house took it up ; when
Mr. HAVENScalled forthe yeas and nays;
which having been agreed to,
Mr. Venable said, the yeas and nays hav
ing been determined to be taken, as he in
tended to vote in the negative, he thought
it necessary trf give his reasons for doing so.
He did not wish to enter into a long difcuf
fiori on the fubjeft at present. It was well
known, th'it the mode of proceeding in an
swering the address had accafioned confid er
ablc embarrassment in the House. It was
not out of any difrefpeft to the chief magis
trate, that he was opposed to it Th. gen
tleman from South-Carolina had said, that
except inconveniences had grown out of the
praftice, it ou jht not to be altered. If the
gentleman wom'd stand on thii ground, he
would pardon hvs vote. It was not from a
wish to innovate, that he wished the cuftcm
departed from,but because it' haÂ« been found
to be attended w;'i h real inconveniences. It
was well known, that hereto fore two or three
weeks bad been confumeJ in debating upon
anfvver to the speech, which he thought
an unnecessary wade of time, and delay of
public business. This he thought a ferioils
evil, and a fufÃcient reason for departing
from the former precedent, which was ef
tabliflied at a time when this inconvenience
was not seen. He was therefore, willing to
change it.
Mr. Lyon said, it did not argue much
for the age we lire in, that they were to fol
low euftoms, merely because they had been
established, which was all the reason the
gentleman from S. Carolina had given for
adopting his resolution. He thought the
gentleman last up had fhewnfofficient ground
for departing from the old praftice. lie
himfelf had attended to every argument he
had heard in that house and out ps it on the
fubjeft, in his favour, and he did not think
them of any weight.âHe fliuuld wish to
hear the reasons which gave rife to it. It
was his opinion that they ought not to be
bound by precedent,but every day endjavor
to do better than chey did the last.

Mr. Lyon (aid, the house had now de
termined upon an address. He would move
what he thought would be the proper form.
[He then read the fubflance of his refolu
tion.j
The Spea ker said it was not now in or- I
4er to fay what the address should be. The
gentleman might, after the committee was
appointed, make bis motion by way of in
ftruftion to the committee ; or when the ad
dress should be reported, he might move his
as a substitute.
Mr. Lyon questioned the opiwon of the
speaker, as to his being out of order.
The Speaker declared he was so ; if the
gentleman still thought otherwise, he might
appeal to the house.
Mr. Lyon submitted, and a committtee
of five was appointed to draft dn answer,
viz. MefTrs. Otis, Dawfon, Rutledge, Bay
ard and Baldwin.
Mr. Harper said, amongst the Mnfinifh
ed bnfinefs of last fefiion, there was a bill
for the more effeftual colleftion of certain
internal revenue*. He wished it to be com
mitted to a committee of the whole.
Mr. Gallatin said it was unufnal to go
into the eonfideration of a bill which origi
nated iiÂ» a former feflion, in this summary
way.
The Speaker said he wasaÃqut to ob
serve, that the resolution of the committee
ofrevifalatid unfinifhed business, which had
been agreed to, did comprize bills : they
must of course be proceeded with according
to the rule of the houfe'on that fubjeft,
which he read.
Mr. Harper consented, and withdrew
his motion.
Mr. Harper gave notice, that on Mon
day next, he should move for leave to bring
in a bill for establishing an uniform system
of bankrupt laws for the United States.
Mr. Venable moved that a committee
be appointed to consider whether aay and
what alterations are nÂ»-ffary in the law for
regulating foreign coins. He said very con
siderable loss had been experienced in diffe
rent parts of the country by foreigji coins,
particularly by French crowns, and he tho't
some regulation on this fubjeft was immedi
ately necessary.
Mr, Macoh and Mr. Harrison spoke
of the rreceflity of the measure, and a com
mittee of three was appointed.
Mr. Findley moved that the petition of
Benjamin Wells, colbftur in the western
part of Pennsylvania, for further redress for
injury sustained by the infurreftion, present
ed the other day, be referred te a feleft
committed. *
Mr. RfACON objefted to its being sent
to a special committee on the fame ground
as when it was prcfentedâcMr. Hartley
spoke in favour of a feleft committee on ac
count of the Angularity of the cafe, and
went into the merits ef the claimâMr.
Sitgreaves wished it on account of dis
patch, as the petitioner was waitingâ Mr.
Coit acknowledged the feleft committees
were generally more favourable to claims
than the ftatiding committee, but he did
not think this ought to make them depart
from their usual practice, particularly as the
rule of the house was express on this headâ <
[He read it] âMr. Gallatin was in fa- 1
Vour of a feleft committee, as the petition in
volved the question whether any farther re- t
lief ought to be granted to persons of this <
description. He did not wish this because '
he was in favor of farther recompenece, for
he, and the people in his part of the conn- <
try, thought there had been already more 1
than fufficient granted. He wished the <
question, however, to come into difcuflion,
and to have a decision ; and as the com- t
mittee of claims uniformly threw out all t
claims which were not founded upon some
law, they would certainly throw out this, as
it rather asked a favour, than dynatided a
right, he was in favour of its going into a 1
feleft committee. 1
The question was put on reference to
the committee of claims, and carried 38
to 37. I
Mr, Harjesi said, he should lay upon the
table some refo'utions refpefiimjr thp mode
of taking eviderrcfi in conteftrd ele&ion-,.
â  It would be rerolledletl, he said, that the
house had experienced great inconvenience
1 for want of some fixed mode of taking evi
dence in such cases. Persons had been o
bliged to attend here for inftrti&ions, they
bad gone back to take the evfdetice, and be
fore they could return, the session probably
had closed. To remedy this inconvenience,
1 it had been thought some permanent ir.ode
might be adopted,"so as to prevent these
1 double journies, and consequent expences.
The motion which he now submitted, was
brought forward in the session befor- last,
but postponed for want of time.
The resolutions were read, and commit
ted to a GommLcteeioÂ£the whole for Wed
nesday. â¢ :g bti

S. / s
as MILAN, September 8.
\ t We are on the eve of learning the greatest |
events, peace, or the mod a&ive renewal of
t. hostilities ag.iinft the Imperialists. General
J. Buonaparte has just passed in review all the
divffions of his army, and found them in
11 them in the best orderâanimated by the
fame feelings, he said, " Soldiers, in tvyo
â¢ months an honourable peace will recal you
to your fire fides, or you will be once more
in the heart of Austria, or under the walls
of Vienna." The French warriors cordial
ly viewed either perfpeftive. Meanwhile,
Buonaparte in lodged in a castle of the an
â * cient Doge of Venice, Martini, in the envi
rons of Godroipo, and not far from Udina,
where are the plenipotentiaries of Austria,
/â¢ Before his departure for Udina, he added
a new rnembejr, the citizen Brehi, formerly
t employed in the war offices to the dire&ory
of our republic, declaring, that he " be
lieved the little experience of those in admi
nistration rendered this aid necelTary." We
dill flatter ourselves with the greateil hope
of peace, as we are allured that gen. Buon
aparte belives he may dispense with the di
visions of generals Joubert and Maflena, by
prdering them to the interior of France to
pacify, they fay, and keep down the depart
ments of the South, ready to declare in fa
vorof royalty.âThe French troops in quar
'r tcr at Mantua have committed all kinds of
excefltrs ; they have pillaged the citizÂ«nÂ«
n and the inhabitants of the country, and car-
M ried off almaft every ueceffary of life.âThe
commandants Jiave at last rendered justice
to the numerous complaints addressed from
every quarter and given orders for do sol
â¢ diers to !eave their barracks. Murmuring
" at this order, some companies revolted, and
they were obliged to call in the cavalryand
some cannon to reduce the mutineers ; a
11 dozen of soldiers were shot and some officers
were degraded. Gen. Leclerc (hewed on
'this occasion much wisdom and firmnefs.â
This day all is quiet, and the discipline
1 constantly observed by the army of Italy,
Â» will not give way to insubordination and a -
narcby. A person named Giardinetti, who
y levied contributions in Italy, in the name
; and authority of Buonaparte, which he had
nevertheless not received, was beheaded here
on the 22d August. The ci-devant mar
) quis d'Entragues, who was kept here a pri
-1 foner, but to whom many favours were
: gtanted on his parold'honneur, has fled with
a woman, said a&ually to be his wife.â
This is the fame d'Entragues, the manu
. feript of whom was published on the events
of the 18th Fruftidor,

A mod inveterate Rheumatism and Lumbago
â  (occcationed by laying in a damp bed, when at
BruflVls, in the suit of Her Royal Highaefs ths
Dutches; of â Jnmberland) hasaffiiaid me eighteen
years. I have employed the firft medical gentle
men in London, and (although I derived no bene
fit) am bound to acknowledge my gratitude to se
veral of the nobility, who knew my deplorable si.
tuition, ana humanely sent me their phyucians; I
have also tried mod advertised medicines. At
length, fir, after eighteen years excruciating

its good effe&s, and have in frveral instances of
Rhenmatifms, Sprains, and Bruises, witnefled its

Sir, Dec. *O, 1795.
A severe stroke of the Palsy, fix months ago, de
prived me of my (peech, and the use of one fide.
In this desperate situation, Whitehead's Ejence ./
Mujlardwa very strongly recommended, and, I
thank God asfuccefsfully applied. By perfevcring
in its use a short time, I was completely re,lored,
and continue to enjoy the full and 'perfe<9 use of
my fiiculties, although near eighty years of age.
Yours, W. FRANCIS,

Mr. Francis has held a public situation at

JÂ« r . fan. 4, 1707
Tfpwari's of five years past I have been afflicted
with a most violent Rheumatic Affe<ftiÂ®n in my
head, which has baffled the flcill of the most emi
nent Physicians; fomcmonthi since I was induced
to try your Whitehead's Ejence of J am
now happy to inform you, it has done me essential
service.and I think it neeeffary to declare, no other
medicine ever gave me the fmalUft degree of relief.

August, 1705:
Mr. Middleton, of ChefterfieUt-ilreet, St. Ma
ry le-bone wasfo severely affli(9e!l with the Rheu
matic Gout, as to be unable to move m my bed for
fixmonths; his limbs were,enÂ«rmou(ly fwelled,a<>d
at length fiom exeeffive pain became quite black.
In this Hiftreffing situation h. ttÂ« induced ro wy
your Whitehead's Ejence cf Mvflard; the cffsiS far
exceeded the most sanguine expectation, his pain
was immediately alleviated, and his limbs returned
to their natural colour ; his appetite reflored, and
in a very iliort time he was enabled to leave his bed
and walk with crutches; and by a few weeks perÂ»
severance, was completely .restored to the full cn
! joynaent of porfeift health.
\* Mr. Middleton, with his son, repeatedly
called as fee got better, oa Mr. Johnfton, and de
clared that his life was utterly defpairedof.
Refpefled Sir, Nov. 6. lyof;
Palfing by a croud, in the fifth month of her
pregnancy, my nile received a dreadful blow on
her fide,- which apparently destroyed the life of the
infant ; after the most Ocilful advice, and trying
various remedies for two months, she still found
the symptoms increafeto an alarming degree : spit
ting of bloodâshortness of breathâ and othSfdif
agreeabls circumftrnces appeared from so violent a
bruise, afforded only the fatal appearance ol her
speedy dissolution. A friend to whom Ireland
her fad cafe, having experienced great benefit from
your Whitehead's Ejence if Mujlard, kindly present
ed me with a bottle ; to my uofpeakable l'atisfac
tion, it fpcdily relieved her from pain ; a lecond
bottle has removed every diYagreeablc symptom
and with the most heartfelt gratitude I inform you|
we have the happy profped of her long continuing
a living mother to our numerous family.

It you you would wilh to go into Cape Cod

the fouttwaÂ»d of Race-point, is what is called
Herring Cove, where you mÂ»y have good an

If bound into Cape Cod harbor, your course
from Race-point to Wood end, is S S E 6 miles

within half a mile of the (hore.
In beating iuto Cape-Cod harbor, you must
keep the callers (hore aboard, until you get in
