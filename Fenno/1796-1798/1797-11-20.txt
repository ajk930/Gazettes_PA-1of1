Dr. Clark, val. 1. page 151. in his ob- Â®

hot clitrates, observes : u^',l
st "So far as my obfervatipas go, X roust "an.
of fubferihe to Dr. Cleghorn's opinion. I Â«s 1
have frequently seen agues appear, when there 1 ua '
was no reason to irapu;e the cauic to mar/by ! Y â¢
effluvia ; but merely to contagion. Ihe sol- ve 0
lowing are a few of the many inftanees,
2d which might be adduced in support of this ot t
opinion. Several years ago I attended a la- OUw
" y dy in a palfv, who lived in a town wnere ' r <">
na ague.prevailed, .and was cenfined to a P HS '
three pair of stairs room : yet, nevertheless,
she took a tertian, whtre no oecafional cause ' no
6 could be imputed except contagions yU ,
i. " A few years after, a gentleman ill Qf mar '
the palsy, as also his fervaut maid, were at- cxtr
tacked with intermittents, and no other PÂ«*>
taufc could be assigned, except the-vrfit of a-
noiher maulfrrvunt, who lived in the coun- ban,
, . try who was ill of an agus. P ac
1 Â« A person ill of an ague visited a child, and
in a high and; airy situation ; and when the
the feverifh state began to fubfule, had much milt
intcrcourfe with it. The child in a few boa
days took the disease.
"An adult person whose habits and man- 0
ner of life, made him by no means fubjeft to K ' lr !
an intermittent, called upon a friend who cut)
was fwcating profufely ill the paroxysm of dut
a tertian. The effluvia arising from the ged
patient*, body, he said, he received by in-
fpiration ; the (cent, of which he never af
terwards could get rid of : In a few days
he was seized with an intermittent, with le- q"'
is vere quotidian paroxysms, attended tvith de- the
lirium, and great irritability of stomach. call
In the third paroxysm I visited him ; and he r- n
then appeared to be in so great danger, that uc
every measure was instantly niade use ot to or
break the force of the next fit ; which cor
succeeded; but he continued for some weeks as,
extremely weak. f Â°'
" Since I was elefted physician to the lev
Newcastle infirmary, in May 1788, I have >< n
had fix, inflances of agues being communicated. Â»ti
from one person to another by contagion.â
And .the fame thing has happened to iorae

' deftrudive to the imperial army in Hunga- tli
w n ry, spread by contagion ; became exceeding- qt
hirfs! ly mortal, and was propagated over Ger- U.
e and many, and great part of Europe. 1
Â« Dr. Schotte, a German phyfieian, Jup- Â«
m ex- poses that the contagion, which produced j"
nd an t j, e remittent fever at Senegal, ir, 1788, was b.
brought from Goree, by some black meffen- d,
' ment ger ; but Dt. Clark observes, that this
does not seem to be clearly ascertained i
for the remittent fever there, generally hap
wtf. ptns during the rainy season : hut when b
the rains are heavy and overflow the illand,
the fever affumcs a malignant continued e
H- form. . ,

, about 'of fynochus atrabiliofa ; but it appears to a
may be be precisely a remittent fever, of a malignant 1
nlo<!e " nature and indeed he confeffes, that it on- ; c
w 7 k J' lv differs in the beginning from the fever t
Z which is called bilious, or from that which 1
Â® goes by the name of yellow, by the fevcr^ty
Â»wftf 0 f its fvmtpoms."
. 1 Dr. Lind, in his " observations on t.ip
ed tÂ° diseases of hot climates," p. 118. observes,
I Phil a "sÂ« That the remarkable difiblution of the 1
! fpcedy blood, the violent hemorrhages, the black <

:m V P ' nfderize the yellow fever, are only acciden
tal appearances in the common feverof the
cutors VvVit-Indies. They are to be esteemed
' " mereh; as adventitious, in the fame manner,

f or . " the yellow fever is to.be considered, only, I of]

A friend has put into our hands a petition , na j
addressed by a large body of the merchants onci
of Nantz, to the Council of Five Hundred, feuj
in favour of the American commerce. â j mot
This was defigncd to counteract the effedts reft
of another petition presented by the mer- der
chants and owners of privateers, " praying g n
the council to fix with certainty the pohti- der
ctl and commercial relations between France jefi'<
and the United States, and-to put an end r y,
to the diversity of opinions <.n this import- pin,
ant fubjeit, whether among the members of
the Direflory, or the judiciary or the legif- con
lative body."
After anfwtring many declamatory paffa- to
ges in the firft petition, the merchants of
Nantz reply to the charge again ft the Arae- Stl
ricans, that they bad fold them a great deal va
of bad flour at exorbitant prices : This flour ma
they state, wat moft'y purchased by the dij
commiffarics of the republic, and that which f:s
was (hipped J>y private adventurers, wa3 o- ch.
pen to iufpeftionâllo frauds Were praÂ£tifed be
to obtain a high price. ThÂ« merchants pit
speak refpeftfully of the succours granted th
by our government and by private donations to,
to the refugees from the Colonies. yo t
In speaking of the arret of March 2d, so
they fay the .decree was partial, precipitate, efi
contradictory, and infuffic'unt. âPartial, by
involving many innocent persons, who had
no suspicion of their intentions. Precipi
tate, in requiring immediate execution of a
decree that ought tb have been notified to
American navigators, before fubje&mg
them to its penalties. Tt is certain fay they
that none of thera cÂ«uld fufpedt they had
occasion for the role of equipage in the form j-j
prescribed by that arret. The treaty of C(
1778 does not mention the role ; but a pad- j
port only, and the form to which the 27th t ,
article refers, appears to require 110 more t i
than the peffport by means of which a'l the
preliminary formalities are judged to be â
fulfilled, 'it is true, thsy fay, that"the molt Â°
eminent juries in France differ as to the reat t
â  sense of the formula.â-This (hould be a rea- ~
! son for judging the Americans with less fe- ,
â  verity. But, fay they, why have not the |,
1 Americans been notified that they were not r.
- in rule, when they were bringing corn to t
1 France and carrying on the French coasting
t trade. Men who have been so well rcceiv- c :
r ed ought not to expeft to be treated as en- j.
5 eniies, without a declaration of war.âThe f
- arret is contradidtory ; for an American cap- f
rt tain who meets no privateer and reaches a j
a French port, is received as a friend âbut
0 if he meets with a French privateer, he is
g taken and condemned.-;âlt is inefficient,
3 for tho designed to prevent fraud, it only
â¢. serves to conceal it the better.

a free access into the fertreffes of Tortons,
Alexandria, Ch'erafco, Ceva, and Cuneo,
s to an engineer officfr vrhom his majesty
may appoint, to infprft in person the works
which M. de Priocea supposes are carrying
on in these forts : and which, it fliould ap

The officers who shall be sent by his ma

on no works in the fortreffes of Piedmont;
that it is impofflble to be more pleased than
we are with the conduft of his majesty's

which may contribute to the tranquility and

A certain great body will in a few days

stung with the wrongs and indignities of an
injured country, affiime the attitude of
GLADIATORS or of MADMEN, it is
to be hoped we (hall not again fee othen in
the degrading and infultingattitudes of/buf
fers, Proteus's, French hirelings, and trai
tors.
The French Constitution of the third
year, or the third French Constitution, ne
ver received the approbation of the writers
in the Aurora. We know they are prin
cipled against every fyftcm but a put* de
mocracy, a government of one branch, like
that of Robespierre, or the former govern
ment of Pennsylvania.
The late tornado in France, which has
swept away the two representative branches
is therefore approved of by the Aurora, as
a return to a single branch government;
For tho it cannot now be called a represen
tative government, on a purely democratical
plan, yet it may be Queried whether more
than four or five men are not the efficient a
gents in any popular Jtngle branch govern
ment that ever was formed. If demagogues
did not believe, cr know this to be the cafe
they would never clamour for a fimplc de
mocracy.
While the war shall continue in Europe,
it is not probable, or scarcely poflible that
the United States can fuffer more than they
do at prefentby French depredation on their
commerce. It is to be feared from present
appearances, that France does not intend to
alter her couduft altho to an eye of reafonit
would appear that (he has much more to ex
peft from us by a just and honourable treat
ment especially while the war continues,
than by pursuing her present system.
Our government has at present but a
choice of difficulties ; either to interdict fo
reign commerce, or to permit our merchants
to arm. In the latter cafe we (hould pre
serve much property which is now plunder
ed from us by the picaroons in the Weft-In- ,
dies. In the former, we might make our
enemies fuffer, and might possibly bring
them to terms of justice ; but at an inealcu
lable facrifice. Government will probably
wait/the result of the pending negociations. j
All calculations on this point however baf- |
fle eonjedlure for things are'now ftraugely
ordered in France.
It ought never to be forgotten that the
enemies of the government of this country
have been uniform apologists for every atro- â 
city that has been perpetrated by the fuc
cefsfnl faftion of the day in France. They
are now in course, consigning the fallen vic
tims of the dominant fattion to obloquy. It
is to be observed. that while they attempt
to prove that these men were intriguing to !
restore monarchy, they implicate them in all ;
the principal measures adopted for the ex
termination of royalty. It the charaflert
given in the Aurora, of the transported depu
ties are just, it is evident that no men in the
nation would have had less to expeft from a
restoration of the Bourbon family to the
throne than they. If monarchy should ever
be restored in France, it can only be done by
means of the military. It appears that the
diredlory is the only branch of the govern
ment thit has intrigued with the armies.
To *hem the direftory ascribe their success
in the late contest with the legiflativebranch
es. Had the souncils succeeded by the
fame means, the Aurora writers would have
said that the Constitution of France, was
annihilated.
f Almost every member of tl;e Codicil of
"ori, who were ehofen for the new third last
spring, have had their feats vacated by the
directory, after holding them five or fix
months. This " extra-constitutional ftcp"
as the Autora would call it, was not taken,
till the sense of the army was *fctrtaintd.
The condemnacTon of the memhers of the
legiflattire of France, by the diredory, iw.th
oul trial, is juftified by thÂ« Aurora, 011 this
ground. " They would have been found in
nocent by the tribunals. The judges of
the tribunals in Franee"are appointed in the
fame manner, in 'which their legiflatiye coun
cils are, immediately by the people."
Tlus it appears, that the people of France
are not to he truded either in their eleflions
of legislators or judges. Can it be believ
ed that a few royaliits have in almost every
instance coatrouled the fir It free elfidtions un
der the constitution of the third year ? No
âthe mod natural, the molt obvious reflec
tion is, that the people of France ivifh for
peace, and a state of internal security, which
seven year's exparience have (hewn them, it
is vafn to expedl so long as their public af
fairs art bandied about from faction to fac
tion. Hence their, election of luch men as
judges and legislators, who were laboring to
bring about peace, in a conititutional way.
For this, they are proferibtd and banished,
without the forms of jultice.
