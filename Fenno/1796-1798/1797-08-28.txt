EXECUTION OF PARKER, THE
MUTINEER.
On FtiJay, June 50, 1797.
Friday morning, at 8 o'clock, A. M. a
gjhu was fire* frotn on board Hi) majesty's
imp x. tSXm, ij'Tng off the gaiVifoa, Vice
Admiral Lutwidge's flag-(hip, and the yel
low flag, the signal of capital punishment,
was hoisted, â¢ which was immediately repeat
ed by the Sandwich hoisting the fame co
lour on her. foretop. The Sandwich was
(Vationed rather above Blackftakes, tlpe
headmolt (hip in the fleet. The garrison,
on the gun firing, were immedictely under
arms, eonfifting of the East and Weft York,
Weft Norfolk Militia ; a corps of invalids,
and a train of artillery ; all of which, with
fixed bayonets, marched out of Sally-Port
Gate, with their colours flying, and pro
ceeded in single files, along the South (hore
of the Medway, near to Queenboroiigh, In
order to be fpeftators of the eventâall the
barrier gates of the garrison were fhut,
and each (hip in the fleet at this time lept a
boat off with a Lieutenant and a party of
marines to attend the Sandwich : the crews
of all were piped to the forecaftle, and the
marines drawn up on the quarter-decks, to
be witnesses of the execution. Parker, who
had taken his usual repast in the birth allot
ted him in the gun-room, and passed the
night in grjat composure, was awaked a
little after 6 o ( 'clock from a found by
the Marshal Provost, who witlf a file of ma
rines, composed his guard ; he arose with
cheerfulnefs, and requested permiffiori might
be alked for a barber to attend him, whieh
was granted : he soon dressed himfelf in a
neat suit of mourning, (waistcoat except
ed) sent him by a friend of the name of
Templor, wearing his half boots over a pair
of bkek silk (lockings : he then took his
breakfaft, talked of a will he ha
in which he had bequeathed hia, wifCa little
estate he said ht. wa9heirto; after that,
lamented the .misfortune that had it.en bro't
on the country by the mutiny, but solemn
ly denied having the lead connexion or cer
refpondence with any difaffedted persons on
(hore, ar.d declared that it was chiefly owing
to him that the (hips had not been carried
into the enemy's parts. 1 * s
At half after 8, he was told the Chaplain
of the (hip was ready to attend him to pray
ers upon the quarter-deck, which he imme
diately ascended uncovered. A' hiÂ«firft en
trance upon deck, he looked a little paler
than common, but soon recovered his usual
completion : he bowed to the officers, and
a chair being allowed him, he fat dawn a
few morqents, and steadily surveyed the mi
litary array of marines under arms round
the deck : Tie then arose and told the Cler
gyman he was ready to attend him ; the
Chaplain informed him he had selected two
psalms appropriate to his Gtuatiqn ; to
which the prisoner assenting said, "and with
your permiflion fir I will add a third," aud
named the 51ft, that" beautiful confedional
of David, and imploring of forgivenefs,
"'Have mercy upon me O God, after thy
goodn<i% according to thÂ» multitude of thy
mercies do away mine offences !" &c. He
then recited each alternate vcrfe, in a m3n
â¢ ner peculiarly impressive. At 9 o'clock the
preparatory, gun was fired from L'Efpion,
winch he heard without the smallest emo
tion. Prayers being soon after closed, he
rose and a(ked capt. Moss " if he might be
indulged with a glass of white wine ?" which
feeing immediately granted, lifting up his
eyes, he exclaimedâ" I drink firft to the
salvation of my foul !âand next to the for
givenefs of all my enemiss !"âAddreffing
himfelf to captoin Moss, he said " he hop
ed he would ftiake hands with him"; which
the capt. did ; he then desired " that he
might be remembered to his companions on
board the Neptune, with his last dying en
treaty to them, to prepare for their destiny,
and refrain from unbecoming levity !"âHis
arms being now bound, the solemn proces
sion moved from the quarter deckto the fore
caftle, iu the following order :
1. The Boatswain and Mates.
2. The Provost Marshall; his fvvord in one
and the halter in the other.
3. Captain Clerk of the Sandwich, bear
ing the warrant of execution under the feil
of the Vice Admiral.
!â¢ ' ,
4- The Rev. WTr. Atherton, Chaplain of
the Sandwich, in his robes.
5. The Prisoner in mourning, walking
with a firm deportment.
6. The Ship's Master of Arms, with his
drawn cutlass.
7. Captain Moss and his officers, with
two of three other gentlemen, who were
admitted on board.
The whole parted through a double file
of marines on the starboard lide to the plat
form ere&ed on the cat head, with an ele
vated projedlioir. Arriving there he knelt
with the and joined in some de
vout ejaculations ; to all of which, he re
peated loudly " Amen !"âRifing again,
the admiral's warrant of execution, address
ed to Captain Moss, was now read by the
clerk, in which the fentcncc ps the court
martir.l. Order of the'board, admiralty, and
his majesty's approbation of the wh le pro
ceedirigi were fully recited, which the pri
soner heard with great attention, and bowed
his head, as if an a (Tent, at the close of it.
He now alked the captain, " whether
he alight speak f" and immediately appre
hended his intention might be misconceived,
he added, " I am not going, Sir, to ad
dress the whole fhip'a company ! âI vvifli
only to declare, that I acknowledge the
justice of the sentence under which I fuffer,
and I hope my d?ath may be deemed a fuf
ficient atonement, and save the lives of
others !"âHe now requested a minute to
recoll-ft him/elf, and knelt down alone
about that space of time : then rising up,
" I am ready !"âand holding his head with
connderable dignity, said to the Boatswain's
Mate, " take off my handkerchief," (of
black silk) which,being done, the Marlhal
Provost placed the halter over v his head
(which had been prepared with grease), but
doing it aukwardly, the prisoner said rather
pettishly to the Boatswain's Mate," Do you
do it, for he seems to know nothing about
it !" The halter was then spliced to the
reeved rope : ill this being adjusted, the
Mr.rfh al attempted to put ft cap on, which
b* refufed : but otl bekg told It was indis
pensable, he submitted, rcquelling it might
not be pulled over his eyes till he desired it:
He thfn turned quite round, firft
time, and gave a steady look at his ship
mates on the forecaftle, and with an affe&l-'
onate kind of smile nodded his head, and
, said, " Good by to you !" He now said
' Captain Moss, is the gun primed ?' ' It
is.' ' Is the match light ?' ' All is rea
dy.' On this he advanced a little, and said,
' Will any gentleman be so good as to lend
me a white handkerchief for the signal ?'
After some little pause, a gentleman step
ped forward and gave him one ; to whom
bowing, he returned him thanks He now
alcended the platform, repeated the fame
question about the gun, evidently to gain the
time he wished for the pcrfefl completion of
what lie had preconcerted in his own mind,
then the cap keing drawn over his face,
walked by firm degrees up to the extremety
of the fcaffold, he dropped his handkerchief,
put his hands in his coat pockets with great
rapidity, and at the moment as he was
springing off, the fatal bow-gun fired, and
the reeve-rope catching him, run hifn iÂ»p,
though not with great velocity to the yard
arm !âWhen suspended about midway, by
the elasticity of the rope, hit body appeared
convulsed for a few seconds, immediately a(f
ter which no appearance of life remained.
It being tide of ebb, the starboard yard
arm - pointed to the isle of Grain, where
fcaftolding was erefted for spectators 011
(hore : a considerable number of yatchts,
qutters, and other craft surrounded the
Sandwich : the last time the prisoner knelt
with the Chaplain at the Cat head, though
he made his responses regularly, his attention
was particularly dire&ed the whole time to
the armed boats of the fleet, which were
plying round on duty ! The whole conduct
I of this awful ceremony was extremely deco
| rous and impressive it was evident, from
the countenances of the crew of the Sand
wich, that the general feeling for the fate
of their tnutiuous conductor was such as
might be wi!hed ; nor a wordâand scarce a
whisper was heard among them.
The instant he was visible to the garrif n
at the yard arm, the telegraph was put in
motiou to announce it to the admiralty ; and
j from the clearness of the atmosphere and
j quicKness of workin , the advice must have
been received in seven minutes. ,
He fuffered exactly at half pad ninfc, and
was lowered down, after hanging at the
yard arm a full hour, when' the yellow flag
was struck, and his body immediately put iu
to a (hell that had been prepared for it with
all his clothes on : and soon after it was
taken in one of the Sandwich's boats and
rowed to the east point of the garrison, and
there being landed, was carried to the New
Naval Gate, leading to Minster.âThe cof
fin-lid was here taken off to the fpe&ators
for a few minutes ; his countenance appear
ed, not much altered, but his eyes were wjde
open. His body was however after
wards taken up by his friends and bro't
to London. It was on Sunday lying at a
house in Rosemary-lane near the tower.
Parker was about thirty-three year* of
age, five feet ten inches high, and well made;
hrs complexion, eyes and hair darkâhis
nose prominent, and his countenance et
prefiive and manly. He had spent molt of
his life at sea.

Ipthe fitting of the J 2th June, Paftoret
called the attention of the council of 500 to
the political fituatipn of France and the
United States of America. Adverting to

for a message to the Diieftory, requirin|-
an account of the political situation of
France, considered. in relation to the Unit

sent to the committee appointed to eonfider
how far the Legislative Body can annul the

The blockade of Cadiz, by the'fleet un

is the mod complete and glorious a thing
that the na.val annals of this or any country

battle across the harbor of Cadiz, which
contains about 56 Tail of the Spanilh line,
the British fleet confiding only of 25. Our
fleets also block up the French and Dutck

Thelaft dispatches from the Directory an

tend the conferences on' the part of Spain,
and that Commissioners were alft named for
the Batavian Republic. The Directory
transmitted at the fame time a proclamation
of the municipality of Lisle, announcing the
preparations for the Congress, by which it
appears that they are to be received with thÂ«
utmost pomp of military honor, and. bath
the English and French commifiarieg to be
constantly attended by a guard. The ex

Government received Dispatches yester
day from Rear Admiral" Duncan, flaring,
that he was then at anchor withir*2 leagues
of the Dutch fleet in the Texel, which dis
played 33 pendants ; and that he had-re
ceived unquestionable advice, that French
and Dutch troops, to the anaount of 75,000
men, were cantoned and encamped on that
part of the coast a few days before ; a con
siderable part of which had been embarked on
bcvard the Englifh admiral
pretfe6 for an immediate reinforcement.
An article from BriifTels, of the 25th ps
June, fays, that by letters from the Hague,
it appears that*at the moment when thf Ba
tavian Republic expected to receive theVewa
of the failing of the Dutch fleet f/om the
Texel, with a numerous convoy d? trans
ports, filled with troops, arms, and ammu
nition, they were surprized to receive intel
ligence that that road nvas entirely blocked
up by the English squadron under the orders
of admira' Duncan. A cutter which went
outto reconnoitre the numberof the English,
fell into their hands- Thus every hope of
an expedition against England is for the pre
fect destroyed. This armament-has absorb
ed the most valuable resources of the Batavi
an nation, and will produce.no good.

We also received this morning Bruffel's
papers to the 3 th ult.
In an article from Vienna of the 18th ult.
we find a speech attributed Buonaparte,
wi which he fays -that he had no objection to
the Mihnefe forming an independent repub
lic ; but that it was their hnfinefs to consider
how far they could defend themselves againfl
the house of Auflria. From this conversa
tion it wis conjeftured, that the Court of
Vienna would recover Milan ; and what ad
ded to the' supposition that the Milanese
Wi're desirous of returning tc! the fubje&ion
of the Emperor was, that four de utie* from
Milan had arrived at Vienna, where they
had been well received by Baron Thugut,
and had on the 12th Â«n audience with the
jEmperOr.
% The Impartial European of the 28th ult.
contain* the following article :
" We are. this tryoment assured, that jt is !
reported through different Swiss .Cantons, j
that the negociations of peace between '
France and thÂ« Emperor are brokea off, and
that hostilities are on the point of commen
cing.
" The Swiss, who appear to have been
apprehensive that Buonaparte would march
ag?inft their Cantons, have perhaps spread
this report' to quiet the uneasiness of the
people ; since they ar sure that the threats
of Bnonaparte will be attended with no
effeÂ£t. t
" What appears to give credit to this re
port is, the arrival of several Piedmontefe
agents in Switzerland, wlo purchase horses
at any price for the cavalry of the King of
Sardinia ; it is, hi faft more thau probable
that if the war with Auflria commences,
this Prince will be obliged to furnifh the
contingent which he has undertakeu bythe
treaty to furnifh. We are, however, dis
posed to believe that these horses are destined
for some other purpose, and that this bad
news will not be considered."

AFFAIRS OF IRELAND. <
The lad accounts from Ireland are cer- i
tainly. of an alarming nature, in as much as t
they shew that the ratifications of the con
federacy distinguished by the name of Unit- :
cd Irishmen, are g'n reality infinitely more f
cxtenfive than even the reports of the two f
honfes of Parliament in Ireland on this sub- s
jedl had laught us to believe. c
From these reports we were induced to
think the conspiracy was confined, or near
ly so, to the province of UMler ; we find
iiqw, however, that it has travelled to the t
Other extremities of the kingdom, and gain- J
ed numerous proselytes both in the south & t
the weft. ' f
The difcovcry made in the camp at Bau
ion, in the county of Cork, has but too t
i clearly established the melancholy truth
1 and-opened a -gloomy to thof
: who contemplate the'political ,fituatiof) o
â  affairs in Ireland.
The plan laid by the confpiratores afford
i the greatest ground for alarm, as it was'no
a sudden elullition of difconten or ill will
but a cool deliberate delignj exery part o
, vvhich denotes system, reflection, combina
i tion, and talertts. In a word, every thinj
â  was conducted with so much secrecy, anc
every precaution which was to thi
fuccefft of a great and dangerous enter prize
was so well taken, that had not an accom
plice, either from remorse of conscience, 01
hope of reward, betrayed his associate* and
revealed the plot, the confequenje mnf
have been such as would have made huma
nity shudder,""and perhaps haw in a higl
degree endangered the interest of the Bri
tilh empire.
In the camp at Bandon were Rationed his
j majesty's 30m regiment of foot, a battalior
of militia, attached to it, and the count)
j of Leitrim regiment of militia, making it
! the whole 1500 men.
j At no very great difiance from this camp
1 are two others in the fame county, (Cork]
of which is st Ratnoormuofc. A- com
muoication was opened between the privates
of the militia Rationed in all here, and a
regular plan of operations was digested by
them, for counteracting those pursued by
government in- the North, for the extirpa
tion of the principles that bound together
the members of the society of United Irifh
mci .
The only part of the plan which has yet
transpired, is this, that on the ifl day of
this month, ar an honr agreed upon, the
men were to rife in all the three camp*, put
their officers to death together, with the
regulars who should oppose them, and make
themselves mailers of all the floret, ammu
nition, &rms and artillery. This being ef
fected, they were to rahe the fbndard* of
United .Irishmen, and invite all the friend*
of their Cause in every part of the kingdom
to repair to it. ,The 30th regiment in par
ticular, it is said, was marked out for dÂ«-
flruftion. on account of the fleady loyalty
they had displayed in seconding the itieafures
of government for disarming and apprehend
ing United Irishmen. We haxe heard, how
ever, that the massacre ' was not to have
been extended beyond the commissioned
non commissioned officers.
This plot, as our readers already know,
was dWcovered by a private of the Dublin
militia ; and in consequenCe of hi* informa
rion, between 30 and 40 soldiers of the
Bandon camp were secured, who, were des
cribed as the ringleaders, or mod aftive
agents in thebufinef*, as were also some of
the country people, who were represented
as having been the means of communication
between the different camps.
The extent of the conspiracy greatly
alarmed governmentâit was resolved, after
some deliberation thrt a dardon should be
granted to all the conspirators who were not
then in cuflody, on condition that they ab
jured the principle* of United Irifhment,
and took anew the oath of allegiance to hi*
majefly.
On this occasion Gen. Dalrymple, who
officially made the offer of pardon, saw
whole companies advance in bodie- to avail
themselves of the offer ; thu* proclaiming,
by their abjuration, that they were, or at
leafl had been United Irishmen.
If any man think* that the mi'chief is at
an end, and that this new security, taken for
their allegiance, is a firm pledge of their fu
ture loyalty, and of the public tranquility,
he mull- be credulous to a moll unpardona
ble degree âfor what reliance can be placed
on the oath* of men, who have already
broke the mofl sacred and solemn engage
ments ?â-"Not to fay any thing of their en
gagement confirmed by oath to the society
of United Irishmen, they could not have
entered into the conspiracy which has been
so lately Jete&ed and defeated, without a
deliberate breach of the oath of allegiance
which they took at the time they were en
listed or embodied. Surely the repeated
breaches of the moll fee red obligations, can
not afford a rational ground for hope, that
those who have hitherto disregarded and
trampled upon oaths, will in future be reli
gions observers of them. Those who are
capable of entertaining such a hope, are not
qualified for the office of statesmen.
Oaths never have beeu, and never will be,
as binding on the multitude as felf-interejl.
Make it the interest of men to be true to
you, and you need not think of eXafting an
oath of fidelity from them.
Thi* system mud at lafl be pursued with
refpetl to Ireland. The government of
that country mull undergo a very Conlidera
ble change, before any reasonable hope or
lasting tranquility can be entertained.â
Neither England. nor-Irelqnd'can afford to
keep a large army conftatitly ok foot in the
latter kingdom ; and if it be the prtffure of
military force that alone keep* down the
spirit of infurre&iÂ«m, we may naturally ex
pedl ,it will rife when that pressure is with
drawn.
Away then with force ; let the govern
ment be established where alonfc it ought to
Hand for the hearts and affections of the peo
ple ; and should oiie'turbulent and seditious
man then grefume to disturb the tranquility
of the country, twenty of hi* neighbours
would appear to secure and bring him to s
condign punishment.
Far as the present feflion of parliament is
advanced in Ireland, as well as here, some
fleps ought to be taken before the recess,
for tranquilizing that diflraCted kingdem :
and the preliminary flep should be, a change
of the lord lieutenant and his advisers.
PARIS, Juty 1.
The executive directory ?ent a day or
two ago to the minister ofpolice, to know
if it was true, that there existed clubs in
different quarters of Paris. Cochon re
turned for answer, that he was already in
the knowledge of the existence of more
' than fifty, and that new ones were eve
â¢ ry day forming. They add, that the df
reftory, after deliberating a quarter of
art hour, called in the minister again, and
gave him directions to redouble his vigi
. lance, because the directory could not
fuffer any anarchical club;;.
Nothing coujd be more wife than this
determination but so vague an order
must rather puzzle than enlighten the
minister ps police, since anarchy maybe
brought about in a variety of ways. The
jacobins are endeavoring to introduce it ;
the royalists are at work at it : and the
ambitious dream.of it. Each party hopes
to find his account in it, although it has
hitherto only proved their graves. It is
almost in the essence of clubs to lead to
anarchy, because every great assembly of
men has a tendency to acquire dominion,
and because the powers which they as
sume to themselves, is stolen from that
which Ihould belong to the legislative bo
dy. Clubs may for a moment assist gov
ernment, but they ultimately make it
pay deah for the aid which they lend it
by the yoke which they impoie on it,
Besides, how can the directory hinder
one party from holding clubs, if it gives
permission to another ? We now hear of
jacobin clubs, directorial clubs, and
revolutionary clubs ; they will not it is
true, give themselves these titles, but they
will have the fame tendency and the fame
objects in view. The only method of
preventing this, to pass, according to
the spirit of the constitution, a law which
iftall put an end to them altogether. '
It is thought that tfle{fireÂ£tbry, by gi

Maret, the plenipotenliary," who had
remained behind at Paris, set off for
Lille yesterday.
We are allured, that the majority oÂ£
the directory are sensible of the neceffi
of agreeing with the legislative body, in
order to prevent a ruptute dangerous to
all parties, to strengthen the cause of the
sincere friends to the constitution, and
to bring about a union which is at pres
ent so neceflVy for resistance to attacks
of all factions.

ftruÂ£tions which were given to the ad
miral. These are dated on the loth of
November, , 179Â£; the admiral did not
fail till the February following, yet no
change was made in these inftruftions,

been received of the English having
made themselves matters .of the Cape.

Letters from Milan, of the 12th ult,

by the Marquis di Gallo and Count
Meerfeldt, on the one fide, aud Generals
Buonaparte and Clark, of the other; af
ter which Count Meerfeldt set off for

quence of an arrangement agreed on be

Auftrians have left the Tyroffor Bavaria,
which it is known, has long been coveted
- by the House of Austria. The length

; ed for the cession of the Low Countries
â¢ and 'of Lombardy, by poffeiTions nearer
'J home, and which will render the House
' of Austria more powerful and more for
: midable than ever. It is in T aly that
, the most important affairs of Europe are
â¢ conducted with secrecy ; that the fate of

i republics are created and destroyed, are
mingled arid divided and their
constitutions, governments, &c. deter
mined on. It is there that the House of
Austria, having up. arms to destroy

turn amongst them, after the discharge of
your duties as their representative : In that
discharge we have been ever ready toexpreft

marks of our regard for your public and
private charafter.
We are sensible, fir, that with us yon
must have ftrongty experienced the mo ft
painfnl sensations on the momentous ques
tions lately agitated in congress .â¢ but in
cases of such doubt <and difficulty, you were
left to the iudependent exercise of your own
judgment ; your use of which, has in every
instance heightened our confidence.
With that deferende we ought to pay in
matters of politics, to the opinion pf. others
our fellow-citizensâbe assured, fir, we
cord with those represented by ybu, at the
late session of congress.
To which Mr. Grove replied t
Accept, friends and fellow-citizens, the
sincere thanks of a heart glowing with gra
titude, for this new evidence of your friend
ly attachment and regard.
Your approbation of my condudt in con
gress, gives me reasonable hope, that that
conduit is not displeasing to my constituents
in general.
With you I have ibdeed felt painful anxi
eties on some of the momentous fubje&t
lately agitated in congress ; oh my part
those sensations were inoreafed, from the re
flection that I was responsible to my coun
try and constituents f<* all my public
and to exercise my judgment for the public!
good, has ever been the of my ear
ncft wilh.âl o merit the continuance of
your c onfidence and regard, will be my
greatest reward ; and in every situation it is
my desire to avoid becoming the tool of par
ty, the promoter of faftion, or the friend of
anarchy. W. B. GROVE.

From tie Otfego Herald,
CAUTION.
WHEREAS a combination of men in this
county have undertaken to enrich thsm
felves.by fabricating titles tofundr/ valuable trads
of land, tbe property of gentlemen living in New
York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for *hich
traiU of la ltd large funis of money have been paid
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purchasers â 
It is thertLre just that public information should
Ue given, to the end, that the injured may seek re
dress while the nsen have property, and are to be
found. Those who have beÂ«n discovered are Tru
man Harrifon, Joseph Witcomb, saul now to re
side in the county of Saratoga ; Thomas Kelly and
several other! who go under fi&itioi.. names. It is
supposed that the lands offered ftr falaon those fa
bricated titles, are at least worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we have afiual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and 12, Otfega patent,
thrufand acres each,the afltial property of William
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
Mr. Chaumonr, now of Paris, and lames Avenll
and others, ot this State. There is some grounds
to sUppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, are under their
management.âThe Printers will do well to give
this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
public against purchasing thpfe lands, as also to de
prive those men in future from imposing on indivi
duafs, which their education and address have en
abled them to do heretofore. Witcomb has been
a ihopkeepÂ«r of some note in this country.
The following affidavits will set in a clear point
of view the wickrdnef# of those men, which when
the public have perused, will induce them to cx
cufc the interference of Wm. COOPER.
Otfego, July 28th, 1797.
I Thomas Kelly, of the County of Otfego, hav
ing been led irto an error, by John Witcomb ansl
Truman Harrifon, of the fame County, to sign a
deed to them, for Idt No. 58, Otfego patent, whioh
was the property of William T. Franklin now Mr.
Chamont's and others ; and further the said Joseph
and Truman did persuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made out on the icth day
of November, 179.3, or let back two years so as
to bring it to that time ; and fuhher the name of
Pardon Starks to that deed was a fi&itioift nam?,
there being no such person there. To this 1 make
yoluntary oath. THOMAS KELLY.

ing but the truth.
ELIHU PHIMNEY, Justice of the Peace.
On the 18th July, 1797, came before me Jacob
Kibby, a person by me well known and worthy of
good credit, who on his folcmn oath did fay, that
two of the parties abovetnentioned did make ap
plication to him this deponent, some tjnte in the
winter of 1796; to make them a deed for two thou
sand acrtt of land in the Otfgo patent, and pro
mised this deponent a (hare of the profits, on the
sale of said lands, for his so doing and thut they
made application several times for thd fame purpo'.e,
which fervicss this deponent as often refufed, de
claring to them that he had no right to lands, and
coulddo no such thing ; which daring attempt on
this deponent's integrity he had related a*nong his
friends fevfral times, previous to making this affi
