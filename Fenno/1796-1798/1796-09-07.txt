A very .valuable Merchant Mill,
A DISTILLERY and BREWERY, and sundry STONE 4
QUARRIES to be let'.
I will rent my merchant Mill .at the little Po- v
towmic, for any term not less thanfeven, nor more Than
eleven years, from the firft day of September next. The
mill-house is 42 by 40 feet,. three stories high, built with
Hone, and has in it three pairs of French Burr Stones, tv.v
ovcrlhot 18 feet water wheels, and Evans's macjiinery
> complete, with every other thing proper and ncccffary for
1 carrying on the bufincfs wrjth dilpateh, and at as little e^-
penfe as pofiible, all in good order.âFrom the mill to my
landing on the Fotomac river, (wherecraft, of any bur
then may deliver graip and take in flour) it is l about 40
yards, and from thence by water to George-Town and
1 the City of Walhingtus, about 3 miles, and to Aicxan-
dria about 11 miles. This fifuation, aided by a fufficient'
capital, will command the produce of a vefy cxtennve
back country, where large quantities of whuat and other 1
grain is annually made, the distance to it being from 8 u
to 10 miles less than to any maikct town up jn the l'lavi
jation of the Pdtonrmaf. Thite are on the â premises a
large done Coopers'/hj'p, a (lone granary, and '
dious miller's liohfe. At the landing afofd'aid a bridge
is now building over the Potomac, wliich is in great for- -
wÂ»rcViefs and probably will fee finifhed the erifuing fall. si
' T-hsre ate alfg.on the jyemifes, a Brewery and Dittille
fy, built witTi itone, .in them are three stills. two cogper; I
or boilers, with every necelTary article, ail new, and "in a
good order, and fufficiently luge to carry on the Bi ev
ery and Dillillery upon Â» very cxtehfive plan. This prop- f
erty I will rentier the'fame term of years. ,
Upon my lands adjoining the preniifes, and along the
banks of the l iver, where craft may lead with ease and dif
patcli, is an i illhelife quantity of building and founda
tion-(tones. Four quarries'are now open, and as many
more may be opened with ease : the done taken from these
quarries is better, and has the preference at this macket,
to any other stone brought to it. I will rent these quarries
separately or together as may bed suit. ,
On the top of the hill, and about 200 yards from the
milt, is s stone Dwelling-hoiife, large enough for the ac
commodation of a family.: also, a kitchen, dairy, smoke- I
house, &c. and a garden, enclosed and in cultivation, the <
foiof which is equal in goodness to any in this' (late. I i
will also rent this property. c
Adjoining to the Brewery and Diftillcry is a Smith's I
fliop, in which is a complete set of Blacksmith's tools, t
which 1 will also rent, and if agreeable I wilj hire to the
tenant two negro blacksmiths, one of them is a complete .
workman.
It I rent out the stone guarrics, I will fell three crafts,
which were built for the purpose of carrying stone t they
will altogether bring upwards of 90 perch. Immediate
pofTeffion will be given. For terms apply to the fybferib
er in this town.
The Mill, Brewery and Distillery, with their appurten
ances, will b*e deliver ad to the tenant or tenants in good '
repair, and muftbe so returned, at the expiration of the
lease orleafes. t .

GUILDHAXL, LONDON, May 21.
Before Lord Kenyan and a Special fury. J
" The KING V. JOHN REFVES, Esq. '
This was a prosecution by information, filed by
the attorney-general under the command of his z
majesty, who direfled it in compliance with the r
address of the house of commons, against Johfi *
Reeves, Esquire, for ptiblifhing a book, entitled j
I" Thoughts on the Engli(h*Gqvernment," address- v
ed to tha good.sense of the people of England, &c. v
which was alledged to contain libels on the two c
branches of the legislature, the lprds and commons, t
and among others the following : "in fine, the c
constitution of England is a monarchy ; the mo- Â£
narch is the ancient stock from which has sprung r
those goodly branches of the legislature, the lords '
and commons, that at the fame time give ornamant 1
to the tree, and afford fhtfltcr to those who fcek t
protection imder it. But these are flill only, t
branches, and derive their origin and sutriment '
from their common parent j they may be loppfcd f
off and the tree is a tree still, fliorn indeed of its t
honours, but not 1 thcnucaft_'fire.'' iX> -Â«
There was no difficulty about Mr. Jteeves being
the author, for that was admitted by Mr. Plomer, I
hisCounfel. The only qujft ion was, whether the (
author really intended to calumniate, traduce and 1
vilify the two houses of parliament, and 'to alienate 1
the esteem of the public for their funflions, by en
deavouring to cause it to be believed that the legal
power and kingly office could be exercised without* '
the two houses, and to dellioy the power of parlia
ment, by causing it. to be believed that the-royal
power could be carried on in all its functions as
well as it is, although lords and commons were a
bolilhed ?
It was contended on the part of the prosecution
that this publication had this tendency.
Oh the part of the defendant it was contended it 1
had not, and that thefc expressions on which the
charge was founded were merely metaphorical, and
had no reference whatever to the idea of bringing
the two branches of the legislature, the lords and
commons, into contempt. This question being 1
agitated at great length at the bar,
Lord Kenyon proceeded to deliver his charge to
the jury, in the course of which he observed, among 1
other' thing 6, that a great deal tiad been said about <
this fubjeft, so much indeed, that very little re- '
mained for Uim to address to them. Early in the
cause it was delivered from all necessity of proof; .
for the hrft step which the counsel for the defend- I
ant took, was that ef admitting the publication of 1
the took in qnefti&n by Mr. Reeves. â¢ The fubfe- 1
quent testimony, thefefore, he confeffed, appeared,
to him to be unnecessary. To a fuperficial observer ]
the contest of this day might appear very unequal. <
The present prosecution was instituted at the 1
command of his majesty in compliance with the ad- 1
drels of the house of cbmmons. The king had di- j
rested this prosecution against a private individual.
It was a beautiful feature in the constitution of this j
country, an instance of which was now exhibited I
in the persons of the jury, that a prosecution com- '
ing with such authority, (which under a bad I
government might overwhelm an individual) was I
to be submitted to them. In this country there ,1
could be no oppressive measures carried into effect, ;
if any such ever be attempted, for the jury ftept ]
in between the oppressors and the oppressed, and '
the accused was tried by men taken out of the fame 1
rank with himfelf to decide on his guilt or inno- '
cenee, and who, in considering all c&ies, had a lean- I
ing on the fide of mercy. This was a principle 1
which was adhered to in all cases, more especially 1
in those of a criminal nature, and that was one of 1
the principal â¢ advantages of the administration of ;
the criminal justice of thitcountry. ,
The attorney general, as had become him, enter
ed into a display of great learning on the Britilh 1
constitution. He went to the beltfourcesof infor
mation upon that fubjeft, and made extra&s that
did him honour in the recital, for they were chiefly
from authors who had written in the molt liberal
manner on our constitution. But he did not think
1 that he was giving much information to any of
those to whom he was addressing himfelf, for we
all kijew, at lealt every man who had received a
, liberal education knew, it was a knowledge which
we all carried about us, that the legislation of this
countsy consists of king, lords, and commons ; that
the executive power rests with the king alose, but
liable to be superintended, and corrcÂ£led too by
the two houses of parliament, becaufc the king or
dered nothing to be done but by the advice of his
ministers t and if they mifcondudted themselves
they were responsible to the two houses of parlia
| ment in this country. The ministers therefore, if
they mifcondufled themselves in the advice which
they gave to the sovereign, they were anfwerable'to,
and liable to be puniftied by parliament.
The power of free difcuffien was certainly the
right ef all the fabje&s of this country ; and in his
opinion we owed more to the free exercise of that
* right, than that of any other of the .rights of the
citizens of this country. He believed it would not
be faying too much, to fay we owed to the exercise
of the right of free discussion, the reformation, and,
1 afterwa.ds, the revolution of this country. It was
to this *aÂ« owing the success which attended the
labours of Lulher and others who opened the eyes
of the people, and led them to fliakc off aad re
- nounce the foperffitioti of tint Church of Rome, a
and released so considerable apart ot mankind from 1
its bondage. Free difcaffion had the fame good J
effcÂ£i in producing the revolution which followed
s that reformation. If therefore there fliou'd be f<?me
= little excrescences, fomc few blemiihes found to at-
â  tend a free difcufilon, it would be better to Wipe .
â¢ them away tenderly and gently, than to otnnguifh f
J them at once by checking a free discussion ; c
i therefore he thought that free liifcuffion ought not I
s to be pvefled upon too hardly.
sentiments were pretty well understood,
and (tad been Hated and allowed by the Attorney- v
â  General, not only in this cafe, but also on a for- v
' mer very celebrated one. He aUudcd to the cafe i.
> of the King and Stockdale, which was tried before f
: him in Well mincer-Hall. In that 6rofaution, al- 1_
though it came from the fame li'jfii authority as i^ie
present, the individual who was the objeÂ£l of it t
was not weighed down by the authority of the. t
prosecution.' He was defended with -reat Zealand si
eloquesce, and was pronouneed not guilty. *he a
jury did not think that they were bound to pro- o
nounce the publication a libel, but h flurried to them
, selves the right of judging for'themfelvts. Tliey a
3 asserted that light, and said that the defendant was i
â¢ not guilty. On that trial it was admitted that the t<
J whole of the book ought to be examined by the
| jury. They were advised to do what he should ad
vise the present jury to doâto take the book alonjj
with them out of Court, and consider the whole
> of it candidly, fairly and impartially, and out of g
the whole of it, extract what their judgment "
' rfught to be, as well on the passages out of which a
. delinquency was attempted to be as the p
r reft. They were bound to find the defendant guil- f<
3 ty, fi r absolve him, having regard to the particu- a
t lar palTages taken out and felefted on the part of o
c the piofecution ; but although they mull consider ti
f . these passages so abllrafteJ, yet they might, and p
t they ought, to go into the in older to b
1 give to the whole the qualification or description of 1
s the book, as well as that of the paffags obje&ed, P
, n A nn waa-ivrrptiKKi to the author. h
r With these ofcf*rvations, he should beg leave to v
â¢ state-to the jury, that which indeed the Attorney- f
e General had candidly Sated, -that in order to find- h
i the defendant guilty, they mud be fawisfied of the u
c evil intention of the defendant. The quo animo t
was the qfiellion to be tried. The.charge was, that u
,1 the defendant, intending to raise and dif '
t< contents among lifs rpajtftv's fubjeAs, and to alie- )
nate their affeflions, and to deflroy the eonili'.ution u
il and the government of this realm, by dellroying f
s the power of the two Houses of Parliament, and r
. to cause it be believed, that the regal power might c
as welt" be carried on in all its functions, although I
n Lords and Commons in Parliament should be abo- v
, liftied, as if they aflembled, did pablllh the book in '
t question. Or in other words, that the defendant t
e endeavored to impress upon the minds of the pub- 1
il lie, the idea that the legal power may, confident- 1
ly with the freedom of this realm, be carried on r
-j by the king, although the two House? of Parlia- i
j ment should never alfemble. That was the 'sub- a
fiance of the information. That wa6 the question, Â£
0 (which depended on the qui) animo J which the ju- c
ry had to try. They were to find whether their f
t confidences were Satisfied that this was. the motive c
- which influenced the defendant in puhlifhing this a
e book. This the attorney*general and the defend- c
; ant's counsel admitted to be the charge. His lord- i
. ship then said he had never read one word of this
f book. He confeffed it had been in 'his power to
. read it, but he abllained, because he thought he I
, should come to that court on the trial fitter for the
1 purpose with his mind a blank in any other
. condition. [Here the noble and learned judge then c
e read the principal paragraph on which the charge f
. was founded, and which we have copied in the be- Â»
. ginning of this our (hort account of the trial.] t
That was a paragraph of which the jury were to f
s judge, and ingoing so, they should judge of the mo- f
i tives with which the defendant publilhed it. That i
- was not to be his decision, for with the decision he \
J had nothing to do, but it was tu be the desyfion of i
s the jury ; but he would fay tbij, that if it were to \
e be his decision, if the verdict was to be his verdict, r
, and not that of the jury, he would examine the t
t pamphlet word by word, and take them together t
J with him out of that court. He should afterwards l
e decide with every fair leaning to mercy. With e- a
- very fair leaning* he said to mcrqy, npt to do away \
the criminal law, for it was eftential to the iuterefts i
e of this country to enforce the criminal as well,as the 1
y civil part of the law. But it was to be remembered
if that alllaw, and efpecial'.y the crimirfal law,was to be'
f administered in mercy 5 for the king himfelf, by his
coronotion oath, was bound to adminifler the law
in mercy. The cafe was now for the jury to de- â¢
h cide, and with them he would leave it.
The Jury retired and remained out of court an '
t hour. When they returned, the foreman said,
X "My lord, the jury are of opinion that the pam
il " phlet which has been proved to have been writ
k " ten by John Reeves, esq. is a very improper pub-1 '
if " lication. But being of opinion that his motives 1
e " were not such as laid in the information, find him" 1

About 6or 8 year? pad, in - the month of Au.
gust, Governor Marsh's barn, in Hartford, Vermont
was consumed by fire, with a large quantity of hay
and grain. Various were the conje&urea with rcfÂ«
pest to the cause of its taking fire. Many suppo
sed it done by some evil minded perfou some were
apprehenlive it was occasioned by the fermentation
ot the hay, which the governor hath pra&ifed put
ting into his barn, the day it was mown, and bat
partly k'ried. Others were of opinion that vegeta
ble fermented "heat could not become so intense.â
The Governor built another large barn, and has
pradtiied putting up his hay as ufoal ; it would
heat and smoke for some time, until the n.oitture
was evaporated, and then those appearances would
subside. The present year, the governor mowed
his hay early, when full in the sap ; and put up as
usual, about 40 tons in a large mow : it continued
to ferment longer thart usual, and the smoke was
unusually great, On the 22d Augult inft. two of
-the neighbours were pafiing tlie barn, and difcorer
jng~the smoke increased beyond what, had been
usual, went into the barn and ascended the mow ; the
smoke prefled violently from near the centre of the'
mow, where it had been hardefttrod when mowing ;
observing with attention, they discovered now and
then a faint slash of blaze rife and extinguish intha k
vapour. They immediately alarmed the neigh
bourhood, who collected a quantity of water ; they"
took the handle of a fork and ran it down .where
the centre of heat appeared ; it went down its
length after paffingthe hay on the top, without,
meeting reftflajice, and on pulling it out, the flame
followed * it. They immediately ftifled the Same,
and went to unmowing the hay, and by their vi
gilant exertions, and the application of'upwards of
one hundred buckets ofwaier, and unmowing the
hay, the bam and hay were saved, except near the
centre <>f the mow ; diameter", of
about fix or eight feet, uid lather larger perpendi
cular, wasreduced to perfect coal. ,lt is supposed
it had been burning a number of days.

THE NGRTIIEkN. AND SOUTHERN S?ATES 1
COMPARED.
' A well informed correspondent observes, that "it 1
is nts Isnger matter of surprise and alarm, at the giaxt
z Jlep! 'with which our wealthy North is advancing to
" the pinnacle of en-vied POPULATION, and our evapo- ;
rating south is drooping under her fupetitt policy."
c " When to the northward of Virginia," he observes, '
" a mechanic, a merchant or an artist comes to refidc '
1 amongst them, they eagerly seize the opportunity of I
c rendering him every assistance, use every means to in- 1
' duce his attachment to the placeJie has ehofen to re- J
fide in, and exult in having contributed to the increase j
e of the ftateâfinally, they discover all those good qua- !
lities, as a reward for A'hich, Providence seems to have
bellowed on them, this-vaft and insurmountable fu-
1 periority I"âContrasting the scene, he continuesâ
' " but when a mechanic, a merchant, an srtift, or what 1
1 not, shall come to reside southward of the Pcfcimac (
' (Ol Virginia I my native, still lov'd, and everrene- f
' rated state! why do you force me to develope what t
! otherwise than forced, should have'been sealed in lalting J
' olivionâbut it is necessaryâit is requisiteâyou are
' sleeping, callous to impending dangers, rosfe then and
view yoir erftirs I â100,000 fouls will support the alle
< gation)âhe is immediately enviedâall combine to
' render him difguftful in the eyes of the community ; c
1 one exclaims "he will injure our right worthy neigh
bour âanotherâ" tjieplace cannot afford
li'en a competency I"âa thirdâ" d n him, FU do ,
1 him all the mifchief I can I I"âAs a stranger they V
give him no chance of displaying his talents, btcaufe he ' l
feels himfelf oppressed among Free-Ma ! He fees him- n
felf loft in the bolotn of Liberty, and every man {hun
ning him as if he were a pestilence, for the crime of C
coming to sojourn among Jiem, to afiift in supporting d
the dignity and.independence of their state ! Can this
be denied ? No! bijt rt can be proven I What pity it
is then, but the lightning of jufl reproach could dart its
terror into the humid bosoms of such men, till fojeed
to acknowledge its impropriety and impolitic tendency,
they might at 'aft turn to consider in what confiftc the 11
true intertfts of these southern states, and what steps
are necessary to prevent tW rapid which the t
northern, and that state in particular, where (lands the
present emporium of America, are making over .them, p
One thjng is certain, that while the former persecutes
and tKe latter protects trade and manufactures, (he will
always command an alarming supremacy. ' -
