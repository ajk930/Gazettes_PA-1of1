THE Subfcrjber, proposing to contrast hii bnfi
nef#, offers this Ertate for sale, on moderate
terms. On it are one Blast and three Air Furnaces,
a complete Boreing Machine, and a very good grift
Mill, with two pair of stones ; also a good Farge, all
in perfeft repair, as are all the Water Works connect
ed with these various branches. The Air FurnaCes
were lately built for the purpose of casting Cannon
for this State.âThere are about two thousand acres
of Land, one half of which is under woodÂ» the other
very fine arable Land, producing the bell Hay and
Pafturc. The Cannon lately manufactured there,
fully proves the excellency of the metal, which is
superior to any in this country, and probably, equal
to any in the world ; for not one of sixty-nine guns
lately made, although some of the 24 were bored
into 3a pounders, have failed on proving. The situ
ation is very eligible, particularly for this branch of
manufa&ure, and a place of arms lying in the state
of ConneÂ£licut, and onlyigo miles from several land Â»
ings on the Hudson's river, and having every advan
tage that can rÂ«fult from a plenty of water issuing
from a large natural pond, very near the Furnace,
and which may be converted into a variety of other
ufeful purposes. The purchaser can be accommodat
ed with all the flpck. and utenii!sÂ» and have peffeflion
on or before the fir ft of June next, and preparation
may be made in the mean time for going into Blast im
mediately thereafter, for every pait wfll be delivered
in good order, with some coal, Ore, 6cc. See, For
terms, apply to Mr. Joseph Anthony, in Philadel

Whoever (hull be at the trouble of reading ;
Ibe documents which Mr. Monroe has an- ,
nexed to his pamphlet^-id eaufed to be pub- ]
lifhed by hi* confidential friend Bache, will ,
learn from them whether, the variousinftan- |
ces of tnifcoDduft which have been the sub- ,
jest of my observations are not fully sub- ,
ftantiated. Let them be repeated: ,j
ill. It appears to me he did mifreprefijnt ]
to the committee of Public Safety, that he . ,
was not authorized by the President tc cotn- |
plain of the decree of the French republic, .
* derogatory of our treaty with France, which j
Would naturally make an iraprefiion that the â¢
Executive eithtr neglefted the rights and j
interefls of the citizens of the United States i
or were afraid tp complain of the injuries aiyl [
spoliations done to tlieiV perfoni and proper- t
tan impreHioti no less dilhonorable to the {
Prefidtnt, than mischievous to our com- v
mrrcial fellow citteens. _ r
2d. It''appears to me h| did of his a
own bead inform the committee, if a e
departure from the treaty was found on ex- c
ptric :ce advantagioifs to France " bis gov- (.
troment and the people in general ot his
country, would bear with it not only with
pati-'uee but with pleasure," by which abe
jest and onauthorized declaration he has in Â£
some measure contributed to bring on our j
commerce, the ruinous system of depredati- a
on Under which its has been, and now is fuf
fering. _ h
3d. It appears to me he did misrepresent t
raiCfion of Mr. Jay when heafferted that c
it was limited exclufivclyi to two objefts,the p
delivery of the western posts, and coropenfa-
tion for injuries to our commerce, by which n
means he laid the foundation for certain, dif- ];
appointments and diffatisfaftion Â»n the pert e
of France, with whatever treaty might-be n
made between this country and GreatEEr- e
tain. m
hit duty, promise to communicate to the p
committee the treaty negotiated by Mr. Jay p
so fobn as it was in his power, and did em â
dtavour to obtain a copy for that purpose j,
before it could have been laid before the c
President of the United States, by fending e ,
a fpeeial messenger to London for it. b
sth. It appears to me he did encourage w
the projeft of a loan' of a considerable sum j
' of money to be advanced' on the credit of
the United States, to enable Franceto prof- f (
ecute the prtfent war, and relying on the t i
promise of France toreimburfe it if it should
beat a future day able; a measure incorn- t ;
patible with the continuance of our state of
iicntrality, which was the course that the â
Executive had determined, with the appro- a
batien'of America to pursue; a measure, c
that, by depriving the United States of their j
own resources when mod wanted, would Â£
have made them completely dependent on t
the fÂ»rtune and will of France. v
6th. It appeari to me he did negleft to a
use, seasonably and diligently, the means t
nut in his power by the President for ex- (
plaining his conduft relative to the British 1 (
treatv, and for difpglling the prejudices and ,
obviating the difconipt which, from the ; ,
extraordinary exertifllfis of the French fafti- ]
on in the United States, it was supposed, 1 j
might be excited in France. j ;
I have omitted, and (hall orait to mention
the other matters of inferior consequence, (
which, according to the documents, exhibit (
our minister in an unfavorable point of view .
as they tend to (hew h>s constant desire to
reccommend France to the affeftiohs of our
fellow citizens; and to excuse and palliate
those afts of injustice of which we have had
so much cause to complain, his zeal to make
himfelf agreeable to France, his indifference
to the feiuiments of the Executive, and his
undue preference of the interests of France
to all other objefts, with the blind and infat-
I uatedparty who take fide with France agjinft
America, these traits are deemsd meritori
ous: with such persons Mr. Monroe is wel
come to all the merit that his late ministry
can entitle him. It was becaufethat I con
fidtred him as one of them,_aÂ« he himfelf has
avowed, that I read his book, which eon
tain's that system of attack on our prtfent
government, deemed by the party, best cal
culated to introduce important changes.â
As it contains a great deal of his correfpo'n
dence upon matters unconnefted with a vin
dication of himfelf, or an accusation of his
employer, the late President of the United
States, I should not have persevered through
the tedious talk, but from a desire to be
truly informed, from the documents them
felvcf, and from an intention, if the narra
tive appeared unsupported by them, to offer
to the public my reflections on his conduft.
It was to be expefted that, this dismissed
officer, writing under the influence of re
sentment, would endeavour to exhibit in an
rodious view, the wife and virtuous statesman
who has juil retired from the helm; and I
dm fare no person wilt fay his narrative is
deficient of the malevolent spirit which has
charafterifed the publications of the party,
and efpecialJy, those that are printed by his
friend Bachc.
Let me explain what is meant l?y jaying
that this'book a part of the system of at
tack opon our present government, from
which the French party expeft to produce
important changes.
ft cannpt have efenped the observation of
the intelligent part of society, that they,
â who Were*pipofed toour prtfent government
at itt inllitution, have generally, after find'
ing theirefforts unavailing, which were made
to its firft operations, and after finding the
affeftionsof the people towards it, not on
ly attached, but encreafing, pretended to be
fatii-Scd with llie conllitution; they wave
changed their opposition, as theyfay, from
the <>overnmeht to the administration. It
13 alio weil known, that tbey here bsen in
viri.ibiy in concert witli the French cabioctj
ami that Mr. Genet \vas inflruffed to attempt
to produce fomA alterations in our go/era- 1
ment; and if, 0:1 his arrival th 6 circumitanâ¢ i
ces of the couitry werefmfavouraUlr to foch
attempts, that they might btf deferred to a
more convenient opportunity: I refer to Jug
inftrtiftions publithed by himfelf in 1 794>' !
It is -notorious,that whatever has been done
in France, by the ruling power of the day, 1
was approved and jufti/ied so fooh as it was
known by the French/action here; and that
whatever the French faftion has from time :
to time attempted or avowed here, hasbeei)
maintained by the ruing pow
er there. This harmony for so many years
has not proceeded from accident: It has
been the result of a combioaton between the
opppfition leaders here, who are defirÂ«us ta '
be in power, and the French cabinet, who i
are ambitious to regulate the affairs of Anne- ' J
rica, a3 well as of Europe. The bufine Â»' ;
is well understood on both fides, and this u
mon is founded on the ambition of both, i
Rather than not have the administration in 1
their hands, which might give an influence
to be used in creating radical changes in the '
constitution suited to their ideas; they are i
willing to obtain it by the aid of a foreign â¢
nation, and the latter is willing to bestow it? Â«
aid to mea who are expefted to be Fubf#rvi- t
ent if not devoted to its will. With thi? 1
objeft plainly before them, their Reps have t
been direfted thither without looking to the *
right or to the left. c
When the late Prefidcnt had demonftrat- Â£
fd, as every aft of his adminiitration did '
demonstrate, his invariable policy topreferve r
the United States in their independence ; 1
andthat he never would bethe toolof France <â 
'n tacking them to her, as a province in fa ft, s
however they might be io name; from that }
time it became a maxim in the French coun- I
:ils, that the confidence and affeftion of the Â»
people in George Wa/hington was to be <
leftroyed. It was forefeeti by this comb:- t
lation that, so long as the public Ihould be- '
ieve their confidence and affeftion well '
:d in him, his measures, and the persons <
noft aftive in maintaining them would be
:fteemed: Consequently, that his system 1
would be likely to be continued, and the I
idminiftration confined to men who had ap- <
proved, that system. That the weight of 1
President Washington's services might be di- '
ninifhed or taken away, calumny and falfe- '
lood have been at work day and 'nightâ >
:ertain gazettes in our country have teem- *
'd with every malevolent fiftion that could '
?e devised against him, and not cpntent <
yith taking editors of gazettes into pay, as <
[ believe is the cafe, there is also reafun to â 
relieve that the French republic have hired
everal writers to criminate, revile and libel i
he conduft of our late President, of whom <
Fom Paine and Fauchet deserve to be par- I
icularly noticed. I
Some of these writers have exprefled their â¢
Tiotive to be, to convince the people that, I
is a general he scarcely deserved well of his 1
country, and that as a statesman his admin
istration has been unwise, wicked, ungrate- i
fel and perfidious : That they have been
undeT unaccouatable prejudices in his favor, '
which mull be removed to fÂ»ve their liberties 'â¢
and that all who have sustained his adminis
tration, have like him, been traitors to our
country, Sc ought to be discarded from their
confidence.
This is the foira of attack now carrying
on in which Mr. Monroe by publilhing his
book is conceived to have taken a part, and
in which Tom Paine has already made his
appearance. Connefted with this fubjeft, '
I (hall draw; the attention of the public to
the letters hi Tom Paine, written at Paris
to President Wafhignton, while the writer
resided in the house of the American minis
ter.
CONGRESS.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Delate in Foreign Interourfe.
MONDAYâJANUAHY 22.
[Continued from yesterday's Gazette.]
Mr. Dennis (aid, notwithstanding the
extent which the difcufiion had already af
fumerl, he should offer no other apology for
offering forne fentlments to the committee,
than, that he thought the fubjeft capable
of being placed in other points of view,
than any in which it had yet been exhibit
ed. This question naturally divides itfelf
into two grand divisions, the firftas to the
competency of this house to interpose in'the
manner proposed, the fecpnd admitting its
competency, the expediency of the measure.
Th is firft division is again sub-divided, for I
he understood the gentleman to contend,not
only for the negative power to controul, by
a refufal to appropriate, but for the positive
creative power of fixing the grade and num
ber of ministers ; not merely the power of
regulating salaries, but the power of reftrift- I
ing the grade and pointing out the Gourts
at which they were to be employed. Gen
tlemen's arguments result in this, that, be
fore the President can in any instance pro
ceed to nominate a minister, a bill mult have
previously originated in this house and have
gone through all tke formalities of a legis
lative aft. That whenever the President
has proceeded, before this previous requi
site has obtained, he has violated the con
stitution. He did.not believe this eonftruc
tion warranted but cootradifted by every
aft of the government. He conceived the
idea founded in error and amongst all the
novelties which now pervade the world, he
did not conceive this the least extraordinary
âlf they believed this doftrine well found
ed, why did not gentleman at the last sessi
on, w! Ift their solicitudes were so much u
nited, left the executive should not befuf
ficiently disposed te accommodation with
the French republic, why did they not,
uhuft him on thefpecific propo
sitions which ought to be made with that
government ; direst him alf<Â» as to the num
ber of mioiftcrs to We employed ? Why, in
fliort, -,ave not those, whp have very gfave- n
'ly inferred &we Sre tworo to'Tupport the a
coollitution, Â»nd wh" ww oo*uder the exe- I
cutivc a; unauthorised to appoint, until it o
be declared hy the k-giflature that a minis- a
tor fhail'fce appointed. thole, who consider P
themfej.es as ceotinels orer the liberties of o
the people not only as to thofepoints, which v
lye wjttin their own sphere, butin whatever n
d'epartrcent they may be placedâwhy do t.
not the? now inllitute an impeachment for tl
those nimcrpus instances in which the Pre- p
fident has made these unauthorized appoint- h
ments,, and consequently tranfeendtd the n
boundaries, preftribed to bim by the con- I
ftitutior,? It wafiuppofed there existed the g
fame right in thfc-houfe tabulate the nilm- h
ber and grade of mmiftew, ps to regulate h
the number of jugjes ; but -it wag quite a t
different thing. Regulating the number of w
judge! w,'S a legiflative aft ; but the c
appointment of foreign roiuifters was as n
ftriftly eseautive. He believed in the foi-| ti
mation of a judicial system, it was necessary n
for the legislature to a'feertain the number of â  b
Judges necessary to be employed to admi- b
nifler that fyftemâfor they were so united a
aÂ«d dependent upon each other, that the v
joe could not be regulated withoutattending ti
[ to the otherâjudicial systems being objefts 'v
too, of municipal legislation, varied accord- g
ing to the ideas of different nations, and as- 0
certaining the number of judicial officers, si
was, in all nations, whose government is c
divided into departments, an objeft of le- v
foreign ministers are cxercifed in the ma- n
nagement of a system founded in the law of t>
nations and being independent of municipal t
authority,,is uniform throughout the world, s
and therefore the moment a tninifter is ap- v
pointed, the office over which he is to pre- "
fide is immediately created ; and for this h
reason in all nations miaiftcrial appointments c
are veiled in the; executive. If this were t
not so, and the house wei-e to aft upon the o
fubjeft, it would bt necessary fcr them to I
be possessed of all the information t
could be had on the'fubjeÂ£l. k
It was asked, if there were,no cafe in f
which the legislature could refufe an appro- [
priation when it was required by the Prefi- i
dent. It wasfufficient for him to fay, that t
the cafe before them cftuld not be of that t
description. He believed cases might exist, a
in which a refnfal' would be juftified ; but e
it would be one of those glaring cases which i
would at once appear. Such a cafe, as in I
the judiciary department, when juries de
determine damages to be so enormously high c
or low, as to induce the judges to intercede c.
for a new trial. " I
Mr. D. took notice of what had fallen- e
from Mr. Gallatin, as to the poflible abuse a
of this power of the executive, and replied f
to it ; and a Hedged that the reasonings in f
support of jhe amendment went more to an J
annihilation of the diplomatic corps, than i
to a reduftion of it. For if all foreign mi- 1
nifters were both useless and dangerous, as 2
it regarded economy, it was best entirely to t
abolish the establishment and instead of fa- i
ving a few thousand dollars, to save the i
whole expence, which forms a veryhandlome I
item in our public -faring. If all lriluiftcis j
were dangerous, as alledged by that gentle- ]
man, because, they will inveigle us into the /
political fyftejns of Europe ; why do tbay ' 1
propose to-continue them at the courts of <
London and of France. Thef; are the na
tions mod interested to make impreffiotis up- 1
on our agents, and these are the nations, 1
where political party, (in which our minis
ters are said to be always liable to be invol
ved) is certainly carried to the greatest ex
tent. He considered all "these arguments
and many others as being rather applicable
to an entire subversion of the diplomatic
establishment, a fubjeft not under consider
ation, than to the partial deduftion which
was the objeft of the amendment, and by
uniting whatever could be said in favor of
each, their arguments had a meretricious
influence -calculated to seduce.
It has been said too, it was untieceffary
to have a minister at Berlin, and he ought
to be recalled because we had no commer
cial concerns with that power. This then -
amounts to an affirmative assertion, that
where we have commerce, there we ought
to have political agents- But we nre by
the fame gentlemen told, that commerce
needsoe political proteftion. He believed
this might be tme, in times of general tran
quility, but at this moment of general in
ftab.ijity, at this period of national caprice,
when the political regulations of nations
had been changed two or three times in a
year, in a manner the mod injurious to our
commerce, was it of no consequence to
have political agents to obviate evils of this
fort, before they came to maturity. Our
late minister to whose assertions
gentlemen to give the highest
credit, has informed us, that on his arrival
there, the work of alienation was at a dan
gerous height, and that by his exertions,
reciprocal harmony was for a time restored,
and the gentleman from New-York (Mr.
Livingfton) has told us what important ser
vices he had rendered us, and had he. have
â  continued there, the probability was, our
fhendfhip would have continuedâlt will
be recollected, that whilst he was thus re
- futing the arguments of those he meant to
support, it was his objeft to shew, what
ourUt to be the liberality of the executive
â¢ in l of their appointments ;
and he forgot that whilst he was arguing a
r gainst. the employment of ministers, he was
: proving them very necessary thinge, provi
: ded they could be felefted according to his
â¢ choice. But I need not be particular to
f cite these instances of contradiftion, forfo
numerous are they, that I will put the e
â  vent of the morion upon the following issue,
- that it fhall-fuccced when they agree in their
- arguments. He also touched upon the dif
i tinftions which had been made betwixt po
, litical and commercial agents, and supposed
consuls infufiicient to ahftver all the neceffa
t ry purposes of commerce.
The gentleman from -Virginia had urged
n 1 the propriety of the adoption ot this amend
ment, from the fear of the exceptive branch b?
of the govipiment fwallovying up the reft. of
If he believed any danger from, the-sbufe P r
of this government, he should expeft it to ev
arise from this house, and not from the
President. He should be warranted in this ao
opinion from what had been seen in this go- tic
vernment, and by the experience of other wl
nations. His inFerencs from fafts and his- in
tory were different from those drawn byo- hj
ther gentlemen. Since governments df de-' jt
partments have_bcen instituted, Evolutions tl ,
have most frequently happened thraujb the ot
medium of the democratic branch. The co
. Eoglifh government, for iirftance, had ori- a |
ginated in a monarchy and aristocracy. It Wl
had at full no detnmrracy in it. lt~ was,
however, by degrees introduced ; and in ur
their revolution, monarchy and aristocracy I it,
were annihilated, and the government be-1 th
came a government of 558 despots. The I* ll
next important era in the-hiftory of that na- j
tion was about the termination of the A-
merican war. At that time the monarchy p,
became unpopular ; the democratic branch â  th
became noifyand clamorous, and wished to th
annihilate the gfcvernment.âTheir power j*'
was so great, that the king was obliged to !
turn out hi? ministers, and an appropriation I '
'was refufed for the ordinary expences of
government. To such a height was the m
opposition carried, that there were four dif- di
ferent adminiftrations'in two years. It be- tr
came necessary for the crown to be subser
vient to the views of the house of commons,
Mr. Fox and his adherents were ad- â¢
mitted into effice ;/yet they were disconten
ted, and the king was obliged to dissolve tl
the Parliament. Before the new eleftion, ti
she ? fpirit of the nation, however, so fa
vored the monarch, that sixty of the most Jf'
violent members were thrown out of the 2
house, and to this violent disposition of the n
commons was it chiefly to be attributed, v
that the crown now enjoys so much power tc
over the other branches of government. ""
He did pot know but bribery and corrup- el
tion had fometbing to do in the business ; u
but he mentioned these circumstances to 0
shew, that the change which had taken tj
place in that country had been chiefly ow- d
ing to an imprudent democratic spirit- He '*
thought it ought to operate as a warning
to this house, never to assume powers un
authorised by the conflitution : as every '
encroachment of this kind, when it was
unfuccefsful, never failed to ftrsngthen that a
power which it meant to crush. o
If, said Mr. D. the executive of this
country possesses more influence than he 5
ought, it does not arise from patronage,
but from the spirit of finding fault with ex- t
ecutive measures so. frequent in this house, ,
and from the turbulent spirit which had, t
from time to time, been shewn. The rati
fication of the British treaty occasioned a '
partial disapprobation of executive measures |
as any movement which government could (
have made at that time, would have doue, f
as what would have been pleasing to one set c
of men would have been displeasing to a- r
nother. But, he believed", that this house I
refufing afterwards to appropriate money
to carry it into effeft, produced greater un- '
pojiHTaiTty towards it, than had before been '
produced towards the executive, as it ex
,cited an alarm that the house of reprefenta- >
â  tivet was about to swallow up the powers !
of the other departments of government, j
An eleftion having since taken place, thig '
circumstance, it was probable, had produ
ced a majority in both houses generally in ]
favor of executive measures. ,
Mr. D. concluded, by faying, he did not
agree with the gentleman from Virginia, '
that republican governments were more fob
, jest to patronage and corruption than any I
other. Mr. D. took a view of the patron
age of the British government, and spoke
of the permanent nature of their execu- -
tive. And he believed gentlemen had bor
rowed their ideas of this branch controling
the Mcecntive, from governments which
have a hereditary executive, or aristocracy,
and where if the government once got
wrong from a preponderance in the execu
tive (the people having no controul over
their appointment) there was no other way
of bringing them back, but by an effort in
the democratic branch. But in our gov
ernment the people, instead of giving this
pontronl to the house of representatives,
have reserved it to themselves ; and whilst
the afts of our government, he said, were
perpetually before the people, the periodi
cal reverlion of power into their hands, en
' abled ':hem to mould the government to
their will ; and though some particular
branch of it might be unpopular for a time,
1 it could not long remain so, and he knew
no mode of corrupting the government,
whilst the people remained incorrupt. He
was of a very different opinion from the
â  gentleman from Virginia, in refpeft t.T the
present fituatitfi of the government of this
country. His idea was that the people of
â¢ the United States had come to an enlight
> ened unt'erftanding of their duty ; but, if
â  there should be any danger of shaking the
government, he believed it would arise from
5 this house, and from no other department.
1 Btft he believed the dangers which were
now conjured up were rather the dreams of
a disordered imagination, or the crudities I
0 of indigested political opinions, than pro
-1 duced by any real cause : he hoped, there
e forrr the motion Would not be agreed to,
NV- Brint did not intfnd to have taken a
s ny part of the debate on this fubjeA ; but he had
1- j been induced to rife, from the manner in which
s every one who favoretj this amendment had
0 been spoken of ; from whuh, and the anathe
-0 mas which had been pronounced againfi them,
he thought it behoved every member in favor
of the amendment, to come forward and express
'Â» > his cpipion.
ir | The ohjeilions urgeil against the amendment,
f- , he believed, might aimed be confined to two,
>- ( viz. the incompetency of the houfÂ« to mike the
(J regulation, ind the inexpediency of the n.eafure.
j With rtlpefl to t!.e firtl, he acknowledged l e
| did b: li-ve it vouid have been itnpofiible for

Thedoflrinesofchecksandbalaneeswhichhad V
been laid down by the gentleman from Penn
iylvama, had heen called novel, calculated to
Jlop toe wheels of gavemment. Another gentle
man had told the committee that those who ad
vocate this doarine, meant nothing less than the
total overthrow and deitruaion of the Sovern
mcnt. He "believed it migotywifn great propri
ety, be retorted upon this gentleman, that those
wha treat this doarine as novel, are the gentle
men who to the overturning and deftruaion
of the government. For himfelf, he confidred
tins doarine as a vilaiprinciple ; not as intro
duced by the gentleman from retvnfylvsrnia,
hut as a thing which may be found in every
feature of the coÃltitution. Bsi it was a mem
orable circumflanee illustrated in the speech of
the gentleman l from Conncaicut that when
gentlemen endeavoured to prove an unfounded
doarine, one part of their arguments fruftrated
another. This rcmaik applied to the doarints
of checks and balances ; for, though they deny
the doarine, yet they fay there is no ratioml
ipprehenfien of danger from the power of the
president confined as it is by the appropriations
ef this house. Thus, whiift they are rejeaing
the doarine of checks, and spurning at those
*ho support it, when it futts thtir argument,
they themselves acknowledge it>
It was true, when the power of the President
was considered on a rational ground of con
ftruaion, there was no serious cause of alarm ;
but when they found novel conttitutional doc
trines introduced by those Who consider them
selves as patrons of exeeutive influence; and
doarines, which formerly universally obtainedâ
now exploded, there was fcrious ground of ap
prehension.
It was a(ked whether if it was proper at all,
to reduce our /oreipn min'fters whether it wm
proper at this time, considering the slate of this
country and of Europe ? This remark v( this is
not the proper time, was conflantly suggested
whenever a reform was proposed in any country,
and dreadful phantoms were as conftintly con
jured up to maintain inHitutions, which could
not be otherwise supported. Why was the pre
sent moment more inaufpiciousthan any other?
Admitting the tumultuous situation of Europe tÂ»
be as described, was there any danger from with
drawing our ministers from Portugal and Pruflia.
Or, if wewereinhoÃility with them,whit ass. 6fc
could it have on the United States ? Both were
' destitute of aay means of injuring sach other, as
" much ft) as two men would he who â¦ere bound
hand and foot. Mir,ifters were proposed to l.e
retained at London and Paris, and if it would
. accommodate gentlemen, he would have no eb
jeaion to agree to a minister plenipotentiary at
Spain,though he saw no occasion for it He
\ was 110 friend to diplomatic tharaaers abroad.
> He believed foreign miniftershad been tht carfe
1 of modern nations for many years.
, A fulijea of a veiy delicate nature had been
t involved in this. It had been remarked by hit y
â¢colleague, and had been acknowledged with
.fijns cf exultation from another quarter, that
there existed a difpofhion in the executive to
' chufe to ofliee men of a particular political 0] .in
-1 ionânone hilt those devoted to the admimltra
-* tioÂ»,~Siid ready to jofGry cve/y meifure it has
s ever taken. Inileod of denying this eharge,
gentlemen rejoice in the truth of it, and declare
it has never been departed trom, but the govern
ment has had caufs to regret the departure. The
e gentlemaa from Conneaicut went further.â
" Would not the president, said he, be guilty of
- inconfiflency, to admit any gentleman into the .
o government, who had been opposed to the mea
r lures of the executive ? " What 1 (exclaimed
he) admit men who were diforganizers âmen
' whose opinions are calculated to produce eonfu-
V lion and to overthrow the governtrent !" And
'' would that gentleman seriously and solemnly,

Tfle committee hadbeen told, that tlieexecu- j
tive iizd never flepirted from this line of con
divjÂ£l,bnt he hÂ»d l>ad serious eaofe to lament it. 1
The al!af:on was well understood. Our
had called an eminent charaÂ£ler abroad. I; the
executive of the United States had had ferims

racier ; ihst it should be farmed of such mate- 1

now enjoyed, and so far from regretting his
. having been in office, hi felicitated the country
in having had such a character employed at the
important moment in which he Unit
ed States.
The gentleman fromConne&icut had proceeded
to fay that tiÂ« man who did not approve of the
meafurc-s of the executive could conscientiously
accept of any office under government. He df
fered in this, as he did in mod other things
with that gentleman.' He thnught the inflan
ce he had adduced was an exctptiOn ; and he
would produce others. Might not a minhon
eftlv accept of a military office ; a colleger of
duties, or alrooft any other office under gnv'frn- !
ment, though his political opinions differed from
that of the executive.
His colleague had been very-feverHy animnd

governments as tending towards an adhesion of
parts, and by that means towards corruption
He had imagined fiom bis acquaiittar.ee \yiih
that gentleman, that he would never have been
charged witu a want.of attachment to a repub
lican government, and a fair conftimflion of
what be advanced would go to o

ment in purity, and nething more.
Mr. B. concluded his obfervarions by a re
mark upon -what *fell from the gentle

He thought him entitled to all the celebrity of a

as the cause of the great power of the King of
England, that he had so very extenfi-ve an ap

There never war. l inu^le' of such dastardly a
bandonment of duty ; Uich a degradation of cha-
an#' national honor, as Mr. Monroe has ex
hibited agiinft himfelf, in his lecter to*the French
commiflary of foreign affairs, dated Sept. 1,1795.
See p. 227, 2*28.
It Items that this minister had it in charge to
procure tho aid of the French in bringing about
a treaty with Algiers. But net eonttnt with alking
their aid, in the ajual manly stile, he took pains
to give France all the merit of effefling a treaty
and of keeping the United States out of view, for
the cxprefspur pose, that the " mediationof France
need not be loft."' The folfewiug is an extras
from the humble prayer and petition of James Monroe
to the French government.

Â« c oith Front Street#
From the Avxosa of tbis Morning.
Mr. Bache
In your paper of yesterday you publilhtd
a piece with the fignatnre of South Front
Street, in which I am by name charged
with a fhameful breach of the
laws," a meanness in the aft as despi
cable, as a breach of the law 3 would be
criminal. I am charged with receiving
from a Scotch of this city five
dollars for a passport which should have been
deliveredand with a beggarly address
to the rfierchant's "generosity" to obtain
the money. The following affidavit of
Thomas Wotherfpeon, the merchant allud
ed to, proves that as it refpefts me, the
charge is utterly falfc and as malicious as it
is -fdlfe.
(Signed)
TIMOTHY PICKERING.
Department of State, Philadelphia,
January 25, 1798.
City of Philadelphia, fs.
I Thomas Wotherfpoon, of the Gity of
Philadelphia, merchant, being duly sworn,
depose and fay, That Doftor Reynolds,
who was a fellow lodger with me at Mrs.
Wilson's in South Front Street, some time
laftfummer, speaking of citi?en<l)ip, aflced
me whether I bad obtained a certificate of
mine ; and on my answering in the affirm
ative, he made several further enquiries a
bout the expence of procuring a certificate
and paflport, which I freely communicated
to him, to wit : that I had paid Mr. Burd,
Clerk of the Supreme Court of PentifyWa
nia, two dollars; Clement Biddle, Esq.
for drawing theneceflary forms, two dollars,
Mr. Levy, Gounfellor at law, fivs dollars ;
and forthepafljportat the Secretary ofState's
office, five dollars; that some time last week,
I believe on Friday last, Doftor Reynolds
renewing the fubjedt of my paflport, I told
him that I did 'not know Mr. Pickering,
but I described the person who gave me the
paflpon to be a big, stout man ; that on
the next day, I believe, but certainly not
more than two days thereafter, Dodtor Rev
noldsraentioned tome,thatWm. Todd,Efq.
and himfelf had been speaking about my
being a citizen of the United States, and
that they had some , doubts of my certifi
cate and paflpprt being legal, and Doftor
Reynolds requested a fight of them in or
der to fatisfy Mr. Todd, that in conse
quence I shewed my certificate of naturali
zation, and my paflport to DoÂ£tor Rey
nolds, who perused only the latter, and im
mediately returned it to me, faying he
could fvvear to its being the hand-writing
of Timothy Pickering: that in refpeft to
my application to the secretary of state's
cilice for a paflport, the following are the
faits l -J^uiJ apply on the afternoon preced
ing the date t>f tTtcâpjeiJggj-t a and as the of
fice was then /hut for that day, T was told
by a woman to call the next day at cine
o'clock, when I should find the secretary
state at the office : I accordingly called on
the morning of the 12thofNovember, 1796,
and was shown up flairs&introdncedtoagen r
tleman who was alone;'fromhim I a(ked for
a paflport, at the fame time exhibiting the
certificate of my naturalization from the
clerk of the fupremc court of Pennsylvania :
the paflport was made out for me and deli
vered : I alked the person wliq made it
out what was to pay ? He answered,
"they never make any charge ; it was at
the pleasure of the person receiving the
paflport or words to that effeft : I then
handed him five dollars : he said it was too
much : I answered "by no means he
replied, he was much obliged to me ; and
then I went away: that this morning a
person called upon me about a publication
in Bache's Aurora of this day, and the
paflport therein referred to": I immediately
recognized him to be the fame person who
had given me the paflport, and to whom I
paid the five dollrrs : this person is a lusty
man, and I am since informed is named
Jacob Blackwell, a clerk in the office of
Secretary of State : and lastly, tjiat it was
utterly without my privity or aflent, that
the aforefaid publication was made in Bache's
gazette.
