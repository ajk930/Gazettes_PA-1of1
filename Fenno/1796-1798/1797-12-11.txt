File House of Reprefeiuativgts of this
State, met at eleven o'clock on Saturday,
agreeably to adjournment, and after receiv
ing and reading two or three private peti
tions, procetded, according to the order of
the dav. to the appointment of the. pointers
oi their journals, when there again appeared
to be an equal number of votes for Meiirs.
Hall and Sellers and F. and R. Bailey, a id
of course 110 dfcilion took place. The
que (lion was, therefore on motion, poftpon
ed till Tuesday. The hour of twelve hav
ing arrived, a meflage was received from
the Senate, informing the house, .that the
Senate were afTembled and ready to receive
the promised communications of the Gover
nor of the Commonwealth. The House, in
consequence, adjourned for half an hour,
arid fjf oceeded to the Senate Chamber, and
a few minutes after they were f<tated. the
Governor entered, accompanied by the Se
cretary, and delivered the following Ad
dress:
Gtntlem;n of th; Senate, and
Gentlemen of the House of Repr fentatives,
. The alarm wTiich occasioned an abrupt
adjournment of' the Legislature, has been
.ju'.tified by the catadrophe that
ensued ; but I rejoitT that so early an op
portunity occurs to congregate you upon
the perfeCt restoration of health to our me
tropolis. While, therefore, we indulge the
feelings of sympathy aqd sorrow for the un
fortunate viftiras of the calamity, we are
called opon devoutly to acknowledge the
beneficence of Provjdenee, and to pay a tri
bute of gratitude to the meritorious citi
zens, who have been the inflruments of that
beneficence, in mitigating the severity, and
accflerating the termination of the late con
tagious sickness.
Fyim the various documents that will be
prefentqd for your information on thin fub
jWt, you will collect the particulars of the
progress antj extent of mortality. It is
rcprtfented, in that during the
months of August, September and October,
there died, within the city and its fnburbs,
1250 persons ; that, of those persons, 1000
fell by the prevailing fever ; and that the
number of persons who escaped, after being
affeCted by the contagion, may reasonably '
be computed at 4000. Corfcpared with, the
mortality of the year 1793, when Philadel
phia fuift-red under a similar visitation, this
ftatcmetrt is enough to evince the beneficial
effects that have been produced by the ear
ly evacuation of the city; by the alylum
which the tentsr CreCted 011 the Commons,
afforded to an indigent class of fugitives}
and by the previous inftftution of a public
hospital on the eadtrn banks-os the Schuyl
kill. Of the aCtivity and fidelity, likewise,
vrith which the business of the board of
health, was transaCted ; of the judgment and
philantbrophy with which the legislative
grant was expended ; and of the liberality
with which individuals contributed, by per
sonal as well as pecuniary aids, to alleviate 1
the public distress ; the testimonials are ob
vious to every eve, and mull be grateful to
every heart. The incidental cxpenfes of
the health-office are edimated at rg,coo dol
lars, and the gratuitous cpntributioiu (in
cluding the legislative grant) amount, it is
believed, to 33,000 'dollars. With these
resources alone, therefore, and surrounded
by objeCfs of desolation and dismay, during
a term exceeding two months, the sick of
this populons city have been humanely che
rifbed âthe deccafed have been decently in
terred âthe aged and infirm have been com
fortably fuftainqdâand, in'the genuine spi
rit of benevolence, the indudrious have been
employed and rewarded. To a recapitula
tion so consolatory let mc add, as a just eu
logium on the moral state of the communi
ty, that amidst all the temptations and op
portunities to plunder and riot, which the
erifis might naturally be supposed to create,
the rights of property were never more rÂ«f
peCted, nor public order more rigidly main
tained.
Thus emerging from a scene of compli
cated calamity, it becomes our indifpenfa-
Me duty to contemplate the oaufe, and (as
far as 'human precaution can avail) to coun
teract and repel its future opeiations. It is,
indeed, to be seriously lamented ftiat a di
versity of opinion, in relation to the origin
and nature of the disease, Ihould have rais
ed an acrimonious spirit of controversy, dif
graceful to science and injurious to society :
but it is a fufficient fatisfaction to know,
that a difference in the modes of cure can
have no influence on the question of pre
vention ; and, fortunately, in that refpeft,
whether the disease has been imported from
foreign countries, or was generated hei'e, the
several remedies proposed are not only per
fectly confident with each other, but will al
ways be mod efficacious when employed to
gether. Permit me then, gentlemen, with
a solicitude suited to the importance of the
occasion, to recommend to your immediate
attention, the plans which are detailed by
the college of physicians, by other learned
Members of the faculty, and by the inspec
tors of the heahh-offiece, in the reports that
Will be submitted to your consideration.
By these reports, it will be found, that
in order to guard against the introduction of
pestilential and contagiiius dife-afes, from fo
reign countries, the establishment of a board
of health, re drifted in point of number, so
as to epfure responsibility ; in
part, of medical characters, and excluding,
entirely, persons whose interests are liable
be immediately by the laws of qua
rantine âii efl'entially requilite. The pub
lic buildings Â«a State Island should be en
larged, so that separate accommodations
may be appropriated for the healthy and the
diseased, as well as places for fumigating,
and magazines for floring the targets of ves
sels ; and a permanent public hospital Ihould
b: erected on the neighbpuriug commons,
for the -reception of ar\y inhabitants as the
city,infected, or supposed to-be infeCted,
with a contagious fijknefs. From the be
ginning of July to the end of OCtober, # in
every year, all vefTela arriving from the Me
diterranean, the eoaft of Africa, the Weil-
Indies, and the continent of America to the
southward of Florida, should be compelled
to perform a fixed and. effectual quarantine.
Tlte powers of officers employed in this
department of our police should be equal to
all ts objects, and to every poffiblcemergen
cy ; and the punishment to be inflicted Upon
thole who (hall transgress the law, should be
of the mod exemplary nature. 1
For obviating all danger to the public
any domellfc foarcc Â«f conta- ;
gion, an attention to the cleanliness of the j
city, its avenues, and vacant lots, seems to
bs tlÂ»c only neceflary care. The powers of
the respeCtive corporate bodies, which are
condituted for the local purposes of the ci
ty, the northern liberties, and thedfdriCt of
Southwark, should, therefore, be rendered
completely competent to cft&blifh and en
force the various regulations, which this ob
jeft will fugged. But the interposition of
the legislature will, also, be indifpeufable,"
is order to insure such a supply 01 water,
through the medium of canals, as appears
to have become essential to thej general con
venience, as well as to the health of the com
munity.
In delineating this outline of the measures
that are proper to be pursued, I am sensible
gentlemen, that I have openedHo your view
a wide field of labor and expeuce. But,
when you refleCt, that probably, for want
of such precautions, the business of the city
has twice, within a period of four years,
been deranged ; its population difperitfd ;
and its prosperity endangered ; you will
perceive, that, independent of every senti
ment of compaflion, and upon a mere calcu
lation of interest, the whole commonwealth
is deeply concerned, that every effort of
wisdom and finance should be made, to pro
teCt the feat of our government and com
merce from the return of so dreadful an e
vil.
It is with peculiar pleiifure, under thecon
fideration which has been jud fuggeded,
that I advert to the progress of improve
ment and opulence in every part of Penn
sylvania. The effeCts of a liberal and judi
cious policy, adtuating and guiding the le
gislature in the disposition of the public
wealth, are defcernible in the greater facili
ty, With which the interior intercourse, by
roads and rivers,, is maintained ; in the aug
mentation of the number of inhabitants j
and in the flourifhing condition of the vari
ous sentiments that have been recently form
ed. The auspicious result, therefore, of our
experience, at once, enables the date to de
fray the ex pence, and invites its legislature
to promote the acComplishment ot every ob
ject of public utility. Befidei those objeCts
to which I have ijow referred, the inllitu
tion of public fclrWils, the reformation of
the laws for regukmng elections, the orga
nization the militia, the encouragement
of inland navigation, and the improvement
of roads and highways, merit particular .at
tention j and will afford an ample scope for
the display of patriotism and public spirit.
The report of the agent of information
(which I have diredted to be communicated
to you) fatisfaCtorily exhibits the progress
in executing the several contraCts that have
been formed for improving our roads and ri
vers : but it is ajuftice peculiarly due to
the contractors, for opening a canal at the
falls of Conewago, in the river Sufquehan
nah, publicly to announce the completion
of that important undertaking ; and to ac
knowledge, from aCtaal Â©bfervation,that the
work appears tobÂ« an honor to the state, as
well as a lading monument of their enter
prize, skill and integrity. The disburse
ments ofthr contractors have fo.far, indeed,
exceeded the sum appropriated by law, that
-on a principle of equity, as well as to ex
cite an advantageous emulation, I am indu
ced to recommend such a modification of
their contraCt, as will allow the exaCtion of
'a toll from paflengers, equal tothe charge of
hiring Aerfons to attend the locks, and to
keep tftm in condant repair.
For many other topics inter,efting to our
condituents and claiming a legislative inter
position, permit me, gentlemefy to refer, te
the communications, which have been made
on former occasions to the general afltmbly.
In the judiciary department yru will find,
that the want of the powers of a court of
equity, has been deemed a radical defeCt in
our fydem of jurisprudence : and the sala
ries allowed to the associate judges of the
court of common pleas ofPhiladclphia coun
ty (where business of great moment and dif
ficulty condantly occurs) is tnanifeftly in
confifterrt, as well with the official indepen
dence contemplated by the conditution, as
with the reasonable compensation, to which
every citizen is entitled for the services that
he renders to the public. The theory of
our penal code (justly the pride of Pennsyl
vania) seems hitherto to be free from any
rational objection. The fuperintendance
and discipline of the criminal prisons and
penitentiary houses, are, likewise, highly
meritorious ; and completely efficient. But
it is incumbent upon me to declare-, that
the debtor's apartment presents a contrad
of wretchedness and disorder, which is pain
ful to every sense of humanity, and dedrue
tive to every principle of virtue. Let me
earnedly therefore, gentlemen, entreat, that
an immediate remedy may be applied to this
encroafing grievance. The expediency of
abolishing imprifanment for debt hrta repeat
edly btcn under the consideration of
giflature ; but whatever may be the issue of
your deliberations on that point, the rcgu
' lation of bankruptcy, and a revision of the
laws rtlating to insolvent debtors, are fub
jetls which the present state of commerce
and credit will not fuffer to escape your at
tention. It will be neccffary, likewise, to
include in any arrangement, that shall be
made on this branch of our police) lome
j provision for the cafe of debtors, who, after
being ytcjfted by civil procels, may he c</m- '
mitted for offences, to the cri-rl.ial jail j so ,<
that those who have the cuilo.Jy of their i
pÂ£rfon6, may beheld refposfible, with fuffi- :
cient fnreties, as well to the creditors, as to
thÂ« public.
Frtjm the inWiWftmg fubjecls which ap
pear upon yonr records, none will be thought
more deferring of fcleftion, than the (late
of the territorial controvcrfy in Luzerne,
and tli..' neighbouring counties. With re
fjieft v o the controversy itfe'f, nothing has
occurred to change the opinion that wis de
livered in a former Address ; but, consider
ing the extensive f;de of public land, tha
rapid advancement of lettjements, and the
menacing collision of legal rights and equi
table claims, in other quarters of the State,
it becomes daily more important to the se
curity of private property, to the pre
fervatioli of public tranquility, that your j
deciiron, in the pnifent cafe, Thould evince i
the disposition and the poiver to assert the
juriUiftiort, and maintain the rights of our !
go\â¬rnment.
There will be prefenUd, Gentlemen, for
youF information, a copy of the Contrast
which has been made for importing 10,000 1
Hands of arms ; and, as soon as the arranga- '
ment can be completed, you will, also, re
ceive a copy of the Contrail for manufaftur
ing a like number, agreeably trt the direfti
ons Of the aft of Assembly. The report of
the Commiffionfrs for erefting the public
building on Ninth-street, will shew the pre- '1
sent situation of that work, the manner of
diiburfing the money appropriated for ac- *
couiplilhing it, and the balance that remains
iiNfatisfied. Yo'u will, of course, prescribe,
during the courte of the fefiioii, some use
for the building ; since it cannot now be j
employed according to the original design. j
In examining the account Qf our Financ- 1
es, yon will find, Gentlemen, that from !
the lit of January (when there was a bal- j
ance iti the Treafuryof 94,718 Dollars and,
85 Cents) to the 30th of November lall,
the receipts have amounted to a fuin
of 187,951 ipolltri and 27 Cents ; and that
the diTburleteents during the fame period,
have Sftftoarited so the sum of 210,914 Dol
lars aitd 60 Cents. The specie, therefore,
at this time in' the Treasury, amounts to
the sum of 71,755 Dollars and 12 Cents :
But it iÂ« proper to remark, that, in the
eotirfe of the ensuing month, besides the
fu[<plies constantly flowing from the operati
ons of the Land-Office, the fees of Public
Offices, and other sources of contribution,
there will be a further accumulation of about
80,000 Dollars, from the Dividend on the
Shares rif the Dank of Pennsylvania, and a
bout 2,900 Dollars from the principal and
interest of the Stock of the United States,
the property of the State. You will, also,
observe, that many of the items of expendi
ture are of a temporary naturt; while many
of the inflruments of revenue become daily
more produftive; and our annual income
will receive an addition of about 13.600
Dollars, as soon as the period for paying
interest on the Deferred Stock (hall arrive.

This view oEour Finance* mud be peculi
arly -pknfrng to you, on whom,the duty Â»f
providing for the public expenditure, is, in
the firft instance, devolved by the Constitu
tion. Though the existing appropriations
are great ; and the extraordinary, as well
as current expences of the present year, will
demand a considerable dilburfement, the
Treasury, you perceive, is abundantly re
plenilhed, and will jollify a liberal attention
â¦o all the objefta of public necessity and im
pravement, which have been submitted to
your consideration. To these, let me add,
-that upon the reprefeutations which I have
received, justice seems to require some aug
mentation of the public salaries that were
fixed antecedently to the present Govern
ment, and which have fiflce become, mani
feilly, unequal to the.mod economical sup
port of the refpeftive officers and their fami
lies.
Were it neceflary to resort to any Tax, in
order to effeftuate the purposes which are
contemplated, it w<ll be reeollefted, that in
a free country, under a Republican fyllem,
nothing can be more desirable, than that
fhould be called upon for such
pecuniary contributions, as will constantly
excite their vigilance, in scrutinizing the ad
miniflration and thee xpencetof their govern-'
ment. But, independent of this policy,
and this resource, the fees 011 a variety of
public instruments, and particularly onTav
ern an 4 Marriage Licences, might be con
venientlyand profitably increased. Thecafe
of Marriage Licences, indeed, demands at
tention 011 other principles; forthe materi
al alteration in the slate of population and
society, since the palling of the aft to pro
hibit Clandestine Marriages, mull fuggell
the propriety of considering, whether if is

In a communication to the Legislature of

intefefted in theprofperity of the union, and
have always been conspicuously attached to
the independence and hpnor of the national

which it pan never be too zealously our en

that fuccefc will attend the measures, which
i in.the adniinillration of the Federal Govern

and to revive that amity with the Freuch re

with to find congenial with the fpiiit and

MR. FENNO,
The remarks publiflied in your paper of
Tnefday were intended to the right 6f
the French to demand a role d'equipage un
founded, and that ti;e condemnation of our
veffeli and property in confequencc has been
unjust in the extreme.
I, The miflalenpolicy of those violent mea
sures mull be evident to every man whose
" maid is not jaundiced by the evil eyes of
party spirit and prejudiceâit has left
room for the enemies of France to boast
that " however justly we complained of
; fppliations on our commerce by another
i power, far greater excesses have been com
i initted by the French I" One proceeded on
j th? a\t>wed, known and defined rides and
I praftices of all nations where treaties had
not ftipulpted to the contrary ; the other in
violation of a deliberate agreement, guided
by the fuggefltions of the moment, on the
changeable fyllem of the seeming political
diftates of each day, fubmitjiug to the nar
lowfurmifes of short figbted speculative po
liticians, who, forgetful that Frasce by
changing her monarchy into a Cepublic, had
effefted a revolution in her objeds as well as~
her minillers and agents ; but they losing
fight of the design of modern crtlhajfus to Ame
rica, buried in intrigue and felfiih impor
tance the commercial, manufafturing and
trading interests of their country. Over
looking the principles they profeffed of na
tional honor, disinterestedness and justice,
(sentiments conveyed alike by the breath of
the most perfeft policy jind dignified hu
manity) they pursued the illusive, deceitful
and rifionary advice of felf created fecieties,
angry, prejudiced and defignitig dema
gogues !! ! Where no<w are those imagined
â¢warmfriends to France ? in what an unfa
vourable light have they placed her in the
eyes of United Amerita ?
Yet it. is not impossible but meafurs un
friendly (in event) to both nations may have
been advised by weak or mistaken though
well meaning men in this ; but the mmitlrrt
of FranÂ« here since the revolution had it not
in their power to give proper advice, having
.(hut the doors of information and advantage
1 against themselves and their country ; af
i tached to a party they anxioully endeavour
-1 ed to encreafe the number without eftimat
; irig the jnerit or information of the men who
. lifted under the uupromiling influence of a
1 positive or implied oppofitiou to the gov
ernment and measures of their own ; uir
> mindful of a clear truth that "he is eitlf^ r
, a bad man or of finall talents and itifluejjj c
; who exercises his genius to the injury' an( j
- prejudice of his country whose br&gj jj C
; eats." The American whose ad?j ce
- counsel should seem to favor the or
. promote the prosperity of any foreig n coun .
- try, tyhile at thÂ» fame time his.ow,, wa , b e _
- nefitted thereby and the peace, ha rmoR y an! ]
fecurit-y of it probably blended/ therewith,
1 might be listened to with fafety, an{ j perhaps
â¢ his ideas adopted with propriety ; but the
i frigid designs of lludied deceit\> r f e ]f,(h a d_
, vantage even from the lips of ihility calmly
t committing the interests of h, s OWII na tion
1 ought to be heard with appi. t l, en (i on a âJ
iuhowed with fear. It is li\ e bribing a man
- to betray his trufl and then edging him to be
-' true to you.
, The French it is evident have been told
f " you may imitate the c>, n duft of Great,
- "Britain, your friends are numerous in this
- country, you may force t.n c United 'States
e to break this treaty," forgetful of a most
- exeellent lesson of inftruftion "upon the sub
. jeftof compulfior,," " touch all that he hath
1 and he will curse thee to thy face."
In cenfequcnce however of believing this
I deceptive Counsel, certain steps and measures
s were taken, but they were varied or changed
- as often as they were always found errone
ous, inapplicable to the ground of the fifti
- tious eumplaints on which they wefe found
v ed, or to the ultimate cbjeft. At onetime
" all commercial relations were suspended."
. This could jujlly have done - nothing more
f than expoftd enemies property on board A
j merican veffcls ; which was afterwards de
-1 clared to be the design by another Ed'tS ;
a but after many modifications in order to har
-1 rafs our commerce, 'twas at length determi
, ned to take our jZips and cargoes, and a de
- mand was made of a Role d'Equipageâas
, ivellmight they fay every vejfel Jlall have a lift
r of both honfes of Congress.
s When those nnjutt things began to be
praftifed, France hail the good wilhesof all
- [ America for her fuccefs,.and the bell difpo
e I ution for her future interests universally
I ! prevailedâplans were already suggested for
1 eftablilhing a society for the promotion of
- trade, manufactures and commercial inter
s course between the two Republics, the flow
i ing fails of freedom feetned already fneeted
- home and spread from lhore to shore. At
e the-fame moment the conduft of Great-Bri
- tain itnpreffed universal resentment, anger,
I and abfolnte antipathy, a more propitiot s
1 j moment could not offer for securing the
- i friendfliip and favourable difpefuion of the
American government <aÂ«d people ; but in-
Head of embracing it tiro' tht channels of
eenm-rce, the only true political path in this
country, recourse was had to intrigue crea
ting d signs in order to di/'cover them, and ori
ginating the odious epithets of Aristocrat
and Democrat unknown amongil us before,
to divide the piople and weaken the Govern
ment l '
We were told and hear dill about a treaty
Mr. Genet was authorised to make, certain
ly we were to judge with what nation we
could make the bed bargain. How would
it be now if treaties only were to procure us be
nefits ? France is yet in too infant a lhte as
to matvufa&iires, fudderiJy to open arj exten-
IVve trade with us so as to rival Great-Bri
tain ;it must be the work of time : com
merce may be courted, influenced, shared,
biit not forced or compelled. " Trade is
tender, it is like the sensitive plant, tsuch it and
it fir in is, press it and it dies'."
A great portion of our European trade
originates in the importation of manufactur
ed goods, which creates a reciprocate com
merce. VefTels employedto bringthofe ar
ticles, must at certain periodical seasons be
at the,ports \vhere they are to load. Thus
they return to those ports tho' with cargoes
to be consumed elsewhere, or in other coun
tries, and where veffefs are lent direst to
â those other countries, it is by way of remit
tance to England, where Gsrman goods as
well as their own are obtained upon exten
sive credit. From hence results that those
who can give the longest credits only can en
ter the lift of advantageous competition, and
with that equality, those who manufa&ure
the best and cbeapefl goods nytintain it.
When France shall haveeftahlifljed'tranquil
ity at home the cheapness of living there
will nurture 'inanufadlures, and the employ
ment and application of honest industry,
now become honorable, will be lucratively
exerted ; the frniles of peace -will cherifo
the efforts of ingenuity, and the fni\ shine $f
freedom and plenty reward it ;-experiments
will be repeated till rival labor there, fue
i cefsfolly contends for rival preferenceâthen
aud not till then, can intercourse exte-nd
with us.
In the mean time repetitions of violence and
tedious temporizing may require Come remedy
free from the horrors of war, which their
fufferings though originating in a just cen
teft far their liberties, should teach us to
shun. Whatever measures are adapted to
effeft this defireable end should be fo-likt
exprefTed to all the belligerent powers that
if circumstances produce unlike efFefts thÂ«
United States be free from blame.
Recourse was had before to an embargo-,
and if Mr. Smith (S. C.) and those ger.tlen
men who generally voted with him had bee,
supported in the motion for its continuance
the aggrefTor and all the powers of Europe
intcrefted therein would quickly have con
fefifed the United States hold moil impor

or greatly distressing the poflefiions of any

solution as general as the former might now
reduce the value of grams, flow,rice,
frnmfl&nf See. It is conceived the de
sired objeft may be answered by an embargo
excepting all national vessels of war of
whatever country they may be. By such a
quali.ied rcftri&ion the mod powerful at sea

In Sir George Staunton's excellent hif

in that empire, notwithstanding payments
are made with that metal in masses of about
ten ounces, having the form of the crucible

â ffingle charafter denoting their weight. Its
value, in currency, rifts and falls according
to its relative scarcity or plenty ifTued from

ParisâGeneral PichegAi was completely
sick of travelling in a wagg6n, before his em
'barkation at Rechfort. He thought it hard
that as he had once led an army, he (hould
now travel as part of the baggage.
The fate of the French generals is rather
hard. After running, for a (hort time, A very
brilliant careef, they are either banithed,
prifeaed, or difmifled. It is the property
of tyrants to become suspicious of their a

Accounts from Manheim mention a dread
ful accident during th/military evolutions
performed before the archduke Charles,
near Schwetzingen, on the 20th ult. when,
notwithftading the precautions taken, thir
ty-fix privates and an officer were taken to
the hospital with little hopes of recovery.
The Imperial army at present encamped
in Carniola, Frioul, Carinthia, and Tyrol,
consists of 109 battallions, 68 detached com
panies, and 96 of cavalry. The artillery of

It is a fa& not generally known, that the
fatal ball which (hattered the arm of the

which, he heroically took out his handker
chief and tied up the wound of his noble re

hand, threw him over his (houlder, and car

very diminutiveinftatHre, rendered the brave

are arrived here with L'Unite frigate, and
the lark is hourly expefted. The Ameri

captains of the Antigua and Albion are ar
rived here in the privateer, but their vessels
have not been retaken, though there is a
probability that it may yet be the cafe, as
the Phaeton is gone in pursuit of them. The

It appears from the following extraft of a
letter from Alderney, of the date of

the wild and chimerical idea of inva.ding this

of such an attempt :

PHILADELPHIA,
MONDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 11.
From 'jur Char 'ejlon Correfpundrnt.
Charleston, Nov. 21. 1797.
A most daring plot has been discovered
within this week, âa number of French ne
groes, had entered into a conspiracy, and
were preparing ficerrr* ofmaflacreand/laugh
ter, fimilac to tfaofe which ravaged the Cap*.
Happily for our citizens, the plot was dis
covered before it had time to mature, and
we are thus rescued from scenes of havoc
and distress at which human nature shudders.
Two of the ringleaders were executed this
day, and a number of others are in confine
ment. The witnesses brought forward a
gainst these fellows were clear in their cri
mination, and the \rhÂ»le plot has been laid
open to our view. Chriftwas day was fixed
upon for thom to commence their bloody
workâThe magazines were to be'blown up,
and parties stationed at each of the church
doors to massacre the citizens as they came
out. They chose that day for beirtg best
calculated to answer their hellish purpose*;
as they supposed that almost every person
would be in some one of the churches ; and
thus unarmed, or unprepared, fall an easy
facrifice to their bloody dffigns. By firiig
the town in different parts they would have
created confufion, and men, women and
children would have been massacred' without
the pofiibility Â«f resistance.
The discovery of this bufrnefs, Â«vaÂ« as fal
lows ; two mulattoyoung fellows belonging
to a French gentleman by the name of La
Bvter having overheard so much of the con
verfatioft of the twoÂ»fellowt executed this
day [Jean Louis, belonging to Mr. Robi
net the cooper, and Figaro, belonging to
Messrs. Frink and Langftaff] as led thcoa
to apprehend another St. Domingo affair,
earnestly solicited their master to lepe
this country ; he, however, paid no at
tention to their request ; but a (hort
time after oic of these young men was so
licited to join the conspirators with thÂ« of
fer of the command of a company. He im
mediately communicated ihis to his master,
who advised him to pretend to give into
their schemes, and thus draw forth a com
munication of the whole plot. This he did,
and Mr. La Berter giving information to
the intendant, 15 of the conspirators were
arrettedâtwo of them were condemned to
be hungâthree to be transported, and the
remainder were remanded for further exam
ination.â Every thing is quiet at prifentâ
The citizens mount guard nightly as a m;a
fure of precaution ; but no apprehtnfions
are entertained of any difturbancea.

NEW-YORK, December 6.
That monarchy which isconftituted by
the free ihoice of d nation, is a legitimate go
vernment. That republic which is erefted
by force, despotism.
That monarchy which governs hy"Jixed
laws, enafted by the will ps a nation, is a
free government. That republic, which is
not governed hyfixed laws, or whose consti
tuted authorities can violate the laws with
impunity, is an arbitrary, tyrannical gov
ernment.
Ehthtifiafts are governed by names and
imaginary theories. An Enthufialt <n a le
giflativc body is as dangerous as a madman.
Give me a republic, l3ys the enthusiast,
and lam fatisfied. Give me a free govern
ment, fays the sober rational (latefman, and
I am fatisfied.
A republic I will have, fays the demo
cratical maniac. If my fellow citizens will
submit to my will and choice, and live under
ft lieu of the
a v?public, very well ; if not, I will mile
tliem submit. Every man who does not
think as I do, is a traitorâand death or
banifhaient awaits him.
Says the rational citizen, I prefer a re
public ; but the will or choice of a majority
:nf my fellow citizens must decide what form
of government is- most proper for the society
50 which I belong-. To that will I submit,
because it is the only legitimate source of
power. A monarchy or arillocracy found
ed by that will, is a lawful governmentâa
republic not founded on that will, is ttfurpa
tion.
111 government as in religion men wrangle
about names and forms. Whether men ar;
pagans, mahometans or christians, would be
of 110 to civil society, if one
feft would let the other alone ; nor is it a
matt er of any moment, what is the form of
government over a nation, provided it is es
tablished by eh'/tce. In religion, all men
have to do, is to let each other alone. In
government the nation (hoiild be free to
cboofe, and whatever form is cho'fcn, the
ehoice (hould be acquiesced in.
HALIFAX, (N. C.) November, 27.
Extradt of a letter from Raleigh, dated
November 21.
" Yesterday the General Afiembly met.
The Senate made choice of Gen. E. Smith
as speaker ; the House of Commoiiirballot
ed for a speaker last evening, and the votes
between M. Matthews,Efq. andjohn Skin
ner, Esq. were equalâconsequently no ap
pointment was madeâThis morning there
was another balloting, when Mr. Matthews
was elefted by a majority of four."
Much business of a very interclling nature
will come before Congress, and will proba
bly be difeuffed with great warmth :âThe
depredations made upon our commerce,with
the other effects of our neutrality, and our
fituicion between hottile nations, will cer
tainly form thÂ« bafisof principal regard.â
The jealous prying eyes of Europe will
watch our motions.
The present situation of our legillature
and executive officers is delicateâlt is aw
ful : The Congress of 1776 had scarcely
less depending on them .â¢ âFirmness, calm
ness, accurate examination of fafts before
resolving, and derision in executing their
resolutions, are at all times necessary in rulers
but have ever been more so than at the jre
fent moment.
