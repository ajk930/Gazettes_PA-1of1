AT a jundture when the question of
a Commercial Treaty zvitb France may l'oon
become an objeit of difcufiion, a work of this kind
becomes extremely u'elui to those citizens of the
United States, who may be dcfirons to enable them
feives to view this Aibjeft, under its various af
pe<sls ; and they will have the fatisfadion to be
furniftied with the neceflary data, to judge of the
ufeiulnefs of this tranfadion.
This work is principally distinguished by the
richnefsof the obfervarions, the pcrfpicuity of thÂ«
i*'cas, and the modesty of the theory which it
contains. At Pars, a man of wit observed, that
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufeful produce. It is addrcf
fed to the unfortunate La Favitte, in letters,
which fugitive form, the author who could only
devote a lew weeks ro this occupation, was obliged
to adopt. Although circumftaners are'in many
refpeds different at the present day, from what
they were in the year 1790, when these letters
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so ma
ny abfoluteand permanent data still remain, that
the ju'licious reader will not appreciate the work
lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of
the alterations, which have been made, are the re
sult of the author's remarks, it will serve to con
vince him that in all tranfaAions, between free
nations, every thing may be cxpe&ed from the ef

than Great Britain to supply us with several articles,

er to the latter; the author's patriality tjfcft on (if he
has a docs not appear to have at any time created
a partiality of judgment. Ihe result of this calculaiioa
is that in <789, that it to fay, at a period when arts
and manufactures did Â»ot present in France the vatt
means and probability of extension which they now
poflVfs. that even in 1789, it was prefumablc, that
France would not only have the means to supply one

with Great Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wisdom of her government, and the industry

F R IDA Y FEBRUARY 9.
( Continued Jrtm ytJienUy t GaxttU.) b]
The queftioo on the refolutien as amend- w
ed was aboÂ«t to be put ; when w
Mr. Gallatin said, he knew how late e<
in the day it was, and therefore his remarks w
(hould not be lohg; bat, as he cpnfidered v
there was a point of view in which the sub- 01
jest had not bren placed, he wished to far
a few words before thequeftion was taken. 'f
Ob the faft itfelf, he had no remark to
make; the evidence was direst, and all could
draw their inferences from it. Nor did he Â£
e6nfider it very material, whether the iufult
arose from provocation, or not, because he
did not think that any provocation could
juftify an indecency of that nature. But 0
it appeared to him that gentlemen who ex- P
pressed so much sensibility on the occasion, j"*
had confined themselves wholly to the inde
cency committed within the walls of the
bouse, without taking any notice of the na- 0
ture of the punishment proposed to be in- f
Aided. It was on that part of the fubjeft, 11
and on that alone, he meant to make some f
sbfervatioos. JÂ®
Our government, he said, was a govern
ment by representation. The people of (he n
United States had not vested power with a ll
fparinghand ; they had given all out e
of their handfc, but they had guarded against d
nbufe of it. T ev had said, this pow
er (hall not be exerciftd but by persons ap- F
painted by ourselves. This being the cafe, ''
said Mr. G. we, the representatives of the J
pct.ple, have only a limited power over in
dividual representatives in our tody. It is
true, the Constitution has given us thepow- 1
er of expulsion, but under as much caut'wn 1
as power could be given. It is guarded by
making it Â«eceffary to have a vote of two
thirds of the members presentâthe frme
caution which was laid upon the Senate with 1
refpeft to treaties. He conceived that the
power of expulsion had not been given for
tile piirpofe of indalging our sensibility ; for
the purpose of impairing the principle of
representation, but for the purpose of enforc
ing that principle ; and two cases might ex
ist in which the power of expulsion lodged j
in that house might be considered as a fafe
guard to the principle of representation. â
These two cases were, when the house dif
(rovered a person to be difqualified by Come
infamous conduct from voting, and when a
member pertinaciously interrupted and pre
vented public business from being carried on.
As to t>_" firft cafe, he could not suppose
that any man would ever be sent to that
hotife, who had heen guilty of any crime J
that would difqualify him from holding Iws
feat, if the people who sent him knew it at
the time; but if any such crime (hould be
afterwards committed, or be discovered to
have been heretofore committed, then the
house has a right to expel and fesd such a
member back to his conftituepts. The pre
sent cafe, every oae will allow,does not come
within this rule. The charge against the
member from Vermont, is a grots indecen
cy, which (hews the want of good manners
â;> want of good breeding. There could
be no doubt the aft washighly indecent; but
it did not (hew a corruption of heart. It
may diftjuaUfy him from associating with
fotn gentlemen on this floor; btft fait' Mr.
G- we do not come here to associate as indi
viduals, but to deliberate upon legislative
ful jests in our representative capacity. We
may, if we plcafe, associate together, ov wo
may let it alone. He did net think himielf
compelled to associate with any member of
this house whose. society he did not iike
This wasnot then one of thofecafes which
dTfcoveted a cor. option of heart, that would
#ifqualify a n*n from giving a vote on a le
giluive fubiert, though it might (hew the
per n'tc bf (qualified for polite society.
He would goo* to the other cafe, which
was ;ki to be a good reason for expulsion.
He allowed that cases might exist, in which
a man might so far pertift in interrupting the
public business of that house, by his disor
derly behavior, as to render it necessary, in I
order that the business might proceed, that
he ftiould be expelled. This led him to en
quire whether this was the cafe under con
federation, and whtther the house had been
interrupted by the aft in question.
When Be put qiieftions to the witnesses
in relation to the order of the house, at the
time the aft complained of took place, he
did it not with a view of lessening the of
fenceitfclf. He did not mean to enquire
â¢whether the member from Vermont had com
mitted a left degree of indecency, bccaufe
the house was in one situation than it would
have been if it had been in another ; but
his objeft was to (hew, that the public bu
siness bad not been interrupted, and that
the house was in a situation in which it could
not have been interrupted. It was true the
speaker had, in the morning, taken the
chair, and the house had not adjourned ;
but it must also be allowed, that the house
was not at that time organired. What was
the kufinefs before the house ? A commit
tee of two members were counting the votes
for managers of an impeachment. Were
they interrupted ; or could they be inter
rupted by an incident of this kind ? He was
sure they were sot interrupted. If then
the public business was not interrupted, and
if the faft was rtot of that nature which
(hewed a corruption of heart, he did not
think it would be proper to expel the mem
ber from Vermont.
He saw, indeed, that it was unpleafaat
for some gentlemen to fit in the house with
the member from Vermont. He allowed
it was an evil; but what is the evil, he as
ked, on the other fide ? It is thisâThey
all knew that a new eleftion could not take
place in the state of Vermont for several
wÂ«Â«ks. HÂ« remembered, fiÂ«ra the con-
tested eleftion which wts formerly before th
the house from that state, that twelve days f;c
notice is requisite before writs can be issued; pi
a certain time would be required to bring be
the votes to the governor ; the necessary m<
notice, a new eleftion, afcertiining thjtre- th
turn, the notification to the member cleft- of
ed, ind the time necessary for his journey an
hither, would take up many weeks ; and th
by the laws of that state, if there be not a fr.
majority in the firft vote, a new eleftion ar
will be necessary ; so that it may be pretty to
certainly said, that if the present member hi
was expelled, one half of the state of Ver- A
mont would be deprived of a representation to
on that floor for the remainder of the feflion. th
And (hall we, said Mr. G. in order to grat- re
ify our fenfibijities, deptive one half of that a[
state, for a number of weeks, and perhaps w
for the whole feflion, of its representation ? b<
He was not willing to do so, and therefore b<
(hould vote against the resolution. ft
He knew that other gentlemen on that
floor had as great regard for the principle m
of representation as he ; therefore, he sup- j 1"
posed, they had considered this fubjeft al- ei
ready, and made up their minds upon it. ' w
When he darted these re'afons he did not 'cl
doubt they had had weight upon the minds I t;
of other gentlemen. For his part, how- jI s
ever, he was more apprehensive of depriv- tl
ing Vet mont of its representation, than of c
any ether consideration arising from the sub- t<
jest. J
He thought genetlemen had laid too w
much ftreft 011 this indecency, as it affefted tl
the legislature of the United States. How- Â«
ever difa'greeable the aft was in itfelf, he si
did not think becaufa a member sent thÂ«re ft
by the people of Vermont does an impro- h
per aft, that it could attach difgraee and b
indelible infamy to the house itfelf, nor did si
he fee how it could affeft any other person
besides the member from Vermont himfelf. c
Two members ,rising, though the quest
tion was loudly called for, the committee li
rose, by a small majority, and had leave to v
fit again, j'
< Y
MONDAY âFEBRUARY J2. c
The House having resolved itfelf info a Ceieimittee *
> of the Whole, on the Report of the Committee a
of Privileges, IVr. DÂ»nt in the Chair, 1
Mr. Rut-ledge denied that any similar" c
outrage had ever been committed in that r
house like the present, though the gentle- t
man from Virginia had spoken of something a
analagous. It was true a challenge had t
been sent by a raember of the Senate to a e
member of that house ; but this was not at c
all comparable to the present offence. Mr. I
R. thought the punishment by expulsion, t
was the only punishment which could be a- !
dopted, bs nothing ftiort of it would be ef- I
fectUal. 1
Mr. Findley said, the question before t
the committee was a qweftion of indecency, j
and not of crime ; and he wifned, for the 1
fake of decency, so much had not been said 1
upon it. In forming the Constitution there '
had been a diftinftion made betwixt punish
ment and expulsion. Expulsion was evi- j
dently the highest punifiiment which the '
house could infiift, but 110 one could fay in- 1
decency was the highest crime. He never ]
understood, either at the time the Conftitu- j
tion was formed, or since, that expulsion 1
u<3 intended to be applied to any thing but 1
crimesâfor what would be a fubjeft of im- 1
peachment ih other bodies, where impeach
ments '"could be brought. This was not,
therefore, an opinion formed upon the spur 1
of the occasion. Mr. F. said, he knew, of 1
an inllance of this kind which happened in
another legislative body, upon which a com
mittee was appointed to consider it, but
they never made report, but hÂ«ld their de
cision in terrirem over the offending member.
He thoTTght, if a similar course had been ta
ken in this matter, it would have been pre
ferable tÂ« spending so much time in debate
upon it.
Mr. Sewall rose to reply to what fell
from Mr. Gallatin en Friday, with refpeft
to the two cases which he pointed out, as
coming under the rule sot expulsion, and
referred to the law of Parliament in Eng
land, to (hew that his doftrine was ill found
ed. He said uo diftrift Â»f country ought
to have it in its power to fend a man amongst
them as a legislator for the United States,
who (hould be hateful to two thirds of the
house. The Constitution had defined no
particular cases in which the power of ex
pulsion (hould be exercised ; the house was
therefore left at liberty to use it according
to its (JifcretioÃ: Atd if it were to be a
bused, instead of punishment it might be
come the higheji honour to the perfo* expel
led, as if the house were become so corrupt
tis to expel a person without just cause, it
knight people to a sense of the
necessity of changing iheiÂ£ reprefentat'mei.â
Mr. S. said, it was a new doftrine that the
business of the house (hould aftually be in
terrupted, before a person (hould be deemed
an offender against its rules. It was neces
sary to look at the consequence of aftions,
j and referred to what might have been the
cafe if Mr. Grifwold had resented the af
\ front upon the spot. Mr. S. spoke of the
importance of this decision as a precedent;
[ and of the danger to be apprehended from
theconduftof Mr. Lyon in future, if the
present outrage was fuffered to pass with
s out exemplary punishment, and that it
would be necessary to come armed to the
'house in order to guard themselves against
t him.
Mr. fpake again upon this sub-
I jest. If the Imember from Vermont, was
not expelled, he fuppefed it would break
t up the present feflion, without dÂ«ing any
butiaefs ; that it would divide the ftatcs a
gaiaft each other, aod finally end ia a civil
|t war.
Mr. Pinckniy said, in order to insure
j perfeft freedom of debate, it was necessary
j- to repress every perfenal violence in the firft
instance. In conlidering this question hp
confidered it as fixing a rule for their go
aj vernment in future, and he thought if it
were so considered, (ar.d no reference had to
the dil'pute which had produced the discus- ft
; (ion) there would be a pretty unanimous ob
; pinion that an offence of this kind ought to ,
; be punilhed by expulsion. He thought a a
â  member thus violently offending the rules of t!
the house, should. be immediately deprived h
â  of the pÂ»werof.the people in that house,
r and it was on this ground that he moved for v
I the immediate commitment of the member t
i from Vermont to the care of the sergeant at h
i arms, when the offence was firlt made known t
r to the honfe, not anly for the feeurity of g
r his perfen, bui for immediate punilhment. t
- As the conÂ£h'tÂ»tion gave the house a power i
i to expel a member for disorderly coiiduft he 1
. thought this cafe came clearly within the t
- rule. In some cases of offence, there might f
t appear mitigating circumstances, but there c
s was none in this. The conduct of the mem- t
?! ber fincc the tranfaftion was committed had o
e been such as to convince the house that he 1
felt no compunftion for what he had done. I 'J
t Mr. Livingston rose to intreat gentle- â¢ c
e men, its they valued the refpeftability of the 1
i- ! House, the good opinion of their conftitu- : '
I- â  ents, and the public Treasury, that they f
| would fuffer this bufmefs to come to a eon- i r
i clnfion. Their cosftituents, he was cer-â¢ c
s ! tain, had long been tired of the difcuflion. '
â¢- i Nearly 20 days, which had cost as many i
| thousand dollars to the country, had been I
if | consumed in this bufmefs. Gentlemen rose '
i. to express their abhorrence of abuse, in abu- '
Jive terms, and their hatred of isdecent adts 1
0 with indecency. The simple question before â  !
d the house was, what degree of punifhmeni '
r. was proper to be inflifted upon the member '
e from Vermont. [The Chairman informed
e Mr. L. he was mistaken in faying 20 day*
>- had been confnmed in this bufmefs; it had 1
d been before t!Â»e house only fourteen.] Mr. L. '
d {aid it was in a fair way for being twenty. 1
n Mr. Co it was sorry to hurt the feelings
of the gentleman latt up, by faying any '
f. thing on this fiibjeft, but having been con- 1
re fidered as as advocate of Mr. Lyon, he 1
.0 would makea few observations upon the sub- 1
jest. He did not himfelf think that this 1
vote ought to have been taken without dif- 1
cuflion. If, indeed, it had been necessary
to have enquired how does this man gener
8e ally vote, then no difcuflion wa* necessary;
but he could not corifider that this was the
ir' only enquiry necessary to be made. With
it refpeft to the faft, nothing need be said,
e- every one allowed it to be brutal, indecent
g and unmannerly. The constitution gave
id the house the power of expulsion for diford
a erly coudu&. It had been said, this difor
at der must be committed within the house; but
r. he found nothing of this iort in the confti
-11, tution. He had 110 doubt himfelf that the
a- House was in ftflion at the time. It had
f- been attempted to {hew that there was a pro
vocation for the offence; but an enquiry in
re to this matter turned wholly agaiuft the
y, gentleman from Vermont, as his previous a
le bufe of the whole representation of Connec
id ticut was a fuffieient ground for the retort
re which was drawn fiom his colleague. It
h- appeared, therefore, to him, that te retain
n- amongst them a man of this description,
be was to retain a man who would produce no
n- thing but disorder and confufion in their
er proceedings. Hisletter of apology did not
u- fay that this was a tranfaftion of heat, and
jn that he was sorry for it, but that he was for-
Jt ry the hsufe had thought it necessary to
n- take cognizance of it; and his defence be
ll- fore the committee of the whole, was far
't, from being contrite; it was, indeed, an at
ur tack upon the wrtneffes, in order to invali.
of date their testimony. He hoped the refol
in ution would be agreed to.
n- Mr. R. Williams rose and took notice
ut of the different arguments urged in favour of
e- the amendment. He denied that the corn
er. mittee ought to consider the confequencea to
a- which an aft might possibly lead; if so, an
*e- assault would, of course, be punilhed equally
.te with murder, as it might poflibly lead to it.
He did not think the house ought to inter
ell fere any further, than to prefcrve order and
ft decorum in its proceedings If a member
as of the house committed a crime, he was an
nd fwerable to the law* equally with any other
g- mas. Upon the whple, he conidered the
'd- proposed punilhment as disproportionate to
ht the offence, and should, therefore move an
sft amendment. [He then moved the amend
es, ment stated in yesterday's minute, confining
he the punishment to a reprimand by the Spea
nÂ° ker in the face of the house.]
â x- Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) said the
â as length of the present debate had been com
ng plained of; but who, he asked, had firft
*" broke silence after the gentleman from Maf
3C" fachufetts (Mr. Thatcher) had expressed
el- his wi(h that the vote might be taken with
â P 1 but debate? It was the gentleman just fat
down; and now he had given the committee
he another .speech, and introduced a proposi
tion.calculated to produce further difcuflion.
: ' le He wishes the gentleman from Vermont to
in- he reprimanded by the Speaker. What
led could the Speaker fay to him? He could
ef- only fay, " Tou have done an aS -which would
ns Â» difgracc a blackguard, time and take your feat
the m the house ; you have in fulled us with words
*f" which Jbcw your defiance of us, but come and
ft with ut, and be our brother Legislator."
>t; Were these proper words to be addressed
om to the member ?The Speaker would sooner
the addrefi him in words of Thunder which
th- {hould drive him from his presence. Mr. D.
; then took notice of what fell from the gen
tle tleman from New-York with refpeft to the
inft lengthsf the present debate, which bethought
fully juflified by the importance of the fnb
"h- jest, and concluded by faying, that if there
(hould be found a majority in this house
Â«k i n favour of the amendment, he should be
any ashamed of having Â« feat in it.
I 'â  Mr. Nicholas hoped the committee
;ivil would not be prevented from doing what it
thought propor, because there > might be a
u re difference betwixt the private â¢pinion Â«fthe
fiiry Speaker, and what he might be called upon
firft to do in his capacity as Speaker,
hf Mr. R. Williams denied that he was
go- the-firft whÂ« began the debate,
if it Mr. Dayton repeated that he was the
>d to firft whe brtke fileuce after the gtotlcman
frÂ«m Massachusetts had wiflicd the vote to r
- be taken without debate.
, ; Mr. R. Willimas said, that it would f;
1 appiar from the manner in which the gen- ii
f tleman had said he broke the silence, that he d
1 had begun the debate, which he did not. c
, Mr. W. said he was now more Ilrongly con- \
r vinced than ever of the impropriety of ex ii
r tending the power of expulsion, since hehad L
t heard the paflionate expreflions of the gen- ii
1 tleman from Ncw-Jerfy. Was this the lan, 'y
f fÂ£ ua K e a J ut^Â£e â¢* wou onl y P a f 3 t
. the law upon the offender, but he would da t
r it with thunder and v .-f:geanÂ«e. In his opin- \
e ion, Mr. W. said, eothing would tend more 1
e to difgracc the councils of America than
t such heated language as this. It was fuffi
e cient to induce the People to fay," we have
1- too much libertyâtoo much freedom of fpeechâ
d our government is bad," and to be ready to \
c lay hold of any other that is offered to them j {
!-A sentiment of this kind tended .more to . c
. destroy the government than any thing he f
,e had heard. Gentlemen talk of heat in de- j <
i- bate ; but where did it come from ? Not 1
y ' from the gentlemen in opinion with him, 1
1- ; must be evident to every one. Whatever j
r. i opinion might beheld of his amendment, <
1. he thought it proper, and therefore made j
y it ; nor did he think it l-.beral in any man ; 1
n to treat it as it had been treated. Was it I
fe right to be told by a member, because he | 1
t . moved an amendment like the prefeut, that; 1
ts he {hould be ashamed to fit with him ? Was j
e â  this what the public expedled to hear in its I
il legislative councils ? He believed not. He
:r thought it would dÂ» no credit to him who
d uttered the sentiment.
r, Mr. Dayton said that the gentleman
d 1 from N. Carolina had mis-stated what he
j. had said in several instances ; but he did not
think it worth while to fct him rightâit
s would be a wafte'of time and words. There
y was one thing he would notice, he called
him a Judge. *Was he nÂ®t in committee of
ie the whole on this fuÃjtift ? Was he more
3. a judge than that gentleman ? [Mr. W
is offered to explain]. Mr. D. said the gen
s- tleman had already four times explained him
â¢y felf. If he had any thing more to fay to that
r- gentleman, it would be a little more poin
r; ted. He should fay what he pleased, and if
,e he chose he might call upon him in the house

ut had said as to the impropriety of theSpeak

ie as the language of a majority he wa* afiured
ad would dirett him thus to speak, and he could
o- not be expected to use the fentimÂ«nts of a
n- minority in his reprimand. He had stated
he the matter in a strong light, to {hew the ira
a- propriety of the measure ; and he meant to
c- appeal to the breast of every honorable gen
rt tleman whether the members of that house

in Mr. Goodrich thought to have given
n, afilent vote on this fdbjeft ;but when a pro
-- position likethe present was brought forward
tir he could not refrain from delivering his fen

Far es of this member; they differed only as to

ili. nothing short of expulsion would be fufÃci

that a reprimand would not be confiderÂ«d by
Ice him a3 any punishment at all. He knew
of not how to account for the strange manner
m- in whieh he had conduced himfelf since he
to committed theinfult upon his colleague; ex
an cept, indeed he was persuaded, that d* what
lly he will, it was not in the power of the house

an The reprimand proposed, he was confident
id- would have no effe& upon him; betides it
ng was a puniftiment of the lightest kind which
ea- the house could inflift, and by no means pro
portioned to the highest poflible outrage. â
:he He corresponded in sentiment with the gen
m- tleman from New-Jersey with refpeft to
irft this amendment, and if it were approved
; a f- by a majority, he (hould feel ajhamed and
fed degraded at belonging to that house. If this
th- were the safe, every man who had any re
fat gard for his charafter, would make his e
tee scape from the polluted habitation, as such a
afi- vote would jittach dfgrace and infamy to the
an. house, because it was an old and true adage,
to "He who does not repel vile aÃs, participates
hat it the infamy.
uld- Mr. Sitgriavss said, if this amend
uld ment prevailed(and he trusted it would not)
feat it could only be upon one of two confidera
rds tions ; both of which had been ftiggefted
2nd in the course of the debate, viz. the sup
' posed want of power in the house to expel
Ted a member for an offence of this kind, or that
ner the punishment is not proper for the offence,
ich Mr. S. went into a variety of arguments

en- founded, examined the different theories
the which had been laid down ai applicable to
g ht the power of expulsion given by the confti
nb- tution, endeavoured toprove that the offence
lere under consideration was of the highest mag.
mfe nitude, and that, therefore, it ought to be
be punished with the highest punishment which
the house has the power of inflifting, which
:tee is expulsion. A mere reprimand, he said,
it it was by no means, a proper punishment, it
be a was applied to offences of the lowed kind
the merely. Theft being his views of the fub
poÂ» jest, he should vote agaiuft the amendment
and if it were to prevail, he {hould vote a

such a measure securing them from future
the injuries, it would only encourage them;

with it, Gut leave every gentleman to pro
test his own honor. It will tVju br neces
sary for them, not only to bring learning and
information to Congress, but also a fufiicient
degree of flrength and courage, or if defici
cient in strength, arms for their defence:
With refpeft to ihe length of this difciiflion
it was wholly owing to that part of the
hoiife who declined to aft upon the business
immediately, but who chose to havÂ« the fub
jeft referred to a committee, and afterwards
to have the evidence before a committee of
the whole, and not to those who have al
ways been ready to adopt the mod prompt
measures.
(Debate to be continued.)
TUESDAY FEBRUARY 13.
Mr. Otis from the committte to whom
was referred that part of the Present's
speech which has relation to foreign Consul*
| direfted him to aflc leave Â»to be discharged
! from the consideration of that business, in
order that it might be referred to the com
: raittee of the whole to whom has beeri refer
| red the bill providing for the expences o(
! government for the year 1798,, as an item
! cauld be introduced into that bill without
â  going through the formalities of a bill for
; the purpose.
This motion was opposed by McfT. Gal
-1 latin and Nicholas, as they were not certain
' that the expences alluded to were auttiori
fed by law ; and if they were not, it would
be proper to authorise the expences, be
fore they appropriated money to pay them.
The motion was put and negatived, 37
to 33-
The meflage yesterday received from the
Prefideiit of the United States was read as
follows :
" Gentlemen of the Senate unci
Gentlemen of the house of representatives,
" In obedience to the /aw, I now present It
both houfts of congress, my "annuOi account of

TreaJ'ury a balance of 15,494 dollars and 24
cents, fubjefi to fuiure dfpofilions of govern
ment.
JOHN ADAMS."
" United States, Feb. 12, 1798."
It was ordered to be printed.
A meflage received from the senate,
informing the house, tint they had pafleda
bill for the sale of lands in the North-wes
tern territory ; and that they had also pas
sed the bill for the relief of the refugees
from Canada and Nova-Scotia, with amend
ments.
Mr. Harper, from the committee of ways
and means, made a report in favor of ereft
ing a light-house in the harbor of George
town (S. C.) the Nieeeffary cefFion of the
foil having been made to the United States.
Referred to the committee of the whole to
\yhom has been referred the bill making ap
propriations for the support of government
for the year 1798 ; which bill afterwards
coming under consideration, an item was
introduced into it, providing for this ex
pence. *'
Mr. Coit reported a bill in addition to
an aft for promoting the progress of the
ufeful arts, which was committed for mon
day next.
The speaker laid before the house a letter
which had been received by the Clerk f.-om
thje legislature of Virgieia, inclofingan au
thorised copy of their agreement to the a
mendment proposed to the conftitutiop ref
pefting the suability of states. Ordered to
lie on the table.
Mr. Livingllon, from the committee of
â  commerce and manufaftures, reported a bill
for erefting a light-house on Eaton's Neek,
and for placing buoy 6 in the several places
; therein mentioned. Committed for Monday.
The fame gentleman also made a report
. on the petition of Sylyanus Crowell, mana
ging owner of three schooners employed in
the cod fifhery in the year 1796, but a fire
1 having destroyed the agreements between
â  the owner, matters and crews, he was pre
â¢ vented from receiving the bounty allowed
1 by law. The committee finding there was
at lead prima facia evidenee of the faft, re
port favorably and recommend a bill for his
: relief, which report was concurred in by the
1 house.
Mr. Otis presented a petitiodMrom Moses
Gill, praying paylnent of the principal aad
interest of 840* dollars laid out in fix per
1 cent. Loan-Office Certificates iffhed by the
I state of Georgia during the war. Also the
1 petition of Elias Strong, praying to have
s remitted certain duties on fait destroyed by
fire at Boston. The former was referred to
the committee ef the whole to whom has
t bee* referred the report on the expediency
: of excepting certain claims from the opÂ«raf
, tion of the limitation afts ; the latter to
r the committee of commerce and manufac
tures.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee tf
) claims, made an unfavorable report on .the
- petition of John Jarvis, a soldier in the late
1 war, who prayed for compensation for da
- mages done to his property, which was coiir
1 curred inby the house.
t The Speaker said the business firft in or
. der was the unfinished business of (he bill
s providing for our istercourfe with foreign
!1 nations.
s Mr. Gallatin moved to postpone the uÂ»-
3 finifhed business, for the purpose of taking
- vp the bill making appropriations for the
e support of government for the year 1798,
â¢- as government was at present drawiag me
e ney by way of anticipation. There
h also a report of the committee of claims,
h or the fubjeft of excepting certain claims
I, fiom the operation of the limitation afts,
t which he thought it would be well soon to
d aft upon, as tie delay of it, might induce
i- fpeculationj, whkh it would be better to
t prevent.
l- After some few objeftions to a poftpone
n ment of the unfinilhed bufinefi, it was, at
e length, agreed to postpone it for the pur
- pole of taking op the appropriation bill.
o The house aceordingly resolved itfelf iitoa committee of the whole on the-bill appro*
priating sos the support of government for
the year 1798, Dent in the chair ; and
after having agreed to the various items
therein contained, with little or no debate,
the committee rose, and the house concur
red in the amendments which had been a
greed to in the committee of the whole,
and the bill was ordered to be engrofled for
a third reading.
Mr. Sitgreaves hoped the house would
go into a committee of the whole, oil the
report of a feleft committee on the memo
rial of the people called quakers.
Mr. Rutledge wished this ftibjcÂ£l might
be deferred till to-morrow, as he thought it
would be proper to introduce an amendment
into the report, which he was not at that
time prepared to make.
Mr. Sitgreaves consented.
Mr. Coit thought it was deflrable to in
troduce an amendment to the Handing rules
and orders ef the house. For this purpose
he proposed the following resolution:
" Resolved, that the following be added
to the Handing jules and orders of this house
" That no question (hall be taken up for re
eonfideration, when there (hall be a fmalkr
number of memhprs present, than were pre
sent when the original vote wes passed."
Agreed to, and refered to a committee
of five members.
Mr. D. Foster called for t\ie order of the
day on the bill for the relief of Oliver Pol
lock ; which being agreed to, the House re
folved'itfelf into a committee of the whole
â¢n this bill, and after some debate, it was
negatived 35 to 24. The committee rose,
when a motion was made to postpone the
further eonfideration of this bill, which mo
tion not appearing to be very acceptable
another motion was made to adjourn, which
wascarried by the calling vote of the Spea
ker, there being 37 to 37.
Adjourned.
ALBANY, February 6.
In the course of the debate in congress on the
Foreign Intercourse Bill, Mr. Nicholas, mem
ber from Virginia, declared, at his opinion,
" that peace with the French republic might
lave been secured, but that the executive hH
wantonly cafi it from us " Tis no matter how
plainly the oppoferÂ»of the measures of govern
ment fprak out : they ne*tr have had their de
signs exposeâ ! in the national house of rtprefen
tatives more fully than in/he course ef the de
bate inferred to ; and never have they appear
ed to have felt themselves more completely plac
ed on the " Jive footed bed," than it appears
they are by the decidtd and open language of
the fppporters of government on this occasion.
The gall of faction ha? descended in showers ;
but its contaminating eff*<9s will be retrenched,
as the cloven foot is more fully exhibited to the
public. Theexecutive to whom this said Ni
cholas alludes, as having " wantonly caj} peace
fom uj," is Georgi Washington : and the
mention of thisfaft is fufficient, without enter
ing into a detail of all the measures which have
been pursued to induce the French to a<3 with
jufiice towards us ; a detail which could make
no other impreflion upon the public mind than
that the political guardians of this country had
done every thing ia their power to preserve to
us the bleflings of peace, short of a total Sacri
fice of our independence*
A just sense of the evils of war, might operate
with government, (if it should eventually prove
that all measures hitherto adopted have been
ineffectual,) to fend three or even fix more en
voys to France, if it could be af/ertaincd that
such additional humiliation would fecurt, on the
part of the French, a refpeil for our property
and rights hut the fending a score of envoys
would not fatisfy our jacobins ânor would any
propAfitions they could make, short of a surren
der of our sovereignty to the ruling powers in
France, probably be considered as meriting at
tention.
When an envoy was sent from this country
to obtain an adjuftraent of our ifferences with
England, and to claim redress for the depredl
tions upon our commerce, he was received With
politeness, and reereft promised ; thole prom
ife. in many iuftances have been fulfilled ; and
if credit can be given to our agents in F.ngland
the courts of justice there are proceeding to a
ward retribution for property illegally captured
as faft as the necefTary proofs are exhibited.
Not only previous to, but during the course of
\he negociation, the whole vocabulary of oppro
brium was ransacked by our modejldemocrats for
epithets to apply to the English. A citizen ot
the firft refpeiftability in this country was sent
to France to endeavour to establish a good undr*
(landing between that nation and America ;
and how was he treated ? With nogleit and ig
nominy Three commissioners have been, since
that period, sent to make another effort ; and.
at the last dates, they were not received : and
now, beeavife the tyrants of Franee are charact
erized as they ought to be, the blood r,f our
" patriot}" is all in foam. What a confident,
country-loving, country-refpedling set of beings
are the American Jacobins !

PROPOSALS,
BY THI
Insurance Company of North America.
For Insurance against Fim, on Dwelling-
Hoi/fes, Ware-HouseÂ», and other Buildings (and
on Goods contained in such Buildings) distant from
Philadelphia, in the United States.
I. Common-lufurancei, on hazards of the firfl
class, will be undertaken at a premium of about
half per cent, per annum. For extra hazardous
rifques a larger premium yill be required, which
| will vary according to circumfhnces, feidom ex
ceeding one per cent, per annum ; but in some in
ftanccs, where the property i' fured is not only in
itfclf extra hazardous, Uut rendered still more so
by the vicinity of extra hazardous building, and
occupations, the premium demanded will be raised
according to circumftinces.
Houfe# and Ware-Hcufes, the walls and parti
tions of which are wholly #f Aone or brick, well
conftruiUd, so as to bv guarded as well as may be
against fires from within, and free froaa extra ha
zardous buildings and occcupations in their neigh
borhood, will be "deemed hazardous of the iirft
class, and may be insured to their full value.
Also Goods and Merchandize, not o? an extra
hazardous kind, in calks, bales, or packages, de
pofircd in such buildings, to an amount not ex
ceeding 4000 dollars; but if more than thisfum
is required to be insured in one tenement, <an addi
tional premium will be required, in proportion to
circumftanees.
11. Insurances will also be made on buildings and
goods extra hazardous, at premiums proportioned
to the risque. Bit it is not easy to arrange theft
â nder particular heads or classes, so as to dtfciibe
each with the neccffary accuracy. Each cafe must
therefore be decided upon according to thÂ« circum
fiances attending it; and these circumftanees will,
in general, appear from the description accompa
nying the application.
Buildings partly conftruAed of brick or stone,
are preferable to those wholly wooden. And in
both cases, the stile Â»f building, how they are oc
cupied, how they are situated, the neighboring
buildings, andhow occupied, are considerations to
be taken into view. And with refj>e& tÂ» goods,
their tendency, whether front their nature, or
from the manner in which they are exposed, cither
to commence or to increase an accidental fire, and
their liability in such state to receive damage by
wet, or by sudden and hasty removal, or to be sto
len in time of confnfisn and hurry, are all cir
cunifiances of weight ; and tke premiums mufi be
proportioned accordingly.
111. The following condition! are to be nnder
floed hy the parties .
ift. The Insurance is not binding till the stipu
lated premium be paid ; but it shall be deemed ef
fectual from the time of such payment and accep
tance thereof, whether the policy be immediately
signed or not.
ad. Insurances naay be renewed at the expira
tion of the term of the policy, withont further tx
penfe. than the payment of the premium of the re
newed term,the circumflancei continuing the fume
as they were enderftood by the lnfurers at the time
the former insurance was made ; bat the payment
of the premium is cflential to such renewal ; and
if the party insured fuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former infarance, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not infnred
during such time ; nor can the insurance be renew- j
ed on the former policy but by computing the
commencement of the reoewal frÂ»m the expiration
of the former insurance. The fubjetf of infur- 4
anCe may neverthclef* be open to treaty for a new
insurance.
3d. If ary other iafuranae be made on the fame
property 5 it mnfl be made known at the trtne of
application, otherwise made Â«n suchaa- r
plication will be void. . n
4th Goods held in trnft, or on consignment,
nrty be insured as such in a separate policy ; but
they are rot to be confidcred as infaied Â»th rwlfe.
Jth. This company will not be liable or accoun
tabic for any loss or damage occasioned by any for
eign invaflon, of by any military or usurped force, -
or by feafan of any civil commotion ; or occasion
ed by gunpowder, aquafortis or other thing of the J
like kind kept in the building, or amongll the pro
perty insured. j
6th. Bills of Exchange, Bonds and other Secu- a
rities, Title Dnedi, Money, Bank and other pro-
L iiiifTVy Noses, are nor included in any MÂ»ranc* |
nor a'e paintings, medals jewels, gem., antique
or m'rror.< cxcrerliiijj the value of HvchÂ«
ty-five dollnije3e%, to fcc confirferi-d as infnredun
lefs particularly mentioned *nd by special agree
. mcnt.
Jih. Mo insurance will tie made for a f-ortrf
term than one year, nor or a logger tcrtn than le
vel# years. Fcrfnns choofirg to Â»!ure for seven
â¢ yÂ«jrs Hull be allowed one year's premium by way
of difrounr; One third oI a years premium (hall
be abated m like maaner on an infufanee far
three year.".
a Bth I.olTiisfurtained by fireon property injured,
shall be paid in thirty d<y a after due proof and li
quidation thereof, without deduction.
s A defetiption of the property to be infurod will
be cxpe&cil with oach"application, to he madu by
' a master carpenter and finned by him, as Weil ht
hy the owner of the building 01 applicant for in
surance, and attested before a Notary or principal
