of the Aultrian armies ; and of themselves
freed frem that imminent danger with which the
appeoach of the French threatened the place of
their fitting, They hasten in their Srft meeting
after the vacation, to teftify decidedly the lively
interelt which they take in, the happy events and
enterprises executed with such brilliant success un
der the (kilrul direction of liis Royal Kighnefs the
Archd ; Charles, a Prince already rendered iiluf
trious by his heroic valour and his enlarged views,
as well as by theemisent fcrvices which hehasper
farmed to the German Natioa.
Perfectly convinced of the important advantages
which hÂ»A'erefulted from the operations of the Auf
triah armiesâoperations which alone formed the
conftitntional prefervatien of the German Empire,
the Diet feel it their duty to address their molt
grateful acknowledgments to his Imperial Majesty

The dispatches receivad by government, from

are not of fnch a nature as to present to us the
cheering profpeft of an immediate peace, arc tie
verthelefs calculated te keep the object within the
limits of our view, and to preserve te all -parties the
means of attaining the great end, provideS their
profeflions are dictated by finrerity, and their de

anfvver to it, (q correal tranflatioii of which ap
peared in eur last, p. 479,) are entitled to theut
moit attention. It will appear obvious, a
perufai of them both, thac the delay whieh has
hitherto occured in the blifinefs ef the negociation
is to be afcriljed, not to any reluctance on the part
British cabinet to meet the question in a
rair and candid manner, or to their want of refpeil
to the new order of things in Fiance, but to the
formal spirit of the direiSory, who, at the fame
time that thry display an evident difpofitiou to pro :
tract the negoeiation, and manifell an obvious inat
tention to the urgent desire of the BritiHi plenipo
tentiary to enter immediately upon the fubjeft of
his mifTion, demand to have pointed out to them
the objecft of reciprocal compenfatien whieh his
iordflÂ»ip has to propose. This proceeding amounts
jo nothing left than a refufal on their part to af
ford any explanation whatever as to their views and
incentiens, although they call tipon hit' lordlhip,
before they confant to treat with him, to express
tiimfelf fully upon every point.
The manner in which lord Malmefbury's note
treats the insinuations contained in the answer of
the dire&ory to his fir ft memorial is worthy the
honor and chara&er of the, British government.

" The affair of the 24th ult. has proved equally

the enemy in their formidable entrenched position
on the heights of Schlingen. The noble army of
Conde were the firft Engaged on, that they acted
nobly there can be no doubt : the battle continued
nine successive hours. Th# archduke was every

he commands. The French, in fine, after vario.s
proofs of obflinate ferpeity, were forced from their
strong hold, and fell Uaek in difcHer, .luring -the
mglii,. towards Caltenherberg, near which place

The 2 cth, the archduke attempted to bring
the enemy to battle, but the republicans retreated
before the conqueror with the utm.ft precipitation.
Ihe foreh of Marck on the banks of the Rhine
then became their resource. That diy his royal
highneis had his head quarters at Mappach.
I he 36th e\ery preparation was made to drive
the enemy out the wood. Terrified, they made

Extract of a letter from Exeter, Xov. 13.
" A general meeting of the merchants and mi-
I nufafturers of Ecceter was held here oÂ« the loth
j inft. and the state of trade having keen taken into
sonfideration, it was unanimoufiy That from
the beginning of the war the trade of this city has
labored under great and unprecedented fliladvantages
and thai lately, by the shutting of almolt every port
in Eiirepe, te whieh the manufaiSares of this coÂ«n-,
try were exported, there appear reason to apprehend
the molt ferisus eoHtequ.ncci, the laboring poor in
thÂ»& parts being generally dep/ived ef employment
by'the total stagnation oJ' commerce.
" The following memorial to the privy ceuneil
was also drawn up and agreed to, and ordered to be
transmitted to all the manufacturing towns of Eng.
land :
" To the lords of his raajefty's most honorable
Privy Council.
" The memorial as the merchant, and manufa&u
rerÂ» of Exeter and its vicinity, assembled at a ge
neral meeting of their chamber ef commerce,
for taking into consideration the fUte of their
traae.
*â¢ The measure, of reiitff which your letdfhips
were pleased to suggest in reply te our memorial of
the 25th of July last, having been all defeated hy
iubfequent events, and the date of our trade be
coming every day more critical, we preAimeto so
licit your lerdfliip, attention to ov.r inercafed dis
tress.
" In the north of Italy our property is conlif
cated-; to the louth we have no longer access ; re
cent eecurreÂ»ce9 have rendered the navigation of
the mediterranean so perilous, that we cannot be
covered by any premium of insurance which our
trade will bear. The vessels dispatched from this
port for the fair of Salerno, by the July convoy,
to the amount as toe,oool. appear by the last ad
vices to be still at Gibraller, waiting for further co.i
voy. The Queen of Naples, another of our ves
sels worth above 40,000]. is now under aa embargo
it Genoa.
" To Spain and Portugal we look with extreme
anxiety. The ports of the former country (a chief
market of our manufactures) are not only hot a
gaiaft us, at a moment when our wareheufea and
veffd, are filled with goods preparing for the win
ter caniuraption ; but reports of-an a&ual fequef
tr<tt inn-fffp; .. . yr tt*n 'fo~
dif hirgc bills of exchange, meaftres which, if car
ried into effeift, mull be attended with fatal confe
qiienct-3. In rhefe ports also, many of oar vessels
are embargoed with caigoes to a very great amount.
" In Germany, the operations of waT ' render
credit precarious and property insecure. The mar
kets of Flanders and Holland are no longer open.
With the other parts of Europe ami of the globe
we have little intercourse.
" To this confifcation of our property, detenti
on of our funds, and annihilation of our trade, is
added an extraordinary embarrassment arising from
a failure of the usual facilities df credit.
" Your lerdfhips need not be informed that the
trade of this port consists in the exportation ef
woollen goods, raanufn&ured in this city and
t throughout the county of Devon ; a suspension
refore, ef our exportÂ®, especially under the cir.
nltances, we have enumerated, puts an entire
fxop to the industry of these parts ; and the dif
tresses of our labourers, already ' very great, mnft
loon become extreme.
Under the pressure of these evils we conceive '
we are difchargmg a duty in presenting this memo- ,
rial, that your lardfliip, way be nwart of our fitÂ«-
ation.

following oblervationsâ
1 " There ftiil, at may be Ten, the fame refufal on the
part of our mintftry to answer the firft queftirm of the En
gbfh plenipotentiary, '' Is the priaciplr of coinpealation to
be adopted, or rej. ited ? and, in ctle of rejeclioa, what is
to be fubltituted tor it ?
' ' We conceit roncffiv<: *>Â£ f f
â  policy. It icema to m, however, that, until a
fotmal explanation has been given upon-this gene
ral piinciple, there cannot exilt a right to demand
Â«f Lord Malraefbury an exact delignaiion of the ob
jcils of reciprocal compeufation. We are furry to
agree, on this jtibjetft, with the English note bat
'this agreement is nut a motive for coacealing ttuth. j
Do not the plained good sense and the molt natu
'ral realWiiing point out, in fait, this condnft ?
Why do not the Directory m.ike'known the mo
tive which induced theui to deviate from it since
it is certain they have fame Motives i After
having exclaimed so much against the antient eti
quette, and what is called the diplomatic routine,
-fl v i 11 we, fo{ an affair of form and useless refetve,
ride, at every moment the breaking off the negocia
tion, and the extinction of' the hope of peace?
What a fire thing, in a negeciatian of this fort, is
the conceited trifling of a man, who, because he
is juitly reproached with having uttered iiyfenfe,
appears refolvcd to fpe3lt uo more ! How'can tt(e
Dirc&ory avoid feeing, ihat insensibly, and in spite
Â©f them, we are tending to that point at which no
thing will re-nain for him but to order the depart
ure of the Erglifh ajrent from Frrfnce ; and that,
if the Court of London, as is very poiiible, isinlm
cere, it can-desire nothing more ardently than thus
to place on its own fide all the appearances of paci
fic intentions, in order to conciliate the opinion of
Europe, to make the war popular, and u> raise
the public fpfntin England ? How can they be
ignorant t hat j by such haifh nnd infignificant an
swer* as they permit to be given in their name b\
their Minister they put all the advantage of tiie ne
gociation on the lide of Lord fctiry : and
that, notwithllanding the low flatteries of the Re-
Ja(fteur,_tbe public lÂ»egin to believe, that, although
England may not be very eager to conclude a
peace, the Direftary are more evidently careless
aboat it, notwithstanding the fad lituation of our
finances, and the distress of our marine. Why do
they not fay, that the skill of Lord Malmefbury,
and the ignorance of our,nrÂ£jociator, may equally
concur to obtain credit for this dangerous opinion ?
" It is with regret we are obiged to pufelifli these
relcdlions, the difcloftsre of which is, perhaps,
without some inconvenience. But all pufillani
mons confideratioas â  ought to vanifli before iUt
grand interest of the country ; and fiÂ»ce the Direc

Univ rlally decried, since they are laarcely furrrnin
V>y any other than revolutionary brawlers, who flat

thole who long experience, important ftvices,
tilenti, and wife and reasonable patriotism might
<>e so ufefel to thenp, and spare them many faults
â¢md regrets, it is necessary to convey to them
through the Journals the formidable cry of tha
public opinion and the truth which their flat terers

bringing on their ruin, if to them should one day
be imputed the continuance of the war, and all its
.leeeSary miferies."âJournel de Ptrlcl.
the corrfifpwidcnce it will be fcen that
â¢ur Miaifters hare a&etf with the utmost firranefs
and candor, only, requiring that the enemy (houl i
agree to some fettled print fple of negociation, while
the Directory have constantly equivocated, and ob
stinately forborne either to accede to the pn H Qjpl c
fuggelted ky oitr Court, or to propose any princi
ple of their own, as a fubft'tute.
Lord Malmefbury's mission may now be con
lidertd as drawing to a speedy termination. It ap
pears, by the officii notes winch have " passed be
tween his Lordthip and M. de Lacroix, {irbfeqnent
ly to t!)ofe publilhed in our last, that the Execu
tive DireiSory persist in their determination neither
to recognizethe jail principle of negoeiation pro
posed by his Majefly, nor to offer any other in its
stead, which may serve as a basis on which to nego
tiate a general peace; that is, they refufe to an
fwer this reasonable and necefftiry queftinn at "the
" English Plenipotentiary, " Is the principle of re
" procal cosnpenfitions to be adopted as a basis, or
" rrjefted ? and in cafe of rejeflion, what is to be
" fubftitu,tetÂ« for it ?" After such a refufal, we can
no longer hope for Peace from the present negoeia
tion. The Dire&ory, by their couduft oh this
occasion, have shewn that their temper it as intrac
table as their profeflions are inlincere ; and the
world raufl be convinced from what has passed,
that the Solicitude ps the British Qovernment for
the restoration ps peace has been pushed to a degree
th'at borders on humiliation. The people of France
will not fail to fee the anxiety of Great Britain to
teiminate the effufion of human, blood, and to dif
cever the fangntnary and remoifelefs spirit of their
owa rulers.
Lord has fully answered theqoeftion
of M. de Lacroix, refpefling the dispositions man-
I felled by the Emperor at the commencement of the
present campaign.
Thr State Paper delivered by Baron
the Emprfci's Minister at Basil, to M. Barthele
mi, the French Plenipotentiary there, on the 4th
of June lsfl, appears from the above official corres
pondence, entirely to have escaped the 1 ecolltdtion
of Executive DireAory. This we believe ri>
he the %(S, and the advantage which the tlelivery
of that paper at Basil, and the manner in which it
has been lately introduced hafe given to the British
negotiator, (independent of the sincerity, candour
and spirit ot the British Ministry) seems to Jiiave
irritated and inflamed the minds of the Dire&ory
in a very great degree. The publicity now given
to the delivery ot that paper on the part of the
Emperor, has made a very llrong imprefGÂ«n
upon the minds of the people of France, and their
eager desire for peace, almost upon any terms, is
now mingled with diflruft aad difaffeftion towards
their own Ministers, as being, fiom authentic proofs
the only perfun6 who impede the speedy restoration
of that blessing-
That the disposition of $he people of Fiance for
peace is ardefot and sincere, every thing tends te
prove, and they by no means poflefs that inveterate
hostility to the English which the ephemeral ruler*
df succeeding faftioni have, for their own purposes,
been eager to represent. The Frendi people, worn
out by foreign war and Homeilic despotism, sigh for
the return of peace, of which thry.fpeak a 6 the
rs,-'tuift HiSs; fr.-n,
the peifonal,views of the present rslersin France,
the exilting negociation fail in producing peace, we
shall not be surprised to fee the return of lord
Malmelhtny the immediate source of a foimidabh
infuireiftion, not only in Paris, but in many of the
adjoining departments.

FROM THE LONDON GAZETTE.-
Copy of a letter from Captain Bowen, of his
Majesty's ship the Terpftchore, to Evan Ne
pean, Esq. dated at Gibraltar the of Oc
tober, 1796.
Judging it to be proper that my lords com
miflioners of the admiralty should be acquainted
as loon as possible with the capture of a Spaniih
frigate by his Majesty's ship under my command,
I herewith.inclose you a copy of my letter to the
commander in chief, giving an account of the
action ; and 1 request >ou will be pleased to lay
the fame before their lordships.
of a letter from Capt. Bowen, of his ma
jesty's ship Terpsichore, tÂ» admiral Sir John !
Jarvis, K. B. commander in chief of his majes
ty's ships and veflels in the Mediterranean, da
ted at Gibraltar the 23d of October, 1796.
On the morning of the 13th inft, at day-light,
we discovered a frigate to windward, standing
towards us: about eight I could perceive her
making every preparation for battle, and was
then apparently in tkafe of us. Our situation al
together was iuch as to prevent my being over
deiirous of engaging her. Out of our fmali com
plement of men, we had 30 at the hospital, and
we had more than that number still op board in
our sick convalescent lifts, all of whom were dan
geroully ill or extremely weak. We were scarcely
out of fight of the spot where we knew the Spa
nish fleet to have been cruifmg only two days be
fore ; and, in fa<3, we had flood-on to look for
them, with a view of ascertaining their move
ments. A frtiall Spanifli which we con
jeftured to be a fort of tender, was palling us,
fleering towars so that I could hardly
flatter myfelf with being able to bring the frigate
: off in the event of a victory, or of even escaping
myfelf, if disabled. t)n the other hand, it evi
dently appeared that nothing byt a flight and su
perior failing could enabte me to avoid an ftftion;
and to do tiiat- from a frigate apparently not so
much superior to us, except in point of bulk,
would have been committing the character of one
of his Majesty's ships more than I could bring
myfelf to resolve on. I therefore continued stand
ing without any alteration of course.
Having, wish infinite fatisfaftion and comfort
to myfelfâ commanded the Terpsichore's crew for
two ygars and a half, through a pretty confidera
bie vatiety of services, 1 welj knew the veteran
fluff which I had still left in health to depend up
on for upholding the character of Britifh 1 seamen,
and I felt my mind at e.tfe.as to the termination
of any action with the frigate in fight only.
At half past nine she came within hail, and
hauled her wind on our'weather beam ; and as I
conceived she only Waited to place herfelf to ad
vantage, and to point her guns with exÂ«ttous,
. and being myfelf unwilling to lose tie portion
We were then rn. I ordered one gun to be fired,
as a trier of her intention. It was lb inflantane
oully returned, and followed up by her whdle
broadside, that I am confident they mtftt havfe
done it at the fight of our ftalh. The adtion of
courle"V ent on, and we soon discovered that her
people woul'd not, or could not, refill our fire.
At the end of about an hour and forty minutes,
| during Â« hich time we had twice wore, and em
j ployed about twenty of the last minutes in chafe,
! lhe surrendered. At this period lhe appeared
mod entirely disabled, and we bad drawn up
close alongside, with every gun well charged and
well pointed. It was nevertheless,- with consi
derable difficulty that I prevailed on the Spanilh '
Commander to decline the receiving of such a
broadside by submitting ; aijd from every thing
which I have since learned, the perfonaJ courage,
tonduft, and zeal of that officer, whose name is
Don 1 hamas Ayald, was such during the action,
notwithstanding the eventof it, asrefle&s on him
the greatft honour, and irrefillibly imj-reiTes on
my mind the highell admiration of his character.
After (from the effefls of our fire} all his booms
had tumbled down, and rende ed his waite guns
unserviceable, all the {landing rigging of his low
er mails Ihot away, and I believe nearly every ,
running rope cut thraugh, and a great numbfr i
of his'people kilted and wounded, he llill
vered (though tie could rally but few ofhis men)
he defended his (hip, altnoft lajiger tiiart defence
was jultifiable. Had there been the fnialleft mo
tion in the sea every mail must inevitably have
gone by the board.
Our loss (which will appear by the inclosed
lift) has been less than cauld have been expected;
but our mails, fails, and rigging were found to
be pretty niuch cut up.
Ihe fpinted exertions of every officer, mail
and boy, belonging to the {hip 1 command, as
well in the adtion as in the securing two disabled
{hips, and bringing'them instantly off from a cri
tical fixation by taking the prwe in tow, and by
their incessant labour ever lince, will, 1 trust,
wlien their small number is considered, place
them in a light superior to any praise which I
could bestow. I am even unwilling to speak of
the particular conduct of any of the officers, but
the talents dilplayed by the .First Lieutenant
(Devonlhirej who was but just out of our lick
lift, during the action, added* to his uncommon
fatigue in taking care of the prize, and the very
able manner in whicn he conducted and prepared
to defend her, entitles him to this diftinftion, and
proves him highly deserving of the recommen
dation you gave him, with his appointment in
the Well-Indies. And although I nad rather any
other person (hould observe the conduct of a
brother ot mine in action, and speak of it after
wards, yet I feel it my dutv, as Captain of the
Ihip, to (late, that I thought Mr. Bowen's (the.
Second Leiutenant) conduct was particularly
animating to the {hip's company, and ufeful,
from the number of guns which he saw
well pointed in the course of the action ; added
to which, from the absence of the firft lieutenant
on board the prize, the labouring oar of this lfcip
has fallen on him ; and, in my mind, the talk we
liaTe lwkvl the actiou has been infinitely more
arduous than that of the action it'felf.
I he name of the prize is the Mahonefa, carry
ing on the main deck 26 Spanilh tvvelves, (weigh
ing eighteen ounres more than our's) eight
uiih l:xes on the quarter-deck, and a number of
brass cohoi V ns, fwivelj, &c.; had on board 275
men, besides fix pilots, qualified for the Mediter
ranean as high as Leghorn, and to be put on
board admiral Langara's fleet, which lhe had been'
tent from Carthagena to lop i fÂ»r. She was built
in 1789 at Mahon, is of very large -dimensions,
mealuring 1 ri3 tons and a half Spanilh, was be
fore the action in complete good condition, and
is considered by the Spanilh officers the fafteft
lailor, and one of the bell conllructed, and, what
thâ¬y attach considerable importance to, the hand
somest frigate in their navy.
Both the frigates have this moment anchored

c By, William Gobwin.
THE reputation of this work is already well efta
. blilhed in Europeâlt is hardly necefTary for an Ame
rican editor to fay more than barely to mention, that
'' th c Enqniry concerning Political Justice has' ever
t- since its publication been a favorite performance with
the friends of republican government. The llile is
- pure, nervous, and classical ; the ideas are ftrongl*
marked by an original vein of thinking ; and, amoa'gft
a multitude of other jtift and ftrikiug passages, the
author's delineation of the peculiar infelicities iufepa
" rable from the condition of a King, may be pointed
e out as a moll masterly specimen of philosophical dif
u quifition. The latest London edition of this work

I he gazettes in this country have done it mare real in
jury than all its open enemies ever did or can do. They
mislead the people at home 'and misrepresent them a
broad. It was these vehicles of sedition and discord
that encouraged the counties in the Weft to rebel ; it
was they that gave rife to the depredations of Britain,
by exciting the people to such a<fts of violence againit
that nation, as left no roem to doubt that we were ( de* i
termiiaed on war ; and it was they, when an accom
modation had been happily effected, that'ftirred up art
opposition to it such as has seldom been witnefled, and
which was overcome by mere chance. These gazettes

_ I shall be told that the "peopW are to blame; that
tney are not obliged to read these abominabfc publica

read them, read nothing else. To suppress them is Im
pofiible; they will vomit forth'fhcir poison ; it is a pri

therefore the only mode left is, to countered its effeflj.
This must be done, too, in theirownferay. Books,

and when the detection at last makes its appearance, it
is often as nfelefs as that of the do<sVor who finds his

is to meet them on their own grouiid ; to set foot to
