[Prom poems by S. T. COLEP.IDGE/J
ONCE mort, sweet stream ! with flow foot wand'ring
near,
I bless tny milky waters cold and clear.
Efcap'd the fladiing of the noontide hoi:Â«
With one frelh garland of Pierian flowers,
(Ere from thy zephyr-haunted brink I turn)
My languid hand Ihall wreath thy molTy urn.
For not thro* pathless grove with murmur rude
Thos footheft the fad wood-nymph, solitude
Nor thine'unfeen in cavern depths to well.
The HFRMIT-FOUNTAIN of fomc dripping celj!
' Pride of the Vale ! thy ufeful dreams fuppiy
| The fcatter'd cots and peaceful hamlet mgh.
The elfin tribe around thy friendly batiks
With infant uproar and loul-footbmg prank',
Releas'd from frhool,their little hearts at reft.
Launch paper navies on thy wavelefs breast.
The ruflic here at eve with pensive look
Whittling lorn ditties leans upon his crook,
Or starting pauses with hope-minglsd dread,
; To lift the much-lov'd maid's accudom'4-tread,
: She, vainly mindful of her dame's command,
â¢ if.oiters, the long-fill'd pitcher in her hand.
Unboaftftil stream ! Thy fdÃnt with pebMcd falls
The faded form of past delight recalls,
What time the morning fun of Hope arofs,
And all was joy ; five when another's woes,
A tranlient gloom upon my foul imprest,
Like paiTuig clouds impiilured on thy breast.
Life's current then ran sparkling to the noon
Or filv'ry stole beneath the pe#five Moon.
Ah ! now it works rude-brakes and thorns aiflong)
Or o'er the rough rock bursts aad foams along !
From the Aurora.
To the Ele&ors ai the City of Philadelphia
Fellow-citizens,
WHEN we consider (he high interest that we
all took in the important queltion' lately decided in
our national Lcgifliture, there feemt no ooubt ttul,
ir the ensuing eleftioH, your attention will be at
traCted in a conliderable degree tov/ards the differ
ent candidates for that station, and to the forming
of our choice.
This confcquence, which is natural, is also very
desirable j because the more ardently we enter tipon
the fubjeÂ£t, the more likely arc we to choose' with
propriety, as the interest we take in the fubjed
will sharpen our difccrnraent in investigating the
ebavaftert that we propose to represent us. There
is, however, reason to apprehend that this zeal
(which when moderate i? beneficial} will be ren
-1 dered injurious by cxcefs, and instead of promoting
indu.trious researches. will serve only to bias the
public judgment. I would therefore caution yop,
my fellow-citizens, to free yourselves from all party
prejudices, and to avoid thole men who come in a
pressing mariner to solicit youi fuffrages, becaufc
it is probable that their a&ivity in the matter*pro
ceeds from, the fame influence. Let your votes o
riginate with yourselves, and let them be the result
of your own cool refle&jon. Examine with can
dour into the abilities and integrity of a sandidate,
and decide for him on whose li-de you find the ba
lance of these rcquiflte qmlitwÂ«, without
to listen to the intrigues Â»f corruption, or the fo
licitatjdns of ignorance.
For my part, I cotifefs, I cannot help fufpediing
â  these who evince such auxietv to direst the judg
' msnts of their neighbours, of less worthy views
! than those of zeal for the public good; that adting
themselves from interested motives, they endeavor
to ingratiate themselves still more with their favor
> ite, by converting others to his interest.
' Let us, however, for the fake of charity, flip.
| pose that they aÂ£t from principle. Is it not the
1 height of arrogaocc for them to qndeavour to bia3
the minds of other men, and substitute their own
Â» opinions for ours ? What is it but to fay that we
' aredellitute of penetration to fee the interest of
our country, and that they wi(h to fuppiy our de
) ficiency by their own' inftrudtion ?
It is not intended here to recommend any parti
cular man to the notice of the public. I should coufi
der such a recommendation as impertinent, because
we all know the candidates, and know their cha
radlers. All 1 would wifti is, that the decilion of
1 eirery iadividual, to whatever fide it inclines, mqy.
be fiee, and not dependant on the will of others.

It is with a mixture of pleasure and regret, that
we present to our reader* the PRESIDEN T's
ADDRESS, contained in thiÂ» day's paper:âof
pleasure, because we elleera it, an invaluable legacy
to the l'eop'e of these States tâof regret (a tclfiih
one we e<mfclVJ~~fcrcgaulc it announces his departure
from the political helm.
If fuperflitioH hallows every relic of a pretended
faint; âif fenfibilily so richly prizes every memorial
of a beloved friend ; âhow highly should the citi
zens of America venerate this teftimoi ial of affec
tion from the BRIGHTEST MIRROR OF
DEITY that ever exiiled, even though it were
possessed of no intrinsic merit! But tfte heart,
warm and enthusiastic, often fondly invents a mi
crofgope to view the loveliness of afavored ofcjeft ;
and, deceivtd by partiality, is enraptured by things
that are frivolous, perhaps despicable. It is not
so in the present cafe ; for the undtrjiimdmg is con
vinced equally with the heart, arid the glad tribune
of applaufeis cheerfully prtffered by them both.
This address relembles the fond advice of a dy
ing parent to his beloved children :âLike that, it
breathes the warmth of affcÂ£hon, and an anxious
folicitudc for their future welfare:âLike that, let
it never be effaced from our remembrance, let it
deeply impTcfs our mftids, and be worn in the cen
tre of our hearts.
And when its illustrious author (hall retire to par
take of the enjoyments of private lifeâlong, long
may he live, enjoying all that happiness which he
deserve* ! May he cWerriuliy psft through the even
ing of his days, blessed by the God whom he wor
ships, esteemed by the people whom he has render
ed happy, loved by the wife whom he eherifhes,
'at peace with hirnfelf, and neither fearing nor wilh
ing for death : whilit his philanthropic achieve
ments throng around him, like minillrant-cherubs,
Tinging their requiem to his declining years! ,
r May he live
Longer than 1 huve time to tell his years!
Ever belov'd and loving may his life be !
And when old time ihail lead him to his end,
Goodness and he fill up one monument!

FRIDAY EVENING, SEPTEMBER 30, 1796.
Died, in this city, on Saturday the 17th .in
stant, 'after a (hort illness, Mr. Richard Coch
ran, Merchant. He was a 'young gentleman,
defcrvedly refpe&cd by a numerous, and refpe&a
ble acquaintance. And the next day his remains
were interred in the Prclbyierian bsirial ground,
in Lower Merion township, Montgomery county,
attended by * Vtft concourse of rcfpeflable citi
zens, ot deferent denominations.

Wafoington, 26th Sept. 1796, to a person in this
J&y-
this moment the alarm of fire is cried. A
tremenduous fire has broke out in George-town,
and lias consumed ten houfea, all of them frame
Messrs. George and Adam KiÂ»g are the principal
fufferers ; Mr. J. Forrelt has loft two or three hou
les ; Doctor Magtuder has fuffered by the removal
of his dAgs, &c. His bouse was torn down with
two others, which was the means of the fire being
ftopt, with the help of the engine. The fire broke
out ih one of Mr. Kings houfss, but cannot find
ont the particulars ; it is said to be the negledt of a
servant of Mr. King, who was ordered on Satur
day, to have his mailers horse ready by day light,
for Mr. King to go to Baltimore, and left the can
dle in the ftabliâthis is one of the reports, there
art others, but it is hard to tell which is true.â
Five of the houses were occupied as dry and wet
good ftorcs ; all the goods have been laved. No
lives loft, nor any pt ifon hurt."

France possesses ;:t this moment only three colo
nies in the Well-Indies. Cayenne, which was
oever reckoned as any thing in the commercial
scale. Gvadaloupe, which hardly supports it
felfâ- the produce of which does not amount to one
quarter part of what it did before the war, since
France gets nothing, and the United States very
little.
St. Domingo is divided betwoen.the French
and the Englilh. The latter pofl'efs that part for
merly called Grr.nde Anfe, comprehending I rait,
Alrieots, Cafe Dame Marie, 'Jeremit and Layemites.
They have also Fort au-Prince, la Croix de Bou
quets, le Mireba'.ais, I'Archahaye, St. Marc, and
the Mule-, that is, in all ten There re
mnins then to the French forty seven or forty.eight.
In this number ate the parishes of the north pav
of the iAind, which, before the revolution, were
the riclitft and mail opulent of the colony.
The quarters which are in the hands ofthe Eng
li!h, produce four times as much as tliofe which
pertain to the French.â [The paper then proceeds
to aftign the reafor.s for-this differenceâThe prin
cipal one is, that in the places possessed by the Kng-
Ji(h> or those under their command, the negroes
work. In thole possessed by the French, the mu
lattoes have the afccndancy, and there the negiors
will not workj but pillage, burn and deftroy.J

We have For some time p ft tflened, tliat a mis- m
umlerfiaiding existed between this countty and F
Spain, and that the Executive Dire&ory were ex- ct
erting all their influence upon the Spanilh govern- tl
ment, for the purpose of inducing it to declare war tc
againil this country. The following was publilhed h:
this moaning as a p]
MANIFESTO FROM THE COURT OF SPAIN,
Which the Marquis de lis Cafas, AmbafTador of tt
his Catholic Majesty at our Court, has, it is said, p
by the dire&ioti of his court, presented to Lord h;
Grenville. Whether the manifefio is or is notau- vv
thentic, we have not yet been able to ascertain. It c ,
jc in fubllanceas followsâ
" The Spanish cabinet retraces the origin of the F
coalition, and mentions the principal circumflances, fr
as well as the different events, in which both nab
tions took an active part, during their alliance, a- p
gainst the French Republic. This statement is ft
followed by an account of several tranfaftions
which have taken place before and since the feccf
fion of Spain from the coalition, and the treaty of
peace concluded with France, as, a
Firll. The St. JagQ prize (hip, which the note c
contends to have been condemned in open contempt li
of subsisting treaties and legal lorms. w
Secondly. Divers circumstances which attended n
the capture and evacuation of Toulon, on which {
occasion the Spanish cabinet aflerts, that the Bri- J 1
tifh commandets fulfilled none of the terms granted a
to the inhabitants under the of the Spa h
nifh commanders ; and that they carried off feve- si
ral French (hip 3, without allowing the Spaniards tl
any part of the prizes. I
Thirdly. The embargo laid in our ports on t
wood for ship-building, bought up in the north of v
Europe on account of the Spanish government, t
which was left rotting either or board the (hips, o
or in ware-houses, where it could not be taken care p
$f.
.(Fourthly. The embargo laid on the fire-arms a
purchased iii England on Spanish account, and with C
the contest of our government, after the French g
had got pofleflionof tbc Spanish foundcries, which
fire arms were obligÂ«rd to be re-fold by the Spanish
agents at a considerable loss.
Fifthly. The insult offered to his Catholic Ma- '
jefty, in the person of the Marquis de las Cafas, his r
AmbafTador, vyhen he had his firft audience with '
Lord Grenville. 1
Sixthlyi The seizure of the silks sent to this 1
country by Spanish merchants, which they had
bought up at their own account at the sale of the
piiies made by admiral Richer)', and which they
had sent to England conformable to the laws of Â£
Great-Britain. 1
Seventhly. That the floppage of several Spa
nish vefiels, the vexatious proceedings daily excr- '
eifed against them by the commanders of the fqua
irons of his Britannic Majesty, as well in the Me
â¢litertean as in the other seas." 1
A war with Spain will, we should suppose, be '
â¢:onfidered as a moil calamitous event to this coun
ryâ by every person in it. The time was, when c
- the idea of a Spanish war diffufed almost general '
atisfaftion } but the sentiments of the nation are '
juw, ni believe, changed ; and the people bcgi.i 1
,-0 be conyinced, that galleons and remitter ships, '
lowevcr rich their cargoes may be, affotd but a 1
I joor compensation to the country for the additional ]
axes and burthens, which are thefure and perma- '
tent effects of wat.
August 4,
Â£(tjp The above cotitradiSed.'J
The manifefio, which was publilhed in a mini-
Aerial paper yesterday morning, we gave without
â¢my comment on its authenticity. We have since
'earnt that no such manifefio has been presented to
he king's ministers, k this the miniflerial paper it
ell confeffcs; though the fame paper also states
hat " they are persuaded, after the most minute
nqtiiry, that such complaints as they have alleged,
ave been forwarded by the court of Madrid to its
mbaflador in London." Now it certainly will be
â â¢ith every one a natural fufejeA of enquiry, why
he court of Madrid or its ambassador, thought
.roper to communicate a document of such import
nre to the Editor, of a newspaper, before they
r wade it known to hismajefly's miniflers?âSuch a
ciode*of conduct would in the Spanish ambassador
e a flagrant violation of duty. Besides the docu
â¢' ICHLt- f. If In nlnnnfilyâ Irp fuljjujjlll of
< >mplaints are weakly handled, and the whole ap
, ears to us to be a forgery, which cannot lay claim
?cn to the merit of ingenuity.
Not that we mean to give it as our opinion that
lereexifts no difference between this country

priells replied, that they were Sot made under their

have had the liberty of going tÂ® visit the fanflua
