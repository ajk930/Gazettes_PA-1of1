to the OftitirÂ» and Soldiers of the late Continental
Army, by the produ&ion of forged iÂ«flrumtÂ»ts,
To check in future such impoGtipns, it has been
thought advifeable ; that all persons, having claims
for bounty land", whether in their own rijjht, as
legal rcprefentative, or by virtue of any instrument
or deed of transfer, be required to forward their
refpe&ive claims to the War Oific*, on or .before
the firft day of January 1799 in order that such
claims may be duly examined, adjusted and deter*
mined upon.
To fubdantiate foch claims, a striA ibfervance of
the rules heretofore ifllied frcra the War Office will
be indispensable ; and in addition to what is requir
ed by the laid rules, the certificate of the vknow
ledgement of a Deed or Power of Attorney, mult
also set forth the place of residence and occupation
of the claimant or person making ftich acknowledg
ment ; and when the pioof of perluoal knowledge
is by a witnfcf" or witnefle*, their place or places of

( CatUiuuilion of the Debate m rtoMttiig fur
ther approprialttus for the Frigala.)
Mr. Livingfton said, he was one of those
who had constantly voted for such a navy,
as he thought the proteftion ef the com
mercc of the country required, the nati
on coni'l afford; tut the continual difap
pomtment which he had experienced on this
score, end the excefiivc expenee which had
Aeeti incurred, had considerably lessened his
zeal. The question was, whether the com
mittee would, iww make an appropriation on
account, or wait until they reeeived an esti
mate from the proper department, and be
lieving, as he did, that the balance of the
last appropriation risv in hand, was fuffici
ent for any immediate demand, he should be
in favour of the committee's rising. Indeed
he believed the fatility with which the house
had gone into appropriations of this kind,
had .encouraged tb? lavish expenditure of the
money ; and, after the committee (hall have
risen, if no other member did it, he should
propose the appointment of a committee to
enqufre into the expenditure money
which had beta.appropriated objeft.
How the mopeyhad beeo appropriated was
a secret to that house, but it was a secret
which oerght ro be laid open. Great oblo
quy had been tfrrown upon the persons thro'
whose this money had paTTed ; if they
were not defervingof it, tbe obloquy ought
to be removed ; if it were deserved, it ought
to be fixed. He believed, if it were seen
that this money would not be appropriated,
until th&eftimate in qtieftion was reCeived>
the house woiili{t not be lopg without if.
Mr. to hear the
last up, speak of the facility with which ra Â»ney had
b:en vr>tÂ«d for tb%
wljo Had beeri wiuKfla* to the manner i.i which the
appropriation* for this objeft had beÂ«n made, would
not fay they bscn r w&h sac# r uy. He had
only been present arorfeot these qiieftio/is, but he
knew of no qucftton which had been treated as th-Â»
JvÂ»d. A *6te passed ibe ather without de
,bi e, on account of tfccmiltury
rite with the house, inprelercnce to thenavpl eftablfh
mcnt, he could ndr tell Facility in granting ihit
money might, upon the peiitjtman*! doÂ£lnne, bean
â¢ inducement to-unnect ffary expenlc in tjÃ.c military
ettsbltfhrhent. Indeed, ih order to prevent a lavish
fxpenfc of money, ir would be ntcefFary to go into a
uarrr> Jpftate
carr>e tefor clonic. Mr. S. bebeved this appro- I
priaam ft'iod 'inrn 'he fame ground with that fifthÂ©
militarv eTtwbiiftunent. The Sccictaiy of the Trea-
had commanded bntfi, biit had given no efti

ney hitlvwMXNpcndfd upon the they
â â¢were to be tb'owaaway, or bu nt ? if their argu
ment mea<tt any tUingÂ» U nxaant thart. He would
take t for granted, that, upon an examination of the
accounts, the money had h*en impioperly expended
thai tbe officers h*3 d**' l unfairlyâthft the mo
rtev h*d been thro *n into the fca ( s the gentleman
Irom Virginia was pleated to suppose) he cid not
fuppoie, that even in this cafe, gert-lcmcn would w.ilh
all that had been expended'to be thrown away. Gen

lofsby the worlt lliH, from a refusal of the
workmertlo labour wilho'it pay ? But, if the money
were jppÂ»opriiled, it wguld rrmain in the trealury if
it were not wanted, therefore no injury could arise to
the United Statesfton the appropria ion; but carifi
dcrable lofj raiflht be fnfta iied by the want of mo"cy
to carry on the wo Ik. Mr. S concluded try faying
be considered a navÂ»f Homimt as necessary to the
digni'v and najrorul charter <.f :be United States
He wifbed, theicfore, thatevery neetffary appropria
tion should be made, at the lame time Chat an enqui

waÂ» hiui Itow so much meney could
have bun .xpended IB thiÂ»t>ufinefs, and fo many
Â«rior> could nave been made in <he ettimaiea which
had from time 10 timabeen made, but, when it was
considered thÂ»i the buffneU of building armed veflela
of lhi*kind was whslly new to us, and that, the pri
ce! of the various articles made life 'of, had greatly
augmented, u was not so strange that mitlakes had oc
curred. But whaiever these liÂ«ve been, or
whatever blanje tniv have teen ircurred. as it was
still necefTaeylb r impleie-I'iÂ» /wW, hetruited the ap.
propriauon be agreed t)^,
Mi - Nicholas said, gentlemen seemed to
take it for gianted, tlmt the wlie
the frigates should be finifhtd, was before
the committee. For the fake of the frigates
he thought they ought not so to eonfidcr it.
If the committee were fatisfied, from expe
rience, that this bufinefÃ had been carried on â 
at an enormous experice, was it not necessa
ry to look into the bufuiefs .' Were Con
gress to support tbe dignity of the country
by gJviug away the jÂ»ebple's moneyânot
perhaps for their use, but for some other
purpose. E-vfry man nuill be aftoniHied at
the expenee, which had been incurred, and 1
was it rot proper to enqnire how this had â¢
happened ? Gentlercltn fay, if # the money
were not wanted, it would fie in the Treasu
ry, and no difadvgntage would be fuftaihed.
But this was as much aÂ« to fay, that every
thing should be giveu which was asked for '
by any of the departments. If
all concuring in the fame objeft of finifhing
the frigates, the mode proposed would be
fhnrteft. 0 '
The gentleman from New-York was right
v.4ien lit fail! the money for this objeft had
been granted with facility ; for though there
had teen a cunteft about the ufefulnef* of
thtefrigates, there had been none about the
estimates thimfelves. If the house had been
toUJ, last winter that 600,000 dollars had
been wauting to complete the frigatei, in-
Aead of 200,000, he believed it would have
aftonilhed every one, and an enquiry would
have beeti instituted into this business ; but
this had not been3one, the house had been
drawn on frbttr time to time, and from time
to time deceived in the business ; for all that
had btcrt said about inexperience, high prietv
of "articles, kc. had no weight. Mr. N-.
concluded by declaring be was not aftiug at
an encmyiof tbe Frigates, but as a Friend
fifth Pullic. whose money, in this instance,
had been ftjuandered beyond all example,.
Mr. Rutledge (aid, tlie leafon given by
Gentlemeu for postponing this bulinefs
that tbe appropriation already tmi<fe had
been enormous : but he would ask them ore
queftionâJjnppofe the m<juey UerLtofort ?p
propriated had been mifpent, would tlieyN
now refufmtq appropriate a furiher sum ?
AH thit w?.s wanted, be f<i"jl> to complete
the frigates, teis 36,000 doliars, and only
Zo,oo3\vere tlow asked for. But gentle
men fay no, we will iirll iiiftitute an encjiii
ry into .the expenditure of the m<>ney alrea
dy appropriiterl He had no objeftion to
this enquiry, bu\ he would in the wean time"
appropriate the Aioney.
Mr. J. Williams replied to the enquiry
of the gentleman jiift fat down, that though
pad sums had been he would eon
fent to appropriate mrtfe, but not to be spent
in tie fame ivoy. Mr. YV. went over the va
rious sums which had been from time*tÂ» time
called for, and concludei,by faying that he
would not co:rfent to vote for more, until he
saw how' what had been appropriated }iad
been expended, or except he knew thebu
â¢ (1 <n-fs vras at a stand for want vf money.
Mr. Sewall K-ad the letter of the Secre
tary of the Treafnry, wherein he fays an
appropriation on account of Naval de
partment will be neccflary.
Mr. Gallatin said, when lie was up be*
fore, he had stated that it had never been
the praftice of the House to grant money
unless an estimate was laid before them to
(hew that it was necefTary. This had been*
called a quibble by one gentleman, and ano
ther had quoted an instance wherein the house
had a&ed differently. But the gentleman
from "Massachusetts (Mr. Sewall) was mil-'
taken in this refpeft. It was true that the
Secretary of the Treasury did ask for an
appropriation for the defipiences in the Mil
itary establishment ; but it was not true that
the house granted them. The house had
agreed to an appropriation.' For what ?â â
For the deficiences ? No. They hare a
greed for an appropriation towards the ex
pencesfor 1798,*f0r which they have efti
matcs before them. Until the Secretary of
the Treasury laid an eftimatc before the
house, except the nseefiity was very urgent
indeed (which he did not believe â¢Â« the pre
sent cafe it was) he fliould dÂ«cline any ap
propiiatioo. As an individual, he was rea
dy to acknowledge, he was against btvilding
the frigate* ; but did gentlemen suppose
that he was weak enough to believe that
by making an opposition to a partial appro
priation, he could defeat the objeft, against
a large majority of the house? No. H<*
believed theie would be a very confiderablt
majority ready to vote for any sum which
might be wanted for the frigates, though
he might vote differently. But he thought
there was another objeft worth contending
for, which was, not to vote money because
a department calls for it, however much
that officer may be entitled to the confidence
of the house. If this practice were gone in
to, it would create endhrfs roifchief. Mr.G.
said, the different conclusions which gentle
men had drawn on the fubjeft, were fuffici-.
ent to (hew that the committee were not pre
pared to come to a vote on the fubjeft, as
one declared that 130,000 dol
lars were wanting to complete the frigates,
and another infilled that only were
necessary ! F or his part be did not know,
hut fauaJwk-Â»*â Â»* n r {, l c ~
â  ~ r *<*xrrai-l, that any money at all was want
ing for that purpose. When the eftimatfe
was laid before the house, he should not ob
jeft to a partial appropriation before the en
quiry was gone into; but at present he
eould not consent to it.
Mr. Harper said, as several gentlemen,
had expressed their intentipn of voting
for this appropriation, when the eftiroates
should be laid before the though nÂ«w
.they objefted to it, and as jio great inconve
nience, he trusted, would arise from the de
lay of three or four days, he wotfftl jgin in
voting for the committee to rife
Mr. Sewall produced a ftatiemeut of the
Secretary of lately made to the house,
wherein he states that there is a deficiency of
35,000 dollars.for the completion of the fri
gates. He thought this fufficient ground
for the appropriation, and regretted' that
the gentleman from S. Carolina had conclude,
ed to vote f<yflthe committee's riling. Mr.
S. referred to,what had fallen from Mr.'G.
and said the oaly difference between the
two eafe6 of naval and military eftablifkment
was, that we did not build frigates by the
year.
Mr. Pinckney said, if he thought voting
for this appropriation, would preclude an
enquiry into past expenditures, and by that
means to put the business upon a better foot
ing in future, he should by no means vote
fÂ»r it. But he did not believe tl*is.' How
'cver, if gentlemen wished the business to lie"
over for two or three days, he had no ob
jfftion ; but if it were their intention to
postpone an appropriation nntil an eaquiry
into former expenees was gone into, he
should have serious objeftions to it. It had
been admitted on all hands that the frigates
had been an expensive business ; but a fur
ther delay would make them more so. He
thought the Treasury might be fafely trust
ed with this money, and the enquiry could
in the mean time, be going on.
The question for the committee to rife,
was jjut and carried 45 to 35.
A message was received from the Senate,
informing the Jhoufe, that they had passed
the bills for the relief of the representatives
of William Carmichael, for the partial ap
propriations for the year'l79B, for autho
ring the pa ment of a fnm of money to the
daughters of the late Count de GrafTe, and
for the payment ofiitereft on a certificate
due to General Kolciufkiaâthe latter with
an amendment. '
Mr. Cochran proposed the following re
falutiou :
" Resolved, that the committee' oFVom.
merce and manufaftures be direfted to en
quire into the propriety of allowing 4 draw,
back on g<?od< exported to the Britifc pro
vinces in Canada by way of the Lakes, and
tepftft, tktir'opinion thereon." Autf Mr.

agreed to and a committee appointed.
Mr. Gregg asked leave of absence for
his colleague Mr. Hartley for ten days, that
crentleman having received information after
tHe house rose on Friday l ift, which called
him home.
This leave was granted ; but not with
out some general obfervatioas from Messrs.
Thatcher and J. Williams on the impropri
ety of the pr?ftice of asking leave in this
manner, after gentlemen had been absent
several days from their duty, which was an
evasion of the rule of the house, " that no
%iembcr frail absent himfelf from the duties
of the hwff, without leave," and which
pivlonged the absence of gentlemen beyond
the leave obtained.
Mr- Cochrap alked aod obtained leave of
absence for a week.
MV. Macon, from the committee of re
vifal and unfinifhed business, moved that

a number of citizens and freeholders of the
counties of Southampton, Sussex and Prince
George, in Virginia, praying a repeal of
the stamp :ift, and for certain alterations in
the law laying a duty on spirits and on stills.
Mr. H. observed that as the house had
anticipated the wishes of his constituents,
in relation to the spirit tax, by the bill
which had lately pafftd, there would be an
impropriety iii referring that part of the pe
tition ; but so much of it as related to the
ftann p aft, he moved to refer to the commit--
tee ot ways and means.âAgreed.
Mr. Cloptom, from the committee of en
rolment, repdrted the following bills as du

Mr. Evansfaid, that the attorney-gener

thji postage. of packets and letters which
ty ( i his had been particularly felt inthe
packets and letters which he had received
in (relation to the 6th article of the Britifti
treaty, which had amounted to several hun
dred dollars. To relieve this officer from
thus inconvenience, Mr. E. proposed a reso
lution to the following effeft.:
Resolved, that all the letters and pack
ets to or from the attorney-general of the !
United iliall be conveyed, free of j
postage, under like reftriftions with letters
or packet* palling to and fronT the other

Agreed to be referred to the committee
on poft-offices and post-roads.
The amendment of tlje senate to the bill
.authorizing the payment of interest on a
certificate due to gen. Kofciuiko, was tak
en up. This amendment went to strike out
that part of - the interest which had been di

Amsterdam to Leipfic or Dr,efden. , After
some dircuffion, this amendment was disa

Mr. Dwight Foster, from the committee

a committee of the whole on the bill for the
relief of certaSn reprefentatires of certain de
ceased officers and soldiers, Mr. Dent in
the ehaii 1 , whWh, after considerable difcuf
fioa, which chiefly turned upon the prapri
ety'or impropriety of changing the period
whi<& had heretofore been considered as ter
minating the war, in the cowrie of which
different periods were proposed, was agreed
to with one amendment, determining tbat
such officers and soldiers as live&till the 24th
of March 1793, be entitled to the
fame allowance as if they had lived till the
3d of November, in the fame year (the time
at which Cortgrefs disbanded the army.)â
The committee rose, and the house concur

third reading, it was negatived, there be

j from a statement which he read, would bring
i hit allowance to the fame amount which liad

i from commencement of the year 1794* s
i motion was opposed on the ground that- â 
four dollars a day (which was the allowance
. made by law) during his attendance upon
' duty, was lufliciVnt pay for the sergeant at
j arms ; that the door-keeper's allowance was
I a salary of 500 dollars per anrfum, for an
: annual attendance, to which, on of
extraordinary ftrvices, or from the aear
nefs of living, some temporary grants had
been made, the chief of which (and which
principally produced tlie difference spoken
of) was 250 dollars allowed to the present
door-keeper in 1794, when assistant to Mr.
Dally, on account of his having done neatly
the whole of the duty during that session.
The amendment was on one hand urged as
an improper tack to the bill frÂ«m the Senate
and on the other, it was advocated I as ne
ceflary to put an end to what was thought
to be an improper practice, viz. the grant, '

RBfIEH? OF THE LATE NEWS FIOM EUROPE.
France, having coucluded a peace with-
Austria, and according to the most recent
lion-official intelligence, finally adjusted
terms with Portugal, has tow no employ
011 the continent for her soldiers. Insular
â England, only remains in hostility with her.
Mistress of the sea more unequivocally than
France is of the land, it is, at length, tho'
reluftantly, yielded to her by all-tiie pow
ers, with'whom {he has been contending.
The Republjc of France has dismantled,
either from this motive or necessity, hervaif-
Jeaux de lignc. Batavia has experienced a
defeat which has greatly lessened her mari
time power, and paralysed exertions, which
if aftive, would be years in recreating the
vessels they have loft. The monarchy of
Spain, naturally imbecile, though {he pef
feffes a large navy, yet, being sensible (lie
can only find disgrace upon the ocean, pru
dently keeps them in her ports : though the
absence of the late inferior blockading squad
ron, seems politely to offer to admiral Maf
ferado, an opportunity of enjoying the
wholesome falt-witer air, he yet seems to
dread a ' L ion' or rather a Leviathan " in
the way," and reposes himfelf in the inte
rior harbor of Cadiz...
preTled state of the. marine of hferftlf and
allies, having no service for her armies, and
probably dreading their sudden ' difband
ment, avowedly contemplates an invaiion of
England. In what manner this is to be
attempted, we cannot, to our fatisfaftion,
conjecture ;,if it is thought, a fufficient
number of veffelscan be collefted, tho' of a
i small foice, to transport over the soldiers
j for this purpose, and that ingenuity may
preveift the Engllih from suspeCting or as
certaining feafofiably the moment of their
failing, that they may not be ready to in
tercept their passage, we think the direfto
| ry wrongly eflimates the vigilance of the
j Britilh naval commanders, and reflects net
! on the numerous fry of cutters which the
Englifli have. If it is expefted that from
the Mediterranean, Spain, and Holland,
with the equipment of their own fleets, they
(hall be able to fcrrm an armada superior to
any naval force the Englifli can oppose to them
taking- experience into view, we conceive
they will be disappointed. The power
whose separate fqnadroas defeat or defy
the scattered fleets of the allies, will, col
leftivcly, be proportionately superior, and
probably fuccefsful.
If the threatened inyafion is not merely
made to terrify the Englilh into their terms
(which we fufpeft) an army larger than a
ny since thÂ» days of Xerxes, will probably
be collefted for the purposeâOn their cros
sing the channel every exertion will un
doubtedly be made to (lop them ; if they
evantually land, their reception will be warm
âThe blood of the ancient Albions still
remains in fufficient purity to urge the pre
sent Britons to the most desperate confliCl
to repel the invaders, and protest their
wi*es, their offspring, and their property.
Whatever may be the issue of the expedi
tion, the {laughter of human beings must
be terribleâit cannot reafonabiy be com
puted at less than one hundred thousand !
If Great Britain is subjugated (though
common sense wjll blame us for thus appar
ently admitting the possibility) the conse
quences, the changes in the world, a.e in
calculable. In attempting to trace them
by reflection, we are completely loft, as he
who endeavors to explore the mysteries of
divinity. We believe, ere England is con
quered by France
"Dover's cliffs from Calais rent,"
Must be again united. ( Majf.Merc.")
LONDON, Oftober 15.
Admiral de Winter fays, that he was
forced out by the French party, against his
own judgment ; for knowing the very bad
state of his (hips, and the iudifpofition of
several of the crews, to the cause, he knew
that he was not a match for the EnglilH
squadron. His orders were, however, to
fight them, if they met ; and he had no
deftinat'.on appointed to him in his Cruize.
He haS merely orders to ciuize between the j
two coasts ; and, as he had been threaten- j
â¢ tned with a Court Martial for having m?dc
some objcflion to failing;, he dil, not doubt
he <hoi,ld have been Condemned, hid he re

executed. There was not a on

The number of guns on the fide of the

the frigates and (loops, of which the two
frigates, the Beaulieu and the Circe, carry

Reflections on Monroe's "View."
No. VIII.
Upon reading the preceding letters, every one
naufl be struck with ihe omtiaft which they pre
sent. li the indifcretion,if the abjeil condcfcen
fion, 'if the zeal of M*. Monroe to fervc the
French republic on this occasion, excite painful
" fenfatioas in the breast of every true American,
the prudence, the independence of spirit, andthe
genuine patriotism which diftinguifli Mr. Jay,
:i> ought to be a fouree of heartfelt pleasure.
f. Our minister at Paris having inil'reprefented
. , the miflioa to London, it wai improbable, if not
impolHble, that any treaty Great-
Britain, -would not have been the fubjefl of
" complaints on the part of France. So hostile
wai France'to Great-Britain, that it would have
objefted treaty whatever, and therefore
* those who wilhed to defeat any and every trea
â¢ ty, would <,mleaveur to do so anterior to its rat
ification. With this view, the committee of
public fifety were anxious to poflili a copy of
the treaty which was reported to have been ne
gotiated, anil they requested Mr. Monroe to
furnifti tliern with the treJty itfelf as fooi as
pofiible, declaring that it <was the only means
that ivmid fatisfy them concerning it. Wfcat
.right had the committee to make this request?
and why was it made in terms so full of inso
lence ? The forms of our constitution are well
known iu France, and consequently, they knew
that the treaty hid not been ratified when they
desired a copy, and it was for the purpose of en
abling them to interfere with effect in our na
tional eontradls, that the demand was. made.
But they are not alhame'd to accompany this un
warrantable request, with a declaration that a
fight of the treaty alone luould fatisfy them ; in
plainer words, that they would not believe any
thing that Monroe our minister fliould tell them
en the fubjeft. That Mr. Monroe lhould he
insensible to any insults offered to his country by
France i or that he fnould yield to its demands
however improper, they who know his blind
and fanatie il attachments will fupp'ofe poflible:
But had he no feeling for hii Own honor, for his
own reputation, when he was told by the com
mittee, and in writing too, that nothing but
the treaty itfelf would fatisfy them, or in other
words, they should not believe any thing Jic
ibould fay concerning it ! To this demand, en
croaching en our rights of forereignty, and ex
pressed in terms the raoft contemptuous, was no
â¢ other answer tejbe given.than that he( Mr.Mon
roe) was then ignorant of the particular ftipu
htions of the treaty, but he begged leave to aj
ure them, he would communicate the fame to
them as soon as he lhould be informed ? He
ought to have told the committee with manly
candour, that the treaty eou'd not be communi
cated in its present uufinifhed state to the councils
of any foreign nation j and he might have re
peated what by order of his government he had
before told them, that so stipulation would be
made inconsistent with the prior engagements
of the United States to foreign nations ; and
he might have informed them on the authority
of our envoy, that no futh stipulations had beeii
made.
The ex-minister was not fatisfied with giv
ing this evidence of his tame, mean-spirited de
portment towards the committee : He went fur
ther, and made an eflurt "ty .L.:-
insolent and ill-iritefntidned request, by Tending a
special messenger to London for the treaty, even
although he was informed by Mr. Jay, that it
was improper to publilh the treaty without ihe
express leave of government before it was rati--
fied, and was offered a copy of the treaty in per*
feft confidence only In his letter he tells Mr.
Jay, that he had promised to communicate the
treaty to the committee, who Â«j allies thought
they were entitled to it, and said nothing lei's
would fatisfy them ; for which purpose he had
sent for it ; and when this wife and steady
itatefman abfoluttlv refufed him a copy, for the 1
very reason jhÂ»t induced the ex-minilt'er to fend
for it, the refufal Is taken sorely at heartland is
the fubjeft of various and Wonlifterit com
plaints to the Secretary of State. At one time,
he laments that he was not pofTeffed of infor
mation that might be ufeful to our affairs in
France; and in the fame letter, dated 17th
March 1795, fays, if the communication had
been made to him, he lhould have declared that
on his own knowledge the treaty did not inter
fere with the prior engagements, but that being
a mere projefl, fubje<2 to rt-jetfioii &c. it ought
not to be publifhetl; and that this declaration
would hive been fatisfaflory to the committeeâ
(page 142). To Mr. Jay, however, when he
applied for ,the treaty, he said that nothing ltfs
than the treaty itfelf would fatisfy the commit
tee ; that he had promised it to them, and had
sent for it for their ufc ; and he even added, that
as allies they thought they had a right to it.â
Under these inconiiftencies, it is no wonder we
find Mr. Monroe uirder aouflantembarrafiVneiits.
When Mr- Jay offered thetrirityto him in con
fidence, he refufed 10 rake it, faying it would
not answer his ends,"unless lie could Ihew it to
the committee ; ind that his promiie to them
required him to communicate it whenever it
fnould be in his power. It was then his own
fault that he did not obtain, as he might have
obtained, the treaty confidentially. If he had
not been so kind and liberal in his promises, he
would have got it, and on his own knowledge
of it, he might-have represented k truly to the
committee. It is true, when our envoy was de
sired to<ommunicate it, to enable Mr. Monroe
to perform this promise, he with great proprie
ty abfolately refufed to do so. If he had com- s
plied, after he knew the design of the request,
he would have been equally culpable with Mr.
â Monroe.
But the ex-minister affe&s to be perplexed re
lative to Mr. Jay's conduit, who after informing
him that the treaty could not bepubli/hed, ofFerÂ°- 1
ed to communicate the contents to him in eon- :
fder.ee. This was perfectly confident and prop- j
er in our envoy, who no doubt supposed it ought i
be ufeful to our public ass .irs, that our minister ,
at the IJrench republic lhould confidentially ,
know the situation of his country in relation to
so powerful a nation as Great-Britain; and
who also believed it was neither prudent cor ne- c
ceffary that our minister at Paris lhould cotnmu- 1
nicate to the French republic, w-fiatever he knew I
concerning the United States. Another .thing r
Items to the ex-minister very unaccountable,
that Mr. Jay flioiild qfier trt him the treaty and >
then denv it. Let ..e'offer
ed it in (Jeaitd it after Mr Mo:i- f
> roe had Hated thft his engagements to the com- e
mittee required him to lay the treaty before 1
them whenever he gut it ; fa.that it wis impof- f
lible to communicate it caufi^eritial'y. .
As allies, it is said the commiitee, they t
had a right to infpea the treii,y we were mak- I
ingwith Great-Brifain. Did France ever ex-
h bit to the Prefi,lent of the United States any 1
ot her tpeatics, euher before or after the/ w.era F
concluded .' This idea lb hurai!iai:i:ig, Qccs uo r
â¢ appear to Save been difappraved, but even coun
tenanced by our minister to the French repub
lic, in his letter to Mr. Jay, -where he feeqns -o
. it as a reafm for letting him have the frea
ty for the committee.
Difappointcd in getting a copy of the treaty
from our envoy, he still continued his exertion*.
Whtp MajorPinckney mas at Paris on his way
to Madrid, our minister Monroe represented to
him that Frasce was inclined to give him every
aid, it he would desire it, and wculd also fatisfy
the committee that they were net injured by the
treaty negotiated with Great-Bri ain.
It was well kntfvn to Mr. Monroe, that noth -
' e _ ing but a copv of the treaty (which he also knew
was in poffeflion of major Pinckney) would be
fatisfadlory to the committee ; and therefore
e one of the conditisnsmentioned to major Pinck-
Jl ney, on which the aid of France was to be ex
pefled, was the disclosure of ihe Britilh tieaty
le to the committee. It is thys Mr. Pinckney Un
1' derftood the propofition.aud with great proprie
ty he too refufed to (hew the treaty to the com
mittee, or toalkthp aid of France in his nego
-31 tiation Let me cite from Mr. Monroe's letter
'â  to the Secretary of State, of 14th June 1*95,
j 1 what he fays on this fubjedl : " Whilst here 1
le presented to his (major Pinckr.ey) view what
had passed between this government and myfelf
v upon the fubjetf of his miflioa, affuriqghim from
what I had heard and seen, that livas ofopin
tor, in cafe he 'would explain himfelf to th; com
"â  m " tee upâ¢ that fubjed and express a <iui/h, they
, ivbat aid they could conveniently, in
o f U pÂ° rt hh "egociation ; fatisjying them at
thejame time, that they -were not injured by Mr.
14 Jay * treaty, they would do it, &c. (<> c. Mr.
' J Pinckney wasfenfible.of the benefit which the
'I alrf of !h is republic would yield in his negotia
tion, and wished it ; hut upon mature coi.fide
'j ration he could not request such aid, without
having previously exposed to its view Mr. Jay's
" treaty, and which he did not chufe to do, for
y considerations delicacy forbade me to enquire v
into"â(page 175).
J After these unavailing endeavours to obtain
' of the treaty for the committee of public
fafet\, Mr. Monroe was oliliged to acquiesce,
a and to wait wi'.h patience till the Preiident and
n Senate lhould a<S upon it, unadvised by foreign
y councils. In endeavouring to defeat the final
n fticcefs of the million to London, every motive
c seemed to have concurred in influencing his coa
y dust in this tranfadlionâhis psrfonal dislike to
is Mr. Jay, his devotion to France, his hatred of
a England, and above all, his love to himfelf. In
: this view, he has informed tfae puklie, that he
' very early forefaw if the treaty ftiould be ratifi
>' ed,.and not agreeable to France, that he lhould
><â  probably he recalled. If Mr. Monroe did sore
r fee this, (and his penetration on this point I am
e not inelined to call in question) it is very evi- '
dent that his felf-love, or rather his anxious de-
fire to remain at Paris, would prompt him to do
0 every thing that would prevent any treaty with
" Great-Britain from being fully confirmedâl fay
; any treaty, because it was well known to him
- that any treaty with that nation would be difa
-5 greeable to the French republic-, and on this e- J
s vent he expelled his continuance in office would
f depend. This forefight which Mr. Monroe 1
thought he poffelled, and which has explained ]
s hi. fohcitude to get a copy of the treaty, will .
be a key to the sequel of his diplomatic conduit.
It was not altogether to serve France, that the 1
- representative of the United State, descended (
S to be the humble instrument of the committse,
1 but t9 Promote hi. own viewsâa thing not un- ]
\ common among the men wh 0 appear mod de- '
' voted to the will of foreign nations. 1
