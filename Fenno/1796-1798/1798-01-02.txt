Riflectiohs on Monroe's view.
N "- L
I haife perukd the publication of Mr.
Monroe, latemifttflef-W the French repub
lic, which he haÂ»s*iwufejÂ»Â» proper to call " a
view of the coaduftofthe esecutrv# oa the
foreign affaiwpf th^rUniUrdStates, connec
ted with the million of the French republic
during the years 1794, 5Â« 6," "mid which he
has illustrated with his inftruftions and cor
respondence and other autheittic documents.
Having been f'iperceded by the appoint
ment of Mr. Pinckney, the objefts of the
ex-minister are avowed to be, not merely to
vindicate himftlf, or to retrieve hit reputa
tation, from the unfavourable impressions
which his difmifSen from office may have ex
cited, and to fix acenfureon the late Presi
dent for this aft, but principally to prove
that the present misunderstanding between'
the United StaÂ»eÂ» and the. French republic,
and a rupture, should it happen, are attribu
table not to the direftory of the French re
public but to our executive, whose policy
during the whole of the European
war is pronounced by him to be inju
rious to our national charafterand interests,
" short lighted and bad." This last is a ve
ry serious charge, but is not now for the
firft time brought forward. It has been the
couftant purfui't of the French fa&ion in
our country to make this impreffioa on the
public mind and in every shape it ha* been
at one time or :anotber attemptedâThat
Mr. Morwoe wbiÂ»f# policy relative to France
I am ready (0 admit has been at variance
with the "policy of the late President from
the commencement of hit ministerial func
tions to the time ps his recall j that Mr.
Monroe, who it is nÂ«t denied has been as
true to his party as he could have been
wished, should return to his native country,
and endeavour to revive tlm antiquated
complaint, has exited in me no surprize.
Being discarded by the administration, no
alternative remained but to endeavour to
stand well with the opposition from whom
he had never separated during the whole of
bis public employment. It will net be pre
tended to have been possible for him to have
served with fidelity the executive and the
opposition faftion at the fame time; and
which he served, the documents fully evince.
A man eannotat.thefame time ferveGodand
mammon. This was in which
the late minifterto Francewas placed,and the
obvious couric which he should have taken to
have difpcltcdthe difficulties waieither to have
resigned his office and adhered to the policy
of his party, or to have abandoned his par
ty and sincerely joined his endeavours in pro
moting the. policy of the executive. He
did neither; but remaining in office hit views
were directed npt by the policy of neutral
ity and independeace, with regard to all na
tions which governed, the president, but by
a policy which should place our government
under the care and proteftion of Fraaee ; a
policy that would have confided to the ge
nerosity of France our claims upon Great-
Britain and Spain ; a policy that degraded
this country in the eyes of that republic, as
it tended to put the very being of the natiom
under its power and to reduce us to the hum
ble andhelplefs condition of Batavia. This
is the view which the documents published
by Mr. Monroe-have presented to my mind,
to fomÂ« of which I shall particularly refer in
the course of the observations which they
have suggested ; from which it will appear
that Mr. Monroe ought to have sooner been
recalled, and that it was the invariable and
sincere endeavour of the executive to pre
serve the best possible terms with France
confident with the peace and independence
of this count/y. < t
But let me firft enquire upon what prin
ciple ap honourable dif
cnarge of his duty, a fuperceded minister is
warranted of his own accord in expoling to
the foreign fiat (tan from whence he has been
removed, and to the world, the confidential
communications of his own nation ? Is it
not a violation of the faith upon which he
undertook his office ? If upon the dismission
of every public minister one consequence is
to be, the publication of the most private
ttanfaftions of the nation, the valuable pur
poses of diplomatic agents for preserving
the peace and promoting the good of fosie
ky cannot be attained. To attain thefc,
each nation will disclose to its own agents
the means which it deems the most advifea
ble to be nfed relative to its own interests,
and for one nation to ptiblifh these while
; all the other nations conceal their own, must
j place the former upon an unequal and dis
advantageous ground with them all. When
a public officer quits 3n office,whether volun
tarily or involuntarily, he is not at the fame
time discharged from all the obligations
which had been imposed oir him in the
course of official duty. If faÂ£ls or publie
documents became.known to him by reason
ofhis office, in confidence that they should
remain imdifclofed, hit obligations to secre
cy C9att*twfc â â the feirie whether he is in or
out of office. Tki knowledge is communi
cated m the firfl inflance upon an implied
promise to ob r itr*e fetrecy until permission
shall be granted to divulge. No permission
was asked by Mr. Monroe to publish the
! confidentialeorrcfpundtnce between the Presi
dent of the United States and their minister
to France, and in doing this he appears to
me to have committed a breach of duty for
which he merits a more exemplary punifh
mcnt than the silent disapprobation of the
good and faithful.
What good at this juncture could the pub
lication of these private documents promote ?
From wfcalt motive hat the publication pro
ceeded ? Was it designed to aid or to em- j
barrafs those measures of peace and concilia- j
tion with ttiÂ£ tepublic, which ate j
now in execution- ? Whatever may hi v e
been the motive, I am happy in knowing"
that if an offence has been caÂ»nmittcd which
deserves to he punifhe;!, there is a contlitu
tional mode of obtaining justice to the U
nited States, and of deterring others from
finlilar misbehaviour. To the consideration
of the proper authorities, I (hall therefore
leave this illicit and unjuftifiable procedure.

LONDON, Oftober2i.
The following statement, relative to ad
miral Duncan's fleet, and his prizts, is the
mod correft that has yet appeared :
Every British ship that was iu the aftion
of the 11th inft. is fafe arrived, either at the
Nore or in Yarmouth Roads, excepting the
Ifis, of 5b guns ; but there are no appre
hensions for her fafety.
The Dutch admiral's ship is arrived at
Yarmouth. Five other Dutch Kne of bat
tleships ate also arrived at Yarmouth, and
two inHofeley bayii if .t-o-
The Dtlf; of 56 guns, has foundered.
The Munnikendam frigate., of 44 gnus
is also loft off the lilandef Walcheren, on
the coast of Holland, but all her crew are
saved.
A lieutenant of the Beaulieu frigate, and
20 of our feamien that had been put on
board her, are m2de prisoners.
The Formidable of 98 guns, is moored
off the Texel, with two or three other ship*
to watch that harbor.
Three Dutch line of battle ftiips are still
out, as only four have entered the Texel, of
those that ran away at the beginning of the
late aftion.
It is now said, and we hope the assertion
is not unfounded, that only three persons
were loft on board the Dels, the Dutch
prize which foundered in fight of the Eng
lish coast.
Admiral lord Duncan landed at Margate
yesterday morning, in good health and spir
its. He was received with the most heart
felt gratitude, and fct â¢fflhortly afterwards
forWalmer Castle, to dinner.
A fubfeription was opened" yesterday at
Lloyd's Coffee-houfej for the widows and
orphans of those who loft their lives in the
late aftion, and upwards of 600 guineas
fublcribed in two hours ; which, before ev
ening was increased to 1000.
Captain Burgc.fi,who commanded the Ar
dent, and was killed in the late aftion with
the Dutch fleet, was an old and experienc
ed officer, in the naval service. He was
brought up under the Admirals Barrington
and Rowley, and was wounded in an
aftion la ft war, in his Majesty's ship the
London. He led the Ardent, into aftion
in a very gallant and officer-like manner 5
and although his signal was mads twice to
engage, he did not think the Ardent close
enough, reserving his fire until he was fe
near that every shot struck the enemy. The
Ardtfqt, soon after, was engaged and sur
rounded by. 5 of the enemy's ships, among
the number was the Dutch Admiral de

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
MONDAY JANUARY I.
A message was received fromj the Presi
dent the United States, inclosing a report
of the Secretary of State, founded upon the
refolutioi) of both Houses of the 2d of March
J>797Â» direfting the Pretident oi> the United
SuU-s to make enquiry of-rirc t>ia'csof Con
necticut, New-Jertey, Penufylvania, Mary
land, Virginia, Kentucky, Tcnneffee and
South Carolina, whether they had latified
the proposed amendments to the Conftituti
-911 of the United States, refpefting the fua
bijity of States; by which report, it appears
that information has been received from
Connedticat, Maryland and Virginia, that
they have ratified the said amendments ;
tint the States of Nevv-Jerfey and Peunfyl
varira have not ratified them ; that the State
of South Carolina had not yet determined
upon the queftien ; and that -no information
had yet bee* received from Kentucky and
Tenpeffee. The Secretary of State adds,
that not considering the latter as a State un
til it was formally admitted as fiich, he did
not transmit the proposition for their confed
eration until October last.âOrdered to lie
on the table. ,
Mr. Harper from the committae of Ways
and MeanÂ«, to whom was referred the peti
tion of Georga Curwen Ward, made an un
favourable report u> the petitioner, which
was concurred in by the House.
Mr. Sprague moved that the petitions of
Jonathan Hafkill and Abraham. Watson,
invalid pensioners, (presented on Thtirfday
last) be referred to'the Committe of Claims.
âAgreed.
Mr. Kittera presented a petition from the
merchants and traders of this city, praying
that Congress would authorize the ereftion
of Piers in the Delaware at Cheftcr, stating,
that there wa3 a willingness, if such a meii
sure were adopted, in the owners of the pro
perty, upon which they were to be erefleel,
to cede the fee simple to the United States.
âReferred to the Committee of Commerce
and Manufactures.
Mr. J. Williams from the committee ap
pointed to report by bill or otherwise whe
ther any, and what amendments are riecef.
fary to the aft for establishing a uniform mi
litia throughout the United States, report
ed a bill to pro Tide for organising, arming
and disciplining the militia of the United
States, which was twice read, and committ
ed for Monday next. v
Mr. Dwight Foster from the committee
of claims, reported a bill for the relief of
Comfort Sands and others, which was twice
read, and committed for Friday.
Mr. Van Allen thought the government
for Tome time past-bad been at a greater ei
pence thin necefTary in paying, by means
of the commiflioners of loans, the interest
upon the Domestic Debt of the United
States. He thought the bufineft might be
equally as well done, at a.much less expence
by either contracting with the banks in the
different states, o,r authorising the collectors
of the revenue to pay it. In order to bring
the fubjrCt under the view of the house he
proposed a refolutioi) to the following effeCt:
" Resolved, that a committee be appoint
ed to enquire whether any, and if any, what
alterations are neceflary in the a& making
proviiion for the debt of the United States."
âAgreed, and a commi;tee of three ap
pointed.
Mr. Harper, from the committee of ways
and means, to whom was referred the esti
mates of the Secretary of the Treasury, of
the Bth ult. of what would be neceflary
for the services of the year 1798, made a
report in part ; which stated \hat former
appropriations had proved deficient, and
that if a partial appropriation was not made
before the regular appropriations were gone
into, the public service might fuffer The
deficiencies were stated ?o be in the Quar
ter-Matter's and Indian. Departments, &c,
in the fubfiltence of the army, and also in
the appropriations for the naval fervicj.â
They proposed, however, to dÂ«fer any ap
propriation for the latter objeft, until they
received statements on the fubjeft from the
proper department. The report also stated
that the Secretary of the Treasury had in
formed the committee, that two awards had-'
been made under the 6th art. of the Britilh
treaty against the United States, amount
ing to 24,921 dollars;, which became pay
able in Odtober last, but which had not yet
been paid for want of funds ; and that o
ther awards have been, or are soon expefted
to be maile for upwards of 27,000 dollars.
The committee, therefore,- propoff, that
the house grant 100, coo dollars for the de
ficiencies in tUe appropriations (exclusive
of the deficiency in the naval service) and
52,000 dollars to meet the awards under the
Britilh treaty. - Committed for to-morrow*
Mr. Harper, frorathecommittee to \Vhom
was referred a resolution proposing the ap
pointment of a committee to prepare and
report a bill fpr establishing an uniform fyf
temof Bankruptcy* made a repert contain
ing the reaions whjon induced the commit
tee to believe it expedient for the house to
adopt the refutation, -.The report having
been read a fccond. time, and
Mr. H. moving it U> be committed*
Mr. Coit said, hebelieved there was some
milfake in this bafinefs,-as though he was,
of the committee appointed to consider the
fubjeft, he hadr.ever heard of this report
before ; and hj? did not believe it had been
submitted to the committee.
Mr. Harper said it had not.'
Mr. Nicholas wished, then, tin report
might be re-coramitted. He was sot him.
felf much in favor of the committee's de
tailing the reasons uppo which they aCted,
3s he thought it fervt c\ to fweU their Jour-V nal and Printers' bill without' use ; but if
reasons were to be detailed, he wiflied they
might l>e the reasons ot the committee, and ,
not of the chairman. He was one of the
commute*:, and had heard nothing of this
report, before he had now heard it read.
Mr. Harper did not know why the gen
tlemap from Virginia had so ltrong an ob
jeftion to reafoni being given forcoadtift ;
if he did not chufe to guide his conduct by
rcafon, why objeft to other gentlemen be
ing indulged with this privilege ? As to the
manner of making reports by committees,
he believed it was ufudl, when the principle
of a report was fettled, to leave the'' man
ner of making it to the chairman. But
the
were not the reasons for the report, but to. j
the report itfelf, to they were alto
gether opposed. For his part, he could
fee no ground of objection to the report j
when tha committee determined to recom
mend the adoption of the resolution, he
thought it was more proper and more ref-j
peftful to the house to report the reasons
upon which their opinion was founded,
than "merely to give an opinion without sup
port ; and were these reasons, he asked, ne
ver to be presented, except every gentle
man on a committee agreed to thÂ«m ? If
those the committee who
were in favor of the report would fay the
reasons now afiigned, were r.ot such as they
approved, he also would vote for a re-com
mittal ; but, if they were fatisfied wiih
them, he could fee no reason for recom
mitting the report, because it did not fatis
fy gentlemen opposed to the business alto
gether.
Mr. Nicholas said, if he had objefted to
thi> report because it did not contain his
own reasons, the gentleman from S. Caro
lina would have had some ground for what
he had advanced ; but this was not the cafe
âhe objefted to it because it contained the
gentleman's jreajam % and not those of
the committee ; arid though as the gentle
man had stated, he was opposed to the re
port, yet he had a right to expeft to be con
sulted refpefting any reasons which were re
ported by that committee. He was not a
little surprised that the gentleman should
infill upon his right to assign rrafons for
that house, when he must recoiled upon
how many oecafions his reasons had failed of
producing Conviftion. He was ftire it was
not the intention of the committee to give
the gentleman power to pledge them to a
ny thing he might chufe to write ; and he
thought it was time to stop this mode of re
porting. The house exptfted committee*
would report fafts ; they did not expeft
their detailed reasons. This had always
been the course of business; and if it were
to be departed from, and reasons were to be
givea, they ought to be those of the commit
tee, and not those of its chairman only.
Mr. Coit said he was as willing as any
, gentleman to submit to the opinion of a ma
jority, but he was as uuwilling as any man'
to submit to any aft which was not the aft
qS a majority. He thought the gentleman
was mistaken, when he said it was the prac
tice of commtVees to authorize their chair
man to make their reports, when once thty
bad agreed to the principle oÂ£them. The
gentleman, it was true, was much more in
the habit of being at the head cf committees
than he, and was more likely to be acquain
ted with the usual course of this kindcf bu
siness ; but if it were thejpraftice, he tho't
'it extremely improper. If, indeed, the re
port had (imply been, that the committee
were of opinion a bill ought to be reported,
no obje&ion could have been made to the
chairman's having so reported ; but when
lehgthy reasons were to be given, though
they might be very agreeable to the gentle
man himfelf, they might not be so to the
committee. It was true, that he wasoorp r
posed to the report itfelf, but this was not
the ground upon which he now afted.
Mr. Gallatin said he was not a naewber
of this committee, and therefore wholly dis
interested in the business. The treport seem
ed to be objected to on two grouads } the
one, because reasons for the report were
given at all ; and the other because they
Were the reafoni of the chairman himfelf,
and not of the committee. The firft did
aot ftrikebim a3 being forcible ; he thought
it ought to be left to the discretion of a com
mittee whether they will report the reasons
for their determination or not. With ref
peft td the latter objeftion, he agreed alto
gether with the gentlemen from Virginia 1
and Connefticut, and so far from its being 1
the custom for a chairman to report for a 1
committee what reasons he may think pro- 1
per, he believed he was entirely mistaken.
He never knew an isftance of the report of
a committee being presented to the house, 1
before it was firft laid before the committee
itfelf; for though gentlemen be in a minor
ity they ought certainly to be consulted j
with refpeft to any reasons which may be :
stated a& influencing the committee, other- 1
wife the reasons of the majority may be pla- 1
ced in the strongest light* and fliofe of the y
minority call into the (hade. Therefore,
if any thing more than a simple resolution
were reported, the report Ihould always be ]
laid before the committee, before it be pre- <
fented to the house. 1
Mr. Thatcher was proceeding Jo make t
some observations on the fubjeft : when
Mr.' Harper said, feeing the business was
likely to run into a debate, he would with
draw the report : -
WhJch, upon Mr. Nicholas's withdraw- 1
ing his motion for a re-sommitment, was
allowed. Adjourned i

ave '"I Manager, particularly rcqueft the con
ly. 1 of the publip in the abolition of a
; cudoai, which has hitherto obtained, of giving a- \
ar. Way or disposing of RETURN CHECKS at thÂ«
Theatre. <
to They are aware that gentlemen are unconscious
of any wrong done to tlie interest of the inftitu
ar- tion by this prailicc, from a general, though naif- -
taken Idea that Checks are the representatives of a
21 right to so many feats in the Theatre, during an
Evening's Entertainment, and transferable at will;
Â»â â  when in fa<S, they were never intended as more
'8" than tokens by which the Door-keepers are enabled
|i( j to afcertaia with the lead trouble to the parties, that .
. a they them/elves have been before in the Theatre, or <
paid for their admiflion.
Jt Independent of the injury the Managers sustain, J!
3n such a practice encourages a croud of idle hoys and J :
other disorderly persons to surround the doors Â«f
a t the Theatre, to the aorjuption of their morals and
ve the great annoyance of the Audience.
ry It has alfobeen thefotirce of two evils of no in
i~ considerable magnitude ; one is, that fomctiraes
9, very improper company is by these moans admit
at ted ; and (he other, that to Checks pafling
into difhonell hands, they have be:.n frequenaly
counterfeited tb a large amount for the purpofesof
>0 Sale.
'Â° This (Utement will, it is refpeftfully hoped, in
duce the Public to discourage such a traffic : and
JJ* the exertions of the Managers will, if thus affifled, -
l." easily prove adequate to its entire abolition.
