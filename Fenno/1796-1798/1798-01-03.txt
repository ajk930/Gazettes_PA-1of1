INFLECTIONS ON MONROE'S VIEW.
No. n.
The refleftions arising otit of the authen
tic documents annexed to Monroe's view,
which I fhaliprefent to tlte public, will re
late principally to his diplomatic condudt.
I might fay that the general tenor of'his ac
tions, frc.n the beginning to the end-os hiÃ
million, no Itfs fewiie to the ruling
ppwer of France, than difrefpeftful, if not
difub 1 .ent, to the executive of the United
Stat. r. furnifhed fufficient cajifcJor his re
call. But I prefer dating particular instan
ces of mifconduft, and (hall refer to the doc
uments which prove them, this being the
faireft mode of examining the fubjedl.
i In instances that have appeared to me
mud reprehcnfible, may be fpccified as fol
lows ;
}-i,- ' âHereprefented tothecommittee of
public lastly, that he was not inflnifJed to
complain of the decree, which, d"ifpenling
with some articles of the treaty of amity
and commerce, was attended with the moll
ruinous effedts on the American commerce ;
and on a proper view of the proceedings of
the executive, this representation will be
found unauthorized and erroneous.
SecondlyâV. ithout any thing to warrant
his opinion, he informed the committee of
puciic fafety, that he well Ineiu, that if upon
confederation, after the experiment made, it
should be their opinion, that it produced
any ft;lid good to the republic, to disregard
th.- 2jd aud 24th articles of the treaty, the
American government and his countrymen
would not only bear wit!) the departure with
patiiftee, but with pledfure.
ThirdlyâHe frequently represented in 1
positive terms to the committee of public 1
fafety, that Mr. Jay's mission was restrain- ;
ed to only two objedh ; to demand a com- 1
penfation for spoliations, and a furrendeV I 1
of the weftem postsâwhereas, his inftrudi- 1
ions .lated thsf maUer differently, inform- 1
ing him that the motives of the mission were I
to obtain compcnfation for spoliations and I c
a furnender of the western posts, but not
that his powers were limited t
only.
fourthlyâT]e promised to the committee I S
of public fafrty, indifcreetiy, unnecessarily e
and improperly, to communicate to them tl
the contents of the treaty negotiated by
Mr. jay witn Great-Britain, so soon as they j c
lhou!d be known to him ; and before the w
treaty, could possibly be sent to the Prefi- rt
dent, and be either ratified or rejected, he P
sent. a special messenger to London, to ob- J
tan r. copy for the express purpose of fob- J;
mitting it to the ruling power in France,and In<
pertmacioufiy refufed information of the fe
contents of the treat v. , p , nm :r I

which his inftrudHons positively forbid ;
which would in-vitably have drawn them
from a state of neutrality, and would have

REFLECTIONS ON THE NEW YEAR. | Ifia

f- I the several atts for laying a duty upon fpi- I P,

â¢d I as due to her late hnfbatud ; the report was j 3 l

h Mr. Dawfon moved the order of the day f'
:- jan the report of the Secretary of the Trea- |"'
I fury on the claim of Gen. Kofciufko ; which
1 I motion being acceded to, the house refol- '
i- ved itfelf into a committee ofthe whole, Mr. fci
e J Kittera in the chair, and the report having I 0I
i- been read,
i J Mr. Dawfon said, when he had the honor J
n of presenting this business to the house, he qUi
e J hoped the proposition he then submitted, j livi
e would have been agreed to in that way which
- in his opinion, would have been most honor- aiK
J able to the United States, and most agree- l!u '
- able Co tJl e person concerned. In this hope .T''
* V J lad been dlfa PP o ' nt eJ ; but, though they Â«
- differed as to the mode of doing the bufi- j fan
; I nets, there was but one opinion as to the I
â  J business itfelt. He had noiv a resolution to I art '
I filbmit to the .consideration of the house,
I which he trusted would meet with no op- J Bn:
I position. It would be found, by the re- RfJ
port of the Secretary of the Treasury, that i' e d
I the Accounting officers were ready to pay j I
to General Kofciufko, i2,2?0 dollars prin- rep.
cipal, and 2,947 dollars intereS from 1785 adv
to 1788. To recover those two sums, there- sou
fore, there would have been no occasion for pria
application to that house. It also states, ed i
thit a bill had been remitted to our Minis- ed
I ter 3t London, for the interest from 1789 folu
Ito 1792, but which money was afterwards mn\
Iby direction of the general, ordered to be whi
I remitted to Leipfic or Dresden ; but it did 1
not appear that this order had been com- wer,
plied with. It was clear, however, it was rose
I never received by hirp, nor had he given a- red
ny person a right to receive it. He hoped, repc
therefore, as the money lay at Amsterdam, h
I Leij ac or DrtTden, and could at any time the
be got by the United States, there would the
be no objection to paying, the general that Gra:
fiim at this time. It was furthitf stated in refol
the report, that in September. 1792, a No- and'
t.fication was published, informing all the form
Foreign affieets that proviiiou was made at lutio
the Treasury fhr the payment of the princi- each
pal of their debts, and that the interest forli
thereon would cease after the last day of De- M
cember in that year. Upon examination, dolla
he did not find that this arrangement was M
founded upon any law ; it was, therefore, lutio
a regulation agreed upon by the Treasury the 1
JJepartment, and ought not to operate to vote
the injury of persons who were ignorant of true,
a. It was well known, that, from the pe- vice'i
cufiar situation of gen Kofciufko at the that
time, that he could not I,ear of it ; and the those
truth was, he never did hear of it, until he to hii
arrived in this city. Ho hoped, therefore, what
there would be no objedion to the payment (hotil
uring of the amount of the Certificates, withia
*ling tereft to the present time. To efledt this
rigg- purpose, he p.opofed the following refo
aud lution : #
y in- " Resolved, That it is the opinion of this
1 and committee, that the Secretary Trea
liine, fury be authorized and directed to pay to
, the General Kofciufko; the interest of 6 per
I,t cent, pel - ' annum; on 12,280 dollars, 54
emys cents, the amount of the certificates receiv
es. Ed by him from the United States, and n</w
. W. loft, from the ift of January, 1789, to
; eni- the 31ft day of December, 1797.".
hg a This refoluti'on was opposed by Meflrs.
l the Macon, Coit, and J. Williams, They were
fail- opposed to interelt bejng paid up to the
ds to present time, and wished, if any provision
id 25 were made for paying interest past the time
}uar- fixed by the notification of the Treafuryj
hail- that the regulation should be a general one
il to and extend to all other foreign oiKcers.â
r no- They were also again ft paying the interest
help, which had been tranfinitted to Paris for gen.
n as Kofciuflco's use, and which, by his di'recti
the on, was afterwards transmitted to Leipfic I
s.â or Dresden, as it molt probably lay there, J
:lofe ! and would be paid to hisordtr Without their I
diti- interference.
eeze The motion was advocated by MefT. Ve- I
1â nable, Pinckney, J. Parker, Harper, Gal
>yed latin and T. Claiborne, and was finally a- I
sto greed to without a division.
leral The committee rose, the house took it I
man up. agreed to it, and referred it to a feledt I
:ing committee jo report a bill accordingly,
vere Mr. Harper called for the order of the day j
cars on the report of the cominitjee of ways j

and I report was read :

I for feversl objects, have proved deficient, and j
that before a general efhroateof deficiencies can

" Partial appropriations of this nature, have '

Mr. Harper said, that since he made the Id ?
j report which had just. been read, he had Ve
adverted to the rules of the house, and dol
tound that it was Deceffary that all appro- ma
priations for money should be firft propof- bre
ed in a committee of the whole! He wish Jed
ed the ehairman, therefore, to read the re- the
solutions as blank, and he would afterwards it c
move to nil them up with the sum s with H
which they were at present filled. m '
was done, and both the resolutions tuti
were agreed to, without debate. The house ,-ca
rose, agreed to them, and they were refer- was
red tb the comm.ttee of ways and means, to Pli g
report a b.ll accordingly. r Â®
Mr. Livingfton called for the' order of bim
the day on the report of the committee on to Â£
the Petition of the daughters of Count de a d<

Mr. Williams thought that the refo- tlm
ut'on ought to have been agreed to before pavi
the blank was filled up. He intended to the
vote against the resolution itfelf. It was * n
true, that Count de GrafTe was of great fer- ? ye ,

to his daughters. If they were to grant eafic
what was now Â»fkedft(r, he supposed they fit'

h utr j might be daughters t>f other fo.Â«tVn offi

54 cases also ? Ht was sorry for the situation
:elv " of thc petitioners ; but whilst the daughters
R<f Y of our own officers were probably fufferine;
, to for want of the payjuftly due for their fa
thers ftrvices, he could not agree to a second
appropriation for them. He wifhe'd gov
'ere ernment to be juft-before it was generous,
the They should be careful how (hey extended
100 tueir charity, and be well convinced that
irne the objeds t>f it were deserving. Industry,
iry, frugality and economy fliould be looked af
oae ter; as well as charity. Nobody knew how
â¢ the money which had been granted, had
relt been expended. He recolleftid when the
;en. widow of Col. Butler (who died in the fer-
Ai- vice] applied to the house for relief, it was
f>iic denied her. He wilhed the house to be u
?re, niform in it.s grants. The afts of limita
Â»eir tion had cut off the claims of mSny of our
, valuable officers and soldiers, and whilst they
v<2- mere unfatisfied, fie thought they ought
'al- not to be too lavish to foreigners. Head
'a- mitted that Count de Graffe had done ser
vice to our cause ; but he was under the
â it command of another country, who, he be
fit lieved, were not infhiesced altogether by
. opr interest j they had an interest of their
lay own; they wished to ftparate this country
Â»ys from Great-Britain. Upon the whole, hav
ter ing once relieved the petitioners,hethought

he I thought the feleft committee had gone to

, challenged any gentleman to pÂ«int out one
- who had a greater claim upon us, than the
' of , C Â° u . nt Graffe. No individual
had ever had it in his power to render to
l the uluted _ rTlce so singular a service as this
man. Mr. H. here took aa animated view
!Â° f . Co " dua of th = Count, in remaining
w,Â«h his fleet in this eou,try, at a very crit- .
ical period of the war, heyond the time al-
I !Â°Z e . ' whlch P r Â°dneed one of the most
I brilliant events of the war, the capture of

P oled to be g'Â»en to the Count de Graffe's

I which a protraction of the war for two years
would have cod, which was thc lowest com
putation which could be made of the fervkei
Laying aside the loss of lives and mifervl
which mufthave been the certain confeqneuv
ees, the expence alone could not be estimat
ed at less than twenty millions of dollars '
Vet they were haggling about 50 or too
dollars for the diitreffed daughters of this
man ! And when they were about to P â t
bread into their mouths, gentlemen obieft
ed to it, because they did not know how
the former grant had been expended. Would
n comport with propriety or delicacy, Mr.
if r 1 t0 he, S hten what the petitioners
mult feel under their misfortunes, by insti
tuting an enquiry of this kind > Should thev
require their daily accounts, and fay here
was a dollar mis-spent and there a dollar
ipight have been saved ? If there were any
gentleman who wished this, he did *ot envy
him his feelings. He was, however ready
to answer the enquiry. They had incurred
a debt in their pnffage to this country. They
were turned out of a convent, their father
dead and their brother an exile, they were
left to Crtk then -bread in a foreign country.
1 hey obtained credit on their estate in St.
Doming, for their passage, at,d until they
received the grant os-Congress, they subsist

unacquainted with the language and customs
of the country, was it too much to fnppofe
that they had expended in fonr years, in
paying their debts, and in their fcbfiftenee,
the 4,0c0 dollars which had been granted to
them ?He thought not. He believed eve!

to private benevolence for fiipport. Mr.H.
trufttd, that as they had, on a form.r'oc
cafion granted them a sum of money for fub

reuties. continued, withhold from themâ what was proper for their decent ftjpporh
He wi!hed the amendment he had proposed
to be adopted,arwhen they became polfeffed
of their paternal -estate, they would be ena
hded to pay baGk what they had received
'from Cungrefi. . ,
Mv. Sewajl suggested to the gentleman 1
just fat down, whether it would not be bet- 1
ter to amend the refolutiÂ«n by inserting the
following words, instead of what he had of
fered, viz. " during their necefTary residence ,
refpeclively within the United States."
Mr. Harper canfeoted.
Mr. Hartley did not like either of the a
mendments, as they were indefinite. - He
did not kriovr who was to judge ef the ne
ceflity of the residence, and it would be diffi
cult to ascertain when they became pofieffed
of their estate. He would rather grant the
petitioners something for life,or for a certain
period. On a former oceafron they made an
allowance to Baron Steuben for life, after
he had been, in a great degree, requited
far his services. Mr. H. dwelt upon the
importance of the service rendered by Count
de Graffe, in extending his stay beyond his
orders, and contrasted it with the eonduft
of Count d'Eftaing, who refufed to comply ;
with a like request ; the consequence of
which produced niifchievous effefts to the
Uuited States. He haped, therefore, an
allowance would be agreed to for five or se
ven yer.M.
Mr. Brookes believed the committee dif
fered more as to the manner of doing the
bufmefs, than on the question itfelf. He
thought there were but few members in the
House who tvould refufe aid to the petition
ers in one way or the other. Mr. B. n>ov
â ed to insert five years, or to leave the time a
blank for which the grant should be made.
He moved the latter.
Mr. Rutkdge seconded the motion, he
was as much disposed as any gentleman to
relief to the Petitioners, and be liked
the prefent'fhapetif the refojution much bet
ter than any which had boen prrfented. He
did not wish the allowance to'be for life, nor
whilst their residence should be deemed neÂ»
ceffary. He looked on" the services of the
â¢ Count de GrafTe as of great consequence to
this country, and that the situation of his I
daughters called for relief. But he coald
Â£ not fubferibe to the doftrine of his colleague
that he had rendered more important fervic- '
es in thiscountry than any other man. To
aflert this, he thought, was not doing justice ;
to our own citizens. He believed he could
mention a dozen men, who had rendered as
important services as he; bujt in mentioning
one, he might give offence to others, equal
ly deserving, and he did not with to hurt
the feelings of any of our brave citizens. 'Nor
did he admit that the services of the Count
were voluntary; .the report shewed that they
were verycarneftly solicited. He was, how
ever in favour of providing for the young
ladies. He thought the services of the fa
ther were such as claimed the attentkm of
the House to
Mr. Sewall liked his Â®wn proposition bet
ter than the substitute; but as he wished to
afford r*Kef to thtr*Petitionera.in some way,
he would-withdraw hismotien to make room
*â¢ for it.
Mr. Williams offered some remarks upon
what had fallen from the gentleman from Si-
Carolina (Mr. Harper) with refpetl to his
tender feelingt; and concluded with obser
ving, if it were a loan only which was wan
ted, the proposition fhouid be so exprefTed.
Mr. BayarcLcJld not underffftd what thev
gentleman from fc>. Carolina (Mr. Harper)
had said, went to disparage the services of
any officer of the United States. He tho't,
the warmth and enthusiasm with which that
gentleman pleaded the cause of the memori
alists was highly honourable to him. He did
not understand the services of 'â he Count de
Graffe to {land uper. the fame footing with
j those of pur own citizttis; for, though their
services were not fufficiently compensated,
yet they received something, but he or his
family, neverreceited any thing, by way of
compensation, except what had been allow
ed to his daughters. If, therefore, he were
to be put upon the fame footing of our own
citizens, his family would be entitled to
make a larger demand than any allowance
they were proposing to make them.
Mr. iLivingflon apprehended it was veny
immaterial whether the resolution was a
greed to in a limited way, or for life ; in
either cafe, he had a strong coiiviftion on
his mind, that the justice and humatiity of
the country would never fuffer these ladies
to want, whilst they remained in U. Mr.
L. severely censured what had fallen from
his colleague (Mr. Williams) and charged
him with a want of feeling to all claims, tho
he obje&ed to this, because the demands of
our own citizens were unattended to. He
added, that his constituents would r.ot thank
him for his penurioufnefs. Some gentle
men, he said, had objefted to the proposi
tion from conflitutional scruples, thinking
the conilitution did not authorise them to
extend a grant to this cafe. These gentle
men were entitled to more rofpedt. He
paid due deference to their opinions ; but
he felicitated himfelf, that these objections
had no weight with him. He afted from
those warm principles of benevolence, which
he hoped always to preserve. When the
conflitution of the United States was fra
med, it was intended for the general good ;
and in this was included, the power to re
ward services which have a claim upon our
jufticc and humanity : for though these
services might not be reduced to a demand
in pounds, fhillirigs and pence, yet if they
were such as required attention from nation
al generosity and national juflice, they
ought to be heard, and such were the ftr
vices, all inufl allow, of Count de Graffe.
Mr. L. touched upon the importance of
these ferviees to the United States, and ask
ed whether the house would deny the poor
pittance proposed to be given, when these
were considered. He deprecated the idea
of granting any thing to the petitioners on
' the ground of charity. The refolulion did
not propose this. It proposed a grant in
consideration of important f<ffvices, This
ground Was honourably, that pitiful. Ht
ftould be afli'amed a(k chtrity for the pe
trtionerrs; fie atkeJ? jufiice: he believed they
were not disposed to a(k charity. Mr. L.
concluded by juftifying the committee in
making the report they had made, as the
only one, which, in their opin ion, would
be equal to the adequate relief of the peti
tioners. <
Mr. Harper rose to juflify himfelf againjl
a charge of disparaging the merits of our own
brave' officers. He did not expe3, when it
was well known that no man had ever (hewn
ngreater regard to this daft of citizens thanth: j
had done, that such a fentimer.t Jhould for a
mi/meat have been harboured by any genthmen â "
in'that hjjufe. But he did fay, and would again j ,
fiy, that no Jingle individual had it in bis po- i
w'er to do so important an aS for the United
States as the Count de Grafse had done, though
he knew there were thousands, and tens of
thousands of our citizens, who would be rea
dy to do it, if they were placed in the famefitua
tion.
Mr- Williams answered the remarks of
his cullegue (Mr. Livingjlon J and denied '
that he had ever been backward in attending '
' to the claims of his fellow citizens ; he had al- ;
ways been ready to do them fullJ'ujlice: As to j
his conjlituenti not thanking him for objecting to '
this claim ; he thought they would be better fat is
jicd with his condu3 than if he were to com
mence a system of ptyifions.
Mr. Shepara did not think any Gentleman
would have objeSed to the proposed allowance.
No one officer, hefaid, ever didfuch important ,
â¢ services for the United States as the Count de
â  Grajfe ; and he was certain that no officer in
â  the army wouldfeel hurt lit what had fallen
i from the gentleman from S. Carolina on his sub- ;
â¢ je 3. They would le glad ti hear of our own of
ficers and soldiers being fully compensated ; but j
: if this could not be done, they would be glad to j
> find foreigners mcr?fortunate. He hoped the
1 rjotulion vuould futf' ;if net, theyJhould eh- .
â  pear odious, not only to their own country, but
â  to every other.
â  After a few words by Mr. Hartley & Mr.
- 1. Claiborne, in favour of the resolution, the
'â  qucjlion was put and carried, without a divi
> fion.
>1 The committee rose, the House took up the
1 resolution, ( the time andfum both being blank)
: , agreed to it, 57 votes being in its favour. It
â  was referred to the select committee to bring in
> i a bill. '
; j Mr. Livingston, from the committee of
1 commerce and manufactures, made unfavour
' able reports on,the following cases, viz. on the
f petition of Isaac Stevens, late a prisoner at Al

! "If the war is renewed with the Empe
ror, of which lately there was the greated
probability, and the negociation at Lisle is
interrupted, of which there can be little
doubt, the importance of the neutrality of
the United States will be encreafed in their
! eyes, though not in an equal degree as what
it would have-bren if the moderate's had
maintained theirground, under a continu
ance of the war But should peace be the
result of this aft of the Directory, the inr
| Colonc? of the demands will he proportion
ed to their date of security. The Direc-
I tory inaliprobability will endeavour to make
| pÂ»3ce with the Emperor and Euglatd im
mediately that they may at once edabiifh
their own power, and at the fame time (hew
the nation that the' removal of the forty
members and of their two colleagues was
less a measure of revenge than a flep lead- j
ing to peace. But the emperor is drongft
at this moment than ever, and the wound to
the bank cf England havir.g healed, under
circumstances that mauifeft great credit and
vigor, and the mutiny of the fleet, in being
subdued, having Hdded to the difopline of '
the BrUifh navy, and to the dreugth of the. ,â 
government, neither the Ethperor nor the ,
Britilh are noyv in a situation to Jobmit to
the terms upou which the French have hi- i
therto infilled. Ido not expeft prace this
year. The great obdaclt which lam con- ,
vincedthe commifSoners of States t
to France or any other American miniders .
upon the continent in Europe will have to /
encounter, is the idea that America is divt- J
ded into two parties ; both government and
peopleâthe one British the other French. ,
That idea, so baneful and so humiliating and i
so falfe, works at the Jiot torn of every pro- 1
' jest gnd every propofitiou. which a politi
cian forms here, and is discoverable in eve- \
ry conversation upon American affairs,
which are all supposed to have a relation to ,
such a date of things. All men entertain
it as a truth as well eftablifiied as that in
this country there existed the fame divided
before their revslution. No real
efficiency will belong to the miniders of the ,
Uhited States; no weight to their demands;
and no strength be felt or acknowledged,
until tltflt fundamental error lliall have been j
removed by such measures as the wisdom of i
government may adopt."
ioth Sept. i 797.
" It is thus, fir, a truth which cannot be
denied, that the republic of Batavia has
plirchafed her peace, her friendfhip, her pre
sent lot with France, or is indebted to her
for what (he acknowledges to be still due
(and of the unpaid sums bills as they term
them, are circulating at four and five the per j
cent entered) at the enormous price of
230,000,000 guilders, or twenty-two mil
lions and a half derling at lead.
After this certain loss that is reduced to
figures, it would be perfeftly correct to
slate 'the loss of artillery after the peace, the
depredations of the stores and magazines,
and the confifcations or seizure of the estates
in Flanders, belonging to the prince of O
range, who a fubjeft ef therepublic, if drip
ped owed his drippings to the republic of
Batavia and not to the Frenchâthe use
which is tha dominion ofFlulbing, the per
petual cloathing of troops in rotation, and
loss by affignats, at 30,000,000 more. The
'fird is account the last edimate.
Surely, too fir, mud be added that incal
culable loss which arises from the present
slate of things, not conne&ed with war rifles,
xiatv wf LlJugs, in which
we behold fear and suspicion succeed confi
dence between man and man : a dagnation
of commercial capital arising from apprehen
sions of change and nflability : the fall in va
lue of every fort of /fixed property, and a ge
neral internal decay. At Amflerdam alone,
are and have been for near three years, ele
ven hundred foips laid up and worm eaten.
It is not a fair charge againd the French
to attribute to them cxclufively, the loss of
the East-India monopoly, and the colonies
of Batavia, but it ought not to be overlook
ed while the full force of this dreadful exam
ple is under view to date as a probable thing
that if a bnld and aSive party in this country
had not invited the Freneh and encouraged their
ambitiw, there is great rsafon to believe
that the republic might have made peace
; with France as other nations ; as Prussia
did, and not have been forced into a change
of fides, and into that new war in which
such difaders have succeeded each other
â  without aJtnglt benefit."
COMMUNICATION.
(Omitted in our lafl. )
That " an adjuflment of affairs between
the United Slates and France" may be effect
ed by means of the pending negociation is
i poflible ; but it is not the more probable
because M. Talleyrand Perigord has expres
sed that sentiment with an intention of mak
ing it public in this countryâThis wary
â  and intriguing prelate has been in America,
' and has acquired a knowledge of the date
and drength of parties, not merely by ob
serving our political movements, but by in
: finuating bimfelf into the confidence of ref
peflable families ; and watching the current
of private conversation. He knew that his
1 letter would reach uÂ« while cengrefs should
be in fefiion, and thought with too much
â  reason, that it would be difficult to rally or
unite a majority in favor of protective mea
sures, while a French officer in this country
â  is authorized to fan the embers of expiring
1 hopeâHe therefore plays his part like au
< experienced aftorâHe does not doubt of
an amicable adjudment-âlf he fpeak3 to
1 shis country, can he fay lefsâHereafter he
1 will tell us that as a miniller of France he
had no right to doubt, fchat our commif
-1 fioners would agree to an amicable adjuflment
â  upon such terms as his country should dic
' tateâHas he told the consul general, that
â¢ compensation will be made for losses, and
â  that the orders for taking our vefTels will be
revoked ? Has he developed any principles,
which it is intended should form the basis
- of an accommodation? If so, let us be fa
vored with a knowledge of them. But un
- til tbefe shall be explicitly dated, we must
t continue to doubt. The consul also may
i tell the bishop that the people will not much
; longer, fufTer themselves to be duped and
f amused by fair words. Thlt the public o
r pinion with refpeft to his nation has en
t tirely changed ; and that thole sentiments
1 which he knows were general among the
- men of charafter and talents, during hi| re
: fideuce here are now adopted by the mass
- j of our citizensâpride of opirion and bad
habit# of rcafonjng mi* prefrwe <Â»n
nace of opposition within certain wa!.:., ..Jf
which fvvn his sagacity may be milled. â¢
But the friends he has left among In to c, ' n j
tinue thk system of ckrrjeil'iary visits, will
be able to inform him. that the I reP.i.
of the United States spoke the langvaj,.'>

N6w-Theatre," A
December 11, I 797-
THE Manaoirs particularly request thÂ« con
currence of the public ip the abolition of a
cuPom, which has hitherto obtained, of giving a
way or difpoling of RETURN CHfiCKS at the
Theatre.
The* are aware that gentlemen are unconscious
of an/ wrong done to t.ie interest of the inft-.tu
tionby this praflice, from a general, though mis
taken 'idea that Cheeks are the repxefentatives- of a l
fight to so many fcSts in the Theatre, during an
EveniflgYEntert&inntent, artd transferable at will ;
when in fait, they w t r; never intended as mare
than hltm by which the Door-keepers are enabled o
to ascertain wiih die 1-ail trouble to the f>,irties,th*t
they iientfelves have nceii Lcfbre in the Theatre, ior
paid for their admifTion. , '
Independent of the iajury the Managers sustain, Â°
such a pra&ice encourages a crotld of idle boys and
other disorderly persons to (iirround the doors of .
the Theatre, to the corruption of their morals and J
the-great anndyance of the Audience. n
It has .also been the source of tjvo evils of no in
considerable magnitude; one if, that faructitnes
very improper company is fcy thele means admit- Q
ted ; and the other, that to Checks palling
into dilhoneft hands, they have been frequently w
counterfeited to a large amount for the purposes of .
Sale
This statement will, it isrefpeilfully hoped, in-" -
duce the Public to discourage such a traffic : and J
the exertions of the Managers will, if thus assisted,
easily pK>ve adequate to its entire abolition.
