Mr. Imlay said, he felt considerable re- I el
lnftance in offering hi* sentiments to the P"
committee, on the fubjeft now und?r dif-j ' l
cuffion, at thi* late stage of the debate. So I 01
fully and ably, indeed, had the merits of the I
present question been difculfed, that little re- j P :
mained for him to fay, which could have m
claim to much attention from the committee. I. 1 ! 1
He would, however, solicit their indulgence l '
for a few minutes, while he made foÂ«ie gen- Â°'
eral remarks on one point en which the gen-1 in
tleman from Virginia, who brought forward 1 S c
the amendment now under debate, appear- m
ed greatly to rely for its support, atid the* P r
subjoin a few observations on the conftituti- I
onality of the amendment proposed. The I
point on vrhicK he prapaftd to remark was j J "
thaj.pf Executive patronage. The danger I" v
to be apprehended from of this I wf
patronage by the Executiveâof hi* aequir- I
ing an influence and control which would be I
mischievous and dangerous in the extreme, |
to the freedom and independence of thia I
branch of the govarnment, if Bot to the ex- j T1
iftence of the government itfelf. In hi* ap- Iw;
prehension, stars of this kind were quite I an
maginary; and from the nature and con- I wt
truftion of our government, without foun-j ci
lation. Taking into confidcration the va-1 op
ious and oppofmg interest* and paffions'on lot
which the law* of the general government I ed
lad to operate, in the opinion of enlighten- I ad
:d and unprejudiced men, there could be no me
jueftion but that the Executive branch of I uai
he government was decidedly the weakest, ant
ind that branch of the government the mod I in
ufceptible of innovation and ehcroachment. I for
3f this sentiment were many of the moil gu
>atriotic and enlightened statesmen of thi* I lim
ountry, at /the formation and adoption of the
he general constitution. For himfelf, he we
ladno heGtationto declare, and gentlty.en ten

ileafed; that there was more caufc of ap- I ant

In his opinion, it would be extremely dif- but
cult to name one solitary instance in which, but

e allied, were there no cafe* in which, on Wi

â¢ a-I On examination, he was-much inclined to

? I men profeffed to believe, that their fears for ;
ire I the fafety and prefervatien of the govern- .
ed I ment arose from the subtle and accumulat- <
lys J* ing nature of Executive influenceand patron <
les I age; bÂ«t they were not aware of the dan- <
ur I ger of Legislative usurpations, and of the J
no I evil confluences which would result there- t

ce I permit him to fay, that they should be jea- ii
I lousof the purity of their own motives, and ti
g, of their evin conduft ; that they should ex- t
th J amine both'with candor, with fiqeerity, and s

consider, that already does this house pof-- p

'â¢ to endeavour after still greater power, nay, b

i I He propoftd briefly to examine this point.
-1 The executive branch of the constitution
â  I was limited with much care in the extent
: I and duration of its powers. Its powers
â¢ I were fpecified, simple in their nature, and
â¢ i circumscribed within narrow limits. Its
â¢ I operation watched with a cautious and jea- la:
i lous eye. _ A high responsibility was attach- rei
ed to all its measures, with a salary barely 11
I adequate for its support; without emolu- tr '
I mentand without prerogative; remotely fit-
r uated from the great mass of the people, of
I and poffefiing their confidence and refpeft, e(1
I in no fraall degree, from the recollection of j Â°Jf'
j former -services, eminent virtue and diftin- ! th '
guifhed talents; and all these imperfeft and ! P l '
limited privileges, or prerogatives if such wl
they may be called, holden, as had been Â§Â»'
well observed, on the short and precarious
I tenure of a four years leaf*. tiv
On the other hand, the powers possessed Â° ff
and exercised by that house, were exercised ba '
Jby that branch of the government which e- or
manated immediately from the people them- a *'
lelves, with all their passions, interests, lo- a PI
calities, peejudices and jealousies. More 1
powerful in point of numbers than any o- C "
, therbianch of the government, highly res- 4â¢'
for its wisdom and talents, capable to t
of aft.ng with system and reason in the ac faic
coraphinments of all its measures, its povr- crs
ers more numerous and extensive, and Those tr "
but imperfedly limited and defined, with 1
â  but little, at any rate a very divided refpon- !?*
Jifbtj attached to any of its measures sand er (
with full power to raise money, and a claim tax
to the right of appropriation in all cases, and
With all these superior and eminently pow- ,ra '
erful advantages in favor of this branch of hav
the government, what cause was there for
all this alarm about executive influence all
this clamor about the danger of executive
patronage ? Forhimfelf, he could fee none, in ,
Gentlemen, he feid, could not be serious in to '
their fears on ehis fubjedf. They appear- A
ed to him to be ouite imaginary. He did a<!ls
not w,fh to be guilty Â»f unchari-able, or il-
liberal fu.fpicions on this occasion. Gen- T !
tie man had difdaimed all mischievous and livT
improper mot.ves. He was happy they had the
hopedthey were fin cere.' leirlf
Mr. Imlay said, if he were correft in fam '
this view of the fubjeft, and he truftcd he mod
was, gentlemen might quiet their
fears as to the danger of this branch of tlÂ«
government from any undue influence to v" rn
which it may be the ground of file 1
executive patronage. On the other hand, T
the danger to be apprehended for the fafetv wl '*
and preservation of the government in its
purity and perfedtion, in his opinion, arofc
the temper and difpofuion manifefied
empti on the part of this boufc to encroach on the 11
made, constitutional powers of the executive. He 1
a de- believed this to be the nature and tendency j
f our of the government, and that the history of
â¢ also, both ancient and modern republics, was in
men. confirmation of thi3 opinion. (
orded Without travelling into ancient history in j
>pera- feareh of cases in support of this general â¢ f
0 the position, he said he would content himfelf 1
they with {referring to two or three cases which

j WEDNESDAYâ MARCH â¢},
t The amendment? of the fen'ate to the bill
for ere&ing a light-house on jEatos's neck,
and for placing certain buoys in the p)aceÂ«
, n .t ju
greed to.
; Mr. Champlin presented a petition from
p the distillers of spirits at Providence, in
. Rhode-Island, praying for encouragement
of their business, either by lowering the
p duty on domestic fpiiits, or by encreafing
that on spirits imported. Referred to the
cpmmittee of wf.ys and mean r ,
Mr. J. Parker stated, that Rowing to his
late tndifpofition) he was not in the house
when the bill â  for erecting a light-house on
1 Eaton's Neck was pafltd ; but as he had re
' ceivcd inftruftions from the merehants of
- Norfolk to endeavor to get a light-house e
refted on Old Point Comfort, in Virginia,
he should propose a resolution which fhoyld
direft<he committee ef commerce and man
ufactures to enquire into the expediency of
erecting such light-house. He accordingly
! presented- a refolutiÂ®n to that effeft, which
was agreed to.
The house took up the amendment frem
the senate to the bill providing relief for. the
| widows and orphans of eertain deceased of
| ficers and soldiers, which proposed to ftrikÂ«
out that part which relates to the widows '
and orphans of nsilitia officers.
Mr. D. Foster hoped this amendment
would be cÂ«ncurred in ; as the part propos
ed to be ftruek out introduced anew prin
ciple, and if it were not concurred in the
bill would probably be loft.
Mr. W. Claiborne said the services of our
militia officers were certainly as valuable tÂ®
the cÂ®untry as those of the regular army,
and justice and policy required that the fame
attention (hould be paid to their widows and
orphans. In cafe of danger, ho supposed
the militia of the country were principally
ta be relied upon, and he thought it would
not be gÂ«od policy to rejeft a provision in
tended for the relief'of the widows and or
phans of militia officer* in cafe they ftould
fall in the defence of their country. He
would rather the bill was rejefited altogcthi
er, than that partial justice ihoiild thus be
done j but he hoped if the amendment was
disagreed to and a conference took place be
twixt the two houfes,/the senate would re
cede from this amendment.
Mr. Harper did not think the amendment
ought to be concursti in from a fear of o â¢,
ing the bill, because, if the fen?te per' c
in their amendment, the house coul a er
Wards determine whether they wou d agree
to it or lose the bill. , , â 
Mr. Gordon W2S in favÂ° r
ment frorfc the senate. H c s'!
was a ftronr reason why relit'f fhou JC S l .
en to the family of a" officer in t e ar .yT
.preference to an officer in the nn itn. e'
a man went into the army he gave up a
ther business, and of course, if c e ' !!\
country's service, his widow ana c i
were left deftituce. It was not so With the
militia. . '
Mr. T. Claiborne thought thjs an extra
ordinary reason for agreeing ta the ?mtu Â»
I . . . '.r*ment ; sos though mi!itU-roeÂ« were not
cÂ»n ftantly in service, they were frequently
called upon at a time when, to leave the.ir
plantations was amended with great loss and
inconvenience; and if the officers of the ar
my were in constant employ, they also re
' ceived conftint and good pay.
Mr. Findley wished, as much as any man
that the widows and orphans of militia of
fii should be provided for*; but because
â¢ auld not obtain relief fipr, them, he
'd not wish to deny it to other uafortu
naTt families.
Mr. Coit said, it was his opinion, that
/idews and orphans of decealed militia
rs ought to be provided for, but ,the
t nt bill was.not the proper place of do
t, as this bill was intended only to make
Â«i r: complete a former law, which did not
amain any thing refpedtiHg militia officers.
If 1 his was a general provision, the clause in
favor of militia officers might have been
proper.
Mr, Lyon could not concur in the amend
ment of the senate. Jealousies already ex
ift*d among the people, that'the federal go
vernment had a preference for a (landing ar
my, to the discouragement of the militia,
and to concur in the amendmsnt would
firengtKen those jealousies. The militia
officers, lie. said, are as rcfpedtable a ftt of
men as any in the community, and ought
not to be offended. He would rather lofc
the bill altogether, than strike out the mi.
Jitia officers.
The bill to amend the aft for laying a dÂ«-
ty on (lamped vellum, parchment and pa
per, was rtai a third time and passed.
A bill was r#ported for continuing in
force the law for prohibiting for/a limited
time, the exportation of arms and ammu
nition, and committed far to-morrow.
The house went into a committee of the
whole on the bill to continue in force the
"7* f Â»-Â£ Â»â 
aw appointing an health-officer for the state
of Maryland. The bill was agreed to with
out debate or amendment, and ordered to
je read a third time to-morrow.
Mr. D. Foster, from the committee of
tlaims, made an- unfavourable report on the
petition of Peter Vanfandt, which wascon
:urred in by the house.
Mr. N. Smith called for the order of the
lay 011 the report on the fubjeflt of making
ome alterations in the execution of the law
or the relief of persons imprisoned for debt;
vhich, being agreed to, the house rffolved
tfelf into a committee of the whole on that
Ã¼bjedt, and the report was read as follows:
The committee appointed to enquire into
the expediency of making alterations in
the adt for the relief of persons imprison
ed sot dcKt, b*Â£ leave to report.
That, in'their option, the said adl ought
o be so amended, as to extend ittnrovi
fions in express terms, to persons impriTon
;d in civil causes at the fuic of the United
States: also, that the several diftri6t judges
â jught to be authorized to iflue their war
rants, commanding the goalers to bring the ,
prisoners before them, at such time and
place as they (hall think proper to appoint,
for the purpose of executing the bufineft af
-sgned them by the said aml in
j, Ifotiris corifineiTln the cities of Philadel
phia, New-York, Boflon, Baltimore, and
Charleston, the judges ought to be empow
ered tÂ® appoint two eommiflioners to do the
Dufinefii, by reason of other judicial duties,
rbfence, sickness, or inability. Your com
nittee are also of opinion, that provision
ought to be made, by law, for the support
>f poor prisoners, during their confinement,
irevious to taking the oath provided for
them by the laid adl.
On motion, the report was amended by
ilriking out Philadelphia, New-York, &e.
naking the provision general,
Mr. Livingflon observed, that he fuppo
ed this report would go farther t!ian was
ntended. When this bnfinefs was 'firrt in
roduced on the petitior.of William Bell, the
committee of commerceandmanufadlures re
>orted to the house that one of two tfour
ses might be taken either to give relief, fpe
ially to the petitioner, or admit the princi
ple now recommended. The objedlions
hey had to the latter course were strongly
certified by the letter of the attorney-gener
lof the U.Stateswbowas (Irongly of opinion c
â  h*t thtrwgh titc O. Oiatea werrtiot specially
'tamed, they were bound by this aft. What r
hen, would be effedl of the doftrine arifmg J
iut of an adoption of this report ? It would !
>e, that in cases where the United States
,re not named, they are net bound, diredt
y contrary to the opinion of the Attorney h
General. If it did not eftabiifli that opin
an, it would, however, have a tendency to }
ftablith it, though this house had not at "
11 examined the opinion. Indeed, the o
linion of the Attorney-General of this state (j
vas directly different. The committee of >
ommerce and manufadlures thought, there- w
orej that it would be best that a determin- r
tion should firft be had in the supreme court Cl
pon which the legislature might adl; but d
hat any prerioos proceeding would not have P
he certainty which such decisions ought to r '
ave. "
. Mr. N. Smith said, it was true there was r "
difference of opinion in refpeft to the '
nfolvent Law as it refpe&s debtors of the
Jnited States. The Diftrift Judge of this p
>tate is of opinion that the United States h
re not bound, except mentioned by name, ai
In consequence of this opinion of the Di- fc
trift Jadge, several debtors had been long ti
onfined in goal, though it is agreed on all te
.ands they are worth nothing. It was true, ti
le said, the Attorney General of the United
itates is of a different ppiaion, and the Di
iridl Attorney cosicurred with him. Mr. S.
aid, he washimfelf of opinion that the Uni- M
ed States were bound by law, whether ex- pa
irefsly named or not ; but as this differ
nce of opinion was the means of keeping ju
befe persons in prison, he thought it best na
â o extend the provision. Nor did he believe bi
hat in .doing this, the house would impli- *4
"'tly adopt the dodtrine of the Diftria
Judge. This would depend upon the wor
ding of the bill, that the law was passed to bu
>t clear up doubts See. which would avoid such
y a eonclufiotr. ' â¢ ?â¢
ir The report waÂ» agreed to, and the eom
id mittee was directed to report a bill accor
r- dingly.
e- On motion of Mr. Coit, the house went

Id Messrs. Coit and Livingston for repealing

Â£ plan as when confined to the 12 mile stone,

attempted to be destroyed, and were very
e much mutilated, we shall have the law with
a Out ever having the road made. It is believ.
t ed that this extension is a mere finefle to de

to extend this evii by voting to go to Read

he has a peculiar aptness at applyingprimi
; plet, he will therefore excuse the inhabitant*
t of this place in thinking it a very dirty out,
that would keep them always riding through
the mud. As to of the mem
ber from Mââ, it was no more than was
expedled frpm him; to be sure hÂ« made a
very elaborate apology for his conduft when
he opened his budget, in which he stated he
had a number of friends to some of whose
- judgment he paid great deference, and that
F one of them advised his taking off the keen
; edge of his opposition, this certainly must
mean fomcthing unfair, unmanly or impro
-1 per, or it would aot have excited the atten

1 this good advice, his motion for a postpone
. ment or in other words a total defeat, fpeaka
â  foritfelf: his yitws it is said (but whether
: true or not we canaot aftually define) are
: for defeating this business to preserve hit
popularity ( which it is thought he would part
I with, with the fame rela&ance that a miser
. would with the last piece of gold his eyeÂ»

chance of getting into Congrefg. If a good

EOayin thefoiis 'f â¢ taiUn, to appraise the im

Umi in-ted. The author examines at each article,
whether it can be better lurnilhed from France or
Englandâ It is principally on this fubjeft (which
would haveaitonilbeda meie theorist) that the author
appears toevincegrea:Â«commercial expeiience. These
kino of laHeaux, uuluckily as 'lifficult to obtain as
they aremuthtobe desired, aiethe only fuie goidce
the fiatefinan can take for the policy of tieaties. de
prived of wliich he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We c-.rr ot too much admire the apparent ex
aftnefs of colonel Swan's calcuUuons j and alihough
ibe propbtfies of Lord Sb.ffieldhaÂ»e already been
eon radifted by experience, and by several able pens,
vet it is curious to lee the author of ibe prelent work,
dispute wiih hiin the only grouod on which he has
. not been hitherto attacked. J>y proring that France,
vinder the icqui ed condition, will be better able
than Great Britain to supply us with (everal articles,
wh.ch the Enjlilh authoi allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's patUdity tjftti on (if he
has any) does not appear to have at any time created
a pdtu J'tycf judgment. The result of this calculation
is that in >;Bg, that is to fay, ata period when arts
and manulaftuies did not present m France the vsft
means and probability of extension which they now
possess. that even in 1789, it was presumable, that
France would not only bave the means to supply one
half ofanv given quantity of the prodo&ioos of France
an,l t upland united, but also to enter ioto competition
with Great Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wildom of ber government, and ilk induihy
of ber inhabitants.

Hcuu Ts by no means fupeifluous . the principle of the
advantages which would fcfult to France from the
importation of provisions and raw matciials, is every
where applied ; % d Â« is upon this argument, that

of the premium is essential to such renewal; and
1. if the party iriuredfuffers any time to elapse after
the expiration of the former infuranee, before he
pays a premium for the renewal, he is not insured
~ during luch time ; nor can the infuranee be renew

commencement of the renewal from the expiration
A of the former infuranee. The fubjeit of insur
