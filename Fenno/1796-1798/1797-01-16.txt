mant, by the means of improved roads and the in- j Â£
land navigation of our great rivers, (the Delaware,
the Sufquehannah, the Allegheny, the Mononga-
, hela, the Ohio and their neinlerous navigable bran- g
ches) interfedling and spreading thcnafelves pve't
the whole> country ; so that scarcely a farm can be t

' net be greatly accommodated thereby, and from [(
which our variety of produce, and our manufac

be a poor equivalent for fuffcring the improvements a j,

when it il further demonttrable {even in point of in- ru

Lt direftipn, through Niede* Eckcnhcim, Lieland Schiingen, to
Steinftadt, where it falls the Rhine. At Schiingen, the
hills on the right of the rivulet (which are steep, aud covered
?r with vine>ards) furn suddenly to the northward, and run in
t-' that direction towards Mulhcim, from the eastern
l of the plain; butthofeen thtf left bak of the rivulet, whicn
aic very high and commanding, continue quite to the Rhine,
T&here 'hey terminate abruptly Not far from the fonrce of

into the rivulet of that name, âwnich, running South and S
)' Weft, through a very deep, and, for a considerable diitar.ee,
s > almost impafla'ble rayine, dilchargcs itfelf into ihe Rhine, fix
g or seven English miles above Steinftadr. A third rivulet, rif

in a nearly parallel dire&ion to the latter, through Fenerbacli,

cs Between the heads of the akoverrtentioned ravine, is a
J( j chain of high rugged hills, covered with extensive and very
thick woods.
In this alroqft inacctflible situation, was placed the right
of wing of the enepiy's army. The corps whichj:overed the ex

' round nig heights, whence the line proceeded along the hills
ZC above Ober and Nieder Eckcnoeim, Liel, Schiingen and
nc Steinftadt, all which places were flrongly occupied ; and the
left flank of the I ne came quite to the Rhine, which run>

General La Tour's column marche t from Vegehtim thro
Feldburz. The rigtr wing of it attacked the enemy in the
vineyards between Fcldburg ayd Schlirwen, whilst the left
drew them out of Felkenhetm, then t'ne ravine, and
attacked the woody hills behind it. The nature of the ground
was such, that both thefc attacksÂ«iÂ« with the most obttmate
refinance; the right, however, at length succeeded in forcing
the enemy to quit the vinevard, and reure b hind Lie!, and
the left, atter driving them oui of a great part of the wooa,
took position with its right flank t. Nieder ickenhetm, and
its left extending tow ards teueibach.
General Nauendort's column had preceded general La- J|
Tour's as far as Feldberg, whence it too,, to the left along the f
foot of the mountain on which tlands the cattle of Burglcin. j
It then divided into fcveral columns : one ot thefc attacked
the village of Siicnkirchen, and, after carrying it, defend
ed by the ravine I have described, towards Candern. Ano
ther column, ot much more coufiderable foiec, to the left of
the former, was commanded by general Naueudorf himfclf.
He attacked the ftroÃg height situated between the ravine of
Sitrenkirchen and that of Cindern, and having gpir.ed pelfcr.
(ion of them, after much oppofuion, he arrived immediately
above the town of Candern. A third column of light-infm
trytnd hufiars, commanded by major-geÂ»eial Meerfeld, drove
ths enemy from tiieitiong woody heights to the right ot Sit
zenkirchcn, and got poffeffionof all the hijh ground between
Candern and Fenerbach, which forms a part of the chain a.,4
runs between the heads of the ravines, and is connected with
the high hill between lame.iltirchen and Liel. *v these means
general Meerfeld was enabled to eftablilb a communication
near Fenerbach, with general La Tour's leftâThe enemy

BANKS OF THE MAYN, Oft. jt.
Official report transmitted by hit royal highness
the archduke Charles, to Earonde Hugel, the Im
perial commiffitntr at Fribourg, October 21.
Â«' General Moreau, who had retreated with his
whole army to the environs of Fribourg, was on
the point of crofflng the Elz, as it was supposed
with a view of proceeding towatds Kclll, to deliver
that Fortreft which was blockaded by the Auftri-
Uos. AÂ» soon as I received Information of this
movement, I set out from Offenbourg ; but did
sot succeed until the 17th in uniting my corps
d'arms ta that of general Latour : I then fixed
my encampment in front of Herbolifheim. The
enemy had peffeffed themfelvcs of the important
heigh is situated on the right bank of the Elz, and
occupied the villages situated in the space between.
In consequence of General Latour's troops labor
ing under exceflfive fatigue, having made frveral
marches in very bad roads, 1 was forced to allow
them to repose themselves till the lfcth. The .ene
my, however, attacked on that day, and notwith
standing they had in the firft inftsnce forae success,
they were in the event forced to resume the ground
they had quitted.
, " On the 19th I attacked, at evfcry point, and
i* fpitc of the advantage of the heights the enemy
possessed, the bad and a continual rain con
stantly opposing frefe obstacles to our march, the
enemy were driven from the Heights, and forced
to cross from the other fide of the Elz, General
Wartenfleben, who conducted the attack at the
Lead of the column, was da"geroufly wounded.
" The fuecefs of this aft ion was due to the In
fantry, the cavalry ne!t being able to aft. Much
difficulty was found in bringing up to the Hei glits
a few guns.
" The enemy loft 1800 men in killed & wound
ed, about 1200 prisoners, and a gun. One of their
generals of diviCons, Beaupais, was killed.
" On the 10th 1 crossed tHe Elz, and formed a
junction with general Nauendorf's corps, which
had penetrated to the other fide of Vald-Kirch.
But as the "left wing of General Latour's corps
could not be brought up in time, it being necessary
to conftruft abridge in fight of the enemy, 1 was
obliged to content myfelf with dislodging the re

(Oft. 261I1) by the wiiiÂ£ on the whole line,
from Creutznarh, as far as Kaiferflatstern. ~-The
troops of the republic have perfonfied prodigies of
valet, and the general* have continued to give
prooftof theirhravery. The main body of the ar
my, directed by the general of division Ligntville,-
whose coolness, talents, and intrepidity proved fa
fuccefsful in the campaign of 179-2 at Montmcdi,
put itfelf in motion at day-break, and fought till
night, lhat it to fay, till it was raafter of the pofi

LONDON, November 17.
NOTE,
Delivered to the miuifter for the department of
foreign affairs, by lord Malmefbury, envoy of the
British cabinet.
" The underfjgned has not failed to Irar.fmit
to his court the answer of the executive diiectoty
to the propositions wtiich he wascha-ged to m .k.,,
and which intended to serve a# overtures to a
negocia'iou of peace.
" Witji relpeift to the injurious and ofFenfivr
lnfinuations contained in that answer, and which
are only fit to throw new i 1 the way of
that reconciliation which the French gorermtient
profeffes to desire, the kin,r has thought it fat be
naath his dignity to allorv any whatever to be
returned on his part. The progress and lefait of
the negnciation wtU no doubt evince the principles
on which it (hall have'&ecn conduced pn eithflUide,
and it is neither by reproaches, as as they
are without foundation, nor by reciptoca! inftilts,
that a sincere intention is shewn to further the
work of peace. v â¢
" The undersigned proceeds therefore to the
firft object of difcuflion set forth in the answer
â of the executive directory, viz. that cf & fe
parate negociation, to which it has, without the
least foundation, fuppoied that the underfilled was
authorised to aciede. His credentials and powers,
drawn up in the usual form,' faily autho.ife him so
nigociate and conclude a peace, but they prescribe
neither tbe form and nature, nor the terms of the
future treaty. On tl-efe points he mirft, pursuant
to the custom long ettabliflied acknowledged,
conform himfelf to the inftiu&ions received from
his couit, and he has consequently not failed to in
form the minister for the department of faieign
affairs, in thetr very firft conference, that the king,
tus mailer, had etfprefsly enjoined him rot tu lilten
to any proposal tending to separate the interests of
his majesty from those of his allies.
" A' negociation which eifibraces the interests
and pretentions of all the powers *>ho make a com
mon cause with the king in this present ytrar, is
therefore the only one which can take place. I'a
the courfeof such a negociarion, the inteivention,
or at leafi the participation of these powers, will,"-
no doubt, become-abfaltrrely necessary, and hi*
majesty hopes to find at all times the fame disposition
to tfVat on a jiilt and equitable basis, of which bis
majesty .the emperor and king gave the French go
vernment so llriking a proof at the very moment of
the opening of this campaign.
" But to wait for a formar and definitire au
thority on the part of the king's* allies, before
Grey Britain and France should begin toWifcufa,
even provisionally, the principles of the negociation,
would raufe, it appears, a very useless delay. A
,> eHrfe widely difhrent has been ptlrfued by the
two powers on all forrtier occasions of the fÃrtrie na
tuie y and his majtlly is- of opinion,- that the belt.
pledge which at this moment they can give so all
Europe,-of their mutual defit-e to pot a period as
foor. as pof&ble to the calamities of war, would he
to fettle withau. delay a baftk of combined negocia
tion, and to invite their allies to participate in it,
in thebeft manner calculated to accelerate a general
peace. .
" It was with this viej* that the undersigned
had it in command to propose, at sHe very com
mencement of this negociation, a fiinciplc, vrhich,
'its T!>j <jrneraÂ£ity and t roaj faith could aloft;
to 11) n. viz. tÂ»> irulem ufy Francei by pro

will cb ifen*Mo in order to fafrttfy thcjtiil claims of

balance of Europe. I'he Executive Dire&ory haS
not explained iffelf in a precile rtiauner either on the
approbation of this principle, nor in the alterations
an<Â» modifications whicri it mayJefire; nor has it
proposed any uther principle tending to the fame
erfd. Ihe U'iderfigned, is therefore; ordered 10
refutiie this fiJbjeit, and to demand oil this head an
open declaration, in order to diorten the delay,
which must otherwise result from the difficulties
raised by the DireÂ£iory with refpedl to the form of
his power*. He is authorized to add td'this de
mand the express deciaratioh, that whilst his ma

A great outcry has been'raifed by the British party a
gainst Commodore Harney, and manv lies are circula

Let his cause be examined. Capt* Barney pursuing a
/lawful trade, as an American citizen, loft almeft his
s!l by the robberies ef the'TVitifh. Not finding retire si
for the injuri s he had I'uffered, or reftuution of hid
property, thro* the governmenUof.his country, he lie
terriiined iipoti depending oil hit individual exertions for
indemnification.âHe left America, threw up his alle

ble to afF>rd Hiiri Corresponding proteiliori, and became
a citizen oUFrince. In the service of that Republic he
has repaid hi* lotfes atid retaliated lipon his
That he had a right to leave this country- and become
a citizen of France, no one who does not contend for
the Britilk rna;,im of perpetudl allegianc# and agaiilit
the principle ellablilhed by our Judicial Tribunals can
deny; and no one who had,irretriveably loft his all,
' and all hopes of obtaining raftitntirÂ»' thrb' the govern

Capt. Barney having become a citizen of France;
and being in the fervicc of that Republic, it is his du
ty to obey their orders, arid if,' from the pusillanimity
or bad taith of our Executive, those orders ire likely to
bear heavily upon our commerce, let our merchant*
; the government/and the government aflumi
a line of canduft more Coufonant to our duties as a
neutral nation (for neutral nations bave duties as well
as rights) and repair the breach which their crooked
policy Has made between the fitter Republics.
Befidcs thi vague abuse poiired forth, bytfct BritllW
| faction against Commodore Barney, he has been fpe
eifieally aceufed of lioifting the American Sag rever.
fed, and of treating Amefican Captains at Cape Fran
cois' with unwarrantable severity.
The fails on which theft charges are grounded, we
are well informed, are these. The colors and sig
nals on board the Mcdufa had by some means got wet
op damp, and were ordered to be hoisted jwomif
cuouflytodry. In doing this the American-Sag waÂ»
unintentionally rever fed, but aa soon a Capt. Baraey
was informed of it the error rectified.
1 he ftcorid charge is founded on this eifcufnftSnce.
Commodore Barney while at the Cape wai commas*-
der of the port; information was received, that seve
ral English prisoners who had effei9ed their
' werefecreted on board neutral vessels. A search waÂ»
made and several were found concealed on board an A
-1 merican the captain of which, Commodore Bar
ney, in obedience to his duty, was obliged to confine
, in prison for afe*' days.
As to the orders of which he is the bearer, to carry
into port all American vessels bound to or from Britifli
ports, our complaints on account of them, should be
directly agaiaft tlie French government, and if Com
modore Barney executes them without any circum
fiance of aggravation, he does but his duty as a French.
( citizen and of&ctr. We believe, that on his pafTage
here he did_riat put them in force, and the notice our
Merchants now receive, that such are hts orders, ought
rather to be a caufeof th'inkfulnefs than otherwise, as
they are now on their guard, and need not adventure
their property by fending it to Englilh ports.

The real securities given for the payment of the Prizes,
are held by the President and two Directors of the Bank
Â«f Columbia, and are valued at more than half the a
mount of the lottery.
The twenty four gentlemen who by appointment of
the late Commissioners affifled in the management of the
Hotel Lottery are requested to undertake this afduous task
second time on behalf Â«f the public ; a fufficient num
:r of these having kindly accepted, it is hoped that the
riends to a NatSjnal University and the other federal ob
je<sts may continue to favor the design.
By accounts received from the different parts of the
Contineut as well as from Europe, where the tickets
have been sent for sale, the public are alfured that the
drawing will speedily commenee, and that the tare and
caution unavoidably necessary to injure a fafe disposal of
the tickets, has rendered the iliort suspension indispensable.

joint a. well as separate property of the said Gentle
men, is, ind ought to be, liable. And whereas
it iÂ« clearly and fatisfa&orily ascertained, that mr.
Blair M'Clenachan, of the said firm, has conveyed
away to mr. "John H. Uvjlon, his fon-i* law, to his
daughter, raifs M'Clenachan, and to his foil, George

TO THE PUBLIC.
THE eaation introduced into the public prints,
warning all perfonr, againlt pur' hafwjj from the
grantees of Blair M'Clenachan, any portion of the
large, real and perianal estates he conveyed away to
his fon-io law and to his ehildren was the result of
a deliberation had upÂ©Â» the fubjed\ by a general and
numerous meeting of the creditors as well of Blair
M'Clenachan and P. Moore as of Blair M'Clena
chan individually. It was no more than an execu
tion of that trust confided in the subscribers by
those creditors: a step which it would have been a
breach of duty and honor in them to have omitted.
The very fiateraent of the faÂ£i therefore mull dis
pel the imputation that it was either " precipitate
or visdiftive." It originated in a defiie to feoure
the property of the debtor as a fund for the pay
ment of his just debts. It was fan&ioned by the
advice ofcoÂ»neil as a measure ncccjfary to the fafety
of the creditors. If the advertisement hat been
injurious to Mr. M'Clenachan he owes that injury
to his own unjiiltiliable conduct, not to the iub
fciibers who have merely puUiftisd the truth in
terms as mild as the fafit would admit, and who
mean to investigate in a high court of justice the
validity of those purchases of which Mr. M'Cle
nachan so confidently fpcaks.
The subscribers therefore are bound by a sense
of duty to the areditors in general to repeat their
camion against purohafing of those grantees or
eitfier of them, and to extend the terms of it to a
porchafe from any other persons (if such there bej
whom Mr. M'Clenachan may have made similar
conveyances.
