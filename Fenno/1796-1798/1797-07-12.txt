there will be a surprising addition to the Philofu

having applied ametalic ball t-> the point, a fccond.

great man that an European Philosopher (whoal
t ready at Paris obtained marks of his efteom) will

Ted by the said creditors in the ordinary courfa t!

And as it will be for the interest of al! concerned,
that the several claims be so ftaied, and fuppori-
cd, as to prevent the delay which wouid arile trom
the necelfiiy of obtaining further information, or ad- A
ditional maieriaJsjtrom persons residing at a distance,
the general agent thinks it his duty to add, (for the H
direction chiefly of those, who, not having employ J

such claims ought in particular to fci totthâ tr

The purchafersof lots in Beula have the follo'wing
profpeAs of appreciating their property :

-1 rounded by great bodies of excellent land, capable
of producing every 'kind of grain and vegetables,
and ig yvithout doubt one ef thebeft grazing coun
tries in the United States.

ed by any on the continent.

MS. rswvo,
I IT is to be regretted, that when Farmer Giles
j avowed his want of confidence in the President,
he had not indulged the house with a detail of the
qualities which the Chief Magiftratt of the Unit
ed States ought to possess in order to command his
support. No man, perhaps, ha. rendered more
eiTential services to his country than the late Prefi
dent,but withal this he had not the good fortune to
plpafe farmer Giles. His fucceflor, who found all
the great offices filled, and therefore had nooppor.
tunity of overlooking modest mer# in the appeint
' ment.of a Poflmafler General &c. &c. has been e
qually unfucccWul in acquiring thÂ« esteem of the
Farmer and his Prhiter ! But Ido not relilh his
speech to Congress, fays farmer Giles And why ?
Bt cause it contains feme unpleasant truths relative
to the designs o( our friends the French. What !
: are the difciplcs of Robefplerre, the author of all
the atrocities which have tarnilhed the French re
. volution, become as it were by magic thechampi
r ons of France under her puroft form of govern
ment ( This is a point upon which the French na
tion ought to be enlightenedâbecause it is more
than probable, that the Jacobins in France have
not abandoned all hopes, in conjunction with their
brethren in America, of giving t* both countries
a government, which, by concentrating all powers,
i legislative, executive and judicial in the hands of a
1 few men, will revive the reign of terror in France,.
; and extend Che blessings of it to the United States.
It is mnft devoutly to be wished, that the firft
objedt of the reprelentatives of the people of France
after the admifli-in of the new third, may be to as
certain the real motives of the. directory for their
i hostile condu& towards our nationâ a conduct cal
culated to give-such courage to the enemies of rc
preientative govt rnmrntsânay, to hazard the very
( existence of republicanism. It will behove them
to enquire in the real character and designs of that
profligate fadtion in this country, who have abet
ted the directory ill their Wicked project againit
the cause of liberty, and who have had the impu
dence to style themselves the eidafivc friends of
the French revolution. Tken, and not "till then,
Hull we be able to. account fpr the following incom
prchcnfible paradoxes FirstâWhy the creatures
of the directory were so anxious to have far Prefi
fident, a man who was leagued with the miniflers
of Louis the fifteenth, in the honed scheme of fell
ing for a song, the debt due from the United States
to Franceâwhich deht ha: been since fully and ho
norably discharged. Second âWhy those persons,
whole habits are decidedly anti-republican, and '
, who in defiance of the example of France, contin
ue to kold in bondage mare than half a million of
their fellow men,,fhould be eternally bellowing in
favor of liberty and equality, and withal so fearful
of offending the directory. ThirdâWhy frandu
lant bankrupts, Britilh debtors, fugitives from jus
tice, detestable traitors, and generally all men of
infamous chara&er, have been iuvariably carefied
by the agents of the directory, to the great scan
dal and disgrace of the French nation. And lastly
âWhy the great majority of the people of the U
riited States, who, whijft they wifiied well to the
Frertch revolution when progrefling towards liber
ty by rational means, but who deplored the exceff
i es committed by the jacobins,â-fhouU be basely
1 charged by the friends of those very jacobins, with
' being enemies to France.
If I were to hazard an opinion as to the proba
ble result of such an enquiry, it would be, that a
sum equal to the expence of one campaign in Eu
rope has been fcattend from Nevv-Hampfhire to
Georgia by the agents of the directory and their
: predeceflorsânot to conciliate the fri.ndfllip of the
great mass of the people of America, becauie in
s corruptibleâbut to prep the tottering'edilice of
jacobinifm in France, by fe'uring the co-operation
us an army of mercenary janizaries on this fide of
the water, in some new oiterprize against the peace',
happinefsand liberty 01 the two nations.

FOR THE CENTINEL. J
The bridge, lately ereded over the Poto- j QI
mak, at the place where the tide meets the j
wafers from the mountains, opens a direst I
communication between the city of Wafh-1 C Â° n
ington, and the rich farmfing counties of I j
Loudon, Berkley, Fauquier, Frederick, I t
Shenandoah, Hardy, and Hampfliire, in I g Ol
Virginia,. These counties are inhabited by I j;j r
the industrious proprietors of their own y.-jj
lands, who are chiefly emigrants from the
middle and eastern dates ; preserving with f
their industrious habits, the plain republican
manners of their ancestors, in spite of the
contagion of example.
Ihe city, by means of thi3 communica- -j
tion, has now become the nearefl sea-port, CCIVi
for the immense produfts of this extensive
and valuable country, by fix or seven miles, of p
with the advantage of the best roads ; âand pur
nothing seems wanting but peace, and a
few mdre men of capital and enterprixe, to
give the most aftive spring to the most ac- p j ori
tive commerce, in this favored spot.
For the facility with which this great ob- ' re
jest has been completed, we arc principally jjatu
indebted to the enterprise and perseverance Q [ j
of that most ufeful and public spirited citi- c h 3r
zen, John Templeman, Esq. who zeal
ously engaged in the fuperintendance of the we a
work at its commencement; and fuffered no aDD â
.obstacle to impede its progress to its final V gâ r

Norfolk Borough, June 29, 1797. v
Sir, c
The letter which I had the honour to re- ti
Â» ceive from you of the 27th instant, I con- a ,
(idered it to be rrfy duty to lay before a couat tl
I Aldermen, summoned especially for that p
purpose ; I have now to communicate to w
1 you the result of oar deliberation. ' o!
' We consider it as an evil much to be de- f e
plored, that when jealousies arise between te
nations, however consequential the firft ag- th
' greffions may be, circumstances light in their K<
nature (hall in future be magnified as proofs m
of difaffe&ion ; permit us to observe, the re
charges in your letter are, w C think, some- ce
what of the latter description ; and while C r
we approbate the sensibility excited on the th
appearance of an affront to an individual of f 0
your nation, we lament the cause which j n
brings that sensibility into birth. to
The circumstances relating to Commo- w )
dore Barney were duly investigated, and we in
thought had been fettled much to the Com- vie
modore's fatisfaftion. de
The affront offered'to the Secretary of Bi
the French Consulship was never known of- fte
ficially, and permit us to assure you that if s a l
it had been known, every effort would have are
been used by the magistracy to punifli the tra
onenders.
\yith refpeft to the outrage committed mil
on the captain of marines of the Medusa, a the
complaint was lodged with one of. the Al- TI
dermen, by him and the surgeon of the fi r (l
flup : The Aldermen who heard the com- KS
plaint sent for the commonwealth's attorney, reft
and in confutation with him, left to the op- thei
tion of the injured officer the choice of has
binding the offenders to their good behavi- Grt
our (the only punilhment which the laws of Spa
this state can inflid for breaches of the fair
peace) or a profecuti'on for the recovery of a d<
damages ; the latter was the choice of the fait]
of the officer, and such suit is now under SJ.

from giving him employment, of any kind
whatever, and maftersof veflils and others, from
carrying him out of this state. The above re
