THE PETITION OF WILLIAM JESSUP,
Mailer of the American ship Mercury, of New- tr
York, humbly sets forih, h
That your petitioner being on his pafTage fronj si
St. Marc's to this porr, was laying to, about one n
' o'clock on the morning of the lftinft. in company
with a number of transports and his majesty's fii- si
gate Snccefs, commanded by capt. Pigot, when si
the Success wore ship and ran foul of the Mercuiy. o
The captain of the frigate ordered his people to n
cut away every thing they could lay their haujls t
ctn. The jib-boom, {pritfail yard, fore stay, top- i
tna'l. .flays, jib flays, flopper, (hank-painters, a
two ttrands of his small bower cable were cut Iâ>â  i
he further ordered his men to cut away .artd bring .1
on board the frigate, the and fore-top- t
fox matt flay fail, which waif done; capt. Pigot telling 1
hitmen at the fame time, they would do to make i
n ; trowfers. Your petitioner begged capt. Pigot for :
011, God's fake not to cut any more than he could nat I
STa- avoid, or words to that efftft. Capt. Pigot forth- ]
rt ; with commanded his people to bring the d d
rascal that spoke, on board the frigate. Your pc.
k ; titioncr was then seized and ordered on board the
do. frigate, where he remained for a few minutes, 'till
do. the veflels were cleared." Capt. Pigot thereupon
ila- desired the Boatswain's mates to give the d d
jvii rascal, meaning your petitioner, a good flogging,
lo } They took hr.ld of your petitioner and enquired
who he was : it was told he was the matter of the
ays Mercury. Well, said captain Pigot, flog him well,
-lis, and let him flog his officers. Theft orders were in-
Dke flantly obeyed, and in so severe and cruel a manner
hia, that your petitioner was nearly berelt of his senses.
okc During the time your petitioner was thus brutally
nd, beaten and ill-treated, he, your petitioner, made
ew- use of no offenfive language whatever, or no kind
of refiftaDce, but only begged they would have
ola. compassion on him.âNo attention was paid to his
irig crios, but, on the contrary, they proceeded to brat
him with the fame violence, until he, capt. Pigot,
to was supposed to be fatisfied. Your petitioner was
now agaiti ordered in the frigate's boat, to be put
rere on board his ship, without ever havingonce exchang
ed a word with capt. Pigot. Your petitioner ar
bon rived here the fame day, when he exhibited the
marki and bruises of his shocking treatment to a
eft, number of the molt refpedtalile inhabitants and o-
Aers in the town of Port-au Prince, who all im
und partially pronounced it an outrage of the moll bru
out tal and unmanly kind, as the certificate annexed to
this paper abundantly tefiifies;
Your petitioner, therefore, humbly pi ays your
.vs. honor to be pleased to interfere 011 his behalf, by
34 such representation as your Itonor may think meet
17 to lay before the proper authority in this country,
23 tiial fhouid take cognizsncc of she abyve affair in
