HE Fever which at this time prevails
ir unfortunate city and suburbs, is the
fame in kind as that which prevailed in
_ 3 and 1707, occafloned by imported |
lagion, and was introduced into it tor
t of efficient health laws, and the pro
egulation of quarantines ; as I propose
lake appear in a Future paper,
his contagion however appears, from j
erousobiervatiotis, and the most authen
ails, tojbe capable of producing fever,
under particuihr circumstances : These
jmftances, re'roved or avoided, thecon
a Son becomes inactive and harmless.
rhis fever had not been observed to exist
â hiladeiphia for more tha-i thirty years
re the year 1793, and has never been |
i jm to exilt in the winter season in this
ite ; differing in this refpeft, from r
: fevers thijt are bre i'in jails,
itala and prison (hips ; but perfedtly re- >
ling the plagues which have been i> tro- ;
d at difteient times into different mari
t towr.s it) Europe from certain parts of
tea, and the Tur.ki(li dominions in Eu
borflering upon Asia.
â he circumstances which render the con
foil of the Yellow Fever active and favcr
fcreading or becoming epidemic, appear
I fee, hot, rarified a< d (lagnant, or confi
tfcir, more especially when replete and al
in its salutary quality by puirid exha
ftns from dead vegetable and aninvslfub
Mces. Under the tccited circumstances
majority of thoft: who approach very
Â£ to, or comt in contaft with the sick, so
to reieive the exhalations emitted by the
gigs or (kiri, become in the course of a few
in, most commonly on the fifth or sixth
V after such exposure, iiffefted with the
toe Jtind of fever , but as all that approa< h
Siin the fame distance to the sick do not
ifi wards take the disease though they have
lifived the contagious particles into their
ilies, it implies that their constitutions are
* difpefed to favour its operation, that is,
lit they are poffefled of a power to refill
Sadtion or itnpreffion, or that the conta-
Jbn mixing with the fluids in the (tomach,
Twith tkofe in the arteries passes out again,

;.i|fhe circuudances which, in moo cases,
jifcear to give effeft to the contagion, so as

of the extreme v<=4Tels, &c.
â knionu the chief of these, may be reck
fudden exposure to gold, after great
SAigue, or after being greatly heated by ex
j&fe and exposure to the fchorching rays
Hhe fun. (
MintemperaÃce, fuÂ«ceeded by abstinence,
tpjucut blood letting, purging, fading,
tad constant terror or dread of the disease,
latre all a similar effeft. Whereas moder-
W and rcfrelhing exercise, the temperate
of such nourishing food as has no ten
icy to itimulateor influence, and rather
preserve the bowels laxative than other
e, and the temperate use of diluted fer
nted liquors, particularly found bottled
rter and claret, have the most filutary
â¢ft in preventing the operation of the
.tagion, and alfoof rendering the disease
more manageable by the phyfi-
Ji, when it d es a tack, than when it oc
rs in those previously debilitated.
The air in the open streets, I believe,
irer becomes fufficiently contaminated by
:lic contagious particles (let the patieots
g:ever so numeious in the houses) to com
municate the disease to any person walking
fc the middle of the street, or even on the
igVements, when the wind blows from the
Â»ppofite fide. This iÂ« a faft not only con
iinud by the rbfervations of the judicious
ird accurate Dr. Ruffel, in his account of a
ttjililtntial fever at Aleppo, and by all the
iyficians that have publithed an account of
l' disease, as it has appeared in disser
t parts rf Europe, but is alfoÂ»eftabli(hed
the events of last year, and by those of
93-
In the year 1793, all the prisoners in the
I of Philadelphia, amounti- g to more than
50 ; the pensioners in the alms-house; and
e patients in the Pennsylvania hospital, ef'-
ptd the disease, owing to the precaution
preventing the adrniflion of any sick or
fpicious person, its well as every infefted
licle into those places.
All the families, also, that remained in
le city, amf confined themselves and their
[imeflics ftriftty to their own houses, ar.d
ifftrcd ro sick person, one lately
covered from tbe disorder, or any material
om an infefted house, to come near them ;
id employed some trusty perfpn to furniih
em wiih rtiarketing-and other necessaries
om fourpes free from infeftion,, escaped the
fcafe without exception. This was a'fo
be cafe w'th all the farmers {hat attended
pe market, that cautiously avoided sleeping
!, or going into any of the Chambers of
ie tavtrns or [itaces where they put up
Ilia could ncst have been the cafe if the
rhole atmofphtre ot the city had been taict-
or replete with noxious exhalations.
By observing the preceding rul(es and

these arc cnnfolotary fafts, drawn from
experienced observers ; and they are fafts
that maybe fitly oppofed'to the popular
notions of contagion, so apt to affeft the
imagination in momenta of condernation
and dismay.
Before I conclude, I think it proper to
add, that I have frequently leen perfens,
whose office it is to attend on the sick, es
cape the disease in large airy apartments,
without obftrving any precaution at all; hut
have feldiom observed this to be the cafe in
small confined places unfavourable for v,en
lilatiou, especially where the circumdances
of the patient, would not admit of daily
changes of the body li ien. Clean
liness, daily changes of apparel, and free
ventilation appear, therefore, to be essential
for preventing the contagious asd malignant
effefts of tl.e fever.
Perhaps if Phyfictans and Nurses were
studiously to guasd against breathing when
near the patient, and were never to swallow
their saliva-; (by which it is probable the con
' tagion is more frequently conveyed into the
body than by an* 1 other means) were care
ful to rince their mouths with cold water
and v negar, brandy and water or wine, and
frequently to chew some agreeable aromatic
substance; were .never to approach the lick
with atvemptyftomach,and were to rub half a
drachm or a drachm of mercurial ointment
upon 'heir limba every night till it occasion
ed tendewiefs of the mouth, it would pre
vent the cont.gion from operating, or at
lead Wnder the difeufe muck more mild and
manageable when it did occur.

Having the forefail and fore topfai! set,
the wind blowing gentle breezes from tbe
S. S- W. tvith much lightning, 5 of the
seamen on the topsail yard handing the fail,
a sudden (hock of lightning came and in less
than half a minute a sudden gust of wind,
which laid the vessel's mads and yardi in the
water. âThe fsamen on the topsail yards
came down the rigging head downwards to
tbe keel of the vessel, when immediately we
cut away the weather fore and main (hrouds,
bat all to no purpofeâ(he would not reco
ver Having neither ax nor saw to cut a
way the mads, she filled instantly, having
about 3 or 4 feet of her upper fide above
water.âSame time blowing a heavy gale,
with rain and lightning, and the sea very
high breaking over us, that we scarcely
could hold fait by het fore and main chains ;
âmeantime our long boat was filled with
water, our small boat was turned bottom
upwards, and having nothing but death be
fffrc ottr fomv of -tUÂ« ftramcn ilirtir
themselves among the wreck in the water,
to endeavor to secure our boats and get the
water out of them ; When, after many hea
vy druggies, we got the small boas upset;
then we hauled the long boat, filled with
water, over the main-mad.- which was car
ried away by the deck, by which means a-
J bout one fourth of the water came ont of
her, and by the afli (lance of an empty bar
rel, we got her almost dry, and to our ?f
---tonifliment found htfr staved, and so leaky
that one hand was obliged to throw out the
water constantly for fear of finking.âWe
then had 110 other resource than to jump in
to the boat, and ride with the utmost dan
ger by 6 fathoms of the main (heet, by the
(tern, waiting till day, if wecofrd, to pro
cure some bread or water, oars or fails, for
our Iwat to sheer for the land : but to our
sorrow, the wreofc came round before the
wind, which brought us under her bow,
and having no rope npr place to take hold
of, we with one consent chose rather to ri(k
ourselves to the mercy of the Supreme Be
ing in our le-aky boats, (nine foul's in num.
ber) with one Â©ar and boat's malt, having
neither bread nor water, nor any profpedt
of getting any from the wreck. The sea
being very high-and blowing a heavy gale,
the malts and bovfprit hcing all to pieces,
and the hull going to (hatters, we bore away
before the sea, expefting every wave to
swallow us up, until 3 in the morning, when
the 1 violence of the gale aba.ted. Then we
took our (hirts from our bodies, and sewed
therr\ with ropeyarns, and fixed them to the
mast, intending to fleer for Long Island,
in cafe we did not fall in with some vessel.
Day-light coming on, and the weather be
ing calm, with a piece of the bottom board
of the boat lashed to the mast, we could
row two oars towards the N. W. at the rate
of 2 miles an hour ; rowed and failed alter
nately ; but scarcely could make any way
through theVater for the space of 35 hours
from the wreck. On the Bth Sept. at 7
o'clock A. M. we saw a fail to the weft ward
of us, distant about 5 leagues, all becalmed
âThis fight opurated like a cordial to our
fpiriti. and we rowed with all the eagerness
ai|d strength we bad, relieving each other ;
and at 10 A. M. came on board the sloop
Aurora, from Nassau in the island of Pro
vidence, bound to New-York, Brad
ley mailer, where we were received with the
great*(t friendfhip kindness by the whole

fluenced the worthy ar,d benevolent citizens
of Bait more ; who always alive to the feel

public papers, Screed to a fubferiptioh for
the relief of our diftrefled fellow citizens.
We return them all the gratitude and ref
peÂ£t to which dispositions so amiable are
entitled ; âbut it becomes our duty public
ly to Itate that a fuod has been provided for
the purpose, upon the principal of a loan
in anticipation of the liberality ana justice
of our Lfgifisture, which precludes the
necefGty of donations in m6ney from the
humane citizens of our fitter dates.âCon
tributions of pruvifions fro-n our fellow-ci
tizens in the country, as well in New Jerfcy
is in our own State,, have been forwarded
for the use cf the diftrefiVd, with a liberali

We ftat'er rurfelves that similar donations
will be continued by those generous indivi
duals, who are contiguous to the city, and
can with convenience spare a part of their
produce for the r'elifcf of fufferng humanity.
