HY HKNJAMIM D vVIES.
Fw pub!i/hin<; by fubfcriptiatt,a periodical wori
to It entitled The 'Philadelphia
and Review ; o*â¢, Monthly Repository of
Information an'ti Amusement.
AFTER the many fruitlefs v tempts, which
have been made tn eftabltfe a publication
of this kind in Philadelphia, the prcpofal. bow
submitted, will, perhaps, at firil appear to
be nothing more than filiating dilappomtment.
When, however, we observe an eager fea' c h
after knowledge fyreadinÂ£ through all parts of
our counrr\, aa lÂ«hen we contuier, that, in
these puriuits. Magazines and Reviews zct oi
un:verfa!ly-admitred utility, we are led to be
lieve, that former undertakings in this way have
failed from foine oth'r cause than the want of
difcernmetit or liberality in those, to whom the
Editor, looked up for support.
From causes, which are too evident to need
enumerating here, Americ# is, and long mult be
beholden ii> a very confiderible degree, to the ,
preiTes of Grta Britain. The literature of the j
t-.vo countfies is, indeed, a fort of common
ft. ck ; but, for one publication of our., we re- 1
i*iv.-, at least five hundred in return. While
th:: i. the cafe, it ts'extfeme folly in the publish
er -.i 3 periodical Â» ork, to rejefl, fr. m a foit of
spur ous pairiotil'm, all information, however
iileMv and all amusement, however delightsome,
merely because it is not of native produflion.
C vi<iuÂ«, however, as the justice of these re
mark null appear we have very little doubt in
our mind., that an ohflinate adherence to a con
trary notion ha. been the principal cause of the
want of success, experienced by those who have
gone before us.
Rcafon and interest unite in dilating to us a
different plan. The Mifcellanevu. part, and
priacipal part, therefore, of the Philadelphia
Magazine, will con lift of rhoice feletfl ions from '
the nrweft publications cf merit, that (hall ap
pear in Europe ; but, partu uLai ly from the va
rious periodical works pnbliihed in Great-Bii- '
tain,"of which we have taken care to insure the (
â¼cry earlielt l\ipp!y. At t?.e fame time, we trust '
it is ynnccefTary to f.iy, that we lhall always re- ,
ceiv with pleasure any original produif)ion. of j
ge- us, in verse rr prose, of our own country ; f
and we fla'ter ourselves with the hope of being j
â¢frefl (ay >ureti with the agreeable talk of giving j
to such produAions merited praxes and cxten
five O'iblieity
In fclcfling and arranging these materials, to
suit the vari"U. taile. of our readt â  , we are sen
sible how difficult a talk we hive undertaken. 1
Topleafeall wedonstiexpeA : it ould be a
rain preemption. But we are refolvcd to give t]
ofTencr to none, so far as confilis with the fupe- p
rior refpefl we ow to the fat red cause of reli- i
gion, morality, and social order. In these are a
involved the glory and welfare of our country, e
and they will ilway. be the Polar-star, that Ihall a
guide, ur Ãbors. p
The Miscellany will be followed by a month- tl
ly Summary of Acwj and politics, foreign a. ei
well as demtftie; under which head will be
comprised a fuedn<3 account of the Proceedings
if the General and State Lcgiflatuics, and the
titir-, at least, of ail the laws they lhall ena&.
The next parr of our undertaking, is a Re
â¢vi.'-u, of .he principal works of note pubhfhed
in ' ireit-Biitain. Forthiswe must neceflarily
have recou: fc"to the Reviews of that Country.
T; .)ugh i' will be impossible for us to furnifh as
complete an ana'yfis :s that from which We lhall 1
tike our materials, we ftiall not fail to give such J
an account of every publication reviewed in that el
coTitfj. as will c nvey to our reader, inforlna- P
tion '.ufiieient to enable tl;em to avail themftlte. V
at a very early ftafge, of every valuable perform- P !
ance that fhail appear. The advantages arising iNI
from such information aro evident. For want Â®
of if our profefiional men and menff taste are S 1
always kept a year or twÂ® in thÂ« rear of those .
of Great-Britain. We do not hear of a work "
till a long time after it is publilhed, and many re
very valuable ones we never hear of at all. All V
th? vario.ia injuries and privation, we fuffer S(
from this source will, we flatter ourselves, be
entirely done away by a steady adherence te our ~
P lln - . th
To ihat of foreign, will be added a Review of \
Dome/lie Publications ; and here, we most con.
fef's, that we fee! L.me diffidence, bee a use the
execution of the talk must depend, in a great
mcafure, u;>on the abilities of ourselves How
tv r, viith a firm rcfolution to be guided by de
cency, candour and truth, and to take genius H
and virtue by the hand, whenever, and in what
ever garb, we may find them ; with no wish to
wound tlte feelings of anv but the wicked, and E
with the most fincste desire of feeing our coun
trymen (hine inercry department of literature,
We doubt not, that Â« lhall be able to acquit â
ouTelves to the fatisfaftion of all those who
have the good-nature fairly to appreciate our
motives, and the justice to make allowance for
human imperfe<slions, A
I he work will close with a monthly record
of Marriages, Births, Deaths, Promotions, and Â£
othcrfafual incident..
As to what cencerns the politics of thi. coun-
try or of Â£urÂ»pc, at this momentous period, we
fsia!l alway. view with jealousy every mcafure
of the French Government, and it's cveraiftive
emissaries ; and it in this refpe& some men con
sider us as partial or prejudiced, we lhall submit (
to their censure. For so full is our conviflion
that the war, which now desolates Europe, and
menaces this count**, i* a war of ambition and
plunder, on the part of France, that nothing
ind'ire us to conceal our sentiments, or ta
Withir Id the finall assistance that we can con
tribute to eppofe them. For this reason we in
tend to devote a page or two of every number
to hillorica! tacts, anecdotes, and remarks on
the Polities of France, from the age Â«f Louis
the Fourteenth to the present more alarming e
poch. For more than a century palt has that
refllefsand ambitious peop e been like a volcano
in the centre of Europe, diftuÂ»i>ing the surround- ~"
ing State, by its intrigues, aad once in every
eight or fen years overwhelming its mod fertile
countries with devaffation asd carnage. c
Indeed it 1. more than eighteen hundred years
since the grÂ»at Roman Orator* thought it his
duty to warn hi. countrymen against that coa
duii and ihofe principles, for which the present
race of GauU are ; s juHly to be dreaded as their
favagc anceftou ; " Calli< juicm ion habendum,,
bominibus texibns, perfdis., et in ipfus Dens tut
mortcL'S impiis."
By the proper management of this topic our
countrymen wi 1 be able to fecthe real charafterof
the nation, which they fornixrly t-.i lidtud as their
friends, but now n.ute 1 fily execrate as their mft
dang-rout encniie->; and they willbe better prepar

" Paris, September 4, 1798.
"â  Tiie accounts from home (America) l
continue to discover a spirit truly worthy of }
the American name ; a ipirit which I earnest- 1
ly hope may support itfelf in all its vigour 1
through the severe trial which it ma ft under- !'
go, and which, if thus supported, will be- ''
yond all doubt carry us triumphantly thro' v
all the dangers and difficulties which weak r
and wicked men have brought upon us.
" You cannot well imagine how much the 0
attitude which our government and people a
have taken, has railed them in the opinioji ''
of the European world ; qut of France, and 0
the circle of French fanatacifin, the clear and
unequivotal voice of Europe declares that in 1
this cohteft we are right, and France is r
wrong. Our forbearance an,d longfufFering,
under accumulated injuries and insults, were 1
well known, and had in fame degree coupte- 1
nanced an idea that was gaining ground, c
that we too should link unrelifting and fub
mil live to that yoke of tyranny and oppref- 1 c
fion which bears so heavily upon the greatefl v
part of Europe. That we too should receive *
constitutions ready made from Paris, under n
the .name of the Rights of Manâshould e
have the members of our direttory prescribed
to 11s, and appointed, difmifled, replaced, e
agaih turned off, as the paroxifms of Rew- 0
bell's infirmities, should increase or abate. u
should have French generals to dittate our n
laws, and French agents to dispose of our P
public treasures, and amidst the mod burthen- a
some contributions, and insupportable de- P
predations, sing pxans of gratitude to the n
great nation and her glorious warriors. The ~
French newspapers made no scruple of an- r<
nouncing that a revolution woijld soon over- 11
throw the American government, and place P
the affairs of the United States in the hands 3 ;
of patriots devoted to France, and as it was 11
freely intimated that the influence of France
would be liberally employed to promote this : r(
deferable effeft, the ajguments were doubdefs ' a
preparing which has been publicly avowed to 5 1
juflify the robbery of the pilblic trcalures of '
Switzerland, for application in America. ai
But the tone is now totaHy changed, and the
(lgnal of the change, was the firft shew ol 1,:
firmnefs and a determination to rclift on the a:
part of our government. Dupont the ex
conful arrived at Paris. The newspapers,
not having yet received their cue, asriiounasd
that Dupont had laid that the American
People were as decided in favor of France, as
the American Government was againlj her,
and that this government would fall at the >
lirfl 111 slant of hostility from France against â 
it. Duponf soon contradifted this paragraph,
and gave it as his opinion, that a rupture ,
would only Itrengthen the Knglilh party, Â°.
and Englilti influence in America, and that a
the true patriots, French and American, P l
wished ratherforconciliatorymeafures on the in
part of France. From that moment the t0
I- rendu government have affected a friendly
dilpofition towards the United States ; as
long as Mr. Gerry continued in France, j"
every letter of Talleyrand to him, funk more 'Â°
and more of its pretcnfions, and since his dc- .
parture every opportunity has been seized
to spread the opinion, that the differences be
tween France and the United States would foofi 61
be amicably fettled. At the fame time it is
- 'rue, the strongest proofs have appeared that
the system is not changed, but onhy the P
courl'e of .manoeuvres ; that the deadliefl en- r
mityftill rages, but only involved in a deeper
mask of diflimulation and perfidy. These hi
proofs, however, are not immediately discern
ed by the world. The public here, only per
ceive the immense alteration d Talleyrand's r 'i
notes from brutal iafoltr.ce and rapacious ex- P c
tortion, to courtly complaisance, andfolicita- t0
tions ; they generally believe that France wilT 01
now yield every point of the controversy, m
and court a reconciliation as strongly as fhc
before rejected it.
" I have said that all this is dissimulation
and perfidy, not only btcaufe thvTe characters ad
| appear evident even' in Talleyrand's last let- be
1 ter to Mr. Ger.y, but because they are yet t
[ more, unequivocal in the reception and treat- ed
I went of li . Logan, a laan who publicly gives fa
- himfelf out as an envoy from the par',} in
America, opposed tp its government. Lo-;.u

port to the French eonful ; the pafl'port was
at firft re f"fed, but afterwards, upon his ex
hibiting his letters from certain Amerit;. i

rtollind, announcing himfelf every where as
bearing a puLlic million from the United
States, but avoided feeing both the Ameri
can con fill at Hamburgh, and the American '
muMfier at the Hague. After arriving at
Paris he had leveral interviews withTallev

thele Cnxumftances were formally published
; m the newlpapers, which added, that at his
â¢ request the Direftory had raised the embargo
upon alpioft all the American veffcls in the
PÂ°Â» sol Fiance. But at the fame time Tal
leyrand, iii an underhand manner, intimated
to an American public charafter, not far
; from Firtnce, and known to be warmly at
â¢ tach.ed to his government, tliat he (Talley.
â¢ rand) was sony for Logan's mission, and
had given no encouragement to itâ-That he
wiflied him to return to America, and was
â¢ disposed to negociate only with the American
go\ eminent.
" The embargo i.; certainly raised upon all
. the American veflels, for the arrcte of the
Directory ratfing.it, is published in the Re
i. dafteitr, but even this meafurt Sill proceeds
from the old i~vfitm of dividing the people
from the government*- aiid the arrettt rtfelf,
while it profertes irieudlliip for the people of
the united States, isgrofslv mlulting to the

" But this raifmg the embargo, and all
Air. Gerry's anodynes with which he will
probably t'ooll read-, home, are r.othin* fatis
fadtorv to us. The demand for tribute is
abandoned ; that for an explanation or re
cantation Â«f tlie Pielident's ipeeches is given
- up : theie ir.folent preliminaries to negncia

not exa-ftly suit the Dircftorr.
" The decree for reftraiiiing tlieir priva
) tiers in the Weft-Indies, within tine limits of
f the laws, is in fact, tantamount to nothing ;
_ if it means any thing, it must be a confeflion,
r that heretofore they have countenanced those
_ privateers in depredations contrary to the
_ laws, which I have no doubt is true ; tut
Â» which is among the Imaileft of our nunie
c reus injuries. The laws thenifelves, and the
decrees of the Directory which have the forte
s ot laws* are the greatest of those injuries r
Â» and that of 18th January, or ncjth Nivofs
j last, is altogether incompatible with the like
1 of peace between France and America,
j A very recent attempt has been Â»ade in
l the (Council of Five Hundred, to obtain a
5 repeal of this lav . It was on the 31ft of
last month, or 14th Fructidor ; a member of
! the Council, at great length ftatcd its injuf
tice,'its impolicy, and its pernicious tenden
cy, even to France itfelf. He stated as a
' certain fncl, that cf the whose nnmber of
; captures made by the French privateers, fe-
ven eighths at least were neutral property.â
, He complained that it was contrary to the
. mofl^ndilputable laws of nations, that it far
1 exceeded any thing that England had ever
[ done, and that its conlequences could onlv
enrich a few privateer -men, by the
of inoffenfive neutrals, while it drew down
upon France the universal defoliation of all
nations. Ha added that it was upon the
. point of producing a rupture with America,
and that Denmark had declared /he would
protest her commerce agairift it by military
. naval force. Nothing of all this denied
âbut one or two members anfweted that the
repeal of the law woti'lddiicuuriige privateer
ing, that the F.nglilli purchased neutral pa
pers by the bak:, and-upon fifth arguments
as these, the council pasted to the order of
the day, and left the Uw in full force.

The reason of Admiral Nelson's miffing 01
Â£ the French fleet originally, was the falfe in- j lc
1 tel'igence given to him by a neutral vedel, 'Ji
. or, perhapÂ«, one sent on purpose to deceive
him. He was told that the French fleet
had left Malta three days earlier than the lt
truth; and therefore, fappofing them to be
far advanced, he made a diredt cut to Alex- t( !
andria, whillt Buonaparte went round bv ?"
t Candia. '
Leaving Sicilv the second time, he touch
ed at the Morea, (Greece;) and learning
f that the enemy had passed Candia, about 'T
33 days before, and had dood from whence,
to the South ead, he again fleered a direst Â»'

the fleet ; but Unfortunately, in rounding ani
the reef, the Culloden, the leading ship,
commanded by the gallant Troubridge, ran f ro
aground, and could not be got at all into f !X ,

The enemy began firing as soon as our

: the Senate relative to the impeachment.
:d | I hat they had taken the further step of ad-,
of j dressing a letter to the Senate on the fabjedl
- j and as thev had been always ready to titter
" I upon the business, he milled their client
is ( would not fuffer on account of his absence.
"j . "^ he PrffitJ ent said the Senate had been
1- informed by the Clerk of Counsel being ap
-9 pointed, but had not a&ed upon the buiinefi
*s till this day.
The Prelident was about to take the que
ls flion on a postponement in the usual way of
taking qseftians in the Senate ; Â» hen
Â» Mr. Read hoped the qneftion cn this, and
all other fu jeifls which might come before
the Court, might bc decided by each Mem
her being aflced his opinion separately, as
was the custom in all other Courts of lu
ftice.
Ihe President said, as no order had been n
made to the contrary, he fliould proceed to -I
take this queflion according to the usual fÂ«
mode of taking questions in the Senate.
The queilion for poftponeirent was then (
put and carried nem. con. vi
The President then informed the Mana
gurs of the impeachment on the part of the
- House of Representatives, that this Court
t will be ready to receive them oa Monday
* next at twelve o'clock. a |
1 she Managers then withdrew ; when h
Mr. Read rose, and said the impropriety
of taking tli<s sense of the Court #n the que
flion which had been decided, must be ap
parent to all. It was lowering the dignity
â¢ and solemnity of so high a Court, to proceed -
in the decision of quellions, as if the Senate
were in their legislative capacity. It
1 usual, in Courts of Jultice of every descrip
tion, for the Judges to be applied to fepa
; ratcly for their apinions ; and that in all fu
* ture proceedings this mode might be adopt*
ed, he made a motion to that efFeft.
" Mr. Bingham thought, if any regulations j!
were neceflary on this fubjed, it would be g ]
much mere proper to make thÂ«m in their ni
legislative capacity, than in their capacity "
â a .Â« Judges. He did not think it very dignified "
f to . r Judges to be arguing a question of this
kind. Mr. B. said, that the mode adopted
had been that which he had heretofore seen
j pra&ifed on a similar occasion.
- The motion not being seconded, the court
j adjoivned to Monday next.

Salem, December 11.
Our government is under a moral ob
ligation formally to DECLARE WAR Pe
against Financeâor the principles upon
which their late measures refpe&ing her
have been founded, must be abanded as "I
falfe. It is true those measures would #n|
have been fuflicient to have roused any on
nation, po fie fling one spark of national 0 c
ho or or felf-refpeÂ«Tl, or feeling any ener
gy in her ftfources, either to propose an
honorable accommodation, or to declare E!<
an open and honorable war. But this last ih!
act is left for our government. It is true A
this formality *'ill not much alter our re
lations to France, but it will very materi- 1
ally affeft our internal situation ; for until
that is done, France will not abandon her
hopes here; her secret agci t. >vill be
more induftroufly employed than ever ; J
and divisions will be constantly excited of
and fomented i>y them. But that aÂ£t Nc
would take us at once out of our present
amphibious situation, and crush the French A r ii
party in this country. At the fame time T r
. 1 * oir
it would not create an enemy, but only rv,
put us in a situation to aft with more anc
energy against the enemy that has alrea
ty attacked us.âEvery nicafure yet taken r
by government against France, has been
opposed by men who have afterwards i
been convinced that it o ut ht to have Sta
b.en taken befcrj ; and this will tin- on !
doubtcdly Jliare the fate of the reft. d
