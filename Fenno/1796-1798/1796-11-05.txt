" It appears from the dedication, that the editor oÂ£ this
publication, is the Rsv. William Roberts, A. M. F. R. S.
Fellow of Corpus Chrifti College, Oxford; and from the
last Hurnber, that the labor, and confequeutly the merit of
hefe papers, have refled with the editor, excepting only
a few contributions particularly mentioned. The editor s
design has been, as he himfelf represents it, " to substitute
the forfaken topics of morality, life, nature, and taste, in
the room of fliallow politics and news-paper philosophy, and
to betray men 1 , under the malk of amusement, into serious
ai)d manly thoughts. This design was laudable, and the
execution was meritorious. As literary produflions, these
periodical papers are entitled to diftin&ion ; but their high
est praise is, that they are throughout calculated to pro
mote virtue and good manners."

of the eartieft and moll ironui men of our

estimable principleâand hefore he condemns such
ll a tharafter, read the work.
As far as I am capable of judging, the follow
ing appears to my 'mind, a (hort outline of his
main do&rine, in tRe " Defence of our Constitu
tions''âHe calls his work a defence of our free
governments and it 19 so. These governments were
censured by a M. Turgot,of France, because they
had a.legislature of two branchesâand an ii;de
pendent executive. He charged upon those who
formed them, too servile an imitation of the En
glish constitution. Mr. Adams had heard ef ihe
| le intended views of-a faction in Maflachufetts to in
troduce monfienr Turcot's theory there ; âto abo
lilh their separate executive, and their senateâand
wrote this hook, Vol. I, to prevent this anarchy.
_ Before he finifhed his volume an infurre&nn had
aÂ£tuallj taken place tn Maflachufetts, (1786) the
objetft ef vÂ»hich was to establish one supreme body
at to govern the Hate. The anarchists were then, as
they have since been throughout the Union, de
ns frated. In orderto vindicate the established repub
ts, lican forms of three branches, each branch having
ct a negative, Mr. Adams was led to review the, fe
,l veral governments in Europe, wherein the people
.id had any (hate. He and every man in America
knew that we not only imitated the parts of the
et > English government which were proper to be a
dopted here, to wit, a feparatiotv of the different
power* of government into three branches, the
t; complete independence of the judiciary ; âa bill
of rights ; âthe haieas corpus, arid the inettimable
*Â» trial by jury; but alio continued in France the
Cs - English (latutes-that had been heretofore adopted,
and the common law of England. These princi
ples of public policy were adopted at thefametime
that wc wifely reeded the name, and political cha
racter, of a king ; âa hereditary senate or nobi-
I'tv : and a bench of biftops âThe Enelilh Â»o
- vernment wa, ai and ha(! ten for
ages, the only one in. Europe wherein the people
had a (hare, and in which was to be found the
principle that we had aSually adopted, vis. iS, e di
vision of the powers of government into the oneâ
people, with a Negative on eachâHis work was
r particularly 3 'defence Â«f the principal outlines of
the government of this slate, where we have a go
w v ernor a senate, elofled for five years by eledtors
âand a house of delegate., chosen by the people
immediately.
In the vindication of fâÂ»h a political form, and
ot such imitations and adoptions from the Englifo
government and civil system, Mr. Adams was uÂ»der
a neceffi-y.f vindicating the Englifl, gove.nme.K,
as tar as it bore a companfon with any at that
time in Europe. Wherever his companfon takes
pl ie between that and those conations which he
was then defending, we alway., in every instance,
_ hnd that he 18 exulnsgly in f a v or of the free confti.

ad A letter is propagated in the latter, from the for- 1
be m<r, said to be from Thomas Paine, relative to Mr.
ij Adams.âThere is the higlieil probability that the 1
as whole is fabricated, or grounded in egregious mis- 1
lc- representation. 7 lie probability is, that Thomas
b- never enjoyed a single confidential coftverfation with ;
ng Mr. Adams in his life. He was a ready writet, '

ca afTerted with Paine, than Ido the stroke of politics 'â¢
he that was propagated, so industriously, about two i
1. years since, by a member of congress, viz. that '
nt Mr. Adams had said, among a few fenatora, in the '
he senate-chamber, that our government would never
lill do, till we had an hereditary firft magistrate, and '
>le senate. This story, 011 inquiry, turned out to be '
he a falfehood, or a gross mistake, " flock and block
d, It is not to be wondered at, that those writers,
ci- who have so long oppofrd and vilified the conjlitulioti,
ne which is the checked and balanced government that '
1a- Mr. Adams- so much admires; and the President, '
si- together with his measures of government, which
o are perpetually abused by Bache, (as they were by i
or hiÂ« ptedeceffor, Freneau, who, while he was one of '
Â»le Mr. Jefferfon's canJUentiaLclerks, was the editor of
he one of the moll virulent and antifederal papers in the *

1 anticipate with great pleasure the profpedt of t
fucccfs which you inform me attends our eledti f
oneering.âWhat a tcene will open in the new order '> h
of things, whicK will undoubtedly take place on the si
cledtion of M>". Jefferion to the Pteftdency ! Thf
party with whom we have always been at variance,
cverfince the terminatian of the war, have but too t]
well succeeded in all their machinationsâevery de- si
fedt of tKat equalizing pla~n oPgovernment, the cont !i
federation was exaggerated, and every difficulty re- tl
fulting from the local prejudices and habits of the V
several states was encrcjfedâparticularly those of a o:
commercial nature were worked up to such a crisis, ci
that an explofjon became inevitableâ : to these the m
paper holders artfully united themselves, who join
ing in the cry, produced the famous convention, ar
which was to remedy all our evils, by amending the g (
existing form of government : Inllead of which,
they produced the present monarchical system. Thf
confrqnences rrftrlrr-Tg (torn 11.i3 bnnrfaced" tlfdrpati
on, you Und 1 have often deplored. What progtefs
has this system made in a few years ! how has it " l
underminec the pillars of state sovereignty, by blen
ding the interests of the several states, and involving t0
and convulving those of individuals with that fyf- " r
tem, in such manner, that there is no small rifqu'c
encountered by any one who has hardihood enough
to call its infallibility in queftior,. Already do we t0
fee established a colossus, reared in our land in the V(r
form of a bankâa moniler, whose wÂ«ight and in- ,r
fluence has extended from one end of the continent
to the otheiâa funding system, of which I will not l!
affront your patience by reciting the malignant ten
dencyâa revenue government, whose ramifications
pervade every corner of the union, constituting a
phalanx of governmental retainers and expedtanti, as
which the bare contemplation of ten years ago, would
have filled the mind of every free American with to
horror.
Turn to the organization ofM he government
fee how insulated and detached are its several parts tK
from t,he refpedtive statesâit appears'like a foreign
machine operating in the midlc of them, tndepefl- an
dent and irresponsibleâand no man can doubt bat
the time will come, when the state governments, al
ready mere corporations, will be declared so, or pro
nounced useless, if not injurious. I (hall not en- do
large here, tho' 1 might fill the Pneet with amplifi- of
cationsâshould you now enquire hovv a change is to dil
be brought about in consequence of Mr. JefTerfon's 1 fei
eledtion, I anlwerâMr. Jeffcrfon it is well known al(
always had feriom objedtions to the nevv cotiftituti- tei
on, but, he uniformly opposed, even while in office, I
many prominent parts of its administrationâhe has I
objedtions to the funding system Â£ that however -waj
established if I recoiled right, while he was absent L,
in Franceâthe bank scheme received his warmed ca!
opposition, he always maintained that it was uncon- w ]
ftrtuticnal, and (till thinks so. These two form the C o
basis of the fabricâthefe null be overturned,'or pa
eflentially alteredâthe bank must be thrown off fl u
irom its connexion with the governmentâleft to
itfelf itimill decline, and by judicious attacks from
time to time, dutrng an adminiftr*tion ot four years,
may be completely crippled and overthrown. The' t h,
funding system cannot be confidefed in any other w j
light than as a system of favou'tifmâthis may be, ca |
and undoubtedly will be revised, corredled and amen
dedâand'the public money more equally diffufed.
Justice may be done to original crediters, many of
whom, or their heirs still lurvive. I need not di
late here on a fubj*dt which we have so often dis
cussed, but, the bare contem, lation of the effedts of
this fylhftj, in transferring the mass of wealth, from
the fouthern_Jto the northern states, will convincc
any one, that there ought to be a changeâthere sol
ought to be a re afiionâand a reflux of property cat
southward. This may be dÂ©ut ty a rrvifion of the Ef
system, and carrying things back to some formei int
peiicd.
But, what brightens our profpeft moil, is the the
confederation that Jeffcrfon is a phflel'itpkerâ-an en- vÂ»t
ihufiaftie admirer ef the principles ef the French Ca
25? revolution ; Â»rd who vill lay, tTiat things may not 1
be revolutionized in this country to advantage.
In the New-England States, t'ley have fomctljing
like a religious eftablilhment. Our judicial code is
boriowed from the British. We are ta-u much like
( j s that people, in our commercial, mechanical, and fo
tjje cial habits. Jeffetfon's sentiments are hostile to all S
these ; and (hotild he get into office, the whole
tribe of Anglicised Americans, Tories and Yan
-1 3 kee/T'from the tirft to the last, goei out. '
â¢om Who can contemplate the profpeft before hs,
without rapture! See what philosophy and equality
â¢ has done for Fraw** !In n frw years, every prcj'i- '
he 7 dice has been rooted up, and an order of things
has succeeded, little (l'.ort of the gr>(4en age.
Jefferfon hatrs the BritishâHe feels 4. personal a
and general imipuhy to that nation. Helovesthe
" a FrenchâTo draw eloft-r the bonds of -amity witft '
the latter, and to widtrn the dilfance between as
and 'he former, wiil he a,Â» olijtin of attentionâwill
n f?> undoubtedly take place. Shiuild an open rupture be r
the eonfequence, Britain would soon be emancjpa
ted } a revolution there would follow. Their
commerce and manufactures reft on an Amtticas
foundation, and must fall, rut off from a connexion
with us. Britain props the war agaitift Fianceâ
her commerce supports our funding system, o-.tr
banks, our nabobs. War with her, topples all
down headlong and then we begin again de novo.
A war would bring a crisis that would aecelerate
ffce execution of our plans ; but as its chances are
uncertain, I do not wish it : our business may and
will be done as effe&ually without one.
SAYS A CORRESPONDENT,
The majority in the city, for the anti-federal tic
-0 ket of eleflors, can by no means be considered as
'P" indicative of the permanent strength of the fa&ion
opposed to the government; as, amonglt that ma
m" jority mull be ranked a far greater number than the c

formerly merchants of this city, and who failed in the
year 1763, or 1764, (and from whom the fubferiher pur
chased bills of exchange to amount of several hundred '
pounds sterling, which have lain by him ever since,) are
requested, everv mam or them that is living, to meet at
the City-Tavern on Tucfday, the 15th of Novembur next, i
at 6 o'clock in the evening, in order to oblige Charles
Cox, formerly of this city, now of New-Jersey, and John
Bayard, formerly of said cityi, and speaker of the House
ol Assembly of said state, now of Brunfwick, New-Jersey,
assignees of said Scott & M'Michael, to come forward aad
pay over the monies they have had in their hands belong- \
tng to the creditors these 32 or 33 years. Some years a
go the creditors were called together ; Mr. Cox appear
ed in behalf of himfelf and Mr. Bayard, and alleged that .
' they were apprehenlive they might be brought into trou
ble if they parted with the money (which I apprehend is
some thousands,) as his Britannic Majesty had a debt due Â°
him for government bills: it was however agreed by the f
creditors met, th it the assignees Ihoul J take the opinion of "
counsel; they did so, and it was that they would be fafe .
in dividing the money among the creditors. I urged Mr. 11
Cox to bnngthebufinefstoa final close ; his answer was,
it would be but a trifling sum; my reply was, if ever so *
trifling, I would have my proportion of it. It has how
ever lain over.
I therefore hope the creditors will now come forward *
and oblige the afiignoes to divide whatever they have, and
they onght to pay interest too.
