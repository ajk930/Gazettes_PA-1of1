Among several new experiments, too tedious,to
enumerate, there will be *
The.Aftoniihing Magnetism, 1
The virtue of which the Performer will communi- '
cafe to the distance of twelve feet, both by light and 1
feeling. I
A. curious and philnfopliical difcovcry of lighting j
a Candle with a Card, Knife, or Sword, without (
any Fire. ,
After a Nfw Exhibition of philofophlcal experi
ments, which the exhibitor omits to mention, with a 1
view to surprise the company, will be a representation ]
of that Terror of Nature, i
A Thunder-storm at Sea.
In which will be seen the swelling of the sea,
and the waves rolling with incredible impetuosity ; 1
the flcy wonderfully covered with clouds ; the natural
appearance of hail, with its concomitant noise, and :
a Stti{> in Distress, which after a lonjj struggle is dif- â¢
mailed am} goes down. The manoeuvring l of the j
veflel in this dreadfiil Creation will not only excite j
admiration in the fpl&ators in general but to every j
feafaring person â  pre(eitt>;\fcho rsuli acknowledge the j '
whole calamitous scene td'bjj exceedingly natural, ; '
and the greatest piece of ingenuity of the kind ever
exhibited in this part of the worltJâAil to be aeeom

near a resemblance as to aftonilh the company.
After the storm will follow an appe?.ranDe of all ! '
kinds of filh, and the result of thelofs of the velfelâ ;
â which the exhibitor is Confident will give entire fatif
faflion and a perfect idea of a Shipwreck, to such <
persons as have never seen any thing' of the kind. 11

The appearance of a Young.Lady,

FOIL THE GAZETTE OF UNITED STATES.
Mr. Fenno, ]
A STRANGER lately arrived from Europe,
j has taken the liberty to address you on a fubjeft of 1
great importance to all emigrants to these United ,
States, and to reqnell a candid anftver from some 1
one of your ingenious cowefpondents, to the sol- 1
lowing queries, viz. _ ;
How ought a stranger to demean himfelf in mix
ed companies, where politics are the only tfcpic ? 1
Would a German or an Englishman be more or )
less efleemed for speaking favourably of his owa |
-country, and of its culloms, when questioned on ,
these fubjeAs ? _ 1
I am induced to a(k these questions,
heard, that several foreigners, now in refpeÂ£iable <
offices, have been promoted for their affedied con- 1
tempt of their native countries. As this is con , |
traiy to all genaral rule 3 and maxims, I do not vvifh. 1
to, " befoul my own nejl," until lam confident that* ]
this is the true line to promotion in America. j
I offer these fcrnples,that my advifermaybe under â 
no mistake refpefting my original opinions on the ;
peints in question. Can it be expetltd, that an ]
individual, who vilifies his native country, and his 1
nearest connections and re'.atiops, will be true to
any other ? May not those persons, who have facri
fieed their original social compaftsto foreign views
in a foreign country, be more liable to make a se
cond factilke, if a second profpeft of gain.Uiould
ever present itfelf, than if they had continued ever .
true to the pared social principles ?
If a foreign emissary should attempt to carfy aji'
important point, by intrigue or bribery, would
not single out thofeperfons as his inltruments, who'
having already got rid of all loca ties and confci
entious scruples, have of course less reluctance to
repeat their iins, than others have to cÂ»mmence
finning ?
I know it may be said as well of a man as of a
woman, that " to deliberate on a qutjlion of virtue,
is to be loft but as this is entirely my own con
cern, I beg that my respondent may conÂ£ne him
felf to modern expediency, rather than to oldfajh
ioned morality.

FÂ«r the Gaiette of the United States.
Mr. Fbnno, i
SIR,
THE attack upon the conduct of the managers
of the New-Theatre, relative to the advanced price
of box and pit tickets, which appeared in yeur pa
per of Monday last, under the signature of Honest
Policy ; is equally illiberal and unjufh Illiberal
from the arguments adduced againit the advance,
and unjust from the personal attack made upon the
managers, who certainly cannst be aecufed of any
want of industry or exertion, in placing the theatri
cal entertainmants of this city, upon a rtfpe&able
footing.
The firft aflertion of your correspondent is cer
tainly taken for granted. It is yet to be ascertain
ed,- whether the policy of the managers, be Â»equal
ly unpleasant as it <was unexpeSed." The managers
have " relied not upon the general rage for none/ty,"
but " upon the liberality tf the citizens of Philadel
phia and tormy own part I believe, tbtt the ex
ercife of that liberality, may yet contraiiff the
confident prediction above quoted. His next re
mark, deserves the feverell aninpadverfien ; such a
phraf? as " encroachments upon our purses," can be 1
deserved only by impofters and swindlers. I be- 1
lieve that the inhabitants of this city will not join
with your correspondent, in the application of it,
to the coHdu&ors of the entertainments of the New-
Theatre.
Your correfpondeÃt next remarks, that, " fup
pbfing that the funds of the Theatre are in the li
tuation represented, the plan of the managers is in
efficient." On that head they may be mistaken, buti
even admitting that his ideas are just, their errbr!
! does not call for fucu IÂ«ud and malignant terms of
reprehension. >
1 I beg leave only to observe, that if the Theatrt
; has been moitothan large enough to contain all whi
j have hitherto attended it ; the disbursements necef
fary to detorate and illuminate such an cxtenfive
building mult be proportionably great. This cir
cumstance theretore furnilbes a plea for con
j dad. The epithet of '< aUfurÂ«J," which,hi Applied
' by your correspondent to the Â« increase of price
â¢without an increase of entertainment," would be with
more jultice applied to his own.remaik. Jf I ap.
prebend his meaning rightly, he would wifWihe ma
hagers to struggle through their nrefent dfficultics,
' j with nothing more than fub'fifteocev If a
taidft increasing diibuifcments they are nofipcrmtt
ted to raise their prices, theatrical entertainments
must soon come ta a period. No man cait be ex-|
{ petted to devote his time, his talents, 'and his irge-l
, | nuity, to any particular profefljoii, without a chancel
. ; of remuneration proportioned to the demands whicli
may be made upon him. The h'beral and enlighj
eÂ»ed will not htfitate to acknowledge that a mail
who gives his whole lime and attention to any mc-|
chanical employment, or to any liberal art, has a
claim up6n his fellow-citizens, for funds not onlyl
adequate to his present support, but aj/oto the conJ
tingencies of futurity. The divire, .the lawyer,
the physician, the merchant, exped, and with' jus'
tice expedt, that they arc not to consume the belt
years of their life, in toil and exertion, without the
profpedt of ease and compensation in their old
Neither of these charafteis exerts more affidjiity in
the service of mankind, than they did formerly;
yet, unlets theirfees and emoluments, were adapted 11
to the encreafing exigencies of the times, each of
these proftffions must soon be deserted.
Upon the comparative merit of the former or
( preftnt company, it belongs to the public to de
j cide. _ I have been often delighted vriih the repre- P
. ( foliations of preceding seasons, and I do not ex. I
I f>eft to be less entertained during the present. With-1
, refpedt to your correspondent's remarks upon the I
j theatrical arrangements of the last season, I have ]
i only to observe that they betray equal illiberal,'ty \
and equal igÂ»orance, with the reft of his letter. I f
do not believe that the managers would for a mo- (
meat htfitate to acknowledge their gratitude for
/
r > *
tli* support that they received ; lnÂ» surely it is a 'â¢
reflexion upon the taste of our citizens, to suppose '
that their liberality would have been extended to |
performances " deferring of nothing bit contempt.'
They were supported by most of the performers 1
whom yourcorrefpondeflt mentions in another part
of his letter, with apparent approbation ; and that
taste mud hare bean faftidious indeed, that could
not have derived entertainment from their talents
and exertions. v
He addresses his remarks to the lovers of the /Ira- 1
ma to them alfa I would addrefsthis reply. Wlien
they contemplate the improvement of theatrical ex- i
hibitiotis in the New-Thcatrc, the elegance of the
decorations, the encreafing salaries of a company, ;
refpe&able for numbers and for talents, and the ex 1
pence of constantly maintaining a large and well dif '
ciplined band ; when they recoHeft that for all
these improvements, no greater eompenfÂ»tion has
been hitherto alked, than what was demanded for !
the entertainments of the Old-Theatre,, they will J
furi-ly not accuse the managers of fliameful and *n
jujl impvfitions, on account of their moderate ad- 1
vanec. The theatrical entertainments of this city
are at present upsri a most refpe&able footing. 1 1
hope that the liberality of our citizens, will attend 1
the exertions of the managers, and invite tliem to ]
ftill.fuither improvement.

\ WAR OPERATIONS.
LONDON, October 18.
Another mail from Hamburgh arrived yellerday,
being the .last but one of the three wli'oii were due.
The rroit important intelligence vtfhich it contains
is the narrative of the ikirmifhes which general Mo
reau has had tofuftain in his retreat. Wc have no
accurate accouat, howrfyif, of his lofles, or even
6f his true position. In one paper it is said he has ,
loft 16,000 men ; in others, That his losses has been
very infignificant ; and every other article refpe#t- '
ing the march of the armies, is equally doubtful.â '
Ulm, in one letter, is said to have been surrendered Â°
by capitulation ; in another, that it was abandoned
by the French in the night. From all these con- 1
tradiftory rumours it appears, that nothing precise
or authentic was known to the journalifls, on the [
fubjedt of this retreat} and we fee only that Mo- '
reau is in full march, with such a start of his ,pur
suers, as toafcertain hiaratreat with the major part 1
of his army ; a circumllancc which the great zea
lots in the prosecution of the war thought it im
puffiblc that he should effect.
The Vienna Gazette contains a number of de
tails from Italy, in whkh we are given to under
stand, that Wurmfer's (ituation was much lefa '
disastrous than the French papers announced it to
be. Private letters from Bremen, Rate various re
ports of a defeat fuffered by Buonaparte ; in one
he is said to be killed, in another to be a prisoner t (
but the whole of the story, in all its versions, has j
so little character of probability, as to be entitled
tp no credit.

j; Yesterday morning arrived a courier from fir W.
Milton, at Naples, and also the second of the
'/three mails that wete due frem Hamburg, with let
ters from thence of the 7th inft.
It will be recollected, that the last letters from ,
general Buonaparte vere dated the 16th of Sep- ]
tember, and only gave an account of the operations
of his army to the 15th ult. They merely refpes- s
ted the events that had taken place near Manntua,
but did not allude to any thing that had passed in
I the Tyrolefe, or in the vicinity of Trente. The
information contained in the Vienna Court Gazette (
I only regards general Wurmfer's operations to the J
1 15th ; thrre is of courfc no mention made of the
battle of St. George, which happened ofi the 141*1
near the gates of Mantua ; & the result of which,
according to the French general's account, forced c
general Wurmfer to take refuge in that fartrefs, f
which he expected would capitulate in a few days.
Buonaparte has not, however, fuccecded in Jits ex- t
pa&atiom. â¢ (
According to the advir w from Naples it appears, t
that field-marlhall YVurtnfer made forties from Man- ]
tua on the 21ft, 22d, and 23d ult and attacked <
and defeated the French on each of those days near }
I Duo Callclli and Roverbella, between Mantui and
Verona, to which latter place Buonapartehad fall,
en back on the 26th. These events evidently (hew, r
that the Austrian army in and near Mantua,, is by ,
no means in that diftteffed iituatioo iÂ« which Bu- ]
onaparte's official report aflertei it to he : and that f
we may (till hop<S to receive eie long, some fatisfac
tory news from that part of the theatre ot war. t
The proifrefs of general Davidovich in the Ty- 1
Iroleft, and his march to Trente, noticed in the Vi- c
enna Court Gazette, con-firms our former Conjec
tures, that Buanapartc may be hemmed in between j
that general's army and that of Wurmfer. This J
.event appears by no means improbable, when we
tfonfider, that the Austrian aimy in th<f Tyrolefe (
isconitantly reinforced by frefh troops from the em- |
peror's hereditary dominions, who are sent for- t
ward iâ waggons, in order to expedite their pro- ,
grefs. We may hope that this army will foot, be t
in a llate lo ad offenfively ; and to retake the whole" t
