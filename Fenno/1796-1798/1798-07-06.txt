HOUÂ§E OF RBPRESENTATIVES.
Thursday, June 14-
MR, J. PARKER afk-d and obtained
leave of ablence for three weeks ;
Mr. Dennis for two weeks ; and Mr.
Mjoxg.an 'or the remainder of the session.
Mr. Thatcher called up the resolution
which he some time aiÂ»o laid upon the tale,
â¢diredling the P ;(lnull;r General to prepare
and report at the next session. such as fyf-
Astn aÂ» .1i 11 in one all the law he e.
â¢jofore puffed on the fubjeift of P.i'f Office
and Post Roads, adding to his report such
Btber new roads as he thinks it wr.uld be rx
ptdic-nt to eltablifh, which v as agreed to.
Mr. T. then moved to refer all the peti
tions which had been presented to the house
on this fubjeft tÂ» the Poftmaller-General,
which was alto a greed to.
The hrvuTp. on motion, refoked itfelf in
to a ronmittee of the whole on the bill
providing ar ns for the militia throughout the
United States, M>". SiTGaKAViis in the
chair ; when
Mi, Coit not feeing any necessity si r paf
firg this bill, ipoyed. to lliike cut the fir ft
fc<3;ofl.
Mr. Dayton (the Speaker) could not
Â£'ve his affeftt to the firlt fedlion and wus ra
lUer in lavour of l)/ikiiig it out, because it
would be fouud in prailice very WCO'lVlnirrit
for the' United Statti to become the retail
ers of ar t s to the ext n- therein propoferi.
He called up*in gentlemen to refledl for a
moment upon the espcncÂ«; of tranfporti'ig
them to every division of the militia, which
i i many cases would require a land car
of two or three hundred miles. And let it
be also taken into conlideratien ow many of
the nmiketi mud he injured materially by
such transportation and rendered utterly un
fit for service until repaired. Armourers
must therefore be sent with every par el of
arms into the inttrior of the United States,
and held in conltant pay not merely to re
pair the damages fult.iined l>y transportation,
bat to expofc them frequently to the air, and
to keep them free from rust to which they
p-oft bc c9jiiUat..y exeof<4. It they (hould
be scattered abroad in parcel) throughout
the country, as this feftion required, it was
very uncertain whether the militia would
buy the with the additional expense
laid on them for ttanfp nation, and thole
thus unfold would consequently be useless
both to th. public and individuals, or mull
after some time be brought back to the pub
lie armories with an experce eqml to their
firil cost. The plan contained in the firll
feftion was therefore the worlt that could be
proposed, ai d ought to be eflentially altered
or struck out.
Mr. M'DovfSLL hoped the feftion would
not be struck out. He fupnofed it mult be
the wifhof every gentleman that she militia
th oughcitlt the country fliould be well arm
ed. In foir.e parts otthc union it is well known
that this is not (he c.'fe at preftnt. and some
prorilioo ought to be ipade for supplying the
deficiency. Ihe gent e-nanf 1 oiji New-Jei
_fey had said, that tbe states individuals!
ought thcmfelves to. procure aims from the
manufaftureÂ« ; but in those pa'ts of the
country where these arms arc chiefly wanted,
there at no manufactories from which they
caa be purchased ; therefore it vcu'd be
well for the government to undertake to J
supply them. The expence of tra>fporta
tion by land wonld certainly be great ; a d J
it <Â»ght to be encountered ; because, f it is
not dene in the firll instance, if the ftrvice
of the militia is wanted, they mgft have arrcn
sent to them, where arm? are wa' ting. Be
sides, the expence of tranfpoitatinn would
be added t 'the price of the arms. As'o
the difficulty which would .attend th- keep
ing of arms in old er,though it would be at
tended with some trouble, he cotild not think
it would be so great as it had been re pre -
fented.
Mr. 'Shipard said, the committee who
reported this bill, werejndueed to it from a
persuasion that the Southern states are in
want of arms, and have not an opportunity
nf furchafing them. In the eastern states,
Mr. S. Â£atd, they had fufficient manu rafto
ries of arms, from whuice government might
purchase, and furtjifh th: desired supply.
The committee did not forget the yic: nve
â¢oienqes mentioned by the gentleman from
N. Jersey; but, notwithstanding these, they
were of opiison, government to un
Â«Â«Jertake the t ufm-.fs, especially since it would
ifce-attended with little or no expence in the
*nd, as the money laid out (or lent for a
time) would be returned, when the arms
ihail be fold.
Mr. S. Smith frit some of the inconve
niences pointed cut by the gentleman from
New Jersey ; hut when it is recollected that
*ll the manufaftories of fr.all arm?, tithtr
are, or doubtl fs shortly will be engaged in
public service, the necessity and propriety of
-governments undertaking this bulinefs will
appear evident ; for, if it be desirable that
the mili ia (hculd be we'll a' ned. and :t un
doubtedly is -so. government ought to aid the
jjecple in the purchsfe. .Mr. S. asked what
was done in tbe late iofurreftion ? Une part
-of the militia called upon were not com
pletely armed, a- d government was obliged'
-to Transport arms tram the arsenals of the
United.States ; and it would surely be.ber
ter to do this Â« hijlt we a,re at peace, th?n
af;tr we.shall be engaged in war, efpecjally
as. the pÂ«ople .wquld new purchase ihetr own
ar.rsr., hut if Jiey were fypplied by guvetn
m>;i"t, iin a safe of emcrgenqy, it wou'd be
at public tipenee. Mr. S. wa. ihertfore
drctdedly in favour of the ireafore.

PHILADELPHIA: FRIDAY EVEN INC', JULY 6, 1798
Mr. Harrison said, that a little while
go, itwaj dangetous for gentl;men to Ipeak
about saving expence, as any man who did
so, w*s immediately charged with wilhing
to give up his country to a foreign enemy ;
but row when a plan is on foot to supply
the southern states with a'ms, though no et
pence will eventually attend it, a lnud cry
i> made a'/ainft the expence which will be in
curred Tho' gentlemen are pcrfeflly willing
to incur the expence of a llandirg army they
are unwilling to tifkafmall 1 fs which mayac
crue fromcarryingint effe&the pr posed mea
sure for supplying such of the mil tia as want
them with arms, For what purpose are
these arms wanted ? For the defence of the
liberty and indepeudence of the country j
and yit gentlemen now speak of expence.
At the prcfent crifu of danger, and when all
alow that the southern llatcs, are most like
ly to t> e attacked, and the militia of those
states wan' arms, and .ifked f r them, whe
it ii> propolcd to accommodate them in pro
curing them, expence is held up as an ob
jtfiioi'. He trulled, when gentlemen consi
dered the fituatiou of the southern states. and
that they contain within their ojvn bosom a
dangerous enemy, they will not periift in
their oppofit'os to a measure calculated to
remedy this defedl ; that they will not ex
hibit to the world a strange tnconfiilency
in a free country, viz', t the general
government infills upon fending hired (land
ing troops into the ftates, against
th will of the people, but at the fame time
refufes to give them an opportunity of ,iur
chafng arms for t'neir own defence !
Mr. Harper believed, that most, if
all of the inconveniences let forth by the
gentleman from New Jersey, might be a
veided, and the objeft of the bill attained.
These we e fjppol'ed to arife
chiefly from a lengrhy transportation of these
a ms by laiid. Whatever inconvenience and
loss, however, might attend this supply, he j
thought with the gentleman fr m Maryland, .
that the difficulty ought to be encoun ered '
now, rather than in a Hate of war. Biefides,
if this supply is withheld until the arm* arc
wanted, the fame inconvenience would not
only be tncountertd, tut the arms would
come too late for the people to use them in j
training. But are we, said Mr. H. obliged :
to incur the expence of land-carriage ? He
believed not, except in very few infta?ces.
Let it be recolle&ed, that every Hate, except
two, borders upon the sea, and that Ihey
are all penetrated by rivers, which are to a
certain degree navigable by boatÃ ; and if
these arms were sent i to some town in every
ft te, where the people could get supplied,
though they might have to ride 50 or 100
miles for the fnpply, they could readily de- 1
pute a person to go and make a purclmfe of ;
all that might be wanted in a neighbour- !
hood. There ware, to be sure, a few excep
tions, in which cases the expence of land car
riage mull be incurred.
Mr. Dayton said that if the motion to
j strike out the 2 4 fcflion was withdrawn, lie
(hould nut objeft to their proceeding with
the bill, and endeavouring to majce it as un
exceptionable as pofiiblr. lie had fyecn op
[x fed Jo the general prejeft of it betaufe he
bel eÂ»ed it would rather prevent than pro
mote the general arming of the militia, and
would remove from use, ai well as put out
of repair many thousand (lands of the public
arms. Mr. Dayton declared that he was
not wi ling to do more than to authorize
the encreafe ot the number of armories and
arsenals (o that th re might be one in every
(late, wheie i might be deemed fafe and
practicable. He hope I that each (late would
take meafurrs to purchase arms for heir citi
zen*. It was known that t.ke United Stales
had no surplus of this important instrument
of wa', but on the contrary were deficient.
Mr. H arpE.R kne-.v that the feftion as it
(lands, wilhout amendment, would produce
great inconvenience ; but he also kpew that
this feftion is capable of a very simple a
mendment which would briiig the bill to
what the gentleman from New jersey wifli
ed.
Mr. Coit withdraw his motion.
Mr. S. Smith mov d to strike out the
word?, " in due proportion," which wa3 im
mediately a . reed to.
Mr. HA k pm. moved to strike out the
words " within each div fion of the militia
of the date."
Mr. Varnum wi/hed a division of the
question.
Mr. Rutlrdgf. faid,as f<me of theAates
could easily supply thetnfelves, they did not,
of cour/e, (land in need of the aflillance of
government i though in other states where
arms cannot be got, It v ili be proper to fend
them. In the (late from which he came
(S. Carolina) though the citizens in the
lowej- part of the couqt y ate well aimed,
the inhabitants of the back country are in
want of a rails, an J in otder to funv.lh a sup
ply for that par of the country, the legis
lature of that (late h?d appropriated a sum
of money for the purchase of 10,000 (lands
,0! arms. '1 his money now lies in the trea
sury, and if the general tovernment couli
fend this quantity of arms to that date, they
.would be immediately . for. He had
Himlelf applied to the executive department
on account of these arms, but had received
for a-fiver, that though government had
arms in their arsenals, they had no authority
to fell them, but it thi3 law pasTed, they
might be forwarded.
Mr. R. said, if the Un ted States were
j.afked to supply "(le Militia, at their own ex
p nee wi h arms, some i-bjeftion might te
1 m?de to the requefl : but ?sthey
] lequefted to be i' llrumental in afFjrJinij the
I fuppjy, wilhout beaii-ig ultimately any pa t
of the expeoce, Ve thought the proposition
could not re if x-.ably be objefted'to.
Mi". Varnum d'd not believe that the
Militia of any of the State? are com tetely
armed ; and many of the arms which they
have are of different < alibres. I-i the flat**
of MafiTachufetts he believed th fe pevfons
who had not proper arms could not get them.
He hoped, therefore, the arms would be
dillributed amnnt the several dates.
Mr. Brooks did not think t'x gen'lemtsn
from Maflachufetts had any reason to be ui>-
easy on his fubjeft. If the words are Article .
ont, th* Prsfident would douutl fs dillribute
them where they are mod wanted, and
where the people will be willing to purrhafe
them.
Mr. Macon said, 'h"t he had r.ippofed,
since he words " due proportion," we>e
struck out, that the words now moved to be
dispensed with, would have g onÂ£ O| H !
course. This, he said, was one of those !
kind of b lis which are calculated to benefit
the whole union* Those states which manu
fa'lyre arms, wil he benefited by the sale ot
them to, other states which want them, and
they will be benefited by the supply. There
was very lit;l; chance of the Hate of North-
Carolina, from whence he came, bejng in
vaded ; but if either o! the neighbouring
states were'attacked, he ftippofed the people
of his (late would be called upon for aflifl
ance, a'd when they were so called upon,
he was de' rous that they fiiou'.d be Well
armed, and ready to obey I he call.
Questions oa both parts of the.itnendment
were put and carried.
Mr. S. Smith wiftied, from what had
fallen from the gentleman from S. Carolina
(Mr. RuTLEpnt) to strike out the word
" out," and to insert " to the government ef
the refpeUhefates, or."
Mr. Thatcher did not know why the
General Government Qiould be put to the
trouble ttnd expefce of pro"iding arms for
the State Governments. The original ob
jefl was to provide arms for such individuals
of States chufe to purchase
them and he thought that objift ought not
to be extended to th.* State Governments.
Mr. T Claiborne said, the gentleman
from MaffacbuGetts must have a vety fertile
imagination, indeed, if he could suppose
that the State Governments could wa r t arms
for any other purpose besides that of distri
buting amongfl the people, and at this time
he thought it proper that armslhould be put
into the hands of the people, and that those
who are not able to pay for them, should
have thÂ«m given to them.
Mr. Bayard hoped this amendment would
be agre~d to. The obj'fl of the bill was to
place arms in the hands of those who want
them, and this objift wijvlia be accomplished
whether they arcs fold to individuals, or to
the State Ooverdments If gentlemen fap
pofed the governments of the states could
readilv get fuppiied. the are miftak^n.â
He could speak with certainty as to the
fta'e from which he came. He knew money
had been appropriated for purchasing arms
fÂ«r their quota of the Militia. He knew the
governor of that fta'e came to this city to
endeavour to make a contrail for tbefr terms,
but he found all were engaged for thf go
vernment of the United States, and the
money yet lies in the Treafnryof t,h.e State.
He .boned, therefore, no farther oppefitjon
would b- made to it.
Mr. ICittera said, the ftafe of Penr
f' lvani i had a propriated money for 20,000
(land of arms ; one half to be purchaser
within the United Stages, and the other had
to be .imported. Those which were ordered
to be pnrchafed within the United .Stater,
had been purchased ; Jjut the qon'<"as?
abroad, he believed, had failed, and he b,e
lieved the State Government is (inxtqya to
complete the order.
Mr. Thatcher said, he did not pppofe
the amendment because he wilhed to prevent
the State Governments from purchasing ai ; y
quantity of arms they p eased. J*ut he did
not thijjk this was the bed way of bringing
arms into the hands of the people. He
thought the State Governments ipigbt as
well go to the manufacturers, or fend thejr
orders abroad themftlves s,s ettploy the Ge
neral Government to do the business for
them.
The queflion was put and carried without
a division.
Mr D victon proposed a new feÂ£ti<jn
authorising thi. President in cafe all fir any
part of the .arms remain unfold, to cause
them to be delivered to such <>f the..militia
a? may want them when called into actual
service, proper receipts and fec'jr,ities beisg
taken for returning the fame.
It was carried 57 votes being f?r it.
The question <in filling, the blank contain
ing the number of arms to be provided, be
ing under consideration,
Mr. Harper hpped it woujd be Oiled ,
with 1.00.000 itaads. He thbiyjjit that
number m ght be well dillnbuted through
ont the United States. They were to serve
a doubli purpose, jc would be recoiletted,
vix. they ire not only 'o be fold, but to arm
fuqh of t'tc militia as may stand in need of
them whenever they (hall be called into ac
tual service.
Mr. Rut(,e.hc2 thought this woiild be by
far too large a nomber ; they would require
more money than could be well fparqd for
the purpose ; they would qoft. from 14 to
16,000 dollars. He bejieved 30,000 (lands
would f)e fufficient.
Mr. T. Claiborne thought zj or 30,000
would be enough- ' 1
Mr. Otis qfyfiion; that if such a
j n r w. s Prefidtntof
! the United States was to apply
the money received from thole which are un
fold, in purchasing a frefh quantity, so as
to keep the sum now appropriated as a fund
to be conftanily employed in the purchase of
arrm, until the peoole in all part 3 of the
anion (hall be well fupplnd with them, the
provision would be fufficient.
Mr. Kittera wis against 100,000. He
believed .hat number would cost little less
than two millions of dollars.
Mr. Harper withdrew his motion for
100,000, and the fenfeof the hÂ»uie was ta
ken on jo,ooo and negatived, lhÂ»re being
only zo votes for it. 30,000 were then
moved and carried 44 to 28.
Mr. Shepard believed ihey might be
pnrchafeJ for twelve dollars a (land, and
therefore moved to fill the blank to contain
the sum propefed to be applied for the pur
chafe of those arms, 400,000 dollars.âA
greed.
Mr. Otis made a mot on to carry his pur
pose into effeft, of having this sum csnftant
ly employed as a fund for the puicliafe of
arms.
It was negatived, there being only 20
votes for it.
The committee then rose, and the house
took up the amendmen s. Coming to the
new feftion,
Mr. S. Smith conld fee no occasion for
this feftion, as there ivaÂ» a similar one intro,
duced in the law for railing a Provisional
Army.
Mr. Harper f id, there was cunfidera
ble difference betwixt this feftion, and the
one allude 1 to in a former aft- By that
provision the arms couid not he delivered to
the people unless required by the Governor
of a State ; and it might happen that the
President would thjnk it nectffary to call out
the Militi', when the Governor of fame
particular State might not think it ueceffary.
When the Volunteers are in want ol arms,
the President is authorized to supply them
on reque't of the Volunteers ; but, with
refpeft to the Militia, the < oncurrent autho
rity of the Governor of a State is necessary
Mr. H. thought this a defeft in the law
which ouijht to be remedied.
Mr. Kittera fnggeftcd the propriety of
re-committing this bill, in order to giv>- the
Speaker, who was the author of this feftion,
n opportunity f speaking in reply to the
observations urged against it.
The motion was negatived 42 to 28.
Mr. Edmond said, heunderftood the ob
jeft of this bill o be to provide arms to be
fold out to such individuals or (late govern
ment!, as chufe to become purchafen, by
placing them in convenient situations in the
different Sates , but, if th s feflion is in
troduced into the bill, it will operate a a
jljifcouragement to the purchase of these arms,
because when State Goversrtents and Indi
viduals fee that if they'Ho not purchase arms
for themselves, they will in cafe of necessity,
have them put into the hands of those who
want them, they will not of course be very
eiger to pnrchafe, and the arms will lie un
disposed of at the rilk and loss of the United
States.
Mr. Sitgreavks said, an objeftion had
been brought against this bill, which he .
thought had some weight, viz. that though
these arms were proposed to be fold, there
was no obligation upon the people to pur
chase the 01, and therefore a clause ought to
be introflr.c;d for placing such arms as may
remain in any part of the country unfold, in
the hanjs of the .people, in cafe of emergen
cy. For this purpose, this clause had been
introduced in the committee of he whole.
Mr. S. said, the idea of the gentleman from
S. Carolina war. a eorrrft one, that, with
out this clause, the President of the United
States could only dilpofe of these arms by
sale. However urgent an occ fion might a
rise, he cauld not p t them into the hands
ps the Miliiia, without the concurrence
of the Executive of a States ; and he
believed, if gentlemen wiflied this bill to pass
at all, it would be necessary to have thin
clause inserted.
Mr. R. Williams was in favour of re
tailing the clause.
Mr Edmond again expressed his opinion
against the feftion.
After a few words in favour of the clause
from Mr. Craik, the quell ion was put and
carried, there being 54 votes tor it
Mr. moved to rike out the fal
lowing words, " w/frc/j Jball bt depoftlttl at
juitalic placet. ' Ht thought them very
vague. They.might mean foi'able. for fafe
keeping, or fuitabie for I'al \. If'tbey meant
that the arms should be placed in fuitabie
places for fa'e in every (late, ke (hould be
oppo'ed to it. He did not wi(H to have
thtfe arms sent all over the Union, but to
have them left at the disposal of the Prefi
d-nt. The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.
lj)avis) tor instance, could not with to have
them sent there, because his constituents,
according to his own account, are not able
to purchase them.
The Speaker ueclared this oiction out
of order.
Mr. Allen then moved to add the words,
'' Jor fafe keeping."
Mr. Harper was sorry the gentleman
from Conncfticut (hould qua rel with the
bill, because it was propolcd to accommo
date the purchasers of these arms as much
ai possible. Ht thought the bill was found
ed altogether on this g-oind of aecomrao
d-tion; and as the Prefideut would now
have the disposal of the arms according to
his own discretion, bethought the bill stood
very well at prelent.
Mr. Allun withdrew his motion, and
the bill was ordered to ergiofTVd for a
third reading.
['Volume XIV.
â oy. Toe house accordingly resolved itfelf
into a committee o! the whole on that bill}
when
Mr. Shfpaud moved to strike out the
firfl feftion of the bill, >
Mr. M'Dowell fVconded the motion*
It was one he was himfclf prepared to have
Mi adj. lie thought the hill highly except
tionable. Jt is provide !by this bill that the
Volunteers fiioll not be fubjeÂ£l to the militia
traiaing which the States have a right to
put them under. If these volunteers are,
indeed, to be considered as a Standing Ar
my, then they are free from tht authority of
the States ; but if they are not to be thus
consider d. to e*cufc them from militia train
ing, would be an interference wirh ft ate au
thority which was altogether unallowable,
and would have a tendercy to destroy t!ie
miiitia, which had hitherto always been con*
fidcred as the sure defence of the country.
Tp excr.f? these volunteers from Militia Du
ty, would also create a diltin&ion between
them and the militia which he was appre
hen five would produce the most unhappy ef.-
feds,
Mr. S.Smith said, if he could consider
tl)ef<r volunteers as pjrt of the militia of the
United Stales, lie fliould agree in opinion
with the gentleman last up ; but he confi W
red them not as a part o * the militia, but as
reguhr troops, to do regular service
fcsr two years, after they are accepted by the
Prrfidenf. Surely, then, whilst men stand
thus pledged for the \ uhlic fervicf!, it would
be very unreasonable indeed, to call r.pon
them to do mib'tia duty, and fine them for
the negie6l of doing it (for they could Wot
perform both ferviccs )
Mr. Sew a ll remarked, that these Volun
teers, though they would not be fubjecf ft#
the Articles of Waruntil they came into actu
al service, would neverthlefs, according toÂ»
this bill, be fubjett to rules and regulations to>
be cftablidied by the President, which he sup
posed would be founded upon the Articles of
War. It must, therefore, app-ear 10 be rea-<
fonable to excuse them from Militia Duty.
Mr. $h epArd objeded to this clause, be
cause, in the firft place it makes a call to the
whole of the Militia to come forward and
make an offer of their service to the President
of the U. States, which if complied with to
any extent, would have the effect of destroy
ing altogetherthe State authority with refpeit
to the Militia, and would convert the whole
into a Standing Army, and consequently vio
late the Constitution. If the law could be soÂ»
modified as to be made agreeable to the Con
ftitutioir, he fliould not objedt to it ; but at'
present, he thought it in direst violation oÂ£
that provision which lays, the training of tho
Militia fliall be left to the Individual States*
For this Hill proposes that these men diall be
called by another name, taken from iheir old
Officers, and placed under such as shall be ap
pointed by the President of the United
and its certain effett must be to create difuni
-011 betwixt the States anj} the Unfted States-
Mr. Harper said, that gentlemen who
spoke against this bill, had taken an errone
ous view of the fubjed. They spoke as if
these Volunteers were to be excused from ser
vice, wheraas they will be sub-jest to much
severer exercise than the Militia, not only
when called into actual service, but in the
mean time, and they will therefore undergo *
more rigid difciplinc than ever the Militi.iare
called to. They ought certainly, therefore*
to be exempted from Militia duty.
Besides, Mr. H. said, he looked upon these
corps as a much better defence than the ordi
nary Militia cculd afford ; and those gentle
men who spoke of the Militia as being a fuf
ficient defence for the country, he would re
fer to the fate of the canton ot Berne, from
which they wilJ find that fomeching more
than spirit and bravery is necessary. 11 will be
seen that nothing can be effected without dif
crpline, for though the people of Bern, affiled
by their wives and fitters defended themselves
bravely with their Scythes aod Pitchforks*
they were mowndowniby the fuperiordifcip
line and order of the enemy. So that for want
of energy and decision in their Government,
and discipline in their troops, they were
crushed nnd rfettroyed. This example he
thought so flrikingly in point, that he was
aftoi.ifhed any gentleman should oe found
here to advocate (imiiar temporising measures.
Mr. il. had no doubt that our Militia are as
brave a fct of men as any in the world ; but
courage alone will rÂ»ot avail; undisciplined
courage placed against veteran troops, as in the
instance just mentioned, would be certain to
fail ; it would only give tbe enemy the trou
ble of killing fijeh a force, and filling the
ditches with their dead oodies. In proportion,
therefore, as you impart to the people di(-
cipline, organization, command, and military
habits, you produce an efleCtaal defence for
the country. It was on this account that he
was so favourably impreUetfc with refpett to
the volunteers, and that lie advocated the
present bill.
Mr. Macoi wiflied the gentleman from
S. Carolina had examined the constitutional
queflion, infteadof referring the house to the
fate of Berne. Whatever energy it might be
necessary to exert, it ought to be exerted ac
cording to the conftitutien. He thought the
present bill a direct violation of it. If these
volunteers are regulars, there is no occasion
for this clause, as the state cannot call upon
regular soldiers, to d.o militia duty, so that
this law, and the committee who formed it,
must have considered them as a part of the
Militia. This, Mr. M. said was the fame
question which was formerly under discussion,
on the original bill ; and he had npt altered
his opinion of its unconftitutional'ity.
Mr. ShepaTvD said, this bill'was not only
unconstitutional, fyut would create much un
eafuiefs and disturbance in the country. He
could not but be much obliged to the gen
tleman from S. Carolina (Mr. Harper) for his
lecture on Military Duty ; bnt he believed he
(Mr. S. had forgotten more vhan that gentle
man ever knew, and therefore did not want
his instructions. He believed the Militia are
in general much better trained and disciplined
than they would be in the form of Volunteers Â±
but it feemcd as if no .man could be a good
Officer, unless he receivedhiscommiffion from
the President. He saw no foundation forfuc.i
an idea.
Mr. Bayard said, whatever name is given
to these Volunteer Cor v >s, whether thsy fluUbÂ° rafted regu' it troops* ornc'. there can:iof
mÂ« Â» :, e 1 th.j fik v arÂ«- no". Â«o be coi !i

he ~â¢> directed rÂ». appoint the officers, and the
Constitution 1$ pcfitive, that -he oHTicers of
â¢hr I .iiHa caanto be appouned, other than
by the States.
Mr. lap posed the gentleman from N.
Carolina (Mr. Mac on) a: ci not mean to fay
that the Legislature of the U. States could not
c -v.'-' <>vÂ» 1 pcuons 0111 a performance of Mili
tia duty- A nroiof *0 the contrary might be
found in the Mi'itiaiaw. It was clear, there
fore, thai the houie had a right to excuse vo-
fro.nmil t.a duly, aiÂ»d the onlyqitff
tiou \Â» ;Â».s as to the reafonablenefsand proprie
ty cf do :â Â£ so ; and lie thought this mull be
vrrv evident from t!-.e vmpofllbility there
be of their complying with both laws.
Mr. Karpkr wished to add one word in
reply to what had fallen from the gentleman
from M:iflachufetrs, in relation to hunielf.â
That genrieman, whom he knew held a consi
derable military fommatu', ivfufthaforgotten
more urinary knowledge ihan he ever knew,
beca fe he never knew any ; and hecaufe that
gentleman leemed to poifefs but little at vre
feiit; but he did not know that it was neces
sary to have a pfaotical knowledge of milita
ry affairs, to dcternurie that nothing can be
done by way of defence, without discipline.
He believed Jte-.might form as correct an opi
nion on that-point as if he wefe possessed of all
the military knowledge which that gentleman
favs he hai forgotten
Mr. G a T.LATIN observed, there was one
point 'ot v.eiv in wliich this subjeCt hud not
been conlidered. IJ he-underflood the law
which had been passed on this fubjcCt, his
ideas wefe tlie fain'? vvith refpeef to the Volun
teers, with those of the gentlemen from De
laware and Maryland, viz. not that they are a
part of the Militia, but a part of the arruy of
the United States; for, if they haJ beencon
fidered as a part ot the Militia, the law would
have been unconttitiitional, by giving the
or appointingoifiv.ers to the Prekdent,
initead of it to the several (fates as
the conititu-ion duetts. He therefore consi
dered that point as decided, viz. that these
volunteers are u part oi rhe army of the Unit
ed States; but the fe6\ion now under confi
de ratio*n goes to declare that such of tlie Vo
lunteers-as fhafl submit to certain rules ot dif
tipline, shall be exempt from Militia duty,
and therefore such as lhall not chufe to fub
n it so these rules, are to be ccnfidered as lia
ble io do militia duty. In that it was
perfectly inconfjftent with the bill passed. lie
conceived that the moment a person enlirted
h ; ir feif as a volunteer, he was exempt from
Militia duty.
T his bill, he underrtood, had been intro
duced to rectify a defect in the original'law.
A yreÂ«t de:il had been said about the great ef
fect of difopline, and' of the fate of Berne,
w!>.ich he r!iouÂ»ht wholly irrevelant. ' When
% lie original bill was formerly under coniider
ation, U Was objected agaii\!t it that it did not
provide fufficient regulations for the govern
ment of corps. This is found now to be
the cafe, and the deficiency is now prepofed
to be flip plied, liow is this to be done ? By
Submitting to such rules and regulations as
the President (hall appoint, or if volunteers
rinN neglett to do it, they are to be (Ã¼bjeÂ£t to
fnilitra duty. He neither thought this right or
proper. He thought it ought to be made po
iitive that the volunteers (hould conform to
the rules laid down by 'he President, instead
â cf leaving the matter at large ; for having
once determined the volunteers to be ftand
inÂ£ troops, by authorizing the President to ap
point the ofircers, they cannot any longer be
conlidered'as at all appertaining to the mili
ti.i. '1 he ft'vtion ought, therefore, either to
be .uneiided or rejected.
Mr. Dana thought the fe6tion stood very
well a present. Every volunteer, whilst he
remained such, mult according to this bill,
conlcr.n lo the regulations Of the President.
Gentlemen Hill brought up the-queftion as to
what these corps ought to be called. They
might call them what they pleaied, Mr. D.
(aid, if they did not call them " an army
which will tlee before the enemies of their
country." Aj to the volunteers performing
the dury of militia men, as well as the duty of
their own corps, it would be utterly impofij
"ble to do it ; but if any volunteer declined
comply ii>g with the regulations laid dpwn by
the President for-heir government, he would
be turned back to the militia ; for it was not
intended that any volunteer (hould perform a
grudging fcrvic?;
Pvir. S. Smtt-i hoped the fettion would not
fce (truck out, but that it would be amended
in the way pro posed by the gentleman from
Pennfyivania.
Mr. Vaiinum thought Hie objections to
this seCtion might be removed by an amend
ment in the way proposed. The objections
made by his colleague (Mr. Shephard) and
other gentlemen, would haye been very pro
per when the original bill wa's under conside
ration; but at present he did not think they
were applicable. He had himfelf at that time
objeeled to this corps; but as it had been a
greed to, and as it would be looked upon in no
ether light than as (landing troops, and troops
too which would be firlt called upon in cafe
of any emergency, it would be wholly incon
sistent to make them liable to Militia duty.
The question on {hiking out was put and nega
tived 46 to 26.
The question now came upon the proportion
fcr loaning arms to the Volunteers, when
Mr. G. l latin said, it had beeu provided by the
law for raifuigOtt Provisional Army) that in cafe any
of the Volunteers lhall be called into service, before
they get poffeflion of arms, the President is autho
rised to loan to them field artillery, arms and ac
coutrements; but the provision in this bill proposes
that these arms may be loaned for the purpole of
training. This he did not think prudent, as it
would operate as a discouragement to the purchase
of arms by the volunteers themselves, and prevent
the country from receiving that cheap defence from
the service of these volunteers, which gentlemen
had foretold. He believed it would be fufficient to
loan arms to such of these volunteers as may want
them, when called into a<Slual service. Mr. G.
therefore moved to (Irike out the words which pro
posed this loan of arms.
Mr. S. Smith said, the obje&ion of the gentle
man from Pennfyivania had some weight; but he
believed it might be remedied by confining the
of arms to field pieces; and he believed that volun
teers would generally wifii to find their own mus
kets.
Mr. Gallatin varied his motion to meet the
ideas of the gentleman lad up.
Mr. Dayton moved that the committee might
rife. He found a compromise taking place betwixt
gentlemen which he did not approve. He thought
there might be young men v. ho wbuld turn out as
volunteers, who not afford to purchase their
own arms; and in such cafe he would have arms
given to them, tfelioped, therefore, a little time
would be given to consider this fubjedt.
The comniittee role accordingly, and had leave to
Si again. A did.

' MR. fiCNNO,
Ynu will oblige me by publifiing iu
' your paper tlit answer of the President of
the ( pited States, to the ad.dress of four
companies of militia of Marris county, in
' Nc w.Jerfcy.
j The infamous addiefs which appeared in
the Aurora a few days ago (to the honor
of ihat truly federal slate) was confined to
the lour companies with whom it originated.
It went fully to prove, that the acknow
ledgment contained in the no'le address ot
the commander in chief, general, and field
officers, " that there were a few deluded
and a few degraded characters amonft them,"
wag founded in truth. It is but j nil ice
the fi>ld;ers of those companies, to apply the
firft epitbet to them. Their officers merit
the lafl.
A Jersey-man.
To the Officers and Soldiers of the four Com
panies of Militia of Morris county, fiate of
New-Jersey.
gentlemen,
I HAVE received your address of the
4th of June, and am sorry to perceive any
(hades of difference in the fentim. Nts of the,
New-Jersey militia.
Although you cannot fay all that your
superiors have said, yet I rejoice that in
point of sincerity 3nd attachment to the
real incereft of your country, you yield to
none, and that whei) you are constitution
ally and legally called, yoti will not shun the
pod of danger, por be tardy in defending
your rights and privileges when invaded by
a foreign enemy, or attacked under any dis
guise whatever by a domestic foe. I hope
you will never dare to place any maH above
the constitution and laws of your country.
Nothing human is absolutely perfedl
the voice of adulation has never founded in
the ears of the Executive Magiltrates an
universal approbation ; if it had, there have
been psmphlets and newspapers, private
societies and resolves enough, as well as de
bates in the national legiflaturts, to convince
any man to the contrary.
Had not the meafuresbeeu adoptsd, which
you have observed, we (hould have been in
circumstances much more calamitous. I
believe very much mistaken when
you suppose, that " l'nterefted commercial
cha'' afters," joined with those whose politi
cal principles were rot " friendly to a re
publican form of government, have led the
way to our present embarrassment." You
(hould remember, however, that there are
" intereftid commercial charafters," as well
as p rfons, whose political principles are
not friendly to our present form of republi
can government, who have urged hard to
plunge us into the horrors of a war with a
nation the most abl: to annoyus, and to forcfc
us into the arms of anoiher whose form of
government- and administration are abhor
rent io our own. It is our wisdom to frm
no connection with any foreign power that
(hall influence our form of government.
If America and any other nation fhduld
lnve a common enemy, and (hould concert
measures together tor the present conjunc
ture for mutual benefit, there need be no
danger of ouradopting their peculiaiities of
government, any more than their adopting
ours ; I believe their fears on this head will
be ftrortger than ours, and perhaps better
founded.
Your government is I hope, to be
called a party ; if a government of your
choice is a party, how can you obtain one
which will not be so > I know of but two
ways, either to make it hereditary, or to
place yourselves under a foreign mil tary
despotism. You will start with horror at
the last, and I prefnme have no inclination
to the firft.
You are very much mifinforined if you
suppose the government embraces and car
rafies all those charafters, who were ever
your word enemies. Although it protests
all men to the utmoll of its power, who
are not inimical, it embraces only such cha
rafters as are faithful to the con dilution and
the laws, their execution and impartial in
terpretation ; it ftudles, however, not to so.
ment, or irritate, or perpetuate ancient pre
judices, and malignant passions, which had
better be difmiflcd.
Your insinuation concerning speculators
on the soldiers pay, and the diftrefles con
comitant with war, requires some notice.
Who were the people who dep eciated the
soldiers pay ? Were they not those who
taught for dodtrine, the commandments of
wicked men?âviz. " Public fajth ought to
, be violatedâPublic credit ought to be de
(lroyÂ«dâthe public debt ought to be ex
punged." Were they not those who op.
posed every species of revenue under the
old confederation, by which the soldiers
pay could have been preserved from depre
ciation ? I regret to fee, in your address,
so many fragments of those old discontents,
jealousies, and murmurs, which once made
the citizens of New Jersey as tributary to
their neighboring states, as the Fienchnow
desire to make us all to them. As to specu
lation, if you can devise a mode to destroy
it, conlift nt with the liberty of the citizen,
and the security of property, J (hall be
obliged to ycu if you will communicate it
to me.
With sincere good will, and cordial wishes
for your, fatisfadion and contentment, I am
your friend,

Philadelphia, June 28th, 2798.
Bp his Excellency JOHN JAY,Esquire,
Governor of the State of New-York.
A PROCLAMATION.
WHEREAS the Government of the Uni
ted Sates, to whom the people there
(l.s.) os-have committed the exclusive di
rection of their National Affairs, has
been pleased to publifli for the information
of the citizens, divers important and alarm
ing events and tranfadlion6âfrom which it
appears,
That there ext'ft well founded apprehen
sions that the Direftois of the French Re
public have long formed, and are strenuous
ly pursuing a system of empire and aggran
dizement subversive of the National Rights
and Independence, not only of the greater
part of Europe, but also of the United
Statesâimposing upon them the necessity
of partaking in her wars, and of contribu
ting to her expense, :
Tint the cautious and neutral conduft
which the United States, and fcveral other
nations Lave observed towards that Repub
lic, has not been able to shield them from
the operation of that system : but on the
contrary, that complain: sagainft the United
States have been diligently fought and al
led/fd, and followed, not by friendly re
monstrances and conciliato;y overtures, but
by unnecessary and unmerited marks of con
tempt, and by injurious and repeated aggres
sions : >
Th_t the late and present President, both
of whom are eminently diftinguithed by up
rightness and fiticerity, have at two differ
ent periods sent Ministers, to that Repub
lic, with ample powers and special inftru<ai
ons to ao theirutmolt endeavours to preserve
peace, and bring all differences to aa ami
cable conclusion, and on reasonable terms.
That notwithstanding the accustomed ref
peft which ciriliied andcontending nations
usually pay, as well as owe to each other,
and which requires thatambaffadors charged
with overtures for peace and conciliation,
thould at least be received and heard, and
treated wi h civility ; yet the firft of those
ministers was retufed to be admitted into the
prtfence of the said Direflors, and after
Angular delay and negltift, was dismissed in
a manner very disgusting to free, indepen
dent and friendly people :
That although the refpeft which every
Nation owes to itfelf, strongly opposed the
policy of giving to those Dire&ors, anothtr
opportunity of again treating the United
States with similar indignity, yet an earned
and prevailing desire to maintain peace with
all nations, and particularly with the French
Republic, induced,ihe President to appoint
three Envoys extraordinary, felefted from
the three great Diftridls of the United
States, and tend them to France, with ample
powers and inttiudtions to treat in afrie* dly
manner with that Government, refpeftir.g
all differences <ind complaints, and to ac
commodate and fettle them on terms limited
only by the Honor, Independence and es
sential interests of the United States.
That notwithftan 'ing such ftroiij; desires,
proved by such tinequivocal and uncommon
efforts to preserve peace and friendthip with
that Republic, those envoys were not only
refufed to be received and accredited, but
new difficulties and freth obftaclcsto accom
modation were interpofed,bydemar.ds
no Nation ought to make, and to which no
Nation ought tofubmit.
These faÂ£ta and circumstances strongly
indicate designs and systems hotlile to our
Peace and Independence ; and in connexion
with the lÂ®Â»g continued, encreafing and ru
inous depredations on our commerce, afford
reason to cxpeft that a more op?n and deci
ded rupture will take place, the moment
that further delay fliallceafeto beconvenient.
And whereas fcveral of the more alarming;
of these events had not been publithed by
order-os the Government of the United
States, and in an authentic manner, until
after the adjournment of the last feflion of
the Legislature of this State : and it has
become prudent to take without delay such
measures relative to defence, as the present
exigency requires, and which cannot be'
feat, nably and fufficieotly provided for by
the United States, without the auxiliary ef
forts of th i State.
Wherefore, concurring in opinion with
many of our bett informed citizens, I think
it my duty to give to the Legislature of this
State, an eatly opportunity of taking these
important matters into ther fcrious confide-1
ration; and thereupon to do whatever may I
he proper and receflary in such au emergen
cy ; with firm reliance on the Divine pro
tection, and with inflexible r?fo!ntion never
to furrend' r their Independence, and pay
tribute to any Nation whatever.
I do therefore in pursuance of the autho
rity conllitntionally vrfted in me, hereby
summon- and require the members of the
Senate, arid also the members of the AfTem
bly o'f this State, to convene and meet in the
city Hall ofthe city of Albany, on theninth
day of August next, and this Proclamation
(which all the Printers of Gazettes in this
State are hereby desired forthwith to pub
lish in their Papers) is to be coflfidered as
due and fufficient notice.
Given under my Hand and the Privy I
Seal of the State, at the City of j
New York, on the second day of
July, in the year of our L rd one
thousand seven-hundred and nine
ty-eiglu, and in the twenty seCond
year of the Independence of the ;
United Slates of America.
JOHN JAY.
From the Commercial Ad*vertifer.
As I have not been in the habit of addrefiing
my fellow-citizens through the medium of a
newfpapcr, it may in the eitimation of (amc well
disposed persons â¢ e thought imprudent and pre
fumingthus to expose rriyfelf to the perfidy and
malice of the worst of men. Rut at a moment
like the present, when most of the governments
of Europe are shaken to their center, and all
the republics swallowed up by the devouring
monfterof modern Gaul ; when those defpica
hle tyrants threaten us with the fate of Venice,
and infamous aliens in the bosom of our country
(who have fled for refuge from tbe vengeance
of their own) boast their readiness to co-operate
in executing their diabolical intentions ; I pre
lume that moil of my countrymen will agree
with me, that it is not a time for ceremony, hut
prompt and nervous atflion. lmprefl'ed with
these ideas I am induced to state the following
fa<fts.
Some time in the month of [une, Dr. James
Smith called at my house, and on his leaving it,
took my hat and left his in the place of it ; the
next day I was ciretfed to call at John D.Burk's
printing-office, as the most likely place to find
him; I went to the office accordingly, and
whjjft there, a person called and informed Mr.
Burk that a certain bookseller in this city had
received a letter from his friend in Virginia, stat
ing that the French had effected their landing
in IrelandâBurk, with marks of much appro
bation, exclaimed, that he believed it was true,
and if so that he would not give a damn for the
Federal villains in this countryâÂ»that he believed
the French would come here, and he wished to
God they would, when every icoundrel in favor
of thitf government would be put to the guillo
tineâthat they had hinted that he would be sent
away as an alienâbut then he would let them
know who was the strongest party. The indig
nant reader will no doubt queryâ â¢
And is it possible that there are Americans so
infamous as to/an&ion declarations like these ?
I would answer yes, and we have abundant cause
to believe that among the number, are tohfe
legislative oppofers of a nervous and manly re
finance of the attacks of France upon our sove
reignty and independene. Narrow, contracted
and unprincipled must those minds be, which,
at this awful period con ad as if engaged in a
contest for place and power ; and which, instead
of proceeding upon the broad ground of con-
Hitutional vigilance, can descend to political
squabbles. contentions and broils, difhorjorable
to themselves, and difgracaful to the govern
ment. If by such conduit, we should be ulti
mately driven, which Heaven forbid ! to pur
chase oy a base f'acriiice of our honor and our
fafety, a short respite from hostility, the heavy
load of responsibility will cru(h rhem with its
weight, And the maledictions of society will
proclaim them the enemies of their country.â
Firmness, vigor ant! decision, have heretofore
formed the charaifleriftic features of Americans
in the hour of distress. Though the public
mind is, I fear in some degree, perverted, the
national chara&ei, I trust is not gone ; let us be
true to ourselves and we have nothing to fear ;
'out the man who when difficulties press and dan
gers surround, refufes to lend his support to the
iiate, is a miscreant that deserves te be reje&ed
from her bosom.
I cannot dismiss this fubjeÂ«Â£l without again
calling the reader's attention to the indignity of
fered to the mzjefly of the American people,
through the Cuief Magistrate in the following
paragraph, by that imported patriot, the un
principled John D. Burk, editor of the seditious
Time Piece i *
" When such a charafler attempts by anti
quated and expioded fophillry, by jcfuitical ar
guments t extinguiihthe sentiment of Liberty ;
TIS FIT the maflc (ho-ild be torn off from this
meaner species of Aristocracy than history has
condescended to record, where a person without
patriotifin, without philosophy, without a taste
for the fine arts, building his pretensions on a
gross and indigested compilation of statutes and
precedents is jojlled into the chief magiltracy
by the ominous combination of old Tories tuith
old opinions, and old IVbigs with new : TIS
FIT this mock M narch, with his court com
posed of tories and speculators, should pafi in

Monarchies are seen only with indignation and
concern; at fight of these terrible establishments 1
tears accompany the execrations of mankind ;

his serene court, is seen Jbliciting and anj"wering

not excited ; if to tears and execrations be not
added derision and contempt

ble for their difrrgard of religion, contempt of
laws and depravatien of morals have been listened
to with too much plcafure by many good men.
Distrust of lawful authority, abuse of honest cha
ra-flers and the propagation ot impious opinions
are the acknowledged means used by the French
gÂ»vernment to corrupt, divide and ruin us. The
calumniators of the meafuresof our .overnment,
and of our wisest and heft men, compose purt of
the diplomatic corps, of whose (kill the French go
vernment boast, an 1 who are to defeat the repre
sentations of our envoys and disarm the American
people, of their resentment. Can it be poflible,
that the mifcrcaot agents and admirers of France
will be aMe by mifreprefenthtien any longer to
mislead the people, whose independence and best
in.erells they have betrayed, afcer our envoys have
been told in piain terms, unless as much money
j be given as could be raised from the people, by
forced loans,l suppose ; that the diplomatic ikill of
.France and the means fhepoffefles in Â«this" coun
try ' were fufficient to enable her with the French
" party in America to throw the blame which
would attend the rupture of the negotiation on
" federalifts."âAfter this declaration by the gov
ernment of France, let not their partizans be lift
oncd to with patience, kut let them be pointed at
by the finger of scorn an traitors to their country.
Let no man be permitted, wi'h impunity, to abuse
the adminiflrarion of our government, or discre
dit its advocates with ( the people. Let the parti
zans of France, whose profane touch had almost
poisoned the fountain of representation, now meet
the frowns of an enlightened people who Bve too
long lowered on the best friends of the indepen
dence and honor of their country.

were read Irom, arid much said refpecVmg cer
tain public prill?s of this city (particularly
the Aurora). Tito motion on a.rejection of
the bii! was tak,e.n by yeas and nays, and ne
gatived 36 tg 47. The bill was then commit
dte for to-morrow.
Mr. ALa en laid a refoJution upon the ta- j
ole ;o the following effect:
u Resolved, That a committee be appoint
ed to cottfider upon the expediency of deelar â¢
ing, by a legislative aft, the state and relation
f ibfifting between the United States and the
French Republic." Ordered to lie on the â¢'
j table.
For ehe Caze'te of tie U.nlteJ Bidlest
'' YET forty days and Ni..eveTi fbaU be

ed by the whale.- And b cause i' pic a fed
God tofpare that " very great city" " Jo
nah was difp!eaf"d exceedingly, and-he was
very angry*'âangry even unto death, far
fays he '' take O Lord, T hefeeeb thee my
life from me, for it I*s better for ire to die
than to live." And thus it is with bur falfc..
prophets ; they have long foretold, what
they wish, the downfall rf our 'oveinmrnt,
and the introdu&ion of pure Jacobin prin
ciples and praÂ£t ; ce ; when the French (hall
give us complete liberty to cut one an
other's throat?. I fay because thefc dam
nable prophefuse pre r,ut fulfilled, thel'e J,v ;
cobin prophets are as mad as ever Jonah was ; j
and as foqlifhly Uubborn. .They wouldfoon- I
r give up their fir 11 born than their errors. '
They would ft e the United Statesenveloped j
in one general conflagration, rather than re
nounce these abominable French principles ;
notwithstanding they know that a lying fpi- j
rit has been sent forth to deceive them. If
'.hey cannot change and become true men,
ihey ought to have more spirit than to live
among us defpiCed as they now are. The
traitor Ahitbophel had more spunk. When
he found that his advice waa not followed, in
the affair of Absalom's rebellion against his
father, he could not brook the disgrace for
a moment. "He arose, and saddled his ass
and gat him home to his own country, and
put his household in order and hanged him
felf." This is doing business like a man j
who had a proper sense of his crime. And! !
who can tell but a noted modern counsellor
has now gat him home to put his household in
order, 6sV. If foâT would to God
all traitors would muster up courage enough
to follow his example : for certainly the
jullice of their country lingers. lam
