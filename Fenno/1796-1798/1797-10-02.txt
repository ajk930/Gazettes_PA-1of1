MR. fenvo,
In your paper of last evening, I read a
paragraph of furpriling mortality at the
house ps Job Whitall, at Red Bank : it 1
appears from the account there given, that
they all died on the 25th instant, which is
not correft, and at the house of Job Whit
inftead of James Whitall, which mistake
I think it proper to correft.âJames Whit
all's wife died the 22d instantâhis son Job
the 13th âgrandson the 19th âand grand
daughter, Sarah Whitall, the 20th, aged
19 years, whose early loss is deeply felt by
her numerous friends and acquaintance ; for
in her were centered, in an eminent degree,
all those virtues which ornament the fait sex.

Remarks of eminent persons on Temperance,&c.
Soon in the lufeious feaft themselves they loft,
And dra k oblivion of their native coafi ;
Instant her circling wand the Goddrfs waves,
To hogs transforms them, and the stye receives.
Cotvley. In proportion as luxury in
creased, the life of man was abbreviated :
the seven kings of Rome reigned longer
than the firft twenty emperors.
Addifon. It is said of Diogenes, that
meeting a young man who was going to a
fealt, he took him up in the street, as one
who was running into imminent danger,
had he not prevented him.
Anacharf.s. This celebrated Scythian
philosopher being alkÂ«;d how it was possible
a person might contrail a to wine,
answered, by beholding the indecencies of
the drunken.
Cicero. Temperance is the source of
great peace and tranquillity to men, for it
brings their desires and aversions under the
laws of reason.
Comoro. Of all parts of a feaft, that
which a man leaves does him the mot good.
Cadogan, m. d. However common it
may be for men that fuffer to complain of
the evils of life as the unavoidable lot of
humanity, they are the sole authors of their
mi (tries ; mod of them, however, he affirms
they acquire. All chronic diseases, molt
undoubtedly, men create by their own in
digencies ; nor will this physician allow of
hereditary gout.
Epicurus. Give me but bread and water,
and I will dispute the point of felicity with
Jupiter himfelf.
Hippocrates. If p man cat little and drink
little, he brings r.o deadly di order upon
himfelf.
Hoffman. Intemperance may properly be
turned the executioner of mankind, (gene
ris humani carn sex.)
Plato. To eat to faticty twite in one
day, and never to lleep alpneâThis is a
Way of life in which no psrfort vfill ever
become wife. .. ' Â» .
Price t m. d. The black catalogue of
diseases which ravage human life is the off
fpring of luxury and falfe refinements of
civil society, intemperance and debauchery
| lay the foundations of numberless fuffer
j ' n g 6 Â» and terminate in premature and mife
rablc deaths. t
1 Pythagoras. Dmnkennefs is the study
.of madness.' Choose the best kind of life,
' and custom will focn render it permanently
J agreeable.
Seneca. Inebriety is neither more nqr
less than a voluntary insanity.
Socrates. Nature's real wants are few,
but the cravings of fancy are infinite.
Temple, Sir William. O temperance !
thou virtue without pride and fortune, with
out envy, thou best guardian of youth and
fnpport of ol(J age, tjie precept of retsfon as
well as of religion, and'phyfician of the foul
as well as the body.
Zeno. A wife man will drink wine, but
will not fuffer himfelf to be intoxicated by
it. This Celebrated philosopher was high
ly pleased with the morality of the cynics,
butdifgnftedwiththeir immodesty and impu
dence. He therefore instituted a new fe&,
which from his teaching in a porch or por
tico were styled Stipes ; hi# reputation soon
spread all*t>ver Greece, and he became, in
a short time, the mod distinguished philoso
pher in that country. Zeno lived to the
age of ninety-eight, without ever being at
tacked by any diseases. He taught philo
foghy forty-eight years, and died in the hun
dred and twenty-ninth Olympiad, and was
regretted by all who were friends to virtue
and learning. The Atheniaus caused a
tomb to be ereÂ£ted sacred to his memory, in
the ftiburb of Cararifica, and by a public de
cree gave him a crown of gold, and caused
extraordinary honours to be paid to his mem
ory, as the decree expresses it, he
perfeftly excited the youth under his care
.to virtue, and always led a life conforma
ble to the precepts he inculcated and taught.

CALCUTTA, November 16, 1796.
The French frigates were repairing at
Mergui, they had sustained in
the late action. Their loss is reported to
have been *v?ry considerable, both in the
number of their killed and wounded, as well
as in the injury done to their hulls and rig
ging. Two of the frigates were completely
dismasted. Admiral Sercey intended to
have gone to Batavia ; but the dibbled
state of his squadron rendered it indispensably
neceflary to bear .up for a nearer port, in or
der to effect some urgent repairs.
The detachment of Native Infantry order
ed to be formed at Midnapore, are to remain
at that station, till the progreflion of political
affairs to the southward, shall determine the
impending question of peace or war.
Without pretending to better means of
judging than our neighbours, we are decid
ly of opinion that there will be 110 war.
The best reason for thinking Tippoo paci
fically inclined at present, is, that it is his
best interest to continue in peace. Yet, if
contrary to all reasonable expectation, war
should become unavoidable, it is highly fa
tisfadlory to know and to reflett that the
English goverument is fully competent and
prepared

Par cere fubje&is, et deb el I are fafter bos. t
We cannot too much admire the genius
of that philosophy, which teaches us to
feel with luch perfeft composure, or rather
10 feel not at all, for the distresses of others-
In a bosom, for instance, whose pafiions are
not dignified by the absolute controul of rea
son, the slaughter of twenty thousand human
beings, might awaken a spark of companion
or invite a fyrapathetic tear, for the fuffer
ings of widows, or helpless orphans, or of
families bereft of all their support. But
how vain and ridiculous would such sensibili
ty appear in thÂ« eye of that superior wisdom
which, in the happiest style of pleasantry,
difcovcrs even in the death of twenty thou
sand men, in the fufferings of their friends,
nothing more than a source of jest, from
which we may be ingeniously provided with
les veritables bonnet touches, of the Ortolan
kind.
Oath in Evidence. The witnefljk-iwears,
fays Dr. Paley, ' to speak the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
touching the matter 111 question.'âUpon
which it may be observed, that the designed
concealment of any truth, which relates to
the .matter, in agitation, is as much a viola
tion of the oath, as to teftify'a positive falfe
hood ; and this, whether the witness be in
terrogated to that particular point or not ;
for when the person to be examined is sworn
upon a voire-dirc, that is, in order to en
quire, whether he ought to be admitted to
give evidence in the caufc at all, the form
runs thus :
1 You shall true answer make to all such
questions as (hall be aflied you ;' but, when
he comes to be sworn in chief, he swearsâ
' to speak the whole truth,' without re
straining it as before, to the questions that
shall be asked ; which difference shews that
the law intends, in this latter cafe, to re
quire of the witness that he give a complete
and unreserved account of what he knows,
of the fubjeft of the trial, whether the ques
tions prapofed to him reach the extent of
his knowledge or not. So that if it be en
quired of the \vitnefs afterwards, why he did
not infovm the court so and so, it is not a
fufScient, though a very common answer,
to fayâ' Because it was never asked me.'
In refutation of the complaint of a paper
of last week, that the Delhi* newspapers
were not prpcurable here but via Bombay,
we have been mofl obligingly favored with
several of the latefl of the Delhi newspapers,
received immediately from that capital. We
regret extremely that we have been unable
to prepare tranfltions a in time for this day's

We are sorry to find it confirmed that the
recent death of the Nabob of Furtuckabad
was iji confequer.ce of polfon adminiflered

it is always painful to relate. Three of the

SIR,
The question Ivben will the eighteenth cen
tury end ? was firfl proposed here
month ago, since which time the
of it has set many of his majesty's loyal fub
jeÂ£ts by the ears.
What a pity it was not darted to the
good people of England two or three years
ago, ; it might amuse them fully as well as
politics, and though probably With equal
danger to themselves, yet certainly with lefs
danger to the state.
But 4s we are very harmless politicians in
Bengal, and as this question is agitated with
a degree of warmth bordering on violence,
by men even of the best education and the
firft rate abilities ; and as hiftoriaps and
chranologifts may be ranged 011 each fide as
authorities without elucidating the fuhject ;
I trust that some indulgence will be grant
ed me, if by close reafqning, clear deduct
ions, and flriÂ£t analogy, I endeavor to an
ftver the question, reconcile the contending
parties, and afTert my own right to be a
component part of the century, to which I
only have the power of giving the name.
I take it for granted that every person
will allow the moment immediately after
the nativity to have been the JirJl of the
christian sera, that this firft moment and fif
ty-nine more were the JirJl Uninute, that this
firft minute and fifty-nine more were thp
firjl hour, that this firft hour and' twenty
three more were theJirJl day, that this firft
day and 364 more were the JirJl year, and
that from the begging to the end of it eve
ry day might be faid to.be in the
JirJl yearâand that it could only be denom
inated one ycaf-when every moment of it was
completely past.
Here then it evidently appears that JirJl
takes precedence of oneâlt was the JirJl
year when palling, only when past.
The next year was the second when- pasT
ing ; and when past and added to the JirJl,
they counted two years. The third year
when past and added to the JirJl and second
were counted three years.
The Jixthyear when past and added to the
1 ft, 2d, 3d, 4th and sth, were counted Jix
years ; and by the parity of reasoning the
ninety Jixth year when past, and added to the
ninety five preceding years were counted
ninety Jix years, of course when the hundredth
year was past and added to the preceding
ninety nine years, one complete century had
elapsedâwhich proves by the clearest de
monstration that this century ends with the
last moment of the eighteen hundredth year.
To every man open to conviftion the a
bove flatement will be fatisfadtory andcon
cluGveâlt shews the absolute neceflity of
employing ordinal numbers to denote the
faffing or current portions of time in every
xra that was since the beginning of the
world, or tint will be reckoned until the end
of time.
It flu we that the only use of cardinal
numbers 'when employed, for they are not
necefTary simply to dtnote the units or
complete ) ears that are past, but cannot ap
ply to preitnt' current timeânor has the
number emj loyed a greater reference to the
last year of the series than it had to the firft.
Still however the advocates for ninety-nine
alTerl that cardinal numbers only were used
in the computation of the christian; sera, be
cause it was not computed regularly from
the nativity, and only firft thought ps by
Dionyfius, five hundred and sixteen years
afterwards.
But he could have veiy little trouble in
reckoning the years past, he had only to
count a hundred to every century, as we
would count Gold mohurs, and the year in
which he was doing so would molt certainly
be an ordinal year, and denoted Jive hundred
and seventeenth year, and the sera would go
on regularly afterwards to the end of the
world, had it not been interrupted by the
present reforming fcepticks in chronology.
The whole force of their argument goes
to prove that we cannot fay the year ninety
Jix till ninety jix be past (for they mak? it an
adje&ive in the fingnlar number) and there
fore that we continue to fay ninety Jix till
nintty-feven be paftâfothat we must denote
every occurrence which takes plaee in this
current year as happening in last year, tho'
past nearly ten months ago. An exTinple
or two twill illuftratc this new mode of com
putation ; for instance the Arrogant and
Viftorious had an aftion with the French
frigates on the eight day of September, beiijg
the nine month of this ninetyjix year. And
yet the aftion must have happened on the day
before as day eight was past before it could
be counted, and in the month before as
month nine, was also past before it was count
ed, in the fame manner that ninety-fix was
past before it was so denominated. Again,
I have written this defence of myfelf on this
nineteen day of O(Sober, which was past last
night, at twelve o'clock.
This may be conlidered ps turning the
fubjeft into ridicule, yet I d<?fy any man ot
use cardinal numbers io denote current time
in any other manner ; but if any one think
he can, let him answer in cardinal numbers
the following questions :
In what year did our Gracious Sovereign
come to the throne ? In what year did Lord
Howe defeat the Freirch fleet ? On what
day of <his month will term begin ? and by
what names will the lawyers call it and the
day after it ? Some would call the firft Zero
day, and the next day, One, and find out
by adding them that 0 and J would make
TnÂ»o,
Some however admit that tin's may be
the Ninctj-fcvmth Tear, forgetting that the
moment an ordinal number clcpreffed or tin- *
"derftood is at all admitted, their whole fa
bric tumbles to the ground. For the dif- i
â¢PUte entirely hinges on the fmgle qutfticn.
Whether the ordinal number iooth â  Was
made or not in the firft century to
'denote the twelve months intervening bet
ween the inftartt which completed ninety
nine years, and the instant which completed
one hundred years ?âFor the number of i
years, days and hours computed by each par
ty are exaaiy the fame. If Cardinal num
bers alone were fufficient, no doubt their
mode of computing a century wouldbeftriS
ly cQireft ; for the twelve months mention
! tioned mil ft have been must have been called
Ninety-nine, until rffte hundred years vvefe
I completed. But we shall immediately fee
! that no cardinal number excepting the firlV,
, can Apply to a single year, that all the Vcft
being adjectives without a lingular number
can only denote a plurality of years which
in calculating an JEn are ccmpleated and
past, or supposed to be' so. We cannot
! join'an adjective in the plural number to a
fubilantive in the lingular, without grofV
violation of gramaticaal concord. And it i*
just as absurd to fay the year Ninety fix, as
to fay the Man Ninety-fix, or the Ninety-fix,
Calf, or Coofe. I instance these as substan
tives in which the finguW is different from
the plural in found, that the absurdity may
appear in a more conspicuous point of view.
Here then the neceflity of using ordinal
numbers to denote present or current porti
ons of time is evident. They afe adjectives
that have no plural number, and can denote
a lingle purtioit of time as present, whether
it be a century, year, or day, .&c. and
every number not only denotes the current
j year, but also all the past years of the cen
tury, Eighteenth Century denotes the cur
rent one, and that seventeen had preceded
itâninety-ftxth year denotes the present year
and that ninety five more are past, Tenth
Month denotes the present, and that nine
more of ithis year are past, and the nineteenth,
the prefect day, and that eighteen More are
alre-c'y past of this month.
In this way we can date the tranfafliuns
of everyyear without ambiguity or absurdity
j even to the very moment of a
occurrence happened. The action just
now alluded to will again serve as an ex
ample. It took place on the eighth day of
the ninth month, of the ninety-fxth year of
the eighteenth century.
I may be told that JthappenedOneThou
fand Seven Hundred and Ninety-fix Yeais,
Eight Months, Seven Days, Eight hows
and a half, after the Birth of Christ, but as
it lasted near three hours, was it in the One
hour, or the two hour, or the three hour,
that Captain Clark was wounded j or fec<*/d,
or third hour of the afiion ?
Having now clearly proved the necaflity
of denoting current years, &c. by ordfnil
numbers, and (hewn the propriety of apply
ing them exclusively to the composition of
the Chrifu'an and every other -/Era, and de
monstrated that where cardinal numbers are
at all used, they must succeed the ordinal as
regularly as night fuccecds day, viz, one
fueceeds frjlâten the tenthâfifty s thefftieth,
and one hundred the huudreth.âLet us now
try how far we are fupportsd by analogyâ
His Majesty calls this the 3stb year of his
Reignâthe Americans call it the 21 ft of*
American Independenceâthe
it the sth jmr of their Republic,
all call it the 4th year of the present War.-
And to conclude with the best authority,
Doftor Johnson expressly asserts, that A.
D. 1751, means in the seventeen hundred
and fifty firft year from the birth of our Sa
viour ; and would, I dare fay, if now alive,
knock any man down, with his foh'o di&iofc
ary, who could have the effrontery to dispute
the rank in the Century, so jullly claimed
by the
ONE HUNDRED TH YEAR. ,
P. S. The Card in alia ns driven to theut
moft ver<je of sophistical ratiocination, are
now obliged to deny that time is ever present
or pajfing. If so, there can be no time in
which any thing can be done; thepoflis gone
the Juture may never come; and it is only
aftonifliing in what division of time they were
able to advance such novel dodlrines.

Extract of a letter from a gentleman at
Nantes, to a refpeC'tablfc house in this city, j
dated Jvine 15, 1797.
" The certainty whiclj the executive di
rectory of France has had, tljat many Eng
lish vefiels failed under American colours,
and that many American vefiels failed with
the greater part of their crew's English, has (
provoked the decree of the executive dir.ee- ;
toryofthe 12th Ventofe, sth year, (2d
March, '97) which prtferibes that all A
merican vefiels (hall be captured and con
demned as good prizes, which 1 have not a
Role d'Equipage ; or even having one, if the
caatam, or any officer or supercargo, or one
third of the crew should be English. In
qpnfequerice, every American vessel to Igyp
rule, ought to have a role d'equipage,
tainirig the names of baptism and family, the
place of birth and place of residence of every
individual on board, comprehending both 'â¢
the crew and paflengers ; and if any of them '
should not be born in the United States, he â 
mud have Â» prote&ion from the United i
States, which certifies that he was a natural
ized citizen of the United States before the j
present war. This role d'equipage ought to .
be signed by two witrtefies, who attest the
truth of the fa&s, and fubferibed by the offi
cer or judge of the marine, who has given
to the individuals the permission of embark
ing." _ Â» '
An English gentleman, lately driven from
Philadelphia by the prevailing fever,âby i
chance, took up his residence at Middle-
Town Point, New-Jerseyâwithin one mile
of which place, he is now employed in boring i
for COAL, and has already come to that
species of (tone which always covers the
Newcastle pit coalâHe has had 30 years
experience in coal-mining, and is very fan
guiue as to his success. This mud be a
pleasing piece of news to the citizens of New-
Yorjt ; for, ftiould the coal prove good, it

A letter from Cape Nichola Mole, of
August 28, fays, " I am exceeding sorry
to communicate to you, that your schooner
Regulator is now under trial of the court
of vice admiralty, which is now held at
Mole St. Nicholas. I failed from L'An
ceveaux the 27th of July, and on the 28th
following was boarded by his Britannic ma
jelly's ship Ratler, who treated me exceed
ingly well, examined all my papers and
found them right. The captain wifiied me
a good voyage, and told me to proceed,
which I accordingly did, anjl on the 29th
â¢ following was boarded by the government
ship Lewis Farquharfon, mailer,
who ordered me to Port au Prince, and took
roe out of the schooner on board his ship,
and took all my papers in his charge. On
the 4th of August we arrived at Port au
Prince, where 1 made myfelf known to
your friends, Mr. Forbes and Mr. Cognac.
I have entered a regular protest and left a
copy with Mr. Forbes, to be sent in your
schooner Fox, v iich I expeÂ£t will fail with
convoy from thence. When I was
taken, captain Farquharfon told me, that
he had received strong information from
captain Clement Miner, maflir of the sloop
Nancy, of New-York, that my cargo was
French property, and for that very reason
he took me and intended to libel me."

and Portsmouth, shall appear on Monday.
BOSTON, September 27.
REVIEW OF MILITIA.
Yesterday his excellency the commander
in chief, reviewed at Concord the whole of
the third division of militia of this com
monwealth, commanded by major general
Hull.
Prectfely at ten o'clock the Several corps
took the stations assigned them, and the re
view Commenced at twelve. â
The fitimtion of the ground made it ne
cefiary to form two lines, like semi-hollow
squares.
The firft, commanded by brigadier-ge
neral Walker, confitted of one squadron of
cavalry, under major Brown, composed of
csvptains Jones's, Fowle's, Coolidge's and
Wyman's corps ; âtwo companies of light
infantry, commanded by captains Bigelow
and Butterick ; âone battalion of artillery
undef - capt. Hastings, composed of his and
capt. Bemus's companies; and four regi
ments of infantiy, commanded by colonels
Coolidge, Flint, Colburne and Perry.
The second line, commanded by briga
dier-general Woods, contained three troops ;
of cavalry, commanded by captains Flet
cher, Blood and Flood ; âone battalion of
artillery, commanded by captains Farnf
worth, Gardner and French ; and three
regiments of infantry, commanded by co
lonels Swain, Ofgood and Varnum.
The whole, making seven corps of ca
valry, two companies of light infantry,
five companies of artillery, and seven regi
ments of infantry, were in complete and .
elegant cloth uniforms, were fully officered, j j
and completely armed and equipped. Eve- 1 ,
ry corps had a full proportion of music,
the cavalry were elegantly mounted, and
the daft' could not be lurpafied by the best
Europe can produce.
The troops had no sooner formed than a
fevers equinoxial derm commenced; and
before his excellency appeared on tl# parade j
the whole of them were drenched to the
fltin. The troops nevertheless went through
the usual manoeuvres and evolutions with
veteran exaftnefs. .
Before twelve the comitiander in chief, ,
ifcorted by capt. Fowle's troop of cavalry,
arrived at Concord,. where capt. Jones took <
up the efcor!, and his. â¬KccJleÂ«cy, accom
panied by major-general Elliot, the adju
tant and quarter-miller generals, and seve
rn! other dad-officers, processed to the re
vrew, notwithdariding the inclemency of
the weather. The storm prevented
military exhibitions ; prudence, if not ne
cessity, requiring the immediate difmiflal of
the troops after the review.
Until the rain commenced, the scene was
splendid and beautiful ; and the elemental
inconvenience which general Hull and his
whole division experienced, gave Â»pain t<v
the bread of sensibility. We could enume
rate many excellencies of conduft, which
| were highly honourable to our countrymen,
even under the iuaufpicious date of the
weather, 3id the admit. But this
sketch is put to the press at a late hour.
The RtmtrkabU Fiji, mentioned in the Mercury
of yesterday, is cert.iin'.y a novelty on this coast.
It appears, fayÂ» a eorrefpondent, to be the famn fifli
described by Brooks, ip his Natural Hillory,
the name of the Sea Fox, It is so called, he fays,
on account of the length of his tail, an<l from the
ftrongfmell of the flefli Buffon terms it the long
tailed Shark, and observeÂ«, that it was anciently
1 a'lled Sea Horse, from its supposed cunning. It is
usually met with in the Mediterranean Sea. Brooks
ohferves, that it is sometimes so large, as to weigh
above 100 pounds, and Peasant mentions oÃe as
remarkable, which, measured 13 feet in length.â
A particular description of the ont now exhibited
would be desirable ; a cursory examination, has
induced a belief, that it would he found to bÂ» lar
ger than thojf defended by European naturalists.
Riches of Ejftx âOn Monday, arrived at Dan
vers, from the Grand Bank, schooner Sajly. 86
tons burthen, belonging to capt. Samuel Page, Gi
deon Rea, mailer, with upwards of one tboufand
quintals of fifh, and 24 bbls of oil. In the year
1791,, the fame schooner landed 1176 quiutals al
one fare, and in I'pi, (he landed 1046 quintals at
ore fare from the Bay of St l.awrenco. These
are the thiee largsfl fares we haveevnr heard ofbe

.'ln order to lessen your prejudices against
Weeding, mercurial purges and faliyation,
I do hereby certify, that I api just recover
ed from a relapse of the yellow fever, occa
froned by relying too much on my own
Iftrength, and undertaking a long journey,
before I was able to perform it, without
consulting my physician and friends, which
I mention as a caution to others. My firft
attack was very severe, for the cure of which
I loft 126 ounces of blood in 12 bleedings,
and the last time I loft 24 ounces in 3 bleed
ings, making in all 150 ounces, besides
I had several blisters, &c. applied
both times, and took freely of mercury,
internally and externally, by order of my
physician, Samuel Cooper, to whtofe (kill
and care, under God, I owe great obliga
tions for the preservation of my life.
DAVID EVANS, juh.
Mr. John Fenno.
[Mr. Evans being a very ingenious and ufeful
citizen his friends and the public, will hear v->h
great (atisfaSion, of hu recovery.
As ttrere appears to be a mifconftruSion of the
sentiments advancÂ«dÂ«n the Gazette of the United
States, it may be proper to state, that neither mer
curial purges, nor lalivation nor bleeding (in mo
deration) have ever been opposed in this paper ]
A correfpnndÂ«nt observes, on the fubjeft
of the approaching Election, that every ci
tizen ought to realize the importance, of his
vote, at the felettion of persons to manage
the public concerns - and every mau who
wilfully neglcfte giving in his vote, ought to
be considered as committing a crime against
liberty. To what purpose is it that we have
a mild, free and equitable government, if we
f'iffer a eabal to get possession of the feat
<;f eleftion, and overrun the house with Ja
cobins, Democrats, Frenchmen and pre
tended Republicans. Advert, citizens of
Philadelphia, to that awful warning which
now hangs over your heads, and guard a -
gainst a future neceflily for similar calamities
by (hutting the door against French princi
ples and every thing Frejich. He who can,
at the present ajvful moment, set on foot a
eabal, for the extension of French influence,
is upon a level with those miscreants who,
at Port Royal, while the earth was shaking
under their feet, went about robbing and
collefting plunder.
To the PUBLIC.
THJJ sum appropriated by the Legislature
for the relief and unfortcuate citizens of Philad-
Iphia, during the p* vailing sickness, being
nearly, if not wholly expended, and as no further
aid can, at prefer.t, be derived from the fame
ource, the fuffering poor are under the neceflity
of relying on the individual benefu3ions cf their
more wealthy fellow-citizens, to whose fympa
thv and hnmir.ity they look up with confidence,
from the generosity heretofore inanifefted on
similar occasions:âAnd as the citizens of our
fifterftates may ibe disposed to unite their good
offices in aidivg the dJlâ ejj'td, it may be proper
to mention the commissioners appointed by the
governor (of whom Robert Wharton, esq. is

county in this Jlate, not regarding their duty as
citizens, nor the peace, order and good govern
ment of this and the United Slates ; of their
own mischievous minds and imagination, and
in contempt nf the laiu authorities of the said
fates did lately, in the 'county of Merklenburg
aforcfctid, and parts, adlacent, Jet on foot and
prepare for carrying on, a military expedition,
for the invasion of and taking into their pojpf
fionjhe territory of the Indians, on the
Tennessee, with whom the United States are
at peace. Aid for the above nefarious purposes,
by themselveS and others, did ferfuade, incite
and stir up many persons in tlx said county cf
Mecil nlurg and elf ewhere, to cnlijl and eqt so
| themselves as fo/diers ; and did actually caufÂ»
such enl'Jlmcnts and equipment to be made.
Wherefore to prevent such daring and illegal
proceedings in future, ami to bring the said
EizekielPoil, John JohnJl on and others, prin
cipal offenders, to jujlice, I do, by and with ad

CAUTION.
WHF.REAS a combination of men in this
county have undertaken to enrich thtm
felves,hT fabricating titles to fundr/ valuable traSs
of land, She propeiÂ»yof gentlemen living-in New
York, Philadelphia, London and Paris, for which
trails of knd large sums of money have been paid
to those fraudulent men, by innocent purthafers
It is therefore just that public information Ihould
be given, to the end, thatth. injurjd may fetk re
dress while the reen have property, and aue to be
found. Those who have been discovered are Trft
man Ha-rifon, Joseph Witeomb, fatd now to rc
fide in the county of Saratsga ; Thomas Kelly ar.d
several otheri who go under fictitious names. It is
supposed that the lands offered fcr sale on those fa
bricated titles, are at ltaft worth fifty thousand
dollars. Such as we haveafiual knowledge of are
as follows : Lots No. II and 12, Otfego patont,
thcufand acres each, the adsai property of William
Dellwyn, now of London ; lots No. 58 and 64,
fame patent, thousand acres each, the property of
' Mr. Chaumont, now of Paris, and lames Averill
â¢ and others, o! tWs State. There is some grounds
' to suppose that the lands of Richard Wells and
â¢ Charles Wharton, of Philadelphia, ire under their
5 management. âThe'Vrinters will do well to give
â  this a place in their papers, as well to caution the
1 public against purchaling those tandf, as also to de
â¢ prive those men in future from rmpofujg on indivi
- duifs, which their education and address have en
s abled them to do heretofore. Witeomb has been
" a (hepkeeper of some note in this eountry.
- The following affidavits will let in a clear point
of viewtht wickiidnefs of those men,which vvhtn
- the public have perulcd, will induce them to ex
e cuTe the intciference of Wm. COOPER.

i was the property of William T. Franklin now Mr.
- Chamont's and others ; ind further tl>e laid Joseph
- and Truman did pcrfuade me to do this against my
inclination, which was made cut on the icth day
d of November, 1793, or set back tWo years so aÂ»

T7VER. since this disease m&de such ravagesin thij
-ili city and New-York, the author lias turned hit
attention to its caufea and cure.âThe result of his
em}turn??, has convinced him that the reason why so*
few persons recover from its attacks, are fr<-mi its
not being well understood, and the consequent
wrontj method taken to cure it. He is persuaded
that the exceflive bleedigps and rpercuri#! reatment
of the Faculty is highly injurious, and that the on
ly rational mode of treatment is by the life of proper
acids. Convinced of this he offers his Specific as a
certain remedy, if ufei according to the dire&ions.
