PROPOSAL,
For Publi/bing by Subscription,
AN
E N I R Y
INTO THE
OSTGV* OF EPIDEMIC DISEASES.
r J" I HIJ Letters to Dr. Currie, which I publilhed
X l ift autumn, led me to an investigation of
tb* origin anil phenomena of peftilantial diseases
in other countries, as well as in the United St tes.
In the profrcutioii of the fubje<st, new fadb and
principles continually opened to my and fi
nally determined me to trace back the history of
fiuh diseases as far as the records Â»f history ex
tend. For this purpose, I have examined the pub
lic libraries in New-York, New-Haven, Cam
bridge and Boston, with a view to obtain all the
material fails which can illustrate the fubjÂ»<st,and
I have nearly collected all the materials for the
propofcd work.
The la its eell.&ed wi'l enable mc to demon
strate that many of the common idea* refpe<Sing
pestilential epidemics, are untounded or extreme
ly in correal ; and this in consequence of medical
writers canfidering an epidemic disease as a detach
ed or isolated phenomenon in a particular coun
try ; rather than as connefted with other epide
mics or other phenomena of nature in various
parts of the world. The faSs 1 have collc&ed
lead to certain deductions which are furprifingto
â¢myfelf, and which will probably be new to many
others. Much light will be thrown on this dark
and perplexing fubjeit, as well as on natural phi
losophy.
The proposed work will make a full fixed oita
vo volume ; and executed well on fine paper, caH
not be afforded at lets than two dollars, bound,
with the ufunl allowance to book-fellers. At the
compilation will 00ft not only great labor, but con
siderable expence, no more copies will be printed
than to supply fubferibers. The hook will be rea
dy for fubferiber searly ill the coming funimer, and
the holders of proposals will be good enough to
retnrn them to No. 40, Pine-flreet, by the firft of
May.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES'
SICK AND DISABLED SEAMEN.
Tuesday, April 10.
( Concluded from yeflerday's Gaxeth.)
Mr. Sew all did 1101 think the gentleman
from New-York had treated him, or his crb
fervations, with much canddur. That gen
tleman,'faid he, claim! to himfelf a great de
gree of benevolence and charity towards the
sailors of the United States. He is the father
of this bill,which conliders these men as inca
pable of taking care of themselves, and calls
upon them to fubferibe for their own support
in cafe of sickness or inability, without taking
a farthing from the pocket of the United
States, or from the gentleman himfelf. The
gentleman spoke of charity ; he tlvoug'U -his
charity equal to that gentleman's. [Mr. Li
ving ston said he was far from fpeak/'ng of
his own charity]. Mr. S. said, he was him-,
felf arguing apauift his own interest; for it had
been (aid by the gentleman from New-York,
that in cafe rhis bill parted into a law, persons
who hacl beeri heretofore called upon to sup
port this,clafs of men, would in future b? Â«x
---cufedfi"om this charge ; whereas, if it did nqt
pass, he Ihoiild bo charged with this tax as at
present. But he contended, that as die sai
lors of Malfachufetts could hot be excused
from paying the town taxes, it was h;yd they
Ihould be tailed upon again to pay for the
support of their own body. Yes for doing
this, he was charged witii pertinacity and a
want of benevolence towards this clals of men-
Mr. S. believed he had a greater re fpert for
teamen than that ge'itlentan, and it was his
opinion, that the f-iilors were able to take cure
of themselves, without the alliltance of the
gentleman from N-fw-York.
Befi jts, said Mr. S. this bill proposes the
erettion of public hospitals (however econo
mically thev mav be built) not merely for the
fe imen of the United States, hut for the fea
tren of foreign nations so that the sailors of
this country âa class of men who have nothing
to spareâare also c alled upon and forced to
support a public charity for foreigners ; for
out of iooÂ»cirizens of the United States who
pas to this fund, perhaps not one would re
ceive any benefit from it. If there had been
previous benefaCtionstoaconliderable amount
for this objett, as had been the cafe in other
countries, an! these contributions were want
ed only for currer.texpences, the thing would
have been different.
But the gentleman from New-York repre
feyts the people of Malfachufetts as receiving
great advantages from a bounty on filh ex
ported, which was intended to reimburse the
dirty on fait used in their business of curing
filh ; and he had calculated this advantage
far beyond w hat it really Vs. But admitting
that they receive fometlung more than the a
mount ofthe duty paid on their fait, it mult
be allowed that it went to the encouragement
of a let ot men at all times valuable to the
United States, but particularly so at this time.
But.;was this any argument why he Ihould not
oppose this fax ? Would it be proper
for him to aufwer to these men, when
they complained of this tax, " You are taxed,
it is true, for the support of foreigners, to up
hold a piitil-c charity for the Un.ted States,
who will have the honotrr of taking care of
seamen ; but you ought to be fatisfied, be
cause the general government allows you a
bounty onthe exportation of your filh." He
believed not. And ha believed the gen/le
niaft from New-York had as little realcare for
seamen as he had for the filheries of the Uni
ted States.
Mr. S. said, he would next notice some
obrtrvations of the gentleman from 5. Caro
lina (Mr. Pinckney) which partook offonic
thing like argument. That gentleman laid,
the sailors ought to pay the tax, Secaufe
were to receive the benefit arising from it.
But he had before stated the seamen of New r
England do not want this provision, and why
tax them for what they do not want? The
sailors there would be averse to being remov
ed from their homes and friends, to an hos
pital at adiftance. It was said this eftablilh
meut-would aiiord similar.relies to that provi :
vicTed for our failnrs in Foreign Countries.
He thought it very different, as that was pro
vided at the public expence, and this was to
be raised from the la'l Or# themselves. He
believed the sailors of New England .would
sooner take their chance abroad, than pay this
tax for Befides, the fifhermen
never go info the southern states ; they are
employed exclulively in fiftiing, and export
ing their filli.
3efides this tax would have an eSeÂ£t to drive
our seamen out ol the country. The tax
would fail upon the merchant, and be deduc-.
ted from their wages. It would also fall hea
viest uponthofc seamen who have families and
are fixed in the country. A foreigner could
afford a fmxll deduttion from his wages ; but
a native feainan with a family could not af
ford it.
As it the federalifm of the thing,
he was in favour of every measure which went
to eftablilh harmony betwixt different parts
of the country ; but he had no idea of taxing
a single order of men on this account.
Mr. S. Smith believed, with the gentle
man last up, that this would be a tax upon
the merchants, as the sailors mnft have fufii
cient to support them. He did not believe the
filhermen could complain ; for though the
geutleman dated that the bounty allowed up
on the exportation of fi!h was only meant as a
drawback ofthe duty paid upon the fait used
in fa!ting the fifh for exportation, every man
inuft be convinced that it far exceeds that a
mount, as he believed the sum allowed was
greater than the whole sum paid by that date
foiMhe fait duly. i.The Speaker asked whe
ther these obfcrvur.ons applied to the questi
on f] If they did not Mr. S. wished gentle
men who had preceded him on the fame sub
ject had been interrupted. The Southern
States, Mr. S. continued, were as able to
keep their seamen from perilhing as the Eas
tern ; but this was a measure which would re-,
dound to the honour of the United States.
No fjilor, he was certain, would grudge'to
pay 10 cents out of jo dollars tor so excellent
a purpose. The tax would eventually fall
upon the merchant or landlord ; but he be
lieved upon the landlord, as they generally
got the surplus of the sailors money.
Mr. J. Parker was sorry the gentleman
from MafTacfiufetts could not consider all the
fÂ«amen of the United States as Handing upon
the fame ground. That gentleman was mis
taken when lie said the bill went to provide
for the support of foreigner? ; it had no such
view, it provided only for thw relief of our
own citizens. And in our present Ctuation,
when the country is threatened wilh war,
what encouragement was there for men to en
ter 011 board our vessels, if there were no afy- '
luni forthem in cafethey were sick or wound- '
cd? It would be wife and politic, in his o
pinion, to begin mealures which mud place
these persons in a better situation tlun at pre
sent. The British sailor looked up to Green
wicll Hofpiul as an afyluin when all iiis toils
ate Â«vef ; arid-pÂ«rhapj it may be owing, in
fame tneafure, to this cÂ»rcuiii(tance, that the
t!tit Ih fa'lors arefo valiant a lit orf-men. "He
hoped, therefore, the tailors of this country
would lotbe left to the doubtful benevolence
of others ; but that by palling tins bill, a
permanent relief might be afforded fhein in
caL- Ol* sickness, diability or old age.
Mr. VARNUMfaid, it had been observed,
that this bilrwould relieve the citizens of
Mairatluifetts from taxes in support of this
class of men. It might in some refpedt do
this; bat it would not excuse sailors them-
I elves from paying to the support of others,
equally with their fellow citizens. He did
not know but the United States have the
power to make the proposed regulation; but
he thought it was a bufiueff which more par
ticularly concerned the Legidature of the In
dividual States. If the United States, in
deed, thought this class rf men Of so much
mere importance than any other, the people
at large, he thought ought to be called upon
to support them in djftrefs ; and ifhofpitlls
are to be supported for this putpofe, the pub
lic ought to support them, and not the sailors
themselves.
Mr, V. did not know how the gentleman
who used it, understood the term Federalism ;
but if meant that Federalism which was
supported by the Constitution, lie did not
know how he would reconcile it with that
clause of it which fays " that no capitation,
or other direct tax, fliall be laid, unlefsiu
proportion to the census or enumeration di
retted to be taken."
Mr. V. did not think that this kind of tax
was confident with Federal principles ; for it
might as well be (aid, because the State of
MalTiichufetts is potFelfed of some particular
advantages over other Sta'es, every citizen of
chat State lhall pay a poll-tax often dollars
a year for the benefit of the Union, as that
the sailors of that Sme Ihould be called up
on bo support an establishment in which they
will be but little intereded.
Mr. Gallatin said, this was 4 cafe of
very new impreflion to him, which, perhaps,
might be one of the reafsns why he felt dis
posed to vote agaitift this bill. Until he law
some positive good as likely to ariftf from any
measure, he was always inclined rather to
vote again dit than for ir. This bill afTumed
a principle for its foundation, the truth of
which he vva; not acquainted with, viz. That
the seamen of the United States arc not able
to provide for themselves, and therefore
that it is necellary to provide a ftim for their
relief ift cafe of sickness or disability. He
had not seen this distinction between them
and other dalles of citizens, and therefore
believed them to he capable of taking care 0/
themselves. He knew there were in ail com
munities a number of men Who were not fuf
fic:ently provident to lay by money to afford
relief in sickness, or to make old comfort
able ; but he did not know that there was a
greater numberof this description of persons
amongst seamen than amongst others.
Institutions of the kind recommended in
this bill might be ufeful in other countries,
wherethere was a dilfinttion betwixt sailors
and other citizens ; bat in the United States,
he had not been able' to discover any material
diftindtion betwixt them and other clalTes of
men. How far Marine Hospitals had been
ufeful in Europe, he could not tell ; he knew
there were many rotten public institutions of
Hospitals, &c. there, which were eftabtilhed
for good purposes at firft, but which are now
become worse than uffctefs. But fuppoftng the
mftitution to be.a good One he thought it bet
ter to leave the bullnefs as at present, and
fuffer this class of people to provide for
themselves, or to be provide*for ill the lime
way in which' other poor and lick, or disabled
pcrfonsare supported.
Tiiere was one pWrt of the bill, which he
said he could not content to vote for, viz.
â¢hat part u brich directs the erettion of build
ings ; as he was convinced that persons of
every deftribtion mÂ«y be better relieved by
being dilperf'ed through the country, than in
being placed in an hol pital. He was opposed
also' to the maimer in which the fund is pro
posed to beraifed. If he was inclined to pro
vide relief for sailors, as a didinft class ot ci
tizens, he wasagaiiilt providing a fundfor the
purpose by a tax upon labour, which would,
in all reflects, be a capitation tax. Gentle
men might argue as they pleated about the
tak falling upon merchants ; it was impolfible
to fay upon whom a tax upon labour would
fall. InJ'ome infta'nees, it would fall upon
the sailors themselves ; in othefs it would fall
upon the merchants ; and in some of thsfe it
would be paid by the merchants themselves,
and in others by the community.
Mr. G. did not under,land that there was
any diftintt provifron for seamen in the Eastern'
States ; they were provided for in common
with other citizens ; and, as it was allowed
they furnilhed two thirds of the seamen of the
United States, and as the representatives from
that quarter knew what kind of relief the sai
lors liked bed, he thought it right to c#tifult
their wishes upon the fubjeÂ£t. It they are fa
tisfied to support their seamen in the way they,
do, he did not know why a tax of this kind
Ihould beraifed for their relief.
Mr. G. said, he diould have been glad to,
have lomething as to tire effect this
law would'produce in this city. It was well
known the member from if, who would have
been poflelfed of every information onthefub
ject, has been a long time lick and unable to
attend his duty, in this haute. Seeing the
representatives from New-York, Baltimore
and Charleston in favour of it, and the Eastern
States against it, and not knowing the wishes
of the people of Philadelphia with refpeft to
the measure, he Ihould wilh tor time to obtain
some information upon the subject ; he there
fore moved to pollpone the question on the
pallage of this bill for two days, in order that
he and his colleagues might make fume en
ittqries on the bulinefs.
Mr. Hartley seconded the motion.
Mr. Livingston had no cb'jcflion to the
pohjioncment, especially as the gentleman
from Pennsylvania had expreilid his intenti
on of voting against the bill if palled at pre
sent, and because he knew the efffiSl of en
quiry would be favourable to the bill, r.s he
believed this city was much in the fame situ
ation with the city of New-York.
The question for a poftponemcnt was put
and carried.
-NEW MILITIA SYSTEM.
The house next went into a committee of the
whole on the bill for organizing, difciplin
ingand arming the Militia of the United
Statei ; when Mr. Varnum's motion for
for drikingout the firft seCtion of the bill,
which provides for a feleft and a refcrved
corps ; the former to consist of all young
men from 18 to 10, the latter of all from 24.
to 40.
THE motion for striking out the feflion
was made to try the principle as ttfa feleit
corps, and was supported by MeflVi. V*r
nuk, W. C. Claiborne, Nicholas,
Gallatin, Findley, and Skinner; It
was urged bv them, 'th it to introduce the
proposed system would be wholly to derange
the present eltablilhment, jvhivh, though it
j was noÂ» was capable of being impruv
!ed and mije to nqfwer every .purÂ».>re ( of aÂ»
- tfKvSwtmtlith. i n'pr.)of o! ''this, it waj dat
ed fhat jth.e Mil tia in tlie Eaitern States wai
'in perfect orderayd difciplin?, and that hji;ig
the cafe in thole-Starvs, it -might alfobe rfK
fame in others- if like means >vere taken. Is
the ft me laws were paired by the United Sta'et"
for the tin of the whole Militia as at
, present exiltctl in the ijaftern States, and if
the Militia Officers were every >Vhere'equally
attentive to their duty, the Militia i.light gÂ«-
I ncrally be in equally good order. That the
plan propofad was only known in theory ;
! that though it might answer well in a thickly
fettled country, it would be attended with
many and great inconveniences in iparfe fet
tlemettts, as to get 100 young men together
to exercise would take in a circuit of 20 miles ;
besides that the fending out a large number of
young men together, without perfoiu of more
advanced yettrs as a check upon them, woirfd
hayea bad eifect upon the: r-mora Is, tud to
take young men away from their b.lli.iefs
which they might be jsj.it commencing forten
or twelve days at a time Svould ruin Uiem. â
Nor was it believed that young men could be
so / well or kept together, as if
they were interspersed with persons of grtater
age and solidity.
The new fyitem was supported by Messrs.
J. Williams, S. SMITH, Shepard, Day
ton, Macon, Brookis, Pinkney, and
Harper, as affording at all times an active
efficient Militia of at lead 150,000 men, which
would place the country at all times in lecti
nty, as no foreign power would ever think of
I attacking a country which could call out 1 his
j force j that the young men having been ac
:f tively engaged in discipline from 18 to 24,
| would, after that time to the age of 40, form
1 a reserved corps, ready to be called upon in
cases of emergency. That the difcipliniug
of rhe(e young men would keep the officers in
exercise, and they would learn how to take
. j care of men when they out in service,
j which was a confidcraton of firft importance;
j that young men would train much better to
gether than if fathers and sons" were in the
fame rai its', and being clothed in uniform
they- would become ambitious of excelling in
military duty. That this plan would be more
economical than the present, and would make 1
fewer exceptions from service ; and it was a
iplan which had been warmly recommended
by the firft military man in this country, the
late Prelident of the United States, and would
rendera Standing Army :n the country wholly
unnecedary. â¢
The motion for ftrikingout the fiiit feilion
was loft 45 to 3 1.

i SATURDAY EVENING, April 14.
Yefterriay the H.onfe ot Representatives of
' the United States went again into a comiait
, tee of the wholetyi the (late of the Union, and
resumed the tonlideration ot the resolution
| proposing an appropriation for the purchase of
cannon, arms and ammunition for the service
.of the United States; when the motion pro
posed tp.amend the resolution by giving the
Prelident power, " in cafe of other means
failing in any conlidcrable degree, to purchase
or hre foundries or armouries, which fliall be
employed to manufacture the fame for the life
of die United States," after fonie debate, was
carried, 5a members voting, for it. The reso
lution as amended was agreed to without a di
v-iiion, and a bill directed to be brought in
accordingly. Some other bulinefs was done,
which will be given in co.irfe.
In the coiu'le at"the fitting, Mr. Harper
gave tbc.followijig notice :
Mr.- Speaker,
- BEKORE the House goes into the order of
the dav, I wilh # to give notice of a motion
which, at fomo time before ths end of this
session, I have resolved to fubniit to this
Heule. It is for the reprimand, at thenar of
the House, of one of its members, for the
mots vileand unfounded (landers against.sun
dry itjtjiribers ofthis House. These (landers
are contained in a letter which I have read in
the public prints ofthis city, and which con
tains all that malice and falfhpod could fug
ged for the purpose of defaming the members
of this Hfeule and cf the Government, and of
deltroying their reputation.' I allude, Sir, to
a letter under the (ignature of William Findley,
which has appeared in tile public pripts, and
the writing of which, by that pedon, can, as
I am well ad'ured, be proved by the 1110 ft un
exceptionable teftimooy, Nothing, Sir, but
my unwillingness to interrupt the important
business of the public at this crisis of our af
fairs, prevents me from immediately fubmit-.
ting this motion; and I will add, that Ifheuld
never have troubled the House on the fubjeif
of this person's conduct, did not that age,
which he diibonours, render him an unfit lub
ject for perlonal chaltifement.â
Mr. Findley withed to whether a
member had a right to attack another member
in this manner. If lie saw the latter which
had been alluded to, he could tell whether it
was his or not. Any letter of his, hehelieved,
would speak foritfelf.
Mr. Gallatimwifhed to be informed by
the Speaker, whether it was in order for a
member to rife 111 his placej under pretence of
his giving notice of his intention of making a
tticftidh, and thus abuse another member in the
House, faying he would chaflife him, and so
on. If the gentleman lias a motion to make,
why not make it without this ?
The Speaker replied, that a member had a :
right to give notice of any motion which he j
intended to make ; but, in the opinion of the j
Speaker, the gentleman from S. Carolina had i
gone farther in doing it, than order and deco
rum would jnftify.
Nothing farther paflTed 011 this fubjeft.
For tbi Gazette of the United States.
MR. FENNO,
V\ hile I am detained in this turbulent city
f.om a rJilhnt part of the state by some affairs
of buiinefs.i shall take the liberty of becoming
your correspondent so far as to give you an ac
count of one of the mo!t extraordinary and dif
orderiy scenes that J, or perhaps sny other per
son.ever law exhibited, unleli by the mobs ef
our dear lifter Rtpublic. On my arrival here a
day or two ago, 1 round the walls at almost eve
ry corner of the ftieets decorated with handbills
of an en'irely different and contrary nature. â
One sett (No. t, for I enclose you copies of
three which I happened to get poff ffion of J is
said to have been put forth by a Mr.
(a son of Efculapius) and fame other choice spi
rits ripe for glorious mifehief. Anoli er (Noj)
matle its appearance in canfequenc* of the firit,
and is afcribcd to a Colonel John Mayo of this
place. And a third ( Ne. 3 ) said to have beeÂ«
put into circulation by a Mr, Wafinington and
some others'of Richmond.
E.-ipe&atios was wrought up to its highefl
pinnacle, and curiolity led many uonrelidents
likemyfelf te ihe place of political contelt. A
bout II o'clock, a large croud having afiemWed
at the court-houre, and as many as could, hav
ing prelTcd into it, (among whom I was one,
not being of that dei'criptjon of people who are
generally said to go to the wall) in a few mi
nutes a grey headed man drefied in black, with
a molt solemn gluom on his countenance arose,
and I thought the bulinefs of the day was to be '
commenced by prayers to the Deity to guide i
them in their deliberations, and to inspire them ]
with wifdora ; but on enquiry of an inhabitant
of the town near me, I found this was no other
than Mr. Futee himfelfâ" And," added ray in- j
formant, " a danm'd fine, purs democrat lie is ;
he'loves the French belt of all the people upon 1
the earth, and if our Congress Ihould be iuch 1
fools as to go to war with them, and
tliey Ihould fend an army here, he would be
worth a Jews eye to them" ... Mr. Fateetheu )
made a motion that an old white headed gen- t
tleman, (a Mr. Adams I think J Ihould take the (
chair, and that a secretary (hould bcappointtd.
Upon this \ genteel looking man got wp and atl- c
dressed the people, advised tliem against pro- '
ceediug at all in the business j hut if ihey were 1
determined to go on, he hoped they would at t
[ least adjourn to a place where the whole of the t
people might hear what was to be said, Tb.s i
was agreed to snd they adjourned to the flrjet
in frt nt of the court.house. t
1 enquired of my new acquaintance who this r
ger.tlemsn was, aadwas told it was Col. Mayo,
" not half so good a democrat as the other, nor 1
half so much attached to the French, but," ad- t
ded he, "hei. a damu'd pepperijh fort of a fel- ;
low, and it will net do to tell lA>Â» so, for I took
notice he had piflols in his holders when he C
came hereto-day. Having now got fairly in- T
to the ftrect, Mr. Futee mourned Â»pon a fart of '
a platform in front of a house near the court- f
house, and from thence began a violent, inflam- t
matory, uncouÃcdted fpeecli, full of inveilivea- 7
gainst the American, a; ofealogy oh the French
government, and then read, and offered to the C
people for their adoption* a set of rtfolutions 3
much in the stile of his speech. 2
This jacobiuical orator via succeeded by a F
little man whole name, as I understood from 1 e

a decided majority of the meeting, among whom
were two thirds of the decent looking people,
followed him- I then thought they were done,
at least for this day, but Mr. Futee with true
French zeal rallied the tattered remains of his
forces and again begin to exhort them, which
luring done, a small delicate looking man who
I was told was a Mr. Walhington, addrefied
' them from the platform in a very handsome
" fpeedi, and another sett of resolutions was offer
ed, of an entirely different cohiplexiori from th'e
'' firÃ, but from what sentiments 1 could discover
in the refpeiflable looking part of the people
c they did not wilh to accept any. I was amazed,
' however, M.*. Fenno, to find the appearance of
e prejudice in fume against this clever little man
.* only because his name is Walhington. Now,
Sir, if be was to go out into our country to prac
,e tice law (for 1 know he is a lawyer by his ad
e dre/Cng bitnfelf to "gentlemen of the jury")
s that name would be a recommendation to him,
especially if he is of the fame flock with the good
old general. But to return âMr. Walhingtoa
1 having finifhed, and some oth*r gentlemen hav
' iug made a few observations, up pop'd Mr.Fu-
tee again, and ran the fame ground over and
over; just like a horfs running four mile heats,
and seemed disposed to have continued his repe-
P titions until night, if he could have got lilleners ;â¢
; but the grog beginning to circulate (this bring
eledlion day too) the love of that drowned the
love of country, and afforded Mr. Futee in op
j- portunity of playing Â«ff a most capital piece of
e generallhip, lor as fion as that precious beverage
had deprived any poor fellow of the fcaiity lhare
(.freafoh.with whi.-hn .tuiejtjdorig'naliyendow
-1 edhim.thefe resolutions weie offered him to sign,
and if he was too drunk to hold the pcÂ», or did
not know how to writs at a"!l| they would do
. him the favor to f:gn for him. Thus did ma
s j ny men and boys, of various celours and defcrip
-3 tiens, write this day who never wrote before,
and perhaps never will again, unless in the fame
j manner ... by proxy- I tnufl r.ot forget to tell

his country by every tie of nature, for cau

yourfclves hereafter disapprove.
Let me alk yon, gentlemen, if there sail
be a doubt on your mind*, that your repre

such measures as will tend to the prefcrvati

if inftruaiens were necessary, 'pofTefled of
such information as to enable us to give
them ? l)o we not know, 011 the contrary,
that the houfc of representatives themselves
have been retarded in their deliberations 011
this momentous fubjedl, for want of infor

Belides, what right have <we,, who consti
tute but a ftnall part of she diftrifl, to give
inllruttions for our fellow-citizens of the

inftruftions to their reprefcntativea in coa

Some friends to the peace and fafety of

whether ' merica (hall go to war with France
but whether meafuree to protest the proper

It is therefore recommesded to the friends
of the American government, to attend the
meeting, in order by ?n expression of their
opinions, to counteradl the exertions of
those who may jwifh to defeat those measures
and thus to encourage further aggreflions,
to provoke war, and to endanger the securi

For the American Daily Advertiser.
To the Freemen of the City and County of Pbila
drlpbia.
My Countrymen,
THE Communications between our Go
vernment and Envoys at Paris are now made
known to the Public. The iituation in which
we are, is there clearly displayed ; the causes
which have Imj, to it Â»re pointed out ; and the
only means by which we can extricate our
selves trpm the difficulties'and dangers sur
rounding us on every fide plainly designated.
From them wi'lnay discover that we are up
on the eve of a war without having given e
veil the (hadow Of oft'ence j that demands
have been made of us which not only the max
ims of policy and the very exiltence of our in
-deneiidence but which even the principle of
common honesty forbid a compliance with 5
tliaf by the conteflion of the agents of France
themfclves (he "disregards the jultice of our
cl linis and the reafotjing which limy be brci't
in support of them ; that (he relies forfuc
cef's equally upon the greatness of her power
and the vicious 'efforts of her partizjns here ;
that in the opinion of our there
remains " no hope that the objetts of their
nijdion can in any way be accompl lhed
and tkat the only means by which our honor
can be secured i'rolu abjfement, our rights
trom prolfratioji, and our independence from
dedruclion is an unanimous, vigorous and in
deed delperute reliifance to -her frantic and
'unprincipled ambition.
It appears that the inffruftions given to our
Envoys inverted them with ample powers for
removing all the complaints which France
had made; that they generally coirtcided
with, aliho some refpevts they exceed
ed the recommendation contained in the ad
dress of the House of Keprefentat/ves to the
PreliJent at the last feflion of Congress ; that
in order to maintain peace compensation for
the injuries already done-to our commerce,
was not to have been infilled upon ; that all
the pretended advantages secured to Great-
Britain by the Britilh treaty,were to have be
come common to the Republic ; that those
which had been secured to us by our treaty
with her were to have been relinquilhed, and
a new one formed upon the broad balis of
jtlftice, equity, and the Laws of Nations;
thatEnvoysentrufled with offers so liberaland
pacific were not allowed even an official hear
ing ; but th it the unofficial agents of the Di
rectory(acknowledged to be such by theMi
ilfer of Foreign Relations) have told us, that
unlels our government would consent to prac
tice the arts of corruption, toalfeime uptin it
felf the debts which France owed to our owa
citi-ens ; and to make to her an immense loan
(he will not inform us of the terras 011 which
her insolenCe will condescend to make peace ;
that the plunder of our defencelefs merchant
men (hall continue ; that Friga;es from St.
Domingo fhal! ravage our coarts; and that
â¢our very habitations (hall be like Venice par
titioned among the conquering powers.
Filled with the alarm arising from the dan
gerous-situation of our country, a number of
C'tize'ns alfemoled at the house of John
Dunwoody, the evening before- the last.
This meeiing was compefed of men of all
political delcriptions. All former animosi
ties were there forgotten, and it was unani
mously agreed, that an address should be pre
sented to Cengrefs cxpreffive of the sense of
the people of the City and County of Phila
delphia on the present iituation of affairs ;
"â and declaring their fixed determination to
support, at every hazard, the rights, the ho
liorand the iridependencsofthe United State 6.
Softie measure of this kind was conceived
necelfary, in order to convince France and
the World that in defence of Our coun
try we were not divided ; and as Town
m;etings were unfit for coolness of de
liberation or freedom of difcuflion this was
thought the mod eligible plan we could de
vise. To this addrels your attefttion is now
caHed. Remember that it is not the effa
blilhnient of an abltrait theoretical point of
Government for which we are to contend, 1
but for the real and fubffantial enjoyment of |
our liberty and exigence as a nation ; and re- '
membertnat to contend with success for these
objeffs, without the poffefliOn of which life j
itfelf would be intolerable, Union and Vi
sor mud every where be the only order of
the day. MANEIUS.
MR. FENNO,
While enemies from without, and traitors
from within, qre devising the extirpation of j
â our molt facted rights, and robbing us of j
our property and inestimable privilegesâlt
isa most pleasing citcumfta*ce, to find our
Executive and Judiciary Departments, sup
ported by able, prudent and firm men.
â¢It was with the highest fatisfadion that I
heard, and I wifli I could recapitulate, the
masterly, seasonable, and animated address
of Judge Chase, delivered to the Grand
Jury of the United States, for the Difttid
of Pennfylvauia, on the 12th inft. With
a rtiailerly pencil, lie delineated the features
of our excellent constitution, the security it
aflbTded to onrliberties,theproteftion of inno
cence, and the dcte&ion and punishment of
guilt.âThe trial by jnry was noted as an
impregnable barrier of freedom and inde
pendence.
It was with the greatest propriety lemark
Â«l that the downfall of thetrial by jury, had
e?tr been the certain harbinger of defpo
Â«ifm. The cafesof the Northern Powers of
Europe were mentioned, as awful leflons for
our inftriiftion.
The explanation of the oath taken by ,
every grand-jury man, was certainly the
racft important part; man worthy 1
of the name, will consider it as an ineftw
mtblelofs tohimfeh", the public, and pqf- .
teriiy, if such in able, and seasonable pro- (
dud on, on that foit mn fubjefi, shall remain
fhnt up in the portfolio of the idgeniotis
and judiciou* author. When I repeat a con
cluding fi-ntence it may give some idea of
the general import " do to others the fame,
a3 you wifli that they in a like cafe should
do to you." It is with regret th :t I men
tion my inability to reptat what I most
earnestly with to be indelibly imprefled on
the heart of every juror.

sir,
The v f'lofures which you have made of
the Inftruftions given to our Envoys to
i 1 ranee and the Dispatches received from
| them, evidence a strong determination to
promote and preserve a good understanding
with the French Republic, provided it
1 could he accomplished without affeftirig our
â¢ national charaÂ£ter and the Independence of

J proof of your attachment to your country
' nor your unremitted attention to the duties
of your high and responsible filiation. We
, are well convinced that the conduit of our
government 10 all nations has been jull and
honorable, and we wi(h to express in the
strongest terms our confidence in it.
Jt is true, Sir, that there are some cha
rsfters in the United States who call them
selves Americans, and who with patnotifm
f on their lips and profeflions of regard for
the conftitutton of our country, are endea
voring to poison the minds of the well mean

ernment the support of the people ; their
rrieafures are hoitile to the happinefsof this
country and they arc the Instruments of
Disorganization and Sedition ; many of
1 whom are probably employed by that Na
-1 | tion, whofc Rulers seek the Dellru&ion of
America and the tendency of whofefyftem
is to exterminate from the World every mo

gentlemen,
I thank you for this addrefgâYour
approbation of the part I have taken, m an
intereiing negociation, gives me great plea
sure j but the conviftion you express, that
the conduft of our government to all na
tions, has been just and honorable, affords
me the highest fatisfa<Â£Hon. A nation which
is eonfeious of having done no wrong to
others, even when fuffering for a course of
years, tinder the provocations of a series of
insults, depredations and cruelties, may ap
peal to God, with a humble trust in his
blessing, and to the world, in a full afTurance
of obtaining its confidence
If there are perverfs characters who call
themselves Americans, I am well afTured
there have been greater numbers mere-ly er
roneous, deceived by partial information,
and transported by too ardent a zeal.
For myfelf, I have never entertained a
doubt, that the great mass of our fellow
citizens would support au administration
â which has nothirg in view but impartial
juftiee to all nations, and the charaÂ£tev,inde
pendenceand profpdrtty of the country: Nor
have I ever despaired of a unanimity of the
people in such sentiments, and in pursuit
of these objeÃsâAnd with you I humbly,
but firmly trust in God, we have nothing
to fear.
Under a Constitution like ours, the intel
ligence and integrity of Juries, in the legal
support of the government, are essential to
the preservation of its existenceâWith their
impartial countenance and faithful exer
tions, it can scarcely fail to answer the ends
of its institution, by confirming the fafety,
securing the honor, promoting the prospe
rity, and I will add, establishing the power
and advanciag the glory of the nation.
While Ijoin with you in your warmest
wiihes for the welfare of the United States,
I beg leave to allure you of mine, for the

States to restore harmony between the Uni
ted States and the Republic of France and
to establish a permanent and good under
llandipg between the two nations, as the
fame are fpecified in the iiiflrudions to the t
Envoys Extraordinary, have been wife, 1
just, liberal and fmcere ; and entitle him to f
the gratefulacknowledgmentsofhiscountry. 1

Tt*E ADDRESS
' And Memorial of the Citizens of Philadel
phia, the Diftridt oflSouthwark, and,
j. the Northern Liberties,
p Respects ully Sheweth,
i That your memorialing consider the pre
p| sent period as pregnant with events of the
| highest importance to the kappinefs andfafe
' ; ty of tire United States, ffnd thcr fore deem
: it an eflentiakand indispensable duty, to ex
' press, to the several branches of the Fede
-1 ral Government, the fentimeiU3 and deter
mination, which this extraordinary crisis in
their national affairs ha 3 inspired.
Appreci ting, with due estimation, the
' advantages of neutrality, and the bl. flings
of peace, your memorialists have beheld,
with entire fatisfa&ion, the earnest and re
iterated errdeavonrs of the government of
the United States to preserve this desirable
. positionâand they have seen, with corres
pondent concern, that the anxious advan
-1 1 ees, which have been made by the govern
' ment of the United States, towards a ref
utation of harmony with the republic of
' France, have been received with a marked
difference of disposition on the part of that
governmentâand that, in the very thres
hold of discussion, they have been treated in
'a manner, which could not fail to revolt e
very feeling of individual pride and national
independence.
Your memorialists learn, with equal af
tonilhwept and alarm, that the firftilep to
wards negociation has been made under a i
menace that, in cafe ofrefufaltopay a heavy
and difgraceful tribute, as the price of
peace, the United States of America would
be exposed to share the fate of Veniceâ
accompanied by a ftlggeftion, that, as they
were 3 divided people, the esecution of the
menace was inevitable.
Your memorialists feel themselves enjoin
. Ed by every consideration of duty to their
, country, to themselves, and to posterity, to
repel.the infmuition, which thus attempts
to diflionor the Ameriuaa charafterâ-and to
expose the fallacy of the expectation on
which the threat, to extinguish the inde- j
pendenre of the United Stafes, is founded. !
Deeply impreflt-d by a sense of the blef- j
lings which they enjoy undÂ«;r the truly free |
an I equal government of the United Stat: s, ,
your memorialists, as members of this hap
py and highly favoured community, are dc. ;
termined, at evay hazard, to maintain their '
Fraedom and Independence.
With this inestimable obje'dt to guide 1
their deciflon, your memorialists declare,-
that as the condinS heretofore pursued by â 
the Executive Departrae it, to preserve
peace with foreign nations, merits and re
ceives their perfect and gratefulapprobation;
so their confidence in the Wisdom andpatrio
tifmof every branch ofthe Government being
complete, they pledge themselves firmly to
support every tncafure, which may hereaf
ter be thought necessary to secure the con
stitution, freedom, and independence of (.he
United States.

if (21 January O. S.) the anniversary or t!:^
jull puni!hment of the last king of (he
n French.
d The execution of the plan took place,
- from the next day ; the republicans of th-
Batavian convention, have, on that day f
-1 saved their country : thÂ«y have caufcd to
, be arretted those nietTibers of their bodyj
who by the intrigues which they carried on
d in order to prevent the completion of the

y mies of Holland, of France, and of liberty
!â¢ and so powerfully seconded the manoeuvres
t- of the government of England. There have
been proposed, and the purified convention
is have immediately adopted them, the founÂ»
>t dations of a constitution, free and wife,
1 which goes to the organization amongst
them of the Representative SyJlem, from
i. which the BataVian people expefts its liber

krio-.v hovv to unite sagacity to firmnefs and
to courage. Here are the detail* of this
important event.
The party of the patriots had gained
. strength for iome timr. The most influen

. This was an ail containing those gmfcral
. principles which, in the sense of the Bata

j ate formation of a provisory government.â-
e I The fignatureg soon multipliedâ-thoy cm
s braced the names of a great number of the

were given at 4 o'clock in the morni.ig for

the remainder of the Rcprefentatives were
