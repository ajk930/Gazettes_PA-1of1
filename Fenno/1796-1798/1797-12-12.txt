The/Speaker announced a communiea- 0
tion from the Treasury. department, vvhiqh c
he delivered to the clerk to be read. It f;
contained a report and estimate of the ap- ]
propriations which will he neceflarv for the v
service of the year 1798, and also an
count of the receipts and expenditures for ;
the year preceding the llt of Oftober, 1797. j
Ordered to be printed and referred to the %
committee of Ways and Means. I
The Speak-jr also communicated a report
from the Seci etary of the Treasury on the ?
memorial of Robert Hazkhurft, and otlicrs, t
merchants of Charlt'fton, (S. C.) complain
ing of the operation of the aft direfting all |
goods and wares imported from abroad, to ,
be wtfighed and gauged by an officer of the 1
custom-house, stating that this direftion in- ,
jurt-d the private property of individuals 1
who had heretofore had this privilege. The ,
Secretary recommended that no law ftionld 1
be p ffed on the fubjeft but that the matter
in difputc between the custom house and in- j
dividuals (hould be brought to a legal dcci
fion. Ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. Harper, from the -committee of ways
and means, reported that the committee had
taken into conlideration the resolution of the
house refpefting the {lamp aft, and had di
refted him to report in part. The report
flatei, that, as the Secretary of the Trea
sury had found it impossible to provide the
necefary machinery, dies, &c. for carrying
the aft into effeft at the time proposed (the
Ift of January next) he had omitted to
give the notice which was direftcd to be giv
en in each (late three months previous to its
taking place ; that, finding it will not be
fafe to fix the period at which the duty shall
take place earlier than the ift of July next,
thty recommend a law to be pasTed to that
effeft. They mention, that some other al-"
terations had been fnggefted as neceflary,
but they thought it necefiary to leave these
for future conlideration, as it would be prop
er to pass this aft a3 soon as possible. The
report was read a fccond time and referred
to a committee of the whole for to-morrow.
Mr. Shepard prifented the petition of A
braham Whitney, a colleftor of revenue,
praying for certain reimbursements. Re
ferred to the Secretary of the Treasury.
Mr. Macon, from the committee Â«f revi
fal and unfinifhed business, reported the laws
which will expire before the next meeting
of Congrefs.âReferred ,to a committee of
the whole.
Mr. Venable, from the committee te
whom was refew*dr lo whether any
and what alterations were necefiary in the
law refpefting silver coin, reported it as their
opinion, that a law (hould be pafl*ed autho
rising and requiring colleftors of revenue to
receive foreign silver coin, other than Span
i(h dollars and parts thereof, at the rtites at
which they were received before the 15th
day of Oftober lad, for two years, and from
thence to the end of the next feffien of
Congress ; and to suspend so much of the
aft as relates to foreign gold coin, for the
like time.
On motion to agree to the report (as it
was said to be in consonance with a circular
letter which had been sent to the Ctolleftors
from the Treasury department) it was mov
ed to be postponed, by Mr. Sitgreaves, to
Wednesday.âAgreed.
Mr. Holmes . presented the petition of
; -Richard Schott, a soldier in the war, for
compensation. Referred to the committee'
â¢ of claims.
Mr. Sewall, from the committee to whom
was referred that part of the speech of the
President of United States, which related to
the meafurts necefiary to be taken for the
. proteftion of commerce and the defence of
' the country, stated that that committee had
requested him to ask the fame leave for them
to report by bill or otherwise, which had
i been given to all the other committees ap
pointed at the fame time.
Mr. Nicholas thought the nature of this
resolution fully juftified the deviation which
~ had been observed in the forming of the re
solution appointing this committee. It ap
â¢, peared to him better to have the fubjeft in
E the form of a report, than a bill, in order
that it might receive full discussion.
Mr. Sewall said, it was not possible that
1. the committee conld bringforwardany thing
upon which the house would not have full
power to' aft, and if they were allowed' to
report by bill, it would considerably lefien
their labour, which was the principal objeft
e of the motion.
S Mr. Nicholas was not desirous of impof
l" ing unnecefiary difficulty or trouble upon a
ny committee ; but if the business was so
important, it was an additional argument for
- the house not only to eiamine the fubj'eft,
but the details. It was the praftice of the
house to have all important business firft in
the form' of a report, which gave time for
discussion arid refleftioni arid he thought afi
y innovation upon theufualorderofproceeding
i- in this refpeft might have a bad effeft. He
- wiflied before any projeft flionld be broflght
before them in a bill, they might discuss its
" principles.
5 Mr. Pinckney laid, the leave now asked,
was no more than had been allowed to all
>â¢ the other committees appointed to take in
" to confutation psrts of thÂ» President's
speech. He thought if a bill were report
ed, every opportunity would be given to
' obtain information on the fubjeft, as fuffi-
I cient time might be allowed betwixt the fe
-1 veral readings, and they could better explain
the nature of the regulations, with refpeft
to the duty of-ceikaor* at JjjK. fevcral p#itÂ«, npj
,by a bill thatf a repoi*>. bo,pci3,there- the
fore, asmuch trouble would be. laved by this for
mode of procedure, that the requelt of the m;
committee would be ecmplied with. fujj
Mr. Harper said, the reason why the form mi
of this resolution differed from the other of.
(was, beeaufe it was of a .very ext'enfive na- in
ture, noltfs than to take in'tp consideration ds
the (tieafares proper to be tiken for the pro- so
| teftion of our commerce and the defence of pr
I our country, which wis supposed would re- th
j quire previouselucjdationby a report,before of
j fpecific measures we're brought forward in wt
I the foilmof a bill. He had, however, no w<
j objections to comply with the re of the qu
i committee, as he believed they might be th
fafeljr jrufted with the discretion required, w<
â¢ Indeed it w;iÂ« iw>t.<;oiiteinplated,hebelieve<2, ;ny
I when the committee' was appointed, that jbe
â  j any thing refpc&tog COTeftovs, or colled- cc
' I ing of duties, wo\>ld have come within its fa
j purview ) but as they had thougjit othet- pi
: wife, jie-hoped the liberty theyafked Would a
|be granted.- - iol
; Mr. S. Smith said nothing had been said re
1 1 abouti collecting duties, but of the duty of w
> I collectors, with refpeft to J.he law of 1794- p !
â  I Mr. Gallatin would be glad to have far- tl
' I tiler information on this fubjeft. He wish- fj
' I ed to know whether what was meant to be |
â ' I brought forward refpefting the conduct of g
â  j collectors was mere matter of detail,or whe-j C
3 I ther it involved any new principle ; if it ir
: I were the former, he should not objeft to the | n
I I mode proposed, but if not, he should be a-' ft
r I gainst deviating from the usual mode of si
I procedure. j t<
- I Mr. Sewall said, the purpose which the v
I cpmmittee had in view wasto determine the : b
â  I question refpefting.the arming of merchant 1 t
I I vessels. Befori the last meeting of congress j d
e I it would berecolleft<fd.that the Prelident of b
- I the \Jnitrd States had issued orders to pre- a
t I vent the arming of merchants' veflels,except (
1- Jin certain cases. The committee were doubt- 1;
e ful whether there txifted any authority in v
g tlie Pre C.den( to jffue thefeorders, the exe- , c
e cution q{ which, had been opposed in vari- t
0 ous parts of the Uiuted States. This sub- g
'â¢ | jest had been under the consideration of the f
tÂ« committer, and they thought it more expe- t
>e dlent to report in detail, the regulations ne- i
II ceffary,in the form of a bill, than to report
t, in any othu/onu. â If the house wished the j
it business to be done otherwise, they would, Â«
l-'l of course, refufe a compliance with the re- j
f, quest. I
fe I Mr. Veiwble said, from the flatements' c
3- which had been made it appeared that the \
>e I committee had had two fubjefts under con- I
-d I fideration, one of which had been referred
to them, and the other not ;as if they wish- 1
L- ed to blend them together, and to bring in (
e, I a bill at their discretion The committee 1
e- was appointed to rfport what means would i
I be the bell to be taken for thÂ® protection of ;
'- our commerce,j but the fubjeft which they <
's had brought before the house was, whether 1
g thf-revenue officers of the United States 1
if had performed their duty in refpeft to an !
exiftinjr,l^^vh^JÂ»i?V 3 a diftinft thing, and 1
:Â® I entirely-writ of- tbtC'fefereug* which had been '
iy | made to them. iV the rtvenue officers had 1
Â»e I atted improperly, it was a fubjeft necefTary
if 1 to be enquired iirro, on information being
3- I received through a proper channel. The
:o I attention of she committee ought to be con
n- I fined to the business referred to them, and
at I they should report accordingly. He was
th 1 opposed to ,the motion, fipce, it was wholly
m I contrary, to the praftice of the house to go
of I into details, before tHey had fettled tjie prin
he ciple upon which they were about to aft.
he I Mr. Gallatin believed, when this commit
tee was appointed, it was not intended that
it I it should have the power of reportingbybill.
ar I The business of the other fix committees ap
Â»rs I pointed at tjie fame time, and to whom this
>v-1 power was given, were wholly different in
to I their nature from this. [He read the dif-
I ferent refolutions.il The principle of the
of I objefts upon which these committees were
or I appointed to aft, had already been more or
:ee I less fettled in the house ; but what was the
I business of this committee ? It was n6 less
>m I than tÂ« report the meafurts proper to be ta
he I ken for the protection of our commerce and
to I the defence of our country. The Preiident
he I in his fpeefh, had fpolten at large on these
of I fubjefts [Mh Gallatin read an extraft from
ad I thq address if the Pfi-fident.] This refer
fm I fereifce, be embraced all the objefts
iad I which had engaged Meattention of congress
tp- during their extraordinary session ; it did
I not only iricfifdfc armin'g of vessels, but also
his the raising of armies, building of a navy, a
ch resting ofarienals, &'C. that so far from giv
re-1 ing this committee farther power, he tho't
ap-1 thi power .already git-en them was too great,
in 1 and that the fubjeft should firft have beeft
der I discussed in a committee of the whole oh the
state oft he unionâWhenprinciplesofthis im
hat portance were to be established, the business
ng should be fettled in the house. He should,
Pull therefore, be wholly opposed to granting
to the liberty required.
ren Mr. Rutledge did not think the commit
eft tee had exceeded their powers in taking
this fubieft under their consideration. They
iof- had rrothing to do with the revenue officers;
1a- they would, of course, shew that the provi
;fo fio'ns already ( made refpefting the arming of
for merchants* veffefs, had proved inadequate.
:ft, Orders, it 'wis well'known, had been iflued
the by the df the United States to
in prevent the arming of veflels ; but,' in ma
for ny inftane'es, these orders had been protested
afi against. Preljdent had said merchants
ing should thefr yeffels ; the merchants
He had the P'refelent had no authority to
jht forbid tliem. He thought this business
its should be lqoked adjufted ; and he
di(l not t-e upÂ«n wfiat ground gentlemen
ed, could charge the committee with bringing
all forward projrÃs [Mr. Nicholas here inter
in- rupted Mr. R. and faidte had no particular
it's meaning in uftng the wordprojetl.] Mr. R.
irt- said if there were any <proj(B irihand, he was
to unacquainted with it. He had not been in
ffi- the hpufe loug enough to lenow whether the
fe- praftice of reporting by bill was novel; but
ain he believed it was not.
eft Mr. Sitgreaves said, the intent of the
appointment of Seleft Committees Â«rjÂ», th it bp!
they should produce flifts and lay them be- ing
fore the House in a collefted view; they ed
might properly be called the Pioneers of chf- thn
ftijjion. The belt mode of doing this, <K>m- anc
mittccs themfclves muitbethe beit judges 001
of. Some fubjefts would be belt prefentcd It
in the abftraft ; others would require to bsi tlu
detailed. Stippofe two cases, said he, be- bic
fore a committeeâthe one a proportion for
private, the other for public arming. If hir
the committee should propose the building hai
of more vessels .at the public expenoj, this
would be unconnected with any detail; ic thi
would be a Bogle queltiort, and would re- on
quir: no light from the committee ; but if ful
j the fubjeft was a Pri,ate Armameni, a pian fid
! wotild require tiÂ» he detailed, before a judg- ed
: ment could be givÂ«?n upon it ; as it would at<
i be proper to be permitted or reltriCted, ac
cording to circumltaoces. The committee, m;
said he; on this acÂ»ount, alii tu have the rel
power to present the present bufinefj in fueh
a view as to give the House the belt means la'
los determining on their proportion. The it
requelt ought, therefore to be complied mi
with, since they are the belt judges of the pi
proper mode of prefrnting the fubjeft, as pa
they alone are fully poflefled of the fafts re- ti<
fpefting it. 1 M
! Mr. N. Smith was surprised that any M
gentleman should be opposed to giving the b<
! Committee leave to report by bill ; because, d<
: | in doing this, they could not possibly do a- th
:; ny harm, though they might give them- so
â  f selves unneceflary trouble. The gentleman er
: from Pennsylvania (Mr. Gallatin) seemed ft
| to think the principle could not be discussed pi
: when a fubjeft was in the form of a hail;' di
: j but this was not the cafe. It was true that c<
11 the principle of a quefiion was frequently fc
> | determined before a bill was brought in ; al
F but it might just as well be done afterwards j al
- and if the principle were objefted to, the >
t Committed would, of course have loft their p
- labour. He thought when a Committee r-.
1 wefe willing to risk this trouble, *he-Houfe k
- , could have no reasonable objeftion to ir; It p
- might be, as had been represented by the It
- gentleman last up, that the principle of a t<
e fubjeft could not be judged of, without b
- the detail ; when a Committee fortfaw. this, b
- it was certainly their duty to report in detail, tl
t Mr. Thatcher did not understand the tl
e ground upon which this motion waÃ oppof- f<
, ed. It was certainly no new praftice. The si
- pkn for eltablifhing a new militia system, f
had been reported iti a bill, as an illustration t
s' of the report. He bopÂ«d the Committee c
e would be allowed to report their detail iti a 11
- bill. ' Â£
i Mr. J. Williams was opposed to a report c
- by bill. The powers granted to th is t
n Committee, be said were very extensive. t
e which would be discussed, and adopted, and 1
d a bill ordered to be brought in, or rejected, ]
if as was thought proper. The Committee a
y of ways and Means had thefubjeft of Revet
r nue generally referred to them; they gave 1
:s their opinion, from time to time, as to the ;
n Weft mode of railing revenue, but they had (
d no general pow-r given them to report by 1
n Ir9i â ; tic Injpeil the fame course would be ;
d observed by this Committee. â >â j
y Mr. Nicholas (having obtained leave tÂ« t
g rife the third time) said this question was <
e important, not only as it related to the bu
-- finefs before the house, but with refpeft to ]
d their general proceedings. The gentleman
is from Massachusetts (Mr. Thatcher) had â 
y spoke of a bill accompanying a report, in the i
;o cafe of the militia system, as an illustration I
l- of it. If this would fatisfy the Committee, ,
they could do this in the present cafe. He
t- was surprized that the gentleman from Penu
lt fylvania(Mr. Sit greaves) should not confi
-11. der this an abftraft queftibn. At the last
p- feffion,'it had been considered as an abftraft
is question, and rejefted. And could any
in gentleman fay, that at this time, when our
f- conneftion with the world is much happier
le than it was fix months ago, this question
rc ought not to be considered abftraftedly ?
or What, said he, should we have thought of
he the committee, if they had asked for leave
'fs to bring in a bill to build ships of the line;
a- to ereft fortifications ; to raise armies, &c.?
id Wpuld ihefe propositions have been coniid
nt ered as mere matters of form.? On the
'fe contrary, would not the honfe have revolted
m at such a proceeding? They certainly
;r- would. They would have thought it pro -
sts -per, firft to- h9tÂ«T enquired whether'-our
;fs means were adequate to efftft these fehetSes.
lid Yet they were, all at once, aflced for this
so power, by the present propofltion. In the
a- last session, the house proceeded very d'ffer
iv- ently. A ref&lution was laid upon the table
>'t and committed to a committee of the whole
it, and there fully discussed, and solemnly rtjeft
efi ed ; but they were now inclined to treat the
he business with more levity. He trulted,
m- however, the house would net consent to
ess this mode of ptoceeding.
Id, Mr. Otis said the present motion was op
ng posed on account of its novelty, though he
believed the novelty would more properly
it- attach to the opposition. He believed there
tig never had been an inflance, whether the
ey fubjeft was of great importance or other
rs; wife, in which, when a ltqueft like the pre
vi- sent had been made that it had been refufed.
of Was it then right, because such a propafiti
te. on was made, to speak of the movers of it,
led as if they were about to propose the build
to ing of a Naval Force, or the ranging of ar
na- mies in battle array ? He thsught not, and
ted infiftcd upon the propriety of the proposed
nts privilege being allowed; which hie believed,
nts so far from being used improperly, would
to be the means of kee ping out of view the ab
efs ftraft question of arming, which was not
he necefl'ary at present to be touched,
icn Mr. Isaac Parker wa3 in favour of grant
ing ing the leave asked for, as it appeared to him
er- to have been the praftice of the house.
lar Mr. Varnum infilled upon it that it had
R. never been the praftice of t!Â«e house to take
V2S up great national questions, until the prin
-lin ciple had been decided upon in committee
the of the whole. It had been faia leave had
but never been refufed in a fimilareafe ; but he
believed it had never been aficed. It was
the well known there was a great difference ot
opib'ibn iu the house on the fabjocl of arm
ing. The President had again recommend
ed to them, all the measures with tefpett to
that business, that he had before suggested,
and they were about to give the power to a
committee to report bills upon all of them.
It had laid 'oy a gentleman before him
that the President had done wrong in for
bidding the arming of vessels.
Mr. Rut]ed'ge denied having so expressed
himfelf; he hud said that the Merchants
had said so.
Mr. Varntim observed it was insinuated
the President had been wrong iij.iffuing the
order ; and if a bill was brought in on the
fubjefk he supposed the conduct of the Pre
sident would be impeached by it. He trilft
ed* therdfor? this business would not origin
ate in the form of a bill-
Mr. Dana was ready to give the Gentle
man last up due credit for his solicitude with
refpeft to the President of the United States
âbut he could not be ignorant that thfe
law was doubtful as to its conftruftion, and
it was proper that this doubt (hould be re
moved ; and would it, he alked, be any im
putation on the conduft of the President to
pass a law to fay what was the true confiruc
, tion of the former law ? Certainly not
i Mr. Dana referred to what had fallen from
. Mr. Nicholas in objection to the buSuefs
being introduced by a bill ; there was no
doubt, he said, but, if that were the cafe,
that gentleman's ingenuity could introduce
something to produce a difcufikm o* fuffici
ent length, as it would he recolle&ed he had
fumifhe&a debate of three weeks by a finglc
propofitioi) to amend an answer to the Pre!i
---dtnt/s address at the last feflion. He was
confident 1 that as the committee had aflced
for leave to report by bill, it ought to be
allowed, and denied that the prefsnt was an
I abftraft question. v
i Mr. Gallatin allowed that it had been the
pra&ice of the house to grant the power to
report by bill, when it was aficed ; but he
knew of ho instance where a committee, ap
pointed for general purposes, had a (Iced tkis
leave.; They had several (landing commit
tees ; but they never came forward at the
beginning of a feflion to a(k leave to report
, by bill. He had already said that he tho'c
this committee improper, and he repeated
â  that at no time did he tecollecl business of
so important and general a nature being ri
fered to a feleft committee ; the proper rt
, ference would have been to a committee of
i the whole on the state of the union. As this
: committee had been appointed, he (hould
i not now, however, move to have it dischar
ged. If it were were wished to report a bill
t on the fpecific fubjeft mentioned, if the mo
s tion was so expressed, he (hould nob objeft
. to it. In regard to the general proposition
1 he did not with to feg it at present discussed
, He believed the fate of the present negad â¢,
f ation mud decide the opinion of the house
- on this fubjedfc. If it terminated as they all
e hoped, the fubjeft of arming would riatnr
e ally drop ; but if not, and the depredation!
i on our commerce were contmned, tlreie
f would be no difference of opinion about
e mfrrUant vessels, at lea 11 if rf<it
going further. He wiiheel, therefore, that
Â® this fubjeft might not at present come un
s der difculfion.
i- Mr. Thatcher again spoke at confidera
o bis length in favour of the motion,
n Mr. Findley was opposed to this mode of
d proceeding. It was cutting off a part of t
e their deliberations on important matters, and
n he (hould beCorry to fee the ordinary mode
of doing business. in this refpedt, changed,
e Mr. S. Smith was aertain, it thecommit
i- tee had forefeen that this motion could have
t- produced so long a debate, it would not have-.
ft been made. They thought it the best, way
ft of bringing the business before the House;
y he was indifferent which way it was done,
ir Before the last feflion, he said, the Prefi-
ST dent had issued orders to prevent the failing
>n of any-amud vtffels, except to the East In
â¢ diesCongrefs took up the fubjedt, and
:>f it seemed to be admitted, on all fides, that
'e there was a natural defence in Merchants to
prevent their vessels being taken. The sub
â  â¢ jest of the President's order was taken into
-1- consideration; and he believed it was gener
ic ally allowed that th* President was.not au
:d thorized by law to ifiue this orde-. This
ly being the general opinion, it was conceived
>â - by Merchants tint ! thcy might, as heretÂ»-
Jr fore, arm tlieir vessels in their own defense.
s - â>â Some (hips, however, attempting to
is clear out, were (topped by the Colle&ors.
Ie A new order was issued by the President,
r- which gave a further privi'ege of armijg
le vessels to the coast of Africa. Injurious
h consequences had arisen from this. He
knew a vessel which failed from the .United ,
le States to the coaft'of Africa, armed, for gold
d, dust and ivory, which wasattackÂ«<d by a-liri
to tifh armed vessel, but instead of being taken,
(he took the Britilh vessel. The confe
p- quence was, the captain was prosecuted for (
tie pirafcy and thrown into gaol. This, Mr,
ly Smith said, was a breach of neutrality,
re which called for a law to prevent it.
he The Committee thought they could effect' .
r- the business in the belt manner by a bill, and
*- therefore aflced leave to bring it in. Mi
d. Smith was of opiniun Merchants had-a right
ti- to arm their vessels, and he thought this
it, right was countenanced by the act for pro> ,
d- hibiting the exportation of arms, as anna
ir- on board of merchants vessels, for the pui

For/he Gazette of the United States.
Mr. Fenno,
The inclosed Translation of a Petition from
the real Merchants of Nantesto the French
Council of Five Hundred, relative to the
capture of American vefiek, may ufeful
ly fill a column in your paper.
THE UNDERSIGNED,
Merchants, Mariners, and Citizens,
of the Commune of Nantes,
To .the Covfcn ef Five Hvndhed.
litprtftniatiws of the Peoplr,
A petition has been "presented to you en>-
titled : " Tie Merchants, owners of Priva
teersyond Mariners of the Commune of Nantes. I
to tie Counut nf Five Hundred to pray you
to fix in a t>ofiti\* manner the political and com
metciat rilotions -which exifl hetiueen I-ranee
aid the United States, and to put an end to the ,
diverPty of optnhfu mami fled on this important
oijfUj either hy the Executive Directory and ,
judiciary authority j or even in the bifim of the \
Legislative Body.
If those who signed this petition had pre- j
fented it only in their names, we should have ,
been silent ;'bnt feeing they have taken the |
collective name of the merchants, owners of
privateers and mariners of the Commune of
'Nantes, the undersigned who also form a
part of those classes of citizens in the com
mune of Nantes, and who do not partake
of the opinion #E the petitioners in divers ef
- fcntisl points,' think it their duty to tell
with that franknefs which becomes repub
licans,-in what they differ from them.
We as well as they desire peace ; but w
think it a Grange way of accelerating it by
iirovokinga war against ,a friendly nation.
They make a long and eloquent enumera
tion of atrocities and crimes, commited by
individtial Americans against French citizens,
and they would wi/h to render the Ameri
can government responsible for them ; af
terwards they think it veryjuft that other
innocfiit individuals should be puuifoed for
the injuries which they have wrongfully im
puted to the government.
The third for gold has without doubt at
all times caused many crimes to be com
mitted â¢, every nation has its villains : all
that a government can do, is to have them
punished according to the law, when it fur
nifties the means of overtaking them.
Declamations are not proofs. It is not
fufficient to speak when one is not afraid of
being contradiaed. The two parties must
6e heard, and impartial justice ought to
preside at the difcuflion of fafts often exag
erated and perverted by interested accusers.
The petitioners confounding, as they per
ceived it ufeful to their cause, some Ameri
cans, with the Americans, that is to fay, in
dividuals with the government, reproaches
the latter with having fed us with bad meals
at exorbitant prices.
Nevtrthelefs we know how thele meals
xvere furnifhed. The _ French government
had them brought by its own ag ents ' ?' h Â°
mandates on the treasury Â»;t tne United
States, eager in our distress to reimburle us
a debt not yet due : the American govern
ment had no other part in these purchases
than that of paying lor them, and it the
meals were "bad of which we are ignorant,
certainly the government was not to blame.
As to those which the Americans brought
into our potts, we likewise know that they
were aim oil almost all taken or bought by
the functionaries of the government. 1 heie
functionaries did hot buy on samples ; the
commodities themselves were under their
eyes ; they could refufe the bad-- and they
conftaritly did so here 5 or all that was found
d.rrug:d on inferior, was Vajflrd by arbitra- to
tars. ' w
WÂ« are notlefs ignorant that at St.Qo- of
â mingn, the prices of meals from the United ar
States, were fixed by the commhTionaries of A
our government.
If the fellers have endeavored to obtain m
high prices, they have only done what eve
ry merchant and the petitioners themselves
would have done in their place. Every cap
tain chooses the market which he thinks the
moll favorable for the sale of his cargo.
They deceived themselves in this refpeft the
daft year, and loft more than they had gain
ed the preceding ( I) w
Here we fee what this heavy charge con- g
cerning meals amount to. c ,
Not being able to speak with ins jrmation
on the cause of the other accusations, which
have also for their balls only the ill conduit
of individuals, transformed into complaints
againftthe government, we it to $
the accused to refnte them ; but not to be j
unjust we must hear them. They will fay j'
without doubt (and they wiU prove it) that
at New-York and at Philadelphia, the in- ~
habitants made conliderable fubfenptions to
succour the poor refugees of .our colonies ; -
that congress voted them succours, and that
in general they were received with humani
ty and benevolence. Thefc proceedings as
! well of the government as of individualswill
| hold the counterpoise in the balance of c
quity, against accufat ions of hard hearted- 11
nefsand injustice, which after some isolated '
examples they would cad upon them. (2) )
We shall not discuss their treaty with En
gland, Ws'ltiift examine whether, depriv- c
ed of a naval force, and having no fuceours '
to hope from ours, they could have refufed '
it : we must likewise examine, whether it a- j
greed with their liberty and their political
fitnation, even with refpeft to us, to main- 1
tnin a naval force. This research is foreign '
to onr present objeft. What we lhall per
â  mit ourfefves to fay on the fubjeA of this
ti**ty,4Â», that if, in lb* place of a frank i
and friendly explanation, or of aa open rup
ture, it had only provoked the decree of the 1
, Dire&ory of the' 11 Ventore (3 ) ; that mea
sure appears to us partial, precipitate, con
' tradiftory and inefficient.
It is partial ; inasmuch as it affeÂ£ts indi
' viduals for the most part innoceot, whose
property it confifcates to the profit of thofc
1 of our privateers which have the easy ad
vantage of taking people who did not mis
trust us.
It is precipitate ; inasmuch as it orders the
â  sudden and immediate execution of a regu
lation which ought to have been fignified to
the American navigators, before fubjeding
1 them to the penalty of contravening it, It
1 is certain none of them fufpedled they should
e have need ef a role d' equipage in the for
malities prescribed in that decree. The
treaty of 1778 fays nothing of the role ; it
only mentions a paflport, and the farmule
to which the article XXVII of the treaty
, refers, seem to have required no more than
the fame paflport, by means of which all
the previous formalities are supposed to have
been fulfilled.
.It is true our most celebrated lawyers have
different opinions on thefenfe ofthisformule;
t , | this prcves at least that it is not clear ; and
u if they do not agree in this refp*&, how can
1. j we require that the Americans, who but
~ imperfectly understand our language, bebet
m ter informed ? finally, why did we not give
lt ; them notice that they did not conform to
d \ the rule, at the time when they brought
' 7e provisions, and performed our coaftiug fer
j viee ? Ought men then so well received, to
c . ! exped, all at once, in 11s to find enemies,
, e ' without a declaration of war ?
le j The mcafure. is contradiÃory ; the Ameri
-9f can captain who is/ortunatf toen
0f ter our ports, without meeting our corsairs,
aj is received there like a friead: but if he has
n . the misfortune to meet them, he is captured
- e and condemned ; thus it is sometimes the iu
f- terval of an hour and chance which decides
â U his treatment !
Finally it is inefficient; it ought to hinder
fraud, and it will only serve the better to
cover it. The truly guilty will have been
, y the firft to shelter themselves ; and even the
innocent will not have been exposed to it
a _ much longer. The decree is so generally
,y kuown wow, that every one takes care to
~ conform to it; it will Coop have only the bad
r j! success of having carried ruin and desolation
if. inio a great number of Ametiean families ;
er of having finifhed the losses of some of our
or own colonists who had laden she wrecks of
n . their fortunes on board the csptured vessels;
of having mutilated the fortunes of many
at merchants of Holland, Hamburg, Bremen
and others of our allies, to whom these vef
ill fcls were carryingthereturns of their debtors
, m who will have no more means of paying
lr . them ; in fine of alienating and reftorirTg to
onr enemies, perhaps tor a generation, all
ot the affeaion of a nation, a great part oi
of which was sincerely devoted to us.
Ah ! our brave corsairs have no reed of
to this fatal encouragement to search our real
~ enemies with ardour and intrepidity, and
- 3 well may the captains, as well as their own
â¢r'. ers and Stockholders, lament a regulation so
r j_ contrary to their way of thinking, but to
n _ which they cannot refufe to conform.
cs Such are, Citizens Reprcfcntatives, our
jl s sentiments on the objedt of the_ petition
which 1 has been presented to you ; they dif
j]s fer too much from those of the petitioners
nt not to be msinifefted.
ho Finally, we join our prayer to theirs, that
you will weigh in your wisdom the measures
us .to betaken to prevent a rupture_ between
n- two people made to be ftriftly united, and
fes (r). The French merchants experienced pr cife^y

DUEI.
Yesterday morning a meeting took place p
in Hyde-Park' between Cel. Fitzgerald, and f t
the Hon. Col. King, brother to the j
young lady whose eloptttwnt has been for t |
some davs the principal topic of converfati- ,|
on in the metropolis.âAfter difeharoing j
three cases of pistols each without efteÂ£l,Col. f]
F very quietly put on his great'coat, v
and left the field : neither party, We under- a
(land, had any more ammunition, which was e
the occasion of their parting ia the above
manner ; we may therefore expeSbto hear n
fomethitig more of it. ) r
Relative to this event*, a morning paper j
gives the following particulars a
The unhappy cÂ»ufe of this meeting isTe- -{.
cent In the public mind. Coiy-R. 'K. came p
to town from Ireland on Friiliylartj' tff tie- t
m'and fatisfaftion for an irreparable injWy'to
his family. ;
Major W. his second, -rtith much difficul- ]
ty, obtained an interview with Col. F. to j
whom he delivered a nieffage from Col. K. g
intimating that he came to punish him for r
the greatell violation of the principles of B
honor and decorum ; thÂ® l filler, th* (
Hon, Miss K. aHd family, had sustained the ]
greatest outrage and perfidy ; and that al- ,
though the aggreflbr was not entitled to the {
honorable claims of society, yet that he
fhouldhave an opportunity of making a de
fence in the fifcld. Col. F. without the ,
smallest hesitation, accepted the challenge, ,
and the contest terminated as we have alrea- ,
dy described. " i
As soon as the affair had transpired, Col. ,
Stephens ordered Col. F. to be pirt under (
arrest.
Col. K. it the brother of the unfortu
nate young lady who was lately feducedfrom
her mother'#, and about whose ftofy 'the
. public tias for feme weeks boqn so conver
sant.
Lord Kingfborongh, and his brother -
i George King, arrived on Thurfidqy m
town from Ireland. The latter attended at
the Mount Coffee-houfe on Friday
. and part of Saturday, in hopes of n?ee\ing
, with Col. F.
t The Nobleman alluded to, when a school
boy, married the only daughter of a Col.
, Fitzgerald, by wfobm he obtained an estate
of 20,0001. a year. His lordfiiip hij a
humerous family, and his eldert daughter is
Countess of Mountcafhel. Col. K. fervid
the greater of the lafl wat in America.
The relatives of the young lady, as may
g be naturally supposed, are in the mod de
] plorable (late of mind. They have expeti
enced an unpardonable breach cf hofp.tali
-5 ty âThe charafter of a very amiable daugh
ter has been left to the bitter' aggravation

' s of ourJhips_ and cargoes were Englifb property
ie and that the pafports of the President were
lublicly fold in England for Enghjhfhips :
How he got the information, or how well
founded,you, at the d'JUnceyou arefrom French

i- own part, tho as refpeils French affairs I ne

II delicateâit is thus that / venture to fay that I
>- much doubt whether the reception of the com

:, Mr. Pinciney. Had they arrived two months
ie ago, perhaps matters refpeSing America, might
I. have gone rightââ but I now fear they have

it condemn her : the captain and crew were com

political charader, yet when very fcrupu
ed loufly exercised towards the adminiftraters
en of government, it may tend to lesson the
of confidence of a people in their rulersâand
in we view with regret and indignation the fac
tes tious clamour for the deftruflioti of our

" As the eonflitution of that government

adopted after a candid discussion, and upon
mature deliberation, without yiolence ur tu

fidence in the officers of our own choice, and
willingly afford effeftive aid to that govern
ment which we have inllitutcd for the com
mon good; the beneficial effedts of the con
stitution of the United States has been gen
erally felt, and acknowledged to be far grea
ter than was at firft expected. A spirit of
enquiry into the principles of a government
and the mode of its adminiilration pertains
to a fiee people: But when that spirit be
comes intemperate, and its design is to pro
mote opposition, to divide and weaken the
government, it may embolden foreign pow
