not coiiiider it improper, to certify the Chief

now joy. Whilst a desolating war rages among
allec- na *ions of Europe, and daily threatens
b'nes t<? ' nvo ' vel,s a " its calamities, wc; believe,
looks tbat unity, under the gracious protec

irious of defence. Impressed with the importance
they of this sentiment, we allure the rulers of our
ifing countiy, that we will use oar bed endeavors
to promote unity of opinion, refpett for the
W1 " laws, and reverence for all.that are in autho

TUEoDAY EVENIN'G, DECEMBER i 3.
I'lio towering views of Gallic ambition
â whx'.i acquired a new stimulus to further
darirt;; from every added luccefs, have at
lep;tli be.n completely cruttied undt* the
weight of her r/.oft hated foe ; and from those
dreams of universal dominion with which
this nation cf philosophers were lo long a
mused, they wake to ignominy and flia'me.
Their national glory funk forever, and the
vital e fit nee of their power, 101 l in the ag
grandizement of a few servile ruffians.
France was a fair pifture, rich in the rnoft
beautiful and variegated landscape. The
hand of the cruel spoiler hath deformed the
whole, and nothing now is left but the out
* line. Like the variegated hues of a stag
nant pool, that fair and extensive profpeft
she prelents externally, Confifb within of
foul corruption, the very dregs yaf mifcrv,
and fjed? of death. Such are the effects of
revolutions.
The controversy about the Century lias
fh'fted its theatre to Norfolk in inia,
w' ere, as here, the absurd notion of prema
tura! v dating it, by cutting off twelve months
from its period, is f;:ecef-!'uHy exploded. A
friend of mine adduces an analogical argu
ment, which wruld have wsight, if it were
wanted. He is a h hifforical, philo
fophicai and pciitical disquisition on the e
vents ot the prefjnt Century, and being en
gaged at present on the French kou/everse
ment, his ardent an&iety to enregifter on its
annals, the deno' ement of that bloody dra
ma along with its commencement and pro
gress, naturallv encreafes as he advances with
his fubjeft, and is the advance of tlie aftors
towards this deiireable iffÂ®, daily feives
ffronger and stronger hopes of its accomplilh
ment.
All a~es, and all forms of government, \
have abounded in conspiracies ; and if these
have sometimes produced beneficial results,
they have never been derived from the cal
culations of the. conspirators. But our own
has been remarkably fertil- in the production
of conspiracies of the word kind, Carried on
by the word agents, and. promoted by the
wcrft of means,âso that it may justly be
ca'led the Age of Insurrection ; unhappily,
it muff be added, they have of late experi
enced a too uniform fuCcefs. Whether our
our country is to be immolated on this san
guinary altar, depends wholly on our timelv
and vigorous exertion. An exhibition of
uncommon nerve Ckn alone preserve us from
uncommon evils; that conlpiracy, once ri
pened and matured, our ncive and our ener
gy will riret stronger our chains.
We have read of empires, afiailed and over
thrown by conspirators who sprang up like
OTufhrooms in the night ; fellows of yefter-
unknown, unthonght of.
us turn front what we read, to what we have
seen. We have ft'en the firft empire in the
world shattered to a mass of ruins, its forms
destroyed, its institutions reversed, its lan
guage overrun with barbarous and iargonic
terms, its manners debauched, its religion
destroyed, its consequence annihilated, and
its very name rendered-a loatbfome reproach;
have we not l'een these thingsâhave we not
fee-n thei,i brought about by a set of men
contemptible in their origin, character, and
at firft in number, and do we, after all this,
imagine ourfclves unassailable to the United
Irifmnen ? Think vou, the vi&ims of St.
Bartholomew's Day imagined, an hour before
their fate, the terrible stroke which awaited
them.
While, in the emphatic language of the
Roman orator, many are found exclaiming

" depotitanes of science, tlie mass has de
generated into the molt brutal ignorance,
whilst from that extremity of ctynofition in
their chat-after, whichrdiftinguilhes them in
a peculiar manner from all the reft of the
world, their Isle has contributed beyond her ,

The various affiliated Societies of United
Irishmen in this country,form one intimate,
closely connected bandâthe whole lacing
only so many ramifications of the mother
society, the fuperi. tending guidance o c
which they are dire&ed, and with which
they keep up a conflar t correspondence as
well as with each other. Thus, it is evi
dent, the gang in America is altogether
subordinate to that of Ireland: Its views, it
appears, are equally so.
The scheme. in its rude outline, is to
bring on a revolutionary state in America,
which by disorganising all 'J>e plans of com
merce ai.d trade, might diminish the
of Great Britain forcrufhing the Infurri.
on in Ireland. Th y had never;helefs mark,
cd the ramifications of a revolutionary form,
which was to have been instituted in order
the bitter to prolong those dilcrderj which
it wa3 their firft objedl to exeiie. They
coalesced with the Jacobins (moil of the
leaders of whom have aciua.ly been admitted
within the pale of the fcciety ) so far as re
garded the stalking-horse, behind the fanfti
on of whofephilofophicai fame, all this mif
chief was'to be brewed. He is the focus
whence emanate all their deep laid designs.
He is now (though a salary man) absenting
himfeif from fhat poll which he tille an d de-1
files, to forward the plans cf his nyrmidons
by writing inflammatory refoluti: ns againlt
t'.e Alien and S dition Bills, and stirring up
the people to i furrc&io.. This tall, auk
ward figure (1 do pi>i mean the noted tory
and man of laurel) imag ties, that under
the fembla-ce cf poilsfopliical retirement,
he lufficicntly cloaks those daring machina
tions* which will never thelefs drag him one
day, a trembling criminal to the bar of jus
tice. Imitating a certain foolifh bird, he
tun, his head into Helvetius, and iiaagii es
himfelf concealed, because he does not fee
-ihat he is seen.
Having used this great man 'till the'r
purposes had been fufficiently advarced, he
would have been laid on the ftutlf, or per
haps decently interred. He would have '
way to men of greater daring
stronger nerveâbetter qualified to fail on !,
the ttmpeftuous sea of liberty." Rey. !
nolds would succeed to the Dire&orfhipâ ; (
soT a Talleyrand, in body as well as mind, !,
we need not look bcyoml his melt ifflpn- ,
dent and meddlesome associate.
To further these ends, every member, on
initiation into the society, pays into the gen- {
eral fund I guinea, which contribution is
annually continued, and cncreafed by requi
sitions, as occasion calls.
A permanent committee ef correspon
dence has exilled for three ye; rs, with the
executive direftory of France, and another
with the revolter* Ireland. With both,
constant intercourfcs and communication is
~ TJo ITiear some one cry, " Nam? them J
Name them !" Lend me yourpatier.ee and
I will; Doubt not that they exiflâfor
they are identified by unquestionable evi
denceâthat of an United Injbma< ! Whoso
doubts the exigence of a direftorial body,
is a fool. Do you not fee that they poflefs
all the qualities of a body ? do they not fee ?
do they not read, do tHey not hear, do thay
not feel? or how is it that the f ars we have
excited have reprcfled their daring, and fdf- j
pended their appeal to the populace? " Con- 1
Jul â¢vidit." |
Let not the inhabitants of other towns i
suppose, that they a e free from thÂ« ma-!
chinations of United Irishmen, because Phi
ladelphia is the centre of their operations.
In Baltimore there is a ban J called the
" Republican company," ccmpofed to a man
of United Irishmen ; these, with the whole
numerous body there, voted for the Muddy
headed General, that fworti enemy to France,
that foe to her schemes, that " oppofer of
her power." Their uniform is completely
1' each, and that their principles are so, will
be doubted by no man who knows ths real
charafter of their political leader.
In short, their poison runs in every artery
of our political budy,âit is diffufed over all
the minutelt fibres of our frame. Publicity
to their machin tions, is the attempted re
medy. Here I stand in need of a&ive co
opeiation. If other people do not choose
to adopt my homely and untutored style, let
them utter the fafts I bring to lii>ht in their
owndrefs, oi any otherâat all even s give
them publicity. 1 hey should have adifTem
ination as wide as the extent of the evil. It
is answering but a partial purpose that I j
present tbem to the view of thirteen hundred, ,
people, when they should meet the eyes of j
thrice as many thousands.

ANSWER,
Of the House of Representatives,
To the Governor's Speech.
SIR,
THE didrefs, which the Citizens of
Philadelphia and its suburbs havecxperienced
during the prevalence of the late contagious
fever, has excited general lympathy.
To alleviate the injuries already fudained,
and to prevent (as far as human agency is ca
pable) the return of a malady so fatal to the
lives of our fellow-citizens, and so injurious
to the reputation of our climate and prospe
rity of the Stat?, are fubjedls which merit,
and will receive, an early consideration.
Being aware that a procradination of the
Wyoming controversy increates the difficul
ties to be overcome, and that the intered of
the State, requires, its settlement, ourutmod
exertions will be used to bring it to a fatis
fadlory conclusion.
In all our deliberations upon the other im
portant matters contained in your address, we
shall carefully keep in view " the public good"
as paramount to every other confiderationâ
and shall cheerfully concur in the adoption of
any measures which may promote an union
among our citizens, by guarding our country
againd the dedru&ive effe&s of foreign in
fluence.
The afpedl which the date of our national
affairs has a (Turned, in relation to the French
Republic, has certainly excited universal at
tention, and may, incidentally, affeft the
course of our deliberations.
Finding that the honorable overtures which
were made by the Federal Government, to
redore harmony with France, were treated
