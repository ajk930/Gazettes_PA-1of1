PHILADELPHIA,
SATURDAY EVENING, Mat 12.
MESSAGE
Of the President qf the United States,
To both Houses of Congress,
May 4th, 1798.
(Cnvcluded from yeflerdays Gazette.)
Desirous of establishing, not the depen
dence of a weak on a powerful nation, tut
that real and cordial friendfhip, the willing
and spontaneous offering of generous minds,
which can only be lasting when evidenced to
be mutual, and can only be preserved when
bottomed onreciprocal justice, theunderfign
ed, will nowreprefent withcandorand frank
nefs the well founded complaints with which
they are charged.
These complaints consist :
Of claims uncontrov.erted by the govern
ment of France, but which remain unfatis
ficd, and
Of claims founded on captures and con
fiscations, the illegality of which has not
yet been admitted.
In the firft class are arranged
Firflty. Those whose property has been |
seized under the decree of the National Con
vention of the 9th May 1793.
Secondly. Those who are entitled to eom
penfation in ionfequence of the long deten
tion of their veflels at Botirdeaux in the
years 1793 and 1794.
Thirdly. The holders of bills and other
evidences of debts due drawn by the Colo
nial Adminiftrdtions in the Weft-Indies.
Fourthly. Those whose cargoeshave been
appropriated to public ufewithout receiving '
therefor adequate payment, and
Fifthly -Those who have supplied the
government under contradts with its agents
which have not yet been complied with on
the part of France.
These well founded claims of American
citizens, thus originating in voluntary and
important supples, in the forcible seizure
ef valuable property, accompanied with
promises of payment, and in injurious de
tentions. constitute a mass of debt which
the justice and good faith of the French
government cannot refufe to provide for and
which is too considerable to beunnoticed by
thrit of the United States. The undersign
ed are inftrudted to folicit-your attention to
this fubjedt, and they would persuade them
fclves that they do not solicit in vain. So
many circumstances concur to give force to
the application, that they leave it to your
government in the confidence thajt no addi
tional reprefeAtations can b? necessary.
They pass to complaints fti'l more im
portant for their amount, more interesting
in their more serious in their con
sequences.
On the 14th Meflidor, 4th yeat of the
French Republic, one and indivisible (July
2d 1796) the Executive. Diredtory decreed
".that all neutral or allied powers (hall with
out delay be notified that the flag of the
French Republic will treat neutral veflels
either as to confifcation, as to Tearches or
capture, in the fame manner as they shall
fuffe'r the English to treat them." .This de
cree, in any point of view in which it can
be considered, could not fail to excite in the
United States the most serious attention.â
It dispenses at once as they conceive with
the most solemn obligations which compadt
can create, and consequently asserts a right
on the part of France, to recede at her dis
cretion from any stipulations she mayhaveen
tered into. It has been demonstrated that
governments may by contradt change,as bet
ween themselves, the ruleseftablifhed by the
law of nations, and that such contradt be
comes completely oiM gatory on the parties,
though it can in no manneraffedt the rights
of others,yet bythisdecree allies with whom
such stipulations exist are to be treated,
without regard to such stipulations, in the
fame manner as they are treated by others,
who are bound by a different rule. This as
it refpedts the United States is the more un
friendly, because a readiness has been mani
fefted on their part so to modify by con
sent their treaty with France as to reinstate
the rules established by the Law of Nations.
The general terms too in which this de
cree is conceived, threatenedbut too certain
ly the mifchiefs it has generated, and the
abuses which have been pradtifed under it.
Neutrals are to be treated a 9 they shall per
mit the English to treat them. No rule ex
tradted from the pradtiee of England is laid
down, which might govern the cruisers of
France, or inftrutt the veflels of neutrals.
No principles are stated manifefting the opi
nion entertained of the treatment received
from England, which might enable a neutral
to controvert that opinion, and to shew that
the English were not permitted to treat its
flag as was fnppofed by the government of
France. To judge from the decree itfelf,
from any information given concerning it,
or from the pradtiee under it, those who
were to be benefitted by its abuse, were to
decide in what manner it should be executed
and the cniifer who (hould fall in with a
valuable vessel had only to conTult his own
rapacity, in order to determine whether an
English privateer, meeting a vessel under si
milar circumftaiu;#?, would capture and
bring hei into port. Multiplied exccffes and
accumulated vexations could not but have
been apprehended from such a decree, & the
fadt has realized every fear that was entain
tained concerning it. It has been con ftru
ed even in Europe to authorize the capture
and condemnation of American vessels for
the single circumflanci of their being deT
tined for a British port. At 110 period of
the war has Britain undertaken to exercise
such a pewer. At no period of the war has
(he affertcd such a right. It is a power
which prostrates every principle of national
f vereignty and to which no nation can sub
mit without relioquifhing at the fame time f
its bed interefU and facriflcing its cleared
rights. This power has been exereifed by
_ France on therich and unprotected commerce
of an ally, on the presumption that that
al'y was sustaining the fame injuries from
Britain, at a fime whert it is believed that
the depredations of that nation had ceased,
and the principle of compensating for them
j had been recognized.
, 1 In the Weft-Indies similar depredations
â  have been experienced On the Ift of Au
; gust 1796, the special agents of the Ex
ecutive Directory to the Windward Islands
decreed, that all veflels loaded with contra
band goods should be seized and c*nfifcated
' for the benefit of the captors.
: On the feventb Frimaire, sth year of the
I French Republic, one and indivisible. (27th
> November, 17961 the commission delegated
1 by the French Republic to the Leward Ifl
-1 ands, revived that the captains of the French
national veflels and.privateen are authorised
to flop and bring into the ports of the colo
ny American vefTels bound to English ports
or coming from the said ports.
On the 19th Pltfviofe, sth year of the
French Republic, one and indivisible, (Fe
bruary ift, 1797) Vidtor Hugues and Le
bas, the special agents of the Executive di
reftory to the Windward islands, passed a
decree, fubjedting to capture and confifca
tion neutral vefTels destined for the Wind
ward and Leeward Islands of America, de
' livered up to the English, and occupied and
defended by the emigrants. These ports
are said to be Martinico, St. Lucie, Toba
go, Demerara, Berbice, Effequibo, Port
au-Prince, St. Marks, L'Archaye, and
Jeremie. The decree alio fubje&s to cap
ture all vefTels which have cleared out for
the Weft-Indies generally.
The undersigned will not detain you ci
tizenminifter.forthejpurpofeof proving how
diredtly and openly these decrees violateboth
the law of nations and the treaty between
France and the United States.
They have been executed on the officers
and crews of the captured vefTels in a man
ner, by no means calculated to mitigate
their rigor. '
The decree of the fourteenth of Meflidor
was soon followed by another which hasfpar
ed but little of the American commerce, ex
cept what has fortunately efeapedthe pursuit
of the cruizers of France. On the twelfth
Ventofe, sth year, (2d March, 1797) the
Executive Directory considering the treaty
of amity, commerce, and navigation con
cluded at London the 19th November, 1794
between thefaid United States and England,
as containing concessions of privileges to
Britain which, under the treaty of Februa
ry 1778, might be enjoyed by this republic
alio, proceeds to modify the treaty between
France and the United States, by declaring
enemies goods in American bottoms liable
to capture and confifcation ; by enlargiug
the lift of contraband and by fubje&ing to
I punishment as a pirate any American citi
zen holding a cotrtmiffion given by the ene
mies of France, as well as every Teaman of
that nation, making a part of the crew of
enemies ships. The decree next proceeds
ta exa,d* fr*"r Americans,
been made necessary to establish the neutral
ity of foreign vefTels, generally, by the or
dimnce of the 26th of July, 1778, but
which had never been considered as applying
to the United [States] ; which required
papers their vefTels could not be supposed to
possess, and which the treaty between the
two nations was fnppofed to have rendered
tinneceiTary.
The basis taken by the Executive Direc
tory, on which to reft their modification of
the treaty of the sixth of February, 1778,
is that by the treaty of the nineteenth of
November, 1794 i particulnr favours in ref
pe3 of commerce and navigation have been gran
ted to England.
It has been demonstrated that no particu
lar favors in refpedt of commerce or naviga
tion, have heen granted to England. That
treaty has been shewn only to recognize, re
gulate, and moderate the exercise of the
rights before pofleffed, and before openly
acknowledged to be pofleffedârights which
France and America had reciprocally ceded
to each other, without requiring, a 9 a con
dition of the ceflion, that either should com
pel England to form a similar ftipulatien.
But to admit for a moment that the trea
ty with England might be considered as stip
ulating favours not before pofleffed, yet the
American government did not so understand
that treaty, and had manifefted a disposi
tion to modify, by common consent, its re
lations with this republic, iri such manner
as to rein-state a rule, which has been vol
untarily changed. It cannot but be sincere
ly regretted, it seemed to indicate
an unfriendly temper, that France has deem
ed it more eligible to establish by force, in
opposition to her treaty, a principle which
she deemed convenient, than to fix that
principle on the Jfair basis of mutual and a
micable agreement.
But the clause under which these modi
fications are juftified is in these worfls .â¢
" The most Chriflian King and the United
States engage mutually not to grant any
any particular favor to other nations, ia ref
pedt to commerce and navigation which shall
not immediately become common to the
other party, who shall enjoy the fame favor
freely, if the conceflion was freely made, or
on allowing the fame eompenfation if the v
conceflion was conditional." If these ftipu-'
lations unequivocally amounted to the grant
of favors, still the grant is not gratuiteus.
The concefliogs on the part of the United
States are made on condition of similar con
ceflions on the part of Britain. If there
fore France chufes to consider them as mo- -
difications of the Treaty of 1778, she can '
only do it by granting the reciprocal condi- ,
lion ; on this supposition she has either of
the rules at her eledtion, but she cannot vary
from the firft without a compadt on her part i
to grant the reciprocal stipulation. Such a 1
compadt is in the nature of a national treaty. '
But the rules laid dowrt in the decree of '
1 2th Ventofe, sth year (March 2, 1797) as '
founded on the 17th, 18th and 21ft articles <
t of the treaty of the 19th of November '94
r are materially variant from those articles.
. To demonftrate,this it is c*nly necessary to
t contrail the rules of the decree with the ar
-1 tides of the treaty on which those rules are
t said to be founded.

Actording to the article, when Â»n jufl suspi

of carrying to the enemy contraband of war, a
ve(Tel (hall be brought into port, that part only
which belongs to the enemy (hall be made prize,
according to the article, then the fa# whether

capture or detention was founded. The bur
then of the proof relts on him. If in truth
and in fad the property does not belong to an
enemy or is not proved to belong to an enemy,
it must be discharged. But the rule pursues a
different course. Tke rule declares that mer
chandize of the enemy or not fufficiently proved
to be neutral, laden under the American flag,
(hall be confifcated. The burthen of the proof
is Ihifted from the captor to the captured. The
qtleftion to be tried is not solely whether the
merchandize be in fad the property of an ene
my, but also whether it be fufficiently proved to
be neutral. The fuflciency of this proof is to
be ascertained, not b; general and fatisfidory
testimony, not by the great principles of trath
and the common uidfrftanding of mankind,
but by the Â«xhibitionaf certain papers demand
able at the will of oie of the parties, amj not

regulation which Fraice chooses to eflablifh ;
but certainly it is a regulation, essentially variant
from the article it pro'effes to referable.

rate. a
The government f the United State* has ne- Â£
ver formed any treat compreliending an article
in any degree fimila to this lule. It has never 1
assented to fueh flip lai ions as they relate to its
own citizens, or reaired them ?s they relate to C
those of other powei. The difference between V
the article and the rte requires uo comment.â
Nor will the rule bicornmented on. The un-
derfigned will onlyobfierv, that the article is f
j. by n > means uncommon, but is to be found in
1. mo* treaties of amity and commerce. The aift
0 article of the treaty wiih France, the 19th of
the treaty with the United Provinces, the 23d of
the treaty with Sweden', and the zcth article of
the treaiy with Priiflia, contain similar ftipula
tion-. It is not easy to conceive a reason why it
e (hould not also be infÂ«rted in a treaty with En
- gland, or why its insertion (hould give offence
to France.
But :he fourth rule of the decree is in its ope
ration the most extenlive 3nd the most seriously
deftruifttvc. That rule declares, that" confor
" mably to the law of the 14th February, 1793,
e the regulations of the lift of Odobcr, 1744,
f and of the 26th of July, 1778, coneerning the
- manner of proving the property of neutral (hips
" and merchandize, (hall be executed according
to their form and tenor.
" Every American (hip lhall therefore be a
e good prize, which (hall not have en board a lift
r of the orew in proper form, fach as is prefcrib
-1 ed by the model annexed to the trea'y of the 6th
: of February, 1778, the observance of which is
1 required by the ajth and 37th articles of the
' fame treaty.
I This rule requires that American (hips and mer
chandize, in order to prove the property to be A
- merican, (hall exhibit certain papers, and efperfal
: ly a role d'equipage, which are required of neutrals
; generally hy the particular marine ordinances of
- France, recited in tke decrees of the Djredory.
f But France and America havecutered into a solemn
treaty, one objed of which was to secure the vef
. fels of either party, which might be at peace, from
| the ernifers of the other which might bÂ» engaged
in war. To effed this objed the contrasting par
ties have not referred each other to the particular
(latutes or ordinaaces of either government, but
have enumerated the papers which (hould bedeem
ed fufficient. They have done more : They have
prescribed the very form of the passport which
(hould establish the neutrality of the vessel, and
prevent her being diverted .from her course. The
25th and 27th articles of the treaty between the
two nations, which are quoted by the Diredory,
and are cÂ«nfidered by the undersigned ascondufivc
on this fubjed, are in these words:
ARTICLE 25.
" To the end that all manner of diffen
tions and quarrels may be avoided and pre
vented on the one fide and on the other, it
is agreed that in cafe either of the parties
hereto (hould be engaged in war, the (hips
and vessels belonging to the fubjefts or peo
ple of the other ally must be furnilhed with
sea-letters or pafports. exprefling the name,
..propel ty and bulk of the ftiip, as also the
name and place of habitation of the mailer
or commander of the said ship, that it may
appear thereby '.hat the said (hip really and
truly belongs to the fubjefts of one of the
parties, which pafiport shall be made out
and granted according to the form annex
ed to this treaty, and they lhall likewise be
recalled every year, that is, if the ship hap
pens to rtturn home in the space of a year.
It is likewise agreed that such fhipa, beiHg
laden, are to be provided not only with pair
ports, as above mentioned, but also with
certificates containing the several particu
lars of the cargo, the place whence the ship
failed, and whither Ihe is bound, that so it
may be known whether any forbidden or
contraband goods be on board the fame ;
which certificates lhall be made out by the
officers of the place, whence the ship set
fail, in the accustomed form ; and if any
one lhall think it fit or advifeable_to
in the said the person to whom
ââ¦â re};u-ans on board bclUDjr, lie iiiay freely
do so."
ARTICLE 27.
" If the (hips of the said fubje&s, peo
ple er inhabitants of either of the parties,
lhall be met with either failing along the
coasts, or on the high seas, by any (hip of
war of the other, or by any privateers, the
laid (hips of war or privateers, for the a
voiding of any disorder, (hall remain out of
cannon (hot, and may fend their boats a
board the merchant (hip, which they (hall
so meet with, and may enter her to the
number of two or three men only, to whom
the matter or commandti of such ship or
vessel (hall exhibit his paflport, concerning
the property of the (hip, made out accord
ing to the form inserted in this present trea
ty , and the ship. when (he (hall have (hew
ed such paflport, (hall be free and at liberty
to pursue h<;r voyage, so as it (hall not be
lawful to molest or feareh her in any man
ner, or to give her Â«hafs or force her to
quit her intended course."
It will be admitted, that the two nations
pofiefs the power of agreeing that any pa- ]
per in any form (hall be the sole document, '
demandable by either from the other, to
prove the property of a veflel and cargo. â 
It will also be admitted, that an agreement j
so made becomes the law of the parties, 1
which must retain its obligation. j
Examine then the words of the compadt i
and determine by fair cotiftruftion what (
will fatisfy them. ,
The 25th article dates substantially the ]
contents of a paper, which is termed a sea- (
letter or paflport, and which "it is agreed
that in cafe either of the parties (hould be c
engaged in war, the Ihips and vsffels be- j
longing to the fubjefts or people of the o- 1
ther ally must be furniflied with." To c
what purpose are they to be furtiifhed with <
this sea-letter or paflport ? The article an- ]
fwers, " To the end that all manner of dif- v
fentions and quarrels may be avoided and 1
prevented, on one fide and the other, " that r
it Tnay appear thereby that the (hip really
and truly belongs to the fubjeds of one of c
the parties." '
But how will the paflport Â«< prevent and t
avoid all manner of diflentions and quarrels c
on one fide or the other," if ordinances, t
both prior, and subsequent to the treaty,
are to be understood as controling it, and as i
requiring other papers not contemplated io t
he public agreement of the two nations ? f
How is it to appear from the paflport, t
that the (hip really and truly belongs to 1
the fubjefts of one of the parties," if it is r
denied that the paflport is evidence of that f
fa ft, and contended that other papers, not ]
alluded to in the treaty, (hall be adduced to r
prove it ?
But the 27th article is still more explicit, c
It declares that when a merchant-lhtp of one (
of the parties lhall be Wfited by the Ihips of t
war or privateers of the other, Â«'the com- 1
mander of such (hip or vgflel (hall exhibit
nis paflport, conoerning the property of the t
>hip, made out according to the form infer- ]
i ted in the present treaty, aÂ»l the ft;*
1 when (he shall have /hewed such passport,
? shall be free and at liberty to pursue her voy
p age, so as it (hall not be lawful to molest or
search her in any manner, or to give chafe,
t or force her to quit her intended course."
â  What is it that shall prove the property of
: the vÂ«ffel? The treaty answers, the pass
port. But'the decree of the direÂ£k>fy re
' quires in addition certain other papers, per
fe&ly diftinft from the passport. The trea
ty declares, that'? the ship whea (he shall
, have (hewed (not the role d'equipage or a
ny other paper, required by the particular
* ordinance! of either nation, but) "such
passport, (hall be free and at liberty to pilr
fue her voyage, so as it shall not be lawful
I to molest or search her in any manner, or to
give her chafe or force her to quit her inten
ded course." Yet the vessels of America,
i after exhibiting " such passport" are not
" free arid at liberty to pursue their voyÂ«
age they are " molested ;" they are
" chafed," they are " forced to quit their
intended course ;" they are captured and
i confifcated as hostile property.
It is alledged that the form of the pass
port, which is annexed to the treaty, man
ifefts that certain ads were to be performed
by the person to whom the passport is deliv
ered, and that fach person ought to prove
the performance of those ads.
But the treaty, far from requiring such
proof, absolutely dispenses with it. The
treaty declares that the passport shall itfelf
evidence the property of the vessel and se
cure it from molestation of any fort. By
coufent of the parties then the passport is
evidence of all that either party can require
from the other. Neither the right to give
such consent, or the obligation of a com
pad formed upon it can, as is conceived,
ever be denied, nor can the form of the
passport, whatever it jnaj" he. change the
compad.
But let the words of th.e model be exam
ined. They are " AJtous ceux qui ces pre
fentes verront : foit taotoire que faculte et
permiflion a ete accordee a maitre
ou commandant du navire appelle
de la ville de de la capacite de
tonneaux ou environ, fe trouvant
prefentement dans le port de
qu' apres que son navire a ete vifite et avant
son depart, il pretera ferment entre let
mains des officiers de la marine, qui le dit
navire appartient a un ou plufieurs fujets de
dont l'ade sera mis a la fin des
prefentes ; de meme qu'il gardera.les or
donnances et regleraens maritimes, et re
mettra une lifte fignee et confirmee par tÂ«.
moins, contenant les noms et furnoms, les
lieux de naiffance, et la demeure des per
fonnes compofant l'equipage dÂ» son navire,
et de tous ceux qui embarqueront, lefqoels
ilne recevra pas a bord fans eonnoiffance et
permiflion des officiers de marine ; et dans
| ch'aque port ou havre, il montrera la prefente
permiflion aux officiers et judges de marine."
It is material to observe, that the model
requires the oath coneemÂ«"g the property
Oi me veltel to be annexed to the paffportj
but does not nwy certified,
or the annexation of any paper whatever.
Why this difference ? It is a solemn proof
of that for which the article stipulates and
therefore the model expresses that the evi
dence of this faA shall be annexed, but it
does not require the produdion of the evi
dence of any other "fad.
It seems then tc be demonstrated that â 
the sea lettei or passport, a model of which
is annexed to the treaty, is by solemn agree
ment to be received by each party as eon
clufive tcftimony, that the vessel producing
such passport is the property of a citizen of
the other, and is consequently to continue
her voyage without molestation or hin
drance.
But let it be supposed that the treaty on
this fubjed was less conclusive, and that its
ftipulationshad beed ambiguously expressed;
yet it is certain that it has been uniformly
understood by both parties, as th& urider
figned have expounded it, and that neither
France nor the United States, previous to
the complained of, confidcred the
vessels of either nation, producing the pass
port agreed on, as liable to capture for want
of a role d' equipage.
1 or more than four years after her treaty
with the United States, France was enga
ged in a war with Britain, and in the course
of that time it was never suggested that a
role d'equipage wasneceffary for theproted
ion of an Ameriean vessel. Itdoes not weak,
en the argument that the United States
were also parties to the war. The princi
ple assumed is, that without the produdion
of the papers required by the decree, the
vessel docs not appear to be, and cannot be
considered as American property. If this
principle be corred, it would not cease to
apply because the United States were enga
ged in the war. Was America even enga
ged in the war on the part of France, a
British vessel car ying American colours
would not be secured by the flag she bore.
It would be necessary to prove by her pa
pers, or other admiflible testimony that the
vessel was American property. If this fad
cannot appear without a role d'equipage
while the United, States are at peace, nei
ther could it appear without the fame evi
dence if the United States were parties to
the war.
About four years of the present war had
also elapsed before this conflrudion of the
treaty, at the fame time so wonderful and
so ruinous, had disclosed itfelf. In the course
of that time the ports of France were filled
with the vessels of the United States. Very
many of them failed under contrads made
for the government itfelf by its minister in
Philadelphia. No. one of them possessed a
role d'equipage ; no one of them was consi
dered on that.accoSnt as being liable to con
demnation. Indeed, in fame instances, ves
sels have been captured and discharged al
though this paper was not among those be
longing to the (hip.
Such a long course of pradice appears
to have evidenced unequivocally the sense
France on ih's fubjed.It is too apparent to be quetlioued for a
moment, that on the part of the United
States no suspicion had ever been entertain
ed that such a paper eould have been re
quired. A role d'equipage could have been
obtained with as much facility as that pafT
port foi which the treaty stipulates Could
it have been imagined that American veflels
'incurred the possible hazard of being retar
ded only one day in a voyage for want of
such paper, it would in every instance have
been supplied. No vessels would have fail
ed without it.
Your own mind. Citizen Minister, will
fugged to you, with irresistible force, the
extieiue hardship ofthus puttings new con
flruction on along existing contrail, or of
giving a new and unexpected ex'enfion to
ancie t municipal regulations, and of con
demning thereby veflels taken on the high
seas for want of a paper not known to be
required, when they failed out of port. If
a role d'equipage was really considered by
France as necessary evidence of any fart, the
establishment of which was deemed eflVntial,
common ufatje and those plain principles of
jufticc which all nations refpeft, in
â difpentibly requite that the regulation thonld
firft be made known to a neutral and friend-
Jy nationby other means than by the capture
Â»nd confiscation of its pronerty. If this
nieafure had been announced to the govern
ment of the United States, before ii had
been put in praitfce, and American veflels
had failed without a role d'equipage. they
would have taken upon themselves the ha
zard of such a procedure. But in a mo
mem when the ocean is covered with peace
ful merchantmen, purftiing a just and law
ful commerce, tobring intofudden operation
a nieafure which had never before been ap
plied to them, which had for so many years
flepf unheard of, a"d by the force of this
nituMwii to-eofffifcate unsftiardsd proper
ty which had been trusted to the seas, undet
the faith offolemn andexifting treaties, and
without conjecture that this, more than any
other formaly, would have been required,
ft to impose on unoffending individuals a
ruin from which no wife precaution*, no hu
man forcftght could possibly have I'roteited
them.
On this fuhjeft then the undersigned ap
peal with confidence to the juilice and e
quity of the French government.
But cmld it bt conceded for a moment
that the Executive Directory might right
fully modify the treaty of France witS the j
United States by that of the United States
with Britain, and might rightfully require
a role d'equipage in order to eltablifh the
neutrality of a vefTel, for want of which the
vessel might be confifcated, yet, the cargo
being proved to be Beutral ought to be fafe.
According to the law of Nations, the
goods of an~enemy found on board the ship
of a friend arÂ« liable to capture, and the
goods of a friend found on board the ship of
an enemy are fafe. The United States and
France hive contented to change this rule
as between themfel*<Â»a. They have agreed
that the goods of an enemy faucet
the vctfeh of either party thall be fafe, and
rhat the goods of either found on board the
vessel of an enemy thall be liable to capture.
Tlie one part of the rule is in consequence
of and dependent on the other. The one
part cannot on any principle of jnftice be a
bandoned while the other is maintained.
In their treaty with England the United
States retain unchanged the principle of the
law of nations. If.France modifies her trea
ty in this rctpeet by that of England, she
ought to'ake the principle intire. If in
' cons rmity to the treat* between the Uni
ted States and England, France claims the
right of taking enemies property found on
board an American thip, then, in conform
ity with that treaty al.l'o, France ought to
spare American property, found on board
an enemy's (hip. If, therefore, this extra
ordinary petition could be maintained, that
an American ship without a role d'equipage
becomes the thip of an enemy, still the car
go, bei- g proved to be the property ot a
friend, ought, on the principle of modify
ing the treaty between the two nations by,
that with England, to have been fellored
to the owners.
The result of these regulations baa been
the most ex ten live and universal devastation
of the American commerce. Not only ves
sels bound to and from the enemies of France
but vessels bound to and from her allies, and
to and from her own ports have been fdzed
and confifcated.
The inevit able consequence has been, that
dired* commerce between the two nations is
almoil annihilated, and that the property of
American citizens has bren taken to a much
larger amount than would have betn possible
in a ftste of adtual war.
Yet the government of the United States,
wishing, if it b* possible, to avoid even de
fenfive measures, has fought assiduously and
unremittingly, though hitherto without
success, for such peaceful and amicable ex
planations as might do away exitling animo
sities, and restore between the two repub
lics that harmony which it so truly delires.
America has accustomed herfelf to per
ceive in France or.lv the ally and the friend
Consulting the feelings of her own bosom,
she has believed that between republics an
elevated and refined friendfhip could exist,
and that free nations were capable of main
taining for each other a real and permanent
affedtios. If this pleating theory, erected
wit'ifo much care and viewed with so much -
delight, has been impaired by experience,
yet the hope continues to be cherished that
this circwtnftance does not necessarily involve
the nppofite extreme. It is believed that
there exists no fufficient cause for solid and
permanent enmity between France and the
United States, but that on the contrary the
interetls of both would be promoted by that!
friendly intereourfe, which a reciprocal ob
servance of the great and immutable
principles of jnftice would certaiply etla-'
blifh and can alone preferÂ»e. Under this
imprefljon America resists the opinion that
the present ttate of things lias grown out '
of a digested system to which France de-
signs to adhere. She wlfliej and she endea
vors to persuade herfelf that temporary
causes, which too often produce effects a
found and just policy mult reprobate, con
nedted with a mifconilrudtion of the con
dudt of her government, as well as of the
motives on which it h.s adted, may have
occasioned those very serious aggreffior.s of
which (he complains. She recedes there
fore, even under the prcfTure of these ag
' greffions, (lowly and with difficulty from
the attachments the has formed. So inter
twined with every ligament of her heart
I have been the chords of affedtion which
bound her to France, that only repeated
and continual ads of hostility can tea- them
afundcr.
i The government of the United States,
therefore, still searches the means of ter
minating peacefully, and in a manner which
ought to be mutually fatisfadtory, the ca
lamities of ihe moment, and or averting
: the still greater calami ies which may be re
fervedfor ihe future. N.-t even the dis
couraging and urtufual events which had
prÂ«crded the prefsnt efTort to negociate
â  could deter that government from repeating
I its endeavors for the preservation of amity
and peace. âThree citizens ot the United
States have been deputed as envoys extraor
i dinary and ministers plenipotentiary to the
French republic. Their inftrudtions au-
I thorize and diredt them to review the exift
i ing treaties between the two nation, and to
remove by all proper means, tha inequalities
which have .grown out Â«f the stipulations
of those treaties, in confeqnence of the re
fufal of England to adopt the principles they
contain. They are also directed to give fair
and complete explanations of the conduit
of the government they represent ; to state
fully and truly the heavy injuries which
their fellow eititens have plained ; and to
Â«ik from the equity of a great and magnan
imous republic that compensation for those
injuries which we flatter ourselves, their
juttiec will Rot refufe and their liberal policy
will not hesitate to give.
Bringing with them the temper of their
government and country, fearchitjg only for
the means of effecting the objedts of their
million, they have permitted no personal
considerations to influence their conduit,
but have waited under cireumftances beyond
measure embarrafling and unpleasant, with
that refpedt which the American govern
ment has so uniformly paid to that of France
! for permiflion to l#y before you, citizen
minister, these important communications
with which they have been charged.
Perceiving 110 probability of being allowed to
enter, in the wt\ial forms, on those dil'cuflisni
which might tend to restore harmony between,
the two republics, they havÂ« deemed it most ad
vileable, even under the circumstances of infor
mality which attend the measure, to addrefsto
your government, through you, this cindid re
view of the conduct, and.this true representa
tion of the sentiments and wifliei of the govern
ment of the United States. They pray that it
may be received in the temper with which it is
written, and considered as an additional effort,
f rawing out of a dii'uoliii . to the
ovcrtuneiit people of America", so Â«um
vate and restore, if it be poflibte, harmony be
tween the two republics. If, citizen minister,
there remains a hope that these desirable objedti
can be effeftesl by an? means which the United
States have authorized, the undersigned will still
lolicit and will still rcfpe&fully attend the deve
lopement of those means.
if on the contrary na fiich hope remains ;
they have only to prav that their return to their
'own country may be facilitated j and they will
leave France with the most deep-felt regret that
neither the real and fiocere f'ne ndfhip, whith
[he government of the United States has sb uni
formly and unequivocally Uifplayed for this
great republic, nor its continued efforts to de
monstrate the purity of its condudt and inten
tions, can proteit its citizens, or preferv* them
from the calamities which they h Jve fought by i
jult and upright contuft td avert.
The underlined pray you, citizen
to accept the affiirances of their perfect refpeit
and conlideration.

1 When the arrest of the persons now in custody
, was reported on Monday last, a conftdt-rable ap
pearand of alarm aud agitation was difterniblc
throughout the city ; many pcrlons notorious for
seditious prailices were seen JcolleAiug in various
parts, in such numbers as to promise some immedi
ate and violent effort. The firft ctfay of theiv
strength was made by insulting those who Â« ere ohÂ»
noxious from nnk or loyalty. In Parliament ftrect
an attempt of this kind was made upon the lord
chancellor as he paired on the way to his court, but
by his own decifivafpiiit,, and the prompt fuppÂ»rt
of several loyal gentlemen, who immediately as
sembled round him, the malice of treason was
frullrated. It was then seen that but one resource
of fafety remained to the well affeAed, and that
resource was inflantly adoptedâthe yeomanry
flew to arms. In the short space of an hour not
lefsthan two hundred of the lawyers corps appear
ed on their parade; the sttorni.s were nÂ»t lefa
prompt or numerous; B*reÂ»ford's cavalry wÂ«re
equally forward; the divisional corps, the callage
regiment, the St. Sepulchre's, the liberty rangers,
uppefcrofs, &c. &c. all were arrayed with a dis
patch which it is hardly poflible to conceive ; 4
I clifpatch the mere admirable, as the effort was pure
ly voluntary, founded no: apon orders or upon
summons, but flpringing from the imperiousand
obvious danger, which lta-ed in tht face of every
man who felt the sensation of loyalty, and percei
ved the unusual agitation of the difaffe&ed.
It is glorious for the city of Dublin to record,
that upon such a 1 trying eccafton, and in so brief a
space of time, a- voluntary, unfummontd attend
ance of fifteen hundred of the citizens wera to be
seen ia arms. rent* A ft t-in t.~.
1 111- : -.it iÂ» glorious uot only from the foul in
spiring confidence which the circumtlance has giv
en to loyalty, but as a full, firm and hou.rable re
futation of thÂ« abominable flinders propagated in
the seditious papers against our loyal aud gallant
yeomanry.
Nor fttould we forget upon this ocrafion the ar
dent and honest loyalty of th* soldiers of the gar
rifen. Parties 0/ the sth dragoons Were dispersed
throughout the streets of thÂ« city in such a way,
as to reflrain the lead effort at disturbance , the :
the Armagh, Cavan, King's County , North Cork, (
Dunbarton, and other regiments, were under arms J
and appeared only anxious for a fair opportunity of
evincing their courage and loyalty, againll any
who should dare to carry their seditious attempts
ir.toas)sof treasonable iufurrtCiion.
While the Yeomany were waiting on their
parades for neeeflary orders, it was pleaiing
to obftrvi: that fevtral country gentlemen
were every moment failling into the ranks in
their refpeftive uniforms ; and it was truly
delightful to contemplate the chearful and 1
animated countenances of our brave Protest- ,
ors, arrayed in the common ca life of Truth
and Honour against Sedition and Rebellion.
Nor did Sedition dart? to raise her head
! againll such an host. The disappointed Agi
; tators sneaked into their lurking places, and
bid their d minified heads, curling the ill
fortune which had fallen upon their ma'tig- '
nant projefts ofconfufion and infurre&ion. |
The Yeomanry were however directed to I
take upon therafelves the protedlion of the i
. city for that and ihe ensuing night, a fcr
vice which they undertook and performed
wtth the fame alacnty and f*ccefs to which
the City of Dublin owed its fafety and tran- ;
quility in the course of last May and June. !
Parties of horse and foot were according- j
ly established throughout the different quar- j
tens of the city on Monday and Ttiefday j
evening ; so that the fame streets in which
it was last week a fervicc of danger to walK
even at noon day, were rendered so tran

MR. FENNO,
Be pleased to publish the following
letter from Rome, dated 27th Dec. '97.
"On the 7,Bth December, at 3 o'clock,
j in the afternoon, a mob of discontented
people began to revolt against this gov
ernment, which took place before the
palace of the French ambaflador ; they
tried to disarm the troops of the lines in
their quarters, but they were repulsed
with loss ; mean time a French general,
by jpame M. Dieufaux, (or Duphot) the
FrenchambalTador, andlive other French
men, went down from dinner with their
naked sabres, took off their hats, and
put them on the points, crying, liberty
and equality ; at this emotion the troops
fired on the mob, and the general recei
ved a wound ; he finding himfelf so
wounded, began to make the best of his
sabre against the cavalry, which came to
help the infantry ; they fired on the said
general, and he was killed on the spot ; i
* in this adh'on 15 Romans wet â¢ kiflvdÂ»

ambnffidor, at 5 o'clock the following
