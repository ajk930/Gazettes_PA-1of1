Tuesday, May 15- . ce
(Continued from yfflsrday's Gazetie.) . j
Mr. Sew a li, said, it was a very difHcult jj
thing to rcltrict the right of petitioning; but cj
it was very evident that some reftricrion ought yy
to be put upon it, if poftible. He believed
there might be petitions so offenfive in their j c
manner and matter, as not to be fnflered to
have a public reading ; there might be others, w
which on being read, should be found unfit to
bereferred. Of the latter kind he thought f Q
the prefenr. Certain persons, it seems, have ar
affbeiated for the purpose of military exercise, oj
and have thought proper to exprels their-very
extraordinary.fentinients to Congrela. Whe
ther these fentmien>s were founded or tin- , r(
founded, he would not enquire, but only
whether they were decently expressed. He r
admitted the right which these people had to Â£
exercise their opinions upon all government
measures, and that they might therefore fay
whether they thought the agents w.ho con
versed with our commiflioners were authoriz-
ed, or not. But do these proceedings go no n
farther ? Have they ihe right 10 fay that go- t]
vernment have neglected their duty ; to fay
that they have wilfully and designedly b 1 id
ed the people contrary to the interests of the
coiVimunity, by falfeiy and wantonly pervert- i(J
ing the difpatchesof our envoys for the pur-
of producing a war with the French re- t
public. , And are these suggestions not only t
to Ipe heard, but acted upon, as if they were v
proper*fubjects for their confidcration and fu-
ture debate. The very suggestion ought, in t
1 tis opinion, to have excited an indignation t
which would immediately have rejected lttch t
a paper. He was astonished to hear the gen- t
tleman from Pennsylvania, tho' he aeknow- v
Jged the impropriety of the thing, go into (
arguments in favour of referring it ; that he t
should lay weought to convince them of their t
error. He (Mr. S.) believed it they them- (
selves could not fee it, it would scarcely be
proper for the house to enter into an argu- j
ment with them on the iubject. If the charg- ,
es in this paper are founded, they lie againfl (
this house, as much as any other branch of the
government, for concurring in the publicati- J
on of the late dispatches; therefore, this
house have held out falfe colours, according
to these people , as well as the other branches
of the government. He would, at once reject
such an address ; he would fay to be fubferi
bers, " take back your suggestionsâthey are
altogether groundless."
Mr. Otis said, if he could consider the pa
per before the House as barely expreflive of
approbation or disapprobation of public mea
sures, he should be in favour of referring it as
.is usual, though contrary to his opinion, he
certainly would not objeft to it on that ac
count. But it appears to hint not only ex
preflive of an opinion, but a direÂ£l cenfare
and calumny on the whole government, and
upon our Commissioners at Paris. Who is
the person high in office that they charge with
giving a falfe colour to the late dilpatches ?
Did they allude to the Prelident. He did not
recoiled* any sentiment of hisrefpecting them.
| After being asked for the papers, he sent them.
If there was any blame imputable for the
publication of them, it lay aÂ£ainft the other
branches of the government more than against
, him. But there were other fentinients fhll
i more illiberal. He wished to know who held
i up these dispatches as ads of the French
1 vernment ? Was it not those men who have
- 1 left their families and home, and exposed
1 themselves to the hazards of an arduous and
~ dangerous million ; who may perhaps' at this
J moment be imprifoncd for making them
known, or who may even be put to death for
their conduct in this refpett. And was it
right for the government who ernployedthem
e td receive charges againlt their Commilfion
- ers ? Was this the reward they vi fcre entitled
I to? He thought not.
Â» The gentleman from Pennfvjva.iia fays,
" that to refer this petition will not be to give,
any approbation to its contents ; but he (Mr.
O v ) wished the Houle to (hew its difappmba
tion of it. Afi address like this wouid give
c the French an apology for denying that they
knew any thing of the communications held
, with our Minilters, and which they would be
o afraid to do, if the thing was not aflerted on
' this fide of the water, it was in this view,
n principally, that he objected to the receiving
II of this address.
Mr. O. said he did not mean to follow the
arguments of the gentlemen from Pennsylva
nia and Virginia, who fay it is not customary
to refufe a reference to petitions. Thpugh
c this had not hitherto been the cafe, at no o
d ther tiwe had we been so critically circum
n ftanced ; at no time could a factious and fe
>f ditious spirit have been so inimical to the hap
-- pinefs ot"the country as at present. But gen
a tlemen are not willing to disgrace ihefe met)
by rehtfirtg their address a reference. There
e was no occasion for this. He saw with grief
s that the solvent of sedition had taken poflef
l_ fion of the hearts of these addreflers, and alie
nated tneir affections from their government.
c But though these are the fentinients of am i
-0 litia company, they are not the fentimentsof
Â» the militia of the United States. If the mi-
litia of the southern country poirefled fenti
e ments of this kind, it would be a stronger ar
gument than any other for the eftablilhment
of a regular force to protect it.
Mr. Harper believed the fentimentscon
tained in this address to be very erroneous,
e and very improperly expreHed ; nor did he
-e think, out of respeCt for the addreflers, whe-:
n ther they were a company of grenadiers, or
y forty members ot the Legislature of Pennlyl
vania, when they undertake to leÂ«Sture the go
d vernment on account of measures which have
, r been adopted, and to tell the world that they
will produce nothing but calamity, their ad
r. dress oughf to be referred on that account,
d yet he was in favour of referring the present
proceedings ; and the reason was, he saw that
f e if this.courte was taken it would lead to end
t> less broils in the House. He conceived that
:e in the present important crisis, the people
will prefenttheir sentiments to Congress, arifl
those sentiments will be various, and some of
them improperly exprelfed. in the cafe of
the Britilh treaty, a multitude of address
were received; a â¢ I if, whenever an address
could be objected toon account of its being
couched in t-Sns, or becauie
, t the sentiments are Objectionable, there would
.J be no end ofdifcuflions of this kind, 'and the
' , public tin fine's would !>r g'-cutly retarded.
r He admonished gentle acn Â»b (jvevy their ,at-
[Volume XIII.
tachment ro their country, rather by proyid*
ing measures jfcr its defence, than by depu
ting about refcinoga petition; except, in
deed, it were offtich a nature as to ca!l lor a
motion ofcenl'ure against its authors; but in
all other cases, it would be he It either to re
ceive all, or reject all the addrelies that come
lie ihould be content to fuvc none of them.
He did not want the addreflesot his constitu
ents to fay whether he had done right of
wrong ; he was willing they fliould decide
that at his election, lie should have no ob
jection to paisa motion declaring that noad
drefs of this kind should be received. Me
was delirous of fending these proceedings to
sleep among others where l hey would soon be
forgotten; but, by investigations of this kind,
an improper conlequence was given to things
of no importance in themk rves.
Mr. Sitg reaves laid, as he supposed,
that, iu common with other members, thf
gentleman from S. Carolina extended his ad
monition to him, he Ihould express his obli
gation for it; but he believed\i would have
been well if he had attended to it a little hiuv- -
felf ; ior however frivolous he deemed the
present oppofjtion, he seemed determined,
according to cnttom to have his (liare of the
debate. Thole who lay the oppoliiion to this
reference arises from the leutiincnts \shiefck
these proceedings contain, either mifunder-
Itand what lias been laid, oregregioufly inif-
Itate it. He needed not to have been told
by his colleague that the reference of a petiti
on did not go to an approbation of its senti
ments ; but it had been exprelslv ("aid, that
the objections, to this address did not go ta
the sentiments of it, but to the manner in
which thole sentiments are exprcfTc-d. No
body would have objected to the reference if
these gentlemen hud, in moderate .terms, Ha
ted that the tendency of certain meakires was
to widen the breach betwixt this country and
the French Republic ; but when they fay
this is not only the tendency, bur that it is the
deflgn and object of ecru.n per lons toinvolve
the country in war, ftich inlinuatiom ought
to be rejected as base and abominably inde
cent. Mr. S. quoted the moil objectionable
parts of the address, in of what hÂ«
had (aid. And (hall we be told, said Mr. S.
that the dignity of the legilkiture is not Â®on
cerned in repelling this language f Can the
gentleman from S. Carolina really think this
difcttfiion urtimportint, and that the Legisla
ture is frivoloully employed in repelling foci*
; language ? In his mind, the- rejeitton of fucli
an address was confident with found policy,
good sense and propriety.
Mr. Edmonu laid, he should be one of
the last who would wifli to abridge the right
of petitioning ; but at the fame time that he
would preserve to the people that right, he
should think it neceflary to observe certain
rultfs refpeÂ£ling it. In fanning those rules
5 Congress mtift either agree to receive every
J petition, or eftablilh a criterion by which toÂ»
determine when a petition lhall be received,
â  and when itfhall not. How, said he, do the
1 Court* of Law aft in this refpeit } Every
I man has a right to apply therjk and to ftatÂ»
s his ground of complaint, bat ff he deviates
1 from the fubjett matter'of his complaint, in
f order to (lander the Court, they would cer
-1 tainly immediately dismiss fucli an applicati
* on. He concluded that this House would a
* dopt a similar rule ; but if they went further
e and said thatif two-thirds of a petition be just
r and right, and the other third slanderous and
* abusive, the latter shall be overlooked for the
1 fake ot the former, would it not follow, that
1 men who wifti to abufethe government, would
- take this course of doing it i They certainly
c would. If all petitions, however exprelled,
' were to be received, what would be the con-.
(equence ? It would be the lame as to fay,
s every man may abuse the government in as
n gross terms as he pleased, by way of petition
r or remonstrance, and it would not be refilled
* by Congrels ; and the coufcquence would be,
n that their table woiil,d be.covered with libel*
and (edition. He believed the proper rule
d would be, that whenever petitions are ex
l>rein decent language, they ought *o be
referred; but whenever tne'y cq ltdinany thing 1
e I slanderous or seditious, lie would not refer
'â¢ them.
But the gentleman from S. Carolina fays,
e a great deal of.time woujd be taken up in dif
y culling the propriety or impsopnety of receiv
d ing petitions, and therefore Congress ought
c to come ro a resolution to receive all, or none.
n If gentlemen are disposed to lengthen out de
> bates of this kind, they may certainly do so ;
Â£ but he saw no necelfity for it. He should
think the simple reading of a petition was fuf
e (iciest for members to form an opinion upon
- it. He saw no better course which could be
v taken.
* Mr. Rutledge believed that in refuting
- to commit the refolutio/is of the Virginia peace
- Grenadiers, the House would have nothing to
- apprehend from the' precedent their refufal
- would eltablifl); for it was his good fortune
- to believÂ« there does not exist, in the United
n States, another let of men who would express
e lo Congress their sentiments in such difref
peefcful terms âtheir sentiments were not only
indecent, but ex pre (fed in themoft difreipefi
- ful manner, The grena iiers of Portsmouth,
not content with expreflin * their opinions of
- our attempts to negociate with France, for
>f wh eh p'irpofe they had alfcmbled, had taken
- a review of all the recent public measures, and
- wilhing to inflame the public mind against
them, had condemned them in mass, and
it conducted thcmfelves with the mod studied
indecency. He said studied indecency, because
i- they had not forwarded their indecent me
inorial with a request to their Representative
ro lay it before Cgngrefs,. but had refolvcd
â  - that he should have po/uive orders lo do so.
t Knowing how (enfible he wou-.ld be of their
I- improper conduit [Mr. Parker the
>- Speaker to read the words of till initiations }
e they were 44 that rhey be forwarded to our
v Representative to be Laid before congress" j
I- Mr. R. was glad to rind that these gentle
t, men had, upon reflection, corrected their
it flyle ; he had read an account in the Norfolk
it paper of their proceedings, and in that their*
1- Representative was on/ered, as he hadnienti
at oned. These persons, however, Ijad some
le reafoi for distrusting their keprefentatives,
for he had uniformly voted for fomc of thofc
of mesiHires which they had anathematized, as
of calculated to ruin the country, and deltroy
es the liberties of its citizens, lie had voted for
fs â¢ liaving a navy ; he had voted lor augmenta
ig tion of our military elUbliflunent ; and these

t- j contenthave, that we are the Serraiitt of the People,
t.le> Have leized this occafioii of charging ui
with the intention of bringing about domcftic
fubjugatioh.
. B' l * gentleman from Pennsylvania fays,
if th s be their opinion, the people have a
right to exprefsit. It is true, Mr. R. laid,
that any man has a right tÂ«Â» fend another an
indecent letter ; but the porfon to whom it it
addrelfed has also the right to fay whether he
will receive it or not. These gentlemen might
nave laid, oar commifTioners were scoundrels;
they had aright to fay so, by the reafeningof
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, but it cer
tainly would not be proper for Congress to
give such a paper a reference, it was not an
extreme cale, to suppose the Virginia Gre
nadiers thought our fcnvoys scoundrels, for
there were many', of their way of thinking on
political fubjectt, who regarded thedifpatch
fes as a fabrication of the Knvo/S and the Ex
ecutive, contrived for the purpose of involv
ing us in a war with' France, and he had been
told thar half the people of this city believed
the Executive had practised this deception.
Whatever right people may have to hold and
ekprefs these opinions, he thought if they
were fenr ro Congress they ought not to be
Countenanced by a reference.
But gentleman fay, addrefles approving of
the conduct of the Executive and the govern
ment are received objection, whilst
those with contrary sentiments are frequently
objected again#. This was r.ot the cafe ; if
gentieinen would recollect the proceedings of
yesterday, the day before, and of every day
for twenty or thirty days past, they would fee
that thischarge was nor founded. What was
the nature of the firft addresses which were
lent to Congress on thefubject of our present
situation ? It would be recollected they all
opposed arming our vessel- and deprecated
tne meafuresas leading to war. They were,
however, exprefled in decent terms, and tho*
in opposition to the opinions of a majority of
this house, they were received without ob.
-jeÂ£tion. One of these petitions from the eart.
yard presented by the gentleman who (its be
hind him, (Mr. Varnum) was objected toby
a gentleman from Connecticut, he conceiv
ing, on hearing it read, that it contained
some improper and he did not
tvl/h to deny it a reference, but merely re
cjuefted it might lie on the table for a day
it was however immediately committed.* Mr.
R. knew that the people had a right to peti
tion, and that it was the duty of Congress to
attend to their representations; but he also
knew that it was the duty of Congress to
refpeit themselves ft> iar, as to require these
petitions to be expreflfed in decent terms.
What, said .Mr. R. will be the effect in Eu
rope of receiving petitions like the present ?
What will the French Executive (a body in
which every species of corruption is perfoni
fle<l) fay to it? They will not only deny the
truth of what our Commiflioaers have relat
ed, bur they will fry to the people or France,
they .vi!l fay to the people of Europe, "even
in America this calumny is not believed."â
The converfattons of Talleyrand, X, Y, and
Zy as reported by our CommilllonerÂ», they
will fay is a mere contrivance, she production
the Anglo, Mduarchtco, Ariftocratico fac
tion in America. They will fay rhis, and
corroborate it by referring to some of the
fpeechtfs in Congress, and the petition on the
table, in which the French agents are called
unauthorized persons, and their villainy spo
ken of, not with contempt and abhorrence,
but with ridicule. This would be giving to
Citizen Talleyrand and his aflociates the best
judication thev can offer for themselves.
Ms. R. hopca, therefore, the refolntions
would not be referred.

T4?esfiVry Department, May 15th, 1798.
SIR, TT/WING been requeued'to ex-
XjL hibita calculation of the quo
tas of the refpettive states in a tax of two
millions of dollars, proportioned to the num
ber of tree white nprfons, and three-fifths of
the number of Haves, as afcertarned by the
census j also my opinion of w hat would be a
proper rule for apportioning to individuals
the proposed tax on lands, houses and (laves,
I refpectfully iubmit the following refultsand
observations.
The enumeration or census by which the
tax mutt be apportioned, was taken with re
ference to the firft Monday of August, 1790,
tfrhen the number of persons in the United
Srates was as follows :
Free white males of sixteen years
and upwards, including heads of
families,
Free white males under si x teen years 802,117
white females, including heads
of families, 1,556,681
Other free persons, exclulive of
Indians, 59,511
'Total number of free persons, ex
clusive of Indians, 3,*31,631
Slaves 697,697, of which number
three-fifth parts are taken, or, 418,619
Total, or representative number, 3,650,150
The following are the quotas of the respec
tive ftatcSj in a tax of two millions of dollars,
calculated according to their relative num
bers of free persons, exclufiveof Indians,and
including three-fifths of the number of (laves;
to wit : Dollars,
The quotaofNew Hamplhire, 771705.36.'

South-Carolina-, 111,997.73.9
Georgia, 38,814.87.5
Total of the proposed tax, Â»,000,000.
It is proposed that the direst tax be alTefled
to individuals in the following manner -
ift. On dwelling houses, to be diliributed in
to nine clafles, and taxed uniformly in each
class.
ad. On (laves, to be taxed uniformly.
3d. On lands, to be taxed at such a rate ad
valorem in each (late, as with the (urns of
fered on houses and (laves, Â»il^ produce
the entire amount of the sums apportioned
to the refpeflive dates.
It being proposed to la* dwelling houles
and rtaveÂ», by uniform rules, ah estimate of
the sums which may be afltflfed on these ob
jects, appears to be important.
I ft. Of J-welling bouset âThe number of
free persons in the United States, in the year
90,17 was 3,131,631 âThe number at present
may be eftiinated at tour millionsâfit is com
puted that there is a dwelling houle forevery
fevqfc perfonsâol course, that tbeie are about
five hundred and seventy thuufand dwelling
houses ih the United States.
It is propofed,.by the bill as reported, to
elempt from fpecific taxation,
with the lots on which they are ereiled', 1 not
exceeding two acres in any cafe, of which the<
value, is less than two hundred dollars. It is
important toafcertain what would bethe pro
bable effect of an exemption of this nature,
and it is much to be regretted that the public
documents afford no certain data for calcula
tion. After a due consideration of informa
tion, recently obtained, it however appears
probable, that a much more considerable
number of houses would be exeihpted than
was contemplated by the committee âowing
to the great number of settlements which have
been lately formed, and the moderate value
of land, in large diTlriAs of the United States,
it is not unlikely that two hundred and twenty
thousand houses would be included in the ex
emption, as houses are believed to be the inoli
certain and eligible obje&s of taxation, to
which resort can be had ; as incovenie.nces
might arise from an exemption in favor of
what probably is the mod numerous defirip
tiou ot houses in some parts of the country,
and as in new settlements dwelling houses of
small value ought not to be considered as in
dications of poverty, the following claflifica
tion, which is somewhat different from that
reported, is refpeftfully submitted, to wit
lit ClafsâTocomprizc all lioufesand lots not
exceeding two acres, 011 which the fame are
eretted, exceeding eighty dollars in value,
, and not exceeding two hundred dollars,
ad Oafs âTo comprize all houses and lots,
exceeding in value two bundled dollars
and not exceeding fix hundred dollars.
3d ClassâTo comprize all houses and lot
exceeding in value fix hundred dollars, and
not exceeding twelve hundred dollars.
4th ClassâTo comprize all houses and lots
exceeding in value twelve hundred dollars,
and not exceeding two thousand dollars.
sth ClassâTo comprize all houses and lots
exceeding in value two thousand dollars,
and not exceeding four thousand dollars.
6th ClassâTo comprize all houses and lots
exceeding in value four thousand dollar*,
and not exceeding fix thousand dollars.
7th ClassâTo coiijprize all houses and lots
exceeding in value fix thousand dollars, and
not exceeding ten thousand dollars.
Bth ClalsâTo comprize all houses and lo!s
exceeding in valuÂ« ten thousand dollars,and
not exceeding twenty five thouland dol
lars.
9th ClassâTo comprize all houses and lots
exceeding in value twenty five thousand
dollars.
Notwithttanding it is proposed to aflefs a
tax on all houses exceeding the value of eigh
ty dollars, yet a considerable number would
(lill remain exemptedâlt is probable, howe
ver, that if the above mentioned rule of claf
fification should be adopted, that five hun
dred thousand houses would be included.
The following estimate of the number of
houses of each class, and rate of aUefTment,
are submitted to the committee.
Doiiari,
ill Class 150,000 jo cents
each 7J,000
id Class 100,000 do. at Dolls, 1. 50, 300,000 :
3d Clals 100,000 do. at 3 300,000 '
4th Class 30,000 do. at 6 180,000,
sth Class 10,000 at la 110,000 |
6th Class 5,000 at 10 100,000 !
7th Class 3,000 at 30 90,000 1

9th Class 500 at no 60,000
5OO.&00
â lJflimate yfthe produiSl of the pro
posed tax onTioufes dolls. 1,315,000
id. Of Slaves.âA tax of two millions of
dollars apportioned to the aggregate number
of free persons in the United States, and to
two-fifths of the number of Haves according
to the census, would be as follows :
Proportion of 3,131,631, freeper
fons, Â«.77Â°,63j-43
Proportion of 418,619, being
three-fifths of the number of
Oaves, 119,364.57
Total 1,000,000
The number of (laves in the United States
Jias probably increased since the time when,
the cenlus was taken ; but as it will doubtless
be deemed advifeable to exempt certain de-
Icriptions, especially the aged and infirm, it
will not be fafe to calculate on a greater num
ber than fix hundred thouland taxable (laves.
A tax of thirty-eight cents on each (lave, may 1
be calculated to produce, dollars 118,000. â
This sum nearly corresponds with the ratio of
afTefTment to (laves according to the couftitu
tion, which may be presumed to afford a rule
equally equitable in refpett to individuals.
3d, Of LandiâAccording to the preceding
estimate, the tax on houles, as proposed,
would produce dollars, 1,315,000
And the tax on (laves, 118,000
Leaving to be raised by an aflefl
ment ad valorem, upon lands, the
sum of 457,000
Amount ofthe proposed tax,dolls. i,0e0,000
The sum proposed to be afl'efled on lands,
will be found to be less in proportion to other
objects, than would be payable in mod ofthe
dates if the date fyllems should be adopted :
It mud also appear to be a tax really mode
rate when the immense value of that species
of property in the United States is duly con
sidered.âThe variety of the principles upon
which the date afTefTments have been formed,
precludes, however, the podibility of anefti
mate of the probable rate of affeflinent in the
different dates.
To facilitate the receipt of the tax into the
Treasury ; to exemplify the operation of the
law upon the different objefls of taxation ;
to diminish the risk of collection ; and render
the burden as light as polfible to individuals ;
it is proposed that the proportions to be laid
on houses and daves should be immediately
alfelfed and palled to the credit of the respec
tive quotas of dates ; while these parts of the
tax are in a course of collection, arrangements
can be made for taking a valuation of the
lands, and apportioning the balances, to b*'
frolledted as a second indalment of the propo
ed tax. \
I have the honor to be,
â¢ with perfect respect,
Sir,
your obedient servant,

CONGRESS.
Yesterday, the House of Reprelentatives of
the United States, in committee of the whole,
were again engaged in difcufling the motion
of Mr. Gallatin to ftiike out that Jeclion
of the bill for laying and collecting Direct
Taxes, which went to lay three-fourths of
the Two Millions of Dollars proposed to be j
raised by* tax on lands, houses and slaves,
to be railed from houses, the queliion upon |
which, after a long difculTion, was carried
4j to 39. The committee then rose and had ,
leare to fit again.âA bill was reported by '
Mr. Sewall, and made the order for this,
day, for suspending all commercial inter- |
course betweeen the United States and the
French Republicand itsdependencies. The j
Senate informed the house that the President
had approved and signed the art for raising a
Provilional Army, and the art for the further '
protection of the Commerce and Coasts of the
United Stares.âA refoluttpf was proposed to
the house by Mr. Macon propoling an ad
journment of both Houses ofCongrel's on the
t4thofJune. On motion of Mr. Harper, it
was ordered to lie on the table till this day. j
The following address was presented to the

S 1 a,
AT a period so interefling as the present,
when the political situation of the United
States has become so precarious with refpeÂ£t
to the belligerent powers, and especially
the French Republic ; at a time when a
haughty nation, evidently aspiring to the
dominion of the nniverfe and the subjuga
tion of all nations, are repeatedly commit
' ting the most aggravated and unprovked
I depredations 011 Â»ur commerce, refufing to
attend to the just remonstrances of our go
vernment, treating with the most pointed
contempt and negleft its representatives, j
who are furnilhed with the most ample '
powers and inftruftions for adjusting and 1
terminating all our differences amicably, and
j with unparalleled effrontery declaring to '
; the world that we are a divided people, dif
-1 fatisficd with our government, and under
j the arbitrary influence of a foreign nation :
at such a time it becomes a. duty incumbent
on every true and unprejudiced American
to come forward, and, by an open and can
did avowal of his fentimcntt, to
rescue his country from the odium attempt
ed to be cast upuu.by fucli calumnious
afpe^rtre.
We therefore, the fnbfcribers, imprefled ,
with a proper regard for the welfare and I
; happiness of our country, do beg you, Sir, '
i to accept this public teflimony of our .entire
I approbation of the measures adopted by the
j Executive, and relying with the fulleft con
; fidence on "your wisdom, integrity, and
patriotic exertions, in concert with the
other branches of the Legislature, we shall
deem it our indispensable duty to he ready
upon all occasions, with cheerfulnefs, to
contribute, as much as in our power lies, to
the support of government, and the vindi
cation of our national honor and indepen
dence.
With these sentiments, Sir, we offer
our sincere and unfeigned wishes for your
personal happiness and prosperity, and that
your services in a political capacity, may
ever meet the deserved approbation of your

The attachment you profefs- for the

4t a numerous and refpedable meet ing of the
c tiz ns of %ueen Ann s county in fbt Jiate of
Maryland at the town of Centre WUah Tburf
day the 17th of May % James Kent, esq. <u>as
uimrfimoufly appointed chairman. and the sol
loetui ig refo/utlou <was unanim ufly Adopted :
Resolved, That James Tilghman, JofhuaSe
ney, Joleph HoppÂ»r Nichoifon, Richard Titgh
man Earle and William Carmichael, esquires be
a committee to prepare an address to the Presi
dent, Senate and Honfe of Keprefentatives of
the United StateÂ® approbating the conduct of the
Executive in the late negotiations with the re
â¢ public of France, and pledging our live* and
fortunes to support our country in repelling any
invasion or upon our foveriegnty and in
dependence.
Whereupon the committee retired and after
I'omc time reported to t!?e meeting the following
address which was unarnmoufly agreed la.
To the Pr FfiDFN t, and House of y
UEPRfcSKNTATJVFS of theti NITRD STATES
of America.
The critical situation into which America
has been thrown by the late condudl of a foreign
nation, having justly excited the attention cf
our fellow citizens throughout the LJr.ii>n a VVe
the p;ople of Queen Ann's county in the, State
of Maryland, feeling ourfrlves deeply intercfted
in the common cause of our country have aflem
bled for the purpose of exprefling our fentimentt
on the present profpe.s) of our political affairs.
With pleasure we inform you that the inflec
tions of our Executive tothe Envoys of the Unit
ed States lately commiflioned to the republic of
France, are in our opinion calculated to pro
mote peace and harmony with that nation and
meet our entire approbation. We feel the ut
most indignation at any threat to destroy our in
dependency and at the fuggefiion of the idea
that we could poflibly be a dividec} people when
the great intercfts of oi%r country arc at itake.
We lament that all exertions for the continuance
of peace have hitherto proved fruitlefs ; but we
took up to the conftitured authorities of our
government with the firmeft reliance on their
wisdom and their virtue to prepare us for ap
proaching events, and if we are at last compell
ed to uiifheathe the sword in defence of our
common rights, the people of America may
with confidence appeal to the God of nations
for the justice of their cause.
War the fata! fco Â»rge of mankind we conffder
as thehcavieft of all human calamities ;& would
approve of every measure to avert itsrhorrors,
which would be cenfittent with our national
honor. But while we deplore it as the curse of
nations, permit us to offer you our assurance*,
that if war is the dreadful alternative to which
we must eventually resort, we are ready at the
expence of our lives and fortunes to defend tbofe
rights which our fathers and ourselves during our
glorious revolution contributed to establish, â
whatever may be our attachment to the princi
ples of the French revolution, whatever anxiety
we may feel for the establishment of a govern
ment in France on the basis of the equal rights
of mankind, the fame spirit of patriotism which
proclaimed our freedom and independence, a
gain loudly calls upon us to remember that we
are Americans and commands us to prefer the
intereftsof that country which gave us birth to
those of any otherin the-univerfe.

to this port, taken and sent in there a few
weeks ago, dollars and a
valuable cargo on board, by the Brilifh
frigate Fhetis, Captai > Cochran.
Upon the whole I am of opinion that the
said Ichoouer HeAor is American property.
That the claimant He>bert Read, removed
frrm his own country in a time of perfeft
peace and became acitizen ofthe United States
before ihe ratificati >u of the treaty of amity,

Heftor is in the f.me fitiiation.âT)\'t the
citizens of America have a right as neutrals
to trade to an I from the ports of the Spanish

have granted licences to Spanish subjeCts to
bring provisions and other refrefhments for

That no fraud or collusion in the present cafe
has appeared, but the business has been carri

of the before mentioned licence. Ido there

although every effort w s exerted, which a

AT a time when a military fpiiit pervades
the whole Onion, when troops and compa
nica ofhorie and foot, are forming asd num
bering, it appears a matter of surprise that
so little should be thought about discipline
and subordination Giving the gentlemen
forming these several corps every credit for
their spirit, iirdor and courage, which they
claim, it is neceflary to hint to tbem, that
an uniform oii'y (however tmli-ary in its ap
pearance) will be of no other use in battle
than to didinguidi thenj,as an easy prey to a
1 old and well trained enemy. Horsemen,
in particular, should remark and remember,
that unitfs their h irfes as w,.11 as themf:!ves
are well prepared and under peifeft control,
that they are more likely to crcateconfufion
and dismay in their own, than in the army
of the enemy ; and that to be any way ufe
ful they mud be drifHy disciplined.âA Ve- '
teran ofthe revolutionary war makes these re
marks, for the purpose and with the hope of
their being attended .to ; and further ob.
serves, that v hile a nu'lita y academy for tlie
foot is eftabhfhed in the Northern Liberties,
and a riding school near the Centre in the
City, and both undertfie direftion ofmen, ac
knowledgedly capable of performing all they

Mit. COBBETT,
AT this present crisis, rijclieve it an indif-|
penfable duty T owe to my family, and to my
personal fafely, tÂ© acquaint the public with a
short detail of fadls relartng td.'my condu-ii in
this country, my objedl is to prevent if poflible,
any contiMence being pi iced in the wrong insin
uations, you have published in the of'
Oiflober of lait year, and recently in re
marks on Mr. Btbwtt'tf note 1 I'uch publications
being calculated not only to deprive me and my
young children of the vary means of fubfiftance,
but alfoto expose me to public view as a dange
rous Frenchman, and capable of making maii
cioti9 use of the liAsof fubferibers in my hands ;
however, I am certain that Mr. Fenn.; nor aiiy
of his fubferibers would hot feel the Icafl unea
linefs to fee their names published, or even dis
closed to the directory ot France.
In the year 1792, I arrived in Philadelphia
(from Germany where I lived with my parents
Rnce the age of 14} a'tcr one year's refibeuce I
was united iu the bands .of matrimony with a
woman, a native American; hence I took the
firm resolution to ft ay in this country, and to
become a peaceable citizen of the f United States
Mv condutf and roy Vlemeanor can be ascertain
ed by my neighbors and other acquaintance: in
fine, in the year 1793 I took the oath befor#
a magistrate to support the constitution, and I
am considered as 3 citizen (having also for five
years pall, paid the taxes*) and entitled to pof
lels the confidence of my employer!*.
I have been for 4 years employed in the post- 1
office and afterwards by Mr. Brown, until my
propofa!* were agreed to by Mrfirs. Fenfto,
Wache, Browii and Bradford. In coqfequeuce
thereof, i have for fourteen months sent with
the uimoft mipatiality and nt ention.lire papers 1
of the fevcral printersâYour complaints are '
all unfounded *s well is yourcharees.
After this, I hope that your remarks on the
above, and what you have already said, will
not injure me in the miitds of the public.
/ have the honor to be, Sir, ;

ps your ovjn authority, that my name vjas. not
entered in the, tax books. at
WE, the fubferibers, having employed Mr.
Jacob Rofet in the month of April, 1797, for
the purpose of em-losing and preparing our pa
pers for the Poft-Cffice, do hereby certify, that
they have been fmce that period for warded ,to
our fubferibers, as far as we are aole
to afceitain, with the flri&eft regularity ou his

r The two thousand men of French froopt
which arrive here from Genoa will bt follow
ed by three chotifand more which are ex
pected there from Marfcillej. Another body
arrives by Mount Cenij.
â¢ Thf military movements give rife to va
rious conjctlures. It it probable we shall j
soon understand their ohjed, as well as the
' cause of the augmentation of Austrian
I troops in Italy. It is said, the French
troops on the 4th entered Lijgano without 1
experiencing any resistance. The gen. Ca- j
fain having quieted Corsica wilt return to
Genoj. The chief of the rebels called
Grtferri has been made prisoner, and, with
ftveral of Ais accomplices sent before a mi
litary tribunal at Baftia.
It is said in a Gerfoefe paper, that difpit
ches and a corrcfpondence between Turin j
atid Vienna have been intercepted, and that
this discovery might have serious conftquen
ces, as well as several important papers seiz
ed at Rome. The farre paper fays, that I
1.8,000 men are to aflemble at Mantua, and i
that aceording to appearances, the iftab-
IKhment of the Roman republic will bring '
about great changes in Italy, as it cannot â¢
be made to accordÂ»with the treaty of Cam- j
po Formio. Already it is said, (adds that j
paper) that the taking poflcffion of Venice '
has been, but provisional. Thus while bey- !
ond the bulletins and gazettej
announce tl.at Austria is about extending I
its palTeffions in Italy on this fide 'he Adige '
a hope is entertained that (he will abandon
part of her new acquifitio's. We are vcrv !
impatient to know whieh of these conjeo j
tures wjll be verified by the event.

The Citizen Ochs appeared yesterday for
the firft time in our national aflembly. He
described the heartfelt emotions he experitn
ced in feeing in the great hall of the Senate
those representatives of the people, who, Im
til now had never appeared there but,in a
supplicating attitude. He declared to the
aflembly, th.>t mere than once he had pre
sented, but always without success, to tfce
secret council, the views of the French re
public, and the necefity of renovating the
constitution of the country; that France,
would not fuffer in her neighbourhood, any
oligarchical (late ; oec a life that species of
government is much more hurtful to her,
than monarchies ; that in general Switzer
land had 101 l its ttrenijth and refpe&ability,
adhering now to one powef, now to another
there to beg commiflions for officers and
ribbands, and had played a part of a troop
of satellites, rather than that of a free po
wer ;that it was high time to come back to
ancient principles &c. As an eleft ion of a
Prcfident of the national efiembly was about
to be proceeded with, the Citizen O hs was â 
unanimously chosen.
He is nowfufficiently avenged against' he
efforts which calumuy had made to injure
him in the opinion of the people ; for the 1
numerous partizans of our a licit M govern- 1
ment had succeeded in producing in a cla
mour for his head, dining the three tnmul
tuous days of Feb. 28, March Ift and 2d,"
bv spreading the report, that he wished not -
only to overturn the coriftitutiou of Bade,
and that of all Switzerland, but to fell his
country to the French republic.

LONDON, March 16 }
Confidential letters received from Raftadt
by the la (I mail ftate~thn? as soon as .the
Congress ha 3 fettled the affairs of Germany
another negociat ion for peace between this
country and France will be opened, under
the mediatioiiofthecourts of Berlin, Vienna,
and Petersburg /
From the official report publifned by the
government of Berne, on the pretended Taf
faffination of two French huflars in the vil
lage of Thierens, it clearly appears, that
these two huflars, yefufed anlwering the que
stion of the Swiss fenrriesâWho they were?
That one Â«f these huflars fell with his drawn
sword on one oftthe sentinels, and wounded
him in the face ; whereupon the latter fired
in defence of his life, and killed the hussar ;
that she other buffer then attacked the other a
fen try, and shared the fawe fate ; that nei- t
ther the government nor commandant of *
the place tbok the Iraft part in this tranfaft- j
ion, and that on the firft intelligence there
of, the government of iieroe offered general \
I Menard any faiisfa&ton he might demand,
anil even iurreoucrcil the two feuti.els up
to him.
All these fafls arc,prored by the vcrb.'J
ptveefs drawn up on the (pot, and yet tlx
pretended outrage is allegrd by the Freix h
government' aa iht motive for the French
troops entering theierritory of Berne, in tie
fame manner as the death ofgec eral Duphois
who was killed at the bead of a band of re
bels,ferved as a prttrxt for occupying Rome.
. Such are the pelitiesl proceedings of the
Great Nation.

all hope of revolutionizing other ccuntr ei f

No book displayÂ» a more sublime theology, in
culcates a purvr morality, or breathes a more ar

unknown before ot moral and intelle&nal enjoy

The avidity with which the clergy and other
learned chara&erain New-England, have purchas
ed the English ediflon of this delightful pet for m
ance.and the opi ion entertained by them ; and
warranted by experience, that although written
before the M Age of Reason,** a part of it con

than any thing publiflicd Grcc, are perhaps a fnfti

Philosopher, the friend of Â«rder and government
are equally interested, and by which they will be
equally gratified
