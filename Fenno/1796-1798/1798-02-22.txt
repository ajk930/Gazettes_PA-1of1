WEDNESDAY âFEBRUARY 21.
â  < Mr VtnV.li, from the committee to whom was
referred tht amendm nt> of tha tenate to tk< bill ,
appropriating a (uu> of mouey for holding a treaty '
with the !nd;'tnt, their title to land is I
the (late of Tenacffea ot North Carolina, nade a J
report, recommtsiding an agreement to all the a- 3
mendments, except oat, to which they recom
mended a dlfagrctmeat. The amendments agreed C
to related to Jlriking out the dates of Tcuacfiee
and North Carolina, leaving the diredien to eke
Pr fident of the Uaited States, in general terms to t
hold sack treaty or treaties with the Indians (with- (
eat mentioning any particular tribo) as he Ihall
think proper. The amcridaoent which the com
mittee recommended to be diifented from, was in '
the following words : v t
" Provided nothing contained, in this aft stall J
be conflrued to admit an oblipa'ion on the part of
the United States to extingailh for the benefit of
any Nate, or individual citixen, Indian claims to 1
any ljnds lying withia the ttrriUry of tha United *
States." !
This ameldniFHt produced a debate which lifted [
the greater part of the day. It was opposed
by Mifirs. W. Claibornr, Nicholas, Venable, 8. 1
Smi'h, R Williams M'Bowcll, Oallatia, and
Macoa, on the ground of its being a new thing to '
iatrodace such a clause iato a biM of this kiad ; I
that the bill was compete without it, and tkat to
agree to this amendment would amount to adeni J
al of the claim againd the United States of the pt
titieners from the state of Tenref-e and Otht rs,to *
an extinguilhmeut ef the Indian title to their lands,
wLich they were fitisfied was well founded, and a c
denial of which wruld be eqaally unjail aad im- (
politic ; that it would be bell to kt this qaeflion
remain untouched for the present, leaving it to
the President to afl it he (hall fee proper ; as if c
the petitioners and others had Â» cki r, the amend- 1
mcnt proposed eouldnot take it away ; it could
therefore, have no other cfifeil than a bad one, sit ,
might, an.l it was believed would be considered as a
declaration igiinfl all pcrfons who had claims cf :
this kind agsiinlt the Un'ted States ; that the per- '
sons who would be affeclcd by such a dedaraticn
were very numerous; that those who had been t
drivm from off their lands in the state of Tenacf a
fee, and who had in e Â»fe<iuence exi erienctri the ,
greatest difirefs, might he induced, fromadefpair
of redrrfs, to go over to the Spanish territory, or J
iufift upon holdidg their lands in dcfiaace of the
late treaty with the Cherokee Indians; that the t
former alteraitive was by do means defiralile, but
the latter might involve the Uaited States in a iVar
with ih, Indiaas.
This amendment of thethe Senate was advo- ?
cated by Mcffra. Sitgrcaves, N. Smith, Uaiper, f
Sewall, Gordon, Otis, and Dana, as nccefl'ary \
to eflablifh the principle upon which the law t
was paffrd. The bvifinefs originared, they flat-
td, upon a memorial froaa the inhabitants of
Ter#eiTee, Â« h<Te claims for rcdrefs agaiaft the
United States, had always been advocatei upon
the gtotiod of jufiice; whereas it was believed i
,hat the pre f cnt bill hafi been agreed to upon the
ground of policy, by the greiter part of t.' ofe 1
who vo'ed fnr it. It was Heceffary, therefore, (
to introduce a daufe of this kind, to ihew upon
w'l at ground the law did pass, otherwise it might
hereafter be infilled that the law was predicatad
upon a convidlion of the jufiiee of ike claims of J
'hefe aitizens upon the United States, which it
was prefumed,*"ne house were neither prepared
it prefcnt, to admit n r deny. They wjlhed 'â¢
this queftiAn undecided, and denied that
his clause which was introduced for that pwr
pof*, could be condrued as a declaration agaiuft
tha right of t e claimants to' redrafs from the '
((overnaient of the United States. It was in- '
tended, and could only be so considered, as a 1
saving rlaiife against eonfequences which might i
be attempted to be drawn from the law, and .
whieh it was not intended to provide for.
The Yeas and Nays being called for upon the

The report of the feleft committee hay
ing been negatived, the question was now u
pon agreeing to the amendment itfelf.
Mr. Bayard moved to amend the amend
ment, by linking out the word territory and
inserting the words " limits of the United
States," which moiion was carried 47 to 41.
The question on the amendment was then
put and carried 47 to 46.
Mr. S. Smith called up for decision the
resolution which he laid upoa the table the
other day, for obtaining from the colleflors
of the fevtral ports of the United States a
statement of veflels captured or detained fcy
foreign â  nations, belonging to the Uuitcd
States since the id July, 1795.
Mr. J. Williams doubted whether the col
lectors could give the information required.
Mr. S. Smith believed they could. The
Senate he said. had adopted a resolution of
a fimiiar purport with this, but he did not
think it fufficiently particular, which was
the reason of his introducing this.
Mr. Gordon did not fee any neceflity for
adupting this rtfolution, since the Senate
had already pafled one of a fimiiar tendency.
Mr. Thatcher was in favour of the re
solution ; butdidnetthink it went farenough
back.
Mr. J. William* moved to ftrikc out the
ift July, 1795, in order to '"krt "f">"the
ratif taticn of the Britijh Treaty."
Mr. S. Smith thought the ift July, 1795
a proper period ; but if the gentleman fram
' Maflachufetts would bring forward a propo
'f fition to have aftatement from the commerce
ment of the European war, he should not ob
jett to !{. Many attempts had heretofore
been obtain a correft lift sf .captures
but it had never been cJFcfted. The lalf fef- I
Con an imperfeft account was laid before the
house collefted from newspapers ; he belie
ved the ceurfe now proposed would produce
more fatisfaftian than had yet been Â«.btained
on this head.
Mr. Thatcher moved that the statement
should commence from the ill â¢of Oftober,
1792, when neutral vefTels were firft. ltopped
in the ports of England, a period which whs
a few months previous to the breaking ,out
of the war betwixt France and England.
Mr. S- Smith consented to this alteration
Mr. Harper moved to ftriTte out the ift
of Oftober 1792, for the purpose of inser
ting " from the ratification ef the Briti/h
treaty." He did not fee why the House
(hould a(k for a long- (lory of captures since
the year The iibjeft required wis* a
simple one, and lay within a much narrower
eoripaf-j. Tt was merely to obtain a come
parative ftatenient ofcapturesmadeby Franc
and England within a certain period. To
take the account so far back, would only
serve te ret-Â®i the enquiry, without being
of any real uft. â¢
The question was put on this amendment
and negatived, there being only *3 voted in
favor of it.
The question then recurred on the resolu
tion as amended by Mr. Thatcher's piopo
iition.
Mr. Allen moved to add, " and so
cause." He did not know that the propof
ed enquiry, could be of any other use than
to fatisfy curiosity ; but", if any part of it
could be of use, he thought it would be
well to have the cause of capture afiigned.
Mr. Otis hoped this amendment would
not obtain, as it would be very puzzling,
indeed, to know for what cause our vessels
had been despoiled and captured.
Mr. J. Williams said, if it were
to distinguish betwixt fa.r and illicit traders
amongst the captures, he should be glad;
but he feared this objeft could not be accom
plished.
Mr. Sitgreaves remarked, that thongh
the colleftors could not in all cases, give J'.n
answer to this enquiry, they might in some.
Indeed, be did not know that they tould
give the other information required, any
more than .this, as he knew no mode by
which they coyid get pofTeffion of it. If 1
they could not answer this enquiry, it would
be easy for them to fay so. He hoped,
therefore, it would be agreed to.
The motion was put and negatived, there
being only 26 votes in favour of is.
The question was then taken on the reso
lution, and carried, there being 58 votes in
favour of it. Adjourned. â

The following petition is now before the
Legiflatuie of this Comro o"nwealth.
To the Senate and House of Reprrfentativej
of'the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in
General AJfcmbly.
The Memorial and Petition of sundry in
habitants of the borough and county oÂ£
Lancaster,
Respecttullt Shew:
THAT your memorialists deem it; not
only expedient for the interests of this com*
pnonwealth, but ftriftly roafonable' that a
participation in the advantages refnlting
from the exportation of the products* of this
state to foreign countries, should not be fa
cilitated to the inhabitants of another state,
to the matiifeft injury of. our own export
trade; and, more efpeeially, whilst the le
gislature of such other state, declines to
concur with that of Pennsylvania, in open
ing the long contemplated canamunicatipn
between thÂ« navigable waters of both Hates.
That, although this populous and fertile
state poflefies only one sea-port town, the
waters of the river Sufquehanna pursue a
course of many hundred miles through the
heart of the country ; and, by itsinterlock
ings with other boatable waters, as well as
by means of the turnpike road froqi tie bo
rough of Lancaster to Philadelphia, the
communication between the interior country
and that capital seaport is rendered cafy and
commodious.
That the town of Columbia, at Wright's
Ferry, on Sufquehanna, will, by,its favor
able position (independently of other town#
above it, on the fame waters) become a
very convenient mart and place of depot, for
the river trade, tending to the mutual ben
efit of the agricultural and commercial in
ter eft s of Pennsylvania in general.
That, with an obvious reference to those
important interests, the Legislature of Pent
fylvania, by au aft passed the 9th of Mareh
1771, declared the river Sufquehanna, "Jts
far down as IVrigbt's Ferry," to be a pufe
lia stream and highway, for the purposes Â«f
navigation up and down the fame, and the
measures since carried into effeft, nndtr the
fanftion of the Legislature, for improving
the navigation of that river, above thV town
of Columbia, have greatly contributed to
facilitate an intercourse cf trade between the
northern and western parts of the state an!
the port of Philadelphia.
That your memorialists conceive the gen
eral prosperity of Pennsylvania, lefpefting
not only its foreign trade, but its agriculture
and manufa&ures, to be in a very considera
ble degree dependent on the promoting fucli
a reciprocity of these several iuterefts among
its citizens, as may yield to the state the
greatest advantages which can be derived
from an union of those refonrces. Unde*
this imprelfion, your memorialists liave no<
ticed with concern, meafiwes pursued by
pcrlorts not acting under any public authori
ty of this state, for clearing the channel of
the Sufquehanna, between Columbia and
that part of the riter which it interfeftcd by
â¢ the southern boundary line of this state.â<â 
â¢ The avowed defigti of these â¢pefatioas( whicll
your memorialists nndcrftand are intended to
be pcrfilled in) is to render the city of Bat
â  timore the mart for the products of a great
portion of Pennsylvania; and for fupplyiug
. in return foreign merchandize for the eaÂ»-
, fumptiun of its inhabitants:âAnd the ob
vious tendency of an intercourse of that ra
-1 ture and extent, with another fate, without
- it's government interchanging similar bene
t fits with this commonwealth, as,it has the
power of doing, is to permit that other state
to erjcy an undue advantage overtur o"wn,whilst we pilTsrfs the right Â«f withholding j br
fueh permiflion. J to
Viewing, therefore, theenjirymentof these , fu
Mitrequited advantages, by the inhabitints jcc
of the state of Maryland, as operating to dc
the manifeft injury of the general intereth i
of this state; and coufidering the Legifla- ti:
ture of Pennsylvania, ,as the to
guardians of its welfare, your petitioners to
most refjie&fujly prav, that your honorable tii
body, will pass a taw to prohibit any person , a
or persons, m*t legally authorized by this j
state, from removing any obftriiflion to the I pi
navigation of the river Sufquehanna, be- of
tween the town ef Columbia aforefaid, and le<
the Southerh boundary line of this state. p;
And your petitioners will ever-pray, &c. or

Reviewing with deep regret the injury we
as citizens sustained by the number of ille
gal votes taken at the last general eleftion,
which, with the difperfionof many of the
good citizens, who were prevented from
voting by diforder then raging
in Philadelphia, we believe to have been the
cause of that truly patriotic citizen Benjamin
R. Morgan not bring re-ele&ed a Senator,
and as our gratitude for his pad services and
confidence in his difpefition to promote our
iutereft in the Legislature in future is not
leflened thereby, therefore, resolved unani

AT a juncture when tb* of c
a Commit* ia I treaty with France may soon
become an objeJt of difcufiion, a work of this kind _
becomes cxsremely ufetui to those eititens of the
United States, who may be defirons to citable them
fclves to view this fubjed, under its various af
petfts ; at>d they will have the fatisla&ion to be J
furnifeed with the neceflary data, to judge of the
ufeiulnefs of this tranfaAion.
This work is principally diftioguifhed by the }
richness of the obfervationa, the pcrfpieuity of the 1
it'eas, and the modeily of the theory which it
contains. At Pars, a man of wit obfarved, that J
this work was like a rich farmer's barn, heaped up
to the very roof with ufeful produce. It is'addref â¢ ?
fed to the unfortunate La Favetti, in letters, 1
which fugitive form, the author who could only 1
devote a few wefks to this occupation, was obliged r
to adopt. Although are ill many f
refpeAs different at the present day, from what 1
â¢hey were in the year 1790, when these letters a
were written, yet it may be justly said, that so raa- 1
ny absolute and permanent data ft ill remain, that f
the judicious reader will not appreciate the work
lesson that account ; on the contrary, as many of c
the alterations, which have been made, are the re- *
fult of the author's remark*, it will ftrve to con
vince him that in all tranfailioijs, between free
nations, every thing may ec from the ef- '
sorties truth and juflice.

LETTER 111.
Effayin the form Â« f a table**, to appraise the im

whether it can be better lurnithed from France or j
Englandâlt is principally on this fubjeft (which j
would have ailomlhed a mere thforii!) that the author |
fppears to evince great commercial experience These j
kind of tableaux, unluckily as difficult to obtain as
they are much to be desired, are the only sure guides
the statesman can take for th' policy of treaties, de
prived of which he is continually deceiving or decei
ved. We cannot too much admire the apparent ex
aÂ£boefÂ» of colonel Swan's calculations ; and although
the propbtfies of Lord Sheffield have already been
oon'raditteri by experience, and by several able pern,
yet it iscuitous to fee the author of the prelent work,
dispute with him the only grour d on which he has
not been hitherto attacked, by proving that France,
under the requited condition, will be better able
than Great Britain to supply us with (everal articles,
which the English authoi allots exclusively and forev
er to the latter; the author's partiality afieSl on (if he
has any) does not appear to have at any time created
a partiality of judgment. The result of this calculation
is that in <7091 that is to fay, zta period when arts
and manuta&ures did pot present in France the vatt
means and probabitt'.y of extension which they now
poffc fÂ«. that even in 1789, it was presumable, that
France would not only have the means to supply one
half ofanv given quantity of the of France
and > ngland but also to enter into competition
with Great Britain for the remainder, in proportion
to the wisdom of her government, and ifce industry
of her inhabitants.
LETTER IV.
Calculation of the exportations of the United States,
and particular examination of their suitableness to
France; this is one reason why, notwithstanding the
excellent work ot Mr. Tench Coxe, Mr. Swan's ta
sJeau is by no means fupetfluous . the principle of the
advantages which would result to France from the
importation us provifiom and raw materials, is every
where applied 1 and it is upon this argument, that
the author establishes his demands to the French go
vernment, for the limited admission of the produc
tions ol his country into France.
LETTER V.
